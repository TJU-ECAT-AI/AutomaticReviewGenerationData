[1] "In presence of N2O, catalytic sites work in a more reduced state. N2O inhibits the adsorption of O2, so limiting the formation of non-selective oxygen species (from O2) and/or the oxidation rate of the catalysts. This explains the increases in the yield and selectivity to propene and the lower O2 consumption when N2O is added."

[2] "When N2O is added, hydroxyls decrease and the bonds corresponding to M=O increase further. This indicates, unequivocally, that the interaction of N2O with NiMoO4 modifies the nature of the sites on the surface of the catalysts, decreasing the OH and promoting the formation of M=O bonds."

[3] "It is not excluded that N2O (via the dissociated oxygen species O) could also participate directly as oxidant. If this is the case, the results, in particular at high N2O concentration, must thus be regarded as due to the superposition of both above described phenomena."

[4] "The nature of the oxygen species formed on the surface of the catalyst by dissociation of N2O has been studied extensively using surface potential measurement on MoO3/SiO2 catalysts [10]. At lower temperatures (413553 K) and in N2O atmosphere, N2O is decomposed following the reactions:

N2O + e → N2 + O-
O- + e → O2-"

[5] "In fact in absence of oxygen, N2O (10% in volume) is able to produce a conversion of propane of 8.5%, propene in appreciable yield (2.4%) with a higher selectivity (28.7%) while in presence of oxygen (5% in volume (namely the same amount of oxygen atoms)), a conversion of 10% with a yield of 2.1% and a selectivity of 20.6 is observed."

N2O shows several advantages as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) compared to other oxidants, particularly in terms of propylene selectivity:

1. Increased selectivity: N2O promotes a more reduced state of catalytic sites, which leads to higher selectivity for propylene. This is due to N2O inhibiting O2 adsorption, limiting the formation of non-selective oxygen species.

2. Modification of catalyst surface: N2O interaction with catalysts like NiMoO4 modifies the surface sites, decreasing OH groups and promoting M=O bonds formation. This change in surface chemistry contributes to improved selectivity.

3. Dual role: N2O can act both as an inhibitor of non-selective oxidation and as a direct oxidant through its dissociated oxygen species (O-).

4. Higher yield and selectivity: In the absence of O2, N2O produces appreciable propene yield (2.4%) with higher selectivity (28.7%) compared to O2 (2.1% yield, 20.6% selectivity).

The main catalysts employed in this process, as mentioned in the literature, include NiMoO4 and MoO3/SiO2. These catalysts show good performance in N2O-ODHP reactions.

Critical challenges associated with catalyst deactivation and stability are not explicitly discussed in the given literature. However, based on the information provided, some potential challenges could include:

1. Maintaining the reduced state of catalytic sites over time.
2. Preventing over-oxidation of the catalyst surface.
3. Balancing the concentration of N2O to achieve optimal selectivity without compromising conversion.

To address these limitations and make N2O-ODHP more feasible for practical implementation, some strategies or research directions could include:

1. Developing catalysts that maintain a stable reduced state under reaction conditions.
2. Optimizing N2O concentration in the feed to balance selectivity and conversion.
3. Investigating the synergistic effects of N2O with other oxidants or promoters.
4. Studying the long-term stability of catalysts under N2O-ODHP conditions.
5. Exploring the mechanism of N2O dissociation and oxygen species formation on different catalyst surfaces to design more efficient catalysts.
6. Investigating methods to regenerate catalyst activity in-situ to prolong catalyst lifetime.

These approaches could potentially overcome the challenges associated with N2O-ODHP and make it a more viable option for industrial application.

与其他氧化剂相比，N2O作为氧化剂在丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）中显示出几个优势，特别是在丙烯选择性方面：

1. 提高选择性：N2O促进催化位点处于更还原的状态，从而提高丙烯的选择性。这是由于N2O抑制O2吸附，限制了非选择性氧物种的形成。

2. 改变催化剂表面：N2O与NiMoO4等催化剂的相互作用改变了表面位点，减少OH基团并促进M=O键的形成。这种表面化学变化有助于提高选择性。

3. 双重作用：N2O既可以作为非选择性氧化的抑制剂，又可以通过其解离的氧物种（O-）直接作为氧化剂。

4. 更高的产率和选择性：在没有O2的情况下，N2O产生可观的丙烯产率（2.4%）和更高的选择性（28.7%），相比之下O2的产率为2.1%，选择性为20.6%。

文献中提到的该过程中使用的主要催化剂包括NiMoO4和MoO3/SiO2。这些催化剂在N2O-ODHP反应中表现出良好的性能。

文献中没有明确讨论与催化剂失活和稳定性相关的关键挑战。但是，根据提供的信息，一些潜在的挑战可能包括：

1. 长期维持催化位点的还原状态。
2. 防止催化剂表面过度氧化。
3. 平衡N2O浓度以实现最佳选择性而不影响转化率。

为了解决这些限制并使N2O-ODHP更适合实际应用，一些策略或研究方向可能包括：

1. 开发在反应条件下保持稳定还原状态的催化剂。
2. 优化进料中的N2O浓度以平衡选择性和转化率。
3. 研究N2O与其他氧化剂或促进剂的协同效应。
4. 研究催化剂在N2O-ODHP条件下的长期稳定性。
5. 探索N2O在不同催化剂表面上的解离机理和氧物种形成，以设计更高效的催化剂。
6. 研究原位再生催化剂活性的方法，以延长催化剂寿命。

这些方法可能有助于克服N2O-ODHP相关的挑战，使其成为更可行的工业应用选择。
