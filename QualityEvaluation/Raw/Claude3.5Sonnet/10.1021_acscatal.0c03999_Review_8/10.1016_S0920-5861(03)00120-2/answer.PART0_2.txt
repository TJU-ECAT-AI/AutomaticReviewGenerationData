The use of nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) offers several advantages in terms of propylene selectivity compared to other oxidants:

1. N2O promotes a more reduced state of the catalyst, which leads to improved selectivity towards propylene.

2. It inhibits the adsorption of O2, limiting the formation of non-selective oxygen species and reducing over-oxidation.

3. The oxygen produced by N2O dissociation can directly oxidize propane to propene.

4. Addition of N2O results in higher propylene selectivity, with a reported increase of 32% in some cases.

5. The degree of reduction of catalytic sites, and thus selectivity, can be controlled by adjusting the amount of N2O in the feed.

The main catalyst discussed in this study is nickel molybdate (NiMoO4), particularly the α-phase. However, the literature does not provide extensive information on other catalysts employed in N2O-ODHP.

Critical challenges associated with catalyst deactivation and stability are not directly addressed in the given literature. However, the study mentions that the effect of N2O on catalyst performance is reversible but not instantaneous, suggesting that maintaining N2O in the feed is necessary to preserve the selective sites created during the reaction.

To address limitations and make N2O-ODHP more feasible for practical implementation, the following strategies or research directions could be pursued:

1. Optimize N2O concentration: Further research to determine the optimal N2O concentration for balancing selectivity and conversion.

2. Catalyst design: Develop catalysts that can maintain a reduced state even in the absence of N2O, potentially improving long-term stability.

3. Understanding reaction mechanisms: Conduct more in-depth studies on the exact role of N2O and the nature of oxygen species formed during the reaction.

4. Hybrid oxidant systems: Investigate the use of N2O in combination with other oxidants to achieve an optimal balance of activity and selectivity.

5. Process engineering: Develop efficient methods for N2O production and recycling to make the process more economically viable and environmentally friendly.

6. Long-term stability studies: Conduct extended durability tests to assess catalyst performance over prolonged periods and under various conditions.

These strategies could potentially overcome the limitations of N2O-ODHP and make it a more attractive option for industrial implementation.

一氧化二氮（N2O）作为丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）的氧化剂在丙烯选择性方面具有以下优势：

1. N2O促进催化剂处于更还原的状态，从而提高了对丙烯的选择性。

2. 它抑制了O2的吸附，限制了非选择性氧物种的形成，减少了过度氧化。

3. N2O分解产生的氧可以直接将丙烷氧化为丙烯。

4. 添加N2O可以提高丙烯选择性，在某些情况下报告的增幅达32%。

5. 通过调整进料中N2O的量，可以控制催化活性位的还原程度，从而控制选择性。

这项研究主要讨论的催化剂是镍钼酸盐（NiMoO4），特别是α相。然而，文献并未提供关于N2O-ODHP中使用的其他催化剂的广泛信息。

给定的文献并未直接讨论与催化剂失活和稳定性相关的关键挑战。但是，研究提到N2O对催化剂性能的影响是可逆的，但不是瞬时的，这表明在反应过程中需要维持进料中的N2O以保持所创造的选择性位点。

为了解决限制并使N2O-ODHP更适合实际应用，可以考虑以下策略或研究方向：

1. 优化N2O浓度：进一步研究确定最佳N2O浓度，以平衡选择性和转化率。

2. 催化剂设计：开发即使在没有N2O存在的情况下也能保持还原状态的催化剂，可能改善长期稳定性。

3. 理解反应机理：对N2O的确切作用和反应过程中形成的氧物种性质进行更深入的研究。

4. 混合氧化剂系统：研究N2O与其他氧化剂的组合使用，以达到活性和选择性的最佳平衡。

5. 工艺工程：开发高效的N2O生产和回收方法，使过程更具经济可行性和环境友好性。

6. 长期稳定性研究：进行延长的耐久性测试，评估催化剂在长期和各种条件下的性能。

这些策略可能克服N2O-ODHP的限制，使其成为更具吸引力的工业应用选择。
