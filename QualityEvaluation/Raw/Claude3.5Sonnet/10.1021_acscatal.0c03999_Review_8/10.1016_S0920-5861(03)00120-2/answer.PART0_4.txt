[1] "In presence of N2O, catalytic sites work in a more reduced state. N2O inhibits the adsorption of O2, so limiting the formation of non-selective oxygen species (from O2) and/or the oxidation rate of the catalysts. This explains the increases in the yield and selectivity to propene and the lower O2 consumption when N2O is added."

[2] "It is not excluded that N2O (via the dissociated oxygen species O) could also participate directly as oxidant. If this is the case, the results, in particular at high N2O concentration, must thus be regarded as due to the superposition of both above described phenomena."

[3] "In fact in absence of oxygen, N2O (10% in volume) is able to produce a conversion of propane of 8.5%, propene in appreciable yield (2.4%) with a higher selectivity (28.7%) while in presence of oxygen (5% in volume (namely the same amount of oxygen atoms)), a conversion of 10% with a yield of 2.1% and a selectivity of 20.6 is observed."

[4] "The effect produced by N2O is reversible, but the reversibility is not instantaneous after the replacement of N2O by O2 in the feed. This has been observed clearly in DRIFTS experiments. The changes in the intensity of the bands associated to Mo=O induced by the introduction of N2O in the DRIFTS cell remain, to a certain degree, up to 2 h after N2O has been replaced by synthetic air"

N2O shows several advantages as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) compared to other oxidants like O2:

1. Improved selectivity: N2O promotes a more reduced state of the catalytic sites, which leads to increased selectivity towards propene. It inhibits the adsorption of O2, limiting the formation of non-selective oxygen species.

2. Higher yield: The use of N2O results in increased yield of propene compared to using O2 alone.

3. Lower oxygen consumption: N2O addition leads to lower O2 consumption in the reaction.

4. Direct oxidant role: N2O can also act as a direct oxidant, producing propene with higher selectivity compared to O2.

The main catalyst discussed in this study is NiMoO4. The presence of N2O modifies the chemical state of the active sites on this catalyst during the reaction conditions.

Critical challenges associated with catalyst deactivation and stability include:

1. Reversibility of N2O effects: While N2O creates beneficial catalytic sites, its effects are reversible when removed from the feed. However, this reversibility is not instantaneous.

2. Maintaining optimal oxidation state: Balancing the oxidation state of the catalyst is crucial for maintaining selectivity.

To address these limitations and improve N2O-ODHP feasibility, potential strategies include:

1. Developing catalysts that can maintain the reduced state promoted by N2O even after its removal from the feed.

2. Optimizing N2O concentration in the feed to balance between selectivity improvement and direct oxidation effects.

3. Investigating catalyst formulations that synergize with N2O to enhance stability and longevity of the desired catalytic sites.

4. Exploring methods to regenerate the catalyst in-situ to maintain the optimal oxidation state for extended periods.

5. Studying the long-term effects of N2O on catalyst structure and performance to develop more stable catalytic systems.

These research directions could potentially overcome the current limitations and make N2O-ODHP a more viable option for practical implementation in propene production.

与其他氧化剂如O2相比，N2O作为氧化剂在丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）中显示出几个优势：

1. 提高选择性：N2O促进催化位点处于更还原的状态，从而提高了对丙烯的选择性。它抑制了O2的吸附，限制了非选择性氧物种的形成。

2. 更高的收率：使用N2O比单独使用O2能获得更高的丙烯收率。

3. 更低的氧气消耗：添加N2O导致反应中的O2消耗降低。

4. 直接氧化剂作用：N2O也可以作为直接氧化剂，与O2相比能以更高的选择性生产丙烯。

本研究讨论的主要催化剂是NiMoO4。N2O的存在会在反应条件下改变该催化剂活性位点的化学状态。

与催化剂失活和稳定性相关的关键挑战包括：

1. N2O效应的可逆性：虽然N2O创造了有益的催化位点，但从进料中移除后其效果是可逆的。然而，这种可逆性并非瞬时的。

2. 维持最佳氧化状态：平衡催化剂的氧化状态对维持选择性至关重要。

为解决这些限制并提高N2O-ODHP的可行性，潜在的策略包括：

1. 开发能在N2O从进料中移除后仍能维持其促进的还原状态的催化剂。

2. 优化进料中的N2O浓度，以平衡选择性改善和直接氧化效应。

3. 研究与N2O协同作用的催化剂配方，以增强所需催化位点的稳定性和寿命。

4. 探索原位再生催化剂的方法，以长期维持最佳氧化状态。

5. 研究N2O对催化剂结构和性能的长期影响，以开发更稳定的催化系统。

这些研究方向有可能克服当前的限制，使N2O-ODHP在丙烯生产中成为更可行的实际应用选择。
