[1] "In presence of N2O, catalytic sites work in a more reduced state. N2O inhibits the adsorption of O2, so limiting the formation of non-selective oxygen species (from O2) and/or the oxidation rate of the catalysts. This explains the increases in the yield and selectivity to propene and the lower O2 consumption when N2O is added."

[2] "When N2O is added, hydroxyls decrease and the bonds corresponding to M=O increase further. This indicates, unequivocally, that the interaction of N2O with NiMoO4 modifies the nature of the sites on the surface of the catalysts, decreasing the OH and promoting the formation of M=O bonds."

[3] "Anyway, we cannot exclude that the dissociated oxygen (named O) could participate directly as oxidating reactant producing oxygenated products or more precisely propene. This has been verified working under high concentration of N2O."

[4] "The effect produced by N2O is reversible, but the reversibility is not instantaneous after the replacement of N2O by O2 in the feed. This has been observed clearly in DRIFTS experiments."

N2O shows advantages in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) by improving propylene selectivity compared to other oxidants like O2. The main benefits include:

1. Promoting a more reduced state of catalytic sites, which inhibits non-selective oxidation.

2. Limiting the formation of non-selective oxygen species from O2 adsorption.

3. Potentially participating directly as an oxidant to produce propene.

4. Modifying catalyst surface sites to favor M=O bonds over hydroxyls.

The study focused on NiMoO4 catalysts, showing how N2O interacts with and modifies their surface properties. However, the literature does not extensively discuss various catalysts or address catalyst deactivation and stability challenges.

To make N2O-ODHP more feasible, future research directions could include:

1. Investigating a wider range of catalysts to optimize N2O interactions.

2. Studying long-term catalyst stability under N2O conditions.

3. Exploring methods to maintain the beneficial effects of N2O even after its removal from the feed.

4. Optimizing N2O concentration to balance selectivity improvements with potential drawbacks.

5. Investigating the economic and environmental impacts of using N2O as an oxidant on an industrial scale.

N2O shows several advantages as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) compared to other oxidants, particularly in terms of propylene selectivity:

1. Increased selectivity: N2O promotes a more reduced state of catalytic sites, which leads to higher selectivity for propylene. This is due to N2O inhibiting O2 adsorption, limiting the formation of non-selective oxygen species.

2. Modification of catalyst surface: N2O interaction with catalysts like NiMoO4 modifies the surface sites, decreasing OH groups and promoting M=O bonds formation. This change in surface chemistry contributes to improved selectivity.

3. Dual role: N2O can act both as an inhibitor of non-selective oxidation and as a direct oxidant through its dissociated oxygen species (O-).

4. Higher yield and selectivity: In the absence of O2, N2O produces appreciable propene yield (2.4%) with higher selectivity (28.7%) compared to O2 (2.1% yield, 20.6% selectivity).

The main catalysts employed in this process, as mentioned in the literature, include NiMoO4 and MoO3/SiO2. These catalysts show good performance in N2O-ODHP reactions.

Critical challenges associated with catalyst deactivation and stability are not explicitly discussed in the given literature. However, based on the information provided, some potential challenges could include:

1. Maintaining the reduced state of catalytic sites over time.
2. Preventing over-oxidation of the catalyst surface.
3. Balancing the concentration of N2O to achieve optimal selectivity without compromising conversion.

To address these limitations and make N2O-ODHP more feasible for practical implementation, some strategies or research directions could include:

1. Developing catalysts that maintain a stable reduced state under reaction conditions.
2. Optimizing N2O concentration in the feed to balance selectivity and conversion.
3. Investigating the synergistic effects of N2O with other oxidants or promoters.
4. Studying the long-term stability of catalysts under N2O-ODHP conditions.
5. Exploring the mechanism of N2O dissociation and oxygen species formation on different catalyst surfaces to design more efficient catalysts.
6. Investigating methods to regenerate catalyst activity in-situ to prolong catalyst lifetime.

These approaches could potentially overcome the challenges associated with N2O-ODHP and make it a more viable option for industrial application.

The use of nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) offers several advantages in terms of propylene selectivity compared to other oxidants:

1. N2O promotes a more reduced state of the catalyst, which leads to improved selectivity towards propylene.

2. It inhibits the adsorption of O2, limiting the formation of non-selective oxygen species and reducing over-oxidation.

3. The oxygen produced by N2O dissociation can directly oxidize propane to propene.

4. Addition of N2O results in higher propylene selectivity, with a reported increase of 32% in some cases.

5. The degree of reduction of catalytic sites, and thus selectivity, can be controlled by adjusting the amount of N2O in the feed.

The main catalyst discussed in this study is nickel molybdate (NiMoO4), particularly the α-phase. However, the literature does not provide extensive information on other catalysts employed in N2O-ODHP.

Critical challenges associated with catalyst deactivation and stability are not directly addressed in the given literature. However, the study mentions that the effect of N2O on catalyst performance is reversible but not instantaneous, suggesting that maintaining N2O in the feed is necessary to preserve the selective sites created during the reaction.

To address limitations and make N2O-ODHP more feasible for practical implementation, the following strategies or research directions could be pursued:

1. Optimize N2O concentration: Further research to determine the optimal N2O concentration for balancing selectivity and conversion.

2. Catalyst design: Develop catalysts that can maintain a reduced state even in the absence of N2O, potentially improving long-term stability.

3. Understanding reaction mechanisms: Conduct more in-depth studies on the exact role of N2O and the nature of oxygen species formed during the reaction.

4. Hybrid oxidant systems: Investigate the use of N2O in combination with other oxidants to achieve an optimal balance of activity and selectivity.

5. Process engineering: Develop efficient methods for N2O production and recycling to make the process more economically viable and environmentally friendly.

6. Long-term stability studies: Conduct extended durability tests to assess catalyst performance over prolonged periods and under various conditions.

These strategies could potentially overcome the limitations of N2O-ODHP and make it a more attractive option for industrial implementation.
