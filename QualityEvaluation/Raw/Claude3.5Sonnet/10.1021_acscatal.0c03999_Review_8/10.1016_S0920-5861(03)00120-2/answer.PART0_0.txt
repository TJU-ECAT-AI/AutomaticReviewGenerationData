[1] "In presence of N2O, catalytic sites work in a more reduced state. N2O inhibits the adsorption of O2, so limiting the formation of non-selective oxygen species (from O2) and/or the oxidation rate of the catalysts. This explains the increases in the yield and selectivity to propene and the lower O2 consumption when N2O is added."

[2] "When N2O is added, hydroxyls decrease and the bonds corresponding to M=O increase further. This indicates, unequivocally, that the interaction of N2O with NiMoO4 modifies the nature of the sites on the surface of the catalysts, decreasing the OH and promoting the formation of M=O bonds."

[3] "Anyway, we cannot exclude that the dissociated oxygen (named O) could participate directly as oxidating reactant producing oxygenated products or more precisely propene. This has been verified working under high concentration of N2O."

[4] "The effect produced by N2O is reversible, but the reversibility is not instantaneous after the replacement of N2O by O2 in the feed. This has been observed clearly in DRIFTS experiments."

N2O shows advantages in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) by improving propylene selectivity compared to other oxidants like O2. The main benefits include:

1. Promoting a more reduced state of catalytic sites, which inhibits non-selective oxidation.

2. Limiting the formation of non-selective oxygen species from O2 adsorption.

3. Potentially participating directly as an oxidant to produce propene.

4. Modifying catalyst surface sites to favor M=O bonds over hydroxyls.

The study focused on NiMoO4 catalysts, showing how N2O interacts with and modifies their surface properties. However, the literature does not extensively discuss various catalysts or address catalyst deactivation and stability challenges.

To make N2O-ODHP more feasible, future research directions could include:

1. Investigating a wider range of catalysts to optimize N2O interactions.

2. Studying long-term catalyst stability under N2O conditions.

3. Exploring methods to maintain the beneficial effects of N2O even after its removal from the feed.

4. Optimizing N2O concentration to balance selectivity improvements with potential drawbacks.

5. Investigating the economic and environmental impacts of using N2O as an oxidant on an industrial scale.

在氧化脱氢丙烷(ODHP)过程中，N2O相比其他氧化剂如O2，在提高丙烯选择性方面显示出优势。主要好处包括：

1. 促进催化位点处于更还原的状态，抑制非选择性氧化。

2. 限制由O2吸附形成的非选择性氧物种。

3. 可能直接作为氧化剂参与生成丙烯。

4. 修改催化剂表面位点，有利于M=O键而非羟基的形成。

该研究主要关注NiMoO4催化剂，展示了N2O如何与其表面性质相互作用并进行修饰。然而，文献并未广泛讨论各种催化剂或解决催化剂失活和稳定性挑战。

为使N2O-ODHP更具可行性，未来的研究方向可包括：

1. 研究更广泛的催化剂范围，以优化N2O的相互作用。

2. 研究N2O条件下催化剂的长期稳定性。

3. 探索在N2O从进料中移除后仍能维持其有益效果的方法。

4. 优化N2O浓度，平衡选择性改进与潜在缺点。

5. 研究在工业规模上使用N2O作为氧化剂的经济和环境影响。
