[1] "In the presence N2O, catalytic sites work in a more reduced state. N2O inhibits the adsorption of O2, so limiting the formation of non-selective oxygen species (from O2) and/or the oxidation rate of the catalysts. This explains the increases in the yield and selectivity to propene and the lower O2 consumption when N2O is added."

[2] "N2O improves selectivity, probably by: (i) inhibiting the adsorption of O2 and/or (ii) increasing reduction rate of the catalysts. The O produced by dissociation of N2O can oxidise propane to propene."

[3] "The addition of 300 ppm of N2O leads to: (i) a decrease in the conversion of propane (15%), (ii) a modest increase in the yield in propene (11%), (iii) an increase in the selectivity in propene (32%), (iv) a weak decrease in the selectivity in CO2 (7%)."

[4] "An important fact is that when the feed in N2O is stopped, the catalytic performance remains unchanged compared with that in presence of N2O. The performances observed before the addition of N2O are only slowly re-established."

[5] "The nature of the oxygen species formed on the surface of the catalyst by dissociation of N2O has been studied extensively using surface potential measurement on MoO3/SiO2 catalysts."

N2O shows advantages as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) primarily due to its ability to improve propylene selectivity. The main advantages are:

1. Improved selectivity: N2O increases the selectivity to propene by 32% compared to other oxidants like O2.

2. Reduced state of catalytic sites: N2O keeps the catalytic sites in a more reduced state, which is favorable for selective oxidation.

3. Inhibition of non-selective oxidation: N2O inhibits the adsorption of O2, limiting the formation of non-selective oxygen species.

4. Modest increase in propene yield: Addition of N2O leads to an 11% increase in propene yield.

5. Lower CO2 selectivity: N2O causes a slight decrease in CO2 selectivity, indicating fewer side reactions.

The main catalyst discussed in this study is NiMoO4, particularly its α and β phases. MoO3/SiO2 catalysts are also mentioned in the context of studying oxygen species formed by N2O dissociation.

Critical challenges associated with catalyst deactivation and stability include:

1. Slow re-establishment of original performance: When N2O feed is stopped, it takes time for the catalyst to return to its original state.

2. Potential for over-oxidation: At higher temperatures or concentrations, N2O can lead to non-selective oxidation.

3. Dynamic nature of active sites: The oxidation state of the catalyst changes during the reaction, which can affect long-term stability.

To address these limitations and make N2O-ODHP more feasible, the following strategies could be pursued:

1. Optimize N2O concentration: Find the optimal N2O concentration that balances improved selectivity with minimal non-selective oxidation.

2. Develop more stable catalysts: Design catalysts that can maintain their reduced state even under varying reaction conditions.

3. Investigate catalyst regeneration methods: Develop efficient ways to regenerate the catalyst and restore its initial performance.

4. Study the mechanism of N2O dissociation: Further understand how N2O dissociates on different catalysts to optimize the process.

5. Explore catalyst promoters: Investigate additives that could enhance the stability of the reduced catalytic sites.

6. Develop in-situ characterization techniques: Implement methods to monitor the oxidation state of the catalyst during the reaction to better control the process.

7. Investigate the potential of periodic operation: Explore the benefits of alternating between N2O and O2 feeds to maintain optimal catalyst performance.

N2O作为氧化剂在丙烷氧化脱氢(ODHP)中主要因其提高丙烯选择性的能力而显示出优势。主要优点包括：

1. 提高选择性：与O2等其他氧化剂相比，N2O将丙烯的选择性提高了32%。

2. 催化位点的还原状态：N2O使催化位点保持在更还原的状态，这有利于选择性氧化。

3. 抑制非选择性氧化：N2O抑制O2的吸附，限制了非选择性氧物种的形成。

4. 丙烯产率适度增加：添加N2O导致丙烯产率增加11%。

5. 较低的CO2选择性：N2O导致CO2选择性略有下降，表明副反应减少。

本研究讨论的主要催化剂是NiMoO4，特别是其α和β相。在研究N2O分解形成的氧物种时也提到了MoO3/SiO2催化剂。

与催化剂失活和稳定性相关的关键挑战包括：

1. 原始性能恢复缓慢：当停止N2O供给时，催化剂需要时间才能恢复到原始状态。

2. 过度氧化的可能性：在较高温度或浓度下，N2O可能导致非选择性氧化。

3. 活性位点的动态性质：催化剂的氧化状态在反应过程中发生变化，这可能影响长期稳定性。

为解决这些限制并使N2O-ODHP更具可行性，可以采取以下策略：

1. 优化N2O浓度：找到平衡提高选择性和最小化非选择性氧化的最佳N2O浓度。

2. 开发更稳定的催化剂：设计能在不同反应条件下保持还原状态的催化剂。

3. 研究催化剂再生方法：开发有效的方法来再生催化剂并恢复其初始性能。

4. 研究N2O分解机理：进一步了解N2O在不同催化剂上的分解方式，以优化过程。

5. 探索催化剂促进剂：研究可以增强还原催化位点稳定性的添加剂。

6. 开发原位表征技术：实施在反应过程中监测催化剂氧化状态的方法，以更好地控制过程。

7. 研究周期性操作的潜力：探索在N2O和O2供给之间交替的好处，以保持最佳催化剂性能。
