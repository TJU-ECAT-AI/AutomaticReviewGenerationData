[1] "It is clear from Figure 5 that there is no significant difference in the spectra of fully oxidized VOx species and VOx species having been reoxidized for 5 s in an O2 flow after C3H8 pretreatment. As compared to O2, reoxidation of reduced VOx species with N2O is slower, since these species are fully oxidized after ca. 30 s on steam in N2O."

[2] "Since transient responses of carbon oxides contain both labeled (18O) and nonlabeled (16O) oxygen species (Figure 7), two independent reaction pathways in COx formation can be suggested: (1) with participation of labeled (adsorbed) and (2) nonlabeled (lattice) oxygen."

[3] "Combining the results of in-situ UV/vis analysis and transient isotopic experiments with catalytic data, two important conclusions about the role of O2 and N2O in the ODP reaction were derived: (1) the ability of oxidant for reoxidation of reduced VOx species and (2) the nature of selective and nonselective oxygen species."

[4] "Besides influencing the reduction degree of VOx species, N2O does not produce nonselective adsorbed oxygen species (possibly of biatomic nature), which are formed from O2 and catalyze nonselective consecutive propene oxidation to COx."

The use of nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) offers several advantages in terms of propylene selectivity compared to other oxidants, particularly oxygen (O2). 

N2O reoxidizes reduced VOx species more slowly than O2, which leads to a higher degree of reduction of VOx species under reaction conditions. This higher reduction degree is essential for achieving high primary propene selectivity and suppressing consecutive propene oxidation to CO and CO2.

The catalysts employed in this process are primarily vanadium-based, supported on silica materials such as VOx/SiO2, VOx/MCM-41, and VOx/MCM-48. These catalysts show different degrees of VOx species polymerization, which affects their performance in the ODHP reaction.

A critical advantage of N2O is that it does not produce nonselective adsorbed oxygen species, which are formed from O2 and catalyze nonselective consecutive propene oxidation to COx. This contributes to the superior selectivity observed with N2O as an oxidant.

However, the study does not directly address the challenges associated with catalyst deactivation and stability in the N2O-ODHP process. To make N2O-ODHP a more feasible option for practical implementation, future research directions could focus on:

1. Developing catalysts with improved stability under N2O-ODHP conditions.
2. Investigating the long-term performance of VOx-based catalysts in N2O-ODHP to understand deactivation mechanisms.
3. Exploring novel support materials that can enhance the dispersion and stability of VOx species.
4. Optimizing reaction conditions to balance the slower reoxidation rate of N2O with overall process efficiency.
5. Studying the economic and environmental implications of using N2O as an oxidant on an industrial scale.

These strategies could help address the limitations of N2O-ODHP and potentially make it a more viable option for commercial propylene production.

在氧化脱氢丙烷（ODHP）反应中使用一氧化二氮（N2O）作为氧化剂相比其他氧化剂在丙烯选择性方面具有几个优势，特别是与氧气（O2）相比。

N2O重氧化还原态VOx物种的速度比O2慢，这导致在反应条件下VOx物种具有更高的还原程度。这种更高的还原程度对于获得高的初级丙烯选择性和抑制丙烯连续氧化成CO和CO2至关重要。

这个过程中使用的催化剂主要是基于钒的，负载在二氧化硅材料上，如VOx/SiO2、VOx/MCM-41和VOx/MCM-48。这些催化剂显示出不同程度的VOx物种聚合，这影响了它们在ODHP反应中的性能。

N2O的一个关键优势是它不会产生非选择性吸附氧物种，这些物种是由O2形成的，并且会催化非选择性的丙烯连续氧化成COx。这有助于使用N2O作为氧化剂时观察到的更高选择性。

然而，这项研究并未直接讨论N2O-ODHP过程中与催化剂失活和稳定性相关的挑战。为了使N2O-ODHP成为更可行的实际应用选择，未来的研究方向可以集中在：

1. 开发在N2O-ODHP条件下具有更好稳定性的催化剂。
2. 研究VOx基催化剂在N2O-ODHP中的长期性能，以了解失活机制。
3. 探索可以增强VOx物种分散性和稳定性的新型载体材料。
4. 优化反应条件，平衡N2O较慢的重氧化速率与整体过程效率。
5. 研究在工业规模上使用N2O作为氧化剂的经济和环境影响。

这些策略可以帮助解决N2O-ODHP的限制，并可能使其成为更可行的商业丙烯生产选择。
