          [1] "Superior performance of N2O as compared to O2 in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane over VOx/SiO2, VOx/MCM-41, and VOx/MCM-48"

[2] "N2O reoxidizes reduced VOx species slower than O2. This property of N2O is very essential for suppressing nonselective consecutive propene oxidation to COx (mainly to CO)."

[3] "Propene selectivity is higher with N2O than with O2 over a broad range of degrees of propane conversion. This effect is more pronounced for the sample possessing microcrystalline V2O5."

[4] "Two important improving effects of N2O on the ODP reaction should be especially emphasized: (1) a higher primary C3H6 selectivity (at near-to-zero degree of C3H8 conversion) is achieved and (2) lower activity for consecutive propene oxidation."

[5] "Besides influencing the reduction degree of VOx species, N2O does not produce nonselective adsorbed oxygen species (possibly of biatomic nature), which are formed from O2 and catalyze nonselective consecutive propene oxidation to COx."

[6] "It is clear from Figure 5 that there is no significant difference in the spectra of fully oxidized VOx species and VOx species having been reoxidized for 5 s in an O2 flow after C3H8 pretreatment. As compared to O2, reoxidation of reduced VOx species with N2O is slower, since these species are fully oxidized after ca. 30 s on steam in N2O."

[7] "Catalytic performance of differently structured VOx species supported over MCM-41, SiO2, and MCM-48 was determined using C3H8/O2/Ne = 40/20/40 and C3H8/N2O/Ne = 40/40/20 reaction mixtures."

[8] "It is concluded that the catalytic activity of the VOx(2.7)/MCM-41 catalyst is slightly higher than that of the VOx(2.8)/SiO2 and VOx(3.4)/MCM-48 samples. This may be due to a lower degree of polymerization of VOx species over the VOx(2.7)/MCM-41 catalyst as shown in section 3.1."

[9] "Irrespective of the structural difference of VOx species, the catalytic activity decreases when O2 is replaced by N2O."

[10] "Figure 2b clearly demonstrates that consecutive propene oxidation is strongly influenced by the nature of VOx species, too. The following order of catalyst ability for propene oxidation was found: VOx(11.2)/MCM-41 > VOx(2.8)/SiO2 > VOx(3.4)/MCM-48 > VOx(2.7)/MCM-41"

          Nitrous oxide (N2O) demonstrates superior performance compared to oxygen (O2) in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) over various vanadium-based catalysts (VOx/SiO2, VOx/MCM-41, and VOx/MCM-48). The advantages of using N2O as an oxidant include:

1. Higher propene selectivity: N2O provides higher propene selectivity over a broad range of propane conversion degrees compared to O2, especially for catalysts containing microcrystalline V2O5.

2. Improved primary C3H6 selectivity: N2O achieves higher primary C3H6 selectivity at near-zero propane conversion.

3. Reduced consecutive propene oxidation: N2O shows lower activity for consecutive propene oxidation to COx, preserving more of the desired product.

4. Slower reoxidation of reduced VOx species: N2O reoxidizes reduced VOx species more slowly than O2, which helps maintain the catalyst in a more reduced state and suppresses nonselective consecutive propene oxidation.

5. Absence of nonselective adsorbed oxygen species: Unlike O2, N2O does not produce nonselective adsorbed oxygen species that catalyze unwanted consecutive propene oxidation to COx.

The catalysts employed in this process are primarily vanadium-based catalysts supported on silica-based materials, such as VOx/SiO2, VOx/MCM-41, and VOx/MCM-48. The catalytic performance is influenced by the structure and degree of polymerization of VOx species. The VOx(2.7)/MCM-41 catalyst showed slightly higher activity compared to VOx(2.8)/SiO2 and VOx(3.4)/MCM-48, attributed to a lower degree of polymerization of VOx species.

It's worth noting that while N2O improves selectivity, it also decreases overall catalytic activity compared to O2. The nature of VOx species also influences consecutive propene oxidation, with the following order of catalyst ability for propene oxidation: VOx(11.2)/MCM-41 > VOx(2.8)/SiO2 > VOx(3.4)/MCM-48 > VOx(2.7)/MCM-41.

          与氧气（O2）相比，一氧化二氮（N2O）在各种钒基催化剂（VOx/SiO2、VOx/MCM-41和VOx/MCM-48）上进行的丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）反应中表现出优越的性能。使用N2O作为氧化剂的优势包括：

1. 更高的丙烯选择性：在广泛的丙烷转化度范围内，N2O提供了比O2更高的丙烯选择性，特别是对于含有微晶V2O5的催化剂。

2. 改善初级C3H6选择性：在接近零丙烷转化度时，N2O实现了更高的初级C3H6选择性。

3. 降低连续丙烯氧化：N2O对丙烯连续氧化成COx的活性较低，保留了更多的目标产物。

4. 还原态VOx物种的再氧化速度较慢：N2O对还原态VOx物种的再氧化速度比O2慢，这有助于保持催化剂处于更还原的状态，并抑制非选择性连续丙烯氧化。

5. 不产生非选择性吸附氧物种：与O2不同，N2O不产生会催化不需要的丙烯连续氧化成COx的非选择性吸附氧物种。

该过程中使用的催化剂主要是基于硅基材料支撑的钒基催化剂，如VOx/SiO2、VOx/MCM-41和VOx/MCM-48。催化性能受VOx物种的结构和聚合度的影响。VOx(2.7)/MCM-41催化剂显示出略高于VOx(2.8)/SiO2和VOx(3.4)/MCM-48的活性，这归因于VOx物种较低的聚合度。

值得注意的是，虽然N2O提高了选择性，但与O2相比也降低了整体催化活性。VOx物种的性质也影响连续丙烯氧化，催化剂对丙烯氧化能力的顺序如下：VOx(11.2)/MCM-41 > VOx(2.8)/SiO2 > VOx(3.4)/MCM-48 > VOx(2.7)/MCM-41。

          [1] "Combining the results of in-situ UV/vis analysis and transient isotopic experiments with catalytic data, two important conclusions about the role of O2 and N2O in the ODP reaction were derived: (1) the ability of oxidant for reoxidation of reduced VOx species and (2) the nature of selective and nonselective oxygen species."

[2] "Besides influencing the reduction degree of VOx species, N2O does not produce nonselective adsorbed oxygen species (possibly of biatomic nature), which are formed from O2 and catalyze nonselective consecutive propene oxidation to COx."

[3] "The in-situ UV/vis spectroscopy evidenced a higher degree of reduction of VOx species under C3H8N2O than C3H8O2 conditions. By using this method in a transient mode, the ability of O2 and N2O for reoxidation of reduced VOx species was experimentally distinguished; N2O reoxidizes reduced VOx species slower than O2."

[4] "Since transient responses of carbon oxides contain both labeled (18O) and nonlabeled (16O) oxygen species (Figure 7), two independent reaction pathways in COx formation can be suggested: (1) with participation of labeled (adsorbed) and (2) nonlabeled (lattice) oxygen."
