[1] "Superior performance of N2O as compared to O2 in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane over VOx/SiO2, VOx/MCM-41, and VOx/MCM-48"

[2] "N2O reoxidizes reduced VOx species slower than O2. This property of N2O is very essential for suppressing nonselective consecutive propene oxidation to COx (mainly to CO)."

[3] "Propene selectivity is higher with N2O than with O2 over a broad range of degrees of propane conversion. This effect is more pronounced for the sample possessing microcrystalline V2O5."

[4] "Two important improving effects of N2O on the ODP reaction should be especially emphasized: (1) a higher primary C3H6 selectivity (at near-to-zero degree of C3H8 conversion) is achieved and (2) lower activity for consecutive propene oxidation."

[5] "Besides influencing the reduction degree of VOx species, N2O does not produce nonselective adsorbed oxygen species (possibly of biatomic nature), which are formed from O2 and catalyze nonselective consecutive propene oxidation to COx."

The use of nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) offers several advantages in terms of propylene selectivity compared to other oxidants, particularly oxygen (O2):

1. Higher propylene selectivity: N2O provides higher propylene selectivity across a wide range of propane conversion levels compared to O2. This is especially noticeable for catalysts containing microcrystalline V2O5.

2. Suppression of consecutive oxidation: N2O reoxidizes reduced VOx species more slowly than O2, which is crucial for suppressing the nonselective consecutive oxidation of propene to COx (mainly CO).

3. Higher primary propylene selectivity: N2O achieves higher primary C3H6 selectivity at near-zero propane conversion levels.

4. Lower activity for consecutive propene oxidation: This further contributes to improved overall propylene selectivity.

5. Absence of nonselective adsorbed oxygen species: Unlike O2, N2O does not produce nonselective adsorbed oxygen species that can catalyze the unwanted consecutive oxidation of propene to COx.

The catalysts employed in this process include VOx/SiO2, VOx/MCM-41, and VOx/MCM-48. These catalysts contain vanadium oxide species supported on different silica-based materials.

The literature does not directly address the critical challenges associated with catalyst deactivation and stability in N2O-ODHP. However, based on the information provided, some potential challenges and research directions can be inferred:

1. Optimizing catalyst formulation: Further research into the optimal support materials and vanadium loading to maximize propylene selectivity and catalyst stability.

2. Understanding the nature of oxygen species: More detailed studies on the nature of oxygen species formed from N2O and their role in the reaction mechanism.

3. Improving N2O activation: Developing catalysts that can more effectively activate N2O while maintaining its selective oxidation properties.

4. Long-term stability studies: Investigating the long-term stability of catalysts under N2O-ODHP conditions to address potential deactivation issues.

5. Process optimization: Exploring optimal reaction conditions (temperature, pressure, feed composition) to balance selectivity, conversion, and catalyst stability.

6. In-situ characterization: Utilizing advanced in-situ characterization techniques to better understand the dynamic behavior of catalysts under reaction conditions.

7. Theoretical studies: Employing computational methods to gain deeper insights into the reaction mechanism and guide catalyst design.

By addressing these challenges and pursuing these research directions, the N2O-ODHP process could potentially become a more feasible option for practical implementation in propylene production.

在丙烷氧化脱氢(ODHP)过程中使用一氧化二氮(N2O)作为氧化剂相比其他氧化剂在丙烯选择性方面有几个优势，特别是与氧气(O2)相比：

1. 更高的丙烯选择性：在广泛的丙烷转化水平范围内，N2O提供了比O2更高的丙烯选择性。这在含有微晶V2O5的催化剂上尤为明显。

2. 抑制连续氧化：N2O重新氧化还原的VOx物种的速度比O2慢，这对抑制丙烯非选择性连续氧化成COx（主要是CO）至关重要。

3. 更高的初级丙烯选择性：在接近零丙烷转化水平时，N2O能够实现更高的初级C3H6选择性。

4. 对连续丙烯氧化的活性较低：这进一步提高了整体丙烯选择性。

5. 没有非选择性吸附氧物种：与O2不同，N2O不会产生可能催化丙烯非期望连续氧化成COx的非选择性吸附氧物种。

这个过程中使用的催化剂包括VOx/SiO2、VOx/MCM-41和VOx/MCM-48。这些催化剂含有负载在不同硅基材料上的氧化钒物种。

文献并未直接讨论N2O-ODHP中与催化剂失活和稳定性相关的关键挑战。然而，基于提供的信息，可以推断出一些潜在的挑战和研究方向：

1. 优化催化剂配方：进一步研究最佳载体材料和钒负载量，以最大化丙烯选择性和催化剂稳定性。

2. 理解氧物种的性质：对N2O形成的氧物种的性质及其在反应机理中的作用进行更详细的研究。

3. 改善N2O活化：开发能更有效活化N2O同时保持其选择性氧化性质的催化剂。

4. 长期稳定性研究：研究催化剂在N2O-ODHP条件下的长期稳定性，以解决潜在的失活问题。

5. 工艺优化：探索最佳反应条件（温度、压力、进料组成），以平衡选择性、转化率和催化剂稳定性。

6. 原位表征：利用先进的原位表征技术更好地理解催化剂在反应条件下的动态行为。

7. 理论研究：采用计算方法深入了解反应机理，指导催化剂设计。

通过解决这些挑战并追求这些研究方向，N2O-ODHP过程有可能成为丙烯生产中更可行的实际实施选择。
