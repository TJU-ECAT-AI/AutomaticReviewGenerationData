[1] "It is concluded that the catalytic activity of the VOx(2.7)/MCM-41 catalyst is slightly higher than that of the VOx(2.8)/SiO2 and VOx(3.4)/MCM-48 samples. This may be due to a lower degree of polymerization of VOx species over the VOx(2.7)/MCM-41 catalyst as shown in section 3.1."

[2] "Irrespective of the structural difference of VOx species, the catalytic activity decreases when O2 is replaced by N2O."

[3] "Figure 2b clearly demonstrates that consecutive propene oxidation is strongly influenced by the nature of VOx species, too. The following order of catalyst ability for propene oxidation was found: VOx(11.2)/MCM-41 > VOx(2.8)/SiO2 > VOx(3.4)/MCM-48 > VOx(2.7)/MCM-41"

[4] "Two important improving effects of N2O on the ODP reaction should be especially emphasized: (1) a higher primary C3H6 selectivity (at near-to-zero degree of C3H8 conversion) is achieved and (2) lower activity for consecutive propene oxidation."

[5] "Combining the results of in-situ UV/vis analysis and transient isotopic experiments with catalytic data, two important conclusions about the role of O2 and N2O in the ODP reaction were derived: (1) the ability of oxidant for reoxidation of reduced VOx species and (2) the nature of selective and nonselective oxygen species."

[6] "Besides influencing the reduction degree of VOx species, N2O does not produce nonselective adsorbed oxygen species (possibly of biatomic nature), which are formed from O2 and catalyze nonselective consecutive propene oxidation to COx."

The use of nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) offers several advantages in terms of propylene selectivity compared to other oxidants, particularly oxygen (O2). 

N2O demonstrates superior performance in ODHP due to two main factors:

1. Higher primary propylene selectivity: N2O achieves higher initial propylene selectivity at low propane conversion levels compared to O2.

2. Lower consecutive propene oxidation: N2O exhibits reduced activity for the undesirable consecutive oxidation of propene to carbon oxides (COx).

Various catalysts have been employed in this process, including VOx/SiO2, VOx/MCM-41, and VOx/MCM-48. The catalytic activity and selectivity are influenced by the nature and degree of polymerization of the VOx species. The VOx(2.7)/MCM-41 catalyst showed slightly higher activity compared to VOx(2.8)/SiO2 and VOx(3.4)/MCM-48, attributed to a lower degree of polymerization of VOx species.

The critical challenges associated with catalyst deactivation and stability are not directly addressed in the given literature. However, the study focuses on understanding the mechanistic aspects and the role of the oxidant in the ODHP process.

To address limitations and potentially make N2O-ODHP more feasible for practical implementation, the following strategies or research directions could be proposed:

1. Catalyst optimization: Further research into optimizing the catalyst composition and structure to enhance the positive effects of N2O while maintaining high activity.

2. Mechanistic studies: Continue investigating the reaction mechanisms, particularly the role of lattice oxygen and adsorbed oxygen species, to design more efficient catalysts.

3. Process engineering: Develop innovative reactor designs or process configurations that can maximize the benefits of using N2O as an oxidant while addressing any potential drawbacks.

4. Economic and environmental assessment: Conduct comprehensive studies on the economic viability and environmental impact of using N2O in large-scale ODHP processes.

5. Hybrid systems: Explore the potential of combining N2O with other oxidants or process conditions to achieve an optimal balance between selectivity and activity.

6. In-situ characterization: Utilize advanced in-situ characterization techniques to gain deeper insights into the catalyst behavior under reaction conditions, which can guide further improvements.

These strategies aim to leverage the advantages of N2O in ODHP while addressing potential limitations, ultimately working towards making N2O-ODHP a more viable option for industrial implementation.

在氧化脱氢丙烷（ODHP）反应中使用一氧化二氮（N2O）作为氧化剂与其他氧化剂相比，在丙烯选择性方面具有几个优势，特别是与氧气（O2）相比。

N2O在ODHP中表现出优异的性能，主要归因于两个因素：

1. 更高的初始丙烯选择性：在低丙烷转化率水平下，N2O比O2能够实现更高的初始丙烯选择性。

2. 较低的连续丙烯氧化：N2O对不期望的丙烯连续氧化成一氧化碳（COx）的活性较低。

在这个过程中使用了各种催化剂，包括VOx/SiO2、VOx/MCM-41和VOx/MCM-48。催化活性和选择性受VOx物种的性质和聚合度的影响。VOx(2.7)/MCM-41催化剂显示出略高于VOx(2.8)/SiO2和VOx(3.4)/MCM-48的活性，这归因于VOx物种较低的聚合度。

给定的文献中没有直接讨论与催化剂失活和稳定性相关的关键挑战。然而，该研究重点关注了理解ODHP过程中氧化剂的机理方面和作用。

为了解决限制并可能使N2O-ODHP更适合实际应用，可以提出以下策略或研究方向：

1. 催化剂优化：进一步研究优化催化剂组成和结构，以增强N2O的正面效果，同时保持高活性。

2. 机理研究：继续研究反应机理，特别是晶格氧和吸附氧物种的作用，以设计更高效的催化剂。

3. 过程工程：开发创新的反应器设计或工艺配置，以最大化使用N2O作为氧化剂的优势，同时解决可能的缺点。

4. 经济和环境评估：对大规模ODHP过程中使用N2O的经济可行性和环境影响进行全面研究。

5. 混合系统：探索将N2O与其他氧化剂或工艺条件结合的潜力，以实现选择性和活性之间的最佳平衡。

6. 原位表征：利用先进的原位表征技术，深入了解催化剂在反应条件下的行为，这可以指导进一步的改进。

这些策略旨在利用N2O在ODHP中的优势，同时解决潜在的限制，最终致力于使N2O-ODHP成为更可行的工业实施选择。
