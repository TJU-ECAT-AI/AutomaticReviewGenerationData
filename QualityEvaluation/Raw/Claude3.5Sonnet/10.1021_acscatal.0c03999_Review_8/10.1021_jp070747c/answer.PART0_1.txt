[1] "Catalytic performance of differently structured VOx species supported over MCM-41, SiO2, and MCM-48 was determined using C3H8/O2/Ne = 40/20/40 and C3H8/N2O/Ne = 40/40/20 reaction mixtures."

[2] "Irrespective of the structural difference of VOx species, the catalytic activity decreases when O2 is replaced by N2O."

[3] "Figure 2 clearly demonstrates that consecutive propene oxidation is strongly influenced by the nature of VOx species, too."

[4] "Two important improving effects of N2O on the ODP reaction should be especially emphasized: (1) a higher primary C3H6 selectivity (at near-to-zero degree of C3H8 conversion) is achieved and (2) lower activity for consecutive propene oxidation."

[5] "Combining the results of in-situ UV/vis analysis and transient isotopic experiments with catalytic data, two important conclusions about the role of O2 and N2O in the ODP reaction were derived: (1) the ability of oxidant for reoxidation of reduced VOx species and (2) the nature of selective and nonselective oxygen species."

[6] "Besides influencing the reduction degree of VOx species, N2O does not produce nonselective adsorbed oxygen species (possibly of biatomic nature), which are formed from O2 and catalyze nonselective consecutive propene oxidation to COx."

The use of nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) offers several advantages in terms of propylene selectivity compared to other oxidants, particularly oxygen (O2). The main benefits of using N2O include:

1. Higher primary propylene selectivity: N2O provides a higher initial selectivity towards propylene, especially at low propane conversion levels.

2. Lower consecutive oxidation: N2O exhibits lower activity for the consecutive oxidation of propylene to carbon oxides (COx), which helps maintain higher propylene yields.

3. Controlled oxidation state: N2O leads to a higher degree of reduction of VOx species, which is beneficial for propylene selectivity.

4. Selective oxygen species: N2O does not produce nonselective adsorbed oxygen species, which are responsible for undesired propylene oxidation to COx when using O2.

The catalysts employed in this process are primarily vanadium-based catalysts supported on various silica materials, including MCM-41, MCM-48, and SiO2. The structure and dispersion of VOx species on these supports play a crucial role in determining catalyst performance.

Critical challenges associated with catalyst deactivation and stability in N2O-ODHP are not explicitly discussed in the given literature. However, based on the information provided, some potential challenges and research directions can be inferred:

1. Catalyst activity: While N2O improves selectivity, it also decreases overall catalytic activity compared to O2. Research should focus on improving catalyst formulations to enhance activity while maintaining high selectivity.

2. Catalyst structure optimization: Further studies on the relationship between VOx species structure and catalytic performance could lead to more efficient catalyst designs.

3. Reaction kinetics: In-depth investigation of reaction mechanisms and kinetics using N2O could help optimize reaction conditions and catalyst compositions.

4. Support material engineering: Developing novel support materials or modifying existing ones to better stabilize and disperse VOx species could improve catalyst performance and longevity.

5. Oxidant activation: Research into methods to enhance N2O activation without compromising its selectivity benefits could lead to improved overall process efficiency.

6. Process design: Exploring innovative reactor designs or operation modes (e.g., cyclic operation) that capitalize on the unique properties of N2O as an oxidant could further improve process performance.

By addressing these challenges and pursuing these research directions, N2O-ODHP could potentially become a more feasible option for practical implementation in propylene production.

在丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）过程中使用一氧化二氮（N2O）作为氧化剂与其他氧化剂相比，在丙烯选择性方面具有几个优势，特别是与氧气（O2）相比。使用N2O的主要优势包括：

1. 更高的初级丙烯选择性：N2O在低丙烷转化率下提供更高的初始丙烯选择性。

2. 较低的连续氧化：N2O对丙烯连续氧化生成碳氧化物（COx）的活性较低，有助于保持较高的丙烯产率。

3. 可控的氧化态：N2O导致VOx物种具有更高的还原度，这有利于丙烯选择性。

4. 选择性氧物种：N2O不产生非选择性吸附氧物种，而这些物种在使用O2时会导致丙烯不期望的氧化生成COx。

该过程中使用的催化剂主要是负载在各种硅基材料上的钒基催化剂，包括MCM-41、MCM-48和SiO2。VOx物种在这些载体上的结构和分散度对催化剂性能起着关键作用。

文献中没有明确讨论N2O-ODHP中与催化剂失活和稳定性相关的关键挑战。但根据提供的信息，可以推断一些潜在的挑战和研究方向：

1. 催化剂活性：虽然N2O提高了选择性，但与O2相比也降低了整体催化活性。研究应集中于改进催化剂配方，以提高活性同时保持高选择性。

2. 催化剂结构优化：对VOx物种结构与催化性能关系的进一步研究可能会导致更高效的催化剂设计。

3. 反应动力学：对使用N2O的反应机理和动力学进行深入研究，有助于优化反应条件和催化剂组成。

4. 载体材料工程：开发新型载体材料或改进现有材料以更好地稳定和分散VOx物种，可以提高催化剂性能和寿命。

5. 氧化剂活化：研究提高N2O活化的方法，同时不损害其选择性优势，可以提高整体过程效率。

6. 工艺设计：探索创新的反应器设计或操作模式（如循环操作），充分利用N2O作为氧化剂的独特性质，可以进一步提高工艺性能。

通过解决这些挑战并追求这些研究方向，N2O-ODHP可能成为丙烯生产中更可行的实际应用选择。
