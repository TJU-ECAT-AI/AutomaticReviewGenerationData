[1] "Figure 1b illustrates selectivityconversion relationships in the ODP reaction over differently structured VOx species using N2O. As in the presence of O2 (Figure 1a), propene selectivity decreases with an increase in propane conversion with N2O, too. However, from the comparison of the results in Figure 1a and b, it is obvious that propene selectivity is higher with N2O than with O2 over a broad range of degrees of propane conversion."

[2] "Two important improving effects of N2O on the ODP reaction should be especially emphasized: (1) a higher primary C3H6 selectivity (at near-to-zero degree of C3H8 conversion) is achieved and (2) lower activity for consecutive propene oxidation."

[3] "The in-situ UV/vis spectroscopy evidenced a higher degree of reduction of VOx species under C3H8N2O than C3H8O2 conditions. By using this method in a transient mode, the ability of O2 and N2O for reoxidation of reduced VOx species was experimentally distinguished; N2O reoxidizes reduced VOx species slower than O2."

[4] "Besides influencing the reduction degree of VOx species, N2O does not produce nonselective adsorbed oxygen species (possibly of biatomic nature), which are formed from O2 and catalyze nonselective consecutive propene oxidation to COx."

The use of nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) offers several advantages in terms of propylene selectivity compared to other oxidants, particularly oxygen (O2):

1. Higher propene selectivity: N2O provides higher propene selectivity over a broad range of propane conversion degrees compared to O2.

2. Improved primary C3H6 selectivity: N2O achieves higher primary C3H6 selectivity at near-zero propane conversion.

3. Reduced consecutive propene oxidation: N2O shows lower activity for consecutive propene oxidation to COx, preserving more of the desired product.

4. Higher reduction degree of VOx species: The use of N2O results in a higher degree of reduction of VOx species compared to O2, which contributes to improved selectivity.

5. Slower reoxidation of reduced VOx species: N2O reoxidizes reduced VOx species more slowly than O2, which helps maintain the catalyst in a more reduced state.

6. Absence of nonselective adsorbed oxygen species: Unlike O2, N2O does not produce nonselective adsorbed oxygen species that catalyze unwanted consecutive propene oxidation to COx.

The catalysts employed in this process are primarily vanadium-based catalysts supported on silica-based materials, such as VOx/SiO2, VOx/MCM-41, and VOx/MCM-48. These catalysts have shown promising results in N2O-ODHP reactions.

Critical challenges associated with catalyst deactivation and stability are not explicitly discussed in the given literature. However, based on the information provided, some potential challenges and research directions can be inferred:

1. Optimizing catalyst composition: Further research into the optimal vanadium loading and support material composition could enhance catalyst performance and stability.

2. Investigating catalyst regeneration methods: Developing efficient methods to regenerate the catalyst and maintain its activity over extended periods of use.

3. Studying the long-term effects of N2O use: Investigating the impact of prolonged N2O exposure on catalyst structure and activity.

4. Exploring novel support materials: Investigating new support materials that could further enhance the stability and selectivity of vanadium-based catalysts.

5. Mechanism elucidation: Conducting more in-depth studies to fully understand the reaction mechanism and the role of N2O in improving selectivity.

6. Process optimization: Developing optimal reaction conditions (temperature, pressure, feed composition) to maximize propylene yield while maintaining catalyst stability.

7. Scaling up studies: Investigating the feasibility of scaling up N2O-ODHP processes for industrial applications.

By addressing these challenges and pursuing these research directions, the N2O-ODHP process could potentially become a more viable option for practical implementation in propylene production.

一氧化二氮（N2O）作为丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）反应的氧化剂，相比其他氧化剂（尤其是氧气O2）在丙烯选择性方面具有以下优势：

1. 更高的丙烯选择性：在广泛的丙烷转化度范围内，N2O提供了比O2更高的丙烯选择性。

2. 改善初级C3H6选择性：在接近零丙烷转化度时，N2O实现了更高的初级C3H6选择性。

3. 降低连续丙烯氧化：N2O对丙烯连续氧化成COx的活性较低，保留了更多的目标产物。

4. VOx物种的更高还原度：使用N2O导致VOx物种的还原度比使用O2时更高，这有助于提高选择性。

5. 还原态VOx物种的再氧化速度较慢：N2O对还原态VOx物种的再氧化速度比O2慢，这有助于保持催化剂处于更还原的状态。

6. 不产生非选择性吸附氧物种：与O2不同，N2O不产生会催化不需要的丙烯连续氧化成COx的非选择性吸附氧物种。

该过程中使用的催化剂主要是基于硅基材料支撑的钒基催化剂，如VOx/SiO2、VOx/MCM-41和VOx/MCM-48。这些催化剂在N2O-ODHP反应中显示出了良好的效果。

虽然文献中没有明确讨论与催化剂失活和稳定性相关的关键挑战，但根据提供的信息，可以推断出一些潜在的挑战和研究方向：

1. 优化催化剂组成：进一步研究最佳的钒负载量和支撑材料组成，以提高催化剂性能和稳定性。

2. 研究催化剂再生方法：开发高效的方法来再生催化剂并在长期使用中保持其活性。

3. 研究N2O长期使用的影响：调查长期暴露在N2O环境中对催化剂结构和活性的影响。

4. 探索新型支撑材料：研究新的支撑材料，进一步提高钒基催化剂的稳定性和选择性。

5. 机理阐明：开展更深入的研究，以充分理解反应机理和N2O在提高选择性中的作用。

6. 工艺优化：开发最佳反应条件（温度、压力、进料组成），以在保持催化剂稳定性的同时最大化丙烯产率。

7. 放大研究：研究N2O-ODHP工艺在工业应用中的可行性。

通过解决这些挑战并追求这些研究方向，N2O-ODHP工艺有望成为丙烯生产中更可行的实际应用选择。
