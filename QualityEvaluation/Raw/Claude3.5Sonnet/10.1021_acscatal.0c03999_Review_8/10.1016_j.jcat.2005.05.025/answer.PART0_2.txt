[1] "For all of the V/MCM-41 catalysts used in this study, higher propene selectivity is achieved with N2O as compared with O2 at similar degrees of C3H8 conversion."

[2] "The catalytic activity is lower, however, in the presence of N2O as compared with O2 because of the weaker oxidizing potential of N2O relative to O2 for the re-oxidation of the reduced surface VOx sites during the ODP reaction."

[3] "There is no significant difference in propene selectivity between highly dispersed surface VOx species and crystalline V2O5 nanoparticles when N2O is used as an oxidant. In contrast to highly dispersed VOx on the surface of MCM-41, the crystalline V2O5 nanoparticles are not selective for the ODP reaction in the presence of O2."

[4] "The positive effect of N2O is related to the inhibition of direct C3H8 oxidation and the consecutive oxidation of C3H6 to COx. The inhibition is ascribed to reducing surface density (spatial separation) of active surface lattice oxygen in VOx species, since N2O is a weaker oxidant for re-oxidation of reduced VOx species as compared with O2."

[5] "From a stoichiometric point of view of the ODP reaction, selective propene formation is favored over combustion reactions at lower surface densities."

The use of nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) offers several advantages in terms of propylene selectivity compared to other oxidants, particularly oxygen (O2):

1. Higher propene selectivity: N2O consistently achieves higher propene selectivity compared to O2 at similar degrees of propane conversion across various V/MCM-41 catalysts.

2. Inhibition of undesired reactions: N2O inhibits direct propane oxidation and consecutive oxidation of propene to COx, leading to improved selectivity.

3. Lower surface density of active oxygen: N2O's weaker oxidizing potential results in a lower surface density of active lattice oxygen, which favors selective propene formation over combustion reactions.

4. Improved performance with crystalline V2O5: Unlike O2, N2O maintains high propene selectivity even with crystalline V2O5 nanoparticles, which are typically not selective with O2.

The catalysts employed in this process include various V/MCM-41 materials with different vanadium loadings. These catalysts consist of highly dispersed surface VOx species (monomeric and small surface VOx clusters) at lower vanadium loadings, and crystalline V2O5 nanoparticles at higher loadings (e.g., 11.2 wt%).

Critical challenges associated with N2O-ODHP include:

1. Lower catalytic activity: The use of N2O results in lower overall catalytic activity compared to O2 due to its weaker oxidizing potential for re-oxidizing reduced surface VOx sites.

2. Catalyst stability: While not explicitly mentioned in the provided literature, catalyst deactivation and stability are common concerns in ODHP processes and likely apply to N2O-ODHP as well.

To address these limitations and make N2O-ODHP more feasible for practical implementation, the following strategies and research directions could be pursued:

1. Catalyst optimization: Develop catalysts that can maintain high propene selectivity while improving overall activity with N2O. This may involve exploring novel support materials or modifying existing V/MCM-41 catalysts.

2. Process intensification: Investigate methods to enhance the reaction rate and overall efficiency of N2O-ODHP, such as optimizing reactor design or exploring novel reaction engineering approaches.

3. N2O activation: Research ways to activate N2O more effectively for catalyst re-oxidation without compromising its selectivity advantages.

4. Hybrid oxidant systems: Explore the use of N2O in combination with other oxidants to balance activity and selectivity.

5. Long-term stability studies: Conduct extensive research on catalyst stability and deactivation mechanisms in N2O-ODHP to develop strategies for improving catalyst longevity.

6. Economic and environmental assessment: Perform comprehensive techno-economic and life cycle analyses to evaluate the feasibility of N2O-ODHP compared to conventional processes and identify areas for improvement.

By addressing these challenges and pursuing these research directions, N2O-ODHP could potentially become a more viable option for industrial-scale propylene production.

一氧化二氮（N2O）作为氧化剂在丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）中的使用在丙烯选择性方面相比其他氧化剂具有几个优势：

1. 更高的丙烯选择性：在相似的丙烷转化程度下，N2O在各种V/MCM-41催化剂上始终实现比O2更高的丙烯选择性。

2. 抑制不需要的反应：N2O抑制直接丙烷氧化和丙烯连续氧化为COx的反应，从而提高选择性。

3. 活性氧表面密度更低：N2O较弱的氧化能力导致活性晶格氧的表面密度较低，这有利于选择性丙烯形成而非燃烧反应。

4. 改善结晶V2O5的性能：与O2不同，N2O即使在结晶V2O5纳米颗粒上也能保持高丙烯选择性，而这些纳米颗粒在O2存在下通常不具有选择性。

这个过程中使用的催化剂包括具有不同钒负载量的各种V/MCM-41材料。这些催化剂在较低钒负载量时由高度分散的表面VOx物种（单体和小型表面VOx簇）组成，在较高负载量（如11.2 wt%）时形成结晶V2O5纳米颗粒。

N2O-ODHP相关的关键挑战包括：

1. 较低的催化活性：由于N2O在重新氧化还原表面VOx位点方面具有较弱的氧化能力，使用N2O会导致整体催化活性较低。

2. 催化剂稳定性：虽然在提供的文献中没有明确提及，但催化剂失活和稳定性是ODHP过程中常见的问题，很可能也适用于N2O-ODHP。

为了解决这些限制并使N2O-ODHP更适合实际应用，可以采取以下策略和研究方向：

1. 催化剂优化：开发能够在使用N2O时保持高丙烯选择性同时提高整体活性的催化剂。这可能涉及探索新型支撑材料或改进现有V/MCM-41催化剂。

2. 过程强化：研究提高N2O-ODHP反应速率和整体效率的方法，如优化反应器设计或探索新型反应工程方法。

3. N2O活化：研究更有效地活化N2O用于催化剂再氧化的方法，同时不影响其选择性优势。

4. 混合氧化剂系统：探索将N2O与其他氧化剂结合使用，以平衡活性和选择性。

5. 长期稳定性研究：对N2O-ODHP中的催化剂稳定性和失活机理进行广泛研究，以制定提高催化剂寿命的策略。

6. 经济和环境评估：进行全面的技术经济和生命周期分析，评估N2O-ODHP与传统工艺相比的可行性，并确定需要改进的领域。

通过解决这些挑战并推进这些研究方向，N2O-ODHP可能成为工业规模丙烯生产的更可行选择。
