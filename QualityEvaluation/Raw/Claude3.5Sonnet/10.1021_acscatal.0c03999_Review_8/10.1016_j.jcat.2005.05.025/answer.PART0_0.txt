[1] "For all of the V/MCM-41 catalysts used in this study, higher propene selectivity is achieved with N2O as compared with O2 at similar degrees of C3H8 conversion."

[2] "The catalytic activity is lower, however, in the presence of N2O as compared with O2 because of the weaker oxidizing potential of N2O relative to O2 for the re-oxidation of the reduced surface VOx sites during the ODP reaction."

[3] "The positive effect of N2O is related to the inhibition of direct C3H8 oxidation and the consecutive oxidation of C3H6 to COx. The inhibition is ascribed to reducing surface density (spatial separation) of active surface lattice oxygen in VOx species, since N2O is a weaker oxidant for re-oxidation of reduced VOx species as compared with O2."

[4] "From a stoichiometric point of view of the ODP reaction, selective propene formation is favored over combustion reactions at lower surface densities."

[5] "Highly dispersed VOx species, which can be classified as monomeric and small two-dimensional VOx aggregates, are present in materials with a vanadium loading of up to 5.3 wt% under conditions of the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODP) and are independent of the preparation method."

[6] "There is no significant difference in propene selectivity between highly dispersed surface VOx species and crystalline V2O5 nanoparticles when N2O is used as an oxidant. In contrast to highly dispersed VOx on the surface of MCM-41, the crystalline V2O5 nanoparticles are not selective for the ODP reaction in the presence of O2."

The use of nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) offers several advantages in terms of propylene selectivity compared to other oxidants, particularly oxygen (O2):

1. Higher propene selectivity: N2O consistently provides higher propene selectivity compared to O2 at similar propane conversion levels across various V/MCM-41 catalysts.

2. Inhibition of undesired reactions: N2O inhibits direct propane oxidation and consecutive oxidation of propene to COx, leading to improved selectivity.

3. Lower surface density of active oxygen: N2O's weaker oxidizing potential results in a lower surface density of active lattice oxygen, which favors selective propene formation over combustion reactions.

4. Improved performance with crystalline V2O5: When using N2O, there is no significant difference in propene selectivity between highly dispersed surface VOx species and crystalline V2O5 nanoparticles, whereas V2O5 nanoparticles are not selective with O2.

The main catalysts employed in this process are vanadium-based catalysts supported on mesoporous materials, particularly V/MCM-41. These catalysts contain highly dispersed VOx species, classified as monomeric and small two-dimensional VOx aggregates, with vanadium loadings up to 5.3 wt%.

Critical challenges associated with catalyst deactivation and stability are not explicitly discussed in the given literature. However, some potential challenges can be inferred:

1. Lower catalytic activity: The use of N2O results in lower catalytic activity compared to O2 due to its weaker oxidizing potential, which may impact overall process efficiency.

2. Potential for catalyst reduction: The slower re-oxidation of reduced VOx species by N2O might lead to gradual catalyst deactivation over time.

To address these limitations and make N2O-ODHP more feasible for practical implementation, the following strategies or research directions could be pursued:

1. Catalyst optimization: Develop catalysts that maintain high dispersion of VOx species while improving their resistance to reduction and deactivation.

2. Mixed oxidant systems: Investigate the use of N2O in combination with small amounts of O2 to balance selectivity and activity.

3. Process engineering: Design reactor systems that optimize the contact time and temperature to maximize propene yield while minimizing catalyst deactivation.

4. In-situ regeneration: Develop methods for periodic catalyst regeneration without requiring reactor shutdown.

5. Alternative support materials: Explore other mesoporous supports or modify MCM-41 to enhance catalyst stability and activity while maintaining the benefits of N2O as an oxidant.

6. Mechanistic studies: Conduct further research to better understand the reaction mechanisms and the role of different oxygen species in the ODHP process, which could lead to more targeted catalyst designs.

7. Economic and environmental assessment: Evaluate the overall feasibility of N2O-ODHP, considering factors such as N2O production, process economics, and environmental impact compared to conventional propene production methods.

在丙烷氧化脱氢(ODHP)中使用一氧化二氮(N2O)作为氧化剂与其他氧化剂相比，在丙烯选择性方面具有以下几个优势：

1. 更高的丙烯选择性：在相似的丙烷转化水平下，N2O在各种V/MCM-41催化剂上始终提供比O2更高的丙烯选择性。

2. 抑制不良反应：N2O抑制直接丙烷氧化和丙烯连续氧化为COx的反应，从而提高选择性。

3. 活性氧表面密度较低：N2O较弱的氧化能力导致活性晶格氧的表面密度较低，这有利于选择性丙烯生成而非燃烧反应。

4. 改善结晶V2O5的性能：使用N2O时，高度分散的表面VOx物种和结晶V2O5纳米粒子之间的丙烯选择性没有显著差异，而使用O2时V2O5纳米粒子则不具选择性。

这一过程中主要使用的催化剂是负载在介孔材料上的钒基催化剂，特别是V/MCM-41。这些催化剂含有高度分散的VOx物种，可分类为单体和小型二维VOx聚集体，钒含量最高可达5.3 wt%。

文献中没有明确讨论与催化剂失活和稳定性相关的关键挑战。然而，可以推断出一些潜在的挑战：

1. 较低的催化活性：由于N2O的氧化能力较弱，其使用导致催化活性较低，可能影响整体工艺效率。

2. 催化剂还原的可能性：N2O对还原态VOx物种的再氧化速度较慢，可能导致催化剂随时间逐渐失活。

为解决这些限制并使N2O-ODHP更适合实际应用，可以采取以下策略或研究方向：

1. 催化剂优化：开发能保持VOx物种高度分散的同时提高其抗还原和抗失活能力的催化剂。

2. 混合氧化剂系统：研究将N2O与少量O2结合使用，以平衡选择性和活性。

3. 工艺工程：设计反应器系统，优化接触时间和温度，以最大化丙烯产率，同时最小化催化剂失活。

4. 原位再生：开发无需反应器停机的定期催化剂再生方法。

5. 替代载体材料：探索其他介孔载体或改性MCM-41，以提高催化剂稳定性和活性，同时保持N2O作为氧化剂的优势。

6. 机理研究：进行进一步研究，以更好地理解ODHP过程中的反应机理和不同氧物种的作用，这可能导致更有针对性的催化剂设计。

7. 经济和环境评估：评估N2O-ODHP的整体可行性，考虑N2O生产、工艺经济性以及与传统丙烯生产方法相比的环境影响等因素。
