          [1] "For all of the V/MCM-41 catalysts used in this study, higher propene selectivity is achieved with N2O as compared with O2 at similar degrees of C3H8 conversion."

[2] "The catalytic activity is lower, however, in the presence of N2O as compared with O2 because of the weaker oxidizing potential of N2O relative to O2 for the re-oxidation of the reduced surface VOx sites during the ODP reaction."

[3] "The positive effect of N2O is related to the inhibition of direct C3H8 oxidation and the consecutive oxidation of C3H6 to COx. The inhibition is ascribed to reducing surface density (spatial separation) of active surface lattice oxygen in VOx species, since N2O is a weaker oxidant for re-oxidation of reduced VOx species as compared with O2."

[4] "From a stoichiometric point of view of the ODP reaction, selective propene formation is favored over combustion reactions at lower surface densities."

[5] "There is no significant difference in propene selectivity between highly dispersed surface VOx species and crystalline V2O5 nanoparticles when N2O is used as an oxidant. In contrast to highly dispersed VOx on the surface of MCM-41, the crystalline V2O5 nanoparticles are not selective for the ODP reaction in the presence of O2."

[6] "Highly dispersed VOx species, which can be classified as monomeric and small two-dimensional VOx aggregates, are present in materials with a vanadium loading of up to 5.3 wt% under conditions of the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODP) and are independent of the preparation method."

[7] "For catalyst design it appears important to ascertain a high dispersion of the reducible metal oxides (MeOx) on an inert support. These metal oxides should be easily reduced by hydrocarbon rather than re-oxidized by an oxidant. This will spatially isolate active lattice oxygen species in MeOx aggregates favoring selective oxidation over a combustion reaction."

          The use of nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) offers several advantages in terms of propylene selectivity compared to other oxidants, particularly oxygen (O2):

1. Higher propene selectivity: N2O consistently provides higher propene selectivity compared to O2 at similar propane conversion levels across various V/MCM-41 catalysts.

2. Inhibition of undesired reactions: N2O inhibits direct propane oxidation and consecutive oxidation of propene to COx, leading to improved selectivity.

3. Lower surface density of active oxygen: N2O's weaker oxidizing potential results in a lower surface density of active lattice oxygen, which favors selective propene formation over combustion reactions.

4. Improved performance with crystalline V2O5: When using N2O, there is no significant difference in propene selectivity between highly dispersed surface VOx species and crystalline V2O5 nanoparticles, whereas V2O5 nanoparticles are not selective with O2.

The main catalysts employed in this process are vanadium-based catalysts supported on mesoporous materials, particularly V/MCM-41. These catalysts contain highly dispersed VOx species, classified as monomeric and small two-dimensional VOx aggregates, with vanadium loadings up to 5.3 wt%.

Critical challenges associated with N2O-ODHP include:

1. Lower catalytic activity: The use of N2O results in lower overall catalytic activity compared to O2 due to its weaker oxidizing potential for re-oxidizing reduced surface VOx sites.

2. Catalyst stability: While not explicitly mentioned in the given literature, catalyst deactivation and stability are common concerns in ODHP processes and likely apply to N2O-ODHP as well.

To address these limitations and make N2O-ODHP more feasible for practical implementation, the following strategies or research directions could be pursued:

1. Catalyst optimization: Develop catalysts that maintain high dispersion of reducible metal oxides (MeOx) on inert supports, focusing on materials that are easily reduced by hydrocarbons but not quickly re-oxidized by the oxidant.

2. Process engineering: Explore reactor designs and operating conditions that can maximize the benefits of N2O while minimizing its drawbacks, such as lower activity.

3. Hybrid oxidant systems: Investigate the potential of using N2O in combination with other oxidants to achieve an optimal balance between activity and selectivity.

4. Mechanistic studies: Conduct further research to better understand the reaction mechanisms and the role of different oxygen species in the ODHP process, which could lead to more targeted catalyst designs.

5. Long-term stability studies: Perform extensive research on catalyst stability and deactivation mechanisms in N2O-ODHP to develop strategies for improving catalyst longevity.

6. Economic and environmental assessment: Conduct comprehensive techno-economic and life cycle analyses to evaluate the feasibility of N2O-ODHP compared to conventional processes and identify areas for improvement.

By addressing these challenges and pursuing these research directions, N2O-ODHP could potentially become a more viable option for industrial-scale propylene production.

          一氧化二氮（N2O）作为丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）的氧化剂相比其他氧化剂，特别是氧气（O2），在丙烯选择性方面具有几个优势：

1. 更高的丙烯选择性：在相似的丙烷转化水平下，N2O在各种V/MCM-41催化剂上始终提供比O2更高的丙烯选择性。

2. 抑制不良反应：N2O抑制直接丙烷氧化和丙烯连续氧化为COx的反应，从而提高选择性。

3. 活性氧表面密度较低：N2O较弱的氧化能力导致活性晶格氧的表面密度较低，这有利于选择性丙烯形成而非燃烧反应。

4. 改善结晶V2O5的性能：使用N2O时，高度分散的表面VOx物种和结晶V2O5纳米颗粒之间的丙烯选择性没有显著差异，而在O2存在下，V2O5纳米颗粒不具有选择性。

这个过程中使用的主要催化剂是负载在介孔材料上的钒基催化剂，特别是V/MCM-41。这些催化剂含有高度分散的VOx物种，可分类为单体和小型二维VOx聚集体，钒含量最高可达5.3 wt%。

N2O-ODHP相关的关键挑战包括：

1. 较低的催化活性：由于N2O在重新氧化还原表面VOx位点方面具有较弱的氧化能力，使用N2O会导致整体催化活性较低。

2. 催化剂稳定性：虽然在给定的文献中没有明确提及，但催化剂失活和稳定性是ODHP过程中常见的问题，很可能也适用于N2O-ODHP。

为了解决这些限制并使N2O-ODHP更适合实际应用，可以采取以下策略和研究方向：

1. 催化剂优化：开发能在惰性载体上保持高分散度的可还原金属氧化物（MeOx）催化剂，重点关注易被碳氢化合物还原但不易被氧化剂快速再氧化的材料。

2. 工艺工程：探索能够最大化N2O优势同时最小化其缺点（如较低活性）的反应器设计和操作条件。

3. 混合氧化剂系统：研究将N2O与其他氧化剂结合使用的潜力，以在活性和选择性之间达到最佳平衡。

4. 机理研究：进行进一步研究，以更好地理解ODHP过程中的反应机理和不同氧物种的作用，这可能导致更有针对性的催化剂设计。

5. 长期稳定性研究：对N2O-ODHP中的催化剂稳定性和失活机理进行广泛研究，以制定提高催化剂寿命的策略。

6. 经济和环境评估：进行全面的技术经济和生命周期分析，评估N2O-ODHP与传统工艺相比的可行性，并确定需要改进的领域。

通过解决这些挑战并推进这些研究方向，N2O-ODHP可能成为工业规模丙烯生产的更可行选择。
