[1] "For all of the V/MCM-41 catalysts used in this study, higher propene selectivity is achieved with N2O as compared with O2 at similar degrees of C3H8 conversion."

[2] "The catalytic activity is lower, however, in the presence of N2O as compared with O2 because of the weaker oxidizing potential of N2O relative to O2 for the re-oxidation of the reduced surface VOx sites during the ODP reaction."

[3] "The positive effect of N2O is related to the inhibition of direct C3H8 oxidation and the consecutive oxidation of C3H6 to COx. The inhibition is ascribed to reducing surface density (spatial separation) of active surface lattice oxygen in VOx species, since N2O is a weaker oxidant for re-oxidation of reduced VOx species as compared with O2."

[4] "Highly dispersed VOx species, which can be classified as monomeric and small two-dimensional VOx aggregates, are present in materials with a vanadium loading of up to 5.3 wt% under conditions of the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODP) and are independent of the preparation method."

[5] "For catalyst design it appears important to ascertain a high dispersion of the reducible metal oxides (MeOx) on an inert support. These metal oxides should be easily reduced by hydrocarbon rather than re-oxidized by an oxidant. This will spatially isolate active lattice oxygen species in MeOx aggregates favoring selective oxidation over a combustion reaction."

The use of nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) offers several advantages in terms of propylene selectivity compared to other oxidants, particularly oxygen (O2):

1. Higher propylene selectivity: N2O consistently provides higher propene selectivity compared to O2 at similar propane conversion levels across various V/MCM-41 catalysts.

2. Inhibition of undesired reactions: N2O inhibits direct propane oxidation and consecutive oxidation of propene to COx (carbon oxides), leading to improved selectivity.

3. Spatial separation of active sites: N2O's weaker oxidizing potential results in a lower surface density of active lattice oxygen species, which favors selective oxidation over combustion reactions.

The catalysts employed in this process are primarily vanadium-based, supported on mesoporous materials like MCM-41. Highly dispersed VOx species, including monomeric and small two-dimensional VOx aggregates, are present in catalysts with vanadium loadings up to 5.3 wt%. These catalysts show similar intrinsic catalytic activity regardless of vanadium loading.

Critical challenges associated with N2O-ODHP include:

1. Lower catalytic activity: The use of N2O results in lower overall catalytic activity compared to O2 due to its weaker oxidizing potential.

2. Catalyst stability: While not explicitly mentioned in the given text, catalyst deactivation and stability are common concerns in ODHP processes and likely apply to N2O-ODHP as well.

To address these limitations and make N2O-ODHP more feasible for practical implementation, the following strategies or research directions could be pursued:

1. Catalyst optimization: Focus on developing catalysts with high dispersion of reducible metal oxides on inert supports, which are easily reduced by hydrocarbons but not readily re-oxidized by the oxidant.

2. Balancing activity and selectivity: Investigate methods to improve catalytic activity while maintaining the high selectivity offered by N2O, possibly through the use of promoters or novel support materials.

3. Process engineering: Explore reactor designs and operating conditions that can maximize the benefits of N2O while minimizing its drawbacks, such as lower activity.

4. Hybrid oxidant systems: Study the potential of using N2O in combination with other oxidants to achieve an optimal balance between activity and selectivity.

5. Economic and environmental assessment: Conduct comprehensive studies on the economic viability and environmental impact of N2O-ODHP compared to conventional processes to identify areas for improvement and potential advantages.

By pursuing these research directions, it may be possible to overcome the current limitations of N2O-ODHP and develop a more efficient and selective process for propylene production.

一氧化二氮（N2O）作为氧化剂在丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）中的使用在丙烯选择性方面相比其他氧化剂具有几个优势，特别是与氧气（O2）相比：

1. 更高的丙烯选择性：在相似的丙烷转化水平下，N2O在各种V/MCM-41催化剂上始终提供比O2更高的丙烯选择性。

2. 抑制不需要的反应：N2O抑制直接丙烷氧化和丙烯连续氧化成COx（碳氧化物），从而提高选择性。

3. 活性位点的空间分离：N2O较弱的氧化能力导致活性晶格氧物种的表面密度较低，有利于选择性氧化而非燃烧反应。

这个过程中使用的催化剂主要是基于钒的，负载在MCM-41等介孔材料上。在钒负载量高达5.3 wt%的催化剂中存在高度分散的VOx物种，包括单体和小型二维VOx聚集体。这些催化剂无论钒负载量如何都显示出相似的固有催化活性。

N2O-ODHP相关的关键挑战包括：

1. 较低的催化活性：由于N2O氧化能力较弱，使用N2O导致整体催化活性比O2低。

2. 催化剂稳定性：尽管在给定文本中没有明确提到，但催化剂失活和稳定性是ODHP过程中常见的问题，可能也适用于N2O-ODHP。

为了解决这些限制并使N2O-ODHP更适合实际应用，可以采取以下策略或研究方向：

1. 催化剂优化：专注于开发在惰性载体上具有高度分散的可还原金属氧化物的催化剂，这些氧化物易被烃类还原但不易被氧化剂重新氧化。

2. 平衡活性和选择性：研究提高催化活性的方法，同时保持N2O提供的高选择性，可能通过使用助剂或新型载体材料。

3. 工艺工程：探索反应器设计和操作条件，以最大化N2O的优势，同时最小化其缺点，如较低的活性。

4. 混合氧化剂系统：研究将N2O与其他氧化剂结合使用的潜力，以在活性和选择性之间达到最佳平衡。

5. 经济和环境评估：对比N2O-ODHP与传统工艺进行全面的经济可行性和环境影响研究，以确定改进领域和潜在优势。

通过追求这些研究方向，可能克服N2O-ODHP当前的限制，开发出更高效、更具选择性的丙烯生产工艺。
