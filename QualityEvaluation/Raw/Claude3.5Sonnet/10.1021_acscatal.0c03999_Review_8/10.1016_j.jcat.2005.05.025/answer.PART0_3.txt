[1] "For all of the V/MCM-41 catalysts used in this study, higher propene selectivity is achieved with N2O as compared with O2 at similar degrees of C3H8 conversion."

[2] "The catalytic activity is lower, however, in the presence of N2O as compared with O2 because of the weaker oxidizing potential of N2O relative to O2 for the re-oxidation of the reduced surface VOx sites during the ODP reaction."

[3] "There is no significant difference in propene selectivity between highly dispersed surface VOx species and crystalline V2O5 nanoparticles when N2O is used as an oxidant."

[4] "The positive effect of N2O is related to the inhibition of direct C3H8 oxidation and the consecutive oxidation of C3H6 to COx."

[5] "The inhibition is ascribed to reducing surface density (spatial separation) of active surface lattice oxygen in VOx species, since N2O is a weaker oxidant for re-oxidation of reduced VOx species as compared with O2."

The use of nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) offers several advantages in terms of propylene selectivity compared to other oxidants, particularly oxygen (O2):

1. Higher propene selectivity: N2O consistently achieves higher propene selectivity compared to O2 at similar propane conversion levels across various V/MCM-41 catalysts.

2. Inhibition of undesirable reactions: N2O inhibits both direct propane oxidation and consecutive oxidation of propene to COx, leading to improved selectivity.

3. Spatial separation of active sites: N2O's weaker oxidizing potential results in a lower surface density of active oxygen species, which favors propene formation over total oxidation.

4. Versatility across catalyst types: When using N2O, there is little difference in propene selectivity between highly dispersed surface VOx species and crystalline V2O5 nanoparticles, suggesting broader applicability.

The main catalysts employed in this process are vanadium-based, specifically V/MCM-41 catalysts with varying vanadium loadings. These catalysts contain highly dispersed VOx species on the MCM-41 support, with some forming crystalline V2O5 nanoparticles at higher loadings.

However, there are critical challenges associated with N2O-ODHP:

1. Lower catalytic activity: The use of N2O results in lower overall catalytic activity compared to O2 due to its weaker oxidizing potential.

2. Catalyst stability: While not explicitly mentioned in the given text, catalyst deactivation and stability are common concerns in ODHP processes and likely apply here as well.

To address these limitations and make N2O-ODHP more feasible for practical implementation, several strategies and research directions could be pursued:

1. Catalyst optimization: Develop catalysts that can maintain high propene selectivity while improving overall activity with N2O.

2. Mixed oxidant systems: Investigate the use of N2O in combination with other oxidants to balance selectivity and activity.

3. Process engineering: Explore reactor designs and operating conditions that can maximize the benefits of N2O while mitigating its limitations.

4. Mechanistic studies: Conduct in-depth research on the reaction mechanism to better understand and exploit the selective nature of N2O in ODHP.

5. Economical N2O production: Develop more efficient and cost-effective methods for producing N2O to make the process economically viable.

6. Catalyst stability improvement: Focus on enhancing the long-term stability of catalysts under N2O-ODHP conditions.

By addressing these challenges and pursuing these research directions, N2O-ODHP could potentially become a more feasible option for practical implementation in the production of propylene.

一氧化二氮（N2O）作为氧化剂在丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）中的使用在丙烯选择性方面相比其他氧化剂具有几个优势，特别是与氧气（O2）相比：

1. 更高的丙烯选择性：在各种V/MCM-41催化剂上，在相似的丙烷转化水平下，N2O始终实现比O2更高的丙烯选择性。

2. 抑制不良反应：N2O抑制了直接丙烷氧化和丙烯连续氧化为COx的反应，从而提高了选择性。

3. 活性位点的空间分离：N2O较弱的氧化能力导致活性氧物种的表面密度较低，这有利于丙烯形成而非完全氧化。

4. 适用于多种催化剂类型：使用N2O时，高分散表面VOx物种和结晶V2O5纳米颗粒之间的丙烯选择性差异很小，表明其具有更广泛的适用性。

这个过程中使用的主要催化剂是基于钒的，特别是具有不同钒负载量的V/MCM-41催化剂。这些催化剂在MCM-41载体上含有高度分散的VOx物种，在较高负载量时一些会形成结晶的V2O5纳米颗粒。

然而，N2O-ODHP存在一些关键挑战：

1. 较低的催化活性：由于N2O较弱的氧化能力，使用N2O会导致与O2相比整体催化活性较低。

2. 催化剂稳定性：虽然在给定文本中没有明确提到，但催化剂失活和稳定性是ODHP过程中常见的问题，可能也适用于这里。

为了解决这些限制并使N2O-ODHP更适合实际应用，可以采取以下几种策略和研究方向：

1. 催化剂优化：开发能够在使用N2O时保持高丙烯选择性同时提高整体活性的催化剂。

2. 混合氧化剂系统：研究N2O与其他氧化剂的组合使用，以平衡选择性和活性。

3. 工艺工程：探索能够最大化N2O优势同时减少其局限性的反应器设计和操作条件。

4. 机理研究：对反应机理进行深入研究，以更好地理解和利用N2O在ODHP中的选择性特性。

5. 经济的N2O生产：开发更高效和更具成本效益的N2O生产方法，使过程在经济上可行。

6. 提高催化剂稳定性：专注于提高催化剂在N2O-ODHP条件下的长期稳定性。

通过解决这些挑战并追求这些研究方向，N2O-ODHP可能成为一个更加可行的丙烯生产实际应用选择。
