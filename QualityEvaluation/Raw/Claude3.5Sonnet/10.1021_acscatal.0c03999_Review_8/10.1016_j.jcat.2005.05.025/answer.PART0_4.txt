[1] "For all of the V/MCM-41 catalysts used in this study, higher propene selectivity is achieved with N2O as compared with O2 at similar degrees of C3H8 conversion."

[2] "The catalytic activity is lower, however, in the presence of N2O as compared with O2 because of the weaker oxidizing potential of N2O relative to O2 for the re-oxidation of the reduced surface VOx sites during the ODP reaction."

[3] "The positive effect of N2O is related to the inhibition of direct C3H8 oxidation and the consecutive oxidation of C3H6 to COx. The inhibition is ascribed to reducing surface density (spatial separation) of active surface lattice oxygen in VOx species, since N2O is a weaker oxidant for re-oxidation of reduced VOx species as compared with O2."

[4] "For all of the V/MCM-41 materials, the use of N2O instead of O2 favors selective propane oxidation to propene over the total combustion of propane or propene."

[5] "The improving effect of N2O is related to site isolation of the active surface lattice oxygen species; thereby the direct deep propane and consecutive propene oxidation to COx is inhibited."

The use of nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) offers several advantages in terms of propylene selectivity compared to other oxidants, particularly oxygen (O2):

1. Higher propene selectivity: N2O consistently achieves higher propene selectivity compared to O2 at similar degrees of propane conversion across various V/MCM-41 catalysts.

2. Inhibition of undesirable reactions: N2O inhibits both direct propane oxidation and consecutive oxidation of propene to COx, leading to improved selectivity.

3. Spatial separation of active sites: N2O reduces the surface density of active surface lattice oxygen in VOx species, promoting site isolation and favoring selective oxidation over total combustion.

The main catalysts employed in this process are vanadium-based catalysts supported on mesoporous MCM-41. These catalysts show good performance with both O2 and N2O, but exhibit superior selectivity with N2O.

However, there are critical challenges associated with N2O-ODHP:

1. Lower catalytic activity: The use of N2O results in lower overall catalytic activity compared to O2 due to its weaker oxidizing potential for re-oxidizing reduced VOx sites.

2. Catalyst stability: While not explicitly mentioned in the given text, catalyst deactivation and stability are common concerns in ODHP processes and likely apply to N2O-ODHP as well.

To address these limitations and make N2O-ODHP more feasible for practical implementation, the following strategies or research directions could be pursued:

1. Catalyst design optimization: Develop catalysts that can maintain high dispersion of reducible metal oxides (MeOx) on inert supports, focusing on materials that are easily reduced by hydrocarbons but not quickly re-oxidized by N2O.

2. Process engineering: Investigate ways to compensate for the lower activity with N2O, such as optimizing reaction conditions, exploring novel reactor designs, or developing regeneration strategies.

3. Hybrid oxidant systems: Explore the potential of using N2O in combination with other oxidants to balance selectivity and activity.

4. Economic and sustainability studies: Conduct comprehensive analyses of N2O-ODHP processes, including the availability and production of N2O in sufficient quantities, to assess the overall feasibility and potential advantages over conventional processes.

5. In-situ characterization studies: Perform detailed investigations of catalyst behavior under reaction conditions to better understand deactivation mechanisms and develop strategies for improving catalyst stability.

By addressing these challenges and pursuing these research directions, N2O-ODHP could potentially become a more viable option for industrial-scale propylene production.

一氧化二氮（N2O）作为丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）的氧化剂相比其他氧化剂在丙烯选择性方面具有几个优势：

1. 更高的丙烯选择性：在相似的丙烷转化度下，N2O在各种V/MCM-41催化剂上始终实现比O2更高的丙烯选择性。

2. 抑制不良反应：N2O抑制了直接丙烷氧化和丙烯连续氧化成COx的反应，从而提高了选择性。

3. 活性位点的空间分离：N2O降低了VOx物种中活性表面晶格氧的表面密度，促进了位点隔离，有利于选择性氧化而非完全燃烧。

这一过程中使用的主要催化剂是负载在介孔MCM-41上的钒基催化剂。这些催化剂在O2和N2O的条件下都表现出良好的性能，但在N2O条件下表现出更优的选择性。

然而，N2O-ODHP也面临一些关键挑战：

1. 较低的催化活性：由于N2O再氧化还原态VOx位点的能力较弱，使用N2O会导致整体催化活性低于O2。

2. 催化剂稳定性：虽然文本中没有明确提及，但催化剂失活和稳定性是ODHP过程中常见的问题，很可能也适用于N2O-ODHP。

为了解决这些限制并使N2O-ODHP更适合实际应用，可以采取以下策略或研究方向：

1. 优化催化剂设计：开发能在惰性载体上保持高分散度的可还原金属氧化物（MeOx）催化剂，重点关注易被碳氢化合物还原但不易被N2O快速再氧化的材料。

2. 工艺工程：研究补偿N2O较低活性的方法，如优化反应条件、探索新型反应器设计或开发再生策略。

3. 混合氧化剂系统：探索将N2O与其他氧化剂结合使用的潜力，以平衡选择性和活性。

4. 经济和可持续性研究：对N2O-ODHP过程进行全面分析，包括N2O的可获得性和大量生产，以评估其整体可行性和相对于传统工艺的潜在优势。

5. 原位表征研究：在反应条件下对催化剂行为进行详细研究，以更好地理解失活机制并制定提高催化剂稳定性的策略。

通过解决这些挑战并追求这些研究方向，N2O-ODHP可能成为更可行的工业规模丙烯生产选择。
