The use of nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) offers significant advantages over traditional oxidants like dioxygen. With dioxygen, excessive formation of carbon oxides occurs even at moderate alkane conversions, leading to low olefin selectivity and yield. In contrast, N2O allows for higher propylene selectivity.

Iron-zeolites have emerged as promising catalysts for N2O-ODHP, particularly for converting propane to propylene. These catalysts have shown good performance, with some studies reporting stable propane conversion and propylene production rates over extended periods.

However, catalyst deactivation remains a critical challenge in ODHP, regardless of the oxidant used. The main cause of deactivation is coke formation and deposition on the catalyst surface. This issue limits the long-term stability and efficiency of the catalysts.

To address these limitations and make N2O-ODHP more feasible for practical implementation, research could focus on:

1. Developing more coke-resistant catalysts or modifying existing ones to minimize coke formation.
2. Optimizing reaction conditions, such as the N2O/C3H8 ratio, to balance conversion and selectivity while minimizing deactivation.
3. Investigating regeneration methods to extend catalyst lifetime.
4. Exploring novel catalyst supports or promoters that can enhance stability and selectivity.
5. Studying the mechanism of coke formation in N2O-ODHP to develop targeted strategies for its prevention.
6. Investigating the potential of combining N2O with other oxidants or using it in multistep processes to maximize overall efficiency.

By addressing these challenges, N2O-ODHP could become a more viable and sustainable option for propylene production in the petrochemical industry.

使用一氧化二氮（N2O）作为氧化剂在丙烷的氧化脱氢（ODHP）反应中比传统的氧气氧化剂具有显著优势。使用氧气时，即使在中等烷烃转化率下也会产生过量的碳氧化物，导致烯烃选择性和产率低。相比之下，N2O可以实现更高的丙烯选择性。

铁沸石已经成为N2O-ODHP有前景的催化剂，特别是用于将丙烷转化为丙烯。这些催化剂表现出良好的性能，一些研究报告了在长时间内稳定的丙烷转化率和丙烯产率。

然而，无论使用何种氧化剂，催化剂失活仍然是ODHP面临的一个关键挑战。失活的主要原因是焦炭在催化剂表面的形成和沉积。这个问题限制了催化剂的长期稳定性和效率。

为了解决这些限制并使N2O-ODHP更适合实际应用，研究可以集中在以下几个方面：

1. 开发更耐焦炭的催化剂或改进现有催化剂以最小化焦炭形成。
2. 优化反应条件，如N2O/C3H8比例，以平衡转化率和选择性，同时最小化失活。
3. 研究再生方法以延长催化剂寿命。
4. 探索新型催化剂载体或助剂，以提高稳定性和选择性。
5. 研究N2O-ODHP中焦炭形成的机理，以开发针对性的预防策略。
6. 研究将N2O与其他氧化剂结合使用或在多步骤过程中使用的潜力，以最大化整体效率。

通过解决这些挑战，N2O-ODHP可能成为石油化工行业丙烯生产的更可行和可持续的选择。

The use of nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) offers significant advantages over traditional oxidants like dioxygen. The main benefit is improved propylene selectivity. When dioxygen is used, extensive formation of carbon oxides occurs even at moderate alkane conversions, leading to low olefin selectivity and yield. N2O, on the other hand, allows for better control of the oxidation process.

Iron-zeolites have emerged as promising catalysts for N2O-ODHP, particularly for converting propane to propylene. These catalysts have shown unique properties that make them well-suited for this reaction.

However, catalyst deactivation remains a critical challenge in ODHP, regardless of the oxidant used. The primary cause of deactivation is the formation and deposition of coke on the catalyst surface. In N2O-ODHP specifically, the accumulation of organic species, mainly alkylbenzenes, has been observed during the reaction.

Despite these challenges, some progress has been made in improving catalyst stability. For instance, research has shown that adjusting the N2O/C3H8 ratio can significantly impact catalyst performance. A ratio of 1:2 has been found to maintain a stable propane conversion rate of about 13 mmol gcat−1 h−1 and a propylene production rate of about 6 mmol gcat−1 h−1 for over 40 hours.

To address the limitations and make N2O-ODHP more feasible for practical implementation, several research directions could be pursued:

1. Catalyst design: Develop catalysts that are more resistant to coke formation and deactivation, possibly by modifying the iron-zeolite structure or introducing promoters.

2. Reaction conditions optimization: Further investigate the effects of reaction parameters like temperature, pressure, and feed composition on catalyst stability and propylene selectivity.

3. Regeneration strategies: Explore efficient methods to regenerate deactivated catalysts, potentially allowing for longer overall catalyst lifetimes.

4. Understanding coke formation: Conduct in-depth studies on the mechanisms of coke formation and accumulation to develop targeted prevention strategies.

5. Alternative catalyst supports: Investigate other porous materials as supports for iron species that might offer improved stability or selectivity.

6. Process integration: Develop innovative reactor designs or process configurations that could mitigate catalyst deactivation or improve overall process efficiency.

By focusing on these areas, researchers may be able to overcome the current limitations of N2O-ODHP and make it a more viable option for industrial propylene production.

Nitrous oxide (N2O) has emerged as a promising alternative oxidant to dioxygen in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP). The main advantage of using N2O is its ability to produce propylene with higher selectivity compared to dioxygen. This is because dioxygen tends to cause over-oxidation, leading to the formation of carbon oxides (CO and CO2) even at moderate alkane conversions, resulting in low olefin selectivity and yield.

Iron-zeolites, particularly Fe-ZSM-5, have been developed as effective catalysts for N2O-ODHP. These catalysts have shown good performance in terms of propylene yield and conversion rates.

一氧化二氮（N2O）已成为丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）中二氧的一种有前景的替代氧化剂。使用N2O的主要优势是它能够以更高的选择性生产丙烯，相比二氧而言。这是因为二氧倾向于导致过度氧化，即使在中等烷烃转化率下也会形成碳氧化物（CO和CO2），从而导致低烯烃选择性和产率。

铁沸石，特别是Fe-ZSM-5，已被开发为N2O-ODHP的有效催化剂。这些催化剂在丙烯产率和转化率方面表现出良好的性能。例如，使用N2O/C3H8比例为1:2时，稳定的丙烷转化率约为13 mmol gcat-1 h-1，丙烯生产率约为6 mmol gcat-1 h-1，这种性能可以持续40小时以上。

The use of nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) offers significant advantages over traditional oxidants like dioxygen. N2O provides higher propylene selectivity by reducing the formation of carbon oxides that result from over-oxidation when using dioxygen. This leads to improved olefin yields and selectivity.

Iron-zeolites, particularly Fe-ZSM-5, have emerged as effective catalysts for N2O-ODHP. These catalysts have shown promising performance in terms of propylene yield and turnover frequency.

However, catalyst deactivation remains a critical challenge in N2O-ODHP. The main cause of deactivation is the formation and deposition of coke on the catalyst surface. Specifically, alkylbenzenes have been identified as the major organic species accumulating during the reaction.

Interestingly, the rate of coke formation and the types of alkylbenzenes produced depend on the relative partial pressures of propane and nitrous oxide. Lower N2O/C3H8 ratios lead to the formation of smaller aromatics that accumulate more slowly, resulting in lower deactivation rates and extended catalyst lifetimes.

To address these limitations and improve the practical feasibility of N2O-ODHP, several strategies could be explored:

1. Optimizing the N2O/C3H8 ratio: As lower ratios have shown to reduce deactivation rates, further research into finding the optimal balance between reactivity and stability could be beneficial.

2. Catalyst design: Developing catalysts that are more resistant to coke formation or can facilitate coke removal could significantly improve long-term stability.

3. Process engineering: Implementing continuous regeneration processes or novel reactor designs that minimize coke accumulation could enhance the overall efficiency of the system.

4. Understanding coke formation mechanisms: More in-depth studies on the formation of alkylbenzenes and other coke precursors could lead to better strategies for preventing their accumulation.

5. Exploring synergistic effects: Investigating the use of co-catalysts or promoters that could enhance activity while suppressing coke formation might yield improved catalytic systems.

By addressing these challenges, N2O-ODHP could become a more viable option for industrial-scale propylene production, offering a more selective and potentially more sustainable alternative to current processes.

在氧化脱氢丙烷(ODHP)反应中使用一氧化二氮(N2O)作为氧化剂比传统的氧气氧化剂有显著优势。N2O能提供更高的丙烯选择性，减少使用氧气时过度氧化产生的碳氧化物。这导致更高的烯烃产率和选择性。

铁沸石，特别是Fe-ZSM-5，已成为N2O-ODHP反应的有效催化剂。这些催化剂在丙烯产率和转化频率方面表现出良好的性能。

然而，催化剂失活仍然是N2O-ODHP面临的一个关键挑战。失活的主要原因是催化剂表面焦炭的形成和沉积。具体来说，烷基苯被确定为反应过程中积累的主要有机物种。

有趣的是，焦炭形成速率和产生的烷基苯类型取决于丙烷和一氧化二氮的相对分压。较低的N2O/C3H8比率会导致形成较小的芳烃，这些芳烃积累得更慢，从而导致较低的失活率和更长的催化剂寿命。

为了解决这些限制并提高N2O-ODHP的实际可行性，可以探索以下几种策略：

1. 优化N2O/C3H8比率：由于较低的比率已显示出可以降低失活率，因此进一步研究反应性和稳定性之间的最佳平衡可能会有益。

2. 催化剂设计：开发对焦炭形成更具抵抗力或能促进焦炭去除的催化剂可以显著提高长期稳定性。

3. 工艺工程：实施连续再生过程或能最大限度减少焦炭积累的新型反应器设计可以提高系统的整体效率。

4. 了解焦炭形成机理：对烷基苯和其他焦炭前体的形成进行更深入的研究可能会带来更好的防止积累策略。

5. 探索协同效应：研究可以增强活性同时抑制焦炭形成的助催化剂或促进剂的使用可能会产生改进的催化系统。

通过解决这些挑战，N2O-ODHP可能成为工业规模丙烯生产的更可行选择，提供比当前工艺更具选择性和潜在更可持续的替代方案。
