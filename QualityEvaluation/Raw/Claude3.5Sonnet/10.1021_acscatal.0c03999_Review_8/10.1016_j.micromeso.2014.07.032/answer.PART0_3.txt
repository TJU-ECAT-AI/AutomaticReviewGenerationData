Nitrous oxide (N2O) has emerged as a promising alternative oxidant to dioxygen in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP). The main advantage of using N2O is its ability to produce propylene with higher selectivity compared to dioxygen. This is because dioxygen tends to cause over-oxidation, leading to the formation of carbon oxides (CO and CO2) even at moderate alkane conversions, resulting in low olefin selectivity and yield.

Iron-zeolites, particularly Fe-ZSM-5, have been developed as effective catalysts for N2O-ODHP. These catalysts have shown good performance in terms of propylene yield and conversion rates. For instance, a stable propane conversion rate of about 13 mmol gcat-1 h-1 and a propylene production rate of about 6 mmol gcat-1 h-1 have been maintained for over 40 hours using a N2O/C3H8 ratio of 1:2.

However, catalyst deactivation remains a critical challenge in N2O-ODHP, as it is in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions in general. The main cause of deactivation is the formation and deposition of coke on the catalyst surface. Specifically, the accumulation of organic species, primarily alkylbenzenes, has been observed during the reaction.

To address these limitations and make N2O-ODHP more feasible for practical implementation, several research directions can be proposed:

1. Catalyst design: Develop catalysts that are more resistant to coke formation or can regenerate more easily.

2. Reaction conditions optimization: Further investigate the effect of N2O/C3H8 ratios and other reaction parameters on catalyst stability and propylene selectivity.

3. In-situ regeneration techniques: Explore methods to remove coke deposits during the reaction without interrupting the process.

4. Understanding coke formation mechanisms: Conduct more detailed studies on the formation of alkylbenzenes and other coke precursors to develop strategies for minimizing their accumulation.

5. Alternative catalyst supports: Investigate other zeolite structures or novel support materials that may offer improved stability or selectivity.

6. Process engineering: Develop innovative reactor designs or process configurations that could mitigate catalyst deactivation or improve overall efficiency.

By focusing on these areas, researchers may be able to overcome the current limitations of N2O-ODHP and make it a more viable option for industrial propylene production.

一氧化二氮（N2O）已成为丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）中二氧的一种有前景的替代氧化剂。使用N2O的主要优势是它能够以更高的选择性生产丙烯，相比二氧而言。这是因为二氧倾向于导致过度氧化，即使在中等烷烃转化率下也会形成碳氧化物（CO和CO2），从而导致低烯烃选择性和产率。

铁沸石，特别是Fe-ZSM-5，已被开发为N2O-ODHP的有效催化剂。这些催化剂在丙烯产率和转化率方面表现出良好的性能。例如，使用N2O/C3H8比例为1:2时，稳定的丙烷转化率约为13 mmol gcat-1 h-1，丙烯生产率约为6 mmol gcat-1 h-1，这种性能可以持续40小时以上。

然而，催化剂失活仍然是N2O-ODHP面临的一个关键挑战，就像在氧化脱氢反应中普遍存在的问题一样。失活的主要原因是催化剂表面焦炭的形成和沉积。具体来说，在反应过程中观察到有机物种（主要是烷基苯）的积累。

为了解决这些限制并使N2O-ODHP更适合实际应用，可以提出几个研究方向：

1. 催化剂设计：开发对焦炭形成更具抗性或更容易再生的催化剂。

2. 反应条件优化：进一步研究N2O/C3H8比例和其他反应参数对催化剂稳定性和丙烯选择性的影响。

3. 原位再生技术：探索在不中断反应过程的情况下去除焦炭沉积物的方法。

4. 了解焦炭形成机制：对烷基苯和其他焦炭前体的形成进行更详细的研究，以制定最小化其积累的策略。

5. 替代催化剂载体：研究其他沸石结构或新型载体材料，可能提供更好的稳定性或选择性。

6. 工艺工程：开发创新的反应器设计或工艺配置，可以减轻催化剂失活或提高整体效率。

通过关注这些领域，研究人员可能能够克服N2O-ODHP当前的限制，使其成为更可行的工业丙烯生产选择。
