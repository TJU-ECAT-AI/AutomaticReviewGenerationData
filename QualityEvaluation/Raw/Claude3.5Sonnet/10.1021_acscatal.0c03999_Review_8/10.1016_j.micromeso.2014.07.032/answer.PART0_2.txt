[1] "Recently, it has been proposed to use nitrous oxide instead of dioxygen as oxidant, and the oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes with N2O has attracted considerable attention [213]."

The use of nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) offers significant advantages in terms of propylene selectivity compared to other oxidants, particularly dioxygen. When dioxygen is used, extensive formation of carbon oxides occurs due to over-oxidation, resulting in low olefin selectivity and yield. In contrast, N2O allows for better control of the oxidation process, leading to improved propylene selectivity.

Iron-zeolites have emerged as prominent catalysts for N2O-ODHP, showing unique catalytic properties for this reaction. These catalysts have demonstrated promising performance in converting propane to propylene using N2O as the oxidant.

However, catalyst deactivation remains a critical challenge in N2O-ODHP, as it does in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions in general. The primary cause of deactivation is the formation and deposition of coke on the catalyst surface. Specifically, the accumulation of organic species, mainly alkylbenzenes, has been observed during the reaction.

Despite these challenges, some progress has been made in improving catalyst stability. For instance, research has shown that a stable propane conversion rate of about 13 mmol gcat-1 h-1 and a propylene production rate of about 6 mmol gcat-1 h-1 can be maintained for over 40 hours using a N2O/C3H8 ratio of 1:2.

To address the limitations and make N2O-ODHP more feasible for practical implementation, several strategies could be explored:

1. Catalyst design: Develop catalysts with improved resistance to coke formation, possibly by modifying the acidity of zeolites or incorporating promoters that inhibit coke deposition.

2. Reaction conditions optimization: Further investigate the effects of N2O/C3H8 ratios and other reaction parameters on catalyst stability and propylene selectivity.

3. Regeneration techniques: Explore efficient methods for in-situ or periodic catalyst regeneration to remove coke deposits and restore catalyst activity.

4. Advanced characterization: Utilize cutting-edge characterization techniques to better understand the mechanisms of coke formation and catalyst deactivation, informing the design of more stable catalysts.

5. Process integration: Investigate the potential for integrating N2O-ODHP with other processes, such as N2O abatement technologies, to improve overall efficiency and environmental performance.

By pursuing these research directions, it may be possible to overcome the current limitations of N2O-ODHP and develop a more practical and sustainable process for propylene production.

在氧化脱氢丙烷(ODHP)反应中使用一氧化二氮(N2O)作为氧化剂相比其他氧化剂在丙烯选择性方面具有显著优势。当使用二氧化氮时，由于过度氧化会形成大量的碳氧化物，导致烯烃选择性和产率较低。相比之下，N2O可以更好地控制氧化过程，从而提高丙烯选择性。

铁沸石已成为N2O-ODHP反应的重要催化剂，在这一反应中表现出独特的催化性能。这些催化剂在使用N2O作为氧化剂将丙烷转化为丙烯的过程中展现出了良好的性能。

然而，催化剂失活仍然是N2O-ODHP反应面临的一个关键挑战，这也是氧化脱氢反应普遍存在的问题。失活的主要原因是催化剂表面焦炭的形成和沉积。具体来说，在反应过程中观察到有机物种（主要是烷基苯）的积累。

尽管面临这些挑战，但在提高催化剂稳定性方面已经取得了一些进展。例如，研究表明，使用1:2的N2O/C3H8比例，可以在40小时以上的时间内保持约13 mmol gcat-1 h-1的稳定丙烷转化率和约6 mmol gcat-1 h-1的丙烯生产率。

为了解决这些限制并使N2O-ODHP更适合实际应用，可以探索以下几种策略：

1. 催化剂设计：开发对焦炭形成具有更强抗性的催化剂，可能通过改变沸石的酸性或引入抑制焦炭沉积的助剂来实现。

2. 反应条件优化：进一步研究N2O/C3H8比例和其他反应参数对催化剂稳定性和丙烯选择性的影响。

3. 再生技术：探索高效的原位或周期性催化剂再生方法，以去除焦炭沉积物并恢复催化剂活性。

4. 先进表征：利用尖端表征技术更好地理解焦炭形成和催化剂失活的机理，为设计更稳定的催化剂提供信息。

5. 工艺集成：研究将N2O-ODHP与其他工艺（如N2O消除技术）集成的可能性，以提高整体效率和环境性能。

通过追求这些研究方向，有可能克服N2O-ODHP当前的局限性，开发出更实用、更可持续的丙烯生产工艺。
