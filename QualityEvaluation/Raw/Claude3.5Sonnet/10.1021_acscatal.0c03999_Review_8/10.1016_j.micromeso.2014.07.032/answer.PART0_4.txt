[1] "Recently, it has been proposed to use nitrous oxide instead of dioxygen as oxidant, and the oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes with N2O has attracted considerable attention [213]. Iron-zeolites have been developed as unique catalysts for the oxidative dehydrogenation of light alkanes with N2O, especially the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propylene (ODHP)."

[2] "During the oxidative dehydrogenation of light alkanes with dioxygen, carbon oxides (CO and CO2) are extensively formed by over-oxidation even at moderate alkane conversions, resulting in low olefin selectivity and olefin yield [1]."

[3] "Catalyst deactivation is a key issue in the reaction of oxidative dehydrogenation, no matter whether dioxygen or nitrous oxide is used as oxidant. In a general sense, formation and deposition of coke on the catalyst surface are responsible for catalyst deactivation."

[4] "The accumulation of organic species in the catalyst is observed during the reaction, and the major organic species are determined to be alkylbenzenes. The accumulation rate and the specific constitution of alkylbenzenes are found to depend on the relative partial pressures of propane and nitrous oxide: lower N2O/C3H8 ratios result in formation of aromatics with smaller kinetic diameter, which are accumulated at a lower rate. This leads to lower deactivation rates and longer catalyst lifetimes."

[5] "Remarkably, a superior stable propane conversion rate of ca. 13 mmol gcat1 h1 and a propylene production rate of ca. 6 mmol gcat1 h1 can be kept for >40 h with a N2O/C3H8 ratio of 1:2."

The use of nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) offers significant advantages over traditional oxidants like dioxygen. N2O provides higher propylene selectivity by reducing the formation of carbon oxides that result from over-oxidation when using dioxygen. This leads to improved olefin yields and selectivity.

Iron-zeolites, particularly Fe-ZSM-5, have emerged as effective catalysts for N2O-ODHP. These catalysts have shown promising performance in terms of propylene yield and turnover frequency.

However, catalyst deactivation remains a critical challenge in N2O-ODHP. The main cause of deactivation is the formation and deposition of coke on the catalyst surface. Specifically, alkylbenzenes have been identified as the major organic species accumulating during the reaction.

Interestingly, the rate of coke formation and the types of alkylbenzenes produced depend on the relative partial pressures of propane and nitrous oxide. Lower N2O/C3H8 ratios lead to the formation of smaller aromatics that accumulate more slowly, resulting in lower deactivation rates and extended catalyst lifetimes.

To address these limitations and improve the practical feasibility of N2O-ODHP, several strategies could be explored:

1. Optimizing the N2O/C3H8 ratio: As lower ratios have shown to reduce deactivation rates, further research into finding the optimal balance between reactivity and stability could be beneficial.

2. Catalyst design: Developing catalysts that are more resistant to coke formation or can facilitate coke removal could significantly improve long-term stability.

3. Process engineering: Implementing continuous regeneration processes or novel reactor designs that minimize coke accumulation could enhance the overall efficiency of the system.

4. Understanding coke formation mechanisms: More in-depth studies on the formation of alkylbenzenes and other coke precursors could lead to better strategies for preventing their accumulation.

5. Exploring synergistic effects: Investigating the use of co-catalysts or promoters that could enhance activity while suppressing coke formation might yield improved catalytic systems.

By addressing these challenges, N2O-ODHP could become a more viable option for industrial-scale propylene production, offering a more selective and potentially more sustainable alternative to current processes.

在氧化脱氢丙烷(ODHP)反应中使用一氧化二氮(N2O)作为氧化剂比传统的氧气氧化剂有显著优势。N2O能提供更高的丙烯选择性，减少使用氧气时过度氧化产生的碳氧化物。这导致更高的烯烃产率和选择性。

铁沸石，特别是Fe-ZSM-5，已成为N2O-ODHP反应的有效催化剂。这些催化剂在丙烯产率和转化频率方面表现出良好的性能。

然而，催化剂失活仍然是N2O-ODHP面临的一个关键挑战。失活的主要原因是催化剂表面焦炭的形成和沉积。具体来说，烷基苯被确定为反应过程中积累的主要有机物种。

有趣的是，焦炭形成速率和产生的烷基苯类型取决于丙烷和一氧化二氮的相对分压。较低的N2O/C3H8比率会导致形成较小的芳烃，这些芳烃积累得更慢，从而导致较低的失活率和更长的催化剂寿命。

为了解决这些限制并提高N2O-ODHP的实际可行性，可以探索以下几种策略：

1. 优化N2O/C3H8比率：由于较低的比率已显示出可以降低失活率，因此进一步研究反应性和稳定性之间的最佳平衡可能会有益。

2. 催化剂设计：开发对焦炭形成更具抵抗力或能促进焦炭去除的催化剂可以显著提高长期稳定性。

3. 工艺工程：实施连续再生过程或能最大限度减少焦炭积累的新型反应器设计可以提高系统的整体效率。

4. 了解焦炭形成机理：对烷基苯和其他焦炭前体的形成进行更深入的研究可能会带来更好的防止积累策略。

5. 探索协同效应：研究可以增强活性同时抑制焦炭形成的助催化剂或促进剂的使用可能会产生改进的催化系统。

通过解决这些挑战，N2O-ODHP可能成为工业规模丙烯生产的更可行选择，提供比当前工艺更具选择性和潜在更可持续的替代方案。
