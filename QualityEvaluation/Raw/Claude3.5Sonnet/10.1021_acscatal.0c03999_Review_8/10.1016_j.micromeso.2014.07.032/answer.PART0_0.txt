[1] "Recently, it has been proposed to use nitrous oxide instead of dioxygen as oxidant, and the oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes with N2O has attracted considerable attention [213]."

[2] "During the oxidative dehydrogenation of light alkanes with dioxygen, carbon oxides (CO and CO2) are extensively formed by over-oxidation even at moderate alkane conversions, resulting in low olefin selectivity and olefin yield [1]."

[3] "Iron-zeolites have been developed as unique catalysts for the oxidative dehydrogenation of light alkanes with N2O, especially the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propylene (ODHP)."

[4] "Catalyst deactivation is a key issue in the reaction of oxidative dehydrogenation, no matter whether dioxygen or nitrous oxide is used as oxidant. In a general sense, formation and deposition of coke on the catalyst surface are responsible for catalyst deactivation."

[5] "Remarkably, a superior stable propane conversion rate of ca. 13 mmol gcat−1 h−1 and a propylene production rate of ca. 6 mmol gcat−1 h−1 can be kept for >40 h with a N2O/C3H8 ratio of 1:2."

The use of nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) offers significant advantages over traditional oxidants like dioxygen. With dioxygen, excessive formation of carbon oxides occurs even at moderate alkane conversions, leading to low olefin selectivity and yield. In contrast, N2O allows for higher propylene selectivity.

Iron-zeolites have emerged as promising catalysts for N2O-ODHP, particularly for converting propane to propylene. These catalysts have shown good performance, with some studies reporting stable propane conversion and propylene production rates over extended periods.

However, catalyst deactivation remains a critical challenge in ODHP, regardless of the oxidant used. The main cause of deactivation is coke formation and deposition on the catalyst surface. This issue limits the long-term stability and efficiency of the catalysts.

To address these limitations and make N2O-ODHP more feasible for practical implementation, research could focus on:

1. Developing more coke-resistant catalysts or modifying existing ones to minimize coke formation.
2. Optimizing reaction conditions, such as the N2O/C3H8 ratio, to balance conversion and selectivity while minimizing deactivation.
3. Investigating regeneration methods to extend catalyst lifetime.
4. Exploring novel catalyst supports or promoters that can enhance stability and selectivity.
5. Studying the mechanism of coke formation in N2O-ODHP to develop targeted strategies for its prevention.
6. Investigating the potential of combining N2O with other oxidants or using it in multistep processes to maximize overall efficiency.

By addressing these challenges, N2O-ODHP could become a more viable and sustainable option for propylene production in the petrochemical industry.

使用一氧化二氮（N2O）作为氧化剂在丙烷的氧化脱氢（ODHP）反应中比传统的氧气氧化剂具有显著优势。使用氧气时，即使在中等烷烃转化率下也会产生过量的碳氧化物，导致烯烃选择性和产率低。相比之下，N2O可以实现更高的丙烯选择性。

铁沸石已经成为N2O-ODHP有前景的催化剂，特别是用于将丙烷转化为丙烯。这些催化剂表现出良好的性能，一些研究报告了在长时间内稳定的丙烷转化率和丙烯产率。

然而，无论使用何种氧化剂，催化剂失活仍然是ODHP面临的一个关键挑战。失活的主要原因是焦炭在催化剂表面的形成和沉积。这个问题限制了催化剂的长期稳定性和效率。

为了解决这些限制并使N2O-ODHP更适合实际应用，研究可以集中在以下几个方面：

1. 开发更耐焦炭的催化剂或改进现有催化剂以最小化焦炭形成。
2. 优化反应条件，如N2O/C3H8比例，以平衡转化率和选择性，同时最小化失活。
3. 研究再生方法以延长催化剂寿命。
4. 探索新型催化剂载体或助剂，以提高稳定性和选择性。
5. 研究N2O-ODHP中焦炭形成的机理，以开发针对性的预防策略。
6. 研究将N2O与其他氧化剂结合使用或在多步骤过程中使用的潜力，以最大化整体效率。

通过解决这些挑战，N2O-ODHP可能成为石油化工行业丙烯生产的更可行和可持续的选择。
