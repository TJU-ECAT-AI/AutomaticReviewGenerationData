[1] "Recently, it has been proposed to use nitrous oxide instead of dioxygen as oxidant, and the oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes with N2O has attracted considerable attention [213]."

[2] "During the oxidative dehydrogenation of light alkanes with dioxygen, carbon oxides (CO and CO2) are extensively formed by over-oxidation even at moderate alkane conversions, resulting in low olefin selectivity and olefin yield [1]."

The use of nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) offers significant advantages over traditional oxidants like dioxygen. The main benefit is improved propylene selectivity. When dioxygen is used, extensive formation of carbon oxides occurs even at moderate alkane conversions, leading to low olefin selectivity and yield. N2O, on the other hand, allows for better control of the oxidation process.

Iron-zeolites have emerged as promising catalysts for N2O-ODHP, particularly for converting propane to propylene. These catalysts have shown unique properties that make them well-suited for this reaction.

However, catalyst deactivation remains a critical challenge in ODHP, regardless of the oxidant used. The primary cause of deactivation is the formation and deposition of coke on the catalyst surface. In N2O-ODHP specifically, the accumulation of organic species, mainly alkylbenzenes, has been observed during the reaction.

Despite these challenges, some progress has been made in improving catalyst stability. For instance, research has shown that adjusting the N2O/C3H8 ratio can significantly impact catalyst performance. A ratio of 1:2 has been found to maintain a stable propane conversion rate of about 13 mmol gcat−1 h−1 and a propylene production rate of about 6 mmol gcat−1 h−1 for over 40 hours.

To address the limitations and make N2O-ODHP more feasible for practical implementation, several research directions could be pursued:

1. Catalyst design: Develop catalysts that are more resistant to coke formation and deactivation, possibly by modifying the iron-zeolite structure or introducing promoters.

2. Reaction conditions optimization: Further investigate the effects of reaction parameters like temperature, pressure, and feed composition on catalyst stability and propylene selectivity.

3. Regeneration strategies: Explore efficient methods to regenerate deactivated catalysts, potentially allowing for longer overall catalyst lifetimes.

4. Understanding coke formation: Conduct in-depth studies on the mechanisms of coke formation and accumulation to develop targeted prevention strategies.

5. Alternative catalyst supports: Investigate other porous materials as supports for iron species that might offer improved stability or selectivity.

6. Process integration: Develop innovative reactor designs or process configurations that could mitigate catalyst deactivation or improve overall process efficiency.

By focusing on these areas, researchers may be able to overcome the current limitations of N2O-ODHP and make it a more viable option for industrial propylene production.

使用一氧化二氮（N2O）作为氧化剂在丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）中具有显著优势，相比传统的氧化剂如氧气。主要优势在于提高了丙烯的选择性。使用氧气时，即使在中等烷烃转化率下也会大量形成碳氧化物，导致低烯烃选择性和产率。相比之下，N2O允许更好地控制氧化过程。

铁沸石已经成为N2O-ODHP有前景的催化剂，特别是用于将丙烷转化为丙烯。这些催化剂展现出独特的性质，使其非常适合这种反应。

然而，催化剂失活仍然是ODHP中的一个关键挑战，无论使用何种氧化剂。失活的主要原因是催化剂表面焦炭的形成和沉积。具体到N2O-ODHP，在反应过程中观察到有机物种（主要是烷基苯）的积累。

尽管存在这些挑战，但在改善催化剂稳定性方面已经取得了一些进展。例如，研究表明调整N2O/C3H8比例可以显著影响催化剂性能。1:2的比例被发现可以维持稳定的丙烷转化率约13 mmol gcat−1 h−1和丙烯生产率约6 mmol gcat−1 h−1，持续超过40小时。

为了解决这些限制并使N2O-ODHP更适合实际应用，可以pursue几个研究方向：

1. 催化剂设计：开发对焦炭形成和失活更具抗性的催化剂，可能通过修改铁沸石结构或引入助剂。

2. 反应条件优化：进一步研究温度、压力和进料组成等反应参数对催化剂稳定性和丙烯选择性的影响。

3. 再生策略：探索高效的失活催化剂再生方法，可能允许更长的整体催化剂寿命。

4. 理解焦炭形成：对焦炭形成和积累机理进行深入研究，以开发针对性预防策略。

5. 替代催化剂载体：研究其他多孔材料作为铁物种的载体，可能提供improved稳定性或选择性。

6. 过程集成：开发创新的反应器设计或工艺配置，可以减轻催化剂失活或提高整体过程效率。

通过关注这些领域，研究人员可能能够克服N2O-ODHP当前的限制，使其成为更可行的工业丙烯生产选择。
