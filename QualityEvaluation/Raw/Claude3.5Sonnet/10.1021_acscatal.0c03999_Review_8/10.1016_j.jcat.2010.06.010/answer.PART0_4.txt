[1] "When using nitrous oxide instead of molecular oxygen as oxidizing agent, propene selectivity was also significantly improved over steam-activated iron-containing zeolites [19], bulk vanadium oxides [20] and supported vanadium-containing materials [13,2123]."

[2] "Based on a kinetic analysis of the ODP reaction [13,14,25], the positive effect of N2O on the ODP reaction was explained as follows. In contrast to O2, reoxidation of reduced VOx species is slower with N2O, resulting in a lower steady-state concentration of active lattice oxygen sites. As a consequence, consecutive oxidation of propene to carbon oxides is suppressed."

[3] "A turnover frequency of propane conversion of 0:016 molC3H8 mol1V s1 has been measured with O2 used as oxidizing agent. In comparison, the respective value with N2O was only half as high, while the propene selectivity was higher, amounting to 80% with N2O but only to 50% with O2 at propane conversion of approximately 10%."

[4] "The higher activity but lower propene selectivity with O2 might be due to the formation of OxV5+  O2, OxV5    O22 , and Vn+  O. The latter species was experimentally proven to be very active, reacting with propane partially and with propene even completely already at room temperature."

[5] "In contrast, such highly reactive species are not formed with N2O. In this case, the reaction probably proceeds by participation of nucleophilic oxide ions. This might also be the reason for the higher propene selectivity in the ODP reaction with N2O."

Nitrous oxide (N2O) has shown advantages as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) compared to other oxidants, particularly in terms of propylene selectivity. The use of N2O as an oxidizing agent has demonstrated significantly improved propene selectivity over various catalysts, including steam-activated iron-containing zeolites, bulk vanadium oxides, and supported vanadium-containing materials.

The improved selectivity with N2O can be attributed to its slower reoxidation of reduced VOx species compared to O2. This results in a lower steady-state concentration of active lattice oxygen sites, which suppresses the consecutive oxidation of propene to carbon oxides. Experimental results have shown that while the turnover frequency of propane conversion with N2O is about half that of O2, the propene selectivity is significantly higher - 80% with N2O compared to only 50% with O2 at approximately 10% propane conversion.

The higher activity but lower propene selectivity observed with O2 is likely due to the formation of highly reactive oxygen species such as OxV5+  O2, OxV5    O22 , and Vn+  O. These species, particularly Vn+  O, have been experimentally proven to be very active, reacting with propane partially and with propene completely even at room temperature. In contrast, these highly reactive species are not formed with N2O. Instead, the reaction with N2O likely proceeds through the participation of nucleophilic oxide ions, which contributes to the higher propene selectivity.

While the literature does not explicitly discuss catalyst deactivation and stability challenges specific to N2O-ODHP, some potential research directions can be proposed:

1. Catalyst design: Develop catalysts that can maintain high selectivity while increasing activity with N2O.

2. Reaction mechanism studies: Further investigate the reaction pathways and intermediates formed with N2O to optimize catalyst performance.

3. Process engineering: Explore ways to improve N2O utilization efficiency and develop methods for its regeneration or recycling.

4. Hybrid systems: Investigate the potential of combining N2O with other oxidants or reaction conditions to balance activity and selectivity.

5. Long-term stability studies: Conduct extended trials to assess catalyst stability and identify deactivation mechanisms specific to N2O-ODHP.

6. Economic and environmental analysis: Evaluate the overall feasibility of N2O-ODHP, considering factors such as N2O production costs and its environmental impact.

By addressing these areas, researchers could potentially overcome the limitations of N2O-ODHP and make it a more viable option for practical implementation.

与其他氧化剂相比，一氧化二氮（N2O）作为氧化剂在丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）中显示出优势，特别是在丙烯选择性方面。使用N2O作为氧化剂在各种催化剂上都显示出显著提高的丙烯选择性，包括蒸汽活化的含铁沸石、大体积钒氧化物和负载型含钒材料。

N2O改善选择性的原因可归因于其与O2相比，对还原态VOx物种的再氧化速度较慢。这导致活性晶格氧位点的稳态浓度较低，从而抑制了丙烯连续氧化成碳氧化物的过程。实验结果表明，虽然N2O的丙烷转化频率约为O2的一半，但丙烯选择性显著提高 - 在约10%的丙烷转化率下，N2O的丙烯选择性为80%，而O2仅为50%。

O2表现出的较高活性但较低丙烯选择性可能是由于形成了高活性氧物种，如OxV5+  O2、OxV5    O22 和Vn+  O。这些物种，特别是Vn+  O，已被实验证明具有很高的活性，即使在室温下也能部分与丙烷反应，并与丙烯完全反应。相比之下，N2O不会形成这些高活性物种。相反，N2O的反应可能是通过亲核氧化物离子的参与进行的，这也是导致更高丙烯选择性的原因。

虽然文献中没有明确讨论N2O-ODHP特有的催化剂失活和稳定性挑战，但可以提出一些潜在的研究方向：

1. 催化剂设计：开发能够在使用N2O时保持高选择性同时提高活性的催化剂。

2. 反应机理研究：进一步研究N2O形成的反应途径和中间体，以优化催化剂性能。

3. 工艺工程：探索提高N2O利用效率的方法，并开发其再生或回收的方法。

4. 混合系统：研究将N2O与其他氧化剂或反应条件结合的潜力，以平衡活性和选择性。

5. 长期稳定性研究：进行延长试验以评估催化剂稳定性，并识别N2O-ODHP特有的失活机制。

6. 经济和环境分析：评估N2O-ODHP的整体可行性，考虑N2O生产成本和环境影响等因素。

通过解决这些领域的问题，研究人员可能克服N2O-ODHP的限制，使其成为更可行的实际应用选择。
