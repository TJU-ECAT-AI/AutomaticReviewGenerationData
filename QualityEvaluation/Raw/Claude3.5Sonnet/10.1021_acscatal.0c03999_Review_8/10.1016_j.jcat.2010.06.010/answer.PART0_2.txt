[1] "When using nitrous oxide instead of molecular oxygen as oxidizing agent, propene selectivity was also significantly improved over steam-activated iron-containing zeolites [19], bulk vanadium oxides [20] and supported vanadium-containing materials [13,2123]."

[2] "Based on a kinetic analysis of the ODP reaction [13,14,25], the positive effect of N2O on the ODP reaction was explained as follows. In contrast to O2, reoxidation of reduced VOx species is slower with N2O, resulting in a lower steady-state concentration of active lattice oxygen sites. As a consequence, consecutive oxidation of propene to carbon oxides is suppressed."

[3] "A turnover frequency of propane conversion of 0:016 molC3H8 mol1V s1 has been measured with O2 used as oxidizing agent. In comparison, the respective value with N2O was only half as high, while the propene selectivity was higher, amounting to 80% with N2O but only to 50% with O2 at propane conversion of approximately 10%."

[4] "The higher activity but lower propene selectivity with O2 might be due to the formation of OxV5+  O2, OxV5    O22 , and Vn+  O. The latter species was experimentally proven to be very active, reacting with propane partially and with propene even completely already at room temperature."

[5] "In contrast, such highly reactive species are not formed with N2O. In this case, the reaction probably proceeds by participation of nucleophilic oxide ions. This might also be the reason for the higher propene selectivity in the ODP reaction with N2O."

Nitrous oxide (N2O) offers significant advantages in terms of propylene selectivity compared to other oxidants like molecular oxygen (O2) in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP). The use of N2O as an oxidant has shown improved propene selectivity across various catalysts, including steam-activated iron-containing zeolites, bulk vanadium oxides, and supported vanadium-containing materials.

The key advantage of N2O lies in its slower reoxidation of reduced VOx species compared to O2. This results in a lower steady-state concentration of active lattice oxygen sites, which suppresses the consecutive oxidation of propene to carbon oxides. As a result, propene selectivity is significantly higher when using N2O as an oxidant.

In terms of catalyst performance, studies have shown that while the turnover frequency of propane conversion is lower with N2O compared to O2, the propene selectivity is substantially higher. For instance, at approximately 10% propane conversion, propene selectivity reached 80% with N2O, compared to only 50% with O2.

The improved selectivity with N2O can be attributed to the different nature of oxygen species formed on the catalyst surface. With O2, highly reactive species such as OxV5+  O2, OxV5    O22 , and Vn+  O are formed, which react rapidly with both propane and propene, leading to lower selectivity. In contrast, N2O does not form these highly reactive species. Instead, the reaction likely proceeds through nucleophilic oxide ions, resulting in higher propene selectivity.

However, the critical challenges associated with N2O-ODHP include lower activity compared to O2-based systems and potential catalyst deactivation issues. The literature does not provide specific information on catalyst stability or deactivation in N2O-ODHP systems.

To address these limitations and make N2O-ODHP more feasible for practical implementation, several research directions could be pursued:

1. Catalyst optimization: Develop catalysts that can maintain high selectivity while improving activity in N2O-based systems.

2. Understanding reaction mechanisms: Further investigate the formation and reactivity of oxygen species with N2O to optimize reaction conditions.

3. Process engineering: Explore ways to improve overall process efficiency, such as heat integration or reactor design, to compensate for the lower activity of N2O-based systems.

4. Catalyst stability studies: Conduct long-term stability tests and develop strategies to mitigate potential deactivation issues specific to N2O-ODHP.

5. Economic and environmental assessment: Evaluate the overall feasibility of N2O-ODHP considering factors such as N2O production costs and its environmental impact as a greenhouse gas.

By addressing these challenges and pursuing these research directions, N2O-ODHP could potentially become a more viable option for industrial implementation, offering a more selective route to propylene production.

在丙烷氧化脱氢(ODHP)过程中，一氧化二氮(N2O)作为氧化剂相比其他氧化剂如分子氧(O2)在丙烯选择性方面具有显著优势。N2O作为氧化剂在各种催化剂上都表现出更高的丙烯选择性，包括蒸汽活化的含铁沸石、块状钒氧化物和负载型含钒材料。

N2O的主要优势在于其对还原态VOx物种的再氧化速度比O2慢。这导致活性晶格氧位点的稳态浓度较低，从而抑制了丙烯连续氧化成碳氧化物的过程。因此，使用N2O作为氧化剂时，丙烯选择性显著提高。

在催化剂性能方面，研究表明，虽然使用N2O时丙烷转化的转化频率低于O2，但丙烯选择性显著提高。例如，在约10%的丙烷转化率下，使用N2O时丙烯选择性达到80%，而使用O2时仅为50%。

N2O改善选择性的原因可归因于催化剂表面形成的氧物种性质不同。使用O2时，会形成高活性物种如OxV5+  O2、OxV5    O22 和Vn+  O，这些物种与丙烷和丙烯都反应迅速，导致选择性降低。相比之下，N2O不形成这些高活性物种。反应可能通过亲核氧离子进行，从而获得更高的丙烯选择性。

然而，N2O-ODHP面临的关键挑战包括与O2体系相比活性较低，以及潜在的催化剂失活问题。文献中没有提供关于N2O-ODHP系统中催化剂稳定性或失活的具体信息。

为了解决这些限制并使N2O-ODHP更适合实际应用，可以pursued以下几个研究方向：

1. 催化剂优化：开发能在N2O体系中保持高选择性同时提高活性的催化剂。

2. 理解反应机理：进一步研究N2O形成和反应的氧物种，以优化反应条件。

3. 过程工程：探索提高整体过程效率的方法，如热集成或反应器设计，以弥补N2O体系活性较低的缺点。

4. 催化剂稳定性研究：进行长期稳定性测试，并开发策略以缓解N2O-ODHP特有的潜在失活问题。

5. 经济和环境评估：考虑N2O生产成本及其作为温室气体的环境影响等因素，评估N2O-ODHP的整体可行性。

通过解决这些挑战并pursued这些研究方向，N2O-ODHP有潜力成为更可行的工业应用选择，为丙烯生产提供一种选择性更高的路径。
