[1] "When using nitrous oxide instead of molecular oxygen as oxidizing agent, propene selectivity was also significantly improved over steam-activated iron-containing zeolites [19], bulk vanadium oxides [20] and supported vanadium-containing materials [13,2123]."

[2] "Based on a kinetic analysis of the ODP reaction [13,14,25], the positive effect of N2O on the ODP reaction was explained as follows. In contrast to O2, reoxidation of reduced VOx species is slower with N2O, resulting in a lower steady-state concentration of active lattice oxygen sites. As a consequence, consecutive oxidation of propene to carbon oxides is suppressed."

[3] "A turnover frequency of propane conversion of 0:016 molC3H8 mol1V s1 has been measured with O2 used as oxidizing agent. In comparison, the respective value with N2O was only half as high, while the propene selectivity was higher, amounting to 80% with N2O but only to 50% with O2 at propane conversion of approximately 10%."

[4] "The higher activity but lower propene selectivity with O2 might be due to the formation of OxV5+  O2, OxV5    O22 , and Vn+  O. The latter species was experimentally proven to be very active, reacting with propane partially and with propene even completely already at room temperature."

[5] "In contrast, such highly reactive species are not formed with N2O. In this case, the reaction probably proceeds by participation of nucleophilic oxide ions. This might also be the reason for the higher propene selectivity in the ODP reaction with N2O."

Nitrous oxide (N2O) has shown advantages as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) compared to other oxidants, particularly in terms of propylene selectivity. The literature indicates that N2O significantly improves propene selectivity over various catalysts, including steam-activated iron-containing zeolites, bulk vanadium oxides, and supported vanadium-containing materials.

The main advantage of using N2O lies in its slower reoxidation of reduced VOx species compared to O2. This results in a lower steady-state concentration of active lattice oxygen sites, which suppresses the consecutive oxidation of propene to carbon oxides. Experimental results show that while the turnover frequency of propane conversion with N2O is about half that of O2, the propene selectivity is significantly higher (80% with N2O vs. 50% with O2 at approximately 10% propane conversion).

The higher selectivity with N2O is attributed to the absence of highly reactive oxygen species that are formed when using O2 as the oxidant. With O2, species such as OxV5+  O2, OxV5    O22 , and Vn+  O are formed, which are very active and react with both propane and propene even at room temperature. In contrast, N2O likely proceeds through nucleophilic oxide ions, leading to higher propene selectivity.

While the literature doesn't explicitly discuss catalyst deactivation and stability challenges specific to N2O-ODHP, these are common issues in catalytic processes. To address these limitations and make N2O-ODHP more feasible for practical implementation, several research directions could be pursued:

1. Catalyst design: Develop catalysts that maintain high selectivity while increasing activity, possibly through novel support materials or promoters.

2. Mechanistic studies: Further investigate the reaction mechanism with N2O to optimize catalyst formulations and reaction conditions.

3. Stability enhancement: Research into improving catalyst stability and resistance to deactivation, potentially through the use of more robust support materials or advanced synthesis techniques.

4. Process engineering: Explore innovative reactor designs or process configurations that could enhance heat management and improve overall efficiency.

5. Economic and environmental assessment: Conduct comprehensive studies on the economic viability and environmental impact of N2O-ODHP compared to conventional processes.

6. N2O production and handling: Investigate more efficient and sustainable methods for N2O production and its safe handling in industrial settings.

By addressing these areas, researchers could potentially overcome the current limitations and make N2O-ODHP a more attractive option for industrial implementation.

一氧化二氮（N2O）作为氧化剂在丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）中相比其他氧化剂显示出优势，特别是在丙烯选择性方面。文献表明，N2O在各种催化剂上显著提高了丙烯选择性，包括蒸汽活化的含铁沸石、体相钒氧化物和负载型含钒材料。

使用N2O的主要优势在于它相对于O2更缓慢地重氧化还原的VOx物种。这导致活性晶格氧位点的稳态浓度较低，从而抑制了丙烯连续氧化为碳氧化物的过程。实验结果显示，虽然使用N2O时丙烷转化的转化频率约为O2的一半，但丙烯选择性显著提高（在约10%的丙烷转化率下，N2O为80%，而O2为50%）。

N2O的高选择性归因于没有形成使用O2作为氧化剂时产生的高活性氧物种。使用O2时，会形成如OxV5+  O2, OxV5    O22 和Vn+  O等物种，这些物种非常活跃，甚至在室温下就能与丙烷和丙烯反应。相比之下，N2O可能通过亲核氧离子进行反应，从而导致更高的丙烯选择性。

虽然文献中没有明确讨论N2O-ODHP特有的催化剂失活和稳定性挑战，但这些是催化过程中常见的问题。为了解决这些限制并使N2O-ODHP更加可行，可以追求以下几个研究方向：

1. 催化剂设计：开发在保持高选择性的同时提高活性的催化剂，可能通过新型载体材料或助剂实现。

2. 机理研究：进一步研究N2O的反应机理，以优化催化剂配方和反应条件。

3. 稳定性增强：研究提高催化剂稳定性和抗失活能力的方法，可能通过使用更坚固的载体材料或先进的合成技术。

4. 过程工程：探索创新的反应器设计或过程配置，以增强热管理和提高整体效率。

5. 经济和环境评估：对比常规工艺，对N2O-ODHP的经济可行性和环境影响进行全面研究。

6. N2O生产和处理：研究更高效和可持续的N2O生产方法，以及在工业环境中安全处理N2O的方法。

通过解决这些领域的问题，研究人员有可能克服当前的限制，使N2O-ODHP成为更具吸引力的工业实施选择。
