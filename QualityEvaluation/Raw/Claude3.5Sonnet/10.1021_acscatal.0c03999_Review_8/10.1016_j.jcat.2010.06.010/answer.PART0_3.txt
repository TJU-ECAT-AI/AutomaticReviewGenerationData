[1] "When using nitrous oxide instead of molecular oxygen as oxidizing agent, propene selectivity was also significantly improved over steam-activated iron-containing zeolites [19], bulk vanadium oxides [20] and supported vanadium-containing materials [13,2123]."

[2] "Based on a kinetic analysis of the ODP reaction [13,14,25], the positive effect of N2O on the ODP reaction was explained as follows. In contrast to O2, reoxidation of reduced VOx species is slower with N2O, resulting in a lower steady-state concentration of active lattice oxygen sites. As a consequence, consecutive oxidation of propene to carbon oxides is suppressed."

[3] "A turnover frequency of propane conversion of 0:016 molC3H8 mol1V s1 has been measured with O2 used as oxidizing agent. In comparison, the respective value with N2O was only half as high, while the propene selectivity was higher, amounting to 80% with N2O but only to 50% with O2 at propane conversion of approximately 10%."

[4] "The higher activity and lower selectivity observed in the ODH of propane with O2 in comparison with N2O is attributed to the presence of highly reactive electrophilic O species in the former case (which preferentially burn propene), while nucleophilic, less active but more selective O2 ions serve as reactants in ODH of propane with N2O."

The use of nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) offers significant advantages in terms of propylene selectivity compared to other oxidants, particularly molecular oxygen (O2). 

N2O improves propene selectivity across various catalysts, including steam-activated iron-containing zeolites, bulk vanadium oxides, and supported vanadium-containing materials. The improved selectivity is attributed to the slower reoxidation of reduced VOx species with N2O compared to O2, resulting in a lower steady-state concentration of active lattice oxygen sites. This suppresses the consecutive oxidation of propene to carbon oxides.

In a specific example with VOx/MCM-41 catalyst, N2O showed 80% propene selectivity compared to only 50% with O2 at approximately 10% propane conversion. However, the turnover frequency of propane conversion with N2O was only half that of O2, indicating lower activity.

The higher selectivity with N2O is attributed to the formation of nucleophilic, less active but more selective O2- ions, in contrast to the highly reactive electrophilic O- species formed with O2, which preferentially oxidize propene to COx.

While the literature doesn't explicitly discuss catalyst deactivation and stability challenges specific to N2O-ODHP, addressing the lower activity of N2O compared to O2 is crucial for practical implementation. 

To make N2O-ODHP more feasible, research could focus on:

1. Catalyst design: Developing catalysts that maintain high selectivity while increasing activity with N2O.

2. Process optimization: Exploring reaction conditions (temperature, pressure, contact time) that maximize propylene yield without compromising selectivity.

3. N2O activation: Investigating methods to enhance N2O reactivity without losing its selectivity advantage.

4. Hybrid systems: Exploring the use of N2O in combination with other oxidants or in multi-step processes to balance activity and selectivity.

5. In-situ characterization: Conducting more detailed studies on the nature and reactivity of oxygen species formed from N2O on various catalysts to guide catalyst design.

6. Economic and environmental assessment: Evaluating the overall feasibility of N2O-ODHP, considering N2O production costs and its environmental impact as a greenhouse gas.

These strategies could potentially address the limitations of N2O-ODHP and make it a more viable option for industrial implementation.

在氧化脱氢丙烷（ODHP）反应中使用一氧化二氮（N2O）作为氧化剂与其他氧化剂相比，在丙烯选择性方面具有显著优势。

N2O能够提高多种催化剂的丙烯选择性，包括蒸汽活化的含铁分子筛、块状钒氧化物和负载型含钒材料。这种选择性的提高归因于N2O与O2相比，对还原态VOx物种的再氧化速度较慢，导致活性晶格氧位点的稳态浓度较低。这抑制了丙烯向碳氧化物的连续氧化。

在一个使用VOx/MCM-41催化剂的具体例子中，在约10%的丙烷转化率下，N2O显示出80%的丙烯选择性，而O2仅为50%。然而，使用N2O时丙烷转化的转换频率仅为O2的一半，表明活性较低。

N2O的高选择性归因于形成亲核性、活性较低但选择性更高的O2-离子，而O2形成的高活性亲电性O-物种倾向于将丙烯氧化为COx。

虽然文献没有明确讨论N2O-ODHP特有的催化剂失活和稳定性挑战，但解决N2O相比O2活性较低的问题对于实际应用至关重要。

为使N2O-ODHP更具可行性，研究可以集中在以下方面：

1. 催化剂设计：开发在使用N2O时保持高选择性同时提高活性的催化剂。

2. 过程优化：探索能在不影响选择性的情况下最大化丙烯产率的反应条件（温度、压力、接触时间）。

3. N2O活化：研究提高N2O反应性而不损失其选择性优势的方法。

4. 混合系统：探索N2O与其他氧化剂的组合使用或多步骤过程，以平衡活性和选择性。

5. 原位表征：对各种催化剂上N2O形成的氧物种的性质和反应性进行更详细的研究，以指导催化剂设计。

6. 经济和环境评估：评估N2O-ODHP的整体可行性，考虑N2O的生产成本及其作为温室气体的环境影响。

这些策略可能解决N2O-ODHP的局限性，使其成为更可行的工业应用选择。
