[1] "When using nitrous oxide instead of molecular oxygen as oxidizing agent, propene selectivity was also significantly improved over steam-activated iron-containing zeolites [19], bulk vanadium oxides [20] and supported vanadium-containing materials [13,2123]."

[2] "Based on a kinetic analysis of the ODP reaction [13,14,25], the positive effect of N2O on the ODP reaction was explained as follows. In contrast to O2, reoxidation of reduced VOx species is slower with N2O, resulting in a lower steady-state concentration of active lattice oxygen sites. As a consequence, consecutive oxidation of propene to carbon oxides is suppressed."

[3] "A turnover frequency of propane conversion of 0:016 molC3H8 mol1V s1 has been measured with O2 used as oxidizing agent. In comparison, the respective value with N2O was only half as high, while the propene selectivity was higher, amounting to 80% with N2O but only to 50% with O2 at propane conversion of approximately 10%."

[4] "The higher activity but lower propene selectivity with O2 might be due to the formation of OxV5+  O2, OxV5    O22 , and Vn+  O. The latter species was experimentally proven to be very active, reacting with propane partially and with propene even completely already at room temperature."

[5] "In contrast, such highly reactive species are not formed with N2O. In this case, the reaction probably proceeds by participation of nucleophilic oxide ions. This might also be the reason for the higher propene selectivity in the ODP reaction with N2O."

The use of nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) offers several advantages in terms of propylene selectivity compared to other oxidants, particularly molecular oxygen (O2):

1. Improved propene selectivity: N2O significantly enhances propene selectivity across various catalysts, including steam-activated iron-containing zeolites, bulk vanadium oxides, and supported vanadium-containing materials.

2. Slower reoxidation rate: N2O reoxidizes reduced VOx species more slowly than O2, resulting in a lower steady-state concentration of active lattice oxygen sites. This suppresses the consecutive oxidation of propene to carbon oxides, thereby improving selectivity.

3. Higher propene selectivity at similar conversion: With N2O, propene selectivity can reach 80% compared to only 50% with O2 at approximately 10% propane conversion.

4. Formation of less reactive oxygen species: N2O does not form highly reactive species like OxV5+  O2, OxV5    O22, and Vn+  O, which are responsible for the lower selectivity observed with O2. Instead, N2O likely proceeds through nucleophilic oxide ions, contributing to higher propene selectivity.

However, the use of N2O also presents some challenges:

1. Lower activity: The turnover frequency of propane conversion with N2O is only half that of O2, indicating lower overall activity.

2. Catalyst stability and deactivation: While not explicitly mentioned in the given literature, catalyst stability and deactivation are often critical challenges in ODHP processes and likely apply to N2O-based systems as well.

To address these limitations and make N2O-ODHP more feasible for practical implementation, the following strategies and research directions could be pursued:

1. Catalyst optimization: Develop catalysts that can maintain high selectivity while improving activity with N2O as the oxidant.

2. Mixed oxidant systems: Investigate the use of N2O in combination with other oxidants to balance activity and selectivity.

3. Process intensification: Explore reactor designs and operating conditions that can enhance the efficiency of N2O utilization and improve overall process economics.

4. Catalyst stability studies: Conduct long-term stability tests and develop strategies to mitigate catalyst deactivation in N2O-ODHP systems.

5. Mechanistic studies: Further investigate the reaction mechanisms and oxygen species formed with N2O to guide catalyst design and process optimization.

6. Economic and environmental assessment: Evaluate the overall feasibility of N2O-ODHP, considering factors such as N2O production, handling, and potential environmental impacts.

By addressing these challenges and pursuing these research directions, N2O-ODHP could potentially become a more viable option for industrial implementation, offering a selective route to produce propylene from propane.

使用一氧化二氮（N2O）作为氧化剂在丙烷的氧化脱氢（ODHP）过程中，相比其他氧化剂，特别是分子氧（O2），在丙烯选择性方面提供了几个优势：

1. 提高丙烯选择性：N2O显著提高了各种催化剂的丙烯选择性，包括蒸汽活化的含铁沸石、块状钒氧化物和负载型含钒材料。

2. 较慢的再氧化速率：N2O比O2更缓慢地再氧化还原态的VOx物种，导致活性晶格氧位点的稳态浓度较低。这抑制了丙烯连续氧化为碳氧化物的过程，从而提高了选择性。

3. 在相似转化率下更高的丙烯选择性：在约10%的丙烷转化率下，使用N2O可达到80%的丙烯选择性，而使用O2只能达到50%。

4. 形成反应性较低的氧物种：N2O不会形成高反应性物种，如OxV5+  O2、OxV5    O22和Vn+  O，这些物种是使用O2时观察到的较低选择性的原因。相反，N2O可能通过亲核氧化物离子进行反应，从而贡献了更高的丙烯选择性。

然而，使用N2O也存在一些挑战：

1. 较低的活性：使用N2O时，丙烷转化的转换频率仅为使用O2时的一半，表明整体活性较低。

2. 催化剂稳定性和失活：虽然在给定的文献中没有明确提到，但催化剂稳定性和失活通常是ODHP过程中的关键挑战，可能也适用于基于N2O的系统。

为了解决这些限制并使N2O-ODHP更适合实际应用，可以采取以下策略和研究方向：

1. 催化剂优化：开发能够在使用N2O作为氧化剂时保持高选择性同时提高活性的催化剂。

2. 混合氧化剂系统：研究将N2O与其他氧化剂结合使用，以平衡活性和选择性。

3. 过程强化：探索能够提高N2O利用效率并改善整体过程经济性的反应器设计和操作条件。

4. 催化剂稳定性研究：进行长期稳定性测试，并开发策略以减轻N2O-ODHP系统中的催化剂失活。

5. 机理研究：进一步研究N2O形成的反应机理和氧物种，以指导催化剂设计和过程优化。

6. 经济和环境评估：评估N2O-ODHP的整体可行性，考虑N2O生产、处理和潜在环境影响等因素。

通过解决这些挑战并追求这些研究方向，N2O-ODHP可能成为工业实施的更可行选择，为从丙烷生产丙烯提供一种选择性路径。
