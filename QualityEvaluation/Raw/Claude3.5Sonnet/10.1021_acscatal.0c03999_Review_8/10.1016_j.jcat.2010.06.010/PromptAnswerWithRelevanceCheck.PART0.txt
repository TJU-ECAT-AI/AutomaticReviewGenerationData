The use of nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) offers several advantages in terms of propylene selectivity compared to other oxidants, particularly molecular oxygen (O2):

1. Improved propene selectivity: N2O significantly enhances propene selectivity across various catalysts, including steam-activated iron-containing zeolites, bulk vanadium oxides, and supported vanadium-containing materials.

2. Slower reoxidation rate: N2O reoxidizes reduced VOx species more slowly than O2, resulting in a lower steady-state concentration of active lattice oxygen sites. This suppresses the consecutive oxidation of propene to carbon oxides, thereby improving selectivity.

3. Higher propene selectivity at similar conversion: With N2O, propene selectivity can reach 80% compared to only 50% with O2 at approximately 10% propane conversion.

4. Formation of less reactive oxygen species: N2O does not form highly reactive species like OxV5+  O2, OxV5    O22, and Vn+  O, which are responsible for the lower selectivity observed with O2. Instead, N2O likely proceeds through nucleophilic oxide ions, contributing to higher propene selectivity.

However, the use of N2O also presents some challenges:

1. Lower activity: The turnover frequency of propane conversion with N2O is only half that of O2, indicating lower overall activity.

2. Catalyst stability and deactivation: While not explicitly mentioned in the given literature, catalyst stability and deactivation are often critical challenges in ODHP processes and likely apply to N2O-based systems as well.

To address these limitations and make N2O-ODHP more feasible for practical implementation, the following strategies and research directions could be pursued:

1. Catalyst optimization: Develop catalysts that can maintain high selectivity while improving activity with N2O as the oxidant.

2. Mixed oxidant systems: Investigate the use of N2O in combination with other oxidants to balance activity and selectivity.

3. Process intensification: Explore reactor designs and operating conditions that can enhance the efficiency of N2O utilization and improve overall process economics.

4. Catalyst stability studies: Conduct long-term stability tests and develop strategies to mitigate catalyst deactivation in N2O-ODHP systems.

5. Mechanistic studies: Further investigate the reaction mechanisms and oxygen species formed with N2O to guide catalyst design and process optimization.

6. Economic and environmental assessment: Evaluate the overall feasibility of N2O-ODHP, considering factors such as N2O production, handling, and potential environmental impacts.

By addressing these challenges and pursuing these research directions, N2O-ODHP could potentially become a more viable option for industrial implementation, offering a selective route to produce propylene from propane.

使用一氧化二氮（N2O）作为氧化剂在丙烷的氧化脱氢（ODHP）过程中，相比其他氧化剂，特别是分子氧（O2），在丙烯选择性方面提供了几个优势：

1. 提高丙烯选择性：N2O显著提高了各种催化剂的丙烯选择性，包括蒸汽活化的含铁沸石、块状钒氧化物和负载型含钒材料。

2. 较慢的再氧化速率：N2O比O2更缓慢地再氧化还原态的VOx物种，导致活性晶格氧位点的稳态浓度较低。这抑制了丙烯连续氧化为碳氧化物的过程，从而提高了选择性。

3. 在相似转化率下更高的丙烯选择性：在约10%的丙烷转化率下，使用N2O可达到80%的丙烯选择性，而使用O2只能达到50%。

4. 形成反应性较低的氧物种：N2O不会形成高反应性物种，如OxV5+  O2、OxV5    O22和Vn+  O，这些物种是使用O2时观察到的较低选择性的原因。相反，N2O可能通过亲核氧化物离子进行反应，从而贡献了更高的丙烯选择性。

然而，使用N2O也存在一些挑战：

1. 较低的活性：使用N2O时，丙烷转化的转换频率仅为使用O2时的一半，表明整体活性较低。

2. 催化剂稳定性和失活：虽然在给定的文献中没有明确提到，但催化剂稳定性和失活通常是ODHP过程中的关键挑战，可能也适用于基于N2O的系统。

为了解决这些限制并使N2O-ODHP更适合实际应用，可以采取以下策略和研究方向：

1. 催化剂优化：开发能够在使用N2O作为氧化剂时保持高选择性同时提高活性的催化剂。

2. 混合氧化剂系统：研究将N2O与其他氧化剂结合使用，以平衡活性和选择性。

3. 过程强化：探索能够提高N2O利用效率并改善整体过程经济性的反应器设计和操作条件。

4. 催化剂稳定性研究：进行长期稳定性测试，并开发策略以减轻N2O-ODHP系统中的催化剂失活。

5. 机理研究：进一步研究N2O形成的反应机理和氧物种，以指导催化剂设计和过程优化。

6. 经济和环境评估：评估N2O-ODHP的整体可行性，考虑N2O生产、处理和潜在环境影响等因素。

通过解决这些挑战并追求这些研究方向，N2O-ODHP可能成为工业实施的更可行选择，为从丙烷生产丙烯提供一种选择性路径。

Nitrous oxide (N2O) has shown advantages as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) compared to other oxidants, particularly in terms of propylene selectivity. The literature indicates that N2O significantly improves propene selectivity over various catalysts, including steam-activated iron-containing zeolites, bulk vanadium oxides, and supported vanadium-containing materials.

The main advantage of using N2O lies in its slower reoxidation of reduced VOx species compared to O2. This results in a lower steady-state concentration of active lattice oxygen sites, which suppresses the consecutive oxidation of propene to carbon oxides. Experimental results show that while the turnover frequency of propane conversion with N2O is about half that of O2, the propene selectivity is significantly higher (80% with N2O vs. 50% with O2 at approximately 10% propane conversion).

The higher selectivity with N2O is attributed to the absence of highly reactive oxygen species that are formed when using O2 as the oxidant. With O2, species such as OxV5+  O2, OxV5    O22 , and Vn+  O are formed, which are very active and react with both propane and propene even at room temperature. In contrast, N2O likely proceeds through nucleophilic oxide ions, leading to higher propene selectivity.

While the literature doesn't explicitly discuss catalyst deactivation and stability challenges specific to N2O-ODHP, these are common issues in catalytic processes. To address these limitations and make N2O-ODHP more feasible for practical implementation, several research directions could be pursued:

1. Catalyst design: Develop catalysts that maintain high selectivity while increasing activity, possibly through novel support materials or promoters.

2. Mechanistic studies: Further investigate the reaction mechanism with N2O to optimize catalyst formulations and reaction conditions.

3. Stability enhancement: Research into improving catalyst stability and resistance to deactivation, potentially through the use of more robust support materials or advanced synthesis techniques.

4. Process engineering: Explore innovative reactor designs or process configurations that could enhance heat management and improve overall efficiency.

5. Economic and environmental assessment: Conduct comprehensive studies on the economic viability and environmental impact of N2O-ODHP compared to conventional processes.

6. N2O production and handling: Investigate more efficient and sustainable methods for N2O production and its safe handling in industrial settings.

By addressing these areas, researchers could potentially overcome the current limitations and make N2O-ODHP a more attractive option for industrial implementation.

一氧化二氮（N2O）作为氧化剂在丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）中相比其他氧化剂显示出优势，特别是在丙烯选择性方面。文献表明，N2O在各种催化剂上显著提高了丙烯选择性，包括蒸汽活化的含铁沸石、体相钒氧化物和负载型含钒材料。

使用N2O的主要优势在于它相对于O2更缓慢地重氧化还原的VOx物种。这导致活性晶格氧位点的稳态浓度较低，从而抑制了丙烯连续氧化为碳氧化物的过程。实验结果显示，虽然使用N2O时丙烷转化的转化频率约为O2的一半，但丙烯选择性显著提高（在约10%的丙烷转化率下，N2O为80%，而O2为50%）。

N2O的高选择性归因于没有形成使用O2作为氧化剂时产生的高活性氧物种。使用O2时，会形成如OxV5+  O2, OxV5    O22 和Vn+  O等物种，这些物种非常活跃，甚至在室温下就能与丙烷和丙烯反应。相比之下，N2O可能通过亲核氧离子进行反应，从而导致更高的丙烯选择性。

虽然文献中没有明确讨论N2O-ODHP特有的催化剂失活和稳定性挑战，但这些是催化过程中常见的问题。为了解决这些限制并使N2O-ODHP更加可行，可以追求以下几个研究方向：

1. 催化剂设计：开发在保持高选择性的同时提高活性的催化剂，可能通过新型载体材料或助剂实现。

2. 机理研究：进一步研究N2O的反应机理，以优化催化剂配方和反应条件。

3. 稳定性增强：研究提高催化剂稳定性和抗失活能力的方法，可能通过使用更坚固的载体材料或先进的合成技术。

4. 过程工程：探索创新的反应器设计或过程配置，以增强热管理和提高整体效率。

5. 经济和环境评估：对比常规工艺，对N2O-ODHP的经济可行性和环境影响进行全面研究。

6. N2O生产和处理：研究更高效和可持续的N2O生产方法，以及在工业环境中安全处理N2O的方法。

通过解决这些领域的问题，研究人员有可能克服当前的限制，使N2O-ODHP成为更具吸引力的工业实施选择。

The key advantage of N2O lies in its slower reoxidation of reduced VOx species compared to O2. This results in a lower steady-state concentration of active lattice oxygen sites, which suppresses the consecutive oxidation of propene to carbon oxides. As a result, propene selectivity is significantly higher when using N2O as an oxidant.

In terms of catalyst performance, studies have shown that while the turnover frequency of propane conversion is lower with N2O compared to O2, the propene selectivity is substantially higher. For instance, at approximately 10% propane conversion, propene selectivity reached 80% with N2O, compared to only 50% with O2.

The improved selectivity with N2O can be attributed to the different nature of oxygen species formed on the catalyst surface. With O2, highly reactive species such as OxV5+  O2, OxV5    O22 , and Vn+  O are formed, which react rapidly with both propane and propene, leading to lower selectivity. In contrast, N2O does not form these highly reactive species. Instead, the reaction likely proceeds through nucleophilic oxide ions, resulting in higher propene selectivity.

However, the critical challenges associated with N2O-ODHP include lower activity compared to O2-based systems and potential catalyst deactivation issues. The literature does not provide specific information on catalyst stability or deactivation in N2O-ODHP systems.

To address these limitations and make N2O-ODHP more feasible for practical implementation, several research directions could be pursued:

1. Catalyst optimization: Develop catalysts that can maintain high selectivity while improving activity in N2O-based systems.

2. Understanding reaction mechanisms: Further investigate the formation and reactivity of oxygen species with N2O to optimize reaction conditions.

3. Process engineering: Explore ways to improve overall process efficiency, such as heat integration or reactor design, to compensate for the lower activity of N2O-based systems.

4. Catalyst stability studies: Conduct long-term stability tests and develop strategies to mitigate potential deactivation issues specific to N2O-ODHP.

5. Economic and environmental assessment: Evaluate the overall feasibility of N2O-ODHP considering factors such as N2O production costs and its environmental impact as a greenhouse gas.

By addressing these challenges and pursuing these research directions, N2O-ODHP could potentially become a more viable option for industrial implementation, offering a more selective route to propylene production.

在催化剂性能方面，研究表明，虽然使用N2O时丙烷转化的转化频率低于O2，但丙烯选择性显著提高。例如，在约10%的丙烷转化率下，使用N2O时丙烯选择性达到80%，而使用O2时仅为50%。

N2O改善选择性的原因可归因于催化剂表面形成的氧物种性质不同。使用O2时，会形成高活性物种如OxV5+  O2、OxV5    O22 和Vn+  O，这些物种与丙烷和丙烯都反应迅速，导致选择性降低。相比之下，N2O不形成这些高活性物种。反应可能通过亲核氧离子进行，从而获得更高的丙烯选择性。

然而，N2O-ODHP面临的关键挑战包括与O2体系相比活性较低，以及潜在的催化剂失活问题。文献中没有提供关于N2O-ODHP系统中催化剂稳定性或失活的具体信息。

N2O improves propene selectivity across various catalysts, including steam-activated iron-containing zeolites, bulk vanadium oxides, and supported vanadium-containing materials. The improved selectivity is attributed to the slower reoxidation of reduced VOx species with N2O compared to O2, resulting in a lower steady-state concentration of active lattice oxygen sites. This suppresses the consecutive oxidation of propene to carbon oxides.

In a specific example with VOx/MCM-41 catalyst, N2O showed 80% propene selectivity compared to only 50% with O2 at approximately 10% propane conversion. However, the turnover frequency of propane conversion with N2O was only half that of O2, indicating lower activity.

The higher selectivity with N2O is attributed to the formation of nucleophilic, less active but more selective O2- ions, in contrast to the highly reactive electrophilic O- species formed with O2, which preferentially oxidize propene to COx.

While the literature doesn't explicitly discuss catalyst deactivation and stability challenges specific to N2O-ODHP, addressing the lower activity of N2O compared to O2 is crucial for practical implementation. 

To make N2O-ODHP more feasible, research could focus on:

1. Catalyst design: Developing catalysts that maintain high selectivity while increasing activity with N2O.

2. Process optimization: Exploring reaction conditions (temperature, pressure, contact time) that maximize propylene yield without compromising selectivity.

3. N2O activation: Investigating methods to enhance N2O reactivity without losing its selectivity advantage.

4. Hybrid systems: Exploring the use of N2O in combination with other oxidants or in multi-step processes to balance activity and selectivity.

5. In-situ characterization: Conducting more detailed studies on the nature and reactivity of oxygen species formed from N2O on various catalysts to guide catalyst design.

6. Economic and environmental assessment: Evaluating the overall feasibility of N2O-ODHP, considering N2O production costs and its environmental impact as a greenhouse gas.

These strategies could potentially address the limitations of N2O-ODHP and make it a more viable option for industrial implementation.

在氧化脱氢丙烷（ODHP）反应中使用一氧化二氮（N2O）作为氧化剂与其他氧化剂相比，在丙烯选择性方面具有显著优势。

N2O能够提高多种催化剂的丙烯选择性，包括蒸汽活化的含铁分子筛、块状钒氧化物和负载型含钒材料。这种选择性的提高归因于N2O与O2相比，对还原态VOx物种的再氧化速度较慢，导致活性晶格氧位点的稳态浓度较低。这抑制了丙烯向碳氧化物的连续氧化。

在一个使用VOx/MCM-41催化剂的具体例子中，在约10%的丙烷转化率下，N2O显示出80%的丙烯选择性，而O2仅为50%。然而，使用N2O时丙烷转化的转换频率仅为O2的一半，表明活性较低。

N2O的高选择性归因于形成亲核性、活性较低但选择性更高的O2-离子，而O2形成的高活性亲电性O-物种倾向于将丙烯氧化为COx。

虽然文献没有明确讨论N2O-ODHP特有的催化剂失活和稳定性挑战，但解决N2O相比O2活性较低的问题对于实际应用至关重要。

为使N2O-ODHP更具可行性，研究可以集中在以下方面：

1. 催化剂设计：开发在使用N2O时保持高选择性同时提高活性的催化剂。

2. 过程优化：探索能在不影响选择性的情况下最大化丙烯产率的反应条件（温度、压力、接触时间）。

3. N2O活化：研究提高N2O反应性而不损失其选择性优势的方法。

4. 混合系统：探索N2O与其他氧化剂的组合使用或多步骤过程，以平衡活性和选择性。

5. 原位表征：对各种催化剂上N2O形成的氧物种的性质和反应性进行更详细的研究，以指导催化剂设计。

6. 经济和环境评估：评估N2O-ODHP的整体可行性，考虑N2O的生产成本及其作为温室气体的环境影响。

这些策略可能解决N2O-ODHP的局限性，使其成为更可行的工业应用选择。

The use of N2O as an oxidizing agent has demonstrated significantly improved propene selectivity over various catalysts, including steam-activated iron-containing zeolites, bulk vanadium oxides, and supported vanadium-containing materials.

The improved selectivity with N2O can be attributed to its slower reoxidation of reduced VOx species compared to O2.

Experimental results have shown that while the turnover frequency of propane conversion with N2O is about half that of O2, the propene selectivity is significantly higher - 80% with N2O compared to only 50% with O2 at approximately 10% propane conversion.

The higher activity but lower propene selectivity observed with O2 is likely due to the formation of highly reactive oxygen species such as OxV5+  O2, OxV5    O22 , and Vn+  O. These species, particularly Vn+  O, have been experimentally proven to be very active, reacting with propane partially and with propene completely even at room temperature. In contrast, these highly reactive species are not formed with N2O. Instead, the reaction with N2O likely proceeds through the participation of nucleophilic oxide ions, which contributes to the higher propene selectivity.

While the literature does not explicitly discuss catalyst deactivation and stability challenges specific to N2O-ODHP, some potential research directions can be proposed:

1. Catalyst design: Develop catalysts that can maintain high selectivity while increasing activity with N2O.

2. Reaction mechanism studies: Further investigate the reaction pathways and intermediates formed with N2O to optimize catalyst performance.

3. Process engineering: Explore ways to improve N2O utilization efficiency and develop methods for its regeneration or recycling.

4. Hybrid systems: Investigate the potential of combining N2O with other oxidants or reaction conditions to balance activity and selectivity.

5. Long-term stability studies: Conduct extended trials to assess catalyst stability and identify deactivation mechanisms specific to N2O-ODHP.

6. Economic and environmental analysis: Evaluate the overall feasibility of N2O-ODHP, considering factors such as N2O production costs and its environmental impact.

与其他氧化剂相比，一氧化二氮（N2O）作为氧化剂在丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）中显示出优势，特别是在丙烯选择性方面。使用N2O作为氧化剂在各种催化剂上都显示出显著提高的丙烯选择性，包括蒸汽活化的含铁沸石、大体积钒氧化物和负载型含钒材料。

N2O改善选择性的原因可归因于其与O2相比，对还原态VOx物种的再氧化速度较慢。这导致活性晶格氧位点的稳态浓度较低，从而抑制了丙烯连续氧化成碳氧化物的过程。实验结果表明，虽然N2O的丙烷转化频率约为O2的一半，但丙烯选择性显著提高 - 在约10%的丙烷转化率下，N2O的丙烯选择性为80%，而O2仅为50%。

O2表现出的较高活性但较低丙烯选择性可能是由于形成了高活性氧物种，如OxV5+  O2、OxV5    O22 和Vn+  O。这些物种，特别是Vn+  O，已被实验证明具有很高的活性，即使在室温下也能部分与丙烷反应，并与丙烯完全反应。相比之下，N2O不会形成这些高活性物种。相反，N2O的反应可能是通过亲核氧化物离子的参与进行的，这也是导致更高丙烯选择性的原因。

虽然文献中没有明确讨论N2O-ODHP特有的催化剂失活和稳定性挑战，但可以提出一些潜在的研究方向：

1. 催化剂设计：开发能够在使用N2O时保持高选择性同时提高活性的催化剂。

2. 反应机理研究：进一步研究N2O形成的反应途径和中间体，以优化催化剂性能。

3. 工艺工程：探索提高N2O利用效率的方法，并开发其再生或回收的方法。

4. 混合系统：研究将N2O与其他氧化剂或反应条件结合的潜力，以平衡活性和选择性。

5. 长期稳定性研究：进行延长试验以评估催化剂稳定性，并识别N2O-ODHP特有的失活机制。

6. 经济和环境分析：评估N2O-ODHP的整体可行性，考虑N2O生产成本和环境影响等因素。

通过解决这些领域的问题，研究人员可能克服N2O-ODHP的限制，使其成为更可行的实际应用选择。
