[1] "The remarkable ODHP performance of iron zeolites has been related to the specificity of N2O as a mono-oxygen donor and to the ability of determined iron species for coordinating reactive atomic oxygen species able to efficiently dehydrogenate propane"

[2] "The most promising zeolitic system reported so far is steam-activated Fe-ZSM-5, displaying initial propene yields up to 25%. These results are comparable with the highest values reported over V- and Mo-based catalysts with O2 as the oxidant"

[3] "A major drawback of iron zeolites in ODHP with N2O is the deactivation by coke, leading to a rapid decrease of the propylene yield"

[4] "Deactivation of iron zeolites in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane is caused by coke deposition on active extra-framework iron species."

[5] "Regeneration in air led to the disappearance of coke-related bands and the practically complete recovery of the original porosity, while the zeolite crystallinity remained intact."

[6] "The initial propylene yield over the fresh and regenerated FeGaSi zeolites was the same, but the latter sample exhibited faster deactivation. This is attributed to a change of iron constitution in the first reactionregeneration cycle."

[7] "TEM studies demonstrated an extensive degree of iron clustering as FeOx nanoparticles in the regenerated catalyst compared with the fresh and coked catalysts."

The use of nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) offers several advantages:

1. Specificity: N2O acts as a mono-oxygen donor, allowing for more controlled and selective oxidation reactions.

2. High propylene yields: Iron zeolites, particularly steam-activated Fe-ZSM-5, have shown initial propene yields up to 25%, comparable to the best results achieved with V- and Mo-based catalysts using O2 as the oxidant.

3. Efficient dehydrogenation: Certain iron species can coordinate reactive atomic oxygen species that effectively dehydrogenate propane.

However, there are critical challenges associated with catalyst deactivation and stability:

1. Coke deposition: The main cause of deactivation is coke formation on active extra-framework iron species, leading to a rapid decrease in propylene yield.

2. Regeneration issues: While regeneration in air can remove coke and restore porosity, it also leads to changes in iron constitution, resulting in faster deactivation in subsequent cycles.

3. Iron clustering: TEM studies have shown extensive iron clustering as FeOx nanoparticles in regenerated catalysts, which negatively impacts catalyst performance.

To address these limitations and make N2O-ODHP more feasible for practical implementation, the following strategies and research directions could be pursued:

1. Develop more coke-resistant catalysts: Research into catalyst compositions or structures that minimize coke formation while maintaining high activity and selectivity.

2. Optimize regeneration procedures: Investigate gentler regeneration methods that effectively remove coke without causing significant changes to the iron species' constitution.

3. Stabilize active iron sites: Explore ways to anchor or stabilize the active iron species to prevent clustering during regeneration cycles.

4. In-situ regeneration techniques: Develop methods for continuous or periodic regeneration that minimize the need for complete shutdown and high-temperature treatments.

5. Hierarchical zeolite structures: Design zeolites with improved mass transfer properties to reduce coke formation and enhance catalyst longevity.

6. Alternative iron-containing materials: Investigate other iron-containing porous materials that may offer improved stability and regeneration characteristics.

7. Process engineering solutions: Develop reactor designs or process configurations that minimize catalyst deactivation or allow for more efficient regeneration cycles.

By addressing these challenges through focused research and development efforts, the potential of N2O-ODHP could be more fully realized, potentially leading to its practical implementation in industrial processes.

使用一氧化二氮（N2O）作为氧化剂在丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）中有以下几个优势：

1. 特异性：N2O作为单氧供体，可以进行更加可控和选择性的氧化反应。

2. 高丙烯产率：铁沸石，特别是蒸汽活化的Fe-ZSM-5，已显示出高达25%的初始丙烯产率，可与使用O2作为氧化剂的V和Mo基催化剂的最佳结果相媲美。

3. 高效脱氢：某些铁物种可以配位活性原子氧物种，有效地脱氢丙烷。

然而，催化剂失活和稳定性方面存在一些关键挑战：

1. 积碳沉积：主要的失活原因是活性骨架外铁物种上的积碳形成，导致丙烯产率快速下降。

2. 再生问题：虽然在空气中再生可以去除积碳并恢复孔隙度，但也会导致铁组成发生变化，导致后续循环中失活速度加快。

3. 铁聚集：TEM研究表明，再生催化剂中存在大量铁聚集形成FeOx纳米颗粒，这对催化剂性能产生负面影响。

为了解决这些限制并使N2O-ODHP更适合实际应用，可以采取以下策略和研究方向：

1. 开发更耐积碳的催化剂：研究能够最大限度减少积碳形成同时保持高活性和选择性的催化剂组成或结构。

2. 优化再生程序：研究能有效去除积碳而不对铁物种组成造成显著变化的更温和再生方法。

3. 稳定活性铁位点：探索锚定或稳定活性铁物种的方法，以防止在再生循环中聚集。

4. 原位再生技术：开发连续或周期性再生的方法，以最大程度地减少完全停机和高温处理的需求。

5. 分级沸石结构：设计具有改进的传质性能的沸石，以减少积碳形成并提高催化剂寿命。

6. 替代铁含有材料：研究可能提供更好稳定性和再生特性的其他含铁多孔材料。

7. 过程工程解决方案：开发能够最小化催化剂失活或允许更有效再生循环的反应器设计或工艺配置。

通过针对性的研究和开发努力解决这些挑战，N2O-ODHP的潜力可能得到更充分的实现，有望在工业过程中得到实际应用。
