N2O is an effective oxidant for ODHP due to its specificity as a mono-oxygen donor, which allows for efficient dehydrogenation of propane when used with iron zeolite catalysts. The most promising catalytic system is steam-activated Fe-ZSM-5, which can achieve initial propene yields up to 25%, comparable to the best results obtained with V- and Mo-based catalysts using O2 as an oxidant.

The main advantages of using N2O in ODHP include high propylene selectivity and yield. However, the critical challenge associated with this process is rapid catalyst deactivation due to coke deposition on active extra-framework iron species. This leads to a quick decrease in propylene yield over time.

Various iron-containing zeolite catalysts have been employed in N2O-ODHP, including Fe-ZSM-5, FeAl-MFI, FeGa-MFI, and FeGe-MFI. These catalysts differ in their preparation methods, iron speciation, and acidic properties, which affect their performance and resistance to deactivation.

A major issue with catalyst stability is that regeneration is not fully reversible. While initial propylene yields can be restored after regeneration, the catalyst exhibits faster deactivation in subsequent cycles. This is due to alterations in iron speciation during the reaction-regeneration cycle, particularly iron clustering during coke burn-off.

To address these limitations and make N2O-ODHP more feasible for practical implementation, research should focus on:

1. Developing improved catalyst regeneration strategies that prevent modification of iron speciation during coke removal.
2. Designing catalysts with enhanced resistance to coke formation while maintaining high activity and selectivity.
3. Investigating methods to stabilize active iron species and prevent clustering during multiple reaction-regeneration cycles.
4. Exploring novel zeolite frameworks or hierarchical structures that could improve mass transfer and reduce coke formation.
5. Optimizing reaction conditions and reactor designs to minimize coke formation and extend catalyst lifetime.

By addressing these challenges, researchers may be able to develop more stable and efficient catalysts for N2O-ODHP, potentially making it a viable option for industrial propylene production.

N2O作为单氧供体的特性使其成为ODHP的有效氧化剂，当与铁沸石催化剂一起使用时，可以高效地脱氢丙烷。最有前景的催化体系是蒸汽活化的Fe-ZSM-5，其初始丙烯产率可达25%，与使用O2作为氧化剂的V和Mo基催化剂的最佳结果相当。

在ODHP中使用N2O的主要优势包括高丙烯选择性和产率。然而，这个过程的关键挑战是由于活性骨架外铁物种上的积碳沉积导致的催化剂快速失活。这导致丙烯产率随时间迅速下降。

N2O-ODHP中使用了各种含铁沸石催化剂，包括Fe-ZSM-5、FeAl-MFI、FeGa-MFI和FeGe-MFI。这些催化剂在制备方法、铁物种形态和酸性质上有所不同，这影响了它们的性能和抗失活能力。

催化剂稳定性的一个主要问题是再生不完全可逆。虽然再生后可以恢复初始丙烯产率，但催化剂在随后的循环中表现出更快的失活。这是由于反应-再生循环过程中铁物种形态的改变，特别是在焦炭燃烧过程中铁的团聚。

为了解决这些限制并使N2O-ODHP更适合实际应用，研究应该集中在：

1. 开发改进的催化剂再生策略，防止在焦炭去除过程中改变铁物种形态。
2. 设计具有增强抗积碳形成能力的催化剂，同时保持高活性和选择性。
3. 研究稳定活性铁物种的方法，防止在多次反应-再生循环中发生团聚。
4. 探索新型沸石骨架或分级结构，以改善传质并减少积碳形成。
5. 优化反应条件和反应器设计，以最小化积碳形成并延长催化剂寿命。

通过解决这些挑战，研究人员可能能够开发出更稳定和高效的N2O-ODHP催化剂，有望使其成为工业丙烯生产的可行选择。
