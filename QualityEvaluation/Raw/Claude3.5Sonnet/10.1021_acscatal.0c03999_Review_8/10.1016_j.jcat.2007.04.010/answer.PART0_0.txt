Nitrous oxide (N2O) shows promise as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) due to its specificity as a mono-oxygen donor. This property allows for efficient dehydrogenation of propane when used with iron zeolite catalysts. The most effective catalyst system reported is steam-activated Fe-ZSM-5, which can achieve initial propene yields of up to 25%. This performance is comparable to the best results obtained with other oxidants like O2 over V- and Mo-based catalysts.

However, the use of N2O in ODHP faces significant challenges, primarily related to catalyst deactivation and stability. The main issue is rapid deactivation by coke formation, which leads to a decrease in propylene yield over time. This problem is particularly pronounced in iron zeolite catalysts.

Another critical challenge is the irreversibility of catalyst regeneration. The study reveals that the regeneration process of iron-containing zeolites used in N2O-mediated selective oxidations is not fully reversible. While initial propylene yields may be restored after regeneration, the catalysts often exhibit faster deactivation in subsequent cycles. This is attributed to changes in iron speciation during the reaction-regeneration cycle, particularly the clustering of iron species during coke burn-off.

To address these limitations and make N2O-ODHP more feasible for practical implementation, several research directions can be proposed:

1. Develop improved catalyst designs that are more resistant to coke formation, possibly by modifying the acidity or pore structure of the zeolites.

2. Investigate alternative regeneration strategies that preserve the original iron speciation and prevent clustering. This could involve using different regeneration conditions or introducing stabilizing agents.

3. Explore novel catalyst compositions or supports that maintain high activity and selectivity while offering better stability and regeneration properties.

4. Study the mechanism of iron clustering during regeneration to develop targeted approaches for preventing this phenomenon.

5. Investigate continuous regeneration techniques or reactor designs that could minimize the impact of deactivation and extend catalyst lifetime.

6. Explore the use of promoters or additives that could enhance catalyst stability or facilitate easier regeneration without compromising activity.

By addressing these challenges, particularly the issues of rapid deactivation and irreversible changes during regeneration, N2O-ODHP could potentially become a more viable option for industrial propylene production.

一氧化二氮（N2O）作为丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）的氧化剂显示出很大潜力，这主要归功于其作为单氧供体的特性。这一特性使其在与铁沸石催化剂一起使用时能够高效地脱氢丙烷。目前报道的最有效的催化剂系统是蒸汽活化的Fe-ZSM-5，其初始丙烯产率可达25%。这一性能与使用其他氧化剂（如V和Mo基催化剂上的O2）获得的最佳结果相当。

然而，在ODHP中使用N2O面临着重大挑战，主要与催化剂失活和稳定性有关。最主要的问题是由于焦炭形成导致的快速失活，这会导致丙烯产率随时间降低。这个问题在铁沸石催化剂中尤为明显。

另一个关键挑战是催化剂再生的不可逆性。研究表明，用于N2O介导的选择性氧化的含铁沸石的再生过程并不完全可逆。虽然再生后的初始丙烯产率可能会恢复，但催化剂在随后的循环中往往会表现出更快的失活。这被归因于反应-再生循环过程中铁物种的变化，特别是在焦炭燃烧过程中铁物种的聚集。

为了解决这些限制并使N2O-ODHP更适合实际应用，可以提出几个研究方向：

1. 开发改进的催化剂设计，使其更能抵抗焦炭形成，可能通过修改沸石的酸度或孔结构来实现。

2. 研究能够保持原始铁物种分布并防止聚集的替代再生策略。这可能涉及使用不同的再生条件或引入稳定剂。

3. 探索新型催化剂组成或载体，在保持高活性和选择性的同时，提供更好的稳定性和再生性能。

4. 研究再生过程中铁聚集的机理，以开发有针对性的防止这种现象的方法。

5. 研究连续再生技术或反应器设计，以最大限度地减少失活的影响并延长催化剂寿命。

6. 探索使用促进剂或添加剂，以增强催化剂稳定性或促进更容易的再生，同时不影响活性。

通过解决这些挑战，特别是快速失活和再生过程中不可逆变化的问题，N2O-ODHP可能成为更可行的工业丙烯生产选择。
