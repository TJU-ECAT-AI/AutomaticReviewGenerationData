N2O is advantageous as an oxidant in ODHP due to its specificity as a mono-oxygen donor, allowing for efficient propane dehydrogenation when combined with appropriate iron species in zeolite catalysts. Iron-containing zeolites, particularly steam-activated Fe-ZSM-5, have shown promising results with propylene yields up to 25%, comparable to the best V- and Mo-based catalysts using O2 as an oxidant.

However, the major challenge in N2O-ODHP is catalyst deactivation due to coke deposition on active extra-framework iron species. This leads to a rapid decrease in propylene yield over time. Additionally, the regeneration process is not fully reversible, as it can cause changes in iron speciation and clustering, resulting in reduced catalyst efficiency after regeneration cycles.

To address these limitations and make N2O-ODHP more feasible for practical implementation, research should focus on:

1. Developing catalysts with improved resistance to coke formation.
2. Designing regeneration strategies that preserve the original iron speciation and distribution.
3. Investigating methods to stabilize active iron species and prevent clustering during regeneration.
4. Exploring novel zeolite frameworks or modifications that can enhance catalyst stability and longevity.
5. Optimizing reaction conditions to minimize coke formation while maintaining high propylene yields.
6. Developing in-situ regeneration techniques that can prolong catalyst lifetime without significant performance loss.

By addressing these challenges, researchers may be able to improve the long-term stability and efficiency of N2O-ODHP catalysts, potentially making this process more viable for industrial applications.

N2O作为ODHP的氧化剂具有优势，因为它是一种单氧供体，当与沸石催化剂中适当的铁物种结合时，可以有效地脱氢丙烷。含铁沸石，特别是蒸汽活化的Fe-ZSM-5，显示出令人鼓舞的结果，丙烯产率高达25%，可与使用O2作为氧化剂的最佳V和Mo基催化剂相媲美。

然而，N2O-ODHP的主要挑战是由于焦炭沉积在活性骨架外铁物种上导致的催化剂失活。这导致丙烯产率随时间迅速下降。此外，再生过程并非完全可逆，因为它可能导致铁物种发生变化和聚集，从而降低再生循环后的催化剂效率。

为了解决这些限制并使N2O-ODHP更适合实际应用，研究应集中在：

1. 开发具有更好抗焦炭形成能力的催化剂。
2. 设计能够保持原始铁物种和分布的再生策略。
3. 研究稳定活性铁物种并防止再生过程中聚集的方法。
4. 探索可以提高催化剂稳定性和寿命的新型沸石骨架或改性方法。
5. 优化反应条件，以最小化焦炭形成，同时保持高丙烯产率。
6. 开发原位再生技术，可以延长催化剂寿命而不会显著降低性能。

通过解决这些挑战，研究人员可能能够改善N2O-ODHP催化剂的长期稳定性和效率，使这一过程更适合工业应用。
