Nitrous oxide (N2O) has shown promise as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) due to its specificity as a mono-oxygen donor. This characteristic allows for efficient dehydrogenation of propane when used with iron-containing zeolite catalysts. The most successful catalyst system reported is steam-activated Fe-ZSM-5, which can achieve initial propylene yields of up to 25%.

However, the use of N2O in ODHP faces significant challenges, primarily related to catalyst deactivation and stability. The main issue is coking, which leads to a rapid decrease in propylene yield over time. This deactivation process severely limits the long-term effectiveness of the catalysts.

Furthermore, the regeneration of these iron-containing zeolites is not fully reversible. While coke deposits can be removed through air treatment, this process can alter the iron speciation in the catalyst. Specifically, air treatment for coke burn-off has been shown to cause significant iron clustering, resulting in a reduced number of active sites and consequently a less efficient catalyst for ODHP.

To address these limitations and make N2O-ODHP more feasible for practical implementation, several research directions can be pursued:

1. Develop improved catalyst formulations that are more resistant to coking or can maintain activity even in the presence of coke deposits.

2. Investigate alternative regeneration methods that can remove coke without altering the iron speciation in the catalyst.

3. Explore novel zeolite frameworks or supports that can better stabilize the active iron species and prevent clustering during regeneration.

4. Study the mechanisms of iron clustering during regeneration to develop strategies to mitigate this process.

5. Investigate continuous regeneration processes that might minimize the impact of regeneration on catalyst structure.

6. Explore the use of promoters or additives that can enhance the stability of iron species during reaction and regeneration cycles.

7. Develop advanced characterization techniques to better understand the changes in iron speciation during reaction and regeneration, which could inform more effective catalyst designs.

By addressing these challenges, particularly the issues of catalyst deactivation and irreversible changes during regeneration, N2O-ODHP could potentially become a more viable option for industrial propylene production.

一氧化二氮（N2O）作为氧化剂在丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）中显示出很大的潜力，这主要归功于其作为单氧供体的特异性。这一特性使得在使用含铁沸石催化剂时能够高效地脱氢丙烷。目前报道的最成功的催化剂体系是蒸汽活化的Fe-ZSM-5，其初始丙烯产率可达25%。

然而，在ODHP中使用N2O面临着重大挑战，主要涉及催化剂的失活和稳定性。最主要的问题是结焦，它会导致丙烯产率随时间迅速下降。这种失活过程严重限制了催化剂的长期有效性。

此外，这些含铁沸石的再生过程不是完全可逆的。虽然可以通过空气处理去除焦炭沉积物，但这个过程可能会改变催化剂中铁的形态。具体来说，为了燃烧焦炭而进行的空气处理已被证实会导致显著的铁聚集，从而减少活性位点数量，最终导致ODHP催化效率降低。

为了解决这些限制并使N2O-ODHP更适合实际应用，可以追求以下几个研究方向：

1. 开发更耐结焦或即使在存在焦炭沉积的情况下仍能保持活性的改进型催化剂配方。

2. 研究可以去除焦炭而不改变催化剂中铁形态的替代再生方法。

3. 探索能够更好地稳定活性铁物种并防止再生过程中聚集的新型沸石框架或载体。

4. 研究再生过程中铁聚集的机理，以制定减缓这一过程的策略。

5. 研究可能最小化再生对催化剂结构影响的连续再生过程。

6. 探索使用助剂或添加剂，以增强铁物种在反应和再生循环中的稳定性。

7. 开发先进的表征技术，以更好地理解反应和再生过程中铁形态的变化，这可以为更有效的催化剂设计提供信息。

通过解决这些挑战，特别是催化剂失活和再生过程中不可逆变化的问题，N2O-ODHP可能会成为工业丙烯生产的更可行选择。
