[1] "By replacement of O2 with N2O, overall activity decreased, while the selectivity towards propene formation increased for the same degree of propane conversion."

[2] "Replacing oxygen by nitrous oxide results in a decrease in the initial rates of products formation at all temperatures studied."

[3] "The rate of COx formation decreases strongly than the rate of propene formation when O2 is replaced by N2O. This effect is more pronounced for the catalytic materials with a high amount of vanadium oxide (4.69.5% wt.%)."

[4] "Gas-phase oxygen oxidises the reduced materials more fully and quickly than nitrous oxide."

[5] "From the redox mechanism of ODP (Eqs. (1) and (2)), the steady-state concentration of active oxygen species should be lower in the presence of N2O, since the decomposition of nitrous oxide is slower as compared to O2 activation."

[6] "Therefore, active oxygen species are expected to be more isolated on the catalyst surface at the same total concentration of vanadia, when N2O is used as an oxidant. In turn, the non-selective secondary oxidation of propene to COx is inhibited."

[7] "Thus, we assume that reducing the steady-state concentration of active lattice oxygen species enhances the selectivity of propene in the ODP, when O2 is replaced by N2O."

The use of nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) offers several advantages in terms of propylene selectivity compared to other oxidants, particularly oxygen (O2):

1. Increased propene selectivity: When N2O is used instead of O2, the selectivity towards propene formation increases for the same degree of propane conversion.

2. Reduced COx formation: The rate of COx (CO and CO2) formation decreases more significantly than the rate of propene formation when N2O replaces O2. This effect is especially pronounced for catalytic materials with high vanadium oxide content (4.6-9.5 wt.%).

3. Slower oxidation of reduced materials: N2O oxidizes reduced catalyst materials more slowly and less completely than O2, which contributes to maintaining a more reduced state of the catalyst surface during the reaction.

4. Lower steady-state concentration of active oxygen species: The slower decomposition of N2O compared to O2 activation leads to a lower steady-state concentration of active oxygen species on the catalyst surface.

5. Improved site isolation: The use of N2O results in more isolated active oxygen species on the catalyst surface, which inhibits the non-selective secondary oxidation of propene to COx.

The catalysts employed in this process are primarily vanadium oxide supported on alumina (VOx/γ-Al2O3) with varying vanadium loadings. The study investigates catalysts with vanadium concentrations ranging from 0.5 to 9.5 wt.%.

Critical challenges associated with catalyst deactivation and stability in N2O-ODHP include:

1. Overall decreased activity: While N2O improves selectivity, it also leads to a decrease in the initial rates of product formation at all temperatures studied.

2. Slower catalyst reoxidation: The slower oxidation of reduced catalyst materials by N2O may lead to challenges in maintaining catalyst activity over extended periods.

3. Potential carbon deposition: The study mentions the formation of coke-like species on low-loaded catalysts, which could contribute to catalyst deactivation over time.

To address these limitations and make N2O-ODHP more feasible for practical implementation, the following strategies or research directions could be pursued:

1. Catalyst optimization: Develop catalysts that balance the improved selectivity offered by N2O with higher activity. This could involve exploring different support materials, promoters, or novel synthesis methods to enhance the dispersion and stability of active sites.

2. Hybrid oxidant systems: Investigate the use of mixed oxidant systems (e.g., N2O + O2) to combine the selectivity benefits of N2O with the higher activity of O2.

3. Reactor design: Explore novel reactor configurations that can maximize the benefits of N2O while mitigating its limitations, such as membrane reactors or cyclic operation modes.

4. Process intensification: Develop methods to enhance heat and mass transfer in the reaction system, potentially improving overall efficiency and stability.

5. In-situ regeneration: Design catalysts and processes that allow for periodic or continuous in-situ regeneration to address deactivation issues.

6. Mechanistic studies: Conduct further research to better understand the precise mechanisms of N2O activation and its interaction with the catalyst surface to guide rational catalyst design.

7. Economic and environmental assessment: Perform comprehensive studies on the economic viability and environmental impact of N2O-ODHP compared to conventional processes to identify key areas for improvement and potential applications.

在丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）中使用一氧化二氮（N2O）作为氧化剂与其他氧化剂相比在丙烯选择性方面具有几个优势，特别是与氧气（O2）相比：

1. 提高丙烯选择性：当使用N2O代替O2时，在相同的丙烷转化度下，丙烯形成的选择性增加。

2. 减少COx生成：当N2O替代O2时，COx（CO和CO2）的生成速率比丙烯的生成速率下降更显著。这种效果在含有高浓度钒氧化物（4.6-9.5 wt.%）的催化材料中尤为明显。

3. 还原材料氧化速度较慢：N2O比O2更缓慢、更不完全地氧化还原后的催化剂材料，这有助于在反应过程中保持催化剂表面的还原状态。

4. 活性氧物种的稳态浓度较低：与O2活化相比，N2O分解速度较慢，导致催化剂表面活性氧物种的稳态浓度较低。

5. 改善位点隔离：使用N2O会导致催化剂表面的活性氧物种更加分散，从而抑制丙烯向COx的非选择性二次氧化。

这个过程中使用的催化剂主要是负载在氧化铝上的钒氧化物（VOx/γ-Al2O3），钒负载量不同。该研究考察了钒浓度范围为0.5至9.5 wt.%的催化剂。

N2O-ODHP中与催化剂失活和稳定性相关的关键挑战包括：

1. 整体活性降低：虽然N2O提高了选择性，但它也导致在所有研究温度下产物形成的初始速率降低。

2. 催化剂再氧化速度较慢：N2O对还原后催化剂材料的氧化速度较慢，可能会导致长期维持催化剂活性的挑战。

3. 潜在的碳沉积：研究提到在低负载催化剂上形成类焦炭物质，这可能会随时间推移导致催化剂失活。

为了解决这些限制并使N2O-ODHP更适合实际应用，可以采取以下策略或研究方向：

1. 催化剂优化：开发能够平衡N2O提供的改进选择性和更高活性的催化剂。这可能涉及探索不同的载体材料、助剂或新型合成方法，以增强活性位点的分散性和稳定性。

2. 混合氧化剂系统：研究混合氧化剂系统（如N2O + O2）的使用，结合N2O的选择性优势和O2的高活性。

3. 反应器设计：探索新型反应器配置，以最大化N2O的优势，同时减轻其局限性，例如膜反应器或周期性操作模式。

4. 过程强化：开发提高反应系统热质传递的方法，可能提高整体效率和稳定性。

5. 原位再生：设计允许定期或连续原位再生的催化剂和过程，以解决失活问题。

6. 机理研究：进行进一步研究，以更好地理解N2O活化和其与催化剂表面相互作用的精确机理，从而指导理性催化剂设计。

7. 经济和环境评估：与传统工艺相比，对N2O-ODHP的经济可行性和环境影响进行全面研究，以确定改进的关键领域和潜在应用。
