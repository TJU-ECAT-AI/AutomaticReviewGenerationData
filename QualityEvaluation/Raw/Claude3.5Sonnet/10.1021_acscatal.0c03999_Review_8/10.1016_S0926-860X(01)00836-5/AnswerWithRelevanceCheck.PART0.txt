          [1] "By replacement of O2 with N2O, overall activity decreased, while the selectivity towards propene formation increased for the same degree of propane conversion."

[2] "Replacing oxygen by nitrous oxide results in a decrease in the initial rates of products formation at all temperatures studied."

[3] "The rate of COx formation decreases strongly than the rate of propene formation when O2 is replaced by N2O. This effect is more pronounced for the catalytic materials with a high amount of vanadium oxide (4.6–9.5% wt.%)."

[4] "Gas-phase oxygen oxidises the reduced materials more fully and quickly than nitrous oxide."

[5] "Therefore, the steady-state concentration of active lattice oxygen species should be lower in the presence of N2O, since the decomposition of nitrous oxide is slower as compared to O2 activation. Therefore, active oxygen species are expected to be more isolated on the catalyst surface at the same total concentration of vanadia, when N2O is used as an oxidant."

[6] "Thus, we assume that reducing the steady-state concentration of active lattice oxygen species enhances the selectivity of propene in the ODP, when O2 is replaced by N2O."

          The use of nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) offers several advantages in terms of propylene selectivity compared to other oxidants, particularly oxygen (O2):

1. Increased propylene selectivity: N2O leads to higher selectivity towards propene formation compared to O2 at the same degree of propane conversion.

2. Reduced COx formation: The rate of COx (CO and CO2) formation decreases more significantly than the rate of propene formation when N2O replaces O2. This effect is particularly pronounced for catalysts with higher vanadium oxide content (4.6-9.5 wt.%).

3. Slower oxidation rate: N2O oxidizes reduced catalyst materials more slowly and less completely than O2, leading to a more reduced state of the catalyst under reaction conditions.

4. Lower steady-state concentration of active oxygen species: Due to slower N2O decomposition compared to O2 activation, active oxygen species are more isolated on the catalyst surface when N2O is used as an oxidant. This leads to a lower steady-state concentration of active lattice oxygen species.

5. Enhanced propene selectivity: The reduction in the steady-state concentration of active lattice oxygen species is believed to enhance the selectivity of propene in the ODP when O2 is replaced by N2O.

The main catalysts employed in this process are vanadium oxide supported on alumina (VOx/γ-Al2O3) with varying vanadium loadings, typically ranging from 0.5 to 9.5 wt.%.

Critical challenges associated with catalyst deactivation and stability include:

1. Overall activity decrease: The use of N2O results in lower overall catalytic activity compared to O2, with decreased initial rates of product formation at all studied temperatures.

2. Slower reoxidation of the catalyst: N2O is less effective in reoxidizing the reduced catalyst, which may lead to a gradual loss of active sites over time.

3. Potential carbon deposition: Although not explicitly mentioned in the provided quotes, carbon deposition is a common issue in dehydrogenation processes and could lead to catalyst deactivation over time.

To address these limitations and make N2O-ODHP more feasible for practical implementation, the following strategies or research directions could be pursued:

1. Catalyst optimization: Develop catalysts that maintain high propylene selectivity while minimizing the activity decrease associated with N2O use. This could involve exploring different support materials, promoters, or novel synthesis methods to enhance N2O activation and catalyst stability.

2. Hybrid oxidant systems: Investigate the use of mixed oxidant streams (e.g., N2O + O2) to balance selectivity and activity.

3. Process engineering: Optimize reactor design and operating conditions to maximize the benefits of N2O while minimizing its drawbacks, such as exploring novel reactor configurations or cyclic operation modes.

4. In-situ regeneration strategies: Develop efficient methods for periodic or continuous catalyst regeneration to address the slower reoxidation of catalysts when using N2O.

5. Mechanistic studies: Conduct further research to better understand the precise mechanisms of N2O activation and its interaction with the catalyst surface to guide rational catalyst design.

6. Economic and environmental assessment: Perform comprehensive studies on the economic viability and environmental impact of N2O-ODHP compared to conventional processes to identify key areas for improvement and potential applications.

7. Alternative N2O sources: Explore the use of N2O from industrial waste streams as a more sustainable oxidant source for ODHP.

By addressing these challenges and pursuing these research directions, N2O-ODHP could potentially become a more attractive option for propylene production in the future.

          使用一氧化二氮（N2O）作为丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）的氧化剂，在丙烯选择性方面相比其他氧化剂（特别是氧气O2）具有以下几个优势：

1. 提高丙烯选择性：在相同的丙烷转化度下，N2O导致比O2更高的丙烯形成选择性。

2. 减少COx生成：当N2O替代O2时，COx（CO和CO2）的生成速率比丙烯的生成速率降低得更显著。这种效果在高钒氧化物含量（4.6-9.5 wt.%）的催化剂上尤为明显。

3. 较慢的氧化速率：N2O比O2更缓慢、更不完全地氧化还原态催化剂材料，导致在反应条件下催化剂处于更还原的状态。

4. 活性氧物种的稳态浓度较低：由于N2O分解比O2活化慢，当使用N2O作为氧化剂时，活性氧物种在催化剂表面更加分散。这导致活性晶格氧物种的稳态浓度较低。

5. 提高丙烯选择性：活性晶格氧物种稳态浓度的降低被认为可以提高O2被N2O替代时ODP中丙烯的选择性。

这个过程中主要使用的催化剂是负载在氧化铝上的钒氧化物（VOx/γ-Al2O3），钒含量不同，通常在0.5至9.5 wt.%范围内。

与催化剂失活和稳定性相关的关键挑战包括：

1. 整体活性下降：使用N2O导致比O2更低的整体催化活性，在所有研究温度下产物形成的初始速率都有所降低。

2. 催化剂再氧化较慢：N2O在再氧化还原态催化剂方面不如O2有效，这可能导致活性位随时间逐渐损失。

3. 潜在的碳沉积：虽然在提供的引文中没有明确提到，但碳沉积是脱氢过程中的常见问题，可能导致催化剂随时间推移而失活。

为解决这些限制并使N2O-ODHP更适合实际应用，可以采取以下策略或研究方向：

1. 催化剂优化：开发能保持高丙烯选择性同时最小化与N2O使用相关的活性下降的催化剂。这可能涉及探索不同的载体材料、助剂或新型合成方法，以增强N2O活化和催化剂稳定性。

2. 混合氧化剂系统：研究混合氧化剂流（如N2O + O2）的使用，以平衡选择性和活性。

3. 工艺工程：优化反应器设计和操作条件，以最大化N2O的优势，同时最小化其缺点，例如探索新型反应器配置或周期性操作模式。

4. 原位再生策略：开发高效的定期或连续催化剂再生方法，以解决使用N2O时催化剂再氧化较慢的问题。

5. 机理研究：进行进一步研究，以更好地理解N2O活化和其与催化剂表面相互作用的精确机理，从而指导理性催化剂设计。

6. 经济和环境评估：与传统工艺相比，对N2O-ODHP的经济可行性和环境影响进行全面研究，以确定改进的关键领域和潜在应用。

7. 替代N2O来源：探索使用来自工业废气流的N2O作为ODHP的更可持续氧化剂来源。

通过解决这些挑战并追求这些研究方向，N2O-ODHP有潜力在未来成为更具吸引力的丙烯生产选择。
