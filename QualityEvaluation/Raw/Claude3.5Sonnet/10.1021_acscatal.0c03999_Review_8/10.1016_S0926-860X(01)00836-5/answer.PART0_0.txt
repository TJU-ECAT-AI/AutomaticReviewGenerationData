[1] "By replacement of O2 with N2O, overall activity decreased, while the selectivity towards propene formation increased for the same degree of propane conversion."

[2] "Replacing oxygen by nitrous oxide results in a decrease in the initial rates of products formation at all temperatures studied."

[3] "The rate of COx formation decreases strongly than the rate of propene formation when O2 is replaced by N2O. This effect is more pronounced for the catalytic materials with a high amount of vanadium oxide (4.6–9.5% wt.%)."

[4] "Gas-phase oxygen oxidises the reduced materials more fully and quickly than nitrous oxide."

[5] "Therefore, the catalytic material is more reduced under reaction conditions in the presence of N2O. In our previous work [25], we found that the selectivity towards propene formation is affected by surface reduction: the higher the surface reduction, the higher is the selectivity."

[6] "Thus, we assume that reducing the steady-state concentration of active lattice oxygen species enhances the selectivity of propene in the ODP, when O2 is replaced by N2O."

The use of nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) offers several advantages in terms of propylene selectivity compared to other oxidants, particularly oxygen (O2):

1. Increased propylene selectivity: N2O as an oxidant leads to higher selectivity towards propene formation compared to O2 at the same degree of propane conversion.

2. Reduced COx formation: The rate of COx (CO and CO2) formation decreases more significantly than the rate of propene formation when N2O replaces O2. This effect is particularly pronounced for catalysts with higher vanadium oxide content (4.6-9.5 wt.%).

3. Surface reduction effects: The catalytic material remains more reduced under reaction conditions with N2O compared to O2. Higher surface reduction correlates with higher propene selectivity.

4. Lower steady-state concentration of active oxygen: N2O leads to a lower steady-state concentration of active lattice oxygen species, which enhances propene selectivity in ODHP.

The study primarily focused on VOx/γ-Al2O3 catalysts with varying vanadium loadings (0.5-9.5 wt.%). The catalysts' performance was affected by factors such as reducibility, structure of vanadia species, electronic properties, and the ability to reoxidize reduced active sites.

Critical challenges associated with catalyst deactivation and stability were not explicitly addressed in the given literature. However, some potential issues can be inferred:

1. Coke formation: The study mentioned coke-like species formation on low-loaded catalysts, which could lead to deactivation over time.

2. Thermal stability: High-temperature operations might affect the long-term stability of the catalysts, especially regarding the dispersion of vanadia species.

3. Slower reoxidation: N2O's slower reoxidation of the catalyst compared to O2 might impact long-term stability and activity.

To address these limitations and make N2O-ODHP more feasible for practical implementation, the following strategies or research directions could be pursued:

1. Optimize catalyst composition: Develop catalysts that balance high selectivity with sufficient activity, possibly by exploring different support materials or promoters.

2. Improve N2O activation: Investigate methods to enhance N2O decomposition and activation on the catalyst surface without compromising selectivity.

3. Enhance heat management: Develop reactor designs or catalytic systems that can better manage the heat generated during the reaction, improving stability and reducing hot spots.

4. Study long-term stability: Conduct extended studies on catalyst stability under N2O-ODHP conditions to identify and address specific deactivation mechanisms.

5. Explore bimetallic or multi-component catalysts: Investigate catalysts that combine the benefits of N2O selectivity with improved activity and stability.

6. Optimize reaction conditions: Fine-tune reaction parameters such as temperature, pressure, and feed composition to maximize the benefits of N2O while minimizing potential drawbacks.

7. Develop regeneration strategies: If deactivation occurs, research effective methods for catalyst regeneration that are compatible with N2O-ODHP processes.

使用一氧化二氮（N2O）作为氧化剂在丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）中相比其他氧化剂在丙烯选择性方面具有几个优势，特别是与氧气（O2）相比：

1. 提高丙烯选择性：在相同的丙烷转化程度下，使用N2O作为氧化剂会导致更高的丙烯形成选择性。

2. 减少COx形成：当N2O替代O2时，COx（CO和CO2）的形成速率比丙烯形成速率降低更显著。这种效果在高钒氧化物含量（4.6-9.5 wt.%）的催化剂上尤为明显。

3. 表面还原效应：与O2相比，在N2O反应条件下，催化材料保持更还原状态。更高的表面还原程度与更高的丙烯选择性相关。

4. 活性氧的稳态浓度更低：N2O导致活性晶格氧物种的稳态浓度更低，这提高了ODHP中的丙烯选择性。

该研究主要关注了具有不同钒负载量（0.5-9.5 wt.%）的VOx/γ-Al2O3催化剂。催化剂的性能受到还原性、钒物种结构、电子性质以及还原活性位点再氧化能力等因素的影响。

文献中没有明确提到与催化剂失活和稳定性相关的关键挑战。但是，可以推断出一些潜在问题：

1. 积碳形成：研究提到在低负载催化剂上形成类似焦炭的物种，这可能导致随时间推移而失活。

2. 热稳定性：高温操作可能影响催化剂的长期稳定性，特别是钒物种的分散度。

3. 较慢的再氧化：与O2相比，N2O对催化剂的再氧化较慢，可能影响长期稳定性和活性。

为了解决这些限制并使N2O-ODHP更适合实际应用，可以采取以下策略或研究方向：

1. 优化催化剂组成：开发平衡高选择性和足够活性的催化剂，可能通过探索不同的载体材料或促进剂。

2. 改善N2O活化：研究提高N2O在催化剂表面分解和活化的方法，同时不影响选择性。

3. 加强热管理：开发能更好管理反应过程中产生热量的反应器设计或催化系统，提高稳定性并减少热点。

4. 研究长期稳定性：在N2O-ODHP条件下进行延长的催化剂稳定性研究，以识别和解决特定的失活机制。

5. 探索双金属或多组分催化剂：研究结合N2O选择性优势与改进的活性和稳定性的催化剂。

6. 优化反应条件：微调温度、压力和进料组成等反应参数，以最大化N2O的优势，同时最小化潜在缺点。

7. 开发再生策略：如果发生失活，研究与N2O-ODHP过程兼容的有效催化剂再生方法。
