[1] "By replacement of O2 with N2O, overall activity decreased, while the selectivity towards propene formation increased for the same degree of propane conversion."

[2] "Since N2O decomposition, over the studied materials, is less favourable than O2 activation, a decrease in the steady-state concentration of active sites and an increase of the propene selectivity is achieved."

[3] "Catalyst oxidation with N2O is slower as compared to O2. This phenomenon was also supported by UVVIS measurements under C3H8/N2O/N2 and C3H8/O2/N2 conditions at 773 K."

[4] "Replacing oxygen by nitrous oxide results in a decrease in the initial rates of products formation at all temperatures studied. The rate of COx formation decreases strongly than the rate of propene formation when O2 is replaced by N2O."

[5] "Therefore, the steady-state concentration of active lattice oxygen species should be lower in the presence of N2O, since the decomposition of nitrous oxide is slower as compared to O2 activation. Therefore, active oxygen species are expected to be more isolated on the catalyst surface at the same total concentration of vanadia, when N2O is used as an oxidant."

The use of nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) offers several advantages in terms of propylene selectivity compared to other oxidants, particularly oxygen (O2):

1. Increased propene selectivity: N2O leads to higher propene selectivity at the same degree of propane conversion compared to O2.

2. Slower oxidation rate: N2O oxidizes the catalyst more slowly than O2, resulting in a lower steady-state concentration of active sites. This slower oxidation rate contributes to increased propene selectivity.

3. Reduced COx formation: The rate of COx (CO and CO2) formation decreases more significantly than the rate of propene formation when N2O replaces O2, further improving selectivity.

4. More isolated active oxygen species: Due to the slower decomposition of N2O compared to O2 activation, active oxygen species are expected to be more isolated on the catalyst surface when N2O is used as an oxidant.

The main catalysts employed in this process are vanadium oxide supported on alumina (VOx/γ-Al2O3) with varying vanadia loadings. The study investigated catalysts with 0.5, 1, 4.6, and 9.5 wt% vanadia content.

Critical challenges associated with catalyst deactivation and stability were not explicitly discussed in the provided literature. However, some potential issues can be inferred:

1. Lower overall activity: The use of N2O results in decreased overall activity compared to O2, which may impact the process efficiency.

2. Slower catalyst reoxidation: The slower oxidation rate of the catalyst by N2O might lead to longer cycle times and potentially affect long-term stability.

To address these limitations and make N2O-ODHP more feasible for practical implementation, the following strategies or research directions could be pursued:

1. Catalyst optimization: Develop catalysts that can maintain high activity while preserving the selectivity advantages of N2O. This could involve exploring different support materials or promoters to enhance N2O decomposition without sacrificing selectivity.

2. Process engineering: Investigate ways to compensate for the lower activity, such as optimizing reaction conditions (temperature, pressure, flow rates) or exploring novel reactor designs that can maximize the benefits of N2O while minimizing its drawbacks.

3. Hybrid oxidant systems: Explore the use of mixed oxidant systems (e.g., N2O + O2) to balance activity and selectivity.

4. In-situ regeneration techniques: Develop methods for efficient in-situ catalyst regeneration to address potential deactivation issues arising from the slower reoxidation rate.

5. Economic and environmental assessment: Conduct comprehensive studies on the economic viability and environmental impact of N2O-ODHP compared to conventional processes to identify areas for improvement and justify further research and development efforts.

一氧化二氮（N2O）作为丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）的氧化剂，在丙烯选择性方面相比其他氧化剂具有几个优势，特别是与氧气（O2）相比：

1. 提高丙烯选择性：在相同的丙烷转化程度下，N2O导致比O2更高的丙烯选择性。

2. 较慢的氧化速率：N2O比O2更慢地氧化催化剂，导致活性位点的稳态浓度降低。这种较慢的氧化速率有助于提高丙烯选择性。

3. 减少COx生成：当N2O替代O2时，COx（CO和CO2）的生成速率比丙烯的生成速率降低得更显著，进一步提高了选择性。

4. 更分散的活性氧物种：由于N2O的分解比O2的活化更慢，当使用N2O作为氧化剂时，活性氧物种预计在催化剂表面更加分散。

这个过程中主要使用的催化剂是负载在氧化铝上的氧化钒（VOx/γ-Al2O3），钒含量不同。研究考察了钒含量为0.5、1、4.6和9.5 wt%的催化剂。

所提供的文献中没有明确讨论与催化剂失活和稳定性相关的关键挑战。然而，可以推断出一些潜在问题：

1. 整体活性降低：使用N2O与O2相比会导致整体活性降低，这可能会影响过程效率。

2. 催化剂再氧化速度较慢：N2O对催化剂的较慢氧化速率可能导致周期时间延长，潜在影响长期稳定性。

为了解决这些限制并使N2O-ODHP在实际应用中更加可行，可以采取以下策略或研究方向：

1. 催化剂优化：开发能够保持高活性同时保留N2O选择性优势的催化剂。这可能涉及探索不同的载体材料或促进剂，以增强N2O分解而不牺牲选择性。

2. 过程工程：研究补偿低活性的方法，如优化反应条件（温度、压力、流速）或探索能够最大化N2O优势同时最小化其缺点的新型反应器设计。

3. 混合氧化剂系统：探索混合氧化剂系统（如N2O + O2）的使用，以平衡活性和选择性。

4. 原位再生技术：开发高效的原位催化剂再生方法，以解决由于较慢的再氧化速率可能引起的失活问题。

5. 经济和环境评估：对比N2O-ODHP与传统工艺进行全面的经济可行性和环境影响研究，以确定改进领域并为进一步的研究和开发努力提供依据。
