[1] "By replacement of O2 with N2O, overall activity decreased, while the selectivity towards propene formation increased for the same degree of propane conversion."

[2] "Replacing oxygen by nitrous oxide results in a decrease in the initial rates of products formation at all temperatures studied. The rate of COx formation decreases strongly than the rate of propene formation when O2 is replaced by N2O."

[3] "Gas-phase oxygen oxidises the reduced materials more fully and quickly than nitrous oxide. Besides, UVVIS measurements under reaction conditions (C3H8/N2O/N2 or C3H8/O2/N2) demonstrate that additional V5+ cations are in a reduced state when oxygen is replaced by N2O."

[4] "Therefore, the steady-state concentration of active lattice oxygen species should be lower in the presence of N2O, since the decomposition of nitrous oxide is slower as compared to O2 activation. Therefore, active oxygen species are expected to be more isolated on the catalyst surface at the same total concentration of vanadia, when N2O is used as an oxidant."

[5] "To achieve a high performance in ODP, it appears desirable to design catalytic surfaces which are fully covered by well-dispersed vanadia species for avoiding the strong adsorption of propene on the support surface."

Nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) offers several advantages in terms of propylene selectivity compared to other oxidants, particularly oxygen (O2):

1. Increased propene selectivity: The use of N2O instead of O2 leads to higher selectivity towards propene formation at the same degree of propane conversion.

2. Reduced COx formation: The rate of COx (CO and CO2) formation decreases more significantly than the rate of propene formation when N2O replaces O2, further improving selectivity.

3. Lower oxidation rate: N2O oxidizes reduced catalyst materials more slowly and less completely than O2, resulting in a higher concentration of reduced V5+ cations on the catalyst surface.

4. Isolated active oxygen species: The slower decomposition of N2O compared to O2 activation leads to a lower steady-state concentration of active lattice oxygen species. This results in more isolated active oxygen species on the catalyst surface, which favors selective oxidation over combustion reactions.

The main catalysts employed in this process are vanadia-based materials, particularly VOx/γ-Al2O3 catalysts with varying vanadia loadings. The study focuses on catalysts with vanadia concentrations ranging from 0.5 to 9.5 wt%.

Critical challenges associated with catalyst deactivation and stability include:

1. Carbon deposition: Low-loaded vanadia catalysts (< 1 wt%) are more prone to carbon deposition, which can lead to deactivation.

2. Support acidity: The acidic nature of γ-Al2O3 support can cause strong adsorption of propene, leading to non-selective oxidation.

3. Vanadia distribution: Ensuring optimal dispersion of vanadia species on the support surface is crucial for maintaining high selectivity and activity.

To address these limitations and make N2O-ODHP more feasible for practical implementation, the following strategies and research directions could be pursued:

1. Catalyst design: Develop catalysts with well-dispersed vanadia species that fully cover the support surface to minimize non-selective oxidation on the support.

2. Support modification: Explore less acidic or non-acidic supports to reduce propene adsorption and subsequent non-selective oxidation.

3. Optimization of vanadia loading: Find the optimal vanadia concentration that balances high activity with high selectivity.

4. Promoter addition: Investigate the use of promoters to enhance catalyst stability and resistance to carbon deposition.

5. Reactor design: Develop reactor configurations that can efficiently manage the heat generated during the reaction and maintain optimal reaction conditions.

6. Process integration: Explore the possibility of integrating N2O-ODHP with other processes that produce N2O as a by-product to improve overall process efficiency and economics.

7. In-situ regeneration: Develop methods for periodic in-situ catalyst regeneration to remove carbon deposits and restore catalyst activity.

By addressing these challenges and pursuing these research directions, the N2O-ODHP process could potentially become a more viable option for propylene production in the future.

在丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）过程中使用一氧化二氮（N2O）作为氧化剂与其他氧化剂相比，在丙烯选择性方面具有以下几个优势：

1. 提高丙烯选择性：在相同的丙烷转化度下，使用N2O替代O2可以提高丙烯的选择性。

2. 减少COx生成：当N2O替代O2时，COx（CO和CO2）的生成速率比丙烯的生成速率降低得更显著，进一步提高了选择性。

3. 较低的氧化速率：N2O比O2氧化还原态催化剂材料的速度更慢、程度更低，导致催化剂表面上还原态V5+阳离子的浓度更高。

4. 孤立的活性氧物种：与O2活化相比，N2O的分解速度较慢，导致活性晶格氧物种的稳态浓度较低。这使得催化剂表面上的活性氧物种更加孤立，有利于选择性氧化反应而非燃烧反应。

这个过程中主要使用的催化剂是基于钒的材料，特别是具有不同钒负载量的VOx/γ-Al2O3催化剂。研究主要关注钒浓度在0.5至9.5 wt%范围内的催化剂。

与催化剂失活和稳定性相关的关键挑战包括：

1. 碳沉积：低负载钒催化剂（< 1 wt%）更容易发生碳沉积，可能导致失活。

2. 载体酸性：γ-Al2O3载体的酸性可能导致丙烯的强吸附，从而引起非选择性氧化。

3. 钒分布：确保钒物种在载体表面的最佳分散对于保持高选择性和活性至关重要。

为了解决这些限制并使N2O-ODHP更适合实际应用，可以考虑以下策略和研究方向：

1. 催化剂设计：开发具有良好分散钒物种的催化剂，使其完全覆盖载体表面，以最大程度地减少载体上的非选择性氧化。

2. 载体改性：探索酸性较弱或非酸性载体，以减少丙烯吸附和随后的非选择性氧化。

3. 优化钒负载量：找到平衡高活性和高选择性的最佳钒浓度。

4. 添加助剂：研究使用助剂来提高催化剂的稳定性和抗碳沉积能力。

5. 反应器设计：开发能够有效管理反应过程中产生的热量并保持最佳反应条件的反应器配置。

6. 工艺集成：探索将N2O-ODHP与其他产生N2O副产品的工艺集成的可能性，以提高整体工艺效率和经济性。

7. 原位再生：开发周期性原位催化剂再生方法，以去除碳沉积物并恢复催化剂活性。

通过解决这些挑战并追求这些研究方向，N2O-ODHP工艺有望在未来成为一种更可行的丙烯生产选择。
