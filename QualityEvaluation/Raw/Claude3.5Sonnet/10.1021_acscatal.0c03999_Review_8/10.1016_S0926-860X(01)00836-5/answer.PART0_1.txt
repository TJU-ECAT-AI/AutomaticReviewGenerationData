[1] "By replacement of O2 with N2O, overall activity decreased, while the selectivity towards propene formation increased for the same degree of propane conversion."

[2] "Replacing oxygen by nitrous oxide results in a decrease in the initial rates of products formation at all temperatures studied."

[3] "The rate of COx formation decreases strongly than the rate of propene formation when O2 is replaced by N2O. This effect is more pronounced for the catalytic materials with a high amount of vanadium oxide (4.69.5% wt.%)."

[4] "Gas-phase oxygen oxidises the reduced materials more fully and quickly than nitrous oxide."

[5] "UVVIS measurements under reaction conditions (C3H8/N2O/N2 or C3H8/O2/N2) demonstrate that additional V5+ cations are in a reduced state when oxygen is replaced by N2O. Therefore, the catalytic material is more reduced under reaction conditions in the presence of N2O."

[6] "From the redox mechanism of ODP (Eqs. (1) and (2)), the steady-state concentration of active oxygen species should be lower in the presence of N2O, since the decomposition of nitrous oxide is slower as compared to O2 activation. Therefore, active oxygen species are expected to be more isolated on the catalyst surface at the same total concentration of vanadia, when N2O is used as an oxidant."

The use of nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) offers several advantages in terms of propylene selectivity compared to other oxidants, particularly oxygen (O2):

1. Increased selectivity: N2O leads to higher propene selectivity compared to O2 at the same degree of propane conversion.

2. Reduced COx formation: The rate of COx (CO and CO2) formation decreases more significantly than the rate of propene formation when N2O replaces O2, especially for catalysts with higher vanadium oxide content.

3. Slower oxidation: N2O oxidizes reduced catalyst materials more slowly and less completely than O2, leading to a more reduced state of the catalyst under reaction conditions.

4. Lower steady-state concentration of active oxygen species: Due to slower N2O decomposition compared to O2 activation, active oxygen species are more isolated on the catalyst surface when N2O is used as an oxidant.

The main catalysts employed in this process are vanadium oxide supported on alumina (VOx/γ-Al2O3) with varying vanadium loadings. The study focused on catalysts with vanadium concentrations ranging from 0.5 to 9.5 wt%.

Critical challenges associated with catalyst deactivation and stability include:

1. Overall activity decrease: The use of N2O results in lower overall catalytic activity compared to O2.

2. Slower reoxidation of the catalyst: N2O is less effective in reoxidizing the reduced catalyst, which may lead to a gradual loss of active sites over time.

3. Potential carbon deposition: The study mentions the formation of coke-like species on low-loaded catalysts, which could lead to deactivation over time.

To address these limitations and make N2O-ODHP more feasible for practical implementation, the following strategies or research directions could be pursued:

1. Catalyst optimization: Develop catalysts that maintain high propylene selectivity while minimizing the activity decrease associated with N2O use. This could involve exploring different support materials or promoters to enhance N2O activation.

2. Hybrid oxidant systems: Investigate the use of mixed oxidant streams (e.g., N2O + O2) to balance selectivity and activity.

3. Regeneration strategies: Develop efficient in-situ or ex-situ catalyst regeneration methods to address the slower reoxidation of catalysts when using N2O.

4. Process engineering: Optimize reactor design and operating conditions to maximize the benefits of N2O while minimizing its drawbacks.

5. Economic and environmental assessment: Conduct comprehensive studies on the economic viability and environmental impact of N2O-ODHP compared to conventional processes to justify its industrial implementation.

6. Alternative N2O sources: Explore the use of N2O from industrial waste streams as a more sustainable oxidant source for ODHP.

By addressing these challenges and pursuing these research directions, N2O-ODHP could potentially become a more attractive option for propylene production in the future.

一氧化二氮（N2O）作为丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）的氧化剂，在丙烯选择性方面相比其他氧化剂具有以下优势：

1. 提高选择性：在相同的丙烷转化度下，N2O导致比O2更高的丙烯选择性。

2. 减少COx生成：当N2O替代O2时，COx（CO和CO2）的生成速率比丙烯生成速率降低得更显著，尤其是对于高钒氧化物含量的催化剂。

3. 较慢的氧化：N2O比O2更缓慢、更不完全地氧化还原态催化剂材料，导致在反应条件下催化剂处于更还原的状态。

4. 活性氧物种的稳态浓度较低：由于N2O分解比O2活化慢，当使用N2O作为氧化剂时，活性氧物种在催化剂表面更加分散。

这个过程中主要使用的催化剂是负载在氧化铝上的钒氧化物（VOx/γ-Al2O3），钒含量不同。研究重点关注了钒浓度在0.5至9.5 wt%范围内的催化剂。

与催化剂失活和稳定性相关的关键挑战包括：

1. 整体活性下降：使用N2O导致比O2更低的整体催化活性。

2. 催化剂再氧化较慢：N2O在再氧化还原态催化剂方面不如O2有效，这可能导致活性位随时间逐渐损失。

3. 潜在的碳沉积：研究提到在低负载催化剂上形成类似焦炭的物种，这可能导致随时间推移而失活。

为解决这些限制并使N2O-ODHP更适合实际应用，可以采取以下策略或研究方向：

1. 催化剂优化：开发能保持高丙烯选择性同时最小化与N2O使用相关的活性下降的催化剂。这可能涉及探索不同的载体材料或助剂以增强N2O活化。

2. 混合氧化剂系统：研究混合氧化剂流（如N2O + O2）的使用，以平衡选择性和活性。

3. 再生策略：开发高效的原位或非原位催化剂再生方法，以解决使用N2O时催化剂再氧化较慢的问题。

4. 工艺工程：优化反应器设计和操作条件，以最大化N2O的优势，同时最小化其缺点。

5. 经济和环境评估：对比N2O-ODHP与传统工艺的经济可行性和环境影响，进行全面研究，以证明其工业实施的合理性。

6. 替代N2O来源：探索使用来自工业废气流的N2O作为ODHP的更可持续氧化剂来源。

通过解决这些挑战并追求这些研究方向，N2O-ODHP有潜力在未来成为更具吸引力的丙烯生产选择。
