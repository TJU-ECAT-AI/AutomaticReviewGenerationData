1. Introduction
The enormous reserves and the low cost of natural gas raised an
increasing interest towards the processing of its hydrocarbon
components, namely methane and lower amounts of ethane,
propane, butanes [1,2]. Because of such composition natural gas is
one of the cleanest of all primary fossil fuels for both the
production of energy and the production of other valuable
molecules, like olefins. In particular, the transformation of light
alkanes into light alkenes by catalytic dehydrogenation is of high
interest because the existing production from steam cracking is not
sufficient to meet the increasing needs of the market. Unfortu-
nately, direct dehydrogenation (DD) of alkanes is a highly
endothermic reaction (e.g. for propane DH298 K = +124.2 kJ/mol)
and to reach high conversions the shift of the equilibrium, by
decreasing the pressure or increasing the temperature, is required.
Additionally, higher reaction temperatures favour the thermal
cracking of hydrocarbons, resulting into the production of lighter
alkanes and coke.
A way to overcome thermodynamic restrictions is the removal
of hydrogen from the reaction system by adding a suitable oxidant.
Hence, oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of light alkanes by using
O2 has become the object of many investigations as an alternative
process. Usually the exothermic ODH process (e.g. for propane
DH298 K = 117 kJ/mol) proceeds at lower temperatures as com-
pared with direct dehydrogenation, and the presence of O2 results
in significant decrease of cracking and formation of coke. Never-
theless, the industrial application of this process has been till now
prevented by the low selectivity due to the over-oxidation of
alkanes and alkenes to carbon oxides, and explosion hazards of
hydrocarbon/oxygen mixtures. As a possible improvement, the
addition of CO2 to the feed has been considered, also on the basis of
the successful examples of other partial oxidation reactions, such
as dry reforming [3,4] and oxidative coupling of methane [5,6].
However, ODH of light alkanes in the presence of CO2 is an
endothermic process (e.g. for propane DH298 K = +166.6 kJ/mol),
thus the addition of a small amount of oxygen decreases the energy
demand. Furthermore, coke formation is decreased also, resulting
in an increased catalyst stability.
Most studies in the field of ODH of light paraffins in the
presence of CO2 or CO2/O2 mixtures were devoted to ethane [7
21], while ODH of C3C4-alkanes was explored in a lower extent
[17,2229]. Independently of the alkane, it has been proposed that
the better performances obtained with CO2/O2 mixtures should be

Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane and isobutane has been investigated over CrOx/silica catalysts
prepared by wet impregnation (Cr loading: from 0.5 to 7.5 wt%) using carbon dioxide as oxidant. In
particular, reaction conditions were set to attain high conversions, similar to that required in industrial
processes. The highest activity, selectivity and stability were exhibited by a catalyst with a Cr loading of
5.0 wt%. DR UVvis studies indicated that Cr(VI) ions in the form of mono-, di- and polychromates were
present in all catalysts, while Cr(III) oxide (a-Cr2O3) was found only for Cr loading higher than 3.0 wt%.
The catalyst activity seemed correlated to more dispersed chromates. Introduction of oxygen in the
reaction mixture up to 5.0 vol.% resulted in a significant increase of catalysts activity and stability. Some
decrease in the propene and isobutene selectivity occurred, but because of the increase of the selectivity
towards lighter olefins, the total olefin selectivity increased.

due to the competitive adsorption between O2 and CO2 on sites for
a potential total oxidation, where CO2 is dissociated, instead of O2,
producing adsorbed CO and O atoms, these latter exhibiting a high
dehydrogenation activity [8,2931]. Furthermore, Nakagawa et al.
[22] suggested that such surface O atoms can promote a faster re-
oxidation of surface chromium species and eliminate deposited
carbon (in addition to the reaction between CO2 and C with the
formation of CO).
Alkaline-earth, transition and rare-earth metal oxides have
been tested as catalysts for ODH of C2C4 in the presence of CO2,
but the best performance has been obtained with chromium
supported on various oxides, zeolites, active carbon and diamond.
Among the supported systems the most promising results were
obtained for SiO2 [12,15,17,21,23,24], also in a mesoporous form
[17,27,28], and diamond [22] loaded with 1.78.0 wt% Cr.
Several basic insights on the ODH of light alkanes with CO2 and
CO2/O2 mixtures have been obtained by using such catalysts, but,
because of specific targets, in those studies the settings of the
operational conditions resulted quite far from those of actual
interest for industrial processes (i.e. conversion  50% and total
olefin selectivity  90%). As an aspect of novelty, herein we report a
study of the catalytic performance of a series of CrOx/SiO2 catalysts,
tested in the ODH of propane and isobutane at high conversions.
The tests has been carried out by using as oxidant both CO2 only
and CO2/O2 mixture. The features of supported chromium species
have been assessed by DR UVvis spectroscopy to get insights into
their structurefunction relationships.
2. Experimental
2.1. Catalyst preparation
Catalysts were prepared by wet impregnation of a commercial
silica (KSKG, Russia) with solution of Cr(NO3)39H2O of appropriate
concentration to obtain the desired Cr loading. Before impregna-
tion, the silica, initially in the form of spheres, was ground and
sieved, and the fraction with particle size in the 0.250.50 mm
range was selected. This fraction was calcined in air flow at 600 8C
for at least 2 h. Chromium solutions were mixed with silica (5 ml/
cm3 of SiO2), stirred for 2 h at room temperature (r.t.), dried at
100 8C and finally calcined at 600 8C in air flow for at least 2 h. The
catalysts, their codes and texture features are listed in Table 1.
2.2. Characterization methods
The specific surface area (SSA) of catalysts was measured with a
Micromeritics ASAP 2010 by nitrogen adsorption at 77 K following
the BET method, while pore volume and size were obtained by
using the BJH model. Before the measurements all samples were
degassed at 150 8C.
Diffuse Reflectance UVvis spectroscopy (DR UVvis) measure-
ments were performed with a PerkinElmer Lambda19 instrument
equipped with an integrating sphere with the internal surface
covered with BaSO4. The samples were additionally ground in an
agate mortar and the obtained fine powders were placed in a flow
reactor connected to a side branch with sealed a cell with optical
quartz windows. The samples were treated in the reactor at 600 8C
under flow of O2 for 2 h, cooled to r.t. and kept in static O2. For the
collection of DR UVvis spectra the powders were then transferred
in the side branch. The obtained reflectance spectra were
converted in the KubelkaMunk (KM) function. Preliminary
measurements

loa-
ding  3.0 wt% the intensity exceeded the limit of validity of the
function (KM >1) over several part of the spectral range. After
some trial, KM values 1 over all the spectral range were
obtained by diluting the samples with bare silica (ground in a
similar way) in a 1:7 ratio by weight. The same dilution than was
used for all catalysts.
2.3. Catalytic tests
Catalytic studies were carried out in a flow reactor in the 500
700 8C temperature range and at atmospheric pressure. The
composition of the reaction feed was CnH2n+2:CO2:N2 = 1:2:3.7
or CnH2n+2:CO2:O2:N2 = 1:2:0.3:3.4. Initial partial pressures for the
ODH of propane were P0
C3H8  0:15 atm and P0
CO2  0:30 atm, while
for ODH of isobutane P0
i-C4H10  0:10 atm and P0
CO2  0:20 atm.
Volume space velocity (w, h1) was varied in the 703000 h1
range. Before the tests, all catalysts were activated in air flow at
T = 600 8C for at least 1 h. The reaction products were analysed by
GC methods (instrumental error: 4%) using two columns
molecular sieve 5A (H2, O2, N2, CH4, CO, H2O) and Porapak Q (CO2,
hydrocarbons). The first analysis was carried out after 20 min of the
reaction at the desired temperature, providing data assumed as initial
conversion and selectivity. After each experiment the catalysts were
regenerated in air flow at T = 600 8C for 2 h. The conversion of CO2 was
evaluated for the runs carried out in the absence of O2 only, because
when O2 was in the feed some CO2 was produced also.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Preliminary thermodynamic evaluations
Oxidative dehydrogenation of paraffins in the presence of CO2 is
an endothermic equilibrium process. To verify the feasibility of the
process, calculations of the equilibrium constants (Kp) and DG at
the temperatures of interest have been performed. Different
reaction pathways and several values of equilibrium yields have
been reported in the literature for the ODH of light alkanes [32
36]. In the present case the thermodynamic estimation of the
process has been modelled on the reaction:
