Active carbon was used as a support for chromium(III) oxide phase. The synthesized materials appeared
to be very active catalysts of the propane dehydrogenation in the presence of CO2. An influence of the
Cr content on the catalytic activity and selectivity was observed. The best results were achieved over the
sample containing about 5 wt.% of Cr. A negative effect of activity decay with time-on-stream was found.
The reasons of the observed deactivation were explained using the thermal analysis method. A behavior
of the fresh and used samples was tested in a temperature range of 251000 C in different atmospheres
(inert gas, air or CO2). It was found that the catalytic runs resulted in a partial decomposition of surface
O-containing groups, which together with CrOx species play a role of active centers. Moreover, a formation
of inactive carbonaceous deposit on the catalyst surface was observed.

1. Introduction
Active carbons are relatively cheap materials, which can be syn-
thesized by chemical or physical activation starting from, e.g. wood,
coal, lignite, coconut shell, peat, fruit pits, polymers or petroleum
processing residues. An extremely expanded surface area, a unique
surface composition as well as stability both in acidic and basic
media are features of active carbons finding interest in the catal-
ysis field. It is not therefore surprising that these materials are
widely studied as supports of catalytically active phase. Many
active carbon supported catalysts have been already commercial-
ized (e.g. active carbon supported noble metals for hydrogenation
processes) [1]. Active carbon appeared to be a very promising can-
didate for a support of alkane dehydrogenation catalysts as well.
Their catalytic performance was tested in the dehydrogenation
of ethylbenzene and isobutane in the presence of carbon diox-
ide [25]. However, conversion of propane to propene via the
direct dehydrogenation route is even more important research
subject.
Propene is a very important raw material used as a feedstock
for variety of chemical intermediates and polymers. Nowadays, it

is obtained predominantly as a primary ethene co-product from
steam cracking of natural gas or naphtha and from fluid cat-
alytic cracking of liquid petroleum products. Additionally, small
propene sources are on-purpose technologies, such as: dehy-
drogenation of propane, olefin metathesis and natural gas base
processmethanol to olefins (MTO).
Growing demand on propene, driven mainly by increasing
demand on polypropylene, acrylonitrile, propylene oxide and
cumene, stimulates studies aimed at finding new methods of
propene production from alternative sources and an improve-
ment of propene yield from conventional sources. Recently, the
dehydrogenation of propane with CO2 has been studied [68] as
an alternative technology for non-oxidative dehydrogenation of
propane. In the new process, propene is obtained with higher yield
than in the traditional one. This promoting effect of CO2 is explained
by its participation in:
(1) direct
oxidation
of
propane
to
propene
(C3H8 + CO2 = C3H6 + CO + H2O) [9,10];
(2) hydrogen consumption by reverse watergas shift reaction
(CO2 + H2 = CO + H2O), which shifts propane dehydrogenation
equilibrium [1114];
(3) coke gasification (CO2 + Ccoke = 2CO), which slows down the
deactivation rate of catalyst [11,13].

A great variety of catalysts have been tested in the dehydro-
genation of propane in the presence of CO2 [924]. Different
oxides (Ga, Cr, V, Fe, Zr and Zn) were used as the active compo-
nents, while potassium oxide was used as a promoter. Inorganic
oxides (SiO2, Al2O3, TiO2, ZrO2, MgO), mesoporous sieves (MCM-
41, SBA-15, MSU-x) and carbonaceous materials (diamond, active
carbon) were tested as the supports. Some of these studies have
demonstrated that promoting effect of CO2 on the dehydro-
genation of propane strongly depends on properties of support
[9,10,13,15,21].
In the presented work, we have shown the promoting effect of
active carbon support in the catalytic process of propane dehydro-
genation in the presence of carbon dioxide. The real role of this
support in the studied reaction has been discussed basing on the
results of TG analysis of fresh and used chromium oxide supported
on active carbon in inert and oxidizing (the presence of air or CO2)
atmospheres.
2. Experimental
2.1. Materials
Carbon (Cheviron-Carbon GmbH) with a low ash content of
0.31 wt.% was initially activated with 90% HNO3 at 90 C for 1 h.
After washing and drying (180 C, 2 h), the resulting active car-
bon (AC) was impregnated by the incipient wetness technique
with an aqueous solution of chromium(III) nitrate. An amount of
Cr(NO3)3·9H2O used was calculated to obtain the supported cat-
alysts containing 2.5, 5.0, 7.5 and 10.0 wt.% Cr, respectively. The
impregnated samples were dried at 180 C for 3 h in air, and subse-
quently calcined at 650 C for 3 h in argon atmosphere.
2.2. Characterization methods
The calcined materials were characterized with respect to
structure by powder X-ray diffraction (XRD). XRD patterns were
recorded in 2 range of 1075using a Siemens D5005 instru-
ment operated at 40 kV and 60 mA with a Cu K X-ray source
at room temperature. Moreover, texture of the obtained sam-
ples was determined using adsorption of nitrogen at 196 C. The
adsorptiondesorption isotherms were collected in an ASAP 2010
instrument (Micromeritics). Prior to the analysis, the active carbons
were outgassed at 350 C for 12 h. The collected data were analyzed
by the BET, t-plot and Horwath-Kawazoe models.
TG analysis was performed on a Mettler Toledo TGA/SDTA
851 instrument equipped with a mass spectrometer Thermo Star
(Balzers) in a constant flow of argon, air or CO2 (80 ml/min). Approx-
imately, 25 mg of each sample was heated in a platinum pan from
30 to 1000 C with a heating rate of 10 C/min.
2.3. Catalytic study
The dehydrogenation of propane in the presence or absence of
CO2 was carried out in a flow-type reactor packed with 200 mg of
catalyst (grain size 0.20.3). The feed was a mixture of C3H8:CO2
or C3H8:He (16.7 vol.% of C3H8 and 83.3 vol.% of CO2 or He) at the
molar ratio of 1:5. The total flow rate of the feed was 30 ml/min.
Prior to the catalytic runs, the catalysts were preheated in dry He
stream at 600 C for 1 h and then the reaction was carried out
at a required temperature in the range between 500 and 650 C.
The reaction products and unreacted substrates were analyzed
using two gas chromatographs. One of them, equipped with a glass
column (3 m × 3 mm) packed with Porapak Q and a flame ion-
ization detector, was used for the analysis of hydrocarbons. The
second chromatograph was equipped with a stainless steel column
(3 m × 3mm) packed with Carboxen 1000 and a thermal conductiv-
ity detector (for H2, CO and CO2 analyses). Propane conversion (Cp),
products yield (Yi) and selectivity (Si) were calculated according to
the following equations:
Yi(%) =
(ai/3)ni
nC3H8 + nC3H6 + 2/3nC2H6 + 2/3nC2H4 + 1/3nCH4

nC3H6 + 2/3nC2H6 + 2/3nC2H4 + 1/3nCH4

where ai is a number of carbon atoms in a compound i, ni the num-
ber of moles of compound i, Yp the yield of propene and Sp is the
selectivity to propene.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Catalyst characterization
The calcined AC based samples modified with chromium were
studied by XRD. The recorded patterns are shown in Fig. 1. It should
be noticed that the catalysts containing a relatively small amount of
Cr exhibit rather amorphous nature. An increase in the Cr loading
results in an appearance of crystalline phase of chromium oxide.

Fig. 2. Isotherm adsorptiondesorption of N2 at 196 C and pore size distribution
determined by the Horwath-Kawazoe model for the AC sample.
The presence of this phase, which is manifested by three diffrac-
tion lines at about 33.5, 36.1and 54.82, is most distinct for the
Cr(10.0)/AC sample. The observed diffraction peaks can be indexed
as (1 0 4), (1 1 0) and (1 1 6), respectively, and are characteristic for
rhombohedral -Cr2O3 with space group R
3c.
The textural properties of the calcined materials were deter-
mined by the adsorption of N2 at 196 C. An example of
adsorptiondesorption isotherm recorded for the non-modified
active carbon is presented in Fig. 2. The shape of the collected
isotherms, which can be determined as type I according to the
IUPAC classification, demonstrates that the studied samples are
typical microporous solids. The calculation of pore size distribution
based on the Horwath-Kawazoe model confirms this conclusion.
The pore size distribution curves (Fig. 2, inset) indicate that a
majority of pores existing in the AC-based samples possesses an
extremely small size <7 
A.
The nature and size of pores were not essentially changed after
the modification with chromium oxide. For the samples contain-
ing Cr (not shown), submicropores still play a dominant role. On
the other hand, the specific surface area determined formally using
the BET or Langmuir equation decreases with raising the Cr load-
ing (Table 1). A similar effect was found for the micropore volume
calculated according to the t-plot method. It should therefore be
assumed that chromium oxide species are deposited mainly on an
external surface of the active carbon support. The formed clusters
and crystallites of Cr2O3 partially block an access to the microp-
ores. However, even for the sample with the highest chromium
content (Cr(10.0)/AC), the BET surface area is as high as 875 m2/g
and micropore volume exceeds 0.250 cm3/g.

The obtained samples were tested as catalysts of the dehydro-
genation of propane to propene in the presence of carbon dioxide.

The optimal catalyst composition was determined for the reac-
tion performed at a thermodynamically reasonable temperature
of 600 C. An influence of the Cr loading on the initial propane con-
version and the products selectivity is demonstrated in Fig. 3A and
B, respectively. The non-modified active carbon support exhibits
a quite reasonable activity in the process, which can be carried
out with propane conversion of 16.5% in this case. Active carbons
are typical acid-type solids with acidity attributed to the surface
oxygen-containing species like carbonyl and carboxyl groups. It is
most likely that the process of propane dehydrogenation is cat-
alyzed by such active sites present on the AC surface.
The propane conversion increases with the Cr content and
reaches maximum of 51.3% for the Cr(5.0)/AC catalyst. Further
enrichment of a sample in chromium results in a slight decay of its
catalytic activity. This effect should be attributed to the formation
of -Cr2O3 phase (detected by XRD), which has been found to be
poorly active in the alkane dehydrogenation [25]. Therefore, it could
be concluded that a high dispersion of chromium is a key parameter
influencing the catalytic activity of the active carbon-based sam-
ples. The propane conversion achieved over the studied catalysts
is correlated with selectivity towards propene, which is the main
reaction product. It is found that when the propane conversion
increases, a decrease in the propene selectivity is observed. Never-
theless, a high selectivity towards propene (>80.0%) was obtained
for all the studied catalysts. Three side products (methane, ethane
and ethylene) of C3 hydrocarbons cracking were formed with selec-
tivity below 10%.
It should be stressed that the activity observed for the Cr(5.0)/AC
catalyst is indeed very high compared to other catalysts previously
studied in the propane dehydrogenation with CO2 [10,14]. An effect
of temperature on the rate of homogeneous phase reaction (empty
reactor) and the catalytic performance of the Cr(5.0)/AC sample is
comparatively presented in Fig. 4A and B, respectively. The propane
conversion and selectivity towards propene were measured for the
reactions performed in the absence and presence of CO2. It is found
that the conversion of propane in the gas phase begins at temper-
ature about 550 C. This process is so slow that even at 650 C only
8.5% (in inert atmosphere) or 9.0% (in CO2-containing atmosphere)
of propane is converted. The homogeneous phase reaction results
in a formation of mainly cracking products. An introduction of solid
catalyst leads to a significant increase in both activity and selectivity
of the process. It is observed that regardless to the feed composi-
tion, an increase in the reaction temperature causes an increase in
the propane conversion and a drop in selectivity towards propene
over the Cr(5.0)/AC catalyst. This effect is the most distinct when the
maximal reaction temperature of 650 C is reached. Nevertheless,
the promoting effect of carbon dioxide on the catalytic performance
is clearly observed. CO2 can be involved in the propane transforma-
tion via two independent reaction paths. Carbon dioxide can play
a role of an oxidizing agent:
C3H8
+
CO2
=
C3H6
+
H2O
+
CO.
It is also possible that a two-steps reaction occurs. First step is
propane dehydrogenation to propene:
C3H8
=
C3H6
+
H2.
The formed hydrogen is subsequently converted by CO2 to water
and carbon monoxide according to the reverse watergas shift reac-
tion (RWGS):
H2
+
CO2
=
H2O
+
CO.
The molar fractions of the products formed during the reaction
over the Cr(5.0)/AC catalyst in the presence and absence of CO2 are
presented in Fig. 5, respectively. It can be found that in both cases

hydrogen appears among the reaction products. Therefore, it can be
concluded that the studied catalyst is active in the direct dehydro-
genation of propane to propene. It should be assumed that in the
presence of CO2 a part of H2 is eliminated by the RWGS reaction,
what is manifested by an increase in the amount of CO produced.
However, a participation of the oxidative propane dehydrogena-
tion as a competitive reaction in the propene formation cannot be
excluded as well.
Unfortunately,
the

undergo a fast deactivation with time-on-stream. The rate of activ-
ity loss expressed in term of relative yield of cracking (methane,
ethylene and ethane) or dehydrogenation (propene) products for
the Cr(5.0)/AC sample is presented in Fig. 6. It is observed that
the deactivation is faster in the CO2-rich atmosphere compared
to inert one. This effect could be attributed to the higher yield of
propene formed in the reaction performed in the presence of carbon
dioxide. The produced propene can be a precursor of inactive coke
deposited on the catalyst surface. On the other hand, CO2 is too mild
oxidizing agent to remove effectively the carbonaceous deposit. It
should, moreover, be noticed that both in the presence and absence
of CO2, the yield of the reaction products decreases with time-on-
stream. However, the catalysts lose their activity in the formation of
cracking products faster than in the dehydrogenation of propane to
propene. The cracking process is commonly catalyzed by acidic sur-
face sites. Therefore, it could be suspected that during the reaction
acid sites are preferentially poisoned or decomposed.
3.3. Thermal analysis
A first attempt of explanation of deactivation mechanism led
us to the application of the thermogravimetric method. We have
tested a behavior of four samples (AC, fresh Cr(5.0)/AC and used

Cr(5.0)/AC after the reaction performed in He or CO2) at ele-
vated temperatures in inert atmosphere. The obtained results are
shown in Fig. 7. The decomposition of the AC sample undergoes
in two stages. At lower temperatures (<150 C), the removal of
chemisorbed water from the surface is observed. An increase of
temperature to about 550 C results in the decomposition of sur-
face groups, which are partially stable up to 1000 C. The DTG curve
recorded for the Cr(5.0)/AC is similar to that measured for AC. It
should, however, be noted that an additional mass loss at about
920 C is observed for Cr(5.0)/AC. This effect can be assigned to
reduction of Cr(III) to metallic chromium by carbonaceous support.
The thermal analysis performed for the Cr(5.0)/AC sample used in
the catalytic runs in the CO2 and He atmosphere shows a significant
decrease in the detected total mass loss. It is clear that an amount of
oxygen-containing surface species was drastically reduced during
the catalytic reaction. The decrease in a number of surface sites is
more pronounced after the catalytic run in inert atmosphere. Tak-
ing into account the catalytic role of carbonyl/carboxyl groups in
the conversion of propane it should therefore be concluded that
the presence of carbon dioxide in the feed partially protects the
active carbon-based catalysts against deactivation.
Apart from the decomposition of active centers, a formation of
carbonaceous deposit encapsulating the active phase of chromium
oxide can be a reason of the catalyst deactivation. The samples pre-
sented above (AC, fresh Cr(5.0)/AC and used Cr(5.0)/AC after the
reaction performed in He or CO2) were tested by the thermal anal-
ysis in the air atmosphere as well. The DTG curves collected in the
presence of oxygen (Fig. 8) exhibit a significantly higher total mass
loss compared to that observed in the inert atmosphere. Oxidation
of the non-modified active carbon begins at temperature of about
460 C and reaches a maximum of rate at 650 C. The sample lost
99.68% of its initial mass up to 680 C, when oxidation was com-
pleted. An introduction of chromium on the active carbon surface
caused a clear shift of oxidation process towards lower tempera-
tures. Evidently, CrOx present in the samples is a catalytically active
phase in carbon gasification. The fresh Cr(5.0)/AC catalyst starts
to be burned at temperature as low as 300 C. There is not fur-
ther mass loss above 460 C in the case of this sample. It should
be stressed that the presence of the introduced chromium oxide
results in lower total mass loss (86.89%) than for the AC material.
Similar DTG profiles were recorded for the Cr(5.0)/AC sample used
in the catalytic runs. It should, however, be noticed that the decom-
position of carbonyl/carboxyl groups in the course of the propane
dehydrogenation stabilized slightly the carbonaceous support. The
Cr(5.0)/AC catalyst used in the reaction is gasified starting from
310 C. Moreover, a difference in stability between the samples used
in the inert and CO2 atmosphere can be distinguished. The gasifica-
tion of the catalyst used in the process performed in the presence
of CO2 is more intensive compared to the same sample exposed to
the mixture of helium and propane. The Cr(5.0)/AC catalyst used

sphere (measurement conditions: sample 0.025 g; CO2 flow rate = 80 ml/min;

32

strowski et al. / Thermochimica Acta 471 (2008) 2632
in the reaction with He lost 88.14% of its initial mass, whereas this
catalyst used in the CO2-containing feed88.51%. An increase in
the total mass loss observed for the used catalysts in comparison
to the fresh sample suggests that the carbonaceous deposit was
formed during the dehydrogenation process. Therefore, it should be
concluded that the drop in the catalytic activity observed with time-
on-stream can be attributed to both removal of carbonyl/carboxylic
groups and the formation of inactive coke on the catalyst
surface.
Finally, the interaction between CO2 and the active carbon-
based samples was studied by TG. The resulting DTG profiles are
shown in Fig. 9. It should be noticed that CO2 is much less effective
oxidizing agent compared to air. The non-modified active carbon
reacts with carbon dioxide above 850 C. The maximum observed
between 640 and 830 C in the DTG curve recorded for this sam-
ple should be attributed to the decomposition of surface groups,
which was also detected for the measurement performed in the
inert atmosphere. The catalytic effect of CrOx phase on gasifica-
tion of the AC support with CO2 was found. It begins at about
650 C for the fresh Cr(5.0)/AC sample. The used catalysts are more
resistant for gasification by CO2. Depending on the reaction con-
ditions, the Cr(5.0)/AC sample begins to be oxidized at 670 (CO2
atmosphere) or 690 C (He atmosphere). The TG measurements per-
formed in the CO2 atmosphere evidence that temperature used in
the catalytic experiments was too low for the reaction between
carbon dioxide present in the reactant feed and the active carbon
support.
4. Conclusions
The CrOx-containing active carbons appeared to be extremely
active catalysts for the propane dehydrogenation in the presence
of carbon dioxide. It was found that the catalytic activity and selec-
tivity strongly depended on the Cr loading. The highest propane
conversions were achieved for the sample with the Cr content
closed to 5 wt.%. An increase in the Cr loading resulted in the forma-
tion of crystalline -Cr2O3 phase, a partial blocking of micropores
and a decrease in the catalytic activity. Unfortunately, the active
carbon-based catalyst underwent a fast deactivation.
The thermal analysis method was applied to study the reasons
of the activity loss. TG experiments performed in the flow of inert
gas showed that the active carbon support exhibited the presence
of carbonyl- and carboxyl-like surface species which played a role
in the catalytic process. A gradual decrease in the surface concen-
tration of these groups was observed after the catalytic run. On
the other hand, inactive coke was formed in the course of the
propane dehydrogenation on the catalyst surface. This effect was
confirmed by TG measurements in the O2-rich atmosphere. Addi-
tionally, it was proved that CO2 was practically inert in a relation
to the carbonaceous support in the conditions used during the cat-
alytic process.
