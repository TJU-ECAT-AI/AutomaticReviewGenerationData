[1] "As recently reported by three independent research groups [25], a promising alternative system for ODHP arises from the application of iron zeolites using N2O as the oxidant, leading to remarkable propylene yields at a substantially lower operation temperature (643773 K) in comparison with the mixed metal oxides (823923 K)."

[2] "In general, the yield of C3H6 and the conversion of C3H8 over the zeolites decrease with time due to coke formation [4], which leads to a gradual catalyst deactivation. Coke makes the active sites inaccessible by poisoning of iron species or causing pore blockage."

[3] "The eventual universality of the correlation here and in [14], where a strong increase of the turnover frequency for phenol and propylene production with decreasing Fe loading, can be associated with a model where isolated iron species play an essential role in the performance."

[4] "For both ODHP and BTOP, the occurrence of iron association in the form of large clusters should be minimized to obtain a selective catalyst due to the total oxidation of important intermediates leading to the desired product over iron oxide."

The use of nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) offers several advantages over other oxidants, particularly in terms of propylene selectivity. The literature indicates that N2O-ODHP using iron zeolites leads to remarkable propylene yields at significantly lower operating temperatures compared to traditional mixed metal oxide catalysts with other oxidants.

Various catalysts have been employed in N2O-ODHP, with iron zeolites showing the most promise. These include Fe-ZSM-5, Fe-silicalite, and Fe-beta zeolites prepared through different methods such as hydrothermal synthesis, liquid-ion exchange, and chemical vapor deposition. The preparation method and iron content significantly influence the catalyst's performance.

The critical challenges associated with N2O-ODHP primarily involve catalyst deactivation and stability. Coke formation is a major issue, causing gradual deactivation by poisoning active iron species or blocking pores. This leads to a decrease in propylene yield and propane conversion over time.

To address these limitations and make N2O-ODHP more feasible for practical implementation, several strategies and research directions can be proposed:

1. Optimizing iron content: Research shows that isolated iron species play an essential role in catalyst performance. Reducing iron loading while maintaining high dispersion could improve selectivity and stability.

2. Catalyst preparation methods: Further investigation into preparation techniques that promote the formation of isolated iron sites while minimizing large iron clusters could enhance catalyst selectivity and stability.

3. Acidity control: Studying the role of acidity in the reaction and optimizing the balance between acidic sites and iron species could potentially improve catalyst performance and reduce coking.

4. Novel zeolite structures: Exploring different zeolite frameworks or hierarchical structures might lead to improved mass transfer and reduced coke formation.

5. Regeneration strategies: Developing efficient methods for in-situ or periodic catalyst regeneration could extend catalyst lifetime and maintain high activity.

6. Kinetic and mechanistic studies: A deeper understanding of the reaction mechanism and deactivation processes could guide the design of more stable and selective catalysts.

7. Process engineering: Investigating reactor designs or operating conditions that minimize coking or enable continuous catalyst regeneration could improve the overall process efficiency.

By addressing these challenges and pursuing these research directions, N2O-ODHP could potentially become a more viable option for industrial propylene production.

在丙烷氧化脱氢(ODHP)中使用一氧化二氮(N2O)作为氧化剂相比其他氧化剂有几个优势，特别是在丙烯选择性方面。文献表明，使用铁沸石的N2O-ODHP在显著较低的操作温度下可以获得卓越的丙烯产率，相比传统的使用其他氧化剂的混合金属氧化物催化剂。

N2O-ODHP中使用了各种催化剂，其中铁沸石显示出最大的潜力。这些包括通过不同方法制备的Fe-ZSM-5、Fe-硅石和Fe-β沸石，如水热合成、液相离子交换和化学气相沉积。制备方法和铁含量显著影响催化剂的性能。

N2O-ODHP面临的关键挑战主要涉及催化剂失活和稳定性。结焦是一个主要问题，通过毒化活性铁物种或阻塞孔道导致催化剂逐渐失活。这导致丙烯产率和丙烷转化率随时间降低。

为了解决这些限制并使N2O-ODHP更适合实际应用，可以提出几种策略和研究方向：

1. 优化铁含量：研究表明，孤立的铁物种在催化剂性能中起着关键作用。降低铁负载量同时保持高分散度可以提高选择性和稳定性。

2. 催化剂制备方法：进一步研究促进孤立铁位形成同时最小化大型铁簇的制备技术，可以提高催化剂的选择性和稳定性。

3. 酸度控制：研究酸度在反应中的作用，优化酸性位点和铁物种之间的平衡，可能改善催化剂性能并减少结焦。

4. 新型沸石结构：探索不同的沸石框架或层次结构可能导致改善的传质和减少结焦。

5. 再生策略：开发高效的原位或周期性催化剂再生方法可以延长催化剂寿命并保持高活性。

6. 动力学和机理研究：对反应机理和失活过程的深入理解可以指导设计更稳定和选择性的催化剂。

7. 过程工程：研究能够最小化结焦或实现连续催化剂再生的反应器设计或操作条件可以提高整体过程效率。

通过解决这些挑战并追求这些研究方向，N2O-ODHP可能成为工业丙烯生产的更可行选择。
