[1] "As recently reported by three independent research groups [25], a promising alternative system for ODHP arises from the application of iron zeolites using N2O as the oxidant, leading to remarkable propylene yields at a substantially lower operation temperature (643773 K) in comparison with the mixed metal oxides (823923 K)."

[2] "In general, the yield of C3H6 and the conversion of C3H8 over the zeolites decrease with time due to coke formation [4], which leads to a gradual catalyst deactivation. Coke makes the active sites inaccessible by poisoning of iron species or causing pore blockage."

[3] "The N2O conversion over cvd-Fe-Z and lie-Fe-Z after 400 min on stream remains at relatively high values (100% and 65%, respectively), in comparison with st-Fe-Z (25%). In the latter, both N2O and C3H8 conversions follow the same trend."

[4] "Our results indicate the extraordinary quality of iron traces in the commercial zeolite sample for the ODHP reaction particularly after steam treatment. The isolated nature of the iron species in this sample can be envisaged in view of the high dilution of iron in the zeolite matrix."

The use of nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) offers several advantages over traditional oxidants. N2O allows for higher propylene selectivity and enables the reaction to occur at lower temperatures compared to mixed metal oxide catalysts using oxygen. Iron zeolites have emerged as promising catalysts for this process, with various preparation methods yielding different performances.

However, catalyst deactivation remains a critical challenge in N2O-ODHP. The main cause of deactivation is coke formation, which blocks active sites and pores over time, reducing catalyst effectiveness. Different catalysts show varying degrees of deactivation, with some maintaining high N2O conversion but low propylene selectivity after extended use.

To address these limitations and improve the feasibility of N2O-ODHP, several strategies could be pursued:

1. Catalyst optimization: Focus on developing catalysts with isolated iron species, as these show higher activity and selectivity. Steam treatment of commercial zeolites with iron impurities has shown promise in this regard.

2. Deactivation mitigation: Investigate methods to reduce coke formation or periodically regenerate catalysts to maintain activity.

3. Process engineering: Explore reactor designs or operational parameters that could minimize catalyst deactivation or allow for continuous regeneration.

4. Mechanistic studies: Conduct further research to understand the reaction mechanism and the role of different iron species to guide catalyst design.

5. Balancing activity and selectivity: Develop catalysts that maintain high propylene selectivity while achieving sufficient conversion rates.

6. Economic analysis: Evaluate the overall process economics, considering the lower reaction temperatures and potential savings in energy costs versus the expense of N2O as an oxidant.

By addressing these challenges, N2O-ODHP could potentially become a more viable option for industrial propylene production.

在丙烷氧化脱氢(ODHP)中使用一氧化二氮(N2O)作为氧化剂相比传统氧化剂有几个优势。N2O能够提供更高的丙烯选择性，并且与使用氧气的混合金属氧化物催化剂相比，反应可以在更低的温度下进行。铁沸石已经成为这一过程中很有前景的催化剂，不同的制备方法会产生不同的性能。

然而，催化剂失活仍然是N2O-ODHP面临的一个关键挑战。失活的主要原因是焦炭形成，它会随时间推移阻塞活性位点和孔隙，降低催化剂的有效性。不同的催化剂表现出不同程度的失活，有些在长期使用后仍保持高N2O转化率，但丙烯选择性低。

为了解决这些限制并提高N2O-ODHP的可行性，可以采取以下几种策略：

1. 催化剂优化：专注于开发具有孤立铁物种的催化剂，因为这些催化剂表现出更高的活性和选择性。对含有铁杂质的商业沸石进行蒸汽处理在这方面显示出了希望。

2. 减少失活：研究减少焦炭形成的方法，或定期再生催化剂以保持活性。

3. 工艺工程：探索能够最小化催化剂失活或允许连续再生的反应器设计或操作参数。

4. 机理研究：进行进一步研究以了解反应机理和不同铁物种的作用，从而指导催化剂设计。

5. 平衡活性和选择性：开发能够保持高丙烯选择性同时达到足够转化率的催化剂。

6. 经济分析：评估整个过程的经济性，考虑较低的反应温度和潜在的能源成本节省与N2O作为氧化剂的费用之间的平衡。

通过解决这些挑战，N2O-ODHP可能成为工业丙烯生产更可行的选择。
