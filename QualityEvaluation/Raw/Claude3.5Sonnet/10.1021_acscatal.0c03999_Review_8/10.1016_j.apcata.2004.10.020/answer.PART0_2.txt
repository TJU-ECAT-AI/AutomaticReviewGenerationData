[1] "As recently reported by three independent research groups [25], a promising alternative system for ODHP arises from the application of iron zeolites using N2O as the oxidant, leading to remarkable propylene yields at a substantially lower operation temperature (643773 K) in comparison with the mixed metal oxides (823923 K)."

[2] "Propylene yields in the range of 2225% were attained over steam-activated Fe-ZSM-5, much higher over the iron zeolites prepared by post-synthesis methods (916%), with propylene selectivities around 40%."

[3] "In general, the yield of C3H6 and the conversion of C3H8 over the zeolites decrease with time due to coke formation [4], which leads to a gradual catalyst deactivation. Coke makes the active sites inaccessible by poisoning of iron species or causing pore blockage."

[4] "The st-Fe-Z zeolite exhibits a remarkable resistance towards deactivation, showing an increase in propylene yield from 22% to 25% during the first 20 min on stream, which is maintained during 75 min."

[5] "Our results suggest that traces of well-isolated (mononuclear) Fe species released from framework positions by steaming are extremely active in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propylene, while large iron clusters enhance deep oxidation of important reaction intermediates to COx."

The use of nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) offers several advantages:

1. Higher propylene yields: N2O-ODHP using iron zeolites achieves remarkable propylene yields (22-25%) compared to other oxidants.

2. Lower operation temperature: The process operates at 643-773 K, which is substantially lower than the 823-923 K required for mixed metal oxide catalysts using other oxidants.

3. Improved selectivity: Some catalysts, particularly steam-activated H-ZSM-5, show high propylene selectivity (up to 90%) when using N2O.

Various catalysts have been employed in N2O-ODHP, including:

1. Steam-activated Fe-ZSM-5
2. Liquid-ion exchanged Fe-ZSM-5
3. Chemical vapor deposited Fe-ZSM-5
4. Commercial H-ZSM-5 (with iron impurities)

The critical challenges associated with catalyst deactivation and stability include:

1. Coke formation: This leads to gradual catalyst deactivation by poisoning active sites or causing pore blockage.
2. Varying deactivation rates: Different catalysts show different resistance to deactivation, with steam-activated Fe-ZSM-5 showing better stability.
3. Iron clustering: Large iron clusters enhance deep oxidation of reaction intermediates to COx, reducing selectivity.

To address these limitations and make N2O-ODHP more feasible, potential strategies include:

1. Optimizing steam activation: Further research on steam treatment to maximize the formation of isolated, mononuclear Fe species.
2. Controlling iron loading: Finding the optimal iron concentration to balance activity and selectivity.
3. Investigating acidity effects: Studying the role of Brønsted acid sites in catalyst performance and deactivation.
4. Developing regeneration methods: Exploring techniques to remove coke deposits and restore catalyst activity.
5. Exploring novel zeolite structures: Investigating other zeolite frameworks that may offer improved stability or selectivity.
6. Enhancing iron dispersion: Developing methods to maintain high dispersion of iron species and prevent clustering during reaction.

These research directions could potentially overcome the current limitations and improve the practical viability of N2O-ODHP for industrial propylene production.

使用一氧化二氮（N2O）作为丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）的氧化剂具有以下优势：

1. 更高的丙烯产率：使用铁沸石的N2O-ODHP可实现显著的丙烯产率（22-25%），优于其他氧化剂。

2. 较低的操作温度：该过程在643-773 K下进行，比使用其他氧化剂的混合金属氧化物催化剂所需的823-923 K低得多。

3. 改善的选择性：某些催化剂，特别是蒸汽活化的H-ZSM-5，在使用N2O时表现出高丙烯选择性（高达90%）。

N2O-ODHP中使用的各种催化剂包括：

1. 蒸汽活化的Fe-ZSM-5
2. 液相离子交换的Fe-ZSM-5
3. 化学气相沉积的Fe-ZSM-5
4. 商业H-ZSM-5（含铁杂质）

与催化剂失活和稳定性相关的关键挑战包括：

1. 积碳形成：这导致催化剂通过毒化活性位点或造成孔道堵塞而逐渐失活。
2. 不同的失活速率：不同的催化剂表现出不同的抗失活能力，蒸汽活化的Fe-ZSM-5表现出更好的稳定性。
3. 铁的聚集：大的铁簇促进反应中间体深度氧化为COx，降低选择性。

为解决这些限制并使N2O-ODHP更加可行，可能的策略包括：

1. 优化蒸汽活化：进一步研究蒸汽处理，以最大化孤立的单核Fe物种的形成。
2. 控制铁负载量：寻找最佳铁浓度，以平衡活性和选择性。
3. 研究酸性效应：研究Brønsted酸位点在催化剂性能和失活中的作用。
4. 开发再生方法：探索去除积碳沉积物并恢复催化剂活性的技术。
5. 探索新型沸石结构：研究可能提供更好稳定性或选择性的其他沸石骨架。
6. 提高铁分散度：开发在反应过程中保持铁物种高分散度并防止聚集的方法。

这些研究方向可能有助于克服当前的限制，并提高N2O-ODHP在工业丙烯生产中的实际可行性。
