[1] "A promising alternative system for ODHP arises from the application of iron zeolites using N2O as the oxidant, leading to remarkable propylene yields at a substantially lower operation temperature (643773 K) in comparison with the mixed metal oxides (823923 K)."

[2] "Propylene yields up to 25% were reported by Bula
nek et al. [5] over steamed Fe-ZSM-5 zeolites with significantly lower iron loadings (0.030.12 wt.% Fe)."

[3] "In general, the yield of C3H6 and the conversion of C3H8 over the zeolites decrease with time due to coke formation [4], which leads to a gradual catalyst deactivation."

[4] "Coke makes the active sites inaccessible by poisoning of iron species or causing pore blockage."

[5] "The st-Fe-Z zeolite exhibits a remarkable resistance towards deactivation, showing an increase in propylene yield from 22% to 25% during the first 20 min on stream, which is maintained during 75 min."

[6] "Our results suggest that traces of well-isolated (mononuclear) Fe species released from framework positions by steaming are extremely active in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propylene, while large iron clusters enhance deep oxidation of important reaction intermediates to COx."

N2O as an oxidant in ODHP offers several advantages compared to other oxidants:

1. Lower operation temperature: N2O-ODHP can be carried out at 643-773 K, which is significantly lower than the 823-923 K required for mixed metal oxide catalysts with O2 as the oxidant.

2. High propylene selectivity: Iron zeolite catalysts with N2O can achieve propylene yields up to 25%, with selectivities around 40-90% depending on the catalyst preparation method.

3. Milder oxidant: N2O is a milder oxidant compared to O2, which may contribute to higher selectivity towards propylene by reducing over-oxidation.

The main catalysts employed in N2O-ODHP are iron-containing zeolites, particularly Fe-ZSM-5. Different preparation methods have been studied, including:

1. Hydrothermal synthesis followed by steam activation
2. Liquid-ion exchange
3. Chemical vapor deposition

The critical challenges associated with catalyst deactivation and stability include:

1. Coke formation: The main cause of deactivation, leading to a decrease in propylene yield and propane conversion over time.
2. Poisoning of iron species: Coke deposits can make active sites inaccessible.
3. Pore blockage: Coking can obstruct the zeolite pores, reducing accessibility to active sites.

Strategies to address these limitations and improve N2O-ODHP feasibility:

1. Optimize iron loading and distribution: Focus on creating well-isolated, mononuclear Fe species, which appear to be more active and selective for propylene production.

2. Improve steam activation techniques: Steam treatment has shown to increase catalyst resistance to deactivation and improve propylene selectivity.

3. Control acidity: Investigate the optimal balance between Brønsted acid sites and iron species to minimize coke formation while maintaining high activity.

4. Develop regeneration methods: Research into efficient catalyst regeneration techniques to remove coke deposits and restore activity.

5. Explore novel zeolite structures: Investigate other zeolite frameworks or hierarchical structures that may offer improved mass transfer and resistance to coking.

6. Study the role of promoters: Investigate the addition of promoters that could enhance catalyst stability or selectivity.

7. Optimize reaction conditions: Fine-tune reaction parameters such as temperature, pressure, and feed composition to maximize propylene yield while minimizing coke formation.

8. In-situ characterization: Employ advanced characterization techniques to better understand the nature of active sites and deactivation mechanisms during the reaction.

By addressing these challenges and pursuing these research directions, N2O-ODHP could potentially become a more viable option for industrial propylene production.

N2O作为ODHP的氧化剂与其他氧化剂相比具有以下优势：

1. 较低的操作温度：N2O-ODHP可在643-773 K下进行，显著低于使用O2作为氧化剂的混合金属氧化物催化剂所需的823-923 K。

2. 高丙烯选择性：使用N2O的铁沸石催化剂可实现高达25%的丙烯产率，根据催化剂制备方法的不同，选择性可达40-90%。

3. 更温和的氧化剂：与O2相比，N2O是一种更温和的氧化剂，可能通过减少过度氧化来提高丙烯的选择性。

N2O-ODHP中使用的主要催化剂是含铁的沸石，特别是Fe-ZSM-5。研究了不同的制备方法，包括：

1. 水热合成后蒸汽活化

2. 改进蒸汽活化技术：蒸汽处理已显示可以增加催化剂抗失活能力并提高丙烯选择性。

3. 控制酸度：研究Brønsted酸位点和铁物种之间的最佳平衡，以最小化积碳形成，同时保持高活性。

4. 开发再生方法：研究高效的催化剂再生技术，以去除积碳沉积物并恢复活性。

5. 探索新型沸石结构：研究其他可能提供更好的传质和抗积碳能力的沸石骨架或分级结构。

6. 研究助剂的作用：调查可能增强催化剂稳定性或选择性的助剂添加。

7. 优化反应条件：微调温度、压力和进料组成等反应参数，以最大化丙烯产率，同时最小化积碳形成。

8. 原位表征：采用先进的表征技术，以更好地理解反应过程中活性位点的性质和失活机制。

通过解决这些挑战并追求这些研究方向，N2O-ODHP可能成为更可行的工业丙烯生产选择。
