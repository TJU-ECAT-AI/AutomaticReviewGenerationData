Abstract
Hydrogen sulfide removal is a long-standing economic and environmental challenge faced by the oil and gas industries. H2S separation processes using reactive and non-reactive absorption and adsorption, membranes, and cryogenic distillation are reviewed. A detailed discussion is presented on new developments in adsorbents, such as ionic liquids, metal oxides, metals, metalorganic frameworks, zeolites, carbon-based materials, and composite materials; and membrane technologies for H2S removal. This Review attempts to exhaustively compile the existing literature on sour gas sweetening and to identify promising areas for future developments in the field.

1 Introduction
Hydrogen sulfide (H2S) is a colorless gas with a characteristic odor of rotten eggs. It is highly toxic, corrosive, and flammable in nature. Since H2S is heavier than air, it has a tendency to settle in low-lying and poorly ventilated areas (see Table 1 for the properties of H2S). It causes irritation to the eyes, nose, and throat at concentrations as low as 5 ppm and is fatal over 1000 ppm. (1) Inhalation is the primary route for H2S exposure. At 30 ppm, H2S paralyzes the sense of smell and is rapidly absorbed by the blood, resulting in poor oxygen uptake at the cellular level. Therefore, one should not fully trust their sense of smell for the presence of H2S because alarming concentrations may be present with no perceivable odor. Handling of H2S requires stringent safety regulations such as trained personnel, complete set of personal protective equipment including a gas mask, strategically located sensors, and emergency evacuation plans. Experimental studies with H2S at concentrations of a few hundred parts per million are challenging enough; the challenge is even greater at the percentage-level concentrations in actual gas-processing facilities.

H2S occurs naturally, at varied concentrations, in various hydrocarbon sources such as crude petroleum, natural gas, and biogas (see Table 2). It is also formed by the hydrolysis reaction of metal sulfides present in volcanic rocks. Anaerobic respiration of sulfate-reducing bacteria, whereby these organisms breathe sulfate to derive energy and release sulfide as waste, constitutes another major natural source of H2S. Landfills, rotten vegetation, and composting sites can also contribute to H2S generation; caution should be exercised in dealing with these not-so-obvious sources of H2S.

Anthropogenically, the main source of H2S is in oil refineries, wherein desulfurization of various gas streams using hydrogen gas generates H2S (also known as hydrodesulfurization). This process is essential to reduce the sulfur content of automobile and heating fuels, since combustion of sulfur compounds will result in emission of harmful sulfur oxides to the atmosphere that can, in turn, give rise to acid rain. Hydrodesulfurization is also important since sulfur compounds, often at very low concentrations, can deactivate noble metal catalysts for downstream catalytic reforming units. Gasification of coal and biomass for syngas (CO + H2) production, under high temperature and low oxygen concentrations, results in a conversion of the sulfur content of these resources into H2S.
For any of the hydrocarbon streams, such as natural gas, biogas, or syngas, to be useful for energy generation or chemicals production, they need to be purified to remove unacceptable amounts of acid gases such as H2S and CO2. The acceptable H2S levels can be quite different depending on the end use; for example, 515 ppm H2S is acceptable in natural gas depending on the country of use, but <1 ppm H2S is required for fuel cell applications, where the electrodes are very susceptible to sulfur poisoning. The magnitudes of different streams that are processed globally are also quite different: for instance, over 120 trillion standard cubic feet (scf) of natural gas is produced each year, while only about 1 trillion scf of biogas is produced annually. The optimal materials and processes for H2S removal from different sources and for different end applications can be quite different. In this Review, we will focus more on the technical aspects of the different alternative methods and processes. Detailed economic analysis of competing H2S-removal processes for specific feeds and applications is beyond the scope of this Review. While there is a significant overlap in materials for different H2S-capture problems, we will base our discussions mainly in the context of natural gas purification.
Raw natural gas is a complex mixture of methane (CH4), ethane, and other light alkanes, H2S, carbon dioxide (CO2), nitrogen, and water (H2O) vapor. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency classifies natural gas as sour at H2S concentrations above 4 ppm; (5)sweetening refers to removal of acidic sulfur compounds, primarily H2S. Natural gas emerging at the reservoir well head is subjected to low temperatures to condense out heavier hydrocarbons (see Figure 1). Overhead vapors are sent to the acid gas removal unit to selectively strip off H2S and CO2; amine-based absorption is most commonly used for this step. The H2S-rich stream is sent to the sulfur recovery unit (SRU), while the CH4-rich stream, after some post-processing steps such as dehydration, is sent to the pipeline as sales gas. In the SRU, sulfur is recovered by the well-known Claus process, where H2S undergoes high-temperature (1000 C) thermal oxidation,
(1)
prior to low-temperature (200300 C) catalytic oxidation,
(2)
(ΔH data from ref 6), in a series of reactors at progressively lower temperatures, accompanied by sulfur removal in intermediate condensers. Since the melting point of elemental sulfur is 115 C and sulfur deposition leads to catalyst deactivation, the temperature of the final Claus reactor is generally maintained above 200 C. This results in an incomplete conversion of H2S, and the resulting gas stream is sent to the tail gas treatment unit for additional sulfur recovery before the waste gases are released to the atmosphere. Thus, highly sour natural gas is usually processed for H2S removal in two different units, at two very different concentrations.

In addition to other papers in this special issue, Chemical Reviews has published three papers on the subject of CO2 capture in the past 5 years: Sumida et al. reviewed CO2 capture in metalorganic frameworks (MOFs), (7) Pera-Titus reviewed the capture process using porous inorganic membranes, (8) and Sanz-Prez et al. focused on chemical sorbents for the direct capture of CO2 from air. (9) However, similar reviews on H2S capture are few and limited in scope. (-10-16) Abatzoglou and Boivin reviewed biogas purification processes for removal of contaminants such as H2S, NH3, and siloxanes. (11) They divided the purification methods into two generic categories: those involving physicochemical phenomena and those involving biological processes. Most biotechnologies still require further optimization and scale-up in order to compete with their physical/chemical counterparts. (17) We will focus here on the physicochemical techniques for selective H2S removal; the reader interested in microbiological alternatives is referred to earlier reviews on the subject. (18, 19) The abundant literature available on H2S removal may be broadly classified into four categories: absorption, adsorption, membranes, and cryogenic distillation (see Figure 2). In this Review, we focus on materials and chemistries involved in each of these processes. Extensive review articles focus on solutions to tackle concentrated H2S by methods like the Claus process (20-22) or the production of hydrogen from H2S, (23) and these are not considered here.

Since H2S is a polar molecule, while CH4 is a nonpolar molecule, it is obvious to imagine a polar solvent or a polar adsorbent surface to carry out this separation. However, the presence of other polar natural gas impurities such as H2O, which has a dipole moment about twice that of H2S, presents challenges to a simple polarity-based CH4/H2S separation. Exploiting the higher acidity of H2S compared to that of H2O using basic chemicals such as amines is also an alternative for sour gas sweetening. However, this principle of separation also suffers from some limitations due to the acidity of CO2 being higher than that of H2S and the concentration of CO2 in natural gas being generally much higher than that of H2S. The kinetic diameter of CH4 (3.8 Å) is slightly larger than that of H2S (3.6 Å); this might be another property that can be exploited for this particular gas separation using nanoporous adsorbents or membranes. Thus, while several possible solutions exist, challenges are associated with each of them, and it is important to evaluate these on a case-by-case basis.
2 Absorption
The natural gas industry has relied on gas absorption for purification of raw natural gas for nearly 100 years, and this separation technique dominates most sour gas separations around the globe even today. A variety of different liquid solvents have been employed in a tray or a packed-bed configuration to selectively absorb H2S and CO2 from CH4 and light alkanes. Depending on the strength of interaction of gas molecules with the solvent and the nature of the absorption isotherm, these solvents maybe broadly classified into chemical and physical categories. For chemisorption, solubility of the gas in the liquid increases sharply at very low pressures and starts to plateau at higher pressures; the plateau is indicative of the stoichiometric capacity for the chemical reaction. In physisorption, the plateau is shifted to much higher pressures, and in many cases there is no plateau for the pressure range of interest, so solubility continues to increase, more or less linearly, with pressure. A sharp distinction between these categories does not exist (e.g., hydrogen bonding and weak charge transfer), and in reality, all solutesolvent combinations have some contribution from physisorption. For sour gas sweetening, alkanolamines are the most widely used class of chemical solvents. All other solvents usually absorb the gas physically, and their very high capacities make them of interest if a feed with high acid gas partial pressure is available.
2.1 Alkanolamines
Bottoms for the first time, in 1930, developed an absorption process for acid gases using alkanolamine solutions. (24) For several years, diethanolamine (DEA) was commonly used in refineries to remove acid gases. However, not only do H2S and CO2 concentrations in raw natural gas vary over a wide range of concentrations, but also since the toxicity of H2S is much higher than that of CO2, the upper-bound specifications for these impurities in the pipeline gas are also quite different (4 ppm for H2S and 2% for CO2). Clearly, the extent of H2S and CO2 removal required can be very different too. For example, nearly complete removal of H2S without any major removal of CO2 is desired for a feed gas containing high H2S concentration but CO2 concentration being already at 2%. Traditional alkanolamines absorb CO2 in preference to H2S; Frazier and Kohl first proposed the use of tertiary amines such as methyldiethanolamine (MDEA) for selective removal of H2S. (25) The CO2tertiary amine reaction,
(3)
proceeding via the bicarbonate formation, is relatively slow compared with the CO2primary and CO2secondary amine reactions, resulting in a carbamate ion,
(4)
while the H2Stertiary amine reaction, like all other amines, involves a proton transfer and is faster, (26)
(5)
MDEA not only offers kinetic selectivity toward H2S but also allows an equilibrium that favors the absorption of H2S over CO2. (25, 27)
Besides MDEA, diisopropanolamine (DIPA), which is used in the Adip process developed by Shell, has also been reported to have a greater selectivity for H2S over CO2 than either monoethanolamine (MEA) or DEA. (28) In 1983, Sartori et al. investigated 2-amino-2-methyl-1-propanol (AMP), a sterically hindered amine, for CO2 removal at Exxon Research and Engineering Company. (29) Introducing steric hindrance by a bulky substituent adjacent to the amino group lowers the stability of the carbamate formed by the CO2amine reaction. Using kinetic modeling, the authors described as to how decreased carbamate stability leads to higher thermodynamic CO2 loadings approaching 1 mol of CO2 per mole of amine. Additionally, this leads to a higher free-amine concentration; therefore fast CO2amine reaction rates are obtained despite some reduction of the rate constant owing to steric interference. These hindered amines were found to be selective toward H2S over CO2 and have been commercialized as the Flexsorb process by Exxon Research and Engineering Company. It is claimed that the new hindered amine-based processes are potentially attractive replacements for the existing selective H2S removal processes, including the MDEA-based process. (28)
Thorough knowledge of the vaporliquid equilibria for a gas/liquid combination is a prerequisite for accurate design of absorption columns. Classical thermodynamic modeling of acid gas absorption in aqueous alkanolamines, using either semi-empirical equilibrium constant approaches or activity coefficient methods, has been a subject of interest since the 1930s. Recently, Suleman et al. reviewed these models, discussing their classification, chronological development, salient features, and recommendations of appropriate models depending on the pressure and loading of the acid gases. (30)
2.2 Methanol
The Rectisol process, developed independently by Linde and Lurgi in the late 1950s, involves physical absorption using methanol at temperatures between 40 and 60 C. Since methanol has a low viscosity, it can be used for very low-temperature absorption processes, in particular for feeds with low partial pressures of acid gases. Since the high vapor pressure of methanol demands washing of all streams with liquid water in order to recover the methanol vapors, all streams are humidified during the process; the purified gas stream will also be humidified, thus requiring an additional step to meet the upper-bound H2O specifications for natural gas. The main application for the Rectisol process is purification of syngas derived from the gasification of heavy oil and coal rather than natural gas treating applications. (31) The multi-stage Ifpexol process, developed by Institut Francais du Petrole, can be used for natural gas applications. (32) Physical properties of various commercially used physical solvents for gas sweetening are listed in Table 3. (33, 34)

2.3 N-Methyl-2-pyrrolidone
Like the Rectisol process, the Purisol process is also a physical absorption process based on N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP). However, due to its much lower vapor pressure, it can be operated at relatively higher temperatures without excessive solvent loss. Its operation at sub-ambient temperatures allows for simultaneous water removal since water is not required to wash the treated gas stream for solvent (NMP) recovery. Various advantages and limitations of the Rectisol and Purisol processes are covered in great detail elsewhere. (34, 35)
2.4 Poly(ethylene glycol) Dimethyl Ether
Poly(ethylene glycol) dimethyl ether (PEGDME) is a mixture of CH3O(CH2CH2O)nCH3 oligomers with n = 29. Compared to the other solvents, PEGDME has a higher viscosity, which reduces mass-transfer rates and tray efficiencies and increases packing or tray requirements, especially at reduced temperatures. (34) However, it benefits from lower solvent vapor pressure, which prevents solvent losses in various streams, thus eliminating the need for water wash to recover the solvent and allowing for simultaneous dehydration of the feed to the desired dew point of sales gas. The Selexol process, developed by Allied Chemical Corporation, was first utilized in 1970.
2.5 Sulfolane and Diisopropanolamine
Unlike other physical solvents such as methanol, sulfolane are rarely used alone but rather in admixture with a chemical solvent such as an alkanolamine solution. (36) Shell Oils Sulfinol process, first developed by Dunn et al. in 1964, employs a mixed solvent consisting of DIPA, sulfolane, and water. (37) The presence of the physical solvent appreciably enhances the solution capacity, especially when the gas stream to be treated is available at high pressure and the acidic components are present in high concentrations. (38) There have been several subsequent studies to improve the chemical solvent; one such candidate is MDEA, a tertiary amine that has thermodynamic and kinetic selectivity toward H2S in the presence of CO2. (39-41) Currently, three different solvents are available for the Sulfinol process: Sulfinol-X consists of MDEA and piperazine, Sulfinol-M consists of MDEA, and Sulfinol-D consists of DIPA. (42)
2.6 Ionic Liquids
Ionic liquids (ILs) are salts having moderately low melting points (<100 C), with their ionic character imparting them a large cohesive energy in the liquid phase, which in turn results in extremely low vapor pressures over a wide temperature range. This is a benefit for absorptive gas separation since the loss of solvent to the gas stream can be minimized. Additionally, many ILs are thermally very stable and are less combustible than other absorbents. Typically, an IL comprises a large, low-symmetry organic cation derived by alkyl substitution on parent cations such as imidazolium, pyridinium, ammonium, and phosphonium and an inorganic or organic anion such as tetrafluoroborate, hexafluorophosphate, acetate, methyl sulfate, ethyl sulfate, triflate, etc. (43) Due to their polar character, ILs show a high affinity for polar molecules such as H2O, CO2, and H2S, while nonpolar molecules like CH4 and other alkanes exhibit a much smaller solubility. In this section, we will discuss various advantages and shortcomings of ILs for H2S capture. The reader is also referred to earlier reviews on the subject. (44-46)
Jou and Mather first investigated H2S absorption in an IL, 1-N-butyl-3-methylimidazolium hexafluorophosphate ([bmim+][PF6]), and observed that H2S only physisorbed to the IL. (47) This further suggests that ILs are unlikely to replace alkanolamines completely but may be useful either for the bulk removal of high-partial-pressure acid gases or for mixing with a chemical solvent to increase capacity. Pomelli et al. extended this investigation to a wide range of cations and anions and demonstrated ILs with extremely high H2S solubilities. (62) They also carried out gas-phase electronic structure calculations elucidating the strong binding of H2S to the anion of the IL, with interaction energies of these complexes in the range of 3060 kJ/mol, indicating traditional hydrogen bonds. Experimental data for the Henrys law constants for H2S, CO2, and CH4 in various ILs are summarized in Table 4.

Since sorption experiments are much more difficult to conduct for gas mixtures than for pure gases, an assumption needs to be invoked for defining absorption selectivity. There are at least two possible ways to define ideal absorption selectivity that have been used in the literature: (i) ratio of the solubilities at infinite dilution (Henrys law coefficients) and (ii) computing a mixture selectivity,
(6)
assuming that the amount absorbed for a mixture at a given partial pressure is equal to that for a pure case at the same total pressure. The answers obtained from the two definitions can be quite different. In order to assess the validity of ideal absorption selectivity approximation, Singh et al. (63) carried out molecular simulations for mixture absorption of CO2/H2 in [C4mim+][Tf2N] and [C6mim+][Tf2N] and found that definition (ii) for selectivity is in much better agreement with mixture selectivity. For CO2/CH4 absorption in [C4mim+][Tf2N], Budhathoki et al. observed definition (i) to be in better agreement with the mixture selectivity. (64) These differences demonstrate a lack of quantitative predictive capabilities to determine mixture absorption from pure-component data and suggest that either mixture measurements or mixture simulations with reliable force fields should indeed be carried out for at least the more promising ILs.
Trends in affinity of H2S toward the anion of the IL were found to depend on the cation under consideration: [emim+][Tf2N] > [emim+][PF6], (56) [bmim+][Tf2N] > [bmim+][BF4] > [bmim+][PF6], (49) [hmim+][BF4] > [hmim+][PF6]  [hmim+][Tf2N], (52) and [hemim+][Tf2N]  [hemim+][OTf] > [hemim+][PF6] > [hemim+][BF4]. (54) These results indicate that H2S solubility is affected by both the cation and the anion of the IL, and it may not be possible to find the best anion and the best cation without trying all possible pairs. With the aid of molecular simulations, deeper insights can be gained about the entropic and enthalpic contributions of H2S solubilities in different ILs. Recently, Snchez-Badillo and co-workers computed solvation thermodynamics of H2S in ILs and demonstrated qualitative agreement with experimental data. (65) These calculations showed that, at room temperature, the absolute solvation enthalpy is 2 times higher than the absolute entropic contribution for [bmim+][PF6] and [bmim+][BF4] and 3 times higher for [bmim+][Cl]. The solubility of H2S in [bmim+][Tf2N] from molecular simulations was shown to be sensitive to the choice of the H2S force field; the TraPPE model resulted in the most accurate predictions. (66, 67) Jalili et al. also studied [C8mim+][Tf2N] and found that the solubility of H2S in [Cnmim+][Tf2N] ILs increases as the number of carbon atoms in the alkyl substituent of the methylimidazolium cation, n, increases. (58) The authors explained that since the molar volume of the IL increases with n, possibly due to poorer interactions between bulkier cations and the anion, higher free volumes may result, in turn increasing the solubility. One must remember that such increased acid gas solubility due to increased free volumes will also lead to increased CH4 solubility, in turn reducing SH2S/CH4. As described previously with regard to how the necessity for selective H2S over CO2 absorption led to the development of absorbents such as MDEA, new solvents with SH2S/CO2 > 1 that also exert a low vapor pressure to reduce solvent losses will be interesting targets, and ILs, with their tunable polarity, can be ground-breaking candidates to achieve this selectivity. (68) Investigations of ternary systems consisting of H2S, CO2, and [C8mim+][Tf2N] showed SH2S/CO2  3 under ambient pressure and temperature. (58)
All the studies conducted so far focused only on H2S and not on CH4 absorption. After all, for gas sweetening, selectivity is more important than solubility alone. Carvalho et al. suggested that the solubility of H2S in ILs is governed predominantly by entropic effects and that the most promising approach to enhance the sour gases/CH4 selectivities at high pressures is by lowering the methane solubility in ILs and not by increasing the sour gas solubility, which is essentially dependent on the solvent molar volume. (69) These authors measured CH4 solubility in four different ILs and demonstrated that it was highly dependent on the polarity of the IL and that, contrary to the previous selectivity models in the literature, (70, 71) the molar volume of the IL alone was not a sufficient criterion to tune selectivity. (72)
While high solubility and selectivity for the desired molecule form the prerequisites for an IL to be useful for separation purposes, additional criteria such as thermal and mass transport through the IL can also contribute to the overall operating cost of the absorber. Due to their high cohesive energies, ILs demonstrate high viscosities, 13 orders of magnitude higher than for the conventional solvents. (73) Higher viscosities imply higher power consumption for gasliquid contact, but also an unusual possibility for diffusion-based selectivity in a gasliquid system. Under such circumstances, it will be helpful if the diffusivity of H2S is higher than that of CO2 in order to benefit from a transport selectivity. Reports investigating the diffusion of acid gases in ILs are limited. (55, 57, 74) At room temperature, [emim+][EtSO4] shows a high diffusion selectivity,  40, while [hemim+][BF4] shows  1.
In 2002, Bates et al. first reported an IL designed for CO2 capture (task-specific ionic liquids (TSILs)) where a primary amine moiety is covalently tethered to an imidazolium cation for enhanced interaction with CO2. (75) Huang et al. employed carboxylate-based ILs for H2S capture, the Lewis base character of which resulted in higher absorption capacities. (59) These ILs absorb about 0.3 mol of H2S per mole of IL under ambient pressure at 60 C, about 15 times higher than conventional ILs. The enthalpy of this reactive absorption varies between 30 and 65 kJ/mol, depending on the cation and the anion, but is still lower than typical enthalpies of absorption in alkanolamines (80 kJ/mol). However, in spite of these favorable characteristics, the SH2S/CO2 in the carboxylate ILs is even worse than in the normal ILs due to the strong affinity of carboxylate ions toward CO2. (76) This challenge was overcome with the design of dual Lewis base functionalized ILs (DLB-ILs), (77) which have a tertiary amine group tethered to the carboxylate anion. It was found that the DLB-ILs could reversibly absorb 0.390.84 mol of H2S per mole of IL at 1 bar and 60 C, which is significantly higher than for other ILs. These DLB-ILs show SH2S/CO2  20 at 1 bar and SH2S/CO2 > 100 at pressures less than 0.1 bar. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations demonstrated the favorable geometry and energetics of the carboxylateH2Samine complex and the reduced CO2IL binding.
Although TSILs can be modified for high H2S capacity and SH2S/CO2, their high costs and viscosity disfavor their application in industry. (60) This limitation encouraged the same authors to explore protic ionic liquid (PILs), which are a class of low-cost ILs that can be easily prepared from simple materials through direct neutralization between the corresponding acid and base. (60, 78) For instance, mixing dimethylethanolamine and acetic acid yields dimethylethanolammonium acetate ([DMEAH][Ac]). It was demonstrated that [DMEAH][Ac] and dimethylethanolammonium formate ([DMEAH][For]) have SH2S/CO2 greater than those of normal ILs and any other organic solvent.
Another issue with TSILs is that they are highly hydrophilic and miscible with water, thus increasing the expense of regeneration by requiring energy for removing bound water. Both the cation and anion can affect the mutual solubilities between water and ILs, but the anion plays the major role in determining their phase behavior. (79) Huang et al. (61) synthesized half-protonated diamines with a free tertiary amine group (disfavoring CO2) tethered on the cations and bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide ([Tf2N]) as the anion, which is a well-known building block for hydrophobic ILs with low viscosity. (79) Although these ILs have H2S absorption capacity similar to that of other TSILs reported in the literature on a mole ratio basis, they have a molecular weight nearly twice that of other TSILs, making capacity on molality basis (per mass of IL) nearly half.
As described earlier, compared to common organic solvents with high vapor pressures, ILs contribute negligible volatile organic compounds to the atmosphere, thus reducing the issue of atmospheric emissions. However, it has been noted in the literature that most ILs are not intrinsically green, (80) and similar to other commercial organic solvents, irresponsible release of them will pose a threat to the environment. One of the key issues here is that, unlike the common solvents, the toxicity of ILs is not fully characterized. However, at least in principle, the large design space of ILs should allow for designing solvents that not only are effective for the application of interest but also pose no serious ecological threat. In an attempt to explore environmentally benign solvents, Guo et al. synthesized and measured H2S absorption in a series of caprolactam tetrabutylammonium bromide (CPLTBAB) ILs with different mole ratios of CPL and TBAB. (81) For the 1:1 CPLTBAB mixture, the solubilities of pure H2S at atmospheric pressure are 0.69 and 0.44 mol of H2S per mole of IL at 30 and 90 C, respectively.
Heldebrant et al. developed a new class of CO2-binding organic liquids (CO2BOLs) that chemically and reversibly absorb CO2. (82) These organic liquids are mixtures of organic alcohols and amidine/guanidine bases. Since these organic liquids have lower specific heats compared to H2O and also since they require much lower regeneration temperatures, a higher energy efficiency can be achieved during absorption/regeneration cycles. Following on the capture of acid gases such as CO2, SO2, CS2, and COS using such organic liquids, (82, 83) it was hypothesized that weak bases such as tertiary alkanolamines (anhydrous) could react with H2S to form liquid hydrosulfide salts that could be used as reversible H2S-binding organic liquids (H2SBOLs). (84) These authors demonstrated desorption of H2S by either inert gas sparging or mild heating, or even at room temperature by the addition of low-specific-heat antisolvents such as hexanes that can be boiled at 5070 C. BOLs are non-ionic before reacting with the gas molecule; however, after chemically reacting with the gas, they become ILs.
Very similar in properties to ILs, deep eutectic solvents (DESs) are a relatively new class of solvents that are formed by complexing a large, asymmetric quaternary ammonium salt with a metal salt or a hydrogen bond donor. (85) Hydrogen bonding in the system results in charge delocalization, thus lowering the lattice energy and decreasing the melting point of the mixture relative to the melting points of the individual components. (86) In addition to most of the better solvent properties of ILs, DESs are generally more biodegradable, less toxic, and inexpensive, thus making these solvents more sustainable. Articles on CO2 capture using DESs have started to appear in the past few years, (87, 88) and CO2 removal from natural gas was reviewed recently. (89) To the best of our knowledge, there is no report in the literature on H2S capture, and this might be an unexplored opportunity to discover novel solvents for this application.
Since 2010, several research groups have started to focus on equations of state (EoS) modeling of H2S + ILs phase behavior. (90-98) A major drawback in the use of the most prevalent cubic EoS is that they require critical parameters of the ILs that can only be obtained indirectly and with large uncertainties, limiting their utility to correlation purposes only. (99) In contrast, contributions from various energetic interactions, such as dipoledipole, quadrupolequadrupole, and dipolequadrupole, can be explicitly included in a class of equations based on the statistical associating fluid theory (SAFT) formalism. (90, 92) Several other correlation techniques that use molecular weight, critical temperature and pressure, and acentric factor as input variables have been applied to H2S absorption in ILs. (100-103) Group contribution methods, requiring only the number and type of each fragment type as the input, were used to establish a comprehensive database on the solubility of H2S in ILs using 1334 pieces of data covering the period from 2007 to 2016. (104)
Lei et al. employed the conductor-like screening model for real solvents (COSMO-RS) to predict the solubilities of different gases, including H2S, in ILs and observed deviations of less than 40%. (43) This approach requires only the molecular structure and is independent of any experimental correlation. In another study, Mortazavi-Manesh et al. used COSMO-RS to screen 425 ILs for sour gas separations and, based on binary selectivities, suggested 58 promising ILs with H2S/CH4, H2S/C2H6, and H2S/CO2 selectivities in the ranges 5175, 1123, and 2.63.4, respectively. (105)
In 1977, Tennyson and Schaaf provided some guidelines for the choice of appropriate physical/chemical solvent depending on the partial pressures of acid gases in the feed and product gas streams. (106) Process optimization for absorption using ILs in comparison to the commercial solvents can help identify the partial pressure regimes under which certain ILs may be preferred over conventional solvents. The past decade has seen several reports demonstrating high H2SIL affinities, but ILs for selective acid gas removal are still in the design stage. Several design variables, such as length of the alkyl chains on the cation, branching of the alkyl chain, task-specific functional groups, pairing with appropriate anions, etc., make this a multi-dimensional combinatorial problem. As is shown in several fundamental studies for discovery of novel solid adsorbents, insights from molecular simulations can potentially speed up discovery of optimal ILs and DESs for H2S capture. Additionally, simulations can also help understand the differences between selectivities calculated from pure-component absorption isotherms and those observed in an actual mixture measurement. In conclusion, while ILs enjoy clear advantages such as design flexibility and negligible vapor pressures, properties such as viscosity, diffusivity, thermal conductivity, and reaction kinetics in ILs under varying temperatures and partial pressures of acid gases require thorough investigations in order to compare these new solvents with the conventional solvents that have been successfully commercialized for several decades.
3 Adsorption
Adsorptive separation involves the use of a selective and high-capacity solid substrate that shows a preferential affinity for one or more molecule types from their mixtures. Similar to absorption, adsorption may also be classified as physisorption and chemisorption, depending on the strength of sorbatesorbent interactions. In addition to interaction-based separation, different sizes and shapes of molecules can also be exploited for selective removal of one compound over another. In this section, we will discuss a variety of adsorbents, such as metal oxides, MOFs, zeolites, carbons, and composite materials, for H2S capture from gas mixtures containing CH4, CO2, N2, H2, and/or H2O. For any adsorption application, it is desirable that the adsorbent has a high separation selectivity for the molecule of interest (primarily H2S in this case) and also a high capacity for the adsorbate. In addition to capacity and selectivity, stability under extreme acid gas environments as well as performance and structural regenerability are important for longer lifetime of the adsorbent bed.
3.1 Metal Oxides
Since the 1960s, metal oxides have been used for desulfurization of coal gas, syngas, hydrogen for fuel cells, and Claus tail gas. (107, 108) Metal oxides for hot-gas desulfurization have been investigated extensively; (109, 110) this large body of literature is beyond the scope of this Review, and we focus here mostly on low to moderate temperatures (25300 C) that are of relevance to natural gas sweetening, including the Claus tail gas.
In 1976, Westmoreland and Harrison screened for the high-temperature (4001200 C) desulfurization potential of oxides of 28 elements with computational free energy minimizations of a C-H-N-O-S elemental system in the presence of the metal oxide using temperature-dependent free energies from the literature. (111) Eleven candidate solids, based upon the metals Fe, Zn, Mo, Mn, V, Ca, Sr, Ba, Co, Cu, and W, showed thermodynamic feasibility (at least 95% desulfurization and solid stability) for high-temperature desulfurization. Another simulation study at 400 C with feed containing 12.5% CO2, 42.5% CO, 32.175% H2, 12.5% H2O, and 3250 ppm H2S showed that oxides of Zn, Mo, Mn, W, Sn, Co, Cu, Ni, and Fe should be successful in reducing the residual H2S content to 0.03, 0.6, 2.5, 3.4, 19, 24, 39, 41, and 91 ppm, respectively. (112)
Rodriguez et al. studied adsorption of H2S on a series of metal oxide surfaces using synchrotron-based high-resolution photoemission. (113, 114) It was observed that the smaller the band gap in the oxide, the bigger its reactivity toward S-containing molecules (see Figure 3). Ab initio self-consistent field (SCF) theory calculations and experimental data indicated that the reactivity of an oxide mainly depends on how well its bands mix with the orbitals of H2S or HS. (113) Oxides possessing a large ionicity, like Al2O3 and MgO, displayed the lowest reactivity toward H2S, indicating that the electrostatic interactions between the dipole of H2S and the ionic field generated by the charges in an oxide may play only a secondary role in the adsorption process. (114) As can be seen from Figure 3, Cr3O4 interacts strongly with H2S. Even before this study, the most significant evolution of the Claus process, the Superclaus process, employed an α-alumina support coated with a mixture of iron and chromium oxides as the catalyst. (115) However, due to the severe toxicity of chromia, continuing research to develop new catalysts for this important reaction is underway. (116) CuO and Cu2O have band gaps of 1.2 and 2.1 eV, respectively; the contribution by Rodriguez et al. should imply better desulfurization using CuO compared to Cu2O. Room-temperature experimental screening of oxides of Ag, Cu, Zn, Co, Ni, Ca, Mn, and Sn showed a conversion of 66% for CuO but <10% for the other oxides. (117)

Several DFT studies on H2S reaction with oxides of Zn, (118, 119) Fe, (120) Ce, (121) Ti, (122) Mn, (123) V, (124, 125) Cu, (126, 127) Co, (128) and Mg (129) have been carried out in the past decade. While these studies provide some details of possible reaction mechanisms for each metal oxide, a comparative study of different pure and mixed oxides for adsorption and regeneration from first-principles calculations, at the same level of theory, can provide insights into optimal metal oxide selection. Jia et al. carried out a comparative study of the reactions of MmOn (M = Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, and Zn) with H2S using mass spectrometry and DFT calculations. (130) The authors tested several density functionals by calculating the bond enthalpies of MO, MS, HSH, and SH species, and except for ZnS, the B3LYP functional was found to be generally in better agreement with the experimental enthalpies.
Adsorption of H2S by ZnO is stoichiometric at 350 C but falls off rapidly as the temperature is reduced. (131) Since this is an exothermic reaction, this decline in conversion is due to slower reaction kinetics. Baird et al. reported 91% conversion of Co3O4 at room temperature, (132) while Xue et al. reported only a 1% conversion. (117) These studies suggest the possible implications of synthesis recipes on the size, shape, and surface area of the metal oxide particles that can, in turn affect the H2S breakthrough capacity. In fact, there are several reports exploring desulfurization using different ZnO morphologies. (133-138) While it is hard to draw a head-to-head comparison between independent studies due to different gas velocities, reactor volume, feed compositions, and definitions of breakthrough concentration, data for these are compiled in Table 5. The % utilization for a metal oxide-based adsorbent is defined as the ratio of the actual amount of H2S adsorbed to the theoretical amount of H2S adsorbed by complete conversion of metal oxide to metal sulfide, multiplied by 100. Note that the value can change depending on the choice of the oxidation state of the metal in its oxide and sulfide forms. This number can be greater than 100 due to H2S adsorbing without chemical reaction with the metal oxide (see, for instance, the H2S adsorption on metal oxides impregnated on high-surface-area silica supports).

The reaction between H2S and a metal oxide in the absence of O2 belongs to the class of non-catalytic gassolid reactions. These reactions have been most commonly analyzed using either the unreacted shrinking core model (USCM) (139) or the grain model. (140) USCM is built on the assumption that the reaction is much faster than the diffusion and, hence, the reaction occurs at the solid reactant surface. This model clearly assumes inward propagation of the reaction front. In the grain model, each of the large number of spherical grains in a solid pellet is assumed to react independently according to the USCM. Early reports on sulfidation kinetics of ZnO, employing the grain model with constant or varying properties (size changes due to sintering and reaction) of the adsorbent, agreed quantitatively with experiments. (141, 142)
From the time when empirical commercialization of ZnO as a desulfurization sorbent took precedence until the early 1990s, very little was known about the structural changes and the mechanism for this reaction. Using in situ sulfur K-edge X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) in the soft X-ray region (<5000 eV), Evans and co-workers first showed that the reaction of ZnO and H2S occurs via island formation of ZnS on the oxide surface and, as the reaction proceeds, eventually bulk regions of ZnS are formed. (143, 144) Since there was no apparent shift in the edge energies of the S K-edge spectra, it was concluded that the oxidation state of the sulfur remains as S2 throughout the process. (143) The X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and X-ray diffraction (XRD) data for the final states of the adsorbent confirmed the theory of a two-phase material consisting of crystalline ZnO (wurtzite) and a less ordered phase of ZnS (wurtzite), in spite of the fact that ZnS blend structure is thermodynamically more stable. (144) The reader is also referred to a review paper by Samokhvalov et al. on the low-temperature desulfurization using ZnO. (145)
Until recently, ZnO sulfidation models assumed inward diffusion of H2S, but Neveux et al. showed evidence for an outward growth mechanism (see Figure 4). (146, 147) Using transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and electron tomography, the authors observed voids inside the ZnS particle, suggesting that the Zn2+ and O2 species diffuse through the product ZnS layer. Since the external particle surface increases during the course of the reaction, the decrease in reaction rate with time cannot be explained if the rate-determining step (RDS) is located at the external surface (adsorption, desorption, external interface reaction). Thus, the authors proposed that diffusion through the ZnS layer is most likely to be the RDS. Eight elementary steps of the sulfidation reaction were proposed, with the outward growth of ZnS and diffusion of zinc and oxygen through ZnS. (147) The authors derived a rate expression that also considered the evolution of the voids by a nucleationgrowth mechanism, and the model predictions agreed quantitatively with experiments.

To enhance the H2S capacity at lower temperatures, another approach of varying the ZnO morphology involves doping with other metallic species (see Table 6). (117, 131, 132, 148-153) Skrzypski et al. studied mixed CuZn oxides and found a 6-fold increase in capacity at 200 C by doping 6 mol% Cu. (148) XPS of pristine Cu0.03Zn0.97O showed a Cu 2p3/2 peak (933.5 eV), characteristic of Cu2+ surrounded by oxygen; after only partial sulfidation, this peak shifted to lower energy (932.6 eV), indicating the appearance of Cu+ in a sulfide environment. The sulfidation mechanism of these mixed oxides was further investigated using TEM and in situ synchrotron XRD. (150) While non-doped ZnO at 250 C resulted in void formation at the ZnO/ZnS interface, Cu-doped ZnO showed no cavity formation; this suggests an inward growth mechanism where S2 anions diffuse from the external surface to the internal ZnO/ZnS interface and exchange with O2 anions. This radical change in mechanism was attributed to the presence of sulfur vacancies in the ZnS layer due to partial replacement of Zn2+ by Cu+; these anionic vacancies accelerate the diffusion of sulfur to yield higher conversions of CuZn oxides. XRD measurements showed that the size of the ZnS crystallites formed from non-doped ZnO remains constant during the reaction. In contrast, the pronounced growth of Cu-doped samples enhances the mobility of sulfur anions in Cu-containing ZnS particles.

Jiang et al. also studied CuZn and CuZnAl mixed metal oxides prepared via co-precipitation (cp) or multi-precipitation (mp) methods. (149) Better dispersion by aluminum results in smaller mean crystalline sizes and higher specific surface area of Al-containing sorbents; breakthrough sulfur capacities also improve as a result of reducing the thickness of the potential sulfide shell on the outer layer of the oxide, in turn reducing the diffusion path length. The Cu-rich adsorbents were more suitable for H2S adsorption than the Zn-rich adsorbents, with mp-Cu80Zn10Al10 reaching nearly complete conversion at 80 C. XRD of sulfidated samples revealed that the CuS peaks were much more dominant compared to the CuO peaks, but high-intensity ZnO peaks persisted for sulfidated Zn-rich samples. This suggests that CuS penetrated deep into the crystal, while ZnS likely formed only surface layers. Since the anionic sites in ZnO need to rearrange from hexagonal to cubic lattice on sulfidation, while those in CuO need only to transform from monoclinic to hexagonal, a faster sulfidation rate was proposed for CuO than that for ZnO. Similar structural arguments were invoked for ZnCo oxides (discussed below) by Baird et al. (132) It should be noted here that the sulfidation reaction in the study by Jiang et al. was carried out at 40 C, (149) as opposed to a much higher temperature (370 C) in the study by Hayter et al. (discussed above) (144) that reported the wurtzite (hexagonal) phase of ZnS. This suggests that temperature can play a role in stabilizing different crystal structures of the product metal sulfide, which in turn can influence the overall sulfidation kinetics.
Co-precipitated mixed oxides showed smaller particle sizes, higher specific surface areas, and a higher H2S capacity compared to their impregnated counterparts that are synthesized by immersing the parent oxide in a salt solution of the dopant metal and calcining this precursor at 350 C. (131) These authors also studied adsorption on single-phase CoZnAlO prepared from co-precipitated hydroxycarbonate precursors (hydrotalcite-type structure). (151) The presence of aluminum increased the specific surface areas, but the modified compounds did not adsorb significantly more H2S per metallic (Zn, Co) species. H2S adsorption in CoZn oxides with varying Co/Zn atomic ratios showed that the increase in % utilization correlates well with the increase in surface area; the main function of Co doping seems to be increasing the surface area by reducing the particle size. (132) Thermodynamically, Co3O4 has a more negative free energy for sulfidation than ZnO. Additionally, sulfiding cubic Co3O4 normal spinel to spinel Co3S4 or Co8S9 will require lesser lattice rearrangement than that for hexagonal ZnO to cubic ZnS.
Westmoreland et al. showed that the intrinsic reaction rate of H2S with MnO over a temperature range of 300800 C is approximately 1 order of magnitude greater than that with ZnO, even though its surface area was an order of magnitude smaller. (154) Higher conversions were observed for mixed oxides of Zn containing Fe, Ni, Co, Mn, Cu, Al, Ti, and Zr at room temperature, especially for Zn2.9MnO4.2, but the reason for poor conversion for pure Mn3O4 solid is not yet clear. (117) Regeneration of ZnTi-based mixed metal oxides using 20% O2 in He at 750 C for 4 h showed broad XRD peaks of very low intensity, indicating transformation to an amorphous material. (152) Doping this oxide with Mn, Cu, or Mo led to an improvement in H2S uptake for the regenerated solid: 41 mg/g for 10Mn45Zn45TiO using a feed of 600 ppm H2S, 25% H2, and 7.5% CO2 in helium. The presence of 1% H2O in the feed leads to a significantly higher capacity (160 mg/g). Davidson et al. have demonstrated the autocatalytic role of water during desulfurization on ZnO, suggesting a mechanism involving proton transfer from H2S to chemisorbed OH groups from hydration of the surface. (137, 155) Addition of Fe showed a pronounced effect of Fe/Mn molar ratio on the morphology of the FeMnZnTi mixed oxide crystallites. (116) H2S uptakes of 82 mg/g and 17 mg/g were observed for 5Fe15Mn40Zn40TiO and 20Fe40Zn40TiO, respectively; in this case, 1% H2O led to only a small increase in capacity to 100 mg/g. Mssbauer spectroscopy is sensitive to changes in the energy levels of an atomic nucleus in response to its environment; quadrupole splitting (Δ) is induced by an electric field gradient of nearby electrons. Changes in Δ during sulfidation and regeneration in the case of 5Fe15Mn40Zn40TiO solid, compared to no changes for 20Fe40Zn40TiO solid, suggest that Mn makes the mixed oxide structures more susceptible to structural distortions, in turn enhancing H2S adsorption. Regeneration in 20% O2 in He at 500 C for 4 h resulted in over 80% of capacity recovered for the Fe-containing solids, while regeneration at 750 C halved the H2S capacity. The structure was preserved for the regenerated 5Fe15Mn40Zn40TiO solid with clear peaks in the XRD pattern.
Liu et al. investigated copper-based cp-mixed oxides (see Table 7) and observed high capacities for Fe-doped oxides. (157) Capacities were 1040% higher for H2S in bulk N2 compared to the case of bulk CO2, suggesting some degree of competitive adsorption with CO2; the inhibition effect was lower for doped CuO compared to pure CuO. The authors report that regenerated CuO exhibited a breakthrough capacity up to 75% of its initial value when regenerated between 100 and 200 C but decreased rapidly with further increase of regeneration temperature. The authors explain that CuS tends to decompose into the more stable Cu2S when the temperature is above 220 C. The authors carried out five adsorptionregeneration cycles for pure CuO, CuAlO, and FeCuAlO with regeneration using air at 100 C. For CuO, the regenerated capacities were maintained at 75% of the fresh adsorbent capacity; however, regenerated capacities decreased for the CuAlO and FeCuAlO adsorbents and became steady during the last two cycles at 50% and 43% of the fresh capacity, respectively. These studies bring to light the difficulty in regenerating the high capacities of mixed metal oxides; future work in this area should focus not only on high-capacity sorbents but also on better regenerability.

Researchers have investigated H2S adsorption in three-dimensionally ordered macroporous (3DOM) structures of iron oxide (3DOM-F) and of silica-supported iron oxide (3DOM-FS) prepared by a colloidal crystal templating method (see Table 8). (158, 159) Highly uniform polystyrene (PS) beads ordered into close-packed domains were used as a template for the growth of the inorganic 3DOM structure; the resulting pore diameters were considerably smaller than the original PS sphere. (158) The shrinkage in size resulting from sintering during calcination ranged from 45 to 59% for the 3DOM-F sorbents and from 37 to 45% for the 3DOM-FS sorbents. 3DOM-FS showed somewhat smaller nanoparticles (5 nm) than 3DOM-F (25 nm), which the authors explain as silicon keeping the iron grains separate and preventing the latter from growing larger during calcination. Depending on the macropore diameter, these structures have variable surface areas, ranging from 16 to 44 m2/g for 3DOM-F and from 80 to 220 m2/g for 3DOM-FS. Mesopore-sized void spaces between the crystallites are observed in the TEM images and also from the pore size distribution (2033 and 617 nm for 3DOM-F and 3DOM-FS, respectively) obtained from the N2 isotherms. It can be seen that the % utilization of Fe improves with increase in macropore diameter up to about 150 nm due to possible reduction in diffusion limitations, but further increasing the macropore diameter leads to a lowering of Fe utilization. Nearly complete regeneration of 3DOM-FS samples using 2% O2 in N2 at 300 C was shown for three cycles. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) illustrated that, despite some cracking, the macroporosity and ordering of the structure was still intact and the overall 3DOM structure was retained after second regeneration.

Huang et al. studied the effect of Fe:Si ratio from 1 to 16 (and also the case of no Si), temperature, and humidity on the low-temperature desulfurization performance of 3DOM structures. (159) Breakthrough capacities showed an increase with increase in Fe:Si ratio up to 8; low capacity at even higher Fe:Si ratios was attributed to the presence of α-Fe2O3. SiO2 enhanced the dispersion of Fe2O3, which stabilized the γ-Fe2O3 and hindered its transformation to α-Fe2O3 during calcination. The authors further explain that the vacancy site in the lattice of γ-Fe2O3, accompanied by its lower density, larger surface area, and smaller grain size, facilitates ion diffusion. Relative humidity of 10% favored H2S removal. It was also found that conventional regeneration at 300 C using 5% O2 in N2 resulted in a drastic loss of capacity for the regenerated material. As an alternative regeneration technique, the authors proposed an in situ regeneration process by adding 5% O2 to the feed stream (desulfurization and regeneration occur at the same time); this resulted in breakthrough capacities twice those observed when O2 was absent from the inlet gas. In the case of conventional regeneration, a significant fraction of γ-Fe2O3 transformed to α-Fe2O3, while no such change was observed for the case where O2 was added to the feed. It is unclear if this simultaneous desulfurizationregeneration process is resulting in a transformation of H2S to SO2; monitoring only H2S concentration in the outlet stream may hint at high H2S breakthrough capacity, but monitoring SO2 concentration may reveal that little or no sulfur is adsorbed in such a process.
In another study, Wang et al. synthesized 3DOM structures of ZnO and silica, with different weight percent of ZnO ranging from 23 to 70%. (160) Samples exhibited a typical amorphous structure, except 3DOM-SZ73, which showed peaks corresponding to ZnO in the XRD pattern. Highest utilization of 69% was observed for the 3DOM structure with 50 wt% ZnO; nearly 70% of this capacity was retained for four regeneration cycles (air at 500 C for 4 h). These adsorbents hold significant promise for desulfurization at ambient temperature, and investigation of structural stability over several regeneration cycles will help reveal the true potential of these sorbents for commercial application.
Even though cobalt oxide is one of the thermodynamically more favorable metals for desulfurization of H2S, attempts at making it a major component for removing H2S are limited. (132, 162) Due to larger particle sizes, bulk cobalt oxide showed slower sulfidation and incomplete conversion even at 500 C, but when it was supported on either Al2O3 or TiO2, higher rates and complete conversion could be observed even at 300 C, primarily due to smaller grain size. (162) TiO2-supported Co3O4 showed lower activation barriers, and it may serve as an effective H2S removal sorbent, even at lower temperatures. Pahalagedara et al. investigated mesoporous cobalt oxides (m-Co-X, where X = 150, 250, 350, or 450 C, the calcination temperature) as desulfurization sorbents and could achieve 100% capacity at 150 C. (161) The reason for breakthrough capacities higher than 100% metal utilization for mesoporous Co and Mn is not clear but may be attributed to physically adsorbed H2S beyond the chemically reacted capacity. The authors also investigated other mesoporous materials (Cr2O3, CuO, Mn2O3, and Fe2O3) that showed superior activities compared to their nonporous analogues (as high as 200 times). Using field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM), the mesostructure was shown to be preserved after sulfidation, but the mesostructure collapsed during calcination at 450 C, and regeneration at 400 C in air resulted in a 45% drop in capacity. An alternative regeneration technique for ZnO catalysts using a 3:1 H2O/N2 mixture at 800 C resulted in nearly 100% capacity regeneration without loss of porosity, as opposed to only about 10% regeneration and significant increase in bulk density of the adsorbent when air was used at the same temperature. (163) A significant scope still remains for developing better regeneration procedures for metal oxides that retain not only the adsorption capacity reversibility but also the structural reversibility. The latter is more important from the perspective of adsorbent bed stability to prevent attrition of the solids that will increase the pressure drop across the bed.
3.2 Metals
Early literature focused on H2S poisoning of metal catalysts and the threshold concentration below which H2S will not unduly poison a given metal catalyst. McCarty and Wise investigated the thermodynamics of H2S chemisorption on different metallic catalysts over a wide range of temperatures and reported the order of increasing activity toward H2S at 300 C and 50% surface coverage to be Ni > Co > Ru > Fe > Pt. (164-167) Using magnetization measurements, Den Besten and Selwood showed that H2S is dissociatively chemisorbed on the Ni surface. (168) The enthalpy of adsorption of H2S on Ni was measured to be about 130160 kJ/mol. (164, 169) Due to such high enthalpies of adsorption, adsorbent regeneration will result in a very expensive natural gas desulfurization process. Metal adsorbents may be useful as a final polishing step to limit the energy duty for H2S adsorption/regeneration. For example, they can be useful in certain applications such as direct-methane fuel cells (170) to achieve ultra-low sulfur content methane from pre-treated natural gas.
Usually, when metals are employed for H2S removal, they are used as sacrificial sorbents since, during a regeneration process, metals will have a strong tendency to sinter and aggregate, resulting in a complete loss of surface area and active sites. By isolating and stabilizing small metal particles in cubic structured mesoporous silica, Li et al. were probably the first to demonstrate the regeneration of the sulfur-loaded adsorbents with minimal sintering (see Figure 5). (171) Adsorption was carried out at 300 C using a coal syngas composition of 23% H2, 29% CO, 8% CO2, 30% H2O, 10% He, and 10 ppm H2S, and regeneration was carried out at 550 C using a five-cycle alternating oxidationreduction treatment of pure H2 and 10% air in Ar with a short Ar purge in between. A fully regenerable capacity of 7 mg of S/g adsorbent over five adsorptionregeneration cycles was achieved for 16.6 wt% Ni loaded on SBA-16, with the ratio of chemisorbed H2S to Ni being 0.07. It is unclear, however, whether H2S adsorption was carried out on the hydrogen-regenerated form of the adsorbent or on the air-regenerated form that would result in a metal oxide.

3.3 MetalOrganic Frameworks
MOFs are porous structures resulting from coordination of metal ions or clusters to organic ligands. (172) Bare metals exist at most as nanoparticles formed out of clusters of several thousands of atoms and suffer from activity loss by way of sintering during high-temperature regeneration. MOFs provide a scheme for isolating the metal atoms or the metal oxide clusters by being chemically coordinated within a porous framework. This allows design of adsorbents where not only each metal atom exclusively interacts with a single adsorbate molecule but also each of these interaction sites may be regenerated without significant loss of activity. Additionally, appropriately functionalized organic ligands can also contribute in promoting the selectivity toward the desired gas molecule. MOFs offer a large parameter space to rationally design the size, shape, and functionality of pores with high adsorption and/or diffusion selectivity toward the molecule of interest. In addition to selectivity, performance and structural reversibility on regeneration are important factors in judging the performance. The presence of polar impurities such as H2O on the adsorption performance as well as stability of the adsorbent structure can also play determining roles in the successful application of MOFs for desulfurization applications. Typical pore diameters in MOFs are in the microporous regime ranging from 3 to 20 Å, (173) although more recently, MOFs with pore sizes as high as 85 Å have been synthesized for inclusion of large biological molecules. (174) Due to the highly porous nature of most MOFs, their lower conductivity (0.3 W/m·K for MOF-5 at 300 K (175)) compared to that of crystalline materials in general can be a potential concern for strong hostguest interactions. Desulfurization using MOFs has been reviewed in the past; (14, 15, 176, 177) here we try to summarize some of these topics, provide our interpretation, and identify areas for further investigation.
Hamon et al. carried out the first experimental study of H2S adsorption in MOFs; these included the small-pore (SP) MIL-53(AlIII, CrIII, FeIII) and MIL-47(VIV) (11 Å) and the large-pore (LP) MIL-100(Cr) and MIL-101(Cr) (25 and 30 Å cage diameter and 4.8×5.8 and 12.5×12.5 Å pore apertures, respectively). (178) SP MILs are built from corner-sharing chains of metal oxide (MIVO6) or hydroxide (MIIIO4(OH)2) octahedra connected through terephthalate moieties (SBET  1000 m2/g) (see Figure 6). LP MILs comprise of trimers of chromium octahedra linked with trimesate (MIL-100) or terephthalate (MIL-101) (SBET > 2000 m2/g). MIL-100, MIL-101, and MIL-47 showed the type-I-shaped (no adsorption step) isotherm, indicating that these are rigid structures; MIL-53(Al,Cr,Fe) exhibited two-step adsorption isotherms, which the authors proposed to be caused by the polar H2S molecules interacting strongly with the OH groups of the inorganic chains at the pore opening, leading to closure of the pores at low loading. This hypothesis was later claimed to be verified using infrared (IR) spectroscopy and molecular simulations. (179) It should be noted here that, for the breathing MOF (MIL-53(Cr)), isotherms were simulated for two different rigid MOF structures, representing the narrow and the large-pore regimes in the experimental adsorption isotherm. By imposing the experimental fractions of each pore type as a function of pressure, a composite isotherm was calculated for the simulated isotherms. While this strategy yields a good match with the experimental data, the study did not investigate the ability to predict the structural transformation. Measurement of excess CH4 adsorption before and after high-pressure H2S adsorption followed by vacuum desorption showed full recovery of CH4 capacity for MIL-47(V) and MIL-53(Al,Cr), partial recovery for MIL-100 and MIL-101, and complete loss of capacity for MIL-53(Fe) due to its decomposition into iron sulfide. At 30 C and 20 bar, MIL-101 showed an unprecedented H2S loading of 38.4 mmol/g; MIL-53(Al,Cr), MIL-47, and MIL-100 showed saturation loadings of 11.8, 13.1, 14.6, and 16.7 mmol/g, respectively, which are also quite high compared to those of other H2S adsorbents. However, in cases such as off-shore natural gas sweetening, where having a smaller footprint is important, volumetrically bulky porous MOFs suffer a drawback. Adsorption being an exothermic process, sharp increases in temperatures for MOFs with ultra-high capacity raise concerns about bed stability in the absence of adequate heat transfer. Attempts to compute thermal conductivities of MOFs in the presence of adsorbed gases are starting to elucidate that the thermal conductivity of MOFs decreases with increasing pore sizes. (180, 181)

Vaesen et al. explored functionalization of MOFs for desulfurization application by comparing amino-functionalized titanium terephthalate MIL-125(Ti)-NH2 versus its parent MIL-125(Ti) analogue. (182) The frameworks consists of tetrahedral (4.7 Å) and octahedral (10.7 Å) cages, accessible through triangular windows of 57 Å. The cage diameters for the functionalized material are slightly smaller those of the parent material (6 and 12 Å for the tetrahedral and octahedral cages, respectively). Grand Canonical Monte Carlo (GCMC) simulations were carried out using force fields that were shown to yield a decent agreement with the single-component experimental adsorption isotherms and enthalpies. The GCMC-predicted binary H2S/CH4 selectivity values (at 10 bar, 30 C, and yH2S = 0.001) for MIL-125(Ti) and MIL-125(Ti)-NH2 were reported to be 40 and 67, respectively. The H2S adsorption enthalpy for these materials (30 kJ/mol) is comparable to that for the aluminosilicate zeolite 4A (35 kJ/mol). (183) These MOF materials are thermally stable up to 300 C, but only up to 100 C in water vapor. Their performance and structural stability in the presence of both H2S and H2O require further investigation. Furthermore, the moderately high CO2/CH4 selectivity (7) allows for envisaging a one-step process for the concomitant elimination of CO2 and H2S. Obtaining separate CO2-rich and H2S-rich streams unnecessarily increases the separation costs if the end goal for H2S is high-pressure reinjection into empty wells, instead of the conventional Claus process for sulfur recovery.
Yang et al. studied H2S adsorption in MIL-68(Al) at room temperature using molecular simulations and experiments. (184) This framework consists of two kinds of channels, triangular (6.06.4 Å) and hexagonal (1617 Å), running along the c axis (see Figure 7). It was found that only some of the hydroxyls were available for interaction, as evidenced by the computed isotherm, obtained by blocking the triangular channels, matching exactly with the experimental isotherm. It can also be observed that the saturation loadings are less sensitive to the choice of force field parameters than the Henrys law region slope. This partially activated material was fully regenerable for five consecutive cycles with a pure-component H2S capacity of 12 mmol/g at 30 C and 12 bar and an adsorption enthalpy of 21 kJ/mol. Even if the material can be fully activated, the 25% additional saturation capacity, that is predicted from simulations, may or may not be accessible; the difference in the adsorbed amounts of CH4 and CO2 for the material activated at 260 or 330 C was negligible. Although MIL-68(Al) is a polymorph of MIL-53(Al) (described above), unlike the latter, the former does not seem to exhibit framework flexibility, as evidenced by its type-I adsorption isotherm. This brings to light the importance of MOF framework topology in addition to the choice of the metallic cluster and the organic ligands, further iterating the importance of powerful screening of adsorbents using existing and new computational techniques that capture these subtle differences.

Cu-BTC (or HKUST-1 or MOF-199) comprises of an intersecting three-dimensional system of large square-shaped pores (9 × 9 Å) and small tetrahedral pockets (5 Å) formed with copper as the inorganic metal and benzene-1,3,5-tricarboxylic acid (BTC), also known as trimesic acid, as the organic linker (see Figure 8) with a reasonable degree of thermal stability (up to 240 C). (185) In the past few years, several research groups have investigated various aspects of H2S adsorption in this material. (186-192) Petit et al. first studied HKUST-1 and its composites with graphite oxide under ambient conditions using 1000 ppm H2S in moist air. (186) The authors commented that bed pre-humidification does not prevent the adsorption of H2S (2.7 mmol/g); on the contrary, it favors its retention via dissolution in the water film. Additional H2S measurements in absence of moisture will help better understand the role of H2O. The XRD pattern revealed that exposure to H2S results in a collapse of the MOF structure. From the decrease in pH on H2S adsorption and from Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, it was concluded that the BTC ligands were released (no more coordinated to copper) to their acidic form.

Watanabe and Sholl investigated chemisorption of several molecules, including H2S and H2O, in Cu-BTC using plane wave periodic DFT. (187) H2O and H2S showed similar binding energies of 51 and 47 kJ/mol, respectively. Single-component GCMC adsorption simulations at room temperature, computed by restricting the chemisorbed molecules in the geometries obtained from prior DFT calculations, showed that the onset pressure for H2O adsorption is nearly 3 orders of magnitude lower than that for H2S. The influence of physisorbed molecules on the adsorption isotherm was not considered in this study. H2S models in the literature, trained to reproduce the bulk liquid densities and vapor pressures, significantly over-estimate the gas-phase dipole moment of H2S. Gutirrez-Sevillano et al. developed new H2S models to test whether a model with an accurate gas-phase dipole moment could predict a strong interaction of H2S with Cu-BTC, in line with the experimental observation. (188) The simulations used generic force fields for the MOF structure that have been shown to perform reasonably well for some of the other adsorption studies in MOFs. (184) Additionally, their hybrid DFT calculations showed that indeed H2O has a higher affinity for the copper sites (extra 3.3 kJ/mol) compared to H2S. Ab initio molecular dynamics (MD) studies of the molecules adsorbed on the model cluster showed H2O to be closer to the copper center compared to H2S by about 2.6 Å. Another hybrid DFT study, with a damped 1/r6 term to account for London dispersion, showed that the interaction energies for H2O and H2S adsorption on Cu-BTC are 60.9 and 52.2 kJ/mol, respectively, reiterating the dominance of H2O. (189) Different theoretical treatments are in agreement that the interaction of Cu-BTC with H2S is weaker than that with H2O, thus failing to explain the experimental observation that H2S converts Cu in Cu-BTC to black CuS in the presence of moisture. (186) An important point to note here is that the theoretical studies only considered the hostguest interaction; however, H2S reacts chemically with copper to form CuS, and the thermodynamics of product formation have not been attempted in any of the theoretical studies reported so far.
Li et al. experimentally investigated the same system by activating the material before carrying out H2S adsorption. (190) They found that the breakthrough capacity increased by 38% on activation at 180 C compared to the unactivated sample and decreased by 10% if the sample was activated further at 200 C. The breakthrough capacity also increased by 40% when the adsorption temperature was raised from 30 to 80 C. Both of these observations suggest that there is a competitive adsorption between H2O and H2S, and lowering the adsorbed quantity of moisture, either with an increased activation temperature or with an increased adsorption temperature, increases the H2S capacity. Contrary to this inference, Peterson et al. observed no change in H2S adsorption capacity under dry (0% relative humidity) and wet (80% relative humidity) conditions. (191) In spite of a lot of research effort to understand the role of moisture in desulfurization using Cu-BTC, this problem remains unresolved.
Eddaoudi et al. synthesized a series of 16 isoretucular (having the same network topology) MOFs (IRMOF-n, n = 116) based on a skeleton of Zn-based MOF-5, wherein the pore functionality and size were varied without changing the original cubic topology. (173) Theoretical investigation of H2S was performed in IRMOF-1 (or MOF-5) having 1,4-benzenedicarboxylate organic linkers; the heat of adsorption was 15 kJ/mol, much lower than that for Cu-BTC (30 kJ/mol) due to wider (11.2 Å) pores of IRMOF-1 compared to confined (5 Å) tetrahedral-shaped pockets in Cu-BTC. IRMOF-1 also results in 6 kJ/mol weaker binding than H2O, suggesting the difficulty in using this material for H2S adsorption from moist natural gas. (188) Wang et al. studied IRMOF-3 (free pore diameter of 9.6 Å) having 2-amino-1,4-benzenedicarboxylate ligands and showed that the breakthrough capacity increased by 46% on activation at 150 C compared to that of the unactivated sample and decreased by 93% if the sample was activated further at 200 C. (193) The breakthrough capacity decreased to 19% when the adsorption temperature was increased from 30 to 60 C. It would be interesting to study comparative H2S adsorption in the two MOFs (IRMOF-1 and IRMOF-3) to understand the role of the NH2 group in IRMOF-3 for selective binding with acid gases.
Allan et al. studied desulfurization using Ni-CPO-27 and Zn-CPO-27, where Ni/Zn cations are linked by 2,5-dihydroxyterephthalic acid organic linkers, forming a honeycomb lattice with channels of 11 Å pore diameter. (194) In the hydrated state, each metal is coordinated by one H2O molecule, but upon activation at 150 C under vacuum, H2O is removed, leaving the metal in square pyramidal geometry with an open metal site, resulting in SBET = 1193 and 379 m2/g, respectively. H2S exposure did not degrade the crystalline structure of Ni-CPO-27 but amorphized Zn-CPO-27. (194, 195) Ni-CPO-27 showed a steep rise in loading up to 6.4 mmol/g (corresponding to each metal center interacting with one gas molecule, see Figure 9), indicating a sharp chemisorption regime followed by a slower uptake likely due to physisorption up to 12 mmol/g at atmospheric pressure. Adsorbents with such high loadings at low pressures are rare, and it may be useful in effectively removing large amounts of H2S from gas streams with a low H2S partial pressure. However, the material cannot be fully regenerated at outgassing temperature of 150 C and a vacuum of 0.1 Pa, (194) but it could be nearly completely regenerated at 200 C. (195) The authors hint at some damage to the framework by this high-temperature regeneration; additional microscopy and diffraction data for the regenerated samples should help understand the degree of damage and whether the structural damage increases with the number of regeneration cycles. The heat of adsorption is nearly constant (5658 kJ/mol) up to a loading of 0.7 H2S molecule per atom of Ni, assuming all Ni atoms are activated. The authors comment that, beyond this loading, the drop in interaction strength can be justified with typical weak physisorption with no specific interaction between the host/guest species. However, it is unclear how the physisorption regime can start without reaching a loading of 1 H2S molecule per Ni atom, and this could possibly indicate incomplete activation of the MOF (70% activated). Compared to other MOFs investigated so far for H2S adsorption, Ni-CPO-27 shows the highest uptake and high enthalpy of adsorption (indicative of possibly higher selectivity over methane) with structural stability. However, the experimental heat of adsorption of H2O for this material is <100 kJ/mol, which may or may not make this material an ideal adsorbent for natural gas in the presence of moisture. Nonetheless, the material appears to be very promising and should be investigated for H2S adsorption in the presence of H2O.

Using GCMC simulations with generic force fields that have not been thoroughly validated for any particular property, Peng and Cao carried out a screening of some select porous carbons, zeolites, and MOFs for a feed containing 0.2% H2S, 29.8% CO2, and 70% CH4 at 50 bar and 30 C. (196) Among the MOFs, indium-based rho-zMOF (a zeolite-like MOF with the topology of rho-zeolite) and socMOF showed high selectivity (175 and 100, respectively) and capacity (2.6 and 1.8 mmol/g, respectively). The capacity for rho-zMOF at temperatures of 60 C and higher is reported to be 0.5 mmol/g, suggesting a working capacity of about 2 mmol/g with very low temperatures of regeneration. While this is an important discovery, there is a considerable uncertainty in the force-field parameters for such highly charged systems, and experiments will help to confirm the validity of the predictions as regards such high selectivity and capacity as well as stability of MOF in the presence of impurities such as moisture.
Very recently, Belmabkhout et al. investigated In3+-, Fe3+-, Ga3+-, and Al3+-based socMOFs as adsorbents and thin-film membranes for the production of high-quality hydrocarbons (CH4, C3H8 and n-C4H10, and olefins) from H2S-containing gas streams. Only Ga3+- and Al3+-based socMOFs could preserve the crystal structure on exposure to H2S. (197) The authors measured pure-component adsorption isotherms for H2S, CO2, and CH4 in Ga3+-socMOF at 25 C and found that, unlike CH4 and CO2, H2S showed a steep adsorption. The authors also carried out breakthrough measurements for a ternary mixture containing 5% H2S, 5% CO2, and 90% CH4 for six adsorptiondesorption cycles with a combination of temperature and vacuum swing regeneration. Optimal regeneration was achieved at 160 C under a helium flow for 8 h with complete recyclability of the adsorbent. Since the mass of adsorbent used for the experiment is unclear (between 0.1 and 0.4 g), the reported H2S breakthrough time of 40 min translates to a breakthrough capacity between 2 and 8 mmol/g. CH4 and CO2 breakthrough occurred at nearly 0 and 5 min, respectively, suggesting very high H2S/CH4 and H2S/CO2 selectivities. The narrow window aperture (4.5 Å) to reach the cages of the of Ga3+-socMOF may have an influence on the breakthrough capacity and selectivity. Al3+-socMOF was shown to be stable up to temperatures as high as 300 C and relative humidity as high as 95%, and even soaking in liquid water for 2 weeks did not affect the XRD pattern. However, the H2O stability of the Ga3+-socMOF was not reported. These materials show promise for regenerative sour gas sweetening using MOFs.
Stability of adsorbent in the corrosive environment of acid gases in the presence/absence of moisture is arguably the most important test that the adsorbent must meet in order to qualify as a potential candidate for sweetening applications. The not-so-strong coordination bond between the metal and the organic ligand in a MOF structure make it very susceptible to hydrolysis and poor stability. Burtch et al. have recently published a very detailed paper in Chemical Reviews on the hydrothermal stability of MOFs. (198) Apart from a few studies on acid gas stability of certain MOFs, (199) this area is not very mature for a comprehensive review. Future efforts in this direction will not only help advance the development of adsorbents for commercial purposes but also enhance the fundamental understanding of MOF stability.
Zeolitic imidazolate frameworks (ZIFs), a sub-class of MOFs, composed of transition metal ions that replace the silicon/aluminum atoms in a zeolite topology and organic linkers in place of the oxygen atoms in the zeolite lattice, are a relatively new type of materials that benefit from the structural variety of MOFs and stability of zeolites. (200, 201) ZIF-8, with a BET surface area of 1630 m2/g, a high thermal stability (up to 550 C), and remarkable chemical resistance to boiling alkaline water and organic solvents, (201) is one of the very extensively studied ZIF materials in the literature. Recently, Ethiraj et al. investigated the stability of HKUST-1 and ZIF-8 MOFs in an H2S environment using various techniques, including XRD, and observed a significantly higher stability of ZIF-8 over HKUST-1. (192) Other microporous materials, such as covalent organic frameworks (202) and porous aromatic frameworks, (203) that are low-density, high-surface-area materials but do not contain any selective metallic sites, can be explored for bulk H2S removal.
As noted earlier, feed streams with varying overall pressure as well as concentration of H2S are likely to require very different sweetening procedures. While low-concentration (101000 ppm) breakthrough measurements provide important data for applications such as Claus tail gas cleanup, data at higher H2S partial pressures are also important for applications involving ultra-sour gas streams. A major difficulty in drawing a fair comparison between different MOFs in the literature for H2S adsorption arises due to the unavailability of complete adsorption data over a wide range of partial pressures, from a few ppm at atmospheric pressure to 100% H2S at several atmospheres in the presence/absence of moisture, different definitions of breakthrough capacity, etc. Future studies should account for factors such as moisture, regeneration for several cycles, and XRD measurements before and after each (or at least, after every few) regeneration.
3.4 Zeolites
For several decades, zeolites have been used as catalysts in the petrochemical industry for cracking, isomerization, and alkylation applications. These materials are also widely used for water purification and softening in the detergent industry. Structurally, zeolites are crystalline porous aluminosilicates consisting of a three-dimensional framework of SiO4 and AlO4 tetrahedra. Their pores are defined by their crystal structure and have precise sizes and shapes, allowing them excellent sieving properties at a molecular level. As of today, the database of the International Zeolite AssociationStructure Commission identifies 232 unique zeolite frameworks, and each framework is represented by a three-letter code. (204) The International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry classifies nanoporous materials into three classes: microporous (<2 nm), mesoporous (250 nm), and macroporous (>50 nm). Zeolites are microporous in nature, and depending on the particular framework structure, the maximum diameter of a sphere that can diffuse through the zeolite framework can range from 1 to 8 Å. The maximum diameter of a sphere that can be included in the zeolite structures can range from 3 to 16 Å.
3.4.1 All-Silica Zeolites
All-silica zeolites have a very low polarity due to negligible amounts of polar cations and silanol defects, imparting a highly hydrophobic character to this class of zeolites. (206) Maghsoudi et al. first investigated pure-component adsorption of H2S and CH4 in an all-silica zeolite of the chabazite (CHA) framework. (207) This material demonstrated a high H2S capacity of 4 mmol/g at 25 C and 2 bar, suggesting that all-silica zeolites maybe promising materials for bulk H2S removal. Shah et al. carried out Monte Carlo simulations of H2S and CH4, both pure-component and mixture, over a wide range of temperatures, pressures, and compositions in seven different all-silica zeolites. (208) The authors showed quantitative agreement between predictive molecular simulations without any fitting parameters and the experimental data reported by Maghsoudi et al., thus validating the force fields for H2S, (209) CH4, (210) and the zeolite. (211) Shat et al. also assessed the application of ideal adsorbed solution theory (IAST) to pure-component data in order to predict mixture data and found differences as high as 60% in case of some zeolites. In order to probe whether the presence of H2S induces H2O coadsorption and reduces the hydrophobic character of all-silica zeolites, binary H2S/H2O mixture adsorption in MFI was also studied. The simulations showed preferential adsorption of H2S over H2O with a selectivity of about 18, suggesting that these zeolites can be promising materials for sour gas sweetening. In a subsequent study, Shat et al. carried out a large-scale computational screening of the adsorption of binary H2S/CH4 and H2S/C2H6 mixtures in the all-silica forms of 386 zeolitic frameworks (see Figure 10). (205) The authors also investigated the adsorption of four- and five-component mixtures at the conditions representing sour gas fields for 16 promising all-silica zeolites selected from binary adsorption selectivities and capacities. It was found that, depending on the fractions of CH4, C2H6, and CO2, different sorbents allow for optimal H2S removal and hydrocarbon recovery.

Liu et al. carried out a multi-scale modeling study for combined material screening and process optimization to reduce the overall process cost with atomistic and mesoscopic scales for the selection of zeolites and the macroscopic scale for the selection of optimal conditions for pressure swing adsorption. (212) Several high-performing zeolites were identified, and zeolite ABW ranks as one of the top materials for the removal of both H2S and CO2 (acid gases) from natural gas. There is a considerable degree of overlap between the zeolites identified from the two screening studies in the literature for high H2S/CH4 selectivities. (205, 212) The best-performing zeolites will likely always be from this pool of structures identified with high selectivity over methane; however, the optimal adsorbent will depend on the feed conditions (wet/dry, lean/rich in light hydrocarbons, CO2/H2S proportions).
Of all the top-performing structures presented in Figure 10, CAS, DOH, ITE, ITH, ITW, MEL, MEP, MFI, MTN, RRO, RWR, and SFF frameworks have been synthesized in their all-silica form, IWV with a Si/Al ratio of 29, SEW with a Si/B ratio of 13, and ABW, BIK, EDI, EPI, GIS, JBW, LTJ, LTL, MER, MON, MOZ, PAU, PHI, and UFI with a low to moderate Si/Al ratio. (205) Although DOH, MEP, and MTN show a high selectivity, it is unlikely that the pores in these structures with only six-membered ring openings will allow accessibility to the selective sites. Development of experimental syntheses for the all-silica defect-free forms of these top-performing zeolite topologies can further the development of these hydrophobic adsorbents for the bulk acid gas removal from ultra-sour gas fields.
3.4.2 Aluminosilicate Zeolites
Aluminosilicate zeolites are crystalline microporous frameworks, based on a three-dimensional network of silica and alumina, that can accommodate a variety of cations such as Na+, K+, Ca2+, etc. In addition to the precise sizes and shapes of pores in all-silica zeolites that allow them excellent sieving properties at a molecular level, the cations in aluminosilicate zeolites may allow the possibility of strong selective interactions with the desired polar gas molecules. There is a significant amount of literature exploring the Claus reaction between H2S and SO2 to produce elemental sulfur using cation-exchanged zeolites. (213, 214) While this is a very important aspect of sour gas sweetening, it has been reviewed in the past, (20) and we will focus here on the interaction of these zeolites with H2S in the absence of oxygen.
Ozekmekci et al. have presented a short review on H2S removal using zeolites. (215) We try to expand on this subject here. Identifying the adsorption mechanism of H2S in cation-exchanged zeolites has been a challenge, whether it is a physisorption, chemisorption by coordination to the cations, or a chemical reaction forming H2O using either framework oxygen or gas-phase oxygen impurities or possibly even metal oxides of the extra-framework cations. In an attempt to understand the adsorption mechanism, several zeolitic systems based on faujasite (FAU; NaX, NaY, HY), LTA (NaA, CaNaA, ZnNaA, MnNaA, CoNaA, NiNaA, CuNaA), and MFI (H-ZSM-5, Na-ZSM-5) were probed using IR, (216-221) UV/vis, (219) and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopies. (222)
On aluminum-rich FAU up to Si/Al ratios of about 2.5 (NaX zeolites), the first H2S molecules are adsorbed dissociatively, producing OH groups (3650 cm1) similar to those of hydrogen FAU; however, NaY-type zeolites with Si/Al > 2.5 adsorb the H2S molecules practically without dissociation. (218) Similar conclusions were also reported by Lechert and Henning using the NMR technique. (222) The first molecules adsorbed on NaX dissociated completely with formation of S2 and 2OH, but at higher coverages, dissociation into HS and H+ (see Figure 11) as well as physical adsorption occurs. (219) Four times higher H2S adsorption capacities for X-type zeolites than for Y-type zeolites were observed; moreover, the uptake changed in the following sequence: K-FAU > Na-FAU > Li-FAU, suggesting that H2S adsorption improves with FAU basicity. (223) Garcia and Lercher studied adsorption of H2S in ZSM-5 zeolites (Si/Al = 35.5) and observed molecular adsorption on both Na- and H-ZSM-5 zeolite surfaces. (221) In conclusion, lower Si/Al ratios promote dissociative adsorption of H2S on cation-exchanged zeolites. Recently, Sigot et al. attempted to investigate the retention mechanism of H2S on NaX zeolites with Si/Al ratio of 1.4. (224) The authors observed poor thermal desorption at 350 C, indicating no physisorption and the formation of stable sulfur polymers which further compromised thermal regeneration.
Figure 11
Figure 11. Schematic of dissociative H2S adsorption on an aluminosilicate zeolite.
The SH vibration band of H2S adsorbed on NaA showed a large frequency shift; however, in the case of CaNaA, over a wide range of coverage, the characteristic frequency of the SH band remained constant at 2540 cm1. (217) Thus, the authors concluded that no significant sorbatesorbate interactions occur and that all H2S molecules occupy equivalent sites in the case of CaNaA. No bands corresponding to adsorbed species were observed for NiNaA and CuNaA, and CoNaA adsorbed non-dissociatively, while ZnNaA and MnNaA demonstrated both dissociative and non-dissociative adsorption. (220) In agreement with previous studies of H2S adsorption on various zeolites, (216-218) water formation was observed on adsorption of H2S onto MnNaA, ZnNaA, and CoNaA. It is not very clear, however, whether H2O is formed using either framework oxygen or oxygen impurities in the gas feed. It is unclear if metal oxide clusters of the exchanged cations are present in the system and whether these form a source of oxygen for water formation. Very recently, Wynnyk and co-workers carried out precise and detailed measurements up to high pressures for adsorption of sour gas species (CO2, COS, CH4, and H2S) on zeolite 4A (LTA) with Si/Al ratios between 1.14 and 1.15 and activated under ultra-high vacuum (1010 bar) up to 400 C. (183) The adsorption isotherms of these compounds were found to be quite different, with saturation loadings extrapolated from the fitted adsorption isotherm for CH4, CO2, H2S, and COS being 9.16, 7.25, 5.87, and 3.11 mmol/g, respectively. The low saturation capacity of COS was not expected; computational calculations for HOMO bond orientation indicated that COS should be excluded from zeolite 4A, despite the experimental results. The reason for decreasing saturation loadings for CO2 with decreasing temperatures (0, 25, and 50 C) was not explained by the authors. The authors also calculated the enthalpy of adsorption using isotherms at different temperatures; at low loadings, CH4 and COS yield similar values of 20 kJ/mol, while CO2 and H2S interact more strongly, with values of 35 kJ/mol (near saturation loading). These enthalpies of adsorption seem too small to suggest a chemisorption behavior; however, it should be noted that these interactions can be sensitive to even trace amounts of H2O that may accompany the feed gas.
H2S adsorption on cluster models of metal-exchanged ZSM-12 (M = Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, and Zn atoms) was investigated using DFT calculations, and the reported enthalpies of adsorption were 77, 77, 90, 58, and 76 kJ/mol, respectively. (225) This suggests that Ni binds most strongly to H2S, while the binding with Cu is the weakest. One can see that the trends for different metals are not the same as reported for cation-exchanged LTA zeolites described above. (220) A key issue here is that we are not certain of the fraction of the cations in the ion-exchanged sites versus that in the metal oxide form. Several other factors, such as difference in the confinement of LTA and MTW zeolites for the same metallic species, presence of impurities in experimental measurements, or inadequate level of theory to describe the system using DFT, can also contribute to the different trends in the two zeolite types. In the absence of more data, it is hard to draw concrete conclusions about the affinity of various transition metal cations toward H2S.
SAPO-43, a small-pore silicoaluminophosphate, is a microporous sorbent with appropriate dimensions for sour gas sieving; however, its low thermal stability up to about 300 C prevents its utilization for adsorptive separations. Elemental analysis and CO2 heats of adsorption point to the presence of amine-like compounds entrapped in the surface of SAPO-43, which are believed to keep the framework from collapsing. (226) Hernndez-Maldonado et al. demonstrated the use of partially calcined SAPO-43 to separate CO2, H2S, and H2O from natural gas. (226) Regeneration with pure helium at 180 C was sufficient to remove almost all of the adsorbed water, but only 40% of the adsorption capacity was restored for H2S. The authors suggest that regeneration using chemicals such as hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) may help in entirely removing H2S without the need to thermally regenerate the adsorbent.
Crespo et al. compared the H2S breakthrough capacities among Cu(I)Y, Cu(II)Y, CuCl/MCM-41, CuCl/SBA-15, and AgY. (227) It was found from both ab initio molecular orbital calculations and the experimental temperature dependence of adsorption isotherms that the energy of adsorption decreased in the following order: Cu(I)Y > AgY > Cu(II)Y. The chemical composition of AgY zeolites, Ag63Al57Si135O384, clearly shows that the Ag/Al ratio is greater than unity; this suggests thats some of the cations are located at sites other than the cation-exchange sites. Structural characterization of cation-exchanged zeolites (228) may help in better understanding some of the anomalies in trends in affinity of H2S toward various cations. Nearly 70% regeneration of Cu(I)Y zeolite was achieved by heating at 450 C in a helium environment, and 100% regeneration could be accomplished by reacting with air at 350 C; this is another indication of cations in their oxide form. With a high H2S capacity at concentrations as low as 100 ppm, high selectivity over CH4, and being fully regenerable at a moderate temperature (350 C), Cu(I)Y, CuCl/SBA-15, and CuCl/MCM-41 materials hold some promise for natural gas desulfurization.
In addition to the H2S impurity, most natural gas fields also contain other impurities such as CO2, CO, and H2O, and these polar molecules may have a tendency to compete with, and sometime even supersede, H2S adsorption. Kumar et al. carried out a detailed investigation of such mixture systems for Na-, Ag-, and Cu-exchanged FAU at high and low Si/Al ratios (see Figure 12). (229) The authors report a nearly complete loss in H2S adsorption capacity for NaX zeolite in the presence of either CO2, CO, or H2O, while CuX and CuY showed similar losses in selectivity in the presence of CO. AgX and AgY zeolites maintained H2S capacities of about 3040 mg/g at 10 ppm H2S, even in the presence of all three impurities. The authors could also explain the observed experimental trends using DFT calculations; comparisons of the structures and energetics between the cluster and periodic calculations led to the conclusion that the confinement effect from the complete zeolitic framework is insignificant for the adsorbates studied. Further DFT calculations showed that, while the presence of the zeolite does not change radically the trend in the adsorption energies for alkali metal cations, in the case of transition metal cations it enhances the CO adsorption markedly relative to all other adsorbates. (230) The authors also investigated other cation-exchanged zeolites such as Zn(II)Y, Ni(II)Y, and Ga(III)Y and found that they are all subject to strong adsorption of H2O. (231) It should be noted here that strict ion exchange (without formation of metal oxides) has not been demonstrated for these cations.

In addition to the competitive adsorption in the presence of impurities, Blow and co-workers reported on reactive adsorption of H2S and CO2 on cation-exchanged LTA and FAU zeolites. (232-234) Due to strongly preferred sorption of H2O on these zeolites (H2O  H2S  CO2  COS), the equilibrium of the reaction H2S + CO2  COS + H2O is shifted to the right. As a result, one sulfur-containing species (H2S) is transformed to another (COS), with nearly zero enrichment of sulfur on the molecular sieve. The authors have extensively studied different variations of the adsorbent such as type of zeolite, Si/Al ratio, choice of cation for exchange, degree of ion exchange (percentage of Na+ exchanged), and presorption of NH3. At room temperature, H2S conversion on LTA can be as high as 50% for a Si/Al ratio of 1, and drops to nearly zero for a Si/Al ratio of 3. (232) At higher degrees of ion exchange, there is a considerable kinetic barrier, and one can observe H2S conversions anywhere between 20 and 75%, depending on the reaction time. (232, 233) Thus, in the absence of any known method to suppress this reaction, the authors suggest short-time techniques such as PSA/VSA. (234) This study suggests that future investigations of H2S breakthrough behavior in cationic zeolites should also monitor COS breakthrough.
3.4.3 Titanosilicates
In 1989, several synthetic titanosilicates were introduced as oxides or molecular sieves that have not only tetrahedrally coordinated sites that are characteristic of zeolites such as aluminosilicates or aluminophosphates but also octahedrally coordinated framework sites. (235) These materials possess moderately high surface areas (SBET  200 m2/g), and if active metals are well-dispersed on these supports, high metal utilization for reactive adsorption can be attained. Rezaei et al. have recently investigated low-temperature reactive H2S removal using copper-exchanged Engelhard titanosilicates (ETS-2, ETS-4, ETS-10). (236) While ETS-4 and ETS-10 are microporous, ETS-2 is most probably just a layered titanate and is too dense to be considered a molecular sieve. (235) Cu-ETS-2, Cu-ETS-4, and Cu-ETS-10 show H2S breakthrough capacities of 1.4, 0.32, and 1.3 mmol/g and copper utilization of 71, 44, and 98%, respectively. The high and low copper utilization in ETS-10 and ETS-4 has been attributed to their large and small pores, respectively, leading to pore blockage by adsorbed H2S in case of ETS-4. Since ETS-10 allows near complete utilization of copper sites at 8.4 wt% copper loading, higher loadings should be investigated to possibly improve breakthrough capacities. In a follow-up work, the authors investigated the effect of exchange metals such as Ag, Ca, Cu and Zn on ETS-2 and compared to a fully developed commercial H2S adsorbent (R3-11G, 36 wt% CuO, BASF). (237) The results indicated H2S uptake capacities in the following order: Cu-ETS-2 > Ag-ETS-2 > Zn-ETS-2  R3-11G > Ca-ETS-2  Na-ETS-2. In a recent study, Roller et al. studied Cu-ETS-2, Ce-ETS-2, and Cu-Ce-ETS-2 over a wide range of temperatures and under hydrogen-rich and water-rich atmospheres and found that, contrary to Ce-modified sorbents in the literature, (153) Ce-based ETS-2 showed a very low H2S breakthrough capacity. (238)
3.5 Carbon-Based Adsorbents
3.5.1 Activated Carbons
Activated carbon (AC) with surface areas easily in excess of 1000 m2/g due to a high degree of microporosity is a well-known material for adsorption and catalysis. It is most commonly manufactured by carbonizing easily available carbon sources such as coconut shell, wood, coal, etc. at high temperatures in an inert atmosphere. The resultant coke has pores too small for use as an adsorbent, and usually steam activation is carried out to enlarge the pore structure, making it accessible for adsorption. Several studies have been reported in the literature on the use of ACs for H2S adsorption as well as Claus reaction between H2S and O2 to form elemental sulfur. Unlike crystalline materials such as MOFs and zeolites, ACs are amorphous and hence characterized using N2 adsorption, pH measurements, thermal analysis, ion chromatography, elemental analysis, and FTIR techniques. It is nearly impossible to rationalize the large amounts of data in this field with various carbon sources, activation conditions, pH of adsorption, and presence of unidentifiable impurities in the ACs. An attempt is made to highlight some of the studies that show high adsorption of H2S, but the reasons for most of these are not well-understood.
Turk et al. have demonstrated the injection of basic chemicals such as ammonia and caustic solutions to enhance H2S adsorption. (239, 240) There are numerous investigations from the Bandosz group on removal of H2S using ACs that differ in their surface areas, pore volumes, and surface acidities. (241-246) The heat of H2S adsorption on a variety of ACs, differing in surface chemistry, pH, or the presence of specific oxygenated groups, was shown to be between 39 and 47 kJ/mol, about 2 times that obtained for a nonporous surface. (242) Adib et al. tried to increase the basicity of AC by impregnating it with urea; however, the H2S conversion decreased by about 10% from 298 to 272 mg/g for the impregnated samples compared to the initial sample, possibly due to an 18% decrease in surface area on urea impregnation. (244) Tian et al. chemically modified the surface of AC using 3-aminopropyltriethoxysilane (APTES), thus imparting a basic character to the sorbent with the goal of enhancing interaction with acidic H2S. (247) The authors observed poor breakthrough capacities of <1 mg/g at 1600 ppm, maybe due to blockage of pores because of the bulky APTES impregnation. At 8200 ppm the equilibrium adsorption capacity of H2S is 18.13, 8.88, and 6.03 mg/g for APTES-AC, Na2CO3-AC, and AC, respectively. Moisture and temperature were found to have adverse effects on H2S removal, while oxygen favored H2S removal. The negative role of humidity in this study is contradictory to previous studies of H2S adsorption on AC, (241) while the positive effect of oxygen has been explained by the authors to be due to the catalytic role of oxygen during oxidation.
Regeneration of ACs using cold and hot water washing and using heating at 300 C in air atmosphere showed that, after the first adsorption run, the capacity of carbon for hydrogen sulfide adsorption significantly decreased (around 60%) due to irreversible adsorption in the most active adsorption cites located in small pores; subsequent runs revealed a more or less constant capacity. (248, 249) Boudou et al. could regenerate the H2S-adsorbed AC sorbents by heating for 10 min in flowing N2 at 500 C. (250) Although inert atmosphere can be maintained at laboratory scales, the possibility of self-ignition at such high temperatures of regeneration cannot be eliminated. Aging of ACs has shown that the sorbents having significant capacity after the first adsorption run are practically unwashable with water due to the deposition of bulky sulfur polymers that are resistant to oxidation. (251)
3.5.2 Structured Carbons
Structured nanoporous carbon materials may be broadly classified into two main kinds: graphene-based materials and carbon nanotubes (CNTs). Graphene is an allotrope of carbon that consists of a two-dimensional hexagonal lattice of single atomic layer of sp2-hybridized carbon atoms. Graphene-based materials may be further classified as pristine graphene, graphene oxide (GO), and reduced graphene oxide (rGO). (252) CNTs are cylindrical nanostructures that may be imagined as seamlessly rolled-up graphene sheets with channel diameters as small as 0.4 nm, (253) 1.4 nm in several studies, (254) and can be as high as 50 nm. (252) The CNTs can be open or closed with half-fullerene caps at either ends of the cylindrical structure. These single-walled CNTs (SWCNTs) are usually observed as closely packed bundles on a honeycomb lattice with typically 100 nanotubes (of 1.4 nm diameter) forming bundles of <20 nm diameter. (255) The adsorption sites in SWCNT bundles maybe classified into three kinds: inside each tube, interstitial channels between the tubes, and outer surface peripheral to the bundle. The surface area for these materials may range from over 2500 m2/g for a SWCNT to as low as 800 m2/g for bundles of infinite diameter. (255) SWCNTs of varying channel diameters can also arrange in the form of several concentric cylinders to form multi-walled nanotubes (MWNTs).
Several groups have theoretically investigated the role of defects in the adsorption of H2S on the graphene surface, mainly for sensor applications. (256-259) Depending on the position of binding, adsorption energies of H2S on pristine graphene were found to be between 10 and 16 kJ/mol, but having a defect site with the sulfur atom of H2S pointing toward the defect resulted in a much stronger binding (88 kJ/mol). (256) In another study, three different graphene structures (pristine, with divacancy, and with the inclusion of nitrogen in graphene) were investigated, and the binding energies were found to be 1.6, 1.3, and 2.5 kJ/mol, respectively. (257) Borisova et al. investigated the effect of vacancy in graphene and found that H2S adsorbed by forming weak SC covalent bonds with the atoms surrounding the single vacancy. (258) In addition to the single vacancy and divacancies in graphene described above, there can be several other defect types; one such defect is the StoneWales (SW) defect that has four hexagons fused into two alternating pentagons and heptagons. Hegde et al. studied H2S binding to the carbon site of pristine graphene, SW defect site, and BN sites of BN-doped graphene through first-principles DFT with van der Waals (vdW) interactions. (259) While the adsorption of H2S is weak at both C and BN sites, with a binding energy of 15 kJ/mol, it is significantly stronger at the SW defect site with a binding energy of 26 kJ/mol. In the relaxed geometries, the sulfur atom of H2S points toward graphene (at a distance 3.14 Å) at C and BN sites, while the molecules H atoms point toward graphene (at a distance 2.84 Å) at the SW defect site. There seem to be significant differences in the various predictions for H2S adsorption on graphene; these differences may be due to different levels of theories employed for the independent studies. A consistent treatment of all defect types will be important in order to understand, quantitatively, the role of graphene defects in H2S adsorption.
There are several studies employing DFT for adsorption of H2S on metal-doped graphene. (256, 260-265) Strong adsorption was found due to a large binding energy (615 kJ/mol for 1 H2S/Pt system and 75 kJ/mol of H2S for the 7 H2S/Pt system) and short PtH2S bond length compared to those of the H2S/graphene system. (260) Zhang et al. reported binding energies of 16, 64, 174, and 185 kJ/mol for pristine, Ca-, Co-, and Fe-doped graphene, respectively. (256) Sharma and Verma calculated binding energies of 33, 42, 123, and 98 kJ/mol for pristine, B-, Al-, and Ga-doped graphene, respectively. (261) Pang et al. reported binding energies of 15, 81, 102, and 112 kJ/mol for pristine, Cr-, Cu-, and W-doped graphene, respectively. (265) These highly energetic interactions of H2S with metal-doped graphene are mainly of interest for sensor applications; however, they may have potential usefulness in adsorbents for ultra-deep sulfur removal of natural gas as the final polishing step for direct-methane fuel cells. (170)
The effect of the presence of S atom on graphene on the adsorption of H2S was investigated using DFT. (266) Two types of systems were investigated: S-functionalized graphene, where an S atom was added on pristine graphene, and S-doped graphene, where an S atom was added to the single-vacancy defect of graphene. Pristine graphene showed adsorption energies of 34 kJ/mol, while S-functionalized graphene showed energies as high as 170 kJ/mol due to covalent bond formation between S and H2S for configurations with H atoms pointing away from the graphene plane. Both physisorption and chemisorption were observed, depending upon CS bond distances in the H2S/S-doped graphene complex before optimization.
Molecular simulations for adsorption on structured carbons in the literature give very inconsistent answers and use idealized structures that may not be experimentally realizable. (267-270) Neglect of electrostatic interactions for the adsorbent in studies involving polar sorbate molecules may result in incorrect predictions of sorbatesorbent interactions. The potential of GO has not yet been extensively explored by molecular modeling, mainly due to the lack of an atomistic GO model for theoretical calculations. (271) Huang et al. have reported the controllable generation of atomistic GO models by a temperature-programmed reactive MD simulation. They further calculated the reactive adsorption of H2S and H2O/H2S mixtures on the as-generated atomistic GO structures. (271) H2S was observed to dissociate on the carbonyl functional groups, in agreement with the dynamic adsorption experiments; for the H2O/H2S mixtures, H2O molecules were preferentially adsorbed to the carbonyl sites, thus blocking the availability of active sites for H2S decomposition, again in agreement with the experimental findings.
Mohamadalizadeh et al. investigated the sorption of pure H2S on AC, MWNTs, CNTs decorated with tungsten nanoparticles (W-CNTs), and amino-functionalized CNTs (F-CNTs). (272) Although these CNT-based materials have a surface area (100 m2/g) lower than that of AC (1000 m2/g), the saturation capacities for these systems (at 10 bar and 20 C) did not differ drastically, and CNTs showed better regenerability compared to AC.
3.6 Composite Materials
3.6.1 Metal Oxides/Mesoporous Silica
While metal oxide sorbents show high affinity for H2S, they suffer from limitations such as loss in surface area and porosity, and this subsequently results in degraded performance during cyclic sulfidation and regeneration. Ordered mesoporous molecular sieves that allow narrow pore sizes (16100 Å) tailored through the choice of surfactant, auxiliary chemicals, and reaction conditions were first discovered in the early 1990s. (273, 274) This seminal discovery enabling uniform pore sizes of mesoporous materials with high surface areas opened up a new area for novel heterogeneous catalysts.
Wang et al. for the first time investigated adsorption of H2S on metal-oxide-impregnated mesoporous silica, ZnO/SBA-15 (275) and Fe2O3/SBA-15. (276) The breakthrough capacities mentioned by those authors are not in accord with the breakthrough times they report; using the details of the experimental setup, we calculated new breakthrough capacities which are reported in Table 9. In an inert medium, H2S reacts chemically with metal oxides, and hence, at most the adsorbed amount can correspond to 100% utilization of the metal oxide on the high-surface-area substrates. However, these two studies show H2S adsorption far exceeding the theoretical maximum, suggesting that Claus reaction occurs between H2S and O2 from the air in the feed and the metal oxide functions as catalyst for this reaction rather that itself reacting with H2S to form metal sulfide.

Dhage et al. studied room-temperature H2S adsorption on transition-metal-promoted ZnO, impregnated on high-surface-area (550 m2/g) SiO2. (277) The ZnO/SiO2 system showed much higher absolute breakthrough capacities as well as percentage Zn utilization compared to their unsupported commercial counterparts from BASF and Sud-Chemie (see Table 9). It was observed that the sulfur capacity oscillated, reproducibly, with the number of cycles rather than monotonically increasing or decreasing. Using dopants such as Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, and Cu improved the utilization of ZnO, with the effect from copper being most prominent, changing the ZnO utilization at saturation from an already high 64% to about 93%. This increase does not seem to improve with the amount of copper, since the saturation capacities remained nearly unchanged upon increasing the Cu:Zn ratio from 0.05 to 0.25 at the same overall metal oxide loading. DFT studies showed that there is a significant energetic discrimination between H2S binding to a Cu2+ versus a Zn2+ site; this difference is smaller for H2O. (278) On a ZnO surface with some Zn2+ sites substituted with Cu2+, there can be a displacement of H2O with H2S at the Cu2+ surface sites. This is yet another explanation for the promoter effect by copper, in addition to several other arguments such as surface area and diffusion invoked earlier. Yang and Tatarchuk (279) also carried out similar studies and found significantly enhanced utilization by doping ZnO with copper or silver. In another study, they studied Fe- and Mn-promoted H2S sorbents supported on silica and found higher metal utilization compared to undoped ZnO; however, no significant preference was observed for Fe or Mn. (280) For the first time, real-time in situ electron spin resonance (ESR) spectroscopy was performed during reactive adsorption of H2S. It was inferred that the surface of the sorbents is enriched with Fe promoter cations, while the Mn3+ promoter cations are located within the supported ZnO nanocrystallites. In situ experiments over multiple cycles may help to further elucidate the mechanism behind the oscillatory behavior.
Hussain et al. investigated the effect of different supports for ZnO; SBA-15 allows much higher breakthrough capacities as well as ZnO utilization. (281) This further highlights the importance of designing increasingly improved supports for metal oxides and suggests that Cu-Zn mixed oxides doped on SBA-15 may demonstrate a high capacity. In addition to capacity, stable performance of the adsorbent over several regeneration cycles is an important factor that may impact the economic viability of the process; in general, it is hard to reproducibly achieve the capacity of fresh adsorbents. (284-286) Generally, nanoparticles exhibit a tendency to grow into larger crystallites during the process of high-temperature regeneration. Inspired by the work of Prieto et al., who developed a highly stable methanol synthesis catalyst of Cu-ZnO nanoparticles on SBA-15, (288) Elyassi et al. investigated this adsorbent for H2S removal, resulting in extremely high and fully regenerable breakthrough capacities and ZnO utilization over five regeneration cycles. (282)
The major drawback of such composite sorbents is that the active component forms only a small fraction of the overall mass of the material, so even though high metal oxide utilizations can be achieved, the absolute amount of H2S that can be removed per unit mass of the adsorbent remains low. Attempts to increase the loading of metal oxide have not succeeded in increasing the H2S capacity without loss in % utilization. (283, 284, 287) Future research to increase the fraction of the active material in the composite with high utilization of the active component and high regenerability of the sorbents will help develop even better materials.
3.6.2 Supported Amines
Supported amine adsorbents can be broadly classified into three classes: Class 1 constitutes adsorbents with physically loaded amine species, Class 2 adsorbents contain a covalent link between the amine and the solid support, mostly via silane chemistry or via polymeric supports with amine-containing side chains, and Class 3 adsorbents comprise porous supports upon which aminopolymers are polymerized in situ, starting from an amine-containing monomer. (289) Class 3 materials combine the higher amine loadings of class 1 materials and the enhanced stability of class 2 materials due to aminesupport covalent linkages. (290, 291)
Huang et al. first reported on H2S removal using supported amines by employing high-surface-area silica supports (silica xerogel (816 m2/g) and MCM-48 (1389 m2/g)) functionalized with with 3-aminopropyl (CH2CH2CH2NH2) groups. (292) Adsorption/desorption was measured for pure-component H2S, CO2, and CH4, with and without moisture. At atmospheric pressure and temperature, the CO2/amino group ratio was observed to be 0.7 and 0.9 for xerogel and MCM-48, respectively. These ratios are 0.08 and 0.05 for CH4 and 0.29 and 0.25 for H2S at the highest measurement pressure of 0.001 atm (1000 ppmv) for xerogel and MCM-48, respectively. The sorbents could be almost completely regenerated by pressure swing or temperature swing at 75 C. The results indicated that the presence of water vapor doubled the amount of CO2 adsorbed and barely affected the H2S adsorption.
Zhou et al. explored Class 1 adsorbents by physically loading triethanolamine (C6H15O3N; TEA) on silica gel (335 m2/g). (293) Due to the weaker basicity of TEA, its sorption capacity is nearly 100 times less than that of amine-modified silicas. (292) The breakthrough capacity doubled on loading the silica gel with 20 wt% of TEA and increased 5-fold when the loading was increased to a mere 27.5 wt%. There is no clear explanation for this sudden rise in adsorption, except that small selective pores that are otherwise unexposed to TEA may get filled with TEA at a higher loading of 27.5 wt%. In a subsequent study, the authors used this system for studying a multi-cycle pressure swing adsorption setup. (294) In a follow-up work, the authors synthesized SBA-15 as a high specific surface area TEA carrier and reported that the amount of H2S adsorbed on the TEA-modified SBA-15 is 1.85 times more than that on the TEA-modified silica gel. (295) Xue and Liu tried another tertiary amine, methyl-diethyl-amine, loaded on SBA-15, and found an optimal amine loading of 60 wt% for an H2S breakthrough capacity of 0.1 mmol/g. (296) Although the adsorbed amine is stated to be methyldiethylamine, such low loadings, comparable to those for TEA, are more representative of methyldiethanolamine.
In another study, physically loaded polyethylenimine (PEI) particles on mesoporous molecular sieves MCM-41 at 50 wt% loading were explored for low-temperature H2S adsorption at 90 C and 10 ppmv inlet concentration. (297) The adsorbent could maintain an outlet concentration of 0.04 ppmv. The utility of these sorbents for natural gas sweetening at higher H2S concentrations needs to be investigated. In yet another study, linear PEI was dispersed inside the meso-channels of a SBA-15 framework, allowing interaction of amine groups in PEI with silanol groups on SBA-15. (298) The breakthrough and saturation capacities increased with inlet H2S concentrations of 2000, 4000, and 6000 ppmv in the ranges 0.68, 1.18, 1.48 and 1.50, 2.06, 2.38 mmol/g, respectively. The saturation value for amine-grafted sorbents at 1000 ppmv is 0.56 mmol/g. (292) So unlike TEA, PEI-modified supports show higher affinity for H2S, probably due to higher basicity of PEI, but possibly due to higher swelling of PEI compared to TEA. This is an open question that can be addressed perhaps by molecular simulations. The presence of moisture proved to enhance the adsorption capacity since only one amine group is needed per H2S molecule in the presence of moisture, versus two in its absence. However, moisture also resulted in a decrease in H2S desorption rates. The same authors also studied the effects of the operating temperature (2275 C), gas hourly space velocity (GHSV; 3371011 h1), amount of PEI loading, and different molecular sieve supports (MCM-41, MCM-48, and SBA-15). (299) The structure of the mesoporous molecular sieves influences the kinetic capacity of the supported PEI sorbents; large pore size and three-dimensional channel structure favor higher breakthrough capacity. A decrease in temperature favors both breakthrough and saturation capacities, while a decrease in GHSV enhances the breakthrough capacity. The amount of PEI loading has a strong synergetic influence on the sorption performance: 50 wt% PEI on SBA-15 gives the best breakthrough capacity, while 65 wt% PEI on SBA-15 shows the highest saturation capacity. The developed sorbents exhibit a breakthrough capacity as high as 0.79 mmol/g and a saturation capacity of 3.02 mmol/g at 22 C using 4000 ppm H2S, 20% H2 in bulk N2. In addition, the developed sorbents can be regenerated easily at mild conditions (75100 C), with sorption capacity maintained over eight cycles.
The studies discussed so far did not involve H2S adsorption in the presence of CO2, which is known to be much more acidic compared to H2S. Ma et al. have made significant progress by finding an exceptional dependence of these sorbents on temperature for CO2 and H2S competitive sorption and developing an innovative sorption process. (300) These PEI/SBA-15 sorbents show an exceptionally high CO2 loading at 75 C (3.2 mmol/g at 0.15 atm), but the lower kinetic barrier for H2S compared to CO2, which may be attributed to the faster proton-transfer reaction mechanism in the case of H2S, results in higher H2S breakthrough capacities at a lower temperature of 22 C. The authors proposed a two-stage process, with the first column being operated at 75 C for CO2 removal and the second column at 22 C for H2S removal (see Figure 13). Yoosuk and co-workers carried out similar two-stage studies for PEI loaded on low-cost fumed silica (fSi) and also investigated regeneration studies over multiple cycles. (301) Although the authors observed high breakthrough capacities for both CO2 and H2S for pure-component adsorption at 80 and 30 C, respectively, in the mixture adsorption with two-column configuration, the working capacity of CO2 was enhanced from 2.2 to about 3.5 mmol/g, while that of H2S decreased from the expected 1.2 to about 0.05 mmol/g. This reduced performance for H2S compared to the system introduced by Ma et al. can be attributed to two factors: (i) the difference in CO2 and H2S pure-component adsorption at 22 C for PEI/SBI-15 is much higher compared to the difference at 30 C for PEI/fSi, and (ii) the mixture feed contained a very high concentration of CO2 (20%) compared to H2S (0.36%) in the work of Yoosuk et al.; these values were 2.4% and 0.40%, respectively, for the work of Ma et al. These differences demonstrate the importance of choice of process conditions in selecting optimal sorbents. Similar to the discovery of novel zeolites for natural gas purification through a combined material screening and process optimization approach, (302) process optimization in materials selection for supported amines can help discover optimal sorbents.

In spite of these exciting properties, the powder nature of ordered mesoporous silica inhibits its direct usage in industrial packed columns due to very high pressure drops. Chen et al. investigated hierarchical porous silica supports for PEI. They can be easily formed as monoliths, which can be directly used in the fixed bed without any shaping process. (303) The largest breakthrough capacity of these sorbents was 1.27 mmol/g, about 60% higher than that of PEI/SBA-15 (0.79 mmol/g) or MCM-41 (0.81 mmol/g), although the test for the former was carried out at a lower inlet H2S concentration and a higher GHSV. (299) A new parameter, polymerization degrees of PEI (423, 600, 15000, 750000), was investigated, and it was found that the sorbent with a PEI molecular weight of 600 had the best sorption property. The authors propose that PEI with higher polymerization degree should have very large steric hindrance and low fluidity, restraining the internal diffusion of H2S and lowering the amine utilization, while PEI (423), a mixture of linear monomers and branch polymers, may be partially consumed or volatilized during the impregnation and drying, resulting in the decrease of efficient amine groups.
Belmabkhout et al. studied triamine-grafted (CH2CH2CH2NHCH2CH2NHCH2CH2NH2) pore-expanded mesoporous silica (TRI-PE-MCM-41) for adsorption of dry CO2, H2S, and CH4 and found a much higher affinity for CO2 and H2S compared to CH4 (see Figure 14). (304) Binary SH2S/CO2 varied from 70 to 10 upon varying the H2S concentrations from 5 to 100 ppm. (305) These materials thus provide a promising solution to single-step H2S and CO2 removal. Such simultaneous removal is desirable if re-injection of concentrated sour gas stream into empty gas fields is preferred over conversion of H2S to elemental sulfur by the Claus process. H2S adsorption isotherms in the temperature range of 2580 C are available from two different studies, and both predict an isosteric heat of adsorption between 40 and 20 kJ/mol with increasing loading; the low-loading heats of adsorption can be as high as 100 kJ/mol. (305, 306)

Another Class 1 adsorbent study employed SBA-15 loaded with hexamethylenetetraamine for H2S removal from a stream containing 9000 ppm H2S in CH4; the highest loading was observed for 50 wt% amine loading with a capacity of 0.75 mmol/g, stable over 10 cycles when overnight regeneration was conducted using N2 at 100 C. (307) In general, all sorbents in this category can be fully regenerated under mild temperature conditions and are shown to maintain a constant capacity for several cycles in most of the studies. Efforts toward reducing the regeneration time will increase the productivity of these sorbents.
3.6.3 Zeolite/Polymer
Bhandari et al. developed hollow fibers with polymer binder, impregnated with high loadings of sulfur-selective zeolite sorbent fillers (see Figure 15). (308) Cellulose acetate formed the binder and zeolite NaY formed the filler for these hollow fibers with high sorbent loadings and good strength. Although the hollow fiber morphology is representative of contact in a membrane process, it should be noted that the fibers here are used as adsorbents. The fibersorbent morphology was characterized using equilibrium sorption, gas permeation, SEM, and EDX. These sorbents were shown to be very effective for low-concentration (30 ppm) H2S removal, especially when compared to a packed-bed process, and were found to be fully regenerable by application of heat (120 C under N2).

3.6.4 MetalOrganic Framework/Graphite Oxide
It was envisioned that the GO and MOF composites would increase the dispersive forces in a highly porous MOF structure via dense nanoporous GO layers (546 wt%). (186) Petit and co-workers studied GO composites with HKUST-1 and found a synergistic effect on sorption capacity (9 mg/g for GO, 92 mg/g for HKUST-1, and 199 mg/g for composite with 5 wt% GO). The breakthrough capacities measured at room temperature using 1000 ppm H2S in moist air were not found to correlate with the measured porosity of the composites, suggesting a mechanism in addition to physisorption contributing to the overall sorption. Indeed the adsorbent bed changed color from light blue (hydrated copper) to black (CuS). Ebrahim et al. found that adsorption capacities increased by 85% for composites with sulfur-doped graphite due to the presence of moisture compared to dry conditions. (309) Those authors suggested that, under moist conditions, water acts as a screening factor, blocking the direct attack of H2S/SO2 on the copper centers and preserving the structure to some degree. They found that the catalytic effect of the modified graphene phase results in the formation of SO2 with a much higher H2S breakthrough capacity of 241  6 mg/g.
In another study, Huang et al. prepared composites using MOF-5 and GO in the presence of glucose. (310) GO enhanced the dispersive forces in MOF-5, as demonstrated by higher H2S uptake, but beyond the optimal loading of 5.25%, GO led to collapse of the MOF crystal structure. At 5.25% GO loading, composites with and without glucose have surface areas of 1062 and 295 m2/g, respectively; the respective breakthrough capacities of these materials using 100 ppm H2S in N2 are 130.1 and 31.9 mg/g. The authors suggest that glucose can restrain the distortion of the composite material due to polymerization of glucose under hydrothermal conditions; these short polymers fill in the structure to support the framework, and some may even react with the functional groups on the GO (see Figure 16). While this approach provides a route to stabilize such composite materials, performance and structural reversibility of these sorbents on regeneration need to be investigated.

3.6.5 Metal (Hydr)oxide/Graphite Oxide
Several studies report on the Claus reaction between H2S and air on composites of metal (hydr)oxide and GO, (312-323) with breakthrough H2S capacities as high as 150 mg/g of adsorbent at 1000 ppm H2S in air. Lonkar et al. demonstrated an easy in situ fabrication of nanostructured graphene/CuO (324) and graphene/ZnO (311) composites without the use of any solvents, toxic-reducing agents, or organic modifiers. The metal oxide particles in the presence of graphene had a size of sub-20 nm, compared to metal oxide particles of 50 nm synthesized by the same method (see Figure 17). At ambient temperature and with a feed composition of 0.15% H2S, 0.41% CO2, and 99.4% CH4, a 50 wt% composite material led to over twice the capacity of pristine ZnO (see Table 10). Regeneration of these high-capacity materials with the advantage of easy synthesis is an important aspect that should be considered in the future.

3.6.6 Metal Oxide/Activated Carbon
Fauteux-Lefebvre et al. embedded iron nanoparticles in carbon nanofilaments and tested these for H2S removal under a wide range of operating conditions. (325) Fe K-edge spectra showed that iron was in its oxidized states (Fe2O3 and Fe3O4). Even at higher temperature of 300 C, low breakthrough capacities were observed. Higher metal loadings of 28 wt% could not improve the H2S uptake (see Table 11). Zhang and co-workers studied various loadings of MnO2 on AC under a wide range of synthesis and operating conditions and observed capacities as high as 110 mg/g for a 50 wt% MnO2 loading at only 20 ppm H2S. (326) In another study, sorbents were prepared by finely dispersing mixed ZnO and CuO onto a commercial AC at fixed total metal loading (10 wt%) and Cu:Zn atomic ratios ranging from 0:1 to 1:1. (327) The surface area was hardly affected due to the high dispersion of the metal oxides; moderately high H2S capacities could be achieved. Only 1827% of the capacity could be regenerated at 400 C, and even at a temperature of 620 C, only 4046% of the capacity could be regenerated.

Complete regeneration and reusability of an adsorbent may or may not be feasible; therefore, it is important to consider the eventual disposal of spent adsorbents. This becomes particularly important for H2S-removal applications, since contact of an improperly disposed adsorbent with air or water may result in a concentrated release into the environment and can have very serious health implications. Some of the spent metal oxides, such as iron sulfide, can be pyrophoric and can release acid gases into the atmosphere. Dissolution of these gases in water bodies can have unacceptable effects on the ecosystem. Some of the methods for treating spent adsorbents include regeneration followed by inert purge, flooding with liquid water, and steam purging. (328) The cost of an adequate spent-adsorbent treatment method may have large bearings on this additional cost.
4 Membrane Separation
As natural gas consumption is expected to nearly double in the coming 25 years and the raw natural gas has a varying composition depending on its origin, there is an opportunity for membrane technology to remove impurities including water, carbon dioxide, nitrogen, hydrogen sulfides, and other hydrocarbons. (329) Bhide and Stern investigated the relative economics of cellulose acetate (CA) membrane technology and gas absorption using DEA and found that the membrane process for CO2 removal is more economical to meet the 2% specification over the entire range of CO2 feed concentrations (>5%). (330) Presence of H2S in the feed stream resulted in an increased separation cost for meeting the specifications of both H2S and CO2 (4 ppm and 2%, respectively). Unlike the superior performance of membranes over the entire range of acid gas concentration for CO2 alone, the presence of H2S allowed membranes to be economical only at higher total acid gas (H2S + CO2) concentrations. While this analysis was carried out for CA membranes with SCO2/CH4 = 21 and SH2S/CH4 = 50, (330) it should be noted that the SH2S/CH4 values for such membranes range between only 15 and 30. Membranes with higher selectivities and permeabilities than the CA membranes employed in this economic analysis may significantly expand the regime for superior membrane performance over gas absorption. Additionally, hybrid processes involving membranes for bulk acid gas removal, followed by chemical absorption or adsorption in the polishing step, can drive the overall process toward better economics.
4.1 Polymeric Membranes
Approximating solubility with the Henrys law and diffusivity with the Ficks law, and approximating the concentrations on the permeate side to be negligible compared to that on the feed side, the permselectivity of a polymer membrane, Sij, in differentiating two species, i and j, can be expressed as
(7)
where Pi, Fi, pi, Di, and Ki are the permeability, flux, partial pressure, Ficks diffusion constant, and Henrys constant for species i. The ratio Di/Dj can be viewed as the transport selectivity indicating the relative speed of the two components and is mainly governed by the molecular shapes and sizes. The ratio Ki/Kj can be viewed as the sorption selectivity and is governed by the relative gas solubilities in the membrane material.
The glass transition temperature, Tg, characterizes the range of temperatures over which a hard and relatively brittle glassy amorphous state of the polymer transitions into a soft and viscous rubbery state. Polymer chains are trapped in a frozen state at T < Tg, but T > Tg allows for significant motion of the chains. Glassy polymers offer size-selective separation by virtue of differential diffusivity; in contrast, rubbery polymers suffer reduced size selectivity from increased elasticity of the polymer chains. The kinetic diameters of H2S (3.6 Å) and CO2 (3.3 Å) are smaller than that of CH4 (3.8 Å); this suggests the possibility of a diffusion-based selectivity. The critical temperatures for these gases are 373, 304, and 191 K, respectively, suggesting that, compared to methane, the acid gases will interact more strongly with the polymer and also allow for sorption-based selectivity. Although both rubbery and glassy polymers can separate CO2 and H2S from natural gas, in practice, CO2 is best separated by glassy polymer membranes (maximizing size selectivity), whereas H2S, which is larger and more condensable than CO2, is best separated by rubbery polymer membranes (maximizing sorption selectivity). (331) Although plants based on glassy CA membranes (Tg  110 C) are widely used for CO2 removal from natural gas, these membranes also possess SH2S/CH4  1530. (332-334) The contribution of diffusion and sorption to this overall selectivity is unclear; H2S/CH4 sorption isotherms will help understand the relative proportions of the two factors. Using CA to reduce H2S to pipeline specifications (4 ppm) results in vast over-processing as far as the CO2 concentrations are concerned. Thus, just like liquid absorbents with a higher H2S/CO2 selectivity, there is a need for membranes with higher SH2S/CO2.
Permselectivity can be obtained either from a real mixture experiment or by modeling mixture transport using pure-gas permeabilities and sorption isotherms. While it is most common to report the ideal selectivity (ratio of pure-gas permeabilities), it may be possible to adopt a more sophisticated approach to include the effects of multi-component sorption and diffusion. (335, 336) It is well known in the literature that the assumption of ideality grossly over-predicts selectivity for polymeric membranes if one of the species strongly absorbs/adsorbs onto the polymer. Absorption-induced swelling of the polymer increases chain mobility and gas flux, a phenomenon commonly known as membrane plasticization. Increased chain mobility lowers Tg, potentially transforming a membrane from glassy to rubbery and adversely affecting the size-selective term, Di/Dj. CO2-induced swelling of CA membranes results in a much lower CO2/CH4 mixture selectivity compared to the ideal selectivty (35 vs 50 at 4 atm); the effect is more pronounced at higher CO2 partial pressures (32 vs 80 at 12 atm). (337) Other impurities, such as light hydrocarbons, water, very low concentration of aromatics, etc., can also have a plasticization effect on membrane permeances. In addition to plasticization, glassy materials suffer from physical aging where the polymer chains slowly relax into a preferred high-density form by a reduction in free volume. (338) This type of aging effect can reduce membrane permeabilities significantly over the average 25-year life of a membrane used in natural gas service. (331)
Kulprathipanja et al. synthesized two-component membranes comprising of a mixture of polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) and poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) plasticizers, having molecular weights between 200 and 600, cast upon a porous polysulfone (PSf) support that was pre-treated with glycerol. (340, 341) Glycerol alters the pores of the support, thus increasing the permeability of hydrogen-bonding H2S (see Table 12). These membranes are of the asymmetric type; a very thin, dense surface layer or skin is supported upon an integrally attached, much thicker supporting layer. In this case, the selective skin is rubbery, while the support is glassy. The authors reported very high H2S/CH4 ideal selectivities between 115 and 185; however, the mixed gas selectivities measured later are smaller by a factor of 48. (344, 363) Both PDMS and PEG belong to the class of rubbery membranes with Tg = 127 and 67 C, respectively; therefore, it is unlikely that plasticization results in lower mixture selectivities. It is possible, however, that these strongly absorbing membranes are being operated at both feed and permeate pressures in the saturated loading regime. Several studies report ideal and mixture H2S/CH4 selectivities in PDMS membranes of 11, (341, 342, 362) indicating the crucial role of PEG plasticizers in enhancing the selectivity toward H2S. Unlike CA and PDMS membranes, these two-component membranes present high SH2S/CO2 as well, possibly by benefitting from the hydrogen-bonding character of H2S. However, this raises concerns about the influence of H2O impurities on such membranes, and this can be additionally important considering that PEG is soluble in H2O. Molecular simulations can possibly explain the role of PEG and also the influence of impurities on membrane performance.

Another class of polymer membranes, commercially known as the Pebax membranes, are composed of etheramide block copolymers, where the polyether block imparts the flexible character to the rigid polyamide block. Various grades of Pebax membranes have been tested for acid gas removal, and these membranes yield ideal and mixture SH2S/CH4 values in the ranges 140190 and 3570, respectively. (333, 343, 344, 359) Similar to PDMS and PEG, the Pebax membranes also belong to the class of rubbery membranes with Tg < 50 C; as mentioned earlier, the drop in mixture selectivity compared to ideal selectivity may be due to operation in the saturated loading regime. These membranes demonstrate SH2S/CO2 between 3.4 and 4.5. The presence of H2O impurities was examined by using a feed gas stream saturated with H2O vapor; no detrimental effect on the selectivities was observed, but the fluxes decreased by 4045%. (364) Chatterjee et al. synthesized two poly(ether urethanes) and two poly(ether urethane ureas) using PEG or poly(propylene glycol) (PPG) for the ether block; the polyurethanes are structurally related to the Pebax polymers. (333) Membranes with PEG blocks yield much higher H2S/CH4 and H2S/CO2 selectivities compared to the ones with PPG blocks, but with no significant difference in the permeabilities; this maybe attributed to the higher mass fraction of polar hydroxyl groups in PEG compared to PPG. Very high selectivities reaching up to 100 for H2S/CH4 and 4.8 for H2S/CO2 were observed by reducing the temperature from 35 to 20 C.
Yet another class of rubbery membranes that offer high selectivity for H2S/CH4 and H2S/CO2 separation (6080 and 49, respectively) are substituted polyphosphazenes (PPZ), where the substituents are predominantly 2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethanol (MEE) and 4-methoxyphenol. (349, 350) Orme et al. explained that the flexible backbone of PPZ has a low rotational energy barrier due to pπdπ bonding between nitrogen and phosphorus. Polyether pendant groups, such as MEE, are linear chains of sp3-hybridized atoms which have many degrees of rotational freedom; thus, they do not significantly hinder the inherent flexibility of the backbone. (350) On the other hand, aromatic substituents hinder the backbone flexibility, in turn increasing Tg. This work showed a surprising result that lowering Tg resulted in increased permeabilities and separation factors at the same time. Similar ideal and mixture selectivities suggest that these rubbery membranes are operated in the regime where the polymer is not saturated with the more strongly absorbing gas molecules: the operating pressure is only 2.1 bar as opposed to several tens of atmospheres for previously mentioned mixture experiments. MEE is hydrophilic and makes the PPZ hydrophilic; at 100% MEE substitution, the resulting PPZ is soluble in water. In contrast, aromatic substituents impart hydrophobicity. The effect of moisture in the feed stream on the performance of PPZ membranes remains to be investigated. These 100200 μm thick membranes were supported on ceramic supports with 0.2 μm pores. Permeation properties of thin membranes are very different from those of thick films, and since the selective layer of membranes in industrial use is usually only 0.11.0 μm thick, (365) performance for thinner substituted-PPZ membranes remains to be seen.
Quinn and co-workers have explored facilitated transport membranes for selective removal of H2S from natural gas mixtures. (345, 346) These membranes are based on the polyelectrolyte, poly(vinylbenzyltrimethyl ammonium fluoride) (PVBTAF), and show exceptionally high mixture selectivity for selective removal of H2S and CO2 from CH4 (>800 and >400, respectively). Using NMR data, the authors show that CO2 reacts with hydrated fluoride ions to form mobile bicarbonate ions, HCO3. The permeance of both CO2 and H2S increased with decreasing feed partial pressure of the respective gases, a phenomenon observed for membranes operated in the saturated loading regime; permselectivity data imply that both CO2 and H2S compete for the same reaction sites, hydrated fluoride ions. (345) The authors also report that the membranes show no deterioration after 30 days of continuous operation but react irreversibly with trace levels of sulfur-containing contaminants, such as CS2 and COS, that are common to cylinder H2S. The permselectivity of these membranes was increased by 34 times without reduction in selectivity by using fluoride-containing salts such as cesium fluoride. (346) The performance of these membranes is very sensitive to the relative humidity of the feed stream.
Unlike conventional microporous materials such as zeolites and activated carbon, polymeric materials possess advantageous properties, such as solution-processability and precise control over chemical functionality. However, polymeric membranes suffer from large inherent densities and, as a result, low permeabilities in general. Budd and co-workers developed a new class of polymeric membranes that not only are solution-processable but also possess intrinsic microporosity. (366) This new class of materials, known as polymers of intrinsic microporosity (PIMs), are a result of contorted shape and extreme rigidity of planar units fused together by rigid spirocyclic linkers. These kinks at the spiro-centers prevent efficient packing to form a dense polymer matrix, which in turn results in a material with intrinsic microporosity. (367) These materials are microporous (pores smaller than 2 nm) and possess a considerable fraction of pores that are below 7 Å. (368) Hydroxyl-functionalized PIMs (PIM-6FDA-OH) demonstrated higher permeabilities than most traditional polyimides for sour gas sweetening application. (360, 369) Annealed PIM-6FDA-OH films were shown to resist plasticization up to much higher pressures compared to unannealed films and other 6FDA-based polyimide materials. These films were dried under vacuum at 100 C to remove any moisture prior to testing. However, since processed natural gas, although with low dew point temperatures, may contain finite moisture levels, future research for these very promising, but hydrophilic, membranes should consider the effects of moisture on gas sweetening.
Several other research groups have been investigating polymeric membranes for H2S removal, from the 1950s right up until today, (334, 339, 347, 348, 351-359, 361, 370-373) and the data from some of these papers is also presented in Table 12. To maximize the membrane area per unit volume, two main configurations are widely used: hollow fibers and flat sheets in the form of spiral-wound modules. Both these module types are commercially applied for CO2 removal from natural gas. (331)
4.2 Membranes for GasLiquid Contact
In general, synthesizing highly selective gas membranes that also offer high flux is an active area of industrial and academic research. An alternative technology that combines the advantages of high surface area per unit volume of membrane contactors with the selective absorption in amine-based liquid solutions was first developed for CO2 capture in 1985 by Qi and Cussler. (375, 376) Such gasliquid interfaces may be achieved by flowing a gas on the outside of a membrane configuration such as a hollow fiber and with liquid flowing within its lumen (see Figure 18). These gasliquid membrane contactors offer several advantages over conventional contacting devices, such as high surface area per unit contactor volume; independent control of gas and liquid flow rates without any flooding, loading, weeping, foaming, or entrainment problems; small size; known gasliquid interfacial area; and being modular and easy to scale up or down. (377) Important aspects of membrane contactors for acid gas removal, including liquid absorbents, membrane characteristics, combination of membrane and absorbent, mass transfer, and membrane modules, are critically discussed elsewhere by Mansourizadeh and Ismail. (377)

Asymmetric hollow-fiber membrane modules made of PSf and PESf, coupled with a concentrated alkaline NaOH solution, were investigated both experimentally and theoretically for the removal of H2S (see Table 13). (378) In general, the gas-phase diffusivity is about 4 orders of magnitude higher than the liquid-phase diffusivity. As a result, in the case of non-reactive absorption, the additional mass-transfer resistance contributed by a non-wetted membrane is significantly smaller than the resistance in the liquid phase. Thus, addition of a non-wetting membrane to a non-reactive gasliquid system results in a negligible decrease in the overall mass-transfer coefficient. A non-wetting solventmembrane combination can therefore greatly enhance the overall mass transfer (Koverall × ) of the soluble species from the gas phase to the liquid phase by virtue of higher surface area per unit volume (). Since reactive absorption in many cases shifts the rate-limiting step to the gas phase, having a wetted membrane can be beneficial over a non-wetted membrane in such cases. These are general guidelines and may vary from case to case, depending on the extent of equilibrium between a gasliquid pair. In a subsequent study, Li et al. developed a PVDF membrane, and due to its excellent chemical resistance, much higher H2S feed concentration could be investigated. (379) Unlike other membrane-based processes such as ultra-filtration or molecular sieving, very small pressure gradients need to be maintained across the gasliquid interface, just enough to prevent bubbling of the gas in the liquid phase, since the driving force for mass transfer is the chemical potential (concentration) gradient. The effect of an alternate alkaline medium such as sodium carbonate (Na2CO3) was also investigated, and complete removal of H2S could be achieved with short residence times (<0.1 s). (380) H2S removal in the presence of CO2 showed SH2S/CO2 = 180200, about 1 order of magnitude higher than that reported for packed towers (1030). (381) Note that here the selectivity is defined as the ratio of overall mass-transfer coefficients for H2S and CO2 and may vary with the operating conditions of the packed tower and the membrane module. With the hollow fibers, the selectivity increased by 33% for a 6-fold increase in gas/liquid ratio and by 50% for a 3-fold increase in gas pressure, and was insensitive to the inlet concentration of CO2 over a wide range (525%).

Marzouk et al. explored expanded polytetrafluoroethylene (ePTFE) hollow fibers for removal of high-concentration H2S from a binary gas mixture (2% H2S in CH4) at high pressures (up to 50 bar). (382, 384) PTFE is a highly non-reactive polymer, mainly due to the strong strength of carbonfluorine bonds; this non-reactivity allows the polymer to withstand highly corrosive H2S environments. Additionally, fluorocarbons are known to be very hydrophobic, thus repelling water or water-containing solutions and in turn preventing wetting of the hollow fibers. It was observed that the ratio of flux in the case of NaOH solution to that in the case of distilled water (a physical absorbent) decreases from 4.5 at 1 bar to 1.35 at 50 bar. This seemingly small effect of alkaline solution at higher pressure amounts to 75% H2S removal for water and 100% H2S removal for 2 M NaOH solution. Performance for MEA was observed to be vey similar to that for NaOH. H2S flux rates were obtained with three different amines, i.e., MEA, DEA, and triethylenetetraamine (TETA), and it was shown that the flux followed the order TETA > MEA > DEA. TETA has four amino (Lewis base) sites, explaining its having the largest H2S flux. The steric hindrance in MEA is lower compared to that in DEA, allowing better interaction of the Lewis base site with H2S. The effect of simultaneous absorption of CO2 and H2S from a pressurized CO2H2SCH4 gas mixture was investigated using ePTFE and a commercially available diblock polymer, poly(tetrafluoroethylene-co-perfluorinated alkyl vinyl ether) (PFA). (384) The results proved that the PFA fibers are superior to the more common ePTFE mainly because of their smaller dimensions, higher porosity, and higher hydrophobicity. Utilizing PFA fibers in the future would lead to substantial reduction in the membrane area (10 times) and/or significant enhancement in the acid gas removal efficiency. Since the contact angles for ePTFE and PFA are 111.3 and 118.6, respectively, it is quite possible that a polymer with even higher hydrophobicity may further increase the membrane flux.
While liquid-phase resistance dominates mass transfer in the case of physisorption, (384) the gas-phase resistance dominates for reactive absorption in the liquid phase. (383) An increase in amine concentration in the absence of CO2 resulted in a decrease in the mass-transfer coefficient, and this was attributed to the enhanced wetting of the membrane resulting from reduced surface tension due to organic amines. (383) In the presence of CO2, however, MDEA concentration enhanced the removal efficiency of H2S as well as CO2; since MDEA is a tertiary amine, the CO2 molecules are not absorbed and stay in the gasliquid interface within the membrane, hindering the wetting of the membrane. The effect of temperature on the H2S removal efficiency was small, but it substantially decreased the CO2 removal efficiency and consequently enhanced the H2S selectivity. (383) Absorbent mixtures as well as acid gas mixtures affect the H2S and CO2 removal efficiencies in complex ways. While the logic presented in the paper by Hedayat et al. makes sense, there are multiple phenomena going on in this system at the same time, and it is hard to deconvolute the problem; insights from molecular simulations, both equilibrium and non-equilibrium, can play a role in improving the understanding of the underlying phenomena.
Recently, Esquiroz-Molina et al. studied the effect of pH for alkaline NaOH solution on the mass transfer of H2S in commercially available hollow-fiber membrane contactors made of hydrophobic polypropylene. (386) Theoretical gas side residence times were varied between 0.37 and 17 s, while the liquid side residence time was about 12 s. The authors determined a threshold pH of 10 (104 M), above which the reaction could be described as pseudo-first order with respect to H2S due to an excess of reactive hydroxide ions. At pH > 10, the reactive absorption in the liquid phase increases the liquid-side mass-transfer coefficient enough to make the reaction gas-phase controlled. The authors propose a NaOH pH of 11 (0.001 M) to be economically attractive; this value is several orders of magnitude smaller than the concentrations previously investigated in the literature. It should be noted, however, that dilute solvents can reduce the cost of solvents but will greatly increase the regeneration cost of the spent absorbent. Such a reduction in concentration may be justifiable only for a very high value solvent.
Several groups have modeled H2S removal using gasliquid contact over hollow-fiber membrane modules. (387-394) Some of the models considered non-wetting and partial wetting conditions, where the gas mixture and the solvent, respectively, fill the membrane pores. (388, 394) Axial and radial diffusion were considered inside the fiber, through the membrane, and within the shell using a two-dimensional (2D) mathematical model. (388) This 2D model was modified to account for the reversible reactions of all species involved in the chemical absorption of H2S in aqueous carbonate solution (389) and then further extended to systems involving the presence of CO2. (390) Amrei et al. presented a comprehensive model considering the entrance regions of momentum, energy, and mass transfers; compressibility of the gas phase as a function of gas-phase temperature, pressure, and composition; and variation of physical solubility of CO2 and H2S as a function of gasliquid interface temperature, pressure, and compositions. (393) Dynamic response of the membrane reactor to various types of pulses on the feed and solvent showed that the system was dynamically stable and reverted back to its previous operating point. It is worth noting that the modeling of flow in hollow-fiber contactors is not trivial. Inside the fiber, the assumption of a fully developed laminar parabolic velocity profile in a tube geometry works very well. However, due to poor knowledge of the shell-side geometry, the models for what happens on the outside of the hollow fibers may correlate one set of data but are rarely effective in general. (395, 396) Another issue about hollow-fiber membranes that is not addressed in many studies is the unstable gasliquid interface. To overcome this, Prasad and Sirkar put a higher static pressure on the phase which did not wet the membrane, pushing the interface back to a more stable location. (397) However, this may not work as well for polydisperse pores, and it is an issue that, if not addressed at the design stage, may lead to considerable performance problems in actual practice.
In conclusion, hollow-fiber membrane contactors have shown some promise for selective H2S removal; especially the uncommon H2S/CO2 selectivities are promising. A better understanding of the flow patterns may be obtained from reactive computational fluid dynamics. This will enable further insights into whether operating and design parameters such as wettability of the membrane have positive or detrimental effects in optimizing not only H2S capacity but also H2S/CH4 and H2S/CO2 selectivities.
4.3 Ceramic Membranes
Ceramic membranes have the potential to precisely control transport properties of molecules with different sizes, shapes, and interaction strength, in turn allowing sieving at molecular length scales. Maghsoudi and Soltanieh investigated the simultaneous separation of H2S and CO2 from CH4 using a ceramic membrane of CHA-type zeolite. (398) Since polar impurities such as H2O, due to their large permanent dipole moments, may affect membrane performance, there is a considerable value attached to exploring high-silica zeolite membranes. An approximately 20 μm thick silica membrane was synthesized on a porous α-alumina disk, with repeating the crystallization process thrice to seal defects as judged from N2 permeability tests. The elemental profiles for Al and Si along the cross section by EDX line scanning view showed that the zeolite layer has Si/Al  5. Before the actual permeance measurement, the feed and permeate sides were purged for 1 h with the desired feed and Ar, respectively, and Ar was also used as a carrier gas during the permeation measurements. Ternary mixture (2.13% CO2, 0.30% H2S in CH4) permeance was measured at room temperature, and the ratios of permeances for H2S/CH4 and CO2/CH4 were observed to be 3.24 and 5.3, respectively. When normalized by the ratio of feed concentrations, these values are 1050 and 240, respectively, suggesting that the potential for acid gas separation using zeolite membranes should be further explored.
4.4 Carbon-Based Membranes
Pristine graphene is a two-dimensional, single-atomic-layer, hexagonal lattice of sp2-hybridized carbon atoms that is completely impervious to liquids and gases, including atoms as small as helium (2.6 Å). (399) Perforated graphene membranes with sub-nanometer micropores, also known as porous graphene membranes, have shown promise for numerous separation applications. (400-408) Nanoporous defect formation in single-atomic layers of graphene using high-resolution TEM was reported by Hashimoto et al. (409) In another approach, bottom-up synthesis has also been demonstrated using phenylene rings as building units to form porous graphene. (410) Although porous graphene membranes have been explored for the selective molecular sieving of He, H2, CO2, Ar, O2, N2, CO, and CH4, there is no experimental measurement for H2S, which should be explored in the future.
It is important to note here that a successful gas separation using a single-layer graphene membrane has not been reported. Most measurements are for a few-layers-thick graphene oxide membranes. This is likely to have strong implications on separations involving polar species such as H2S due to the different binding affinities of polar species toward pristine graphene surface compared to the functionalized surface of graphene oxide. Lei et al. carried out MD simulations to probe the effect of the charges around the pore on the separation of a H2S/CH4 mixture using a porous graphene membrane. (411) The pore was formed by deleting 12 C atoms from the center of the sheet in the simulation box, and partial charges of 0.241 and +0.241 e were assigned to the carbon atoms in the first and second 12-carbon shells. For the charged-pore membrane, the flux nearly doubled for H2S and nearly halved for CH4, resulting in a 4-fold increase in selectivity compared to the uncharged-pore membrane. In another simulation study, Sun et al. investigated different pore sizes and shapes for graphene membranes and found H2S/CH4 selectivities in excess of 100 at reasonably high permeances. (412)
Another class of carbon-based membranes, carbon molecular sieve (CMS) membranes, which are prepared by the carbonization of polymeric precursors, have shown promising CO2/CH4 selectivity (35190) at high CO2 flux of 106108 mol/(m2·s·Pa). (413, 414) The utility of such membranes for selective H2S removal from natural gas streams remains to be explored.
Very recently, Wenz and Koros introduced a postsynthetic modification method using aromatic amines to bridge the sp2 domains in CMS membranes with the goal to prevent relaxation of the CMS to suppress physical aging (see Figure 19). (415) However, the modifications were found insufficient to yield aging-resistant membranes. This is an emerging field, and hopefully new synthetic techniques to prevent collapsing of CMS will emerge in the future.

Gilani and co-workers used vertically aligned CNT (VACNT) membranes, (416) functionalized with different amine groups, for separation of binary H2S/CH4 mixtures (see Figure 20). (417) Permselectivity values between 2.5 and 3 and H2S permeabilities between 3 × 107 and 8 × 107 mol/(m2·s·Pa) were observed, depending on the choice of functional groups. Linear amines with a short carbon chain length lead to a higher selectivity and H2S permeability; the order of selectivity and H2S permeability of membranes was obtained as butylamine > dodecylamine > sec-butylamine > octadecylamine.

Controlling aggregation of individual carbon membrane units, ensuring uniformity of thickness, and tuning precise distribution of defects are important challenges in the area of carbon-based membranes that are still not fully mature. Goh et al. have recently reviewed carbon-based membranes with a focus on water purification and identified five strategic areas for future research, namely, concentration polarization, fouling, stability, scalability, and cost. (252) Stacked graphene and surface-modified graphene are much more stable and scalable compared to single-layer graphene. Similarly, randomly aligned CNTs are more scalable compared to VACNT. Like in most research fields, even in carbon-based membranes, the pursuit of advanced performance faces competing characteristics such as scalability, stability, and cost-effectiveness.
4.5 Composite Membranes
Supported ionic liquid membranes (SILMs) consist of an IL embedded in a solid polymer matrix (support). SILMs with 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium tetrafluoroborate as the IL for its superior affinity to acidic gases, and PVDF as the polymer matrix for its hydrophobicity as well as stable physical and chemical properties, were tried for selective H2S removal. (418, 419) The permeability coefficients increased dramatically, especially for H2S, with an increase in the IL content of the membrane. This increase may be due to enhancement in diffusion, since solubility does not vary much with IL loading.
Wang et al. computationally studied the separation of an H2S/CH4 mixture in the UiO-66(Zr)-(COOH)2 MOF membrane and the mixed matrix membranes (MMMs) composed of polymer as the continuous phase and MOF as the dispersed phase. (420) GCMC simulations using generic force fields that are known to show reasonable adsorption estimates for MOFs were used to obtain equilibrium loading at the conditions of interest. MD simulations were then employed to calculate diffusivities considering framework flexibility, and equivalent results were obtained from simulations in the canonical and the microcanonical ensembles. With a combination of atomistic simulations and the MaxwellStefan formulation for permeation, (421) H2S/CH4 permselectivities of 200 for UiO-66(Zr)-(COOH)2, 250 for the different polymers, and between 2 and 60 for MMMs were estimated. Note that, for modeling the separation performance of MMMs, the permeability values of H2S/CH4 mixtures through polymeric membranes were taken from the experimental data available in the literature, while those through the MOF phase were taken from the simulation results. It was found that, for polymers with much lower H2S permeabilities compared to the MOF, MOF addition into its matrix increases the permeability by about an order of magnitude for 50% volume fraction of the MOF and the selectivity remains almost unchanged at the polymer permselectivity. However, for polymers with H2S permeabilities not lower than 2 orders of magnitude compared to the MOF permeability, both selectivity and permeability of the polymer increase upon MOF addition. In a subsequent study, Li et al. carried out molecular simulations using generic MOF force fields (shown to have worked reasonably accurately in many previous studies) to study the adsorption and membrane performance of UiO-66(Zr) and its functionalized derivatives for H2S removal from binary mixtures with CH4 and CO2. (422) UiO-66-(COOH)2 and UiO-66-COOH performed better than other functionalized derivatives; however, the performance of these adsorbents/membranes containing hydrophilic functional groups, in the presence of moisture, remains to be seen.
5 Cryogenic Distillation
Although the phase behavior of the CH4/H2S system was studied extensively in the 1950s, (423-425) there has been renewed interest in the study of these systems at additional state points, especially at higher pressures, in the past couple of years. (426-428) Coquelet et al. investigated phase equilibria from 87 to 40 C up to 140 bar, (426) and Perez et al. measured the mixture densities between 20 and 20 C and up to pressures of 300 bar. (428) Lange et al. also explored the complete pT diagram of the methanehydrogen sulfide system down 70 K and for pressures up to 2500 bar by tuning the parameters within a solidliquidvapor equation of state and validating against the available experimental data. (427)
Total, Institut Francais du Petrole, and its fully owned subsidiary, Prosernat, have developed a cryogenic process for bulk H2S removal from very sour gases, the SPREX (Special PRe-Extraction) process. (429) The pre-treatment step reduces the H2S content in the gas by producing a partially sweetened gas which can then be processed by a smaller sized amine sweetening unit; it also produces high-pressure liquid H2S (5065 bar) that can be easily re-injected into a geological reservoir. The minimum overhead temperature is limited to about 30 C, so as to remain above the hydrate formation temperature, ruling out the necessity of installing a dehydration unit upstream of the Sprex column. This temperature of 30 C limits the H2S concentration in the distillate to about 10%. However, the authors also describe an enhanced version, where the temperature can be reduced to 65 C without crystallizing CO2 or H2S, thereby reducing the H2S content in the overhead stream to 23%. The triple point of H2S is about 85 C, suggesting that the process is very close to where it can practically be, even if pre-drying is carried out to completely remove the moisture.
For many chemical separations, distillation has been the most straightforward and often long-lasting choice, unless an obvious better choice of separation was available. It is intriguing that, in the development of separation processes for gas sweetening, distillation has come into the picture only in the past decade or so. Distillation, in general, is a very energy-intensive process that requires boiling and condensing of the entire feed stream (a number of times for systems with low relative volatilities). However, for a raw gas stream (4.5 million S·m3/day) containing 35% H2S and 7% CO2, the capital expenditure, power consumption, and steam consumption of the amine process and the SPREX + amine process were reported to be 153 and 128 MM US$, 52 and 30 MW, and 46 and 34 MW, respectively. (429) This shows that distillation can indeed be more cost-effective and energy-efficient as a pre-treatment step, compared to amine absorption, for bulk acid gas removal. (429)
6 Outlook and Perspectives
Considering the wide range of hydrogen sulfide concentrations in different natural gas reservoirs, a need for a portfolio of efficient (multi-step) separation processes is evident. In addition to H2S removal, other competing goals such as CO2 removal, removal of other organic sulfur compounds, and moisture removal need to be considered where necessary. Before one can quantitatively compare many of the emerging materials described in this Review, further detailed investigations of these materials under conditions of interest (as discussed at appropriate places throughout the Review) are essential.
As far as liquid absorbents are concerned, processes based on alkanolamines have matured and been perfected over the past several decades. New research on amines for acid gas capture is evolving around developing solid supports, such as mesoporous silica, to uniformly disperse the amine functionalities, either physically or chemically bonded by silane chemistry, and to benefit from the advantages of adsorptive separations over absorptive separations. Since CO2 is more acidic than H2S, developing H2S-selective alkanolamines was a big challenge that was overcome for liquid absorbents. Similar breakthroughs for supported amines will be essential for efficient H2S capture. One such promising attempt employs variations in the operating conditions for a two-column setup: the first column at high temperature for absorption of CO2, and the second column at low temperature for removal of H2S without over-processing for CO2. (300) Adsorbents where aminopolymers are polymerized in situ on a porous support have not yet been tried for H2S capture, and this could constitute an important future investigation.
Ionic liquids are an emerging class of absorbents for selective acid gas removal; emphasis on understanding their structure and performance should remain the focus of fundamental investigations, and cost comparisons with commercial liquid solvents will help understand the true potential of these new liquids for sweetening applications. Deep eutectic solvents are another new class of absorbents; although these are explored only for CO2 capture as of today, future studies may investigate H2S removal using these solvents. In addition to the performance metrics of capacity and selectivity, operational aspects, such as lowering the viscosity and aquatic toxicity of these new classes of solvents, are also likely to play an important role in the development of these new technologies.
Mixed metal oxides for reactive H2S removal have evolved empirically in most cases, and very little is known in the literature about the fundamental mechanisms governing improved performance. Some progress has been shown in the ZnO and CuZnO mixed oxide sulfidation mechanisms using TEM and in situ synchrotron XRD. An even better understanding of these reaction mechanisms may assist in designing mixed oxides with not only a high degree of regenerability but also structural reversibility on regeneration. The latter is more important for a stable bed performance over the life of the adsorbent. Some of the MOFs investigated in the literature have shown very high H2S capacities. Knowledge of thermal conductivities and specific heats of these materials becomes essential in the design of adsorption beds involving high exothermicity. In case of cation-exchanged zeolites, structural characterization of metallic species to elucidate whether these are located at catalytic ion-exchange sites or just as extra-framework metal oxides should help in understanding the performance on more fundamental grounds. Most literature studies on utilizing solids for mass separation focus on designing sorbents with higher selectivities and capacities; emphasis should also be levied on factors such as structural and performance regenerability, stability in the presence of strongly adsorbing/reacting impurities, heats of adsorption, specific heat capacities, and thermal conductivities. Future adsorbent screening should try to incorporate these diverse properties in the selection criteria.
Significant development has occurred in the scientific and technological improvement of polymeric membranes for sour gas sweetening. Synthesis and performance studies of thin membranes made from some of the promising polymeric materials should be undertaken in order to asses the potential of these membranes for commercial application. There is only one report in the literature using zeolitic membranes for H2S separation; (398) the results from this study seem to be promising and should be explored further. Use of porous graphene and carbon molecular sieve membranes for H2S capture also constitute an area of future investigation in the field. Mixed-matrix membranes composed of MOFs dispersed in polymeric materials have been modeled using theory and simulations. Experimental and theoretical development of these next-generation membranes for gas sweetening will remain the research focus for the next decade or so.
Sulfur is mainly used in the production of sulfuric acid. Other uses of sulfur include manufacture of vulcanized rubber, building materials, inorganic chemicals, dyes, skin treatment ointments, matches, explosives, fertilizers, agrochemicals, fungicides, and fumigants. It is also useful in the bleaching of paper, extraction of minerals, and processing of wastewater. In recent years, increased processing of highly sour gas fields in the Middle East regions has resulted in a large surplus of sulfur, and research is being focused on developing new commercial applications of sulfur, such as battery materials and increased sulfur content of common plastics and building materials. Thus, the overall economics of highly sour gas wells may depend not only on the economics of acid gas removal but also on what one decides to do with the sulfur. Whether one can find high-value applications for sulfur, or store mountains of sulfur as inventory for future increase in demand, or maybe even re-inject the H2S gas into depleted wells are the different aspects that may influence the choice of an H2S-removal process. Detailed economic analysis of competing bulk H2S removal processes, such as polymeric membrane separations, cryogenic distillation, all-silica zeolitic adsorbents, and combinations thereof, may help researchers arrive at the commercially optimal solution.
