[1] "C3H6 selectivity over V(2.9)/SiO2 and V(2.7)/MCM-41 is very close. The selectivity is, however, influenced by oxidising agents (O2 and N2O) being higher with N2O than with O2."

[2] "This improving effect of N2O on propene selectivity is assumed to be due to the fact that catalyst reoxidation by N2O is less favourable than by O2 [9]. This causes a decrease in the steady-state concentration of active surface lattice oxygen of VOx species, i.e. the surface density of oxidising sites decreases."

[3] "Although direct experimental evidence is not available at this stage, it has been suggested that atomic oxygen species (O, O, O2) are responsible for selective oxidation, while polyatomic oxygen species (O2
2, O3
2) take part in COx formation [2224]."

[4] "The apparent TOFs (rates of propane consumption per vanadium atom) in the ODP reaction are a function of vanadium surface densities, supporting material and oxidising agent (O2 or N2O). TOFs with O2 are higher than those with N2O due to the lower ability of N2O for catalyst reoxidation."

N2O shows advantages in terms of propylene selectivity compared to O2 in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP). This is attributed to N2O's lower ability to reoxidize the catalyst, which results in a decreased concentration of active surface lattice oxygen species. This reduction in oxidizing site density favors selective oxidation to propylene over complete oxidation to COx.

The study examined various catalysts, including V/SiO2, V/MCM-41, and V/γ-Al2O3. The performance of these catalysts depends on factors such as vanadium surface density and the nature of the support material. Silica-based supports (SiO2 and MCM-41) showed better performance in stabilizing highly dispersed VOx species compared to γ-Al2O3.

The main challenge associated with N2O-ODHP appears to be the lower activity (turnover frequency) compared to O2-ODHP. This is due to N2O's reduced ability to reoxidize the catalyst. The study does not directly address catalyst deactivation or stability issues specific to N2O-ODHP.

To make N2O-ODHP more feasible, future research could focus on:

1. Developing catalysts that maintain high selectivity while improving activity with N2O.
2. Investigating the optimal balance between selectivity and activity by fine-tuning catalyst composition and structure.
3. Exploring mixed oxidant systems (e.g., N2O + O2) to combine the selectivity benefits of N2O with the higher activity of O2.
4. Studying the long-term stability of catalysts under N2O-ODHP conditions.
5. Investigating the economic and environmental implications of using N2O as an oxidant on an industrial scale.

These strategies could potentially address the activity limitations while maintaining the selectivity advantages of N2O-ODHP.

在丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）反应中，N2O在丙烯选择性方面比O2显示出优势。这归因于N2O重新氧化催化剂的能力较低，导致活性表面晶格氧物种的浓度降低。这种氧化位点密度的降低有利于选择性氧化生成丙烯，而不是完全氧化生成COx。

研究考察了各种催化剂，包括V/SiO2、V/MCM-41和V/γ-Al2O3。这些催化剂的性能取决于钒表面密度和载体材料的性质等因素。与γ-Al2O3相比，基于二氧化硅的载体（SiO2和MCM-41）在稳定高度分散的VOx物种方面表现更好。

N2O-ODHP的主要挑战似乎是与O2-ODHP相比，活性（转化频率）较低。这是由于N2O重新氧化催化剂的能力降低所致。该研究没有直接涉及N2O-ODHP特有的催化剂失活或稳定性问题。

为了使N2O-ODHP更具可行性，未来的研究可以集中在以下方面：

1. 开发在保持高选择性的同时提高N2O活性的催化剂。
2. 通过微调催化剂组成和结构，研究选择性和活性之间的最佳平衡。
3. 探索混合氧化剂系统（如N2O + O2），结合N2O的选择性优势和O2的高活性。
4. 研究催化剂在N2O-ODHP条件下的长期稳定性。
5. 研究在工业规模上使用N2O作为氧化剂的经济和环境影响。

这些策略可能有助于解决活性限制，同时保持N2O-ODHP的选择性优势。

[1] "C3H6 selectivity over all materials studied can be tuned by using an alternative oxidising agent (N2O). The improving effect of N2O on C3H6 selectivity is related to the lower ability of N2O for catalyst reoxidation resulting in an increase in the degree of catalyst reduction, i.e. spatial separation of active lattice oxygen in surface VOx species. Such separation favours selective oxidation over COx formation."

[2] "For comparing activity of various catalytic materials, apparent turnover frequencies (TOFs) for propane conversion were obtained from steady-state reaction rates determined under differential conditions. Attention is particularly focussed on the effect of different oxidising agents (O2 and N2O) on activity and selectivity of VOx species in the ODP reaction."

[3] "For a given vanadium surface density, the TOF values obtained with N2O as oxidant is lower than with O2. According to [9], the lower activity of N2O is explained by the lower ability of N2O for reoxidation of reduced VOx sites."

[4] "Besides the influence of the support material on catalytic performance of V-based catalysts in the ODP reaction, their catalytic performance can be further tuned by applying N2O instead of O2 as shown in Fig. 3.

The use of nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) offers several advantages in terms of propylene selectivity compared to other oxidants, particularly oxygen (O2). 

N2O improves propylene selectivity across all studied materials. This improvement is attributed to N2O's lower ability to reoxidize the catalyst, which leads to increased catalyst reduction and spatial separation of active lattice oxygen in surface VOx species. This separation favors selective oxidation over COx formation.

Various catalysts employed in this process include vanadium-based catalysts supported on different materials such as MCM-41, amorphous SiO2, and γ-Al2O3. The study particularly focused on VOx species with different degrees of polymerization and dispersion on these supports.

However, the use of N2O as an oxidant also presents challenges. The turnover frequency (TOF) values obtained with N2O are lower than those with O2, indicating lower activity. This lower activity is explained by N2O's reduced ability to reoxidize reduced VOx sites.

The critical challenges associated with catalyst deactivation and stability are not directly addressed in the given literature. However, the study of catalyst characterization and performance under different conditions provides insights that could be used to address these issues.

To make N2O-ODHP a more feasible option for practical implementation, several strategies or research directions could be proposed:

1. Optimization of catalyst composition and structure to enhance activity while maintaining high selectivity with N2O.
2. Investigation of mixed oxidant systems (e.g., N2O + O2) to balance activity and selectivity.
3. Development of more efficient N2O production methods to offset the lower activity.
4. Further study of the reaction mechanism with N2O to identify potential ways to mitigate catalyst deactivation.
5. Exploration of novel support materials that could enhance the stability and performance of VOx species with N2O.

These strategies aim to address the limitations of lower activity while capitalizing on the selectivity advantages of N2O in ODHP.

在氧化脱氢丙烷（ODHP）反应中使用一氧化二氮（N2O）作为氧化剂，与其他氧化剂相比，在丙烯选择性方面具有几个优势，特别是与氧气（O2）相比。

N2O提高了所有研究材料的丙烯选择性。这种改善归因于N2O重新氧化催化剂的能力较低，导致催化剂还原程度增加，表面VOx物种中活性晶格氧的空间分离。这种分离有利于选择性氧化而不是COx的形成。

这个过程中使用的各种催化剂包括负载在不同材料上的钒基催化剂，如MCM-41、无定形SiO2和γ-Al2O3。研究特别关注了这些载体上VOx物种的不同聚合度和分散度。

然而，使用N2O作为氧化剂也存在挑战。用N2O获得的转化频率（TOF）值低于O2，表明活性较低。这种较低的活性解释为N2O重新氧化还原的VOx位点的能力较弱。

给定的文献中没有直接讨论与催化剂失活和稳定性相关的关键挑战。但是，在不同条件下对催化剂表征和性能的研究提供了可用于解决这些问题的见解。

为了使N2O-ODHP成为更可行的实际应用选择，可以提出几种策略或研究方向：

1. 优化催化剂组成和结构，以提高N2O的活性，同时保持高选择性。
2. 研究混合氧化剂系统（如N2O + O2）以平衡活性和选择性。
3. 开发更高效的N2O生产方法，以抵消较低的活性。
4. 进一步研究N2O的反应机理，以确定可能的方法来减轻催化剂失活。
5. 探索新型载体材料，可能增强VOx物种与N2O的稳定性和性能。

这些策略旨在解决较低活性的限制，同时利用N2O在ODHP中的选择性优势。

[4] "The apparent TOFs (rates of propane consumption per vanadium atom) in the ODP reaction are a function of vanadium surface densities, supporting material and oxidising agent (O2 or N2O). TOFs with O2 are higher than those with N2O due to the lower ability of N2O for catalyst reoxidation."

The use of nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) offers several advantages in terms of propylene selectivity compared to other oxidants, particularly oxygen (O2). 

N2O improves propene selectivity due to its lower ability to reoxidize the catalyst compared to O2. This results in a decrease in the steady-state concentration of active surface lattice oxygen on the catalyst, which favors selective oxidation to propene over complete oxidation to COx products.

Various catalysts have been employed in the N2O-ODHP process, with vanadium-based catalysts being the primary focus of this study. The catalysts examined include V/SiO2, V/MCM-41, and V/g-Al2O3. The support material plays a crucial role in catalyst performance, with high-surface amorphous SiO2 and MCM-41 enabling better stabilization of highly dispersed surface VOx species compared to g-Al2O3.

While the study does not directly address critical challenges associated with catalyst deactivation and stability, it can be inferred that the lower reoxidation ability of N2O might lead to slower catalyst regeneration, potentially affecting long-term stability. Additionally, the lower activity (TOF) observed with N2O compared to O2 could be a challenge for practical implementation.

To address these limitations and make N2O-ODHP more feasible for practical implementation, several strategies could be pursued:

1. Catalyst optimization: Develop catalysts that balance the improved selectivity offered by N2O with higher activity and stability. This could involve exploring new support materials or modifying existing ones to enhance VOx species dispersion and stability.

2. Process engineering: Investigate optimal reaction conditions (temperature, pressure, gas composition) that maximize the benefits of N2O while minimizing its drawbacks.

3. Hybrid oxidant systems: Explore the use of N2O in combination with other oxidants to achieve a balance between selectivity and activity.

4. In-situ catalyst regeneration: Develop methods for efficient catalyst regeneration without compromising the selectivity benefits of N2O.

5. Economic and environmental assessment: Conduct comprehensive studies on the economic viability and environmental impact of N2O-ODHP compared to conventional processes to identify areas for improvement and potential advantages.

These research directions could help address the current limitations of N2O-ODHP and potentially make it a more attractive option for industrial implementation.

在丙烷氧化脱氢(ODHP)反应中使用一氧化二氮(N2O)作为氧化剂相比其他氧化剂在丙烯选择性方面具有几个优势，特别是与氧气(O2)相比。

N2O提高了丙烯选择性，这是因为与O2相比，N2O重新氧化催化剂的能力较弱。这导致催化剂表面活性晶格氧的稳态浓度降低，有利于选择性氧化生成丙烯，而不是完全氧化生成COx产物。

N2O-ODHP过程中使用了各种催化剂，其中以钒基催化剂为本研究的主要焦点。研究的催化剂包括V/SiO2、V/MCM-41和V/g-Al2O3。载体材料在催化剂性能中起着至关重要的作用，高比表面积的无定形SiO2和MCM-41能够比g-Al2O3更好地稳定高分散的表面VOx物种。

虽然该研究没有直接涉及催化剂失活和稳定性相关的关键挑战，但可以推断N2O较弱的重新氧化能力可能导致催化剂再生速度较慢，潜在影响长期稳定性。此外，与O2相比，N2O观察到的较低活性(TOF)可能是实际应用的一个挑战。

为了解决这些限制并使N2O-ODHP在实际应用中更可行，可以采取以下几种策略：

1. 催化剂优化：开发能够平衡N2O提供的改进选择性与更高活性和稳定性的催化剂。这可能涉及探索新的载体材料或修改现有材料以增强VOx物种的分散性和稳定性。

2. 工艺工程：研究最佳反应条件（温度、压力、气体组成），以最大化N2O的优势，同时最小化其缺点。

3. 混合氧化剂系统：探索将N2O与其他氧化剂结合使用，以在选择性和活性之间取得平衡。

4. 原位催化剂再生：开发高效的催化剂再生方法，同时不影响N2O的选择性优势。

5. 经济和环境评估：对比N2O-ODHP与传统工艺进行全面的经济可行性和环境影响研究，以确定需要改进的领域和潜在优势。

这些研究方向可能有助于解决N2O-ODHP目前的局限性，并有可能使其成为更具吸引力的工业应用选择。

The use of nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) offers significant advantages in terms of propylene selectivity compared to other oxidants, particularly oxygen (O2). The main advantage of using N2O is its ability to improve C3H6 (propylene) selectivity across various catalytic materials studied.

The improvement in propylene selectivity when using N2O is attributed to its lower ability to reoxidize the catalyst compared to O2. This results in an increased degree of catalyst reduction and a spatial separation of active lattice oxygen in surface VOx species. This separation favors selective oxidation to propylene over the formation of undesired COx products.

The study primarily focused on vanadia-based catalysts, including V/MCM-41, V/SiO2, and V/γ-Al2O3. These catalysts showed different performances depending on the support material and vanadium loading. The support material influenced the dispersion and structure of VOx species, which in turn affected catalyst performance.

However, the use of N2O as an oxidant also presents some challenges. The turnover frequency (TOF) values obtained with N2O as the oxidant were lower than those with O2, indicating lower overall activity. This lower activity is explained by N2O's reduced ability to reoxidize the reduced VOx sites on the catalyst surface.

The study does not directly address issues of catalyst deactivation and stability. However, it's worth noting that the oxidative dehydrogenation process generally suffers less from catalyst deactivation due to coking compared to non-oxidative dehydrogenation.

To make N2O-ODHP more feasible for practical implementation, future research directions could include:

1. Developing catalysts that maintain high selectivity while improving activity when using N2O as an oxidant.
2. Investigating the long-term stability of catalysts under N2O-ODHP conditions.
3. Exploring mixed oxidant systems (e.g., N2O + O2) to balance selectivity and activity.
4. Optimizing reactor designs to take advantage of N2O's unique properties as an oxidant.
5. Studying the economic and environmental impacts of using N2O in large-scale ODHP processes.

These strategies could help address the limitations of lower activity while maintaining the selectivity advantages of N2O-ODHP, potentially making it a more viable option for industrial application.

在丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）过程中使用一氧化二氮（N2O）作为氧化剂与其他氧化剂相比，在丙烯选择性方面具有显著优势，特别是与氧气（O2）相比。使用N2O的主要优势在于它能够提高所研究的各种催化材料的C3H6（丙烯）选择性。

使用N2O时丙烯选择性的提高归因于其相比O2而言重新氧化催化剂的能力较低。这导致催化剂还原程度增加，表面VOx物种中活性晶格氧的空间分离。这种分离有利于选择性氧化生成丙烯，而不是形成不需要的COx产物。

研究主要集中在钒基催化剂上，包括V/MCM-41、V/SiO2和V/γ-Al2O3。这些催化剂根据支撑材料和钒负载量的不同显示出不同的性能。支撑材料影响VOx物种的分散和结构，从而影响催化剂性能。

然而，使用N2O作为氧化剂也存在一些挑战。与O2相比，使用N2O作为氧化剂获得的转化频率（TOF）值较低，表明整体活性较低。这种较低的活性解释为N2O重新氧化催化剂表面还原的VOx位点的能力较弱。

该研究并未直接解决催化剂失活和稳定性问题。但值得注意的是，与非氧化脱氢相比，氧化脱氢过程通常受到积碳导致的催化剂失活影响较小。

为了使N2O-ODHP更适合实际应用，未来的研究方向可能包括：

1. 开发在使用N2O作为氧化剂时保持高选择性同时提高活性的催化剂。
2. 研究催化剂在N2O-ODHP条件下的长期稳定性。
