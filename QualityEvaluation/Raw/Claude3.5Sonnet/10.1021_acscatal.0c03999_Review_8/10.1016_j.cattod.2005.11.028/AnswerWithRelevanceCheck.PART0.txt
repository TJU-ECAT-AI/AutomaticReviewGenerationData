          "C3H6 selectivity over all materials studied can be tuned by using an alternative oxidising agent (N2O). The improving effect of N2O on C3H6 selectivity is related to the lower ability of N2O for catalyst reoxidation resulting in an increase in the degree of catalyst reduction, i.e. spatial separation of active lattice oxygen in surface VOx species. Such separation favours selective oxidation over COx formation."

"Besides the influence of the support material on catalytic performance of V-based catalysts in the ODP reaction, their catalytic performance can be further tuned by applying N2O instead of O2 as shown in Fig. 3. This improving effect of N2O on propene selectivity is assumed to be due to the fact that catalyst reoxidation by N2O is less favourable than by O2 [9]. This causes a decrease in the steady-state concentration of active surface lattice oxygen of VOx species, i.e. the surface density of oxidising sites decreases."

"The apparent TOFs (rates of propane consumption per vanadium atom) in the ODP reaction are a function of vanadium surface densities, supporting material and oxidising agent (O2 or N2O). TOFs with O2 are higher than those with N2O due to the lower ability of N2O for catalyst reoxidation."

"Although direct experimental evidence is not available at this stage, it has been suggested that atomic oxygen species (O, O, O2) are responsible for selective oxidation, while polyatomic oxygen species (O2
2, O3
2) take part in COx formation"

"High-surface amorphous SiO2 and MCM-41 enable stabilisation of highly dispersed surface VOx species at vanadium loading up to 5 wt.% as compared to only up to 1 wt.% on g-Al2O3. This is due to lower specific surface area of g-Al2O3."

          Nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) offers significant advantages in terms of propylene selectivity compared to oxygen (O2). The main advantages include:

1. Improved C3H6 selectivity: N2O enhances propylene selectivity across all studied materials due to its lower ability to reoxidize the catalyst.

2. Increased catalyst reduction: This results in spatial separation of active lattice oxygen in surface VOx species, favoring selective oxidation over COx formation.

3. Lower oxidizing site density: N2O causes a decrease in the steady-state concentration of active surface lattice oxygen, reducing the surface density of oxidizing sites.

Various catalysts have been employed in this process, primarily vanadium-based catalysts supported on different materials such as MCM-41, amorphous SiO2, and γ-Al2O3. High-surface amorphous SiO2 and MCM-41 enable better stabilization of highly dispersed surface VOx species compared to γ-Al2O3.

However, the use of N2O also presents challenges:

1. Lower activity: Turnover frequency (TOF) values with N2O are lower than those with O2 due to N2O's reduced ability to reoxidize the catalyst.

2. Potential long-term stability issues: While not directly addressed in the study, the lower reoxidation ability of N2O might affect catalyst regeneration and long-term stability.

To make N2O-ODHP more feasible for practical implementation, several strategies could be pursued:

1. Catalyst optimization: Develop catalysts that balance improved selectivity with higher activity and stability.
2. Process engineering: Investigate optimal reaction conditions to maximize N2O benefits while minimizing drawbacks.
3. Hybrid oxidant systems: Explore combinations of N2O with other oxidants to achieve a balance between selectivity and activity.
4. In-situ catalyst regeneration: Develop efficient methods for catalyst regeneration without compromising N2O's selectivity benefits.
5. Economic and environmental assessment: Conduct comprehensive studies on the viability and environmental impact of N2O-ODHP compared to conventional processes.

These research directions could help address the current limitations of N2O-ODHP and potentially make it a more attractive option for industrial implementation.

          在氧化脱氢丙烷（ODHP）反应中使用一氧化二氮（N2O）作为氧化剂相比氧气（O2）在丙烯选择性方面具有显著优势。主要优势包括：

1. 提高C3H6选择性：N2O由于重新氧化催化剂的能力较弱，因此在所有研究材料中都提高了丙烯选择性。

2. 增加催化剂还原程度：这导致表面VOx物种中活性晶格氧的空间分离，有利于选择性氧化而不是COx的形成。

3. 降低氧化位点密度：N2O导致活性表面晶格氧的稳态浓度降低，减少了氧化位点的表面密度。

这个过程中使用了各种催化剂，主要是负载在不同材料上的钒基催化剂，如MCM-41、无定形SiO2和γ-Al2O3。高比表面积的无定形SiO2和MCM-41与γ-Al2O3相比能够更好地稳定高度分散的表面VOx物种。

然而，使用N2O也存在挑战：

1. 活性较低：由于N2O重新氧化催化剂的能力较弱，使用N2O的转化频率（TOF）值低于使用O2的值。

2. 潜在的长期稳定性问题：虽然研究中没有直接涉及，但N2O较弱的重新氧化能力可能会影响催化剂再生和长期稳定性。

为了使N2O-ODHP在实际应用中更可行，可以采取以下几种策略：

1. 催化剂优化：开发能够平衡提高选择性与更高活性和稳定性的催化剂。
2. 工艺工程：研究最佳反应条件，以最大化N2O的优势，同时最小化其缺点。
3. 混合氧化剂系统：探索将N2O与其他氧化剂结合使用，以在选择性和活性之间取得平衡。
4. 原位催化剂再生：开发高效的催化剂再生方法，同时不影响N2O的选择性优势。
5. 经济和环境评估：对比常规工艺，对N2O-ODHP的可行性和环境影响进行全面研究。

这些研究方向可能有助于解决N2O-ODHP目前的局限性，并有可能使其成为更具吸引力的工业应用选择。
