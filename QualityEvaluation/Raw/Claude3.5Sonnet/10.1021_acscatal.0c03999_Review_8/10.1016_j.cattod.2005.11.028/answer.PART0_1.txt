[1] "C3H6 selectivity over all materials studied can be tuned by using an alternative oxidising agent (N2O). The improving effect of N2O on C3H6 selectivity is related to the lower ability of N2O for catalyst reoxidation resulting in an increase in the degree of catalyst reduction, i.e. spatial separation of active lattice oxygen in surface VOx species. Such separation favours selective oxidation over COx formation."

[2] "For comparing activity of various catalytic materials, apparent turnover frequencies (TOFs) for propane conversion were obtained from steady-state reaction rates determined under differential conditions. Attention is particularly focussed on the effect of different oxidising agents (O2 and N2O) on activity and selectivity of VOx species in the ODP reaction."

[3] "For a given vanadium surface density, the TOF values obtained with N2O as oxidant is lower than with O2. According to [9], the lower activity of N2O is explained by the lower ability of N2O for reoxidation of reduced VOx sites."

[4] "Besides the influence of the support material on catalytic performance of V-based catalysts in the ODP reaction, their catalytic performance can be further tuned by applying N2O instead of O2 as shown in Fig. 3. This improving effect of N2O on propene selectivity is assumed to be due to the fact that catalyst reoxidation by N2O is less favourable than by O2 [9]."

The use of nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) offers several advantages in terms of propylene selectivity compared to other oxidants, particularly oxygen (O2). 

N2O improves propylene selectivity across all studied materials. This improvement is attributed to N2O's lower ability to reoxidize the catalyst, which leads to increased catalyst reduction and spatial separation of active lattice oxygen in surface VOx species. This separation favors selective oxidation over COx formation.

Various catalysts employed in this process include vanadium-based catalysts supported on different materials such as MCM-41, amorphous SiO2, and γ-Al2O3. The study particularly focused on VOx species with different degrees of polymerization and dispersion on these supports.

However, the use of N2O as an oxidant also presents challenges. The turnover frequency (TOF) values obtained with N2O are lower than those with O2, indicating lower activity. This lower activity is explained by N2O's reduced ability to reoxidize reduced VOx sites.

The critical challenges associated with catalyst deactivation and stability are not directly addressed in the given literature. However, the study of catalyst characterization and performance under different conditions provides insights that could be used to address these issues.

To make N2O-ODHP a more feasible option for practical implementation, several strategies or research directions could be proposed:

1. Optimization of catalyst composition and structure to enhance activity while maintaining high selectivity with N2O.
2. Investigation of mixed oxidant systems (e.g., N2O + O2) to balance activity and selectivity.
3. Development of more efficient N2O production methods to offset the lower activity.
4. Further study of the reaction mechanism with N2O to identify potential ways to mitigate catalyst deactivation.
5. Exploration of novel support materials that could enhance the stability and performance of VOx species with N2O.

These strategies aim to address the limitations of lower activity while capitalizing on the selectivity advantages of N2O in ODHP.

在氧化脱氢丙烷（ODHP）反应中使用一氧化二氮（N2O）作为氧化剂，与其他氧化剂相比，在丙烯选择性方面具有几个优势，特别是与氧气（O2）相比。

N2O提高了所有研究材料的丙烯选择性。这种改善归因于N2O重新氧化催化剂的能力较低，导致催化剂还原程度增加，表面VOx物种中活性晶格氧的空间分离。这种分离有利于选择性氧化而不是COx的形成。

这个过程中使用的各种催化剂包括负载在不同材料上的钒基催化剂，如MCM-41、无定形SiO2和γ-Al2O3。研究特别关注了这些载体上VOx物种的不同聚合度和分散度。

然而，使用N2O作为氧化剂也存在挑战。用N2O获得的转化频率（TOF）值低于O2，表明活性较低。这种较低的活性解释为N2O重新氧化还原的VOx位点的能力较弱。

给定的文献中没有直接讨论与催化剂失活和稳定性相关的关键挑战。但是，在不同条件下对催化剂表征和性能的研究提供了可用于解决这些问题的见解。

为了使N2O-ODHP成为更可行的实际应用选择，可以提出几种策略或研究方向：

1. 优化催化剂组成和结构，以提高N2O的活性，同时保持高选择性。
2. 研究混合氧化剂系统（如N2O + O2）以平衡活性和选择性。
3. 开发更高效的N2O生产方法，以抵消较低的活性。
4. 进一步研究N2O的反应机理，以确定可能的方法来减轻催化剂失活。
5. 探索新型载体材料，可能增强VOx物种与N2O的稳定性和性能。

这些策略旨在解决较低活性的限制，同时利用N2O在ODHP中的选择性优势。
