[1] "C3H6 selectivity over V(2.9)/SiO2 and V(2.7)/MCM-41 is very close. The selectivity is, however, influenced by oxidising agents (O2 and N2O) being higher with N2O than with O2."

[2] "Besides the influence of the support material on catalytic performance of V-based catalysts in the ODP reaction, their catalytic performance can be further tuned by applying N2O instead of O2 as shown in Fig. 3. This improving effect of N2O on propene selectivity is assumed to be due to the fact that catalyst reoxidation by N2O is less favourable than by O2 [9]. This causes a decrease in the steady-state concentration of active surface lattice oxygen of VOx species, i.e. the surface density of oxidising sites decreases."

[3] "High-surface amorphous SiO2 and MCM-41 enable stabilisation of highly dispersed surface VOx species at vanadium loading up to 5 wt.% as compared to only up to 1 wt.% on g-Al2O3. This is due to lower specific surface area of g-Al2O3."

[4] "The apparent TOFs (rates of propane consumption per vanadium atom) in the ODP reaction are a function of vanadium surface densities, supporting material and oxidising agent (O2 or N2O). TOFs with O2 are higher than those with N2O due to the lower ability of N2O for catalyst reoxidation."

The use of nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) offers several advantages in terms of propylene selectivity compared to other oxidants, particularly oxygen (O2). 

N2O improves propene selectivity due to its lower ability to reoxidize the catalyst compared to O2. This results in a decrease in the steady-state concentration of active surface lattice oxygen on the catalyst, which favors selective oxidation to propene over complete oxidation to COx products.

Various catalysts have been employed in the N2O-ODHP process, with vanadium-based catalysts being the primary focus of this study. The catalysts examined include V/SiO2, V/MCM-41, and V/g-Al2O3. The support material plays a crucial role in catalyst performance, with high-surface amorphous SiO2 and MCM-41 enabling better stabilization of highly dispersed surface VOx species compared to g-Al2O3.

While the study does not directly address critical challenges associated with catalyst deactivation and stability, it can be inferred that the lower reoxidation ability of N2O might lead to slower catalyst regeneration, potentially affecting long-term stability. Additionally, the lower activity (TOF) observed with N2O compared to O2 could be a challenge for practical implementation.

To address these limitations and make N2O-ODHP more feasible for practical implementation, several strategies could be pursued:

1. Catalyst optimization: Develop catalysts that balance the improved selectivity offered by N2O with higher activity and stability. This could involve exploring new support materials or modifying existing ones to enhance VOx species dispersion and stability.

2. Process engineering: Investigate optimal reaction conditions (temperature, pressure, gas composition) that maximize the benefits of N2O while minimizing its drawbacks.

3. Hybrid oxidant systems: Explore the use of N2O in combination with other oxidants to achieve a balance between selectivity and activity.

4. In-situ catalyst regeneration: Develop methods for efficient catalyst regeneration without compromising the selectivity benefits of N2O.

5. Economic and environmental assessment: Conduct comprehensive studies on the economic viability and environmental impact of N2O-ODHP compared to conventional processes to identify areas for improvement and potential advantages.

These research directions could help address the current limitations of N2O-ODHP and potentially make it a more attractive option for industrial implementation.

在丙烷氧化脱氢(ODHP)反应中使用一氧化二氮(N2O)作为氧化剂相比其他氧化剂在丙烯选择性方面具有几个优势，特别是与氧气(O2)相比。

N2O提高了丙烯选择性，这是因为与O2相比，N2O重新氧化催化剂的能力较弱。这导致催化剂表面活性晶格氧的稳态浓度降低，有利于选择性氧化生成丙烯，而不是完全氧化生成COx产物。

N2O-ODHP过程中使用了各种催化剂，其中以钒基催化剂为本研究的主要焦点。研究的催化剂包括V/SiO2、V/MCM-41和V/g-Al2O3。载体材料在催化剂性能中起着至关重要的作用，高比表面积的无定形SiO2和MCM-41能够比g-Al2O3更好地稳定高分散的表面VOx物种。

虽然该研究没有直接涉及催化剂失活和稳定性相关的关键挑战，但可以推断N2O较弱的重新氧化能力可能导致催化剂再生速度较慢，潜在影响长期稳定性。此外，与O2相比，N2O观察到的较低活性(TOF)可能是实际应用的一个挑战。

为了解决这些限制并使N2O-ODHP在实际应用中更可行，可以采取以下几种策略：

1. 催化剂优化：开发能够平衡N2O提供的改进选择性与更高活性和稳定性的催化剂。这可能涉及探索新的载体材料或修改现有材料以增强VOx物种的分散性和稳定性。

2. 工艺工程：研究最佳反应条件（温度、压力、气体组成），以最大化N2O的优势，同时最小化其缺点。

3. 混合氧化剂系统：探索将N2O与其他氧化剂结合使用，以在选择性和活性之间取得平衡。

4. 原位催化剂再生：开发高效的催化剂再生方法，同时不影响N2O的选择性优势。

5. 经济和环境评估：对比N2O-ODHP与传统工艺进行全面的经济可行性和环境影响研究，以确定需要改进的领域和潜在优势。

这些研究方向可能有助于解决N2O-ODHP目前的局限性，并有可能使其成为更具吸引力的工业应用选择。
