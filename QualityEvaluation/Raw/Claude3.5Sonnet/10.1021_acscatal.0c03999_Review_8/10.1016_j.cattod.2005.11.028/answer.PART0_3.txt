[1] "Additionally, C3H6 selectivity over all materials studied can be tuned by using an alternative oxidising agent (N2O). The improving effect of N2O on C3H6 selectivity is related to the lower ability of N2O for catalyst reoxidation resulting in an increase in the degree of catalyst reduction, i.e. spatial separation of active lattice oxygen in surface VOx species. Such separation favours selective oxidation over COx formation."

[2] "For comparing activity of various catalytic materials, apparent turnover frequencies (TOFs) for propane conversion were obtained from steady-state reaction rates determined under differential conditions. Attention is particularly focussed on the effect of different oxidising agents (O2 and N2O) on activity and selectivity of VOx species in the ODP reaction."

[3] "For a given vanadium surface density, the TOF values obtained with N2O as oxidant is lower than with O2. According to [9], the lower activity of N2O is explained by the lower ability of N2O for reoxidation of reduced VOx sites."

[4] "Besides the influence of the support material on catalytic performance of V-based catalysts in the ODP reaction, their catalytic performance can be further tuned by applying N2O instead of O2 as shown in Fig. 3. This improving effect of N2O on propene selectivity is assumed to be due to the fact that catalyst reoxidation by N2O is less favourable than by O2 [9]. This causes a decrease in the steady-state concentration of active surface lattice oxygen of VOx species, i.e. the surface density of oxidising sites decreases."

The use of nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) offers significant advantages in terms of propylene selectivity compared to other oxidants, particularly oxygen (O2). The main advantage of using N2O is its ability to improve C3H6 (propylene) selectivity across various catalytic materials studied.

The improvement in propylene selectivity when using N2O is attributed to its lower ability to reoxidize the catalyst compared to O2. This results in an increased degree of catalyst reduction and a spatial separation of active lattice oxygen in surface VOx species. This separation favors selective oxidation to propylene over the formation of undesired COx products.

The study primarily focused on vanadia-based catalysts, including V/MCM-41, V/SiO2, and V/γ-Al2O3. These catalysts showed different performances depending on the support material and vanadium loading. The support material influenced the dispersion and structure of VOx species, which in turn affected catalyst performance.

However, the use of N2O as an oxidant also presents some challenges. The turnover frequency (TOF) values obtained with N2O as the oxidant were lower than those with O2, indicating lower overall activity. This lower activity is explained by N2O's reduced ability to reoxidize the reduced VOx sites on the catalyst surface.

The study does not directly address issues of catalyst deactivation and stability. However, it's worth noting that the oxidative dehydrogenation process generally suffers less from catalyst deactivation due to coking compared to non-oxidative dehydrogenation.

To make N2O-ODHP more feasible for practical implementation, future research directions could include:

1. Developing catalysts that maintain high selectivity while improving activity when using N2O as an oxidant.
2. Investigating the long-term stability of catalysts under N2O-ODHP conditions.
3. Exploring mixed oxidant systems (e.g., N2O + O2) to balance selectivity and activity.
4. Optimizing reactor designs to take advantage of N2O's unique properties as an oxidant.
5. Studying the economic and environmental impacts of using N2O in large-scale ODHP processes.

These strategies could help address the limitations of lower activity while maintaining the selectivity advantages of N2O-ODHP, potentially making it a more viable option for industrial application.

在丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）过程中使用一氧化二氮（N2O）作为氧化剂与其他氧化剂相比，在丙烯选择性方面具有显著优势，特别是与氧气（O2）相比。使用N2O的主要优势在于它能够提高所研究的各种催化材料的C3H6（丙烯）选择性。

使用N2O时丙烯选择性的提高归因于其相比O2而言重新氧化催化剂的能力较低。这导致催化剂还原程度增加，表面VOx物种中活性晶格氧的空间分离。这种分离有利于选择性氧化生成丙烯，而不是形成不需要的COx产物。

研究主要集中在钒基催化剂上，包括V/MCM-41、V/SiO2和V/γ-Al2O3。这些催化剂根据支撑材料和钒负载量的不同显示出不同的性能。支撑材料影响VOx物种的分散和结构，从而影响催化剂性能。

然而，使用N2O作为氧化剂也存在一些挑战。与O2相比，使用N2O作为氧化剂获得的转化频率（TOF）值较低，表明整体活性较低。这种较低的活性解释为N2O重新氧化催化剂表面还原的VOx位点的能力较弱。

该研究并未直接解决催化剂失活和稳定性问题。但值得注意的是，与非氧化脱氢相比，氧化脱氢过程通常受到积碳导致的催化剂失活影响较小。

为了使N2O-ODHP更适合实际应用，未来的研究方向可能包括：

1. 开发在使用N2O作为氧化剂时保持高选择性同时提高活性的催化剂。
2. 研究催化剂在N2O-ODHP条件下的长期稳定性。
3. 探索混合氧化剂系统（如N2O + O2）以平衡选择性和活性。
4. 优化反应器设计，以充分利用N2O作为氧化剂的独特性质。
5. 研究在大规模ODHP过程中使用N2O的经济和环境影响。

这些策略可能有助于解决活性较低的限制，同时保持N2O-ODHP的选择性优势，potentially making it a more viable option for industrial application.
