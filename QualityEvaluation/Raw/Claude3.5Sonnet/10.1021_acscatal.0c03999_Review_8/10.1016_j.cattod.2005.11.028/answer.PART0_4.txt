[1] "C3H6 selectivity over all materials studied can be tuned by using an alternative oxidising agent (N2O). The improving effect of N2O on C3H6 selectivity is related to the lower ability of N2O for catalyst reoxidation resulting in an increase in the degree of catalyst reduction, i.e. spatial separation of active lattice oxygen in surface VOx species."

[2] "For comparing activity of various catalytic materials, apparent turnover frequencies (TOFs) for propane conversion were obtained from steady-state reaction rates determined under differential conditions."

[3] "For a given vanadium surface density, the TOF values obtained with N2O as oxidant is lower than with O2. According to [9], the lower activity of N2O is explained by the lower ability of N2O for reoxidation of reduced VOx sites."

[4] "Besides the influence of the support material on catalytic performance of V-based catalysts in the ODP reaction, their catalytic performance can be further tuned by applying N2O instead of O2 as shown in Fig. 3."

[5] "Although direct experimental evidence is not available at this stage, it has been suggested that atomic oxygen species (O, O, O2) are responsible for selective oxidation, while polyatomic oxygen species (O2
2, O3
2) take part in COx formation"

The use of nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) offers several advantages in terms of propylene selectivity compared to other oxidants, particularly oxygen (O2).

N2O improves C3H6 (propylene) selectivity across all studied materials. This improvement is attributed to N2O's lower ability to reoxidize the catalyst, which results in an increased degree of catalyst reduction. This leads to a spatial separation of active lattice oxygen in surface VOx species, which favors selective oxidation over COx formation.

Various catalysts employed in this process include vanadia-based catalysts supported on different materials such as MCM-41, amorphous SiO2, and γ-Al2O3. The study focuses on the effect of support material and vanadium loading on catalyst performance.

The critical challenges associated with N2O-ODHP include lower catalytic activity compared to O2-ODHP. The turnover frequency (TOF) values obtained with N2O as an oxidant are lower than those with O2, due to N2O's reduced ability to reoxidize reduced VOx sites.

To address these limitations and make N2O-ODHP more feasible for practical implementation, several strategies or research directions could be proposed:

1. Catalyst optimization: Develop catalysts that can maintain high selectivity while improving activity with N2O. This could involve exploring new support materials or modifying existing ones to enhance N2O activation.

2. Mechanistic studies: Conduct more in-depth research to understand the exact mechanism of N2O-mediated selective oxidation. This could help in designing more effective catalysts.

3. Hybrid systems: Investigate the possibility of using a combination of N2O and O2 as oxidants to balance selectivity and activity.

4. Process engineering: Optimize reaction conditions (temperature, pressure, flow rates) to maximize the benefits of N2O while minimizing its drawbacks.

5. Economic and environmental assessment: Conduct comprehensive studies on the economic viability and environmental impact of N2O-ODHP compared to conventional processes.

By addressing these challenges and pursuing these research directions, N2O-ODHP could potentially become a more attractive option for industrial propylene production.

在氧化脱氢丙烷（ODHP）过程中使用一氧化二氮（N2O）作为氧化剂相比其他氧化剂在丙烯选择性方面提供了几个优势，特别是与氧气（O2）相比。

N2O提高了所有研究材料的C3H6（丙烯）选择性。这种改进归因于N2O重新氧化催化剂的能力较低，导致催化剂还原度增加。这导致表面VOx物种中活性晶格氧的空间分离，有利于选择性氧化而不是COx的形成。

这个过程中使用的各种催化剂包括负载在不同材料上的钒基催化剂，如MCM-41、无定形SiO2和γ-Al2O3。研究重点关注了支撑材料和钒负载量对催化剂性能的影响。

N2O-ODHP相关的关键挑战包括与O2-ODHP相比较低的催化活性。使用N2O作为氧化剂获得的转化频率（TOF）值低于O2，这是由于N2O重新氧化还原态VOx位点的能力较低。

为了解决这些限制并使N2O-ODHP更适合实际应用，可以提出几种策略或研究方向：

1. 催化剂优化：开发能够在使用N2O时保持高选择性同时提高活性的催化剂。这可能涉及探索新的支撑材料或修改现有材料以增强N2O的活化。

2. 机理研究：进行更深入的研究以理解N2O介导的选择性氧化的确切机理。这可以帮助设计更有效的催化剂。

3. 混合系统：研究使用N2O和O2组合作为氧化剂的可能性，以平衡选择性和活性。

4. 过程工程：优化反应条件（温度、压力、流速）以最大化N2O的优势，同时最小化其缺点。

5. 经济和环境评估：对比常规工艺，对N2O-ODHP的经济可行性和环境影响进行全面研究。

通过解决这些挑战并追求这些研究方向，N2O-ODHP可能成为工业丙烯生产的更具吸引力的选择。
