[1] "C3H6 selectivity over V(2.9)/SiO2 and V(2.7)/MCM-41 is very close. The selectivity is, however, influenced by oxidising agents (O2 and N2O) being higher with N2O than with O2."

[2] "This improving effect of N2O on propene selectivity is assumed to be due to the fact that catalyst reoxidation by N2O is less favourable than by O2 [9]. This causes a decrease in the steady-state concentration of active surface lattice oxygen of VOx species, i.e. the surface density of oxidising sites decreases."

[3] "Although direct experimental evidence is not available at this stage, it has been suggested that atomic oxygen species (O, O, O2) are responsible for selective oxidation, while polyatomic oxygen species (O2
2, O3
2) take part in COx formation [2224]."

[4] "The apparent TOFs (rates of propane consumption per vanadium atom) in the ODP reaction are a function of vanadium surface densities, supporting material and oxidising agent (O2 or N2O). TOFs with O2 are higher than those with N2O due to the lower ability of N2O for catalyst reoxidation."

N2O shows advantages in terms of propylene selectivity compared to O2 in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP). This is attributed to N2O's lower ability to reoxidize the catalyst, which results in a decreased concentration of active surface lattice oxygen species. This reduction in oxidizing site density favors selective oxidation to propylene over complete oxidation to COx.

The study examined various catalysts, including V/SiO2, V/MCM-41, and V/γ-Al2O3. The performance of these catalysts depends on factors such as vanadium surface density and the nature of the support material. Silica-based supports (SiO2 and MCM-41) showed better performance in stabilizing highly dispersed VOx species compared to γ-Al2O3.

The main challenge associated with N2O-ODHP appears to be the lower activity (turnover frequency) compared to O2-ODHP. This is due to N2O's reduced ability to reoxidize the catalyst. The study does not directly address catalyst deactivation or stability issues specific to N2O-ODHP.

To make N2O-ODHP more feasible, future research could focus on:

1. Developing catalysts that maintain high selectivity while improving activity with N2O.
2. Investigating the optimal balance between selectivity and activity by fine-tuning catalyst composition and structure.
3. Exploring mixed oxidant systems (e.g., N2O + O2) to combine the selectivity benefits of N2O with the higher activity of O2.
4. Studying the long-term stability of catalysts under N2O-ODHP conditions.
5. Investigating the economic and environmental implications of using N2O as an oxidant on an industrial scale.

These strategies could potentially address the activity limitations while maintaining the selectivity advantages of N2O-ODHP.

在丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）反应中，N2O在丙烯选择性方面比O2显示出优势。这归因于N2O重新氧化催化剂的能力较低，导致活性表面晶格氧物种的浓度降低。这种氧化位点密度的降低有利于选择性氧化生成丙烯，而不是完全氧化生成COx。

研究考察了各种催化剂，包括V/SiO2、V/MCM-41和V/γ-Al2O3。这些催化剂的性能取决于钒表面密度和载体材料的性质等因素。与γ-Al2O3相比，基于二氧化硅的载体（SiO2和MCM-41）在稳定高度分散的VOx物种方面表现更好。

N2O-ODHP的主要挑战似乎是与O2-ODHP相比，活性（转化频率）较低。这是由于N2O重新氧化催化剂的能力降低所致。该研究没有直接涉及N2O-ODHP特有的催化剂失活或稳定性问题。

为了使N2O-ODHP更具可行性，未来的研究可以集中在以下方面：

1. 开发在保持高选择性的同时提高N2O活性的催化剂。
2. 通过微调催化剂组成和结构，研究选择性和活性之间的最佳平衡。
3. 探索混合氧化剂系统（如N2O + O2），结合N2O的选择性优势和O2的高活性。
4. 研究催化剂在N2O-ODHP条件下的长期稳定性。
5. 研究在工业规模上使用N2O作为氧化剂的经济和环境影响。

这些策略可能有助于解决活性限制，同时保持N2O-ODHP的选择性优势。
