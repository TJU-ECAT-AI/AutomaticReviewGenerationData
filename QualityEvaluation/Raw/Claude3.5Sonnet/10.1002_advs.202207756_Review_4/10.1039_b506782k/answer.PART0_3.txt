[1] "On the contrary, Ga1 adsorbs ethane much more weakly and dissociative ethane adsorption was only found upon heating to 523 K. In this case ethane dissociation proceeds via oxidative addition to Ga1 ions, giving ethyl and hydride fragments coordinating to Ga31 species."

[2] "ZO  Ga1  C2H6 - ZO  [Ga31(H)(C2H5)]1"

[3] "Further heating in vacuum leads to the dissociation of the ethyl fragment into ethylene and gallium hydride species."

[5] "The only product observed during ethane conversion over Ga/ZSM-5 is ethylene."

The alkyl mechanism for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) on gallium-based catalysts can be inferred from the ethane activation mechanism described in the text, with some extrapolation to propane:

1. Initial activation: Propane is weakly adsorbed on Ga1 sites at low temperatures. Upon heating (around 523 K for ethane), propane undergoes dissociative adsorption via oxidative addition to Ga1 ions.

2. Formation of alkyl and hydride species: This dissociation results in the formation of a propyl fragment and a hydride, both coordinated to a Ga31 species.

3. β-hydride elimination: The propyl fragment undergoes β-hydride elimination, leading to the formation of propene and a second Ga-H bond.

4. Product desorption: Propene desorbs from the catalyst surface.

5. Catalyst regeneration: The gallium dihydride species releases H2, regenerating the active Ga1 site.

The key difference between the alkyl mechanism and the carbenium mechanism is the nature of the intermediate species. In the alkyl mechanism, a covalently bonded alkyl-metal species is formed, while the carbenium mechanism involves the formation of a carbocation intermediate.

The C-H activation step is likely proposed as the rate-determining step (RDS) because it involves breaking a strong C-H bond and requires significant activation energy. This is supported by the observation that dissociative adsorption only occurs at elevated temperatures.

The alkyl mechanism applies to different Ga species structures, particularly focusing on isolated Ga1 ions. The text doesn't provide information on how this mechanism might vary with different Ga structures, but it's reasonable to assume that the basic steps would remain similar, with possible variations in reactivity or selectivity depending on the specific Ga species present.

镓基催化剂上丙烷脱氢(PDH)反应的烷基机理可以从文中描述的乙烷活化机理推断出来，并稍加推广到丙烷：

1. 初始活化：丙烷在低温下被弱吸附在Ga1位点上。在加热时（乙烷约为523 K），丙烷通过氧化加成到Ga1离子上进行解离吸附。

2. 形成烷基和氢化物物种：这种解离导致形成丙基片段和氢化物，两者都与Ga31物种配位。

3. β-氢消除：丙基片段经历β-氢消除，生成丙烯和第二个Ga-H键。

4. 产物脱附：丙烯从催化剂表面脱附。

5. 催化剂再生：镓二氢化物物种释放H2，重新生成活性Ga1位点。

烷基机理和碳正离子机理的主要区别在于中间体物种的性质。在烷基机理中，形成共价键合的烷基-金属物种，而碳正离子机理涉及碳正离子中间体的形成。

C-H活化步骤可能被提出为速率决定步骤(RDS)，因为它涉及断裂强C-H键，需要显著的活化能。这一点由解离吸附仅在高温下发生的观察结果支持。

烷基机理适用于不同的Ga物种结构，特别是针对孤立的Ga1离子。文中没有提供关于这种机理如何随不同Ga结构而变化的信息，但可以合理地假设基本步骤保持相似，根据存在的特定Ga物种，反应性或选择性可能会有所不同。
