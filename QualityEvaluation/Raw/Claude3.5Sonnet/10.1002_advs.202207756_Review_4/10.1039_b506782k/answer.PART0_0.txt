[1] "On the contrary, Ga1 adsorbs ethane much more weakly and dissociative ethane adsorption was only found upon heating to 523 K. In this case ethane dissociation proceeds via oxidative addition to Ga1 ions, giving ethyl and hydride fragments coordinating to Ga31 species."

[2] "ZO  Ga1  C2H6 - ZO  [Ga31(H)(C2H5)]1"

[3] "ZO[Ga31(H)(C2H5)]1 - ZO[Ga31(H)2]1  C2H4"

[4] "Ga/ZSM-5 shows a stable activity as a function of the reaction time. Moreover, the catalyst remains white after reaction, indicative of the absence of large amounts of coke formation."

[5] "The only product observed during ethane conversion over Ga/ZSM-5 is ethylene. The further conversion of ethylene to oligomers or aromatics is impeded by the absence of Brnsted acidity in reduced Ga/ZSM-5, although one should also take into account the relatively low conversion."

The alkyl mechanism for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) on gallium-based catalysts involves several key steps:

1. Weak adsorption of propane on Ga+ sites at elevated temperatures.
2. Oxidative addition of propane to Ga+ ions, forming propyl and hydride fragments coordinated to Ga3+ species.
3. Decomposition of the propyl fragment into propylene and gallium hydride species.
4. Desorption of propylene as the product.
5. Regeneration of the Ga+ active site through desorption of hydrogen.

This mechanism differs from the carbenium mechanism, which involves the formation of carbocations as intermediates. The alkyl mechanism does not generate Brønsted acid sites or carbocations, leading to more stable and selective dehydrogenation.

The C-H activation step is likely proposed as the rate-determining step (RDS) because it involves breaking a strong C-H bond and requires significant energy input. This step determines the overall reaction rate and is typically the most difficult to overcome energetically.

The alkyl mechanism applies to different Ga species structures, such as isolated Ga+ ions or small Ga clusters. The key aspect is the ability of Ga species to undergo oxidative addition and facilitate C-H bond activation without generating strong acid sites. This mechanism explains the high selectivity towards olefins and the absence of significant side reactions or coke formation observed with Ga-based catalysts.

The stable activity, low coke formation, and high selectivity to ethylene (in the case of ethane dehydrogenation) support the proposed alkyl mechanism for Ga-based catalysts. The absence of Brønsted acidity in reduced Ga/ZSM-5 further confirms the distinct nature of this mechanism compared to traditional acid-catalyzed processes.

镓基催化剂上丙烷脱氢(PDH)的烷基机理涉及几个关键步骤：

1. 在高温下丙烷在Ga+位点上的弱吸附。
2. 丙烷对Ga+离子的氧化加成，形成与Ga3+物种配位的丙基和氢化物片段。
3. 丙基片段分解为丙烯和镓氢化物。
4. 丙烯作为产物脱附。
5. 通过氢气脱附再生Ga+活性位点。

这种机理与碳正离子机理不同，后者涉及碳正离子中间体的形成。烷基机理不会产生Brønsted酸位或碳正离子，从而导致更稳定和选择性的脱氢。

C-H活化步骤很可能被提出为速率决定步骤(RDS)，因为它涉及断裂强C-H键，需要大量能量输入。这一步骤决定了整体反应速率，通常是能量上最难克服的。

烷基机理适用于不同的Ga物种结构，如孤立的Ga+离子或小的Ga簇。关键在于Ga物种进行氧化加成和促进C-H键活化的能力，而不产生强酸位。这种机理解释了镓基催化剂观察到的高烯烃选择性以及显著副反应或积碳形成的缺失。

稳定的活性、低积碳形成和高乙烯选择性(在乙烷脱氢的情况下)支持了镓基催化剂的提议烷基机理。还原态Ga/ZSM-5中Brønsted酸性的缺失进一步证实了该机理与传统酸催化过程的不同性质。
