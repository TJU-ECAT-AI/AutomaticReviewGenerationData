[1] "At high temperatures dissociative hydrocarbon adsorption takes place, resulting in the formation of ethyl and hydride fragments coordinating to the cationic gallium species."

[2] "Ga1 adsorbs ethane much more weakly and dissociative ethane adsorption was only found upon heating to 523 K. In this case ethane dissociation proceeds via oxidative addition to Ga1 ions, giving ethyl and hydride fragments coordinating to Ga31 species."

[3] "Further heating in vacuum leads to the dissociation of the ethyl fragment into ethylene and gallium hydride species."

[4] "The only product observed during ethane conversion over Ga/ZSM-5 is ethylene."

The alkyl mechanism in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions on gallium-based catalysts involves several key steps:

1. Initial activation: At high temperatures, propane undergoes dissociative adsorption on the gallium active sites.

2. Formation of intermediates: This results in the formation of propyl and hydride fragments coordinating to the gallium species.

3. Product formation: Upon further heating, the propyl fragment dissociates to form propylene and gallium hydride species.

Comparing to the carbenium mechanism, the alkyl mechanism does not involve the formation of carbocations. Instead, it proceeds through organometallic intermediates.

The CH activation step is likely proposed as the rate-determining step (RDS) because it involves breaking a strong CH bond, which typically requires significant energy input.

The alkyl mechanism applies to different Ga species structures, particularly reduced Ga+ cations. These univalent gallium ions can undergo oxidative addition with the alkane, forming Ga3+ species coordinated with alkyl and hydride fragments.

This mechanism explains the high selectivity towards olefins observed with gallium-based catalysts, as seen in the literature where ethylene was the only product from ethane conversion over Ga/ZSM-5.

镓基催化剂上丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应的烷基机理涉及几个关键步骤：

1. 初始活化：在高温下，丙烷在镓活性位点上发生解离吸附。

2. 中间体形成：这导致丙基和氢化物片段与镓物种配位形成。

3. 产物形成：进一步加热时，丙基片段解离形成丙烯和镓氢化物物种。

与碳正离子机理相比，烷基机理不涉及碳正离子的形成。相反，它通过有机金属中间体进行。

CH活化步骤很可能被提出为速率决定步骤（RDS），因为它涉及打破强CH键，这通常需要大量能量输入。

烷基机理适用于不同的Ga物种结构，特别是还原态的Ga+阳离子。这些一价镓离子可以与烷烃进行氧化加成，形成与烷基和氢化物片段配位的Ga3+物种。

这一机理解释了镓基催化剂观察到的高烯烃选择性，正如文献中所见，在Ga/ZSM-5上乙烷转化的唯一产物是乙烯。
