The alkyl mechanism for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) on gallium-based catalysts involves several key steps:

1. Weak adsorption of propane on Ga+ sites at elevated temperatures.
2. Oxidative addition of propane to Ga+ ions, forming propyl and hydride fragments coordinated to Ga3+ species.
3. Decomposition of the propyl fragment into propylene and gallium hydride species.
4. Desorption of propylene as the product.
5. Regeneration of the Ga+ active site through desorption of hydrogen.

This mechanism differs from the carbenium mechanism, which involves the formation of carbocations as intermediates. The alkyl mechanism does not generate Brønsted acid sites or carbocations, leading to more stable and selective dehydrogenation.

The C-H activation step is likely proposed as the rate-determining step (RDS) because it involves breaking a strong C-H bond and requires significant energy input. This step determines the overall reaction rate and is typically the most difficult to overcome energetically.

The alkyl mechanism applies to different Ga species structures, such as isolated Ga+ ions or small Ga clusters. The key aspect is the ability of Ga species to undergo oxidative addition and facilitate C-H bond activation without generating strong acid sites. This mechanism explains the high selectivity towards olefins and the absence of significant side reactions or coke formation observed with Ga-based catalysts.

The stable activity, low coke formation, and high selectivity to ethylene (in the case of ethane dehydrogenation) support the proposed alkyl mechanism for Ga-based catalysts. The absence of Brønsted acidity in reduced Ga/ZSM-5 further confirms the distinct nature of this mechanism compared to traditional acid-catalyzed processes.

镓基催化剂上丙烷脱氢(PDH)的烷基机理涉及几个关键步骤：

1. 在高温下丙烷在Ga+位点上的弱吸附。
2. 丙烷对Ga+离子的氧化加成，形成与Ga3+物种配位的丙基和氢化物片段。
3. 丙基片段分解为丙烯和镓氢化物。
4. 丙烯作为产物脱附。
5. 通过氢气脱附再生Ga+活性位点。

这种机理与碳正离子机理不同，后者涉及碳正离子中间体的形成。烷基机理不会产生Brønsted酸位或碳正离子，从而导致更稳定和选择性的脱氢。

C-H活化步骤很可能被提出为速率决定步骤(RDS)，因为它涉及断裂强C-H键，需要大量能量输入。这一步骤决定了整体反应速率，通常是能量上最难克服的。

烷基机理适用于不同的Ga物种结构，如孤立的Ga+离子或小的Ga簇。关键在于Ga物种进行氧化加成和促进C-H键活化的能力，而不产生强酸位。这种机理解释了镓基催化剂观察到的高烯烃选择性以及显著副反应或积碳形成的缺失。

稳定的活性、低积碳形成和高乙烯选择性(在乙烷脱氢的情况下)支持了镓基催化剂的提议烷基机理。还原态Ga/ZSM-5中Brønsted酸性的缺失进一步证实了该机理与传统酸催化过程的不同性质。

The alkyl mechanism in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions on gallium-based catalysts involves several key steps:

1. Initial activation: At high temperatures, propane undergoes dissociative adsorption on the gallium active sites.

2. Formation of intermediates: This results in the formation of propyl and hydride fragments coordinating to the gallium species.

3. Product formation: Upon further heating, the propyl fragment dissociates to form propylene and gallium hydride species.

Comparing to the carbenium mechanism, the alkyl mechanism does not involve the formation of carbocations. Instead, it proceeds through organometallic intermediates.

The CH activation step is likely proposed as the rate-determining step (RDS) because it involves breaking a strong CH bond, which typically requires significant energy input.

The alkyl mechanism applies to different Ga species structures, particularly reduced Ga+ cations. These univalent gallium ions can undergo oxidative addition with the alkane, forming Ga3+ species coordinated with alkyl and hydride fragments.

This mechanism explains the high selectivity towards olefins observed with gallium-based catalysts, as seen in the literature where ethylene was the only product from ethane conversion over Ga/ZSM-5.

2. 中间体形成：这导致丙基和氢化物片段与镓物种配位形成。

3. 产物形成：进一步加热时，丙基片段解离形成丙烯和镓氢化物物种。

与碳正离子机理相比，烷基机理不涉及碳正离子的形成。相反，它通过有机金属中间体进行。

CH活化步骤很可能被提出为速率决定步骤（RDS），因为它涉及打破强CH键，这通常需要大量能量输入。

烷基机理适用于不同的Ga物种结构，特别是还原态的Ga+阳离子。这些一价镓离子可以与烷烃进行氧化加成，形成与烷基和氢化物片段配位的Ga3+物种。

这一机理解释了镓基催化剂观察到的高烯烃选择性，正如文献中所见，在Ga/ZSM-5上乙烷转化的唯一产物是乙烯。

The alkyl mechanism in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions on gallium-based catalysts involves several key steps:

1. Initial activation: Propane is dissociatively adsorbed on the gallium active sites at high temperatures.

2. C-H bond activation: The propane molecule undergoes C-H bond cleavage, forming a propyl fragment and a hydride species, both coordinated to the gallium cation.

3. β-hydride elimination: The propyl fragment undergoes β-hydride elimination, resulting in the formation of propene and another hydride species on the gallium.

4. Product desorption: Propene desorbs from the catalyst surface.

5. Catalyst regeneration: The hydride species recombine and desorb as molecular hydrogen, regenerating the active gallium site.

The alkyl mechanism differs from the carbenium mechanism primarily in the nature of the reaction intermediates. In the alkyl mechanism, alkyl species are formed on the gallium sites, while the carbenium mechanism involves the formation of carbocations on Brønsted acid sites.

The C-H activation step is proposed as the rate-determining step (RDS) in the alkyl mechanism because it involves breaking a strong C-H bond, which typically requires the highest activation energy in the overall reaction pathway.

The alkyl mechanism applies to different Ga species structures, including isolated Ga+ cations and GaH2+ species. The mechanism remains consistent across these structures, with the gallium species acting as the active site for propane activation and dehydrogenation. The stability of the gallium hydride species and the absence of Brønsted acid site formation contribute to the selective formation of olefins and the resistance to coke formation observed in gallium-based catalysts.

在镓基催化剂上进行的丙烷脱氢(PDH)反应中的烷基机理涉及几个关键步骤：

1. 初始活化：丙烷在高温下在镓活性位上发生解离吸附。

2. C-H键活化：丙烷分子发生C-H键断裂，形成丙基片段和氢化物物种，两者都与镓阳离子配位。

3. β-氢消除：丙基片段发生β-氢消除，产生丙烯和另一个氢化物物种在镓上。

4. 产物脱附：丙烯从催化剂表面脱附。

5. 催化剂再生：氢化物物种重新结合并以分子氢的形式脱附，从而再生活性镓位点。

烷基机理与碳正离子机理的主要区别在于反应中间体的性质。在烷基机理中，烷基物种在镓位点上形成，而碳正离子机理涉及在Brønsted酸位点上形成碳正离子。

C-H活化步骤被提议为烷基机理中的速率决定步骤(RDS)，因为它涉及打破强C-H键，这通常在整个反应路径中需要最高的活化能。

烷基机理适用于不同的Ga物种结构，包括孤立的Ga+阳离子和GaH2+物种。该机理在这些结构中保持一致，镓物种作为丙烷活化和脱氢的活性位点。镓氢化物物种的稳定性和Brønsted酸位点形成的缺失导致了在镓基催化剂中观察到的烯烃选择性形成和抗积碳性能。

The alkyl mechanism for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) on gallium-based catalysts can be inferred from the ethane activation mechanism described in the text, with some extrapolation to propane:

1. Initial activation: Propane is weakly adsorbed on Ga1 sites at low temperatures. Upon heating (around 523 K for ethane), propane undergoes dissociative adsorption via oxidative addition to Ga1 ions.

2. Formation of alkyl and hydride species: This dissociation results in the formation of a propyl fragment and a hydride, both coordinated to a Ga31 species.

3. β-hydride elimination: The propyl fragment undergoes β-hydride elimination, leading to the formation of propene and a second Ga-H bond.

4. Product desorption: Propene desorbs from the catalyst surface.

5. Catalyst regeneration: The gallium dihydride species releases H2, regenerating the active Ga1 site.

The key difference between the alkyl mechanism and the carbenium mechanism is the nature of the intermediate species. In the alkyl mechanism, a covalently bonded alkyl-metal species is formed, while the carbenium mechanism involves the formation of a carbocation intermediate.

The C-H activation step is likely proposed as the rate-determining step (RDS) because it involves breaking a strong C-H bond and requires significant activation energy. This is supported by the observation that dissociative adsorption only occurs at elevated temperatures.

The alkyl mechanism applies to different Ga species structures, particularly focusing on isolated Ga1 ions. The text doesn't provide information on how this mechanism might vary with different Ga structures, but it's reasonable to assume that the basic steps would remain similar, with possible variations in reactivity or selectivity depending on the specific Ga species present.

镓基催化剂上丙烷脱氢(PDH)反应的烷基机理可以从文中描述的乙烷活化机理推断出来，并稍加推广到丙烷：

1. 初始活化：丙烷在低温下被弱吸附在Ga1位点上。在加热时（乙烷约为523 K），丙烷通过氧化加成到Ga1离子上进行解离吸附。

2. 形成烷基和氢化物物种：这种解离导致形成丙基片段和氢化物，两者都与Ga31物种配位。

3. β-氢消除：丙基片段经历β-氢消除，生成丙烯和第二个Ga-H键。

4. 产物脱附：丙烯从催化剂表面脱附。

5. 催化剂再生：镓二氢化物物种释放H2，重新生成活性Ga1位点。

烷基机理和碳正离子机理的主要区别在于中间体物种的性质。在烷基机理中，形成共价键合的烷基-金属物种，而碳正离子机理涉及碳正离子中间体的形成。

C-H活化步骤可能被提出为速率决定步骤(RDS)，因为它涉及断裂强C-H键，需要显著的活化能。这一点由解离吸附仅在高温下发生的观察结果支持。

烷基机理适用于不同的Ga物种结构，特别是针对孤立的Ga1离子。文中没有提供关于这种机理如何随不同Ga结构而变化的信息，但可以合理地假设基本步骤保持相似，根据存在的特定Ga物种，反应性或选择性可能会有所不同。

4. Product desorption: Propylene desorbs from the catalyst surface.

5. Catalyst regeneration: The gallium dihydride species releases H2, regenerating the active Ga1+ site.

Compared to the carbenium mechanism, which involves the formation of carbocation intermediates, the alkyl mechanism proceeds through organometallic-like intermediates without generating Brønsted acid sites.

The C-H activation step is likely proposed as the rate-determining step (RDS) because it involves breaking a strong C-H bond and requires significant activation energy. This step also determines the overall rate of propane conversion to propylene.

The alkyl mechanism applies to different Ga species structures, particularly isolated Ga1+ ions in zeolites or supported on other materials. The mechanism may vary slightly depending on the support and the exact nature of the Ga species (e.g., monomeric vs. dimeric Ga sites), but the general steps of oxidative addition, β-hydride elimination, and H2 release are expected to be consistent across different Ga-based catalysts.

This mechanism explains the observed stability of Ga-based catalysts, the absence of significant coke formation, and the high selectivity towards olefins (ethylene in the case of ethane dehydrogenation, which would translate to propylene for PDH).

基于镓催化剂的丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应的烷基机理可以从文献中描述的乙烷活化机理推断出来，并针对丙烷进行一些修改：

1. 初始活化：丙烷在升高的温度下（乙烷约为523 K）弱吸附在Ga1+位点上。

2. C-H键活化：丙烷对Ga1+离子进行氧化加成，形成与Ga3+物种配位的丙基和氢化物片段。

3. β-氢消除：丙基片段进行β-氢消除，生成丙烯和第二个与镓配位的氢化物。

4. 产物脱附：丙烯从催化剂表面脱附。

5. 催化剂再生：镓二氢化物释放H2，重新生成活性Ga1+位点。

与涉及碳正离子中间体形成的碳正离子机理相比，烷基机理通过类有机金属中间体进行，而不产生布朗斯特酸位点。

C-H活化步骤可能被提出为速率决定步骤（RDS），因为它涉及断裂强C-H键并需要显著的活化能。这一步骤也决定了丙烷转化为丙烯的整体速率。

烷基机理适用于不同的Ga物种结构，特别是在沸石中或负载在其他材料上的孤立Ga1+离子。根据载体和Ga物种的确切性质（例如，单体与二聚体Ga位点），该机理可能略有不同，但氧化加成、β-氢消除和H2释放的一般步骤预计在不同的基于Ga的催化剂中是一致的。

这种机理解释了观察到的基于Ga的催化剂的稳定性、没有明显的积碳形成以及对烯烃的高选择性（在乙烷脱氢的情况下为乙烯，对于PDH则转化为丙烯）。
