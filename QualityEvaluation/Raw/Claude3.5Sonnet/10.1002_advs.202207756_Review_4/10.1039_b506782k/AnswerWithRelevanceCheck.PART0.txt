          "On the contrary, Ga1 adsorbs ethane much more weakly and dissociative ethane adsorption was only found upon heating to 523 K. In this case ethane dissociation proceeds via oxidative addition to Ga1 ions, giving ethyl and hydride fragments coordinating to Ga31 species."

"ZO  Ga1  C2H6 - ZO  [Ga31(H)(C2H5)]1"

"Further heating in vacuum leads to the dissociation of the ethyl fragment into ethylene and gallium hydride species."

"ZO[Ga31(H)(C2H5)]1 - ZO[Ga31(H)2]1  C2H4"

"Ga/ZSM-5 shows a stable activity as a function of the reaction time. Moreover, the catalyst remains white after reaction, indicative of the absence of large amounts of coke formation."

"The only product observed during ethane conversion over Ga/ZSM-5 is ethylene. The further conversion of ethylene to oligomers or aromatics is impeded by the absence of Brnsted acidity in reduced Ga/ZSM-5"

          The alkyl mechanism for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) on gallium-based catalysts involves several key steps:

1. Initial activation: At high temperatures (around 523 K), propane undergoes weak, dissociative adsorption on Ga+ active sites.

2. C-H bond activation: Propane dissociation occurs via oxidative addition to Ga+ ions, forming propyl and hydride fragments coordinated to Ga3+ species.

3. β-hydride elimination: The propyl fragment undergoes β-hydride elimination, resulting in the formation of propene and gallium hydride species.

4. Product desorption: Propene desorbs from the catalyst surface.

5. Catalyst regeneration: The gallium hydride species recombine and desorb as molecular hydrogen, regenerating the active Ga+ site.

Compared to the carbenium mechanism, the alkyl mechanism does not involve the formation of carbocations or Brønsted acid sites. Instead, it proceeds through organometallic-like intermediates.

The C-H activation step is proposed as the rate-determining step (RDS) because it involves breaking a strong C-H bond, which typically requires significant energy input and determines the overall reaction rate.

The alkyl mechanism applies to different Ga species structures, including isolated Ga+ ions and small Ga clusters. The key aspect is the ability of Ga species to undergo oxidative addition and facilitate C-H bond activation without generating strong acid sites.

This mechanism explains the observed stability of Ga-based catalysts, the absence of significant coke formation, and the high selectivity towards olefins. The lack of Brønsted acidity in reduced Ga/ZSM-5 prevents further conversion of olefins to oligomers or aromatics, contributing to the high selectivity.

          镓基催化剂上丙烷脱氢(PDH)的烷基机理涉及几个关键步骤：

1. 初始活化：在高温下（约523 K），丙烷在Ga+活性位点上发生弱的解离吸附。

2. C-H键活化：丙烷通过对Ga+离子的氧化加成进行解离，形成与Ga3+物种配位的丙基和氢化物片段。

3. β-氢消除：丙基片段经历β-氢消除，生成丙烯和镓氢化物物种。

4. 产物脱附：丙烯从催化剂表面脱附。

5. 催化剂再生：镓氢化物物种重新结合并以分子氢的形式脱附，再生活性Ga+位点。

与碳正离子机理相比，烷基机理不涉及碳正离子或Brønsted酸位的形成。相反，它通过类有机金属中间体进行。

C-H活化步骤被提议为速率决定步骤（RDS），因为它涉及断裂强C-H键，通常需要大量能量输入，并决定了整体反应速率。

烷基机理适用于不同的Ga物种结构，包括孤立的Ga+离子和小型Ga簇。关键在于Ga物种进行氧化加成和促进C-H键活化的能力，而不产生强酸位。

这种机理解释了观察到的镓基催化剂的稳定性、显著积碳形成的缺失以及对烯烃的高选择性。还原态Ga/ZSM-5中Brønsted酸性的缺失阻止了烯烃进一步转化为低聚物或芳烃，从而贡献了高选择性。
