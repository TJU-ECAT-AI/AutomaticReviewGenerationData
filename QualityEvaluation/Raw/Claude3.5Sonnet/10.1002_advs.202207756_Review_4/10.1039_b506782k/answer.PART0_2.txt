[1] "At high temperatures dissociative hydrocarbon adsorption takes place, resulting in the formation of ethyl and hydride fragments coordinating to the cationic gallium species."

[2] "Whereas in the zinc case a Brnsted acid proton is formed upon ethane dissociation, decomposition of the ethyl fragment on gallium results in gallium dihydride species and does not lead to Brnsted acid protons."

[3] "ZO  Ga1  C2H6 - ZO  [Ga31(H)(C2H5)]1"

[4] "ZO[Ga31(H)(C2H5)]1 - ZO[Ga31(H)2]1  C2H4"

[5] "Ga/ZSM-5 shows a stable activity as a function of the reaction time. Moreover, the catalyst remains white after reaction, indicative of the absence of large amounts of coke formation."

[6] "The only product observed during ethane conversion over Ga/ZSM-5 is ethylene. The further conversion of ethylene to oligomers or aromatics is impeded by the absence of Brnsted acidity in reduced Ga/ZSM-5"

The alkyl mechanism in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions on gallium-based catalysts involves several key steps:

1. Initial activation: Propane is dissociatively adsorbed on the gallium active sites at high temperatures.

2. C-H bond activation: The propane molecule undergoes C-H bond cleavage, forming a propyl fragment and a hydride species, both coordinated to the gallium cation.

3. β-hydride elimination: The propyl fragment undergoes β-hydride elimination, resulting in the formation of propene and another hydride species on the gallium.

4. Product desorption: Propene desorbs from the catalyst surface.

5. Catalyst regeneration: The hydride species recombine and desorb as molecular hydrogen, regenerating the active gallium site.

The alkyl mechanism differs from the carbenium mechanism primarily in the nature of the reaction intermediates. In the alkyl mechanism, alkyl species are formed on the gallium sites, while the carbenium mechanism involves the formation of carbocations on Brønsted acid sites.

The C-H activation step is proposed as the rate-determining step (RDS) in the alkyl mechanism because it involves breaking a strong C-H bond, which typically requires the highest activation energy in the overall reaction pathway.

The alkyl mechanism applies to different Ga species structures, including isolated Ga+ cations and GaH2+ species. The mechanism remains consistent across these structures, with the gallium species acting as the active site for propane activation and dehydrogenation. The stability of the gallium hydride species and the absence of Brønsted acid site formation contribute to the selective formation of olefins and the resistance to coke formation observed in gallium-based catalysts.

在镓基催化剂上进行的丙烷脱氢(PDH)反应中的烷基机理涉及几个关键步骤：

1. 初始活化：丙烷在高温下在镓活性位上发生解离吸附。

2. C-H键活化：丙烷分子发生C-H键断裂，形成丙基片段和氢化物物种，两者都与镓阳离子配位。

3. β-氢消除：丙基片段发生β-氢消除，产生丙烯和另一个氢化物物种在镓上。

4. 产物脱附：丙烯从催化剂表面脱附。

5. 催化剂再生：氢化物物种重新结合并以分子氢的形式脱附，从而再生活性镓位点。

烷基机理与碳正离子机理的主要区别在于反应中间体的性质。在烷基机理中，烷基物种在镓位点上形成，而碳正离子机理涉及在Brønsted酸位点上形成碳正离子。

C-H活化步骤被提议为烷基机理中的速率决定步骤(RDS)，因为它涉及打破强C-H键，这通常在整个反应路径中需要最高的活化能。

烷基机理适用于不同的Ga物种结构，包括孤立的Ga+阳离子和GaH2+物种。该机理在这些结构中保持一致，镓物种作为丙烷活化和脱氢的活性位点。镓氢化物物种的稳定性和Brønsted酸位点形成的缺失导致了在镓基催化剂中观察到的烯烃选择性形成和抗积碳性能。
