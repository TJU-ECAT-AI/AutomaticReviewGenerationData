[1] "Ga1 adsorbs ethane much more weakly and dissociative ethane adsorption was only found upon heating to 523 K. In this case ethane dissociation proceeds via oxidative addition to Ga1 ions, giving ethyl and hydride fragments coordinating to Ga31 species."

[2] "ZO  Ga1  C2H6 - ZO  [Ga31(H)(C2H5)]1"

[3] "Further heating in vacuum leads to the dissociation of the ethyl fragment into ethylene and gallium hydride species."

[4] "ZO[Ga31(H)(C2H5)]1 - ZO[Ga31(H)2]1  C2H4"

[5] "Ga/ZSM-5 shows a stable activity as a function of the reaction time. Moreover, the catalyst remains white after reaction, indicative of the absence of large amounts of coke formation."

[6] "The only product observed during ethane conversion over Ga/ZSM-5 is ethylene."

The alkyl mechanism for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) on gallium-based catalysts can be inferred from the ethane activation mechanism described in the literature, with some modifications for propane:

1. Initial activation: Propane weakly adsorbs on Ga1+ sites at elevated temperatures (around 523 K for ethane).

2. C-H bond activation: Oxidative addition of propane to Ga1+ ions occurs, forming propyl and hydride fragments coordinated to Ga3+ species.

3. β-hydride elimination: The propyl fragment undergoes β-hydride elimination, resulting in propylene formation and a second hydride coordinated to gallium.

4. Product desorption: Propylene desorbs from the catalyst surface.

5. Catalyst regeneration: The gallium dihydride species releases H2, regenerating the active Ga1+ site.

Compared to the carbenium mechanism, which involves the formation of carbocation intermediates, the alkyl mechanism proceeds through organometallic-like intermediates without generating Brønsted acid sites.

The C-H activation step is likely proposed as the rate-determining step (RDS) because it involves breaking a strong C-H bond and requires significant activation energy. This step also determines the overall rate of propane conversion to propylene.

The alkyl mechanism applies to different Ga species structures, particularly isolated Ga1+ ions in zeolites or supported on other materials. The mechanism may vary slightly depending on the support and the exact nature of the Ga species (e.g., monomeric vs. dimeric Ga sites), but the general steps of oxidative addition, β-hydride elimination, and H2 release are expected to be consistent across different Ga-based catalysts.

This mechanism explains the observed stability of Ga-based catalysts, the absence of significant coke formation, and the high selectivity towards olefins (ethylene in the case of ethane dehydrogenation, which would translate to propylene for PDH).

基于镓催化剂的丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应的烷基机理可以从文献中描述的乙烷活化机理推断出来，并针对丙烷进行一些修改：

1. 初始活化：丙烷在升高的温度下（乙烷约为523 K）弱吸附在Ga1+位点上。

2. C-H键活化：丙烷对Ga1+离子进行氧化加成，形成与Ga3+物种配位的丙基和氢化物片段。

3. β-氢消除：丙基片段进行β-氢消除，生成丙烯和第二个与镓配位的氢化物。

4. 产物脱附：丙烯从催化剂表面脱附。

5. 催化剂再生：镓二氢化物释放H2，重新生成活性Ga1+位点。

与涉及碳正离子中间体形成的碳正离子机理相比，烷基机理通过类有机金属中间体进行，而不产生布朗斯特酸位点。

C-H活化步骤可能被提出为速率决定步骤（RDS），因为它涉及断裂强C-H键并需要显著的活化能。这一步骤也决定了丙烷转化为丙烯的整体速率。

烷基机理适用于不同的Ga物种结构，特别是在沸石中或负载在其他材料上的孤立Ga1+离子。根据载体和Ga物种的确切性质（例如，单体与二聚体Ga位点），该机理可能略有不同，但氧化加成、β-氢消除和H2释放的一般步骤预计在不同的基于Ga的催化剂中是一致的。

这种机理解释了观察到的基于Ga的催化剂的稳定性、没有明显的积碳形成以及对烯烃的高选择性（在乙烷脱氢的情况下为乙烯，对于PDH则转化为丙烯）。
