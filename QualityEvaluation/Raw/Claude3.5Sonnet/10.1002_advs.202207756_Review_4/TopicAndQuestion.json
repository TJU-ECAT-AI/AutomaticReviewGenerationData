    "QuestionEnglish": "Provide a comprehensive explanation of the alkyl mechanism in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions on gallium-based catalysts, detailing its key steps from initial propane activation to product formation. Compare this mechanism to the carbenium mechanism, discuss why the CH activation step is proposed as the rate-determining step (RDS), and explain how the alkyl mechanism applies to different Ga species structures.",
    "QuestionChinese": "全面解释镓基催化剂上丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中的烷基机制，详细说明从初始丙烷活化到产物形成的关键步骤。将此机制与碳正离子机制进行比较，讨论为什么CH活化步骤被提议为速率决定步骤（RDS），并解释烷基机制如何适用于不同的Ga物种结构。"
