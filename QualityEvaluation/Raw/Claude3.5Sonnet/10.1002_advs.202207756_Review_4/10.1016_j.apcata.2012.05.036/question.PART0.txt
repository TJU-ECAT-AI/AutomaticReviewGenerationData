 Introduction
Aromatization
 of
 light
 alkanes
 (methane
 to
 butane)
 has
 been
extensively
 studied,
 because
 of
 its
 economic
 and
 strategic
 impor-
tance
 in
 terms
 of
 the
 exploitation
 of
 natural
 gas
 resources
 and
valorization
 of
 light
 hydrocarbons
 obtained
 in
 petroleum
 refining.
Commercially,
 this
 process
 using
 mainly
 gallium-modified
 zeolite
catalysts
 of
 MFI
 type
 is
 named
 Cyclar,
 and
 was
 developed
 jointly
by
 UOP
 and
 British
 Petroleum
 (BP)
 [1].  Most
 of
 these
 studies
 date
from
 the
 90s
 (for
 a
 review
 see
 Ref.
 [4]),
 but
 recently
 interest
 in
studying
 these
 catalysts
 was
 renewed
 [225],
 due
 to
 the
 worldwide
growing
 importance
 of
 GTL
 technologies.
Although
 several
 papers
 in
 the
 literature
 suggest
 that
 the
 active
gallium
 species
 under
 reductive
 conditions
 is
 a
 dihydridogallium
cation,
 GaH2+,
 little
 experimental
 evidence
 really
 corroborate
 this
hypothesis
 [4,10,2225]
 and
 only
 a
 few
 papers
 actually
 demon-
strate
 that
 these
 species
 are
 formed
 under
 real
 aromatization
conditions.

 of
 the

 of

 observed
that
 zeolite
 Brnsted

 are
 replaced
 by

 and
 the

 of

 the

 at

propane
 was
 converted
 only
 on
 Ga+ sites,
 producing
 exclusively
propene.
According
 to
 several
 papers
 [5,13,24,30,31]
 the
 oxidized
 gallium
species
 observed
 in
 model
 catalysts,
 the
 gallyl
 ion
 (Ga
 =
 O+),
 is
 more
active
 than
 the
 reduced
 gallium
 species
 formed
 during
 the
 reaction.
However,
 gallyl
 ions
 have
 been
 found
 not
 to
 be
 regenerated
 in
 situ
in
 the
 absence
 of
 an
 oxidizing
 agent
 like
 water
 [30,32].
It
 can
 be
 seen
 that
 determining
 the
 role
 of
 gallium
 and
 reactant
activation
 mechanisms
 has
 proven
 difficult,
 due
 to
 the
 multiplicity
of
 gallium
 species
 that
 have
 been
 proposed
 to
 exist
 in
 these
 cata-
lysts
 under
 reaction
 conditions
 and
 the
 lack
 of
 consensus
 on
 which
is
 the
 active
 one.
This
 work
 is
 part
 of
 a
 project
 which
 aims
 to
 contribute
 to
 the
solution
 of
 some
 standing
 questions
 involving
 alkane
 aromatiza-
tion
 on
 Ga/HZSM5
 catalysts.
 Previously
 [6],  our
 group
 studied
 by
EXAFS
 the
 nature
 of
 the
 gallium
 species
 obtained
 by
 impregnation
of
 different
 amounts
 of
 gallium
 (210
 wt.%)
 in
 a
 HZSM5
 zeolite
 and
their
 effects
 on
 1-butene
 aromatization
 activity.
 It
 was
 observed
that
 the
 increase
 in
 gallium
 content
 leads
 to
 the
 preferential
 for-
mation
 of
 a
 segregated
 -Ga2O3 phase
 at
 the
 external
 surface
 of
the
 zeolite
 and
 favors
 the
 formation
 of
 agglomerated
 species
 inside
the
 zeolites
 channels
 with
 low
 aromatization
 activity.
 The
 gallium
species
 with
 better
 dispersion
 formed
 at
 lower
 gallium
 loadings
showed
 higher
 activity.
In
 another
 work
 [19],
 we  established
 quantitative
 correlations
between
 the
 dispersion,
 acidity,
 reducibility
 and
 catalytic
 activity
for
 propane
 aromatization
 of
 Ga/HZSM5
 catalysts
 in
 the
 oxidized
form,
 with
 varying
 composition

 ratio

gallium
 content).
 It
 was
 determined
 that
 dispersed
 oxidic
 gallium
species
 coexist
 in
 the
 catalysts
 with
 condensed
 species,
 and
 the
proportion
 of
 the
 dispersed
 species
 decreases
 with
 the
 increase
 in
Ga/Al
 ratio.
 Gallium
 incorporation,
 besides
 decreasing
 the
 density
of
 Brnsted
 acid
 sites
 when
 compared
 to
 the
 pure
 zeolites,
 caused
the
 appearance
 of
 strong
 Lewis
 acid
 sites
 related
 to
 the
 presence
 of
dispersed
 gallium
 species.
 These
 species
 were
 more
 easily
 reduced
than
 more
 condensed
 gallium
 ones.
 A
 correlation
 with
 good
 linear-
ity
 was
 found
 between
 the
 initial
 propane
 aromatization
 activity
 at
703
 K
 and
 the
 product
 of
 the
 concentrations
 of
 Lewis
 and
 Brnsted
strong
 acid
 sites,
 which
 points
 to
 the
 need
 of
 both
 types
 of
 sites
 in
the
 oxidized
 form
 of
 the
 catalyst
 for
 a
 good
 aromatization
 activity
of
 the
 final
 catalyst.
Experiments
 using
 propane
 pulses
 [20]
 showed
 that
 the
 active
sites
 in
 propane
 dehydrogenation
 activity
 are
 generated
 by
 the
exposure
 of
 the
 catalyst
 in
 its
 oxidized
 form
 to
 propane
 itself.
 After
 a
few
 pulses,
 a
 constant
 propane
 conversion
 and
 a
 1:1
 ratio
 between
produced
 hydrogen
 and
 converted
 propane
 were
 achieved,
 with
the
 simultaneous
 formation
 of
 propene
 and
 other
 hydrocarbons.
Also
 in
 situ
 XAFS
 experiments,
 under
 propane
 or
 hydrogen
atmospheres
 in
 aromatization
 conditions,
 showed
 that
 reduced
gallium
 in
 Ga/HZSM5
 catalysts
 are
 isolated
 species
 coordinated
to
 a
 single
 oxygen
 atoms
 [21].
 Furthermore,
 the
 extrapolation
 of
the
 observed
 correlation
 between
 the
 Ga
 coordination
 number
 and
state
 of
 reduction
 suggested
 that,
 in
 the
 first
 stages
 of
 the
 reduc-
tion,
 condensed
 gallium
 species
 present
 in
 the
 oxidized
 catalysts
are
 converted
 to
 dimeric
 oxidic
 species,
 which
 are
 then
 reduced
 to
Ga+.
In
 the
 present
 work,
 we
 report
 on
 the
 study,
 by
 infrared
 spec-
troscopy,
 of
 the
 genesis,
 nature
 and
 stability
 of
 the
 species
 produced
under
 propane
 or
 hydrogen
 flow,
 at
 alkane
 aromatization
 temper-
atures
 on
 Ga/HZSM5.
 We  try
 to
 use
 these
 results,
 together
 with
our
 previous
 catalyst
 characterization,
 to
 interpret
 product
 distri-
butions
 in
 propane
 aromatization
 in
 mechanistic
 terms,
 especially
the
 alkane
 activation
 steps.
 To
 this
 end,
 the
 study
 of
 the
 effect
 of
hydrogen
 partial
 pressure
 on
 catalyst
 activity
 and
 selectivity
 was
of
 considerable
 importance.

 Experimental
2.1.
 Catalyst
 preparation
Catalysts
 containing
 2,
 3
 and
 4
 wt.%
 gallium,
 supported
 on
 an
HZSM5
 zeolite
 with
 silica-to-alumina
 ratio
 (SAR)
 35,
 were
 pre-
pared
 by
 incipient
 wetness
 impregnation
 with
 a
 gallium
 nitrate
solution
 and
 calcined
 at
 773
 K
 for
 4
 h
 under
 a
 200
 mL/min
 flow
of
 dry
 air.
 The
 gallium-modified
 zeolites
 were
 then
 subjected
 to
two
 reduction/oxidation
 cycles:
 reduction
 was
 performed
 under
 a
hydrogen
 flow
 of
 200
 mL/min
 at
 783
 K
 and
 oxidation
 under
 an
 air
flow
 of
 200
 mL/min
 at
 the
 same
 temperature.
 Catalysts
 prepared
in
 this
 way
 with
 2,
 3
 and
 4
 wt.%
 of
 gallium
 were
 named,
 respec-
tively,
 T2GaZ35,
 T3GaZ35
 and
 T4GaZ35.
 For
 more
 details
 on
 catalyst
preparation
 and
 the
 naming
 scheme

 Ref.
 [19].
2.2.
 FTIR
 of
 adsorbed
 pyridine
The
 experiments
 were
 performed
 using
 self-supported
 wafers
of
 sample
 T2GaZ35,
 with
 an
 area
 density
 of
 approximately
7.5
 mg  cm2,
 in
 an
 infrared
 cell
 with
 CaF2 windows
 adapted
 for
in
 situ
 treatments.
 The
 catalyst
 was
 analyzed
 as
 prepared,
 after
reduction
 at
 783
 K
 for
 4
 h
 with
 200
 mL/min
 flow
 of
 pure
 hydro-
gen
 and
 after
 re-oxidation
 with
 air
 under
 the
 same
 conditions.
 The
reduced
 sample
 was
 pre-treated
 at
 673
 K
 for
 4
 h
 under
 vacuum
 for
obtaining
 the
 background
 spectrum.
 Pyridine
 was
 then
 adsorbed
 to
a
 267
 Pa
 equilibrium
 pressure,
 at
 323
 K.
 FTIR
 spectra
 were
 recorded
after
 consecutive
 evacuations
 at
 323,
 373,
 423,
 473,
 573,
 and
 673
 K.
2.3.
 In
 situ
 DRIFTS
In
 situ
 DRIFTS
 experiments
 were
 made
 using
 a
 Praying
 Mantis
type
 diffuse
 reflectance
 cell
 and
 a
 flow-through
 reaction
 chamber
(both
 from
 Harrick
 Sci.).
 DRIFTS
 spectra
 were
 obtained
 during
 cata-
lysts
 reduction
 with
 pure
 hydrogen,
 reaction
 with
 2%
 C3H8/He
 and
reduction
 followed
 by
 reaction.
 After
 each
 experiment
 the
 reduc-
tion/reaction
 gas
 was
 substituted
 by
 an
 inert
 gas
 in
 order
 to
 flush
loosely
 bound
 species.
 Gas
 flows
 were
 at
 50
 mL/min
 and
 exper-
iments
 were
 made
 at
 703
 and
 783
 K
 with
 post-flush
 at
 reaction
temperature
 and
 also
 at
 323
 K.
 All
 gases
 were
 purified
 for
 contam-
ination
 with
 oxygen
 and
 water.
2.4.
 Catalytic
 tests
The
 catalytic
 tests
 for
 propane
 conversion
 in
 the
 gas
 phase
were
 conducted
 in
 a
 batch
 recirculating
 apparatus
 at
 703
 K
 and
atmospheric
 pressure.
 The
 initial
 partial
 pressure
 of
 propane
 in
the
 reaction
 loop
 was
 2.0
 kPa.
 A
 known
 amount
 of
 nitrogen
was
 added
 to
 the
 reacting
 system
 as
 an
 internal
 standard,
 and
the
 balance
 was
 helium.
 Experiments
 to
 probe
 the
 influence
 of
hydrogen
 during
 reaction
 used
 partial
 pressures
 of
 0
 (reaction
with
 pure
 propane),
 2.0,
 2.8,
 4.9
 and
 6.0
 kPa
 of
 this
 gas
 and
 the
catalyst
 with
 3
 wt.%
 of
 gallium
 (T3GaZ35).
 The
 analysis
 of
 the
reaction
 mixture
 was
 made
 by
 periodic
 sample
 withdrawal
 from
the
 gas
 phase,
 which
 was
 injected
 in
 a
 methylsiloxane
 capillary
column
 (100
 m
 ×
 0.25
 mm
 ×
 0.5
 m
 thickness)
 installed
 in
 an
 Agi-
lent
 6890
 gas
 chromatograph
 equipped
 with
 a
 mass
 selective
detector
 (quadrupole

 Chromato-
graphic
 area
 conversion
 into
 concentrations
 was
 made
 by
 means
 of
response
 factors
 determined
 by
 calibration
 in
 our
 laboratory.
 The
experiments
 were
 performed
 with
 approximately
 65
 mg
 mass
 of
catalyst,
 with
 the
 exception
 of
 the
 catalytic
 tests
 with
 the
 pure
 zeo-
lite
 sample
 (TZ35),
 where
 200
 mg
 were
 used
 due
 to
 its
 low
 activity.

 Results

 Adsorbed
 pyridine
 infrared
 spectroscopy
In
 order
 to
 verify
 the
 effects
 of
 reductive
 and
 oxidative
 treat-
ments
 on
 the
 acidity
 of
 Ga/HZSM5
 catalysts,
 these
 catalysts
 were
characterized
 by
 adsorbed
 pyridine
 FTIR
 spectroscopy
 as
 prepared,
after
 reduction
 in
 hydrogen
 flow
 at
 783
 K
 and
 after
 re-oxidation
 at
this
 same
 temperature.
 Fig.
 1
 shows
 the
 results
 of
 this
 analysis
 for
catalyst
 T2GaZ35.
Fig.
 1a
 shows
 the
 infrared
 spectrum
 of
 the
 as-prepared
 sam-
ple
 after
 pyridine
 adsorption
 and
 evacuation
 at
 423
 K.
 The
 infrared
bands
 used
 in
 this
 work
 to
 separately
 quantify
 the
 Lewis
 and
Brnsted
 acid
 sites
 were
 the
 peaks
 at,
 approximately,
 1450
 and
1540
 cm1,
 corresponding
 to
 pyridine
 coordinated
 to
 a
 Lewis
 acid
site
 and
 pyridine
 adsorbed
 under
 protonated
 form
 (pyridinium
ion),
 respectively.
 The
 method
 and
 integrated
 molar
 extinction
coefficients
 (IMEC)
 used
 for
 quantification
 can
 be
 found
 in
 Ref.
 [18].
Observing
 Fig.
 1bd,
 it
 is
 possible
 to
 infer
 that,
 during
 catalyst
reduction,
 there
 is
 an
 increase
 in
 the
 concentration
 of
 Lewis
 acid
sites,
 which
 occurs
 in
 parallel
 with
 a
 decrease
 in
 the
 concentration
of
 Brnsted
 acid
 sites,
 with
 the
 total
 acid
 site
 concentration
 remain-
ing
 essentially
 constant.
 This
 corroborates
 the
 hypothesis
 raised
 in
the
 literature
 [2,5]
 and
 in
 our
 previous
 work
 [21]
 that
 the
 reductive
treatment
 favors
 gallium
 dispersion.
 An
 interesting
 fact
 here
 is
 that
the
 reduced
 gallium
 species
 apparently
 act
 as
 Lewis
 acid
 sites.
 On
the
 other
 hand,
 during
 catalyst
 re-oxidation
 the
 opposite
 occurs:
 a
decrease
 in
 the
 concentration
 of
 Lewis
 acid
 sites
 and
 an
 increase

the
 concentration
 of
 Brnsted
 acid
 sites,
 showing
 that
 the
 gallium
dispersion
 process
 is
 reversible.
 It
 is
 interesting
 to
 notice
 that
 this
process
 was
 only
 partially
 reversed,
 as
 Lewis
 and
 acid
 sites
 concen-
tration
 in
 the
 catalyst
 as
 prepared
 and
 after
 re-oxidation
 are
 not
the
 same.
Fig.
 1d
 shows
 that
 the
 generation
 of
 Lewis
 sites
 is
 in
 an
 essen-
tially
 1:1
 basis
 with
 respect
 to
 Brnsted
 acid
 site
 consumption.
 In
our
 previous
 work
 [21]
 we
 showed
 that
 gallium
 reduction
 may
occur
 from
 a
 variety
 of
 binuclear
 gallium
 species
 with
 charges
 vary-
ing
 from
 0
 to
 2+.
 The
 Lewis
 acidity
 of
 these
 species
 is
 supposed
to
 increase
 with
 increasing
 charge.
 The
 observed
 increase
 in
 Lewis
acidity
 with
 simultaneous
 decrease
 in
 Brnsted
 acidity
 upon
 reduc-
tion
 may
 be
 explained
 by
 some
 of
 the
 reactions
 proposed
 in
 that
paper
 [21].
 Thus,
 the
 reduction
 of
 a
 singly
 charged
 binuclear
 gallium
species
 may
 involve
 the
 following
 overall
 reaction:
ZGa2O2(OH)+ +
 2H2 +
 ZH
 
 2ZGa+ +
 3H2O
 
(1)
In
 these
 reactions,
 Zrepresents
 an
 ion-exchange
 site
 at
 the
zeolite
 framework,
 i.e.,  two
 surface
 oxygen
 atoms
 connected
 to
 a
single
 aluminum
 atom,
 and
 ZH
 is
 a
 Brnsted
 acid
 site.
 Reduction
of
 neutral
 binuclear
 species,
 which
 is
 probably
 more
 difficult
 than
reduction
 of
 charged
 species,
 may
 also
 lead
 to
 a
 1:1
 replacement
 of
zeolite
 protons
 by
 isolated
 gallium
 ions:
Ga2O3·xH2O
 +
 2H2 
 Ga2O
 +
 (2
 +
 x)H2O
 
(2)
Ga2O
 +
 2ZH
 
 2ZGa+ +
 2H2O
 
(3)
In
 reaction
 (3),  xH2O
 implies
 that
 the
 gallium
 species
 is
 hydrox-
ylated
 and
 x
 may
 lie
 between
 0
 and
 2.
Finally,
 in
 the
 spectrum
 obtained
 after
 reduction
 of
 sample
T2GaZ35
 at
 783
 K
 and
 subsequent
 evacuation,
 two
 peaks
 associ-
ated
 with
 dihydridogallium
 cations
 (GaH2+)
 were
 observed:
 one
with
 wavenumber
 2042
 cm1,
 related
 to
 the
 stretching
 of
 Ga
 H
bonds
 [1517],  and
 another
 with
 wavenumber
 of
 953
 cm1 which
has
 not
 been
 previously
 reported
 in
 the
 literature
 and
 is
 probably
due
 to
 the
 bending
 mode
 of
 the
 hydrogen
 atoms
 in
 GaH2+ group.
This
 implies
 that,
 as
 already
 shown
 in
 the
 literature
 [5,13,1517],
hydrogen
 may
 dissociate
 on
 gallium
 sites
 to
 produce
 the
 hydride.
These
 peaks
 disappear
 after
 the
 re-oxidation
 treatment.
In
 the
 literature,
 several
 papers
 indicate
 that
 the
 GaH2+ species
could
 be
 the
 active
 one
 in
 Ga/HZSM5
 catalysts
 under
 reductive
 con-
ditions
 [4,10,2225].
 In
 principle,
 the
 observation
 of
 these
 peaks
in
 the
 infrared
 spectra
 of
 reduced
 catalysts
 would
 strengthen
this
 hypothesis,
 as
 the
 dihydridogallium
 cation
 would
 be
 a
 stable
species
 that
 resists
 evacuation.
 However,
 it
 is
 still
 necessary
 to
 ver-
ify
 that
 this
 same
 species
 is
 observed
 under
 propane
 atmosphere,
indicating
 that
 it
 is
 also
 present
 during
 the
 aromatization
 reaction.
Experiments
 trying
 to
 elucidate
 this
 possibility
 were
 made
 using
in
 situ
 diffuse
 reflectance
 infrared
 Fourier
 transform
 spectroscopy
which
 will
 be
 shown
 in
 the
 next
 section.
3.2.
 In
 situ
 DRIFTS
As
 seen
 in
 the
 previous
 section,
 the
 transmission
 FTIR
 spectra
 of
reduced
 catalysts
 showed
 two
 absorption
 features
 with
 wavenum-
bers
 of
 2042
 and
 953
 cm1 related,
 respectively,
 to
 the
 stretching
of
 Ga
 H
 bonds
 [1517]
 and
 bending
 mode
 of
 the
 GaH2+ group.
 This
fact
 was
 corroborated
 by
 DRIFTS
 results
 in
 all
 Ga/HZSM5
 catalysts
studied
 here,
 where
 two
 unresolved
 bands
 (2036
 and
 2052
 cm1)
were
 observed
 and
 attributed
 again
 to
 the
 stretching
 of
 the
 Ga
 H
bond
 [1517].  The
 peak
 at
 953
 cm1 was
 not
 observed
 during
DRIFTS
 experiments
 because
 it
 is
 overlapped
 by
 the
 structural
bands
 of
 the
 zeolites,
 which
 dominate
 the
 spectra
 below
 2000
 cm1.
Fig.

 shows
 these
 results
 for
 the
 catalyst
 T2GaZ35
 during
 reduc-
tion
 at
 703
 and
 783
 K
 and
 catalysts
 T3GaZ35
 and
 T4GaZ35
 during
reduction
 at
 703
 K,
 after
 subtraction
 of
 the
 spectra
 under
 argon
flow
 in
 all
 cases.
 Therefore,
 in
 this
 figure,
 positive
 peaks
 represent
the
 formation
 and
 negative
 peaks
 the
 consumption
 of
 species
 upon
reduction.
Fig.

 shows
 a
 decrease
 in
 the
 concentration
 of
 Brnsted
 acid
sites
 (3594
 cm1)
 in
 parallel
 with
 the
 appearance
 of
 the
 dihydrido-
gallium
 species.
 This
 confirms
 that
 during
 reduction
 the
 dispersion
of
 gallium
 increases
 and
 that
 dispersed
 gallium
 species
 are
 located
at
 the
 ion
 exchange
 sites
 of
 the
 zeolite.

 This
 is
 consistent
 with
 reactions
 (1)(3)
 dis-
cussed
 above.
A
 band
 at
 3736
 cm1 due
 to
 silanol
 groups
 appears
 upon
 reduc-
tion
 and
 comparison
 of
 Fig.
 2(a)
 and
 (b)
 shows
 that
 its
 intensity
increases
 with
 increasing
 reduction
 temperature.
 The
 growth
 of
this
 band
 is
 most
 probably
 due
 to
 de-alumination
 of
 the
 zeolite
framework,
 that
 we
 observed
 before
 using
 FTIR
 and
 solid
 state
 NMR
techniques
 (27Al
 and 29Si)
 [19].
It
 has
 been
 pointed-out
 by
 one
 of
 the
 referees
 to
 this
 paper
that
 the
 appearance
 of
 the
 silanol
 band,
 together
 with
 the
 decrease
in
 intensity
 of
 the
 bridge-bonded
 OH
 band
 (Brnsted
 acid
 sites)
at
 3594
 cm1,
 could
 indicate
 that
 the
 gallium
 atoms
 are
 actually
inserted
 in
 the
 zeolite
 framework
 and
 reduction
 results
 in
 the
breakage
 of
 Si
 OH+
Ga
 bonds.
 However,
 this
 interpretation
 is
 not
consistent
 with
 our
 previous
 EXAFS
 characterization
 of
 the
 oxide
form
 of
 the
 catalysts
 [19],
 where
 it
 was
 found
 that
 the
 main
 effect
of
 gallium
 incorporation
 into
 the
 zeolite
 is
 the
 appearance
 of
 strong
Lewis
 acid
 sites
 at
 the
 expenses
 of
 Brnsted
 acid
 sites.
 Furthermore,
our
 simultaneous
 EXAFS
 and
 XANES
 study
 of
 Ga/HZSM5
 reduction
[21]
 showed
 that
 gallium
 is
 initially
 present
 in
 the
 oxide
 form
 of
these
 catalysts
 as
 binuclear
 or
 larger
 oxidic
 gallium
 species,
 that
are
 transformed
 into
 atomically
 dispersed
 reduced
 gallium
 species
upon
 reduction
 with
 hydrogen
 or
 propane.
 This
 is
 of
 course
 not
consistent
 with
 gallium
 being
 part
 of
 the
 zeolite
 framework
 in
 the
oxide
 form
 of
 the
 catalysts.
It
 can
 also
 be
 observed
 from
 curves
 (a)
 and
 (b)
 in
 Fig.
 2
 that
 the
increase
 in
 reduction
 temperature
 of
 catalyst
 T2GaZ35
 does
 not
lead
 to
 significant
 changes
 in
 the
 hydridogallium
 band,
 but
 leads
to
 further
 decrease
 of
 the
 band
 related
 to
 the
 Brnsted
 acid
 sites
and
 increase
 in
 the
 band
 attributed
 to
 silanol
 groups,
 which
 is
 also
evidence
 of
 de-alumination,
 rather
 than
 consumption
 of
 gallium-
associated
 Brnsted
 acid
 sites
 to
 produce
 hydridogallium
 species.
Fig.

 shows
 the
 DRIFT
 spectra
 of
 T2GaZ35
 catalyst
 after
 reduc-
tion
 in
 hydrogen
 at

 K
 and
 subsequent
 purge
 with
 argon
 at
 this
same
 temperature
 for
 different
 times.
 The
 results
 in
 Fig.
 3
 show
that
 the
 formation
 of
 dihydridogallium
 species
 at
 high
 tempera-
ture
 is
 reversible
 by
 the
 replacement
 of
 hydrogen
 flow
 by
 argon.
In
 this
 case
 peaks
 related
 to
 the
 stretching
 of
 Ga
 H
 bonds
 (marked
with
 the
 vertical
 line
 at
 2044
 cm1)
 almost
 completely
 disappear
after

lyst

 are
 analogous
 to

(3600

 are
 marked
 with
 vertical

 As
 is
 clear
 from
 this
figure,
 the
 intensity
 of
 the
 silanol
 peaks
 is
 constant
 during
 the
purge
 with
 argon,
 suggesting
 that,
 after
 the
 initial
 de-alumination
which
 occurs
 during
 the
 reduction
 process,
 there
 is
 no
 more
 alu-
minum
 loss
 by
 the
 framework
 and
 the
 de-alumination
 process,
as
 would
 be
 expected,
 is
 irreversible.
 On
 the
 other
 hand,
 it
 is
observed
 that,
 simultaneously
 with
 the
 decrease
 in
 the
 dihydri-
dogallium
 band,
 there
 is
 an
 increase
 in
 the
 concentration
 of
 the
Brnsted
 acid
 sites,
 along
 with
 an
 increase
 in
 the
 concentration
of
 OH
 groups
 bound
 to
 extra-framework
 gallium
 species.
 This
 fact
indicates
 that
 the
 increase
 in
 the
 dispersion
 of
 extra-framework
gallium
 species
 observed
 during
 hydrogen
 reduction
 is
 at
 least
 par-
tially
 reversible
 by
 the
 removal
 of
 its
 flow
 and
 therefore
 reactions
(1)(3)
 are
 reversible
 reactions.
 This
 also
 indicates
 that
 at
 least
 part
of
 the
 water
 produced
 during
 reduction
 stays
 adsorbed
 in
 the
 zeo-
lite,
 probably
 associated
 with
 extra-framework
 aluminum
 species.
These
 species
 are
 formed
 during
 the
 reduction
 of
 the
 catalyst
 and
might
 be
 contributing
 to
 the
 absorption
 maximum
 located
 near
3640
 cm1 observed
 with
 the
 reduced
 catalyst
 in
 Figs.
 2
 and
 3.
During
 argon
 purge
 at
 323
 K
 (after
 reduction
 at
 703
 K
 and
 cool-
ing
 in
 hydrogen
 to
 room
 temperature),
 no
 significant
 changes
 were
observed
 in
 the
 bands
 followed
 during
 the
 experiment,
 show-
ing
 that
 hydridogallium
 species
 are
 stable
 at
 low
 temperatures.
In
 experiments
 with
 unmodified
 HZSM5,
 no
 modifications
 were
observed
 in
 the
 DRIFTS
 spectra
 during
 reduction.
No
 peaks
 due
 to
 dihydridogallium
 ions
 were
 observed
 under
propane
 at
 aromatization
 conditions.
 Neither
 did
 the
 dihydridogal-
lium
 bands
 appear
 after
 purging
 with
 argon,
 either
 at
 the
 reaction
temperature
 (Fig.
 4a)
 or
 at
 323
 K.
 This
 clearly
 shows
 that
 the
 gal-
lium
 hydride
 species
 is
 not
 stable
 under
 propane
 aromatization
conditions.
 From
 this
 observation,
 we
 can
 conclude
 that
 it
 is
 very
improbable
 that
 the
 gallium
 hydride
 is
 the
 active
 species
 in
 the
aromatization
 reaction.
In
 the
 DRIFTS
 experiments
 with
 propane
 under
 aromatization
conditions,
 the
 irreversible
 formation
 of
 adsorbed
 alkyl
 species
(Fig.
 4a)
 was
 observed
 with
 Ga/HZSM5.
 These
 alkyl
 species
 were
identified
 from
 four
 peaks
 with
 the
 following
 wavenumbers:
2877,
 2900,
 2928
 and
 2967
 cm1,
 determined
 by
 deconvolution
of
 the
 experimental
 spectra
 with
 Gaussian
 peaks
 (R2 =
 0.9967),
as
 seen
 in
 Fig.
 4b.
 These
 bands
 were
 attributed
 to
 the
 follow-
ing
 vibration
 modes:
 s,CH2 (2877
 cm1),
 s,CH3 (2900
 cm1),
as,CH2 (2928
 cm1)
 and
 as,CH3 (2967
 cm1),
 based
 on
 the
 work
 of
Kubarkova
 et
 al.
 [26].
 They
 are
 characteristic
 of
 ethyl
 groups
 bonded
to
 gallium,
 but
 this
 same
 group
 of
 vibrations
 could
 also
 be
 attributed
to
 methyl
 and
 ethyl
 groups
 simultaneously
 bonded
 to
 gallium,
 as
methyl-gallium
 species
 have
 vibration
 frequencies
 at
 wavenum-
bers
 
of
 
approximately
 
2900
 
and
 
2965
 cm1,

to
 the
 s,CH3 and
 as,CH3 vibration
 modes,
 respectively,
 which
 are
very
 close
 to
 the
 ones
 observed
 here.
 Also,
 alkyl-gallium
 species
with
 three
 or
 more
 carbon
 atoms
 in
 the
 alkyl
 chain
 were
 ruled-
out
 in
 this
 work
 as
 these,
 according
 to
 the
 literature
 [26],
 should
exhibit
 vibration
 frequencies
 with
 wavenumbers
 between
 2715
and
 2750
 cm1.
Under
 propane
 aromatization
 conditions,
 a
 decrease
 in
 the
intensity
 of
 the
 bands
 corresponding
 to
 the
 Brnsted
 acid
 sites
and
 to
 OH
 groups
 bonded
 to
 extra-framework
 gallium
 species
 was
observed.
 As
 discussed
 before,
 this
 is
 associated
 to
 the
 increase
 in
the
 dispersion
 of
 gallium
 oxide
 oligomers
 during
 reductive
 treat-
ments
 and
 to
 de-alumination
 of
 the
 zeolite
 framework.
 From
 Fig.
 4
it
 can
 also
 be
 noticed
 that,
 in
 contrast
 to
 what
 was
 observed
 dur-
ing
 the
 experiments
 using
 hydrogen,
 during
 post-flush
 with
 argon,
there
 was
 no
 increase
 in
 the
 intensity
 of
 the
 peaks
 related
 to
extra-framework
 gallium
 species
 and
 to
 the
 Brnsted
 acid
 sites,
suggesting
 that
 alkyl
 groups
 bonded
 to
 gallium
 stabilize
 it
 in
its
 dispersed
 form.
 The
 same
 behavior
 was
 not
 observed
 during
the
 propane
 aromatization
 reaction
 over
 the
 pure
 zeolite,
 where
propane
 in
 the
 gas
 phase
 was
 completely
 removed
 from
 the
 sys-
tem
 30
 min
 after
 the
 beginning
 of
 the
 purge
 with
 argon
 and
 no
adsorbed
 species
 were
 retained
 by
 the
 catalyst.
In
 another
 experiment,
 catalyst
 reduction
 with
 hydrogen
 was
immediately
 followed
 by
 the
 propane
 aromatization
 reaction.
 The
results
 are
 shown
 in
 Fig.
 5.
 It
 is
 observed
 that
 the
 dihydridogal-
lium
 species
 formed
 during
 reduction
 disappeared
 between
 5
 and
15
 min
 after
 the
 change
 of
 the
 reacting
 flow
 (from
 hydrogen
 to
propane)
 as
 shown
 in
 Fig.
 5.
 It
 should
 be
 noticed
 that
 in
 the
 spec-
trum
 obtained
 after
 5
 min
 propane
 flow
 (not
 shown
 here),
 hydrogen
was
 not
 yet
 completely
 replaced
 by
 propane
 in
 the
 gas
 phase.
 This
is
 in
 sharp
 contrast
 with
 the
 results
 of
 the
 argon
 purge
 after
 reduc-
tion
 in
 hydrogen,
 where
 the
 dihydridogallium
 species
 could
 still
 be
clearly
 observed
 after
 purging
 for
 75
 min.

From

 course
 of
 the

 it
 was

 in

 as
 a

 of

 This

 shows
 that,
 before

 gallium
 modifi-
cation,
 initially
 the
 average
 product
 H/C
 ratio
 is
 higher,
 rapidly
decreasing
 until
 it
 reaches

 state.
 The
 values
 obtained
for
 initial

 H/C
 ratios
 during
 the

 were
2.8
 and

 for

 TZ35,
 and

 and
 1.5,
respectively,
 for

 T2GaZ35,

 and

 No
significant
 differences
 were
 noticed
 among
 the
 gallium

catalysts.
Fig.

 shows
 the
 concentrations
 of
 ethane,
 ethylene
 and
 methane
as
 a

 of

 time
 for

 TZ35
 and

 With
the
 pure
 zeolite,
 besides
 ethane,
 ethylene
 and
 methane
 are
 pro-
duced
 in
 almost
 equimolecular
 amounts.
 On
 the
 other
 hand,
 in
Ga/HZSM5
 catalysts
 (only
 T3GaZ35
 is
 shown),
 ethane
 and
 methane
are
 formed
 in
 equimolecular
 quantities.
In
 the
 case
 of
 Ga/HZSM5,
 ethylene
 is
 formed
 during
 the
 fast
initial
 reaction
 along
 with
 the
 other
 olefins,
 and,
 afterwards,
 its
concentration
 slowly
 decreases.
 It
 is
 interesting
 to
 notice
 that
 the
production
 of
 ethylene
 does
 not
 produce
 methane
 as
 its
 counter-
part,
 as
 would
 be
 expected
 if
 it
 had
 arisen
 from
 the
 propane
 cracking
reaction.
It
 was
 also
 observed
 that,
 on
 Ga/HZSM5,
 propylene
 is
 mostly
formed
 along
 with
 the
 other
 olefins
 in
 the
 fast
 initial
 reaction,
its
 concentration
 reaches
 a
 maximum
 and
 then
 decreases
 steadily
along
 with
 the
 propane
 concentration.
 In
 the
 unmodified
 zeolite,
the
 propylene/propane
 ratio
 increased
 along
 the
 whole
 reaction.
The
 propylene/propane
 ratio
 as
 a
 function
 of
 reaction
 time
 is
 shown
in
 Fig.
 9
 for
 catalysts
 TZ35
 and
 T3GaZ35.
The
 propene
 concentration
 at
 the
 first
 experimental
 point
 is
3.6
 ×
 105 mol
 dm3,
 while
 that
 of
 ethylene
 is
 ca.
 1.2
 ×
 105,
 i.e.,
 the
amount
 of
 ethylene
 formed
 in
 the
 initial
 fast
 reaction
 is
 a
 significant
fraction
 of
 the
 amount
 of
 propene.
Fig.
 10
 shows
 the
 concentrations
 of
 C4 hydrocarbons
 as
 a
 func-
tion
 of
 reaction
 time.
 It
 can
 be
 seen
 that,
 in
 the
 case
 of
 the
 pure
zeolite,
 the
 concentrations
 of
 C4 hydrocarbons
 increases
 steadily,
while
 in
 the
 Ga/HZSM5
 these
 concentrations
 go
 through
 a
 max-
imum,
 suffering
 a
 slow
 decrease
 afterwards.
 It
 is
 interesting
 to
notice
 that
 the
 sum
 of
 the
 butenes
 concentrations
 is
 one
 order
 of
magnitude
 smaller
 than
 the
 concentration
 of
 ethylene.

 concentrations

 In
 both
 cases
 the
 main
 reac-
tion
 products
 are
 benzene
 and
 toluene
 which
 are
 formed
 in
 almost
equimolecular
 proportions.
 It
 can
 also
 be
 observed
 that
 the
 dis-
tribution
 of
 aromatic
 hydrocarbons
 is
 very
 similar
 in
 both
 cases.
However,
 on
 the
 unmodified
 zeolite,
 the
 aromatic
 hydrocarbons
are
 clearly
 secondary
 products,
 while
 on
 Ga/HZSM5
 they
 appear
 as
primary
 reaction
 products.

In
 order
 to
 have
 an
 insight
 into
 the
 role
 of
 hydrogen
 in
 the
reaction,
 a
 series
 of
 experiments
 using
 a
 constant
 propane
 initial
partial
 pressure
 (2.0
 kPa)
 and
 varying
 the
 hydrogen
 partial
 pressure
in
 the
 system
 (0,
 2.0,
 2.8,
 4.9
 and
 6.0
 kPa)
 was
 performed.
 All
 of
 the
following
 tests
 were
 made
 using
 only
 the
 T3GaZ35
 catalyst.
Figs.
 12
 and
 13
 show
 how
 different
 groups
 of
 reactions
 are
 influ-
enced
 by
 the
 ratio
 of
 hydrogen
 to
 propane
 partial
 pressures
 at
 the
beginning
 of
 the
 reaction
 (from
 now
 on
 called
 just
 RHP).

shows
 the
 initial

 (methane,

 formation

 Analysis
 of
 Fig.

 shows
that
 all
 of
 the
 initial
 rates
 of
 alkanes
 formation
 go
 through
 a
 maxi-
mum.
The
 effect
 of
 RHP on
 the
 initial
 rate
 of
 formation
 of
 aromatic
hydrocarbons
 (benzene,
 toluene
 and
 xylenes
 +
 ethylbenzene)
 is
shown
 in
 Fig.

 In
 general,
 a
 decrease
 in
 aromatics
 formation
 can
be
 observed
 with
 the
 increase
 in
 hydrogen
 partial
 pressure.
 This
figure
 also
 shows
 that,
 with
 the
 increase
 in
 initial
 hydrogen
 partial
pressure,
 benzene
 formation
 is
 favored
 over
 the
 production
 of
 the
remaining
 aromatic
 hydrocarbons.

 Discussion
4.1.
 Reaction
 network
 and
 influence
 of
 hydrogen
 partial
 pressure
on
 product
 distributions
As
 shown
 in
 Table
 1,
 the
 initial
 rate
 of
 propane
 conversion
 is,
 at
least,
 18
 times
 higher
 on
 Ga/HZSM5
 catalysts
 than
 on
 the
 unmod-
ified
 zeolite,
 under
 the
 conditions
 used
 here.
 This
 result
 depends
little
 on
 the
 gallium
 content
 of
 the
 catalysts
 (a
 better
 discussion
 of
the
 effect
 of
 proton-gallium
 balance
 on
 activity
 is
 presented
 in
 Ref.
[19]).
 Considering
 only
 aromatization
 activities,
 gallium
 impreg-
nation
 leads
 to
 catalysts
 that
 are
 at
 least
 180
 times
 more
 active
than
 HZSM5.
 These
 results
 contrast
 with
 those
 published
 in
 the
 lit-
erature
 on
 alkenes
 aromatization
 (a
 few
 examples
 can
 be
 seen
 in
Ref.
 [4]),
 where
 reactant
 conversion
 is
 nearly
 independent
 of
 gal-
lium
 modification
 of
 the
 catalysts,
 but
 selectivities
 to
 saturated
 and
aromatic
 hydrocarbons
 change
 markedly.
Fig.
 7
 shows
 that
 product
 H/C
 ratios
 were
 significantly
 lower
in
 the
 case
 of
 Ga/HZSM5
 catalysts
 (1.5
 in
 Ga/HZSM5
 and
 2.2
 in
 the
unmodified
 zeolite
 at
 steady-state).
 The
 fact
 that,
 with
 the
 pure
 zeo-
lite,
 this
 ratio
 is
 close
 to
 2.0
 means
 that
 on
 this
 catalyst,
 after
 the
dehydrogenation
 step
 that
 produces
 alkene
 molecules,
 the
 dehy-
drocyclization
 reactions
 that
 lead
 to
 aromatic
 hydrocarbons
 occur
mainly
 by
 intermolecular
 hydride
 transfer,
 leading
 to
 overall
 reac-
tions
 such
 as
 reaction
 (4)
 below:
5C3H6 
 C6H6 +
 3C3H8
(4)
In
 contrast,
 the
 significantly
 lower
 H/C
 value
 observed
 with
Ga/HZSM5
 shows
 that
 in
 this
 case
 dehydrogenation
 reactions
leading
 to
 hydrogen
 evolution
 also
 contribute
 to
 alkene
 dehydro-
cyclization.
It
 should
 be
 noticed
 that
 the
 H/C
 values
 larger
 than
 2.0
 obtained
with
 the
 pure
 zeolite
 mean
 that
 alkene
 generation
 itself
 involves,
not
 only
 dehydrogenation,
 but
 also
 intermolecular
 hydride
 trans-
fer
 reactions,
 as
 reaction
 (5)
 shown
 below,
 that
 explains
 ethane
formation
 on
 the
 pure
 zeolite.

Meitzner
 et
 al.
 [2]
 and
 Biscardi
 and
 Iglesia
 [3]
 suggest
 that,
 on
Ga/HZSM5,
 alkane
 activation
 occurs
 on
 the
 zeolite
 acid
 sites
 and
the
 role
 of
 gallium
 is
 to
 provide
 an
 outlet
 for
 hydrogen
 desorp-
tion.
 In
 the
 pure
 zeolite,
 hydrogen
 desorption
 would
 be
 the
 rate
determining
 step
 (rds),
 which
 would
 cause
 a
 high
 hydrogen
 virtual
pressure
 [2,3],
 i.e.,
 a
 much
 higher
 hydrogen
 surface
 concentration
than
 expected
 from
 the
 hydrogen
 partial
 pressure
 in
 the
 gas
 phase.
Accepting
 the
 proposal
 of
 hydrogen
 desorption
 as
 the
 rds
 on
 the
pure
 zeolite
 (although
 not
 subscribing
 to
 the
 idea
 that
 in
 Ga/HZSM5
alkane
 activation
 occurs
 only
 on
 the
 zeolite
 acid
 sites),
 this
 elevated
hydrogen
 virtual
 pressure
 could
 lead
 to
 hydrogenolysis
 reactions
 in
such
 a
 way
 that
 reaction
 (5)
 would
 be
 more
 generally

[2729].

On
 the
 other
 hand,
 on
 Ga/HZSM5,
 propane
 hydrogenolysis,
 reac-
tion
 (10),
 seems
 to
 be
 the
 main
 route
 for
 methane
 and
 ethane
formation,
 as
 suggested
 by
 the
 similarity
 of
 the
 concentrations
these
 product
 with
 time.
 The
 hydrogen
 needed
 for
 the
 hydrogenol-
ysis
 reactions
 is
 produced
 in
 the
 dehydrogenation
 reactions
 that
lead
 to
 olefins
 and
 aromatic
 hydrocarbons
 formation.
C3H8 +
 H2 
 C2H6 +
 CH4
(10)
Regarding
 propene
 formation
 on
 Ga/HZSM5,
 the
 main
 source
of
 this
 product
 is
 surely
 the
 direct
 dehydrogenation
 of
 propane,
reaction
 (11):
C3H8 
 C3H6 +
 H2
(11)
It
 is
 worth
 noticing
 that
 most
 of
 the
 propene
 is
 produced
 in
the
 first
 5
 min
 of
 reaction
 (cf.
 Fig.
 9).
 Thereafter
 the
 propene-to-
propane
 ratio
 is
 nearly
 constant,
 i.e.,  a
 quasi-steady
 state
 is
 achieved
for
 propene
 production
 and
 consumption.
The
 production
 of
 ethylene
 with
 Ga/HZSM5
 is
 interesting,
 inas-
much
 as
 it
 seems
 to
 be
 formed
 without
 a
 corresponding
 production
of
 methane
 (cf.
 Fig.
 10b),
 so
 that
 reaction
 (9)
 above
 is
 not
 the
 main
one
 leading
 to
 its
 formation.
 Ethylene
 is
 most
 likely
 formed
 as
 a
 con-
sequence
 of
 oligomerization
 of
 propene
 and
 subsequent
 cracking.
The
 same
 type
 of
 mechanism
 must
 be
 responsible
 for
 the
 formation
of
 C4 hydrocarbons.
It
 is
 interesting
 that
 all
 alkenes
 are
 produced
 at
 the
 beginning
of
 the
 reaction
 (cf.
 Figs.
 810)
 on
 Ga/HZSM5.
 This
 means
 that
 the
oligomerization
 and
 cracking
 reactions
 that
 are
 necessary
 for
 their
formation
 and
 occur
 on
 the
 acid
 sites
 of
 the
 zeolite
 are
 fast
 under
the
 present
 conditions.
For
 all
 alkenes
 and
 C4 hydrocarbons
 in
 general,
 the
 concen-
trations
 reach
 a
 quasi-steady
 state
 on
 Ga/HZSM5
 catalysts,
 but,
on
 the
 pure
 zeolite
 concentrations
 increase
 steadily.
 This
 cer-
tainly
 happens
 because,
 on
 the
 gallium
 modified
 catalysts,
 these
hydrocarbons
 are
 largely
 consumed
 in
 the
 production
 of
 aromatic
hydrocarbons.
 In
 the
 case
 of
 the
 pure
 zeolite,
 the
 formation
 of
 alka-
nes
 and
 alkenes
 is
 favored
 over
 aromatization,
 which
 leads
 to
 their
accumulation,
 as
 there
 is
 no
 efficient
 route
 for
 their
 removal.
Despite
 the
 fact
 that
 the
 condensation
 of
 two
 C3 molecules
 fol-
lowed
 by
 dehydrocyclization
 leads
 to
 the
 formation
 of
 benzene,
it
 was
 observed
 that
 benzene
 and
 toluene
 are
 formed
 in
 almost
equimolecular
 proportions
 (cf.
 Fig.
 11).
 It
 can
 also
 be
 seen
 that
 the
distribution
 of
 aromatic
 hydrocarbons
 is
 very
 similar
 on
 both
 cata-
lysts.
 However,
 it
 cannot
 be
 inferred
 from
 this
 that
 the
 mechanism
of
 their
 formation
 is
 the
 same,
 as
 we
 have
 already
 established
 from
the
 H/C
 ratios
 in
 the
 products
 that
 dehydrocyclization
 on
 HZSM5
involves
 intermolecular
 hydride
 transfer
 reactions,
 whereas
 on
Ga/HZSM5
 it
 must
 involve
 hydrogen
 evolution.
 In
 the
 catalytic
 tests
using
 the
 pure
 zeolite,
 the
 production
 of
 aromatic
 hydrocarbons
displayed
 secondary
 product
 profiles
 (cf.
 Fig.
 11a),
 revealing
 their
multi-step
 formation
 with
 oligomerization
 of
 the
 olefins
 present
 in
the
 reaction
 system,
 followed
 by
 hydride
 transfer
 and
 cyclization.
In
 the
 case
 of
 the
 gallium
 modified
 catalysts,
 on
 the
 other
 hand,
 the
formation
 of
 aromatic
 hydrocarbons
 has
 a
 primary
 product
 pro-
file.
 This
 must
 be
 due
 to
 the
 fast
 initial
 formation
 of
 alkenes
 (cf.
Figs.
 810),
 so
 that
 already
 at
 the
 initial
 instants
 of
 the
 reaction
there
 is
 already
 a
 high
 concentration
 of
 the
 intermediates
 respon-
sible
 for
 aromatic
 hydrocarbons
 formation
 in
 the
 system.
It
 is
 also
 interesting
 that
 poly-unsaturated
 and
 cyclic
 hydrocar-
bons,
 which
 would
 be
 expected
 as
 intermediates
 in
 dehydrocy-
clization,
 were
 never
 observed
 in
 any
 significant
 amount,
 either
 on
HZSM5,
 or
 on
 Ga/HZSM5,
 although
 traces
 of
 these
 compounds
 were
indeed
 detected.
 Therefore,
 the
 conversion
 of
 these
 intermediates
is
 nearly
 as
 fast
 as
 their
 formation,
 on
 both
 types
 of
 catalysts,
 and
possibly
 the
 distribution
 of
 aromatic
 hydrocarbons
 is
 determined
more
 by
 thermodynamic
 than
 by
 mechanistic
 factors.

 shows
 maxima
 for
 the
 initial
 rate
 of
 formation
 of
 sat-
urated
 hydrocarbons
 as
 a
 function
 of
 the
 hydrogen
 to
 propane
ratio.
 Thus,
 while
 favoring
 hydrogenolysis
 over
 dehydrogenation
reactions,
 it
 is
 clear
 that
 hydrogen
 competes
 with
 propane
 for
the
 active
 sites.
 On
 the
 other
 hand,
 the
 initial
 rate
 of
 production
of
 aromatic
 hydrocarbons
 decreases
 steadily
 with
 the
 hydrogen-
to-propane
 ratio.
 This
 is
 probably
 due
 to
 the
 reversibility
 of
 the
dehydrogenation
 steps
 involved
 in
 dehydrocyclization.
 Besides,
 it
 is
also
 observed
 that
 the
 presence
 of
 hydrogen
 in
 the
 reaction
 system
strongly
 favors
 the
 production
 of
 benzene
 over
 toluene
 and
 xylenes.
A
 possible
 explanation
 is
 that
 formation
 of
 toluene
 and
 xylenes
involves
 the
 condensation
 of
 more
 than
 two
 propylene
 molecules
at
 some
 stage
 of
 the
 mechanism,
 so
 the
 decreased
 concentration
of
 alkenes
 in
 the
 system
 in
 the
 presence
 of
 hydrogen
 would
 more
strongly
 affect
 their
 formation
 than
 that
 of
 benzene.
4.2.
 Mechanistic
 inferences
As
 mentioned
 before,
 several
 studies
 in
 the
 literature
 show
that,
 in
 the
 absence
 of
 oxidizing
 agents
 in
 the
 reaction
 system,
the
 active
 gallium
 species
 present
 in
 the
 catalysts
 is
 in
 a
 reduced
state
 [225].
 Also,
 previous
 results
 from
 our
 group
 using
 propane
pulses
 [20]
 showed
 an
 increase
 in
 propane
 conversion
 with
 the
number
 of
 pulses
 injected
 at
 aromatization
 reaction
 temperatures.
At
 the
 same
 time,
 hydrogen
 evolution
 started
 from
 near
 zero
 at
 the
first
 pulse
 and
 increased
 steadily
 until
 a
 1:1
 ratio
 was
 obtained
between
 converted
 propane
 and
 hydrogen
 produced,
 unequivo-
cally
 establishing
 that
 gallium
 is
 reduced
 upon
 exposure
 to
 propane
at
 aromatization
 temperatures
 and
 that
 the
 reduced
 form
 of
 the
catalyst
 is
 more
 active
 than
 the
 oxidized
 form.
The
 reduction
 of
 gallium
 in
 the
 presence
 of
 propane,
 as
 well
as
 under
 hydrogen,
 under
 aromatization
 temperatures
 was
 con-
firmed
 from
 our
 in
 situ
 XAFS
 [21]
 results,
 where
 it
 was
 also
 shown
that
 the
 reduced
 gallium
 species
 is
 atomically
 dispersed.
 Reactions
(1)(3)
 discussed
 under
 Section
 3.1
 show
 how
 binuclear
 oxidic
 gal-
lium
 species
 may
 be
 reduced
 under
 hydrogen
 to
 produce
 reduced
isolated
 Ga+ ions,
 creating
 at
 the
 same
 time
 Lewis
 acid
 sites
 at
the
 expenses
 of
 Brnsted
 acid
 sites.
 Apart
 from
 those,
 reduction
of
 Ga2O22+ [21]
 and
 Ga
 =
 O+ (which
 may
 be
 present
 in
 catalyst
with
 small
 gallium
 loadings
 [19]),
 that
 do
 not
 lead
 to
 a
 decrease
in
 Brnsted
 acidity
 also
 have
 to
 be
 considered:

2+Z+
 2H2 
 2ZGa+ +
 2H2O
(12)
ZGa
 =
 O+ +
 H2
 ZGa+ +
 H2O
 
(13)
The
 FTIR
 results
 (cf.
 Fig.
 3)
 establish
 that
 dihydridogallium
species
 exist
 under
 hydrogen
 flow
 after
 reduction
 with
 hydrogen
at
 aromatization
 temperatures.
 Formation
 of
 this
 species
 is
 repre-
sented
 by
 reaction
 (14):
ZGa+ +
 H2 
 ZGaH2
+
(14)
This
 reaction
 is
 reversible,
 as
 it
 was
 shown
 that
 the
 dihydrido
species
 is
 decomposed
 by
 purging
 with
 argon,
 but
 the
 reversibility
is
 slow
 even
 under
 aromatization
 temperatures.
 The
 FTIR
 results
(cf.
 Fig.
 3)
 show
 that
 the
 dispersion
 of
 gallium
 is
 partially
 reversed
at
 aromatization
 temperatures
 once
 the
 hydrogen
 flow
 is
 replaced
by
 inert
 gas.
Our
 previous
 XAS
 results
 [21]
 also
 established
 that
 exposure
to
 propane
 under
 aromatization
 temperatures
 leads
 to
 gallium
species
 indistinguishable
 by
 this
 technique
 from
 the
 one
 obtained
under
 hydrogen.
 Therefore,
 propane
 may
 replace
 hydrogen
 as
 the
reducing
 agent.
 For
 example,
 in
 the
 presence
 of
 propane
 instead
 of
hydrogen,
 a
 reaction
 analogous
 to
 (12)
 would
 be:
ZGa2O2
2+Z

Analogous
 equations,
 with
 propane
 as
 the
 reducing
 agent
 and
propene
 evolution,
 would
 apply
 to
 reactions
 (1)
 and
 (2).
 This
 is
consistent
 with
 the
 fact
 that,
 with
 Ga/HZSM5,
 the
 initial
 H/C
 ratio
in
 the
 reaction
 products
 is
 very
 close
 to
 2.0,
 since
 on
 first
 contact
with
 the
 catalyst
 only
 alkenes
 are
 produced
 (cf.
 Fig.
 12).
As
 to
 alkane
 activation
 on
 the
 reduced
 catalyst,
 the
 idea
 that
a
 dihydridogallium
 ion
 could
 be
 the
 active
 species
 [2,4,10,2225]
is
 highly
 improbable,
 since
 this
 species
 was
 shown
 to
 disappear
in
 the
 presence
 of
 propane
 (cf.
 Fig.
 5).
 Neither
 do
 our
 results
support
 the
 idea
 that
 the
 dihydridogallium
 species
 could
 interme-
diate
 hydrogen
 desorption
 [2,12,16,17],
 as
 its
 decomposition
 under
argon
 is
 slow.
 Furthermore,
 stable
 alkylgallium
 species,
 proba-
bly
 methylethylgallium
 ions,
 were
 observed
 to
 be
 formed
 under
propane
 aromatization
 conditions.
 These
 observations
 are
 consis-
tent
 with
 the
 following
 sequence
 of
 steps:
ZGa+ +
 C3H8 
 ZGa+H(C3H7)
 
(16)
ZGa+H(C3H7)+ 
 ZGa+ +
 H2 +
 C3H6
(17)
ZGa+H(C3H7)
 
 ZGa+(CH3)(C2H5)
 
(18)
Besides
 these
 reactions,
 a
 further
 one
 is
 necessary
 to
 explain
 the
removal
 of
 hydride
 by
 reaction
 with
 propane:
ZGaH2
+ +
 C3H8 
 ZGaH(C3H7)+ +
 H2
(19)
A
 sequence
 of
 steps
 that
 corresponds
 essentially
 to
 reaction
 (19)
has
 been
 analyzed
 by
 Frash
 and
 van
 Santen
 [24]
 in
 their
 theoreti-
cal
 study
 of
 ethane
 activation
 on
 gallium-exchanged
 zeolites,
 with
dihydridogallium
 ions
 as
 the
 active
 sites.
 In
 their
 scheme,
 the
 alkyl-
hydridogallium
 species
 in
 reaction
 (19)
 decomposes
 to
 produce
an
 alkene
 molecule
 and
 regenerate
 the
 dihydrido
 active
 site.

results
 suggest
 that
 the
 decomposition
 of
 the
 alkylhydrido
 inter-
mediate
 occurs
 by
 reactions
 (17)
 and
 (18)
 instead.
Addition
 of
 hydrogen
 to
 the
 reaction
 medium
 suppresses
 the
aromatization
 reaction,
 possibly
 by
 reversal
 of
 reactions
 such
as
 (17)
 and
 other
 dehydrogenation
 steps
 involved
 in
 aromati-
zation.
 On
 the
 other
 hand,
 it
 strongly
 promotes
 the
 formation
of
 methane
 and
 ethane.
 However
 there
 is
 competition
 between
hydrogen
 and
 the
 hydrocarbon
 for
 the
 active
 sites
 (cf.
 Fig.
 12).
 A
LangmuirHinshelwood
 type
 of
 mechanism,
 such
 as
 represented
by
 reaction
 (20)
 is
 a
 likely
 possibility:
ZOGa+(CH3)(C2H5)
 +
 ZOGaH2
+ 
 2ZOGa+ +
 C2H6 +
 CH4
(20)
It
 should
 be
 reminded
 that
 the
 isolated
 gallium
 species
 are
formed
 from
 binuclear
 gallium
 oxidic
 species
 during
 reduction,
 so
pairs
 of
 reduced
 species
 are
 likely
 to
 be
 in
 close
 proximity
 in
 the
reduced
 form
 of
 the
 catalyst.
The
 reactions
 proposed
 in
 this
 article
 refer
 to
 the
 activation
of
 the
 catalysts
 at
 the
 beginning
 of
 the
 reaction
 and
 to
 propane
activation.
 In
 subsequent
 steps,
 the
 zeolite
 Brnsted
 acid
 sites
 are
responsible
 for
 oligomerization,
 cyclization
 and
 hydride
 transfer
reactions
 involved
 in
 the
 aromatization
 process,
 while
 reduced
gallium
 species
 are
 responsible
 for
 dehydrogenation
 reactions
[5,13,22,23,33,34].
Finally,
 Fig.

 shows
 a
 scheme
 summarizing
 the
 reactions
 pro-
posed
 in
 this
 work
 for
 propane
 activation
 in
 Ga/HZSM5

 Conclusion
The
 results
 in
 the
 present
 paper
 complement
 our
 previous
 ones
on
 the
 genesis
 of
 the
 reduced
 gallium
 species
 in
 Ga/HZSM5
 cata-
lysts.
 The
 formation
 of
 isolated
 Ga(I)
 species
 from
 binuclear
 oxidic
gallium
 clusters
 involves
 the
 production
 of
 Lewis
 from
 Brnsted
acid
 sites
 in
 a
 1:1
 basis.
 This
 process
 is
 accompanied
 by
 some
 de-
alumination
 of
 the
 zeolite
 framework
 to
 produce
 extraframework
alumina,
 which
 also
 helps
 to
 explain
 the
 decrease
 in
 Brnsted
 acid-
ity
 and
 increase
 in
 Lewis
 acidity.
 When
 hydrogen
 is
 the
 reducing
agent,
 the
 decomposition
 of
 the
 binuclear
 oxidic
 species
 is
 partially
reversed
 when
 hydrogen
 is
 replaced
 by
 inert
 gas,
 but
 when
 the
reducing
 agent
 is
 propane
 the
 formation
 of
 isolated
 Ga(I)
 species
is
 irreversible,
 probably
 because
 it
 is
 stabilized
 by
 alkyl
 groups
bonded
 to
 gallium,
 that
 were
 seen
 to
 be
 formed
 and
 to
 be
 stable
when
 propane
 flow
 is
 replaced
 by
 inert
 gas.
Dihydridogallium
 ions
 were
 observed
 after
 reduction
 in
 hydro-
gen,
 but
 were
 slowly
 decomposed
 when
 hydrogen
 flow
 was
replaced
 by
 inert
 gas.
 This
 slow
 decomposition
 of
 the
 dihydridogal-
lium
 ions
 shows
 that
 it
 cannot
 intermediate
 hydrogen
 desorption
during
 the
 aromatization
 reaction.
 However,
 when
 hydrogen
 is
replaced
 by
 propane,
 the
 dihydrido
 species
 appear
 to
 be
 rapidly
replaced
 by
 alkylgallium
 ions.
 Under
 propane
 flow,
 dihydridogal-
lium
 cations
 were
 never
 detected.
 These
 facts
 show
 that
 it
 cannot
be
 the
 active
 site
 for
 alkane
 activation,
 as
 proposed
 by
 some
 inves-
tigators.
It
 was
 also
 shown
 that
 gas
 phase
 hydrogen
 added
 at
 the
 begin-
ning
 of
 the
 reaction
 has
 a
 strong
 influence
 on
 catalysts
 activity
 and
selectivity.
 Our
 results
 demonstrate
 that,
 while
 dehydrogenation
reactions
 are
 inhibited
 by
 increasing
 hydrogen
 partial
 pressure,
hydrogenolysis
 activities
 go
 through
 a
 maximum.
 This
 maximum
shows
 that,
 while
 hydrogen
 takes
 part
 in
 hydrogenolysis
 reactions,
it
 competes
 with
 propane
 for
 the
 active
 sites.
 This
 pattern
 of
 behav-
ior
 confirms
 that
 dihydridogallium
 species
 cannot
 be
 the
 active
species
 in
 this
 system.
