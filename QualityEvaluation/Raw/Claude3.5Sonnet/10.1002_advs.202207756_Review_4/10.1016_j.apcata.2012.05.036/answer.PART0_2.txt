[5] "Dihydridogallium ions were observed after reduction in hydrogen, but were slowly decomposed when hydrogen flow was replaced by inert gas. This slow decomposition of the dihydridogallium ions shows that it cannot intermediate hydrogen desorption during the aromatization reaction."

[6] "However, when hydrogen is replaced by propane, the dihydrido species appear to be rapidly replaced by alkylgallium ions. Under propane flow, dihydridogallium cations were never detected. These facts show that it cannot be the active site for alkane activation, as proposed by some investigators."

The alkyl mechanism for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) on gallium-based catalysts involves several key steps:

1. Propane activation: The initial step involves the adsorption and activation of propane on the gallium active site (ZGa+). This results in the formation of an alkyl-hydride intermediate (ZGa+H(C3H7)).

2. Dehydrogenation: The alkyl-hydride intermediate then undergoes dehydrogenation, releasing hydrogen and forming propene. This step regenerates the original gallium active site.

3. Alkyl rearrangement: Alternatively, the alkyl-hydride intermediate can undergo rearrangement to form a more stable alkylgallium species (ZGa+(CH3)(C2H5)).

The alkyl mechanism differs from the carbenium mechanism primarily in the nature of the intermediates formed. While the carbenium mechanism involves the formation of carbocation intermediates, the alkyl mechanism proceeds through alkyl-metal intermediates.

The C-H activation step is proposed as the rate-determining step (RDS) in the alkyl mechanism because it involves breaking a strong C-H bond, which typically requires more energy compared to subsequent steps. This step determines the overall rate of the reaction.

The alkyl mechanism applies to different Ga species structures, but the reactivity may vary depending on the specific gallium species present. For example, the study shows that dihydridogallium ions (GaH2+) are not the active species for alkane activation, contrary to some previous proposals. Instead, isolated Ga(I) species appear to be more relevant for the alkyl mechanism.

The mechanism also explains the competition between hydrogen and propane for active sites, as observed in the study. This competition affects the overall reaction kinetics and product distribution in PDH reactions.

镓基催化剂上丙烷脱氢(PDH)的烷基机理包括几个关键步骤：

1. 丙烷活化：初始步骤涉及丙烷在镓活性位点(ZGa+)上的吸附和活化。这导致形成烷基-氢化物中间体(ZGa+H(C3H7))。

2. 脱氢：烷基-氢化物中间体随后经历脱氢，释放氢气并形成丙烯。这一步骤重新生成原始的镓活性位点。

3. 烷基重排：另外，烷基-氢化物中间体可以进行重排，形成更稳定的烷基镓物种(ZGa+(CH3)(C2H5))。

烷基机理与碳正离子机理的主要区别在于形成的中间体性质不同。碳正离子机理涉及碳正离子中间体的形成，而烷基机理则通过烷基-金属中间体进行。

C-H活化步骤被提出为烷基机理中的速率决定步骤(RDS)，因为它涉及断裂强C-H键，这通常比后续步骤需要更多能量。这一步骤决定了反应的整体速率。

烷基机理适用于不同的Ga物种结构，但反应性可能因存在的特定镓物种而异。例如，研究表明二氢化镓离子(GaH2+)并不是烷烃活化的活性物种，这与一些先前的提议相反。相反，单独的Ga(I)物种似乎与烷基机理更相关。

该机理还解释了研究中观察到的氢气和丙烷对活性位点的竞争。这种竞争影响PDH反应的整体反应动力学和产物分布。
