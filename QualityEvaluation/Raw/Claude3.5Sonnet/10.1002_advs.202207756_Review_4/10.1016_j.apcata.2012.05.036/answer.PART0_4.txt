The alkyl mechanism for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) on gallium-based catalysts involves several key steps:

1. Initial propane activation: Propane interacts with an isolated Ga+ site to form an alkyl-hydride intermediate (ZGa+H(C3H7)).

2. Dehydrogenation: This intermediate can undergo β-hydride elimination to produce propylene and hydrogen, regenerating the Ga+ site.

3. Rearrangement: Alternatively, the alkyl-hydride intermediate can rearrange to form a more stable alkylgallium species (ZGa+(CH3)(C2H5)).

The alkyl mechanism differs from the carbenium mechanism in that it involves direct C-H bond activation by the gallium site, rather than proceeding through a carbocation intermediate. The C-H activation step is proposed as the rate-determining step (RDS) because it involves breaking a strong C-H bond and forming new Ga-H and Ga-C bonds, which is energetically demanding.

This mechanism applies to different Ga species structures, particularly isolated Ga+ sites. The literature suggests that dihydridogallium (GaH2+) species, while observable under hydrogen, are not the active sites for alkane activation. When exposed to propane, these dihydrido species are rapidly replaced by alkylgallium ions, indicating that the alkyl mechanism is more relevant under reaction conditions.

The alkyl mechanism explains the observed formation of stable alkylgallium species during propane dehydrogenation and accounts for the competition between hydrogen and propane for active sites. It also provides a rationale for the inhibition of dehydrogenation reactions by increasing hydrogen partial pressure, as hydrogen can reverse some of the steps in the mechanism.

丙烷脱氢(PDH)在镓基催化剂上的烷基机理包括几个关键步骤：

1. 初始丙烷活化：丙烷与孤立的Ga+位点相互作用，形成烷基-氢化物中间体(ZGa+H(C3H7))。

2. 脱氢：该中间体可以经过β-氢消除产生丙烯和氢气，同时重新生成Ga+位点。

3. 重排：另外，烷基-氢化物中间体可以重排形成更稳定的烷基镓物种(ZGa+(CH3)(C2H5))。

烷基机理与碳正离子机理的不同之处在于，它涉及镓位点直接活化C-H键，而不是通过碳正离子中间体进行。C-H活化步骤被提出为速率决定步骤(RDS)，因为它涉及打破强C-H键并形成新的Ga-H和Ga-C键，这在能量上是要求较高的。

这种机理适用于不同的Ga物种结构，特别是孤立的Ga+位点。文献表明，虽然在氢气下可以观察到二氢化镓(GaH2+)物种，但它们不是烷烃活化的活性位点。当暴露于丙烷时，这些二氢化物种迅速被烷基镓离子取代，表明在反应条件下烷基机理更为相关。

烷基机理解释了在丙烷脱氢过程中观察到的稳定烷基镓物种的形成，并说明了氢气和丙烷对活性位点的竞争。它还为增加氢分压抑制脱氢反应提供了理论依据，因为氢气可以逆转机理中的一些步骤。
