[6] "However, when hydrogen is replaced by propane, the dihydrido species appear to be rapidly replaced by alkylgallium ions. Under propane flow, dihydridogallium cations were never detected. These facts show that it cannot be the active site for alkane activation, as proposed by some investigators."

The alkyl mechanism for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) on gallium-based catalysts involves several key steps:

1. Initial propane activation: Propane interacts with a gallium active site (Ga+) to form an alkyl-hydride intermediate (GaH(C3H7)+).

2. Dehydrogenation: The alkyl-hydride intermediate decomposes to release hydrogen and propene, regenerating the Ga+ site.

3. Alkyl rearrangement: Alternatively, the alkyl-hydride intermediate can rearrange to form a more stable alkylgallium species (Ga(CH3)(C2H5)+).

This mechanism differs from the carbenium mechanism, which involves the formation of carbocations as intermediates. The alkyl mechanism proposes direct C-H bond activation by the gallium species without carbocation formation.

The C-H activation step is often considered the rate-determining step (RDS) because it involves breaking a strong C-H bond and is typically the highest energy barrier in the overall reaction pathway.

The alkyl mechanism applies to different Ga species structures:

1. For isolated Ga+ sites, the mechanism proceeds as described above.

2. For GaH2+ species, an initial step involves the reaction with propane to form the alkyl-hydride intermediate, releasing H2.

3. However, the research shows that dihydridogallium ions (GaH2+) are not stable under propane flow and are rapidly replaced by alkylgallium species. This suggests that GaH2+ is not the active site for alkane activation, contrary to some previous proposals.

The alkyl mechanism explains the observed formation of stable alkylgallium species under reaction conditions and the absence of dihydridogallium species during propane dehydrogenation. It also accounts for the competition between hydrogen and propane for active sites, as observed in the catalytic studies.

丙烷脱氢(PDH)在镓基催化剂上的烷基机理包括几个关键步骤：

1. 初始丙烷活化：丙烷与镓活性位点(Ga+)相互作用，形成烷基-氢化物中间体(GaH(C3H7)+)。

2. 脱氢：烷基-氢化物中间体分解，释放氢气和丙烯，同时再生Ga+位点。

3. 烷基重排：或者，烷基-氢化物中间体可以重排，形成更稳定的烷基镓物种(Ga(CH3)(C2H5)+)。

这种机理与碳正离子机理不同，后者涉及碳正离子中间体的形成。烷基机理提出镓物种直接活化C-H键，而不形成碳正离子。

C-H活化步骤通常被认为是速率决定步骤(RDS)，因为它涉及打破强C-H键，通常是整个反应路径中能量障碍最高的步骤。

烷基机理适用于不同的Ga物种结构：

1. 对于孤立的Ga+位点，机理按上述描述进行。

2. 对于GaH2+物种，初始步骤涉及与丙烷反应形成烷基-氢化物中间体，释放H2。

3. 然而，研究表明，二氢化镓离子(GaH2+)在丙烷流下不稳定，迅速被烷基镓物种取代。这表明GaH2+不是烷烃活化的活性位点，与一些先前的提议相反。

烷基机理解释了在反应条件下观察到的稳定烷基镓物种的形成，以及丙烷脱氢过程中二氢化镓物种的缺失。它还解释了在催化研究中观察到的氢气和丙烷对活性位点的竞争。
