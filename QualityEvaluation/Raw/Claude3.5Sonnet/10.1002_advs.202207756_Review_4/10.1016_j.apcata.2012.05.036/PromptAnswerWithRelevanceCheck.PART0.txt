The alkyl mechanism for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) on gallium-based catalysts involves several key steps:

1. Initial propane activation: Propane interacts with a gallium active site (Ga+) to form an alkyl-hydride intermediate (GaH(C3H7)+).

2. Dehydrogenation: The alkyl-hydride intermediate decomposes to release hydrogen and propene, regenerating the Ga+ site.

3. Alkyl rearrangement: Alternatively, the alkyl-hydride intermediate can rearrange to form a more stable alkylgallium species (Ga(CH3)(C2H5)+).

This mechanism differs from the carbenium mechanism, which involves the formation of carbocations as intermediates. The alkyl mechanism proposes direct C-H bond activation by the gallium species without carbocation formation.

The C-H activation step is often considered the rate-determining step (RDS) because it involves breaking a strong C-H bond and is typically the highest energy barrier in the overall reaction pathway.

The alkyl mechanism applies to different Ga species structures:

1. For isolated Ga+ sites, the mechanism proceeds as described above.

2. For GaH2+ species, an initial step involves the reaction with propane to form the alkyl-hydride intermediate, releasing H2.

3. However, the research shows that dihydridogallium ions (GaH2+) are not stable under propane flow and are rapidly replaced by alkylgallium species. This suggests that GaH2+ is not the active site for alkane activation, contrary to some previous proposals.

The alkyl mechanism explains the observed formation of stable alkylgallium species under reaction conditions and the absence of dihydridogallium species during propane dehydrogenation. It also accounts for the competition between hydrogen and propane for active sites, as observed in the catalytic studies.

丙烷脱氢(PDH)在镓基催化剂上的烷基机理包括几个关键步骤：

1. 初始丙烷活化：丙烷与镓活性位点(Ga+)相互作用，形成烷基-氢化物中间体(GaH(C3H7)+)。

2. 脱氢：烷基-氢化物中间体分解，释放氢气和丙烯，同时再生Ga+位点。

3. 烷基重排：或者，烷基-氢化物中间体可以重排，形成更稳定的烷基镓物种(Ga(CH3)(C2H5)+)。

这种机理与碳正离子机理不同，后者涉及碳正离子中间体的形成。烷基机理提出镓物种直接活化C-H键，而不形成碳正离子。

C-H活化步骤通常被认为是速率决定步骤(RDS)，因为它涉及打破强C-H键，通常是整个反应路径中能量障碍最高的步骤。

烷基机理适用于不同的Ga物种结构：

1. 对于孤立的Ga+位点，机理按上述描述进行。

2. 对于GaH2+物种，初始步骤涉及与丙烷反应形成烷基-氢化物中间体，释放H2。

3. 然而，研究表明，二氢化镓离子(GaH2+)在丙烷流下不稳定，迅速被烷基镓物种取代。这表明GaH2+不是烷烃活化的活性位点，与一些先前的提议相反。

烷基机理解释了在反应条件下观察到的稳定烷基镓物种的形成，以及丙烷脱氢过程中二氢化镓物种的缺失。它还解释了在催化研究中观察到的氢气和丙烷对活性位点的竞争。

The alkyl mechanism for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) on gallium-based catalysts involves several key steps:

1. Initial propane activation: Propane adsorbs on the Ga+ active site, forming a Ga-alkyl intermediate (ZGa+H(C3H7)).

2. C-H bond activation: The Ga-alkyl species undergoes C-H bond cleavage, releasing H2 and forming propene (C3H6).

3. Product desorption: Propene desorbs from the catalyst surface, regenerating the Ga+ active site.

4. Side reactions: The Ga-alkyl intermediate can also undergo rearrangement to form a methylethylgallium species (ZGa+(CH3)(C2H5)).

The alkyl mechanism differs from the carbenium mechanism in that it involves direct C-H bond activation on the Ga site, rather than forming a carbocation intermediate on the zeolite acid sites.

The C-H activation step is proposed as the rate-determining step (RDS) because it involves breaking a strong C-H bond, which typically requires more energy than other steps in the mechanism.

The alkyl mechanism applies to different Ga species structures as follows:

1. Isolated Ga+ ions: These are considered the primary active sites for PDH, following the mechanism described above.

2. Dihydridogallium ions (GaH2+): Although previously thought to be active sites, the evidence suggests they are not involved in propane activation. They decompose slowly under inert gas and are rapidly replaced by alkylgallium species under propane flow.

3. Binuclear gallium species: These oxidic species are reduced to form isolated Ga+ ions, which then participate in the alkyl mechanism.

The alkyl mechanism explains the observed formation of stable alkylgallium species under reaction conditions and accounts for the rapid replacement of dihydridogallium species by alkylgallium ions in the presence of propane. This mechanism is consistent with the experimental observations and provides a more accurate description of the PDH process on gallium-based catalysts than previous proposals involving dihydridogallium ions as active sites.

钆基催化剂上丙烷脱氢(PDH)的烷基机理涉及几个关键步骤：

1. 初始丙烷活化：丙烷在Ga+活性位上吸附，形成Ga-烷基中间体(ZGa+H(C3H7))。

2. C-H键活化：Ga-烷基物种经历C-H键断裂，释放H2并形成丙烯(C3H6)。

3. 产物脱附：丙烯从催化剂表面脱附，重新生成Ga+活性位。

4. 副反应：Ga-烷基中间体还可以重排形成甲基乙基钆物种(ZGa+(CH3)(C2H5))。

烷基机理与碳正离子机理的不同之处在于，它涉及Ga位上的直接C-H键活化，而不是在沸石酸性位上形成碳正离子中间体。

C-H活化步骤被提出作为速率决定步骤(RDS)，因为它涉及断裂强C-H键，这通常比机理中的其他步骤需要更多能量。

烷基机理适用于不同的Ga物种结构如下：

1. 孤立的Ga+离子：这些被认为是PDH的主要活性位，遵循上述机理。

2. 二氢化钆离子(GaH2+)：尽管先前被认为是活性位，但证据表明它们不参与丙烷活化。它们在惰性气体下缓慢分解，在丙烷流下迅速被烷基钆物种取代。

3. 双核钆物种：这些氧化物种被还原形成孤立的Ga+离子，然后参与烷基机理。

烷基机理解释了在反应条件下观察到的稳定烷基钆物种的形成，并解释了在丙烷存在下二氢化钆物种被烷基钆离子快速取代的现象。这一机理与实验观察一致，比先前提出的涉及二氢化钆离子作为活性位的假说更准确地描述了钆基催化剂上的PDH过程。

The alkyl mechanism for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) on gallium-based catalysts involves several key steps:

1. Propane activation: The initial step involves the adsorption and activation of propane on the gallium active site (ZGa+). This results in the formation of an alkyl-hydride intermediate (ZGa+H(C3H7)).

2. Dehydrogenation: The alkyl-hydride intermediate then undergoes dehydrogenation, releasing hydrogen and forming propene. This step regenerates the original gallium active site.

3. Alkyl rearrangement: Alternatively, the alkyl-hydride intermediate can undergo rearrangement to form a more stable alkylgallium species (ZGa+(CH3)(C2H5)).

The alkyl mechanism differs from the carbenium mechanism primarily in the nature of the intermediates formed. While the carbenium mechanism involves the formation of carbocation intermediates, the alkyl mechanism proceeds through alkyl-metal intermediates.

The C-H activation step is proposed as the rate-determining step (RDS) in the alkyl mechanism because it involves breaking a strong C-H bond, which typically requires more energy compared to subsequent steps. This step determines the overall rate of the reaction.

The alkyl mechanism applies to different Ga species structures, but the reactivity may vary depending on the specific gallium species present. For example, the study shows that dihydridogallium ions (GaH2+) are not the active species for alkane activation, contrary to some previous proposals. Instead, isolated Ga(I) species appear to be more relevant for the alkyl mechanism.

The mechanism also explains the competition between hydrogen and propane for active sites, as observed in the study. This competition affects the overall reaction kinetics and product distribution in PDH reactions.

镓基催化剂上丙烷脱氢(PDH)的烷基机理包括几个关键步骤：

1. 丙烷活化：初始步骤涉及丙烷在镓活性位点(ZGa+)上的吸附和活化。这导致形成烷基-氢化物中间体(ZGa+H(C3H7))。

2. 脱氢：烷基-氢化物中间体随后经历脱氢，释放氢气并形成丙烯。这一步骤重新生成原始的镓活性位点。

3. 烷基重排：另外，烷基-氢化物中间体可以进行重排，形成更稳定的烷基镓物种(ZGa+(CH3)(C2H5))。

烷基机理与碳正离子机理的主要区别在于形成的中间体性质不同。碳正离子机理涉及碳正离子中间体的形成，而烷基机理则通过烷基-金属中间体进行。

C-H活化步骤被提出为烷基机理中的速率决定步骤(RDS)，因为它涉及断裂强C-H键，这通常比后续步骤需要更多能量。这一步骤决定了反应的整体速率。

烷基机理适用于不同的Ga物种结构，但反应性可能因存在的特定镓物种而异。例如，研究表明二氢化镓离子(GaH2+)并不是烷烃活化的活性物种，这与一些先前的提议相反。相反，单独的Ga(I)物种似乎与烷基机理更相关。

该机理还解释了研究中观察到的氢气和丙烷对活性位点的竞争。这种竞争影响PDH反应的整体反应动力学和产物分布。

The alkyl mechanism for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) on gallium-based catalysts involves several key steps:

1. Propane activation: The reaction begins with propane interacting with a reduced gallium species (Ga+) to form an alkyl-hydride intermediate.

2. C-H bond cleavage: The alkyl-hydride intermediate undergoes C-H bond cleavage, leading to the formation of propene and hydrogen.

3. Rearrangement: Alternatively, the alkyl-hydride intermediate can rearrange to form a more stable alkylgallium species.

4. Product desorption: The final step involves the desorption of propene and hydrogen from the catalyst surface.

The alkyl mechanism differs from the carbenium mechanism in that it does not involve the formation of carbocations. Instead, it proposes the formation of alkyl intermediates directly bonded to the gallium species.

The C-H activation step is often proposed as the rate-determining step (RDS) because it involves breaking a strong C-H bond, which typically requires more energy compared to other steps in the reaction. This step is crucial for the overall reaction rate and determines the efficiency of the catalyst.

The alkyl mechanism applies to different Ga species structures, including isolated Ga+ ions and dihydridogallium species. However, the research suggests that dihydridogallium ions are not the active species for propane activation, as they are rapidly replaced by alkylgallium ions under propane flow. The mechanism appears to be more applicable to isolated Ga+ species, which can form stable alkyl intermediates during the reaction.

It's important to note that the exact nature of the active gallium species and the detailed mechanism may vary depending on the specific catalyst composition and reaction conditions. The proposed alkyl mechanism provides a framework for understanding propane dehydrogenation on gallium-based catalysts, but further research may reveal additional complexities or variations in the reaction pathway.

在镓基催化剂上进行丙烷脱氢（PDH）的烷基机理包括几个关键步骤：

1. 丙烷活化：反应始于丙烷与还原态镓物种（Ga+）相互作用，形成烷基-氢化物中间体。

2. C-H键断裂：烷基-氢化物中间体发生C-H键断裂，生成丙烯和氢气。

3. 重排：或者，烷基-氢化物中间体可以重排形成更稳定的烷基镓物种。

4. 产物脱附：最后一步涉及丙烯和氢气从催化剂表面脱附。

烷基机理与碳正离子机理的不同之处在于它不涉及碳正离子的形成。相反，它提出了直接与镓物种键合的烷基中间体的形成。

C-H活化步骤通常被提出为速率决定步骤（RDS），因为它涉及断裂强C-H键，这通常比反应中的其他步骤需要更多能量。这一步骤对整体反应速率至关重要，并决定了催化剂的效率。

烷基机理适用于不同的Ga物种结构，包括孤立的Ga+离子和二氢化镓物种。然而，研究表明，二氢化镓离子不是丙烷活化的活性物种，因为在丙烷流下它们会被迅速替换为烷基镓离子。该机理似乎更适用于孤立的Ga+物种，这些物种在反应过程中可以形成稳定的烷基中间体。

值得注意的是，活性镓物种的确切性质和详细机理可能会随着特定催化剂组成和反应条件的不同而变化。提出的烷基机理为理解镓基催化剂上的丙烷脱氢提供了一个框架，但进一步的研究可能会揭示反应途径的额外复杂性或变化。

The alkyl mechanism for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) on gallium-based catalysts involves several key steps:

1. Initial propane activation: Propane interacts with an isolated Ga+ site to form an alkyl-hydride intermediate (ZGa+H(C3H7)).

2. Dehydrogenation: This intermediate can undergo β-hydride elimination to produce propylene and hydrogen, regenerating the Ga+ site.

3. Rearrangement: Alternatively, the alkyl-hydride intermediate can rearrange to form a more stable alkylgallium species (ZGa+(CH3)(C2H5)).

The alkyl mechanism differs from the carbenium mechanism in that it involves direct C-H bond activation by the gallium site, rather than proceeding through a carbocation intermediate. The C-H activation step is proposed as the rate-determining step (RDS) because it involves breaking a strong C-H bond and forming new Ga-H and Ga-C bonds, which is energetically demanding.

This mechanism applies to different Ga species structures, particularly isolated Ga+ sites. The literature suggests that dihydridogallium (GaH2+) species, while observable under hydrogen, are not the active sites for alkane activation. When exposed to propane, these dihydrido species are rapidly replaced by alkylgallium ions, indicating that the alkyl mechanism is more relevant under reaction conditions.

The alkyl mechanism explains the observed formation of stable alkylgallium species during propane dehydrogenation and accounts for the competition between hydrogen and propane for active sites. It also provides a rationale for the inhibition of dehydrogenation reactions by increasing hydrogen partial pressure, as hydrogen can reverse some of the steps in the mechanism.

3. 重排：另外，烷基-氢化物中间体可以重排形成更稳定的烷基镓物种(ZGa+(CH3)(C2H5))。

烷基机理与碳正离子机理的不同之处在于，它涉及镓位点直接活化C-H键，而不是通过碳正离子中间体进行。C-H活化步骤被提出为速率决定步骤(RDS)，因为它涉及打破强C-H键并形成新的Ga-H和Ga-C键，这在能量上是要求较高的。

这种机理适用于不同的Ga物种结构，特别是孤立的Ga+位点。文献表明，虽然在氢气下可以观察到二氢化镓(GaH2+)物种，但它们不是烷烃活化的活性位点。当暴露于丙烷时，这些二氢化物种迅速被烷基镓离子取代，表明在反应条件下烷基机理更为相关。

烷基机理解释了在丙烷脱氢过程中观察到的稳定烷基镓物种的形成，并说明了氢气和丙烷对活性位点的竞争。它还为增加氢分压抑制脱氢反应提供了理论依据，因为氢气可以逆转机理中的一些步骤。
