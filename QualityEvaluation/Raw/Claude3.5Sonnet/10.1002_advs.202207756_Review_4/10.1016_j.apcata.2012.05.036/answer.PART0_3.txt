[5] "Dihydridogallium ions were observed after reduction in hydrogen, but were slowly decomposed when hydrogen flow was replaced by inert gas. This slow decomposition of the dihydridogallium ions shows that it cannot intermediate hydrogen desorption during the aromatization reaction. However, when hydrogen is replaced by propane, the dihydrido species appear to be rapidly replaced by alkylgallium ions. Under propane flow, dihydridogallium cations were never detected."

The alkyl mechanism for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) on gallium-based catalysts involves several key steps:

1. Propane activation: The reaction begins with propane interacting with a reduced gallium species (Ga+) to form an alkyl-hydride intermediate.

2. C-H bond cleavage: The alkyl-hydride intermediate undergoes C-H bond cleavage, leading to the formation of propene and hydrogen.

3. Rearrangement: Alternatively, the alkyl-hydride intermediate can rearrange to form a more stable alkylgallium species.

4. Product desorption: The final step involves the desorption of propene and hydrogen from the catalyst surface.

The alkyl mechanism differs from the carbenium mechanism in that it does not involve the formation of carbocations. Instead, it proposes the formation of alkyl intermediates directly bonded to the gallium species.

The C-H activation step is often proposed as the rate-determining step (RDS) because it involves breaking a strong C-H bond, which typically requires more energy compared to other steps in the reaction. This step is crucial for the overall reaction rate and determines the efficiency of the catalyst.

The alkyl mechanism applies to different Ga species structures, including isolated Ga+ ions and dihydridogallium species. However, the research suggests that dihydridogallium ions are not the active species for propane activation, as they are rapidly replaced by alkylgallium ions under propane flow. The mechanism appears to be more applicable to isolated Ga+ species, which can form stable alkyl intermediates during the reaction.

It's important to note that the exact nature of the active gallium species and the detailed mechanism may vary depending on the specific catalyst composition and reaction conditions. The proposed alkyl mechanism provides a framework for understanding propane dehydrogenation on gallium-based catalysts, but further research may reveal additional complexities or variations in the reaction pathway.

在镓基催化剂上进行丙烷脱氢（PDH）的烷基机理包括几个关键步骤：

1. 丙烷活化：反应始于丙烷与还原态镓物种（Ga+）相互作用，形成烷基-氢化物中间体。

2. C-H键断裂：烷基-氢化物中间体发生C-H键断裂，生成丙烯和氢气。

3. 重排：或者，烷基-氢化物中间体可以重排形成更稳定的烷基镓物种。

4. 产物脱附：最后一步涉及丙烯和氢气从催化剂表面脱附。

烷基机理与碳正离子机理的不同之处在于它不涉及碳正离子的形成。相反，它提出了直接与镓物种键合的烷基中间体的形成。

C-H活化步骤通常被提出为速率决定步骤（RDS），因为它涉及断裂强C-H键，这通常比反应中的其他步骤需要更多能量。这一步骤对整体反应速率至关重要，并决定了催化剂的效率。

烷基机理适用于不同的Ga物种结构，包括孤立的Ga+离子和二氢化镓物种。然而，研究表明，二氢化镓离子不是丙烷活化的活性物种，因为在丙烷流下它们会被迅速替换为烷基镓离子。该机理似乎更适用于孤立的Ga+物种，这些物种在反应过程中可以形成稳定的烷基中间体。

值得注意的是，活性镓物种的确切性质和详细机理可能会随着特定催化剂组成和反应条件的不同而变化。提出的烷基机理为理解镓基催化剂上的丙烷脱氢提供了一个框架，但进一步的研究可能会揭示反应途径的额外复杂性或变化。
