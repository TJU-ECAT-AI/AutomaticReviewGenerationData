[6] "However, when hydrogen is replaced by propane, the dihydrido species appear to be rapidly replaced by alkylgallium ions. Under propane flow, dihydridogallium cations were never detected. These facts show that it cannot be the active site for alkane activation, as proposed by some investigators."

The alkyl mechanism for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) on gallium-based catalysts involves several key steps:

1. Initial propane activation: Propane adsorbs on the Ga+ active site, forming a Ga-alkyl intermediate (ZGa+H(C3H7)).

2. C-H bond activation: The Ga-alkyl species undergoes C-H bond cleavage, releasing H2 and forming propene (C3H6).

3. Product desorption: Propene desorbs from the catalyst surface, regenerating the Ga+ active site.

4. Side reactions: The Ga-alkyl intermediate can also undergo rearrangement to form a methylethylgallium species (ZGa+(CH3)(C2H5)).

The alkyl mechanism differs from the carbenium mechanism in that it involves direct C-H bond activation on the Ga site, rather than forming a carbocation intermediate on the zeolite acid sites.

The C-H activation step is proposed as the rate-determining step (RDS) because it involves breaking a strong C-H bond, which typically requires more energy than other steps in the mechanism.

The alkyl mechanism applies to different Ga species structures as follows:

1. Isolated Ga+ ions: These are considered the primary active sites for PDH, following the mechanism described above.

2. Dihydridogallium ions (GaH2+): Although previously thought to be active sites, the evidence suggests they are not involved in propane activation. They decompose slowly under inert gas and are rapidly replaced by alkylgallium species under propane flow.

3. Binuclear gallium species: These oxidic species are reduced to form isolated Ga+ ions, which then participate in the alkyl mechanism.

The alkyl mechanism explains the observed formation of stable alkylgallium species under reaction conditions and accounts for the rapid replacement of dihydridogallium species by alkylgallium ions in the presence of propane. This mechanism is consistent with the experimental observations and provides a more accurate description of the PDH process on gallium-based catalysts than previous proposals involving dihydridogallium ions as active sites.

钆基催化剂上丙烷脱氢(PDH)的烷基机理涉及几个关键步骤：

1. 初始丙烷活化：丙烷在Ga+活性位上吸附，形成Ga-烷基中间体(ZGa+H(C3H7))。

2. C-H键活化：Ga-烷基物种经历C-H键断裂，释放H2并形成丙烯(C3H6)。

3. 产物脱附：丙烯从催化剂表面脱附，重新生成Ga+活性位。

4. 副反应：Ga-烷基中间体还可以重排形成甲基乙基钆物种(ZGa+(CH3)(C2H5))。

烷基机理与碳正离子机理的不同之处在于，它涉及Ga位上的直接C-H键活化，而不是在沸石酸性位上形成碳正离子中间体。

C-H活化步骤被提出作为速率决定步骤(RDS)，因为它涉及断裂强C-H键，这通常比机理中的其他步骤需要更多能量。

烷基机理适用于不同的Ga物种结构如下：

1. 孤立的Ga+离子：这些被认为是PDH的主要活性位，遵循上述机理。

2. 二氢化钆离子(GaH2+)：尽管先前被认为是活性位，但证据表明它们不参与丙烷活化。它们在惰性气体下缓慢分解，在丙烷流下迅速被烷基钆物种取代。

3. 双核钆物种：这些氧化物种被还原形成孤立的Ga+离子，然后参与烷基机理。

烷基机理解释了在反应条件下观察到的稳定烷基钆物种的形成，并解释了在丙烷存在下二氢化钆物种被烷基钆离子快速取代的现象。这一机理与实验观察一致，比先前提出的涉及二氢化钆离子作为活性位的假说更准确地描述了钆基催化剂上的PDH过程。
