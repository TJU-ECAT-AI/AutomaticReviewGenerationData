Unfortunately, I cannot provide a comprehensive explanation of the alkyl mechanism in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions on gallium-based catalysts or compare it to the carbenium mechanism based on the given literature. The provided text appears to be only the title and some basic publication information for a research article. It does not contain any detailed information about reaction mechanisms, rate-determining steps, or different gallium species structures. To accurately answer these questions, we would need access to the full text of the article or additional relevant literature on the topic.

很遗憾,我无法根据给定的文献对镓基催化剂上丙烷脱氢(PDH)反应的烷基机理进行全面解释,也无法将其与碳正离子机理进行比较。所提供的文本似乎只是一篇研究文章的标题和一些基本出版信息。它不包含有关反应机理、速率决定步骤或不同镓物种结构的任何详细信息。要准确回答这些问题,我们需要获取该文章的全文或其他相关文献。
