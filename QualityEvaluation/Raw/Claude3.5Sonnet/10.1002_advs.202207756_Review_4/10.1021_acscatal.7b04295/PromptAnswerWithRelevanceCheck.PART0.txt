Read the questions and answers provided below. First, critically assess the overall relevance of the answers provided to the set of questions asked.

If, upon your assessment, you find that the answers do not contain information that is relevant to the questions asked, stop your review process immediately and respond with a single sentence: "※※※※※※※The provided answers are not relevant to the questions.※※※※※※※". Do not provide any additional explanation or background information, only this sentence should be given as a response in case of irrelevant answers.

If, however, the answers are relevant to the questions asked, proceed to compile answers for each question according to the instructions below. Ensure to aggregate all the relevant answers from the multiple answer results provided in the document, and organize them sequentially by their order number, compiling the corresponding quotes, English answers, and Chinese answers for each question.

If the provided answers' quotes are not differentiated by question, ensure to break them down and assign the quotes to each respective question, outputting them separately within each question's section.

To provide a comprehensive review, differentiate the responses into quotes, English answers, and Chinese answers for each question based on the details given in the 'Answer' XML tags. Structure your review using the XML format showcased below if the answers are relevant to the questions asked:

<questions>

Provide a comprehensive explanation of the alkyl mechanism in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions on gallium-based catalysts, detailing its key steps from initial propane activation to product formation. Compare this mechanism to the carbenium mechanism, discuss why the CH activation step is proposed as the rate-determining step (RDS), and explain how the alkyl mechanism applies to different Ga species structures.

I apologize, but I cannot provide a comprehensive explanation of the alkyl mechanism in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions on gallium-based catalysts or compare it to the carbenium mechanism based on the given literature. The provided text appears to be only the title, authors, and publication information of a research article, without any detailed content about reaction mechanisms. There is insufficient information to address the specific questions about key steps, rate-determining steps, or how the mechanism applies to different Ga species structures. To properly answer these questions, we would need access to the full text of the article or additional relevant scientific literature on propane dehydrogenation mechanisms.

我很抱歉，但我无法根据给定的文献对镓基催化剂上丙烷脱氢(PDH)反应的烷基机理进行全面解释，也无法将其与碳正离子机理进行比较。提供的文本似乎只包含研究文章的标题、作者和出版信息，没有关于反应机理的详细内容。没有足够的信息来解答关于关键步骤、速率决定步骤或机理如何应用于不同镓物种结构的具体问题。要正确回答这些问题，我们需要获取该文章的全文或其他有关丙烷脱氢机理的相关科学文献。

Unfortunately, I do not have enough relevant information from the given literature to provide a comprehensive answer to the question about the alkyl mechanism in propane dehydrogenation reactions. The literature snippet provided contains only the title, authors, and publication details of a research article, without any content about reaction mechanisms or gallium-based catalysts. Therefore, I cannot extract relevant quotes or provide a detailed answer based solely on this limited information.
