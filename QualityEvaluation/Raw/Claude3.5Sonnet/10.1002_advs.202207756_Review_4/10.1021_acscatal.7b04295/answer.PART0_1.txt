Unfortunately, I cannot provide a comprehensive explanation of the alkyl mechanism in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions on gallium-based catalysts or compare it to the carbenium mechanism based on the given literature. The provided text appears to be only a title and bibliographic information for a research article, without any detailed content about reaction mechanisms. To accurately answer the questions about the alkyl mechanism, its key steps, comparison with the carbenium mechanism, the rate-determining step, and how it applies to different Ga species structures, we would need access to the full text of the article or additional relevant literature on this topic.

很遗憾,根据所给的文献,我无法对镓基催化剂上丙烷脱氢(PDH)反应的烷基机理进行全面解释,也无法将其与碳正离子机理进行比较。提供的文本似乎只是一篇研究文章的标题和书目信息,没有关于反应机理的详细内容。要准确回答有关烷基机理、其关键步骤、与碳正离子机理的比较、速率决定步骤以及它如何应用于不同镓物种结构的问题,我们需要获取该文章的全文或其他相关文献。
