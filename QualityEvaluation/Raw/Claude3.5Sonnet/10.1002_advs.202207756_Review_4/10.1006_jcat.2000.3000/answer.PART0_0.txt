The given literature does not contain information about the alkyl mechanism in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions on gallium-based catalysts. The document mainly focuses on the reactions of propane on Mo2C catalysts supported on ZSM-5 and SiO2. It does not discuss gallium-based catalysts or the alkyl mechanism for PDH reactions. Therefore, I cannot provide a comprehensive explanation of the alkyl mechanism, compare it to the carbenium mechanism, discuss the CH activation step as the rate-determining step, or explain how the alkyl mechanism applies to different Ga species structures based on the information given in this document.

给定的文献中不包含关于镓基催化剂上丙烷脱氢(PDH)反应的烷基机理的信息。该文档主要集中在ZSM-5和SiO2负载的Mo2C催化剂上的丙烷反应。它没有讨论镓基催化剂或PDH反应的烷基机理。因此,根据本文档中给出的信息,我无法全面解释烷基机理,将其与碳正离子机理进行比较,讨论CH活化步骤作为速率决定步骤,或解释烷基机理如何适用于不同的Ga物种结构。
