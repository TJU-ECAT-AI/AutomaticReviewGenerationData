[1] "Van Santen et al have confirmed by modeling calculation the mechanism that the alkane activation on Ga/HZSM-5 occurs by an alkyl mechanism and requires the concomitant participation of the zeolite oxygen (Lewis base) together with the gallium atom (Lewis Acid), and this active center is called bi-site (Scheme 1)"

[2] "Recently, Schreiber et al [36], proposed that the active sites for propane dehydrogenation in Ga/H-ZSM-5 with a Si/Al ratio of 50 is a Lewis-Brnsted acid pairs (scheme 2)."

[3] "We suggest that the dehydrogenation of the light alkanes requires strong LAS. On the hierarchical bifunctional catalysts which have only weak Lewis acid sites (Fig. SI.1), the dehydrogenation activity is low, while on bifunctional microporous catalysts LAS generated by the Ga species are slightly stronger, which coincides with a higher dehydrogenation activity (Fig. 9b)"

The alkyl mechanism for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) on gallium-based catalysts involves several key steps:

1. Initial activation: Propane is activated at a bi-site consisting of a gallium atom (Lewis acid) and a neighboring zeolite oxygen (Lewis base).

2. C-H bond cleavage: The bi-site facilitates the breaking of a C-H bond in propane, forming a propyl intermediate bound to the gallium.

3. β-hydride elimination: A hydrogen atom is transferred from the propyl group to the catalyst surface, forming propene.

4. Product desorption: The propene molecule desorbs from the catalyst surface.

5. Catalyst regeneration: The hydrogen atoms on the surface recombine and desorb as H2, regenerating the active site.

The alkyl mechanism differs from the carbenium mechanism, which involves the formation of a carbocation intermediate. In the alkyl mechanism, the initial C-H activation step is proposed as the rate-determining step (RDS) because it requires overcoming the highest energy barrier in the reaction pathway.

The alkyl mechanism applies to different Ga species structures, including isolated Ga3+ ions, GaO+ species, and small Ga2O3 clusters. However, the specific nature of the active site can vary depending on the Ga loading and preparation method. For example, Lewis-Brønsted acid pairs have been proposed as active sites in some Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts.

The strength of the Lewis acid sites (LAS) plays a crucial role in the dehydrogenation activity. Stronger LAS, typically found in microporous Ga/ZSM-5 catalysts, exhibit higher dehydrogenation activity compared to weaker LAS present in hierarchical catalysts. This suggests that the alkyl mechanism is more efficient on stronger Lewis acid sites, which can better facilitate the initial C-H activation step.

镓基催化剂上丙烷脱氢(PDH)的烷基机理包括几个关键步骤：

1. 初始活化：丙烷在由镓原子(Lewis酸)和相邻的沸石氧(Lewis碱)组成的双位点上被活化。

2. C-H键断裂：双位点促进丙烷中C-H键的断裂，形成与镓结合的丙基中间体。

3. β-氢消除：氢原子从丙基转移到催化剂表面，形成丙烯。

4. 产物脱附：丙烯分子从催化剂表面脱附。

5. 催化剂再生：表面上的氢原子重新结合并以H2形式脱附，重新生成活性位点。

烷基机理与碳正离子机理不同，后者涉及碳正离子中间体的形成。在烷基机理中，初始C-H活化步骤被提议为速率决定步骤(RDS)，因为它需要克服反应路径中最高的能量障碍。

烷基机理适用于不同的Ga物种结构，包括孤立的Ga3+离子、GaO+物种和小的Ga2O3簇。然而，活性位点的具体性质可能因Ga负载量和制备方法而异。例如，在某些Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂中，Lewis-Brønsted酸对被提议为活性位点。

Lewis酸位点(LAS)的强度在脱氢活性中起着关键作用。通常在微孔Ga/ZSM-5催化剂中发现的较强LAS，与存在于分级催化剂中的较弱LAS相比，表现出更高的脱氢活性。这表明烷基机理在较强的Lewis酸位点上更有效，这些位点能够更好地促进初始C-H活化步骤。
