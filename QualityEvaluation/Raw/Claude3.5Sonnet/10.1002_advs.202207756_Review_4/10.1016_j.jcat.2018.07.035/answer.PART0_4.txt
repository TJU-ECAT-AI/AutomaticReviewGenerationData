[1] "Van Santen et al have confirmed by modeling calculation the mechanism that the alkane activation on Ga/HZSM-5 occurs by an alkyl mechanism and requires the concomitant participation of the zeolite oxygen (Lewis base) together with the gallium atom (Lewis Acid), and this active center is called bi-site"

[2] "Recently, Schreiber et al [36], proposed that the active sites for propane dehydrogenation in Ga/H-ZSM-5 with a Si/Al ratio of 50 is a Lewis-Brnsted acid pairs"

[3] "We suggest that the dehydrogenation of the light alkanes requires strong LAS. On the hierarchical bifunctional catalysts which have only weak Lewis acid sites (Fig. SI.1), the dehydrogenation activity is low, while on bifunctional microporous catalysts LAS generated by the Ga species are slightly stronger, which coincides with a higher dehydrogenation activity"

The alkyl mechanism for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) on gallium-based catalysts involves several key steps:

1. Initial activation: Propane is activated at a bi-site consisting of a gallium atom (Lewis acid) and a neighboring zeolite oxygen (Lewis base). 

2. C-H bond cleavage: The bi-site facilitates the breaking of a C-H bond in propane, forming a propyl intermediate and a proton.

3. Propyl intermediate formation: The propyl group remains bound to the gallium site.

4. β-hydride elimination: A β-hydrogen is eliminated from the propyl group, forming propene.

5. Product desorption: Propene desorbs from the catalyst surface.

6. Catalyst regeneration: The protons recombine to form H2, regenerating the active site.

The alkyl mechanism differs from the carbenium mechanism, which involves the formation of a carbocation intermediate. In the alkyl mechanism, no carbocation is formed.

The C-H activation step is proposed as the rate-determining step (RDS) because it involves breaking a strong C-H bond and requires the most energy. This step determines the overall reaction rate.

The alkyl mechanism applies to different Ga species structures, but the activity depends on the strength of the Lewis acid sites (LAS). Microporous catalysts with stronger Ga-generated LAS show higher dehydrogenation activity compared to hierarchical catalysts with weaker LAS. This suggests that the alkyl mechanism is more efficient on stronger Lewis acid sites, which can more effectively activate the C-H bond in propane.

镓基催化剂上丙烷脱氢(PDH)的烷基机理包括几个关键步骤：

1. 初始活化：丙烷在由镓原子(Lewis酸)和相邻的沸石氧(Lewis碱)组成的双位点上被活化。

2. C-H键断裂：双位点促进丙烷中C-H键的断裂，形成丙基中间体和质子。

3. 丙基中间体形成：丙基保持与镓位点结合。

4. β-氢消除：从丙基中消除β-氢，形成丙烯。

5. 产物脱附：丙烯从催化剂表面脱附。

6. 催化剂再生：质子重新结合形成H2，再生活性位点。

烷基机理与碳正离子机理不同，后者涉及碳正离子中间体的形成。在烷基机理中，不形成碳正离子。

C-H活化步骤被提出为速率决定步骤(RDS)，因为它涉及断裂强C-H键，需要最多的能量。这一步骤决定了整体反应速率。

烷基机理适用于不同的Ga物种结构，但活性取决于Lewis酸位点(LAS)的强度。与具有较弱LAS的多级催化剂相比，具有较强Ga生成LAS的微孔催化剂显示出更高的脱氢活性。这表明烷基机理在较强的Lewis酸位点上更有效，可以更有效地活化丙烷中的C-H键。
