[1] "Van Santen et al have confirmed by modeling calculation the mechanism that the alkane activation on Ga/HZSM-5 occurs by an alkyl mechanism and requires the concomitant participation of the zeolite oxygen (Lewis base) together with the gallium atom (Lewis Acid), and this active center is called bi-site (Scheme 1)"

[2] "Recently, Schreiber et al [36], proposed that the active sites for propane dehydrogenation in Ga/H-ZSM-5 with a Si/Al ratio of 50 is a Lewis-Brnsted acid pairs (scheme 2)."

[3] "We suggest that the dehydrogenation of the light alkanes requires strong LAS. On the hierarchical bifunctional catalysts which have only weak Lewis acid sites (Fig. SI.1), the dehydrogenation activity is low, while on bifunctional microporous catalysts LAS generated by the Ga species are slightly stronger, which coincides with a higher dehydrogenation activity (Fig. 9b)"

The alkyl mechanism for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) on gallium-based catalysts involves several key steps:

1. Initial activation: Propane is activated at a bi-site consisting of a gallium atom (Lewis acid) and a zeolite oxygen (Lewis base). This requires the concomitant participation of both sites.

2. C-H bond activation: The C-H bond of propane is activated, likely forming a Ga-alkyl intermediate. This step is proposed to be the rate-determining step (RDS) due to the high energy required to break the C-H bond.

3. β-hydride elimination: The Ga-alkyl intermediate undergoes β-hydride elimination to form propene and a Ga-H species.

4. Product desorption: Propene desorbs from the catalyst surface.

5. Catalyst regeneration: The Ga-H species releases hydrogen, regenerating the active Ga site.

Compared to the carbenium mechanism, which involves the formation of a carbocation intermediate, the alkyl mechanism proposes a more direct route for C-H activation without the need for a highly unstable carbocation. The C-H activation step is considered the RDS because it requires the most energy and determines the overall reaction rate.

The alkyl mechanism can apply to different Ga species structures:

1. Isolated Ga3+ ions: These can act as Lewis acid sites in conjunction with nearby zeolite oxygen.

2. GaO+ species: These can form Lewis-Brønsted acid pairs with nearby zeolitic protons, as proposed by Schreiber et al.

3. Reduced Ga species: These may have enhanced Lewis acidity, facilitating C-H activation.

The strength of the Lewis acid sites (LAS) generated by Ga species plays a crucial role in the dehydrogenation activity. Stronger LAS, typically found in microporous catalysts, lead to higher dehydrogenation activity compared to weaker LAS in hierarchical catalysts.

镓基催化剂上丙烷脱氢(PDH)的烷基机理包括几个关键步骤：

1. 初始活化：丙烷在由镓原子(Lewis酸)和沸石氧(Lewis碱)组成的双位点上被活化。这需要两个位点的共同参与。

2. C-H键活化：丙烷的C-H键被活化，可能形成Ga-烷基中间体。由于断裂C-H键需要高能量，这一步被认为是速率决定步骤(RDS)。

3. β-氢消除：Ga-烷基中间体经过β-氢消除形成丙烯和Ga-H物种。

4. 产物脱附：丙烯从催化剂表面脱附。

5. 催化剂再生：Ga-H物种释放氢气，再生活性Ga位点。

与涉及形成碳正离子中间体的碳正离子机理相比，烷基机理提出了一种更直接的C-H活化路径，无需高度不稳定的碳正离子。C-H活化步骤被认为是RDS，因为它需要最多的能量并决定了整体反应速率。

烷基机理可以应用于不同的Ga物种结构：

1. 孤立的Ga3+离子：这些可以与附近的沸石氧一起作为Lewis酸位点。

2. GaO+物种：这些可以与附近的沸石质子形成Lewis-Brønsted酸对，如Schreiber等人所提出的。

3. 还原态Ga物种：这些可能具有增强的Lewis�idity，促进C-H活化。

Ga物种产生的Lewis酸位点(LAS)强度在脱氢活性中起着关键作用。通常在微孔催化剂中发现的较强LAS导致较高的脱氢活性，相比之下，分级催化剂中的较弱LAS活性较低。
