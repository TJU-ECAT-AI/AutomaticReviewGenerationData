[1] "Van Santen et al have confirmed by modeling calculation the mechanism that the alkane activation on Ga/HZSM-5 occurs by an alkyl mechanism and requires the concomitant participation of the zeolite oxygen (Lewis base) together with the gallium atom (Lewis Acid), and this active center is called bi-site (Scheme 1)"

[2] "Recently, Schreiber et al [36], proposed that the active sites for propane dehydrogenation in Ga/H-ZSM-5 with a Si/Al ratio of 50 is a Lewis-Brnsted acid pairs (scheme 2)."

[3] "We suggest that the dehydrogenation of the light alkanes requires strong LAS. On the hierarchical bifunctional catalysts which have only weak Lewis acid sites (Fig. SI.1), the dehydrogenation activity is low, while on bifunctional microporous catalysts LAS generated by the Ga species are slightly stronger, which coincides with a higher dehydrogenation activity (Fig. 9b)"

The alkyl mechanism for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) on gallium-based catalysts involves several key steps:

1. Propane activation: The alkane is activated by a bi-site consisting of a gallium atom (Lewis acid) and zeolite oxygen (Lewis base). This requires the concomitant participation of both sites.

2. C-H bond cleavage: The bi-site facilitates the breaking of a C-H bond in propane, forming an alkyl intermediate.

3. β-hydride elimination: A hydrogen atom is abstracted from the alkyl intermediate, forming propene.

4. Product desorption: The propene product desorbs from the catalyst surface.

5. Catalyst regeneration: The hydrogen atoms recombine and desorb as H2, regenerating the active site.

The alkyl mechanism differs from the carbenium mechanism in that it does not involve the formation of a carbocation intermediate. Instead, it proceeds through a more direct route involving the alkyl species.

The C-H activation step is proposed as the rate-determining step (RDS) because it involves breaking a strong C-H bond and requires the precise coordination of the bi-site. This step likely has the highest energy barrier in the overall reaction pathway.

The alkyl mechanism applies to different Ga species structures, but its efficiency depends on the strength of the Lewis acid sites (LAS). Stronger LAS, typically found in microporous Ga/HZSM-5 catalysts, promote higher dehydrogenation activity. In contrast, hierarchical catalysts with weaker LAS show lower activity for light alkane dehydrogenation.

Recent research suggests that the active sites for propane dehydrogenation in Ga/H-ZSM-5 may be Lewis-Brønsted acid pairs, highlighting the complexity and ongoing debate about the exact nature of the active sites in these catalysts.

镓基催化剂上丙烷脱氢(PDH)的烷基机理涉及几个关键步骤：

1. 丙烷活化：烷烃被由镓原子（路易斯酸）和沸石氧（路易斯碱）组成的双位点活化。这需要两个位点的共同参与。

2. C-H键断裂：双位点促进丙烷中C-H键的断裂，形成烷基中间体。

3. β-氢消除：从烷基中间体中抽取一个氢原子，形成丙烯。

4. 产物脱附：丙烯产物从催化剂表面脱附。

5. 催化剂再生：氢原子重新结合并作为H2脱附，重新生成活性位点。

烷基机理与碳正离子机理的不同之处在于它不涉及碳正离子中间体的形成。相反，它通过涉及烷基物种的更直接途径进行。

C-H活化步骤被提出为速率决定步骤（RDS），因为它涉及强C-H键的断裂，并需要双位点的精确配合。这一步骤在整个反应路径中可能具有最高的能量障碍。

烷基机理适用于不同的Ga物种结构，但其效率取决于路易斯酸位点（LAS）的强度。通常在微孔Ga/HZSM-5催化剂中发现的较强LAS促进更高的脱氢活性。相比之下，具有较弱LAS的分级催化剂对轻烷烃脱氢的活性较低。

最近的研究表明，Ga/H-ZSM-5中丙烷脱氢的活性位点可能是路易斯-布朗斯特酸对，这突出了这些催化剂中活性位点确切性质的复杂性和持续争论。
