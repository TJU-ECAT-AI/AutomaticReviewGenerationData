[1] "Van Santen et al have confirmed by modeling calculation the mechanism that the alkane activation on Ga/HZSM-5 occurs by an alkyl mechanism and requires the concomitant participation of the zeolite oxygen (Lewis base) together with the gallium atom (Lewis Acid), and this active center is called bi-site (Scheme 1)"

[2] "Recently, Schreiber et al [36], proposed that the active sites for propane dehydrogenation in Ga/H-ZSM-5 with a Si/Al ratio of 50 is a Lewis-Brnsted acid pairs (scheme 2)."

[3] "We suggest that the dehydrogenation of the light alkanes requires strong LAS. On the hierarchical bifunctional catalysts which have only weak Lewis acid sites (Fig. SI.1), the dehydrogenation activity is low, while on bifunctional microporous catalysts LAS generated by the Ga species are slightly stronger, which coincides with a higher dehydrogenation activity (Fig. 9b)"

The alkyl mechanism for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) on gallium-based catalysts involves several key steps:

1. Initial activation: Propane is activated at a bi-site consisting of a gallium atom (Lewis acid) and a neighboring zeolite oxygen (Lewis base). 

2. C-H bond cleavage: The C-H bond of propane is cleaved heterolytically, forming a Ga-alkyl intermediate and a proton bound to the zeolite oxygen.

3. β-hydride elimination: A β-hydrogen from the alkyl group is transferred to the gallium, forming a Ga-H species and releasing propene.

4. Product desorption: Propene desorbs from the catalyst surface.

5. Catalyst regeneration: The Ga-H species reacts with the proton on the zeolite oxygen, releasing H2 and regenerating the active site.

Compared to the carbenium mechanism, which involves the formation of a carbocation intermediate, the alkyl mechanism proceeds through a more stable alkyl intermediate. The C-H activation step is proposed as the rate-determining step (RDS) because it involves breaking a strong C-H bond and requires the precise orientation of propane at the bi-site.

The alkyl mechanism applies to different Ga species structures, but the activity depends on the strength of the Lewis acid sites (LAS). Microporous Ga/HZSM-5 catalysts with stronger LAS show higher dehydrogenation activity compared to hierarchical catalysts with weaker LAS. This suggests that the strength of the Ga-O pair is crucial for efficient C-H activation.

Recent research has proposed that the active sites in Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts may be Lewis-Brønsted acid pairs rather than purely Lewis acid sites. This highlights the complexity of the active site structure and the potential synergy between different acid sites in the catalyst.

The alkyl mechanism explains the observed dependence of PDH activity on both the dehydrogenating function (Ga sites) and the acidic properties of the catalyst. The balance between these two functions is critical for optimal catalyst performance in propane aromatization reactions.

镓基催化剂上丙烷脱氢(PDH)的烷基机理包括几个关键步骤：

1. 初始活化：丙烷在由镓原子（Lewis酸）和相邻的沸石氧（Lewis碱）组成的双位点上被活化。

2. C-H键断裂：丙烷的C-H键发生异裂，形成Ga-烷基中间体和与沸石氧结合的质子。

3. β-氢消除：烷基基团的β-氢转移到镓上，形成Ga-H物种并释放丙烯。

4. 产物脱附：丙烯从催化剂表面脱附。

5. 催化剂再生：Ga-H物种与沸石氧上的质子反应，释放H2并再生活性位点。

与涉及碳正离子中间体形成的碳正离子机理相比，烷基机理通过更稳定的烷基中间体进行。C-H活化步骤被提出为速率决定步骤(RDS)，因为它涉及断裂强C-H键，并需要丙烷在双位点上精确定向。

烷基机理适用于不同的Ga物种结构，但活性取决于Lewis酸位点(LAS)的强度。具有较强LAS的微孔Ga/HZSM-5催化剂比具有较弱LAS的多级催化剂表现出更高的脱氢活性。这表明Ga-O对的强度对高效C-H活化至关重要。

最近的研究提出，Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂中的活性位点可能是Lewis-Brønsted酸对，而不是纯Lewis酸位点。这突出了活性位点结构的复杂性以及催化剂中不同酸位点之间的潜在协同作用。

烷基机理解释了观察到的PDH活性同时依赖于脱氢功能（Ga位点）和催化剂的酸性质的现象。这两种功能之间的平衡对丙烷芳构化反应中的最佳催化剂性能至关重要。

The alkyl mechanism for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) on gallium-based catalysts involves several key steps:

1. Initial activation: Propane is activated at a bi-site consisting of a gallium atom (Lewis acid) and a neighboring zeolite oxygen (Lewis base).

2. C-H bond cleavage: The bi-site facilitates the breaking of a C-H bond in propane, forming a propyl intermediate bound to the gallium.

3. β-hydride elimination: A hydrogen atom is transferred from the propyl group to the catalyst surface, forming propene.

4. Product desorption: The propene molecule desorbs from the catalyst surface.

5. Catalyst regeneration: The hydrogen atoms on the surface recombine and desorb as H2, regenerating the active site.

The alkyl mechanism differs from the carbenium mechanism, which involves the formation of a carbocation intermediate. In the alkyl mechanism, the initial C-H activation step is proposed as the rate-determining step (RDS) because it requires overcoming the highest energy barrier in the reaction pathway.

The alkyl mechanism applies to different Ga species structures, including isolated Ga3+ ions, GaO+ species, and small Ga2O3 clusters. However, the specific nature of the active site can vary depending on the Ga loading and preparation method. For example, Lewis-Brønsted acid pairs have been proposed as active sites in some Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts.

The strength of the Lewis acid sites (LAS) plays a crucial role in the dehydrogenation activity. Stronger LAS, typically found in microporous Ga/ZSM-5 catalysts, exhibit higher dehydrogenation activity compared to weaker LAS present in hierarchical catalysts. This suggests that the alkyl mechanism is more efficient on stronger Lewis acid sites, which can better facilitate the initial C-H activation step.

1. 初始活化：丙烷在由镓原子(Lewis酸)和相邻的沸石氧(Lewis碱)组成的双位点上被活化。

2. C-H键断裂：双位点促进丙烷中C-H键的断裂，形成与镓结合的丙基中间体。

3. β-氢消除：氢原子从丙基转移到催化剂表面，形成丙烯。

4. 产物脱附：丙烯分子从催化剂表面脱附。

5. 催化剂再生：表面上的氢原子重新结合并以H2形式脱附，重新生成活性位点。

烷基机理与碳正离子机理不同，后者涉及碳正离子中间体的形成。在烷基机理中，初始C-H活化步骤被提议为速率决定步骤(RDS)，因为它需要克服反应路径中最高的能量障碍。

烷基机理适用于不同的Ga物种结构，包括孤立的Ga3+离子、GaO+物种和小的Ga2O3簇。然而，活性位点的具体性质可能因Ga负载量和制备方法而异。例如，在某些Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂中，Lewis-Brønsted酸对被提议为活性位点。

Lewis酸位点(LAS)的强度在脱氢活性中起着关键作用。通常在微孔Ga/ZSM-5催化剂中发现的较强LAS，与存在于分级催化剂中的较弱LAS相比，表现出更高的脱氢活性。这表明烷基机理在较强的Lewis酸位点上更有效，这些位点能够更好地促进初始C-H活化步骤。

The alkyl mechanism for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) on gallium-based catalysts involves several key steps:

1. Initial activation: Propane is activated at a bi-site consisting of a gallium atom (Lewis acid) and a zeolite oxygen (Lewis base). This requires the concomitant participation of both sites.

2. C-H bond activation: The C-H bond of propane is activated, likely forming a Ga-alkyl intermediate. This step is proposed to be the rate-determining step (RDS) due to the high energy required to break the C-H bond.

3. β-hydride elimination: The Ga-alkyl intermediate undergoes β-hydride elimination to form propene and a Ga-H species.

4. Product desorption: Propene desorbs from the catalyst surface.

5. Catalyst regeneration: The Ga-H species releases hydrogen, regenerating the active Ga site.

Compared to the carbenium mechanism, which involves the formation of a carbocation intermediate, the alkyl mechanism proposes a more direct route for C-H activation without the need for a highly unstable carbocation. The C-H activation step is considered the RDS because it requires the most energy and determines the overall reaction rate.

The alkyl mechanism can apply to different Ga species structures:

1. Isolated Ga3+ ions: These can act as Lewis acid sites in conjunction with nearby zeolite oxygen.

2. GaO+ species: These can form Lewis-Brønsted acid pairs with nearby zeolitic protons, as proposed by Schreiber et al.

3. Reduced Ga species: These may have enhanced Lewis acidity, facilitating C-H activation.

The strength of the Lewis acid sites (LAS) generated by Ga species plays a crucial role in the dehydrogenation activity. Stronger LAS, typically found in microporous catalysts, lead to higher dehydrogenation activity compared to weaker LAS in hierarchical catalysts.

与涉及形成碳正离子中间体的碳正离子机理相比，烷基机理提出了一种更直接的C-H活化路径，无需高度不稳定的碳正离子。C-H活化步骤被认为是RDS，因为它需要最多的能量并决定了整体反应速率。

烷基机理可以应用于不同的Ga物种结构：

1. 孤立的Ga3+离子：这些可以与附近的沸石氧一起作为Lewis酸位点。

2. GaO+物种：这些可以与附近的沸石质子形成Lewis-Brønsted酸对，如Schreiber等人所提出的。

3. 还原态Ga物种：这些可能具有增强的Lewis�idity，促进C-H活化。

Ga物种产生的Lewis酸位点(LAS)强度在脱氢活性中起着关键作用。通常在微孔催化剂中发现的较强LAS导致较高的脱氢活性，相比之下，分级催化剂中的较弱LAS活性较低。

The alkyl mechanism for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) on gallium-based catalysts involves several key steps:

1. Propane activation: The alkane is activated by a bi-site consisting of a gallium atom (Lewis acid) and zeolite oxygen (Lewis base). This requires the concomitant participation of both sites.

2. C-H bond cleavage: The bi-site facilitates the breaking of a C-H bond in propane, forming an alkyl intermediate.

3. β-hydride elimination: A hydrogen atom is abstracted from the alkyl intermediate, forming propene.

4. Product desorption: The propene product desorbs from the catalyst surface.

5. Catalyst regeneration: The hydrogen atoms recombine and desorb as H2, regenerating the active site.

The alkyl mechanism differs from the carbenium mechanism in that it does not involve the formation of a carbocation intermediate. Instead, it proceeds through a more direct route involving the alkyl species.

The C-H activation step is proposed as the rate-determining step (RDS) because it involves breaking a strong C-H bond and requires the precise coordination of the bi-site. This step likely has the highest energy barrier in the overall reaction pathway.

The alkyl mechanism applies to different Ga species structures, but its efficiency depends on the strength of the Lewis acid sites (LAS). Stronger LAS, typically found in microporous Ga/HZSM-5 catalysts, promote higher dehydrogenation activity. In contrast, hierarchical catalysts with weaker LAS show lower activity for light alkane dehydrogenation.

Recent research suggests that the active sites for propane dehydrogenation in Ga/H-ZSM-5 may be Lewis-Brønsted acid pairs, highlighting the complexity and ongoing debate about the exact nature of the active sites in these catalysts.
