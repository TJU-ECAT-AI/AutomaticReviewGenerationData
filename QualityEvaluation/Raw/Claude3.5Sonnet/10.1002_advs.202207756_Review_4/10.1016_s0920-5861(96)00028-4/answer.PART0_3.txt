[1] "C-H bond activation steps are fast during steady-state propane dehydrocyclodimerization on H-ZSM5, Ga/H-ZSM5, and Zn/H-ZSM5."

[2] "Ga and Zn species increase the rates of propane chemical conversion, recombinative hydrogen desorption, and deuterium incorporation from D2 into reaction products."

[3] "Disposal of hydrogen formed in C-H bond activation steps occurs by transfer of H-atoms to unsaturated species to form alkanes or to Ga and Zn species, which catalyze the recombinative desorption of H-atoms to form dihydrogen (H2)."

[4] "In-situ X-ray absorption studies suggest that Ga and Zn species reside at cation exchange sites as monomeric cations and that recombinative desorption involve reduction-oxidation cycles of such cations during each dehydrocyclodimerization turnover."

[5] "C3H8/C3D8 exchange data show that C-H bond activation rates on H-ZSM5 appear to be similar to those on Ga/H-ZSM5 and Zn/H-ZSM5"

[6] "C-H bond activation occurs predominantly on Brønsted acid sites."

The literature does not provide a comprehensive explanation of the alkyl mechanism in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions on gallium-based catalysts. However, based on the available information, we can infer some aspects of the mechanism:

The mechanism involves C-H bond activation as an initial step, which occurs predominantly on Brønsted acid sites rather than on gallium species. This C-H activation step is fast and quasi-equilibrated, not rate-determining.

After C-H activation, the key role of gallium species is in hydrogen disposal. Ga cations catalyze the recombinative desorption of H-atoms to form H2. This step involves redox cycles of the Ga cations.

The rate-determining step is likely the hydrogen disposal step rather than C-H activation, as the addition of Ga increases overall reaction rates without significantly affecting C-H activation rates.

The mechanism applies to monomeric Ga cations at cation exchange sites in the zeolite structure. 

The literature does not provide information to compare this to a carbenium mechanism or discuss different Ga species structures.

This mechanism differs from a purely acid-catalyzed route by introducing a more efficient pathway for hydrogen removal, which increases reaction rates and selectivity to desired products.

虽然文献没有提供镓基催化剂上丙烷脱氢(PDH)反应的烷基机理的全面解释,但根据可用信息,我们可以推断出该机理的一些方面:

该机理涉及C-H键活化作为初始步骤,这主要发生在Brønsted酸位点上,而不是在镓物种上。这个C-H活化步骤是快速和准平衡的,不是速率决定步骤。

C-H活化后,镓物种的关键作用是在氢处理中。Ga阳离子催化H原子的复合脱附形成H2。这一步骤涉及Ga阳离子的氧化还原循环。

速率决定步骤可能是氢处理步骤而不是C-H活化,因为添加Ga增加了总体反应速率,但没有显著影响C-H活化速率。

该机理适用于沸石结构中阳离子交换位点上的单体Ga阳离子。

文献没有提供信息来比较这与碳正离子机理或讨论不同的Ga物种结构。

这种机理与纯酸催化途径的不同之处在于引入了更有效的氢去除途径,从而提高了反应速率和目标产物的选择性。
