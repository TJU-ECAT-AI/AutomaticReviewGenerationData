          "Frash and van Santen [37] considered a similar gallium site to study the ethane dehydrogenation reaction pathway. The authors classified the reaction paths as of two types: (i) a carbenium activation pathway consisting an alkoxide-like intermediate along the reaction path after the activation of the CH (Rd+Hd) bond and (ii) an alkyl activation pathway supporting the formation of GaC coordination after the activation of the CH bond (Rd Hd+)."

          "After a detailed analysis the authors concluded that the alkyl activation path for [HGaH]+ species is the actual path for dehydrogenation. However, this conclusion was based on the observation that at higher temperatures, the initial CH activation step becomes the rate-determining step, and the calculated activation barrier (3940 kcal/mol) for this first step is in close agreement with the experimentally estimated value of 39 kcal/mol [20]."

          "We report a three-step mechanism for di-Al sites consisting of (1) CH activation, followed by (2) alkene desorption and (3) H2 removal."

          "We find that as AlAl distance increases, the activation barrier for CH activation decreases (ranging from 85.72 to 38.38 to 19.69 kcal/mol), while the barrier for H2 removal increases (ranging from 15.49 to 36.71 to 47.38 kcal/mol)resulting in an optimal AlAl separation distance of 4.53 A arising from these competing trends."

          "Also, experimentally it has been observed [11,28] that propene is far more reactive than propane, and hence it was concluded that initial dehydrogenation is likely to be the rate-limiting step."

          The alkyl mechanism for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) on gallium-based catalysts involves several key steps:

1. CH activation: The initial step where a CH bond in propane is broken, forming a GaC coordination.

2. Alkyl intermediate formation: An alkyl intermediate species is formed, bonded to the gallium site.

3. β-hydride elimination: A hydrogen from the β-carbon is transferred to the gallium, forming a CC double bond.

4. Alkene desorption: The formed propene desorbs from the catalyst surface.

5. H2 removal: Molecular hydrogen is removed, regenerating the active gallium site.

Comparing to the carbenium mechanism:
The carbenium mechanism involves an alkoxide-like intermediate after CH bond activation, while the alkyl mechanism forms a direct GaC bond. The carbenium pathway proceeds through a carbocation-like transition state, whereas the alkyl mechanism maintains a more covalent character.

The CH activation step is proposed as the rate-determining step (RDS) because:
1. It has the highest activation energy in the reaction sequence.
2. The calculated activation barrier (39-40 kcal/mol) closely matches experimental observations.
3. Experimental evidence shows propene is far more reactive than propane, suggesting initial dehydrogenation is the slowest step.

The alkyl mechanism applies differently to various Ga species structures:
1. For single-site [HGaH]+ species, the alkyl mechanism is possible but faces high activation barriers.
2. For di-Al sites (Z2[GaH]2+), the mechanism is more favorable. The AlAl distance significantly affects the energetics:
   - As AlAl distance increases, the CH activation barrier decreases (from 85.72 to 19.69 kcal/mol)
   - However, the H2 removal barrier increases with AlAl distance (from 15.49 to 47.38 kcal/mol)
   - An optimal AlAl distance of 4.53 Å balances these competing trends

This structure-activity relationship highlights the importance of the local environment around the Ga species in determining catalytic activity for PDH reactions.

          丙烷脱氢(PDH)在镓基催化剂上的烷基机理包括几个关键步骤：

1. CH活化：初始步骤，丙烷中的CH键断裂，形成GaC配位。

2. 烷基中间体形成：形成与镓位点结合的烷基中间体物种。

3. β-氢消除：β-碳上的氢转移到镓上，形成CC双键。

4. 烯烃脱附：形成的丙烯从催化剂表面脱附。

5. H2脱除：分子氢被移除，再生活性镓位点。

与碳正离子机理相比：
碳正离子机理在CH键活化后涉及类似烷氧化物的中间体，而烷基机理形成直接的GaC键。碳正离子途径通过类碳正离子过渡态进行，而烷基机理在整个过程中保持更多的共价特性。

CH活化步骤被提出为速率决定步骤(RDS)，原因如下：
1. 它在反应序列中具有最高的活化能。
2. 计算的活化能障（39-40 kcal/mol）与实验观察结果非常接近。
3. 实验证据表明丙烯比丙烷反应活性高得多，说明初始脱氢是最慢的步骤。

烷基机理对不同的Ga物种结构的应用不同：
1. 对于单位点[HGaH]+物种，烷基机理是可能的，但面临高活化能障。
2. 对于双Al位点（Z2[GaH]2+），该机理更有利。AlAl距离显著影响能量学：
   - 随着AlAl距离增加，CH活化能障降低（从85.72降至19.69 kcal/mol）
   - 然而，H2脱除能障随AlAl距离增加而增加（从15.49增至47.38 kcal/mol）
   - 最佳AlAl距离为4.53 Å，平衡了这些相互竞争的趋势

这种结构-活性关系突出了Ga物种周围局部环境在决定PDH反应催化活性中的重要性。
