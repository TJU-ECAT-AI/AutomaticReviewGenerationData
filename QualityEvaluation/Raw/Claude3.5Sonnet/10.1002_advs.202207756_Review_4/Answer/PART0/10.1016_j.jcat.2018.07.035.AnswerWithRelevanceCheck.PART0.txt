          [1] "Van Santen et al have confirmed by modeling calculation the mechanism that the alkane activation on Ga/HZSM-5 occurs by an alkyl mechanism and requires the concomitant participation of the zeolite oxygen (Lewis base) together with the gallium atom (Lewis Acid), and this active center is called bi-site (Scheme 1)"

[2] "Recently, Schreiber et al [36], proposed that the active sites for propane dehydrogenation in Ga/H-ZSM-5 with a Si/Al ratio of 50 is a Lewis-Brnsted acid pairs (scheme 2)."

[3] "We suggest that the dehydrogenation of the light alkanes requires strong LAS. On the hierarchical bifunctional catalysts which have only weak Lewis acid sites (Fig. SI.1), the dehydrogenation activity is low, while on bifunctional microporous catalysts LAS generated by the Ga species are slightly stronger, which coincides with a higher dehydrogenation activity (Fig. 9b)"

          The alkyl mechanism for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) on gallium-based catalysts involves several key steps:

1. Initial activation: Propane is activated at a bi-site consisting of a gallium atom (Lewis acid) and a neighboring zeolite oxygen (Lewis base).

2. C-H bond cleavage: The bi-site facilitates the breaking of a C-H bond in propane, forming a Ga-alkyl intermediate and a proton bound to the zeolite oxygen.

3. β-hydride elimination: A β-hydrogen from the alkyl group is transferred to the gallium, forming a Ga-H species and releasing propene.

4. Product desorption: Propene desorbs from the catalyst surface.

5. Catalyst regeneration: The Ga-H species reacts with the proton on the zeolite oxygen, releasing H2 and regenerating the active site.

Compared to the carbenium mechanism, which involves the formation of a carbocation intermediate, the alkyl mechanism proceeds through a more stable alkyl intermediate. The C-H activation step is proposed as the rate-determining step (RDS) because it involves breaking a strong C-H bond and requires the precise orientation of propane at the bi-site.

The alkyl mechanism applies to different Ga species structures, but the activity depends on the strength of the Lewis acid sites (LAS). Microporous Ga/HZSM-5 catalysts with stronger LAS show higher dehydrogenation activity compared to hierarchical catalysts with weaker LAS. This suggests that the strength of the Ga-O pair is crucial for efficient C-H activation.

Recent research has proposed that the active sites in Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts may be Lewis-Brønsted acid pairs rather than purely Lewis acid sites. This highlights the complexity of the active site structure and the potential synergy between different acid sites in the catalyst.

          镓基催化剂上丙烷脱氢(PDH)的烷基机理包括几个关键步骤：

1. 初始活化：丙烷在由镓原子（Lewis酸）和相邻的沸石氧（Lewis碱）组成的双位点上被活化。

2. C-H键断裂：丙烷的C-H键发生异裂，形成Ga-烷基中间体和与沸石氧结合的质子。

3. β-氢消除：烷基基团的β-氢转移到镓上，形成Ga-H物种并释放丙烯。

4. 产物脱附：丙烯从催化剂表面脱附。

5. 催化剂再生：Ga-H物种与沸石氧上的质子反应，释放H2并再生活性位点。

与涉及碳正离子中间体形成的碳正离子机理相比，烷基机理通过更稳定的烷基中间体进行。C-H活化步骤被提出为速率决定步骤(RDS)，因为它涉及断裂强C-H键，并需要丙烷在双位点上精确定向。

烷基机理适用于不同的Ga物种结构，但活性取决于Lewis酸位点(LAS)的强度。具有较强LAS的微孔Ga/HZSM-5催化剂比具有较弱LAS的多级催化剂表现出更高的脱氢活性。这表明Ga-O对的强度对高效C-H活化至关重要。

最近的研究提出，Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂中的活性位点可能是Lewis-Brønsted酸对，而不是纯Lewis酸位点。这突出了活性位点结构的复杂性以及催化剂中不同酸位点之间的潜在协同作用。
