The alkyl mechanism in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions on gallium-based catalysts involves several key steps:

1. Initial activation: Propane is activated by the gallium metal cation.
2. Intermediate formation: An alkyl gallium intermediate (Ga-C3H7) is formed.
3. β-elimination: This process occurs following the intermediate formation.
4. Product formation: Propylene and H2 desorb from the catalyst surface.

The CH activation step and the formation of the alkyl metal intermediate are proposed as the rate-determining step (RDS) in this mechanism. This is likely due to the energy required to break the strong C-H bond in propane.

Comparing the alkyl mechanism to the carbenium mechanism:
- The main difference lies in the role of Ga species in PDH:
  - Alkyl mechanism: Ga activates the CH bond in propane
  - Carbenium mechanism: Ga facilitates the recombination of H adatoms to release H2
- The alkyl mechanism involves the formation of a Ga-C3H7 intermediate, while the carbenium mechanism forms a C3H7+ species.
- These intermediates can be distinguished experimentally through their different CH stretching bands in IR spectroscopy.

The alkyl mechanism can apply to different Ga species structures, including Ga+, [GaH]+, [GaH2]+, and Ga2O22+. However, the specific pathway and energetics may vary depending on the Ga species involved:
- For [GaH2]+, the stepwise alkyl pathway is more favorable, with C-H activation being the RDS.
- For [GaH]2+, ethene formation is the RDS in the alkyl pathway, but the carbenium pathway is slightly more favorable.

It's important to note that both the carbenium and alkyl mechanisms might be occurring simultaneously on different types of Ga sites within the catalyst. The dominance of either mechanism may depend on factors such as Ga loading and Al distribution in the H-ZSM-5 support, which affect the distribution of different Ga species.

The alkyl mechanism in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions on gallium-based catalysts involves several key steps:

1. Initial propane activation: The process begins with heterolytic C-H bond cleavage. Gallium species act as Lewis acids, promoting this cleavage in conjunction with basic oxygen atoms from the zeolite lattice.

2. Oxidative addition: An alkane molecule undergoes oxidative addition to the Ga+ cation through an indirect heterolytic mechanism involving the basic oxygen atoms of the zeolite lattice.

3. Formation of intermediate: The activation results in the formation of a gallium-alkyl hydride intermediate, such as [HGaC3H7]+ in the case of propane.

4. Dehydrogenation and product formation: The intermediate species undergoes decomposition, leading to the simultaneous desorption of H2 and the alkene (propene in PDH).

5. Catalyst regeneration: The initial Ga+ species is regenerated, closing the catalytic cycle.

Comparing this to the carbenium mechanism:
The alkyl mechanism is generally more favorable for hydrocarbon dehydrogenation over gallium-based catalysts. In the alkyl mechanism, a neutral or positively charged alkyl group is bound to the gallium center, while the carbenium mechanism involves the formation of a distinct carbocation intermediate.

The C-H activation step is often proposed as the rate-determining step (RDS) because it typically has the highest energy barrier in the overall reaction pathway. The apparent activation barrier for this process is estimated to be around 233 kJ/mol.

The alkyl mechanism applies to different Ga species structures, including Ga+, GaH2+, and GaH2+. All these gallium species act as Lewis acids promoting heterolytic CH cleavage. However, the reactivity and stability of these species can vary depending on their local environment within the zeolite framework. Ga+ ions are generally considered the most active and stable species for PDH reactions, while GaH2+ species may decompose to Ga+ during the catalytic cycle.

The alkyl mechanism for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) on gallium-based catalysts involves several key steps:

1. Initial activation: At high temperatures (around 523 K), propane undergoes weak, dissociative adsorption on Ga+ active sites.

2. C-H bond activation: Propane dissociation occurs via oxidative addition to Ga+ ions, forming propyl and hydride fragments coordinated to Ga3+ species.

3. β-hydride elimination: The propyl fragment undergoes β-hydride elimination, resulting in the formation of propene and gallium hydride species.

4. Product desorption: Propene desorbs from the catalyst surface.

5. Catalyst regeneration: The gallium hydride species recombine and desorb as molecular hydrogen, regenerating the active Ga+ site.

Compared to the carbenium mechanism, the alkyl mechanism does not involve the formation of carbocations or Brønsted acid sites. Instead, it proceeds through organometallic-like intermediates.

The C-H activation step is proposed as the rate-determining step (RDS) because it involves breaking a strong C-H bond, which typically requires significant energy input and determines the overall reaction rate.

The alkyl mechanism applies to different Ga species structures, including isolated Ga+ ions and small Ga clusters. The key aspect is the ability of Ga species to undergo oxidative addition and facilitate C-H bond activation without generating strong acid sites.

This mechanism explains the observed stability of Ga-based catalysts, the absence of significant coke formation, and the high selectivity towards olefins. The lack of Brønsted acidity in reduced Ga/ZSM-5 prevents further conversion of olefins to oligomers or aromatics, contributing to the high selectivity.

The alkyl mechanism for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) on gallium-based catalysts involves several key steps:

1. Initial activation: Propane is activated at a bi-site consisting of a gallium atom (Lewis acid) and a neighboring zeolite oxygen (Lewis base).

2. C-H bond cleavage: The bi-site facilitates the breaking of a C-H bond in propane, forming a Ga-alkyl intermediate and a proton bound to the zeolite oxygen.

3. β-hydride elimination: A β-hydrogen from the alkyl group is transferred to the gallium, forming a Ga-H species and releasing propene.

4. Product desorption: Propene desorbs from the catalyst surface.

5. Catalyst regeneration: The Ga-H species reacts with the proton on the zeolite oxygen, releasing H2 and regenerating the active site.

Compared to the carbenium mechanism, which involves the formation of a carbocation intermediate, the alkyl mechanism proceeds through a more stable alkyl intermediate. The C-H activation step is proposed as the rate-determining step (RDS) because it involves breaking a strong C-H bond and requires the precise orientation of propane at the bi-site.

The alkyl mechanism applies to different Ga species structures, but the activity depends on the strength of the Lewis acid sites (LAS). Microporous Ga/HZSM-5 catalysts with stronger LAS show higher dehydrogenation activity compared to hierarchical catalysts with weaker LAS. This suggests that the strength of the Ga-O pair is crucial for efficient C-H activation.

Recent research has proposed that the active sites in Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts may be Lewis-Brønsted acid pairs rather than purely Lewis acid sites. This highlights the complexity of the active site structure and the potential synergy between different acid sites in the catalyst.

The alkyl mechanism for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) on gallium-based catalysts involves several key steps:

1. Initial propane activation: Propane interacts with a gallium active site (Ga+) to form an alkyl-hydride intermediate (ZGa+H(C3H7)).

2. Dehydrogenation: The alkyl-hydride intermediate undergoes β-hydride elimination to produce propylene (C3H6) and hydrogen (H2), regenerating the Ga+ site.

3. Alkyl rearrangement: Alternatively, the alkyl-hydride intermediate can rearrange to form a more stable alkylgallium species (ZGa+(CH3)(C2H5)).

This mechanism differs from the carbenium mechanism in that it involves direct C-H bond activation by the gallium species without carbocation formation. The C-H activation step is often considered the rate-determining step (RDS) because it involves breaking a strong C-H bond and is typically the highest energy barrier in the overall reaction pathway.

The alkyl mechanism applies to different Ga species structures:

1. For isolated Ga+ sites, the mechanism proceeds as described above.
2. For GaH2+ species, an initial step involves the reaction with propane to form the alkyl-hydride intermediate, releasing H2.
3. However, research shows that dihydridogallium ions (GaH2+) are not stable under propane flow and are rapidly replaced by alkylgallium species. This suggests that GaH2+ is not the active site for alkane activation, contrary to some previous proposals.

The alkyl mechanism explains the observed formation of stable alkylgallium species under reaction conditions, the absence of dihydridogallium species during propane dehydrogenation, and the competition between hydrogen and propane for active sites. It provides a more accurate description of the PDH process on gallium-based catalysts than previous proposals involving dihydridogallium ions as active sites.

The provided literature does not specifically discuss the alkyl mechanism in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions on gallium-based catalysts. However, it does describe a similar mechanism for n-pentane dehydrogenation on GaH2+ embedded zeolite catalysts, which can be used to infer information about the PDH reaction.

The mechanism described involves three key steps:

1. C-H bond activation: The alkane (n-pentane in this case) is activated by breaking a C-H bond, forming a Brønsted acid proton on the zeolite framework.

2. Hydrogen desorption: A hydrogen molecule is formed and desorbed through the recombination of the Brønsted acid proton and a hydride ion from the gallium species.

3. Alkene formation: The Ga-alkyl intermediate decomposes to form the alkene product and regenerate the gallium active site.

For n-pentane dehydrogenation, the rate-determining step is identified as the decomposition of the Ga-C5H11 species to form 1-pentene, with an activation energy of 63.8 kcal/mol. This step is likely analogous to the formation of propene in the PDH reaction.

While the document doesn't explicitly compare this mechanism to the carbenium mechanism or discuss why the C-H activation step is proposed as the rate-determining step in PDH reactions, it does provide insights into how the mechanism applies to different Ga species structures. The study suggests that highly dispersed Ga species on zeolite nanosheets are more favorable for alkane activation compared to bulk Ga2O3 fragments in conventional zeolites.

To fully answer the question about the PDH reaction specifically, additional information beyond what is provided in this document would be needed.

The provided literature does not offer a comprehensive explanation of the alkyl mechanism in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions on gallium-based catalysts. However, it does provide some insights into the dehydrogenation process on gallium-exchanged zeolites:

          1. The rate-limiting step in ethane dehydrogenation (which may be analogous to propane dehydrogenation) involves the formation of ethene from an ethyl species chemisorbed to a GaH-zeolite site.

          2. Various gallium species structures can form under dehydrogenation conditions, including Ga(III)Hx, Ga(II)Ga(II)Hx, and Ga(III)Ga(I)Hx.

          3. Gallium-exchanged zeolites show higher dehydrogenation activities compared to sodium or proton-exchanged zeolites, which is attributed to avoiding the high barriers associated with carbonium ion formation.

          4. The exact reaction mechanisms and nature of gallium active sites are not fully understood.

          5. The zeolite framework can have a significant stabilizing effect on transition state structures, which may impact the energetics of the reaction steps.

          The literature does not explicitly compare the alkyl mechanism to the carbenium mechanism or explain why C-H activation is proposed as the rate-determining step. It also does not provide detailed information on how the alkyl mechanism applies to different Ga species structures. More specific research on propane dehydrogenation mechanisms would be needed to fully answer the question.

The literature does not provide a comprehensive explanation of the alkyl mechanism for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) on gallium-based catalysts. However, based on the available information, we can infer some aspects of the mechanism:

1. Initial Propane Activation: The mechanism involves C-H bond activation as an initial step, which occurs predominantly on Brønsted acid sites rather than on gallium species. This C-H activation step is fast and quasi-equilibrated, not rate-determining.

2. Role of Gallium: After C-H activation, the key role of gallium species is in hydrogen disposal. Ga cations catalyze the recombinative desorption of H-atoms to form H2. This step involves redox cycles of the Ga cations.

3. Rate-Determining Step: The rate-determining step is likely the hydrogen disposal step rather than C-H activation, as the addition of Ga increases overall reaction rates without significantly affecting C-H activation rates.

4. Gallium Species Structure: The mechanism applies to monomeric Ga cations at cation exchange sites in the zeolite structure. 

5. Comparison to Carbenium Mechanism: The literature does not provide information to compare this to a carbenium mechanism.

6. Different Ga Species Structures: The document doesn't discuss how the mechanism applies to different Ga species structures.

This mechanism differs from a purely acid-catalyzed route by introducing a more efficient pathway for hydrogen removal, which increases reaction rates and selectivity to desired products.

The alkyl mechanism for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) on gallium-based catalysts involves several key steps:

1. Initial activation: Propane adsorbs on the undercoordinated Ga species, likely in a side-on fashion.

2. C-H bond activation: The GaH species performs an electrophilic attack on the propane, causing an SN2-like inversion of the methyl group. This forms a Ga-C bond and generates a Brønsted acid site. The C-H bond is polarized such that the carbon develops a negative (δ-) charge and the hydrogen a positive (δ+) charge.

3. Formation of Ga-alkyl intermediate: This step results in the formation of a Ga-alkyl species, specifically [HGaC3H7]+ in the case of propane.

4. β-hydride elimination: The Ga-propyl species undergoes β-hydride elimination to form propene and a Ga-H species.

5. Product desorption: Propene desorbs from the Ga-alkyl intermediate, leaving behind a gallium dihydride species [GaH2]+.

6. Catalyst regeneration: The final step involves the removal of H2 to regenerate the active GaH site.

Compared to the carbenium mechanism, the alkyl mechanism generally has lower activation barriers for the initial C-H bond activation step. However, the subsequent alkene desorption step in the alkyl mechanism faces a very high activation barrier (around 60 kcal/mol for ethene), which is not present in the carbenium pathway.

The C-H activation step is often proposed as the rate-determining step (RDS) in PDH reactions because it involves breaking a strong C-H bond and typically has a significant activation barrier. However, for the alkyl mechanism specifically, the alkene desorption step may actually be rate-limiting due to its unexpectedly high barrier.

The researchers observed a linear Brønsted-Evans-Polanyi relation for alkyl activation, carbenium activation, and hydrogen removal steps. This relationship suggests that the activation energy for these steps correlates with the thermodynamic properties of the reaction, which can vary depending on the specific Ga species structure.

The alkyl mechanism can apply to different Ga species structures, including monofunctional Ga+ sites and bifunctional [GaH]2+ sites associated with framework Al pairs in zeolites. The specific energetics and relative favorability of the alkyl vs. carbenium mechanisms may vary depending on the exact nature and environment of the Ga active sites.

The alkyl mechanism for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) on gallium-based catalysts involves several key steps:

1. CH activation: The initial step where a CH bond in propane is broken, forming a GaC coordination.

2. Alkyl intermediate formation: An alkyl intermediate species is formed, bonded to the gallium site.

3. β-hydride elimination: A hydrogen from the β-carbon is transferred to the gallium, forming a CC double bond.

4. Alkene desorption: The formed propene desorbs from the catalyst surface.

5. H2 removal: Molecular hydrogen is removed, regenerating the active gallium site.

Comparing to the carbenium mechanism:
The carbenium mechanism involves an alkoxide-like intermediate after CH bond activation, while the alkyl mechanism forms a direct GaC bond. The carbenium pathway proceeds through a carbocation-like transition state, whereas the alkyl mechanism maintains a more covalent character.

The CH activation step is proposed as the rate-determining step (RDS) because:
1. It has the highest activation energy in the reaction sequence.
2. The calculated activation barrier (39-40 kcal/mol) closely matches experimental observations.
3. Experimental evidence shows propene is far more reactive than propane, suggesting initial dehydrogenation is the slowest step.

The alkyl mechanism applies differently to various Ga species structures:
1. For single-site [HGaH]+ species, the alkyl mechanism is possible but faces high activation barriers.
2. For di-Al sites (Z2[GaH]2+), the mechanism is more favorable. The AlAl distance significantly affects the energetics:
   - As AlAl distance increases, the CH activation barrier decreases (from 85.72 to 19.69 kcal/mol)
   - However, the H2 removal barrier increases with AlAl distance (from 15.49 to 47.38 kcal/mol)
   - An optimal AlAl distance of 4.53 Å balances these competing trends

This structure-activity relationship highlights the importance of the local environment around the Ga species in determining catalytic activity for PDH reactions.

The alkyl mechanism in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions on gallium-based catalysts involves several key steps:

1. Initial activation: Propane is activated by the gallium metal cation.
2. Intermediate formation: An alkyl gallium intermediate (Ga-C3H7) is formed.
3. β-elimination: This process occurs following the intermediate formation.
4. Product formation: Propylene and H2 desorb from the catalyst surface.

1. It has the highest activation energy in the reaction sequence.
2. The calculated activation barrier (39-40 kcal/mol) closely matches experimental observations.
3. Experimental evidence shows propene is far more reactive than propane, suggesting initial dehydrogenation is the slowest step.

The alkyl mechanism applies differently to various Ga species structures:
1. For single-site [HGaH]+ species, the alkyl mechanism is possible but faces high activation barriers.
2. For di-Al sites (Z2[GaH]2+), the mechanism is more favorable. The AlAl distance significantly affects the energetics:
   - As AlAl distance increases, the CH activation barrier decreases (from 85.72 to 19.69 kcal/mol)
   - However, the H2 removal barrier increases with AlAl distance (from 15.49 to 47.38 kcal/mol)
   - An optimal AlAl distance of 4.53 Å balances these competing trends

This structure-activity relationship highlights the importance of the local environment around the Ga species in determining catalytic activity for PDH reactions.
