[1] "Similar to the carbenium mechanism, the alkyl mechanism could be at play regardless of the specific structure of active Ga species, on which propane is initially activated by the metal cation to form the alkyl gallium intermediate, followed by the β-elimination and the desorption of propylene and H2."

[2] "The CH activation step and the formation of an alkyl metal intermediate were proposed as the RDS, as shown in Scheme 2."

[3] "The key difference between the two mechanisms is the role of Ga species in PDH: facilitate the recombination of H adatoms to release H2 versus activate the CH bond in propane."

[4] "Another potentially experimentally verifiable difference between mechanisms is the formation of an alkyl metal intermediate, Ga-C3H7, whose CH stretching bands in IR spectroscopy are expected to be different from those in C3H7+."

[5] "For [GaH2]+, the stepwise alkyl pathway is more favorable, with C-H activation being the RDS. For the [GaH]2+, ethene formation is the RDS when the reaction proceeds via the alkyl pathway, however, the carbenium pathway is slightly more favorable with a similar ethene formation and CH activation energy."

[6] "The possibility that both Ga-C3H7 and C3H7+ are present and in turn, both the carbenium and the alkyl mechanisms are at play, cannot be ruled out. Thus, PDH could occur via different mechanisms on different types of Ga sites."

[7] "Since the distribution of different Ga species is impacted by both Ga loading and Al distribution in H-ZSM-5, it is possible that the carbenium or alkyl mechanism is dominant on Ga/H-ZSM-5 with different densities of Ga species."

"In general, alkanes are preferentially activated via an alkyl mechanism, in which gallium acts as an acceptor of the alkyl group."

"The initial step of CH activation is the oxidative addition of an alkane molecule to the Ga+ cation, which proceeds via an indirect heterolytic mechanism involving the basic oxygen atoms of the zeolite lattice."

"The catalytic cycle is closed by one-step decomposition of [HGaC2H5]+Z. It was found that simultaneous desorption of H2 and C2H4 from these species [reaction (5)] is the most favorable process."

"Recently, it was shown experimentally [42,45] and theoretically [41] that the alkyl pathway of hydrocarbon dehydrogenation over zinc-exchanged zeolites is much more favorable than the carbenium pathway."

"The apparent activation barrier for this process estimated within the model used is equal to 233 kJ/mol."

"It was found that at the initial step of ethane activation, all of the gallium species considered act as Lewis acids promoting heterolytic CH cleavage involving the basic oxygen atoms of the zeolite lattice."

"On the contrary, Ga1 adsorbs ethane much more weakly and dissociative ethane adsorption was only found upon heating to 523 K. In this case ethane dissociation proceeds via oxidative addition to Ga1 ions, giving ethyl and hydride fragments coordinating to Ga31 species."

"ZO  Ga1  C2H6 - ZO  [Ga31(H)(C2H5)]1"

"Further heating in vacuum leads to the dissociation of the ethyl fragment into ethylene and gallium hydride species."

"ZO[Ga31(H)(C2H5)]1 - ZO[Ga31(H)2]1  C2H4"

"Ga/ZSM-5 shows a stable activity as a function of the reaction time. Moreover, the catalyst remains white after reaction, indicative of the absence of large amounts of coke formation."

"The only product observed during ethane conversion over Ga/ZSM-5 is ethylene. The further conversion of ethylene to oligomers or aromatics is impeded by the absence of Brnsted acidity in reduced Ga/ZSM-5"

[1] "Van Santen et al have confirmed by modeling calculation the mechanism that the alkane activation on Ga/HZSM-5 occurs by an alkyl mechanism and requires the concomitant participation of the zeolite oxygen (Lewis base) together with the gallium atom (Lewis Acid), and this active center is called bi-site (Scheme 1)"

[2] "Recently, Schreiber et al [36], proposed that the active sites for propane dehydrogenation in Ga/H-ZSM-5 with a Si/Al ratio of 50 is a Lewis-Brnsted acid pairs (scheme 2)."

[3] "We suggest that the dehydrogenation of the light alkanes requires strong LAS. On the hierarchical bifunctional catalysts which have only weak Lewis acid sites (Fig. SI.1), the dehydrogenation activity is low, while on bifunctional microporous catalysts LAS generated by the Ga species are slightly stronger, which coincides with a higher dehydrogenation activity (Fig. 9b)"

          [5] "Dihydridogallium ions were observed after reduction in hydrogen, but were slowly decomposed when hydrogen flow was replaced by inert gas. This slow decomposition of the dihydridogallium ions shows that it cannot intermediate hydrogen desorption during the aromatization reaction."
          [6] "However, when hydrogen is replaced by propane, the dihydrido species appear to be rapidly replaced by alkylgallium ions. Under propane flow, dihydridogallium cations were never detected. These facts show that it cannot be the active site for alkane activation, as proposed by some investigators."

[1] "To gain insights into the roles of various Ga active species on the catalytic performance, the mechanism of n-pentane dehydrogenation, which was considered as the rate determining step of alkane aromatization [46], was investigated by means of quantum chemical calculations."

[2] "The mechanism for the GaH2+ embedded zeolite (Fig. 8B) has been proposed by the following three-step mechanism: (i) the activation of the CeH bond of n-pentane to form a Brnsted acid proton at zeolite framework (I II III); (ii) the desorption of hydrogen molecule (H1-H2Z) via a recombination of the acidic proton and one of the hydride ions attached to gallium atom (III IV V); (iii) the decomposition of Ga-C5H11 species to form alkene and gallium active sites (V VI VII VIII) that could be regenerated in the presence of H2 or alkane feed [9a,49,54] as shown in Fig. 8B."

[3] "It was found that the rate determining step was the decomposition of Ga-C5H11 species to form 1-pentene with the activation energy of 63.8 kcal mol1 (Fig. 8C, black)."

[4] "Ga species can promote the dehydrogenation of paraffins [41], while Brønsted acid sites facilitate oligomerization and aromatization [42,43]."

[1] "The limiting step in dehydrogenation of ethane catalyzed by a gallium-exchanged zeolite cluster model corresponds to a transition state structure that leads to the formation of ethene from ethyl chemisorbed to GaH-Z, where Z is the zeolite cluster (see TS3 in Scheme 2)."

          [2] "It is found that a number of structures in which gallium is present as Ga(III)Hx, Ga(II)Ga(II)Hx, and Ga(III)Ga(I)Hx can be reached under alkane dehydrogenation conditions."

          [3] "Although sodium or proton-exchanged zeolites also shows some catalytic activity in dehydrogenation reactions [6], the activity is rather low due to the high barriers associated with the generation of carbonium ions. Gallium-exchanged zeolites allow higher dehydrogenation activities [5,7]."

          [4] "The details of the reaction mechanisms and the nature of the gallium active sites in these reactions are not precisely known [11,12]."

          [5] "It is now well understood that the zeolite framework can have a significant stabilizing effect of transition state structures [15,16]."

[1] "C-H activation steps are fast during steady-state propane dehydrocyclodimerization on H-ZSM5, Ga/H-ZSM5, and Zn/H-ZSM5."

[2] "Ga and Zn species increase the rates of propane chemical conversion, recombinative hydrogen desorption, and deuterium incorporation from D2 into reaction products."

[3] "Disposal of hydrogen formed in C-H bond activation steps occurs by transfer of H-atoms to unsaturated species to form alkanes or to Ga and Zn species, which catalyze the recombinative desorption of H-atoms to form dihydrogen (H2)."

[4] "In-situ X-ray absorption studies suggest that Ga and Zn species reside at cation exchange sites as monomeric cations and that recombinative desorption involve reduction-oxidation cycles of such cations during each dehydrocyclodimerization turnover."

[5] "C3H8/C3D8 exchange data show that C-H bond activation rates on H-ZSM5 appear to be similar to those on Ga/H-ZSM5 and Zn/H-ZSM5"

[6] "C-H bond activation occurs predominantly on Brønsted acid sites."

"Scheme 3 shows a generalized catalytic cycle for dehydrogenation starting with alkyl activation, including all possible intermediates along any alkyl activation path."

"The intermediate D further undergoes alkyl activation as shown in Scheme 3 (D [E] F). The mechanistic step is seen as the SN2 inversion of the methyl group caused by the electrophilic attack of the undercoordinated GaH species."

"Alkyl activation is followed by desorption of an alkene (ethene) from the Gaalkyl intermediate (F [I] J K + C2H4), leaving behind the gallium dihydride species ([GaH2]+Z
m)."

"Although alkyl activation is much more facile than the carbenium activation, ethene removal from [HGaC2H5]+Z
m intermediate faces a very high activation barrier of 60 kcal/mol."

"We find a linear BrnstedEvansPolanyi relation for such mechanistic steps as carbenium activation, alkyl activation, and hydrogen removal."

"Alkyl activation involves CH polarization in such a way that the carbon develops a negative (δ) charge and the hydrogen develops a positive (δ+) charge. Alkyl activation leads to the formation of a metal-alkyl (MCnH2n+1) and the Brnsted acid as intermediates."

"Frash and van Santen [37] considered a similar gallium site to study the ethane dehydrogenation reaction pathway. The authors classified the reaction paths as of two types: (i) a carbenium activation pathway consisting an alkoxide-like intermediate along the reaction path after the activation of the CH (Rd+Hd) bond and (ii) an alkyl activation pathway supporting the formation of GaC coordination after the activation of the CH bond (Rd Hd+)."

          "After a detailed analysis the authors concluded that the alkyl activation path for [HGaH]+ species is the actual path for dehydrogenation. However, this conclusion was based on the observation that at higher temperatures, the initial CH activation step becomes the rate-determining step, and the calculated activation barrier (3940 kcal/mol) for this first step is in close agreement with the experimentally estimated value of 39 kcal/mol [20]."

          "We report a three-step mechanism for di-Al sites consisting of (1) CH activation, followed by (2) alkene desorption and (3) H2 removal."

          "We find that as AlAl distance increases, the activation barrier for CH activation decreases (ranging from 85.72 to 38.38 to 19.69 kcal/mol), while the barrier for H2 removal increases (ranging from 15.49 to 36.71 to 47.38 kcal/mol)resulting in an optimal AlAl separation distance of 4.53 A arising from these competing trends."

          "Also, experimentally it has been observed [11,28] that propene is far more reactive than propane, and hence it was concluded that initial dehydrogenation is likely to be the rate-limiting step."

[1] "Similar to the carbenium mechanism, the alkyl mechanism could be at play regardless of the specific structure of active Ga species, on which propane is initially activated by the metal cation to form the alkyl gallium intermediate, followed by the β-elimination and the desorption of propylene and H2."
