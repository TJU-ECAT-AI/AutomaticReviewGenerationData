Experimental evidence shows propene is far more reactive than propane, suggesting initial dehydrogenation is the slowest step.\n\nThe alkyl mechanism applies differently to various Ga species structures:\n1. For single-site [HGaH]+ species, the alkyl mechanism is possible but faces high activation barriers.\n2. For di-Al sites (Z2[GaH]2+), the mechanism is more favorable. The AlAl distance significantly affects the energetics:\n   - As AlAl distance increases, the CH activation barrier decreases (from 85.72 to 19.69 kcal/mol)\n   - However, the H2 removal barrier increases with AlAl distance (from 15.49 to 47.38 kcal/mol)\n   - An optimal AlAl distance of 4.53 Å balances these competing trends\n\nThis structure-activity relationship highlights the importance of the local environment around the Ga species in determining catalytic activity for PDH reactions.", "Chinese": "丙烷脱氢(PDH)在镓基催化剂上的烷基机理包括几个关键步骤：\n\n1. CH活化：初始步骤，丙烷中的CH键断裂，形成GaC配位。\n\n2. 烷基中间体形成：形成与镓位点结合的烷基中间体物种。\n\n3. β-氢消除：β-碳上的氢转移到镓上，形成CC双键。\n\n4. 烯烃脱附：形成的丙烯从催化剂表面脱附。\n\n5. H2脱除：分子氢被移除，再生活性镓位点。\n\n与碳正离子机理相比：\n碳正离子机理在CH键活化后涉及类似烷氧化物的中间体，而烷基机理形成直接的GaC键。碳正离子途径通过类碳正离子过渡态进行，而烷基机理在整个过程中保持更多的共价特性。\n\nCH活化步骤被提出为速率决定步骤(RDS)，原因如下：\n1. 它在反应序列中具有最高的活化能。\n2. 计算的活化能障（39-40 kcal/mol）与实验观察结果非常接近。\n3. 实验证据表明丙烯比丙烷反应活性高得多，说明初始脱氢是最慢的步骤。\n\n烷基机理对不同的Ga物种结构的应用不同：\n1. 对于单位点[HGaH]+物种，烷基机理是可能的，但面临高活化能障。\n2. 对于双Al位点（Z2[GaH]2+），该机理更有利。AlAl距离显著影响能量学：\n   - 随着AlAl距离增加，CH活化能障降低（从85.72降至19.69 kcal/mol）\n   - 然而，H2脱除能障随AlAl距离增加而增加（从15.49增至47.38 kcal/mol）\n   - 最佳AlAl距离为4.53 Å，平衡了这些相互竞争的趋势\n\n这种结构-活性关系突出了Ga物种周围局部环境在决定PDH反应催化活性中的重要性。", "Doi": "10.1016/j.cattod.2005.04.017"},
