          [1] "Similar to the carbenium mechanism, the alkyl mechanism could be at play regardless of the specific structure of active Ga species, on which propane is initially activated by the metal cation to form the alkyl gallium intermediate, followed by the β-elimination and the desorption of propylene and H2."

[2] "The CH activation step and the formation of an alkyl metal intermediate were proposed as the RDS, as shown in Scheme 2."

[3] "The key difference between the two mechanisms is the role of Ga species in PDH: facilitate the recombination of H adatoms to release H2 versus activate the CH bond in propane."

[4] "Another potentially experimentally verifiable difference between mechanisms is the formation of an alkyl metal intermediate, Ga-C3H7, whose CH stretching bands in IR spectroscopy are expected to be different from those in C3H7+."

[5] "For [GaH2]+, the stepwise alkyl pathway is more favorable, with C-H activation being the RDS. For the [GaH]2+, ethene formation is the RDS when the reaction proceeds via the alkyl pathway, however, the carbenium pathway is slightly more favorable with a similar ethene formation and CH activation energy."

[6] "The possibility that both Ga-C3H7 and C3H7+ are present and in turn, both the carbenium and the alkyl mechanisms are at play, cannot be ruled out. Thus, PDH could occur via different mechanisms on different types of Ga sites."

[7] "Since the distribution of different Ga species is impacted by both Ga loading and Al distribution in H-ZSM-5, it is possible that the carbenium or alkyl mechanism is dominant on Ga/H-ZSM-5 with different densities of Ga species."

          The alkyl mechanism in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions on gallium-based catalysts involves several key steps:

1. Initial activation: Propane is activated by the gallium metal cation.
2. Intermediate formation: An alkyl gallium intermediate (Ga-C3H7) is formed.
3. β-elimination: This process occurs following the intermediate formation.
4. Product formation: Propylene and H2 desorb from the catalyst surface.

The CH activation step and the formation of the alkyl metal intermediate are proposed as the rate-determining step (RDS) in this mechanism. This is likely due to the energy required to break the strong C-H bond in propane.

Comparing the alkyl mechanism to the carbenium mechanism:
- The main difference lies in the role of Ga species in PDH:
  - Alkyl mechanism: Ga activates the CH bond in propane
  - Carbenium mechanism: Ga facilitates the recombination of H adatoms to release H2
- The alkyl mechanism involves the formation of a Ga-C3H7 intermediate, while the carbenium mechanism forms a C3H7+ species.
- These intermediates can be distinguished experimentally through their different CH stretching bands in IR spectroscopy.

The alkyl mechanism can apply to different Ga species structures, including Ga+, [GaH]+, [GaH2]+, and Ga2O22+. However, the specific pathway and energetics may vary depending on the Ga species involved:
- For [GaH2]+, the stepwise alkyl pathway is more favorable, with C-H activation being the RDS.
- For [GaH]2+, ethene formation is the RDS in the alkyl pathway, but the carbenium pathway is slightly more favorable.

It's important to note that both the carbenium and alkyl mechanisms might be occurring simultaneously on different types of Ga sites within the catalyst. The dominance of either mechanism may depend on factors such as Ga loading and Al distribution in the H-ZSM-5 support, which affect the distribution of different Ga species.

          在基于镓的催化剂上进行的丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中，烷基机理涉及几个关键步骤：

1. 初始活化：丙烷被镓金属阳离子活化。
2. 中间体形成：形成烷基镓中间体（Ga-C3H7）。
3. β-消除：这个过程在中间体形成后发生。
4. 产物形成：丙烯和H2从催化剂表面脱附。

C-H活化步骤和烷基金属中间体的形成被提出作为该机理的速率决定步骤（RDS）。这很可能是由于断裂丙烷中强C-H键所需的能量。

将烷基机理与碳正离子机理进行比较：
- 主要区别在于镓物种在PDH中的作用：
  - 烷基机理：镓活化丙烷中的CH键
  - 碳正离子机理：镓促进H原子的重组以释放H2
- 烷基机理涉及Ga-C3H7中间体的形成，而碳正离子机理形成C3H7+物种。
- 这些中间体可以通过IR光谱中不同的CH伸缩带进行实验区分。

烷基机理可以适用于不同的镓物种结构，包括Ga+、[GaH]+、[GaH2]+和Ga2O22+。然而，具体的反应路径和能量学可能会因涉及的镓物种而异：
- 对于[GaH2]+，逐步烷基途径更有利，C-H活化是RDS。
- 对于[GaH]2+，在烷基途径中乙烯形成是RDS，但碳正离子途径略有优势。

需要注意的是，碳正离子机理和烷基机理可能同时在催化剂中不同类型的镓位点上发生。任一机理的主导地位可能取决于诸如镓负载量和H-ZSM-5支持体中Al分布等因素，这些因素影响不同镓物种的分布。
