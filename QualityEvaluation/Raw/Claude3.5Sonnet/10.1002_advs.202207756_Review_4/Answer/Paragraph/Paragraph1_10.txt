The alkyl mechanism in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions on gallium-based catalysts is a crucial process in the production of propylene, an important chemical feedstock. This mechanism involves several key steps, beginning with the adsorption of propane on the catalyst surface, followed by C-H bond activation to form an alkyl intermediate. The subsequent Î²-hydride elimination step leads to the formation of propylene, which then desorbs from the catalyst. The rate-determining step in this mechanism is typically the initial C-H bond activation, which requires overcoming a significant energy barrier. In contrast to the carbenium mechanism, which involves the formation of a carbocation intermediate, the alkyl mechanism maintains a neutral charge throughout the reaction. This difference results in distinct kinetics and selectivity patterns between the two mechanisms. The alkyl mechanism generally exhibits higher selectivity towards propylene and lower coke formation compared to the carbenium pathway, making it particularly advantageous for industrial applications using gallium-based catalysts in PDH reactions.
