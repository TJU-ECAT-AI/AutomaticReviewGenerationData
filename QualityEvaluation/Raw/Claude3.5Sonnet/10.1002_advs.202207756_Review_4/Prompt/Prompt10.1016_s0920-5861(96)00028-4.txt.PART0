Abstract 
The rate of propane dehydrocyclodimerization to form C 6 -- aromatics is limited by a sequence of irreversible 
dehydrogenation reactions leading to propene, higher alkenes, dienes, tfienes, and aromatics. Quasi-equilibrated acid-cata- 
lyzed cracking, oligomerization, and cyclization 
reactions of alkene intermediates occur in sequence with these dehydrogena- 
tion reactions. Each dehydrogenation reaction is in turn limited by the rate of elementary steps that dispose of H-atoms 
formed in C-H bond activation steps. The rate of C-H bond activation, recombinative hydrogen desorption, and propane 
chemical conversion have been measured from the rates of isotopic redistribution and chemical conversion during reactions 
of C3Hs/C3D 8 and D2/C3H s mixtures on H-ZSM5, Ga/H-ZSM5, and Zn/H-ZSMS. Isotopic studies show that C-H 
activation steps are fast during steady-state propane dehydrocyclodimerization 
on H-ZSM5, Ga/H-ZSM5, and Zn/H-ZSM5. 
Ga and Zn species increase the rates of propane chemical conversion, recombinative 
hydrogen desorption, and deuterium 
incorporation from D 
2 into reaction products. Disposal of hydrogen formed in C-H bond activation steps occurs by transfer 
of H-atoms to unsaturated species to form alkanes or to Ga and Zn species, which catalyze the recombinative desorption of 
H-atoms to form dihydrogen (H2). The sequential release of several H-atoms during a propane dehydrocyclodimerization 
turnover limits the rate and selectivity of this reaction on H-ZSM5. 
In-situ X-ray absorption studies suggest that Ga and Zn species reside at cation exchange sites as monomeric cations and 
that recombinative desorption involve reduction-oxidation cycles of such cations during each dehydrocyclodimerization 
turnover. These monomeric species form directly during exchange of Zn ions from solution onto H-ZSM5. Ga 
3 
+ species, 
however, do not exchange directly from solution onto H-ZSM5, but instead form extrazeolitic Ga203 crystals. Ion exchange 
occurs during subsequent contact with propane or hydrogen at 700-800 K via vapor phase exchange of volatile Ga

species.

the range of feedstocks available to form these 
useful petrochemicals and fuels. Dehydrocy- 
clodimerization reactions of light alkanes were 
first reported in a series of papers by Csicsery 
[1-5]. These studies showed that the conversion 
of propane to aromatics occurs on Pt/A1203

catalysts with low selectivity (18.7%) at high 
temperatures (833 K). The use of metal-ex- 
changed zeolites to catalyze dehydrocyclodimer- 
ization reactions was first reported by British 
Petroleum researchers [6,7]; these reports dis- 
closed the preferred use of Ga as the exchanged 
cation in H-ZSM5. 
Since these initial reports, many studies have 
focused on the use of medium-pore pentasil 
zeolites. H-ZSM5 catalyzes the conversion of 
light alkanes to aromatics with low selectivity 
because of fast cracking side reactions [8-12]. 
H-ZSM5 catalysts are uniquely resistant to de- 
activation at the high temperature and low hy- 
drogen concentration required for favorable de- 
hydrocyclodimerization thermodynamics. H- 
ZSM5 catalysts also provide the basis for the 
M-forming catalytic reforming process reported 
by Mobil, a process that uses the alkene prod- 
ucts of cracking reactions to alkylate benzene 
and toluene to higher octane aromatics [13,14]. 
The introduction of Ga [15-36], Zn [37-42], 
and Pt [43-47] species into H-ZSM5 increases 
the rate and selectivity of aromatization reac- 
tions and inhibits cracking side reactions that 
lead to loss of carbon to undesirable products. 
These cations, however, also decrease the unique 
stability of H-ZSM5 and lead to significantly 
faster rates of catalyst deactivation during alkane 
dehydrocyclodimerization [29]. This undesired 
side effect of the promotion of H-ZSM5 with 
Ga, Zn, and Pt has led to the recent use of these 
materials in moving-bed reactors in the 
CYCLAR process jointly developed by British 
Petroleum and UOP [48,49]. 
The catalytic role and the structure and loca- 
tion of metal cations in light alkane aromatiza- 
tion remains the subject of intense controversy 
even after significant emphasis and numerous 
publications. Ono and co-workers [15,38] have 
proposed that metal cations catalyze the selec- 
tive conversion of alkenes to aromatics, but do 
not participate in the activation of the light 
alkane reactants. Their proposal is based on the 
observed increase in aromatic synthesis rate and 
selectivity as well as the decrease in the concen- 
tration of intermediate alkenes when Ga is 
added. Guisnet et al. [17,18,24,46] suggest on 
the basis of the higher initial rate of propene 
formation when Ga is added, that metal cations 
are exclusively involved in propane dehydro- 
genation and naphthene dehydrogenation steps, 
while the remaining required reaction steps oc- 
cur via conventional acid catalysis on intraze- 
olitic BrCnsted acid sites. 
Mole et al. [37] proposed that Zn cations in 
H-ZSM5 catalyze the desorption of H-atoms 
formed during C-H bond activation steps as 
H 2, while the remaining required steps occur on 
zeolitic acid sites. This proposal is consistent 
with kinetic and isotopic tracer studies for 
propane reactions on Zn- and Ga-promoted H- 
ZSM5 by Inui et al. [43,50], Le Van Mao et al. 
[19,21,41], and Iglesia et al. [22,26,28,29,42]. 
These studies suggest a synergistic requirement 
for both acid sites, in order to stabilize alkane 
adsorption and C-H bond cleavage, and 'metal' 
sites, in order to dispose of the resulting H- 
atoms. Meitzner et al. [26] and Biscardi et al. 
[42] have reported structural studies of Ga and 
Zn species by X-ray absorption during propane 
aromatization. These studies suggest that hydro- 
gen desorption occurs by the cyclic reduction 
and oxidation of monomeric Zn and Ga species. 
X-ray absorption studies have also detected the 
reduction and migration of Ga species during 
reducing pretreatments and propane reactions 
[26]; this phenomenon has also been suggested 
by the reduction and catalytic measurements of 
Price et al. [20,23]. 
In this review of dehydrocyclodimerization 
catalysis on modified H-ZSM5, we discuss in 
detail the literature evidence for the function 
and the structure of metal cations and of 
BrCnsted acid sites during the dehydrocy- 
clodimerization of light alkanes on modified 
H-ZSM5 zeolites. We also present new mecha- 
nistic evidence for the critical role of hydrogen 
transfer and disposal during the dehydrogena- 
tion and aromatization of these light alkanes.

2. Experimental methods 
2.1. Catalyst synthesis 
impregnated Zn/H-ZSM5 was 2.8 wt% (Zn/A1 
= 0.41). The Ga/H-ZSM5 sample was mea- 
sured to have a Ga content of 2.1 wt% (Ga/A1 
= 0.29). 
Na-ZSM5 (Zeochem, Si/A1 = 14.5) was 
converted to the ammonium form by exchange 
with a 0.67 M solution of ammonium nitrate at 
333 K for 20 h. This sample was exchanged 
again, filtered, washed with deionized water, 
dried at 373 K for 20 h, and calcined at 773 K 
for 20 h in order to convert it to the protonic 
form (H-ZSM5). 
Ga cations were introduced by incipient wet- 
ness impregnation into H-ZSM5 with a 0.065 M 
solution of gallium nitrate, after several unsuc- 
cessful attempts to achieve significant Ga con- 
centrations by ion-exchange. This sample was 
then dried and calcined (773 K, 20 h). These 
Ga/H-ZSM5 catalysts were pretreated in flow- 
ing hydrogen at 773 K for 1 hour before cat- 
alytic reactions. Two Zn/H-ZSM5 samples 
were prepared, one by ion-exchange of H-ZSM5 
with a 0.0065 M solution of zinc nitrate and the 
other by incipient wetness impregnation into 
H-ZSM5 with a 0.0065 M solution of zinc 
nitrate. Each sample was filtered, washed with 
deionized water, dried at 373 K for 20 h, and 
calcined at 773 K for 20 h. 
2.2. Elemental analysis 
The Si and A1 content in H-ZSM5 was mea- 
sured by inductively-coupled plasma atomic 
emission spectroscopy (ICP-AES). The atomic 
Si/A1 ratio in the Zeochem material was 14.5. 
This value remained constant throughout all 
exchange procedures and thermal treatments of 
the samples. The sodium content of H-ZSM5 
was less than 0.15 wt% (as Na). The Zn and Ga 
content in metal-exchanged H-ZSM5 was also 
measured by ICP-AES. The Zn content in ion 
exchanged Zn/H-ZSM5 was 1.3 wt%. Zn, 
which corresponds to a Zn/A1 atomic ratio of 
0.20 in this sample. The Zn content of the 
2.3. X-ray absorption spectroscopy 
The structure and chemical state of Ga and 
Zn species in calcined Ga/H-ZSM5 and Zn/H- 
ZSM5 samples were examined by in-situ X-ray 
absorption spectroscopy at the Ga and Zn K- 
edges. Experimental procedures are described in 
detail elsewhere [26,42]. Ga K-edges were fitted 
by linear combinations of spectra from well 
characterized Ga 
3+ compounds and from Ga 
metal. The resulting best fit gave the fraction of 
the Ga present in various reduced and oxidized 
states [51]. Catalytic tests were conducted dur- 
ing X-ray absorption measurements using an 
in-situ cell design previously described [52]. 
X-ray spectra include sharp increases in ab- 
sorbance at 10368 eV (Ga K-edge) or at 9659 
eV (Zn K-edge), which arise from the ejection 
of Ga (or Zn) l s electrons. The energy region 
near this K-edge contains detailed information 
about the chemical environment, bonding sym- 
metry, and oxidation state of the absorber [53]. 
The extended X-ray absorption fine structure 
(EXAFS) in the energy range slightly above the 
absorption edge (AE= +50 eV) arises from 
scattering of ejected electrons by atoms near the 
absorber. This region contains information on 
the chemical identity and bond distances of 
atoms near the absorber. 
2.4. Catalytic reaction studies 
Kinetic and isotopic tracer studies were car- 
fled out in a gradientless batch reactor consist- 
ing of a shallow packed-bed reactor contained 
within a gas recirculation loop [22]. Reactants 
and products were recirculated at 2-10 cm 
3 s- 
using a graphite gear micropump in order to 
maintain differential reactor conditions (< 2% 
conversion per pass). The reactor was evacuated 
210

/ Catalysis Today 31 (1996)207-231 
by mechanical and diffusion pumps isolated 
from the system by liquid nitrogen traps. The 
chemical and isotopic compositions of reactants 
and products were measured by capillary chro- 
matography 
using 
flame 
ionization 
and 
electron-impact mass spectrometric detection 
methods. Deuterium and carbon-13 content in 
products were determined from mass spectro- 
metric data using matrix techniques that correct 
for ion fragmentation and natural 13C abundance 
[54,55]. 
Undeuterated propane (Matheson, instrument 
purity, > 99.5%), perdeuterated propane (Iso- 
tec, chemical purity > 99.0%, isotopic purity 
> 99.0%), deuterium (Matheson, C.P., chemical 
purity > 99.5%, isotopic purity > 99.0%), and 
propene (Matheson, C.P., > 99.0%) were used 
as reactants without further purification. 2-C 13- 
propane (Cambridge Isotopes, chemical purity 
> 98.0%, isotopic purity > 99.0%) was purged 
by freezing in liquid nitrogen and evacuating 
several times. Hydrogen (Matheson, C.P., > 
99.99%) was purified using an oxygen trap 
(Matheson) followed by a 13X molecular sieve 
trap at room temperature. Helium (> 99.95%) 
was purified using a 13X molecular sieve trap at 
room temperature before use as an inert diluent 
in microreactor studies. 
Propane reaction rates are reported as the 
molar rate of propane conversion per g-atom A1 
in the catalyst charge. This represents a rigorous 
measure of the turnover rate only if A1 sites 
catalyze the rate-determining reaction steps in a 
bifunctional catalytic sequence. It can be easily 
converted to a turnover rate based on Ga or Zn 
species by dividing by the (M/A1) atomic ratio 
in each catalyst sample. Batch reactor data are 
presented as turnovers vs. time plots; their slope 
give turnover rates for the formation of each 
product. Hydrocarbon selectivities are reported 
on a carbon basis as the percentage of the 
converted propane that appears as each reaction 
product. Hydrogen selectivities are similarly re- 
ported as the percentage of the hydrogen in the 
converted propane that appears as various prod- 
ucts, including H 2. 
3. Results and discussion 
3.1. Structure of gallium species during catalyst 
synthesis and reaction 
The beneficial effect of Ga on alkane aroma- 
tization rates and selectivity has been observed 
whether Ga ions are introduced by impregnation 
[16,26,28,29,33,35] or ion exchange techniques 
[15,18,22,23,32]. These effects are even ob- 
served when catalyst precursors consist of 
Ga203/H-ZSM5 
physical mixtures [17,19- 
21,23,36] or of gallosilicates containing Ga 
species within framework positions in the pen- 
tasil structure [56-58]. In all cases, initial acti- 
vation under reducing conditions appears to lead 
to the reduction of Ga 
3+ cations and to their 
migration from either extracrystalline or frame- 
work positions to cation exchange sites within 
zeolite channels [20,26]. In gallosilicates, reduc- 
tion and migration of Ga species requires their 
extraction from framework position at high tem- 
peratures (> 973 K) [58]. 
Ion exchange procedures lead to the preferen- 
tial deposition of Ga 
3+ species on the outer 
surface of zeolite crystals [20,23,26]. It appears 
that hydrated Ga 
3+ cations cannot enter the 
(0.55 × 0.57 nm) elliptical channels in ZSM5 
during impregnation or ion-exchange [59]. Dur- 
ing calcination, these extracrystalline Ga species 
convert to Ga20 3 crystals [20,23,26]. Ga20 3 
reduces during pretreatment with hydrogen or 
during propane reactions at 773 K [20,23,26]. 
These reduced species appear to migrate into 
zeolite channels by surface diffusion processes 
that become possible for reduced Ga species at 
high temperatures. This reduction is confirmed 
by the shift in Ga K-edge energy to lower 
values detected by in-situ X-ray absorption 
measurements on Ga/H-ZSM5 during pretreat- 
ment in H 2 or propane dehydrocyclodimeriza- 
tion [26]. X-ray absorption studies also show 
that these reduced Ga species consist of 
monomeric Ga 
 or Ga 
1 
 compounds [26]. Price 
et al. [20,23] and Meitzner et al. [26] have 
suggested that mobility may be induced by the

/ Catalysis Today 31 (1996)207-231 
211 
reduction of Ga203 to form volatile Ga20 
species. 
Gravimetric studies by Price and co-workers 
[20,23] have also shown that reduction occurs 
during hydrogen treatment by a sequence of 
steps involving the formation of Ga20 from 
GazO 3 and the migration and solid-state ex- 
change between Ga20 and protonic sites within 
zeolite channels (Eqs. (1) and (2)): 
Ga203 + 2H 2  Ga20 + 2H20 
(l) 
Ga20 + 2H + .... Z- 2Ga + .... Z-+ H20 
(2) 
where Z represents oxygen atoms bridging A1 
and Si atoms in the zeolite framework. 
Meitzner et al. [26] have detected by in-situ 
X-ray absorption the re-oxidation of reduced 
Ga 
1+ species to Ga 
3+ species upon cooling to 
room temperature even in H 2 or propane carrier 
gas, suggesting that the active form of Ga species 
can be detected only at reaction conditions. 
We suggest that the steady-state product of 
the reduced Ga are neutral [GaOH] species sta- 
bilized by interactions with basic oxygens within 
ZSM5 channels. These in-situ studies have sug- 
gested a reduction-oxidation mechanism for the 
desorption of H-atoms as H 2 during catalytic 
reactions of propane on Ga/H-ZSM5 (Eq. (3)):

where species (II) may account for the most 
abundant form of Ga detected by in-situ EXAFS 
at reaction conditions. 
3.2. Structure of zinc species during catalyst 
synthesis and reaction 
In contrast with the results on Ga/H-ZSM5, 
Zn ions exchange directly onto intrazeolitic sites 
during contact with zinc nitrate solutions. Zn 
K-edge data were analyzed using Zn foil and 
ZnO as standards in order to detect the exis- 
tence of Zn-Zn and Zn-O nearest neighbors 
and of Zn-Zn next nearest neighbors. These 
X-ray 
studies suggest that ion-exchanged 
Zn/H-ZSM5 (1.3 wt% Zn) contains only Zn-O 
nearest neighbors, suggesting that Zn is present 
as isolated Zn species at zeolitic exchange sites 
[42]. Direct exchange is apparently possible be- 
cause of the smaller coordination sphere of 
divalent cations, such as Zn 
2, compared with 
those of Ga 
3+ cations. 
Impregnation techniques lead to the forma- 
tion of both exchanged Zn cations and of ex- 
tracrystalline ZnO crystals, which can be de- 
tected by transmission electron microscopy and 
by Zn K-edge X-ray absorption [42]. Unlike Zn 
ion exchange, Zn K-edge studies using ZnO as 
a standard, suggest that Zn impregnated H- 
ZSM5 (2.8 wt% Zn) contains a small fraction of 
Zn-Zn next nearest neighbors, consistent with 
the presence of external ZnO crystals. These 
extracrystalline ZnO particles are poorly dis- 
persed and do not significantly contribute to the 
rate of propane conversion or of recombinative 
hydrogen desorption [42]. In fact, impregnated 
Zn/H-ZSM5 (compared to ion exchange) re- 
sults in lower propane conversion turnover rates,

suggesting that these ZnO species, formed dur- 
ing impregnation, may actually block zeolite 
channels and prevent access to some acid sites 
(Table 1). These external ZnO crystals also 
reduce and elute from the bed as gaseous Zn 
atoms during reduction in flowing hydrogen 
[42]. The reduction and vaporization of ex- 
tracrystalline ZnO during reduction and reaction 
is confirmed by the presence of Zn metal films 
and H20 droplets at the reactor exit. In contrast 
with the behavior of Ga203 during reduction, 
ZnO reduction does not appear to lead to migra- 
tion into crystal channels or to solid state reac- 
tions with cation exchange sites, possibly be- 
cause Zn lacks volatile intermediate oxides.

3.3. The effect of metal cations on propane 
conversion rate and selectivity 
Propane conversion turnover rates and selec- 
tivities at similar conversions (8.6-9.6%) on 
H-ZSM5, Ga/H-ZSM5, and Zn/H-ZSM5 are 
shown in Table 2. Turnover rates for aromatics 
formation increase markedly when Zn or Ga are 
introduced within zeolite channels (Fig. 1). The 
selectivity to C6-C 8 aromatics increases from 
3.9% to 35.8% when Zn (1.3 wt%) is ion-ex- 
changed onto H-ZSM5. The hydrogen selectiv- 
ity to H 2 also increases from 4.6 to 30.5% when 
Zn is present (Table 2). 
The presence of Ga or Zn species leads to an 
increase in the rate of H 2 formation via recom- 
binative desorption of H-atoms formed in dehy- 
drogenation steps (Fig. 2). In contrast, H-ZSM5 
disposes of these H-atoms at significantly lower 
rates and predominantly by placing them within 
hydrogen-rich C 1 and C 2 alkanes. On H-ZSM5, 
hydrogen transfer reactions lead to the use of 
carbonaceous intermediates as stoichiometric 
sinks for the removal of the H-atoms formed in 
sequential dehydrogenation steps. Ga and Zn 
sites allow dehydrogenation reactions to occur 
without the requirement for concurrent crack-

channels increase aromatic turnover rates and 
actually decrease cracking turnover rates (Fig. 
3). 
Mole et al. [37] first proposed on the basis of 
product distribution data that a large fraction of 
the H-atoms formed in dehydrogenation steps 
appears as H 2 on Zn/H-ZSM5. They suggested 
that Zn species introduce recombinative desorp- 
tion sites for H-atoms into H-ZSM5 catalysts. 
Our recent isotopic tracer studies confirm this 
proposal [28,29,42]. 
We discuss later in this review three possible 
mechanisms that may account for this beneficial 
effect of metal cations on alkane dehydrocy- 
clodimerization reactions. 
(i) Zn and Ga species catalyze the initial 
dehydrogenation of propane to propene, while 
the remaining acid-catalyzed reactions of alkene 
intermediates occur on BrCnsted acid sites within 
zeolite channels. 
(ii) Zn and Ga species catalyze the recombi- 
native desorption of H-atoms formed in an 
acid-catalyzed C-H bond activation reaction oc- 
curring as a first step in every dehydrogenation 
event required for an aromatization turnover. 
(iii) Selective propane dehydrocyclodimeriza- 
tion occurs exclusively on Ga and Zn catalytic 
sites and the role of the H-ZSM5 component is 
merely to protect these catalytic species against 
sintering and carbon deposits. 
The first two hypotheses require the concur- 
rent presence of acid sites and metal cations 
during reactions for light alkane dehydrocy- 
clodimerization to occur with high selectivity. 
3.4. The mechanism of propane dehydrocy- 
clodimerization on H-ZSM5 zeolites 
Reactions of propane on modified H-ZSM5 
lead to the formation of a broad range of aro- 
matics, alkanes, and alkenes (Table 2), suggest- 
ing the involvement of a complex reaction se- 
quence. Aromatic products consist of a mixture 
of benzene, toluene, xylenes, and larger aromat- 
ics; the formation of these products requires 
several chain growth (oligomerization) and 
cracking events before aromatization. These 
oligomerization-cracking reactions lead to the 
formation of an 'equilibrated' mixture of unsat- 
urated intermediates [60,61]. Cyclization and 
aromatization pathways become available as 
these intermediates acquire more than five car- 
bon atoms. 
Dehydrocyclodimerization reaction pathways 
have been extensively discussed in the literature 
primarily on the basis of observed effects of 
catalyst composition on reaction rate and selec- 
tivity. Recently, we have obtained more direct 
214

evidence for the sequence of steps using iso- 
topic 
tracer 
and 
exchange 
methods 
[22,26,28,29,42]. 
These methods have estab- 
lished the nature and the rate of individual 
reaction steps in this reaction sequence. 
The initial propene intermediate, formed by 
dehydrogenation of propane, undergoes acid- 
catalyzed chain growth reactions within zeolite 
channels by oligomerization or addition to C 3 + 
carbocations. As the alkene chain lengthens, 
13-scission reactions become faster and ulti- 
mately establish a 'quasi-equilibrated' pool of 
alkene intermediates with a broad size distribu- 
tion [60,61]. These alkene intermediates con- 
tinue to undergo hydrogenation-dehydrogena- 
tion reactions, commonly described as hydrogen 
transfer, in which light alkenes accept hydrogen 
to form alkanes. C 6 + alkenes tend to dehydro- 
genate and cyclize to kinetically-stable and ther- 
modynamically-favored aromatic products. 
Cracking of larger chains also occurs with the 
concomitant removal of hydrogen by its addi- 
tion to light alkene products of cracking reac- 
tions. These individual mechanistic proposals 
suggest that propane dehydrocyclodimerization 
occurs via a complex sequence of dehydrogena- 
tion, oligomerization, cracking, and cyclization 
steps (Scheme 1). Below, we describe the exper- 
imental evidence for the role and rate of these 
individual steps during propane dehydrocy- 
clodimerization. 
3.5. Isotopic tracer studies of the initial forma- 
tion of propene reactive intermediates

propane and the intermediate and reactive na-

composition of reaction products formed from 
reactions of unlabeled propene and propane-2- 
13C. The 13C content in reaction products can be 
used to calculate the relative rates of propane 
and propene reactions and the fraction of the 
initial products (before isotopic scrambling 
within the reactant mixture) formed directly 
from either propane or propene molecules. 
The isotopic content in reactants and prod- 
ucts is shown in Figs. 4-6. On H-ZSM5, the 
t3C content in propane decreases with increas- 
ing conversion (and contact time) because the 
pure propane-2-13C reactant is diluted by the 
unlabeled products of propene hydrogenation 
(Fig. 4). The ]3C content in propene increases 
with contact time because the initially unlabeled 
alkene is diluted by the labeled products of 
propane dehydrogenation. The aromatics and 
cracking products are initially unlabeled, consis- 
tent with their direct formation from the unla- 
beled propene in the feed. The isotopic content

in these products increases in parallel with that 
in propene, because they are formed from in- 
creasingly enriched propene. 
The 13C content is very similar in ethylene 
and propene products. Therefore, it appears that 
these reaction products are formed from a com- 
mon pool of alkene intermediates and not from 
propane as expected from direct propane crack- 
ing. The 3C content in toluene and benzene is 
slightly lower than in propene because of the 
fast initial formation of unlabeled large alkene 
intermediates, which are diluted slowly with 
time as the products of the enriched propane 
reactant begin to contribute to the observed 
products. On H-ZSM5, all aromatic products 
form only from propene, as shown by the lack 
of 3C enrichment in initial reaction products 
(Fig. 4). These data show that alkenes are re- 
quired intermediates in the conversion of 
propane on H-ZSM5 [42]. 
The addition of Ga (Fig. 5) and Zn (Fig. 6) to 
H-ZSM5 does not appear to perturb these reac- 
tion pathways. Initial reaction products do not 
contain 3C and are formed predominantly from 
unlabeled propene molecules in the feed mix- 
ture. The rate of 3C scrambling between 
propane-2-13C and unlabelled propene, how- 
ever, is influenced by the presence of Ga and 
Zn. For example, the 3C-content in propane

decreases more slowly with increasing contact 
time on Zn/H-ZSM5 (Fig. 6) and on Ga/H- 
ZSM5 (Fig. 5) than on H-ZSM5 (Fig. 4), sug- 
gesting that the rate of propene 'hydrogenation' 
to propane decreases when Ga and Zn are added. 
This observation appears to contradict the ex- 
pectation that metal cations would increase the 
rate of alkane dehydrogenation and of its re- 
verse reaction (alkene hydrogenation). As we 
discuss below, this apparent contradiction arises 
because Ga and Zn cations also increase the rate 
of propene conversion to aromatics, a reaction 
that requires several sequential dehydrogenation 
steps, even more than they increase the rate of 
propane dehydrogenation to propene. 
The rate of isotopic scrambling between 
propane-2-13C and unlabeled propene and the 
isotopic content of chemical reaction products 
can be used to calculate the relative rates of 
propene hydrogenation (r 1) and conversion to 
other products (r 2) (Eq. (4)). In effect, one can 
obtain r 2 and r  values at various levels of 
conversion for H-ZSM5, Zn/H-ZSM5, and 
Ga/H-ZSM5 from these experimental results. 
The (r_l/r 2) values for all three catalysts are 
shown in Fig. 7. This ratio is almost indepen- 
dent of conversion (contact time). The values of 
(r_/r 2) extrapolated to zero conversion are

quent dehydrogenation steps that must occur to 
convert propene intermediates to aromatic prod-

On all three catalysts, the (r_l/r 2) ratio is 
less than unity (0.02-0.55), consistent with a 
non-equilibrated initial dehydrogenation step. In 
effect, this step becomes even more irreversible 
(r_l/r 2 decreases) when Ga or Zn are intro- 
duced into H-ZSM5 catalysts, because required 
subsequent dehydrogenation reactions are more 
strongly influenced by these cations than the 
initial dehydrogenation reaction. 
Carbocations are surface reactive intermedi- 
ates (or at least activated complexes) in reac- 
tions catalyzed by Brensted acid sites [62]. The 
two major mechanistic routes proposed for 
alkane conversion over H-ZSM5 involve the 
activation of propane by hydride abstraction 
from the reacting alkane by adsorbed carbenium 
ions (bimolecular) or by addition of protons to 
alkenes to form a carbenium ion (monomolecu- 
lar) [63]. Reactions of propane-2-13C and unla- 
beled propene over H-ZSM5 were conducted to 
examine the relative contributions these mecha- 
nistic routes during propane dehydrocyclodimer- 
ization on H-ZSM5. Bimolecular reaction path- 
ways would result in an increase in propane 
conversion turnover rates when propene is added 
to the propane reactants. If the rate of propane 
conversion remains unchanged when propene is 
added, the reaction proceeds via a monomolecu- 
lar mechanism. Turnover rates for propane-2- 
13C conversion were found to be not catalyzed 
by the addition of unlabelled propene to 
propane-2-13C mixtures over H-ZSM5 (Fig. 8). 
This suggests that reactions of propane form 
carbocations via a monomolecular route. This 
also precludes the possibility that trace amounts 
of alkenes catalyze the initial activation of 
propane by providing C 3 + 
carbocations as 
chain initiators. 
An alternate monomolecular mechanism ap- 
pears to be favored at high temperatures and 
low pressures [63] and leads to the direct proto- 
nation of a propane molecule to form carbonium 
ions (C3H-). This adsorption step is followed 
by carbonium ion decomposition into C3H - 
and H 2 or C2H - and CH 4. Our isotopic studies 
support the activation of propane by a 
monomolecular route (Fig. 8), but provide no 
evidence for carbonium ion intermediates. On 
the contrary, H 2 produced during propane dehy-

drocyclodimerization does not directly correlate 
with the propene produced over H-ZSM5, as 
expected by the mechanism proposed by Haag 
[63]. The lower than stoichiometric H 2 produc- 
tion may result from dissociative re-adsorption 
of H 2 and hydrogenation of alkene intermedi- 
ates into alkanes. Isotopic evidence by Iglesia 
and 
co-workers 
[22,26,28,29,42] 
using 
C3Hs/D 2 mixtures, however, confirms that the 
dissociative adsorption of gas phase deuterium 
over H-ZSM5 is minimal. Thus, our studies do 
not support the involvement of carbonium ion 
intermediates in propane dehydrocyclodimeriza- 
tion. 
3.6. Formation and scission of carbon-carbon 
bonds 
Reactions of positionally labeled alkanes can 
be used to study the mechanism of cyclization 
reactions [55,64,65]. Specifically, the analysis 
of the content and location of 13C in the prod- 
ucts of propane-2-13C reactions can establish 
the reaction pathways required for conversion of 
propene intermediates to stable aromatic prod- 
ucts. For example, a simple cyclization of two 
propene-2-13C molecules formed from propane- 
2- 3C would lead to benzene-l,4-13C. 
On H-ZSM5, all products of propane-2-13C 
reactions contain a binomial distribution of 
3C-atoms, instead of the expected single iso- 
topomer, even at very low conversions (Fig. 9). 
Disappointingly, all information on the location 
and content of 13C-atoms in the propane-2-3C 
is lost during a dehydrocyclodimerization 
turnover on H-ZSM5. The 13C atoms have ex- 
changed positions not only within a single C 3 
moiety, but among several. In effect, C-C bonds 
in propane have been broken and re-formed 
within a C 3 fragment and within much larger 
surface chains many times (> 10) in the time 
required 
for 
a 
dehydrocyclodimerization 
turnover. Such a turnover requires the formation 
of a C 6 or larger molecule, a process that 
involves oligomerization reactions, but also a 
significant number of cracking and rapid methyl

shift events. These oligomerization-cracking 
and isomerization reactions quickly establish an 
'equilibrated' alkene mixture that is independent 
of the size of the alkene reactant [60,61]. Both 
chain length and methyl group position appear 
to reach equilibrium values. Another possible 
mechanism, recently proposed to explain similar 
scrambling during methanol conversion to light 
alkenes on H-ZSM5, involves the addition of 
alkenes directly to large carbocations, followed 
by [3-scission without termination of the carbo- 
cation chain [66]. The broad carbon number 
distribution within aromatic products of propane 
reactions on H-ZSM5 (Table 2) is also consis- 
tent with extensive C-C bond formation and 
cleavage during dehydrocyclodimerization reac- 
tions. 
Products of 2-13C propane reactions on 1.3% 
Zn/H-ZSM5 and 2.1% Ga/H-ZSM5 contain 
sharper 13C distributions, with the predominant 
presence of benzene containing the expected 
two 13C atoms (Fig. 9) [42]. Therefore, Ga and 
Zn ions increase the rate of removal of alkenes 
from these oligomerization-cracking cycles. 
This removal must occur by the formation of 
products, such as aromatics (and H 2) and alka- 
nes, which are much less reactive than alkenes 
in acid-catalyzed reactions. The observed effect 
of Ga and Zn on dehydrocyclodimerization se- 
lectivity (Table 2) suggests that the stable prod- 
ucts formed by these faster removal pathways 
are predominantly aromatics and H 2.

3.7. Isotopic exchange in C3H8/C3D 
8 mix- 
tures and C-H bond activation rates 
Propane dehydrocyclodimerization reactions 
appear to involve a sequence of irreversible 
dehydrogenation reactions with interspersed 
rapid acid-catalyzed reactions that lead to chain 
lengthening and occasional ring closure. Each 
alkane dehydrogenation reaction involves at 
least two elementary reaction steps: the activa- 
tion of C-H bonds and the disposal of the 
H-atoms formed in this reaction. The relative 
rates of C-H bond activation and hydrogen 
disposal can be independently measured during 
propane dehydrocyclodimerization by concur- 
rent measurements of the isotopic content in 
products and reactants during reactions of 
C3H8/D 2 or Calls/CaD 8 mixtures [26,42]. 
For example, the cross exchange of D-atoms 
between C3H 8 and C3D 8 allows the measure- 
ment of the rate of C-H bond activation. The 
rapid appearance of C3H8_xDx 
molecules 
shows that reversible (quasi-equilibrated) C-H 
bond activation occurs during reaction; the rate 
of this reaction can be measured from the mole 
fraction of each propane isotopomer (C3H 8, 
C3HTD1, C3H6D 2 
.... C3D 8) as a function of 
contact time in a gradientless batch reactor. This 
rate (reported as a turnover rate on the basis of 
A1 atoms in ZSM5) was measured using 
C3H8/C3D 8 reactant mixtures on all three cata- 
lysts. The reversibility of this C-H activation 
step can be determined by comparing the rate of 
C-H bond activation to the overall propane 
conversion turnover rate. The propane conver- 
sion turnover rate is measured from the total

and C 3

Significant cross exchange between C3H 8 and 
C3D 8 on H-ZSM5 occurs even at low chemical 
conversion levels (Fig. 
10). C3H8/C3D 8 
cross-exchange occurs by stepwise transfer of 
single D or H-atoms, leading to statistical iso- 
topomer distributions in both the mostly un- 
deuterated and mostly deuterated components in 
'unreacted' propane. Comparison of the rates of 
C-H bond activation and propane chemical 
conversion to products on H-ZSM5 suggests 
that C-H bond activation occurs much faster 
than propane conversion (Table 3). Thus, the 
C-H bond activation step is quasi-equilibrated 
and it does not limit the rate of the overall 
chemical conversion of propane on H-ZSM5. 
These data suggest that H-ZSM5 can activate 
C-H bonds very effectively, but it cannot dis-

pose rapidly of the hydrogen atoms formed in 
C-H bond cleavage. Thus, H-atoms are used to 
rehydrogenate and desorb carbenium ions from 
the surface. These data are consistent with the 
high (r_ Jr z) ratios on H-ZSM5 compared with 
those on Ga and Zn modified samples because 
propane formation is one of these rehydrogena- 
tion reactions. Ga and Zn species remove H- 
atoms as H 2 and prevent these rehydrogenation 
reactions. 
The presence of Ga and Zn species within 
zeolite channels leads to much higher propane 
conversion rates and aromatics selectivity (Ta- 
ble 2, Fig. 1). Yet, C3Hs/C3D 8 exchange data 
show that C-H bond activation rates on H- 
ZSM5 appear to be similar to those on Ga/H- 
ZSM5 and Zn/H-ZSM5 (Table 3, Fig. 11) [42]. 
Thus, the rate of C-H bond cleavage cannot 
limit the overall reaction rate, because the addi- 
tion of Ga and Zn markedly increases the latter 
without dramatically increasing the rate of C-H 
bond activation. Surprisingly, C-H bond activa- 
tion rates are independent of the addition of 
metal cations and appears to occur on Br0nsted 
acid sites. This is supported by the lack of 
C3H8/C3D 8 cross exchange over Na-ZSM5, 
which lacks such BrCnsted acid sites. These two 
independent findings confirm the requirement 
for acid-catalyzed C-H bond activation in 
propane dehydrocyclodimerization 
reactions and 
the presence of a similar number of Br0nsted 
acid sites on all catalysts. 
H/D 
ratios in the reaction products of 
CaHs/C3D 8 mixtures provide indirect evi- 
dence for the relative rates of C-H bond activa- 
tion and C-D bond activation (kinetic isotope 
effect). This information is obtained from the 
deuterium content in the unreacted propane mix- 
ture and from the deuterium content within 
reaction products. The ratio of the deuterium 
content in initial unreacted propane to the deu- 
terium content in reaction products is related to 
the relative rate of which a C-H and C-D bond 
cleave. This C-H/C-D 
kinetic isotope effect 
(extrapolated to zero conversion) is 1.03 on 
H-ZSM5 and 1.2 on Ga/H-ZSM5 (Fig. 12). 
The lack of a kinetic isotope effect (1.03) on 
H-ZSM5 may be explained as follows. The rate 
of C-H activation from C3H 8 is greater than 
C-D activation from CaD 8 due to the weaker 
C-H bond, but simultaneously, an unsaturated 
hydrocarbon would rather form a bond with an 
adsorbed D-atom than a H-atom. In other words, 
the breaking of the weaker C-H bond is accom- 
panied by the formation of a stronger bond and 
in turn, canceling any observed kinetic isotope 
effect. 
The appearance of a kinetic isotope effect 
(1.2) on Ga/H-ZSM5 is attributed to the ability 
for Ga species to recombine H-atoms. Unlike on

H-ZSM5, the recombinative desorption of H- 
atoms and D-atoms on Ga/H-ZSM5 plays an 
important role. On Ga/H-ZSM5, the rate of 
C-H and C-D bond activation is similar to that 
on H-ZSM5, but the removal of H-atoms and 
D-atoms can, along with hydrogen transfer to 
unsaturated hydrocarbon fragments, can also be 
achieved by the recombinative desorption of 
these H- and D-atoms. This alternate H-disposal 
pathway can lead to a hydrogen surface pool 
which is not representative of the true H/D 
ratio due to the preferential desorption of D- 
atoms, which would leave a higher H/D ratio 
on the surface. This suggestion would lead to 
the observed normal kinetic isotope effect be- 
cause an unsaturated hydrocarbon molecule 
would have a higher probability of forming a 
bond with a H-atom due to the greater H/D 
ratio on the surface.

The reversibility of the recombinative desorp-

propane using C3H8/D 2 mixtures as reactants 
[22,28,29,42]. A quasi-equilibrated desorption 
step would lead to complete mixing of D-atoms

reaction products. These quasi-equilibrated ad- 
sorption-desorption steps would occur many 
times in the time required for one dehydrocy- 
clodimerization turnover. In contrast, an irre- 
versible recombinative desorption step would 
lead to the predominant presence of protium in 
reaction products because of the slow communi- 
cation between gas phase (D 2) and surface pools 
of hydrogen isotopes. 
On H-ZSM5, the deuterium content is very 
low in all products of C3H8/D 2 reactions (Fig. 
13), suggesting that recombinative desorption 
steps are irreversible during propane dehydrocy- 
clodimerization. The deuterium content is simi- 
lar in all reaction products and it is almost 
independent of contact time (and conversion). 
Also, D-atoms are distributed statistically within 
each reaction product (Fig. 14). In other words, 
the distribution of D-atoms isotopomers within 
each product formed on H-ZSM5 obeys a bino- 
mial distribution because multiple exchange 
events with a common surface hydrogen pool 
occur during the formation of each reaction 
product. 
This binomial distribution and similar D-con- 
tent within all products suggest that all products 
accurately probe by multiple exchange with a 
well-mixed surface hydrogen pool with an iso- 
topic composition of about 2-4% D and 96- 
98% H. The presence and statistical sampling of 
this well-mixed surface pool is consistent with

the oligomerization-cracking cycle that causes 
the rapid intermolecular scrambling of propane- 
2-13C products. Within this cycle, C-H and 
C-C bonds are broken and re-formed many 
times in their reaction path to products and their 
C-H bonds exchange thoroughly with surface 
hydrogen available as atoms, protons, or hy- 
drides, or within carbocations. As a result, the 
deuterium content within reaction products be- 
comes an accurate measure of the deuterium 
content within the surface hydrogen pool and of 
the rate of communication between this pool 
and a gas phase form of hydrogen. 
The deuterium fraction within all reaction 
products is between 0.018-0.04 on H-ZSM5 
and it is almost independent of contact time 
[28,42]. Therefore, the surface hydrogen pool 
initially contains between 2-4% deuterium and 
96-98% protium, instead of the pure deuterium 
expected from full equilibration with the pure 
D 2 gas phase (Table 4). This surface pool con- 
tains predominantly protium atoms formed in 
C-H bond activation steps; the removal of these 
protium atoms limits the rate of the required 
dehydrogenation reactions. As a result, products 
re-acquire H-atoms instead of D-atoms in the 
fast and reversible C-H bond activation steps 
that occur during propane conversion reactions. 
On H-ZSM5, the predominant hydrogen dis- 
posal pathway is by 'attachment' of H-atoms to 
surface hydrocarbon fragments, in steps that 
predominantly crack and hydrogenate these 
fragments and lead to hydrogen-rich light alka- 
nes. 
Deuterium atoms are also distributed statisti- 
cally and the deuterium content is very similar 
within all products of C3H8/D 2 mixtures on 
Zn/H-ZSM5 and Ga/H-ZSM5 (Figs. 15 and 
16), even though aromatic products are formed 
after a shorter residence time in oligomeriza- 
tion-cracking cycles. The deuterium fraction 
within all products, however, is much higher 
than on H-ZSM5 (e.g. toluene, Fig. 17). The 
deuterium fraction in toluene, obtained by ex- 
trapolation of the data in Fig. 17 to zero conver- 
sion, are 0.25 on Zn/H-ZSM5, 0.13 on Ga/H-

the D-content decreases as conversion increases 
because protium dilutes the deuterium content 
of the gas phase as deuterated reaction products 
are formed. Indeed, gas phase H 2 and HD are 
much more abundant and communicate more 
effectively with the reaction products when Ga 
and Zn are present in H-ZSM5 catalysts. 
The addition of metal cations also increases 
the deuterium content in 'unreacted' propane 
(Fig. 18). The rate of incorporation of D-atoms 
into 'unreacted' propane provides an indepen- 
dent measure of the D-content in the surface 
pool [22,28,29,42]. Deuteration turnovers are

atoms. The addition of Ga and Zn increase the 
deuterium incorporation turnovers (Fig. 19). 
These turnovers reflect the rate of the reverse 
C-H bond activation step (r_ 1) weighed by the 
probability that the hydrogen atom chosen from 
the surface pool to re-form the C-H bond is a 
D-atom. Ga and Zn cations increase propene 
hydrogenation rates (r_l), 
however, these 
species increase r 2 proportionally more than 
r_ 1, because of their promoting effect on subse- 
quent dehydrogenation steps required to form 
aromatics from propylene. Therefore, Ga and 
Zn cations promote not only propane dehydro- 
genation, but even more effectively the subse- 
quent removal of hydrogen as H 2 in reactions 
leading to the formation of highly unsaturated 
precursors (dienes, trienes, and cyclodienes) in- 
volved in cyclization steps. 
Clearly, Ga and Zn species increase the re- 
versibility of H-atom recombinative desorption 
steps and act as efficient 'portholes' [67] for the 
removal of H-atoms produced during C-H bond 
activation steps. Ga and Zn species increase the 
rate of both H-atom recombinative desorption 
and of H 2 
dissociative adsorption during 
propane dehydrocyclodimerization reactions 
[22,28,29,42]. 
Adsorption-desorption steps, 
however, remain irreversible and not fully equi- 
librated even on Ga/H-ZSM5 and Zn/H- 
ZSM5. This H-atom disposal step remains the

223 
rate-determining step for each sequential dehy- 
drogenation reaction required to convert propane 
to aromatics. This is confirmed by the signifi- 
cant presence of protium within the surface pool 
during reactions of C3Hs/D 2 mixtures on 
Ga/H-ZSM5 
and Zn/H-ZSM5. Concurrent 
cracking steps are no longer required to remove 
most H-atoms formed in C-H bond activation 
steps and the selectivity to C6-C 8 aromatic 
products consequently increases when Ga or Zn 
'portholes' are placed within H-ZSM5 channels. 
Dent and Kokes [68] have previously shown 
that H 2 dissociates on Zn-O pairs during ethy- 
lene hydrogenation reactions on zinc oxide. 
Therefore, Zn cations must catalyze also the 
reverse of this process - the desorption of 
hydrogen during dehydrogenation reactions. 
Hydrogen appears to dissociate heterolytically 
with the partial reduction of the Zn 
2 
 cations in 
ZnO. Thus, it is tempting to conclude that des- 
orption during propane dehydrogenation on 
Zn/H-ZSM5 involves the recombination of H  
and H - species and the concomitant re-oxida- 
tion of partially reduced Zn cations. Therefore, 
Zn (and Ga) cations within zeolite channels may 
act as momentary hydrogen acceptors that can 
dispose of the hydrogen by recombination with 
H-atoms stabilized by basic framework oxygens 
in H-ZSM5. 
3.9. Availability of acid sites during propane 
reactions on H-ZSM5 and Ga / H-ZSM5 
The presence of cationic Ga (and Zn) species 
within zeolite channels may displace protons 
and thus reduce the number of sites available 
for acid-catalyzed reactions. Several titration and 
probe reaction studies on H-ZSM5 and Ga/H- 
ZSM5, however, suggest that the density of acid 
sites does not decrease as metal loading in- 
creases within H-ZSM5 channels. For example, 
measurements 
of 
ammonia 
adsorption 
[15,16,18], n-alkane cracking rates [15,18,32], 
and m-xylene, cyclohexene, and 2-methyl-2- 
pentene isomerization rates [18,26,32] support 
this conclusion. One possible reason is that Ga 
species have not exchanged during synthesis 
and remain as extracrystalline Ga203 or Ga20. 
In at least one of the studies cited above [26], 
however, the exchange has been verified inde- 
pendently by Ga K-edge X-ray absorption meth- 
ods. 
In contrast, 
Meriaudeau 
and Naccache 
[25,34,69] have reported a significant decrease 
in the intensity of O-H infrared bands when Ga 
is present within H-ZSM5 channels. These stud- 
ies were performed at room temperature and 
suggest a displacement of protons by Ga cations 
during pretreatment. Kwak and Sachtler [27] 
detected the evolution of HC1 during vapor 
phase exchange of H-ZSM5 with GaC13 caused 
by the exchange of Ga cations for protons. 
Kwak and Sachtler [31] also found that propane 
conversion rates initially increase with Ga con- 
tent, but ultimately decreased as the Ga content 
reached Ga/A1 values near 0.5. These findings 
may have been influenced by channel blockages 
at high metal loadings due to a different synthe- 
sis technique, which involved the chemical va- 
por deposition of GaC13 into ZSM5 channels. 
Meitzner et al. [26] found the ammonia ad- 
sorption on H 2 pretreated Ga/H-ZSM5 also 
leads to a decrease in acid sites compared with 
H-ZSM5. This is contrary to previous re- 
searchers [ 
15,16,18], who report a constant den- 
sity of acid sites using ammonia adsorption. 
These several authors [ 
15,16,18] did not pretreat 
Ga/H-ZSM5 samples with hydrogen before ad- 
sorption measurements and Ga species are un- 
likely to reside within zeolite channels, but as 
extrazeolitic Ga203. Meitzner et al. [26] con- 
firmed this finding by showing no decrease in 
Br0nsted acid site density on non-pretreated 
Ga/H-ZSM5 catalysts during ammonia adsorp- 
tion. 
The reduction of Ga species and the accom- 
panying formation of protons during reaction 
above 573 K may be responsible for these con- 
tradictory results. Specifically, Meriaudeau et 
al. [25,34,69] show that Ga cations replace pro- 
tons by measuring the decreased intensity of 
O-H infrared vibrations at room temperature. 
224 
J.A. Biscardi, E. Iglesia / Catalysis Today 31 (1996) 207-231 
Indeed, independent X-ray absorption studies 
[26] confirm the formation of oxidized Ga 
3+ 
cationic complexes upon cooling samples to 
room temperature. Reduction treatments above 
573 K, however, reduce Ga 
3 
 complexes to Ga 
 
or Ga 
1+; this reduction process occurs without 
water evolution and leads to the formation of 
H + species [26]. Thus, it appears that the addi- 
tion of Ga and Zn species to H-ZSM5 does not 
decrease the density of acid sites at reaction 
conditions, but leads to a displacement of pro- 
tons by oxidized Ga complexes near room tem- 
perature. 
Dehydrocyclodimerization rate and selectiv- 
ity increase as Ga atoms are transferred from 
extrazeolitic oxide crystals to isolated cation 
exchange sites [26]. Clearly, the proximity to 
acid sites, the high metal dispersion, and possi- 
bly the unique electronic structure of isolated 
Ga species induced by this migration improve 
the effectiveness of the catalytic hydrogen des- 
orption function provided by Ga. In addition, 
the isolation of Ga species within zeolite chan- 
nels prevents the formation of polymeric Ga 
metal, which would elute from the reactor as a 
liquid during catalysis above room temperature. 
The reduction of Ga cations residing at in- 
trazeolitic exchange sites can restore BrCnsted 
acid sites by the formation of protons during H 2 
pretreatment or catalytic reactions of light alka- 
nes (Eq. (3)). This proposal suggests that cation 
exchange sites can be used for anchoring 
monomeric Ga species during synthesis, but 
protonic acid sites can be re-formed by appro- 
priate reduction treatments or by the reductive 
environment during 
propane 
dehydrocy- 
clodimerization. The reduction-oxidation of in- 
trazeolitic Ga species has been confirmed by the 
X-ray absorption studies described in a previous 
report [26]. The adsorption-desorption process 
that accompanies this redox cycle has been 
detected by measurements of the appearance 
and disappearance of dihydrogen from the gas 
phase during thermal treatment of a Ga/H- 
ZSM5 sample previously pre-reduced in H 2 at 
773 K for 4 h and cooled to room temperature. 
Hydrogen adsorption-desorption data are 
consistent with Ga K-edge X-ray absorption 
data, which show Ga 
3 
+ forms during cooling of 
reduced samples to room temperature. During 
catalytic reaction of propane at 673-773 K, 
Ga 
3+ reduces to its active form (Ga 
1+) in a 
process that occurs along with a significant 
increase in the rate of propane dehydrocy- 
clodimerization reactions. 
The cationic Ga complexes in exchange sites 
at room temperature must be present with a + 1 
charge, regardless of the formal oxidation state 
of the Ga atoms. This is required by the need to 
balance the net negative charge of a single 
cation exchange site isolated by significant dis- 
tances from other exchange sites within zeolite 
channels. This is likely to lead to the formation 
of species such as [GaO] +, where strongly bound 
oxygen atoms provide the required charge bal- 
ance for Ga 
3+ ions exchanged during contact 
with Ga nitrate solution. 
3.10. 
Synergy 
between metal cation 
and 
BrCnsted acid sites in dehydrocyclodimerization 
reactions 
Most literature reports suggest that propane 
dehydrocyclodimerization proceeds via a bi- 
functional route requiring the metal and acid 
sites to catalyze specific and distinct steps within 
the reaction sequence. The functions are C-C 
bond formation and cleavage, C-H bond activa- 
tion, and hydrogen disposal. On H-ZSM5, hy- 
drogen disposal proceeds by hydrogen transfer 
to hydrocarbon fragments, a process that leads 
to high cracking selectivities. On Ga/H-ZSM5 
and Zn/H-ZSM5, hydrogen disposal proceeds 
predominantly through the recombinative des- 
orption of H-atoms to form H 2. 
C3H8/C3D 8 isotopic exchange data have 
shown that C-H bond activation steps are fast 
and quasi-equilibrated 
during 
steady-state 
propane dehydrocyclodimerization on H-ZSM5, 
Ga/H-ZSM5, and Zn/H-ZSM5. The C-H bond 
activation rate is independent of the presence of 
Ga and Zn cations and appears to occur on 
J.A. Biscardi, E. Iglesia / Catalysis Today 31 (1996) 207-231 
225 
BrOnsted acid sites within zeolite channels. Ad- 
ditionally, C3H8/D 2 exchange data suggest that 
the turnover rate for hydrogen desorption in- 
creases with Ga or Zn introduction into ZSM5 
channels and that this step is essentially irre- 
versible during steady-state catalysis. These two 
independent findings provide evidence that 
propane dehydrogenation to propene is a con- 
certed reaction requiring both acid sites and 
metal cation sites. The acid sites activate C-H 
bonds, while the metal sites remove the hydro- 
gen species formed in these C-H bond cleavage 
steps via recombinative desorpfion of H-atoms 
as dihydrogen (Hz). This metal recombinative 
desorption function removes the hydrogen bot- 
tleneck on the surface and allows acid sites to 
turnover more efficiently without the require- 
ment of hydrogen transfer and cracking reac- 
tions to form H-rich products. It also prevents 
the reversal of the initial C-H bond activation 
by rehydrogenation of surface species to re-form 
propane. 
The oligomerization and cracking of light 
alkenes during propane dehydrocyclodimeriza- 
tion occurs readily on acid sites. Light alkenes 
can be converted to a mixture of lower and 
higher molecular weight alkenes via a sequence 
of acid-catalyzed shape-selective oligomeriza- 
tion and isomerization reactions over H-ZSM5 
[60,61]. 
The aromatization of cycloalkenes formed 
after oligomerization and cyclization steps may 
also require a concerted reaction between acid 
and metal cation sites. The role of metal cations 
during reactions of methylcyclohexane on H- 
ZSM5 and Ga/H-ZSM5 is consistent with the 
significant hydrogen removal requirements of 
such reactions. Methylcyclohexane turnover 
rates and selectivities on H-ZSM5 and Ga/H- 
ZSM5 are shown in Table 5. The selectivity to 
toluene increases from 29.5 to 40.3% with the 
introduction of Ga (2.1 wt%) into H-ZSM5 
channels. The selectivity to H 2 also increases 
from 18.2 to 26.4% when Ga is present. The 
increase in hydrogen formation rate shows that 
Ga participates in the dehydrogenation of cy- 
cloalkanes by disposing of hydrogen via recom- 
binative desorption of surface H-atoms as H 2. 
3.11. Role of the Ga and Zn cations during 
propane dehydrocyclodimerization on H-ZSM5 
In a previous section, we mentioned three 
possible functions of exchanged metal cations, 
all of which have been proposed on the basis of 
literature results. Ono et al. [15,38] have pro- 
posed that Ga is not required for the initial 
activation of propane, but merely catalyzes the 
conversion of unsaturated intermediates to aro- 
matics. This cyclization function was proposed 
on the basis of the observed decrease in inter- 
mediate alkene selectivities caused by the pres- 
ence of Ga. 
Our studies have confirmed the lower propene 
selectivity and the higher rate of propene aroma- 
tization on Ga/H-ZSM5 catalysts. We con- 
clude, however, that Ga species also increase 
markedly the rate of propane conversion to 
propene. For example, the rate of propane con- 
version (to all products) (Fig. 20) increases by a

factor of 7, while the rate of propene conversion 
(to all products) (Fig. 21) increases by a factor 
of 4 when Ga is added to H-ZSM5. These 
results are consistent with a hydrogen desorp- 
tion function provided by Ga species and do not 
require the proposal of a Ga-catalyzed cycliza- 
tion reaction. In effect, the conversion of 
propene to aromatics also requires a sequence of 
several additional dehydrogenation steps that 
are limited by the disposal of H-atoms in re- 
combinative desorption or hydrogen transfer re- 
actions. 
Additional evidence for Ga and Zn playing a 
role in propene dehydrocyclodimerization is ob- 
tained by concurrent measurements of the rate 
of propene hydrogenation (r_ t) and conversion 
to products (r 2) (Eq. (4)) during reactions of 
propene/propane-2-13C mixtures. These data 
show that r_l/r 2 is much lower on Ga/H- 
ZSM5 and Zn/H-ZSM5 than on H-ZSM5 (Fig. 
7). Thus, the introduction of Ga and Zn in 
zeolite channels increase r 2 proportionally more 
than it increases r_ ]. The catalytic effect of Ga 
and Zn is stronger on propene conversion reac- 
tions than on propene formation from propane, 
consistent with the expected requirement for 
several additional hydrogen desorption in order 
to complete a propene aromatization turnover. 
Meriaudeau et al. [25] and Guisnet et al. 
[17,18,24,46] have suggested that Ga species 
provide only a propane and naphthene dehydro- 
genation function, while all subsequent reac- 
tions of propene proceed exclusively and rapidly 
on protonic acid sites via conventional acid 
catalysis. Guisnet et al. [17] state that Ga20 3 
shows 'great activity' for propane dehydrogena- 
tion to propene. Meriaudeau and Naccache [70] 
and Buckles and Hutchings [36] have also ex-

amined the dehydrogenation activity of Ga203. 
Dehydrogenation turnover rates on Ga203 and 
on Ga/H-ZSM5 were calculated from the re- 
ported literature. Ga203 catalyzes propane de- 
hydrogenation, but the dehydrogenation turnover 
rate on Ga/H-ZSM5 is more than 10 times 
greater than the observed reactions rates on 
Ga203 (Table 6). The low dehydrogenation rates 
on Ga203 catalyst suggest that propane activa- 
tion does not occur solely on monofunctional 
Ga sites at typical propane dehydrocyclodimer- 
ization conditions. 
Clearly, the function of Ga sites cannot be 
limited to the initial dehydrogenation of propane 
because the rate of propene conversion to aro- 
matics also increases when Ga is introduced 
into H-ZSM5. Moreover, Ga sites do not in- 
crease the rate of C-H bond activation in 
propane and participate predominantly in hydro- 
gen desorption elementary steps required for 
dehydrogenation reactions. It is possible that Ga 
sites in Ga20 3 catalyze only the recombination 
of hydrogen atoms formed in this case by ther- 
mal activation of C-H bonds in propane at high 
temperatures (> 773 K). These thermal reac- 
tions are much slower than C-H bond activa- 
tion reactions on Brnsted acid sites in H-ZSM5. 
Iglesia et al. [22,26,28,29,42], Inui et al. 
[43,50], and Le Van Mao et al. [19,21,41] have 
provided supporting evidence for the earlier 
suggestion by Mole et al. [37] that extra-frame- 
work reducible cations catalyze the recombina- 
tive desorption of H-atoms as H 2. Specifically, 
the rate of cross-exchange during dehydrocy- 
clodimerization of C3HJC3D s mixtures on 
H-ZSM5, Ga/H-ZSM5, and Zn/H-ZSM5 al- 
lows the concurrent measurement of chemical 
conversion and C-H bond activation rates 
[28,42]. The data in Table 3 show that C-H 
activation turnover rates are much greater than 
chemical conversion rates on all catalysts. 
Therefore, propane conversion to aromatics is 
not limited by the C-H activation elementary 
steps in sequential irreversible dehydrogenation 
steps required for aromatics formation. More- 
over, propane chemical conversion rates in- 
crease when Ga or Zn are present, but the C-H 
activation rate is not affected as strongly by 
these cations. Ga and Zn introduce sites that 
increase the rate of other elementary steps in 
dehydrogenation reactions; these steps are asso- 
ciated with the disposal of H-atoms formed in 
C-H activation steps. 
The requirement for acid sites in order to 
activate C-H bonds is evident from these stud- 
ies of the reactions of C3H8/C3D 8 mixtures. 
No cross exchange of deuterium atoms into 
C3H 8 or hydrogen atoms into C3D s was found 
on Na-ZSM5, because without protonic sites, it 
cannot activate C-H bonds in propane (Fig. 
11). The requirement for Brnsted acid sites in 
C-H bond activation is consistent with studies 
by Ono and co-workers [38] on weakly acidic 
borosilicates with ZSM5 structure [71-73]. Zn- 
exchanged borosilicates did not catalyze propane 
dehydrocyclodimerization, but these samples 
were able to convert propene to aromatics at 
significant rates. Weak acid sites within borosil- 
icate channels catalyze C-H 
activation in 
propene, but cannot activate C-H bonds in 
propane, a step required for the Zn-catalyzed 
removal of H-atoms and for the completion of a 
propane dehydrogenation turnover. Thus, Zn 
species, by themselves, cannot catalyze the re- 
quired initial dehydrogenation of propane with- 
out the additional presence of strong Brnsted 
acid sites involved in the initial activation of 
C-H bonds in propane. 
3.12. Hydrogenation and hydrogen transfer 
properties of modified pentasil zeolites 
Propane dehydrocyclodimerization rates and 
selectivities are independent of dihydrogen pres- 
sure (0-25 kPa) on H-ZSM5 (Figs. 22 and 23). 
The isotopic content in reaction products of 
C3Hs/D 2 mixtures also shows neither dissocia- 
tive adsorption or recombinative desorption oc- 
cur readily on H-ZSM5. Hydrogen desorption 
steps are irreversible over H-ZSM5 and the 
surface is covered with protium (96-98%) from

C-H bond activation steps rather than deu- 
terium atoms from the contacting gas phase. 
On Ga/H-ZSM5, both turnover rates and 
aromatics selectivity depend on H 2 pressure; 
they decrease as H 2 pressure increases (0-25 
kPa) because hydrogen adsorption/desorption 
sites allow gas phase hydrogen pressures to 
influence surface hydrogen concentrations and 
surface hydrogenation-dehydrogenation reac- 
tions (Figs. 22 and 23). The presence of Ga 
species allows gas phase hydrogen to dissocia- 
tively adsorb and to effectively compete for 
surface sites, thus decreasing aromatic selectiv- 
ity. Similar results were reported by Mole on 
Zn/H-ZSM5 [37]. 
Ga species act as 'portholes' for the desorp- 
tion of H-atoms, but also increase the reverse 
reaction, the dissociative chemisorption of dihy- 
drogen, as shown by the introduction of D-atoms 
in the products of propane/deuterium mixtures. 
The addition of H 2 to C3H8/He mixtures causes 
the Ga/H-ZSM5 to resemble H-ZSM5 catalyti- 
cally because the H-ZSM5 already has an 'au- 
togenous' high hydrogen concentration caused 
by the bottleneck hydrogen desorption step. 
Higher H 2 pressures lower aromatic selectivity 
and cause Ga/H-ZSM5 to form a product dis- 
tribution more closely resembling the undesired 
H-ZSM5 product distribution. 
The introduction of Ga and Zn cations into 
H-ZSM5 channels may introduce momentary 
hydrogen acceptors that allow the recombinative 
desorption of H-atoms as H 2. Permanent stoi- 
chiometric hydrogen acceptors also remove H- 
atoms formed on H-ZSM5 during propane de- 
hydrocyclodimerization [28]. Iglesia and Baum- 
garter [28] have shown that the kinetic coupling 
of the C-H bond activation steps during propane 
dehydrocyclodimerization with hydrogen trans- 
fer of H-atoms to stoichiometric hydrogen ac- 
ceptors (13CO, 13CO2, and O e) also increases 
aromatic turnover rates and selectivities to un- 
saturated products (Fig. 24). 
13CO acts as a stoichiometric scavenger and 
increases aromatics selectivity during propane 
conversion on H-ZSM5, but only small amounts 
of 13C (< 1%) appear in reaction products. In- 
stead of the desired conversion of 13CO and

The presence of small amounts of 02 in 
C3H8/He increases aromatics selectivity on H- 
ZSM5 (Fig. 24). 02 is not, however, a selective 
hydrogen scavenger and also reacts with propane 
to form CO 2. At higher conversions, oxygen is 
depleted and propane reacts via purely non- 
oxidative pathways and the selectivity to aro- 
matics begins to resemble that obtained using 
pure propane [28]. 
The addition of 13CO2 also increases the 
aromatics selectivity on H-ZSM5 (Fig. 24). 
However, reaction products of 13CO2/C3H8 
mixtures on H-ZSM5 contain minimal amounts 
(< 1%) of 3C. The effect of CO 2 addition is 
minimal because the hydrogenation of CO 2 is 
not thermodynamically favored at these reaction 
temperatures (773 K). 
The introduction of alternate H-disposal path- 
ways, whether by using stoichiometric acceptors 
(CO, CO 2, or 0 2) or metal cations (Ga or Zn), 
removes the burden of hydrogen removal from 
other steps that form light alkanes and reduce 
aromatics selectivity. These alternate pathways 
dispose of H-atoms during propane dehydrocy- 
clodimerization on H-ZSM5 and prevent hydro- 
genation and cracking reactions that provide an 
alternate disposal route for H-atoms. 
4. Conclusions 
Reactions of propane on H-ZSM5 require the 
activation of C-H bonds and the disposal of the 
hydrogen atoms produced in these reactions. 
Hydrogen disposal can take place by transfer to 
adsorbed hydrocarbon fragments on the surface 
or by the recombinative desorption to form 
dihydrogen (H 2). The sequential release of sev- 
eral H-atoms during a propane aromatization 
turnover limits the rate and selectivity of this 
reaction on H-ZSM5. 
Isotopic exchange experiments suggest that 
propane aromatization occurs on H-ZSM5 by a 
complex reaction sequence involving dehydro- 
genation to propene, rapid oligomerization- 
cracking of alkene intermediates, and the cy- 
clization and aromatization of these alkenes into 
stable C 6 + aromatics. These reactions proceed 
in parallel with acid-catalyzed and thermal 
cracking reactions to form methane and ethane. 
Hydrogen is also formed as a result of the 
recombinative desorption of hydrogen adsorbed 
on the zeolite surface. 
Modifications of such pentasil zeolites with 
exchanged Ga and Zn cations increase the rate 
of hydrogen disposal, the propane turnover rate, 
and aromatic selectivity. Isotopic studies show 
that C-H bond activation appears to occur at 
similar rates on H-ZSM5, Ga/H-ZSM5, and 
Zn/H-ZSM5, but that exchanged Ga and Zn 
cations increase the rates of chemical propane 
conversion, of recombinative hydrogen desorp- 
tion, and of incorporation of D-atoms from D 2 
into reaction products. 
The initial rate of propene formation is much 
higher on Ga/H-ZSM5 and Zn/H-ZSM5 com- 
pared to H-ZSM5, but isotopic evidence from 
C3Hs/C3D 8 mixtures show that C-H bond 
activation rate depends weakly on the presence 
of Ga and Zn. Reactions over Na-ZSM5 con- 
firm that C-H bond activation occurs predomi- 
nantly on BrOnsted acid sites. Ga and Zn sites 
increase the rate of propene formation by re- 
moving H-atoms from acid sites that activate 
C-H bonds, allowing acid sites to turnover 
without the formation of cracking products. Ga 
and Zn act as 'portholes' and catalyze the re- 
combinative desorption of H-atoms, formed 
from acid-catalyzed C-H bond cleavage, as all- 
hydrogen (He). This removal of H-atoms by the 
recombinative desorption is highly desired in 
order to minimize unwanted by-products such 
as methane and ethane and to extract valuable 
H 2 with a high selectivity from light alkanes.
