This work demonstrates that Ga-modified HZSM-5 nanosheets exhibited the significantly improved catalytic performance with n-pentane conversion and BTEX
selectivity of over 40% and 45%, respectively. From the structural analysis of the roles of Ga active species in the C5 aromatization, it is also important to mention
that the enhanced catalytic activity related to an increase of the contribution degree of highly dispersed tetrahedral Ga species compared to bulk Ga2O3, which was
confirmed by both experimental and theoretical points of view.

The aromatization of C5 hydrocarbons is an interesting process to convert low-cost petrochemical-based com-
pounds to high value-added compounds, especially benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, and xylene (BTEX).
However, the development of an appropriate catalyst for this reaction is still challenging both academic and
industrial points of view. In this context, the Ga-incorporated zeolites with hierarchical nanosheet structures
have been successfully prepared by various preparation methods, including an in-situ approach, an ion-exchange,
and impregnation methods. Compared to the conventional catalyst, Ga-modified HZSM-5 nanosheets exhibited
the significantly improved catalytic performance with n-pentane conversion and BTEX selectivity of over 40%
and 45%, respectively. From the structural analysis of the roles of Ga active species in the C5 aromatization, it is
also important to mention that the enhanced catalytic activity related to an increase in the contribution degree of
highly dispersed tetrahedral Ga species attached to the zeolite framework compared to bulk Ga2O3 particles in
nanosheet structures, which was confirmed by both experimental and theoretical (DFT calculation) data. This

work opens up new perspectives for the ZSM-5 nanosheet catalyst design in the application of the C5 ar-
omatization.
1. Introduction
The transformation of light alkanes to high value-added aromatic
hydrocarbons, in particular, benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, and xy-
lene (BTEX), is of crucial importance in the petrochemical industry.
Currently, there have been some reports on industrially available pro-
cesses for alkane aromatization, such as Cyclar (BP-UOP) and M2-
forming (Mobil) [1]. The conventional HZSM-5 zeolite has been applied
in this process because of its unique properties of ZSM-5 structure, in
particular, the molecular shape selectivity towards BTEX products.
Moreover, to increase the activity and aromatics selectivity, the dehy-
drogenation promoters, such as gallium, platinum, and zinc, have been
introduced [2a,2b]. The most popular one is based on the gallium in-
corporated HZSM-5 (Ga-HZSM-5) as the effective bifunctional catalyst
for converting light alkanes to aromatic compounds because Ga species
have not only modified the acidity of zeolite, but also played an im-
portant role in the dehydrogenation of paraffins [3a,3b]. Several pro-
moters supported on HZSM-5 catalysts have been successfully used in
the light naphtha aromatization [4a,4b]. For example, the influence of
various promoters, such as ZnO, Ga2O3, Fe2O3, and Cr2O3, impregnated
over a conventional HZSM-5 zeolite on n-hexane aromatization, was
investigated [5a]. The high activity towards BTEX formation was ob-
served in cases of Ga2O3/H-ZSM-5 and ZnO/H-ZSM-5. The aromatic
selectivity over ZnO and Ga2O3 was comparable with each other
(40%); however, the amount of coke deposits on ZnO/H-ZSM-5 was
significantly higher than that of the Ga2O3/H-ZSM-5 catalyst. In addi-
tion, the effect of reducible zinc and gallium species obtained during
the pretreatment with hydrogen on catalytic performances of the light
alkane aromatization has been studied [2,5b,7,8]. The conventional Zn-
exchanged HZSM-5 consists of different forms of zinc species obtained
with and without H2 treatment [2]. For example, the H2 pretreatment
can promote the formation of active zinc species, ZnH+, resulting in
increasing the BTEX and light olefins selectivities to 31 and 52%, re-
spectively [2].
In previous reports, the effect of nature of gallium species supported
on zeolites on the catalytic activity has been widely studied [6,7]. Ty-
pically, gallium species can be presented in many different forms, such
as gallium oxide aggregation, reducible gallium cation species, and
gallium small nanoparticles depending on the pretreatment condition
[8]. The reducible gallium, GaH2
+, has been proposed as one of the
most important active dehydrogenation sites obtained in the presence
of hydrogen or ethane/propane [7,9a,9b] and can promote the dehy-
drogenation of ethane [9a].
In addition, the preparation method also affects the formation of
different gallium species supported on zeolites. Typically, gallium
species on zeolites were mainly obtained by one of the following three
methods: (i) hydrothermal in-situ synthesis [10] (ii) impregnation with
gallium ion source [11]; (iii) ion-exchange method [9b]. Recently, it
has been reported that aromatics obtained from the aromatization of
propane can be achieved over HZSM-5 prepared by a hydrothermal in-
situ method [1214]. However, there are some limitations for the in-
creasing of Ga content, depending on kinetics and zeolite structure type
[15]. Therefore, the impregnation is a versatile method applied with
various types and contents of metals. Unfortunately, obtained gallium
species are preferable in the form of aggregated gallium oxides located
on external zeolite surfaces, resulting in poor activities [5].
An alternative way to prepare active gallium species is based on
using an ion-exchange method. This is a promising strategy because it
not only provides highly dispersed species, but also easily tunes the ion-
exchange degree by adjusting several factors, for example, the Si/Al
ratio of catalysts [13,16]. Unfortunately, it sometimes suffers from
disadvantages because the limitation of sole microporous networks of
zeolite results in the low diffusion rate of hydrated metal cations in a
microporous structure [17]. In addition, the catalytic lifetime is too
short, and therefore the activity dramatically decreases due to the coke
formation inside a conventional zeolite structure.
In order to circumvent this problem, gallium-modified zeolites with
hierarchically porous structures have been extensively developed.
Recently, Choi and colleagues pointed out the effect of mesoporosity
and internal silanols as defect sites on the deactivation of Ga-im-
pregnated alkaline-treated HZSM-5 during the n-pentane aromatization
reaction [18]. The modified mesopores and internal silanol groups over
zeolite catalysts have been successfully prepared by using desilication
and subsequent treatment with ammonium hexafluorosilicate (AHSF).
It was found that the high mesoporosity and low defect sites are very
effective in decreasing the coke formation.
To further improve the aromatization catalyst performance, other
promoters, such as Pt and Zn [19] were added into the zeolite frame-
work of gallium-modified mesoporous structures. Akhtar and collea-
gues [20] reported that the Pt-promoted intracrystalline mesoporous
gallosilicate ZSM-11 obtained by a post-treatment can be used as a
highly efficient catalyst for the n-hexane aromatization. As expected,
the catalysts show higher activity (70% of conversion) and BTX se-
lectivity (37.6%) than those of the metals-modified conventional ZSM-
11.
Apart from using hierarchical zeolites obtained by dealumination
and desilication methods or post-treatment approaches, many re-
searchers have successfully synthesized hierarchical zeolites by a direct
synthesis, in particular, using a soft template to control nanosheet
structures [2126]. Recently, the hierarchical galloaluminosilicate
zeolites with MFI structure have been successfully fabricated using
tetrabutylphosphonium hydroxide (TBPOH) as a dual-structure di-
recting agent [14]. In this case, TBPOH was used to simultaneously
produce the MFI structure and the self-assemblies of nanolayers. To the
best of our knowledge, the effect of nanosheet structures promoting
gallium species obtained by different preparation methods on the n-
pentane reforming to aromatics has not yet been understood at the
moment.
In the present work, we extend the scope of the application of
hierarchical galloaluminosilicate zeolites having the nanosheet-as-
sembled morphologies for the production of aromatics from n-pentane
reforming via aromatization. In addition, the relationship between the
structural properties of catalysts prepared by different methods (hy-
drothermal in-situ synthesis, impregnation with gallium ion source, ion-
exchange method) and catalytic performances are discussed by both
experimental and theoretical points of view.
2. Experimental section
2.1. Synthesis of zeolite catalysts
Hierarchical Ga-ZSM-5 nanosheets obtained by three methods: an
in-situ method, ion-exchange and wet impregnation, have been pre-
pared following a modified literature procedure [14,22,25]. As for the
in-situ method, the molar composition of 60SiO2/xAl2O3/0.60 Ga2O3/
18TBPOH/0.75NaOH/240EtOH/600H2O, where x was 0.40 and 0.60,
was used. In a typical procedure, the first solution consisting of alu-
minium
isoproproxide
(Sigma-Aldrich,
98.0%),
gallium
nitrate
(Sigma-Aldrich, 99.9%), and tetraethyl orthosilicate (Sigma-Aldrich,
99.0%) was mixed in a plastic beaker. The mixture of tetra-
butylphosphonium hydroxide (TBPOH, Sigma-Aldrich, 40% in H2O) as
a bifunctional template and sodium hydroxide solution in DI water was

then added into the first solution under vigorous stirring at room
temperature for 12 h. Afterwards, the clear solution was transferred
into a Teflon lined stainless steel autoclave and heated at 403 K for 48 h.
After crystallization, the sample was centrifuged and washed with DI
water followed by drying at 373 K for overnight. The obtained sample
was calcined at 823 K for 10 h to remove the template. The calcined
zeolite was ion-exchanged with 1.0 M NH4NO3 solutions for three
times, and then calcined at 823 K for 6 h to obtain the catalyst in a
proton form. For the hierarchical Ga-ZSM-5 nanosheets prepared by an
ion-exchange method, Ga species were loaded on the NH4
+-ZSM-5
nanosheets, which were prepared by the above-mentioned procedure
except adding the Ga source during the hydrothermal synthesis. To
keep the same Ga loading content (1 wt% of Ga), the Ga cations were
loaded on the synthesized zeolites by an ion-exchange with gallium
nitrate (Ga(NO3)3) solution under different conditions. For example, the
Ga supported hierarchical zeolite with the Si/Al ratio of 38 was pre-
pared by an ion exchange with 20 mL of 0.05 M gallium nitrate (Ga
(NO3)3) solution at 353 K for 1 h, whereas the Ga supported hier-
archical zeolite with the Si/Al ratio of 69 was prepared using a 0.025 M
gallium nitrate (Ga(NO3)3) solution at the same temperature for 1 h.
The Ga-exchanged zeolites were then washed with DI water and dried
at 373 K for 24 h. Afterwards, the obtained Ga-exchanged zeolites were
calcined at 823 K for 6 h. For the Ga impregnated zeolite nanosheets, a
1 g of the proton-ZSM-5 zeolite nanosheet was contacted with a 10 mL
of a 1.5 × 104 M solution of the gallium nitrate (Ga(NO3)3) in deio-
nized water. The sample was stirred at room temperature for 24 h. The
solution was carefully evaporated using a rotary evaporator, and the
sample was then dried at 353 K and further calcined at 823 K for 6 h.
The obtained Ga-modified zeolite nanosheets are denoted as GaInsZS-5-
NS-X, GaExcZS-5-NS-X, and GaImpZS-5-NS-X for samples obtained by
in-situ method, ion-exchange method, and impregnation method, re-
spectively, and X represents the actual Si/Al ratio obtained by X-ray
fluorescence (XRF) experiments.
The Ga-modified conventional zeolites were obtained following by a
modified literature procedure [15,27]. In a typical procedure, sodium
aluminate (Sigma-Aldrich, technical anhydrous) and tetraethyl ortho-
silicate (Sigma-Aldrich, 99.0%) were dissolved in a sodium hydroxide
solution.
Afterwards,
tetrapropylammonium
hydroxide,
TPOAH
(Sigma-Aldrich, 1.0 M in water) was added into a silica-alumina gel
under vigorous stirring at room temperature. The zeolitic gel with the
molar composition of 12SiO2/xAl2O3/1TPAOH/1.03NaOH/240EtOH/
400H2O, where x was 0.08 and 0.12, was then transferred into a Teflon
lined stainless steel autoclave and heated at 453 K for 72 h. Finally, the
white product was washed and dried at 373 K for overnight. The re-
moval of organic template was done by the calcination at 823 K for
10 h. As for the Ga-modified conventional zeolites prepared by in-situ
method, they have been synthesized by the above-mentioned procedure
with adding the gallium nitrate solution during the hydrothermal pro-
cess. An aqueous gel has a molar composition of 12SiO2/xAl2O3/
0.08Ga2O3/1TPAOH/1.03NaOH/240EtOH/400H2O, where x was 0.06
and 0.08. The Ga exchanged conventional zeolites were prepared by an
ion-exchange method. A 10 mL of 1.0 M gallium nitrate (Ga(NO3)3) at
353 K for 24 h solution was used in the case of the Ga incorporated
conventional zeolite with the Si/Al ratio of 71, whereas the 1.5 M (Ga
(NO3)3) solution was used for the sample with the Si/Al ratio of 36 at
the same temperature for 24 h. For the Ga impregnated conventional
zeolites
prepared
by
the
impregnation
process,
the
10 mL
of
1.5 × 104 M (Ga(NO3)3) solution was added onto a 1 g of the con-
ventional HZSM-5 under stirring and heating at 353 K for 12 h. Finally,
the Ga-modified zeolites were then washed with DI water and dried at
373 K for 24 h. Afterwards, the obtained Ga-modified zeolites were
calcined at 823 K for 6 h. They are denoted as GaInsZS-5-CON-X,
GaExcZS-5-CON-X, and GaImpZS-5-CON-X for the conventional sam-
ples obtained by in-situ method, ion-exchange method, and impregna-
tion method, respectively, and X represents the actual Si/Al ratio ob-
tained by X-ray fluorescence (XRF) experiments. All cases consist of the
Ga content close to 1 wt%.
2.2. Characterization
Powder X-Ray diffraction (XRD): XRD patterns were recorded (a
Bruker D8 ADVANCE instrument using CuKα radiation (30 kV, 40 mA))
and operated with the step size of 0.02 and the scan rate of 1 min1 in
the 2θ range of 550.
The temperature-programmed desorption of NH3 (NH3-TPD):
NH3-TPD experiments were performed on the Belcat II chemisorption
analyzer equipped with thermal conductivity detectors (TCD). In NH3-
TPD experiments, the sample was pretreated in He flow (50 mL.min1)
at 773 K for 1 h. Subsequently, it was cooled down to 373 K. The 5 v/v.
% of NH3 in He was then introduced for 30 min and it was then purged
under the flow of He (50 mL.min1) for 15 min. To record NH3-TPD
profiles, the temperature was increased from 323 K to 973 K with the
heating rate of 10 K.min1.
71Ga NMR spectroscopy: Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR)
spectra of the Ga-modified zeolites were measured with the 11.7 T
Bruker DMX500 NMR spectrometer operating at 152 MHz. A standard
Bruker MAS probehead was used with a rotor with a diameter of
2.5 mm, operated at a spinning rate of 25 kHz. The 71Ga chemical shifts
were referenced to saturated solutions of Ga(NO3)3.
The EXAFS measurement: The Ga K edge EXAFS spectra were
collected in a fluorescence XAS mode using a Ge(220) double crystal
monochromator at the SUT-NANOTEC-SLRI XAS beamline (BL5.2),
SLRI, Nakhonratchasima, Thailand [28,29]. The EXAFS data analysis
was carefully performed using Athena and Artemis programs in the
IFEFFIT package [30,31].
The temperature-programmed reduction of H2 (H2-TPR): H2-
TPR experiments were performed on the Belcat II chemisorption ana-
lyzer equipped with thermal conductivity detectors (TCD). In H2-TPR
experiments, the sample was pretreated in Ar (50 mL.min1) at 573 K
for 1 h and then the temperature was ramped from 323 K to 973 K at
5 K.min1 under the flow of 2 v/v.% of H2/Ar (50 mL.min1). To re-
cord H2-TPR profiles, the temperature was increased from 323 K to
973 K with the heating rate of 10 K.min1.
The temperature-programmed oxidation of O2 (O2-TPO): O2-
TPO studies were performed on the Belcat II chemisorption analyzer
with thermal conductivity detectors (TCD). In O2-TPO experiments, the
sample was pretreated in He flow (50 mL.min1) at 473 K for 2 h. and
the temperature was then increased from 323 K to 973 K at 5 K.min1
under the flow of 5 v/v.% of O2/He (50 mL.min1). The TPO profiles
were recorded in the temperature range of 373 K to 1073 K with the
ramp rate of 5 K.min1.
2.3. n-Pentane aromatization
The conversion of n-pentane to aromatics was carried out in a
continuous down-flow fixed-bed reactor. A 0.2 g of catalyst was placed
into the reactor. Prior to the catalytic studies, zeolite samples were
activated
at
773 K
in
the
flow
of
N2
(38 mL.min1)
and
H2
(2 mL.min1) for 3 h. The feed of n-pentane in 25 mL.min1 of N2 was
introduced into the reactor. All reactions were carried out at 773 K,
WHSV (weight hourly space velocity) of 2.5 h1 [32], and atmospheric
pressure. The analysis of the reaction mixtures was performed by an on-
line gas chromatograph (GC) (Agilent 7820A) equipped with a FID
detector and a GS-GASPRO capillary column (60 m × 0.320 mm) at an
interval time of 1 h. The mass balance was checked for all experiments
(98.29  1.70%). The percentage of mass of an identified hydrocarbon
compound (M) [33] was calculated using the Eq. (1):

3. Results and discussion
3.1. Characterization of catalysts
According to previous reports, hierarchical galloaluminosilicate
zeolites with the MFI structure have been successfully synthesized using
a one-pot hydrothermal synthesis in the presence of TBPOH as a dual
template [14]. In the present study, galloaluminosilicate zeolites have
been synthesized by three different methods: (i) an in-situ method
(GaInsZS-5-NS); (ii) an ion-exchange with gallium cation (GaExcZS-5-
NS); (iii) an impregnation method (GaImpZS-5-NS). XRD results ex-
hibited well-resolved diffraction peaks, confirming the characteristic of
the MFI framework and were similar to what has been demonstrated in
our previous report [14] as shown in Fig. 1A. In addition, the char-
acteristic peaks of β-Ga2O3 after calcination were not observed, im-
plying that gallium species were well dispersed with a very small
crystallite size or the relatively low content of gallium species. The
different morphologies of conventional Ga-modified zeolites and syn-
thesized nanosheets have been demonstrated in our previous report. All
samples composed of well crystalline structures and a uniform particle
size distribution (Fig. 1B). Compared to conventional zeolite structures
having a particle size in the range of 3.824.36 m, the obviously
smaller particle size was observed in the case of hierarchical nanosheet
structures (154.17170.32 nm), as shown in Fig. 1C. This behavior
eventually leads to a very significant increase of an external surface
area of hierarchical galloaluminosilicate zeolite compared to the con-
ventional one [14].
The acid properties of catalysts were investigated by FTIR of pyr-
idine adsorption. The IR data of both catalysts exhibited two obvious
bands of the stretching mode at 1548 and 1453 cm1, assigned to
pyridine adsorbed on Brnsted acid (PyH) and Lewis acid (PyL) sites of
zeolites, respectively, as shown in Fig. S1. The quantitative analysis of
acid sites was also determined in IR studies of the pyridine adsorption.
The concentration of Brnsted acid sites (BAS) and Lewis acid sites
(LAS) was calculated by the integration of PyH and PyL peak areas, as
summarized in Table S1. Compared to the HZS-5-CON-72, the zeolite
nanosheets exhibited the comparable density of total acid sites, whereas
the lower concentration of the strong Brnsted acid sites was observed.
This behavior related to the lower characteristic of microporous net-
work due to the presence of the stacked layered structures of

The characteristics of zeolite samples, including the Si/Al ratio, the
Ga content, and the number of acid sites are summarized in Table 1.
The Ga content of all catalysts was close to 1.0 wt%. To compare acid
properties of hierarchical galloaluminosilicate zeolites prepared by
different methods as shown in Table 1 and Fig. 2 for NH3-TPD profiles
(Fig. 2A) and their deconvoluted curves (Fig. 2B), with the Gaussian
deconvolution, it was found that three major peaks were assigned to (i)
weak acid sites (463493 K); (ii) medium acid sites (550593 K); (iii)
strong acid sites (673703 K). Obviously, a number of strong acid sites
of hierarchical galloaluminosilicate zeolites were lower significantly
than those of the conventional one with the similar Si/Al ratio, whereas
the medium and weak acid site content was significantly increased,
implying that the hierarchical sample provided a higher amount of
weak silanol surfaces. As expected, the number of all types of acid sites
strongly related to the Si/Al ratio, and therefore the higher acid density
was observed when decreasing the Si/Al ratio.
Textural properties of the parent zeolites, conventional galloalu-
minosilicate
MFI
(GaExcZS-5-CON-36)
and
hierarchical
samples
(GaExcZS-5-NS) were investigated by N2 physisorption techniques as
shown in Fig. 3, Fig. S2, and Table 2. The isotherms of hierarchical
samples composed of the combination of type-I and IV characteristics
[34] (Fig. 3A and B), confirming the presence of hierarchical structures
of microporous and mesoporous features. In strong contrast to this, the
GaExcZS-5-CON-36 exhibited the type-I isotherm due to the char-
acteristic of microporous structure. Obviously, hierarchical samples
showed significantly higher external surface areas than that of the
conventional zeolite. In addition, the BJH pore size distribution re-
vealed that hierarchical samples contained additional larger pores in
the size range of 3040 nm, whereas this characteristic disappeared in
the case of GaExcZS-5-CON-36 (Fig. 3C and D).
To verify the nature of Ga species obtained on different supports,
the powerful 71Ga NMR technique was used to characterize the Ga
zeolite samples obtained by an ion-exchange method as shown in

The resonance at the chemical shift of 6 to 24 ppm [35,36] is assigned
to the octahedral Ga3+ or Ga2O3, at the external surface of zeolite and
the peak at ca. 150 ppm is attributed to the tetrahedral Ga3+ of Ga
(OH)2
+ or Ga(H)2
+ attached to the Brnsted acid site of zeolite fra-
meworks [37]. Obviously, in the case of GaExcZS-5-CON-36, it con-
tained only the signal at 3 to 4 ppm, implying the main species of Ga
is a non-framework or octahedrally coordinated Ga2O3. Interestingly,

predominant peaks at around 150 and 24 ppm, assigning to the pre-
sence of both tetrahedral and octahedral Ga species. The high con-
centration of tetrahedral Ga species of GaExcZS-5-NS-38 was 43%.
These observations confirmed that the hierarchical structure played an
important role in improving the migration and dispersion of Ga species
to form the tetrahedral Ga species.
To further verify the effect of hierarchical structure and preparation
method on the nature of Ga species, the EXAFS results revealed the
presence of different forms of gallium species on conventional and
hierarchical samples obtained by different preparation methods as
shown in Table 3. Generally, the tetrahedral GaeO had a bond distance
in the first coordination shell of 1.83 Å, while the octahedral GaeO had
2.00 Å of the bond distance [38]. A slight increase in the GaeO bond

with average distances of 1.94 Å in the case of the conventional zeolite
suggested the presence of a higher fraction of the octahedral environ-
ment. Compared to the conventional one, the nature of Ga species
supported on hierarchical nanosheets was significantly changed con-
firmed by reducing the GaeO distance with the average distance of
1.821.83 Å. In addition, the mean-coordination number of Ga atoms of
hierarchical nanosheets was reduced from 5.9 to 3.4 compared to the
conventional one. These observations indicated that the hierarchical
structure could greatly improve the dispersion of Ga species, which
preferably presented in the form of highly dispersed tetrahedral gallium
species. These results were also consistent with 71Ga NMR data, which
confirmed that the GaExcZS-5-NS represented the contribution of tet-
rahedral Ga environment, whereas the Ga species were aggregated to
form the bulk Ga2O3 in the case of the conventional sample. In addition,
the catalytic behavior of tetrahedral framework gallium species could
be expected to be responsible for the dehydrogenation reaction on the
transformation of light paraffin into aromatics [39].
Furthermore, it was found that the GaInsZS-5-NS and GaImpZS-5-
NS exhibited the similar value of bond distances (1.828 and 1.829 Å,
respectively); and therefore, it implied that both catalysts possibly
composed of the same contribution of Ga species. However, the
GaExcZS-5-NS contributed a slightly low value of GaeO bond distance
and the mean coordination number of Ga atoms with respect to other
catalysts, it is therefore reasonable to assume that this catalyst ex-
hibited a decrease of the contribution degree of octahedrally bulk
Ga2O3 species in the hierarchical zeolite framework.
The different nature of Ga species was also confirmed by the H2-TPR
technique as shown in Fig. S3. Each reduction peak represents the
different form of specific Ga species. The GaInsZS-5-NS and GaImpZS-5-
NS exhibited obvious peaks at a higher temperature than 900 K, sug-
gesting the octahedral environment of bulk Ga2O3 particles [9b]. In
strong contrast to this, two major reduction peaks were observed at a
significantly lower temperature than 900 K over the Ga-modified zeolite
nanosheets prepared by an ion-exchange method (GaExcZS-5-NS) cor-
responding to the well-dispersed Ga species and/or small Ga [40]. All
results from EXAFS, 71Ga NMR, and H2-TPR exclusively confirmed the
high contribution degree of dispersed Ga species in tetrahedral en-
vironments of the hierarchical samples obtained by an ion-exchange
method.
3.2. Catalytic performances of catalysts
3.2.1. Effect of hydrogen pretreatment
Gallium incorporated HZSM-5 zeolites have played an important
role as bi-functional catalysts. Ga species can promote the dehy-
drogenation of paraffins [41], while Brnsted acid sites facilitate oli-
gomerization and aromatization [42,43]. Prior to the catalytic test,
catalysts were pretreated by the stream of He or H2 in order to compare
the catalytic performance. In the case of the pretreatment under the
inert atmosphere without H2 flow, it is well-known that the bulk Ga2O3
was formed, and they exhibited a low catalytic activity [5]. In contrast,
several reducible Ga species under the stream of H2, in particular, di-
hydrido gallium complex (GaH2
+) might be presented as active species
for the dehydrogenation reaction [5,9]. To confirm this hypothesis, the
catalytic activity of pentane aromatization over reduced Ga species
obtained after hydrogen pretreatment compared to that of non-reduced
Ga catalysts was elucidated as shown in Fig. 4. As expected, the con-
version of n-pentane as a model compound of light naphtha can be
greatly increased after the hydrogen pretreatment (40% of pentane
conversion level). Meanwhile, the Ga-incorporated zeolite was treated
under He atmosphere (without H2), which may promote the formation
of bulk Ga2O3 particles [6,44], then a low conversion of n-pentane was
obtained (12%) (Fig. 4A). Moreover, the Ga-modified zeolite obtained
after the pretreatment with hydrogen significantly improved the aro-
matic selectivity. The selectivity of BTEX was increased about 2.5 times
compared to the pretreated catalyst with He. It is reasonable to assume
that under the hydrogen pretreatment, reducible active Ga species
might be formed as active dehydrogenation sites, facilitating the for-
mation of light olefins as intermediate compounds, which can be easily
oligomerized and finally produced aromatic compounds [45]. These
observations make it clear that the H2 pretreatment is one of the most
important factors for improving the aromatization yield from the ar-
omatization of alkane.
3.2.2. Effect of hierarchical structures and preparation methods
To illustrate the benefit of hierarchical structures, we also in-
vestigated the catalytic performance of hierarchical zeolites compared
to the conventional one with the similar Si/Al ratio and Ga content
obtained by the same preparation method. As expected, the low cata-
lytic performances in terms of the activity and BTEX selectivity were
observed in the absence of gallium species (Fig. S4). Interestingly,
hierarchical zeolite nanosheet catalysts exhibited exceptional catalytic
activity and high aromatic selectivity (62% and 41% for pentane con-
version level and product selectivity, respectively), whereas the con-
ventional zeolite showed a significantly lower aromatic selectivity (8%)
(Fig. 5). Not only an improved aromatic selectivity but also the lower
portion of cracked products was observed in the case of the nanosheet
catalyst. The reason for this decrease in cracked products related to the
fact that the number of strong acid sites of the conventional catalyst
(GaExcZS-5-CON-71) was significantly lower than that of the GaExcZS-
5-NS-69 (Table 1). Indeed, the strong Brnsted acidity was the main
factor to promote the catalytic cracking of alkanes [46]. Therefore, Ga-
incorporated zeolite with hierarchical nanosheet structures not only
improved the accessibility of bulky molecules to active sites [47] but
also altered acid properties of zeolite framework, providing benefits to
reduce undesired cracked products (e.g., methane, ethane, propane). As
stated above, the conversion and selectivity towards aromatics could
also depend on the nature of gallium species. We also carried out a

pentane aromatization. (A) n-pentane conversion (%) as a function of time-on-
stream (TOS) and (B) product selectivity (%) obtained at 15 h of TOS on hier-

72).

series of experiments according to catalysts obtained by different pre-
paration methods. As can be seen in Fig. 6, the n-pentane conversion

In
other
words,
the
hierarchal Ga incorporated HZSM-5 prepared by an ion-exchange
method exhibited the highest yield of aromatics (41%). This makes it
clear that Ga-modified ZSM-5 nanosheets obtained by different methods
can provide the formation of different Ga active species, eventually
leading to promoting different catalytic activities. As above-mentioned
different Ga species obtained from the different preparation techniques
confirmed by EXAFS and H2-TPR, the high contribution degree of dis-
persed Ga species in tetrahedral environments of the hierarchical
samples can be obtained when preparing by an ion-exchange method.
This eventually led to increase the catalytic activity and aromatic se-
lectivity of n-pentane aromatization due to an improved Ga active
species.
3.3. Catalytic activities of Ga-modified hierarchical zeolites obtained by the
ion-exchange method
3.3.1. Effect of acid site density
As above-mentioned results, it showed that the Ga-exchanged
hierarchical zeolite nanosheets provided the exceptional catalytic ac-
tivity and aromatic selectivity. The acid site density was known to play
an important role in an increase of catalytic activity due to a large
number of acidic sites of zeolites. Thus, to increase the yield of aro-
matics, the catalytic performances of Ga-exchanged hierarchical zeolite
nanosheets with the different Si/Al ratios were investigated as shown in
Fig. 7A and B and Table S2. As expected, the GaExcZS-5-NS-38 can
greatly enhance in terms of both n-pentane conversion and aromatics
selectivity compared to the GaExcZS-5-NS-69. Considering the acidity
of GaExcZS-5-NS-38, it exhibited the higher number of total active sites
compared with those of the GaExcZS-5-NS-69, as shown in Table 1. The
reason for this increase in the catalytic activity of high acid catalyst
related to the fact that the high acid density can facilitate the catalytic
cracking of n-pentane in the first step of reaction and then also enabled
further oligomerization and cyclization [20]. Unfortunately, in the case
of the conventional structure even at the low Si/Al ratio, it is still ex-
hibiting the low conversion, the low aromatics selectivity, and the rapid
catalyst deactivation. These observations confirmed that an increase of
aromatics yield was not only depended on the Si/Al ratio but also
strongly affected by hierarchical structures of zeolites.
To investigate the coke formation on hierarchical Ga incorporated
HZSM-5, the amount and nature of deposited coke species were ob-
served by the O2 temperature-programmed oxidation (O2-TPO) as
shown in Fig. S5 and Table 4. O2-TPO profiles demonstrate the location
and the type of carbonaceous species. The oxidized amorphous carbon
type exhibited at a low temperature (< 573 K), relating coke species
located on outer zeolite surfaces. Such a high-temperature peak
(> 750 K) possessed to graphitic carbons or polynuclear aromatic cokes
which referred to pore blocking inside zeolite structures [48,49]. As for
the coke content, the higher amount of coke was, as expected, deposited
onto the GaExcZS-5-NS-38 compared to the GaExcZS-5-NS-69. This
behavior related to the fact that the high acid site density can promote
the aromatization to produce aromatic compounds, which can be fur-
ther transformed to coke species [15]. Compared to the GaExcZS-5-
CON-36, although the higher coke content was observed in the case of

the GaExcZS-5-NS-38 obtained at 24 h of TOS, it provided a lower
amount of deposited coke at an initial period (2 h of TOS). This beha-
vior suggested that nanosheet structures confirmed the resistance of
catalyst deactivation from the coke formation due to the hierarchical
structure.
From these observations, it clearly demonstrated that the optimal n-
pentane aromatization performance in terms of n-pentane conversion
and BTEX selectivity was observed over Ga-modified zeolite na-
nosheets, especially hierarchical Ga-exchanged zeolite catalysts. The
reason for this increase in the catalytic performance of n-pentane ar-
omatization over the hierarchical Ga incorporated HZSM-5 obtained by
an ion-exchange method related to the presence of the high contribu-
tion degree of highly dispersed Ga species.
As stated above that nanosheet structures can promote the high
dispersion of Ga species on zeolite catalysts, to gain insights into the
roles of various Ga active species on the catalytic performance, the
mechanism of n-pentane dehydrogenation, which was considered as the
rate determining step of alkane aromatization [46], was investigated by
means of quantum chemical calculations. There are various highly
dispersed Ga active species in zeolite framework that has been pro-
posed, including Ga+, GaO+, and Ga(H2)+ [9a,50,51]. In particular,
the Ga(H2)+ hydride species generated by H2 pretreatment or alkane
feed have been considered as one of the most active species for alkane
dehydrogenation [9a,52]. It is therefore reasonable to assume that
highly dispersed Ga(H2)+ species attached to the zeolite framework are
very important active sites in the case of gallium embedded in zeolite
nanosheets as shown in Fig. 8A(a). In contrast, the results obtained
from EXAFS and 71Ga NMR revealed that the main contribution of
gallium species on the conventional ZSM-5 corresponded to the bulk
Ga2O3 structure. To understand the role of gallium species embedded in
the conventional zeolite on the catalytic activity, the simplest gallium
oligomer species were also chosen as the catalyst model in order to
represent the gallium active sites in bulk Ga2O3 structure as shown in
Fig. 8A(b) [51,53].
The reaction mechanisms of n-pentane dehydrogenation to 1-pen-
tene over Ga-embedded zeolites were examined. The mechanism for the
GaH2
+ embedded zeolite (Fig. 8B) has been proposed by the following
three-step mechanism: (i) the activation of the CeH bond of n-pentane
to form a Brnsted acid proton at zeolite framework (I II III); (ii)
the desorption of hydrogen molecule (H1-H2Z) via a recombination of
the acidic proton and one of the hydride ions attached to gallium atom
(III IV V); (iii) the decomposition of Ga-C5H11 species to form al-
kene and gallium active sites (V VI VII VIII) that could be re-
generated in the presence of H2 or alkane feed [9a,49,54] as shown in
Fig. 8B. It was found that the rate determining step was the decom-
position of Ga-C5H11 species to form 1-pentene with the activation
energy of 63.8 kcal mol1 (Fig. 8C, black). On the other hand, the
different mechanism was obtained in case of gallium oligomer em-
bedded in the conventional ZSM-5, including the two-step mechanism
of the activation of the C-H bond of n-pentane to form a Brnsted acid
proton at zeolite framework and the decomposition of Ga-C5H11 species
to form alkene together with regenerated gallium active sites as shown
in Fig. S7. It obviously showed that the activation energy was sig-
nificantly increased approximately 13.7 kcal mol1 compared to that of
the GaH2
+ embedded zeolite model (Fig. 8C). In other words, the n-
pentane dehydrogenation over highly dispersed Ga species on na-
nosheet ZSM-5 is more favorable than that of the bulk Ga fragment
embedded in the conventional zeolite.
These observations gained the insight into that the highly dispersed
gallium species, the main contributed active sites, on nanosheet struc-
tures can promote the activity of C5 reforming. In addition, the hier-
archical porous networks can suppress the further cracking reaction to
produce undesired cracked products due to the reduction of the number
of strong acid sites. Thus, this work opens up new opportunities in the
frame of the development of novel Ga-modified zeolite nanosheet cat-
alysts for the aromatization of C5 hydrocarbons.
4. Conclusions
Hierarchical Ga incorporated zeolite nanosheets have been suc-
cessfully prepared by various preparation methods, including an in-situ
method, an ion-exchange with gallium cation, and an impregnation
method. Owing to their high surface area and hierarchical porous
networks, they provide a higher catalytic performance in terms of ac-
tivity and aromatics selectivity compared to the conventional catalyst.
In particular, Ga-modified HZSM-5 nanosheets obtained by an ion-ex-
change method exhibited the significant improvement of catalytic
performance with n-pentane conversion and BTEX selectivity of over
40% and 45%, respectively. Compared to bulk Ga2O3 characteristics in
the conventional zeolite, it is also important to mention that the im-
proved catalytic performance over Ga embedded in ZSM-5 nanosheets

related to an increase of the contribution degree of highly dispersed
tetrahedral Ga species, which is favorable to the n-pentane activation,
clearly confirmed by the observable results from both experimental and
theoretical points of view. Thus, this example opens up new opportu-
nities in the frame of the development of Ga active species embedded in
zeolite nanosheet catalysts for the aromatization of C5 hydrocarbons.
