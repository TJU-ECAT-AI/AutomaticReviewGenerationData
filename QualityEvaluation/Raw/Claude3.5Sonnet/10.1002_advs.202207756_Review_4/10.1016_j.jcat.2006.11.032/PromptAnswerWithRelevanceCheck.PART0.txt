[3] "Frash and van Santen [41] considered a similar gallium site to study the ethane dehydrogenation reaction pathway. The authors classified the reaction paths as of two types: (a) a carbenium activation pathway consisting of an alkoxide-like intermediate along the reaction path after the activation of the CH (Rδ+Hδ) bond, and (b) an alkyl activation pathway supporting the formation of GaC coordination after the activation of the CH bond (RδHδ+)."

m intermediate faces a very high activation barrier of 60 kcal/mol. Thus, we conclude that this intermediate will be a spectator species while dominating the surface intermediates."

The alkyl mechanism in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions on gallium-based catalysts involves several key steps:

1. Initial propane activation: The C-H bond in propane is activated by the gallium species, forming a Ga-C bond and releasing a proton. This step involves the polarization of the C-H bond such that the carbon develops a negative charge (δ-) and the hydrogen a positive charge (δ+).

2. Formation of Ga-alkyl intermediate: The activated propane forms a [HGaC3H7]+ intermediate species bound to the zeolite framework.

3. β-hydride elimination: A hydrogen from the β-carbon is eliminated, forming a π-complex between the resulting propene and the Ga species.

4. Product desorption: The propene desorbs from the catalyst surface, leaving behind a [GaH2]+ species.

5. Catalyst regeneration: The [GaH2]+ species releases H2 to regenerate the active Ga site.

Comparing the alkyl mechanism to the carbenium mechanism:

- Carbenium activation involves C-H bond polarization where carbon assumes a positive charge (δ+) and hydrogen a negative charge (δ-), leading to an alkoxide-like intermediate.
- Alkyl activation results in the formation of a Ga-C bond, whereas carbenium activation leads to an alkoxide species.
- The alkyl mechanism is generally more facile for the initial C-H activation step compared to the carbenium mechanism.

The C-H activation step is often proposed as the rate-determining step (RDS) because:

- It involves breaking a strong C-H bond, which typically requires significant energy.
- Subsequent steps like β-hydride elimination are usually faster.
- The activation energy for this step correlates well with overall reaction rates.

However, for Ga-based catalysts, the study suggests that while alkyl C-H activation is facile, the removal of the alkene (e.g., ethene from [HGaC2H5]+) faces a very high activation barrier. This indicates that the alkyl species may actually be a spectator rather than an active intermediate.

The alkyl mechanism applies to different Ga species structures as follows:

- The activity of the Ga sites depends on their coordination environment within the zeolite framework.
- Pair Al sites in the zeolite framework play an important role in stabilizing the Ga species and influencing their catalytic activity.
- The distance between Al pairs affects the stability and activity of the Ga sites, with an optimal distance providing a balance between activity and stability (Sabatier principle).
- Different ring structures (e.g., 4-, 5-, 6-, or 8-membered rings) in the zeolite framework influence the Ga species' stability and catalytic performance.
- The mechanism's effectiveness varies with the Ga species' reducibility, which is influenced by the zeolite structure and reaction conditions.

In summary, while the alkyl mechanism provides a pathway for PDH, the actual catalytic cycle may be more complex, with carbenium and alkyl pathways potentially competing or coexisting depending on the specific Ga species structure and reaction conditions.

镓基催化剂上丙烷脱氢(PDH)反应的烷基机理涉及几个关键步骤：

1. 初始丙烷活化：丙烷中的C-H键被镓物种活化，形成Ga-C键并释放质子。这一步骤涉及C-H键的极化，使碳形成负电荷(δ-)，氢形成正电荷(δ+)。

2. 形成Ga-烷基中间体：活化的丙烷形成与沸石骨架结合的[HGaC3H7]+中间体物种。

3. β-氢消除：β-碳上的氢被消除，在生成的丙烯和Ga物种之间形成π-络合物。

4. 产物脱附：丙烯从催化剂表面脱附，留下[GaH2]+物种。

5. 催化剂再生：[GaH2]+物种释放H2以再生活性Ga位点。

将烷基机理与碳正离子机理进行比较：

- 碳正离子活化涉及C-H键极化，其中碳呈正电荷(δ+)，氢呈负电荷(δ-)，导致类烷氧化物中间体。
- 烷基活化导致Ga-C键的形成，而碳正离子活化导致烷氧化物物种。
- 对于初始C-H活化步骤，烷基机理通常比碳正离子机理更容易进行。

C-H活化步骤常被提议为速率决定步骤(RDS)，因为：

- 它涉及打破强C-H键，通常需要大量能量。
- 后续步骤如β-氢消除通常更快。
- 这一步骤的活化能与总体反应速率有很好的相关性。

然而，对于Ga基催化剂，研究表明虽然烷基C-H活化容易进行，但烯烃的移除（例如从[HGaC2H5]+中移除乙烯）面临很高的活化能垒。这表明烷基物种可能实际上是一个旁观者而非活性中间体。

烷基机理适用于不同Ga物种结构的方式如下：

- Ga位点的活性取决于它们在沸石骨架中的配位环境。
- 沸石骨架中的铝对位点在稳定Ga物种和影响其催化活性方面起重要作用。
- 铝对之间的距离影响Ga位点的稳定性和活性，最佳距离提供活性和稳定性之间的平衡（Sabatier原理）。
- 沸石骨架中的不同环结构（如4-、5-、6-或8元环）影响Ga物种的稳定性和催化性能。
- 机理的有效性随Ga物种的可还原性而变化，这受沸石结构和反应条件的影响。

总之，虽然烷基机理为PDH提供了一条途径，但实际的催化循环可能更为复杂，碳正离子和烷基途径可能根据特定的Ga物种结构和反应条件而竞争或共存。

The alkyl mechanism for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) on gallium-based catalysts involves several key steps:

1. Initial activation: The propane molecule adsorbs on the gallium active site, likely in a side-on fashion.

2. CH bond activation: The undercoordinated GaH species performs an electrophilic attack on the propane, causing an SN2-like inversion of the methyl group. This forms a GaC bond and generates a Brønsted acid site.

3. Alkyl intermediate formation: This step results in the formation of a Gaalkyl species, specifically [HGaC3H7]+ in the case of propane.

4. Alkene desorption: The propene product desorbs from the Gaalkyl intermediate, leaving behind a gallium dihydride species [GaH2]+.

5. Catalyst regeneration: The final step involves the removal of H2 to regenerate the active GaH site.

Compared to the carbenium mechanism, the alkyl mechanism generally has lower activation barriers for the initial CH bond activation step. However, the subsequent alkene desorption step in the alkyl mechanism faces a very high activation barrier (around 60 kcal/mol for ethene), which is not present in the carbenium pathway.

The CH activation step is often proposed as the rate-determining step (RDS) in PDH reactions because it involves breaking a strong CH bond and typically has a significant activation barrier. However, for the alkyl mechanism specifically, the alkene desorption step may actually be rate-limiting due to its unexpectedly high barrier.

The alkyl mechanism can apply to different Ga species structures, including monofunctional Ga+ sites and bifunctional [GaH]2+ sites associated with framework Al pairs in zeolites. The specific energetics and relative favorability of the alkyl vs. carbenium mechanisms may vary depending on the exact nature and environment of the Ga active sites.

镓基催化剂上丙烷脱氢（PDH）的烷基机理包括几个关键步骤：

1. 初始活化：丙烷分子吸附在镓活性位点上，可能以侧向方式吸附。

2. CH键活化：配位不饱和的GaH物种对丙烷进行亲电攻击，导致甲基发生类似SN2的翻转。这形成了GaC键并产生了Brønsted酸位点。

3. 烷基中间体形成：这一步骤导致形成镓烷基物种，在丙烷的情况下特指[HGaC3H7]+。

4. 烯烃脱附：丙烯产物从镓烷基中间体脱附，留下镓二氢化物物种[GaH2]+。

5. 催化剂再生：最后一步涉及H2的去除，以再生活性GaH位点。

与碳正离子机理相比，烷基机理在初始CH键活化步骤上通常具有较低的活化能垒。然而，烷基机理中随后的烯烃脱附步骤面临非常高的活化能垒（乙烯约为60 kcal/mol），这在碳正离子途径中并不存在。

CH活化步骤通常被提出为PDH反应的速率决定步骤（RDS），因为它涉及打破强CH键，通常具有显著的活化能垒。然而，对于烷基机理来说，由于其意外的高能垒，烯烃脱附步骤实际上可能是速率限制步骤。

烷基机理可以适用于不同的Ga物种结构，包括单功能Ga+位点和与沸石中骨架Al对相关的双功能[GaH]2+位点。烷基与碳正离子机理的具体能量学和相对优势可能会因Ga活性位点的确切性质和环境而有所不同。

The alkyl mechanism in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions on gallium-based catalysts involves several key steps:

1. Initial propane activation: The C-H bond in propane is polarized, with the carbon acquiring a slight negative charge and the hydrogen a slight positive charge. 

2. Formation of intermediates: This polarization leads to the formation of a metal-alkyl species (Ga-C3H7) and a Brønsted acid site.

3. Product formation: The final step involves the removal of the alkene (propene) from the metal-alkyl intermediate.

Compared to the carbenium mechanism, the alkyl mechanism differs in the initial C-H bond polarization and the nature of the intermediates formed. In the carbenium mechanism, the carbon acquires a positive charge, leading to the formation of an alkoxide and metal hydride intermediate.

The C-H activation step is often proposed as the rate-determining step (RDS) in the alkyl mechanism. However, for gallium-based catalysts, the study suggests that ethene removal from the Ga-alkyl intermediate has a very high activation barrier (60 kcal/mol). This indicates that the Ga-alkyl species may be a dominant surface intermediate but act as a spectator rather than an active participant in the reaction.

The alkyl mechanism applies differently to various Ga species structures based on their stability and the distance between Al-Al pairs in the zeolite framework. The study found that as the Al-Al distance increases (from 6-membered to 8-membered rings), the stability of the Ga sites decreases. This affects the ease of C-H activation and subsequent steps in the alkyl mechanism.

The researchers observed a linear Brønsted-Evans-Polanyi relation for alkyl activation, carbenium activation, and hydrogen removal steps. This relationship suggests that the activation energy for these steps correlates with the thermodynamic properties of the reaction, which can vary depending on the specific Ga species structure.

丙烷脱氢(PDH)反应在镓基催化剂上的烷基机理包括几个关键步骤：

1. 初始丙烷活化：丙烷中的C-H键发生极化，碳原子获得轻微的负电荷，氢原子获得轻微的正电荷。

2. 中间体形成：这种极化导致形成金属-烷基物种(Ga-C3H7)和布朗斯特酸位点。

3. 产物形成：最后一步涉及从金属-烷基中间体中移除烯烃(丙烯)。

与碳正离子机理相比，烷基机理在初始C-H键极化和形成的中间体性质方面有所不同。在碳正离子机理中，碳获得正电荷，导致形成烷氧化物和金属氢化物中间体。

C-H活化步骤通常被认为是烷基机理中的速率决定步骤(RDS)。然而，对于镓基催化剂，研究表明从Ga-烷基中间体中移除乙烯的活化能很高(60 kcal/mol)。这表明Ga-烷基物种可能是主要的表面中间体，但作为旁观者而非反应的活性参与者。

烷基机理对不同的Ga物种结构的应用基于它们的稳定性和沸石框架中Al-Al对之间的距离。研究发现，随着Al-Al距离的增加(从6元环到8元环)，Ga位点的稳定性降低。这影响了C-H活化和烷基机理后续步骤的难易程度。

研究人员观察到烷基活化、碳正离子活化和氢移除步骤存在线性的Brønsted-Evans-Polanyi关系。这种关系表明，这些步骤的活化能与反应的热力学性质相关，而热力学性质可能因特定的Ga物种结构而异。

The alkyl mechanism for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) on gallium-based catalysts involves several key steps:

1. Initial activation: The propane molecule interacts with the gallium active site, likely involving a side-on adsorption configuration.

2. C-H bond activation: The undercoordinated GaH species performs an electrophilic attack on the propane, leading to the formation of a Ga-alkyl intermediate and a Brønsted acid site. This occurs through an SN2-like inversion of the methyl group.

3. β-hydride elimination: The Ga-propyl species undergoes β-hydride elimination to form propene and a Ga-H species.

4. Product desorption: Propene desorbs from the catalyst surface.

5. Catalyst regeneration: The remaining hydrogen atoms recombine and desorb as H2, regenerating the active Ga site.

Compared to the carbenium mechanism, the alkyl mechanism generally has lower activation barriers for the initial C-H bond activation step. However, the subsequent product desorption step in the alkyl mechanism faces a very high activation barrier (around 60 kcal/mol for ethene desorption from a Ga-ethyl species).

The C-H activation step is often proposed as the rate-determining step (RDS) in PDH reactions because it typically has a significant activation barrier and involves breaking a strong C-H bond. However, the high barrier for product desorption in the alkyl mechanism suggests that this step could also be rate-limiting under certain conditions.

The alkyl mechanism can apply to different Ga species structures, including isolated Ga sites and Ga-Al pair sites in zeolites. The exact energetics and prevalence of intermediates may vary depending on the local environment and coordination of the Ga species. For example, Ga-Al pair sites in zeolites have been found to play important roles in dehydrogenation reactions, likely due to their ability to stabilize reaction intermediates and facilitate hydrogen transfer processes.

镓基催化剂上丙烷脱氢（PDH）的烷基机理包括以下几个关键步骤：

1. 初始活化：丙烷分子与镓活性位点相互作用，可能涉及侧向吸附构型。

2. C-H键活化：配位不饱和的GaH物种对丙烷进行亲电攻击，形成Ga-烷基中间体和布伦斯特酸位点。这是通过甲基的SN2型翻转实现的。

3. β-氢消除：Ga-丙基物种经过β-氢消除形成丙烯和Ga-H物种。

4. 产物脱附：丙烯从催化剂表面脱附。

5. 催化剂再生：剩余的氢原子重新结合并以H2形式脱附，使镓活性位点得以再生。

与碳正离子机理相比，烷基机理在初始C-H键活化步骤上通常具有较低的活化能垒。然而，烷基机理中随后的产物脱附步骤面临着很高的活化能垒（从Ga-乙基物种脱附乙烯的能垒约为60 kcal/mol）。

C-H活化步骤通常被认为是PDH反应的决速步骤（RDS），因为它通常具有显著的活化能垒，并涉及强C-H键的断裂。但是，烷基机理中产物脱附的高能垒表明，在某些条件下，这一步骤也可能成为速率限制步骤。

烷基机理可以应用于不同的Ga物种结构，包括孤立的Ga位点和沸石中的Ga-Al配对位点。具体的能量学和中间体的普遍性可能会因Ga物种的局部环境和配位情况而有所不同。例如，沸石中的Ga-Al配对位点被发现在脱氢反应中起着重要作用，这可能是由于它们能够稳定反应中间体并促进氢转移过程。

The alkyl mechanism for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) on gallium-based catalysts involves several key steps:

1. Initial activation: Propane adsorbs on the undercoordinated Ga species in a side-wise fashion.

2. CH bond activation: The GaH species performs an electrophilic attack on the methyl group, leading to an SN2 inversion. This forms a Gaalkyl intermediate and a Brønsted acid site.

3. Alkene formation: The Gaalkyl species undergoes dehydrogenation to form an alkene (propene in PDH).

4. Product desorption: Propene desorbs from the Gaalkyl intermediate, leaving behind a gallium dihydride species.

5. Catalyst regeneration: The active site is regenerated through hydrogen removal.

Compared to the carbenium mechanism, the alkyl mechanism has a lower activation barrier for the initial CH bond activation step. However, the subsequent alkene removal step from the Gaalkyl intermediate has a very high activation barrier (around 60 kcal/mol for ethene).

The CH activation step is often proposed as the rate-determining step (RDS) in PDH reactions. However, this study suggests that for the alkyl mechanism, the alkene removal step might actually be rate-limiting due to its higher activation barrier.

The alkyl mechanism applies to different Ga species structures, but the activation energies vary depending on the stability of the Ga site. The study found a linear BrønstedEvansPolanyi relation between the activation energies and the heat of reduction for the Ga sites, indicating that less stable sites (with larger AlAl distances) tend to have lower activation barriers for alkyl activation.

Overall, while the alkyl mechanism offers a lower barrier for initial CH activation compared to the carbenium mechanism, the high barrier for alkene desorption suggests that the Gaalkyl species might act more as a spectator than an active intermediate in the overall dehydrogenation process.

烷基机理适用于不同的Ga物种结构，但活化能因Ga位点的稳定性而异。研究发现Ga位点的活化能与还原热之间存在线性的BrønstedEvansPolanyi关系，表明不太稳定的位点（具有较大AlAl距离）倾向于具有较低的烷基活化能垒。

总的来说，虽然烷基机理相比碳正离子机理提供了更低的初始CH活化能垒，但烯烃脱附的高能垒表明，在整个脱氢过程中，Ga烷基物种可能更多地充当旁观者而非活性中间体。
