[1] "Alkyl activation involves CH polarization in such a way that the carbon develops a negative (δ) charge and the hydrogen develops a positive (δ+) charge. Alkyl activation leads to the formation of a metal-alkyl (MCnH2n+1) and the Brnsted acid as intermediates."

[2] "We find that carbenium activation involves CH bond polarization in such a way that the carbon atom assumes a positive partial charge (δ+) and hydrogen assumes a negative partial charge (δ). Carbenium activation leads to the formation of alkoxide and metal hydride (MH) as an intermediate."

[3] "Although alkyl activation is much more facile than the carbenium activation, ethene removal from [HGaC2H5]+Z
m intermediate faces a very high activation barrier of 60 kcal/mol. Thus, we conclude that this intermediate will be a spectator species while dominating the surface intermediates."

[4] "We find a linear BrnstedEvansPolanyi relation for such mechanistic steps as carbenium activation, alkyl activation, and hydrogen removal."

[5] "We also find that with increasing distance between AlAl, from a 6-membered ring to an 8-membered ring (S6a S6b Z8a Z8b), the sites reduced stability is evident from the decreased heat of reduction (H 0

The alkyl mechanism in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions on gallium-based catalysts involves several key steps:

1. Initial propane activation: The C-H bond in propane is polarized, with the carbon acquiring a slight negative charge and the hydrogen a slight positive charge. 

2. Formation of intermediates: This polarization leads to the formation of a metal-alkyl species (Ga-C3H7) and a Brønsted acid site.

3. Product formation: The final step involves the removal of the alkene (propene) from the metal-alkyl intermediate.

Compared to the carbenium mechanism, the alkyl mechanism differs in the initial C-H bond polarization and the nature of the intermediates formed. In the carbenium mechanism, the carbon acquires a positive charge, leading to the formation of an alkoxide and metal hydride intermediate.

The C-H activation step is often proposed as the rate-determining step (RDS) in the alkyl mechanism. However, for gallium-based catalysts, the study suggests that ethene removal from the Ga-alkyl intermediate has a very high activation barrier (60 kcal/mol). This indicates that the Ga-alkyl species may be a dominant surface intermediate but act as a spectator rather than an active participant in the reaction.

The alkyl mechanism applies differently to various Ga species structures based on their stability and the distance between Al-Al pairs in the zeolite framework. The study found that as the Al-Al distance increases (from 6-membered to 8-membered rings), the stability of the Ga sites decreases. This affects the ease of C-H activation and subsequent steps in the alkyl mechanism.

The researchers observed a linear Brønsted-Evans-Polanyi relation for alkyl activation, carbenium activation, and hydrogen removal steps. This relationship suggests that the activation energy for these steps correlates with the thermodynamic properties of the reaction, which can vary depending on the specific Ga species structure.

丙烷脱氢(PDH)反应在镓基催化剂上的烷基机理包括几个关键步骤：

1. 初始丙烷活化：丙烷中的C-H键发生极化，碳原子获得轻微的负电荷，氢原子获得轻微的正电荷。

2. 中间体形成：这种极化导致形成金属-烷基物种(Ga-C3H7)和布朗斯特酸位点。

3. 产物形成：最后一步涉及从金属-烷基中间体中移除烯烃(丙烯)。

与碳正离子机理相比，烷基机理在初始C-H键极化和形成的中间体性质方面有所不同。在碳正离子机理中，碳获得正电荷，导致形成烷氧化物和金属氢化物中间体。

C-H活化步骤通常被认为是烷基机理中的速率决定步骤(RDS)。然而，对于镓基催化剂，研究表明从Ga-烷基中间体中移除乙烯的活化能很高(60 kcal/mol)。这表明Ga-烷基物种可能是主要的表面中间体，但作为旁观者而非反应的活性参与者。

烷基机理对不同的Ga物种结构的应用基于它们的稳定性和沸石框架中Al-Al对之间的距离。研究发现，随着Al-Al距离的增加(从6元环到8元环)，Ga位点的稳定性降低。这影响了C-H活化和烷基机理后续步骤的难易程度。

研究人员观察到烷基活化、碳正离子活化和氢移除步骤存在线性的Brønsted-Evans-Polanyi关系。这种关系表明，这些步骤的活化能与反应的热力学性质相关，而热力学性质可能因特定的Ga物种结构而异。
