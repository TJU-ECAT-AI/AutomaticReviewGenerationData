"Scheme 3 shows a generalized catalytic cycle for dehydrogenation starting with alkyl activation, including all possible intermediates along any alkyl activation path."

"The intermediate D further undergoes alkyl activation as shown in Scheme 3 (D [E] F). The mechanistic step is seen as the SN2 inversion of the methyl group caused by the electrophilic attack of the undercoordinated GaH species."

"Alkyl activation is followed by desorption of an alkene (ethene) from the Gaalkyl intermediate (F [I] J K + C2H4), leaving behind the gallium dihydride species ([GaH2]+Z
m)."

"Although alkyl activation is much more facile than the carbenium activation, ethene removal from [HGaC2H5]+Z
m intermediate faces a very high activation barrier of 60 kcal/mol."

"We find a linear BrnstedEvansPolanyi relation for such mechanistic steps as carbenium activation, alkyl activation, and hydrogen removal."

"Alkyl activation involves CH polarization in such a way that the carbon develops a negative (δ) charge and the hydrogen develops a positive (δ+) charge. Alkyl activation leads to the formation of a metal-alkyl (MCnH2n+1) and the Brnsted acid as intermediates."

The alkyl mechanism for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) on gallium-based catalysts involves several key steps:

1. Initial activation: Propane adsorbs on the undercoordinated Ga species, likely in a side-on fashion.

2. C-H bond activation: The GaH species performs an electrophilic attack on the propane, causing an SN2-like inversion of the methyl group. This forms a Ga-C bond and generates a Brønsted acid site. The C-H bond is polarized such that the carbon develops a negative (δ-) charge and the hydrogen a positive (δ+) charge.

3. Formation of Ga-alkyl intermediate: This step results in the formation of a Ga-alkyl species, specifically [HGaC3H7]+ in the case of propane.

4. β-hydride elimination: The Ga-propyl species undergoes β-hydride elimination to form propene and a Ga-H species.

5. Product desorption: Propene desorbs from the Ga-alkyl intermediate, leaving behind a gallium dihydride species [GaH2]+.

6. Catalyst regeneration: The final step involves the removal of H2 to regenerate the active GaH site.

Compared to the carbenium mechanism, the alkyl mechanism generally has lower activation barriers for the initial C-H bond activation step. However, the subsequent alkene desorption step in the alkyl mechanism faces a very high activation barrier (around 60 kcal/mol for ethene), which is not present in the carbenium pathway.

The C-H activation step is often proposed as the rate-determining step (RDS) in PDH reactions because it involves breaking a strong C-H bond and typically has a significant activation barrier. However, for the alkyl mechanism specifically, the alkene desorption step may actually be rate-limiting due to its unexpectedly high barrier.

The researchers observed a linear Brønsted-Evans-Polanyi relation for alkyl activation, carbenium activation, and hydrogen removal steps. This relationship suggests that the activation energy for these steps correlates with the thermodynamic properties of the reaction, which can vary depending on the specific Ga species structure.

The alkyl mechanism can apply to different Ga species structures, including monofunctional Ga+ sites and bifunctional [GaH]2+ sites associated with framework Al pairs in zeolites. The specific energetics and relative favorability of the alkyl vs. carbenium mechanisms may vary depending on the exact nature and environment of the Ga active sites.

镓基催化剂上丙烷脱氢（PDH）的烷基机理包括几个关键步骤：

1. 初始活化：丙烷以侧向方式吸附在配位不饱和的Ga物种上。

2. C-H键活化：GaH物种对丙烷进行亲电攻击，导致甲基发生类似SN2的翻转。这形成了Ga-C键并产生了Brønsted酸位点。C-H键发生极化，使碳原子获得轻微的负电荷（δ-），氢原子获得轻微的正电荷（δ+）。

3. Ga-烷基中间体形成：这一步骤导致形成镓烷基物种，在丙烷的情况下特指[HGaC3H7]+。

4. β-氢消除：Ga-丙基物种经过β-氢消除形成丙烯和Ga-H物种。

5. 产物脱附：丙烯从Ga-烷基中间体脱附，留下镓二氢化物物种[GaH2]+。

6. 催化剂再生：最后一步涉及H2的去除，以再生活性GaH位点。

与碳正离子机理相比，烷基机理在初始C-H键活化步骤上通常具有较低的活化能垒。然而，烷基机理中随后的烯烃脱附步骤面临非常高的活化能垒（乙烯约为60 kcal/mol），这在碳正离子途径中并不存在。

C-H活化步骤通常被认为是PDH反应的速率决定步骤（RDS），因为它涉及打破强C-H键，通常具有显著的活化能垒。然而，对于烷基机理来说，由于其意外的高能垒，烯烃脱附步骤实际上可能是速率限制步骤。

研究人员观察到烷基活化、碳正离子活化和氢移除步骤存在线性的Brønsted-Evans-Polanyi关系。这种关系表明，这些步骤的活化能与反应的热力学性质相关，而热力学性质可能因特定的Ga物种结构而异。

烷基机理可以适用于不同的Ga物种结构，包括单功能Ga+位点和与沸石中骨架Al对相关的双功能[GaH]2+位点。烷基与碳正离子机理的具体能量学和相对优势可能会因Ga活性位点的确切性质和环境而有所不同。
