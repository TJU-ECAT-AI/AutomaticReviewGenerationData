[1] "Scheme 3 shows a generalized catalytic cycle for dehydrogenation starting with alkyl activation, including all possible intermediates along any alkyl activation path."

[2] "The intermediate D further undergoes alkyl activation as shown in Scheme 3 (D [E] F). The mechanistic step is seen as the SN2 inversion of the methyl group caused by the electrophilic attack of the undercoordinated GaH species."

[3] "Alkyl activation is followed by desorption of an alkene (ethene) from the Gaalkyl intermediate (F [I] J K + C2H4), leaving behind the gallium dihydride species ([GaH2]+Z

The alkyl mechanism for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) on gallium-based catalysts involves several key steps:

1. Initial activation: Propane adsorbs on the undercoordinated Ga species in a side-wise fashion.

2. CH bond activation: The GaH species performs an electrophilic attack on the methyl group, leading to an SN2 inversion. This forms a Gaalkyl intermediate and a Brønsted acid site.

3. Alkene formation: The Gaalkyl species undergoes dehydrogenation to form an alkene (propene in PDH).

4. Product desorption: Propene desorbs from the Gaalkyl intermediate, leaving behind a gallium dihydride species.

5. Catalyst regeneration: The active site is regenerated through hydrogen removal.

Compared to the carbenium mechanism, the alkyl mechanism has a lower activation barrier for the initial CH bond activation step. However, the subsequent alkene removal step from the Gaalkyl intermediate has a very high activation barrier (around 60 kcal/mol for ethene).

The CH activation step is often proposed as the rate-determining step (RDS) in PDH reactions. However, this study suggests that for the alkyl mechanism, the alkene removal step might actually be rate-limiting due to its higher activation barrier.

The alkyl mechanism applies to different Ga species structures, but the activation energies vary depending on the stability of the Ga site. The study found a linear BrønstedEvansPolanyi relation between the activation energies and the heat of reduction for the Ga sites, indicating that less stable sites (with larger AlAl distances) tend to have lower activation barriers for alkyl activation.

Overall, while the alkyl mechanism offers a lower barrier for initial CH activation compared to the carbenium mechanism, the high barrier for alkene desorption suggests that the Gaalkyl species might act more as a spectator than an active intermediate in the overall dehydrogenation process.

镓基催化剂上丙烷脱氢(PDH)的烷基机理包括几个关键步骤：

1. 初始活化：丙烷以侧向方式吸附在配位不饱和的Ga物种上。

2. CH键活化：GaH物种对甲基进行亲电攻击，导致SN2反转。这形成了Ga烷基中间体和布朗斯特酸位点。

3. 烯烃形成：Ga烷基物种进行脱氢反应形成烯烃（在PDH中为丙烯）。

4. 产物脱附：丙烯从Ga烷基中间体脱附，留下镓二氢化物物种。

5. 催化剂再生：通过氢气移除再生活性位点。

与碳正离子机理相比，烷基机理在初始CH键活化步骤中具有较低的活化能垒。然而，随后从Ga烷基中间体中移除烯烃的步骤具有很高的活化能垒（乙烯约为60 kcal/mol）。

CH活化步骤通常被认为是PDH反应的决速步骤（RDS）。但是，这项研究表明，对于烷基机理，由于其较高的活化能垒，烯烃移除步骤实际上可能是速率限制步骤。

烷基机理适用于不同的Ga物种结构，但活化能因Ga位点的稳定性而异。研究发现Ga位点的活化能与还原热之间存在线性的BrønstedEvansPolanyi关系，表明不太稳定的位点（具有较大AlAl距离）倾向于具有较低的烷基活化能垒。

总的来说，虽然烷基机理相比碳正离子机理提供了更低的初始CH活化能垒，但烯烃脱附的高能垒表明，在整个脱氢过程中，Ga烷基物种可能更多地充当旁观者而非活性中间体。
