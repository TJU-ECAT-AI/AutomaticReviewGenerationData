[1] "Scheme 3 shows a generalized catalytic cycle for dehydrogenation starting with alkyl activation, including all possible intermediates along any alkyl activation path."

[2] "The intermediate D further undergoes alkyl activation as shown in Scheme 3 (D [E] F). The mechanistic step is seen as the SN2 inversion of the methyl group caused by the electrophilic attack of the undercoordinated GaH species."

m intermediate faces a very high activation barrier of 60 kcal/mol."

The alkyl mechanism for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) on gallium-based catalysts involves several key steps:

1. Initial activation: The propane molecule interacts with the gallium active site, likely involving a side-on adsorption configuration.

2. C-H bond activation: The undercoordinated GaH species performs an electrophilic attack on the propane, leading to the formation of a Ga-alkyl intermediate and a Brønsted acid site. This occurs through an SN2-like inversion of the methyl group.

3. β-hydride elimination: The Ga-propyl species undergoes β-hydride elimination to form propene and a Ga-H species.

4. Product desorption: Propene desorbs from the catalyst surface.

5. Catalyst regeneration: The remaining hydrogen atoms recombine and desorb as H2, regenerating the active Ga site.

Compared to the carbenium mechanism, the alkyl mechanism generally has lower activation barriers for the initial C-H bond activation step. However, the subsequent product desorption step in the alkyl mechanism faces a very high activation barrier (around 60 kcal/mol for ethene desorption from a Ga-ethyl species).

The C-H activation step is often proposed as the rate-determining step (RDS) in PDH reactions because it typically has a significant activation barrier and involves breaking a strong C-H bond. However, the high barrier for product desorption in the alkyl mechanism suggests that this step could also be rate-limiting under certain conditions.

The alkyl mechanism can apply to different Ga species structures, including isolated Ga sites and Ga-Al pair sites in zeolites. The exact energetics and prevalence of intermediates may vary depending on the local environment and coordination of the Ga species. For example, Ga-Al pair sites in zeolites have been found to play important roles in dehydrogenation reactions, likely due to their ability to stabilize reaction intermediates and facilitate hydrogen transfer processes.

镓基催化剂上丙烷脱氢（PDH）的烷基机理包括以下几个关键步骤：

1. 初始活化：丙烷分子与镓活性位点相互作用，可能涉及侧向吸附构型。

2. C-H键活化：配位不饱和的GaH物种对丙烷进行亲电攻击，形成Ga-烷基中间体和布伦斯特酸位点。这是通过甲基的SN2型翻转实现的。

3. β-氢消除：Ga-丙基物种经过β-氢消除形成丙烯和Ga-H物种。

4. 产物脱附：丙烯从催化剂表面脱附。

5. 催化剂再生：剩余的氢原子重新结合并以H2形式脱附，使镓活性位点得以再生。

与碳正离子机理相比，烷基机理在初始C-H键活化步骤上通常具有较低的活化能垒。然而，烷基机理中随后的产物脱附步骤面临着很高的活化能垒（从Ga-乙基物种脱附乙烯的能垒约为60 kcal/mol）。

C-H活化步骤通常被认为是PDH反应的决速步骤（RDS），因为它通常具有显著的活化能垒，并涉及强C-H键的断裂。但是，烷基机理中产物脱附的高能垒表明，在某些条件下，这一步骤也可能成为速率限制步骤。

烷基机理可以应用于不同的Ga物种结构，包括孤立的Ga位点和沸石中的Ga-Al配对位点。具体的能量学和中间体的普遍性可能会因Ga物种的局部环境和配位情况而有所不同。例如，沸石中的Ga-Al配对位点被发现在脱氢反应中起着重要作用，这可能是由于它们能够稳定反应中间体并促进氢转移过程。
