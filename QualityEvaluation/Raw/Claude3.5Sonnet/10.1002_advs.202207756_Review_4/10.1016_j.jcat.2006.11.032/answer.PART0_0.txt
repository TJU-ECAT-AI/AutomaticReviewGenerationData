[1] "We provide a theoretical evidence to support the proposition of [GaH]+ near-pair framework Al sites as being the active catalytic sites for ethane dehydrogenation."

[2] "As shown in Scheme 1, alkenes can be generated by (a) protolytic dehydrogenation, (b) protolytic cracking, or (c) hydride transfer."

[3] "Frash and van Santen [41] considered a similar gallium site to study the ethane dehydrogenation reaction pathway. The authors classified the reaction paths as of two types: (a) a carbenium activation pathway consisting of an alkoxide-like intermediate along the reaction path after the activation of the CH (Rδ+Hδ) bond, and (b) an alkyl activation pathway supporting the formation of GaC coordination after the activation of the CH bond (RδHδ+)."

[4] "Although alkyl activation is much more facile than the carbenium activation, ethene removal from [HGaC2H5]+Z
m intermediate faces a very high activation barrier of 60 kcal/mol. Thus, we conclude that this intermediate will be a spectator species while dominating the surface intermediates."

[5] "We find a linear BrnstedEvansPolanyi relation for such mechanistic steps as carbenium activation, alkyl activation, and hydrogen removal."

The alkyl mechanism in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions on gallium-based catalysts involves several key steps:

1. Initial propane activation: The C-H bond in propane is activated by the gallium species, forming a Ga-C bond and releasing a proton. This step involves the polarization of the C-H bond such that the carbon develops a negative charge (δ-) and the hydrogen a positive charge (δ+).

2. Formation of Ga-alkyl intermediate: The activated propane forms a [HGaC3H7]+ intermediate species bound to the zeolite framework.

3. β-hydride elimination: A hydrogen from the β-carbon is eliminated, forming a π-complex between the resulting propene and the Ga species.

4. Product desorption: The propene desorbs from the catalyst surface, leaving behind a [GaH2]+ species.

5. Catalyst regeneration: The [GaH2]+ species releases H2 to regenerate the active Ga site.

Comparing the alkyl mechanism to the carbenium mechanism:

- Carbenium activation involves C-H bond polarization where carbon assumes a positive charge (δ+) and hydrogen a negative charge (δ-), leading to an alkoxide-like intermediate.
- Alkyl activation results in the formation of a Ga-C bond, whereas carbenium activation leads to an alkoxide species.
- The alkyl mechanism is generally more facile for the initial C-H activation step compared to the carbenium mechanism.

The C-H activation step is often proposed as the rate-determining step (RDS) because:

- It involves breaking a strong C-H bond, which typically requires significant energy.
- Subsequent steps like β-hydride elimination are usually faster.
- The activation energy for this step correlates well with overall reaction rates.

However, for Ga-based catalysts, the study suggests that while alkyl C-H activation is facile, the removal of the alkene (e.g., ethene from [HGaC2H5]+) faces a very high activation barrier. This indicates that the alkyl species may actually be a spectator rather than an active intermediate.

The alkyl mechanism applies to different Ga species structures as follows:

- The activity of the Ga sites depends on their coordination environment within the zeolite framework.
- Pair Al sites in the zeolite framework play an important role in stabilizing the Ga species and influencing their catalytic activity.
- The distance between Al pairs affects the stability and activity of the Ga sites, with an optimal distance providing a balance between activity and stability (Sabatier principle).
- Different ring structures (e.g., 4-, 5-, 6-, or 8-membered rings) in the zeolite framework influence the Ga species' stability and catalytic performance.
- The mechanism's effectiveness varies with the Ga species' reducibility, which is influenced by the zeolite structure and reaction conditions.

In summary, while the alkyl mechanism provides a pathway for PDH, the actual catalytic cycle may be more complex, with carbenium and alkyl pathways potentially competing or coexisting depending on the specific Ga species structure and reaction conditions.

镓基催化剂上丙烷脱氢(PDH)反应的烷基机理涉及几个关键步骤：

1. 初始丙烷活化：丙烷中的C-H键被镓物种活化，形成Ga-C键并释放质子。这一步骤涉及C-H键的极化，使碳形成负电荷(δ-)，氢形成正电荷(δ+)。

2. 形成Ga-烷基中间体：活化的丙烷形成与沸石骨架结合的[HGaC3H7]+中间体物种。

3. β-氢消除：β-碳上的氢被消除，在生成的丙烯和Ga物种之间形成π-络合物。

4. 产物脱附：丙烯从催化剂表面脱附，留下[GaH2]+物种。

5. 催化剂再生：[GaH2]+物种释放H2以再生活性Ga位点。

将烷基机理与碳正离子机理进行比较：

- 碳正离子活化涉及C-H键极化，其中碳呈正电荷(δ+)，氢呈负电荷(δ-)，导致类烷氧化物中间体。
- 烷基活化导致Ga-C键的形成，而碳正离子活化导致烷氧化物物种。
- 对于初始C-H活化步骤，烷基机理通常比碳正离子机理更容易进行。

C-H活化步骤常被提议为速率决定步骤(RDS)，因为：

- 它涉及打破强C-H键，通常需要大量能量。
- 后续步骤如β-氢消除通常更快。
- 这一步骤的活化能与总体反应速率有很好的相关性。

然而，对于Ga基催化剂，研究表明虽然烷基C-H活化容易进行，但烯烃的移除（例如从[HGaC2H5]+中移除乙烯）面临很高的活化能垒。这表明烷基物种可能实际上是一个旁观者而非活性中间体。

烷基机理适用于不同Ga物种结构的方式如下：

- Ga位点的活性取决于它们在沸石骨架中的配位环境。
- 沸石骨架中的铝对位点在稳定Ga物种和影响其催化活性方面起重要作用。
- 铝对之间的距离影响Ga位点的稳定性和活性，最佳距离提供活性和稳定性之间的平衡（Sabatier原理）。
- 沸石骨架中的不同环结构（如4-、5-、6-或8元环）影响Ga物种的稳定性和催化性能。
- 机理的有效性随Ga物种的可还原性而变化，这受沸石结构和反应条件的影响。

总之，虽然烷基机理为PDH提供了一条途径，但实际的催化循环可能更为复杂，碳正离子和烷基途径可能根据特定的Ga物种结构和反应条件而竞争或共存。
