The provided literature does not contain specific information about the alkyl mechanism in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions on gallium-based catalysts. The text focuses on density functional theory studies of gallium-exchanged mordenite and various reconstructions of catalytic active sites, but does not discuss the detailed mechanism of propane dehydrogenation. 

The document does not provide information to compare the alkyl mechanism to the carbenium mechanism, nor does it discuss why the C-H activation step is proposed as the rate-determining step in PDH reactions. 

While the text mentions some gallium species structures like Ga(III)Hx, Ga(II)Ga(II)Hx, and Ga(III)Ga(I)Hx, it does not explain how the alkyl mechanism applies to these different structures in the context of propane dehydrogenation.

The literature primarily focuses on computational studies of gallium sites in mordenite zeolites and their potential reconstructions, rather than providing detailed mechanistic insights into propane dehydrogenation reactions.

该文档没有提供比较烷基机理和碳正离子机理的信息,也没有讨论为什么C-H活化步骤被提出作为PDH反应的速率决定步骤。

虽然文本提到了一些镓物种结构,如Ga(III)Hx、Ga(II)Ga(II)Hx和Ga(III)Ga(I)Hx,但它没有解释烷基机理如何应用于这些不同结构的丙烷脱氢背景。

该文献主要集中在mordenite沸石中镓位点的计算研究及其潜在的重构上,而不是提供丙烷脱氢反应的详细机理见解。

[1] "Although sodium or proton-exchanged zeolites also shows some catalytic activity in dehydrogenation reactions [6], the activity is rather low due to the high barriers associated with the generation of carbonium ions. Gallium-exchanged zeolites allow higher dehydrogenation activities [5,7]."

[2] "The details of the reaction mechanisms and the nature of the gallium active sites in these reactions are not precisely known [11,12]."

[3] "The limiting step in dehydrogenation of ethane catalyzed by a gallium-exchanged zeolite cluster model corresponds to a transition state structure that leads to the formation of ethene from ethyl chemisorbed to GaH-Z, where Z is the zeolite cluster (see TS3 in Scheme 2)."

[4] "We will check different alternatives of the reconstruction of gallium-exchanged zeolite."

[5] "It is possible to generate a Brnsted acidic site starting from a [GaH2]-zeolite structure [34]. We have checked the reconstruction in which [Ga(III)H2]-MOR evolves toward H-MOR (Figs. 1 and 2)."

The literature does not provide a comprehensive explanation of the alkyl mechanism for propane dehydrogenation on gallium-based catalysts. However, it does offer some insights into dehydrogenation reactions on gallium-exchanged zeolites:

1. Gallium-exchanged zeolites show higher dehydrogenation activity compared to sodium or proton-exchanged zeolites. This is because the latter have high barriers for generating carbonium ions.

2. The exact reaction mechanisms and nature of gallium active sites are not precisely known.

3. For ethane dehydrogenation on a gallium-exchanged zeolite cluster model, the rate-determining step involves the formation of ethene from ethyl chemisorbed to GaH-Z.

4. Various reconstructions of gallium-exchanged zeolite structures are possible, including the generation of Brønsted acidic sites from [GaH2]-zeolite structures.

5. The study focuses on different alternatives for gallium species structures in zeolites, but does not explicitly compare alkyl and carbenium mechanisms or explain why C-H activation is proposed as the rate-determining step.

Given the limited information provided in the literature about the specific alkyl mechanism for propane dehydrogenation on gallium catalysts, a comprehensive explanation of the mechanism and comparisons to the carbenium mechanism cannot be provided based solely on this document.

这篇文献并没有提供镓基催化剂上丙烷脱氢反应的烷基机理的全面解释。但是，它确实提供了一些关于镓交换沸石上脱氢反应的见解：

1. 与钠或质子交换的沸石相比，镓交换沸石表现出更高的脱氢活性。这是因为后者在产生碳正离子时存在较高的能垒。

2. 确切的反应机理和镓活性位点的性质尚未精确了解。

3. 对于镓交换沸石簇模型上的乙烷脱氢，决速步骤涉及从化学吸附在GaH-Z上的乙基形成乙烯。

4. 镓交换沸石结构可能发生各种重构，包括从[GaH2]-沸石结构生成Brønsted酸性位点。

5. 该研究关注沸石中镓物种结构的不同替代方案，但没有明确比较烷基和碳正离子机理，也没有解释为什么C-H活化被提议为决速步骤。

鉴于文献中关于镓催化剂上丙烷脱氢特定烷基机理的信息有限，仅基于这份文档无法提供该机理的全面解释，也无法与碳正离子机理进行比较。

[1] "Gallium-exchanged zeolites allow higher dehydrogenation activities [5,7]. Nevertheless, high reaction temperatures are still needed because of the endothermic nature of dehydrogenation reactions [8]."

[2] "The limiting step in dehydrogenation of ethane catalyzed by a gallium-exchanged zeolite cluster model corresponds to a transition state structure that leads to the formation of ethene from ethyl chemisorbed to GaH-Z, where Z is the zeolite cluster (see TS3 in Scheme 2)."

[3] "It is found that a number of structures in which gallium is present as Ga(III)Hx, Ga(II)Ga(II)Hx, and Ga(III)Ga(I)Hx can be reached under alkane dehydrogenation conditions."

The provided literature does not contain comprehensive information about the alkyl mechanism in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions on gallium-based catalysts. However, based on the limited information available, we can infer some aspects of the mechanism and discuss the gallium species involved:

1. Gallium-exchanged zeolites are active catalysts for dehydrogenation reactions, showing higher activities compared to other zeolites.

2. The dehydrogenation reaction is endothermic, requiring high temperatures to proceed.

3. For ethane dehydrogenation (which can be analogous to propane dehydrogenation), the rate-determining step involves the formation of ethene from an ethyl species chemisorbed to a GaH-zeolite site.

4. Various gallium species can be present under dehydrogenation conditions, including Ga(III)Hx, Ga(II)Ga(II)Hx, and Ga(III)Ga(I)Hx structures.

The alkyl mechanism likely involves the following general steps:
1. Adsorption of propane on the gallium active site
2. C-H bond activation to form a propyl intermediate
3. β-hydride elimination to form propene
4. Desorption of propene and hydrogen

The literature does not provide specific information about the carbenium mechanism or why the C-H activation step is proposed as the rate-determining step. However, the presence of various gallium species suggests that the mechanism may involve different active sites depending on the reaction conditions and catalyst state.

虽然提供的文献中没有关于镓基催化剂上丙烷脱氢(PDH)反应的烷基机理的全面信息，但根据有限的可用信息，我们可以推断出机理的一些方面并讨论涉及的镓物种：

1. 镓交换的沸石是脱氢反应的活性催化剂，与其他沸石相比显示出更高的活性。

2. 脱氢反应是吸热的，需要高温才能进行。

3. 对于乙烷脱氢（可类比于丙烷脱氢），速率决定步骤涉及从化学吸附在GaH-沸石位点上的乙基物种形成乙烯。

4. 在脱氢条件下可以存在各种镓物种，包括Ga(III)Hx、Ga(II)Ga(II)Hx和Ga(III)Ga(I)Hx结构。

烷基机理可能涉及以下一般步骤：
1. 丙烷在镓活性位上吸附
2. C-H键活化形成丙基中间体
3. β-氢消除形成丙烯
4. 丙烯和氢气脱附

文献没有提供关于碳正离子机理或为什么C-H活化步骤被提议为速率决定步骤的具体信息。然而，各种镓物种的存在表明，该机理可能涉及不同的活性位点，这取决于反应条件和催化剂状态。

The literature does not provide a comprehensive explanation of the alkyl mechanism in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions on gallium-based catalysts. However, it does mention some relevant points:

1. The exact reaction mechanisms and nature of gallium active sites are not fully understood.

2. For ethane dehydrogenation, the rate-limiting step involves the formation of ethene from an ethyl group chemisorbed to a GaH-zeolite site.

3. Various gallium species structures can form under dehydrogenation conditions, including Ga(III)Hx, Ga(II)Ga(II)Hx, and Ga(III)Ga(I)Hx.

The document does not provide details on the complete alkyl mechanism, its comparison to the carbenium mechanism, or why C-H activation is proposed as the rate-determining step. It also does not explain how the alkyl mechanism applies to different Ga species structures. More specific research on propane dehydrogenation mechanisms would be needed to fully answer the question.

[1] "Frash and Van Santen have performed a quantum chemical study of the dehydrogenation of ethane by gallium-exchanged zeolite [11]. For this purpose, they used as model of the gallium-exchanged zeolite catalyst a small molecular fragment within the framework of the cluster approach [14,15]."

[2] "The most likely reaction sequence is depicted in Scheme 2. The limiting step in dehydrogenation of ethane catalyzed by a gallium-exchanged zeolite cluster model corresponds to a transition state structure that leads to the formation of ethene from ethyl chemisorbed to GaH-Z, where Z is the zeolite cluster (see TS3 in Scheme 2)."

[3] "One notices that the energy barrier of the rate-limiting step in this reaction pathway is particularly high. A possible reason for this is probably inherent to the cluster approach method."

[4] "It is now well understood that the zeolite framework can have a significant stabilizing effect of transition state structures [15,16]."

[5] "Although sodium or proton-exchanged zeolites also shows some catalytic activity in dehydrogenation reactions [6], the activity is rather low due to the high barriers associated with the generation of carbonium ions. Gallium-exchanged zeolites allow higher dehydrogenation activities [5,7]."

The literature does not provide a comprehensive explanation of the alkyl mechanism for propane dehydrogenation on gallium-based catalysts. However, it does discuss some aspects of alkane dehydrogenation on gallium-exchanged zeolites, which can be used to infer information about the mechanism:

1. The study focuses on ethane dehydrogenation rather than propane, but the mechanisms are likely similar.

2. The reaction sequence involves the formation of an ethyl species chemisorbed to a GaH-zeolite site, followed by the formation of ethene in the rate-limiting step.

3. The rate-determining step is proposed to be the C-H activation step leading to the formation of the alkene product.

4. Different Ga species structures are mentioned, including Ga(III)Hx, Ga(II)Ga(II)Hx, and Ga(III)Ga(I)Hx, which can be formed under alkane dehydrogenation conditions.

5. The zeolite framework is noted to have a significant stabilizing effect on transition state structures, which may impact the energetics of the reaction steps.

6. Gallium-exchanged zeolites show higher dehydrogenation activities compared to sodium or proton-exchanged zeolites, which is attributed to avoiding the high barriers associated with carbonium ion formation.

The literature does not explicitly compare the alkyl mechanism to the carbenium mechanism. However, it suggests that the alkyl mechanism on gallium-based catalysts may be preferred due to the avoidance of high-energy carbonium ion intermediates.

The study does not provide detailed information on how the alkyl mechanism applies to different Ga species structures, but it implies that various Ga structures can be involved in the catalytic process.

2. 反应序列涉及在GaH-沸石位点上形成化学吸附的乙基物种，然后在限速步骤中形成乙烯。

3. 推测速率决定步骤是导致烯烃产物形成的C-H活化步骤。

4. 提到了不同的Ga物种结构，包括Ga(III)Hx、Ga(II)Ga(II)Hx和Ga(III)Ga(I)Hx，这些结构可以在烷烃脱氢条件下形成。

5. 指出沸石骨架对过渡态结构有显著的稳定作用，这可能影响反应步骤的能量学。

6. 与钠或质子交换的沸石相比，镓交换沸石表现出更高的脱氢活性，这归因于避免了与羰基阳离子形成相关的高能垒。

文献没有明确比较烷基机理和碳正离子机理。然而，它暗示在镓基催化剂上可能更倾向于烷基机理，因为可以避免高能量的羰基阳离子中间体。
