[1] "Gallium-exchanged zeolites allow higher dehydrogenation activities [5,7]. Nevertheless, high reaction temperatures are still needed because of the endothermic nature of dehydrogenation reactions [8]."

[2] "The limiting step in dehydrogenation of ethane catalyzed by a gallium-exchanged zeolite cluster model corresponds to a transition state structure that leads to the formation of ethene from ethyl chemisorbed to GaH-Z, where Z is the zeolite cluster (see TS3 in Scheme 2)."

[3] "It is found that a number of structures in which gallium is present as Ga(III)Hx, Ga(II)Ga(II)Hx, and Ga(III)Ga(I)Hx can be reached under alkane dehydrogenation conditions."

The provided literature does not contain comprehensive information about the alkyl mechanism in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions on gallium-based catalysts. However, based on the limited information available, we can infer some aspects of the mechanism and discuss the gallium species involved:

1. Gallium-exchanged zeolites are active catalysts for dehydrogenation reactions, showing higher activities compared to other zeolites.

2. The dehydrogenation reaction is endothermic, requiring high temperatures to proceed.

3. For ethane dehydrogenation (which can be analogous to propane dehydrogenation), the rate-determining step involves the formation of ethene from an ethyl species chemisorbed to a GaH-zeolite site.

4. Various gallium species can be present under dehydrogenation conditions, including Ga(III)Hx, Ga(II)Ga(II)Hx, and Ga(III)Ga(I)Hx structures.

The alkyl mechanism likely involves the following general steps:
1. Adsorption of propane on the gallium active site
2. C-H bond activation to form a propyl intermediate
3. β-hydride elimination to form propene
4. Desorption of propene and hydrogen

The literature does not provide specific information about the carbenium mechanism or why the C-H activation step is proposed as the rate-determining step. However, the presence of various gallium species suggests that the mechanism may involve different active sites depending on the reaction conditions and catalyst state.

虽然提供的文献中没有关于镓基催化剂上丙烷脱氢(PDH)反应的烷基机理的全面信息，但根据有限的可用信息，我们可以推断出机理的一些方面并讨论涉及的镓物种：

1. 镓交换的沸石是脱氢反应的活性催化剂，与其他沸石相比显示出更高的活性。

2. 脱氢反应是吸热的，需要高温才能进行。

3. 对于乙烷脱氢（可类比于丙烷脱氢），速率决定步骤涉及从化学吸附在GaH-沸石位点上的乙基物种形成乙烯。

4. 在脱氢条件下可以存在各种镓物种，包括Ga(III)Hx、Ga(II)Ga(II)Hx和Ga(III)Ga(I)Hx结构。

烷基机理可能涉及以下一般步骤：
1. 丙烷在镓活性位上吸附
2. C-H键活化形成丙基中间体
3. β-氢消除形成丙烯
4. 丙烯和氢气脱附

文献没有提供关于碳正离子机理或为什么C-H活化步骤被提议为速率决定步骤的具体信息。然而，各种镓物种的存在表明，该机理可能涉及不同的活性位点，这取决于反应条件和催化剂状态。
