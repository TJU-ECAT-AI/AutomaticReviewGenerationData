[1] "The details of the reaction mechanisms and the nature of the gallium active sites in these reactions are not precisely known [11,12]."

[2] "The limiting step in dehydrogenation of ethane catalyzed by a gallium-exchanged zeolite cluster model corresponds to a transition state structure that leads to the formation of ethene from ethyl chemisorbed to GaH-Z, where Z is the zeolite cluster (see TS3 in Scheme 2)."

[3] "Several reconstructions of catalytic active sites in gallium-exchanged mordenite have been analyzed using periodic density functional theory method. It is found that a number of structures in which gallium is present as Ga(III)Hx, Ga(II)Ga(II)Hx, and Ga(III)Ga(I)Hx can be reached under alkane dehydrogenation conditions."

The literature does not provide a comprehensive explanation of the alkyl mechanism in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions on gallium-based catalysts. However, it does mention some relevant points:

1. The exact reaction mechanisms and nature of gallium active sites are not fully understood.

2. For ethane dehydrogenation, the rate-limiting step involves the formation of ethene from an ethyl group chemisorbed to a GaH-zeolite site.

3. Various gallium species structures can form under dehydrogenation conditions, including Ga(III)Hx, Ga(II)Ga(II)Hx, and Ga(III)Ga(I)Hx.

The document does not provide details on the complete alkyl mechanism, its comparison to the carbenium mechanism, or why C-H activation is proposed as the rate-determining step. It also does not explain how the alkyl mechanism applies to different Ga species structures. More specific research on propane dehydrogenation mechanisms would be needed to fully answer the question.

该文献并未提供镓基催化剂上丙烷脱氢(PDH)反应中烷基机理的全面解释。然而，它确实提到了一些相关点：

1. 确切的反应机理和镓活性位点的性质尚未完全了解。

2. 对于乙烷脱氢，速率限制步骤涉及从化学吸附在GaH-沸石位点上的乙基形成乙烯。

3. 在脱氢条件下可以形成各种镓物种结构，包括Ga(III)Hx、Ga(II)Ga(II)Hx和Ga(III)Ga(I)Hx。

该文档未提供完整烷基机理的详细信息，也未与碳正离子机理进行比较，或解释为什么C-H活化被提议为速率决定步骤。它也没有解释烷基机理如何适用于不同的Ga物种结构。需要对丙烷脱氢机理进行更具体的研究才能完全回答这个问题。
