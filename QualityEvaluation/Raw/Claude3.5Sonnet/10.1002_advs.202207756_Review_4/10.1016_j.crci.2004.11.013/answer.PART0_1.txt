[1] "Although sodium or proton-exchanged zeolites also shows some catalytic activity in dehydrogenation reactions [6], the activity is rather low due to the high barriers associated with the generation of carbonium ions. Gallium-exchanged zeolites allow higher dehydrogenation activities [5,7]."

[2] "The details of the reaction mechanisms and the nature of the gallium active sites in these reactions are not precisely known [11,12]."

[3] "The limiting step in dehydrogenation of ethane catalyzed by a gallium-exchanged zeolite cluster model corresponds to a transition state structure that leads to the formation of ethene from ethyl chemisorbed to GaH-Z, where Z is the zeolite cluster (see TS3 in Scheme 2)."

[4] "We will check different alternatives of the reconstruction of gallium-exchanged zeolite."

[5] "It is possible to generate a Brnsted acidic site starting from a [GaH2]-zeolite structure [34]. We have checked the reconstruction in which [Ga(III)H2]-MOR evolves toward H-MOR (Figs. 1 and 2)."

The literature does not provide a comprehensive explanation of the alkyl mechanism for propane dehydrogenation on gallium-based catalysts. However, it does offer some insights into dehydrogenation reactions on gallium-exchanged zeolites:

1. Gallium-exchanged zeolites show higher dehydrogenation activity compared to sodium or proton-exchanged zeolites. This is because the latter have high barriers for generating carbonium ions.

2. The exact reaction mechanisms and nature of gallium active sites are not precisely known.

3. For ethane dehydrogenation on a gallium-exchanged zeolite cluster model, the rate-determining step involves the formation of ethene from ethyl chemisorbed to GaH-Z.

4. Various reconstructions of gallium-exchanged zeolite structures are possible, including the generation of Brønsted acidic sites from [GaH2]-zeolite structures.

5. The study focuses on different alternatives for gallium species structures in zeolites, but does not explicitly compare alkyl and carbenium mechanisms or explain why C-H activation is proposed as the rate-determining step.

Given the limited information provided in the literature about the specific alkyl mechanism for propane dehydrogenation on gallium catalysts, a comprehensive explanation of the mechanism and comparisons to the carbenium mechanism cannot be provided based solely on this document.

这篇文献并没有提供镓基催化剂上丙烷脱氢反应的烷基机理的全面解释。但是，它确实提供了一些关于镓交换沸石上脱氢反应的见解：

1. 与钠或质子交换的沸石相比，镓交换沸石表现出更高的脱氢活性。这是因为后者在产生碳正离子时存在较高的能垒。

2. 确切的反应机理和镓活性位点的性质尚未精确了解。

3. 对于镓交换沸石簇模型上的乙烷脱氢，决速步骤涉及从化学吸附在GaH-Z上的乙基形成乙烯。

4. 镓交换沸石结构可能发生各种重构，包括从[GaH2]-沸石结构生成Brønsted酸性位点。

5. 该研究关注沸石中镓物种结构的不同替代方案，但没有明确比较烷基和碳正离子机理，也没有解释为什么C-H活化被提议为决速步骤。

鉴于文献中关于镓催化剂上丙烷脱氢特定烷基机理的信息有限，仅基于这份文档无法提供该机理的全面解释，也无法与碳正离子机理进行比较。
