The provided literature does not contain specific information about the alkyl mechanism in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions on gallium-based catalysts. The text focuses on density functional theory studies of gallium-exchanged mordenite and various reconstructions of catalytic active sites, but does not discuss the detailed mechanism of propane dehydrogenation. 

The document does not provide information to compare the alkyl mechanism to the carbenium mechanism, nor does it discuss why the C-H activation step is proposed as the rate-determining step in PDH reactions. 

While the text mentions some gallium species structures like Ga(III)Hx, Ga(II)Ga(II)Hx, and Ga(III)Ga(I)Hx, it does not explain how the alkyl mechanism applies to these different structures in the context of propane dehydrogenation.

The literature primarily focuses on computational studies of gallium sites in mordenite zeolites and their potential reconstructions, rather than providing detailed mechanistic insights into propane dehydrogenation reactions.

提供的文献中没有关于镓基催化剂上丙烷脱氢(PDH)反应的烷基机理的具体信息。该文本主要关注镓交换的mordenite的密度泛函理论研究和各种催化活性位点的重构,但没有讨论丙烷脱氢的详细机理。

该文档没有提供比较烷基机理和碳正离子机理的信息,也没有讨论为什么C-H活化步骤被提出作为PDH反应的速率决定步骤。

虽然文本提到了一些镓物种结构,如Ga(III)Hx、Ga(II)Ga(II)Hx和Ga(III)Ga(I)Hx,但它没有解释烷基机理如何应用于这些不同结构的丙烷脱氢背景。

该文献主要集中在mordenite沸石中镓位点的计算研究及其潜在的重构上,而不是提供丙烷脱氢反应的详细机理见解。
