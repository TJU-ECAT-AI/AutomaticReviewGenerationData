[1] "In general, alkanes are preferentially activated via an alkyl mechanism, in which gallium acts as an acceptor of the alkyl group."

[2] "The initial step of CH activation is the oxidative addition of an alkane molecule to the Ga+ cation, which proceeds via an indirect heterolytic mechanism involving the basic oxygen atoms of the zeolite lattice."

[3] "The mechanism of ethane activation over reduced Ga cations stabilized in zeolites. Here we present a detailed comparative analysis of the reactivity of various cationic species (Ga+, GaH2+, and GaH+2) by density functional theory (DFT) cluster calculations."

[4] "The probable catalytic cycle starts with the heterolytic CH bond cleavage involving exchanged univalent gallium cation and a basic oxygen atom of the zeolite framework."

[5] "The resulting product easily rearranges to form [HGaC2H5]+, which decomposes via simultaneous desorption of H2 and C2H4, regenerating the initial Ga+ species."

The alkyl mechanism in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions on gallium-based catalysts involves several key steps:

1. Initial propane activation: This occurs through heterolytic C-H bond cleavage, involving the univalent gallium cation (Ga+) and a basic oxygen atom from the zeolite framework.

2. Oxidative addition: The alkane molecule undergoes oxidative addition to the Ga+ cation through an indirect heterolytic mechanism.

3. Formation of intermediate: The reaction produces an [HGaC3H7]+ intermediate (using propane as an example).

4. Decomposition and product formation: The intermediate decomposes, simultaneously desorbing H2 and C3H6 (propene), while regenerating the initial Ga+ species.

Comparing the alkyl mechanism to the carbenium mechanism:
The alkyl mechanism involves gallium acting as an acceptor for the alkyl group, whereas the carbenium mechanism would involve the formation of a carbocation intermediate. The alkyl mechanism is generally preferred for alkane activation on gallium-based catalysts.

The C-H activation step is likely proposed as the rate-determining step (RDS) because it involves breaking the strong C-H bond, which typically requires the highest activation energy in the overall reaction pathway.

The alkyl mechanism applies to different Ga species structures (Ga+, GaH2+, and GaH2+) in varying degrees. However, the study suggests that univalent Ga+ ions are the most probable active species for hydrocarbon dehydrogenation in high-silica zeolites. The mechanism's effectiveness may vary depending on the distribution of aluminum in the zeolite and the stability of different Ga species under reaction conditions.

在镓基催化剂上进行的丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中，烷基机理涉及几个关键步骤：

1. 初始丙烷活化：这是通过涉及一价镓阳离子（Ga+）和沸石骨架中的碱性氧原子的异裂C-H键断裂来实现的。

2. 氧化加成：烷烃分子通过间接的异裂机理对Ga+阳离子进行氧化加成。

3. 中间体形成：反应生成[HGaC3H7]+中间体（以丙烷为例）。

4. 分解和产物形成：中间体分解，同时脱附H2和C3H6（丙烯），同时再生初始Ga+物种。

将烷基机理与碳正离子机理进行比较：
烷基机理涉及镓作为烷基基团的受体，而碳正离子机理则涉及碳正离子中间体的形成。在镓基催化剂上，烷基机理通常是烷烃活化的首选机制。

C-H活化步骤可能被提出作为速率决定步骤（RDS），因为它涉及断裂强C-H键，这通常在整个反应路径中需要最高的活化能。

烷基机理适用于不同的Ga物种结构（Ga+、GaH2+和GaH2+），但程度不同。然而，研究表明，一价Ga+离子是高硅沸石中最可能的烃类脱氢活性物种。该机理的有效性可能因沸石中铝的分布和不同Ga物种在反应条件下的稳定性而异。
