The alkyl mechanism in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions on gallium-based catalysts involves several key steps:

1. Initial activation: Propane undergoes heterolytic C-H bond cleavage through interaction with the Ga+ cation and a basic oxygen atom from the zeolite lattice. This results in the formation of a Ga-alkyl species.

2. Intermediate formation: The Ga-alkyl species rearranges to form a more stable [HGaC3H7]+ intermediate.

3. Product formation: The intermediate undergoes decomposition, simultaneously releasing H2 and propene while regenerating the initial Ga+ active site.

Compared to the carbenium mechanism, the alkyl mechanism is generally more favorable for alkane activation on gallium-based catalysts. The carbenium mechanism involves the formation of a positively charged alkyl group, which is less stable and requires higher energy.

The C-H activation step is proposed as the rate-determining step (RDS) because it involves breaking the strong C-H bond and requires the highest activation energy in the overall reaction pathway. The computed activation barrier for this step is 233 kJ/mol, which is significantly higher than subsequent steps in the mechanism.

The alkyl mechanism applies to different Ga species structures, including Ga+, GaH2+, and GaH2+. However, the reactivity and stability of these species vary:

1. Ga+ ions are considered the most probable active species for hydrocarbon dehydrogenation in high-silica zeolites.
2. GaH2+ species can also activate propane through the alkyl mechanism, but they tend to decompose to Ga+ during the catalytic cycle.
3. GaH2+ ions stabilized at sites with distant framework Al atoms show higher initial activity but lower stability compared to Ga+.

The alkyl mechanism's effectiveness depends on the Lewis acidity of the Ga species and the basicity of the zeolite oxygen atoms, which work together to facilitate the heterolytic C-H bond cleavage.

镓基催化剂上丙烷脱氢(PDH)反应的烷基机理包括几个关键步骤：

1. 初始活化：丙烷通过与Ga+阳离子和沸石晶格中的碱性氧原子相互作用，发生杂化C-H键断裂。这导致形成Ga-烷基物种。

2. 中间体形成：Ga-烷基物种重排形成更稳定的[HGaC3H7]+中间体。

3. 产物形成：中间体发生分解，同时释放H2和丙烯，同时再生初始Ga+活性位点。

与碳正离子机理相比，烷基机理在镓基催化剂上通常更有利于烷烃活化。碳正离子机理涉及形成带正电荷的烷基基团，这种基团不太稳定，需要更高的能量。

C-H活化步骤被提出作为速率决定步骤(RDS)，因为它涉及断裂强C-H键，并且在整个反应路径中需要最高的活化能。这一步骤的计算活化能为233 kJ/mol，显著高于机理中后续步骤的活化能。

烷基机理适用于不同的Ga物种结构，包括Ga+、GaH2+和GaH2+。然而，这些物种的反应活性和稳定性各不相同：

1. Ga+离子被认为是高硅沸石中烃类脱氢最可能的活性物种。
2. GaH2+物种也可以通过烷基机理活化丙烷，但它们在催化循环中倾向于分解为Ga+。
3. 在远离骨架Al原子的位点上稳定的GaH2+离子显示出较高的初始活性，但与Ga+相比稳定性较低。

烷基机理的有效性取决于Ga物种的Lewis酸性和沸石氧原子的碱性，它们协同作用以促进杂化C-H键断裂。

The alkyl mechanism in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions on gallium-based catalysts involves several key steps:

1. Initial propane activation: The process begins with the heterolytic cleavage of a C-H bond in propane. This occurs through an indirect mechanism where the gallium species acts as a Lewis acid, working in conjunction with the basic oxygen atoms of the zeolite lattice.

2. Formation of an alkyl-gallium intermediate: Following C-H bond cleavage, the gallium accepts the alkyl group (propyl in this case), forming a [HGa-propyl]+ species.

3. Product formation: The final step involves the simultaneous desorption of H2 and the olefin (propene) from the alkyl-gallium intermediate, regenerating the initial gallium active site.

Compared to the carbenium mechanism, the alkyl mechanism is generally more favorable for hydrocarbon dehydrogenation over gallium-based catalysts. This preference is attributed to the lower energy barriers associated with the alkyl pathway.

The C-H activation step is often proposed as the rate-determining step (RDS) in the alkyl mechanism. This is because breaking the strong C-H bond typically requires the highest activation energy in the overall reaction pathway.

The alkyl mechanism applies to different Ga species structures, including Ga+, GaH2+, and GaH2+. However, the reactivity and stability of these species can vary depending on their specific structure and the surrounding zeolite environment. For instance, Ga+ ions are found to be the most probable active species for hydrocarbon dehydrogenation in high-silica zeolites, while GaH2+ species tend to decompose to Ga+ during the catalytic cycle.

在镓基催化剂上进行的丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应的烷基机理包括几个关键步骤：

1. 初始丙烷活化：过程始于丙烷中C-H键的异裂。这是通过一种间接机制发生的，其中镓物种作为路易斯酸，与分子筛晶格的碱性氧原子协同工作。

2. 形成烷基-镓中间体：在C-H键断裂之后，镓接受烷基基团（在这种情况下是丙基），形成[HGa-丙基]+物种。

3. 产物形成：最后一步涉及从烷基-镓中间体同时脱附H2和烯烃（丙烯），重新生成初始镓活性位点。

与碳正离子机理相比，烷基机理在镓基催化剂上进行烃类脱氢反应时通常更有利。这种偏好归因于与烷基途径相关的较低能量障碍。

C-H活化步骤通常被提出作为烷基机理中的速率决定步骤（RDS）。这是因为在整个反应途径中，断裂强C-H键通常需要最高的活化能。

烷基机理适用于不同的Ga物种结构，包括Ga+、GaH2+和GaH2+。然而，这些物种的反应性和稳定性可能会因其特定结构和周围的分子筛环境而有所不同。例如，在高硅分子筛中，Ga+离子被发现是最可能的烃类脱氢活性物种，而GaH2+物种在催化循环过程中倾向于分解成Ga+。

The alkyl mechanism in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions on gallium-based catalysts involves several key steps:

1. Initial propane activation: The process begins with heterolytic C-H bond cleavage. Gallium species act as Lewis acids, promoting this cleavage in conjunction with basic oxygen atoms from the zeolite lattice.

2. Oxidative addition: An alkane molecule undergoes oxidative addition to the Ga+ cation through an indirect heterolytic mechanism. This step involves the basic oxygen atoms of the zeolite lattice.

3. Formation of intermediate: The activation results in the formation of a gallium-alkyl hydride intermediate, such as [HGaC3H7]+ in the case of propane.

4. Dehydrogenation: The intermediate species undergoes decomposition, leading to the simultaneous desorption of H2 and the alkene (propene in PDH).

5. Catalyst regeneration: The initial Ga+ species is regenerated, closing the catalytic cycle.

The alkyl mechanism differs from the carbenium mechanism primarily in the nature of the intermediates formed. In the alkyl mechanism, a neutral or positively charged alkyl group is bound to the gallium center, while the carbenium mechanism involves the formation of a distinct carbocation intermediate.

The C-H activation step is often proposed as the rate-determining step (RDS) because it typically has the highest energy barrier in the overall reaction pathway. This step involves breaking a strong C-H bond and rearranging the electronic structure of the alkane, which requires significant energy input.

The alkyl mechanism applies to different Ga species structures, including Ga+, GaH2+, and GaH2+. However, the reactivity and stability of these species can vary depending on their local environment within the zeolite framework. For example, Ga+ ions are generally considered the most active and stable species for PDH reactions, while GaH2+ species may decompose to Ga+ during the catalytic cycle. The reactivity of GaH2+ ions is strongly influenced by the distance between aluminum atoms in the zeolite framework, with those stabilized by closely spaced aluminum atoms showing lower activity for initial C-H bond cleavage.

镓基催化剂上丙烷脱氢(PDH)反应的烷基机理包括几个关键步骤：

1. 初始丙烷活化：过程始于C-H键的异裂。镓物种作为Lewis酸，与沸石晶格中的碱性氧原子一起促进这种断裂。

2. 氧化加成：烷烃分子通过间接的异裂机制对Ga+阳离子进行氧化加成。这一步骤涉及沸石晶格的碱性氧原子。

3. 中间体形成：活化导致形成镓-烷基氢化物中间体，如丙烷情况下的[HGaC3H7]+。

4. 脱氢：中间体物种发生分解，导致H2和烯烃（PDH中的丙烯）同时脱附。

5. 催化剂再生：初始Ga+物种被再生，完成催化循环。

烷基机理与碳正离子机理的主要区别在于所形成中间体的性质。在烷基机理中，中性或带正电的烷基与镓中心结合，而碳正离子机理涉及形成独立的碳正离子中间体。

C-H活化步骤通常被提出为速率决定步骤(RDS)，因为它在整个反应路径中通常具有最高的能量障碍。这一步骤涉及断裂强C-H键并重新排列烷烃的电子结构，需要显著的能量输入。

烷基机理适用于不同的Ga物种结构，包括Ga+、GaH2+和GaH2+。然而，这些物种的反应性和稳定性可能因其在沸石框架内的局部环境而异。例如，Ga+离子通常被认为是PDH反应中最活跃和稳定的物种，而GaH2+物种可能在催化循环中分解为Ga+。GaH2+离子的反应性强烈受沸石框架中铝原子间距离的影响，由紧密排列的铝原子稳定的GaH2+离子对初始C-H键断裂的活性较低。

The alkyl mechanism in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions on gallium-based catalysts involves several key steps:

1. Initial propane activation: The process begins with the heterolytic cleavage of a C-H bond in propane. This occurs through an indirect mechanism involving both the gallium cation and a basic oxygen atom from the zeolite lattice.

2. Formation of an alkyl-gallium intermediate: As gallium acts as an acceptor for the alkyl group, an intermediate species is formed where the propyl group is bound to the gallium.

3. β-hydride elimination: This step involves the transfer of a hydrogen from the β-carbon of the propyl group to the gallium, forming a Ga-H bond and producing propene.

4. Product desorption: The propene molecule desorbs from the catalyst surface.

5. Catalyst regeneration: The final step involves the removal of hydrogen from the gallium site, typically through recombination and desorption as H2, regenerating the active Ga+ species.

Comparing this to the carbenium mechanism:

The alkyl mechanism involves the formation of a Ga-C bond, while the carbenium mechanism would involve the formation of a carbocation intermediate. The literature suggests that the alkyl mechanism is preferred for alkane activation on gallium catalysts, as evidenced by the C^δ--H^δ+ polarization observed during molecular adsorption of ethane.

The C-H activation step is often proposed as the rate-determining step (RDS) because it involves breaking the strong C-H bond, which typically requires the highest activation energy in the overall reaction pathway.

The alkyl mechanism applies to different Ga species structures as follows:

- For Ga+ sites: The mechanism proceeds as described above, with Ga+ acting as the Lewis acid site for alkane activation.
- For GaH2+ sites: These species can also activate alkanes through a similar mechanism, but they are less stable and tend to decompose to Ga+ during the reaction.
- For GaH2+ sites: While these can potentially activate alkanes, they are generally less reactive, especially when stabilized by two nearby framework aluminum atoms.

The preference for the alkyl mechanism over the carbenium mechanism is consistent across different gallium species, although the reactivity and stability of the sites may vary depending on their specific structure and the aluminum distribution in the zeolite framework.

在含镓催化剂上进行丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应的烷基机理涉及几个关键步骤：

1. 初始丙烷活化：过程始于丙烷C-H键的异裂。这是通过涉及镓阳离子和沸石晶格中的碱性氧原子的间接机制进行的。

2. 形成烷基-镓中间体：由于镓充当烷基基团的接受者，形成了一个丙基与镓结合的中间物种。

3. β-氢消除：这一步涉及丙基β-碳上的氢转移到镓上，形成Ga-H键并产生丙烯。

4. 产物脱附：丙烯分子从催化剂表面脱附。

5. 催化剂再生：最后一步涉及从镓位点移除氢，通常通过重组和以H2形式脱附来实现，从而再生活性Ga+物种。

与碳正离子机理相比：

烷基机理涉及Ga-C键的形成，而碳正离子机理则涉及碳正离子中间体的形成。文献表明，在镓催化剂上，烷基机理是烷烃活化的首选机制，这一点从乙烷分子吸附过程中观察到的C^δ--H^δ+极化可以得到证实。

C-H活化步骤通常被提出为速率决定步骤（RDS），因为它涉及打破强C-H键，这在整个反应路径中通常需要最高的活化能。

烷基机理适用于不同的Ga物种结构，具体如下：

- 对于Ga+位点：机理按上述描述进行，Ga+作为烷烃活化的Lewis酸位点。
- 对于GaH2+位点：这些物种也可以通过类似的机理活化烷烃，但它们不太稳定，在反应过程中倾向于分解为Ga+。
- 对于GaH2+位点：虽然这些位点也可能活化烷烃，但它们通常反应性较低，尤其是当被两个邻近的骨架铝原子稳定时。

在不同的镓物种中，烷基机理相对于碳正离子机理的优先性是一致的，尽管位点的反应性和稳定性可能会因其特定结构和沸石骨架中铝的分布而有所不同。

The alkyl mechanism in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions on gallium-based catalysts involves several key steps:

1. Initial propane activation: This occurs through heterolytic C-H bond cleavage, involving the univalent gallium cation (Ga+) and a basic oxygen atom from the zeolite framework.

2. Oxidative addition: The alkane molecule undergoes oxidative addition to the Ga+ cation through an indirect heterolytic mechanism.

3. Formation of intermediate: The reaction produces an [HGaC3H7]+ intermediate (using propane as an example).

4. Decomposition and product formation: The intermediate decomposes, simultaneously desorbing H2 and C3H6 (propene), while regenerating the initial Ga+ species.

Comparing the alkyl mechanism to the carbenium mechanism:
The alkyl mechanism involves gallium acting as an acceptor for the alkyl group, whereas the carbenium mechanism would involve the formation of a carbocation intermediate. The alkyl mechanism is generally preferred for alkane activation on gallium-based catalysts.

The C-H activation step is likely proposed as the rate-determining step (RDS) because it involves breaking the strong C-H bond, which typically requires the highest activation energy in the overall reaction pathway.

The alkyl mechanism applies to different Ga species structures (Ga+, GaH2+, and GaH2+) in varying degrees. However, the study suggests that univalent Ga+ ions are the most probable active species for hydrocarbon dehydrogenation in high-silica zeolites. The mechanism's effectiveness may vary depending on the distribution of aluminum in the zeolite and the stability of different Ga species under reaction conditions.
