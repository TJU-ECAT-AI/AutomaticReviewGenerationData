[1] "In general, alkanes are preferentially activated via an alkyl mechanism, in which gallium acts as an acceptor of the alkyl group."

[2] "The initial step of CH activation is the oxidative addition of an alkane molecule to the Ga+ cation, which proceeds via an indirect heterolytic mechanism involving the basic oxygen atoms of the zeolite lattice."

[3] "The catalytic cycle is closed by one-step decomposition of [HGaC2H5]+Z. It was found that simultaneous desorption of H2 and C2H4 from these species [reaction (5)] is the most favorable process."

[4] "Recently, it was shown experimentally [42,45] and theoretically [41] that the alkyl pathway of hydrocarbon dehydrogenation over zinc-exchanged zeolites is much more favorable than the carbenium pathway."

[5] "The apparent activation barrier for this process estimated within the model used is equal to 233 kJ/mol."

The alkyl mechanism in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions on gallium-based catalysts involves several key steps:

1. Initial activation: Propane undergoes heterolytic C-H bond cleavage through interaction with the Ga+ cation and a basic oxygen atom from the zeolite lattice. This results in the formation of a Ga-alkyl species.

2. Intermediate formation: The Ga-alkyl species rearranges to form a more stable [HGaC3H7]+ intermediate.

3. Product formation: The intermediate undergoes decomposition, simultaneously releasing H2 and propene while regenerating the initial Ga+ active site.

Compared to the carbenium mechanism, the alkyl mechanism is generally more favorable for alkane activation on gallium-based catalysts. The carbenium mechanism involves the formation of a positively charged alkyl group, which is less stable and requires higher energy.

The C-H activation step is proposed as the rate-determining step (RDS) because it involves breaking the strong C-H bond and requires the highest activation energy in the overall reaction pathway. The computed activation barrier for this step is 233 kJ/mol, which is significantly higher than subsequent steps in the mechanism.

The alkyl mechanism applies to different Ga species structures, including Ga+, GaH2+, and GaH2+. However, the reactivity and stability of these species vary:

1. Ga+ ions are considered the most probable active species for hydrocarbon dehydrogenation in high-silica zeolites.
2. GaH2+ species can also activate propane through the alkyl mechanism, but they tend to decompose to Ga+ during the catalytic cycle.
3. GaH2+ ions stabilized at sites with distant framework Al atoms show higher initial activity but lower stability compared to Ga+.

The alkyl mechanism's effectiveness depends on the Lewis acidity of the Ga species and the basicity of the zeolite oxygen atoms, which work together to facilitate the heterolytic C-H bond cleavage.

镓基催化剂上丙烷脱氢(PDH)反应的烷基机理包括几个关键步骤：

1. 初始活化：丙烷通过与Ga+阳离子和沸石晶格中的碱性氧原子相互作用，发生杂化C-H键断裂。这导致形成Ga-烷基物种。

2. 中间体形成：Ga-烷基物种重排形成更稳定的[HGaC3H7]+中间体。

3. 产物形成：中间体发生分解，同时释放H2和丙烯，同时再生初始Ga+活性位点。

与碳正离子机理相比，烷基机理在镓基催化剂上通常更有利于烷烃活化。碳正离子机理涉及形成带正电荷的烷基基团，这种基团不太稳定，需要更高的能量。

C-H活化步骤被提出作为速率决定步骤(RDS)，因为它涉及断裂强C-H键，并且在整个反应路径中需要最高的活化能。这一步骤的计算活化能为233 kJ/mol，显著高于机理中后续步骤的活化能。

烷基机理适用于不同的Ga物种结构，包括Ga+、GaH2+和GaH2+。然而，这些物种的反应活性和稳定性各不相同：

1. Ga+离子被认为是高硅沸石中烃类脱氢最可能的活性物种。
2. GaH2+物种也可以通过烷基机理活化丙烷，但它们在催化循环中倾向于分解为Ga+。
3. 在远离骨架Al原子的位点上稳定的GaH2+离子显示出较高的初始活性，但与Ga+相比稳定性较低。

烷基机理的有效性取决于Ga物种的Lewis酸性和沸石氧原子的碱性，它们协同作用以促进杂化C-H键断裂。
