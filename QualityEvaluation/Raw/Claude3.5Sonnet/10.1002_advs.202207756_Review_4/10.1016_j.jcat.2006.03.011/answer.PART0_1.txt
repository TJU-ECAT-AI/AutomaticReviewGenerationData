[1] "In general, alkanes are preferentially activated via an alkyl mechanism, in which gallium acts as an acceptor of the alkyl group."

[2] "The initial step of CH activation is the oxidative addition of an alkane molecule to the Ga+ cation, which proceeds via an indirect heterolytic mechanism involving the basic oxygen atoms of the zeolite lattice."

[3] "Recently, it was shown experimentally [42,45] and theoretically [41] that the alkyl pathway of hydrocarbon dehydrogenation over zinc-exchanged zeolites is much more favorable than the carbenium pathway."

[4] "It was found that at the initial step of ethane activation, all of the gallium species considered act as Lewis acids promoting heterolytic CH cleavage involving the basic oxygen atoms of the zeolite lattice."

[5] "The catalytic cycle is closed by one-step decomposition of [HGaC2H5]+Z. It was found that simultaneous desorption of H2 and C2H4 from these species [reaction (5)] is the most favorable process."

The alkyl mechanism in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions on gallium-based catalysts involves several key steps:

1. Initial propane activation: The process begins with the heterolytic cleavage of a C-H bond in propane. This occurs through an indirect mechanism where the gallium species acts as a Lewis acid, working in conjunction with the basic oxygen atoms of the zeolite lattice.

2. Formation of an alkyl-gallium intermediate: Following C-H bond cleavage, the gallium accepts the alkyl group (propyl in this case), forming a [HGa-propyl]+ species.

3. Product formation: The final step involves the simultaneous desorption of H2 and the olefin (propene) from the alkyl-gallium intermediate, regenerating the initial gallium active site.

Compared to the carbenium mechanism, the alkyl mechanism is generally more favorable for hydrocarbon dehydrogenation over gallium-based catalysts. This preference is attributed to the lower energy barriers associated with the alkyl pathway.

The C-H activation step is often proposed as the rate-determining step (RDS) in the alkyl mechanism. This is because breaking the strong C-H bond typically requires the highest activation energy in the overall reaction pathway.

The alkyl mechanism applies to different Ga species structures, including Ga+, GaH2+, and GaH2+. However, the reactivity and stability of these species can vary depending on their specific structure and the surrounding zeolite environment. For instance, Ga+ ions are found to be the most probable active species for hydrocarbon dehydrogenation in high-silica zeolites, while GaH2+ species tend to decompose to Ga+ during the catalytic cycle.

在镓基催化剂上进行的丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应的烷基机理包括几个关键步骤：

1. 初始丙烷活化：过程始于丙烷中C-H键的异裂。这是通过一种间接机制发生的，其中镓物种作为路易斯酸，与分子筛晶格的碱性氧原子协同工作。

2. 形成烷基-镓中间体：在C-H键断裂之后，镓接受烷基基团（在这种情况下是丙基），形成[HGa-丙基]+物种。

3. 产物形成：最后一步涉及从烷基-镓中间体同时脱附H2和烯烃（丙烯），重新生成初始镓活性位点。

与碳正离子机理相比，烷基机理在镓基催化剂上进行烃类脱氢反应时通常更有利。这种偏好归因于与烷基途径相关的较低能量障碍。

C-H活化步骤通常被提出作为烷基机理中的速率决定步骤（RDS）。这是因为在整个反应途径中，断裂强C-H键通常需要最高的活化能。

烷基机理适用于不同的Ga物种结构，包括Ga+、GaH2+和GaH2+。然而，这些物种的反应性和稳定性可能会因其特定结构和周围的分子筛环境而有所不同。例如，在高硅分子筛中，Ga+离子被发现是最可能的烃类脱氢活性物种，而GaH2+物种在催化循环过程中倾向于分解成Ga+。
