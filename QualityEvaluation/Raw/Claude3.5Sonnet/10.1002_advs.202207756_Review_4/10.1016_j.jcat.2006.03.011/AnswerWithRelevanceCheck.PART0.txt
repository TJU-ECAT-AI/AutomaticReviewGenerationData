          "In general, alkanes are preferentially activated via an alkyl mechanism, in which gallium acts as an acceptor of the alkyl group."

"The initial step of CH activation is the oxidative addition of an alkane molecule to the Ga+ cation, which proceeds via an indirect heterolytic mechanism involving the basic oxygen atoms of the zeolite lattice."

"The catalytic cycle is closed by one-step decomposition of [HGaC2H5]+Z. It was found that simultaneous desorption of H2 and C2H4 from these species [reaction (5)] is the most favorable process."

"Recently, it was shown experimentally [42,45] and theoretically [41] that the alkyl pathway of hydrocarbon dehydrogenation over zinc-exchanged zeolites is much more favorable than the carbenium pathway."

"The apparent activation barrier for this process estimated within the model used is equal to 233 kJ/mol."

"It was found that at the initial step of ethane activation, all of the gallium species considered act as Lewis acids promoting heterolytic CH cleavage involving the basic oxygen atoms of the zeolite lattice."

          The alkyl mechanism in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions on gallium-based catalysts involves several key steps:

1. Initial propane activation: The process begins with heterolytic C-H bond cleavage. Gallium species act as Lewis acids, promoting this cleavage in conjunction with basic oxygen atoms from the zeolite lattice.

2. Oxidative addition: An alkane molecule undergoes oxidative addition to the Ga+ cation through an indirect heterolytic mechanism involving the basic oxygen atoms of the zeolite lattice.

3. Formation of intermediate: The activation results in the formation of a gallium-alkyl hydride intermediate, such as [HGaC3H7]+ in the case of propane.

4. Dehydrogenation and product formation: The intermediate species undergoes decomposition, leading to the simultaneous desorption of H2 and the alkene (propene in PDH).

5. Catalyst regeneration: The initial Ga+ species is regenerated, closing the catalytic cycle.

Comparing this to the carbenium mechanism:
The alkyl mechanism is generally more favorable for hydrocarbon dehydrogenation over gallium-based catalysts. In the alkyl mechanism, a neutral or positively charged alkyl group is bound to the gallium center, while the carbenium mechanism involves the formation of a distinct carbocation intermediate.

The C-H activation step is often proposed as the rate-determining step (RDS) because it typically has the highest energy barrier in the overall reaction pathway. The apparent activation barrier for this process is estimated to be around 233 kJ/mol.

The alkyl mechanism applies to different Ga species structures, including Ga+, GaH2+, and GaH2+. All these gallium species act as Lewis acids promoting heterolytic CH cleavage. However, the reactivity and stability of these species can vary depending on their local environment within the zeolite framework. Ga+ ions are generally considered the most active and stable species for PDH reactions, while GaH2+ species may decompose to Ga+ during the catalytic cycle.

          镓基催化剂上丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应的烷基机理包括几个关键步骤：

1. 初始丙烷活化：过程始于C-H键的异裂。镓物种作为Lewis酸，与分子筛晶格中的碱性氧原子一起促进这种断裂。

2. 氧化加成：烷烃分子通过涉及分子筛晶格碱性氧原子的间接异裂机制对Ga+阳离子进行氧化加成。

3. 中间体形成：活化导致形成镓-烷基氢化物中间体，如丙烷情况下的[HGaC3H7]+。

4. 脱氢和产物形成：中间体物种发生分解，导致H2和烯烃（PDH中的丙烯）同时脱附。

5. 催化剂再生：初始Ga+物种被再生，完成催化循环。

与碳正离子机理相比：
烷基机理在镓基催化剂上进行烃类脱氢反应时通常更有利。在烷基机理中，中性或带正电的烷基与镓中心结合，而碳正离子机理涉及形成独立的碳正离子中间体。

C-H活化步骤通常被提出为速率决定步骤（RDS），因为它在整个反应路径中通常具有最高的能量障碍。这个过程的表观活化能估计约为233 kJ/mol。

烷基机理适用于不同的Ga物种结构，包括Ga+、GaH2+和GaH2+。所有这些镓物种都作为Lewis酸促进异裂C-H键断裂。然而，这些物种的反应性和稳定性可能因其在分子筛框架内的局部环境而异。Ga+离子通常被认为是PDH反应中最活跃和稳定的物种，而GaH2+物种可能在催化循环中分解为Ga+。
