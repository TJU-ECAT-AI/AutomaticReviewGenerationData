[1] "Generally, alkanes are preferentially activated via an alkyl mechanism, in which gallium acts as an acceptor of the alkyl group."

[2] "The initial step of CH activation is the oxidative addition of an alkane molecule to the Ga+ cation, which proceeds via an indirect heterolytic mechanism involving the basic oxygen atoms of the zeolite lattice."

[3] "In general, alkanes are activated over transition metal complexes [3739] via formation of a σ-C2H6 complex."

[4] "The mechanism of ethane activation proposed by Joshi and Thomson [22] is disputable. Those authors suggested that gallium in such species acts as a hydride ion acceptor and that the CH bond polarization follows a carbenium mechanism (Cδ+Hδ);"

[5] "However, the activated molecular adsorption of ethane, which precedes CH cleavage, results in the opposite CδHδ+ polarization."

[6] "It is obvious that subsequent dissociative adsorption of ethane should follow the alkyl mechanism leading to formation of the intermediate product [HGaC2H5]+Z."

The alkyl mechanism in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions on gallium-based catalysts involves several key steps:

1. Initial propane activation: The process begins with the heterolytic cleavage of a C-H bond in propane. This occurs through an indirect mechanism involving both the gallium cation and a basic oxygen atom from the zeolite lattice.

2. Formation of an alkyl-gallium intermediate: As gallium acts as an acceptor for the alkyl group, an intermediate species is formed where the propyl group is bound to the gallium.

3. β-hydride elimination: This step involves the transfer of a hydrogen from the β-carbon of the propyl group to the gallium, forming a Ga-H bond and producing propene.

4. Product desorption: The propene molecule desorbs from the catalyst surface.

5. Catalyst regeneration: The final step involves the removal of hydrogen from the gallium site, typically through recombination and desorption as H2, regenerating the active Ga+ species.

Comparing this to the carbenium mechanism:

The alkyl mechanism involves the formation of a Ga-C bond, while the carbenium mechanism would involve the formation of a carbocation intermediate. The literature suggests that the alkyl mechanism is preferred for alkane activation on gallium catalysts, as evidenced by the C^δ--H^δ+ polarization observed during molecular adsorption of ethane.

The C-H activation step is often proposed as the rate-determining step (RDS) because it involves breaking the strong C-H bond, which typically requires the highest activation energy in the overall reaction pathway.

The alkyl mechanism applies to different Ga species structures as follows:

- For Ga+ sites: The mechanism proceeds as described above, with Ga+ acting as the Lewis acid site for alkane activation.
- For GaH2+ sites: These species can also activate alkanes through a similar mechanism, but they are less stable and tend to decompose to Ga+ during the reaction.
- For GaH2+ sites: While these can potentially activate alkanes, they are generally less reactive, especially when stabilized by two nearby framework aluminum atoms.

The preference for the alkyl mechanism over the carbenium mechanism is consistent across different gallium species, although the reactivity and stability of the sites may vary depending on their specific structure and the aluminum distribution in the zeolite framework.

在含镓催化剂上进行丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应的烷基机理涉及几个关键步骤：

1. 初始丙烷活化：过程始于丙烷C-H键的异裂。这是通过涉及镓阳离子和沸石晶格中的碱性氧原子的间接机制进行的。

2. 形成烷基-镓中间体：由于镓充当烷基基团的接受者，形成了一个丙基与镓结合的中间物种。

3. β-氢消除：这一步涉及丙基β-碳上的氢转移到镓上，形成Ga-H键并产生丙烯。

4. 产物脱附：丙烯分子从催化剂表面脱附。

5. 催化剂再生：最后一步涉及从镓位点移除氢，通常通过重组和以H2形式脱附来实现，从而再生活性Ga+物种。

与碳正离子机理相比：

烷基机理涉及Ga-C键的形成，而碳正离子机理则涉及碳正离子中间体的形成。文献表明，在镓催化剂上，烷基机理是烷烃活化的首选机制，这一点从乙烷分子吸附过程中观察到的C^δ--H^δ+极化可以得到证实。

C-H活化步骤通常被提出为速率决定步骤（RDS），因为它涉及打破强C-H键，这在整个反应路径中通常需要最高的活化能。

烷基机理适用于不同的Ga物种结构，具体如下：

- 对于Ga+位点：机理按上述描述进行，Ga+作为烷烃活化的Lewis酸位点。
- 对于GaH2+位点：这些物种也可以通过类似的机理活化烷烃，但它们不太稳定，在反应过程中倾向于分解为Ga+。
- 对于GaH2+位点：虽然这些位点也可能活化烷烃，但它们通常反应性较低，尤其是当被两个邻近的骨架铝原子稳定时。

在不同的镓物种中，烷基机理相对于碳正离子机理的优先性是一致的，尽管位点的反应性和稳定性可能会因其特定结构和沸石骨架中铝的分布而有所不同。
