The provided literature does not contain information about the alkyl mechanism in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions on gallium-based catalysts. The document appears to be about chabazite zeolites and their structure-directing agents, which is unrelated to the question asked. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to the question based on this literature.

所提供的文献不包含关于镓基催化剂上丙烷脱氢(PDH)反应中烷基机理的信息。该文档似乎是关于方沸石及其结构导向剂的内容，与所问的问题无关。因此，我无法根据这篇文献回答这个问题。
