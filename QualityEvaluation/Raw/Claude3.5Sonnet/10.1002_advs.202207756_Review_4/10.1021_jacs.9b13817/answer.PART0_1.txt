The provided literature does not contain information about the alkyl mechanism in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions on gallium-based catalysts. The article appears to be about chabazite zeolites and their structure-directing agents, which is unrelated to the question asked. Therefore, I cannot provide a comprehensive explanation of the alkyl mechanism, compare it to the carbenium mechanism, discuss the CH activation step as the rate-determining step, or explain how the alkyl mechanism applies to different Ga species structures based on the given information.

提供的文献不包含关于镓基催化剂上丙烷脱氢(PDH)反应的烷基机理的信息。这篇文章似乎是关于chabazite沸石及其结构导向剂的，与所问的问题无关。因此，我无法基于给定的信息提供烷基机理的全面解释，将其与碳正离子机理进行比较，讨论CH活化步骤作为速率决定步骤，或解释烷基机理如何适用于不同的镓物种结构。
