[1] "Similar to the carbenium mechanism, the alkyl mechanism could be at play regardless of the specific structure of active Ga species, on which propane is initially activated by the metal cation to form the alkyl gallium intermediate, followed by the β-elimination and the desorption of propylene and H2."

[2] "The CH activation step and the formation of an alkyl metal intermediate were proposed as the RDS, as shown in Scheme 2."

[3] "The key difference between the two mechanisms is the role of Ga species in PDH: facilitate the recombination of H adatoms to release H2 versus activate the CH bond in propane."

[4] "Another potentially experimentally verifiable difference between mechanisms is the formation of an alkyl metal intermediate, Ga-C3H7, whose CH stretching bands in IR spectroscopy are expected to be different from those in C3H7+."

[5] "Since the distribution of different Ga species is impacted by both Ga loading and Al distribution in H-ZSM-5, it is possible that the carbenium or alkyl mechanism is dominant on Ga/H-ZSM-5 with different densities of Ga species."

The alkyl mechanism in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions on gallium-based catalysts involves several key steps:

1. Initial activation: Propane is activated by the metal cation (Ga species).
2. Intermediate formation: An alkyl gallium intermediate (Ga-C3H7) is formed.
3. β-elimination: This step leads to the breaking of a C-H bond.
4. Product formation: Propylene and H2 are formed and desorb from the catalyst surface.

The CH activation step and the formation of the alkyl metal intermediate are proposed as the rate-determining step (RDS) in this mechanism.

Comparing the alkyl mechanism to the carbenium mechanism, the key difference lies in the role of Ga species:
- Alkyl mechanism: Ga activates the C-H bond in propane
- Carbenium mechanism: Ga facilitates the recombination of H adatoms to release H2

The alkyl mechanism can apply to different Ga species structures, regardless of their specific form. However, the dominance of either the carbenium or alkyl mechanism may depend on the densities of different Ga species, which are influenced by Ga loading and Al distribution in H-ZSM-5.

One way to experimentally verify the alkyl mechanism is through IR spectroscopy, as the CH stretching bands of the Ga-C3H7 intermediate are expected to differ from those of C3H7+ (carbenium ion).

The CH activation step is proposed as the RDS because it involves breaking a strong C-H bond, which is typically energetically demanding. This step determines the overall rate of the reaction and is crucial for the formation of the alkyl gallium intermediate.

在基于镓的催化剂上进行的丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中，烷基机理涉及几个关键步骤：

1. 初始活化：丙烷被金属阳离子（镓物种）活化。
2. 中间体形成：形成烷基镓中间体（Ga-C3H7）。
3. β-消除：这一步导致C-H键的断裂。
4. 产物形成：形成丙烯和H2，并从催化剂表面脱附。

C-H活化步骤和烷基金属中间体的形成被提出作为该机理的速率决定步骤（RDS）。

将烷基机理与碳正离子机理进行比较，关键区别在于镓物种的作用：
- 烷基机理：镓活化丙烷中的C-H键
- 碳正离子机理：镓促进H原子的重组以释放H2

烷基机理可以适用于不同的镓物种结构，无论其具体形式如何。然而，碳正离子或烷基机理的主导性可能取决于不同镓物种的密度，这受到镓负载量和H-ZSM-5中铝分布的影响。

通过红外光谱可以实验性地验证烷基机理，因为Ga-C3H7中间体的C-H伸缩振动带预计与C3H7+（碳正离子）的不同。

C-H活化步骤被提出为RDS，因为它涉及断裂强C-H键，这通常需要较高的能量。这一步骤决定了整个反应的速率，对于烷基镓中间体的形成至关重要。
