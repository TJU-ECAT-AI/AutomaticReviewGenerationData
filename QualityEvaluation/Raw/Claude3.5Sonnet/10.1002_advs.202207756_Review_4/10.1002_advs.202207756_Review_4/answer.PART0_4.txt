[1] "Similar to the carbenium mechanism, the alkyl mechanism could be at play regardless of the specific structure of active Ga species, on which propane is initially activated by the metal cation to form the alkyl gallium intermediate, followed by the β-elimination and the desorption of propylene and H2."

[2] "The CH activation step and the formation of an alkyl metal intermediate were proposed as the RDS, as shown in Scheme 2."

[3] "The key difference between the two mechanisms is the role of Ga species in PDH: facilitate the recombination of H adatoms to release H2 versus activate the CH bond in propane."

[4] "Schreiber et al. compared propane activation over BAS (H+), Ga+, and Ga+H+ pair, and found both H+ and Ga+ show a higher activation energy of propane than the Ga+H+ pair.[77] The Ga+H+ pair is likely to catalyze PDH via the alkyl pathway."

[5] "For [GaH2]+, the stepwise alkyl pathway is more favorable, with C-H activation being the RDS. For the [GaH]2+, ethene formation is the RDS when the reaction proceeds via the alkyl pathway, however, the carbenium pathway is slightly more favorable with a similar ethene formation and CH activation energy."

The alkyl mechanism in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions on gallium-based catalysts involves several key steps:

1. Initial activation: Propane is activated by the gallium metal cation.
2. Intermediate formation: An alkyl gallium intermediate is formed.
3. β-elimination: This process occurs following the intermediate formation.
4. Product formation: Propylene and H2 desorb from the catalyst surface.

The CH activation step and the formation of the alkyl metal intermediate are proposed as the rate-determining step (RDS) in this mechanism.

Comparing the alkyl mechanism to the carbenium mechanism, the primary difference lies in the role of Ga species. In the alkyl mechanism, Ga activates the CH bond in propane, while in the carbenium mechanism, it facilitates the recombination of H adatoms to release H2.

The CH activation step is proposed as the RDS because it involves breaking a strong carbon-hydrogen bond, which is typically energy-intensive and slower compared to other steps in the reaction.

The alkyl mechanism applies to different Ga species structures, including Ga+, [GaH2]+, and [GaH]2+. However, the favorability and specific details of the mechanism can vary depending on the Ga species. For instance:

- The Ga+H+ pair is likely to catalyze PDH via the alkyl pathway.
- For [GaH2]+, the stepwise alkyl pathway is more favorable, with C-H activation being the RDS.
- For [GaH]2+, the situation is more complex. When following the alkyl pathway, ethene formation becomes the RDS. However, the carbenium pathway is slightly more favorable for this species, with similar energy barriers for ethene formation and CH activation.

These variations highlight the complexity of the PDH reaction on gallium-based catalysts and the importance of considering the specific Ga species present when studying the reaction mechanism.

在镓基催化剂上进行的丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中，烷基机理涉及以下几个关键步骤：

1. 初始活化：丙烷被镓金属阳离子活化。
2. 中间体形成：形成烷基镓中间体。
3. β-消除：这个过程在中间体形成后发生。
4. 产物形成：丙烯和H2从催化剂表面脱附。

CH活化步骤和烷基金属中间体的形成被提出作为该机理的速率决定步骤（RDS）。

比较烷基机理和碳正离子机理，主要区别在于Ga物种的作用。在烷基机理中，Ga活化丙烷中的CH键，而在碳正离子机理中，它促进H原子的重组以释放H2。

CH活化步骤被提出为RDS，因为它涉及打断强碳氢键，这通常需要较高的能量且比反应中的其他步骤更慢。

烷基机理适用于不同的Ga物种结构，包括Ga+、[GaH2]+和[GaH]2+。然而，机理的优势性和具体细节可能因Ga物种而异。例如：

- Ga+H+对可能通过烷基途径催化PDH。
- 对于[GaH2]+，逐步烷基途径更有利，C-H活化是RDS。
- 对于[GaH]2+，情况更为复杂。当遵循烷基途径时，乙烯形成成为RDS。然而，对于这种物种，碳正离子途径略有优势，乙烯形成和CH活化的能量障碍相似。

这些变化突显了镓基催化剂上PDH反应的复杂性，以及在研究反应机理时考虑存在的特定Ga物种的重要性。
