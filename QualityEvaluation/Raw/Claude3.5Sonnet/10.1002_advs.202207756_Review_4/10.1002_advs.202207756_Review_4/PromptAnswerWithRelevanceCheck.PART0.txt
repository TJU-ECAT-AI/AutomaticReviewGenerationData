[1] "Similar to the carbenium mechanism, the alkyl mechanism could be at play regardless of the specific structure of active Ga species, on which propane is initially activated by the metal cation to form the alkyl gallium intermediate, followed by the β-elimination and the desorption of propylene and H2."

[2] "The CH activation step and the formation of an alkyl metal intermediate were proposed as the RDS, as shown in Scheme 2."

[3] "The key difference between the two mechanisms is the role of Ga species in PDH: facilitate the recombination of H adatoms to release H2 versus activate the CH bond in propane."

[4] "Another potentially experimentally verifiable difference between mechanisms is the formation of an alkyl metal intermediate, Ga-C3H7, whose CH stretching bands in IR spectroscopy are expected to be different from those in C3H7+."

[5] "Since the distribution of different Ga species is impacted by both Ga loading and Al distribution in H-ZSM-5, it is possible that the carbenium or alkyl mechanism is dominant on Ga/H-ZSM-5 with different densities of Ga species."

The alkyl mechanism in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions on gallium-based catalysts involves several key steps:

1. Initial activation: Propane is activated by the metal cation (Ga species).
2. Intermediate formation: An alkyl gallium intermediate (Ga-C3H7) is formed.
3. β-elimination: This step leads to the breaking of a C-H bond.
4. Product formation: Propylene and H2 are formed and desorb from the catalyst surface.

The CH activation step and the formation of the alkyl metal intermediate are proposed as the rate-determining step (RDS) in this mechanism.

Comparing the alkyl mechanism to the carbenium mechanism, the key difference lies in the role of Ga species:
- Alkyl mechanism: Ga activates the C-H bond in propane
- Carbenium mechanism: Ga facilitates the recombination of H adatoms to release H2

The alkyl mechanism can apply to different Ga species structures, regardless of their specific form. However, the dominance of either the carbenium or alkyl mechanism may depend on the densities of different Ga species, which are influenced by Ga loading and Al distribution in H-ZSM-5.

One way to experimentally verify the alkyl mechanism is through IR spectroscopy, as the CH stretching bands of the Ga-C3H7 intermediate are expected to differ from those of C3H7+ (carbenium ion).

The CH activation step is proposed as the RDS because it involves breaking a strong C-H bond, which is typically energetically demanding. This step determines the overall rate of the reaction and is crucial for the formation of the alkyl gallium intermediate.

在基于镓的催化剂上进行的丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中，烷基机理涉及几个关键步骤：

1. 初始活化：丙烷被金属阳离子（镓物种）活化。
2. 中间体形成：形成烷基镓中间体（Ga-C3H7）。
3. β-消除：这一步导致C-H键的断裂。
4. 产物形成：形成丙烯和H2，并从催化剂表面脱附。

C-H活化步骤和烷基金属中间体的形成被提出作为该机理的速率决定步骤（RDS）。

将烷基机理与碳正离子机理进行比较，关键区别在于镓物种的作用：
- 烷基机理：镓活化丙烷中的C-H键
- 碳正离子机理：镓促进H原子的重组以释放H2

烷基机理可以适用于不同的镓物种结构，无论其具体形式如何。然而，碳正离子或烷基机理的主导性可能取决于不同镓物种的密度，这受到镓负载量和H-ZSM-5中铝分布的影响。

通过红外光谱可以实验性地验证烷基机理，因为Ga-C3H7中间体的C-H伸缩振动带预计与C3H7+（碳正离子）的不同。

C-H活化步骤被提出为RDS，因为它涉及断裂强C-H键，这通常需要较高的能量。这一步骤决定了整个反应的速率，对于烷基镓中间体的形成至关重要。

The alkyl mechanism in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions on gallium-based catalysts involves several key steps:

1. Initial activation: Propane is activated by the metal cation (Ga species) to form an alkyl gallium intermediate (Ga-C3H7).

2. C-H bond activation: This step is proposed as the rate-determining step (RDS) in the alkyl mechanism.

3. β-elimination: Following the C-H activation, β-elimination occurs.

4. Product formation: Propylene and H2 are formed and desorb from the catalyst surface.

The alkyl mechanism differs from the carbenium mechanism primarily in the role of Ga species. In the alkyl mechanism, Ga activates the C-H bond in propane, while in the carbenium mechanism, Ga facilitates the recombination of H adatoms to release H2.

The C-H activation step is proposed as the RDS because it involves breaking a strong bond and forming the alkyl metal intermediate, which is energetically demanding. This step is crucial for the overall reaction progress and likely determines the reaction rate.

The alkyl mechanism applies to different Ga species structures, including Ga+, [GaH]+, and Ga2O22+. However, the favorability and specific details of the mechanism may vary depending on the Ga species. For example, for [GaH2]+, the stepwise alkyl pathway is more favorable with C-H activation as the RDS, while for [GaH]2+, the RDS in the alkyl pathway is ethene formation.

The formation of the alkyl metal intermediate (Ga-C3H7) is a key characteristic of the alkyl mechanism and can be potentially verified experimentally through IR spectroscopy, as its CH stretching bands are expected to differ from those of C3H7+ in the carbenium mechanism.

It's worth noting that both the alkyl and carbenium mechanisms may coexist, with their relative dominance potentially depending on the specific Ga species present and the reaction conditions.

3. β-消除：在C-H活化之后，发生β-消除。

4. 产物形成：丙烯和H2形成并从催化剂表面脱附。

烷基机理与碳正离子机理的主要区别在于镓物种的作用。在烷基机理中，镓活化丙烷中的C-H键，而在碳正离子机理中，镓促进H原子的重组以释放H2。

C-H活化步骤被提议为RDS，因为它涉及打破强键和形成烷基金属中间体，这在能量上是要求很高的。这一步骤对整个反应进程至关重要，可能决定了反应速率。

烷基机理适用于不同的镓物种结构，包括Ga+、[GaH]+和Ga2O22+。然而，机理的优势性和具体细节可能因镓物种而异。例如，对于[GaH2]+，逐步烷基途径更有利，C-H活化是RDS；而对于[GaH]2+，烷基途径中的RDS是乙烯形成。

烷基金属中间体（Ga-C3H7）的形成是烷基机理的一个关键特征，可以通过红外光谱进行实验验证，因为其CH伸缩振动带预计与碳正离子机理中的C3H7+不同。

值得注意的是，烷基和碳正离子机理可能共存，它们的相对主导地位可能取决于存在的具体镓物种和反应条件。

2. Intermediate formation: An alkyl gallium intermediate (Ga-C3H7) is formed.
3. β-elimination: This step leads to the formation of propylene.
4. Product desorption: Propylene and H2 are desorbed from the catalyst surface.

The CH activation step and the formation of the alkyl metal intermediate are proposed as the rate-determining step (RDS) in this mechanism.

Comparing the alkyl mechanism to the carbenium mechanism:

- The main difference lies in the role of Ga species in PDH:
  - Alkyl mechanism: Ga activates the CH bond in propane
  - Carbenium mechanism: Ga facilitates the recombination of H adatoms to release H2

- The alkyl mechanism involves the formation of a Ga-C3H7 intermediate, while the carbenium mechanism forms a C3H7+ species.

- These intermediates can be distinguished experimentally through their different CH stretching bands in IR spectroscopy.

The CH activation step is proposed as the RDS because it involves breaking a strong carbon-hydrogen bond, which is typically energy-intensive and likely to be the slowest step in the overall reaction.

The alkyl mechanism can apply to different Ga species structures, including Ga+, [GaH]+, and Ga2O22+. However, the specific pathway and energetics may vary depending on the Ga species involved. It's important to note that both the carbenium and alkyl mechanisms might be occurring simultaneously on different types of Ga sites within the catalyst.

The alkyl mechanism in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions on gallium-based catalysts involves several key steps:

1. Initial activation: Propane is activated by the gallium metal cation.
2. Intermediate formation: An alkyl gallium intermediate (Ga-C3H7) is formed.
3. β-elimination: The intermediate undergoes β-elimination.
4. Product formation: Propylene and H2 are desorbed as products.

The alkyl mechanism differs from the carbenium mechanism primarily in the role of Ga species. In the alkyl mechanism, Ga activates the C-H bond in propane, while in the carbenium mechanism, it facilitates the recombination of H adatoms to release H2.

The C-H activation step and the formation of the alkyl metal intermediate are proposed as the rate-determining step (RDS) in the alkyl mechanism. This is likely due to the energy required to break the strong C-H bond in propane.

The alkyl mechanism can apply to different Ga species structures, including Ga+, [GaH]+, and Ga2O22+. However, the dominant mechanism (alkyl or carbenium) may vary depending on the specific Ga species present, which is influenced by factors such as Ga loading and Al distribution in the H-ZSM-5 support.

The formation of the Ga-C3H7 intermediate is a key distinguishing feature of the alkyl mechanism, which can be potentially verified experimentally through IR spectroscopy. The CH stretching bands of this intermediate are expected to differ from those of the C3H7+ species formed in the carbenium mechanism.

Overall, the alkyl mechanism provides an alternative pathway for PDH reactions on gallium-based catalysts, with the potential to be dominant under certain conditions and for specific Ga species structures.

- For [GaH2]+, the stepwise alkyl pathway is more favorable, with C-H activation being the RDS.
- For [GaH]2+, the situation is more complex. When following the alkyl pathway, ethene formation becomes the RDS. However, the carbenium pathway is slightly more favorable for this species, with similar energy barriers for ethene formation and CH activation.

These variations highlight the complexity of the PDH reaction on gallium-based catalysts and the importance of considering the specific Ga species present when studying the reaction mechanism.
