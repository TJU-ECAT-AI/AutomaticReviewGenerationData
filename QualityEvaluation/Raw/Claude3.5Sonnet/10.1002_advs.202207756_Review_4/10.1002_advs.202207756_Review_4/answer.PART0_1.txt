[1] "Similar to the carbenium mechanism, the alkyl mechanism could be at play regardless of the specific structure of active Ga species, on which propane is initially activated by the metal cation to form the alkyl gallium intermediate, followed by the β-elimination and the desorption of propylene and H2."

[2] "The CH activation step and the formation of an alkyl metal intermediate were proposed as the RDS, as shown in Scheme 2."

[3] "The key difference between the two mechanisms is the role of Ga species in PDH: facilitate the recombination of H adatoms to release H2 versus activate the CH bond in propane."

[4] "Another potentially experimentally verifiable difference between mechanisms is the formation of an alkyl metal intermediate, Ga-C3H7, whose CH stretching bands in IR spectroscopy are expected to be different from those in C3H7+."

[5] "For [GaH2]+, the stepwise alkyl pathway is more favorable, with C-H activation being the RDS. For the [GaH]2+, ethene formation is the RDS when the reaction proceeds via the alkyl pathway, however, the carbenium pathway is slightly more favorable with a similar ethene formation and CH activation energy."

The alkyl mechanism in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions on gallium-based catalysts involves several key steps:

1. Initial activation: Propane is activated by the metal cation (Ga species) to form an alkyl gallium intermediate (Ga-C3H7).

2. C-H bond activation: This step is proposed as the rate-determining step (RDS) in the alkyl mechanism.

3. β-elimination: Following the C-H activation, β-elimination occurs.

4. Product formation: Propylene and H2 are formed and desorb from the catalyst surface.

The alkyl mechanism differs from the carbenium mechanism primarily in the role of Ga species. In the alkyl mechanism, Ga activates the C-H bond in propane, while in the carbenium mechanism, Ga facilitates the recombination of H adatoms to release H2.

The C-H activation step is proposed as the RDS because it involves breaking a strong bond and forming the alkyl metal intermediate, which is energetically demanding. This step is crucial for the overall reaction progress and likely determines the reaction rate.

The alkyl mechanism applies to different Ga species structures, including Ga+, [GaH]+, and Ga2O22+. However, the favorability and specific details of the mechanism may vary depending on the Ga species. For example, for [GaH2]+, the stepwise alkyl pathway is more favorable with C-H activation as the RDS, while for [GaH]2+, the RDS in the alkyl pathway is ethene formation.

The formation of the alkyl metal intermediate (Ga-C3H7) is a key characteristic of the alkyl mechanism and can be potentially verified experimentally through IR spectroscopy, as its CH stretching bands are expected to differ from those of C3H7+ in the carbenium mechanism.

It's worth noting that both the alkyl and carbenium mechanisms may coexist, with their relative dominance potentially depending on the specific Ga species present and the reaction conditions.

在镓基催化剂上的丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中，烷基机理涉及几个关键步骤：

1. 初始活化：丙烷被金属阳离子（镓物种）活化，形成烷基镓中间体（Ga-C3H7）。

2. C-H键活化：这一步骤被提议为烷基机理中的速率决定步骤（RDS）。

3. β-消除：在C-H活化之后，发生β-消除。

4. 产物形成：丙烯和H2形成并从催化剂表面脱附。

烷基机理与碳正离子机理的主要区别在于镓物种的作用。在烷基机理中，镓活化丙烷中的C-H键，而在碳正离子机理中，镓促进H原子的重组以释放H2。

C-H活化步骤被提议为RDS，因为它涉及打破强键和形成烷基金属中间体，这在能量上是要求很高的。这一步骤对整个反应进程至关重要，可能决定了反应速率。

烷基机理适用于不同的镓物种结构，包括Ga+、[GaH]+和Ga2O22+。然而，机理的优势性和具体细节可能因镓物种而异。例如，对于[GaH2]+，逐步烷基途径更有利，C-H活化是RDS；而对于[GaH]2+，烷基途径中的RDS是乙烯形成。

烷基金属中间体（Ga-C3H7）的形成是烷基机理的一个关键特征，可以通过红外光谱进行实验验证，因为其CH伸缩振动带预计与碳正离子机理中的C3H7+不同。

值得注意的是，烷基和碳正离子机理可能共存，它们的相对主导地位可能取决于存在的具体镓物种和反应条件。
