[1] "Similar to the carbenium mechanism, the alkyl mechanism could be at play regardless of the specific structure of active Ga species, on which propane is initially activated by the metal cation to form the alkyl gallium intermediate, followed by the β-elimination and the desorption of propylene and H2."

[2] "The CH activation step and the formation of an alkyl metal intermediate were proposed as the RDS, as shown in Scheme 2."

[3] "The key difference between the two mechanisms is the role of Ga species in PDH: facilitate the recombination of H adatoms to release H2 versus activate the CH bond in propane."

[4] "Another potentially experimentally verifiable difference between mechanisms is the formation of an alkyl metal intermediate, Ga-C3H7, whose CH stretching bands in IR spectroscopy are expected to be different from those in C3H7+."

[5] "Thus, PDH could occur via different mechanisms on different types of Ga sites. Since the distribution of different Ga species is impacted by both Ga loading and Al distribution in H-ZSM-5, it is possible that the carbenium or alkyl mechanism is dominant on Ga/H-ZSM-5 with different densities of Ga species."

The alkyl mechanism in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions on gallium-based catalysts involves several key steps:

1. Initial activation: Propane is activated by the gallium metal cation.
2. Intermediate formation: An alkyl gallium intermediate (Ga-C3H7) is formed.
3. β-elimination: The intermediate undergoes β-elimination.
4. Product formation: Propylene and H2 are desorbed as products.

The alkyl mechanism differs from the carbenium mechanism primarily in the role of Ga species. In the alkyl mechanism, Ga activates the C-H bond in propane, while in the carbenium mechanism, it facilitates the recombination of H adatoms to release H2.

The C-H activation step and the formation of the alkyl metal intermediate are proposed as the rate-determining step (RDS) in the alkyl mechanism. This is likely due to the energy required to break the strong C-H bond in propane.

The alkyl mechanism can apply to different Ga species structures, including Ga+, [GaH]+, and Ga2O22+. However, the dominant mechanism (alkyl or carbenium) may vary depending on the specific Ga species present, which is influenced by factors such as Ga loading and Al distribution in the H-ZSM-5 support.

The formation of the Ga-C3H7 intermediate is a key distinguishing feature of the alkyl mechanism, which can be potentially verified experimentally through IR spectroscopy. The CH stretching bands of this intermediate are expected to differ from those of the C3H7+ species formed in the carbenium mechanism.

Overall, the alkyl mechanism provides an alternative pathway for PDH reactions on gallium-based catalysts, with the potential to be dominant under certain conditions and for specific Ga species structures.

镓基催化剂上丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应的烷基机理涉及几个关键步骤：

1. 初始活化：丙烷被镓金属阳离子活化。
2. 中间体形成：形成烷基镓中间体（Ga-C3H7）。
3. β-消除：中间体发生β-消除。
4. 产物形成：丙烯和H2作为产物解吸。

烷基机理与羰基机理的主要区别在于镓物种的作用。在烷基机理中，镓活化丙烷中的C-H键，而在羰基机理中，镓促进H原子的重组以释放H2。

C-H活化步骤和烷基金属中间体的形成被提出作为烷基机理的速率决定步骤（RDS）。这很可能是由于断裂丙烷中强C-H键所需的能量。

烷基机理可以适用于不同的镓物种结构，包括Ga+、[GaH]+和Ga2O22+。然而，主导机理（烷基或羰基）可能因存在的特定镓物种而异，这受到诸如镓负载量和H-ZSM-5支持体中Al分布等因素的影响。

Ga-C3H7中间体的形成是烷基机理的一个关键区别特征，可以通过IR光谱实验进行潜在验证。这种中间体的CH伸缩振动带预计与羰基机理中形成的C3H7+物种不同。

总的来说，烷基机理为镓基催化剂上的PDH反应提供了一种替代途径，在某些条件下和特定镓物种结构中可能占主导地位。
