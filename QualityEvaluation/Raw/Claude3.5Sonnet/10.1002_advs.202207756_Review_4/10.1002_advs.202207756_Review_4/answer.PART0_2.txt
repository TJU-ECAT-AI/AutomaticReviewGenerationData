[1] "Similar to the carbenium mechanism, the alkyl mechanism could be at play regardless of the specific structure of active Ga species, on which propane is initially activated by the metal cation to form the alkyl gallium intermediate, followed by the β-elimination and the desorption of propylene and H2."

[2] "The CH activation step and the formation of an alkyl metal intermediate were proposed as the RDS, as shown in Scheme 2."

[3] "The key difference between the two mechanisms is the role of Ga species in PDH: facilitate the recombination of H adatoms to release H2 versus activate the CH bond in propane."

[4] "Another potentially experimentally verifiable difference between mechanisms is the formation of an alkyl metal intermediate, Ga-C3H7, whose CH stretching bands in IR spectroscopy are expected to be different from those in C3H7+."

[5] "The possibility that both Ga-C3H7 and C3H7+ are present and in turn, both the carbenium and the alkyl mechanisms are at play, cannot be ruled out. Thus, PDH could occur via different mechanisms on different types of Ga sites."

The alkyl mechanism in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions on gallium-based catalysts involves several key steps:

1. Initial activation: Propane is activated by the metal cation (Ga species).
2. Intermediate formation: An alkyl gallium intermediate (Ga-C3H7) is formed.
3. β-elimination: This step leads to the formation of propylene.
4. Product desorption: Propylene and H2 are desorbed from the catalyst surface.

The CH activation step and the formation of the alkyl metal intermediate are proposed as the rate-determining step (RDS) in this mechanism.

Comparing the alkyl mechanism to the carbenium mechanism:

- The main difference lies in the role of Ga species in PDH:
  - Alkyl mechanism: Ga activates the CH bond in propane
  - Carbenium mechanism: Ga facilitates the recombination of H adatoms to release H2

- The alkyl mechanism involves the formation of a Ga-C3H7 intermediate, while the carbenium mechanism forms a C3H7+ species.

- These intermediates can be distinguished experimentally through their different CH stretching bands in IR spectroscopy.

The CH activation step is proposed as the RDS because it involves breaking a strong carbon-hydrogen bond, which is typically energy-intensive and likely to be the slowest step in the overall reaction.

The alkyl mechanism can apply to different Ga species structures, including Ga+, [GaH]+, and Ga2O22+. However, the specific pathway and energetics may vary depending on the Ga species involved. It's important to note that both the carbenium and alkyl mechanisms might be occurring simultaneously on different types of Ga sites within the catalyst.

在基于镓的催化剂上进行的丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中，烷基机制包括几个关键步骤：

1. 初始活化：丙烷被金属阳离子（镓物种）活化。
2. 中间体形成：形成烷基镓中间体（Ga-C3H7）。
3. β-消除：这一步骤导致丙烯的形成。
4. 产物脱附：丙烯和H2从催化剂表面脱附。

CH活化步骤和烷基金属中间体的形成被提出作为该机制的速率决定步骤（RDS）。

将烷基机制与碳正离子机制进行比较：

- 主要区别在于镓物种在PDH中的作用：
  - 烷基机制：镓活化丙烷中的CH键
  - 碳正离子机制：镓促进H原子的重组以释放H2

- 烷基机制涉及Ga-C3H7中间体的形成，而碳正离子机制形成C3H7+物种。

- 这些中间体可以通过IR光谱中不同的CH伸缩带进行实验区分。

CH活化步骤被提出为RDS，因为它涉及打断强碳-氢键，这通常需要高能量，可能是整个反应中最慢的步骤。

烷基机制可以适用于不同的镓物种结构，包括Ga+、[GaH]+和Ga2O22+。然而，具体的反应路径和能量学可能会因涉及的镓物种而异。需要注意的是，碳正离子机制和烷基机制可能同时在催化剂中不同类型的镓位点上发生。
