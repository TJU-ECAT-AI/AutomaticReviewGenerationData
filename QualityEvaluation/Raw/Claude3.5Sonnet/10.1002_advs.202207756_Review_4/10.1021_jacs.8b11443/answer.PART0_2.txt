I apologize, but I cannot provide a comprehensive explanation of the alkyl mechanism in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions on gallium-based catalysts based on the given literature. The provided text does not contain any information about reaction mechanisms, key steps, or comparisons between different mechanisms. It only includes the title, authors, and publication details of a scientific article. Without access to the full text or additional information, I cannot accurately answer the question or discuss the alkyl mechanism, carbenium mechanism, rate-determining steps, or how the mechanism applies to different Ga species structures.

我很抱歉，但我无法根据给定的文献对镓基催化剂上丙烷脱氢(PDH)反应的烷基机理提供全面的解释。提供的文本不包含任何关于反应机理、关键步骤或不同机理之间比较的信息。它只包括一篇科学文章的标题、作者和出版细节。没有获得全文或额外信息的情况下，我无法准确回答这个问题，也无法讨论烷基机理、碳正离子机理、速率决定步骤，或者该机理如何适用于不同的镓物种结构。
