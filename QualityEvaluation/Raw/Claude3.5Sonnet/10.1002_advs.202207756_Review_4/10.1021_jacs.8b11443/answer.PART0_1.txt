Unfortunately, I cannot provide a comprehensive explanation of the alkyl mechanism in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions on gallium-based catalysts or compare it to the carbenium mechanism based on the given literature excerpt. The provided text appears to be only a title and author information for a scientific article, without any detailed content about reaction mechanisms. To accurately answer this question, I would need access to the full text of the article or additional relevant literature on the topic.

很遗憾，我无法根据给出的文献摘录对镓基催化剂上丙烷脱氢(PDH)反应的烷基机理提供全面解释，也无法将其与碳正离子机理进行比较。所提供的文本似乎只是一篇科学文章的标题和作者信息，没有关于反应机理的详细内容。要准确回答这个问题，我需要获取该文章的全文或其他相关文献。
