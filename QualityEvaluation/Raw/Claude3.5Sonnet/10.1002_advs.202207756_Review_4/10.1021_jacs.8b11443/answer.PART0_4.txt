Unfortunately, I cannot provide a comprehensive explanation of the alkyl mechanism in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions on gallium-based catalysts or compare it to the carbenium mechanism based on the given literature. The provided text appears to be only a title and author information for an article, without any content about the mechanisms, steps, or rate-determining steps of PDH reactions. To accurately answer this question, we would need access to the full text of the article or additional relevant scientific literature on the topic.

很遗憾,基于所给的文献,我无法对镓基催化剂上丙烷脱氢(PDH)反应的烷基机理进行全面解释,也无法将其与碳正离子机理进行比较。提供的文本似乎只是一篇文章的标题和作者信息,没有包含有关PDH反应的机理、步骤或决速步骤的任何内容。要准确回答这个问题,我们需要获取文章的全文或其他相关的科学文献。
