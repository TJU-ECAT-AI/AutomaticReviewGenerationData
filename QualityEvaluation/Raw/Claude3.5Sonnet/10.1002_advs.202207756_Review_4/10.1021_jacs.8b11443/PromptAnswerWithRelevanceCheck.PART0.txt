Read the questions and answers provided below. First, critically assess the overall relevance of the answers provided to the set of questions asked.

If, upon your assessment, you find that the answers do not contain information that is relevant to the questions asked, stop your review process immediately and respond with a single sentence: "※※※※※※※The provided answers are not relevant to the questions.※※※※※※※". Do not provide any additional explanation or background information, only this sentence should be given as a response in case of irrelevant answers.

If, however, the answers are relevant to the questions asked, proceed to compile answers for each question according to the instructions below. Ensure to aggregate all the relevant answers from the multiple answer results provided in the document, and organize them sequentially by their order number, compiling the corresponding quotes, English answers, and Chinese answers for each question.

If the provided answers' quotes are not differentiated by question, ensure to break them down and assign the quotes to each respective question, outputting them separately within each question's section.

To provide a comprehensive review, differentiate the responses into quotes, English answers, and Chinese answers for each question based on the details given in the 'Answer' XML tags. Structure your review using the XML format showcased below if the answers are relevant to the questions asked:

<questions>

Provide a comprehensive explanation of the alkyl mechanism in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions on gallium-based catalysts, detailing its key steps from initial propane activation to product formation. Compare this mechanism to the carbenium mechanism, discuss why the CH activation step is proposed as the rate-determining step (RDS), and explain how the alkyl mechanism applies to different Ga species structures.

Unfortunately, I cannot provide a comprehensive explanation of the alkyl mechanism in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions on gallium-based catalysts or compare it to the carbenium mechanism based on the given literature. The provided text appears to be only a title and author information for a scientific article, without any content related to the specific mechanisms, steps, or comparisons requested in the question. The document does not contain sufficient information to address the query about CH activation as the rate-determining step or how the alkyl mechanism applies to different Ga species structures.

很遗憾,我无法根据所给的文献对镓基催化剂上丙烷脱氢(PDH)反应的烷基机理进行全面解释,也无法将其与碳正离子机理进行比较。提供的文本似乎只是一篇科学文章的标题和作者信息,没有包含与问题中要求的具体机理、步骤或比较相关的内容。该文档不包含足够的信息来解答关于CH活化作为速率决定步骤的查询,也无法解释烷基机理如何适用于不同的镓物种结构。

I apologize, but I cannot provide a comprehensive explanation of the alkyl mechanism in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions on gallium-based catalysts based on the given literature. The provided text does not contain any information about reaction mechanisms, key steps, or comparisons between different mechanisms. It only includes the title, authors, and publication details of a scientific article. Without access to the full text or additional information, I cannot accurately answer the question or discuss the alkyl mechanism, carbenium mechanism, rate-determining steps, or how the mechanism applies to different Ga species structures.
