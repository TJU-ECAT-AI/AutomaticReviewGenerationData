[1] "Ga species can promote the dehydrogenation of paraffins [41], while Brønsted acid sites facilitate oligomerization and aromatization [42,43]."

[2] "To gain insights into the roles of various Ga active species on the catalytic performance, the mechanism of n-pentane dehydrogenation, which was considered as the rate determining step of alkane aromatization [46], was investigated by means of quantum chemical calculations."

[3] "The mechanism for the GaH2+ embedded zeolite (Fig. 8B) has been proposed by the following three-step mechanism: (i) the activation of the C−H bond of n-pentane to form a Brønsted acid proton at zeolite framework (I → II → III); (ii) the desorption of hydrogen molecule (H1-H2Z) via a recombination of the acidic proton and one of the hydride ions attached to gallium atom (III → IV → V); (iii) the decomposition of Ga-C5H11 species to form alkene and gallium active sites (V → VI → VII → VIII) that could be regenerated in the presence of H2 or alkane feed [9a,49,54] as shown in Fig. 8B."

[4] "It was found that the rate determining step was the decomposition of Ga-C5H11 species to form 1-pentene with the activation energy of 63.8 kcal mol−1 (Fig. 8C, black)."

The alkyl mechanism for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) on gallium-based catalysts involves several key steps:

1. Propane activation: The C-H bond of propane is activated on the Ga active site, forming a Ga-alkyl intermediate and a Brønsted acid proton on the zeolite framework.

2. Hydrogen desorption: The acidic proton recombines with a hydride ion from the Ga species to form and desorb a hydrogen molecule.

3. Propene formation: The Ga-alkyl intermediate decomposes to form propene and regenerate the Ga active site.

The key difference between the alkyl mechanism and the carbenium mechanism is the nature of the intermediate formed. In the alkyl mechanism, a Ga-alkyl species is formed, while in the carbenium mechanism, a carbocation intermediate is involved.

The C-H activation step is often proposed as the rate-determining step (RDS) in PDH reactions. However, the literature provided suggests that for n-pentane dehydrogenation, the decomposition of the Ga-alkyl species to form the alkene is actually the RDS, with an activation energy of 63.8 kcal/mol.

The alkyl mechanism applies to different Ga species structures, but the activity can vary. Highly dispersed Ga species, such as GaH2+ embedded in zeolite nanosheets, show higher catalytic activity compared to bulk Ga2O3 fragments in conventional zeolites. This is due to the lower activation energy for the dehydrogenation step in the highly dispersed Ga species.

丙烷脱氢(PDH)反应在镓基催化剂上的烷基机理涉及几个关键步骤：

1. 丙烷活化：丙烷的C-H键在Ga活性位上被活化，形成Ga-烷基中间体和沸石骨架上的Brønsted酸质子。

2. 氢脱附：酸性质子与Ga物种的氢负离子重新结合，形成并脱附氢分子。

3. 丙烯形成：Ga-烷基中间体分解形成丙烯并再生Ga活性位。

烷基机理和碳正离子机理的主要区别在于形成的中间体的性质。在烷基机理中，形成的是Ga-烷基物种，而在碳正离子机理中，涉及的是碳正离子中间体。

C-H活化步骤通常被认为是PDH反应的决速步骤(RDS)。然而，所提供的文献表明，对于正戊烷脱氢，Ga-烷基物种分解形成烯烃才是真正的RDS，激活能为63.8 kcal/mol。

烷基机理适用于不同的Ga物种结构，但活性可能会有所不同。高度分散的Ga物种，如嵌入沸石纳米片中的GaH2+，与常规沸石中的体相Ga2O3片段相比，显示出更高的催化活性。这是由于高度分散的Ga物种在脱氢步骤中具有较低的激活能。
