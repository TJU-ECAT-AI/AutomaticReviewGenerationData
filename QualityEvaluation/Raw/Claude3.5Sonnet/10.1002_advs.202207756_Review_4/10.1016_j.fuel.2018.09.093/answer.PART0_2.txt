The provided literature does not contain information about the alkyl mechanism in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions on gallium-based catalysts. The document focuses on the aromatization of C5 hydrocarbons over Ga-modified hierarchical HZSM-5 nanosheets, but does not discuss the specific mechanism of propane dehydrogenation or compare it to the carbenium mechanism. The literature also does not mention why the C-H activation step is proposed as the rate-determining step in PDH reactions or how the alkyl mechanism applies to different Ga species structures. Therefore, this question cannot be adequately answered based solely on the information provided in the given document.

所提供的文献中不包含关于镓基催化剂上丙烷脱氢(PDH)反应的烷基机理的信息。该文档主要关注Ga改性的分级HZSM-5纳米片上C5烃的芳构化,但没有讨论丙烷脱氢的具体机理或将其与碳正离子机理进行比较。文献也没有提到为什么C-H活化步骤被提出作为PDH反应的速率决定步骤,或者烷基机理如何适用于不同的Ga物种结构。因此,仅根据给定文档中提供的信息无法充分回答这个问题。
