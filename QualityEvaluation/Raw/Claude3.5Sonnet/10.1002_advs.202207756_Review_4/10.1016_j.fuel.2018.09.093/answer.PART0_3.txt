[1] "To verify the nature of Ga species obtained on different supports, the powerful 71Ga NMR technique was used to characterize the Ga zeolite samples obtained by an ion-exchange method as shown in Fig. 1D."

[2] "To gain insights into the roles of various Ga active species on the catalytic performance, the mechanism of n-pentane dehydrogenation, which was considered as the rate determining step of alkane aromatization [46], was investigated by means of quantum chemical calculations."

[3] "The mechanism for the GaH2+ embedded zeolite (Fig. 8B) has been proposed by the following three-step mechanism: (i) the activation of the CeH bond of n-pentane to form a Brnsted acid proton at zeolite framework (I II III); (ii) the desorption of hydrogen molecule (H1-H2Z) via a recombination of the acidic proton and one of the hydride ions attached to gallium atom (III IV V); (iii) the decomposition of Ga-C5H11 species to form alkene and gallium active sites (V VI VII VIII) that could be regenerated in the presence of H2 or alkane feed [9a,49,54] as shown in Fig. 8B."

[4] "It was found that the rate determining step was the decomposition of Ga-C5H11 species to form 1-pentene with the activation energy of 63.8 kcal mol1 (Fig. 8C, black)."

The literature does not provide a comprehensive explanation of the alkyl mechanism in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions on gallium-based catalysts. However, it does describe a similar mechanism for n-pentane dehydrogenation on GaH2+ embedded zeolite catalysts, which can be used to infer information about the PDH reaction.

The mechanism described involves three key steps:

1. C-H bond activation: The alkane (n-pentane in this case) is activated by breaking a C-H bond, forming a Brønsted acid proton on the zeolite framework.

2. Hydrogen desorption: A hydrogen molecule is formed and desorbed through the recombination of the Brønsted acid proton and a hydride ion from the gallium species.

3. Alkene formation: The Ga-alkyl intermediate decomposes to form the alkene product and regenerate the gallium active site.

For n-pentane dehydrogenation, the rate-determining step is identified as the decomposition of the Ga-C5H11 species to form 1-pentene, with an activation energy of 63.8 kcal/mol. This step is likely analogous to the formation of propene in the PDH reaction.

While the document doesn't explicitly compare this mechanism to the carbenium mechanism or discuss why the C-H activation step is proposed as the rate-determining step in PDH reactions, it does provide insights into how the mechanism applies to different Ga species structures. The study compares the reactivity of highly dispersed Ga species on zeolite nanosheets to bulk Ga2O3 fragments in conventional zeolites, finding that the dispersed species are more favorable for alkane activation.

To fully answer the question about the PDH reaction specifically, additional information beyond what is provided in this document would be needed.

文献中并没有全面解释镓基催化剂上丙烷脱氢(PDH)反应的烷基机理。然而，它确实描述了类似的机理，即在GaH2+嵌入的沸石催化剂上进行正戊烷脱氢反应，这可以用来推断PDH反应的信息。

所描述的机理包括三个关键步骤：

1. C-H键活化：烷烃（在这种情况下是正戊烷）通过断裂C-H键被活化，在沸石骨架上形成布朗斯特酸质子。

2. 氢脱附：通过布朗斯特酸质子和来自镓物种的氢离子的重组，形成并脱附氢分子。

3. 烯烃形成：Ga-烷基中间体分解，形成烯烃产物并再生镓活性位点。

对于正戊烷脱氢，确定的速率决定步骤是Ga-C5H11物种分解形成1-戊烯，活化能为63.8 kcal/mol。这一步骤可能类似于PDH反应中丙烯的形成。

虽然文档没有明确比较这种机理与碳正离子机理，也没有讨论为什么在PDH反应中提出C-H活化步骤作为速率决定步骤，但它确实提供了关于该机理如何适用于不同Ga物种结构的见解。这项研究比较了沸石纳米片上高度分散的Ga物种与常规沸石中的块状Ga2O3碎片的反应活性，发现分散的物种更有利于烷烃活化。
