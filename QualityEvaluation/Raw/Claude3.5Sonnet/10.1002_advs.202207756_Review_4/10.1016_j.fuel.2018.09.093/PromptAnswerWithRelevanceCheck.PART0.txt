The literature does not provide a comprehensive explanation of the alkyl mechanism in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions on gallium-based catalysts. However, it does describe a similar mechanism for n-pentane dehydrogenation on GaH2+ embedded zeolite catalysts, which can be used to infer information about the PDH reaction.

The mechanism described involves three key steps:

1. C-H bond activation: The alkane (n-pentane in this case) is activated by breaking a C-H bond, forming a Brønsted acid proton on the zeolite framework.

2. Hydrogen desorption: A hydrogen molecule is formed and desorbed through the recombination of the Brønsted acid proton and a hydride ion from the gallium species.

3. Alkene formation: The Ga-alkyl intermediate decomposes to form the alkene product and regenerate the gallium active site.

For n-pentane dehydrogenation, the rate-determining step is identified as the decomposition of the Ga-C5H11 species to form 1-pentene, with an activation energy of 63.8 kcal/mol. This step is likely analogous to the formation of propene in the PDH reaction.

While the document doesn't explicitly compare this mechanism to the carbenium mechanism or discuss why the C-H activation step is proposed as the rate-determining step in PDH reactions, it does provide insights into how the mechanism applies to different Ga species structures. The study compares the reactivity of highly dispersed Ga species on zeolite nanosheets to bulk Ga2O3 fragments in conventional zeolites, finding that the dispersed species are more favorable for alkane activation.

To fully answer the question about the PDH reaction specifically, additional information beyond what is provided in this document would be needed.

文献中并没有全面解释镓基催化剂上丙烷脱氢(PDH)反应的烷基机理。然而，它确实描述了类似的机理，即在GaH2+嵌入的沸石催化剂上进行正戊烷脱氢反应，这可以用来推断PDH反应的信息。

所描述的机理包括三个关键步骤：

1. C-H键活化：烷烃（在这种情况下是正戊烷）通过断裂C-H键被活化，在沸石骨架上形成布朗斯特酸质子。

2. 氢脱附：通过布朗斯特酸质子和来自镓物种的氢离子的重组，形成并脱附氢分子。

3. 烯烃形成：Ga-烷基中间体分解，形成烯烃产物并再生镓活性位点。

对于正戊烷脱氢，确定的速率决定步骤是Ga-C5H11物种分解形成1-戊烯，活化能为63.8 kcal/mol。这一步骤可能类似于PDH反应中丙烯的形成。

虽然文档没有明确比较这种机理与碳正离子机理，也没有讨论为什么在PDH反应中提出C-H活化步骤作为速率决定步骤，但它确实提供了关于该机理如何适用于不同Ga物种结构的见解。这项研究比较了沸石纳米片上高度分散的Ga物种与常规沸石中的块状Ga2O3碎片的反应活性，发现分散的物种更有利于烷烃活化。

[1] "Ga species can promote the dehydrogenation of paraffins [41], while Brønsted acid sites facilitate oligomerization and aromatization [42,43]."

The alkyl mechanism for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) on gallium-based catalysts involves several key steps:

1. Propane activation: The C-H bond of propane is activated on the Ga active site, forming a Ga-alkyl intermediate and a Brønsted acid proton on the zeolite framework.

2. Hydrogen desorption: The acidic proton recombines with a hydride ion from the Ga species to form and desorb a hydrogen molecule.

3. Propene formation: The Ga-alkyl intermediate decomposes to form propene and regenerate the Ga active site.

The key difference between the alkyl mechanism and the carbenium mechanism is the nature of the intermediate formed. In the alkyl mechanism, a Ga-alkyl species is formed, while in the carbenium mechanism, a carbocation intermediate is involved.

The C-H activation step is often proposed as the rate-determining step (RDS) in PDH reactions. However, the literature provided suggests that for n-pentane dehydrogenation, the decomposition of the Ga-alkyl species to form the alkene is actually the RDS, with an activation energy of 63.8 kcal/mol.

The alkyl mechanism applies to different Ga species structures, but the activity can vary. Highly dispersed Ga species, such as GaH2+ embedded in zeolite nanosheets, show higher catalytic activity compared to bulk Ga2O3 fragments in conventional zeolites. This is due to the lower activation energy for the dehydrogenation step in the highly dispersed Ga species.

丙烷脱氢(PDH)反应在镓基催化剂上的烷基机理涉及几个关键步骤：

1. 丙烷活化：丙烷的C-H键在Ga活性位上被活化，形成Ga-烷基中间体和沸石骨架上的Brønsted酸质子。

2. 氢脱附：酸性质子与Ga物种的氢负离子重新结合，形成并脱附氢分子。

3. 丙烯形成：Ga-烷基中间体分解形成丙烯并再生Ga活性位。

烷基机理和碳正离子机理的主要区别在于形成的中间体的性质。在烷基机理中，形成的是Ga-烷基物种，而在碳正离子机理中，涉及的是碳正离子中间体。

C-H活化步骤通常被认为是PDH反应的决速步骤(RDS)。然而，所提供的文献表明，对于正戊烷脱氢，Ga-烷基物种分解形成烯烃才是真正的RDS，激活能为63.8 kcal/mol。

烷基机理适用于不同的Ga物种结构，但活性可能会有所不同。高度分散的Ga物种，如嵌入沸石纳米片中的GaH2+，与常规沸石中的体相Ga2O3片段相比，显示出更高的催化活性。这是由于高度分散的Ga物种在脱氢步骤中具有较低的激活能。
