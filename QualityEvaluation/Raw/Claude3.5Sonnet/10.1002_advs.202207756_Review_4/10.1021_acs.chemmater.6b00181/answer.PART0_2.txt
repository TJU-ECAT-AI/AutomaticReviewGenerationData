<EnglishVersionAnswer>

The given scientific literature does not contain any information about the alkyl mechanism in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions on gallium-based catalysts. The text appears to be about controlling aluminum isolation and pairing in chabazite zeolites, which is unrelated to the question asked. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to the question based on the given literature.
