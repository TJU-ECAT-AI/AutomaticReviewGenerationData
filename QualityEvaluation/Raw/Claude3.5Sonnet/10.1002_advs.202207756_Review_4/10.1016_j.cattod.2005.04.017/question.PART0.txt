The roles of gallium hydride and Brnsted acidity in light
alkane dehydrogenation mechanisms using Ga-exchanged
HZSM-5 catalysts: A DFT pathway analysis

Abstract
We have used density functional theory (DFT) to study light alkane dehydrogenation by Ga-exchanged HZSM-5 by considering two
types of catalytic sites: a mono-Al site of the form Z[HGaX]+ (X = H, CH3, OH, Cl) and a di-Al site of the form Z2[GaH]2+. For the
mono-Al site, we report a new, direct one-step dehydrogenation mechanism; however, we conclude in general that mono-Al sites in ZSM-
5 are not likely responsible for alkane dehydrogentation, as calculated activation energies are too high compared to experimental values
(60 kcal/mol versus 39 kcal/mol). Instead, we propose [GaH]2+ residing near di-Al sites (Z2[GaH]2+) are more active sites for
dehydrogenation. We report a three-step mechanism for di-Al sites consisting of (1) CH activation, followed by (2) alkene desorption
and (3) H2 removal. We find that as AlAl distance increases, the activation barrier for CH activation decreases (ranging from 85.72
to 38.38 to 19.69 kcal/mol), while the barrier for H2 removal increases (ranging from 15.49 to 36.71 to 47.38 kcal/mol)resulting
in an optimal AlAl separation distance of 4.53 A
 arising from these competing trends. As a result, we propose a simple structure-to-
activity correlation based on the Sabatier principle, which could be used to model and design the catalyst with required dehydrogenation
activity.

1. Introduction
Light alkane aromatization using shape selective MFI-
based catalysts is an important chemical process to upgrade
light alkane feedstocks like liquefied petroleum gas (LPG).
The valuable aromatics produced by this process find
important commercial applications in downstream pro-
cesses. Unfortunately, the substantial cracking activity of
unmodified HZSM-5 catalyst leads to a large selectivity for
C1 and C2 products. This problem is overcome by adding
additional dehydrogenation function in the form of extra-
framework species like Ga, Zn and Pt. The improved activity
and selectivity due to these extra-framework species has
made possible commercial applications such as the Cyclar
and Aeroforming processes. The elevated hydrogenolysis
activity of Pt-based catalysts and the volatility of Zn species
in H2 at higher temperatures, has lead to the identification of
Ga-HZSM-5 catalysts as a commercially viable choice [1].
See the recent review by Fricke et al. [2] covering various
applications of Ga-based zeolite catalysts.
There has been a constant effort to improve the selectivity
of these catalytic systems by understanding the role of the
extra-framework species. A large number of experimental
investigations of gallium oxides and Ga-HZSM-5 catalysts
have been reported [323] in the literature. Some review
articles [2426] provide a concise summary of all the
experimental work done in the past. For a pure Brnsted acid
catalyzed mechanism, hydride transfer has been identified as
an important reaction path for initial removal of hydrogen
from light alkanes. However, this redistribution of the
hydrogen in the lower alkanes causes reduction in the
aromatics selectivity. A study involving careful comparison
of the initial cracking rates versus dehydrogenation rates

[27] for HZSM-5 concluded that the same Brnsted acid site
is involved in the dehydrogenation as in cracking. Thus, to
enhance dehydrogenation in comparison with cracking one
needs to change the initial dehydrogenation mechanism
completely. Hence, the additional dehydrogenation function
by extra-framework Ga improves selectivity with simulta-
neous generation of molecular hydrogen as a valuable side
product. Also, experimentally it has been observed [11,28]
that propene is far more reactive than propane, and hence it
was concluded that initial dehydrogenation is likely to be the
rate-limiting step.
Initially, it was suggested that the gallium oxide phase
was the source of the catalytic activity in Ga-HZSM-5, as it
was shown that Ga2O3 is capable of H2 dissociation [7],
dehydrogenation and dehydrocyclization [6,12]. However, it
was found that the intrinsic dehydrogenation activity of
Ga2O3-HZSM-5 is better than that of Ga2O3 alone. The
decrease in the dehydrogenation activity of Ga2O3-HZSM-5
upon exchange of Brnsted protons with Na+ lead to the
conclusion that this catalyst operates via a bifunctional
mechanism [4]. In the proposed mechanism by Meriaudeau
and Naccache [4], the GaO coordination from oxide phase
activates the CH bond and the alkoxide species is
exchanged with a Brnsted acid site. Eventually, both H2
and the alkene desorb to regenerate the active sites. There
are several other studies [15,29,30] proposing bifunctional
mechanisms; however, they differ with respect to the details
of the mechanistic steps. Iglesia et al. [29] concluded that
Brnsted acid sites cause CH activation, while Ga is
responsible for recombinative desorption of the surface
hydrogen atoms. Gnep et al. [30] proposed that Ga sites and
Brnsted sites work independently, where Ga carries out
dehydrogenation, while regular Brnsted acid sites catalyze
oligomerization, b-scission and cyclization steps. This
hypothesis was further supported by the work from Kwak
and Sachtlers group [16], where they located an optimum
[Ga]/([Ga] + [H+]) ratio for activity and selectivity in Ga-
HZSM-5. A hydrogen back-spillover phenomenon [31] has
been proposed to support the H2 removal ability of Ga
species from the distant Brnsted sites.
Some experimental efforts were also aimed at elucidating
the nature of the active site. By studying the extent of
reduction of GaH/Na-ZSM-5, Price and Kanazirev [23]
concluded that the active catalyst consists of Ga in its
reduced state. They concluded that Brnsted acid sites play
an important role in the reduction of gallium oxide species.
Using in situ Ga K-edge X-ray adsorption spectroscopy,
Meitzner et al. [32] showed that for the catalysts under
working conditions, the nature of the active Ga species is
GaHx. This was further confirmed by recent work from
Kazansky et al. [33] using DRIFTS. The authors showed that
the characteristic GaH bond stretching frequency indicates
the heterogeneity of GaHx species on the catalyst surface.
Also, CO adsorption studies pointed out the presence of the
three types of sites in the reduced catalyst: (a) [HGaH]+, (b)
[HGaOH]+ and (c) low coordinated Ga+. The authors
pointed out that the relative populations of these sites were
very sensitive to the H2 partial pressure and temperature.
The GaH stretching band showed decreased intensity after
evacuation at the higher temperature. However, it is not
clear, which one is the active site for dehydrogenation.
Compared to the experimental literature, theoretical
investigations of the dehydrogenation mechanism, and the
nature of the active site for this system, are limited. Methane
activation on [Ga O]+ species was studied by Himei et al.
[34] and Broclawik et al. [35]. Gonzales et al. [36] studied
the reduction process of [Ga(OH)2]+ by considering inter-
conversion of different gallium species such as [Ga O]+,
[HGaOH]+, Ga+ and [HGaH]+. Their study concluded that
[HGaOH]+ species are kinetically the most favored species.
However, this study could not explain the experimentally
observed higher activity of the Ga-HZSM-5 for H2/D2
exchange. Frash and van Santen [37] considered a similar
gallium site to study the ethane dehydrogenation reaction
pathway. The authors classified the reaction paths as of two
types: (i) a carbenium activation pathway consisting an
alkoxide-like intermediate along the reaction path after the
activation of the CH (Rd+Hd) bond and (ii) an alkyl
activation pathway supporting the formation of GaC
coordination after the activation of the CH bond (Rd
Hd+). After a detailed analysis the authors concluded that the
alkyl activation path for [HGaH]+ species is the actual path
for dehydrogenation. However, this conclusion was based on
the observation that at higher temperatures, the initial CH
activation step becomes the rate-determining step, and the
calculated activation barrier (3940 kcal/mol) for this first
step is in close agreement with the experimentally estimated
value of 39 kcal/mol [20]. These trends in the reaction rate

temperature were mainly contributed by the entropy loss
during the formation of the surface activated complex. With
explicit consideration of physisorbed species under the
influence of van der Waals interactions, it will be difficult to
draw similar conclusions. The entropy loss from a gas phase
reactant to an active intermediate cannot be entirely assigned
to the initial step of the reaction mechanism, as the motion of
the molecule is already confined to the zeolite channel
system. However, to study initial adsorption process
quantitatively, a QM/MM model of the active site [38] is
needed as it explicitly accounts for the van der Waals
attractive interactions. In general, we can say there are
disagreements between the experimental results and the
calculations. Hence, further investigations are necessary to
confirm the nature of the active sites and other possible
dehydrogenation mechanisms.

provide an opportunity to study the effect of polar
environment on one-step dehydrogenation mechanisms.
These sites consist of gallium species next to one framework
aluminum. There have been significant disagreements
[39,40] in the literature regarding the distribution of Al in
the zeolite framework. It has been shown [41] that pairs of
framework Al provide a significant polar environment.
Hence, we have also considered the possibility of Ga species
near two-framework Al for our investigations. In doing so,
we have concentrated on the effect of the AlAl distance on
the energetics of the carbenium activation reaction path.
The rest of this paper is organized as follows. In Section 2,
we describe the details of the computational method and
cluster selection. Section 3 consists of the results and
discussions. In this section, we report the direct dehydro-
genation path on Z[HGaX]+ and the carbon number
dependence of the activation barrier. In the same section, we
put fort the reaction path for Z2[GaH]2+ catalytic site (dual
Al-sites). In Section 4, we summarize the conclusions of our
work.
2. Cluster models and computational details
The ZSM-5 pore structure (MFI) consists of straight
channels and sinusoidal channels running perpendicular to
each other. The most active sites are generally thought to be
located at the cross-section of these channels, as they are
easily accessible by the reactants. In this work, we employed
a cluster approximation to model the active sites in Ga-
ZSM-5. All the clusters we used employed Si-H termina-
tions with fixed bond lengths of 1.4979 A
 (the computed
bond distance for free SiH4 using the equivalent level of the
theory). The terminal Si and H atoms were then held fixed at
their initial Cartesian positions for all subsequent calcula-
tions. The clusters were selected to represent two types of
active sites; sites consisting of one framework aluminum and
sites consisting of two-framework Al atoms. For the first
type of site, our cluster consisted of 11 T sites from the ZSM-
5 lattice structure as reported in the literature [42]. These
lattice positions were located around the T12 position at the
cross-section of the straight channel and the sinusoidal

channel. It has been shown that this size of the cluster is
sufficiently accurate for the system under consideration, as
Gonzales et al. [36] showed near-convergence of the various
heats of reactions for a five T cluster. Si4+ at the T12 position
was replaced by Al3+ and charge-compensated by an extra-
framework cationic species. In our investigation, we
considered the effect of different extra-framework gallium
species on the one-step reaction pathway for dehydrogena-
tion. The geometries of these clusters (IIV) are shown in
Fig. 1. The location of the 11 T cluster in the MFI framework
is shown in Fig. 1e and f. The Mulliken charge on the Ga
atom increases as the electronegativity of the bonded atom
increases as listed in Table 1.
Our second type of active site model consisted of a
gallium species [GaH]2+ next to two aluminum sites. We
considered three different clusters for this type of site. The
first cluster (V) was a six-membered ring located along the
straight channel and consisted of two T11, two T12 and two
T07 tetrahedral T sites. In total, the cluster model contained
10 T sites. The location of the 10 T cluster in the MFI
framework is shown in Fig. 2d. The silicon atoms at the two
T11 positions were replaced by Al atom. A charge
compensating [GaH]2+ was symmetrically placed between
the two Al atoms, coordinated with four proximal oxygens
from the ring with an observed GaO distance of 2.02 A
 . For
the optimized geometry, the distance between two Al atoms
was 4.53 A
 . In order to study the effect of ring size on the
dehydrogenation reaction, we considered a second type of
Z2[GaH]2+ models (VI and VII) consisting of an elongated
eight-membered ring. In total, this cluster consists of 14 T
sites. The location of this cluster, representing an eight-
membered ring, is shown in Fig. 2e. The bare silicalite
structure has a plane of symmetry as shown in Fig. 2d or e.
This gives rise to pairs of T12 and T07 positions in the

clusters VI and VII. However, Al substitution at only one of
the T12 (or T07) site breaks the symmetry. We substituted Si
with Al at the T12 and T07 positions in these clusters.
Although Al substitution was carried out at the same T
positions, these two structures (VI and VII) are symme-
trically non-equivalent geometries out of the four possible
combinations for Al pair substitution. In the relaxed cluster
(structure VI), the distance between the two Al atoms was
4.60 A
 . We found that Ga coordinates with four lattice
oxygen atoms in a square planar fashion. The GaO distance
varied from 2.04 to 2.23 A
 , while the GaH bond distance
(1.54 A
 ) is slightly longer than that for site V.
To study the effect of the position of Al atoms in the ring,
we have studied an alternative cluster (VII) with [GaH]2+
species sitting in the same eight-membered ring. However,
the Al pair in this model occupied the T12 and T07 positions
(shown in Fig. 2) with a relaxed AlAl distance of 5.53 A
 . In
this case, the gallium species was mainly coordinated with
three-lattice oxygen having GaO distances from 2.04 to
2.14 A
 . Important geometry and charge parameters of all
seven-site models are listed in Tables 1 and 2. In this study,
we considered Al substitution at different T sites like T12,
T11 and T07. Schroder et al. [43] have used an ion-shell pair
potential model to simulate the Al location at different
framework positions. That study indicated a possibility of
the random distribution of the framework Al due to narrow
energy distribution among these structures. A similar
conclusion was also drawn by Ricchiardi and Newsam
[44] using force field methods. In the cluster models with
two Al sites, Al substitutions are made in accordance with
Lowensteins rule, which forbids the Al substitution on
neighboring T sites.
Our calculations were conducted using a double zeta
631g (d,p) basis set [45]. For gallium, this basis set
corresponds to the compact contracted basis set by Binning
and Curtiss [46] with d-polarization, and it has different
structure than the traditional 631g basis set. For non-
transition elements in the third row, mainly s- and p-type
functions are involved in the bonding. However, the impor-
tance of the d-functions in the geometry optimization [47,48]
necessitates the presence of the d-polarization functions for
the Ga basis set. Recently a true 631g basis set for third row
elements [48] was put forth, although its performance is
equivalent to the one by Binning and Curtiss [46].
We have used a Becke three-parameter hybrid functional
[49] (B3LYP) for this study. Previous work by Frash and van
Santen [37] on the same system showed that this level of
theory is adequate to draw consistent comparisons between
different mechanisms. All of our calculations were done
using the Gaussian03 program package [50]. Transition
states were calculated using the quadratic synchronous
transit (QST) method [51]. Validity of the critical transition
states was confirmed using (1) imaginary frequency mode
visualization, (2) relaxation by perturbing transition states
along the imaginary frequency mode and (3) rigorous
internal reaction coordinate (IRC) [52] relaxation. All the
reported energies are corrected for zero point energy (ZPE)
by doing normal mode analysis of the intermediates along
the reaction paths. The inaccurate normal modes due to the
frozen atoms in the cluster calculations are projected out of
the Hessian to have consistent ZPE correction for a
particular reaction path. The basis set superposition error
(BSSE) was neglected, while calculating energetics for
different mechanisms. A larger triple zeta (e.g. 6311g)
basis set will reduce [53] the basis set superposition error.
The popular counterpoise method by Boys and Bernardi [54]
can be used to estimate the BSSE; however, this often leads
to the overestimation of the error [53]. For both stable
intermediates and transition states, default convergence

3. Results and discussion
To carry out a consistent comparison between several
dehydrogenation mechanisms, we first investigated the alkyl
activation pathway proposed by Frash and van Santen [37]
using a larger cluster model (11 T cluster, site I) of the
catalytic site than their original work. We find that the
activation energy for initial CH activation is substantially
higher (48.66 kcal/mol) compared to their previously
calculated [37] value of 37.9 kcal/mol. We attribute the
higher activation barrier to greater steric hindrance for CH
insertion caused by the constrained geometry of our cluster
model. We have also located an additional transition state
(TS2) for the rotation of the tetrahedral [H2GaC2H5] species.
The energetics for this mechanism is given in Fig. 3 with
geometry and charge parameters listed in Table 3. The O24
H3 distances in the structures VIII and IX indicate the
formation of the Brnsted acid site during the reaction path.
Simultaneously, the Mulliken charge on the Ga is very close
to zero. The structure VIII (as shown in Fig. 4) could be
formed by adsorption of the H2GaC2H5 species on the
Brnsted acid site. The adsorption energy we calculated for
this transformation was 16.87 kcal/mol, indicating the
strong binding for this intermediate.
The stable intermediate in CH activation proceeds
through rotation of the tetrahedral Ga species about the
GaO20 coordination (process VIII ! TS2 ! IX in Fig. 4).
As shown in Fig. 3, we observed very weakly activated
transition states for this rotation followed by the removal of a
H2 molecule (process IX ! TS3 ! X + H2 in Fig. 4). For
TS3 in particular, the zero point energy correction was
actually larger than the non-corrected activation energy
(which within transition state theory corresponds to a net
negative Gibbs free energy change at the transition state).
We indicated this in Fig. 3 as a negative (ZPE corrected)
activation barrier, which can be interpreted as essentially an
unactivated process.
The activation barrier for the alkyl desorption (process
X ! TS4 in Fig. 3) was 61.67 kcal/mol, which is in close
agreement with the previously reported [37] value of
60.7 kcal/mol. This close agreement reflects the fact that
the hydrocarbon species has very little interaction with the
zeolite framework for this step of the mechanism. This high
activationbarrierfor thealkylremovalstepshouldleadtovery
low intrinsic reaction rate for the alkyl activation mechanism.
This illuminates the essential problem with our understanding
of CH activation that current computational studies have yet
to adequately explain the relatively low experimental [20]
activation energy of 39 kcal/mol. We conclude from the

mechanism for Ga-assisted dehydrogenation.
3.1. Direct dehydrogenation mechanism
In light of this conclusion, we investigated several other
options, including the possibility of a direct (one-step)
dehydrogenation of the hydrocarbon on a Z[HGaH]+
species. As shown in Scheme 1, hydrogen from one of the
alkane carbons combines with hydrogen from the active
Ga-site to form molecular hydrogen. At the same time the

coordination. Thus, in one-step there is a formation of an
alkene and molecular hydrogen, and at the same time the
catalytic site is regenerated.
Direct dehydrogenation involves breaking two CH and
one GaH bond with the simultaneous formation of HH
and GaH bonds. In addition the CC bond length decreases
with a CC p-bond formation. In Fig. 5, we show the
potential energy diagram for direct dehydrogenation for
ethane, propane and n-butane. The comparison of the
geometry parameters for transition states is reported in
Table 4. The geometry parameters for all the transition states

were very similar. The total Mulliken charge on the
individual fragments (H2, CnH2n, Z+[HGaH]) in the
transition state structures were nearly zero. Similarly, we
observed very small individual charges on the hydrogen
atoms involved in the geometry transformation. We also
observe the activation barrier for dehydrogenation decreases
with the presence of the secondary carbon. This was
expected since the secondary carbon has higher tendency to
donate H compared to the primary carbon. The activation
barrier for n-butane is about 4 kcal/mol lower compared to
that of the ethane. This trend agrees with the experimental
finding [26] that dehydrogenation of the higher alkanes (C4)
is easier than that of lower alkanes (C2).
We note that the second hydrogen from the gallium
dihydride extra-framework species is not involved in the
reaction. Hence, to study the effect of the charge on the
gallium atom on the activation barrier for the direct
dehydrogenation path, we replaced this hydrogen with
methyl (CH3), hydroxyl (OH) and chlorine (Cl)
designated generically as X. From Table 1, we show that the
charge on the Ga is proportional to the electronegativity of
the bonded constituent X. In Table 1, we listed heats of
reaction for removal of X using H2. We find that reduction of
Z[HGaX]+ is endothermic when X is OH or Cl. Thus, the
presence of these species is quite possible under reaction
conditions unless an elaborate reduction procedure is used
for
catalyst
pretreatment.
At
the
same
time,
direct
dehydrogenation on these catalytic sites yields lower
activation barriers. Thus, more electronegative species
introduce a polar environment around the gallium, which

facilitates the bond breaking and formation process. This
results is in agreement with experimental results [19],
which, starting from GaCl3-impregnated HZSM-5, reports
higher initial activity for propane aromatization.
Geometries of the transition states and the reaction path

different
[HGaX]+ species are shown in Fig. 6. The activation
energy for [HGaCl]+ is 56.13 kcal/mol, which is lower
than that for [HGaH]+ (59.15 kcal/mol). However, we like
to note that the activation barrier for dehydrogenation by
the direct dehydrogenation mechanism (61.17 kcal/mol) is
similar to the highest barrier for the alkyl activation
reaction path discussed above. Once again, we are forced
to conclude that both direct activation on the reduced
([HGaH]+) single site as well as alternatively ligated single
[HGaX]+ sites, are not correct representations of the true
CH activation pathway.
3.2. Carbenium activation pathway for Z2[GaH]2+
species
Examining the mechanism above (Fig. 3), we observe
that during alkyl activation, the alkene desorption step
(process X ! TS4) faces a very high activation energy (as
high as 61.67 kcal/mol). Based on the work by Frash and van
Santen [37] and our subsequent extension presented above,
we conclude that for Z[HGaH]+ sites, it will generally be
very difficult, if not impossible, to find a reaction path with
low enough activation barriers to match experimental results
[20]. At the same time, our results in the previous section
indicate that a polar environment around the Ga species
can have significant effect on reaction energetics. What we
show now is that the polarity of the GaO coordination can
be enhanced by placing Ga species in the vicinity of two
Al T sites.

Fig. 7. Carbenium activation path of ethane dehydrogenation on Z2GaH2+ species (V) in six-membered ring: (a) reaction path consisting two-distinct steps and
(b) geometry transformations during dehydrogenation path (naming convention for oxygen to define geometry parameters in Table 5).
In an attempt to find a catalytic environment, which better
facilitates alkene desorption, we considered three-different
sites for this study. The first active site represents an a-type
site as per the classification of pair sites by Dedecek et al.
[55] These sites consist of a pair of five-membered rings
fused to form a slightly elongated six-membered ring. As
shown in Fig. 2a, the gallium species [GaH]2+ sits at the
center of the rectangle of the four oxygen atoms. The GaO
distance is about 2.02 A
 with significant positive charge on
gallium. In Table 2, we provide the geometry and charge
parameters for all sites considered containing pairs of Al.
The bare gallium mono-hydride site can be reduced using
H2 to form a regular gallium di-hydride and Brnsted acid
site. For the a-typesite (V), we found this reaction (process
V + H2 ! XII) to be endothermic with 27.88 kcal/mol heat
of reaction. We will, hence forth, refer to this as H2 site-
reduction and designate the heat of this reaction as DHred.
The stability of the [GaH]2+ species, signified by the
endothermic heat of H2 site-reduction, is in agreement with
the similar results for Zn2+ species by Shubin et al. [56] and
Barbosa et al. [57] Thus, at lower temperature most of the
a-type sites will be in the dehydrogenated form as
described above.
Our investigation of the carbenium activation mechanism
consists of three-distinct steps: (1) activation of the CH
bond and formation of an alkoxide like intermediate, (2)
removal of the primary alkoxide by desorption of an alkene
and (3) desorption of molecular hydrogen to complete the
catalytic cycle. For the a-type site (V), we report the
reaction path for carbenium activation in Fig. 7a. We have
limited our investigation only to the activation of the CH
bond and removal of dihydrogen to regenerate the active
site. Desorption of an alkene starting from the primary
alkoxide has been extensively studied [58,59], and the
activation barrier for this process should be about 35
40 kcal/mol.
For catalytic site V, we find the energy barrier for CH
activation is 85.72 kcal/mol, corresponding to the initial
alkane adsorption and hydrogen removal. Schematically, the
[GaH]2+ species is responsible for removing hydrogen from
the alkane during this step, forming the traditional [HGaH]+
moiety residing on one of the Al atoms. The alkyl species
subsequently adsorbs as an alkoxide near the second Al. The
activation barrier for this step (process V + C2H6 ! TS11 in
Fig. 7) is very high considering the other reaction paths we
have presented so far. The transition state geometry
(structure TS11 in Fig. 7) for CH activation shows the
sp2 hybrid character of the carbon involved. As the
tetrahedral carbon looses one of its hydrogens to gallium,
it inverts to adsorb as an alkoxide on the opposite framework
oxygen. This mechanism can be visualized as a sn2 attack by
framework oxygen (conjugate base of the Brnsted acid site)
on the tetrahedral carbon center. In Table 5, we list the
geometry and charge parameters for all the species along the
catalytic cycle. In the transition state (TS11), the hydro-
carbon species carries more positive charge as electrons
populate the covalent bond between the H and Ga. The
gallium dihydride formed in this process is similar to the
active site discussed in the previous sections. Ethene
subsequently desorbs from the primary alkoxide, leaving
behind the Brnsted acid site.
We observe strong hydrogen bonding between the
Brnsted proton and the hydridic hydrogen in structure XII
(Fig. 7b). Due to this interaction, the Brnsted proton bends
out of plane by an angle of 37.88. Also, the positive charge on
the proton induces a small negative charge on the hydridic
hydrogen. This polarization helps hydrogen removal step,
which has an activation barrier of only 15.49 kcal/mol. The
GaH stretching frequency (1914 cm1) for the polarized
GaH bond is markedly lower than the non-polar GaH bond
(1995 cm1). However, we note that the activation barrier for
reverse reaction (H2 adsorption) is rather high (44.55 kcal/
mol), which makes the site kinetically stable (less active). We
observe that the activation barrier for hydrogen removal is
substantially smaller than that for CH activation. The
activation barrier for CH activation is directly related to the
large endothermicity of the CH activation step (DE =
51.40 kcal/mol).
The other two cluster models containing two Al T sites
(VI and VII), represent the g-type site according to the
classification by Dedecek et al. [55]. Model VI consists of
two five-membered rings connected by a four-membered
ring. This site is located along the walls of the sinusoidal
channel near the cross-section of the straight and the
sinusoidal channel. Comparing AlAl distances in the
relaxed models, we find 4.60 A
 for structure VI (Fig. 2)
compared to 5.53 A
 for structure VII (Fig. 2). Qualitatively,
the Al pair was placed parallel to the sinusoidal channel for
site VI and for site VII it was placed diagonally along the
channel surface. The heats of H2 site-reduction (DHred) for
these two models (processes VI ! XV and VII ! XVIII)

were 0.15 and 19.57 kcal/mol (Table 2), respectively. Thus,
the process of forming Brnsted acid/gallium dihydride pairs
is thermo-neutral for site VI and exothermic for site VII;
suggesting that the [GaH]2+ species are less stable in larger
eight-membered ring structures. However, our reported
energies of reaction for H2 site-reduction make the presence
of both [GaH]2+ and [HGaH]+ species feasible under normal
reaction conditions. Since structures VI and VII represent the
same silicalite framework and have same stoichiometry, we
can directly compare the total energy for these structures. We
find VI is more stable compared to structure VII by
12.55 kcal/mol. Considering the narrow energy distribution
for framework substitution at different T sites, this stability
could be attributed to the optimum coordination of the [GaH]+
species with framework oxygen atoms in case of structure VI.
AfterreductionbyH2(aftertheformationoftheBrnstedacid
site and Z[HGaH]+ pair) the stability order is reversed. We
find structure XVIII more stable compared to XV by only
3.68 kcal/mol. This small difference in the energies is
expected as the Brnsted proton and [HGaH]+ occupy
crystallographically equivalent positions (T12 and T07)
individually in XV and XVIII. However, these structures
are symmetrically non-equivalent as explained in Section 2.
In Fig. 8, we report the energetics of the carbenium
activation mechanism for site VI. We found that the CH
activation part consists of two steps. In the first step (process
VI ! XIII in Fig. 8), the GaO coordination opens such that
Ga is coordinated with only two framework oxygens (O17
and O23). The coordinatively unsaturated GaH species is
partially satisfied by the methyl group of ethane as shown in
the structure XIII (Fig. 8b). In this structure we observed an
increase in the negative charge on the primary carbon (C1)

parameters in Table 6).
and an increase in the positive charge on the hydrogen
bonded to it. Thus, the CH bonds of the methyl group
become much more polar during insertion. This adsorption
reaction (process VI ! TS13 ! XIII in Fig. 8) is activated
by 38.38 kcal/mol. After the insertion, the methyl group
slightly rotates, loosing hydrogen to form [HGaH]+ species
and adsorbs itself as an alkoxide. The transition state for this
second step (process XIII ! TS14 ! XIV in Fig. 8) is
activated by 19.09 kcal/mol. As discussed previously the
transient geometry has sp2 carbon character, which under-
goes sn2 inversion. The presence of the intermediate
(structure XIII) during the CH activation process is
kinetically significant. It should enhance the dehydrogena-
tion rate by reducing the apparent activation energy.
However, the lower stability of the [GaH]2+ species results
in a penalty for the hydrogen removal process. In this model,
the hydrogen removal step (process XV ! TS15 ! VI+H2
in Fig. 8) is activated by 36.71 kcal/mol, but overall, the
current catalytic site (structure VI) should have better
dehydrogenation activity compared to the a-type site
discussed previously. In Table 6, we listed the geometry and
the charge parameters for all the intermediates along this
reaction path.
A similar reaction path for g-type site with different Al
positions (VII) is shown in Fig. 9. The exothermic
dissociative adsorption of H2 (Table 2) indicates that this
catalytic site is more active than the models V and VI.
Hence, the CH dissociation reaction faces a very low
energy barrier. In model VII, the two-step process of
dissociative adsorption of ethane has activation energies of

19.69 kcal/mol (process VII + C2H6 ! TS16 ! XVI in
Fig. 9) and 18.12 kcal/mol (process XVI ! TS17 ! XVII
in Fig. 9), respectively. Thus, the activation barriers for the
second step of CH activation are similar for the sites VI and
VII, and hence the activation barrier for the initial insertion
of the methyl group in GaO coordination can be easily
correlated to the stability of the site. The H2 removal step
(process XVIII ! TS18 ! VII + H2 in Fig. 9) has sig-
nificantly
higher
activation
barrier
of
47.38 kcal/mol
compared to that for structure VI (36.72 kcal/mol). Thus,
an increase in the AlAl distance will further increase the H2
removal activation barrier. Important geometry and charge
parameters for the intermediates along this reaction path are
reported in Table 7.
A schematic representation of the energetics for three-
catalytic sites is shown in the Scheme 2. Catalytic sites XII,
XV and XVIII, before the removal of hydrogen, consist of a
Brnsted acid site and [HGaH]+ species together. In the
Scheme 2, we have shifted the energetics of all three-catalytic
sites in such a way that the energies of the structures XII, XV
and XVIII are aligned. Now, the relative energies of the
species represent the relative activity or stability of the
intermediates on individual scales. With our calculations
we find that there is a natural optimum for the activity of the
Z2[GaH]2+ site. If it is too stable, like in model V for the
six-membered ring, the initial activation of the CH bond is
very high, while regeneration of the catalyst site, and H2
removal, has a lower activation barrier. On the other hand, if
the catalyst site is very active, like in model VII for the eight-
membered ring, then the CH activation barrier is very low.
However, the regeneration of the same active catalyst site by
H2 removal faces a higher activation barrier.
On closer examination of the Scheme 2, the Brnsted
EvansPolanyi relations seems applicable for both CH
activation and H2 removal steps as DHred and Eact are clearly
correlated for the individual steps. This concept of optimum
activity of the catalyst site is more popularly known as the
Sabatier principle in the heterogeneous catalysis literature.
In this particular case, we relate the activity directly to the
catalyst site geometry. A simple correlation between the Al
Al distance and the activity for dehydrogenation can then be
formulated. Another possibility is to formulate such
correlations in terms of the stability if the [GaH]+ species
(DHred) at the different extra-framework positions. As shown
in Table 2, stability of the site can be quantified in terms of
the heat of reaction for H2 site reduction. In Fig. 10, we have
plotted the important activation energies for both (i) CH
activation and (ii) H2 removal against the DHred for H2 site
reduction. For the thermo-neutral heat of reaction (model
VI), we observe the optimum activity of the catalyst site.
These kinds of correlations will provide simple structure
activity relations, which could be used to manipulate the
dehydrogenation activity of the catalyst. Although our
investigation indicates the extra-framework Ga in the

probability of finding the Al pairs in high Si/Al zeolites.
However, our results indicate that the Al pairs in larger
(eight-membered) rings should give better dehydrogenation
activity. A recent study by Gabova et al. [60] suggests that
the fraction of the Al pair sites depends on the source of the
Al. They point out that although the majority of the Al
represents the isolated sites, depending on the source of the
Al, the faction representing the Al pair sites can be as high as
27%. Dedecek et al. [40] reported a significant faction
(45%) of Al existing as pair sites even at higher Si/Al ratio
for a particular sample of ZSM-5. Although the statistical
probability of finding pair Al sites assuming a random
distribution is low for high Si/Al ratio zeolite, the actual
probability is a strong function of the synthesis method.
Industrially, the choice of high Si/Al ratio zeolites is
influenced by the improved selectivity and lower deactiva-
tion of such material. Clearly, a further investigation is
needed regarding the dehydrogenation activity of the Ga-
HZSM-5 catalyst at different Si/Al ratio prepared using
different synthesis procedures.
In Table 8, we report the GaH stretching frequencies
(both as calculated and scaled) for different structures.
The recommended [61] scaling factor for the frequencies for
the current level of theory [B3LYP/6-31g(d,p)] is 0.9614.
We calculated a scaling factor of 0.9529 by comparing the
experimental and calculated GaH frequency in GaH3 gas
phase
molecule.
After
scaling,
the
GaH
stretching
frequencies for the Z2[GaH]2+ catalytic sites match with
the experimental [33] GaH stretching frequencies of 2041
and 2059 cm1. Although it is difficult to conclude these
peaks correspond to Z2[GaH]2+, since we expect relatively
low concentration of the [GaH]2+ moieties, the DRIFTS
peaks are at least consistent with our Z2[GaH]2+ Al-pair
site model.
4. Conclusions
A one-step dehydrogenation path was investigated and
the effects of alkane chain length, and the relative charge on
the gallium in Z[HGaX]+ catalyst site model were studied.
We find the one-step dehydrogenation path, where several
simultaneous
bond
scission
and
formation
steps
are
involved, is favored by a polar environment surrounding
Ga
species.
The
activation
barrier
for
the
one-step
dehydrogenation path is comparable with the maximum
activation barrier for previously proposed alkyl mechanisms.
However, activation barriers for all single-site GaH2-based
mechanisms result in activation energies that are much too
high to reconcile experimental observations (activation
energy of 39 kcal/mol). Thus, we conclude that a single site,
[HGaH]+, model does not represent the true mechanism for
Ga-assisted dehydrogenation.
We subsequently investigated the possibility of alkane
activation mechanisms by gallium species [GaH]2+ in
proximity to two aluminum T sites. Out of three-
Z2[GaH]2+ sites investigated, all with varying AlAl
distances, we find the gallium species in the six-membered
ring represent the most stable site (highest DHred). In models
of eight-membered rings, larger AlAl distances corre-
sponded to lower site stability. The trends in reactivity show
that higher site stability, and consequently smaller AlAl
distances, resulted in larger activation barriers for CH
activation (85.72 kcal/mol) and lower barriers for H2
desorption and site regeneration (15.49 kcal/mol). Thus,
we found an optimal AlAl distance (4.53 A
 ) corresponding
to a minimum overall barrier (38.38 kcal/mol for CH
activation and 36.71 kcal/mol H2 removal) for dehydrogena-
tion reaction as a result of the competition between these two
trends. This competition between two trends exemplifies the

applicability of the Sabatier principle. We conclude that out
of several possible catalytic sites in Ga-HZSM-5, extra-
framework gallium species near pairs of tetrahedral Al have
higher activity, and the activity of these sites can be
correlated to AlAl distance. We expect these results could
be useful for systematic exploration of viable zeolite
frameworks and site geometries in the interest of designing
novel catalysts for alkane activation processes.
