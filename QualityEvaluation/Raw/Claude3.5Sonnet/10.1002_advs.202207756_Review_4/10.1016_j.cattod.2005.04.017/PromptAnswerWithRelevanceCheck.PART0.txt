[1] "For a pure Brnsted acid catalyzed mechanism, hydride transfer has been identified as an important reaction path for initial removal of hydrogen from light alkanes."

[2] "Frash and van Santen [37] considered a similar gallium site to study the ethane dehydrogenation reaction pathway. The authors classified the reaction paths as of two types: (i) a carbenium activation pathway consisting an alkoxide-like intermediate along the reaction path after the activation of the CH (Rd+Hd) bond and (ii) an alkyl activation pathway supporting the formation of GaC coordination after the activation of the CH bond (Rd Hd+)."

[3] "After a detailed analysis the authors concluded that the alkyl activation path for [HGaH]+ species is the actual path for dehydrogenation. However, this conclusion was based on the observation that at higher temperatures, the initial CH activation step becomes the rate-determining step, and the calculated activation barrier (3940 kcal/mol) for this first step is in close agreement with the experimentally estimated value of 39 kcal/mol [20]."

[4] "We report a three-step mechanism for di-Al sites consisting of (1) CH activation, followed by (2) alkene desorption and (3) H2 removal."

[5] "We find that as AlAl distance increases, the activation barrier for CH activation decreases (ranging from 85.72 to 38.38 to 19.69 kcal/mol), while the barrier for H2 removal increases (ranging from 15.49 to 36.71 to 47.38 kcal/mol)resulting in an optimal AlAl separation distance of 4.53 A arising from these competing trends."

The alkyl mechanism for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) on gallium-based catalysts involves several key steps:

1. Initial CH activation: A CH bond in propane is broken, forming a GaC bond and transferring a hydrogen to the catalyst.

2. Alkyl intermediate formation: The propyl group bonds to the gallium site, creating an alkyl intermediate.

3. β-hydride elimination: A hydrogen from the β-carbon is transferred to the gallium, forming propene.

4. Product desorption: Propene desorbs from the catalyst surface.

5. Catalyst regeneration: Molecular hydrogen is removed, regenerating the active gallium site.

The main difference between the alkyl and carbenium mechanisms is the nature of the intermediate formed after CH activation. In the alkyl mechanism, a GaC bond is formed, while in the carbenium mechanism, an alkoxide-like intermediate is created through a CH bond cleavage.

The CH activation step is proposed as the rate-determining step (RDS) because:

1. At higher temperatures, it becomes the slowest step in the reaction.
2. The calculated activation barrier for this step (39-40 kcal/mol) closely matches experimental observations (39 kcal/mol).

The alkyl mechanism applies differently to various Ga species structures:

1. For single-site [HGaH]+ species, the alkyl mechanism is proposed but results in activation energies that are too high to match experimental observations.

2. For di-Al sites with [GaH]2+ species, a three-step mechanism is reported, consisting of CH activation, alkene desorption, and H2 removal.

3. The activation barriers for CH activation and H2 removal vary with the AlAl distance in di-Al sites. As the AlAl distance increases, the CH activation barrier decreases, while the H2 removal barrier increases. This results in an optimal AlAl separation distance of 4.53 Å, balancing these competing trends and providing the best overall catalytic activity.

丙烷脱氢(PDH)在镓基催化剂上的烷基机理包括几个关键步骤：

1. 初始CH活化：丙烷中的CH键断裂，形成GaC键并将氢转移到催化剂上。

2. 烷基中间体形成：丙基与镓位点结合，形成烷基中间体。

3. β-氢消除：β-碳上的氢转移到镓上，形成丙烯。

4. 产物脱附：丙烯从催化剂表面脱附。

5. 催化剂再生：分子氢被移除，重新生成活性镓位点。

烷基机理和碳正离子机理的主要区别在于CH活化后形成的中间体性质。在烷基机理中，形成GaC键，而在碳正离子机理中，通过CH键断裂形成类似烷氧化物的中间体。

CH活化步骤被提出为速率决定步骤(RDS)，原因如下：

1. 在较高温度下，它成为反应中最慢的步骤。
2. 该步骤的计算活化能（39-40 kcal/mol）与实验观察结果（39 kcal/mol）非常接近。

烷基机理对不同的Ga物种结构的应用有所不同：

1. 对于单位点[HGaH]+物种，虽然提出了烷基机理，但得到的活化能过高，无法与实验观察结果相匹配。

2. 对于具有[GaH]2+物种的双Al位点，报告了一个三步机理，包括CH活化、烯烃脱附和H2移除。

3. 在双Al位点中，CH活化和H2移除的活化能随AlAl距离的变化而变化。随着AlAl距离增加，CH活化能垒降低，而H2移除能垒增加。这导致最佳AlAl分离距离为4.53 Å，平衡了这些竞争趋势，提供最佳的整体催化活性。

The alkyl mechanism for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) on gallium-based catalysts involves several key steps:

1. Initial CH activation: The propane molecule interacts with the gallium species, leading to the breaking of a CH bond. This forms a GaC coordination.

2. Alkyl intermediate formation: The broken CH bond results in the formation of an alkyl intermediate attached to the gallium site.

3. β-hydride elimination: A hydrogen atom from the β-carbon is transferred to the gallium, forming a GaH bond and creating a CC double bond.

4. Product desorption: The alkene (propene) desorbs from the catalyst surface.

5. Catalyst regeneration: The hydrogen atoms on the gallium site combine and desorb as H2, regenerating the active gallium site.

Comparing this to the carbenium mechanism:
The carbenium mechanism involves the formation of an alkoxide-like intermediate after CH bond activation, while the alkyl mechanism forms a direct GaC bond. The carbenium pathway proceeds through a carbocation-like transition state, whereas the alkyl pathway maintains a more covalent character throughout.

The CH activation step is proposed as the rate-determining step (RDS) because:
1. It has the highest activation energy in the reaction sequence.
2. The calculated activation barrier (39-40 kcal/mol) closely matches experimental observations.
3. At higher temperatures, this step becomes increasingly important in determining the overall reaction rate.

The alkyl mechanism applies differently to various Ga species structures:

1. For single-site Z[HGaH]+ species, the alkyl mechanism is possible but faces high activation barriers.

2. For Z2[GaH]2+ species near two Al sites, the mechanism is more favorable. The AlAl distance significantly affects the energetics:
   - Shorter AlAl distances (e.g., in 6-membered rings) lead to higher CH activation barriers but lower H2 removal barriers.
   - Longer AlAl distances (e.g., in 8-membered rings) result in lower CH activation barriers but higher H2 removal barriers.
   - An optimal AlAl distance of around 4.53 Å balances these competing trends, providing the most favorable overall energetics for the alkyl mechanism.

These structural variations highlight the importance of the local environment around the gallium species in determining the efficiency of the alkyl mechanism in PDH reactions.

丙烷脱氢(PDH)反应在镓基催化剂上的烷基机理包括几个关键步骤：

1. 初始CH活化：丙烷分子与镓物种相互作用，导致CH键断裂。这形成了GaC配位。

2. 烷基中间体形成：断裂的CH键导致形成附着在镓位点上的烷基中间体。

3. β-氢消除：来自β碳的氢原子转移到镓上，形成GaH键并创建CC双键。

4. 产物脱附：烯烃（丙烯）从催化剂表面脱附。

5. 催化剂再生：镓位点上的氢原子结合并以H2形式脱附，再生活性镓位点。

与碳正离子机理相比：
碳正离子机理在CH键活化后形成类似烷氧基的中间体，而烷基机理形成直接的GaC键。碳正离子途径通过类似碳正离子的过渡态进行，而烷基途径在整个过程中保持更多的共价特性。

CH活化步骤被提出为速率决定步骤（RDS）因为：
1. 它在反应序列中具有最高的活化能。
2. 计算的活化能障（39-40 kcal/mol）与实验观察closely吻合。
3. 在更高的温度下，这一步骤在决定整体反应速率中变得越来越重要。

烷基机理对不同Ga物种结构的应用：

1. 对于单位点Z[HGaH]+物种，烷基机理是可能的，但面临高活化能障。

2. 对于靠近两个Al位点的Z2[GaH]2+物种，该机理更有利。AlAl距离显著影响能量学：
   - 较短的AlAl距离（例如在6元环中）导致更高的CH活化能障，但更低的H2去除能障。
   - 较长的AlAl距离（例如在8元环中）导致更低的CH活化能障，但更高的H2去除能障。
   - 约4.53 Å的最佳AlAl距离平衡了这些相互竞争的趋势，为烷基机理提供了最有利的整体能量学。

这些结构变化突出了镓物种周围局部环境在决定PDH反应中烷基机理效率方面的重要性。

The alkyl mechanism for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) on gallium-based catalysts involves three key steps:

1. CH activation: This is the initial step where a CH bond in propane is broken, forming an alkyl intermediate bonded to the gallium species.

2. Alkene desorption: The alkyl intermediate then undergoes β-hydride elimination to form propene, which desorbs from the catalyst surface.

3. H2 removal: The final step involves the recombination and removal of hydrogen atoms to form H2, regenerating the active gallium site.

Compared to the carbenium mechanism, which involves the formation of a carbocation intermediate, the alkyl mechanism proceeds through a more covalent Ga-C bond intermediate. 

The CH activation step is proposed as the rate-determining step (RDS) for several reasons:
- It has the highest activation energy in most cases
- Experimental observations show propene is far more reactive than propane, suggesting the initial C-H bond breaking is the slowest step
- Subsequent steps like alkene desorption and H2 removal generally have lower barriers

The alkyl mechanism applies differently to various Ga species structures:

- For mono-Al sites (e.g. Z[HGaX]+), the calculated activation energies are too high (around 60 kcal/mol) compared to experimental values (39 kcal/mol), suggesting these sites are not likely responsible for dehydrogenation.

- For di-Al sites (Z2[GaH]2+), the mechanism is more favorable. The Al-Al distance plays a crucial role:
  - As Al-Al distance increases, the CH activation barrier decreases (from 85.72 to 19.69 kcal/mol)
  - However, the H2 removal barrier increases with Al-Al distance (from 15.49 to 47.38 kcal/mol)
  - An optimal Al-Al distance of 4.53 Å was found, balancing these competing trends

This structure-activity relationship highlights the importance of the local environment around the Ga species in determining catalytic activity for PDH reactions.

2. 烯烃脱附：烷基中间体随后经过β-氢消除形成丙烯，并从催化剂表面脱附。

3. H2脱除：最后一步涉及氢原子的重组和脱除以形成H2，重新生成活性镓位点。

与涉及碳正离子中间体形成的碳正离子机理相比，烷基机理通过更具共价性的Ga-C键中间体进行。

CH活化步骤被提出为速率决定步骤(RDS)，原因如下：
- 在大多数情况下，它具有最高的活化能
- 实验观察表明丙烯比丙烷反应活性高得多，这表明初始C-H键断裂是最慢的步骤
- 随后的步骤如烯烃脱附和H2脱除通常具有较低的能垒

烷基机理对不同的Ga物种结构的应用不同：

- 对于单Al位点（例如Z[HGaX]+），计算的活化能太高（约60 kcal/mol），与实验值（39 kcal/mol）相比，表明这些位点不太可能负责脱氢。

- 对于双Al位点（Z2[GaH]2+），该机理更有利。Al-Al距离起着至关重要的作用：
  - 随着Al-Al距离的增加，CH活化能垒降低（从85.72降至19.69 kcal/mol）
  - 然而，H2脱除能垒随Al-Al距离增加而增加（从15.49增至47.38 kcal/mol）
  - 发现最佳Al-Al距离为4.53 Å，平衡了这些相互竞争的趋势

The alkyl mechanism for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) on gallium-based catalysts involves multiple steps:

1. Initial propane activation: The C-H bond of propane is activated by the gallium species, likely [GaH]2+ near di-Al sites.

2. Formation of alkyl intermediate: The activated propane forms an alkyl intermediate, coordinating with the gallium species.

3. Hydrogen transfer: A hydrogen atom is transferred from the propane to the gallium, forming a [HGaH]+ species.

4. Alkoxide formation: The remaining propyl group adsorbs as an alkoxide on the zeolite framework.

5. Alkene desorption: The propene molecule desorbs from the alkoxide intermediate.

6. H2 removal: Molecular hydrogen is removed, regenerating the initial [GaH]2+ active site.

Compared to the carbenium mechanism, the alkyl mechanism involves the formation of a Ga-C bond in the intermediate stages, rather than a purely ionic interaction.

The C-H activation step is proposed as the rate-determining step (RDS) based on experimental observations that propene is far more reactive than propane. This suggests that the initial dehydrogenation of propane is the slowest step in the overall process.

The alkyl mechanism applies differently to various Ga species structures:

1. For mono-Al sites (Z[HGaX]+), the activation energies are too high (around 60 kcal/mol) compared to experimental values (39 kcal/mol), making these sites unlikely to be responsible for alkane dehydrogenation.

2. For di-Al sites (Z2[GaH]2+), the mechanism is more favorable. The activation energy for C-H activation decreases with increasing Al-Al distance, while the barrier for H2 removal increases. This results in an optimal Al-Al separation distance of about 4.53 Å, balancing these competing trends.

3. The stability and activity of the Ga species depend on their proximity to framework Al atoms, with di-Al sites showing higher activity for dehydrogenation compared to mono-Al sites.

In summary, the alkyl mechanism on gallium-based catalysts is most effective on di-Al sites with optimal Al-Al distances, where it proceeds through a series of steps involving C-H activation, alkyl intermediate formation, and subsequent dehydrogenation to form propene.

在镓基催化剂上的丙烷脱氢（PDH）烷基机理包括多个步骤：

1. 初始丙烷活化：丙烷的C-H键被镓物种激活，可能是靠近双Al位点的[GaH]2+。

2. 形成烷基中间体：活化的丙烷形成烷基中间体，与镓物种配位。

3. 氢转移：一个氢原子从丙烷转移到镓上，形成[HGaH]+物种。

4. 烷氧基形成：剩余的丙基作为烷氧基吸附在沸石骨架上。

5. 烯烃脱附：丙烯分子从烷氧基中间体脱附。

6. H2移除：分子氢被移除，使初始[GaH]2+活性位点再生。

与碳正离子机理相比，烷基机理在中间阶段涉及Ga-C键的形成，而不是纯粹的离子相互作用。

C-H活化步骤被提出为速率决定步骤（RDS），这是基于实验观察到丙烯比丙烷反应活性更高。这表明丙烷的初始脱氢是整个过程中最慢的步骤。

烷基机理对不同的Ga物种结构的应用不同：

1. 对于单Al位点（Z[HGaX]+），活化能太高（约60 kcal/mol），与实验值（39 kcal/mol）相比差异较大，使这些位点不太可能负责烷烃脱氢。

2. 对于双Al位点（Z2[GaH]2+），该机理更有利。随着Al-Al距离的增加，C-H活化的活化能降低，而H2移除的障碍增加。这导致最佳Al-Al分离距离约为4.53 Å，平衡了这些相互竞争的趋势。

3. Ga物种的稳定性和活性取决于它们与骨架Al原子的接近程度，与单Al位点相比，双Al位点表现出更高的脱氢活性。

总之，镓基催化剂上的烷基机理在具有最佳Al-Al距离的双Al位点上最为有效，它通过一系列步骤进行，包括C-H活化、烷基中间体形成和随后的脱氢形成丙烯。
