[1] "We find that as AlAl distance increases, the activation barrier for CH activation decreases (ranging from 85.72 to 38.38 to 19.69 kcal/mol), while the barrier for H2 removal increases (ranging from 15.49 to 36.71 to 47.38 kcal/mol)resulting in an optimal AlAl separation distance of 4.53 A"

[2] "For the mono-Al site, we report a new, direct one-step dehydrogenation mechanism; however, we conclude in general that mono-Al sites in ZSM-5 are not likely responsible for alkane dehydrogentation, as calculated activation energies are too high compared to experimental values (60 kcal/mol versus 39 kcal/mol)."

[3] "Instead, we propose [GaH]2+ residing near di-Al sites (Z2[GaH]2+) are more active sites for dehydrogenation. We report a three-step mechanism for di-Al sites consisting of (1) CH activation, followed by (2) alkene desorption and (3) H2 removal."

[4] "After the insertion, the methyl group slightly rotates, loosing hydrogen to form [HGaH]+ species and adsorbs itself as an alkoxide. The transition state for this second step (process XIII ! TS14 ! XIV in Fig. 8) is activated by 19.09 kcal/mol. As discussed previously the transient geometry has sp2 carbon character, which undergoes sn2 inversion."

[5] "Also, experimentally it has been observed [11,28] that propene is far more reactive than propane, and hence it was concluded that initial dehydrogenation is likely to be the rate-limiting step."

The alkyl mechanism for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) on gallium-based catalysts involves multiple steps:

1. Initial propane activation: The C-H bond of propane is activated by the gallium species, likely [GaH]2+ near di-Al sites.

2. Formation of alkyl intermediate: The activated propane forms an alkyl intermediate, coordinating with the gallium species.

3. Hydrogen transfer: A hydrogen atom is transferred from the propane to the gallium, forming a [HGaH]+ species.

4. Alkoxide formation: The remaining propyl group adsorbs as an alkoxide on the zeolite framework.

5. Alkene desorption: The propene molecule desorbs from the alkoxide intermediate.

6. H2 removal: Molecular hydrogen is removed, regenerating the initial [GaH]2+ active site.

Compared to the carbenium mechanism, the alkyl mechanism involves the formation of a Ga-C bond in the intermediate stages, rather than a purely ionic interaction.

The C-H activation step is proposed as the rate-determining step (RDS) based on experimental observations that propene is far more reactive than propane. This suggests that the initial dehydrogenation of propane is the slowest step in the overall process.

The alkyl mechanism applies differently to various Ga species structures:

1. For mono-Al sites (Z[HGaX]+), the activation energies are too high (around 60 kcal/mol) compared to experimental values (39 kcal/mol), making these sites unlikely to be responsible for alkane dehydrogenation.

2. For di-Al sites (Z2[GaH]2+), the mechanism is more favorable. The activation energy for C-H activation decreases with increasing Al-Al distance, while the barrier for H2 removal increases. This results in an optimal Al-Al separation distance of about 4.53 Å, balancing these competing trends.

3. The stability and activity of the Ga species depend on their proximity to framework Al atoms, with di-Al sites showing higher activity for dehydrogenation compared to mono-Al sites.

In summary, the alkyl mechanism on gallium-based catalysts is most effective on di-Al sites with optimal Al-Al distances, where it proceeds through a series of steps involving C-H activation, alkyl intermediate formation, and subsequent dehydrogenation to form propene.

在镓基催化剂上的丙烷脱氢（PDH）烷基机理包括多个步骤：

1. 初始丙烷活化：丙烷的C-H键被镓物种激活，可能是靠近双Al位点的[GaH]2+。

2. 形成烷基中间体：活化的丙烷形成烷基中间体，与镓物种配位。

3. 氢转移：一个氢原子从丙烷转移到镓上，形成[HGaH]+物种。

4. 烷氧基形成：剩余的丙基作为烷氧基吸附在沸石骨架上。

5. 烯烃脱附：丙烯分子从烷氧基中间体脱附。

6. H2移除：分子氢被移除，使初始[GaH]2+活性位点再生。

与碳正离子机理相比，烷基机理在中间阶段涉及Ga-C键的形成，而不是纯粹的离子相互作用。

C-H活化步骤被提出为速率决定步骤（RDS），这是基于实验观察到丙烯比丙烷反应活性更高。这表明丙烷的初始脱氢是整个过程中最慢的步骤。

烷基机理对不同的Ga物种结构的应用不同：

1. 对于单Al位点（Z[HGaX]+），活化能太高（约60 kcal/mol），与实验值（39 kcal/mol）相比差异较大，使这些位点不太可能负责烷烃脱氢。

2. 对于双Al位点（Z2[GaH]2+），该机理更有利。随着Al-Al距离的增加，C-H活化的活化能降低，而H2移除的障碍增加。这导致最佳Al-Al分离距离约为4.53 Å，平衡了这些相互竞争的趋势。

3. Ga物种的稳定性和活性取决于它们与骨架Al原子的接近程度，与单Al位点相比，双Al位点表现出更高的脱氢活性。

总之，镓基催化剂上的烷基机理在具有最佳Al-Al距离的双Al位点上最为有效，它通过一系列步骤进行，包括C-H活化、烷基中间体形成和随后的脱氢形成丙烯。
