[1] "For a pure Brnsted acid catalyzed mechanism, hydride transfer has been identified as an important reaction path for initial removal of hydrogen from light alkanes."

[2] "Frash and van Santen [37] considered a similar gallium site to study the ethane dehydrogenation reaction pathway. The authors classified the reaction paths as of two types: (i) a carbenium activation pathway consisting an alkoxide-like intermediate along the reaction path after the activation of the CH (Rd+Hd) bond and (ii) an alkyl activation pathway supporting the formation of GaC coordination after the activation of the CH bond (Rd Hd+)."

[3] "After a detailed analysis the authors concluded that the alkyl activation path for [HGaH]+ species is the actual path for dehydrogenation. However, this conclusion was based on the observation that at higher temperatures, the initial CH activation step becomes the rate-determining step, and the calculated activation barrier (3940 kcal/mol) for this first step is in close agreement with the experimentally estimated value of 39 kcal/mol [20]."

[4] "We report a three-step mechanism for di-Al sites consisting of (1) CH activation, followed by (2) alkene desorption and (3) H2 removal."

[5] "We find that as AlAl distance increases, the activation barrier for CH activation decreases (ranging from 85.72 to 38.38 to 19.69 kcal/mol), while the barrier for H2 removal increases (ranging from 15.49 to 36.71 to 47.38 kcal/mol)resulting in an optimal AlAl separation distance of 4.53 A arising from these competing trends."

The alkyl mechanism for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) on gallium-based catalysts involves several key steps:

1. Initial CH activation: A CH bond in propane is broken, forming a GaC bond and transferring a hydrogen to the catalyst.

2. Alkyl intermediate formation: The propyl group bonds to the gallium site, creating an alkyl intermediate.

3. β-hydride elimination: A hydrogen from the β-carbon is transferred to the gallium, forming propene.

4. Product desorption: Propene desorbs from the catalyst surface.

5. Catalyst regeneration: Molecular hydrogen is removed, regenerating the active gallium site.

The main difference between the alkyl and carbenium mechanisms is the nature of the intermediate formed after CH activation. In the alkyl mechanism, a GaC bond is formed, while in the carbenium mechanism, an alkoxide-like intermediate is created through a CH bond cleavage.

The CH activation step is proposed as the rate-determining step (RDS) because:

1. At higher temperatures, it becomes the slowest step in the reaction.
2. The calculated activation barrier for this step (39-40 kcal/mol) closely matches experimental observations (39 kcal/mol).

The alkyl mechanism applies differently to various Ga species structures:

1. For single-site [HGaH]+ species, the alkyl mechanism is proposed but results in activation energies that are too high to match experimental observations.

2. For di-Al sites with [GaH]2+ species, a three-step mechanism is reported, consisting of CH activation, alkene desorption, and H2 removal.

3. The activation barriers for CH activation and H2 removal vary with the AlAl distance in di-Al sites. As the AlAl distance increases, the CH activation barrier decreases, while the H2 removal barrier increases. This results in an optimal AlAl separation distance of 4.53 Å, balancing these competing trends and providing the best overall catalytic activity.

丙烷脱氢(PDH)在镓基催化剂上的烷基机理包括几个关键步骤：

1. 初始CH活化：丙烷中的CH键断裂，形成GaC键并将氢转移到催化剂上。

2. 烷基中间体形成：丙基与镓位点结合，形成烷基中间体。

3. β-氢消除：β-碳上的氢转移到镓上，形成丙烯。

4. 产物脱附：丙烯从催化剂表面脱附。

5. 催化剂再生：分子氢被移除，重新生成活性镓位点。

烷基机理和碳正离子机理的主要区别在于CH活化后形成的中间体性质。在烷基机理中，形成GaC键，而在碳正离子机理中，通过CH键断裂形成类似烷氧化物的中间体。

CH活化步骤被提出为速率决定步骤(RDS)，原因如下：

1. 在较高温度下，它成为反应中最慢的步骤。
2. 该步骤的计算活化能（39-40 kcal/mol）与实验观察结果（39 kcal/mol）非常接近。

烷基机理对不同的Ga物种结构的应用有所不同：

1. 对于单位点[HGaH]+物种，虽然提出了烷基机理，但得到的活化能过高，无法与实验观察结果相匹配。

2. 对于具有[GaH]2+物种的双Al位点，报告了一个三步机理，包括CH活化、烯烃脱附和H2移除。

3. 在双Al位点中，CH活化和H2移除的活化能随AlAl距离的变化而变化。随着AlAl距离增加，CH活化能垒降低，而H2移除能垒增加。这导致最佳AlAl分离距离为4.53 Å，平衡了这些竞争趋势，提供最佳的整体催化活性。
