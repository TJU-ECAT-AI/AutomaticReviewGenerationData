[1] "For a pure Brnsted acid catalyzed mechanism, hydride transfer has been identified as an important reaction path for initial removal of hydrogen from light alkanes."

[2] "Frash and van Santen [37] considered a similar gallium site to study the ethane dehydrogenation reaction pathway. The authors classified the reaction paths as of two types: (i) a carbenium activation pathway consisting an alkoxide-like intermediate along the reaction path after the activation of the CH (Rd+Hd) bond and (ii) an alkyl activation pathway supporting the formation of GaC coordination after the activation of the CH bond (Rd Hd+)."

[3] "After a detailed analysis the authors concluded that the alkyl activation path for [HGaH]+ species is the actual path for dehydrogenation. However, this conclusion was based on the observation that at higher temperatures, the initial CH activation step becomes the rate-determining step, and the calculated activation barrier (3940 kcal/mol) for this first step is in close agreement with the experimentally estimated value of 39 kcal/mol [20]."

[4] "We report a three-step mechanism for di-Al sites consisting of (1) CH activation, followed by (2) alkene desorption and (3) H2 removal."

[5] "We find that as AlAl distance increases, the activation barrier for CH activation decreases (ranging from 85.72 to 38.38 to 19.69 kcal/mol), while the barrier for H2 removal increases (ranging from 15.49 to 36.71 to 47.38 kcal/mol)resulting in an optimal AlAl separation distance of 4.53 A arising from these competing trends."

The alkyl mechanism for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) on gallium-based catalysts involves several key steps:

1. Initial CH activation: The propane molecule interacts with the gallium species, leading to the breaking of a CH bond. This forms a GaC coordination.

2. Alkyl intermediate formation: The broken CH bond results in the formation of an alkyl intermediate attached to the gallium site.

3. β-hydride elimination: A hydrogen atom from the β-carbon is transferred to the gallium, forming a GaH bond and creating a CC double bond.

4. Product desorption: The alkene (propene) desorbs from the catalyst surface.

5. Catalyst regeneration: The hydrogen atoms on the gallium site combine and desorb as H2, regenerating the active gallium site.

Comparing this to the carbenium mechanism:
The carbenium mechanism involves the formation of an alkoxide-like intermediate after CH bond activation, while the alkyl mechanism forms a direct GaC bond. The carbenium pathway proceeds through a carbocation-like transition state, whereas the alkyl pathway maintains a more covalent character throughout.

The CH activation step is proposed as the rate-determining step (RDS) because:
1. It has the highest activation energy in the reaction sequence.
2. The calculated activation barrier (39-40 kcal/mol) closely matches experimental observations.
3. At higher temperatures, this step becomes increasingly important in determining the overall reaction rate.

The alkyl mechanism applies differently to various Ga species structures:

1. For single-site Z[HGaH]+ species, the alkyl mechanism is possible but faces high activation barriers.

2. For Z2[GaH]2+ species near two Al sites, the mechanism is more favorable. The AlAl distance significantly affects the energetics:
   - Shorter AlAl distances (e.g., in 6-membered rings) lead to higher CH activation barriers but lower H2 removal barriers.
   - Longer AlAl distances (e.g., in 8-membered rings) result in lower CH activation barriers but higher H2 removal barriers.
   - An optimal AlAl distance of around 4.53 Å balances these competing trends, providing the most favorable overall energetics for the alkyl mechanism.

These structural variations highlight the importance of the local environment around the gallium species in determining the efficiency of the alkyl mechanism in PDH reactions.

丙烷脱氢(PDH)反应在镓基催化剂上的烷基机理包括几个关键步骤：

1. 初始CH活化：丙烷分子与镓物种相互作用，导致CH键断裂。这形成了GaC配位。

2. 烷基中间体形成：断裂的CH键导致形成附着在镓位点上的烷基中间体。

3. β-氢消除：来自β碳的氢原子转移到镓上，形成GaH键并创建CC双键。

4. 产物脱附：烯烃（丙烯）从催化剂表面脱附。

5. 催化剂再生：镓位点上的氢原子结合并以H2形式脱附，再生活性镓位点。

与碳正离子机理相比：
碳正离子机理在CH键活化后形成类似烷氧基的中间体，而烷基机理形成直接的GaC键。碳正离子途径通过类似碳正离子的过渡态进行，而烷基途径在整个过程中保持更多的共价特性。

CH活化步骤被提出为速率决定步骤（RDS）因为：
1. 它在反应序列中具有最高的活化能。
2. 计算的活化能障（39-40 kcal/mol）与实验观察closely吻合。
3. 在更高的温度下，这一步骤在决定整体反应速率中变得越来越重要。

烷基机理对不同Ga物种结构的应用：

1. 对于单位点Z[HGaH]+物种，烷基机理是可能的，但面临高活化能障。

2. 对于靠近两个Al位点的Z2[GaH]2+物种，该机理更有利。AlAl距离显著影响能量学：
   - 较短的AlAl距离（例如在6元环中）导致更高的CH活化能障，但更低的H2去除能障。
   - 较长的AlAl距离（例如在8元环中）导致更低的CH活化能障，但更高的H2去除能障。
   - 约4.53 Å的最佳AlAl距离平衡了这些相互竞争的趋势，为烷基机理提供了最有利的整体能量学。

这些结构变化突出了镓物种周围局部环境在决定PDH反应中烷基机理效率方面的重要性。
