[1] "For a pure Brnsted acid catalyzed mechanism, hydride transfer has been identified as an important reaction path for initial removal of hydrogen from light alkanes."

[2] "Frash and van Santen [37] considered a similar gallium site to study the ethane dehydrogenation reaction pathway. The authors classified the reaction paths as of two types: (i) a carbenium activation pathway consisting an alkoxide-like intermediate along the reaction path after the activation of the CH (Rd+Hd) bond and (ii) an alkyl activation pathway supporting the formation of GaC coordination after the activation of the CH bond (Rd Hd+)."

[3] "After a detailed analysis the authors concluded that the alkyl activation path for [HGaH]+ species is the actual path for dehydrogenation. However, this conclusion was based on the observation that at higher temperatures, the initial CH activation step becomes the rate-determining step, and the calculated activation barrier (3940 kcal/mol) for this first step is in close agreement with the experimentally estimated value of 39 kcal/mol [20]."

[4] "We report a three-step mechanism for di-Al sites consisting of (1) CH activation, followed by (2) alkene desorption and (3) H2 removal."

[5] "We find that as AlAl distance increases, the activation barrier for CH activation decreases (ranging from 85.72 to 38.38 to 19.69 kcal/mol), while the barrier for H2 removal increases (ranging from 15.49 to 36.71 to 47.38 kcal/mol)resulting in an optimal AlAl separation distance of 4.53 A arising from these competing trends."

The alkyl mechanism for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) on gallium-based catalysts involves several key steps:

1. Initial CH activation: The propane molecule interacts with the gallium active site, leading to the breaking of a CH bond. This forms a GaC coordination.

2. Alkyl intermediate formation: The activated propane forms an alkyl intermediate species bound to the gallium.

3. β-hydride elimination: A hydrogen atom from the β-carbon is transferred to the gallium, forming a GaH bond and creating a CC double bond.

4. Product desorption: The formed propene desorbs from the catalyst surface.

5. Catalyst regeneration: The GaH species releases H2, regenerating the active gallium site.

Comparing this to the carbenium mechanism:
The carbenium mechanism involves the formation of an alkoxide-like intermediate after CH bond activation, while the alkyl mechanism forms a direct GaC bond. The carbenium pathway proceeds through a carbocation-like transition state, whereas the alkyl mechanism maintains a more covalent character throughout.

The CH activation step is proposed as the rate-determining step (RDS) because:
1. It has the highest activation barrier in the reaction sequence.
2. The calculated activation energy for this step (39-40 kcal/mol) closely matches experimental observations.
3. At higher temperatures, this initial step becomes more kinetically significant compared to subsequent steps.

The alkyl mechanism applies differently to various Ga species structures:
1. For single-site [HGaH]+ species, the alkyl mechanism faces high activation barriers, making it less likely.
2. For Ga species near di-Al sites (Z2[GaH]2+), the alkyl mechanism becomes more favorable.
3. The AlAl distance in di-Al sites significantly affects the energetics of the alkyl mechanism:
   - Shorter AlAl distances lead to higher CH activation barriers but lower H2 removal barriers.
   - Longer AlAl distances result in lower CH activation barriers but higher H2 removal barriers.
   - An optimal AlAl distance of around 4.53 Å balances these competing trends, providing the most favorable overall reaction pathway.

This structure-reactivity relationship highlights the importance of the local environment around the gallium species in determining the effectiveness of the alkyl mechanism in PDH reactions.

丙烷脱氢(PDH)在镓基催化剂上的烷基机理涉及几个关键步骤：

1. 初始CH活化：丙烷分子与镓活性位点相互作用，导致CH键断裂。这形成了GaC配位。

2. 烷基中间体形成：活化的丙烷形成与镓结合的烷基中间体物种。

3. β-氢消除：β-碳上的氢原子转移到镓上，形成GaH键并创建CC双键。

4. 产物脱附：形成的丙烯从催化剂表面脱附。

5. 催化剂再生：GaH物种释放H2，再生活性镓位点。

与碳正离子机理相比：
碳正离子机理在CH键活化后形成类似烷氧化物的中间体，而烷基机理形成直接的GaC键。碳正离子途径通过类碳正离子过渡态进行，而烷基机理在整个过程中保持更多的共价特性。

CH活化步骤被提出为速率决定步骤(RDS)，原因如下：
1. 它在反应序列中具有最高的活化能障。
2. 该步骤的计算活化能（39-40 kcal/mol）与实验观察结果非常接近。
3. 在更高温度下，与后续步骤相比，这个初始步骤在动力学上变得更加重要。

烷基机理对不同的Ga物种结构的应用：
1. 对于单位点[HGaH]+物种，烷基机理面临高活化能障，使其不太可能发生。
2. 对于靠近双Al位点的Ga物种（Z2[GaH]2+），烷基机理变得更有利。
3. 双Al位点中的AlAl距离显著影响烷基机理的能量学：
   - 较短的AlAl距离导致更高的CH活化能障，但较低的H2脱除能障。
   - 较长的AlAl距离导致较低的CH活化能障，但较高的H2脱除能障。
   - 约4.53 Å的最佳AlAl距离平衡了这些相互竞争的趋势，提供了最有利的整体反应途径。

这种结构-反应性关系突出了镓物种周围局部环境在决定PDH反应中烷基机理有效性方面的重要性。
