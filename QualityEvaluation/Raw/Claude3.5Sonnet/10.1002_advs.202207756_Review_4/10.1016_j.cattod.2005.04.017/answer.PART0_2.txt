[1] "We report a new, direct one-step dehydrogenation mechanism; however, we conclude in general that mono-Al sites in ZSM-5 are not likely responsible for alkane dehydrogentation, as calculated activation energies are too high compared to experimental values (60 kcal/mol versus 39 kcal/mol)."

[2] "We report a three-step mechanism for di-Al sites consisting of (1) CH activation, followed by (2) alkene desorption and (3) H2 removal."

[3] "For the mono-Al site, we report a new, direct one-step dehydrogenation mechanism; however, we conclude in general that mono-Al sites in ZSM-5 are not likely responsible for alkane dehydrogentation, as calculated activation energies are too high compared to experimental values (60 kcal/mol versus 39 kcal/mol)."

[4] "We find that as AlAl distance increases, the activation barrier for CH activation decreases (ranging from 85.72 to 38.38 to 19.69 kcal/mol), while the barrier for H2 removal increases (ranging from 15.49 to 36.71 to 47.38 kcal/mol)resulting in an optimal AlAl separation distance of 4.53 A arising from these competing trends."

[5] "Also, experimentally it has been observed [11,28] that propene is far more reactive than propane, and hence it was concluded that initial dehydrogenation is likely to be the rate-limiting step."

The alkyl mechanism for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) on gallium-based catalysts involves three key steps:

1. CH activation: This is the initial step where a CH bond in propane is broken, forming an alkyl intermediate bonded to the gallium species.

2. Alkene desorption: The alkyl intermediate then undergoes β-hydride elimination to form propene, which desorbs from the catalyst surface.

3. H2 removal: The final step involves the recombination and removal of hydrogen atoms to form H2, regenerating the active gallium site.

Compared to the carbenium mechanism, which involves the formation of a carbocation intermediate, the alkyl mechanism proceeds through a more covalent Ga-C bond intermediate. 

The CH activation step is proposed as the rate-determining step (RDS) for several reasons:
- It has the highest activation energy in most cases
- Experimental observations show propene is far more reactive than propane, suggesting the initial C-H bond breaking is the slowest step
- Subsequent steps like alkene desorption and H2 removal generally have lower barriers

The alkyl mechanism applies differently to various Ga species structures:

- For mono-Al sites (e.g. Z[HGaX]+), the calculated activation energies are too high (around 60 kcal/mol) compared to experimental values (39 kcal/mol), suggesting these sites are not likely responsible for dehydrogenation.

- For di-Al sites (Z2[GaH]2+), the mechanism is more favorable. The Al-Al distance plays a crucial role:
  - As Al-Al distance increases, the CH activation barrier decreases (from 85.72 to 19.69 kcal/mol)
  - However, the H2 removal barrier increases with Al-Al distance (from 15.49 to 47.38 kcal/mol)
  - An optimal Al-Al distance of 4.53 Å was found, balancing these competing trends

This structure-activity relationship highlights the importance of the local environment around the Ga species in determining catalytic activity for PDH reactions.

丙烷脱氢(PDH)反应在镓基催化剂上的烷基机理包括三个关键步骤：

1. CH活化：这是初始步骤，丙烷中的CH键断裂，形成与镓物种结合的烷基中间体。

2. 烯烃脱附：烷基中间体随后经过β-氢消除形成丙烯，并从催化剂表面脱附。

3. H2脱除：最后一步涉及氢原子的重组和脱除以形成H2，重新生成活性镓位点。

与涉及碳正离子中间体形成的碳正离子机理相比，烷基机理通过更具共价性的Ga-C键中间体进行。

CH活化步骤被提出为速率决定步骤(RDS)，原因如下：
- 在大多数情况下，它具有最高的活化能
- 实验观察表明丙烯比丙烷反应活性高得多，这表明初始C-H键断裂是最慢的步骤
- 随后的步骤如烯烃脱附和H2脱除通常具有较低的能垒

烷基机理对不同的Ga物种结构的应用不同：

- 对于单Al位点（例如Z[HGaX]+），计算的活化能太高（约60 kcal/mol），与实验值（39 kcal/mol）相比，表明这些位点不太可能负责脱氢。

- 对于双Al位点（Z2[GaH]2+），该机理更有利。Al-Al距离起着至关重要的作用：
  - 随着Al-Al距离的增加，CH活化能垒降低（从85.72降至19.69 kcal/mol）
  - 然而，H2脱除能垒随Al-Al距离增加而增加（从15.49增至47.38 kcal/mol）
  - 发现最佳Al-Al距离为4.53 Å，平衡了这些相互竞争的趋势

这种结构-活性关系突出了Ga物种周围局部环境在决定PDH反应催化活性中的重要性。
