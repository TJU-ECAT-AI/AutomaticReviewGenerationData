Read the questions and answers provided below. First, critically assess the overall relevance of the answers provided to the set of questions asked.

If, upon your assessment, you find that the answers do not contain information that is relevant to the questions asked, stop your review process immediately and respond with a single sentence: "※※※※※※※The provided answers are not relevant to the questions.※※※※※※※". Do not provide any additional explanation or background information, only this sentence should be given as a response in case of irrelevant answers.

If, however, the answers are relevant to the questions asked, proceed to compile answers for each question according to the instructions below. Ensure to aggregate all the relevant answers from the multiple answer results provided in the document, and organize them sequentially by their order number, compiling the corresponding quotes, English answers, and Chinese answers for each question.

If the provided answers' quotes are not differentiated by question, ensure to break them down and assign the quotes to each respective question, outputting them separately within each question's section.

To provide a comprehensive review, differentiate the responses into quotes, English answers, and Chinese answers for each question based on the details given in the 'Answer' XML tags. Structure your review using the XML format showcased below if the answers are relevant to the questions asked:

<questions>

Provide a comprehensive explanation of the alkyl mechanism in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions on gallium-based catalysts, detailing its key steps from initial propane activation to product formation. Compare this mechanism to the carbenium mechanism, discuss why the CH activation step is proposed as the rate-determining step (RDS), and explain how the alkyl mechanism applies to different Ga species structures.

Unfortunately, I cannot provide a comprehensive explanation of the alkyl mechanism in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions on gallium-based catalysts or compare it to the carbenium mechanism based on the given literature. The provided text appears to be only a partial citation of a scientific article and does not contain any relevant information about the mechanisms, steps, or rate-determining steps of propane dehydrogenation reactions. Without access to the full text or additional information, it is not possible to accurately answer the question or provide details about the alkyl mechanism, its key steps, comparison to the carbenium mechanism, or its application to different Ga species structures.

很遗憾，我无法根据所给的文献对镓基催化剂上丙烷脱氢(PDH)反应的烷基机理进行全面解释，也无法将其与碳正离子机理进行比较。所提供的文本似乎只是一篇科学文章的部分引文，不包含有关丙烷脱氢反应的机理、步骤或决速步骤的任何相关信息。在没有获得全文或额外信息的情况下，无法准确回答这个问题，也无法提供关于烷基机理、其关键步骤、与碳正离子机理的比较或其在不同镓物种结构上的应用的详细信息。

I apologize, but I cannot provide a comprehensive explanation of the alkyl mechanism in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions on gallium-based catalysts or compare it to the carbenium mechanism based on the given literature. The provided text appears to be only a partial citation of an article title and author list, without any detailed content about reaction mechanisms. There is insufficient information in the given text to address the specific questions about PDH reaction mechanisms, rate-determining steps, or how the mechanism applies to different Ga species structures.
