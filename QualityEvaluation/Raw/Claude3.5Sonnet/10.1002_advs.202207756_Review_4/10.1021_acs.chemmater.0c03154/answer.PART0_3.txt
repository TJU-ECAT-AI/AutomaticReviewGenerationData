<EnglishVersionAnswer>

The provided literature does not contain any information about the alkyl mechanism in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions on gallium-based catalysts. The text appears to be about aluminum in MFI zeolites and does not mention gallium catalysts, propane dehydrogenation, or the alkyl mechanism. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to the question based on this document.

提供的文献中没有关于镓基催化剂上丙烷脱氢(PDH)反应的烷基机理的信息。文本似乎是关于MFI沸石中的铝,并没有提到镓催化剂、丙烷脱氢或烷基机理。因此,我无法根据这份文件回答这个问题。
