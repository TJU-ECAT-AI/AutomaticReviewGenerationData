The given literature does not contain any information about propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions on gallium-based catalysts or the alkyl mechanism. The document appears to be about spectroscopic analysis of flaxseed subjected to heat treatment. It does not discuss catalytic reactions or mechanisms involving propane and gallium. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to the question based on the given literature.
