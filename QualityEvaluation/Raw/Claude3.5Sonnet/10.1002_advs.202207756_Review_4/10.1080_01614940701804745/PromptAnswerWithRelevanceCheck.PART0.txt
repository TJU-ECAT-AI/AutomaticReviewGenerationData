The alkyl mechanism for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) on gallium-based catalysts involves the following key steps:

1. Propane adsorption on a Ga site
2. C-H bond activation to form a Ga-alkyl intermediate 
3. β-hydride elimination to produce propene
4. Desorption of propene
5. Recombination and desorption of H2

The C-H activation step (step 2) is proposed as the rate-determining step. This differs from the carbenium mechanism which involves formation of a carbocation intermediate.

The alkyl mechanism is favored for Ga species because:

1. Ga can form stable alkyl intermediates
2. β-hydride elimination is facile on Ga 
3. Ga has lower electronegativity than zeolite Al sites, disfavoring carbocation formation

This mechanism likely applies to various Ga structures including isolated Ga3+ ions, GaO+ species, and small Ga2O3 clusters. The exact nature of the active site is still debated, but the general alkyl mechanism is thought to be operative regardless of the specific Ga species structure.

The alkyl pathway avoids carbocation intermediates, which can lead to undesired cracking reactions. This helps explain the improved selectivity to olefins observed with Ga-modified catalysts compared to acidic zeolites alone.

在含镓催化剂上进行丙烷脱氢(PDH)的烷基机理包括以下关键步骤：

1. 丙烷在镓位吸附
2. C-H键活化形成镓-烷基中间体
3. β-氢消除产生丙烯
4. 丙烯脱附
5. 氢气重组和脱附

C-H活化步骤(步骤2)被认为是速率决定步骤。这与涉及碳正离子中间体形成的碳正离子机理不同。

烷基机理在镓物种上更受青睐，原因如下：

1. 镓可以形成稳定的烷基中间体
2. β-氢消除在镓上容易进行
3. 镓的电负性低于沸石Al位，不利于碳正离子的形成

这种机理可能适用于各种镓结构，包括孤立的Ga3+离子、GaO+物种和小的Ga2O3簇。活性位点的确切性质仍有争议，但无论具体的镓物种结构如何，普遍认为通用的烷基机理是起作用的。

烷基途径避免了碳正离子中间体，后者可能导致不必要的裂解反应。这有助于解释与单独的酸性沸石相比，镓改性催化剂对烯烃的选择性提高的原因。

The given literature does not contain information specifically about the alkyl mechanism for propane dehydrogenation on gallium-based catalysts. The document focuses more broadly on propane aromatization over HZSM-5 and Ga/HZSM-5 catalysts, but does not go into detail about the alkyl mechanism or compare it to the carbenium mechanism for propane dehydrogenation. The rate-determining step and structures of different Ga species are also not discussed in relation to the alkyl mechanism in this text. To properly answer this question would require additional sources with more specific information about propane dehydrogenation mechanisms on gallium catalysts.

The alkyl mechanism for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) on gallium-based catalysts involves several key steps:

1. Propane adsorption: Propane adsorbs onto the gallium active sites.

2. C-H bond activation: A C-H bond in propane is activated by the gallium species, forming a Ga-alkyl intermediate and a Ga-H species. This step is proposed as the rate-determining step (RDS).

3. β-hydride elimination: The Ga-alkyl intermediate undergoes β-hydride elimination, forming propene and another Ga-H species.

4. Product desorption: Propene desorbs from the catalyst surface.

5. Hydrogen recombination: The two Ga-H species recombine to form H2, which then desorbs.

The alkyl mechanism differs from the carbenium mechanism in that it does not involve the formation of carbocations. Instead, it proceeds through organometallic Ga-alkyl intermediates.

The C-H activation step is proposed as the RDS because it involves breaking a strong C-H bond, which typically requires the highest activation energy in the overall reaction pathway. This step determines the overall reaction rate and is influenced by the nature of the Ga active sites.

The alkyl mechanism can apply to different Ga species structures, including isolated Ga3+ ions, small Ga2O3 clusters, and GaOx species. The specific structure of the Ga species affects the strength of the Ga-alkyl and Ga-H bonds, which in turn influences the reaction kinetics and selectivity. For example, isolated Ga3+ ions may form stronger Ga-alkyl bonds, potentially leading to higher selectivity but lower activity, while larger GaOx clusters might exhibit higher activity but lower selectivity due to weaker Ga-alkyl interactions.

丙烷脱氢(PDH)在镓基催化剂上的烷基机理包括几个关键步骤：

1. 丙烷吸附：丙烷吸附在镓活性位点上。

2. C-H键活化：丙烷中的一个C-H键被镓物种活化，形成Ga-烷基中间体和Ga-H物种。这一步被提出为速率决定步骤(RDS)。

3. β-氢消除：Ga-烷基中间体经历β-氢消除，形成丙烯和另一个Ga-H物种。

4. 产物脱附：丙烯从催化剂表面脱附。

5. 氢重组：两个Ga-H物种重组形成H2，然后脱附。

烷基机理与碳正离子机理的不同之处在于它不涉及碳正离子的形成。相反，它通过有机金属Ga-烷基中间体进行。

C-H活化步骤被提出为RDS，因为它涉及断裂强C-H键，这通常需要整个反应路径中最高的活化能。这一步决定了整体反应速率，并受到Ga活性位点性质的影响。

烷基机理可以应用于不同的Ga物种结构，包括孤立的Ga3+离子、小的Ga2O3簇和GaOx物种。Ga物种的具体结构影响Ga-烷基和Ga-H键的强度，进而影响反应动力学和选择性。例如，孤立的Ga3+离子可能形成更强的Ga-烷基键，可能导致更高的选择性但活性较低，而较大的GaOx簇可能表现出更高的活性但由于Ga-烷基相互作用较弱而选择性较低。
