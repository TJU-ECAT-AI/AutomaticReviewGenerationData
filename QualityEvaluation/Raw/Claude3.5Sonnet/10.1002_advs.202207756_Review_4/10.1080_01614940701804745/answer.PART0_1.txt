The given literature does not contain information specifically about the alkyl mechanism for propane dehydrogenation on gallium-based catalysts. The document focuses more broadly on propane aromatization over HZSM-5 and Ga/HZSM-5 catalysts, but does not go into detail about the alkyl mechanism or compare it to the carbenium mechanism for propane dehydrogenation. The rate-determining step and structures of different Ga species are also not discussed in relation to the alkyl mechanism in this text. To properly answer this question would require additional sources with more specific information about propane dehydrogenation mechanisms on gallium catalysts.

给定的文献没有包含关于镓基催化剂上丙烷脱氢反应的烷基机理的具体信息。该文档更广泛地关注了HZSM-5和Ga/HZSM-5催化剂上的丙烷芳构化,但没有详细讨论丙烷脱氢的烷基机理或将其与碳正离子机理进行比较。文中也没有讨论与烷基机理相关的速率决定步骤和不同Ga物种结构。要正确回答这个问题需要额外的资料来源,以提供更多关于镓催化剂上丙烷脱氢机理的具体信息。
