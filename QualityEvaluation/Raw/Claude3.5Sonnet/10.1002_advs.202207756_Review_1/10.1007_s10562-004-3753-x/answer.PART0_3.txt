[1] "The structure of the active intrazeolite Ga species and their reactivity in oxidative and reductive conditions has not been fully resolved yet, owing to the wide variety of possible structures including bulk Ga2O3 aggregates on the external zeolite surface, small gallium oxide aggregates occluded in the zeolite micropore space, reduced Ga species such as Ga2O and cationic Ga species in oxidized or reduced form."

[2] "A previous Ga K edge XAS study [10] indicated that the oxidation state of the reduced Ga species changes upon cooling indicating that in situ studies at relatively high temperatures are a prerequisite."

[3] "Therefore, we studied the catalytic materials by XANES under conditions relevant to catalysis."

The primary challenges in elucidating Ga speciation in Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts under propane dehydrogenation (PDH) conditions include:

1. The wide variety of possible Ga structures, ranging from bulk Ga2O3 aggregates on the external zeolite surface to small gallium oxide aggregates in the micropores, and various reduced Ga species.

2. The dynamic nature of Ga species, as their oxidation state can change with temperature.

In situ or operando characterization techniques, such as XANES, contribute to overcoming these challenges by:

1. Allowing the study of catalytic materials under conditions relevant to catalysis, including high temperatures.

2. Providing information on the oxidation state and local structure of Ga species during reaction conditions.

3. Enabling the observation of dynamic changes in Ga speciation that may not be captured by ex situ techniques.

These techniques advance our understanding of structure-activity relationships by correlating the observed Ga species with catalytic performance under realistic reaction conditions, helping to identify the truly active forms of Ga in the catalyst.

在丙烷脱氢（PDH）条件下阐明Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂中Ga物种的主要挑战包括：

1. Ga结构的多样性，从外部沸石表面的块状Ga2O3聚集体到微孔中的小型氧化镓聚集体，以及各种还原态Ga物种。

2. Ga物种的动态性质，因为它们的氧化态可能随温度变化。

原位或操作条件下表征技术（如XANES）通过以下方式有助于克服这些挑战：

1. 允许在与催化相关的条件下研究催化材料，包括高温条件。

2. 提供反应条件下Ga物种的氧化态和局部结构信息。

3. 能够观察到可能无法通过非原位技术捕捉到的Ga物种的动态变化。

这些技术通过将观察到的Ga物种与实际反应条件下的催化性能相关联，有助于识别催化剂中真正活性的Ga形态，从而推进我们对结构-活性关系的理解。
