[1] "The structure of the active intrazeolite Ga species and their reactivity in oxidative and reductive conditions has not been fully resolved yet, owing to the wide variety of possible structures including bulk Ga2O3 aggregates on the external zeolite surface, small gallium oxide aggregates occluded in the zeolite micropore space, reduced Ga species such as Ga2O and cationic Ga species in oxidized or reduced form."

[2] "A previous Ga K edge XAS study [10] indicated that the oxidation state of the reduced Ga species changes upon cooling indicating that in situ studies at relatively high temperatures are a prerequisite."

[3] "Here, we report an in situ X-ray absorption near-edge spectroscopy (XANES) study of the thermal activation of these species."

The primary challenges in elucidating Ga speciation in Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts under propane dehydrogenation (PDH) conditions include:

1. The wide variety of possible Ga structures, ranging from bulk Ga2O3 aggregates on the external zeolite surface to small gallium oxide aggregates in the micropores, and reduced Ga species in various forms.

2. The dynamic nature of Ga species, as their oxidation state can change with temperature.

In situ or operando characterization techniques, such as X-ray absorption near-edge spectroscopy (XANES), contribute to overcoming these challenges by:

1. Allowing the study of Ga species under conditions relevant to catalysis, including high temperatures.

2. Providing real-time information on the oxidation state and local structure of Ga species during thermal activation and reaction conditions.

These techniques advance our understanding of structure-activity relationships by enabling the observation of Ga speciation changes under realistic reaction conditions, which is crucial for identifying the true active species and understanding their role in the catalytic process.
