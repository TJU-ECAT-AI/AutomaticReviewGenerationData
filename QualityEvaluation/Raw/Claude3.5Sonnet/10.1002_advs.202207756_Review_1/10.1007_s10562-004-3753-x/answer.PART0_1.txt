[1] "The structure of the active intrazeolite Ga species and their reactivity in oxidative and reductive conditions has not been fully resolved yet, owing to the wide variety of possible structures including bulk Ga2O3 aggregates on the external zeolite surface, small gallium oxide aggregates occluded in the zeolite micropore space, reduced Ga species such as Ga2O and cationic Ga species in oxidized or reduced form."

[2] "A previous Ga K edge XAS study [10] indicated that the oxidation state of the reduced Ga species changes upon cooling indicating that in situ studies at relatively high temperatures are a prerequisite."

[3] "Therefore, we studied the catalytic materials by XANES under conditions relevant to catalysis."

The primary challenges in elucidating Ga speciation in Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts under propane dehydrogenation (PDH) conditions include:

1. The wide variety of possible Ga structures, including bulk Ga2O3 aggregates, small gallium oxide aggregates in micropores, and various reduced and oxidized Ga species.

2. The dynamic nature of Ga species, as their oxidation state can change with temperature.

In situ or operando characterization techniques contribute to overcoming these challenges by:

1. Allowing the study of catalytic materials under conditions relevant to catalysis, such as high temperatures.

2. Providing real-time information on the structure and oxidation state of Ga species during reaction conditions.

3. Enabling the observation of dynamic changes in Ga speciation that may not be captured by ex situ techniques.

These techniques advance our understanding of structure-activity relationships by correlating the observed Ga species with catalytic performance under realistic reaction conditions, helping to identify the truly active forms of Ga in the catalyst.

在丙烷脱氢(PDH)条件下阐明Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂中Ga物种的主要挑战包括：

1. Ga结构的多样性，包括体相Ga2O3聚集体、微孔中的小型氧化镓聚集体，以及各种还原态和氧化态的Ga物种。

2. Ga物种的动态特性，因为它们的氧化态会随温度变化。

原位或操作条件下表征技术通过以下方式有助于克服这些挑战：

1. 允许在与催化相关的条件下（如高温）研究催化材料。

2. 提供反应条件下Ga物种结构和氧化态的实时信息。

3. 能够观察到可能无法通过非原位技术捕捉的Ga物种的动态变化。

这些技术通过将观察到的Ga物种与实际反应条件下的催化性能相关联，有助于识别催化剂中真正活性的Ga形态，从而推进我们对结构-活性关系的理解。
