The interaction of H2 with Ga/SiO2, Pd/SiO2, and GaPd/SiO2
catalysts has been investigated by in situ X-ray photoelectron and
transmission infrared spectroscopies (XPS and FTIR). The precur-
sors, calcined in dry air at 673 K, yield PdO and Ga2O3. Upon ex-
posure to hydrogen reduction at 423 K, the fraction of reduced gal-
lium ions (Gaδ+ cations, δ < 2) was 16% on Ga-promoted Pd/SiO2,
whereas no Ga3+ was reduced over Ga/SiO2 materials. It is sug-
gested that this promotional reduction effect of the noble metal
over gallium(III) is accomplished through hydrogen spillover from
metallic palladium, early reduced at 423 K. Higher reduction tem-
peratures (723 K) lead to highly dispersed metallic palladium
crystallites on the catalysts surface, and to the reduction of about
2328% of the total gallium content in both the Ga/SiO2 and the Ga
Pd/SiO2 materials. Above 473 K and under hydrogen flow, a band
at 2020 cm1 developed over all these reduced gallium-containing
catalysts, which was assigned to Gaδ+H bond stretching. A linear
relationship was found between the intensity of this infrared signal
and the total gallium or Gaδ+ loading over the catalysts, at 723 K
and 760 Torr of flowing H2. We propose that galliumhydrogen
bond formation can be achieved on Ga/SiO2 by heterolytic hydro-
gen dissociation on the Gaδ+ cations, which are stabilized on the
silica surface, to yield additional GaOH bonds. In the GaPd/SiO2
catalysts the process is further aided by the metal particles. The
Gaδ+H species were unstable below 450 K and/or decomposed un-
der evacuation but could be immediately regenerated after restoring
H2 pressure. The impact of the formation of this galliumhydrogen
bond over the hydrogenation of carbon dioxide to oxygenated com-
pounds is also discussed.

INTRODUCTION
The catalytic properties of gallium have received re-
newed attention from the mid-1980s. For example, there
has been steadily growing interest in the investigation of
the nature of the active sites on ZSM-5 zeolites modified
with gallium, because aromatization of light alkanes can be

accomplished by these catalysts (15). Discussions of re-
search teams go from the role of Ga atoms or GaOx oxides
in the lattice on the depression of the protonic acidity of the
zeolite to the formation of active forms of reduced gallium,
such as Ga(I) or GaHx monomeric species (610).
More recently, deep effects on the catalytic properties
for achieving highly effective conversion of carbon dioxide
to valuable compounds using composite catalysts which in-
corporate gallium oxide(s) and precious metals have been
reported (1113). Inui concluded that the reduced state of
those catalysts that showed optimum catalytic properties
could be controlled by a combination of direct and inverse
hydrogen spillover from the noble metal and gallium sites,
respectively (11). The development of an active Pd/Ga2O3
catalysts for the synthesis of methanol from CO2 hy-
drogenation, able to compete with the classical Cu/ZnO
formulation, was first reported by Fujitani et al. (12). Later
on, Bonivardi et al. showed that gallium addition to Pd/
SiO2 catalysts produced a dramatic enhancement of the
catalytic performance to give oxygenated compounds from
the hydrogenation of carbon dioxide (13): Going from pure
Pd/SiO2 to Ga-promoted Pd/SiO2, with a variable Ga-to-Pd
atomic ratio, the initial activity to methanol improved from
1.7 × 103 to 4.5 × 101 s1 at 523 K and 3 MPa (CO2/H2).
Under the same reaction conditions, the initial selectivity to
methanol went up to 62% for one of the gallium-promoted
catalysts, compared to 17% over clean palladium/silica.
Based on preliminary results of temperature-programmed
reduction, these last authors proposed that palladium crys-
tallites interacting with reduced gallium species could ac-
count for the unusual catalytic performance of the GaPd/
SiO2 system. A mechanism involving intermediates from
adsorbed CO2 rather than CO, similar to those sustained
for Cu/ZnO, was suggested since only traces of methanol
were synthesized from CO/H2 mixtures.
The impact of hydrogen activation in the hydrogenation
of carbon oxides over these gallium-containing catalysts
was not discussed in the mentioned works, probably
because Ga is not as good a hydrogenation catalyst as the
noble metals are and, actually, is not a widely employed
catalytic element (1113). In like manner, although it is

well-known that zinc oxide is able to activate dissociatively
the hydrogen molecule (1416), this point has not been
further emphasized or considered in studies of methanol
synthesis on the traditional Cu/ZnO catalysts, as it has been
in the case of propane dehydrocyclization on Ga/HZMS-5
(710).
In this context, it is imperative to balance the knowl-
edge of the chemistry of all the elemental components of a
catalytic material, starting from molecular activation pro-
cesses. Thus, the aim of this work is to furnish evidence of
the chemistry of gallium species under reducing conditions
in the hope that it will help in understanding the reaction
pathways to oxygenated compounds from CO2 and H2. For
this purpose, we report here our results on hydrogen inter-
action with Ga/SiO2 and GaPd/SiO2 materials, followed
by XPS and FTIR spectroscopies.
EXPERIMENTAL
Catalysts
Davison Grade 59 silica gel (W. R. Grace) was previ-
ously crushed and sieved through an 80-mesh Tyler screen.
Next, the silica was purified, calcined in air at 773 K for
12 h, and characterized before being used as support for
the catalysts, as described in (17) (average particle diam-
eter = 52 m; specific surface = 301 m2/g; average pore
diameter = 16 nm).
Catalysts with 2 wt% Pd loading were obtained via ion
exchange of palladium acetate (Sigma, 99.97%), at pH 11
in NH4OH(aq), onto the support. The exchanged material
was washed at the same pH, and the supported tetrammine
palladium complex was decomposed to diammine palla-
dium on silica by drying at 423 K for 2 h under flowing
air (200 cm3/min), in a glass reactor (18). Then, different
amounts of Ga(NO3)3 · xH2O (Strem Chemicals, 99.99%
Ga), in aqueous solution, were added by incipient wetness
impregnation to the [Pd(NH3)2]2+/SiO2 at 3 Torr of N2
(1 Torr = 133.3 Pa) and ambient temperature, in a rotary
evaporator. Subsequently, the solids were frozen in liquid
nitrogen and water was removed by sublimation at 3 Torr
of N2 to give dry precursors. The resulting precursors were
then calcined in flowing air (200 cm3/min) by heating from
298 to 673 K (2 h) at 2 K/min, to obtain palladium and gal-
lium oxides on the SiO2 surface (calcined catalysts). Last,
portions of each calcined catalyst were reduced in a 5%
H2/Ar mixture (200 cm3/min), heating from 298 to 723 K
(2 h) at 2 K/min, to obtain the prereduced catalysts. Be-
fore removing these reduced catalysts from the glass reac-
tor, they were passivated at 298 K by flowing O2/Ar mix-
tures (200 cm3/min) with increasing O2 content, from 0.1 to
5% v/v. Blank samples of gallium/silica and palladium/silica
were also prepared following the same procedure.

features of the reduced samples used in this work. The

specific surface area of the catalysts was measured by the
BET method (N2), in a Micromeritics Acusorb 2000 appa-
ratus. The fraction of exposed metallic palladium was deter-
mined by chemisorption of carbon monoxide pulses. Non-
chemisorbed CO was hydrogenated to methane, which was
then detected by a flame ionization detector, as described
in (19). A JEOL 100 CX electron microscope operating in
the bright-field mode was used to perform TEM character-
ization. X-ray diffraction spectrometry was employed over
a selected set of the catalysts, using a RichSeifert JSO-
Debyeflex 2002 diffractometer equipped with a Ni-filtered
Cu Kα radiation source.
XPS Apparatus and Procedures
Samples of either precursors or prereduced catalysts
were ground and placed on a metallic sample holder. The
samples were treated in situ in a pretreatment chamber. The
precursors were first calcined at 673 K in 400 Torr of static
O2 for 30 min and were sequentially reduced in situ at 423,
573, and 723 K in 400 Torr of static H2, for 30 min each time.
The prereduced catalysts were re-reduced in situ at 523 K,
under the same final conditions. After each treatment, the
samples were degassed and directly transferred without ex-
posure to air to an attached XPS analysis chamber. A VG
Escalab 200R X-ray photoelectron spectrometer with a Mg
Kα1,2 source (incident energy of 1253.6 eV) and a hemi-
spherical electron analyzer was used. The residual pressure
in the ion-pumped analysis chamber was maintained below
3 × 109 Torr during data acquisition. C 1s, O 1s, O 2s, Ga
3d, Si 2p, Pd 3d, Ga 3d, and Ga LMM signals were recorded.
The electron-binding-energy scale was calibrated by as-
signing 532.6 eV to the O 1s peak. The binding energies
reported here are accurate to 0.1 eV, with the exception
254

of the energy values for Pd 3d and Ga LMM signals, which
are within a 0.3 eV error owing to their lower signal-to-
noise ratios.
The acquired spectra were processed with Microcal
Origin 4.1 and the XPSPEAK 4.0 programs, as fol-
lows: A smoothing of the peaks was achieved using FFT,
then a Shirley background was subtracted, and a Gaussian
Lorentzian sum function was used for fitting. XPS rela-
tive surface composition was calculated from photoelectron
peak areas after deconvolution.
FT-IR Studies
Catalysts samples were pressed into wafers of 10 mg/cm2
at 5 ton/cm2. Previously, it was verified that the specific
surface area of the catalysts is not decreased by this treat-
ment. These self-supported wafers were placed in turn
into a Pyrex cell with water-cooled NaCl windows, which
was attached to a conventional high vacuum system (base
pressure = 106 Torr), equipped with a manifold for gas
flow. All catalysts pretreatments and IR measurements
(transmission mode) were performed in situ at 760 Torr,
except during evacuation.
Samples of the prereduced catalyst were heated form
298 to 723 K under O2 flow (100 cm3/min, 5 K/min) and
promptly cooled to 343 K under vacuum. Next, H2 was ad-
mitted into the cell (100 cm3/min) and the temperature was
increased to 723 K (5 K/min). After 30 min at this last con-
dition the cell was evacuated for 20 min at 723 K. Then,
the temperature was gradually decreased under vacuum to
allow for reference IR spectra of the clean wafers to be
taken, for reference background subtraction. It is impor-
tant to emphasize that the prereduced catalysts had to be
first oxidized under flowing oxygen to remove any remain-
ing bands in the 3000- to 2800-cm1 region. These spurious
bands usually appear as a consequence of adventitious oil
coming from the process of wafer preparation and they are
attributed to the CH stretching modes of CHx groups.
A selected set of prereduced samples was first cleaned
as described before and then gradually reduced from 298
to 723 K under flowing H2 (100 cm3/min, 5 K/min). After
15 min at this last condition a mixture of H2/D2 = 1/1 v/v
(100 cm3/min) was admitted into the IR cell for 15 min and,
finally, the gas flow was switched to pure D2 for another
15 min (100 cm3/min). Reference spectra were taken after
20 min of evacuation at 723 K.
Finally, a sample of the calcined PdGa80 catalyst was
treated in flowing H2 (100 cm3/min) after evacuating the
cell for 15 min, as follows: (i) heating from 298 to 723 K
(5 K/min); (ii) cooling, immediately, to 343 K (3 K/min);
(iii) heating from 343 to 723 K (5 K/min); (iv) evacuating to
the base pressure, for 20 min, at 723 K; and, finally, (v) cool-
ing to room temperature. Again, IR spectra of the clean
wafer were taken under this last cooling process for back-
ground subtraction.
A shimadzu 8210 FT-IR spectrometer with a DLATGS
detector was used to collect the transmission spectra at
4-cm1 resolution (100 scans). The Microcal Origin 4.1
software (with Peak fitting module) was employed to cor-
rect the background spectra at each temperature and to
measure peak areas and/or intensities.
Gases
AGA ultrahigh-purity grade H2 (99.999%) and Ar
(99.999%), research grade O2 (99.999%), and high-purity
N2 (99.998%) were further purified prior to use. Hydrogen,
argon, and nitrogen were passed through molecular sieve
traps (3-A Fisher) and MnO/Al2O3 cartridges to remove
water and oxygen impurities. Oxygen was passed through a
molecular sieve trap (3-A Fisher) and Ascarite to remove
water and carbon dioxide, respectively.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Effect of the Hydrogen Reduction on Pd
and Ga Oxidation States
Table 2 summarizes the binding energy (BE) and kinetic
energy (KE) values of the most relevant palladium and gal-
lium signals, as a function of sample composition, for the
treatments described under Experimental. As an example,
the smoothened XPS spectra of Si 2p, Pd 3d, O 2s, and Ga
3d core levels and the Ga LMM Auger signal are illustrated
in Fig. 1 for the PdGa40 precursor reduced in situ at 523 K.
For silicon, the Si 2p peak for all the samples and after
each treatment was, within the experimental error, char-
acteristic of SiO2 (BE 
= 103.1 eV, FWHM 
= 2.4 eV) (20).
Palladium 3d5/2 BE values for our catalysts calcined at
673 K were assigned to palladium(II) cations according
to reference data (20, 22). It is well-known that metallic
palladium binding energy values consistently larger than
that of the bulk metal are obtained when metal crystallites
smaller than approximately 4 nm are deposited on the sur-
face of an insulator (2225). Thus, Pd 3d5/2 peak positions
for the catalysts reduced at T 573 K, BE = 335.8336.4 eV,
correspond to ultradispersed, reduced palladium particles.
A mixture of Pd0 and Pd2+ was obtained over the clean
or gallium-promoted Pd/SiO2 at the lowest reduction tem-
perature (423 K), at variance with our hydrogen-flowing
temperature-programmed reduction (TPR) results, which
indicated the complete reduction of Pd at 423 K (13). This
disagreement might be due to an insufficient H2 supply in
the XPS pretreatment chamber and/or to a difference (esti-
mated in about 50 K) between the measured temperatures
of the catalysts sample under both diverse reduction treat-
ments, as it is well-known that supported palladium oxide
readily reduces at 393 K (26).
It is important to recall, now, that the average diameter of
the palladium metal particles measured by TEM was almost

identical for the whole set of the prereduced catalysts, in
contrast with the decrease of the exposed metal fraction
(FE) in the preparations where the gallium content was
progressively increased (see Table 1). Concurrently with
the TEM measurements, no trend was detected either for
anychemicalshiftofthePd3dsignalaccompanyingahigher
loading of the promoter on the Pd/silica catalyst. Thus, an
impact over the Pd chemical shift owing to the coverage of
the palladium crystallites by gallium species cannot be seen
by XPS. As a consequence, the reported Pd 3d5/2 BE values
for Pd0 in Table 2 should be consider indistinguishable.
The effects of the high-temperature reduction treatments
over the supported gallium oxide appear fairly well in the
XPS spectra: So, two shoulders for the Ga 3d core-level
signal, which are partially overlapped with the O 2s photo-
electron peak, can be already individualized upon reducing
the PdGa40 precursor at 573 K (Fig. 1). More explicitly, the
deconvoluted peaks of the O 2s and Ga 3d photoelectron
lines for the Ga80 and PdGa80 precursors reduced at 723 K
are shown on the rough XPS spectra in Fig. 2.
The most important feature to be emphasized is that the
presence of these two Ga 3d lines, from now on defined as
the high- and low-binding-energy components (HBE and
LBE, respectively) of the Ga 3d signal, was consistently
observed in all the gallium-containing catalysts that had
been reduced at least once at 723 K.
It is clear that the calcination pretreatment of the cata-
lyst precursors at 673 K produced only gallium(III) oxide
on the silica, since bulk gallium nitrate thermally decom-
poses to Ga2O3 above 523 K (27). Hence, the high-energy
peak (HBE) located at approximately 20.8 eV is assigned to
supported Ga3+ species on the calcined materials, whether
Ga/SiO2 or GaPd/SiO2 (see Table 2).
After reduction in hydrogen at 723 K a new Ga 3d signal
appeared at lower energy (LBE) at 19.6 eV for Ga/SiO2.
Separated TPR experiments indicated that incomplete re-
duction of Ga3+ on supported gallium on SiO2 took place
under similar conditions (13). Indeed, hydrogen-reduced
bulk Ga2O3 and mechanical mixtures or impregnated
ZSM-5 zeolite with Ga2O3 have yielded conclusive evi-
dence of the partial reduction of gallium(III) species to
probably Ga1+ cations (2830). Upon reduction, the low-
energy Ga 3d peak was also present on the gallium-
promoted palladium catalysts, but it became visible at
earlier temperatures, from 423 K onward, coincidentally
with our previous TPR experiments. This last result is in

complete agreement with the suggested Pt promotion ef-
fect on the reduction of gallium(III) in PtGa2O3/ZSM-5
by Shpiro et al. (29).
Other alternatives that might account for the appearance
of the LBE band in our reduced GaPd/SiO2 materials are
the formation of metallic gallium and/or PdGa alloy, which
cannot be ruled out completely for at least three reasons:
(i) the chemical shift from Ga1+ (Ga2O) to Ga0 (metallic
gallium) is only 0.3 eV, (ii) alloy formation could induce
an additional chemical shift, and (iii) partial overlapping of
the Ga 3d signal with O 2s peak introduces supplementary
errors in the measurements of peak positions.
Although XPS detection of small amounts of this pre-
sumed alloy would be very difficult, there are two points
that allow us to believe that gallium(III) species were not
totally reduced to metallic gallium. First, because it is hard
to think of a reduction from Ga3+ to Ga0 at temperatures
as low as 423 K in the GaPd/SiO2 catalysts, as this process
needs much higher temperatures (27) and, second, because
the LBE signal have the same position for Ga/SiO2 and for
Ga-promoted Pd/SiO2 catalysts.
It is then logical to conclude that the Ga 3d LBE compo-
nent of all our catalytic systems corresponds to Gaδ+ species
(δ < 2) originated from supported Ga2Ox (x < 2), probably
Ga1+ or gallium suboxide, Ga2O.
It is interesting that the Ga 3d BE reference values for
bulk gallium compounds, given in Table 2, are slightly lower
than those for supported gallium species, but the opposite
is true for KE Ga LMM signal. Although size effects in
X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy have not been reported

for metal oxide particles, it has been proved that the de-
veloping of a TiO2SiO2 interface produces an up- and
downshiftintheTi2pXPSpeakandtheTiAugerparameter
(α = BETi 2p + KETi LMV) (3136), respectively. In our ma-
terials, regardless of the composition and treatment of the
samples, average chemical shift (
BE) and Auger parame-
ter shift (
α) for gallium, of +0.3 and 1.0 eV, respectively
(mainly produced by oxidized gallium, even under reducing
conditions), with respect to bulk Ga2O3, can be calculated
from Table 2.
The values of these shifts indicate changes in the extra-
atomic relaxation energy rather than a variation of the ini-
tial state, when supporting gallium oxide (37, 38). In princi-
ple, differences in relaxation could be produced by crystal
size and/or support effects. In our case, it is reasonable to
expect that gallium species are mostly dispersed over the
support, as a consequence of the impregnation and drying
procedures used to prepare the samples (see next section).
Furthermore, the occurrence of slightly higher BE values
and lower Auger parameters for gallium oxides deposited
over an insulator, compared to those for bulk gallium ox-
ides, are consistent. It is possible to think, too, that at least
a part of the gallium species are interacting via intimate
contact with the support.
As for Si 2p photoelectron line, the O 2s peak was typical
of silicon oxide (BE 
= 25.0 eV, FWHM 
= 4.2 eV) (20). We
can then consider that the contribution from gallium oxides
to this signal was negligible.
Quantification of the extent of Pd and Ga reduction
was done after deconvoluting the Pd 3d and Ga 3d sig-
nals. The percentages of reduced Pd and Ga, defined as
[Pd0/(Pd0 + Pd2+)] × 100 and [Gaδ+/(Gaδ+ + Ga3+)] × 100,
respectively, are reported in Table 2.
As expected, palladium(II) was fully reduced to metallic
palladium upon heating either the calcined catalyst precur-
sors or the prereduced Pd/SiO2 or GaPd/SiO2 catalysts in
400 Torr of H2 at 723 K, but the former materials (i.e., the
calcined precursors) showed only partial reduction of the
noble metal upon exposure to lower reduction tempera-
tures. In fact, as was highlighted earlier, supported palla-
dium oxide on silica can be completely transformed into
finely dispersed metal particles under flowing hydrogen at
temperatures as low as 423 K (13, 26). Again, an estimated
difference of roughly 50 K between the real temperature of
the catalysts pellets and the temperature measured by the
thermocouple inside the XPS pretreatment chamber might
well account for the apparent partial reduction of palladium
in the precursors at this low-temperature reduction condi-
tion. Yet, the very close percentages of reduced palladium
on PdGa00 (72%) and PdGa80 (66%) allow us to conclude
that the presence of gallium had negligible effects over Pd
reduction.
This was not quite true for the case of gallium. Dis-
persed gallium sesquioxide on silica was partially reduced
to Ga2Ox to different percentages depending on the reduc-
tion temperature and/or whether palladium was present
or not. For PdGa80 a fraction of the gallium total (16%)
was already reduced to Gaδ+ at 423 K, while for Ga80 no
gallium (δ+) species could be detected by XPS under this
low-temperature reduction condition. The increase of the
temperature to 723 K allowed further Ga2Ox formation on
both the Ga/SiO2 and GaPd/SiO2 catalysts, but the per-
centage of reduced gallium (Gaδ+) was never higher than
about a third of the total, using either precursors or the
prereduced catalysts (span, 2331%; Table 2).
An explanation of this promoting effect of palladium
on the reduction of gallium(III) oxide could arise by tak-
ing into account hydrogen spillover. Palladium oxide starts
reducing on silica at very low temperatures, lower than
373 K (26). The tiny metal crystallites that are formed in
this first step are able to dissociate hydrogen molecules.
Chemisorbed hydrogen atoms on Pd0 spill over and re-
duce the closer Ga3+ cations at or above 423 K. However,
this process needs further heating on the calcined Ga/SiO2,
since hydrogen activation of Ga2Ox takes place at higher
temperatures, as is discussed below.
Concerning the aggregation state of the active compo-
nents of our catalysts, XRD experiments over prereduced
catalysts of the highest gallium loading (Ga80 and PdGa80)
confirmed the absence of palladium, galliumpalladium al-
loy, or gallium oxides particles bigger than 4 nm. Nishi et al.
prepared SiO2-supported Ga2O3 samples by impregnation
ofsilicawithanaqueoussolutionofgalliumnitratefollowed
by evaporation and calcination in air at 823 K for 4 h (39).
From 1.5 to 10.0 wt% Ga content, the size of their Ga2O3-
supported particles, estimated by TEM, was between 2.0
and 6.2 nm. The existence of the poorly ordered ε-Ga2O3

peaks for gallium loading higher than 4.8 wt%, whereas
amorphous gallium oxide prevailed for lower gallium con-
tents (39). Hence, by no means do our XRD results con-
tradict the data of Nishi and coworkers, since more drastic
drying and calcination conditions were used in their ex-
periments. We conclude, then, that finely dispersed mixed
gallium oxides and/or metallic palladium are spread over
the silica support on each of our reduced catalysts.
GalliumHydrogen Bond Formation as Detected
by IR Spectroscopy
After exposing the prereduced gallium and gallium
palladium-containing catalysts to flowing hydrogen at
343 K, a low-intensity, broad IR bond at 3000 cm1 together
with an overlapped band corresponding to the ν(OH) band
of interacting silanol groups via hydrogen bonding over the
catalysts, at approximately 3550 cm1, were immediately
formed. The source of these hydroxyl bands is mainly as-
cribed to water formation, from the reduction of palladium
and gallium oxides which were produced during the clean-
ing process (oxidation step).
The intensity of the band at 3000 cm1 increased with the
total gallium loading on the catalysts, and it was absent on
unpromoted Pd/SiO2. Due to its proximity to the hydroxyl
stretching bands, it was assigned to the stretching mode of
interacting hydroxyl groups on the surface of gallium oxide
particles.
Those ν(OH) bands, and the δ(OH) band at 1630 cm1,
disappeared simultaneously after heating in hydrogen, as
water was removed from the surface of the materials. Once
at 723 K, it was possible to observe only a band at 3670 cm1
in the gallium-containing catalysts (Fig. 3). Still, it was dif-

ficult to follow its evolution at temperatures lower than
700 K, due to its superposition with SiOH bands. The band
at 3670 cm1 was assigned to the OH stretching mode in
GaOH or SiO(H)Ga, in agreement with other reported
values (4042). We assumed that this band is involved in
the development or evolution of the main infrared signal at
2020 cm1, discussed in the following paragraphs.
Figure 4 shows the formation of an infrared band at ap-
proximately 2020 cm1 on prereduced GaPd/SiO2 with
the highest total gallium content (PdGa80), upon heating
the catalyst under flowing hydrogen. This band could be
reliably measured against the background above approxi-
mately 500 K (2027 cm1). Its intensity grew up until 660 K
and then leveled off at higher temperatures (2015 cm1).
A comparison of the intensity of this band with total gal-
lium loading on Ga/SiO2 and GaPd/SiO2 catalysts at 723 K
under hydrogen is shown in Fig. 5. This figure discloses that
Pd/SiO2 is unable to form the surface species or bond re-
sponsible for the band at 2020 cm1. As for the other cata-
lysts, it can be readily inferred that the only requisite for its
development is the presence of gallium, because the band
intensity is proportional to the Ga weight loading. Irrespec-
tiveofthepalladiumcontent,thebandpositionshiftedfrom
2026 to 2015 cm1 as the gallium loading went from 2.6 to

however, it was extremely relevant to pay close attention to

this spectral region, which was accomplished by means of
designated experiments, using H2, D2, and their mixtures,
as discussed next.
The origin of the 2020-cm1 band was attributed to
galliumhydrogen bond formation and was assigned to the
stretching mode of Gaδ+H, ν(GaH). Three aspects of all
spectra we judge to be critical to the unambiguous iden-
tification of this assignment. The first one is related to
the wavenumber position of this band when compared to
molecular model systems, the second one to the relation-
ship between the content of Gaδ+ species and the intensity
of the ν(GaH) band, and the last to the wavenumber posi-
tion of the peaks when performing HD isotopic exchange
experiments, as follows:
(i) The infrared spectra of pure and nonpure gallanes
show different GaH bands, e.g., stretching, bending,
torsion, and combination modes. Of those modes, only
one stretching mode arises at wavenumbers higher than
1300 cm1, i.e., in our transparent region of infrared spec-
tra, and this mode belongs, in particular, to a terminal Ga
H bond, ν(GaHterminal) or, hereafter, ν(GaH) (4350).
Table 3 summarizes the infrared band positions for this last
mode in model systems. It shows that the ν(GaH) mode for
gallanes lies between 2050 and 1800 cm1. Then, if Gaδ+H
is formed by reacting Ga2Ox with hydrogen in our cata-
lysts, no more than one band would be expected to show up
at a wavenumber higher than 1800 cm1 in our diagnostic
region, as it is found.
Meriaudeau and Primet attributed their IR signal at
2020cm1 toGaHspeciesoverpartiallyreducedα-Ga2O3,
which is identical to our result regarding this infrared peak
(40). To our knowledge, these authors reported the first and
onlyevidencebyadirectmethodofgalliumhydrogenbond
formation on a material surface, which we corroborate on
the surface of our catalysts.
(ii) The evolutions of the 2020-cm1 peak intensity for all
our prereduced catalysts versus temperature increase are
displayed in Fig. 6. This band developed gradually while
the temperature was raised, over both the Ga/SiO2 and
the GaPd/SiO2 catalysts. Then the band height flattened,
from 660 K onward, keeping its maximum intensity value.
This final intensity value (T > 653 K) increased with total
gallium content in either the gallium or galliumpalladium-
containing catalysts.
Figure 7 condenses this last finding and shows that the
2020-cm1 peak intensity is directly proportional to the to-
tal gallium content (lower scale). Moreover, since the Gaδ+
fraction is almost the same when using different total gal-
lium loading (see Table 2), these intensity values, as also
shown in Fig. 7, have a linear relationship with the Gaδ+
loading, too (upper scale).
Similar behavior was observed for the OH band at
3670 cm1, although the quantification had more random
