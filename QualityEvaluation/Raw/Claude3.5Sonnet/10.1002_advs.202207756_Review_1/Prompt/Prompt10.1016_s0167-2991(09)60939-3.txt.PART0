Transformation of Propene into Aromatic Hydrocarbons over
ZSM-5 Zeolites
M. Shibata, H. Ki tagawa, Y. Sendoda, and 
Department of Chemical Engineering, Tokyo Institute of Technology, Meguro-ku,
Tokyo 152,
Japan
The
conversion
of
propene
into aromatic hydrocarbons over
H-,
Ga- and
Zn-ZSM-5 and the
corresponding borosilicates
has
been
studied.
The yield of aromatic hydrocarbons is greatly en-
hanced by introducing Ga or Zn cations into ZSM-5 Or the boro-
silicate.
Over
ZSM-5,
the interconversion of olefins proceeds
much faster than the aromatization, giving a variety of aro-
matic hydrocarbons.
Over borosilicates,
the rate of the olefin
interconversion proceeds
much more slowly,
and
the
main aro-
matic
products
from
propene and I-butene are
benzene and
xylenes, respectively, at least at low conversion levels and at
higher reaction temperatures.
Zn-borosilicate has
no activity
for propane conversion,
while it shows a good activity for
propene aromatization, indicating that zinc cations have no
direct interaction with alkanes, but they activate olefinic
species.
It is concluded that zinc or gallium cations act as a
dehydrogenation catalyst to give allylic species
from olefins
in the conversion of both alkanes and alkenes.
INTRODUCTION
The transformation of alkanes into more useful chemicals like aromatics is of
great importance in the respect of
the effective utilization of hydrocarbon re-
sources.
Csicsery
[1]
reported
on
the
dehydrocyclodimerization of
lower alkanes
over bifunctional catalysts.
A 22.4% yield of aromatic hydrocarbons
was obtained
over Pt/A1 20 3 at 833 K.
ZSM-5 zeolites are known to transform lower alkanes into
aromatics
[2-6].
It is also
known that gallium or zinc species incorporated in
ZSM-5 zeolites enhances the capability of the zeolites for the aromatization
[7,8].
Mole et al. [9] studied the reaction of propane over Zn-ZSM-5 and con-
cluded that zinc cations act as an acceptor of hydride from propane molecules.
The present authors [10,11] have studied the conversion of propane and pentane
over gallium containing zeolites and concluded that the gallium species have
nothing to do with the activation of alkane molecules,
but take part in the
pathway from alkenes to aromatics.
Here,
alkenes are supposed to be the primary
products from alkanes.
Therefore,
in order to clear the role of gallium or zinc
species,
it is essential to examine the interaction of alkenes with incorporated
metal
species.
This
work concerns with the conversion of propene over
H-ZSM-5,
Ga-ZSM-5 and Zn-ZSM-5.
For comparison,
the conversion over borosilicates is also
studied.
EXPERIMENTAL
1.
Catalyst Preparation
ZSM 5 zeolites of varing aluminium contents were prepared according to the
method described in a patent [12].
The synthesized materials were first converted
into ammonium
form
(NH4-ZSM-5)
by
using the procedures described by Jacobs
[13].
The gallium-exchanged forms of ZSM-5
(Ga-ZSM-5) were made by refluxing an aqueous
solution of Ga(N03)39H20 containing
NH4-ZSM-5 for
24
h.
The zinc-exchanged forms
of ZSM-5 (Zn-ZSM-5)
were made by exchanging three times with a zinc nitrate
717
718
(CA-3-2)
solution at 353 K for
24
h.
Borosilicates with ZSM-5 structure were prepared
according to the method described in a patent
[14].
The
borosilicates also were
exchanged to their gallium and zinc
forms.
The catalysts
were pressed.
crushed
and sorted into grains of 16-32 mesh.
2.
Apparatus
The reactions were carried out with a continuous flow reactor operating at
atmospheric pressure.
The
catalyst
was
packed in
a reactor of silica-tubing
(10
mm i.d.) placed in a vertical furnace,
and then heated under an air stream at 883
K for 90 min.
By this treatment.
NH4-ZSM-5 was expected to be converted into the
proton form of the zeolite
(H-ZSM-5).
Gaseous reactants were fed directly to the
preheating zone of the reactor through a flowmeter.
The effluent gas from the
reactor tube
was withdrawn periodically and analyzed by gas chromatography.
Two
GC columns.
a
30
m long OV-lOl column and a
2 m long Porapack Q column were
employed.
The conversion and the product distribution were expressed on the
carbon number basis. if not described otherwise.

In a previous work on the propane conversion over Ga-ZSM-S,
we have
proposed that olefins are intermediates for the aromatization and that Ga species
participate in
the olefin activation rather
than
the activation of the starting
paraffin,
and that the higher conversion over Ga-ZSM-S is the results of the
effective conversion of intermediates,
which results in the smaller reproduction
of propane by
the cracking of the olefin oligomerization products
[101.
Table
1
shows that the selectivity to lower ole fins is low over Zn- and Ga-ZSM-S in
comparison with H-ZSM-S, in conformity with the idea that these intermediate
products are readily lost by the rapid aromatization over the former two zeolites.
To find the role of acid sites,
the reaction of propane over borosilicates was
also carried out.
As shown in Table 2, H-
and Zn-borosilicate have almost no
activity for propane activation.
It has been reported that the acidities of
borosilicates are very weak [lS-17].
The low activity of H-borosilicate indicates
the acidic sites are indispensable for the activation of propane as suggested in a
previous
work
[10,11].
Ga-borosilicate has some activity for propane conversion.
This may indicate that acidic sites are induced into the borosilicate upon the
ion-exchange with gallium cations.
It is plausible that the part of boron in the
framework is replaced by gallium in the acidic solution (pH 2-3) where the ion
exchange was made.
2.
Conversion of Propene
2 1 Temperature Dependence
The effect of the reaction temperature on the product distribution in the
conversion of propene over H-ZSM-S and Ga-ZSM-S was examined.
The results are
given in Fig. 1.
Over H-ZSM-5, the conversion of propene was over 9S% below 673
K,
while it decreased to about 80% over 773 K.
The yield of aromatics was almost
constant at
30% over 573 K.
The yields of other products depended greatly on the
reaction temperature.
Thus,
at
523
K,
the
main products were hydrocarbons
with
five or more carbon atoms, indicating that the oligomerization of propene is a
predominant reaction.
As the temperature increased, the yield of heavier products
decreased and the smaller products like ethene increased,
indicating the occur-
rence of the cracking of the oligomerization products.
Below
673 K,
the product
distribution over Ga-ZSM-5 was similar to that over H-ZSM-S.
In this temperature
range,
appreciable amounts of propane and isobutane
were produced together
with
aromatic hydrocarbons.
This indicates that aromatic hydrocarbons are mainly
produced by the successive hydride and proton transfer of the olefin oligomeriza-
tion products as preViously suggested by Poustma [18] and Mole and coworkers [9].
According to this mechanism, the formation of one aromatic molecule must result in
the formation of three paraffin molecules.
At higher temperature, much higher
yield of aromatics was attained over Ga-ZSM-5 and the formation of aromatics did
not go together with the formation of paraffins.
Therefore, it is concluded that
the mechanism of the formation of aromatics over Ga-ZSM-5 must be entirely dif-
ferent
from that over H-ZSM-5 particularly at higher temperatures,
and act as the
direct dehydrogenation of olefins or their oligomers proceeds on Ga cations.
The
yield of lower ole fins were much lower over Ga-ZSM-5 than H-ZSM-5.
This also
suggests that Ga cations are effective in converting olefins into aromatic hydro-
carbons.
Fig. 2 shows the dependence of the distribution of aromatic products on the
reaction temperature over Ga-ZSM-5.
At 573 K, aromatics with 8 or more carbon
atoms were main products.
As the reaction temperature increased, the the fraction
of these compounds decreased,
and benzene and toluene increased instead,
indica-
ting that the dealkylation of alkyl aromatics proceeds at higher temperatures.
At
8S3 K,
naphthalene was also observed.
2-2 Effect of contact time
The effect of the contact time(W/F) on the product distribution in propene
conversion over H-ZSM-S and Ga-ZSM-5 was examined at 773 K.
The results are given
in Fig. 3(a) and (b), respectively.
Over H-ZSM-5, the total conversion and the
yield of aromatics increased with contact time and reached
80% and
40%,
respec-
tively, at W/F = 10 g h mol- 1

reaction, appreciable amount of butenes and hydrocarbons with more than four
carbon atoms are formed and these molecules are intermediates for the aromatiza-
tion,
for the yield of these compounds decreased at the later stage.
Over Ga-ZSM-S,
both the total conversion and the selectivity were
much higher
than those obtained with H-ZSM-S.
Thus,
the total conversion was almost 100% and
the selectivity to aromatics reached
7S% at longer contact
time.
The decline of
the intermediates like butene and ethene
was
much faster over Ga-ZSM-S than over
H-ZSM-S,
indicating that Ga species was effective in converting lower olefins into
aromatics.
It is worthwhile to note that ethene and butenes are formed appreciably at the
early stage,
where the yield of aromatics was still very low,
indicating that the
interconversion between olefins is very fast and precedes the aromatization.
This
explains why variuos aromatic products were formed from
a single starting olefin.
Actually,
similar distributions of aromatic products were obtained irrespective of
the starting olefin;
ethene,
propene,
or I-butene (Fig.
4).
The rapid intercon-
version among olefins over H-ZSM-S was reported earlier by Garwood et al. [19].
}. Conversion of Propene over Borosilicates
As described above, the aromatization seems to proceed with a bifunctional
action of the catalysts:
Bronsted acid sites are responsible for oligomerization
and cracking,
while cationic species plausibly serve as
a dehydrogenation cata-
lyst.
In order to bring out the role of cationic species in the aromatization by
suppressing the activity of acidic sites, the conversion of propene over boro-
silicates was carried out.
The acidity of borosilicates is known to be very weak
[lS-17].
The reaction over Zn-ZSM-S
was also carried out for comparison purpose.
The results are given in Table
3.
Over H-borosilicate the yield of aromatics
was very small even at 873 K.
The
yield of paraffins like propane
was also very small in a striking constant with
the conversion over aluminosilicates,
H-ZSM-S and Zn-ZSM-S.
This indicates that
the hydride transfer between carbenium ion and olefin molecules does not occur
appreciably in borosilicates.
Over Zn-borosilicate the aromatic hydrocarbons were
produced in yields of 2S and 4S% and 773 K and 873 K, respectively.

incorporation of zinc cations to the borosilicates induced the aromatization
activity.
The formation of paraffins are still small,
indicating that the mecha-
nism of the formation of aromatic hydrocarbons does not involve hydride transfer
between carbenium ion and olefin molecules.
Over Zn-borosilicate the selectivity to benzene as high as
50% among aromatic
products
was obtained at 873 K.
This shows that the aromatization proceeds in
a
comparable rate with the interconversion among olefins over these less acidic
catalyst.
This trend was more clearly seen under the conditions of shorter con-
tact time and lower propene pressure.
Under these conditions, the deactivation of
the catalyst
occurred as shown in Fig. 5(a); both the total conversion and the
yield of aromatics decreased with time.
Molar fractions of benzene,
toluene and
C8aromatics
among aromatic products were plotted as a function of the total
conversion
[Fig.
5(b)].
The fraction of benzene decreased with the propene con-
version,
while those of the other aromatics increased with the conversion.
If
we
extrapolate the benzene fraction to zero conversion, it approaches to 100%.
This
shows that benzene would be the only aromatic product from propene if the inter-
conversion among olefins
over acidic sites was completely eliminated.
The first
step of the propene activation is plausibly the formation of allylic
species
by
the action of zinc cations.
The dimerization of allylic species and the subsequent abstraction of hydrogen
atoms should give benzene molecules.
The formation of allylic species on zinc
oxide has been reported.
Kokes and coworkers [20] made detailed studies on ad-
sorption of propene on zinc oxide with infrared spectroscopy and found the forma-
tion of allylic species.
Seiyama and coworkers
[21]
found the formation of ben-
zene as a main product in the oxidation of propene over zinc oxide.
The direct
abstraction of hydride from propane, as suggested by Mole et a L, [9] seems to be
very improbable,
since Zn-borosilicate had a very small activity for
the conver-
sion of propane.
On the other hand, it had a reasonably good activity for the
aromatization of propene.
The fact that zinc cations are effective for the dehydrogenation of olefins was
further supported by the reaction of I-butene over Zn-borosilicate.
Under the low
conversion conditions at 873 K,
a butadiene yield of as high as 60% was obtained.
Here again,
the first aromatic products observed were mainly xylenes,
indicating
that the aromatics are formed from two C4-moieties.
Stylene was also seen in the
products.
Similar product distribution was observed also in the conversion of 1-
butene over Ga-borosilicate.
