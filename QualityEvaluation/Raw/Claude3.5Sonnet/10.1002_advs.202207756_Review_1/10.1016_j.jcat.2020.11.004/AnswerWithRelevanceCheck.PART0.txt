          [1] "Ga speciation under reaction conditions remains controversial."

[2] "Various experimental techniques including in-situ Ga K edge X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES), ex-situ FTIR and NH3-temperature-programmed desorption (NH3-TPD) have been employed to probe Ga speciation in Ga/H-ZSM-5 and identify the active site in the PDH reaction"

[3] "Early in-situ X-ray absorption study showed that isolated Ga+ ions are the main species in Ga/H-ZSM-5 independent of the gallium loading and the utilized reducing gas"

[4] "Alternative interpretations of edge shifts in Ga K-edge XANES spectra acquired under reaction conditions have been proposed, as XANES spectra are not sufficiently resolved to differentiate Ga+ from low-coordinate Ga-alkyl or hydride species"

[5] "In this work, in-situ transmission Fourier Transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy is employed to systematically investigate Ga speciation in Ga/H-ZSM-5 with three Si/Al ratios (15, 28 and 39) and a wide range of Ga/Al ratios (01.7)."

[6] "These results provide direct experimental evidence for the existence of two types of Ga species on reduced Ga/H-ZSM-5, highlighting the possibility that they have different catalytic activities in alkane dehydrogenation reactions."

          The primary challenges in elucidating Ga speciation in Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts under propane dehydrogenation (PDH) conditions include:

1. The controversial nature of Ga speciation under reaction conditions.
2. Limitations of individual characterization techniques. For example, XANES spectra lack sufficient resolution to differentiate between certain Ga species.
3. The dynamic nature of Ga species under reaction conditions, making ex-situ characterization potentially unreliable.
4. The complexity of Ga speciation, which can vary with Si/Al ratios and Ga/Al ratios in the zeolite.

In-situ and operando characterization techniques contribute to overcoming these challenges and advancing our understanding of structure-activity relationships in these catalytic systems by:

1. Allowing direct observation of Ga species under reaction-like conditions, avoiding artifacts from ex-situ measurements.
2. Providing real-time information on the evolution of Ga species during catalyst activation and reaction.
3. Enabling systematic investigations across a range of catalyst compositions and conditions.
4. Combining multiple techniques (e.g., FTIR, XANES) to provide complementary information and overcome limitations of individual methods.
5. Revealing the dynamic behavior of Ga species during catalyst activation and reaction.
6. Allowing for the identification of distinct Ga species and their reactivity.

These advanced characterization approaches significantly enhance our understanding of the complex Ga speciation in Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts, providing valuable insights into the nature of active sites and reaction mechanisms in PDH reactions. For example, the use of in-situ transmission FTIR spectroscopy in this study enabled a systematic investigation of Ga speciation across different Si/Al and Ga/Al ratios, providing direct experimental evidence for the existence of two types of Ga species with potentially different catalytic activities in alkane dehydrogenation reactions.

          在丙烷脱氢(PDH)条件下阐明Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂中Ga物种的主要挑战包括：

1. 反应条件下Ga物种的性质仍存在争议。
2. 单一表征技术的局限性。例如，XANES光谱分辨率不足以区分某些Ga物种。
3. 反应条件下Ga物种的动态特性，使得非原位表征可能不可靠。
4. Ga物种的复杂性，可随沸石中的Si/Al比和Ga/Al比而变化。

原位和操作表征技术通过以下方式有助于克服这些挑战并推进我们对这些催化系统中结构-活性关系的理解：

1. 允许在类似反应条件下直接观察Ga物种，避免非原位测量的人为因素。
2. 提供催化剂活化和反应过程中Ga物种演变的实时信息。
3. 能够在一系列催化剂组成和条件下进行系统研究。
4. 结合多种技术（如FTIR、XANES）提供互补信息，克服单一方法的局限性。
5. 揭示催化剂活化和反应过程中Ga物种的动态行为。
6. 允许识别不同的Ga物种及其反应性。

这些先进的表征方法显著增进了我们对Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂中复杂Ga物种的理解，为PDH反应中活性位点的性质和反应机理提供了宝贵的见解。例如，本研究中使用的原位透射FTIR光谱技术能够在不同Si/Al和Ga/Al比例下系统研究Ga物种，为两种类型的Ga物种的存在提供了直接的实验证据，这些Ga物种在烷烃脱氢反应中可能具有不同的催化活性。
