[1] "Ga speciation under reaction conditions remains controversial."

[2] "Various experimental techniques including in-situ Ga K edge X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES), ex-situ FTIR and NH3-temperature-programmed desorption (NH3-TPD) have been employed to probe Ga speciation in Ga/H-ZSM-5 and identify the active site in the PDH reaction"

[3] "Early in-situ X-ray absorption study showed that isolated Ga+ ions are the main species in Ga/H-ZSM-5 independent of the gallium loading and the utilized reducing gas"

[4] "Alternative interpretations of edge shifts in Ga K-edge XANES spectra acquired under reaction conditions have been proposed, as XANES spectra are not sufficiently resolved to differentiate Ga+ from low-coordinate Ga-alkyl or hydride species"

[5] "In this work, in-situ transmission Fourier Transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy is employed to systematically investigate Ga speciation in Ga/H-ZSM-5 with three Si/Al ratios (15, 28 and 39) and a wide range of Ga/Al ratios (01.7)."

The primary challenges in elucidating Ga speciation in Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts under PDH conditions include:

1. Controversial nature of Ga speciation under reaction conditions
2. Limitations of individual characterization techniques
3. Difficulty in differentiating between various Ga species

In situ and operando characterization techniques contribute to overcoming these challenges and advancing our understanding of structure-activity relationships by:

1. Providing real-time information on catalyst structure under reaction conditions
2. Allowing systematic investigation of Ga speciation across different Si/Al and Ga/Al ratios
3. Enabling the detection and differentiation of various Ga species
4. Offering complementary information when multiple techniques are combined

In-situ transmission FTIR spectroscopy, as employed in this study, allows for a comprehensive investigation of Ga speciation under conditions close to those used in PDH reactions. This technique helps overcome limitations of other methods like XANES, which cannot sufficiently differentiate between certain Ga species. By systematically studying Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts with varying compositions, researchers can gain deeper insights into the relationship between catalyst structure and catalytic performance in PDH reactions.

在PDH条件下阐明Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂中Ga物种的主要挑战包括：

1. 反应条件下Ga物种的争议性质
2. 单一表征技术的局限性
3. 区分各种Ga物种的困难

原位和操作表征技术通过以下方式有助于克服这些挑战并推进我们对结构-活性关系的理解：

1. 提供反应条件下催化剂结构的实时信息
2. 允许系统研究不同Si/Al和Ga/Al比例下的Ga物种
3. 能够检测和区分各种Ga物种
4. 当多种技术结合使用时提供互补信息

本研究中采用的原位透射FTIR光谱技术允许在接近PDH反应所用条件下对Ga物种进行全面调查。这种技术有助于克服其他方法（如XANES）的局限性，后者无法充分区分某些Ga物种。通过系统研究不同组成的Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂，研究人员可以深入了解PDH反应中催化剂结构与催化性能之间的关系。
