[1] "However, Ga speciation under reaction conditions remains controversial."

[2] "Various experimental techniques including in-situ Ga K edge X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES), ex-situ FTIR and NH3-temperature-programmed desorption (NH3-TPD) have been employed to probe Ga speciation in Ga/H-ZSM-5 and identify the active site in the PDH reaction"

[3] "Early in-situ X-ray absorption study showed that isolated Ga+ ions are the main species in Ga/H-ZSM-5 independent of the gallium loading and the utilized reducing gas"

[4] "Alternative interpretations of edge shifts in Ga K-edge XANES spectra acquired under reaction conditions have been proposed, as XANES spectra are not sufficiently resolved to differentiate Ga+ from low-coordinate Ga-alkyl or hydride species"

[5] "In this work, in-situ transmission Fourier Transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy is employed to systematically investigate Ga speciation in Ga/H-ZSM-5 with three Si/Al ratios (15, 28 and 39) and a wide range of Ga/Al ratios (01.7)."

The primary challenges in elucidating Ga speciation in Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts under PDH conditions include:

1. The controversial nature of Ga speciation under reaction conditions.

2. Limitations of existing characterization techniques. For example, XANES spectra lack sufficient resolution to differentiate between Ga+ and low-coordinate Ga-alkyl or hydride species.

3. The dynamic nature of the catalyst under reaction conditions, making it difficult to capture the true active state.

In-situ and operando characterization techniques contribute to overcoming these challenges by:

1. Allowing direct observation of the catalyst under reaction-like conditions, providing more relevant information about the active state.

2. Enabling the study of Ga speciation across a wide range of catalyst compositions (Si/Al ratios and Ga/Al ratios).

3. Providing complementary information to other techniques, allowing for a more comprehensive understanding of the catalyst structure and behavior.

4. Revealing the dynamic changes in Ga speciation during catalyst activation and reaction.

By employing these advanced characterization techniques, researchers can gain deeper insights into the structure-activity relationships in Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts, potentially leading to the development of more efficient and selective catalysts for propane dehydrogenation.

在PDH条件下阐明Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂中Ga物种的主要挑战包括：

1. 反应条件下Ga物种的性质存在争议。

2. 现有表征技术的局限性。例如，XANES光谱分辨率不足，无法区分Ga+和低配位Ga-烷基或氢化物物种。

3. 催化剂在反应条件下的动态性质，使得捕捉真实活性状态变得困难。

原位和操作条件下表征技术通过以下方式有助于克服这些挑战：

1. 允许在类似反应条件下直接观察催化剂，提供更相关的活性状态信息。

2. 能够研究广泛催化剂组成范围（Si/Al比和Ga/Al比）下的Ga物种。

3. 为其他技术提供补充信息，从而更全面地了解催化剂结构和行为。

4. 揭示催化剂活化和反应过程中Ga物种的动态变化。

通过采用这些先进的表征技术，研究人员可以深入了解Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂的结构-活性关系，有可能开发出更高效、更具选择性的丙烷脱氢催化剂。
