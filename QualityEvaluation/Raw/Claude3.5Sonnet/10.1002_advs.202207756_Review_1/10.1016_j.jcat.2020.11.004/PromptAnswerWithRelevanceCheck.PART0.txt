[1] "Ga speciation under reaction conditions remains controversial."

[2] "Various experimental techniques including in-situ Ga K edge X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES), ex-situ FTIR and NH3-temperature-programmed desorption (NH3-TPD) have been employed to probe Ga speciation in Ga/H-ZSM-5 and identify the active site in the PDH reaction"

[3] "Early in-situ X-ray absorption study showed that isolated Ga+ ions are the main species in Ga/H-ZSM-5 independent of the gallium loading and the utilized reducing gas"

[4] "Alternative interpretations of edge shifts in Ga K-edge XANES spectra acquired under reaction conditions have been proposed, as XANES spectra are not sufficiently resolved to differentiate Ga+ from low-coordinate Ga-alkyl or hydride species"

[5] "In this work, in-situ transmission Fourier Transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy is employed to systematically investigate Ga speciation in Ga/H-ZSM-5 with three Si/Al ratios (15, 28 and 39) and a wide range of Ga/Al ratios (01.7)."

The primary challenges in elucidating Ga speciation in Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts under PDH conditions include:

1. Controversial nature of Ga speciation under reaction conditions
2. Limitations of individual characterization techniques
3. Difficulty in differentiating between various Ga species

In situ and operando characterization techniques contribute to overcoming these challenges and advancing our understanding of structure-activity relationships by:

1. Providing real-time information on catalyst structure under reaction conditions
2. Allowing systematic investigation of Ga speciation across different Si/Al and Ga/Al ratios
3. Enabling the detection and differentiation of various Ga species
4. Offering complementary information when multiple techniques are combined

In-situ transmission FTIR spectroscopy, as employed in this study, allows for a comprehensive investigation of Ga speciation under conditions close to those used in PDH reactions. This technique helps overcome limitations of other methods like XANES, which cannot sufficiently differentiate between certain Ga species. By systematically studying Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts with varying compositions, researchers can gain deeper insights into the relationship between catalyst structure and catalytic performance in PDH reactions.
