[1] "The state of gallium in these catalysts has not been elucidated yet."

[2] "In the present study we investigated the state of gallium in reduced Ga/HZSM-5 zeolite by highly sensitive DRIFT spectroscopy using adsorbed CO as a molecular probe."

[3] "Reduction of GaZSM-5 in hydrogen at 773 K and subsequent prolonged evacuation at 873 K did not show any infrared bands in the spectral range of 19002100 cm1 associated with gallium hydrides"

[4] "To obtain further insight into the stability of the hydrides, a hydrogen desorption experiment was carried out for a Ga/HZSM-5 sample that was previously reduced in hydrogen at elevated temperature and then cooled to room temperature in hydrogen."

[5] "The most extensive in situ study of the state of gallium in the working GaZSM-5 catalyst for propane aromatization has been carried out in Refs. [24,7]. The authors interpreted X-ray absorption data in the following way."

The primary challenges in elucidating Ga speciation in Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts under propane dehydrogenation (PDH) conditions include:

1. The complex and dynamic nature of Ga species under reaction conditions.

2. The difficulty in directly observing Ga species during catalysis.

3. The sensitivity of Ga species to temperature and gas atmosphere.

In situ and operando characterization techniques contribute to overcoming these challenges and advancing understanding of structure-activity relationships by:

1. Allowing observation of Ga species under realistic reaction conditions.

2. Providing real-time information on changes in Ga speciation during catalysis.

3. Enabling correlation between catalyst structure and catalytic performance.

4. Offering complementary information through different techniques.

The study used DRIFT spectroscopy with CO as a probe molecule to investigate reduced Ga species. This allowed identification of different Ga species and their transformations upon reduction, oxidation, and hydrogen adsorption. X-ray absorption spectroscopy was also mentioned as providing valuable information on Ga coordination and oxidation state changes during reaction.

These techniques help elucidate the nature of active Ga sites, their formation, and their role in catalysis, which is crucial for understanding structure-activity relationships and designing improved catalysts for propane dehydrogenation.

在丙烷脱氢（PDH）条件下阐明Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂中Ga物种的主要挑战包括：

1. 反应条件下Ga物种的复杂和动态性质。

2. 在催化过程中直接观察Ga物种的困难。

3. Ga物种对温度和气体氛围的敏感性。

原位和operando表征技术通过以下方式有助于克服这些挑战并推进对结构-活性关系的理解：

1. 允许在真实反应条件下观察Ga物种。

2. 提供催化过程中Ga物种变化的实时信息。

3. 能够将催化剂结构与催化性能相关联。

4. 通过不同技术提供互补信息。

该研究使用DRIFT光谱和CO作为探针分子来研究还原态的Ga物种。这允许识别不同的Ga物种及其在还原、氧化和氢吸附过程中的转变。文中还提到X射线吸收光谱在提供Ga配位和氧化态变化方面的valuable信息。

这些技术有助于阐明活性Ga位点的性质、其形成过程以及在催化中的作用，这对于理解结构-活性关系和设计改进的丙烷脱氢催化剂至关重要。
