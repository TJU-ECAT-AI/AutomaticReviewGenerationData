[1] "Various studies [9,10] show that only a small part of the protons is substituted by gallium ions upon calcination of catalysts prepared by ion exchange or incipient wetness impregnation. Instead, gallium is mostly present as small oxide particles at the external surface of the zeolite micrograins."

[2] "To increase the extent of proton substitution by gallium, such zeolites can be reduced in a hydrogen or hydrocarbon atmosphere at elevated temperatures, i.e., around 773 K [28]. These treatments facilitate the migration of the reduced gallium species into the micropores of the zeolite particles resulting in more complete substitution of the acid protons."

[3] "The most extensive in situ study of the state of gallium in the working GaZSM-5 catalyst for propane aromatization has been carried out in Refs. [24,7]. The authors interpreted X-ray absorption data in the following way. Reduction of octahedrally coordination Ga3+ ions leads to the formation of reduced univalent Ga+ ions or Ga metal."

[4] "In the present study we investigated the state of gallium in reduced Ga/HZSM-5 zeolite by highly sensitive DRIFT spectroscopy using adsorbed CO as a molecular probe."

The primary challenges in elucidating Ga speciation in Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts under propane dehydrogenation (PDH) conditions include:

1. Determining the location and distribution of Ga species, as they can exist both on the external surface and within zeolite micropores.

2. Understanding the dynamic nature of Ga species, which can change during reduction treatments and catalytic reactions.

3. Identifying the oxidation states and coordination environments of Ga species under reaction conditions.

In situ and operando characterization techniques contribute to overcoming these challenges by:

1. Providing real-time information on the state of Ga species during reduction treatments and catalytic reactions.

2. Allowing for the observation of changes in Ga speciation under different gas atmospheres and temperatures.

3. Enabling the identification of different Ga species through spectroscopic techniques such as DRIFT spectroscopy with CO as a probe molecule.

4. Offering insights into the migration of Ga species from the external surface into zeolite micropores during reduction treatments.

These techniques advance our understanding of structure-activity relationships by:

1. Correlating the observed Ga species with catalytic performance.

2. Revealing the role of different Ga species (e.g., Ga+, Ga3+, GaO+, GaH2+) in the catalytic process.

3. Elucidating the impact of reduction treatments on Ga distribution and its effect on catalyst activity.

4. Providing a more comprehensive picture of the dynamic nature of Ga species under reaction conditions, which is crucial for optimizing catalyst performance and stability.

在丙烷脱氢(PDH)条件下阐明Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂中Ga物种的主要挑战包括：

1. 确定Ga物种的位置和分布，因为它们可能同时存在于外表面和沸石微孔中。

2. 理解Ga物种的动态特性，它们可能在还原处理和催化反应过程中发生变化。

3. 在反应条件下识别Ga物种的氧化态和配位环境。

原位和操作条件下表征技术通过以下方式有助于克服这些挑战：

1. 提供还原处理和催化反应过程中Ga物种状态的实时信息。

2. 允许观察不同气氛和温度下Ga物种的变化。

3. 通过光谱技术（如使用CO作为探针分子的DRIFT光谱）能够识别不同的Ga物种。

4. 提供还原处理过程中Ga物种从外表面迁移到沸石微孔的洞察。

这些技术通过以下方式推进了我们对结构-活性关系的理解：

1. 将观察到的Ga物种与催化性能相关联。

2. 揭示不同Ga物种（如Ga+、Ga3+、GaO+、GaH2+）在催化过程中的作用。

3. 阐明还原处理对Ga分布的影响及其对催化剂活性的影响。

4. 提供反应条件下Ga物种动态特性的更全面图像，这对于优化催化剂性能和稳定性至关重要。
