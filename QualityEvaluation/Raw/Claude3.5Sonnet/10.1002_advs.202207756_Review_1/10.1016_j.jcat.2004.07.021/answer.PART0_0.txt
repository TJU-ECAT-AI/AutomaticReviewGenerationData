[1] "The state of gallium in these catalysts has not been elucidated yet."

[2] "In the present study we investigated the state of gallium in reduced Ga/HZSM-5 zeolite by highly sensitive DRIFT spectroscopy using adsorbed CO as a molecular probe."

[3] "The high mobility of gallium upon reduction is believed to be connected to the formation of unstable gaseous Ga2O oxide [5,6]. Subsequently, this oxide can react with acid protons in the zeolite micropores"

[4] "It has been put forward that univalent Ga+ cations are highly unstable [2,7]. Cooling a reduced sample in a hydrogen atmosphere to room temperature would result in the oxidation of Ga+ by traces of residual water or framework oxygen atoms with formation of (Ga(OH)2)+, (GaO)+ or even Ga2O3 species."

[5] "The most extensive in situ study of the state of gallium in the working GaZSM-5 catalyst for propane aromatization has been carried out in Refs. [24,7]. The authors interpreted X-ray absorption data in the following way."

The primary challenges in elucidating Ga speciation in Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts under propane dehydrogenation (PDH) conditions include:

1. The high mobility and instability of gallium species during reduction and reaction conditions.

2. The complexity of different gallium species that can form, including Ga+, Ga2O, (Ga(OH)2)+, (GaO)+, and Ga2O3.

3. The difficulty in directly observing and distinguishing between these various gallium species under reaction conditions.

In situ and operando characterization techniques contribute to overcoming these challenges by:

1. Allowing observation of catalyst changes in real-time under reaction conditions.

2. Providing spectroscopic evidence for different gallium species and their transformations.

3. Enabling the study of structure-activity relationships by correlating spectroscopic data with catalytic performance.

Specifically, this study used in situ DRIFT spectroscopy with CO as a probe molecule to investigate reduced Ga species. Other studies have employed in situ X-ray absorption spectroscopy to examine the oxidation state and coordination of Ga during propane aromatization. These techniques help elucidate the dynamic nature of Ga species under reaction conditions, contributing to a better understanding of the catalytically active sites and reaction mechanisms in Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts for PDH reactions.

在丙烷脱氢（PDH）条件下阐明Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂中Ga物种的主要挑战包括：

1. 还原和反应条件下镓物种的高迁移性和不稳定性。

2. 可能形成的不同镓物种的复杂性，包括Ga+、Ga2O、(Ga(OH)2)+、(GaO)+和Ga2O3。

3. 在反应条件下直接观察和区分这些不同镓物种的难度。

原位和操作条件下表征技术通过以下方式有助于克服这些挑战：

1. 允许在反应条件下实时观察催化剂的变化。

2. 为不同的镓物种及其转化提供光谱证据。

3. 通过将光谱数据与催化性能相关联，实现对结构-活性关系的研究。

具体而言，本研究使用原位DRIFT光谱技术，以CO作为探针分子来研究还原态的Ga物种。其他研究则采用原位X射线吸收光谱来检查丙烷芳构化过程中Ga的氧化态和配位状态。这些技术有助于阐明反应条件下Ga物种的动态性质，从而更好地理解Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂在PDH反应中的催化活性位点和反应机理。
