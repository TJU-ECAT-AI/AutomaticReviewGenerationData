          [1] "Elucidating the Ga speciation on Ga/H-ZSM-5 at PDH conditions is a prerequisite for understanding the structureactivity relations. This is, however, far from trivial. PDH produces hydrogen, so the catalyst operates in a reducing environment (typically above 500 C)."

[2] "Thus, only characterizations conducted in situ/operando or at least on reduced Ga/H-ZSM-5 could provide relevant information regarding the speciation of Ga on the catalyst during PDH."

[3] "PDH on Ga/H-ZSM-5 occurs at high temperatures (typically >500C), and thus reaction intermediates are short-lived and difficult to detect experimentally."

[4] "X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) could be conducted in situ or operando, and thus is well suited for determining the Ga speciation in Ga/H-ZSM-5 at PDH conditions."

[5] "The chemical specificity of FTIR spectroscopy makes it well-suited for identifying reaction intermediates."

[6] "Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts are commonly prepared by impregnating a Ga salt, for example, Ga(NO3)3, on the H-ZSM-5 support, followed by calcination in the air. At this point, Ga in the as-synthesized Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalyst is typically at its highest oxidation state, that is, +3. Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts are then reduced in an H2 atmosphere at the reaction temperature before the feed is introduced."

          The primary challenges in elucidating Ga speciation in Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts under propane dehydrogenation (PDH) conditions include:

1. The reducing environment created by hydrogen production during PDH, typically above 500°C.
2. The high temperatures at which PDH occurs, making reaction intermediates short-lived and difficult to detect experimentally.
3. The dynamic nature of Ga species, which change from their initial oxidation state (+3) to reduced forms during the reaction process.

In situ and operando characterization techniques contribute to overcoming these challenges and advancing our understanding of structure-activity relationships in these catalytic systems by:

1. Allowing for the study of Ga speciation under actual PDH conditions or on reduced Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts.
2. Providing real-time information about the catalyst structure and behavior during the reaction.
3. Enabling the detection of short-lived intermediates and structural changes that may not be present in ex situ studies.

Specifically, X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) and Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy are well-suited for these studies. XAS can be conducted in situ or operando, making it ideal for determining Ga speciation under PDH conditions. FTIR spectroscopy's chemical specificity allows for the identification of reaction intermediates. These techniques provide crucial insights into the dynamic nature of the catalyst and help establish structure-activity relationships in Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalytic systems for PDH reactions.

          在丙烷脱氢（PDH）条件下阐明Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂中Ga物种的主要挑战包括：

1. PDH过程中产生的氢气创造了还原环境，通常温度高于500°C。
2. PDH发生的高温条件使反应中间体寿命短暂，难以通过实验检测。
3. Ga物种的动态特性，在反应过程中从初始氧化态（+3）变为还原形式。

原位和操作条件下的表征技术通过以下方式有助于克服这些挑战，并推进我们对这些催化系统中结构-活性关系的理解：

1. 允许在实际PDH条件下或在还原的Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂上研究Ga物种。
2. 提供关于催化剂在反应过程中结构和行为的实时信息。
3. 能够检测短寿命中间体和可能在非原位研究中不存在的结构变化。

具体而言，X射线吸收光谱（XAS）和傅里叶变换红外（FTIR）光谱技术特别适合这些研究。XAS可以在原位或操作条件下进行，使其成为确定PDH条件下Ga物种形态的理想工具。FTIR光谱的化学特异性允许识别反应中间体。这些技术为催化剂的动态特性提供了关键见解，并有助于建立Ga/H-ZSM-5催化系统在PDH反应中的结构-活性关系。
