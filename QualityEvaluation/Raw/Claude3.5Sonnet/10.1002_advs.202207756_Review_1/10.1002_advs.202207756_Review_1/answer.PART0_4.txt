[1] "Elucidating the Ga speciation on Ga/H-ZSM-5 at PDH conditions is a prerequisite for understanding the structureactivity relations. This is, however, far from trivial. PDH produces hydrogen, so the catalyst operates in a reducing environment (typically above 500 C)."

[2] "Thus, only characterizations conducted in situ/operando or at least on reduced Ga/H-ZSM-5 could provide relevant information regarding the speciation of Ga on the catalyst during PDH."

[3] "X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) could be conducted in situ or operando, and thus is well suited for determining the Ga speciation in Ga/H-ZSM-5 at PDH conditions."

[4] "The chemical specificity of FTIR spectroscopy makes it well-suited for identifying reaction intermediates."

The primary challenges in elucidating Ga speciation in Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts under PDH conditions include:

1. The reducing environment created by hydrogen production during PDH, typically above 500°C.

2. The dynamic nature of Ga species, which change during the reaction process.

3. The short-lived nature of reaction intermediates at high temperatures.

In situ and operando characterization techniques contribute significantly to overcoming these challenges and advancing our understanding of structure-activity relationships by:

1. Allowing observation of Ga species under actual reaction conditions or on reduced catalysts.

2. Providing real-time information about changes in Ga speciation during the reaction.

3. Enabling the detection of short-lived intermediates.

Specifically, X-ray Absorption Spectroscopy (XAS) can be conducted in situ or operando, making it well-suited for determining Ga speciation under PDH conditions. FTIR spectroscopy, with its chemical specificity, is particularly useful for identifying reaction intermediates. These techniques provide crucial information about the structure and behavior of active sites during the reaction, which is essential for understanding structure-activity relationships in Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalytic systems.

在丙烷脱氢（PDH）条件下阐明Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂中Ga的物种形态的主要挑战包括：

1. PDH过程中产生的氢气创造了还原性环境，通常温度高于500°C。

2. Ga物种的动态性质，在反应过程中会发生变化。

3. 高温下反应中间体的短暂性。

原位和操作条件下表征技术通过以下方式显著地有助于克服这些挑战并推进我们对结构-活性关系的理解：

1. 允许在实际反应条件下或在还原态催化剂上观察Ga物种。

2. 提供关于反应过程中Ga物种变化的实时信息。

3. 能够检测短暂的中间体。

具体而言，X射线吸收光谱（XAS）可以在原位或操作条件下进行，使其非常适合确定PDH条件下的Ga物种形态。FTIR光谱由于其化学特异性，特别适用于识别反应中间体。这些技术提供了关于反应过程中活性位点结构和行为的关键信息，这对于理解Ga/H-ZSM-5催化系统中的结构-活性关系至关重要。
