[1] "Determining the role of gallium species in these reactions has proven difficult, as the nature of the active species remains unclear, mainly because the active gallium species is highly dispersed and only present under reaction (reductive) conditions."

[2] "In this sense, X-ray absorption techniques are extremely useful as they allow the detection of dispersed and even isolated species and were already used in the literature in order to study this system."

[3] "In situ gallium K edge XAFS spectroscopy experiments were performed with GaZSM5 catalysts containing two different gallium loadings (2 and 4%) under hydrogen or propane in the 703823K temperature range."

[4] "It was found that, irrespective of the gallium loading and reducing gas, linear correlations were found between the coordination numbers of both the first (GaO scattering legs) and second (GaGa scattering legs) gallium coordination spheres estimated from EXAFS and the degree of reduction estimated by XANES."

The primary challenges in elucidating Ga speciation in Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts under propane dehydrogenation (PDH) conditions include:

1. The active gallium species are highly dispersed and only present under reaction conditions, making them difficult to detect and characterize.

2. The nature of the active species remains unclear due to their transient nature during catalysis.

In situ and operando characterization techniques, particularly X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS), contribute to overcoming these challenges by:

1. Allowing detection of dispersed and isolated species under reaction conditions.

2. Providing information on the local structure and oxidation state of gallium species during catalysis.

3. Enabling the correlation between structural changes and the degree of reduction of gallium species.

4. Facilitating the study of structure-activity relationships by allowing simultaneous measurement of catalyst structure and catalytic performance.

These advanced characterization techniques have significantly advanced our understanding of the evolution of gallium species during propane dehydrogenation, revealing the formation of isolated Ga+ species as the likely active sites for the reaction.

在丙烷脱氢（PDH）条件下阐明Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂中Ga物种的主要挑战包括：

1. 活性镓物种高度分散，且仅在反应条件下存在，使其难以检测和表征。

2. 由于活性物种在催化过程中的瞬态性质，其本质仍不清楚。

原位和操作表征技术，特别是X射线吸收光谱（XAS），通过以下方式有助于克服这些挑战：

1. 允许在反应条件下检测分散和孤立的物种。

2. 提供催化过程中镓物种的局部结构和氧化态信息。

3. 能够关联镓物种的结构变化和还原程度。

4. 通过同时测量催化剂结构和催化性能，促进对结构-活性关系的研究。

这些先进的表征技术显著提高了我们对丙烷脱氢过程中镓物种演变的理解，揭示了孤立Ga+物种的形成可能是反应的活性位点。
