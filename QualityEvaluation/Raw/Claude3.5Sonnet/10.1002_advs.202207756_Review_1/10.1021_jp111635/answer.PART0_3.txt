[1] "Determining the role of gallium species in these reactions has proven difficult, as the nature of the active species remains unclear, mainly because the active gallium species is highly dispersed and only present under reaction (reductive) conditions."

[2] "X-ray absorption techniques are extremely useful as they allow the detection of dispersed and even isolated species and were already used in the literature in order to study this system."

[3] "In situ gallium K edge XAFS spectroscopy experiments were performed with GaZSM5 catalysts containing two different gallium loadings (2 and 4%) under hydrogen or propane in the 703823K temperature range."

[4] "It was found that, irrespective of the gallium loading and reducing gas, linear correlations were found between the coordination numbers of both the first (GaO scattering legs) and second (GaGa scattering legs) gallium coordination spheres estimated from EXAFS and the degree of reduction estimated by XANES."

[5] "The results showed that the reduction proceeds from Ga3+ binuclear species 4-fold coordinated to oxygen to an isolated Ga+ ion coordinated to a single oxygen atom."

The primary challenges in elucidating Ga speciation in Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts under propane dehydrogenation (PDH) conditions include:

1. The active gallium species are highly dispersed and only present under reaction conditions, making them difficult to detect and characterize.

2. The nature of the active species remains unclear due to their transient nature during the reaction.

In situ and operando characterization techniques, particularly X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS), contribute to overcoming these challenges and advancing our understanding of structure-activity relationships in these catalytic systems by:

1. Allowing detection of dispersed and isolated species under reaction conditions.

2. Providing information on the oxidation state and local structure of gallium species during the reaction.

3. Enabling the correlation between coordination numbers (from EXAFS) and degree of reduction (from XANES) for both first and second coordination spheres of gallium.

4. Revealing the reduction process from Ga3+ binuclear species to isolated Ga+ ions.

These techniques provide crucial insights into the dynamic nature of gallium species under reaction conditions, helping to establish structure-activity relationships and improve catalyst design for propane dehydrogenation reactions.

在丙烷脱氢(PDH)条件下阐明Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂中Ga物种的主要挑战包括：

1. 活性镓物种高度分散且仅在反应条件下存在，使其难以检测和表征。

2. 由于活性物种在反应过程中的瞬态性质，其本质仍不清楚。

原位和operando表征技术，特别是X射线吸收光谱(XAS)，通过以下方式有助于克服这些挑战并推进我们对这些催化系统中结构-活性关系的理解：

1. 允许在反应条件下检测分散和孤立的物种。

2. 提供反应过程中镓物种的氧化态和局部结构信息。

3. 能够关联镓的第一和第二配位球的配位数(来自EXAFS)和还原程度(来自XANES)。

4. 揭示了从Ga3+双核物种到孤立Ga+离子的还原过程。

这些技术为反应条件下镓物种的动态性质提供了关键见解，有助于建立结构-活性关系并改进丙烷脱氢反应的催化剂设计。
