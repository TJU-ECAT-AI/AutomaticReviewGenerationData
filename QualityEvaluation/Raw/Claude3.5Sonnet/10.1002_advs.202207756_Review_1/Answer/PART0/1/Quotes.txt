[1] "The structure of the active intrazeolite Ga species and their reactivity in oxidative and reductive conditions has not been fully resolved yet, owing to the wide variety of possible structures including bulk Ga2O3 aggregates on the external zeolite surface, small gallium oxide aggregates occluded in the zeolite micropore space, reduced Ga species such as Ga2O and cationic Ga species in oxidized or reduced form."

[2] "A previous Ga K edge XAS study [10] indicated that the oxidation state of the reduced Ga species changes upon cooling indicating that in situ studies at relatively high temperatures are a prerequisite."

[3] "Here, we report an in situ X-ray absorption near-edge spectroscopy (XANES) study of the thermal activation of these species."

[4] "Therefore, we studied the catalytic materials by XANES under conditions relevant to catalysis."

[1] "Here, we describe studies of the physical and chemical state of Ga using in-situ X-ray absorption at the Ga K-edge."

[2] "Reduced Ga is present in highly dispersed form without Ga nearest neighbors, probably as a monomeric hydride species coordinated to basic oxygens within zeolite channels."

[3] "Reduced Ga species reoxidize to Ga+3 when samples are cooled to room temperature in flowing H2, suggesting that active forms of Ga exist only at reaction conditions."

[4] "This work illustrates the critical need for in-situ techniques to establish the chemical form of catalytic sites and the misleading conclusions that can arise from the exclusive use of pre- and postreaction characterization to suggest the nature of the catatlytic sites."

[5] "Ga+3 species initially present in fresh catalysts reduce at temperatures below 770 K during hydrogen pretreatment or propane reactions."

[1] "Elucidating the Ga speciation on Ga/H-ZSM-5 at PDH conditions is a prerequisite for understanding the structureactivity relations. This is, however, far from trivial. PDH produces hydrogen, so the catalyst operates in a reducing environment (typically above 500 C)."

[2] "Thus, only characterizations conducted in situ/operando or at least on reduced Ga/H-ZSM-5 could provide relevant information regarding the speciation of Ga on the catalyst during PDH."

[3] "PDH on Ga/H-ZSM-5 occurs at high temperatures (typically >500C), and thus reaction intermediates are short-lived and difficult to detect experimentally."

[4] "X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) could be conducted in situ or operando, and thus is well suited for determining the Ga speciation in Ga/H-ZSM-5 at PDH conditions."

[5] "The chemical specificity of FTIR spectroscopy makes it well-suited for identifying reaction intermediates."

[6] "Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts are commonly prepared by impregnating a Ga salt, for example, Ga(NO3)3, on the H-ZSM-5 support, followed by calcination in the air. At this point, Ga in the as-synthesized Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalyst is typically at its highest oxidation state, that is, +3. Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts are then reduced in an H2 atmosphere at the reaction temperature before the feed is introduced."

[1] "Determining the role of gallium species in these reactions has proven difficult, as the nature of the active species remains unclear, mainly because the active gallium species is highly dispersed and only present under reaction (reductive) conditions."

[2] "In this sense, X-ray absorption techniques are extremely useful as they allow the detection of dispersed and even isolated species and were already used in the literature in order to study this system."

[3] "In situ gallium K edge XAFS spectroscopy experiments were performed with GaZSM5 catalysts containing two different gallium loadings (2 and 4%) under hydrogen or propane in the 703823K temperature range."

[4] "It was found that, irrespective of the gallium loading and reducing gas, linear correlations were found between the coordination numbers of both the first (GaO scattering legs) and second (GaGa scattering legs) gallium coordination spheres estimated from EXAFS and the degree of reduction estimated by XANES."

[5] "Comparison between gallium K edge XANES and EXAFS results showed that reduced gallium species, generally held responsible for aromatization activity in gallium modified ZSM5 catalysts, are indeed isolated gallium atoms (Ga+) probably at zeolite ion exchange positions, bound to a framework oxygen atom (SiOAl)."

[6] "The results showed that the reduction proceeds from Ga3+ binuclear species 4-fold coordinated to oxygen to an isolated Ga+ ion coordinated to a single oxygen atom."

[1] "While the role of gallium cations in alkane activation is well known, the oxidation state and coordination environment of gallium under reaction conditions has been the subject of debate."

[2] "Edge shifts in Ga K-edge XANES spectra acquired under reaction conditions have long been interpreted as evidence for reduction of Ga(III) to Ga(I). However, a change in oxidation state is not the only factor that can give rise to a change in the XANES spectrum."

[3] "We demonstrate that changes in the identity and number of gallium nearest neighbors can give rise to changes in XANES spectra similar to those attributed in literature to changes in oxidation state. Specifically, spectral features previously attributed to Ga(I) may be equally well interpreted as evidence for low-coordinate Ga(III) alkyl or hydride species."

[4] "In order to better understand the XANES spectra of working catalysts, we have synthesized a series of molecular model compounds and grafted surface organometallic Ga species and compared their XANES spectra to those of gallium-based catalysts acquired under reducing conditions."

[5] "Given the long-standing interest in understanding and exploiting mechanisms for selective functionalization of alkanes, it is of significance to establish whether the mechanism of Câ€“H bond activation is redox or non-redox in nature."

[1] "Ga speciation under reaction conditions remains controversial."

[2] "Various experimental techniques including in-situ Ga K edge X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES), ex-situ FTIR and NH3-temperature-programmed desorption (NH3-TPD) have been employed to probe Ga speciation in Ga/H-ZSM-5 and identify the active site in the PDH reaction"

[3] "Early in-situ X-ray absorption study showed that isolated Ga+ ions are the main species in Ga/H-ZSM-5 independent of the gallium loading and the utilized reducing gas"

[4] "Alternative interpretations of edge shifts in Ga K-edge XANES spectra acquired under reaction conditions have been proposed, as XANES spectra are not sufficiently resolved to differentiate Ga+ from low-coordinate Ga-alkyl or hydride species"

[5] "In this work, in-situ transmission Fourier Transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy is employed to systematically investigate Ga speciation in Ga/H-ZSM-5 with three Si/Al ratios (15, 28 and 39) and a wide range of Ga/Al ratios (01.7)."

[6] "These results provide direct experimental evidence for the existence of two types of Ga species on reduced Ga/H-ZSM-5, highlighting the possibility that they have different catalytic activities in alkane dehydrogenation reactions."

[1] "The state of gallium in these catalysts has not been elucidated yet."
          [2] "In the present study we investigated the state of gallium in reduced Ga/HZSM-5 zeolite by highly sensitive DRIFT spectroscopy using adsorbed CO as a molecular probe."
          [3] "The high mobility of gallium upon reduction is believed to be connected to the formation of unstable gaseous Ga2O oxide [5,6]. Subsequently, this oxide can react with acid protons in the zeolite micropores"
          [4] "It has been put forward that univalent Ga+ cations are highly unstable [2,7]. Cooling a reduced sample in a hydrogen atmosphere to room temperature would result in the oxidation of Ga+ by traces of residual water or framework oxygen atoms with formation of (Ga(OH)2)+, (GaO)+ or even Ga2O3 species."
          [5] "The most extensive in situ study of the state of gallium in the working GaZSM-5 catalyst for propane aromatization has been carried out in Refs. [24,7]. The authors interpreted X-ray absorption data in the following way."

[1] "The structure of the active intrazeolite Ga species and their reactivity in oxidative and reductive conditions has not been fully resolved yet, owing to the wide variety of possible structures including bulk Ga2O3 aggregates on the external zeolite surface, small gallium oxide aggregates occluded in the zeolite micropore space, reduced Ga species such as Ga2O and cationic Ga species in oxidized or reduced form."
