[1] "With the ethylene and gasoline being the main products from SC and conventional FCC, respectively, propylene and other light olefins are obtained as byproducts from these technologies."

[2] "Recently, market analysis show that the demand for propylene is outpacing that of ethylene and the current supply cannot match the demand."

[3] "With on purpose propylene production technologies, such as propane dehydrogenation and metathesis being touted as possible alternatives, the cost associated with these technologies remains less competitive relative to steam crackers and FCC."

[4] "It could have been easier to fill the gap by reconfiguring the steam cracker, but the steam cracker does not provide flexibility of operation and it has high energy consumption."

The literature does not provide specific information about the development of propane dehydrogenation (PDH) methods or Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts for PDH. The document focuses primarily on fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) and steam cracking (SC) technologies for propylene production. It mentions that propane dehydrogenation is one of the "on purpose" propylene production technologies, but does not go into detail about its development or catalysts used.

The growing demand for propylene has influenced the development of new production methods in several ways:

1. There is increased focus on maximizing propylene production from existing FCC units, as the demand for propylene is outpacing that of ethylene.

2. New technologies and modifications to FCC units are being developed to increase propylene yield, such as Deep Catalytic Cracking (DCC) and High-Severity Fluid Catalytic Cracking (HSFCC).

3. On-purpose propylene production technologies like propane dehydrogenation and metathesis are being considered as alternatives, although they are currently less cost-competitive compared to steam crackers and FCC.

4. There is a shift away from reconfiguring steam crackers for increased propylene production due to their lack of flexibility and high energy consumption.

The document does not provide information on the evolution of understanding Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts for PDH, active Ga species, or recent research findings related to these catalysts.

该文献没有提供关于丙烷脱氢(PDH)方法或用于PDH的Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂发展的具体信息。该文档主要关注流化催化裂化(FCC)和蒸汽裂解(SC)技术用于丙烯生产。它提到丙烷脱氢是"定向"丙烯生产技术之一，但没有详细介绍其发展或所使用的催化剂。

丙烯需求的增长影响了新生产方法的发展，主要体现在以下几个方面：

1. 由于丙烯的需求超过了乙烯，因此更加注重从现有的FCC装置中最大化丙烯产量。

2. 正在开发新技术和对FCC装置的改进，以提高丙烯产率，如深度催化裂化(DCC)和高严酷度流化催化裂解(HSFCC)。

3. 正在考虑使用定向丙烯生产技术，如丙烷脱氢和复分解反应作为替代方案，尽管目前这些技术与蒸汽裂解和FCC相比成本竞争力较低。

4. 由于蒸汽裂解装置缺乏灵活性和能耗高，正在逐渐放弃重新配置蒸汽裂解装置以增加丙烯产量的做法。

该文档没有提供关于Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂在PDH中的理解演变、活性Ga物种或与这些催化剂相关的最新研究发现的信息。
