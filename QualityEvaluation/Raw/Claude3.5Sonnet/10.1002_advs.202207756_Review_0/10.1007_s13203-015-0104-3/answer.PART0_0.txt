[1] "Recently, market analysis show that the demand for propylene is outpacing that of ethylene and the current supply cannot match the demand."

[2] "With on purpose propylene production technologies, such as propane dehydrogenation and metathesis being touted as possible alternatives, the cost associated with these technologies remains less competitive relative to steam crackers and FCC."

The literature does not provide detailed information about the development of propane dehydrogenation (PDH) methods or Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts for PDH. It only briefly mentions propane dehydrogenation as one of the on-purpose propylene production technologies, but states that its cost remains less competitive compared to steam crackers and FCC. The document focuses more on FCC-based technologies for propylene production and does not discuss the evolution of understanding regarding Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts or recent research findings in this area.

这篇文献没有提供关于丙烷脱氢(PDH)方法或用于PDH的Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂发展的详细信息。它只是简单提到丙烷脱氢是定向生产丙烯的技术之一,但指出其成本相比蒸汽裂解和流化催化裂化仍然缺乏竞争力。该文档更多地关注基于FCC的丙烯生产技术,并没有讨论对Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂的理解演变或该领域的最新研究发现。
