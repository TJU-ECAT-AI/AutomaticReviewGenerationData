[1] "Recently, market analysis show that the demand for propylene is outpacing that of ethylene and the current supply cannot match the demand."

[2] "With on purpose propylene production technologies, such as propane dehydrogenation and metathesis being touted as possible alternatives, the cost associated with these technologies remains less competitive relative to steam crackers and FCC."

[3] "Being an essentially non-catalytic and nonselective process SC is energy intensive and catalysts have never been widely used in the pyrolysis section in SC to optimize energy efficiency."

[4] "The configuration of the FCC process, which involves a circulating fluidized bed with the availability of heat and mass transfer and catalysts regeneration, makes it possible for the FCC to be used for applications that go beyond the upgrading of heavy feed to gasoline."

The literature does not provide specific information about the development of propane dehydrogenation (PDH) methods or the use of Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts for PDH. The document focuses mainly on fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) and its modifications for increasing propylene production.

The growing demand for propylene has led to the exploration of new production methods beyond traditional steam cracking. While propane dehydrogenation is mentioned as an "on purpose" technology for propylene production, the document does not go into detail about its development or the use of specific catalysts like Ga/H-ZSM-5.

The literature indicates that the demand for propylene is outpacing supply, which has driven interest in alternative production methods. However, it notes that technologies like propane dehydrogenation are currently less cost-competitive compared to steam cracking and FCC.

The document emphasizes the potential of modifying FCC processes to increase propylene yields, as FCC offers advantages in terms of flexibility and energy efficiency compared to non-catalytic processes like steam cracking.

该文献并未提供关于丙烷脱氢(PDH)方法的开发或Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂在PDH中的使用的具体信息。该文档主要关注流化催化裂化(FCC)及其增加丙烯产量的改进。

丙烯需求的增长导致了对传统蒸汽裂解以外的新生产方法的探索。虽然丙烷脱氢被提及为"定向"丙烯生产技术，但该文档并未详细介绍其发展或特定催化剂如Ga/H-ZSM-5的使用。

文献指出，丙烯的需求正在超过供应，这推动了对替代生产方法的兴趣。然而，它指出像丙烷脱氢这样的技术目前在成本竞争力上不如蒸汽裂解和FCC。

该文档强调了修改FCC工艺以提高丙烯产率的潜力，因为与非催化工艺（如蒸汽裂解）相比，FCC在灵活性和能源效率方面具有优势。
