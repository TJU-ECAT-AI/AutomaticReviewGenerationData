[1] "With on purpose propylene production technologies, such as propane dehydrogenation and metathesis being touted as possible alternatives, the cost associated with these technologies remains less competitive relative to steam crackers and FCC."

[2] "Recently, market analysis show that the demand for propylene is outpacing that of ethylene and the current supply cannot match the demand."

[3] "SC alone cannot satisfy the demand for propylene. Therefore, there is need of new technology to produce additional propylene to bridge the gap between supply and demand."

The growing demand for propylene has led to increased interest in new production methods, including propane dehydrogenation (PDH). However, the literature does not provide specific information about the evolution of Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts for PDH or recent research findings related to these catalysts. The document focuses more broadly on fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) technology for propylene production, mentioning that on-purpose technologies like PDH are being considered as alternatives, but are currently less cost-competitive compared to steam crackers and FCC. The literature emphasizes the need for new technologies to bridge the gap between propylene supply and demand, as steam cracking alone cannot meet the growing demand.

丙烯需求的增长推动了新生产方法的兴起，包括丙烷脱氢(PDH)。然而，文献并未提供关于Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂在PDH中的演变或相关的最新研究发现的具体信息。文档更多地关注了用于丙烯生产的流化催化裂化(FCC)技术，提到PDH等定向生产技术正被考虑作为替代方案，但目前相比蒸汽裂解和FCC而言成本竞争力较低。文献强调需要新技术来弥合丙烯供需之间的差距，因为单靠蒸汽裂解无法满足日益增长的需求。
