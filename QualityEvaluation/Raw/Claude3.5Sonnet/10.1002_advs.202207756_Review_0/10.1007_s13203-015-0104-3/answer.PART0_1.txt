[1] "Recently, market analysis show that the demand for propylene is outpacing that of ethylene and the current supply cannot match the demand."

[2] "With on purpose propylene production technologies, such as propane dehydrogenation and metathesis being touted as possible alternatives, the cost associated with these technologies remains less competitive relative to steam crackers and FCC."

[3] "Global propylene demand trends remain strong, and with the change toward lighter feedstocks in modern steam crackers there will be a growing dependence on the FCC to balance the supply side of the propylene equation."

The literature does not provide detailed information about propane dehydrogenation (PDH) or Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts for PDH. It only briefly mentions propane dehydrogenation as one of the "on purpose" propylene production technologies, along with metathesis. The document focuses more on fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) as a method to increase propylene production. It notes that the demand for propylene is growing faster than supply, and that while PDH is a possible alternative, it is currently less cost-competitive compared to steam crackers and FCC. The literature suggests that FCC will play an increasingly important role in meeting propylene demand, especially as steam crackers shift to lighter feedstocks that produce less propylene.

该文献没有提供关于丙烷脱氢(PDH)或用于PDH的Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂的详细信息。它只是简单地提到丙烷脱氢是"定向"丙烯生产技术之一,与烯烃复分解并列。文档更多地关注流化催化裂化(FCC)作为增加丙烯产量的方法。文献指出,丙烯的需求增长速度快于供应,虽然PDH是一种可能的替代方案,但目前与蒸汽裂解和FCC相比,成本竞争力较低。文献表明,FCC将在满足丙烯需求方面发挥越来越重要的作用,特别是随着蒸汽裂解转向生产较少丙烯的轻质原料。
