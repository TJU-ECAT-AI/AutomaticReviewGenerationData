          [1] "Recently, market analysis show that the demand for propylene is outpacing that of ethylene and the current supply cannot match the demand."

          [2] "With on purpose propylene production technologies, such as propane dehydrogenation and metathesis being touted as possible alternatives, the cost associated with these technologies remains less competitive relative to steam crackers and FCC."

          [3] "Global propylene demand trends remain strong, and with the change toward lighter feedstocks in modern steam crackers there will be a growing dependence on the FCC to balance the supply side of the propylene equation."

          [4] "SC alone cannot satisfy the demand for propylene. Therefore, there is need of new technology to produce additional propylene to bridge the gap between supply and demand."

          [5] "It could have been easier to fill the gap by reconfiguring the steam cracker, but the steam cracker does not provide flexibility of operation and it has high energy consumption."

          [6] "Being an essentially non-catalytic and nonselective process SC is energy intensive and catalysts have never been widely used in the pyrolysis section in SC to optimize energy efficiency."

          [7] "The configuration of the FCC process, which involves a circulating fluidized bed with the availability of heat and mass transfer and catalysts regeneration, makes it possible for the FCC to be used for applications that go beyond the upgrading of heavy feed to gasoline."

          The growing demand for propylene has significantly influenced the development of new production methods, particularly propane dehydrogenation (PDH). The literature indicates that the demand for propylene is outpacing supply, which has driven interest in alternative production methods. PDH is mentioned as one of the "on purpose" propylene production technologies, along with metathesis, being considered as alternatives to traditional methods.

          However, the document does not provide detailed information about the development of PDH methods or the use of Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts for PDH. It notes that while PDH is a possible alternative, it is currently less cost-competitive compared to steam crackers and fluid catalytic cracking (FCC).

          The literature suggests that FCC will play an increasingly important role in meeting propylene demand, especially as steam crackers shift to lighter feedstocks that produce less propylene. There is increased focus on maximizing propylene production from existing FCC units, and new technologies and modifications to FCC units are being developed to increase propylene yield.

          The document emphasizes the need for new technologies to bridge the gap between propylene supply and demand, as steam cracking alone cannot meet the growing demand. It also notes that reconfiguring steam crackers for increased propylene production is not ideal due to their lack of flexibility and high energy consumption.

          Regarding the understanding of Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts for PDH, the evolution of active Ga species, and recent research findings, the provided literature does not offer any specific information on these topics.

          丙烯需求的增长显著影响了新生产方法的开发，特别是丙烷脱氢（PDH）。文献表明，丙烯的需求正在超过供应，这推动了对替代生产方法的兴趣。PDH被提及为"定向"丙烯生产技术之一，与复分解反应一起被视为传统方法的替代方案。

          然而，该文档并未提供关于PDH方法开发或Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂在PDH中使用的详细信息。它指出，虽然PDH是一种可能的替代方案，但目前与蒸汽裂解和流化催化裂化（FCC）相比，其成本竞争力较低。

          文献表明，FCC将在满足丙烯需求方面发挥越来越重要的作用，特别是随着蒸汽裂解转向生产较少丙烯的轻质原料。目前更加注重从现有的FCC装置中最大化丙烯产量，并且正在开发新技术和对FCC装置的改进，以提高丙烯产率。

          文档强调需要新技术来弥合丙烯供需之间的差距，因为单靠蒸汽裂解无法满足日益增长的需求。它还指出，由于蒸汽裂解装置缺乏灵活性和能耗高，重新配置蒸汽裂解装置以增加丙烯产量并不理想。

          关于Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂在PDH中的理解、活性Ga物种的演变以及最新研究发现，所提供的文献并未提供任何具体信息。
