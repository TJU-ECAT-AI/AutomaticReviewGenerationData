The literature does not directly address the growing demand for propylene or the evolution of understanding of Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts for PDH. However, it does provide information on the importance of PDH as an alternative to oil-based cracking processes for propene production and the development of new catalysts to address environmental concerns.

The document mentions that PDH is an important alternative to oil-based cracking processes for producing propene, which is described as an industrially important platform chemical. This suggests that there is a need for alternative production methods, likely due to growing demand.

The literature discusses issues with current commercial PDH technologies using Cr-containing or Pt-containing catalysts, citing toxicity and environmental concerns. To address these problems, the researchers introduce a new method for preparing environmentally compatible catalysts based on commercial ZnO.

The developed ZnO-based catalyst is reported to have about three times higher propene productivity compared to an analogue of commercial KCrOx/Al2O3 catalyst, while maintaining similar propene selectivity.

The document does not provide any information on Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts, their active species, or recent research findings related to these catalysts.

文献并未直接讨论丙烯需求的增长或Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂在PDH中的理解演变。然而，它确实提供了关于PDH作为油基裂解工艺替代方案的重要性以及为解决环境问题而开发新型催化剂的信息。

文献提到PDH是生产丙烯的油基裂解工艺的重要替代方法，并将丙烯描述为工业上重要的平台化学品。这表明确实存在对替代生产方法的需求，很可能是由于需求的增长。

文献讨论了当前使用含铬或含铂催化剂的商业PDH技术存在的问题，包括毒性和环境问题。为解决这些问题，研究人员引入了一种基于商业ZnO的环境友好型催化剂制备方法。

据报道，开发的基于ZnO的催化剂与商业KCrOx/Al2O3催化剂的类似物相比，丙烯生产率提高了约三倍，同时保持了相似的丙烯选择性。

文献没有提供任何关于Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂、其活性物种或与这些催化剂相关的最新研究发现的信息。
