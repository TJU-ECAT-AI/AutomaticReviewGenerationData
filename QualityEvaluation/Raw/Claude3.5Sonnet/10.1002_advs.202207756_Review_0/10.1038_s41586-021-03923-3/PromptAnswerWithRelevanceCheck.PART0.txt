提供的文献并未直接讨论Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂在PDH中的理解演变或关于活性Ga物种的持续争论。然而，它确实提供了一些关于丙烯新生产方法开发的见解，特别是PDH。

丙烯需求的增长导致了PDH作为油基裂解工艺的重要替代方法的发展。这种转变是由于需要更高效和环境友好的方法来生产这种工业上重要的平台化学品。

文献提到，目前使用含铬或含铂催化剂的商业PDH技术存在缺点，包括毒性和使用有害化学品进行催化剂再生。这促使研究人员开发新的、更环境兼容的催化剂。

文章介绍了一种基于商业ZnO制备负载型催化剂的新方法，该方法解决了现有PDH催化剂的一些环境问题。这种新型催化剂显示出良好的前景，与传统催化剂相比，丙烯生产率提高了约三倍，同时保持了相似的丙烯选择性。

虽然文献并未特别讨论Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂，但它展示了持续改进PDH技术和开发更有效、更环保的丙烯生产催化剂的努力。

The literature provided does not directly address the evolution of understanding of Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts for PDH or the ongoing debate about active Ga species. However, it does discuss the development of new production methods for propylene, particularly focusing on propane dehydrogenation (PDH).

The growing demand for propylene has led to the development of PDH as an important alternative to oil-based cracking processes. This shift is driven by the need to produce propylene, which is described as an industrially important platform chemical.

The literature mentions that current commercial PDH technologies use Cr-containing or Pt-containing catalysts, but these have environmental drawbacks. Cr(VI) compounds are toxic, and Pt-containing catalysts require ecologically harmful chlorine for regeneration.

In response to these issues, the authors introduce a new method for preparing environmentally compatible catalysts based on commercial ZnO. This development represents an effort to address the environmental concerns associated with existing PDH catalysts while maintaining or improving performance.

The new ZnO-based catalyst developed by the authors shows promising results, with about three times higher propene productivity at similar propene selectivity compared to a commercial KCrOx/Al2O3 catalyst under industrially relevant conditions.

While the literature does not specifically discuss Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts or the debate about active Ga species, it does highlight the ongoing research and development in the field of PDH catalysts, driven by the need for more efficient and environmentally friendly propylene production methods.

所提供的文献并未直接涉及Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂在PDH中的理解演变或关于活性Ga物种的持续争论。然而，它确实讨论了丙烯生产新方法的开发，特别是集中在丙烷脱氢（PDH）上。

丙烯需求的增长促使PDH成为基于石油的裂解工艺的重要替代方案。这种转变是由生产丙烯的需求驱动的，丙烯被描述为工业上重要的平台化学品。

文献提到，目前商业PDH技术使用含Cr或含Pt的催化剂，但这些催化剂存在环境问题。Cr(VI)化合物具有毒性，而含Pt的催化剂需要使用对生态有害的氯进行再生。

为了应对这些问题，作者引入了一种基于商业ZnO制备环境兼容催化剂的新方法。这一发展代表了在保持或提高性能的同时解决现有PDH催化剂环境问题的努力。

作者开发的新型ZnO基催化剂显示出有希望的结果，在工业相关条件下，与商业KCrOx/Al2O3催化剂相比，丙烯生产率提高了约三倍，而丙烯选择性相似。

虽然文献没有具体讨论Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂或关于活性Ga物种的争论，但它确实强调了PDH催化剂领域正在进行的研究和开发，这是由更高效和环境友好的丙烯生产方法的需求驱动的。
