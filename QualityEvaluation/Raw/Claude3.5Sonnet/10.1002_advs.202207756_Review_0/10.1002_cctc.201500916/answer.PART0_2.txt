[1] "Propylene is a key building block in the synthesis of a large number of chemicals such as poly(propylene), acrylonitrile, and propylene oxide. The global consumption of propylene reached 90million tons in 2015 and its market is still growing."

[2] "With the influx of new supplies of light gases in North America owing to hydraulic fracturing and because catalytic dehydrogenation has been demonstrated to be an effective method to produce unsaturated short-chain hydrocarbons on a commercial scale, catalytic propane dehydrogenation (PDH) is attracting significant attention as a means to fill the supply-demand gap."

The growing demand for propylene has led to increased interest in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) as a production method. This is driven by several factors:

1. Propylene's importance as a key chemical building block for various products.
2. Increasing global consumption of propylene, which reached 90 million tons in 2015 and continues to grow.
3. The availability of new light gas supplies in North America due to hydraulic fracturing.
4. The proven effectiveness of catalytic dehydrogenation for producing short-chain unsaturated hydrocarbons on a commercial scale.

PDH is seen as a promising method to address the supply-demand gap in propylene production. However, the provided literature does not contain specific information about the evolution of understanding Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts for PDH, the debate about active Ga species, or recent research findings related to these catalysts. The focus of the given text is primarily on In-Ga-Al mixed oxide catalysts rather than Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts.

丙烯需求的增长导致了人们对丙烷脱氢(PDH)作为生产方法的兴趣增加。这是由以下几个因素驱动的：

1. 丙烯作为各种产品的关键化学原料的重要性。
2. 丙烯的全球消费量不断增加，2015年达到9000万吨，并持续增长。
3. 由于水力压裂技术，北美地区出现了新的轻质气体供应。
4. 催化脱氢已被证明是在商业规模上生产短链不饱和烃的有效方法。

PDH被视为解决丙烯生产供需缺口的有前景的方法。然而，所提供的文献并不包含关于Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂在PDH中的理解演变、活性Ga物种的争论或与这些催化剂相关的最新研究发现的具体信息。给定文本的重点主要是In-Ga-Al混合氧化物催化剂，而不是Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂。
