[1] "Propylene is a key building block in the synthesis of a large number of chemicals such as poly(propylene), acrylonitrile, and propylene oxide. The global consumption of propylene reached 90million tons in 2015 and its market is still growing."

[2] "With the influx of new supplies of light gases in North America owing to hydraulic fracturing and because catalytic dehydrogenation has been demonstrated to be an effective method to produce unsaturated short-chain hydrocarbons on a commercial scale, catalytic propane dehydrogenation (PDH) is attracting significant attention as a means to fill the supply-demand gap."

The growing demand for propylene has significantly influenced the development of new production methods, particularly propane dehydrogenation (PDH). As global propylene consumption reached 90 million tons in 2015 and continues to grow, there has been increased pressure to find efficient production methods to meet this demand. The influx of light gases from hydraulic fracturing in North America has made PDH an attractive option for filling the supply-demand gap.

However, the literature provided does not contain specific information about the evolution of understanding Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts for PDH or the ongoing debate about active Ga species. There is no mention of recent research findings related to these catalysts. The focus of the given text is more on the general context of propylene demand and the emergence of PDH as a potential solution, rather than on specific catalyst developments.

丙烯需求的增长显著影响了新生产方法的发展，特别是丙烷脱氢(PDH)。随着全球丙烯消费量在2015年达到9000万吨并持续增长，寻找高效生产方法以满足这一需求的压力也在增加。北美水力压裂带来的轻质气体的涌入使PDH成为填补供需缺口的一个有吸引力的选择。

然而，所提供的文献中并不包含关于理解Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂用于PDH的演变或关于活性Ga物种的持续争论的具体信息。也没有提到与这些催化剂相关的最新研究发现。给定文本的重点更多地集中在丙烯需求的一般背景和PDH作为潜在解决方案的出现，而不是具体的催化剂发展。

The growing demand for propylene has led to increased interest in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) as a production method. This is driven by several factors:

1. Propylene's importance as a key chemical building block for various products.
2. Increasing global consumption of propylene, which reached 90 million tons in 2015 and continues to grow.
3. The availability of new light gas supplies in North America due to hydraulic fracturing.
4. The proven effectiveness of catalytic dehydrogenation for producing short-chain unsaturated hydrocarbons on a commercial scale.

PDH is seen as a promising method to address the supply-demand gap in propylene production. However, the provided literature does not contain specific information about the evolution of understanding Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts for PDH, the debate about active Ga species, or recent research findings related to these catalysts. The focus of the given text is primarily on In-Ga-Al mixed oxide catalysts rather than Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts.

丙烯需求的增长导致了人们对丙烷脱氢(PDH)作为生产方法的兴趣增加。这是由以下几个因素驱动的：

1. 丙烯作为各种产品的关键化学原料的重要性。
2. 丙烯的全球消费量不断增加，2015年达到9000万吨，并持续增长。
3. 由于水力压裂技术，北美地区出现了新的轻质气体供应。
4. 催化脱氢已被证明是在商业规模上生产短链不饱和烃的有效方法。

PDH被视为解决丙烯生产供需缺口的有前景的方法。然而，所提供的文献并不包含关于Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂在PDH中的理解演变、活性Ga物种的争论或与这些催化剂相关的最新研究发现的具体信息。给定文本的重点主要是In-Ga-Al混合氧化物催化剂，而不是Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂。

The growing demand for propylene has significantly influenced the development of new production methods, particularly propane dehydrogenation (PDH). As global consumption of propylene reached 90 million tons in 2015 and continues to grow, there is an increasing need for efficient production methods. PDH has gained attention as a means to fill the supply-demand gap, especially with the influx of new light gas supplies in North America due to hydraulic fracturing.

The development of PDH has been driven by its effectiveness in producing unsaturated short-chain hydrocarbons on a commercial scale. This method has become particularly attractive as it allows for the utilization of abundant propane resources to meet the growing propylene demand.

However, the literature provided does not contain specific information about the evolution of understanding Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts for PDH or the ongoing debate about active Ga species. The document focuses more on In2O3-Ga2O3-Al2O3 mixed oxide catalysts rather than Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts. Therefore, I cannot provide information on the recent research findings or current knowledge specifically related to Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts for PDH based on this text.

丙烯需求的增长显著影响了新生产方法的发展，特别是丙烷脱氢（PDH）。随着全球丙烯消费量在2015年达到9000万吨并持续增长，对高效生产方法的需求日益增加。PDH作为填补供需缺口的一种方法受到了广泛关注，特别是在北美由于水力压裂而出现新的轻质气体供应的背景下。

PDH的发展得益于其在商业规模上有效生产不饱和短链烃的能力。这种方法变得特别具有吸引力，因为它允许利用丰富的丙烷资源来满足不断增长的丙烯需求。

然而，提供的文献中并没有包含关于Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂在PDH中的理解演变或关于活性Ga物种的持续争论的具体信息。该文档更多地关注In2O3-Ga2O3-Al2O3混合氧化物催化剂，而不是Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂。因此，基于这篇文本，我无法提供有关Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂在PDH中的最新研究发现或当前知识的信息。
