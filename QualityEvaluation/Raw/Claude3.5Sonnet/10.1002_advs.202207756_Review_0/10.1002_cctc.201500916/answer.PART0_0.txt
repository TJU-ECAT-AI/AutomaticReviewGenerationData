[1] "Propylene is a key building block in the synthesis of a large number of chemicals such as poly(propylene), acrylonitrile, and propylene oxide. The global consumption of propylene reached 90million tons in 2015 and its market is still growing."

[2] "With the influx of new supplies of light gases in North America owing to hydraulic fracturing and because catalytic dehydrogenation has been demonstrated to be an effective method to produce unsaturated short-chain hydrocarbons on a commercial scale, catalytic propane dehydrogenation (PDH) is attracting significant attention as a means to fill the supply-demand gap."

The growing demand for propylene has significantly influenced the development of new production methods, particularly propane dehydrogenation (PDH). As global propylene consumption reached 90 million tons in 2015 and continues to grow, there has been increased pressure to find efficient production methods to meet this demand. The influx of light gases from hydraulic fracturing in North America has made PDH an attractive option for filling the supply-demand gap.

However, the literature provided does not contain specific information about the evolution of understanding Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts for PDH or the ongoing debate about active Ga species. There is no mention of recent research findings related to these catalysts. The focus of the given text is more on the general context of propylene demand and the emergence of PDH as a potential solution, rather than on specific catalyst developments.

丙烯需求的增长显著影响了新生产方法的发展，特别是丙烷脱氢(PDH)。随着全球丙烯消费量在2015年达到9000万吨并持续增长，寻找高效生产方法以满足这一需求的压力也在增加。北美水力压裂带来的轻质气体的涌入使PDH成为填补供需缺口的一个有吸引力的选择。

然而，所提供的文献中并不包含关于理解Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂用于PDH的演变或关于活性Ga物种的持续争论的具体信息。也没有提到与这些催化剂相关的最新研究发现。给定文本的重点更多地集中在丙烯需求的一般背景和PDH作为潜在解决方案的出现，而不是具体的催化剂发展。
