[1] "Propylene is a key building block in the synthesis of a large number of chemicals such as poly(propylene), acrylonitrile, and propylene oxide. The global consumption of propylene reached 90million tons in 2015 and its market is still growing."

[2] "With the influx of new supplies of light gases in North America owing to hydraulic fracturing and because catalytic dehydrogenation has been demonstrated to be an effective method to produce unsaturated short-chain hydrocarbons on a commercial scale, catalytic propane dehydrogenation (PDH) is attracting significant attention as a means to fill the supply-demand gap."

The growing demand for propylene has significantly influenced the development of new production methods, particularly propane dehydrogenation (PDH). As global propylene consumption reached 90 million tons in 2015 and continues to grow, there is an increasing need for efficient production methods. The influx of light gases in North America due to hydraulic fracturing has made PDH an attractive option to meet the supply-demand gap.

The literature provided does not contain specific information about the evolution of understanding Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts for PDH or the ongoing debate about active Ga species. It also does not mention recent research findings contributing to our current knowledge of these catalysts. The focus of the given text is primarily on introducing propylene demand and the potential of PDH as a production method.

丙烯需求的增长显著影响了新生产方法的发展，特别是丙烷脱氢（PDH）。随着2015年全球丙烯消费量达到9000万吨并持续增长，对高效生产方法的需求不断增加。由于水力压裂技术导致北美轻质气体供应增加，PDH成为满足供需差距的一个有吸引力的选择。

所提供的文献中没有关于Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂在PDH中的理解演变或活性Ga物种的持续争论的具体信息。它也没有提到对这些催化剂的当前知识有贡献的最新研究发现。给定文本的重点主要是介绍丙烯需求和PDH作为生产方法的潜力。
