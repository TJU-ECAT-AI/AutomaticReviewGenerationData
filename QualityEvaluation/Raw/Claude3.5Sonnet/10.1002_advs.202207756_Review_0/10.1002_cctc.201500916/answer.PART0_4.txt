[1] "Propylene is a key building block in the synthesis of a large number of chemicals such as poly(propylene), acrylonitrile, and propylene oxide. The global consumption of propylene reached 90million tons in 2015 and its market is still growing."

[2] "With the influx of new supplies of light gases in North America owing to hydraulic fracturing and because catalytic dehydrogenation has been demonstrated to be an effective method to produce unsaturated short-chain hydrocarbons on a commercial scale, catalytic propane dehydrogenation (PDH) is attracting significant attention as a means to fill the supply-demand gap."

The growing demand for propylene has significantly influenced the development of new production methods, particularly propane dehydrogenation (PDH). As global consumption of propylene reached 90 million tons in 2015 and continues to grow, there is an increasing need for efficient production methods. PDH has gained attention as a means to fill the supply-demand gap, especially with the influx of new light gas supplies in North America due to hydraulic fracturing.

The development of PDH has been driven by its effectiveness in producing unsaturated short-chain hydrocarbons on a commercial scale. This method has become particularly attractive as it allows for the utilization of abundant propane resources to meet the growing propylene demand.

However, the literature provided does not contain specific information about the evolution of understanding Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts for PDH or the ongoing debate about active Ga species. The document focuses more on In2O3-Ga2O3-Al2O3 mixed oxide catalysts rather than Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts. Therefore, I cannot provide information on the recent research findings or current knowledge specifically related to Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts for PDH based on this text.

丙烯需求的增长显著影响了新生产方法的发展，特别是丙烷脱氢（PDH）。随着全球丙烯消费量在2015年达到9000万吨并持续增长，对高效生产方法的需求日益增加。PDH作为填补供需缺口的一种方法受到了广泛关注，特别是在北美由于水力压裂而出现新的轻质气体供应的背景下。

PDH的发展得益于其在商业规模上有效生产不饱和短链烃的能力。这种方法变得特别具有吸引力，因为它允许利用丰富的丙烷资源来满足不断增长的丙烯需求。

然而，提供的文献中并没有包含关于Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂在PDH中的理解演变或关于活性Ga物种的持续争论的具体信息。该文档更多地关注In2O3-Ga2O3-Al2O3混合氧化物催化剂，而不是Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂。因此，基于这篇文本，我无法提供有关Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂在PDH中的最新研究发现或当前知识的信息。
