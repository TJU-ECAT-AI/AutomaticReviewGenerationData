[1] "Propylene is a key building block in the synthesis of a large number of chemicals such as poly(propylene), acrylonitrile, and propylene oxide. The global consumption of propylene reached 90million tons in 2015 and its market is still growing."

[2] "With the influx of new supplies of light gases in North America owing to hydraulic fracturing and because catalytic dehydrogenation has been demonstrated to be an effective method to produce unsaturated short-chain hydrocarbons on a commercial scale, catalytic propane dehydrogenation (PDH) is attracting significant attention as a means to fill the supply-demand gap."

The growing demand for propylene has led to increased interest in developing new production methods, particularly propane dehydrogenation (PDH). The global consumption of propylene reached 90 million tons in 2015 and continues to grow. PDH has gained attention as an effective method to produce propylene on a commercial scale, especially with the increased availability of light gases from hydraulic fracturing in North America.

The literature does not provide specific information about the evolution of understanding Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts for PDH or the ongoing debate about active Ga species. There is no mention of recent research findings contributing to our current knowledge of these catalysts. The focus of the provided text is on In-Ga-Al mixed oxide catalysts rather than Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts.

丙烯需求的增长推动了新生产方法的开发，特别是丙烷脱氢（PDH）。2015年全球丙烯消费量达到9000万吨，并且仍在持续增长。PDH作为一种有效的商业规模生产丙烯的方法受到关注，尤其是在北美水力压裂技术带来轻质气体供应增加的背景下。

文献中没有提供关于Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂在PDH中的理解演变或活性Ga物种的持续争论的具体信息。也没有提到近期研究发现对这些催化剂当前知识的贡献。提供的文本主要关注In-Ga-Al混合氧化物催化剂，而不是Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂。
