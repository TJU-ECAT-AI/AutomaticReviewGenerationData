The growing demand for propylene has significantly influenced the development of new production methods, particularly propane dehydrogenation (PDH). The global demand for propylene exceeds 100 million metric tons per year, with a 4% annual growth rate. This increasing demand, coupled with the shift in industrial feedstocks from naphtha to propane due to shale gas production, has led to the rise of PDH as a significant propylene production method.

In 2019, nonoxidative PDH accounted for 11% of global propylene production, producing 13.6 million metric tons. This growth in PDH has driven the development of commercial processes using either chromium-based (Catofin process) or platinum-based catalysts (Oleflex and STAR processes).

However, the literature provided does not contain specific information about Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts for PDH, their active Ga species, or recent research findings related to these catalysts. Therefore, I cannot provide information on the evolution of understanding or ongoing debates about Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts based on this text.

丙烯需求的增长极大地影响了新生产方法的发展，特别是丙烷脱氢（PDH）。全球丙烯需求每年超过1亿吨，年增长率为4%。这种不断增长的需求，加上由于页岩气生产导致的工业原料从石脑油转向丙烷，使PDH成为重要的丙烯生产方法。

2019年，非氧化PDH占全球丙烯产量的11%，生产了1360万吨。PDH的这种增长推动了使用铬基（Catofin工艺）或铂基催化剂（Oleflex和STAR工艺）的商业工艺的发展。

然而，提供的文献中不包含关于Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂用于PDH的具体信息，也没有涉及其活性Ga物种或与这些催化剂相关的最新研究发现。因此，我无法基于这篇文本提供关于Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂的理解演变或正在进行的争论的信息。
