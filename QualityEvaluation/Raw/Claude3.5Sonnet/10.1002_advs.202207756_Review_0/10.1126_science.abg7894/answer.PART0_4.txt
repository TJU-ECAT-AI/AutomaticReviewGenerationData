The growing demand for propylene has significantly influenced the development of new production methods, particularly propane dehydrogenation (PDH). With global demand exceeding 100 million metric tons per year and growing at 4% annually, there has been a push to find more efficient production methods. The emergence of shale gas has led to a shift from naphtha to propane as the primary feedstock for propylene production. As a result, PDH has gained importance, producing 13.6 million metric tons of propylene in 2019, which accounted for 11% of global propylene production.

The literature provided does not contain information about Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts for PDH, their active Ga species, or recent research findings related to these catalysts. Therefore, this part of the question cannot be answered based on the given information.

丙烯需求的增长极大地影响了新生产方法的发展，特别是丙烷脱氢（PDH）。全球需求每年超过1亿吨，年增长率为4%，这推动了寻找更高效生产方法的努力。页岩气的出现导致了从石脑油到丙烷作为丙烯生产主要原料的转变。因此，PDH变得越来越重要，2019年生产了1360万吨丙烯，占全球丙烯产量的11%。

提供的文献中没有包含关于Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂用于PDH的信息，也没有提到其活性Ga物种或最近与这些催化剂相关的研究发现。因此，基于给定的信息无法回答问题的这一部分。
