The growing demand for propylene has significantly influenced the development of new production methods, particularly propane dehydrogenation (PDH). The global demand for propylene exceeds 100 million metric tons per year, with a 4% annual growth rate. This increasing demand, coupled with the shift in industrial feedstocks from naphtha to propane due to shale gas production, has driven the development of PDH processes.

PDH has become an important method for propylene production, accounting for 11% of global propylene production in 2019, with 13.6 million metric tons produced. This growth in PDH has led to research efforts focused on developing more efficient and stable catalysts.

The literature does not specifically discuss Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts for PDH or the debate about active Ga species. Instead, it focuses on the development of a new PDH catalyst composed of silica-supported Pt1Sn1 nanoparticles. This catalyst operates at thermodynamically limited conversion levels without requiring hydrogen addition to the feed, while exhibiting excellent stability and high selectivity to propylene (>99%).

While the question asks about Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts, the provided literature does not contain information on this specific catalyst system or the ongoing debate about active Ga species. The research findings presented in the document contribute to our current knowledge of PDH catalysts by introducing a highly efficient Pt-Sn based catalyst, but do not address the Ga/H-ZSM-5 system.

丙烯需求的增长显著影响了新生产方法的开发，特别是丙烷脱氢（PDH）。全球丙烯需求每年超过1亿吨，年增长率为4%。这种不断增长的需求，加上由页岩气生产引起的工业原料从石脑油向丙烷的转变，推动了PDH工艺的发展。

PDH已成为丙烯生产的重要方法，2019年占全球丙烯产量的11%，产量达1360万吨。PDH的这种增长促使研究工作集中在开发更高效和更稳定的催化剂上。

文献中并未具体讨论用于PDH的Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂或关于活性Ga物种的争论。相反，它着重于开发一种新型PDH催化剂，该催化剂由二氧化硅负载的Pt1Sn1纳米粒子组成。这种催化剂在不需要向进料中添加氢气的情况下，在热力学限制的转化水平下运行，同时表现出优异的稳定性和对丙烯的高选择性（>99%）。

虽然问题询问了Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂，但提供的文献中并不包含有关这种特定催化剂系统或关于活性Ga物种的持续争论的信息。文献中呈现的研究结果通过引入一种高效的Pt-Sn基催化剂，为我们对PDH催化剂的当前认知做出了贡献，但并未涉及Ga/H-ZSM-5系统。
