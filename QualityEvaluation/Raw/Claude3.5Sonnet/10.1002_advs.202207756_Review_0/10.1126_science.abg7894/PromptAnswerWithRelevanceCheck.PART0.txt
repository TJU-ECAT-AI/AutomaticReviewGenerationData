[1] "Global demand for propylene is >100 million metric tons per year, with 4% annual growth"

[2] "Nonoxidative propane dehydrogenation (PDH) produced 13.6 million metric tons of propylene in 2019, accounting for 11% of global propylene production"

[3] "Shale gas production has led to a switch in the industrial feedstocks for propylene, from naphtha to propane"

[4] "We developed a PDH catalyst that operates at thermodynamically limited conversion levels without the addition of hydrogen to the feed and exhibits excellent stability and selectivity to propylene (>99%)."

</quotes>

<EnglishVersionAnswer>

The growing demand for propylene has led to increased interest in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) as a production method. PDH has become more attractive due to the switch from naphtha to propane as a feedstock, driven by shale gas production. The global demand for propylene exceeds 100 million metric tons per year and is growing at 4% annually. In 2019, PDH accounted for 11% of global propylene production, producing 13.6 million metric tons.

To meet this growing demand, researchers have focused on developing more efficient PDH catalysts. The literature describes a new PDH catalyst that operates at thermodynamic limits without hydrogen addition, showing excellent stability and selectivity. However, the document does not specifically discuss Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts or the debate about active Ga species. The focus is on platinum-tin catalysts supported on silica, rather than gallium-based catalysts.

丙烯需求的增长推动了丙烷脱氢（PDH）作为生产方法的发展。由于页岩气生产导致原料从石脑油转向丙烷，PDH变得更具吸引力。全球丙烯需求每年超过1亿吨，年增长率为4%。2019年，PDH占全球丙烯产量的11%，产量达1360万吨。

为满足这一不断增长的需求，研究人员致力于开发更高效的PDH催化剂。文献描述了一种新型PDH催化剂，该催化剂在不添加氢气的情况下在热力学极限下运行，显示出优异的稳定性和选择性。然而，该文档并未具体讨论Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂或关于活性Ga物种的争论。文章主要关注的是以二氧化硅为载体的铂-锡催化剂，而非镓基催化剂。

The growing demand for propylene has significantly influenced the development of new production methods, particularly propane dehydrogenation (PDH). The global demand for propylene exceeds 100 million metric tons per year, with a 4% annual growth rate. This increasing demand, coupled with the shift in industrial feedstocks from naphtha to propane due to shale gas production, has driven the development of PDH as a key production method.

PDH has become an important contributor to global propylene production, accounting for 11% (13.6 million metric tons) of the total in 2019. This growth has spurred research into more efficient PDH catalysts and processes. Recent developments have focused on creating catalysts that can operate at thermodynamically limited conversion levels without the need for hydrogen addition, while maintaining excellent stability and high selectivity to propylene (>99%).

The literature provided does not contain specific information about Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts for PDH or the ongoing debate about active Ga species. Therefore, I cannot provide information on how the understanding of these catalysts has evolved or discuss recent research findings related to Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts for PDH.

丙烯需求的增长显著影响了新生产方法的开发，特别是丙烷脱氢（PDH）。全球丙烯需求每年超过1亿吨，年增长率为4%。这种日益增长的需求，加上由于页岩气生产导致的工业原料从石脑油向丙烷的转变，推动了PDH作为一种关键生产方法的发展。

PDH已成为全球丙烯生产的重要贡献者，2019年占总产量的11%（1360万吨）。这种增长推动了对更高效PDH催化剂和工艺的研究。最近的发展集中在创造能够在热力学限制转化水平下运行的催化剂，无需添加氢气，同时保持优异的稳定性和对丙烯的高选择性（>99%）。

提供的文献中没有关于Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂用于PDH的具体信息，也没有关于活性Ga物种的持续争论。因此，我无法提供关于这些催化剂理解如何演变的信息，也无法讨论与Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂用于PDH相关的最新研究发现。

The global demand for propylene exceeds 100 million metric tons per year, with a 4% annual growth rate.

This catalyst operates at thermodynamically limited conversion levels without requiring hydrogen addition to the feed, while exhibiting excellent stability and high selectivity to propylene (>99%).

While the question asks about Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts, the provided literature does not contain information on this specific catalyst system or the ongoing debate about active Ga species. The research findings presented in the document contribute to our current knowledge of PDH catalysts by introducing a highly efficient Pt-Sn based catalyst, but do not address the Ga/H-ZSM-5 system.

丙烯需求的增长显著影响了新生产方法的开发，特别是丙烷脱氢（PDH）。全球丙烯需求每年超过1亿吨，年增长率为4%。这种不断增长的需求，加上由页岩气生产引起的工业原料从石脑油向丙烷的转变，推动了PDH工艺的发展。

PDH已成为丙烯生产的重要方法，2019年占全球丙烯产量的11%，产量达1360万吨。PDH的这种增长促使研究工作集中在开发更高效和更稳定的催化剂上。

文献中并未具体讨论用于PDH的Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂或关于活性Ga物种的争论。相反，它着重于开发一种新型PDH催化剂，该催化剂由二氧化硅负载的Pt1Sn1纳米粒子组成。这种催化剂在不需要向进料中添加氢气的情况下，在热力学限制的转化水平下运行，同时表现出优异的稳定性和对丙烯的高选择性（>99%）。

虽然问题询问了Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂，但提供的文献中并不包含有关这种特定催化剂系统或关于活性Ga物种的持续争论的信息。文献中呈现的研究结果通过引入一种高效的Pt-Sn基催化剂，为我们对PDH催化剂的当前认知做出了贡献，但并未涉及Ga/H-ZSM-5系统。

The growing demand for propylene has significantly influenced the development of new production methods, particularly propane dehydrogenation (PDH). With global demand exceeding 100 million metric tons per year and growing at 4% annually, there has been a push to find more efficient production methods. The emergence of shale gas has led to a shift from naphtha to propane as the primary feedstock for propylene production. As a result, PDH has gained importance, producing 13.6 million metric tons of propylene in 2019, which accounted for 11% of global propylene production.

The literature provided does not contain information about Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts for PDH, their active Ga species, or recent research findings related to these catalysts. Therefore, this part of the question cannot be answered based on the given information.
