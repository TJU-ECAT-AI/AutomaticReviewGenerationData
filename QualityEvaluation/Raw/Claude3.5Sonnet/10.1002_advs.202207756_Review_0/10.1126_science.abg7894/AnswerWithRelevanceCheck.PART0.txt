          The growing demand for propylene has significantly influenced the development of new production methods, particularly propane dehydrogenation (PDH). Global demand for propylene exceeds 100 million metric tons per year, with a 4% annual growth rate. This increasing demand, coupled with the shift in industrial feedstocks from naphtha to propane due to shale gas production, has driven the development of PDH as a key production method.

          PDH has become an important contributor to global propylene production, accounting for 11% (13.6 million metric tons) of the total in 2019. This growth has spurred research into more efficient PDH catalysts and processes. Commercial PDH processes currently utilize either chromium-based (Catofin process) or platinum-based catalysts (Oleflex and STAR processes).

          Recent developments have focused on creating catalysts that can operate at thermodynamically limited conversion levels without the need for hydrogen addition, while maintaining excellent stability and high selectivity to propylene (>99%). One such catalyst is composed of silica-supported Pt1Sn1 nanoparticles, which has shown promising results in terms of stability and selectivity.

          However, the provided literature does not contain specific information about Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts for PDH, the ongoing debate about active Ga species, or recent research findings related to these catalysts. Therefore, the question regarding the evolution of understanding and current knowledge of Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts cannot be answered based on the given information.

          丙烯需求的增长显著影响了新生产方法的开发，特别是丙烷脱氢（PDH）。全球丙烯需求每年超过1亿吨，年增长率为4%。这种不断增长的需求，加上由于页岩气生产导致的工业原料从石脑油向丙烷的转变，推动了PDH作为一种关键生产方法的发展。

          PDH已成为全球丙烯生产的重要贡献者，2019年占总产量的11%（1360万吨）。这种增长推动了对更高效PDH催化剂和工艺的研究。目前商业PDH工艺使用铬基（Catofin工艺）或铂基催化剂（Oleflex和STAR工艺）。

          最近的发展集中在创造能够在热力学限制转化水平下运行的催化剂，无需添加氢气，同时保持优异的稳定性和对丙烯的高选择性（>99%）。其中一种催化剂由二氧化硅负载的Pt1Sn1纳米粒子组成，在稳定性和选择性方面显示出了有希望的结果。

          然而，提供的文献中没有关于Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂用于PDH的具体信息，也没有关于活性Ga物种的持续争论或与这些催化剂相关的最新研究发现。因此，基于给定的信息无法回答关于Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂理解演变和当前知识的问题。
