The growing demand for propylene has significantly influenced the development of new production methods, particularly propane dehydrogenation (PDH). The global demand for propylene exceeds 100 million metric tons per year, with a 4% annual growth rate. This increasing demand, coupled with the shift in industrial feedstocks from naphtha to propane due to shale gas production, has driven the development of PDH as a key production method.

PDH has become an important contributor to global propylene production, accounting for 11% (13.6 million metric tons) of the total in 2019. This growth has spurred research into more efficient PDH catalysts and processes. Recent developments have focused on creating catalysts that can operate at thermodynamically limited conversion levels without the need for hydrogen addition, while maintaining excellent stability and high selectivity to propylene (>99%).

The literature provided does not contain specific information about Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts for PDH or the ongoing debate about active Ga species. Therefore, I cannot provide information on how the understanding of these catalysts has evolved or discuss recent research findings related to Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts for PDH.

丙烯需求的增长显著影响了新生产方法的开发，特别是丙烷脱氢（PDH）。全球丙烯需求每年超过1亿吨，年增长率为4%。这种日益增长的需求，加上由于页岩气生产导致的工业原料从石脑油向丙烷的转变，推动了PDH作为一种关键生产方法的发展。

PDH已成为全球丙烯生产的重要贡献者，2019年占总产量的11%（1360万吨）。这种增长推动了对更高效PDH催化剂和工艺的研究。最近的发展集中在创造能够在热力学限制转化水平下运行的催化剂，无需添加氢气，同时保持优异的稳定性和对丙烯的高选择性（>99%）。

提供的文献中没有关于Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂用于PDH的具体信息，也没有关于活性Ga物种的持续争论。因此，我无法提供关于这些催化剂理解如何演变的信息，也无法讨论与Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂用于PDH相关的最新研究发现。
