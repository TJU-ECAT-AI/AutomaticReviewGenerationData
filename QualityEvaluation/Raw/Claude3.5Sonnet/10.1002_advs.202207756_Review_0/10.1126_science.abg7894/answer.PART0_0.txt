The growing demand for propylene has led to increased interest in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) as a production method. PDH has become more attractive due to the switch from naphtha to propane as a feedstock, driven by shale gas production. The global demand for propylene exceeds 100 million metric tons per year and is growing at 4% annually. In 2019, PDH accounted for 11% of global propylene production, producing 13.6 million metric tons.

To meet this growing demand, researchers have focused on developing more efficient PDH catalysts. The literature describes a new PDH catalyst that operates at thermodynamic limits without hydrogen addition, showing excellent stability and selectivity. However, the document does not specifically discuss Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts or the debate about active Ga species. The focus is on platinum-tin catalysts supported on silica, rather than gallium-based catalysts.

丙烯需求的增长推动了丙烷脱氢（PDH）作为生产方法的发展。由于页岩气生产导致原料从石脑油转向丙烷，PDH变得更具吸引力。全球丙烯需求每年超过1亿吨，年增长率为4%。2019年，PDH占全球丙烯产量的11%，产量达1360万吨。

为满足这一不断增长的需求，研究人员致力于开发更高效的PDH催化剂。文献描述了一种新型PDH催化剂，该催化剂在不添加氢气的情况下在热力学极限下运行，显示出优异的稳定性和选择性。然而，该文档并未具体讨论Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂或关于活性Ga物种的争论。文章主要关注的是以二氧化硅为载体的铂-锡催化剂，而非镓基催化剂。
