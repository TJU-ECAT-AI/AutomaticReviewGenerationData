The growing demand for propylene has led to the development of new production methods, particularly propane dehydrogenation (PDH), which is emerging as an on-purpose propylene production technology. This development has been driven by the significance of propylene in the chemical industry.

The understanding of Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts for PDH has evolved significantly. Recent research by Lercher's group has provided important insights into the mechanism of these catalysts. They found that in Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts, there is a very low enthalpy barrier of 56 kJ·mol^-1 for heterolytically activating the propane C-H bond. This activation occurs on [GaH]2+ species in conjunction with a basic framework oxygen of the Brønsted-acid site.

However, there is an ongoing debate about the nature of the active Ga species. While Lercher's group identified [GaH]2+ as an important active site, other researchers have proposed alternative active species. For instance, Maeno et al. investigated In-CHA catalysts and suggested that [InH2]+ ions are the catalytic active sites for PDH reactions, showing better performance than [GaH]2+ sites.

These findings contribute to our current knowledge of Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts by elucidating potential active sites and reaction mechanisms. However, the debate over the exact nature of the active species continues, highlighting the complexity of these catalytic systems and the need for further research to fully understand their behavior in PDH reactions.

丙烯需求的增长推动了新生产方法的发展，特别是丙烷脱氢(PDH)，它正在成为一种定向丙烯生产技术。这种发展是由丙烯在化学工业中的重要性驱动的。

对Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂在PDH中的理解已经有了显著的进展。Lercher研究组的最新研究为这些催化剂的机理提供了重要见解。他们发现，在Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂中，异裂活化丙烷C-H键的焓垒很低，仅为56 kJ·mol^-1。这种活化发生在[GaH]2+物种上，并与Brønsted酸位的碱性骨架氧协同作用。

然而，关于活性Ga物种的本质仍存在争议。虽然Lercher研究组确定了[GaH]2+是一个重要的活性位，但其他研究人员提出了替代的活性物种。例如，Maeno等人研究了In-CHA催化剂，并认为[InH2]+离子是PDH反应的催化活性位，表现出比[GaH]2+位更好的性能。

这些发现通过阐明潜在的活性位点和反应机理，为我们当前对Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂的认知做出了贡献。然而，关于活性物种确切本质的争论仍在继续，这突显了这些催化体系的复杂性，以及需要进一步研究以充分理解它们在PDH反应中的行为。
