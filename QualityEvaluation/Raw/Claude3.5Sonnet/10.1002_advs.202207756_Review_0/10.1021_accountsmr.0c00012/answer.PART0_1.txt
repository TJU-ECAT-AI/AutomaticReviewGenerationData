The growing demand for propylene has led to the development of new production methods, particularly propane dehydrogenation (PDH). PDH has emerged as a promising on-purpose propylene production technology to meet the increasing demand for this important chemical compound.

The understanding of Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts for PDH has evolved significantly over time. Recent research has contributed to our current knowledge of these catalysts, particularly regarding the nature of active Ga species. Lercher's group made a significant discovery, finding that in Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts, a very low enthalpy barrier of 56 kJ·mol^-1 for heterolytic activation of the propane C-H bond was observed on [GaH]2+ species, working in conjunction with a basic framework oxygen of the Brønsted-acid site.

However, there is still ongoing debate about the exact nature of the active Ga species. While the [GaH]2+ species has been identified as an important active site, other researchers have proposed alternative active species. For instance, Maeno et al. investigated In-CHA catalysts and suggested that [InH2]+ ions are the catalytic active sites for PDH reactions, demonstrating better performance than [GaH]2+ sites.

This ongoing research and debate highlight the complexity of these catalytic systems and the continued efforts to optimize PDH catalysts for improved propylene production.

丙烯需求的增长推动了新生产方法的发展，特别是丙烷脱氢(PDH)。PDH已成为一种有前景的定向丙烯生产技术，以满足对这种重要化学化合物日益增长的需求。

对Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂在PDH中的理解随时间显著演变。近期研究为我们对这些催化剂的当前认知做出了贡献，特别是关于活性Ga物种的本质。Lercher团队做出了重要发现，发现在Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂中，在[GaH]2+物种上观察到丙烷C-H键异裂活化的很低焓垒（56 kJ·mol^-1），这与Brønsted酸位的碱性骨架氧协同工作。

然而，关于活性Ga物种的确切本质仍存在争议。虽然[GaH]2+物种被确定为重要的活性位点，但其他研究人员提出了替代的活性物种。例如，Maeno等人研究了In-CHA催化剂，并提出[InH2]+离子是PDH反应的催化活性位点，表现出比[GaH]2+位点更好的性能。

这些持续的研究和争论突显了这些催化系统的复杂性，以及为改进丙烯生产而优化PDH催化剂的持续努力。
