The growing demand for propylene has led to the development of new production methods, particularly propane dehydrogenation (PDH), which is being developed as an on-purpose propylene production technology. This development is driven by the significance of propylene in the chemical industry.

The understanding of Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts for PDH has evolved significantly. Recent research by Lercher's group has provided important insights into these catalysts. They found that in Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts, there is a very low enthalpy barrier of 56 kJ·mol^-1 for heterolytically activating the propane C-H bond. This activation occurs on [GaH]2+ species in conjunction with a basic framework oxygen of the Brønsted-acid site.

However, there is an ongoing debate about the active Ga species in these catalysts. While Lercher's group identified [GaH]2+ as an important active site, other researchers have proposed alternative active species. For instance, Maeno et al. investigated In-CHA catalysts and suggested that [InH2]+ ions are the catalytic active sites for PDH reactions, claiming they show better performance than [GaH]2+ sites.

These findings contribute to our current knowledge of Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts by highlighting the importance of specific gallium hydride species in the catalytic process, while also indicating that there is still ongoing research and debate about the exact nature and performance of the active sites in these and related catalysts for PDH reactions.

丙烯需求的增长推动了新的生产方法的发展，特别是丙烷脱氢（PDH），它正在作为一种定向丙烯生产技术发展。这一发展是由丙烯在化学工业中的重要性驱动的。

对Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂用于PDH的理解已经有了显著的进展。Lercher小组的最新研究为这些催化剂提供了重要的见解。他们发现，在Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂中，异裂活化丙烷C-H键的焓垒很低，仅为56 kJ·mol^-1。这种活化发生在[GaH]2+物种上，并与Brønsted酸位的碱性骨架氧协同作用。

然而，关于这些催化剂中活性Ga物种的争论仍在继续。虽然Lercher小组确定了[GaH]2+作为重要的活性位点，但其他研究人员提出了替代的活性物种。例如，Maeno等人研究了In-CHA催化剂，并提出[InH2]+离子是PDH反应的催化活性位点，声称它们比[GaH]2+位点表现更好。

这些发现通过强调特定镓氢化物在催化过程中的重要性，为我们当前对Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂的认识做出了贡献，同时也表明关于这些催化剂及相关PDH反应催化剂的确切性质和性能仍在进行研究和争论。
