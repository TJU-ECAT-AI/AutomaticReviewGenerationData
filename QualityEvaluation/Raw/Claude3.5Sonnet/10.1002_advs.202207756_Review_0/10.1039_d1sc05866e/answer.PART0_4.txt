[1] "The increasing world demand for propylene and the current low cost of propane derived from shale gas have renewed interest in the propane dehydrogenation reaction (PDH)."

The growing demand for propylene, coupled with the low cost of propane from shale gas, has led to renewed interest in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) as a production method. This has driven research into various catalysts for PDH, including those based on Ga, Zn, Co, Fe, V, and Zr, as well as nanocarbon catalysts.

Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts have emerged as particularly promising for PDH due to their high stability and propylene selectivity (90%). However, there is ongoing debate about the nature of the active Ga species in these catalysts. Some researchers propose that single [GaH]2+ sites are the active species, while others suggest that Ga+H+ pair sites are the stable active species. Recent research has further complicated this picture, indicating that Ga-exchanged species associated with Al-pairs in Ga/H-MFI zeolites are effective for both propane and butane dehydrogenation, while isolated Ga species are not.

This evolving understanding of Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts highlights the complexity of PDH catalysis and the ongoing efforts to optimize catalyst performance for industrial propylene production.

由于丙烯需求的增长以及页岩气带来的丙烷低成本，人们对丙烷脱氢(PDH)作为一种生产方法重新产生了兴趣。这推动了对各种PDH催化剂的研究，包括基于Ga、Zn、Co、Fe、V和Zr的催化剂，以及纳米碳催化剂。

Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂因其高稳定性和丙烯选择性(90%)而成为PDH特别有前景的催化剂。然而，关于这些催化剂中活性Ga物种的本质，仍存在争议。一些研究人员提出单一的[GaH]2+位点是活性物种，而其他人则认为Ga+H+配对位点是稳定的活性物种。最新研究进一步复杂化了这一图景，表明在Ga/H-MFI沸石中与Al配对的Ga交换物种对丙烷和丁烷脱氢都有效，而孤立的Ga物种则无效。

这种对Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂理解的演变突出了PDH催化的复杂性，以及为优化工业丙烯生产的催化剂性能所做的持续努力。
