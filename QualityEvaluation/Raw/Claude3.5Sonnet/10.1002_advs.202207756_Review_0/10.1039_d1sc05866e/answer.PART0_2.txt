The growing demand for propylene, coupled with the low cost of propane from shale gas, has led to renewed interest in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) as a production method. This has driven research into new catalysts for PDH reactions.

Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts have emerged as promising candidates for PDH, showing high stability and propylene selectivity (90%). However, there is ongoing debate about the nature of the active Ga species in these catalysts. Some researchers propose that single [GaH]2+ sites are the active species, while others argue for Ga+H+ pair sites as the stable active centers. 

Recent research has further complicated the picture, suggesting that the active Ga species may depend on the specific reaction. For instance, Ga-exchanged species associated with Al-pairs in Ga/H-MFI have been found to catalyze both propane and butane dehydrogenation, while isolated Ga species did not show this activity.

These evolving understandings highlight the complexity of Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts and underscore the need for continued research to fully elucidate the nature of the active sites and their role in PDH reactions.

丙烯需求的增长，加上页岩气中丙烷成本的降低，已经重新引起了人们对丙烷脱氢(PDH)作为生产方法的兴趣。这推动了对PDH反应新催化剂的研究。

Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂已经成为PDH的有前途的候选者，显示出高稳定性和丙烯选择性(90%)。然而，关于这些催化剂中活性Ga物种的性质仍存在争议。一些研究人员提出单一的[GaH]2+位点是活性物种，而其他人则认为Ga+H+对位点是稳定的活性中心。

最近的研究进一步复杂化了这个问题，表明活性Ga物种可能取决于特定的反应。例如，在Ga/H-MFI中与Al对相关的Ga交换物种被发现可以催化丙烷和丁烷脱氢，而孤立的Ga物种则没有显示这种活性。

这些不断发展的理解突出了Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂的复杂性，并强调了需要继续研究以充分阐明活性位点的性质及其在PDH反应中的作用。
