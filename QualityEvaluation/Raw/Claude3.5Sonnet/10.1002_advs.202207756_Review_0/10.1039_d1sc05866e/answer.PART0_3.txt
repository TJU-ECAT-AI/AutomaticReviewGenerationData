The growing demand for propylene, coupled with the low cost of propane from shale gas, has led to renewed interest in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) as a production method. This has spurred research into various catalysts, including those based on Ga, Zn, Co, Fe, V, and Zr, as well as nanocarbon catalysts.

Among these, Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts have shown particularly promising results for PDH, exhibiting high stability and propylene selectivity of up to 90%. However, the understanding of these catalysts has evolved over time, with ongoing debates about the nature of the active Ga species.

Initially, some researchers believed that single [GaH]2+ sites were the active species in Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts. However, other studies have proposed that Ga+H+ pair sites are the stable active species. More recent research has suggested that the active sites may be more complex, with Ga-exchanged species associated with Al-pairs in the zeolite framework being responsible for catalyzing both propane and butane dehydrogenation, while isolated Ga species were found to be inactive for these reactions.

These conflicting findings highlight the complexity of the Ga/H-ZSM-5 system and the ongoing nature of research in this area. The evolution of our understanding of these catalysts demonstrates the importance of continued investigation to optimize PDH processes and meet the growing demand for propylene.

丙烯需求的增长，加上页岩气产生的丙烷成本低廉，使得丙烷脱氢(PDH)作为一种生产方法重新引起了人们的兴趣。这推动了对各种催化剂的研究，包括基于Ga、Zn、Co、Fe、V和Zr的催化剂，以及纳米碳催化剂。

在这些催化剂中，Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂在PDH方面显示出特别有前景的结果，表现出高稳定性和高达90%的丙烯选择性。然而，对这些催化剂的理解随时间而演变，关于活性Ga物种的本质仍存在持续的争论。

最初，一些研究人员认为单一的[GaH]2+位点是Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂中的活性物种。然而，其他研究提出Ga+H+配对位点是稳定的活性物种。更近期的研究表明，活性位点可能更为复杂，与沸石框架中Al配对相关的Ga交换物种负责催化丙烷和丁烷脱氢，而孤立的Ga物种对这些反应则不活跃。

这些相互矛盾的发现突显了Ga/H-ZSM-5系统的复杂性和该领域研究的持续性质。我们对这些催化剂理解的演变表明，继续研究以优化PDH过程并满足不断增长的丙烯需求的重要性。
