[1] "Propene, used in the chemical industry for the manufacture of polymers, solvents, dyes, resins, fibers, and drugs is mainly produced from crude oil. In view of finite petroleum reserves but growing demand for this olefin, vast reserves of shale gas consisting predominantly of methane and of lower amounts of ethane and propane1 could provide an economical alternative to crude oil."

[2] "One way to convert propane to propene is the non-oxidative propane dehydrogenation (PDH), which is a successful example of raw-material change in the chemical industry."

[3] "Propene production via PDH in 2012 amounted to about 5million metric tons (mmt) from the total 80mmt production. The share is expected to grow because several PDH plants are under construction."

The growing demand for propylene has influenced the development of new production methods, particularly propane dehydrogenation (PDH), in several ways:

1. PDH has emerged as an alternative to traditional crude oil-based production methods due to finite petroleum reserves and increasing propylene demand.

2. PDH represents a successful shift in raw materials for the chemical industry, utilizing propane from shale gas reserves instead of relying solely on crude oil.

3. The share of propylene production via PDH is expected to grow, with new PDH plants under construction to meet the rising demand.

However, the provided literature does not contain specific information about the evolution of understanding Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts for PDH, the debate about active Ga species, or recent research findings related to these catalysts. The text focuses more on ZrO2-based catalysts and does not discuss Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts in detail.

丙烯需求的增长影响了新生产方法的发展，特别是丙烷脱氢（PDH），主要体现在以下几个方面：

1. 由于石油储量有限和丙烯需求增加，PDH已成为传统原油基生产方法的替代选择。

2. PDH代表了化工行业原料使用的成功转变，利用页岩气储量中的丙烷，而不是完全依赖原油。

3. 预计通过PDH生产丙烯的份额将会增长，新的PDH工厂正在建设中，以满足不断增长的需求。

然而，提供的文献中并没有包含关于Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂在PDH中理解演变的具体信息，也没有涉及活性Ga物种的争论或与这些催化剂相关的最新研究发现。文本更多地关注基于ZrO2的催化剂，并未详细讨论Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂。
