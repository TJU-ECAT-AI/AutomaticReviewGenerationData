[1] "Propene, used in the chemical industry for the manufacture of polymers, solvents, dyes, resins, fibers, and drugs is mainly produced from crude oil. In view of finite petroleum reserves but growing demand for this olefin, vast reserves of shale gas consisting predominantly of methane and of lower amounts of ethane and propane1 could provide an economical alternative to crude oil."

[2] "One way to convert propane to propene is the non-oxidative propane dehydrogenation (PDH), which is a successful example of raw-material change in the chemical industry."

[3] "Propene production via PDH in 2012 amounted to about 5million metric tons (mmt) from the total 80mmt production. The share is expected to grow because several PDH plants are under construction."

The growing demand for propylene has influenced the development of new production methods, particularly propane dehydrogenation (PDH). This shift is driven by finite petroleum reserves and the availability of vast shale gas reserves containing propane. PDH has emerged as a successful example of raw material change in the chemical industry, converting propane to propene. In 2012, PDH accounted for about 5 million metric tons of propene production out of a total 80 million metric tons. The share of PDH in propene production is expected to increase as several new PDH plants are under construction.

The document does not provide specific information about the evolution of understanding Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts for PDH, the ongoing debate about active Ga species, or recent research findings contributing to the current knowledge of these catalysts. The focus of the literature is primarily on ZrO2-based catalysts and their active sites for propane dehydrogenation.

丙烯需求的增长推动了新生产方法的发展，特别是丙烷脱氢(PDH)。这种转变是由于石油储备有限和大量页岩气储备中含有丙烷。PDH已成为化工行业原材料变革的成功案例，将丙烷转化为丙烯。2012年，在总计8000万公吨的丙烯产量中，PDH贡献了约500万公吨。随着多个新PDH工厂的建设，PDH在丙烯生产中的份额预计将会增加。

该文献并未提供关于Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂在PDH中的理解演变、活性Ga物种的持续争论，或近期研究发现对这些催化剂当前认知贡献的具体信息。文献主要关注ZrO2基催化剂及其在丙烷脱氢中的活性位点。
