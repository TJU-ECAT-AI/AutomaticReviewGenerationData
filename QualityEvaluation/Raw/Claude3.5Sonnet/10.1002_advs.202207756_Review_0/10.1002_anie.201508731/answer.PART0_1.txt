[1] "Propene, used in the chemical industry for the manufacture of polymers, solvents, dyes, resins, fibers, and drugs is mainly produced from crude oil. In view of finite petroleum reserves but growing demand for this olefin, vast reserves of shale gas consisting predominantly of methane and of lower amounts of ethane and propane1 could provide an economical alternative to crude oil."

[2] "One way to convert propane to propene is the non-oxidative propane dehydrogenation (PDH), which is a successful example of raw-material change in the chemical industry."

[3] "Propene production via PDH in 2012 amounted to about 5million metric tons (mmt) from the total 80mmt production. The share is expected to grow because several PDH plants are under construction."

The growing demand for propylene has influenced the development of new production methods, particularly propane dehydrogenation (PDH), in response to finite petroleum reserves. PDH has emerged as a successful alternative to crude oil-based production, utilizing vast reserves of shale gas containing propane. In 2012, PDH accounted for about 5 million metric tons of propene production out of a total 80 million metric tons. This share is expected to increase as new PDH plants are being constructed.

The literature does not provide specific information about the evolution of understanding Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts for PDH, the debate about active Ga species, or recent research findings related to these catalysts. The document focuses on ZrO2-based catalysts and does not mention Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts in the context of PDH.

随着石油储量有限但丙烯需求不断增长，新的生产方法尤其是丙烷脱氢(PDH)得到了发展。PDH作为一种成功的替代原油生产的方法，利用了含有丙烷的页岩气储量。2012年，PDH在总计8000万公吨的丙烯产量中贡献了约500万公吨。随着新的PDH工厂正在建设，这一份额预计将会增加。

文献中没有提供关于Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂在PDH中的理解演变、活性Ga物种的争论或与这些催化剂相关的最新研究发现的具体信息。该文档主要关注基于ZrO2的催化剂，并未在PDH背景下提及Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂。
