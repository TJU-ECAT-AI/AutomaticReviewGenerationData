[1] "Propene, used in the chemical industry for the manufacture of polymers, solvents, dyes, resins, fibers, and drugs is mainly produced from crude oil. In view of finite petroleum reserves but growing demand for this olefin, vast reserves of shale gas consisting predominantly of methane and of lower amounts of ethane and propane1 could provide an economical alternative to crude oil."

[2] "One way to convert propane to propene is the non-oxidative propane dehydrogenation (PDH), which is a successful example of raw-material change in the chemical industry."

[3] "Propene production via PDH in 2012 amounted to about 5million metric tons (mmt) from the total 80mmt production. The share is expected to grow because several PDH plants are under construction."

The growing demand for propylene has led to the development of new production methods, particularly propane dehydrogenation (PDH). This shift is driven by finite petroleum reserves and the availability of shale gas as an economical alternative. PDH has become a successful example of raw material change in the chemical industry. In 2012, PDH accounted for about 5 million metric tons of propene production out of a total 80 million metric tons. The share of PDH in propene production is expected to increase due to the construction of new PDH plants.

The literature does not provide information about the evolution of understanding Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts for PDH, the debate about active Ga species, or recent research findings related to these catalysts. The document focuses on ZrO2-based catalysts rather than Ga-containing catalysts.

丙烯需求的增长推动了新生产方法的发展，特别是丙烷脱氢(PDH)。这一转变是由于石油储量有限以及页岩气作为经济替代品的可用性所驱动的。PDH已成为化学工业原料变革的成功范例。2012年，在总计8000万公吨的丙烯产量中，PDH占约500万公吨。由于新PDH工厂的建设，PDH在丙烯生产中的份额预计将会增加。

文献中没有提供关于对Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂在PDH中的理解演变、活性Ga物种的争论，或与这些催化剂相关的最新研究发现的信息。该文档主要关注基于ZrO2的催化剂，而不是含Ga的催化剂。

The growing demand for propylene has influenced the development of new production methods, particularly propane dehydrogenation (PDH), in response to finite petroleum reserves. PDH has emerged as a successful alternative to crude oil-based production, utilizing vast reserves of shale gas containing propane. In 2012, PDH accounted for about 5 million metric tons of propene production out of a total 80 million metric tons. This share is expected to increase as new PDH plants are being constructed.

The literature does not provide specific information about the evolution of understanding Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts for PDH, the debate about active Ga species, or recent research findings related to these catalysts. The document focuses on ZrO2-based catalysts and does not mention Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts in the context of PDH.

随着石油储量有限但丙烯需求不断增长，新的生产方法尤其是丙烷脱氢(PDH)得到了发展。PDH作为一种成功的替代原油生产的方法，利用了含有丙烷的页岩气储量。2012年，PDH在总计8000万公吨的丙烯产量中贡献了约500万公吨。随着新的PDH工厂正在建设，这一份额预计将会增加。

文献中没有提供关于Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂在PDH中的理解演变、活性Ga物种的争论或与这些催化剂相关的最新研究发现的具体信息。该文档主要关注基于ZrO2的催化剂，并未在PDH背景下提及Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂。

The growing demand for propylene has influenced the development of new production methods, particularly propane dehydrogenation (PDH), in several ways:

1. PDH has emerged as an alternative to traditional crude oil-based production methods due to finite petroleum reserves and increasing propylene demand.

2. PDH represents a successful shift in raw materials for the chemical industry, utilizing propane from shale gas reserves instead of relying solely on crude oil.

3. The share of propylene production via PDH is expected to grow, with new PDH plants under construction to meet the rising demand.

However, the provided literature does not contain specific information about the evolution of understanding Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts for PDH, the debate about active Ga species, or recent research findings related to these catalysts. The text focuses more on ZrO2-based catalysts and does not discuss Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts in detail.

丙烯需求的增长影响了新生产方法的发展，特别是丙烷脱氢（PDH），主要体现在以下几个方面：

1. 由于石油储量有限和丙烯需求增加，PDH已成为传统原油基生产方法的替代选择。

2. PDH代表了化工行业原料使用的成功转变，利用页岩气储量中的丙烷，而不是完全依赖原油。

3. 预计通过PDH生产丙烯的份额将会增长，新的PDH工厂正在建设中，以满足不断增长的需求。

然而，提供的文献中并没有包含关于Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂在PDH中理解演变的具体信息，也没有涉及活性Ga物种的争论或与这些催化剂相关的最新研究发现。文本更多地关注基于ZrO2的催化剂，并未详细讨论Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂。

The growing demand for propylene has led to the development of new production methods, particularly propane dehydrogenation (PDH). This shift is driven by the finite nature of petroleum reserves and the availability of shale gas as an alternative feedstock. PDH has emerged as a successful example of raw material change in the chemical industry, converting propane from shale gas into propene.

The importance of PDH in propylene production has increased significantly. In 2012, PDH accounted for about 5 million metric tons out of the total 80 million metric tons of propene production. This share is expected to grow further with several new PDH plants under construction.

However, the literature provided does not contain information about the development of Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts for PDH, the debate about active Ga species, or recent research findings related to these catalysts. The document focuses on ZrO2-based catalysts and does not mention Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts.
