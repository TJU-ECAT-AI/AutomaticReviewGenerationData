[1] "Propene, used in the chemical industry for the manufacture of polymers, solvents, dyes, resins, fibers, and drugs is mainly produced from crude oil. In view of finite petroleum reserves but growing demand for this olefin, vast reserves of shale gas consisting predominantly of methane and of lower amounts of ethane and propane1 could provide an economical alternative to crude oil."

[2] "One way to convert propane to propene is the non-oxidative propane dehydrogenation (PDH), which is a successful example of raw-material change in the chemical industry."

[3] "Propene production via PDH in 2012 amounted to about 5million metric tons (mmt) from the total 80mmt production. The share is expected to grow because several PDH plants are under construction."

The growing demand for propylene has led to the development of new production methods, particularly propane dehydrogenation (PDH). This shift is driven by the finite nature of petroleum reserves and the availability of shale gas as an alternative feedstock. PDH has emerged as a successful example of raw material change in the chemical industry, converting propane from shale gas into propene.

The importance of PDH in propylene production has increased significantly. In 2012, PDH accounted for about 5 million metric tons out of the total 80 million metric tons of propene production. This share is expected to grow further with several new PDH plants under construction.

However, the literature provided does not contain information about the development of Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts for PDH, the debate about active Ga species, or recent research findings related to these catalysts. The document focuses on ZrO2-based catalysts and does not mention Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts.

丙烯需求的增长推动了新生产方法的发展，特别是丙烷脱氢（PDH）。这种转变是由石油储备有限和页岩气作为替代原料的可用性驱动的。PDH已成为化学工业原料变革的成功范例，将页岩气中的丙烷转化为丙烯。

PDH在丙烯生产中的重要性显著增加。2012年，PDH占总计8000万公吨丙烯产量中的约500万公吨。随着几个新的PDH工厂正在建设中，这一份额预计将进一步增长。

然而，提供的文献中没有关于Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂用于PDH的发展、活性Ga物种的争论或与这些催化剂相关的最新研究发现的信息。该文档主要关注基于ZrO2的催化剂，并未提及Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂。
