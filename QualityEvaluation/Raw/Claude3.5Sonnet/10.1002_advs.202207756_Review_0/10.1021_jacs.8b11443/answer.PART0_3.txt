The given literature does not contain information to answer the question about the growing demand for propylene, development of propane dehydrogenation (PDH) methods, or the evolution of understanding Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts for PDH. The document appears to be a title and author list for a scientific article about propane dehydrogenation and cracking over Ga/H-MFI catalysts, but does not provide any content to address the specific points in the question. Without additional text from the full article, it is not possible to provide an informed answer to this question based solely on the given information.

所给文献不包含有关丙烯需求增长、丙烷脱氢(PDH)方法开发或Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂用于PDH的理解演变的信息。该文档似乎是一篇关于Ga/H-MFI催化剂上丙烷脱氢和裂解的科学文章的标题和作者列表,但没有提供任何内容来解决问题中的具体要点。没有全文的额外文本,仅凭所给信息无法对这个问题提供有依据的回答。
