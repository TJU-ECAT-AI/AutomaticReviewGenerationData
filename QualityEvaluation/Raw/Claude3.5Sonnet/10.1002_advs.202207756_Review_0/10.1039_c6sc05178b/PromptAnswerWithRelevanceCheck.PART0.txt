[1] "The increasing propylene demand combined with the use of alternative feedstocks such as shale gas has amplified the pressure towards propene production and the development of light alkane dehydrogenation processes."

[2] "As a result, on-site propane dehydrogenation (PDH) is of particular interest for current and future propylene production."

[3] "Gallium-based zeolites have already been implemented for the conversion of lightweight alkanes to aromatics and H2, a process proposed to involve a tandem dehydrogenation  aromatization process."

[4] "Ga2O3 and related materials have also been investigated as catalysts for alkane conversion, specifically PDH due to the high selectivity for propylene."

[5] "Several computational and experimental studies have aimed at identifying these active sites, which so far remains a topic of debate."

The growing demand for propylene, coupled with the use of alternative feedstocks like shale gas, has increased pressure to develop new propylene production methods, particularly propane dehydrogenation (PDH). This has led to increased interest in on-site PDH for current and future propylene production.

The understanding of Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts for PDH has evolved over time. Gallium-based zeolites have been implemented for converting lightweight alkanes to aromatics and H2, involving a proposed tandem dehydrogenation-aromatization process. Additionally, Ga2O3 and related materials have been investigated as catalysts for alkane conversion, specifically PDH, due to their high selectivity for propylene.

However, the nature of the active Ga species in these catalysts remains a topic of debate. Despite numerous computational and experimental studies aimed at identifying these active sites, a clear consensus has not yet been reached. This ongoing debate highlights the complexity of the catalytic system and the need for further research to fully understand the active Ga species in PDH catalysts.

随着丙烯需求的增长以及页岩气等替代原料的使用，开发新的丙烯生产方法，特别是丙烷脱氢(PDH)的压力增大。这导致了对当前和未来丙烯生产的现场PDH兴趣增加。

对PDH用Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂的理解随时间不断发展。镓基沸石已被用于将轻质烷烃转化为芳烃和H2，这个过程被认为涉及串联脱氢-芳构化过程。此外，由于对丙烯具有高选择性，Ga2O3和相关材料也被研究用作烷烃转化催化剂，特别是PDH。

然而，这些催化剂中活性镓物种的本质仍然存在争议。尽管已经进行了许多旨在识别这些活性位点的计算和实验研究，但尚未达成明确共识。这种持续的争论突显了催化体系的复杂性，以及需要进一步研究以充分理解PDH催化剂中活性镓物种的必要性。

The growing demand for propylene, combined with the shift to alternative feedstocks like shale gas, has increased pressure to develop new propylene production methods, particularly propane dehydrogenation (PDH). This has made on-site PDH of significant interest for current and future propylene production.

The understanding of Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts for PDH has evolved over time. Gallium-based zeolites have been implemented for converting light alkanes to aromatics and H2, involving a tandem dehydrogenation-aromatization process. Ga2O3 and related materials have also been investigated as catalysts for PDH due to their high selectivity for propylene.

There is an ongoing debate about the active Ga species in these catalysts. It is proposed that tetra-coordinate surface sites of Ga2O3 are the active sites for propane dehydrogenation. However, the reducibility of Ga2O3 leads to facile reduction of these sites, resulting in catalyst deactivation. This remains a topic of debate, with several computational and experimental studies aiming to identify these active sites. The exact nature of the active sites and the mechanisms involved in PDH over Ga-based catalysts are still not fully understood, highlighting the need for further research in this area.

丙烯需求的增长，加上转向使用页岩气等替代原料，增加了开发新型丙烯生产方法的压力，特别是丙烷脱氢（PDH）。这使得现场PDH对当前和未来的丙烯生产变得极为重要。

关于这些催化剂中活性镓物种的争论仍在继续。有人提出Ga2O3的四配位表面位点是丙烷脱氢的活性位点。然而，Ga2O3的可还原性导致这些位点容易被还原，从而使催化剂失活。这仍然是一个争论的话题，多项计算和实验研究旨在识别这些活性位点。Ga基催化剂上PDH的确切活性位点性质和机理仍未完全了解，突显了该领域进一步研究的必要性。
