The growing demand for propylene, combined with the shift to alternative feedstocks like shale gas, has increased pressure to develop new propylene production methods, particularly propane dehydrogenation (PDH). This has made on-site PDH of significant interest for current and future propylene production.

The understanding of Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts for PDH has evolved over time. Gallium-based zeolites have been implemented for converting light alkanes to aromatics and H2, involving a tandem dehydrogenation-aromatization process. Ga2O3 and related materials have also been investigated as catalysts for PDH due to their high selectivity for propylene.

There is an ongoing debate about the active Ga species in these catalysts. It is proposed that tetra-coordinate surface sites of Ga2O3 are the active sites for propane dehydrogenation. However, the reducibility of Ga2O3 leads to facile reduction of these sites, resulting in catalyst deactivation. This remains a topic of debate, with several computational and experimental studies aiming to identify these active sites. The exact nature of the active sites and the mechanisms involved in PDH over Ga-based catalysts are still not fully understood, highlighting the need for further research in this area.

丙烯需求的增长，加上转向使用页岩气等替代原料，增加了开发新型丙烯生产方法的压力，特别是丙烷脱氢（PDH）。这使得现场PDH对当前和未来的丙烯生产变得极为重要。

对Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂用于PDH的理解随时间而演变。镓基沸石已被用于将轻烷烃转化为芳烃和H2，涉及串联脱氢-芳构化过程。Ga2O3和相关材料也因其对丙烯的高选择性而被研究用作PDH催化剂。

关于这些催化剂中活性镓物种的争论仍在继续。有人提出Ga2O3的四配位表面位点是丙烷脱氢的活性位点。然而，Ga2O3的可还原性导致这些位点容易被还原，从而使催化剂失活。这仍然是一个争论的话题，多项计算和实验研究旨在识别这些活性位点。Ga基催化剂上PDH的确切活性位点性质和机理仍未完全了解，突显了该领域进一步研究的必要性。
