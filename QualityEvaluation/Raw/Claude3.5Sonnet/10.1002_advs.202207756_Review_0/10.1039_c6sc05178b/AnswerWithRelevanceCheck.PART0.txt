          [1] "The increasing propylene demand combined with the use of alternative feedstocks such as shale gas has amplified the pressure towards propene production and the development of light alkane dehydrogenation processes."

          [2] "As a result, on-site propane dehydrogenation (PDH) is of particular interest for current and future propylene production."

          [3] "Gallium-based zeolites have already been implemented for the conversion of lightweight alkanes to aromatics and H2, a process proposed to involve a tandem dehydrogenation  aromatization process."

          [4] "Ga2O3 and related materials have also been investigated as catalysts for alkane conversion, specifically PDH due to the high selectivity for propylene."

          [5] "In this regard it is proposed that tetra-coordinate surface sites of Ga2O3 are the active sites for propane dehydrogenation. However, due to the reducibility of Ga2O3, these active sites typically suffer from facile reduction, ultimately resulting in catalyst deactivation."

          [6] "Several computational and experimental studies have aimed at identifying these active sites, which so far remains a topic of debate."

          The growing demand for propylene, coupled with the use of alternative feedstocks like shale gas, has intensified efforts to develop new production methods, particularly propane dehydrogenation (PDH). This has led to increased interest in on-site PDH for current and future propylene production.

          The understanding of Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts for PDH has evolved over time. Initially, gallium-based zeolites were implemented for converting light alkanes to aromatics and H2, involving a tandem dehydrogenation and aromatization process. Later, Ga2O3 and related materials were investigated as catalysts for alkane conversion, specifically PDH, due to their high selectivity for propylene.

          There is an ongoing debate about the active Ga species in these catalysts. It is proposed that tetra-coordinate surface sites of Ga2O3 are the active sites for propane dehydrogenation. However, the reducibility of Ga2O3 leads to facile reduction of these active sites, resulting in catalyst deactivation. This remains a topic of debate, with several computational and experimental studies aiming to identify these active sites. The precise nature of the active Ga species is still not fully understood, highlighting the need for further research in this area.

          随着丙烯需求的增长以及页岩气等替代原料的使用，开发新的丙烯生产方法，特别是丙烷脱氢(PDH)的压力增大。这导致了对当前和未来丙烯生产的现场PDH兴趣增加。

          对PDH用Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂的理解随时间不断发展。最初，镓基沸石被用于将轻烷烃转化为芳烃和H2，涉及串联脱氢和芳构化过程。后来，由于对丙烯的高选择性，Ga2O3和相关材料被研究用作烷烃转化的催化剂，特别是PDH。

          关于这些催化剂中活性镓物种的争论仍在继续。有人提出Ga2O3的四配位表面位点是丙烷脱氢的活性位点。然而，由于Ga2O3的可还原性，这些活性位点容易被还原，导致催化剂失活。这仍然是一个有争议的话题，多项计算和实验研究都在致力于识别这些活性位点。活性镓物种的确切性质仍未完全理解，突显了该领域需要进一步研究。
