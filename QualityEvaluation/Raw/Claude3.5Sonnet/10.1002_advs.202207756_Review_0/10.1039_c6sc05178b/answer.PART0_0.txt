The growing demand for propylene, coupled with the use of alternative feedstocks like shale gas, has increased pressure to develop new propylene production methods, particularly propane dehydrogenation (PDH). This has led to increased interest in on-site PDH for current and future propylene production.

The understanding of Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts for PDH has evolved over time. Gallium-based zeolites have been implemented for converting lightweight alkanes to aromatics and H2, involving a proposed tandem dehydrogenation-aromatization process. Additionally, Ga2O3 and related materials have been investigated as catalysts for alkane conversion, specifically PDH, due to their high selectivity for propylene.

However, the nature of the active Ga species in these catalysts remains a topic of debate. Despite numerous computational and experimental studies aimed at identifying these active sites, a clear consensus has not yet been reached. This ongoing debate highlights the complexity of the catalytic system and the need for further research to fully understand the active Ga species in PDH catalysts.

随着丙烯需求的增长以及页岩气等替代原料的使用，开发新的丙烯生产方法，特别是丙烷脱氢(PDH)的压力增大。这导致了对当前和未来丙烯生产的现场PDH兴趣增加。

对PDH用Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂的理解随时间不断发展。镓基沸石已被用于将轻质烷烃转化为芳烃和H2，这个过程被认为涉及串联脱氢-芳构化过程。此外，由于对丙烯具有高选择性，Ga2O3和相关材料也被研究用作烷烃转化催化剂，特别是PDH。

然而，这些催化剂中活性镓物种的本质仍然存在争议。尽管已经进行了许多旨在识别这些活性位点的计算和实验研究，但尚未达成明确共识。这种持续的争论突显了催化体系的复杂性，以及需要进一步研究以充分理解PDH催化剂中活性镓物种的必要性。
