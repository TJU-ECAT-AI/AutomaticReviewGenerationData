The growing demand for propylene, coupled with the use of alternative feedstocks like shale gas, has increased pressure to develop new propylene production methods, particularly propane dehydrogenation (PDH). This has made on-site PDH of significant interest for current and future propylene production.

The understanding of Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts for PDH has evolved over time. Gallium-based zeolites have been implemented for converting light alkanes to aromatics and H2, involving a tandem dehydrogenation-aromatization process. Ga2O3 and related materials have also been investigated as catalysts for alkane conversion, specifically PDH, due to their high selectivity for propylene.

There is an ongoing debate about the active Ga species in these catalysts. It is proposed that tetra-coordinate surface sites of Ga2O3 are the active sites for propane dehydrogenation. However, the reducibility of Ga2O3 leads to facile reduction of these active sites, resulting in catalyst deactivation. This remains a topic of debate, with several computational and experimental studies aiming to identify these active sites. The precise nature of the active Ga species is still not fully understood, highlighting the need for further research in this area.

丙烯需求的增长，加上页岩气等替代原料的使用，增加了对丙烯生产和轻烃脱氢工艺开发的压力。这使得现场丙烷脱氢(PDH)对当前和未来的丙烯生产变得尤为重要。

对Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂在PDH中的理解随时间而演变。镓基沸石已被用于将轻烃转化为芳烃和H2，涉及串联脱氢-芳构化过程。Ga2O3及相关材料也因其对丙烯的高选择性而被研究用作烷烃转化催化剂，特别是PDH。

关于这些催化剂中活性镓物种的争论仍在继续。有人提出Ga2O3的四配位表面位点是丙烷脱氢的活性位点。然而，由于Ga2O3的可还原性，这些活性位点容易被还原，导致催化剂失活。这仍然是一个有争议的话题，多项计算和实验研究都在致力于识别这些活性位点。活性镓物种的确切性质仍未完全理解，突显了该领域需要进一步研究。
