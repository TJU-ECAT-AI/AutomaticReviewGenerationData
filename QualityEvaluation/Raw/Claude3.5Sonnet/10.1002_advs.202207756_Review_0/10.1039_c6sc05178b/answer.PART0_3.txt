The growing demand for propylene, coupled with the use of alternative feedstocks like shale gas, has intensified efforts to develop new production methods, particularly propane dehydrogenation (PDH). This has led to increased interest in on-site PDH for current and future propylene production.

The understanding of Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts for PDH has evolved over time. Initially, gallium-based zeolites were implemented for converting light alkanes to aromatics and H2, involving a tandem dehydrogenation and aromatization process. Later, Ga2O3 and related materials were investigated as catalysts for alkane conversion, specifically PDH, due to their high selectivity for propylene.

However, the debate about active Ga species in these catalysts is ongoing. Despite numerous computational and experimental studies aimed at identifying the active sites, their exact nature remains a topic of discussion. This indicates that our understanding of Ga-based catalysts for PDH is still developing, with recent research continuing to contribute to our knowledge of these catalysts.

随着丙烯需求的增长，以及页岩气等替代原料的使用，开发新的生产方法（特别是丙烷脱氢（PDH））的压力增大。这导致了对当前和未来丙烯生产的现场PDH兴趣增加。

对PDH用Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂的理解随时间而演变。最初，镓基沸石被用于将轻烷烃转化为芳烃和H2，涉及串联脱氢和芳构化过程。后来，由于对丙烯的高选择性，Ga2O3和相关材料被研究用作烷烃转化的催化剂，特别是PDH。

然而，关于这些催化剂中活性镓物种的争论仍在继续。尽管进行了大量的计算和实验研究来识别活性位点，但它们的确切性质仍然是讨论的话题。这表明我们对PDH用镓基催化剂的理解仍在发展中，最近的研究继续为我们对这些催化剂的认知做出贡献。
