The growing demand for propylene, coupled with the shift to alternative feedstocks like shale gas, has intensified efforts to develop new production methods, particularly propane dehydrogenation (PDH). This has led to increased interest in on-site PDH for current and future propylene production.

The understanding of Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts for PDH has evolved over time. Gallium-based zeolites have been implemented for converting light alkanes to aromatics and H2, involving a proposed tandem dehydrogenation-aromatization process. Additionally, Ga2O3 and related materials have been investigated as catalysts for alkane conversion, specifically PDH, due to their high selectivity for propylene.

However, the nature of the active Ga species in these catalysts remains a topic of ongoing debate. Numerous computational and experimental studies have aimed to identify these active sites, but a consensus has not yet been reached. This ongoing research continues to contribute to our current knowledge of Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts for PDH, though many questions remain unanswered.

丙烯需求的增长，加上转向使用页岩气等替代原料，已经加强了开发新生产方法的努力，特别是丙烷脱氢(PDH)。这导致了对当前和未来丙烯生产的现场PDH兴趣增加。

对于PDH的Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂的理解随着时间的推移而发展。含镓沸石已被用于将轻烷烃转化为芳烃和H2，涉及一个提议的串联脱氢-芳构化过程。此外，由于对丙烯的高选择性，Ga2O3和相关材料也被研究用作烷烃转化的催化剂，特别是PDH。

然而，这些催化剂中活性Ga物种的本质仍然是一个持续争论的话题。许多计算和实验研究旨在识别这些活性位点，但尚未达成共识。这项正在进行的研究继续为我们对PDH的Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂的当前知识做出贡献，尽管许多问题仍未得到解答。
