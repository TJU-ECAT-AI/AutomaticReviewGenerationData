Silica-Supported Isolated Gallium Sites as Highly Active, Selective 
and Stable Propane Dehydrogenation Catalysts   
Keith Searles,a Georges Siddiqi,a Olga V. Safonova,b Christophe Copret*a  
Single-site gallium centers on the surface of silica are prepared via grafting of [Ga(OSi(OtBu)3)3(THF)] on SiO2-700 followed 
by a thermolysis step. The resulting surface species corresponds to well-defined tetra-coordinate gallium single-sites, 
[(SiO)3Ga(XOSi)] (X= H or Si) according to IR, X-ray absorption near-edge structure and extended X-ray absorption fine 
structure analysis. These gallium sites show high activity, selectivity and stability for propane dehydrogenation with an 
initial turnover frequency of 20.4 h-1 per gallium center, propylene selectivity of 93% and remarkable stability over 20 h. 
The stability of the catalyst probably results from site-isolation of the active site on a non-reducible support such as silica, 
diminishing facile reduction typical of Ga2O3 catalysts. 
Introduction 
The increasing propylene demand combined with the use 
of alternative feedstocks such as shale gas has amplified the 
pressure towards propene production and the development of 
light alkane dehydrogenation processes.1 In particular, the 
recent conversion of cracking plants from naphtha to ethane, 
the second largest component of shale gas, has resulted in a 
decline in annual propylene production while demand 
continues to 
increase. As 
a 
result, on-site propane 
dehydrogenation (PDH) is of particular interest for current and 
future propylene production.1a, 1c, 2 While the two principal 
industrial processes for PDH utilize CrAl2O3 (CATOFIN) and 
PtSnAl2O3 (Oleflex) supported catalysts,1c, 2 other materials 
such as gallium-based catalysts are receiving considerable 
attention as alternative catalysts.  
Gallium-based zeolites have already been implemented for 
the conversion of lightweight alkanes to aromatics and H2, a 
process proposed to involve a tandem dehydrogenation  
aromatization process.3 Ga2O3 and related materials have also 
been investigated as catalysts for alkane conversion, 
specifically PDH due to the high selectivity for propylene.4 In 
this regard it is proposed that tetra-coordinate surface sites of 
Ga2O3 are the active sites for propane dehydrogenation. 
However, due to the reducibility of Ga2O3, these active sites 
typically suffer from facile reduction, ultimately resulting in 
catalyst deactivation.1c, 5 This is supported by advantageous 
effects of co-feeding CO2 or H2O during PDH, which have been 
attributed to the re-oxidation of inactive Ga(I) sites and 
removal of coke from the surface.5a, 6 Several computational 
and experimental studies have aimed at identifying these 
active sites,4f, 4h, 4i, 7 which so far remains a topic of debate. 
Silica-supported gallium species have been recently prepared 
by electrostatic 
adsorption methods.7a While showing 
promising results, the structure of the active sites is unknown.  
Surface organometallic chemistry (SOMC) allows for the 
generation of well-defined surface species on a variety of 
supports via grafting of tailored molecular precursors on 
supports with isolated OH sites.8 Thus, we reasoned that the 
development of an appropriate molecular precursor would 
allow for generating well-defined isolated active sites of 
gallium outside of bulk Ga2O3. This would result in a material 
with high catalytic activity with respect to total metal loading, 
as inactive bulk Ga2O3 would not be present. Additionally, 
generating isolated gallium sites on a non-reducible support 
such as silica could diminish reduction processes and allow for 
the development of a catalyst with enhanced stability under 
PDH conditions. A two-step approach, involving both SOMC 
and the thermolytic molecular precursor approach has 
previously been implemented to generate isolated surface 
sites with controlled oxidation state and nuclearity.9 Herein we 
describe the synthesis, structural characterization of the 
molecular complex [Ga(OSi(OtBu)3)3(THF)] (1)10 and its 
utilization as a precursor for generating gallium single-sites on 
silica. These isolated gallium sites were achieved through 
grafting of 1 on silica followed by a thermolysis step at 500 C 
under high vacuum. The presented gallium species display 
unprecedented 
catalytic 
performances, 
combining 
high 
activity, selectivity and stability in the dehydrogenation of 
propane.

Results and Discussion 
First, we developed the synthesis of [Ga(OSi(OtBu)3)3(THF)] 
(1) by reacting GaCl3 with Na(OSi(OtBu)3) in THF.10 A high-
quality X-ray diffraction experiment provides reliable bond 
distances and angles for this precursor (Figure 1). Opaque 
single crystals were grown from a saturated pentane solution 
cooled to 40 C. This analysis reveals a distorted trigonal 
pyramidal geometry around the Ga(III) center (τ4 = 0.86).11 The 
THF ligand occupies the axial position (Ga1O1THF, 1.963(2) Å) 
rendering the three siloxide ligands in the equatorial plane 
(Ga1-O2siloxide, 1.780(2) Å). This unusual geometry about the 
gallium metal center is attributed to the steric repulsion of the 
bulky siloxide ligands. 
The next step was the reaction of a benzene solution of 1 
with SiO2-700 (0.31 mmol OH g-1)12 (Figure 1). After 12 hours 
and subsequent washings of the material with benzene, 1H 
NMR spectroscopy revealed complete consumption of 1 and 
formation of isobutene, tert-butanol and THF in ratios of 4.3, 
1.9, and 1.0 equivalents per consumed gallium complex. No 
detectable amount of HOSi(OtBu)3 was released after the 
grafting process, which is in sharp contrast to what was 
observed for similar Cr(III) or Fe(III) analogues.9b, 9h The 
aforementioned ratios indicate release of THF and thermal 
transformation of two OSi(OtBu)3 ligands of 1 when 
contacted with the silica surface over the duration of 12 hours. 
The material was dried under high vacuum (10-5 mbar) for 12 
hours and subsequent analysis by IR spectroscopy revealed 
two νOH bands in the range of 3800-3100 cm-1 that are 
attributed to regenerated surface OH sites and HOR (R = 
Si(OtBu)3 or tBu) remaining on the surface (see ESI).  
Additional νCH bands of an alkoxide ligand are observed in the 
range of 3050-2860 and 1550-1360 cm-1. 13C MAS SSNMR also 
revealed chemical shifts consistent with the presence of a 
remaining alcohol ligand on the surface of the material (see 
ESI). Elemental analysis of the new material indicated a gallium 
loading of 1.53 weight % and 9.12 C atoms per Ga on the 
surface. These findings are consistent with a material 
possessing a remaining alcohol ligand per gallium immobilized 
on the support, specifically [(SiO)3Ga(HOR)], (2, R = Si(OtBu)3 
or tBu). 
The material 2 was then subjected to thermal treatment up 
to 500 C for 10 hours under high vacuum (10-5 mbar). Analysis 
of the volatile components from thermolysis revealed 2.5 
equivalents of isobutene per gallium on the surface gauged by 
1H NMR spectroscopy. Quantification of ca. 3 C4 fragments per 
gallium, the absence of νCH and the regeneration of SiOH in 
the IR of the new material indicates that thermal elimination 
of aliphatics from 2 was achieved yielding [(SiO)3Ga(XOSi)] 
(3, X = H or Si)] along with the regeneration of SiOH groups 
(Figure 1).  
To understand the coordination environment of gallium on 
the silica surface, we performed X-ray absorption spectroscopy 
(XAS) measurements at Ga K-edge on materials 13. The edge 
position in the X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) 
spectra of 2 and 3 was similar (10374.8 and 10374.2 eV, 
repectively) as well as the position of a shoulder at higher 
energies (10380.8 and 10381.2 eV, respectively), which is 
consistent with tetra-coordinate Ga(III) sites on the surface 
(Figure 2).7a, 13

Fits of the extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) 
data for complexes 13 were fitted in R-space (1.0-3.5 Å) after 
a Fourier transform (1 and 3, k = 3.0-12.0 Å-1; 2, k = 3.0-11.0 Å-
1). The data are summarized in Table 1. For the molecular 
complex 1, two GaO scattering paths at distances of 1.79 Å (N 
= 3) and 2.01 Å (N = 1) were used for modeling of the 1st shell; 
a longer scattering path for GaSi of 3.15 Å (N = 3) was also 
employed for modeling of the 2nd shell. An additional multi-
scattering path for GaOSi of 3.25 Å (N = 6) and a long 
scattering path for GaO of 3.50 Å (N = 3) were required to 
produce a good fit. These distances match well with the X-ray 
single-crystal diffraction data obtained for 1. For the grafted 
complex 2 and the thermally treated complex 3, only GaO 
and GaSi scattering paths were used for fitting the 
experimental data. The fit for 2 indicates that Ga has 4.1 
oxygen neighbors at 1.81 Å and 2.0 silicon neighbors at 3.17 Å. 
Similarly, the best fit for 3 is consistent with 3.6 oxygen 
neighbors at 1.80 Å and 1.4 silicon atoms at 3.08 Å.

Given the possibility of generating gallium dimers upon 
grafting on the surface of silica,14 we have also probed the 
contribution of a GaGa scattering path by performing a 
wavelet transform (WT) analysis15 on the EXAFS data for 
thermally treated 3 (Figure 3). This analysis provides a 
correlation of R and k-space and ultimately aids in the 
distinction between two different atoms positioned at similar 
distances from the gallium metal center. The WT analysis of 3 
shows a predominant feature with the maximum intensity in 
the range of R = 1.21.6 Å and k = 4.56.2 Å-1, which is ascribed 
to the GaO scattering path. Scattering paths for GaSi and 
GaOSi produce features in the range of R = 2.62.8 Å and k = 
6.08.0 Å-1 for complex 3; no GaGa path could be identified.
