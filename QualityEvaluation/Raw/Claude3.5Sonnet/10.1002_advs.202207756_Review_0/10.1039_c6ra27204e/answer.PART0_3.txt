[1] "Propylene is a major raw chemical for the petrochemical industry. In recent years, more attention has been paid to the catalytic dehydrogenation of propane to propylene because the growing demand for propylene is beyond the production capacity of conventional hydrocarbon steam cracking and catalytic cracking processes."

[2] "Currently, many studies are devoted to developing novel and potential catalysts in propane dehydrogenation (PDH), such as ceria-based catalysts, calcined hydrotalcite-supported platinum catalysts, Sn/SiO2 catalysts, Pd-based catalysts, mesoporous carbons, gallium oxide-based catalysts and so on."

[3] "Among these, gallium oxide-based catalysts have been recognized as new promising alkane dehydrogenation materials due to their unique capability to activate hydrocarbon species and excellent catalytic efficiency as compared to conventional Cr2O3- and V2O5-based catalysts."

[4] "The previous studies reported that the gallium oxides (Ga2O3, GaO+) were the most species presented on the catalyst after calcination and were readily reduced during pretreatment with hydrogen. The various gallium species (Ga2O3, GaO+ and Ga+) as active constituents exhibited different performances for light alkane dehydrogenation reaction."

The growing demand for propylene has led to increased focus on catalytic dehydrogenation of propane as an alternative production method, as conventional processes like steam cracking and catalytic cracking are unable to meet the demand. This has driven research into developing new catalysts for propane dehydrogenation (PDH).

Among the various catalysts being studied, gallium oxide-based catalysts have emerged as promising materials for PDH due to their ability to activate hydrocarbons and their excellent catalytic efficiency compared to conventional catalysts. Research has shown that different gallium species (Ga2O3, GaO+, and Ga+) can be present on these catalysts and exhibit varying performances in alkane dehydrogenation.

The understanding of Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts for PDH has evolved through ongoing research into the nature and role of active gallium species. While there is still debate about the exact active species, studies have found that gallium oxides are predominant after calcination and can be reduced during hydrogen pretreatment. This research has contributed to our current knowledge of how different gallium species influence catalytic performance in PDH reactions.

由于丙烯需求的增长超过了传统的蒸汽裂解和催化裂解工艺的生产能力，因此人们越来越关注丙烷催化脱氢作为替代生产方法。这推动了对开发新型丙烷脱氢(PDH)催化剂的研究。

在研究的各种催化剂中，氧化镓基催化剂因其活化烃类的能力和与传统催化剂相比优异的催化效率而成为很有前景的材料。研究表明，这些催化剂上可以存在不同的镓物种(Ga2O3、GaO+和Ga+)，并在烷烃脱氢中表现出不同的性能。

对PDH反应中Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂的理解已经通过对活性镓物种的性质和作用的持续研究而不断发展。虽然关于确切的活性物种仍存在争议，但研究发现，氧化镓在焙烧后占主导地位，并可在氢气预处理过程中被还原。这些研究有助于我们当前对不同镓物种如何影响PDH反应中催化性能的认识。
