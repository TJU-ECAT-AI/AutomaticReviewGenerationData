[1] "Propylene is a major raw chemical for the petrochemical industry. In recent years, more attention has been paid to the catalytic dehydrogenation of propane to propylene because the growing demand for propylene is beyond the production capacity of conventional hydrocarbon steam cracking and catalytic cracking processes."

[2] "Currently, many studies are devoted to developing novel and potential catalysts in propane dehydrogenation (PDH), such as ceria-based catalysts, calcined hydrotalcite-supported platinum catalysts, Sn/SiO2 catalysts, Pd-based catalysts, mesoporous carbons, gallium oxide-based catalysts and so on."

[3] "The previous studies reported that the gallium oxides (Ga2O3, GaO+) were the most species presented on the catalyst after calcination and were readily reduced during pretreatment with hydrogen. The various gallium species (Ga2O3, GaO+ and Ga+) as active constituents exhibited different performances for light alkane dehydrogenation reaction."

The growing demand for propylene has led to increased focus on catalytic dehydrogenation of propane as an alternative production method, as conventional processes like steam cracking and catalytic cracking cannot meet the rising demand. This has driven research into developing new catalysts for propane dehydrogenation (PDH), including gallium oxide-based catalysts.

The understanding of Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts for PDH has evolved over time. Initially, researchers identified gallium oxides (Ga2O3, GaO+) as the primary species present after calcination. These species were found to readily reduce during hydrogen pretreatment. Further studies revealed that different gallium species (Ga2O3, GaO+ and Ga+) exhibited varying performances as active constituents in light alkane dehydrogenation reactions.

There has been ongoing debate about the nature of active Ga species in these catalysts. Recent research has contributed to our current knowledge by investigating the reduction behavior, dispersion, and interaction of gallium species with the support. However, the literature provided does not give specific details on the most recent findings or resolution of debates regarding active Ga species in Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts for PDH.

丙烯需求的增长导致了对丙烷催化脱氢作为替代生产方法的关注度增加，因为传统的蒸汽裂解和催化裂解过程无法满足不断增长的需求。这推动了对新型丙烷脱氢（PDH）催化剂的研究，包括氧化镓基催化剂。

对Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂在PDH中的理解随时间而演变。最初，研究人员确定氧化镓（Ga2O3, GaO+）是煅烧后存在的主要物种。这些物种被发现在氢气预处理过程中容易被还原。进一步的研究表明，不同的镓物种（Ga2O3, GaO+和Ga+）作为活性成分在轻烃脱氢反应中表现出不同的性能。

关于这些催化剂中活性Ga物种的本质一直存在争议。最近的研究通过考察镓物种的还原行为、分散性以及与载体的相互作用，为我们目前的认知做出了贡献。然而，所提供的文献并未给出关于Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂在PDH中活性Ga物种的最新发现或争议解决的具体细节。
