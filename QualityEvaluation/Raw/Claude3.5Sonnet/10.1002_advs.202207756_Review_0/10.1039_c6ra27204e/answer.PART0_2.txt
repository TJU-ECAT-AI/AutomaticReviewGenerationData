[1] "Propylene is a major raw chemical for the petrochemical industry. In recent years, more attention has been paid to the catalytic dehydrogenation of propane to propylene because the growing demand for propylene is beyond the production capacity of conventional hydrocarbon steam cracking and catalytic cracking processes."

[2] "Currently, many studies are devoted to developing novel and potential catalysts in propane dehydrogenation (PDH), such as ceria-based catalysts, calcined hydrotalcite-supported platinum catalysts, Sn/SiO2 catalysts, Pd-based catalysts, mesoporous carbons, gallium oxide-based catalysts and so on."

[3] "The previous studies reported that the gallium oxides (Ga2O3, GaO+) were the most species presented on the catalyst after calcination and were readily reduced during pretreatment with hydrogen."

[4] "The various gallium species (Ga2O3, GaO+ and Ga+) as active constituents exhibited different performances for light alkane dehydrogenation reaction."

The growing demand for propylene has led to increased focus on catalytic dehydrogenation of propane as an alternative production method, as conventional processes like steam cracking and catalytic cracking can no longer meet demand. This has spurred research into developing new catalysts for propane dehydrogenation (PDH), including gallium oxide-based catalysts.

The understanding of Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts for PDH has evolved over time. Initially, gallium oxides (Ga2O3, GaO+) were identified as the main species present after calcination. These species could be readily reduced during hydrogen pretreatment. More recent research has found that various gallium species (Ga2O3, GaO+ and Ga+) can act as active constituents, with different performances in light alkane dehydrogenation. There is still ongoing debate and research to fully elucidate the nature and role of active gallium species in these catalysts for PDH reactions.

由于丙烯需求的增长,人们越来越关注丙烷催化脱氢作为替代生产方法,因为传统的蒸汽裂解和催化裂解工艺已无法满足需求。这促使研究人员开发新型丙烷脱氢(PDH)催化剂,包括氧化镓基催化剂。

对Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂在PDH中的理解随时间不断发展。最初,氧化镓(Ga2O3, GaO+)被认为是煅烧后存在的主要物种。这些物种在氢气预处理过程中容易被还原。最近的研究发现,各种镓物种(Ga2O3, GaO+和Ga+)可以作为活性成分,在轻烃脱氢反应中表现不同。关于这些催化剂中活性镓物种的本质和作用,仍然存在持续的争论和研究,以充分阐明其在PDH反应中的作用。
