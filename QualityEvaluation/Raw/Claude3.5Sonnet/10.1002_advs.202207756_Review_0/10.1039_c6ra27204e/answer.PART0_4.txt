[1] "Propylene is a major raw chemical for the petrochemical industry. In recent years, more attention has been paid to the catalytic dehydrogenation of propane to propylene because the growing demand for propylene is beyond the production capacity of conventional hydrocarbon steam cracking and catalytic cracking processes."

[2] "Currently, many studies are devoted to developing novel and potential catalysts in propane dehydrogenation (PDH), such as ceria-based catalysts, calcined hydrotalcite-supported platinum catalysts, Sn/SiO2 catalysts, Pd-based catalysts, mesoporous carbons, gallium oxide-based catalysts and so on."

[3] "Among these, gallium oxide-based catalysts have been recognized as new promising alkane dehydrogenation materials due to their unique capability to activate hydrocarbon species and excellent catalytic efficiency as compared to conventional Cr2O3- and V2O5-based catalysts."

[4] "The previous studies reported that the gallium oxides (Ga2O3, GaO+) were the most species presented on the catalyst after calcination and were readily reduced during pretreatment with hydrogen. The various gallium species (Ga2O3, GaO+ and Ga+) as active constituents exhibited different performances for light alkane dehydrogenation reaction."

The growing demand for propylene has led to increased focus on catalytic dehydrogenation of propane as an alternative production method, as conventional processes like steam cracking and catalytic cracking cannot meet the demand. This has spurred research into developing novel catalysts for propane dehydrogenation (PDH).

Gallium oxide-based catalysts have emerged as promising materials for PDH due to their ability to activate hydrocarbons and superior catalytic efficiency compared to conventional Cr2O3 and V2O5 catalysts. Research has shown that different gallium species (Ga2O3, GaO+, Ga+) exist on these catalysts and exhibit varying performance in alkane dehydrogenation. 

The understanding of Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts for PDH has evolved to recognize the importance of the chemical state and dispersion of gallium species. There is ongoing investigation into which gallium species are most active and how they interact with the support. Recent studies have examined how factors like support acidity, gallium loading, and pretreatment conditions affect the nature and distribution of active gallium sites. However, debate continues regarding the precise nature and role of different gallium species in the catalytic mechanism.

由于传统的蒸汽裂解和催化裂解工艺无法满足需求，丙烯需求的增长导致人们更加关注丙烷催化脱氢作为替代生产方法。这推动了对丙烷脱氢(PDH)新型催化剂的研究开发。

氧化镓基催化剂因其活化烃类的能力和与传统Cr2O3和V2O3催化剂相比更高的催化效率而成为有前景的PDH材料。研究表明，这些催化剂上存在不同的镓物种(Ga2O3、GaO+、Ga+)，在烷烃脱氢中表现各异。

对Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂在PDH中的认识已经发展到认识到镓物种的化学状态和分散度的重要性。目前仍在研究哪些镓物种最活跃以及它们如何与载体相互作用。最近的研究考察了载体酸度、镓负载量和预处理条件等因素如何影响活性镓位点的性质和分布。然而，关于不同镓物种在催化机理中的确切性质和作用仍存在争议。
