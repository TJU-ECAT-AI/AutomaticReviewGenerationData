          [1] "Propylene is a major raw chemical for the petrochemical industry. In recent years, more attention has been paid to the catalytic dehydrogenation of propane to propylene because the growing demand for propylene is beyond the production capacity of conventional hydrocarbon steam cracking and catalytic cracking processes."

[2] "Currently, many studies are devoted to developing novel and potential catalysts in propane dehydrogenation (PDH), such as ceria-based catalysts, calcined hydrotalcite-supported platinum catalysts, Sn/SiO2 catalysts, Pd-based catalysts, mesoporous carbons, gallium oxide-based catalysts and so on."

[3] "Among these, gallium oxide-based catalysts have been recognized as new promising alkane dehydrogenation materials due to their unique capability to activate hydrocarbon species and excellent catalytic efficiency as compared to conventional Cr2O3- and V2O5-based catalysts."

[4] "The previous studies reported that the gallium oxides (Ga2O3, GaO+) were the most species presented on the catalyst after calcination and were readily reduced during pretreatment with hydrogen. The various gallium species (Ga2O3, GaO+ and Ga+) as active constituents exhibited different performances for light alkane dehydrogenation reaction."

[5] "It is remarkable that the Ga3d banding energy of the gallium species in pure β-Ga2O3 is the same as that in 5Ga2O3/SiO2 catalyst, indicating that using ZSM-5, Al2O3 and SBA-15 supports can strengthen the interaction between Ga species and support."

          The growing demand for propylene has led to increased focus on catalytic dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) as an alternative production method, as conventional processes like steam cracking and catalytic cracking cannot meet the demand. This has driven research into developing novel catalysts for PDH, with gallium oxide-based catalysts emerging as promising materials due to their ability to activate hydrocarbons and superior catalytic efficiency compared to conventional Cr2O3 and V2O5 catalysts.

The understanding of Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts for PDH has evolved over time. Initially, gallium oxides (Ga2O3, GaO+) were identified as the main species present after calcination, which could be readily reduced during hydrogen pretreatment. Research has shown that different gallium species (Ga2O3, GaO+, and Ga+) can act as active constituents, exhibiting varying performances in light alkane dehydrogenation.

Recent studies have contributed to our current knowledge by revealing that supports like ZSM-5, Al2O3, and SBA-15 can strengthen the interaction between gallium species and the support, unlike SiO2. This interaction likely influences the catalytic performance and stability of the Ga species.

There is ongoing debate and research to fully elucidate the nature and role of active gallium species in these catalysts for PDH reactions. While progress has been made in understanding the influence of supports and the behavior of gallium species, further research is needed to optimize these catalysts for PDH applications and resolve the ongoing debates about the most active Ga species and their precise roles in the catalytic mechanism.

          由于丙烯需求的增长超过了传统的蒸汽裂解和催化裂解工艺的生产能力，因此人们越来越关注丙烷催化脱氢（PDH）作为一种替代生产方法。这推动了对新型PDH催化剂的研究，其中氧化镓基催化剂因其活化烃类的能力和与传统Cr2O3和V2O5催化剂相比更高的催化效率而成为很有前景的材料。

对Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂在PDH中的理解随时间不断发展。最初，研究人员发现焙烧后主要存在氧化镓（Ga2O3, GaO+），这些物种在氢气预处理过程中可以被还原。研究表明，不同的镓物种（Ga2O3, GaO+和Ga+）可以作为活性成分，在轻烃脱氢中表现出不同的性能。

最新研究表明，与SiO2不同，ZSM-5、Al2O3和SBA-15等载体可以增强镓物种与载体之间的相互作用。这种相互作用可能影响镓物种的催化性能和稳定性。

关于这些催化剂中活性镓物种的本质和作用，仍然存在持续的争论和研究，以充分阐明其在PDH反应中的作用。虽然在理解载体的影响和镓物种的行为方面取得了进展，但仍需进行进一步研究，以优化这些催化剂在PDH应用中的性能，并解决关于最活跃的Ga物种及其在催化机理中的确切作用的持续争论。
