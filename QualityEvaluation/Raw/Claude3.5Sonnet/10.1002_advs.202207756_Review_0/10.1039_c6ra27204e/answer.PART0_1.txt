[1] "Propylene is a major raw chemical for the petrochemical industry. In recent years, more attention has been paid to the catalytic dehydrogenation of propane to propylene because the growing demand for propylene is beyond the production capacity of conventional hydrocarbon steam cracking and catalytic cracking processes."

[2] "Currently, many studies are devoted to developing novel and potential catalysts in propane dehydrogenation (PDH), such as ceria-based catalysts, calcined hydrotalcite-supported platinum catalysts, Sn/SiO2 catalysts, Pd-based catalysts, mesoporous carbons, gallium oxide-based catalysts and so on."

[3] "The previous studies reported that the gallium oxides (Ga2O3, GaO+) were the most species presented on the catalyst after calcination and were readily reduced during pretreatment with hydrogen. The various gallium species (Ga2O3, GaO+ and Ga+) as active constituents exhibited different performances for light alkane dehydrogenation reaction."

[4] "It is remarkable that the Ga3d banding energy of the gallium species in pure β-Ga2O3 is the same as that in 5Ga2O3/SiO2 catalyst, indicating that using ZSM-5, Al2O3 and SBA-15 supports can strengthen the interaction between Ga species and support."

The growing demand for propylene has led to increased focus on catalytic dehydrogenation of propane as a new production method, as conventional processes like steam cracking and catalytic cracking can no longer meet the demand. This has driven research into developing novel catalysts for propane dehydrogenation (PDH), including gallium oxide-based catalysts.

The understanding of Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts for PDH has evolved over time. Initially, researchers identified gallium oxides (Ga2O3, GaO+) as the main species present after calcination, which could be reduced during hydrogen pretreatment. Different gallium species (Ga2O3, GaO+ and Ga+) were found to exhibit varying performance in light alkane dehydrogenation.

Recent research has contributed to our current knowledge by revealing that supports like ZSM-5, Al2O3, and SBA-15 can strengthen the interaction between gallium species and the support, unlike SiO2. This interaction likely influences the catalytic performance and stability of the Ga species.

The ongoing debate about active Ga species continues, as researchers work to elucidate the exact nature and role of different gallium species in the catalytic process. While progress has been made in understanding the influence of supports and the behavior of gallium species, further research is needed to fully optimize these catalysts for PDH applications.

由于丙烯需求的增长超过了传统的蒸汽裂解和催化裂解工艺的生产能力，因此人们越来越关注丙烷催化脱氢作为一种新的生产方法。这推动了对包括氧化镓基催化剂在内的新型丙烷脱氢(PDH)催化剂的研究。

对Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂在PDH中的理解随时间不断发展。最初，研究人员发现焙烧后主要存在氧化镓(Ga2O3, GaO+)，这些物种在氢气预处理过程中可以被还原。不同的镓物种(Ga2O3, GaO+和Ga+)在轻烃脱氢中表现出不同的性能。

最新研究表明，与SiO2不同，ZSM-5、Al2O3和SBA-15等载体可以增强镓物种与载体之间的相互作用。这种相互作用可能影响镓物种的催化性能和稳定性，从而为我们当前的认知做出了贡献。

关于活性镓物种的争论仍在继续，研究人员正在努力阐明不同镓物种在催化过程中的确切性质和作用。虽然在理解载体的影响和镓物种的行为方面取得了进展，但仍需进一步研究以充分优化这些催化剂在PDH应用中的性能。
