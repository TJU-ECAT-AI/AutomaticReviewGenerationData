          [1] "Annual propene production was around 130 megatonnes in 20191 and is predicted to increase to 191 megatonnes by 2030. Significantly, the expected growth in propane demand cannot be met by existing processes, which are based on steam-cracking (SC) and fluid catalytic cracking (FCC). Instead, direct or on-purpose processes are being developed to fill the so-called propene gap. The focus of this critical review is on the dehydrogenation of propane."

[2] "Historically, a bifunctional Ga/H-ZSM-5 material has been applied as a catalyst for the commercial process for propane aromatization, developed jointly by UOP and BP as the Cyclar Process."

[3] "As described above, Ga is another non-noble metallic element known to catalyse the dehydrogenation of propane, usually through oxidic, tetrahedrally coordinated Ga3+ species, which are considered to be active sites for CH activation."

[4] "However, several surface gallium species (e.g., Ga2O3, GaO+ and Gan+) can exist and are considered active constituents exhibiting different performance for the DDH reaction. Furthermore, the types of surface Ga species present are dependent on the identity of the support, Ga loading, as well as the preparation method."

[5] "Numerous studies have shown that Ga2O3 dispersed on TiO2, MgO, Al2O3, ZrO2, H-ZSM-5, ZSM-8 and MWW zeolites display distinctly different catalytic properties for alkane dehydrogenation."

[6] "Generally, it is accepted that lowering the surface acidity can further enhance the catalytic performance of a DDH catalyst. The addition of 3-mercaptopropyl-trimethoxysilane (MPS) reduces Brønsted and increases Lewis acid sites in the preparation Ga/MFI catalysts, which resulted in improved performance."

          The growing demand for propylene has significantly influenced the development of new production methods, particularly propane dehydrogenation (PDH). With propylene production expected to increase from 130 megatonnes in 2019 to 191 megatonnes by 2030, existing processes like steam-cracking and fluid catalytic cracking cannot meet this demand. As a result, direct or on-purpose processes, such as propane dehydrogenation, are being developed to fill the "propene gap."

The understanding of Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts for PDH has evolved over time. Initially, Ga/H-ZSM-5 was used as a bifunctional catalyst for propane aromatization in the commercial Cyclar Process. Research has shown that Ga can catalyze propane dehydrogenation through various species.

There is an ongoing debate about the active Ga species in PDH catalysts. While tetrahedrally coordinated Ga3+ species are considered active sites for C-H activation, other surface gallium species such as Ga2O3, GaO+, and Gan+ are also thought to be active constituents. The presence and performance of these different Ga species depend on factors such as the support material, Ga loading, and preparation method.

Recent research has contributed to our current knowledge by highlighting the complexity of Ga-based catalysts. Studies have shown that Ga2O3 dispersed on various supports (TiO2, MgO, Al2O3, ZrO2, H-ZSM-5, ZSM-8, and MWW zeolites) display distinctly different catalytic properties for alkane dehydrogenation. Additionally, it has been found that lowering surface acidity can enhance catalytic performance. For example, the addition of 3-mercaptopropyl-trimethoxysilane (MPS) to Ga/MFI catalysts reduces Brønsted acid sites and increases Lewis acid sites, resulting in improved performance.

These findings suggest that multiple Ga species can coexist on the catalyst surface, each potentially contributing to the overall catalytic performance in different ways. This understanding has led to efforts in optimizing catalyst preparation methods and support materials to control the distribution and nature of active Ga species, ultimately aiming to improve the efficiency of propane dehydrogenation processes.

          丙烯需求的增长显著影响了新生产方法的开发，特别是丙烷脱氢(PDH)。预计丙烯产量将从2019年的1.3亿吨增加到2030年的1.91亿吨，现有的蒸汽裂解和流化催化裂解工艺无法满足这一需求。因此，直接或专门的工艺（如丙烷脱氢）正在开发中，以填补"丙烯缺口"。

对Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂在PDH中的理解随时间不断演变。最初，Ga/H-ZSM-5被用作商业Cyclar工艺中丙烷芳构化的双功能催化剂。研究表明Ga可以通过多种物种催化丙烷脱氢。

关于PDH催化剂中活性Ga物种的争论仍在继续。虽然四面体配位的Ga3+物种被认为是C-H活化的活性位点，但其他表面镓物种如Ga2O3、GaO+和Gan+也被认为是活性成分。这些不同Ga物种的存在和性能取决于支撑材料、Ga负载量和制备方法等因素。

最近的研究通过强调Ga基催化剂的复杂性，为我们当前的认知做出了贡献。研究表明，分散在各种载体（TiO2、MgO、Al2O3、ZrO2、H-ZSM-5、ZSM-8和MWW沸石）上的Ga2O3在烷烃脱氢反应中表现出明显不同的催化性能。此外，研究发现降低表面酸度可以提高催化性能。例如，向Ga/MFI催化剂中添加3-巯丙基三甲氧基硅烷(MPS)可以减少Brønsted酸位，增加Lewis酸位，从而提高性能。

这些发现表明，多种Ga物种可以共存于催化剂表面，每种物种可能以不同方式对整体催化性能做出贡献。这种理解促使人们努力优化催化剂制备方法和支撑材料，以控制活性Ga物种的分布和性质，最终旨在提高丙烷脱氢过程的效率。
