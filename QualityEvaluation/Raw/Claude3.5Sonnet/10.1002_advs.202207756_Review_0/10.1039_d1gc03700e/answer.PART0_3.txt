[1] "Annual propene production was around 130 megatonnes in 20191 and is predicted to increase to 191 megatonnes by 2030. Significantly, the expected growth in propane demand cannot be met by existing processes, which are based on steam-cracking (SC) and fluid catalytic cracking (FCC). Instead, direct or on-purpose processes are being developed to fill the so-called propene gap. The focus of this critical review is on the dehydrogenation of propane."

[2] "Historically, a bifunctional Ga/H-ZSM-5 material has been applied as a catalyst for the commercial process for propane aromatization, developed jointly by UOP and BP as the Cyclar Process."

[3] "Numerous studies have shown that Ga2O3 dispersed on TiO2, MgO, Al2O3, ZrO2, H-ZSM-5, ZSM-8 and MWW zeolites display distinctly different catalytic properties for alkane dehydrogenation."

[4] "Generally, it is accepted that lowering the surface acidity can further enhance the catalytic performance of a DDH catalyst. The addition of 3-mercaptopropyl-trimethoxysilane (MPS) reduces Brnsted and increases Lewis acid sites in the preparation Ga/MFI catalysts, which resulted in improved performance."

The growing demand for propylene has significantly influenced the development of new production methods, particularly propane dehydrogenation (PDH). The expected increase in propene demand from 130 megatonnes in 2019 to 191 megatonnes by 2030 cannot be met by existing processes like steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking. This has led to the development of direct or on-purpose processes, with a focus on propane dehydrogenation to fill the "propene gap."

The understanding of Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts for PDH has evolved over time. Initially, Ga/H-ZSM-5 was used as a bifunctional catalyst for propane aromatization in the commercial Cyclar Process. Research has shown that Ga2O3 supported on various materials, including H-ZSM-5, displays different catalytic properties for alkane dehydrogenation.

The debate about active Ga species continues, but recent research has contributed to our current knowledge. It has been found that lowering surface acidity can enhance catalytic performance in direct dehydrogenation (DDH). For example, the addition of 3-mercaptopropyl-trimethoxysilane (MPS) to Ga/MFI catalysts reduces Brønsted acid sites and increases Lewis acid sites, resulting in improved performance.

These findings highlight the importance of tailoring the acidic properties of Ga-based catalysts to optimize their performance in propane dehydrogenation reactions. The ongoing research in this area continues to refine our understanding of the active Ga species and their role in catalyzing the PDH reaction.

丙烯需求的增长显著影响了新生产方法的发展，特别是丙烷脱氢(PDH)。预计2019年丙烯产量约为1.3亿吨，到2030年将增加到1.91亿吨。现有的蒸汽裂解和流化催化裂解工艺无法满足这一预期增长。因此，直接或定向工艺正在开发中，以填补所谓的"丙烯缺口"，其中丙烷脱氢是重点研究方向。

对Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂在PDH中的理解随时间不断发展。最初，Ga/H-ZSM-5作为双功能催化剂用于商业Cyclar工艺中的丙烷芳构化。研究表明，负载在不同材料上的Ga2O3，包括H-ZSM-5，在烷烃脱氢反应中表现出不同的催化性能。

关于活性Ga物种的争论仍在继续，但近期研究为我们的认知做出了贡献。研究发现，降低表面酸度可以提高直接脱氢(DDH)的催化性能。例如，向Ga/MFI催化剂中添加3-巯丙基三甲氧基硅烷(MPS)可以减少Brønsted酸位，增加Lewis酸位，从而提高性能。

这些发现强调了调整Ga基催化剂酸性质的重要性，以优化其在丙烷脱氢反应中的性能。该领域的持续研究不断完善我们对活性Ga物种及其在催化PDH反应中作用的理解。
