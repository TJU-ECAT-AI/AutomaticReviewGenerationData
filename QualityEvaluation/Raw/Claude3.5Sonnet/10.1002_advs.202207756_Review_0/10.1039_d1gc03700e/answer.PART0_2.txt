The growing demand for propylene has significantly influenced the development of new production methods, particularly propane dehydrogenation (PDH). The annual propene production was around 130 megatonnes in 2019 and is predicted to increase to 191 megatonnes by 2030. Existing processes based on steam-cracking (SC) and fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) cannot meet this expected growth in demand. As a result, direct or on-purpose processes, such as propane dehydrogenation, are being developed to fill the "propene gap."

The understanding of Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts for PDH has evolved over time. Initially, these catalysts were applied in a commercial process for propane aromatization, known as the Cyclar Process, developed jointly by UOP and BP. This application demonstrated the potential of Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts in propane conversion processes.

Recent research has contributed to our current knowledge of these catalysts, revealing that in addition to dehydrogenation, hydrogenolysis and reforming also play important roles in the reaction network. However, the performance of Ga-based catalysts, particularly metal carbides, has been found to be poor compared to typical metal oxide or supported nanoparticle catalysts.

The ongoing debate about active Ga species continues, as researchers strive to identify the most effective forms of gallium for PDH catalysis. While the literature provided does not give specific details on the current state of this debate, it is clear that understanding the nature and role of active Ga species remains a key area of investigation in the field of PDH catalysis.

丙烯需求的增长显著影响了新生产方法的发展，特别是丙烷脱氢(PDH)。2019年丙烯的年产量约为1.3亿吨，预计到2030年将增加到1.91亿吨。现有的基于蒸汽裂解(SC)和流化催化裂解(FCC)的工艺无法满足这一预期的需求增长。因此，正在开发直接或专用工艺（如丙烷脱氢）来填补这一"丙烯缺口"。

对PDH用Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂的理解随时间不断发展。最初，这些催化剂被应用于UOP和BP联合开发的商业丙烷芳构化工艺，即Cyclar工艺。这一应用展示了Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂在丙烷转化过程中的潜力。

近期研究为我们对这些催化剂的认知做出了贡献，揭示除了脱氢反应外，氢解和重整反应在反应网络中也起着重要作用。然而，与典型的金属氧化物或负载型纳米颗粒催化剂相比，镓基催化剂（特别是金属碳化物）的性能被发现较差。

关于活性镓物种的争论仍在继续，研究人员努力识别PDH催化最有效的镓形态。虽然所提供的文献没有给出这一争论当前状态的具体细节，但很明显，理解活性镓物种的性质和作用仍然是PDH催化研究领域的一个关键领域。
