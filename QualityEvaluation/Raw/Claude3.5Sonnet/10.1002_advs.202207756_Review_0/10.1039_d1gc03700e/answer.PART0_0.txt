[1] "Annual propene production was around 130 megatonnes in 20191 and is predicted to increase to 191 megatonnes by 2030. Significantly, the expected growth in propane demand cannot be met by existing processes, which are based on steam-cracking (SC) and fluid catalytic cracking (FCC). Instead, direct or on-purpose processes are being developed to fill the so-called propene gap. The focus of this critical review is on the dehydrogenation of propane."

[2] "Historically, a bifunctional Ga/H-ZSM-5 material has been applied as a catalyst for the commercial process for propane aromatization, developed jointly by UOP and BP as the Cyclar Process."

[3] "It was shown that CO2 could partially re-oxidise the catalyst and that coke formation was significantly suppressed in the presence of CO2. Han et al. examined a range of VOX loadings using an MCM-41 as a support."

The growing demand for propylene has significantly influenced the development of new production methods, particularly propane dehydrogenation (PDH). Traditional processes like steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking are unable to meet the projected increase in propylene demand, which is expected to rise from 130 megatonnes in 2019 to 191 megatonnes by 2030. This gap in supply has led to the development of direct or on-purpose processes, with a focus on propane dehydrogenation.

The understanding of Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts for PDH has evolved over time. Initially, these catalysts were used in commercial processes for propane aromatization, such as the Cyclar Process developed by UOP and BP. However, the debate about active Ga species has continued, and recent research has contributed to our current knowledge.

Recent findings have shown that CO2 can partially re-oxidize the catalyst and significantly suppress coke formation, which is a major challenge in PDH processes. Additionally, studies have explored various loadings of vanadium oxide (VOX) on supports like MCM-41, contributing to a better understanding of catalyst performance and optimization.

While the literature provided does not give extensive details on the ongoing debate about active Ga species, it does highlight the continuous research efforts to improve catalyst performance, particularly in areas such as coke suppression and the role of different supports and loadings in catalyst efficiency.

丙烯需求的增长极大地影响了新生产方法的发展，特别是丙烷脱氢（PDH）。传统的蒸汽裂解和流化催化裂解工艺无法满足预计的丙烯需求增长，预计从2019年的1.3亿吨增加到2030年的1.91亿吨。这种供应缺口导致了直接或专门工艺的开发，重点是丙烷脱氢。

对Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂在PDH中的理解随时间不断演变。最初，这些催化剂用于商业丙烷芳构化工艺，如UOP和BP开发的Cyclar工艺。然而，关于活性Ga物种的争论一直持续，近期研究为我们当前的认知做出了贡献。

最新发现表明，CO2可以部分再氧化催化剂并显著抑制积炭形成，这是PDH工艺中的一个主要挑战。此外，研究还探索了钒氧化物（VOX）在MCM-41等载体上的各种负载量，有助于更好地理解催化剂性能和优化。

虽然提供的文献没有详细介绍关于活性Ga物种的持续争论，但它确实强调了持续的研究努力，以改善催化剂性能，特别是在抑制积炭和不同载体及负载量在催化剂效率中的作用等方面。
