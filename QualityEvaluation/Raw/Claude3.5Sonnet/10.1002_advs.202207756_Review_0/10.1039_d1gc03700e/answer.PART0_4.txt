[1] "Annual propene production was around 130 megatonnes in 20191 and is predicted to increase to 191 megatonnes by 2030. Significantly, the expected growth in propane demand cannot be met by existing processes, which are based on steam-cracking (SC) and fluid catalytic cracking (FCC). Instead, direct or on-purpose processes are being developed to fill the so-called propene gap. The focus of this critical review is on the dehydrogenation of propane."

[2] "The discovery of active and selective catalysts is central to the development of these on-purpose technologies and is the focus of the current review."

[3] "Historically, a bifunctional Ga/H-ZSM-5 material has been applied as a catalyst for the commercial process for propane aromatization, developed jointly by UOP and BP as the Cyclar Process."

[4] "Gallium oxide (GaOx)-based catalysts have been the subject of intensive research as candidate catalysts and/or supports for the DDH reaction. This is because Ga is another non-noble metallic element known to catalyse the dehydrogenation of propane, usually through oxidic, tetrahedrally coordinated Ga3+ species, which are considered to be active sites for CH activation."

[5] "However, several surface gallium species (e.g., Ga2O3, GaO+ and Gan+) can exist and are considered active constituents exhibiting different performance for the DDH reaction. Furthermore, the types of surface Ga species present are dependent on the identity of the support, Ga loading, as well as the preparation method."

The growing demand for propylene has significantly influenced the development of new production methods, particularly propane dehydrogenation (PDH). The expected increase in propene demand from 130 megatonnes in 2019 to 191 megatonnes by 2030 cannot be met by existing processes like steam-cracking and fluid catalytic cracking. As a result, direct or on-purpose processes, such as propane dehydrogenation, are being developed to fill this "propene gap."

The understanding of Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts for PDH has evolved considerably over time. Initially, Ga/H-ZSM-5 was used as a bifunctional catalyst for propane aromatization in the commercial Cyclar Process. However, research has expanded to investigate gallium oxide (GaOx)-based catalysts for direct dehydrogenation of propane.

The debate about active Ga species is ongoing, with various surface gallium species (e.g., Ga2O3, GaO+, and Gan+) considered as active constituents. These species exhibit different performances for the DDH reaction. Recent research has shown that the types of surface Ga species present depend on factors such as the identity of the support, Ga loading, and preparation method.

Current knowledge suggests that tetrahedrally coordinated Ga3+ species are considered active sites for CH activation. However, the complexity of Ga species and their interactions with supports continues to be a subject of research, contributing to our evolving understanding of Ga-based catalysts for propane dehydrogenation.

丙烯需求的增长显著影响了新生产方法的发展，特别是丙烷脱氢(PDH)。预计丙烯需求将从2019年的1.3亿吨增加到2030年的1.91亿吨，现有的蒸汽裂解和流化催化裂解工艺无法满足这一需求。因此，直接或专门的工艺，如丙烷脱氢，正在被开发以填补这一"丙烯缺口"。

对Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂在PDH中的理解随时间不断发展。最初，Ga/H-ZSM-5被用作商业Cyclar工艺中丙烷芳构化的双功能催化剂。然而，研究已经扩展到探索氧化镓(GaOx)基催化剂用于丙烷直接脱氢。

关于活性Ga物种的争论仍在继续，各种表面镓物种(如Ga2O3、GaO+和Gan+)被认为是活性成分。这些物种在DDH反应中表现出不同的性能。近期研究表明，存在的表面Ga物种类型取决于诸如载体的特性、Ga负载量和制备方法等因素。

当前的认知表明，四面体配位的Ga3+物种被认为是CH活化的活性位点。然而，Ga物种的复杂性及其与载体的相互作用仍然是研究的主题，这些研究继续丰富我们对基于Ga的丙烷脱氢催化剂的理解。
