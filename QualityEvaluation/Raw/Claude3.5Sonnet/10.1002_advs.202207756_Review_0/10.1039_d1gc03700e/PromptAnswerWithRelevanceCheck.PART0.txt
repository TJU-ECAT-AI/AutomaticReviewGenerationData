[1] "Annual propene production was around 130 megatonnes in 20191 and is predicted to increase to 191 megatonnes by 2030. Significantly, the expected growth in propane demand cannot be met by existing processes, which are based on steam-cracking (SC) and fluid catalytic cracking (FCC). Instead, direct or on-purpose processes are being developed to fill the so-called propene gap. The focus of this critical review is on the dehydrogenation of propane."

[2] "Historically, a bifunctional Ga/H-ZSM-5 material has been applied as a catalyst for the commercial process for propane aromatization, developed jointly by UOP and BP as the Cyclar Process."

[3] "It was shown that CO2 could partially re-oxidise the catalyst and that coke formation was significantly suppressed in the presence of CO2. Han et al. examined a range of VOX loadings using an MCM-41 as a support."

The growing demand for propylene has significantly influenced the development of new production methods, particularly propane dehydrogenation (PDH). Traditional processes like steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking are unable to meet the projected increase in propylene demand, which is expected to rise from 130 megatonnes in 2019 to 191 megatonnes by 2030. This gap in supply has led to the development of direct or on-purpose processes, with a focus on propane dehydrogenation.

The understanding of Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts for PDH has evolved over time. Initially, these catalysts were used in commercial processes for propane aromatization, such as the Cyclar Process developed by UOP and BP. However, the debate about active Ga species has continued, and recent research has contributed to our current knowledge.

Recent findings have shown that CO2 can partially re-oxidize the catalyst and significantly suppress coke formation, which is a major challenge in PDH processes. Additionally, studies have explored various loadings of vanadium oxide (VOX) on supports like MCM-41, contributing to a better understanding of catalyst performance and optimization.

While the literature provided does not give extensive details on the ongoing debate about active Ga species, it does highlight the continuous research efforts to improve catalyst performance, particularly in areas such as coke suppression and the role of different supports and loadings in catalyst efficiency.

丙烯需求的增长极大地影响了新生产方法的发展，特别是丙烷脱氢（PDH）。传统的蒸汽裂解和流化催化裂解工艺无法满足预计的丙烯需求增长，预计从2019年的1.3亿吨增加到2030年的1.91亿吨。这种供应缺口导致了直接或专门工艺的开发，重点是丙烷脱氢。

对Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂在PDH中的理解随时间不断演变。最初，这些催化剂用于商业丙烷芳构化工艺，如UOP和BP开发的Cyclar工艺。然而，关于活性Ga物种的争论一直持续，近期研究为我们当前的认知做出了贡献。

最新发现表明，CO2可以部分再氧化催化剂并显著抑制积炭形成，这是PDH工艺中的一个主要挑战。此外，研究还探索了钒氧化物（VOX）在MCM-41等载体上的各种负载量，有助于更好地理解催化剂性能和优化。

虽然提供的文献没有详细介绍关于活性Ga物种的持续争论，但它确实强调了持续的研究努力，以改善催化剂性能，特别是在抑制积炭和不同载体及负载量在催化剂效率中的作用等方面。

With propylene production expected to increase from 130 megatonnes in 2019 to 191 megatonnes by 2030, existing processes like steam-cracking and fluid catalytic cracking cannot meet this demand. As a result, direct or on-purpose processes, such as propane dehydrogenation, are being developed to fill the "propene gap."

The understanding of Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts for PDH has evolved over time. Initially, Ga/H-ZSM-5 was used as a bifunctional catalyst for propane aromatization in the commercial Cyclar Process. However, research has shown that Ga can catalyze propane dehydrogenation through various species.

There is an ongoing debate about the active Ga species in PDH catalysts. While tetrahedrally coordinated Ga3+ species are considered active sites for C-H activation, other surface gallium species such as Ga2O3, GaO+, and Gan+ are also thought to be active constituents. The presence and performance of these different Ga species depend on factors such as the support material, Ga loading, and preparation method.

Recent research has contributed to our current knowledge by highlighting the complexity of Ga-based catalysts. The findings suggest that multiple Ga species can coexist on the catalyst surface, each potentially contributing to the overall catalytic performance in different ways. This understanding has led to efforts in optimizing catalyst preparation methods and support materials to control the distribution and nature of active Ga species, ultimately aiming to improve the efficiency of propane dehydrogenation processes.

对Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂在PDH中的理解随时间不断演变。最初,Ga/H-ZSM-5被用作商业Cyclar工艺中丙烷芳构化的双功能催化剂。然而,研究表明Ga可以通过多种物种催化丙烷脱氢。

关于PDH催化剂中活性Ga物种的争论仍在继续。虽然四面体配位的Ga3+物种被认为是C-H活化的活性位点,但其他表面镓物种如Ga2O3、GaO+和Gan+也被认为是活性成分。这些不同Ga物种的存在和性能取决于支撑材料、Ga负载量和制备方法等因素。

最近的研究通过强调Ga基催化剂的复杂性,为我们当前的认知做出了贡献。研究结果表明,多种Ga物种可以共存于催化剂表面,每种物种可能以不同方式对整体催化性能做出贡献。这种理解促使人们努力优化催化剂制备方法和支撑材料,以控制活性Ga物种的分布和性质,最终旨在提高丙烷脱氢过程的效率。

The ongoing debate about active Ga species continues, as researchers strive to identify the most effective forms of gallium for PDH catalysis. While the literature provided does not give specific details on the current state of this debate, it is clear that understanding the nature and role of active Ga species remains a key area of investigation in the field of PDH catalysis.

丙烯需求的增长显著影响了新生产方法的发展，特别是丙烷脱氢(PDH)。2019年丙烯的年产量约为1.3亿吨，预计到2030年将增加到1.91亿吨。现有的基于蒸汽裂解(SC)和流化催化裂解(FCC)的工艺无法满足这一预期的需求增长。因此，正在开发直接或专用工艺（如丙烷脱氢）来填补这一"丙烯缺口"。

对PDH用Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂的理解随时间不断发展。最初，这些催化剂被应用于UOP和BP联合开发的商业丙烷芳构化工艺，即Cyclar工艺。这一应用展示了Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂在丙烷转化过程中的潜力。

近期研究为我们对这些催化剂的认知做出了贡献，揭示除了脱氢反应外，氢解和重整反应在反应网络中也起着重要作用。然而，与典型的金属氧化物或负载型纳米颗粒催化剂相比，镓基催化剂（特别是金属碳化物）的性能被发现较差。

关于活性镓物种的争论仍在继续，研究人员努力识别PDH催化最有效的镓形态。虽然所提供的文献没有给出这一争论当前状态的具体细节，但很明显，理解活性镓物种的性质和作用仍然是PDH催化研究领域的一个关键领域。

For example, the addition of 3-mercaptopropyl-trimethoxysilane (MPS) to Ga/MFI catalysts reduces Brønsted acid sites and increases Lewis acid sites, resulting in improved performance.

These findings highlight the importance of tailoring the acidic properties of Ga-based catalysts to optimize their performance in propane dehydrogenation reactions. The ongoing research in this area continues to refine our understanding of the active Ga species and their role in catalyzing the PDH reaction.

对Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂在PDH中的理解随时间不断发展。最初，Ga/H-ZSM-5作为双功能催化剂用于商业Cyclar工艺中的丙烷芳构化。研究表明，负载在不同材料上的Ga2O3，包括H-ZSM-5，在烷烃脱氢反应中表现出不同的催化性能。

关于活性Ga物种的争论仍在继续，但近期研究为我们的认知做出了贡献。研究发现，降低表面酸度可以提高直接脱氢(DDH)的催化性能。例如，向Ga/MFI催化剂中添加3-巯丙基三甲氧基硅烷(MPS)可以减少Brønsted酸位，增加Lewis酸位，从而提高性能。

这些发现强调了调整Ga基催化剂酸性质的重要性，以优化其在丙烷脱氢反应中的性能。该领域的持续研究不断完善我们对活性Ga物种及其在催化PDH反应中作用的理解。
