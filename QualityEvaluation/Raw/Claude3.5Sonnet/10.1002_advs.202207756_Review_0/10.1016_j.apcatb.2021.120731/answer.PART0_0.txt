The growing demand for propylene has led to rising market prices and stimulated the development of new production methods, particularly propane dehydrogenation (PDH). Pt-based catalysts have been widely used in industrial PDH processes due to their desirable performance, longer reaction lifetime, and environmental friendliness. 

The understanding of Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts for PDH has evolved with the recognition that Ga can act as a co-catalyst to regulate the strong metal-support interaction (SMSI) between the metal and oxide support. This helps maintain the dispersion of Pt species, which is crucial for catalyst performance. 

However, the literature provided does not contain specific information about the ongoing debate regarding active Ga species or recent research findings that have contributed to our current knowledge of Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts for PDH. The focus of the given text is primarily on Pt-Ga catalysts supported on alumina rather than on Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts.

由于丙烯需求的增长导致市场价格上涨，刺激了新生产方法的发展，特别是丙烷脱氢(PDH)。铂基催化剂因其理想的性能、较长的反应寿命和环境友好性而被广泛用于工业PDH过程。

对Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂在PDH中的理解已经发展到认识到Ga可以作为助催化剂来调节金属和氧化物支撑物之间的强金属-支撑物相互作用(SMSI)。这有助于维持铂物种的分散性，这对催化剂性能至关重要。

然而，所提供的文献中并不包含关于活性Ga物种的持续争论或最近对我们当前了解Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂用于PDH的研究发现的具体信息。给定文本的重点主要是在氧化铝上负载的Pt-Ga催化剂，而不是Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂。
