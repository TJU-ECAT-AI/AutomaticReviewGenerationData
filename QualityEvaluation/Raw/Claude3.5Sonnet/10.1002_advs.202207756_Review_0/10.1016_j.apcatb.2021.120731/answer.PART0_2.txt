The growing demand for propylene has led to rising market prices, spurring the development of new production methods like propane dehydrogenation (PDH). Pt-based catalysts have been widely used for PDH due to their desirable performance, longer reaction lifetime, and environmental friendliness. 

To improve PDH catalysts, researchers have explored post-transition metal elements like Ga as co-catalysts. These co-catalysts enhance the dispersion, geometric structure, and electronic properties of Pt, leading to increased activity, selectivity, stability, and anti-coking performance.

The introduction of Ga as a co-catalyst species helps regulate the strong metal-support interaction (SMSI) between the metal and oxide support, which aids in maintaining the dispersion of Pt species. This has contributed to our current understanding of Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts for PDH.

However, the literature provided does not specifically discuss the ongoing debate about active Ga species or recent research findings related to Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts. More information would be needed to address these aspects of the question comprehensively.

丙烯需求的增长导致市场价格上涨，促进了新生产方法如丙烷脱氢(PDH)的发展。由于性能优异、反应寿命长和环境友好性，铂基催化剂被广泛用于PDH反应。

为改进PDH催化剂，研究人员探索了镓等后过渡金属元素作为助催化剂。这些助催化剂提高了铂的分散性、几何结构和电子性质，从而提高了活性、选择性、稳定性和抗结焦性能。

引入镓作为助催化剂有助于调节金属与氧化物支撑体之间的强金属-支撑体相互作用(SMSI)，这有助于保持铂物种的分散性。这些发现为我们理解Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂在PDH中的应用做出了贡献。

然而，所提供的文献并未具体讨论关于活性镓物种的持续争论或与Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂相关的最新研究发现。要全面回答这些问题，需要更多的信息。
