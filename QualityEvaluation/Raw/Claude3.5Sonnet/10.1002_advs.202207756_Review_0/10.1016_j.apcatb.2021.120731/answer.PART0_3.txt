The growing demand for propylene has significantly influenced the development of new production methods, particularly propane dehydrogenation (PDH). The increasing global demand for propylene has led to rising market prices, prompting efforts to transform propane into propylene. This has been further stimulated by the large-scale production of propane from shale gas extraction. As a result, PDH has emerged as an important process, with Pt-based catalysts being extensively used in industrial applications due to their desirable performance, longer reaction lifetime, and environmental friendliness.

However, the literature provided does not contain specific information about the evolution of understanding regarding Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts for PDH, the ongoing debate about active Ga species, or recent research findings contributing to our current knowledge of these catalysts. The focus of the given text is primarily on Pt-based and PtGa-based catalysts supported on Al2O3, rather than Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts.

丙烯需求的增长显著影响了新生产方法的发展，特别是丙烷脱氢(PDH)。全球对丙烯的需求不断增加导致市场价格上涨，促使人们努力将丙烷转化为丙烯。这一趋势进一步受到页岩气开采带来的大规模丙烷生产的刺激。因此，PDH已成为一个重要的过程，其中铂基催化剂因其理想的性能、更长的反应寿命和环境友好性而被广泛应用于工业生产。

然而，所提供的文献中并不包含关于Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂在PDH中的理解演变、活性Ga物种的持续争论，或是近期研究发现对这些催化剂当前认知贡献的具体信息。给定文本主要关注的是以Al2O3为载体的铂基和铂镓基催化剂，而非Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂。
