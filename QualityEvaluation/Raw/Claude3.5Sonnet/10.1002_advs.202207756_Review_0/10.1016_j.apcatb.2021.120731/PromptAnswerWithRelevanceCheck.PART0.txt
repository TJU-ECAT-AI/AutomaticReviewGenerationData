[1] "Due to the increasing global demand for propylene, the market price of propylene has been rising accompanied with the booming trend of industrial development"

[2] "To date, Pt-based catalysts have been extensively used as industrial catalysts for propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) with a desirable performance in Oleflex process for its longer reaction lifetime and more environmental friendly"

[3] "The introduction of co-catalyst species such as Ga could regulate the strong metal-support interaction (SMSI) between metal and oxide support, and further help to maintain the dispersion of Pt species"

</quotes>

<EnglishVersionAnswer>

The growing demand for propylene has led to rising market prices and stimulated the development of new production methods, particularly propane dehydrogenation (PDH). Pt-based catalysts have been widely used in industrial PDH processes due to their desirable performance, longer reaction lifetime, and environmental friendliness. 

The understanding of Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts for PDH has evolved with the recognition that Ga can act as a co-catalyst to regulate the strong metal-support interaction (SMSI) between the metal and oxide support. This helps maintain the dispersion of Pt species, which is crucial for catalyst performance. 

However, the literature provided does not contain specific information about the ongoing debate regarding active Ga species or recent research findings that have contributed to our current knowledge of Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts for PDH. The focus of the given text is primarily on Pt-Ga catalysts supported on alumina rather than on Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts.

由于丙烯需求的增长导致市场价格上涨，刺激了新生产方法的发展，特别是丙烷脱氢(PDH)。铂基催化剂因其理想的性能、较长的反应寿命和环境友好性而被广泛用于工业PDH过程。

对Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂在PDH中的理解已经发展到认识到Ga可以作为助催化剂来调节金属和氧化物支撑物之间的强金属-支撑物相互作用(SMSI)。这有助于维持铂物种的分散性，这对催化剂性能至关重要。

然而，所提供的文献中并不包含关于活性Ga物种的持续争论或最近对我们当前了解Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂用于PDH的研究发现的具体信息。给定文本的重点主要是在氧化铝上负载的Pt-Ga催化剂，而不是Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂。

[1] "Propylene is one of the most important building blocks for industrial production to many chemical products including polypropylene, which is an essential material to prepare non-woven fabric for personal protection equipment amid global COVID-19"

[2] "Due to the increasing global demand for propylene, the market price of propylene has been rising accompanied with the booming trend of industrial development"

[3] "Therefore, many efforts have been devoted to the transformation of propane into propylene stimulated by the large scale production of propane by the development of shale-gas extraction"

The growing demand for propylene has significantly influenced the development of new production methods, particularly propane dehydrogenation (PDH). The increasing global demand for propylene has led to rising market prices, which has stimulated efforts to develop more efficient production methods. The large-scale production of propane from shale gas extraction has further motivated research into propane-to-propylene conversion processes.

PDH has emerged as a promising method for propylene production, with Pt-based catalysts being extensively used in industrial applications due to their desirable performance, longer reaction lifetime, and environmental friendliness. However, the literature provided does not contain specific information about the evolution of understanding Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts for PDH, the ongoing debate about active Ga species, or recent research findings related to these catalysts. The focus of the given text is primarily on Pt-based catalysts and their modifications, rather than Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts.

The growing demand for propylene has led to rising market prices, spurring the development of new production methods like propane dehydrogenation (PDH). Pt-based catalysts have been widely used for PDH due to their desirable performance, longer reaction lifetime, and environmental friendliness. 

To improve PDH catalysts, researchers have explored post-transition metal elements like Ga as co-catalysts. These co-catalysts enhance the dispersion, geometric structure, and electronic properties of Pt, leading to increased activity, selectivity, stability, and anti-coking performance.

The introduction of Ga as a co-catalyst species helps regulate the strong metal-support interaction (SMSI) between the metal and oxide support, which aids in maintaining the dispersion of Pt species. This has contributed to our current understanding of Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts for PDH.

However, the literature provided does not specifically discuss the ongoing debate about active Ga species or recent research findings related to Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts. More information would be needed to address these aspects of the question comprehensively.

丙烯需求的增长导致市场价格上涨，促进了新生产方法如丙烷脱氢(PDH)的发展。由于性能优异、反应寿命长和环境友好性，铂基催化剂被广泛用于PDH反应。

为改进PDH催化剂，研究人员探索了镓等后过渡金属元素作为助催化剂。这些助催化剂提高了铂的分散性、几何结构和电子性质，从而提高了活性、选择性、稳定性和抗结焦性能。

引入镓作为助催化剂有助于调节金属与氧化物支撑体之间的强金属-支撑体相互作用(SMSI)，这有助于保持铂物种的分散性。这些发现为我们理解Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂在PDH中的应用做出了贡献。

然而，所提供的文献并未具体讨论关于活性镓物种的持续争论或与Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂相关的最新研究发现。要全面回答这些问题，需要更多的信息。
