The growing demand for propylene has significantly influenced the development of new production methods, particularly propane dehydrogenation (PDH). The increasing global demand for propylene has led to rising market prices, which has stimulated efforts to develop more efficient production methods. The large-scale production of propane from shale gas extraction has further motivated research into propane-to-propylene conversion processes.

PDH has emerged as a promising method for propylene production, with Pt-based catalysts being extensively used in industrial applications due to their desirable performance, longer reaction lifetime, and environmental friendliness. However, the literature provided does not contain specific information about the evolution of understanding Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts for PDH, the ongoing debate about active Ga species, or recent research findings related to these catalysts. The focus of the given text is primarily on Pt-based catalysts and their modifications, rather than Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts.

丙烯需求的增长显著影响了新生产方法的发展，特别是丙烷脱氢（PDH）。丙烯的全球需求增加导致市场价格上涨，这刺激了开发更高效生产方法的努力。页岩气开采带来的大规模丙烷生产进一步推动了丙烷转化为丙烯过程的研究。

PDH已成为丙烯生产的一种有前景的方法，其中铂基催化剂因其理想的性能、更长的反应寿命和环境友好性而被广泛应用于工业生产。然而，所提供的文献并不包含有关Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂在PDH中的理解演变、活性Ga物种的持续争论或与这些催化剂相关的最新研究发现的具体信息。给定文本的重点主要是铂基催化剂及其改性，而不是Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂。
