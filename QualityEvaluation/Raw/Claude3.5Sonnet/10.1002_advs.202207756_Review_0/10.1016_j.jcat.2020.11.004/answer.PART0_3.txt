[1] "Propylene plays a central role in the chemical industry infrastructure and it is used for the production of a wide range of chemicals, including polypropylene, acrylonitrile, propylene oxide, and cymene"

[2] "However, there has been a growing gap between the demand and supply of propylene, due to a marked increase in the abundance of natural gas as a feedstock"

[3] "Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) is potentially an effective alternative to producing propylene, and two PDH processes, i.e., the Catofin process with a CrOx/Al2O3 catalyst and the Oleflex process using a Pt-based catalyst, have been commercialized"

[5] "Schreiber et al. [10] reported that the Ga+H+ paired sites were more active than single Ga+ sites and the parent H-ZSM-5 catalyst based on a combination of reactivity, quantitative pulse reactions, and DFT calculations. The hypothesis of Ga+H+ pair sites and isolated Ga+ species having different reactivities has been put forth in recent investigations by both the Bell and the Lercher groups [911,21], however, the existence of these distinct sites is largely indirect; inferred from reactivity data, indirect experimental characterizations and computational investigations."

The growing demand for propylene has led to a gap between supply and demand, primarily due to the increased use of natural gas as a feedstock. This has driven the development of new production methods, particularly propane dehydrogenation (PDH). Two commercial PDH processes have been developed: the Catofin process using CrOx/Al2O3 catalysts and the Oleflex process using Pt-based catalysts.

Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts have long been recognized as efficient for both dehydrogenation and dehydroaromatization of alkanes. However, despite decades of research, the understanding of these catalysts for PDH has evolved slowly, with ongoing debates about Ga speciation, the identity of catalytic active sites, and the reaction mechanism.

Recent research has contributed to our current knowledge of these catalysts. Schreiber et al. reported that Ga+H+ paired sites were more active than single Ga+ sites and the parent H-ZSM-5 catalyst. This hypothesis of different reactivities between Ga+H+ pair sites and isolated Ga+ species has been supported by recent investigations from both the Bell and Lercher groups. However, the existence of these distinct sites has largely been inferred indirectly from reactivity data, indirect experimental characterizations, and computational investigations, rather than direct experimental evidence.

丙烯需求的增长导致了供需之间的差距，主要是由于天然气作为原料的使用增加。这推动了新生产方法的发展，特别是丙烷脱氢（PDH）。两种商业PDH工艺已经开发出来：使用CrOx/Al2O3催化剂的Catofin工艺和使用Pt基催化剂的Oleflex工艺。

Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂长期以来被认为是烷烃脱氢和脱芳构化的高效催化剂。然而，尽管经过数十年的研究，对这些催化剂在PDH中的理解仍在缓慢演进，关于Ga物种、催化活性位点的身份和反应机理仍存在争议。

近期的研究为我们对这些催化剂的认知做出了贡献。Schreiber等人报道Ga+H+配对位点比单一Ga+位点和母体H-ZSM-5催化剂更活跃。Bell和Lercher组的最新研究也支持了Ga+H+配对位点和孤立Ga+物种具有不同反应活性的假说。然而，这些不同位点的存在主要是通过反应活性数据、间接实验表征和计算机模拟推断得出的，而非直接的实验证据。
