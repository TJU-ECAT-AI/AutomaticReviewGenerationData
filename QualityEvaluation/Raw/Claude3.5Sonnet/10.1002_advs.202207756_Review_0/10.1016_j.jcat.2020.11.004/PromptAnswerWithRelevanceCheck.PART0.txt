The growing demand for propylene has significantly influenced the development of new production methods, particularly propane dehydrogenation (PDH). This is due to an increasing gap between propylene supply and demand, largely caused by the increased use of natural gas as a feedstock in the chemical industry. PDH has emerged as a promising alternative for propylene production, with two commercial processes already in place: the Catofin process using CrOx/Al2O3 catalysts and the Oleflex process using Pt-based catalysts.

However, concerns over the high cost of Pt and the health and environmental issues associated with Cr have driven research into alternative PDH catalysts. Among these, Ga/H-ZSM-5 has been recognized as an efficient catalyst for both dehydrogenation and dehydroaromatization of alkanes. Despite decades of research, the understanding of Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts for PDH continues to evolve, with ongoing debates about Ga speciation, the identity of catalytic active sites, and the reaction mechanism.

Various experimental techniques have been employed to probe Ga speciation in Ga/H-ZSM-5 and identify the active sites in PDH reactions. These include in-situ Ga K edge X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES), ex-situ FTIR, and NH3-temperature-programmed desorption (NH3-TPD). Recent research findings have contributed significantly to our current knowledge of these catalysts:

1. Hensen and coworkers identified Ga monohydride and dihydride species on reduced Ga/H-ZSM-5 using DRIFTS, suggesting these species could play an active role in PDH.

2. Phadke et al. proposed that single [GaH]2+ sites are the active centers for the PDH reaction, with catalyst reactivity independent of the Ga/Al ratio.

3. Schreiber et al. reported that Ga+H+ paired sites were more active than single Ga+ sites and the parent H-ZSM-5 catalyst, based on a combination of reactivity studies, quantitative pulse reactions, and DFT calculations.

These diverse findings highlight the ongoing debate and complexity surrounding the nature of active Ga species in Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts for PDH reactions, emphasizing the need for further research to fully understand and optimize these catalysts for industrial applications.

丙烯需求的增长显著影响了新生产方法的开发，特别是丙烷脱氢(PDH)。这是由于丙烯供需之间的差距不断扩大，主要是因为化学工业中天然气作为原料的使用增加。PDH已经成为丙烯生产的一种有前景的替代方法，目前已有两种商业化工艺：使用CrOx/Al2O3催化剂的Catofin工艺和使用Pt基催化剂的Oleflex工艺。

然而，由于Pt的高成本以及与Cr相关的健康和环境问题，推动了对替代PDH催化剂的研究。在这些替代催化剂中，Ga/H-ZSM-5被认为是烷烃脱氢和脱氢芳构化的高效催化剂。尽管经过几十年的研究，对Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂在PDH中的理解仍在不断发展，关于Ga物种、催化活性位点的本质和反应机理仍存在争议。

研究人员采用了各种实验技术来探究Ga/H-ZSM-5中的Ga物种和识别PDH反应中的活性位点。这些技术包括原位Ga K边X射线吸收近边结构(XANES)、非原位FTIR和NH3程序升温脱附(NH3-TPD)。近期的研究发现对我们目前对这些催化剂的认知做出了重要贡献：

1. Hensen及其同事使用DRIFTS在还原的Ga/H-ZSM-5上识别出Ga单氢化物和双氢化物物种，表明这些物种可能在PDH中起活性作用。

2. Phadke等人提出单一的[GaH]2+位点是PDH反应的活性中心，催化剂活性与Ga/Al比无关。

3. Schreiber等人基于反应活性研究、定量脉冲反应和DFT计算的组合，报告了Ga+H+配对位点比单一Ga+位点和母体H-ZSM-5催化剂更活跃。

这些不同的研究发现突显了关于Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂中活性Ga物种本质的持续争论和复杂性，强调了需要进一步研究以充分理解和优化这些催化剂用于工业应用。

The growing demand for propylene has led to the development of new production methods, particularly propane dehydrogenation (PDH), due to the increasing gap between propylene demand and supply. This gap has been caused by the increased use of natural gas as a feedstock, which has reduced the production of propylene as a by-product from traditional sources like naphtha steam crackers and fluidized catalytic cracking units.

PDH has emerged as an effective alternative for propylene production, with two commercial processes already in operation: the Catofin process using a CrOx/Al2O3 catalyst and the Oleflex process using a Pt-based catalyst. Among the various catalysts being studied for PDH, Ga/H-ZSM-5 has been recognized as an efficient catalyst for both dehydrogenation and dehydroaromatization of alkanes.

However, the understanding of Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts for PDH has evolved over time, with ongoing debates about the nature of active Ga species and reaction mechanisms. Despite decades of research, these topics remain active areas of discussion. Various experimental techniques, including in-situ XANES, ex-situ FTIR, and NH3-TPD, have been employed to probe Ga speciation in Ga/H-ZSM-5 and identify the active sites for the PDH reaction.

Recent research findings have contributed to our current knowledge of these catalysts, but have also revealed conflicting views. For instance, Phadke et al. proposed that single [GaH]2+ sites are the active centers for the PDH reaction, with catalyst reactivity independent of the Ga/Al ratio. This was supported by FTIR spectroscopy, NH3-TPD results, and thermodynamic stability analysis. In contrast, Schreiber et al. reported that Ga+H+ paired sites were more active than single Ga+ sites and the parent H-ZSM-5 catalyst, based on a combination of reactivity studies, quantitative pulse reactions, and DFT calculations.

These conflicting findings highlight the complexity of Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts and the ongoing need for further research to fully understand their behavior in PDH reactions. The evolution of our understanding of these catalysts demonstrates the challenges in identifying the exact nature of active sites and reaction mechanisms in heterogeneous catalysis.

丙烯需求的增长导致了新的生产方法的开发，特别是丙烷脱氢(PDH)，这是由于丙烯需求和供应之间的差距不断扩大。这种差距是由于天然气作为原料的使用增加，减少了传统来源如石脑油蒸汽裂解器和流化催化裂化装置的丙烯副产品生产。

PDH已经成为丙烯生产的有效替代方法，目前已有两种商业化工艺：使用CrOx/Al2O3催化剂的Catofin工艺和使用基于Pt催化剂的Oleflex工艺。在研究的各种PDH催化剂中，Ga/H-ZSM-5被认为是烷烃脱氢和芳构化的高效催化剂。

然而，对Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂在PDH中的理解随时间不断演变，关于活性Ga物种的本质和反应机理的争论仍在继续。尽管经过数十年的研究，这些话题仍然是活跃的讨论领域。各种实验技术，包括原位XANES、非原位FTIR和NH3-TPD，已被用于探测Ga/H-ZSM-5中的Ga物种分布并识别PDH反应的活性位点。

最近的研究发现为我们对这些催化剂的认知做出了贡献，但也揭示了一些相互矛盾的观点。例如，Phadke等人提出单一的[GaH]2+位点是PDH反应的活性中心，催化剂活性与Ga/Al比无关。这一观点得到了FTIR光谱、NH3-TPD结果和热力学稳定性分析的支持。相反，Schreiber等人报告称，基于反应活性研究、定量脉冲反应和DFT计算的结果，Ga+H+配对位点比单一Ga+位点和母体H-ZSM-5催化剂更活跃。

这些相互矛盾的发现突出了Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂的复杂性，以及需要进一步研究以充分理解它们在PDH反应中的行为。我们对这些催化剂理解的演变表明，在多相催化中确定活性位点和反应机理的确切性质仍然面临挑战。

The hypothesis that Ga+H+ pair sites and isolated Ga+ species have different reactivities has been put forth in recent investigations by both the Bell and Lercher groups. However, the existence of these distinct sites is largely based on indirect evidence, inferred from reactivity data, indirect experimental characterizations, and computational investigations.
