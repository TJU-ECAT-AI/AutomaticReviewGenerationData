The growing demand for propylene has led to increased interest in developing new production methods, particularly propane dehydrogenation (PDH). This is due to a widening gap between propylene supply and demand, caused by the increased use of natural gas as a feedstock. PDH has emerged as a promising alternative for propylene production, with two commercial processes already in operation: the Catofin process using CrOx/Al2O3 catalysts and the Oleflex process using Pt-based catalysts.

Among various catalysts studied for PDH, Ga/H-ZSM-5 has long been recognized as an efficient option for both dehydrogenation and dehydroaromatization of alkanes. However, despite decades of research, there is still ongoing debate about the nature of Ga speciation, the identity of catalytic active sites, and the reaction mechanism in PDH using Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts.

Researchers have employed various experimental techniques to probe Ga speciation in Ga/H-ZSM-5 and identify active sites for PDH. These include in-situ Ga K edge X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES), ex-situ FTIR, and NH3-temperature-programmed desorption (NH3-TPD). Recent studies have contributed to our current knowledge of these catalysts, but with conflicting findings. For instance, Phadke et al. proposed that single [GaH]2+ sites are the active centers for PDH, with catalyst reactivity independent of the Ga/Al ratio. In contrast, Schreiber et al. reported that Ga+H+ paired sites were more active than single Ga+ sites and the parent H-ZSM-5 catalyst, based on a combination of reactivity studies, quantitative pulse reactions, and DFT calculations.

These ongoing debates and recent research findings highlight the complexity of Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts and underscore the need for further investigation to fully understand their behavior in PDH reactions.

丙烯需求的增长推动了新生产方法的开发，特别是丙烷脱氢（PDH）。这是由于天然气作为原料的使用增加，导致丙烯供需差距不断扩大。PDH已成为丙烯生产的一种有前景的替代方法，目前已有两种商业化工艺：使用CrOx/Al2O3催化剂的Catofin工艺和使用基于Pt催化剂的Oleflex工艺。

在研究的各种PDH催化剂中，Ga/H-ZSM-5长期以来被认为是烷烃脱氢和脱芳构化的有效选择。然而，尽管经过数十年的研究，关于使用Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂进行PDH的Ga物种性质、催化活性位点的身份和反应机理仍存在争议。

研究人员采用了各种实验技术来探索Ga/H-ZSM-5中的Ga物种和识别PDH的活性位点。这些技术包括原位Ga K边X射线吸收近边结构（XANES）、非原位FTIR和NH3程序升温脱附（NH3-TPD）。最近的研究为我们对这些催化剂的了解做出了贡献，但结果存在分歧。例如，Phadke等人提出单一的[GaH]2+位点是PDH的活性中心，催化剂的反应活性与Ga/Al比率无关。相比之下，Schreiber等人报告称，基于反应活性研究、定量脉冲反应和DFT计算的结合，Ga+H+配对位点比单一Ga+位点和母体H-ZSM-5催化剂更活跃。

这些持续的争论和最近的研究发现突显了Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂的复杂性，并强调了需要进一步研究以充分理解它们在PDH反应中的行为。
