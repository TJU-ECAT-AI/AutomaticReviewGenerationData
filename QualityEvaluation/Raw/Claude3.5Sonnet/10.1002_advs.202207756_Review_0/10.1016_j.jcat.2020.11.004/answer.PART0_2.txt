The growing demand for propylene has led to the development of new production methods, particularly propane dehydrogenation (PDH). This is due to a widening gap between propylene demand and supply, caused by increased use of natural gas as a feedstock. PDH has emerged as an effective alternative for propylene production, with two commercial processes already in place: the Catofin process using CrOx/Al2O3 catalysts and the Oleflex process using Pt-based catalysts.

Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts have long been recognized as efficient for both dehydrogenation and dehydroaromatization of alkanes. However, despite decades of research, there is still active discussion and debate about Ga speciation, the identity of catalytic active sites, and the reaction mechanism of the PDH reaction using these catalysts.

The understanding of Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts for PDH has evolved through various experimental techniques, including in-situ Ga K edge X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES), ex-situ FTIR, and NH3-temperature-programmed desorption (NH3-TPD). These techniques have been used to probe Ga speciation and identify active sites in the PDH reaction.

Recent research has contributed to our current knowledge of these catalysts, but there are still conflicting findings. For instance, Phadke et al. proposed that single [GaH]2+ sites are the active centers for the PDH reaction, with catalyst reactivity independent of the Ga/Al ratio. On the other hand, Schreiber et al. reported that Ga+H+ paired sites were more active than single Ga+ sites and the parent H-ZSM-5 catalyst.

The hypothesis that Ga+H+ pair sites and isolated Ga+ species have different reactivities has been put forth in recent investigations by both the Bell and Lercher groups. However, the existence of these distinct sites is largely based on indirect evidence, inferred from reactivity data, indirect experimental characterizations, and computational investigations. This ongoing debate highlights the complexity of understanding Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts and the need for further research to definitively identify and characterize the active species in PDH reactions.

由于丙烯需求的不断增长，新的生产方法得到了发展，特别是丙烷脱氢(PDH)。这是因为丙烯的需求和供应之间的差距不断扩大，这是由于天然气作为原料的使用增加所致。PDH已经成为丙烯生产的有效替代方法，目前已有两种商业化工艺：使用CrOx/Al2O3催化剂的Catofin工艺和使用基于Pt的催化剂的Oleflex工艺。

Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂长期以来被认为是烷烃脱氢和脱芳构化的高效催化剂。然而，尽管经过几十年的研究，关于使用这些催化剂进行PDH反应的Ga物种、催化活性位点的身份以及反应机理仍然存在活跃的讨论和争论。

对Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂用于PDH的理解已经通过各种实验技术得到了发展，包括原位Ga K边X射线吸收近边结构(XANES)、非原位FTIR和NH3程序升温脱附(NH3-TPD)。这些技术被用于探测Ga物种和识别PDH反应中的活性位点。

最近的研究为我们对这些催化剂的当前认知做出了贡献，但仍存在一些矛盾的发现。例如，Phadke等人提出单一的[GaH]2+位点是PDH反应的活性中心，催化剂活性与Ga/Al比无关。另一方面，Schreiber等人报告说，Ga+H+成对位点比单一Ga+位点和母体H-ZSM-5催化剂更活跃。

Bell和Lercher两个研究组在最近的研究中提出了Ga+H+成对位点和孤立Ga+物种具有不同反应活性的假设。然而，这些不同位点的存在主要基于间接证据，是从反应活性数据、间接实验表征和计算机模拟推断出来的。这种持续的争论突显了理解Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂的复杂性，以及需要进一步研究以明确识别和表征PDH反应中的活性物种。
