The growing demand for propylene has significantly influenced the development of new production methods, particularly propane dehydrogenation (PDH). This is due to an increasing gap between propylene supply and demand, largely caused by the increased use of natural gas as a feedstock in the chemical industry. PDH has emerged as a promising alternative for propylene production, with two commercial processes already in place: the Catofin process using CrOx/Al2O3 catalysts and the Oleflex process using Pt-based catalysts.

However, concerns over the high cost of Pt and the health and environmental issues associated with Cr have driven research into alternative PDH catalysts. Among these, Ga/H-ZSM-5 has been recognized as an efficient catalyst for both dehydrogenation and dehydroaromatization of alkanes. Despite decades of research, the understanding of Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts for PDH continues to evolve, with ongoing debates about Ga speciation, the identity of catalytic active sites, and the reaction mechanism.

Various experimental techniques have been employed to probe Ga speciation in Ga/H-ZSM-5 and identify the active sites in PDH reactions. These include in-situ Ga K edge X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES), ex-situ FTIR, and NH3-temperature-programmed desorption (NH3-TPD). Recent research findings have contributed significantly to our current knowledge of these catalysts:

1. Hensen and coworkers identified Ga monohydride and dihydride species on reduced Ga/H-ZSM-5 using DRIFTS, suggesting these species could play an active role in PDH.

2. Phadke et al. proposed that single [GaH]2+ sites are the active centers for the PDH reaction, with catalyst reactivity independent of the Ga/Al ratio.

3. Schreiber et al. reported that Ga+H+ paired sites were more active than single Ga+ sites and the parent H-ZSM-5 catalyst, based on a combination of reactivity studies, quantitative pulse reactions, and DFT calculations.

These diverse findings highlight the ongoing debate and complexity surrounding the nature of active Ga species in Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts for PDH reactions, emphasizing the need for further research to fully understand and optimize these catalysts for industrial applications.

丙烯需求的增长显著影响了新生产方法的开发，特别是丙烷脱氢(PDH)。这是由于丙烯供需之间的差距不断扩大，主要是因为化学工业中天然气作为原料的使用增加。PDH已经成为丙烯生产的一种有前景的替代方法，目前已有两种商业化工艺：使用CrOx/Al2O3催化剂的Catofin工艺和使用Pt基催化剂的Oleflex工艺。

然而，由于Pt的高成本以及与Cr相关的健康和环境问题，推动了对替代PDH催化剂的研究。在这些替代催化剂中，Ga/H-ZSM-5被认为是烷烃脱氢和脱氢芳构化的高效催化剂。尽管经过几十年的研究，对Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂在PDH中的理解仍在不断发展，关于Ga物种、催化活性位点的本质和反应机理仍存在争议。

研究人员采用了各种实验技术来探究Ga/H-ZSM-5中的Ga物种和识别PDH反应中的活性位点。这些技术包括原位Ga K边X射线吸收近边结构(XANES)、非原位FTIR和NH3程序升温脱附(NH3-TPD)。近期的研究发现对我们目前对这些催化剂的认知做出了重要贡献：

1. Hensen及其同事使用DRIFTS在还原的Ga/H-ZSM-5上识别出Ga单氢化物和双氢化物物种，表明这些物种可能在PDH中起活性作用。

2. Phadke等人提出单一的[GaH]2+位点是PDH反应的活性中心，催化剂活性与Ga/Al比无关。

3. Schreiber等人基于反应活性研究、定量脉冲反应和DFT计算的组合，报告了Ga+H+配对位点比单一Ga+位点和母体H-ZSM-5催化剂更活跃。

这些不同的研究发现突显了关于Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂中活性Ga物种本质的持续争论和复杂性，强调了需要进一步研究以充分理解和优化这些催化剂用于工业应用。
