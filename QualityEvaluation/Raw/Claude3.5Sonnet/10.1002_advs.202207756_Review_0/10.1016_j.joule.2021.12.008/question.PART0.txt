Main text
The utilization of light alkanes to generate value-added chemicals has gained significant attention due to the U.S. shale gas boom in recent decades.
1
For example, after methane, ethane (316 vol.%) and propane (up to 5 vol.%) are the most abundant hydrocarbon species in shale gas deposits.
2
These inexpensive, widely available, but often underutilized, light alkanes can be used as a feedstock to produce olefins, which are among the most important petrochemical building blocks in chemical industry.
3
Ethylene and propylene are used in the production of polymers (e.g., polyethylene, polypropylene) and epoxides (e.g., ethylene oxide, propylene oxide), as well as intermediates in the manufacture of numerous other chemicals (e.g., ethylene glycol, ethylbenzene, acetone, isopropanol, and acrylonitrile).
At present, thermal steam cracking is the most mature industrial process to produce light olefins, which is highly energy-intensive and a significant emitter of carbon dioxide (CO2).
4
Therefore, more sustainable methods of olefin production with lower energy consumption and reduced CO2 emissions are of great interest. The non-oxidative direct dehydrogenation (DDH) of alkanes is able to produce olefins at lower process temperatures than that of steam cracking (usually above 1073 K).
5
Oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) has also been studied as an alternative to the high-temperature steam cracking process. Using O2 as the oxidant (O2-ODH) results in an exothermic reaction and significantly reduces the operating temperatures.
6
However, the presence of O2 as a co-reactant also facilitates deep oxidation to carbon oxides (i.e., CO and CO2), thus lowering olefin product selectivity. Alternatively, CO2 can be used as a soft oxidant for ODH (CO2-ODH). Although CO2-ODH is an overall endothermic reaction, CO2 is consumed as a co-reactant in CO2-ODH as opposed to being generated in O2-ODH.
In this commentary, we perform a thermodynamic comparison of the DDH, O2-ODH, and CO2-ODH processes. Equilibrium conversions, selectivities, and yields are calculated with the inclusion and exclusion of competing reactions in order to obtain upper and lower limits for catalytic performance. Then, we compare the overall net CO2 of the processes on a molar basis and determine whether it is possible to achieve net negative CO2 emissions for CO2-assisted dehydrogenation of light alkanes.
Analysis and discussion of ethane dehydrogenation
Equilibrium analysis
Equilibrium calculations were carried out in Aspen Plus V8.8; details are provided in the
supplemental information
.
Figure 1
shows equilibrium ethane conversions, ethylene selectivities (on an ethane-basis), and ethylene yields for several processes calculated from the Aspen REQUIL model. In the cases of DDH of ethane (DDHE) and CO2-ODH of ethane (CO2-ODHE), the ethane conversion generally increases when competing reactions to undesired products (i.e., hydrogenolysis and dry reforming) are included. For O2-ODH of ethane (O2-ODHE), the opposite trend is observed, with ethane conversion instead decreasing significantly with the inclusion of the competing combustion reactions.

(B) Ethylene selectivity.
(C) Ethylene yield.
As expected, the ethane-based selectivity to ethylene is 100% for DDHE, O2-ODHE, and CO2-ODHE when the competing reactions are excluded. However, the ethylene selectivity drops dramatically when the undesired reactions are considered, particularly for O2-ODHE and CO2-ODHE. This highlights the importance of identifying selective catalysts to promote CH bond cleavage for ethane dehydrogenation over the undesired CC dissociation pathways. The ethylene yields (
Figure 1
C) are generally enhanced without the presence of the competing reactions, as expected. When comparing the three optimal cases (i.e., without competing reactions), the equilibrium ethylene yield follows the trend of O2-ODHE > CO2-ODHE > DDHE, illustrating the potential of oxidative-assisted dehydrogenation.
Net CO2 consumption and production
Rising atmospheric CO2 concentrations have led to increases in global mean temperatures and detrimental effects to Earths ecosystems. Ultimately, the goal for any large-scale ethylene production process is to achieve net neutral or net negative CO2 emissions. At a minimum, any new process should emit less CO2 than the existing process that it replaces. CO2 emissions may originate directly as a byproduct from the reaction itself or indirectly due to the sources of its energy input.
In this analysis, net CO2 emissions were estimated based on the mass balances and energy requirements of the equilibrium processes discussed in
Figure 1
. Calculations were performed on a laboratory-scale since neither DDHE nor ODHE are commercialized processes at present, and therefore we do not have parameters for reliable industrial-scale process simulation. Sample laboratory-scale CO2-ODHE experimental results were taken from the literature as a point of comparison to equilibrium data, using the results by Xie et al.

Figure 2
compares the calculated net CO2 (
Figure 2
A: moles of CO2 per mole of ethylene produced;
Figure 2
B: moles of CO2 per mole of ethane converted) for all the equilibrium cases, as well as the experimental CO2-ODHE case as a function of CO2 emissions per unit energy. The values above and below zero in the y axis indicate net positive and net negative CO2 emissions, respectively. The x axis value shifts toward more renewable energy sources as it moves right, with the rightmost value at 0 kg of CO2 per kWh representing completely carbon-free energy production. Each equilibrium case is analyzed with and without their respective competing reactions. For example, the shaded blue region represents the boundaries of the DDHE cases with and without the competing hydrogenolysis reaction. Similarly, the lower green line represents O2-ODHE without combustion and 100% selectivity to ethylene, whereas the upper line includes the combustion reactions and therefore shows large net positive CO2 emissions. Since O2-ODHE is an exothermic process, the required heat input can be provided by the reaction itself, so minimal external energy is required. This is why the O2-ODHE lines are horizontal and the net CO2 emissions are essentially independent of the energy source. In contrast, the lower line for CO2-ODHE represents the case with the competing dry reforming reaction. By including the dry reforming reaction, more CO2 is consumed, although it is primarily toward generating syngas as opposed to ethylene. The steep slope of the lower line also illustrates the large energy requirement to produce 1 mole of ethylene and, thus, greater dependency on the CO2 emissions from the energy source.

(B) Net CO2 emissions per mole of ethane converted. Shaded regions represent the area between the equilibrium cases with and without their respective competing reactions. Values above and below zero on the y axis are net-CO2 emitting and net-CO2 consuming, respectively. All calculations are performed with the same ethane feed flow rate (10 mL min1) and reaction temperature (873 K).
The pink lines in

represent the experimental lab-scale CO2-ODHE results that are used for simulation with the Aspen RSTOIC model. In
Figure 2
A, at the average U.S. grid electricity emissions of 0.417 kg of CO2 per kWh,
8
the experimental CO2-ODHE results show higher net CO2 emissions (per mole of ethylene produced) than that of the DDHE equilibrium region. It is expected that the emissions per unit energy will reduce over time, as renewable sources gradually make up a larger portion of the U.S. energy mix. As cleaner energy sources are utilized, there is a crossover point around 0.160.22 kg of CO2 per kWh where experimental CO2-ODHE has lower net CO2 emissions than the DDHE equilibrium. Below 0.14 kg of CO2 per kWh, experimental CO2-ODHE also emits less than the ideal O2-ODHE case and achieves net negative CO2 emissions. With completely carbon-free energy sources (0 kg of CO2 per kWh), the experimental CO2-ODHE consumes 1.5 moles of CO2 to produce 1 mole of ethylene (and 1.8 moles of CO). These results illustrate the potential of using CO2-ODHE to produce ethylene with net negative emissions, provided that low-carbon energy sources are used.
Figure 2
B depicts the net CO2 emissions per mole of ethane converted. The general trends in
Figure 2
B are similar to the ethylene-normalized results in
Figure 2
A, although the absolute values and crossover points are different. Similar to
Figure 2
A, the lower red line in
Figure 2
B also represents CO2-ODHE with the competing dry reforming reaction, illustrating the large amount of CO2 converted to CO relative to the amount of ethane converted. At completely carbon-free energy sources, the CO2-ODHE (with reforming) case consumes nearly 2 moles of CO2 per mole of ethane converted. With both methods of normalization (i.e., producing ethylene or converting ethane), CO2-ODHE is demonstrated to be the only process that can achieve net negative CO2 emissions. Similar comparisons were also made for the dehydrogenation of propane, as described in the
supplemental information

Challenges and opportunities
At present, the direct, O2-assisted, and CO2-assisted dehydrogenation of light alkanes are not commercialized processes. In order to assess the viability of these alternative alkane dehydrogenation processes, they must be compared to the existing commercial technologies. For example, as shown in
Figure 2
A, the industrial ethane steam cracking process typically emits about 1.01.2 tons of CO2/tons of ethylene (0.640.76 moles of CO2/moles of ethylene), and naphtha steam cracking emits about 1.82.0 tons of CO2/tons of ethylene (1.151.27 moles of CO2/moles of ethylene).
4
It is noted that these values also include emissions associated with the compression, recovery, and separation sections of the process, which were not quantified for the dehydrogenation processes in this study due to the lack of available reference data. Based on the calculated results in
Figure 2
, it will be difficult to displace conventional steam cracking processes without a significant shift toward low-carbon energy sources. It is important to note that conventional steam cracking itself would also benefit from reduced emissions if cleaner energy sources for heating and electricity are used. However, the steam cracking reaction alone, assuming zero emissions from fuel combustion or utilities, still emits 0.27 tons of CO2/tons of ethylene (0.17 moles of CO2/moles of ethylene).
Although direct dehydrogenation can be competitive with the use of nearly carbon-free energy sources, the oxidative dehydrogenation pathways appear to have much greater potential in reducing CO2 emissions. For example, a highly selective O2-ODH process that suppresses over-oxidation to CO2 can approach net neutral CO2 emissions. Although several catalysts have already been reported in the literature with >80% selectivity toward olefins,
9
extensive formation of CO and CO2 is often observed at higher alkane conversions. O2-ODH can also be more attractive with fully optimized heat integration by utilizing the exothermic reaction heat to displace energy from fossil fuel-based sources. More interestingly, this work shows that CO2-ODH can potentially produce olefins while being a net consumer of CO2. Thus, the development of CO2-ODH catalysts with improved ethylene and propylene yields will further improve the prospects of achieving net negative CO2 emissions.
Furthermore, as illustrated in
Figure 2
, a CO2-ODHE process complemented by a dry reforming contribution produces both ethylene and syngas, which would have greater net negative CO2 emissions. Therefore, it may be beneficial to use the CO2-ethane reaction as the feedstock source in tandem thermochemical processes. For example, the CO2-ethane derived products (i.e., C2H4, CO, H2, and H2O) can be directly used as the feed for a tandem aromatization reaction (e.g., 3C2H4  C6H6 + 3H2) to produce aromatics (e.g., benzene, toluene, and xylenes)
10
,
11
or for a downstream hydroformylation (e.g., C2H4 + CO + H2  CH3CH2CHO)
12
or hydrocarboxylation (e.g., C2H4 + CO + H2O  CH3CH2COOH) process to produce value-added oxygenates (e.g., aldehydes, alcohols, and carboxylic acids). The direct production of liquid aromatics and oxygenates can reduce the energy cost associated with product separation and minimize safety risks during the transportation/storage of flammable ethylene and toxic syngas. It is noted that an efficient stand-alone CO2-ODHE process is sufficient to provide C2H4 for a tandem aromatization process. In comparison, concerted ODHE and ethane dry reforming reactions, as well as side reactions (e.g., reverse water-gas shift and reverse Boudouard reactions), are necessary to achieve the desirable feede.g., a stoichiometric ratio of C2H4/CO/H2 (1:1:1)for a downstream hydroformylation process, posing additional challenges for tuning catalyst selectivity. Moreover, a tandem-reactor system is a compromise to bridge the thermodynamic gap between upstream and downstream reactions at different temperatures.
12
New reaction chemistries coupling thermo/electro/photo/plasma approaches are worthwhile to be explored to achieve a one-pot conversion at relatively low temperatures.
In summary, this commentary provides an initial feasibility study on the potential for CO2-ODH of light alkanes as a potentially sustainable olefin production method with net negative CO2 emissions. Present challenges and future opportunities are also highlighted for the simultaneous upgrading of CO2 and light alkanes. We hope that the information provided here will stimulate more discoveries in efficient catalysts and catalytic processes to advance the practical application of CO2-assisted dehydrogenation of light alkanes.
