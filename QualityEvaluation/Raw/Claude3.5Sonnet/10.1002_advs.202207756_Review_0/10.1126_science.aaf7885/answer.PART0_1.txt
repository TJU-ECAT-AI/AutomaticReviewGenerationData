[1] "While propene is conventionally produced via steam cracking of large hydrocarbons in naphtha, the more recent trend to use shale gas as feeds to steam cracker units greatly increases the availability of low-cost ethene but also results in a gap between demand and supply of propene, as well as other higher olefins (2, 3). This disparity motivates the exploration of on-purpose propene technologies."

[2] "Despite non-oxidative propane dehydrogenation being the emerging technology used today, ODHP has the potential to improve reaction efficiency over its non-oxidative counterpart because of favorable thermodynamics (exothermic, lower reaction temperatures) and enhanced catalyst stability (prevention of coke deposition on the catalyst surface)."

The growing demand for propylene has led to the exploration of on-purpose propene technologies. This is due to a gap between supply and demand created by the recent trend of using shale gas in steam cracker units, which increases the availability of low-cost ethene but reduces propene production. 

Non-oxidative propane dehydrogenation (PDH) has emerged as a technology to address this gap. However, oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) is being researched as a potentially more efficient alternative due to its favorable thermodynamics and enhanced catalyst stability.

The literature does not provide specific information about Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts for PDH or recent research findings related to these catalysts. Therefore, the part of the question about the evolution of understanding Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts, the debate about active Ga species, and recent research findings cannot be answered based on the given information.

丙烯需求的增长导致了对专门生产丙烯技术的探索。这是由于最近在蒸汽裂解装置中使用页岩气的趋势造成的供需差距，这增加了低成本乙烯的供应，但减少了丙烯的产量。

非氧化丙烷脱氢(PDH)已经成为解决这一差距的一种技术。然而，由于氧化丙烷脱氢(ODHP)具有有利的热力学特性和增强的催化剂稳定性，正在被研究作为一种潜在的更高效替代方案。

文献中没有提供关于Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂用于PDH的具体信息，也没有提供与这些催化剂相关的最新研究发现。因此，关于Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂理解的演变、活性Ga物种的争论以及最新研究发现的问题部分无法根据给定信息回答。
