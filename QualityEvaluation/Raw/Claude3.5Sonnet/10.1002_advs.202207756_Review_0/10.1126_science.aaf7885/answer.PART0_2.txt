[1] "While propene is conventionally produced via steam cracking of large hydrocarbons in naphtha, the more recent trend to use shale gas as feeds to steam cracker units greatly increases the availability of low-cost ethene but also results in a gap between demand and supply of propene, as well as other higher olefins (2, 3). This disparity motivates the exploration of on-purpose propene technologies."

[2] "Despite non-oxidative propane dehydrogenation being the emerging technology used today, ODHP has the potential to improve reaction efficiency over its non-oxidative counterpart because of favorable thermodynamics (exothermic, lower reaction temperatures) and enhanced catalyst stability (prevention of coke deposition on the catalyst surface)."

The growing demand for propylene has influenced the development of new production methods, particularly propane dehydrogenation (PDH), due to a gap between propylene supply and demand created by the increased use of shale gas in steam cracking. This has motivated the exploration of on-purpose propylene technologies. While non-oxidative PDH is currently the emerging technology, oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) shows potential for improved reaction efficiency due to favorable thermodynamics and enhanced catalyst stability.

The literature does not provide specific information about the evolution of understanding Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts for PDH, the debate about active Ga species, or recent research findings related to these catalysts. The document focuses on boron nitride catalysts for ODHP rather than Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts for PDH.

丙烯需求的增长推动了新生产方法的发展，特别是丙烷脱氢（PDH），这是由于页岩气在蒸汽裂解中的广泛使用造成了丙烯供需缺口。这促使人们探索专门的丙烯生产技术。虽然非氧化PDH目前是新兴技术，但由于热力学有利条件和催化剂稳定性增强，丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）显示出提高反应效率的潜力。

文献中没有提供关于Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂在PDH中的理解演变、活性Ga物种的争论或与这些催化剂相关的最新研究发现的具体信息。该文档主要关注ODHP的氮化硼催化剂，而不是PDH的Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂。
