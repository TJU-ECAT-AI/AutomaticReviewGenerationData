[1] "While propene is conventionally produced via steam cracking of large hydrocarbons in naphtha, the more recent trend to use shale gas as feeds to steam cracker units greatly increases the availability of low-cost ethene but also results in a gap between demand and supply of propene, as well as other higher olefins (2, 3). This disparity motivates the exploration of on-purpose propene technologies."

[2] "Despite non-oxidative propane dehydrogenation being the emerging technology used today, ODHP has the potential to improve reaction efficiency over its non-oxidative counterpart because of favorable thermodynamics (exothermic, lower reaction temperatures) and enhanced catalyst stability (prevention of coke deposition on the catalyst surface)."

The growing demand for propylene has influenced the development of new production methods, particularly on-purpose propene technologies like propane dehydrogenation (PDH). This shift has been driven by changes in feedstock availability, with increased use of shale gas leading to a gap between propene supply and demand. While non-oxidative PDH is currently the emerging technology, oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) shows potential for improved reaction efficiency and catalyst stability.

The literature does not provide information about Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts for PDH, the debate about active Ga species, or recent research findings related to these catalysts. The focus of the given text is on boron nitride catalysts for ODHP rather than Ga-based catalysts for PDH.

丙烯需求的增长推动了新生产方法的发展，特别是定向丙烯技术，如丙烷脱氢(PDH)。这种转变是由原料供应的变化驱动的，页岩气的增加使用导致了丙烯供需之间的差距。虽然非氧化PDH目前是新兴技术，但丙烷的氧化脱氢(ODHP)显示出提高反应效率和催化剂稳定性的潜力。

文献中没有提供关于Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂用于PDH的信息，也没有涉及活性Ga物种的争论，或与这些催化剂相关的最新研究发现。给出的文本主要集中在用于ODHP的氮化硼催化剂，而不是用于PDH的Ga基催化剂。
