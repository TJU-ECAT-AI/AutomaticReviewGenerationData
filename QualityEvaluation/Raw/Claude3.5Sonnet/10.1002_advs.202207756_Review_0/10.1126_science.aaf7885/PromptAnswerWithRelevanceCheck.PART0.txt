How has the growing demand for propylene influenced the development of new production methods, particularly propane dehydrogenation (PDH), and how has the understanding of Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts for PDH evolved, including the ongoing debate about active Ga species and recent research findings that have contributed to our current knowledge of these catalysts?

[1] "While propene is conventionally produced via steam cracking of large hydrocarbons in naphtha, the more recent trend to use shale gas as feeds to steam cracker units greatly increases the availability of low-cost ethene but also results in a gap between demand and supply of propene, as well as other higher olefins (2, 3). This disparity motivates the exploration of on-purpose propene technologies."

[2] "Despite non-oxidative propane dehydrogenation being the emerging technology used today, ODHP has the potential to improve reaction efficiency over its non-oxidative counterpart because of favorable thermodynamics (exothermic, lower reaction temperatures) and enhanced catalyst stability (prevention of coke deposition on the catalyst surface)."

The growing demand for propylene has led to the exploration of on-purpose propene technologies, particularly propane dehydrogenation (PDH). This development has been driven by the recent trend of using shale gas in steam cracker units, which has increased the availability of low-cost ethene but created a gap between the demand and supply of propene and other higher olefins.

While non-oxidative propane dehydrogenation is currently the emerging technology, oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) shows potential for improved reaction efficiency due to favorable thermodynamics and enhanced catalyst stability. ODHP offers advantages such as lower reaction temperatures and prevention of coke deposition on the catalyst surface.

The literature does not provide specific information about Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts for PDH, the debate about active Ga species, or recent research findings related to these catalysts. The focus of the given text is primarily on boron nitride catalysts for ODHP rather than Ga-based catalysts for PDH.

丙烯需求的增长推动了定向丙烯生产技术的探索，特别是丙烷脱氢(PDH)技术。这一发展趋势是由于最近在蒸汽裂解装置中使用页岩气的趋势，这增加了低成本乙烯的供应，但也造成了丙烯和其他高级烯烃的供需差距。

虽然非氧化丙烷脱氢目前是新兴技术，但丙烷氧化脱氢(ODHP)由于其有利的热力学特性和增强的催化剂稳定性，显示出提高反应效率的潜力。ODHP的优势包括较低的反应温度和防止催化剂表面结焦。

文献中没有提供关于Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂用于PDH的具体信息，也没有涉及活性Ga物种的争论或与这些催化剂相关的最新研究发现。给出的文本主要集中在用于ODHP的氮化硼催化剂，而不是用于PDH的Ga基催化剂。

The growing demand for propylene has led to the exploration of on-purpose propene technologies. This is due to a gap between supply and demand created by the recent trend of using shale gas in steam cracker units, which increases the availability of low-cost ethene but reduces propene production. 

Non-oxidative propane dehydrogenation (PDH) has emerged as a technology to address this gap. However, oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) is being researched as a potentially more efficient alternative due to its favorable thermodynamics and enhanced catalyst stability.

The literature does not provide specific information about Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts for PDH or recent research findings related to these catalysts. Therefore, the part of the question about the evolution of understanding Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts, the debate about active Ga species, and recent research findings cannot be answered based on the given information.

丙烯需求的增长导致了对专门生产丙烯技术的探索。这是由于最近在蒸汽裂解装置中使用页岩气的趋势造成的供需差距，这增加了低成本乙烯的供应，但减少了丙烯的产量。

非氧化丙烷脱氢(PDH)已经成为解决这一差距的一种技术。然而，由于氧化丙烷脱氢(ODHP)具有有利的热力学特性和增强的催化剂稳定性，正在被研究作为一种潜在的更高效替代方案。

文献中没有提供关于Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂用于PDH的具体信息，也没有提供与这些催化剂相关的最新研究发现。因此，关于Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂理解的演变、活性Ga物种的争论以及最新研究发现的问题部分无法根据给定信息回答。

The growing demand for propylene has influenced the development of new production methods, particularly on-purpose propene technologies like propane dehydrogenation (PDH). This shift has been driven by changes in feedstock availability, with increased use of shale gas for steam cracking resulting in a gap between propylene supply and demand. While non-oxidative propane dehydrogenation is currently the emerging technology, oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) shows potential for improved efficiency due to favorable thermodynamics and enhanced catalyst stability.

The literature does not provide information specifically about Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts for PDH or the debate about active Ga species. Therefore, the question about the evolution of understanding these catalysts and recent research findings cannot be answered based on the given text.
