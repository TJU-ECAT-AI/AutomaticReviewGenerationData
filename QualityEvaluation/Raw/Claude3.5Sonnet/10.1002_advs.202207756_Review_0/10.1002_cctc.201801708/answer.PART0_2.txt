[1] "Propylene is a vital building block in petrochemical industry, which can synthesize numerous high-valued chemical products such as polypropylene, acrylic acid, acrylonitrile and so on."

[2] "Due to the rich source of propane and the great price gap between propane and propylene, direct dehydrogenation of propane to propylene (PDH) has been regarded as one of the most effective ways."

[3] "The traditional catalysts of PDH reaction are Pt and CrOx based catalysts, while the former is costly and the latter is noxious. Moreover, both of them are prone to deactivate in a very short time. Thus, the exploit of alternative catalyst systems is of great importance."

The growing demand for propylene has led to the development of new production methods, particularly propane dehydrogenation (PDH). This is due to propylene's importance as a vital building block in the petrochemical industry for synthesizing high-value products. PDH has become one of the most effective ways to produce propylene because of the abundant propane sources and the significant price difference between propane and propylene.

Traditional PDH catalysts like Pt and CrOx have limitations such as high cost, toxicity, and rapid deactivation. These drawbacks have driven the search for alternative catalyst systems. However, the literature provided does not contain specific information about Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts for PDH, their active Ga species, or recent research findings related to these catalysts. Therefore, the part of the question regarding the evolution of understanding Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts cannot be answered based on the given information.

由于丙烯在石油化工行业中作为合成高价值产品的重要原料，对丙烯的需求不断增长推动了新的生产方法的发展，特别是丙烷脱氢(PDH)。由于丙烷资源丰富且丙烷与丙烯之间存在较大的价格差异，PDH已成为生产丙烯最有效的方法之一。

传统的PDH催化剂如Pt和CrOx存在诸如高成本、毒性和快速失活等限制。这些缺点推动了对替代催化剂系统的研究。然而，所提供的文献中并未包含有关Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂用于PDH、其活性Ga物种或与这些催化剂相关的最新研究发现的具体信息。因此，基于给定的信息无法回答有关Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂理解演变的那部分问题。
