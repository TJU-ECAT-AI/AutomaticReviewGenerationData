[1] "Propylene is a vital building block in petrochemical industry, which can synthesize numerous high-valued chemical products such as polypropylene, acrylic acid, acrylonitrile and so on."

[2] "Due to the rich source of propane and the great price gap between propane and propylene, direct dehydrogenation of propane to propylene (PDH) has been regarded as one of the most effective ways."

[3] "The traditional catalysts of PDH reaction are Pt and CrOx based catalysts, while the former is costly and the latter is noxious. Moreover, both of them are prone to deactivate in a very short time. Thus, the exploit of alternative catalyst systems is of great importance."

The growing demand for propylene has influenced the development of new production methods, particularly propane dehydrogenation (PDH). PDH has become an important method for producing propylene due to the abundance of propane and the significant price difference between propane and propylene. This has led to increased research into alternative catalyst systems for PDH, as traditional catalysts like Pt and CrOx have drawbacks such as high cost, toxicity, and rapid deactivation.

However, the literature provided does not contain specific information about Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts for PDH or the evolution of understanding regarding these catalysts. There is no mention of ongoing debates about active Ga species or recent research findings related to Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts. The focus of the given text is primarily on ZnO nanoclusters supported on dealuminated zeolite β as a novel catalyst for PDH.

丙烯需求的增长推动了新生产方法的发展，特别是丙烷脱氢(PDH)。由于丙烷资源丰富以及丙烷和丙烯之间的巨大价格差异，PDH已成为生产丙烯的重要方法。这导致了对PDH替代催化剂系统的研究增加，因为传统的Pt和CrOx催化剂存在高成本、毒性和快速失活等缺点。

然而，所提供的文献中并没有包含关于Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂用于PDH的具体信息，也没有提到对这些催化剂理解的演变。文中没有提及关于活性Ga物种的持续争论或与Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂相关的最新研究发现。给出的文本主要集中在以脱铝沸石β为载体的ZnO纳米簇作为PDH新型催化剂的研究。
