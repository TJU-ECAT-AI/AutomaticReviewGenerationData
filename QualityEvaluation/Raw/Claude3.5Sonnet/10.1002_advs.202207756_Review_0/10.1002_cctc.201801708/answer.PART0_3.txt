[1] "Propylene is a vital building block in petrochemical industry, which can synthesize numerous high-valued chemical products such as polypropylene, acrylic acid, acrylonitrile and so on."

[2] "Due to the rich source of propane and the great price gap between propane and propylene, direct dehydrogenation of propane to propylene (PDH) has been regarded as one of the most effective ways."

The growing demand for propylene has led to the development of propane dehydrogenation (PDH) as an effective production method. This is due to the abundance of propane and the significant price difference between propane and propylene. PDH has emerged as a promising alternative to traditional production methods like steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking, which cannot meet the increasing market demand for propylene.

However, the literature does not provide specific information about the evolution of understanding Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts for PDH or the ongoing debate about active Ga species. The document focuses on zinc-based catalysts supported on dealuminated β zeolite rather than gallium-based catalysts. Therefore, the question cannot be fully answered based on the given information.

丙烯需求的增长推动了丙烷脱氢(PDH)作为一种有效生产方法的发展。这是由于丙烷资源丰富以及丙烷和丙烯之间存在显著的价格差异。PDH已成为传统生产方法(如蒸汽裂解和流化催化裂解)的一个有前景的替代方案，因为这些传统方法无法满足日益增长的丙烯市场需求。

然而，文献中并未提供关于Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂在PDH中的理解演变或活性Ga物种的持续争论的具体信息。该文档主要关注以脱铝β沸石为载体的锌基催化剂，而非镓基催化剂。因此，基于给定的信息无法完整回答这个问题。
