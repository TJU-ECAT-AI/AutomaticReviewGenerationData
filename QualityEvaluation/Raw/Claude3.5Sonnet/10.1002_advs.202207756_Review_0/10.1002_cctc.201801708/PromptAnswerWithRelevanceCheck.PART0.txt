<quotes>

[1] "Propylene is a vital building block in petrochemical industry, which can synthesize numerous high-valued chemical products such as polypropylene, acrylic acid, acrylonitrile and so on."

[2] "Due to the rich source of propane and the great price gap between propane and propylene, direct dehydrogenation of propane to propylene (PDH) has been regarded as one of the most effective ways."

[3] "The traditional catalysts of PDH reaction are Pt and CrOx based catalysts, while the former is costly and the latter is noxious. Moreover, both of them are prone to deactivate in a very short time. Thus, the exploit of alternative catalyst systems is of great importance."

</quotes>

The growing demand for propylene has led to the development of new production methods, particularly propane dehydrogenation (PDH). This is due to several factors:

1. Propylene's importance as a vital building block in the petrochemical industry for producing high-value products.

2. The abundance of propane as a raw material.

3. The significant price difference between propane and propylene.

4. Limitations of traditional production methods like steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking.

PDH has emerged as one of the most effective ways to produce propylene. However, traditional PDH catalysts based on Pt and CrOx have drawbacks such as high cost, toxicity, and rapid deactivation. This has driven research into alternative catalyst systems.

The literature does not provide specific information about the evolution of understanding Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts for PDH or the debate about active Ga species. The focus of the given text is on zinc-based catalysts supported on dealuminated β zeolite, rather than Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts.

丙烯需求的增长推动了新生产方法的发展，特别是丙烷脱氢(PDH)。这是由于几个因素：

1. 丙烯作为石油化工行业生产高附加值产品的重要原料。

2. 丙烷作为原料的丰富性。

3. 丙烷和丙烯之间显著的价格差异。

4. 传统生产方法如蒸汽裂解和流化催化裂解的局限性。

PDH已成为生产丙烯最有效的方法之一。然而，传统的基于Pt和CrOx的PDH催化剂存在成本高、毒性和快速失活等缺点。这推动了对替代催化剂系统的研究。

文献中没有提供关于Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂用于PDH的理解演变或活性Ga物种争论的具体信息。给定文本的重点是支持在脱铝β沸石上的锌基催化剂，而非Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂。

The growing demand for propylene has led to the development of new production methods, particularly propane dehydrogenation (PDH). This is due to propylene's importance as a vital building block in the petrochemical industry for synthesizing high-value products. PDH has become one of the most effective ways to produce propylene because of the abundant source of propane and the significant price difference between propane and propylene.

Traditional PDH catalysts like Pt and CrOx have limitations - Pt is expensive, and CrOx is toxic. Both also deactivate quickly. This has driven the search for alternative catalyst systems.

The literature does not provide specific information about the evolution of understanding Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts for PDH or the debate about active Ga species. The document focuses on zinc-based catalysts supported on dealuminated beta zeolite rather than gallium-based catalysts.

由于丙烯在石油化工行业中作为合成高价值产品的重要建筑块，对丙烯日益增长的需求推动了新生产方法的发展，特别是丙烷脱氢(PDH)。由于丙烷来源丰富且丙烷和丙烯之间存在巨大的价格差距，PDH已成为生产丙烯最有效的方法之一。

传统的PDH催化剂如Pt和CrOx存在局限性 - Pt昂贵，而CrOx有毒。两者都容易快速失活。这推动了对替代催化剂系统的研究。

文献中没有提供关于Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂在PDH中的理解演变或活性Ga物种争论的具体信息。该文档主要关注支持在脱铝β沸石上的锌基催化剂，而不是镓基催化剂。

The growing demand for propylene has led to the development of propane dehydrogenation (PDH) as an effective production method. This is due to the abundance of propane and the significant price difference between propane and propylene. PDH has emerged as a promising alternative to traditional production methods like steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking, which cannot meet the increasing market demand for propylene.

However, the literature does not provide specific information about the evolution of understanding Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts for PDH or the ongoing debate about active Ga species. The document focuses on zinc-based catalysts supported on dealuminated β zeolite rather than gallium-based catalysts. Therefore, the question cannot be fully answered based on the given information.
