[1] "Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) is an industrial technology for direct propylene production, which has received extensive attention and realized large-scale application."

[2] "At present, the commercial Pt/Cr-based catalysts suffer from fast deactivation and inferior stability resulting from active species sintering and coke depositing."

[3] "To overcome the above problems, several strategies such as the modification of the support and the introduction of additives have been proposed to strengthen the catalytic performance and prolong the robust stability of Pt/Cr-based catalysts."

The literature does not provide specific information about the growing demand for propylene or the development of Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts for PDH. It only mentions that propane dehydrogenation (PDH) has gained significant attention and has been implemented on a large scale for direct propylene production. The text focuses on Pt/Cr-based catalysts, noting their issues with fast deactivation and poor stability due to sintering and coke formation. To address these problems, researchers have explored modifying supports and introducing additives to improve catalytic performance and stability. However, the document does not discuss Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts or the debate about active Ga species.

这篇文献没有提供关于丙烯需求增长或Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂用于丙烷脱氢(PDH)发展的具体信息。它只提到丙烷脱氢(PDH)已经受到广泛关注，并已在直接生产丙烯方面实现了大规模应用。文本主要关注Pt/Cr基催化剂，指出它们由于烧结和积碳而存在快速失活和稳定性差的问题。为解决这些问题，研究人员已经探索了改性载体和引入添加剂等策略，以提高催化性能和稳定性。然而，该文档并未讨论Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂或关于活性Ga物种的争论。
