          [1] "Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) is an industrial technology for direct propylene production, which has received extensive attention and realized large-scale application."

          [2] "At present, the commercial Pt/Cr-based catalysts suffer from fast deactivation and inferior stability resulting from active species sintering and coke depositing."

          [3] "To overcome the above problems, several strategies such as the modification of the support and the introduction of additives have been proposed to strengthen the catalytic performance and prolong the robust stability of Pt/Cr-based catalysts."

          The provided literature does not contain specific information about the growing demand for propylene or the development of Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts for PDH. It mentions that propane dehydrogenation (PDH) is an industrial technology for direct propylene production that has gained extensive attention and achieved large-scale application. The text focuses on Pt/Cr-based catalysts, noting their issues with fast deactivation and poor stability due to sintering and coke formation. To address these problems, researchers have explored modifying supports and introducing additives to improve catalytic performance and stability. However, the document does not discuss Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts, the debate about active Ga species, or recent research findings related to these catalysts.

          所提供的文献没有包含关于丙烯需求增长或Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂用于PDH发展的具体信息。文中提到丙烷脱氢(PDH)是一种直接生产丙烯的工业技术，已经受到广泛关注并实现了大规模应用。文本主要关注Pt/Cr基催化剂，指出它们由于烧结和积碳而存在快速失活和稳定性差的问题。为解决这些问题，研究人员已经探索了改性载体和引入添加剂等策略，以提高催化性能和稳定性。然而，该文档并未讨论Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂、活性Ga物种的争论或与这些催化剂相关的最新研究发现。
