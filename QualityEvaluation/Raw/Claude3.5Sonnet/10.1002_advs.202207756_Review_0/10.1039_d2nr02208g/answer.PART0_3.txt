The given literature does not contain information specifically addressing the growing demand for propylene, the development of new production methods like propane dehydrogenation (PDH), or the evolution of understanding regarding Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts for PDH. The text appears to focus on Pt/Cr-based catalysts for PDH and does not mention Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts or discuss the debate about active Ga species. Therefore, this question cannot be answered based on the provided document.

给定的文献中没有具体涉及丙烯需求增长、新生产方法(如丙烷脱氢PDH)的发展,或关于PDH用Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂认识的演变等信息。该文本似乎主要关注PDH的Pt/Cr基催化剂,并未提及Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂或讨论活性Ga物种的争论。因此,无法根据所提供的文档回答这个问题。
