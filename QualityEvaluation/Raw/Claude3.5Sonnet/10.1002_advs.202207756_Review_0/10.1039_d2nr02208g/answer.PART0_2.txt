<EnglishVersionAnswer>

The given literature does not contain information specifically addressing the growing demand for propylene, the development of new production methods like propane dehydrogenation (PDH), or the evolution of understanding regarding Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts for PDH. The text appears to be primarily about Pt/Cr-based catalysts for PDH and does not mention Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts or provide details about the growing demand for propylene. Therefore, this question cannot be accurately answered based solely on the provided literature.

<ChineseVersionAnswer>

给定的文献中没有具体涉及丙烯需求增长、新生产方法(如丙烷脱氢(PDH))的发展,或关于PDH用Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂理解的演变等信息。文本主要讨论了PDH用Pt/Cr基催化剂,没有提到Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂或提供有关丙烯需求增长的细节。因此,仅基于所提供的文献无法准确回答这个问题。
