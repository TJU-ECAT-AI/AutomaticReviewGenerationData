[1] "Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) is an industrial technology for direct propylene production, which has received extensive attention and realized large-scale application."

[2] "At present, the commercial Pt/Cr-based catalysts suffer from fast deactivation and inferior stability resulting from active species sintering and coke depositing."

[3] "To overcome the above problems, several strategies such as the modification of the support and the introduction of additives have been proposed to strengthen the catalytic performance and prolong the robust stability of Pt/Cr-based catalysts."

The literature does not provide specific information about the growing demand for propylene or the development of Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts for PDH. The text mentions that propane dehydrogenation (PDH) is an industrial technology for direct propylene production that has gained extensive attention and achieved large-scale application. It discusses challenges with current commercial Pt/Cr-based catalysts, including fast deactivation and poor stability due to active species sintering and coke deposition. To address these issues, researchers have proposed strategies such as modifying supports and introducing additives to improve catalytic performance and stability. However, the document does not contain information about Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts or the debate surrounding active Ga species in PDH catalysts.

这篇文献没有提供关于丙烯需求增长或Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂用于PDH的具体信息。文中提到丙烷脱氢(PDH)是一种直接生产丙烯的工业技术，已经受到广泛关注并实现了大规模应用。文章讨论了当前商业化Pt/Cr基催化剂面临的挑战，包括由于活性物种烧结和积碳导致的快速失活和稳定性差等问题。为解决这些问题，研究人员提出了一些策略，如改性载体和引入添加剂，以提高催化性能和稳定性。然而，该文档并未包含有关Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂或PDH催化剂中活性Ga物种争论的信息。
