[1] "Propylene is one of the most important building blocks for producing a wide variety of chemicals such as propylene oxide, acrylonitrile, and so on. With the consumption of fossil energy, the conventional propylene production process such as naphtha steam cracking can no longer meet the growing demands. The direct propane dehydrogenation (PDH) to produce propylene is thus attracting much attention due to the relatively abundant feedstock and less by-products."

[2] "To date, the Oleflex process with PtSn/Al2O3 catalyst and the Catofin process with Cr/Al2O3 catalyst are the most widely used technologies for the industrial PDH reaction. However, the high cost of Pt and serious pollution issues of Cr(VI) greatly restrict the further development."

[3] "Among developed alternatives, cobalt-based catalysts have attracted much attention due to its efficient CH activation ability and inexpensive, nontoxic characters."

The growing demand for propylene has led to the development of new production methods, particularly propane dehydrogenation (PDH). This shift is driven by the inability of conventional processes like naphtha steam cracking to meet increasing demands. PDH has gained attention due to its use of relatively abundant feedstock and fewer by-products.

Currently, the most widely used industrial PDH technologies are the Oleflex process (using PtSn/Al2O3 catalysts) and the Catofin process (using Cr/Al2O3 catalysts). However, these processes face limitations due to the high cost of platinum and pollution issues associated with chromium.

As a result, there has been increased interest in developing alternative catalysts. Cobalt-based catalysts have emerged as promising candidates due to their efficient C-H activation ability, low cost, and non-toxic nature.

The literature does not provide specific information about the evolution of understanding Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts for PDH or the ongoing debate about active Ga species. The focus of this document is primarily on cobalt-based catalysts rather than gallium-based ones.

丙烯需求的增长推动了新生产方法的发展，特别是丙烷脱氢(PDH)。这种转变是由于传统的生产工艺如石脑油蒸汽裂解无法满足不断增长的需求。PDH因其使用相对丰富的原料和较少的副产品而受到关注。

目前，工业上最广泛使用的PDH技术是Oleflex工艺(使用PtSn/Al2O3催化剂)和Catofin工艺(使用Cr/Al2O3催化剂)。然而，这些工艺面临着铂金成本高和铬污染问题的限制。

因此，开发替代催化剂的兴趣日益增加。钴基催化剂因其高效的C-H活化能力、低成本和无毒性而成为有前途的候选者。

文献中没有提供关于Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂在PDH中的理解演变或活性Ga物种的持续争论的具体信息。该文档主要关注钴基催化剂，而不是镓基催化剂。
