[1] "Propylene is one of the most important building blocks for producing a wide variety of chemicals such as propylene oxide, acrylonitrile, and so on. With the consumption of fossil energy, the conventional propylene production process such as naphtha steam cracking can no longer meet the growing demands."

[2] "The direct propane dehydrogenation (PDH) to produce propylene is thus attracting much attention due to the relatively abundant feedstock and less by-products."

[3] "To date, the Oleflex process with PtSn/Al2O3 catalyst and the Catofin process with Cr/Al2O3 catalyst are the most widely used technologies for the industrial PDH reaction. However, the high cost of Pt and serious pollution issues of Cr(VI) greatly restrict the further development."

[4] "Among developed alternatives, cobalt-based catalysts have attracted much attention due to its efficient CH activation ability and inexpensive, nontoxic characters."

The growing demand for propylene has led to the development of new production methods, particularly propane dehydrogenation (PDH). This is because conventional methods like naphtha steam cracking can no longer meet the increasing demand. PDH has gained attention due to its use of relatively abundant feedstock and production of fewer by-products.

Currently, the most widely used industrial PDH technologies are the Oleflex process using PtSn/Al2O3 catalysts and the Catofin process using Cr/Al2O3 catalysts. However, these processes face limitations due to the high cost of platinum and pollution issues associated with chromium.

As a result, there has been increased interest in developing alternative catalysts. Cobalt-based catalysts have emerged as promising alternatives due to their efficient C-H activation ability, low cost, and non-toxic nature.

The literature does not provide specific information about the evolution of understanding Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts for PDH or any ongoing debates about active Ga species. The focus of this document is primarily on cobalt-based catalysts rather than gallium-based ones.

丙烯需求的增长推动了新生产方法的发展，特别是丙烷脱氢（PDH）。这是因为传统方法如石脑油蒸汽裂解已无法满足不断增长的需求。PDH因其使用相对丰富的原料和产生较少的副产品而备受关注。

目前，最广泛使用的工业PDH技术是使用PtSn/Al2O3催化剂的Oleflex工艺和使用Cr/Al2O3催化剂的Catofin工艺。然而，这些工艺因铂金的高成本和铬相关的污染问题而受到限制。

因此，开发替代催化剂的兴趣日益增加。钴基催化剂因其高效的C-H活化能力、低成本和无毒性而成为有前景的替代品。

文献中没有提供关于Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂在PDH中理解演变的具体信息，也没有关于活性Ga物种的任何持续争论。本文档主要关注的是钴基催化剂，而不是镓基催化剂。
