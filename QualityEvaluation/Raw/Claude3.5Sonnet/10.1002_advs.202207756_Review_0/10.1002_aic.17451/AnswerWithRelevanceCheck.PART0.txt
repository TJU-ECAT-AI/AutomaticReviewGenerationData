          [1] "Propylene is one of the most important building blocks for producing a wide variety of chemicals such as propylene oxide, acrylonitrile, and so on. With the consumption of fossil energy, the conventional propylene production process such as naphtha steam cracking can no longer meet the growing demands. The direct propane dehydrogenation (PDH) to produce propylene is thus attracting much attention due to the relatively abundant feedstock and less by-products."

[2] "To date, the Oleflex process with PtSn/Al2O3 catalyst and the Catofin process with Cr/Al2O3 catalyst are the most widely used technologies for the industrial PDH reaction. However, the high cost of Pt and serious pollution issues of Cr(VI) greatly restrict the further development."

[3] "Among developed alternatives, cobalt-based catalysts have attracted much attention due to its efficient CH activation ability and inexpensive, nontoxic characters."

          The growing demand for propylene has led to the development of new production methods, particularly propane dehydrogenation (PDH). This shift is driven by the inability of conventional processes like naphtha steam cracking to meet increasing demands due to fossil energy consumption. PDH has gained attention because of its relatively abundant feedstock and fewer by-products compared to traditional methods.

Currently, the Oleflex process using PtSn/Al2O3 catalysts and the Catofin process using Cr/Al2O3 catalysts are the most widely used industrial PDH technologies. However, these processes face limitations due to the high cost of Pt and pollution issues associated with Cr(VI).

As a result, there has been increased interest in developing alternative catalysts, with cobalt-based catalysts attracting attention due to their efficient C-H activation ability and their inexpensive and non-toxic nature.

The provided information does not contain specific details about the evolution of understanding Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts for PDH or the ongoing debate about active Ga species. The focus is primarily on cobalt-based catalysts rather than gallium-based ones.

          丙烯需求的增长推动了新生产方法的发展，特别是丙烷脱氢(PDH)。这种转变是由于传统的石脑油蒸汽裂解等工艺因化石能源消耗而无法满足不断增长的需求。与传统方法相比，PDH因其相对丰富的原料和较少的副产品而受到关注。

目前，使用PtSn/Al2O3催化剂的Oleflex工艺和使用Cr/Al2O3催化剂的Catofin工艺是最广泛使用的工业PDH技术。然而，这些工艺因铂的高成本和六价铬相关的污染问题而面临限制。

因此，开发替代催化剂的兴趣日益增加，其中钴基催化剂因其高效的C-H活化能力以及廉价和无毒的特性而受到关注。

提供的信息中没有关于Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂在PDH中的理解演变或活性Ga物种的持续争论的具体细节。主要关注的是钴基催化剂，而非镓基催化剂。
