Co-based catalysts are promising alternatives to replace Pt- and Cr-based catalysts for propane dehydro-
genation (PDH) in view of the catalytic activity for CH bond activation, low cost, and low toxicity.
However, the reduction of unstable CoOx species and coke deposition cause serious catalyst deactivation.
In this work, a sheet-shaped CoAl2O3 catalyst comprising of isolate Co2+ sites shows a high intrinsic
activity (specific reaction rate > 16 mmol g1 h1) and catalytic stability in highly selective PDH reaction
(>97% C3H6 selectivity). Extensive characterization demonstrates that the tetrahedral Co2+ isolated site is
stabilized by the c-Al2O3 matrix, facilitating propylene desorption to inhibit formation of coke and other
byproducts and to free the active Co sites.

1. Introduction
Propylene is a key commodity chemical for the manufacture of
a wide variety of products such as polypropylene, propylene oxide,
acetone, acrylonitrile and acrolein [14]. The increasing global
demand of propylene and a large reserve of propane in shale-gas
deposits are drawing interests in employing catalytic propane
dehydrogenation (PDH) to produce propylene. The commercial
PDH processes are based on two kinds of primary technologies,
the Oleflex process with PtSn/Al2O3 catalyst and the Catofin pro-
cess with Cr/Al2O3 catalyst [5]. For Pt-based catalysts, the elec-
tronic modification by promoters and the specific interaction
with the optimized supports lead to the enhancement in both cat-
alytic activity and stability [611]. However, the high price of Pt
metal and the serious toxicity issue of Cr catalyst greatly restrict
the further development of the PDH process. Development of
cost-effective and environmentally friendly catalysts (e.g., Ga-,
Zn- or Sn-based candidates) remains as an important catalytic
challenge [1224].
Low-coordinate cobalt species (Co+/Co2+) are known to be effi-
cient in CH activation for hydrocarbons [25]. It has been reported
that the oxygen-deficient cobalt/oxygen cluster ions could accom-
plish the dehydrogenation of isobutane via the insertion into the
CH bond with formation of the [CoxOx-1C4H8]+ intermediates
[26]. The isotopic labelling kinetics of Co+-catalyzed CH and CC
activation of C3H8 show a remarkable dependence on the elec-
tronic state of Co+ cation adducts [27]. The activation of CH and
CC bonds and H2/CH4 elimination favored the Co+ with the
exited-state rather than with the ground-state [28]. Co2+ ion-
exchanged ZSM-5 zeolite catalyst is capable of C3H8 activation;
however it also reveals fast reaction rates of CC cracking path-
ways [29,30]. Nearly 80% propylene selectivity could be obtained
on a mesoporous CoAl2O4 spinel catalyst in the PDH reaction,
whereas the rapid deactivation was observed [31]. The optimal cat-
alytic performance of 21.5% C3H6 yield was achieved on a 5 wt% Co/
Al2O3 catalyst [32]. Nonetheless, the unsatisfactory C3H6 selectivity
of 83.6% indicated that the co-existence of the diverse Co active
sites on the surface of Al2O3 support that caused significant side
reactions. This is partly due to the lacking of structure-control on
the Co sites. Modified spinel Co3O4 has shown good activity in
the oxidative dehydrogenation of light alkanes, however, it can
be easily reduced to metallic Co0 species during the anaerobic
PDH
reaction,

significant methane and C2 molecules [33,34]. Therefore, exposure
of stabilized and active surface Co sites with a single state still
remain as a key challenge for facilitating both catalytic selectivity
and stability in Co-catalyzed PDH reaction [35].
Al2O3 is one of the most commonly used supports in heteroge-
neous catalysis due to its structural advantages and stability. For
instance, the coordinately unsaturated Al3+ sites present on the
(100) facets of commercial c-Al2O3 can serve as anchor sites to
anchor atomically dispersed Pt and Ru sites [36,37]. The specific
interaction between Ga2O3 and Al2O3 can allow the tetrahedral
Ga3+ cations to highly disperse in the spinel-type c-Ga2O3-Al2O3
solid solution, leading to an enhanced activity and stability in
PDH reaction [38]. The c-Al2O3 nanosheet containing 27% penta-
coordinated Al3+ sites has been proved that it could nicely disperse
and stabilize bimetallic PtSn nanoclusters because of the strong
interactions between metals and support [39]. This PtSn/Al2O3
sheet catalyst displayed an excellent performance at an ultrahigh
space velocity in a long-term PDH reaction. In addition to being
an appropriate support, the hydroxyl groups-eliminated Al2O3
showed a high activity of coordinately unsaturated Al3+ as the sur-
face active sites in non-oxidative dehydrogenation of isobutane to
isobutylene [40]. Furthermore, the diversity and complexity on the
structure of Al2O3, for example the surface acidity at the low-
coordinated Al sites, determined the different properties in the
adsorption and the activation of propane as well as coke deposition
in the PDH reaction. It is therefore desirable to tailor the structure
of Co2+ and Al2O3 composites for improving the catalytic perfor-
mance in the PDH reaction.
Herein, a one-step hydrothermal method is employed to syn-
thesize sheet-shaped CoAl2O3HT catalysts for efficiently catalyz-
ing the PDH reaction. The structural and catalytic stabilities as well
as the CoAl2O3 interaction for these catalysts are benchmarked to
an impregnated Co/Al2O3-IMP catalyst. We further illustrate the
effect of C3H6 desorption behavior in the Co-catalyzed PDH
reaction.
2. Experimental
2.1. Catalyst preparation
The c-Al2O3 sheets were synthesized according to a previously
reported hydrothermal procedure with minor modifications. The
formation of the shaped boehmite (c-AlO(OH)) precursor with
the aid of urea is regard as the key to control the sheet-like mor-
phology of the resultant catalysts [41]. 6.44 g of Al(NO3)39H2O
and 9.4 g of urea (CO(NH2)2) were dissolved in 190 mL of deionized
water to form a homogeneous solution under vigorous stirring for
15 min. The solution with a pH of approximately 4 was transferred
into a Teflon-lined stainless autoclave and then maintained at
100 C for 48 h. After natural cooling, the white precipitate was fil-
tered and then washed with deionized water and anhydrous alco-
hol several times. The powder was dried at 100 C overnight and
calcined in air at 600 C for 2 h with a heating rate of 1 C/min
to obtain the c-Al2O3 sheets.
All CoAl2O3HT catalysts were prepared using the same
hydrothermal procedure except of the addition of Co precursor
salt. Urea was used as the precipitating agent and the certain molar
ratio of Co and Al was adjusted by changing the dosages of Co
(NO3)26H2O and Al(NO3)39H2O. Typically, the molar ratio of urea
to total metals (Co+Al) was approximately 9:1. The synthesis of
5 wt% Co/Al2O3-IMP catalyst as the reference catalyst was followed
the incipient wetness impregnation method. The diluted Co(NO3)2
solution was incipient impregnated into the c-Al2O3 sheet support.
The sample was maintained at room temperature for 2 h and then
dried at 70 C overnight. All the Co catalysts were finally obtained
by the calcination in air at 600 C for 4 h with a heating rate of 2 C/
min.
