[1] "Propylene is a key commodity chemical for the manufacture of a wide variety of products such as polypropylene, propylene oxide, acetone, acrylonitrile and acrolein [14]. The increasing global demand of propylene and a large reserve of propane in shale-gas deposits are drawing interests in employing catalytic propane dehydrogenation (PDH) to produce propylene."

[2] "Development of cost-effective and environmentally friendly catalysts (e.g., Ga-, Zn- or Sn-based candidates) remains as an important catalytic challenge [1224]."

The growing demand for propylene has led to increased interest in catalytic propane dehydrogenation (PDH) as a production method. This interest is further fueled by the large reserves of propane in shale-gas deposits. The development of PDH has focused on finding cost-effective and environmentally friendly catalysts, with Ga-, Zn-, and Sn-based candidates being explored as alternatives to traditional Pt- and Cr-based catalysts.

However, the literature provided does not contain specific information about the evolution of understanding regarding Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts for PDH, the debate about active Ga species, or recent research findings related to these catalysts. The text focuses more on Co-based catalysts and does not discuss Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts in detail.

丙烯需求的增长导致了对催化丙烷脱氢(PDH)作为生产方法的兴趣增加。页岩气中大量的丙烷储备进一步推动了这一兴趣。PDH的发展重点是寻找经济有效和环境友好的催化剂，以Ga-、Zn-和Sn-基候选物作为传统Pt-和Cr-基催化剂的替代品。

然而，所提供的文献并不包含关于Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂在PDH中的理解演变、活性Ga物种的争论或与这些催化剂相关的最新研究发现的具体信息。该文本更多地关注Co基催化剂，而没有详细讨论Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂。
