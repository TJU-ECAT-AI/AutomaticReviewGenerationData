[1] "Propylene is a key commodity chemical for the manufacture of a wide variety of products such as polypropylene, propylene oxide, acetone, acrylonitrile and acrolein [14]. The increasing global demand of propylene and a large reserve of propane in shale-gas deposits are drawing interests in employing catalytic propane dehydrogenation (PDH) to produce propylene."

[2] "Development of cost-effective and environmentally friendly catalysts (e.g., Ga-, Zn- or Sn-based candidates) remains as an important catalytic challenge [1224]."

The growing demand for propylene has led to increased interest in catalytic propane dehydrogenation (PDH) as a production method. This interest is driven by the increasing global demand for propylene and the large reserves of propane in shale-gas deposits. The development of new, cost-effective, and environmentally friendly catalysts for PDH, including those based on Ga, Zn, or Sn, remains an important challenge in the field.

However, the literature provided does not contain specific information about the evolution of understanding Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts for PDH, the debate about active Ga species, or recent research findings related to these catalysts. The document focuses more on Co-based catalysts and does not discuss Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts in detail.

丙烯需求的增长促使人们对催化丙烷脱氢(PDH)作为生产方法产生了更大的兴趣。这种兴趣源于全球对丙烯需求的增加和页岩气中大量丙烷储备的存在。开发新的、具有成本效益和环境友好的PDH催化剂，包括基于Ga、Zn或Sn的催化剂，仍然是该领域的一个重要挑战。

然而，所提供的文献并不包含关于Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂在PDH中的理解演变、活性Ga物种的争论或与这些催化剂相关的最新研究发现的具体信息。该文档更多地关注基于Co的催化剂，而没有详细讨论Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂。
