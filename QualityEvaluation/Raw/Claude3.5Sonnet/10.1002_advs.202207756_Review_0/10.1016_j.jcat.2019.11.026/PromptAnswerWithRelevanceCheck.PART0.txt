[1] "Propylene is a key commodity chemical for the manufacture of a wide variety of products such as polypropylene, propylene oxide, acetone, acrylonitrile and acrolein [14]. The increasing global demand of propylene and a large reserve of propane in shale-gas deposits are drawing interests in employing catalytic propane dehydrogenation (PDH) to produce propylene."

[2] "Development of cost-effective and environmentally friendly catalysts (e.g., Ga-, Zn- or Sn-based candidates) remains as an important catalytic challenge [1224]."

The growing demand for propylene has led to increased interest in catalytic propane dehydrogenation (PDH) as a production method. This interest is driven by the increasing global demand for propylene and the large reserves of propane in shale-gas deposits. The development of new, cost-effective, and environmentally friendly catalysts for PDH, including those based on Ga, Zn, or Sn, remains an important challenge in the field.

However, the literature provided does not contain specific information about the evolution of understanding Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts for PDH, the debate about active Ga species, or recent research findings related to these catalysts. The document focuses more on Co-based catalysts and does not discuss Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts in detail.

丙烯需求的增长促使人们对催化丙烷脱氢(PDH)作为生产方法产生了更大的兴趣。这种兴趣源于全球对丙烯需求的增加和页岩气中大量丙烷储备的存在。开发新的、具有成本效益和环境友好的PDH催化剂，包括基于Ga、Zn或Sn的催化剂，仍然是该领域的一个重要挑战。

然而，所提供的文献并不包含关于Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂在PDH中的理解演变、活性Ga物种的争论或与这些催化剂相关的最新研究发现的具体信息。该文档更多地关注基于Co的催化剂，而没有详细讨论Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂。

The growing demand for propylene has led to increased interest in catalytic propane dehydrogenation (PDH) as a production method. This is partly driven by the large reserves of propane in shale-gas deposits. The development of PDH has focused on finding cost-effective and environmentally friendly catalysts, with Ga-, Zn-, and Sn-based catalysts being explored as alternatives to traditional Pt- and Cr-based catalysts.

However, the provided literature does not contain specific information about the evolution of understanding Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts for PDH, the debate about active Ga species, or recent research findings related to these catalysts. The document focuses more on Co-based catalysts and does not discuss Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts in detail.

丙烯需求的增长推动了催化丙烷脱氢(PDH)作为生产方法的兴趣增加。这部分是由页岩气中大量的丙烷储备所驱动的。PDH的发展主要集中在寻找具有成本效益和环境友好的催化剂，其中Ga、Zn和Sn基催化剂被作为传统Pt和Cr基催化剂的替代品进行探索。

然而，提供的文献中并没有包含关于Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂在PDH中的理解演变、活性Ga物种的争论或与这些催化剂相关的最新研究发现的具体信息。该文档更多地关注Co基催化剂，并没有详细讨论Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂。

丙烯需求的增长导致了对催化丙烷脱氢(PDH)作为生产方法的兴趣增加。页岩气中大量的丙烷储备进一步推动了这一兴趣。PDH的发展重点是寻找经济有效和环境友好的催化剂，以Ga-、Zn-和Sn-基候选物作为传统Pt-和Cr-基催化剂的替代品。

然而，所提供的文献并不包含关于Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂在PDH中的理解演变、活性Ga物种的争论或与这些催化剂相关的最新研究发现的具体信息。该文本更多地关注Co基催化剂，而没有详细讨论Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂。

The growing demand for propylene has led to increased interest in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) as a production method. This is driven by the rising global demand for propylene and the availability of large propane reserves in shale-gas deposits. Currently, commercial PDH processes primarily use PtSn/Al2O3 or Cr/Al2O3 catalysts. However, due to the high cost of Pt and toxicity concerns with Cr, there is ongoing research to develop more cost-effective and environmentally friendly catalysts, including those based on Ga, Zn, or Sn.

The literature provided does not contain specific information about the evolution of understanding Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts for PDH, the debate about active Ga species, or recent research findings related to these catalysts. Therefore, this part of the question cannot be answered based on the given information.

The growing demand for propylene has led to increased interest in catalytic propane dehydrogenation (PDH) as a production method, particularly due to the large reserves of propane in shale gas deposits. This has driven the development of new catalysts and production technologies.

Currently, commercial PDH processes primarily use two technologies: the Oleflex process with PtSn/Al2O3 catalysts and the Catofin process with Cr/Al2O3 catalysts. However, there is an ongoing effort to develop more cost-effective and environmentally friendly catalysts, including those based on Ga, Zn, or Sn.

The literature does not provide specific information about the evolution of understanding Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts for PDH or recent research findings related to active Ga species. Therefore, this part of the question cannot be answered based on the given text.
