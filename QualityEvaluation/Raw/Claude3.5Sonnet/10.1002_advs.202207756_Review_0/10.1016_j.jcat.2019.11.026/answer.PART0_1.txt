[1] "Propylene is a key commodity chemical for the manufacture of a wide variety of products such as polypropylene, propylene oxide, acetone, acrylonitrile and acrolein [14]. The increasing global demand of propylene and a large reserve of propane in shale-gas deposits are drawing interests in employing catalytic propane dehydrogenation (PDH) to produce propylene."

[2] "Development of cost-effective and environmentally friendly catalysts (e.g., Ga-, Zn- or Sn-based candidates) remains as an important catalytic challenge [1224]."

The growing demand for propylene has led to increased interest in catalytic propane dehydrogenation (PDH) as a production method. This is partly driven by the large reserves of propane in shale-gas deposits. The development of PDH has focused on finding cost-effective and environmentally friendly catalysts, with Ga-, Zn-, and Sn-based catalysts being explored as alternatives to traditional Pt- and Cr-based catalysts.

However, the provided literature does not contain specific information about the evolution of understanding Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts for PDH, the debate about active Ga species, or recent research findings related to these catalysts. The document focuses more on Co-based catalysts and does not discuss Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts in detail.

丙烯需求的增长推动了催化丙烷脱氢(PDH)作为生产方法的兴趣增加。这部分是由页岩气中大量的丙烷储备所驱动的。PDH的发展主要集中在寻找具有成本效益和环境友好的催化剂，其中Ga、Zn和Sn基催化剂被作为传统Pt和Cr基催化剂的替代品进行探索。

然而，提供的文献中并没有包含关于Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂在PDH中的理解演变、活性Ga物种的争论或与这些催化剂相关的最新研究发现的具体信息。该文档更多地关注Co基催化剂，并没有详细讨论Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂。
