[1] "Propylene is a key commodity chemical for the manufacture of a wide variety of products such as polypropylene, propylene oxide, acetone, acrylonitrile and acrolein [14]. The increasing global demand of propylene and a large reserve of propane in shale-gas deposits are drawing interests in employing catalytic propane dehydrogenation (PDH) to produce propylene."

[2] "The commercial PDH processes are based on two kinds of primary technologies, the Oleflex process with PtSn/Al2O3 catalyst and the Catofin process with Cr/Al2O3 catalyst [5]."

[3] "Development of cost-effective and environmentally friendly catalysts (e.g., Ga-, Zn- or Sn-based candidates) remains as an important catalytic challenge [1224]."

The growing demand for propylene has led to increased interest in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) as a production method. This is driven by the rising global demand for propylene and the availability of large propane reserves in shale-gas deposits. Currently, commercial PDH processes primarily use PtSn/Al2O3 or Cr/Al2O3 catalysts. However, due to the high cost of Pt and toxicity concerns with Cr, there is ongoing research to develop more cost-effective and environmentally friendly catalysts, including those based on Ga, Zn, or Sn.

The literature provided does not contain specific information about the evolution of understanding Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts for PDH, the debate about active Ga species, or recent research findings related to these catalysts. Therefore, this part of the question cannot be answered based on the given information.

丙烯需求的增长促使人们对丙烷脱氢(PDH)作为生产方法产生了更大的兴趣。这是由全球丙烯需求的上升和页岩气藏中大量丙烷储备的可用性所驱动的。目前，商业PDH工艺主要使用PtSn/Al2O3或Cr/Al2O3催化剂。然而，由于Pt的高成本和Cr的毒性问题，目前正在进行研究开发更具成本效益和环境友好的催化剂，包括基于Ga、Zn或Sn的催化剂。

提供的文献中没有包含关于理解Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂用于PDH的演变、活性Ga物种的争论或与这些催化剂相关的最新研究发现的具体信息。因此，根据给出的信息无法回答问题的这一部分。
