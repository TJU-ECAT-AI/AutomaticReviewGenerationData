[1] "Propylene is a key commodity chemical for the manufacture of a wide variety of products such as polypropylene, propylene oxide, acetone, acrylonitrile and acrolein [14]. The increasing global demand of propylene and a large reserve of propane in shale-gas deposits are drawing interests in employing catalytic propane dehydrogenation (PDH) to produce propylene."

[2] "The commercial PDH processes are based on two kinds of primary technologies, the Oleflex process with PtSn/Al2O3 catalyst and the Catofin process with Cr/Al2O3 catalyst [5]."

[3] "Development of cost-effective and environmentally friendly catalysts (e.g., Ga-, Zn- or Sn-based candidates) remains as an important catalytic challenge [1224]."

The growing demand for propylene has led to increased interest in catalytic propane dehydrogenation (PDH) as a production method, particularly due to the large reserves of propane in shale gas deposits. This has driven the development of new catalysts and production technologies.

Currently, commercial PDH processes primarily use two technologies: the Oleflex process with PtSn/Al2O3 catalysts and the Catofin process with Cr/Al2O3 catalysts. However, there is an ongoing effort to develop more cost-effective and environmentally friendly catalysts, including those based on Ga, Zn, or Sn.

The literature does not provide specific information about the evolution of understanding Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts for PDH or recent research findings related to active Ga species. Therefore, this part of the question cannot be answered based on the given text.

丙烯需求的增长促使人们对催化丙烷脱氢(PDH)作为生产方法产生了更大的兴趣，特别是由于页岩气储量中含有大量丙烷。这推动了新型催化剂和生产技术的发展。

目前，商业PDH工艺主要使用两种技术：使用PtSn/Al2O3催化剂的Oleflex工艺和使用Cr/Al2O3催化剂的Catofin工艺。然而，业界正在努力开发更具成本效益和环境友好的催化剂，包括基于Ga、Zn或Sn的催化剂。

文献中没有提供关于Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂在PDH中的理解演变或与活性Ga物种相关的最新研究发现的具体信息。因此，根据给定的文本无法回答问题的这一部分。
