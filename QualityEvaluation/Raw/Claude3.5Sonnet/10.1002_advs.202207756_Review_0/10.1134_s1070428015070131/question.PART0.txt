Abstract1-(3-R-adamantan-1-yl)-2-[(triphenyl-λ5-phosphanylidene)hydrazinylidene]ethanone reacted with 
4-aryl(hetaryl)-2,4-dioxobutanoic acids to give 2-{2-[2-(3-R-adamantan-1-yl)-2-oxoethylidene]hydrazinyl}-4-
aryl(hetaryl)-4-oxobut-2-enoic acids which were shown to exist in solution as mixtures of Z- and E-isomeric 
enehydrazine tautomers. The products underwent cyclization to 3-{[2-(3-R-adamantan-1-yl)-2-oxoethylidene]-
hydrazinylidene}-5-aryl(hetaryl)furan-2(3H)-ones.

Chemical transformations of 3-hydrazinylidene-
(imino)furan-2(3H)-ones afforded a variety of com-
pounds [110], including those possessing biological 
activity [1115]. Introduction of a pharmacophoric 
adamantyl fragment [1619] into molecules of 3-hy-
drazinylidenefuran-2(3H)-ones extends the potential of 
these compounds as biologically active substances. 
Cyclization of 4-aryl-2-(2-methylidenehydrazinyl)-4-
oxobut-2-enoic acids by the action of aliphatic carbox-
ylic acid anhydrides [2022] is one of the most con-
venient methods of synthesis of 5-aryl-3-hydrazinyli-
denefuran-2(3H)-ones containing various substituents 
in the hydrazine moiety. The initial acids can be pre-
pared by reaction of (triphenyl-λ5-phosphanylidene)-
hydrazones (phosphazenes) with 4-aryl-2,4-dioxobuta-
noic acid derivatives [13].  
We have synthesized 3-{[2-(3-R-adamantan-1-yl)-
2-oxoethylidene]hydrazinylidene}-5-aryl(hetaryl)fur-
an-2(3H)-ones by cyclization of 2-hydrazinyl deriva-
tives of 4-aryl(hetaryl)-4-oxobut-2-enoic acids contain-
ing a pharmacophoric adamantyl fragment. By reaction 
of 2,4-dioxobutanoic acids 1a1e with an equimolar 
amount of triphenylphosphazenes 2a and 2b in anhy-
drous toluene we obtained 2-{2-[2-(3-R-adamantan-1-
yl)-2-oxoethylidene]hydrazinyl}-4-aryl(hetaryl)-4-
oxobut-2-enoic acids 3a3f in good yields (Scheme 1).  
Acids 3a3f were isolated as yellow crystalline 
substances. They showed in the IR spectra absorption 
bands in the regions 31243290 (NH), 17031723 
(C=O, acid), 16621678 (AdC=O), and 1583 
1638 cm1 C4=O, C=C, C=N). The reduced carbonyl 
stretching vibration frequencies suggest formation of 
strong intramolecular hydrogen bonds in the Z isomers 
of 3a3f. 
According to the 1H NMR data, compounds 3a3f 
in DMSO-d6 exist as mixtures of Z- and E-isomeric 
enehydrazine tautomers AC, structure A prevailing 
(3664%). Unlike structurally related compounds  
[13, 2026], no β-ketohydrazone tautomers of 3a3f 
were detected. Structure A displayed in the 1H NMR 
spectrum a multiplet at δ 1.622.48 ppm from protons 
in the adamantyl substituent, a singlet at δ 6.24 
6.88 ppm from the vinylic proton, a multiplet at  
δ 7.048.03 ppm from aromatic (heteroaromatic) pro-
tons, and singlets at δ 7.778.06 (CH=N) and 12.46
13.42 ppm (NH). Isomer B (2556%) was character-
ized by singlets due to vinylic proton at δ 6.43 
7.03 ppm, N=CH proton at δ 7.728.15 ppm, and NH 
proton at δ 14.7715.58 ppm. The corresponding 
signals of isomer C (613%) were observed at 6.51
7.11, 7.317.75, and 10.8811.94 ppm, respectively.

1-yl)-2-oxoethylidene]hydrazinylidene}-5-aryl(het-
aryl)furan-2(3H)-ones 4a4f as orange crystalline sub-
stances. Their IR spectra contained absorption bands 
due to stretching vibrations of the C2=O carbonyl 
group in the furan ring (17901857 cm1), adamantoyl 
carbonyl (16721692 cm1), and C=C and C=N bonds 
(15841631 cm1). In the 1H NMR spectra of 4a4f, 
adamantyl protons appeared as a multiplet at δ 1.69
2.39 ppm, the 4-H proton in the furan ring resonated as 
a singlet at δ 6.827.20 ppm, aromatic proton signals 
were located at δ 6.607.99 ppm, and the CH=N 
proton gave a singlet at δ 7.918.15 ppm.  
The proposed synthetic route to furan-2(3H)-ones 
4a4f is of preparative significance, and it ensures 
high yield of the products. The direct reaction of  
5-arylfuran-2,3-diones with triphenylphosphazenes 
derived from diazo ketones is accompanied by anoma-
lous diaza-Wittig reaction involving the lactone 
carbonyl group with formation of 2-hydrazinylidene 
derivatives despite the presence of a ketone carbonyl 
group in the initial heterocycle [2729]. 
EXPERIMENTAL 
The IR spectra were recorded on an FSM-1202 
spectrometer (Russia) from samples dispersed in 
mineral oil. The 1H NMR spectra were measured on  
a Varian Mercury Plus-300 spectrometer at 300 MHz 
using DMSO-d6 as solvent and hexamethyldisiloxane 
as internal standard. The purity of the isolated com-
pounds was checked, and the progress of reactions was 
monitored, by TLC on Sorbfil PTSKh P-A-UF-254 
plates using diethyl etherbenzeneacetone (10 : 9 : 1) 
and ethyl acetatehexane (5 : 1) as eluents; spots were 
detected under UV light. The elemental analyses were 
obtained on a LECO 932 CNH(S) analyzer. 
Acids 3a3f (general procedure). A suspension of 
0.01 mol of acid 1a1e and 0.01 mol of triphenylphos-
phazene 2a or 2b in 3040 mL of anhydrous toluene 
was stirred at 2025C until complete dissolution of 
the reactants. The resulting solution was cooled to  
05C, and the precipitate was filtered off and recrys-
tallized from acetonitrile.

Here are the question lists, in <questions></questions>XML tags:
<questions>


How has the growing demand for propylene influenced the development of new production methods, particularly propane dehydrogenation (PDH), and how has the understanding of Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts for PDH evolved, including the ongoing debate about active Ga species and recent research findings that have contributed to our current knowledge of these catalysts?

First, you need to sequentially extract any quotes in the literature that are most relevant to each question, and print them in numbered order, separated by newlines. Quotes should be relatively brief. Do not attempt to summarize or answer questions at this stage, but simply repeat exactly what the corresponding part of the literature says.

Please enclose the full list of quotes in <quotes></quotes> XML tags. If there are no relevant quotes, write "No relevant quotes" instead.

Then, answer the question, starting with "Answer:".  Do not include or reference quoted content verbatim in the answer. Don't say "According to Quote [1]" when answering. Do not write reference number of quotes after answer. Put your answer to the user inside <EnglishVersionAnswer></EnglishVersionAnswer> XML tags. Output formatted text, with line breaks for each question.Separate quotes and answers with a blank line. Provide the answers to all questions in English. After completing the English answers, translate all those answers into Chinese and provide the Chinese version inside <ChineseVersionAnswer></ChineseVersionAnswer> XML tags.

Thus, the format of your overall response should look like what's shown between the <example></example> tags.  Make sure to follow the formatting and spacing exactly.
