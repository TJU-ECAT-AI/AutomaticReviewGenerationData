[1] "Propene is one of the most important petrochemicals mainly used in polymer production [1]. The most common processes for synthesis of this olefin are steam cracking of naphtha and fluidized catalytic cracking of heavy oil fractions [2]. Since they cannot match the continuously increasing demand for propene, other processes have been commercialized for on-purpose large-scale production, which are metathesis of ethylene and 2-butenes as well as non-oxidative propane dehydrogenation (PDH) [3,4]."

[2] "The latter process is performed over supported CrOx- and Pt-based catalysts [46]. Cr-containing compounds are, however, toxic and lead to health and environmental concerns. On the other hand, Pt-based catalysts are environmentally friendly. To ensure high dispersion of Pt species, which is important for high activity and selectivity, such catalysts, however, have to be treated under chlorine atmosphere after removal of carbon deposits [5]. High price of Pt is another shortcoming of Pt-based catalysts."

[3] "Stimulated by the drawbacks mentioned above, various research groups in both industry and academia have attempted to improve available commercial catalysts or to develop suitable alternatives. Among the latter materials, those containing supported GaOx, VOx, or InOx species have been identified to be the most suitable candidates [515]."

The growing demand for propylene has led to the development of new production methods, particularly propane dehydrogenation (PDH). Traditional methods like steam cracking of naphtha and fluidized catalytic cracking of heavy oil fractions could not meet the increasing demand, so on-purpose large-scale production processes like PDH were commercialized.

PDH is typically performed using supported CrOx- and Pt-based catalysts. However, these catalysts have drawbacks: Cr-containing compounds are toxic and raise environmental concerns, while Pt-based catalysts are expensive and require chlorine treatment.

To address these issues, researchers have been working on improving existing catalysts and developing alternatives. Catalysts containing supported GaOx, VOx, or InOx species have been identified as promising candidates for PDH.

The literature does not provide specific information about the evolution of understanding Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts for PDH or the ongoing debate about active Ga species. It also does not mention recent research findings that have contributed to our current knowledge of these catalysts.

丙烯需求的不断增长促使新的生产方法的发展，特别是丙烷脱氢(PDH)。传统方法如石脑油蒸汽裂解和重油馏分流化催化裂解无法满足日益增长的需求，因此商业化了像PDH这样的专门大规模生产工艺。

PDH通常使用负载的CrOx和Pt基催化剂进行。然而，这些催化剂存在缺点：含Cr化合物有毒且引起环境问题，而Pt基催化剂昂贵且需要氯气处理。

为解决这些问题，研究人员一直致力于改进现有催化剂并开发替代品。含有负载GaOx、VOx或InOx物种的催化剂被认为是PDH的有前景候选者。

文献中没有提供关于Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂用于PDH的认识演变或活性Ga物种持续争论的具体信息。它也没有提到对这些催化剂当前认知有贡献的最新研究发现。
