[1] "Propene is one of the most important petrochemicals mainly used in polymer production [1]. The most common processes for synthesis of this olefin are steam cracking of naphtha and fluidized catalytic cracking of heavy oil fractions [2]. Since they cannot match the continuously increasing demand for propene, other processes have been commercialized for on-purpose large-scale production, which are metathesis of ethylene and 2-butenes as well as non-oxidative propane dehydrogenation (PDH) [3,4]."

[2] "The latter process is performed over supported CrOx- and Pt-based catalysts [46]. Cr-containing compounds are, however, toxic and lead to health and environmental concerns. On the other hand, Pt-based catalysts are environmentally friendly. To ensure high dispersion of Pt species, which is important for high activity and selectivity, such catalysts, however, have to be treated under chlorine atmosphere after removal of carbon deposits [5]. High price of Pt is another shortcoming of Pt-based catalysts."

[3] "Stimulated by the drawbacks mentioned above, various research groups in both industry and academia have attempted to improve available commercial catalysts or to develop suitable alternatives. Among the latter materials, those containing supported GaOx, VOx, or InOx species have been identified to be the most suitable candidates [515]."

The growing demand for propylene has led to the development and commercialization of new production methods, particularly non-oxidative propane dehydrogenation (PDH). Traditional methods like steam cracking of naphtha and fluidized catalytic cracking of heavy oil fractions cannot meet the increasing demand, prompting the adoption of PDH as an on-purpose large-scale production process.

Initially, PDH processes used supported CrOx- and Pt-based catalysts. However, these catalysts have drawbacks: Cr-containing compounds are toxic and raise environmental concerns, while Pt-based catalysts, though environmentally friendly, require chlorine treatment and are expensive.

These limitations have spurred research efforts to improve existing catalysts and develop alternatives. Catalysts containing supported GaOx, VOx, or InOx species have emerged as promising candidates. However, the literature does not provide specific information about the evolution of understanding Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts for PDH, the debate about active Ga species, or recent research findings contributing to the current knowledge of these catalysts.

丙烯需求的不断增长推动了新生产方法的开发和商业化，特别是非氧化丙烷脱氢（PDH）。传统方法如石脑油蒸汽裂解和重油馏分流化催化裂解无法满足不断增长的需求，促使PDH作为一种专门的大规模生产工艺被采用。

最初，PDH工艺使用负载型CrOx和Pt基催化剂。然而，这些催化剂存在缺点：含Cr化合物有毒且引起环境问题，而Pt基催化剂虽然环保，但需要氯气处理且价格昂贵。

这些限制刺激了改进现有催化剂和开发替代品的研究努力。含有负载型GaOx、VOx或InOx物种的催化剂已成为有前景的候选者。然而，文献并未提供关于Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂在PDH中的认识演变、活性Ga物种的争论，或近期研究发现对这些催化剂当前认知贡献的具体信息。
