[1] "Propene is one of the most important petrochemicals mainly used in polymer production [1]. The most common processes for synthesis of this olefin are steam cracking of naphtha and fluidized catalytic cracking of heavy oil fractions [2]. Since they cannot match the continuously increasing demand for propene, other processes have been commercialized for on-purpose large-scale production, which are metathesis of ethylene and 2-butenes as well as non-oxidative propane dehydrogenation (PDH) [3,4]."

[2] "The latter process is performed over supported CrOx- and Pt-based catalysts [46]. Cr-containing compounds are, however, toxic and lead to health and environmental concerns. On the other hand, Pt-based catalysts are environmentally friendly. To ensure high dispersion of Pt species, which is important for high activity and selectivity, such catalysts, however, have to be treated under chlorine atmosphere after removal of carbon deposits [5]. High price of Pt is another shortcoming of Pt-based catalysts."

[3] "Stimulated by the drawbacks mentioned above, various research groups in both industry and academia have attempted to improve available commercial catalysts or to develop suitable alternatives. Among the latter materials, those containing supported GaOx, VOx, or InOx species have been identified to be the most suitable candidates [515]."

The growing demand for propylene has led to the development of new production methods, particularly propane dehydrogenation (PDH), as traditional processes like steam cracking and fluidized catalytic cracking cannot meet the increasing demand. PDH has been commercialized for on-purpose large-scale propylene production, alongside metathesis of ethylene and 2-butenes.

Initially, PDH was performed using supported CrOx- and Pt-based catalysts. However, these catalysts have drawbacks: Cr-containing compounds are toxic and raise environmental concerns, while Pt-based catalysts, though environmentally friendly, require chlorine treatment and are expensive.

These limitations have prompted research into alternative catalysts. Supported GaOx, VOx, and InOx species have been identified as promising candidates for PDH catalysts. However, the literature provided does not specifically discuss the evolution of understanding regarding Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts for PDH or the ongoing debate about active Ga species. The document focuses more on ZrO2-based catalysts rather than Ga-containing catalysts.

丙烯需求的持续增长推动了新生产方法的发展，特别是丙烷脱氢(PDH)，因为传统的蒸汽裂解和流化催化裂解工艺无法满足日益增长的需求。PDH已被商业化用于大规模定向生产丙烯，与乙烯和2-丁烯的复分解反应并列。

最初，PDH使用负载型CrOx和Pt基催化剂进行。然而，这些催化剂存在缺点：含Cr化合物有毒且引发环境问题，而Pt基催化剂虽然环保，但需要氯气处理且价格昂贵。

这些限制促使研究人员寻找替代催化剂。负载型GaOx、VOx和InOx物种被认为是有前景的PDH催化剂候选者。然而，所提供的文献并未具体讨论关于PDH用Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂理解的演变，或关于活性Ga物种的持续争论。该文档更多地关注ZrO2基催化剂，而非含Ga催化剂。
