[1] "Propene is one of the most important petrochemicals mainly used in polymer production [1]. The most common processes for synthesis of this olefin are steam cracking of naphtha and fluidized catalytic cracking of heavy oil fractions [2]. Since they cannot match the continuously increasing demand for propene, other processes have been commercialized for on-purpose large-scale production, which are metathesis of ethylene and 2-butenes as well as non-oxidative propane dehydrogenation (PDH) [3,4]."

[2] "The latter process is performed over supported CrOx- and Pt-based catalysts [46]. Cr-containing compounds are, however, toxic and lead to health and environmental concerns. On the other hand, Pt-based catalysts are environmentally friendly. To ensure high dispersion of Pt species, which is important for high activity and selectivity, such catalysts, however, have to be treated under chlorine atmosphere after removal of carbon deposits [5]. High price of Pt is another shortcoming of Pt-based catalysts."

[3] "Stimulated by the drawbacks mentioned above, various research groups in both industry and academia have attempted to improve available commercial catalysts or to develop suitable alternatives. Among the latter materials, those containing supported GaOx, VOx, or InOx species have been identified to be the most suitable candidates [515]."

The growing demand for propylene has led to the development of new production methods, particularly propane dehydrogenation (PDH). Traditional processes like steam cracking of naphtha and fluidized catalytic cracking of heavy oil fractions could not meet the increasing demand, so on-purpose large-scale production methods were commercialized. These include metathesis of ethylene and 2-butenes, as well as non-oxidative propane dehydrogenation (PDH).

PDH is typically performed using supported CrOx- and Pt-based catalysts. However, these catalysts have drawbacks: Cr-containing compounds are toxic and raise health and environmental concerns, while Pt-based catalysts require chlorine treatment and are expensive. These limitations have spurred research into improving existing catalysts and developing alternatives.

Catalysts containing supported GaOx, VOx, or InOx species have been identified as promising alternatives for PDH. However, the literature provided does not contain specific information about the evolution of understanding Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts for PDH, the ongoing debate about active Ga species, or recent research findings contributing to current knowledge of these catalysts.

丙烯需求的持续增长推动了新生产方法的发展，特别是丙烷脱氢(PDH)。传统的生产工艺如石脑油蒸汽裂解和重油馏分流化催化裂解无法满足日益增长的需求，因此商业化了一些定向大规模生产方法。这些方法包括乙烯和2-丁烯的复分解以及非氧化丙烷脱氢(PDH)。

PDH通常使用负载型CrOx和Pt基催化剂进行。然而，这些催化剂存在缺点：含Cr化合物具有毒性，引发健康和环境问题，而Pt基催化剂需要氯气处理且价格昂贵。这些限制促使研究人员改进现有催化剂并开发替代品。

含有负载GaOx、VOx或InOx物种的催化剂被确定为PDH的有前景的替代品。然而，所提供的文献并未包含关于Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂在PDH中的理解演变、活性Ga物种的持续争论，或最近对这些催化剂当前认知有贡献的研究发现的具体信息。
