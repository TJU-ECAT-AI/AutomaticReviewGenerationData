How has the growing demand for propylene influenced the development of new production methods, particularly propane dehydrogenation (PDH), and how has the understanding of Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts for PDH evolved, including the ongoing debate about active Ga species and recent research findings that have contributed to our current knowledge of these catalysts?

[1] "Propene is one of the most important petrochemicals mainly used in polymer production [1]. The most common processes for synthesis of this olefin are steam cracking of naphtha and fluidized catalytic cracking of heavy oil fractions [2]. Since they cannot match the continuously increasing demand for propene, other processes have been commercialized for on-purpose large-scale production, which are metathesis of ethylene and 2-butenes as well as non-oxidative propane dehydrogenation (PDH) [3,4]."

[2] "The latter process is performed over supported CrOx- and Pt-based catalysts [46]. Cr-containing compounds are, however, toxic and lead to health and environmental concerns. On the other hand, Pt-based catalysts are environmentally friendly. To ensure high dispersion of Pt species, which is important for high activity and selectivity, such catalysts, however, have to be treated under chlorine atmosphere after removal of carbon deposits [5]. High price of Pt is another shortcoming of Pt-based catalysts."

[3] "Stimulated by the drawbacks mentioned above, various research groups in both industry and academia have attempted to improve available commercial catalysts or to develop suitable alternatives. Among the latter materials, those containing supported GaOx, VOx, or InOx species have been identified to be the most suitable candidates [515]."

The growing demand for propylene has led to the development and commercialization of new production methods, particularly non-oxidative propane dehydrogenation (PDH). This process was introduced because traditional methods like steam cracking of naphtha and fluidized catalytic cracking of heavy oil fractions could not meet the increasing demand for propene.

Initially, PDH processes used supported CrOx- and Pt-based catalysts. However, these catalysts had significant drawbacks. Cr-containing compounds are toxic and raise environmental concerns, while Pt-based catalysts, although environmentally friendly, are expensive and require complex treatment procedures.

These limitations stimulated research into alternative catalysts. Materials containing supported GaOx, VOx, or InOx species have been identified as promising candidates for PDH catalysts. However, the literature provided does not contain specific information about the evolution of understanding Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts for PDH or ongoing debates about active Ga species. The document focuses more on zirconia-based catalysts rather than providing detailed information about Ga-based catalysts or recent research findings related to them.

丙烯需求的不断增长推动了新生产方法的发展和商业化，特别是非氧化丙烷脱氢（PDH）。引入这一工艺是因为传统方法如石脑油蒸汽裂解和重油馏分流化催化裂解无法满足日益增长的丙烯需求。

最初，PDH工艺使用负载的CrOx和Pt基催化剂。然而，这些催化剂存在显著缺点。含Cr化合物有毒且引发环境问题，而Pt基催化剂虽然环境友好，但价格昂贵且需要复杂的处理程序。

这些限制刺激了对替代催化剂的研究。含有负载GaOx、VOx或InOx物种的材料被确定为PDH催化剂的有前景候选者。然而，所提供的文献并不包含关于理解Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂用于PDH的演变或关于活性Ga物种的持续争论的具体信息。该文档更多地关注基于氧化锆的催化剂，而不是提供关于基于Ga的催化剂或与之相关的最新研究发现的详细信息。

丙烯需求的持续增长推动了新生产方法的发展，特别是丙烷脱氢(PDH)，因为传统的蒸汽裂解和流化催化裂解工艺无法满足日益增长的需求。PDH已被商业化用于大规模定向生产丙烯，与乙烯和2-丁烯的复分解反应并列。

最初，PDH使用负载型CrOx和Pt基催化剂进行。然而，这些催化剂存在缺点：含Cr化合物有毒且引发环境问题，而Pt基催化剂虽然环保，但需要氯气处理且价格昂贵。

这些限制促使研究人员寻找替代催化剂。负载型GaOx、VOx和InOx物种被认为是有前景的PDH催化剂候选者。然而，所提供的文献并未具体讨论关于PDH用Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂理解的演变，或关于活性Ga物种的持续争论。该文档更多地关注ZrO2基催化剂，而非含Ga催化剂。

The growing demand for propylene has led to the development and commercialization of new production methods, particularly non-oxidative propane dehydrogenation (PDH). Traditional methods like steam cracking of naphtha and fluidized catalytic cracking of heavy oil fractions cannot meet the increasing demand, prompting the adoption of PDH as an on-purpose large-scale production process.

Initially, PDH processes used supported CrOx- and Pt-based catalysts. However, these catalysts have drawbacks: Cr-containing compounds are toxic and raise environmental concerns, while Pt-based catalysts, though environmentally friendly, require chlorine treatment and are expensive.

These limitations have spurred research efforts to improve existing catalysts and develop alternatives. Catalysts containing supported GaOx, VOx, or InOx species have emerged as promising candidates.
