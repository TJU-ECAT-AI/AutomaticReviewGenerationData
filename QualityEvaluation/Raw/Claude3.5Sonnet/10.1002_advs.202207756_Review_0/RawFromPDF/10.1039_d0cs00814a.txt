Propylene is an important building block for enormous petrochemicals including polypropylene,
propylene oxide, acrylonitrile and so forth. Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) is an industrial technology
for direct propylene production which has received extensive attention in recent years. With the
development of dehydrogenation technologies, the eﬃcient adsorption/activation of propane and
subsequential desorption of propylene on the surfaces of heterogeneous catalysts remain scientifically
challenging. This review describes recent advances in the fundamental understandings of the PDH
process in terms of emerging technologies, catalyst development and new chemistry in regulating the
catalyst structures and inhibiting the catalyst deactivation. The active sites, reaction pathways and
deactivation mechanisms of PDH over metals and metal oxides as well as their dependent factors are
also analysed and discussed, which is expected to enable eﬃcient catalyst design for minimizing the
reaction barriers and controlling the selectivity towards propylene. The challenges and perspectives of
PDH over heterogeneous catalysts are also proposed for further development.
1. Introduction
Propylene is the basic raw material for the production of
acrolein, polypropylene, acetone, acrylonitrile, propylene oxide
and other industrial products.1 Conventional propylene pro-
duction processes involve fluid catalytic cracking, and steam
cracking of naphtha and light diesel. However, with the rapid
consumption of fossil energy, traditional propylene production
methods can no longer meet the increasing demands. Therefore,
the development of highly eﬃcient propylene production
technologies is of vital importance, both scientifically and
economically.2 In the past few years, increasing technologies
for propylene production have been widely developed, such as
propane
dehydrogenation
(PDH),
the
methanol-to-olefins
(MTO) process, and the Fischer–Tropsch-to-olefins process
(Fig. 1a and b). Especially, PDH technology is considered to

be one of the most promising propylene production methods
because it is a proprietary method that produces only propylene,
not a hybrid product.3,4 In addition, with the development of
hydraulic fracturing technology, shale gas condensates which
contain a large amount of propane can be extracted on a massive
scale, making the feedstock cheaper and plentiful (Fig. 1c). The
Dow Chemical Company released a forecast in 2016 that the
demand for propylene will grow at an average annual rate of 2% to
3% by 2035, which is expected to exceed production capacity
between 2016 and 2035.5,6
Fundamentally, PDH is a process of catalytic conversion of
propane into propylene and hydrogen, as illustrated below
(eqn (1)):
C3H8 2 C3H6 + H2 (DHy
298 = 124.3 kJ mol1)
(1)
C3H8 2 CH4 + C2H4 (DHy
298 = 98.9 kJ mol1)
(2)
C3H8 + H2 2 C2H6 + CH4 (DHy
298 = 37.7 kJ mol1)
(3)
C2H4 + H2 2 C2H6 (DHy
298 = 136.6 kJ mol1)
(4)
C3H8 2 3C + 4H2 (DHy
298 = 119.5 kJ mol1)
(5)
The reaction is highly endothermic and a process that the
number of gas molecules increases, which implies that increa-
sing reaction temperatures and/or decreasing partial pressures
contribute to higher conversions of propane, as shown by the
thermodynamic analysis in Fig. 2a. Indeed, temperatures of
550–750 1C are typically required for PDH at 1 bar. By increasing
the temperature, the rates of both the C–H cleavage and compe-
titive C–C cleavage side reactions, such as cracking to ethylene
and methane (eqn (2)), are increased (Fig. 2b). Therefore, the
reaction conditions and reaction kinetics should be regulated to
inhibit the side reaction and improve the propylene selectivity and
productivity. Moreover, larger particles lead to side reactions such
as hydrogenolysis (eqn (3)), cracking (eqn (2)), hydrogenation
(eqn (4)) and coke (eqn (5)) reactions. These restrictions lead to
great challenges to the dehydrogenation technologies and catalyst
design.
To date, several representative processes for propane dehydro-
genation have been emerging. Among them, Oleflex and Catofin

processes have been industrialised and most widely applied,7,8
wherein Pt-based and CrOx-based catalysts have been commer-
cialized, respectively. In the Catofin process, owing to their low
price and high catalytic Lewis acid activity, CrOx-based catalysts
have been utilized. However, in addition to their high toxicity and
environmental hostility, the severe side reactions induce their
quick deactivation and frequent regeneration.9–11 Developing
alternative metal oxide catalysts with low or non-chromium
content is highly desired. Although the Pt catalyst shows excellent
propane dehydrogenation activity due to its affinity for paraffinic
C–H bonds and environmental friendliness, its high tendency to
coking and sintering and high cost still require the development

of low Pt-content and stable Pt-based catalysts via special
preparation methods, and support and promoter effects. While
the exact active sites of various Pt-based catalysts and the corres-
ponding reaction mechanisms in the PDH process remain contro-
versial, the difficulties mainly stem from the structural complexity of
supported nanoparticles and the uncertainty of relevant preparation
processes. Therefore, the exploitation of new efficient strategies for
improving the stability of Pt-based and CrOx-based catalysts and
finding alternative catalysts still remain great challenges.
PDH serves as the important industrial reaction and there
have been some review studies, involving the energy analysis
of diﬀerent PDH technologies,11,12 and catalyst preparation
methods and development.3,13 Remarkably, Bert M. Weckhuysen
and coworkers summarized the catalytic dehydrogenation of
light alkanes (ethane, propane, butane, etc.) on metals and
metal oxides before 2014, providing a very comprehensive
introduction.4 While newly developed dehydrogenation pro-
cesses, catalyst design strategies, and new chemistry in propane
dehydrogenation reactions have not been well summarized.
To date, the number of corresponding research studies has
reached up to 2291 and gradually increased based on the Web
of Science in the last ten years from 2010 to 2020 (Fig. 3).
The rapid developments of dehydrogenation technologies and
catalysts urge us to review the progress in recent years. Further
understanding on the principles could essentially provide a
creative perspective on propane dehydrogenation. The primary
focus of the current review will be on the recent advances and
developments in the process fundamentals and catalyst design
in PDH reactions. The remainder of this review is organized
into the following sections. We will first discuss the advanced
dehydrogenation
technologies
and
catalyst
development.
Afterward, we will illustrate the active sites, reaction pathways
and
deactivation
mechanisms
over
Pt-based
and
metal
oxide-based catalysts from the perspective of molecular
identification. The regulating strategies for inhibiting the
deactivation and advances in catalyst design are also discussed.
Finally, the challenges and perspectives on alternative technologies
and catalysts are proposed. In general, we expect that this com-
prehensive overview will provide more scientific guidance on
fundamentally optimizing the PDH process and catalyst design.
2. Dehydrogenation technologies and
catalyst development
With the boom of the PDH process, dehydrogenation techno-
logies and catalysts have been extensively developed and
updated. Several technologies including Catofin,14 Oleflex,15
FBD-4,16 PDH,17 STAR,18 ADHO,19 FCDh,20 and K-PROt 21
technologies have been commercialized and emerging in recent
years. Particularly, the Catofin and Oleflex processes are two
widely applied PDH technologies. In this section, we will briefly
introduce the basic operating procedures and applied catalysts,
which are shown in Fig. 4 and Table 1.
2.1
Industrial and emerging PDH processes
2.1.1
Catofin process. The Catofin process is C3–C5 alkane
dehydrogenation technology to produce olefins developed by
the ABB Lummus company. The Catofin process is divided into
four sections: reaction of propane dehydrogenation to propy-
lene, reactor discharge compression, product recovery and
refining units. The Catofin process uses counter-current flow
technology to change the flow direction of reactive materials,
air downward and hydrocarbons directly upward, so that more
products can be obtained with fewer raw materials, thus redu-
cing investments and operating costs. The chromium/alumi-
num catalysts, whose components include chromium oxide
with mass fractions greater than 18%, exhibit stable dehydro-
genation performance, high conversion rates of alkanes and
high propylene yields. The fixed bed reactor is operated in the
form of hydrocarbon/hot air circulation. Before entering the
catalyst bed, the hydrocarbons are preheated with hot air and
react at 650 1C and 0.5 bar. The selectivity of propylene is over
87%. Catofin has low requirements on raw material indexes, and
the load lifting speed of the device is fast after each feeding.
However, this technology has low efficiency and large energy
consumption. Additionally, the frequent switching under high
temperature conditions leads to the failure of the operating valve.
A heat generating material (HGM) is an innovative metal
oxide-based material designed to significantly increase the
selectivity and yield in the Catofin process. The HGM is loaded
into the reactor bed together with the catalyst to undergo
oxidation and reduction processes during the cycle operation,
generating heat to drive the dehydrogenation reaction. It can
not only increase propylene productivity, but also reduce energy
consumption and CO2 emissions. In 2012, the Catofin/HGM
concept was demonstrated on a commercial scale in industrial
Catofin installations.22
2.1.2
Oleflex process. The Honeywell UOP Oleflex process
converts propane into propylene by catalytic dehydrogenation
under moving bed reactors, and was commercialized in 1990.
Oleflex uses a fully recyclable platinum-based alumina catalyst
and has low production costs, high returns on investment and

low environmental footprints, and can convert propane-rich
liquefied petroleum gas (C3 LPG) feedstock into chemical
or polymer-grade propylene products. Recently, more eﬃcient
catalysts have been developed, such as the series of DeH
catalysts, which further decrease the Pt loading and increase
the propylene selectivity.23 The pre-treated C3 LPG feedstock is
introduced into the depropanizer. Butane or heavy components
in C3 LPG are discharged from the bottom of the depropanizer.

The top of the depropanizer is fed to the C3 Oleflex unit to
produce propylene rich liquid products and hydrogen-rich gas
products. The net hydrogen can be exported directly for modi-
fication of the pressure swing adsorption (PSA) or as a fuel in
the unit. Oleflex dehydrogenation units can be easily integrated
with downstream conversion processes, such as alkylation,
to produce high-octane alkylation oils, or isobutylene dimerization,
followed by hydrogenation to produce high-octane isooctane. This
combination is called as a UOP indirect alkylation (InAlkTM) process.
2.1.3
FBD-4 process. Snamprogetti of FBD technology is
developed based on fluidized bed dehydrogenation, whose
core technology is the reaction–regeneration system, which is
operated in the fluidized bed. The catalyst is the basic metal
doped CrOx/Al2O3, and the propane conversion and propylene
selectivity are up to 45% and 80%, respectively.
The feed flow is that, first, the feed gas flows into the
reaction tower, and then the catalyst powder and product gas
are separated by the cyclone separator. Afterward, the product
gas is compressed and subsequently separated to obtain the
targeted propylene gas. Additionally, the catalyst with carbon
deposition on the surface is transported to the regeneration
tower (700 1C). The heat generated by the roasting is used as the
reactor heat source. The generated catalyst is then transferred to
the reaction tower for the next propane dehydrogenation cycle.
2.1.4
PDH process. The PDH process is partly derived from
Linde’s mature steam reforming technology, while the back
end of the process (product separation) is based on ethylene
technology established by Linde. The latest dehydrogenation
catalysts focus on platinum–tin catalysts with excellent selec-
tivity and activity. The multi-tube fixed bed reactor operates at
550–650 1C and catalysts are periodically regenerated with air.
Under isothermal operation, the process can achieve more
than 90% propylene selectivity. The catalyst life can exceed two
years due to the reduced coke accumulation and low deactiva-
tion rates. The high conversion rates and simple fixed-bed
reactor design result in less equipment and therefore less
investment. In addition, operating above atmospheric pressure
provides higher safety standards than other technologies.
2.1.5
STAR technology. Uhde, who acquired the STAR
process and catalyst technology from Phillips in 1999, enhanced
the process by adding the oxidative dehydrogenation portion from
a conventional reactor downstream. It is considered to be the
only propane/butane dehydrogenation technology that can use
the advantages of oxidative dehydrogenation. In the oxidative
dehydrogenation section, oxygen is introduced into the reactor,
where it reacts with some hydrogen products to form H2O. This
reverses the equilibrium of the dehydrogenation reaction, thus
increasing the conversion rate. In addition, the formation of
H2O is an exothermic reaction, thus providing additional heat
to the endothermic dehydrogenation reaction.
STAR catalyst (Pt–Sn on Zn–Ca aluminate) is based on zinc
aluminate and calcium supports, impregnated with various
metals, and exhibits excellent dehydrogenation performance,
and high selectivity at a nearly balanced conversion rate.24
The catalyst is very stable in the presence of steam at high
temperatures, providing a unique advantage to the process.
It has been commercially validated and shows a life span of
more than 5 years. Similar techniques can achieve acceptable
yields at pressures close to atmospheric pressure or even lower
(in a vacuum). The STAR process has the highest spatial yield of
all PDH technologies and operates at a reactor outlet pressure
of approximately 5.8 bar, allowing for a higher compressor
suction pressure, which significantly reduces the investment and
operating expenses associated with coarse gas compression.
2.1.6
ADHO technology. The China University of Petro-
leum announced the new propane/butane dehydrogenation
(ADHO) technology in 2016, which was successfully industria-
lized in Shandong Hengyuan Petrochemical Company Limited.
This dehydrogenation technology is operated with a non-toxic,
non-corrosive and non-noble metal oxide catalyst, in a highly
eﬃcient circulating fluidized bed reactor, and involves burning
the catalyst to regeneration for continuous dehydrogenation
reaction.
The ADHO technology has the following characteristics,
where raw materials do not need pretreatment and can be
directly fed into the reactor without desulfurization, dearseni-
fication and other complex technical processes.25 The reaction
and catalyst regeneration are carried out continuously with
high production eﬃciency. The catalyst is non-toxic with no
pollution to the environment and non-corrosive, and is con-
ducive to the safe and stable operation of the device over a long
period. Additionally, the catalyst exhibits high mechanical
strength and low agent consumption. It is not only suitable
for dehydrogenation of propane and butane alone, but also for
dehydrogenation of mixed propane and butane. The results of
the industrialization test in Shandong Hengyuan Petrochemical
Company Limited show that the single-pass conversion rates of
alkanes, and the yields and selectivities of alkenes are comparable
to the FBD-4 technology introduced in China, which fills the gap
in the field of this technology in China.
2.1.7
FCDh
process.
The
Dow
Chemical
Company
announced in October 2016 that it developed a fluidized
catalytic dehydrogenation (FCDh) technology to produce pro-
pylene from shale gas feedstock. It is operated in a circulating
fluid bed based on Fluid Catalytic Cracking (FCC) technology.26
The optimized catalysts coupled with appropriate dehydrogena-
tion and regeneration units achieve approximately 93% propylene
selectivity at about 45% propane conversion over K-promoted
PtGa/Al2O3 catalysts. Over 20% capital savings versus other
commercial technologies have been achieved largely because
of the simplicity of this system. Moreover, the energy demand
per pound of propylene is reduced due to the higher propane
conversion at moderate operating pressure.
In addition, the design uses robust reactor/catalyst regen-
erator technology that allows the process to be scaled as
needed. With a concept of using the catalyst to carry heat to
the reactor, lower energy requirements and lower CO2 emissions
come true. Besides, the FCDh technology applies a diﬀerent
method from the commercial technologies where the transport
of the deactivated catalysts between the dehydrogenation and
regeneration units is over shorter periods. This new technology
can be fully integrated with existing ethylene crackers in parallel

with new or existing furnaces, which can increase the production
of ethylene and propylene through an existing light hydrocarbon
facility or by building a new facility based on ethane and propane
feeds. Dow is currently promoting this technology on a commer-
cial scale in an existing cracker.
2.1.8
K-PROt technology. At the end of 2018, Houston-
based KBR reported a new propane dehydrogenation process,
K-PROt. The K-PROt technology is based on the commercially
proven KBR Catalytic Olefins Technology (K-COTt) in combi-
nation with a novel high selectivity dehydrogenation catalyst
free of precious metals and chromium.27 The technology can be
implemented as a stand-alone propylene production unit inde-
pendent of a steam cracker or an FCC unit. The regeneration is
Orthoflow FCC continuous regeneration. In the K-PROt reaction
section, fresh propane and recycled propane are fed into the KBR
Orthoflow Converter. Reaction section eﬄuent gas is then flowed
into the compressing unit, low temperature section, and subse-
quential PSA and purification sections. Notably, the K-COTt
reactor includes inherent continuous catalyst regeneration and
heat input.
In summary, at present, among these PDH technologies,
the Oleflex and Catofin processes have many sets of industrial
applications. The STAR process has just been on the way to
industrialization. However, the economical and/or environ-
mental issues caused by Pt-based and CrOx-based catalysts still
require further development. In the next section, we will trace
and introduce the development of PDH catalysts.
2.2
Catalyst development
In the PDH reactions, the activation of the first C–H bond of
propane is acknowledged as the rate-determining step which
determines the catalyst activity. While propylene is more active
and can more easily undergo complex side reactions, such as
further dehydrogenation and cracking. Based on the typical d
band and acid–base theory, the unsaturated filling of d orbitals
over transition metals and Lewis acid M–O sites over metal
oxides determine their PDH reactivity.28–35 In the past several
decades, a number of heterogeneous catalysts including metal-
based catalysts, metal oxide-based catalysts and non-oxide-
based catalysts in Fig. 5 (such as Pt, CrOx, VOx, GaOx, ZrO2,
carbides, nitrides, and carbon materials) have been exploited
for direct PDH reaction due to their affinity for paraffinic C–H
bonds and low activity to C–C cleavage that have exhibited high
performances. In this section, we will summarize the current
PDH catalysts and their application.
2.2.1
Metal-based catalysts
2.2.1.1 Pt-Based catalysts. Noble metals, such as Pt, are
active for propane dehydrogenation due to their aﬃnity for
paraﬃnic C–H bonds.36–39 The active component of Pt-based
catalysts is metal Pt cluster or nanocrystalline. Xing-Gui Zhou
and coworkers, using density functional theory (DFT), showed
that the dehydrogenation barrier and desorption barrier of
propylene on Pt(111) were similar, and the dehydrogenation
barrier (0.29 eV) on Pt(211) was much lower than the desorption
barrier of propylene (1.43 eV).33 Therefore, the main problems
of Pt particles are C–C cleavage and deep dehydrogenation
leading to coke formation. Meanwhile, high temperatures during
the dehydrogenation and regeneration induce severe sintering of
Pt nanoparticles mainly through the Ostwald ripening mechanism
(the Tammann temperature is 750 1C for platinum).10,39,40
Therefore, although the Pt catalyst shows excellent propane
dehydrogenation activity, its high tendency to coking and

sintering and high cost direct much attention to developing low
Pt content and modified Pt-based metal catalysts via promoter
(e.g. metal and oxide) and support (oxide and non-oxide) effects.
In this section, we will summarize the current Pt-based catalysts
in the aspects of promoters and supports.
2.2.1.1.1 Promoters. Metal promoters. Combining Pt with
other metals (M) to form alloys or Pt–M composites is an
efficient approach to enhancing the activity and selectivity as
well as lowering the Pt loading for PDH. Various metal promo-
ters, such as Sn,37,41 Zn,42,43 Cu,44,45 Fe,46,47 Co,48 Mn,49 In,50,51
Ga,52,53 V,54 and Ti,55 have often been chosen according to their
electronegativity, cost, toxicity and so forth (Fig. 6a). The
different preparation methods and metal loadings may contribute
to the different structures (Fig. 6b). Among them, a Pt–Sn
bimetallic catalyst shows good selectivity and stability, and
has received the most extensive attention. Regarding the roles
of Sn, researchers proposed the ‘‘geometric effect’’ and
‘‘electronic effect’’.56–58 On the one hand, some researchers
indicated that Sn additives help separate larger Pt ensembles into
smaller clusters, thus eliminating the sites for coke formation,
which is a structure-sensitive side reaction.41,59,60 On the other
hand, researchers believed that there is a strong electron transfer
between Sn and Pt atoms, making Pt atoms more electron-rich,
which promotes the desorption of propylene and coke transfer
from Pt sites to the support.61,62 Additionally, DFT calculations are
applied to reveal the influence of the Sn promoter for Pt-based
catalysts on dehydrogenation activity and selectivity. Yang et al.
found that the addition of the Sn promoter contributes to the
broadening of the d-band of Pt, which correspondingly downshifts
the d-band center of Pt on PtSn surfaces.37 Consequently, the PtSn
catalysts decrease the energy barrier for propylene desorption and
increase the activation energy for propylene dehydrogenation,
which lead to the promotion of propylene selectivity. In addition,
it has been recently demonstrated that the Sn species can help in
the redispersion of the Pt clusters in the regeneration operation.63
Although many studies have established the roles of Sn, the exact
active structures under reaction conditions are still under
continuing debates.60,64–67 The possible structures of PtSn/Al2O3
catalysts are shown in Fig. 7b. The debate details are summarized
as follows: (i) the chemical states of Sn, the metallic state,
oxidation state or coexistence of Sn0 and Snx+ (0 o x r 4),
(ii) the chemical states of Pt, (iii) coke mechanisms, and
(iv) redispersion behaviors in the regeneration process.
Oxide promoters. In addition to metallic promoters, metal
oxides have been employed as promoters, such as the oxides of
alkali metals,68,69 and rare earth metal oxides.70 The oxide pro-
moters could not only alter the coordination environment and
electronic state of metallic components which can be mediated by
the metal–oxide interactions, but induce neutralization of acid sites.71

For example, Gong and coworkers described that the addition of
titanium oxides helps in improving the catalytic performance of Pt
catalysts by the strong metal–support interaction between Pt and
TiO2.72 However, excessive TiO2 addition could increase the amount
of strong acid centers and lead to a significant amount of coke
formation. The induced metal–oxide interaction and undesired acid
sites exert an opposite influence on dehydrogenation performance.
Therefore, construable regulation of the interaction between Pt and
oxide promoters is crucial for PDH reactions.
2.2.1.1.2 Supports. In addition to promoters, good supports
for dehydrogenation of alkanes have to be thermally stable,
especially under harsh dehydrogenation and regeneration
conditions. Their textural properties such as specific surface
area, acid–base properties, and thermal stability have been
demonstrated to have significant influences on the catalytic
performance of Pt-based catalysts. For example, to avert the
occurrence of undesirable coke and alkane isomerization on
supports, the support acidity should be carefully controlled.
Additionally, to increase the dispersion of metal particles,
supports with high surface area and uniform pore size distribu-
tion are preferred. Numerous kinds of supports have been
employed, such as oxide or non-oxide supports, including
Al2O3,63,73 CeO2,74 SiO2,75,76 spinel MgAl2O4 (or ZnAl2O4),57,77
zeolites,78,79 carbon materials41 and so on.
Oxide supports. Metal oxide supported Pt catalysts have
been shown to be eﬀective in PDH reactions. Alumina has been
most widely used as a catalyst support due to its large specific
surface area, suitable mechanical strength, high thermal
conductivity, excellent thermal stability and competitive price.
For instance, Al2O3 supported PtSn catalyst is commonly used.
Nevertheless, the reaction performance is still not satisfactory,
especially regarding the stability of the catalyst due to its
unsuitable support acidity. As a consequence, during the
process of dehydrogenation reaction, the use of modified
Al2O3 and alternative supports has attracted a great deal of
attention. Some alkaline metals, such as Li, Na, and K, can help
poison the strong acid sites and avoid the coke deposition on
the Al2O3 surface. Additionally, doping Mg into Al2O3 forms a
stable spinel phase. Wan-Zhong Lang and coworkers investi-
gated the influence of diﬀerent Mg/Al molar ratios in Mg(Al)O-x
materials as supports for PtIn/Mg(Al)O-x catalysts. The results
showed that the supports with a Mg/Al molar ratio of 4 : 1
exhibited the best dehydrogenation performance.51 In addition,
the amount of coordinatively unsaturated penta-coordinate Al
atoms on the surface of Al2O3 can also have a great impact on
the catalytic properties.80 An-Hui Lu and coworkers indicated
that Al2O3 nanosheets with abundant penta-coordinate Al
atoms have a strong metal–support interaction owing to their
capacity for anchoring Pt atoms, which accounts for their high
stability.73
In addition to Al2O3-based supports, other oxide supports
such SiO2, CeO2 and zeolites have been further developed. Due
to the weak interaction between Pt and SiO2, Pt-based bimetals
with high alloying degrees such as PtM intermetallic alloys can
be formed by direct H2 pretreatment on SiO2 supports.81
Comparatively, there exist strong interactions between CeO2
and metal particles, where Pt atoms can be trapped in the form
of Pt ions. During the regeneration step, the CeO2 support can
help facilitate atomic redispersion of Pt clusters without using
corrosive halogens. Additionally, upon using water vapor, the
coke deposition could be eliminated accounting for the redox

properties of CeO2 under propane dehydrogenation.82 Addi-
tionally, Pt can be embedded in zeolites with special three-
dimensional channels such as Pt@KA (LTA-type zeolite) and
Pt@ZSM-5
(MFI-type
zeolite) with
some
unique physical
properties.43,83,84 The adjustable Si/Al ratios and relatively large
surface areas can hinder the formation of large hydrocarbon
molecules, thus preventing the so-called coke deposits and
improving the catalytic stability. Besides, some mesoporous
materials, such as SBA-1561 and MCM-41,78 are often used as
the catalyst supports to disperse the active phase with more
active sites and less coke deposition.
Non-oxide supports. In addition to oxide supports, some non-
oxide-based supports such as carbides and carbon materials are
applied. Two-dimensional (2D) early transition metal carbides,
i.e., MXenes, due to their well-defined structures and tunable
compositions have attracted much attention. Yue Wu and
coworkers reported thermally stable Pt3Ti intermetallic com-
pounds prepared via reactive metal–support interactions (RMSI)
between platinum and MXenes.55 Additionally, carbon materials
have been widely used for plenty of reactions because of their
large surface area, chemical inertness and stability in acidic/basic
media. Novel nanostructured carbon materials including carbon
nanotubes and graphene as supports have been gradually
developed. Zhen Zhao and coworkers found that graphene doped
with pyridine nitrogen is predicted to be the most effective
support for enhancing Pt catalytic performance.85
Obviously, each specific support has its own characteristic
and may exhibit a distinctive eﬀect on the catalytic property.
It can not only change the selectivity by influencing the
component, morphology and distribution of metal particles
but also alter the reaction stability by increasing mechanical
strength, anti-sintering and anti-coking resistance.
An overview of Pt-based dehydrogenation catalysts with
specific promoters and supports, including reaction conditions,
propane conversion, propylene selectivity, propylene formation
and deactivation rates, is provided in Table 2. The comparison of
the diﬀerent catalysts is based on the propylene formation rate,
which is defined as the moles of C3H6 formed per gram of Pt per
hour at the start of the dehydrogenation reaction as a function of
the deactivation rate. Because of propane dehydrogenation as a
structure-insensitive reaction, all Pt atoms on the surface are
active for propane dehydrogenation. It is diﬃcult to calculate
the turnover frequency (TOF) because Pt dispersion values in
diﬀerent catalysts were not given. Additionally, to determine the
stability of diﬀerent catalysts, we calculated the deactivation
rate (kd), based on a first-order deactivation mechanism. The
propylene formation rate as a function of the deactivation rate
for the representative Pt-based catalysts is shown in Fig. 8. We can
find that the propylene formation rates of the most Pt-based
catalysts are about 5 mol gpt
1 h1 at the deactivation rate of
0.05 h1. However, the catalysts life and Pt loadings are 10 h
and 0.5–1 wt% in the references, which are far away from the
industrial application.
2.2.1.2 Other metal-based catalysts. Due to the high cost and
high tendency to deactivation of Pt catalysts, the development
of non-noble based catalysts (e.g. Ni-, Fe- and Co-based cata-
lysts) has attracted much attention. Recently, a Ni-based
catalyst has been acknowledged as a candidate for propane
dehydrogenation. Compared with Pt, Ni-based catalysts are of
lower cost. Yan et al. reported Ni/SiO2 catalysts for propane
dehydrogenation.86 Despite the high reactivity and propane
conversion in Ni/SiO2, CH4 was one of the main side products
due to the existence of C–C bond cleavage, which suppresses
the propylene selectivity.87 Moreover, significant deactivation
over Ni/SiO2 catalysts was observed because of coke formation
and accumulation during propane dehydrogenation. Compared
with Ni catalysts, Fe-based and Co-based catalysts have been
studied due to their earth abundance and relatively low toxicity.
Lobo et al. investigated Fe-substituted ZSM-5 for non-oxidative
PDH, achieving 78–85% propylene selectivity with a very moderate
conversion (3.6%).88 Importantly, the reduced Fe species would
transform into an iron carbide phase, leading to the instability of
active sites.89
2.2.2
Metal oxide-based catalysts. Diﬀering from metal-
based catalysts, the Lewis acid M–O sites in metal oxides can
also effectively activate the propane C–H bonds. A series of bulk
and supported metal oxide catalysts (such as CrOx, VOx, GaOx
and ZrO2) have been extensively employed in PDH reactions.
They show considerable activity and propylene selectivity, yet
suffer from the loss of oxygen under reaction conditions, and
rapid deactivation. Over the course of a catalytic cycle, due to
the coke deposition, frequent regeneration operations are
needed. Although the catalysts recover most of their activity
after each reaction–regeneration cycle, the loss of activity due to
regeneration sintering is not entirely reversible. In this section,
we will emphatically summarize the widely studied CrOx, VOx,
GaOx and ZrO2-based catalysts, as well as other metal oxide-
based catalysts.
2.2.2.1 CrOx-based catalysts. Chromium oxides are commonly
used in PDH, and are applied in the commercialized Catofin and
FBD-4 processes. The reaction of alkane molecules occurs at the
Cr–O sites. However, compared with Pt, chromium oxide is more
complex and it is difficult to explain the reaction and deactivation
mechanism. In terms of the fresh chrome oxide catalyst, there are
a variety of chromium ions with different valence states, including
Cr6+, Cr5+, Cr3+, and Cr2+, which play different roles in the PDH
process.90,91 As dehydrogenation reaction is in a strongly reducing
atmosphere, the high valence state chromium ions would be
reduced in the reaction process. Using in situ X-ray absorption
near edge structure (XANES) and UV-vis spectra, Sattler and
coworkers found the reduction of Cr6+ to Cr3+ at the beginning
of the dehydrogenation reaction and that the Cr3+ is generally
considered to be the active site (Fig. 7a).92
Carbon deposition and Cr3+ aggregation are the main deactiva-
tion causes of chromium oxide. At the beginning of the reaction,
the carbon rapidly accumulates on the chromium oxide surface.
As the reaction progresses, the reaction rate becomes slower,
leading to a slower rate of coke formation. Therefore, industrial
chromium-based
catalysts
need
to
be
recycled
frequently.
In addition, due to the similar ionic radius of Al3+ and Cr3+,

Cr3+ will diﬀuse into the Al2O3 lattice, leading to the formation of
a spinel phase, and thus the loss of activity.93,94 At the same time,
chrome oxide would collapse and aggregate during the redox
cycles.
In short, CrOx-based catalysts have high reactivity and selectivity,
but low stability, with about 1 mol gCr
1 h1 or 1 mol gcat
1 h1 at
the deactivation rate of 0.5 h1 (Fig. 9 and Table 3), as well as high
toxicity. Therefore, low toxicity and stable alternative catalysts are
increasingly desired.
2.2.2.2 VOx-based catalysts. A supported vanadium oxide
catalyst is expected to be used for PDH. There are a large
number of studies on vanadium-based catalysts, and most of
them concentrate on oxidative dehydrogenation. However, a
low olefin selectivity is the major issue due to the overoxida-
tion to COx.95,96 Comparatively, high olefin selectivity can be
achieved via a direct dehydrogenation process over vanadium
oxides. Sokolov et al. made a comparison between VOx, CrOx,
and PtSn catalysts and they found that VOx-based catalysts
showed more superior propylene selectivity and stability during
continuous regeneration cycles. Before the dehydrogenation
reaction, V5+ is the main species, while it would be partially
reduced to V4+ and V3+ during H2 pretreatment. Therefore,
various V species including V5+, V4+, and V3+ coexist in
vanadium-based catalysts.97 Gong and coworkers investigated
the nature of active species by adjusting the V loadings on Al2O3
supports to obtain various ratios of V5+, V4+, and V3+ species. They
found a close relationship between TOF and the concentration of
V3+ ions, which were identified as the most active sites for propane
dehydrogenation among the V5+, V4+, and V3+ ions.98
Similar to CrOx-based catalysts, carbon deposition is the
main reason for deactivation of VOx-based catalysts, which is
intimately related to the dispersion of VOx species.97 Evgenii
V. Kondratenko and coworkers found that regardless of
supports for VOx-based catalysts, the coke deposition on VOx
is more severe than that over the acid sites on supports.99,100
Additionally, there exists a positive relationship between the rate
constant of coke formation and the polymerization degree of VOx
species, where highly polymerized three-dimensional V2O5 nano-
particles (3D V2O5) result in more significant coke formation
compared with low-polymerization-degree VOx species such as
monovanadates and polyvanadates.
In short, VOx-based catalysts have high reactivity and sup-
pressed deactivation rates compared with CrOx-based catalysts,
with about 0.3 mol gV
1 h1 at the deactivation rate of 0.2 h1
(Fig. 9 and Table 4). However, numerous V species exist on
VOx-based
catalysts,
including
V5+,
V4+,
V3+,
isolated
V,
oligomeric Vn+, and crystalline V2O5. Which V species are
responsible for propane activation and selective propylene
production is still unclear. In addition, the toxicity of VOx also
limits their application in the industrial process.
2.2.2.3 GaOx-based catalysts. In addition to CrOx- and
VOx-based catalysts, GaOx-based catalysts have been studied for
PDH reaction for years. Both of the bulk and supported GaOx
are active and more stable for PDH, with about 0.1 mol gGa
1 h1
or 0.1 mol gcat
1 h1at the low deactivation rate of 0.03 h1 (Fig. 9
and Table 5). However, the active sites of Ga have been debated
Fig. 9
Comparisons of propylene formation rates as a function of deac-
tivation rate over metal oxide-based catalysts. Normalized activities of the
formation rate of C3H6 by specific content of M (Cr, V, Ga, In, Zn, Mo, Fe,
and Co) as a function of deactivation rate for the catalysts described in the
literature (see Tables 3–11). A first-order deactivation model is usually used
to evaluate the catalyst stability. The number labeled with e represents that
the formation rate of C3H6 is normalized as the unit of mol C3H6 gmetal
1 h1.
A, B, C and D represent 4 different regions with different performances. For
example, in region A, higher propylene formation rates and lower deactivation
rates are obtained. Comparatively, in region D, lower propylene formation
rates and higher deactivation rates are obtained.

tivation rate over Pt-based catalysts. Normalized activities of the formation

the catalysts described in the literature (see Table 2). A first-order deac-
tivation model is usually used to evaluate the catalyst stability. A, B, C and D
represent 4 diﬀerent regions with diﬀerent performances. For example, in
region A, higher propylene formation rates and lower deactivation rates
are obtained. Comparatively, in region D, lower propylene formation rates
and higher deactivation rates are obtained.

and strongly aﬀected by the types of supports, preparation
methods, and loading amounts.101 Studies have shown that
the active site of Ga2O3 is the Lewis acid site provided by
coordinatively unsaturated Ga3+.102,103 The high activity of
b-Ga2O3 is due to its monoclinic structure, where Ga3+ ions
are evenly distributed on the octahedron and tetrahedron,
which can provide a large number of weak acid sites. The
DFT calculation on Ga2O3(100) shows that the activation of
propane on the surface of Ga2O3 is first caused by the loss of
one hydrogen of the propane molecule to form a propyl group
and a hydroxyl group, and then the removal of b-H to form
another hydroxyl group.104 But it takes much energy to get rid
of these two hydroxyl groups to form H2O or H2, and the latter
takes a lot more energy. So it is thought that the diﬃculty of the
desorption step of the adsorbed hydrogen atoms limits the
activity of Ga2O3.
Many eﬀorts have been made to improve the activity of
GaOx-based catalysts. Doping can eﬀectively increase the activity
by increasing the number of coordinatively unsaturated Ga3+ sites.
Recently, Sattler et al. reported trace Pt modified GaOx as eﬃcient
catalysts for propane dehydrogenation.105 They found that the
promoter of Pt helps in facilitating hydrogen desorption and
recovering the gallium hydride and/or hydroxide species.
In addition, H2 pretreatment can promote the formation of
Ga–H species, which are more active than H+ sites and Ga+
sites.102,106
Furthermore, GaOx-based catalysts suﬀer from significant
sintering during the continuous regeneration operations.107
Therefore, controlled regeneration is highly desired to recover
their performance.
2.2.2.4 ZrO2-based catalysts. Recently, eco-friendly and cost-
eﬃcient catalysts on the basis of ZrO2 and modified ZrO2-based
catalysts have been developed (Table 6). Coordinatively unsa-
turated Zr (Zrcus) and neighboring lattice oxygen are suggested
to participate in PDH.108,109 DFT calculations predict that Zrcus
cations in the lattice of ZrO2 lower the activation barrier of H2
and C3H6 formation from C3H8 by 0.76 eV in comparison with
their saturated counterparts (2 eV versus 1.24 eV). Two Zrcus
sites directly participate in alkane activation, while lattice
oxygen and zirconium cations are required for C–H bond
activation on the stoichiometric surface.109
By altering the particle size and crystalline phase, the
concentration of Zrcus cations can be significantly tuned.110,111
Additionally, doping and pretreating with a reductive atmosphere
can be the eﬀective methods for generating Zrcus cations. For
example, doping of Y2O3 oxides is eﬀective in generating and
increasing the Zrcus sites with higher dehydrogenation activity.109
Additionally, the addition of noble metals such as Rh nano-
clusters has a large impact on the reducibility of zirconia.112 Also,
Rh nanoclusters help in promoting hydrogen desorption and
decreasing the energy barrier in PDH reaction over bare ZrO2.113
Additionally, H2 pretreatment leads to an increase of
Zrcus sites, which accordingly increases the PDH performance.
Although ZrO2 with Zrcus showed superior dehydrogenation
activity, over-reduction should be carefully avoided. For example,

as for the Rh/ZrO2 catalyst, when the reduction degree of ZrO2
increases, propylene can adsorb onto Rh strongly, leading to the
blockage of the hydrogen recombination site.113 The promoting
eﬀect of the metal is therefore hindered. In addition, the bulk
ZrO2 showed significant limitations of deactivation for carbon
deposit in the dehydrogenation step and sintering in redox cycles.
Therefore, the development of ZrO2-based catalysts remains a
great challenge.

(Table 9) Fe-based (Table 10), Co-based (Table 11) catalysts and so
forth have been studied. However, the activity and propylene
selectivity need to be further improved. Most importantly, the
catalyst stability during the dehydrogenation and regeneration
processes should be extensively promoted.
In the direct comparisons in Fig. 9, there are 4 regions (A, B,
C and D), and we can find that although CrOx- and VOx-based
catalysts, in region B, show higher propylene formation rates,
they suﬀer higher deactivation rates. Comparatively, some
metal oxides in regions C and D such as InOx-based catalysts
show relatively lower activity. Importantly, GaOx-based cata-
lysts, in region A, show preferable formation rates at lower
deactivation rates, and might be promising alternative PDH
catalysts. However, we should note that compared with noble
Pt-based catalysts the propylene formation rates are limited due
to their low reactivity; therefore, further improving the ability of
C–H activation remains the most important orientation for
metal oxide-based catalysts.

2.2.3
Other formulations. In addition to metals and metal
oxides, the modern green chemical industry has made urgent
and strict demands for environmentally and economically
friendly catalysts, which has seriously restricted the large scale
applications of conventional metal-based catalysts, especially pre-
cious metal and toxic metal oxides. Alternative carbon-based
materials and carbides and nitrides have been investigated widely.
2.2.3.1 Carbon materials. Carbon was first found to exhibit
catalytic activity in alkane dehydrogenation reactions in the
1970s, and the rapid development of nanocarbon materials
at the end of the last century provides ideal platforms for
catalysis.114 The tunable surface functionalities and the relatively
large p-conjugation systems provide nanocarbon materials stable
catalytic activity in dehydrogenation of alkanes. Figueiredo’s
group found that oxygen functionalities on activated carbon
and carbon nanofibers (CNFs) are possible active sites for alkane
oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) reactions.115 Recently, non-
precious metals confined in a nitrogen-containing carbon matrix
(M–N–C) were developed.116 The N-coordinated Co(II) sites were
very stable up to 750 K under a H2 atmosphere and active for
propane dehydrogenation.
2.2.3.1 Transition metal carbides and nitrides. Transition
metal carbides and nitrides are produced by incorporating C
and N atoms into the interstitial sites of transition metals and
the formation of carbides and nitrides can significantly modify
the physical and chemical properties of the parent metals.117
From the point of view of catalysis, transition metal carbides
(TMCs) often demonstrate unique catalytic properties as noble
metal Pt catalysts. For PDH reaction, propylene selectivities
495% can be achieved in the absence of H2.118 However, due to
their limited surface areas and unclear deactivation mechan-
isms, the development of these catalysts is desired.
3. Fundamentals of catalyst design
Although it is generally accepted that numerous metal-based
and metal oxide-based catalysts show superior activity and
selectivity and have been widely developed, it is still unclear
and ambiguous as to which active site structures and dehydro-
genation mechanisms are followed in the PDH process from a
fundamental perspective. In the propane dehydrogenation
system, it is of vital importance to understand the relationship
between active-site motifs and unique catalytic behaviors,
including dehydrogenation pathways and deactivation mechan-
isms, which can shine a light on precise catalyst design. In this
section, the active sites, dehydrogenation pathways and deac-
tivation mechanisms on Pt-based and representative metal
oxide-based catalysts would be clarified.
3.1
Active sites, dehydrogenation pathways and deactivation
mechanisms over Pt-based catalysts
3.1.1
Active sites. Based on the above catalyst development
and performance comparisons, Pt-based catalysts show very
high PDH reactivity. A previous study demonstrated that Pt-
based catalysts are active for dehydrogenation in the metallic
state, particularly due to their aﬃnity for paraﬃnic C–H bonds.
Propane dehydrogenation is a structure-insensitive reaction,
for which the kinetics is independent of the particle size of Pt
clusters. Assuming that every surface atom is an active site, its
reaction rate is directly proportional to the dispersion.119
Although small particles are inclined to increasing the mount
of active sites on the surface, the relative fraction of exposed

atoms with different local environments is also diverse.
Since side reactions like deep dehydrogenation of propylene
and propane hydrogenolysis are structure-sensitive reactions,
undesired products are inevitably formed, which result in
catalyst deactivation. The fraction of certain active sites can be
calculated from geometric models,120 which predict that the
fraction of under-coordinated atoms (local metal coordination
numbers o 7) increases from B0.15 to B1 with metal particles
shrinking from B10 to B1 nm. Lower dehydrogenation energy
barrier on Pt nanoparticles which exposed (211) on surface,
leads to a higher activity.39 In contrast, Pt nanoparticles which
exposed (111) have a higher cracking energy barrier and lower
binding energy in propylene, resulting in a more favorable
selectivity (Fig. 10b). The Pt(111) surface consists of four differ-
ent sites: atop, bridge, fcc hollow and hcp hollow (Fig. 10a).9
Surface structures for the adsorption of propylene on Pt(111)
are of four types: (i) propylene di-s V-shape; (ii) propylene di-s;
(iii)
propylene
p
and
(iv)
propylidyne
(Fig.
10c).121
The
different adsorption configurations reflect the influence of Pt
geometric sites.
Experimentally, adsorption of propane and propene was

complex, this would have Cs symmetry with only the a0 modes
allowed by the MSSR. These are, respectively, n(CH3)as, n(CH3)s,
n(CH2)s, d(CH3)as, d(CH3)s, d(CH2) (scissors), CH2 wag, CH3
rock and two n(CC) modes. Other mode components of
n(CH3)as, d(CH3)as and CH3 rock, together with n(CH2)as,
CH2 twist and CH2 rock have a00 symmetry and are forbidden
by the ‘‘metal-surface selection rule’’ (MSSR). For the room-
temperature spectrum of propane and propene over Pt/SiO2, only
additional weak absorptions occur at 2895, 1365 and 1355 cm1
together with a relative intensification of the band at 2920 cm1.122
All these additional features are strengthened in the spectrum from
the adsorption of propene, and additional weak bands occur at
3020–2980, 2820 and 1465 cm1. The 3020–2980 cm1 absorptions
clearly arise from the n(CH) modes of the C–C group in the p-
complex, but their weakness suggests that relatively few of these
species are present. Additionally no band assignable to the n(C
Q
C)
mode of the p-complex has been observed in this case. It therefore
seems probable that the di-s species is the most abundant addi-
tional species after propylidyne.
Another issue is about the valence states of Pt (Pt0 or Ptx+),
which have a great impact on the reactivity of propane conver-
sion. A typical example can be found in the work of Xiong
et al.,124 who reported that the conversion of propane is up to
100% with Pt atoms singly dispersed on CeO2,74 where Pt atoms
have been acknowledged to be bonded onto CeO2 via the
combination of [Pt2+O4] single atoms.125 However, it enhances
the interaction between all intermediates of CxHy and Pt
because the –CxHy group is electron-rich, and thus electrophilic
sites on the catalyst will attract the adsorption of the –CxHy
group. Therefore, Ptx+ ions are not selective for propylene pro-
duction but merely convert propane with excellence. Recently,
Gong and coworkers126 showed that single-atom and electron-
rich Pt on Cu metals showed more facile propylene desorption
and a higher propylene deep dehydrogenation barrier than Pt
metals, leading to higher propylene selectivity but at the expense
of dehydrogenation activity with a higher first dehydrogenation
barrier. This could imply that electron-rich Pt atoms are selective
but less reactive for propane dehydrogenation to propylene, which
is in accordance with the above discussion.
Therefore, every Pt surface atom is active for propane
dehydrogenation, but the geometrically coordinated structure

3.1.2
Dehydrogenation pathways. Based on the identifi-
cation of specific active site structures, a variety of experimental
and theoretical studies have been performed to understand the
dehydrogenation pathways on Pt catalysts. In propane dehydro-
genation, the reactions generally occur in four steps: reactant
adsorption,
surface
reaction
(first
and
second
hydrogen
abstraction), propylene desorption, and site regeneration.9
Xing-Gui Zhou and coworkers33,127,128 investigated the succes-
sive dehydrogenation and cracking of propane on Pt(111),
Pt(100) and Pt(211) surfaces, consisting of 17 elementary dehy-
drogenation steps and 11 C–C bond cracking steps (Fig. 11a
and b). Compared with Pt(100) and Pt(211), Pt(111) is more
selective toward propylene for its higher cracking energy barrier
and weakens the binding strength of propylene, suggested by
DFT calculations and experiments. It’s worth noting that the
activation energy is not constant with the progression of the

continuous
deep
dehydrogenation.
The
activation
energy
differences between the elementary steps of cracking and
dehydrogenation are considerably reduced. And the inter-
mediate derived from deep dehydrogenation, propyne, is
supposed to be the point of origin of C–C bond breaking,
as the C–C bond cleavage is easier than C–H bond breaking,
contributing to the formation of side products like ethane,
methane and coke. Su and coworkers9 also gave a complete
description of the reaction pathway of dehydrogenation to
propylene, deep dehydrogenation, and C–C bond cracking on
a Pt(111) surface, showing that the rate-limiting step is the
dissociative adsorption of propane. Pathway R2 - R5 plays a
dominant role in transforming C3H8 to C3H6 compared with
R1 - R4, while R6 - R11 and R10 contribute to the cracking
of C3 species (Fig. 11c). Different from the common slab
models, Luo and coworkers129 systematically investigated
propane dehydrogenation over a single-Pd-doped Cu55 nano-
particle. The first C–H bond activation is still the rate-
determining step for the whole reaction, as the slab model
showed, and the barriers for the initial C–H cracking to yield
1-propyl and 2-propyl species are similar, which are 102.0 and
103.3 mol1, respectively (Fig. 11d, e and h).
Previous research studies by Chen et al. and Honkala et al.
demonstrated that the competition between C3H6 desorption and
C3H6 dehydrogenation can be used to evaluate the selectivity.29,130
Therein, they used a simplified network to study propylene
dehydrogenation, and the energy barriers to yield 1-propenyl
and
2-propenyl
species
are
112.1
and
138.0
kJ
mol1,
respectively, which are 53.5 and 79.5 kJ mol1 higher than that
of the propylene desorption, making the desorption of propy-
lene more favorable dynamically (Fig. 11f and h). Typically, the
adsorption configuration of propylene has transferred from
the di-s to p mode on the Pt single atoms, compared to the
co-existence of two modes on the Pt surfaces (Fig. 11g).
Recently, Gong and coworkers131 further investigated the per-
formance of Pt-based alloy catalysts using a-type (1) and b-type
(2) PDH reactions (the diﬀusion of H is not included) (Fig. 11h).
The surface propylene either desorbs to form gas phase propy-
lene or further dehydrogenates and the dehydrogenation pro-
duct of propylene (C3H5*) is taken as a model precursor for
coke deposition. The authors utilized the free energy barrier of
the first dehydrogenation step to represent the activity of the
PDH catalyst as numerous studies have suggested that the first
or second C–H bond cleavage of alkanes is the rate-controlling
step. Moreover, they applied a descriptor, namely, the differ-
ence between the C3H6 desorption free energy barrier and the
further dehydrogenation free energy barrier from C3H6 to
1-C3H5, to roughly represent the selectivity. Nearly 30 different
bimetallic compounds for the PDH reaction are tested and the
linear relationship indicates that the selectivity will decrease
with the increase of activity, as derived from the Brønsted–
Evans–Polanyi (BEP) relationship.132
3.1.3
Deactivation
mechanisms.
As
discussed
above,
propane dehydrogenation undergoes a very complex dehydro-
genation network. Particularly, at high temperatures, parasitic
reactions (such as cracking and hydrogenolysis to lighter
hydrocarbons, further dehydrogenation and formation of coke
deposits) lead to rapid loss of activity and lower yields over
Pt-based catalysts. Notably, the primary cause of catalyst deac-
tivation is coke formation. Coke preferentially covers the
surface uncoordinated active sites, which might be the possible
reason why the activity tends to decrease more rapidly on
smaller nanoparticles. In addition, the high reaction and
regeneration temperatures can also lead to the sintering of Pt
NPs, leaching and reconstruction deactivation of PtM alloys.
The main forms of deactivation are shown in Fig. 12a.
A first-order deactivation model is usually used to evaluate
the catalyst stability:73
kd = (ln[(1  Xfinal)/Xfinal]  ln[(1  Xinitial)/Xinitial])/t
(6)
where Xinitial represents the conversion measured in the initial
period, Xfinal represents the conversion measured in the final
period of an experiment, and t is the reaction time (h).
kd represents the deactivation rate constant (h1); the higher
the kd value is, the faster deactivation and lower stability are
realized. Insights into the deactivation mechanisms can further
help design more stable Pt-based catalysts. The aforementioned
deactivation phenomena have a crucial influence on the cata-
lytic performance. Therefore, for the design of catalytic systems
with promoted performance, inhibition of deactivation can serve
as an important requirement. A number of synthetic strategies
for inhibiting the deactivation have been shown, which can be
classified in accordance with the modification of supports,
metals and treatments (Fig. 12b). In the following sections, we

will introduce the deactivation mechanisms and the inhibition
strategies.
3.1.3.1 Coke formation
3.1.3.1.1 Coking mechanism. In PDH reactions, coking
behavior over Pt-based catalysts leads to decreased catalytic
activity follows via two mechanisms: poisoning the active sites
or limiting access of the reactants to the active sites due to the
partial or complete blockage of pores by coke.133,134 Both
deactivation modes can occur simultaneously. As shown above,
the coordination saturated Pt atoms are more selective for
propane dehydrogenation, while the coordinatively unsatu-
rated Pt atoms will catalyze the side reactions, such as C–C
breaking and deep dehydrogenation, resulting in the formation
of carbon deposits. It has been reported that compared to flat
surfaces (63–72 kJ mol1), the energy barrier to form propylene
is much lower on step sites (24–34 kJ mol1) by DFT
calculations.134 Nevertheless, propylidyne intermediates, as
precursors for coke formation and hydrogenolysis, can be easily
generated, causing propane to adsorb strongly on the former.
The dehydrogenation product of propylene, C3H5*, can be
taken as a model precursor for coke deposition. In addition
to the coke formation on Pt NPs, the coke types and positions
on Pt-supported catalysts have been studied, which are classi-
fied into three locations: on Pt metal, on the Pt–support
boundary, and on supports. For Pt/Al2O3 and Pt–Sn/Al2O3
catalysts, coked during propane dehydrogenation, have been
studied using temperature-programmed oxidation (TPO). TPO
profiles on the Pt–Sn catalyst imply that different peaks are
consistent with coke on and near the metal, graphitic and
disordered coke on the support, respectively. The amount of
coke that can be attributed to the third peak increases with
temperature and propane partial pressure.133
Both facilitating the propylene desorption and increasing
the dehydrogenation barrier of propylene result in less coke.
As the adsorption configuration and strength of propylene can
be both greatly perturbed by surface structures, coke formation
is inherently governed by the surface geometric and electronic
structures, and thus the construction of specific reaction
ensembles is important. Additionally, tuning the support’s
acidity and coke mobility can also inhibit the coke formation.
Understanding the process of coke deposition on the catalysts
is important in improving catalyst performance and optimizing
catalyst regeneration. The eﬀective strategies for inhibiting
coke are summarized as follows.
3.1.3.1.2 Geometric separation. Previous research studies
have shown that separating the active metal components could
inhibit the structure-sensitive side reactions with improved
propylene selectivity. For example, Gong and coworkers described
an investigation of the promotional eﬀect of Cu on the catalytic
performance of Pt/Al2O3 catalysts for PDH.44 The interaction
between Pt and Cu elevates the energy barrier for C–C bond
breaking, and facilitates C3H6 desorption as well. The optimized
loading content of Cu is 0.5 wt%, which increases the C3H6 yield
to 36.5% with a C3H6 selectivity of 90.8% and less coke (Fig. 13a
and b). Specifically, owing to the site-isolated Pt, C3H5 as a model
precursor of coke formation can only contact with its surface
through a single bond instead of more stable three Pt–C inter-
actions on a 3-fold hollow site over Pt(111), which can significantly
inhibit the
structure-sensitive
deep
dehydrogenation
side
reactions. For example, Pt/Cu single-atom alloys (SAAs) break
the scaling relationship of Pt3M (M = 3d and 4d transition metals)
alloys and eliminate the structure-sensitive deep dehydrogenation
to improve the propylene selectivity up to 90%.45,135 In regard to
the significance of isolated active sites (i.e., geometric effects), a
similar inference has been implied for PdIn/SiO2 intermetallic
alloys in ethane dehydrogenation (EDH).136
3.1.3.1.3 Electron richness. As mentioned above, the empty
d orbital of Pt can be occupied by electrons transferred from
electron-rich C3H6 which acts as an electron-donor. A high
electron density of Pt particles is beneficial to weaken Pt–(C–C)
bonds, inhibit coke precursors, and suppress deep dehydrogena-
tion and C–C cleavage as well, thus promoting desorption of
C3H6, leading to a favorable C3H6 selectivity. Since the reactivity
of metal nanoparticle surfaces is determined by the electronic
states through the valence d-bands, which is a region in the
partial density of states (DOS) (Fig. 13c),42 alloying with diverse
promoters have a great impact on the energies and availability of
the valence electrons to form chemical bonds with adsorbates,
which is a feasible way to modulate the surface electronic
structure and hence the reactivity. Jeffrey Greeley and coworkers
applied an integrated approach using DFT calculations, kinetics,
and in situ X-ray spectroscopies. The modified energy of the Pt 5d
electrons by the amalgamation of Zn into the catalyst surface
is directly related to transformation of rate promotion, while
the ensemble effects of PtZn ensembles contribute to enhanced
C3H6 selectivity (Fig. 13d).42 In addition to the alloys, the
addition of an appropriate amount of reducible metal oxides
such as TiO2 improves catalytic stability and C3H6 selectivity,
which is attributed to the electron transfer from partially
reduced TiOx (x o 2) to Pt atoms.72
3.1.3.1.4 Poisoning acid sites. In addition to the coke on
metal particles, the coke on acidic supports can also suppress
the diﬀusion of reactive molecules. Another approach has been
the use of non-acidic supports that lead to fewer cracking and
polymerization
reactions
compared
with
acidic
supports.
Alumina is a conventional support applied to platinum-based
catalysts for dehydrogenation due to its high surface area,
outstanding mechanical strength and thermal stability, which
is beneficial to disperse platinum clusters on surfaces and thus
enhance the stability of the catalyst. However, most alumina
supports are acidic, which tends to accelerate coke formation;
therefore alkaline promoters are used to poison acid sites and
curb support acidity, such as Li, Na, and K. Zn and Mg with
diﬀerent ratios have also been used to dope the support
(Fig. 13e), where the samples with a Zn/(Zn+Mg) of 0.05 showed
the highest propylene selectivity (Fig. 13f),137 because the
resulting spinel phase is less acidic and thermally more stable.
Another way to modify an Al2O3 support is to introduce metal
oxides (such as TiO2, and CeO2) into it. Due to the enhanced
interaction between Pt and the supports, the activity, stability

and anti-coking capability of Pt-based catalysts would be
improved to a large extent. This kind of modification decreases
the acidity of supports, and modulates the dispersion and the
electronic properties of Pt.
3.1.3.1.5 Co-feeding streams. In addition to the modulation
of catalyst structures and the properties of supports, changes in
reaction conditions by cofeeding streams, such as H2, and CO2,
can also have a positive eﬀect on coke elimination. Increasing
hydrogen pressure leads to a lower coverage of deeply dehy-
drogenated coke precursors on the surface (Fig. 13g).138 More
recent experiments show that an increasing TOF of propylene
during propane dehydrogenation is observed with increasing
H2/C3H8 inlet ratio (Fig. 13h). Several explanations are suggested:
(i) H2 reduces the coverage of coke precursors, (ii) reaction
energies and barriers depend on H2 coverage in a beneficial
way, (iii) an alternative and energetically favorable reaction
pathway exists at increased H2 coverage and (iv) subsurface
hydrogen that may have emerged at high H2 coverage has an
eﬀect. In addition to H2, cofeeding CO2 is an attractive method,
where CO2 acts as a soft oxidant, and can reduce the amount of
coke formed at elevated temperature on the catalysts via the
reverse Boudouard reaction, thereby increasing conversion and
maintaining the stability of the catalysts.139
3.1.3.1.6 Enhancing oxygen mobility. The oxidation of the
adsorbed surface carbonaceous species can help eliminate the
coke deposition over supported metals and thus is beneficial to the
improvement of catalytic stability. As one of the most significant
rare earth oxides, ceria has been widely employed. When the cubic
fluorite structure of CeO2 is modified with Ga3+ cations, both the
surface oxygen mobility and lattice oxygen storage capacity are
enhanced.140 DFT calculations show that the addition of Ga can
greatly improve C3H6 desorption, and inhibit deep dehydrogenation
and the subsequent coke formation.
3.1.3.1.7 Coke transfer. In addition to inhibiting the coke
accumulation on a Pt surface, transferring coke precursors
from Pt to supports can also prolong the catalyst life. The
interaction between Pt and coke precursors is weakened by Pt
atoms with high electron density, leading the coke precursors
to migrate from the Pt sites to supports, hence resisting coke
deposition and improving the stability of the catalyst to a large
extent (Fig. 13i). Consequentially, the coke amount was signifi-
cantly decreased as the O2-TPO profiles in Fig. 13j show.72
Experimentally, the addition of Sn does not only inhibit C–C
bond cleavage and improve selectivity towards styrene, but also
allow the coke precursors to migrate from the active metals to
supports with large surface area. A drain off effect is proposed
to explain the decrease of the coke coverage on the metallic
sites upon addition of Sn. But until now, the coke transfer
pathway has not been directly demonstrated.
3.1.3.2 Catalyst sintering
3.1.3.2.1 Sintering mechanism. As discussed above, Pt cluster
size has a significant influence on the dehydrogenation pathway.
However, the Pt nanoparticles usually suﬀer from sintering at
high PDH reaction and regeneration temperatures, which could
lead to their permanent deactivation. In principle, two aspects
cause the sintering of metal particles. The Ostwald ripening
mechanism has been implied for metal nanoparticle sintering,
which occurs between the nanoparticles with cognizable
diameters. Due to their higher surface energies, smaller parti-
cles nearby are sacrificed to enhance the interparticle transport
of mobile species, causing the larger particles to grow.141

In addition, the migration–coalescence process has also been
implied to the metal sintering, which involves in the Brownian
motion of metal nanoparticles on the catalyst surface, resulting
in the formation of larger particles when the small particles are
close to each other. In PDH reactions, the Ostwald ripening has
been demonstrated to be the main sintering mechanism due to
the low Tammann temperature of Pt (750 1C). To date, many
efforts have been directed towards inhibiting the sintering
and/or helping re-disperse the aggregated nanoparticles during
the dehydrogenation and regeneration processes.
3.1.3.2.2 SMSI on oxide/non-oxide supports. Strong metal–
support interaction (SMSI) can be generated from chemical
reactions at the metal–oxide interface, diffusion, and charge
redistribution with a metal contacting with a reducible oxide.
Alumina-supported Pt is one of the major industrial catalysts
for light alkane dehydrogenation. Compared to Al2O3, CeO2 is
unique on account of its ability to trap Pt atoms in an ionic
form due to the stronger SMSI (Fig. 14a). The CeO2-supported
Pt–Sn clusters are highly stable, even upon extending the
reaction temperature to 680 1C. Moreover, upon oxidation the
Pt–Sn clusters easily recover to the atomically dispersed species
on CeO2 as shown in the TEM images in Fig. 14b, making
Pt–Sn/CeO2 a fully regenerable catalyst without deactivation of
reaction performance (Fig. 14c).74 In addition to the oxide
supports, SMSI is also developed on non-oxide carriers in
PDH reactions. Yue Wu and coworkers reported thermally
stable PtTi intermetallic NPs prepared via SMSI between plati-
num and MXenes. The results in this case showed that the
catalysts become highly selective and stable for light alkane
dehydrogenation.55
3.1.3.2.3 Encapsulation with oxides, carbon layers or meso-
porous materials. The confinement situation oﬀered by a sup-
port can provide a high surface area for dispersing active
metals, and exert a spatial constraint on metal clusters avoiding
from sintering. The package of a Pt core with an oxide shell
could eﬀectively prevent the aggregation of Pt nanoparticles at
high temperatures, and changing the core particle size and the
thickness of the shell is helpful in realizing controllable cata-
lytic performances. The coated Pt@SnO2/Al2O3 catalyst exhib-
ited better stability during propane dehydrogenation compared
with the conventional PtSn/Al2O3 catalyst, which is due to the
peculiar coated structure and the coated configuration being

maintained up to 700 1C. In addition, nanocarbons, such as carbon
nanotubes and nanodiamonds, are outstanding catalyst supports
for dehydrogenation (Fig. 14d). Compared with Al2O3 supports
(Fig. 14e), a defective graphene nanoshell leads to a strong protec-
tive eﬀect in inhibiting the agglomeration of Pt NPs (Fig. 14f).142
In addition, mesoporous materials have been reported as promising
supports for Pt-based catalysts for PDH owing to their confinement
eﬀect. Gong and coworkers used SBA-15 as a support and revealed
that the average size of a SBA-15-supported PtFe@Pt catalyst is
6.9  0.5 nm,47 and that of SiO2-supported PtFe@Pt is 21.4 
1.9 nm, indicating that the mesoporous structure of SBA-15 can
confine the nanoparticles inside to prevent them from severe
sintering during the reduction operation.
3.1.3.2.4 Fixation in zeolite crystals. Compared to the
encapsulation with mesoporous zeolites, a novel strategy for
preparing stable metal nanoparticle catalysts is provided by
fixing metal species in zeolite crystals (metal@zeolite), where
the stiﬀzeolite framework is beneficial to stabilize the metal
nanoparticles. Avelino Corma and coworkers found an innova-
tive approach that can generate Pt nanoparticles and single
Pt atoms with remarkably high thermal stability, formed within
purely siliceous MCM-22 during the growth of a two-dimensional
zeolite into three dimensions. High temperature oxidation–
reduction treatments lead to conversion of encapsulated Pt
species to small nanoparticles in the estimated size range of
1 to 2 nm.143 A second metal element such as Sn can be incorporated
together with Pt following the same synthesis procedure. A similar
situation occurred again. After calcination in air, Pt species in the
K-free PtSn@MFI sample agglomerate into nanoparticles, while the
Pt species in the K–PtSn@MFI sample remain atomically dispersed
(Fig. 14g and h).66,83 As displayed in Fig. 14i, the apparent Pt
dispersion decreases with reduction time, especially from 0 to 6 h.
The decrease in exposed surface Pt should be caused by the
formation of Pt–Sn interactions in a scenario in which partially
reduced Sn species interact with the external surfaces of the Pt
clusters. Consequently, the high catalytic performance of K–PtSn@
MFI can be maintained for at least three reaction–regeneration
cycles without obvious deactivation.
3.1.3.3 Other deactivation. Regenerating catalysts under oxi-
dizing (or oxychlorination) conditions followed by H2 reduction
is supposed to be an eﬀective method to remove the coke and
reactivate the catalysts. Nevertheless, such continuous generation
may not entirely restore catalytic performance, structural trans-
formation and then the eventual loss of activity and selectivity in
consecutive cycles.144 Significantly, for spent Al2O3-supported
PtSn catalysts, a portion of the Sn, which remains atomically
dispersed, is favorable for redispersion of the Pt to form small
nanoparticles on the Al2O3 surface.63 However, without Sn, Pt may
sinter into larger nanoparticles during oxidative regeneration. In
addition, the metal leaching and segregation reconstruction can
also lead to catalyst deactivation by high PDH temperatures and
complex atmospheres. Although many eﬀorts have been made,
further understanding of the deactivation mechanism and
proposals of eﬀective strategies should be achieved.
3.2
Active sites, dehydrogenation pathways and deactivation
mechanisms over metal oxide-based catalysts
3.2.1
Active sites. To achieve a comprehensive understanding
of propane dehydrogenation behavior on metal oxide-based cata-
lysts, identifying the exact nature of Lewis acid M–O sites on which
the adsorption of paraffin molecules takes place is quite necessary.
However, due to their structural complexity and the diversity of M–
O coordination, the understanding of the nature of the active sites
for PDH is still in progress.
For CrOx-based catalysts, as discussed above, unsaturated
and/or clustered Cr3+ sites are usually considered to be the
active sites. The four possible active structures of CrOx/Al2O3
structures are ‘‘isolated’’ mono-alumina chromate, ‘‘isolated’’
polymeric
alumina
chromate,
chromium–chromate
and
aluminum–chromium–chromate (Fig. 15a–d).90,91 Similarly, for
VOx-based catalysts, monovanadate, polyvanadate, and V2O5
crystallite species can coexist on the support based on the
vanadium loading.98,145,146 Typically, the tetrahedral structure
containing one V
Q
O bond and three bridging oxygen atoms
(namely, V–O–support or V–O–V) is the most likely structure for
low polymeric supported vanadium oxides.147 Many studies
have shown that monomeric vanadium clusters manifest a
high C–H bond activation ability.148–150
Over GaOx and ZrO2-based catalysts, there seem to be
diﬀerent dehydrogenation active sites. For GaOx-based cata-
lysts, the activity for PDH is strongly dependent on the structure
of Ga species. For bulk GaOx, some researchers think that Ga3+
ions are evenly distributed on the octahedron and tetrahedron,
which can provide a large number of weak acid sites. Moreover,
recently the [GaH]2+ ions together with a basic framework
oxygen of the Brønsted-acid site were identified as the active
sites in the case of Ga species in ZSM-5 zeolites. Over ZrO2-based
catalysts, coordinatively unsaturated Zr4+ cations (Zrcus) are the
active sites exhibiting PDH activity and selectivity.108 Two Zr
cations located at an oxygen vacancy are responsible for homolytic
C–H bond dissociation using quantum chemical calculations.108
Zrcus sites open an alternative pathway for homolytic C–H bond
activation with a lower activation barrier in comparison with non-
defected ZrO2, where lattice oxygen and zirconium cations are
required for this process on the stoichiometric surface of ZrO2.
Therefore, the complex structures and pretreatment of metal
oxides make it diﬃcult to reveal the nature of the active sites,
especially under the reaction conditions. Further in situ or
operando characterization methods should be used to reveal
the active sites.
3.2.2
Dehydrogenation pathways. Diﬀering from the dehy-
drogenation pathway on Pt-based catalysts, the dehydrogenation
over metal oxides is significantly dependent on their structures
and coordination environments. We mainly focus on the possible
dehydrogenation pathway on representative CrOx- and VOx-based
catalysts.
For CrOx-based catalysts, the possible mechanism of PDH
reaction over the isolated, unsaturated and/or clustered Cr3+
active sites has been studied. Typically, the propane adsorbed
would be converted into a Cr–C3H8 Z3-H,H,H adduct.93,151

intermediate. Subsequently, the b-H in the Cr3+–C3H7 inter-
mediate would be transformed on Cr3+ to form Cr3+–C3H6
hydride surface species. Then, C3H6 would be released and H2
would form, completing the catalytic cycle (Fig. 15e and f). The
formation of methane, ethane, and ethylene indicates that crack-
ing processes also occur under experimental conditions. For VOx-
based catalysts, due to their various V–O bonds, there are different
C–H activation and propylene desorption energy barriers. Three g-
Al2O3 supported dimer V2OxHy models were constructed to repre-
sent the catalysts with different pretreatment methods. The high-
est dehydrogenation barrier of 1.98 eV was found over V2O5H2
according to DFT calculation which corresponds to the lowest
initial activity and the presence of surface V–OH groups during the
experiment. It showed that dehydrogenation activity is under great
influence of the OH group even though it does take part in the
C–H cleavage indirectly (Fig. 15g).152 The experiment showed that
the same strongly adsorbed species occurs during both propane
dehydrogenation and propylene hydrogenation. According to
such an intermediate which may correspond to V species
containing a C
Q
C bond, i.e., V–C3H5, a reaction mechanism was
proposed.98
In addition to the typical dehydrogenation pathways on
metal oxides, Adam S. Hock and coworkers reported a non-
redox mechanism for activation of C–H and H–H bonds by
single-site Co2+ and single-site Zn2+/SiO2.153,154 Heterolytic C–H
bond activation in propane on a [Zn–O] active site is the
energetically most favorable pathway. The integrated mecha-
nism of PDH on the silica-supported Co2+ catalyst is that Co
alkyl and surface hydroxyl –OH are generated by heterolytic
cleavage of a C–H bond over Co–O and subsequently evolve
C3H6 by b-hydride elimination. The initial Co–O resting state
can be restored with the H2 generation and desorption after
the cobalt hydride reacts with the adjacent hydroxyl proton
(Fig. 15h).

Therefore, the dehydrogenation is diﬀerent and complex
over diﬀerent metal oxides. Additionally, at present, the identi-
fication of dehydrogenation pathways can only be achieved
with the help of theoretical simulation. Experimental observa-
tion to reveal the reaction intermediates and pathways remains
a grand challenge.
3.2.3
Deactivation mechanisms. During the dehydrogena-
tion of propane, because of the adsorption of paraﬃn mole-
cules on M–O sites in metal oxides, the acid–base pairs of metal
oxide dehydrogenation catalysts are deactivated owing to coke
deposition, and as for Pt-based catalysts, periodical regenera-
tion become indispensable. Although the catalysts recover most
of their activity after each reaction–regeneration cycle, the loss
of activity due to the sintering in the regeneration process is not
entirely reversible. In addition, due to the reducibility of some
metal oxides, the metal oxides can be reduced to the lower
oxidation state or even the metallic state. According to the
dehydrogenation mechanisms on the metal oxides, controlla-
ble regulations of structures and electronic properties, as
well as the supports and coverage of the reactants and coke
intermediates, can therefore help inhibit the deactivation of
metal oxide-based catalysts.
3.2.3.1 Coke formation
3.2.3.1.1 Coking mechanism. Compared with metal-based
catalysts, coke formation on metal oxides is more complex due
to their more complex structures. The coke formation could
cover the Lewis acid sites of metal oxides and alter their
catalytic properties. For CrOx-based catalysts, as shown in
Fig. 16a, two typical Raman bands corresponding to coke
deposits are observed. The G band (1590 cm1) corresponds
to the ring vibration of a perfect graphitic lattice, while the D1
band (1320 cm1) corresponds to the ring vibrations of defects
and edges of the graphitic lattice.92 It is seen that both the
yields of the C1–C3 byproducts and the coke increased with the
Cr6+ concentration in the catalyst. Increasing the Cr6+ concen-
tration from 0.78 to 1.68% caused simultaneous increases of
the C1–C3 yield from 2.3 to 3.3% and the coke yield from 2.81 to
3.8% (Fig. 16b).90 Evgenii V. Kondratenko and coworkers
allowed gaining novel insight into coke formation by kinetic

evaluation of the obtained data combined with characterization
of VOx species.97 The kinetic analysis of thermogravimetric
analysis profiles suggested that a carbon monolayer–multilayer
model can accurately describe this process. In this model, coke
deposition is supposed to occur over the carbon-free catalyst
surface as well as the already formed carbon deposits, and
another term is used to represent the elimination of oxygen of
the catalyst under reduction. To obtain the corresponding rate
constants, the weight curves were fitted according to eqn (7).

where mc is the maximum mass of the monolayer coke deposits,
i.e. the amount after the catalyst was fully covered by monolayer
coke deposition; k1 and k2 are the rate constants of coke formation
over the carbon-free catalyst surface and over carbon deposits,
respectively; and m0 and k0 stand for the weight loss upon
reduction of the catalysts and the rate constant of this process,
respectively. The stability of catalysts is determined by their coke
resistance ability, which is identified by an explicit relationship
between the catalyst deactivation rate and the rate constant of
carbon formation. Notably, when the degree of VOx polymeriza-
tion was varied to reach nanocrystalline V2O5, the rate constant of
carbon deposition sharply increased. This tendency was inter-
preted through a universal mechanism of coke formation –
adsorbed propylene or its fragments in close proximity to each
other can easily generate carbon precursors. Such a situation is
preferably realized on larger VOx species, whereas on smaller ones
it is statistically less possible.
In order to inhibit the coke formation, which is significantly
influenced by the valence states and dispersion structures,
various strategies including oxidation state modulation, increasing
dispersion, poisoning acid sites and cofeeding streams have been
operated.
3.2.3.1.2 Oxidation state manipulation. Manipulating the
oxidation states can aﬀect the local electronic structure of the
metal centers and the corresponding Lewis acidity. On fresh
VOx-based catalysts, there are many kinds of V species, including
isolated Vn+, oligomeric Vn+, and crystalline V2O5, which showed
diﬀerent ratios of V5+, V4+ and V3+ (Fig. 16c and d).98 Generally,
isolated, unsaturated and/or clustered V3+ Lewis-acid sites are
regarded as the active sites not only for PDH but also for cracking
and deep dehydrogenation. Compared with V3+, V4+ and V5+
species can eﬀectively inhibit the coke formation due to the
involvement of lattice oxygen (Fig. 16e). However, during the
reductive atmosphere of PDH, V4+ and V5+ species could be
quickly reduced.
3.2.3.1.3 Increasing dispersion. The rate constant of coke
formation was found to increase with the degree of polymeriza-
tion of VOx species. Gong’s work proposed that while 12 wt% V
supported on g-Al2O3 (12 V/Al2O3) corresponding to a theore-
tical monolayer coverage of 8 V nm2 suﬀers from rapid
deactivation due to severe coke deposition, it showed the best
activity. In spite of the fact that the V-loading is not beyond
the theoretical V-density for monolayer coverage, exhaustive
characterization proves the appearance of three dimensional
V2O5
nanoparticles.98,155
Therefore,
dispersing
the
three
dimensional V2O5 nanoparticles into two dimensional structures
could be an achievable method to decrease the coke deposition.
The surface area-to-metal loading ratio determines the form
of the species. Deactivation is low for single VOx sites but
increases with increasing degree of aggregation of VOx species
with increasing V–O–V bonds. In addition, doping can also help
increase the dispersion of VOx species. An encouraging effect of
magnesium has been suggested to stabilize VOx/Al2O3 catalysts
for PDH, according to the research of Wu et al.155 The conven-
tional incipient wetness impregnation method was used to
prepare a series of Mg-free and Mg-modified VOx/Al2O3 catalysts
(Fig. 16f). When Mg addition increases, the C3H6 selectivity is
improved from 82% to 93%. They showed that the stability of a
12 V/Al2O3 catalyst is significantly improved upon moderate
(1 wt%) Mg modification. Experimental evidence indicated that
appropriate Mg addition promotes the dispersion of V2O5 nano-
particles from three dimensional to two dimensional VOx species
which extremely reduce coke deposition and then enhance stabi-
lity on a large scale. When the Mg content is equal to or less than
1 wt%, the catalysts exhibit the same initial C3H8 conversion,
while the deactivation rate slows down monotonically as the Mg
content increases. However, once the loading of Mg exceeds
1 wt%, the initial activity decreases with increasing Mg loading
(Fig. 16g).
3.2.3.1.4 Poisoning acid sites. Although metal oxides (such
as Al2O3 and ZrO2) have been widely studied as supports for
CrOx and VOx catalysts, the stability is still too low due to the
strong acidity of supports. As for supported Pt-based catalysts,
acidic sites are also undesirable which can be poisoned by
doping with alkali metals like K, Na, Ca and Mg. It is revealed
that the amount of acidic sites of Cr–Zr–O catalysts is reduced
for K (0.2%, 0.5%, or 1%) doping, leading to an enhanced
C3H6 selectivity and resistance to coke formation in PDH
reaction.156,157 However, the addition of K species would also
have an adverse influence on the PDH process. An appropriate
promoter that improves the overall activity, selectivity, and anti-
coking capability is still under discovery.
3.2.3.1.5 Cofeeding stream. As metal oxide-based catalysts,
to promote propylene productivity, CO2 as a mild oxidant can
be cofed during propane dehydrogenation. There are signifi-
cant roles of CO2, including removal of coke deposition,
reoxidation of the reduced metal oxides, and hydrogen con-
sumption via the reverse water–gas shift reaction (RWGS).
Ogonowski et al. found that the roles remarkably depend on
the kinds of supports.158 When the basicity is appropriate, CO2
can promote the occurrence of RWGS. However, when these
basic sites in supports are extensively strong, CO2 irreversibly
adsorbs and poisons these sites. When there are no basic sites
on supports, the effects of CO2 cofeeding are very weak.
Comparatively, the increase of acidity could increase the coke
formation on supports.
In addition, cofeeding H2 can eﬀectively tune the coverage of
surface hydroxyl groups on the supported metal oxides, and

thus tune the desorption barrier of propylene. By combining
experimental and theoretical calculation studies, Gong and
coworkers demonstrated that the hydroxyl groups caused by
H2 pretreatment and cofeeding on VOx-based catalysts exhi-
bited a positive relationship with the propylene selectivity and
anti-deactivation resistance.152 For example, when VOx catalysts
were pretreated with H2, leading to the formation of surface
V–OH, the propylene selectivity could be improved and the coke
amount could be decreased (Fig. 16h). As a result, the H2
pretreatment time significantly influences the concentration
of surface V–OH and thus the initial activity and stability
(Fig. 16i), where longer H2 pretreatment contributes to the
lower deactivation rates despite the lower conversion. The
DFT calculations showed that the binding strength of C3H6
over V2O3 is very strong (2.05 eV), which is much favorable for
deep dehydrogenation to form C3H5 rather than desorption
compared with the surface covered with hydroxyl. Therefore,
desorption of propylene could be inhibited over the highly
reduced V2O3 in the absence of V
Q
O and V–OH, leading to
deep dehydrogenation and coke deposition. Comparatively, the
existence of surface V–OH blocks the exposure of V ions,
leading to a lower desorption energy of propylene and higher
propylene selectivity.
3.2.3.2 Other deactivation. As discussed above, cracking and
coking side processes occur that make oxidative regeneration
necessary with the overall reduction–regeneration cycle being
around 20 minutes. Thus, deactivation caused by regeneration
is another deactivation phenomenon. For CrOx/Al2O3 catalysts,
Cr-containing species on the surfaces of the supported catalysts
undergo multiple redox cycles. In a reductive atmosphere,
Cr6+Ox and Cr5+Ox species reduce to Cr3+Ox and coordinatively
unsaturated Cr3+ ions appear on the surface. In the regenera-
tion stage, Cr6+Ox and Cr5+Ox species appear again on reoxida-
tion with concomitant spreading on the surface.159 One of the
features of CrOx/Al2O3 catalysts is the absence of complete
reversibility of the CrOx surface species into their original state
on reoxidation. As a consequence, a monotonic decrease of
catalytic activity from cycle-to-cycle is frequently observed
owing to the surface concentration decrease of active sites.
In addition, the alteration of surface composition and phase
structure could induce catalyst deactivation. For example,
g-alumina could transform to y- or even a-alumina at high
temperatures, leading to a decrease of surface area. Doping
with another component could inhibit the transformation
process. For example, B. Ersoy et al. observed that the addition
of La2O3 to sol–gel derived alumina gels increased the g-Al2O3
to a-Al2O3 transformation temperature to 1200 1C.160
In addition, reduction of metal oxides to their metallic state
can also lead to the loss of active components and activity. For
example, as reducible oxides, ZnO-based catalysts obtained by
supporting methods often suﬀer from rapid deactivation,
which is attributed to the continuous reduction of ZnO species
via water elimination during the dehydrogenation reaction
process.161,162 It is reported that Zn/ZSM-5 with isolated Zn2+
ions stabilized at the cation-exchange sites exhibits exceptional
stability, which can be explained by the catalyst structure where
O is bound to the framework Si/Al atoms of zeolites, resulting in
great resistance towards reduction. In addition, doping of
noble Pt can also inhibit the reduction deactivation.163
On the one hand, the Lewis acidity of ZnO can be increased
with the transfer between ZnO and Pt atoms. On the other
hand, the H2 over the ZnO surface could more easily desorb,
leading to the inhibition of H2O formation.162
4. Advances in catalyst design
According to the dehydrogenation pathways and deactivation
mechanisms over the specific active sites on metal and metal
oxide-based catalysts, active, selective and stable catalysts are
highly desired in the PDH process. Although various catalysts
have shown superior dehydrogenation performance, the eﬃ-
cient design strategies and new chemistry have not been well
summarized. Therefore, in the next section, several advanced
catalyst design strategies, such as alloying/dealloying, single
atom catalysis, subsurface catalysis, defect engineering, metal-
hydride chemistry, and the newly developed chemistry in
mediating SMSI over metal and metal oxide-based catalysts,
have been introduced. Optimal design should rationally con-
sider the aforementioned eﬀects and maximize the benefits.
4.1
Advances in Pt-based catalyst design
4.1.1
Alloying/dealloying. As discussed above, bimetallic
catalysts have been widely investigated to break the scaling
relationship during PDH reaction, which can increase the
geometric dispersion and lower the C3H6 desorption energy
and, thus increase the selectivity. A series of alloy materials
including PtCu, PtZn, PtIn, and PtGa have been demonstrated
for highly eﬃcient propylene production. Gong and coworkers
demonstrated a computational calculation research study on
probability-based sifting, leading to a successful identification
of an optimum bimetallic alloy (Pt3In) for PDH (Fig. 17a).164
Owing to the uncertainty of DFT calculation, Pt3In turned out to
exhibit a catalytic activity resembling that of pure Pt and Pt3Sn
as well as a mass enhancement in the propylene selectivity
compared with pure Pt. In addition to metal promoters, non-
metal promoters can also be eﬀectively alloyed with Pt recently.
Boration of Pt metal surfaces extends the lifetime of the catalyst
by preventing coke adsorption. Anastassia N. Alexandrova and
coworkers theoretically probed boron as a dopant for small Pt
clusters deposited on magnesia, and found that it reduces the
aﬃnities of these systems to carbon atoms (Fig. 17b).165 In what
follows, they showed that nano-alloying with boron dramatically
changes the properties of alkene binding and dehydrogenation.
In contrast to alloying, a chemical reaction involving the
selective separation and removal of one constituent element
from the alloy, causing degradation of its intrinsic properties.
Considering the highly reductive atmosphere, one component
in the Pt-based alloy could segregate to the surface, leading
to non-selective C–C bond cleavage. For example, for PtM
(M = Fe, Co, Ni) alloys, the surface M metals decrease the

C3H6 selectivity because of the easier C–C cracking on exposed
M sites. Acid leaching treatment of PtM alloys can wipe off the
surface M atoms, leaving those in subsurface sites intact
because of the shielding of a Pt shell, thus creating a Pt-skin
or Pt-skeleton surface with M atoms in subsurface sites and
inhibiting the C–C cracking on exposed M sites.47
4.1.2
Single atom catalysis. Although PtM bimetals exten-
sively improve the activity and selectivity, compared with pure
Pt, it is still restricted by the scaling relationship in PtM alloys
wherein the activity and selectivity are mutually restricted.
Because of the ultimate dispersion of active metals and the
homogeneous composition of the active species, single-atom
catalysts (SACs) including supported single atoms, single-atom
alloys (SAAs) and intermetallic alloys (IMAs) have demonstrated
the ability to break the scaling relationship with excellent
catalytic activity and selectivity in PDH reactions. The single
atom Pt site ensembles weaken the interaction between the
propylene intermediate and its surface through a single bond
instead of more stable three Pt–C interactions on 3-fold hollow
sites over Pt clusters. However, the provenance of the promoted
catalytic performance of the single atom catalysis remains
under argument. The current review also compiles evidence
for the deep comprehension of the catalytic properties of SACs.
4.1.2.1 Supported Pt single atoms. Supports have played an
obviously important role in single atom catalysts. The mutual
action between the SACs and the supports both provides the
catalysts mechanical strength and exerts a prominent influence
on their catalytic performance. Jones et al. mixed Pt/Al2O3 with
CeO2 powder aged at 800 1C which led to trapped atomic Pt
catalysis.166 In their following work, they tested atomic PtSn
catalysts supported on CeO2 in PDH.74 The CeO2 support can
decentralize Pt catalyst and recover the original activity after
regeneration. In another study, the Pt single atom is obtained
in the framework of an MCM-22 support.167 More interestingly,
the single Pt atom and subnanometer Pt clusters have good
performance in the dehydrogenation of propane. Although the
supported Pt single atoms have exhibited the superior ability of
C–H activation, the coordination environment and electronic
state are significantly influenced by the support, leading to the
formation of Pt ions and alteration of propylene adsorption,
which should be carefully regulated.

4.1.2.2 Single atom alloys. In addition to the oxide supports
as discussed above, metals can also serve as eﬃcient supports
to disperse the Pt single atoms to form single atom alloys.
Recently, E. C. H. Sykes and coworkers took a diﬀerent method
that utilized the minimum amount of a catalytically active
metal (Pt) single atom in the upper layer of a non-active host
metal (Cu) to enhance C–H activation while shunning coke
deposits that is characteristic of larger ensembles.45 These SAAs
are viewed as analogies to single-atom catalysts. The authors
further explored the reaction mechanism of C–H activation on
these alloy surfaces and figured out that Pt/Cu alloys activate
C–H bonds with prominently enhanced activity over Cu, while
avoiding the coke deposits that typically occur with Pt ensem-
bles due to Cu’s ability to facilitate C–C coupling reaction.
Additionally, Gong and coworkers described that Pt/Cu SAA
supported on Al2O3 (Fig. 17c) can break the scaling relationship
for
propane
dehydrogenation
to
achieve
simultaneous
enhancements of propylene selectivity (B90%) and propane
conversion.135 They found that the isolated Pt atoms dispersed
in the Cu nanoparticles (TEM image in Fig. 17d) maintain a
moderate dehydrogenation activation barrier and simulta-
neously exhibit a fairly high selectivity, which is demonstrated
by the low desorption barrier of propylene and high deep
dehydrogenation barrier. However, the long-term stability of
SACs under practical reaction conditions especially under the
regeneration reactions is yet to be improved due to the low
sintering resistance of the host metals despite their high
activity and selectivity.
4.1.2.3 Intermetallic alloys. Compared with SAAs, inter-
metallic alloys have shown excellent long-term stability in
various chemical reactions because of their unusual structural
stability while exhibiting single-site structures.168,169 Upon iso-
lating Pt atoms with another metal and constructing an inter-
metallic structure, that is, a Pt-based IMA with single-atom Pt
sites, desired catalysts with satisfactory catalytic selectivity and
stability might be obtainable. By using in situ X-ray absorption
and synchrotron X-ray diﬀraction, Jeﬀrey T. Miller and cow-
orkers proposed that Pt1Zn1 IMAs are dominantly formed from
precursors on amorphous SiO2.42 These bimetallic alloy cata-
lysts contain segregated Pt atoms on their surfaces with solely
metallic Zn nearest neighbors and exhibited high ethylene
selectivity (B100%) in ethane dehydrogenation at 600 1C.
Recently, Shinya Furukawa and coworkers reported that single
atom Pt included in thermally stable intermetallic PtGa worked
as an ultrastable and selective catalyst for PDH at high
temperatures.
Intermetallic
PtGa
displayed
three-hold-Pt
ensembles and single Pt atoms isolated by catalytically inert
Ga at the surface, the former of which could be selectively
blocked and disabled by Pb deposition.52 The PtGa–Pb/SiO2
catalyst exhibited 30% conversion with 99.6% propylene selec-
tivity at 600 1C for 96 h without lowering the performance.
The single-atom Pt well catalyzed the first and second C–H
activation, but effectively inhibited the third one, which mini-
mized the side reactions to coke and drastically improved the
selectivity and stability.
4.1.3
Subsurface catalysis. In addition to single-atom
catalysis, subsurface catalysis can also improve the catalytic
activity and utilization eﬃciency of Pt-based catalysts. As a
design method for developing cost-reduced catalysts, core
(nonprecious element)/shell structures where the Pt element
is substituted with nonprecious elements have been widely
used. Theoretical calculations have suggested that the d-band
center of Pt on the surface would be downshifted by subsurface
transition metals (TMs), which, as a consequence, attenuates
the binding of adsorbates onto the Pt surface. In addition to
the subsurface metal atoms, the population of C and H in the
subsurface regions also potently influences the surface reactions
and exerts a protrusive eﬀect on the selectivity of propane
dehydrogenation.
Gong and coworkers described a facile construction of
Pt-3dTM@Pt [3dTM (3d transition metal) = Fe, Co, and Ni]
core–shell catalysts (Fig. 17f).47 Experimental evidence indi-
cated that the C3H6 selectivity of the PtFe@Pt/SBA-15 catalyst
becomes B20% higher than that of the Pt/SBA-15 catalyst. The
C3H6 desorption energy on pure Pt was expected to be 1.10 eV,
higher than the 0.96 eV for the C–H bond breaking of
the C3H6*, revealing that the deep dehydrogenation of C3H6
preceded the desorption of C3H6, while on the Pt-skin surface
with subsurface 3d transition metals (3dTMs), the situation was
reversed. There exists a linear relationship between the relative
d band center and propylene selectivity (Fig. 17e). As a result,
Pt-skin catalysts with 3dTMs in the subsurface region exhibit
higher C3H6 selectivity compared with pure Pt catalysts. However,
the unique property and potential of subsurface layers on such
catalysts remain to be investigated.
Recently, Jeﬀrey T. Miller and coworkers demonstrated a
clear subsurface eﬀect over two diﬀerent intermetallic Pt–Mn
catalysts with different subsurfaces.49 The Pt3Mn catalyst
contains intermetallic composites with a uniform phase com-
position and structure of Pt3Mn on both the subsurface and
surface, while Pt3Mn-s, distinguished from Pt3Mn, possesses
core–shell structure NPs with a regulated Pt3Mn intermetallic
shell on a Pt core. A comparison between these two catalysts
leads to rational evaluation of the effects of diverse subsurfaces
(Pt vs. Pt3Mn) on the catalytic performance of supported NPs
with the identical Pt3Mn surface. This subsurface effect can
also be distinguished from a classic surface effect revealed by
the difference between Pt3Mn-s and the reference Pt catalyst
when comparing Pt3Mn to Pt3Mn-s, which discloses a distinct
subsurface effect that is independent from the surface structure.
They found that the Mn in the subsurface exerts a prominent
influence on weakening the surface adsorption strength, most
likely through bonding between subsurface atoms and surface
atoms. The Pt3Mn intermetallic bulk has a lower adsorption
energy for all the investigated adsorbates compared with the
Pt3Mn intermetallic shell on the Pt core, verifying the existence
of the subsurface effect. Such an effect can be modified by a
diffusion controlled solid state transformation from the surface to
the core for modulating the subsurface structure.

controllable regulation of the intensity of SMSI to tune the
activity and selectivity remains a great challenge. It has been
known that several properties of the support are crucial for
charge transfer, such as its reducibility, conductivity, exposed
crystal facets, morphology and defects. Analysis of the data
acquired by a series of methods deduces a conclusion that the
proposed approach to modifying platinum (a preliminary
incorporation of the modifying element into the structure of
the support) generates both geometric and ligand eﬀects.
Recently, several regulation strategies of SMSI have been newly
developed.
Using mineral-type precursors with exchangeable metal
cations homogeneously distributed in a well-defined crystal,
metal nanoparticles highly dispersed on thermally and chemi-
cally stable oxides are readily formed upon calcination and
reduction. The partial substitution of metal cations M2+/M3+
with two diﬀerent kinds of metal ions could also produce a
bimetallic catalyst with highly dispersed metal/metal alloys and
modulate the interaction between Pt and supports. For example,
a zinc-containing support substantially modifies the formation
of supported platinum particles together with the adsorption and
catalytic properties of platinum.137 The reduction of platinum
from the oxide precursors anchored onto the support and the
simultaneous Pt-promoted partial reduction of zinc resulted in
the formation of supported bimetallic particles whose composi-
tion and mutual action with the support depend on the zinc
content.
Additionally, altering the defect amounts of supports has
been demonstrated to regulate the SMSI. For Al2O3 supported
Pt catalysts, previous results have shown that coordinatively
unsaturated pentacoordinate Al3+ (Al3+ penta) sites abounding
on the (100) facets of the g-Al2O3 surface serve as anchoring
sites of Pt. At relatively low loadings, the active catalytic species
are atomically dispersed on the support surface (Al3+ penta/
Pt = 1), whereas two-dimensional Pt rafts are formed at higher
degrees of coverage (Fig. 17g).80 Recently, a highly active and
stable PtSn/Al2O3 sheet catalyst for the PDH reaction has been
synthesized by An-Hui Lu and coworkers, using g-Al2O3
nanosheets as a support that is rich in pentacoordinate Al3+
ions. Such Al2O3 nanosheets exhibit extraordinary performance
in decentralizing and stabilizing raft-like Pt–Sn clusters with
increasing electron density of Pt sites and electronic interactions
between the two metals (Fig. 17h).73
4.2
Advances in metal oxide-based catalyst design
4.2.1
Mixed oxides. Using mixed-metal oxides is one of the
most frequently used approaches in metal oxide-based catalyst
design. The substitution disrupts chemical bonding at the
surface of the host oxide, and optimists hope that this will
modify favorably its catalytic activity. The active centers in such
a system could be either the oxygen atoms near the dopant
or the dopant itself. This is not the only kind of ‘‘creative
disturbance’’ that can activate the surface of an oxide. The
catalytic activity of a small (molecular size) cluster MOx (where
M is a cation, O is oxygen, and x is usually unknown) supported
on the surface of another oxide (or any other insulator) is often
very diﬀerent from that of the bulk oxide of M.170,171 For
example, VOx clusters supported on ZrO2 are more active for
PDH than either V2O5 or ZrO2.172 The interaction between VOx
and ZrO2 can promote the reduction of V–O bonds, including
V
Q
O, V–O–V and V–O–Zr. This effect could be induced by the
formation of low coordinated V species in VOx/ZrO2. The
so-called ‘‘inverse catalysts’’ are similar. They consist of a very
thin oxide film supported on a metal surface. Fundamentally,
the interfacial structure of the mixed oxides plays a significant
role in their superior performance when designing a mixed-metal
oxide catalyst. Recently, the development of refined preparation
methods such as incipient wet impregnation, coprecipitation and
sol–gel synthesis contributes to the maximum of interfacial
structures by atomic modulation. As discussed above, the coordi-
natively unsaturated Ga–H species show higher activity than other
Ga species. Recently, Julia Vecchietti et al. prepared cerium–
gallium mixed oxides through co-precipitation methods.173
On the ceria–gallia mixed oxides interfaces, gallium sites break
the H–H bond forming Ga–H and OH surface sites, which
recombine to form water and an oxygen vacancy that reduce
Ce4+ to Ce3+. It is proposed that the generation of Ga  O–Ce
sites in the periphery of such surface gallia nanodomains
contributes to the promoted reactivity of the mixed oxides.
On bulk mixed oxides, the introduction of heterogeneous
metal eﬀectively tunes the host metal oxides. Doping of metal
oxides is generally explored to acquire promoted electronic,
optical, and catalytic performance. The major mechanism
behind such property tuning is to reach control over doping
that modifies electron transfer characteristics. For example,
Chen et al. used the co-impregnation method and prepared Mo
atomic-scale doped Mo–V–O mixed oxides (TEM and line
profiles in Fig. 18a and b).174 The atomic-scale doping of Mo
atoms effectively modulate the V–O coordination, suppressing
the lattice oxygen diffusion and exhibiting higher selectivity of
propylene.
4.2.2
Organometallic chemistry. Based on the active sites
and deactivation mechanism, it has been acknowledged that a
metal oxide with higher dispersion presents higher propylene
selectivity and stability. For example, it suggests that isolated
VOx species show higher intrinsic activity in comparison with
their oligomerized counterparts. However, the conventional
preparation methods cannot obtain the homogeneous structures
of single-sites.
Surface organometallic chemistry brings about the generation
of well-defined surface species on various supports by colonising
tailored molecular precursors on supports with segregated –OH
sites. Additionally, creating isolated metal sites on non-reducible
supports such as silica could inhibit reduction and lead to the
development of catalysts with promoted stability under PDH
conditions. Christophe Cope
´ret and coworkers described the
synthesis and structural characterization of the molecular
complex [Ga(OSi(OtBu)3)3(THF)] (Fig. 18d) and its exploita-
tion as a precursor for creating gallium single-sites on silica.
These isolated gallium sites were acquired through grafting of
[Ga(OSi(OtBu)3)3(THF)] on silica and subsequent heating at
500 1C under high vacuum. The presented gallium species

exhibit excellent catalytic performances with considerably high
activity, selectivity and stability in the dehydrogenation of
propane.106 Similarly, Adam S. Hock recently reported that
single-site Zn2+ (Co2+) on a silica catalyst (Fig. 18c) prepared
by tuning the pH of the solution using concentrated ammo-
nium hydroxide (NH4OH) is catalytically active for propane
dehydrogenation, exhibiting 95% selectivity at 550 1C.153,154
The oxidation state of Zn remains unchanged under propane at
reaction temperature due to the Zn–O–Si bonds.
4.2.3
Defect engineering. Defects of metal oxides, such as
atom vacancies and dopants, show the possibility of adsorbing
unconventional
PDH
intermediates
and,
thus,
selectively
enhancing the corresponding pathway toward propylene. It is
suggested that coordinatively unsaturated metal cations (Mx+
cus)
that are close to oxygen vacancies act as adsorption sites for
light alkanes. Surface oxygen sites serve as H acceptors,
abstracting H from the adsorbed alkane molecules.
As discussed above, defected ZrO2-based materials are active
and
durable
for
non-oxidative
propane
dehydrogenation
(Fig. 18e). Reductive pretreatment of the catalysts prominently
enhances catalytic activity due to the generation of Zrcus sites.
The existence of Ru on the surfaces of ZrO2-based catalysts
promotes H spillover and thus further facilitates reduction of
ZrO2 (Fig. 18f).109 In addition to bulk ZrO2, partially reduced
ZnO175 and WO3
176 can act as the catalysts for PDH when
oxides
are
activated
by
hydrogen
pretreatment
and/or
co-feeding. Their catalytic activity is subject to hydrogen pre-
treatment time and the feed gas composition.
In addition to the defect sites as the active sites, the defect
can also eﬀectively modulate the adsorption of the propylene
intermediate. As discussed above, the incipient activity and
deactivation rate turned out to be linearly relevant to the
intensity of the V–OH band which reflects the quantity of the
hydroxyl groups on the VOx species. The presence of surface
V–OH decreases the desorption barrier of propylene and thus
promotes the desorption of propylene and decreases the coke
formation.

segregation (isolated surface hydrides). Their formation is
motivated by the heterolytic activation of H2 on pair sites of
oxygen (O) and metal (M) atoms (M–O bonds on metal oxides,
unbound M and O pairs, and metal–support interfaces) or the
homolytic activation of H2 on metallic surfaces or on metal
oxides that involves simultaneous reduction of the metal sites
(Fig. 18g).
Recently Kenichi Shimizu and coworkers found the for-
mation of indium (In)-hydride species supported by chabazite
(CHA) zeolites after H2 pretreatment at high temperatures
(4500 1C).177 In situ Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectro-
scopy and DFT calculations demonstrated that the [InH2]+ ion
on a framework anionic site is the authentic structure. Kinetic
and in situ spectroscopic studies together with transition state
(TS) calculations suggested that [InH2]+ ions function as cata-
lytically active sites for selective dehydrogenation. Additionally,
the active sites for PDH in Ga/H-ZSM-5 with medium quantities
of tetrahedral aluminum in the lattice were distinguished to be
Lewis–Brønsted acid pairs.102 The [GaH]2+, together with a
basic framework oxygen of the Brønsted-acid site, heterolyti-
cally activates a propane C–H bond with a very low intrinsic
enthalpy barrier of 56 kJ mol1. This Lewis–Brønsted acid pair
turned out to be far more active than an isolated Ga+, which can
be attributed to the increasing Lewis acidity upon protonation
of Ga+ by the Brønsted acid site which promotes heterolytic
C–H bond activation (Fig. 18h). Besides, the Brønsted acid site
prominently detruncates the activation barrier for H2 elimina-
tion which is considerably high for the isolated Ga+ because the
proton originates from an alkyl C–H bond with the simulta-
neous elimination of propene.
5. Summary and perspectives
In this review, we have summarized current understandings of
catalyst development, new chemistry, and emerging techno-
logies in catalytic propane dehydrogenation. However, steps
will need to be taken to overcome drawbacks of this reaction
and improve the energy eﬃciency, that is, the limited equili-
brium conversion and the prevalence of side reactions at high
temperatures. Additionally, great eﬀorts have been made to
improve the performances of CrOx- and Pt-based catalysts by
using various strategies. However, further improvements with
lower noble metal loadings and deactivation rates are highly
desired. Moreover, advanced characterization and deeper dis-
cussion of active sites and reaction mechanisms under reaction
conditions are still inadequate. Although grand opportunities
exist, several major challenges in the aspects of dehydrogena-
tion technologies, catalyst development and characterization as
well as theoretical stimulation methods should be considered.
(1) An
alternative dehydrogenation process
is urgent.
Although direct dehydrogenation routes have been industria-
lized, the propane productivity is still thermodynamically
limited. Comparatively, ODH due to its favorable thermo-
dynamics has the potential to improve reaction eﬃciency.
Gaseous oxygen is often cofed to lower the reaction temperature
and coke deposition. However, there remain grand challenges
to inhibit the overoxidation of propylene to COx. Additionally,
the active sites and reaction mechanisms are still on debate.
Recently, I. Hermans and coworkers reported that hexagonal
boron nitride (h-BN) and boron nitride nanotubes (BNNTs)
exhibited unique and hitherto unanticipated catalytic properties
resulting in great selectivity to olefins of about 79% propylene and
12% ethylene.178 In addition, activating alkane C–H bonds at low
temperature may provide opportunities to improve the propylene
selectivity. Jason F. Weaver and coworkers reported that ethane
forms strongly-bound s-complexes on IrO2(110) and that a large
fraction of the complexes undergo C–H bond cleavage at tem-
peratures below 200 K.179 Partial hydrogenation of the IrO2(110)
surface is crucial to increase propylene selectivity while decreasing
the overoxidation to COx. Therefore, developing low-temperature
and highly selective catalysts is the direction for their industrial
application for ODH reactions.
In addition to ODH technology, chemical looping oxidative
dehydrogenation (CL-ODH) based on redox catalysts, which is
capable of selectively oxidizing the hydrogen evolved by the
selective hydrogen combustion (SHC) reaction, could be a
moderate dehydrogenation technology.180,181 Recently, Gong
and coworkers reported an alternative chemical looping oxida-
tive dehydrogenation approach.32,174 At 500 1C, Mo–V–O mixed
oxides achieve 89% propylene selectivity at 36% propane
conversion
over
100 dehydrogenation–regeneration
cycles.
Due to the limited oxygen capacity and complex oxygen reac-
tivity, modulating the lattice oxygen to selectively produce
propylene during the redox cycles is crucial.
In addition, coupling exothermic reactions such as CO2
hydrogenation,118 ammonia synthesis,182 olefin refinment183,184
and hydrogen storage185 with the endothermic non-oxidative PDH
can promote the transformation of propane. Appropriate reaction
temperature and the matching of individual active sites are the
key issues.
Besides, ambient temperature or near-ambient catalytic
dehydrogenation processes including solar photocatalysis and
electrocatalysis can significantly reduce energy consumption as
well as operating costs compared with the conventional thermo-
chemical dehydrogenation process. However, the performances
of photocatalysts and electrocatalysts are still limited by their
insuﬃcient C–H activation ability. More importantly, the reaction
mechanism is still undiscovered due to the complex features in
photocatalysis and electrocatalysis environments.
(2) Research on alternative catalysts to conventional metal and
metal oxide-based catalysts remains a great challenge.186 Metal
oxides such as VOx- and GaOx-based catalysts have been widely
developed with the expectation that they could be superior alter-
natives to CrOx-based and Pt-based catalysts. However, their dehy-
drogenation performances are still unsatisfactory compared with
the industrial catalysts. In addition, the types of supports, promoters
and preparation methods significantly influence the catalyst struc-
tures. Therefore, developing novel eﬃcient methods to further
improve their dehydrogenation performance is highly desired.
Besides conventional Pt and oxide-based catalysts, transition-
metal nitrides and carbides may oﬀer promising economic

alternatives to conventional noble-metal catalysts. A key issue for
improving this class of materials is the development of synthesis
methods that produce materials with high surface areas and
particle sizes in the nanometer range.
(3) Revealing the active sites and mechanisms of these
catalysts under reaction conditions is highly urgent and
challenging. Operando/in situ characterization techniques should
be encouraged and operated, such as in situ and time-resolved
XAFS, XRD, XPS, and environmental TEM (E-TEM). For industrial
PtSn/Al2O3 catalysts, the roles of diﬀerent Sn species as well as
the coking behaviors are still undiscovered. For metal oxide-
based catalysts, various species exist on their surfaces. For
example, there are various kinds of Cr species (such as Cr6+,
Cr5+, Cr3+, Cr2+, isolated Cr, oligomeric Crn+, and crystalline
Cr2O3) and Ga species (such as Ga3+, [GaH2]+, [GaH]2+, and
polymorphs of gallium oxides) that exist on CrOx- and GaOx-
based catalysts, which makes it diﬃcult to identify the actual
active sites, especially under PDH reaction conditions.
(4) Theoretical calculations are increasingly adopted to assist
in explaining experimental results. However, the matching
degree between experimental details and DFT models is limited
due to the complexity of the practical catalysts and processes.
It is pressing to establish a universal relationship between
structure and activity. For example, for PtSn/Al2O3 catalysts,
the Sn species could be dynamically changed under reaction
conditions. In this sense, it is urgently necessary to pay special
attention to the research on more realistic models for dehydro-
genation catalysts.
(5) Scale-up of dehydrogenation catalysts with well-defined
structures is still full of grand challenges. The preparation of
dehydrogenation catalysts with well-defined structures is highly
fine and needs specific operation steps, especially for those
shaped and single atom catalysts. Recent studies on single-site
catalysis have focused on the exploitation of single-atom and/or
single site Pt for PDH. However, the single atom Pt still suﬀers
from sintering and reconstruction especially under PDH
conditions. Therefore, developing thermodynamically stable
single atom catalysts is highly desired in the field of propane
dehydrogenation. Novel methods such as strong electrostatic
adsorption, galvanic replacement, sequential reduction, and
incipient wetness coimpregnation provide opportunities for the
scale-up of production of single atom catalysts.
In summary, we have identified the development of
advanced
dehydrogenation technologies,
catalyst
design
and new chemistry in catalytic propane dehydrogenation
reactions. Despite the significant and challenging task
ahead, we believe that a combination of intensified dehydro-
genation processes, controllable synthesis methodologies,
and fine characterization techniques, together with mecha-
nistic investigation, will further ensure the development of
propane dehydrogenation.
