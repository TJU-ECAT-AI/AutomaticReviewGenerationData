Abstract
Sn modified ZSM-5 was hydrothermally synthesized and this kind of zeolite was used as the support for platinum catalyst in propane dehydrogenation. In this tin-doped material, XRD results established the presence of highly crystalline and the analysis of SEM showed the deterioration in crystal quality. The incorporation of Sn into the framework of ZSM-5 zeolite introduced the strong interactions between Sn species and the support, thus more amounts of tin could exist in oxidized form. Moreover, on the Sn-containing PtNa/Sn-ZSM-5 catalyst, the substitution of Sn changed the interfacial character between Pt and the support, which in consequence promoted the occurrence of spillover hydrogen and facilitated the reduction of Pt species. Compared with the conventional impregnated PtNa/HZSM-5 and PtSnNa/HZSM-5 catalysts, the Sn-modified ZSM-5-based Pt catalyst exhibited higher reaction activity and stability. It showed the lowest deactivation parameter (6.2%) and exhibited a selectivity to propene higher than 98% with the corresponding propane conversion of about 39.0% after the reaction for 9 h.

Introduction
Bimetallic platinum–tin catalysts are widely used in the process of propane dehydrogenation. The catalytic dehydrogenation of propane is of increasing importance because of the growing demand for propene. (1-3) However, this reaction is an endothermic process and thus requires a relatively high temperature to obtain a high yield of propene. Therefore, the catalyst deactivation due to coke formation is inevitable because of the rigorous reaction conditions. It is the key to enhance the propene yield by developing new catalysts with high-activity, high-stability, and high-selectivity. (4, 5)
In the past few years, ZSM-5 zeolite has been used as an efficient support for platinum catalyst in the propane dehydrogenation reaction. (6-8) Kumar and his co-workers (9) investigated the influence of the pore geometry of catalyst supports on the Pt catalytic properties for propane dehydrogenation and pointed out that the three-dimensional microporous ZSM-5 was a better catalytic support than the mesoporous SBA-15. Our previous work (7, 8) studied the effects of promoters and reaction conditions on the catalytic performance of PtSn/ZSM-5 catalyst in propane dehydrogenation and found that the way in which the promoter was added could influence the final properties, not only of the support but also of the metallic phases.
Unfortunately, on the ZSM-5 supported platinum catalyst, the pure ZSM-5 material does not exhibit the desired interactions with the active sites and the promoters. Nowadays, this inconvenience has been overcome by incorporation metal species into the material matrix. Although the incorporation of the metal cation into the structure of the microporous molecular sieve commonly produces the partial deterioration of the ordered structure, the newly created active centers have shown an improved catalytic behavior in a wild range of reactions. (10-13) In this sense, Yuranov et al. (14) systematically investigated the catalytic performances of Fe-Beta and Fe-ZSM-5 catalysts in the benzene to phenol transformation with N2O. The results of this work showed that the catalytic activity of the isomorphously substituted Fe-ZSM-5 catalyst was much higher than that of the Fe-β one and main reason was attributed to the geometry of Fe (II) active sites. Salama et al. (15) discussed the structure and textural characteristics of the CeIV framework-substituted mordenite and ZSM-5 zeolites in the NO adsorption–interaction. It was found that that the intervention of the cerium couple (CeIII /CeIV) was more facilitated on Ce-ZSM-5in than on CeMin. To the best of our knowledge, there is little literature about the presence of Sn as a support for Pt catalyst in the reaction of propane dehydrogenation. Compared with the conventional impregnated catalyst, the metal-substituted ZSM-5 support may give rise to an increased catalytic activity, improved selectivity and stability.
In the present work, Sn-ZSM-5 zeolite was hydrothermally synthesized and then was used as a support for platinum in propane dehydrogenation. The catalytic activity, selectivity, and stability of the PtNa/Sn-ZSM-5 catalyst were compared with those of the PtNa/HZSM-5 and PtSnNa/HZSM-5 ones. All of the catalysts were studied by several techniques, including X-ray fluorescence (XRF), nitrogen adsorption, SEM, NH3-TPD, XPS, H2-TPD, and TPR. Particular emphasis was focused on the changes in the Sn-support interaction and in the character of Pt active sites.
Experimental Section
Synthesis of the Zeolite
ZSM-5 zeolite was hydrothermally synthesized and the reagents used in the synthesis were silicasol, sodium meta-aluminate, NaOH, hexanediamine and distilled water. The molar composition of the gel was (60–100) SiO2: (0.15–0.3) Al2O3: 3.5NaOH: 1400 H2O: 15 NH2(CH2)6NH2. Then, the mixture was transferred into a Teflon-lined stainless-steel autoclave and heated at 160 °C for 24 h. The as-synthesized zeolite was calcined at 550 °C in air for 8 h to decompose the organic template, followed by NH4+-exchange with a 1 M NH4Cl solution three times. The proton form of ZSM-5 (H-ZSM-5) was obtained by calcining the ammonium form of ZSM-5 at 550 °C for 8 h.
Sn-ZSM-5 was synthesized by adding SnCl2 solid into the silicasol, sodium meta-aluminate, NaOH, hexanediamine, and distilled water, followed by stirring. After 1 h of settlement, this mixture was also transferred into the autoclave and heated at 160 °C for 24 h for the crystallization to complete. After crystallization, the product was filtered, washed with distilled water, dried at 80 °C, and calcined at 550 °C. The samples in acid form were obtained through treatment similar to that mentioned for the preparation of HZSM-5. The SnCl2 solid input was determined by the weight percentage of Sn (1.0 wt %) in the zeolite based on the silicasol.
Preparation of the Catalysts
PtNa/Sn-ZSM-5 and PtNa/HZSM-5 catalysts were prepared by a sequential impregnation method. First, the powder Sn-ZSM-5 or HZSM-5 was impregnated in an aqueous solution of 0.427 M NaCl. Subsequently, this sample was impregnated in a solution of 0.033 M H2PtCl6, followed by drying. The nominal compositions of the catalyst samples were 0.5 wt % for Pt and 1.0 wt % for Na.
PtSnNa/HZSM-5 catalyst was also prepared by a sequential impregnation method, described in detail elsewhere. (7, 16) The nominal compositions were 0.5 wt % for Pt, 1.0 wt % for Sn, and 1.0 wt % for Na, respectively.
To obtain larger and more resistant particles, all of the prepared samples were fully agglomerated with binders during the process of pelletization. (16) The spaghetti-shaped extrudates had a diameter of 1.5 mm and a length of 3–8 mm. After being totally dried, the catalysts were calcined at 500 °C for 4 h, dechlorinated at 500 °C for 4 h in air containing steam and then reduced under H2 at 500 °C for 8 h.
Catalyst Characterization
The metallic contents were obtained by X-ray fluorescence (XRF) measurements on a SWITZERLAND ARL9800 XRF and the crystal morphological of zeolite was investigated by SEM using S3400.
X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of the different samples were obtained on a XD-3A X-ray powder diffractometer coupled to a copper anode tube. The Kα radiation was selected with a diffracted beam monochromator. An angular range 2θ from 5° to 50° was recorded using step scanning and long counting times to determine the positions of the ZSM-5 peaks.
N2-adsorption studies were used to examine the porous properties of each sample. The measurements were carried out on Micromeritics ASAP 2000 adsorptive and desorptive apparatus, and all of the samples were pretreated in vacuum at 350 °C for 15 h before the measurements. The specific surface area was obtained using the BET method. The microporous volume was calculated from the t-plot method.
FT-IR spectra were recorded on a Nicolet Magna-IR 750 (USA) spectrometer. The samples were dried, and then mulled with KBr pellets.
Temperature-programmed desorption (TPD) measurements were carried out to determine the acid properties of zeolites by using ammonia as an adsorbate. About 0.15 g of sample was placed in a quartz reactor and saturated with ammonia at room temperature. TPD was carried out from 100 to 550 °C with a heating rate of 10 °C min–1 and with helium (30 mL min–1) as the carrier gas.
X-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS) measurements were carried out in a Thermo ESCALAB 250 instrument (U. S.) using nonmonochromatic Al Kα1486.6 radiation. All samples were reduced in situ under hydrogen at 500 °C for 1 h. Then the spectra were recorded at room temperature in a vacuum better than 5 × 10–9 mbar. The binding energy values of the XPS signals were calibrated by using the Si 2p peak at 102.9 eV as reference. (7)
Temperature-programmed reduction (TPR) was measured with the same apparatus as that of NH3-TPD. Prior to the TPR experiments, the catalysts were dried in flowing N2 at 400 °C for 1 h. Five % H2/N2 was used as the reducing gas at a flow rate of 40 mL min–1. The rate of temperature rise in the TPR experiment was 10 °C min–1 up to 750 °C.
Hydrogen TPD of the different samples was performed on the apparatus as described for TPR for 0.15 g of the sample placed in a quartz reactor. The catalyst was prereduced in flowing H2 at 500 °C for 1 h. When cooled to room temperature, desorptions were programmed at 10 °C min–1 to 650 °C in flowing N2.
Catalytic Evaluation
Propane dehydrogenation was carried out in a conventional quartz tubular microreactor with an inner diameter of 8 mm. The catalyst (mass 2.0 g) was placed into the center of the reactor. Reaction conditions were as follows: 590 °C for reaction temperature, 0.1 MPa for total pressure, H2/C3H8 = 0.25 (molar ratio) and the propane weight hourly space velocity (WHSV) is 3.0 h–1. The reaction products were analyzed with an online GC-14C gas chromatography.
Results and Discussion
Physicochemical Properties of the Zeolites
Figure 1 shows the XRD patterns of the different samples. Apparently, the representative peaks at 7°–9° and 23°–24° are shown in the XRD of HZSM-5, corresponding to that given in ref 17 for pure ZSM-5. For comparison, as for the tin system, the product stays crystalline after the substitution and is identified as a ZSM-5 type material. In addition, this sample shows no diffraction peaks of Sn species, probably due to the low level of substitution (18) or the high dispersion of Sn on the support.

The porous properties of the different samples obtained from N2 adsorption are illustrated in Table 1. There are no obvious changes in the surface area and the total pore volume between the Sn-ZSM-5 material and the parent sample. The possible reason may be that the clusters of metal are mainly extra-pore, thus the existence of Sn has little influence on the physical structure of the zeolites. Figure 2 represents the scanning electron micrographs of HZSM-5 and Sn-ZSM-5 samples. It can be seen that the HZSM-5 zeolite exhibits a typical MFI structure. “Boat-like” hexagonal-shaped crystal rods are quite uniform with crystal sizes of 6–8 μm in length. In comparison, the tin-substituted material has similarly sized crystals, but with deterioration in crystal quality. As shown in Figure 2(b), this sample shows the evidence of increasing aspect ratios, evidence of twinned crystals, and the appearance of raised faces. According to Round et al., (18) these features are consistent with isomorphous heteroatom substitution.

In order to further clarify the possibility of tin to incorporate into the framework of ZSM-5, FT-IR spectra have been tested. As shown in Figure 3, the tin-substituted sample shows broadening of the spectral bands, which is similar to those reported for nickel and cobalt series. (18, 19) Also, this material shows a distortion of the spectra between 1250 and 900 ν cm–1; this is the region of the spectrum assigned to asymmetrical T–O–T stretching and is indicative of heteroatom substitution. (20) Therefore, analysis of the material by FTIR spectroscopy again supports the heteroatom substitution.

Characterization of the Catalysts
The result of XRF analysis indicates that the percentage of Sn on PtNa/Sn-ZSM-5 catalyst is quite similar to that of the conventional PtSnNa/HZSM-5 one. This finding reveals that the different introduction method of Sn has little influence on the metallic content of the catalyst.
Figure 4 shows the NH3-TPD profiles of the different samples. As for the HZSM-5, there exists two ammonia desorption peaks: the first desorption peak at about 240 °C is assigned to the weak acid sites, whereas the second peak at about 450 °C corresponds to strong acid sites, in good agreement with the reported literature. (21) By contrast, after the loading of Pt and Na (Figure 4(2)), no high temperature desorption peak is found, indicating that the strong acid center on zeolite is preferentially neutralized by the added promoter. On the basis of our previous results, (16) this behavior is mainly associated with the effect of sodium. Besides, the existence of Sn is also able to reduce the weak acidity, evidenced from the decreased amount of ammonia desorbed on PtSnNa/HZSM-5 or PtNa/Sn-ZSM-5 catalyst. Clearly, this phenomenon may be explained by the basic nature of tin. (22) Concerning both tin-doped platinum catalysts, there are no obvious changes in the acidity (Figure 4(3),(4)), meaning that the introduction method of Sn does not significantly influence the acidic character of Pt/zolite catalyst.

Figure 5 shows the Sn3d XPS region for the different catalysts and the measured binding energies of the Si2p, Al2p, Sn3d5/2 levels are summarized in Table 2 after deconvolution of the spectra. It should first be noted that in both spectra, the component at binding energies of 485.3 and 485.9 eV can be found, which is associated with a reduced tin phase, either in the metallic (Sn0) or in the alloyed (SnPtx) state. (23) However, two other signals can be observed at 486.7 and 488 binding energies for PtSnNa/HZSM-5 catalyst, corresponding to SnO and/or SnO2. Unfortunately, the discrimination between SnO and SnO2 is not possible by means of the XPS studies alone. (24) Therefore, the main conclusion from this experiment is that the greatest amount of tin exists in oxidized form on PtSnNa/HZSM-5 catalyst. With regard to the tin-substituted sample, these two peaks are found at 486.9 and 488.1 eV binding energies, respectively, corresponding to the oxidized tin (SnO and/or SnO2). From the data compiled in Table 2, in this case, the percentages of Sn0 (23%) is much less than that of the PtSnNa/HZSM-5 catalyst (30%), meaning that more amounts of tin exist in a nonmetallic state (Sn4+ or Sn2+). As analysis above (Figure 3), on PtNa/Sn-ZSM-5 catalyst, some parts of Sn species can incorporate into the framework of ZSM-5 zeolite. Accordingly, the oxidized state of tin can be much steadier than that of the PtSnNa/HZSM-5 catalyst because of the strong interactions between Sn species and the support.

In order to study the influence of introduction method of Sn on the platinum and metal–support character, H2-TPD experiments were carried out. Figure 6 shows the H2-TPD profiles of the different catalysts. In general, low temperature desorption peaks are assigned to hydrogen on metallic Pt, whereas high temperature desorption peaks correspond to spillover hydrogen. (25) Moreover, it should be noted that the degree of spillover hydrogen is concerned with many factors and the M/A (M: the metallic active sites; A: the acceptor of spillover hydrogen) interface is the most important one to influence this. (22)
Figure 6
Figure 6. H2-TPD profiles of the different catalysts: (1) PtNa/HZSM-5; (2) PtSnNa/HZSM-5; and (3) PtNa/Sn-ZSM-5.
In comparison with PtNa/HZSM-5 catalyst, the promoter of Sn on the conventional PtSnNa/HZSM-5 catalyst decreases the peak area at low temperature; while promoting the catalytic ability to adsorb hydrogen in the high temperature range (Figure 6(2)). As reported, (22) the above reduced hydrogen desorption at low temperature can be most probably attributed to the “geometric effect” of Sn. Toward the increased amounts of hydrogen at high temperature, it can be concluded that the existence of Sn changes the interfacial character between Pt and the support. Moreover, as shown in Figure 6, more amounts of desorbed hydrogen of PtNa/Sn-ZSM-5 catalyst at high temperature are observed, suggesting that the presence of Sn on the structure of ZSM-5 is more favorable for the effect of Sn changing the interfacial character. In addition, when the spillover hydrogen occurs, the hydrogen can be dissociated to H atoms at the surface of Pt active sites. Then these atoms may overflow to the surface of adjacent Pt oxides or the other Pt oxides that interact with the carrier strongly. Therefore, the increased amounts of spillover hydrogen can promote the reduction of Pt oxides to some extent. (7) Following this mechanism, on PtNa/Sn-ZSM-5 catalyst, it is reasonable to deduce that the substitution of Sn can facilitate the reduction of Pt species. In this way, the active sites of the catalyst may be stabilized, which is advantageous to the reaction.

H2-TPR profiles of the different samples are presented in Figure 7. It is clear that no obvious reduction peak is observed for the HZSM-5 zeolite during the reduction process. Sn/HZSM-5 sample presents two reduction peaks: one peak around 380 °C and another broad peak around 560 °C. Two types of Sn oxides are generally considered in the literature: one in a weak interaction with the support and the other in a strong interaction with the support. (22) In contrast to this, the Sn-substituted sample (Sn-ZSM-5) also exhibits two reduction peaks, whereas the reduction temperature obviously shifts toward the higher range. This is a clear indication of the strong interaction established between Sn species and support. Apparently, this result is identical to the above XPS analysis (Figure 5). When the three components of Pt, Sn, and Na coexist (Figure 7(4)), the profile presents a peak, whose maximum is placed at about 250 °C, and other two peaks at about 460 and 560 °C, respectively. Usually, the signal at 250 °C is ascribed to reduction of Pt, whereas the high-temperature peaks is linked with the reduction of Sn4+ to Sn2+ and Sn2+ to Sn0, respectively. (26, 27) In the case of the PtNa/Sn-ZSM-5 catalyst, the amount of hydrogen consumption for Pt species decreases and the reduction temperature moves toward the higher range, suggesting that the reduction of Pt becomes more difficult. According to the above discussion (Figure 6), we can associate this reduction behavior with the stabilized active sites of the catalyst. Furthermore, in this case, it is interesting to note that the high reduction temperature of Sn species is about 610 °C, which is much higher than the corresponding one of the PtSnNa/HZSM-5 catalyst. This finding again implies that more strong interaction between Sn species and the support can exist as the Sn-ZSM-5 zeolite is used as the support.

Figure 8 shows the catalytic performances of the different catalysts. As it can be observed, PtNa/HZSM-5 catalyst exhibits relatively poor reaction activity and stability. Meanwhile, the selectivity to propene increases progressively. Clearly, this phenomenon can be interpreted in terms of the effect of produced coke. In this case, the carbon depositions may act as a promoter to improve the selectivity by deactivating the active sites. In contrast, the catalytic activity, stability and selectivity increase obviously with the presence of Sn. From Table 3, the deactivation parameter of the conventional PtSnNa/HZSM-5 catalyst is only 69.4% with that of the PtNa/HZSM-5 one. Moreover, the incorporation of Sn into the structure of ZSM-5 produces a noticeable increase in the catalytic activity. To this Sn-containing catalyst, the initial conversion of propane reaches the highest value of 41.7%. In fact, in our experiments, the behavior of PtNa/Sn-ZSM-5 catalyst merits to be highlighted, it exhibits the lowest deactivation parameter (6.2%) and shows a selectivity to propene higher than 98% with the corresponding propane conversion of about 39.0% after the reaction for 9 h.

PtSnNa/HZSM-5 39.7 37.0 6.8
PtNa/Sn-ZSM-5 41.7 39.1 6.2
To explain this, it should be noted that Pt/ZSM-5 catalyst is bifunctional and two active centers (the metal particles and the acid sites) may work collaboratively. (28) At the same time, it is known that on Pt/ZSM-5 catalyst, platinum is the only active metal and the propene is only formed on the metal by dehydrogenation; the main cracking product (ethene) is mainly formed from cracking on the carrier and the ethane is formed by hydrogenolysis of propane and by hydrogenation of ethene, with both reactions taking place on the metal. (29) Furthermore, on HMFI zeolite the dehydrogenation and cracking of propane are assumed to proceed through carbonium-ion intermediates. (30) The higher acid sites generally promote the subsequent cracking reaction of the initially formed C3+carbenium ions. Therefore, the change of catalyst acidity and character of Pt active sites may influence the catalytic performances effectively. Respect to PtNa/HZSM-5 catalyst, the acid amount (Figure 4) is relatively large and the platinum particles disperse directly on the support. In this case, hydrogenolysis and coke reaction can be carried out easily, because these unwanted reactions require relatively large platinum ensembles. (31) After the addition of tin, both the catalyst acidity and the size of the surface Pt ensembles decrease. In these circumstances, the decreased acidity minimizes the undesirable side reactions and the decreased particle size can also increase the catalytic activity and selectivity, since the desired dehydrogenation reaction can proceed on small ensembles of surface platinum atoms. (32) Concerning the PtNa/Sn-ZSM-5 catalyst, the incorporation of Sn into the framework of the ZSM-5 zeolite results in a strong interaction between tin species and the support. Accordingly, more amounts of tin can exist in oxidized form (Figure 5(b)), which is favorable for the anchoring of Pt to Sn oxide. Generally, on supported Pt catalyst, the Pt site in which Pt anchors Sn oxide surface with a “sandwich structure” is the main reaction active sites. (33) However, the substitution of Sn is favorable for the effect of Sn changing the interfacial character between Pt and the support, which in consequence promotes the occurrence of spillover hydrogen. In this case, more stabilized active sites of the catalyst can be obtained. In summary, compared with the conventional PtSnNa/HZSM-5 catalyst, the incorporation of Sn species into the silica framework of ZSM-5 exhibits a higher stable state of Sn, thus the reduction of this promoter under the hydrogen atmosphere at high reaction temperature becomes more difficult. In this way, the matching between the Pt active sites and the acid function can be the best, which is advantageous to the dehydrogenation of propane.
Table 4 lists the most related (to the present study) literature data over the different Pt catalysts for propane dehydrogenation. Clearly, an attempt to correlate our results with the literature data over a variety of catalysts is a relatively difficult task because of the different catalyst compositions and reaction conditions. Therefore, the correlations must be treated with caution. (9) Despite differences mentioned above, the PtNa/Sn-ZSM-5 catalyst used in this work shows better catalytic performance (with respect to the conversion and selectivity) than most of the catalysts. Furthermore, the performance comparison of the PtNa/Sn-ZSM-5 and PtSnNa/HZSM-5 catalysts by using a recycle reaction is also carried out at the temperature of 590 °C (Figure S1 of the Supporting Information, SI). It is worthy noting that the deactivation rate of the PtSnNa/H-ZSM-5 catalyst is much faster than that of the PtNa/Sn-ZSM-5 one with the increase of recycle number. On the basis of the result of stability test of the PtNa/Sn-ZSM-5 catalyst (Figure S2 of the SI), a high value of propene selectivity (98.6%) and an average yield of propene (about 30.3%) are obtained during the course of the reaction of 75 h. Accordingly, it can be concluded that Sn-modified ZSM-5 zeolite is an attractive support material than the pure ZSM-5 to stabilize Pt active metals and to derive its optimum catalytic activity for the dehydrogenation of propane.

Conclusions
The Sn modified ZSM-5 zeolites have been hydrothermally synthesized and then this kind of zeolite has been used as the support for platinum catalyst in propane dehydrogenation. The catalytic performances of this catalyst are also compared to those of the conventional PtNa/HZSM-5 and PtSnNa/HZSM-5 ones.
In this tin-substituted material, XRD analysis establishes the presence of highly crystalline and the analysis by SEM shows the deterioration in crystal quality. The acid amounts of the both Sn-doped catalysts are almost the same. Interestingly, the incorporation of Sn species results in the strong interactions between Sn species and the support, thereby more amounts of tin can exist in oxidized form. Furthermore, the presence of Sn on the structure of ZSM-5 is favorable for the effect of Sn. Therefore, the active sites of the catalyst can be stabilized. In our experiments, this Sn-doped ZSM-5-based Pt catalyst exhibits an excellent behavior in the dehydrogenation of propane to propene. It exhibits the lowest deactivation parameter (6.2%) and shows a selectivity to propene higher than 98% with the corresponding propane conversion of about 39.0% after the reaction for 9 h. The stability test of this catalyst shows that an average yield of propene (about 30.3%) is obtained during the course of the reaction of 75 h.
