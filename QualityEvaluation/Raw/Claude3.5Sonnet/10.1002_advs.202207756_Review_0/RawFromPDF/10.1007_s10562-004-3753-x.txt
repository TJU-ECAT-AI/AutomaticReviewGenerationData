The activation of a dimethylgallium/ZSM-5 precursor to well-deﬁned reduced and oxidized species is studied by in situ Ga K
edge XANES. The precursor is prepared by chemical implanting of trimethylgallium on acidic HZSM-5. Subsequent reduction
leads to charge-compensating Ga+ species. Direct oxidation of the trimethylgallium precursor leads to various forms of gallium
oxide and regeneration of Brønsted acid protons. Oxidation of the reduced Ga+ species yields predominantly to GaO+ species.
The GaO+ species exhibit a much higher H2/D2 exchange activity than reduced Ga+ species.

1. Introduction
Gallium dispersed in acid materials can be applied to
dehydrogenate alkanes. In combination with the shape-
selective properties of a medium-pore zeolite such as
ZSM-5, light paraﬃns can be converted into aromatic
hydrocarbons including benzene, toluene and xylenes.
A commercial application is found in the Cyclar pro-
cess [1,2]. The reaction mechanism is thought to consist
of a complex scheme involving dehydrogenation, olig-
omerization and ring-closure steps. Despite consider-
able research eﬀorts in the area of Ga-containing
zeolites [3–11], the exact role of gallium in this mech-
anism has not been totally elucidated yet, with pro-
posals for its role as dehydrogenation function in a
pure bifunctional [3–6] or concerted mechanism [7] and
as a promoter to recombinative hydrogen removal
during alkane dehydrogenation on Brønsted acid sites
[8–11] receiving most attention. The structure of the
active intrazeolite Ga species and their reactivity in
oxidative and reductive conditions has not been fully
resolved yet, owing to the wide variety of possible
structures including bulk Ga2O3 aggregates on the
external zeolite surface, small gallium oxide aggregates
occluded in the zeolite micropore space, reduced Ga
species such as Ga2O and cationic Ga species in oxi-
dized or reduced form. Various methods to incorporate
extra-framework gallium into the micropore space of
HZSM-5 have been described [12] including impreg-
nation [13,14] and ion-exchange [15] with Ga3+ salts,
physical mixing with Ga2O3 [16] and chemical vapor
deposition (CVD) of GaCl3 [17,18]. Impregnation, ion-
exchange and physical mixing lead to poorly dispersed
gallium oxide species, mostly present on the external
zeolite surface. The dispersion can be increased by
reduction of the gallium oxide [12], resulting in the
formation of Ga+ species [14,16] or GaH2
+ species [14]
compensating the zeolite framework charge. The role of
these reduced Ga+ species with respect to dehydroge-
nation is not clear [16,19]. However, the reduction to
Ga+ entities goes with a decrease in the Brønsted
acidity [5,14], which will in turn strongly aﬀect the
overall performance in hydrocarbon reactions. The
hydrolysis step after CVD of gallium chloride also leads
to a variety of Ga species including GaO+ cations and
Ga2O3 species [18,20].
In order to prepare better-deﬁned Ga species in
medium-pore zeolites we have recently examined the
CVD of trimethylgallium (TMG) in HZSM-5 and
HMOR [21]. In short, TMG can eﬀectively replace the
Brønsted acid protons in HZSM-5, resulting in mono-
nuclear dimethylgallium species. Here, we report an in
situ X-ray absorption near-edge spectroscopy (XANES)
study of the thermal activation of these species. Acti-
vation was carried out by reduction with molecular
hydrogen because this results in better-deﬁned species
compared to an oxidative pretreatment [21]. Neverthe-
less, we will also address the oxidation of the zeolite-
occluded gallium alkyl species. A previous Ga K edge
XAS study [10] indicated that the oxidation state of the
reduced Ga species changes upon cooling indicating that
in situ studies at relatively high temperatures are a pre-
requisite. Therefore, we studied the catalytic materials
by XANES under conditions relevant to catalysis.

2. Experimental
2.1. Preparation
TMG/ZSM-5 catalyst was synthesized by CVD of
TMG (Aldrich, 99%) on HZSM-5 zeolite. To a glass
vessel containing well-dried HZSM-5 zeolite (Akzo
Nobel, Si/Al = 19.4), 1 ml of TMG was added in an
Ar-ﬂushed glove-box. After 24 h, the resulting material
was evacuated for 2 h to remove unreacted TMG and
gaseous
reaction
products,
mainly
methane.
The
resulting material was kept in argon atmosphere prior to
XANES characterization. The gallium loading was
found to be 6.8 wt% by ICP analysis.
2.2. Characterization
X-ray absorption spectra were recorded at beamline
BL17C
of
the
National
Synchrotron
Radiation
Research Center (NSRRC), Taiwan. The storage ring
energy was operated at 1.5 GeV with the beam current
between 120 and 200 mA. Absorption spectra were
measured in transmission mode. The energy was scan-
ned from 200 and 20 eV below the Ga K absorption
edge (10,367 eV) to 1000 and 60 eV above the edge for
EXAFS analysis and in situ XANES experiments,
respectively. Standard Ga2O3 powder was used as a
reference and measured simultaneously with the sample.
Samples were mounted in an controlled atmosphere
transmission cell under exclusion of contact with air.
The as-prepared sample was reduced in a ﬂow of
100 ml min)1 (20 vol% hydrogen in helium) at a rate of
4 K min)1 to 773 K. After an isothermal period of
10 min, the cell was ﬂushed with He. Subsequently, the
sample was exposed to a ﬂow of 100 ml min)1 of 20
vol% oxygen in helium for 10 min, followed again by a
reduction at this temperature for 10 min. During these
steps, near-edge spectra were recorded at regular time
intervals. For some catalysts, EXAFS spectra were
recorded after cooling to room temperature. The data
analysis was carried out with the UWXAFS 3.0 and
FEFF8 software packages. Structural information was
determined by multiple-shell ﬁtting in R-space. Both k2-
and k3-weighted Fourier transformation without phase
correction were performed. As input to FEFF8, a
known atom cluster from the reference b-Ga2O3 com-
pound and interatomic distances from the published
crystal structure were used [22].
FTIR spectroscopy was carried out with a Bruker
IFS113v
spectrometer
in
a
controlled
atmosphere
transmission cell. A wafer of approximately 10 mg of
TMG/ZSM-5 was pressed and loaded into the cell.
Spectra were recorded for TMG/ZSM-5 after evacua-
tion for 120 min, after reduction at 823 K or after oxi-
dation at 823 K. The spectrum of the dehydrated parent
HZSM-5 material is given for comparison.
27Al MAS NMR measurements were carried out on a
Bruker DMX500 spectrometer operating at 130.3 MHz.
The sample was rotated in a 4 mm rotor with a spin rate
of 12.5 kHz. Single-pulse excitation was used with a 30
pulse of 1.5 ls. Thousand scans were accumulated with
a time resolution of 5 ls (100 kHz spectral width) and
interscan delay of 1 s. A solution of A1(NO3)3 was used
for shift calibration.
2.3. H2/D2 equilibration
Hydrogen–deuterium exchange was measured in a
quartz batch reactor equipped with a quadrupole mass
spectrometer (Balzers QMS 200 M system). Prior to
reaction, the catalyst was loaded and pretreated in
hydrogen or oxygen whilst heating from room temper-
ature to 773 K at a heating rate of 2 K min)1. During
pretreatment, the evolution of decomposition gases of
the precursor was followed by the mass spectrometer.
After evacuation and cooling to the reaction tempera-
ture of 573 K, equimolar amounts of hydrogen, deute-
rium and nitrogen (each 1 kPa) were admitted to
reactor. The evolution of the reaction gases (H2, D2 and
HD) was followed by the mass spectrometer for 20 h.
3. Results and discussion
Fourier transforms of k3-weighted EXAFS spectra of
the Ga2O3 reference, the as-synthesized TMG/ZSM-5
and the material after reduction and oxidation are

Ga2O3 reference compound indicates a ratio of Ga(t)/
Ga(o) = (1.7/4)/(3.1/6)  0.8. This ratio is calculated
from the coordination number of Ga–O bonds with a

and a Ga(o)–O distance of R = 1.99 

in good agreement with earlier EXAFS and XRD
studies [23,24]. The data are also in good agreement with
a separate XANES analysis of the edge, giving Ga(t)/
Ga(o) = 0.73. The lower than unity ratio suggests that
the reference is not a ideal b-form of Ga2O3 [25,26].
The as-synthesized sample contains Ga atoms coor-
dinating to oxygen and carbon atoms. Although we
earlier calculated a minimum-energy conﬁguration of
dimethylgallium coordinating to two zeolite framework
oxygen atoms [21], the present EXAFS ﬁt parameters
point to the coordination of the dimethylgallium species
to a single oxygen atom. This suggests that the Ga-alkyl
species binds more strongly to one of the oxygen atoms
while a weaker bond with the other surrounding oxygen
atoms may not be detected by EXAFS. The Ga–C bond
distance of R = 1.95 A
˚ is in good agreement to values
around 1.96 A
˚ obtained for TMG [27,28]. There is also
a backscatterer visible at R = 2.92 A
˚
which is most
probably due to Ga–Si and Ga–Al.
Figure 2 displays XANES spectra of TMG/ZSM-5
materials during in situ reduction. We infer that the
distinct absorption feature in as-synthesized TMG/
ZSM-5 belongs to Ozeolite–Ga(CH3)2 species. The lower
edge energy of the dimethylgallium species coordinating
to the zeolite framework compared to the reference
compound is caused by the presence of the two alkyl
groups which results in a partial reduction of Ga3+. The
other weaker absorption maximum around 10,381 eV
might be due to Ga-alkyl species interacting with silanol
groups. The XANES spectra during reduction of TMG/
ZSM-5 do not point to large changes of the gallium
oxidation state up to a temperature of about 650 K. At
this temperature, the maximum of the absorption fea-
ture at 10,375 eV shifts to lower energies and the max-
imum of the absorption feature around 10,381 eV shifts
to 10,379 eV. The shift of the edge energy during the
reductive treatment can be followed in ﬁgure 3. The
edge energy is constant (10,373 eV) up to a temperature
of 640 K and then shifts to lower energy (10,371.5 eV).
During further reduction at 773 K, the edge energy does
not change anymore. We attribute the shift in edge
energy to the reduction of dimethylgallium to monova-
lent Ga+ species. The other Ga species can only be
slightly reduced as is evident from the decrease of the
absorption maximum to 10,379 eV similar to earlier
work on Ga-beta [22].
The reduction process is further monitored by a
separate
temperature-programmed
reduction
experi-
ment. Figure 4 shows the evolution of methane as a
function of temperature. We observe a small feature
around 400 K which we tentatively attribute to some
further reaction of physisorbed TMG with remaining

hydroxyl groups. A main production peak of methane
with a maximum at 673 K is also observed. Methane
production already starts around 600 K. These results
are in good agreement with the shift of the edge energy
around 640 K. Moreover, we observed the production
of very small amounts of ethane, propane and carbon
dioxide (alkanes typically two orders of magnitude
lower than the amount of methane, carbon dioxide three
orders
of
magnitude
lower)
during
the
reductive
decomposition of the precursor. We speculate that gal-
lium is present as monovalent Ga+ species since we have
recently found GaH2
+ species is not stable under the
present
reaction
conditions
[14].
Upon
oxidation,
mainly carbon dioxide and water is produced around
773 K with small amounts of hydrocarbons, mostly
ethane, and hydrogen being released at lower tempera-
tures. This suggests that the alkyl groups eliminated as
hydrocarbons
and
can
be
dehydrogenated
giving
hydrogen and coke depositions that are burned at higher
temperatures. The coke deposition is conﬁrmed by the
observation that the material has turned black below
773 K. The subsequent oxidation of this coke deposit
results in the formation of carbon dioxide and water.
This also provides an explanation for the higher amount
of extraframework Al species derived from the higher
intensity of the resonance around 0 ppm for oxidized
TMG/ZSM-5 compared to the reduced precursor in the
27Al NMR spectra (ﬁgure 5). We also observe that the
vapor deposition of TMG only leads to a small degree of
dealumination but that subsequent activation and most
prominently oxidation increases the amount of octahe-
dral Al species. The reduced catalyst also has some
distorted (penta-coordinated) Al species between the
sharper resonances at 54 and 0 ppm. This could be due
to close interaction with reduced Ga species. One has to
be careful with the interpretation of these 27Al NMR
spectra because they were recorded after re-exposure to
air. This will particularly aﬀect the as-synthesized and
reduced catalysts. This could also explain the larger
diﬀerence in dealumination degree as derived from
infrared spectroscopy compared to
27Al NMR (vide
infra).
Meitzner et al. [10] reported the formation of reduced
Ga species on Ga/HZSM-5 prepared by impregnation of
gallium nitrate followed by air calcination upon reduc-
tion at 780 K. Clearly, the gallium alkyl precursor can
be reduced at a considerably lower temperature than the
gallium oxide one. Figure 6 presents XANES spectra of
the material after reduction at 773 K and subsequent
oxidative and reductive treatments at 773 K. One
observes that oxidation at 773 K leads to dramatic
changes in the XANES region. The edge energy shifts to
a value of 10,374.5 eV indicating the oxidation of the Ga
species to Ga3+. We surmise that the oxidation of
monovalent Ga+ results in the formation of [GaO]+,
although one should also consider the possibility that
small gallium oxide clusters form concomitant with the
regeneration of acid protons. Dooley et al. [15] have
shown that oxidation of reduced Ga species is fast at
823 K but does not proceed to b-Ga2O3. The diﬀerence
in reducibility between the dimethylgallium precursor
and the oxidized Ga species is expressed by the minor
extent of reduction of the latter species upon exposure to
hydrogen at 773 K. Figure 6 shows that such treatment
only leads to a weak shoulder on the low energy side
indicating that the oxidized species cannot be reduced
easily under these conditions. We also performed an
EXAFS analysis of the oxidized sample that was addi-
tionally reduced for 10 min. The structural parameters
of TMG/ZSM-5(red. + ox.) are given in table 1. We
could ﬁt these data with two models. In the ﬁrst coor-
dination shell of model I, we ﬁnd three oxygen atoms,
two oxygen atoms at a distance of R = 1.98 A
˚ which
we attribute to coordination of Ga to the framework
oxygen atoms and one shorter bond with R = 1.80 A
˚ .
This could be due to a terminal oxygen atom that is

more strongly bonded to the Ga3+ atom than the two
zeolite oxygen atoms. The structural parameters for the
oxidized material cohere well with our surmise that the
larger part of gallium is present as [Ga3+ = O2)]+
(gallyl) species coordinating to the negative framework
charge of the zeolite. We also identiﬁed a Ga–Al (Ga–Si)
backscatterer which is in line with the coordination of
the GaO+ species to the zeolite framework. On the
other hand, we could also produce a satisfactory ﬁt with
four oxygen atoms at a distance of R = 1.83 A
˚ and a
Ga–Al coordination at R = 3.07 A
˚ . This latter result
could point to the presence of charge-compensating
Ga(OH)2
+ instead of GaO+ species but in principle
could also be interpreted in terms of reinsertion of Ga
into the zeolite framework.
A comparison of the FTIR spectra of the parent
HZSM-5 material and the as-synthesized material (ﬁg-
ure 7) shows that TMG has reacted with all hydroxyl
groups,
i.e.
the
Brønsted
acid
hydroxyl
groups
(3610 cm)1), the hydroxyl groups related to extra-
framework Al (3665 cm)1) and the silanol groups
(3740 cm)1) in line with an earlier analysis [21]. A direct
oxidative treatment results in considerable regeneration
of Brønsted acid protons and a substantial regeneration
of the silanol groups. The regeneration of about 60% of

the original amount of bridging hydroxyl groups indi-
cates that a considerable amount of the gallium species
has been transformed into neutral gallium oxide species
occluded in the zeolite micropores as small or on the
external surface as larger aggregates. Moreover, we note
that the band related to hydroxyl groups coordinating to
extraframework Al species has increased considerably
and is higher than in the original material. This points to
extensive dealumination during the oxidative treatment
deriving from steaming eﬀects by water produced at
elevated temperatures produced by oxidation of hydro-
carbons or hydrocarbon residue. The band also appears
to be broader which might relate to the occurrence of
hydroxyl groups coordinating to extraframework Ga
ions that give rise to a vibrational band around
3680 cm)1. The IR spectrum of the reduced material
shows no regeneration of the acid protons suggesting
that all exchange sites are occupied by reduced Ga
species. The ﬁnal spectrum is the one of a catalyst that
was oxidized at 823 K after reduction of TMG/ZSM-5.
The spectrum resembles that of oxidized TMG/ZSM-
precursor albeit that the extent of regeneration of
Brønsted acid protons amounts to about 15% which is
considerably lower than after direct oxidation. This
indicates that the latter sample predominantly contains
[GaO]+ species. One also observes a band due to OH
groups on extraframework Ga species which could mean
that part of the charge-compensating ions are present in
the form of Ga(OH)2
+ species. Table 2 shows the
hydrogen–deuterium equilibration activities of HZSM-5
and reduced and oxidized TMG/ZSM-5 at a reaction
temperature of 573 K. Clearly, gallium acts as a pro-
moter for the isotopic exchange between H2 and D2
compared to the HZSM-5 parent zeolite. However,
oxidized TMG/ZSM-5 shows a three-fold higher activity
than the reduced material. This suggests that the
reduced Ga+ species exhibit a lower reactivity in
hydrogen activation than gallium oxide species. It is
diﬃcult to ascertain whether the higher activity of the
oxidized materials should be attributed to [GaO]+ spe-
cies or gallium oxide microaggregates. To obtain more
insight into this, we compared the equilibration activi-
ties of two oxidized materials, i.e. the ﬁrst one obtained
during direct oxidation of TMG/ZSM-5 and the second
one obtained after oxidation of the reduced precursor.
From the considerably higher activity of the catalyst
that contains a lower amount of Brønsted acid protons
and hence a higher fraction of cationic species, we infer
that [GaO]+ species exhibit a higher activity than the
small gallium oxide clusters. This may be simply related
to the higher dispersion of the mononuclear Ga species.
Recently, we have shown that GaH2
+ species may form
upon exposure of Ga+ species following
ZO    Gaþ þ H2 ¡ ZO    GaHþ
2 ;
where ZO) stands for the anionic exchange site of the
zeolite [14]. Two hydride ions coordinate to tervalent Ga
species yielding a positively-charged cationic complex.
These species were shown to occur under the condi-
tions applied for the isotopic exchange reaction [14].
Moreover, they form relatively slowly and are stable up
to high temperature. Apparently, the dissociation of
hydrogen on the GaO+ species via
ZO    GaOþ þ H2 ¡ ZO    HGaOHþ
proceeds faster. This also has implications for the acti-
vation of paraﬃnic hydrocarbons. Heterolytic dissocia-
tion of hydrocarbons over GaO+ species may be
preferred over the homolytic dissociation over Ga+
species. First-principles calculations of Frash and van
Santen [29] indicate that ethane activation is most likely
to occur on GaH2
+ species. However, recent experi-
mental ﬁndings [14] show that GaH2
+ species are not
stable and decompose to Ga+ species at typical reaction
temperatures (T = 823 K). We surmise that the rate of
alkane activation over Ga+ is small, most likely due to
the weak interaction of Ga+ with hydrocarbons. On the
other hand, the activation of a hydrocarbon like ethane
over GaO+ species may occur via a [GaHOC2H5]+
intermediate which decomposes into ethylene and [Ga-
HOH]+. The activation energy for the regeneration of
the gallyl (GaO+) ion from the latter species was cal-
culated to be very high [29]. We surmise that desorption
of water under reductive conditions is more likely,
leading to the formation of Ga+ species rather than
regeneration of GaO+ species.
4. Conclusions
The adsorption of Ga(CH3)3 on HZSM-5 results in
the formation of chemisorbed Ga(CH3)2
+ cations.
These chemisorbed Ga(CH3)2
+ ions replace the Brøns-
ted acid protons. An EXAFS structure analysis of the
as-synthesized material shows that a dimethylgallium
species is formed that coordinates to the zeolite frame-
work. In situ XANES data shows that the reduction of
these Ga–alkyl species starts around 640 K and leads to
the formation of reduced Ga+ species. The oxidation of
these reduced species occurs very fast in the presence of
molecular oxygen, mostly leading to Ga 3+ species in
