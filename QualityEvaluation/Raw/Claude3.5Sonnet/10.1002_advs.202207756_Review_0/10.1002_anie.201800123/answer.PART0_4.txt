The growing demand for propylene has led to the development of new production methods, particularly propane dehydrogenation (PDH). This shift has been driven by the increasing production of shale gas, which has made propane more affordable and PDH more commercially viable for on-purpose propylene production.

Traditional industrial PDH catalysts, such as Pt- and CrOx-based catalysts, have limitations due to their high cost and toxicity. As a result, supported vanadium catalysts have emerged as a promising alternative due to their considerable activity, proper propylene selectivity, and excellent regeneration performance.

However, the literature provided does not contain specific information about Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts for PDH, the ongoing debate about active Ga species, or recent research findings related to these catalysts. The focus of the given text is primarily on vanadium-based catalysts for PDH.

丙烯需求的增长推动了新生产方法的发展，特别是丙烷脱氢（PDH）。这一转变是由页岩气产量的增加推动的，使得丙烷价格更加实惠，PDH在定向丙烯生产中的商业可行性也随之提高。

传统的工业PDH催化剂，如基于Pt和CrOx的催化剂，因其高成本和毒性而受到限制。因此，负载型钒催化剂作为一种有前景的替代品出现，因为它具有相当高的活性、适当的丙烯选择性和出色的再生性能。

然而，提供的文献中并不包含关于Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂用于PDH的具体信息，也没有涉及关于活性Ga物种的持续争论，或者与这些催化剂相关的最新研究发现。给定文本主要集中在基于钒的PDH催化剂上。
