[1] "Propylene (C3H6) is a crucial organic feedstock for a large number of chemicals in the petrochemical industry. (1) However, it is currently faced with a serious supply deficit because of the rapid growth in market demand for C3H6 derivatives."

[2] "At present, propylene is mainly produced by steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) of naphtha, light diesel, and other oil byproducts, as well as direct dehydrogenation of propane (DHP)."

[3] "Alternatively, oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) is attractive because of its exothermicity, which makes it free from the thermodynamic restraint at lower temperatures."

The growing demand for propylene has created a supply deficit, driving the development of new production methods beyond traditional steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking. Direct dehydrogenation of propane (DHP) has emerged as one of the main production routes to address this deficit. Additionally, oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) has gained attention as an attractive alternative due to its exothermic nature, which allows it to operate without thermodynamic constraints at lower temperatures.

The literature does not provide specific information about the evolution of understanding Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts for PDH or ongoing debates about active Ga species. Therefore, this part of the question cannot be answered based on the given text.

丙烯需求的增长导致了供应短缺，推动了新生产方法的开发，超越了传统的蒸汽裂解和流化催化裂解。丙烷直接脱氢(DHP)已成为解决这一短缺的主要生产路线之一。此外，由于丙烷氧化脱氢(ODHP)具有放热性质，可在较低温度下不受热力学限制运行，因此引起了人们的关注，成为一种有吸引力的替代方法。

文献中没有提供关于Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂用于PDH的理解演变或活性Ga物种的持续争论的具体信息。因此，基于给定的文本无法回答问题的这一部分。
