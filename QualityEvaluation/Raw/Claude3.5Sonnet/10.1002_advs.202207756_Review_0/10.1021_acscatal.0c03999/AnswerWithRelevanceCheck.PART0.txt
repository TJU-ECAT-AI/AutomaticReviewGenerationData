          [1] "Propylene (C3H6) is a crucial organic feedstock for a large number of chemicals in the petrochemical industry. (1) However, it is currently faced with a serious supply deficit because of the rapid growth in market demand for C3H6 derivatives."

[2] "At present, propylene is mainly produced by steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) of naphtha, light diesel, and other oil byproducts, as well as direct dehydrogenation of propane (DHP)."

[3] "Yet, the dehydrogenation process suffers from two inherent drawbacks: (i) the endothermicity-induced thermodynamic limit for C3H8 conversion that demands high-energy input and (ii) the rapid catalyst deactivation because of coke formation."

[4] "Alternatively, oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) is attractive because of its exothermicity, which makes it free from the thermodynamic restraint at lower temperatures."

          The growing demand for propylene has led to a serious supply deficit, driving the development of new production methods beyond traditional steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking of naphtha and other oil byproducts. Direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) has emerged as an important alternative production method. However, PDH faces challenges including high energy requirements due to the endothermic nature of the reaction, and rapid catalyst deactivation from coke formation.

Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) has gained attention as an attractive alternative due to its exothermic nature, which allows it to operate without thermodynamic constraints at lower temperatures.

The literature does not provide specific information about the evolution of understanding regarding Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts for PDH, ongoing debates about active Ga species, or recent research findings contributing to current knowledge of these catalysts. The document focuses more broadly on oxidative dehydrogenation using various soft oxidants rather than providing details on Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts for direct dehydrogenation.

          丙烯需求的增长导致了严重的供应短缺，推动了新生产方法的发展，超越了传统的蒸汽裂解和石脑油及其他油品副产品的流化催化裂解。丙烷直接脱氢(PDH)已成为一种重要的替代生产方法。然而，PDH面临着一些挑战，包括由于反应的吸热性质而导致的高能耗需求，以及由于积碳形成导致的催化剂快速失活。

丙烷氧化脱氢(ODHP)由于其放热性质而引起关注，成为一种有吸引力的替代方法，可在较低温度下不受热力学限制运行。

文献中没有提供关于Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂在PDH中的理解演变、活性Ga物种的持续争论，或近期研究发现对这些催化剂的当前知识贡献的具体信息。该文档更多地关注于使用各种软氧化剂进行氧化脱氢，而不是提供Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂用于直接脱氢的详细信息。
