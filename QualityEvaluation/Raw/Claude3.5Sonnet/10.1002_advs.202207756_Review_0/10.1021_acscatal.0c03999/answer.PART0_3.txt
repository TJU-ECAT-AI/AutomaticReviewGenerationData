[1] "Propylene (C3H6) is a crucial organic feedstock for a large number of chemicals in the petrochemical industry. (1) However, it is currently faced with a serious supply deficit because of the rapid growth in market demand for C3H6 derivatives."

[2] "At present, propylene is mainly produced by steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) of naphtha, light diesel, and other oil byproducts, as well as direct dehydrogenation of propane (DHP)."

[3] "Yet, the dehydrogenation process suffers from two inherent drawbacks: (i) the endothermicity-induced thermodynamic limit for C3H8 conversion that demands high-energy input and (ii) the rapid catalyst deactivation because of coke formation."

The growing demand for propylene has led to a serious supply deficit, driving the development of new production methods like propane dehydrogenation (PDH). Traditional methods such as steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking of naphtha and other oil byproducts are no longer sufficient to meet the increasing demand. PDH has emerged as a promising alternative, but it faces challenges including high energy requirements due to the endothermic nature of the reaction and rapid catalyst deactivation from coke formation.

Regarding Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts for PDH, the literature does not provide specific information about the evolution of understanding or the debate about active Ga species. The document focuses more broadly on various catalysts and oxidants for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane, rather than providing detailed information about Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts for direct propane dehydrogenation.

丙烯需求的增长导致了严重的供应短缺，推动了新生产方法如丙烷脱氢(PDH)的发展。传统方法如蒸汽裂解和石脑油及其他油品副产品的流化催化裂解已不足以满足不断增长的需求。PDH作为一种有前途的替代方法出现，但它面临着挑战，包括由于反应的吸热性质而导致的高能耗要求，以及由于积碳形成而导致的催化剂快速失活。

关于Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂用于PDH，文献没有提供关于理解演变或活性Ga物种争论的具体信息。该文档更多地关注了各种催化剂和氧化剂用于丙烷氧化脱氢，而不是提供关于Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂用于直接丙烷脱氢的详细信息。
