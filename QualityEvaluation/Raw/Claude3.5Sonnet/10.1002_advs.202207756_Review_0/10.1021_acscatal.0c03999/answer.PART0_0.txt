[1] "Propylene (C3H6) is a crucial organic feedstock for a large number of chemicals in the petrochemical industry. (1) However, it is currently faced with a serious supply deficit because of the rapid growth in market demand for C3H6 derivatives."

[2] "At present, propylene is mainly produced by steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) of naphtha, light diesel, and other oil byproducts, as well as direct dehydrogenation of propane (DHP)."

[3] "Yet, the dehydrogenation process suffers from two inherent drawbacks: (i) the endothermicity-induced thermodynamic limit for C3H8 conversion that demands high-energy input and (ii) the rapid catalyst deactivation because of coke formation."

The growing demand for propylene has led to a serious supply deficit, spurring the development of new production methods like propane dehydrogenation (PDH). Traditional methods such as steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking of oil byproducts are no longer sufficient to meet the increasing demand for propylene derivatives.

PDH has emerged as a promising alternative method for propylene production. However, it faces challenges including high energy requirements due to the endothermic nature of the reaction, and rapid catalyst deactivation caused by coke formation.

The literature does not provide specific information about the evolution of understanding Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts for PDH or recent research findings regarding active Ga species. Therefore, this part of the question cannot be answered based on the given text.

丙烯需求的增长导致了严重的供应短缺，促使新的生产方法如丙烷脱氢(PDH)的发展。传统方法如蒸汽裂解和油品副产品的流化催化裂解已不足以满足丙烯衍生物日益增长的需求。

PDH作为一种有前景的替代方法emerged出来用于丙烯生产。然而，它面临着一些挑战，包括由于反应的吸热性质而导致的高能耗要求，以及由于积碳形成导致的催化剂快速失活。

文献中没有提供关于Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂在PDH中的理解演变或最近关于活性Ga物种研究发现的具体信息。因此，基于给定的文本无法回答问题的这一部分。
