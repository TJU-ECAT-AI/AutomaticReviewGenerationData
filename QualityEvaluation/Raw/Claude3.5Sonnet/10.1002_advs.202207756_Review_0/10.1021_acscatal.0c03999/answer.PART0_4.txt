[1] "Propylene (C3H6) is a crucial organic feedstock for a large number of chemicals in the petrochemical industry. (1) However, it is currently faced with a serious supply deficit because of the rapid growth in market demand for C3H6 derivatives. (2)"

[2] "At present, propylene is mainly produced by steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) of naphtha, light diesel, and other oil byproducts, as well as direct dehydrogenation of propane (DHP). (3)"

[3] "Yet, the dehydrogenation process suffers from two inherent drawbacks: (i) the endothermicity-induced thermodynamic limit for C3H8 conversion that demands high-energy input and (ii) the rapid catalyst deactivation because of coke formation. (4)"

The growing demand for propylene has led to a serious supply deficit, prompting the development of new production methods beyond traditional steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking. Direct dehydrogenation of propane (DHP) has emerged as an alternative production method. However, DHP faces challenges including high energy requirements due to the endothermic nature of the reaction and rapid catalyst deactivation from coke formation.

The literature does not provide specific information about the evolution of understanding Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts for PDH or debates about active Ga species. There is insufficient information to address this part of the question based on the given text.

丙烯需求的增长导致了严重的供应短缺，促使开发了新的生产方法来补充传统的蒸汽裂解和流化催化裂解。丙烷直接脱氢(DHP)已成为一种替代生产方法。然而，DHP面临一些挑战，包括由于反应的吸热性质而导致的高能耗要求，以及由于焦炭形成而导致的催化剂快速失活。

文献中没有提供关于Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂用于PDH的理解演变或活性Ga物种争论的具体信息。基于给定的文本，没有足够的信息来解答问题的这一部分。
