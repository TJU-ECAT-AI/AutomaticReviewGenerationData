[1] "Refinery propylene is primarily derived from FCC, visbreaking/thermal cracking, and coking. For all of these processes propylene is obtained as a diluted stream in propane. FCC-derived propylene accounts for approximately 30% of the global supply, and this percentage tends to increase as the steam cracking-derived propylene decreases as a result of the growth of ethylene production from ethane-based cracking."

[2] "In recent years, the production of propene via dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) has grown in view of the availability of low-priced propane in shale gas."

The growing demand for propylene has influenced the development of new production methods, particularly propane dehydrogenation (PDH). As traditional sources of propylene like steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) have become insufficient to meet demand, PDH has emerged as an important alternative production method. This growth in PDH has been driven by the increased availability of low-cost propane from shale gas.

The literature does not provide specific information about the evolution of understanding of Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts for PDH, the debate about active Ga species, or recent research findings related to these catalysts. Therefore, this part of the question cannot be answered based on the given text.

丙烯需求的增长推动了新生产方法的发展，特别是丙烷脱氢(PDH)。由于传统的丙烯来源如蒸汽裂解和流化催化裂化(FCC)已不足以满足需求，PDH已成为一种重要的替代生产方法。PDH的增长主要由页岩气中低成本丙烷的增加可用性推动。

文献中没有提供关于Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂在PDH中的理解演变、活性Ga物种的争论，或与这些催化剂相关的最新研究发现的具体信息。因此，基于给定的文本无法回答问题的这一部分。
