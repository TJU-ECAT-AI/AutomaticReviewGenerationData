[1] "Refinery propylene is primarily derived from FCC, visbreaking/thermal cracking, and coking. For all of these processes propylene is obtained as a diluted stream in propane. FCC-derived propylene accounts for approximately 30% of the global supply, and this percentage tends to increase as the steam cracking-derived propylene decreases as a result of the growth of ethylene production from ethane-based cracking."

[2] "In recent years, the production of propene via dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) has grown in view of the availability of low-priced propane in shale gas."

The growing demand for propylene has led to the development of new production methods, particularly propane dehydrogenation (PDH). This shift has been driven by changes in the petrochemical industry, including the decrease in steam cracking-derived propylene due to increased ethane-based cracking for ethylene production. PDH has grown in importance in recent years, largely due to the availability of low-priced propane from shale gas.

The literature does not provide specific information about the evolution of understanding Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts for PDH, the debate about active Ga species, or recent research findings contributing to our current knowledge of these catalysts. Therefore, this part of the question cannot be answered based on the given information.

丙烯需求的增长推动了新生产方法的发展,特别是丙烷脱氢(PDH)。这种转变是由石化行业的变化驱动的,包括由于乙烷基裂解用于乙烯生产的增加而导致的蒸汽裂解衍生丙烯的减少。近年来,PDH的重要性日益增长,主要是由于页岩气中低价丙烷的可用性。

文献中没有提供关于Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂在PDH中的理解演变、活性Ga物种的争论或近期研究发现对这些催化剂当前认知贡献的具体信息。因此,基于给定的信息无法回答问题的这一部分。
