[1] "In recent years, the production of propene via dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) has grown in view of the availability of low-priced propane in shale gas."

[2] "The increased availability of natural gas from shale deposits has produced a major shift in the feedstocks used for the production of ethylene in U.S., and consequently it has affected the propylene and butadiene markets. The use of ethane as feedstock for the crackers instead of naphtha results in a tighter supply of C3 and C4 olefins, and it might increase the prices for those chemicals in the future."

The growing demand for propylene has led to the development of new production methods, particularly propane dehydrogenation (PDH). This shift has been driven by the increased availability of low-priced propane from shale gas. The use of ethane as a feedstock for crackers instead of naphtha has resulted in a tighter supply of C3 and C4 olefins, potentially increasing prices for these chemicals in the future. This situation has created opportunities for alternative processes like PDH to produce propylene.

However, the literature provided does not contain specific information about the evolution of understanding Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts for PDH, the ongoing debate about active Ga species, or recent research findings contributing to our current knowledge of these catalysts. To answer these aspects of the question, additional sources focusing on Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts and PDH technology would be needed.

丙烯需求的增长推动了新生产方法的发展，特别是丙烷脱氢（PDH）。这种转变主要由页岩气中低价丙烷的增加可用性驱动。使用乙烷代替石脑油作为裂解装置的原料导致了C3和C4烯烃供应的紧缩，这可能会在未来推高这些化学品的价格。这种情况为PDH等替代工艺生产丙烯创造了机会。

然而，提供的文献中并不包含关于Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂在PDH中的理解演变、活性Ga物种的持续争论，或最近对这些催化剂的当前认知有贡献的研究发现的具体信息。要回答问题的这些方面，需要额外的关注Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂和PDH技术的资料。
