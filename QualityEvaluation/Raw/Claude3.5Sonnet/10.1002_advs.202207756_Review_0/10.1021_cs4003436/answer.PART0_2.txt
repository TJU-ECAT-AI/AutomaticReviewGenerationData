[1] "Refinery propylene is primarily derived from FCC, visbreaking/thermal cracking, and coking. For all of these processes propylene is obtained as a diluted stream in propane. FCC-derived propylene accounts for approximately 30% of the global supply, and this percentage tends to increase as the steam cracking-derived propylene decreases as a result of the growth of ethylene production from ethane-based cracking."

[2] "In recent years, the production of propene via dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) has grown in view of the availability of low-priced propane in shale gas."

The growing demand for propylene has led to the development of new production methods, particularly propane dehydrogenation (PDH). This shift is driven by changes in feedstock availability, especially the increased availability of low-priced propane from shale gas. PDH has grown in importance as traditional sources of propylene, such as fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) and steam cracking, have become less dominant or shifted towards ethane-based feedstocks. 

However, the literature does not provide specific information about the evolution of understanding regarding Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts for PDH, the ongoing debate about active Ga species, or recent research findings contributing to our current knowledge of these catalysts. The document focuses more broadly on various methods of olefin production and does not delve into the specifics of PDH catalysts.

丙烯需求的增长推动了新生产方法的发展,特别是丙烷脱氢(PDH)。这种转变是由原料供应的变化驱动的,尤其是页岩气中低价丙烷的可用性增加。随着传统丙烯来源(如流化催化裂化(FCC)和蒸汽裂解)变得不那么主导或转向以乙烷为基础的原料,PDH的重要性不断增加。

然而,文献并未提供关于Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂用于PDH的理解演变、活性Ga物种的持续争论,或近期研究发现对这些催化剂当前知识贡献的具体信息。该文档更多地关注烯烃生产的各种方法,而没有深入探讨PDH催化剂的具体情况。
