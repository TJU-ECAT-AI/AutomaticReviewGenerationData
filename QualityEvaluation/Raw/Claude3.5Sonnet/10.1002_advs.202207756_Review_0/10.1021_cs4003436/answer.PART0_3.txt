[1] "Traditionally, propylene is produced as a byproduct of steam cracking of naphtha for ethylene production or it is recovered from refinery processes, especially from fluid catalytic cracking (FCC)."

[2] "In recent years, the production of propene via dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) has grown in view of the availability of low-priced propane in shale gas."

The growing demand for propylene has led to the development of new production methods, particularly propane dehydrogenation (PDH). This process has gained importance in recent years due to the availability of low-cost propane from shale gas. While traditionally propylene was produced as a byproduct of naphtha cracking or recovered from refinery processes like fluid catalytic cracking (FCC), PDH has emerged as a dedicated method to meet the increasing propylene demand.

The literature does not provide specific information about the evolution of understanding Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts for PDH, the debate about active Ga species, or recent research findings contributing to our current knowledge of these catalysts. Therefore, this part of the question cannot be answered based on the given information.

丙烯需求的增长推动了新生产方法的发展，特别是丙烷脱氢(PDH)。近年来，由于页岩气中低价丙烷的可用性，这一工艺变得越来越重要。传统上，丙烯是作为石脑油裂解的副产品生产的，或从炼油厂工艺(如流化催化裂化FCC)中回收，而PDH已经成为满足不断增长的丙烯需求的专门方法。

文献中没有提供关于Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂用于PDH的理解演变、活性Ga物种的争论，或近期研究发现对这些催化剂的当前知识贡献的具体信息。因此，基于给定信息无法回答问题的这一部分。
