<EnglishVersionAnswer>

The given literature does not contain information about the growing demand for propylene, new production methods like propane dehydrogenation (PDH), or the development of Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts for PDH. The document focuses on CO2 reduction reactions with propane, including dry reforming of propane (DRP) and CO2-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (CO2-ODHP). It does not discuss traditional propane dehydrogenation or Ga-based catalysts.
