          [1] "Propylene is an essential industrial intermediate with a gap between supply and anticipated demand (12)."

          [2] "Nonoxidative propane dehydrogenation (PDH) is endothermic and equilibrium-limited, necessitating high temperatures to achieve commercially viable per-pass yields (13)."

          [3] "Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) has been proposed to overcome equilibrium limitations and avoid thermal cracking but suffers from decreasing selectivity with increasing conversion, giving yields below the PDH equilibrium, in spite of decades of research (12, 14)."

          The growing demand for propylene has led to the development of new production methods, particularly propane dehydrogenation (PDH). There is a gap between the supply and anticipated demand for propylene, which has driven research into more efficient production processes. PDH has emerged as a potential solution, but it faces challenges due to its endothermic nature and equilibrium limitations, requiring high temperatures to achieve commercially viable yields.

          To address these issues, oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) has been proposed as an alternative method. ODHP aims to overcome the equilibrium limitations of PDH and avoid thermal cracking. However, it struggles with decreasing selectivity as conversion increases, resulting in yields below the PDH equilibrium despite decades of research.

          The provided information does not specifically mention Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts for PDH or discuss the debate about active Ga species. Therefore, the evolution of understanding regarding these catalysts and recent research findings related to them cannot be addressed based on the given literature.

          丙烯需求的增长推动了新生产方法的发展，特别是丙烷脱氢（PDH）。丙烯的供应和预期需求之间存在差距，这促使研究人员开发更高效的生产工艺。PDH作为一种潜在解决方案出现，但由于其吸热性质和平衡限制，面临着挑战，需要高温才能实现商业可行的产率。

          为解决这些问题，提出了丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）作为替代方法。ODHP旨在克服PDH的平衡限制并避免热裂解。然而，它面临着随着转化率增加而选择性降低的问题，导致产率低于PDH平衡，尽管已经经过数十年的研究。

          所提供的信息没有特别提到用于PDH的Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂，也没有讨论活性Ga物种的争论。因此，基于给定的文献，无法讨论这些催化剂的理解演变或与之相关的最新研究发现。
