The growing demand for propylene has led to the development of new production methods, particularly propane dehydrogenation (PDH). There is a gap between the supply and anticipated demand for propylene, which has driven research into more efficient production processes. Traditional nonoxidative PDH is limited by thermodynamic equilibrium and requires high temperatures for commercially viable yields. Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) has been proposed as an alternative to overcome these limitations, but it faces challenges with decreasing selectivity at higher conversions.

The literature does not provide specific information about Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts for PDH or the debate about active Ga species. The focus of the given text is on a different catalyst system involving Pt/Al2O3 and In2O3. Therefore, the question about the evolution of understanding Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts cannot be answered based on the provided information.

丙烯需求的增长推动了新生产方法的发展，特别是丙烷脱氢(PDH)。丙烯的供应和预期需求之间存在差距，这推动了对更高效生产工艺的研究。传统的非氧化PDH受到热力学平衡的限制，需要高温才能获得商业上可行的产率。提出了丙烷的氧化脱氢(ODHP)作为克服这些限制的替代方法，但在高转化率下面临选择性降低的挑战。

文献没有提供关于Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂用于PDH或活性Ga物种争论的具体信息。给定文本的重点是涉及Pt/Al2O3和In2O3的不同催化剂系统。因此，基于所提供的信息无法回答关于理解Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂演变的问题。
