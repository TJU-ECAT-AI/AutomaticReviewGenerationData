The growing demand for propylene has led to the development of new production methods, particularly propane dehydrogenation (PDH). There is a gap between the supply and anticipated demand for propylene, which has driven research into more efficient production processes. PDH has emerged as a potential solution, but it faces challenges due to its endothermic nature and equilibrium limitations, requiring high temperatures to achieve commercially viable yields.

Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) has been proposed as an alternative to overcome the limitations of PDH and avoid thermal cracking. However, ODHP has its own challenges, particularly decreasing selectivity with increasing conversion, resulting in yields below the PDH equilibrium despite decades of research.

The literature does not provide specific information about Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts for PDH or the debate about active Ga species. Therefore, the evolution of understanding these catalysts and recent research findings cannot be addressed based on the given text.

丙烯需求的增长推动了新生产方法的开发，特别是丙烷脱氢(PDH)。丙烯的供应和预期需求之间存在差距，这促使研究人员开发更高效的生产工艺。PDH作为一种潜在的解决方案出现，但由于其吸热性和平衡限制，面临挑战，需要高温才能达到商业可行的产率。

氧化脱氢丙烷(ODHP)被提出作为克服PDH局限性并避免热裂解的替代方案。然而，ODHP也面临自身的挑战，特别是随着转化率的增加选择性降低，导致产率低于PDH平衡，尽管经过数十年的研究。

文献中没有提供关于Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂用于PDH的具体信息，也没有提到活性Ga物种的争论。因此，基于给定的文本无法讨论对这些催化剂的理解演变和最近的研究发现。
