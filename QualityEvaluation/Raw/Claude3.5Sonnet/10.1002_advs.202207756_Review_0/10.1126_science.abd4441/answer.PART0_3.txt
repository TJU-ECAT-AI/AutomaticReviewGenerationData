The growing demand for propylene has led to the development of new production methods, particularly propane dehydrogenation (PDH). There is a gap between the supply and anticipated demand for propylene, which has driven research into more efficient production processes. 

Nonoxidative PDH has been a focus, but it faces challenges due to being endothermic and equilibrium-limited, requiring high temperatures for commercially viable yields. To address these limitations, oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) has been proposed as an alternative method to overcome equilibrium limitations and avoid thermal cracking.

However, the literature does not provide specific information about Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts for PDH, their active Ga species, or recent research findings related to these catalysts. The focus of the given text is on a different catalyst system involving Pt, Al2O3, and In2O3 for tandem catalysis in propane dehydrogenation coupled with selective hydrogen combustion.

丙烯需求的增长推动了新生产方法的发展，特别是丙烷脱氢(PDH)。丙烯的供应和预期需求之间存在差距，这促使研究人员开发更高效的生产工艺。

非氧化PDH一直是研究重点，但由于其吸热性和平衡限制，面临着挑战，需要高温才能获得商业上可行的产率。为了解决这些限制，提出了丙烷氧化脱氢(ODHP)作为一种替代方法，以克服平衡限制并避免热裂解。

然而，文献中并未提供关于Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂用于PDH的具体信息，其活性Ga物种，或与这些催化剂相关的最新研究发现。给定文本的重点是一种不同的催化剂系统，涉及Pt、Al2O3和In2O3用于丙烷脱氢与选择性氢气燃烧的串联催化。
