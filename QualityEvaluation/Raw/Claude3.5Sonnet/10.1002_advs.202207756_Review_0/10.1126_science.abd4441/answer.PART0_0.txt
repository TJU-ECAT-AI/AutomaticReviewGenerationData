The growing demand for propylene has led to the development of new production methods, particularly propane dehydrogenation (PDH). The literature mentions that there is a gap between the supply and anticipated demand for propylene, which has driven research into more efficient production methods. 

PDH has been explored as a production method, but it faces challenges due to being endothermic and equilibrium-limited. This necessitates high temperatures to achieve commercially viable yields. To overcome these limitations, oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) has been proposed. ODHP aims to overcome equilibrium limitations and avoid thermal cracking. However, it suffers from decreasing selectivity with increasing conversion, resulting in yields below the PDH equilibrium despite decades of research.

The literature does not provide specific information about Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts for PDH or the debate about active Ga species. Therefore, I cannot provide information on how the understanding of these catalysts has evolved or recent research findings related to them based on the given text.

丙烯需求的增长推动了新生产方法的发展，特别是丙烷脱氢（PDH）。文献提到丙烯的供应和预期需求之间存在差距，这推动了对更高效生产方法的研究。

PDH作为一种生产方法被探索，但由于其吸热和平衡受限的特性而面临挑战。这需要高温才能达到商业可行的产率。为了克服这些限制，提出了丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）。ODHP旨在克服平衡限制并避免热裂解。然而，它随着转化率的增加而选择性降低，导致产率低于PDH平衡，尽管已经研究了数十年。

文献没有提供关于Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂用于PDH的具体信息，也没有提到关于活性Ga物种的争论。因此，基于给定的文本，我无法提供关于这些催化剂理解如何演变或最近研究发现的信息。
