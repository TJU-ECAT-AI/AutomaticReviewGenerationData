Three series of gallium-containing MFI zeolite were prepared with different gallium content by weight,
by hydrothermal synthesis [Ga]-MFI (0.24.7 wt% Ga), ion exchange Ga/P (0.56.8 wt% Ga) and mechan-
ical mixture Ga+P (0.510 wt% Ga). Under hydrogen at 600 C on the aluminosilicate doped with gallium,
a reducing solid ionic exchange occurs between a mobile species (Ga2O) and the protonic sites of the zeo-
lite. The proportion of Ga implied in this exchange depends on both the proximity between Ga2O3 and the
zeolite and the initial gallium content. The solid reductive exchange remains limited, ranging from 25% to
only a few percent; therefore the gallium species content located in the zeolite micropores is only 0.2
0.4 wt%. The aluminosilicates doped with Ga are more active in both cyclohexane dehydrogenation
and propane aromatization than the gallosilicates: the gallium in the framework is much less active than
gallium in the exchange position.

1. Introduction
The propane aromatization process, developed 40 years ago,
runs with a bifunctional catalyst based on gallium and MFI zeolite
[1]. Ga-MFI catalyst can be synthetized in several manners: wet-
ness impregnation (Ga-HZSM-5) [24], ion exchange (Ga/HZSM-
5) [58], mechanical mixture of Ga2O3 and protonated MFI-type
zeolite (Ga+HZSM-5) [9,10], hydrothermal synthesis ([Ga]-MFI)
[1113], etc. These different preparation methods impact the ini-
tial location of Ga: in hydrothermal synthesis, gallium cations are
part of the zeolite framework; in the ionic exchange and impregna-
tion methods, the pore size diameter of the MFI zeolite does not
allow the hydrated Ga3+ ion to enter the micropores and therefore
the Ga species are deposited on the external surface of the zeolite
crystal [14]; in the mechanical mixture procedure, Ga2O3 is totally
separated from the zeolite. Regardless of the method used, the oxi-
dation state of gallium is always +3.
Surprisingly, the catalytic performance of Ga/HZSM-5 catalysts
is similar to that of Ga+ZSM-5 catalysts [15] and slightly higher
than that of [Ga]-MFI catalysts [16,17]. The catalytic performance
(activity, selectivity, and stability) is slightly influenced by the
mode of preparation used, as the real bifunctional catalyst is pre-
pared in situ during the pretreatment under hydrogen [18,19]. The
catalyst reduction at high temperature causes drastic modifica-
tions in both the location and oxidation state (from +3 to +1) of gal-
lium. Indeed, reductive solid ionic exchange (RSIE) occurs between
the zeolite protonic site and the gallium suboxide species (Ga2O)
[3,18,20,21] that come from the reduction of gallium oxide; RSIE
leads to the formation of mono- and dihydride gallium species,
GaH2+, GaH2
+ or Ga+, where their proportion evidently depends on
the Ga and Al content [3,21].
This study focuses on the influence of the content and location
of gallium in the MFI zeolite (in, on, or outside), on the efficiency of
the reductive solid ionic exchange, and therefore on the catalytic
performance of such bifunctional catalysts. RSIE will be character-
ized before and during the reduction treatment using in -situ tech-
niques such as TPR, XPS, and FTIR. The catalyst efficiency was
evaluated by cyclohexane transformation and propane aromatiza-
tion. Cyclohexane dehydrogenation will allow characterization of
the dehydrogenating function of the gallium-based catalysts. Par-
ticular attention was given to on the nature and toxicity of coke.

2. Experimental
2.1. Preparation of catalysts
A protonated ZSM-5 zeolite (P) with a Si/Al molar ratio of 40
was obtained from the calcination of a NH4-ZSM-5 zeolite (Zeolyst)
in a muffle furnace at 773 K (5 K min1) for 12 h.
Three series of bifunctional catalysts were prepared. The first,
denoted (Ga + P), was prepared by intimate mechanical mixture
of P and b-Ga2O3 powders (purity 99.99%; Alfa Aesar). They were
mixed and milled several times in a mortar to ensure a homoge-
neous distribution of the particles. The second series, named (Ga/
P), was prepared by ionic exchange carried out for 3 h at 373 K
using Ga(NO3)3 (purity 99.90%; Sigma Aldrich); the volume of the
exchange solution per gram of zeolite was 100 mL. The exchanged
zeolite was calcined under air for 12 h (5 K min1) at 773 K. The
third series ([Ga]-MFI) was MFI-type gallosilicates synthetized in
a fluoride medium according to Ref. [22]. Aerosil 130 was used
as the silicon source and gallium nitrate as the gallium source. In
a typical synthesis of gallosilicate ZSM-5 zeolite, the different
ingredients were mixed to obtain the following molar gel compo-
sition: 1SiO2; xGa2O3; 0.25TPABr; 0.5NH4F; yH2O, where x is the
Ga2O3/SiO2 molar ratio (with x = 0.0025, 0.005, 0.01, 0.025, and
0.05) and y is the molar ratio of water (with y = 30, 40, or 50) in
the starting gel. The resultant gel mixture was blended using a
magnetic stirrer. The final gel was transferred to a Teflon-lined
stainless steel autoclave and heated at 473 K for z days (z = 5, 15,
17, 27, or 34 days). After crystallization, the product was filtered,
washed with distilled water, and dried at 373 K. The products were
calcined at 773 K for 4 h under air in order to remove the organic
templates. Table 1 summarizes the molar composition of the start-
ing gels and the hydrothermal conditions for the preparation of
[Ga]-MFI materials. The Ga content in the three catalysts series
ranged between 0.2 and 4.7 wt%.
2.2. Characterization of catalysts
2.2.1. Calcined and reduced catalyst characterization
The elemental composition of the bifunctional catalysts (Si, Al,
Ga) was determined using inductively coupled plasma-atomic
emission spectroscopy on an Optima 2000 DV (Perkin-Elmer).
The samples (3040 mg) were dissolved in a mixture of HNO3
(> 68 vol%), HCl (3437 vol%), and HF (4751 vol%) in the propor-
tion 4/2/2 mL, respectively. The mineralization was carried out in
sealed vessels at 453 K under an autogenous pressure of 2.0 MPa
for 45 min using a microwave oven (Anton-Parr Multiwave Pro).
The morphology and size of the solid were determined using a
FEG-SEMJEOL microscope (JSM 5600-LV model). The distribution
of gallium and silicon within the [Ga]-MFI crystals was mapped
using a JEOL 2100 LaB6 equipped with an EDX detector JED Analy-
sis Program. Samples were also characterized by transmission elec-
tron microscopy (TEM) using a Philips CM 120 microscope
equipped with a LaB6 filament.
The textural properties were determined by N2 sorption mea-
surements at 77 K using a Micromeritics ASAP 2000 gas adsorption
analyzer. Prior to measurements, the fresh and spent samples were
outgassed for 4 h at 623 K and 1 h at 423 K, respectively.
The FT-IR measurements were carried out in a Nicolet 750
Magna FTIR 550 spectrometer (resolution 2 cm1). Samples were
pressed into thin wafers (20 mg) and activated in situ in the IR
cell under secondary vacuum (106 mbar) at 623 K. Prior to mea-
surements, the samples were treated overnight either in air (100
mL min1) at 723 K (ramp: 2 K min1) or under hydrogen (100
mL min1) at 873 K. The spent samples were outgassed under pri-
mary vacuum (103 mbar) at 423 K for 1 h. Adsorption of pyridine
at 423 K probed the Brnsted and Lewis acid sites, and their con-
centrations were calculated by integrating the band areas at
1545 and 1454 cm1 using the extinction coefficients 1.13 and
1.28 cm mol1, respectively [23].
The temperature-programmed reduction (TPR) measurements
were carried out using a Quantachrome Autosorb 1-C analyzer.
The catalyst (200 mg) was pretreated in situ at 373 K (5 K min1)
for 1 h under helium (He) flow (30 mL min1). After the sample
cooled to room temperature under He, the reduction was carried
out at up to 1273 K under H2 (1 vol%) diluted in argon (Ar) with
a flow rate of 30 mL min1 and a heating rate of 5 K min1.
The XPS analyses were carried out on a Kratos Axis Ultra DLD
spectrometer using a monochromatic AlKa source (10 mA, 15 kV)
and the instrument base pressure was 9  108 Pa. The charge neu-
tralizer system was operated for all analyses. High-resolution spec-
tra were recorded using analysis area 300  700 m and pass
energy 40 eV. These pass energies correspond to Ag3d5/2 FWHM
of 0.55 eV. Data were acquired with 0.1 eV steps. The binding
energy was calibrated using Si2p binding energy fixed at 103.8 eV.
Samples pressed into thin wafers ( 20 mg) were placed in a
catalyst cell coupled to the spectrometer and were calcined or
reduced in situ. Spectral processings were analyzed with CasaXPS
software (version 2.3.17 dev6.3a) and peak fittings were performed
with GaussianLorentzian profiles. For the quantitative analysis,
the following binding energies regions were recorded: C1s, O1s,
Ga2p3/2, Ga3d5/2 + O2s, and Ga LMM.
2.2.2. Spent catalyst characterization
The coke content was measured with a SDT Q600 T thermo-
gravimetric analyzer under a 100 mL min1 flow of air at up to
1173 K. The carbon content was measured using full burning at
1293 K with a mixture of helium and oxygen in a Thermoquest
NA2100 analyzer.
To release the molecules trapped in the zeolite pores, the spent
catalysts were dissolved in a 51 vol% hydrofluoric acid solution at
room temperature during 20 min. HF was neutralized by a boric
acid solution and sodium hydrogen carbonate. The residue was
extracted with CH2Cl2. A sample of 10 mg of the extract was sus-
pended in 500 L of THF and was mixed with dithranol as a MALDI
matrix (6 g/L in THF). After sonication, about 0.5 L of this mixture
was hand-spotted onto the stainless steel target and dried at room

temperature. Analyses were achieved on a Brker Autoflex Speed
mass spectrometer in a reflectron positive mode, where ions were
generated by a 337 nm wavelength nitrogen laser using pulsed ion
extraction (delay time 130 ns). The laser power was adjusted
slightly above the threshold of desorption/ionization process and
the spectra were the sum of 40,000 shots.
2.3. Catalytic test
Before the catalytic test, the catalysts were compacted, crushed,
and sieved to obtain homogeneous particles (0.20.4 mm).
Cyclohexane transformation: The catalysts (100 mg) were pre-
treated in a quartz tube under hydrogen flow (90 mL min1) at
873 K for 10 h. The cyclohexane transformation was performed at
atmospheric pressure in a downflow fixed-bed reactor at 723 K,
with a H2/cyclohexane molar ratio of 16 at a contact time
(1/WHSV) of 0.002 min. The products were analyzed online with
a gas chromatograph (Varian 3400 X) equipped with a flame ion-
ization detector connected to the capillary column (PLOT/Al2O3,
50 m, di = 530 m).
Propane aromatization: This was carried out using a continuous-
flow reaction apparatus. Before testing, the catalysts (300 mg)
were pretreated at 873 K under hydrogen flow (60 mL min1) for
10 h. The reaction was performed at 803 K with propane (purity
100%, Air Liquide) at atmospheric pressure and for a contact time
of 0.03 min. The products were analyzed online using a gas chro-
matograph (7890A Agilent) equipped with a TCD connected to a
mole sieve column (13 X, 1.5 m, di = 0.2 mm) and a FID linked to
a capillary column (CP-Sil PONA CB, 100 m, di = 250 m).
3. Results
Three series of bifunctional catalysts were prepared with differ-
ent degrees of proximity between the Ga species and protonic
sites: (i) distant on Ga + P series (mechanical mixture of oxide
powders, MM), (ii) closer in the Ga/P series (ionic exchange, IE),
and (iii) even closer in [Ga]-MFI series (hydrothermal synthesis
of MFI- type gallosilicates). On aluminosilicate, the gallium content
ranges from 0.5 to 6.8 wt%, which corresponds to Ga/Al molar
ratios from 0.2 to 2.4 (Table 2). Therefore, the maximum exchange
capacity, assuming a stoichiometry of (1:1), is ca. 2.5 wt%.
3.1. Characterization of fresh and reduced catalyst
Fig. 1 shows the SEM and TEM images of the parent zeolite (P)
after calcination and compares the TEM images of the 1%Ga + P and
0.9%Ga/P obtained after calcination and reduction treatments. The
commercial aluminosilicate MFI-type zeolite displays spherical
crystals with an average diameter of 0.5 m (Fig. 1a and d). The
TEM image of the calcined 1%Ga + P (Fig. 1b) shows, as expected,
two separated materials: Ga2O3 (dark gray) and the MFI zeolite
(light gray). The preparation by cationic exchange also leads after
calcination to a mixture of two oxides, but in this case the shape
of gallium oxide is different, showing needles, which seem to be
rooted from the surface of the zeolite crystal (Fig. 1c). After reduc-
tion of the calcined catalysts, the crystals of gallium oxide (what-
ever their initial shapes) disappear (Fig. 1e and 1f), while spheres
appears on the surface of the zeolite crystal, which are probably
nanoparticles of gallium oxides with diameters of 510 nm on
Ga/P and Ga + P, respectively (Fig. 1e and 1f). These changes indi-
cate that the gallium species migrate during the reduction treat-
ment. The SEM images of the synthesized gallosilicates in Fig. 2
show large crystals ( =10 m) with intergrowths on the different
parts of the prism. EDX mapping (Fig. 2) shows that for lower con-
tent of Ga in the zeolite framework, coreshell particles are
observed. These coreshell particles seem to be constituted of a
pure silica shell, with the Ga species essentially in the core of the
particle. For a larger amount of Ga in the zeolite framework, a
homogeneous distribution of the Si and Ga species is observed in
the particles.
On the 2.2% [Ga]-MFI gallosilicate, the Si/Ga molar ratio mea-
sured by both RF and XPS are identical, i.e., 50, indicating a homo-
geneous distribution of Ga in the crystal. The binding energy (BE)
Ga2p3/2 signal value (BE = 1118.6 eV) indicates an oxidation state
of +3 (Fig. SI.1 in the Supporting information). For this sample,
the Si and Ga X-ray mappings (Fig. 2) confirm the homogeneous
distribution of these elements through the crystal. A similar result
is observed for the 4.7% [Ga]-MFI sample. As expected from Ref.
[22], with the decrease of metal content, the distribution becomes
more heterogeneous; the gallium distribution shows a coreshell
type with the core poor in Ga (Fig. 2, Si/Ga = 125).

the online version, at https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcat.2018.06.029.
The textural and acidic properties of the calcined samples are
reported in Table 2. (P), Ga/P, and [Ga]-MFI series have micropore
volumes (Vmicro) corresponding to the one expected for conven-
tional MFI-type zeolite, i.e., 0.170.18 cm3 g1 [24,25]. Further-
more, similar Vmicro between the parent and the exchanged
zeolite means that the gallium species do not obstruct the pores.
They are located mainly on the external surface (Sext). The differ-
ence in Sext between the gallosilicates ([Ga]-MFI) and the parent
zeolite loaded with gallium (Ga/P) is related to the crystal size:

the larger the crystal size, the smaller is the external surface, and
when the crystal size is higher to several micrometers (as in the
case of the [Ga]-MFI series), Sext becomes limited to a few m2 g1.
The FTIR spectra in the OH stretching region of the three cal-
cined catalyst series are depicted in Fig. 3. The five main bands
on Ga + P and Ga/P catalysts are assigned to silanol nests (broad
band ranging from 3550 to 3300 cm1), bridged hydroxyl groups
(Si(OH)Al, 3611 cm1), extra-framework aluminum species (3674
cm1), and external and internal silanols (3742 and 3738 cm1).
The ionic exchange causes a slight decrease both of internal silanol
and of silanol nest bands, indicating a weak incorporation of gal-
lium cations into the zeolite framework. Si(OH)Al and Si(OH)Ga
give similar IR bands. The absence of silanol nest bands on the
[Ga]-MFI implies that it can be considered as a pristine material;
the low intensity of external silanol is in agreement with its large
crystal size.

The Brnsted and Lewis acid sites are quantified using the IR
bands appearing at 1545 cm1 (PyH+) and 1454 cm1 (PyL) after
pyridine adsorption at 423 K (Table 2). On the P sample, the con-
centration of Brnsted acid site (BAS) able to retain pyridine at
423 K is 300 mol g1, which corresponds to 75% of the theoretical
acidity (407 molg1). The concentration of BAS stays stable what-
ever the gallium concentration on IE catalyst series (Fig. 4), this
confirms that Ga species are mainly located after calcination on
the external surface as Ga2O3 (Table 2, Fig. 3). New Lewis acid sites
(LAS) are created only on the IE series, approximately 3050 lmol
g1. Unlike bulk Ga2O3 in the MM series (Fig. 1b), the needles of
gallium oxide in intimacy with the zeolite (Fig. 1c) generate new
acidic sites that can coordinate pyridine. The concentration of
Brnsted acid sites on gallosilicate is slightly higher (363 molg1)
than the one observed for Ga + P or Ga/P catalysts, although the
number of Ga atoms is two times higher (Si/Ga = 23) than that of
Al atoms (Si/Al = 40).
Regardless of the preparation method (MM or IE), the bands of
bridged Si(OH)Al and silanol nest vanish almost totally after reduc-
tion at 873 K (Fig. 3). The disappearance of the last band is only due
to a thermal effect (dehydroxylation) because the oxidation treat-
ment carried out at the same temperature also leads to the
disappearance of the silanol nests (Fig. SI.2). The strong decrease
of the bridged OH groups is related to their interaction with gal-
lium cation during the reductive treatment. The gallium suboxide
(Ga2O) resulting from the reduction of gallium oxide (Ga2O3)
migrates inside the zeolite micropores to substitute a proton
[26,27], and interacts with Brnsted acid sites:
Ga2O3+2H2!Ga2O+2H2O.

Whatever the method of preparation of the bifunctional cata-
lysts (MM or IE), the acidic properties (nature and concentration
of acid sites) are strongly modified during the hydrogen treatment
at high temperature (873 K). The changes are more important on
Ga/P than on Ga + P series. The reduction leads to the appearance
of new sites able to coordinate with pyridine (PyL) concomitant
with the disappearance of Brnsted acid sites (PyH+) (Fig. 4). In a
recent paper, Schreiber et al. [28] found Ga/MFI catalyst prepared
by incipient wetness (IW) leads, after in situ reduction, to form
of two types of Lewis acid sites with bands at 1457 cm1 and
1446 cm1; assigned to coordinatively absorbed pyridine on Ga+
in a homotopic site and GaxOy species, respectively. The concentra-
tion of Ga+ increases with the Ga loading while GaxOy clusters
appear from samples with Ga/Al ratio > 0.5. In the case of IE and

MM series, the deconvolution (using Gaussian functions) of the
band of LAS gives two bands centered at 1457  2 and 1447  2
cm1 (Fig. SI.3). In contrast to the results of [28], the band at
1447 cm1 remains almost constant and low (Fig. SI.4, Table SI.1)
whatever the Ga loading. The intensity of the band at 1455 cm1
on the parent zeolite increases with the gallium content and shifts
to a higher wavenumber identical to that found on the gallosilicate
(Fig. SI.4). This shift, albeit small (+4 cm1), is significate; the FT IR
resolution being lower than 2 cm1). The higher wavenumber of
the LAS on bifunctional catalysts points to a site that acts as
slightly stronger LAS toward pyridine.
It is worth noting that the total disappearance of the bridging
OH (Fig. 3) does not imply that of Brnsted acid sites; they
decrease partially and not totally (Table 3). On the two catalyst ser-
ies, the concentrations of created Lewis acid sites (LAS) are propor-
tional to the concentration of gallium, which is higher on IE than
on MM series (Fig. 4). Regardless of the catalyst preparation, the
number of created LAS is almost three times the number of con-
sumed BAS (Fig. SI.5). On P and IE series, an ionic exchange
between the gallium cation and protonic sites occurs during the
reduction with a stoichiometry close to 3. This result is different
from that found by Schreiber et al. [28]; they conclude from pyri-
dine adsorption data that for catalysts with Ga/Al  1 the exchange
of the protons of SiOHAl groups with gallium species occurs with a
stoichiometry of Ga/H+ = 1:1. The maximum exchange capacity
(taking account only of the BAS able to retain pyridine at 423 K)
with a stoichiometry Ga:H+ = 3:1 cannot exceed 0.72 wt%. This
means that a limited proportion of gallium species (Gaex) migrate
and react with BAS: less than 4% on the MM series, and on the IE
series, the proportion of reactive Ga, which is higher, tends to
increase with the decrease in metal content, reaching up to one-
fourth on 0.9 Ga/P catalyst (Table 3). In other words, the gallium
content that reacted with the BAS (Gaz) in Ga/P and Ga + P series
ranges from 0.05 to 0.4 wt% (Table 3 and Fig. SI.5). The remaining
Ga is located on located on the zeolite external surface as nanoclus-
ters of gallium oxide (Fig. 1e and f).
Fig. 5 compares the temperature-programed reduction (H2 TPR)
profiles of MM and IE catalyst series. It is worth noting that using a
low heating rate (b = 5 C min1) yields both higher reduction tem-
peratures than those reported in the literature and widening of the
peaks. No reduction occurs on Ga2O3, but when the oxide is com-
bined with a protonic zeolite, this becomes possible. The TPR dis-
plays two peaks centered at 880900 and at 1150 K. Compared
with the Ga + P sample, the sample prepared by ionic exchange is
reduced at a lower temperature. The first peak is attributed to
the reduction of Ga2O3 to Ga2O (Eq. (1)) [18] . The assignment of
the second peak is more complicated, and depends even more on
the method of catalyst preparation: with MM series [18] it is
assigned to the reduction of Ga2O3 weakly linked to the zeolite
and with IE series to the reduction of gallyl ions (GaO+) in extra-
framework position to Ga+ [29]. The TPR numerical data reported
in Table 3 reveal that when all the introduced gallium is consid-
ered, the molar ratio H2/Ga is less than 1, but as shown previously,
only a small portion of the Ga has migrated and reacts with BAS.

Taking into account the number of gallium exchanged (Gaz), the
H2/Ga becomes very high, especially on the MM series (13.5). On
the IE series, the H2/Ga ratio passes through a maximum of 12.9
with a Ga content of 2.5 wt%. Moreover, Schreiber et al. [28], by
combining the specific consumption of H2 and its ratio to the con-
centration of H2O formed (via a pulse technique), conclude that the
reduction of gallium oxide at 873 K yields to the formation of Ga+;
as for species [GaOH], [GaH2]+, and [GaO]+, they are not formed.
Fig. 6 compares for 4.5%Ga/P and 5%Ga + P catalysts the Si/Ga
molar ratio of the surface measured by XPS as a function of the
oxidative and reductive treatment time, and Fig. 7 shows their
Ga2p3/2 and Ga3d5/2 + O2s XPS spectra. On the catalyst prepared
from mixture of oxides, 5%Ga + P, after calcination treatment at
723 K (red line in Fig. 6), the Si/Ga ratio is ca. 20 and the oxidation
state of surface gallium is +3. The binding energy (BE) Ga2p3/2 and

respectively (Fig. 7), very close to the reference data in [30,31].
After reduction (blue line in Fig. 6) for 1 h at 873 K, the Si/Ga molar
ratio increases slightly to 25, suggesting a depletion of gallium
oxide on the zeolite external surface, and when the time of reduc-
tion is extended to 3 h, the Si/Ga ratio continues to increase to 35
(Fig. 6). The large decrease of the Ga2p2/3 and Ga3d5/2 intensity
after 3 h of reduction is attributed to the diffusion of the gallium
species within the zeolite micropores (Fig. 7). After calcination
treatment, the band is symmetric and centered at 1118.9 eV
whereas after reduction treatment, it shifts to higher BE (1119.6
eV) and becomes asymmetric. The deconvolution gives two peaks
centered at 1119.7 and 1118.4 eV. The positive shift could be
attributed to a change in both the size and location of Ga2O3 during
the reduction (Fig. 1). On the calcined samples (5%Ga + P and 4.5%
Ga/P), the gallium oxide crystals are bulky and separated from the
zeolite, whereas after the reduction, a strong intimacy appears
between Ga2O3 and zeolite (nanocrystals of gallium oxide dis-
persed on the surface of zeolite crystal). A close proximity to the
zeolite can decrease the electron density on the gallium atom
and cause a positive shift of the binding energy [32]. In addition,
in the Ga3d5/2 + O2s spectra, after the reduction treatment the peak
at 21.0 eV shifts to a higher binding energy (21.7 eV), and a small
band appears at 18.4 eV; this peak can be assigned to the reduced
gallium species. Fig. 8 displays the Auger spectra of the mechanical
mixture as a function of reduction time. The reduction of the
calcined sample yields simultaneously a decrease of the peak at
424.2 eV and the appearance of a new one at 427.1 eV.
On the catalyst prepared by ionic exchange (4.5%Ga/P) after cal-
cination, the Si/Ga molar ratio is 19.2 and after reduction becomes
42.7 (Fig. 6). As observed previously in the mechanical mixtures,
the reduction leads to a decrease in the intensities of Ga2p3/2 and
Ga3d5/2 + O2s signal spectra (Fig. 7), owing to the migration of gal-
lium species into the zeolite crystal. On the catalyst prepared by
ionic exchange, the migration of gallium species is faster than on
this prepared by mixing of powders; this result is in agreement
with our TPR results. In the Ga2p3/2 spectra of 4.5%Ga/P (Fig. 7),
the peak shifts to a higher BE, from 1119.0 to 1119.6 eV, and the
deconvolution of the latter peak gives two peaks at 1119.8 and
1118.6 eV, which can be attributed to the same species already
cited.
3.2. Catalytic test
3.2.1. Transformation of cyclohexane
Cyclohexane (C6,cycle) is an intermediate of the propane aroma-
tization, but it is not observed among the products owing to its
high reactivity. Nevertheless, cyclohexane dehydrogenation can
be useful to characterize the dehydrogenating function of the
gallium-based catalysts. The C6,cycle transformation is carried out
at the same reaction temperature as propane aromatization, 803
K. The main products are benzene, toluene, and xylene (dehydro-
genation products) and light olefins and paraffins (cracking
products). The presence of toluene and xylene indicates that alky-
lation reactions occur between the benzene and light olefins. Fig. 9
displays the product yields as a function of the gallium content.
Neither the zeolite nor the gallium oxide can easily dehydrogenate
cyclohexane, but their combination allows it (Fig. 9a). On alumi-
nosilicate catalysts, the synergistic effect is independent of the cat-
alyst preparation (MM or IE) and it is optimal with an Al/Ga molar
ratio of 0.4 (i.e., a Ga content of 2.5 wt%). The cyclohexane dehy-
drogenation requires two functions, in other words a bi-site.
Fig. 9b shows the yield of cracking products as a function of gal-
lium content. The cracking requires strong Brnsted acid sites;
hence it seems maximum on the P zeolite and zero on Ga2O3.The
cracking yield decreases with the increase of gallium content
owing to partial neutralization of the Brnsted acid sites (Table 3),
which is greater on the MM series than on the IE series (Fig. 4). The
acid sites on the [Ga]-MFI series seem not strong enough to be able
to crack the cyclohexane, making this catalyst extremely selective
for benzene. On IE and MM catalyst series, the presence of light
olefins leads to side reactions such as alkylations, which result in
the formation of toluene and xylene.

3.2.2. Propane aromatization
Propane aromatization is carried out at 803 K at atmospheric
pressure. Fig. 10 compares the propane conversion as a function
of time on stream on Ga2O3, P zeolite, MM, IE, and gallosilicate
bifunctional catalysts. The activity and stability ranks as follows:
Ga2O3 < P < [Ga]-MFI < Ga + P  Ga/P. After 1 h, the deactivation
rate ranges from 10 up to 30%. The combination of gallium with
the ZSM-5 zeolite enhances both the activity and the stability.
The main desorbed products of the propane aromatization are
methane, paraffins (P27), olefins (O28), aromatics (A69), and
hydrogen. No traces of cycloalkanes were detected, showing the
high reactivity of these molecules. The product yields are shown
in Fig. 11A as a function of conversion. Regardless of the catalyst
series, methane from protolytic cracking and H2 from the dehydro-
genation reaction appear as primary products (Fig. 11Aa,b).
Since CH4 is inert in our operating conditions, its yield increases
continuously with the conversion (Fig. 11Ab). Olefins are also pri-
mary products (Fig. 11Ad), and their high reactivity leads rapidly to
secondary reactions such as the di-trimerization reaction, which is
followed by the formation of paraffin (Fig. 11Ac) and aromatics
(Fig. 11Ae) (secondary products). The concomitant appearance of
P27 and A69 probably proceeds from hydrogen transfer. Alkanes
could also result from olefin hydrogenation, but in this case one
part of the produced hydrogen should be consumed. The A69/
P27M ratio is lower than 3 (Fig. 12), indicating that one part of
the aromatics continues to be transformed into polyaromatic com-
pounds (coke) (Fig. 11Af). Therefore, the reaction scheme of pro-
pane aromatization is similar whatever the method used for the
synthesis of the bifunctional catalyst (Scheme 1).
The main difference concerns the coke quantity in the catalysts,
which ranks as follows: [Ga]-MFI  Ga/P > Ga + P. Surprisingly, the
coke formation is more rapid on the less acidic bifunctional cata-
lysts, and in the case of the gallosilicate catalyst, coke appears
practically as a primary product.
Fig. 13a compares the initial conversion of propane as a func-
tion of the gallium content on the three types of catalysts. The
behavior of Ga + P and Ga/P series is similar: fast initial increase
of the propane conversion with the gallium content up to a maxi-
mum of 40% at 2.5 wt% Ga, followed by a slow decrease of conver-
sion. The effect of the gallium content on the bifunctional catalysts
prepared by ionic exchange or by mechanical mixture in the pro-
pane aromatization leads to similar product yields (Fig. 11B); all
the yields increase with the gallium content to reach a plateau
more or less rapidly: H2 (8%), P27 (10%), O28 (5%), A69 (10%),
and that of CH4 passes through a maximum at a gallium content
of 2.5 wt%. Only the coke deposit is impacted by how the bifunc-
tional catalyst is prepared; the coke formation is much greater
on the IE catalyst series (Fig. 11Bf).
By comparing the catalysts at the same gallium content, pro-
pane conversion (Fig. 13a), as well as product yields (Fig. 11B), is
lower on the gallosilicate catalyst than on a ZSM-5 zeolite doped
with gallium. A low Si/Ga is required to synthesize a gallosilicate
catalyst as active as Ga + P and Ga/P catalysts: their yields of prod-
ucts tend to increase up to the same plateau as obtained with IE or
MM catalyst series, but a much higher gallium content is necessary
to reach them.
3.3. Characterization of spent catalysts
The coke and carbon content after 1 h of aromatization reaction
on 5% Ga + P, 2.5% Ga/P, and 4.7% [Ga]-MFI are practically the same,
ca. 2 wt%. Table 4 reports the properties of these spent catalysts,
such as pore volume, external surface, and acidity, and those of
the coke formed in these catalysts, such as content, solubility,
and oxidation temperature.
After the aromatization reaction, the infrared spectra (in the OH
region) of the 5%Ga + P and 4.5%Ga/P reported in Fig. 3 indicate
that the peak at 3611 cm1 (related to the SiAOHAAl band) par-
tially reappears after its disappearance during the reductive treat-
ment of the corresponding catalysts. This reappearance, which is
concomitant with the increase of [PyH+] and the decrease of
[PyL] (Tables 3 and 4), results from a reoxidation of the exchanged
gallium species. The reoxidation could occur either during the
unloading of the reactor or during the aromatization reaction.
Whatever the cause, it means that the reductive exchange is rever-
sible. On the exchanged catalyst, the appearance and disappear-
ance of BAS and LAS, respectively, are related to a stoichiometry
of 1:3 (true value 3.3), while on the catalyst prepared by mechan-
ical mixture, this 1:1. The excess of LAS on MM catalyst indicates
that
a
new
type
of
LAS
are
created
during
the
propane
transformation.
Bands of carbonaceous deposits are present in two IR spectra
domains (Fig. 14): In the (i) 27003100 cm1 region, where bands
at 2954 and 2932 cm1 are assigned to the asymmetric stretching
mode of CH3 and CH2 groups, respectively, and at 2873 cm1 to the
symmetric stretching mode of CH3 [33], and in the (ii) 13001700
cm1 region, which combines different stretching modes of C@C in
condensed and noncondensed aromatics and bending vibrations of
CH. The bands at 14651506 cm1 can be attributed to coke pre-
cursor molecules (number of aromatic rings limited to 2 and 3)
and the other bands (1616, 1588 cm1) to polyaromatic coke, while
the band at 1380 cm1 is attributed to the angular deformation of
the CAH bond [33]. On the three catalysts, the coke is complex and
constitutes polyalkyl polyaromatic molecules. The temperature
required to burn it is high, ca. 810 K (Table 4).
The trapped coke molecules are liberated from the catalyst by
digestion of the zeolite framework with a hydrofluoric acid solu-
tion. One fraction of coke can be recovered by a simple liquidliq-
uid extraction using methylene chloride as a solvent (Csoluble); the
other fraction is insoluble (Cinsoluble) and forms black particles in
the suspension. Regardless of the different types of catalysts, the
totality of coke is insoluble (Table 4), which confirms its polyaro-
matic character. The MALDI-TOF mass spectrum of the insoluble
coke (Fig. 15) shows on the gallosilicate ([Ga]-MFI) a wide molec-
ular weight distribution from 200 to >700 Da with a maximum
centered at 420 Da, and on 5%Ga + P and 4.5%Ga/P a wide distribu-
tion that begins from 300 Da with a maximum at 430 Da. The
structure of the insoluble coke deduced from the exact molar
weight is extremely complex, with a number of aromatic rings
(NR) of at least 5 and possibly >15. A molar weight of 420 Da cor-
responds to 10 NR (Table SI.2). The formation of the heavy coke is
due to the high reaction temperature; at moderate temperature

(>550 K) the coke formation follows a shape selectivity mecha-
nism, while at high temperature its growth is so rapid so that it
tends to overflow on the crystal surface.
The formation of aromatic rings requires many catalytic succes-
sive steps: oligomerization, isomerization, cyclization, and hydro-
gen transfer, some of which require strong Brnsted acid sites.
Indeed, the strength of the acid plays a determining role both in
the formation and in the growth of the coke [34]. As on gallosilicate
the acid strength is lower than on aluminosilicate [35], the growth
of coke is slower, and therefore the number of aromatic rings
lower.
The coke, which is heavy, is also extremely toxic. Indeed, in
the most favorable scenario, assuming that the totality of coke is
located in the micropores and its density is equal to 1 (which is

false; it should be higher), the real volume occupied by 2 wt% coke
would be equal to 0.02 cm3, which is three times lower than the
pore volume that has disappeared (see Table 4). Hence, deactiva-
tion by this heavy coke seems to occur by pore blocking. As a
reminder, the deactivation on MFI-type zeolite (a tridimensional
pore structure), known to be resistant to coking, usually proceeds
by poisoning.
4. Discussion
Two series of bifunctional Ga-MFI catalysts, in which the gal-
lium cation is either on the external surface (Ga/P) or separated
(Ga + P) from the zeolite crystal, are used to highlight the differ-
ence arising during the reductive solid ionic exchange (RSIE) mech-
anism. The reduction treatment carried out at high temperature on
Ga/P and Ga + P series yields a lot of modifications: change of the
morphology of the gallium oxide (Fig. 1), disappearance of the
bridging hydroxyl bands (Fig. 3), diminution of the concentration
of Brnsted acid sites, which is concomitant with the increase of
that of Lewis acid sites (Table 3, Fig. 4), and increase of the Si/Ga
ratio of the external surface (Fig. 6). All these changes show that
a solid ionic exchange occurs during the reduction treatment
regardless of the initial location of gallium (Scheme 2). The migra-
tion of gallium cations implies the formation of a mobile species,
gallium suboxide (Ga2O) [3,9,15,21,2628,3640], by which its for-
mation is confirmed by the TPR results (Fig. 5). Ga2O is able to dif-
fuse within the zeolite micropores to the protonic site. The
reductive solid ionic exchange occurs up to complete exchange
with the bridged OH groups (Fig. 3), after which the nanoparticles
of gallium oxide accumulate on the external surface (crystal) of the
zeolite (Fig. 1).
The RSIE mechanism is faster on Ga/P than on Ga + P catalyst
series (Figs. 4 and 5, Table 3). This behavior is also observed by
Southward et al. [18]. The authors compared the reduction temper-
ature (TR) of two mechanical mixtures that differ by the ball
milling time (tmilling) and concluded that with increasing of tmilling,
TR decreased but is still higher than that obtained with a catalyst
prepared by ionic exchange. This suggests that a close intimacy
between the gallium species and the zeolite particles is required.
The reductive solid ionic exchange mechanism automatically
induces an additional step in the case of Ga + P catalysts due to
the physical separation of the two oxides: the gas phase diffusion
of the gallium suboxide, which is slower than the surface diffusion.
The proportion of gallium in the IE series that migrates and reacts
with the BAS remains limited despite a strong proximity between
Ga2O3 and the zeolite: only a quarter on the least loaded catalyst
(Table 3). Moreover, this proportion decreases with the increase
in tGa content. On the bifunctional catalyst prepared by mechani-
cal mixture, the percentage of mobile gallium does not exceed 5%.
Although the rate of reductive solid ionic exchange depends on the
initial position of Ga, the reduction treatment leads to the same
dehydrogenation sites (DHS). The identical catalytic results (activ-
ity, stability) of propane aromatization (Figs. 10 and 13) and of
cyclohexane dehydrogenation (Fig. 9) regardless of the catalyst
preparation (IE or MM) demonstrate that the amount of DHS
formed depends only on the gallium content.
The gallium oxides and protonic zeolite independently are not
able to dehydrogenate cyclohexane (Fig. 9); they can do so when
combined. The dehydrogenation and aromatization of propane
occur on the same active centers in Ga/P and Ga + P catalysts. Iden-
tical dehydrogenation properties do not necessarily imply the
same acidic properties. Indeed, on reduced Ga/P and Ga + P cata-
lysts, they are slightly different; the decrease of the concentration
of Brnsted acid sites is less when Ga oxides are initially distant
(Fig. 4). If only the active gallium species, i.e., the gallium located
in the MFI zeolite micropores (Gaz; Table 3) are considered, the
conversion of propane decreases with the increase in their concen-
tration (Fig. 13b). This trend is ascribable to the decrease in CH4
selectivity (Fig. 16a) due to the decrease in BAS concentration
(Table 3). The selectivities of olefins and aromatics (Fig. 16b, 16c)
remain constant with an increase in the Gaz content, while that
of paraffins increases (Fig. 16c). The presence of strong BAS leads
to side reaction such as cracking, which is particularly important
in the case of the cyclohexane dehydrogenation on the Ga + P ser-
ies. In spite of this difference, the selectivity at the same conversion
(Fig. 11) is identical in propane aromatization on the two catalyst
series; moreover, it is also the same on the gallosilicate series
([Ga]-MFI catalysts), although these catalysts are exempt of strong
Brnsted acid sites. The low cracking activity of [Ga]-MFI catalysts
is confirmed by the high selectivity for benzene in the dehydro-
genation of cyclohexane (Fig. 9). The identical selectivity on the
three series, despite the presence or the absence of aluminum
atom in the zeolite framework, is surprising (Fig. 11Ae). For exam-
ple, the methane formation could result from protolytic cracking in
the presence of strong Brnsted acid sites, as is the case with the H-
ZSM-5 zeolite (carbenium mechanism [5,35]); but in the case of
gallosilicate, there is none, and the yield in methane increases with
the gallium content (Fig. 11Bb). Hence, the methane formation on
gallosilicate should come from propane activation on the gallium
species via an alkyl mechanism, as proposed by Van Santen
and others [41] and as suggested by Price et al. [42], the propane
activation arises from Lewis acidbase pair action of the gallium
cations and the neighboring zeolite oxygen anions (basic site).
Recently, Schreiber et al. [28] proposed that the active sites for pro-
pane dehydrogenation in Ga/H-ZSM-5 with a Si/Al ratio of 50 are
LewisBrnsted acid pairs (Scheme 3).
This type of bisite appears particularly active in the oligomer-
ization reaction, with the formation of heavy and very toxic coke.
It is worth mentioning that the high coke content and the low cat-
alytic performance of [Ga]-MFI could be due to the very large size
of the crystal (Fig. 2) and to the weak strength of protonic sites,

respectively. Moreover, the location and the repartition of gallium
within the crystals do not impact the activity, selectivity, and sta-
bility (Figs. 2 and 12). Finally, the temperature used for the pre-
treatment of [Ga]-MFI catalysts (873 K) is too low to cause the
degallation and formation of extra-framework gallium species
[11]. Hence, the framework gallium in the [Ga]-MFI series is less
active than the extra-framework gallium present in the reduced
Ga + P and Ga/P series. For example, for a gallium content of 0.4
wt% in the zeolite, the aromatic yield is six times higher on catalyst
with extra-framework gallium species than with Ga located into
the framework.
5. Conclusions
Three series of gallium-based catalysts were prepared by
hydrothermal synthesis of gallosilicate, mechanical mixing (MM),
and ionic exchange (IE). On MM and IE catalyst series, an ionic solid
exchange occurs during the reduction treatment, which yields to
catalysts with identical acidic and hydrogenating properties;
therefore, the same catalytic performances result in both propane
aromatization and cyclohexane aromatization. The reduced alumi-
nosilicates doped with gallium are more active than the gallosili-
cate series. There is one difference between IE and MM catalyst
series, concerning the coke formation, which is higher on the IE
catalyst series than on the MM series. On the three catalyst series,
the coke is heavy and located within the zeolite micropores, which
makes it extremely toxic. The presence of intracrystalline meso-
pores can be a good option for mitigating the coke toxicity by lim-
iting its growth in the zeolite micropores, owing to better diffusion
of coke precursors.
