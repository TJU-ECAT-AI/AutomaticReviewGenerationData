Abstract
Catalytic conversion of propane to propylene can be achieved by non-oxidative propane dehydrogenation (PDH) by Pt-based catalysts under 550700 C. In this work, we report a strategy to decrease the Pt loading amount to only 0.1 wt% for obtaining a stable catalyst via silica coating for high PDH activity at a temperature as low as of 450 C. The as-prepared 2.5%Si@PtGa/Al2O3 catalyst shows outstanding catalytic activity (propylene productivity rate 0.5 mol/gcat.·h) close to its equilibrium conversion (24.5%) with much better stability (deactivation constant: 0.007 h1) at 450 C. The interface between catalyst and silica coating changes the strong metal-support interaction (SMSI) to immobilize the Ga oxide clusters, further tightly anchoring the Pt catalytic sites for PDH process. Moreover, the electronic state of Pt is also influenced by the silica coating layers. This work demonstrates a new method to harnessing the metal-support interaction in catalysis.

1. Introduction
Propylene is one of the most important building blocks for industrial production to many chemical products including polypropylene, which is an essential material to prepare non-woven fabric for personal protection equipment amid global COVID-19
[1]
,
[2]
,
[3]
. Due to the increasing global demand for propylene, the market price of propylene has been rising accompanied with the booming trend of industrial development
[4]
,
[5]
,
[6]
,
[7]
,
[8]
. Therefore, many efforts have been devoted to the transformation of propane into propylene stimulated by the large scale production of propane by the development of shale-gas extraction
[9]
. To date, Pt-based catalysts have been extensively used as industrial catalysts for propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) with a desirable performance in Oleflex process for its longer reaction lifetime and more environmental friendly
[10]
. However, the wider application is still hampered since the usage of noble metal and catalyst deactivation. Thus, its still necessary to develop a low cost catalyst for the PDH regarding to utilization of natural gas resources
[11]
,
[12]
,
[13]
.
The PDH process is featured by its high endothermicity (Hθ298 = 124.3 kJ mol1)
[4]
,
[14]
, which requires high reaction temperature (550700 C)
[15]
,
[16]
,
[17]
,
[18]
. Such harsh reaction conditions compose a chanllege to the thermal stability of the catalyst. Alkane activation at the lower temperature (<500 C) has attracted more and more research interest for a series of merits, such as reducing the energy consumption and inhibiting of coking and sintering
[19]
,
[20]
,
[21]
,
[22]
,
[23]
,
[24]
,
[25]
. Considering the thermodynamics equilibrium limitation as the function of temperature for PDH (
Fig. S10
), realizing the PDH process with good catalytic performance at the lower temperature is an emerging significant challenge. Hence, the exploitation of high-activity catalysts capable of good catalytic performance in PDH reaction at low temperature is quite urgent.
Among those most promising catalysts for PDH reaction, the single-atom Pt catalyst has been wildly investigated and applied for its unique advantages such as the well-defined isolated active sites, distinct and superior catalytic performance
[26]
,
[27]
,
[28]
,
[29]
,
[30]
. The atomic dispersed Pt sites can readily dissociate the first and second CH bonds of alkanes at low temperature, and minimize the side reactions to coke formation effectively
[9]
,
[31]
. However, due to the high surface Gibbs free energy of isolated Pt active sites, agglomerating and sintering could occur during catalysis, which would further result in catalyst deactivation
[32]
,
[33]
,
[34]
,
[35]
,
[36]
. Many strategies have been developed for rational design of PDH catalyst. For example, the post-transition metal elements (e.g. Sn, Zn, Ga, In) have been explored as co-catalyst to improve the dispersion, geometric structure and electronic properties of Pt for increasing the activity, selectivity, stability and anti-coking performance
[37]
,
[38]
,
[39]
,
[40]
,
[41]
,
[42]
. The introduction of co-catalyst species such as Ga could regulate the strong metal-support interaction (SMSI) between metal and oxide support, and further help to maintain the dispersion of Pt species
[9]
,
[29]
,
[36]
. On the other hand, the thermal stability of catalyst and the resistance to coke formation can be improved by coating inorganic oxide shells on the catalyst as a physical barrier to prevent the aggregation of Pt species
[41]
,
[43]
,
[44]
. Lu et al. reported that the Pd/Al2O3 catalyst surface can be well regulated through depositing controllable Al2O3 overcoating
[45]
. The anti-sintering ability of Pd particles is greatly improved and the adsorption affinity of product molecules on Pd species is weakened due to the confinement effect of Al2O3 atomic layers
[45]
.
In this work, we report that the PtGa/Al2O3 catalyst coated with silica overlayer shows excellent catalytic performance and stability for the PDH reaction at low temperature (450 C). A series of catalysts with different silica coating amount by introducing controlled silica amount on the catalysts surface (as shown in
Scheme 1
). The 2.5%Si@PtGa/Al2O3 has shown the most stable catalytic activity for PDH at 450 C. Furthermore, the relationship between the structure and catalytic performance of catalysts have been investigated by inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometer (ICP-OES), nitrogen adsorption (BET), high angle annular dark field scanning transmission electron microscopy (HAADF-STEM), aberration corrected transmission electron microscope (AC-TEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), H2 temperature programmed reduction (H2-TPR), NH3 temperature programmed desorption (NH3-TPD), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectrum of CO (DRIFTS-CO), Raman spectrum, thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and differential scanning calorimetry (TG-DSC). The enhanced catalytic stability is attributed to the stable Pt active sites anchored by the Ga clusters as well as silica layers on the catalyst surface. This work explores alkane catalytic conversion at lower temperature and demonstrates a new method to improve thermal stability of catalyst.

2. Experimental section
2.1. Catalysts preparation
The γ-Al2O3 (99.99%, 20nm, Aladdin) was calcined at 700C in air for 2h before using. Nominal 0.1wt% Pt and 5wt% Ga supported on γ-Al2O3, denoted as PtGa/Al2O3, was synthesized via co-impregnation using Pt(NH3)4(NO3)2 (Pt, 50% basis, Sigma-Aldrich) and Ga(NO3)3·xH2O (99.9%, Aladdin) dissolved in deionized water. After impregnation, the catalysts were dried overnight in oven at 353K and calcined at 773K for 3h under air. The PtGa/HZSM-5 and PtGa/SiO2 were similarly prepared using HZSM-5 (NKF-5D-252, SiO2/Al2O3 = 27, Nankai University Catalyst Co., Ltd.) and silica (Kaimike Chemical Industry Trade Co., Ltd.) as supports. Pt/Al2O3 and Ga/Al2O3 catalysts with 0.1wt% Pt and 5wt% Ga on γ-Al2O3 support were also synthesized by incipient wetness impregnation method for comparison.
Silica coating on catalysts are according to the protocol in literature
[46]
. Typically, 0.30g of as-prepared PtGa/Al2O3, 40mL of ethanol, and 2mL of concentrated ammonium hydroxide (NH3·H2O, AR, 2528%, Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd.) were mixed under continuously stirring. Then, 20mL of ethanol with desired weight of tetraethyl orthosilicate (TEOS, AR, SiO2 >=28.4%, Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd.) was introduced into the above mixture by syringe pump at the rate of 40μL/min. After the mixture was stirred vigorously for another 12h, the products were obtained by centrifugation. The as-synthesized materials were dried at 353K and calcined at 623K in air for 2h (ramping rate 2C·min1) to obtain x%Si@PtGa/Al2O3 (x is the weight percent of Si in the overall catalyst). The actual Pt, Ga and Si content is further determined by ICP-OES.
2.2. Catalysts characterizations
Elemental composition of the catalysts was measured on a iCAP 7000 series ICP-OES (Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA). Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images and HAADF-STEM images were conducted on a FEI Talos F200S G2 microscope at 200kV (FEI, USA). The chemical components were carried out using a FEI Super-X energy-dispersive spectrum (EDS) system with a collection solid angle above 0.45 srad. XRD measurements were performed using an Ultimate III diffractometer (Rigaku, Japan) with Cu Kα (λ=1.5406Å) at 40kV and 25mA. The diffraction patterns were between 5 <2θ <90 with a scan speed of 10 per minute. The surface area and pore structure parameters of catalysts were analyzed by N2 adsorption-desorption isotherms at 77K on a Micromeritics ASAP 2020 plus (Micromeritics, USA). Before measurement, the samples were preheated under vacuum at 200C for 8h. The BJH method was used to calculate the mesoporous specific surface areas and volumes of the catalysts at the range of 250nm. The t-plot method was employed to calculate the micropore specific surface areas and volumes. H2-TPR was conducted on an AutoChem II 2920 chemisorption analyzer (Micromeritics, USA) equipped with a thermal conductivity detector (TCD). Prior to the TPR experiments, 0.1g of fresh catalyst was pretreated in flowing Ar at 300C for 2h. The temperature was raised from 50 to 800C under 10% H2/Ar at a flow of 30mLmin1 at a heating rate of 10Cmin1. NH3-TPD was carried out on an AutoChem II 2920 chemisorption analyzer (Micromeritics, USA) equipped with a thermal conductivity detector (TCD) for the detection of NH3. 0.2g of the fresh catalyst was pretreated inflowing He at 300C for 2h, and then cooling down to 50C for NH3 adsorption. This was achieved by feeding a constant 10% NH3/He flow to the reactor for 0.5h. Then, the flow gas was switched to pure He to remove weakly adsorbed NH3 until the baseline was stable. The catalyst was heated from 100 to 800C at a ramping rate of 10Cmin1.
XPS experiments were carried out on a Thermo Scientific ESCALAB 250 (Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA), and the data was acquired by a monochromatized Al Kα X-ray source (200W). The binding energies were referenced to the C 1s peak of environmental carbon at 284.6eV. The atomic resolution microscopy analysis was performed on a JEM ARM200F thermal-field emission microscope (JOEL, Japan) with a probe spherical aberration (Cs) corrector working at 200kV.
DRIFTS-CO adsorption experiments were collected on a Nicolet iS50 spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA). Typically, the catalyst was carefully transferred into the Praying mantis in situ cell (Harrick Scientific Product). Before the in situ DRIFTS-CO experiments, the catalyst was purged by Ar flow (>99.99%, 30mLmin1) for 30min at 300C. After the sample was cooled down to room temperature and collected the background spectrum, the 10% CO/Ar mixture gas was fed into the cell with a flow rate of 20mLmin1 followed by purging with Ar. The DRIFTS-CO spectra was obtained at steady-state by after the subtraction of the background spectra recorded before CO chemisorption.
Raman spectroscopy measurements were carried out on a DXRxi Raman microscope (Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA) with a 532nm excitation wavelength. The wavenumber values were measured over the range 4003100cm1 with an average of 30 scans. TG-DSC analysis was also used to characterize the used catalysts on a STA449F5 Jupiter thermal analyzer (Netzsch, Germany). The temperature was increased from 30 to 800C with a heating rate of 5Cmin1, and the air flow rate was 30mLmin1.
2.3. Catalytic activity tests
The catalytic experiment of PDH was carried out in a fixed-bed tubular quartz reactor under atmosphere pressure. In a typical test, 0.1g catalyst (4060 mesh) diluted with 0.4g quartz sand (4060 mesh) was filled into the quartz tube of 6mm inner diameter. The reactor was raised to 450C under pure Ar gas (20mLmin1) and then kept for 1h. Then, a mixture of 2.5% propane and 2.5% hydrogen (total 40mLmin1) were introduced for catalytic activity evaluation
[4]
,
[34]
. The feed and the products were analyzed by an on-line gas chromatograph (Shimazu GC-2014, Japan) equipped with HP-AL/S column (50m, 0. 53mm i.d., 15m film), one FID detector and one auto sampler. The conversion (XC3H8), selectivity (SC3H6), yield (YC3H6), propene productivity rate, TOF, carbon balance (CB) and deactivation constant (KD)

3. Results and discussion
3.1. the structure of silica coated PtGa/Al2O3 catalysts
The morphology of the used PtGa/Al2O3 and 2.5%Si@PtGa/Al2O3 catalysts were examined by TEM (
Fig. 1
). The lattice fringes of γ-Al2O3 and well definite edges are clearly seen on the non-silica coated PtGa/Al2O3 catalyst (
Fig. 1
a). The interplanar distances marked with white lines are 2.80 and 2.39Å, which correspond to the (220) and (311) crystal planes of γ-Al2O3, respectively. In the contrast, the overall lattice of γ-Al2O3 become ambiguous, and the epitaxial growth of amorphous silica layers appears at the edges of the silica coated 2.5%Si@PtGa/Al2O3 catalyst (
Fig. 1
c and d). No crystal grains of Pt or Ga are found in the TEM images of both samples. Moreover, EDS mapping result indicates that Si, Ga, Pt are uniformly dispersed on the surface of catalysts (
Fig. 2
), suggesting the amorphous silica are coating on the catalyst homogenously.

The actual weight fraction of the catalysts was examined by ICP-OES (
Table S1 and S2
). The actual Si content increased with the addition of TEOS corresponding to desired Si percentage content. As shown in the XRD patterns of catalysts in
Fig. 3
, the peaks appearing at 37.5, 45.7 and 66.8 are attributed to γ-Al2O3 phase of the fresh catalysts (PDF# 50-0741)
[48]
. No diffraction peaks of Ga and Pt are observed on these Pt/Ga based catalysts. Its deduced that the Ga and Pt phases are well distributed on the γ-Al2O3 support with extremely small size as atomic clusters. As the increasing of the introduced silica coating, a broad amorphous silica diffraction peak starts to appear on 20%Si@PtGa/Al2O3 catalyst at 23.

Fig. 3. The XRD patterns of the fresh catalysts.
The textural properties of the catalysts were investigated by the N2 adsorption via BET method (
Table 1
and
Fig. S1
). The typical adsorption-desorption isotherms of type IV indicates that all the catalysts are mesoporous materials accompanied by a small portion of micropores. As shown in
Table 1
, the surface area of mesopores is slightly increased from 126.3 to 156.3m2/g with the decline of micropores volume when Pt and Ga were loaded on Al2O3. The average pore width of 2.5%Si@PtGa/Al2O3 is 15.8nm, which is about 31% smaller than that of PtGa/Al2O3. The surface area and pores volume of mesopores decrease over the silica coated x%Si@PtGa/Al2O3 catalyst as the silica amounts increasing, which indicates that the introduction of silica into the interior of the mesoporous channel effectively modifies the internal structure of the channel. This phenomenon is also consistent with the average pore width variation (
Table S3
). However, the excessive amorphous silica phase is generated on the catalysts surface, resulting in the increase of micropores volume. Thus, the results of TEM, EDS, XRD and BET suggest that the introduced amorphous silica layer is well surrounded in the internal and external surfaces of the PtGa/Al2O3 catalyst.

3.2. Catalytic performance for propane dehydrogenation
As the control experiments, the 0.1wt% Pt had been loaded onto Al2O3 support to obtain highly dispersed Pt catalyst for exposing maximized active sites on the catalyst surface. However, it shows poor catalytic activity with only 5% C3H6 yield and rapid deactivation at the low temperature of 450C on Pt/Al2O3 catalyst (
Fig. S2a
). It is inferred that the sintering of Pt may occur during the catalytic process for its weak metalsupport interaction between Pt and Al2O3 support
[9]
,
[30]
. Hence, the quantity of surface active sites is decreased, leading to the catalyst deactivation. Controlled experiment shows that γ-Al2O3 support is not active for the PDH reaction under the same experimental condition (
Fig. S2b
).
The Ga was introduced to immobilize the Pt active sites in the PtGa/Al2O3 catalyst as a promoter. The initial propane conversion is 9.8% with poor stability (end conversion at 15h 4.8%) over Pt/Al2O3 catalyst (
Fig. S2a
), which indicates low performance of monometallic Pt active sites on γ-Al2O3 support. In comparison, PtGa/Al2O3 catalyst shows notably enhanced catalytic performance with 17.4% initial propane conversion (
Fig. 4
), which is 1.7 times higher than that of Pt/Al2O3 catalyst under identical conditions. Although the initial activity of the catalyst has been greatly improved over PtGa/Al2O3 catalyst, the stability of the catalyst is still poor due to the unstable Pt active sites. It has been reported that the presence of Al-O-Ga sites may promote heterolysis C-H bond activation
[49]
. However, in this study, the trace amounts of Pt active sites are mainly responsible for catalytic dehydrogenation of propane at low temperature (450C), while the monometallic Ga catalyst shows minimum activity at the same reaction condition (
Fig. S2c
) and the related catalytic activities of different Ga species are discussed in detail in the
