I'm going to give you a scientific literature. Then I'm going to ask you some questions about it. I'd like you to first write down exact quotes of parts of the document word by word that would help answer the question, and then I'd like you to answer the question using facts from the quoted content. Do not omit any relevant information from the text, and avoid introducing any falsehoods or assumptions that aren't directly supported by the literature. Here is the literature, in <literature></literature> XML tags:

Abstract
Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) is an industrial technology for direct propylene production, which has received extensive attention and realized large-scale application. At present, the commercial Pt/Cr-based catalysts suffer from fast deactivation and inferior stability resulting from active species sintering and coke depositing. To overcome the above problems, several strategies such as the modification of the support and the introduction of additives have been proposed to strengthen the catalytic performance and prolong the robust stability of Pt/Cr-based catalysts. This review firstly gives a brief description of the development of PDH and PDH catalysts. Then, the advanced research progress of supported noble metals and non-noble metals together with metal-free materials for PDH is systematically summarized along with the material design and active origin as well as the existing problems in the development of PDH catalysts. Furthermore, the review also emphasizes advanced synthetic strategies based on novel design of PDH catalysts with improved dehydrogenation activity and stability. Finally, the future challenges and directions of PDH catalysts are provided for the development of their further industrial application.

Here are the question lists, in <questions></questions>XML tags:
<questions>


How has the growing demand for propylene influenced the development of new production methods, particularly propane dehydrogenation (PDH), and how has the understanding of Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts for PDH evolved, including the ongoing debate about active Ga species and recent research findings that have contributed to our current knowledge of these catalysts?


</questions>

First, you need to sequentially extract any quotes in the literature that are most relevant to each question, and print them in numbered order, separated by newlines. Quotes should be relatively brief. Do not attempt to summarize or answer questions at this stage, but simply repeat exactly what the corresponding part of the literature says.

Please enclose the full list of quotes in <quotes></quotes> XML tags. If there are no relevant quotes, write "No relevant quotes" instead.

Then, answer the question, starting with "Answer:".  Do not include or reference quoted content verbatim in the answer. Don't say "According to Quote [1]" when answering. Do not write reference number of quotes after answer. Put your answer to the user inside <EnglishVersionAnswer></EnglishVersionAnswer> XML tags. Output formatted text, with line breaks for each question.Separate quotes and answers with a blank line. Provide the answers to all questions in English. After completing the English answers, translate all those answers into Chinese and provide the Chinese version inside <ChineseVersionAnswer></ChineseVersionAnswer> XML tags.

Thus, the format of your overall response should look like what's shown between the <example></example> tags.  Make sure to follow the formatting and spacing exactly.
