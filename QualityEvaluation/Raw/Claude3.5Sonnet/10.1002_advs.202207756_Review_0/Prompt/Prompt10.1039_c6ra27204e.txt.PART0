Catalytic performance of gallium oxide based-
catalysts for the propane dehydrogenation
reaction: effects of support and loading amount
Chun-Tao Shao, Wan-Zhong Lang,* Xi Yan and Ya-Jun Guo*
The different materials (ZSM-5, SBA-15, g-Al2O3 and SiO2) were used as supports for Ga2O3-based catalysts
for the propane dehydrogenation reaction, and the effect of Ga2O3 content (19 wt%) for xGa2O3/SBA-15
catalysts on the catalytic activity was discussed. It is found that the supports determine the porous features,
the state and dispersion of Ga species, and the acidbase properties of the corresponding catalysts. The
existence of strong acid sites in catalyst can lead to more well-dispersed Ga species. The satisfied
catalytic performances are obtained over 5Ga2O3/ZSM-5 and 5Ga2O3/SBA-15 catalysts. Among the
Ga2O3-based catalysts with different supports, the 5Ga2O3/ZSM-5 sample exhibits the highest catalytic
activity, which possesses the maximum well-dispersed gallium species and high dehydrogenation
efficiency gallium ions (Gad+ cations, d < 2), and the 5Ga2O3/SBA-15 catalyst exhibits the highest catalytic
stability. Furthermore, as for the xGa2O3/SBA-15 samples, the 5Ga2O3/SBA-15 sample exhibits the best
catalytic performance. The initial propane conversion and propylene selectivity are above 32.0% and
90.0% respectively, and a final propane conversion of 17.0% is obtained after 30 h reaction. With the
increase of Ga loading, the Ga species are easily agglomerated and destroy the structural integrity of the
SBA-15 support, which is unfavorable to the propane dehydrogenation reaction.

Introduction
Propylene is a major raw chemical for the petrochemical
industry. In recent years, more attention has been paid to the
catalytic dehydrogenation of propane to propylene because the
growing demand for propylene is beyond the production
capacity of conventional hydrocarbon steam cracking and
catalytic cracking processes.13 The catalytic dehydrogenation of
propane is an endothermic process, which needs a relatively
high reaction temperature to obtain a high propylene yield.
Nevertheless, under such high temperatures, the undesirable
side reactions such as hydrogenolysis, cracking and coke
deposition are inevitable.4,5
Currently, many studies are devoted to developing novel and
potential catalysts in propane dehydrogenation (PDH), such as
ceria-based catalysts,6 calcined hydrotalcite-supported plat-
inum catalysts,7 Sn/SiO2 catalysts,8 Pd-based catalysts,9 meso-
porous carbons, gallium oxide-based catalysts10,11 and so on.
Among these, gallium oxide-based catalysts have been recog-
nized as new promising alkane dehydrogenation materials due
to their unique capability to activate hydrocarbon species and
excellent catalytic efficiency as compared to conventional Cr2O3-
and V2O5-based catalysts.1216 For instance, Nakagawa et al.14
proposed that the commercial Ga2O3 had exceptionally high
activity for the dehydrogenation of ethane to ethylene, and they
found that b-Ga2O3 exhibited the highest dehydrogenation
activity among all of the polymorphs due to its abundant
surface acid sites.
The support effects of catalysts were also considered to be an
important topic. Previous studies11,1619 reported that the Ga2O3
species were dispersed on different supports including TiO2,
MgO, Al2O3, ZrO2, ZSM-5, HZSM-48 and MWW zeolites for
alkane dehydrogenation reaction. Many literatures verified that
acidity of support evidently inuenced the catalytic perfor-
mance of the supported catalysts. For example, Shen et al.20
reported that the stability and selectivity of Ga2O3/HZSM-5
catalyst in the propane dehydrogenation were enhanced by
increasing the Si/Al ratio of HZSM-5 support. XU et al.16 reported
that Ga2O3/TiO2, Ga2O3/Al2O3 and Ga2O3/ZrO2 showed better
activity for the dehydrogenation of propane to propylene than
Ga2O3/SiO2 and Ga2O3/MgO due to the more acid sites in
medium to strong strength. Wang et al.19 revealed that Ga/ITQ-2
exhibited higher selectivity and better stability in propane
dehydrogenation reaction as compared with those of Ga/MCM-
22, due to the higher surface area and relatively less strong acid
sites.
Since gallium oxide-based catalysts were found to have good
alkane dehydrogenation properties,14,15,21 several investigations

attempted to elucidate the reasons of high catalytic perfor-
mance. The previous studies reported that the gallium oxides
(Ga2O3, GaO+) were the most species presented on the catalyst
aer calcination and were readily reduced during pretreatment
with hydrogen.16,2224 The various gallium species (Ga2O3, GaO+
and Ga+) as active constituents exhibited different perfor-
mances for light alkane dehydrogenation reaction.25 In addi-
tion, Nowak et al.26 also reported the dispersion of Ga2O3
species varied with different supports. However, the effects of
supports on the state of gallium species have not been fully
understood, especially the causes of these changes.
Among these support materials, alumina is extensively used
as catalyst support due to its surface acidic properties and
desirable textual properties. Nevertheless, the stability of cata-
lyst is still not very satisfactory.27,28 As regards ZSM-5 zeolite, it
has some particular physical properties such as unique three-
dimensional channels, relatively large surface area and adjust-
able Si/Al ratio. Especially it can hinder the formation of large
hydrocarbon molecules due to the unique framework and
channel structure, which are beneficial to the catalytic stability.
Therefore, ZSM-5 is widely used in propane dehydrogenation
reaction.29,30 Besides, as advanced mesoporous materials, SBA-
15 and nano-silica are oen employed as supports for cata-
lysts. Generally, SBA-15 is characterized by its ordered porous
structure, high specific surface area and high thermal stability,
and the certain pore volume of mesoporous materials and the
free of acid sites can greatly resist the formation of coke.31,32
Nano-silica also has the characteristics of large surface area,
chemical stability and cheapness.33 It is obvious that the cata-
lysts using different supports may show the distinctive catalytic
properties. Hence it is necessary to discuss the inuences of the
different supports on the catalytic performances for Ga2O3-
based catalysts in propane dehydrogenation. Nevertheless,
according to what I'm informed, the detailed investigations of
different supports on the catalytic performances for Ga2O3-
based catalysts are rarely reported, especially with SBA-15
material as support.
The objective of this work is to study the inuences of
different supports on the state of gallium and the catalytic
performances of Ga2O3-based catalysts for propane dehydro-
genation, and further discuss the optimum Ga2O3 loading
content and reaction parameters of Ga2O3/SBA-15 catalysts in
propane dehydrogenation. A series of different supports (ZSM-
5, SBA-15, g-Al2O3 and SiO2) were prepared, and then loaded
with Ga2O3 species by impregnation method. The as-prepared
samples were characterized by several state-of-art characteriza-
tions. The structureactivity relationships of the catalysts were
analyzed and elucidated.

Experimental
2.1
Catalyst preparation
The mesoporous SBA-15 was prepared according to the previous
literature.4 The triblock copolymer P123 (EO20PO70EO20, Mn 
5800, from Aldrich) was used as the structure-directing agent,
and tetraethyl orthosilicate (TEOS) was used as the silica source.
In brief, 4 g of P123 was added in 160 mL of 2 mol L1 HCl
aqueous solution and stirred for 0.5 h until fully dissolved, and
then 6.4 g of tetraethyl orthosilicate (TEOS) was slowly dripped to
the prepared mixture solution with strong stirring at 40 C for
24 h to get white gel. The resulting gel was subsequently trans-
ferred into a Teon autoclave and held at 100 C for 24 h. The
obtained sample was filtered and washed using deionized water,
and dried in a desiccator overnight. Then, the sample was
calcined in air at 550 C for 4 h to remove the structure-directing
agent to obtain final SBA-15 powder. Then, the synthesized SBA-
15 together with other three commercial materials including g-
Al2O3 (SBET: 180 m2 g1, 80100 mesh), ZSM-5 (Si/Al  4580) and
SiO2 (particle size  50 nm) were used as supports. The sup-
ported Ga2O3 catalysts were prepared by impregnating the
different supports with an aqueous solution of Ga(NO3)3$xH2O
(Aldrich). Aerward, the prepared samples were aged at room
temperature for 4 h, and then the catalysts were dried overnight
in air at 100 C, followed by calcination at 550 C for 4 h in air.
The 5Ga2O3/X and xGa2O3/SBA-15 catalysts were got. Unless
otherwise specified, as for the 5Ga2O3/X catalysts, the loading of
Ga2O3 was 5 wt%, where X represents the different support. The
prefix x of xGa2O3/SBA-15 samples indicates the different
amounts of Ga2O3 content varying from 1 to 9 wt%.
2.2
Catalyst characterizations
2.2.1
XRD. The X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of different
catalysts were obtained on a BraggBrentano diffract meter
(Rigaku D/Max-2000) with monochromatic Cu Ka radiation (l 
1.5418 
A). The XRD data were collected from 5 to 80 with a scan
speed of 2 min1. The X-ray tube was manipulated at 40 kV and
30 mA.
2.2.2
Low temperature N2 adsorption/desorption.
The
textural properties of different catalysts were measured by N2
adsorptiondesorption at liquid nitrogen temperature using an
automatic analyzer (NOVA 4000, Quantachrome, USA). Before
adsorption, the catalysts were degassed for 4 h at 300 C. The
specific surface areas of the samples were calculated using the
BrunauerEmmettTeller (BET) method. The pore structural
data were analyzed by the BJH (BarrettJoynerHalenda)
method using Halsey equation for multilayer thickness.
2.2.3
FESEM. The morphologies of different catalysts were
examined by a field emission scanning electron microscopy
(FESEM, HITACHI S-4800) operated at 5.0 kV.
2.2.4
TEM. The transmission electron microscopy (TEM)
images of different catalysts were analyzed using a JEM-2010
microscope operated at 200 kV.
2.2.5
NH3-TPD. The acidity of different catalysts was
detected by temperature-programmed desorption of ammonia
(NH3-TPD). About 0.05 g of sample was placed into a quartz
reactor between two quartz wool plugs. The sample was pre-
treated at 400 C for 1 h under a dry helium ow (30 mL min1)
before being cooled to 120 C and saturated with adsorbed gas.
A thermal conductivity detector (TCD) was carried out from 120
to 800 C with an increasing rate of 10 C min1 to record NH3-
TPD profile.

temperature system. Prior to the analysis, the sample (0.2 g) was
treated by dry argon (15 mL min1) at 500 C for 1 h and then
the baseline was stabilized at 25 C for 60 min. Subsequently,
the quartz reactor was heated by a mixed ow of 10% H2 in Ar
from room temperature to 950 C with a heating rate of 10 C
min1. Finally, a TCD cell was employed to monitor and record
the consumption profiles of H2.

The

of
different catalysts were recorded on Perkin-Elmer PHI 5000C
ESCA using Al Ka radiation. All the samples were reduced in
a hydrogen ow at 580 C for 2.5 h. The binding energies (BE)
were calibrated using the C1s level at 284.8 eV as an internal
standard.

spent catalyst (0.05 g) was purged in owing N2 (15 mL min1)
at 500 C for 1 h. Then, the temperature was lowered to 40 C to
steady the baseline. Subsequently, the reactor was heated by
a mixed gas ow of 10% O2 in He from room temperature to
800 C at the rate of 10 C min1. Finally, a thermal conductivity
detector (TCD) cell was used to determine CO2.

mine the coke content on the spent catalysts with a LCT ther-
mogravimetric analyzer (DTG-60H), which was conducted from
room temperature to 800 C at a rising rate of 20 C min1 in
a 5% O295% He mixed ow (30 mL min1).
2.3
Propane dehydrogenation reaction
The propane dehydrogenation reactions were performed in
a quartz fix-bed reactor (8 mm in diameter). The catalyst (0.2 g)
was placed into the center of reactor, and the feed gas including
C3H8 and Ar (C3H8/Ar molar ratio  1 : 19, WHSV  0.6 h1) was
fed to the reactor. The propane dehydrogenation reactions were
carried out at 620 C and atmosphere pressure. A gas chroma-
tography (GC, SP-6890) equipped with a ame ionization
detector (FID) and an AT-PLOTPORA-Q capillary column was
employed to analyze the gas compositions. The propane
conversion
and
propylene
selectivity
were
calculated
by
formulas as:
C3H8 conversion  C3H8in  C3H8out/C3H8in
(1)
C3H6 selectivity  C3H6out/(C3H8in  C3H8out)
(2)
where C3H8in and C3H8out are the propane content in feed and
exit steams respectively; C3H6out is the propylene content in exit
steam.

Results and discussion
3.1
Textural properties
To evaluate the textural properties of catalysts, the low-
temperature N2-physisorption isotherms were conducted and
shown in Fig. 1(a) and (b). All the xGa2O3/SBA-15 and 5Ga2O3/
Al2O3 catalysts exhibit typical type IV adsorption isotherm with
a H1-type hysteresis loop as defined by IUPAC, implying the

presence of mesoporous structure. Moreover, the isotherms of
xGa2O3/SBA-15 catalysts show comparatively sharp step with the
increase of relative pressure (P/P0) as compared with that of
5Ga2O3/Al2O3 sample. According to the previous studies,34 this
is the characteristic of capillary condensation of nitrogen in
ordered mesopores. The low-temperature N2-physisorption
isotherm for 5Ga2O3/ZSM-5 is also illustrated in Fig. 1(a). It
shows type I adsorption isotherm with a plateau at higher
relative pressure in accordance with the microporous nature of
limited mesoporosity of the samples (BDDT classifications31).
Furthermore, the type H3 (according to IUPAC) hysteresis loop
can be noticed for 5Ga2O3/SiO2 sample, which oen corre-
sponds with the slit-shaped pores.35 The textural properties of
the different catalysts are listed in Table 1. As can be seen, the
specific surface areas of all the catalysts are mainly determined
by the support materials. From Table 1, the specific surface area
(SBET) values of different Ga2O3-based catalysts are in the
following sequence: SBA-15 > ZSM-5 > Al2O3 > SiO2. As regards
xGa2O3/SBA-15 catalysts in Fig. 1(b), with the increase of
gallium oxide loading from 1 wt% to 9 wt%, the SBET and pore
volume (Vp) notably decrease, implying that gallium species
might penetrate into the mesoporous channels of SBA-15 and
lead the channels to be partially blocked. Moreover, as exhibited
in Fig. 2(c), the pore size distributions of xGa2O3/SBA-15 cata-
lysts are measured by the BJH model according to the desorp-
tion branches of the isotherms, and the pore diameter (Dp)
varies little with the increase of Ga2O3 addition.
3.2
XRD
The XRD patterns of the different catalysts are depicted in Fig. 2.
Apparently, the characteristic peaks of the corresponding
supports are found for all the samples, indicating that the
original structure of the support is not destroyed during the
catalyst preparation process. In addition, in the wide-angle
region (Fig. 2(a)), these materials do not exhibit the character-
istic peaks of Ga2O3 crystalline phases, probably due to their
small particle size and/or low concentration below XRD detec-
tion limitation. Moreover, the low-angle XRD patterns of
xGa2O3/SBA-15 samples are depicted in Fig. 2(b). As can be seen,
the unique diffraction planes of (100), (110) and (200) are
ascribed to the ordered two-dimensional hexagonal meso-
porous structures, and the diffraction peaks of mesoporous
structure vary little with the increase of Ga2O3 content from 1 to
5 wt%. As the Ga2O3 loading further increases to 7 wt% and 9
wt%, the peak intensity of (100) diffraction plane decreases
significantly, and the peak moves to smaller angle location,
suggesting that the introduction of overhigh Ga2O3 weakens the
degree of long-range order of SBA-15.36,37
3.3
FESEM and TEM
The FESEM images of the different catalysts are presented in
Fig. 3. As can be seen, the FESEM image of 5Ga2O3/ZSM-5
sample reveals highly crystalline zeolites of prismatic struc-
ture. In the cases of xGa2O3/SBA-15, they all show bound worm-
like feature with a relatively uniform size of about 1 mm.
However, with the increase of Ga2O3 content from 1 wt% to 9
wt%, the long-range worm-like morphology becomes chaos,
and the order degree of structure declines. It can be explained
that the increase of Ga2O3 content leads to the collapse of
molecular sieve structure.
The ordered porous structures of 5Ga2O3/ZSM-5 and xGa2O3/
SBA-15 samples were further observed by TEM. The images are
collected and showed in Fig. 4. From the TEM image of 5Ga2O3/
ZSM-5 sample, the well-ordered lattice fringes are clearly
distinguished

demonstrates the high crystallinity of ZSM-5. As for xGa2O3/
SBA-15 samples, the micrographs reveal the presence of well-
ordered hexagonal arrays of mesoporous channels. However,
as loading content increases to 9 wt%, less regular channels are
observed from Fig. 4(f). These TEM images are in good agree-
ment with the XRD, BET and SEM results. Furthermore, as
indicated by the arrows, the agglomerated gallium species can
also be noticed on 7Ga2O3/SBA-15 and 9Ga2O3/SBA-15 catalysts,
which implies that the dispersion of Ga species is not highly
homogeneous under high loading concentration.
3.4
NH3-TPD
The acidity of different catalysts was probed by temperature-
programmed desorption of ammonia method, and the corre-
sponding NH3-TPD curves are displayed in Fig. 5. The semi-
quantitative analysis is achieved by deconvoluting the peaks
using Gaussian curve fitting method. The calculated results
containing total acidity and acidity strength distribution are
summarized in Table 2. It is clear that 5Ga2O3/ZSM-5 catalyst
exhibits two ammonia desorption peaks. The first peak centered
(peak I) at 220 C is attributed to the weak acid sites; while the
second peak centered (peak II) at 420 C is attributed to the
strong acid sites.38 Furthermore, the largest strong acid sites
also can be observed over Ga2O3/ZSM-5 catalyst. From Fig. 5 and
Table 2, it can be seen that nearly half of total acidity is ascribed
to strong acid sites for 5Ga2O3/ZSM-5 catalyst. As regards the
5Ga2O3/Al2O3 catalyst, it displays three desorption peaks,
a broad desorption peak (peak I) centered at 190 C with
a shoulder (peak II) at higher temperatures 270 C and a peak
(peak III) with a maximal temperature (TM) centered at
480 C. It is generally accepted that these three desorption
peaks are ascribed to be weak, medium and strong acid sites
respectively.39 In comparison with 5Ga2O3/ZSM-5 and 5Ga2O3/
Al2O3 catalysts, the ammonia desorption peaks almost cannot
be visible over xGa2O3/SBA-15 and 5Ga2O3/SiO2 samples. This
phenomenon may be attributed to the inherent nature of pure
silicon support. From Table 2, though the xGa2O3/SBA-15
catalysts possess the very weak surface acidity, the acid prop-
erties still have some changes with the increase of Ga2O3
content. The 5Ga2O3/SBA-15 and 7Ga2O3/SBA-15 samples show
relatively high total acidity and weak to medium strong acid
sites as compared with those of other three samples, but the
change of the amount of strong acid sites is not obvious. The
previous studies demonstrated that undesirable side reactions
were easily initiated by the strong acid sites of catalysts.40 By
inference, the undesirable side reactions may easily occur over
5Ga2O3/ZSM-5 catalyst.
3.5
H2-TPR
To determine the effects of different supports and loading
amount on the reduction properties, H2-TPR technique was
implemented, and the curves of the corresponding fresh

catalysts are illustrated in Fig. 6(a). The semi-quantitative H2
consumption is summarized in Table 3, which is obtained by
fitting the H2-TPR curves using the Gaussian deconvolution
method. It can be seen that all the catalysts present two
reduction consumption peaks at about 600 C (peak I) and
900 C (peak II). As reported previously,26 the peak I is ascribed
to the reduction of well-dispersed Ga species, such as micro
Ga2O3 particles and/or GaO+ species interacting with the
support, and the peak II can be assigned to bulk Ga2O3 particles
and the loosely supported part of Ga2O3, respectively. In the
case of 5Ga2O3/ZSM-5, the strongest reduction peak I and the
weakest reduction peak II can be observed, implying that the
incorporated Ga species of 5Ga2O3/ZSM-5 catalyst are mostly
retained as well-dispersed Ga species. The analysis shows that
compared with 5Ga2O3/ZSM-5 catalyst, a weaker reduction peak
I and slightly stronger reduction peak II can be observed over
the 5Ga2O3/Al2O3 catalyst, suggesting that the amount of well-
dispersed Ga species on 5Ga2O3/Al2O3 catalyst is less than
that of 5Ga2O3/ZSM-5 catalyst. This phenomenon should be
highly related to the acidic properties of catalysts. As shown in
Table 4, the ratio of well-dispersed Ga in 5Ga2O3/ZSM-5 to
5Ga2O3/Al2O3 is approximately equal to that of the strong acid
peak
area
in
the
corresponding
samples.
This
similar
phenomenon was also mentioned by Ausavasukhi et al.25 In
addition, a small peak at about 690 C can be noticed, which
should be attributed to the reduction of OH groups or Al of
alumina support.41 On the other hand, Fig. 6(b) shows the TPR
curves of xGa2O3/SBA-15 catalysts. It can be seen that all the
samples also display similar two peaks, a small shoulder peak at
lower temperature and intensive one at very high temperature
even over 950 C. More specifically, the hydrogen consumption
areas of peak II over xGa2O3/SBA-15 catalysts increase as the
Ga2O3 content increases. The 5Ga2O3/SBA-15 catalyst exhibits
the strongest signal value among all the catalysts, which indi-
cates that the 5Ga2O3/SBA-15 sample possesses the largest
amount of well-dispersed Ga species. Furthermore, for all the
xGa2O3/SBA-15 catalysts, the peak intensity at about 600 C is
much weaker than those of 5Ga2O3/ZSM-5 and 5Ga2O3/Al2O3
catalysts. This phenomenon can be explained that the low
acidity of xGa2O3/SBA-15 catalysts is adverse to the dispersion of
Ga species. As for the TPR curve of 5Ga2O3/SiO2 sample, two
weak reduction peaks for Ga species can be found, which means
that the SiO2 support is hard to stabilize small Ga2O3 particles
or GaO+ species. It is very unfavorable to the reaction. The
similar results were also mentioned in previous reports.42,43

XPS
To further elucidate the chemical state of Ga species, XPS
analyses were measured. The XPS spectra and semi-quantitative
results of various catalysts are shown in Fig. 7 and Table 5
respectively. As can be seen in Fig. 7, 5Ga2O3/ZSM-5 and
5Ga2O3/Al2O3 catalysts present three peaks at 25 eV (peak I),
21 eV (peak II) and 19.8 eV (peak III) similar to the previous
literatures.16,44,45 The high binding energy (25 eV) is ascribed to
O2s band; the binding energy (21 eV) is assigned to Ga3d
band, and the low energy peak at 19.8 eV is attributed to Gad+
species (d < 2).45 From Table 5, the percentages of Gad+ species (d
< 2) for 5Ga2O3/ZSM-5 and 5Ga2O3/Al2O3 catalysts are about
62% and 11% respectively, implying that partial Ga2O3 is
reduced on these two supports during the catalyst preparation
process. The similar viewpoint was also reported in the previous
literature.46 As for xGa2O3/SBA-15 and 5Ga2O3/SiO2 catalysts,
there are two deconvoluted peaks (peak I and peak II). The
fraction of gallium in the oxidized state for xGa2O3/SBA-15
catalyst increases with the increase of Ga2O3 content from 1
to 9 wt%. Moreover, it can be seen from Table 5 that the Ga3d
banding energy of the gallium species in the Ga2O3/SiO2 is
reduced by 0.5 as compared with those in the other three
samples. It is remarkable that the Ga3d banding energy of the
gallium species in pure b-Ga2O3 is the same as that in 5Ga2O3/
SiO2 catalyst,44 indicating that using ZSM-5, Al2O3 and SBA-15
supports can strengthen the interaction between Ga species
and support. The similar conclusion was also reported by Xu
et al.18 These results imply that the different supports can play
a significant role in determining the chemical state of Ga
species.
3.7
Catalytic performances
3.7.1
Effect of different supports. The catalysts with
different supports were subjected to the propane dehydroge-
nation reaction for 30 h. The propane conversion and propylene
selectivity are displayed in Fig. 8. As can be seen, the initial
conversions of propane for different catalysts decrease in the
following order: 5Ga2O3/ZSM-5 > 5Ga2O3/Al2O3 > 5Ga2O3/SBA-15
> 5Ga2O3/SiO2. The 5Ga2O3/ZSM-5 catalyst shows the highest
initial propane conversion (78.1%), which is much higher than
those of the other samples. However, the worst stability of
5Ga2O3/ZSM-5 catalyst is found among all the samples. The
final propane conversion is only 11.5%. As regards the 5Ga2O3/
SBA-15 sample, although the initial conversion of propane is
29.7%, it exhibits the highest catalytic stability. The final
propane conversion still attains 21.4% aer 30 h of propane
dehydrogenation reaction. When the Al2O3 is chosen as the
support, the relatively high initial propane conversion (46.0%)
over 5Ga2O3/Al2O3 can be obtained, but the quick deactivation
of this sample is also observed, and the final conversion value is
only 5.3%. For the 5Ga2O3/SiO2 catalyst, a low and stable
propane conversion (around 5.5%) can be observed. The TOF
values of different catalysts at 20 h are calculated and included

in Table 6. It is remarkable that the TOF values show the similar
variation regularity to that of propane conversion over the cor-
responding catalysts. The highest TOF value can be found over
5Ga2O3/SBA-15 catalyst, indicating that it displays the high
dehydrogenation efficiency of Ga species.
From Fig. 8, it can be seen that the propylene selectivity
exhibits an apparent rise of for 5Ga2O3/ZSM-5 catalyst in the
initial several hours and then gradually stabilizes at around
89% aer 8 h reaction. The 5Ga2O3/Al2O3 catalyst presents the
highest initial propylene selectivity, and slightly decreases from
95.8% to 85.1% aer 30 h reaction. The propylene selectivity for
5Ga2O3/SBA-15 catalyst attains about 92.0% and varies little in
the whole 30 h reaction period. As for the 5Ga2O3/SiO2 sample,
a relatively low propylene selectivity of around 86% is observed.
The variation of the catalytic performances can be explained
as following. In general, for Ga2O3-supported catalysts, there are
three kinds of active centers in the fresh catalysts: well-
dispersed Ga species, GaO+ and bulk Ga2O3.25,47 The well-
dispersed Ga species and GaO+ usually have higher dehydro-
genation activity as compared with bulk Ga2O3.25 It can be seen
from the H2-TPR curves in Fig. 6 that the initial catalytic activ-
ities of different catalysts are in good agreement with the
amount of well-dispersed Ga species of the corresponding
catalysts. Furthermore, the TEM images also certify the exis-
tence of bulk Ga2O3 in 7Ga2O3/SBA-15 and 9Ga2O3/SBA-15
samples. Secondly, the researchers reported that the reduced
gallium ions (Gad+ cations, d < 2) were considered to be a reason
for the high activity, and monovalent Ga was regarded as the
second most active species.25,47,48 As shown in Fig. 7 and Table 5,
the content of the reduced gallium species on 5Ga2O3/ZSM-5
catalyst and 5Ga2O3/Al2O3 catalyst are 62% and 11% respec-
tively. Nevertheless, the reduced gallium species cannot be

found over the other two pure silica supported catalysts. In this
sense, this is another reasonable explanation for the much
better catalytic performance of 5Ga2O3/ZSM-5 than the other
three catalysts. Thirdly, as shown in Table 5, the weak interac-
tion between Ga species and SiO2 support is found for 5Ga2O3/
SiO2 sample, but the other three catalysts exhibit the strong
interactions between Ga species and the supports. This may be
the reason why 5Ga2O3/SiO2 catalyst possesses the lowest cata-
lytic activity. Finally, according to the textural parameters in
Fig. 1 and Table 1, the relatively high surface area and unique
structure of ZSM-5 support may be responsible for the relatively
high catalytic activity of 5Ga2O3/ZSM-5 catalyst.
As for the changes of propylene selectivity, it is well-known that
the strong acid sites generally promote the deep dehydrogenation
due to isomerization and coking reactions on the surfaces of
catalysts. Aromatization of propylene would also take place on the
Brnsted acid sites of supports. All these factors will lower
propylene selectivity.49 Moreover, not only the surface acidic
properties of support but also the active components can give rise
to the variation of propylene selectivity. The previous study has
proved that the dihydrogen molecule is dissociatively adsorbed on
gallium oxide on the catalyst surface, which may cause the
occurrence of hydrogenolysis reaction.50 With regards to 5Ga2O3/
ZSM-5 sample, the lowest selectivity in the initial hours must be
related to the strong acidity sites and well-dispersed Ga species,
which results in more side reactions (Fig. 9). Meantime, there also
exist the relatively high selectivities to methane and ethane
(Fig. 9), implying the occurrence of hydrogenolysis reaction, and
the following increased selectivity should be due to the cover of
acid sites by coke deposits. For the 5Ga2O3/Al2O3 catalyst, the
NH3-TPD results (Fig. 5) show that the strong acid sites are rela-
tively suitable, and thus the undesired side reactions can be
suppressed.
The
5Ga2O3/SBA-15
and
5Ga2O3/SiO2
samples
possess the relatively high propylene selectivity values among all
the samples, which are consistent with the extremely weak acidity.
3.7.2
Effect of Ga2O3 content. The catalytic performances
over xGa2O3/SBA-15 catalysts with different Ga2O3 content are
illustrated in Fig. 10. It can be observed that 5Ga2O3/SBA-15
sample shows the highest conversion, selectivity and catalytic
stability, which has the initial propane conversion and final one
of 31.7% and 30.3%. However, the higher or lower Ga2O3
loading amount both leads to a decline of initial propane
conversion. 1Ga2O3/SBA-15 sample exhibits the lowest catalytic
activity among all the catalysts. The TOF values of xGa2O3/SBA-
15 are also shown in Table 6. It can be seen that 1Ga2O3/SBA-15
sample has the highest TOF value, which should be ascribed to
the high Ga species dispersion under the minimum Ga2O3
loading. As for the other samples, the TOF values first increase,
and then decrease with the increase of the amount of gallium
oxide, and the 5Ga2O3/SBA-15 sample possesses the second
highest TOF value. This phenomenon can be probably attrib-
uted to the formation of bulk Ga2O3, which leads to the decline
of dehydrogenation efficiency of gallium oxide.
From Fig. 10, 5Ga2O3/SBA-15 catalyst presents the highest
propylene selectivity among all the samples. 1Ga2O3/SBA-15 and
9Ga2O3/SBA-15 catalysts show the relatively lower propylene
selectivities. Also, it is found that the propylene selectivity has
the similar variation trend to propane conversion with regard to
the Ga2O3 content for xGa2O3/SBA-15 catalysts.
The catalytic performances over the synthesized catalysts
with different loadings can be explained as following. According

to XRD, BET, SEM and TEM results, the high Ga2O3 content can
block the pores of SBA-15, destroy the structural integrity of
SBA-15 and lead to the formation of bulk Ga species on the
support. The H2-TPR curves in Fig. 6(b) also verify that more
well-dispersed Ga species exist on 5Ga2O3/SBA-15 sample,
which is in coincidence with the best catalytic performance.
Furthermore, as shown in Table 2, the catalytic performances of
xGa2O3/SBA-15 catalysts are closely related to the variation of
the total acid of the catalysts with respect to Ga2O3 content. It is
notable that the strong acid sites of xGa2O3/SBA-15 catalysts
almost vary little with the increase of Ga2O3 content, and all the
catalysts have the similar amounts of well-dispersed Ga species,
implying that the inuence of the amount of well-dispersed Ga
species is mostly related to the acidity rather than the loading
content of Ga2O3. When Ga content increases, the Ga species
begin to enrich in the form of large Ga2O3 clusters rather than
well-dispersed species. Ausavasukhi et al.43 also reported
a similar conclusion.
3.7.3
Effect of reaction temperature. Fig. 11 shows the
effect of reaction temperature on the performance of 5Ga2O3/
SBA-15
catalyst
in
propane
dehydrogenation.
The
initial
propane conversions of 21.7%, 28.3%, 33.8% and 45.0% are
obtained at 580, 600, 620 and 640 C respectively, and they
decrease to 16.1%, 20.4%, 26.6% and 36.0% aer 20 h reaction.
The initial propylene selectivities are 94.5%, 93.5%, 92.8% and
90% at 580, 600, 620 and 640 C respectively. The decreased
selectivity with the increase of temperature can be ascribed to
the side reactions like thermal cracking etc. Though the highest
propane conversion is achieved at 640 C at the expense of the
lowest selectivity, it is not a desirable reaction parameter.
Compared the results at 580 C with others, the propylene
selectivity evidently decreases at other three temperatures.
However, the initial propane conversion is only 16.1% when the
reaction is carried out at 580
C. In general, the reaction

temperature at 600620 C should be the ideal selection to
balance the conversion and selectivity of propane dehydroge-
nation reaction.
As mentioned above, in this work, coke is one main reason to
catalyst deactivation.51,52 The strong acidity can promote the
coke deposition on the catalyst surface.53 The total coke
amounts of the spent catalysts were analyzed by TPO and TG
measurements. It can be seen from Fig. 12 that all the TPO
curves of the spent catalysts present one major peak,54 which is
attributed to coke combustion on the catalysts. The peak for
5Ga2O3/SiO2 sample presents a relatively lower temperature
than the other three catalysts, meaning that the deposited coke
is easily combusted. Coke quantitative analysis (Table 6) is in
good agreement with TPO results, and the order of coke amount
is as follows: 5Ga2O3/ZSM-5 > 5Ga2O3/SBA-15 > 5Ga2O3/Al2O3 >
5Ga2O3/SiO2. The spent 5Ga2O3/ZSM-5 catalyst has the largest
coke amount (12.6%), which coincides with the propylene
selectivity in Fig. 8. In this case, as discussed before (Table 2),
the 5Ga2O3/ZSM-5 possesses the quite strong acidity. This
should be responsible for the largest amount of coke deposi-
tion. When SBA-15 material is used as the support, the second
most coke amount of 5Ga2O3/SBA-15 which has the low acidity
may owe to the high temperature, Ga species and largest SBET
value. From Table 6, a small amount of coke can be found on
pure SBA-15 support, implying that the propane thermal
cracking reactions are inevitable during the long-term reaction
at such a high reaction temperature (620). Furthermore, the
Ga2O3-based catalysts are known to be effective catalysts for
promoting
the
selective
conversion
of
light
alkanes
to
aromatics. Many authors agree that the aromatization reaction
occurs via a bifunctional mechanism. Not only strong acid sites
but also Ga species can enhance the dehydrogenation steps,
including the dehydrogenation of alkane, higher olefins, and
cycloolefins. Meriaudeau illustrated that the dihydrogen mole-
cule was dissociatively adsorbed on gallium oxide. These might
result in producing a large amount of coke precursors during
the process of reaction. Moreover, the mesoporous character
and high SBET of SBA-15 make the support have a certain pore
volume, which can contain the coke easily. On the contrary,
with respect to 5Ga2O3/g-Al2O3 catalyst, without high SBET value,
the coke deposition quickly covers the active sites, and results in
an evident decrease in the catalyst activity. When SiO2 material
is used as the support, the lowest amount of coke on the
5Ga2O3/SiO2 can be found, which is well coincident with the
dreadful catalytic activity.
As for xGa2O3/SBA-15 catalysts, the total coke amounts of the
spent catalysts are also illustrated in Table 6. The 5Ga2O3/SBA-
15 and 9Ga2O3/SBA-15 catalysts possess the lowest and highest
coke content among all the samples respectively, which are in
accord with the catalytic performance. Meanwhile, the different
reaction time (2 h and 30 h) on the nature of coke components
are also discussed. As can be seen from Fig. 13, the weight loss
between 0 and 300 C can be considered as the loss of surface
water and water adsorption phase, and the weight loss between
300 and 600 C is attributed to the coke combustion on the
catalyst surface. It should be noted that the weight loss trend of

different samples in the range of 200600 C are markedly
different, suggesting that the weight loss of these two samples
are caused by the combustion of different coke species. There-
fore, it can be concluded that the reaction time may play an
important effect on the graphitization degree of coke.
Table 7 displays some reports about the catalytic perfor-
mances of Ga2O3-based catalysts for propane dehydrogenation
reaction. The initial and final propane conversions and
propylene selectivities are collected. As can be seen from Table
7, the supports of catalyst have great inuence on the catalytic
performance, especially the propylene selectivity. The previous
presented the low propylene selectivity and catalytic stability.
However, the 5Ga2O3/SBA-15 catalyst in this study displays the
excellent catalytic stability accompanied with the relatively high
conversion and selectivity, and the catalytic stability is evidently
higher than those of the catalysts reported in literatures.

In this study, the inuences of different supports (ZSM-5, SBA-
15, g-Al2O3 and SiO2) and Ga2O3 loading on the properties and
catalytic performances of supported Ga2O3 catalysts for propane
dehydrogenation reaction were investigated. It can be found
that the intrinsic nature of supports and the loading amount
could
strongly
inuence
the
textual
properties,
surface
morphologies, acidic properties, dispersion of Ga species,
surface chemical states and coke formation, bringing about the
different catalytic performances of the corresponding catalysts.
In particular, the strong acid sites of catalyst largely determine
the dispersion of Ga species, but the strong acid sites also can
induce adverse side reactions. Thus, for Ga2O3-supported
catalysts in propane dehydrogenation reaction, striking an
appropriate balance between the roles of strong acid sites in
enhancing the reaction activity and that of decreasing the
selectivity and stability is essential.
Among the catalysts with different supports, the 5Ga2O3/
ZSM-5 catalyst shows the best catalytic activity and the lowest
catalytic stability, possesses the maximum gallium ions (Gad+
cations, d < 2), well-dispersed Ga species and strong acid sites.
The 5Ga2O3/SBA-15 catalyst exhibits the highest catalytic
stability, the highest SBET value and the lowest acidity. The
propane conversion only declines 11% aer reaction for 30 h. As
for xGa2O3/SBA-15 catalysts, the agglomeration degree of Ga
species gradually increased as the increase of Ga2O3 loading
amount. The 5Ga2O3/SBA-15 sample exhibits the highest cata-
lytic performance, possesses the most well-dispersed Ga species
and the best structure accompany with the relatively high
loading amount, the final propane conversion and propylene
selectivity still attain above 17.5% and 92.0% aer 30 h propane
dehydrogenation reaction at 620 C.
