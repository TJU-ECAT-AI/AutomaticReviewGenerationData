The growing demand for propylene has led to increased interest in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) as a production method. The forecast of 4.8% CAGR in global propylene demand from 2013 to 2018 has driven the development of new PDH processes and catalysts.

The understanding of Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts for PDH has evolved, but there are still ongoing debates about the active Ga species. Research has shown that both supported and bulk Ga2O3 exhibit promising catalytic performance for PDH. However, the nature of the active site in Ga2O3 remains unclear due to its structural complexity and the presence of multiple polymorphs in mixed oxide materials.

Recent research has contributed to our current knowledge of these catalysts by proposing a reaction mechanism involving heterolytic dissociation. In this mechanism, H- adsorbs on a Ga+ site to form a gallium hydride, while a C3H7+ carbocation bonds with a neighboring O atom to create a gallium alkoxide. This finding has helped to advance our understanding of how Ga-based catalysts function in PDH reactions.

Despite these advancements, there is still ongoing debate and research needed to fully elucidate the active Ga species and optimize the performance of Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts for PDH.

丙烯需求的增长推动了新生产方法的发展，特别是丙烷脱氢(PDH)技术。2013年至2018年间全球丙烯需求预计年复合增长率为4.8%，这促使了新PDH工艺和催化剂的开发。

对Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂在PDH中的理解不断深入，但关于活性Ga物种的争论仍在继续。研究表明，负载型和块体Ga2O3都表现出良好的PDH催化性能。然而，由于Ga2O3结构复杂，且在混合氧化物材料中存在多种多形体，其活性位点的本质仍不清楚。

最新研究提出了一种涉及异裂解离的反应机理，为我们对这些催化剂的认知做出了贡献。在该机理中，H-吸附在Ga+位点上形成氢化镓，而C3H7+碳正离子与相邻的O原子结合形成镓烷氧化物。这一发现有助于提高我们对Ga基催化剂在PDH反应中作用机理的理解。

尽管取得了这些进展，但仍需要进行更多研究来完全阐明活性Ga物种的性质，并优化Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂在PDH反应中的性能。
