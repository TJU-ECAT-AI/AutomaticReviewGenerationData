The growing demand for propylene has driven the development of new production methods, particularly propane dehydrogenation (PDH). The forecast of global propylene demand growing at a CAGR of 4.8% from 2013 to 2018 has spurred interest in more efficient production methods.

In response to this demand, research into PDH catalysts has intensified, with a focus on group IIIA metal oxides. Ga2O3-based catalysts, both supported and bulk, have shown promising performance for propane dehydrogenation. However, the understanding of these catalysts is still evolving.

The nature of the active site in Ga2O3 remains unclear, partly due to its structural complexity and the presence of multiple polymorphs in mixed oxide materials. This uncertainty has led to ongoing debates about the active Ga species in these catalysts.

Recent research has contributed to our current knowledge by proposing a reaction mechanism involving heterolytic dissociation. In this mechanism, H- adsorbs on a Ga+ site to form a gallium hydride, while a C3H7+ carbocation bonds with a neighboring O atom to create a gallium alkoxide. This proposed mechanism provides insight into how these catalysts might function, but the debate about the exact nature of the active sites continues.

The ongoing research into Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts for PDH reflects the importance of developing more efficient and selective catalysts to meet the growing demand for propylene. While progress has been made in understanding these catalysts, there are still many questions to be answered, driving further research in this field.

丙烯需求的增长推动了新生产方法的发展，特别是丙烷脱氢(PDH)。2013年至2018年全球丙烯需求预计以4.8%的复合年增长率增长，这激发了对更高效生产方法的兴趣。

为了响应这一需求，PDH催化剂的研究已经加强，重点关注IIIA族金属氧化物。基于Ga2O3的催化剂，无论是负载型还是块状，都显示出了promising的丙烷脱氢性能。然而，对这些催化剂的理解仍在不断发展。

Ga2O3中活性位点的本质仍然不清楚，部分原因是其结构复杂性以及混合氧化物材料中存在多种多形体。这种不确定性导致了关于这些催化剂中活性Ga物种的持续争论。

最近的研究通过提出涉及异裂解离的反应机理，为我们当前的知识做出了贡献。在这种机理中，H-吸附在Ga+位点上形成氢化镓，而C3H7+碳正离子与相邻的O原子结合形成镓烷氧化物。这个提议的机理为这些催化剂如何发挥作用提供了见解，但关于活性位点确切性质的争论仍在继续。

对PDH用Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂的持续研究反映了开发更高效和选择性催化剂以满足丙烯不断增长需求的重要性。虽然在理解这些催化剂方面已取得进展，但仍有许多问题有待回答，这推动了该领域的进一步研究。
