The growing demand for propylene has driven the development of new production methods, particularly propane dehydrogenation (PDH). The global propylene demand was projected to grow at a CAGR of 4.8% from 2013 to 2018, necessitating more efficient production methods. PDH has emerged as a promising technique, although it faces challenges due to its endothermic nature and equilibrium limitations.

The understanding of Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts for PDH has evolved over time, with recent attention focused on group IIIA metal oxides, including supported and bulk Ga2O3. These catalysts have shown promising performance for propane dehydrogenation. However, the nature of the active site in Ga2O3 remains unclear, partly due to its structural complexity and the co-existence of several polymorphs in mixed oxide materials.

The ongoing debate about active Ga species continues, with recent research contributing to our current knowledge. A proposed reaction mechanism suggests heterolytic dissociation, where H adsorbs on a Ga+ site (forming a gallium hydride) while a C3H7+ carbocation bonds with a neighboring O atom to form a gallium alkoxide. This mechanism provides insight into how Ga-based catalysts may function in PDH reactions, although further research is needed to fully elucidate the active species and optimize catalyst performance.

丙烯需求的增长推动了新生产方法的发展，特别是丙烷脱氢(PDH)。全球丙烯需求预计从2013年到2018年将以4.8%的年复合增长率增长，这需要更高效的生产方法。PDH作为一种有前景的技术已经出现，尽管由于其吸热性质和平衡限制面临挑战。

对PDH用Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂的理解随时间不断发展，近期关注焦点集中在IIIA族金属氧化物上，包括负载型和块状Ga2O3。这些催化剂在丙烷脱氢方面表现出良好的性能。然而，由于Ga2O3的结构复杂性以及混合氧化物材料中多种多形体的共存，其活性位点的本质仍不清楚。

关于活性Ga物种的争论仍在继续，近期研究为我们当前的认知做出了贡献。一种提出的反应机理涉及异裂解离，其中H吸附在Ga+位点上（形成镓氢化物），而C3H7+碳正离子与相邻的O原子结合形成镓烷氧化物。这一机理为Ga基催化剂在PDH反应中的功能提供了洞见，尽管还需要进一步研究以全面阐明活性物种并优化催化剂性能。
