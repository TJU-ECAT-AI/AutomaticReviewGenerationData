Site Diversity and Mechanism of Metal-Exchanged Zeolite Catalyzed Non-Oxidative Propane Dehydrogenation

1 Introduction
1.1 Background
Propylene is one of the main feedstocks in the chemical industry, used in the production of a great number of chemicals such as polypropylene, acrylonitrile, propylene oxide, and cymene.[1] Propylene is primarily a by-product of steam cracking (SC) and the fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) of naphtha.[2] In 2015, SC and FCC combined accounted for 81% of global propylene production capacity.[3, 4] The annual propylene production capacity in 2019 was about 130 megatons, and the demand is expected to reach 191 megatons by 2030,[5] laying bare a growing gap between the supply and demand of propylene.[6] In addition to SC and FCC, several on-purpose propylene technologies have been developed to increase propylene production including propane dehydrogenation (PDH), olefin metathesis, and methanol-to-propylene. The rapid increase in shale gas production&mdash;with its substantial content of natural gas liquids[6] and thus propane[5]&mdash;has led to increased interest in PDH: it currently accounts for ≈10% of global propylene production.[7]
PDH can be broadly grouped into two categories: non-oxidative and oxidative. In non-oxidative PDH, propane is catalytically dehydrogenated to produce stoichiometric amounts of propylene and hydrogen. It is endothermic (ΔH298Kθ= 124.3 kJ mol−1) and a volume-increasing reaction (C3H8 → C3H6 + H2), and thus is favored at high temperature and low pressure.[8, 9] To achieve significant propylene yields, PDH typically operates at 550&ndash;700 °C. Common side reactions include CC bond cleavage via cracking and hydrogenolysis: C3H8 → CH4 + C2H4 (

= 119.5 kJ mol−1).[9] Non-oxidative PDH typically exhibits good selectivity for propylene (generally >90%), but low propylene yields (typically < 50%) due to the unfavorable thermodynamics and catalyst deactivation are an obstacle to further market penetration.
Oxidants, usually O2, can be co-fed with propane to enhance the thermodynamic driving force in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) process. This process is exothermic (

= −117 kJ mol−1) and thus the conversion of propane is no longer limited by thermodynamics. In addition, coke formation is inhibited by the presence of a strong oxidant, leading to better catalyst stability. Deep oxidation of propane to CO and CO2 is the main challenge in catalyst design for the ODHP process.[5] Vanadium-based materials have been the most extensively investigated catalysts in ODHP,[5] but B, Co, Cr, Fe, and Ni-based materials have also been explored.[5, 10-12] For example, hexagonal boron nitride achieves 79% propylene selectivity at 490 °C with C3H8:O2 = 2:1 (14% propane conversion).[11] Most recently, Yan et al. reported that In2O3-Pt/Al2O3 catalyst achieves ≈22% propylene yield at 450 °C with C3H8:O2 = 2:1 (32% propane conversion and 70% propylene selectivity).[13] To the authors' knowledge, no ODHP process with O2 has been commercialized, mainly due to its low selectivity for propylene.[14]
Milder oxidants have also been investigated. CO2-assisted ODHP (CO2-ODHP, C3H8 + CO2 → C3H6 + CO + H2O) could, in theory, improve the thermodynamics of PDH.[5] CO2 has two advantages: i) consumes H2 through the reverse water-gas-shift reaction (RWGS: CO2 + H2→ CO + H2O) increasing the equilibrium conversion of propane; ii) CO2 can remove coke via the reverse Boudouard reaction (CO2 + C→ 2CO).[5] However, the presence of CO2 introduces the dry reforming of propane (C3H8 + 3CO2 → 6CO + 4H2) as a competing reaction.[5, 15, 16] Although several key technical hurdles, such as selectivity control at high propane conversions and catalyst stability, have yet to be overcome,[17] CO2-ODHP is promising not only as a carbon-negative technology in the context of the circular economy,[5] but also provides a method of CO2 hydrogenation[18] using the shale-gas derived hydrogen.[19] More catalyst and process development are needed to increase the propylene yield to make this approach commercially viable. There are several reviews that compare non-oxidative PDH and ODPH processes,[5, 8, 9, 16, 19-22] and the rest of this article will focus on the catalyst development in non-oxidative PDH.
1.2 Commercial Catalysts
Several PDH processes have been commercialized including Catofin, Olefex, STAR, PDH, ADHO, K-PROTM, FBD-4, and FCDh.[9] Among these, the Catofin and the Oleflex processes are more widely deployed.[23] The Catofin process employs fixed-bed reactors with CrOx/Al2O3 catalysts containing more than 18% CrOx as the active ingredient and 1&ndash;2 wt% alkaline metals as promoters. It achieves propylene selectivities above 87% at 650 °C and 0.5 bar of propane. The Oleflex process employs fluidized bed reactors with Pt-based catalysts, with propane conversion and propylene selectivity of 30&ndash;40% and 85.5&ndash;88%, respectively.[8, 9] As synthesized CrOx-based catalysts contain multiple oxidation states of Cr, including VI, IV, III, and II, but Cr3+ becomes the main species at reaction conditions.[24] Coordinatively unsaturated Cr3+ has been proposed as the active site for PDH, with the reaction proceeding as follows: i) the adsorption of C3H8; ii) heterolytic dissociation of CH bond to form a Cr-C3H7 intermediate; iii) β-H elimination of Cr-C3H7 intermediate to form Cr3+-C3H6 and H− species; iv) propylene desorption and the formation of Cr-H species; and v) desorption of H2 via proton transfer.[5] The cleavage of the CH bond of propane was proposed as the likely rate-determining step (RDS).[25] CrOx/Al2O3 catalysts deactivate quickly due to coke formation and aggregation of Cr3+ species, which can be mitigated using promoters such as Ce,[26] Ni,[27] and Zr.[28]
Pt-based catalysts exhibit superior ability in activating CH bonds in alkanes and low activity for CC cracking and coke formation. Compared with other catalysts, Pt-based catalysts show the highest turnover frequency (TOF) in PDH (Table 1). TOF normalized by Pt, or TOFPt, varies substantially with the support, the alloying metal, and the catalyst preparation method. The best-reported TOFPt is more than 1000 times higher than that of TOFCr (Table 1). Propylene selectivity is high on Pt-based catalysts (94&ndash;99%). The most accepted mechanism for Pt-based catalysts is the Horiuti&ndash;Polanyi mechanism&mdash;first proposed in 1934&mdash;involving: i) cleavage of the first CH bond in C3H8; ii) activation of the second CH bond in C3H7; iii) formation of a dihydrogen molecule; iv) desorption of hydrogen and propylene.[5, 29] The first CH cleavage is considered the RDS.[30, 31] Side reactions, such as hydrogenolysis, occur near the adsorbed hydrogen, which is favored on large Pt particles. Addition of a second metal to form bimetallic (intermetallic PtM, PtM alloy, or PtMOx clusters, M = metal) catalysts, such as PtSn,[32-34] PtGa,[35-38] PtZn,[30, 39-41] PtCu,[42], and PtCo,[43] can reduce the particle size of Pt, thereby improving the catalytic activity and inhibiting coke formation. Further information is available in these sources.[5, 8, 14, 44-46]

1.3 Metal-Containing Zeolite Catalysts
The high cost of Pt, as well as human health and environmental concerns associated with Cr, have incentivized the development of alternative PDH catalysts[8] such as Ga-,[57, 74-79] Zn-,[62, 80, 81] Co-,[70, 71, 82] V-,[66, 83] Fe-,[72, 84-86] Zr-,[87-89] Sn-,[90] and In-based catalysts[91, 92] and nanocarbon materials.[93] Among these, single-site (Ga+, Zn2+, Co2+, Fe2+, etc.) supported on silica or zeolites[94-96] have shown particular promise. For Ga-based catalysts, different supports, such as SiO2, Al2O3, SBA-15, MFI, and H-ZSM-5, have been used to prepare Ga-based catalysts, achieving TOFGa between 8 and 2120 h−1 (Table 1). Notably, Ga2O22+ sites in H-ZSM-5 exhibit TOFGa at least one order of magnitude higher than other Ga-based catalysts. Zn- and Co-based catalysts show moderate levels of catalytic activity (TOF between 5 and 500 h−1), while Co-related catalysts show a higher propylene selectivity (>95%) than Zn-based catalysts (≈90%). V-based catalysts show TOF between 16 and 216 h−1, and propylene selectivity between 90% and 98%. Fe-based catalysts are slightly less active in comparison. Aside from the Pt-based catalysts, Ga2O22+ stabilized in H-ZSM-5 appears promising, achieving a significantly higher TOF than Ga+ in Ga/H-ZSM-5,[54, 55] Zn2+ in Zn/H-ZSM-5,[60] Ga+ in Ga-CHA,[56] and In+ in In-CHA[92] (Figure 1). Although it is still more than ten times lower than that of Pt-based catalysts, the marked difference in the cost of the two metals makes the Ga-based catalyst a promising alternative.
Metal cation exchanged zeolite catalysts (Ga/H-ZSM-5, Zn/H-ZSM-5, Co/H-ZSM-5) are efficient catalysts for PDH with ≈90% propylene selectivity.[54, 60, 97] As shown in Figure 2, metal cations exchanged zeolites are prepared by replacing Brønsted acid sites (BAS) with metal cations via liquid phase ion-exchange, reductive solid-state ion-exchange (RSSIE), or vapor-phase ion-exchange. Metal cations entering zeolite matrices via ion exchange (IE) generally exhibit Lewis acidity,[98] and are generally believed to be responsible for catalyzing alkane dehydrogenation.[76, 77, 99] However, identifying the exact structure of active metal species in the zeolite in PDH remains challenging.[76, 77, 100-102]

Ga-based catalysts have a long history in hydrocarbon processing. Gallium oxide was investigated as a cracking catalyst as early as the 1960s.[103] The dehydroaromatization activity of supported gallium oxide (on silica, alumina, and zeolites) was revealed in the patent literature in the 1970s,[104] which led to the development of the Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalyst used in the CYCLAR process for converting propane and butane to aromatics.[105-107] Since the dehydrogenation of hydrocarbons is the first step in dehydroaromatization, the ability of Ga/H-ZSM-5 to dehydrogenate light alkanes to alkenes was well appreciated. Meanwhile, the Ga speciation and the structure of active sites on Ga/H-ZSM-5 in dehydrogenation have remained active topics of discussion since its initial discovery without clear resolution. Different Ga species have been proposed to be the active center of the PDH, that is, Ga+, [GaO]+, [Ga(OH)2]+, [GaOH]2+, [GaH]2+, [GaH2]+, and Ga+−H+ pair.[76, 77, 99, 100, 108, 109] Early studies suggested that Ga+ is the dominant species upon reduction of Ga/H-ZSM-5.[99] However, recent investigations emphasized the importance of the framework Al pair site on the Ga speciation.[76, 77, 100] We combined in situ transmission Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, pulse titration studies, and PDH kinetics to demonstrate that the Ga speciation and their PDH performance are dependent on both Ga/Al ratios and Al distributions of the zeolites.[54, 55, 110] The detailed discussion of Ga speciation and PDH mechanism will be included in the next section.
The ability of Zn/H-ZSM-5 to catalyze alkane dehydrogenation was recognized in the 1980s,[111] and has been widely investigated ever since.[81, 112-114] Similar to Ga/H-ZSM-5, multiple Zn species have been reported in Zn/H-ZSM-5, that is, isolated Zn2+, isolated [ZnOH]+, multinuclear ZnO clusters, and bulk ZnO aggregates.[81, 112-114] Zn/H-ZSM-5 catalysts are typically prepared by the liquid IE method, which leads to the introduction of multi-nuclear ZnO clusters and bulk ZnO, aside from the intended isolated Zn2+ sites.[81] The fact that Ga3+ and Zn2+ are isoelectronic could play a role in their similarity in speciation when exchanged into zeolite pores and PDH activity. Almutairi et al.[81] employed chemical vapor deposition (CVD) to prepare Zn/H-ZSM-5 with all BAS replaced by isolated Zn2+, which turned out to be less active for PDH than the samples prepared by IE and incipient wetness impregnation (IWI) methods. Gong et al.[114] employed atomic layer deposition (ALD) to introduce ZnO to H-ZSM-5 and showed that isolated [ZnOH]+ was the dominant species after the first cycle of ALD. [ZnOH]+ had been proposed to be more active for PDH than bulky ZnO clusters formed after several ALD cycles. Nozik et al.[60] recently employed solid-state ion exchange of ZnCl2 with H-ZSM-5 to prepare Zn/H-ZSM-5 catalyst to investigate the effect of Zn/Al ratios on Zn speciation and PDH rates. Zn2+ was proposed to be the active site in the absence of H2. Those conflicting hypotheses could be caused by the different catalyst preparation methods (IE, IWI, CVD, ALD, or solid-state ion exchange with ZnCl2), leading to the formation of different Zn species in Zn/H-ZSM-5. Bulk ZnO is known to heterolytically cleave H2 even at liquid nitrogen temperature,[115] suggesting the possibility of the ZnO clusters in MFI pores to activate the HH and CH bond.
Indium-based catalysts have also received attention for alkane dehydrogenation. Jones and co-workers[116, 117] investigated In2O3-Ga2O3 and ternary In-Ga-Al mixed oxides as catalysts for PDH. It was found that In(0), formed during the reaction, was the cause of catalyst deactivation. Shimizu and co-workers[91, 118] first reported that In/H-CHA was a stable and selective catalyst for ethane dehydrogenation. They also showed that the CHA zeolite was superior to other zeolite frameworks (BEA, MFI, and MOR) and that Al-rich In/H-CHA zeolite (Si/Al = 6.85) exhibited higher dehydrogenation rates. An isolated [InH2]+ site was proposed as the active center in these catalysts based on FTIR and X-ray absorption fine structure (XAFS) measurements. The identification of [InH2]+ as the active site for ethane dehydrogenation was primarily based on ex situ FTIR spectroscopy and DFT calculations;[91, 118] it should be noted that the spectra used in support of the presence of [InH2]+ were collected at low temperature (below 153 K, after treating with H2 at 773 K) rather than the reaction temperature. Lobo and co-workers[92] recently investigated the In speciation in In-CHA catalysts through the combination of in situ FTIR spectroscopy, pulse titrations, and PDH kinetics. Different from the Ga-CHA catalyst that Ga+ could react with H2 via oxidative addition to form GaHx, the InHx band was not observed on In-CHA catalysts within a wide range of temperatures (50&ndash;550 °C), demonstrating that indium has a weaker metal-hydrogen bond than gallium.[56] It was concluded that isolated In+ sites rather than InHx were the stable active site for PDH, which was independent of the Al distribution. The low intrinsic PDH rate on In+ makes it less likely to be commercially relevant (Figure 1).
This review analyzes the mechanistic understanding of PDH on metal-containing zeolite catalysts. We first focus on the characterization method and determination of active structure in Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalyst, as it is the most active in PDH in this category of catalysts. Then, we discussed the multiple PDH reaction mechanisms in Ga/H-ZSM-5. Finally, we provide perspectives on future directions to address unresolved questions and enable the development of more active and selective PDH catalysts.

The production of propylene, a crucial feedstock for the petrochemical industry, has undergone significant transformations in recent years. Traditionally, propylene was primarily obtained as a byproduct of steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking processes in oil refineries. However, the increasing demand for propylene, coupled with the shift towards lighter feedstocks in many regions, has led to the emergence of on-purpose propylene production methods. Among these, propane dehydrogenation (PDH) has gained considerable attention due to its ability to directly convert propane into propylene. This process has become particularly attractive in regions with abundant and low-cost propane resources. As PDH technology continues to evolve, researchers have focused on developing more efficient and selective catalysts. One area of intense scientific debate and investigation is the use of Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts in PDH reactions. These catalysts have shown promise in terms of propylene selectivity and coke resistance, but questions remain regarding their long-term stability and optimal formulation. The ongoing research and discussions surrounding Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts highlight the dynamic nature of propylene production technology and the continuous efforts to improve efficiency and sustainability in this critical industrial sector.
