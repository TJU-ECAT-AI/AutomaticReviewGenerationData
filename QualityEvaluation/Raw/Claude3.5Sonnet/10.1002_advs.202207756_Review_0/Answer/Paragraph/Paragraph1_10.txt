The production of propylene, a crucial feedstock for the petrochemical industry, has undergone significant transformations in recent years. Traditionally, propylene was primarily obtained as a byproduct of steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking processes in oil refineries. However, the increasing demand for propylene, coupled with the shift towards lighter feedstocks in many regions, has led to the emergence of on-purpose propylene production methods. Among these, propane dehydrogenation (PDH) has gained considerable attention due to its ability to directly convert propane into propylene. This process has become particularly attractive in regions with abundant and low-cost propane resources. As PDH technology continues to evolve, researchers have focused on developing more efficient and selective catalysts. One area of intense scientific debate and investigation is the use of Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts in PDH reactions. These catalysts have shown promise in terms of propylene selectivity and coke resistance, but questions remain regarding their long-term stability and optimal formulation. The ongoing research and discussions surrounding Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts highlight the dynamic nature of propylene production technology and the continuous efforts to improve efficiency and sustainability in this critical industrial sector.
