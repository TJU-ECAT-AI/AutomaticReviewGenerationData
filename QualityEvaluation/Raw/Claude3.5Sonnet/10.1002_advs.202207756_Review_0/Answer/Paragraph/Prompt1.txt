A significant finding is the identification of Lewis(Ga+)-Brønsted acid pairs as the active sites for propane dehydrogenation over Ga/H-ZSM-5. It has been found that increased Lewis acidity facilitates heterolytic C-H bond activation, while Brønsted acidity reduces the activation barrier for the elimination of hydrogen.\n\nThe role of Brønsted acid sites has been further investigated, as they are considered to catalyze undesired reactions such as cracking, dehydrocyclization, and coking.
