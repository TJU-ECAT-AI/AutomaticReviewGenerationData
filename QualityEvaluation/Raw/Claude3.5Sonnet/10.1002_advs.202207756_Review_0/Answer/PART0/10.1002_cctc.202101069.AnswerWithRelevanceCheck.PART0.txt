          [1] "Propylene is a vital and basic building block and used for production of a variety of chemicals such as polypropylene, acrylic acid and acrylonitrile."
          [2] "However, the current production capacity cannot fully meet the rapidly increasing demand."
          [3] "As the hydraulic fracturing technology improves, large volumes of shale gas containing propane can be extracted and direct propane dehydrogenation (PDH) attracts wide attention for propylene production with the advantage of less byproducts."
          [4] "Propylene is generally produced from petroleum-derived steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) process. However, the current production capacity cannot fully meet the rapidly increasing demand."
          [5] "Among Zn, V, Zr, Co and Fe-based catalysts, Zn-based catalysts have received more attention due to its low-cost and environment-friendly properties."

          The growing demand for propylene has significantly influenced the development of new production methods, particularly propane dehydrogenation (PDH). Traditional production methods like petroleum-derived steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) have been unable to meet the rapidly increasing demand for propylene. As a result, PDH has gained attention as an on-purpose strategy for propylene production.

          The development of PDH has been influenced by advances in hydraulic fracturing technology, which has made large volumes of propane-containing shale gas available. PDH offers the advantage of producing fewer byproducts compared to traditional methods.

          While the literature does not specifically discuss the evolution of understanding Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts for PDH or debates about active Ga species, it does mention that various catalysts including Zn, V, Zr, Co, and Fe-based ones have been studied for PDH. Among these, Zn-based catalysts have gained more attention due to their low cost and environmentally friendly properties.

          The provided information does not contain specific details about the ongoing debate about active Ga species or recent research findings that have contributed to our current knowledge of Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts for PDH. The documents focus more on ZnO-based catalysts supported on silicalite-1 (S-1) zeolite for PDH reactions.

          丙烯需求的增长显著影响了新生产方法的发展，特别是丙烷脱氢（PDH）。传统的生产方法，如石油衍生的蒸汽裂解和流化催化裂化（FCC），已经无法满足快速增长的丙烯需求。因此，PDH作为一种有目的的丙烯生产策略引起了广泛关注。

          PDH的发展受到水力压裂技术进步的影响，这项技术使得大量含丙烷的页岩气可以被开采。与传统方法相比，PDH具有产生较少副产品的优势。

          虽然文献中没有具体讨论对Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂在PDH中的理解演变或关于活性Ga物种的争论，但确实提到了包括Zn、V、Zr、Co和Fe基在内的各种催化剂已被研究用于PDH。其中，Zn基催化剂因其低成本和环境友好的特性而受到更多关注。

          所提供的信息不包含关于活性Ga物种的持续争论或最近对Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂在PDH中的应用知识做出贡献的研究发现的具体细节。这些文档更多地关注了以硅铝酸盐-1（S-1）沸石为载体的ZnO基催化剂在PDH反应中的应用。
