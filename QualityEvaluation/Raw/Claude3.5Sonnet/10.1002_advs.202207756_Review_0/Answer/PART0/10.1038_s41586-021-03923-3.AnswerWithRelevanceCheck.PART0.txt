          [1] "Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) to propene is an important alternative to oil-based cracking processes, to produce this industrially important platform chemical"

[2] "The commercial PDH technologies utilizing Cr-containing (refs. 3,4) or Pt-containing (refs. 5,6,7,8) catalysts suffer from the toxicity of Cr(VI) compounds or the need to use ecologically harmful chlorine for catalyst regeneration"

[3] "Here, we introduce a method for preparation of environmentally compatible supported catalysts based on commercial ZnO."

[4] "The developed catalyst reveals about three times higher propene productivity at similar propene selectivity."

          The growing demand for propylene has influenced the development of new production methods, particularly propane dehydrogenation (PDH), which is described as an important alternative to oil-based cracking processes for producing this industrially important platform chemical. 

Current commercial PDH technologies typically use Cr-containing or Pt-containing catalysts, but these have significant drawbacks. Cr(VI) compounds are toxic, and Pt-containing catalysts require ecologically harmful chlorine for regeneration. These environmental and health concerns have driven research into new, more environmentally compatible catalysts.

In response to these challenges, researchers have developed a new method for preparing catalysts based on commercial ZnO. This new catalyst shows promising results, with about three times higher propene productivity compared to existing commercial catalysts, while maintaining similar propene selectivity.

While the literature does not specifically address Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts or the debate about active Ga species, it demonstrates ongoing efforts to improve PDH technology and develop more effective, environmentally friendly catalysts for propylene production. This research is part of the broader trend in developing alternative propylene production methods driven by growing demand and environmental concerns.

          丙烯需求的增长推动了新生产方法的发展，特别是丙烷脱氢（PDH），它被描述为生产这种工业上重要的平台化学品的重要替代油基裂解工艺。

目前的商业PDH技术通常使用含铬或含铂催化剂，但这些催化剂存在显著缺点。Cr(VI)化合物具有毒性，而含铂催化剂需要使用对生态有害的氯进行再生。这些环境和健康问题推动了对新型、更环境兼容催化剂的研究。

为应对这些挑战，研究人员开发了一种基于商业ZnO制备催化剂的新方法。这种新催化剂显示出令人鼓舞的结果，与现有商业催化剂相比，丙烯生产率提高了约三倍，同时保持了类似的丙烯选择性。

虽然文献没有具体讨论Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂或关于活性Ga物种的争论，但它展示了持续改进PDH技术和开发更有效、更环保的丙烯生产催化剂的努力。这项研究是由需求增长和环境问题驱动的开发替代丙烯生产方法的更广泛趋势的一部分。
