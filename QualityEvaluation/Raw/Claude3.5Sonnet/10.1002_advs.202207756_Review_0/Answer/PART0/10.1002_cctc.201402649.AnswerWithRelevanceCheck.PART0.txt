          [1] "The increasing importance of shale gas production as a source of energy has initiated significant changes in the petrochemical industry."

          [2] "As oil prices remain high, naphtha crackers are, therefore, being converted to ethane crackers in the USA for the production of ethylene. As the former installations produce significant amounts of propylene, and the latter do not, this has resulted in a shortage of propylene and consequent increased prices."

          [3] "At these market conditions, the production of propylene by the dehydrogenation of propane has become commercially very attractive, which is highlighted by the announcement of dozens of new installations."

          [4] "Two processes have been applied industrially for the dehydrogenation of propane, namely the Catofin and Oleflex processes. The former uses a CrOx/Al2O3 catalyst in a fixed bed reactor."

          The growing demand for propylene has been influenced by changes in the petrochemical industry, particularly the shift from naphtha crackers to ethane crackers in the USA due to increased shale gas production. This transition has led to a shortage of propylene, as ethane crackers produce less propylene compared to naphtha crackers. As a result, propylene prices have increased, making propane dehydrogenation (PDH) an attractive commercial option for propylene production, leading to the announcement of many new PDH installations.

          The literature mentions that two processes have been applied industrially for propane dehydrogenation: the Catofin and Oleflex processes. The Catofin process uses a CrOx/Al2O3 catalyst in a fixed bed reactor. However, the provided information does not contain any details about Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts for PDH, the ongoing debate about active Ga species, or recent research findings that have contributed to our current knowledge of these catalysts.

          丙烯需求的增长受到石油化工行业变化的影响，特别是由于页岩气生产增加导致美国从石脑油裂解装置向乙烷裂解装置的转变。这种转变导致了丙烯短缺，因为乙烷裂解装置生产的丙烯比石脑油裂解装置少。因此，丙烯价格上涨，使丙烷脱氢（PDH）成为丙烯生产的一个具有吸引力的商业选择，导致许多新的PDH装置的宣布建设。

          文献提到，两种工艺已被工业化应用于丙烷脱氢：Catofin和Oleflex工艺。Catofin工艺在固定床反应器中使用CrOx/Al2O3催化剂。然而，提供的信息不包含任何关于Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂用于PDH的详细信息，也没有提到关于活性Ga物种的持续争论，或者近期研究发现对我们对这些催化剂的当前认知的贡献。
