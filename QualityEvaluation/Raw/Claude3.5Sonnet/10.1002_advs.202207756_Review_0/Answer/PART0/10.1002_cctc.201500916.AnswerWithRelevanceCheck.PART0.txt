          [1] "Propylene is a key building block in the synthesis of a large number of chemicals such as poly(propylene), acrylonitrile, and propylene oxide. The global consumption of propylene reached 90million tons in 2015 and its market is still growing."

          [2] "With the influx of new supplies of light gases in North America owing to hydraulic fracturing and because catalytic dehydrogenation has been demonstrated to be an effective method to produce unsaturated short-chain hydrocarbons on a commercial scale, catalytic propane dehydrogenation (PDH) is attracting significant attention as a means to fill the supply-demand gap."

          The growing demand for propylene has significantly influenced the development of new production methods, particularly propane dehydrogenation (PDH). Global propylene consumption reached 90 million tons in 2015 and continues to grow, creating pressure to find efficient production methods. PDH has gained attention as a means to fill the supply-demand gap, especially with the influx of new light gas supplies in North America due to hydraulic fracturing. PDH has been demonstrated to be an effective method for producing unsaturated short-chain hydrocarbons on a commercial scale.

          However, the provided literature does not contain specific information about the evolution of understanding Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts for PDH, the ongoing debate about active Ga species, or recent research findings contributing to our current knowledge of these catalysts. The focus of the given text is primarily on introducing propylene demand and the potential of PDH as a production method, rather than on specific catalyst developments.

          丙烯需求的增长显著影响了新生产方法的发展，特别是丙烷脱氢（PDH）。2015年全球丙烯消费量达到9000万吨，并持续增长，这创造了寻找高效生产方法的压力。PDH作为填补供需缺口的一种方法受到关注，特别是在北美由于水力压裂而出现新的轻质气体供应的背景下。PDH已被证明是在商业规模上生产不饱和短链烃的有效方法。

          然而，所提供的文献中并不包含关于理解Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂用于PDH的演变、关于活性Ga物种的持续争论或对这些催化剂的当前知识有贡献的最新研究发现的具体信息。给定文本的重点主要是介绍丙烯需求和PDH作为生产方法的潜力，而不是具体的催化剂发展。
