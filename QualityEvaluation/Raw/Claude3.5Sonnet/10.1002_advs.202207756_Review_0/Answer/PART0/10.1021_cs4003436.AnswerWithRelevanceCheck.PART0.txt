          [1] "Refinery propylene is primarily derived from FCC, visbreaking/thermal cracking, and coking. For all of these processes propylene is obtained as a diluted stream in propane. FCC-derived propylene accounts for approximately 30% of the global supply, and this percentage tends to increase as the steam cracking-derived propylene decreases as a result of the growth of ethylene production from ethane-based cracking."

          [2] "In recent years, the production of propene via dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) has grown in view of the availability of low-priced propane in shale gas."

          [3] "The increased availability of natural gas from shale deposits has produced a major shift in the feedstocks used for the production of ethylene in U.S., and consequently it has affected the propylene and butadiene markets. The use of ethane as feedstock for the crackers instead of naphtha results in a tighter supply of C3 and C4 olefins, and it might increase the prices for those chemicals in the future."

          [4] "Traditionally, propylene is produced as a byproduct of steam cracking of naphtha for ethylene production or it is recovered from refinery processes, especially from fluid catalytic cracking (FCC)."

          The growing demand for propylene has significantly influenced the development of new production methods, particularly propane dehydrogenation (PDH). This shift has been driven by changes in the petrochemical industry and feedstock availability. Traditionally, propylene was produced as a byproduct of steam cracking of naphtha for ethylene production or recovered from refinery processes, especially fluid catalytic cracking (FCC). FCC-derived propylene accounts for approximately 30% of the global supply.

          However, the increased availability of natural gas from shale deposits has produced a major shift in feedstocks used for ethylene production, particularly in the U.S. The use of ethane as feedstock for crackers instead of naphtha has resulted in a tighter supply of C3 and C4 olefins, potentially increasing prices for these chemicals in the future. This situation, coupled with the availability of low-priced propane in shale gas, has led to the growth of PDH as an important alternative method for propylene production.

          The literature does not provide specific information about the evolution of understanding Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts for PDH, the ongoing debate about active Ga species, or recent research findings contributing to our current knowledge of these catalysts. Therefore, this part of the question cannot be answered based on the given information.

          丙烯需求的增长显著影响了新生产方法的发展，特别是丙烷脱氢（PDH）。这种转变是由石化行业的变化和原料供应情况驱动的。传统上，丙烯是作为乙烯生产过程中石脑油蒸汽裂解的副产品生产的，或从炼油厂工艺中回收，特别是从流化催化裂化（FCC）中回收。FCC衍生的丙烯约占全球供应量的30%。

          然而，页岩气藏天然气的增加可用性导致了用于乙烯生产的原料发生重大转变，特别是在美国。使用乙烷代替石脑油作为裂解装置的原料导致了C3和C4烯烃供应的紧缩，这可能会在未来推高这些化学品的价格。这种情况，加上页岩气中低价丙烷的可用性，导致PDH作为丙烯生产的重要替代方法得到发展。

          文献中没有提供关于Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂在PDH中的理解演变、活性Ga物种的持续争论，或最近对这些催化剂的当前认知有贡献的研究发现的具体信息。因此，基于给定的信息无法回答问题的这一部分。
