          [1] "Propylene is the basic raw material for the production of acrolein, polypropylene, acetone, acrylonitrile, propylene oxide and other industrial products. Conventional propylene production processes involve fluid catalytic cracking, and steam cracking of naphtha and light diesel. However, with the rapid consumption of fossil energy, traditional propylene production methods can no longer meet the increasing demands."

[2] "PDH technology is considered to be one of the most promising propylene production methods because it is a proprietary method that produces only propylene, not a hybrid product."

[3] "The Dow Chemical Company released a forecast in 2016 that the demand for propylene will grow at an average annual rate of 2% to 3% by 2035, which is expected to exceed production capacity between 2016 and 2035."

[4] "Studies have shown that the active site of Ga2O3 is the Lewis acid site provided by coordinatively unsaturated Ga3+."

[5] "Recently the [GaH]2+ ions together with a basic framework oxygen of the Brnsted-acid site were identified as the active sites in the case of Ga species in ZSM-5 zeolites."

[6] "The active sites for PDH in Ga/H-ZSM-5 with medium quantities of tetrahedral aluminum in the lattice were distinguished to be LewisBrnsted acid pairs."

[7] "The [GaH]2+, together with a basic framework oxygen of the Brnsted-acid site, heterolytically activates a propane CH bond with a very low intrinsic enthalpy barrier of 56 kJ mol1."

          The growing demand for propylene has significantly influenced the development of new production methods, particularly propane dehydrogenation (PDH). Traditional methods like fluid catalytic cracking and steam cracking of naphtha and light diesel have become insufficient due to the rapid consumption of fossil fuels. PDH technology has emerged as a promising alternative because it produces only propylene without byproducts.

The urgency for developing new production methods is underscored by forecasts such as the one from Dow Chemical Company, which predicted propylene demand would grow at an average annual rate of 2% to 3% by 2035, potentially exceeding production capacity.

Regarding Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts for PDH, understanding has evolved significantly, but debates about active Ga species persist. Initially, studies showed that the active sites in Ga2O3 were Lewis acid sites provided by coordinatively unsaturated Ga3+ ions. However, recent research has brought new insights:

1. [GaH]2+ ions, in conjunction with a basic framework oxygen of the Brønsted-acid site, have been identified as active sites in Ga species in ZSM-5 zeolites.

2. In Ga/H-ZSM-5 with medium quantities of tetrahedral aluminum in the lattice, Lewis-Brønsted acid pairs have been distinguished as active sites.

3. The [GaH]2+ species, together with a basic framework oxygen of the Brønsted-acid site, can heterolytically activate propane C-H bonds with a very low energy barrier of 56 kJ/mol.

These findings highlight the complexity of Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts and the importance of the interplay between different species (Ga, H, and framework oxygen) in creating active sites for PDH. The research emphasizes the role of both Lewis and Brønsted acidity in the catalytic process, advancing beyond the initial understanding of simple Ga3+ Lewis acid sites.

          丙烯需求的增长显著影响了新生产方法的发展，特别是丙烷脱氢(PDH)技术。由于化石燃料的快速消耗，传统的生产方法如流化催化裂化和石脑油及轻柴油的蒸汽裂解已变得不足。PDH技术因只生产丙烯而不产生副产品而成为一种有前景的替代方法。

开发新生产方法的紧迫性由一些预测所强调，例如陶氏化学公司的预测，预计到2035年丙烯需求将以平均每年2%至3%的速度增长，可能超过生产能力。

关于Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂在PDH中的应用，尽管理解已经显著进步，但对活性Ga物种的争议仍然存在。最初，研究表明Ga2O3中的活性位点是由配位不饱和的Ga3+离子提供的Lewis酸位点。然而，最近的研究带来了新的见解：

1. 在ZSM-5沸石中，[GaH]2+离子与Brønsted酸位点的碱性骨架氧一起被确定为Ga物种的活性位点。

2. 在含有中等数量四面体铝的Ga/H-ZSM-5中，Lewis-Brønsted酸对被识别为活性位点。

3. [GaH]2+物种与Brønsted酸位点的碱性骨架氧一起，可以以很低的能垒（56 kJ/mol）异裂活化丙烷的C-H键。

这些发现突出了Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂的复杂性，以及不同物种（Ga、H和骨架氧）之间相互作用在创造PDH活性位点中的重要性。研究强调了Lewis酸性和Brønsted酸性在催化过程中的作用，超越了最初对简单Ga3+ Lewis酸位点的理解。
