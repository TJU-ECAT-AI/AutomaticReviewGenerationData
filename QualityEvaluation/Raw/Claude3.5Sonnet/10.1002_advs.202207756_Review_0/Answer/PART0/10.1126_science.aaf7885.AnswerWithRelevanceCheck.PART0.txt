          [1] "While propene is conventionally produced via steam cracking of large hydrocarbons in naphtha, the more recent trend to use shale gas as feeds to steam cracker units greatly increases the availability of low-cost ethene but also results in a gap between demand and supply of propene, as well as other higher olefins (2, 3). This disparity motivates the exploration of on-purpose propene technologies."

          [2] "Despite non-oxidative propane dehydrogenation being the emerging technology used today, ODHP has the potential to improve reaction efficiency over its non-oxidative counterpart because of favorable thermodynamics (exothermic, lower reaction temperatures) and enhanced catalyst stability (prevention of coke deposition on the catalyst surface)."

          The growing demand for propylene has influenced the development of new production methods, particularly on-purpose propene technologies like propane dehydrogenation (PDH). This shift has been driven by changes in feedstock availability, with increased use of shale gas in steam cracking resulting in a gap between propylene supply and demand. While non-oxidative propane dehydrogenation is currently the emerging technology, oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) shows potential for improved efficiency due to favorable thermodynamics (exothermic reactions, lower reaction temperatures) and enhanced catalyst stability (prevention of coke deposition on the catalyst surface).

          The literature does not provide information specifically about Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts for PDH, the debate about active Ga species, or recent research findings related to these catalysts. The focus of the given text is primarily on boron nitride catalysts for ODHP rather than Ga-based catalysts for PDH. Therefore, the part of the question about the evolution of understanding Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts, the debate about active Ga species, and recent research findings cannot be answered based on the given information.

          丙烯需求的增长推动了新生产方法的发展，特别是定向丙烯技术，如丙烷脱氢(PDH)。这种转变是由原料供应的变化驱动的，页岩气在蒸汽裂解中的增加使用导致了丙烯供需之间的差距。虽然非氧化丙烷脱氢目前是新兴技术，但丙烷氧化脱氢(ODHP)由于其有利的热力学特性（放热反应，较低的反应温度）和增强的催化剂稳定性（防止催化剂表面结焦）而显示出提高效率的潜力。

          文献中没有提供关于Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂用于PDH的具体信息，也没有涉及活性Ga物种的争论，或与这些催化剂相关的最新研究发现。给出的文本主要集中在用于ODHP的氮化硼催化剂，而不是用于PDH的Ga基催化剂。因此，基于给定的信息无法回答关于Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂理解的演变、活性Ga物种的争论以及最新研究发现的问题部分。
