[1] "Propylene serves as one of the most significant compounds in the chemical industry. Propane dehydrogenation (PDH), an on purpose propylene production technology is developing."

          [2] "Recently, Lerchers group found that, in Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts, a very low enthalpy barrier of 56 kJ·mol1 in a heterolytically activating propane CH bond was observed on [GaH]2+ together with a basic framework oxygen of the Brnsted-acid site"

          [3] "Comparably, Maeno et al. (45) investigated In-CHA catalysts and they suggested that [InH2]+ ions are the catalytic active sites for PDH reactions, which shows better performance than [GaH]2+ sites."

[1] "Propylene is a key building block in the synthesis of a large number of chemicals such as poly(propylene), acrylonitrile, and propylene oxide. The global consumption of propylene reached 90million tons in 2015 and its market is still growing."

          [2] "With the influx of new supplies of light gases in North America owing to hydraulic fracturing and because catalytic dehydrogenation has been demonstrated to be an effective method to produce unsaturated short-chain hydrocarbons on a commercial scale, catalytic propane dehydrogenation (PDH) is attracting significant attention as a means to fill the supply-demand gap."

[1] "Propene (14) has been extensively used as a building unit for the production of plastics, fibers, and intermediates for the synthesis of fine chemicals. The current method for propene production predominantly relies on the steam cracking of heavy hydrocarbons in naphtha, but production using this method is still far from meeting the demands for propene, 116,000,000 tons in 2020."

          [2] "Recently, shale gas, which contains abundant propane, has been regarded as a promising source for propene to reduce dependence on petroleum. Nonoxidative dehydrogenation of propane has emerged as industrial technologies such as Oleflex by Honeywell UOP and Catofin by ABB Lumus (1, 2, 59) have been developed, but these have insufficient lifetimes because of thermodynamically favorable coke formation and metal sintering, which require frequent catalyst regeneration."

          [3] "By contrast, oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) has substantial advantages regarding exothermic features and hindrance of coke formation but is easily overoxidized to form valueless CO2 (1018), and this remains a challenge for practical applications."

[1] "In recent years, the ever-increasing demand for propylene has driven the rapid application and development of propane dehydrogenation technologies. In particular, in China, it is predicted that the processing capacity of propane dehydrogenation will increase to 30 million t per annum by 2030 from about 7 million t per annum at present."

[2] "Ga-containing MFI catalysts also exhibit high dehydrogenation activity, while the nature of the active sites under reaction conditions as well as the role of Brnsted and Lewis acid sites is still discussed controversially."

[3] "On the surface of Ga/H-MFI existed all the species Ga+, GaOx clusters, [GaO]+, [Ga2O2]2+, [Ga(OH)]2+, [Ga(OH)2]+, [GaH2]+, and [GaH]2+. Among these species, Ga+, monomeric [GaO]+ or dimeric [Ga2O2]2+ cations, and [GaH]2+ have all been proposed to be active for the dehydrogenation of light alkanes."

[4] "From the aspect of the acid sites, Brnsted acid sites are considered to catalyze cracking, dehydrocyclization and coking reactions. In order to modify the acidity caused by the presence of aluminum, aluminum-free gallosilicate MFI without Ga introduction, has been synthesized and evaluated for propane dehydrogenation."

[5] "Lewis(Ga+)-Brnsted acid pairs are identified as the active sites for propane dehydrogenation over Ga/H-ZSM-5. The increased Lewis acidity facilitates heterolytic CH bond activation, and Brnsted acidity reduces the activation barrier for the elimination of hydrogen."

[1] "Gallium dispersed in acid materials can be applied to dehydrogenate alkanes. In combination with the shape-selective properties of a medium-pore zeolite such as ZSM-5, light paraffins can be converted into aromatic hydrocarbons including benzene, toluene and xylenes."

[2] "Despite considerable research efforts in the area of Ga-containing zeolites [311], the exact role of gallium in this mechanism has not been totally elucidated yet, with proposals for its role as dehydrogenation function in a pure bifunctional [36] or concerted mechanism [7] and as a promoter to recombinative hydrogen removal during alkane dehydrogenation on Brnsted acid sites [811] receiving most attention."

[3] "The structure of the active intrazeolite Ga species and their reactivity in oxidative and reductive conditions has not been fully resolved yet, owing to the wide variety of possible structures including bulk Ga2O3 aggregates on the external zeolite surface, small gallium oxide aggregates occluded in the zeolite micropore space, reduced Ga species such as Ga2O and cationic Ga species in oxidized or reduced form."

[4] "In order to prepare better-defined Ga species in medium-pore zeolites we have recently examined the CVD of trimethylgallium (TMG) in HZSM-5 and HMOR [21]. In short, TMG can effectively replace the Brnsted acid protons in HZSM-5, resulting in mononuclear dimethylgallium species."

[1] "Ga species in H-ZSM5 zeolites catalyze rate-limiting dehydrogenation steps during the conversion of alkanes to aromatics."
          [2] "Reduced Ga is present in highly dispersed form without Ga nearest neighbors, probably as a monomeric hydride species coordinated to basic oxygens within zeolite channels."
          [3] "This work illustrates the critical need for in-situ techniques to establish the chemical form of catalytic sites and the misleading conclusions that can arise from the exclusive use of pre- and postreaction characterization to suggest the nature of the catatlytic sites."

[1] "Propylene is one of the main feedstocks in the chemical industry, used in the production of a great number of chemicals such as polypropylene, acrylonitrile, propylene oxide, and cymene."

[2] "The annual propylene production capacity in 2019 was about 130 megatons, and the demand is expected to reach 191 megatons by 2030, laying bare a growing gap between the supply and demand of propylene."

[3] "The rapid increase in shale gas production—with its substantial content of natural gas liquids and thus propane—has led to increased interest in PDH: it currently accounts for 10% of global propylene production."

[4] "Different Ga species have been proposed to be the active center of the PDH, that is, Ga+, [GaO]+, [Ga(OH)2]+, [GaOH]2+, [GaH]2+, [GaH2]+, and Ga+H+ pair."

[5] "We combined in situ transmission Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, pulse titration studies, and PDH kinetics to demonstrate that the Ga speciation and their PDH performance are dependent on both Ga/Al ratios and Al distributions of the zeolites."

[1] "Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) to propene is an important alternative to oil-based cracking processes, to produce this industrially important platform chemical"

[2] "The commercial PDH technologies utilizing Cr-containing (refs. 3,4) or Pt-containing (refs. 5,6,7,8) catalysts suffer from the toxicity of Cr(VI) compounds or the need to use ecologically harmful chlorine for catalyst regeneration"

[3] "Here, we introduce a method for preparation of environmentally compatible supported catalysts based on commercial ZnO."

[4] "The developed catalyst reveals about three times higher propene productivity at similar propene selectivity."

[1] "Propylene is an essential industrial intermediate with a gap between supply and anticipated demand (12)."

          [2] "Nonoxidative propane dehydrogenation (PDH) is endothermic and equilibrium-limited, necessitating high temperatures to achieve commercially viable per-pass yields (13)."

          [3] "Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) has been proposed to overcome equilibrium limitations and avoid thermal cracking but suffers from decreasing selectivity with increasing conversion, giving yields below the PDH equilibrium, in spite of decades of research (12, 14)."

[1] "Refinery propylene is primarily derived from FCC, visbreaking/thermal cracking, and coking. For all of these processes propylene is obtained as a diluted stream in propane. FCC-derived propylene accounts for approximately 30% of the global supply, and this percentage tends to increase as the steam cracking-derived propylene decreases as a result of the growth of ethylene production from ethane-based cracking."

          [2] "In recent years, the production of propene via dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) has grown in view of the availability of low-priced propane in shale gas."

          [3] "The increased availability of natural gas from shale deposits has produced a major shift in the feedstocks used for the production of ethylene in U.S., and consequently it has affected the propylene and butadiene markets. The use of ethane as feedstock for the crackers instead of naphtha results in a tighter supply of C3 and C4 olefins, and it might increase the prices for those chemicals in the future."

          [4] "Traditionally, propylene is produced as a byproduct of steam cracking of naphtha for ethylene production or it is recovered from refinery processes, especially from fluid catalytic cracking (FCC)."

[1] "Propylene plays a central role in the chemical industry infrastructure and it is used for the production of a wide range of chemicals, including polypropylene, acrylonitrile, propylene oxide, and cymene"

[2] "However, there has been a growing gap between the demand and supply of propylene, due to a marked increase in the abundance of natural gas as a feedstock"

[3] "Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) is potentially an effective alternative to producing propylene, and two PDH processes, i.e., the Catofin process with a CrOx/Al2O3 catalyst and the Oleflex process using a Pt-based catalyst, have been commercialized"

[4] "The high cost of Pt and the health and environmental concerns associated with Cr, have incentivized development of other PDH catalysts"

[5] "Among these, Ga/H-ZSM-5 has long been recognized as an efficient catalyst for both dehydrogenation and dehydroaromatization of alkanes (the Cyclar process), however, Ga speciation, the identity of catalytic active sites and the reaction mechanism of the PDH reaction remain topics of active discussion despite decades of research"

[6] "Various experimental techniques including in-situ Ga K edge X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES), ex-situ FTIR and NH3-temperature-programmed desorption (NH3-TPD) have been employed to probe Ga speciation in Ga/H-ZSM-5 and identify the active site in the PDH reaction"

[7] "Hensen and coworkers [27,28] first identified Ga monohydride and dihydride species on reduced Ga/H-ZSM-5 with diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier Transform spectroscopy (DRIFTS), suggesting that these species could play an active role in the PDH."

[8] "Recently, Phadke et al. [9] proposed that single [GaH]2+ sites are the active centers for the PDH reaction, and the catalysts reactivity is independent of Ga/Al ratio."

[9] "Schreiber et al. [10] reported that the Ga+H+ paired sites were more active than single Ga+ sites and the parent H-ZSM-5 catalyst based on a combination of reactivity, quantitative pulse reactions, and DFT calculations."

[10] "The hypothesis of Ga+H+ pair sites and isolated Ga+ species having different reactivities has been put forth in recent investigations by both the Bell and the Lercher groups [911,21], however, the existence of these distinct sites is largely indirect; inferred from reactivity data, indirect experimental characterizations and computational investigations."

[1] "Propane dehydrogenation has emerged as a promising and booming method for direct propylene production."

          [2] "This preview highlights some recent important works that are moving forward the propane dehydrogenation process toward high performance with excellent propane conversion, propylene selectivity, and durability."

[1] "The increasing propylene demand combined with the use of alternative feedstocks such as shale gas has amplified the pressure towards propene production and the development of light alkane dehydrogenation processes."

          [2] "As a result, on-site propane dehydrogenation (PDH) is of particular interest for current and future propylene production."

          [3] "Gallium-based zeolites have already been implemented for the conversion of lightweight alkanes to aromatics and H2, a process proposed to involve a tandem dehydrogenation  aromatization process."

          [4] "Ga2O3 and related materials have also been investigated as catalysts for alkane conversion, specifically PDH due to the high selectivity for propylene."

          [5] "In this regard it is proposed that tetra-coordinate surface sites of Ga2O3 are the active sites for propane dehydrogenation. However, due to the reducibility of Ga2O3, these active sites typically suffer from facile reduction, ultimately resulting in catalyst deactivation."

          [6] "Several computational and experimental studies have aimed at identifying these active sites, which so far remains a topic of debate."

[1] "The increasing importance of shale gas production as a source of energy has initiated significant changes in the petrochemical industry."

          [2] "As oil prices remain high, naphtha crackers are, therefore, being converted to ethane crackers in the USA for the production of ethylene. As the former installations produce significant amounts of propylene, and the latter do not, this has resulted in a shortage of propylene and consequent increased prices."

          [3] "At these market conditions, the production of propylene by the dehydrogenation of propane has become commercially very attractive, which is highlighted by the announcement of dozens of new installations."

          [4] "Two processes have been applied industrially for the dehydrogenation of propane, namely the Catofin and Oleflex processes. The former uses a CrOx/Al2O3 catalyst in a fixed bed reactor."

[1] "Propylene is the basic raw material for the production of acrolein, polypropylene, acetone, acrylonitrile, propylene oxide and other industrial products. Conventional propylene production processes involve fluid catalytic cracking, and steam cracking of naphtha and light diesel. However, with the rapid consumption of fossil energy, traditional propylene production methods can no longer meet the increasing demands."

[2] "PDH technology is considered to be one of the most promising propylene production methods because it is a proprietary method that produces only propylene, not a hybrid product."

[3] "The Dow Chemical Company released a forecast in 2016 that the demand for propylene will grow at an average annual rate of 2% to 3% by 2035, which is expected to exceed production capacity between 2016 and 2035."

[4] "Studies have shown that the active site of Ga2O3 is the Lewis acid site provided by coordinatively unsaturated Ga3+."

[5] "Recently the [GaH]2+ ions together with a basic framework oxygen of the Brnsted-acid site were identified as the active sites in the case of Ga species in ZSM-5 zeolites."

[6] "The active sites for PDH in Ga/H-ZSM-5 with medium quantities of tetrahedral aluminum in the lattice were distinguished to be LewisBrnsted acid pairs."

[7] "The [GaH]2+, together with a basic framework oxygen of the Brnsted-acid site, heterolytically activates a propane CH bond with a very low intrinsic enthalpy barrier of 56 kJ mol1."

[1] "Propylene (C3H6) is a crucial organic feedstock for a large number of chemicals in the petrochemical industry. (1) However, it is currently faced with a serious supply deficit because of the rapid growth in market demand for C3H6 derivatives."

[2] "At present, propylene is mainly produced by steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) of naphtha, light diesel, and other oil byproducts, as well as direct dehydrogenation of propane (DHP)."

[3] "Yet, the dehydrogenation process suffers from two inherent drawbacks: (i) the endothermicity-induced thermodynamic limit for C3H8 conversion that demands high-energy input and (ii) the rapid catalyst deactivation because of coke formation."

[4] "Alternatively, oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) is attractive because of its exothermicity, which makes it free from the thermodynamic restraint at lower temperatures."

[1] "Propylene is one of the most important building blocks for producing a wide variety of chemicals such as propylene oxide, acrylonitrile, and so on. With the consumption of fossil energy, the conventional propylene production process such as naphtha steam cracking can no longer meet the growing demands. The direct propane dehydrogenation (PDH) to produce propylene is thus attracting much attention due to the relatively abundant feedstock and less by-products."

[2] "To date, the Oleflex process with PtSn/Al2O3 catalyst and the Catofin process with Cr/Al2O3 catalyst are the most widely used technologies for the industrial PDH reaction. However, the high cost of Pt and serious pollution issues of Cr(VI) greatly restrict the further development."

[3] "Among developed alternatives, cobalt-based catalysts have attracted much attention due to its efficient CH activation ability and inexpensive, nontoxic characters."

[1] "While propene is conventionally produced via steam cracking of large hydrocarbons in naphtha, the more recent trend to use shale gas as feeds to steam cracker units greatly increases the availability of low-cost ethene but also results in a gap between demand and supply of propene, as well as other higher olefins (2, 3). This disparity motivates the exploration of on-purpose propene technologies."

          [2] "Despite non-oxidative propane dehydrogenation being the emerging technology used today, ODHP has the potential to improve reaction efficiency over its non-oxidative counterpart because of favorable thermodynamics (exothermic, lower reaction temperatures) and enhanced catalyst stability (prevention of coke deposition on the catalyst surface)."

[1] "Propylene is an important feedstock for manufacturing various products such as polypropylene, propylene oxide, acrylonitrile and phenol."

          [2] "With the growing production of shale gas, the low price of propane makes the propane dehydrogenation (PDH) process more commercially attractive for on-purpose propylene production."

          [3] "For the industrial PDH catalysts, the Pt- and CrOx-based catalysts are restricted by their high price tag and highly toxic nature, respectively."

          [4] "The supported vanadium catalysts can serve as an alternate because of its considerable activity, proper propylene selectivity and excellent regeneration performance."

[1] "Propylene is a major raw chemical for the petrochemical industry. In recent years, more attention has been paid to the catalytic dehydrogenation of propane to propylene because the growing demand for propylene is beyond the production capacity of conventional hydrocarbon steam cracking and catalytic cracking processes."

[2] "Currently, many studies are devoted to developing novel and potential catalysts in propane dehydrogenation (PDH), such as ceria-based catalysts, calcined hydrotalcite-supported platinum catalysts, Sn/SiO2 catalysts, Pd-based catalysts, mesoporous carbons, gallium oxide-based catalysts and so on."

[3] "Among these, gallium oxide-based catalysts have been recognized as new promising alkane dehydrogenation materials due to their unique capability to activate hydrocarbon species and excellent catalytic efficiency as compared to conventional Cr2O3- and V2O5-based catalysts."

[4] "The previous studies reported that the gallium oxides (Ga2O3, GaO+) were the most species presented on the catalyst after calcination and were readily reduced during pretreatment with hydrogen. The various gallium species (Ga2O3, GaO+ and Ga+) as active constituents exhibited different performances for light alkane dehydrogenation reaction."

[5] "It is remarkable that the Ga3d banding energy of the gallium species in pure β-Ga2O3 is the same as that in 5Ga2O3/SiO2 catalyst, indicating that using ZSM-5, Al2O3 and SBA-15 supports can strengthen the interaction between Ga species and support."

[1] "Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) is an industrial technology for direct propylene production, which has received extensive attention and realized large-scale application."

          [2] "At present, the commercial Pt/Cr-based catalysts suffer from fast deactivation and inferior stability resulting from active species sintering and coke depositing."

          [3] "To overcome the above problems, several strategies such as the modification of the support and the introduction of additives have been proposed to strengthen the catalytic performance and prolong the robust stability of Pt/Cr-based catalysts."

[1] "Propene, used in the chemical industry for the manufacture of polymers, solvents, dyes, resins, fibers, and drugs is mainly produced from crude oil. In view of finite petroleum reserves but growing demand for this olefin, vast reserves of shale gas consisting predominantly of methane and of lower amounts of ethane and propane1 could provide an economical alternative to crude oil."

          [2] "One way to convert propane to propene is the non-oxidative propane dehydrogenation (PDH), which is a successful example of raw-material change in the chemical industry."

          [3] "Propene production via PDH in 2012 amounted to about 5million metric tons (mmt) from the total 80mmt production. The share is expected to grow because several PDH plants are under construction."

[1] "A change of feedstock from naphtha to light alkanes, due to the emergence of shale gas and the increasing availability of natural gas, has led to an increasing development of on-purpose propane dehydrogenation (PDH) technologies."

          [2] "PDH is an extremely energy-intensive process largely due to the high positive enthalpy of the reactions (DrH = 124 kJ mol1), necessitating high reaction temperatures, which presents grand challenges for alkene selectivity and catalyst stability."

          [3] "To tackle these challenges, the active site isolation strategy has been proved to be effective."

[1] "Propylene is a vital and basic building block and used for production of a variety of chemicals such as polypropylene, acrylic acid and acrylonitrile."
          [2] "However, the current production capacity cannot fully meet the rapidly increasing demand."
          [3] "As the hydraulic fracturing technology improves, large volumes of shale gas containing propane can be extracted and direct propane dehydrogenation (PDH) attracts wide attention for propylene production with the advantage of less byproducts."
          [4] "Propylene is generally produced from petroleum-derived steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) process. However, the current production capacity cannot fully meet the rapidly increasing demand."
          [5] "Among Zn, V, Zr, Co and Fe-based catalysts, Zn-based catalysts have received more attention due to its low-cost and environment-friendly properties."

[1] "Annual propene production was around 130 megatonnes in 20191 and is predicted to increase to 191 megatonnes by 2030. Significantly, the expected growth in propane demand cannot be met by existing processes, which are based on steam-cracking (SC) and fluid catalytic cracking (FCC). Instead, direct or on-purpose processes are being developed to fill the so-called propene gap. The focus of this critical review is on the dehydrogenation of propane."

[2] "Historically, a bifunctional Ga/H-ZSM-5 material has been applied as a catalyst for the commercial process for propane aromatization, developed jointly by UOP and BP as the Cyclar Process."

[3] "As described above, Ga is another non-noble metallic element known to catalyse the dehydrogenation of propane, usually through oxidic, tetrahedrally coordinated Ga3+ species, which are considered to be active sites for CH activation."

[4] "However, several surface gallium species (e.g., Ga2O3, GaO+ and Gan+) can exist and are considered active constituents exhibiting different performance for the DDH reaction. Furthermore, the types of surface Ga species present are dependent on the identity of the support, Ga loading, as well as the preparation method."

[5] "Numerous studies have shown that Ga2O3 dispersed on TiO2, MgO, Al2O3, ZrO2, H-ZSM-5, ZSM-8 and MWW zeolites display distinctly different catalytic properties for alkane dehydrogenation."

[6] "Generally, it is accepted that lowering the surface acidity can further enhance the catalytic performance of a DDH catalyst. The addition of 3-mercaptopropyl-trimethoxysilane (MPS) reduces Brønsted and increases Lewis acid sites in the preparation Ga/MFI catalysts, which resulted in improved performance."

[1] "Total propylene consumption was 83 million tons in 2013 and the global demand is forecast to grow at a CAGR of 4.8% during 2013–2018 [3]."

[2] "Non-oxidative propane dehydrogenation is an endothermic and equilibrium-limited process that requires relatively high temperature and low pressure conditions to obtain a high yield of propylene."

[3] "Recently, PDH catalysts involving group IIIA metal oxides have attracted attention. It has been reported that supported Ga2O3 and bulk Ga2O3 show promising catalytic performance for propane dehydrogenation [39–41]."

[4] "However, the nature of the active site in Ga2O3 is still unclear, in part because of its structural complexity and the co-existence of several polymorphs of Ga2O3 in mixed oxide materials."

[5] "A proposed reaction mechanism involves heterolytic dissociation, in which H– adsorbs on a Ga+ site (gallium hydride) and a C3H7+ carbocation bonds with a neighboring O atom to form a gallium alkoxide [44]."

[1] "Recently, market analysis show that the demand for propylene is outpacing that of ethylene and the current supply cannot match the demand."

          [2] "With on purpose propylene production technologies, such as propane dehydrogenation and metathesis being touted as possible alternatives, the cost associated with these technologies remains less competitive relative to steam crackers and FCC."

          [3] "Global propylene demand trends remain strong, and with the change toward lighter feedstocks in modern steam crackers there will be a growing dependence on the FCC to balance the supply side of the propylene equation."

          [4] "SC alone cannot satisfy the demand for propylene. Therefore, there is need of new technology to produce additional propylene to bridge the gap between supply and demand."

          [5] "It could have been easier to fill the gap by reconfiguring the steam cracker, but the steam cracker does not provide flexibility of operation and it has high energy consumption."

          [6] "Being an essentially non-catalytic and nonselective process SC is energy intensive and catalysts have never been widely used in the pyrolysis section in SC to optimize energy efficiency."

          [7] "The configuration of the FCC process, which involves a circulating fluidized bed with the availability of heat and mass transfer and catalysts regeneration, makes it possible for the FCC to be used for applications that go beyond the upgrading of heavy feed to gasoline."

[1] "Propylene is a key commodity chemical for the manufacture of a wide variety of products such as polypropylene, propylene oxide, acetone, acrylonitrile and acrolein [14]. The increasing global demand of propylene and a large reserve of propane in shale-gas deposits are drawing interests in employing catalytic propane dehydrogenation (PDH) to produce propylene."

          [2] "The commercial PDH processes are based on two kinds of primary technologies, the Oleflex process with PtSn/Al2O3 catalyst and the Catofin process with Cr/Al2O3 catalyst [5]."

          [3] "Development of cost-effective and environmentally friendly catalysts (e.g., Ga-, Zn- or Sn-based candidates) remains as an important catalytic challenge [1224]."

[1] "Since substantial amounts of heavier paraffins, such as propane are obtained from shale gas deposits, there is a vast and growing interest in utilizing propane dehydrogenation (PDH) technologies for the on purpose production of propene."

[2] "Within this context, it is important to mention that there have been five newly announced PDH units in the USA, while 9 to 17PDH units may be built in China."

[3] "Although substantial improvements in catalyst materials (Pt-Sn/Al2O3 for Oleflex and Cr/Al2O3 for CATOFIN) and process conditions have been made for both technologies, challenges related to their activity, stability, and selectivity still have to be overcome."

[4] "Here we present a new family of very stable, active, and selective catalyst materials for the dehydrogenation of propane to propene based on PtGa/Al2O3."

[5] "A few papers have already been published, in which Pt and Ga were combined to produce PDH catalysts, but in these systems Ga is deemed to function as a promoter element, with Pt being the active dehydrogenation element."

[6] "This is in contrast with our current catalyst, in which Pt is present in minute amounts and Ga is the active dehydrogenation element."

[1] "Global demand for propylene is >100 million metric tons per year, with 4% annual growth"
          [2] "Nonoxidative propane dehydrogenation (PDH) produced 13.6 million metric tons of propylene in 2019, accounting for 11% of global propylene production"
          [3] "Shale gas production has led to a switch in the industrial feedstocks for propylene, from naphtha to propane"
          [4] "We developed a PDH catalyst that operates at thermodynamically limited conversion levels without the addition of hydrogen to the feed and exhibits excellent stability and selectivity to propylene (>99%)."
          [5] "Commercial PDH processes utilize either chromium (Cr)based (Catofin process) or platinum (Pt)based catalysts [Oleflex and steam-activated reforming (STAR) processes]"

[1] "As global demand for hydrocarbon reserves has continued to increase, more efficient utilization of these resources has become an important and complementary strategy to the development and deployment of sustainable energy generation."

[2] "Currently, olefins are produced by thermal cracking (1) or by catalytic dehydrogenation of alkanes using supported Pt metal or Cr oxide (2) catalysts. Both processes operate at high temperatures above 450 C, where thermodynamics favors high olefin yields."

[3] "Alternatively, single-site Zn(II) ions in MFI zeolite have often been suggested to catalyze alkane dehydrogenation during conversion of propane to aromatics. (5) Although Zn(II) and Ga(III) (6) ions improve the catalyst performance, Brnsted sites in these catalysts also promote these same reactions. (7)"

[4] "In addition, because the initially formed olefins rapidly react at the Brnsted sites, undergoing oligomerization, isomerization, cracking, and aromatization, it has not been possible to demonstrate the independent catalytic function of these exchanged cations. Attempts have been made to neutralize the acid sites, but residual protons contribute significantly to the observed catalysis. (5a)"

[1] "The increasing world demand for propylene and the current low cost of propane derived from shale gas have renewed interest in the propane dehydrogenation reaction (PDH)."

[2] "Ga/H-ZSM-5 exhibits high stability and high propylene selectivity (90%) for propane dehydrogenation."

[3] "Bell and coworkers32 believe that single [GaH]2+ sites are the active species; however, Schreiber et al.31 reported that Ga+H+ pair sites are the stable active sites, a model supported by results from our laboratory."

[4] "Phadke et al.32,37 have pointed out that Ga-exchanged species associated with Al-pairs in Ga/H-MFI catalyze both propane and butane dehydrogenation while isolated Ga species did not."

[5] "Many other catalysts for PDH have been investigated including Ga-,210 Zn-,11,12 Co-,1315 Fe-,1618 V-,1922 Zr-based materials,2325 and nanocarbon catalysts.26,27 Metal cations (Ga+, Zn2+, Co2+, etc.) exchanged in zeolite H-ZSM-52832 have shown promising alkane dehydrogenation properties as well:"

[1] "The demand of these building blocks has increased steadily over the last years, all major markets registering a positive growth in demand and production in recent years with the exception of the Eurozone, due to the effects of the recent economic downturn."

[2] "Consequently, the recent boom in shale gas production has turned the United States into the lowest cost chemical producer outside the Middle East, as illustrated by the 126 investment projects totaling 84 billion dollars made up to September 2013 that have been tallied by the American Chemistry Council."

[3] "As of this writing, ca. 5 million tons of propylene is produced annually by propane dehydrogenation (PDH). However, this number is expected to increase significantly in the upcoming years as dozens of new PDH installations have been announced worldwide, and many of these installations are already under construction."

[4] "The exact nature of the active sites in Ga-based dehydrogenation catalysts is still under debate."

[5] "β-Ga2O3 has a monoclinic structure, in which gallium atoms are equally distributed between tetrahedral and octahedral configurations. This crystal structure has a high concentration of weak Lewis acid sites (coordinatively unsaturated tetrahedral ones on the surface of the material), which are deemed to be centers of dehydrogenation activity."

[6] "Several authors have performed DFT calculations in an effort to understand the dehydrogenation reaction mechanism on Ga2O3."

[7] "Murata and co-workers have observed an increase in activity after a prereduction step with hydrogen at 550 C, while a simultaneous increase of Gaδ+H and GaOH sites was observed via NH3 TPD. These authors proposed that these sites also form during reaction and may be responsible for the dehydrogenation activity of the silica supported Ga2O3 catalyst."

[8] "Chen et al., who, by relating the results of NH3-TPD measurements with activity data for different GaxAl10xO15 mixed oxides, showed that a high concentration of Lewis acid groups in the form of coordinatively unsaturated tetrahedral Ga3+ cations is a prerequisite for dehydrogenation activity"

[1] "Propylene serves as one of the most significant compounds in the chemical industry. Propane dehydrogenation (PDH), an on purpose propylene production technology is developing."

          [2] "Recently, Lerchers group found that, in Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts, a very low enthalpy barrier of 56 kJ·mol1 in a heterolytically activating propane CH bond was observed on [GaH]2+ together with a basic framework oxygen of the Brnsted-acid site"

          [3] "Comparably, Maeno et al. (45) investigated In-CHA catalysts and they suggested that [InH2]+ ions are the catalytic active sites for PDH reactions, which shows better performance than [GaH]2+ sites."

[1] "Propylene is a key building block in the synthesis of a large number of chemicals such as poly(propylene), acrylonitrile, and propylene oxide. The global consumption of propylene reached 90million tons in 2015 and its market is still growing."

          [2] "With the influx of new supplies of light gases in North America owing to hydraulic fracturing and because catalytic dehydrogenation has been demonstrated to be an effective method to produce unsaturated short-chain hydrocarbons on a commercial scale, catalytic propane dehydrogenation (PDH) is attracting significant attention as a means to fill the supply-demand gap."

[1] "Propene (14) has been extensively used as a building unit for the production of plastics, fibers, and intermediates for the synthesis of fine chemicals. The current method for propene production predominantly relies on the steam cracking of heavy hydrocarbons in naphtha, but production using this method is still far from meeting the demands for propene, 116,000,000 tons in 2020."

          [2] "Recently, shale gas, which contains abundant propane, has been regarded as a promising source for propene to reduce dependence on petroleum. Nonoxidative dehydrogenation of propane has emerged as industrial technologies such as Oleflex by Honeywell UOP and Catofin by ABB Lumus (1, 2, 59) have been developed, but these have insufficient lifetimes because of thermodynamically favorable coke formation and metal sintering, which require frequent catalyst regeneration."

          [3] "By contrast, oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) has substantial advantages regarding exothermic features and hindrance of coke formation but is easily overoxidized to form valueless CO2 (1018), and this remains a challenge for practical applications."

[1] "In recent years, the ever-increasing demand for propylene has driven the rapid application and development of propane dehydrogenation technologies. In particular, in China, it is predicted that the processing capacity of propane dehydrogenation will increase to 30 million t per annum by 2030 from about 7 million t per annum at present."

[2] "Ga-containing MFI catalysts also exhibit high dehydrogenation activity, while the nature of the active sites under reaction conditions as well as the role of Brnsted and Lewis acid sites is still discussed controversially."

[3] "On the surface of Ga/H-MFI existed all the species Ga+, GaOx clusters, [GaO]+, [Ga2O2]2+, [Ga(OH)]2+, [Ga(OH)2]+, [GaH2]+, and [GaH]2+. Among these species, Ga+, monomeric [GaO]+ or dimeric [Ga2O2]2+ cations, and [GaH]2+ have all been proposed to be active for the dehydrogenation of light alkanes."

[4] "From the aspect of the acid sites, Brnsted acid sites are considered to catalyze cracking, dehydrocyclization and coking reactions. In order to modify the acidity caused by the presence of aluminum, aluminum-free gallosilicate MFI without Ga introduction, has been synthesized and evaluated for propane dehydrogenation."

[5] "Lewis(Ga+)-Brnsted acid pairs are identified as the active sites for propane dehydrogenation over Ga/H-ZSM-5. The increased Lewis acidity facilitates heterolytic CH bond activation, and Brnsted acidity reduces the activation barrier for the elimination of hydrogen."

[1] "Gallium dispersed in acid materials can be applied to dehydrogenate alkanes. In combination with the shape-selective properties of a medium-pore zeolite such as ZSM-5, light paraffins can be converted into aromatic hydrocarbons including benzene, toluene and xylenes."

[2] "Despite considerable research efforts in the area of Ga-containing zeolites [311], the exact role of gallium in this mechanism has not been totally elucidated yet, with proposals for its role as dehydrogenation function in a pure bifunctional [36] or concerted mechanism [7] and as a promoter to recombinative hydrogen removal during alkane dehydrogenation on Brnsted acid sites [811] receiving most attention."

[3] "The structure of the active intrazeolite Ga species and their reactivity in oxidative and reductive conditions has not been fully resolved yet, owing to the wide variety of possible structures including bulk Ga2O3 aggregates on the external zeolite surface, small gallium oxide aggregates occluded in the zeolite micropore space, reduced Ga species such as Ga2O and cationic Ga species in oxidized or reduced form."

[4] "In order to prepare better-defined Ga species in medium-pore zeolites we have recently examined the CVD of trimethylgallium (TMG) in HZSM-5 and HMOR [21]. In short, TMG can effectively replace the Brnsted acid protons in HZSM-5, resulting in mononuclear dimethylgallium species."

[1] "Ga species in H-ZSM5 zeolites catalyze rate-limiting dehydrogenation steps during the conversion of alkanes to aromatics."
          [2] "Reduced Ga is present in highly dispersed form without Ga nearest neighbors, probably as a monomeric hydride species coordinated to basic oxygens within zeolite channels."
          [3] "This work illustrates the critical need for in-situ techniques to establish the chemical form of catalytic sites and the misleading conclusions that can arise from the exclusive use of pre- and postreaction characterization to suggest the nature of the catatlytic sites."

[1] "Propylene is one of the main feedstocks in the chemical industry, used in the production of a great number of chemicals such as polypropylene, acrylonitrile, propylene oxide, and cymene."

[2] "The annual propylene production capacity in 2019 was about 130 megatons, and the demand is expected to reach 191 megatons by 2030, laying bare a growing gap between the supply and demand of propylene."

[3] "The rapid increase in shale gas production—with its substantial content of natural gas liquids and thus propane—has led to increased interest in PDH: it currently accounts for 10% of global propylene production."

[4] "Different Ga species have been proposed to be the active center of the PDH, that is, Ga+, [GaO]+, [Ga(OH)2]+, [GaOH]2+, [GaH]2+, [GaH2]+, and Ga+H+ pair."

[5] "We combined in situ transmission Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, pulse titration studies, and PDH kinetics to demonstrate that the Ga speciation and their PDH performance are dependent on both Ga/Al ratios and Al distributions of the zeolites."

[1] "Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) to propene is an important alternative to oil-based cracking processes, to produce this industrially important platform chemical"

[2] "The commercial PDH technologies utilizing Cr-containing (refs. 3,4) or Pt-containing (refs. 5,6,7,8) catalysts suffer from the toxicity of Cr(VI) compounds or the need to use ecologically harmful chlorine for catalyst regeneration"

[3] "Here, we introduce a method for preparation of environmentally compatible supported catalysts based on commercial ZnO."

[4] "The developed catalyst reveals about three times higher propene productivity at similar propene selectivity."

[1] "Propylene is an essential industrial intermediate with a gap between supply and anticipated demand (12)."

          [2] "Nonoxidative propane dehydrogenation (PDH) is endothermic and equilibrium-limited, necessitating high temperatures to achieve commercially viable per-pass yields (13)."

          [3] "Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) has been proposed to overcome equilibrium limitations and avoid thermal cracking but suffers from decreasing selectivity with increasing conversion, giving yields below the PDH equilibrium, in spite of decades of research (12, 14)."

[1] "Refinery propylene is primarily derived from FCC, visbreaking/thermal cracking, and coking. For all of these processes propylene is obtained as a diluted stream in propane. FCC-derived propylene accounts for approximately 30% of the global supply, and this percentage tends to increase as the steam cracking-derived propylene decreases as a result of the growth of ethylene production from ethane-based cracking."

          [2] "In recent years, the production of propene via dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) has grown in view of the availability of low-priced propane in shale gas."

          [3] "The increased availability of natural gas from shale deposits has produced a major shift in the feedstocks used for the production of ethylene in U.S., and consequently it has affected the propylene and butadiene markets. The use of ethane as feedstock for the crackers instead of naphtha results in a tighter supply of C3 and C4 olefins, and it might increase the prices for those chemicals in the future."

          [4] "Traditionally, propylene is produced as a byproduct of steam cracking of naphtha for ethylene production or it is recovered from refinery processes, especially from fluid catalytic cracking (FCC)."

[1] "Propylene plays a central role in the chemical industry infrastructure and it is used for the production of a wide range of chemicals, including polypropylene, acrylonitrile, propylene oxide, and cymene"

[2] "However, there has been a growing gap between the demand and supply of propylene, due to a marked increase in the abundance of natural gas as a feedstock"

[3] "Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) is potentially an effective alternative to producing propylene, and two PDH processes, i.e., the Catofin process with a CrOx/Al2O3 catalyst and the Oleflex process using a Pt-based catalyst, have been commercialized"

[4] "The high cost of Pt and the health and environmental concerns associated with Cr, have incentivized development of other PDH catalysts"

[5] "Among these, Ga/H-ZSM-5 has long been recognized as an efficient catalyst for both dehydrogenation and dehydroaromatization of alkanes (the Cyclar process), however, Ga speciation, the identity of catalytic active sites and the reaction mechanism of the PDH reaction remain topics of active discussion despite decades of research"

[6] "Various experimental techniques including in-situ Ga K edge X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES), ex-situ FTIR and NH3-temperature-programmed desorption (NH3-TPD) have been employed to probe Ga speciation in Ga/H-ZSM-5 and identify the active site in the PDH reaction"

[7] "Hensen and coworkers [27,28] first identified Ga monohydride and dihydride species on reduced Ga/H-ZSM-5 with diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier Transform spectroscopy (DRIFTS), suggesting that these species could play an active role in the PDH."

[8] "Recently, Phadke et al. [9] proposed that single [GaH]2+ sites are the active centers for the PDH reaction, and the catalysts reactivity is independent of Ga/Al ratio."

[9] "Schreiber et al. [10] reported that the Ga+H+ paired sites were more active than single Ga+ sites and the parent H-ZSM-5 catalyst based on a combination of reactivity, quantitative pulse reactions, and DFT calculations."

[10] "The hypothesis of Ga+H+ pair sites and isolated Ga+ species having different reactivities has been put forth in recent investigations by both the Bell and the Lercher groups [911,21], however, the existence of these distinct sites is largely indirect; inferred from reactivity data, indirect experimental characterizations and computational investigations."

[1] "Propane dehydrogenation has emerged as a promising and booming method for direct propylene production."

          [2] "This preview highlights some recent important works that are moving forward the propane dehydrogenation process toward high performance with excellent propane conversion, propylene selectivity, and durability."

[1] "The increasing propylene demand combined with the use of alternative feedstocks such as shale gas has amplified the pressure towards propene production and the development of light alkane dehydrogenation processes."

          [2] "As a result, on-site propane dehydrogenation (PDH) is of particular interest for current and future propylene production."

          [3] "Gallium-based zeolites have already been implemented for the conversion of lightweight alkanes to aromatics and H2, a process proposed to involve a tandem dehydrogenation  aromatization process."

          [4] "Ga2O3 and related materials have also been investigated as catalysts for alkane conversion, specifically PDH due to the high selectivity for propylene."

          [5] "In this regard it is proposed that tetra-coordinate surface sites of Ga2O3 are the active sites for propane dehydrogenation. However, due to the reducibility of Ga2O3, these active sites typically suffer from facile reduction, ultimately resulting in catalyst deactivation."

          [6] "Several computational and experimental studies have aimed at identifying these active sites, which so far remains a topic of debate."

[1] "The increasing importance of shale gas production as a source of energy has initiated significant changes in the petrochemical industry."

          [2] "As oil prices remain high, naphtha crackers are, therefore, being converted to ethane crackers in the USA for the production of ethylene. As the former installations produce significant amounts of propylene, and the latter do not, this has resulted in a shortage of propylene and consequent increased prices."

          [3] "At these market conditions, the production of propylene by the dehydrogenation of propane has become commercially very attractive, which is highlighted by the announcement of dozens of new installations."

          [4] "Two processes have been applied industrially for the dehydrogenation of propane, namely the Catofin and Oleflex processes. The former uses a CrOx/Al2O3 catalyst in a fixed bed reactor."

[1] "Propylene is the basic raw material for the production of acrolein, polypropylene, acetone, acrylonitrile, propylene oxide and other industrial products. Conventional propylene production processes involve fluid catalytic cracking, and steam cracking of naphtha and light diesel. However, with the rapid consumption of fossil energy, traditional propylene production methods can no longer meet the increasing demands."

[2] "PDH technology is considered to be one of the most promising propylene production methods because it is a proprietary method that produces only propylene, not a hybrid product."

[3] "The Dow Chemical Company released a forecast in 2016 that the demand for propylene will grow at an average annual rate of 2% to 3% by 2035, which is expected to exceed production capacity between 2016 and 2035."

[4] "Studies have shown that the active site of Ga2O3 is the Lewis acid site provided by coordinatively unsaturated Ga3+."

[5] "Recently the [GaH]2+ ions together with a basic framework oxygen of the Brnsted-acid site were identified as the active sites in the case of Ga species in ZSM-5 zeolites."

[6] "The active sites for PDH in Ga/H-ZSM-5 with medium quantities of tetrahedral aluminum in the lattice were distinguished to be LewisBrnsted acid pairs."

[7] "The [GaH]2+, together with a basic framework oxygen of the Brnsted-acid site, heterolytically activates a propane CH bond with a very low intrinsic enthalpy barrier of 56 kJ mol1."

[1] "Propylene (C3H6) is a crucial organic feedstock for a large number of chemicals in the petrochemical industry. (1) However, it is currently faced with a serious supply deficit because of the rapid growth in market demand for C3H6 derivatives."

[2] "At present, propylene is mainly produced by steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) of naphtha, light diesel, and other oil byproducts, as well as direct dehydrogenation of propane (DHP)."

[3] "Yet, the dehydrogenation process suffers from two inherent drawbacks: (i) the endothermicity-induced thermodynamic limit for C3H8 conversion that demands high-energy input and (ii) the rapid catalyst deactivation because of coke formation."

[4] "Alternatively, oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) is attractive because of its exothermicity, which makes it free from the thermodynamic restraint at lower temperatures."

[1] "Propylene is one of the most important building blocks for producing a wide variety of chemicals such as propylene oxide, acrylonitrile, and so on. With the consumption of fossil energy, the conventional propylene production process such as naphtha steam cracking can no longer meet the growing demands. The direct propane dehydrogenation (PDH) to produce propylene is thus attracting much attention due to the relatively abundant feedstock and less by-products."

[2] "To date, the Oleflex process with PtSn/Al2O3 catalyst and the Catofin process with Cr/Al2O3 catalyst are the most widely used technologies for the industrial PDH reaction. However, the high cost of Pt and serious pollution issues of Cr(VI) greatly restrict the further development."

[3] "Among developed alternatives, cobalt-based catalysts have attracted much attention due to its efficient CH activation ability and inexpensive, nontoxic characters."

[1] "While propene is conventionally produced via steam cracking of large hydrocarbons in naphtha, the more recent trend to use shale gas as feeds to steam cracker units greatly increases the availability of low-cost ethene but also results in a gap between demand and supply of propene, as well as other higher olefins (2, 3). This disparity motivates the exploration of on-purpose propene technologies."

          [2] "Despite non-oxidative propane dehydrogenation being the emerging technology used today, ODHP has the potential to improve reaction efficiency over its non-oxidative counterpart because of favorable thermodynamics (exothermic, lower reaction temperatures) and enhanced catalyst stability (prevention of coke deposition on the catalyst surface)."

[1] "Propylene is an important feedstock for manufacturing various products such as polypropylene, propylene oxide, acrylonitrile and phenol."

          [2] "With the growing production of shale gas, the low price of propane makes the propane dehydrogenation (PDH) process more commercially attractive for on-purpose propylene production."

          [3] "For the industrial PDH catalysts, the Pt- and CrOx-based catalysts are restricted by their high price tag and highly toxic nature, respectively."

          [4] "The supported vanadium catalysts can serve as an alternate because of its considerable activity, proper propylene selectivity and excellent regeneration performance."

[1] "Propylene is a major raw chemical for the petrochemical industry. In recent years, more attention has been paid to the catalytic dehydrogenation of propane to propylene because the growing demand for propylene is beyond the production capacity of conventional hydrocarbon steam cracking and catalytic cracking processes."

[2] "Currently, many studies are devoted to developing novel and potential catalysts in propane dehydrogenation (PDH), such as ceria-based catalysts, calcined hydrotalcite-supported platinum catalysts, Sn/SiO2 catalysts, Pd-based catalysts, mesoporous carbons, gallium oxide-based catalysts and so on."

[3] "Among these, gallium oxide-based catalysts have been recognized as new promising alkane dehydrogenation materials due to their unique capability to activate hydrocarbon species and excellent catalytic efficiency as compared to conventional Cr2O3- and V2O5-based catalysts."

[4] "The previous studies reported that the gallium oxides (Ga2O3, GaO+) were the most species presented on the catalyst after calcination and were readily reduced during pretreatment with hydrogen. The various gallium species (Ga2O3, GaO+ and Ga+) as active constituents exhibited different performances for light alkane dehydrogenation reaction."

[5] "It is remarkable that the Ga3d banding energy of the gallium species in pure β-Ga2O3 is the same as that in 5Ga2O3/SiO2 catalyst, indicating that using ZSM-5, Al2O3 and SBA-15 supports can strengthen the interaction between Ga species and support."

[1] "Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) is an industrial technology for direct propylene production, which has received extensive attention and realized large-scale application."

          [2] "At present, the commercial Pt/Cr-based catalysts suffer from fast deactivation and inferior stability resulting from active species sintering and coke depositing."

          [3] "To overcome the above problems, several strategies such as the modification of the support and the introduction of additives have been proposed to strengthen the catalytic performance and prolong the robust stability of Pt/Cr-based catalysts."

[1] "Propene, used in the chemical industry for the manufacture of polymers, solvents, dyes, resins, fibers, and drugs is mainly produced from crude oil. In view of finite petroleum reserves but growing demand for this olefin, vast reserves of shale gas consisting predominantly of methane and of lower amounts of ethane and propane1 could provide an economical alternative to crude oil."

          [2] "One way to convert propane to propene is the non-oxidative propane dehydrogenation (PDH), which is a successful example of raw-material change in the chemical industry."

          [3] "Propene production via PDH in 2012 amounted to about 5million metric tons (mmt) from the total 80mmt production. The share is expected to grow because several PDH plants are under construction."

[1] "A change of feedstock from naphtha to light alkanes, due to the emergence of shale gas and the increasing availability of natural gas, has led to an increasing development of on-purpose propane dehydrogenation (PDH) technologies."

          [2] "PDH is an extremely energy-intensive process largely due to the high positive enthalpy of the reactions (DrH = 124 kJ mol1), necessitating high reaction temperatures, which presents grand challenges for alkene selectivity and catalyst stability."

          [3] "To tackle these challenges, the active site isolation strategy has been proved to be effective."

[1] "Propylene is a vital and basic building block and used for production of a variety of chemicals such as polypropylene, acrylic acid and acrylonitrile."
          [2] "However, the current production capacity cannot fully meet the rapidly increasing demand."
          [3] "As the hydraulic fracturing technology improves, large volumes of shale gas containing propane can be extracted and direct propane dehydrogenation (PDH) attracts wide attention for propylene production with the advantage of less byproducts."
          [4] "Propylene is generally produced from petroleum-derived steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) process. However, the current production capacity cannot fully meet the rapidly increasing demand."
          [5] "Among Zn, V, Zr, Co and Fe-based catalysts, Zn-based catalysts have received more attention due to its low-cost and environment-friendly properties."

[1] "Annual propene production was around 130 megatonnes in 20191 and is predicted to increase to 191 megatonnes by 2030. Significantly, the expected growth in propane demand cannot be met by existing processes, which are based on steam-cracking (SC) and fluid catalytic cracking (FCC). Instead, direct or on-purpose processes are being developed to fill the so-called propene gap. The focus of this critical review is on the dehydrogenation of propane."

[2] "Historically, a bifunctional Ga/H-ZSM-5 material has been applied as a catalyst for the commercial process for propane aromatization, developed jointly by UOP and BP as the Cyclar Process."

[3] "As described above, Ga is another non-noble metallic element known to catalyse the dehydrogenation of propane, usually through oxidic, tetrahedrally coordinated Ga3+ species, which are considered to be active sites for CH activation."

[4] "However, several surface gallium species (e.g., Ga2O3, GaO+ and Gan+) can exist and are considered active constituents exhibiting different performance for the DDH reaction. Furthermore, the types of surface Ga species present are dependent on the identity of the support, Ga loading, as well as the preparation method."

[5] "Numerous studies have shown that Ga2O3 dispersed on TiO2, MgO, Al2O3, ZrO2, H-ZSM-5, ZSM-8 and MWW zeolites display distinctly different catalytic properties for alkane dehydrogenation."

[6] "Generally, it is accepted that lowering the surface acidity can further enhance the catalytic performance of a DDH catalyst. The addition of 3-mercaptopropyl-trimethoxysilane (MPS) reduces Brønsted and increases Lewis acid sites in the preparation Ga/MFI catalysts, which resulted in improved performance."

[1] "Total propylene consumption was 83 million tons in 2013 and the global demand is forecast to grow at a CAGR of 4.8% during 2013–2018 [3]."

[2] "Non-oxidative propane dehydrogenation is an endothermic and equilibrium-limited process that requires relatively high temperature and low pressure conditions to obtain a high yield of propylene."

[3] "Recently, PDH catalysts involving group IIIA metal oxides have attracted attention. It has been reported that supported Ga2O3 and bulk Ga2O3 show promising catalytic performance for propane dehydrogenation [39–41]."

[4] "However, the nature of the active site in Ga2O3 is still unclear, in part because of its structural complexity and the co-existence of several polymorphs of Ga2O3 in mixed oxide materials."

[5] "A proposed reaction mechanism involves heterolytic dissociation, in which H– adsorbs on a Ga+ site (gallium hydride) and a C3H7+ carbocation bonds with a neighboring O atom to form a gallium alkoxide [44]."

[1] "Recently, market analysis show that the demand for propylene is outpacing that of ethylene and the current supply cannot match the demand."

          [2] "With on purpose propylene production technologies, such as propane dehydrogenation and metathesis being touted as possible alternatives, the cost associated with these technologies remains less competitive relative to steam crackers and FCC."

          [3] "Global propylene demand trends remain strong, and with the change toward lighter feedstocks in modern steam crackers there will be a growing dependence on the FCC to balance the supply side of the propylene equation."

          [4] "SC alone cannot satisfy the demand for propylene. Therefore, there is need of new technology to produce additional propylene to bridge the gap between supply and demand."

          [5] "It could have been easier to fill the gap by reconfiguring the steam cracker, but the steam cracker does not provide flexibility of operation and it has high energy consumption."

          [6] "Being an essentially non-catalytic and nonselective process SC is energy intensive and catalysts have never been widely used in the pyrolysis section in SC to optimize energy efficiency."

          [7] "The configuration of the FCC process, which involves a circulating fluidized bed with the availability of heat and mass transfer and catalysts regeneration, makes it possible for the FCC to be used for applications that go beyond the upgrading of heavy feed to gasoline."

[1] "Propylene is a key commodity chemical for the manufacture of a wide variety of products such as polypropylene, propylene oxide, acetone, acrylonitrile and acrolein [14]. The increasing global demand of propylene and a large reserve of propane in shale-gas deposits are drawing interests in employing catalytic propane dehydrogenation (PDH) to produce propylene."

          [2] "The commercial PDH processes are based on two kinds of primary technologies, the Oleflex process with PtSn/Al2O3 catalyst and the Catofin process with Cr/Al2O3 catalyst [5]."

          [3] "Development of cost-effective and environmentally friendly catalysts (e.g., Ga-, Zn- or Sn-based candidates) remains as an important catalytic challenge [1224]."

[1] "Since substantial amounts of heavier paraffins, such as propane are obtained from shale gas deposits, there is a vast and growing interest in utilizing propane dehydrogenation (PDH) technologies for the on purpose production of propene."

[2] "Within this context, it is important to mention that there have been five newly announced PDH units in the USA, while 9 to 17PDH units may be built in China."

[3] "Although substantial improvements in catalyst materials (Pt-Sn/Al2O3 for Oleflex and Cr/Al2O3 for CATOFIN) and process conditions have been made for both technologies, challenges related to their activity, stability, and selectivity still have to be overcome."

[4] "Here we present a new family of very stable, active, and selective catalyst materials for the dehydrogenation of propane to propene based on PtGa/Al2O3."

[5] "A few papers have already been published, in which Pt and Ga were combined to produce PDH catalysts, but in these systems Ga is deemed to function as a promoter element, with Pt being the active dehydrogenation element."

[6] "This is in contrast with our current catalyst, in which Pt is present in minute amounts and Ga is the active dehydrogenation element."

[1] "Global demand for propylene is >100 million metric tons per year, with 4% annual growth"
          [2] "Nonoxidative propane dehydrogenation (PDH) produced 13.6 million metric tons of propylene in 2019, accounting for 11% of global propylene production"
          [3] "Shale gas production has led to a switch in the industrial feedstocks for propylene, from naphtha to propane"
          [4] "We developed a PDH catalyst that operates at thermodynamically limited conversion levels without the addition of hydrogen to the feed and exhibits excellent stability and selectivity to propylene (>99%)."
          [5] "Commercial PDH processes utilize either chromium (Cr)based (Catofin process) or platinum (Pt)based catalysts [Oleflex and steam-activated reforming (STAR) processes]"

[1] "As global demand for hydrocarbon reserves has continued to increase, more efficient utilization of these resources has become an important and complementary strategy to the development and deployment of sustainable energy generation."

[2] "Currently, olefins are produced by thermal cracking (1) or by catalytic dehydrogenation of alkanes using supported Pt metal or Cr oxide (2) catalysts. Both processes operate at high temperatures above 450 C, where thermodynamics favors high olefin yields."

[3] "Alternatively, single-site Zn(II) ions in MFI zeolite have often been suggested to catalyze alkane dehydrogenation during conversion of propane to aromatics. (5) Although Zn(II) and Ga(III) (6) ions improve the catalyst performance, Brnsted sites in these catalysts also promote these same reactions. (7)"

[4] "In addition, because the initially formed olefins rapidly react at the Brnsted sites, undergoing oligomerization, isomerization, cracking, and aromatization, it has not been possible to demonstrate the independent catalytic function of these exchanged cations. Attempts have been made to neutralize the acid sites, but residual protons contribute significantly to the observed catalysis. (5a)"

[1] "The increasing world demand for propylene and the current low cost of propane derived from shale gas have renewed interest in the propane dehydrogenation reaction (PDH)."

[2] "Ga/H-ZSM-5 exhibits high stability and high propylene selectivity (90%) for propane dehydrogenation."

[3] "Bell and coworkers32 believe that single [GaH]2+ sites are the active species; however, Schreiber et al.31 reported that Ga+H+ pair sites are the stable active sites, a model supported by results from our laboratory."

[4] "Phadke et al.32,37 have pointed out that Ga-exchanged species associated with Al-pairs in Ga/H-MFI catalyze both propane and butane dehydrogenation while isolated Ga species did not."

[5] "Many other catalysts for PDH have been investigated including Ga-,210 Zn-,11,12 Co-,1315 Fe-,1618 V-,1922 Zr-based materials,2325 and nanocarbon catalysts.26,27 Metal cations (Ga+, Zn2+, Co2+, etc.) exchanged in zeolite H-ZSM-52832 have shown promising alkane dehydrogenation properties as well:"

[1] "The demand of these building blocks has increased steadily over the last years, all major markets registering a positive growth in demand and production in recent years with the exception of the Eurozone, due to the effects of the recent economic downturn."

[2] "Consequently, the recent boom in shale gas production has turned the United States into the lowest cost chemical producer outside the Middle East, as illustrated by the 126 investment projects totaling 84 billion dollars made up to September 2013 that have been tallied by the American Chemistry Council."

[3] "As of this writing, ca. 5 million tons of propylene is produced annually by propane dehydrogenation (PDH). However, this number is expected to increase significantly in the upcoming years as dozens of new PDH installations have been announced worldwide, and many of these installations are already under construction."

[4] "The exact nature of the active sites in Ga-based dehydrogenation catalysts is still under debate."

[5] "β-Ga2O3 has a monoclinic structure, in which gallium atoms are equally distributed between tetrahedral and octahedral configurations. This crystal structure has a high concentration of weak Lewis acid sites (coordinatively unsaturated tetrahedral ones on the surface of the material), which are deemed to be centers of dehydrogenation activity."

[6] "Several authors have performed DFT calculations in an effort to understand the dehydrogenation reaction mechanism on Ga2O3."

[7] "Murata and co-workers have observed an increase in activity after a prereduction step with hydrogen at 550 C, while a simultaneous increase of Gaδ+H and GaOH sites was observed via NH3 TPD. These authors proposed that these sites also form during reaction and may be responsible for the dehydrogenation activity of the silica supported Ga2O3 catalyst."

[8] "Chen et al., who, by relating the results of NH3-TPD measurements with activity data for different GaxAl10xO15 mixed oxides, showed that a high concentration of Lewis acid groups in the form of coordinatively unsaturated tetrahedral Ga3+ cations is a prerequisite for dehydrogenation activity"
