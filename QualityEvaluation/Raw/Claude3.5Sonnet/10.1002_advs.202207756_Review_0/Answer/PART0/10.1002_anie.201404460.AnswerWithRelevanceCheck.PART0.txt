          [1] "Since substantial amounts of heavier paraffins, such as propane are obtained from shale gas deposits, there is a vast and growing interest in utilizing propane dehydrogenation (PDH) technologies for the on purpose production of propene."

[2] "Within this context, it is important to mention that there have been five newly announced PDH units in the USA, while 9 to 17PDH units may be built in China."

[3] "Although substantial improvements in catalyst materials (Pt-Sn/Al2O3 for Oleflex and Cr/Al2O3 for CATOFIN) and process conditions have been made for both technologies, challenges related to their activity, stability, and selectivity still have to be overcome."

[4] "Here we present a new family of very stable, active, and selective catalyst materials for the dehydrogenation of propane to propene based on PtGa/Al2O3."

[5] "A few papers have already been published, in which Pt and Ga were combined to produce PDH catalysts, but in these systems Ga is deemed to function as a promoter element, with Pt being the active dehydrogenation element."

[6] "This is in contrast with our current catalyst, in which Pt is present in minute amounts and Ga is the active dehydrogenation element."

          The growing demand for propylene has significantly influenced the development of new production methods, particularly propane dehydrogenation (PDH). This is evident from the increasing interest in PDH technologies for the purposeful production of propene, especially given the abundance of propane obtained from shale gas deposits. The industry's response to this demand is reflected in the announcement of new PDH units in the USA and China, indicating a global shift towards this production method.

The development of PDH catalysts has been an ongoing process, with substantial improvements made to catalyst materials such as Pt-Sn/Al2O3 for the Oleflex process and Cr/Al2O3 for the CATOFIN process. However, challenges related to activity, stability, and selectivity have persisted, driving continued research and development in this field.

The understanding of Ga-based catalysts for PDH has evolved over time. While previous research focused on Pt-Ga systems where Ga was considered a promoter element and Pt the active dehydrogenation component, recent findings have challenged this view. The current research presents a new family of catalyst materials based on PtGa/Al2O3, where Ga is the active dehydrogenation element and Pt is present in minute amounts.

This shift in understanding highlights the ongoing debate about active Ga species in PDH catalysts. The research contributes to our current knowledge by demonstrating that Ga can be the primary active component in these catalysts, contrary to earlier beliefs. This finding opens up new avenues for catalyst design and optimization in propane dehydrogenation processes.

The evolution of our understanding of these catalysts underscores the complexity of heterogeneous catalysis and the importance of continued research in this field. It also suggests that there may be more to discover about the roles and interactions of different elements in PDH catalysts, which could lead to further improvements in catalyst performance and propylene production efficiency.

          丙烯需求的增长显著影响了新生产方法的发展，特别是丙烷脱氢(PDH)技术。这一点从页岩气中丰富可得的丙烷用于有目的地生产丙烯的PDH技术日益受到关注可以看出。行业对这一需求的回应体现在美国和中国新宣布的PDH装置上，表明PDH产能扩张是一个全球趋势。

PDH催化剂的开发一直是一个持续的过程，Oleflex工艺使用的Pt-Sn/Al2O3催化剂和CATOFIN工艺使用的Cr/Al2O3催化剂都有了实质性改进。然而，与活性、稳定性和选择性相关的挑战仍然存在，这推动了该领域的进一步研究和开发。

对PDH用镓基催化剂的理解随时间而演变。虽然先前的研究集中在Pt-Ga系统上，其中镓被认为是促进元素，而铂是活性脱氢组分，但最近的发现挑战了这一观点。当前的研究提出了一种基于PtGa/Al2O3的新型催化剂材料系列，其中镓是活性脱氢元素，而铂仅以微量存在。

这种理解的转变突出了关于PDH催化剂中活性镓物种的持续争论。该研究通过证明镓可以是这些催化剂中的主要活性组分，对我们当前的知识做出了贡献，这与早期的认知相反。这一发现为丙烷脱氢过程中的催化剂设计和优化开辟了新的途径。

我们对这些催化剂理解的演变凸显了多相催化的复杂性以及在这一领域持续研究的重要性。它还表明，关于PDH催化剂中不同元素的作用和相互作用可能还有更多待发现，这可能会导致催化剂性能和丙烯生产效率的进一步提高。
