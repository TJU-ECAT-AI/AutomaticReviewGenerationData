          [1] "Propylene is an important feedstock for manufacturing various products such as polypropylene, propylene oxide, acrylonitrile and phenol."

          [2] "With the growing production of shale gas, the low price of propane makes the propane dehydrogenation (PDH) process more commercially attractive for on-purpose propylene production."

          [3] "For the industrial PDH catalysts, the Pt- and CrOx-based catalysts are restricted by their high price tag and highly toxic nature, respectively."

          [4] "The supported vanadium catalysts can serve as an alternate because of its considerable activity, proper propylene selectivity and excellent regeneration performance."

          The growing demand for propylene has influenced the development of new production methods, particularly propane dehydrogenation (PDH). This shift is primarily driven by the increased production of shale gas, which has made propane more affordable and PDH more commercially viable for on-purpose propylene production.

          Traditional industrial PDH catalysts, such as those based on Pt and CrOx, have limitations due to their high cost and toxicity. As a result, supported vanadium catalysts have emerged as a promising alternative, offering good activity, propylene selectivity, and regeneration performance.

          However, the provided literature does not contain specific information about Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts for PDH, the ongoing debate about active Ga species, or recent research findings related to these catalysts. The focus of the given text is primarily on vanadium-based catalysts for PDH as an alternative to traditional Pt- and CrOx-based catalysts.

          丙烯需求的增长推动了新生产方法的发展，特别是丙烷脱氢（PDH）。这种转变主要是由页岩气产量的增加所驱动的，这使得丙烷价格更加实惠，PDH在商业上更具可行性，成为有目的生产丙烯的方法。

          传统的工业PDH催化剂，如基于Pt和CrOx的催化剂，由于其高成本和毒性而受到限制。因此，负载型钒催化剂作为一种有前景的替代品出现，具有良好的活性、丙烯选择性和再生性能。

          然而，所提供的文献并不包含关于Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂用于PDH的具体信息，也没有涉及活性Ga物种的持续争论或与这些催化剂相关的最新研究发现。给定文本主要集中在基于钒的PDH催化剂上，作为传统Pt和CrOx基催化剂的替代品。
