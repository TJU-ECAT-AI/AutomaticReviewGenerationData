          [1] "In recent years, the ever-increasing demand for propylene has driven the rapid application and development of propane dehydrogenation technologies. In particular, in China, it is predicted that the processing capacity of propane dehydrogenation will increase to 30 million t per annum by 2030 from about 7 million t per annum at present."

[2] "Ga-containing MFI catalysts also exhibit high dehydrogenation activity, while the nature of the active sites under reaction conditions as well as the role of Brnsted and Lewis acid sites is still discussed controversially."

[3] "On the surface of Ga/H-MFI existed all the species Ga+, GaOx clusters, [GaO]+, [Ga2O2]2+, [Ga(OH)]2+, [Ga(OH)2]+, [GaH2]+, and [GaH]2+. Among these species, Ga+, monomeric [GaO]+ or dimeric [Ga2O2]2+ cations, and [GaH]2+ have all been proposed to be active for the dehydrogenation of light alkanes."

[4] "From the aspect of the acid sites, Brnsted acid sites are considered to catalyze cracking, dehydrocyclization and coking reactions. In order to modify the acidity caused by the presence of aluminum, aluminum-free gallosilicate MFI without Ga introduction, has been synthesized and evaluated for propane dehydrogenation."

[5] "Lewis(Ga+)-Brnsted acid pairs are identified as the active sites for propane dehydrogenation over Ga/H-ZSM-5. The increased Lewis acidity facilitates heterolytic CH bond activation, and Brnsted acidity reduces the activation barrier for the elimination of hydrogen."

          The growing demand for propylene has significantly influenced the development of new production methods, particularly propane dehydrogenation (PDH). This is evidenced by the rapid application and development of PDH technologies in recent years. In China alone, the processing capacity for PDH is expected to increase more than fourfold, from about 7 million tonnes per annum currently to 30 million tonnes per annum by 2030.

The understanding of Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts for PDH has evolved over time, but there is still ongoing debate about the nature of active Ga species and the role of acid sites. Various Ga species have been identified on the surface of Ga/H-MFI catalysts, including Ga+, GaOx clusters, [GaO]+, [Ga2O2]2+, [Ga(OH)]2+, [Ga(OH)2]+, [GaH2]+, and [GaH]2+. Among these, Ga+, monomeric [GaO]+ or dimeric [Ga2O2]2+ cations, and [GaH]2+ have all been proposed as active sites for the dehydrogenation of light alkanes.

Recent research has contributed to our current knowledge of these catalysts. A significant finding is the identification of Lewis(Ga+)-Brønsted acid pairs as the active sites for propane dehydrogenation over Ga/H-ZSM-5. It has been found that increased Lewis acidity facilitates heterolytic C-H bond activation, while Brønsted acidity reduces the activation barrier for the elimination of hydrogen.

The role of Brønsted acid sites has been further investigated, as they are considered to catalyze undesired reactions such as cracking, dehydrocyclization, and coking. To address this issue, researchers have synthesized aluminum-free gallosilicate MFI catalysts without Ga introduction to modify the acidity caused by the presence of aluminum.

Despite these advancements, the precise nature of the active sites under reaction conditions and the roles of Brønsted and Lewis acid sites in Ga-containing MFI catalysts remain subjects of ongoing research and debate in the scientific community.

          丙烯需求的持续增长极大地推动了新生产方法的发展，特别是丙烷脱氢(PDH)技术。这一点从近年来PDH技术的快速应用和发展中可以得到证实。仅在中国，PDH的加工能力预计将从目前的每年约700万吨增加到2030年的每年3000万吨，增长超过四倍。

对于PDH用Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂的理解随时间不断演进，但关于活性Ga物种的本质和酸性位点的作用仍存在争议。在Ga/H-MFI催化剂表面上已经识别出多种Ga物种，包括Ga+、GaOx簇、[GaO]+、[Ga2O2]2+、[Ga(OH)]2+、[Ga(OH)2]+、[GaH2]+和[GaH]2+。其中，Ga+、单体[GaO]+或二聚体[Ga2O2]2+阳离子，以及[GaH]2+都被提出可能是轻烷烃脱氢的活性位点。

近期研究为我们对这些催化剂的认知做出了贡献。一个重要发现是在Ga/H-ZSM-5上识别出Lewis(Ga+)-Brønsted酸对作为丙烷脱氢的活性位点。研究发现，Lewis酸性的增加有助于C-H键的异裂活化，而Brønsted酸性则降低了氢消除的活化能垒。

对Brønsted酸位的作用进行了进一步研究，因为它们被认为会催化裂化、脱氢环化和积碳等不良反应。为解决这个问题，研究人员合成了不含铝的镓硅MFI催化剂（未引入Ga），以改变由铝存在引起的酸性。

尽管取得了这些进展，在实际反应条件下活性位点的确切性质以及Brønsted和Lewis酸位在含Ga的MFI催化剂中的作用仍然是科学界正在研究和争论的话题。
