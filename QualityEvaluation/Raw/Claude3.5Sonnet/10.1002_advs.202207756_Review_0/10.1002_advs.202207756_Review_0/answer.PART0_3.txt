The growing demand for propylene has significantly influenced the development of new production methods, particularly propane dehydrogenation (PDH). The expected increase in propylene demand from 130 megatons in 2019 to 191 megatons by 2030 has created a substantial gap between supply and demand. This gap, coupled with the increased availability of propane from shale gas production, has led to a surge in interest in PDH technology, which now accounts for 10% of global propylene production.

The understanding of Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts for PDH has evolved considerably over time, but there remains an ongoing debate about the active Ga species. Various Ga species have been proposed as the active center for PDH, including Ga+, [GaO]+, [Ga(OH)2]+, [GaOH]2+, [GaH]2+, [GaH2]+, and Ga+H+ pair. This diversity of proposed active species reflects the complexity of the catalyst system and the challenges in definitively identifying the active sites.

Recent research has contributed significantly to our current knowledge of these catalysts. Notably, studies combining in situ transmission Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, pulse titration studies, and PDH kinetics have demonstrated that both Ga speciation and PDH performance are dependent on the Ga/Al ratios and Al distributions within the zeolites. This finding highlights the importance of considering not just the presence of Ga species, but also their interaction with the zeolite structure and composition.

These advancements in understanding have helped to clarify some aspects of Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts, but they have also revealed the complexity of these systems. The ongoing research in this area continues to refine our knowledge of the active sites and mechanisms involved in PDH catalysis, which is crucial for the development of more efficient and selective catalysts to meet the growing demand for propylene.

丙烯需求的增长显著影响了新生产方法的发展，特别是丙烷脱氢(PDH)技术。预计丙烯需求将从2019年的1.3亿吨增加到2030年的1.91亿吨，这造成了供需之间的巨大差距。这一差距，加上页岩气生产带来的丙烷供应增加，导致了对PDH技术兴趣的激增，目前PDH已占全球丙烯生产的10%。

关于Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂在PDH中的理解随时间不断发展，但关于活性Ga物种的争论仍在继续。多种Ga物种被提出可能是PDH的活性中心，包括Ga+、[GaO]+、[Ga(OH)2]+、[GaOH]2+、[GaH]2+、[GaH2]+和Ga+H+对。这些提议的多样性反映了催化剂系统的复杂性以及明确识别活性位点的挑战。

近期研究对我们当前对这些催化剂的认知做出了重大贡献。值得注意的是，结合原位傅里叶变换红外(FTIR)光谱、脉冲滴定研究和PDH动力学的研究表明，Ga物种和PDH性能都依赖于沸石中的Ga/Al比和Al分布。这一发现强调了不仅要考虑Ga物种的存在，还要考虑它们与沸石结构和组成的相互作用的重要性。

这些理解上的进展帮助阐明了Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂的一些方面，但也揭示了这些系统的复杂性。这一领域的持续研究继续完善我们对PDH催化中活性位点和机理的认知，这对于开发更高效和选择性的催化剂以满足日益增长的丙烯需求至关重要。
