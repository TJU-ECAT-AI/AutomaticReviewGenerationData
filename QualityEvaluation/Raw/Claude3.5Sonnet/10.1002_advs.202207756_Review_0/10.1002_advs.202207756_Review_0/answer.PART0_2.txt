[1] "Propylene is one of the main feedstocks in the chemical industry, used in the production of a great number of chemicals such as polypropylene, acrylonitrile, propylene oxide, and cymene."

[2] "The annual propylene production capacity in 2019 was about 130 megatons, and the demand is expected to reach 191 megatons by 2030, laying bare a growing gap between the supply and demand of propylene."

[3] "The rapid increase in shale gas productionwith its substantial content of natural gas liquids and thus propanehas led to increased interest in PDH: it currently accounts for 10% of global propylene production."

[4] "Different Ga species have been proposed to be the active center of the PDH, that is, Ga+, [GaO]+, [Ga(OH)2]+, [GaOH]2+, [GaH]2+, [GaH2]+, and Ga+H+ pair."

[5] "We combined in situ transmission Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, pulse titration studies, and PDH kinetics to demonstrate that the Ga speciation and their PDH performance are dependent on both Ga/Al ratios and Al distributions of the zeolites."

The growing demand for propylene has significantly influenced the development of new production methods, particularly propane dehydrogenation (PDH). This is evidenced by the projected increase in propylene demand from 130 megatons in 2019 to 191 megatons by 2030, highlighting a widening gap between supply and demand. The abundance of propane from shale gas production has made PDH an increasingly attractive option, now accounting for 10% of global propylene production.

The understanding of Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts for PDH has evolved considerably, with ongoing debates about the active Ga species. Over time, various Ga species have been proposed as the active center for PDH, including Ga+, [GaO]+, [Ga(OH)2]+, [GaOH]2+, [GaH]2+, [GaH2]+, and Ga+H+ pair. This diversity of proposed active species reflects the complexity of the catalyst system and the challenges in definitively identifying the active sites.

Recent research has contributed significantly to our current knowledge of these catalysts. Notably, studies combining in situ transmission Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, pulse titration studies, and PDH kinetics have demonstrated that Ga speciation and PDH performance are dependent on both Ga/Al ratios and Al distributions in the zeolites. This finding represents a significant advancement in understanding the nature of active sites in Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts and highlights the importance of considering multiple factors in catalyst design and optimization for PDH processes.

丙烯需求的增长显著影响了新生产方法的发展，特别是丙烷脱氢（PDH）。这一点从2019年丙烯产能130兆吨预计到2030年将增至191兆吨的数据中可以看出，突显了供需之间日益扩大的差距。页岩气生产中丰富的丙烷使PDH成为一个越来越具吸引力的选择，目前占全球丙烯产量的10%。

对Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂在PDH中的理解已经有了相当大的进展，但关于活性Ga物种的争论仍在继续。随着时间的推移，多种Ga物种被提出可能是PDH的活性中心，包括Ga+、[GaO]+、[Ga(OH)2]+、[GaOH]2+、[GaH]2+、[GaH2]+和Ga+H+对。这些提议的活性物种的多样性反映了催化剂系统的复杂性以及在确定活性位点方面所面临的挑战。

近期研究对我们目前对这些催化剂的认知做出了重大贡献。值得注意的是，结合原位傅里叶变换红外（FTIR）光谱、脉冲滴定研究和PDH动力学的研究表明，Ga物种形态和PDH性能既取决于Ga/Al比例，也取决于沸石中Al的分布。这一发现代表了对Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂活性位点性质理解的重大进步，并强调了在PDH过程的催化剂设计和优化中考虑多种因素的重要性。
