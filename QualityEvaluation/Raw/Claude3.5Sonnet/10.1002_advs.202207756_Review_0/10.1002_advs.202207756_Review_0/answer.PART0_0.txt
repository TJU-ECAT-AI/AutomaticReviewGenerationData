The growing demand for propylene has significantly influenced the development of new production methods, particularly propane dehydrogenation (PDH). The expected increase in propylene demand from 130 megatons in 2019 to 191 megatons by 2030 has created a supply-demand gap, driving the need for alternative production methods. PDH has gained increased interest, especially due to the rise in shale gas production, which provides a substantial source of propane. Currently, PDH accounts for 10% of global propylene production.

The understanding of Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts for PDH has evolved considerably over time, with ongoing debate about the active Ga species. Various Ga species have been proposed as the active center for PDH, including Ga+, [GaO]+, [Ga(OH)2]+, [GaOH]2+, [GaH]2+, [GaH2]+, and Ga+H+ pairs. This diversity of proposed active species highlights the complexity of the catalyst system and the challenges in identifying the exact active sites.

Recent research has contributed significantly to our current knowledge of these catalysts. Notably, studies combining in situ transmission Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, pulse titration studies, and PDH kinetics have demonstrated that both Ga/Al ratios and Al distributions in the zeolites play crucial roles in determining Ga speciation and PDH performance. This finding suggests that the active Ga species and their catalytic activity are not solely dependent on the presence of Ga, but also on the structural characteristics of the zeolite support.

These advancements in understanding Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts have important implications for the development of more efficient PDH processes, potentially helping to address the growing demand for propylene in the chemical industry.

丙烯需求的增长显著影响了新生产方法的发展，特别是丙烷脱氢（PDH）。预计丙烯需求将从2019年的1.3亿吨增加到2030年的1.91亿吨，这造成了供需差距，推动了替代生产方法的需求。由于页岩气产量的增加提供了大量的丙烷来源，PDH受到了越来越多的关注。目前，PDH占全球丙烯产量的10%。

对Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂用于PDH的理解已经有了相当大的发展，但关于活性Ga物种的争论仍在持续。多种Ga物种被提议作为PDH的活性中心，包括Ga+、[GaO]+、[Ga(OH)2]+、[GaOH]2+、[GaH]2+、[GaH2]+和Ga+H+对。这种提议的活性物种的多样性突显了催化剂系统的复杂性和确定确切活性位点的挑战。

近期研究对我们目前对这些催化剂的认知做出了重要贡献。值得注意的是，结合原位傅里叶变换红外（FTIR）光谱、脉冲滴定研究和PDH动力学的研究表明，沸石中的Ga/Al比例和Al分布都在决定Ga物种形态和PDH性能方面起着关键作用。这一发现表明，活性Ga物种及其催化活性不仅取决于Ga的存在，还取决于沸石载体的结构特征。

这些对Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂理解的进步对开发更高效的PDH工艺有重要影响，有可能有助于满足化工行业日益增长的丙烯需求。
