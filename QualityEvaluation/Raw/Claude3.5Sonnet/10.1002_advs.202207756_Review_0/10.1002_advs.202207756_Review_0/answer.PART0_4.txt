[1] "Propylene is one of the main feedstocks in the chemical industry, used in the production of a great number of chemicals such as polypropylene, acrylonitrile, propylene oxide, and cymene."

[2] "The annual propylene production capacity in 2019 was about 130 megatons, and the demand is expected to reach 191 megatons by 2030, laying bare a growing gap between the supply and demand of propylene."

The growing demand for propylene has significantly influenced the development of new production methods, particularly propane dehydrogenation (PDH). The demand for propylene is expected to increase from 130 megatons in 2019 to 191 megatons by 2030, creating a substantial gap between supply and demand. This growing demand, coupled with the increased availability of propane from shale gas production, has led to heightened interest in PDH as a production method. Currently, PDH accounts for 10% of global propylene production.

The understanding of Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts for PDH has evolved considerably over time, with ongoing debates about the active Ga species. Various Ga species have been proposed as the active center for PDH, including Ga+, [GaO]+, [Ga(OH)2]+, [GaOH]2+, [GaH]2+, [GaH2]+, and Ga+H+ pair. This diversity of proposed active species highlights the complexity of the catalyst system and the challenges in identifying the exact structure responsible for catalytic activity.

Recent research has contributed significantly to our current knowledge of these catalysts. Notably, studies combining in situ transmission Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, pulse titration studies, and PDH kinetics have demonstrated that both Ga speciation and PDH performance are dependent on Ga/Al ratios and Al distributions within the zeolites. This finding emphasizes the importance of considering multiple factors in understanding and optimizing Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts for PDH, moving beyond simple identification of a single active species to a more nuanced understanding of how catalyst composition and structure influence performance.

丙烯需求的增长显著影响了新生产方法的发展，特别是丙烷脱氢（PDH）。预计丙烯需求将从2019年的1.3亿吨增加到2030年的1.91亿吨，这造成了供需之间的巨大差距。这种不断增长的需求，加上页岩气生产中丙烷可用性的提高，导致了对PDH作为生产方法的兴趣增加。目前，PDH占全球丙烯产量的10%。

对Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂在PDH中的理解随时间不断发展，关于活性Ga物种的争论仍在持续。多种Ga物种被提议作为PDH的活性中心，包括Ga+、[GaO]+、[Ga(OH)2]+、[GaOH]2+、[GaH]2+、[GaH2]+和Ga+H+对。这种提议的活性物种的多样性突显了催化剂系统的复杂性，以及确定负责催化活性的确切结构的挑战。

近期研究对我们当前对这些催化剂的认知做出了重大贡献。值得注意的是，结合原位傅里叶变换红外（FTIR）光谱、脉冲滴定研究和PDH动力学的研究表明，Ga物种和PDH性能都依赖于Ga/Al比例和沸石中Al的分布。这一发现强调了在理解和优化Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂用于PDH时考虑多个因素的重要性，不仅仅是简单地识别单一活性物种，而是更加深入地理解催化剂组成和结构如何影响性能。
