[1] "Propylene is one of the main feedstocks in the chemical industry, used in the production of a great number of chemicals such as polypropylene, acrylonitrile, propylene oxide, and cymene."

[2] "The annual propylene production capacity in 2019 was about 130 megatons, and the demand is expected to reach 191 megatons by 2030, laying bare a growing gap between the supply and demand of propylene."

[3] "The rapid increase in shale gas production—with its substantial content of natural gas liquids and thus propane—has led to increased interest in PDH: it currently accounts for 10% of global propylene production."

[4] "Different Ga species have been proposed to be the active center of the PDH, that is, Ga+, [GaO]+, [Ga(OH)2]+, [GaOH]2+, [GaH]2+, [GaH2]+, and Ga+H+ pair."

[5] "We combined in situ transmission Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, pulse titration studies, and PDH kinetics to demonstrate that the Ga speciation and their PDH performance are dependent on both Ga/Al ratios and Al distributions of the zeolites."

The growing demand for propylene has significantly influenced the development of new production methods, particularly propane dehydrogenation (PDH). This is evident from the projected increase in propylene demand from 130 megatons in 2019 to 191 megatons by 2030, highlighting a widening gap between supply and demand. The abundance of propane from shale gas production has further driven interest in PDH, which now accounts for 10% of global propylene production.

The understanding of Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts for PDH has evolved considerably over time, with ongoing debates about the active Ga species. Initially, various Ga species were proposed as the active center for PDH, including Ga+, [GaO]+, [Ga(OH)2]+, [GaOH]2+, [GaH]2+, [GaH2]+, and Ga+H+ pair. This diversity of proposed active species reflects the complexity of the catalyst system and the challenges in identifying the exact active sites.

Recent research has contributed significantly to our current knowledge of these catalysts. Notably, advanced characterization techniques such as in situ transmission Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, pulse titration studies, and PDH kinetics have been employed to investigate the relationship between Ga speciation and PDH performance. These studies have revealed that both the Ga/Al ratios and the Al distribution in the zeolites play crucial roles in determining the Ga speciation and, consequently, the catalytic performance in PDH.

This evolution in understanding highlights the complexity of the Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalyst system and emphasizes the importance of considering multiple factors, including metal-support interactions and the precise nature of the active sites, in developing more effective PDH catalysts.

丙烯需求的增长显著影响了新生产方法的发展，特别是丙烷脱氢（PDH）。这从2019年130兆吨的丙烯需求预计到2030年增长到191兆吨可见一斑，凸显了供需之间不断扩大的差距。页岩气生产带来的丙烷丰富进一步推动了对PDH的兴趣，目前PDH占全球丙烯产量的10%。

对Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂在PDH中的理解随时间不断发展，关于活性Ga物种的争论仍在继续。最初，多种Ga物种被提出作为PDH的活性中心，包括Ga+、[GaO]+、[Ga(OH)2]+、[GaOH]2+、[GaH]2+、[GaH2]+和Ga+H+对。这些提议的活性物种的多样性反映了催化剂系统的复杂性以及确定确切活性位点的挑战。

近期研究对我们目前对这些催化剂的认知做出了重大贡献。值得注意的是，先进的表征技术，如原位傅里叶变换红外（FTIR）光谱、脉冲滴定研究和PDH动力学，被用来研究Ga物种与PDH性能之间的关系。这些研究揭示了Ga/Al比率和沸石中Al分布在决定Ga物种形态及其PDH催化性能中起着关键作用。

这种理解的演变突出了Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂系统的复杂性，并强调了在开发更有效的PDH催化剂时考虑多种因素的重要性，包括金属-载体相互作用和活性位点的精确性质。
