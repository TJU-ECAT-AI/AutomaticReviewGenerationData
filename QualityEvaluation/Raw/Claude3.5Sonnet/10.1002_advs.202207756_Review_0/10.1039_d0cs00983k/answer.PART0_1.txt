The growing demand for propylene has significantly influenced the development of new production methods, particularly propane dehydrogenation (PDH). This is evidenced by the rapid application and development of PDH technologies in recent years. In China alone, the processing capacity for PDH is expected to increase more than fourfold, from about 7 million tons per annum currently to 30 million tons per annum by 2030.

The understanding of Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts for PDH has evolved over time, but there is still ongoing debate about the nature of the active Ga species. Various Ga species have been identified on the surface of Ga/H-MFI catalysts, including Ga+, GaOx clusters, [GaO]+, [Ga2O2]2+, [Ga(OH)]2+, [Ga(OH)2]+, [GaH2]+, and [GaH]2+. Different researchers have proposed different active species for the dehydrogenation of light alkanes, including Ga+, monomeric [GaO]+ or dimeric [Ga2O2]2+ cations, and [GaH]2+.

Recent research has contributed to our current knowledge of these catalysts. A significant finding is the identification of Lewis(Ga+)-Brnsted acid pairs as the active sites for propane dehydrogenation over Ga/H-ZSM-5. It has been found that increased Lewis acidity facilitates heterolytic C-H bond activation, while Brnsted acidity reduces the activation barrier for the elimination of hydrogen.

Despite these advances, the role of Brnsted and Lewis acid sites in the catalytic process is still a subject of controversy. The nature of the active sites under actual reaction conditions remains a topic of ongoing research and debate in the scientific community.

丙烯需求的不断增长极大地推动了新生产方法的发展，特别是丙烷脱氢(PDH)技术。这一点从近年来PDH技术的快速应用和发展中可以得到证实。仅在中国，PDH的加工能力预计将从目前的每年约700万吨增加到2030年的每年3000万吨，增长超过四倍。

对于PDH用Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂的理解随时间不断演进，但关于活性Ga物种的本质仍存在争议。在Ga/H-MFI催化剂表面上已经识别出多种Ga物种，包括Ga+、GaOx簇、[GaO]+、[Ga2O2]2+、[Ga(OH)]2+、[Ga(OH)2]+、[GaH2]+和[GaH]2+。不同的研究者提出了不同的轻烷烃脱氢活性物种，包括Ga+、单体[GaO]+或二聚体[Ga2O2]2+阳离子，以及[GaH]2+。

近期研究为我们对这些催化剂的认知做出了贡献。一个重要发现是在Ga/H-ZSM-5上识别出Lewis(Ga+)-Brønsted酸对作为丙烷脱氢的活性位点。研究发现，Lewis酸性的增加有助于C-H键的异裂活化，而Brønsted酸性则降低了氢消除的活化能垒。

尽管取得了这些进展，Brønsted和Lewis酸位在催化过程中的作用仍然存在争议。在实际反应条件下活性位点的本质仍然是科学界正在研究和争论的话题。
