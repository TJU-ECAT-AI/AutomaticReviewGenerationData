[1] "In recent years, the ever-increasing demand for propylene has driven the rapid application and development of propane dehydrogenation technologies. In particular, in China, it is predicted that the processing capacity of propane dehydrogenation will increase to 30 million t per annum by 2030 from about 7 million t per annum at present."

[2] "Ga-containing MFI catalysts also exhibit high dehydrogenation activity, while the nature of the active sites under reaction conditions as well as the role of Brnsted and Lewis acid sites is still discussed controversially."

[3] "On the surface of Ga/H-MFI existed all the species Ga+, GaOx clusters, [GaO]+, [Ga2O2]2+, [Ga(OH)]2+, [Ga(OH)2]+, [GaH2]+, and [GaH]2+. Among these species, Ga+, monomeric [GaO]+ or dimeric [Ga2O2]2+ cations, and [GaH]2+ have all been proposed to be active for the dehydrogenation of light alkanes."

[4] "From the aspect of the acid sites, Brnsted acid sites are considered to catalyze cracking, dehydrocyclization and coking reactions. In order to modify the acidity caused by the presence of aluminum, aluminum-free gallosilicate MFI without Ga introduction, has been synthesized and evaluated for propane dehydrogenation."

[5] "Lewis(Ga+)-Brnsted acid pairs are identified as the active sites for propane dehydrogenation over Ga/H-ZSM-5. The increased Lewis acidity facilitates heterolytic CH bond activation, and Brnsted acidity reduces the activation barrier for the elimination of hydrogen."

The growing demand for propylene has significantly driven the development and application of propane dehydrogenation (PDH) technologies. In China alone, the processing capacity for PDH is expected to increase from about 7 million tons per annum to 30 million tons per annum by 2030.

The understanding of Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts for PDH has evolved, but there is still ongoing debate about the nature of active Ga species and the role of acid sites. Various Ga species have been proposed as active sites, including Ga+, monomeric [GaO]+ or dimeric [Ga2O2]2+ cations, and [GaH]2+. 

Recent research has contributed to our current knowledge by investigating the roles of Brnsted and Lewis acid sites. Brnsted acid sites are believed to catalyze undesired reactions like cracking, dehydrocyclization, and coking. To address this, researchers have synthesized aluminum-free gallosilicate MFI catalysts to modify the acidity.

The most recent findings suggest that Lewis(Ga+)-Brnsted acid pairs are the active sites for propane dehydrogenation over Ga/H-ZSM-5. The Lewis acidity facilitates heterolytic CH bond activation, while Brnsted acidity reduces the activation barrier for hydrogen elimination. This synergistic effect between the two types of acid sites contributes to the catalyst's performance in PDH.

丙烯需求的持续增长极大地推动了丙烷脱氢(PDH)技术的发展和应用。仅在中国，PDH的处理能力预计将从目前的每年约700万吨增加到2030年的3000万吨。

对Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂在PDH中的理解已有所发展，但关于活性Ga物种的本质和酸性位点的作用仍存在争议。多种Ga物种被提出可能是活性位点，包括Ga+、单体[GaO]+或二聚体[Ga2O2]2+阳离子，以及[GaH]2+。

近期研究通过调查Brønsted酸位和Lewis酸位的作用，为我们当前的认知做出了贡献。Brønsted酸位被认为会催化裂化、脱氢环化和积碳等不良反应。为解决这个问题，研究人员合成了不含铝的镓硅MFI催化剂以改变酸性。

最新的研究发现表明，Lewis(Ga+)-Brønsted酸对是Ga/H-ZSM-5上丙烷脱氢的活性位点。Lewis酸性有助于CH键的异裂活化，而Brønsted酸性降低了氢消除的活化能垒。这两种酸性位点之间的协同效应有助于催化剂在PDH中的性能表现。
