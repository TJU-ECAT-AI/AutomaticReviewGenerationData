The growing demand for propylene has significantly influenced the development of propane dehydrogenation (PDH) technologies. In China, the processing capacity for PDH is expected to increase dramatically, from about 7 million tonnes per annum currently to 30 million tonnes per annum by 2030. This surge in demand has driven rapid application and development of PDH technologies.

Regarding Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts for PDH, understanding has evolved but remains controversial. These catalysts exhibit high dehydrogenation activity, but the nature of the active sites under reaction conditions and the roles of Brønsted and Lewis acid sites are still debated. Various Ga species have been proposed as active sites for light alkane dehydrogenation, including Ga+, monomeric [GaO]+ or dimeric [Ga2O2]2+ cations, and [GaH]2+.

Recent research has contributed to our current knowledge by identifying Lewis(Ga+)-Brønsted acid pairs as active sites for propane dehydrogenation over Ga/H-ZSM-5. The increased Lewis acidity is found to facilitate heterolytic C-H bond activation, while Brønsted acidity reduces the activation barrier for hydrogen elimination. This finding helps explain the catalytic mechanism but also highlights the complex interplay between different acid sites in these catalysts.

丙烯需求的不断增长极大地影响了丙烷脱氢(PDH)技术的发展。在中国，PDH的加工能力预计将从目前的每年约700万吨急剧增加到2030年的3000万吨。这种需求的激增推动了PDH技术的快速应用和发展。

关于Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂用于PDH的理解虽然已经有所进展，但仍存在争议。这些催化剂表现出高脱氢活性，但在反应条件下活性位点的本质以及Brønsted酸位和Lewis酸位的作用仍有争议。多种Ga物种被提出可能是轻烷烃脱氢的活性位点，包括Ga+、单体[GaO]+或二聚体[Ga2O2]2+阳离子，以及[GaH]2+。

最近的研究通过确定Lewis(Ga+)-Brønsted酸对为Ga/H-ZSM-5上丙烷脱氢的活性位点，为我们当前的认知做出了贡献。研究发现，增加的Lewis酸性有利于C-H键的异裂活化，而Brønsted酸性则降低了氢消除的活化能垒。这一发现有助于解释催化机理，但同时也突出了这些催化剂中不同酸位之间复杂的相互作用。

The growing demand for propylene has significantly influenced the development of new production methods, particularly propane dehydrogenation (PDH). This is evidenced by the rapid application and development of PDH technologies in recent years. In China alone, the processing capacity for PDH is expected to increase more than fourfold, from about 7 million tons per annum currently to 30 million tons per annum by 2030.

The understanding of Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts for PDH has evolved over time, but there is still ongoing debate about the nature of the active Ga species. Various Ga species have been identified on the surface of Ga/H-MFI catalysts, including Ga+, GaOx clusters, [GaO]+, [Ga2O2]2+, [Ga(OH)]2+, [Ga(OH)2]+, [GaH2]+, and [GaH]2+. Different researchers have proposed different active species for the dehydrogenation of light alkanes, including Ga+, monomeric [GaO]+ or dimeric [Ga2O2]2+ cations, and [GaH]2+.

Recent research has contributed to our current knowledge of these catalysts. A significant finding is the identification of Lewis(Ga+)-Brnsted acid pairs as the active sites for propane dehydrogenation over Ga/H-ZSM-5. It has been found that increased Lewis acidity facilitates heterolytic C-H bond activation, while Brnsted acidity reduces the activation barrier for the elimination of hydrogen.

Despite these advances, the role of Brnsted and Lewis acid sites in the catalytic process is still a subject of controversy. The nature of the active sites under actual reaction conditions remains a topic of ongoing research and debate in the scientific community.

尽管取得了这些进展，但在含Ga的MFI催化剂中，Brnsted和Lewis酸位的作用仍然存在争议，这表明在反应条件下，活性位点的确切性质和功能还有很多需要深入了解的地方。

Recent research has contributed to our current knowledge by investigating the roles of Brnsted and Lewis acid sites. Brnsted acid sites are believed to catalyze undesired reactions like cracking, dehydrocyclization, and coking. To address this, researchers have synthesized aluminum-free gallosilicate MFI catalysts to modify the acidity.

The most recent findings suggest that Lewis(Ga+)-Brnsted acid pairs are the active sites for propane dehydrogenation over Ga/H-ZSM-5. The Lewis acidity facilitates heterolytic CH bond activation, while Brnsted acidity reduces the activation barrier for hydrogen elimination. This synergistic effect between the two types of acid sites contributes to the catalyst's performance in PDH.

最新的研究发现表明，Lewis(Ga+)-Brønsted酸对是Ga/H-ZSM-5上丙烷脱氢的活性位点。Lewis酸性有助于CH键的异裂活化，而Brønsted酸性降低了氢消除的活化能垒。这两种酸性位点之间的协同效应有助于催化剂在PDH中的性能表现。
