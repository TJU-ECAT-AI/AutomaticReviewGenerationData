The growing demand for propylene has significantly influenced the development of new production methods, particularly propane dehydrogenation (PDH). This is evidenced by the rapid application and development of PDH technologies in recent years. In China, for example, the processing capacity of propane dehydrogenation is expected to increase more than fourfold, from about 7 million tonnes per annum currently to 30 million tonnes per annum by 2030.

Regarding Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts for PDH, the understanding has evolved over time, but there is still ongoing debate about the nature of active Ga species. Different species such as Ga+, monomeric [GaO]+ or dimeric [Ga2O2]2+ cations, and [GaH]2+ have all been proposed as active sites for light alkane dehydrogenation. 

Recent research has contributed to our current knowledge of these catalysts. A significant finding is the identification of Lewis(Ga+)-Brnsted acid pairs as active sites for propane dehydrogenation over Ga/H-ZSM-5. It has been observed that increased Lewis acidity facilitates heterolytic CH bond activation, while Brnsted acidity reduces the activation barrier for hydrogen elimination. This interplay between Lewis and Brnsted acid sites provides a more nuanced understanding of the catalytic mechanism in Ga/H-ZSM-5 for PDH.

Despite these advancements, the role of Brnsted and Lewis acid sites in Ga-containing MFI catalysts remains a subject of controversy, indicating that there is still much to be understood about the precise nature and function of active sites under reaction conditions.

丙烯需求的不断增长极大地推动了新生产方法的发展，特别是丙烷脱氢(PDH)技术。这一点从近年来PDH技术的快速应用和发展中可以看出。以中国为例，预计丙烷脱氢的加工能力将从目前的每年约700万吨增加到2030年的3000万吨，增长超过四倍。

关于Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂在PDH中的应用，尽管理解随时间不断深入，但对活性Ga物种的本质仍存在争议。不同的物种，如Ga+、单体[GaO]+或二聚体[Ga2O2]2+阳离子，以及[GaH]2+，都被提出可能是轻烷烃脱氢的活性位点。

近期研究为我们对这些催化剂的认知做出了重要贡献。一个重要发现是在Ga/H-ZSM-5上进行丙烷脱氢时，Lewis(Ga+)-Brnsted酸对被确定为活性位点。研究观察到，Lewis酸性的增加有利于CH键的异裂活化，而Brnsted酸性则降低了氢消除的活化能垒。Lewis酸位和Brnsted酸位之间的这种相互作用，为我们理解Ga/H-ZSM-5在PDH中的催化机理提供了更细致的认识。

尽管取得了这些进展，但在含Ga的MFI催化剂中，Brnsted和Lewis酸位的作用仍然存在争议，这表明在反应条件下，活性位点的确切性质和功能还有很多需要深入了解的地方。
