[1] "In recent years, the ever-increasing demand for propylene has driven the rapid application and development of propane dehydrogenation technologies. In particular, in China, it is predicted that the processing capacity of propane dehydrogenation will increase to 30 million t per annum by 2030 from about 7 million t per annum at present."

[2] "Ga-containing MFI catalysts also exhibit high dehydrogenation activity, while the nature of the active sites under reaction conditions as well as the role of Brnsted and Lewis acid sites is still discussed controversially."

Among these species, Ga+, monomeric [GaO]+ or dimeric [Ga2O2]2+ cations, and [GaH]2+ have all been proposed to be active for the dehydrogenation of light alkanes."

[4] "Lewis(Ga+)-Brnsted acid pairs are identified as the active sites for propane dehydrogenation over Ga/H-ZSM-5. The increased Lewis acidity facilitates heterolytic CH bond activation, and Brnsted acidity reduces the activation barrier for the elimination of hydrogen."

The growing demand for propylene has significantly influenced the development of new production methods, particularly propane dehydrogenation (PDH). This is evidenced by the rapid application and development of PDH technologies in recent years. In China alone, the processing capacity for PDH is expected to increase more than fourfold, from about 7 million tonnes per annum currently to 30 million tonnes per annum by 2030.

The understanding of Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts for PDH has evolved over time, but there is still ongoing debate about the nature of active Ga species. Various Ga species have been proposed as active sites for light alkane dehydrogenation, including Ga+, monomeric [GaO]+ or dimeric [Ga2O2]2+ cations, and [GaH]2+. Recent research has contributed to our current knowledge by identifying Lewis(Ga+)-Brnsted acid pairs as the active sites for propane dehydrogenation over Ga/H-ZSM-5. This finding suggests that increased Lewis acidity facilitates heterolytic CH bond activation, while Brnsted acidity reduces the activation barrier for hydrogen elimination.

Despite these advancements, the role of Brnsted and Lewis acid sites in the catalytic process remains a subject of controversy. The complex nature of the Ga species present on the catalyst surface, including various clusters and hydroxide forms, contributes to the ongoing debate. This highlights the need for further research to fully elucidate the mechanism of PDH over Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts.

丙烯需求的持续增长极大地推动了新生产方法的发展，特别是丙烷脱氢(PDH)技术。这一点从近年来PDH技术的快速应用和发展中可以得到证实。仅在中国，PDH的加工能力预计将从目前的每年约700万吨增加到2030年的每年3000万吨，增长超过四倍。

对于PDH反应中Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂的理解随时间不断演变，但关于活性Ga物种的本质仍存在争议。多种Ga物种被提出可能是轻烷烃脱氢的活性位点，包括Ga+、单体[GaO]+或二聚体[Ga2O2]2+阳离子，以及[GaH]2+。最新研究为我们当前的认知做出了贡献，确定了Lewis(Ga+)-Brnsted酸对是Ga/H-ZSM-5上丙烷脱氢的活性位点。这一发现表明，增加Lewis酸性有利于促进CH键的异裂活化，而Brnsted酸性则降低了氢气消除的活化能障。

尽管取得了这些进展，Brnsted和Lewis酸位在催化过程中的作用仍然存在争议。催化剂表面存在的Ga物种的复杂性，包括各种簇合物和氢氧化物形式，加深了这一持续争论。这突显了需要进一步研究以充分阐明Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂上PDH反应机理的必要性。
