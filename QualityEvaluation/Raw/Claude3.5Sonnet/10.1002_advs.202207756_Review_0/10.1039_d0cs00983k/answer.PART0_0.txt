The growing demand for propylene has significantly influenced the development of propane dehydrogenation (PDH) technologies. In China, the processing capacity for PDH is expected to increase dramatically, from about 7 million tonnes per annum currently to 30 million tonnes per annum by 2030. This surge in demand has driven rapid application and development of PDH technologies.

Regarding Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts for PDH, understanding has evolved but remains controversial. These catalysts exhibit high dehydrogenation activity, but the nature of the active sites under reaction conditions and the roles of Brønsted and Lewis acid sites are still debated. Various Ga species have been proposed as active sites for light alkane dehydrogenation, including Ga+, monomeric [GaO]+ or dimeric [Ga2O2]2+ cations, and [GaH]2+.

Recent research has contributed to our current knowledge by identifying Lewis(Ga+)-Brønsted acid pairs as active sites for propane dehydrogenation over Ga/H-ZSM-5. The increased Lewis acidity is found to facilitate heterolytic C-H bond activation, while Brønsted acidity reduces the activation barrier for hydrogen elimination. This finding helps explain the catalytic mechanism but also highlights the complex interplay between different acid sites in these catalysts.

丙烯需求的不断增长极大地影响了丙烷脱氢(PDH)技术的发展。在中国，PDH的加工能力预计将从目前的每年约700万吨急剧增加到2030年的3000万吨。这种需求的激增推动了PDH技术的快速应用和发展。

关于Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂用于PDH的理解虽然已经有所进展，但仍存在争议。这些催化剂表现出高脱氢活性，但在反应条件下活性位点的本质以及Brønsted酸位和Lewis酸位的作用仍有争议。多种Ga物种被提出可能是轻烷烃脱氢的活性位点，包括Ga+、单体[GaO]+或二聚体[Ga2O2]2+阳离子，以及[GaH]2+。

最近的研究通过确定Lewis(Ga+)-Brønsted酸对为Ga/H-ZSM-5上丙烷脱氢的活性位点，为我们当前的认知做出了贡献。研究发现，增加的Lewis酸性有利于C-H键的异裂活化，而Brønsted酸性则降低了氢消除的活化能垒。这一发现有助于解释催化机理，但同时也突出了这些催化剂中不同酸位之间复杂的相互作用。
