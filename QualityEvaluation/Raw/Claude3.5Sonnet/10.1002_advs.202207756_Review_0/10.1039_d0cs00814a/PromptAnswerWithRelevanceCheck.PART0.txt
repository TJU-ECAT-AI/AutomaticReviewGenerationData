Conventional propylene production processes involve fluid catalytic cracking, and steam cracking of naphtha and light diesel. However, with the rapid consumption of fossil energy, traditional propylene production methods can no longer meet the increasing demands."

[2] "PDH technology is considered to be one of the most promising propylene production methods because it is a proprietary method that produces only propylene, not a hybrid product."

[3] "The Dow Chemical Company released a forecast in 2016 that the demand for propylene will grow at an average annual rate of 2% to 3% by 2035, which is expected to exceed production capacity between 2016 and 2035."

[4] "Recently, Kenichi Shimizu and coworkers found the formation of indium (In)-hydride species supported by chabazite (CHA) zeolites after H2 pretreatment at high temperatures (4500 1C). In situ Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy and DFT calculations demonstrated that the [InH2]+ ion on a framework anionic site is the authentic structure."

[5] "Additionally, the active sites for PDH in Ga/H-ZSM-5 with medium quantities of tetrahedral aluminum in the lattice were distinguished to be LewisBrnsted acid pairs.

The growing demand for propylene has significantly influenced the development of new production methods, particularly propane dehydrogenation (PDH). Traditional production methods like fluid catalytic cracking and steam cracking of naphtha and light diesel can no longer meet the increasing demands due to rapid consumption of fossil energy. PDH technology has emerged as one of the most promising propylene production methods because it produces only propylene, without hybrid products.

The Dow Chemical Company's forecast in 2016 predicted that propylene demand would grow at an average annual rate of 2% to 3% by 2035, potentially exceeding production capacity between 2016 and 2035. This growing demand has driven research and development in PDH technologies and catalysts.

Regarding Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts for PDH, understanding has evolved significantly. There has been ongoing debate about the nature of active Ga species. Recent research has contributed to our current knowledge of these catalysts. For instance, studies have shown that the active sites for PDH in Ga/H-ZSM-5 with medium quantities of tetrahedral aluminum in the lattice are Lewis-Brønsted acid pairs. 

Specifically, it was found that [GaH]2+, together with a basic framework oxygen of the Brønsted-acid site, heterolytically activates a propane C-H bond with a very low intrinsic enthalpy barrier of 56 kJ mol-1. This finding provides insight into the mechanism of C-H bond activation in these catalysts.

Furthermore, related research on other metal-zeolite systems, such as indium-based catalysts, has contributed to the broader understanding of metal-hydride species in zeolites for PDH. For example, the formation of indium (In)-hydride species supported by chabazite (CHA) zeolites after H2 pretreatment at high temperatures has been observed, with [InH2]+ ion on a framework anionic site identified as the authentic structure.

These advancements in understanding the active sites and mechanisms in Ga/H-ZSM-5 and related catalysts have contributed significantly to the development of more efficient PDH processes to meet the growing demand for propylene.

丙烯需求的增长显著影响了新生产方法的发展，特别是丙烷脱氢(PDH)技术。由于化石能源的快速消耗，传统的生产方法如流化催化裂化和石脑油及轻柴油的蒸汽裂解已无法满足日益增长的需求。PDH技术因其只生产丙烯而不产生混合产品的特性，被认为是最有前景的丙烯生产方法之一。

陶氏化学公司在2016年的预测显示，到2035年丙烯需求将以平均每年2%至3%的速度增长，可能在2016年至2035年间超过生产能力。这种不断增长的需求推动了PDH技术和催化剂的研究和开发。

关于Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂在PDH中的应用，我们的理解已经有了显著的进展。对于活性Ga物种的本质一直存在争议。最近的研究为我们对这些催化剂的认知做出了重要贡献。例如，研究表明，在含有中等数量四面体铝的Ga/H-ZSM-5晶格中，PDH的活性位点是Lewis-Brønsted酸对。

具体来说，发现[GaH]2+与Brønsted酸位点的碱性框架氧一起，能以非常低的本征焓垒（56 kJ mol-1）异裂活化丙烷的C-H键。这一发现为理解这些催化剂中C-H键的活化机制提供了新的见解。

此外，对其他金属-沸石体系（如铟基催化剂）的相关研究也促进了我们对PDH中沸石负载金属氢化物物种的更广泛理解。例如，在高温H2预处理后，观察到了斜发沸石(CHA)负载的铟(In)氢化物物种的形成，并确定了框架阴离子位点上的[InH2]+离子为真实结构。

这些在理解Ga/H-ZSM-5及相关催化剂活性位点和机理方面的进展，为开发更高效的PDH工艺以满足不断增长的丙烯需求做出了重要贡献。

For bulk GaOx, some researchers think that Ga3+ ions are evenly distributed on the octahedron and tetrahedron, which can provide a large number of weak acid sites.

The growing demand for propylene has significantly influenced the development of new production methods, particularly propane dehydrogenation (PDH). Traditional methods of propylene production, such as fluid catalytic cracking and steam cracking of naphtha and light diesel, have become insufficient to meet the increasing demand due to the rapid consumption of fossil fuels. This shortage has led to the development of alternative production methods, with PDH emerging as one of the most promising technologies.

PDH is considered particularly advantageous because it is a proprietary method that produces only propylene, without generating other byproducts. This specificity makes it an attractive option for meeting the growing propylene demand. The urgency of developing such technologies is underscored by forecasts, such as the one from Dow Chemical Company in 2016, which predicted that propylene demand would grow at an average annual rate of 2% to 3% by 2035, potentially exceeding production capacity between 2016 and 2035.

Regarding Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts for PDH, the understanding has evolved significantly, but there is still ongoing debate about the nature of active Ga species. Initially, studies showed that the active sites in Ga2O3 were Lewis acid sites provided by coordinatively unsaturated Ga3+ ions. For bulk GaOx, some researchers proposed that Ga3+ ions evenly distributed on octahedral and tetrahedral sites provide numerous weak acid sites that contribute to catalytic activity.

However, recent research has brought new insights into the active sites of Ga species in ZSM-5 zeolites. A significant finding is the identification of [GaH]2+ ions, working in conjunction with a basic framework oxygen of the Brnsted-acid site, as active sites for PDH. This discovery represents a shift in understanding from the earlier focus on Ga3+ species alone.

The evolving knowledge about Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts highlights the complexity of these systems and the need for continued research to fully elucidate the nature and behavior of active sites in PDH reactions. The ongoing debate and new findings contribute to a more nuanced understanding of these catalysts, potentially leading to improved catalyst design and more efficient PDH processes in the future.

丙烯需求的增长显著影响了新生产方法的发展，特别是丙烷脱氢(PDH)技术。由于化石燃料的快速消耗，传统的丙烯生产方法，如流化催化裂化和石脑油及轻柴油的蒸汽裂解，已无法满足不断增长的需求。这种短缺导致了替代生产方法的开发，其中PDH技术成为最有前景的技术之一。

PDH被认为特别有优势，因为它是一种专有方法，只生产丙烯，不产生其他副产品。这种特异性使其成为满足不断增长的丙烯需求的一个有吸引力的选择。开发这类技术的紧迫性由一些预测所强调，例如陶氏化学公司2016年的预测，预计到2035年丙烯需求将以平均每年2%至3%的速度增长，可能在2016年至2035年间超过生产能力。

关于Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂在PDH中的应用，尽管理解已经显著进步，但对活性Ga物种的本质仍存在争议。最初，研究表明Ga2O3中的活性位点是由配位不饱和的Ga3+离子提供的路易斯酸位点。对于块状GaOx，一些研究人员提出，均匀分布在八面体和四面体位点上的Ga3+离子提供了大量的弱酸位点，这些位点有助于催化活性。

然而，最近的研究对ZSM-5沸石中Ga物种的活性位点带来了新的见解。一个重要发现是[GaH]2+离子与布朗斯特酸位点的基本骨架氧一起作为PDH的活性位点。这一发现代表了从早期仅关注Ga3+物种到现在更复杂理解的转变。

关于Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂知识的演变突出了这些系统的复杂性，以及需要继续研究以充分阐明PDH反应中活性位点的性质和行为。持续的争论和新发现有助于对这些催化剂形成更加细致的理解，可能导致未来催化剂设计的改进和更高效的PDH过程。

The growing demand for propylene has significantly influenced the development of new production methods, particularly propane dehydrogenation (PDH). This is driven by several factors:

1. Propylene is a crucial raw material for many industrial products, creating a constant demand.

2. The development of hydraulic fracturing technology has made propane, the feedstock for PDH, cheaper and more abundant.

3. Forecasts predict that propylene demand will grow faster than production capacity in the coming years.

4. PDH technology is considered one of the most promising propylene production methods due to its ability to produce pure propylene without byproducts.

Regarding Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts for PDH, our understanding has evolved considerably, although some debates about active Ga species persist. Initially, coordinatively unsaturated Ga3+ was thought to be the active site, providing Lewis acidity. However, recent research has identified more complex active sites:

1. [GaH]2+ ions, in conjunction with a basic framework oxygen of the Brønsted-acid site, have been identified as active sites in Ga species in ZSM-5 zeolites.

2. Lewis-Brønsted acid pairs have been distinguished as active sites in Ga/H-ZSM-5 with medium quantities of tetrahedral aluminum in the lattice.

3. The [GaH]2+ species, together with a basic framework oxygen of the Brønsted-acid site, has been found to heterolytically activate propane C-H bonds with a very low energy barrier.

These findings contribute to our current knowledge by highlighting the importance of the interplay between different species (Ga, H, and framework oxygen) in creating active sites for PDH. The research also emphasizes the role of both Lewis and Brønsted acidity in the catalytic process, moving beyond the initial understanding of simple Ga3+ Lewis acid sites.

The growing demand for propylene has significantly influenced the development of new production methods, particularly propane dehydrogenation (PDH). This is due to the increasing importance of propylene as a raw material for various industrial products and the forecast of propylene demand growth exceeding production capacity. PDH technology has emerged as one of the most promising methods for propylene production because it exclusively produces propylene without hybrid products.

The understanding of Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts for PDH has evolved considerably, with ongoing debates about the nature of active Ga species. Initially, studies suggested that the active sites in Ga2O3 were Lewis acid sites provided by coordinatively unsaturated Ga3+. However, recent research has provided new insights into the active sites and mechanisms involved.

Recent findings have contributed to our current knowledge of these catalysts. For instance, the preparation of cerium gallium mixed oxides through co-precipitation methods revealed that on ceria-gallia mixed oxide interfaces, gallium sites break the H-H bond, forming GaH and OH surface sites. These sites then recombine to form water and an oxygen vacancy, reducing Ce4+ to Ce3+.

Furthermore, in Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts with medium quantities of tetrahedral aluminum in the lattice, the active sites for PDH were identified as Lewis-Brønsted acid pairs. Specifically, [GaH]2+ species, together with a basic framework oxygen of the Brønsted-acid site, can heterolytically activate a propane C-H bond with a very low intrinsic enthalpy barrier. This finding provides a more detailed understanding of the catalytic mechanism and the specific role of gallium species in the PDH process.

These advancements in our understanding of Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts have contributed to the ongoing development of more efficient and selective catalysts for PDH, addressing the growing demand for propylene production.
