The growing demand for propylene has significantly influenced the development of new production methods, particularly propane dehydrogenation (PDH). This is driven by several factors:

1. Propylene is a crucial raw material for many industrial products, creating a constant demand.

2. The development of hydraulic fracturing technology has made propane, the feedstock for PDH, cheaper and more abundant.

3. Forecasts predict that propylene demand will grow faster than production capacity in the coming years.

4. PDH technology is considered one of the most promising propylene production methods due to its ability to produce pure propylene without byproducts.

Regarding Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts for PDH, our understanding has evolved considerably, although some debates about active Ga species persist. Initially, coordinatively unsaturated Ga3+ was thought to be the active site, providing Lewis acidity. However, recent research has identified more complex active sites:

1. [GaH]2+ ions, in conjunction with a basic framework oxygen of the Brønsted-acid site, have been identified as active sites in Ga species in ZSM-5 zeolites.

2. Lewis-Brønsted acid pairs have been distinguished as active sites in Ga/H-ZSM-5 with medium quantities of tetrahedral aluminum in the lattice.

3. The [GaH]2+ species, together with a basic framework oxygen of the Brønsted-acid site, has been found to heterolytically activate propane C-H bonds with a very low energy barrier.

These findings contribute to our current knowledge by highlighting the importance of the interplay between different species (Ga, H, and framework oxygen) in creating active sites for PDH. The research also emphasizes the role of both Lewis and Brønsted acidity in the catalytic process, moving beyond the initial understanding of simple Ga3+ Lewis acid sites.

丙烯需求的增长显著影响了新生产方法的开发，特别是丙烷脱氢（PDH）技术。这主要由以下几个因素驱动：

1. 丙烯是许多工业产品的关键原材料，持续创造需求。

2. 水力压裂技术的发展使丙烷（PDH的原料）变得更便宜且更加丰富。

3. 预测显示，未来几年丙烯需求的增长速度将超过生产能力。

4. PDH技术被认为是最有前途的丙烯生产方法之一，因为它能生产纯丙烯而无副产品。

关于Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂在PDH中的应用，我们的理解已经有了很大进展，尽管对活性Ga物种的一些争论仍然存在。最初，人们认为配位不饱和的Ga3+是提供Lewis酸性的活性位点。然而，最近的研究发现了更复杂的活性位点：

1. 在ZSM-5沸石中，[GaH]2+离子与Brønsted酸位点的碱性骨架氧一起被确定为Ga物种的活性位点。

2. 在含有中等数量四面体铝的Ga/H-ZSM-5中，Lewis-Brønsted酸对被识别为活性位点。

3. 研究发现，[GaH]2+物种与Brønsted酸位点的碱性骨架氧一起，可以以很低的能垒异裂活化丙烷的C-H键。

这些发现对我们当前的认知贡献重大，强调了不同物种（Ga、H和骨架氧）之间相互作用在创造PDH活性位点中的重要性。研究还强调了Lewis酸性和Brønsted酸性在催化过程中的作用，超越了最初对简单Ga3+ Lewis酸位点的理解。
