The growing demand for propylene has significantly influenced the development of new production methods, particularly propane dehydrogenation (PDH). Traditional methods of propylene production, such as fluid catalytic cracking and steam cracking of naphtha and light diesel, have become insufficient to meet the increasing demand due to the rapid consumption of fossil fuels. This shortage has led to the development of alternative production methods, with PDH emerging as one of the most promising technologies.

PDH is considered particularly advantageous because it is a proprietary method that produces only propylene, without generating other byproducts. This specificity makes it an attractive option for meeting the growing propylene demand. The urgency of developing such technologies is underscored by forecasts, such as the one from Dow Chemical Company in 2016, which predicted that propylene demand would grow at an average annual rate of 2% to 3% by 2035, potentially exceeding production capacity between 2016 and 2035.

Regarding Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts for PDH, the understanding has evolved significantly, but there is still ongoing debate about the nature of active Ga species. Initially, studies showed that the active sites in Ga2O3 were Lewis acid sites provided by coordinatively unsaturated Ga3+ ions. For bulk GaOx, some researchers proposed that Ga3+ ions evenly distributed on octahedral and tetrahedral sites provide numerous weak acid sites that contribute to catalytic activity.

However, recent research has brought new insights into the active sites of Ga species in ZSM-5 zeolites. A significant finding is the identification of [GaH]2+ ions, working in conjunction with a basic framework oxygen of the Brnsted-acid site, as active sites for PDH. This discovery represents a shift in understanding from the earlier focus on Ga3+ species alone.

The evolving knowledge about Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts highlights the complexity of these systems and the need for continued research to fully elucidate the nature and behavior of active sites in PDH reactions. The ongoing debate and new findings contribute to a more nuanced understanding of these catalysts, potentially leading to improved catalyst design and more efficient PDH processes in the future.

丙烯需求的增长显著影响了新生产方法的发展，特别是丙烷脱氢(PDH)技术。由于化石燃料的快速消耗，传统的丙烯生产方法，如流化催化裂化和石脑油及轻柴油的蒸汽裂解，已无法满足不断增长的需求。这种短缺导致了替代生产方法的开发，其中PDH技术成为最有前景的技术之一。

PDH被认为特别有优势，因为它是一种专有方法，只生产丙烯，不产生其他副产品。这种特异性使其成为满足不断增长的丙烯需求的一个有吸引力的选择。开发这类技术的紧迫性由一些预测所强调，例如陶氏化学公司2016年的预测，预计到2035年丙烯需求将以平均每年2%至3%的速度增长，可能在2016年至2035年间超过生产能力。

关于Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂在PDH中的应用，尽管理解已经显著进步，但对活性Ga物种的本质仍存在争议。最初，研究表明Ga2O3中的活性位点是由配位不饱和的Ga3+离子提供的路易斯酸位点。对于块状GaOx，一些研究人员提出，均匀分布在八面体和四面体位点上的Ga3+离子提供了大量的弱酸位点，这些位点有助于催化活性。

然而，最近的研究对ZSM-5沸石中Ga物种的活性位点带来了新的见解。一个重要发现是[GaH]2+离子与布朗斯特酸位点的基本骨架氧一起作为PDH的活性位点。这一发现代表了从早期仅关注Ga3+物种到现在更复杂理解的转变。

关于Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂知识的演变突出了这些系统的复杂性，以及需要继续研究以充分阐明PDH反应中活性位点的性质和行为。持续的争论和新发现有助于对这些催化剂形成更加细致的理解，可能导致未来催化剂设计的改进和更高效的PDH过程。
