The growing demand for propylene has significantly influenced the development of new production methods, particularly propane dehydrogenation (PDH). This is driven by several factors:

1. Propylene is a crucial raw material for numerous industrial products, creating a substantial and growing demand.

2. The development of hydraulic fracturing technology has made propane, the feedstock for PDH, more abundant and cost-effective.

3. Forecasts predict that propylene demand will outpace production capacity in the coming years, necessitating new production methods.

4. There is a push for more environmentally friendly and economically viable catalysts, driving research into alternatives to traditional methods.

The understanding of Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts for PDH has evolved significantly, but there is still ongoing debate about the active Ga species. Initially, it was believed that the active sites were Lewis acid sites provided by coordinatively unsaturated Ga3+. However, recent research has identified [GaH]2+ ions, in conjunction with a basic framework oxygen of the Brønsted-acid site, as active sites in Ga species in ZSM-5 zeolites. This evolution in understanding demonstrates the complexity of these catalysts and the ongoing nature of research in this field. The debate continues as researchers work to fully elucidate the nature and behavior of active sites in Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts for PDH.

丙烯需求的增长显著影响了新生产方法的发展，特别是丙烷脱氢(PDH)。这受到几个因素的驱动：

1. 丙烯是众多工业产品的关键原料，创造了巨大且不断增长的需求。

2. 水力压裂技术的发展使丙烷（PDH的原料）变得更加丰富和经济实惠。

3. 预测显示，未来几年丙烯需求将超过产能，需要新的生产方法。

4. 对更环保和经济可行的催化剂的需求推动了对传统方法替代品的研究。

对Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂在PDH中的理解已经有了显著的进展，但关于活性Ga物种仍存在争议。最初认为活性位点是由配位不饱和的Ga3+提供的路易斯酸位点。然而，最近的研究发现，在ZSM-5分子筛中的Ga物种中，[GaH]2+离子与布朗斯特酸位点的碱性骨架氧共同作为活性位点。这种理解的演变表明了这些催化剂的复杂性和该领域研究的持续性质。随着研究人员努力全面阐明Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂在PDH中活性位点的性质和行为，争论仍在继续。
