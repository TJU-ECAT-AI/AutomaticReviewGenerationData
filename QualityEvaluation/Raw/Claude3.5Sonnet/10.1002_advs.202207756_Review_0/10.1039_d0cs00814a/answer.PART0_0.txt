The growing demand for propylene has significantly influenced the development of new production methods, particularly propane dehydrogenation (PDH). Traditional production methods like fluid catalytic cracking and steam cracking of naphtha and light diesel can no longer meet the increasing demands due to rapid consumption of fossil energy. PDH technology has emerged as one of the most promising propylene production methods because it produces only propylene, without hybrid products.

The Dow Chemical Company's forecast in 2016 predicted that propylene demand would grow at an average annual rate of 2% to 3% by 2035, potentially exceeding production capacity between 2016 and 2035. This growing demand has driven research and development in PDH technologies and catalysts.

Regarding Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts for PDH, understanding has evolved significantly. There has been ongoing debate about the nature of active Ga species. Recent research has contributed to our current knowledge of these catalysts. For instance, studies have shown that the active sites for PDH in Ga/H-ZSM-5 with medium quantities of tetrahedral aluminum in the lattice are Lewis-Brønsted acid pairs. 

Specifically, it was found that [GaH]2+, together with a basic framework oxygen of the Brønsted-acid site, heterolytically activates a propane C-H bond with a very low intrinsic enthalpy barrier of 56 kJ mol-1. This finding provides insight into the mechanism of C-H bond activation in these catalysts.

Furthermore, related research on other metal-zeolite systems, such as indium-based catalysts, has contributed to the broader understanding of metal-hydride species in zeolites for PDH. For example, the formation of indium (In)-hydride species supported by chabazite (CHA) zeolites after H2 pretreatment at high temperatures has been observed, with [InH2]+ ion on a framework anionic site identified as the authentic structure.

These advancements in understanding the active sites and mechanisms in Ga/H-ZSM-5 and related catalysts have contributed significantly to the development of more efficient PDH processes to meet the growing demand for propylene.

丙烯需求的增长显著影响了新生产方法的发展，特别是丙烷脱氢(PDH)技术。由于化石能源的快速消耗，传统的生产方法如流化催化裂化和石脑油及轻柴油的蒸汽裂解已无法满足日益增长的需求。PDH技术因其只生产丙烯而不产生混合产品的特性，被认为是最有前景的丙烯生产方法之一。

陶氏化学公司在2016年的预测显示，到2035年丙烯需求将以平均每年2%至3%的速度增长，可能在2016年至2035年间超过生产能力。这种不断增长的需求推动了PDH技术和催化剂的研究和开发。

关于Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂在PDH中的应用，我们的理解已经有了显著的进展。对于活性Ga物种的本质一直存在争议。最近的研究为我们对这些催化剂的认知做出了重要贡献。例如，研究表明，在含有中等数量四面体铝的Ga/H-ZSM-5晶格中，PDH的活性位点是Lewis-Brønsted酸对。

具体来说，发现[GaH]2+与Brønsted酸位点的碱性框架氧一起，能以非常低的本征焓垒（56 kJ mol-1）异裂活化丙烷的C-H键。这一发现为理解这些催化剂中C-H键的活化机制提供了新的见解。

此外，对其他金属-沸石体系（如铟基催化剂）的相关研究也促进了我们对PDH中沸石负载金属氢化物物种的更广泛理解。例如，在高温H2预处理后，观察到了斜发沸石(CHA)负载的铟(In)氢化物物种的形成，并确定了框架阴离子位点上的[InH2]+离子为真实结构。

这些在理解Ga/H-ZSM-5及相关催化剂活性位点和机理方面的进展，为开发更高效的PDH工艺以满足不断增长的丙烯需求做出了重要贡献。
