[1] "Propylene is the basic raw material for the production of acrolein, polypropylene, acetone, acrylonitrile, propylene oxide and other industrial products."

[2] "Therefore, the development of highly efficient propylene production technologies is of vital importance, both scientifically and economically."

[3] "Especially, PDH technology is considered to be one of the most promising propylene production methods because it is a proprietary method that produces only propylene, not a hybrid product."

[4] "The Dow Chemical Company released a forecast in 2016 that the demand for propylene will grow at an average annual rate of 2% to 3% by 2035, which is expected to exceed production capacity between 2016 and 2035."

[5] "Studies have shown that the active site of Ga2O3 is the Lewis acid site provided by coordinatively unsaturated Ga3+."

[6] "Recently, Julia Vecchietti et al. prepared cerium gallium mixed oxides through co-precipitation methods. On the ceriagallia mixed oxides interfaces, gallium sites break the HH bond forming GaH and OH surface sites, which recombine to form water and an oxygen vacancy that reduce Ce4+ to Ce3+."

[7] "Additionally, the active sites for PDH in Ga/H-ZSM-5 with medium quantities of tetrahedral aluminum in the lattice were distinguished to be LewisBrnsted acid pairs. The [GaH]2+, together with a basic framework oxygen of the Brnsted-acid site, heterolytically activates a propane CH bond with a very low intrinsic enthalpy barrier of 56 kJ mol1."

The growing demand for propylene has significantly influenced the development of new production methods, particularly propane dehydrogenation (PDH). This is due to the increasing importance of propylene as a raw material for various industrial products and the forecast of propylene demand growth exceeding production capacity. PDH technology has emerged as one of the most promising methods for propylene production because it exclusively produces propylene without hybrid products.

The understanding of Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts for PDH has evolved considerably, with ongoing debates about the nature of active Ga species. Initially, studies suggested that the active sites in Ga2O3 were Lewis acid sites provided by coordinatively unsaturated Ga3+. However, recent research has provided new insights into the active sites and mechanisms involved.

Recent findings have contributed to our current knowledge of these catalysts. For instance, the preparation of cerium gallium mixed oxides through co-precipitation methods revealed that on ceria-gallia mixed oxide interfaces, gallium sites break the H-H bond, forming GaH and OH surface sites. These sites then recombine to form water and an oxygen vacancy, reducing Ce4+ to Ce3+.

Furthermore, in Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts with medium quantities of tetrahedral aluminum in the lattice, the active sites for PDH were identified as Lewis-Brønsted acid pairs. Specifically, [GaH]2+ species, together with a basic framework oxygen of the Brønsted-acid site, can heterolytically activate a propane C-H bond with a very low intrinsic enthalpy barrier. This finding provides a more detailed understanding of the catalytic mechanism and the specific role of gallium species in the PDH process.

These advancements in our understanding of Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts have contributed to the ongoing development of more efficient and selective catalysts for PDH, addressing the growing demand for propylene production.

丙烯需求的增长显著影响了新生产方法的发展，特别是丙烷脱氢(PDH)技术。这是由于丙烯作为各种工业产品原料的重要性日益增加，以及预测丙烯需求增长将超过生产能力。PDH技术已成为丙烯生产最有前景的方法之一，因为它专门生产丙烯，不产生混合产品。

对Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂在PDH中的理解已经有了很大的进展，但关于活性Ga物种的本质仍存在争议。最初，研究表明Ga2O3中的活性位点是由配位不饱和的Ga3+提供的Lewis酸位点。然而，近期研究为活性位点和涉及的机制提供了新的见解。

最新研究发现为我们对这些催化剂的认知做出了贡献。例如，通过共沉淀方法制备的铈镓混合氧化物显示，在铈镓混合氧化物界面上，镓位点打破H-H键，形成GaH和OH表面位点。这些位点随后重新结合形成水和氧空位，将Ce4+还原为Ce3+。

此外，在具有中等四面体铝含量的Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂中，PDH的活性位点被确定为Lewis-Brønsted酸对。具体来说，[GaH]2+物种与Brønsted酸位点的碱性骨架氧一起，可以以很低的本征焓垒异裂活化丙烷的C-H键。这一发现为催化机理和镓物种在PDH过程中的具体作用提供了更详细的理解。

这些对Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂理解的进展，为开发更高效和选择性的PDH催化剂做出了贡献，以满足不断增长的丙烯生产需求。
