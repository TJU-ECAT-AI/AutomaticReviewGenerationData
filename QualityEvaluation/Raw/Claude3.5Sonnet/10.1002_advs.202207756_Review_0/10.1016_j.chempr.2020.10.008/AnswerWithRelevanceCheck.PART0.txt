          [1] "A change of feedstock from naphtha to light alkanes, due to the emergence of shale gas and the increasing availability of natural gas, has led to an increasing development of on-purpose propane dehydrogenation (PDH) technologies."

          [2] "PDH is an extremely energy-intensive process largely due to the high positive enthalpy of the reactions (DrH = 124 kJ mol1), necessitating high reaction temperatures, which presents grand challenges for alkene selectivity and catalyst stability."

          [3] "To tackle these challenges, the active site isolation strategy has been proved to be effective."

          The growing demand for propylene has led to the development of on-purpose propane dehydrogenation (PDH) technologies. This shift has been driven by changes in feedstock availability, particularly the increased access to light alkanes from shale gas and natural gas sources. PDH has emerged as an important method for propylene production, but it faces challenges due to its energy-intensive nature. The process requires high reaction temperatures because of the high positive enthalpy of the reactions (DrH = 124 kJ mol-1), which in turn creates difficulties in maintaining alkene selectivity and catalyst stability. To address these issues, researchers have focused on active site isolation strategies.

          The literature does not provide specific information about Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts for PDH, the debate about active Ga species, or recent research findings related to these catalysts. Therefore, this part of the question cannot be answered based on the given text.

          丙烯需求的增长推动了定向丙烷脱氢(PDH)技术的发展。这种转变主要是由原料供应的变化驱动的，特别是页岩气和天然气资源带来的轻烷烃供应增加。PDH已成为丙烯生产的重要方法，但由于其高能耗性质面临挑战。由于反应的高正焓值(DrH = 124 kJ mol-1)，该过程需要高反应温度，这反过来又给保持烯烃选择性和催化剂稳定性带来困难。为解决这些问题，研究人员集中于活性位点隔离策略。

          文献中没有提供关于Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂用于PDH的具体信息，也没有关于活性Ga物种的争论或与这些催化剂相关的最新研究发现。因此，基于给定的文本无法回答问题的这一部分。
