SUMMARY
Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) is a commercial propylene produc-
tion technology that has received much attention, but high reaction
temperatures result in a decrease of propylene selectivity and cata-
lyst stability. This paper describes a single-site [PtZn4] catalyst by
assembling atomically ordered intermetallic alloy (IMA) as a selec-
tive and ultrastable PDH catalyst. The catalyst enables more than
95% of propylene selectivity from 520C to 620C. No obvious deac-
tivation is observed within the 160-h test, superior to PtSn/Al2O3
and state-of-the-art Pt-based catalysts. Based on in situ X-ray ab-
sorption fine structure, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy measure-
ments, and density functional theory calculations, we reveal that the
surface [PtZn4] ensembles in PtZn IMAs serve as the key active site
structures, wherein the geometry-isolated and electron-rich Pt1
site in [PtZn4] ensembles readily promotes the first and second C
H cleavage of propane but inhibits further dehydrogenation of sur-
face-bounded propylene. This significantly improves the selectivity
and stability by prohibiting coke side reactions.
INTRODUCTION
A change of feedstock from naphtha to light alkanes, due to the emergence of shale
gas and the increasing availability of natural gas, has led to an increasing develop-
ment of on-purpose propane dehydrogenation (PDH) technologies.13 PDH is an
extremely energy-intensive process largely due to the high positive enthalpy of
the reactions (DrH = 124 kJ mol1), necessitating high reaction temperatures,46
which presents grand challenges for alkene selectivity and catalyst stability.7 Espe-
cially, it has been shown that larger ensembles of active sites catalyze structure-sen-
sitive side reactions, including cracking and deep dehydrogenation, leading to the
production of C1 and C2 molecules and coke.8
To tackle these challenges, the active site isolation strategy has been proved to be
effective.911 Isolating the active metal components into the single-atom site and the
resulting single-atom catalysts (SACs) could inhibit the structure-sensitive side reac-
tions.2,9,1215 For example, the isolated Pt1 site in Pt/Cu single-atom alloy (SAA) can
only interact with a single Pt atom for the deep dehydrogenated C3H5, a model pre-
cursor of coke formation, instead of three more stable PtC interactions on a 3-fold
Pt3 hollow site over Pt (111), leading to less carbon deposition. However, the long-
term stability of Pt/Cu SAAs is disillusionary due to its thermal and chemical instabil-
ities.9,16,17 Although single-site Zn(II),18 Co(II),19 Ni(II),20 and Ga(III)21 on silica have
been developed, these active sites suffer from low intrinsic activity and reduction
The Bigger Picture
Propane dehydrogenation (PDH)
is a commercial propylene
production technology, but high
reaction temperatures result in
cracking and coking. Isolating
active metal components into
single atoms can maximize atomic
efficiency, and the resulting
single-atom catalysts (SACs) could
inhibit structure-sensitive side
reactions with unprecedented
selectivity.
Herein, we report a single-site
[PtZn4] catalyst by assembling
atomically ordered PtZn
intermetallic alloys, which enables
more than 95% selectivity of
propylene over a broad
temperature range of 520C to
620C. No obvious deactivation is
observed within the 160-h
industrial PDH test. We reveal that
the surface [PtZn4] ensembles in
PtZn IMAs serve as the stable
active site structures, wherein the
geometry-isolated and electron-
rich Pt in [PtZn4] ensembles readily
promotes desorption of surface-
bounded propylene and improves
the stability by prohibiting coke
side reactions.

deactivation. The development of highly efficient and stable SACs, therefore, re-
mains grand challenges in the field of alkane dehydrogenation at elevated
temperatures.
Atomically ordered Pt1M1 intermetallic alloy (IMA) (molar ratio of Pt/M = 1) contains
one active metal Pt and another inert component M, which can disperse the active
sites into the isolated Pt1 site by the neighboring M atoms.11,22,23 Additionally,
this highly ordered crystalline structure provides active sites with higher thermal sta-
bility compared with conventional single-atom alloys.11 For example, PtZn IMA has
been reported in ethane dehydrogenation.24 However, the loading of Pt is relatively
high with about 9.53 wt %, which is far higher than that of the industrial Pt-based cat-
alysts with the Pt loading of about 0.3 wt % in PtSn/Al2O3. This induces low olefin
productivity and atom utilization. Recently, novel preparation methods have been
developed to improve the propylene productivity by constructing ultrasmall PtZn
bimetal nanoclusters by embedding them inside S-1 zeolites.25,26 However, due
to the very complex coordination structures in zeolites, e.g., the coexistence of
PtO, PtPt, and PtZn coordinations, it is very difficult to identify the active site
structures, regardless of experimental and theoretical simulations. Therefore,
further revealing the unclear active site structures and promoting propylene produc-
tivity is highly desired.
This paper describes a selective and ultrastable single-site [PtZn4] catalyst by assem-
bling atomically ordered PtZn IMA with trace Pt loadings of 0.1 wt %, which enables
more than 95% selectivity of propylene over a broad temperature range of 520C to
620C and the highest propylene productivity of 83.2 mol C3H6 gPt
1 h1. No
obvious deactivation was observed within 160-h under industrial operating condi-
tions, superior to PtSn/Al2O3 and state-of-the-art Pt-based catalysts. Based on in
situ X-ray absorption fine-structure spectroscopy measurements, X-ray photoelec-
tron spectroscopy measurements, and density functional theory calculations, it is
further revealed that surface [PtZn4] ensembles in Pt1Zn1 (110) serve as the stable
active site structures, wherein the geometry-isolated and electron-rich Pt in [PtZn4]
ensembles readily promote desorption of the surface-bounded propylene and
improve the stability by prohibiting coke formation and segregation of Pt and Zn
atoms via structural ordering.
RESULTS
Formation of Single-Atom Pt1 Sites in PtZn IMAs
By direct H2 temperature-programmed reduction strategy (see Experimental Pro-
cedures), we successfully constructed PtZn IMAs (molar ratio of Pt:Zn = 1) supported
on SiO2, where the H2-rich atmosphere at high temperatures (HT) of 600C contrib-
utes to the transformation of disordered PtZn nanoparticles (NPs) into structurally or-
dered PtZn IMAs (Figure 1A).27 We monitored the formation and transformation
from Pt to PtZn IMAs by X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns at different reduction tem-
peratures (Figure S1). After 600C reduction, a set of new diffraction peaks (31.1,
40.8, and 44.8) appeared, which are ascribed to (110), (111), and (200), respec-
tively, corresponding well with the standard PXRD patterns (PDF#06-0604) of inter-
metallic Pt1Zn1 (P4/mmm) (Figure 1C).24,27 This is definitely different from the diffrac-
tion peaks (39.8, 46.2), which are ascribed to (111) and (200) of Pt (Fm3m) (PDF#04-
0802). Notably, the crystalline phase has been transformed from the face-centered
cubic (fcc) of Pt to body-centered tetragonal (bct) Pt1Zn1 IMA (Figure 1B). The
average particle sizes of 0.1Pt0.17Zn alloy (additions of 0.1 wt % Pt and 0.17 wt %
Zn) supported on SiO2 significantly decreased from 2.1 nm (0.1Pt/SiO2, additions

ure S2). Aberration-corrected high-angle annular dark-field scanning transmission
electron microscope (AC-HAADF-STEM) imaging (Figure 1E and S3) revealed the
formation of atomically ordered PtZn IMAs, featuring the alternating bright Pt col-
umn and dark Zn column contrast on [110] planes (Figure 1E). Energy dispersive
spectrometry (EDS) elemental mappings of the PtZn nanoparticle indicated the ho-
mogeneous distribution of Pt and Zn atoms (Figure 1G) with an approximately 1:1
ratio. Considering that the Zn content in this PtZn nanoparticle is lower than those
fed in the catalyst (1 wt % Pt and 1.7 wt % Zn), a part of Zn may present on SiO2 sup-
port. The fast Fourier transform (FFT) image of the PtZn nanoparticle in Figure 1E
shows the superlattice diffraction patterns, which further implies the formation of

ordered Pt1Zn1 IMAs (Figure 1F). The atomic plane distances were measured as
0.286 nm, agreeing with a lattice spacing of intermetallic Pt1Zn1 along with the
[110] directions, which implies the highly exposed (110) facets in these PtZn IMAs.
At the surface of PtZn (110), the [PtZn4] ensembles (rectangle-framed motif) period-
ically formed, in which Pt atom was isolated by 4 neighboring Zn atoms, leading to
the formation of single-atom Pt1 site. Comparatively, for Pt/SiO2, AC-HAADF-STEM
imaging (Figure S4) showed that two atomic plane distances were measured as
0.229 and 0.199 nm (Figure 1H), which were in agreement with the lattice spacing
along the [111] and [200] directions. On the surface of Pt (111), the [Pt3] ensembles
(triangle-framed motif) periodically formed (Figure 1J), indicating the formation of
surface Pt3 sites over Pt/SiO2.
To further obtain information about different surface Pt ensembles over Pt/SiO2 and
PtZn/SiO2, we performed Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy with CO
adsorption. For Pt/SiO2, one CO adsorption peak appeared in CO-diffuse reflec-
tance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy (DRIFTS) (Figure S5) at 2,075 cm1,
which was assigned to stretching vibration of CO adsorbed on Pt ensembles with
on-top modes. Comparatively, for PtZn/SiO2, upon the increase of reduction
temperatures,
the

ensembles
(2,075 cm1) disappeared with an appearance of a new band feature at around
2,047 cm1 (Figure S6). Noticeably, no position changes of this band was observed
with the decrease of CO coverage during the 60 min purge (Figure 1D), indicating
that the band at 2,047 cm1 might have been assigned to the on-top CO adsorbed
on the single-atom Pt1 site.28,29 These results clearly demonstrate the formation of a
single-atom Pt1 site in PtZn IMAs supported on SiO2.
Catalytic Performance and Stability
Kinetic studies of the catalysts showed that H2 response in terms of the rate-deter-
mining initial CH cleavage in C3H8 temperature-programmed surface reaction
(TPSR) starts at about 181C on Pt/SiO2, 214C on PtZn/SiO2, and 500C on Zn/
SiO2, respectively (Figure S7), revealing that the Pt atom might serve as the active
component and Zn functions as the promoter, which slightly increases the CH acti-
vation temperature. The formation of CH4 as a result of cracking and coke side reac-
tions at HT was significantly inhibited with the addition of Zn over PtZn/SiO2, which
might signify the higher propylene selectivity and anti-coke resistance. According to
Pt dispersions (Figure S8) and specific activity at 600C, the calculated turnover fre-
quency (TOF)C3H6 (6.8 s1) over PtZn/SiO2 was much higher than that over Pt/SiO2
(4.6 s1) (Table S1), suggesting the superior ability of propylene production over
PtZn/SiO2 than Pt/SiO2.
When testing for PDH, we evaluated the influence of Pt and Zn additions, H2 pres-
sures, weight hourly velocity (WHSV) of propane, and reaction temperatures on pro-
pane conversion and propylene selectivity. As a result, increasing Zn additions and
H2 pressures contribute to the improvement of propylene selectivity (Figures S9 and
S10). Increasing Pt loadings (Figure S11) and reaction temperatures (Figure S12) in-
creases the conversion of propane, while higher WHSV of propane (Figure S13) leads
to the loss of conversion. Optimally, the PtZn/SiO2 with a low loading of 0.1 wt % Pt
and 0.17 wt % Zn obtained about 48% of propane conversion and 96% of propylene
selectivity at 600C and WHSV of propane = 4 h1 (C3H8/H2 = 1/1), which is signif-
icantly higher than that over Pt/SiO2 (42% conversion, 67% selectivity) (Figure 2A)
and Zn/SiO2 (4% conversion, 60% selectivity) (Figure S14). In addition, supports
could influence the structures of PtZn alloys and thus dehydrogenation performance.
We found that PtZn supported on SiO2 exhibited better both propane conversion

and propylene selectivity than Al2O3 (Figure S15), despite the similar sizes of PtZn
particles (Figure S16). The reason may be that SiO2 interacts weakly with the metals,
allowing for a greater extent of metal interaction and alloying between Pt and Zn,
which may be the significant support effect for the IMA formation.22,30 Conse-
quently, there was a lower CO adsorption band position (2,047 cm1) over PtZn/
SiO2 than that over PtZn/Al2O3 (2,069 cm1) (Figure S5). Additionally, the stronger
acidity of Al2O3 supports than SiO2 (Figure S17A) would lead to coking and catalyst
deactivation. Raman spectra of the spent catalysts (Figures S17B and S17C) further
indicated that the coke amount and graphitization degree (the calculated ratio of ID/
IG) of PtZn/SiO2 was significantly lower than that over PtZn/Al2O3. Therefore, the
weak acid SiO2 in this work was selected as a support to promote the formation of
highly alloying PtZn IMA and suppress the influence of support acidity on coking
behaviors.
Consequently, SiO2-supported PtZn IMAs showed ascendant temperature tolerance
ranging from 520C to 620C, enabling over 95% selectivity of C3H6 (Figure 2B), indi-
cating superior selectivity of this PtZn IMA during the wide range of HTs. Moreover,
the PtZn IMA catalysts ran more than 160 and 100 h of continuous operation with lit-
tle deactivation at 520C (Figure S18) and 575C (Figure S19), respectively. To
further evaluate the stability of this PtZn IMA catalyst, we performed the long-term
test under industrial operating conditions (600C, WHSV of C3H8=11 h1, C3H8/
