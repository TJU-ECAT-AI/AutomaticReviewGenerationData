[1] "A change of feedstock from naphtha to light alkanes, due to the emergence of shale gas and the increasing availability of natural gas, has led to an increasing development of on-purpose propane dehydrogenation (PDH) technologies."

[2] "PDH is an extremely energy-intensive process largely due to the high positive enthalpy of the reactions (DrH = 124 kJ mol1), necessitating high reaction temperatures,46 which presents grand challenges for alkene selectivity and catalyst stability."

The growing demand for propylene has led to the development of on-purpose propane dehydrogenation (PDH) technologies. This shift has been driven by changes in feedstock availability, particularly the emergence of shale gas and increased natural gas supplies, which have made light alkanes more accessible compared to traditional naphtha feedstocks.

PDH has emerged as an important technology for propylene production, but it faces significant challenges. The process is highly energy-intensive due to the endothermic nature of the reaction, requiring high temperatures. These high temperatures create difficulties in maintaining alkene selectivity and catalyst stability.

The literature does not provide specific information about Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts for PDH, the debate about active Ga species, or recent research findings related to these catalysts. Therefore, this part of the question cannot be answered based on the given information.

<ChineseVersionAnswer>

丙烯需求的增长推动了定向丙烷脱氢(PDH)技术的发展。这一转变是由原料供应的变化所驱动的，特别是页岩气的出现和天然气供应的增加，使得轻烷烃比传统的石脑油原料更容易获得。

PDH已成为丙烯生产的重要技术，但它面临着重大挑战。由于反应的吸热性质，这个过程需要高温，因此能源消耗很大。这些高温条件给保持烯烃选择性和催化剂稳定性带来了困难。

文献中没有提供关于Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂用于PDH的具体信息，也没有涉及活性Ga物种的争论，或与这些催化剂相关的最新研究发现。因此，基于给定的信息无法回答问题的这一部分。
