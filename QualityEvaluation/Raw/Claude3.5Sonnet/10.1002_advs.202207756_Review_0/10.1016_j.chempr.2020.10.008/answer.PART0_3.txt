The growing demand for propylene has led to the development of on-purpose propane dehydrogenation (PDH) technologies. This shift has been driven by changes in feedstock from naphtha to light alkanes, due to increased availability of shale gas and natural gas. PDH is an energy-intensive process requiring high reaction temperatures, which poses challenges for alkene selectivity and catalyst stability. To address these issues, researchers have focused on active site isolation strategies.

The literature does not provide specific information about Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts for PDH, the debate about active Ga species, or recent research findings related to these catalysts. Therefore, this part of the question cannot be answered based on the given text.

丙烯需求的增长推动了新的生产方法的发展，特别是丙烷脱氢(PDH)技术。这种转变是由于页岩气和天然气供应增加，导致原料从石脑油转向轻烷烃。PDH是一个高能耗过程，需要高反应温度，这对烯烃选择性和催化剂稳定性带来了挑战。为解决这些问题，研究人员集中于活性位点隔离策略。

文献中没有提供关于Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂用于PDH的具体信息，也没有涉及活性Ga物种的争论或相关的最新研究发现。因此，问题的这一部分无法根据给定的文本回答。
