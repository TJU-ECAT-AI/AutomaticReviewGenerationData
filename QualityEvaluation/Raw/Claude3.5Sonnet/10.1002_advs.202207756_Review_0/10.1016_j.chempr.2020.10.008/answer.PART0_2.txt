[1] "A change of feedstock from naphtha to light alkanes, due to the emergence of shale gas and the increasing availability of natural gas, has led to an increasing development of on-purpose propane dehydrogenation (PDH) technologies."

[2] "PDH is an extremely energy-intensive process largely due to the high positive enthalpy of the reactions (DrH = 124 kJ mol1), necessitating high reaction temperatures, which presents grand challenges for alkene selectivity and catalyst stability."

The growing demand for propylene has led to the development of on-purpose propane dehydrogenation (PDH) technologies. This shift has been driven by changes in feedstock availability, particularly the increased access to light alkanes from shale gas and natural gas. PDH has emerged as an important method for propylene production, but it faces challenges due to its energy-intensive nature and the high temperatures required, which can negatively impact alkene selectivity and catalyst stability.

The literature does not provide information about Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts for PDH, the debate about active Ga species, or recent research findings related to these catalysts. Therefore, this part of the question cannot be answered based on the given text.

丙烯需求的增长推动了定向丙烷脱氢(PDH)技术的发展。这一转变主要由原料供应的变化驱动，特别是页岩气和天然气中轻烃的可获得性增加。PDH已成为丙烯生产的重要方法，但由于其能源密集型特性和所需的高温，面临着挑战，这可能会对烯烃选择性和催化剂稳定性产生负面影响。

文献中没有提供关于Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂用于PDH的信息，也没有涉及活性Ga物种的争论，或与这些催化剂相关的最新研究发现。因此，基于给定的文本无法回答问题的这一部分。
