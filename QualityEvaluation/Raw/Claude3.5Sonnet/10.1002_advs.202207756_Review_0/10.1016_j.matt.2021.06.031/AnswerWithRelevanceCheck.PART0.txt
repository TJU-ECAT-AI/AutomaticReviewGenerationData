          The literature indicates that propane dehydrogenation (PDH) has become an important method for producing propylene directly. Recent research has focused on improving the performance of PDH processes, aiming for better propane conversion, higher propylene selectivity, and increased durability. However, the document does not provide specific information about the growing demand for propylene, the evolution of Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts, the debate about active Ga species, or recent research findings related to these catalysts. The information provided is limited and does not fully address all aspects of the question.
