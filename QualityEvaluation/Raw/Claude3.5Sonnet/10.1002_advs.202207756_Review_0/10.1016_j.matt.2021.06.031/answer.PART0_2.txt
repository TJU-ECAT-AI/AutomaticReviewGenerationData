The literature provides limited information to fully answer the question. However, it does indicate that propane dehydrogenation (PDH) has become an important method for producing propylene directly. The text mentions that PDH is a "promising and booming method," suggesting there has been growing interest in this production technique. Recent research has focused on improving the PDH process, aiming for high performance in terms of propane conversion, propylene selectivity, and durability.

The document does not provide specific information about Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts, the debate about active Ga species, or recent research findings related to these catalysts. Therefore, these aspects of the question cannot be answered based solely on the given literature.
