The literature indicates that propane dehydrogenation (PDH) has become an important method for producing propylene directly. Recent research has focused on improving the PDH process to achieve better performance in terms of propane conversion, propylene selectivity, and durability. However, the document does not provide specific information about the growing demand for propylene, the development of Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts, or the debate about active Ga species. The literature lacks detailed information to fully answer the question about the evolution of understanding these catalysts or recent research findings.
