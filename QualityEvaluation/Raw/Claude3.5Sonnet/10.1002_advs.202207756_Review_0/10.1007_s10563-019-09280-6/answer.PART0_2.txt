[1] "Figure1 illustrates the propylene production capacity of the main technologies and their contribution in bridging the demand supply gap [1]."

[2] "The traditional routes accounted for 81% propylene production (with 50% from steam cracking and 31% from FCC), while the on-purpose technologies like propane dehydrogenation contributed 19%."

[3] "The recent trend in steam crackers has been the use of ethane-based feeds which guarantee a bigger yield of ethylene, with far less propylene being produced as a by-product. Therefore there is expected to be a shortage of propylene, and therefore, there is need to look for alternative methods and technologies to increase the propylene yield to address forecasted supply and demand imbalance."

The growing demand for propylene has led to the development of new production methods, particularly on-purpose technologies like propane dehydrogenation (PDH). Traditional routes like steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) accounted for 81% of propylene production, while on-purpose technologies like PDH contributed 19%. The shift towards ethane-based feeds in steam crackers has resulted in higher ethylene yields but lower propylene production as a by-product. This trend is expected to create a shortage of propylene, necessitating the development of alternative methods and technologies to increase propylene yield and address the forecasted supply-demand imbalance.

The literature does not provide specific information about the evolution of understanding Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts for PDH, the ongoing debate about active Ga species, or recent research findings related to these catalysts. Therefore, this part of the question cannot be answered based on the given information.

丙烯需求的增长推动了新生产方法的发展，特别是像丙烷脱氢(PDH)这样的定向技术。传统路线如蒸汽裂解和流化催化裂化(FCC)占丙烯生产的81%，而像PDH这样的定向技术贡献了19%。蒸汽裂解装置转向以乙烷为基础的原料导致乙烯产量更高，但作为副产品的丙烯产量较低。这一趋势预计将造成丙烯短缺，因此需要开发替代方法和技术来增加丙烯产量，以解决预测的供需失衡问题。

文献中没有提供关于Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂在PDH中的理解演变、关于活性Ga物种的持续争论或与这些催化剂相关的最新研究发现的具体信息。因此，根据所给信息无法回答问题的这一部分。
