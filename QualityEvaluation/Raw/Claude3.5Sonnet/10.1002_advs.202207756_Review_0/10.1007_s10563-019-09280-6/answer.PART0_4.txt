[1] "Propylene is usually obtained as by-product from steam crackers and FCC units which produce with mainly ethylene and gasoline, respectively. The type of feedstock used in steam crackers affect the yield of propylene. While heavy feeds produce more propylene, lighter feeds tend to produce less propylene, as illustrated in Table1 [2]."

[2] "The recent trend in steam crackers has been the use of ethane-based feeds which guarantee a bigger yield of ethylene, with far less propylene being produced as a by-product. Therefore there is expected to be a shortage of propylene, and therefore, there is need to look for alternative methods and technologies to increase the propylene yield to address forecasted supply and demand imbalance."

[3] "The traditional routes accounted for 81% propylene production (with 50% from steam cracking and 31% from FCC), while the on-purpose technologies like propane dehydrogenation contributed 19%."

The growing demand for propylene has led to the development of new production methods, particularly on-purpose technologies like propane dehydrogenation (PDH). This is driven by the shift towards lighter feedstocks in traditional production routes, especially steam crackers, which has resulted in reduced propylene yields. 

The use of ethane-based feeds in steam crackers has increased ethylene production but decreased propylene production as a by-product. This trend has created an expected shortage of propylene, necessitating the development of alternative methods to increase propylene yield and address the forecasted supply-demand imbalance.

While traditional routes like steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) still account for the majority of propylene production (81%), on-purpose technologies like PDH have emerged as significant contributors, accounting for 19% of production. This indicates the growing importance of these new technologies in meeting the increasing demand for propylene.

The literature does not provide specific information about the evolution of understanding Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts for PDH or recent research findings related to these catalysts. Therefore, I cannot comment on the ongoing debate about active Ga species or recent contributions to our knowledge of these catalysts based on the given information.

丙烯需求的增长推动了新生产方法的发展，特别是目的性技术如丙烷脱氢(PDH)。这是由于传统生产路线，尤其是蒸汽裂解装置转向使用轻质原料，导致丙烯产量减少。

蒸汽裂解装置使用乙烷基原料增加了乙烯产量，但作为副产品的丙烯产量却下降了。这一趋势预计会造成丙烯短缺，因此需要开发替代方法来增加丙烯产量，以解决预期的供需不平衡。

虽然蒸汽裂解和流化催化裂化(FCC)等传统路线仍然占丙烯生产的大部分(81%)，但PDH等目的性技术已经成为重要的贡献者，占生产的19%。这表明这些新技术在满足日益增长的丙烯需求方面越来越重要。

文献中没有提供关于Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂在PDH中的理解演变或与这些催化剂相关的最新研究发现的具体信息。因此，基于给定的信息，我无法评论关于活性Ga物种的持续争论或最近对这些催化剂知识的贡献。
