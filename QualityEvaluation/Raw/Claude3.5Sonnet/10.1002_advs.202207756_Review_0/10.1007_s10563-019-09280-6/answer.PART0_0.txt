[1] "The traditional route for light olefins production is steam cracking (SC) furnaces and fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) reactors. Figure1 illustrates the propylene production capacity of the main technologies and their contribution in bridging the demand supply gap [1]."

[2] "The traditional routes accounted for 81% propylene production (with 50% from steam cracking and 31% from FCC), while the on-purpose technologies like propane dehydrogenation contributed 19%."

[3] "Therefore, alternative technologies have to be developed to produce more propylene to make up for the shortfall from steam cracking."

The growing demand for propylene has led to the development of new production methods, including propane dehydrogenation (PDH). Traditional routes like steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) still account for the majority of propylene production (81%), but on-purpose technologies like PDH are gaining importance, contributing 19% of production. This shift is driven by the need to address the shortfall in propylene production from traditional methods, particularly as steam cracking shifts towards lighter, ethane-based feeds that produce less propylene.

The literature provided does not contain specific information about the evolution of understanding Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts for PDH, the debate about active Ga species, or recent research findings related to these catalysts. Therefore, this part of the question cannot be answered based on the given text.

丙烯需求的增长推动了新生产方法的发展，包括丙烷脱氢(PDH)。传统路线如蒸汽裂解和流化催化裂化(FCC)仍然占丙烯生产的大部分(81%)，但像PDH这样的定向技术正变得越来越重要，贡献了19%的产量。这种转变是由于需要解决传统方法丙烯产量不足的问题，特别是随着蒸汽裂解转向产生较少丙烯的轻质乙烷基原料。

提供的文献中没有包含关于Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂在PDH中的理解演变、活性Ga物种的争论或与这些催化剂相关的最新研究发现的具体信息。因此，基于给定的文本无法回答问题的这一部分。
