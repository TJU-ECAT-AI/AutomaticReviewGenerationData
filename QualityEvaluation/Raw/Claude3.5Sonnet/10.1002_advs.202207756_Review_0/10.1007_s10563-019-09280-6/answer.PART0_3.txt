[1] "The traditional routes accounted for 81% propylene production (with 50% from steam cracking and 31% from FCC), while the on-purpose technologies like propane dehydrogenation contributed 19%."

[2] "Therefore, alternative technologies have to be developed to produce more propylene to make up for the shortfall from steam cracking."

[3] "The shift to lighter, ethane-based feeds means that propylene production from steam crackers will be lower than the corresponding ethylene production."

The growing demand for propylene has led to the development of alternative production methods, particularly on-purpose technologies like propane dehydrogenation (PDH). This is due to the shift towards lighter, ethane-based feeds in traditional steam crackers, which has resulted in lower propylene production compared to ethylene. While steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) still account for the majority of propylene production (81%), on-purpose technologies like PDH have emerged to contribute 19% of the production. These alternative technologies aim to address the shortfall in propylene production from traditional methods and meet the increasing demand.

The literature provided does not contain specific information about Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts for PDH, the debate about active Ga species, or recent research findings related to these catalysts. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to that part of the question based on the given information.

丙烯需求的增长推动了替代生产方法的发展，特别是像丙烷脱氢(PDH)这样的定向技术。这是由于传统蒸汽裂解装置转向使用较轻的乙烷基原料，导致丙烯产量相对于乙烯产量较低。虽然蒸汽裂解和流化催化裂化(FCC)仍然占丙烯生产的大部分(81%)，但像PDH这样的定向技术已经出现，贡献了19%的产量。这些替代技术旨在解决传统方法丙烯生产不足的问题，满足不断增长的需求。

所提供的文献中没有包含关于Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂用于PDH、活性Ga物种的争论或与这些催化剂相关的最新研究发现的具体信息。因此，我无法根据给定的信息回答问题的这一部分。
