[1] "The traditional routes accounted for 81% propylene production (with 50% from steam cracking and 31% from FCC), while the on-purpose technologies like propane dehydrogenation contributed 19%."

[2] "Propylene is usually obtained as by-product from steam crackers and FCC units which produce with mainly ethylene and gasoline, respectively. The type of feedstock used in steam crackers affect the yield of propylene. While heavy feeds produce more propylene, lighter feeds tend to produce less propylene, as illustrated in Table1 [2]."

[3] "The recent trend in steam crackers has been the use of ethane-based feeds which guarantee a bigger yield of ethylene, with far less propylene being produced as a by-product. Therefore there is expected to be a shortage of propylene, and therefore, there is need to look for alternative methods and technologies to increase the propylene yield to address forecasted supply and demand imbalance."

The growing demand for propylene has significantly influenced the development of new production methods, particularly propane dehydrogenation (PDH). This shift is primarily driven by the changing landscape of traditional propylene production methods. Steam crackers and fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) units, which historically accounted for the majority of propylene production, are increasingly using lighter feedstocks like ethane. This trend results in higher ethylene yields but significantly reduces propylene production as a by-product.

To address the anticipated propylene shortage, the industry has turned to on-purpose technologies like PDH. These technologies are designed specifically to produce propylene, helping to bridge the gap between supply and demand. The development of PDH has been crucial in diversifying propylene production sources and reducing dependence on traditional by-product streams.

However, the literature provided does not contain specific information about Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts for PDH, the debate about active Ga species, or recent research findings related to these catalysts. Therefore, I cannot provide information on the evolution of understanding regarding these specific catalysts or recent research contributions in this area based on the given text.

丙烯需求的增长显著影响了新生产方法的发展，特别是丙烷脱氢（PDH）技术。这种转变主要是由传统丙烯生产方法格局的变化驱动的。蒸汽裂解装置和流化催化裂化（FCC）装置历来是丙烯生产的主要来源，但它们越来越多地使用乙烷等轻质原料。这一趋势导致乙烯产量增加，但作为副产品的丙烯产量显著减少。

为了解决预期的丙烯短缺问题，行业转向了以PDH为代表的定向生产技术。这些技术专门设计用于生产丙烯，有助于弥合供需差距。PDH的发展对于丙烯生产来源的多样化和减少对传统副产品流的依赖至关重要。

然而，提供的文献中并未包含关于Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂用于PDH的具体信息，也没有涉及活性Ga物种的争论或与这些催化剂相关的最新研究发现。因此，基于给定的文本，我无法提供关于这些特定催化剂的理解演变或该领域最新研究贡献的信息。
