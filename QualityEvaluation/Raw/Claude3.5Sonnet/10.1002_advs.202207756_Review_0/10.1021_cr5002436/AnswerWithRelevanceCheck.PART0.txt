          [1] "The demand of these building blocks has increased steadily over the last years, all major markets registering a positive growth in demand and production in recent years with the exception of the Eurozone, due to the effects of the recent economic downturn."

[2] "Consequently, the recent boom in shale gas production has turned the United States into the lowest cost chemical producer outside the Middle East, as illustrated by the 126 investment projects totaling 84 billion dollars made up to September 2013 that have been tallied by the American Chemistry Council."

[3] "As of this writing, ca. 5 million tons of propylene is produced annually by propane dehydrogenation (PDH). However, this number is expected to increase significantly in the upcoming years as dozens of new PDH installations have been announced worldwide, and many of these installations are already under construction."

[4] "The exact nature of the active sites in Ga-based dehydrogenation catalysts is still under debate."

[5] "β-Ga2O3 has a monoclinic structure, in which gallium atoms are equally distributed between tetrahedral and octahedral configurations. This crystal structure has a high concentration of weak Lewis acid sites (coordinatively unsaturated tetrahedral ones on the surface of the material), which are deemed to be centers of dehydrogenation activity."

[6] "Several authors have performed DFT calculations in an effort to understand the dehydrogenation reaction mechanism on Ga2O3."

[7] "Murata and co-workers have observed an increase in activity after a prereduction step with hydrogen at 550 C, while a simultaneous increase of Gaδ+H and GaOH sites was observed via NH3 TPD. These authors proposed that these sites also form during reaction and may be responsible for the dehydrogenation activity of the silica supported Ga2O3 catalyst."

[8] "Chen et al., who, by relating the results of NH3-TPD measurements with activity data for different GaxAl10xO15 mixed oxides, showed that a high concentration of Lewis acid groups in the form of coordinatively unsaturated tetrahedral Ga3+ cations is a prerequisite for dehydrogenation activity"

          The growing demand for propylene has significantly influenced the development of new production methods, particularly propane dehydrogenation (PDH). This trend is driven by:

1. Steady increase in demand for propylene across major markets.
2. The shale gas boom in the United States, making it a low-cost chemical producer.
3. Current annual production of about 5 million tons of propylene through PDH, with expectations of significant growth due to new installations worldwide.

The understanding of Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts for PDH has evolved, but debates about active Ga species continue:

1. The exact nature of active sites in Ga-based dehydrogenation catalysts is still under debate.
2. β-Ga2O3's monoclinic structure, with weak Lewis acid sites, is considered important for dehydrogenation activity.
3. DFT calculations have been performed to understand the reaction mechanism on Ga2O3.
4. Recent research has observed increased activity after hydrogen prereduction, with an increase in Gaδ+H and GaOH sites.
5. Studies have linked a high concentration of Lewis acid groups, specifically coordinatively unsaturated tetrahedral Ga3+ cations, to dehydrogenation activity.

These developments contribute to a deeper, though still evolving, understanding of Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts for PDH.

          丙烯需求的增长显著影响了新生产方法的发展，特别是丙烷脱氢（PDH）。这一趋势由以下因素驱动：

1. 主要市场对丙烯的需求稳步增长。
2. 美国页岩气繁荣，使其成为低成本化学品生产国。
3. 目前通过PDH每年生产约500万吨丙烯，预计随着全球新装置的建设而显著增长。

对Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂在PDH中的理解虽然有所发展，但关于活性Ga物种的争论仍在继续：

1. Ga基脱氢催化剂中活性位点的确切性质仍有争议。
2. β-Ga2O3的单斜结构，具有弱Lewis酸位点，被认为对脱氢活性很重要。
3. 已进行DFT计算以理解Ga2O3上的反应机理。
4. 最近的研究观察到，在氢气预还原后活性增加，同时Gaδ+H和GaOH位点增加。
5. 研究将高浓度的Lewis酸基团，特别是配位不饱和的四面体Ga3+阳离子，与脱氢活性联系起来。

这些发展为Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂在PDH中的应用提供了更深入但仍在不断发展的理解。
