The growing demand for propylene has significantly influenced the development of new production methods, particularly propane dehydrogenation (PDH). The demand for light olefins, including propylene, has been steadily increasing in recent years across major markets. This increase, coupled with the shale gas boom in the United States, has led to substantial investments in the chemical industry, making the U.S. one of the lowest-cost chemical producers outside the Middle East.

As a result, propane dehydrogenation has gained importance as a production method for propylene. Currently, about 5 million tons of propylene are produced annually through PDH, but this number is expected to increase significantly in the coming years. Numerous new PDH installations have been announced worldwide, with many already under construction.

The understanding of Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts for PDH has evolved over time, but there is still ongoing debate about the active Ga species. While some research suggests that isolated Zn2+ species with tetrahedral orientation are the active sites in Zn-based catalysts (which have a similar reaction mechanism to Ga-based catalysts), the exact nature of the active sites in Ga-based dehydrogenation catalysts remains under debate.

Recent research has contributed to our current knowledge of these catalysts. It has been found that β-Ga2O3, which has a monoclinic structure with gallium atoms distributed between tetrahedral and octahedral configurations, possesses a high concentration of weak Lewis acid sites. These coordinatively unsaturated tetrahedral sites on the surface of the material are believed to be the centers of dehydrogenation activity. However, more research is needed to fully understand the complex nature of the active sites in Ga-based PDH catalysts.

丙烯需求的增长显著影响了新生产方法的发展，特别是丙烷脱氢(PDH)。近年来，包括丙烯在内的轻烯烃需求在主要市场稳步增长。这种增长，加上美国页岩气的繁荣，导致了化学工业的大量投资，使美国成为中东以外成本最低的化学品生产国之一。

因此，丙烷脱氢作为丙烯的生产方法变得越来越重要。目前，通过PDH每年生产约500万吨丙烯，但预计这个数字在未来几年将显著增加。全球已宣布了许多新的PDH装置，其中许多已经在建设中。

对Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂在PDH中的理解随时间而演变，但关于活性Ga物种的争论仍在继续。虽然一些研究表明，四面体取向的孤立Zn2+物种是Zn基催化剂的活性位点（其反应机理与Ga基催化剂相似），但Ga基脱氢催化剂中活性位点的确切性质仍存在争议。

最新研究为我们对这些催化剂的认知做出了贡献。研究发现，β-Ga2O3具有单斜结构，其中镓原子在四面体和八面体构型之间均匀分布，具有高浓度的弱Lewis酸位点。这些位于材料表面的配位不饱和四面体位点被认为是脱氢活性的中心。然而，要完全理解Ga基PDH催化剂中活性位点的复杂性质，还需要进行更多的研究。
