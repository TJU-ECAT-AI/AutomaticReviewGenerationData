[1] "The demand of these building blocks has increased steadily over the last years, all major markets registering a positive growth in demand and production in recent years with the exception of the Eurozone, due to the effects of the recent economic downturn."

[2] "Consequently, the recent boom in shale gas production has turned the United States into the lowest cost chemical producer outside the Middle East, as illustrated by the 126 investment projects totaling 84 billion dollars made up to September 2013 that have been tallied by the American Chemistry Council."

[3] "As of this writing, ca. 5 million tons of propylene is produced annually by propane dehydrogenation (PDH). However, this number is expected to increase significantly in the upcoming years as dozens of new PDH installations have been announced worldwide, and many of these installations are already under construction."

[4] "Notably, there is a similarly advantageous market situation for the dehydrogenation of butanes, because the same conditions apply. Increased demand, especially from the automotive industry, combined with a decrease in supply due to the high cost of naphtha cracking, has resulted in sharp increases in butadiene prices."

[5] "The exact nature of the active sites in Ga-based dehydrogenation catalysts is still under debate. Akin to Al2O3, Ga2O3 has different polymorphs of which β-Ga2O3 is not only the most stable, but also the most active Ga species in PDH according to some authors."

[6] "Several authors have performed DFT calculations in an effort to understand the dehydrogenation reaction mechanism on Ga2O3. Studies by Liu et al. regarding propane dehydrogenation on a perfect Ga2O3 (100) surface revealed that the CH bond is activated by a surface oxygen that abstracts an hydrogen from the propane molecule, thus forming a propyl species, which coordinates with a Ga surface site and a hydroxyl group."

The growing demand for propylene has significantly influenced the development of new production methods, particularly propane dehydrogenation (PDH). The steady increase in demand for light olefins, combined with the recent boom in shale gas production, has made PDH an economically attractive option. As a result, the annual production of propylene through PDH has reached about 5 million tons, with expectations of significant growth in the coming years due to numerous new PDH installations being announced and constructed worldwide.

The understanding of Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts for PDH has evolved over time, but there is still ongoing debate about the active Ga species. Some researchers consider β-Ga2O3 to be not only the most stable but also the most active Ga species in PDH. However, the exact nature of the active sites in Ga-based dehydrogenation catalysts remains a subject of discussion.

Recent research findings have contributed to our current knowledge of these catalysts through various approaches, including DFT calculations. For instance, studies on propane dehydrogenation on a perfect Ga2O3 (100) surface have revealed insights into the reaction mechanism. These calculations suggest that the C-H bond is activated by a surface oxygen, which abstracts a hydrogen from the propane molecule, forming a propyl species that coordinates with a Ga surface site and a hydroxyl group.

Despite these advancements, there is still no consensus on the precise nature and behavior of the active Ga species in PDH catalysts. The ongoing research in this area continues to provide new insights and refine our understanding of these catalytic systems.

丙烯需求的增长显著影响了新生产方法的发展，特别是丙烷脱氢(PDH)。轻烯烃需求的稳定增长，加上页岩气生产的最近繁荣，使PDH成为一个经济上具有吸引力的选择。因此，通过PDH生产的丙烯年产量已达到约500万吨，由于全球范围内宣布和建设的众多新PDH装置，预计在未来几年将显著增长。

对Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂在PDH中的理解随时间不断演变，但关于活性Ga物种仍存在争议。一些研究人员认为β-Ga2O3不仅是最稳定的，而且是PDH中最活跃的Ga物种。然而，基于Ga的脱氢催化剂中活性位点的确切性质仍然是讨论的主题。

近期研究发现通过各种方法，包括DFT计算，为我们对这些催化剂的当前认知做出了贡献。例如，关于在完美Ga2O3(100)表面上丙烷脱氢的研究揭示了反应机理的见解。这些计算表明，C-H键被表面氧活化，从丙烷分子中提取氢原子，形成与Ga表面位点和羟基配位的丙基物种。

尽管取得了这些进展，对PDH催化剂中活性Ga物种的精确性质和行为仍然没有达成共识。该领域的持续研究继续提供新的见解，并完善我们对这些催化系统的理解。
