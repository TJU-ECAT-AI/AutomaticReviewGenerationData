[1] "The demand of these building blocks has increased steadily over the last years, all major markets registering a positive growth in demand and production in recent years with the exception of the Eurozone, due to the effects of the recent economic downturn."

[2] "Consequently, the recent boom in shale gas production has turned the United States into the lowest cost chemical producer outside the Middle East, as illustrated by the 126 investment projects totaling 84 billion dollars made up to September 2013 that have been tallied by the American Chemistry Council."

[3] "Indeed, industrial dehydrogenation processes are currently optimized in such a way that they can produce olefins of polymer-quality purity. As of this writing, ca. 5 million tons of propylene is produced annually by propane dehydrogenation (PDH)."

[4] "Halasz et al. have tested the reactivity of propane on Ga- and In-loaded ZSM-5 and found both catalysts to be active in PDH and display similar activity and selectivity values."

[5] "The exact nature of the active sites in Ga-based dehydrogenation catalysts is still under debate. Akin to Al2O3, Ga2O3 has different polymorphs of which β-Ga2O3 is not only the most stable, but also the most active Ga species in PDH according to some authors."

The growing demand for propylene has significantly influenced the development of new production methods, particularly propane dehydrogenation (PDH). This shift has been driven by several factors:

1. Steady increase in demand for propylene as a chemical building block across major markets.

2. The shale gas boom in the United States, which has made it one of the lowest-cost chemical producers outside the Middle East. This has led to substantial investments in the chemical industry.

3. The optimization of industrial dehydrogenation processes to produce polymer-quality olefins. Currently, about 5 million tons of propylene are produced annually through PDH.

The understanding of Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts for PDH has evolved over time, but there is still ongoing debate about the active Ga species. Key points in this evolution include:

1. Research has shown that Ga-loaded ZSM-5 catalysts are active in PDH, displaying similar activity and selectivity to In-loaded ZSM-5.

2. There is debate about the exact nature of the active sites in Ga-based dehydrogenation catalysts.

3. Some researchers suggest that β-Ga2O3, one of the polymorphs of Ga2O3, is not only the most stable but also the most active Ga species in PDH.

However, the field continues to evolve, and more research is needed to fully understand the role of different Ga species in PDH catalysis. The ongoing debate and research findings contribute to our current knowledge of these catalysts, highlighting the complexity of the system and the need for further investigation.

丙烯需求的增长显著影响了新生产方法的发展，特别是丙烷脱氢(PDH)。这种转变由几个因素驱动：

1. 作为化学原料的丙烯在主要市场的需求稳步增长。

2. 美国页岩气的繁荣，使其成为中东以外成本最低的化学品生产国。这导致了化工行业的大量投资。

3. 工业脱氢工艺的优化，以生产聚合物级纯度的烯烃。目前，通过PDH每年生产约500万吨丙烯。

对Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂在PDH中的理解随时间而演变，但对活性Ga物种仍存在争议。这一演变的关键点包括：

1. 研究表明，Ga负载的ZSM-5催化剂在PDH中具有活性，显示出与In负载的ZSM-5相似的活性和选择性。

2. 关于Ga基脱氢催化剂中活性位点的确切性质仍存在争议。

3. 一些研究人员认为，Ga2O3的多晶型之一β-Ga2O3不仅是最稳定的，而且在PDH中也是最活跃的Ga物种。

然而，这个领域仍在不断发展，需要更多研究来充分理解不同Ga物种在PDH催化中的作用。持续的争论和研究发现为我们对这些催化剂的当前认知做出了贡献，突显了该系统的复杂性和进一步研究的必要性。
