[1] "The demand of these building blocks has increased steadily over the last years, all major markets registering a positive growth in demand and production in recent years with the exception of the Eurozone, due to the effects of the recent economic downturn."

[2] "Consequently, the recent boom in shale gas production has turned the United States into the lowest cost chemical producer outside the Middle East, as illustrated by the 126 investment projects totaling 84 billion dollars made up to September 2013 that have been tallied by the American Chemistry Council."

[3] "As of this writing, ca. 5 million tons of propylene is produced annually by propane dehydrogenation (PDH). However, this number is expected to increase significantly in the upcoming years as dozens of new PDH installations have been announced worldwide, and many of these installations are already under construction."

[4] "Isolated Zn2+ species with a tetrahedral orientation were deemed to be the active sites, with a reaction mechanism similar to that reported on GaOx-based dehydrogenation catalysts."

[5] "The exact nature of the active sites in Ga-based dehydrogenation catalysts is still under debate."

[6] "β-Ga2O3 has a monoclinic structure, in which gallium atoms are equally distributed between tetrahedral and octahedral configurations. This crystal structure has a high concentration of weak Lewis acid sites (coordinatively unsaturated tetrahedral ones on the surface of the material), which are deemed to be centers of dehydrogenation activity."

The growing demand for propylene has significantly influenced the development of new production methods, particularly propane dehydrogenation (PDH). The demand for light olefins, including propylene, has been steadily increasing in recent years across major markets. This increase, coupled with the shale gas boom in the United States, has led to substantial investments in the chemical industry, making the U.S. one of the lowest-cost chemical producers outside the Middle East.

As a result, propane dehydrogenation has gained importance as a production method for propylene. Currently, about 5 million tons of propylene are produced annually through PDH, but this number is expected to increase significantly in the coming years. Numerous new PDH installations have been announced worldwide, with many already under construction.

The understanding of Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts for PDH has evolved over time, but there is still ongoing debate about the active Ga species. While some research suggests that isolated Zn2+ species with tetrahedral orientation are the active sites in Zn-based catalysts (which have a similar reaction mechanism to Ga-based catalysts), the exact nature of the active sites in Ga-based dehydrogenation catalysts remains under debate.

Recent research has contributed to our current knowledge of these catalysts. It has been found that β-Ga2O3, which has a monoclinic structure with gallium atoms distributed between tetrahedral and octahedral configurations, possesses a high concentration of weak Lewis acid sites. These coordinatively unsaturated tetrahedral sites on the surface of the material are believed to be the centers of dehydrogenation activity. However, more research is needed to fully understand the complex nature of the active sites in Ga-based PDH catalysts.

丙烯需求的增长显著影响了新生产方法的发展，特别是丙烷脱氢(PDH)。近年来，包括丙烯在内的轻烯烃需求在主要市场稳步增长。这种增长，加上美国页岩气的繁荣，导致了化学工业的大量投资，使美国成为中东以外成本最低的化学品生产国之一。

因此，丙烷脱氢作为丙烯的生产方法变得越来越重要。目前，通过PDH每年生产约500万吨丙烯，但预计这个数字在未来几年将显著增加。全球已宣布了许多新的PDH装置，其中许多已经在建设中。

对Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂在PDH中的理解随时间而演变，但关于活性Ga物种的争论仍在继续。虽然一些研究表明，四面体取向的孤立Zn2+物种是Zn基催化剂的活性位点（其反应机理与Ga基催化剂相似），但Ga基脱氢催化剂中活性位点的确切性质仍存在争议。

最新研究为我们对这些催化剂的认知做出了贡献。研究发现，β-Ga2O3具有单斜结构，其中镓原子在四面体和八面体构型之间均匀分布，具有高浓度的弱Lewis酸位点。这些位于材料表面的配位不饱和四面体位点被认为是脱氢活性的中心。然而，要完全理解Ga基PDH催化剂中活性位点的复杂性质，还需要进行更多的研究。

[1] "Because of their extensive use as chemical building blocks, light olefins, such as propylene (propene) and ethylene (ethene), are among the most important types of compounds in the chemical industry."

[2] "The demand of these building blocks has increased steadily over the last years, all major markets registering a positive growth in demand and production in recent years with the exception of the Eurozone, due to the effects of the recent economic downturn."

[3] "Consequently, the recent boom in shale gas production has turned the United States into the lowest cost chemical producer outside the Middle East, as illustrated by the 126 investment projects totaling 84 billion dollars made up to September 2013 that have been tallied by the American Chemistry Council."

[4] "The high availability of these relatively cheap natural gas liquids, specifically ethane, has resulted in a shift from oil-based naphtha to shale-based ethane for steam cracking installations in the United States, with ethane crackers being constructed and naphtha crackers being either dismantled or converted. Relative to naphtha cracking, steam cracking of ethane produces a negligible amount of olefins other than ethylene, which is why the supply of propylene has dropped and its price has risen sharply, creating opportunities for on-purpose catalytic technologies, such as the catalytic dehydrogenation of light paraffins into the corresponding olefins."

[5] "Halasz et al. have tested the reactivity of propane on Ga- and In-loaded ZSM-5 and found both catalysts to be active in PDH and display similar activity and selectivity values."

[6] "The exact nature of the active sites in Ga-based dehydrogenation catalysts is still under debate."

[7] "Several authors have performed DFT calculations in an effort to understand the dehydrogenation reaction mechanism on Ga2O3."

[8] "Murata and co-workers have observed an increase in activity after a prereduction step with hydrogen at 550 C, while a simultaneous increase of Gaδ+H and GaOH sites was observed via NH3 TPD. These authors proposed that these sites also form during reaction and may be responsible for the dehydrogenation activity of the silica supported Ga2O3 catalyst."

1. Steady increase in demand for light olefins as chemical building blocks.

2. The shale gas boom in the United States, which has led to a shift from oil-based naphtha to shale-based ethane for steam cracking.

3. The resulting drop in propylene supply and sharp rise in its price, creating opportunities for on-purpose catalytic technologies like PDH.

1. Both Ga- and In-loaded ZSM-5 have been found to be active in PDH with similar activity and selectivity.

2. The exact nature of the active sites in Ga-based dehydrogenation catalysts remains under debate.

3. DFT calculations have been performed to understand the dehydrogenation reaction mechanism on Ga2O3.

4. Recent research has observed an increase in activity after a prereduction step with hydrogen, along with an increase in Gaδ+H and GaOH sites. These sites are proposed to form during the reaction and may be responsible for the dehydrogenation activity of silica-supported Ga2O3 catalysts.

Overall, while significant progress has been made in understanding Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts for PDH, there is still much to be learned about the specific active species and reaction mechanisms involved.

The growing demand for propylene has significantly influenced the development of new production methods, particularly propane dehydrogenation (PDH). The steady increase in demand for light olefins, combined with the recent boom in shale gas production, has made PDH an economically attractive option. As a result, the annual production of propylene through PDH has reached about 5 million tons, with expectations of significant growth in the coming years due to numerous new PDH installations being announced and constructed worldwide.

The understanding of Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts for PDH has evolved over time, but there is still ongoing debate about the active Ga species. Some researchers consider β-Ga2O3 to be not only the most stable but also the most active Ga species in PDH. However, the exact nature of the active sites in Ga-based dehydrogenation catalysts remains a subject of discussion.

Recent research findings have contributed to our current knowledge of these catalysts through various approaches, including DFT calculations. For instance, studies on propane dehydrogenation on a perfect Ga2O3 (100) surface have revealed insights into the reaction mechanism. These calculations suggest that the C-H bond is activated by a surface oxygen, which abstracts a hydrogen from the propane molecule, forming a propyl species that coordinates with a Ga surface site and a hydroxyl group.

Despite these advancements, there is still no consensus on the precise nature and behavior of the active Ga species in PDH catalysts. The ongoing research in this area continues to provide new insights and refine our understanding of these catalytic systems.

丙烯需求的增长显著影响了新生产方法的发展，特别是丙烷脱氢(PDH)。轻烯烃需求的稳定增长，加上页岩气生产的最近繁荣，使PDH成为一个经济上具有吸引力的选择。因此，通过PDH生产的丙烯年产量已达到约500万吨，由于全球范围内宣布和建设的众多新PDH装置，预计在未来几年将显著增长。

对Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂在PDH中的理解随时间不断演变，但关于活性Ga物种仍存在争议。一些研究人员认为β-Ga2O3不仅是最稳定的，而且是PDH中最活跃的Ga物种。然而，基于Ga的脱氢催化剂中活性位点的确切性质仍然是讨论的主题。

近期研究发现通过各种方法，包括DFT计算，为我们对这些催化剂的当前认知做出了贡献。例如，关于在完美Ga2O3(100)表面上丙烷脱氢的研究揭示了反应机理的见解。这些计算表明，C-H键被表面氧活化，从丙烷分子中提取氢原子，形成与Ga表面位点和羟基配位的丙基物种。

尽管取得了这些进展，对PDH催化剂中活性Ga物种的精确性质和行为仍然没有达成共识。该领域的持续研究继续提供新的见解，并完善我们对这些催化系统的理解。
