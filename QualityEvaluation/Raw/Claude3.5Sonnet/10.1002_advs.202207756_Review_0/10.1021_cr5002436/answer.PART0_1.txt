[1] "The demand of these building blocks has increased steadily over the last years, all major markets registering a positive growth in demand and production in recent years with the exception of the Eurozone, due to the effects of the recent economic downturn."

[2] "Consequently, the recent boom in shale gas production has turned the United States into the lowest cost chemical producer outside the Middle East, as illustrated by the 126 investment projects totaling 84 billion dollars made up to September 2013 that have been tallied by the American Chemistry Council."

[3] "Indeed, the profitability of propane dehydrogenation is determined to a large extent by the price difference between propane and propylene, which makes the current market conditions very favorable."

[4] "As of this writing, ca. 5 million tons of propylene is produced annually by propane dehydrogenation (PDH). However, this number is expected to increase significantly in the upcoming years as dozens of new PDH installations have been announced worldwide, and many of these installations are already under construction."

[5] "The dehydrogenation activity of gallium oxide supported on ZSM-5, which was first reported in the late 1980s in studies dealing with conversion of propane to aromatics, has been the target of renewed attention in recent years."

[6] "The exact nature of the active sites in Ga-based dehydrogenation catalysts is still under debate."

[7] "β-Ga2O3 has a monoclinic structure, in which gallium atoms are equally distributed between tetrahedral and octahedral configurations. This crystal structure has a high concentration of weak Lewis acid sites (coordinatively unsaturated tetrahedral ones on the surface of the material), which are deemed to be centers of dehydrogenation activity."

[8] "Chen et al., who, by relating the results of NH3-TPD measurements with activity data for different GaxAl10xO15 mixed oxides, showed that a high concentration of Lewis acid groups in the form of coordinatively unsaturated tetrahedral Ga3+ cations is a prerequisite for dehydrogenation activity"

The growing demand for propylene has significantly influenced the development of new production methods, particularly propane dehydrogenation (PDH). Several factors have contributed to this trend:

1. Steady increase in demand for propylene across major markets.

2. The shale gas boom in the United States, which has made it a low-cost chemical producer.

3. Favorable market conditions due to the price difference between propane and propylene.

4. Significant growth in PDH production, with annual production around 5 million tons and expected to increase as new installations are announced and constructed worldwide.

Regarding Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts for PDH, understanding has evolved over time, but debates about active Ga species continue. Key points in the current knowledge include:

1. Renewed attention to gallium oxide supported on ZSM-5 for PDH in recent years.

2. Ongoing debate about the exact nature of active sites in Ga-based dehydrogenation catalysts.

3. Recognition of β-Ga2O3's monoclinic structure, with gallium atoms distributed between tetrahedral and octahedral configurations.

4. Identification of weak Lewis acid sites (coordinatively unsaturated tetrahedral surface sites) as potential centers of dehydrogenation activity.

5. Research findings linking a high concentration of Lewis acid groups, specifically coordinatively unsaturated tetrahedral Ga3+ cations, to dehydrogenation activity.

These developments have contributed to a deeper, though still evolving, understanding of Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts for PDH.

丙烯需求的增长显著影响了新生产方法的发展，特别是丙烷脱氢（PDH）。几个因素促成了这一趋势：

1. 主要市场对丙烯的需求稳步增长。

2. 美国页岩气繁荣，使其成为低成本化学品生产国。

3. 由于丙烷和丙烯之间的价格差异，市场条件有利。

4. PDH生产显著增长，年产量约500万吨，预计随着全球新装置的宣布和建设而增加。

关于Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂用于PDH，理解随时间演变，但对活性Ga物种的争论仍在继续。当前知识的关键点包括：

1. 近年来对负载在ZSM-5上的氧化镓用于PDH的renewed关注。

2. 关于Ga基脱氢催化剂中活性位点确切性质的持续争论。

3. 认识到β-Ga2O3的单斜结构，其中镓原子分布在四面体和八面体构型之间。

4. 识别弱Lewis酸位点（表面配位不饱和的四面体位点）为潜在的脱氢活性中心。

5. 研究发现将高浓度的Lewis酸基团，特别是配位不饱和的四面体Ga3+阳离子，与脱氢活性联系起来。

这些发展为Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂用于PDH提供了更深入但仍在不断发展的理解。
