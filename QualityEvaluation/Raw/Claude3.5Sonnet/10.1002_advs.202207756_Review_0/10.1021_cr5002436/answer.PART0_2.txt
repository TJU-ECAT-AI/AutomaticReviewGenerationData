[1] "Because of their extensive use as chemical building blocks, light olefins, such as propylene (propene) and ethylene (ethene), are among the most important types of compounds in the chemical industry."

[2] "The demand of these building blocks has increased steadily over the last years, all major markets registering a positive growth in demand and production in recent years with the exception of the Eurozone, due to the effects of the recent economic downturn."

[3] "Consequently, the recent boom in shale gas production has turned the United States into the lowest cost chemical producer outside the Middle East, as illustrated by the 126 investment projects totaling 84 billion dollars made up to September 2013 that have been tallied by the American Chemistry Council."

[4] "The high availability of these relatively cheap natural gas liquids, specifically ethane, has resulted in a shift from oil-based naphtha to shale-based ethane for steam cracking installations in the United States, with ethane crackers being constructed and naphtha crackers being either dismantled or converted. Relative to naphtha cracking, steam cracking of ethane produces a negligible amount of olefins other than ethylene, which is why the supply of propylene has dropped and its price has risen sharply, creating opportunities for on-purpose catalytic technologies, such as the catalytic dehydrogenation of light paraffins into the corresponding olefins."

[5] "Halasz et al. have tested the reactivity of propane on Ga- and In-loaded ZSM-5 and found both catalysts to be active in PDH and display similar activity and selectivity values."

[6] "The exact nature of the active sites in Ga-based dehydrogenation catalysts is still under debate."

[7] "Several authors have performed DFT calculations in an effort to understand the dehydrogenation reaction mechanism on Ga2O3."

[8] "Murata and co-workers have observed an increase in activity after a prereduction step with hydrogen at 550 C, while a simultaneous increase of Gaδ+H and GaOH sites was observed via NH3 TPD. These authors proposed that these sites also form during reaction and may be responsible for the dehydrogenation activity of the silica supported Ga2O3 catalyst."

The growing demand for propylene has significantly influenced the development of new production methods, particularly propane dehydrogenation (PDH). This shift has been driven by several factors:

1. Steady increase in demand for light olefins as chemical building blocks.

2. The shale gas boom in the United States, which has led to a shift from oil-based naphtha to shale-based ethane for steam cracking.

3. The resulting drop in propylene supply and sharp rise in its price, creating opportunities for on-purpose catalytic technologies like PDH.

The understanding of Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts for PDH has evolved over time, but there is still ongoing debate about the active Ga species. Key points in this evolution include:

1. Both Ga- and In-loaded ZSM-5 have been found to be active in PDH with similar activity and selectivity.

2. The exact nature of the active sites in Ga-based dehydrogenation catalysts remains under debate.

3. DFT calculations have been performed to understand the dehydrogenation reaction mechanism on Ga2O3.

4. Recent research has observed an increase in activity after a prereduction step with hydrogen, along with an increase in Gaδ+H and GaOH sites. These sites are proposed to form during the reaction and may be responsible for the dehydrogenation activity of silica-supported Ga2O3 catalysts.

Overall, while significant progress has been made in understanding Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts for PDH, there is still much to be learned about the specific active species and reaction mechanisms involved.

丙烯需求的增长极大地影响了新生产方法的发展，特别是丙烷脱氢（PDH）。这种转变由几个因素驱动：

1. 作为化学建筑块的轻烯烃需求稳步增长。

2. 美国页岩气繁荣，导致从基于石油的石脑油转向基于页岩的乙烷进行蒸汽裂解。

3. 由此导致的丙烯供应下降和价格急剧上涨，为定向催化技术（如PDH）创造了机会。

Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂在PDH中的理解随时间而演变，但对活性Ga物种的争论仍在继续。这一演变的关键点包括：

1. 发现Ga和In负载的ZSM-5在PDH中都具有活性，且活性和选择性相似。

2. Ga基脱氢催化剂中活性位点的确切性质仍有争议。

3. 已进行DFT计算以理解Ga2O3上的脱氢反应机理。

4. 最近的研究观察到，在氢气预还原步骤后，活性增加，同时Gaδ+H和GaOH位点增加。这些位点被认为在反应过程中形成，可能负责硅胶负载的Ga2O3催化剂的脱氢活性。

总的来说，虽然在理解Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂用于PDH方面取得了重大进展，但关于具体的活性物种和反应机理还有很多需要了解的地方。
