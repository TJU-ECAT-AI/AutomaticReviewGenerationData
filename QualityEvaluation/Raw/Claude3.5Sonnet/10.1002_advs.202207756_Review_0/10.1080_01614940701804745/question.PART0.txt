The selective transformation of light alkanes to aromatics that are more valuable and
versatile feedstocks for the chemical industry is one of the major challenges of catalytic
chemistry. The complexity of the aromatization chemistry makes it difficult to unravel
reaction mechanisms and, mechanistic information is largely developed from observed
product distributions. This article reviews the current mechanistic understanding for
the conversion of propane to aromatic compounds over HZSM-5 and Ga/HZSM-5 cata-
lysts based on experimental as well as theoretical studies.
Following a general discussion of acidity and confinement effects in these systems,
this review focuses on understanding specific reactions occurring on Brnsted acid sites
in HZSM-5. Mechanistic details available from Density Functional Theory (DFT) calcu-
lations, as well as kinetic modeling efforts for various complex hydrocarbon systems are
critically reviewed. A detailed, tabulated review of the literature compares the catalytic
performance of gallium modified ZSM-5 catalysts and subsequently the promotional
effect of gallium as an additive is critically discussed in terms of the nature of the
active sites, as well as the new reaction pathways introduced by gallium addition.

on production of benzene, toluene, and xylene (BTX) from propane, a process
that has inspired widespread interest from the industrial community (1).
Industrial processes developed for this application include:
i.
the M-2 forming process developed by Mobil with HZSM-5 as a catalyst
using a variety of feedstocks such as pyrolysis gasoline, unsaturated
gases from catalytic cracking of paraffinic napthas, and LPG (2);
ii.
the Cyclar process developed by BP and UOP for converting LPG into
aromatic products using a gallium-doped zeolite based catalyst formu-
lation and a continuous catalyst regeneration scheme; and
iii.
the Aroforming process developed by IFP and SALUTEC using a shape
selective zeolite doped with metal oxides designed to aromatize a large
range of aliphatic hydrocarbons, either LPGs or light napthas. This
process is based on multiple fixed bed isothermal tubular reactors, some
of which are run in reaction mode, while the others are under
regeneration.
The drawback of these processes is the production of large amounts of fuel
gas by cracking. In general, zeolites with MFI pore structure are used due to
their high resistance to deactivation with metal components added to
enhance the dehydrogenation function; gallium has emerged as the most prom-
ising metal additive for this reaction system.
The literature of zeolite-based solid acid catalysts is extensive due to their
use in more than 110 commercial processes employed in the petrochemical
industry (3). We present a brief discussion of topics concerning acidity, adsorp-
tion phenomena, confinement effects, and the nature of surface species formed
on the catalyst surface as a background for the discussion on light alkane aro-
matization on ZSM-5 based formulations. This paper focuses on reviewing the
literature concerning aromatization of light alkanes on HZSM-5 and gallium-
modified ZSM-5 catalysts.

BACKGROUND
Our brief discussion focuses on high silica zeolites with an emphasis on ZSM-5
catalysts and only considers Brnsted acid sites. The reader is referred to excel-
lent reviews on organic reactions over zeolites (3), acid function in zeolites (4),
inorganic solid acids (5), methods for characterizing zeolite acidity (6), theoreti-
cal quantum chemical studies of hydrocarbon reactions over zeolite catalysts,
(7) and more recent challenges for zeolite chemistry (8) for a much broader dis-
cussion on zeolitic materials.

2.1.
Influence of Structural Effects and Chemical
Composition on Acidity
Zeolite structures containing only SiO2 tetrahedra would be electrically
neutral and hence, contain no acidity. Brnsted acid sites are generated
when Si4 is isomorphically substituted by a trivalent cation, for example by
Al3 in zeolites. The negative charge that is created in the lattice is compen-
sated by a proton attached to one of the lattice oxygen atoms bridging to the
aluminum atom. The resulting hydroxyl group is responsible for Brnsted
acidity of zeolites.
ZSM-5 is classified as a medium-pore zeolite with inter-connected 10-
membered straight and sinusoidal pores that result in a three-dimensional
pore network. The straight channel has dimensions of 5.3 A
 X 5.6 A
 , while
the sinusoidal channel has dimensions of 5.1 A
 X 5.6 A
 . The unit cell of ZSM-
5 consists of 96 T sites (tetrahedrally coordinated framework Al or Si) 12 of
which are crystallographically inequivalent. The unit cell formula for HZSM-
5 is Hn[AlnSi96-nO192]16H2O with n , 27. The orthorhombic structure of
the zeolite (space group Pnma) has unit cell dimensions of a  20.1 A
 ,
b  19.9 A
 , and c  13.4 A
 . Our discussion of structural effects on zeolite
acidity first details theoretical investigations that address this issue followed
by experimental investigations on high-silica materials.
Several groups have used computational methods to determine the influ-
ence of structural effects such as Al-O (T-O) distances and bond angles in the
Al-OH-Si (T-O-T) group on the acidity of the hydroxyl group. Acidity differ-
ences in these studies are generally characterized in terms of deprotonation
energy (DPE) or the proton affinity (PA). Chatterjee et al. (9) investigated
the effect of isomorphous substitution of various trivalent cations (B, Ga, Al,
and Fe) using a 5 T cluster terminated with OH bonds. Aluminum substitution
was calculated to result in the highest acid strength and the polarizability
order of the cations Al . Ga . Fe.B was observed to match up with the cal-
culated deprotonation energies. Similar conclusions were also stated by
Strodel et al. (10).
OMalley and Dwyer (11) varied the T-O-T angle for a 2T cluster and using
Hartree-Fock (HF/3-21G) ab initio methods concluded that increasing the T-O-
T angle led to a decrease in the O-H bond stretching frequency and a corre-
sponding decrease in the ionicity of the OH bond, and, hence its acidity.
Alvarado-Swaisgood et al. (12) postulate that since Al-O bond lengths are
longer than the corresponding Si-O bond lengths, the Al is likely to be sited
at those T-sites where the T-O bond length is longest. Based on calculations
(HF/double-z basis sets) done for Al substitution (in absence of a counterion)
into a T(OH)4 monomeric cluster for each of the 12 crystallographic T-sites in
MFI, the T6, T12, and T9 sites were found to be the most favorable sites
while the T3 site was found to be the least favorable. The least favorable and

most favorable sites only differed by 13.8 kJ/mol in replacement energy
suggesting an almost statistical distribution of aluminum in HZSM-5. On
similar lines, Bell and coworkers (13) also calculated several tetrahedral
sites to be energetically comparable with regard to Al siting. These researchers
also emphasize the effects of structural relaxation upon Al substitution.
Modeling Al siting in HZSM-5 by defect energy minimization and describing
two-body interactions by the Buckingham exp-6 potential function, and the
O-Si-O and O-Al-O angle bending by a harmonic dependence, Schro
der et al.
(14) calculate small energy differences between the various lattice sites
suggesting little deviation from a random distribution of Al over the MFI fra-
mework sites. Grau-Crespo et al. (15) have employed a strategy similar to
the one outlined by Schro
der, and based on Al substitution in each of the 24
non-equivalent crystallographic sites in ZSM-5 (the monoclinic structure of
ZSM-5 at higher temperatures has lower symmetry than the orthorhombic
structure and hence has 24 T sites) in absence of counterions have found
a range of 66.9 kJ/mol for the 24 T sites. Deprotonation energies are
typically 1100 kJ/mol, implying that deprotonation reactions are typically
concerted; hence, the lack of counterions in this study may influence the
energy range for Al substitution calculated by these authors. The protonation
of the structure was also studied by these authors and was modeled as two
random events: the first being the siting of the Al and the second being the
binding of the proton to one of the four non-equivalent oxygen atoms around
the Al atom. In agreement with Redondo and Hay. (16), they conclude that
acid sites with protons located in the large pores of the zeolite are favored.
Redondo and Hay (16) included counterion and relaxation effects within a
semi-empirical MNDO approach and concluded that a direct relationship
between the experimental T-O-T angle and the proton affinity existed with
higher proton affinity corresponding to smaller T-O-T angles. Chatterjee
et al. (17) have attempted to derive electronic properties such as density of
states, energy of the frontier molecular orbitals and contributions from differ-
ent atomic orbitals in ZSM-5 using monomer [T(OH)4], dimer [(OH)3-T-O-T-
(OH)3] and pentamer [T-O4 (T(OH)3)4] cluster models. They also conclude
that longer T-O and smaller T-O-T bond angles are preferred for aluminum sub-
stitution. In addition, the T-O-T-O dihedral angle was also proposed to play a
significant role in the energetics as it was postulated to determine the orien-
tation of adjacent TO4 groups relative to the central TO4 group. Kramer and
van Santen (18) have commented on the similar lattice stability of 4-, 5-, and
6-membered rings and the very shallow Si-O-Si potential energy surface that
results in easy deformation of the lattice and is a key to lattice stability.
Using force field calculations, they correlate the proton affinity with the
length of the T-O bond involved with the acidic hydroxyl upon substitution of
lattice Si by Al. The larger the T-T distance between the T atoms concerned,
the stronger the hydroxyl bond; implying that the mismatch between the

effective size of the [Si-O(H)-Al] system and the original [Si-O-Si] volume is the
main parameter controlling the deprotonation energy.
Cook et al. (19) compared results from isolated clusters and clusters
embedded in a Madelung field generated by the zeolite framework to
examine the effects of cluster termination. A 5T cluster terminated with
hydrogen atoms positioned along the Si-O crystallographic directions at a
distance of 1 A
 was used with the Ewald summation considered to be due to
a completely siliceous framework. No significant structural differences were
found upon inclusion of the Madelung field, however, significant differences
in the electronic structure were noted. The proton was significantly depleted
of charge (0.33e compared to 0.5e) upon inclusion of the Madelung field and
this was attributed as an artifact of the calculation method. The acidic
moiety was characterized as a soft acid characterized by a diffuse electron
density distribution by employing the absolute electronegativity x and
absolute hardness (20, 21) as defined by Parr and coworkers. Brand and co-
workers (22, 23) have also shown significant variation in the proton affinity
and OH stretching frequency as a function of cluster size, cluster shape, and
cluster termination. In agreement with other studies discussed above, the
proton affinity was calculated to be in the range 12001300 kJ/mol with the
best estimate for the O(24) site being 1234 kJ/mol using the HF/6-31G level
of theory.
In a series of ab initio studies, Eichler et al. (24), Brandle and Sauer (25),
and Sauer and Sierka (26), have used combined quantum mechanics and
interatomic potential function (QM/Pot) methods aimed at addressing short-
comings of the cluster model. Long range interactions were included at the
level of the interatomic potential function with the parameters for the potential
function being derived from ab initio calculations. The deprotonation energy of
HZSM-5 was calculated to be 1171 kJ/mol and was observed to be stable within
a few kJ/mol with increasing cluster size. In contrast to cluster based studies
mentioned above, no correlation was found between T-O-T bond angles or 1H
NMR chemical shifts and heats of deprotonation. Calculated energies of NH3
adsorption (formation of NH4
) did not indicate the same acidity sequence as
the energies of deprotonation when comparing different zeolite framework
structures (FAU, CHA, MOR, and MFI). The different order was attributed
to specific interaction of the NH4
 with the negatively charged oxygen atoms
of the zeolite framework.
The relationship between the T-O-T angle and the proton affinity can be
analyzed with simple chemical arguments as follows. Assuming the Brnsted
acid proton lies in the plane of the Si-O-Al bond, the three pairs of electrons
involved in the O-H, Al-O, and Si-O bonds are expected to form 1208 angles.
Thus, the protonated oxygen atom has a tendency to have an equilibrium
bond angle of 1208 subject to lattice constraints. In an X-ray diffraction exper-
iment typically the Si-O-Si bond angle is observed given the high silicon to

aluminum ratio in the materials. A large amount of strain is expected to be
introduced into the zeolite lattice upon protonation and the proton affinity is
expected to be smaller when the initial T-O-T angle, before the introduction
of the aluminum and the compensating proton, is large. This argument
however, is contradicted by the QM/Pot studies by Sauer and coworkers for
the MFI framework. In addition, some assumptions of the model such as a
planar Al-O(H)-Si configuration are known to be incorrect.
Another aspect of these computational studies rarely discussed in the lit-
erature is the high deprotonation energy value of approximately 1250 kJ/
mol evaluated. DFT studies (19, 27) have shown that the O-H bond for the
Brnsted acid site has significant covalent character with the charge on the
hydrogen atom being approximately 0.5 e. The proton transfer process is typi-
cally accompanied by simultaneous bond formation on one of the four lattice
oxygen atoms linked to the aluminum atom. Hence, the calculation of proton
affinity values and hence acid strength on the basis of deprotonation of
zeolite cluster models which involves significant charge transfer and includes
lattice relaxation upon removal of the proton may not be representative of
proton transfer acid catalyzed reactions.
Several experimental studies have also addressed zeolite acidity; our dis-
cussion focuses on HZSM-5. Early work in alkane cracking over low-silica fau-
jasites, like H-Y concluded that catalytic activity increased as aluminum was
removed from the lattice. Based on the following discussion, it will become
apparent, however, that this relationship is not valid for high silica materials
like HZSM-5.
Olson et al. (28), Haag et al. (29), Haag et al. (30), and Olson et al. (31)
investigated the chemical and physical properties of ZSM-5 materials with
alumina content varied over several orders of magnitude. Physical properties
such as the X-ray diffraction pattern, pore size and volume, framework
density and refractive index were found to be independent of the SiO2:Al2O3
ratio while the cesium exchange capacity, the catalytic activity probed by the
cracking of n-hexane and the water adsorption capacity were found to be a
linear function of Al content even over a 400-fold change in Al content.
Barthomeuf (32) studied the dependence of zeolite acidity on structure and
chemical environment by incorporating the information about the specific
lattice in the topological density (TD2-5). Taking into consideration the non-
equivalent T sites, a weighted mean number of tetrahedra was defined and
divided by the maximum number of tetrahedra in a four-connected net of T
atoms by considering all the tetrahedra included between the second and
fifth layer around a T site. The aluminum topological density, defined as the
product of the TD25 and the aluminum molar fraction, was used to evaluate
the density of AlO4
2 in the ensemble of tetrahedra comprising the second to
fifth layer surrounding a T site. It was noted that for Si/Al 9.5 for HZSM-5
the acidity is constant based on a TDAl  2.65  1022. At this point all the

acid sites are supposed to be far enough apart that they do not interact with
each other to decrease their efficiency and their acid strength. Since TDAl inte-
grates chemical and topological effects, this limit is considered to be applicable
for any zeolite structure. In a combined experimental and theoretical study to
interpret NH3-TPD results in microporous zeolitic materials in light of confine-
ment effects (see Section 3.3), Hunger et al. (33) find a heterogeneity of
only 7 kJ/mol for all the OH groups in the MFI and FER frameworks. In
agreement with Barthomeuf (32) the above study also states that down to
TDAl  2.65  1022, the mean acid strength increases linearly and is nearly
constant for higher values of TDAl.
Sharma and coworkers (34) have characterized the acidity of HZSM-5
using microcalorimetry and temperature-programmed desorption (TPD). The
plot of differential enthalpy change upon ammonia adsorption versus
coverage was dominated by a large plateau of nearly constant differential
enthalpy change (DHads  2150 kJ/mol), indicative of similar acid strength
across all sites. Calorimetric studies, however, do not probe the nature of the
binding sites specifically and differential heats measured, in general, incorpor-
ate local structural effects of the binding site, as well as any confinement
characteristics that may arise due to the nature and size of the base
molecule employed (see Section 2.3).
TPD of ammonia and pyridine is probably the most widely used method for
characterizing acidity in zeolites. Several dimensionless groups have been
described by Gorte (35) and Gorte and Demmin (36) to assess re-adsorption
and transport effects in desorption from catalyst beds and these must be
accounted for when considering TPD as a characterization technique. In
their study, Sharma and coworkers (34) found ammonia TPD not to be
limited by re-adsorption, while pyridine desorption from HZSM-5 was found
to be limited by molecular diffusion in the zeolite crystallites and hence, the
authors suggest that pyridine is a poor choice as a probe molecule for assess-
ment of acid strength by TPD. This NH3-TPD study also provides evidence
for a relatively homogeneous acid-strength distribution in ZSM-5.
Investigators [6, 3742] have used the 13C chemical shift of acetone as well
as reactive elimination of isopropylamine as probes for Brnsted acidity in
zeolites. For a stoichiometry less than 1:1, the 13C chemical shift exhibited
an anisotropy similar to that of solid acetone indicating localization within
the zeolite pores due to the presence of the Brnsted acid site, while at
coverages even slightly greater than one the entire line shape collapsed to
a
single
narrow
line
indicating
rapid
exchange
between
physisorbed
acetone and the localized acetone at the Brnsted acid sites. To a first app-
roximation, the measured chemical shifts were taken to be indicative of an
intrinsic acidity while the anisotropic lineshapes modulated by the localized
molecular reorientations at the Brnsted acid site provided insight into the
reorientation barriers within molecular sieves. The narrow linewidth of the

Downloaded by [Harvard College] at 06:34 18 August 2013 
proton-decoupled 13C MAS NMR spectra at low temperatures indicated that
the acid sites must be relatively homogeneous in HZSM-5. Reactive elimination
studies (for example the unimolecular decomposition of adsorbed isopropyla-
mine to form propene and ammonia) also showed stoichiometric behavior
with the number of Al sites and any adsorbate in excess of this ratio was
found to desorb at much lower temperatures.
Although the above experimental studies strongly suggest dilute, isolated
sites that have the same acidity, IR investigations of weakly adsorbed mol-
ecules in HZSM-5 have suggested heterogeneity of OH groups in the H-MFI
framework (43, 44). In summary, unlike theoretical methods discussed
earlier in this section, experimental methods provide sample averaged
measures of acidity. Although most of the experimental studies suggest
uniform sites in HZSM-5, these results would also be consistent with a distri-
bution of sites of different activity provided the distribution is largely
unchanged for all aluminum concentrations in the sample.
2.2.
Adsorption Phenomena
As discussed by Corma (5), a reactant molecule that diffuses into the zeolite
channel is subject to a series of interactions. For high silica materials mainly
dispersive forces are present and these hydrophobic materials preferentially
adsorb non-polar organic compounds. In general, a number of unique phenom-
ena such as inverse shape selectivity (45) pertaining to the preferential adsorp-
tion of bulkier versus less bulky molecules within microporous solids, pore
mouth and key-lock selectivity (46) pertaining to interaction of normal and
branched alkanes with unidimensional medium pore zeolites, window effect
and commensurate freezing of alkanes (47, 48) pertaining to variations in the
diffusivity and type of sorption isotherm of n-alkanes with increasing carbon
number and the nest effect (49) wherein a molecule and its direct environment
tend reciprocally to optimize their van der Waals interaction are indicative of
preferential adsorption behavior. Our discussion focuses on developing the
crucial role of adsorption behavior in these systems with a particular
emphasis on alkane adsorption and MFI based materials.
For high silica materials, Stach et al. (50) report that the heat of adsorption
of n-paraffins in mesoporous materials is similar to the heat of condensation,
while for microporous materials, when the pore dimensions become compar-
able to the critical diameter of the molecules adsorbed, the zero coverage
heat of adsorption increases exponentially with decreasing mean pore
diameter. Stach and coworkers (51) and Janchen et al, (52) have also studied
the correlation between the initial heats of adsorption and structural par-
ameters as well as chemical composition of the microporous material using
calorimetry. The heats of adsorption of n-paraffins increased linearly with
aluminum content of the molecular sieve, and a linear relationship between

the adsorption enthalpy and the average effective electronegativity, calculated
based on the tendency of an atom to attract electrons (in a molecule), and the
electronegativity equalization formalism (53), was also observed. For non-
polar molecules the initial adsorption heat was found to increase with increas-
ing density of T-atoms which also corresponds to decreasing effective
electronegativity.
Savitz et al. (54) measured isosteric heats and adsorption isotherms of
three alkanes (methane, ethane, propane) on a series of six high-silica
zeolites (TON, MTW, UTD-1, MFI, FER, FAU). Amongst the one-dimensional
zeolite structures TON, MTW, and UTD-1, a decrease in the heat of adsorption
with increasing pore size was observed for all alkanes. For all systems investi-
gated, the van der Waals interactions were evaluated to dominate the electro-
static
interactions
for
non-polar
paraffinic
molecules.
Specifically,
an
incremental heat of adsorption of 10 kJ/mol per carbon number was
observed for MFI. A Lennard-Jones 12-6 potential for the adsorbate molecule
interacting with a single layer of oxygen atoms representing the pore walls
of the lattice was found to give adsorption enthalpy values in good agreement
with experiment.
Investigators (55, 56) have obtained Henrys Law constants for alkanes
under high temperature and low pressure conditions over various different
zeolite structures. On all zeolites the Henry constants were observed to
increase exponentially with the alkane chain length. Smaller pore dimensions
resulted in an increase in the adsorption enthalpy accompanied by a high loss
in entropy of the molecule upon adsorption. A linear increase in DH0 and DS0
with carbon number and hence, a compensation effect, was observed. On
HMFI, the Henry constants of isoalkanes were systematically lower than
those for n-alkanes of the same carbon number, the difference becoming
larger with increasing degree of branching, highlighting the steric effects for
van der Waals interactions between the zeolite and the alkane molecule.
Eder and Lercher (57) have done a comparative study on alkane sorption
on siliceous and aluminophosphate molecular sieves by means of gravimetry
and calorimetry measurements. The identical sorption enthalpies of isostruc-
tural AlPO-5 and SSZ-24 indicates that chemical composition for neutral
samples has a negligible impact on the energetics of alkane sorption. With
decreasing pore diameter and increasing framework density the sorption
enthalpy was found to increase. An additional role of the pore shape was also
observed, however. High sorption enthalpies of n-alkanes on AlPO-11 indicated
an excellent fit between the alkanes and the elliptical pores of the zeolite. This
explanation is in line with the nest effect as proposed by Derouane (49).
Derouane and coworkers (5860) have derived a van der Waals model for
molecule-curved surface interactions in microporous solids (see Section 2.3.)
that considers the zeolite as an isotropic dielectric medium interacting with a
point isotropic molecule in a spherical cavity. The van der Waals energy

derived based on the dynamic polarizability of the reactant molecule and the
extrinsic surface curvature was observed to increase monotonically with
decreasing pore size and eventually reach a value eight times that of the equiv-
alent flat surface. An optimum value of 2/3 for the ratio of the sorption distance
from the ideal point molecule to the pore wall and the effective spherical pore
radius was calculated. These studies suggest that sorbed molecules will have a
strong tendency to stick to the pore wall, and that the interaction between the
physisorbed molecule and the zeolite will be stabilized as the fit between the
adsorbate and the pore geometry improves.
Bates et al. (61) have investigated the pore size dependence of n-alkane
(C4-C10) adsorption in all silica zeolites (MFI, MOR, FAU, RHO, LTA, and
FER) using configurational-bias Monte Carlo (CBMC) simulations. The CH3
and CH2 groups of the alkanes were treated as single interaction centers and
the interaction between the oxygen atoms of the zeolite lattice and the CHn
groups was modeled by a 12-6 Lennard-Jones potential. For all zeolites
studied, the heat of adsorption was found to increase linearly with alkane
chain length. The heat of adsorption increased as the pore diameter decreased
from 7.4 A
 to 5 A
 , while for smaller pores the heat of adsorption was predicted
to decrease because alkanes in smaller-pore materials preferentially adsorbed
in a localized, highly coiled state in the largest void volume of the structure,
and hence, sample a larger pore diameter than that generally used to charac-
terize the material.
In a series of publications, researchers (6266) have addressed the sorption
of alkanes on various acidic zeolites as studied by gravimetry, calorimetry, and
infrared spectroscopy; we focus on their work regarding HZSM-5. The intensity
of the 3610 cm21 band attributed to Brnsted acid sites (in the infrared
spectrum) was observed to decrease upon increasing alkane partial pressure
(most studies were done in the pressure range of 1023 to 3 mbar) and to com-
pletely disappear at higher alkane partial pressures indicating that all
Brnsted acid sites interacted with physisorbed alkanes. The interaction
between the apolar alkane and the zeolite hydroxyl group was postulated to
occur via dipole-induced hydrogen bonding and was noted to contribute  10
kJ/mol to the differential heat of adsorption, independent of the carbon
number of the alkane. A significant difference between n- and iso-paraffins
was the 12 kJ/mol lower value for the heat of sorption observed for the corre-
sponding iso-paraffins indicating that the heat of adsorption depends subtly on
the fit between the size of the alkane molecule and the size of the zeolite pores.
A compensation effect between the enthalpy and the entropy of sorption was
found for n-alkanes resulting in the higher heat of adsorption due to the
direct alkane-acid site interaction being partly compensated by higher loss in
entropy of the molecule upon adsorption. The specific contribution due to
acid sites attributed to induced polarization in alkanes was found to be 6 kJ/
mol for FAU compared to 10 kJ/mol for MFI. The lower value for FAU was

attributed to localized interaction of the physisorbed alkane molecule in FAU
such that the alkane molecule is unable to alter its configuration to
maximize van der Waals interactions with the remaining zeolite structure.
An increase in adsorption enthalpy of 10.1 kJ/mol per added -CH2group
was also observed by Arik et al. (67) based on their pulse chromatographic
studies on ZSM-5 with Si/Al ratios ranging from 12 to 400. Ab initio and
DFT based calculations have also confirmed the magnitude of the specific inter-
action induced by the Brnsted acid site (27, 68).
Recent work from Truitt et al. (69) has also evidenced the formation of a
specific adsorption complex between an alkane and Brnsted acid sites in
zeolites based on (i) loading dependent chemical shift for 1H NMR upon inter-
action of isobutane with Brnsted acid sites in HZSM-5, and (ii) 1H ! 13C CP/
MAS NMR studies following adsorption of isobutane-d10 that only showed a
signal for 13C isobutane upon 1H excitation in the cross polarization sequence.
Configurational-bias Monte Carlo (CBMC) simulations suggest a particu-
lar phase transition for C6 and C7 alkanes in silicalite due to the interplay
between the length of the sinusoidal channels and the length of the alkane
(47, 48, 61). Because of the size match between hexane and the dimensions
of the sinusoidal channel in silicalite, these channels are packed, with little
freedom of movement for the hexane molecules, before the straight channels
are packed at high loadings. The molecules in the zigzag channels are hence
considered frozen and this behavior results in a plateau in the adsorption
isotherm that is only observed for C6 and C7. Experimental studies by Olson
and Reischman (70) have confirmed two distinct adsorption regimes for
hexane in ZSM-5, with the break occurring at a loading of 3.7 hexane mol-
ecules/unit cell, close to 4, which corresponds to the number of sinusoidal
channel double ten rings per MFI unit cell.
In summary, physisorption energies in microporous materials become com-
parable to the activation energies for chemical reactions. The adsorbates recog-
nize sites which are most favorable and tend to interact preferentially with the
zeolite walls in the absence of induced polarization interactions due to the
Brnsted acid site. In general, the sorption energies arise primarily due to
van der Waals type interactions and increase with decreasing pore dimensions
of the zeolite and carbon number of the adsorbate. This increase is
accompanied by a compensation effect, however, and a corresponding
increase in adsorption entropy. Additional effects of confinement within micro-
porous materials are briefly discussed in the next section.
2.3.
Confinement Effects
Derouane and coworkers (5860, 7174) have highlighted the importance
of guest-host relationships for molecules adsorbed in microporous materials
and their importance in understanding catalytic behavior. They consider

zeolites as solid solvents and attribute the high concentration of reactants and
hence facile bimolecular reactions in the micropores of the zeolite to high heats
of physisorption resulting due to confinement effects. They also attribute
enhanced diffusion of alkanes, and different acid strengths as measured by
adsorption of ammonia and amines, to the strong intermolecular forces
between the adsorbates and the zeolite framework arising due to confinement.
As described previously, they develop a model based on a critical variable, the
dimensionless ratio of the molecule size to the cage/channel size, s  d/a (d 
distance of the point molecule to the pore wall, a  pore radius), which is suffi-
cient to quantify the magnification of dispersion forces relative to a flat surface
of similar chemical nature. Based on this model they derive the optimal tight fit
criteria for molecules to correspond to s  d/a  1.136. This optimal s value
corresponds to a pore size equal to 88% of the free gaseous molecular size
implying that molecules can contract to enter pores. Considering the pore
walls of the zeolite to be a dense arrangement of oxygen anions that polarize
the electron density of the adsorbed molecule, they postulate that the screening
of electrons of NMR sensitive nuclei will vary and hence, the position of their
NMR resonance will be a function of the pore size. This solvation behavior of
zeolites has been evidenced by 129Xe NMR experiments for various zeolite fra-
meworks (74). Barthomeuf (32) had originally proposed a solvation effect of
zeolite micropores however, no specific consideration was given to the role of
dispersive forces between the adsorbate and the adsorbent.
Researchers (6, 38, 75, 76) have also investigated confinement effects and
acidity in zeolites by using NMR methods. Local interactions dominate the reor-
ientation and dynamics associated with motion of the adsorbate with the zeolite
micropores. Motional averaging leads to narrowing of the line shapes associated
with dipolar splitting while leaving the spin +1/2 transitions unaffected in
NMR studies. For coverages below one per site, wherein stoichiometric
complexes result, the barrier to reorientation decreases with increasing pore
dimensions as evidenced by 13C NMR studies for CH3
13COCH3 and 1H NMR
studies for CH3CN.
Farneth and Gorte (6) and Lee et al. (77) have addressed the thermochem-
istry of amine/HZSM-5 complexes. The interaction between the amine and the
solid acid was considered to be a function of the deprotonation energy of the
acid site and the gas phase proton affinity of the basic molecule. This has
been disputed by Derouane and Chang (73) who advocate consideration of con-
finement and solvation effects for a detailed understanding of the interaction of
bases with acid sites in zeolites. They argue against gas phase proton affinity
values being adequate descriptors of adsorption processes in zeolites since
the molecule inside the zeolite cavity is strongly solvated and confinement
effects may represent up to 40% of the adsorption heat of bases in zeolites.
They instead state that the interaction should be considered as a sum of two
contributions; one arising purely due to confinement effects and one due to

acid-base interaction. In agreement with Derouane and Chang (73), Hunger
et al. (33) have successfully modeled NH3-TPD in various zeolites by consider-
ing physisorption confinement interactions and acid-base protonation as
discrete contributions. In contrast, Yang et al. (76) categorized confinement
effects in high silica zeolites under two classes: (i) reactant molecules interact-
ing primarily with the siliceous walls of the zeolites, so that confinement is
unconstrained by the location of acid sites, for example n-C6H14 adsorption
in MFI is similar whether or not acid sites are present. In this case the
authors consider calorimetric measurements with CH4 or O2 to probe the
zeolite cavities, since these two molecules do not interact significantly with
residual hydroxyls or alkali metal cations; and (ii) when adsorption is localized
at the Brnsted acid sites and the orientation of the adsorption complex is con-
strained by the hydrogen bond to the zeolites. In this case, studies of physically
adsorbed species cannot adequately describe the environment of the reactant
molecules as the localization of the adsorbate by the acid site affects the orien-
tation and molecular motion of the adsorbed molecule. For adsorption of strong
bases like NH3 they argue that localization affects the ability of the adsorbate
to optimize its interactions with the cavity walls and hence, the interaction
cannot be considered as the discrete sum of dispersive confinement interactions
and acid-base protonation energies.
Besides the effects of spatial confinement, investigators (7880) have
addressed the electronic confinement of molecules in zeolite micropores,
wherein confinement strongly perturbs the energy levels of the reactant,
hence enhancing its reactivity. The implications of electronic confinement
require that due to the covalent character of aluminosilicate crystals and
high degree of delocalization of electrons, the density of orbitals of the guest
molecule has to drop to nearly zero in proximity of the zeolite walls because
of short-range repulsion. A one-dimensional confined model for ethylene
absorbed into a zeolite cavity was simulated by two parallel planes using the
Hu
ckel Molecular Orbital (HMO) theory. Based on these assumptions, a nar-
rowing of the energy gap between p and p orbitals of ethylene was
observed. In general, an increase of the energy levels was observed. The p
orbital was observed to be perturbed more, however, and this was explained
in terms of the presence of a nodal plane in the p orbital. The larger pertur-
bation of the p orbital implies lesser electron density in the bonding orbital
and hence weakening of the carbon-carbon bond which can also be interpreted
in terms of an enhanced basicity of the ethylene molecule. The smaller bonding-
antibonding (HOMO-LUMO) energy gap implies that the molecule is softer in
the confined environment. These perturbations of the frontier orbitals may
imply a pre-activation of the molecule upon confinement.
In a separate study, ab initio (HF/3-21G) calculations were used to inves-
tigate the modification of the frontier orbitals in toluene in all silica clusters
(80 atoms) of zeolites Beta, ZSM-12 and ZSM-5, and, in ZSM-5 with
Propane Aromatization over HZSM-5 and Ga/HZSM-5 Catalysts

varying aluminum content to investigate the effect of pore size and chemical
composition, respectively (79). The influence of confinement in different all
silica micropores was determined by establishing the distortion of the HOMO
when placing the toluene molecule in the geometrical center of the clusters.
The general trend observed was an increase in the HOMO of toluene with
decreasing cavity size. Due to introduction of aluminum and hence the
Brnsted acid proton in the ZSM-5 cluster, the negative potential created
inside the zeolite pores by lattice oxygen atoms projecting inside the zeolite
cavities is shielded. This resulted in a decrease in the HOMO energy of
toluene with increasing aluminum content. These results show that gas
phase predictions of orbital energy and reactivity may be significantly
altered in the confined environment of microporous materials.
In summary, confinement effects significantly change the heats of sorption
and concentration of reactants within the zeolite micropores, as well as the
character of the frontier orbitals of the sorbate within microporous materials.
Due to their nature and magnitude, they significantly affect the catalytic
activity of microporous solid acids.
2.4.
Nature of Surface Intermediates
Initially the catalytic behavior of zeolites was compared to that of supera-
cids, and hence, carbocationic surface intermediates were postulated. As
initially discussed by Kazansky and coworkers (81, 82), the transformations
of hydrocarbons on zeolites are similar to solution phase chemistry, the promi-
nent difference being the replacement of solvation by water by the interaction
of adsorbed carbocations with basic surface oxygen atoms of the zeolite lattice.
The principal difference between homogeneous systems and the heterogeneous
solid acid systems arises due to the much larger stabilization of intermediate
carbocations by solvation in homogenous systems.
Kazansky and coworkers showed that protonation of adsorbed ethylene
resulted in the formation of covalent surface alkoxides instead of carbenium
ions. The bifunctional character of the active site was demonstrated to result
in a concerted transfer of the Brnsted acid proton and the simultaneous inter-
action of the adsorbate with a neighboring negatively charged oxygen atom.
Owing to the absence of strong solvation effects, the surface intermediates
were shown to be simply not as ionic as initially postulated, instead carbe-
nium-ion like transition states were proposed. Even though the initial calcu-
lations from Kazansky and coworkers were done on small zeolite clusters
involving two or three tetrahedral (2T or 3T) sites using the semi-empirical
modified neglect of differential overlap (MNDO) method, these conclusions
have been reinforced by several computational studies (27, 8386) and have
significantly advanced the original concept of carbocationic intermediates in
zeolites.

The existence of polarized alkoxy intermediates was postulated by
McVicker et al. (87) and Kramer et al. (88) for butene and 2-methylpent-1-
ene isomerization, however, no experimental evidence was presented in favor
of this argument. Aronson et al. (89) used 13C NMR spectroscopy to character-
ize intermediates formed by the adsorption of 2-methyl-2-propanol on HZSM-5,
and provided experimental proof for the formation of surface alkoxides upon
interaction of an olefin with H sites in zeolites. The 13C NMR spectrum
obtained after adsorption and evacuation was observed to show two prominent
features, one at 77 ppm from reference trimethylsilane (TMS), which was
assigned to carbon bonded to the zeolite lattice oxygen atoms, and a second
at 29 ppm, which was attributed to aliphatic carbon species formed due to oli-
gomerization reactions. No spectral features corresponding to carbenium ions
were observed, although the chemistry observed for the adsorbed intermediate
was consistent with the formation of carbenium ions. The proposed chemical
reaction profile for alcohol dehydration on the basis of NMR, TPD-TGA, and
IR experiments involves the formation of an oxonium ion that dehydrates to
form an alkoxide intermediate with the transition from the oxonium ion to
the silyl ether intermediate postulated to occur via a carbenium ion transition
state. In a parallel study Haw and coworkers (90) studied the oligomerization of
propene-2-13C on zeolite HY employing in situ variable temperature 13C solid-
state NMR with cross polarization (CP) and magic-angle spinning (MAS). 13C
CP/MAS spectra at 273 K showed a peak at 87 ppm which was attributed to
alkoxy species and did not show a peak at 250 ppm that would have evidenced
carbenium ion species.
Datemaetal.(91) analyzed the oligomerization ofethylene overHZSM-5,H-Y
and H-MOR by 13C MAS NMR experiments. Consistent with the observations of
Gorte and coworkers, the resonance positions in the 13C NMR spectra for this
work were consistent with the existence of alkoxide intermediates. A comparison
across structurally different zeolites revealed that the degree of branching of the
final products increased with increasing pore dimensions. Hence, HZSM-5
primarily produces linear products. A recent IR and 13C NMR study of ethylene
oligomerization on HZSM-5 from Stepanov et al. (92) has also confirmed that
linear alkoxy species represent the main adsorption state of oligomers in equili-
brium with a vanishingly small concentration of oligomeric carbenium ions.
In summary, although recent experimental (93, 94) studies have shown the
existence of persistent carbenium ions in zeolites for molecules with high
proton affinities and carbenium ions have also been proposed in recent theoreti-
cal studies (95) based on steric inaccessibility arguments, in general, strong
coulombic interactions between the adsorbed intermediate and the catalyst
surface substantially modify the geometry and reactivity of the adsorbed
species and require that the stable intermediates in the heterogeneous acid-
catalyzed transformations of hydrocarbons on zeolites are covalently bonded
alkoxide intermediates.

ALKANE AROMATIZATION ON HZSM-5 CATALYSTS
Reactions of alkanes, including cracking, dehydrogenation, isomerization,
hydrogen transfer, and disproportionation, as well as subsequent b-scission-oli-
gomerization and cyclization reactions of the resulting olefins are catalyzed by
HZSM-5. The complexity of the aromatization chemistry makes it difficult to
unravel reaction mechanisms; hence, mechanistic information is largely
derived from interpreting experimental product distributions in terms of carbo-
cationic chemistry. Recent quantum chemical studies and kinetic modeling
efforts have gone a long way in elucidating the elementary reactions and their
relative significance for this chemistry. This section focuses on the mechanistic
and modeling literature for light paraffin aromatization over HZSM-5.
The general features of light alkane activation, including oxidative routes
as well as conversions into alkenes or aromatics was reviewed by Scurrell (96)
in 1987. This review provides thermodynamic and kinetic considerations and
addresses the early work regarding HZSM-5 catalysts. In an excellent review
on this topic Seddon (97) has discussed the early dehydrocyclodimerization
work from Csiscery (98), the early patent literature from Mobil and British Pet-
roleum, the thermodynamics of the reaction, as well as initial reports on the
promotional effect of zinc and gallium to reduce the production of methane
and ethane. Ono (99) has reviewed the activation of C2-C6 alkanes on HZSM-
5 and Ga- and Zn-modified ZSM-5 materials and discussed mechanistic impli-
cations based on the product distribution obtained. Similarly, Guisnet and
Gnep (1, 100) have also reviewed the early literature on this subject and
have commented on the role of gallium and the synergism between gallium
and Brnsted acid sites. More recently, Hagen and Roessner (101) have dis-
cussed ethane aromatization, in particular the effect of zinc and gallium as pro-
moters for HZSM-5, the stability of the catalyst, and the reaction mechanism as
postulated based on the product distribution. In a recent publication, Caeiro
et al. (102) have reviewed C2-C4 activation over acid and bifunctional catalysis
and provide a broad overview of the aromatization and alkylation chemistry.
Each of these reviews primarily addresses mechanistic implications based on
the observed product distribution and typically address in detail only alkane
activation. We do not intend to reproduce the various comparative studies
described in the reviews above, instead we focus on individual reaction types
for this chemistry and address mechanistic issues with significant input from
ab initio calculations. Another focus of our presentation is to critically
address various modeling approaches to these complicated hydrocarbon
systems that have been proposed in the literature.

Chemistry of Propane Aromatization on HZSM-5
The reaction chemistry of propane aromatization is comprised of numerous
successive steps. As mentioned above, in this complex series-parallel reaction

system, the mechanistic conclusions presented are largely drawn from
observed product distributions. Our objective is to discuss what the reaction
steps involved in these complex pathways are and how they occur.
3.1.1.
Alkane Activation
Since this mechanism involves the initiation of the reactant, it can often be
isolated experimentally and has also been extensively studied using quantum
chemistry tools. Having already discussed the phenomena relevant for the
interaction of non-polar alkanes with microporous materials in section 2.2,
we describe the cracking, dehydrogenation and H/D exchange reactions of
alkanes catalyzed by solid acids in this section with a focus on studies done
on HZSM-5.
McVicker et al. (87) studied the conversion of isobutane over amorphous
solid acids such as SiO2-Al2O3, halided-Al2O3 as well as zeolitic materials
like USY. The observed product distribution on amorphous solid acids was con-
sistent with that expected from radical-cation intermediates, with no isomeri-
zation of isobutane to n-butane occurring. Direct C-C bond cleavage of
isobutane to methane and propylene as well as the absence of secondary
hydride transfer reactions was observed. This led the authors to state, a
surface bound radical cation is envisioned to be formed by the one-electron oxi-
dation of isobutane by an electron acceptor site (EA) on the surface of solid
acids. The elementary step for the activation of isobutane was postulated to
occur as shown in Eq. (1), however, no experimental evidence for such an
electron acceptor was presented.

The oxidizing ability of the solid and the ease of electron transfer from iso-
butane to the solid acid were postulated to be responsible for differences in
reactivity amongst solid acid catalysts. Bizreh and Gates (103) also observed
product distributions in accordance with those observed by McVicker et al.
(87) for the cracking of n-butane and isobutane and also concluded that the
product distribution was unlike that expected from acid-catalyzed cracking.
By contrast, Haag and Dessau (104) in analogy with Olah (105) postulated
a mechanism involving the protonation of alkanes by the solid acids. The Haag-
Dessau mechanism emerged from the observed product distribution for
3-methylpentane (3-MP) and n-hexane cracking over HZSM-5, Y-zeolite, and
amorphous silica-alumina solid acid catalysts. Paraffins at low to moderate
conversions were used as diagnostic tools as they undergo little if any second-
ary reactions. The observed product distribution when extrapolated to zero
conversion resulted in substantial yields of hydrogen, methane and ethane.
These products could not be accounted for by the classical cracking mechanism,
for which the smallest paraffinic product formed by b-scission of carbenium

ions is propane. Haag and Dessau hence postulated the reaction scheme shown
in Figure 1 whereby carbonium ion transition states were proposed to collapse
into three pairs of products, each consisting of an alkane (or hydrogen) and an
adsorbed carbenium ion.
In a parallel study, Corma and coworkers (106) also arrived at a similar
conclusion when studying the cracking of n-heptane on rare-earth (RE)HY
zeolite. They observed a paraffin to olefin ratio significantly in excess of one,
in contrast to the classical b-scission cracking mechanism which gives a
paraffin to olefin ratio of unity. These experimental observations, semi-empiri-
cal calculations of non-classical penta-coordinated gas phase carbonium ions
and heptane cracking selectivity ratios of C6/C1, C5/C2 and C4/C3 of 1 on
HZSM-5 led the authors to postulate monomolecular cracking of C7 (107).
In the first few years following the publication of the Haag-Dessau mechan-
ism, there was significant dispute in the literature, with McVicker and Kramer
(108) arguing that the constancy of the [H2  C4 olefins] to [CH4  C3H8] ratio
over non-zeolitic catalysts having a wide range of activity was difficult to recon-
cile. Hall et al. (109) pointed out that the available data were completely con-
sistent with the Haag-Dessau hypothesis. They argued that the observed
transition from first order to second order kinetics is consistent with the
more facile reactions of the olefinic products formed upon initiation of
alkanes, resulting in second order kinetics at higher conversions. The above
arguments from Hall and coworkers combined with several other experimental
studies reporting product distributions consistent with carbonium ion tran-
sition states described below, as well as results from theoretical calculations
summarized below, reinforce the essential correctness of the Haag-Dessau
mechanism.
Subsequent to the Haag-Dessau work in 1984, a number of authors have
presented product distribution data confirming the protolytic cracking mech-
anism. Krannila et al. (110) reported conversion of n-butane catalyzed by
HZSM-5 consistent with the Haag-Dessau protolytic cracking mechanism
with
H2  butenes;
methane  propylene;
and
ethane  ethylene
being
formed in primary reactions in approximately a one-to-one ratio. Narbeshuber
et al. (111) also reported product distributions consistent with the Haag-Dessau
Figure 1: Protolytic cracking and dehydrogenation of 3-methylpentane adapted from
Haag et al. [104].

mechanism in their investigation of C3-C6 reactivity over HZSM-5. Bandiera
and Taarit (112) obtained equimolar amounts of methane and ethene for
propane conversion (,3%) over HZSM-5. Stefanadis et al. (113) investigated
the cracking of isobutane on HZSM-5 and observed nearly equimolar
amounts of propene and methane in the limit of zero conversion. Several
other researchers have also observed product distributions in line with the
decomposition of a carbonium-ion-like species. We site these references (114
123) and refer the reader to two excellent short reviews (124, 125) that detail
additional evidence in favor of the Haag-Dessau mechanism.
The observed product distribution for the experimental studies shows a
cracking-to-dehydrogenation ratio close to 3, in other words C-C bond
cleavage is found to be more facile compared to C-H bond cleavage. Narbeshu-
ber et al. (111) studied the monomolecular conversion of C3-C6 alkanes over
HZSM-5 under experimental conditions (weight of catalyst, partial pressure
of reactant, flow rate of gas stream) adjusted to maintain differential conver-
sion. Unimolecular kinetics was observed, and selectivities as well as
apparent energies of activation were found to be independent of the
pressure. The rates of cracking and dehydrogenation were observed to expo-
nentially increase with carbon number. After consideration of the enhanced
adsorption due to increasing chain length of the hydrocarbon, however, it
was noted that the true activation energy of C-C bond cleavage was indepen-
dent of carbon number. Similar observations regarding the significant effect
of alkane adsorption on observed energetics of alkane activation on various
zeolite types have also been made by other researchers (126130). The
apparent energies of activation were found to increase in the sequence
hydrogen exchange , dehydrogenation , cracking for all carbon numbers.
The rates of reaction however, increased in the sequence dehydrogenation ,
cracking ,
, hydrogen exchange. Since the hydrogen-bonded alkane rep-
resents the precursor state for each of the three reactions, the difference in
selectivities can only be accounted for by considering different transition
states for each of these reactions. In a related study, Lercher et al. (131) have
proposed three different carbonium-ion-like transition state structures to
account for H/D exchange, protolytic cracking and protolytic dehydrogenation
as shown in Figure 2. From the proposed transition state structures, the lower
rate observed for dehydrogenation in the experimental study by Narbeshuber
et al. (111) can be rationalized in terms of the transition state for dehydrogena-
tion closely resembling the more tightly bound alkoxide product species hence
resulting in high entropy loss and a low pre-exponential factor. These studies,
as well as other ab initio calculations discussed later in this section, suggest
that the idea of a single carbonium-ion transition state for C-H and C-C bond
cleavage is perhaps an over-simplification.
In a series of studies, researchers (132134) have used isotopic tracer
techniques to study propane activation on HZSM-5. 13C tracer studies of

propane-2-13C gave a product distribution containing a random number of 13C
atoms, thereby suggesting that several oligomerization-cracking cycles were
part of a single catalytic turnover. H/D exchange was observed for D2/C3H8,
C3D8/C3H8 and CD4/C3H8 mixtures. For both D2/C3H8 and CD4/C3H8
mixtures, a statistical H/D ratio corresponding to the number of gas phase
hydrogen or deuterium atoms was observed; also, isotopomer concentrations
for each product were observed to be binomial, thereby suggesting that all
products statistically sample the composition of a common surface hydrogen
pool. The faster stepwise transfer between C3D8/C3H8 compared to D2/C3H8
mixtures was taken to be evidence for slower hydrogen adsorption-desorption
steps required to dissociate D-D bonds compared to C-D bond activation. The
appearance of D-atoms in the reaction products was considered to represent
C-D and D-D bond activation, with D2 dissociation being the microscopic
reverse of the recombinative desorption to remove hydrogen. Identical rates
of C-H bond cleavage on HZSM-5 and Ga/HZSM-5 calculated from the deuter-
ium content in C3D8/C3H8 mixtures, but an increase by a factor of three in the
propane conversion turnover rates over Ga/HZSM-5, led the authors to
conclude that C-H bond cleavage cannot limit the propane conversion rate.

of H2 leads to one H-atom that is mobile on HZSM-5, was calculated to be
216 kPa, while the gas phase pressure was less than 1 kPa. Hence, the
authors concluded that recombinative desorption of hydrogen limits alkane
aromatization on HZSM-5. These studies however, do not provide evidence
for the nature of the adsorbed hydrogen species on the surface of the catalyst
or propose structures for the mobile and immobile hydrogen species. Addition-
ally, if hydrogen recombinative desorption was limiting under these reaction
conditions, the observed reaction order for propane would be zero, while most
experimental studies observe first-order kinetics with respect to propane. In
these studies, H-D scrambling was taken to be representative of H2 activation
and C-H bond activation. In light of recent quantum chemical studies described
later in this section, this assumption does not seem to be valid.
Narbeshuber and coworkers have also used isotopic labeling to investigate
alkane dehydrogenation and H/D exchange reactions (135, 136). Isotopic tran-
sient experiments were comprised of switching n-C4H10 with n-C4D10 and
monitoring the steady-state product distribution. The concentration of
n-C4H10 was observed to decrease in parallel with that of the tracer krypton
gas. The concentrations of C2H6, C3H6, and i-C4H8 were observed to decrease
in parallel with n-C4H10, while the responses of molecules containing deuter-
ium atoms were observed to pass through maxima in parallel with the
fraction of deuterium atoms in the product. This confirms the stepwise
exchange of the deuterium atoms of the hydrocarbons with the Brnsted acid
sites of the zeolite. Additionally, the deuterium distribution in the product mol-
ecules could be described by a binomial distribution, indicating that the single
exchange events were independent of each other. The rate of H/D exchange
was found to be an order of magnitude faster than the rates of cracking and
dehydrogenation implying that H-D scrambling is an independent elementary
step and that the rate of H-D exchange may not be indicative of the rate of C-C
bond activation for protolytic cracking or C-H bond activation for dehydrogena-
tion reactions. An isotope effect was also observed for the protolytic cracking
reaction, the rate of cracking of n-C4H10 being 1.7 times faster than that of
n-C4D10 and the initial rate of cracking for a surface covered with deuterium
atoms that was fed n-C4H10 was also 1.7 times lower than a surface covered
with hydrogen atoms. Since, the ratio observed was identical for the two
isotopic switching events shown in Eq. (2), the authors concluded that
cleavage of the O-H bond of the zeolite was rate limiting for the cracking
reaction.

The lack of a similar kinetic isotope effect for dehydrogenation suggested that
deprotonation of the zeolite did not play a role in the rate determining step of
protolytic dehydrogenation. The authors suggest that the rate limiting step for

dehydrogenation is the desorption of the alkoxide intermediate formed upon
C-H bond cleavage, consistent with the increase in apparent activation
energy with carbon number for alkane dehydrogenation observed by Narbe-
shuber et al. (111). Co-feeding n-C4H10 and n-C4D10 showed that the deuterium
distribution in butane was different from that in butenes. This result is in
agreement with the work of Iglesia and coworkers and suggests that the dehy-
drogenation/hydrogenation equilibrium is not established under reaction
conditions.
In a separate series of experiments, pressure transient response exper-
iments were carried out for n-C4H10 to monitor the dependence of cracking
and dehydrogenation as a function of time on stream (136). The reactant and
cracking products were observed to reach steady state shortly after the
tracer krypton gas, while the dehydrogenation response was observed to
have a maximum at short times on stream followed by a decrease to its
steady state value. The H2 production was observed to reach steady state
immediately upon increasing the n-C4H10 pressure from 0 to 4 kPa, in
contrast to the behavior observed for butenes. The reverse transient, i.e.,
switching from butane to helium, showed an immediate cessation of
hydrogen production implying that the H2 produced from the dehydrogenation
reaction resulting in the overshoot must remain on the surface and desorb
slowly. This short time hydrogen storage behavior was verified by repeating
the overshoot after some time; the regeneration time enabling the surface to
be free of hydrogen. The initial high activity for dehydrogenation resulted in
transient behavior and was not observed after short times on stream. The
authors speculate that this short time dehydrogenation proceeds on extrafra-
mework Al sites and, in agreement with Iglesia and coworkers (132) and
Biscardi et al. (137139), that the recombinative desorption of hydrogen
adatoms from these sites is rate limiting. This mechanism however, is con-
sidered to only account for the short time dehydrogenation behavior of the
catalyst and is considered to have a negligible contribution at steady state.
Recent quantum chemical studies by Fa
rcas
iu and Lukinskas (140, 141)
have also postulated a dehydrogenation role for extralattice Al species.
13C isotopic labeling experiments of propane (133) and butane (136) also give
product distributions consistent with monomolecular cracking of alkanes with
chain growth processes that involve rapid oligomerization/cracking cycles.
The identical rates of 1,4-13C2-n-butane and 12C4-n-butane conversion over
HZSM-5 ruled out the preferential cleavage of specific C-C bonds.
Derouane and coworkers have used 13C MAS NMR to study the early
stages of propane-2-13C activation over HZSM-5 (142144). These experiments
were typically conducted at 573 K although the NMR spectra were recorded
only after cooling the cell down to 293 K. Initially, only 13C scrambling in
propane, in absence of any significant other reaction products was observed.
The initial rate of scrambling was found to correlate with the concentration

and strength of Brnsted sites while no correlation with the concentration of
Lewis acid sites was observed. A dependence of the primary labeled products
was found on the propane partial pressure. At low partial pressures the mono-
molecular dehydrogenation of C3H9
, formed by interaction of propane with the
zeolite Brnsted acid site, led to the production of hydrogen and 2-propenium
ions which can desorb forming propylene and restoring the Brnsted acid
sites. The observation of C2 and C4 hydrocarbons as primary products was
accounted for by considering that at high partial pressures, C3H9
 carbonium
ions reacted with other propane molecules to give ethane and butonium ions.
Hence, the carbonium ion transition state could further evolve in four different
ways as shown in Figure 3, leading to the 13C scrambling in propane, cracking,
dehydrogenation and disproportionation. Luzgin et al. (145) have also demon-
strated unimolecular scrambling of 13C in butane and propane using 13C and
1H MAS NMR although n-C4 to i-C4 isomerization reactions were proposed to
occur via bimolecular oligomerization-cracking cycles.
Stepanov and Freude (146) observed both methyl (CH3) and methylene
(CH2) groups to undergo H-D exchange in in situ 1H MAS NMR studies of
C3D8-loaded HZSM-5. A 3:1 ratio between the intensities of the CH3 and
CH2 evidenced against the formation of an intermediate propenium cationic
species that would have led to regiospecific H/D exchange with protium enrich-
ment in the methyl group. Co-adsorption of propylene resulted in a decrease in
H/D exchange for methyl and methylene groups, contrary to what is expected
for a carbenium ion mechanism. Additional co-adsorption experiments of water

or CO molecules, which interact with Brnsted acid sites of the zeolite, also
resulted in a decreased rate of exchange. Based on the above experiments, in
agreement with Haag-Dessau mechanism, the exchange reaction was con-
sidered to occur via a pentavalent transition state. The apparent activation
energies obtained for the exchange of methyl groups (108 + 7 kJ/mol) and
methylene groups (117 + 7 kJ/mol) are in good agreement with computational
studies (147). More recent work from these authors (145) used isotopically
labeled propane with the deuterium isotope in either the methyl (propane-
1,1,1,3,3,3-d6) or methylene (propane-2,2-d2) group and deuterated propane
(C3D8) to study H/D exchange on HZSM-5 using in situ 1H and 13C MAS
NMR. Their results show that methyl and methylene groups both undergo
H-D exchange and intramolecular hydrogen transfer between methyl and
methylene groups measured by the 13C-label scrambling in propane is one
order of magnitude slower than the hydrogen exchange of either methyl or
methylene groups with the zeolite Brnsted acid sites.
Truitt et al. (69) have also used NMR methods to demonstrate (i) that
alkanes interact with zeolites at Brnsted acid sites via specific adsorption
complexes that enable (ii) low temperature (273 K) exchange between iso-
butane and the Brnsted acid proton. Simultaneous monitoring of appearance
of protium (H) on products and deuterium (D) on the zeolite enabled the
authors to correlate the kinetic events and obtain a consistent picture of H-D
exchange. Based on analysis of the residual carbon content on the zeolite
(,0.04 per Al) and the lack of an induction period, the authors argued
against minority unsaturated hydrocarbons initiating reaction and proposed
the mechanism shown in Figure 4 for regiospecific H-D exchange between iso-
butane and the catalyst surface.
Quantum chemical calculations have also been extensively employed to
develop mechanistic understanding for alkane activation over zeolitic acid
sites. Initial calculations of H/D exchange by Kramer et al. (147) and Sauer
(148) showed that carbonium ion transition states were involved in the H/D
exchange reaction of methane over an AlO4
2 tetrahedra. Kazansky and co-
workers (149151) provided initial confirmation for the ionicity of the tran-
sition states for H/D exchange, dehydrogenation and cracking. Calculations
from Collins and OMalley (152, 153) also predicted the formation of a carbo-
nium ion species upon proton transfer from the acid site to the paraffin and
detailed the collapse of the resulting free carbonium ion directly to a smaller
alkane and alkene without formation of an intermediate alkoxide adsorbate.
The activation energy values predicted using the semi-empirical and DFT
methods on 1 T and 2 T clusters exceeded experimentally observed values,
however, the qualitative trends predicted by these calculations were correct.
In a series of publications Blaszkowski et al. (154156) have studied the
activation of C-H and C-C bonds by acidic zeolites. Most of these calculations
were done on generic 3 T clusters with application of the local density

approximation (LDA) and using double-z basis sets. Transition states and the
corresponding energy barriers, as well as rate constants using transition
state theory, of H/D exchange, dehydrogenation, cracking and hydride
transfer between methanol and a methoxide group (CH3-zeolite) were evalu-
ated. The computed activation barriers of 118 kJ/mol for H-D exchange,
202 kJ/mol for hydride transfer, 292 kJ/mol for cracking, and 297 kJ/mol for
dehydrogenation, were high when compared to experimental values observed
for ethane. Different carbonium-ion-like transition state structures for each
of the reactions rationalized the different activation energies. For the tran-
sition state (TS) structure corresponding to H/D exchange, one of the carbon
atoms is protonated by the zeolite, while the second carbon atom remains tetra-
hedrally coordinated. The C2H7
 group could be divided into two distinct parts:
a neutral C2H5 fragment and the two hydrogen atoms interacting with two
lattice oxygen atoms (C2H5 bonded to H2
-ZO2). For cracking, the C2H7
group could similarly be divided into two distinct entities: a neutral methane
molecule and a carbenium ion CH3
 species interacting with basic lattice
oxygen atoms of the zeolite. On the same lines, the TS for dehydrogenation

was observed to correspond to a C2H5
 fragment and a neutral H2 molecule.
Using the method described by Kramer and van Santen (18) to vary acidity
by varying terminal Si-H bond lengths, the authors compared the ionicity of
the transition state structures described above. The transition state for H/D
exchange was found to have the highest covalent character. The H/D
exchange reaction was computed to have a large pre-exponential factor, and
in agreement with experimental studies described above was proposed to be
facile in comparison to dehydrogenation or cracking. Calculations at the
B3LYP/6-31G and MP2/6-31G/
/HF/6-31G levels from Esteves et al.
(157) on 3 T clusters have confirmed that the transition state for dehydrogena-
tion exhibits a much higher ionic character than the transition state for H/D
exchange. More recent studies from Zheng and Blowers (158) done on 3 T
clusters have also confirmed that H-D exchange is faster than dehydrogenation
or cracking for C1-C4 alkanes. All the above calculations were performed either
on clusters, where the terminal silicon or hydrogen atoms were not fixed to rep-
resent a particular crystallographic framework or on small clusters (less than 5
T atoms). Recent theoretical studies for alkene chemisorption have shown the
importance (85, 159) of local zeolite geometry on the stability of the alkoxide
intermediate which the above studies are not well suited to capture.
Zygmunt et al. (160) have presented an ab initio and density functional
study for ethane cracking over HZSM-5 on a 5 T cluster at the HF, B3LYP
and MP2(fc) levels of theory using the 6-31G(d) basis set. The effect of
cluster size on the computed activation barrier was investigated by using
larger clusters (up to 58 T) with rigid experimental geometries wherein geome-
tries from the 5 T cluster were embedded in much larger zeolitic clusters with
no further geometry optimization. The activation barrier was found to be sen-
sitive to long-range effects; embedding within a 58 T cluster led to a 60 kJ/mol
reduction in the activation barrier from the value calculated for a 5 T cluster.
The calculated activation barrier of 210225 kJ/mol with the 58 T cluster is
in good agreement with experimental values (111). The significant change in
the activation energy induced by long-range electrostatic effects was attributed
to the polar zeolite framework stabilizing the charged transition state (0.9 e) to
a greater extent relative to the neutral alkoxide species or the physisorbed
ethane molecule. An alternative way of considering the same physical phenom-
ena is that the transition state has a much larger dipole moment compared to
the adsorbed complex, and hence, in presence of the electric field of the zeolite,
its energy is reduced much more compared to the resulting adsorbate complex.
This study clearly demonstrates the effects of cluster size on computed energy
values and emphasizes the need for embedded cluster type computational tech-
niques for obtaining an accurate energetic picture in these systems. In light of
this work, some recent studies involving embedded QM/MM techniques (161)
and molecular dynamics with quantum forces (162) have confirmed the strong
polarization effects of the zeolite cavity.

In summary, the Haag-Dessau mechanism for protolytic activation of the
alkane via penta-coordinated carbonium-ion-like transition states explains
the observed product distribution. Experimental studies show different rates
for H/D exchange, C-H bond cleavage, and C-C bond cleavage, and also
address the crucial role of alkane adsorption in determining the intrinsic
reaction rates. Theoretical studies have shown different transition state struc-
tures for these reactions and hence provided a basis for rationalizing differ-
ences in measured experimental rates for these reactions. The current
challenge lies in extending this understanding to longer and branched hydro-
carbon molecules, both experimentally and theoretically.
3.1.2.
Olefin Adsorption
As discussed in Section 2.4., initial work from McVicker and coworkers,
NMR studies from Gorte and coworkers as well as Haw and coworkers, and
theoretical studies from Kazansky and coworkers have established the for-
mation of neutral alkoxide structures upon olefin adsorption in zeolites. We
extend that discussion here and focus only on the olefin adsorption studies.
As discussed in section 2.2., paraffin adsorption in zeolites has been well
studied experimentally, however, for unsaturated olefinic molecules, inter-
action with Brnsted acid sites often results in oligomerization. Hence, exper-
imental measurements for olefin adsorption are challenging and are typically
undertaken at low temperatures and low pressures to minimize secondary
reactions.
Spoto et al. (163) studied ethene and propene oligomerization on HZSM-5
using FTIR spectroscopy while collecting 7 interferograms per second at
4 cm21 resolution. The fast collection enabled the adsorption process to be cate-
gorized into three intervals (A) immediately after dosage up to a contact time
not exceeding 10s, that probes the structure of the primary interaction, (B)
up to a contact time of 1.5 minutes, that probes the initial stages of oligomeriza-
tion, and (C) up to several hours, that discusses the long time behavior of the
reaction. In regime (A), a frequency shift for the Brnsted acid sites
(3610 cm21 band) and the ethylene molecule were found, while no perturbation
of the external silanol groups (3746 cm21 band) was observed. The observed
perturbations were attributed to the formation of a 1:1 p-complex as shown
in Figure 5; resulting in a red-shift of 389 cm21 for the O-H Brnsted acid
site stretching frequency and reduced symmetry of the adsorbed C2H4 as
well as reduced density of charge on the carbon-carbon double bond
(measured by the 11 cm21 downward shift of the n(C5
5C) bond). The short
term oligomerization data showed the appearance of characteristic modes of
CH3 and CH2 saturated groups, indicating that protonation and polymeriz-
ation processes have occurred. The absence of -CH(CH3)2 and -C(CH3)3
species inferred from the IR spectra as well as the high intensity ratio
I(CH2)/I(CH3) and noting that the specific intensity is higher for CH3 groups

indicated that primarily linear species were formed in the initial time period of
7-30 s. Similar observations regarding the propensity of HZSM-5 to form linear
products have been postulated on the basis of NMR studies (89). At longer
times on stream, oligomeric products with branched chains could also be dis-
cerned. For propylene a higher red-shift (from 3610 cm21 to 3070 cm21) as
well as considerably more oligomerization was found.
On the basis of isotopic H/D labeling studies at low temperatures some
researchers (164169) suggest a more complex energy profile for olefin adsorp-
tion. The proposed energy profile involves interaction of the alkyl group with
the Brnsted acid site (I), non-activated transition from this state to a state
where the alkene molecule interacts primarily with the zeolite walls (II), an
un-activated transition from state (II) to a complex involving interaction of
the alkyl group with the Brnsted acid site (III), and finally an activated tran-
sition from state (III) to the p-complex involving interaction of the olefinic
double bond with the Brnsted acid site. In agreement with other researchers
(90, 93), these authors also find alkenyl carbenium ions upon adsorption of
cyclic compounds where delocalization and steric considerations result in
stable carbenium ion like species. The reader is referred to an excellent
review of carbenium ion species in zeolites by Kiricsi et al. for additional infor-
mation on this topic (170).
Kofke and Gorte (40) have used temperature-programmed desorption
(TPD) and thermogravimetric analysis (TPD-TGA) with gas chromatographic
analysis to study the low-temperature reaction of ethene, propene and
2-methyl-2-propanol in HZSM-5. Propene was observed to oligomerize at
295 K, 2-methyl-2-propanol was also observed to adsorb and dehydrate at
295 K, while ethylene reacted only at temperatures higher than 370 K. Essen-
tially identical TPD product distributions from all three adsorbates suggested
that the cracking and alkylation of similar oligomeric species was involved.
Although these studies cannot directly examine the nature of the surface

species on the catalyst, the observed product distribution was consistent with
carbenium ion reactions.
Following the initial pioneering work from Kazansky and coworkers, a
number of ab initio studies have addressed the protonation of olefinic molecules
in zeolites. Viruela-Martin et al. (171) showed that propene and isobutene
adsorption on zeolites involved the formation of a p-complex that is transformed
to an alkoxide species by a carbenium-ion-like transition state (SCF/3-21G level
of theory on a 3 T cluster). The mechanism involved two lattice oxygen atoms,
and hence, the authors concluded that Brnsted acidic centers should always
be considered in conjunction with neighboring basic lattice oxygen sites. The
computed physisorption energies matched up well with experimental values,
however, the activation energy calculated far exceeded values obtained by
Aronson et al. (89). Even though the terminal atoms were not constrained to
mimic a particular zeolite framework, the authors mention that heterogeneity
of sites within a zeolite structure may arise due to varying local geometry. Sig-
nificantly higher activation energies compared to measured experimental
values were also reported by Evleth et al. (172) for ethylene, propylene, and
acetylene adsorption on small 1 T and 2 T zeolite clusters using AM1 and
PM3 semi-empirical methods and ab initio MP2/6-31G level calculations.
In a combined theoretical (at the DFT level of theory using a 6 T cluster)
and 13C MAS NMR experimental study, Nicholas et al. (173) have addressed
the interaction of propene with various solid acid catalysts. In agreement
with other theoretical studies described, the authors predict the formation of
a physisorbed p-complex and an alkoxide species upon proton transfer with
the net charge on the C3H7 fragment to be 0.44 e. The NMR experiments
show that propene does not undergo complete label scrambling in HZSM-5
demonstrating that the isopropyl cation does not exist in the zeolite cavity in
contrast to true superacids such as SbF5 and AlBr3 that result in complete
label scrambling.
Rigby et al. (84, 174) have shown that the four different alkoxides of
methylbutane have similar energies, with no particular ordering reflecting
their primary, secondary and tertiary nature. The differences in activation
energies for the adsorption of propene as primary and secondary alkoxides of
27 kJ/mol and iso-butene as primary and tertiary alkoxides of 50 kJ/mol,
were significantly greater than the corresponding reaction heats of 12.5 and
15.5 kJ/mol. The authors suggest that the broad predictions of the carbenium
ion model are successful due to an ordering of the transition states rather than
an ordering of the neutral alkoxide species. Similar observations about neutral
alkoxide intermediates, bifunctional nature of the active site, as well as reactiv-
ity being dictated by the carbenium ion characteristics of the transition state
have been made by other researchers (86, 175, 176).
For the protonation of ethene, propene, 1-butene, and iso-butene on uni-
dimensional theta-1 zeolite Boronat et al. (85, 95) observed a destabilization

of the alkoxide intermediates compared to the physisorbed p-complex. The
formation of the covalent C-O bond was hindered due to enforced structural
constraints of the rigid zeolite lattice, and hence, the authors cautioned
against comparing adsorption energies on structurally different zeolites. Acti-
vation energies on the other hand, did not show a significant dependence on the
local geometry of the active site because unlike alkoxide adsorbed species, tran-
sition states were found to have high ionic character and therefore were mainly
stabilized by the negative potential of the zeolite wall. A DFT study by Correa
and Mota (159) has also confirmed the significance of steric effects on the stab-
ility of the alkoxy species. A comparison for the protonation of butene isomers
on a generic 3T cluster showed that the t-alkoxy species was the least stable
adsorbate. While local structural effects are observed to destabilize the
alkoxide species, the inclusion of long range Madelung effects has been
shown to enhance the stability of the alkoxide species (177).
Rozanska et al. (178) have presented a systematic study for understanding
relaxation effects pertaining to the local environment of the active site when
studying propene chemisorption in acidic chabazite. The authors compare
the energy of the p-complex, the activation barrier, and the alkoxide
complex, for a fully relaxed cluster and for a cluster when all the zeolite
atoms except the aluminum and the four oxygen atoms around it, are fixed.
The physisorption energy was not affected by cluster relaxation, however,
the activation energy increased from 57 to 91 kJ/mol upon constraining the
zeolite lattice. This results in the transition from the adsorbed p-complex to
the adsorbed alkoxide species becoming endothermic, an observation also
made by Benco et al. (179). Although no single bond distance, bond angle or
dihedral angle was identified as the primary cause, this study also demon-
strates that the adsorbate configuration and corresponding charge density,
and heat of adsorption are sensitive to the local zeolite structure. In another
study, Rozanska et al. (180) have compared isobutene chemisorption on chaba-
zite (CHA), ZSM-22 (TON) and mordenite (MOR) and shown that short-range
electrostatic contributions are important for the stabilization of the carbocatio-
nic transition state. The activation energy was found to be the smallest in the
case of an optimum fit of the transition state complex shape with zeolite micro-
pore size. Hence, large pore zeolites like MOR may stabilize the transition state
only to a limited extent, while small pore zeolites may induce steric constraints
to destabilize the transition state.
Recently, our work (27) on alkoxide formation from propene and hexene in
HZSM-5 has addressed the effects of carbon number, proton siting, aluminum
siting, and bonding configuration (primary versus secondary) of the alkoxide
intermediate. We report a novel reaction path for propene chemisorption,
whereby the primary alkoxide is bonded to the Brnsted host oxygen rather
than a neighboring lattice oxygen. We also observe different alkoxide adsorp-
tion energies at different lattice positions (Aluminum substitution at the T4

versus T12 sites) in HZSM-5, thereby confirming that the energy of the adsor-
bate depends on the local zeolite geometry. In agreement with Rozanska et al.
(178) we also find changes in the first shell of oxygen atoms surrounding the
aluminum site at the transition state geometry and note that the aluminum
hosting the Brnsted site or the alkoxide always has a longer Al-O bond
length. Recent in situ EXAFS experiments for ethene chemisorption on H-Y
zeolite, from van Bokhoven et al. (181) have also confirmed a 0.2 A
 longer
aluminum-oxygen bond length for the oxygen that binds the proton, in excel-
lent agreement with our theoretical predictions.
In summary, although experimental and theoretical studies have con-
firmed that olefin adsorption occurs in a concerted manner, with proton
transfer from the Brnsted acid site onto a carbon atom of the olefin double
bond with the simultaneous formation of the C-O bond, it has now become
apparent that the activation barriers and adsorbate complexes are a function
of the local zeolite geometry. Hence, measured experimental values or those
calculated based on kinetic models probably represent an average value. In
general, if the charge on the basic zeolite lattice oxygen atom is not sterically
inaccessible alkoxide intermediates are formed; however, the delocalization
of charge is a function of the local geometry of the zeolite and hydrocarbon
species that exist as alkoxides in a particular zeolite may exist as carbenium
ions in another.
3.1.3.
b-scission/Oligomerization
Olefin interconversion and cyclization are known to occur at temperatures
in the range 473673 K on HZSM-5, indicating the much higher reactivity of
olefins compared to the corresponding paraffins. Cracking of olefins at the
higher temperatures used for light paraffin aromatization (773 K) presents
experimental challenges due to high reaction rates. The term conjunct polymer-
ization was coined by Pines (182) to describe the products of acid-catalyzed
reactions of olefins involving successive oligomerization/cracking cycles. An
example of the complexity of this chemistry can be seen from the work of
Quann et al. (183).
Abbot and Wojciechowski (184) studied the cracking of C5-C9 alkenes on
HZSM-5 at 678 K, and based on the observed product distributions, concluded
that pentene and hexene cracked by a dimerization-cracking route, while C7-C9
could undergo unimolecular cracking. Bessel and Seddon (185) found that
ethene and propene conversion over HZSM-5 involves successive oligomeriza-
tion/cracking cycles resulting in the formation of intermediate C4 and C5
olefins. In studying the isomerization and hydrocracking of C9-C16 paraffins
on a Pt/HZSM-5 catalyst, Weitkamp et al. (186) introduced terminology
which is useful in organizing the various types of C-C bond cleavage reactions
for carbenium ions. Buchanan et al. (187) have further extended this nomencla-
ture and have studied the relative rates of various types of b-scission reactions

Downloaded by [Harvard College] at 06:34 18 August 2013 
for C5-C8 olefins over HZSM-5 at 783 K under low hydrocarbon partial pressure
conditions and high silica/alumina (SiO2/Al2O3  650) ratios to minimize the
effects of bimolecular reactions. For each feed, Buchanan et al. (187) have
enumerated all the plausible b-scission reactions and related these steps to
the observed product distribution to obtain relative rates for the various
modes of b-scission. The appreciable abundance of isomers prior to appreciable
cracking of the olefin feed evidenced the facile adsorption/desorption process
for olefins relative to cracking. The product distribution for hexene and
heptene was found to be independent of the particular olefin fed, indicating
that isomerization was rapid compared to cracking. For C8 olefins the
observed product distribution could not be rationalized by the most energeti-
cally favored tertiary-tertiary cracking mechanism due to steric hindrance in
forming the highly branched C8 structure within the zeolite pores. Although
only relative rates for the various modes of b-scission are presented, this excel-
lent study allows for a semi-quantitative description of the b-scission reaction
in terms of carbenium ion mechanisms based on the observed product distri-
bution for C5-C8 olefins.
Rigby et al. (84), Frash and van Santen (188), and Frash et al. (189) have
investigated the mechanism of the b-scission reaction using DFT and ab initio
Hartree-Fock calculations. On generic 1T and 3T clusters, complex potential
energy surfaces for the cracking of but-1-oxy and pent-1-oxy were found.
Three possible reaction paths were found: one-step via the ringlike tran-
sition state (RL); two-step via the hydrogen-bonded transition state and sub-
stituted cyclopropane (HBCP); and one-step via the hydrogen-bonded
transition state (HB). The lowest energy path was the HBCP pathway that
warrants initial formation of the new C-C bond followed by simultaneous
cleavage of two C-C bonds. The existence of a cyclopropane species has also
been proposed by Sie (190192) to explain the observed product distribution
for cracking of longer chain paraffinic molecules. Van Santen et al. found
the transition state to possess significant ionic character (0.8 e), while the
reactants and products were found to be neutral alkoxide species (0.4 e).
Activation energies were found to decrease with increasing carbon number.
The activation barrier however, was overestimated in each case due to the
small clusters used.
Hay et al. (193) investigated the b-scission of pentene and branched methyl
pentene in the gas phase as well as after adsorption on a generic 3 T cluster
using the HF/6-31G and B3LYP/6-31G methods. Branching was calculated
to result in a decrease of 25 kJ/mol for the activation barrier, while the
overall reaction was endothermic in the amount of 80 kJ/mol for both mol-
ecules. The activation barriers calculated were of the order of 230 kJ/mol
and are significantly higher than values calculated from experimental studies.
Svelle et al. (194) found concerted and stepwise mechanisms for the dimer-
ization of ethene, propene, 1-butene, and trans-2-butene over a generic 4 T

cluster at the B3LYP/6-31G(d) level of theory. The stepwise mechanism
involves the interaction of an adsorbed alkoxide intermediate with an olefin,
while the concerted mechanism postulates that protonation and C-C bond for-
mation occur simultaneously with the initial state being two physisorbed
olefinic molecules. The activation energy for the concerted mechanism was
found to lie between the two barriers of the stepwise mechanism, which
suggests that the concerted dimerization mechanism would be prevalent.
However, if the chemisorption reaction to form the alkoxide, for which the
lowest barrier is found, is driven to completion, then every acidic site has an
adsorbed alkoxide and the concerted route is blocked. The energy barrier for
the step-wise reaction is high simply because alkoxide formation results in
an energy well from which further progress of the reaction requires overcoming
a significant energy barrier. Thus, the relative energies of the physisorbed and
chemisorbed alkenes determine the prevalent mechanism, and a general trend
for C2-C4 olefins was not observed. Vos et al. (195) and Arstad et al. (196, 197)
have also proposed a similar concerted reaction pathway involving both
reactant species physisorbed on the Brnsted acid site for alkylation of aro-
matics by olefins. We mention here that each of the theoretical studies
described above was done on clusters that did not specifically mimic any par-
ticular zeolite lattice structure, hence, local relaxation effects that have been
shown to have a significant effect on the energy of the adsorbed alkoxide inter-
mediate, may also significantly alter the energy profile for the b-scission and
oligomerization reactions.
In summary, although the major features of the observed product distri-
bution for the b-scission reaction can be described in terms of carbenium ion
chemistry, theoretical studies have shown that the reaction profile is
complex. Additionally, the effects of local zeolite geometry on the reaction
mechanism and the corresponding energetics have still not been addressed
in the literature.

Hydride Transfer and Alkylation Reactions
Hydride transfer is a bimolecular reaction involved in the chain transfer
process after the formation of the adsorbed alkoxide intermediate and can be
represented as shown in Eq. (3) with H representing the Brnsted acid site
of the zeolite.

To our knowledge this reaction has not been isolated experimentally and
kinetics of hydride transfer steps are typically inferred from kinetic models.
Theoretical studies have in this case been of great utility and have allowed
researchers to gain mechanistic insight as well as kinetic parameters for
these reactions.

Investigators (198201) have studied five examples of the hydride transfer
reaction at the MP2(fc)/6-31G/
/HF/6-31G level of theory on a 1 T
cluster. The examples considered were: (i) methane-methyl (18 ! 18), (ii)
ethyl-ethane (18 ! 18), (iii) s-propyl-propane (28 ! 28), (iv) t-butyl-propane
(38 ! 28), and (v) t-butyl-isobutane (38 ! 38). According to the authors, the
hydride transfer reaction involves the attack of a paraffin on the covalently
bonded surface alkoxide intermediate, resulting in a polarization and
elongation of the C-O alkoxy bond. The activation barriers calculated were
(i) 278 (ii) 236 and (iii)(v) 196200 kJ/mol respectively. The enhanced
steric repulsions due to the bulkier transition state for the 38 ! 28 and
38 ! 38 hydride transfer reactions were attributed to result in similar acti-
vation barriers for (iii)(v). The geometry and charge of the transition state
closely resemble that of a non-classical penta-coordinated carbonium ion
species. At the transition state (see Figure 6) the two molecules are connected
by a central hydrogen atom with small positive or even negative charge, which
gives rise to the hydridic nature of the reaction. Although these studies
were performed on 1 T clusters more representative of alumina sites or extra-
framework aluminum sites and the activation barriers computed were much
higher in comparison with those inferred from kinetic models, these compu-
tational studies represent the first characterization of the hydride transfer
reactions.
Boronat and coworkers (202204) have also investigated hydride transfer
reactions using density functional theory. Initial calculations (202) for (C3H7-
H-C3H7) interacting with a 3 T cluster at the B3PW91/6-31G level of

theory gave a true activation barrier of 138 kJ/mol, in better agreement with
kinetic studies. In a later study, Boronat et al. (204) have studied the (C2H5-
H-C2H5) carbonium ion as a reaction intermediate in presence of a 3 T
cluster. Besides hydride transfer with an activation barrier of 150 kJ/mol at
the B3PW91/6-31G level, and slightly higher (171 kJ/mol) at the MP2
level, the authors also find that an alkylation reaction occurs. Alkylation
here refers to the decomposition of the (C2H5-H-C2H5) carbonium ion
species into an n-butane molecule and regeneration of the Brnsted acid site.
This pathway is found to have an activation barrier similar to that computed
for hydrogen transfer and the overall reaction is thermodynamically favored
due to the 125 kJ/mol exothermicity of the reaction (see Figure 7). The
rearrangement required for formation of CH4 and C3H7
 via the disproportiona-
tion reaction was however, found to be energetically unfavorable. These studies
suggest a common intermediate for hydride transfer, disproportionation and
alkylation reactions between adsorbed olefins and alkanes.
In summary, theoretical calculations have determined initial structures for
activated complexes and associated barriers for hydride transfer reactions,
however, details regarding effects of carbon number, and local zeolite
geometry, hydride transfer reactions involving allylic adsorbed species for
dehydrogenation reactions resulting in the formation of products like
benzene, toluene, etc., have not yet been addressed in the literature.
3.1.5.
Cyclization
Dehydrocyclodimerization, the conversion of light olefins (C2-C4) to aro-
matics is often carried out over bifunctional catalysts containing acidic and
dehydrogenation components. However, cyclization and aromatization also
occur over purely acidic zeolites as well. It is postulated that cyclization

involves an equilibrium between 5- and 6-membered ring species although
5-membered ring species are not observed in any significant concentration in
the product distribution. Experimental verification of the elementary steps
in zeolite catalyzed cyclization mechanisms has remained largely elusive due
to the simultaneous secondary reactions. A general scheme based on carbe-
nium ion chemistry is typically considered, as shown in Figure 8. Cyclization
is presumed to occur with the attack of the positive carbon formed upon proto-
nation of a diene on to the remaining carbon-carbon double bond. The resulting
alkylcyclopenta- carbenium ions then undergoes successive hydride transfer
reactions, forming a stable 38 carbenium ion, which then undergoes ring
expansion.
Based on extensive 13C NMR and theoretical studies for the Methanol-to-
Gasoline (MTG) system, researchers (93, 205208) have shown the existence
of persistent carbenium ions in zeolites. These NMR studies reveal only
cyclic, resonance stabilized tertiary cations to persist on these catalysts and
the authors have postulated these species to be critical surface intermediates
in the hydrocarbon pool mechanism for MTG. Although these species
undergo facile alkylation and dealkylation reactions resulting in C-C bond for-
mation for MTG chemistry, it is not apparent, whether these species are pre-
cursors to formation of C6 and higher aromatics directly or whether ring-
expansion proceeds via other pentacyclic carbenium ion species, particularly
in light of theoretical studies that have predicted a high energy barrier for
cyclization via a tertiary carbenium ion species (207, 209).
Based on semi-empirical calculations for isomerization of the cyclohexy-
lium ion to 1-methycyclopentylium ion and the 1-methylcyclohexylium ion to
1-ethylcyclopentylium ion, Viruela-Martin et al. (210, 211) have postulated
the existence of two slightly different protonated cyclopropane bicyclic inter-
mediates for ring expansion and contraction. Our recent study (209) discusses
various cyclization mechanisms for hexadiene cyclization via carbenium ion
species in absence of the zeolite and confirms the existence of a bicyclo inter-
mediate for ring-expansion.

We briefly discuss our results here and the reader is referred to the original
publication (209) for additional details. We have examined three pathways for
cyclization of the gas phase C6H11
 carbenium ion species shown in Figure 9: (i)
15 ring closure followed by successive hydride transfer reactions to result in a
secondary carbenium ion that undergoes ring expansion via a bicyclic inter-
mediate (ii) 15 ring closure followed by successive hydride transfer reactions
to result in a tertiary carbenium ion that subsequently also undergoes ring
expansion and (iii) direct 1,6 ring closure without the formation of a cyclopentyl
intermediate. For gas phase cyclization investigated at B3LYP/6-311  G(2d,p)
level of theory, we find reaction path (i) to be the preferred pathway due to the
secondary nature of the transition state (Path II shown in Figure 9). Our initial
calculations for C6 alkoxides show that the relative stability of the alkoxide
intermediates
is

We
attribute
this
reversal

ordering
compared to the analogous gas phase species to steric repulsions and hence
longer C-O alkoxy bond lengths for 28 and 38 alkoxide species.

ates undergo 15 ring closure followed by ring expansion. It is observed that

site accessibility and strain in the 5-membered ring species rather than the
primary or secondary nature are the primary drivers for the activation
barrier. Joshi and Thomson have also compared activation barriers for C6, C7
and C8 cyclization (213) and found that 16 ring closure for C6 species has a
29 kJ/mol higher activation energy compared to C7 and C8 species. This
result perhaps explains the high selectivity to toluene observed for propane
aromatization experimentally. We have incorporated relative activation
barriers from the above DFT studies in our microkinetic model (214) and
have successfully predicted the experimentally observed benzene, toluene
and xylene production for propane aromatization over HZSM-5 over a wide
range of space time and temperature values.
We note that although the formation of hexatriene and thermal cyclization
has been noted for noble metal catalysts, in agreement with Meriaudeau and
Naccache (215), we seek to distinguish the mechanism for cyclization over
acidic zeolites from bifunctional noble metal catalysts that form metallocy-
cloalkane intermediates and are efficient for aromatization. Meriaudeau and
Naccache (215) also note that in starting from n-hexane and n-heptane, the
major aromatic products were not benzene and toluene respectively, but were
composed of a mixture of benzene, toluene and xylenes. The chemical compo-
sition was closer to that expected from thermodynamics, implying that ring
closure is not the primary mechanism for aromatics production instead,
several fragmentation and C-C bond formation cycles occur prior to ring
closure.
To summarize, probing cyclization mechanisms remains experimentally
challenging. Recent DFT calculations from Joshi et al. (212) are providing
the initial mechanistic insights for this complex reaction pathway. These
studies enable description of the observed lower selectivity of benzene
compared to toluene and have provided adsorption and activation energies
for kinetic modeling efforts.

Toluene Disproportionation
The acid catalyzed disproportionation of alkylbenzenes has been exten-
sively investigated. The selective disproportionation of toluene to para-
xylene and benzene exploiting the shape-selective characteristics of ZSM-5
has been studied by several researchers (216227). A review of this extensive
literature is beyond the scope of this work, and the reader is referred to two
review publications on the disproportionation reaction of alkylbenzenes
(224, 226) for a broader discussion of this topic. We instead comment briefly
only on studies that attempt to probe the mechanism for this reaction.
Three different mechanisms have been proposed for toluene disproportio-
nation viz., (i) the methyl transfer mechanism (ii) the diphenylmethane mech-
anism
and
(iii)
the
dissociative
mechanism.
These
mechanisms
are

Most of the evidence for these mechanisms is derived from fitting kinetic
models for the observed product distribution, however, rigorous interpretation
of the kinetics is difficult due to concurrent coking and deactivation, and hence
time on stream dependence of the observed kinetics. Xiong et al. (222) have
investigated toluene disproportionation over HZSM-5 using a 1:9 molar ratio
of toluene-a, a, a-d3: toluene to determine the mechanism based on the fate
of the deuterium label. A one-to-one stoichiometry for benzene and xylene
was observed in the product stream as well as an equilibrium distribution of
the three xylene isomers. A primary kinetic isotope effect (kH/kD  1.88) was
noted for the disproportionation reaction and was ascribed by the authors to
a symmetrical linear transition state corresponding to colinearity of the
migrating H between its origin and terminus. Stoichiometric consumption of
diphenylmethane was also observed upon its addition to a toluene feed. The
enhanced rate for reaction upon introduction of diphenylmethane was attribu-
ted to removal of the induction period due to a higher population of chain
carriers. The authors concluded that the large kinetic isotope effect as well
as stoichiometric consumption of diphenylmethane was consistent with mech-
anism (ii).
Rozanska et al. (228, 229) have investigated the intermolecular isomeriza-
tion and transalkylation reaction of aromatic species by acidic zeolites using
computational methods. The direct transalkylation pathway over a 4 T
cluster involves toluene activation to form a phenoxy intermediate, weak
co-adsorption of benzene and reaction of the alkoxy species with the
co-adsorbed benzene. The activation barrier for the direct transalkylation
mechanism was calculated to be 277 kJ/mol. The diphenylmethane intermedi-
ate mechanism is limited by the attack of the zeolite Brnsted acid site on the
methyl group of toluene resulting in the formation of hydrogen and a benzyl
alkoxy species calculated to have an activation barrier of 297 kJ/mol. Sub-
sequent reactions were calculated to be facile as the benzyl alkoxy species is
relatively unstable. Although these calculations do not account for steric
effects of the zeolite, they provide an initial analysis of competitive pathways
involved in transalkylation reactions.
The MTG literature has significantly enhanced our understanding of alky-
lation and dealkylation reactions of cyclic species. 13C MAS NMR and theoreti-
cal studies from Haw and coworkers for the conversion of methanol have shown
the existence of persistent cyclopentenyl cations (207, 208, 230, 231). These
NMR measurements, done in a pulse quench reactor, revealed the 1,3-
dimethylcyclopentenyl carbenium ion to be stable on HZSM-5 and the
authors state that the existence of this intermediate eliminates the observed
kinetic induction period. Based on DFT studies for gas phase species at the
B3LYP/6-311G level of theory (207), these authors note that the diene
species formed upon deprotonation of the above-mentioned pentacyclic cation
has a lower activation barrier for methylation compared to ethylene, propylene

or toluene. The facile alkylation and dealkylation reactions of substituted cyclic
species were hence proposed to result in the formation of C-C bonds for MTG
chemistry. Based on a combined NMR and theoretical study of toluene alky-
lation Ivanova and Corma (232) concluded that physisorbed methanol as well
as methoxy species were able to alkylate toluene, with the rate being faster
for the physisorbed methanol species.
Recent theoretical studies by Vos et al. (195, 233) and Arstad et al. (196)
have proposed a concerted reaction pathway for the alkylation of aromatic mol-
ecules by methanol, ethylene and propene with simultaneous adsorption of the
olefin and the aromatic molecule and alkylation occurring by proton transfer to
the alkene with concurrent C-C bond formation between the alkene and the
aromatic molecule. Subsequently, the acid site is regenerated by H donation
from the aromatic molecule to the zeolite cluster. In general, a lower activation
barrier for the alkylation reaction was noted with increasing substitution on
the aromatic molecule and with propylene as the olefinic reactant compared
to ethylene. The above mechanism stands out in that it does not involve the for-
mation of an alkoxide intermediate and reaction is proposed to occur directly
from physisorbed intermediate species. We note again that 4 T clusters were
employed for each of the above studies and suspect that the energies calculated
in the above studies will change when larger clusters or embedded cluster
methodologies are employed.
In summary, although several modified ZSM-5 formulations have been
developed to enhance the para-selectivity for toluene disproportionation, only
recently theoretical studies have elucidated the novel reaction pathways invol-
ving physisorbed intermediates for alkylation and dealkylation of aromatic
species. We note that the above alkylation and dealkylation reactions could
also represent the disproportionation of alkylaromatics.
3.2.
Kinetic Modeling Studies of Alkane Cracking
As discussed above, hydrocarbon chemistry over acidic zeolites involves a
large number of reactions. Besides alkane activation via a carbocationic tran-
sition state, a number of secondary reactions including hydride transfer,
b-scission/oligomerization, cyclization, etc. are involved. The product distri-
bution for a given feedstock is dependent on the relative rates of elementary
steps under the given reaction conditions and the properties of the solid acid
catalyst. In light of the complexity of crude oil composition and the importance
of fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) to the refining industry, a large number of
studies have been devoted to developing comprehensive and reliable models for
this chemistry to enable extrapolation and optimal plant operation. For an exten-
sive review of the early literature on catalytic cracking the reader is referred to a
review by Corma and Wojciechowski (234). The mechanism of propane aromati-
zation over HZSM-5 catalysts closely resembles that of paraffin cracking over
Propane Aromatization over HZSM-5 and Ga/HZSM-5 Catalysts

Downloaded by [Harvard College] at 06:34 18 August 2013 
solid acid catalysts. An extensive discussion of paraffin cracking mechanisms is
outside the scope of this work however, we present a short review of the
modeling efforts for paraffin cracking, before extending this discussion to
modeling of propane aromatization over ZSM-5 based catalysts.
For describing the chemistry of petroleum mixtures with thousands of
distinct molecular species, Quann and Jaffe (235, 236) have developed a
method called Structure-Oriented Lumping (SOL) wherein individual hydro-
carbon molecules are represented as a vector of incremental structural
features. For example, the A6 group represents the six carbon aromatic ring
present in all aromatic molecules, while the A4 group represents a four
carbon aromatic ring increment attached to an A6 group to construct con-
densed multi-ring structures such as naphthalene. These groups can be con-
sidered as basis vectors and hence, each molecule within a mixture can be
represented by a structure vector in terms of this basis. Chemical reactions
can then be considered as vector transformations that map the structure
vector of the reactant to that of the product. Molecular thermodynamic proper-
ties can also be estimated by incorporating existing group contribution
methods within this formalism. The kinetics are based on the stoichiometry
and stability of the reactants and products, implying that the nature of the
solid acid catalyst was not accounted for in this study. This formalism allows
for composition-based modeling of refinery processes containing a very large
number of species (especially considering that a C20 n-paraffin generates 417
iso-paraffins and 6417 olefins). Subsequent work in this area has resulted in
extending SOL to develop an integrated model for the FCC process incorporat-
ing reaction chemistry, hydrodynamics and heat integration (237) as well as
developing detailed composition based models for predicting octane and
cetane numbers for various gasoline blends (238). Although this approach is
very advantageous for complex petroleum mixtures, for the light paraffin aro-
matization system typically such complexity is not encountered. Hence, most
modeling studies have incorporated the catalyst structure into the kinetics in
view of the simpler product distribution.
Researchers (184, 239247) have employed analysis of selectivity data to con-
struct reaction pathways for alkane cracking over solid acid catalysts. They have
categorized the observed product distribution into six categories: (1) stable
primary, (2) unstable primary, (3) stable primary plus secondary product, (4)
stable secondary, (5) unstable secondary, and (6) unstable primary plus second-
ary. For analysis purposes the authors have employed a number of terms.
1.
Optimum Performance Envelope (OPE): Plots of the time-average yields of
the various products versus total conversion of the reactant. The OPE
describes the behavior of the product as catalyst decay approaches zero.
A product is considered primary if the slope at the origin of such a curve

is non-zero and secondary if the slope is zero when extrapolated to zero
conversion.
2.
Reaction Path Probability (RPP): Procedure of solving the reaction system
matrix to obtain probabilities of various reaction pathways by selecting the
sum of initiation reactions as the objective function in a constrained
solution of the set of linear equations. Since the production of any
product in a complex series-parallel reaction network may involve
several operating elementary reactions, the above formalism appropriately
considers the initial molar selectivity of a product as the sum of contri-
butions from all operating reactions with the RPP of an elementary
reaction being defined as the fraction of total conversion which proceeds
via that one elementary reaction.

Bond Cleavage Probability (BCP): Comparison of the probabilities of
various C-H and C-C bond scissions. Hence, in equation form BCPi

Kinetic Chain Length (KCL): A ratio of the overall reaction rate to the
initiation rate.
Wojciechowski (248) has presented an excellent review of the above studies
and individually discussed the effects of acid strength, carbon number, and
volume expansion as well as provided a conceptual framework for including
elementary reactions and deactivation pathways in an attempt to quantitat-
ively describe catalytic cracking of hydrocarbons. The work of Zhao et al.
(243245, 247) has described the reactions of 2- and 3-methylpentane over
USY zeolite in terms of the following reactions.

As can be deduced from the above equations, each initiation and chain
propagation event produces one molecule of paraffinic product. Thus, the
total selectivity for paraffinic products must be at least one. On the other
hand, the sum of olefin selectivities could be less than or greater than one
since olefins appear in all termination reactions and b-scission cracking reac-
tions but no olefins are produced in chain propagation reactions.
The kinetics are interpreted in terms of five parameters: (i) a parameter
related to the sum of the rates of all initial reactions occurring via both mono-
molecular and chain processes, (ii) a parameter related to the initial rates of
bimolecular processes alone, (iii) a parameter which reflects the relative
values of adsorption constants of the reactants and products, and (iv) and (v)
related to modeling the deactivation behavior. For 2-methylpentane cracking
over HZSM-5 significant isomerization with little concurrent hydrogen pro-
duction was noted at 673 K while as temperature was increased the contri-
bution of unimolecular reactions was observed to increase. Upon dilution
with nitrogen, the contributions of bimolecular reactions as well as catalyst
decay were observed to decrease and the KCL was observed to decrease from
3.4 to 2.5. In general, hydrogen production was observed to increase upon
branching, and b-scission reactions were found to be of minor importance
in cracking of paraffins. For the cracking studies of n-nonane (242), the
coverage and composition of the catalyst was observed to change significantly
between 673 and 763 K due to a large difference in the enthalpy of adsorption
between the products and the reactant, however, the contributions from
unimolecular and bimolecular reactions could not be distinguished from the
kinetic data.
For all the above studies, the individual reaction rates were calculated by
taking the product of the RPP and the initial overall rate of consumption of
the reactant. Excellent agreement between experimental data and model pre-
dictions was observed, although only data for the consumption of the reactant
were generally presented. Even though these models allow for understanding
the initial selectivity behavior of the reactant alkane over USY zeolites, due
to the model structure, the individual contributions of the reactions cannot be
interpreted. Corma and coworkers (249, 250) have also reported conclusions
in agreement with Wojciechowski and coworkers for isobutane cracking investi-
gated over USYand cracking of C7, C10, C12, and C14 over USY, BEA, and ZSM-5
zeolites. The relative contribution of unimolecular pathways is observed to
increase with increasing temperature and decreasing pore dimensions.

Selectivity descriptors like olefin to paraffin ratio, linear to branched paraffin
and olefin ratios are considered to infer these effects, however, individual
reaction rates also remain inaccessible except for the initial alkane activation
reactions. Two formalisms stand out with regard to interpretation of elementary
reaction kinetics, and we discuss each of them below.
Investigators (251253) have developed the single-event concept and have
successfully employed this scheme to understand the kinetics of a number of
zeolite-catalyzed oil refining processes. Boolean relation matrices were used
by these researchers to generate the large number of reactions involved. For
octane hydroisomerization and hydrocracking (252) on a Pt-USY zeolite, the fol-
lowing elementary steps were considered: physisorption of feed components in
terms of the Langmuir isotherm, dehydrogenation of olefins over Pt sites,
olefin protonation on Brnsted acid sites yielding carbenium ions which isomer-
ize through hydride- and methyl-shifts and protanated-cylcopropane (PCP)
branchings, and b-scission reactions of these carbenium ions. Dehydrogenation
reactions occurring over metal sites were considered to be in equilibrium and
rate limiting steps were postulated to occur on the acid sites in these models.
Individual site balances for the Brnsted acid and Pt sites were written based
on the pseudo-state state and quasi-equilibrium assumptions. The number of
parameters was reduced by (i) disregarding primary carbenium ions, (ii)
employing thermodynamic constraints for reversible reactions, and (iii) consid-
ering rate coefficients to be independent of chain length for a given carbenium
ion species and only dependent on the nature (secondary or tertiary) of that
species. The single-event rate constant is related to the elementary step rate
coefficient as k0  ne k implying that the rate coefficient of an elementary step,
k0 is a multiple of that of a single event, k. The number of single events is rep-
resented by ne. The calculation of ne requires the configuration of the reactant
and the transition state to be determined, as it considers the chirality of each
of these configurations. It was assumed by the authors that the symmetry of
the alkoxide adsorbate and the carbenium-ion-like transition state is perturbed
to the same extent by interaction with the zeolite. We reproduce an example
from Martens and Frorrent (252) for illustration purposes. In Figure 11,
consider the methyl-shift from the 2-methyl-3 pentylcarbenium ion to the
3-methyl-2-pentylcarbenium ion for which in terms of elementary step
kinetics the rate coefficient would be written: kMS0 (s;s).

Intuitively, for the forward reaction from left to right, two methyl-groups
can shift, but only one for the reverse reaction from right to left. In other
words: a different value would be calculated for kMS0 (s;s) depending on
which isomer would be chosen for the experimental study. Hence, in addition
to the characterization of the type of the carbenium ion (18, 28, or 38), the struc-
tural multiplicity also needs to be accounted for.
Using replicate experimental data and hence a weighted least squares
objective function, parameter optimization for the octane hydrocracking
study was performed to obtain kinetic parameters. The values of the par-
ameters suggest the following chemistry:

2.
the cracking of tertiary carbenium ions to secondary carbenium ions on
acidic sites is rapid, while secondary to tertiary cracking is slow (kcrack(-
t;s)  0.88  1012 vs. kMS(s;t)  0.45  1006 in (mol/(gcath)).
The single event approach allows detailed kinetic models to be developed for
cracking on solid acid catalysts. These models are independent of the feedstock
composition and incorporate the basic features of carbocation chemistry. Each of
the studies above, however, focuses on modeling the behavior of the reactant.
For complex hydrocarbon systems, we believe that modeling efforts that also
obtain quantitative predictions for several other products may ensure unique-
ness of the parameters, as well as the model elementary reactions.
Dumesic and coworkers (254) have also employed similar quantitative
modeling concepts and have used the term microkinetic analysis for their meth-
odology. The idea behind microkinetic analysis is to describe, in terms of essen-
tial surface chemistry, the trends observed in all available data for existing
catalytic systems of relevance to the target catalytic process, as well as, to con-
solidate in a quantitative fashion available experimental data, theoretical prin-
ciples, and appropriate correlations relevant to the catalytic process. The
fundamental starting point in microkinetic analysis is to postulate elementary
reactions that capture the surface catalytic chemistry in terms of physical and
chemical parameters which can be measured independently or estimated by
means of theory. For an excellent review on microkinetic modeling that details
several case studies and identifies various assumptions involved in different
modeling methodologies, the reader is referred to a review by Stoltze (255).
Initial work from Yaluris et al. (256, 257) developed a kinetic model for iso-
butane cracking over Y zeolites. Carbenium ion species were considered as inter-
mediates and a parameter DH, the heat of stabilization of a carbenium ion
relative to the heat of stabilization of a proton in the zeolite framework, was

introduced to account for the different acidities of steamed and un-steamed
catalysts. Pre-exponential factors were obtained using transition state theory,
equilibrium constraints were used to obtain the reverse rate constant values
and catalytic correlations like the Polanyi relation were employed to obtain a
relatively simple 21-step-based predictive model for this system.
Sanchez-Castillo et al. (258, 259) and Agarwal et al. (260) have sub-
sequently refined the above model over USY, H-MOR, and H-BEA as well as
extended it to 2-methylhexane cracking. We focus our discussion on the
reaction schemes of isobutane conversion. Reaction studies for isobutane con-
version over USY were performed at a total pressure of one atmosphere for
temperatures of 523 and 573 K. The temperatures used in the earlier work
by Yaluris et al. (256, 257) were between 733 and 773 K, temperatures at
which the reactions were initiated by the activation of isobutane. On the
other hand the low temperature study by Sanchez-Castillo et al. (258)
required initiation by co-feeding 50 to 400 ppm of isobutylene. Unlike the
Yaluris et al. (256, 257) model, this model considers surface intermediates to
be alkoxy intermediates that react via carbocationic transition states, in line
with recent experimental and theoretical studies discussed in section 3.4.
The reaction scheme was developed based on the following reaction types:
adsorption/desorption,
oligomerization/b-scission,
isomerization,
hydride
transfer, and initiation steps. Restricting the carbon number of species partici-
pating in the reaction scheme to 12 resulted in a model containing 370 elemen-
tary reactions. The model was found to have 277 unknowns, including 186 gas
phase species, 90 surface species, and the fraction of vacant sites. Equilibrium
constraints
for
reversible
adsorption/desorption
and
oligomerization/
b-scission cycles, typical pre-exponential factors, equal reactivity of similar
alkoxide intermediate states, and Bensons group contribution methods (261)
as well as carbon number dependence for the enthalpy of formation of
surface species were employed to reduce the number of bounded parameters
to 11. The Athena Visual Workbench software was employed to obtain par-
ameter estimates and 95% confidence limits.
The results from the kinetic model gave similar activation energies of
156.5 kJ/mol and 154.3 kJ/mol for the two initiation mechanisms to form
isobutyl and propyl surface species, respectively. The activation energies for
the b-scission reaction were calculated to be 102.2 kJ/mol for 38 ! 38 and iden-
tical 115.1 kJ/mol for 28 ! 38 and 28 ! 28 reactions. The activation barrier for
hydride transfer reactions for C.5 was calculated to be 62.2 kJ/mol and based
on the site balance, the surface was found to be have approximately 99% or
greater vacant sites under reaction conditions, even at the lowest tempera-
tures. Kotrel et al. (127, 128, 262) have investigated the cracking of n-hexane
on HZSM-5, H-Y, and H-BEA zeolites and have also commented on the
acidity of these materials. The intrinsic activation barrier calculated for mono-
molecular cracking for n-hexane was calculated from data at low conversions

and found to be 161 kJ/mol which matches well with the values presented by
Dumesic and coworkers. These authors however, point out that only about
15% of the Brnsted acid sites in USY zeolite are catalytically active for this
reaction, whereas Dumesic and coworkers have considered every Brnsted
acid site as an active site. Babitz et al. (126) and Williams et al. (263) have
also investigated the monomolecular cracking of n-hexane over USY, MOR,
and ZSM-5 zeolites and report that apparent differences in activation
energies are due to the different heats of adsorption of n-hexane and, within
experimental error the intrinsic activation energy for n-hexane cracking is
230 kJ/mol, independent of the pore structure. The 11-parameter model
described by Sanchez-Castillo et al. (258) is observed to give good quantitative
fits to the data, however, the trends observed in the experimental data are not
always observed to be described by the model.
The above study also extends to determining the sensitivity of the kinetic
model to various steps in the reaction scheme. We do not discuss here
methods to determine the rate determining step in a reaction mechanism,
and the reader is referred to the following publications for additional details
(264268). Dumesic and coworkers have used the degree of rate control as
defined by Campbell (264) shown in Eq. (4) where the partial derivative is
taken holding constant the equilibrium constant for step i and the rate con-
stants kj for all other steps j.

The r refers to the overall rate of the reaction, in this case, the rate of con-
sumption of isobutane. The most sensitive steps were found to involve hydride
transfer of surface species with isobutane and oligomerization/b-scission steps
involving C7 and C8 species. Isobutane activation was found to be kinetically
significant only at high temperatures. Based on results from this sensitivity
analysis, the authors were able to define a simplified kinetic model that
included only 48 reaction steps. This simplified kinetic model employs par-
ameters determined from the extended kinetic model and is observed to give
results in general agreement with the full kinetic model.
In an additional study Sanchez-Castillo et al. (259) have extended the
study of isobutane conversion over USY zeolites, to describe isobutane reactiv-
ity over H-MOR and H-BEA zeolites. Under similar reaction conditions, the
kinetic model is again observed to give quantitative predictions, although all
the observed trends in the experimental data are not always emulated by the
model predictions. A tabulated comparison of the obtained kinetic parameters
over the three zeolite structures is shown in Table 1.
From the tabulated values in Table 1, it can be observed that the heat of
adsorption of alkenes is significantly higher on H-MOR and H-BEA zeolites.

This is also reflected in the much higher surface coverage, up to 52% and 63%
on H-MOR and H-BEA respectively, predicted by the kinetic model under the
same reaction conditions. Although the order of magnitude increase in iso-
butane initiation reactions matches up well with experimental studies from
Kotrel et al. (127), the intrinsic activation energies for n-hexane cracking
reported by Kotrel et al. (127) are 161 kJ/mol on USY and 157 kJ/mol on
H-BEA. The 30 kJ/mol difference in the heat of adsorption between USY and
H-MOR is similar to the value reported by Babitz et al. (126), however, the
intrinsic activation energies for n-hexane cracking reported in the latter
study are at least 60 kJ/mol higher than the values reported by Sanchez-
Castillo et al. (259) for isobutane cracking. The high paraffin/olefin ratio
observed over H-MOR and H-BEA was attributed by the authors to the lower
composite activation barrier for hydride transfer reactions in these materials.
This explanation however, is derived in the limit of low coverage, a scenario
which may not be applicable in this case. In general, it is observed that due
to the much higher heat of adsorption on H-MOR and H-BEA, the composite
activation barriers are lower for b-scission and hydride transfer reactions,
even though the intrinsic activation energies are higher.
The initial chain mechanism studies by Wojciechowski and coworkers
(239248) as well as the quantitative modeling ideas presented by Froment
and coworkers (251253) and Dumesic and coworkers (256260) have signifi-
cantly enhanced our mechanistic understanding of complicated hydrocarbon
systems on zeolites. Some of these methodologies have been adapted to study
alkane aromatization over HZSM-5 based materials and we describe these
studies below.
Watson et al. (269) have presented a modeling study for the cracking of
n-heptane on HZSM-5 using linear free energy relationships (LFER) for
various reaction families to determine kinetic parameters that would be inde-
pendent of feedstock. Within this formalism, each sterically similar reaction
family for example b-scission, hydride transfer, etc. is defined by a single

Arrhenius pre-exponential factor, and its LFER relates the change in acti-
vation energy to a reactivity index (RI). The reactivity index could be associated
with a molecular property of one of the reactants or products, or a property of
the reaction itself, such as the heat of reaction. To account for the influence of
the catalyst surface on the ionic surface species, a catalyst dependent DH par-
ameter was defined, identical to the approach taken by Yaluris et al. (256, 257).
Three different temperatures, 723, 773, and 823 K were studied for a Si/Al
ratio of 21.5 and three different silicon to aluminum ratio materials, 21.5,
35.25, and 63.5, were studied at a temperature of 773 K. The authors noted
an increase in catalytic activity when the Si/Al ratio decreased from 21. 5 to
35.25 and attribute this to enhanced acidity, however; this explanation contra-
dicts observations from several other experimental studies wherein no acidity
change is observed with Si/Al ratio, as discussed in Section 2.1. There was good
agreement between model predictions and experimental data is for n-heptane
cracking, even though this model does not incorporate any features dependent
on the primary, secondary or tertiary nature of the surface species or transition
states.
Lukyanov and coworkers (115, 270277) have led the way in developing
kinetic models for light paraffin and olefin aromatization on HZSM-5
materials. We focus our discussion on two publications (271, 274), the first
one discussing ethylene and propylene aromatization and the second one dis-
cussing propane aromatization, over HZSM-5 and Ga/HZSM-5 catalysts that
are particularly relevant.
Experimental data were generated at a hydrocarbon pressure of 1 bar, at a
temperature of 803 K on a HZSM-5 material with Si/Al  27 for olefin aromati-
zation (at 2-3 minutes on stream to avoid catalyst deactivation) and Si/Al  40
for propane aromatization. The gallium loading on these materials was 4 wt.%.
The reaction scheme proposed is comprised of 42 components: 9 olefins C2
C10
 ,
10 paraffins C1C10, hydrogen, 7 dienes D4D10, 5 alkylcyclohexenes X6X10, 5
alkylcyclohexadienes Y6Y10, and 5 alkylbenzenes A6A10, where the subscript
index denotes the number of carbon atoms in the component molecule. Individ-
ual H and Ga sites were considered and individual site balances written for
each site, however, it is not apparent whether each gallium site was considered
to compensate for an H site as will be evident from our discussion in Section
4.3. The following reaction steps were considered to occur on Brnsted acid
sites: protolytic cracking and dehydrogenation of C2C4 paraffins, hydride
transfer reactions of adsorbed olefins with propane, protonation of unsaturated
compounds, olefin oligomerization and b-scission, diene formation via hydrogen
transfer between two olefinic molecules, interaction of olefins with dienes to
form higher molecular weight dienes, diene cyclization, and formation of aro-
matics by successive hydrogen transfer reactions. The gallium sites were con-
sidered to participate in alkane activation by dehydrogenation to form
alkenes and hydrogenolysis to generate methane, adsorption/desorption of

unsaturated compounds, dehydrogenation of olefinic compounds to give dienes
and dehydrogenation of napthenic compounds to aromatics. To reduce the
number of reactions, isomers were not considered in this study.
For derivation of the rate equations, it was assumed that adsorption equili-
brium was established and that adsorption constants were independent of mol-
ecular weight. Based on our discussion of adsorption effects in Section 2.2., the
latter assumption appears not to be valid in this case. Carbon number depen-
dence was accounted for by considering various rate constants to be carbon
number dependent. Based on adsorption equilibrium, a relatively simple site
balance could be postulated and the kinetic model could be represented as a
set of 42 equations represented as shown in Eq. (5) where Ri is the rate of trans-
formation of the ith component; yis is the stoichiometric coefficient in the sth
reaction step; rs is the rate of the sth reaction step.

A plug flow reactor model was used and the Gear method was used for
numerical integration of the system of differential equations. Further
reduction of the number of parameters was obtained by considering that (i)
C4C10 olefins had similar reactivity except for the b-scission reaction, (ii) reac-
tions of cyclic olefins and diolefins for hydride transfer were independent of
carbon number and (iii) the rate of dehydrogenation steps were independent
of molecular weight over the gallium sites.
Data at short contact times (23 minutes-on-stream) were used to identify
the initial mechanisms of the light olefin aromatization reaction. Based on the
observed product distribution as a function of contact time, the authors were
able to discern an inhibitory effect of aromatics due to competitive adsorption
as well as postulate C-C bond cleavage on gallium sites based on the high
ethane production for propane aromatization reactions. The inhibitory effect
of aromatics however, was somewhat artificially accounted for by arbitrarily
increasing the adsorption constant for aromatics by a factor of 30 compared
to olefins with the same carbon number. Based on setting the gallium par-
ameters to be zero, the authors were also able to comment on the relative
importance of gallium sites for various mechanisms. Gallium sites were calcu-
lated to result in the formation of 90% of the dienes and 50% of the aromatic
molecules for propane aromatization. Olefin reactivity in hydrogen transfer
reactions was found to increase from ethene to butenes, with ethene being 11
times less reactive than butenes. For olefin aromatization, the authors find
that diene formation via hydrogen-transfer steps on Brnsted acid sites was
rate limiting, however, only relative rate constant values were presented in
this study. The authors account for the decrease in Si/Al ratio for the
propane aromatization study by multiplying each of the rate constants

obtained from the olefin aromatization study by the ratio of appropriate Si/Al
ratios. For propane transformation on HZSM-5, the rate constants for protoly-
tic activation of propane were calculated to be at least 1000 times slower than
the rate constants of diene cyclization stepsthe rate limiting step for olefin
aromatization. Based on the rate constant values presented for propane trans-
formation on HZSM-5 the cracking to dehydrogenation ratio on HZSM-5 was
noted to be 2.7. The introduction of gallium was observed to increase the dehy-
drogenation rate constant by a factor of 7, while the protolytic cracking rate
was not observed to be significantly altered. Both these observations are in
close agreement with the work of Kwak et al. (117). Good quantitative agree-
ment between model predictions and the experimental data are obtained
based on 30 rate constants for olefin aromatization and an additional 14 rate
constants for paraffin aromatization. A recent study from Nguyen et al. (278)
has extended these studies to butane aromatization and has highlighted the
much lower contribution of hydride transfer reactions in propane conversion
due to the slower activation of propane resulting in a lower steady state concen-
tration of olefins.
Although the above studies represent a valuable starting point for develop-
ing complex models for light alkane aromatization, we note that a majority of the
individual rate constants remain inaccessible from a quantitative point of view.
In addition, since the above studies were conducted at a single temperature,
activation energy values cannot be calculated and individual pre-exponential
factors cannot be checked for consistency based on transition state theory.
Since our philosophy for optimal catalyst formulation (279, 280) relies exten-
sively on the validity of the kinetic model and due to the concerns described
above, we have developed a detailed microkinetic model for propane aromatiza-
tion on HZSM-5 catalysts (214) that is briefly described below.
Our model considers surface species to be neutral alkoxides, reactions of
these alkoxides to occur via carbenium-ion-like transition states and alkane
activation via carbonium-ion-like transition states. The carbon number of
species was restricted to 9, as products larger than C9 are typically not
observed in the product distribution, and isomers were not considered in
this study in order to reduce the number of reactions. 311 reactions were
grouped into 37 reaction families and the number of unknown parameters
was reduced to 25 by using adsorption parameters for n-alkanes and relative
rates for b-scission (187) and hydride transfer (198200) from the literature.
The rates of 10 products were monitored over the following experimental con-
ditions: propane pressure of 1 atmosphere, temperatures in the range 793
823 K and contact time 012 g.-cat h./mol. Replicate data were used to
estimate the pure sum of squared errors for statistical analyses. The model
developed acknowledges the carbon number dependence of alkane adsorption
energetics, considers the existence of methoxy surface species, includes alky-
lation reactions as discussed in Section 3.1.4, as well as postulates the

elementary steps for cyclization and subsequent aromatization by hydride
abstraction reactions. We obtain a quantitative description of these data at
various conversions and obtain tight bounds on all the energetic parameters;
model predictions at 803 and 813 K are shown in Figure 12. The bounds for
the pre-exponential factors are, however, not tight and we attribute this to
lack of parametric detail within each reaction family. Similar to the work of
Dumesic and coworkers, we have also employed to degree of rate control as
a sensitivity measure, and find alkane activation to be rate limiting.
Although the Lack-of-fit test (281) suggests scope for model improvement,
the good agreement between experimental data and model predictions over
a wide range of space times and hence conversions suggests that we have
developed a microkinetic model that can describe the activity of Brnsted
acid sites in HZSM-5.
Corma et al. (282) have commented on the limitations of establishing the
contribution of unimolecular and bimolecular reaction pathways for cracking
reactions of long chain linear paraffins. They show that to determine the
reaction mechanism based on experimental selectivity, the reactions con-
sidered need to be independent. In the absence of an independent reaction
system, the application of conservation laws results in a linearly dependent
reaction system which generates several independent reaction schemes and
makes it impossible for the contribution of unimolecular and bimolecular reac-
tions to be discerned. We note the above argument might be circumvented, in
case of light paraffin cracking, as products like methane and hydrogen do not
undergo secondary reactions and hence, may enable a distinction between
unimolecular and bimolecular reactions. We also comment that the mathemat-
ical derivation presented does not include relative rate considerations available
from modern day computational studies, constraints available from collision
and transition state theory etc., which would help eliminate multiplicity in
models.
In summary, recent quantitative modeling studies of propane aromatiza-
tion in conjunction with computational studies detailing the various elemen-
tary step kinetics of this system have greatly enhanced our understanding of
this chemistry. Propane conversion over HZSM-5 results in the production
of significant quantities of methane and ethane. Ideally, the transformation
of light alkanes to aromatics would be accompanied by the generation of
hydrogen. Hence, a metallic component is typically added to enhance the dehy-
drogenation function of the catalyst, and we present a discussion of gallium-
modified HZSM-5 materials in Section 4.

evaluated to give the best performance. Gallium-containing ZSM-5 formu-
lations are industrially preferred mainly due to the high volatility of zinc,
and our discussion below describes the synthesis and catalytic function of
these Ga-based formulations.
The aromatization of liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) alkanes to aromatics
(mainly benzene, toluene, and xylenes, BTX) on Ga-modified ZSM-5 catalysts
is commercialized in the Cyclar process jointly developed by UOP and BP. A
large volume of literature starting from the 1980s has discussed the
workings of this catalyst, and we present a tabulated compilation that
describes the method of preparation, pretreatment conditions and the main
conclusions of this literature in Table 2. Specific aspects of catalyst prep-
aration, characterization, kinetic studies, and catalytic function of gallium-
species on these materials are discussed below.
4.1.
Catalyst Preparation
As presented in Table 2, most gallium modified formulations are prepared
by impregnating, refluxing, or by mechanical mixing of Ga2O3 and HZSM-5,
with subsequent thermal activation or reduction. Our discussion below
attempts to show that Ga3 cations, in the as-prepared catalysts, irrespective
of the preparation technique, are re-dispersed under the strongly reducing con-
ditions and high temperatures prevalent during aromatization resulting in the
active formulation of the catalyst.
Wet impregnation of HZSM-5 with gallium salt solutions (Gallium nitrate
in general) guarantees gallium deposition on the catalyst, nevertheless, most of
the gallium is found to be located on the outside of the zeolite crystals as evi-
denced by XPS and electron microscopy studies. In general polyvalent
cations in HZSM-5 zeolites are found to be located preferentially at the outer
surface of crystallites for Me3 cations and inside the zeolite structure for
Me2 cations. This difference is ascribed to both enhanced steric and electro-
static hindrances arising for hydrated trivalent cations. A study of zinc and
gallium containing ZSM-5 zeolites by Yakerson et al. (283) to determine the
state of added cations for ethane aromatization by employing pyridine-probe-
molecule IR studies as well as analytical electron microscopy techniques con-
firmed that Zn2 cations led to ion exchange and generated Lewis acid sites
while Ga3 cations did not show any significant ion exchange or Lewis
acidity upon deposition. Nowak et al. (284) also confirmed that exchanging tri-
valent cations into ZSM-5 was difficult due to the hydrophobicity of the
materials as well as the weak anionic field due to the separation of the Al
sites required for ion exchange.
Electron microscopy studies of catalysts prepared by incipient wetness
impregnation and wet impregnation by Joly et al. (285) revealed that gallium
was mainly located on the outer surface of the zeolite crystallites as thin

First, you need to sequentially extract any quotes in the literature that are most relevant to each question, and print them in numbered order, separated by newlines. Quotes should be relatively brief. Do not attempt to summarize or answer questions at this stage, but simply repeat exactly what the corresponding part of the literature says.

Please enclose the full list of quotes in <quotes></quotes> XML tags. If there are no relevant quotes, write "No relevant quotes" instead.

Then, answer the question, starting with "Answer:".  Do not include or reference quoted content verbatim in the answer. Don't say "According to Quote [1]" when answering. Do not write reference number of quotes after answer. Put your answer to the user inside <EnglishVersionAnswer></EnglishVersionAnswer> XML tags. Output formatted text, with line breaks for each question.Separate quotes and answers with a blank line. Provide the answers to all questions in English. After completing the English answers, translate all those answers into Chinese and provide the Chinese version inside <ChineseVersionAnswer></ChineseVersionAnswer> XML tags.

Thus, the format of your overall response should look like what's shown between the <example></example> tags.  Make sure to follow the formatting and spacing exactly.
