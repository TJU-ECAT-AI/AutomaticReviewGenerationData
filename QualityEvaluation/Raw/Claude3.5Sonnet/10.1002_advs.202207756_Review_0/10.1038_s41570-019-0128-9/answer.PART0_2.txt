The growing demand for propylene has led to the development of new production methods, particularly propane dehydrogenation (PDH). This process has gained attention as a way to address the "propylene gap" in the chemical industry. 

The understanding of Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts for PDH has evolved over time. Research has focused on the support effect in propane dehydrogenation, with studies examining how different supports influence the activity and selectivity of gallium oxide catalysts. There has been an ongoing debate about the nature of active Ga species in these catalysts.

Recent research findings have contributed to our current knowledge of these catalysts by investigating the role of carbon dioxide in the dehydrogenation process. Studies have explored oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propylene using CO2 as an oxidant, which offers potential advantages in terms of thermodynamics and catalyst stability.

Additionally, research has expanded to include other metal oxide catalysts, such as In2O3-Al2O3 mixed oxides, for propane dehydrogenation in the presence of CO2. These studies have provided insights into the influence of support materials and metal-support interactions on catalyst performance.

Overall, the field continues to evolve as researchers seek to develop more efficient and stable catalysts for propane dehydrogenation to meet the growing demand for propylene.

丙烯需求的增长推动了新生产方法的发展，特别是丙烷脱氢(PDH)。这一过程作为解决化工行业"丙烯缺口"的一种方式受到关注。

对Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂在PDH中的理解随时间不断发展。研究重点关注了丙烷脱氢中的载体效应，研究了不同载体如何影响氧化镓催化剂的活性和选择性。关于这些催化剂中活性Ga物种的本质，一直存在争论。

近期研究成果通过研究二氧化碳在脱氢过程中的作用，为我们对这些催化剂的认知做出了贡献。研究探索了使用CO2作为氧化剂进行丙烷氧化脱氢制丙烯，这在热力学和催化剂稳定性方面提供了潜在优势。

此外，研究已扩展到包括其他金属氧化物催化剂，如In2O3-Al2O3混合氧化物，用于CO2存在下的丙烷脱氢。这些研究为载体材料和金属-载体相互作用对催化剂性能的影响提供了见解。

总的来说，随着研究人员寻求开发更高效、更稳定的丙烷脱氢催化剂以满足不断增长的丙烯需求，该领域继续发展。
