Shale gas is an abundant and accessible resource, each 
component of which may be utilized directly or serve 
as a precursor to value-
added chemicals and fuels. 
Depending on the source of shale gas, up to 15% v/v of 
the mixture can comprise C2H6, C3H8 and C4H10, with 
C2H6 being the most abundant1. Unlike CH4 (ref.2), these 
light alkanes contain CC bonds that can be dehydrogen-
ated to produce C2H4, C3H6 and C4H8 isomers (denoted 
C2
=, C3
= and C4
=, respectively), as well as 1,3-butadiene. 
The demand for these alkenes is high because they are 
important petrochemical building blocks. However, the 
conventional routes to produce the alkenes  thermal 
 
steam cracking and direct dehydrogenation (DD) 
 require high operating temperatures and often 
suffer from severe catalyst coking problems due to over-
oxidation and cracking3,4. Alternatively, light alkenes 
can be catalytically produced from non-
petroleum 
resources, such as coal and natural gas. However, the 
 
methanol-
to-olefins (MTO)5 and methanol-
to-propylene 
 
(MTP) processes6 can produce 610 tonnes of CO2 per 
tonne of olefin7, while the modified FischerTropsch 
synthesis8 is capital-
intensive. This motivates the search 
for alternative routes to alkenes, which brings us to reac-
tions in which CO2 effects oxidative dehydrogenation 
(CO2-ODH) of light alkanes  approaches that involve 
CO2 reduction to CO in tandem with alkane dehydro-
genation to the corresponding alkene (or diene). This 
tandem process requires a bifunctional catalyst to split 
the two very different reactants. Given access to suitable 
catalysts and reactors, we would have the opportunity 
to efficiently utilize the C2C4 components in shale gas 
while also lowering the concentration of a greenhouse 
gas. If the total C2H4, C3H6, C4H8 and 1,3-butadiene 
demand (7.77×1012molyr1)9 were to be satisfied with 
the CO2-ODH, assuming that each mole of alkene pro-
duced requires a mole of CO2, the process would con-
sume 14.6% of global chemical industry emissions10. 
More specifically, if we were to source our C2H4 from 
the CO2-ODH of C2H6, the reaction would offset 9.8% 
of total global chemical industry CO2 emissions per year 
and would consume only 0.026% of total global natu-
ral gas reserves11, assuming that their C2H6 content is at 
least1% v/v1.
In the CO2-ODH reaction, CO2 is a mild oxidant 
that is not prone to over-
oxidizing substrates and does 
not form an explosive reactive mixture (unlike O2 in 
the O2-ODH). Relative to direct dehydrogenation, the 
introduction of CO2 alters the pathway by providing an 
O atom that combines with the H atoms from the alkane 
to give H2O, consequently lowering ΔG for the reaction 
and making the reaction feasible at a lower operating 
temperature. One must also consider that CO2 can mod-
ify the surface and/or bulk composition of a catalyst, 
and these changes in redox, adsorption and electronic 
properties can influence activity and selectivity12,13.
The CO2-ODH reaction requires a bifunctional cat-
alyst that dissociates CO2 into CO and a reactive oxygen 
species *O (the asterisk notation denotes a surface-
bound 
moiety)12,14. The resulting *O would effect dehydrogena-
tion of the adsorbed alkane and give the corresponding 
alkene and H2O. The best catalysts are oxides of reducible 
metal ions  metal centres that readily donate abundant

Abstract  A greenhouse gas and mild oxidant, CO2 can effect the oxidative dehydrogenation 
(CO2-ODH) of light alkanes over heterogeneous catalysts. These catalysts are bifunctional in that 
they mediate CO2 reduction while oxidizing the alkanes, most notably the C2C4 components in 
shale gas. In this way
, one obtains CO and alkenes as value-
added products. Although desirable, 
this transformation has proven challenging in terms of catalyst design, with most catalysts for the 
CO2-ODH being metal oxides that typically undergo rapid deactivation. More recently
, bimetallic 
catalysts have been identified as promising systems to activate alkanes by either selectively 
cleaving CH bonds to produce alkenes or breaking all the CC and CH bonds to produce the 
dry reforming products CO and H2. This Review describes general trends in the CO2-ODH of light 
alkanes. We will also outline how to use a combined approach involving flow reactor experiments, 
in operando characterization and density functional theory to determine whether a catalyst is 
intrinsically active for CO2-ODH or dry reforming.

lattice O atoms to allow efficient turnover 15. For example, 
 CO2-ODH reactions over Cr oxides have high initial 
conversion and selectivity because Criii centres can read-
ily convert into active Crvi forms. However, the Cr oxides 
have short life cycles, which, in conjunction with their 
toxicity, preclude commercial implementation. In con-
trast to oxides of Cr, those of Ga always have the metal 
in the +iii oxidation state, and non-
reducible catalysts 
such as Ga2O3 on an inert support such as MxOy (M=Ti, 
Zr, Al, Si, Mg) are proposed to operate by a two-
step oxi-
dative dehydrogenation mechanism, in which the cata
lyst first dehydrogenates the alkane to the alkene and 
H2, after which the H2 combines with CO2 in the reverse 
water gas shift (RWGS) reaction (CO2+H2CO+H2O). 
The Ga2O3/MxOy catalysts are effective for CO2 acti-
vation but bind alkanes at acidic sites that can induce 
cracking16  CC cleavage reactions that lead to coke 
formation and catalyst deactivation17. These results high-
light how we presently lack active and stable bifunctional 
 
CO2-ODH catalysts.
A variety of transition-
metal compounds have been 
investigated for their activity in the CO2-ODH of light 
alkanes. For example, trends in the activity of Cr2O3, 
MnO2, Fe2O3 and Mo2C catalysts on redox-
inactive oxide 
supports have been reported, but only exsitu catalyst 
characterization data exist and there is little detailed 
information regarding the active sites and mechanisms18. 
Some reviews summarizing the ODH of light alkanes 
describe the reaction with O2 as the oxidant and only 
briefly mention the possibility of using CO2 as a mild 
oxidant1922. Other prominent reviews concerning ODH 
focus on the catalyst properties required for CO2 activa-
tion and place less emphasis on describing the catalysts 
(typically Cr oxides) used for CO2-ODH reactions of 
C2H6, C3H8 and C4H10 (refs12,23). In the case of CO2-ODH 
of C3H8 over zeolites and Cr, V, Ga and In oxides, the 
high temperatures at which alkane conversion is thermo
dynamically favoured also favour CC scission over 
 
CH scission, thereby substantially lowering selectivity 
for the desired alkene24,25. Thus, an important charac-
teristic of a CO2-ODH catalyst is that it must selectively 
break CH bonds while preserving CC bonds in order 
to avoid CO2 oxidative dry reforming (DR), whereby 
CO2 and the alkane are converted into CO and H2.
This Review focuses on how to improve a catalysts 
selectivity for CH scission over CC scission path-
ways. We limit our scope to stable bimetallic and metal-
modified carbide catalysts, and provide an atomistic 
description of these examples in terms of the active sites 
for the CO2-ODH of light alkanes. Our emphasis is on 
the importance of combining catalytic measurements, 
insitu (often referred to as in operando or simply oper-
ando) characterization and density functional theory 
(DFT) calculations to identify reaction mechanisms 
and key descriptors that can be used to rationally design 
improved CO2-ODH catalysts.
Thermodynamic analysis
We conducted thermodynamics analyses of the CO2-ODH 
 
of alkanes, assuming atmospheric pressure feeds and 
allowing the temperature to vary (HSC Chemistry 
Outotec v8 software, which utilizes a Gibbs free-
energy-minimization algorithm). We considered both 
 
the one-
step mechanism CnH2n+2+CO2CnH2n+CO+
H2O (n=24) and a two-
step mechanism involving DD 
CnH2n+2CnH2n+H2, followed by the RWGS reaction. 
What becomes obvious is that, as mentioned above, 
acceptorless DD affords lower equilibrium alkene yields 
than the case in which CO2 is the H2 acceptor (Fig.1a 
illustrates this in the case of C2H6). Other thermo
dynamics studies indicate that alkanes undergo a two-
 
step pathway in the presence of CO2, with higher equilibr
ium conversions than when they are in an inert gas. 
 
These conversions are higher than those for the one-
step 
CO2-ODH pathway18,26. The Gibbs free-
energy changes 
of the CO2-ODH reactions of alkanes become more neg-
ative with higher alkanes (i-
C4>C3>n-
C4>C2), perhaps 
reflecting the favourability of forming more substituted

alkenes24. Our thermodynamics analyses afforded plots 
of ΔG versus T, where T is temperature, for CO2-ODHE, 
dry reforming (DRE, E signifies ethane) and direct 
dehydro
genation (DDE) of C2H6, as well as the RWGS 
 
reaction, the reverse Boudouard reaction and the 
 
CO2-ODH of C3H8 and C4H10 (Fig.1b).
Decomposition or cracking reactions can occur at the 
temperatures at which the CO2-ODH reaction proceeds. 
However, CO2 can consume the resulting coke through 
a comproportionation known as the reverse Boudouard 
reaction (CO2+C2CO). High reaction temperatures 
favour DRE because it affords several molar equivalents 
of CO and H2, such that the ΔS for formation of the syn-
thesis gas is large and positive. Equilibrium calculations 
have demonstrated that the yield of alkene and the com-
position of synthesis gas can be varied by altering the 
reaction temperature and CO2:alkane ratio27.
CO2-ODH of light alkanes over oxide catalysts
The most prevalent catalysts for CO2-ODH of light 
alkanes are oxides3,24,28 of Cr (refs2931), V (refs3234), 
Ga(refs35,36) and, to a lesser extent, In (refs37,38) and Co 
(refs3941). The catalytic activity of transition-
metal oxides 
is typically attributed to their redox activity, which is nec-
essary to effect O atom transfers. Less well-
examined cat-
alysts include Ca-
doped ThO2 (ref.42) and CaO doped 
into nanostructured CeO2 (ref.43). The support for the 
catalytically active oxide usually takes the form of a high-
surface-area mixed oxide4446, mesoporous SiO2 (ref.47) or 
a zeolite48. A catalytically active, reducible, high-
valent 
metal oxide can readily donate an O atom to serve as 
a H2 acceptor for the alkane. To complete this redox-
type Marsvan Krevelen mechanism, the metal centre 
undergoes oxidation by CO2 to fill the lattice O vacancy49 
(Fig.2a). The support can influence the acidbase proper-
ties and the distribution of reactive metal-
oxide groups 
on the catalyst surface, and is, thus, not to be neglected 
because it can shift catalytic activity50,51.
Cr oxide catalysts. Cr oxide catalysts for the CO2-ODH 
can give high C2H6 conversions even after short reac-
tion times, but the selectivity for CO2 conversion is low 
and the catalysts have short life cycles because they are 
unstable towards coking52. Cr oxides exhibit their high-
est activity and selectivity when supported by materials 
such as SiO2, siliceous MCM-41 and H-
ZSM-5 with high 
SiO2 content27,53. Although Cr oxides can be incorpo-
rated into mesoporous structures to afford more active 
species, much of the Cr in these materials exists as inac-
tive polychromates and the materials thus show greater 
selectivity for undesired products54. The oxidation 
state of Cr in a CrOx catalyst for the CO2-ODH of C2H6 
depends on whether the catalyst is supported onAl2O3, 
ZrO2, CeO2 or CexZr1xO2 (ref.46). The CrOx/γ-
Al2O3 
and CrOx/ZrO2 composites exhibit the highest ODHE 
activities but operate through different pathways. Thus, 
CrOx/γ-
Al2O3 primarily works by the two-
step DDE 
and RWGS mechanism, and can undergo deactiva-
tion if cracking affords substantial coke. By contrast, 
 
CrOx/ZrO2 performs CO2-ODH in a single step (albeit 
in competition with DR) and its mode of deactivation 
involves sintering or conversion into inactive Cr spe-
cies. Instead, when CrOx is on CeO2, it is less active 
but more stable because the reverse Boudouard reac-
tion can readily consume coke deposits. Studies on the 
CO2-ODHP (P signifies propane) reaction at 873K 
concluded that CrOx/SiO2 would exhibit increased 
activity and C3H6 selectivity with increasing CO2 partial 
pressure, whereas the activity of CrOx/γ-
Al2O3 would 
decrease with even a slight increase in the CO2 partial 
pressure27,50,53. The different performance between these 
two supports was attributed to two factors: CO2 adsorbs 
more strongly on γ-
Al2O3 (thereby competing with C3H8 
 
adsorption) and/or CO2 affects the acidbase properties 
of CrOx/γ-
Al2O3.
The activation of CO2 over CrOx dispersed in MCM-41 
 
has been attributed to isolated Crvi centres generated 
from Criii in a redox cycle5559 (Fig.2b). Increasing the Cr 
content to 8wt% affords the greatest Crvi:Criii ratios and 
increased alkane conversion60,61. Further increasing the 
Cr content of supported catalysts affords uneven distri-
butions of larger particles, which tend to agglomerate 
into α-
Cr2O3 and increase the concentration of inactive 
polychromate species3,49,56,58,62. Crvi=O species dehydro-
genate alkanes to the respective alkene more quickly 
than the resulting Criii species undergo reoxidation by 
abstracting O from CO2 (ref.30). Thus, even highly dis-
persed CrOx catalysts with an appropriate Cr loading 
undergo deactivation because their Criii sites are rela-
tively inactive and the materials eventually experience 
coking58. For instance, CrOx/MCM-41 nanocatalysts 
for the CO2-ODH of C2H6 at 823K show high initial 
selectivity for C2H4 (90%) but low maximum conver-
sion of C2H6 (<8%)61. After 12h on stream, the catalyst 
was deactivated and only maintained 30% selectivity 
towards the alkene. Doping the catalyst with Fe, Co or 
Mn improved C2H4 selectivity because the presence of 
the metals increases the concentration of weakly acidic 
sites that facilitate C2H6 activation. Moreover, doping 
leads to a decrease in the number of strong acid sites 
that mediate reforming and cracking63. The low conver-
sion exhibited by CrOx/SiO2 in CO2-ODH catalysis can 
be improved by doping in Ni, an element that has strong 
chemisorption of CO2 (ref.64). Despite these advances, Cr 
catalysts remain only rarely implemented owing to their 
short life cycles, as well as the high toxicity of Criii neces-
sitating meticulous care during the preparation, use and 
disposal of the materials.

V oxide catalysts. As with Cr oxide catalysts for CO2-ODH, 
 
the activity of V derivatives also depends on the nature 
of the supports due to the latters effects on reducibility, 
acidbase properties and dispersion24,65. Supported VOx 
catalysts are more selective than bulk V2O5 becauseVOx
support interactions can stabilize particularly active 
VOx surface structures. DFT calculations and isotopic 
labelling experiments on the CO2-ODH of alkanes over 
(supported or unsupported) V-
based catalysts indicate 
that both a one-
step oxidative dehydrogenation path-
way or a two-
step pathway with the RWGS reaction are 
possible66,67. Because the majority of V-
based catalysts 
operate through a Marsvan Krevelen mechanism68, 
a greater participation of O atoms from the support 
improves alkene selectivity, as observed for V2O5/CeO2
ZrO2 in the CO2-ODH of C4H10 (ref.69). The inclusion of 
CeO2 as part of the support increases O mobility and 
vacancy concentration relative to pure ZrO2, while also 
affording some CeVO4. In general, mixed-
oxide sup-
ports have improved activity relative to single oxides 
due to greater acidbase bifunctionality70. If the supports 
are only acidic, then they can only interact weakly with 
V2O5, such that this oxide forms poorly dispersed crys-
tallites12. Indeed, polymeric V species led to low alkene 
yield, again indicating that dispersion is a key factor in 
controlling selectivity7173. A DFT study on the plausi-
ble VOx species (monomeric, dimeric, polymeric, com-
pared with bulk) present on the support revealed that 
the optimal size of V2O5 differed when SiO2 or CeO2 was 
chosen as the support. Inaddition, although there is no 
energetic preference for larger or smaller species, there 
is a kinetic preference for dimers because they can per-
form the rate-
determining H-
abstraction step faster than 
the other species can74. Thus, taking these observations 
into account, it has been shown that V2O5 dispersed in 
mesoporous SiO2 nanospheres can exhibit 90% propyl-
ene selectivity during 8-h cycles, with the conversion 
decreasing from 60% to 20 % within one cycle75. This 
catalytic performance was maintained only for eight 
reactionregeneration cycles (64h on stream). Overall, 
progress on developing V2O5 catalysts is promising, but 
the presence of acidic sites that promote the cracking of 
alkenes remains a challenge, and there are also health 
concerns regarding V2O5 dust.
In and Ga oxides. The metal centres in In oxides can 
undergo reduction (Iniii to In0) but cannot be reoxidized 
by CO2 under typical reaction conditions, such that 
these catalysts operate through a two-
step CO2-ODH 
pathway37,38,76. Among In2O3/MOx bimetallic, mixed-
oxide catalysts (M=Al, Zn, Zr, Ti, Fe, Mg, Si and Ce)77, 
In2O3/CeO2 has the lowest CO2-ODH activity77, 
despite its reported utility in catalysing the RWGS 
reaction when synthesized as a In2O3CeO2 mixture78. 
By contrast, In2O3/Al2O3 affords the highest yield of 
 
C3H6 and exhibits good stability because In2O3 is highly 
dispersed and the material has a balance between acid 
and base properties. In a separate study, fresh and unre-
duced In2O3/Al2O3 undergoes induction over 3h, dur-
ing which it increases in activity as the concentration of 
In0 sites increases, as evidenced by X-
ray photoelectron 
spectroscopy and temperature-
programmed reduction 
(TPR) studies38. Catalytic activity and TPR data suggest 
that the initial generation and stabilization of optimal 
surface concentrations of In0 species are crucial for activ-
ity. Consistent with these findings, the prereduced cata-
lyst did not require an induction period and had similar 
C3H6 selectivity and only slightly less conversion than the 
fresh catalyst sample38. Moreover, as with Cr and V oxide 
catalysts, the support plays a crucial role by affecting the 
dispersion of In2O3 and acidbase properties.
Ga oxide catalysts for the CO2-ODH differ from 
those described above because the former are typi-
cally not redox-
active over the relevant potential range 
and the catalysts operate through heterolytic dissoci-
ation of the alkane and activation of CO2 (refs49,79,80). 
Unsupported Ga2O3 has a high initial C3H6 selectivity 
(30%) but, after 10min, the selectivity decreases to 
less than 10% because coke formation deactivates the 
material81. Among a series of Ga2O3 catalysts supported 
on TiO2, ZrO2, γ-
Al2O3, SiO2 or MgO, only Ga2O3/TiO2 
exhibits an enhancement in activity and selectivity for 
alkene production in the presence of CO2, which can 
readily remove chemisorbed H atoms on the catalyst 
surface through the RWGS reaction16. The lower activity 
of Ga2O3/ZrO2 and Ga2O3/Al2O3 in particular was attrib-
uted to CO2 competing with the alkane for Ga binding, 
such that the alkane is displaced to basic catalyst sites. 
 
In general, when Ga2O3 is on a support and exposed to 
CO2, it binds C3H8 too weakly to rapidly effect its con-
versions. The competitive binding is not observed for 
Ga2O3/TiO2 under low partial pressures of CO2 but is 
dominant at all pressures when Al2O3 or ZrO2 are used as 
supports. Thus, the role of CO2 over Ga-
based catalysts 
is largely dependent on the support. So, we can say that 
Ga oxides outperform Cr and V oxides, but the unsup-
ported materials still exhibit low stability and 
tolerance 
to coking and the supported materials bind CO2 too 
strongly relative to alkanes.
CO2-ODH over bimetallic and carbide catalysts
The electronic and catalytic properties of a transi-
tion metal can be modified by alloying it with C or 
anothermetal. The resulting metal carbides82 or bime-
tallic alloys83 are often quite distinct from their parent 
metals, presenting an opportunity to design new cata-
lysts with enhanced CO2-ODH selectivity and stability84. 
Bimetallic catalysts are typically supported on high-
surface-area metal oxides. For example, CO2 hydro-
genation85 proceeds rapidly over bimetallics supported 
by CeO2 because it is a reducible support that can release 
 
O atoms and then recover them86 by inducing direct C=O 
scission87. The abundance of reactive lattice O atoms 
 
protects the material because any coke deposits that form 
can be readily removed by oxidation88,89. Thus, support-
ing catalysts on CeO2 should promote the activation of 
CO2, while the choice of the bimetallic should influence 
selectivity43,90,91. The conversion of C2H6 has been inves-
tigated over CeO2-supported bimetallic catalysts Co3Pt1, 
Co3Mo1, Ni3Mo1 and Fe3Ni1 (note that, throughout this 
Review, the formulae denote element ratios and do not 
 
describe small clusters of metals). Experiments were 
conducted at 823K, a temperature at which both 
CO2-ODH and the competing DR may occur. In this

way, it was possible to identify the systems that selectively 
 
break CH bonds of C2H6 to produce C2H4, and the 
less desirable systems that break CC bonds to produce 
CO as the only carbonaceous product92. Flow reactions 
over Fe3Ni1/CeO2 afforded C2H4 by means of selective 
CH cleavage. The supported bimetallic catalyst is more 
stable than the supported monometallics Fe/CeO2 and 
 
Ni/CeO2, motivating investigations into how FexNiy 
active sites bind CO2 and C2H6, and favour CH scission 
to afford high C2H4 selectivity93.
CO2-ODH of C2H6 over FexNiy/CeO2 catalysts
In the following sections, we use the CO2-ODH of C2H6 
over FexNiy/CeO2 catalysts as a case study to illustrate the 
importance of combining catalytic measurements with 
insitu characterization and DFT calculations. This will 
be supplemented with discussion of CO2-ODH of other 
light alkanes over bimetallic and carbide catalysts.
Flow reactor evaluation of activity and selectivity. The 
flow reactor results for the conversion of C2H6 and CO2 
over FexNiy/CeO2 indicate that Fe3Ni1/CeO2 has the high-
est C2H4 selectivity (>75%), while Fe1Ni3/CeO2 has the 
highest yield of CO (with CO selectivity >98%) by means 
of DR (Fig.3a). The selectivities were almost unchanged 
at comparable C2H6 conversions (Fig.3b), suggesting that 
the difference comes from intrinsic kinetics. By consid-
ering how C2H4 selectivity changes with C2H6 conver-
sion over Fe3Ni1/CeO2 (Fig.3c), we see that C2H4 is the 
primary reaction product and surmise that Fe3Ni1/CeO2 
is a promising CO2-ODH catalyst. Notably, Ni/CeO2 is 
an excellent reforming catalyst, while Fe/CeO2 is a poor 
catalyst for both reactions. So, the high selectivity that 
Fe3Ni1/CeO2 shows for the CO2-ODH can be inferred 
to arise from distinct active sites in which Fe interacts 
with Ni (Fig.3d).
Insitu and exsitu characterization of active sites. The 
structural properties of Fe3Ni1/CeO2 and Fe1Ni3/CeO2 
are evident from insitu synchrotron X-
ray diffraction 
(XRD) patterns93, while the oxidation state of Ni and 
Fe come from insitu X-
ray absorption near edge struc-
ture (XANES) data93. In both catalysts, Ni exists as Ni0 
(Fig.4a), while Fe sites exhibit near edge features between 
those of FeO and Fe3O4 (closer to Fe3O4; Fig.4b). Detailed

exist as thin layers on CeO2, which can be corroborated 
using exsitu annular dark-
field scanning transmission 
electron microscopy (ADF-
STEM) with electron energy 
loss spectroscopy (EELS)93. The high-
resolution micro-
graphs indicated that the CeO2 particles in Fe3Ni1/CeO2 
(Fig.5a,b) differ from those in Fe1Ni3/CeO2 (Fig.5c,d), 
because the former catalyst has CeO2 in contact with a 
thin layer of FeOx (Fig.5e), as also evidenced by EELS line 
scan profiles (Fig.5f).
The above characterization data allow the active sites 
for CO2-ODH and DR to be deduced93. In Ni/CeO2 cat-
alysts, CeO2 helps enable facile CO2 dissociation to give 
a *O species that participates in C2H6 activation on the 
Ni particles at the NiCeO2 interfaces. When a small 
amount of Fe was added, the resulting Fe1Ni3/CeO2 mate-
rials feature NiCeOx interfacial sites that process C2H6 
and CO2 faster than other sites, and allow the catalyst 
to maintain high CO selectivity (>95%). The NiCeOx  
interfaces were thus identified as the most likely active 
sites for DR of C2H6 with CO2 over Fe1Ni3/CeO2 (Fig.6). 
When a large amount of Fe was introduced, a material 
of formula Fe3Ni1/CeO2 resulted, which has amor-
phous FeOx regions that extend far enough to form 
 
NiFeOx interfacial sites on the perimeter of Ni particles 
(these probably form at the expense of NiCeOx sites). 
Itappears likely that the NiFeOx interfaces are respon-
sible for the high activity of Fe1Ni3/CeO2 for CO2-ODH 
of C2H6.
DFT calculations of reactions on FeNi surfaces. The 
insitu measurements give us an idea of the possible FeNi 
structures responsible for catalytic activity. These can-
didate structures can be studied using DFT calculations 
to investigate possible reaction pathways for the oxida-
tive CH bond cleavage (dehydrogenation; Fig.7) and 
CC bond scission (reforming). The calculated enthalpy 
changes suggest that the first step along the CH bond 
cleavage pathway is thermodynamically more favourable 
than the CC bond cleavage pathway on FeOx/Ni(111). 
 
Comparing the activation energy (Ea) for each pro-
cess, the *O-
mediated scission of the first CH bond 
in C2H6 is likely the most difficult step in the oxidative 
CH and CC cleavage of C2H6. On Ni(111), *O inser-
tion (*C2H5+*O*OC2H5+*, where the latter asterisk 
denotes a free surface site) is part of the CC cleavage 
pathway (E=0.14eV and Ea=0.44eV) and is ther-
modynamically and kinetically more favourable than 
oxidative dehydrogenation (*C2H5+*O*C2H4+*OH) 
along the CH cleavage pathway (E=0.09eV and 
Ea=0.97eV). On Ni-
terminated Ni3Fe(111), *O inser-
tion to form *OC2H5 should occur at a comparable 
rate to oxidative dehydrogenation to give *C2H4. On 
bulk-
terminated Ni3Fe(111), the activation energy of 
oxidative dehydrogenation is 0.16eV lower than that for 
 
*O insertion. As a result, bulk-
terminated Ni3Fe(111) 
likely promotes CH cleavage in preference to CC 
cleavage, suggesting that the presence of surface Fe sites is 
essential for selective CH cleavage and C2H4 formation. 
Furthermore, the DFT calculations on FeOx/Ni(111) 
show that oxidative dehydrogenation (E=0.13eV 
and Ea=1.08eV) is more favourable than *O insertion 
(E=0.04eV and Ea=1.67eV). Thus, in agreement 
with the experimental results, the DFT calculations 
predict that the NiFeOx interface should be active 
for the dehydrogenation of C2H6, leading to the high 
 
CO2-ODH selectivity93.
CO2-ODH of C2H6 over carbide-
based catalysts. Metal 
carbides such as Mo2C are highly attractive catalysts for 
CO2-ODH reactions because they are active for CO2 and 
alkane activation and have redox properties similar to 
those of reducible oxides9498. For example, Mo2C and 
Mo2C/γ-
Al2O3 showed enhanced selectivity towards 
C2H4 production through the CO2-ODH pathway99. 
The DFT-
calculated energy profiles of oxidative dehy-
drogenation and reforming of C2H6 over Mo2C(001) 
illustrated that oxidative CH cleavage to give *C2H4 and 
H2 is energetically more favourable than CC scission to 
form reforming products. The calculations indicate that 
Mo2C(001) has a very high affinity to adsorb atomic O. 
Flow reactor experiments were consistent with these pre-
dictions, and the Mo2C catalyst showed a C2H4 selectivity 
of 60%. These experiments also highlighted the different 
activities of unsupported and supported Mo2C. Mo2C 
supported on CeO2 showed lower activity than unsup-
ported Mo2C, but the latter has slightly higher activity 
when supported on γ-
Al2O3, a more acidic oxide. The 
low steady-
state activity of Mo2C/CeO2 was attributed to 
the high initial intrinsic activity of CeO2 and Mo2C for 
C=O bond scission, resulting in an excess of *O on the 
surface that deactivates Mo2C/CeO2 through complete 
oxidation. The Mo2C/γ-
Al2O3 catalyst also suffers from 
deactivation because it binds the *C2H4 product strongly, 
such that C2H4 undergoes decomposition and/or poly
merization to form coke. Insitu XANES measurements 
showed that, although CO2 is necessary to form an oxy-
carbide phase that dehydrogenates C2H6, excessive CO2 
can lead to complete deactivation. Catalyst regeneration 
is possible by co-
feeding H2 (5vol%) with the reactants

or by exposing the catalyst to H2 after the reaction. 
Lastly, we note that the selectivity and stability of Mo2C 
catalysts for CO2-ODH of C2H6 can be enhanced by par-
tial oxidation of Mo2C, which affords a material that is 
slower at CC cleavage of C2H6 and better at producing 
C2H4 (ref.100). Furthermore, the introduction of Fe accel-
erated the formation of *O, which increases C2H4 yield 
and improves catalyst stability.
CO2-ODH of C3H8 and C4H10. Just as experimental and 
DFT approaches were applied to reactions of CO2+C2H6, 
a similar treatment can be done for CO2+C3H8 at 
823K. The catalysts examined included bimetallic 
systems comprising a precious metal (Pt or Pd) and a 
non-
precious metal (Fe, Co or Ni), and combinations 
of non-
precious metals, all supported on CeO2 (ref.101). 
The results of steady-
state flow reactions identified 
Fe3Ni1/CeO2 and Ni3Pt1/CeO2 as promising catalysts for 
CO2-ODH and DRP of C3H8, respectively102 (Fig.8). The 
average metal particle sizes of the Ni3Pt/CeO2 (2.3-nm 
 
particles, from TEM) and Fe3Ni1/CeO2 (<2-nm parti-
cles, from insitu XRD) systems are small. Fe3Ni1/CeO2 
exhibits 58% C3H6 selectivity with good stability, while 
Ni3Pt/CeO2 is a highly active DRP catalyst with 96% 
selectivity for CO. Additionally, the amount of CO pro-
duced by Fe3Ni1 exceeds that expected from C3H6+H2O 
(as a result of one-
step CO2-ODH and subtracting con-
tributions from the RWGS reaction), indicating that 
some CO comes from the reverse Boudouard reaction 
 
and/or over-
oxidation of alkenes or lighter components. 
Unlike oxidations with O2, which produce CO2 due to 
over-oxidation, the CO2-ODH reaction results in a net 
reduction of CO2 because CO2 is consumed instead of 
being produced. Plotting CO2 conversion against CO 
selectivity for Fe3Ni1 and Ni3Pt1 can also clarify the 
intrinsic activity of the catalysts for CO2-ODHP or DRP. 
In the case of Ni3Pt1, the high value of the y-
intercept of 
CO selectivity (97%) suggests that it is a typical reform-
ing catalyst, while the same cannot be said for Fe3Ni1 
(22.2%). Additional experiments showed differences

among the C3H6 yields of Fe3Ni (1.6%) and the respective 
monometallic catalysts (0.4% for Ni and 0.2% for Fe), 
indicating that the two elements operate synergistically.
According to insitu XANES measurements, Ni3Pt/
CeO2 features Pt0, while both Fe3Ni/CeO2 and Ni3Pt/CeO2 
 
include Ni0. By contrast, Fe in Fe3Ni/CeO2 exists in 
oxidized forms that were independently confirmed by 
insitu EXAFS, which suggested the presence of FeOFe 
 
and FeO groups under reaction conditions102. Ofthe 
other bimetallic systems examined, only FeCo 
catalysts 
illustrated a preference to form C3H6, albeit before 
undergoing a rapid deactivation. Insitu XANES results 
showed that Fe3Co1 consists mainly of Co0 and oxidized 
Fe, but the extent of Fe oxidation was lower than that in 
Fe3Ni1, which may be the cause of the lower observed 
steady-
state activity and stability of Fe3Co1/CeO2.
The knowledge that Fe3Ni1/CeO2 comprises Ni0 and 
oxidized Fe motivated a DFT study into both bulk-
terminated Fe3Ni(111) and the FeONi(111) interface. 
The calculations illustrated that both systems should 
energetically favour CH scission (as part of CO2-
ODH) over CC scission (for DRP), although opposite 
behaviour was predicted for Pt-
terminated Ni3Pt(111). 
These results also show that the binding configurations 
of all intermediates on Fe3Ni(111) and Pt-
terminated 
Ni3Pt(111) are similar, and all intermediates bind more 
strongly to the Fe3Ni(111) surface. Thus, Pt-
terminated 
Ni3Pt(111) binds *O only moderately strongly, such 
that it can react rapidly with *CxHy to form *OCxHy, 
an oxygenated intermediate in reforming. Conversely, 
Fe3Ni(111) binds *O strongly, such that the group 
remains on the surface and facilitates selective CH scis-
sion and the formation of C3H6. Overall, the combined 
approach of flow reactor experiments (including kinetic 
measurements), insitu and exsitu characterization, and 
DFT calculations allows chemists to identify and under-
stand the intrinsic activity of heterogeneous catalysts for 
the CO2-ODH of C3H8.
The approach to studying conversions of CO2 and 
C2H6 or C3H8 over FexNiy/CeO2 catalysts is, of course, 
also applicable when C4H10 is used as the alkane feed at 
873K. The reaction pathways are similarly affected by 
the catalyst composition and the choice of support103, 
with flow reactions illustrating that Fe3Ni1/CeO2 favours 
1,3-butadiene formation, while Fe1Ni3/CeO2 favours DR. 
Supporting Fe3Ni1 on different oxides illustrates that

highly reducible supports with mobile lattice O atoms, 
such as CeO2 and CeO2ZrO2, favour the production of 
 
1,3-butadiene, whereas ZrO2 suppresses oxidative 
dehydro
genation activity. According to thermogravimet-
ric analysis and insitu XRD measurements, Fe3Ni1/CeO2 
 
does not readily coke or experience surface metal 
agglomeration under reaction conditions, consistent 
 
with the results obtained for the reactions of CO2  
and C3H8.
Insitu XANES measurements of FexNiy/CeO2 cata-
lysts indicate that its Ni centres are metallic, whereas Fe 
mainly exists as FeOx (ref.103). The linear combination fit-
ting of data for Fe1Ni3/CeO2 indicates that Ni exists solely 
as Ni0, but only a third of the Fe species were reduced to 
Fe0, the remaining fraction being in the form of Fe2O3. 
For the Fe3Ni1 catalyst, 90% of the Ni sites were metallic 
and Fe exists as Fe0 (19%), FeO (7%), Fe3O4 (28%) and 
Fe2O3 (44%). DFT calculations of the oxidative dehydro
genation and reforming pathways on Ni(111) and 
 
FeOx/Ni(111) surfaces predict that Ni(111) should 
favour CC scission, while FeOx/Ni(111) could pro-
mote CH cleavage. Over Ni(111), the initial step of 
CC cleavage is more favourable than the correspond-
ing step in CH scission. At the FeONi(111) interface, 
 
the initial steps in CH and CC cleavage are in com-
petition, but the subsequent two steps of CH scission 
are more energetically favourable and afford surface-
bound 1,3-butadiene. Overall, flow reactor studies of 
FexNiy/CeO2 catalysts for the CO2-ODH of C4H10 provide 
insight into the effect of oxide supports. Two major deac-
tivation pathways  coking and metal agglomeration 
 do not occur when FexNiy catalysts are supported on 
CeO2 during the CO2-ODH of C4H10. More importantly, 
the trends identified in experimental results and DFT 
calculations are similar to those observed using C2H6 
and C3H8, suggesting that the lessons learned concern-
ing the CO2-ODH of light alkanes can be generalized to 
more complex hydrocarbons.
Challenges and opportunities
The tandem reactions of CO2 reduction and CO2-ODH 
of light alkanes have the potential to satisfy global alk-
ene production while consuming underutilized frac-
tions of shale gas and lowering net anthropogenic CO2 
emissions. This chemistry presents several challenges, 
such as the need for a selective bifunctional catalyst that 
can activate CO2 and selectively transform the alkane 
into the respective alkene, even at temperatures at which 
side reactions are highly thermodynamically favourable. 
Attemperatures above 823K, the reactions of CO2 with 
alkanes may simultaneously occur through two distinct 
pathways: CO2-ODH or DR. The toxicity and instabil-
ity of previously examined oxide catalysts motivate the 
development of environmentally benign CO2-ODH cat-
alysts that are highly selective and stable. This Review 
has, thus, focused on catalysts bearing less toxic metals 
and how we can study them using flow reactor exper-
iments, insitu characterization and DFT calculations. 
In this way, we will create a design platform for safer 
catalysts that are intrinsically active and selective for the 
CO2-ODH of light alkanes.
Future research into the CO2-ODH of light alkanes 
should focus on the design of catalysts that give rise to 
improved alkene yields. The combined experimental 
and theoretical methods discussed here can be used to 
identify descriptors such as oxidation state, nature of 
oxygenated intermediates and *O binding energy. These 
parameters indicate how the selectivity and activity of a 
CO2-ODH catalyst arise from its mechanism of action. 
Addressing the dependence of alkene selectivity on the 
binding strength and configuration of all intermedi-
ates can clarify the distinct functions and, possibly, the 
nature of active sites that are necessary for a promising 
CO2-ODH catalyst. Insitu characterization techniques 
can help identify active sites under reaction conditions. 
The identification and subsequent targeted synthesis of 
particular active sites are among the key steps necessary 
to pave the way towards large-
scale commercialization.
The nature of the support influences the CO2-ODH 
mechanism because it can influence how a metal cata-
lyst binds and activates CO2 and alkanes. Systems that 
feature a reducible oxide support such as CeO2 warrant 
further investigation, as do systems featuring metal-
modified carbide catalysts. We have emphasized here the 
importance of redox activity and lattice O atom mobility 
in CO2 activation, but the correlation between O storage 
capacity/mobility and alkene yields is not well under-
stood. Further examining the role of oxide supports in

CO2-ODH catalysts will enable a more rational optimi-
zation of both activity and selectivity for alkene prod-
ucts. Thus, it is of interest to target high-
surface-area 
oxide supports with high concentrations of sites that 
enable CO2 activation87.
CO2-ODH reactions will ultimately produce a mix-
ture of alkenes, H2O and CO, which are present with the 
unreacted CO2 and alkane feed. Once we have identified 
suitable catalysts and conditions, it will be necessary to 
address a further problem  separating the gaseous 
species. Thus, scale-
up will require creative solutions 
in the form of reactive separation methods or process 
designs, the latter taking the form of novel reactors or 
separators. To make a more substantial dent in anthro-
pogenic CO2 emissions, it would be highly desirable to 
directly use CO2-ODH product mixtures as feeds for 
useful chemistries. For instance, it would be attractive to 
oxidatively couple CO2 with alkenes to produce acrylic 
acids and acrylate in a one-
step process that would 
replace an energy-
intensive, two-
step methodology 
(alkene to acrolein, followed by acrolein to acrylate)13. 
Equally ambitious would be the heterogeneous catalysis 
of C2H4 hydroformylation104. However, heterogeneous 
hydroformylation chemistries typically result in poorer 
performance than their well-
established homogeneous 
counterparts, due to a lack of fundamental mechanistic 
understanding of heterogeneous catalysts.
The one-
pot synthesis of oxygenates from CO2 and 
light alkanes105, using a single or consecutive catalyst bed 
arrangement, is highly desirable because it facilitates 
reactive separations by producing value-
added oxygen-
ates such as C3H7OH (ref.106). Another possible scheme, 
which could run under similar conditions to CO2-ODH, 
involves tandem reactions of CO2-assisted oxidative 
dehydrogenation and aromatization of light alkanes. The 
direct transformation of alkanes into aromatics without 
the need for naphtha is economically attractive and also 
increases the consumption of CO2 per mole of value-
added product, which is more easily separated because 
the aromatics typically exist as liquids.
Overall, CO2 reduction in tandem with light-
alkane 
transformations over specialized bifunctional catalysts 
has the potential to produce alkenes while eliminating 
a greenhouse gas. Before these reactions can be imple-
mented on a large scale, we must address challenges such 
as catalyst development, finding optimal synthesis tech-
niques and product separation. We have focused here 
on how to characterize catalyst platforms through com-
bined experimental and theoretical efforts, which can 
provide the crucial mechanistic understanding required 
to expedite the development of selective and stable 
 
CO2-ODH catalysts.

First, you need to sequentially extract any quotes in the literature that are most relevant to each question, and print them in numbered order, separated by newlines. Quotes should be relatively brief. Do not attempt to summarize or answer questions at this stage, but simply repeat exactly what the corresponding part of the literature says.

Please enclose the full list of quotes in <quotes></quotes> XML tags. If there are no relevant quotes, write "No relevant quotes" instead.

Then, answer the question, starting with "Answer:".  Do not include or reference quoted content verbatim in the answer. Don't say "According to Quote [1]" when answering. Do not write reference number of quotes after answer. Put your answer to the user inside <EnglishVersionAnswer></EnglishVersionAnswer> XML tags. Output formatted text, with line breaks for each question.Separate quotes and answers with a blank line. Provide the answers to all questions in English. After completing the English answers, translate all those answers into Chinese and provide the Chinese version inside <ChineseVersionAnswer></ChineseVersionAnswer> XML tags.

Thus, the format of your overall response should look like what's shown between the <example></example> tags.  Make sure to follow the formatting and spacing exactly.
