[1] "The increasing importance of shale gas production as a source of energy has initiated significant changes in the petrochemical industry."

[2] "As oil prices remain high, naphtha crackers are, therefore, being converted to ethane crackers in the USA for the production of ethylene. As the former installations produce significant amounts of propylene, and the latter do not, this has resulted in a shortage of propylene and consequent increased prices."

[3] "At these market conditions, the production of propylene by the dehydrogenation of propane has become commercially very attractive, which is highlighted by the announcement of dozens of new installations."

[4] "Two processes have been applied industrially for the dehydrogenation of propane, namely the Catofin and Oleflex processes. The former uses a CrOx/Al2O3 catalyst in a fixed bed reactor."

The growing demand for propylene has been influenced by changes in the petrochemical industry due to increased shale gas production. The conversion of naphtha crackers to ethane crackers in the USA has led to a shortage of propylene, as ethane crackers produce less propylene. This shortage and resulting price increases have made propane dehydrogenation (PDH) an attractive method for propylene production, leading to the announcement of many new PDH installations.

The literature does not provide information about Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts for PDH or any debate about active Ga species. Instead, it mentions that the Catofin process, which uses a CrOx/Al2O3 catalyst in a fixed bed reactor, is one of the two main industrial processes for propane dehydrogenation. The document does not discuss recent research findings or current knowledge about Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts for PDH.

由于页岩气生产的增加，石化行业发生了变化，这影响了丙烯的需求增长。在美国，将石脑油裂解装置转换为乙烷裂解装置导致了丙烯短缺，因为乙烷裂解装置产生的丙烯较少。这种短缺和随之而来的价格上涨使得丙烷脱氢（PDH）成为一种有吸引力的丙烯生产方法，导致了许多新的PDH装置的宣布。

文献中没有提供关于Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂用于PDH的信息，也没有提到关于活性Ga物种的任何争论。相反，它提到Catofin工艺是两种主要的工业丙烷脱氢工艺之一，该工艺在固定床反应器中使用CrOx/Al2O3催化剂。文档没有讨论关于Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂用于PDH的最新研究发现或当前知识。
