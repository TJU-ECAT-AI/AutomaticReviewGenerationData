[1] "The increasing importance of shale gas production as a source of energy has initiated significant changes in the petrochemical industry."

[2] "As oil prices remain high, naphtha crackers are, therefore, being converted to ethane crackers in the USA for the production of ethylene. As the former installations produce significant amounts of propylene, and the latter do not, this has resulted in a shortage of propylene and consequent increased prices."

[3] "At these market conditions, the production of propylene by the dehydrogenation of propane has become commercially very attractive, which is highlighted by the announcement of dozens of new installations."

The growing demand for propylene has been influenced by changes in the petrochemical industry due to increased shale gas production. As naphtha crackers are converted to ethane crackers for ethylene production, there has been a resulting shortage of propylene, leading to increased prices. This has made propane dehydrogenation (PDH) an attractive method for propylene production, with many new installations being announced.

The literature does not provide information on Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts for PDH, the debate about active Ga species, or recent research findings related to these catalysts. The document focuses on CrOx/Al2O3 catalysts instead.

由于页岩气生产的增加，石油化工行业发生了重大变化，这影响了丙烯的需求增长。随着石脑油裂解装置转变为乙烷裂解装置以生产乙烯，导致丙烯供应短缺，价格上涨。这使得丙烷脱氢(PDH)成为一种具有吸引力的丙烯生产方法，许多新装置正在宣布建设。

文献中没有提供关于Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂用于PDH的信息，也没有涉及活性Ga物种的争论或与这些催化剂相关的最新研究发现。文档主要集中在CrOx/Al2O3催化剂上。
