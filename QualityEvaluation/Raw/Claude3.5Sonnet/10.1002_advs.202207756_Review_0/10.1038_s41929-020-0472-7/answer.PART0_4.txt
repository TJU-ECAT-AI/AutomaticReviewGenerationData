<EnglishVersionAnswer>

The provided literature does not contain information directly relevant to answering the question about the growing demand for propylene, development of propane dehydrogenation (PDH) methods, or the evolution of understanding Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts for PDH. The text focuses on PtSn catalysts supported on MFI zeolite for propane dehydrogenation, but does not discuss Ga-based catalysts or the broader context of propylene demand and production methods. Therefore, this specific question cannot be adequately answered based solely on the given document.

所提供的文献并不包含直接相关的信息来回答关于丙烯需求增长、丙烷脱氢(PDH)方法的发展,或者对Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂用于PDH的理解演变的问题。该文本主要关注MFI沸石负载的PtSn催化剂用于丙烷脱氢,但并未讨论基于Ga的催化剂或丙烯需求和生产方法的更广泛背景。因此,仅基于给定文档无法充分回答这个特定问题。
