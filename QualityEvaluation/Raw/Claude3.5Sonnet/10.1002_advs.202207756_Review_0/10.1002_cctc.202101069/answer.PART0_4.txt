[1] "Propylene is a vital and basic building block and used for production of a variety of chemicals such as polypropylene, acrylic acid and acrylonitrile."

[2] "However, the current production capacity cannot fully meet the rapidly increasing demand."

[3] "As the hydraulic fracturing technology improves, large volumes of shale gas containing propane can be extracted and direct propane dehydrogenation (PDH) attracts wide attention for propylene production with the advantage of less byproducts."

The growing demand for propylene has led to the development of new production methods, particularly propane dehydrogenation (PDH). Traditional production methods like steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) are unable to meet the rapidly increasing demand for propylene. As a result, PDH has gained attention as an alternative method for propylene production. This shift has been further facilitated by improvements in hydraulic fracturing technology, which has increased the availability of propane from shale gas. PDH offers the advantage of producing fewer byproducts compared to traditional methods.

The literature provided does not contain specific information about the evolution of understanding Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts for PDH, the debate about active Ga species, or recent research findings related to these catalysts. The document focuses more on ZnO-based catalysts supported on silicalite-1 for PDH reactions.

丙烯需求的增长推动了新生产方法的发展,特别是丙烷脱氢(PDH)。传统的生产方法如蒸汽裂解和流化催化裂化(FCC)无法满足快速增长的丙烯需求。因此,PDH作为丙烯生产的替代方法引起了关注。这一转变进一步得益于水力压裂技术的改进,增加了从页岩气中获取丙烷的可能性。与传统方法相比,PDH具有产生较少副产品的优势。

所提供的文献没有包含关于Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂在PDH中应用的理解演变、活性Ga物种的争论,或与这些催化剂相关的最新研究发现的具体信息。该文档更多地关注了以硅酸盐-1为载体的ZnO基催化剂在PDH反应中的应用。
