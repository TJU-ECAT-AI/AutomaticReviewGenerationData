The growing demand for propylene has led to the development of new production methods, particularly propane dehydrogenation (PDH). Traditional methods like steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) have been unable to meet the increasing demand. The advancement of hydraulic fracturing technology has made large volumes of propane-containing shale gas available, making PDH an attractive option for propylene production with fewer byproducts.

While the literature does not specifically discuss the evolution of understanding Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts for PDH or debates about active Ga species, it does mention that various catalysts including Zn, V, Zr, Co, and Fe-based ones have been studied for PDH. Among these, Zn-based catalysts have gained more attention due to their low cost and environmentally friendly properties. However, the document does not provide specific information about recent research findings or current knowledge regarding Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts for PDH.

丙烯需求的增长推动了新生产方法的发展，特别是丙烷脱氢(PDH)。传统的蒸汽裂解和流化催化裂化(FCC)方法已无法满足日益增长的需求。水力压裂技术的进步使得大量含丙烷的页岩气可以被开采，使PDH成为一种具有吸引力的丙烯生产选择，且副产品较少。

虽然文献中没有具体讨论对Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂在PDH中的理解演变或关于活性Ga物种的争论，但确实提到了包括Zn、V、Zr、Co和Fe基在内的各种催化剂已被研究用于PDH。其中，Zn基催化剂因其低成本和环境友好的特性而受到更多关注。然而，该文档并未提供关于Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂在PDH中的最新研究发现或当前知识的具体信息。
