[1] "Propylene is a vital and basic building block and used for production of a variety of chemicals such as polypropylene, acrylic acid and acrylonitrile."

[2] "However, the current production capacity cannot fully meet the rapidly increasing demand."

[3] "As the hydraulic fracturing technology improves, large volumes of shale gas containing propane can be extracted and direct propane dehydrogenation (PDH) attracts wide attention for propylene production with the advantage of less byproducts."

The growing demand for propylene has led to the development of new production methods, particularly propane dehydrogenation (PDH). Traditional production methods like steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking have been unable to meet the increasing demand for propylene. As hydraulic fracturing technology has improved, allowing for extraction of large volumes of shale gas containing propane, PDH has gained attention as an attractive method for propylene production. PDH offers the advantage of producing fewer byproducts compared to other methods.

The literature provided does not contain information about the evolution of understanding Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts for PDH, the debate about active Ga species, or recent research findings related to these catalysts. Therefore, this part of the question cannot be answered based on the given information.

丙烯需求的增长推动了新生产方法的发展，特别是丙烷脱氢(PDH)。传统的生产方法如蒸汽裂解和流化催化裂解无法满足日益增长的丙烯需求。随着水力压裂技术的改进，可以提取含有大量丙烷的页岩气，PDH作为一种有吸引力的丙烯生产方法引起了广泛关注。与其他方法相比，PDH具有产生较少副产品的优势。

提供的文献中没有关于Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂在PDH中的理解演变、活性Ga物种的争论或与这些催化剂相关的最新研究发现的信息。因此，基于给定的信息无法回答问题的这一部分。
