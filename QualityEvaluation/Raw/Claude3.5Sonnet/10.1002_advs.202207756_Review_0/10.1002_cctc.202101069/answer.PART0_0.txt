[1] "Propylene is a vital and basic building block and used for production of a variety of chemicals such as polypropylene, acrylic acid and acrylonitrile."

[2] "However, the current production capacity cannot fully meet the rapidly increasing demand."

[3] "As the hydraulic fracturing technology improves, large volumes of shale gas containing propane can be extracted and direct propane dehydrogenation (PDH) attracts wide attention for propylene production with the advantage of less byproducts."

The growing demand for propylene has led to the development of new production methods, particularly propane dehydrogenation (PDH). Traditional production methods like petroleum-derived steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) have been unable to meet the rapidly increasing demand for propylene. As a result, PDH has gained attention as an on-purpose strategy for propylene production.

The development of PDH has been influenced by advances in hydraulic fracturing technology, which has made large volumes of propane-containing shale gas available. PDH offers the advantage of producing fewer byproducts compared to traditional methods.

Regarding Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts for PDH, the provided literature does not contain specific information about their evolution or the debate surrounding active Ga species. The document focuses primarily on ZnO-based catalysts supported on silicalite-1 (S-1) zeolite. Therefore, I cannot provide information on the current knowledge or recent research findings related to Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts for PDH based on this literature.

丙烯需求的增长推动了新生产方法的发展，特别是丙烷脱氢(PDH)。传统的生产方法，如石油衍生的蒸汽裂解和流化催化裂化(FCC)，已经无法满足快速增长的丙烯需求。因此，PDH作为一种有目的的丙烯生产策略引起了广泛关注。

PDH的发展受到水力压裂技术进步的影响，这项技术使得大量含丙烷的页岩气可以被开采。与传统方法相比，PDH具有产生较少副产品的优势。

关于Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂在PDH中的应用，所提供的文献中并没有包含其演变或关于活性Ga物种争论的具体信息。该文档主要集中在以硅铝酸盐-1(S-1)沸石为载体的ZnO基催化剂上。因此，基于这篇文献，我无法提供关于Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂在PDH中的当前知识或最新研究发现的信息。
