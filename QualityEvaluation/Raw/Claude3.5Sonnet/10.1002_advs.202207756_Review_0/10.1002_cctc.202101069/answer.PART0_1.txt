[1] "Propylene is a vital and basic building block and used for production of a variety of chemicals such as polypropylene, acrylic acid and acrylonitrile."

[2] "However, the current production capacity cannot fully meet the rapidly increasing demand."

[3] "As the hydraulic fracturing technology improves, large volumes of shale gas containing propane can be extracted and direct propane dehydrogenation (PDH) attracts wide attention for propylene production with the advantage of less byproducts."

The growing demand for propylene has led to the development of new production methods, particularly propane dehydrogenation (PDH). This is because traditional production methods like steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking cannot meet the rapidly increasing demand. PDH has attracted attention as an alternative method, especially with the increased availability of propane from shale gas extraction through hydraulic fracturing. PDH offers the advantage of producing fewer byproducts compared to traditional methods.

Regarding Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts for PDH, the literature provided does not contain specific information about their evolution or the debate surrounding active Ga species. The document focuses more on ZnO-based catalysts supported on silicalite-1 (S-1) zeolite. Therefore, I cannot provide an accurate answer about the development of understanding or recent research findings related to Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts for PDH based on the given information.

丙烯需求的增长推动了新生产方法的发展，特别是丙烷脱氢（PDH）。这是因为传统的生产方法如蒸汽裂解和流化催化裂解无法满足快速增长的需求。PDH作为替代方法引起了关注，特别是随着通过水力压裂从页岩气中提取丙烷的可用性增加。与传统方法相比，PDH具有产生较少副产品的优势。

关于Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂用于PDH，所提供的文献中没有包含其演变或围绕活性Ga物种的争论的具体信息。该文档更多地关注了以硅铝酸盐-1（S-1）沸石为载体的ZnO基催化剂。因此，基于给定的信息，我无法提供关于Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂用于PDH的理解发展或最近研究发现的准确答案。
