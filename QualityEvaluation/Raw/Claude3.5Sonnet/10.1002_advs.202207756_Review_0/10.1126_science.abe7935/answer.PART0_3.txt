[1] "Propene (14) has been extensively used as a building unit for the production of plastics, fibers, and intermediates for the synthesis of fine chemicals. The current method for propene production predominantly relies on the steam cracking of heavy hydrocarbons in naphtha, but production using this method is still far from meeting the demands for propene, 116,000,000 tons in 2020."

[2] "Recently, shale gas, which contains abundant propane, has been regarded as a promising source for propene to reduce dependence on petroleum. Nonoxidative dehydrogenation of propane has emerged as industrial technologies such as Oleflex by Honeywell UOP and Catofin by ABB Lumus (1, 2, 59) have been developed, but these have insufficient lifetimes because of thermodynamically favorable coke formation and metal sintering, which require frequent catalyst regeneration."

[3] "By contrast, oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) has substantial advantages regarding exothermic features and hindrance of coke formation but is easily overoxidized to form valueless CO2 (1018), and this remains a challenge for practical applications."

The growing demand for propylene has driven the development of new production methods, particularly propane dehydrogenation (PDH). This is due to the fact that traditional methods like steam cracking of naphtha are unable to meet the increasing demand for propylene, which reached 116 million tons in 2020. 

Shale gas, rich in propane, has emerged as a promising alternative source for propylene production. This has led to the development of non-oxidative propane dehydrogenation technologies such as Oleflex by Honeywell UOP and Catofin by ABB Lumus. However, these technologies face challenges related to catalyst lifetime due to coke formation and metal sintering, necessitating frequent catalyst regeneration.

Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) has been explored as an alternative, offering advantages in terms of exothermic reaction conditions and reduced coke formation. However, ODHP faces its own challenge of overoxidation, leading to the formation of valueless CO2.

The literature does not provide specific information about Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts for PDH or the debate about active Ga species. Therefore, the evolution of understanding these catalysts and recent research findings cannot be addressed based on the given text.

丙烯需求的增长推动了新生产方法的发展，特别是丙烷脱氢（PDH）。这是因为传统的石脑油蒸汽裂解方法无法满足日益增长的丙烯需求，2020年丙烯需求量达到1.16亿吨。

富含丙烷的页岩气已成为丙烯生产的一个有前景的替代来源。这导致了非氧化丙烷脱氢技术的发展，如霍尼韦尔UOP的Oleflex和ABB Lumus的Catofin。然而，这些技术面临着由于结焦和金属烧结导致的催化剂寿命问题，需要频繁进行催化剂再生。

丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）被探索作为一种替代方法，在放热反应条件和减少结焦方面具有优势。然而，ODHP面临着过度氧化的挑战，导致形成无价值的CO2。

文献中没有提供关于Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂用于PDH或活性Ga物种争论的具体信息。因此，基于给定的文本无法讨论对这些催化剂理解的演变和最近的研究发现。
