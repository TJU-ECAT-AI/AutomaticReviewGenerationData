[1] "Propene (14) has been extensively used as a building unit for the production of plastics, fibers, and intermediates for the synthesis of fine chemicals. The current method for propene production predominantly relies on the steam cracking of heavy hydrocarbons in naphtha, but production using this method is still far from meeting the demands for propene, 116,000,000 tons in 2020."

[2] "Recently, shale gas, which contains abundant propane, has been regarded as a promising source for propene to reduce dependence on petroleum. Nonoxidative dehydrogenation of propane has emerged as industrial technologies such as Oleflex by Honeywell UOP and Catofin by ABB Lumus (1, 2, 59) have been developed, but these have insufficient lifetimes because of thermodynamically favorable coke formation and metal sintering, which require frequent catalyst regeneration."

[3] "By contrast, oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) has substantial advantages regarding exothermic features and hindrance of coke formation but is easily overoxidized to form valueless CO2 (1018), and this remains a challenge for practical applications."

The growing demand for propylene has significantly influenced the development of new production methods, particularly propane dehydrogenation (PDH). The traditional method of steam cracking heavy hydrocarbons in naphtha is no longer sufficient to meet the increasing demand for propene, which reached 116 million tons in 2020. This has led to the exploration of alternative sources and methods.

Shale gas, rich in propane, has emerged as a promising source for propene production, reducing dependence on petroleum. Non-oxidative propane dehydrogenation technologies like Oleflex and Catofin have been developed, but they face challenges such as coke formation and metal sintering, necessitating frequent catalyst regeneration.

Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) has been explored as an alternative, offering advantages like exothermic features and reduced coke formation. However, ODHP faces its own challenge of easy overoxidation to form CO2, which remains a hurdle for practical applications.

The document does not specifically discuss Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts for PDH or the debate about active Ga species. Therefore, the evolution of understanding these catalysts and recent research findings related to Ga/H-ZSM-5 cannot be addressed based on the given information.

丙烯需求的增长显著影响了新生产方法的开发，特别是丙烷脱氢（PDH）。传统的重质烃蒸汽裂解方法已不足以满足日益增长的丙烯需求，2020年丙烯需求量达到1.16亿吨。这促使人们探索替代来源和方法。

富含丙烷的页岩气已成为丙烯生产的一个有前途的来源，减少了对石油的依赖。非氧化丙烷脱氢技术如Oleflex和Catofin已经开发出来，但它们面临着积碳形成和金属烧结等挑战，需要频繁进行催化剂再生。

丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）被探索作为一种替代方法，具有放热特性和减少积碳形成等优势。然而，ODHP面临着容易过度氧化生成CO2的挑战，这仍然是实际应用的一个障碍。

文档中没有具体讨论Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂用于PDH或关于活性Ga物种的争论。因此，基于给定信息无法讨论对这些催化剂的理解演变和与Ga/H-ZSM-5相关的最新研究发现。
