[1] "Propene (14) has been extensively used as a building unit for the production of plastics, fibers, and intermediates for the synthesis of fine chemicals. The current method for propene production predominantly relies on the steam cracking of heavy hydrocarbons in naphtha, but production using this method is still far from meeting the demands for propene, 116,000,000 tons in 2020."

[2] "Recently, shale gas, which contains abundant propane, has been regarded as a promising source for propene to reduce dependence on petroleum. Nonoxidative dehydrogenation of propane has emerged as industrial technologies such as Oleflex by Honeywell UOP and Catofin by ABB Lumus (1, 2, 59) have been developed, but these have insufficient lifetimes because of thermodynamically favorable coke formation and metal sintering, which require frequent catalyst regeneration."

[3] "By contrast, oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) has substantial advantages regarding exothermic features and hindrance of coke formation but is easily overoxidized to form valueless CO2 (1018), and this remains a challenge for practical applications."

The growing demand for propylene has led to the development of new production methods, particularly propane dehydrogenation (PDH). This is evident from the fact that traditional methods like steam cracking of naphtha are unable to meet the current demand of 116 million tons as of 2020. 

Shale gas, rich in propane, has emerged as a promising alternative source for propene production. Two main approaches have been developed: non-oxidative and oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP).

Non-oxidative PDH technologies like Oleflex and Catofin have been industrialized, but they face challenges such as coke formation and metal sintering, requiring frequent catalyst regeneration. 

ODHP offers advantages in terms of being exothermic and reducing coke formation. However, it faces the challenge of overoxidation, leading to the formation of valueless CO2.

The literature does not provide specific information about the evolution of understanding Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts for PDH, the debate about active Ga species, or recent research findings related to these catalysts. The focus of the provided text is on boron-based catalysts for ODHP rather than gallium-based catalysts for PDH.

丙烯需求的增长推动了新生产方法的开发，特别是丙烷脱氢（PDH）。这从传统方法如石脑油蒸汽裂解无法满足2020年1.16亿吨的当前需求这一事实中可以看出。

富含丙烷的页岩气已成为丙烯生产的一种有前景的替代来源。已开发出两种主要方法：非氧化和氧化丙烷脱氢（ODHP）。

非氧化PDH技术如Oleflex和Catofin已经实现工业化，但面临诸如积碳和金属烧结等挑战，需要频繁的催化剂再生。

ODHP在放热和减少积碳方面具有优势。然而，它面临过度氧化的挑战，导致形成无价值的CO2。

文献中没有提供关于Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂在PDH中的理解演变、活性Ga物种的争论或与这些催化剂相关的最新研究发现的具体信息。提供的文本主要关注用于ODHP的硼基催化剂，而不是用于PDH的镓基催化剂。
