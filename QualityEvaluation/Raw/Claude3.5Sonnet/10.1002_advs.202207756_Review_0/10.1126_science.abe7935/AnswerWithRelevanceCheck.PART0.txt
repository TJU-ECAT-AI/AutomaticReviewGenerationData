          [1] "Propene (14) has been extensively used as a building unit for the production of plastics, fibers, and intermediates for the synthesis of fine chemicals. The current method for propene production predominantly relies on the steam cracking of heavy hydrocarbons in naphtha, but production using this method is still far from meeting the demands for propene, 116,000,000 tons in 2020."

          [2] "Recently, shale gas, which contains abundant propane, has been regarded as a promising source for propene to reduce dependence on petroleum. Nonoxidative dehydrogenation of propane has emerged as industrial technologies such as Oleflex by Honeywell UOP and Catofin by ABB Lumus (1, 2, 59) have been developed, but these have insufficient lifetimes because of thermodynamically favorable coke formation and metal sintering, which require frequent catalyst regeneration."

          [3] "By contrast, oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) has substantial advantages regarding exothermic features and hindrance of coke formation but is easily overoxidized to form valueless CO2 (1018), and this remains a challenge for practical applications."

          The growing demand for propylene has significantly influenced the development of new production methods, particularly propane dehydrogenation (PDH). Traditional methods like steam cracking of naphtha are unable to meet the increasing demand, which reached 116 million tons in 2020. This has led to the exploration of alternative sources and methods:

          1. Shale gas, rich in propane, has emerged as a promising source for propene production.
          
          2. Non-oxidative propane dehydrogenation technologies like Oleflex and Catofin have been developed but face challenges such as coke formation and metal sintering, requiring frequent catalyst regeneration.
          
          3. Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) offers advantages in terms of exothermic features and reduced coke formation but faces challenges with overoxidation leading to CO2 formation.

          The provided information does not discuss Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts for PDH or the debate about active Ga species. Therefore, the evolution of understanding these catalysts and recent research findings related to Ga/H-ZSM-5 cannot be addressed based on the given information.

          丙烯需求的增长显著影响了新生产方法的开发，特别是丙烷脱氢（PDH）。传统的石脑油蒸汽裂解方法无法满足日益增长的需求，2020年需求量达到1.16亿吨。这导致了替代来源和方法的探索：

          1. 富含丙烷的页岩气已成为丙烯生产的一个有前景的来源。

          2. 非氧化丙烷脱氢技术如Oleflex和Catofin已经开发出来，但面临着积碳形成和金属烧结等挑战，需要频繁进行催化剂再生。

          3. 丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）在放热特性和减少积碳形成方面具有优势，但面临过度氧化生成CO2的挑战。

          提供的信息没有讨论Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂用于PDH或关于活性Ga物种的争论。因此，基于给定信息无法讨论对这些催化剂的理解演变和与Ga/H-ZSM-5相关的最新研究发现。
