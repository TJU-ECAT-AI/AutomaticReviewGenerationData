[1] "Propene (14) has been extensively used as a building unit for the production of plastics, fibers, and intermediates for the synthesis of fine chemicals. The current method for propene production predominantly relies on the steam cracking of heavy hydrocarbons in naphtha, but production using this method is still far from meeting the demands for propene, 116,000,000 tons in 2020."

[2] "Recently, shale gas, which contains abundant propane, has been regarded as a promising source for propene to reduce dependence on petroleum. Nonoxidative dehydrogenation of propane has emerged as industrial technologies such as Oleflex by Honeywell UOP and Catofin by ABB Lumus (1, 2, 59) have been developed, but these have insufficient lifetimes because of thermodynamically favorable coke formation and metal sintering, which require frequent catalyst regeneration."

[3] "By contrast, oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) has substantial advantages regarding exothermic features and hindrance of coke formation but is easily overoxidized to form valueless CO2 (1018), and this remains a challenge for practical applications."

The growing demand for propylene has led to the development of new production methods, particularly propane dehydrogenation (PDH), as traditional methods like steam cracking of naphtha are unable to meet the increasing demand. The literature mentions that propylene demand reached 116 million tons in 2020, far exceeding current production capabilities.

In response to this demand, new technologies have emerged, including non-oxidative propane dehydrogenation processes like Oleflex and Catofin. However, these processes face challenges such as coke formation and metal sintering, requiring frequent catalyst regeneration.

Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) has been explored as an alternative, offering advantages in terms of exothermic features and reduced coke formation. However, ODHP faces its own challenges, particularly the tendency for overoxidation to form CO2.

The literature does not specifically discuss Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts for PDH or the debate about active Ga species. The focus of this text is on boron-based catalysts for ODHP, particularly isolated boron in zeolite frameworks. Therefore, the question regarding the evolution of understanding Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts cannot be answered based on the provided literature.

丙烯需求的增长推动了新生产方法的开发，特别是丙烷脱氢(PDH)，因为传统的石脑油蒸汽裂解方法无法满足不断增长的需求。文献提到，2020年丙烯需求达到1.16亿吨，远远超过当前的生产能力。

为了应对这一需求，新技术应运而生，包括Oleflex和Catofin等非氧化丙烷脱氢工艺。然而，这些工艺面临着焦炭形成和金属烧结等挑战，需要频繁进行催化剂再生。

丙烷氧化脱氢(ODHP)被作为一种替代方案进行探索，在放热特性和减少焦炭形成方面具有优势。但是，ODHP也面临着自身的挑战，特别是容易过度氧化形成二氧化碳。

文献中没有具体讨论用于PDH的Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂或关于活性Ga物种的争论。本文的重点是用于ODHP的硼基催化剂，特别是沸石骨架中的孤立硼。因此，基于所提供的文献无法回答关于理解Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂演变的问题。

The growing demand for propylene has driven the development of new production methods, particularly propane dehydrogenation (PDH). The traditional method of steam cracking heavy hydrocarbons in naphtha is insufficient to meet the current demand for propene, which reached 116 million tons in 2020. As a result, shale gas, rich in propane, has emerged as a promising alternative source for propene production.

Two main approaches have been developed for propane dehydrogenation:

1. Non-oxidative dehydrogenation: Industrial technologies like Oleflex and Catofin have been implemented. However, these processes face challenges due to coke formation and metal sintering, requiring frequent catalyst regeneration.

2. Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP): This method offers advantages in terms of exothermic features and reduced coke formation. However, it faces the challenge of overoxidation, leading to the formation of valueless CO2.

The literature does not provide information specifically about Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts for PDH or the debate about active Ga species. The focus of the given text is on boron-based catalysts for ODHP, rather than gallium-based catalysts for PDH. Therefore, the part of the question related to Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts cannot be answered based on the provided information.

丙烯需求的增长推动了新生产方法的发展，特别是丙烷脱氢（PDH）。传统的重质烃蒸汽裂解法已不足以满足当前的丙烯需求，2020年丙烯需求量达到1.16亿吨。因此，富含丙烷的页岩气已成为丙烯生产的一个有前景的替代来源。

丙烷脱氢主要开发了两种方法：

1. 非氧化脱氢：已实施了Oleflex和Catofin等工业技术。但是，这些过程面临由于焦炭形成和金属烧结而导致的挑战，需要频繁的催化剂再生。

2. 丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）：这种方法在放热特性和减少焦炭形成方面具有优势。然而，它面临过度氧化的挑战，导致形成无价值的二氧化碳。

文献中没有提供关于Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂用于PDH或活性Ga物种争议的具体信息。给定文本的重点是用于ODHP的硼基催化剂，而不是用于PDH的镓基催化剂。因此，基于所提供的信息，无法回答与Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂相关的问题部分。

The growing demand for propylene has led to the development of new production methods, particularly propane dehydrogenation (PDH). This is evident from the fact that traditional methods like steam cracking of naphtha are unable to meet the current demand of 116 million tons as of 2020. 

Shale gas, rich in propane, has emerged as a promising alternative source for propene production. Two main approaches have been developed: non-oxidative and oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP).

Non-oxidative PDH technologies like Oleflex and Catofin have been industrialized, but they face challenges such as coke formation and metal sintering, requiring frequent catalyst regeneration. 

ODHP offers advantages in terms of being exothermic and reducing coke formation. However, it faces the challenge of overoxidation, leading to the formation of valueless CO2.
