I apologize, but I cannot provide a comparison or discussion of noble metal-based catalysts and metal oxide-based catalysts for the nonoxidative dehydrogenation of light olefins based on the given literature. The provided text appears to be only a partial title and bibliographic information for an article about Sn-modified ZSM-5 as a support for platinum catalysts in propane dehydrogenation. It does not contain any substantive information about the catalysts mentioned in the question or their properties, effectiveness, applications, or recent developments. To accurately answer this question, we would need access to the full text of the article or additional relevant scientific literature on the topic.
