The given scientific literature does not contain information comparing noble metal-based catalysts and metal oxide-based catalysts for light olefin dehydrogenation. The document focuses specifically on PtSn catalysts supported on Al2O3 and ZnAl2O4 for propane dehydrogenation. It does not discuss other metal oxide catalysts like CrOx, gallium, indium, vanadium, zinc, and molybdenum oxides. 

The literature examines the performance, stability, and characterization of PtSn/Al2O3 and PtSn/ZnAl2O4 catalysts, including their alloy phases and coke formation. It does not provide a broader comparison of different catalyst types or discuss their industrial applications and recent developments in the field of light olefin dehydrogenation.

To properly answer this question would require information from additional sources beyond what is provided in the given document.

The given literature does not contain information to directly compare and contrast noble metal-based catalysts (particularly platinum) with metal oxide-based catalysts for light olefin dehydrogenation. The document focuses specifically on platinum-tin (PtSn) catalysts supported on alumina and zinc aluminate for propane dehydrogenation. It does not discuss other metal oxide catalysts like chromium, gallium, indium, vanadium, zinc or molybdenum oxides.

However, based on the information provided, we can infer some details about platinum-based catalysts:

1. Composition: The study examines PtSn bimetallic catalysts supported on Al2O3 and ZnAl2O4. The loading amounts of Pt and Sn were 3.0 wt% on each catalyst.

2. Effectiveness: PtSn catalysts showed good activity for propane dehydrogenation, with the PtSn/ZnAl2O4 catalyst demonstrating higher stability than PtSn/Al2O3. 

3. Recent developments: The research investigates the formation and transition of PtSn alloy phases during reaction and their impact on catalyst stability and coke mobility.

4. Potential advantages: PtSn bimetallic catalysts showed improved stability and lower coke formation compared to monometallic Pt catalysts. The addition of Sn as a promoter lessened coke generation.

The document does not provide information to compare these aspects with metal oxide-based catalysts or discuss their relative industrial applications in light olefin dehydrogenation.

给定的文献不包含直接比较和对比贵金属基催化剂（特别是铂）与金属氧化物基催化剂用于轻烯烃脱氢的信息。该文档专门讨论了以氧化铝和锌铝尖晶石为载体的铂-锡（PtSn）催化剂用于丙烷脱氢。它没有讨论其他金属氧化物催化剂，如铬、镓、铟、钒、锌或钼氧化物。

然而，根据提供的信息，我们可以推断出一些关于铂基催化剂的细节：

1. 组成：该研究考察了以Al2O3和ZnAl2O4为载体的PtSn双金属催化剂。每种催化剂的Pt和Sn的负载量为3.0 wt%。

2. 有效性：PtSn催化剂在丙烷脱氢反应中表现出良好的活性，其中PtSn/ZnAl2O4催化剂比PtSn/Al2O3表现出更高的稳定性。

3. 最新发展：该研究调查了反应过程中PtSn合金相的形成和转变，以及它们对催化剂稳定性和积炭流动性的影响。

4. 潜在优势：与单金属Pt催化剂相比，PtSn双金属催化剂表现出改善的稳定性和较低的积炭形成。添加Sn作为助剂减少了积炭的生成。

该文档没有提供与金属氧化物基催化剂比较这些方面的信息，也没有讨论它们在轻烯烃脱氢中的相对工业应用。

The document focuses specifically on PtSn catalysts supported on Al2O3 and ZnAl2O4 for propane dehydrogenation. It does not discuss other metal oxide catalysts like CrOx, gallium, indium, vanadium, zinc, and molybdenum oxides.

From the limited information provided, we can infer that:

1. Platinum-based catalysts, particularly PtSn alloys, are effective for propane dehydrogenation.

2. The support material (Al2O3 vs ZnAl2O4) affects catalyst performance and stability.

3. PtSn/ZnAl2O4 showed better stability and coke resistance compared to PtSn/Al2O3.

4. The type of PtSn alloy formed (PtSn vs Pt3Sn) impacts catalyst deactivation rates.

5. Recent developments focus on understanding alloy formation, phase transitions, and coke mobility to improve catalyst performance.

However, the document does not provide information to compare these platinum-based catalysts with other metal oxide catalysts in terms of compositions, effectiveness, industrial applications, or potential advantages for light olefin dehydrogenation.
