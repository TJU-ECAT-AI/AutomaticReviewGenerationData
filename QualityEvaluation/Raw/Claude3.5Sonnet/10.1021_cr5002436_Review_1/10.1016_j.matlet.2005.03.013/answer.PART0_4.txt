[1] "Tin is the most widely used modifier of platinum in catalysts for direct alkane dehydrogenation, leading to a system with higher selectivity to olefins and higher stability"

[2] "The most important tin effects on these catalysts are: (i) the strong inhibition of cracking due to a geometrical effect, and (ii) the decrease of the deactivation rate, either by a decrease of the coke formation rate or by a modification of the nature of the coke formed."

[3] "Surface Organometallic Chemistry on Metals (SOMC/M) procedures applied to the synthesis of bimetallic catalysts lead to stable and highly dispersed systems, as it has been reported in the literature"

The literature does not provide a comprehensive comparison between noble metal-based catalysts and metal oxide-based catalysts for light olefin dehydrogenation. However, it does offer some insights into platinum-based catalysts:

Platinum-tin (PtSn) catalysts are widely used for direct alkane dehydrogenation. The addition of tin to platinum improves selectivity towards olefins and increases catalyst stability. Tin helps inhibit cracking reactions and reduces catalyst deactivation by decreasing coke formation or altering the nature of coke deposits.

The preparation method significantly impacts catalyst performance. Surface Organometallic Chemistry on Metals (SOMC/M) techniques can produce stable and highly dispersed bimetallic catalysts.

The literature does not discuss metal oxide-based catalysts like CrOx, gallium, indium, vanadium, zinc, or molybdenum oxides. Therefore, a full comparison of compositions, effectiveness, industrial applications, recent developments, and potential advantages between noble metal and metal oxide catalysts cannot be made based on the given information.

该文献没有提供贵金属基催化剂和金属氧化物基催化剂在轻烯烃脱氢方面的全面比较。然而，它确实提供了一些关于铂基催化剂的见解：

铂-锡（PtSn）催化剂广泛用于直接烷烃脱氢。向铂中添加锡可以提高对烯烃的选择性并增加催化剂的稳定性。锡有助于抑制裂化反应，并通过减少积碳形成或改变积碳性质来降低催化剂失活。

制备方法对催化剂性能有显著影响。表面有机金属化学（SOMC/M）技术可以生产稳定和高度分散的双金属催化剂。

该文献没有讨论诸如CrOx、镓、铟、钒、锌或钼氧化物等金属氧化物基催化剂。因此，基于给定信息，无法对贵金属和金属氧化物催化剂的成分、有效性、工业应用、最新发展和潜在优势进行全面比较。
