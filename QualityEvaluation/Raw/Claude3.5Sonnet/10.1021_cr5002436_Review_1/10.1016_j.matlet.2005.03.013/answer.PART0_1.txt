[1] "Tin is the most widely used modifier of platinum in catalysts for direct alkane dehydrogenation, leading to a system with higher selectivity to olefins and higher stability"

[2] "The most important tin effects on these catalysts are: (i) the strong inhibition of cracking due to a geometrical effect, and (ii) the decrease of the deactivation rate, either by a decrease of the coke formation rate or by a modification of the nature of the coke formed."

[3] "Surface Organometallic Chemistry on Metals (SOMC/M) procedures applied to the synthesis of bimetallic catalysts lead to stable and highly dispersed systems, as it has been reported in the literature"

The literature provided focuses primarily on platinum-tin catalysts for isobutane dehydrogenation, rather than comparing noble metal-based and metal oxide-based catalysts for light olefin dehydrogenation. Therefore, a comprehensive comparison cannot be made based solely on this text. However, some insights can be drawn about platinum-based catalysts:

1. Composition: The catalysts discussed are PtSn/γ-Al2O3 systems, with tin acting as a modifier for platinum. Alkaline metals (Li, Na, K) are also added to modify the acidity of the alumina support.

2. Effectiveness: Platinum-tin catalysts show higher selectivity to olefins and improved stability compared to platinum alone. Tin helps inhibit cracking reactions and decreases the deactivation rate.

3. Preparation: Surface Organometallic Chemistry on Metals (SOMC/M) techniques are used to prepare these catalysts, resulting in stable and highly dispersed systems.

4. Support modification: The addition of alkaline metals to the alumina support helps neutralize acid sites, which can decrease the formation of undesired linear hydrocarbons.

The text does not provide information on metal oxide-based catalysts or recent developments in the field, so these aspects cannot be addressed based on the given literature.

提供的文献主要集中在铂-锡催化剂用于异丁烷脱氢反应，而不是比较贵金属基和金属氧化物基催化剂用于轻质烯烃脱氢。因此，仅基于这篇文献无法进行全面的比较。然而，我们可以从中获得一些关于铂基催化剂的见解：

1. 成分：讨论的催化剂是PtSn/γ-Al2O3系统，锡作为铂的改性剂。碱金属（Li、Na、K）也被添加以改变氧化铝载体的酸性。

2. 有效性：与单独使用铂相比，铂-锡催化剂表现出更高的烯烃选择性和改善的稳定性。锡有助于抑制裂化反应并降低失活速率。

3. 制备：使用金属表面有机金属化学（SOMC/M）技术制备这些催化剂，可以得到稳定和高度分散的体系。

4. 载体改性：向氧化铝载体添加碱金属有助于中和酸性位点，这可以减少不期望的直链烃的形成。

文本没有提供关于金属氧化物基催化剂或该领域最新发展的信息，因此无法根据给定的文献讨论这些方面。
