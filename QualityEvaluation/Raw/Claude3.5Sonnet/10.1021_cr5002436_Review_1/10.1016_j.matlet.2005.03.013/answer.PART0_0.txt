[1] "Tin is the most widely used modifier of platinum in catalysts for direct alkane dehydrogenation, leading to a system with higher selectivity to olefins and higher stability"

[2] "The most important tin effects on these catalysts are: (i) the strong inhibition of cracking due to a geometrical effect, and (ii) the decrease of the deactivation rate, either by a decrease of the coke formation rate or by a modification of the nature of the coke formed."

[3] "Surface Organometallic Chemistry on Metals (SOMC/M) procedures applied to the synthesis of bimetallic catalysts lead to stable and highly dispersed systems, as it has been reported in the literature"

The literature provided focuses primarily on platinum-tin catalysts for alkane dehydrogenation, particularly isobutane dehydrogenation. It does not contain information about metal oxide-based catalysts like CrOx, gallium, indium, vanadium, zinc, and molybdenum oxides.

For platinum-based catalysts:

Composition: The catalysts described are PtSn supported on γ-Al2O3, with some also containing alkaline metals (Li, Na, K) as modifiers.

Effectiveness: Tin is described as the most widely used modifier for platinum in alkane dehydrogenation catalysts. It increases selectivity to olefins and improves catalyst stability.

Industrial applications: These catalysts are used for direct alkane dehydrogenation, specifically mentioned for isobutane dehydrogenation.

Recent developments: The paper discusses the use of Surface Organometallic Chemistry on Metals (SOMC/M) techniques to synthesize bimetallic catalysts, resulting in stable and highly dispersed systems.

Potential advantages: PtSn catalysts show improved selectivity to olefins and higher stability compared to platinum alone. Tin helps inhibit cracking reactions and decreases the deactivation rate by reducing coke formation or modifying the nature of the coke formed.

The document does not provide information to compare these platinum-based catalysts with metal oxide-based catalysts for light olefin dehydrogenation.

所提供的文献主要关注铂-锡催化剂在烷烃脱氢反应中的应用，特别是异丁烷脱氢。它没有包含关于金属氧化物催化剂（如CrOx、镓、铟、钒、锌和钼氧化物）的信息。

对于铂基催化剂：

成分：所描述的催化剂是负载在γ-Al2O3上的PtSn，有些还含有碱金属（Li、Na、K）作为改性剂。

有效性：锡被描述为烷烃脱氢催化剂中最广泛使用的铂改性剂。它增加了对烯烃的选择性并提高了催化剂的稳定性。

工业应用：这些催化剂用于直接烷烃脱氢，特别提到用于异丁烷脱氢。

最新发展：该论文讨论了使用金属表面有机金属化学（SOMC/M）技术合成双金属催化剂，resulting in stable and highly dispersed systems。

潜在优势：与单独使用铂相比，PtSn催化剂显示出对烯烃的选择性提高和更高的稳定性。锡有助于抑制裂化反应，并通过减少焦炭形成或改变形成的焦炭性质来降低失活速率。

该文件没有提供将这些铂基催化剂与金属氧化物催化剂在轻质烯烃脱氢方面进行比较的信息。
