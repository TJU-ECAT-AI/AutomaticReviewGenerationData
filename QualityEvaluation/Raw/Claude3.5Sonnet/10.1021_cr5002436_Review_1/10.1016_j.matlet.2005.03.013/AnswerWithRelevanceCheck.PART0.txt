          [1] "Tin is the most widely used modifier of platinum in catalysts for direct alkane dehydrogenation, leading to a system with higher selectivity to olefins and higher stability"

          [2] "The most important tin effects on these catalysts are: (i) the strong inhibition of cracking due to a geometrical effect, and (ii) the decrease of the deactivation rate, either by a decrease of the coke formation rate or by a modification of the nature of the coke formed."

          [3] "Surface Organometallic Chemistry on Metals (SOMC/M) procedures applied to the synthesis of bimetallic catalysts lead to stable and highly dispersed systems, as it has been reported in the literature"

          [4] "Bimetallic PtSn/g-Al2O3 catalysts were prepared by employing SOMC/M techniques"

          The provided literature focuses primarily on platinum-tin (PtSn) catalysts for alkane dehydrogenation, particularly isobutane dehydrogenation. It does not contain comprehensive information about metal oxide-based catalysts like CrOx, gallium, indium, vanadium, zinc, and molybdenum oxides, making a full comparison impossible.

          For platinum-based catalysts:

          Composition: The catalysts discussed are PtSn supported on γ-Al2O3, with some also containing alkaline metals (Li, Na, K) as modifiers.

          Effectiveness: Tin is described as the most widely used modifier for platinum in alkane dehydrogenation catalysts. It increases selectivity to olefins and improves catalyst stability. PtSn catalysts show higher selectivity to olefins and improved stability compared to platinum alone.

          Preparation: Surface Organometallic Chemistry on Metals (SOMC/M) techniques are used to prepare these catalysts, resulting in stable and highly dispersed bimetallic systems.

          Advantages: Tin helps inhibit cracking reactions and decreases the deactivation rate by reducing coke formation or modifying the nature of the coke formed. The addition of alkaline metals to the alumina support helps neutralize acid sites, which can decrease the formation of undesired linear hydrocarbons.

          The document does not provide information to compare these platinum-based catalysts with metal oxide-based catalysts for light olefin dehydrogenation, nor does it discuss their relative industrial applications or recent developments in the field. A more comprehensive comparison would require additional sources.

          提供的文献主要关注铂-锡（PtSn）催化剂在烷烃脱氢反应中的应用，特别是异丁烷脱氢。它没有包含关于金属氧化物催化剂（如CrOx、镓、铟、钒、锌和钼氧化物）的全面信息，因此无法进行完整的比较。

          对于铂基催化剂：

          成分：所讨论的催化剂是负载在γ-Al2O3上的PtSn，有些还含有碱金属（Li、Na、K）作为改性剂。

          有效性：锡被描述为烷烃脱氢催化剂中最广泛使用的铂改性剂。它增加了对烯烃的选择性并提高了催化剂的稳定性。与单独使用铂相比，PtSn催化剂显示出对烯烃的选择性提高和更高的稳定性。

          制备：使用金属表面有机金属化学（SOMC/M）技术制备这些催化剂，可以得到稳定和高度分散的双金属体系。

          优势：锡有助于抑制裂化反应，并通过减少焦炭形成或改变形成的焦炭性质来降低失活速率。向氧化铝载体添加碱金属有助于中和酸性位点，这可以减少不期望的直链烃的形成。

          该文件没有提供将这些铂基催化剂与金属氧化物催化剂在轻质烯烃脱氢方面进行比较的信息，也没有讨论它们的相对工业应用或该领域的最新发展。更全面的比较需要额外的资料来源。
