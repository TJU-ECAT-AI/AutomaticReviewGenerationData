[1] "Tin is the most widely used modifier of platinum in catalysts for direct alkane dehydrogenation, leading to a system with higher selectivity to olefins and higher stability"

[2] "The most important tin effects on these catalysts are: (i) the strong inhibition of cracking due to a geometrical effect, and (ii) the decrease of the deactivation rate, either by a decrease of the coke formation rate or by a modification of the nature of the coke formed."

[3] "Surface Organometallic Chemistry on Metals (SOMC/M) procedures applied to the synthesis of bimetallic catalysts lead to stable and highly dispersed systems, as it has been reported in the literature"

The literature provided focuses primarily on platinum-tin (PtSn) catalysts for isobutane dehydrogenation, with some discussion of alkaline metal additives. It does not contain information about metal oxide-based catalysts like CrOx, gallium, indium, vanadium, zinc, and molybdenum oxides.

For platinum-based catalysts:

Composition: The catalysts described are PtSn supported on γ-Al2O3, with alkaline metals (Li, Na, K) added as modifiers.

Effectiveness: PtSn catalysts show higher selectivity to olefins and improved stability compared to platinum alone. Tin helps inhibit cracking reactions and reduces deactivation rates.

Preparation: Surface Organometallic Chemistry on Metals (SOMC/M) techniques are used to create stable, highly dispersed bimetallic catalysts.

The document does not provide information to compare these platinum-based catalysts with metal oxide catalysts or discuss their relative industrial applications, recent developments, or potential advantages.

提供的文献主要关注用于异丁烷脱氢的铂-锡(PtSn)催化剂,并讨论了碱金属添加剂。它不包含有关CrOx、镓、铟、钒、锌和钼氧化物等金属氧化物基催化剂的信息。

对于铂基催化剂:

成分:描述的催化剂是负载在γ-Al2O3上的PtSn,添加碱金属(Li、Na、K)作为改性剂。

有效性:与单独使用铂相比,PtSn催化剂表现出更高的烯烃选择性和更好的稳定性。锡有助于抑制裂化反应并降低失活速率。

制备:使用金属表面有机金属化学(SOMC/M)技术来制备稳定、高分散的双金属催化剂。

该文件没有提供比较这些铂基催化剂与金属氧化物催化剂的信息,也没有讨论它们的相对工业应用、最新发展或潜在优势。
