[1] "Tin is the most widely used modifier of platinum in catalysts for direct alkane dehydrogenation, leading to a system with higher selectivity to olefins and higher stability"

[2] "The most important tin effects on these catalysts are: (i) the strong inhibition of cracking due to a geometrical effect, and (ii) the decrease of the deactivation rate, either by a decrease of the coke formation rate or by a modification of the nature of the coke formed."

[3] "Surface Organometallic Chemistry on Metals (SOMC/M) procedures applied to the synthesis of bimetallic catalysts lead to stable and highly dispersed systems, as it has been reported in the literature"

The literature provided does not contain sufficient information to fully compare and contrast noble metal-based catalysts and metal oxide-based catalysts for light olefin dehydrogenation. The text focuses primarily on platinum-tin catalysts supported on alumina, with some discussion of alkali metal modifiers.

Based on the limited information available:

1. Composition: The main catalyst discussed is PtSn supported on gamma-alumina (PtSn/γ-Al2O3). Alkaline metals (Li, Na, K) are also studied as modifiers.

2. Effectiveness: Tin is described as the most widely used modifier for platinum in alkane dehydrogenation catalysts, improving selectivity to olefins and stability. The addition of alkali metals, particularly potassium, is reported to improve catalyst stability.

3. Preparation: Surface Organometallic Chemistry on Metals (SOMC/M) techniques are used to prepare the bimetallic PtSn catalysts, resulting in stable and highly dispersed systems.

4. Advantages: PtSn catalysts show higher selectivity to olefins and improved stability compared to platinum alone. Tin inhibits cracking reactions and decreases the deactivation rate by reducing coke formation or modifying the nature of the coke formed.

The document does not provide information on metal oxide-based catalysts (CrOx, gallium, indium, vanadium, zinc, and molybdenum oxides) or recent developments in the field. A more comprehensive comparison would require additional sources.

提供的文献没有足够的信息来全面比较和对比用于轻质烯烃脱氢的贵金属基催化剂和金属氧化物基催化剂。文本主要关注铂-锡催化剂在氧化铝上的负载,并对碱金属改性剂进行了一些讨论。

基于有限的可用信息:

1. 成分:主要讨论的催化剂是负载在γ-氧化铝上的PtSn(PtSn/γ-Al2O3)。碱金属(Li、Na、K)也被研究作为改性剂。

2. 有效性:锡被描述为烷烃脱氢催化剂中铂的最广泛使用的改性剂,提高了对烯烃的选择性和稳定性。添加碱金属,特别是钾,据报道可以提高催化剂的稳定性。

3. 制备:使用金属表面有机金属化学(SOMC/M)技术制备双金属PtSn催化剂,得到稳定且高度分散的体系。

4. 优势:与单独的铂相比,PtSn催化剂表现出更高的烯烃选择性和改善的稳定性。锡抑制裂化反应,并通过减少焦炭形成或改变焦炭性质来降低失活率。

该文件没有提供有关金属氧化物基催化剂(CrOx、镓、铟、钒、锌和钼氧化物)或该领域最新发展的信息。更全面的比较需要额外的资料来源。
