          [1] "Catalytic dehydrogenation processes are of increasing importance because of growing demand for light olefins such as propylene and isobutene. Supported platinum is a good catalyst for reforming and dehydrogenation reactions."

[2] "Addition of Sn to Pt/Al2O3 naphtha-reforming catalysts is well known to promote desired dehydrogenation reactions and inhibit coking reactions"

[3] "Addition of Zn to Pt-based catalysts can lead to an obvious change of catalytic performance. For example, the addition of Zn to Pt/Al2O3 catalysts can promote the selective reduction of NO and improve the resistance of these systems in waste gas treatment processes."

[4] "Over Pt/ZnO catalysts high hydrogenation and dehydrogenation selectivity could be obtained"

[5] "A great improvement in dehydrogenation selectivity is obtained over both zinc-doped Pt and PtSn catalysts."

          The literature primarily focuses on noble metal-based catalysts, particularly platinum, for the nonoxidative dehydrogenation of light olefins. It does not provide direct comparisons with metal oxide-based catalysts like CrOx, gallium, indium, vanadium, zinc, and molybdenum oxides.

Composition: The catalysts discussed are primarily platinum-based, often supported on alumina (Pt/Al2O3). Tin (Sn) and zinc (Zn) are mentioned as important additives or promoters. The optimal catalyst contained 0.3 wt% Pt, 0.9 wt% Sn, and 0.5 wt% Zn.

Effectiveness: Platinum-based catalysts show good performance in dehydrogenation reactions. The addition of Sn to Pt/Al2O3 catalysts promotes desired dehydrogenation reactions and inhibits coking. Zinc-doped Pt and PtSn catalysts show great improvement in dehydrogenation selectivity, with propylene selectivity up to 98-99% and good stability. The best catalyst (ZnSnPt/Al) exhibited only 5% deactivation.

Industrial applications: These catalysts are used in catalytic dehydrogenation processes for producing light olefins such as propylene and isobutene. They are also used in naphtha-reforming.

Recent developments: The research focuses on improving platinum-based catalysts by adding promoters like Sn and Zn. Zinc-doped catalysts show promising results in terms of improved selectivity and resistance to deactivation. The addition of zinc to PtSn catalysts was found to improve performance by increasing Pt dispersion, modifying electronic properties, and reducing coke formation.

Potential advantages: Pt-based catalysts, especially when doped with Sn or Zn, show high selectivity for dehydrogenation reactions and improved resistance to coking and deactivation. Pt/ZnO catalysts demonstrate high hydrogenation and dehydrogenation selectivity. The ability to fine-tune performance through promoters like Zn allows for optimization.

Platinum catalysts operate through a metallic active phase, where the electronic and geometric properties of the platinum particles are crucial for performance. The preparation method, particularly the sequence of adding different metals, strongly influences catalyst performance.

The document does not provide information on metal oxide-based catalysts like CrOx, gallium, indium, vanadium, and molybdenum oxides for comparison. To properly compare these platinum catalysts with metal oxide catalysts would require additional information not present in this document.

          该文献主要关注贵金属基催化剂，特别是铂，用于轻烯烃的非氧化脱氢。它没有直接与金属氧化物基催化剂（如CrOx、镓、铟、钒、锌和钼氧化物）进行比较。

成分：讨论的催化剂主要是铂基的，通常以氧化铝为载体（Pt/Al2O3）。锡（Sn）和锌（Zn）被提及为重要的添加剂或助剂。最佳催化剂含有0.3 wt%的Pt、0.9 wt%的Sn和0.5 wt%的Zn。

有效性：铂基催化剂在脱氢反应中表现出良好的性能。向Pt/Al2O3催化剂中添加Sn可促进所需的脱氢反应并抑制结焦。锌掺杂的Pt和PtSn催化剂在脱氢选择性方面显示出很大的改进，丙烯选择性高达98-99%，并具有良好的稳定性。最佳催化剂（ZnSnPt/Al）仅表现出5%的失活。

工业应用：这些催化剂用于催化脱氢过程，生产如丙烯和异丁烯等轻烯烃。它们也用于石脑油重整。

最新发展：研究重点是通过添加Sn和Zn等助剂来改进铂基催化剂。锌掺杂的催化剂在提高选择性和抗失活性方面显示出有前景的结果。向PtSn催化剂中添加锌被发现可以通过增加Pt分散度、修改电子性质和减少积碳来提高性能。

潜在优势：铂基催化剂，尤其是掺杂Sn或Zn时，表现出对脱氢反应的高选择性，以及对结焦和失活的改进抗性。Pt/ZnO催化剂表现出高的氢化和脱氢选择性。通过锌等助剂微调性能的能力允许进行优化。

铂催化剂通过金属活性相运作，其中铂颗粒的电子和几何性质对性能至关重要。制备方法，特别是添加不同金属的顺序，强烈影响催化剂性能。

该文档没有提供CrOx、镓、铟、钒和钼氧化物等金属氧化物基催化剂的信息以供比较。要正确比较这些铂催化剂与金属氧化物催化剂，需要本文档中未提供的额外信息。
