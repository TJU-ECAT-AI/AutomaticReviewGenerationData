The given literature does not contain information to directly compare and contrast noble metal-based catalysts like platinum with metal oxide-based catalysts for light olefin dehydrogenation. The document focuses specifically on zinc-doped platinum and platinum-tin catalysts for propane dehydrogenation, without discussing other metal oxide catalysts like chromium, gallium, indium, vanadium or molybdenum oxides. Therefore, this question cannot be fully answered based solely on the information provided in this literature.

However, we can extract some relevant information about platinum-based catalysts from the document:

1. Platinum-based catalysts, particularly Pt/Al2O3, PtSn/Al2O3, and zinc-doped versions, are effective for propane dehydrogenation to produce propylene.

2. The addition of zinc to Pt and PtSn catalysts improves selectivity towards propylene and catalyst stability.

3. Zinc-doped PtSn catalysts show high activity, selectivity, and stability in propane dehydrogenation. The best performance was obtained with 0.5% Zn content.

4. The improved performance of Zn-doped Pt catalysts is attributed to increased Pt dispersion, changes in electronic properties of Pt, and reduced coke formation.

5. The preparation method, particularly the sequence of metal deposition, strongly influences the catalyst performance.

6. These catalysts operate at high temperatures (around 576°C) for propane dehydrogenation.

To fully answer the question and compare with other metal oxide catalysts would require additional information not present in this document.

给定的文献没有直接比较和对比贵金属基催化剂(如铂)与金属氧化物基催化剂在轻烯烃脱氢方面的信息。该文档专门关注锌掺杂的铂和铂-锡催化剂用于丙烷脱氢,没有讨论其他金属氧化物催化剂,如铬、镓、铟、钒或钼的氧化物。因此,仅基于本文献提供的信息无法全面回答这个问题。

然而,我们可以从文档中提取一些关于铂基催化剂的相关信息:

1. 铂基催化剂,特别是Pt/Al2O3、PtSn/Al2O3及其锌掺杂版本,对丙烷脱氢生产丙烯很有效。

2. 向Pt和PtSn催化剂中添加锌可以提高对丙烯的选择性和催化剂的稳定性。

3. 锌掺杂的PtSn催化剂在丙烷脱氢中表现出高活性、高选择性和高稳定性。0.5%的锌含量获得了最佳性能。

4. Zn掺杂Pt催化剂性能改善归因于Pt分散度增加、Pt电子性质改变以及积碳形成减少。

5. 制备方法,特别是金属沉积顺序,强烈影响催化剂性能。

6. 这些催化剂在高温(约576°C)下进行丙烷脱氢。

要全面回答问题并与其他金属氧化物催化剂进行比较,需要本文档中未提供的额外信息。

The literature primarily focuses on noble metal-based catalysts, particularly platinum, for the nonoxidative dehydrogenation of light olefins. It does not provide direct comparisons with metal oxide-based catalysts like CrOx, gallium, indium, vanadium, zinc, and molybdenum oxides.

Composition: The catalysts discussed are primarily platinum-based, often supported on alumina (Pt/Al2O3). Tin (Sn) and zinc (Zn) are mentioned as important additives or promoters.

Effectiveness: Platinum-based catalysts show good performance in dehydrogenation reactions. The addition of Sn to Pt/Al2O3 catalysts promotes desired dehydrogenation reactions and inhibits coking. Zinc-doped Pt and PtSn catalysts show great improvement in dehydrogenation selectivity.

Industrial applications: These catalysts are used in catalytic dehydrogenation processes for producing light olefins such as propylene and isobutene. They are also used in naphtha-reforming.

Recent developments: The research focuses on improving platinum-based catalysts by adding promoters like Sn and Zn. Zinc-doped catalysts show promising results in terms of improved selectivity and resistance to deactivation.

Potential advantages: Pt-based catalysts, especially when doped with Sn or Zn, show high selectivity for dehydrogenation reactions and improved resistance to coking and deactivation. Pt/ZnO catalysts demonstrate high hydrogenation and dehydrogenation selectivity.

The document does not provide information on metal oxide-based catalysts like CrOx, gallium, indium, vanadium, and molybdenum oxides for comparison.

The given literature does not contain information to directly compare noble metal-based catalysts like platinum with metal oxide-based catalysts for light olefin dehydrogenation. The document focuses specifically on platinum-based catalysts, particularly those doped with zinc and tin, for propane dehydrogenation. It does not discuss metal oxide catalysts like chromium, gallium, indium, vanadium or molybdenum oxides.

However, based on the information provided about platinum catalysts, we can infer some key points:

1. Platinum-based catalysts, especially when promoted with elements like tin and zinc, can achieve high selectivity (up to 97-99%) for propylene in propane dehydrogenation.

2. The addition of promoters like zinc can improve catalyst stability and reduce deactivation.

3. Platinum catalysts operate through a metallic active phase, where the electronic and geometric properties of the platinum particles are crucial for performance.

4. Coke formation is a major challenge for platinum catalysts, but can be mitigated through proper promoter addition and tuning of acidity.

5. The preparation method, particularly the sequence of adding different metals, strongly influences catalyst performance.

To properly compare these platinum catalysts with metal oxide catalysts would require additional information not present in this document. Metal oxide catalysts generally operate through different mechanisms, often involving redox cycles, and may have different advantages in terms of cost or stability. However, the document does not provide data to make these comparisons directly.

4. 结焦是铂催化剂的一个主要挑战，但可以通过适当的助剂添加和酸度调节来缓解。

5. 制备方法，特别是添加不同金属的顺序，强烈影响催化剂性能。

要正确比较这些铂催化剂与金属氧化物催化剂，需要本文档中未提供的额外信息。金属氧化物催化剂通常通过不同的机制运作，often常涉及氧化还原循环，在成本或稳定性方面可能有不同的优势。然而，该文档没有提供直接进行这些比较的数据。

However, based on the information provided about platinum catalysts, we can infer some points:

1. Composition: The study examines platinum catalysts supported on alumina, with tin and zinc as promoters. The optimal catalyst contained 0.3 wt% Pt, 0.9 wt% Sn, and 0.5 wt% Zn.

2. Effectiveness: The zinc-doped PtSn catalysts showed high propylene selectivity (up to 98-99%) and good stability. The best catalyst (ZnSnPt/Al) exhibited only 5% deactivation.

3. Recent developments: The addition of zinc to PtSn catalysts was found to improve performance by increasing Pt dispersion, modifying electronic properties, and reducing coke formation.

4. Potential advantages: Platinum-based catalysts offer high selectivity and stability. The ability to fine-tune performance through promoters like Zn allows for optimization.

The literature does not provide information to compare these attributes to metal oxide catalysts or discuss their relative industrial applications. A comprehensive comparison would require additional sources focused on metal oxide catalysts for dehydrogenation.
