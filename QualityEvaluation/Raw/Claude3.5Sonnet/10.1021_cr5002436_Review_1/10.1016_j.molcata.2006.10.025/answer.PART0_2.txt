The literature primarily focuses on noble metal-based catalysts, particularly platinum, for the nonoxidative dehydrogenation of light olefins. It does not provide direct comparisons with metal oxide-based catalysts like CrOx, gallium, indium, vanadium, zinc, and molybdenum oxides.

Composition: The catalysts discussed are primarily platinum-based, often supported on alumina (Pt/Al2O3). Tin (Sn) and zinc (Zn) are mentioned as important additives or promoters.

Effectiveness: Platinum-based catalysts show good performance in dehydrogenation reactions. The addition of Sn to Pt/Al2O3 catalysts promotes desired dehydrogenation reactions and inhibits coking. Zinc-doped Pt and PtSn catalysts show great improvement in dehydrogenation selectivity.

Industrial applications: These catalysts are used in catalytic dehydrogenation processes for producing light olefins such as propylene and isobutene. They are also used in naphtha-reforming.

Recent developments: The research focuses on improving platinum-based catalysts by adding promoters like Sn and Zn. Zinc-doped catalysts show promising results in terms of improved selectivity and resistance to deactivation.

Potential advantages: Pt-based catalysts, especially when doped with Sn or Zn, show high selectivity for dehydrogenation reactions and improved resistance to coking and deactivation. Pt/ZnO catalysts demonstrate high hydrogenation and dehydrogenation selectivity.

The document does not provide information on metal oxide-based catalysts like CrOx, gallium, indium, vanadium, and molybdenum oxides for comparison.

该文献主要关注贵金属基催化剂，特别是铂，用于轻烯烃的非氧化脱氢。它没有直接与金属氧化物基催化剂（如CrOx、镓、铟、钒、锌和钼氧化物）进行比较。

成分：讨论的催化剂主要是铂基的，通常以氧化铝为载体（Pt/Al2O3）。锡（Sn）和锌（Zn）被提及为重要的添加剂或助剂。

有效性：铂基催化剂在脱氢反应中表现出良好的性能。向Pt/Al2O3催化剂中添加Sn可促进所需的脱氢反应并抑制结焦。锌掺杂的Pt和PtSn催化剂在脱氢选择性方面显示出很大的改进。

工业应用：这些催化剂用于催化脱氢过程，生产如丙烯和异丁烯等轻烯烃。它们也用于石脑油重整。

最新发展：研究重点是通过添加Sn和Zn等助剂来改进铂基催化剂。锌掺杂的催化剂在提高选择性和抗失活性方面显示出有前景的结果。

潜在优势：铂基催化剂，尤其是掺杂Sn或Zn时，表现出对脱氢反应的高选择性，以及对结焦和失活的改进抗性。Pt/ZnO催化剂表现出高的氢化和脱氢选择性。

该文档没有提供CrOx、镓、铟、钒和钼氧化物等金属氧化物基催化剂的信息以供比较。
