<quotes>

[1] "The UOP Oleflex process [26] uses three or four radial-flow moving-bed reactors, packed with a supported Pt catalyst, in series with interstage heaters, similar to the UOP continuous regenerative reforming process [21,22]. In the regeneration unit the coke is burned off the catalyst, the platinum is redispersed, and excess moisture is removed. The cycle time through the unit is between 2 and 7 days."

[2] "A key feature of the Lummus Catofin process [27] is the principle of storing the needed reaction heat in the catalyst bed. A supported chromium oxide catalyst is used in this process. Reactors (usually three to eight in parallel) are alternately on stream for reaction and off stream for regeneration by coke burn-off."

[3] "The catalyst used for dehydrogenation is a supported platinum catalyst promoted with tin. Carbon burn-off is required every 8 h [21]."

[4] "The SnamprogettiYarsintez FBD-4 design [25] is similar to older FCC units with continuous catalyst circulation between a fluidised-bed reactor and regenerator on a 3060 min cycle [28]. Catalyst returning from the regenerator, where coke is burned off, to the reactor supplies the reaction heat. The catalyst used is a promoted chromium oxide powder with high attrition resistance."

The literature provides limited information to fully compare and contrast noble metal-based catalysts and metal oxide-based catalysts for light olefin dehydrogenation. However, some key points can be extracted:

1. Composition: 
- Noble metal catalysts: Platinum-based, often supported and sometimes promoted with other elements like tin.
- Metal oxide catalysts: Chromium oxide-based, supported or in powder form.

2. Industrial applications:
- Platinum catalysts: Used in the UOP Oleflex process and Phillips STAR process.
- Chromium oxide catalysts: Used in the Lummus Catofin process and SnamprogettiYarsintez FBD-4 design.

3. Effectiveness and regeneration:
- Both types of catalysts require frequent regeneration due to coke formation.
- Platinum catalysts: Regeneration cycle varies from 8 hours (STAR process) to 2-7 days (Oleflex process).
- Chromium oxide catalysts: Regeneration cycle ranges from 15-30 minutes (Catofin) to 30-60 minutes (FBD-4).

4. Process design:
- Platinum catalysts are often used in moving-bed reactors or swing reactors.
- Chromium oxide catalysts are used in both swing reactors and fluidized bed systems.

The literature does not provide information on recent developments or potential advantages of these catalysts. Additionally, there is no mention of gallium, indium, vanadium, zinc, or molybdenum oxide catalysts for this application.
