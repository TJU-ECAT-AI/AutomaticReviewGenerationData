          [1] "The UOP Oleflex process [26] uses three or four radial-flow moving-bed reactors, packed with a supported Pt catalyst, in series with interstage heaters, similar to the UOP continuous regenerative reforming process [21,22]."

[2] "A key feature of the Lummus Catofin process [27] is the principle of storing the needed reaction heat in the catalyst bed. A supported chromium oxide catalyst is used in this process."

[3] "The catalyst used for dehydrogenation is a supported platinum catalyst promoted with tin."

[4] "The catalyst used is a promoted chromium oxide powder with high attrition resistance."

[5] "The UOP Oleflex process [26] uses three or four radial-flow moving-bed reactors, packed with a supported Pt catalyst, in series with interstage heaters, similar to the UOP continuous regenerative reforming process [21,22]. In the regeneration unit the coke is burned off the catalyst, the platinum is redispersed, and excess moisture is removed. The cycle time through the unit is between 2 and 7 days."

[6] "The SnamprogettiYarsintez FBD-4 design [25] is similar to older FCC units with continuous catalyst circulation between a fluidised-bed reactor and regenerator on a 3060 min cycle [28]. Catalyst returning from the regenerator, where coke is burned off, to the reactor supplies the reaction heat. The catalyst used is a promoted chromium oxide powder with high attrition resistance."

          The literature provides limited information to fully compare and contrast noble metal-based catalysts and metal oxide-based catalysts for light olefin dehydrogenation. However, some key points can be extracted:

1. Compositions:
   - Noble metal catalysts: Supported platinum catalysts are mentioned, sometimes promoted with tin.
   - Metal oxide catalysts: Supported chromium oxide catalysts are discussed, including promoted chromium oxide powder.

2. Industrial applications and process designs:
   - UOP Oleflex process: Uses supported Pt catalysts in radial-flow moving-bed reactors.
   - Lummus Catofin process: Uses supported chromium oxide catalysts, utilizing the principle of storing reaction heat in the catalyst bed.
   - Phillips STAR process: Uses supported platinum catalysts promoted with tin.
   - SnamprogettiYarsintez FBD-4 process: Uses promoted chromium oxide powder in a fluidized-bed reactor design.

3. Regeneration:
   - Both types of catalysts require periodic regeneration due to coke formation.
   - UOP Oleflex: Regeneration cycle is between 2 and 7 days.
   - SnamprogettiYarsintez FBD-4: Regeneration occurs on a 30-60 minute cycle.

4. Potential advantages:
   - For chromium oxide catalysts, high attrition resistance is mentioned as an advantage for use in fluidized bed reactors.
   - For platinum catalysts, no specific advantages are noted in the provided information.

The literature does not provide sufficient information to compare the effectiveness, recent developments, or comprehensive potential advantages of these catalyst types for light olefin dehydrogenation. Additionally, there is no mention of gallium, indium, vanadium, zinc, or molybdenum oxide catalysts for this application.

          文献提供的信息有限，无法全面比较和对比用于轻质烯烃脱氢的贵金属基催化剂和金属氧化物基催化剂。但是，可以提取一些关键点：

1. 成分：
   - 贵金属催化剂：提到了负载型铂催化剂，有时用锡进行促进。
   - 金属氧化物催化剂：讨论了负载型铬氧化物催化剂，包括促进的铬氧化物粉末。

2. 工业应用和工艺设计：
   - UOP Oleflex工艺：在径向流动床反应器中使用负载型铂催化剂。
   - Lummus Catofin工艺：使用负载型铬氧化物催化剂，利用在催化剂床中储存反应热的原理。
   - Phillips STAR工艺：使用锡促进的负载型铂催化剂。
   - SnamprogettiYarsintez FBD-4工艺：在流化床反应器设计中使用促进的铬氧化物粉末。

3. 再生：
   - 两种类型的催化剂都因积碳而需要定期再生。
   - UOP Oleflex：再生周期为2到7天。
   - SnamprogettiYarsintez FBD-4：再生在30-60分钟的周期内进行。

4. 潜在优势：
   - 对于铬氧化物催化剂，高耐磨性被提及为在流化床反应器中使用的一个优势。
   - 对于铂催化剂，在所提供的信息中没有提到具体的优势。

文献没有提供足够的信息来比较这些催化剂类型在轻质烯烃脱氢方面的有效性、最新发展或全面的潜在优势。此外，也没有提到镓、铟、钒、锌或钼氧化物催化剂在这一应用中的使用。
