[1] "The UOP Oleflex process [26] uses three or four radial-flow moving-bed reactors, packed with a supported Pt catalyst, in series with interstage heaters, similar to the UOP continuous regenerative reforming process [21,22]."

[2] "A key feature of the Lummus Catofin process [27] is the principle of storing the needed reaction heat in the catalyst bed. A supported chromium oxide catalyst is used in this process."

[3] "The catalyst used for dehydrogenation is a supported platinum catalyst promoted with tin."

[4] "The catalyst used is a promoted chromium oxide powder with high attrition resistance."

The literature provides limited information to fully compare and contrast noble metal-based catalysts and metal oxide-based catalysts for light olefin dehydrogenation. However, some key points can be extracted:

1. Composition: Noble metal catalysts mentioned include supported platinum and platinum promoted with tin. Metal oxide catalysts mentioned are chromium oxide-based.

2. Industrial applications: Both types of catalysts are used in commercial alkane dehydrogenation processes. The UOP Oleflex process uses a platinum catalyst, while the Lummus Catofin process uses a chromium oxide catalyst. 

3. Effectiveness: The literature does not provide direct comparisons of effectiveness between the two catalyst types.

4. Recent developments: The text does not discuss recent developments for either catalyst type.

5. Potential advantages: For chromium oxide catalysts, high attrition resistance is mentioned as an advantage for use in fluidized bed reactors. For platinum catalysts, no specific advantages are noted.

6. Regeneration: Both catalyst types require periodic regeneration due to coke formation, though the frequency varies between processes.

The literature does not provide information on gallium, indium, vanadium, zinc, or molybdenum oxide catalysts for this application. A more comprehensive comparison would require additional sources.

该文献提供的信息有限,无法全面比较和对比用于轻质烯烃脱氢的贵金属基催化剂和金属氧化物基催化剂。但是可以提取一些要点:

1. 成分:提到的贵金属催化剂包括负载型铂和用锡促进的铂。提到的金属氧化物催化剂是基于氧化铬的。

2. 工业应用:这两种类型的催化剂都用于商业烷烃脱氢工艺。UOP Oleflex工艺使用铂催化剂,而Lummus Catofin工艺使用氧化铬催化剂。

3. 有效性:文献没有直接比较这两种催化剂类型的有效性。

4. 最新发展:文本没有讨论任何一种催化剂类型的最新发展。

5. 潜在优势:对于氧化铬催化剂,提到高抗磨损性是在流化床反应器中使用的一个优势。对于铂催化剂,没有提到具体的优势。

6. 再生:由于积碳,两种催化剂类型都需要定期再生,尽管不同工艺的频率不同。

文献没有提供关于镓、铟、钒、锌或钼氧化物催化剂在这一应用中的信息。更全面的比较需要额外的信息来源。
