[1] "The UOP Oleflex process [26] uses three or four radial-flow moving-bed reactors, packed with a supported Pt catalyst, in series with interstage heaters, similar to the UOP continuous regenerative reforming process [21,22]."

[2] "A key feature of the Lummus Catofin process [27] is the principle of storing the needed reaction heat in the catalyst bed. A supported chromium oxide catalyst is used in this process."

[3] "The catalyst used for dehydrogenation is a supported platinum catalyst promoted with tin."

[4] "The catalyst used is a promoted chromium oxide powder with high attrition resistance."

The literature provides limited information to fully compare and contrast noble metal-based and metal oxide-based catalysts for light olefin dehydrogenation. However, some key points can be extracted:

1. Noble metal-based catalysts:
- Platinum is commonly used, often supported and sometimes promoted with tin
- Used in processes like UOP Oleflex and Phillips STAR
- Employed in moving-bed and swing reactor configurations

2. Metal oxide-based catalysts:
- Chromium oxide is mentioned, used in supported form or as a promoted powder
- Used in processes like Lummus Catofin and Snamprogretti-Yarsintez FBD-4
- Employed in swing reactor and fluidized bed configurations

The literature does not provide detailed information on effectiveness, recent developments, or potential advantages of these catalyst types. It also does not mention other metal oxides like gallium, indium, vanadium, zinc, or molybdenum oxides in the context of light olefin dehydrogenation.

To fully answer the question, more comprehensive information on catalyst compositions, performance metrics, and recent research would be needed.

该文献提供的信息有限，无法全面比较和对比用于轻质烯烃脱氢的贵金属基和金属氧化物基催化剂。但是，可以提取一些要点：

1. 贵金属基催化剂：
- 常用铂，通常是负载型，有时用锡促进
- 用于UOP Oleflex和Phillips STAR等工艺
- 在移动床和摆动反应器配置中使用

2. 金属氧化物基催化剂：
- 提到了氧化铬，以负载形式或作为促进的粉末使用
- 用于Lummus Catofin和Snamprogretti-Yarsintez FBD-4等工艺
- 在摆动反应器和流化床配置中使用

文献没有提供关于这些催化剂类型的有效性、最新发展或潜在优势的详细信息。它也没有在轻质烯烃脱氢的背景下提到其他金属氧化物，如镓、铟、钒、锌或钼的氧化物。

要全面回答这个问题，需要更多关于催化剂成分、性能指标和最新研究的综合信息。
