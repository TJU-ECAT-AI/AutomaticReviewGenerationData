[1] "The UOP Oleflex process [26] uses three or four radial-flow moving-bed reactors, packed with a supported Pt catalyst, in series with interstage heaters, similar to the UOP continuous regenerative reforming process [21,22]."

[2] "A key feature of the Lummus Catofin process [27] is the principle of storing the needed reaction heat in the catalyst bed. A supported chromium oxide catalyst is used in this process."

[3] "The catalyst used for dehydrogenation is a supported platinum catalyst promoted with tin."

[4] "The catalyst used is a promoted chromium oxide powder with high attrition resistance."

The literature provides limited information to fully compare and contrast noble metal-based and metal oxide-based catalysts for light olefin dehydrogenation. However, based on the available information:

1. Composition: Noble metal catalysts mentioned include supported platinum and platinum promoted with tin. Metal oxide catalysts mentioned include supported chromium oxide and promoted chromium oxide powder.

2. Industrial applications: 
- UOP Oleflex process uses supported Pt catalysts in radial-flow moving-bed reactors.
- Lummus Catofin process uses supported chromium oxide catalysts in swing reactors.
- Phillips STAR process uses supported platinum catalysts promoted with tin in tubular reactors.
- SnamprogettiYarsintez FBD-4 process uses promoted chromium oxide powder in fluidized bed reactors.

3. Regeneration: Both types of catalysts require frequent regeneration due to coke formation. The regeneration cycles vary from minutes to days depending on the process.

4. Attrition resistance: The chromium oxide powder catalyst used in the fluidized bed process is noted to have high attrition resistance.

The literature does not provide sufficient information to compare the effectiveness, recent developments, or potential advantages of these catalyst types for light olefin dehydrogenation.

文献提供的信息有限，无法全面比较和对比用于轻烯烃脱氢的贵金属基和金属氧化物基催化剂。但根据可用信息：

1. 成分：提到的贵金属催化剂包括负载铂和锡促进的铂。提到的金属氧化物催化剂包括负载的铬氧化物和促进的铬氧化物粉末。

2. 工业应用：
- UOP Oleflex工艺在径向流动床反应器中使用负载铂催化剂。
- Lummus Catofin工艺在摆动反应器中使用负载铬氧化物催化剂。
- Phillips STAR工艺在管式反应器中使用锡促进的负载铂催化剂。
- SnamprogettiYarsintez FBD-4工艺在流化床反应器中使用促进的铬氧化物粉末。

3. 再生：由于积碳，两种类型的催化剂都需要频繁再生。再生周期根据工艺不同从分钟到天不等。

4. 耐磨性：用于流化床工艺的铬氧化物粉末催化剂被注明具有高耐磨性。

文献没有提供足够的信息来比较这些催化剂类型在轻烯烃脱氢方面的有效性、最新发展或潜在优势。
