[1] "The UOP Oleflex process [26] uses three or four radial-flow moving-bed reactors, packed with a supported Pt catalyst, in series with interstage heaters, similar to the UOP continuous regenerative reforming process [21,22]."

[2] "A key feature of the Lummus Catofin process [27] is the principle of storing the needed reaction heat in the catalyst bed. A supported chromium oxide catalyst is used in this process."

[3] "The catalyst used for dehydrogenation is a supported platinum catalyst promoted with tin."

[4] "The catalyst used is a promoted chromium oxide powder with high attrition resistance."

The literature provides limited information to fully compare and contrast noble metal-based catalysts and metal oxide-based catalysts for light olefin dehydrogenation. However, some insights can be gleaned:

Compositions: 
- Noble metal catalysts: Supported platinum catalysts are mentioned, sometimes promoted with tin. 
- Metal oxide catalysts: Supported chromium oxide catalysts are discussed.

Effectiveness and industrial applications:
Both types of catalysts are used in commercial dehydrogenation processes, suggesting they are effective for this application. Specific processes mentioned include:
- UOP Oleflex (Pt catalyst)
- Lummus Catofin (chromium oxide catalyst)
- Phillips STAR (Pt-Sn catalyst)
- SnamprogettiYarsintez FBD-4 (promoted chromium oxide)

Recent developments and potential advantages:
The literature does not provide information on recent developments or compare the advantages of these catalyst types. More comprehensive and up-to-date sources would be needed to address these aspects.

In summary, while both noble metal and metal oxide catalysts are used industrially for light olefin dehydrogenation, the provided literature lacks sufficient detail to make a thorough comparison of their relative merits or discuss recent developments in the field.

该文献提供的信息有限，不足以全面比较贵金属基催化剂和金属氧化物基催化剂在轻烯烃脱氢方面的异同。但是，我们可以获得一些见解：

成分：
- 贵金属催化剂：提到了负载型铂催化剂，有时添加锡作为助剂。
- 金属氧化物催化剂：讨论了负载型铬氧化物催化剂。

有效性和工业应用：
这两类催化剂都用于商业脱氢工艺，表明它们对这种应用都是有效的。提到的具体工艺包括：
- UOP Oleflex（铂催化剂）
- Lummus Catofin（铬氧化物催化剂）
- Phillips STAR（铂-锡催化剂）
- SnamprogettiYarsintez FBD-4（改性铬氧化物）

最新发展和潜在优势：
该文献没有提供有关最新发展的信息，也没有比较这些催化剂类型的优势。需要更全面和最新的资料来解决这些方面的问题。

总之，虽然贵金属和金属氧化物催化剂都在工业上用于轻烯烃脱氢，但所提供的文献缺乏足够的细节来对它们的相对优点进行全面比较或讨论该领域的最新发展。
