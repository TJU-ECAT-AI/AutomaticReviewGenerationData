          [1] "As mentioned above, two main types of formulations are typically used for the nonoxidative dehydrogenation of light olefins: noble metal-based and metal oxide-based catalysts. Although Pt represents the only precious metal that has been extensively studied, various metal oxides have been successfully tested, CrOx being the most prominent example due to its industrial use."

[2] "Albeit all of the noble metals of group VIIIB are active in the nonoxidative hydrogenation of alkanes, Pt is the only noble metal utilized in commercial applications due to its superior activation of paraffinic CH bonds and low activity to CC cleavage."

[3] "The first industrial alkane dehydrogenation technology, the Pacol process (UOP), was first commercialized in 1968. On the basis of an alumina-supported platinum catalyst, the process greatly contributed to the widespread use of linear olefins in the detergent industry."

[4] "Noble metals are active for dehydrogenation in the metallic state, and in some cases a reduction step is necessary prior to reaction. The dehydrogenation reaction of light alkanes is insensitive to the structure of the platinum particles; that is, such reactions are independent of the platinum particle size or crystallographic plane exposed."

[5] "Despite the fact that platinum-based catalysts display very high activity in dehydrogenation reactions, their intrinsic selectivity to alkenes and catalyst stability are not entirely satisfactory. Consequently, the addition of promoters, which are able to modify the catalytic properties of platinum, is necessary to obtain an optimal catalyst."

[6] "High surface area alumina is the classical support employed in platinum-based dehydrogenation catalysts due to its high thermal stability, mechanical strength, and its exceptional ability of maintaining the platinum nanoparticles dispersed, which is crucial to attain stable catalyst performance."

[7] "Tin is by far the most studied promoter, and all of the platinum-based catalyst formulations that are industrially applied include this post-transition metal, the addition of which modifies both the platinum active phase and the support. Essentially, Sn suppresses hydrogenolysis and isomerization reactions, minimizes metal sintering, neutralizes the acidity of the support, and facilitates the diffusion of the coke species from the metal surface to the support."

          Noble metal-based catalysts (particularly Platinum) and metal oxide-based catalysts are the two main types used for nonoxidative dehydrogenation of light olefins.

Composition:
- Platinum-based catalysts: Typically consist of platinum nanoparticles supported on high surface area alumina, often promoted with tin.
- Metal oxide-based catalysts: Include CrOx, gallium, indium, vanadium, zinc, and molybdenum oxides.

Effectiveness:
- Platinum is highly effective due to its superior activation of paraffinic C-H bonds and low activity for C-C cleavage. The dehydrogenation reaction is insensitive to platinum particle size or structure.
- Metal oxides have been successfully tested, but specific effectiveness is not detailed in the given text.

Industrial applications:
- Platinum is the only noble metal used in commercial applications for nonoxidative dehydrogenation.
- The Pacol process, using alumina-supported platinum catalyst, was first commercialized in 1968 for linear olefin production in the detergent industry.
- CrOx is mentioned as the most prominent metal oxide example due to its industrial use.

Recent developments:
- For platinum catalysts: Focus on improving selectivity and stability through the use of promoters (especially tin) and optimizing support materials.
- Limited information is provided on recent developments for metal oxide catalysts.

Potential advantages:
- Platinum catalysts: High activity, well-established in industry, can be finely tuned with promoters and supports.
- Metal oxide catalysts: Potentially lower cost, but specific advantages are not detailed in the given text.

Challenges:
- Platinum catalysts face issues with selectivity and stability, requiring the use of promoters and careful support selection.
- Both types may face deactivation issues, particularly coke formation.

In summary, while platinum-based catalysts dominate the discussion due to their widespread industrial use and extensive research, metal oxide catalysts are acknowledged as an alternative. However, the text provides limited information for a comprehensive comparison of their relative advantages in the field.

          贵金属基催化剂（特别是铂）和金属氧化物基催化剂是用于轻烯烃非氧化脱氢的两种主要类型。

组成：
- 铂基催化剂：通常由负载在高比表面积氧化铝上的铂纳米颗粒组成，常常用锡进行促进。
- 金属氧化物基催化剂：包括CrOx、镓、铟、钒、锌和钼的氧化物。

有效性：
- 铂的高效性源于其对链烷C-H键的优异活化能力和对C-C键的低裂解活性。脱氢反应对铂颗粒的大小或结构不敏感。
- 金属氧化物已经成功测试，但文中未详细说明其具体效果。

工业应用：
- 铂是唯一用于非氧化脱氢商业应用的贵金属。
- Pacol工艺使用氧化铝负载的铂催化剂，于1968年首次商业化，用于洗涤剂行业的直链烯烃生产。
- CrOx被提及为最突出的金属氧化物例子，因为它在工业中有所应用。

最新发展：
- 对于铂催化剂：重点是通过使用促进剂（特别是锡）和优化载体材料来提高选择性和稳定性。
- 对金属氧化物催化剂的最新发展提供的信息有限。

潜在优势：
- 铂催化剂：高活性，在工业中已经成熟应用，可通过促进剂和载体进行精细调节。
- 金属氧化物催化剂：可能成本较低，但文中未详细说明其具体优势。

挑战：
- 铂催化剂面临选择性和稳定性问题，需要使用促进剂和仔细选择载体。
- 两种类型都可能面临失活问题，特别是积碳形成。

总之，虽然由于铂基催化剂的广泛工业应用和广泛研究而主导了讨论，但金属氧化物催化剂被认为是一种替代方案。然而，文中提供的信息有限，无法对它们在该领域的相对优势进行全面比较。
