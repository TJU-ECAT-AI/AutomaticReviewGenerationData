[1] "As mentioned above, two main types of formulations are typically used for the nonoxidative dehydrogenation of light olefins: noble metal-based and metal oxide-based catalysts. Although Pt represents the only precious metal that has been extensively studied, various metal oxides have been successfully tested, CrOx being the most prominent example due to its industrial use."

[2] "Albeit all of the noble metals of group VIIIB are active in the nonoxidative hydrogenation of alkanes, Pt is the only noble metal utilized in commercial applications due to its superior activation of paraffinic CH bonds and low activity to CC cleavage."

[3] "The first industrial alkane dehydrogenation technology, the Pacol process (UOP), was first commercialized in 1968. On the basis of an alumina-supported platinum catalyst, the process greatly contributed to the widespread use of linear olefins in the detergent industry."

[4] "Noble metals are active for dehydrogenation in the metallic state, and in some cases a reduction step is necessary prior to reaction. The dehydrogenation reaction of light alkanes is insensitive to the structure of the platinum particles; that is, such reactions are independent of the platinum particle size or crystallographic plane exposed."

[5] "Two main processes cause the deactivation of Pt-based dehydrogenation catalysts. First and foremost, the side reactions that form carbon deposits on the catalyst surface lead to the coverage of the active sites with coke, which results in a drop in activity."

[6] "Good supports for dehydrogenation of alkanes have to be thermally stable, especially under the harsh hydrothermal conditions that the material experiences during the regeneration step. In addition, limited support acidity is needed to avoid undesirable side reactions, such as coke formation and alkane isomerization."

[7] "Tin is by far the most studied promoter, and all of the platinum-based catalyst formulations that are industrially applied include this post-transition metal, the addition of which modifies both the platinum active phase and the support. Essentially, Sn suppresses hydrogenolysis and isomerization reactions, minimizes metal sintering, neutralizes the acidity of the support, and facilitates the diffusion of the coke species from the metal surface to the support."

Noble metal-based catalysts, particularly platinum, and metal oxide-based catalysts are the two main types used for nonoxidative dehydrogenation of light olefins. 

Composition:
- Platinum-based catalysts typically consist of platinum nanoparticles supported on materials like alumina or zeolites, often promoted with tin or other metals.
- Metal oxide-based catalysts include CrOx, gallium, indium, vanadium, zinc, and molybdenum oxides.

Effectiveness:
- Platinum is highly active for dehydrogenation reactions and is insensitive to particle structure.
- Metal oxides have been successfully tested, but less information is provided about their specific effectiveness.

Industrial applications:
- Platinum is the only noble metal used in commercial applications due to its superior activation of paraffinic C-H bonds and low activity for C-C cleavage.
- The Pacol process, using alumina-supported platinum catalysts, was first commercialized in 1968 for linear olefin production.
- CrOx is mentioned as the most prominent metal oxide example due to its industrial use.

Recent developments:
- Research has focused on improving platinum-based catalysts through the use of promoters like tin, which suppress side reactions, minimize sintering, and facilitate coke removal.
- Development of better supports with high thermal stability and low acidity to avoid undesirable side reactions.

Potential advantages:
- Platinum catalysts offer high activity and selectivity when properly promoted and supported.
- Metal oxide catalysts may offer cost advantages over noble metal catalysts, but their specific benefits are not detailed in the given text.

Both types of catalysts face challenges with deactivation due to coke formation and, in the case of platinum, sintering. The choice between noble metal and metal oxide catalysts likely depends on factors such as cost, specific reaction requirements, and desired product characteristics.

贵金属基催化剂（特别是铂）和金属氧化物基催化剂是用于轻烯烃非氧化脱氢的两种主要类型。

成分：
- 铂基催化剂通常由负载在氧化铝或沸石等材料上的铂纳米颗粒组成，常常用锡或其他金属进行促进。
- 金属氧化物基催化剂包括CrOx、镓、铟、钒、锌和钼的氧化物。

有效性：
- 铂对脱氢反应具有高活性，且对颗粒结构不敏感。
- 金属氧化物已经成功测试，但对其具体效果提供的信息较少。

工业应用：
- 由于铂在活化链烷C-H键方面表现出色，且对C-C键断裂的活性低，因此它是唯一在商业应用中使用的贵金属。
- 使用氧化铝负载铂催化剂的Pacol工艺于1968年首次实现商业化，用于直链烯烃生产。
- CrOx被提及为最突出的金属氧化物例子，因为它在工业中有所应用。

最新发展：
- 研究重点集中在通过使用锡等促进剂来改进铂基催化剂，这些促进剂可抑制副反应、最小化烧结并促进焦炭去除。
- 开发具有高热稳定性和低酸性的更好载体，以避免不良副反应。

潜在优势：
- 经过适当促进和负载的铂催化剂具有高活性和选择性。
- 金属氧化物催化剂可能比贵金属催化剂具有成本优势，但文中未详细说明其具体优点。

这两类催化剂都面临着由于焦炭形成而导致的失活问题，而铂还面临烧结问题。选择贵金属还是金属氧化物催化剂可能取决于成本、特定反应要求和所需产品特性等因素。
