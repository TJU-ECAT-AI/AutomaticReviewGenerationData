[1] "As mentioned above, two main types of formulations are typically used for the nonoxidative dehydrogenation of light olefins: noble metal-based and metal oxide-based catalysts. Although Pt represents the only precious metal that has been extensively studied, various metal oxides have been successfully tested, CrOx being the most prominent example due to its industrial use."

[2] "Albeit all of the noble metals of group VIIIB are active in the nonoxidative hydrogenation of alkanes, Pt is the only noble metal utilized in commercial applications due to its superior activation of paraffinic CH bonds and low activity to CC cleavage."

[3] "The first industrial alkane dehydrogenation technology, the Pacol process (UOP), was first commercialized in 1968. On the basis of an alumina-supported platinum catalyst, the process greatly contributed to the widespread use of linear olefins in the detergent industry."

[4] "Noble metals are active for dehydrogenation in the metallic state, and in some cases a reduction step is necessary prior to reaction. The dehydrogenation reaction of light alkanes is insensitive to the structure of the platinum particles; that is, such reactions are independent of the platinum particle size or crystallographic plane exposed."

[5] "Two main processes cause the deactivation of Pt-based dehydrogenation catalysts. First and foremost, the side reactions that form carbon deposits on the catalyst surface lead to the coverage of the active sites with coke, which results in a drop in activity."

[6] "Good supports for dehydrogenation of alkanes have to be thermally stable, especially under the harsh hydrothermal conditions that the material experiences during the regeneration step. In addition, limited support acidity is needed to avoid undesirable side reactions, such as coke formation and alkane isomerization."

[7] "Essentially, Sn suppresses hydrogenolysis and isomerization reactions, minimizes metal sintering, neutralizes the acidity of the support, and facilitates the diffusion of the coke species from the metal surface to the support."

Noble metal-based catalysts, particularly platinum, and metal oxide-based catalysts are the two main types used for nonoxidative dehydrogenation of light olefins. Here's a comparison:

Composition:
- Noble metal-based: Primarily platinum, often supported on materials like alumina and promoted with elements like tin.
- Metal oxide-based: Include CrOx, gallium, indium, vanadium, zinc, and molybdenum oxides.

Effectiveness:
- Platinum is highly active due to its superior activation of paraffinic C-H bonds and low activity for C-C cleavage.
- The effectiveness of metal oxide catalysts varies, with CrOx being the most prominent.

Industrial applications:
- Platinum-based catalysts are widely used in commercial processes like the Pacol process (UOP) and Oleflex process.
- CrOx is the most industrially used metal oxide catalyst.

Recent developments:
- Focus on improving platinum catalysts through better supports (e.g., zeolites) and promoters (e.g., Sn, Zn, Ga, In).
- Research on alternative metal oxides to improve performance and reduce environmental impact.

Potential advantages:
- Platinum catalysts: High activity, well-established in industry, can be finely tuned with promoters and supports.
- Metal oxide catalysts: Potentially lower cost, may offer environmental benefits over precious metals.

Challenges:
- Both types face deactivation issues, particularly coke formation.
- Platinum catalysts require careful management to prevent sintering and maintain dispersion.

In summary, while platinum-based catalysts dominate industrial applications due to their high activity and selectivity, ongoing research into both platinum and metal oxide catalysts aims to improve performance, stability, and cost-effectiveness in the nonoxidative dehydrogenation of light olefins.

贵金属基催化剂（特别是铂）和金属氧化物基催化剂是用于轻烯烃非氧化脱氢的两种主要类型。以下是它们的比较：

组成：
- 贵金属基：主要是铂，通常负载在氧化铝等材料上，并用锡等元素进行促进。
- 金属氧化物基：包括CrOx、镓、铟、钒、锌和钼的氧化物。

效能：
- 铂因其优异的烷烃C-H键活化能力和低C-C键断裂活性而具有很高的活性。
- 金属氧化物催化剂的效能各不相同，其中CrOx最为突出。

工业应用：
- 铂基催化剂广泛应用于商业过程，如Pacol过程（UOP）和Oleflex过程。
- CrOx是工业上使用最多的金属氧化物催化剂。

最新发展：
- 重点改进铂催化剂，通过更好的载体（如沸石）和促进剂（如Sn、Zn、Ga、In）。
- 研究替代金属氧化物以提高性能并减少环境影响。

潜在优势：
- 铂催化剂：活性高，在工业中已经确立，可通过促进剂和载体进行精细调节。
- 金属氧化物催化剂：可能成本较低，可能比贵金属提供环境效益。

挑战：
- 两种类型都面临失活问题，特别是积碳形成。
- 铂催化剂需要仔细管理以防止烧结并保持分散性。

总之，虽然铂基催化剂因其高活性和选择性而在工业应用中占主导地位，但对铂和金属氧化物催化剂的持续研究旨在改善轻烯烃非氧化脱氢过程中的性能、稳定性和成本效益。
