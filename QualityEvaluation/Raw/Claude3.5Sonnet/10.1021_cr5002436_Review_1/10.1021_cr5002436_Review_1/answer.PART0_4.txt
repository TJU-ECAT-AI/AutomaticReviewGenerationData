[1] "As mentioned above, two main types of formulations are typically used for the nonoxidative dehydrogenation of light olefins: noble metal-based and metal oxide-based catalysts. Although Pt represents the only precious metal that has been extensively studied, various metal oxides have been successfully tested, CrOx being the most prominent example due to its industrial use."

[2] "Albeit all of the noble metals of group VIIIB are active in the nonoxidative hydrogenation of alkanes, Pt is the only noble metal utilized in commercial applications due to its superior activation of paraffinic CH bonds and low activity to CC cleavage."

[3] "The first industrial alkane dehydrogenation technology, the Pacol process (UOP), was first commercialized in 1968. On the basis of an alumina-supported platinum catalyst, the process greatly contributed to the widespread use of linear olefins in the detergent industry."

[4] "Noble metals are active for dehydrogenation in the metallic state, and in some cases a reduction step is necessary prior to reaction. The dehydrogenation reaction of light alkanes is insensitive to the structure of the platinum particles; that is, such reactions are independent of the platinum particle size or crystallographic plane exposed."

[5] "High surface area alumina is the classical support employed in platinum-based dehydrogenation catalysts due to its high thermal stability, mechanical strength, and its exceptional ability of maintaining the platinum nanoparticles dispersed, which is crucial to attain stable catalyst performance."

[6] "Tin is by far the most studied promoter, and all of the platinum-based catalyst formulations that are industrially applied include this post-transition metal, the addition of which modifies both the platinum active phase and the support. Essentially, Sn suppresses hydrogenolysis and isomerization reactions, minimizes metal sintering, neutralizes the acidity of the support, and facilitates the diffusion of the coke species from the metal surface to the support."

The literature primarily focuses on noble metal-based catalysts, particularly platinum, for the nonoxidative dehydrogenation of light olefins. While it mentions that metal oxide-based catalysts like CrOx, gallium, indium, vanadium, zinc, and molybdenum oxides have been successfully tested, it does not provide detailed information about their compositions, effectiveness, or recent developments.

Platinum-based catalysts:
1. Composition: Typically consist of platinum supported on high surface area alumina, often promoted with tin.
2. Effectiveness: Superior activation of paraffinic C-H bonds and low activity for C-C cleavage. The dehydrogenation reaction is insensitive to platinum particle size or structure.
3. Industrial applications: Widely used in commercial processes like the Pacol process (UOP) and Oleflex process for producing linear olefins and propylene.
4. Recent developments: Focus on improving catalyst stability and selectivity through the use of promoters (especially tin) and optimizing support materials.
5. Advantages: High activity, well-established industrial use, and the ability to be modified with promoters for improved performance.

Metal oxide-based catalysts:
The literature provides limited information on metal oxide-based catalysts. It only mentions that CrOx is the most prominent example due to its industrial use, and that various other metal oxides have been successfully tested. However, specific details about their compositions, effectiveness, or recent developments are not provided in the given text.

In conclusion, while both noble metal-based and metal oxide-based catalysts are used for nonoxidative dehydrogenation of light olefins, the literature primarily focuses on platinum-based catalysts, which are well-established in industrial applications and have been extensively studied and optimized.

文献主要集中在用于轻质烯烃非氧化脱氢的贵金属基催化剂上，特别是铂。虽然提到了CrOx、镓、铟、钒、锌和钼氧化物等金属氧化物基催化剂已经成功测试，但没有提供关于它们的组成、有效性或最新发展的详细信息。

铂基催化剂：
1. 组成：通常由高比表面积氧化铝支撑的铂组成，常常以锡作为促进剂。
2. 有效性：对链烷C-H键的活化能力优越，对C-C键的裂解活性低。脱氢反应对铂颗粒的大小或结构不敏感。
3. 工业应用：广泛应用于商业过程，如UOP的Pacol工艺和Oleflex工艺，用于生产直链烯烃和丙烯。
4. 最新发展：重点是通过使用促进剂（尤其是锡）和优化支撑材料来提高催化剂的稳定性和选择性。
5. 优势：活性高，工业应用成熟，可通过促进剂改性以提高性能。

金属氧化物基催化剂：
文献对金属氧化物基催化剂的信息有限。仅提到CrOx因其工业应用而成为最突出的例子，其他各种金属氧化物也已成功测试。然而，给定的文本中没有提供关于它们的组成、有效性或最新发展的具体细节。

总之，虽然贵金属基和金属氧化物基催化剂都用于轻质烯烃的非氧化脱氢，但文献主要集中在铂基催化剂上，这类催化剂在工业应用中已经成熟，并且已经进行了广泛的研究和优化。
