[1] "As mentioned above, two main types of formulations are typically used for the nonoxidative dehydrogenation of light olefins: noble metal-based and metal oxide-based catalysts. Although Pt represents the only precious metal that has been extensively studied, various metal oxides have been successfully tested, CrOx being the most prominent example due to its industrial use."

[2] "Albeit all of the noble metals of group VIIIB are active in the nonoxidative hydrogenation of alkanes, Pt is the only noble metal utilized in commercial applications due to its superior activation of paraffinic CH bonds and low activity to CC cleavage."

[3] "The first industrial alkane dehydrogenation technology, the Pacol process (UOP), was first commercialized in 1968. On the basis of an alumina-supported platinum catalyst, the process greatly contributed to the widespread use of linear olefins in the detergent industry."

[4] "Noble metals are active for dehydrogenation in the metallic state, and in some cases a reduction step is necessary prior to reaction. The dehydrogenation reaction of light alkanes is insensitive to the structure of the platinum particles; that is, such reactions are independent of the platinum particle size or crystallographic plane exposed."

[5] "Despite the fact that platinum-based catalysts display very high activity in dehydrogenation reactions, their intrinsic selectivity to alkenes and catalyst stability are not entirely satisfactory. Consequently, the addition of promoters, which are able to modify the catalytic properties of platinum, is necessary to obtain an optimal catalyst."

The literature primarily focuses on platinum-based catalysts for nonoxidative dehydrogenation of light olefins, with limited information on metal oxide-based catalysts. However, we can compare and contrast based on the available information:

Composition:
- Noble metal-based catalysts: Primarily use platinum, often supported on alumina or other materials. Promoters like tin are added to improve performance.
- Metal oxide-based catalysts: Include CrOx, gallium, indium, vanadium, zinc, and molybdenum oxides.

Effectiveness:
- Platinum-based catalysts show very high activity in dehydrogenation reactions but may have issues with selectivity and stability.
- Metal oxide catalysts have been successfully tested, but specific effectiveness is not detailed in the given text.

Industrial applications:
- Platinum-based catalysts are widely used in commercial applications, such as the Pacol process and Oleflex process for producing linear olefins and propylene.
- CrOx is mentioned as the most prominent example of metal oxide catalysts due to its industrial use, but specifics are not provided.

Recent developments:
- For platinum catalysts, research focuses on improving selectivity and stability through the use of promoters and support materials.
- The text does not provide information on recent developments for metal oxide catalysts.

Potential advantages:
- Platinum catalysts: High activity, insensitivity to particle structure, and extensive industrial experience.
- Metal oxide catalysts: Potentially lower cost compared to noble metals, but specific advantages are not detailed in the given text.

In summary, while platinum-based catalysts dominate the discussion due to their widespread industrial use and extensive research, metal oxide catalysts are acknowledged as an alternative. However, the text provides limited information for a comprehensive comparison of their relative advantages in the field.

- 金属氧化物基催化剂：包括CrOx、镓、铟、钒、锌和钼的氧化物。

有效性：
- 铂基催化剂在脱氢反应中表现出很高的活性，但可能存在选择性和稳定性问题。
- 金属氧化物催化剂已经成功测试，但文中未详细说明具体效果。

工业应用：
- 铂基催化剂广泛应用于商业应用，如Pacol工艺和Oleflex工艺，用于生产线性烯烃和丙烯。
- CrOx被提及为金属氧化物催化剂中最突出的例子，因为它在工业中的应用，但未提供具体细节。

最新发展：
- 对于铂催化剂，研究重点是通过使用助剂和载体材料来提高选择性和稳定性。
- 文中未提供金属氧化物催化剂的最新发展信息。

潜在优势：
