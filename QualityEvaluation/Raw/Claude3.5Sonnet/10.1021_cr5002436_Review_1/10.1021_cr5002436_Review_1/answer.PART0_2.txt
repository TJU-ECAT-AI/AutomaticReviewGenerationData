[1] "As mentioned above, two main types of formulations are typically used for the nonoxidative dehydrogenation of light olefins: noble metal-based and metal oxide-based catalysts. Although Pt represents the only precious metal that has been extensively studied, various metal oxides have been successfully tested, CrOx being the most prominent example due to its industrial use."

[2] "Albeit all of the noble metals of group VIIIB are active in the nonoxidative hydrogenation of alkanes, Pt is the only noble metal utilized in commercial applications due to its superior activation of paraffinic CH bonds and low activity to CC cleavage."

[3] "The first industrial alkane dehydrogenation technology, the Pacol process (UOP), was first commercialized in 1968. On the basis of an alumina-supported platinum catalyst, the process greatly contributed to the widespread use of linear olefins in the detergent industry."

[4] "Despite the fact that platinum-based catalysts display very high activity in dehydrogenation reactions, their intrinsic selectivity to alkenes and catalyst stability are not entirely satisfactory. Consequently, the addition of promoters, which are able to modify the catalytic properties of platinum, is necessary to obtain an optimal catalyst."

[5] "Tin is by far the most studied promoter, and all of the platinum-based catalyst formulations that are industrially applied include this post-transition metal, the addition of which modifies both the platinum active phase and the support."

Noble metal-based catalysts, particularly Platinum (Pt), and metal oxide-based catalysts are the two main types used in nonoxidative dehydrogenation of light olefins.

Composition:
- Pt-based catalysts: Typically alumina-supported platinum, often promoted with tin (Sn) or other metals like zinc, gallium, or indium.
- Metal oxide-based: Include CrOx, gallium, indium, vanadium, zinc, and molybdenum oxides.

Effectiveness:
- Pt-based catalysts show very high activity in dehydrogenation reactions but may have issues with selectivity and stability.
- Metal oxide-based catalysts have been successfully tested, with CrOx being prominent.

Industrial applications:
- Pt is the only noble metal used in commercial applications for nonoxidative dehydrogenation.
- The Pacol process, using alumina-supported platinum catalyst, was first commercialized in 1968 for linear olefin production in the detergent industry.

Recent developments:
- Addition of promoters (e.g., Sn) to Pt-based catalysts to improve selectivity, stability, and overall performance.
- Research into various metal oxides as potential catalysts.

Potential advantages:
- Pt-based: High activity, well-established in industry.
- Metal oxide-based: Potentially lower cost, different selectivity profiles.

The literature provides more detailed information on Pt-based catalysts, suggesting they are currently more widely used and studied in this field.
