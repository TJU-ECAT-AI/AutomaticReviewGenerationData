[1] "As mentioned above, two main types of formulations are typically used for the nonoxidative dehydrogenation of light olefins: noble metal-based and metal oxide-based catalysts. Although Pt represents the only precious metal that has been extensively studied, various metal oxides have been successfully tested, CrOx being the most prominent example due to its industrial use."

[2] "Albeit all of the noble metals of group VIIIB are active in the nonoxidative hydrogenation of alkanes, Pt is the only noble metal utilized in commercial applications due to its superior activation of paraffinic CH bonds and low activity to CC cleavage."

[3] "The first industrial alkane dehydrogenation technology, the Pacol process (UOP), was first commercialized in 1968. On the basis of an alumina-supported platinum catalyst, the process greatly contributed to the widespread use of linear olefins in the detergent industry."

[4] "Noble metals are active for dehydrogenation in the metallic state, and in some cases a reduction step is necessary prior to reaction. The dehydrogenation reaction of light alkanes is insensitive to the structure of the platinum particles; that is, such reactions are independent of the platinum particle size or crystallographic plane exposed."

[5] "Despite the fact that platinum-based catalysts display very high activity in dehydrogenation reactions, their intrinsic selectivity to alkenes and catalyst stability are not entirely satisfactory. Consequently, the addition of promoters, which are able to modify the catalytic properties of platinum, is necessary to obtain an optimal catalyst."

The literature primarily focuses on platinum-based catalysts for nonoxidative dehydrogenation of light olefins, with limited information on metal oxide-based catalysts. However, we can compare and contrast based on the available information:

Composition:
- Noble metal-based catalysts: Primarily use platinum, often supported on alumina or other materials. Promoters like tin are added to improve performance.
- Metal oxide-based catalysts: Include CrOx, gallium, indium, vanadium, zinc, and molybdenum oxides.

Effectiveness:
- Platinum-based catalysts show very high activity in dehydrogenation reactions but may have issues with selectivity and stability.
- Metal oxide catalysts have been successfully tested, but specific effectiveness is not detailed in the given text.

Industrial applications:
- Platinum-based catalysts are widely used in commercial applications, such as the Pacol process and Oleflex process for producing linear olefins and propylene.
- CrOx is mentioned as the most prominent example of metal oxide catalysts due to its industrial use, but specifics are not provided.

Recent developments:
- For platinum catalysts, research focuses on improving selectivity and stability through the use of promoters and support materials.
- The text does not provide information on recent developments for metal oxide catalysts.

Potential advantages:
- Platinum catalysts: High activity, insensitivity to particle structure, and extensive industrial experience.
- Metal oxide catalysts: Potentially lower cost compared to noble metals, but specific advantages are not detailed in the given text.

In summary, while platinum-based catalysts dominate the discussion due to their widespread industrial use and extensive research, metal oxide catalysts are acknowledged as an alternative. However, the text provides limited information for a comprehensive comparison of their relative advantages in the field.

[5] "Two main processes cause the deactivation of Pt-based dehydrogenation catalysts. First and foremost, the side reactions that form carbon deposits on the catalyst surface lead to the coverage of the active sites with coke, which results in a drop in activity."

[6] "Good supports for dehydrogenation of alkanes have to be thermally stable, especially under the harsh hydrothermal conditions that the material experiences during the regeneration step. In addition, limited support acidity is needed to avoid undesirable side reactions, such as coke formation and alkane isomerization."

[7] "Essentially, Sn suppresses hydrogenolysis and isomerization reactions, minimizes metal sintering, neutralizes the acidity of the support, and facilitates the diffusion of the coke species from the metal surface to the support."

Noble metal-based catalysts, particularly platinum, and metal oxide-based catalysts are the two main types used for nonoxidative dehydrogenation of light olefins. Here's a comparison:

Composition:
- Noble metal-based: Primarily platinum, often supported on materials like alumina and promoted with elements like tin.
- Metal oxide-based: Include CrOx, gallium, indium, vanadium, zinc, and molybdenum oxides.

Effectiveness:
- Platinum is highly active due to its superior activation of paraffinic C-H bonds and low activity for C-C cleavage.
- The effectiveness of metal oxide catalysts varies, with CrOx being the most prominent.

Industrial applications:
- Platinum-based catalysts are widely used in commercial processes like the Pacol process (UOP) and Oleflex process.
- CrOx is the most industrially used metal oxide catalyst.

Recent developments:
- Focus on improving platinum catalysts through better supports (e.g., zeolites) and promoters (e.g., Sn, Zn, Ga, In).
- Research on alternative metal oxides to improve performance and reduce environmental impact.

Potential advantages:
- Platinum catalysts: High activity, well-established in industry, can be finely tuned with promoters and supports.
- Metal oxide catalysts: Potentially lower cost, may offer environmental benefits over precious metals.

Challenges:
- Both types face deactivation issues, particularly coke formation.
- Platinum catalysts require careful management to prevent sintering and maintain dispersion.

In summary, while platinum-based catalysts dominate industrial applications due to their high activity and selectivity, ongoing research into both platinum and metal oxide catalysts aims to improve performance, stability, and cost-effectiveness in the nonoxidative dehydrogenation of light olefins.

3. Industrial applications: Widely used in commercial processes like the Pacol process (UOP) and Oleflex process for producing linear olefins and propylene.
4. Recent developments: Focus on improving catalyst stability and selectivity through the use of promoters (especially tin) and optimizing support materials.
5. Advantages: High activity, well-established industrial use, and the ability to be modified with promoters for improved performance.

Metal oxide-based catalysts:
The literature provides limited information on metal oxide-based catalysts. It only mentions that CrOx is the most prominent example due to its industrial use, and that various other metal oxides have been successfully tested. However, specific details about their compositions, effectiveness, or recent developments are not provided in the given text.

In conclusion, while both noble metal-based and metal oxide-based catalysts are used for nonoxidative dehydrogenation of light olefins, the literature primarily focuses on platinum-based catalysts, which are well-established in industrial applications and have been extensively studied and optimized.
