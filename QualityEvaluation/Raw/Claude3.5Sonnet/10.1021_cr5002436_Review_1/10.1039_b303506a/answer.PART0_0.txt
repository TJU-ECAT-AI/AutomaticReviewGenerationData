[1] "Platinum-based materials are widely used in petrochemical and refining processes, such as alkane dehydrogenation."

[3] "PtGa/MgAl2O4, Pt/silicalite, and PtZn/silicalite also show higher selectivity and stability than Pt/g-Al2O3."

[4] "Here, we report a novel catalyst with unprecedented site activity and stability for propane and isobutane dehydrogenation. Exchanged Pt cations (0.10 wt%) in ZSM5 with Fe3+ in framework positions and Na as balancing cations lead to high alkene selectivities, near-equilibrium alkene yields, and turnover rates and stability significantly higher than previously reported."

The literature primarily focuses on platinum-based catalysts for light alkane dehydrogenation, particularly propane and isobutane. It does not provide direct comparisons with metal oxide-based catalysts like CrOx, gallium, indium, vanadium, zinc, and molybdenum oxides.

For platinum-based catalysts:

Composition: The study presents a novel catalyst composed of exchanged Pt cations (0.10 wt%) in ZSM5 zeolite with Fe3+ in framework positions and Na as balancing cations.

Effectiveness: This new Pt/Na-[Fe]ZSM5 catalyst shows high alkene selectivities, near-equilibrium alkene yields, and significantly higher turnover rates and stability compared to previously reported catalysts.

Industrial applications: Platinum-based materials are widely used in petrochemical and refining processes, including alkane dehydrogenation.

Recent developments: The study reports a novel Pt/Na-[Fe]ZSM5 catalyst with unprecedented site activity and stability for propane and isobutane dehydrogenation.

Potential advantages: The new catalyst shows improved performance over traditional Pt/g-Al2O3 catalysts. Addition of Sn to Pt catalysts inhibits cracking, isomerization, and coke formation. PtGa/MgAl2O4, Pt/silicalite, and PtZn/silicalite show higher selectivity and stability than Pt/g-Al2O3.

The literature does not provide information on metal oxide-based catalysts for comparison. To fully answer the question, additional research on metal oxide-based catalysts would be necessary.

这篇文献主要关注了用于轻烷烃脱氢的铂基催化剂,特别是丙烷和异丁烷。它没有直接与金属氧化物基催化剂(如CrOx、镓、铟、钒、锌和钼氧化物)进行比较。

对于铂基催化剂:

成分:研究提出了一种新型催化剂,由交换的Pt阳离子(0.10 wt%)在ZSM5分子筛中组成,其中Fe3+位于骨架位置,Na+作为平衡阳离子。

效果:这种新型Pt/Na-[Fe]ZSM5催化剂表现出高烯烃选择性、接近平衡的烯烃产率,以及明显高于先前报道的催化剂的转化率和稳定性。

工业应用:铂基材料广泛应用于石油化工和炼油过程,包括烷烃脱氢。

最新进展:研究报道了一种新型Pt/Na-[Fe]ZSM5催化剂,在丙烷和异丁烷脱氢方面表现出前所未有的活性位点活性和稳定性。

潜在优势:新催化剂比传统的Pt/g-Al2O3催化剂表现更好。向Pt催化剂中添加Sn可抑制裂化、异构化和积碳的形成。PtGa/MgAl2O4、Pt/硅烷石和PtZn/硅烷石表现出比Pt/g-Al2O3更高的选择性和稳定性。

文献没有提供金属氧化物基催化剂的信息以供比较。要全面回答这个问题,需要对金属氧化物基催化剂进行额外的研究。
