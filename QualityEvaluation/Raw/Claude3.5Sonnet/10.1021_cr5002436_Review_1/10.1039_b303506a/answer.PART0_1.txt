[1] "Platinum-based materials are widely used in petrochemical and refining processes, such as alkane dehydrogenation."

[2] "Sn inhibits cracking, isomerization, and coke formation on Pt supported on Al2O3, SiO2, ZrO2, MgAl2O4, and KL zeolite."

[3] "Here, we report a novel catalyst with unprecedented site activity and stability for propane and isobutane dehydrogenation. Exchanged Pt cations (0.10 wt%) in ZSM5 with Fe3+ in framework positions and Na as balancing cations lead to high alkene selectivities, near-equilibrium alkene yields, and turnover rates and stability significantly higher than previously reported."

[4] "Pt/Na-[Fe]ZSM5 gave substantially higher reaction rates and catalyst stability than these state-of-the-art Pt-based dehydrogenation catalysts."

The literature primarily focuses on platinum-based catalysts for light olefin dehydrogenation, particularly a novel Pt/Na-[Fe]ZSM5 catalyst. It does not provide extensive information on metal oxide-based catalysts for comparison. However, based on the available information:

1. Composition: The novel catalyst consists of platinum cations (0.10 wt%) exchanged in ZSM5 zeolite with Fe3+ in framework positions and Na as balancing cations.

2. Effectiveness: The Pt/Na-[Fe]ZSM5 catalyst shows high alkene selectivities, near-equilibrium alkene yields, and significantly higher turnover rates and stability compared to previously reported catalysts.

3. Industrial applications: Platinum-based materials are widely used in petrochemical and refining processes, including alkane dehydrogenation.

4. Recent developments: The Pt/Na-[Fe]ZSM5 catalyst represents a significant advancement in the field, offering unprecedented site activity and stability for propane and isobutane dehydrogenation.

5. Potential advantages: The novel catalyst demonstrates substantially higher reaction rates and catalyst stability compared to state-of-the-art Pt-based dehydrogenation catalysts. It also shows improved resistance to cracking, isomerization, and coke formation.

The literature does not provide information on metal oxide-based catalysts such as CrOx, gallium, indium, vanadium, zinc, and molybdenum oxides for comparison. Therefore, a comprehensive comparison between noble metal-based and metal oxide-based catalysts cannot be made based solely on this document.
