          [1] "Platinum-based materials are widely used in petrochemical and refining processes, such as alkane dehydrogenation."

[2] "Sn inhibits cracking, isomerization, and coke formation on Pt supported on Al2O3, SiO2, ZrO2, MgAl2O4, and KL zeolite."

[3] "PtGa/MgAl2O4, Pt/silicalite, and PtZn/silicalite also show higher selectivity and stability than Pt/g-Al2O3."

[4] "Here, we report a novel catalyst with unprecedented site activity and stability for propane and isobutane dehydrogenation. Exchanged Pt cations (0.10 wt%) in ZSM5 with Fe3+ in framework positions and Na as balancing cations lead to high alkene selectivities, near-equilibrium alkene yields, and turnover rates and stability significantly higher than previously reported."

[5] "Pt/Na-[Fe]ZSM5 gave substantially higher reaction rates and catalyst stability than these state-of-the-art Pt-based dehydrogenation catalysts."

[6] "Small Pt clusters in Na-[Fe]ZSM5 give high alkene selectivities, near-equilibrium alkene yields, and unprecedented stability in the catalytic dehydrogenation of light alkanes."

[7] "We achieve these improvements without relying on bimetallic clusters, which can unmix during oxidative regenerations, and without significant H2 partial pressures in alkane reactant streams."

          The literature primarily focuses on platinum-based catalysts for light alkane dehydrogenation, particularly propane and isobutane. It does not provide a comprehensive comparison with metal oxide-based catalysts such as CrOx, gallium, indium, vanadium, zinc, and molybdenum oxides.

Platinum-based catalysts:

1. Composition: Various platinum-based catalysts are discussed, including:
   - Pt supported on Al2O3, SiO2, ZrO2, MgAl2O4, and KL zeolite
   - Bimetallic catalysts like PtSn, PtGa, and PtZn
   - A novel catalyst: Pt/Na-[Fe]ZSM5 (0.10 wt% Pt cations exchanged in ZSM5 with Fe3+ in framework positions and Na as balancing cations)

2. Effectiveness: Platinum-based catalysts, especially the novel Pt/Na-[Fe]ZSM5, demonstrate:
   - High alkene selectivities
   - Near-equilibrium alkene yields
   - High turnover rates
   - Unprecedented stability in light alkane dehydrogenation

3. Industrial applications: These catalysts are widely used in petrochemical and refining processes, particularly for alkane dehydrogenation.

4. Recent developments: The study introduces Pt/Na-[Fe]ZSM5 as a novel catalyst with:
   - Unprecedented site activity and stability for propane and isobutane dehydrogenation
   - Substantially higher reaction rates and catalyst stability compared to other state-of-the-art Pt-based dehydrogenation catalysts

5. Potential advantages of Pt/Na-[Fe]ZSM5:
   - Higher alkene selectivities and near-equilibrium yields
   - Significantly higher turnover rates and stability
   - Lower deactivation rates
   - Ability to operate at lower temperatures (for isobutane dehydrogenation)
   - Less reliance on hydrogen addition for stability
   - Easy regeneration without loss of catalytic properties
   - Improvements achieved without relying on bimetallic clusters or significant H2 partial pressures in alkane reactant streams

The literature does not provide information on metal oxide-based catalysts, so a comprehensive comparison between noble metal-based and metal oxide-based catalysts cannot be made based on this document alone.

该文献没有提供关于金属氧化物基催化剂的信息，因此仅基于这份文档无法进行贵金属基和金属氧化物基催化剂之间的全面比较。
