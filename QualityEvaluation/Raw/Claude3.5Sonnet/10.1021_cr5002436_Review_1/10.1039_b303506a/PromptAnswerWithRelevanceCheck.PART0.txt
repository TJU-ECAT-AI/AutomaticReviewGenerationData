The literature primarily focuses on platinum-based catalysts for light alkane dehydrogenation, particularly propane and isobutane. It does not provide direct comparisons with metal oxide-based catalysts like CrOx, gallium, indium, vanadium, zinc, and molybdenum oxides.

For platinum-based catalysts:

Composition: The study presents a novel catalyst composed of exchanged Pt cations (0.10 wt%) in ZSM5 zeolite with Fe3+ in framework positions and Na as balancing cations.

Effectiveness: This new Pt/Na-[Fe]ZSM5 catalyst shows high alkene selectivities, near-equilibrium alkene yields, and significantly higher turnover rates and stability compared to previously reported catalysts.

Industrial applications: Platinum-based materials are widely used in petrochemical and refining processes, including alkane dehydrogenation.

Recent developments: The study reports a novel Pt/Na-[Fe]ZSM5 catalyst with unprecedented site activity and stability for propane and isobutane dehydrogenation.

Potential advantages: The new catalyst shows improved performance over traditional Pt/g-Al2O3 catalysts. Addition of Sn to Pt catalysts inhibits cracking, isomerization, and coke formation. PtGa/MgAl2O4, Pt/silicalite, and PtZn/silicalite show higher selectivity and stability than Pt/g-Al2O3.

The literature does not provide information on metal oxide-based catalysts for comparison. To fully answer the question, additional research on metal oxide-based catalysts would be necessary.
