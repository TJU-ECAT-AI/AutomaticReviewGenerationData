The literature primarily focuses on platinum-based catalysts for light alkane dehydrogenation, particularly a novel Pt/Na-[Fe]ZSM5 catalyst. It does not provide direct comparisons with metal oxide-based catalysts like CrOx, gallium, indium, vanadium, zinc, and molybdenum oxides.

Platinum-based catalysts:

Composition: The study discusses a Pt/Na-[Fe]ZSM5 catalyst, where small Pt clusters are supported on a Na-[Fe]ZSM5 zeolite.

Effectiveness: This novel catalyst shows high alkene selectivities, near-equilibrium alkene yields, and unprecedented stability in light alkane dehydrogenation.

Industrial applications: Platinum-based materials are widely used in petrochemical and refining processes, including alkane dehydrogenation.

Recent developments: The Pt/Na-[Fe]ZSM5 catalyst demonstrates substantially higher reaction rates and stability compared to other state-of-the-art Pt-based dehydrogenation catalysts.

Potential advantages: The catalyst achieves improvements without relying on bimetallic clusters or significant H2 partial pressures in alkane reactant streams. It can be fully regenerated using mild oxidative treatments without a detectable decrease in Pt dispersion, zeolite crystallinity, or catalytic selectivities.

The literature does not provide information on metal oxide-based catalysts for comparison. To fully answer the question, additional sources would be needed to discuss the characteristics and performance of metal oxide-based catalysts in light olefin dehydrogenation.

该文献主要关注用于轻烷烃脱氢的铂基催化剂，特别是一种新型的Pt/Na-[Fe]ZSM5催化剂。它没有直接与金属氧化物基催化剂（如CrOx、镓、铟、钒、锌和钼氧化物）进行比较。

铂基催化剂：

组成：研究讨论了Pt/Na-[Fe]ZSM5催化剂，其中小的Pt簇支撑在Na-[Fe]ZSM5沸石上。

有效性：这种新型催化剂在轻烷烃脱氢中表现出高烯烃选择性、接近平衡的烯烃产率和前所未有的稳定性。

工业应用：铂基材料广泛应用于石油化工和炼油过程，包括烷烃脱氢。

最新发展：与其他最先进的铂基脱氢催化剂相比，Pt/Na-[Fe]ZSM5催化剂表现出明显更高的反应速率和稳定性。

潜在优势：该催化剂在不依赖双金属簇或烷烃反应物流中的显著H2分压的情况下实现了改进。它可以通过温和的氧化处理完全再生，而不会导致Pt分散度、沸石结晶度或催化选择性的明显降低。

文献没有提供金属氧化物基催化剂的信息以供比较。要全面回答这个问题，需要额外的资料来讨论金属氧化物基催化剂在轻烯烃脱氢中的特性和性能。
