The literature primarily focuses on platinum-based catalysts for light alkane dehydrogenation, particularly propane and isobutane. It does not provide a direct comparison with metal oxide-based catalysts such as CrOx, gallium, indium, vanadium, zinc, and molybdenum oxides.

Platinum-based catalysts:

Composition: The study discusses various platinum-based catalysts, including Pt supported on Al2O3, SiO2, ZrO2, MgAl2O4, and KL zeolite. It also mentions bimetallic catalysts like PtSn, PtGa, and PtZn. The main focus is on a novel catalyst: Pt/Na-[Fe]ZSM5.

Effectiveness: Platinum-based catalysts, especially the novel Pt/Na-[Fe]ZSM5, show high alkene selectivities and near-equilibrium alkene yields. They demonstrate high turnover rates and stability.

Industrial applications: These catalysts are widely used in petrochemical and refining processes, particularly for alkane dehydrogenation.

Recent developments: The study introduces Pt/Na-[Fe]ZSM5 as a novel catalyst with unprecedented site activity and stability for propane and isobutane dehydrogenation. This catalyst shows higher reaction rates and stability compared to other state-of-the-art Pt-based dehydrogenation catalysts.

Potential advantages: Pt/Na-[Fe]ZSM5 offers several advantages:
1. Higher alkene selectivities and near-equilibrium yields
2. Significantly higher turnover rates and stability
3. Lower deactivation rates
4. Ability to operate at lower temperatures (for isobutane dehydrogenation)
5. Less reliance on hydrogen addition for stability
6. Easy regeneration without loss of catalytic properties

The literature does not provide information on metal oxide-based catalysts, so a comparison cannot be made based on this document alone.
