[1] "Pt-based catalysts are among the most active and selective for alkane dehydrogenation."

[2] "Pt/Na[Fe]ZSM-5 materials, prepared by ion-exchange of Pt onto Na[Fe]ZSM-5, showed unprecedented rates and stability in the selective dehydrogenation of C2C4 alkanes."

[3] "CsPt/Na[Fe]ZSM-5 samples gave much higher selectivities to linear pentenes (96%) than Pt/Na[Fe]ZSM-5 (28%)."

[4] "These materials catalyze dehydrogenation of larger n-alkanes with unprecedented rates and with very high selectivity to n-alkenes. The catalyst stability is excellent in comparison with catalytic materials in previous reports, which required much higher H2 pressures for stable operation."

The literature focuses primarily on platinum-based catalysts for alkane dehydrogenation, particularly Pt/Na[Fe]ZSM-5 and CsPt/Na[Fe]ZSM-5. It does not provide information on metal oxide-based catalysts like CrOx, gallium, indium, vanadium, zinc, and molybdenum oxides.

For platinum-based catalysts:

Composition: The catalysts discussed are Pt clusters supported on [Fe]ZSM-5 zeolites, modified with Na and Cs cations.

Effectiveness: These catalysts show high activity and selectivity for alkane dehydrogenation. CsPt/Na[Fe]ZSM-5 demonstrated particularly high selectivity (96%) for linear pentenes.

Recent developments: The addition of Cs to Pt/Na[Fe]ZSM-5 after reduction of Pt cations led to improved selectivity and stability, especially for larger alkanes like n-heptane.

Potential advantages: These catalysts offer high rates, excellent stability, and high selectivity to linear alkenes. They operate effectively at lower H2 pressures compared to previous catalysts, making them promising for industrial applications.

The document does not provide information to compare these platinum-based catalysts with metal oxide-based catalysts for light olefin dehydrogenation. To fully answer the question, additional information on metal oxide catalysts would be needed.

Composition: The study discusses Pt/Na[Fe]ZSM-5 and CsPt/Na[Fe]ZSM-5 catalysts. These are platinum supported on iron-containing zeolites, with sodium and cesium added as promoters.

Effectiveness: Pt-based catalysts are described as among the most active and selective for alkane dehydrogenation. The CsPt/Na[Fe]ZSM-5 catalyst showed high selectivity (96%) for linear pentenes and ten-fold higher heptene formation rates compared to a PtSn/Al2O3ClLi catalyst.

Recent developments: The addition of Cs to Pt/Na[Fe]ZSM-5 after reduction of Pt cations led to improved selectivity for linear alkenes and inhibition of skeletal isomerization and cracking side reactions.

Potential advantages: The catalysts showed high activity, selectivity, and stability even at low H2 pressures or without H2. They were effective for dehydrogenation of both light (C2-C4) and heavier (C5-C7) alkanes.

Industrial applications: While not explicitly stated, the high performance in n-pentane and n-heptane dehydrogenation suggests potential applications in the production of linear alkenes for use in chemicals and petrochemicals.
