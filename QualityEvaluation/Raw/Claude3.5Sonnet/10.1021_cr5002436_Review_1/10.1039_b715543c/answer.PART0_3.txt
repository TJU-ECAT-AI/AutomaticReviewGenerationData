[1] "Pt-based catalysts are among the most active and selective for alkane dehydrogenation."

[2] "Pt/Na[Fe]ZSM-5 materials, prepared by ion-exchange of Pt onto Na[Fe]ZSM-5, showed unprecedented rates and stability in the selective dehydrogenation of C2C4 alkanes."

[3] "These CsPt/Na[Fe]ZSM-5 samples gave much higher selectivities to linear pentenes (96%) than Pt/Na[Fe]ZSM-5 (28%)."

[4] "These materials catalyze dehydrogenation of larger n-alkanes with unprecedented rates and with very high selectivity to n-alkenes. The catalyst stability is excellent in comparison with catalytic materials in previous reports, which required much higher H2 pressures for stable operation."

The literature primarily focuses on platinum-based catalysts for alkane dehydrogenation, particularly Pt/Na[Fe]ZSM-5 and CsPt/Na[Fe]ZSM-5. It does not provide information on metal oxide-based catalysts like CrOx, gallium, indium, vanadium, zinc, and molybdenum oxides.

For platinum-based catalysts:

Composition: The catalysts described are Pt clusters supported on [Fe]ZSM-5 zeolites, modified with Na and Cs cations.

Effectiveness: These catalysts show high activity, selectivity, and stability for alkane dehydrogenation. They demonstrate unprecedented rates and very high selectivity to n-alkenes, especially for larger n-alkanes.

Industrial applications: The catalysts are used for dehydrogenation of n-alkanes to produce linear n-alkenes, which are important intermediates in the synthesis of chemicals like lubricants and detergent-range alkyl-aromatics.

Recent developments: The addition of Cs to Pt/Na[Fe]ZSM-5 significantly improved selectivity to linear alkenes and reduced side reactions like cracking and aromatization.

Potential advantages: These catalysts offer excellent stability at much lower H2 pressures than previously reported catalysts, and can even operate without H2. They also show higher rates and selectivities for larger alkanes like n-heptane compared to conventional catalysts.

The document does not provide information to compare these platinum-based catalysts with metal oxide-based catalysts for light olefin dehydrogenation.

这篇文献主要关注铂基催化剂在烷烃脱氢中的应用,特别是Pt/Na[Fe]ZSM-5和CsPt/Na[Fe]ZSM-5。文中并未提供有关金属氧化物基催化剂(如CrOx、镓、铟、钒、锌和钼氧化物)的信息。

对于铂基催化剂:

组成:所描述的催化剂是铂簇支撑在[Fe]ZSM-5分子筛上,并用Na和Cs阳离子进行改性。

有效性:这些催化剂在烷烃脱氢反应中表现出高活性、高选择性和高稳定性。它们展示了前所未有的反应速率和对直链烯烃的极高选择性,尤其是对于较大的直链烷烃。

工业应用:这些催化剂用于直链烷烃的脱氢反应,生产直链烯烃,这是合成润滑油和洗涤剂级烷基芳烃等化学品的重要中间体。

最新发展:在Pt/Na[Fe]ZSM-5中加入Cs显著提高了对直链烯烃的选择性,并减少了裂解和芳构化等副反应。

潜在优势:与之前报道的催化剂相比,这些催化剂在更低的氢气压力下表现出优异的稳定性,甚至可以在无氢气条件下运行。与传统催化剂相比,它们对较大的烷烃(如正庚烷)也表现出更高的反应速率和选择性。

文献中没有提供将这些铂基催化剂与金属氧化物基催化剂在轻质烯烃脱氢方面进行比较的信息。
