[1] "Pt-based catalysts are among the most active and selective for alkane dehydrogenation."

[2] "We previously reported that Pt/Na[Fe]ZSM-5 materials, prepared by ion-exchange of Pt onto Na[Fe]ZSM-5, showed unprecedented rates and stability in the selective dehydrogenation of C2C4 alkanes."

[3] "These CsPt/Na[Fe]ZSM-5 samples gave much higher selectivities to linear pentenes (96%) than Pt/Na[Fe]ZSM-5 (28%)."

[4] "Heptene formation rates (compared per Pt, because dispersion were not reported in the earlier study12) on CsPt/Na[Fe]ZSM-5 were almost ten-fold higher than on PtSn/Al2O3ClLi catalysts12 at similar conditions (Table 2)."

The literature primarily focuses on platinum-based catalysts for alkane dehydrogenation, particularly Pt supported on zeolites. It does not provide information about metal oxide-based catalysts like CrOx, gallium, indium, vanadium, zinc, and molybdenum oxides.

For Pt-based catalysts:

Composition: The study discusses Pt/Na[Fe]ZSM-5 and CsPt/Na[Fe]ZSM-5 catalysts. These are platinum supported on iron-containing zeolites, with sodium and cesium added as promoters.

Effectiveness: Pt-based catalysts are described as among the most active and selective for alkane dehydrogenation. The CsPt/Na[Fe]ZSM-5 catalyst showed high selectivity (96%) for linear pentenes and ten-fold higher heptene formation rates compared to a PtSn/Al2O3ClLi catalyst.

Recent developments: The addition of Cs to Pt/Na[Fe]ZSM-5 after reduction of Pt cations led to improved selectivity for linear alkenes and inhibition of skeletal isomerization and cracking side reactions.

Potential advantages: The catalysts showed high activity, selectivity, and stability even at low H2 pressures or without H2. They were effective for dehydrogenation of both light (C2-C4) and heavier (C5-C7) alkanes.

Industrial applications: While not explicitly stated, the high performance in n-pentane and n-heptane dehydrogenation suggests potential applications in the production of linear alkenes for use in chemicals and petrochemicals.

The document does not provide information to compare these Pt-based catalysts with metal oxide-based catalysts for light olefin dehydrogenation.

该文献主要关注铂基催化剂在烷烃脱氢中的应用,特别是铂负载在沸石上的催化剂。它没有提供关于金属氧化物基催化剂(如CrOx、镓、铟、钒、锌和钼氧化物)的信息。

对于铂基催化剂：

组成：研究讨论了Pt/Na[Fe]ZSM-5和CsPt/Na[Fe]ZSM-5催化剂。这些是铂负载在含铁沸石上的催化剂,添加了钠和铯作为助剂。

有效性：铂基催化剂被描述为烷烃脱氢反应中最活跃和选择性最高的催化剂之一。CsPt/Na[Fe]ZSM-5催化剂对直链戊烯表现出高选择性(96%),并且庚烯生成速率比PtSn/Al2O3ClLi催化剂高出10倍。

近期发展：在Pt/Na[Fe]ZSM-5还原铂阳离子后添加Cs,可以提高直链烯烃的选择性,并抑制骨架异构化和裂解副反应。

潜在优势：这些催化剂即使在低H2压力下或无H2条件下也表现出高活性、选择性和稳定性。它们对轻质(C2-C4)和重质(C5-C7)烷烃的脱氢都很有效。

工业应用：虽然没有明确说明,但在正戊烷和正庚烷脱氢中的高性能表明,这些催化剂在生产用于化学品和石油化学品的直链烯烃方面具有潜在应用。

该文献没有提供将这些铂基催化剂与金属氧化物基催化剂在轻质烯烃脱氢中进行比较的信息。
