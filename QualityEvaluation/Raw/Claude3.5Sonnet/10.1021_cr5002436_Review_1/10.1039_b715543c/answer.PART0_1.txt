[1] "Pt-based catalysts are among the most active and selective for alkane dehydrogenation."

[2] "We previously reported that Pt/Na[Fe]ZSM-5 materials, prepared by ion-exchange of Pt onto Na[Fe]ZSM-5, showed unprecedented rates and stability in the selective dehydrogenation of C2C4 alkanes."

[3] "These CsPt/Na[Fe]ZSM-5 samples gave much higher selectivities to linear pentenes (96%) than Pt/Na[Fe]ZSM-5 (28%)."

[4] "These materials catalyze dehydrogenation of larger n-alkanes with unprecedented rates and with very high selectivity to n-alkenes. The catalyst stability is excellent in comparison with catalytic materials in previous reports, which required much higher H2 pressures for stable operation."

The literature focuses primarily on platinum-based catalysts for alkane dehydrogenation, particularly Pt/Na[Fe]ZSM-5 and CsPt/Na[Fe]ZSM-5. It does not provide information on metal oxide-based catalysts like CrOx, gallium, indium, vanadium, zinc, and molybdenum oxides.

For platinum-based catalysts:

Composition: The catalysts discussed are Pt clusters supported on [Fe]ZSM-5 zeolites, modified with Na and Cs cations.

Effectiveness: These catalysts show high activity and selectivity for alkane dehydrogenation. CsPt/Na[Fe]ZSM-5 demonstrates particularly high selectivity (96%) for linear pentenes.

Industrial applications: The catalysts are used for dehydrogenation of n-alkanes to produce linear n-alkenes, which are important intermediates in the synthesis of chemicals like lubricants and detergent-range alkylaromatics.

Recent developments: The addition of Cs to Pt/Na[Fe]ZSM-5 after reduction of Pt cations leads to improved selectivity for linear alkenes and excellent catalyst stability.

Potential advantages: These catalysts offer unprecedented rates and high selectivity for n-alkene formation, with excellent stability even at low H2 pressures. They are effective for both light (C2-C4) and larger (C5-C7) alkanes.

The literature does not provide information to compare these platinum-based catalysts with metal oxide-based catalysts for light olefin dehydrogenation.

该文献主要关注铂基催化剂在烷烃脱氢中的应用，特别是Pt/Na[Fe]ZSM-5和CsPt/Na[Fe]ZSM-5。它没有提供关于金属氧化物基催化剂（如CrOx、镓、铟、钒、锌和钼氧化物）的信息。

对于铂基催化剂：

组成：讨论的催化剂是负载在[Fe]ZSM-5分子筛上的Pt簇，经Na和Cs阳离子修饰。

有效性：这些催化剂在烷烃脱氢反应中表现出高活性和选择性。CsPt/Na[Fe]ZSM-5对直链戊烯表现出特别高的选择性（96%）。

工业应用：这些催化剂用于正烷烃的脱氢以生产直链正烯烃，这些烯烃是合成润滑油和洗涤剂级烷基芳烃等化学品的重要中间体。

最新发展：在Pt阳离子还原后向Pt/Na[Fe]ZSM-5中添加Cs，可以提高直链烯烃的选择性和催化剂的稳定性。

潜在优势：这些催化剂具有前所未有的反应速率和对正烯烃生成的高选择性，即使在低H2压力下也具有优异的稳定性。它们对于轻质（C2-C4）和较大（C5-C7）烷烃都有效。

该文献没有提供将这些铂基催化剂与金属氧化物基催化剂在轻质烯烃脱氢方面进行比较的信息。
