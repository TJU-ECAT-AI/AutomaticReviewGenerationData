[1] "Pt-based catalysts are among the most active and selective for alkane dehydrogenation."

[2] "Pt/Na[Fe]ZSM-5 materials, prepared by ion-exchange of Pt onto Na[Fe]ZSM-5, showed unprecedented rates and stability in the selective dehydrogenation of C2C4 alkanes."

[3] "CsPt/Na[Fe]ZSM-5 samples gave much higher selectivities to linear pentenes (96%) than Pt/Na[Fe]ZSM-5 (28%)."

[4] "These materials catalyze dehydrogenation of larger n-alkanes with unprecedented rates and with very high selectivity to n-alkenes. The catalyst stability is excellent in comparison with catalytic materials in previous reports, which required much higher H2 pressures for stable operation."

The literature primarily focuses on platinum-based catalysts for alkane dehydrogenation, particularly Pt/Na[Fe]ZSM-5 and CsPt/Na[Fe]ZSM-5. It does not provide information on metal oxide-based catalysts like CrOx, gallium, indium, vanadium, zinc, and molybdenum oxides.

For platinum-based catalysts:

Composition: The catalysts discussed are Pt clusters supported on [Fe]ZSM-5 zeolites, modified with Na and Cs cations.

Effectiveness: These catalysts show high activity and selectivity for alkane dehydrogenation. CsPt/Na[Fe]ZSM-5 demonstrated higher selectivity to linear pentenes (96%) compared to Pt/Na[Fe]ZSM-5 (28%).

Recent developments: The addition of Cs to Pt/Na[Fe]ZSM-5 after reduction of Pt cations led to improved selectivity for linear alkenes and excellent catalyst stability.

Potential advantages: These catalysts offer unprecedented rates and high selectivity for n-alkene formation from larger n-alkanes. They also demonstrate excellent stability compared to previous catalysts, requiring lower H2 pressures for stable operation.

The document does not provide information to compare these platinum-based catalysts with metal oxide-based catalysts or discuss their industrial applications in detail. Therefore, a comprehensive comparison cannot be made based solely on this literature.

该文献主要关注铂基催化剂在烷烃脱氢反应中的应用，特别是Pt/Na[Fe]ZSM-5和CsPt/Na[Fe]ZSM-5。它没有提供关于金属氧化物基催化剂（如CrOx、镓、铟、钒、锌和钼氧化物）的信息。

对于铂基催化剂：

成分：讨论的催化剂是负载在[Fe]ZSM-5分子筛上的Pt簇，并用Na和Cs阳离子进行了改性。

有效性：这些催化剂在烷烃脱氢反应中表现出高活性和选择性。CsPt/Na[Fe]ZSM-5对直链戊烯的选择性（96%）明显高于Pt/Na[Fe]ZSM-5（28%）。

最新发展：在Pt阳离子还原后向Pt/Na[Fe]ZSM-5中添加Cs，导致对直链烯烃的选择性提高，并具有优异的催化剂稳定性。

潜在优势：这些催化剂在大分子量正构烷烃转化为正构烯烃的反应中表现出前所未有的反应速率和高选择性。与之前的催化剂相比，它们还表现出优异的稳定性，在较低的H2压力下也能稳定运行。

该文献没有提供足够的信息来比较这些铂基催化剂与金属氧化物基催化剂，也没有详细讨论它们的工业应用。因此，仅基于这篇文献无法进行全面的比较。
