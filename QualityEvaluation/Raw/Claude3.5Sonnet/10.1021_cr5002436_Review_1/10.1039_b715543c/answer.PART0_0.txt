[1] "Pt-based catalysts are among the most active and selective for alkane dehydrogenation."

[2] "Pt/Na[Fe]ZSM-5 materials, prepared by ion-exchange of Pt onto Na[Fe]ZSM-5, showed unprecedented rates and stability in the selective dehydrogenation of C2C4 alkanes."

[3] "CsPt/Na[Fe]ZSM-5 samples gave much higher selectivities to linear pentenes (96%) than Pt/Na[Fe]ZSM-5 (28%)."

[4] "These materials catalyze dehydrogenation of larger n-alkanes with unprecedented rates and with very high selectivity to n-alkenes. The catalyst stability is excellent in comparison with catalytic materials in previous reports, which required much higher H2 pressures for stable operation."

The literature focuses primarily on platinum-based catalysts for alkane dehydrogenation, particularly Pt/Na[Fe]ZSM-5 and CsPt/Na[Fe]ZSM-5. It does not provide information on metal oxide-based catalysts like CrOx, gallium, indium, vanadium, zinc, and molybdenum oxides.

For platinum-based catalysts:

Composition: The catalysts discussed are Pt clusters supported on [Fe]ZSM-5 zeolites, modified with Na and Cs cations.

Effectiveness: These catalysts show high activity and selectivity for alkane dehydrogenation. CsPt/Na[Fe]ZSM-5 demonstrated particularly high selectivity (96%) for linear pentenes.

Recent developments: The addition of Cs to Pt/Na[Fe]ZSM-5 after reduction of Pt cations led to improved selectivity and stability, especially for larger alkanes like n-heptane.

Potential advantages: These catalysts offer high rates, excellent stability, and high selectivity to linear alkenes. They operate effectively at lower H2 pressures compared to previous catalysts, making them promising for industrial applications.

The document does not provide information to compare these platinum-based catalysts with metal oxide-based catalysts for light olefin dehydrogenation. To fully answer the question, additional information on metal oxide catalysts would be needed.

该文献主要关注用于烷烃脱氢的铂基催化剂，特别是Pt/Na[Fe]ZSM-5和CsPt/Na[Fe]ZSM-5。它没有提供关于金属氧化物基催化剂（如CrOx、镓、铟、钒、锌和钼氧化物）的信息。

对于铂基催化剂：

成分：所讨论的催化剂是负载在[Fe]ZSM-5沸石上的Pt簇，用Na和Cs阳离子进行了改性。

有效性：这些催化剂对烷烃脱氢表现出高活性和选择性。CsPt/Na[Fe]ZSM-5对直链戊烯表现出特别高的选择性（96%）。

最新发展：在Pt阳离子还原后向Pt/Na[Fe]ZSM-5中添加Cs，导致选择性和稳定性提高，特别是对于较大的烷烃（如正庚烷）。

潜在优势：这些催化剂具有高反应速率、优异的稳定性和对直链烯烃的高选择性。与以前的催化剂相比，它们在较低的H2压力下也能有效运行，使其在工业应用中具有潜力。

该文档没有提供比较这些铂基催化剂与金属氧化物基催化剂在轻质烯烃脱氢方面的信息。要全面回答这个问题，需要有关金属氧化物催化剂的额外信息。
