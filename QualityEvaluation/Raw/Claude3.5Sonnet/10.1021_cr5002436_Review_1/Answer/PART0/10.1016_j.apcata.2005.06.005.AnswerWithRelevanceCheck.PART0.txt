          [1] "The PtZn system resembles in some aspects the PtSn system. Platinum and zinc can also form alloy phases of different stoichiometries (PtZn, Pt3Zn, among others), which may show distinctive catalytic behaviour as compared to monometallic platinum."

[2] "For example, it has been reported that Pt/ZnO catalysts can achieve 99% selectivity at 45% conversion in the dehydrogenation of iso-butane to iso-butene at 723 K [23]."

[3] "The bimetallic catalyst, with a bulk Zn/Pt atomic ratio of 13.7, showed a much higher initial activity in crotonaldehyde hydrogenation, although it deactivated more strongly with time on stream."

[4] "On the other hand, the catalytic behaviour for iso-butane dehydrogenation was greatly improved by the presence of zinc, the bimetallic catalyst being more active than its monometallic counterpart and showing 100% selectivity to iso-butene."

[5] "The modification of the catalytic behaviour of a noble metal through the addition of a second non-active metal able to form alloy phases or intermetallic compounds with the former is an interesting field in heterogeneous catalysis."

          The literature primarily focuses on platinum-based catalysts, particularly Pt-Zn systems, for dehydrogenation reactions. It does not provide comprehensive information on metal oxide-based catalysts like CrOx, gallium, indium, vanadium, zinc, and molybdenum oxides for comparison.

For platinum-based catalysts:

1. Composition: The study discusses Pt-Zn bimetallic catalysts, which can form alloy phases like PtZn and Pt3Zn. The modification of noble metals with a second non-active metal to form alloy phases or intermetallic compounds is highlighted as an interesting field in heterogeneous catalysis.

2. Effectiveness: Pt-Zn catalysts show improved performance compared to monometallic Pt catalysts. For iso-butane dehydrogenation, a Pt/ZnO catalyst achieved 99% selectivity at 45% conversion at 723 K. The bimetallic Pt-Zn catalyst showed higher activity and 100% selectivity to iso-butene compared to the monometallic Pt catalyst.

3. Industrial applications: The catalysts were tested for iso-butane dehydrogenation to produce iso-butene and crotonaldehyde hydrogenation. The paper also mentions the use of platinum-tin systems in naphtha reforming and alkane dehydrogenation reactions.

4. Recent developments: The study explored the modification of Pt catalysts with Zn to enhance their catalytic behavior, focusing on the formation of PtZn alloy phases and their impact on catalyst performance.

5. Potential advantages: Pt-Zn catalysts offer higher selectivity and activity in dehydrogenation reactions compared to monometallic Pt catalysts. The addition of zinc to platinum enhances selectivity and activity, particularly for iso-butane to iso-butene conversion.

The literature does not provide sufficient information to compare these platinum-based catalysts with metal oxide-based catalysts for light olefin dehydrogenation. To fully answer the question, additional sources would be needed to discuss CrOx, gallium, indium, vanadium, zinc, and molybdenum oxide catalysts in the context of light olefin dehydrogenation.

          该文献主要关注铂基催化剂，特别是Pt-Zn系统在脱氢反应中的应用。它没有提供关于CrOx、镓、铟、钒、锌和钼氧化物等金属氧化物基催化剂的全面信息以供比较。

对于铂基催化剂：

1. 组成：研究讨论了Pt-Zn双金属催化剂，它们可以形成PtZn和Pt3Zn等合金相。研究强调了通过添加第二种非活性金属来改变贵金属的催化行为，形成合金相或金属间化合物，这是异相催化领域的一个有趣方向。

2. 有效性：与单金属Pt催化剂相比，Pt-Zn催化剂表现出更好的性能。在异丁烷脱氢反应中，Pt/ZnO催化剂在723 K下实现了45%转化率时99%的选择性。双金属Pt-Zn催化剂与单金属Pt催化剂相比，显示出更高的活性和100%的异丁烯选择性。

3. 工业应用：这些催化剂被用于异丁烷脱氢生产异丁烯和巴豆醛加氢反应的测试。文章还提到了铂-锡系统在石脑油重整和烷烃脱氢反应中的应用。

4. 最新发展：研究探索了用Zn改性Pt催化剂以增强其催化行为，重点关注PtZn合金相的形成及其对催化剂性能的影响。

5. 潜在优势：与单金属Pt催化剂相比，Pt-Zn催化剂在脱氢反应中提供更高的选择性和活性。向铂中添加锌可以提高选择性和活性，特别是在异丁烷到异丁烯的转化中。

该文献没有提供足够的信息来比较这些铂基催化剂与金属氧化物基催化剂在轻烯烃脱氢反应中的性能。要全面回答这个问题，还需要额外的资料来讨论CrOx、镓、铟、钒、锌和钼氧化物催化剂在轻烯烃脱氢背景下的情况。
