          [1] "Supported platinum (Pt)tin (Sn) catalysts have been widely used in naphtha reforming or alkane dehydrogenation processes due to their high selectivity and stability"

          [2] "Nowadays, several studies are being carried out to evaluate the modification of the stability, selectivity and activity of the metallic catalysts by the addition of some alkali metals such as Li, Ba, K and Ca in PtSn/Al2O3 catalyst."

          [3] "The incorporation of Sn and Li improved light-paraffin dehydrogenation and inhibited isomerization and cracking reactions"

          The literature primarily focuses on platinum-based catalysts, particularly PtSn catalysts supported on alumina, for the dehydrogenation of light olefins. It does not provide comprehensive information on metal oxide-based catalysts like CrOx, gallium, indium, vanadium, zinc, and molybdenum oxides.

          For platinum-based catalysts:

          Composition: The main catalysts discussed are PtSn supported on γ-Al2O3, with additions of alkali metals like K and Li as promoters.

          Effectiveness: These catalysts show high selectivity and stability for alkane dehydrogenation processes. The addition of Sn to Pt increases catalyst stability, decreases deactivation rate, and improves selectivity by inhibiting side reactions.

          Industrial applications: They are widely used in naphtha reforming and alkane dehydrogenation processes.

          Recent developments: Research is ongoing to modify these catalysts by adding alkali metals (Li, Ba, K, Ca) to further improve stability, selectivity, and activity. The incorporation of Sn and Li has been shown to improve light-paraffin dehydrogenation while inhibiting isomerization and cracking reactions.

          The literature does not provide information to compare these platinum-based catalysts with metal oxide-based catalysts or discuss their relative advantages in the field of nonoxidative dehydrogenation of light olefins.

          这篇文献主要关注铂基催化剂，特别是在氧化铝上负载的PtSn催化剂，用于轻烯烃的脱氢。它没有提供关于金属氧化物基催化剂（如CrOx、镓、铟、钒、锌和钼氧化物）的全面信息。

          对于铂基催化剂：

          组成：主要讨论的催化剂是在γ-Al2O3上负载的PtSn，并添加了K和Li等碱金属作为助剂。

          有效性：这些催化剂在烷烃脱氢过程中表现出高选择性和稳定性。向Pt中添加Sn可以提高催化剂的稳定性，降低失活率，并通过抑制副反应来提高选择性。

          工业应用：它们广泛用于石脑油重整和烷烃脱氢过程。

          最新发展：目前正在进行研究，通过添加碱金属（Li、Ba、K、Ca）来进一步改善这些催化剂的稳定性、选择性和活性。研究表明，添加Sn和Li可以改善轻质石蜡的脱氢，同时抑制异构化和裂化反应。

          文献没有提供将这些铂基催化剂与金属氧化物基催化剂进行比较的信息，也没有讨论它们在轻烯烃非氧化脱氢领域的相对优势。
