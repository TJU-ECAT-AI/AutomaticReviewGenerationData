          [1] "Dehydrogenation employs chromia-alumina catalysts and, more recently, platinum or modified platinum catalysts."

[2] "A different approach to catalytic dehydrogenation was first introduced in the mid-1960s for the supply of long-chain linear olefins for the production of biodegradable detergents."

[3] "In the early 1970s, UOP introduced continuous catalyst regeneration (CCR) technology that enabled noble metal catalysts to remain at their most desirable stable activity for several years without having to shut down the reactor for catalyst regeneration."

[4] "The work on catalytic reforming with noble metal (Pt) catalysts done in the 1940s by Haensel clearly demonstrated that Pt-based catalysts had high activity for the dehydrogenation of paraffins to the corresponding olefins"

[5] "Nakagawa et al. [63] studied a series of metal oxides for ethane dehydrogenation in the presence of CO2 at 650 C, C2H6:CO2 = 5:25 ml/min and SV = 900 h1 ml (g-cat)1. The order of activity was as follows: Ga2O3 > Cr2O3 > V2O5 > TiO2 > Mn3O4 > In2O3 > ZnO > La2O3."

[6] "The key role of dehydrogenation catalysts is to accelerate the main reaction while controlling other reactions. Unmodified alumina-supported platinum catalysts are highly active but are not selective to dehydrogenation."

[7] "The role of platinum modifiers is to weaken the platinumolefin interaction selectively without affecting the platinumparaffin interaction. Arsenic, tin, germanium, lead, bismuth are among metals reported as platinum activity modifiers."

[8] "Bloch [10] further extended this thinking by developing Pt-based catalysts that could selectively dehydrogenate long-chain linear paraffins to the corresponding internal mono-olefins with high activity and stability and with minimum cracking."

[9] "Particularly, notable for its high selectivity to propylene is a vanadia-silica-zirconia catalyst of Rulkens and Tilley at the University of California, Berkley, CA [75]. These workers using a molecular precursor route, produced an 18/36/46 V2O5-SiO2-ZrO2 catalyst which gave 81.5% selectivity to propylene at 8% conversion of propane at 550 C."

[10] "Wang et al. [64] of Japan studied the effect of sulfate and Na-treatment silica on the dehydrogenation of ethane with CO2 at 650 C and 1 atm. Sulfating silica (348 m2/g) with (NH4)2SO4 (and calcining at 700 C/3 h to give 2 wt.% SO42), and adding 5 wt.% Cr gave the best catalytic performance."

          Noble metal-based catalysts (particularly platinum) and metal oxide-based catalysts have different compositions, effectiveness, industrial applications, recent developments, and potential advantages in the nonoxidative dehydrogenation of light olefins:

Composition:
- Noble metal catalysts: Primarily platinum-based, often modified with elements like arsenic, tin, germanium, lead, or bismuth, and supported on alumina.
- Metal oxide catalysts: Include chromia-alumina, gallium oxide, chromium oxide, vanadium oxide, titanium oxide, manganese oxide, indium oxide, zinc oxide, and lanthanum oxide. Complex mixed oxides like vanadia-silica-zirconia are also used.

Effectiveness:
- Noble metal catalysts: Generally more effective, with high activity and selectivity for dehydrogenation, especially for long-chain paraffins. However, unmodified platinum catalysts may lack selectivity.
- Metal oxide catalysts: Vary in effectiveness, with gallium oxide showing the highest activity among simple metal oxides. Some complex oxides, like vanadia-silica-zirconia, show high selectivity for specific reactions.

Industrial applications:
- Noble metal catalysts: Widely used in commercial processes like UOP's Oleflex and Pacol for light and heavy paraffin dehydrogenation, particularly for long-chain linear olefins production.
- Metal oxide catalysts: Chromia-alumina catalysts have been used in older processes like Catofin. Other metal oxides are still in research stages for potential industrial applications.

Recent developments:
- Noble metal catalysts: Introduction of continuous catalyst regeneration (CCR) technology, allowing for stable activity over several years. Focus on modifications to improve selectivity and stability.
- Metal oxide catalysts: Research into novel combinations and supports to enhance performance, such as sulfate and sodium treatments of silica supports, and development of complex mixed oxide systems.

Potential advantages:
- Noble metal catalysts: High activity, long-term stability with CCR, flexibility for different feedstocks, and well-established in industrial processes.
- Metal oxide catalysts: Potentially lower cost, good selectivity for specific reactions, ability to be tailored for different feedstocks, and in some cases, effectiveness in the presence of CO2 as a mild oxidant.

Overall, while platinum-based catalysts dominate industrial applications due to their superior performance, research continues on metal oxide catalysts to find more cost-effective and equally efficient alternatives for specific dehydrogenation processes.
