          [1] "The introduction of Ga (123), Zn (2436), and Pt (3743) species into H-ZSM5 increases the rate and selectivity of aromatization reactions and inhibits β-scission side reactions that lead to undesirable products."

[2] "Zn cations decrease β-scission rates and the residence time of alkenes within oligomerization/β-scission cycles, leading to higher rates and selectivity for the synthesis of C6-C8 aromatic products."

[3] "Zn cations promote not only alkane dehydrogenation, but also the subsequent removal of hydrogen as H2, leading to unsaturated intermediates required in cyclization steps."

[4] "Zn cations act as portholes (68) for the desorption of H-atoms; as a result, they also increase the reverse reaction, the dissociative chemisorption of dihydrogen"

[5] "Modifications of pentasil zeolites with exchanged Zn cations increase turnover rates, aromatic site-time yields, and the rate of hydrogen disposal during ethane, propane, and propene aromatization."

[6] "As Zn cations increase the rate (and reversibility) of adsorptiondesorption steps, surface hydrogen concentrations and the extent of dehydrogenation of adsorbed intermediates begin to reflect not only the rate at which hydrogen forms in C-H bond activation steps, but also the rate at which it is introduced into the surface via dissociative chemisorption steps involving H2 in the gas phase."

          The literature does not provide a comprehensive comparison of noble metal-based catalysts and metal oxide-based catalysts for light olefin dehydrogenation. However, it offers some insights into the role of zinc and platinum in aromatization reactions, which are related to dehydrogenation processes:

1. Composition: The study focuses on Zn/H-ZSM5 catalysts, where zinc cations are introduced into the H-ZSM5 zeolite structure. It also mentions the introduction of Ga and Pt species.

2. Effectiveness:
   - Both Zn and Pt species, when introduced into H-ZSM5, increase the rate and selectivity of aromatization reactions while inhibiting undesirable β-scission side reactions.
   - Zinc cations specifically:
     a) Decrease β-scission rates and reduce the residence time of alkenes in oligomerization/β-scission cycles.
     b) Increase rates and selectivity for C6-C8 aromatic products.
     c) Promote alkane dehydrogenation and subsequent removal of hydrogen as H2.
     d) Lead to the formation of unsaturated intermediates needed for cyclization.
     e) Increase turnover rates, aromatic site-time yields, and hydrogen disposal rates during ethane, propane, and propene aromatization.

3. Mechanism:
   - Zinc cations act as "portholes" for hydrogen desorption, facilitating the removal of hydrogen atoms as H2.
   - They increase the rate and reversibility of adsorption-desorption steps, affecting surface hydrogen concentrations and the extent of dehydrogenation of adsorbed intermediates.

4. Advantages: Zn/H-ZSM5 catalysts decrease β-scission rates and the residence time of alkenes within oligomerization/β-scission cycles, which reduces undesirable side reactions.

The document does not provide information on industrial applications, recent developments, or comparisons with other metal oxide catalysts (such as CrOx, gallium, indium, vanadium, or molybdenum oxides) or a direct comparison with noble metal-based catalysts like platinum. Therefore, a comprehensive comparison cannot be made based solely on this literature, and additional sources would be needed to fully address the question's scope.

          该文献并未提供关于贵金属基催化剂和金属氧化物基催化剂用于轻质烯烃脱氢的全面比较。然而，它确实提供了一些关于锌和铂在芳构化反应中的作用的见解，这些反应与脱氢过程有关：

1. 组成：研究主要集中在Zn/H-ZSM5催化剂上，其中锌阳离子被引入H-ZSM5沸石结构中。它还提到了引入Ga和Pt物种。

2. 有效性：
   - 锌和铂物种当引入H-ZSM5时，都能增加芳构化反应的速率和选择性，同时抑制不良的β-裂解副反应。
   - 锌阳离子具体地：
     a) 降低β-裂解速率，减少烯烃在低聚/β-裂解循环中的停留时间。
     b) 提高C6-C8芳烃产品的生成速率和选择性。
     c) 促进烷烃脱氢和随后以H2形式去除氢。
     d) 导致形成环化所需的不饱和中间体。
     e) 在乙烷、丙烷和丙烯芳构化过程中提高转化率、芳烃场-时产率和氢处理速率。

3. 机理：
   - 锌阳离子充当氢脱附的"门户"，促进氢原子以H2的形式去除。
   - 它们增加了吸附-脱附步骤的速率和可逆性，影响表面氢浓度和吸附中间体的脱氢程度。

4. 优势：Zn/H-ZSM5催化剂降低了β-裂解速率和烯烃在寡聚/β-裂解循环中的停留时间，从而减少了不良副反应。

该文件没有提供关于工业应用、最新发展或与其他金属氧化物催化剂（如CrOx、镓、铟、钒或钼氧化物）的比较信息，也没有与贵金属基催化剂（如铂）进行直接比较。因此，仅基于这篇文献无法进行全面比较，需要额外的信息来源才能全面回答这个问题的范围。
