It does not provide information on metal oxide-based catalysts like CrOx, gallium, indium, vanadium, zinc, and molybdenum oxides.\n\nFor platinum-based catalysts:\n\nComposition: The catalysts discussed are Pt clusters supported on [Fe]ZSM-5 zeolites, modified with Na and Cs cations.\n\nEffectiveness: These catalysts show high activity and selectivity for alkane dehydrogenation. CsPt/Na[Fe]ZSM-5 demonstrated particularly high selectivity (96%) for linear pentenes compared to Pt/Na[Fe]ZSM-5 (28%). They also showed ten-fold higher heptene formation rates compared to PtSn/Al2O3ClLi catalysts.\n\nIndustrial applications: The catalysts are used for dehydrogenation of n-alkanes to produce linear n-alkenes, which are important intermediates in the synthesis of chemicals like lubricants and detergent-range alkylaromatics.\n\nRecent developments: The addition of Cs to Pt/Na[Fe]ZSM-5 after reduction of Pt cations leads to improved selectivity for linear alkenes and excellent catalyst stability. It also inhibits skeletal isomerization and cracking side reactions.\n\nPotential advantages: These catalysts offer unprecedented rates and high selectivity for n-alkene formation, with excellent stability even at low H2 pressures or without H2. They are effective for both light (C2-C4) and larger (C5-C7) alkanes, showing higher rates and selectivities compared to conventional catalysts.\n\nThe literature does not provide information to compare these platinum-based catalysts with metal oxide-based catalysts for light olefin dehydrogenation. Therefore, a comprehensive comparison between noble metal-based and metal oxide-based catalysts cannot be made based solely on this information.", "Doi": "10.1039/b715543c"},
