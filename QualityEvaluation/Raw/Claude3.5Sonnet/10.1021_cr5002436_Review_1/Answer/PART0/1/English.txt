The literature primarily focuses on platinum-based catalysts for propane dehydrogenation, with limited information on metal oxide-based catalysts. Key points include:

          Composition: The study discusses monometallic Pt catalysts supported on SBA-15, PtSn bimetallic catalysts, and briefly mentions Cr-based catalysts. There is no information on other metal oxide catalysts like gallium, indium, vanadium, zinc, or molybdenum oxides.

          Effectiveness: Platinum-based catalysts are effective for propane dehydrogenation. The effectiveness depends on particle size, with smaller Pt particles (3 nm) being more active but less selective than larger particles (21 nm). PtSn bimetallic catalysts show improved characteristics compared to monometallic Pt catalysts.

          Industrial applications: Both Pt- and Cr-based catalysts are used in commercial dehydrogenation plants.

          Recent developments: The study presents new findings on the effect of Pt particle size on catalytic performance in propane dehydrogenation. Smaller Pt particles are more active but less selective and prone to higher coking rates.

          The literature does not provide sufficient information to compare the potential advantages of Pt-based catalysts versus metal oxide catalysts for light olefin dehydrogenation. A more comprehensive study would be needed to fully address the question and compare noble metal-based catalysts with various metal oxide-based catalysts.

The literature does not provide a comprehensive comparison of noble metal-based catalysts and metal oxide-based catalysts for light olefin dehydrogenation. However, it offers some insights into the role of zinc and platinum in aromatization reactions, which are related to dehydrogenation processes:

1. Composition: The study focuses on Zn/H-ZSM5 catalysts, where zinc cations are introduced into the H-ZSM5 zeolite structure. It also mentions the introduction of Ga and Pt species.

2. Effectiveness:
   - Both Zn and Pt species, when introduced into H-ZSM5, increase the rate and selectivity of aromatization reactions while inhibiting undesirable β-scission side reactions.
   - Zinc cations specifically:
     a) Decrease β-scission rates and reduce the residence time of alkenes in oligomerization/β-scission cycles.
     b) Increase rates and selectivity for C6-C8 aromatic products.
     c) Promote alkane dehydrogenation and subsequent removal of hydrogen as H2.
     d) Lead to the formation of unsaturated intermediates needed for cyclization.
     e) Increase turnover rates, aromatic site-time yields, and hydrogen disposal rates during ethane, propane, and propene aromatization.

3. Mechanism:
   - Zinc cations act as "portholes" for hydrogen desorption, facilitating the removal of hydrogen atoms as H2.
   - They increase the rate and reversibility of adsorption-desorption steps, affecting surface hydrogen concentrations and the extent of dehydrogenation of adsorbed intermediates.

4. Advantages: Zn/H-ZSM5 catalysts decrease β-scission rates and the residence time of alkenes within oligomerization/β-scission cycles, which reduces undesirable side reactions.

- Both types may face deactivation issues, particularly coke formation.

In summary, while platinum-based catalysts dominate the discussion due to their widespread industrial use and extensive research, metal oxide catalysts are acknowledged as an alternative. However, the text provides limited information for a comprehensive comparison of their relative advantages in the field.

The literature primarily focuses on noble metal-based catalysts, particularly platinum, for the nonoxidative dehydrogenation of light olefins. It does not provide a comprehensive comparison with metal oxide-based catalysts like CrOx, gallium, indium, vanadium, zinc, and molybdenum oxides.

For platinum-based catalysts:

The literature does not provide information on industrial applications or comparisons with metal oxide-based catalysts for this specific reaction. To fully answer the question, additional information from other sources would be needed, especially regarding metal oxide-based catalysts and their industrial applications.

The provided literature focuses primarily on platinum-tin (PtSn) catalysts for alkane dehydrogenation, particularly isobutane dehydrogenation. It does not contain comprehensive information about metal oxide-based catalysts like CrOx, gallium, indium, vanadium, zinc, and molybdenum oxides, making a full comparison impossible.

          For platinum-based catalysts:

          Composition: The catalysts discussed are PtSn supported on γ-Al2O3, with some also containing alkaline metals (Li, Na, K) as modifiers.

          Effectiveness: Tin is described as the most widely used modifier for platinum in alkane dehydrogenation catalysts. It increases selectivity to olefins and improves catalyst stability. PtSn catalysts show higher selectivity to olefins and improved stability compared to platinum alone.

          Preparation: Surface Organometallic Chemistry on Metals (SOMC/M) techniques are used to prepare these catalysts, resulting in stable and highly dispersed bimetallic systems.

          Advantages: Tin helps inhibit cracking reactions and decreases the deactivation rate by reducing coke formation or modifying the nature of the coke formed. The addition of alkaline metals to the alumina support helps neutralize acid sites, which can decrease the formation of undesired linear hydrocarbons.

          The document does not provide information to compare these platinum-based catalysts with metal oxide-based catalysts for light olefin dehydrogenation, nor does it discuss their relative industrial applications or recent developments in the field.

          Effectiveness: Bimetallic Pt-Sn and Pt-Pb catalysts are proposed as improvements over monometallic Pt/Al2O3 reforming catalysts. However, increasing amounts of Pb or Sn decrease the catalytic activity for cyclohexane dehydrogenation. Small amounts of Sn have a stronger poisoning effect than Pb.

          Mechanism: The addition of Pb or Sn modifies Pt through a ligand effect, influencing its adsorption capacity. With increasing amounts of Pb or Sn, weak hydrogen adsorption decreases while oxygen adsorption increases. Electronic interactions between Pt and Sn, as well as Pt and Pb, have been observed through spectroscopic investigations.

The literature primarily focuses on platinum-based catalysts supported on zinc aluminate for light olefin dehydrogenation, rather than providing a comprehensive comparison of noble metal and metal oxide catalysts. However, some insights can be drawn:

1. Composition: The study examines platinum supported on zinc aluminate (Pt/ZnAl2O4) catalysts. It mentions that these spinel-type structures are being investigated as alternatives to traditional Cr2O3/Al2O3 catalysts.

2. Effectiveness: The Pt/ZnAl2O4 catalysts show promising results for isobutane dehydrogenation, with high selectivity (up to 97%) and activity, especially when hydrogen is used as a reaction medium.

The literature primarily focuses on noble metal-based catalysts, particularly platinum, for the nonoxidative dehydrogenation of light olefins. It does not provide a comprehensive comparison with metal oxide-based catalysts like CrOx, gallium, indium, vanadium, zinc, and molybdenum oxides.

Composition: Platinum-based catalysts are typically promoted with elements such as Sn, Zn, Ge, Ga, or In to form bimetallic alloys. These catalysts are often supported on calcined hydrotalcite-like materials such as Mg(Al)O, Mg(Ga)(Al)O, or Mg(In)(Al)O.

Effectiveness: Platinum is described as the most effective transition metal for alkane dehydrogenation. The bimetallic alloys, particularly PtIn and PtGa, show high activity and selectivity for ethane and propane dehydrogenation. For ethane dehydrogenation, Pt/Mg(In)(Al)O, Pt/Mg(Ga)(Al)O, and PtSn/Mg(Al)O exhibit comparable activities and selectivities. For propane dehydrogenation, the activity order is Pt/Mg(In)(Al)O > Pt/Mg(Ga)(Al)O > PtSn/Mg(Al)O > PtGa/Mg(Al)O > Pt/Mg(Al)O.

These catalysts showed improved performance compared to other Pt-based catalysts, with high activity, selectivity, and reduced carbon deposition.

Potential advantages: The bimetallic nanoparticles produce less coke, which helps prevent catalyst deactivation. PtIn catalysts are more homogeneous in composition than PtSn particles and stable for dehydrogenation of C4 and C5 alkanes. The calcined hydrotalcite-like supports help stabilize the dispersed metal particles against sintering. The ability to tune catalyst properties by adjusting the promoter/Pt ratio (e.g., In/Pt) allows for optimization of catalyst performance.

The literature provides information on noble metal-based catalysts (particularly Platinum) and some metal oxide-based catalysts used in the nonoxidative dehydrogenation of light olefins, though it does not cover all the metal oxides mentioned in the question.

Compositions: Noble metal catalysts typically use platinum, often promoted with other metals like tin (PtSn). Metal oxide catalysts mentioned include chromium oxide (Cr2O3) and gallium oxide (in Ga/H-ZSM5).

Supports: Both types of catalysts use various supports. For noble metals, supports include alumina, silica, various zeolites (ZSM5, L-zeolite, Y-zeolite, MOR, Beta), SBA-15, and Mg(Al)O. For metal oxides, alumina and zirconia are mentioned as supports for Cr2O3.

The literature primarily focuses on platinum-based catalysts for ethane dehydrogenation, particularly platinum-tin (PtSn) bimetallic catalysts. It does not provide a comprehensive comparison with metal oxide-based catalysts. However, based on the information provided, we can discuss some aspects of platinum-based catalysts:

1. Composition: The catalysts discussed are primarily platinum-based, often modified with a second metal such as tin, indium, or gallium. The specific focus is on PtSn nanoparticles supported on Mg(Al)O (calcined hydrotalcite).

2. Effectiveness: Platinum is described as the most active catalyst for ethane dehydrogenation. However, pure platinum has low ethene selectivity and suffers from rapid coke deposition, leading to deactivation. The addition of a second metal, particularly tin, improves ethene selectivity and suppresses coke formation.

3. Recent developments: The study focuses on controlling the size and composition of PtSn nanoparticles to optimize catalyst performance. A synthetic method was developed to create uniform-sized PtSn particles, which were then supported on calcined hydrotalcite (Mg(Al)O).

4. Potential advantages: The PtSn catalysts show improved selectivity to ethene and reduced coke formation compared to pure platinum catalysts. The Mg(Al)O support contributes to suppressing thermal cracking of ethane and minimizing coke formation on the support. Both geometric and electronic effects of the second metals modify the catalyst surface and change the surface chemistry involved in ethane dehydrogenation.

5. Industrial applications: While not explicitly discussed, the production of ethene from ethane dehydrogenation is mentioned as an attractive alternative to steam cracking of naphtha for producing this key chemical building block. The main by-product, hydrogen, is noted as a valuable commodity for various refinery applications.

The document does not provide information on metal oxide-based catalysts such as CrOx, gallium, indium, vanadium, zinc, and molybdenum oxides for comparison.

1. Composition: The study focuses on Zn/H-ZSM5 catalysts, where zinc cations are introduced into the H-ZSM5 zeolite structure. It also mentions the introduction of Ga and Pt species.

2. Effectiveness:
   - Both Zn and Pt species, when introduced into H-ZSM5, increase the rate and selectivity of aromatization reactions while inhibiting undesirable β-scission side reactions.
   - Zinc cations specifically:
     a) Decrease β-scission rates and reduce the residence time of alkenes in oligomerization/β-scission cycles.
     b) Increase rates and selectivity for C6-C8 aromatic products.
     c) Promote alkane dehydrogenation and subsequent removal of hydrogen as H2.
     d) Lead to the formation of unsaturated intermediates needed for cyclization.
     e) Increase turnover rates, aromatic site-time yields, and hydrogen disposal rates during ethane, propane, and propene aromatization.

3. Mechanism:
   - Zinc cations act as "portholes" for hydrogen desorption, facilitating the removal of hydrogen atoms as H2.
   - They increase the rate and reversibility of adsorption-desorption steps, affecting surface hydrogen concentrations and the extent of dehydrogenation of adsorbed intermediates.

4. Advantages: Zn/H-ZSM5 catalysts decrease β-scission rates and the residence time of alkenes within oligomerization/β-scission cycles, which reduces undesirable side reactions.

While the study doesn't directly compare noble metal catalysts to metal oxide catalysts like gallium, indium, vanadium, or molybdenum oxides, it suggests that platinum-based catalysts on spinel supports may offer improvements over traditional chromia-based catalysts for dehydrogenation reactions.

The literature primarily focuses on platinum-based catalysts modified with zinc for dehydrogenation reactions, rather than providing a comprehensive comparison with metal oxide-based catalysts. Key points about Pt-Zn catalysts include:

Composition: The catalysts are platinum supported on MCM-41 (a mesoporous silica material), with zinc incorporated either into the siliceous framework or deposited on the surface.

Effectiveness: Zn-modified Pt catalysts show excellent performance in the dehydrogenation of iso-butane to iso-butene, achieving 100% selectivity that remains stable over time. This represents a significant improvement over monometallic Pt catalysts.

Industrial applications: The catalysts are used for the dehydrogenation of light alkanes, specifically iso-butane to iso-butene, which is described as an important industrial reaction.

Recent developments: The study demonstrates that incorporating Zn into the silica framework of MCM-41 creates more stable and effective catalysts compared to conventional impregnation methods.

Potential advantages:
1. High selectivity (up to 100%) towards the desired product (iso-butene)
2. Stability over time, with no significant deactivation observed
3. Suppression of unwanted side reactions like cracking and isomerization
4. Improved catalyst lifetime

Mechanism: The presence of ionic Zn near platinum nanoparticles reduces the number of contiguous Pt sites, which suppresses undesired reactions that require large Pt ensembles. The desired dehydrogenation reaction can proceed on small ensembles of surface Pt atoms.

          Composition: The main catalysts discussed are supported platinum-tin catalysts. The support materials mentioned include ZSM-5, γ-Al2O3, mesoporous alumina, and SBA-15.

          Effectiveness: Pt-Sn catalysts are reported to show relatively high activity and selectivity in the dehydrogenation process. The catalytic properties strongly depend on the interaction between Pt and Sn, the chemical state of Sn, and the support effect.

          Industrial applications: Propane dehydrogenation is important for producing propene, which is used to make polypropene, acrolein, polyacrylonitrile, and acrylic acid. γ-Al2O3 supported PtSn catalyst is commonly used in reforming or dehydrogenation processes.

          Recent developments: The study itself represents recent research into the effects of different supports on Pt-Sn catalyst performance for propane dehydrogenation. Research has explored using various support materials like zeolites (ZSM-5) and mesoporous materials (SBA-15, mesoporous alumina) to improve catalyst performance.

          Potential advantages: Different supports can modify selectivity and influence the properties of the metallic phase. ZSM-5 zeolite has unique physical properties such as special three-dimensional channels, adjustable Si/Al ratio, and relatively large surface area. Mesoporous materials are used to disperse the active phase with more active sites.

          The document briefly mentions chromium-based catalysts but does not provide detailed information about other metal oxide catalysts like gallium, indium, vanadium, zinc, or molybdenum oxides.

The literature primarily focuses on noble metal-based catalysts, particularly platinum, for the nonoxidative dehydrogenation of light olefins. It does not provide a comprehensive comparison with metal oxide-based catalysts like CrOx, gallium, indium, vanadium, zinc, and molybdenum oxides.

Composition: Platinum-based catalysts are typically promoted with elements such as Sn, Zn, Ge, Ga, or In to form bimetallic alloys. These catalysts are often supported on calcined hydrotalcite-like materials such as Mg(Al)O, Mg(Ga)(Al)O, or Mg(In)(Al)O.

Effectiveness: Platinum is described as the most effective transition metal for alkane dehydrogenation. The bimetallic alloys, particularly PtIn and PtGa, show high activity and selectivity for ethane and propane dehydrogenation. For ethane dehydrogenation, Pt/Mg(In)(Al)O, Pt/Mg(Ga)(Al)O, and PtSn/Mg(Al)O exhibit comparable activities and selectivities. For propane dehydrogenation, the activity order is Pt/Mg(In)(Al)O > Pt/Mg(Ga)(Al)O > PtSn/Mg(Al)O > PtGa/Mg(Al)O > Pt/Mg(Al)O.

Recent developments: The study presents novel approaches using PtGa and PtIn bimetallic nanoparticles supported on Mg(Ga)(Al)O and Mg(In)(Al)O, respectively. These catalysts showed improved performance compared to other Pt-based catalysts, with high activity, selectivity, and reduced carbon deposition.

Potential advantages: The bimetallic nanoparticles produce less coke, which helps prevent catalyst deactivation. PtIn catalysts are more homogeneous in composition than PtSn particles and stable for dehydrogenation of C4 and C5 alkanes. The calcined hydrotalcite-like supports help stabilize the dispersed metal particles against sintering. The ability to tune catalyst properties by adjusting the promoter/Pt ratio (e.g., In/Pt) allows for optimization of catalyst performance.

The literature primarily focuses on platinum-based catalysts for ethane dehydrogenation, particularly platinum-tin (PtSn) bimetallic catalysts. It does not provide a comprehensive comparison with metal oxide-based catalysts. However, based on the information provided, we can discuss some aspects of platinum-based catalysts:

1. Composition: The catalysts discussed are primarily platinum-based, often modified with a second metal such as tin, indium, or gallium. The specific focus is on PtSn nanoparticles supported on Mg(Al)O (calcined hydrotalcite).

2. Effectiveness: Platinum is described as the most active catalyst for ethane dehydrogenation. However, pure platinum has low ethene selectivity and suffers from rapid coke deposition, leading to deactivation. The addition of a second metal, particularly tin, improves ethene selectivity and suppresses coke formation.

The Mg(Al)O support contributes to suppressing thermal cracking of ethane and minimizing coke formation on the support. Both geometric and electronic effects of the second metals modify the catalyst surface and change the surface chemistry involved in ethane dehydrogenation.

5. Industrial applications: While not explicitly discussed, the production of ethene from ethane dehydrogenation is mentioned as an attractive alternative to steam cracking of naphtha for producing this key chemical building block.
