[1] "Typically, Pt- or Cr-based catalysts are used in commercial dehydrogenation plants."
          [2] "PtSn bimetallic catalysts show the above mentioned characteristics, to some extent, more than the corresponding monometallic Pt catalysts"
          [3] "Catalyst with smaller particles (3 nm) is much more active and less selective than that with larger particles (21 nm). Rate of coking, selectivity to coke formation and the amount of coke formed are significantly higher over the former than that on the latter."
          [4] "This work exclusively evaluates the effect of Pt particle size on the activity, selectivity and the degree of coking."
          [5] "For the first time, we report that monometallic Pt-SBA-15 catalyst which contains smaller particles is much more active but less selective in DHP than catalyst with larger particles."

[1] "The introduction of Ga (123), Zn (2436), and Pt (3743) species into H-ZSM5 increases the rate and selectivity of aromatization reactions and inhibits β-scission side reactions that lead to undesirable products."

[2] "Zn cations decrease β-scission rates and the residence time of alkenes within oligomerization/β-scission cycles, leading to higher rates and selectivity for the synthesis of C6-C8 aromatic products."

[3] "Zn cations promote not only alkane dehydrogenation, but also the subsequent removal of hydrogen as H2, leading to unsaturated intermediates required in cyclization steps."

[4] "Zn cations act as portholes (68) for the desorption of H-atoms; as a result, they also increase the reverse reaction, the dissociative chemisorption of dihydrogen"

[5] "Modifications of pentasil zeolites with exchanged Zn cations increase turnover rates, aromatic site-time yields, and the rate of hydrogen disposal during ethane, propane, and propene aromatization."

[6] "As Zn cations increase the rate (and reversibility) of adsorptiondesorption steps, surface hydrogen concentrations and the extent of dehydrogenation of adsorbed intermediates begin to reflect not only the rate at which hydrogen forms in C-H bond activation steps, but also the rate at which it is introduced into the surface via dissociative chemisorption steps involving H2 in the gas phase."

[1] "Platinum-based materials are widely used in petrochemical and refining processes, such as alkane dehydrogenation."

[2] "Sn inhibits cracking, isomerization, and coke formation on Pt supported on Al2O3, SiO2, ZrO2, MgAl2O4, and KL zeolite."

[3] "PtGa/MgAl2O4, Pt/silicalite, and PtZn/silicalite also show higher selectivity and stability than Pt/g-Al2O3."

[4] "Here, we report a novel catalyst with unprecedented site activity and stability for propane and isobutane dehydrogenation. Exchanged Pt cations (0.10 wt%) in ZSM5 with Fe3+ in framework positions and Na as balancing cations lead to high alkene selectivities, near-equilibrium alkene yields, and turnover rates and stability significantly higher than previously reported."

[5] "Pt/Na-[Fe]ZSM5 gave substantially higher reaction rates and catalyst stability than these state-of-the-art Pt-based dehydrogenation catalysts."

[6] "Small Pt clusters in Na-[Fe]ZSM5 give high alkene selectivities, near-equilibrium alkene yields, and unprecedented stability in the catalytic dehydrogenation of light alkanes."

[7] "We achieve these improvements without relying on bimetallic clusters, which can unmix during oxidative regenerations, and without significant H2 partial pressures in alkane reactant streams."

[1] "Catalytic dehydrogenation processes are of increasing importance because of growing demand for light olefins such as propylene and isobutene. Supported platinum is a good catalyst for reforming and dehydrogenation reactions."

[2] "Addition of Sn to Pt/Al2O3 naphtha-reforming catalysts is well known to promote desired dehydrogenation reactions and inhibit coking reactions"

[3] "Addition of Zn to Pt-based catalysts can lead to an obvious change of catalytic performance. For example, the addition of Zn to Pt/Al2O3 catalysts can promote the selective reduction of NO and improve the resistance of these systems in waste gas treatment processes."

[4] "Over Pt/ZnO catalysts high hydrogenation and dehydrogenation selectivity could be obtained"

[5] "A great improvement in dehydrogenation selectivity is obtained over both zinc-doped Pt and PtSn catalysts."

[1] "As mentioned above, two main types of formulations are typically used for the nonoxidative dehydrogenation of light olefins: noble metal-based and metal oxide-based catalysts. Although Pt represents the only precious metal that has been extensively studied, various metal oxides have been successfully tested, CrOx being the most prominent example due to its industrial use."

[2] "Albeit all of the noble metals of group VIIIB are active in the nonoxidative hydrogenation of alkanes, Pt is the only noble metal utilized in commercial applications due to its superior activation of paraffinic CH bonds and low activity to CC cleavage."

[3] "The first industrial alkane dehydrogenation technology, the Pacol process (UOP), was first commercialized in 1968. On the basis of an alumina-supported platinum catalyst, the process greatly contributed to the widespread use of linear olefins in the detergent industry."

[4] "Noble metals are active for dehydrogenation in the metallic state, and in some cases a reduction step is necessary prior to reaction. The dehydrogenation reaction of light alkanes is insensitive to the structure of the platinum particles; that is, such reactions are independent of the platinum particle size or crystallographic plane exposed."

[5] "Despite the fact that platinum-based catalysts display very high activity in dehydrogenation reactions, their intrinsic selectivity to alkenes and catalyst stability are not entirely satisfactory. Consequently, the addition of promoters, which are able to modify the catalytic properties of platinum, is necessary to obtain an optimal catalyst."

[6] "High surface area alumina is the classical support employed in platinum-based dehydrogenation catalysts due to its high thermal stability, mechanical strength, and its exceptional ability of maintaining the platinum nanoparticles dispersed, which is crucial to attain stable catalyst performance."

[7] "Tin is by far the most studied promoter, and all of the platinum-based catalyst formulations that are industrially applied include this post-transition metal, the addition of which modifies both the platinum active phase and the support. Essentially, Sn suppresses hydrogenolysis and isomerization reactions, minimizes metal sintering, neutralizes the acidity of the support, and facilitates the diffusion of the coke species from the metal surface to the support."

[1] "Recent studies have shown that calcined hydrotalcites, referred to as Mg(Al)O, are good supports for Pt-based catalysts for the dehydrogenation of light alkanes to alkenes and hydrogen [19]."

[2] "High alkene selectivity, minimal coke formation, and better catalyst activity can be achieved by promoting Pt supported on Mg(Al)O or other supports with elements such as Sn, Ga, and Ge [9,1416,18]."

[3] "We have shown that Pt/Mg(Ga)(Al)O catalysts prepared by the method described in Part I of this work leads to an active alkane dehydrogenation catalyst that is highly selective for the formation of ethene and propene from ethane and propane, respectively."

[4] "We have also shown that Pt/Mg(Ga)(Al)O catalysts exhibit lower deactivation and coke formation than conventional bimetallic catalysts, such as PtSn/Mg(Al)O and PtGa/Mg(Al)O."

[5] "The enhanced activity, selectivity, and resistance to coke formation of the Ga-modified Pt catalysts are attributed to the formation of PtGa alloys."

[1] "Tin is the most widely used modifier of platinum in catalysts for direct alkane dehydrogenation, leading to a system with higher selectivity to olefins and higher stability"

          [2] "The most important tin effects on these catalysts are: (i) the strong inhibition of cracking due to a geometrical effect, and (ii) the decrease of the deactivation rate, either by a decrease of the coke formation rate or by a modification of the nature of the coke formed."

          [3] "Surface Organometallic Chemistry on Metals (SOMC/M) procedures applied to the synthesis of bimetallic catalysts lead to stable and highly dispersed systems, as it has been reported in the literature"

          [4] "Bimetallic PtSn/g-Al2O3 catalysts were prepared by employing SOMC/M techniques"

[1] "Bimetallic Pt-Sn and Pt-Pb catalysts often axe proposed for an improvement of the monometallic Pt/AI2Oa reforming catalyst."

          [2] "With increasing amounts of Pb or Sn the weak adsorption of hydrogen decreases, the adsorption of oxygen increases and the activity in the dehydrogenation of cyclohexane decreases."

          [3] "The reason of the strongly influenced adsorption capacity of Pt in bimetallic catalysts should be a chemical modification of Pt by Pb or Sn according to a tgand effect."

          [4] "Electronic interactions between Pt and Sn ]1/ and Pt and Pb 16] have been observed in spectroscopic investigations."

          [5] "Small amounts of Sn poison stronger than Pb."

          [6] "The decreasing low temperature adsorption could be explained in different ways. The dissociative adsorption of hydrogen could become a more and more activated process with increasing anounts of the second metal"

[1] "The PtZn system resembles in some aspects the PtSn system. Platinum and zinc can also form alloy phases of different stoichiometries (PtZn, Pt3Zn, among others), which may show distinctive catalytic behaviour as compared to monometallic platinum."

[2] "For example, it has been reported that Pt/ZnO catalysts can achieve 99% selectivity at 45% conversion in the dehydrogenation of iso-butane to iso-butene at 723 K [23]."

[3] "The bimetallic catalyst, with a bulk Zn/Pt atomic ratio of 13.7, showed a much higher initial activity in crotonaldehyde hydrogenation, although it deactivated more strongly with time on stream."

[4] "On the other hand, the catalytic behaviour for iso-butane dehydrogenation was greatly improved by the presence of zinc, the bimetallic catalyst being more active than its monometallic counterpart and showing 100% selectivity to iso-butene."

[5] "The modification of the catalytic behaviour of a noble metal through the addition of a second non-active metal able to form alloy phases or intermetallic compounds with the former is an interesting field in heterogeneous catalysis."

[1] "The effect of the addition of different metals (Re, Sn, Ge, Pb, etc.) to Pt/Al2O3 has been extensively studied for the application in the naphtha reforming process and in the dehydrogenation of low and high molecular weight parafns"

[2] "It is well known that the Ga addition to metallic catalysts supported on zeolite materials increases the yield to aromatics when they are used in parafns aromatization processes"

[3] "The main positive effect of the Ga addition to Pt/Al2O3 is related to the important increase in the selectivity to propylene"

[4] "When Ga is added to Pt/Al2O3, the initial selectivity to propylene is enhanced and the carbon retention is decreased."

[5] "The surface model postulated for this bimetallic system would involve the presence of two Ga species: one of them would correspond to Ga in an intimate contact with Pt and the another one could be assigned to Ga species localized on the support, which only produces a low modication of the support acidity."

[1] "The UOP Oleflex process [26] uses three or four radial-flow moving-bed reactors, packed with a supported Pt catalyst, in series with interstage heaters, similar to the UOP continuous regenerative reforming process [21,22]."

[2] "A key feature of the Lummus Catofin process [27] is the principle of storing the needed reaction heat in the catalyst bed. A supported chromium oxide catalyst is used in this process."

[3] "The catalyst used for dehydrogenation is a supported platinum catalyst promoted with tin."

[4] "The catalyst used is a promoted chromium oxide powder with high attrition resistance."

[5] "The UOP Oleflex process [26] uses three or four radial-flow moving-bed reactors, packed with a supported Pt catalyst, in series with interstage heaters, similar to the UOP continuous regenerative reforming process [21,22]. In the regeneration unit the coke is burned off the catalyst, the platinum is redispersed, and excess moisture is removed. The cycle time through the unit is between 2 and 7 days."

[6] "The SnamprogettiYarsintez FBD-4 design [25] is similar to older FCC units with continuous catalyst circulation between a fluidised-bed reactor and regenerator on a 3060 min cycle [28]. Catalyst returning from the regenerator, where coke is burned off, to the reactor supplies the reaction heat. The catalyst used is a promoted chromium oxide powder with high attrition resistance."

[1] "Pt-based catalysts are widely used in the dehydrogenation of paraffins to olefins [1], Pt Sn bimetallic catalysts are reported to be efficient catalysts for commercial operation [2]."

[2] "To improve the olefin selectivity and catalyst stability, alkali [36], alkaline earth [79], and rare earth metals [10,11] have been incorporated."

[3] "In addition to Al2O3, other supports, such as SiO2 [12], TiO2 [13], CCA [14], and mixed oxide spinels [15], have also been reported."

[4] "Compared to Al2O3, spinels such as MgAl2O4 have a lower acidity and a higher mechanical strength; these traits are important for dehydro-genation catalysts [16,17]."

[5] "Dehydrogenating long chain paraffins (n-C10C13) over Pt Sn/Al2O3 catalysts is an important process for the industrial synthesis of linear alkylbenzene sulfonate (LAS); LAS is a popular biodegradable detergent."

[6] "Dehydrogenating long chain paraffin suffers from severe coking and short catalyst lifetimes (a few months); in addition, the acidity of the support is critical and well established."

[7] "When dehydrogenating long chain paraffins, the cata-lysts tend to be deactivated very quickly during the initial stages of the reaction, particularly when the reaction takes place under harsh conditions, such as high temperatures, low gas hourly space velocity and small hydrogen/paraffin ratios."

[1] "Two classes of catalysts are used in commercial dehydrogenation processes, supported platinumtin catalysts and chromium oxide supported on alumina."

[2] "Platinum, usually promoted with tin, is used as a dehydrogenation catalyst in several industrial processes."

[3] "The promotion of Pt by Sn has been reported to have several advantages: it improves catalytic activity and dehydrogenation selectivity, prevents Pt sintering, and decreases deactivation due to coke formation"

[4] "Pt,Sn/Mg(Al)O catalysts have previously been found to possess superior activity and stability as a propane dehydrogenation catalyst compared to conventional Pt,Sn/Al2O3 catalysts."

[5] "A higher selectivity toward ethene, as well as a higher stability, is observed for the Pt,Sn/Mg(Al)O catalysts compared to the Pt/Mg(Al)O catalyst."

[6] "Nonacidic supports have been reported to result in less cracking and polymerization and enhanced stability in dehydrogenation reactions."

[7] "Sn covers the steps, corners, edges, and defects of the Pt particles, thus developing simultaneously a geometric and a chemical effect on the surface properties of the exposed Pt atoms."

[1] "In the search for improved properties of dehydrogenation catalysts, great interest has been focused on spinel type structures like magnesium and zinc aluminates [1-5]."

[2] "The main characteristics of those solids are hydrophobicity, high mechanical resistance and very low surface acidity, which are well suited to perform in the severe conditions imposed by dehydrogenation reactions of light alkanes [31]."

[3] "Those properties make them interesting as carriers for noble metals to substitute the more traditional Cr2O3/Al2O3 catalysts [2,4]."

[4] "Rennard and Freel [5] have shown that platinum supported on magnesium aluminate is more resistant to sintering due to regeneration by oxidative procedures than the Pt/Al2O3 and Pt/SiO2 systems."

[5] "Catalytic experiments on isobutane dehydrogenation point out that hydrogen as reaction medium is very important to achieve high activity and selectivity."

[6] "Some of the fundamental aspects like metal-support interaction and selectivity of the Pt/ZnAl2O4 catalysts for isobutane dehydrogenation leading to C4 alkenes were tackled in this work."

"Zn is a common ingredient on noble metal catalysts to control the activity and selectivity in a wide range of reactions."

"These Zn-doped MCM-41-based Pt catalysts exhibit also an excellent behaviour in the dehydrogenation of iso-butane to iso-butene, with a selectivity as high as 100%, which remains stable with time on stream."

"Presence of Zn both into the siliceous framework or deposited on the MCM-41 surface causes an important increase in the selectivity, reaching a value of as high as 100%, which remains stable until the end of the experiment."

"Thus, the presence of ionic Zn in the vicinity of platinum nanoparticles can lead to a decrease in the number of contiguous accessible platinum sites (by a decoration effect), suppressing the undesired reactions and thereby enhancing selectivity and stability."

"It has been probed that these unwanted reactions require large platinum ensembles which constitute the active site whereas, on the contrary, the desired dehydrogenation reaction can proceed on small ensembles of surface platinum atoms."

"Another interesting reaction for which noble metal catalysts modified with zinc have shown an improved behaviour is the dehydrogenation of light alkanes to the corresponding alkenes [2224]. As described above, the addition of the second more electropositive metal gives rise to an increased catalytic activity, improved selectivity and catalyst lifetime."

[1] "Among several reported catalysts, supported platinumtin catalysts have been studied in depth since they show relatively high activity and selectivity in the process [811]."

          [2] "In general, the catalytic properties of the PtSn catalysts strongly depend on the interaction between Pt and Sn, the chemical state of Sn, and the support effect [12]."

          [3] "Recently, extensive studies have been made on supported Pt or Cr catalysts [46]."

          [4] "Alumina has been used as an adsorbent, catalyst or catalyst support due to its desirable textual properties and surface acid-base properties. For instance, -Al2O3 supported PtSn catalyst is commonly used in reforming or dehydrogenation process [16]."

          [5] "Compared with the conventional support of -Al2O3, ZSM-5 zeolite has some unique physical properties, such as the special three-dimensional channel, adjusted Si Al ratio and relatively large surface area [18]."

          [6] "Besides, some mesoporous materials, such as SBA-15 and mesoporous alumina are often used as the catalyst support to disperse active phase with more active sites."

          [7] "As regards the role of support, it cannot only modify the selectivity of the process by catalyzing lateral reactions, but also influence the properties of the final metallic phase [13]."

          [8] "The catalytic dehydrogenation of propane is of increasing importance because of the growing demand for propene [13]. Indeed, propene is an important raw material for the production of polypropene, acrolein, polyacrylonitrile and acrylic acid. Recently, extensive studies have been made on supported Pt or Cr catalysts [46]."

[1] "Bimetallic catalysts supported on ZnAl2O4 and MgAl2O4 have been found to be active and selective for the direct dehydrogenation of light paraffins."

[2] "The use of ZnAl2O4 and MgAl2O4 as a support of PtSn is based on their neutral characteristics and very high thermal stability. The first characteristic is very important in paraffin dehydrogenation processes since a very high selectivity to olefins depends not only on adequate structure of the metallic phase but also on the low acidity of the support in order to minimize the undesirable lateral reactions (such as cracking and coke formation)"

[3] "The Sn addition to Pt/ZnAl2O4 and Pt/MgAl2O4 leads to an increase of the activity in n-butane dehydrogenation, and to high selectivity values to all butenes (1-butene, cis- and trans-2-butenes, and 1,3-butadiene)."

[4] "When Sn is added to Pt/MgAl2O4 and Pt/ZnAl2O4 catalysts, the tin reducibility is increased by either the catalytic effect of platinum or the PtSn co-reduction with probable alloy formation."

[5] "PtSn catalysts supported on ZnAl2O4 and MgAl2O4 show good catalytic stability levels after five reaction-regeneration cycles, though the stability of the PtSn/MgAl2O4 catalyst was clearly higher than for the PtSn/ZnAl2O4 one."

[6] "Besides, a very complex structure of the metallic phase appears to be present in the bimetallic catalysts. In fact, a probable description of this phase would involve the presence of Pt in zerovalent state, which could be partially alloyed with a fraction of zerovalent tin (according to CHD results)."

[1] "Platinum is the most effective transition metal for promoting alkane dehydrogenation; however, in order to achieve high alkene selectivity, it must be promoted with an element, such as Sn, Zn, Ge, Ga, or In, which interacts with the Pt to form a bimetallic alloy"

[2] "Bimetallic nanoparticles of Pt and the alloying element have also been found to produce less coke [1014], a product that can contribute to deactivation of the catalyst."

[3] "Recent work has shown that calcined hydrotalcite-like materials, referred to as Mg(Al)O, are ideal for this purpose [11,20,21]. Moreover, the Al cations present at the support surface help stabilize the dispersed metal particles against sintering [22]."

[4] "We have recently reported a novel approach for producing PtGa bimetallic nanoparticles exhibiting high activity and selectivity for ethane and propane dehydrogenation, as well as reduced carbon deposition [32]. These catalysts were prepared by dispersing Pt nanoparticles onto a calcined hydrotalcite-like support containing Ga, Mg(Ga)(Al)O."

[5] "PtIn catalysts have also been found to be more homogenous in composition than PtSn particles [31] and to be stable for dehydrogenation of C4 and C5 alkanes [3]. Consequently, PtIn catalysts could potentially be effective catalysts for dehydrogenation of light alkanes in general."

[6] "For ethane dehydrogenation, Pt/Mg(In)(Al)O 0.48, Pt/Mg(Ga)(Al)O 2.9, and PtSn/Mg(Al)O 0.6 exhibit comparable activities and selectivities."

[7] "For propane dehydrogenation, the catalyst activity decreases in the order Pt/Mg(In)(Al)O 0.48 > Pt/Mg(Ga)(Al)O 2.9 > PtSn/Mg(Al)O 0.6 > PtGa/Mg(Al)O 3.0 > Pt/Mg(Al)O."

[8] "The activity and selectivity of the Pt/Mg(In)(Al)O catalysts for ethane and propane dehydrogenation reactions are strongly dependent on the bulk In/Pt ratio. For both reactants, maximum activity was achieved for a bulk In/Pt ratio of 0.48, and at this In/Pt ratio, the selectivity to alkene was nearly 100%."

[1] "Supported platinum (Pt)tin (Sn) catalysts have been widely used in naphtha reforming or alkane dehydrogenation processes due to their high selectivity and stability"

          [2] "Nowadays, several studies are being carried out to evaluate the modification of the stability, selectivity and activity of the metallic catalysts by the addition of some alkali metals such as Li, Ba, K and Ca in PtSn/Al2O3 catalyst."

          [3] "The incorporation of Sn and Li improved light-paraffin dehydrogenation and inhibited isomerization and cracking reactions"

[1] "Dehydrogenation employs chromia-alumina catalysts and, more recently, platinum or modified platinum catalysts."

[2] "A different approach to catalytic dehydrogenation was first introduced in the mid-1960s for the supply of long-chain linear olefins for the production of biodegradable detergents."

[3] "In the early 1970s, UOP introduced continuous catalyst regeneration (CCR) technology that enabled noble metal catalysts to remain at their most desirable stable activity for several years without having to shut down the reactor for catalyst regeneration."

[4] "The work on catalytic reforming with noble metal (Pt) catalysts done in the 1940s by Haensel clearly demonstrated that Pt-based catalysts had high activity for the dehydrogenation of paraffins to the corresponding olefins"

[5] "Nakagawa et al. [63] studied a series of metal oxides for ethane dehydrogenation in the presence of CO2 at 650 C, C2H6:CO2 = 5:25 ml/min and SV = 900 h1 ml (g-cat)1. The order of activity was as follows: Ga2O3 > Cr2O3 > V2O5 > TiO2 > Mn3O4 > In2O3 > ZnO > La2O3."

[6] "The key role of dehydrogenation catalysts is to accelerate the main reaction while controlling other reactions. Unmodified alumina-supported platinum catalysts are highly active but are not selective to dehydrogenation."

[7] "The role of platinum modifiers is to weaken the platinumolefin interaction selectively without affecting the platinumparaffin interaction. Arsenic, tin, germanium, lead, bismuth are among metals reported as platinum activity modifiers."

[8] "Bloch [10] further extended this thinking by developing Pt-based catalysts that could selectively dehydrogenate long-chain linear paraffins to the corresponding internal mono-olefins with high activity and stability and with minimum cracking."

[9] "Particularly, notable for its high selectivity to propylene is a vanadia-silica-zirconia catalyst of Rulkens and Tilley at the University of California, Berkley, CA [75]. These workers using a molecular precursor route, produced an 18/36/46 V2O5-SiO2-ZrO2 catalyst which gave 81.5% selectivity to propylene at 8% conversion of propane at 550 C."

[10] "Wang et al. [64] of Japan studied the effect of sulfate and Na-treatment silica on the dehydrogenation of ethane with CO2 at 650 C and 1 atm. Sulfating silica (348 m2/g) with (NH4)2SO4 (and calcining at 700 C/3 h to give 2 wt.% SO42), and adding 5 wt.% Cr gave the best catalytic performance."

[1] "Platinum is known as an active catalyst for the dehydrogenation of light alkanes, but in the absence of modifiers suffers from low alkene selectivity and deactivation due to rapid coke formation."

[2] "Alkene selectivity can be increased, and the tendency to form coke decreased by promoting Pt with elements, such as Sn, Zn, Ge, Pb, and Re [16]."

[3] "A novel approach is described for preparing Ga-promoted Pt particles for the dehydrogenation of light alkanes to alkenes. The modifying element, Ga, was introduced by transference from the support, a calcined Mg(Ga)(Al)O hydrotalcite-like material."

[4] "Light alkenes, such as ethylene, propylene, and n-butene, are widely used as building blocks for the production of commodity chemical and polymers. Rising demand for light alkenes has exceeded the capacity for the production of these products by petroleum cracking, the current principal source, motivating an interest for seeking other means for producing intermediates."

[5] "After reduction at 773873 K, PtGa alloys were observed. It is proposed that at high reduction temperatures, H atoms formed on the surface of the metal particles spill over onto the support where they reduce Ga3+ cation to atomic Ga, which then interacts with the supported Pt to form PtGa alloys."

[6] "Previous studies have shown that the formation of coke is minimized using non-acidic supports such as KL zeolite, alkali-doped alumina, spinels, and calcined hydrotalcite [Mg(Al)O] [3136]."

[1] "Typically, PtSn supported on alumina or Cr2O3 supported on alumina or zirconia are the commercial catalysts for this reaction [1,2]."

[2] "A variety of Pt catalysts, often promoted with other electropositive metals and supported on various carriers (e.g., SiO2 [3], ZSM5 [4,5], L-zeolite [6], SBA-15 [2,5,7], Y-zeolite [6], MOR [6], Beta [6,8], and Mg(Al)O [9]), were investigated for the dehydrogenation of propane to propylene reaction in an effort to find an optimum catalyst."

[3] "Biscardi and Iglesia [15] investigated the elementary reaction steps of propane dehydrogenation over H-ZSM5 and Ga/H-ZSM5 catalysts using an equimolar mixture of C3H8/C3D8."

[4] "Jackson et al. [14] studied the dehydrogenation of propane using a C3H8/C3D8 mixture on chromia and found an NKIE of 1.85; thus, C-H bond activation was identified to be the rate determining step."

[1] "The principal by-product of ethane dehydrogenation is hydrogen, a vital commodity that can be used for a variety of applications in a refinery"

[2] "The most active catalyst for ethane dehydrogenation is platinum; however, in its pure form, it exhibits low ethene selectivity and rapid coke deposition, which contributes to catalyst deactivation"

[3] "The addition of a second metal, such as tin, indium, or gallium, to platinum has been found to be effective in increasing ethene selectivity and suppressing coke formation"

[4] "Both geometric and electronic effects of the second metals have been proposed to explain their roles in modifying the catalyst surface and changing the surface chemistry involved in ethane dehydrogenation"

[5] "Calcined hydrotalcite, namely Mg(Al)O, was used as a support of the metal particles for its high thermal stability and moderate basicity. Previous studies have shown that Mg(Al)O suppresses thermal cracking of ethane and minimizes the formation of coke on the support"

[6] "A synthetic method was employed to make PtSn particles of uniform size, which are then loaded onto a calcined hydrotalcite (Mg(Al)O) support."

[1] "Pt and Pt-based alloys have long been known as important catalysts in heterogeneous catalysis. Pt-based catalyst can be used in many industry processes, including the hydrogenation of olefins, the dehydrogenation and cracking of paraffins, e.g., the conversion of propane to propylene [59]."

[2] "Currently, commercial process for propylene synthesis through direct dehydrogenation of propane is available. However, this process suffers from several problems such as coke formation and thermodynamic limitations [4]."

[3] "Compared to the direct dehydrogenation process, the so-called dehydrogenation oxidation (DHO) is preferred because of the introduction of selective oxidation of H2."

[1] "Pt-based catalysts have been widely used for alkane dehydrogenation reactions due to their excellent activity"

[2] "Sn is often added to alter the product distribution for hydrocarbon conversion through the inhibition of hydrogenolysis, isomerisation, cracking and coke formation, thereby enhancing the catalyst selectivity and stability"

[3] "The PtASn/Al2O3 catalyst possesses both a higher propane conversion and propene selectivity, which is maintained throughout the duration of the first dehydrogenation step."

[4] "The presence of Sn not only reduces the amount of coke formed during a propane dehydrogenation run but also modifies its rate of formation."

[5] "The catalytic performances of Pt/Al2O3 and PtSn/Al2O3 catalysts for the dehydrogenation of propane through consecutive reactionregeneration cycles have been studied under realistic reaction conditions."

[6] "It suggests that coke precursors adsorb less strongly on the PtASn bimetallic catalyst due to an ensemble effect of Sn. Therefore, coke precursors are mobile and easily migrate to the support where they finally deposit as coke."

[7] "Pt/Al2O3 catalyst exhibits a higher initial propane conversion than the PtASn/Al2O3 catalyst. However, the initial selectivity to propene is much lower (60%) when compared to the PtASn/Al2O3 catalyst (90%)"

[1] "Pt-based catalysts are among the most active and selective for alkane dehydrogenation."

[2] "Pt/Na[Fe]ZSM-5 materials, prepared by ion-exchange of Pt onto Na[Fe]ZSM-5, showed unprecedented rates and stability in the selective dehydrogenation of C2C4 alkanes."

[3] "CsPt/Na[Fe]ZSM-5 samples gave much higher selectivities to linear pentenes (96%) than Pt/Na[Fe]ZSM-5 (28%)."

[4] "These materials catalyze dehydrogenation of larger n-alkanes with unprecedented rates and with very high selectivity to n-alkenes. The catalyst stability is excellent in comparison with catalytic materials in previous reports, which required much higher H2 pressures for stable operation."

[5] "Heptene formation rates (compared per Pt, because dispersion were not reported in the earlier study12) on CsPt/Na[Fe]ZSM-5 were almost ten-fold higher than on PtSn/Al2O3ClLi catalysts12 at similar conditions (Table 2)."

[1] "Typically, Pt- or Cr-based catalysts are used in commercial dehydrogenation plants."
          [2] "PtSn bimetallic catalysts show the above mentioned characteristics, to some extent, more than the corresponding monometallic Pt catalysts"
          [3] "Catalyst with smaller particles (3 nm) is much more active and less selective than that with larger particles (21 nm). Rate of coking, selectivity to coke formation and the amount of coke formed are significantly higher over the former than that on the latter."
          [4] "This work exclusively evaluates the effect of Pt particle size on the activity, selectivity and the degree of coking."
          [5] "For the first time, we report that monometallic Pt-SBA-15 catalyst which contains smaller particles is much more active but less selective in DHP than catalyst with larger particles."

[1] "The introduction of Ga (123), Zn (2436), and Pt (3743) species into H-ZSM5 increases the rate and selectivity of aromatization reactions and inhibits β-scission side reactions that lead to undesirable products."

[2] "Zn cations decrease β-scission rates and the residence time of alkenes within oligomerization/β-scission cycles, leading to higher rates and selectivity for the synthesis of C6-C8 aromatic products."

[3] "Zn cations promote not only alkane dehydrogenation, but also the subsequent removal of hydrogen as H2, leading to unsaturated intermediates required in cyclization steps."

[4] "Zn cations act as portholes (68) for the desorption of H-atoms; as a result, they also increase the reverse reaction, the dissociative chemisorption of dihydrogen"

[5] "Modifications of pentasil zeolites with exchanged Zn cations increase turnover rates, aromatic site-time yields, and the rate of hydrogen disposal during ethane, propane, and propene aromatization."

[6] "As Zn cations increase the rate (and reversibility) of adsorptiondesorption steps, surface hydrogen concentrations and the extent of dehydrogenation of adsorbed intermediates begin to reflect not only the rate at which hydrogen forms in C-H bond activation steps, but also the rate at which it is introduced into the surface via dissociative chemisorption steps involving H2 in the gas phase."

[1] "Platinum-based materials are widely used in petrochemical and refining processes, such as alkane dehydrogenation."

[2] "Sn inhibits cracking, isomerization, and coke formation on Pt supported on Al2O3, SiO2, ZrO2, MgAl2O4, and KL zeolite."

[3] "PtGa/MgAl2O4, Pt/silicalite, and PtZn/silicalite also show higher selectivity and stability than Pt/g-Al2O3."

[4] "Here, we report a novel catalyst with unprecedented site activity and stability for propane and isobutane dehydrogenation. Exchanged Pt cations (0.10 wt%) in ZSM5 with Fe3+ in framework positions and Na as balancing cations lead to high alkene selectivities, near-equilibrium alkene yields, and turnover rates and stability significantly higher than previously reported."

[5] "Pt/Na-[Fe]ZSM5 gave substantially higher reaction rates and catalyst stability than these state-of-the-art Pt-based dehydrogenation catalysts."

[6] "Small Pt clusters in Na-[Fe]ZSM5 give high alkene selectivities, near-equilibrium alkene yields, and unprecedented stability in the catalytic dehydrogenation of light alkanes."

[7] "We achieve these improvements without relying on bimetallic clusters, which can unmix during oxidative regenerations, and without significant H2 partial pressures in alkane reactant streams."

[1] "Catalytic dehydrogenation processes are of increasing importance because of growing demand for light olefins such as propylene and isobutene. Supported platinum is a good catalyst for reforming and dehydrogenation reactions."

[2] "Addition of Sn to Pt/Al2O3 naphtha-reforming catalysts is well known to promote desired dehydrogenation reactions and inhibit coking reactions"

[3] "Addition of Zn to Pt-based catalysts can lead to an obvious change of catalytic performance. For example, the addition of Zn to Pt/Al2O3 catalysts can promote the selective reduction of NO and improve the resistance of these systems in waste gas treatment processes."

[4] "Over Pt/ZnO catalysts high hydrogenation and dehydrogenation selectivity could be obtained"

[5] "A great improvement in dehydrogenation selectivity is obtained over both zinc-doped Pt and PtSn catalysts."

[1] "As mentioned above, two main types of formulations are typically used for the nonoxidative dehydrogenation of light olefins: noble metal-based and metal oxide-based catalysts. Although Pt represents the only precious metal that has been extensively studied, various metal oxides have been successfully tested, CrOx being the most prominent example due to its industrial use."

[2] "Albeit all of the noble metals of group VIIIB are active in the nonoxidative hydrogenation of alkanes, Pt is the only noble metal utilized in commercial applications due to its superior activation of paraffinic CH bonds and low activity to CC cleavage."

[3] "The first industrial alkane dehydrogenation technology, the Pacol process (UOP), was first commercialized in 1968. On the basis of an alumina-supported platinum catalyst, the process greatly contributed to the widespread use of linear olefins in the detergent industry."

[4] "Noble metals are active for dehydrogenation in the metallic state, and in some cases a reduction step is necessary prior to reaction. The dehydrogenation reaction of light alkanes is insensitive to the structure of the platinum particles; that is, such reactions are independent of the platinum particle size or crystallographic plane exposed."

[5] "Despite the fact that platinum-based catalysts display very high activity in dehydrogenation reactions, their intrinsic selectivity to alkenes and catalyst stability are not entirely satisfactory. Consequently, the addition of promoters, which are able to modify the catalytic properties of platinum, is necessary to obtain an optimal catalyst."

[6] "High surface area alumina is the classical support employed in platinum-based dehydrogenation catalysts due to its high thermal stability, mechanical strength, and its exceptional ability of maintaining the platinum nanoparticles dispersed, which is crucial to attain stable catalyst performance."

[7] "Tin is by far the most studied promoter, and all of the platinum-based catalyst formulations that are industrially applied include this post-transition metal, the addition of which modifies both the platinum active phase and the support. Essentially, Sn suppresses hydrogenolysis and isomerization reactions, minimizes metal sintering, neutralizes the acidity of the support, and facilitates the diffusion of the coke species from the metal surface to the support."

[1] "Recent studies have shown that calcined hydrotalcites, referred to as Mg(Al)O, are good supports for Pt-based catalysts for the dehydrogenation of light alkanes to alkenes and hydrogen [19]."

[2] "High alkene selectivity, minimal coke formation, and better catalyst activity can be achieved by promoting Pt supported on Mg(Al)O or other supports with elements such as Sn, Ga, and Ge [9,1416,18]."

[3] "We have shown that Pt/Mg(Ga)(Al)O catalysts prepared by the method described in Part I of this work leads to an active alkane dehydrogenation catalyst that is highly selective for the formation of ethene and propene from ethane and propane, respectively."

[4] "We have also shown that Pt/Mg(Ga)(Al)O catalysts exhibit lower deactivation and coke formation than conventional bimetallic catalysts, such as PtSn/Mg(Al)O and PtGa/Mg(Al)O."

[5] "The enhanced activity, selectivity, and resistance to coke formation of the Ga-modified Pt catalysts are attributed to the formation of PtGa alloys."

[1] "Tin is the most widely used modifier of platinum in catalysts for direct alkane dehydrogenation, leading to a system with higher selectivity to olefins and higher stability"

          [2] "The most important tin effects on these catalysts are: (i) the strong inhibition of cracking due to a geometrical effect, and (ii) the decrease of the deactivation rate, either by a decrease of the coke formation rate or by a modification of the nature of the coke formed."

          [3] "Surface Organometallic Chemistry on Metals (SOMC/M) procedures applied to the synthesis of bimetallic catalysts lead to stable and highly dispersed systems, as it has been reported in the literature"

          [4] "Bimetallic PtSn/g-Al2O3 catalysts were prepared by employing SOMC/M techniques"

[1] "Bimetallic Pt-Sn and Pt-Pb catalysts often axe proposed for an improvement of the monometallic Pt/AI2Oa reforming catalyst."

          [2] "With increasing amounts of Pb or Sn the weak adsorption of hydrogen decreases, the adsorption of oxygen increases and the activity in the dehydrogenation of cyclohexane decreases."

          [3] "The reason of the strongly influenced adsorption capacity of Pt in bimetallic catalysts should be a chemical modification of Pt by Pb or Sn according to a tgand effect."

          [4] "Electronic interactions between Pt and Sn ]1/ and Pt and Pb 16] have been observed in spectroscopic investigations."

          [5] "Small amounts of Sn poison stronger than Pb."

          [6] "The decreasing low temperature adsorption could be explained in different ways. The dissociative adsorption of hydrogen could become a more and more activated process with increasing anounts of the second metal"

[1] "The PtZn system resembles in some aspects the PtSn system. Platinum and zinc can also form alloy phases of different stoichiometries (PtZn, Pt3Zn, among others), which may show distinctive catalytic behaviour as compared to monometallic platinum."

[2] "For example, it has been reported that Pt/ZnO catalysts can achieve 99% selectivity at 45% conversion in the dehydrogenation of iso-butane to iso-butene at 723 K [23]."

[3] "The bimetallic catalyst, with a bulk Zn/Pt atomic ratio of 13.7, showed a much higher initial activity in crotonaldehyde hydrogenation, although it deactivated more strongly with time on stream."

[4] "On the other hand, the catalytic behaviour for iso-butane dehydrogenation was greatly improved by the presence of zinc, the bimetallic catalyst being more active than its monometallic counterpart and showing 100% selectivity to iso-butene."

[5] "The modification of the catalytic behaviour of a noble metal through the addition of a second non-active metal able to form alloy phases or intermetallic compounds with the former is an interesting field in heterogeneous catalysis."

[1] "The effect of the addition of different metals (Re, Sn, Ge, Pb, etc.) to Pt/Al2O3 has been extensively studied for the application in the naphtha reforming process and in the dehydrogenation of low and high molecular weight parafns"

[2] "It is well known that the Ga addition to metallic catalysts supported on zeolite materials increases the yield to aromatics when they are used in parafns aromatization processes"

[3] "The main positive effect of the Ga addition to Pt/Al2O3 is related to the important increase in the selectivity to propylene"

[4] "When Ga is added to Pt/Al2O3, the initial selectivity to propylene is enhanced and the carbon retention is decreased."

[5] "The surface model postulated for this bimetallic system would involve the presence of two Ga species: one of them would correspond to Ga in an intimate contact with Pt and the another one could be assigned to Ga species localized on the support, which only produces a low modication of the support acidity."

[1] "The UOP Oleflex process [26] uses three or four radial-flow moving-bed reactors, packed with a supported Pt catalyst, in series with interstage heaters, similar to the UOP continuous regenerative reforming process [21,22]."

[2] "A key feature of the Lummus Catofin process [27] is the principle of storing the needed reaction heat in the catalyst bed. A supported chromium oxide catalyst is used in this process."

[3] "The catalyst used for dehydrogenation is a supported platinum catalyst promoted with tin."

[4] "The catalyst used is a promoted chromium oxide powder with high attrition resistance."

[5] "The UOP Oleflex process [26] uses three or four radial-flow moving-bed reactors, packed with a supported Pt catalyst, in series with interstage heaters, similar to the UOP continuous regenerative reforming process [21,22]. In the regeneration unit the coke is burned off the catalyst, the platinum is redispersed, and excess moisture is removed. The cycle time through the unit is between 2 and 7 days."

[6] "The SnamprogettiYarsintez FBD-4 design [25] is similar to older FCC units with continuous catalyst circulation between a fluidised-bed reactor and regenerator on a 3060 min cycle [28]. Catalyst returning from the regenerator, where coke is burned off, to the reactor supplies the reaction heat. The catalyst used is a promoted chromium oxide powder with high attrition resistance."

[1] "Pt-based catalysts are widely used in the dehydrogenation of paraffins to olefins [1], Pt Sn bimetallic catalysts are reported to be efficient catalysts for commercial operation [2]."

[2] "To improve the olefin selectivity and catalyst stability, alkali [36], alkaline earth [79], and rare earth metals [10,11] have been incorporated."

[3] "In addition to Al2O3, other supports, such as SiO2 [12], TiO2 [13], CCA [14], and mixed oxide spinels [15], have also been reported."

[4] "Compared to Al2O3, spinels such as MgAl2O4 have a lower acidity and a higher mechanical strength; these traits are important for dehydro-genation catalysts [16,17]."

[5] "Dehydrogenating long chain paraffins (n-C10C13) over Pt Sn/Al2O3 catalysts is an important process for the industrial synthesis of linear alkylbenzene sulfonate (LAS); LAS is a popular biodegradable detergent."

[6] "Dehydrogenating long chain paraffin suffers from severe coking and short catalyst lifetimes (a few months); in addition, the acidity of the support is critical and well established."

[7] "When dehydrogenating long chain paraffins, the cata-lysts tend to be deactivated very quickly during the initial stages of the reaction, particularly when the reaction takes place under harsh conditions, such as high temperatures, low gas hourly space velocity and small hydrogen/paraffin ratios."

[1] "Two classes of catalysts are used in commercial dehydrogenation processes, supported platinumtin catalysts and chromium oxide supported on alumina."

[2] "Platinum, usually promoted with tin, is used as a dehydrogenation catalyst in several industrial processes."

[3] "The promotion of Pt by Sn has been reported to have several advantages: it improves catalytic activity and dehydrogenation selectivity, prevents Pt sintering, and decreases deactivation due to coke formation"

[4] "Pt,Sn/Mg(Al)O catalysts have previously been found to possess superior activity and stability as a propane dehydrogenation catalyst compared to conventional Pt,Sn/Al2O3 catalysts."

[5] "A higher selectivity toward ethene, as well as a higher stability, is observed for the Pt,Sn/Mg(Al)O catalysts compared to the Pt/Mg(Al)O catalyst."

[6] "Nonacidic supports have been reported to result in less cracking and polymerization and enhanced stability in dehydrogenation reactions."

[7] "Sn covers the steps, corners, edges, and defects of the Pt particles, thus developing simultaneously a geometric and a chemical effect on the surface properties of the exposed Pt atoms."

[1] "In the search for improved properties of dehydrogenation catalysts, great interest has been focused on spinel type structures like magnesium and zinc aluminates [1-5]."

[2] "The main characteristics of those solids are hydrophobicity, high mechanical resistance and very low surface acidity, which are well suited to perform in the severe conditions imposed by dehydrogenation reactions of light alkanes [31]."

[3] "Those properties make them interesting as carriers for noble metals to substitute the more traditional Cr2O3/Al2O3 catalysts [2,4]."

[4] "Rennard and Freel [5] have shown that platinum supported on magnesium aluminate is more resistant to sintering due to regeneration by oxidative procedures than the Pt/Al2O3 and Pt/SiO2 systems."

[5] "Catalytic experiments on isobutane dehydrogenation point out that hydrogen as reaction medium is very important to achieve high activity and selectivity."

[6] "Some of the fundamental aspects like metal-support interaction and selectivity of the Pt/ZnAl2O4 catalysts for isobutane dehydrogenation leading to C4 alkenes were tackled in this work."

"Zn is a common ingredient on noble metal catalysts to control the activity and selectivity in a wide range of reactions."

"These Zn-doped MCM-41-based Pt catalysts exhibit also an excellent behaviour in the dehydrogenation of iso-butane to iso-butene, with a selectivity as high as 100%, which remains stable with time on stream."

"Presence of Zn both into the siliceous framework or deposited on the MCM-41 surface causes an important increase in the selectivity, reaching a value of as high as 100%, which remains stable until the end of the experiment."

"Thus, the presence of ionic Zn in the vicinity of platinum nanoparticles can lead to a decrease in the number of contiguous accessible platinum sites (by a decoration effect), suppressing the undesired reactions and thereby enhancing selectivity and stability."

"It has been probed that these unwanted reactions require large platinum ensembles which constitute the active site whereas, on the contrary, the desired dehydrogenation reaction can proceed on small ensembles of surface platinum atoms."

"Another interesting reaction for which noble metal catalysts modified with zinc have shown an improved behaviour is the dehydrogenation of light alkanes to the corresponding alkenes [2224]. As described above, the addition of the second more electropositive metal gives rise to an increased catalytic activity, improved selectivity and catalyst lifetime."

[1] "Among several reported catalysts, supported platinumtin catalysts have been studied in depth since they show relatively high activity and selectivity in the process [811]."

          [2] "In general, the catalytic properties of the PtSn catalysts strongly depend on the interaction between Pt and Sn, the chemical state of Sn, and the support effect [12]."

          [3] "Recently, extensive studies have been made on supported Pt or Cr catalysts [46]."

          [4] "Alumina has been used as an adsorbent, catalyst or catalyst support due to its desirable textual properties and surface acid-base properties. For instance, -Al2O3 supported PtSn catalyst is commonly used in reforming or dehydrogenation process [16]."

          [5] "Compared with the conventional support of -Al2O3, ZSM-5 zeolite has some unique physical properties, such as the special three-dimensional channel, adjusted Si Al ratio and relatively large surface area [18]."

          [6] "Besides, some mesoporous materials, such as SBA-15 and mesoporous alumina are often used as the catalyst support to disperse active phase with more active sites."

          [7] "As regards the role of support, it cannot only modify the selectivity of the process by catalyzing lateral reactions, but also influence the properties of the final metallic phase [13]."

          [8] "The catalytic dehydrogenation of propane is of increasing importance because of the growing demand for propene [13]. Indeed, propene is an important raw material for the production of polypropene, acrolein, polyacrylonitrile and acrylic acid. Recently, extensive studies have been made on supported Pt or Cr catalysts [46]."

[1] "Bimetallic catalysts supported on ZnAl2O4 and MgAl2O4 have been found to be active and selective for the direct dehydrogenation of light paraffins."

[2] "The use of ZnAl2O4 and MgAl2O4 as a support of PtSn is based on their neutral characteristics and very high thermal stability. The first characteristic is very important in paraffin dehydrogenation processes since a very high selectivity to olefins depends not only on adequate structure of the metallic phase but also on the low acidity of the support in order to minimize the undesirable lateral reactions (such as cracking and coke formation)"

[3] "The Sn addition to Pt/ZnAl2O4 and Pt/MgAl2O4 leads to an increase of the activity in n-butane dehydrogenation, and to high selectivity values to all butenes (1-butene, cis- and trans-2-butenes, and 1,3-butadiene)."

[4] "When Sn is added to Pt/MgAl2O4 and Pt/ZnAl2O4 catalysts, the tin reducibility is increased by either the catalytic effect of platinum or the PtSn co-reduction with probable alloy formation."

[5] "PtSn catalysts supported on ZnAl2O4 and MgAl2O4 show good catalytic stability levels after five reaction-regeneration cycles, though the stability of the PtSn/MgAl2O4 catalyst was clearly higher than for the PtSn/ZnAl2O4 one."

[6] "Besides, a very complex structure of the metallic phase appears to be present in the bimetallic catalysts. In fact, a probable description of this phase would involve the presence of Pt in zerovalent state, which could be partially alloyed with a fraction of zerovalent tin (according to CHD results)."

[1] "Platinum is the most effective transition metal for promoting alkane dehydrogenation; however, in order to achieve high alkene selectivity, it must be promoted with an element, such as Sn, Zn, Ge, Ga, or In, which interacts with the Pt to form a bimetallic alloy"

[2] "Bimetallic nanoparticles of Pt and the alloying element have also been found to produce less coke [1014], a product that can contribute to deactivation of the catalyst."

[3] "Recent work has shown that calcined hydrotalcite-like materials, referred to as Mg(Al)O, are ideal for this purpose [11,20,21]. Moreover, the Al cations present at the support surface help stabilize the dispersed metal particles against sintering [22]."

[4] "We have recently reported a novel approach for producing PtGa bimetallic nanoparticles exhibiting high activity and selectivity for ethane and propane dehydrogenation, as well as reduced carbon deposition [32]. These catalysts were prepared by dispersing Pt nanoparticles onto a calcined hydrotalcite-like support containing Ga, Mg(Ga)(Al)O."

[5] "PtIn catalysts have also been found to be more homogenous in composition than PtSn particles [31] and to be stable for dehydrogenation of C4 and C5 alkanes [3]. Consequently, PtIn catalysts could potentially be effective catalysts for dehydrogenation of light alkanes in general."

[6] "For ethane dehydrogenation, Pt/Mg(In)(Al)O 0.48, Pt/Mg(Ga)(Al)O 2.9, and PtSn/Mg(Al)O 0.6 exhibit comparable activities and selectivities."

[7] "For propane dehydrogenation, the catalyst activity decreases in the order Pt/Mg(In)(Al)O 0.48 > Pt/Mg(Ga)(Al)O 2.9 > PtSn/Mg(Al)O 0.6 > PtGa/Mg(Al)O 3.0 > Pt/Mg(Al)O."

[8] "The activity and selectivity of the Pt/Mg(In)(Al)O catalysts for ethane and propane dehydrogenation reactions are strongly dependent on the bulk In/Pt ratio. For both reactants, maximum activity was achieved for a bulk In/Pt ratio of 0.48, and at this In/Pt ratio, the selectivity to alkene was nearly 100%."

[1] "Supported platinum (Pt)tin (Sn) catalysts have been widely used in naphtha reforming or alkane dehydrogenation processes due to their high selectivity and stability"

          [2] "Nowadays, several studies are being carried out to evaluate the modification of the stability, selectivity and activity of the metallic catalysts by the addition of some alkali metals such as Li, Ba, K and Ca in PtSn/Al2O3 catalyst."

          [3] "The incorporation of Sn and Li improved light-paraffin dehydrogenation and inhibited isomerization and cracking reactions"

[1] "Dehydrogenation employs chromia-alumina catalysts and, more recently, platinum or modified platinum catalysts."

[2] "A different approach to catalytic dehydrogenation was first introduced in the mid-1960s for the supply of long-chain linear olefins for the production of biodegradable detergents."

[3] "In the early 1970s, UOP introduced continuous catalyst regeneration (CCR) technology that enabled noble metal catalysts to remain at their most desirable stable activity for several years without having to shut down the reactor for catalyst regeneration."

[4] "The work on catalytic reforming with noble metal (Pt) catalysts done in the 1940s by Haensel clearly demonstrated that Pt-based catalysts had high activity for the dehydrogenation of paraffins to the corresponding olefins"

[5] "Nakagawa et al. [63] studied a series of metal oxides for ethane dehydrogenation in the presence of CO2 at 650 C, C2H6:CO2 = 5:25 ml/min and SV = 900 h1 ml (g-cat)1. The order of activity was as follows: Ga2O3 > Cr2O3 > V2O5 > TiO2 > Mn3O4 > In2O3 > ZnO > La2O3."

[6] "The key role of dehydrogenation catalysts is to accelerate the main reaction while controlling other reactions. Unmodified alumina-supported platinum catalysts are highly active but are not selective to dehydrogenation."

[7] "The role of platinum modifiers is to weaken the platinumolefin interaction selectively without affecting the platinumparaffin interaction. Arsenic, tin, germanium, lead, bismuth are among metals reported as platinum activity modifiers."

[8] "Bloch [10] further extended this thinking by developing Pt-based catalysts that could selectively dehydrogenate long-chain linear paraffins to the corresponding internal mono-olefins with high activity and stability and with minimum cracking."

[9] "Particularly, notable for its high selectivity to propylene is a vanadia-silica-zirconia catalyst of Rulkens and Tilley at the University of California, Berkley, CA [75]. These workers using a molecular precursor route, produced an 18/36/46 V2O5-SiO2-ZrO2 catalyst which gave 81.5% selectivity to propylene at 8% conversion of propane at 550 C."

[10] "Wang et al. [64] of Japan studied the effect of sulfate and Na-treatment silica on the dehydrogenation of ethane with CO2 at 650 C and 1 atm. Sulfating silica (348 m2/g) with (NH4)2SO4 (and calcining at 700 C/3 h to give 2 wt.% SO42), and adding 5 wt.% Cr gave the best catalytic performance."

[1] "Platinum is known as an active catalyst for the dehydrogenation of light alkanes, but in the absence of modifiers suffers from low alkene selectivity and deactivation due to rapid coke formation."

[2] "Alkene selectivity can be increased, and the tendency to form coke decreased by promoting Pt with elements, such as Sn, Zn, Ge, Pb, and Re [16]."

[3] "A novel approach is described for preparing Ga-promoted Pt particles for the dehydrogenation of light alkanes to alkenes. The modifying element, Ga, was introduced by transference from the support, a calcined Mg(Ga)(Al)O hydrotalcite-like material."

[4] "Light alkenes, such as ethylene, propylene, and n-butene, are widely used as building blocks for the production of commodity chemical and polymers. Rising demand for light alkenes has exceeded the capacity for the production of these products by petroleum cracking, the current principal source, motivating an interest for seeking other means for producing intermediates."

[5] "After reduction at 773873 K, PtGa alloys were observed. It is proposed that at high reduction temperatures, H atoms formed on the surface of the metal particles spill over onto the support where they reduce Ga3+ cation to atomic Ga, which then interacts with the supported Pt to form PtGa alloys."

[6] "Previous studies have shown that the formation of coke is minimized using non-acidic supports such as KL zeolite, alkali-doped alumina, spinels, and calcined hydrotalcite [Mg(Al)O] [3136]."

[1] "Typically, PtSn supported on alumina or Cr2O3 supported on alumina or zirconia are the commercial catalysts for this reaction [1,2]."

[2] "A variety of Pt catalysts, often promoted with other electropositive metals and supported on various carriers (e.g., SiO2 [3], ZSM5 [4,5], L-zeolite [6], SBA-15 [2,5,7], Y-zeolite [6], MOR [6], Beta [6,8], and Mg(Al)O [9]), were investigated for the dehydrogenation of propane to propylene reaction in an effort to find an optimum catalyst."

[3] "Biscardi and Iglesia [15] investigated the elementary reaction steps of propane dehydrogenation over H-ZSM5 and Ga/H-ZSM5 catalysts using an equimolar mixture of C3H8/C3D8."

[4] "Jackson et al. [14] studied the dehydrogenation of propane using a C3H8/C3D8 mixture on chromia and found an NKIE of 1.85; thus, C-H bond activation was identified to be the rate determining step."

[1] "The principal by-product of ethane dehydrogenation is hydrogen, a vital commodity that can be used for a variety of applications in a refinery"

[2] "The most active catalyst for ethane dehydrogenation is platinum; however, in its pure form, it exhibits low ethene selectivity and rapid coke deposition, which contributes to catalyst deactivation"

[3] "The addition of a second metal, such as tin, indium, or gallium, to platinum has been found to be effective in increasing ethene selectivity and suppressing coke formation"

[4] "Both geometric and electronic effects of the second metals have been proposed to explain their roles in modifying the catalyst surface and changing the surface chemistry involved in ethane dehydrogenation"

[5] "Calcined hydrotalcite, namely Mg(Al)O, was used as a support of the metal particles for its high thermal stability and moderate basicity. Previous studies have shown that Mg(Al)O suppresses thermal cracking of ethane and minimizes the formation of coke on the support"

[6] "A synthetic method was employed to make PtSn particles of uniform size, which are then loaded onto a calcined hydrotalcite (Mg(Al)O) support."

[1] "Pt and Pt-based alloys have long been known as important catalysts in heterogeneous catalysis. Pt-based catalyst can be used in many industry processes, including the hydrogenation of olefins, the dehydrogenation and cracking of paraffins, e.g., the conversion of propane to propylene [59]."

[2] "Currently, commercial process for propylene synthesis through direct dehydrogenation of propane is available. However, this process suffers from several problems such as coke formation and thermodynamic limitations [4]."

[3] "Compared to the direct dehydrogenation process, the so-called dehydrogenation oxidation (DHO) is preferred because of the introduction of selective oxidation of H2."

[1] "Pt-based catalysts have been widely used for alkane dehydrogenation reactions due to their excellent activity"

[2] "Sn is often added to alter the product distribution for hydrocarbon conversion through the inhibition of hydrogenolysis, isomerisation, cracking and coke formation, thereby enhancing the catalyst selectivity and stability"

[3] "The PtASn/Al2O3 catalyst possesses both a higher propane conversion and propene selectivity, which is maintained throughout the duration of the first dehydrogenation step."

[4] "The presence of Sn not only reduces the amount of coke formed during a propane dehydrogenation run but also modifies its rate of formation."

[5] "The catalytic performances of Pt/Al2O3 and PtSn/Al2O3 catalysts for the dehydrogenation of propane through consecutive reactionregeneration cycles have been studied under realistic reaction conditions."

[6] "It suggests that coke precursors adsorb less strongly on the PtASn bimetallic catalyst due to an ensemble effect of Sn. Therefore, coke precursors are mobile and easily migrate to the support where they finally deposit as coke."

[7] "Pt/Al2O3 catalyst exhibits a higher initial propane conversion than the PtASn/Al2O3 catalyst. However, the initial selectivity to propene is much lower (60%) when compared to the PtASn/Al2O3 catalyst (90%)"

[1] "Pt-based catalysts are among the most active and selective for alkane dehydrogenation."

[2] "Pt/Na[Fe]ZSM-5 materials, prepared by ion-exchange of Pt onto Na[Fe]ZSM-5, showed unprecedented rates and stability in the selective dehydrogenation of C2C4 alkanes."

[3] "CsPt/Na[Fe]ZSM-5 samples gave much higher selectivities to linear pentenes (96%) than Pt/Na[Fe]ZSM-5 (28%)."

[4] "These materials catalyze dehydrogenation of larger n-alkanes with unprecedented rates and with very high selectivity to n-alkenes. The catalyst stability is excellent in comparison with catalytic materials in previous reports, which required much higher H2 pressures for stable operation."

[5] "Heptene formation rates (compared per Pt, because dispersion were not reported in the earlier study12) on CsPt/Na[Fe]ZSM-5 were almost ten-fold higher than on PtSn/Al2O3ClLi catalysts12 at similar conditions (Table 2)."
