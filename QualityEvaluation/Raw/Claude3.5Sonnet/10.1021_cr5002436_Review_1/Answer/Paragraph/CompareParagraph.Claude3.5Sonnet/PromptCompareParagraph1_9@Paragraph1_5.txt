4 Overview of Nonoxidative Dehydrogenation Catalyst Materials
ARTICLE SECTIONSJump To
As mentioned above, two main types of formulations are typically used for the nonoxidative dehydrogenation of light olefins: noble metal-based and metal oxide-based catalysts. Although Pt represents the only precious metal that has been extensively studied, various metal oxides have been successfully tested, CrOx being the most prominent example due to its industrial use. Furthermore, promising results have been obtained using gallium, indium, vanadium, zinc, and molybdenum oxides. These materials are discussed in detail hereinafter.
4.1 Platinum-Based Catalysts
In the 1960s, a new technology was developed for the synthesis of the long-chain linear olefins used in the production of biodegradable detergents. (26) This new approach was inspired by the well-known bifunctional supported metal catalysts utilized in catalytic reforming, where a noble metal catalyzes hydrogenation and dehydrogenation reactions and the acidic support provides the active sites needed for isomerization, cyclization, and hydrocracking reactions. In contrast, dehydrogenation catalysts are monofunctional, as the acidic function must be minimized to avoid side reactions.
Albeit all of the noble metals of group VIIIB are active in the nonoxidative hydrogenation of alkanes, Pt is the only noble metal utilized in commercial applications due to its superior activation of paraffinic C&ndash;H bonds and low activity to C&ndash;C cleavage. The first industrial alkane dehydrogenation technology, the Pacol process (UOP), was first commercialized in 1968. On the basis of an alumina-supported platinum catalyst, the process greatly contributed to the widespread use of linear olefins in the detergent industry. In the early 1970s, UOP developed the Oleflex process, which was initially applied for the production of butadiene and later extended to propylene.
4.1.1 Nature of the Active Sites
Noble metals are active for dehydrogenation in the metallic state, and in some cases a reduction step is necessary prior to reaction. The dehydrogenation reaction of light alkanes is insensitive to the structure of the platinum particles; that is, such reactions are independent of the platinum particle size or crystallographic plane exposed. As only the amount of active sites is relevant, small particles are preferred. However, undesired side reactions that occur during alkane dehydrogenation, such as hydrogenolysis, isomerization, and coke formation, are sensitive to the structure of the platinum particles, although there is no general consensus regarding the effect of dispersion on the rate of these reactions. Some studies stress the markedly inverse relationship between particle size and the rate of hydrogenolysis (see Figure 9), the latter reaction being one of the main causes of coke formation. (69-72) Contrarily, others believe that for hydrogenolysis to take place, carbon deposits need to be in the vicinity of adsorbed hydrogen, which is more likely to occur on large Pt ensembles than on small particles. (37, 73, 74)
DFT calculations have been utilized to calculate the energy barrier of propane dehydrogenation on flat (111) and stepped (211) Pt crystal planes by Yang et al. (72) Indeed, it was found that step sites are more reactive, as the energy barrier to form propylene is much lower on step sites (24&ndash;34 kJ mol&ndash;1) than on the flat surface (63&ndash;72 kJ mol&ndash;1). Nevertheless, propane adsorbs more strongly on the latter, forming propylidyne intermediates believed to serve as precursors for both hydrogenolysis and coke formation. (72, 75)
4.1.2 Catalyst Deactivation
Two main processes cause the deactivation of Pt-based dehydrogenation catalysts. First and foremost, the side reactions that form carbon deposits on the catalyst surface lead to the coverage of the active sites with coke, which results in a drop in activity. As it is not possible to completely prevent coke deposition, the catalyst needs to be regenerated frequently by combusting the coke deposits. However, the high temperature of both the regeneration process and the dehydrogenation reaction triggers the agglomeration or sintering of the platinum nanoparticles, the concomitant loss in active sites also resulting in catalyst deactivation. In addition to temperature, the composition of the reaction mixture has a profound influence on the sintering behavior of supported Pt catalysts. As early as 1977, Fiedorow et al. showed that Pt/Al2O3 catalysts more readily sinter in an oxygen-containing atmosphere than in a hydrogen-containing atmosphere at temperatures above 600 °C. (76, 77) A third important factor determining catalyst sintering is the interaction between Pt and the catalyst support. Nagai et al. reported that Pt on Al2O3 readily sinters after treatment in air at 800 °C, while Pt on CeO2 remains stable due to the strong interaction between ceria and Pt. The authors proposed that the strength of the Pt&ndash;support interaction depends on the strength of the Pt&ndash;O&ndash;M bond (where M represents the cation in the support), which in turn shows an excellent correlation with the electron density of the oxygen in the support. As a result, the authors conclude the electron density of oxygen in the support in effect controls the sintering of supported Pt particles. (78)
However, Pt can be redispersed on the catalyst by the addition of low amounts of oxygen and chlorine in the feed at temperatures around 500 °C, although this process can only occur when the interaction between the support and the PtOx and PtOxCly species formed is such that mobile surface complexes are produced. (76, 79-83)
4.1.3 Role of the Support
Good supports for dehydrogenation of alkanes have to be thermally stable, especially under the harsh hydrothermal conditions that the material experiences during the regeneration step. In addition, limited support acidity is needed to avoid undesirable side reactions, such as coke formation and alkane isomerization. Finally, for an optimal distribution of the metallic particles, a relatively large surface area and uniform pore size distribution are preferred. (85)
High surface area alumina is the classical support employed in platinum-based dehydrogenation catalysts due to its high thermal stability, mechanical strength, and its exceptional ability of maintaining the platinum nanoparticles dispersed, which is crucial to attain stable catalyst performance. However, most alumina supports are acidic, and therefore promoters are used to curb support acidity. The addition of alkaline metals, such as Li, Na, and K, poisons these acid sites, suppressing the formation of coke on the support as shown in Figure 10. (84, 86-89) Moreover, these promoters can modify the properties of the platinum and suppress side reactions, such as hydrogenolysis and isomerization, reportedly due to a reduction in the effective size of platinum clusters. (69-72) Zn and Mg have also been used to dope the support, because the resulting spinel phase is less acidic and thermally more stable. These spinels also curtail the sintering of platinum due to a strong metal&ndash;support interaction. (90-93) Yet another strategy is to use more stable polymorphs of alumina, such as θ- or α-alumina, because the latter have considerably less Brønsted acid sites relative to γ-alumina, albeit they also tend to have considerably lower surface areas. It is also important to mention that to reach a high dispersion of Pt on the support, Lewis acid sites and amphoteric OH groups are required (which limits the use of SiO2 and basic supports, such as MgO or ZnO). Indeed, by hydrothermally treating γ-Al2O3 prior to impregnation, the formation of additional hydroxyl groups results in a better Pt dispersion after impregnation and calcination. (94)
Zeolites are a commonly used alternative support for dehydrogenation catalysts. Dumesic and co-workers reported Pt&ndash;Sn supported on zeolite K-L to be a highly active, selective, and stable catalyst in the selective dehydrogenation of isobutane. (95-98) The authors suggest that in the presence of K, zeolite L can stabilize small Pt&ndash;Sn particles in the micropores of the support. In addition, this catalyst shows a high tolerance to coke deposition. This is particularly important as the strong acid sites of zeolites make them very susceptible to coking. (85) Recently, Azzam et al. studied how the structure of zeolite L affected the stability of a Pt/K-L catalyst during the dehydrogenation of propane. (99) Using kinetic isotope experiments, they found no evidence of isotopic scrambling, suggesting that the dehydrogenation reaction was irreversible in this system. Furthermore, the steric restraints of the zeolite structure do not prevent coke formation via bimolecular reactions, in contrast to what was observed for hexane aromatization. (100, 101) Iglesia et al. found Pt supported on Na&ndash;[Fe]ZSM-5 zeolites to be highly selective and stable catalysts in the dehydrogenation of light alkanes. (102) These authors claim that the replacement of the framework Al3+ for Fe3+ ions is essential for the Pt precursor to anchor inside the 10-member ring zeolite channels, which in turn is necessary to obtain subnanometric Pt clusters after reduction. The resulting catalyst displays high stability and selectivity toward light olefins, which is explained by the low acidity of the zeolitic support. Further modifications of the catalyst involving the neutralization of the residual acid sites with Cs after Pt reduction improved the selectivity of the catalyst in the dehydrogenation of n-pentane and n-heptane. (103) On the other hand, SBA-15 (a mesoporous silica) was found to be an unsuitable support, as the Pt&ndash;Sn nanoparticles readily sinter due to the weak metal&ndash;support interaction. (85)
4.1.4 Role of the Promoters
Despite the fact that platinum-based catalysts display very high activity in dehydrogenation reactions, their intrinsic selectivity to alkenes and catalyst stability are not entirely satisfactory. Consequently, the addition of promoters, which are able to modify the catalytic properties of platinum, is necessary to obtain an optimal catalyst. Tin is by far the most studied promoter, and all of the platinum-based catalyst formulations that are industrially applied include this post-transition metal, the addition of which modifies both the platinum active phase and the support. Essentially, Sn suppresses hydrogenolysis and isomerization reactions, minimizes metal sintering, neutralizes the acidity of the support, and facilitates the diffusion of the coke species from the metal surface to the support. Although these beneficial effects of tin promotion are well-known and have been amply described in the literature, the working principles of the Pt&ndash;Sn system are still under debate. Indeed, both geometric and electronic effects have been invoked to explain the mechanism through which tin influences the catalytic properties of platinum. In any case, it is clear that SnO2 species present on the catalyst are reduced by the hydrocarbon feed during the dehydrogenation reaction and/or during a prereduction step, yielding a Pt&ndash;Sn alloy. The reducibility of SnO2 depends largely on the interaction with the support, strong interaction making the reduction more difficult. However, Pt in close proximity assists with the reduction of Sn. (85)
From the geometric point of view, it has been suggested that isomerization, hydrogenolysis, and the formation of coke precursors can all be suppressed by reducing the size of platinum nanoparticles. (97, 98, 104, 105) Notably, the formation of a platinum&ndash;tin alloy and/or the partial covering of the platinum particles by tin species results in the creation of smaller platinum ensembles. Olsbye et al. have suggested that tin selectively covers low coordination platinum sites (such as steps, corners, edges, and defects), which they believe are responsible for the hydrogenolysis reaction. (106, 107) Furthermore, the so-called ensemble effect can be employed to explain the geometric advantages of Sn addition to Pt-based catalysts. Dehydrogenation is believed to be a structure-insensitive reaction, meaning that very small groups or even single Pt atoms can catalyze the reaction. On the other hand, side reactions, such as coking, are structure-sensitive, and require relatively large ensembles of Pt. Pt&ndash;Sn alloy formation effectively reduces the amount of neighboring Pt atoms within the ensembles, curbing these structure-sensitive reactions. Moreover, it has been suggested that the sintering of Pt nanoparticles is retarded with the addition of Sn. (107) Additionally, coke precursors prefer to adsorb on large Pt ensembles, and thus the addition of Sn facilitates the migration of these precursors from the Pt&ndash;Sn surface to the support, effectively reducing the detrimental effects of coke deposition. (104, 108)
A secondary effect of Sn addition is the modification of the electronic properties of platinum. Alloyed metallic Sn or Sn2+ species in close contact with platinum are able to transfer electrons to the 5d band of platinum atoms, which alters the adsorptive and catalytic properties of the metal. The interaction of promoters with platinum can be assessed by measuring the heat of adsorption of distinct probe molecules through microcalorimetric methods. (109-114) Dumesic et al. performed a thorough adsorption microcalorimetry study and observed that the heat of ethylene and isobutene adsorption decreases with the addition of tin. (115-117) Infrared spectroscopy revealed that during the adsorption of ethylene, tin suppresses the formation of ethylidyne species and weakens the molecular adsorption of ethylene on the platinum surface. Additional DFT calculations explained these experimental results by revealing an increase in the electron density of platinum, which weakens the adsorption of ethylidyne on platinum atoms in close contact with tin. As discussed in section 5.1, ethylidyne is suspected to be an important precursor of coke and hydrogenolysis. Furthermore, DFT calculations described in Figure 28 revealed that Sn promotion significantly reduces the dehydrogenation reaction rate of platinum catalysts, as the energy barrier of the dissociative adsorption of propane is increased. On the other hand, the selectivity is increased as the energy barrier for the desorption of propylene drops, making deep dehydrogenation and cracking reactions less likely. (114, 118, 119) The balance between these two effects results in an optimum ratio of Pt and Sn, which these calculations suggest is Pt3Sn. On the basis of X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) observations, Siri et al. reported an increase of the electron density of platinum when tin was incorporated to silica and γ-alumina-supported catalysts. (120) DFT calculations have shown that the addition of Sn also reduces the heat of adsorption of hydrogen on the Pt&ndash;Sn (111) surface, which suggests that the diffusion of hydrogen atoms is more facile on the latter than on a Pt (111) surface. (73, 121) Figure 11 illustrates the important role that the electronic modification of Pt by Sn is believed to play in inhibiting coke formation. The left part of the figure shows high energy resolution fluorescence detection X-ray absorption near edge structure (HERFD-XANES) intensity contour maps of the Pt L-edge of catalysts comprising alumina-supported Pt (top) and Pt&ndash;Sn (bottom). The right part of the figure shows a graphical interpretation of the XANES spectra, which illustrates the size of the metallic nanoparticles in both catalysts increasing during the regeneration step, an effect that is more severe for Pt/Al2O3. A shift to higher energies in the XANES spectra during the reduction step reveals that Pt becomes more electronegative, which is attributed to the formation of the Pt&ndash;Sn alloy. This phenomenon, which is triggered by the partial reduction of the SnO2 present on the support, is reversed during the oxidation step. (122) Sn enrichment of the Pt nanoparticles may be a problem, as the Pt3Sn alloy is believed to be significantly more active for the dehydrogenation reaction than the Pt&ndash;Sn alloy. (114, 123) Summarizing, Figure 12 shows an artist impression of a Pt&ndash;Sn nanoparticle on alumina.
Other metals have been studied as promoters of the activity of platinum in the dehydrogenation of alkanes. Most notably, zinc prevents undesired side reaction such as coke formation and isomerization in a fashion similar to that of tin. (124-129) GaOx and InOx dopants are used to hinder side reactions by the poisoning of surface Brønsted acid sites, while the formation of Pt&ndash;Ga and Pt&ndash;In alloys has both a geometric and an electronic effect on the Pt nanoparticles, decreasing coke deposition further. (130-133) Another alloy that has been investigated is Pt&ndash;Ge, which is believed to function in a way analogous to that of Pt&ndash;Sn, although the electronic effect is believed to be weaker. (134)
An overview of the Pt-based dehydrogenation catalysts discussed above, including relevant reaction parameters, such as conversion, selectivity, temperature, space velocity, and feed composition, is given in Table 3. The activity of the catalysts is compared using their calculated “specific activity”, which is defined as the moles of olefin formed per mol of Pt per second at the start of the dehydrogenation reaction. As mentioned before, the dehydrogenation reaction is insensitive to the structure of the Pt, so all Pt atoms present at the surface of the catalyst nanoparticles can be assumed to participate equally in the dehydrogenation reaction. However, it was not possible to calculate turnover frequency (TOF) due to the fact that Pt dispersion values (the ratio between the Pt at the surface versus the interior of the catalyst nanoparticles) were not forthcoming in most of the references included in Table 3. Finally, as a proxy for catalyst stability, we have determined the deactivation rate (rd), for which we assume a first-order deactivation mechanism: (135)
where Xstart and Xend represent the conversion at the start and the end of an experiment, and t is the duration of the experiment in hours, higher kd values being indicative of rapid deactivation, that is, low stability.

The nonoxidative dehydrogenation of light olefins is an important industrial process, with two main types of catalysts dominating the field: noble metal-based catalysts (particularly platinum) and metal oxide-based catalysts. This review will focus on comparing these two catalyst types in terms of composition, effectiveness, industrial applications, recent developments, and potential advantages.

Composition:
Noble metal-based catalysts typically consist of platinum nanoparticles, often promoted with elements such as tin, indium, gallium, zinc, or germanium. These are usually supported on high surface area materials like alumina, silica, or calcined hydrotalcites (e.g., Mg(Al)O) [10.1021/cr5002436\_1]. Metal oxide-based catalysts include chromia-alumina, gallium oxide, vanadium oxide, and more complex mixed oxides like vanadia-silica-zirconia [10.1016/s0926-860x(01)00816-x].

Effectiveness:
Platinum-based catalysts are generally more effective due to their superior activation of paraffinic C-H bonds and low activity for C-C cleavage [10.1021/cr5002436\_1]. However, unmodified platinum catalysts suffer from low alkene selectivity and rapid coke formation [10.1016/j.jcat.2010.06.017]. The addition of promoters like tin significantly improves selectivity and stability [10.1016/j.jcat.2010.09.018]. Metal oxide catalysts vary in effectiveness, with some showing high selectivity for specific reactions. For example, a vanadia-silica-zirconia catalyst demonstrated 81.5% selectivity to propylene at 8% conversion of propane at 550°C [10.1016/s0926-860x(01)00816-x].

Industrial applications:
Platinum-based catalysts are widely used in commercial processes such as UOP's Oleflex and Pacol for light and heavy paraffin dehydrogenation [10.1016/s0926-860x(01)00816-x]. The Pacol process, using alumina-supported platinum catalysts, has been in use since 1968 for linear olefin production in the detergent industry [10.1021/cr5002436\_1]. Metal oxide catalysts, particularly chromia-alumina, have been used in processes like Catofin [10.1016/s0926-860x(00)00842-5].

Recent developments:
For noble metal catalysts, recent developments include the introduction of continuous catalyst regeneration (CCR) technology, allowing for stable activity over several years [10.1016/s0926-860x(01)00816-x]. Research has focused on optimizing bimetallic compositions and support materials to improve selectivity and stability [10.1016/j.jcat.2011.06.008]. For metal oxide catalysts, research has explored novel combinations and supports to enhance performance, such as sulfate and sodium treatments of silica supports [10.1016/s0926-860x(01)00816-x].

Potential advantages:
Noble metal catalysts offer high activity, long-term stability with CCR, and flexibility for different feedstocks [10.1016/s0926-860x(01)00816-x]. They can be finely tuned with promoters and supports to optimize performance [10.1016/j.jcat.2011.06.008]. Metal oxide catalysts potentially offer lower costs and good selectivity for specific reactions. Some metal oxide catalysts have shown effectiveness in the presence of CO2 as a mild oxidant, which could be advantageous for certain processes [10.1016/s0926-860x(01)00816-x].



Integrative understanding and prospective outlook: The field of light olefin dehydrogenation catalysis is evolving towards more efficient and sustainable processes. While platinum-based catalysts currently dominate industrial applications due to their superior performance, ongoing research into metal oxide catalysts shows promise for developing more cost-effective alternatives. Future research directions may include:

1. Exploring novel bimetallic or multi-metallic compositions to further enhance selectivity and stability of noble metal catalysts.
2. Developing advanced metal oxide formulations that can match or exceed the performance of platinum-based catalysts.
3. Investigating the potential of hybrid catalysts that combine the advantages of both noble metals and metal oxides.
4. Focusing on catalyst designs that minimize coke formation and extend catalyst lifetime.
5. Exploring the integration of catalytic dehydrogenation with membrane technology for in-situ product separation, potentially overcoming thermodynamic limitations.
6. Investigating the use of alternative supports or promoters to enhance catalyst performance and longevity.

These research avenues could lead to more efficient and economical processes for light olefin production, addressing the growing demand for these important chemical feedstocks while minimizing environmental impact.
