[1] "Dehydrogenation employs chromia-alumina catalysts and, more recently, platinum or modified platinum catalysts."

[2] "A different approach to catalytic dehydrogenation was first introduced in the mid-1960s for the supply of long-chain linear olefins for the production of biodegradable detergents."

[3] "In the early 1970s, UOP introduced continuous catalyst regeneration (CCR) technology that enabled noble metal catalysts to remain at their most desirable stable activity for several years without having to shut down the reactor for catalyst regeneration."

[4] "Nakagawa et al. [63] studied a series of metal oxides for ethane dehydrogenation in the presence of CO2 at 650 C, C2H6:CO2 = 5:25 ml/min and SV = 900 h1 ml (g-cat)1. The order of activity was as follows: Ga2O3 > Cr2O3 > V2O5 > TiO2 > Mn3O4 > In2O3 > ZnO > La2O3."

[5] "Wang et al. [64] of Japan studied the effect of sulfate and Na-treatment silica on the dehydrogenation of ethane with CO2 at 650 C and 1 atm. Sulfating silica (348 m2/g) with (NH4)2SO4 (and calcining at 700 C/3 h to give 2 wt.% SO42), and adding 5 wt.% Cr gave the best catalytic performance."

Noble metal-based catalysts, particularly platinum, and metal oxide-based catalysts have distinct characteristics in the nonoxidative dehydrogenation of light olefins:

Composition:
- Noble metal catalysts: Primarily platinum or modified platinum catalysts.
- Metal oxide catalysts: Include chromia-alumina, gallium oxide, chromium oxide, vanadium oxide, zinc oxide, and molybdenum oxide.

Effectiveness:
- Noble metal catalysts: Generally more effective, allowing for stable activity over longer periods.
- Metal oxide catalysts: Vary in effectiveness, with gallium oxide showing the highest activity among metal oxides studied.

Industrial applications:
- Noble metal catalysts: Widely used in commercial processes, particularly for long-chain olefin production and light paraffin dehydrogenation.
- Metal oxide catalysts: Primarily used in earlier commercial processes and still employed in some applications.

Recent developments:
- Noble metal catalysts: Introduction of continuous catalyst regeneration (CCR) technology, allowing for extended catalyst life without reactor shutdown.
- Metal oxide catalysts: Research into various compositions and treatments, such as sulfate and sodium treatments, to improve performance.

Potential advantages:
- Noble metal catalysts: Longer catalyst life, higher stability, and ability to operate at higher severities.
- Metal oxide catalysts: Potentially lower cost, ability to be tailored for specific reactions, and effectiveness in the presence of CO2 for some applications.
