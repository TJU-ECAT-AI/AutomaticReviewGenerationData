[1] "Dehydrogenation employs chromia-alumina catalysts and, more recently, platinum or modified platinum catalysts."

[2] "Important aspects in dehydrogenation entail approaching equilibrium or near-equilibrium conversions while minimizing side reactions and coke formation."

[3] "A different approach to catalytic dehydrogenation was first introduced in the mid-1960s for the supply of long-chain linear olefins for the production of biodegradable detergents."

[4] "Bloch [10] further extended this thinking by developing Pt-based catalysts that could selectively dehydrogenate long-chain linear paraffins to the corresponding internal mono-olefins with high activity and stability and with minimum cracking."

[5] "The work on catalytic reforming with noble metal (Pt) catalysts done in the 1940s by Haensel clearly demonstrated that Pt-based catalysts had high activity for the dehydrogenation of paraffins to the corresponding olefins"

[6] "Nakagawa et al. [63] studied a series of metal oxides for ethane dehydrogenation in the presence of CO2 at 650 C, C2H6:CO2 = 5:25 ml/min and SV = 900 h1 ml (g-cat)1. The order of activity was as follows: Ga2O3 > Cr2O3 > V2O5 > TiO2 > Mn3O4 > In2O3 > ZnO > La2O3."

[7] "Particularly, notable for its high selectivity to propylene is a vanadia-silica-zirconia catalyst of Rulkens and Tilley at the University of California, Berkley, CA [75]. These workers using a molecular precursor route, produced an 18/36/46 V2O5-SiO2-ZrO2 catalyst which gave 81.5% selectivity to propylene at 8% conversion of propane at 550 C."

Noble metal-based catalysts, particularly platinum, and metal oxide-based catalysts have distinct characteristics in the nonoxidative dehydrogenation of light olefins:

Composition:
- Noble metal catalysts: Primarily platinum-based, often modified or supported on alumina.
- Metal oxide catalysts: Include chromia, gallium, indium, vanadium, zinc, and molybdenum oxides, often in combination with other elements or supports.

Effectiveness:
- Platinum catalysts: High activity and selectivity for dehydrogenation, especially for long-chain paraffins.
- Metal oxide catalysts: Vary in effectiveness, with some showing high selectivity for specific reactions (e.g., vanadia-silica-zirconia for propane dehydrogenation).

Industrial applications:
- Platinum catalysts: Widely used in commercial processes like UOP's Oleflex and Pacol for light and heavy paraffin dehydrogenation.
- Metal oxide catalysts: Used in various processes, including chromia-alumina in older technologies like Catofin.

Recent developments:
- Platinum catalysts: Focus on modifications to improve selectivity and stability.
- Metal oxide catalysts: Research into novel combinations and supports to enhance performance, such as the vanadia-silica-zirconia catalyst for propane dehydrogenation.

Potential advantages:
- Platinum catalysts: High activity, stability, and selectivity, especially for long-chain paraffins.
- Metal oxide catalysts: Potential for lower cost, ability to tailor for specific reactions, and in some cases, higher selectivity for certain products.

Overall, while platinum-based catalysts dominate commercial applications due to their high performance, metal oxide catalysts continue to be an area of active research and development, offering potential alternatives and improvements in specific applications.
