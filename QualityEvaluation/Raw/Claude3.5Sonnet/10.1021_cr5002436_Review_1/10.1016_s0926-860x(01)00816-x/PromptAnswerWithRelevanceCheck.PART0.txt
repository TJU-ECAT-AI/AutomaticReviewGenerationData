[1] "Dehydrogenation employs chromia-alumina catalysts and, more recently, platinum or modified platinum catalysts."

[2] "A different approach to catalytic dehydrogenation was first introduced in the mid-1960s for the supply of long-chain linear olefins for the production of biodegradable detergents."

[3] "In the early 1970s, UOP introduced continuous catalyst regeneration (CCR) technology that enabled noble metal catalysts to remain at their most desirable stable activity for several years without having to shut down the reactor for catalyst regeneration."

[4] "The work on catalytic reforming with noble metal (Pt) catalysts done in the 1940s by Haensel clearly demonstrated that Pt-based catalysts had high activity for the dehydrogenation of paraffins to the corresponding olefins"

[5] "Nakagawa et al. [63] studied a series of metal oxides for ethane dehydrogenation in the presence of CO2 at 650 C, C2H6:CO2 = 5:25 ml/min and SV = 900 h1 ml (g-cat)1. The order of activity was as follows: Ga2O3 > Cr2O3 > V2O5 > TiO2 > Mn3O4 > In2O3 > ZnO > La2O3."

[6] "The key role of dehydrogenation catalysts is to accelerate the main reaction while controlling other reactions. Unmodified alumina-supported platinum catalysts are highly active but are not selective to dehydrogenation."

[7] "The role of platinum modifiers is to weaken the platinumolefin interaction selectively without affecting the platinumparaffin interaction. Arsenic, tin, germanium, lead, bismuth are among metals reported as platinum activity modifiers."
