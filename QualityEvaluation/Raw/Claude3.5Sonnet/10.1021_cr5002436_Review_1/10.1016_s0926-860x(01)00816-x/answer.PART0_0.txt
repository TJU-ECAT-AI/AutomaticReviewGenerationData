[1] "Dehydrogenation employs chromia-alumina catalysts and, more recently, platinum or modified platinum catalysts."

[2] "A different approach to catalytic dehydrogenation was first introduced in the mid-1960s for the supply of long-chain linear olefins for the production of biodegradable detergents."

[3] "In the early 1970s, UOP introduced continuous catalyst regeneration (CCR) technology that enabled noble metal catalysts to remain at their most desirable stable activity for several years without having to shut down the reactor for catalyst regeneration."

[4] "The work on catalytic reforming with noble metal (Pt) catalysts done in the 1940s by Haensel clearly demonstrated that Pt-based catalysts had high activity for the dehydrogenation of paraffins to the corresponding olefins"

[5] "Nakagawa et al. [63] studied a series of metal oxides for ethane dehydrogenation in the presence of CO2 at 650 C, C2H6:CO2 = 5:25 ml/min and SV = 900 h1 ml (g-cat)1. The order of activity was as follows: Ga2O3 > Cr2O3 > V2O5 > TiO2 > Mn3O4 > In2O3 > ZnO > La2O3."

[6] "The key role of dehydrogenation catalysts is to accelerate the main reaction while controlling other reactions. Unmodified alumina-supported platinum catalysts are highly active but are not selective to dehydrogenation."

[7] "The role of platinum modifiers is to weaken the platinumolefin interaction selectively without affecting the platinumparaffin interaction. Arsenic, tin, germanium, lead, bismuth are among metals reported as platinum activity modifiers."

Noble metal-based catalysts (particularly platinum) and metal oxide-based catalysts have different compositions and applications in the nonoxidative dehydrogenation of light olefins:

Composition:
- Noble metal catalysts: Primarily use platinum, often modified with elements like tin, arsenic, germanium, lead, or bismuth.
- Metal oxide catalysts: Include chromia-alumina, gallium oxide, chromium oxide, vanadium oxide, titanium oxide, manganese oxide, indium oxide, zinc oxide, and lanthanum oxide.

Effectiveness:
- Noble metal catalysts: Highly active for paraffin dehydrogenation, but require modifications to improve selectivity.
- Metal oxide catalysts: Generally less active than noble metals, but can offer good selectivity. Activity order: Ga2O3 > Cr2O3 > V2O5 > TiO2 > Mn3O4 > In2O3 > ZnO > La2O3.

Industrial applications:
- Noble metal catalysts: Widely used in commercial processes like UOP's Oleflex and Pacol for light and heavy paraffin dehydrogenation.
- Metal oxide catalysts: Chromia-alumina catalysts have been used in processes like Catofin for light paraffin dehydrogenation.

Recent developments:
- Noble metal catalysts: Introduction of continuous catalyst regeneration (CCR) technology, allowing for stable activity over several years.
- Metal oxide catalysts: Research into CO2-assisted dehydrogenation using various metal oxides.

Potential advantages:
- Noble metal catalysts: High activity, long-term stability with CCR, and flexibility for different feedstocks.
- Metal oxide catalysts: Potentially lower cost, good selectivity, and the possibility of CO2 utilization in the dehydrogenation process.
