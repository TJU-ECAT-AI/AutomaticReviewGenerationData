The given literature does not contain information to directly compare noble metal-based catalysts and metal oxide-based catalysts for light olefin dehydrogenation. The document focuses specifically on platinum and platinum-tin catalysts supported on L-zeolite for isobutane dehydrogenation. It does not discuss metal oxide catalysts like chromium, gallium, indium, vanadium, zinc or molybdenum oxides.

From the information provided, we can only comment on the platinum-based catalysts:

1. Composition: The study examines platinum supported on silica (Pt/SiO2), platinum-tin supported on silica (Pt/Sn/SiO2), and platinum-tin supported on potassium L-zeolite (Pt/Sn/K-L).

2. Effectiveness: Pt/Sn/K-L catalysts showed high activity and selectivity for isobutane dehydrogenation. They exhibited sustained activity at high temperatures (673-773 K) conducive to coking.

3. Recent developments: The addition of tin and potassium to platinum supported on L-zeolite enhances dehydrogenation activity and selectivity by decreasing the size of surface platinum ensembles.

4. Potential advantages: Pt/Sn/K-L catalysts demonstrate high resistance to deactivation and coking, which are important for industrial applications.

The document does not provide information to compare these platinum-based catalysts with metal oxide catalysts in terms of industrial applications or overall advantages in the field of light olefin dehydrogenation.

给定的文献没有直接比较贵金属基催化剂和金属氧化物基催化剂在轻烯烃脱氢方面的信息。该文档主要关注L型分子筛负载的铂和铂-锡催化剂用于异丁烷脱氢。它没有讨论金属氧化物催化剂，如铬、镓、铟、钒、锌或钼氧化物。

根据提供的信息，我们只能评论铂基催化剂：

1. 组成：研究考察了负载在二氧化硅上的铂（Pt/SiO2）、负载在二氧化硅上的铂-锡（Pt/Sn/SiO2）以及负载在钾型L分子筛上的铂-锡（Pt/Sn/K-L）。

2. 有效性：Pt/Sn/K-L催化剂显示出高活性和高选择性用于异丁烷脱氢。它们在容易结焦的高温条件下（673-773 K）表现出持续的活性。

3. 最新发展：向L型分子筛负载的铂中添加锡和钾可以通过减小表面铂集合体的尺寸来提高脱氢活性和选择性。

4. 潜在优势：Pt/Sn/K-L催化剂表现出对失活和结焦的高抗性，这对工业应用很重要。

该文档没有提供信息来比较这些铂基催化剂与金属氧化物催化剂在工业应用或轻烯烃脱氢领域的整体优势方面的对比。

The given scientific literature does not contain information to directly compare and contrast noble metal-based catalysts (particularly platinum) with metal oxide-based catalysts for light olefin dehydrogenation. The document focuses specifically on platinum and platinum-tin catalysts supported on L-zeolite for isobutane dehydrogenation. It does not discuss metal oxide catalysts like chromium, gallium, indium, vanadium, zinc or molybdenum oxides.

The literature describes platinum-based catalysts, particularly Pt/Sn supported on K-L zeolite, as highly active and selective for isobutane dehydrogenation. It mentions that adding tin and potassium to platinum decreases the size of platinum ensembles, which inhibits undesired side reactions like isomerization and hydrogenolysis. The zeolite support is also suggested to stabilize adsorbed isobutane intermediates and promote the rate-limiting dissociative adsorption step.

However, the document does not provide information to compare these platinum catalysts to metal oxide catalysts in terms of composition, effectiveness, industrial applications, or recent developments. Without additional sources, a comprehensive comparison cannot be made based solely on this literature.

给定的科学文献没有直接比较和对比贵金属基催化剂(特别是铂)与金属氧化物基催化剂用于轻烯烃脱氢的信息。该文档专门讨论了以L型分子筛为载体的铂和铂-锡催化剂用于异丁烷脱氢。它没有讨论诸如铬、镓、铟、钒、锌或钼氧化物等金属氧化物催化剂。

文献描述了以铂为基础的催化剂，特别是以K-L分子筛为载体的Pt/Sn，对异丁烷脱氢具有高活性和选择性。它提到向铂中添加锡和钾会减小铂集合体的尺寸，从而抑制了异构化和氢解等不良副反应。还提出分子筛载体可以稳定吸附的异丁烷中间体，促进限速的解离吸附步骤。

然而，该文档没有提供将这些铂催化剂与金属氧化物催化剂在组成、有效性、工业应用或最新发展方面进行比较的信息。如果没有额外的资料，仅凭这篇文献无法进行全面的比较。

3. Recent developments: The addition of tin and excess potassium to Pt/K-L catalysts enhanced dehydrogenation activity and selectivity by decreasing the size of surface platinum ensembles.

4. Potential advantages: The zeolite structure and potassium presence appear to promote isobutane adsorption, leading to higher dehydrogenation rates compared to silica-supported catalysts.

The document does not provide information to compare these aspects with metal oxide-based catalysts or discuss their industrial applications in light olefin dehydrogenation.
