Abstract
The last time I did one of these surveys,1 the sky was falling and some were even predicting brief periods for natural gas prices equal to zero, as oil producers would not even find places to store their associated natural gas. That zero did not happen, nor did gas prices break the buck, but they did find their way below the two-dollar mark.

That zero did not happen, nor did gas prices break the buck, but they did find their way below the two-dollar mark.
Now what?
COAL-TO-GAS SWITCHING STILL ON THE LIST
This subject concerns whether natural gas or coal is the economic fuel for electricity generation.
Last year, with prices dropping so low, generators were abandoning coalas much as they could, given that many had long-term contracts for coaland switching to gas. As it was foreseen at the time, subsequently with lower incentives to drill wells, supply decreased, and gas prices rose again. Now the analysts say that we should be heading back toward more coal and are even predicting a rally in gas prices (see Exhibits 1 and 2).2
Both Raymond James and Morgan Stanley, investment-banking firms, did extensive work to try to determine the natural gas price level where equilibrium would take hold again (i.e., the level at which there would be no more extensive switching).
Heavy Correlation of Prices to Switching
Raymond James analyzed coal basin by coal basin and found that the probable long-term level to prevent switching was about $4.25 a million Btu's. At that price level, only the Central Appalachian coal basin continued to lose to gas.
The company also noted that although natural gas gained an average of 4.2 billion cubic feet a day with the price switching, natural gas will also only lose about 2 billion cubic feet a day of that as prices recover. Raymond James attributed this to two factors:
1.
Utilities were forced to stay with existing coal contracts regardless of lower natural gas prices. However, the theory would go, as those contracts expire, they will be replaced with natural gas contracts (although Raymond James' report did not specifically say this).
2.
Coal plants are being retired, and many will likely be replaced by natural gas plants. On a net basis, in the long run, about 0.75 billion cubic feet a day will be added to the demand for natural gas. The report adds that many of those coal plants are older and less efficient, and that newer, more efficient plants will help provide a new upper limit for switching in the future.
The company also stressed the recent, very high correlation between coal-to-gas switching and natural gas prices:
As you can clearly see in [Exhibit 1], the coal switching equation is incredibly sensitive and tightly correlated to natural gas pricing. For example, the recent gas price rally has already begun to narrow switching levels since the max in May. Given the high correlation of gas prices to coal to gas switching (95% since 2011), we expect the trend will hold up going forward. (Note 2, Raymond James)

Weak Gas Prices Increase Gas Demand
What is interesting about these data is the 95 percent strength of the correlation, which implies that coal-to-gas switching has outweighed even weather as a determinant of natural gas pricesor at least it has in a black swan environment such as the one that industry has found itself in.
Morgan Stanley, Others Cite Switching but Also Other Factors
Morgan Stanley acknowledged that gas prices had traveled in lockstep with the amount of switching that had been undertaken, but its studies showed that at gas prices higher than $3.00 a million Btu's, the effect becomes steadily less significant (Exhibit 3). Thus, we are returning to a more normal situation, with other factors that will steadily affect prices as well. Some are positives for the natural gas price outlook, while others are negatives. One, already mentioned, was weather.
Expect continued emphasis on oil, rather than gas, drilling. The economics are just better, and producers will likely direct their efforts in that direction. With still fewer gas wells drilled, gas prices could be pushed up.
Outside of Marcellus, production prices mount. And Marcellus currently has infrastructure challenges. Beyond that, most of the plays require $4 a million Btu's to be attractive. This too pushes prices up from where they have been recently.
As winter comes, residential and commercial sectors gain importance. In the winter, these two sectors go from about 15 percent of demand to 40 or 50 percent. Thus, inventories will depend more on weather than on coal-to-gas switching.
Once bitten, producers are likely to hedge, and at lower price levels than prior years. That effect acts to put a lid on prices. Hedging is more likely in the second half of the year as the effect of winter weather wears away.
The backlog of wells and their productivity presents an unknown. Many of these wells are in plays that are relatively new and, like the Marcellus, with questionable infrastructure to support them.
Growing effect of industrial demand is a positive for prices. At these lower prices, natural gas as a feedstock seems to be growing. Noticing a recent uptick, Morgan Stanley said, While we are aware that one data point doesn't make a trend, it is possible that the industrial sector is becoming more gas-intensive (i.e., consuming more gas per unit of output).3

PRICE SPIKE FORESEEN
With what is hoped to be the end of last year's miserable conditionswarmest winter ever and a huge inventory glutRaymond James believes that the market in 2013 is
well positioned for sharply higher natural gas prices (and gas to coal switching) this winter. That means investors should expect a sharp spike in gas prices this winter and lasting into the spring. Likewise, look for a sharp y/y decrease in switching driven gas-fired generation demand beginning this winter and lasting though the spring. At the end of the day, look for gas to coal-fired switching to keep a lid on natural gas prices as we move through the second half of 2013. (Note 2, Raymond James)
On October 11, Morgan Stanley said that it believed that a rally was in process and would continue. The company damped its enthusiasm slightly in light of warm-weather forecasts. However, the company still believes that there should be a continuation of the rally into the winter. In the company's October 11 Natural Gas Comment, it said that it believed that prices could easily rally to $5.00 a million Btu's or more, but on November 29, in light of unfavorable weather forecasts, it said that the probabilities of such a spike were then near zero, regardless that the rally would continue.
One reason that the company gave for a rally was that production that follows a price hike always does so with a lag, possibly three months or so, and within that lag prices can soar. Also, the company cited inventories that should be lower with more-normal weather, squeezing prices higher into the winter.
Additionally, Moody's Investor Services chimed in with an opinion that would support Raymond James and Morgan Stanley. On November 20, Moody's noted that the recent decrease in natural gas storage has led it to increase its forecast for natural gas prices by $0.50 a million Btu's.4 Now Moody's says that it foresees gas prices to average $3.50 in 2013 and $4.00 in 2014.
THE WORLD TURNED UPSIDE DOWN
Shale gas has again shaken things up such that there is a new paradigm in the natural gas and electricity industry. Because of all the fuel switching, what was definitely a second- or third-place runner in the natural gas demand pictureuse as a fuel for electricity generationis now definitely the big dog in the room.
The annual energy market assessment by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission5 provides data that shows this change (Exhibit 4). At 26 billion cubic feet a day, electric generation uses 39 percent of natural gas; the second place now goes to residential/commercial with 19.3 billion cubic feet a day, which is 28 percent of the total. The argument could be made that Exhibit 4 shows 2012 usages, which inflate the amount of gas going to electric generation. Nevertheless, if Morgan Stanley's theory is correct that in 2013 and beyond, natural gas will retain 2.1 billion cubic feet a day of the 4.2 that it gained, even with higher natural gas prices, then electric generation should still remain the preeminent use of natural gas for the near future.
