The given literature does not contain any information about metal oxide-based catalysts for light olefin dehydrogenation. The document focuses exclusively on platinum and platinum-tin catalysts supported on silica for isobutane dehydrogenation. It does not discuss or compare other types of catalysts such as chromium, gallium, indium, vanadium, zinc or molybdenum oxides. The literature is limited to discussing the preparation methods, characterization, and performance of Pt and PtSn catalysts, as well as the effects of regeneration treatments on these specific catalyst systems.
