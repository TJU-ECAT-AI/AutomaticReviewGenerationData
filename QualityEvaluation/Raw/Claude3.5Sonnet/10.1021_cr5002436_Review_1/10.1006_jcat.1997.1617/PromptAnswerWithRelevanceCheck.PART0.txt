The given literature does not contain information to directly compare and contrast noble metal-based catalysts (particularly Platinum) with metal oxide-based catalysts for the nonoxidative dehydrogenation of light olefins. The document focuses primarily on PtSn catalysts supported on silica for isobutane dehydrogenation. It does not discuss metal oxide catalysts such as CrOx, gallium, indium, vanadium, zinc, or molybdenum oxides.

However, based on the information provided about Pt-based catalysts, we can infer some points:

1. Composition: The study discusses Pt and PtSn catalysts supported on silica. Different preparation methods (co-impregnation vs sequential impregnation) affect the degree of PtSn interaction.

2. Effectiveness: PtSn catalysts show improved activity, selectivity, and stability compared to monometallic Pt catalysts for isobutane dehydrogenation, especially under severe conditions (high temperature, absence of H2).

3. Industrial applications: The paper mentions increased demand for light olefins production for polymers and gasoline additives, suggesting industrial relevance of these catalysts.

4. Recent developments: The study highlights the importance of maximizing PtSn interaction rather than metal dispersion for sustained activity. It also discusses the effects of regeneration treatments on catalyst performance.

5. Potential advantages: PtSn catalysts show better resistance to coking and higher selectivity compared to monometallic Pt catalysts.

To properly compare these with metal oxide-based catalysts would require additional information not present in this document.

给定的文献没有直接比较和对比贵金属基催化剂（特别是铂）与金属氧化物基催化剂在轻烯烃非氧化脱氢方面的信息。该文档主要关注硅胶负载的PtSn催化剂用于异丁烷脱氢。它没有讨论诸如CrOx、镓、铟、钒、锌或钼氧化物等金属氧化物催化剂。

然而，根据所提供的关于Pt基催化剂的信息，我们可以推断出一些要点：

1. 成分：该研究讨论了硅胶负载的Pt和PtSn催化剂。不同的制备方法（共浸渍vs顺序浸渍）影响PtSn相互作用的程度。

2. 有效性：与单金属Pt催化剂相比，PtSn催化剂在异丁烷脱氢方面表现出更好的活性、选择性和稳定性，特别是在严苛条件下（高温，无H2）。

3. 工业应用：该论文提到了用于聚合物和汽油添加剂生产的轻烯烃需求增加，表明这些催化剂具有工业相关性。

4. 最新发展：该研究强调了最大化PtSn相互作用而非金属分散度对持续活性的重要性。它还讨论了再生处理对催化剂性能的影响。

5. 潜在优势：与单金属Pt催化剂相比，PtSn催化剂表现出更好的抗结焦性和更高的选择性。

要正确比较这些与金属氧化物基催化剂，需要本文档中不存在的额外信息。

The given literature does not contain any information about metal oxide-based catalysts for light olefin dehydrogenation. The document focuses exclusively on platinum and platinum-tin catalysts supported on silica for isobutane dehydrogenation. It does not discuss or compare other types of catalysts such as chromium, gallium, indium, vanadium, zinc or molybdenum oxides. The literature is limited to discussing the preparation methods, characterization, and performance of Pt and PtSn catalysts, as well as the effects of regeneration treatments on these specific catalyst systems.

The document focuses specifically on PtSn catalysts for isobutane dehydrogenation and does not discuss metal oxide catalysts like CrOx, gallium, indium, vanadium, zinc, or molybdenum oxides. 

However, based on the information provided about Pt-based catalysts, we can infer some points about their effectiveness and properties:

1. Platinum-based catalysts, particularly when promoted with Sn, can be highly effective for alkane dehydrogenation reactions.

2. PtSn catalysts show improved selectivity, stability and resistance to coking compared to monometallic Pt catalysts.

3. The preparation method significantly impacts the performance of PtSn catalysts, with co-impregnation methods generally producing better results than sequential impregnation.

4. PtSn catalysts can be sensitive to high-temperature oxidative treatments, which may disrupt the alloy structure and decrease catalytic performance.

5. Characterization of active sites on PtSn catalysts can be challenging, as traditional chemisorption measurements may not accurately reflect the number of active sites.

Without information on metal oxide catalysts, a full comparison cannot be made. Further research would be needed to compare the compositions, effectiveness, industrial applications, recent developments, and potential advantages of noble metal vs. metal oxide catalysts for light olefin dehydrogenation.

然而，根据提供的关于Pt基催化剂的信息，我们可以推断出一些关于它们的有效性和性质的要点：

1. 铂基催化剂，特别是当与Sn一起使用时，可以在烷烃脱氢反应中高效发挥作用。

2. PtSn催化剂相比单一金属Pt催化剂表现出更好的选择性、稳定性和抗积碳能力。

3. 制备方法显著影响PtSn催化剂的性能，共浸渍法通常比序贯浸渍法产生更好的结果。

4. PtSn催化剂对高温氧化处理敏感，这可能会破坏合金结构并降低催化性能。

5. PtSn催化剂活性位点的表征具有挑战性，因为传统的化学吸附测量可能无法准确反映活性位点的数量。

由于缺乏关于金属氧化物催化剂的信息，无法进行全面比较。需要进一步研究才能比较贵金属与金属氧化物催化剂在轻烯烃脱氢中的成分、有效性、工业应用、最新发展和潜在优势。

The given literature does not contain information to directly compare and contrast noble metal-based catalysts with metal oxide-based catalysts for light olefin dehydrogenation. The document focuses specifically on platinum-tin catalysts supported on silica for isobutane dehydrogenation. It does not discuss other metal oxide catalysts like chromium, gallium, indium, vanadium, zinc or molybdenum oxides.

The literature provides detailed information on platinum-based catalysts, particularly:

1. Composition: Platinum-tin bimetallic catalysts supported on silica, with varying Pt:Sn ratios and preparation methods.

2. Effectiveness: PtSn catalysts show improved activity, selectivity and stability compared to monometallic Pt catalysts for isobutane dehydrogenation, especially under severely deactivating conditions (high temperature, absence of H2).

3. Recent developments: The study investigates effects of preparation methods, regeneration treatments, and PtSn interaction on catalyst performance. Co-impregnation methods, especially using HCl solvent, produce catalysts with higher PtSn interaction and better performance than sequential impregnation.

4. Potential advantages: PtSn catalysts exhibit higher resistance to coking and deactivation compared to Pt-only catalysts. The alloyed PtSn phase is responsible for sustained catalytic activity.

However, the document does not provide information to compare these aspects with metal oxide-based catalysts or discuss their relative industrial applications in the dehydrogenation of light olefins.

文献提供了关于铂基催化剂的详细信息，特别是：

1. 成分：二氧化硅负载的铂-锡双金属催化剂，具有不同的Pt:Sn比例和制备方法。

2. 有效性：与单金属Pt催化剂相比，PtSn催化剂在异丁烷脱氢方面表现出更好的活性、选择性和稳定性，尤其是在严重失活条件下（高温、无H2）。

3. 最新发展：该研究调查了制备方法、再生处理和PtSn相互作用对催化剂性能的影响。共浸渍方法，特别是使用HCl溶剂的方法，生产出具有更高PtSn相互作用和更好性能的催化剂，优于顺序浸渍法。

4. 潜在优势：与仅Pt催化剂相比，PtSn催化剂表现出更高的抗积炭和抗失活能力。合金化的PtSn相负责持续的催化活性。

然而，该文档没有提供与金属氧化物基催化剂比较这些方面的信息，也没有讨论它们在轻质烯烃脱氢中的相对工业应用。

The given literature does not contain information to directly compare noble metal-based catalysts like platinum with metal oxide-based catalysts for light olefin dehydrogenation. The document focuses specifically on platinum-tin catalysts supported on silica for isobutane dehydrogenation. It does not discuss other metal oxide catalysts like chromium, gallium, indium, vanadium, zinc or molybdenum oxides.

The literature provides details on platinum-tin catalysts, including:

1. Platinum-tin catalysts show improved activity, selectivity and stability compared to monometallic platinum catalysts for isobutane dehydrogenation, especially in the absence of added hydrogen.

2. The degree of platinum-tin interaction strongly affects catalyst performance. Co-impregnation methods lead to better platinum-tin interaction than sequential impregnation.

3. High-temperature oxidation treatments can disrupt the platinum-tin alloy structure and negatively impact catalyst performance.

4. Chemisorption measurements (H2, CO) on platinum-tin catalysts primarily probe unalloyed platinum sites, which rapidly deactivate, rather than the alloyed sites responsible for sustained activity.

While this information is valuable for understanding platinum-tin catalysts, the document does not provide a basis for comparing them to metal oxide catalysts for light olefin dehydrogenation. A more comprehensive literature review would be needed to address the question fully.

给定的文献并未包含直接比较贵金属催化剂(如铂)与金属氧化物催化剂用于轻质烯烃脱氢的信息。该文档主要关注硅胶负载的铂-锡催化剂用于异丁烷脱氢。它没有讨论其他金属氧化物催化剂,如铬、镓、铟、钒、锌或钼的氧化物。

文献提供了关于铂-锡催化剂的详细信息,包括:

1. 与单金属铂催化剂相比,铂-锡催化剂在异丁烷脱氢反应中表现出更好的活性、选择性和稳定性,特别是在没有额外加入氢气的情况下。

2. 铂-锡相互作用的程度强烈影响催化剂性能。共浸渍法比序列浸渍法能够获得更好的铂-锡相互作用。

3. 高温氧化处理可能会破坏铂-锡合金结构,对催化剂性能产生负面影响。

4. 在铂-锡催化剂上进行的化学吸附测量(H2、CO)主要探测未合金化的铂位点,这些位点会快速失活,而不是负责持续活性的合金位点。

虽然这些信息对于理解铂-锡催化剂很有价值,但该文档并不能提供将其与金属氧化物催化剂在轻质烯烃脱氢方面进行比较的基础。要全面回答这个问题,需要进行更广泛的文献综述。
