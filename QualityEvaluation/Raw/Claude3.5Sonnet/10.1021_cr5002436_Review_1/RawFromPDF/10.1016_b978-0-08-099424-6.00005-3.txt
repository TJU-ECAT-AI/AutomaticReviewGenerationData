5.1 INTRODUCTION
The bitumen present in oilsands and oil shale is strongly associated
with mineral matter. Bitumen is defined as petroleum with a density
greater than 1000 kgm23. It does not have the fluidity of conventional
crude oil and the bitumen cannot be recovered through conventional
drilling and oil production. The bitumen in Canadian oilsands deposits
is not in direct contact with the mineral matter, but for the most part
the bitumen is separated from the mineral matter by a thin surface
coating of water (Figure 5.1) [1,2]. This is fortunate, because it makes
separation of the bitumen from the mineral matter easier and the bitu-
men can be recovered by solvent extraction, with water being the main
solvent used industrially. Unfortunately, this is not the case for all of the
oilsands deposits around the world. In oil shale (Chapter 6) the organic
material is in direct contact with the mineral matter. The bitumen content
of oil shale, based on solvent extraction as the criterion, is very low. Most
of the organics in oil shale are insoluble kerogen, a polymeric material,
and shale oil can only be recovered by retorting [2,3]. Producing bitumen
from oilsands is consequently less energy intensive than producing shale
oil from oil shale.
The two largest oilsands deposits in the world are located in
Venezuela and in Canada [46]. The Venezuelan deposits are located

north of the Orinoco River. These deposits have higher fluidity at
reservoir conditions than the Canadian deposits so that it can be
recovered as heavy oil using conventional oil drilling adapted for
heavy oil. Most of the Canadian oilsands are in the province of Alberta
and are concentrated in three regions: Athabasca-Wabiskaw, Cold Lake
and Peace River. The fluidity of the bitumen at reservoir conditions is
very low and the bitumen cannot be recovered using conventional oil
recovery practices. In addition to the large deposits in Venezuela and
Canada, oilsands deposits occur globally in conjunction with deeper
petroleum deposits in most petroleum-producing regions. There are
significant resources in West and Central Africa, Kazakhstan, Trinidad,
and in the United States.
Once the bitumen is produced, it can be upgraded and ultimately
refined to final products that are of use to society, such as transport fuels
[7,8]. Native bitumen also has use in road construction and as building
materials [9], although these are minor applications for oilsands derived
bitumen, which is mainly used in energy production.
The subsequent discussion will focus on Canadian oilsands and
oilsands-derived bitumen, because it highlights the challenges that are
related to bitumen composition and lack of bitumen fluidity.
5.2 BITUMEN PRODUCTION FROM OILSANDS
Bitumen is recovered from Canadian oilsands in two ways. Deposits
that are close to the surface employ surface mining to recover the
oilsands, which are then extracted to recover the bitumen. Deposits
that are deeper employ in situ extraction to recover the bitumen.
Mining of oilsands can be considered to a depth of 75 m. The in situ
extraction of oilsands requires depths of 200 m or more. At present there
is no economical technology for the recovery of bitumen from oilsands
deposits that are (75200) m below the surface.

5.2.1 Extraction of Mined Oilsands
Open pit mining is the most economical recovery method of oilsands
deposits that are close to the surface. Even with deposits close to the
surface, there is some overburden material that does not contain
oilsands, and that must be removed prior to recovery of the oilsands
ore. The cost of mining increases as the ratio of the height of the over-
burden material to the height of the oilsands ore layer increases. This
ratio is also called the strip ratio. Oilsands mining operations have strip
ratios mostly in the range (0.41.4) [10]. The quality of the oilsands ore
varies and the cut-off for economic recovery is presently 6 wt% bitumen
[1,4]. In future, this may well change.
A block flow diagram illustrating the extraction process to recover
bitumen from mined oilsands is given in Figure 5.2.
Bitumen extraction from the oilsands ore is performed using the
Clark hot water extraction process. In this process, oilsands ore and
water slurry are prepared, usually with the addition of some caustic
(NaOH) to increase the pH. The optimum pH value is around 8.5 [4].
The extraction temperature is a critical process parameter, because
it influences the bitumen liberation rate, the ultimate bitumen recovery
and the utility cost (energy for heating) associated with bitumen extrac-
tion. There is a step-change in the recovery of bitumen as the water
temperature is increased from (25 to 35)C [1]. The lowest practical tem-
perature for stable industrial bitumen extraction is 35C. Time is
required for the extraction to take place. If the extraction facility is close
to the mine, then agitating the slurry in rotary tumblers provides the

necessary residence time for the extraction. If the extraction is far from
the mine, extraction can take place in the slurry pipeline used to trans-
port the slurry from the mining site to the extraction facility. The overall
recovery of bitumen from the oilsands ore is better than 90 %.
The density of bitumen is close to that of water. In order to facilitate
gravity phase separation, the extracted slurry must be aerated to sepa-
rate the bitumen as a froth phase from the water and mineral matter.
Separation is performed by froth flotation of the bitumen. The froth is
de-aerated before further treatment. De-aerated bitumen froth contains
around 60 % bitumen, 30 % water and 10 % mineral matter. The bitu-
men is recovered from the froth by solvent addition. The froth is a
water-in oil emulsion contaminated with solids, and the role of the sol-
vent addition is to break the emulsion as much as possible. The density
difference of the diluted bitumen mixture and the water allows for the
separation of the two phases. The diluted bitumen is sold as a product
and any solvent that remains in the water phase is recovered and
reused in the process. The solvent employed in this process is either
naphtha, which is naphthenic solvent, or a lighter paraffinic solvent,
such as hexane. These two approaches are different in a number of
respects (Table 5.1) [10]. When paraffinic solvent extraction is performed,
some precipitation of asphaltenes takes place during the bitumen
recovery process. Paraffinic froth treatment therefore doubles as a solvent
deasphalting process. The diluted bitumen that is produced by paraffinic
froth treatment also contains less residual water and mineral matter
when compared to the bitumen produced using naphtha.
The residual tailings product consists mainly of mineral matter and
water, which is treated to recover most of the water for reuse in the

the total water requirement [1]. Treatment of the process-affected water

hot water extraction. Although the concentration of dissolved organic
material in the process-affected water is only of the order of magnitude
100 mgL21, the dissolved naphthenic acids are the main cause of water
toxicity.
5.2.2 In Situ Production
When oilsands deposits are too deep, mining methods to recover the
ore for extraction becomes uneconomical. In order to recover bitumen
from deeper oilsands deposits, the bitumen must be recovered without
removing the mineral matter. The main challenge to the in situ produc-
tion of the bitumen is finding an economical way to increase the fluidity
of the bitumen, which is very viscous. The viscosity of the bitumen
can be decreased by increasing the temperature or by dissolving the
bitumen in a light solvent. Once the bitumen is fluid enough, it can
be recovered from an oil well, analogous to conventional crude oil
recovery.
Cyclic steam stimulation (CSS) was developed first as a method for
the in situ production of bitumen from deeper oilsands deposits. This
technique is still used when the reservoir has poor vertical permeability.
Steam displacement is not primarily used just because the bitumen is
immobile at reservoir temperatures. Later on the steam-assisted gravity
drainage (SAGD, pronounced sag-dee) method was developed and it is
currently the dominant in situ production technique.
For SAGD production two horizontal wells are drilled in the oilsands
ore layer, one about 5 m above the other (Figure 5.3). The top well is used
for steam injection and the bottom well is used for bitumen recovery. The
wells are equipped with a slotted liner or a fine wire mesh screen to limit
the ingress of small particulates into the well. Production from a SAGD
well pair involves the continuous injection of steam through the injection
well. As the temperature of the surrounding oilsands deposit increases,
the bitumen becomes less viscous and it can flow by gravity drainage
into the production well. The bitumen is recovered as a mixture with
water and fine mineral matter that passed through the well screens.
The mixture typically contains (2530) % bitumen, (7075) % water and
99
5.2 BITUMEN PRODUCTION FROM OILSANDS
II. FOSSIL FUELS (ENERGY SOURCES)
1 % mineral matter. After separation of the bitumen from the water, the
water is cleaned and part of the water is recycled.
The estimated production life of a SAGD well pair is around 15 years,
with an ultimate bitumen recovery of (7080) % for continuous steam
feed production and (2030) % for CSS. The steam to oil ratio required
for SAGD bitumen production is typically (23) m3m23 on a liquid
volume basis. For a steam to oil ratio of 2.5, the SAGD energy require-
ment is 6.9 GJm23 bitumen [10].
Production from in situ technologies comprises approximately half of
the Canadian production from the oilsands. This fraction is expected
to grow with time because 80 % of the reserves are accessible only by
in situ methods.
The industry standards for in situ bitumen production from oilsands
are CSS and SAGD, but these are not the only technologies. Several
new technologies are being tested with the objective of increasing pro-
ductivity, reducing energy use, reducing greenhouse gas intensity and/
or reducing water use:
a. Adding solvents to steam, to take advantage of both thermal
and dilution effects, in order to reduce bitumen viscosity (e.g.
Nexenâs ES-SAGD process, Imperial Oilâs LASER process for CSS,
and Cenovus SAP). Steam plus solvent co-feeding is already in
commercial use.
b. The use of solvents and electromagnetic heating, to preferentially
heat the bitumen (e.g. Nexenâs ESEIH process).
c. The use of mixtures of steam plus oxygen to heat the bitumen by
oxidising residual bitumen left behind in the steam-swept zone of
the reservoir (e.g. Nexenâs SAGDOX process).

d. Employing vaporised light hydrocarbons, such as propane, to extract
the bitumen from the oilsands ore (e.g. Vapex process). This is a
variation on the SAGD principle, but it uses light hydrocarbons
instead of steam.
e. Another approach is to employ in situ combustion or low
temperature oxidation, where air is injected to oxidise part of the
bitumen. The hot combustion gases then provide the necessary heat
to increase the bitumen fluidity and the bitumen is produced in an
analogous way to SAGD. An example is Petrobankâs THAI process
(toe-to-heel air injection).
5.3 TRANSPORT FUEL PRODUCTION
FROM BITUMEN
Bitumen, like conventional crude oil, is useful only once it has been
refined to transport fuels (or petrochemicals). Unlike conventional
crude oil, oilsands-derived bitumen cannot be easily transported in
its native recovered state, except in heated pipelines or railcars over
limited distances. Generally speaking, there are four approaches that
can be followed to transport and convert bitumen, which differ based
on logistics and infrastructure requirements:
a. Transport the bitumen by pipeline to a crude oil refinery designed to
process heavy crude oil and refine the bitumen with other crude oils to final
products. The bitumen on its own is too viscous to be transported by
pipeline and it has to be diluted to increase fluidity. The diluents
employed are petroleum-derived naphtha and natural gas
condensates. A mixture of 25:75 diluent and bitumen can be
transported by pipeline and it is called âdilbitâ, or diluted bitumen
[1]. In the winter months the ratio required for sufficient fluidity can
be as high as 35:65 diluent to bitumen ratio. The main advantages
of producing dilbit is that it can exploit existing heavy oil refining
capacity and it requires little additional capital investment at
the production site beyond that needed to produce the bitumen.
The main disadvantages of this approach are that it reduces
pipeline capacity by (2535) % and it requires a return pipeline for
the diluent in order to produce the dilbit.
b. Partially upgrade the bitumen close to the production site to meet pipeline
specifications and then transport the upgraded bitumen by pipeline to a
heavy oil refinery to produce final products. Ideally the bitumen can be
upgraded at the production site using a field upgrader. Only a
limited degree of thermal upgrading (visbreaking) is required to
make the bitumen fluid enough to be suitable for pipeline transport.
101
5.3 TRANSPORT FUEL PRODUCTION FROM BITUMEN
II. FOSSIL FUELS (ENERGY SOURCES)
However, the application of field upgrading has thus far been
undermined by product stability, which is related to the
impracticality of economically producing H2 on small scale, or
technology that can address product stability without H2. The main
advantage of this approach compared to the production of dilbit
is that the upgraded bitumen does not require diluent to be
transported. In other respects, it is very similar to dilbit production.
c. Partially upgrade the bitumen close to the production site to produce a
light synthetic crude oil, which can then be transported by pipeline to
a conventional oil refinery to produce final products. Bitumen can be
transported over short distances and then be upgraded in a
centralised large-scale upgrader that is further away from the
production site. Centralised upgraders are oil refineries that
produce an intermediate product, often called âsynthetic crude oilâ
(SCO). The SCO resembles benchmark crude oils and can be refined
in most crude oil refineries designed to refine light crude oils. The
main advantages of producing SCO are the higher realisation price
versus selling unprocessed bitumen and that the product does not
require diluent to be transported by pipeline, thus reducing overall
operating costs. A further advantage is that SCO does not have
to be processed in heavy crude oil refineries and most existing
conventional crude oil refining capacity can be exploited. The main
disadvantages of this approach are that centralised upgraders are
capital intensive and that the well-to-wheels environmental footprint
associated with SCO production, transport and remote refining is
larger when compared to single site refining of the bitumen to
final products.
d. Refine bitumen close to the production site to produce final products.
This is not an alternative that has thus far been seriously considered
or implemented, unless Edmonton is considered as âcloseâ (400 km)
to the oilsands production sites. The key difference between
upgrading and refining is the nature of the products that are
produced and sold. In an upgrader, the product is an upgraded
crude oil that is sold to a refinery; in a refinery the products are
transport fuels sold to the fuels distribution network. The main
advantages of producing final products are that it enables maximum
value addition to the feed and the products can be sold in the
global transport fuel market. The main disadvantages of producing
final products are that the marketing logistics is more complex,
and it requires a high capital investment and it does not exploit
existing idle refining capacity. Further, it is not clear that the
incremental increase in product value can offset the additional
capital and operating cost associated with bitumen to final
product refining in a new facility.

Presently, most of the oilsands-derived bitumen that is produced is
sold as either dilbit, or SCO.
5.4 BITUMEN CHARACTERISATION
5.4.1 Properties of Bitumen
The properties of oilsands-derived bitumen vary depending on the
location and the quality of the ore body. For an extensive discussion on
the properties and chemistry of bitumen, the reader is referred to the book
by Strausz and Lown [4]. Typical properties of bitumen are compared
with those of conventional benchmark crude oils in Table 5.2 [5,1315].
There are some notable differences that have implications for upgrading
and refining of the bitumen:
a. Density. Bitumen is classified as heavy or extra heavy oil based on
its density. It indicates that the bitumen contains a high content
of cyclic structures (aromatics and naphthenes), a lack of paraffins
(n-alkanes), and significant sulphur and nitrogen species. The
absence of paraffinic compounds is due to the severe biodegradation
of the precursor crude oils to bitumen, which preferentially removed
the lower molar mass species and the high-hydrogen content, low
density components. The high aromatic and naphthenic content is
also reflected in the low H:C ratio, which is around 1.5 on an atom
basis, as well as in the high Conradson carbon residue (CCR) value.
The latter is much more due to boiling point and the polynuclear
aromatic content than aromatics per se; benzene gives no CCR.
Hence, more refining effort is required to produce final products
from bitumen than from conventional crude oils.
b. Viscosity. The high viscosity of bitumen, possibly more than any
other property, sets bitumen production (Section 5.2) and bitumen
transport (Section 5.3) apart from that of conventional crude oil.
c. Sulphur content. The overall sulphur content is high, and around
60 % of the sulphur in bitumen is present as thiophenic sulphur
[16]. Thiophenic sulphur is more difficult to remove by
hydrodesulphurisation than sulphur that is present in mercaptans
(thiols) and sulphides (thioethers). Bitumens contain no thiols unless
they have been thermally altered during production. Sulphides give
some release of hydrogen sulphide during thermal cracking, but the
conversions are low.
d. Nitrogen and oxygen content. Although the nitrogen and oxygen
contents are lower than the sulphur content, these values are still on
the high side when compared to conventional crude oils. The basic
nitrogen compounds are responsible for acid catalyst inhibition
103
5.4 BITUMEN CHARACTERISATION
II. FOSSIL FUELS (ENERGY SOURCES)
during refining, and for inhibiting the removal of sulphur during
hydrotreating. The high oxygenate content goes hand in hand with a
high total acid number (TAN).
e. Metals content. In addition to fine mineral matter that is present in
the bitumen, the bitumen also contains higher levels of Ni and V in
organic form than most conventional crude oils. This makes it
challenging to employ heterogeneous catalysts and packed bed
reactor technology for bitumen upgrading.

5.4.2 Asphaltenes
Bitumen can be separated into different classes by paraffin precipitation
of the asphaltenes, followed by column chromatography (Table 5.3) [5].
It can be seen that bitumen contains a significant fraction of asphaltenes,
more than 10 wt% of the total bitumen. To put this into perspective, the
total asphaltenes content of Brent is (0.60.7) wt% and the vacuum resi-
due fraction ( . 550C boiling material) has an asphaltene content of only
2.05% [15].
Asphaltenes are the heaviest and most polar molecular components
of petroleum or coal and it is defined as a solubility class of materials
that are insoluble in paraffins (usually n-pentane or n-heptane) but solu-
ble in aromatic solvents such as toluene. The asphaltenes consist pri-
marily of carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, and sulphur, as well as
trace amounts of vanadium and nickel. The H:C ratio of petroleum
derived asphaltenes is approximately (1.11.2), depending on the
asphaltene source and the solvent used for precipitation. The molar mass
of asphaltenes is difficult to determine due to their strong tendency to self-
aggregate, but current understanding has determined a distribution in the
range of (400 to 2000) gmol21.
Asphaltenes are a problem due to their tendency to associate and
precipitate during oil production, upgrading and refining. They reduce
oil flow or even cause blockages during production and have severe
drawbacks during the processing of heavy ends such as the tendency to
form coke deposits in heat exchangers and reactors, and to deactivate
or poison catalysts. Changes in pressure, temperature, and/or composi-
tion can also cause precipitation of asphaltenes. In addition, when
condensate is used as a diluent with heavy oils to facilitate separation
from water or mineral matter or to reduce viscosity, asphaltenes deposi-
tion can also occur in surface facilities and pipelines. The latter is

5.4 BITUMEN CHARACTERISATION
II. FOSSIL FUELS (ENERGY SOURCES)
not normally a problem  all the Canadian bitumens require much
more than (2530) vol. % condensate (paraffins) to give precipitation.
Nevertheless, industrially, precipitation of asphaltenes is still observed
during operation and the asphaltenes accumulate in the rag layer
of treaters and foul heat exchanger surfaces and other equipment.
One possible explanation is that at the point of condensate injection,
localised high condensate to bitumen ratios create the conditions for
asphaltenes to precipitate.
The aggregating nature of asphaltenes at ambient conditions may
be related to the formation of toluene-insoluble âcokeâ during high-
temperature processing, but the driving forces for aggregation as a
function of temperature are still not well understood [17]. As heavy
petroleum fractions are reacted at high temperatures of (400550)C,
large aromatic ring groups form and associate to form a new phase
called âmesophaseâ due to its liquid crystalline properties. The compo-
nents of this mesophase are large aromatics formed by reaction, which
associate to give molecularly aligned material that is optically active
and distinct under cross-polarised light. The relationship between coke,
an insoluble carbon-rich fraction with less than (56) % hydrogen by
weight, and mesophase, is complex [18].
5.5 BITUMEN UPGRADING PROCESSES
It does not matter what strategy is followed to produce transport
fuels from bitumen (Section 5.3), there are some specific transformations
that are required to make the bitumen amenable to conventional oil
refining processes. The upgrading challenges are directly related to the
properties of the bitumen compared to conventional crude oil. The
main upgrading challenges are as follows:
a. Decrease the boiling point distribution. The main transport fuels,
gasoline, jet fuel and diesel fuel, all fall roughly within the normal
boiling point range of (35350)C. Bitumen contains ,20% straight
run naphtha and distillate that are already within the desired boiling
range, whereas benchmark crudes contain (6070) % (Table 5.2). On
a molecular level, this requires conversion to reduce the molecular
size of the compounds in the bitumen. Additionally it is necessary to
reduce aggregation, which causes the molecules to behave as if their
molecular size is more than that of the individual molecules.
b. Decrease the heteroatom content. Transport fuels have strict limitations
on sulphur content. In many countries the maximum allowable
sulphur content in gasoline and diesel fuel is (1015) Âµgg21. This
requires extensive desulphurisation, since the bitumen contains
106
5. UNCONVENTIONAL OIL AND GAS: OILSANDS
II. FOSSIL FUELS (ENERGY SOURCES)
around 5 wt % sulphur, which is an order of magnitude more than
benchmark crudes (Table 5.2). Although nitrogen and oxygen
does not have to be removed to the same level as sulphur, the
nitrogen- and oxygen-containing compounds make bitumen more
difficult to refine. These heteroatoms contribute to the aggregation
behaviour of bitumen. It is therefore required to remove most of
the heteroatoms from the bitumen.
c. Increase the H:C ratio. An increase in H:C ratio goes hand in hand
with a decrease in the aromatic content and to a lesser extent also
a decrease in the naphthenic content. Bitumen has a H:C ratio of 1.5,
whereas transport fuels have H:C ratios within the range 1.82.0.
The high aromatic and naphthenic content of bitumen makes it
difficult to meet fuel specifications for jet fuel and diesel fuel. These
compounds have high densities. Polynuclear aromatics in particular
have been implicated in soot formation during combustion. The
polynuclear aromatic content of jet fuel and diesel fuel is either
directly or indirectly regulated. The density range of jet fuel and
the density of diesel fuel in countries with fuel specifications based
on the European standards are also regulated. In addition to the
specification-related reasons for reducing the density, there is also
an economic reason. Fuels are sold on a volumetric basis. By
decreasing the density through an increase in H:C ratio, the potential
income that can be derived from the product is increased, both in
terms of quality and in terms of volume.
d. Increase fluidity. Bitumen is very viscous, many orders of magnitude
more than benchmark crude oils (Table 5.2). The impact of this
on bitumen recovery and transport has already been discussed
(Sections 5.2 and 5.3). Fluidity is also regulated by fuel
specifications, but in most cases the viscosity of refined products
is close to the fuel specifications once the other properties meet
specification. The need to decrease viscosity and improve fluidity
is therefore primarily an issue related to bitumen recovery
and transport.
Processes that can be employed for the upgrading of heavy oils and
residual were reviewed in the literature [7,19]. The major conversion
processes employed for the upgrading of bitumen are visbreaking,
coking and residue hydroconversion. These processes will be briefly
discussed to show how and why they are used for bitumen upgrading.
5.5.1 Visbreaking
Visbreaking, or mild thermal cracking, is a residue upgrading
technology that was developed to reduce the viscosity of fuel oil. It is
107
5.5 BITUMEN UPGRADING PROCESSES

one of the major residue upgrading technologies and about a third of
the global production of residue is processed through visbreaking
units [20]. It is an uncomplicated process and consists of a tube fur-
nace that doubles as heater and reactor, which is sometimes followed
by a process vessel, called a âsoakerâ, to increase the overall residence
time of the material (Figure 5.4). There is no catalyst involved and
the thermal cracking proceeds by a free-radical mechanism. Typical
operating ranges are (430490)C, (0.51.2) MPa and residence time
of (115) min [21]. After the furnace, or the soaking drum when pres-
ent, the temperature of the product is decreased by quenching which
stops further thermal cracking. In the final step of the process, the
product is fractionated.
Mild thermal cracking causes a decrease in the boiling point distribu-
tion and an increase in the fluidity of the oil. The relevance of visbreaking
to bitumen upgrading is clear. It provides a way in which the bitumen can
be converted into a less viscous product, while some lighter products are
co-produced. The process is not sensitive to the high metals, heteroatom
or aromatic content of the bitumen, even though the cracking severity has
to be limited to limit coking in the process and to ensure that the products
are stable to avoid precipitation of solids.
Generally visbreaking of bitumen alone is not sufficient to meet
the requirements for pipeline transport, which are lowered density and
lowered viscosity. For a 1015 kgm23 (8API) bitumen, the limit to vis-
breaking occurs when the asphaltenes in the product begin to precipitate.
This usually occurs when viscosity is still well above the requirement
of 350 cSt at pipeline temperature. The density change with visbreaking
is small, so that the product density would only decrease to around
1000 kgm23 (10API). Thermal cracking alone will not decrease the
density to the target of 940 kgm23 (19API) required by North
American pipelines. In order to decrease the density an additional pro-
cessing step is needed, for example, combining solvent deasphalting
with visbreaking of the deasphalted oil.

5.5.2 Coking
Coking is the prototypical carbon-rejection process. It is well suited
for the upgrading heavy oils and residua with a high CCR value, as
is the case with bitumen (Table 5.2). There are two classes of coking
technology employed industrially, namely, delayed coking and fluid
coking [22,23].
Delayed coking is the most widely used. The process configuration
of a delayed coking unit resembles that of visbreaking (Figure 5.4), but
the operation is more severe  slightly higher temperature and much
longer residence time. In a delayed coking process the feed is heated in
a furnace to cracking temperature, typically (485505)C, and it is then
injected into a process vessel called the coking drum (Figure 5.5). In the
coking drum, the thermal cracking reactions proceed over a period of
several hours to produce coke and volatile lighter products. There is
no catalyst involved and the thermal cracking and coking reactions
proceed by a free-radical mechanism. The lighter products are fraction-
ated downstream from the coking drum. The coke is a solid material
and it is periodically removed from the coking drum. Two coking
drums are operated in parallel and are alternated between batch-mode
coking and cleaning operation.
Fluid coking employs the same reaction chemistry, but instead of
coking in a drum, coke is allowed to continuously build up in particu-
late form in a fluidised bed reactor. The operating temperature is
around (500540)C [24], which is higher than in delayed coking and
it is a continuous process with respect to both coking and product
separation.
Irrespective of the technology, by allowing sufficient residence time
for the thermal cracking reactions to produce coke, the light products
are more substantially upgraded. The upgrading can be explained in
terms of disproportionation. The boiling point of part of the material is

decreased to produce distillate, naphtha and gas, whereas the rest
of the material is turned into coke, which is a solid. The metal and het-
eroatom content of the lighter products is decreased relative to the com-
position of the feed, whereas that of the coke is increased. Hydrogen is
disproportionated so that the lighter products have a higher H:C ratio
than the feed and the coke becomes more aromatic with a lower H:C
ratio than the feed. Overall the upgrading challenge is met by rejecting
a carbon-rich material (coke), which contains a large proportion of the
metals and heteroatoms and a small proportion of the hydrogen. Thus
carbon is sacrificed (carbon-rejection) instead of requiring hydrogen
to be added (hydrogen-addition) to the feed to accomplish the same
upgrading goals.
5.5.3 Residue Hydroconversion
Hydroconversion involves hydrogen-addition and it is the most com-
monly applied conversion technology to reduce the heteroatom content
of petroleum feedstocks and to increase the H:C ratio of the products.
Hydrogen-addition is metal-catalysed and it can be combined with ther-
mal or acid catalysed cracking to decrease the boiling point distribution
of the feed. In these processes, a number of factors contribute to the
reduction in the boiling point of the products relative to the feed, which
is how conversion is determined. The bulk of the conversion, normally
in the range of 70%, is due to thermal cracking of large molecules in
the feed. This level of conversion is achieved at the process conditions
whether the catalyst is active or not. The next largest contribution is
from sulphur removal, which reduces the boiling point of the products
significantly, even without cracking or removal of aromatic rings.
Finally, hydrogenation of aromatic rings contributes to the reduction in
boiling point. The final contribution is most difficult to quantify, which
is the increase in thermal cracking reactivity due to the hydrogenation
of large aromatic rings. The aromatic rings themselves are not reactive,
but large cyclic hydrogenated rings have some reactivity for thermal
cracking; therefore, at high conversion the thermal cracking of hydroge-
nated intermediates may contribute to the overall conversion of the
material boiling over 524C.
Residue hydroconversion refers to technologies that were specifically
developed for heavy feed materials, such as bitumen. There are important
differences between residue hydroconversion [8,25] and the hydroproces-
sing technologies employed during conventional oil refining:
a. It is impractical to employ fixed bed reactors for residue
hydroconversion, because the feed readily leads to the formation
of deposits that leads to increase in pressure drop. In addition
110
5. UNCONVENTIONAL OIL AND GAS: OILSANDS
II. FOSSIL FUELS (ENERGY SOURCES)
to feed fouling, mineral matter may also be present in the feed.
Technologies for residue hydroconversion therefore requires moving
bed, ebullated bed or slurry bed reactors. Only the lighter fractions
from residue upgrading can be hydro-processed in fixed bed
reactors.
b. The fouling nature of the feed, combined with the high metals
content, results in a higher catalyst deactivation rate. Continuous
catalyst replacement and/or regeneration are necessary in order
to maintain continuous operation over extended time periods.
c. Heterogeneous catalysts that are used for hydroprocessing of heavy
oils require pore structures with high macropore volume. This is
necessary to ensure good accessibility, partly due to the size of the
molecules and partly to combat deactivation by fouling.
d. Catalysts with strong acid sites cannot be considered for residue
hydroconversion, because the acid sites will lead to rapid coking and
deactivation of the catalyst. It is therefore preferable to combine
thermal cracking with hydrotreating, instead of employing
conventional bifunctional hydro-cracking catalysts.
e. The conversion per pass is limited due to the high H2 consumption
associated with aromatics saturation. Conversion is also limited by
the relatively low reaction rates. The main reactions that convert the
large molecules are thermal cracking, which are relatively slow at
temperatures of (420450)C. Even so, the H2 consumption of
residue hydroconversion is high due to the high heteroatom and
aromatics content of the feed.
In addition to those challenges already mentioned, there are two
fundamental difficulties with metal-catalysed hydroprocessing of bitu-
men. The first is related to the nature of the sulphur compounds, which
are mainly thiophenic. When thiophenic compounds have substituents
close to the sulphur, the sulphur is sterically protected. It is difficult
for such molecules to adsorb on the hydroprocessing catalyst in a con-
figuration that allows hydrodesulphurisation to take place. The second
difficulty is related to the hydrogenationdehydrogenation equilibrium.
At typical residue hydroprocessing temperatures (  400C), dehydroge-
nation is thermodynamically favoured unless very high H2 pressures
are employed [8].
5.6 FUTURE OF OILSANDS
Bitumen production from the Canadian oilsands is at present
approaching 2 % of global crude oil production. It is anticipated that
oilsands will play an even more significant role in the global oil supply
111
5.6 FUTURE OF OILSANDS
II. FOSSIL FUELS (ENERGY SOURCES)
in the coming decades. Despite this bullish prediction about the future
of oilsands, there are realities to be faced. Oilsands deposits are not
conventional crude oil deposits. It is more difficult to produce bitumen
from oilsands and it is more difficult to upgrade the bitumen; overcom-
ing these difficulties comes associated with increased environmental
penalties. In future the social licence to operate may depend on the
oilsands industryâs performance related to energy use (CO2 footprint)
and water management.
5.6.1 Energy Use in Oilsands Production and Bitumen
Upgrading
The recovery of bitumen from oilsands, as well as upgrading to
produce a transportable oil product is energy intensive. Expressed in
terms of an equivalent CO2 footprint, the energy use is of the order
of magnitude (500900) kg of CO2 for every m3 of oil [1]. The main
sources of energy use during oil production from oilsands are steam
generation for bitumen recovery, firing of bitumen upgrading processes
and H2 production.
A different way to look at this is to look at the thermal efficiency of
the overall process for the production of SCO. The high-level energy
balance of a process that involves oilsands mining, hot water extraction
and upgrading by coking and hydroprocessing is shown in Table 5.4
[26]. The indicated thermal efficiency of SCO production from oilsands
is 68%, about two-thirds of the calorific value of the input material.
This evaluates all products at combustion energy value and implies that
a product such as coke is also considered an energy source.
The thermal efficiency of SCO production from oilsands is in the
same range as that of production of liquids from coal by direct

liquefaction processes (Chapter 12). For example, it was reported that the
thermal efficiency of the Solvent-Refined Coal (SRC) processes was
(6473)%, the Exxon Donor Solvent (EDS) process was 63% and H-Coal
(6166)% [26]. The contribution of coal mining is not reflected in these
thermal efficiencies. The thermal efficiency of indirect liquefaction pro-
cesses is even lower, but the product quality is higher. Indirect liquefac-
tion using FischerTropsch synthesis in a typical present-day gas-to-
liquids facility has a CO2 footprint of 20003000 kg CO2 per m3 of oil
product [27].
It is therefore not surprising that oilsands production is often
discussed as a special feed-to-liquids (XTL) process, rather than a crude
oil process. In terms of thermal efficiency it falls between conventional
crude oil and direct coal liquefaction processes, bearing in mind that
thermal efficiency is not carbon efficiency.
It is important to point out that the CO2 footprint of any energy
conversion process is related to the amount of work that has to be
performed, as well as the effective H:C ratio of the raw material used in
the process. The work required is also related to the quality of the final
product. Feed substitution can have a tremendous impact. To put this
into perspective, by substituting natural gas with biomass, the CO2
footprint on a constant energy and efficiency basis doubles.
New ways will have to be found to reduce the energy use of oilsands
operations, bearing in mind that there is a thermodynamic limit to
the best thermal efficiency that can be attained. The nature of the feed
is such that improvements in energy use are likely to be incremental
and that the best attainable efficiency will be in the range (7080) %.
The lionâs share of opportunities for improvement in reducing the
energy use lies in developing new and better recovery processes. A sig-
nificant fraction of the energy use is related to applying energy to mobi-
lise and recover the bitumen.
5.6.2 Water Management in Oilsands Production
The first issue to consider is water use, which was discussed in
Section 5.2. The fresh water intake for mined oilsands is around (23)
m3 of water for every m3 of upgraded bitumen [1]. For in situ recovery
the fresh water intake is lower, around (0.50.8) m3 m23 of bitumen.
The actual volume of water used during processing is much higher,
with most of the water being recycled.
In any operation involving water recycle, the material balance
dictates how much fresh water must be added to replace water that
contains contaminants and that must be removed from the process.
There is a trade-off between energy use and water consumption. More
energy can be expended to reduce the fresh water intake by removing
113
5.6 FUTURE OF OILSANDS
II. FOSSIL FUELS (ENERGY SOURCES)
more contaminants from the process, or by accepting a higher fresh
water intake, less energy can be used for contaminant removal.
The water consumption rate, like thermal efficiency, is more in line with
that of XTL processes (Chapter 12). For a direct coal liquefaction process,
such as H-Coal process, the water consumption is of the order of 1 m3m23
of oil produced [28]. This excludes water use during coal mining, which
should be added for a direct comparison with oilsands production. For a
present day operating coal-to-liquids facility using FischerTropsch indi-
rect liquefaction, the water consumption is 8 m3 m23 of oil [27]. This can be
reduced to (23) m3m23 by employing closed-loop air-cooling.
Similar to CO2, the future of water use minimisation efforts is related
to the development of new and better recovery processes for bitumen
from oilsands. With current technology water is being used as the
vehicle to deliver energy to the reservoir. New technologies that gener-
ate this energy from within the reservoir, such as in situ combustion,
or that use solvents in combination or instead of steam, hold promise to
reduce water consumption from oilsands operations.
The second issue to consider in oilsands production is the persistence
of the tailing ponds that are associated with mined oilsands production.
This is a meaningful challenge to the future licence to operate. An
industry-wide effort is presently underway to deal with the tailing
ponds.
5.6.3 Improving Bitumen Upgrading Technology
The residue upgrading processes and technologies that are employed
for the conversion of oilsands-derived bitumen (Section 5.5) are mature
technologies. Thermal conversion processes have been in refinery oper-
ation for more than a century and residue hydroconversion is only
slightly younger. Still, it is necessary to find ways to improve technol-
ogy for bitumen upgrading. Some of the key technical challenges for
future improvements to bitumen upgrading are highlighted.
a. Increase liquid yield. Differently put, there is a need to moderate the
extent of hydrogen disproportionation in order to suppress coke and
light gas formation.
b. Reduce H2 consumption. The stoichiometric reality is that bitumen
with a H:C ratio of  1.5 is hydrogen deficient compared to
conventional crude oil. This implies that some H2 must be added, or
that some carbon must be rejected. In order to reduce the H2
consumption, H2 must be employed more selectively, carbon must
be rejected more selectively and/or heteroatoms must be rejected
with the least loss of hydrogen.
114
5. UNCONVENTIONAL OIL AND GAS: OILSANDS
II. FOSSIL FUELS (ENERGY SOURCES)
c. Conversion of asphaltenes to liquids. The asphaltene fraction in
bitumen is the most challenging fraction to upgrade due to its
physically associative nature, high heteroatom and metals content
and low H:C ratio. Current upgrading approaches lead to high
coke yields or high H2 consumption.
d. Field upgrading. The low fluidity of bitumen makes it desirable to
improve its fluidity as close as possible to the oilsands production
site. Ideally one would like to produce oil that meets pipeline
specifications. For low-cost field upgrading to be feasible, it is
necessary to upgrade the bitumen to meet this objective without
using H2.
