Abstract
This paper reports a study of PtSn/TiO2 catalysts reduced at two different temperatures (473 and 773 K) by infrared spectroscopy of CO
adsorbed at 298 K and XPS, as well as their behaviour in the vapour phase selective hydrogenation of crotonaldehyde at 333 K. Catalysts with
2 wt% Pt and different Pt:Sn atomic ratios were prepared by co-impregnation of a commercial TiO2 (P25, from Degussa) with aqueous solutions of
H2PtCl6 and SnCl22H2O. XPS results show that tin is in oxidized state when the catalysts are reduced at 473 K, whereas a proportion is in the
metallic state after reduction at 773 K. The amount of surface platinum decreases when the tin loading and the reduction temperature increase. The
presence of Pt-Sn alloy in the catalysts after reduction at high temperature has been assessed by in situ IR spectroscopy of adsorbed CO, although a
proportion of platinum remains in a non-alloyed state. The catalytic activity in the vapour-phase hydrogenation of crotonaldehyde increases after
high temperature reduction, and the same behaviour is obtained with selectivity towards the hydrogenation of the carbonyl bond to yield the
unsaturated alcohol, the best selectivity being obtained for the catalyst with the lowest Pt/Sn ratio.

1. Introduction
Bimetallic Pt-Sn catalysts, mainly supported on alumina, are
widely used in many catalytic processes in petrochemical
(reforming, hydrogenation and dehydrogenation of light
alkanes) and ﬁne chemical industries (selective hydrogena-
tions), yielding a better performance, in terms of stability and
activity, than the monometallic Pt/Al2O3 [1,2].
In
the
ﬁeld
of
ﬁne
chemicals,
the
preparation
of
unsaturated alcohols by the selective hydrogenation of the
corresponding a,b-unsaturated aldehydes has a great indus-
trial importance in the synthesis of many products [3,4]. This
reaction constitutes a challenging task, since the hydrogena-
tion of the C C bond is thermodynamically favoured over the
hydrogenation of the carbonyl bond, and with traditional
hydrogenation catalysts the selectivity towards the unsatu-
rated alcohol is usually low. An improvement in activity and
selectivity towards the unsaturated alcohol has been found
with the use of bimetallic Pt-Sn catalysts [5]. The promoter
effect of tin is attributed to oxidized tin species which, acting
as a Lewis acid, interacts with the oxygen atom of the
carbonyl bond (basic group), thus weakening the C O bond
and favouring its hydrogenation. However, metallic tin has
been also detected by XPS in these systems [6,7]. This
metallic tin would be able to form Pt-Sn alloy phases, and the
dilution of platinum by tin would destroy the platinum
ensembles, lowering the number of sites that strongly interact
with hydrogen and chemisorb the a,b-unsaturated aldehyde
through the oleﬁnic bond, thus hindering the C C hydro-
genation reaction rate.
Another way to improve the selectivity towards the
unsaturated alcohol is the use of a support that can modify
the catalytic properties of the dispersed metal or bimetallic
system. Tauster et al. [8,9] found that, when partially reducible

oxides such as TiO2 are used as support, they can modify the
chemisorption behaviour of hydrogen and carbon monoxide on
metals from groups 8, 9 and 10 after reduction at high
temperature (about 773 K). The term strong metal–support
interaction (SMSI) was introduced to label this effect. Vannice
found the promoter effect of TiO2 on metals from group 8 after
reduction at 773 K for several reactions [10,11]. A model to
explain this behaviour has been proposed, involving the
formation of special sites at the interface between the metal and
the support. These sites consist of partially reduced TiOx
species (or oxygen vacancies) that coordinate the oxygen atom
of the C O to increase the selectivity towards the hydrogena-
tion of the carbonyl bond [10–12].
In the work presented here, the promoting effect of tin has
been studied, in both metallic and oxidized states, in a series of
PtSn/TiO2 catalysts with different Pt:Sn atomic ratio, for the
selective hydrogenation of crotonaldehyde. The inﬂuence of the
strong metal–support interaction effect on this reaction is also
studied by using low (473 K) and high (773 K) reduction
temperature treatments on the catalysts. The catalysts have
been characterized, after reduction at both temperatures, by X-
ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and in situ infrared
spectroscopy of adsorbed CO, this allowing a comprehensive
description of the surface composition and the available
adsorption sites.
2. Experimental
Degussa P25 (60% anatase, 40% rutile) with a surface area
of 50 m2 g1 (N2, 77 K, BET method) was used as a support,
which was previously calcined in air at 773 K for 5 h. The PtSn/
TiO2 catalysts were prepared by a co-impregnation method,
with an aqueous solution of H2PtCl66H2O (Johnson Matthey)
of an appropriate concentration to achieve a Pt content of
2 wt%, and SnCl22H2O (Aldrich). Catalysts with nominal
Pt:Sn atomic ratios of 1:2, 2:1, 3:1, and 4:1 were prepared. The
slurry was stirred for 12 h and then the excess solvent was
removed by heating at 363 K under vacuum in a rotary
evaporator. Finally, the catalysts were dried at 383 K for 24 h
and calcined in synthetic air at 673 K for 4 h.
XPS spectra were acquired with a VG-Microtech Multilab
3000 spectrometer equipped with a hemispherical electron
analyzer
and
a
Mg
Ka
300 W
(hn = 1253.6 eV,
1 eV = 1.6302  1019 J) 300 W X-ray source. The powder
samples were pressed into small Inox cylinders and then
mounted on a sample rod placed in a pre-treatment chamber and
reduced in H2 for 1 h at 473 and 773 K before being transferred
to the analysis chamber. Before recording the spectra, the
sample was maintained in the analysis chamber until a residual
pressure of 5  109 mbar was reached. The spectra were
collected at a pass energy of 50 eV. The intensities were
estimated by calculating the integral of each peak, after
subtraction of the S-shaped background, and by ﬁtting the
experimental curve to a combination of Lorentzian (30%) and
Gaussian (70%) lines. Binding energies were referenced to the
Ti 2p3/2 line in TiO2 at 458.5 eV, which provide values with an
accuracy of 0.2 eV. The surface Pt/Ti and Pt/Sn ratios were
estimated from the integrated intensities, after correction for
atomic sensitivity factors [13].
In situ IR experiments were carried out using a quartz cell
ﬁtted with CaF2 windows and an external furnace. Catalyst
samples were prepared as 16 mm diameter self-supporting
disks by pressing 70 mg of loose powder between polished steel
dies at 15 MN m2. Prior to any measurements, samples were
reduced in situ under a hydrogen ﬂow (50 cm3 min1) at 473 or
773 K for 1 h. After reduction, samples were out-gassed at the
reduction temperature for 15 min, to a ﬁnal pressure of
105 Torr, before cooling to ambient temperature. Pulses of
CO were introduced at 298 K using calibrated volumes and an
Edward active strain gauge to measure the pressure of the pulse.
IR spectra were recorded at 4 cm1 resolution and averaging 25
scans per spectrum.
The vapour-phase hydrogenation of crotonaldehyde (2-
butenal) was tested in a micro-reactor at atmospheric pressure
and differential conditions. The catalysts (between 0.01 and
0.03 g) were reduced in situ at 473 or 773 K under ﬂowing H2
(50 cm3 min1) for 1 h and then cooled under H2 to the reaction
temperature (333 K). The hydrogenation reaction was carried
out using a reaction mixture (total ﬂow: 50 cm3 min1; H2/
aldehyde ratio of 26) of H2 and crotonaldehyde (Fluka,
>99.5%), which was prepared by passing H2 through a
thermostated saturator (293 K) containing crotonaldehyde. The
concentration of reactants and products was determined by
online GC with a Carbowax 20 M 58/90 semicapillary column.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. XPS characterization
The binding energies of the Pt 4f7/2 and Sn 3d3/2 levels for
the catalysts, both freshly prepared (vacuum treatment at room
temperature) and reduced in situ at 473 and 773 K for 1 h, are
reported in Table 1. In some cases two values are given arising
from a deconvolution of the main peak into two contributions,
with the corresponding contribution to the overall signal in
brackets. The surface Pt/Ti atomic ratios are also presented
(which can be used as an estimation of the platinum dispersion
on the titania support), as well as the surface Pt/Sn atomic
ratios. Additionally, the relative amounts of oxidized tin species
(Snox/Sntotal), estimated from the integral of XPS peaks, is also
shown.
The Pt 4f spectra for the unreduced and reduced catalysts are
compared in Fig. 1. For all catalysts, the spectra can be
deconvoluted into two peaks, the one at lower binding energy
corresponding to Pt 4f7/2 level and the second one, at higher
binding energies, to the Pt 4f5/2 level. For all catalysts, the peaks
are quite similar, and for the shake of brevity, only the Pt 4f
spectra for the catalyst with atomic ratio Pt:Sn = 1:2 is
discussed and shown. For the unreduced catalyst, the peak
corresponding to the Pt 4f7/2 level is centered at 72.5 eV, and it
is assigned to oxidized platinum species. The exact assignation
of this peak is not easy, because the binding energy of core
electrons is not only affected by the metal oxidation state but
also by the ligand atoms to which they are coordinated. The

binding energy of the Pt 4f7/2 level for Pt(IV) coordinated to six
chlorine atoms (as in the platinum precursor used for the
preparation of the catalysts) is reported to be about 75.3 eV (for
K2PtCl6), but it increases to 74.8 eV for PtO2 and further to
74.2 eV for Pt(OH)4. Additionally, the binding energies of the
Pt 4 f7/2 level for PtCl2 is reported to be about 73.4 eV, whereas
that for Pt(OH)2 is about 72.4 eV [13]. Therefore, the XPS of
the unreduced catalyst would suggest that a certain level of
dechlorination of the platinum precursor has taken place. After
the reduction treatments (at 473 and 773 K), a single peak
appears for the level, which is centered at 71.4 and 71.1 eV for
the catalyst reduced at 473 and 773 K, respectively. These
binding energies are characteristic of platinum in metallic state.
The binding energy is lower when the sample is reduced at
773 K, and this can be attributed to several factors, such as a
decrease in the chloride levels on the surface or even metal
sintering.
The Sn 3d5/2 spectra for the unreduced and reduced catalysts
are plotted in Fig. 2. The spectra indicate a shift of the binding
energy towards

temperature, thus indicating the reduction of oxidized tin
species. For the unreduced catalyst and the one reduced at
473 K, only one band is observed which is centered between
486.2 and 487 eV, and it is assigned to oxidized tin species.
After reduction at 773 K, a second band appeared at lower
binding energy (around 485 eV), which is characteristic of
metallic tin. Therefore, the surface composition of the
bimetallic catalysts reduced at 473 and at 773 K is different.
Whereas platinum is in metallic state after both reduction
treatments, tin is in oxidized state when catalysts are reduced at
473 K, and in both oxidized and metallic states after reduction
at 773 K. The presence of metallic tin in the catalysts reduced at
773 K opens up the possibility for the existence of Pt-Sn alloy
phases after this treatment, although this cannot be readily
assessed by XPS.
Discrimination between Sn(II) and Sn(IV) species with XPS
is difﬁcult. Therefore, the aim of the deconvolution procedure
was to separate the contributions of oxidized and metallic tin
species. The ratio between the amount of oxidized tin species
and the total amount of tin (Snox/Sntotal) depends on the Pt:Sn
ratio. Table 1 shows that the relative amount of Snox decreases
when the Pt:Sn ratio increases. That is it decreases when the
total amount of tin decreases.
When the catalysts are reduced at 473 K, the Pt/Ti atomic
ratio decreases as the amount of tin increases. This would be
consistent with coverage of the platinum particles by oxidized
tin species. The same effect is observed after the reduction
treatment at 773 K. In the latter case, this might arise due to: (i)
dilution of the platinum by metallic tin, upon the formation of
Pt:Sn bimetallic phases, and (ii) formation of partially reduced
titanium oxide, TiO2x, that can migrate onto the surface of the
metallic particles leading to partial decoration.
Finally, the Pt/Sn atomic ratio decreases when the amount of
tin loading increases, and when the catalysts are reduced at
773 K, which can be also attributed to the effects previously
discussed. This drop in the Pt/Sn atomic ratio is lower when the
amount of tin loaded increases. On the other hand, the Pt:Sn
surface atomic ratio is always lower than in the bulk, which
indicates a signiﬁcant surface enrichment with tin species.
3.2. Infrared spectroscopy
Fig. 3 shows the FTIR spectra of CO adsorbed on different
PtSn/TiO2 catalysts after reduction at 473 K. For the shake of
clarity, only spectra for catalysts with atomic ratio Pt:Sn = 4:1,
2:1 and 1:2 have been plotted. In all cases, catalysts reduced at
473 K have been exposed, at 298 K, to increasing CO doses until
reaching 50 Torr, followed by evacuation in high vacuum for 1 h
at 298 K. All spectra exhibit bands in the 2150–2000 cm1
region, that are assigned to CO linearly adsorbed on the different
metallic sites. The IR spectrum obtained after introduction of a
CO dose of less than 0.1 Torrcontains only a broad band centered
at 2072 cm1, as well as a low frequency shoulder at 2040 cm1.
An increase in the CO pressure produced a blue shift (2080–
2084 cm1), as well as an increase in the intensity of the bands.
The bands are now composed of two or more contributions, with
the relative intensity of the highest frequency component being
enhanced to a greater extent by an increase in the CO pressure. A
band of low intensity at 1890 cm1 is also observed, which
corresponds to bridge-bonded CO. A further band at 2188 cm1
assigned to CO adsorbed on the support [14], disappeared after
evacuation at 298 K.
The shape of the peaks is similar in all the spectra, but the
intensity in the spectral region for CO linearly adsorbed,
decreases with the Pt:Sn atomic ratio. This can be explained by
a loss of surface platinum when the amount of tin loaded
increases, consistent with XPS results.
When the catalysts are reduced at 773 K (Fig. 4), the bands
corresponding to linearly adsorbed CO are detected at lower
wavenumbers. In this case, a maximum in intensity at
2062 cm1 appears at low coverage and, as in the previous
spectra, it is followed by a shoulder at 2040 cm1. The
maximum is blue-shifted (around 2070–2080 cm1) at high CO
coverage.

In the region of bridging carbonyls, there is only one small
band (at 1850 cm1) at high coverage in the catalyst with Pt:Sn
atomic ratio of 4:1. There are also two bands that appear at high
coverage, at 2188 and 2207 cm1, which correspond to CO
adsorbed
in
non-reduced
and
partially
reduced
titania,
respectively. These bands disappear after evacuation under
vacuum at 298 K.
From a comparison of these results with those obtained with
the monometallic catalyst, Pt/TiO2 [15], it can be concluded that
the band corresponding to linearly adsorbed CO is present at
lower wavenumbers in the presence of Sn. Previous IR studies of
CO adsorption on PtSn catalysts, have attributed this to
geometric [16,17], electronic [18–20], or a sum of both effects.
In this work, results can be explained simply by a geometric
effect, although electronic effects cannot be ruled out, given that
the addition of tin could make Pt either electron deﬁcient via
interaction with Sn(II) ions, obtaining a shift to higher
wavenumbers, or electron rich via formation of a solid solution
of Sn in Pt, yielding in this case a negative (red) shift [18].
There is no displacement of the main IR bands to higher
wavenumbers in the CO spectra of catalysts reduced at 473 K.
Bands can be assigned from single crystal studies, considering
coordination numbers and the number of neighbouring sites
likely
to
result
in
coupling
interactions
[21–23].
The
predominant band can be attributed to CO linearly adsorbed
on terrace sites with limited extension or where the metal atoms
are present in more open arrangements such as in (1 0 0) facets.
Low frequency components also arise due to the deposition of
tin oxide on the surface of the particles of platinum. This would
reduce the number of dipolar coupling interactions experienced
by each Pt-carbonyl, reducing the extent to which band
intensity is transferred from low to high to wavenumber
components. The band at 1890 cm1 is associated to CO
adsorbed in a two-fold-bridging mode on the close packed
terrace sites [24,25]. There is a loss of intensity when compared
with previous studies on monometallic Pt/TiO2 [15] catalysts,
which is consistent with the idea of tin oxide on the surface of
platinum, due to changes in the local site geometry of the
remaining exposed adsorption sites.
Reduction at 773 K produces a drastic decrease in IR band
intensity, indicating a low CO uptake which correlates with the
atomic Pt/Ti ratio obtained by XPS. This is not due to sintering
of platinum particles, as larger particles would yield a higher
proportion of CO adsorbed on close packed terrace sites such as
(1 1 1) patches, resulting in a band at higher frequency. This
loss in adsorption capacity can be associated with the migration
of partially reduced titania particles to the platinum surface
(SMSI effect) [14].
On the other hand, the band of CO linearly adsorbed does not
shift to higher wavenumbers when the coverage is increased.
This is consistent with expectations for a geometric effect due
to the formation of Pt-Sn alloy. The presence of metallic Sn
would dilute the concentration of surface Pt atoms and,
therefore, would reduce the number of dipolar coupling
interactions experienced by each Pt-carbonyl [16,26]. Although
a blue shift in the band position is observed at high coverage, it
reﬂects that not all the surface platinum is present in the Pt-Sn
alloy phase(s). On comparing with the catalyst reduced at
473 K, there is a red shift of the band position, which is
explained by the existence of a close interaction between Pt and
Sn leading to an enhanced electron density on Pt [18,20,27].
Finally, the band corresponding to bridge-bonded CO was
practically absent in all the catalysts reduced at 773 K. This can
be explained by two effects: (i) the migration of partially
reduced titania species to the surface of the metallic particles
and (ii) the formation of Pt-Sn alloy.
3.3. Crotonaldehyde hydrogenation
Fig. 5a shows the evolution of catalytic activity (mmoles of
crotonaldehyde transformed per second per gram of platinum)
as a function of time on stream at 333 K for the catalysts
reduced at 473 K. The initial data were taken when the carbon
balance was achieved. Prior to this, reactant and products were
adsorbed by the catalysts and no reliable data could be
obtained.
After an initial period of deactivation in the ﬁrst 50 min of
reaction, the activity in all the catalysts remained practically
stable with time on stream. The catalyst with an atomic ratio
Pt:Sn = 3:1 has the highest activity (500 mmol s1 g Pt1),
followed
by
the
4:1,
2:1
and
1:2
(435,
105
and
20 mmol s1 g Pt1, respectively). This suggests that tin has

39
a promoting effect in the activity until reaching an optimum
content and, after that, higher amounts of Sn has a detrimental
effect.
When the catalysts are reduced at 773 K, the trend of the
activity with the time on stream is quite similar (Fig. 7a), with a
high activity during the ﬁrst stages of the reaction, catalyst
deactivation and a nearly stable activity after about 150 min on
stream. It can be clearly seen that the catalytic activity is higher
after reduction at high temperature (773 K). For a monometallic
Pt/TiO2, the opposite behaviour was found [15].
Taking into account XPS and FTIR results, there is a loss of
platinum atoms in the catalyst surface when the catalysts are
reduced at high temperature. This can be assigned to the
induction of the SMSI effect, which is characterized by the
decoration of the metal particles by patches of partially reduced
titania species, and also a diluting effect due to the formation of
Pt-Sn alloy phases. It can be asserted that the remaining
platinum atoms are much more active thanks to the interfacial
sites created after the reduction step at high temperature and
due to alloy formation.
In the hydrogenation of crotonaldehyde, a molecule
containing
two
conjugated
double
bonds,
two
primary
hydrogenation
routes
can
take
place
(Fig.
6):
(i)
the
hydrogenation of the oleﬁnic C C bond to yield butanal and
(ii) the hydrogenation of the C O bond to yield crotyl alcohol.
These compounds can be further hydrogenated to produce
butanol and butane, and crotyl alcohol can also isomerise to
butanal. Moreover, decarbonylation could also take place,
yielding light hydrocarbons (C1–3). The extend of the secondary
reactions depends on the total conversion; therefore, the
selectivity towards crotyl alcohol usually decreases when the
conversion increases [6,7,28].
In this study, the only reaction products detected were
butanal, crotyl alcohol and a small amount of butane and
butanol. Fig. 5b compares the selectivity towards crotyl alcohol
as a function of time on stream for the PtSn/TiO2 catalysts
reduced at 473 K. The tendency is quite similar for the catalysts
with Pt:Sn atomic ratio of 4:1, 3:1 and 2:1. There is an increase
in selectivity during the ﬁrst minutes of reaction, reaching a
nearly constant value. The highest selectivity (44%) is achieved
by the catalyst with the atomic ratio Pt:Sn = 2:1, followed by
4:1 and 3:1 (36 and 28%, respectively). Comparing these results
with previous studies on Pt/TiO2 monometallic catalysts [15], it
can be concluded that the addition of tin stabilize the selectivity
towards crotyl alcohol, although there is no direct relationship
between the selectivity and the amount of tin loading.
On the other hand, the selectivity towards crotyl alcohol for
the catalyst with an atomic ratio Pt:Sn = 1:2 increases quickly
in the ﬁrst minutes on stream, reaching a maximum of 45%, and
then decreases until reaching a value of 25% at the end of the
reaction (time on stream = 300 min). In this case, the addition
of high levels of tin has a negative effect on the selectivity.
Furthermore, it decreases with the time on stream after ﬁrst
100 min.
The evolution of the selectivity towards crotyl alcohol as a
function of time on stream when the catalysts are reduced at
high temperature (773 K) is quite similar (Fig. 7b). It remains
practically constant with time on stream. For all catalysts, the
selectivity towards crotyl alcohol was increased as compared to
that obtained with catalysts reduced at low temperature
(473 K), except for the catalyst with atomic ratio Pt:Sn = 1:2,
for which the selectivity practically does not change. The
increase in selectivity towards crotyl alcohol with the reduction
temperature can be explained as the sum of two effects. On one
hand, the decoration of the metal particles by partially reduced
titania, with the formation of new sites at the metal–partially
reduced titania support interface that can activate the carbonyl
bond favouring its hydrogenation. On the other hand, the
number of sites which are able to hydrogenate the C C bond
decreases with tin addition due to a dilution of platinum by tin
in the Pt-Sn alloy phases formed. Therefore, the amount of sites
that strongly interact with hydrogen and chemisorb crotonal-
dehyde through the oleﬁnic bond would decrease, this reducing
the C C bond hydrogenation reaction rate [7].
When the catalysts are reduced at 773 K there is an inverse
relationship between catalytic activity and selectivity towards

has the highest activity and a low tin content (Pt:Sn = 3:1),
whereas the sample with the highest selectivity (60%) has the
lowest activity and the highest tin content (Pt:Sn = 1:2). Taking
into account previous studies with a Pt/TiO2 monometallic
catalyst [15], bimetallic catalysts have a higher activity and
selectivity towards crotyl alcohol, this proving the important
role of the tin is this system. The formation of Pt-Sn alloy
phases to a greater extent in the catalysts with the highest
amount of tin could explain the high selectivity obtained, this
correlating with a decrease in the activity due to the dilution of
the platinum surface atoms by the formation of Pt-Sn alloy. The
possibility of an interaction between the support and different
tin species that could affect the platinum performance could be
also taken into account.
The overall conversion in all cases was kept into a range
from 2 to 10%. Nevertheless, there are no important changes in
the selectivity towards crotyl alcohol with conversion.
4. Conclusions
In this work, the catalytic behaviour of bimetallic PtSn/TiO2
catalysts with different Pt:Sn atomic ratio is compared, after
reduction at low (473 K) and high (773 K) temperature, for the
vapour phase selective hydrogenation of crotonaldehyde. XPS
results show that tin is in oxidized state when the samples are
unreduced and reduced in situ at 473 K, whereas at high
reduction temperature, a given amount of tin is in metallic state.
The amount of surface platinum decreases when the samples
are reduced at high temperature and when the amount of tin
loaded increases, by in situ IR spectroscopy the presence of Pt-
Sn alloy after reduction at high temperature is assessed,
although platinum without forming Pt-Sn alloy is still
remaining on the surface. The effect of reduction at high
temperature is a dramatic increase in catalytic activity for
crotonaldehyde hydrogenation, and, in most cases, an increase
in the selectivity towards crotyl alcohol. Catalyst with the
highest amount on tin (Pt:Sn = 1:2 atomic ratio) reduced at
773 K has shown the best performance in the selectivity
towards crotyl alcohol. The combined effects of the decoration
of metallic particles by partially reduced titania and PtSn alloy
formation are suggested as being the main factors of this
behaviour.
