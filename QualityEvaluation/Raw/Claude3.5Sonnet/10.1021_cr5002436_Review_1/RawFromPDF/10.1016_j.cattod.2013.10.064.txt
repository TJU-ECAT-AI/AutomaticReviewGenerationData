 Introduction
The
 catalytic
 dehydrogenation
 of
 light
 alkanes
 such
 as
 propane
and
 butane
 is
 of
 great
 interest
 due
 to
 growing
 demands
 of
 alkenes
as
 an
 important
 raw
 chemical
 intermediate
 to
 produce
 rubber,
 plas-
tics
 and
 many
 other
 products
 [1,2].
 The
 conventional
 way
 of
 light
alkenes
 in
 the
 petrochemical
 industry
 is
 steam
 cracking
 of
 alkanes,
naphtha,
 and
 gas
 oil.
 The
 steam
 cracking
 is
 typically
 carried
 out
above
 1000
 K.
 Thus,
 this
 reaction
 is
 energetically-unfavorable
 and
shows
 low
 selectivity
 to
 alkenes.
 For
 example,
 in
 the
 case
 of
 steam
cracking
 of
 naphtha,
 the
 yields
 of
 ethane
 and
 propylene
 are
 ca.
30
 and
 20%,
 with
 substantial
 amounts
 of
 by-products
 including
methane
 and
 coke.

of
 light
 alkanes
 provides
 an
 alternative
 for
 producing
 light
 alkenes
as
 well
 as
 hydrogen.
Supported
 platinum-tin
 alloy
 catalysts
 have
 been
 widely
 stud-
ied
 in
 catalytic
 dehydrogenation
 of
 propane
 (DHP)
 [3–6].
 The
addition
 of
 Sn
 to
 Pt/support
 catalyst
 system
 has
 been
 found
 to
 favor
selective
 lower
 alkane
 dehydrogenation,
 suppress
 the
 coke
 forma-
tion
 and
 increase
 the
 lifetime
 of
 the
 catalyst.
 These
 positive
 effects
of
 Sn
 on
 the
 catalytic
 performance
 of
 supported
 Pt
 catalysts
 have
been
 interpreted
 from
 both
 a
 geometrical
 (ensemble)
 and
 an
 elec-
tronic
 point
 of
 view
 [3–12].
 Despite
 extensive
 studies,
 the
 role
 of
 Sn
in
 a
 Pt–Sn
 catalyst
 remains
 elusive
 and
 the
 accurate
 nature
 of
 Pt–Sn
system
 is
 complicated
 for
 many
 years.
 It
 has
 been
 well
 known
 that
the
 properties
 of
 Pt–Sn
 alloy
 catalyst
 have
 been
 found
 to
 depend
 on
the
 several
 factors
 such
 as
 support,
 metallic
 precursor,
 and
 prepa-
ration
 procedure
 [8,13,14].
 Moreover,
 the
 active
 alloy
 phases
 often
collapse
 into
 each
 metal
 oxide
 under
 ambient
 oxygen,
 resulting
 in
deactivation
 of
 catalyst.
 Uemura
 et
 al.
 reported
 the
 reductive
 for-
mation
 and
 oxidative
 phase
 separation
 of
 Pt3Sn
 alloy
 nanoparticle
in
 the
 reduction
 and
 oxidation
 processes
 by
 the
 in
 situ
 time
 resolved
XAFS
 techniques
 [15,16].
 This
 indicates
 that
 the
 stability
 of
 sup-
ported
 alloy
 catalyst
 is
 affected
 by
 the
 reaction
 and
 regeneration
conditions
 [6,15,16].
 As
 a
 consequence,
 there
 has
 been
 considerable
interest
 in
 developing
 means
 to
 control
 the
 interactions

 to

 Experimental
2.1.
 Preparation
A
 silica
 (JRC-SIO-9,
 334
 m2 g−1)
 was
 used
 as
 support
 to
 prepare
Pt
 and
 Pt–Sn
 catalysts.
 Prior
 to
 impregnation,
 the
 SiO2 support
 was
treated
 at
 773
 K
 for
 3
 h
 in
 air.
 Silica-supported
 Pt
 catalyst
 (Pt/SiO2)
was
 prepared
 by
 impregnation
 of
 SiO2 with
 the
 adequate
 volume
of
 an
 aqueous
 solution
 of
 H2PtCl6·6H2O
 (Wako,
 99.9%),
 followed
 by
the
 stirring
 at
 353
 K
 for
 3
 h
 and
 dried
 at
 353
 K
 for
 20
 h.
 A
 bimetal-
lic
 Pt–Sn/SiO2 was
 prepared
 by
 sequential
 impregnation
 method.
The
 SiO2 support
 was
 ﬁrstly
 impregnated
 with
 an
 aqueous
 solu-
tion
 of
 H2PtCl6·6H2O,
 and
 then
 stirred
 at
 353
 K
 for
 3
 h,
 and
 dried
at
 353
 K
 for
 20
 h.
 Then
 the
 precipitate
 was
 added
 to
 an
 acetone
solution
 of
 SnCl2·2H2O
 (Wako,
 97%),
 stirred
 at
 353
 K
 for
 3
 h
 and
dried
 at
 353
 K
 for
 20
 h
 to
 yield
 the
 catalyst
 precursor.
 The
 Pt
 con-
tent
 was
 3
 wt%.
 The
 molar
 ration
 of
 Pt
 to
 Sn
 was
 1.0.
 Prior
 to
 the
reaction,
 the
 catalyst
 precursor
 was
 reduced
 by
 following
 three
methods
 (Scheme
 1):
 (1)
 Direct
 reduction
 (DR)
 The
 catalyst
 pre-
cursor
 was
 in
 situ
 reduced
 in
 20
 vol%
 H2 diluted
 with
 N2 (total
 ﬂow
rate
 50
 ml
 min−1)
 at
 1073
 K
 for
 1
 h,
 and
 then
 cooled
 to
 773
 K
 in
N2 (100
 ml
 min−1).
 (2)
 Decomposition
 in
 inert
 gas
 (DI) The
 cata-
lyst
 precursor
 was
 treated
 with
 N2 (total
 ﬂow
 rate
 50
 ml
 min−1)
 at
1073
 K
 for
 1
 h,
 and
 then
 cooled
 to
 773
 K
 in
 N2 (100
 ml
 min−1).
 (3)
Calcination-reduction
 (CR)
 The
 catalyst
 precursor
 was
 ﬁrstly
 cal-
cined
 in
 20
 vol%
 O2 diluted
 with
 N2 (total
 ﬂow
 rate
 50
 ml
 min−1)
 at
773
 K
 for
 1
 h,
 and
 then
 reduced
 in
 20
 vol%
 H2 diluted
 with
 N2 (total
ﬂow
 rate
 50
 ml
 min−1)
 at
 1073
 K
 for
 1
 h.
 Finally,
 the
 catalyst
 was
cooled
 to
 773
 K
 in
 N2 (100
 ml
 min−1).
2.2.
 Propane
 dehydrogenation
Propane
 dehydrogenation
 was
 carried
 out
 by
 using
 a
 quartz
reactor
 at
 atmospheric
 pressure
 with
 C3H8/N2 (20/80)
 mixed
 gas
at
 773
 K.
 Total
 ﬂow
 rate
 was
 100
 ml
 min−1.
 The
 catalyst
 precursor
(50
 mg)
 was
 placed
 between
 glass-wool.
 The
 gas
 composition
 was
analyzed
 with
 an
 on-line
 gas
 chromatographs
 (Shimadzu
 GC-8A,
Japan)
 equipped
 with
 a
 TCD
 (Molecular
 Sives-5A
 column)
 and
 a
methanizer
 FID
 (Porapak-Q
 column)
 detectors.
2.3.
 Characterization
The
 Brunauer–Emmett–Teller
 (BET)
 speciﬁc
 surface
 area
 was
estimated
 from
 N2 isotherm
 at
 77
 K.
 The
 N2 adsorption
 isotherm
measurements
 were
 carried
 out
 by
 using
 a
 BELSORP
 28SA
 (BEL
Japan,
 Osaka,
 Japan)
 at
 77
 K.
 Prior
 to
 the
 measurement,
 each
 sample
was
 evacuated
 at
 573
 K
 for
 3
 h.
 The
 amount
 of
 adsorbed
 CO
 was
determined
 by
 CO
 pulse
 method
 with
 an
 Okura
 BP-2
 instrument
(Okura
 Riken,
 Japan)
 interfaced
 with
 a
 TCD.
 X-ray

 Propane
 dehydrogenation
Fig.
 1
 shows
 the
 time
 course
 of
 propane
 conversion
 on
 Pt/SiO2
and
 Pt–Sn/SiO2 catalysts.
 The
 propane
 conversion
 on
 Pt/SiO2 (DR)
was
 quite
 low
 (ca.
 5%)
 and
 sharply
 declined,
 indicating
 that
monometallic
 Pt
 catalyst
 showed
 a
 low
 activity
 and
 stability.
 The
Pt–Sn/SiO2 (DR)
 catalyst
 showed
 the
 highest
 activity
 and
 selec-
tivity
 toward
 propylene
 (>99%).
 A
 trace
 amount
 of
 methane
 and
ethane
 were
 detected
 as
 by-products.
 Up
 to
 now,
 many
 researchers
have
 reported
 the
 positive
 effect
 of
 Sn
 on
 the
 catalytic
 property
 of
supported
 Pt
 catalyst
 for
 dehydrogenation
 of
 propane
 [6,12,18,19],
butane
 [7,20],
 isobutane
 [4,21],
 and
 hexane
 [8].
 Generally,
 the
 selec-
tivity
 to
 alkene
 improved
 by
 the
 addition
 of
 Sn
 because
 of
 the
suppression
 of
 hydrogeolysis
 property,
 but
 the
 activity
 decreased.
In
 contrast,
 in
 the
 case
 of
 the
 Pt–Sn/SiO2 (DR)
 catalyst,
 the
 addi-
tion
 of
 Sn
 improved
 not
 only
 the
 catalytic
 performance
 (activity
and
 selectivity
 to
 propylene)
 but
 also
 the
 stability.
 On
 the
 other
hand,
 the
 Pt–Sn/SiO2 (CR)
 catalyst
 showed
 a
 low
 activity
 and
 the
selectivity
 to
 propylene
 on
 Pt–Sn/SiO2 (CR)
 was
 slightly
 lower
 (ca.
95%)
 than
 Pt–Sn/SiO2 (DR),
 regardless
 of
 the
 coexistence
 of
 Sn
 with
Pt.
 The
 conversion
 of
 propane
 on
 Pt–Sn/SiO2 (DI)
 was
 higher
 than
Pt–Sn/SiO2 (CR),
 but
 lower
 than
 Pt–Sn/SiO2 (DR).
 The
 selectivity
 to
propylene
 on
 Pt–Sn/SiO2 (DI)
 was
 about
 99%.
 The
 activity
 gradually
decreased
 with
 time
 on
 stream.

 Physical
 and
 chemical
 properties
 of
 Pt/SiO2 and
 Pt–Sn/SiO2
Table
 1
 summarizes
 the
 BET
 speciﬁc
 surface
 area
 and
 the
 amount
of
 adsorbed
 CO.
 Fig.
 2
 shows
 TEM
 images
 of
 Pt/SiO2 and
 Pt–Sn/SiO2,
and
 the
 particle
 size
 histograms
 of
 black
 spot
 observed
 in
 TEM
images.
 Black
 spots
 were
 assigned
 to
 Pt
 or
 Pt–Sn
 alloy
 particle
 on
SiO2.
 The
 BET
 surface
 area
 of
 Pt/SiO2 (DR)
 was
 slightly
 larger
 than
bare
 SiO2.
 On
 the
 Pt/SiO2 (DR),
 small
 Pt
 particles
 whose
 mean
 par-
ticle
 size
 was
 about
 2.0
 nm
 were
 observed.
 When
 Sn
 was
 added
into
 monometallic
 Pt
 catalyst
 system,
 the
 BET
 surface
 area
 slightly
decreased
 compared
 with
 that
 of
 Pt/SiO2 (DR).
 The
 particle
 size
 on
Pt–Sn/SiO2 catalysts
 (2.2–3.3
 nm)
 was
 slightly
 larger
 than
 that
 on
Pt/SiO2 catalyst
 regardless
 of
 the
 reduction
 method.
 However,
 the
amount
 of
 adsorbed
 CO
 remarkably
 decreased
 by
 the
 addition
 of
 Sn.
These
 results
 suggest
 the
 formation
 of
 Pt–Sn
 alloy
 and/or
 the
 depo-
sition
 of
 Sn
 species
 on
 the
 surface
 of
 Pt
 metal
 particle.
 Meriaudeau
et
 al.
 reported
 that
 the
 addition
 of
 Sn
 to
 Pt
 reduced
 the
 strength
 of
Pt
 CO
 bond
 by
 the
 preferential
 blocking
 of
 higher
 binding
 sites
 of
Pt
 by
 Sn
 [19].
 The
 reduction
 of
 strength
 of
 Pt
 CO
 bond
 was
 inter-
preted
 as
 this
 geometric
 effect.
 Recently,
 Wang
 et
 al.
 synthesized
Pt–Sn
 intermetallic,
 core/shell,
 and
 alloy
 nanoparticles
 by
 using
 col-
loidal
 technique,
 and
 investigated
 the
 CO
 adsorption
 properties
 of
prepared
 Pt–Sn
 compounds
 [22].
 The
 intensity
 of
 linearly
 adsorbed
CO
 clearly
 decreased
 with
 increasing
 the
 surface
 Sn/Pt
 ratio,
 that
 is,
the
 increasing
 of
 Sn
 surface
 coverage.
 On
 the
 other
 hand,
 Liu
 et
 al.
reported
 that
 the
 PtSn@Pt
 core–shell
 nanoparticle
 electrocatalysts
prepared
 by
 potential
 cycling
 of
 PtSn
 intermetallic
 nanoparticles
 in
CO-saturated
 H2SO4 solutions
 exhibited
 a
 substantially
 higher
 CO-
tolerance
 property
 than
 Pt,
 PtRu
 alloy,
 and
 PtSn
 alloy
 catalysts
 [23].
They
 proposed
 that
 the
 superior
 CO-tolerance
 of
 the
 PtSn@Pt
 cata-
lyst
 was
 mainly
 due
 to
 the
 electronic
 effect
 of
 the
 PtSn
 core
 on
 the
Pt
 shell.
 In
 our
 cases,
 the
 catalysts
 prepared
 by
 the
 different
 reduc-
tion
 methods
 exhibited
 different
 catalytic
 activities,
 which
 were
not
 proportional
 to
 the
 amount
 of
 adsorbed
 CO,
 in

 XANES
spectrum
 of
 Pt–Sn/SiO2 catalyst
 precursor
 exhibited
 essentially
 the
same
 features
 as
 that
 of
 PtCl2.
 This
 suggests
 that
 Pt2+ species
 having
Pt
 Cl
 bond
 such
 as
 [PtCl4]2−adsorbed
 on
 SiO2 surface.
 After
 reduc-
tion,
 platinum
 in
 all
 catalysts
 possessed
 the
 similar
 feature
 as
 that
 of
Pt
 metal.
 The
 white
 line
 intensities
 of
 Pt/SiO2 (DR)
 and
 Pt–Sn/SiO2
(DI)  were
 similar
 each
 other,
 and
 slightly
 higher
 than
 that
 of
 Pt
foil.
 As
 for
 Pt–Sn/SiO2 (DR)
 and
 Pt–Sn/SiO2 (CR),
 their
 spectra
 were
close
 and
 the
 white
 line
 intensities
 were
 slightly
 less
 than
 that
 of
 Pt
foil.
 Since
 the
 intensity
 of
 the
 white
 line
 reﬂects
 the
 vacancy
 pop-
ulation
 of
 the
 5d
 orbital
 of
 Pt
 [24,25],
 the
 intensity
 of
 white
 line
decreases
 when
 Pt
 receives
 electrons
 from
 the
 surrounding
 atoms.
From
 this
 viewpoint,
 the
 decrease
 of
 white
 lines
 of
 Pt–Sn/SiO2 (DR)
and
 Pt–Sn/SiO2 (CR)
 strongly
 suggests
 an
 electron
 donation
 from
Sn
 to
 Pt
 and
 alloy
 formation
 between
 Pt
 and
 Sn.
 A
 similar
 result
 has
previously
 observed
 in
 Pt–Sn
 bimetallic
 catalysts
 by
 Uemura
 et
 al.
[15,16].
 They
 assigned
 this
 small
 decrease
 in
 the
 white
 line
 inten-
sity
 to
 the
 formation
 of
 a
 Pt–Sn
 alloy
 since
 the
 d-electron
 density
of
 platinum
 atoms
 will
 increase
 with
 alloying
 with
 Sn
 that
 shows
lower
 electronegativity
 than
 Pt.

 Combined
 with
 the

 these
 results
 suggest
that

 dryness,
 [PtCl6]2−species
 in

 was
 transformed
 to
 [PtCl4]2−and

After
 the
 following
 reduction
 treatment,
 [PtCl4]2−was
 decomposed
and
 reduced
 to
 Pt
 metal
 or
 Pt–Sn
 alloy.
 The
 EXAFS
 oscillation
 of
Pt–Sn/SiO2 (DI)
 catalyst
 is
 similar
 to
 that
 of
 Pt
 foil,
 although
 the
intensity
 of
 oscillation
 is
 weaker
 than
 that
 of
 Pt

 The
 peak
 around
0.25
 nm
 in
 the
 RSF
 of
 Pt–Sn/SiO2 (DI)
 catalyst
 is
 assignable
 to
 Pt–Pt
linkage.
 A
 smaller
 Pt–Pt
 contribution
 than
 that
 in
 Pt
 foil
 indicates
that
 small
 Pt
 nanoparticle
 (ca.
 2.2
 nm)
 was
 formed
 on
 Pt–Sn/SiO2
(DI).
In
 contrast,
 the
 EXAFS
 oscillation
 of
 Pt–Sn/SiO2 (DR)
 is
 signif-
icantly
 different
 from

 much
 weaker
 than
 that

 This
suggests
 the
 interference
 of

 by
 Sn
 and
 Pt,
 in
other
 words,
 the
 contribution
 of
 Pt–Sn
 linkage
 in
 addition
 to

 The
 EXAFS
 data
 for
 Pt–Sn/SiO2 (DR)
 catalyst
 were
 well
 ﬁtted
by
 assuming
 two
 shells
 (Pt–Pt
 and
 Pt–Sn
 linkages).
 No
 Pt–O

age

 observed,
 indicating
 that
 the

 supported
 Pt
 species
was
 completely
 reduced
 to

 state
 after
 the

 with

 The
 bond
 distances
 of
 Pt–Pt
 and
 Pt–Sn
of
 Pt–Sn/SiO2 (DR)
 catalyst
 were
 shorter
 than
 the
 crystallographic
values
 (Pt–Pt
 =
 0.283
 nm
 and
 Pt–Sn
 =
 0.283
 nm)
 in
 the
 Pt3Sn
 crystal
[26].
 The
 ratio
 of
 the
 coordination
 numbers,
 NPt–Sn/NPt-Pt,
 was
 0.49
which
 is
 compatible
 with
 0.50
 expected
 for
 Pt3Sn.

 (Fig.

 and
 the

 result
 in

 larger

 In
 the
 case
 of
 Pt–Sn/SiO2 (CR),
 the
 EXAFS

 is
 different
 from
 that
 of
 Pt–Sn/SiO2 (DR).
 Moreover,
 the
oscillation
 period
 was
 slightly
 different
 from
 that
 of

 These

 suggest
 the

 of
 PtSn

on
 Pt–Sn/SiO2 (CR).

 In

for
 Pt3Sn.
 This
 value
 is
 almost
 compatible
 with
 0.46
 for
 Pt–Sn/SiO2
(DR),
 considering
 a
 large
 uncertainty
 in
 the
 coordination
 number
due
 to
 the
 coexistence
 of
 small
 fraction
 of
 PtSn
 alloy
 and
 the
 inter-
ference
 of
 Pt
 and
 Sn
 scattering
 (Tables
 2
 and
 3).
 The
 coordination
number
 of
 O
 surrounding
 Sn
 atoms
 in
 Pt–Sn/SiO2 (DR)
 was
 ca.
 4,
which
 is
 smaller
 than
 that
 for
 bulk
 SnO2.
 This
 is
 probably
 due
 to
the
 formation
 of
 amorphous
 SnO2 phase
 and
 small
 SnO2 nanoparti-
cles.
 Based
 on
 these
 results,
 we  concluded
 that
 Pt3Sn
 alloy
 particles
were
 present
 together
 with
 highly
 dispersed
 SnO2 on
 Pt–Sn/SiO2
(DR).
Similarly,
 the
 white
 line
 intensity
 of
 Pt–Sn/SiO2 (CR)
 was
 slightly
higher
 than
 that
 of
 SnO,
 whereas
 much
 lower
 than
 that
 of
 SnO2.
Moreover,
 appreciable
 oscillation
 was
 also
 observed,
 even
 the
 posi-
tion
 is
 slightly
 different
 from
 that
 of
 Pt–Sn/SiO2 (DR).
 The
 RSF
 of
the
 Pt–Sn/SiO2 (CR)
 catalyst
 gave
 three
 weak
 peaks,
 at
 0.15,
 0.22,
and
 0.27
 nm.
 The
 ﬁrst
 peak
 corresponds
 to
 a
 Sn–O
 linkage
 sim-
ilar
 with
 Pt–Sn/SiO2 (DR).
 Although
 the
 positions
 of
 second
 and
third
 peaks
 are
 slightly
 different
 from
 those
 of
 Pt–Sn/SiO2 (DR),
these
 peaks
 seem
 to
 correspond
 to
 Sn–Pt
 linkage.
 All
 of
 these
 struc-
tural
 analyses
 strongly
 suggest
 the
 coexistence
 of
 highly

 Pt–Sn
 alloy
 whose
 local
 structure
 is
 different
 from
 that
of
 Pt3Sn
 alloy
 phase.
 Considering
 XRD
 pattern,
 we
 concluded
 that
PtSn
 alloy
 particle
 was
 regarded
 as
 the
 main
 species
 on
 Pt–Sn/SiO2
(CR)
 catalyst.

 Discussion
The
 results
 of
 propane
 dehydrogenation
 over
 Pt/SiO2 and
Pt–Sn/SiO2 catalysts
 show
 that
 the
 addition
 of
 tin
 to
 platinum
improves
 the
 catalytic
 performance.
 Structural
 analyses
 by
 XRD,
TEM,
 and
 XAFS
 techniques
 clearly
 indicate
 that
 the
 geometric
and
 electronic
 states
 of
 platinum
 remarkably
 changed

addition
 of
 tin
 followed
 by
 different
 reduction
 method.
 It
 appears
that
 the
 activity
 for
 propane
 dehydrogenation
 strongly
 depends
on
 the
 structure
 and
 electronic
 state
 of
 platinum
 and
 tin.
The
 Pt/SiO2 (DR)
 catalyst
 showed
 a
 low
 activity
 and
 stability.
This
 clearly
 indicates
 that
 monometallic
 platinum
 is
 not
 active
 and
is
 unstable.
 On
 the
 other
 hand,
 the
 Pt–Sn/SiO2 (DR)
 catalyst,
 on
which
 small
 Pt3Sn
 alloy
 nanoparticles
 were
 present
 as
 the
 main
phase,
 showed
 much
 higher
 activity
 than
 that
 of
 Pt/SiO2 (DR).
 These
results
 strongly
 suggest
 that
 Pt3Sn
 alloy
 acts
 as
 active
 site
 for
 dehy-
drogenation
 of
 propane.
 Among
 the
 Pt–Sn
 alloy
 phases
 (PtSn4,
PtSn2,
 Pt2Sn3,
 PtSn,
 and
 Pt3Sn
 [27,28]),
 a
 superior
 catalytic
 per-
formance
 was
 often
 assigned
 to
 Pt3Sn
 alloy
 phase
 [7,29–31].
 The
present
 work
 also
 showed
 that
 PtSn
 alloy
 was
 mainly
 formed
 on
 the
Pt–Sn/SiO2 (CR)
 catalyst,
 which
 showed
 a
 low
 activity,
 although
 the
conversion
 of
 propane
 was
 stable.
 Thus,
 it
 would
 appear
 that
 PtSn
alloy
 is
 not
 active
 for
 propane
 dehydrogenation
 despite
 the
 coex-
istence
 of
 platinum
 and
 tin.
 Likewise,
 Llorca
 et
 al.
 reported
 that
PtSn
 alloy
 showed
 high
 stability
 and
 selectivity
 in
 n-hexane
 dehy-
drogenation
 while
 the
 selectivity
 to
 benzene
 and
 hydrogenolysis
products
 were
 low
 [8].
 Recently,
 Yang
 et
 al.
 investigated
 the
 effect
of
 Sn
 on
 the
 activity
 and
 selectivity
 of
 Pt
 catalyst
 in
 propane
 dehy-
drogenation
 by
 using
 density
 functional
 calculation
 (DFT)
 method
[32].
 They
 reported
 that
 the
 introduction
 of
 Sn
 lowers
 the
 energy
barrier
 for
 propylene
 desorption
 and
 simultaneously
 increases
 the
activation
 energy
 for
 propylene
 dehydrogenation,
 which
 has
 a
 pos-
itive
 effect
 on
 the
 selectivity
 toward
 propylene
 production,
 and
proposed
 that
 the
 Pt3Sn
 bulk
 alloy
 is
 the
 most
 suitable
 for
 propane
dehydrogenation
 by
 considering
 the
 compromise
 between
 the
 cat-
alytic
 activity
 and
 selectivity.
In
 the
 case
 of
 the
 Pt–Sn/SiO2 (DI)  catalyst,
 XRD,
 CO
 pulse,
 TEM,
and
 XAFS
 results
 implied
 that
 monometallic
 platinum
 particle
 dec-
orated
 with
 small
 SnO2.
 When
 Sn
 was
 absent
 (Pt/SiO2 (DI)  catalyst),
the
 dispersion
 of
 Pt
 was
 quite
 low
 (data
 not
 shown),
 indicating
that
 the
 introduction
 of
 Sn
 suppressed
 the
 aggregation
 of
 Pt.
 This
implies
 the
 intimate
 contact
 of
 Sn
 with
 Pt.
 Although
 Pt3Sn
 alloy
phase
 was
 not
 detected
 by
 XRD
 and
 XAFS
 techniques,
 the
 conver-
sion
 of
 propane
 on
 the
 Pt–Sn/SiO2 (DI)
 catalyst
 was
 ca.
 60%
 of
 that
on
 the
 Pt–Sn/SiO2 (DR)
 catalyst
 having
 Pt3Sn
 alloy
 phase.
 This
 rel-
atively
 high
 activity
 is
 probably
 caused
 by
 the
 strong
 interaction
between
 the
 platinum
 metal
 particle
 and
 highly
 dispersed
 SnO2
such
 as
 electron
 transfer
 between
 SnO2 and
 Pt,
 or
 the
 formation
 of
Pt3Sn
 alloy
 phase
 at
 the
 interface
 of
 platinum
 metal
 particle
 and
highly
 dispersed
 SnO2.
 The
 low
 ratio
 of
 surface
 to
 bulk
 would
 make
the
 detection
 of
 formation
 of
 Pt3Sn
 alloy
 at
 the
 interface
 of
 plat-
inum
 metal
 particle
 and
 highly
 dispersed
 SnO2 by
 XAFS
 difﬁcult,
since
 XAFS
 analysis
 yields
 the
 average
 information
 of
 surface
 and
bulk.
 Therefore,
 further
 investigation
 is
 necessary
 to
 verify
 these
hypotheses.

 Conclusion
The
 Pt–Sn/SiO2 catalysts
 were
 reduced
 by
 three
 methods
 (direct
reduction
 (DR),
 decomposition
 in
 inert
 gas
 (DI)  and
 calcination-
reduction
 (CR)),
 and
 were
 examined
 for
 propane
 dehydrogenation.
The
 activities
 of
 the
 Pt–Sn/SiO2 catalysts
 were
 strongly
 inﬂuenced
by
 the
 reduction
 method.
 Decomposition
 in
 inert
 gas
 (DI)  method
resulted
 in
 the
 coexistence
 of
 Pt
 metal
 and
 highly
 dispersed
 SnO2
on
 SiO2,
 which
 showed
 the
 medium
 activity
 among
 the
 catalysts
tested.
 Direct
 reduction
 (DR)
 caused
 that
 Pt3Sn
 alloy
 nanoparti-
cle
 was
 mainly
 formed
 on
 Pt–Sn/SiO2 (DR)
 catalyst,
 which
 showed
the
 highest
 activity.
 Calcination-reduction
 (CR)
 method
 also
 led
to
 PtSn
 alloy
 formation.
 PtSn
 alloy
 nanoparticles
 were
 present
 as
the
 main
 phase.
 However,
 this
 catalyst
 was
 not
 active
 in
 propane
dehydrogenation.
 The
 relationship
 between
 activity
 and
 structure
of
 platinum-tin
 alloy
 suggested
 that
 Pt3Sn
 alloy
 acts
 as
 active
 site
for
 dehydrogenation
 of
 propane,
 whereas
 PtSn
 alloy
 shows
 low
 or
no
 activity.
