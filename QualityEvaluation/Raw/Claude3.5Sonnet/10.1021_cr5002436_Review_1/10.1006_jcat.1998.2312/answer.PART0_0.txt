[1] "The introduction of Ga (123), Zn (2436), and Pt (3743) species into H-ZSM5 increases the rate and selectivity of aromatization reactions and inhibits β-scission side reactions that lead to undesirable products."

[2] "Guisnet et al. (3, 4, 10, 18, 40, 46, 49) observed a higher initial rate of propene formation when metal cations (Ga) were added, leading them to suggest that propane dehydrogenation and naphthene dehydrogenation steps occur on the Ga cations."

[3] "Mole et al. (24) proposed that Zn cations in H-ZSM5 were involved in all dehydrogenation steps required for alkane aromatization, but only by catalyzing the recombinative desorption of H-atoms as H2, while all other steps occurred on acid sites."

[4] "Subsequent kinetic and isotopic tracer studies by Inui et al. (37, 50), le van Mao et al. (5, 7, 30, 51), and Iglesia et al. (8, 12, 14, 15, 29, 32) confirmed the involvement of metal cations in rate-determining hydrogen removal steps during propane reactions on Zn- and Ga-promoted H-ZSM5."

The literature does not provide sufficient information to fully compare and contrast noble metal-based catalysts and metal oxide-based catalysts for light olefin dehydrogenation. However, it does offer some relevant insights:

1. Both Pt (a noble metal) and metal oxides like Ga and Zn can be used to modify H-ZSM5 zeolites for alkane aromatization reactions.

2. The addition of Ga, Zn, and Pt species to H-ZSM5 increases the rate and selectivity of aromatization reactions while inhibiting undesirable β-scission side reactions.

3. Metal cations like Ga and Zn are involved in key steps of the dehydrogenation process:
   - Ga cations may be involved in propane dehydrogenation and naphthene dehydrogenation steps.
   - Zn cations catalyze the recombinative desorption of H-atoms as H2.

4. Multiple studies have confirmed that metal cations (Zn and Ga) play a role in rate-determining hydrogen removal steps during propane reactions on modified H-ZSM5 catalysts.

The document does not provide specific information about CrOx, indium, vanadium, or molybdenum oxide catalysts, nor does it discuss industrial applications or recent developments in the field of light olefin dehydrogenation.

这篇文献没有提供足够的信息来全面比较和对比用于轻质烯烃脱氢的贵金属基催化剂和金属氧化物基催化剂。然而，它确实提供了一些相关的见解：

1. Pt（一种贵金属）和Ga、Zn等金属氧化物都可以用来改性H-ZSM5沸石，用于烷烃芳构化反应。

2. 向H-ZSM5中添加Ga、Zn和Pt物种可以提高芳构化反应的速率和选择性，同时抑制不需要的β-裂解副反应。

3. 金属阳离子如Ga和Zn参与脱氢过程的关键步骤：
   - Ga阳离子可能参与丙烷脱氢和萘脱氢步骤。
   - Zn阳离子催化H原子的复合脱附，生成H2。

4. 多项研究证实，在改性的H-ZSM5催化剂上进行丙烷反应时，金属阳离子（Zn和Ga）在决定反应速率的氢移除步骤中起作用。

该文档没有提供关于CrOx、铟、钒或钼氧化物催化剂的具体信息，也没有讨论轻质烯烃脱氢领域的工业应用或最新发展。
