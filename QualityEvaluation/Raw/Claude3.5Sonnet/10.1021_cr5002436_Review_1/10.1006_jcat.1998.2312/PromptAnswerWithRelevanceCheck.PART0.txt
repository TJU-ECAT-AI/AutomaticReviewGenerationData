[1] "The introduction of Ga (123), Zn (2436), and Pt (3743) species into H-ZSM5 increases the rate and selectivity of aromatization reactions and inhibits β-scission side reactions that lead to undesirable products."

[2] "Guisnet et al. (3, 4, 10, 18, 40, 46, 49) observed a higher initial rate of propene formation when metal cations (Ga) were added, leading them to suggest that propane dehydrogenation and naphthene dehydrogenation steps occur on the Ga cations."

[3] "Mole et al. (24) proposed that Zn cations in H-ZSM5 were involved in all dehydrogenation steps required for alkane aromatization, but only by catalyzing the recombinative desorption of H-atoms as H2, while all other steps occurred on acid sites."

[4] "Subsequent kinetic and isotopic tracer studies by Inui et al. (37, 50), le van Mao et al. (5, 7, 30, 51), and Iglesia et al. (8, 12, 14, 15, 29, 32) confirmed the involvement of metal cations in rate-determining hydrogen removal steps during propane reactions on Zn- and Ga-promoted H-ZSM5."

The literature does not provide sufficient information to fully compare and contrast noble metal-based catalysts and metal oxide-based catalysts for light olefin dehydrogenation. However, it does offer some relevant insights:

1. Both Pt (a noble metal) and metal oxides like Ga and Zn can be used to modify H-ZSM5 zeolites for alkane aromatization reactions.

2. The addition of Ga, Zn, and Pt species to H-ZSM5 increases the rate and selectivity of aromatization reactions while inhibiting undesirable β-scission side reactions.

3. Metal cations like Ga and Zn are involved in key steps of the dehydrogenation process:
   - Ga cations may be involved in propane dehydrogenation and naphthene dehydrogenation steps.
   - Zn cations catalyze the recombinative desorption of H-atoms as H2.

4. Multiple studies have confirmed that metal cations (Zn and Ga) play a role in rate-determining hydrogen removal steps during propane reactions on modified H-ZSM5 catalysts.

The document does not provide specific information about CrOx, indium, vanadium, or molybdenum oxide catalysts, nor does it discuss industrial applications or recent developments in the field of light olefin dehydrogenation.

The literature does not provide a comprehensive comparison of noble metal-based catalysts and metal oxide-based catalysts for light olefin dehydrogenation. However, it does offer some insights on zinc-based catalysts:

1. Composition: The study focuses on Zn/H-ZSM5 catalysts, where zinc cations are introduced into the H-ZSM5 zeolite structure.

2. Effectiveness: Zinc cations in H-ZSM5 increase the rate and selectivity of aromatization reactions. They promote alkane dehydrogenation and subsequent hydrogen removal, leading to higher rates and selectivity for C6-C8 aromatic products.

3. Mechanism: Zn cations act as "portholes" for hydrogen desorption, facilitating the removal of hydrogen atoms as H2. This leads to the formation of unsaturated intermediates required for cyclization steps.

4. Advantages: Zn/H-ZSM5 catalysts decrease β-scission rates and the residence time of alkenes within oligomerization/β-scission cycles, which reduces undesirable side reactions.

The document does not provide information on industrial applications, recent developments, or comparisons with other metal oxide catalysts or noble metal-based catalysts like platinum. Therefore, a comprehensive comparison cannot be made based solely on this literature.

该文献并未提供关于贵金属基催化剂和金属氧化物基催化剂用于轻质烯烃脱氢的全面比较。然而，它确实提供了一些关于锌基催化剂的见解：

1. 成分：研究主要集中在Zn/H-ZSM5催化剂上，其中锌阳离子被引入H-ZSM5沸石结构中。

2. 有效性：H-ZSM5中的锌阳离子增加了芳构化反应的速率和选择性。它们促进烷烃脱氢和随后的氢气去除，导致C6-C8芳烃产品的更高速率和选择性。

3. 机理：锌阳离子充当氢脱附的"门户"，促进氢原子以H2的形式去除。这导致了环化步骤所需的不饱和中间体的形成。

4. 优势：Zn/H-ZSM5催化剂降低了β-裂解速率和烯烃在寡聚/β-裂解循环中的停留时间，从而减少了不良副反应。

该文档未提供关于工业应用、最新发展或与其他金属氧化物催化剂或贵金属基催化剂（如铂）的比较信息。因此，仅基于这篇文献无法进行全面比较。

The literature does not provide a comprehensive comparison of noble metal-based catalysts and metal oxide-based catalysts for light olefin dehydrogenation. However, it does offer some insights into the role of zinc and platinum in aromatization reactions, which are related to dehydrogenation processes.

The document mentions that the introduction of Ga, Zn, and Pt species into H-ZSM5 increases the rate and selectivity of aromatization reactions while inhibiting undesirable β-scission side reactions. Specifically for zinc:

1. Zinc cations decrease β-scission rates and reduce the residence time of alkenes in oligomerization/β-scission cycles. This leads to higher rates and selectivity for C6-C8 aromatic products.

2. Zinc promotes both alkane dehydrogenation and the subsequent removal of hydrogen as H2. This process produces unsaturated intermediates necessary for cyclization steps.

3. Zinc cations increase the rate and reversibility of adsorption-desorption steps. This affects surface hydrogen concentrations and the extent of dehydrogenation of adsorbed intermediates.

While the document does not provide detailed information on other metal oxide catalysts or a direct comparison with noble metal catalysts, it suggests that zinc-modified zeolites can be effective for dehydrogenation and aromatization processes. The ability of zinc to promote both dehydrogenation and hydrogen removal appears to be a key advantage in these reactions.

The literature does not discuss industrial applications, recent developments, or potential advantages of these catalysts in the specific context of light olefin dehydrogenation. More comprehensive research would be needed to fully address the question's scope.
