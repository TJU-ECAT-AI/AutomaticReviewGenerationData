[1] "The introduction of Ga (123), Zn (2436), and Pt (3743) species into H-ZSM5 increases the rate and selectivity of aromatization reactions and inhibits β-scission side reactions that lead to undesirable products."

[2] "Zn cations decrease β-scission rates and the residence time of alkenes within oligomerization/β-scission cycles, leading to higher rates and selectivity for the synthesis of C6-C8 aromatic products."

[3] "As Zn cations increase the rate (and reversibility) of adsorptiondesorption steps, surface hydrogen concentrations and the extent of dehydrogenation of adsorbed intermediates begin to reflect not only the rate at which hydrogen forms in C-H bond activation steps, but also the rate at which it is introduced into the surface via dissociative chemisorption steps involving H2 in the gas phase."

The literature does not provide a comprehensive comparison of noble metal-based catalysts and metal oxide-based catalysts for light olefin dehydrogenation. However, it does mention some information about zinc and platinum catalysts:

1. Both Zn and Pt species, when introduced into H-ZSM5, increase the rate and selectivity of aromatization reactions and inhibit undesirable β-scission side reactions.

2. Zinc cations specifically decrease β-scission rates and the residence time of alkenes in oligomerization/β-scission cycles, leading to higher rates and selectivity for C6-C8 aromatic products.

3. Zinc cations increase the rate and reversibility of adsorption-desorption steps, affecting surface hydrogen concentrations and the extent of dehydrogenation of adsorbed intermediates.

The document does not provide information on compositions, industrial applications, recent developments, or potential advantages of these catalysts in the field of light olefin dehydrogenation. It also does not discuss other metal oxide catalysts like CrOx, gallium, indium, vanadium, or molybdenum oxides in this context.

该文献并未对用于轻质烯烃脱氢的贵金属基催化剂和金属氧化物基催化剂进行全面比较。但是，它确实提到了一些关于锌和铂催化剂的信息：

1. 当引入H-ZSM5时，锌和铂物种都能增加芳构化反应的速率和选择性，并抑制不良的β-裂解副反应。

2. 锌阳离子特别能降低β-裂解速率和烯烃在寡聚/β-裂解循环中的停留时间，从而提高C6-C8芳烃产品的生成速率和选择性。

3. 锌阳离子增加了吸附-脱附步骤的速率和可逆性，影响表面氢浓度和吸附中间体的脱氢程度。

该文档没有提供这些催化剂在轻质烯烃脱氢领域的组成、工业应用、最新发展或潜在优势的信息。它也没有在这种背景下讨论其他金属氧化物催化剂，如CrOx、镓、铟、钒或钼氧化物。
