The literature does not provide a comprehensive comparison of noble metal-based catalysts and metal oxide-based catalysts for light olefin dehydrogenation. However, it does offer some insights on zinc-based catalysts:

1. Composition: The study focuses on Zn/H-ZSM5 catalysts, where zinc cations are introduced into the H-ZSM5 zeolite structure.

2. Effectiveness: Zinc cations in H-ZSM5 increase the rate and selectivity of aromatization reactions. They promote alkane dehydrogenation and subsequent hydrogen removal, leading to higher rates and selectivity for C6-C8 aromatic products.

3. Mechanism: Zn cations act as "portholes" for hydrogen desorption, facilitating the removal of hydrogen atoms as H2. This leads to the formation of unsaturated intermediates required for cyclization steps.

4. Advantages: Zn/H-ZSM5 catalysts decrease β-scission rates and the residence time of alkenes within oligomerization/β-scission cycles, which reduces undesirable side reactions.

The document does not provide information on industrial applications, recent developments, or comparisons with other metal oxide catalysts or noble metal-based catalysts like platinum. Therefore, a comprehensive comparison cannot be made based solely on this literature.

该文献并未提供关于贵金属基催化剂和金属氧化物基催化剂用于轻质烯烃脱氢的全面比较。然而，它确实提供了一些关于锌基催化剂的见解：

1. 成分：研究主要集中在Zn/H-ZSM5催化剂上，其中锌阳离子被引入H-ZSM5沸石结构中。

2. 有效性：H-ZSM5中的锌阳离子增加了芳构化反应的速率和选择性。它们促进烷烃脱氢和随后的氢气去除，导致C6-C8芳烃产品的更高速率和选择性。

3. 机理：锌阳离子充当氢脱附的"门户"，促进氢原子以H2的形式去除。这导致了环化步骤所需的不饱和中间体的形成。

4. 优势：Zn/H-ZSM5催化剂降低了β-裂解速率和烯烃在寡聚/β-裂解循环中的停留时间，从而减少了不良副反应。

该文档未提供关于工业应用、最新发展或与其他金属氧化物催化剂或贵金属基催化剂（如铂）的比较信息。因此，仅基于这篇文献无法进行全面比较。
