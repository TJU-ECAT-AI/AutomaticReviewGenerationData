[1] "The introduction of Ga (123), Zn (2436), and Pt (3743) species into H-ZSM5 increases the rate and selectivity of aromatization reactions and inhibits β-scission side reactions that lead to undesirable products."

[2] "Zn cations decrease β-scission rates and the residence time of alkenes within oligomerization/β-scission cycles, leading to higher rates and selectivity for the synthesis of C6-C8 aromatic products."

[3] "Zn cations promote not only alkane dehydrogenation, but also the subsequent removal of hydrogen as H2, leading to unsaturated intermediates required in cyclization steps."

[4] "Modifications of pentasil zeolites with exchanged Zn cations increase turnover rates, aromatic site-time yields, and the rate of hydrogen disposal during ethane, propane, and propene aromatization."

The literature does not provide a comprehensive comparison of noble metal-based catalysts and metal oxide-based catalysts for light olefin dehydrogenation. However, it does mention some information about zinc and platinum catalysts:

1. Both Zn and Pt species, when introduced into H-ZSM5, increase the rate and selectivity of aromatization reactions while inhibiting undesirable β-scission side reactions.

2. Zn cations specifically:
   - Decrease β-scission rates
   - Reduce the residence time of alkenes in oligomerization/β-scission cycles
   - Increase rates and selectivity for C6-C8 aromatic products
   - Promote alkane dehydrogenation
   - Enhance removal of hydrogen as H2
   - Lead to formation of unsaturated intermediates needed for cyclization
   - Increase turnover rates, aromatic site-time yields, and hydrogen disposal rates during ethane, propane, and propene aromatization

The document does not provide information on CrOx, gallium, indium, vanadium, or molybdenum oxide catalysts, nor does it discuss industrial applications or recent developments in the field. To fully answer the question, additional sources would be needed.

该文献并未提供贵金属基催化剂和金属氧化物基催化剂在轻质烯烃脱氢方面的全面比较。但是，它确实提到了一些关于锌和铂催化剂的信息：

1. 锌和铂物种当引入H-ZSM5时，都能增加芳构化反应的速率和选择性，同时抑制不良的β-裂解副反应。

2. 锌阳离子具体地：
   - 降低β-裂解速率
   - 减少烯烃在低聚/β-裂解循环中的停留时间
   - 提高C6-C8芳烃产品的生成速率和选择性
   - 促进烷烃脱氢
   - 增强氢以H2形式的去除
   - 导致形成环化所需的不饱和中间体
   - 在乙烷、丙烷和丙烯芳构化过程中提高转化率、芳烃场-时产率和氢处理速率

该文件没有提供关于CrOx、镓、铟、钒或钼氧化物催化剂的信息，也没有讨论该领域的工业应用或最新发展。要全面回答这个问题，需要额外的信息来源。
