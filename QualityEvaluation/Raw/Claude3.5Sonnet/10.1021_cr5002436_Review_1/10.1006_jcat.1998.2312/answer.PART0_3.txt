[1] "The introduction of Ga (123), Zn (2436), and Pt (3743) species into H-ZSM5 increases the rate and selectivity of aromatization reactions and inhibits β-scission side reactions that lead to undesirable products."

[2] "Zn cations decrease β-scission rates and the residence time of alkenes within oligomerization/β-scission cycles, leading to higher rates and selectivity for the synthesis of C6-C8 aromatic products."

[3] "Zn cations promote not only alkane dehydrogenation, but also the subsequent removal of hydrogen as H2, leading to unsaturated intermediates required in cyclization steps."

[4] "As Zn cations increase the rate (and reversibility) of adsorptiondesorption steps, surface hydrogen concentrations and the extent of dehydrogenation of adsorbed intermediates begin to reflect not only the rate at which hydrogen forms in C-H bond activation steps, but also the rate at which it is introduced into the surface via dissociative chemisorption steps involving H2 in the gas phase."

The literature does not provide a comprehensive comparison of noble metal-based catalysts and metal oxide-based catalysts for light olefin dehydrogenation. However, it does offer some insights into the role of zinc and platinum in aromatization reactions, which are related to dehydrogenation processes.

The document mentions that the introduction of Ga, Zn, and Pt species into H-ZSM5 increases the rate and selectivity of aromatization reactions while inhibiting undesirable β-scission side reactions. Specifically for zinc:

1. Zinc cations decrease β-scission rates and reduce the residence time of alkenes in oligomerization/β-scission cycles. This leads to higher rates and selectivity for C6-C8 aromatic products.

2. Zinc promotes both alkane dehydrogenation and the subsequent removal of hydrogen as H2. This process produces unsaturated intermediates necessary for cyclization steps.

3. Zinc cations increase the rate and reversibility of adsorption-desorption steps. This affects surface hydrogen concentrations and the extent of dehydrogenation of adsorbed intermediates.

While the document does not provide detailed information on other metal oxide catalysts or a direct comparison with noble metal catalysts, it suggests that zinc-modified zeolites can be effective for dehydrogenation and aromatization processes. The ability of zinc to promote both dehydrogenation and hydrogen removal appears to be a key advantage in these reactions.

The literature does not discuss industrial applications, recent developments, or potential advantages of these catalysts in the specific context of light olefin dehydrogenation. More comprehensive research would be needed to fully address the question's scope.

该文献并未提供关于贵金属基催化剂和金属氧化物基催化剂在轻烯烃脱氢方面的全面比较。然而，它确实对锌和铂在芳构化反应中的作用提供了一些见解，这些反应与脱氢过程有关。

文献提到，将Ga、Zn和Pt物种引入H-ZSM5可以提高芳构化反应的速率和选择性，同时抑制不良的β-裂解副反应。具体到锌：

1. 锌阳离子降低β-裂解速率，减少烯烃在低聚/β-裂解循环中的停留时间。这导致C6-C8芳烃产品的生成速率和选择性更高。

2. 锌既促进烷烃脱氢，又促进随后以H2形式去除氢。这个过程产生了环化步骤所需的不饱和中间体。

3. 锌阳离子增加了吸附-脱附步骤的速率和可逆性。这影响了表面氢浓度和吸附中间体的脱氢程度。

虽然文献没有提供其他金属氧化物催化剂的详细信息，也没有与贵金属催化剂进行直接比较，但它表明锌改性的沸石可以有效地用于脱氢和芳构化过程。锌能够同时促进脱氢和氢去除，这似乎是这些反应中的一个关键优势。

文献没有讨论这些催化剂在轻烯烃脱氢特定背景下的工业应用、最新发展或潜在优势。需要进行更全面的研究才能充分解答问题的全部范围。
