The redispersion of platinum on y-Alr03, SiOr, and TiOz is experimentally studied by means of 
hydrogen chemisorption, X-ray diffraction, transmission electron microscopy, temperature-pro- 
grammed reduction, and cyclohexene hydrogenation reaction. The increase in dispersion following 
treatment in oxygen below 600C occurs only for W-y-A&OS. For miO*, 
only the presence of 
chlorine during oxidation brings about a significant redispersion. For Pt/SiOZ, 
redispersion does not 
occur under any condition. Redispersion can occur only in the presence of platinum oxide which 
could be stabilized by forming a complex with the support. The method for determining whether or 
not redispersion will occur for any systems and the conditions needed for redispersion are dis- 
cussed.

INTRODUCTION 
Although supported metal catalysts are 
thermally 
stable in general, changes in 
metal surface area still occur with use or 
treatment for a long period at elevated tem- 
perature. The resulting loss of metal sur- 
face area generally leads to a decrease in 
catalytic 
activity 
and, very often, to a 
change in the reaction selectivity (I), and it 
is necessary to restore the original activity 
of sintered catalysts by a regeneration pro- 
cess, termed redispersion (2). The redisper- 
sion of crystallites of sintered supported 
metal catalyst is therefore an important 
problem. Many investigators (2-7) have 
observed an increase in platinum surface 
area during thermal treatment of supported 
platinum catalysts in oxygen-containing at- 
mosphere. Almost all studies of redisper- 
sion have been restricted to platinum-alu- 
mina system, and carried out with model 
supported catalyst systems. 
Several models have been proposed to 
explain the redispersion phenomena. The 
first attributes the redispersion to a physical 
splitting of the supported particles (8-20. 
I Present address: Department of Chemical Engi- 
neering, Tulane University, New Orleans, La. 70118. 
A second model assumes the formation of 
various types of two-dimensional 
disper- 
sions over the support surface (2,5-7, 
II- 
15). A third model invokes strong metal- 
support interaction (SMSI) which produces 
a larger surface area through spreading of 
particles in hydrogen atmosphere (16). A 
fourth model involves the intraparticle re- 
dispersion of alloy catalysts (17). However, 
the conditions and mechanisms for redis- 
persion of metal crystallites are not yet 
clear. 
From the reported results which some- 
times contradict each other, many ques- 
tions arise: Does redispersion depend on 
treatment time (2, 20, Z8)? How is the in- 
crease in dispersion affected by the initial 
dispersion (2)? Is it possible that dispersion 
after treatment in oxygen above 600C is 
higher than the initial dispersion (2, Z3)? Is 
redispersion possible even for catalysts 
heavily sintered in oxygen (I, 2, Z8)? Does 
redispersion take place above the decom- 
position temperature of the solid platinum 
oxide (19, 20)? How does the addition of 
chlorine during oxidation affect the redis- 
persion of sintered catalysts (18, 22)? Does 
redispersion occur in hydrogen atmosphere 
(16, 22)?

The objectives of this study are three- 
fold: first, to obtain some answers to the 
above questions; second, to select reason- 
able mechanisms; and third, to search for a 
simple method for determining whether or 
not, and under what conditions, the redis- 
persion occurs. To these ends, hydrogen 
chemisorption, 
X-ray diffraction 
(XRD), 
transmission electron microscopy (TEM), 
temperature-programmed reduction (TPR), 
and cyclohexene hydrogenation 
reaction 
were carried out on platinum catalysts sup- 
ported on r-AlzO,, SiOZ, and Ti02. 
EXPERIMENTAL 
METHODS 
Materials. 
The support materials used in 
this study were -y-A1203 (T-374) from 
United Catalytic Inc., SiOZ 
(Grade 57) from 
Davison Co., and Ti02 (Cab-0-Ti) from 
Cabot Corp. The 2 wt% catalysts were pre- 
pared by impregnation with chloroplatinic 
acid. The impregnated catalysts were dried 
in air for 24 hr at 150C. All catalysts were 
reduced for 12 hr in HZ stream at 400C un- 
less reduced catalysts were to be examined. 
Hydrogen 
(99.999%) 
and 
helium 
(99.999%) from Matheson Corp. were fur- 
ther purified before use. Oxygen (99.995%, 
Linde) and nitrogen (99.999%, Matheson) 
were used without further purification. Cy- 
clohexene (G. R. Grade, Tokyo Chemistry 
Ind.) was purified by distilling in the pres- 
ence of sodium metal. 
Chemisorption 
measurements. 
Adsorp- 
tion measurements were performed on a 
conventional BET apparatus equipped with 
a capacitance manometer (Accusorb 2100E 
by Micromeritics 
Instrument Corp.). All 
samples except PtiTiO, were reduced in 
situ at 400C in hydrogen atmosphere for 2 
hr. The reduced samples were heated to 
450C and then evacuated at the same tem- 
perature for 1 hr. The samples were then 
cooled under dynamic vacuum to room 
temperature. Pt/TiO, sample was reduced 
at 300C for 2 hr and then evacuated at the 
same temperature for 1 hr. Longer period 
of reduction and evacuation did not affect 
the subsequent chemisorption results. Up- 
takes were determined at 25 +- 3C on the 
reduced and evacuated samples. Typically 
40 min was allowed for each uptake point. 
At least two successive determinations of 
hydrogen adsorption uptake were made on 
each sample. 
X-Ray diffraction 
(XRD). X-Ray diffrac- 
tion line broadening was measured on a 
Diano Model 8000 diffractometer using Ni- 
filtered CuK, radiation. A slow scan of 
0.4(28)/min was carried out for 28 from 35 
to 55 and from 75 to 85. Slow scan pro- 
vided greater sensitivity for line broadening 
measurements (24). 
Transmission 
electron 
microscopy 
(TEM). The electron microscopy was per- 
formed using a JEM IOOC transmission 
electron microscope. The samples for TEM 
were prepared by ultrasonic dispersion af- 
ter the catalyst powder was ground and 
passed through a 300 mesh screen. 
Sintering 
treatments. 
Sintering experi- 
ments were done in hydrogen and oxygen 
streams at temperatures ranging from 300 
to 800C. After sintering at a specified tem- 
perature for a fixed time interval, the sam- 
ples were cooled rapidly to ambient tem- 
perature and stored in a stoppered bottle 
until further use. 
Catalytic 
reaction. The hydrogenation of 
cyclohexene was carried out in a quartz U- 
tube microreactor, 8 mm i.d. and 20 cm 
long. Hydrogen stream at 100 ml/min en- 
tered the saturator kept in a constant tem- 
perature bath regulated at 35C to achieve a 
hydrogen to cyclohexene ratio of 4.52. Ni- 
trogen stream at 100 ml/min, used as a di- 
luent, was mixed with reactants and passed 
through the reactor heated in a water jacket 
kept at 60C. The reaction products were 
analyzed by a Varian 1420 Gas Chromato- 
graph with a column packed with 20% Car- 
bowax 20M on Chromosorb W. 
Temperature-programmed 
reduction 
(TPR). TPR was done in a flow system sim- 
ilar to that described by Robertson et al. 
(24). The reducing gas was passed through 
the reference side of the thermal conductiv- 
ity cell, then through a quartz U-tube reac-

tor and a cold trap kept at -78C back 
through the sample side of the thermal con- 
ductivity cell. A small amount of catalysts 
was calcined in oxygen at a given tempera- 
ture and placed in a cold bath at -78C. 
The heating rate was 6Wmin and reducing 
gas composition was Hz/N2 = 5%/95%. The 
heating during TPR was regulated around 
room temperature by a programming con- 
troller, but in the range below room temper- 
ature, the catalyst was allowed to warm up 
naturally by simply removing it from the 
cold bath. The heating in the low tempera- 
ture region was therefore not necessarily 
linear. 
RESULTS 
Chemisorption Measurements 
Typical room temperature isotherms of 
Hz for 2 wt% Ptly-A&O3 catalyst are shown 
in Fig. 1. The net irreversible uptake was 
obtained by subtracting the reversible por- 
tion from the total uptake. The adsorption 
of HZ on supports was found to be totally 
reversible in preliminary experiments (26). 
Since the amount strongly, i.e., irrevers- 
ibly, adsorbed is associated with the metal, 
only the irreversible adsorption is used for 
comparison of the changes in dispersion.

prepared catalysts. Since the dispersion of 
fresh Ptly-AlzOJ was too great, they were 
sintered in hydrogen atmosphere to provide 
various initial dispersions shown in the ta- 
ble before the redispersion study, whereas 
fresh catalysts were used in the cases of Pt/ 
SiOZ 
and Pt/TiOZ. Unless otherwise stated, 
PtI-y-Alz03 sintered in hydrogen

sphere for 3 hr was used.

the maximum dispersion occurred at about 
55OC, while for Pt/SiOz and Pt/TiOz the 
change in dispersion was small below 
600C. For all catalysts the dispersion de- 
creased severely after treatment above 
600C. The sintering rate was somewhat 
slower for Pt/y-AlzOj than for other sup- 
ported platinum catalysts. The experiments 
of Fig. 2 were carried out with different 
samples at various temperatures, but the 
results had nearly the same trend even 
when the same experiments had been car- 
ried out with a single sample. It is worth 
noting that dispersion after treatment above 
600C was always smaller than the initial 
dispersion, which is contrary to the results 
reported by Fiedorow and Wanke (2). 
Table 2 summarizes the changes in dis- 
persion of Pt/y-A1203 after repeated oxida- 
tion-reduction 
cycles. The catalysts in Ta- 
bles 1 and 2 are prepared by the same 
method but subjected to different sintering 
treatments. The dispersion increased after 
each oxidation-reduction 
treatment and 
reached the saturation value. The higher 
the initial dispersion, the greater the satura- 
tion value was. Since redispersion was 
found to be insensitive to the treatment 
time in preliminary experiments, repeated 
oxidation-reduction 
cycles might have ad- 
vantages in regeneration processes. 
The effect of dispersion on the redisper- 
sion capacity, defined as the ratio of regen- 
erated dispersion after treatment in oxygen 
at 520C to sintered dispersion before redis- 
persion treatment, is plotted in Fig. 3. In 
the case of mildly sintered catalysts the re- 
dispersion capacity had maximum with sin- 
tered dispersion, while the redispersion ca- 
pacity decreased monotonically for heavily 
sintered catalysts. In general, redispersion 
capacity of mildly sintered catalysts was 
larger than that of heavily sintered cata- 
lysts. On the basis of this result, the hy- 
pothesis that redispersion becomes easier 
as metal particle size increases must be 
judged incorrect. 
Since treatment in oxygen atmosphere 
for 2 hr at 520C occurs frequently, we shall 
refer to this as the redispersiun 
con& 
tion. The changes in dispersions of four 
different Ptl-y-AllO 
samples after various 
consecutive treatments are shown in Table 
3. The increase in dispersion for all cata- 
lysts occurred clearly under the redisper- 
sion condition. 
The addition of chlorine 
during oxidation 
under the redispersion 
condition brought about a significant in- 
crease in dispersion. The addition of water, 
however, led to a decrease in dispersion 
even at redispersion condition. For oxida- 
tion at temperature higher than the redis- 
persion condition, 
dispersion decreased 
even in the presence of chlorine. On the 
other hand, the addition of chlorine during 
reduction showed a significant decrease in 
dispersion, but it could be increased if the 
sample was oxidized at a moderate temper- 
ature which did not lead to Pt particle size

 Hydrogen atmosphere; values in parentheses, treatment temperature 
change. This result implies that the metal- 
support interaction became stronger in the 
presence of chlorine (26). This strong inter- 
action 
produced 
severely suppressed 
chemisorption capacity, which is in agree- 
ment with the hypothesis put forward by 
Dautzenberg and Wolters (I). Further- 
more, redispersion occurred even for cata- 
lysts heavily sintered in oxygen atmosphere 
as shown in Table 3. 
XRD and TEM Analyses 
Since the intensity decreases 
and the line 
width increases 
as the dispersion increases, 
the changes in dispersion can be measured 
qualitatively by the change of diffraction 
peaks. Figure 4 shows the X-ray diffraction 
patterns of a given sample of IV?-Al203 
treated consecutively at various conditions 
in the order, a, b, c, d, e, f. The intensity of 
diffraction peak increased after hydrogen 
treatment at 8OOC, 
decreased somewhat 
after treatment at the redispersion condi- 
tion, but greatly increased again after oxy- 
gen treatment at 800C. This result implies 
that Pt metal was not changed even in the 
presence of HCl(27). Furthermore, a small 
decrease 
in intensity was observed after the 
redispersion treatment. Changes in X-ray 
diffraction patterns for Pt/Si02 and PUTi 
were also investigated. For Pt/SiOz the in- 
tensity did not decrease under any condi- 
tion. In the case of PUTi 
the intensity did 
not decrease during treatment at the redis- 
persion condition alone, but the presence 
of 
chlorine during oxidation brought about a 
significant decrease in intensity. 
Figure 5 shows micrographs of Ptly- 
Al203 catalyst under various conditions. 
These micrographs reveal clearly the de- 
crease of Pt particle size during oxidation 
and more significant decrease 
of Pt particle 
size in the presence of chlorine. Micro- 
graphs of PtfSiOz 
and Pt/TiOz show that Pt 
particle size did not decrease 
during oxida- 
tion. From these observations we note that 
the results of chemisorption, XRD and 
TEM analyses agree well with each other. 
Evidence of Metal Oxide-Support 
Znteractions

num oxide. The high temperature peak was 
due to surface reduction of titania to non- 
stoichiometric oxide (28) and did not ap- 
pear in the other two catalysts. Even 
though the reduction of pure Ti02 occurred 
above 600C Pt/Ti02 could be reduced at 
lower temperature since the reduction of 
the support could be catalyzed by Pt (16, 
26). In the case of PtlY-A&03, however, a 
single reduction 
peak was observed at 
about 300C. This result shows that the or- 
der of interaction of platinum oxide with 
supports under the redispersion condition 
is Pt/y-AlZ03 > Pt/TiOz > Pt/SiOz 2 bulk 
PtO2. 
Figure 7 presents the TPR profiles of Pt/ 
y-Al203 at various oxidation temperatures. 
The reduction of platinum oxide took place 
at increasingly higher temperature as the 
oxidation temperature increased. This sug- 
gests that higher oxidation temperature en- 
hanced interaction of the platinum oxide 
with the y-Al0 support. The TPR after 
treatment at oxidation temperature higher 
than the redispersion condition did not pro- 
duce the high temperature reduction peak 
and showed a small peak below room tem- 
perature. 
The formation and stability of platinum 
oxide complexed with support have been 
generally considered crucial to the redis- 
persion process. To investigate this chemi- 
sorption experiments were performed in 
two different ways. The hydrogen uptakes

sequent reduction. The ratios of these up- 
takes to 
the 
initial 
normal 
uptakes, 
measured after reduction at 400C without 
oxidation, are given in Figs. 8 and 9. Figure 
8 shows that for a single sample of Ptly- 
A1203 treated consecutively hydrogen up- 
takes before reduction decreased monoton- 
ically regardless of the dispersion (29). 
Very interesting is the result that redisper- 
sion can occur only when after reduction 
hydrogen uptakes are greater than those be-

SiOz 
and Pt/TiOz, on the other hand, hydro- 
gen uptakes after reduction were never 
greater than those before reduction for any 
oxidation temperature; that is, redispersion 
did not take place for these catalysts. 
For all three catalysts the hydrogen up- 
takes measured before and after reduction 
agreed with each other above the tempera- 
ture ranges of the decomposition of plati- 
num oxide. From these observations we 
conclude that redispersion can occur only 
in the presence of platinum oxide which 
could be stabilized by forming complexes 
with r-A&O,. Dispersion increases 
with ox- 
idation temperature below the redispersion 
condition because of the enhancement of 
the interaction of platinum oxide with y- 
A1203 
support. Redispersion cannot occur 
even in the presence of platinum oxide un- 
less this compound is stabilized by com- 
plexing with supports.

Al203 after treatment in oxygen and hydro- 
gen atmospheres 
are shown in Fig. 10. 
Dur- 
ing reduction the activity remained nearly 
constant up to 5OOC, 
and then decreased, 
whereas during oxidation the activity in- 
creased below the redispersion -condition 
and decreased sharply above it. .The activ- 
ity for the other two catalysts decreased 
monotonically as the oxidation temperature 
increased. It was also noted that treating 
high temperature reduced Pt/TiOz samples 
with oxygen restored their catalytic activity 
which increased up to 500C; then dropped 
sharply. This increase in activity could be 
attributed not to the redispersion of the 
metal, but to the destruction of the SMSI 
since the redispersion phenomenon was not 
observed in the case of nitrogen- and oxy- 
gen-sintered catalysts (26). 
DISCUSSION 
Redispersion of supported Rt catalysts in 
oxygen atmosphere has been explained by 
means 
of one of the two models: one attrib- 
utes the increase in dispersion to the actual 
physical splitting of the particles, which is 
based on crystallite migration model (30), 
while the other invokes the formation and 
spreading of platinum oxide layers on the 
support. In general, particle splitting should 
occur more easily as particle size increased 
(9), but redispersion was observed even in

catalysts with very small particle size. Ac- 
cording to the splitting model dispersion 
would increase as treatment time increased 
(IO), but the dispersion observed in this 
work was relatively 
insensitive 
to the 
length of treatment. The resulting disper- 
sion should be independent of initial parti- 
cle size since splitting occurred continu- 
ously until it reached the critical particle 
size (IO), but the observed redispersion ca- 
pacity had a maximum with the variation in 
initial dispersion. According to the splitting 
model the increase in dispersion should be 
independent of the surface area of the sup- 
port (2), but the observed degree of redis- 
persion increased as the available surface 
area increased. Furthermore, 
Yao et al. 
(15) reported that large particles could con- 
tinue to be observed after redispersion, and 
Stulga et al. (31) proposed that it would be 
more likely for fracture to take place within 
the substrate than in the particle. From this 
we conclude that the splitting model cannot 
account for redispersion. The formation 
and spreading of platinum oxide layers on 
the support appears to be the more reason- 
able mechanism. This mechanism based on 
molecular migration (19) involves surface 
migration and vapor phase transport of the 
miating species to trap sites on the sup- 
port 
that have large interactions 
and 
spreading of thin oxidized leading edge of 
the crystallites. 
The results of this study show that treat- 
ment below 600C in oxygen atmosphere 
leads to increase in dispersion for Ptly- 
AlzO, only. For Pt/SiOz redispersion does 
not occur under any condition, while for Ptl 
TiOz the increase in dispersion was ob- 
served only in the presence of chlorine 
during oxidation. 
For all catalysts the 
dispersion decreases drastically after treat- 
ment above 600C. Both continuum con- 
cept of surface tension and discrete concept 
of moiecular migration are invoked to ex- 
plain the results obtained here. 
When a metal particle is in thermody- 
namic equilibrium on a solid support, the 
three characteristic surface tensions are re- 
lated through Youngs equation 
am - fJ-ms 
= umg 
case 
where u is the surface tension, $ is the wet- 
ting angle, and the subscripts gs, ms, and 
mg refer to the gas-support, metal-support, 
and metal-gas interfaces, respectively. If 
the various metal-gas-support systems are 
analyzed in terms of this relationship some 
very 
interesting 
predictions 
emerge. 
Spreading is due to the changes in surface 
tension produced by the oxidation of Pt. At 
550C where maximum redispersion report- 
edly occurs, uggs 
for r-Al,O, is 793 ergs/cm, 
that for Ti02 is 582 ergs/cm and that for Ptl 
Si02 is 268 ergs/cm (32). Thus ags is ar- 
ranged in the order, y-A&OX > Ti02 > Si02. 
cr,, will be smaller for Pt/-A1203 than for 
Pt/TiOz since metal oxide-support interac- 
tion is greater for Ptly-A&03, and SMSI is 
broken for Pt/TiOz during the oxidation 
treatment (26, 26), and the probability of 
surface P&aluminate formation is higher 
than that of Pt-titanate (32). Vannice ob- 
served that Si02-supported metals could 
act in the same way as the respective un- 
supported metals, confirming the lack of 
strong interactions with the support. There- 
fore, the order of u-,, is Ptly-Al203 < Ptl 
Ti02 < PtlSiO,. This is supported by TPR 
results. As gmg is the same in these sys- 
tems, the differences seen for cr,, and ems 
lead to the conclusion that the probability 
of wetting by a two-dimensional layer of 
platinum oxide is much higher on alumina 
than on titania or silica supports. It is there- 
fore not surprising to find that redispersion 
of sintered metal particles is observed only 
for Ptly-A1203 system in oxygen atmo- 
sphere. When platinum oxide is decom- 
posed at higher temperatures, metal-sup- 
port interaction is small for Ptly-Al,03 since 
the platinum particles form once again and 
platinum does not wet alumina (20). The 
platinum atoms are probably very mobile 
and will be captured by the particles upon 
collision, thus sintering rate is accelerated 
regardless of the supports in oxygen atmo- 
sphere at high temperature. 
REDISPERSION 
OF PLATINUM 
289 
On the other hand, the increase in disper- 
sion may be attributed to the formation of 
mobile species presumably composed of 
solid and gaseous 
platinum oxide. A part of 
the migrating species may be trapped in 
high energy sites of the support and thus 
form new particles. This is confirmed by 
the experimental results that the reversible 
hydrogen uptakes decreased drastically af- 
ter redispersion treatment, and that the de- 
gree of redispersion increased when revers- 
ible hydrogen uptake was large, even in the 
case of smaller dispersion. 
The transport of migrating species from 
the particle to the support can take two 
paths: below 600C 
the surface diffusion is 
predominant while at higher temperature 
the vapor transport dominates because 
gas- 
eous PtO;! can exist at high temperature 
where solid Pt02 is unstable (15). Observed 
results can be interpreted in terms of the 
difference between reactivation and ther- 
mal deactivation. If reactivation is greater 
than thermal deactivation, redispersion is 
obtained. The extent of reactivation can be 
estimated from the fact that while redisper- 
sion clearly occurs in the Ptly-Al203 sys- 
tem, it does not in Pt/SiO* where only ther- 
mal deactivation takes place. This is 
illustrated in Fig. 2. Below 600C 
the forma- 
tion of mobile species increases with in- 
creasing temperature and the energy of ad- 
hesion between the oxide formed and the 
support is very strong, therefore the ob- 
served phenomenon is that of redispersion. 
On the other hand, at higher temperature 
the observed phenomenon is thought to be 
that of sintering because the species 
trapped on the support can move to large 
particles by overcoming the interaction en- 
ergy barrier as temperature is raised. If, 
however, the binding energy between oxide 
and support remains strong enough even at 
high temperatures, redispersion may occur. 
It is possible under this situation that dis- 
persion after treatment in oxygen above 
600C is higher than the initial dispersion. 
The experimental evidence of redispersion 
by vapor transport was reported by Baker 
et al. at 800C (19) and Ruckenstein and 
Chu at 750C (20). 
When equilibration between thermal de- 
activation and reactivation takes place, the 
observed dispersion is unchanged. This 
equilibrium depends on experimental con- 
ditions, especially chlorine concentration 
(22), oxygen partial pressure (7), and the 
presence of acid sites on the support (18). 
Since interfacial energy and the concentra- 
tion of mobile phase change with particle 
size, the particle size is expected to affect 
the degree of redispersion. The spreading 
model is probably more valid for relatively 
large particles, while the trapping model is 
valid for small particle sizes. 
It is apparent that consecutive treatments 
bring about the increases in dispersion al- 
though the rate of dispersion decreases 
with each cycle. The equilibrium between 
redispersion and sintering may be obtained 
during the repeated oxidation-reduction 
cycles. Equilibrium may be obtained at 
much lower dispersion as the initial disper- 
sion decreases. Since the observed redis- 
persion is relatively independent of the 
treatment time and the formation of plati- 
num oxide takes place only a few layers 
thick (34), continued generation of mobile 
oxides is needed to redisperse the sintered 
catalyst until dispersion reaches the equi- 
librium value. Compared with the degree of 
redispersion of catalysts sintered in oxy- 
gen, that of catalysts sintered in hydrogen 
is larger. Furthermore, for catalysts sin- 
tered in oxygen, the dispersion obtained af- 
ter treatment in hydrogen at high tempera- 
ture followed by redispersion treatment is 
much greater than the dispersion obtained 
after only redispersion treatment. 
Another interesting result is the effect of 
chlorine addition. The addition of chlorine 
during oxidation brings about a significant 
increase in the dispersion for the Ptly-Al03 
system as well as for the Pt/TiO 
system in 
which redispersion does not occur during 
treatment in oxygen alone. It has been 
found (28) that in the presence of oxygen, 
chlorine enhances the formation of an oxi- 
290 
LEE AND KIM 
dizing form of platinum as indicated by the 
dissolution of the metal at room tempera- 
ture. The evidence of strong interaction be- 
tween the migrating species and the support 
in the presence of enough chlorine is found 
in the formation of oxychloroplatinum 
com- 
plexes which are strongly bonded to the 
support (22) and in the fact that chlorinated 
compounds create oxidizing sites and de- 
stroy reducing centers on the support (18). 
The strong acceptor sites of support were 
probably enhanced by the addition of chlo- 
rine and an electron-deficient state of plati- 
num due to these oxidizing sites was re- 
sponsible for the significant redispersion 
observed. 
In general, since acidic sites of the sup- 
ports are oxidizing sites and SiOz support 
has no acidity, redispersion is not expected 
for Pt/Si02 even in the presence of chlorine. 
Furthermore, unreduced catalyst showed a 
significant redispersion compared with re- 
duced catalyst since the chlorine remaining 
after impregnation enhanced the generation 
of oxidizing sites. This accounts for the 
beneficial effect of calcination prior to re- 
duction in the preparation of highly dis- 
persed platinum catalysts. 
Adsorbed water weakens the metal-sup- 
port interaction and therefore increases the 
mobility of platinum particles. While water 
could oxidize some metals, in general the 
noble metal such as platinum is difficult to 
oxidize with water. However, the presence 
of water during oxidation even under redis- 
persion condition results in the removal of 
chlorine and regeneration of surface OH 
groups (18); consequently, oxidizing sites 
are destroyed and sintering rather than re- 
dispersion occurs. 
A further interesting result is the forma- 
tion of a complex between the platinum ox- 
ide and the support. From the results of 
TPR it is known that Ptl-y-Al203 exhibits 
stronger interaction between the metal and 
the support as compared with Pt/Si02 and 
Pt/TiOZ. This indicates that although plati- 
num oxide can be formed for all catalysts 
when treated in an oxygen atmosphere be- 
low 600C only the Ptly-A1203 system 
would be stabilized by forming a complex 
with alumina. The formation of the com- 
plex, which would then be responsible for 
the high dispersion of platinum, has been 
observed by many investigators (5, 7, 8). 
Furthermore, Fig. 7 shows that the forma- 
tion of this complex is enhanced as oxida- 
tion temperature increases. As shown in 
TPR results, it is difficult to reduce this 
complex. Thus, hydrogen uptake after re- 
duction is larger than that before reduction 
for Ptly-A&O3 under conditions where re- 
dispersion is possible. For systems other 
than Ptl-y-A1203, however, hydrogen up- 
takes after reduction never exceed those 
before reduction. Therefore, if one were to 
determine whether redispersion occurs or 
not for any system, chemisorption mea- 
surements with two different methods are 
needed. 
CONCLUSIONS 
Dispersion for Ptly-Al203 increases after 
treatment in oxygen below 600C. For Pt/ 
SiOz redispersion does not occur under any 
condition covered in this study. In the case 
of Pt/TiOz, redispersion occurs only in the 
presence of chlorine during oxidation. The 
repeated oxidation-reduction 
cycles play 
an important role in the regeneration of sin- 
tered supported platinum catalysts. Redis- 
persion capacity has a maximum when 
dispersion 
is varied, 
and the rate of 
redispersion of mildly sintered catalyst is 
faster than that of heavily sintered catalyst. 
The addition of chlorine during oxidation 
enhances redispersion, while the addition 
of water inhibits redispersion. 
Redispersion can occur only under a con- 
dition in which interaction is strong enough 
to produce surface complex between the 
platinum oxide and the support. The mech- 
anism for redispersion (2, 24) based on the 
molecular migration model which involves 
spreading of platinum oxide and trapping of 
migrating species can best account for 
results obtained in this study.
