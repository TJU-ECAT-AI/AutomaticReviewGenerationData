[1] "The principal by-product of ethane dehydrogenation is hydrogen, a vital commodity that can be used for a variety of applications in a refinery"

[2] "The most active catalyst for ethane dehydrogenation is platinum; however, in its pure form, it exhibits low ethene selectivity and rapid coke deposition, which contributes to catalyst deactivation"

[3] "The addition of a second metal, such as tin, indium, or gallium, to platinum has been found to be effective in increasing ethene selectivity and suppressing coke formation"

[4] "Previous studies have shown that Mg(Al)O suppresses thermal cracking of ethane and minimizes the formation of coke on the support"

The literature primarily focuses on platinum-based catalysts for ethane dehydrogenation, with some mention of other metal additives. It does not provide a comprehensive comparison between noble metal-based catalysts and metal oxide-based catalysts for light olefin dehydrogenation. However, based on the limited information provided, we can discuss some aspects of platinum-based catalysts:

Composition: Platinum is the primary active component, often modified with additives like tin, indium, or gallium. The support material mentioned is Mg(Al)O, which helps suppress thermal cracking and coke formation.

Effectiveness: Platinum is described as the most active catalyst for ethane dehydrogenation. However, pure platinum suffers from low ethene selectivity and rapid coke deposition, leading to deactivation.

Recent developments: The addition of secondary metals (tin, indium, gallium) to platinum has been found to increase ethene selectivity and suppress coke formation. The study also investigates the effects of particle size and composition on catalyst performance.

Potential advantages: Platinum-based catalysts offer high activity for ethane dehydrogenation. When modified with secondary metals, they can achieve improved selectivity and stability.

Industrial applications: While not explicitly stated, the focus on improving platinum-based catalysts suggests their relevance to industrial applications in ethane dehydrogenation.

The document does not provide information on metal oxide-based catalysts like CrOx, gallium, indium, vanadium, zinc, and molybdenum oxides for comparison. Therefore, a comprehensive comparison between noble metal-based and metal oxide-based catalysts cannot be made based solely on this literature.

这篇文献主要关注了用于乙烷脱氢的铂基催化剂,并提到了一些其他金属添加剂。它没有提供贵金属基催化剂与金属氧化物基催化剂在轻烯烃脱氢方面的全面比较。但是,根据提供的有限信息,我们可以讨论铂基催化剂的一些方面:

成分:铂是主要的活性成分,通常用锡、铟或镓等添加剂进行改性。文中提到的载体材料是Mg(Al)O,有助于抑制热裂解和积碳形成。

有效性:铂被描述为乙烷脱氢最活跃的催化剂。然而,纯铂的乙烯选择性低,积碳快速,导致失活。

最新发展:向铂中添加次要金属(锡、铟、镓)被发现可以提高乙烯选择性并抑制积碳形成。该研究还调查了粒子大小和成分对催化剂性能的影响。

潜在优势:铂基催化剂对乙烷脱氢具有高活性。当用次要金属改性时,它们可以获得更好的选择性和稳定性。

工业应用:虽然没有明确说明,但对改进铂基催化剂的关注表明它们与乙烷脱氢的工业应用相关。

该文献没有提供关于CrOx、镓、铟、钒、锌和钼氧化物等金属氧化物基催化剂的信息以供比较。因此,仅根据这篇文献无法对贵金属基催化剂和金属氧化物基催化剂进行全面比较。
