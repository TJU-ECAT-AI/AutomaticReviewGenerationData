[1] "The principal by-product of ethane dehydrogenation is hydrogen, a vital commodity that can be used for a variety of applications in a refinery [35]."

[2] "The most active catalyst for ethane dehydrogenation is platinum; however, in its pure form, it exhibits low ethene selectivity and rapid coke deposition, which contributes to catalyst deactivation [6]."

[3] "The addition of a second metal, such as tin, indium, or gallium, to platinum has been found to be effective in increasing ethene selectivity and suppressing coke formation [6,811]."

[4] "Calcined hydrotalcite, namely Mg(Al)O, was used as a support of the metal particles for its high thermal stability and moderate basicity. Previous studies have shown that Mg(Al)O suppresses thermal cracking of ethane and minimizes the formation of coke on the support [2831]."

The literature primarily focuses on platinum-based catalysts for ethane dehydrogenation, with some mention of other metal additives. It does not provide a comprehensive comparison between noble metal-based catalysts and metal oxide-based catalysts for light olefin dehydrogenation. However, based on the available information, we can discuss some aspects of platinum-based catalysts:

Composition: The main catalyst discussed is platinum, often modified with a second metal such as tin, indium, or gallium. The support used is calcined hydrotalcite (Mg(Al)O).

Effectiveness: Platinum is described as the most active catalyst for ethane dehydrogenation. However, pure platinum has low ethene selectivity and suffers from rapid coke deposition, leading to deactivation.

Recent developments: The addition of a second metal (e.g., tin) to platinum has been found to increase ethene selectivity and suppress coke formation. The study focuses on controlling particle size and composition of PtSn catalysts to optimize performance.

Advantages: Platinum-based catalysts, especially when modified with a second metal, show high activity and improved selectivity for ethene production. The main by-product is hydrogen, which is valuable for refinery applications.

Industrial applications: While not explicitly stated, the research on improving platinum-based catalysts suggests their potential for industrial use in ethane dehydrogenation.

The document does not provide sufficient information to compare these platinum-based catalysts with metal oxide-based catalysts such as CrOx, gallium, indium, vanadium, zinc, and molybdenum oxides for light olefin dehydrogenation.

该文献主要关注了用于乙烷脱氢的铂基催化剂，并提到了一些其他金属添加剂。它没有提供贵金属基催化剂和金属氧化物基催化剂在轻烯烃脱氢方面的全面比较。然而，基于可用信息，我们可以讨论铂基催化剂的一些方面：

成分：主要讨论的催化剂是铂，通常与第二种金属如锡、铟或镓进行改性。使用的载体是煅烧的水滑石（Mg(Al)O）。

有效性：铂被描述为乙烷脱氢最活跃的催化剂。然而，纯铂的乙烯选择性低，并且容易快速积碳，导致失活。

最新发展：向铂中添加第二种金属（如锡）被发现可以提高乙烯选择性并抑制积碳形成。该研究专注于控制PtSn催化剂的粒径和成分以优化性能。

优势：铂基催化剂，特别是在与第二种金属改性后，表现出高活性和改进的乙烯生产选择性。主要副产品是氢气，这对炼油厂应用很有价值。

工业应用：虽然没有明确说明，但对改进铂基催化剂的研究表明它们在乙烷脱氢工业应用中的潜力。

该文档没有提供足够的信息来比较这些铂基催化剂与CrOx、镓、铟、钒、锌和钼氧化物等金属氧化物基催化剂在轻烯烃脱氢方面的性能。
