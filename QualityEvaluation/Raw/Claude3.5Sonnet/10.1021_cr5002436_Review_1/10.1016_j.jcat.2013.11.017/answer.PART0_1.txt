[1] "The principal by-product of ethane dehydrogenation is hydrogen, a vital commodity that can be used for a variety of applications in a refinery [35]."

[2] "The most active catalyst for ethane dehydrogenation is platinum; however, in its pure form, it exhibits low ethene selectivity and rapid coke deposition, which contributes to catalyst deactivation [6]."

[3] "The addition of a second metal, such as tin, indium, or gallium, to platinum has been found to be effective in increasing ethene selectivity and suppressing coke formation [6,811]."

The literature mainly focuses on platinum-based catalysts for ethane dehydrogenation, so a comprehensive comparison with metal oxide-based catalysts is not possible based solely on this text. However, some key points about platinum-based catalysts can be discussed:

Composition: Platinum is the most active catalyst for ethane dehydrogenation. However, pure platinum exhibits low ethene selectivity and rapid coke deposition. To improve performance, a second metal such as tin, indium, or gallium is often added to platinum.

Effectiveness: The addition of a second metal to platinum increases ethene selectivity and suppresses coke formation. This improvement is attributed to both geometric and electronic effects that modify the catalyst surface and change the surface chemistry involved in ethane dehydrogenation.

Industrial applications: While not explicitly stated, the text implies that platinum-based catalysts are used industrially for ethane dehydrogenation to produce ethene, which is a key building block for chemicals and polymers.

Recent developments: The study itself represents recent developments in understanding the effects of particle size and composition on platinum-tin catalysts for ethane dehydrogenation.

Potential advantages: Platinum-based catalysts, especially when modified with a second metal, offer high activity and improved selectivity for ethene production. They also produce hydrogen as a valuable by-product, which can be used in various refinery applications.

The text does not provide information on metal oxide-based catalysts like CrOx, gallium, indium, vanadium, zinc, and molybdenum oxides, so a comparison with these catalysts cannot be made based on this literature alone.

该文献主要集中在铂基催化剂用于乙烷脱氢,因此仅基于此文本无法对金属氧化物基催化剂进行全面比较。但是,可以讨论关于铂基催化剂的一些要点:

成分:铂是乙烷脱氢最活跃的催化剂。然而,纯铂表现出低乙烯选择性和快速积碳。为了提高性能,通常会向铂中添加第二种金属,如锡、铟或镓。

有效性:向铂中添加第二种金属可以提高乙烯选择性并抑制积碳形成。这种改进归因于几何效应和电子效应,这些效应可以改变催化剂表面并改变乙烷脱氢过程中涉及的表面化学反应。

工业应用:虽然没有明确说明,但文本暗示铂基催化剂在工业上用于乙烷脱氢生产乙烯,而乙烯是化学品和聚合物的关键原料。

最新发展:该研究本身代表了在理解粒子大小和成分对铂-锡催化剂在乙烷脱氢中的影响方面的最新发展。

潜在优势:铂基催化剂,特别是当用第二种金属改性时,具有高活性和改进的乙烯生产选择性。它们还产生氢气作为有价值的副产品,可用于各种炼油厂应用。

文本没有提供关于金属氧化物基催化剂(如CrOx、镓、铟、钒、锌和钼氧化物)的信息,因此仅基于这篇文献无法与这些催化剂进行比较。
