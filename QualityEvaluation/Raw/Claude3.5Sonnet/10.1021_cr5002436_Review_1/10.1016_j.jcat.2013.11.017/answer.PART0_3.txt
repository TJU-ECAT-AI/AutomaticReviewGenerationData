[1] "The principal by-product of ethane dehydrogenation is hydrogen, a vital commodity that can be used for a variety of applications in a refinery [35]."

[2] "The most active catalyst for ethane dehydrogenation is platinum; however, in its pure form, it exhibits low ethene selectivity and rapid coke deposition, which contributes to catalyst deactivation [6]."

[3] "The addition of a second metal, such as tin, indium, or gallium, to platinum has been found to be effective in increasing ethene selectivity and suppressing coke formation [6,811]."

[4] "Calcined hydrotalcite, namely Mg(Al)O, was used as a support of the metal particles for its high thermal stability and moderate basicity. Previous studies have shown that Mg(Al)O suppresses thermal cracking of ethane and minimizes the formation of coke on the support [2831]."

The literature primarily focuses on platinum-based catalysts for ethane dehydrogenation, particularly PtSn catalysts supported on Mg(Al)O. It does not provide a comprehensive comparison with metal oxide-based catalysts. However, some insights can be drawn:

1. Composition: The main noble metal-based catalyst discussed is platinum, often promoted with tin. The support used is Mg(Al)O, a calcined hydrotalcite.

2. Effectiveness: Platinum is described as the most active catalyst for ethane dehydrogenation. However, pure platinum suffers from low ethene selectivity and rapid coke deposition. The addition of tin to platinum increases ethene selectivity and suppresses coke formation.

3. Industrial applications: The paper doesn't directly discuss industrial applications, but mentions that ethane dehydrogenation is an attractive alternative to steam cracking of naphtha for ethene production.

4. Recent developments: The study focuses on controlling the size and composition of PtSn nanoparticles to optimize catalyst performance.

5. Potential advantages: Noble metal catalysts, particularly when promoted (e.g., PtSn), offer high activity and selectivity. The Mg(Al)O support provides thermal stability and helps minimize coke formation.

The paper doesn't provide information on metal oxide-based catalysts like CrOx, gallium, indium, vanadium, zinc, and molybdenum oxides for comparison. To fully answer the question, additional sources would be needed to discuss these other catalyst types.

该文献主要关注了乙烷脱氢反应中的铂基催化剂，特别是负载在Mg(Al)O上的PtSn催化剂。它没有提供与金属氧化物基催化剂的全面比较。然而，我们可以得出一些见解：

1. 组成：讨论的主要贵金属基催化剂是铂，通常用锡进行促进。使用的载体是Mg(Al)O，一种煅烧的水滑石。

2. 有效性：铂被描述为乙烷脱氢最活跃的催化剂。然而，纯铂存在乙烯选择性低和快速积碳的问题。向铂中添加锡可以提高乙烯选择性并抑制积碳形成。

3. 工业应用：该论文没有直接讨论工业应用，但提到乙烷脱氢是生产乙烯的蒸汽裂解石脑油的有吸引力的替代方案。

4. 最新发展：该研究侧重于控制PtSn纳米粒子的尺寸和组成，以优化催化剂性能。

5. 潜在优势：贵金属催化剂，特别是在促进后（如PtSn），具有高活性和选择性。Mg(Al)O载体提供了热稳定性，并有助于最小化积碳形成。

该论文没有提供关于CrOx、镓、铟、钒、锌和钼氧化物等金属氧化物基催化剂的信息以供比较。要全面回答这个问题，需要额外的资料来讨论这些其他类型的催化剂。
