          [1] "The principal by-product of ethane dehydrogenation is hydrogen, a vital commodity that can be used for a variety of applications in a refinery"

[2] "The most active catalyst for ethane dehydrogenation is platinum; however, in its pure form, it exhibits low ethene selectivity and rapid coke deposition, which contributes to catalyst deactivation"

[3] "The addition of a second metal, such as tin, indium, or gallium, to platinum has been found to be effective in increasing ethene selectivity and suppressing coke formation"

[4] "Both geometric and electronic effects of the second metals have been proposed to explain their roles in modifying the catalyst surface and changing the surface chemistry involved in ethane dehydrogenation"

[5] "Calcined hydrotalcite, namely Mg(Al)O, was used as a support of the metal particles for its high thermal stability and moderate basicity. Previous studies have shown that Mg(Al)O suppresses thermal cracking of ethane and minimizes the formation of coke on the support"

[6] "A synthetic method was employed to make PtSn particles of uniform size, which are then loaded onto a calcined hydrotalcite (Mg(Al)O) support."

          The literature primarily focuses on platinum-based catalysts for ethane dehydrogenation, particularly platinum-tin (PtSn) bimetallic catalysts. It does not provide a comprehensive comparison with metal oxide-based catalysts. However, based on the information provided, we can discuss some aspects of platinum-based catalysts:

1. Composition: The catalysts discussed are primarily platinum-based, often modified with a second metal such as tin, indium, or gallium. The specific focus is on PtSn nanoparticles supported on Mg(Al)O (calcined hydrotalcite).

2. Effectiveness: Platinum is described as the most active catalyst for ethane dehydrogenation. However, pure platinum has low ethene selectivity and suffers from rapid coke deposition, leading to deactivation. The addition of a second metal, particularly tin, improves ethene selectivity and suppresses coke formation.

3. Recent developments: The study focuses on controlling the size and composition of PtSn nanoparticles to optimize catalyst performance. A synthetic method was developed to create uniform-sized PtSn particles, which were then supported on calcined hydrotalcite (Mg(Al)O).

4. Potential advantages: The PtSn catalysts show improved selectivity to ethene and reduced coke formation compared to pure platinum catalysts. The Mg(Al)O support contributes to suppressing thermal cracking of ethane and minimizing coke formation on the support. Both geometric and electronic effects of the second metals modify the catalyst surface and change the surface chemistry involved in ethane dehydrogenation.

5. Industrial applications: While not explicitly discussed, the production of ethene from ethane dehydrogenation is mentioned as an attractive alternative to steam cracking of naphtha for producing this key chemical building block. The main by-product, hydrogen, is noted as a valuable commodity for various refinery applications.

The document does not provide information on metal oxide-based catalysts such as CrOx, gallium, indium, vanadium, zinc, and molybdenum oxides for comparison. Therefore, a comprehensive comparison between noble metal-based and metal oxide-based catalysts cannot be made based solely on this literature.

          这篇文献主要集中讨论了用于乙烷脱氢的铂基催化剂，特别是铂-锡(PtSn)双金属催化剂。它没有提供与金属氧化物基催化剂的全面比较。然而，根据提供的信息，我们可以讨论铂基催化剂的一些方面：

1. 成分：讨论的催化剂主要是铂基的，通常用第二种金属如锡、铟或镓进行改性。特别关注的是负载在Mg(Al)O（煅烧的水滑石）上的PtSn纳米粒子。

2. 有效性：铂被描述为乙烷脱氢最活跃的催化剂。然而，纯铂的乙烯选择性低，并且会快速沉积焦炭，导致失活。添加第二种金属，特别是锡，可以提高乙烯选择性并抑制焦炭形成。

3. 最新发展：研究着重于控制PtSn纳米粒子的尺寸和成分，以优化催化剂性能。开发了一种合成方法来制造尺寸均匀的PtSn粒子，然后将其负载在煅烧的水滑石(Mg(Al)O)上。

4. 潜在优势：与纯铂催化剂相比，PtSn催化剂显示出更高的乙烯选择性和更少的焦炭形成。Mg(Al)O载体有助于抑制乙烷的热裂解和最小化载体上的焦炭形成。第二种金属的几何和电子效应改变了催化剂表面并改变了乙烷脱氢过程中涉及的表面化学反应。

5. 工业应用：虽然没有明确讨论，但提到了乙烷脱氢生产乙烯是石脑油蒸汽裂解生产这种关键化学建筑块的一种有吸引力的替代方法。主要副产品氢气被指出是炼油厂各种应用的有价值的商品。

文献没有提供关于金属氧化物基催化剂（如CrOx、镓、铟、钒、锌和钼氧化物）的信息进行比较。因此，仅基于这篇文献无法对贵金属基和金属氧化物基催化剂进行全面比较。
