[1] "Ren- nard and Free1 [5] have shown that platinum supported on magnesium alu- minate is more resistant to sir&ring due to regeneration by oxidative proce- dures than the Pt/Al,O, and Pt/SiO, systems."

[2] "In the search for improved properties of dehydrogenation catalysts, great interest has been focused on spine1 type structures like magnesium and zinc aluminates [l-5]."

[3] "The main characteristics of those solids are hydrophobicity, high mechanical resistance and very low surface acidity, which are well suited to perform in the severe conditions imposed by dehydrogenation reactions of light alkanes [ 31]. Those properties make them interesting as carriers for noble metals to substitute the more traditional Cr203/A1203 catalysts [ 2,4]."

The literature provides limited information to fully compare and contrast noble metal-based catalysts (particularly platinum) and metal oxide-based catalysts for light olefin dehydrogenation. However, some relevant points can be extracted:

1. Composition: The study focuses on platinum supported on zinc aluminate (Pt/ZnAl2O4) catalysts. It mentions that traditional catalysts use Cr2O3/Al2O3.

2. Effectiveness: Platinum supported on magnesium aluminate is shown to be more resistant to sintering during oxidative regeneration compared to Pt/Al2O3 and Pt/SiO2 systems.

3. Industrial applications: The catalysts are used for dehydrogenation reactions of light alkanes, specifically mentioning isobutane dehydrogenation in this study.

4. Recent developments: The use of spinel-type structures like magnesium and zinc aluminates as supports for noble metals is presented as an area of interest for improved dehydrogenation catalysts.

5. Potential advantages: Spinel-type supports offer benefits such as hydrophobicity, high mechanical resistance, and very low surface acidity. These properties make them suitable for the severe conditions of dehydrogenation reactions and potentially advantageous as carriers for noble metals compared to traditional Cr2O3/Al2O3 catalysts.

The document does not provide detailed information on other metal oxide-based catalysts such as gallium, indium, vanadium, zinc, and molybdenum oxides for comparison.

该文献提供的信息有限，无法全面比较和对比用于轻质烯烃脱氢的贵金属基催化剂（特别是铂）和金属氧化物基催化剂。然而，可以提取一些相关要点：

1. 组成：研究重点关注锌铝尖晶石（ZnAl2O4）负载的铂催化剂。文中提到传统催化剂使用Cr2O3/Al2O3。

2. 有效性：与Pt/Al2O3和Pt/SiO2系统相比，镁铝尖晶石负载的铂在氧化再生过程中表现出更强的抗烧结能力。

3. 工业应用：这些催化剂用于轻质烷烃的脱氢反应，该研究特别提到了异丁烷脱氢。

4. 近期发展：使用镁铝尖晶石和锌铝尖晶石等尖晶石型结构作为贵金属载体是改进脱氢催化剂的一个研究重点。

5. 潜在优势：尖晶石型载体具有疏水性、高机械强度和极低表面酸度等优点。这些特性使它们适合于脱氢反应的苛刻条件，并可能比传统的Cr2O3/Al2O3催化剂在作为贵金属载体方面更具优势。

文档没有提供其他金属氧化物基催化剂（如镓、铟、钒、锌和钼氧化物）的详细信息以供比较。
