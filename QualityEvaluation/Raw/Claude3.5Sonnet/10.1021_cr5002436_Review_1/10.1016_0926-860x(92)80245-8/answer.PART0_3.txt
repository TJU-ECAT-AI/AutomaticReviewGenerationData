[1] "In the search for improved properties of dehydrogenation catalysts, great interest has been focused on spine1 type structures like magnesium and zinc aluminates [l-5]."

[2] "The main characteristics of those solids are hydrophobicity, high mechanical resistance and very low surface acidity, which are well suited to perform in the severe conditions imposed by dehydrogenation reactions of light alkanes [ 31]."

[3] "Those properties make them interesting as carriers for noble metals to substitute the more traditional Cr203/A1203 catalysts [ 2,4]."

[4] "Rennard and Free1 [5] have shown that platinum supported on magnesium aluminate is more resistant to sir&ring due to regeneration by oxidative procedures than the Pt/Al,O, and Pt/SiO, systems."

The literature does not provide a comprehensive comparison between noble metal-based catalysts and metal oxide-based catalysts for light olefin dehydrogenation. However, it does offer some insights into platinum-based catalysts supported on zinc aluminate for dehydrogenation reactions:

1. Composition: The study focuses on platinum supported on zinc aluminate (Pt/ZnAl2O4) catalysts.

2. Effectiveness: Platinum supported on zinc aluminate shows promising properties for dehydrogenation reactions, including hydrophobicity, high mechanical resistance, and very low surface acidity.

3. Industrial applications: These catalysts are being investigated as potential replacements for traditional Cr2O3/Al2O3 catalysts in light alkane dehydrogenation.

4. Recent developments: The study explores the metal-support interactions and catalytic properties of Pt/ZnAl2O4 catalysts with varying platinum contents.

5. Potential advantages: Platinum supported on magnesium aluminate (a similar spinel structure) has been shown to be more resistant to sintering during oxidative regeneration compared to Pt/Al2O3 and Pt/SiO2 systems.

The literature does not provide information on other metal oxide-based catalysts such as gallium, indium, vanadium, zinc, and molybdenum oxides for comparison.

该文献并未提供贵金属基催化剂和金属氧化物基催化剂在轻质烯烃脱氢方面的全面比较。但是，它确实提供了一些关于铂基催化剂在锌铝尖晶石上用于脱氢反应的见解：

1. 组成：研究重点关注负载在锌铝尖晶石上的铂（Pt/ZnAl2O4）催化剂。

2. 有效性：负载在锌铝尖晶石上的铂显示出适用于脱氢反应的良好性能，包括疏水性、高机械强度和很低的表面酸性。

3. 工业应用：这些催化剂正在被研究作为传统Cr2O3/Al2O3催化剂在轻烷烃脱氢中的潜在替代品。

4. 最新发展：该研究探讨了不同铂含量的Pt/ZnAl2O4催化剂的金属-载体相互作用和催化性能。

5. 潜在优势：负载在镁铝尖晶石上的铂（一种类似的尖晶石结构）在氧化再生过程中表现出比Pt/Al2O3和Pt/SiO2系统更强的抗烧结能力。

该文献没有提供其他金属氧化物基催化剂（如镓、铟、钒、锌和钼氧化物）的相关信息以进行比较。
