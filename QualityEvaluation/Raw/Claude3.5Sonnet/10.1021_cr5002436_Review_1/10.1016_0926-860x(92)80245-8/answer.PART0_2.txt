[1] "In the search for improved properties of dehydrogenation catalysts, great interest has been focused on spine1 type structures like magnesium and zinc aluminates [l-5]."

[2] "The main characteristics of those solids are hydrophobicity, high mechanical resistance and very low surface acidity, which are well suited to perform in the severe conditions imposed by dehydrogenation reactions of light alkanes [3]."

[3] "Those properties make them interesting as carriers for noble metals to substitute the more traditional Cr203/A1203 catalysts [2,4]."

[4] "Rennard and Free1 [5] have shown that platinum supported on magnesium aluminate is more resistant to sir&ring due to regeneration by oxidative procedures than the Pt/Al,O, and Pt/SiO, systems."

The literature does not provide a comprehensive comparison of noble metal-based catalysts and metal oxide-based catalysts for light olefin dehydrogenation. However, it does offer some insights into platinum-based catalysts supported on zinc aluminate:

1. Composition: The study focuses on Pt/ZnAl2O4 catalysts with platinum contents ranging from 0.1 to 1.17 wt-%.

2. Effectiveness: Platinum supported on zinc aluminate shows promising properties for dehydrogenation reactions, including hydrophobicity, high mechanical resistance, and very low surface acidity.

3. Industrial applications: These catalysts are being investigated as potential replacements for traditional Cr2O3/Al2O3 catalysts in light alkane dehydrogenation reactions.

4. Recent developments: The study explores the metal-support interactions and catalytic behavior of Pt/ZnAl2O4 catalysts using various characterization techniques.

5. Potential advantages: Platinum supported on magnesium aluminate (a similar spinel structure) has been shown to be more resistant to sintering during oxidative regeneration compared to Pt/Al2O3 and Pt/SiO2 systems.

The document does not provide information on other metal oxide-based catalysts such as gallium, indium, vanadium, zinc, and molybdenum oxides for comparison.

该文献没有提供贵金属基催化剂和金属氧化物基催化剂在轻烯烃脱氢方面的全面比较。但是，它确实提供了一些关于锌铝酸盐负载铂催化剂的见解：

1. 组成：研究重点是铂含量在0.1至1.17 wt-%范围内的Pt/ZnAl2O4催化剂。

2. 有效性：锌铝酸盐负载铂催化剂在脱氢反应中显示出有前景的性能，包括疏水性、高机械强度和极低的表面酸度。

3. 工业应用：这些催化剂正在被研究作为轻烷烃脱氢反应中传统Cr2O3/Al2O3催化剂的潜在替代品。

4. 最新发展：该研究使用各种表征技术探究了Pt/ZnAl2O4催化剂的金属-载体相互作用和催化行为。

5. 潜在优势：镁铝酸盐负载铂（类似的尖晶石结构）在氧化再生过程中已被证明比Pt/Al2O3和Pt/SiO2系统更能抵抗烧结。

该文献没有提供其他金属氧化物基催化剂（如镓、铟、钒、锌和钼氧化物）的信息以供比较。
