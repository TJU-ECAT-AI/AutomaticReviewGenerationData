          [1] "Two classes of catalysts are used in commercial dehydrogenation processes, supported platinumtin catalysts and chromium oxide supported on alumina."

[2] "Platinum, usually promoted with tin, is used as a dehydrogenation catalyst in several industrial processes."

[3] "The promotion of Pt by Sn has been reported to have several advantages: it improves catalytic activity and dehydrogenation selectivity, prevents Pt sintering, and decreases deactivation due to coke formation"

[4] "Pt,Sn/Mg(Al)O catalysts have previously been found to possess superior activity and stability as a propane dehydrogenation catalyst compared to conventional Pt,Sn/Al2O3 catalysts."

[5] "A higher selectivity toward ethene, as well as a higher stability, is observed for the Pt,Sn/Mg(Al)O catalysts compared to the Pt/Mg(Al)O catalyst."

[6] "Nonacidic supports have been reported to result in less cracking and polymerization and enhanced stability in dehydrogenation reactions."

[7] "Sn covers the steps, corners, edges, and defects of the Pt particles, thus developing simultaneously a geometric and a chemical effect on the surface properties of the exposed Pt atoms."

          The literature primarily focuses on platinum-based catalysts, particularly platinum-tin catalysts, for light olefin dehydrogenation. It provides limited information on metal oxide-based catalysts.

Composition:
- Noble metal-based catalysts: Typically consist of platinum promoted with tin, supported on materials like Mg(Al)O or Al2O3.
- Metal oxide-based catalysts: Only chromium oxide supported on alumina is mentioned.

Effectiveness:
- Pt-Sn catalysts show superior activity, selectivity, and stability compared to unpromoted Pt catalysts.
- Pt,Sn/Mg(Al)O catalysts demonstrate higher selectivity towards ethene and better stability compared to Pt/Mg(Al)O and conventional Pt,Sn/Al2O3 catalysts.

Industrial applications:
- Platinum-tin catalysts are used in several commercial dehydrogenation processes.
- Chromium oxide supported on alumina is also used commercially, but specific applications are not detailed.

Recent developments:
- Use of non-acidic supports like Mg(Al)O to enhance stability and reduce unwanted side reactions.
- Improved understanding of Sn's role in covering low-coordinated Pt sites, leading to better performance.

Potential advantages of Pt-Sn catalysts:
- Improved catalytic activity and dehydrogenation selectivity
- Prevention of Pt sintering
- Decreased deactivation due to coke formation
- Enhanced stability with non-acidic supports
- Reduced cracking and polymerization reactions

The literature does not provide sufficient information to comprehensively compare noble metal-based catalysts with various metal oxide-based catalysts like gallium, indium, vanadium, zinc, and molybdenum oxides.

          该文献主要关注铂基催化剂，特别是铂-锡催化剂，用于轻烯烃脱氢。它提供了有限的金属氧化物基催化剂信息。

组成：
- 贵金属基催化剂：通常由铂和锡组成，负载在Mg(Al)O或Al2O3等材料上。
- 金属氧化物基催化剂：仅提到了负载在氧化铝上的氧化铬。

有效性：
- Pt-Sn催化剂与未改性的Pt催化剂相比，显示出更高的活性、选择性和稳定性。
- Pt,Sn/Mg(Al)O催化剂与Pt/Mg(Al)O和传统Pt,Sn/Al2O3催化剂相比，对乙烯表现出更高的选择性和更好的稳定性。

工业应用：
- 铂-锡催化剂在几种商业脱氢工艺中使用。
- 负载在氧化铝上的氧化铬也在商业上使用，但未详细说明具体应用。

最新发展：
- 使用Mg(Al)O等非酸性载体来提高稳定性并减少不需要的副反应。
- 对Sn在覆盖低配位Pt位点中的作用有了更好的理解，从而提高了性能。

Pt-Sn催化剂的潜在优势：
- 提高催化活性和脱氢选择性
- 防止Pt烧结
- 减少由于积碳造成的失活
- 非酸性载体提高稳定性
- 减少裂解和聚合反应

文献没有提供足够的信息来全面比较贵金属基催化剂与各种金属氧化物基催化剂，如镓、铟、钒、锌和钼氧化物。
