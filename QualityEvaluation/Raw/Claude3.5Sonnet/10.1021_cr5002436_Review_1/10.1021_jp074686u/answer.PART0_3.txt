[1] "Two classes of catalysts are used in commercial dehydrogenation processes, supported platinumtin catalysts and chromium oxide supported on alumina."

[2] "Platinum, usually promoted with tin, is used as a dehydrogenation catalyst in several industrial processes."

[3] "The promotion of Pt by Sn has been reported to have several advantages: it improves catalytic activity and dehydrogenation selectivity, prevents Pt sintering, and decreases deactivation due to coke formation"

[4] "Pt,Sn/Mg(Al)O catalysts have previously been found to possess superior activity and stability as a propane dehydrogenation catalyst compared to conventional Pt,Sn/Al2O3 catalysts."

[5] "A higher selectivity toward ethene, as well as a higher stability, is observed for the Pt,Sn/Mg(Al)O catalysts compared to the Pt/Mg(Al)O catalyst."

The literature primarily focuses on platinum-based catalysts for light olefin dehydrogenation, particularly platinum-tin catalysts. It does not provide comprehensive information on metal oxide-based catalysts like CrOx, gallium, indium, vanadium, zinc, and molybdenum oxides. However, some comparisons can be made based on the available information:

Composition: 
- Noble metal-based catalysts: Typically consist of platinum promoted with tin, supported on materials like Mg(Al)O or Al2O3.
- Metal oxide-based catalysts: The literature only mentions chromium oxide supported on alumina.

Effectiveness:
- Pt-Sn catalysts are reported to have superior activity and stability compared to conventional catalysts.
- Pt-Sn/Mg(Al)O catalysts show higher selectivity towards ethene and better stability compared to Pt/Mg(Al)O catalysts.

Industrial applications:
- Platinum-tin catalysts are used in several commercial dehydrogenation processes.
- Chromium oxide supported on alumina is also used commercially, but specific applications are not detailed.

Recent developments:
- The study focuses on the development and characterization of Pt-Sn/Mg(Al)O catalysts, showing improvements in activity, selectivity, and stability.

Potential advantages:
- Pt-Sn catalysts offer improved catalytic activity, higher dehydrogenation selectivity, prevention of Pt sintering, and decreased deactivation due to coke formation.

The literature does not provide enough information to make a comprehensive comparison between noble metal-based and metal oxide-based catalysts beyond these points.

该文献主要集中于铂基催化剂在轻烯烃脱氢中的应用，特别是铂-锡催化剂。它没有提供关于金属氧化物基催化剂（如CrOx、镓、铟、钒、锌和钼氧化物）的全面信息。但是，根据可用信息可以进行一些比较：

成分：
- 贵金属基催化剂：通常由铂和锡组成，负载在Mg(Al)O或Al2O3等材料上。
- 金属氧化物基催化剂：文献仅提到了负载在氧化铝上的氧化铬。

有效性：
- 据报道，Pt-Sn催化剂与传统催化剂相比具有更高的活性和稳定性。
- Pt-Sn/Mg(Al)O催化剂与Pt/Mg(Al)O催化剂相比，显示出更高的乙烯选择性和更好的稳定性。

工业应用：
- 铂-锡催化剂在几种商业脱氢工艺中使用。
- 负载在氧化铝上的氧化铬也在商业上使用，但未详细说明具体应用。

最新发展：
- 该研究主要集中在Pt-Sn/Mg(Al)O催化剂的开发和表征上，显示出活性、选择性和稳定性的改进。

潜在优势：
- Pt-Sn催化剂提供了改进的催化活性、更高的脱氢选择性、防止Pt烧结、以及由于焦炭形成导致的失活减少。

文献没有提供足够的信息来对贵金属基和金属氧化物基催化剂进行超出这些要点的全面比较。
