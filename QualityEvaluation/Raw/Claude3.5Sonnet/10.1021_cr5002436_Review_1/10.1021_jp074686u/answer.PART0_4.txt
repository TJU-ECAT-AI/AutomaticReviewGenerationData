The literature primarily discusses platinum-based catalysts for light olefin dehydrogenation, with limited mention of other metal oxide catalysts. However, some comparisons can be made:

Composition: Platinum-based catalysts typically consist of platinum promoted with tin, supported on materials like Mg(Al)O or Al2O3. The main metal oxide catalyst mentioned is chromium oxide supported on alumina.

Effectiveness: Pt-Sn catalysts are reported to have several advantages, including improved catalytic activity, selectivity, and stability compared to unpromoted Pt catalysts. Pt,Sn/Mg(Al)O catalysts specifically show superior activity and stability compared to conventional Pt,Sn/Al2O3 catalysts for propane dehydrogenation.

Industrial applications: Both Pt-Sn and chromium oxide catalysts are used in commercial dehydrogenation processes. Platinum-based catalysts are used in several industrial processes, suggesting widespread application.

Recent developments: The literature discusses improvements in Pt-Sn catalysts, particularly the use of non-acidic supports like Mg(Al)O to enhance stability and reduce unwanted side reactions.

Potential advantages: Pt-Sn catalysts show advantages in terms of activity, selectivity, and stability. The promotion of Pt with Sn improves dehydrogenation selectivity, prevents Pt sintering, and decreases deactivation due to coke formation. Non-acidic supports further enhance stability and reduce cracking and polymerization reactions.

The literature does not provide sufficient information to compare Pt-based catalysts with other metal oxide catalysts like gallium, indium, vanadium, zinc, and molybdenum oxides.

该文献主要讨论了用于轻烯烃脱氢的铂基催化剂，对其他金属氧化物催化剂的提及有限。然而，我们可以做出一些比较：

组成：铂基催化剂通常由铂和锡组成，负载在Mg(Al)O或Al2O3等材料上。文中提到的主要金属氧化物催化剂是负载在氧化铝上的氧化铬。

效果：据报道，Pt-Sn催化剂具有多项优势，包括与未改性的Pt催化剂相比，具有更好的催化活性、选择性和稳定性。特别是Pt,Sn/Mg(Al)O催化剂在丙烷脱氢反应中显示出比传统Pt,Sn/Al2O3催化剂更优越的活性和稳定性。

工业应用：Pt-Sn和氧化铬催化剂都用于商业脱氢过程。铂基催化剂在多个工业过程中使用，表明其应用广泛。

最新发展：文献讨论了Pt-Sn催化剂的改进，特别是使用Mg(Al)O等非酸性载体来提高稳定性并减少不需要的副反应。

潜在优势：Pt-Sn催化剂在活性、选择性和稳定性方面显示出优势。用Sn改性Pt可以提高脱氢选择性，防止Pt烧结，并减少由于积碳造成的失活。非酸性载体进一步增强了稳定性，减少了裂解和聚合反应。

该文献没有提供足够的信息来比较铂基催化剂与其他金属氧化物催化剂，如镓、铟、钒、锌和钼氧化物。
