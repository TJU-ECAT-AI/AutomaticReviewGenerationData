The literature primarily focuses on platinum-based catalysts, particularly platinum-tin catalysts, for light alkane dehydrogenation. It does not provide detailed information on metal oxide-based catalysts beyond mentioning chromium oxide supported on alumina as one of the two main classes of commercial dehydrogenation catalysts.

For platinum-based catalysts:

Composition: Platinum is typically promoted with tin and supported on materials like Mg(Al)O.

Effectiveness: Pt-Sn catalysts show high selectivity towards alkenes and improved stability compared to unpromoted Pt catalysts. The addition of Sn improves catalytic activity, dehydrogenation selectivity, prevents Pt sintering, and reduces coke formation.

Industrial applications: Pt-Sn catalysts are used in several industrial processes for light alkane dehydrogenation.

Recent developments: The study reveals that Sn covers low-coordinated Pt sites (steps, corners, edges, defects), which leads to higher selectivity towards ethene and improved catalyst stability.

Potential advantages: Pt-Sn catalysts offer high selectivity, stability, and resistance to coking, making them suitable for industrial-scale dehydrogenation processes.

The document does not provide sufficient information to compare Pt-based catalysts with metal oxide catalysts like CrOx, gallium, indium, vanadium, zinc, and molybdenum oxides in terms of their compositions, effectiveness, industrial applications, or recent developments.

该文献主要关注铂基催化剂，特别是铂-锡催化剂，用于轻烷烃脱氢。除了提到铬氧化物负载在氧化铝上是两种主要商业脱氢催化剂之一外，文献并未提供有关金属氧化物基催化剂的详细信息。

对于铂基催化剂：

组成：铂通常与锡一起促进，并负载在如Mg(Al)O等材料上。

有效性：Pt-Sn催化剂对烯烃表现出高选择性，并且与未促进的Pt催化剂相比稳定性更好。添加Sn可以提高催化活性、脱氢选择性，防止Pt烧结，并减少积碳形成。

工业应用：Pt-Sn催化剂在几个工业过程中用于轻烷烃脱氢。

最新发展：研究表明，Sn覆盖了低配位的Pt位点（台阶、角、边缘、缺陷），这导致了对乙烯的选择性更高，催化剂稳定性更好。

潜在优势：Pt-Sn催化剂具有高选择性、稳定性和抗积碳性，使其适用于工业规模的脱氢过程。

该文档没有提供足够的信息来比较Pt基催化剂与金属氧化物催化剂（如CrOx、镓、铟、钒、锌和钼氧化物）在组成、有效性、工业应用或最新发展方面的差异。
