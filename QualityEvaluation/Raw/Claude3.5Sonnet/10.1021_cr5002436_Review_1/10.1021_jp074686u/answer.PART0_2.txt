[1] "Two classes of catalysts are used in commercial dehydrogenation processes, supported platinumtin catalysts and chromium oxide supported on alumina."

[2] "Platinum, usually promoted with tin, is used as a dehydrogenation catalyst in several industrial processes."

[3] "The promotion of Pt by Sn has been reported to have several advantages: it improves catalytic activity and dehydrogenation selectivity, prevents Pt sintering, and decreases deactivation due to coke formation"

[4] "Pt,Sn/Mg(Al)O catalysts have previously been found to possess superior activity and stability as a propane dehydrogenation catalyst compared to conventional Pt,Sn/Al2O3 catalysts."

[5] "A higher selectivity toward ethene, as well as a higher stability, is observed for the Pt,Sn/Mg(Al)O catalysts compared to the Pt/Mg(Al)O catalyst."

The literature primarily focuses on platinum-based catalysts, particularly those promoted with tin, for light olefin dehydrogenation. It does not provide a comprehensive comparison with metal oxide-based catalysts.

Platinum-based catalysts:
Composition: Typically supported platinum-tin catalysts, often on Mg(Al)O or Al2O3 supports.
Effectiveness: Highly effective for dehydrogenation reactions, with improved activity and selectivity when promoted with tin.
Industrial applications: Used in several commercial dehydrogenation processes.
Recent developments: Pt,Sn supported on Mg(Al)O shows superior activity and stability compared to conventional Pt,Sn/Al2O3 catalysts.
Advantages: High selectivity towards olefins, improved stability, resistance to sintering, and reduced coke formation.

Metal oxide-based catalysts:
The document only mentions chromium oxide supported on alumina as another class of commercial dehydrogenation catalysts. It does not provide information on gallium, indium, vanadium, zinc, or molybdenum oxides for this application.

Overall, the literature suggests that platinum-tin catalysts, particularly those supported on Mg(Al)O, offer significant advantages in terms of activity, selectivity, and stability for light olefin dehydrogenation. However, a comprehensive comparison with various metal oxide-based catalysts is not possible based on the given information.

该文献主要关注以铂为基础的催化剂，特别是那些用锡促进的催化剂，用于轻质烯烃脱氢。它没有提供与金属氧化物基催化剂的全面比较。

铂基催化剂：
成分：通常是铂-锡支持型催化剂，常见的载体是Mg(Al)O或Al2O3。
有效性：对脱氢反应高度有效，用锡促进后活性和选择性得到改善。
工业应用：用于多个商业脱氢工艺。
最新发展：以Mg(Al)O为载体的Pt,Sn催化剂比传统的Pt,Sn/Al2O3催化剂表现出更优越的活性和稳定性。
优势：对烯烃的高选择性，改善的稳定性，抗烧结性，以及减少积碳形成。

金属氧化物基催化剂：
文档仅提到以氧化铝为载体的氧化铬是另一类商业脱氢催化剂。它没有提供关于镓、铟、钒、锌或钼氧化物在这一应用中的信息。

总的来说，文献表明，铂-锡催化剂，特别是以Mg(Al)O为载体的催化剂，在轻质烯烃脱氢方面在活性、选择性和稳定性方面提供了显著的优势。然而，基于给定的信息，无法与各种金属氧化物基催化剂进行全面比较。
