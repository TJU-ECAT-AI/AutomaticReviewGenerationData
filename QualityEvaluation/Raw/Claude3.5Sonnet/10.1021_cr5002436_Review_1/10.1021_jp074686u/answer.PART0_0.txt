[1] "Two classes of catalysts are used in commercial dehydrogenation processes, supported platinumtin catalysts and chromium oxide supported on alumina."

[2] "Platinum, usually promoted with tin, is used as a dehydrogenation catalyst in several industrial processes."

[3] "The promotion of Pt by Sn has been reported to have several advantages: it improves catalytic activity and dehydrogenation selectivity, prevents Pt sintering, and decreases deactivation due to coke formation"

[4] "Sn covers the steps, corners, edges, and defects of the Pt particles, thus developing simultaneously a geometric and a chemical effect on the surface properties of the exposed Pt atoms."

[5] "A higher selectivity toward ethene, as well as a higher stability, is observed for the Pt,Sn/Mg(Al)O catalysts compared to the Pt/Mg(Al)O catalyst."

The literature primarily focuses on platinum-based catalysts, particularly platinum-tin catalysts, for light olefin dehydrogenation. It does not provide detailed information on metal oxide-based catalysts like CrOx, gallium, indium, vanadium, zinc, and molybdenum oxides.

For platinum-based catalysts:

Composition: Platinum is typically promoted with tin and supported on materials like Mg(Al)O.

Effectiveness: Pt-Sn catalysts show higher selectivity towards ethene and better stability compared to unpromoted Pt catalysts. The addition of Sn improves catalytic activity, dehydrogenation selectivity, prevents Pt sintering, and decreases coke formation.

Industrial applications: Platinum-tin catalysts are used in several commercial dehydrogenation processes.

Recent developments: The study shows that Sn covers the steps, corners, edges, and defects of Pt particles, creating both geometric and chemical effects on the surface properties of exposed Pt atoms. This arrangement leads to improved catalyst performance.

Potential advantages: Pt-Sn catalysts offer higher selectivity, better stability, and improved resistance to deactivation compared to unpromoted Pt catalysts.

For metal oxide-based catalysts, the document only mentions that chromium oxide supported on alumina is used in commercial dehydrogenation processes. It does not provide information on the other metal oxides listed in the question.

The literature does not allow for a comprehensive comparison between noble metal-based and metal oxide-based catalysts for light olefin dehydrogenation.

该文献主要关注铂基催化剂，特别是铂-锡催化剂，用于轻烯烃脱氢。它没有提供关于金属氧化物基催化剂（如CrOx、镓、铟、钒、锌和钼氧化物）的详细信息。

对于铂基催化剂：

组成：铂通常与锡一起使用，并负载在Mg(Al)O等材料上。

效率：与未经改性的铂催化剂相比，铂-锡催化剂表现出更高的乙烯选择性和更好的稳定性。添加锡可以提高催化活性、脱氢选择性，防止铂烧结，并减少积碳形成。

工业应用：铂-锡催化剂在几个商业脱氢过程中得到应用。

最新发展：研究表明，锡覆盖了铂颗粒的台阶、边角和缺陷，对暴露的铂原子表面性质产生了几何和化学双重效应。这种排列导致了催化剂性能的改善。

潜在优势：与未经改性的铂催化剂相比，铂-锡催化剂具有更高的选择性、更好的稳定性和更强的抗失活能力。

对于金属氧化物基催化剂，文献只提到氧化铬负载在氧化铝上用于商业脱氢过程。它没有提供问题中列出的其他金属氧化物的信息。

该文献不允许对贵金属基和金属氧化物基催化剂在轻烯烃脱氢方面进行全面比较。
