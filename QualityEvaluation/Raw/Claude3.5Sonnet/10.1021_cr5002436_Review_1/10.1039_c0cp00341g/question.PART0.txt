Self-consistent periodic slab calculations based on gradient-corrected density functional theory
(DFT-GGA) have been conducted to examine the reaction network of propane dehydrogenation
over close-packed Pt(111) and stepped Pt(211) surfaces. Selective CH or CC bond cleaving is
investigated to gain a better understanding of the catalyst site requirements for propane
dehydrogenation. The energy barriers for the dehydrogenation of propane to form propylene are
calculated to be in the region of 0.650.75 eV and 0.250.35 eV on flat and stepped surfaces,
respectively. Likewise, the activation of the side reactions such as the deep dehydrogenation and
cracking of C3 derivatives depends strongly on the step density, arising from the much lower
energy barriers on Pt(211). Taking the activation energy difference between propylene
dehydrogenation and propylene desorption as the descriptor, we find that while step sites play a
crucial role in the activation of propane dehydrogenation, the selectivity towards propylene is
substantially lowered in the presence of the coordinatively unsaturated surface Pt atoms. As the
sole C3 derivative which prefers the cleavage of the CC bond to the CH bond breaking,
propyne is suggested to be the starting point for the CC bond breaking which eventually gives
rise to the formation of ethane, methane and coke. These findings provide a rational
interpretation of the recent experimental observations that smaller Pt particles containing more
step sites are much more active but less selective than larger particles in propane
dehydrogenation.

Introduction
In the past three decades, extensive efforts have been devoted
to catalytic dehydrogenation of paraffin on transition metals
for light olefin production.13 Special interest has been focused
on the catalysts for propane dehydrogenation to form propylene
because propane is easily available and there is an increasing
demand for propylene. Though several catalytic dehydro-
genation techniques such as Oleflex, Catofin, etc. have been
commercialized, there is still plenty of room to improve the
catalyst performance for longer operation cycle and higher
selectivity.
Pt and Pt-based alloys have long been known as important
catalysts in hydrogenation of olefins, and the dehydrogenation
and cracking of paraffins.48 However, the major problem
for Pt-based catalysts is the CC cleavage of long-chain
hydrocarbons, leading to coke formation.920 As a result, the
catalyst losses its activity quickly and must be regenerated
cyclically, which increases the process complexity. In the
propane dehydrogenation system, it is therefore of vital
importance to understand the reaction mechanism so as to
improve the selectivity towards propylene and suppress coke
formation
The dehydrogenation of propane involves a series of side
reactions, including deep dehydrogenation and hydrogenolysis
of propane, and produces numerous fragments ranging from
C1 to C3 species adsorbed on the catalyst surface. In order to
understand the reaction mechanism involved in the dehydro-
genation process, a large number of kinetic and spectroscopic
measurements have been performed to identify the possible
reactive intermediates on the catalyst.1,2128 In early 1982,

programmed desorption (TPD) and reflection-absorption
infrared spectroscopy (RAIRS), indicated that the allylic
species was firstly hydrogenated to propylene and then
decomposed to propylidyne (CCH2CH3) and eventually to
H2 and surface carbon. Based on the fluorescence yield near
edge spectroscopy (FYNES) experiments, propyne was found
to be adsorbed through the p system, with the methyl group
orientated up from the Pt surface plane.31 However, the
adsorbed propyne was quite active. At room temperature, it
was reported that propyne was converted to propylidyne in the
presence of hydrogen on the catalyst surface.32 The recent
theoretical calculations were consistent with their experimental
results.3036 Based on the Brnsted-Evans-Polanyi (BEP)
relationship, the activation energy can be estimated from the
reaction heat.33,35 Valca
 rcel et al.36 studied the thermo-
dynamics of the dehydrogenation of propylene on Pt(111)
through density functional theory (DFT) calculations. They
proposed
that
the
formation
of
propylidyne
was
the
most exothermic step in the dehydrogenation process. It was
therefore reasonable to assume that the barrier for the
formation of propylidyne was lower than those for the other
reactions. In addition, the subsequent dehydrogenation of
propyl towards propylene was suggested to be the rate-
determining step in propane dehydrogenation on the basis of
the reported kinetic study.27,28 However, no first-principles
calculations are hitherto conducted to investigate the detailed
reaction mechanism for propane dehydrogenation.
It has been long observed that the bond scission in hydro-
carbon conversion reactions is generally aided by corrugated
surfaces. Step sites showed much higher activity towards CH
bond and CC bond cleavage than the flat surface.37 For
example, the d-band center of edge atoms is 0.15 eV higher in
energy than that of the atoms on a flat Pd surface.38 In the past
decade, extensive studies have been focused on the dissociation
of C1 and C2 hydrocarbons on metal surfaces.3843 Vang
et al.43 performed DFT calculations and found that the
stepped Ni surface could significantly lower the barriers for
ethylene dissociation, especially for the CC bond breaking.
To date, however, no general framework has been established
for the surface structure effect on the selectivity towards
propylene and coke formation in propane dehydrogenation.
The experimental results regarding the effect of metal particle
size are available from recent years.5,44 Binder et al.44 studied
the turnover frequency (TOF) of Pd catalyst in ethylene
hydrogenation and observed that a maximum TOF occurred
for a Pd particle size of 3 nm. In the propane dehydrogenation
system, smaller particles were found to be more active for
propane
conversion
and
coke
formation
while
larger
ones showed lower activity but higher selectivity towards
propylene.5 It is well known that as the particle size is
increased, the population of the flat surface sites increases
while that of the step sites decreases. It is therefore expected
that the coke formation on Pt catalyst is mostly attributed to
the CC breaking on step sites.
In the present work, DFT calculations are employed to
investigate the successive dehydrogenation and cracking of
propane on Pt(111) and Pt(211). We focus on the dissociation
of all the C3 intermediates, and predict the possible products
for the dehydrogenation and cracking from kinetic and
thermodynamic points of view. The complex reaction network
to be investigated is summarized in Fig. 1.
The paper is organized as follows. In section 2, details of the
computational method are described, and in section 3, the
activation energies and transition states for all the dehydro-
genation and cracking steps on Pt(111) and Pt(211) are
determined so as to reveal the reaction mechanism for propane
dehydrogenation. In section 4, we conclude by discussing the
effect of the surface structure on the catalytic activity and
selectivity towards propylene. Finally, the reaction pathway
for CC bond breaking and the overall reaction scheme for
propane dehydrogenation are elucidated.

The plane-wave density functional theory calculations are
carried out with the VASP package,4547 where KohnSham
equations are solved self-consistently with the generalized

convergence. Brillouin zone sampling is performed by using

the system and the electronic occupancies are determined
according to a Methfessel-Paxton scheme50 with an energy
smearing of 0.2 eV.
A four-layer slab with a p(33) supercell is used to represent
the Pt(111) surface, achieving the coverage of adsorbates of
1/9 ML (monolayers). The equilibrium PtPt interatomic
distance is calculated to be 2.82 A
 . The successive slabs are
separated by a vacuum region as thick as 12 A
in order to
avoid periodic interactions. The MonkhorstPack k-points set
contains seven k-points in the x- and y-direction and one
k-point in the z-direction. The bottom two layers of the slab are
kept fixed to their crystal lattice positions. When studying the
reactions at steps, a (14) unit cell with 9 layers is used. The step
sites on Pt(211) are shown schematically in Fig. 2. In these
calculations, the bottom four layers are fixed. Monkhorst Pack
mesh of 421 k-points sampling in the surface Brillouin zone
are used on the stepped surface. The ground-state atomic
geometries of bulk and surfaces are obtained by minimizing
the
HellmanFeynman
forces
with
the
conjugate-gradient
algorithm until the total force on each ion is below 0.03 eV/A
 .
To determine the reaction pathways, the dimer method
implemented in VASP is used to climb up the potential energy
surface from minimum to saddle points.5153 From the initial
point, the dimer method is used to find the lowest curvature
mode that leads to the saddle point. A force tolerance of
0.03 eV/A
 is used in all the transition state searches. During
the electronic optimization, the total energy and band structure
energy are converged to an accuracy of 1107 eV/atom so as
to obtain accurate forces.
The adsorption energy (DEads) of an adsorbate (C3Hx) is
defined with respect to the gas-phase propane and the
adsorbed H. The adsorption energy is calculated according
to the following expression
DEads = (EC3Hx/surface  EC3H8(g)  Esurface)
+ (8  x)(EH/surface  Esurface)
(1)
where EC3H8, EH and Esurface are DFT total energies of
gas-phase propane, hydrogen and bare surface, respectively.
A negative DEads corresponds to an energy gain process.

Results and discussion
3.1
Adsorption of propane and propylene on Pt(111) and
Pt(211)
In recent years, the chemisorption of propane and propylene
on Pt surface has been extensively studied both experimentally
and theoretically. Wang investigated the effects of a surface
step on molecular propane adsorption on Pt(6 5 5) through
molecular dynamics simulations and found that the favored
zone for propane adsorption was near the step edge on the Pt
surface, and the unfavorable zone was the top of the surface
step on the upper terrace.25 However, propane could not be
adsorbed on the surface by binding with the Pt atoms, which
resulted in low adsorption energy. As for propylene, it had a
half-saturated double bond (C
Q
C), and could therefore be
readily adsorbed and decomposed on the Pt surface. Below the
saturated coverage, di-s mode adsorption was favored, while
further dosing of propylene led to p mode adsorption.
Valca
 rcel et al.54 performed DFT calculations to study the
chemisorption of propylene on Pt(111). It was reported that
propylene was preferentially adsorbed at the bridge site in the
di-s mode, and the binding energy was higher than that in the
p mode.
On the basis of the slab model, the chemisorption of
propane is investigated on both Pt(111) and Pt(211). On
Pt(111), propane is initially placed near the four high-symmetry
adsorption sites, atop, bridge, fcc, and hcp. The total energies
of the optimized configurations are very close, and the adsorption
energies fall within the range of 0.020.06 eV. The molecular
propane is repelled by the metal surface, drifting over the Pt
surface, as shown in Fig. 3(a). On Pt(211), geometry optimization
is performed by assigning propane at several adsorption sites
near the step edge. It is found that propane cannot bind to the
Pt atoms, and the adsorption energy is 0.04 eV. The above
results show that propane is weakly physisorbed on both
Pt(111) and Pt(211).
The LEED analysis32 indicated that propylene could be
adsorbed at the Pt surface in both the di-s and p modes. In our
calculations, the adsorption energy in the di-s mode on
Pt(111) is 0.27 eV higher than that in the p mode, which is
consistent with the results of Zaera and Chrysostomou.1,26 As
shown in Fig. 3(b), propylene is preferentially adsorbed at the
Bridge site by binding with two Pt atoms. The length of the
C
Q
C bond in the di-s mode adsorption is elongated to 1.50 A
(1.36 A
in gaseous propylene), which is close to the CC
distance of propane (1.54 A
 ). This indicates that the C

bond is weakened, due to the formation of covalent bonds
between C and Pt atoms. On the stepped surface, propylene also
favors the Bridge site on the step edge, and the optimized
structure is similar to that on the flat surface. However, the
adsorption energy is calculated to be 1.17 eV, 0.83 eV higher
than that on the flat surface, indicating that binding to the less
coordinated Pt atoms is preferred. It was reported that the
adsorption of propylene could be weakened by increasing its
coverage or in the presence of pre-adsorbed hydrogen atoms.1 It
is therefore an efficient way to promote propylene desorption by
introducing coadsorbed hydrogen atoms on Pt surfaces.
3.2
Propane dehydrogenation to form propylene
The dehydrogenation process from propane to propylene
involves at least two elementary steps. As for gaseous propane,
it is known that the energy barrier for the CH activation of
methyl group is higher than that for the activation of methylene
group (4.35 and 4.17 eV, respectively). In the catalytic system,
propane dehydrogenation to produce propylene follows two
steps: (i) the initial activation of propane occurs at both the
methyl and methylene groups which generate 1-propyl and
2-propyl, respectively; (ii) propylene is formed via b-dehydro-
genation of 1-propyl and 2-propyl. Each detached hydrogen
atom requires an empty site for accommodation. It is therefore
reasonable to expect that the coverage of hydrogen would
significantly affect the dehydrogenation activation energy.
In step (i), the energy barriers for the initial activation of
propane at both the methyl and methylene groups are
calculated to be 0.69 and 0.70 eV on Pt(111), respectively.
As shown in Fig. 4 (TS1 and TS2), propane is dehydrogenated
over the top of a Pt atom, with the detached H atom
positioned at the bridge site by elongating the CH bond.
The remaining 1-propyl is located at the most stable atop site.
The activated CH bond in the transition state (TS) is
stretched compared to the CH bond length in the propane
molecule (1.50 A
 in the TS and 1.10 A
 in propane molecule).
As for the dehydrogenation taking place at the secondary C
atom, the geometry of the transition state resembles the
adsorption configuration of 2-propyl. The activation energy
is only 0.01 eV higher than that for the dehydrogenation of
methyl group, which indicates that there is no preference for
the activation of CH bonds. It is noted that these transition
states are close to the final state on the potential energy
surface, or in other words the TSs are late.37
In step (ii), the activation energies for the dehydrogenation
of 1-propyl and 2-propyl are calculated to be 0.70 and 0.68 eV,
respectively. Likewise, the configurations of the transition
states resemble the adsorption configuration of propylene.
Both the two reactions take place at the bridge site, and the
two activation energies are close and lower than 0.75 eV,
which indicates that the dehydrogenation of both 1-propyl and
2-propyl
is
kinetically
favorable
to
produce
propylene.
As shown in Table 1, the initial activation of propane is
thermoneutral, while the subsequent dehydrogenation is an
exothermic process.
For the conversion of propane to produce propylene on step
sites, the same two reaction pathways are taken into account.
The energy barriers for the initial activation of propane
occurring at the methyl and methylene groups are calculated
to be 0.32 and 0.28 eV, respectively. As shown in Fig. 5, both
the two TSs (TS1 and TS2) resemble those on the flat surface.
The subsequent dehydrogenation takes place at the edge-
bridge site, and the energy barriers for the activation of
1-propyl and 2-propyl are 0.34 and 0.33 eV, respectively. In

as the initial state. As shown in Fig. 4 (TS9), the methylene

hydrogen relaxed to the atop site. The remaining 1-propenyl
is located at the fcc site, adopting the most energetically

favorable adsorption configuration. The energy barrier is
calculated to be 0.76 eV, and the final state is 0.06 eV higher
in energy than the initial state, indicating the endothermic
nature of the reaction. Experimentally, LEED analysis was
used to verify that this reaction takes place by the capture of
1-propenyl.32 As for the activation of the CH bond at the
middle carbon, a similar energy barrier of 0.77 eV is predicted.
Using DFT calculations, Chen and Clachos57 obtained an
energy barrier of 0.84 eV for the dehydrogenation of ethylene
on Pt(111), and Vang et al.43 claimed a lower barrier of 0.68 eV
on Ni(111).
On Pt(211), the energy barriers for propylene dehydrogenation
are significantly lowered (the barriers for TS9 and TS10 are
0.29 and 0.44 eV, respectively). Meanwhile, the reverse
reactions, namely the hydrogenation of propylene to produce
1-propyl and 2-propyl, are hindered by much higher energy
barriers (0.99 eV to 1-propyl and 0.94 eV to 2-propyl,
respectively), which indicates a remarkable preference of
propylene to be further dehydrogenated. The geometries of
the transition states (TS9 and TS10) are found to be different
from those on the flat surface. As shown in Fig. 4, the
activation of the CH bond takes place at the edge-bridge
site. Both the remaining 1-propenyl and 2-propenyl favor to
bind with two Pt atoms to keep C sp3-hybridized.
3.3.2
Formation of propylidyne. Under ultra high vacuum
conditions, propylene was observed to decompose to propylidyne
just below room temperature.22 The DFT study performed by
Valca
 rcel et al.,36 verified that propylidyne was the most
energetically favorable intermediate on Pt(111). The formation
of propylidyne from propane is likely to be achieved via two
intermediates, namely 1-propyl and 1-propylidene (CHCH2CH3).
The activation energy for the dehydrogenation of 1-propyl
towards 1-propylidene is close to that for the initial activation
of propane. 1-propylidene can be readily dehydrogenated
to form propylidyne as long as the former is produced by
the a-dehydrogenation of 1-propyl. The corresponding activation
energy is calculated to be only 0.23 eV, much lower than those
for the other dehydrogenation reactions. As shown in Fig. 4
(TS7), the detached hydrogen is located at the atop site, and
the remaining propylidyne is adsorbed at the most stable fcc
site. The optimized length of the activated CH bond is
measured to be 1.36 A
 , which is the shortest among all the
TSs for dehydrogenation steps. It is difficult for propylidyne to
be further dehydrogenated to form propenylidene (CCHCH3)
or hydrogenated to form 1-propylidene. These high energy
barriers verify that propylidyne is the most stable C3 species on
the Pt(111) surface. However, the energy barrier for the
propylidyne formation on step sites is 0.52 eV higher in energy
than that on Pt(111). Chen and Vlachos57 obtained similar
energy barriers for the formation of ethylidyne (CCH3),
0.28 and 0.86 eV on Pt(111) and Pt(211), respectively.
Furthermore, it was shown by experiments that the coadsorption
of hydrogen could inhibit the decomposition of ethylidyne on
Pt(111).58
3.3.3
Formation
of
propynyl.
Propynyl
is
the
most
energetically unfavorable species on the flat surface because
the reaction heat from propane to propynyl is highest among
all the C3 derivatives.36 Jacob and Goddard59 have investigated
the chemisorption of the C2 species, and found that ethynyl
was adsorbed on the surface with C sp2-hybridized. The heat
formation analysis also indicated that ethynyl (CCH) was the
most energetically unfavorable C2 derivative. Propynyl can be
formed by detaching one hydrogen atom from propenylidene
or propyne. The activation energies are 1.38 eV for TS16 and
1.39 eV for TS17, which are much higher than those for the
other dehydrogenation reactions. It is therefore expected that
the end-point for the deep dehydrogenation process on Pt(111)
is propyne and propenylidene.
On step sites, both propenylidene and propyne are predicted
to be readily formed because of the low energy barriers and

strong binding strength. However, the activation of propyne
and propenylidene to form propynyl is also inhibited on step
sites because the energy barriers are predicted to be as high as
1.50 and 1.32 eV. As for the C2 species, CHCH was also found
to be formed at low surface coverages on Pt(110)-(12) at
300 K.60
3.4
CC cleavage of C3 intermediates on Pt(111) and Pt(211)
The bond energies of CC, C
Q
C and CRC are calculated to
be 3.95, 7.59 and 9.87 eV, indicating that the scission of
these bonds is hindered by the high barriers in the gas phase.61
In general, the CC bond could be weakened if strong
chemical bonds were formed between the metal and C
atoms.32,62 In the following study, the most preferred adsorption
configurations are assigned to be the initial states for the CC
cleavage. According to the C1 species involved in the products,
the cracking reactions are classified into four categories,
namely Type I for CH3, Type II for CH2, Type III for CH,
and Type IV when there is no C1 species. The geometries of the
TSs for the cracking reactions on Pt(111) and Pt(211) are
shown in Fig. 6 and Fig. 7, respectively. The activation
energies and activated CC bond lengths are listed in Table 2.
In
Type
I,
three
species
are
considered,
namely
CH3CH2CH3, CH3CHCH3 and CH3CCH3. The CC bond
cleavage of propane is hindered by rather high barriers of 2.44
and 1.63 eV on Pt(111) and Pt(211), respectively. This is
because propane is physisorbed on the Pt surface, and the
interaction between the Pt atom and CC bond is quite weak.
The configurations of the transition states on the two surfaces
are quite similar. As shown in Fig. 6and Fig. 7 (TS18), the
methyl and ethyl groups are located at the atop site and
repelled by each other, accompanied by the elongation of
the CC bond. For the other two cracking reactions, the
methyl group is also located at the atop site, and the ethylidene
(CHCH3) and ethylidyne groups are located at the bridge and
fcc sites, respectively, which is consistent with the work by
Michealides and Hu.34 The energy barriers for the three
cracking steps on Pt(111), ranked in descending order, are
as follows: CH3CH2CH3 > CH3CHCH3 > CH3CCH3.
Furthermore, in our recent work,61 the binding energies of
these species were 0.06 eV, 1.66 eV and 3.47 eV. Hence, it
can be deduced that the removal of hydrogen can enhance the
interaction between C and Pt atoms, and thus lower the
barriers for the cracking steps.
In Type II, CH3CH2CH2, CH3CHCH2 and CH3CCH2 are
taken into account. The di-s mode adsorption of propylene is
assigned to be the initial state, and the energy barrier for the
CC bond breaking on Pt(211) is 0.58 eV lower than that on
the flat surface,
indicating that this reaction shows a
strong preference for the step sites. The configuration of the
transition state is apparently similar to the adsorption
configuration of propylene in the p mode. Hence, propylene
tends to firstly diffuse to the atop site, and then decomposed to
methylene and ethylidene groups. With the low energy barrier
for propylene dehydrogenation considered, propylene cracking is
predicted to be unlikely to occur.
Type III includes the cracking of CH3CH2CH, CH3CHCH
and CH3CCH. The energy barriers are dramatically lowered,
as compared with those for Types I and II. For instance, the
energy barrier for the cracking of 1-propylidene (1.18 eV) on
Pt(111) is 0.51 eV lower than that for 1-propyl cracking
(1.69 eV), and 1.31 eV lower than that for propane cracking.
While the breaking of the CRC bond in propyne is assumed

to be quite difficult according to the aforementioned CRC
bond energies, the energy barrier for propyne cracking is
lowest in Type III. As shown in the geometries of these three
TSs, the methylidyne group is positioned at the most favored
fcc site. The remaining ethyl and ethylidene groups prefer to
bind with one Pt atom, and the ethylidyne group prefers three.
Type IV comprises the cracking of CH3CH2C, CH3CHC
and CH3CC. The CC bond breaking of propylidyne is
hindered by an energy barrier of 1.91 eV, which indicates that
this reaction is kinetically unfavorable on Pt(111). As for
propynyl, while the barriers for the cleavage of the CC bond
are only about 1 eV on both surfaces, cracking is unlikely to
occur because the formation of propynyl is hindered by
high barriers for the dehydrogenation of propyne and
propenylidene.
3.5
Thermodynamic factors in propane dehydrogenation
The reactions investigated in this work constitute a large
amount of data for understanding the chemistry of dehydro-
genated hydrocarbons on Pt surfaces. A linear Brnsted-
Evans-Polanyi (BEP) relationship has been observed for the
dissociation of gas-phase molecules such as CO2, N2 and O2
across different metal surfaces.63 However, for the cleavage of
different bonds over the same surface, it is not clear if the BEP
relationship holds true. As shown in Fig. 8 (a), the plot of the
energy barriers against the reaction heats for the bond-breaking
steps on Pt(111) and Pt(211) does not give a straight line.
Hence, the classical BEP relationship is not applicable in this
case. In contrast, with the method suggested by Alcala et al.,64
a good linear relationship was observed between the adsorption
energies of final states (FSs) and TSs if the total energy of the
gaseous reactant was taken as the energy reference. Two
distinct regions have been identified in Fig. 8 (b). The upper
region is dominated by the CC bond-breaking steps while the
bottom region is dominated by the CH bond-breaking steps,
and there is no obvious variation from Pt(111) to Pt(211). As
proposed by Wang and Liu,65 the energy barrier depended not
only on thermodynamics, but also on the intrinsic bond
polarity. The CC and CH bonds are known to possess
different
bond
polarities.
Under
similar
thermodynamic
conditions, it is suggested that the CH bond breaks first.
As an example, both the breaking of CC and CH bonds
of 1-propenyl on Pt(211) (Labeled as 1 and 2 in Fig. 8,
respectively.) are almost thermoneutral, though the barrier
height follows CC > CH.
3.6
Step effect on the catalytic activity towards propane
dehydrogenation
The detailed one-dimensional potential energy diagrams for
propane dehydrogenation on both the flat and stepped
surfaces are shown in Fig. 9 and Fig. 10. The sum of the total
energies of gas-phase propane and bare Pt surface is taken as
the energy reference. It is assumed that any H atoms detached
from the hydrocarbons are adsorbed on the surface at
distances far away from the C3 intermediates, which allows
us to neglect the coadsorption effect of H.
As compared to the activation energies on the flat surface,
the energy barriers for the dehydrogenation steps on the
stepped surface are quite low, ranging from 0.28 to 0.34 eV,
indicating the higher catalytic activity of the step sites. By
DFT calculations, Liu and Hu have proposed the similar trend
that the energy barrier for the activation of methane was

reduced by 0.3 eV on step sites compared to that on flat
surfaces.37 According to the Arrhenius equation, it can be
estimated that a variation of 0.40 eV in the activation energy
(e.g., the dehydrogenation of propane to form 2-propyl goes
from the flat to stepped surface) will change the rate constant
by 200 times. Thus, the stepped surface is kinetically more
favorable for propane dehydrogenation.
3.7
Step effect on the selectivity towards propylene
In propane dehydrogenation, the deep dehydrogenation and
cracking of C3 derivatives, which eventually results in the
formation of undesirable side products, will significantly lower
the selectivity towards propylene production. As shown in
Fig. 9 and Fig. 10, the CC bond scission of propylene is
hindered, arising from the much higher energy barriers than
those for propylene dehydrogenation on both surfaces, which
enables us to disregard the possibility of propylene cracking.
In this sense, it is of great importance to elucidate the
competition between propylene dehydrogenation and desorption.
Here, the activation energy difference (Edeh  Edes) between
the dehydrogenation and desorption of propylene is defined as
the selectivity descriptor. In our calculations, the energy
barrier for propylene desorption on the stepped surface is
predicted to be 1.43 eV while the energy barrier for propylene
dehydrogenation is only 0.29 eV. The negative selectivity
descriptor indicates that the deep-dehydrogenated products,
such as propenyl, propyne etc., are likely to be dominant on
the stepped surface. That is, the selectivity towards propylene
is substantially lowered in the presence of coordinatively
unsaturated surface Pt atoms. However, on the close-packed
Pt(111) surface, the energy barrier for propylene dehydrogenation
is comparable to that for propylene desorption. Furthermore,
it is reasonable to expect that the introduction of coadsorbed
H atoms may increase the activation energy for propylene
dehydrogenation and simultaneously promote the desorption
of propylene under realistic experimental conditions. Therefore,
while
the
catalytic
activity
of
the
flat
surface
toward
propane dehydrogenation is lower than that on the stepped
surface, the high selectivity towards propylene is attained on
Pt(111).
3.8
Reaction pathway for CC cleavage
In the dehydrogenation of propane, the key factor that affects
the catalytic activity of Pt catalyst is coke formation.67 Recent
studies revealed that the coke on Pt surfaces was derived from
the
cracking
of
deep-dehydrogenated
intermediates.68,69
Hence, searching for the starting point for the CC bond
breaking is of crucial importance to describe the coke mechanism
on Pt surfaces.
As for the step effect on the cracking reactions, it is apparent
from Fig. 9 and Fig. 10 that most of the activation energies on
the stepped surface are lower than those on the flat surface.
Rioux et al.66 reported the particle size effect on the
hydrogenolysis of ethane over Pt catalyst. The TOF for ethane
hydrogenolysis changes from 0.52 to 1.36  102 s1 at 643 K
for Pt particle size decreasing from 7.1 to 1.7 nm. Consequently,
the presence of the stepped surface can promote not only
the CH bond-breaking steps but also the breaking of the
CC bonds.
In addition, the energy barriers for the CC bond breaking
are lowered more significantly than those for the dehydrogenation
steps with the reactions moving from the flat to stepped
surface. For instance, the energy barrier for the CC bond
breaking of propylene on Pt(211) is 0.58 eV lower than that on
Pt(111), while the energy barrier for propylene dehydrogenation
(TS9) on Pt(211) is only 0.32 eV lower.
As shown in Fig. 9 and Fig. 10, the energy barriers for the
cracking of propane, 1-propyl, 2-propyl and propylene are
significantly higher than those for the respective dehydrogenation
steps on both Pt(111) and Pt(211), which indicates that the
CC bond breaking is not favored in the dehydrogenation of
propane to produce propylene.
With the progression of the successive deep dehydrogenation,
the activation energy differences between the cracking and
dehydrogenation elementary steps are substantially reduced
on both surfaces. It is therefore reasonable to suggest that the
cleaving of the CC bond may take place as the C3 inter-
mediates are deep dehydrogenated. Among the subsequent C3
derivatives, propyne is the sole species which prefers the
cleaving of the CC bond to the CH bond breaking [the
activation energies for propyne cracking are 0.48 and 0.11 eV
lower than those for propyne dehydrogenation on Pt(111) and
Pt(211)]. Hence, propyne is suggested to be the starting point
for the CC bond cleaving which gives rise to the formation of
C1 and C2 species as well as coke.
3.9
Overall reaction scheme for propane dehydrogenation
According to the experimental data, the C3H8 conversion and
coke formation decreased quickly in the first tens of minutes
on stream and then reached a steady state.5 Thus, the process
of propane dehydrogenation can be divided into two stages,
namely the quick deactivation stage and the steady state. At
the quick deactivation stage, the stepped surface is suggested
to be the active center for all the reactions including the
dehydrogenation and cracking steps, arising from the much
lower energy barriers. The high catalytic activity of step sites
provides a rational interpretation of the recent experimental
observations that the TOF for small particles containing more
stepped surfaces was much higher than that for larger particles

at the quick deactivation stage.5 However, the selectivity
towards propylene on step sites is rather low because
propylene prefers dehydrogenation to desorption, leading to
the deep dehydrogenation of the subsequent C3 derivatives.
According to our calculations, the deep dehydrogenation
process is terminated by propyne because the activation energy
for propyne dehydrogenation is much higher than that for
propyne cracking. Then, the CC cleaving takes place and
eventually leads to the formation of ethane, methane and coke.
As evidenced by the recent DFT work, step sites are
suggested to be the active center for coke formation.70 It is
therefore reasonable to expect that the stepped surface loses
the catalytic activity with the step sites blocked by the coke
derived from the cracking reactions. At the steady state, the
active center is transferred from the stepped to flat surface. As
a result, the conversion of propane reduces to a large extent.
Simultaneously, the selectivity toward propylene increases
because the energy barrier for propylene desorption on the
flat surface is substantially lowered compared with that on
the stepped surface. Our calculation results indicate that the
activation energy for propylene dehydrogenation is slightly
lower
than
that
for
propylene
desorption
on
Pt(111).
However, under realistic experimental conditions, H atoms
are coadsorbed with propylene, which can weaken the
chemisorption of propylene and simultaneously promote the
desorption of propylene.1 Consequently, a higher selectivity
towards propylene is expected on the flat surface.

Conclusion
This paper presents the first comprehensive DFT calculations
to elucidate the reaction mechanism of propane dehydrogenation
over Pt catalyst. The following conclusions regarding the effect
of step sites on the catalytic reactivity towards propane
dehydrogenation and the selectivity towards propylene have
been obtained.
1. The energy barriers for the dehydrogenation of propane
to form propylene are calculated to be in the region of
0.650.75 eV and 0.250.35 eV on the flat and stepped
surfaces,
respectively.
The
stepped
surface
is
therefore
kinetically more favorable for propane dehydrogenation.
2. Taking the activation energy difference between propylene
dehydrogenation and propylene desorption as the selectivity
descriptor, we find that while step sites play a crucial role in
the activation of propane dehydrogenation, the selectivity
towards propylene is substantially lowered in the presence of
the coordinatively unsaturated surface Pt atoms.
3. As the sole C3 derivative which prefers the cleaving of the
CC bond to the CH bond breaking, propyne is suggested to
be the starting point for the CC bond breaking which
eventually gives rise to the formation of methane, ethane
and coke.
4. According to previous experimental work and our DFT
calculations, the propane dehydrogenation process can be
divided into two stages, namely the quick deactivation stage
and steady state. At the quick deactivation stage, the stepped
surface is suggested to be the active center for all the reactions
including the dehydrogenation and cracking of C3 derivatives.
At this stage, the selectivity towards propylene is rather low
because propylene prefers dehydrogenation to desorption.
With the progression of the deep dehydrogenation and
cracking of C3 derivatives, coke is preferentially formed on
the stepped surface. Then, the active center is transferred from
the stepped to flat surface. At the steady state, while the
catalytic
activity
towards
propylene
dehydrogenation
is
lowered, high selectivity towards propylene is attained because
propylene desorption is promoted and simultaneously the
deep dehydrogenation of propylene is suppressed on the flat
surface. These findings provide a rational interpretation of the
recent experimental observations that smaller Pt particles
containing more step sites are much more active but less
selective than larger particles in propane dehydrogenation.
