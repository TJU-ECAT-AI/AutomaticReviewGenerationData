[1] "Pt-based catalysts have been widely used for alkane dehydrogenation reactions due to their excellent activity"

[2] "Sn is often added to alter the product distribution for hydrocarbon conversion through the inhibition of hydrogenolysis, isomerisation, cracking and coke formation, thereby enhancing the catalyst selectivity and stability"

[3] "The catalytic performances of Pt/Al2O3 and PtSn/Al2O3 catalysts for the dehydrogenation of propane through consecutive reactionregeneration cycles have been studied under realistic reaction conditions."

[4] "The presence of Sn as a promoter drastically improves the catalytic behavior. The PtASn/Al2O3 catalyst material possesses both a higher propane conversion and propene selectivity, which is maintained throughout the duration of the first dehydrogenation step."

The literature focuses primarily on platinum-based catalysts for light olefin dehydrogenation, particularly Pt and Pt-Sn catalysts supported on alumina. It does not discuss metal oxide-based catalysts like CrOx, gallium, indium, vanadium, zinc, and molybdenum oxides.

For Pt-based catalysts:

Composition: Pt/Al2O3 and PtSn/Al2O3 
Effectiveness: Excellent activity for alkane dehydrogenation
Industrial application: Used for propane dehydrogenation under realistic conditions
Recent developments: Addition of Sn as a promoter
Advantages: 
- High initial activity (Pt/Al2O3)
- Improved selectivity and stability with Sn addition (PtSn/Al2O3)
- Sn inhibits side reactions like hydrogenolysis, isomerization, cracking and coke formation
- PtSn catalysts show higher propane conversion and propene selectivity maintained over longer periods

The study demonstrates that Pt-Sn bimetallic catalysts offer significant improvements over monometallic Pt catalysts for propane dehydrogenation, showing better stability, selectivity and resistance to deactivation. However, the literature does not provide information to compare these platinum-based catalysts with metal oxide catalysts for light olefin dehydrogenation.

这篇文献主要关注了用于轻烯烃脱氢的铂基催化剂,特别是氧化铝负载的Pt和Pt-Sn催化剂。它没有讨论诸如CrOx、镓、铟、钒、锌和钼氧化物等金属氧化物基催化剂。

对于铂基催化剂:

成分:Pt/Al2O3和PtSn/Al2O3
有效性:对烷烃脱氢具有优异的活性
工业应用:在实际条件下用于丙烷脱氢
最新发展:添加Sn作为助剂
优势:
- 初始活性高(Pt/Al2O3)
- 添加Sn后选择性和稳定性提高(PtSn/Al2O3)
- Sn抑制副反应,如氢解、异构化、裂解和焦炭形成
- PtSn催化剂表现出更高的丙烷转化率和丙烯选择性,并能在更长时间内保持

该研究表明,与单金属Pt催化剂相比,Pt-Sn双金属催化剂在丙烷脱氢方面提供了显著的改进,表现出更好的稳定性、选择性和抗失活性。然而,该文献没有提供信息来比较这些铂基催化剂与金属氧化物催化剂在轻烯烃脱氢方面的性能。
