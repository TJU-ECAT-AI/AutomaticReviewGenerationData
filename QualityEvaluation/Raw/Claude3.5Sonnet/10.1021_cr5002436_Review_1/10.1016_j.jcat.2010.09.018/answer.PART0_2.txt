[1] "Pt-based catalysts have been widely used for alkane dehydrogenation reactions due to their excellent activity"

[2] "Sn is often added to alter the product distribution for hydrocarbon conversion through the inhibition of hydrogenolysis, isomerisation, cracking and coke formation, thereby enhancing the catalyst selectivity and stability"

[3] "The presence of Sn as a promoter drastically improves the catalytic behavior. The PtASn/Al2O3 catalyst material possesses both a higher propane conversion and propene selectivity, which is maintained throughout the duration of the first dehydrogenation step."

[4] "It suggests that coke precursors adsorb less strongly on the PtASn bimetallic catalyst due to an ensemble effect of Sn. Therefore, coke precursors are mobile and easily migrate to the support where they finally deposit as coke."

The literature primarily discusses platinum-based catalysts for light olefin dehydrogenation, particularly focusing on Pt and PtSn catalysts supported on alumina. It does not contain information about metal oxide-based catalysts like CrOx, gallium, indium, vanadium, zinc, and molybdenum oxides.

For Pt-based catalysts:

Composition: The study examines Pt/Al2O3 and PtSn/Al2O3 catalysts.

Effectiveness: Pt catalysts show excellent initial activity but deactivate quickly due to coke formation. PtSn catalysts demonstrate improved catalytic behavior with higher propane conversion and propene selectivity.

Industrial applications: The catalysts were tested under conditions similar to industrial propane dehydrogenation reactors.

Recent developments: The addition of Sn as a promoter to Pt catalysts significantly enhances catalyst performance by:
1. Improving selectivity and stability
2. Inhibiting side reactions like hydrogenolysis, isomerization, and cracking
3. Reducing coke formation through a "drain-off effect"

Potential advantages: PtSn catalysts maintain higher activity over multiple dehydrogenation-regeneration cycles compared to Pt-only catalysts. They also show better resistance to coking and improved propene selectivity.

The literature does not provide information to compare these catalysts with metal oxide-based catalysts for light olefin dehydrogenation.

该文献主要讨论了用于轻烯烃脱氢的铂基催化剂，特别关注了负载在氧化铝上的Pt和PtSn催化剂。文中没有包含有关CrOx、镓、铟、钒、锌和钼氧化物等金属氧化物基催化剂的信息。

对于铂基催化剂：

成分：研究考察了Pt/Al2O3和PtSn/Al2O3催化剂。

有效性：Pt催化剂显示出优异的初始活性，但由于积碳形成而快速失活。PtSn催化剂表现出改进的催化行为，具有更高的丙烷转化率和丙烯选择性。

工业应用：这些催化剂在类似于工业丙烷脱氢反应器的条件下进行了测试。

最新发展：将Sn作为助剂添加到Pt催化剂中显著提高了催化剂性能，体现在：
1. 提高选择性和稳定性
2. 抑制副反应，如氢解、异构化和裂解
3. 通过"排出效应"减少积碳形成

潜在优势：与纯Pt催化剂相比，PtSn催化剂在多个脱氢-再生循环中保持更高的活性。它们还表现出更好的抗积碳能力和更高的丙烯选择性。

该文献没有提供将这些催化剂与用于轻烯烃脱氢的金属氧化物基催化剂进行比较的信息。
