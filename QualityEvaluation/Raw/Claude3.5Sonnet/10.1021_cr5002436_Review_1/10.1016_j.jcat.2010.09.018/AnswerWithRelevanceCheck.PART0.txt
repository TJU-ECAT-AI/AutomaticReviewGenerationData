          [1] "Pt-based catalysts have been widely used for alkane dehydrogenation reactions due to their excellent activity"

[2] "Sn is often added to alter the product distribution for hydrocarbon conversion through the inhibition of hydrogenolysis, isomerisation, cracking and coke formation, thereby enhancing the catalyst selectivity and stability"

[3] "The PtASn/Al2O3 catalyst possesses both a higher propane conversion and propene selectivity, which is maintained throughout the duration of the first dehydrogenation step."

[4] "The presence of Sn not only reduces the amount of coke formed during a propane dehydrogenation run but also modifies its rate of formation."

[5] "The catalytic performances of Pt/Al2O3 and PtSn/Al2O3 catalysts for the dehydrogenation of propane through consecutive reactionregeneration cycles have been studied under realistic reaction conditions."

[6] "It suggests that coke precursors adsorb less strongly on the PtASn bimetallic catalyst due to an ensemble effect of Sn. Therefore, coke precursors are mobile and easily migrate to the support where they finally deposit as coke."

[7] "Pt/Al2O3 catalyst exhibits a higher initial propane conversion than the PtASn/Al2O3 catalyst. However, the initial selectivity to propene is much lower (60%) when compared to the PtASn/Al2O3 catalyst (90%)"

          The literature primarily focuses on platinum-based catalysts, particularly Pt and Pt-Sn systems supported on alumina, for the dehydrogenation of light alkanes, specifically propane. It does not provide information on metal oxide-based catalysts like CrOx, gallium, indium, vanadium, zinc, and molybdenum oxides.

Composition: The study examines Pt/Al2O3 and PtSn/Al2O3 catalysts, with Sn added as a promoter to Pt.

Effectiveness: Pt-based catalysts show excellent activity for alkane dehydrogenation. Pt catalysts exhibit higher initial propane conversion but lower propene selectivity (60%) compared to PtSn catalysts. The addition of Sn improves propane conversion, propene selectivity (90%), and catalyst stability.

Industrial applications: These catalysts are used for the dehydrogenation of light alkanes, specifically propane to propene, under conditions similar to industrial propane dehydrogenation reactors.

Recent developments: The research presents detailed in-situ spectroscopic studies to understand catalyst behavior during multiple reaction-regeneration cycles, providing insights into deactivation mechanisms and Pt-Sn alloy formation. The study investigates the effects of adding Sn to Pt catalysts, showing improved propene selectivity and catalyst stability.

Potential advantages: PtSn catalysts show higher propene selectivity, better stability, and improved resistance to coking compared to Pt-only catalysts. The presence of Sn inhibits side reactions like hydrogenolysis, isomerization, cracking, and coke formation. PtSn catalysts maintain higher activity over multiple dehydrogenation-regeneration cycles.

The literature does not provide information to compare these Pt-based catalysts with metal oxide catalysts for light olefin dehydrogenation.

          该文献主要集中在研究用于轻质烷烃（特别是丙烷）脱氢的铂基催化剂，尤其是以氧化铝为载体的Pt和Pt-Sn体系。文中没有提供关于金属氧化物基催化剂（如CrOx、镓、铟、钒、锌和钼氧化物）的信息。

成分：研究考察了Pt/Al2O3和PtSn/Al2O3催化剂，其中锡作为助剂添加到铂中。

有效性：铂基催化剂对烷烃脱氢表现出优异的活性。Pt催化剂表现出较高的初始丙烷转化率，但丙烯选择性较低（60%）。添加锡可以改善丙烷转化率、丙烯选择性（90%）和催化剂稳定性。

工业应用：这些催化剂用于轻质烷烃的脱氢，特别是在类似于工业丙烷脱氢反应器条件下将丙烷转化为丙烯。

最新发展：该研究提供了详细的原位光谱研究，以了解催化剂在多个反应-再生循环过程中的行为，提供了关于失活机制和Pt-Sn合金形成的见解。研究调查了向铂催化剂中添加Sn的影响，显示出改善的丙烯选择性和催化剂稳定性。

潜在优势：与纯Pt催化剂相比，Pt-Sn催化剂表现出更高的丙烯选择性、更好的稳定性和更强的抗积碳能力。Sn的存在抑制了副反应，如氢解、异构化、裂解和焦炭形成。PtSn催化剂在多个脱氢-再生循环中保持更高的活性。

该文献没有提供将这些Pt基催化剂与金属氧化物催化剂在轻烯烃脱氢方面进行比较的信息。
