[1] "Pt-based catalysts have been widely used for alkane dehydrogenation reactions due to their excellent activity"

[2] "Sn is often added to alter the product distribution for hydrocarbon conversion through the inhibition of hydrogenolysis, isomerisation, cracking and coke formation, thereby enhancing the catalyst selectivity and stability"

[3] "The PtASn/Al2O3 catalyst possesses both a higher propane conversion and propene selectivity, which is maintained throughout the duration of the first dehydrogenation step."

[4] "The presence of Sn not only reduces the amount of coke formed during a propane dehydrogenation run but also modifies its rate of formation."

The literature focuses primarily on Pt and Pt-Sn catalysts for propane dehydrogenation, so it does not provide a comprehensive comparison with metal oxide-based catalysts. However, some key points about Pt-based catalysts can be noted:

1. Composition: Pt/Al2O3 and Pt-Sn/Al2O3 catalysts are discussed, with Sn added as a promoter to Pt.

2. Effectiveness: Pt-based catalysts show excellent activity for alkane dehydrogenation. The addition of Sn improves propane conversion, propene selectivity, and catalyst stability.

3. Industrial applications: These catalysts are used for the dehydrogenation of light alkanes, specifically propane to propene.

4. Recent developments: The study investigates the behavior of Pt and Pt-Sn catalysts over multiple dehydrogenation-regeneration cycles, providing insights into long-term performance and deactivation mechanisms.

5. Potential advantages: Pt-Sn catalysts show higher propene selectivity, better resistance to coke formation, and improved stability compared to Pt-only catalysts.

The literature does not discuss metal oxide-based catalysts like CrOx, gallium, indium, vanadium, zinc, and molybdenum oxides, so a comparison cannot be made based on this text alone.

The literature focuses mainly on platinum-based catalysts, particularly Pt and Pt-Sn systems supported on alumina, for the dehydrogenation of propane. It does not provide information on metal oxide-based catalysts like CrOx, gallium, indium, vanadium, zinc, and molybdenum oxides.

For the Pt-based catalysts discussed:

Composition: Pt/Al2O3 and PtSn/Al2O3 (with 0.5 wt% Pt and 1.5 wt% Sn)

Effectiveness: Pt catalysts show high initial activity but deactivate quickly due to coke formation. Addition of Sn improves catalyst stability, propene selectivity, and resistance to deactivation.

Industrial applications: The study uses conditions similar to industrial propane dehydrogenation reactors, indicating these catalysts are relevant for industrial processes.

Recent developments: The research presents detailed in-situ spectroscopic studies to understand catalyst behavior during multiple reaction-regeneration cycles, providing insights into deactivation mechanisms and Pt-Sn alloy formation.

Potential advantages: Pt-Sn catalysts show higher propene selectivity, better stability, and improved resistance to coking compared to Pt-only catalysts.

The literature does not provide information to compare these Pt-based catalysts with metal oxide catalysts for light olefin dehydrogenation.
