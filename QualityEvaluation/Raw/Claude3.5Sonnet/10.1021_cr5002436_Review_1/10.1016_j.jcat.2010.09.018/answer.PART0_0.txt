[1] "Pt-based catalysts have been widely used for alkane dehydrogenation reactions due to their excellent activity"

[2] "Sn is often added to alter the product distribution for hydrocarbon conversion through the inhibition of hydrogenolysis, isomerisation, cracking and coke formation, thereby enhancing the catalyst selectivity and stability"

[3] "The PtASn/Al2O3 catalyst possesses both a higher propane conversion and propene selectivity, which is maintained throughout the duration of the first dehydrogenation step."

[4] "The presence of Sn not only reduces the amount of coke formed during a propane dehydrogenation run but also modifies its rate of formation."

The literature focuses primarily on Pt and Pt-Sn catalysts for propane dehydrogenation, so it does not provide a comprehensive comparison with metal oxide-based catalysts. However, some key points about Pt-based catalysts can be noted:

1. Composition: Pt/Al2O3 and Pt-Sn/Al2O3 catalysts are discussed, with Sn added as a promoter to Pt.

2. Effectiveness: Pt-based catalysts show excellent activity for alkane dehydrogenation. The addition of Sn improves propane conversion, propene selectivity, and catalyst stability.

3. Industrial applications: These catalysts are used for the dehydrogenation of light alkanes, specifically propane to propene.

4. Recent developments: The study investigates the behavior of Pt and Pt-Sn catalysts over multiple dehydrogenation-regeneration cycles, providing insights into long-term performance and deactivation mechanisms.

5. Potential advantages: Pt-Sn catalysts show higher propene selectivity, better resistance to coke formation, and improved stability compared to Pt-only catalysts.

The literature does not discuss metal oxide-based catalysts like CrOx, gallium, indium, vanadium, zinc, and molybdenum oxides, so a comparison cannot be made based on this text alone.

该文献主要集中在研究用于丙烷脱氢的铂和铂-锡催化剂，因此没有提供与金属氧化物基催化剂的全面比较。然而，关于铂基催化剂可以注意到一些要点：

1. 成分：讨论了Pt/Al2O3和Pt-Sn/Al2O3催化剂，其中锡作为助剂添加到铂中。

2. 有效性：铂基催化剂对烷烃脱氢表现出优异的活性。添加锡可以改善丙烷转化率、丙烯选择性和催化剂稳定性。

3. 工业应用：这些催化剂用于轻质烷烃的脱氢，特别是丙烷到丙烯的转化。

4. 最新发展：该研究考察了铂和铂-锡催化剂在多个脱氢-再生循环中的行为，提供了关于长期性能和失活机理的见解。

5. 潜在优势：与仅含铂的催化剂相比，铂-锡催化剂表现出更高的丙烯选择性、更好的抗积碳能力和更高的稳定性。

该文献没有讨论金属氧化物基催化剂，如CrOx、镓、铟、钒、锌和钼氧化物，因此仅基于这篇文献无法进行比较。
