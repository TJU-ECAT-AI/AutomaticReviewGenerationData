The catalytic performances of Pt/Al2O3 and PtSn/Al2O3 catalysts for the dehydrogenation of propane
through consecutive reactionregeneration cycles have been studied under realistic reaction conditions.
A 10-fold successive dehydrogenationregeneration cycling study, similar to that employed in an indus-
trial propane dehydrogenation reactor, was performed in order to examine the catalyst activity and sta-
bility as well as the propene selectivity. Combined in situ UVVis/Raman spectroscopy measurements
were taken in order to follow the coke formation processes during propane dehydrogenation. This
approach allowed correlating propane conversion and propene formation with the on-line determined
Raman D over G band intensity ratio and amount of coke formed. These in situ measurements on coke
formation and related catalyst deactivation were supplemented by in situ high-energy resolution fluores-
cence detected (HERFD) XANES measurements in order to characterize the structural and electronic prop-
erties of the supported Pt and PtASn nanoparticles during the successive dehydrogenationregeneration
cycles. This combination of powerful spectroscopic techniques revealed unique information regarding the
activity behavior and deactivation mechanism of Pt- and PtASn-based propane dehydrogenation cata-
lysts, enabling us to identify important structure-electronic-performance relationships as well as funda-
mental insight into the dynamics of PtASn alloy formation processes in Pt nanoparticles at elevated
temperatures.

1. Introduction
The catalytic dehydrogenation of light alkanes, such as propane,
is of great commercial interest due to the growing demand of pro-
pene as an important base chemical intermediate [14]. Pt-based
catalysts have been widely used for alkane dehydrogenation reac-
tions due to their excellent activity [5]. However, this catalyst sys-
tem suffers from fast deactivation due to coke formation. There are
several strategies to improve the catalytic behavior of Pt, including
its promotion with a second metal [6,7]. Sn is often added to alter
the product distribution for hydrocarbon conversion through the
inhibition of hydrogenolysis, isomerisation, cracking and coke for-
mation, thereby enhancing the catalyst selectivity and stability
[7,8]. However, the mechanism by which Sn as promoter modifies
the catalytic behavior of Pt remains a matter of debate due to the
complicated nature of the PtASn alloy system. On the other hand,
even though Sn is one of the most efficient promoters, deactivation
due to coke formation is not avoidable and results in catalyst mate-
rials still exhibiting short lifetimes. As such, coked catalysts need to
undergo a regeneration process (i.e., coke burning) in order to re-
store the activity. The regeneration treatment typically consists
of exposing the coked catalyst to air or oxygen at high tempera-
tures to burn the deposits, followed by a reduction step to bring
back the active form of the catalyst (i.e., metallic Pt). Thus, it is
important to consider that the exposure of the catalyst material
to such oxidation and reduction cycles modifies the catalysts prop-
erties (both structural and electronic), which affects the behavior
of the catalysts for subsequent dehydrogenation cycle(s). However,
to the best of our knowledge, the majority of literature work
mainly concentrates on the characterization of catalyst systems
before and after only one dehydrogenation cycle; the study of Pa-
dro et al. in which multiple regeneration steps were employed is
the only notable exception [9]. Therefore, unfortunately to date,
it has not been possible to extract conclusive information regard-
ing the basic principles of catalyst operation/deactivation of this
important catalyst system under real reaction conditions.

In this work, the catalytic performance of Al2O3-supported Pt
and PtASn catalysts has been investigated and compared for the
selective dehydrogenation of propane to propene under industri-
ally relevant conditions. The work makes use of two separate
in situ reactor setups: one that utilizes a powder-containing,
plug-flow reactor setup that combines on-line activity measure-
ments with the simultaneous recording of in situ UVVis and
Raman spectroscopy data and a second setup consisting of a flow-
through cell using a pressed pellet sample that has been developed
so that it is possible to perform catalytic reactions with on-line
product monitoring at the outlet (mass spectrometer) while per-
forming in situ high-energy resolution fluorescence detected (HER-
FD) X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) measurements [10,11].
The results obtained from these innovative real-time characteriza-
tion studies show a difference in behavior for the catalyst materials
(in the presence/absence of Sn as promoter) with regard to both
propane dehydrogenation/activation and coke formation (in both
the amount and type of coke formed). Differences in the oxidation
state and the electronic properties and the local structures of Pt
and Sn in PtASn catalysts during successive activationreaction
regeneration cycles that affect the propane activation mechanism
were also followed and have been correlated with the extent of al-
loy formation. In addition, we observed that during the regenera-
tion process in oxygen to burn-off the formed coke on the
catalyst, sintering or segregation of the metals also takes place,
causing irreversible deactivation of the catalyst. Based on these
new insights, a comprehensive working model for the short- and
long-term deactivation of PtASn dehydrogenation catalysts is
proposed.
2. Materials and methods
2.1. Catalyst preparation and physicochemical characterization
A series of Al2O3-supported Pt and PtASn (Pt: 0.5 wt.% and Sn:
1.5 wt.%) catalysts have been prepared. The proportion of both
metals was chosen similar to that employed for PtASn-based
industrial catalysts used in the dehydrogenation of propane in or-
der to establish a close correspondence between the model and
real systems. The catalyst materials have been synthesized making
use of the incipient wet co-impregnation method of a commercial
alumina carrier (Norton, 89 m2/g). Solutions containing the metal
precursors were prepared containing 1.27 g H2PtCl6 (39.96% Pt;
Degussa) and 2.91 g SnCl22H2O (Merck, p.a.) diluted in 600 ml eth-
anol 99.9%. Hundred grams of the carrier material was impreg-
nated with the solution. The ethanol was then evaporated by
using a rotavap (50 C, 20 mbar). The obtained catalyst materials
were calcined for 3 h at 560 C. After propane dehydrogenation,
the coke contents of a selection of catalyst samples have been
determined using thermogravimetrical analysis in artificial air
using a Perkin-Elmer Pyris 1 TGA instrument.
2.2. In situ X-ray absorption spectroscopy
Experiments at the Sn K edge and Pt L3 edge during H2 reduc-
tion were conducted using an in situ cell, which allows the inves-
tigation
of
the
catalyst
materials
using
X-ray
absorption
spectroscopy (XAS) for sample temperatures from 25 to 500 C.
This was integrated with a gas flow system in order to switch be-
tween different gas atmospheres. EXAFS measurements were ta-
ken
at
the
DUBBLE
(BM26A)
beamline
of
the
European
Synchrotron Research Facility (ESRF, Grenoble, France). The beam-
line was equipped with a double Si(1 1 1) crystal monochromator.
Measurements were taken in fluorescence mode using a 9-element
germanium detector. The samples were prepared by hand pressing
0.1 g of powder into a self-supporting wafer. This wafer was then
placed in a treatment cell and reduced in a flow of 10% H2 in He
for 30 min at 450 C, the temperature ramp-up rate being 5 C/min.
Afterward, the cell was cooled down and Pt L3 edge EXAFS scans
were acquired at liquid N2 temperature. Each measurement was
repeated two times. The EXAFS data analysis was carried out
with the EXCURV program. The EXAFS data were extracted from
the averaged absorption spectra through pre-edge subtraction
using a modified Victoreen curve and then through background
subtraction employing cubic spline routines with a continuously
adjustable smoothing factor. Finally, the average spectrum was
normalized by dividing the data by the absorption intensity at
50 eV after the edge. The obtained chi (v) function was analyzed
by multiple shells data fitting in k-space with a k3-weighting. From
the EXAFS analysis, the obtained first-shell PtAPt coordination
numbers were used to evaluate the average Pt particle size.
2.3. Model calculations for ideal Pt and PtASn nanoparticle geometries
In order to extract particle morphology/bimetal distribution
information from the XAFS results, we performed a series of
numerical simulations to determine coordination numbers for
the first two coordination (Pt and Sn) shells, for different theoret-
ical bimetal particle morphologies. Details on these calculations
can be found elsewhere [12]. Bimetal structures were created using
the nanocluster building function of the Materials Studio software
package based on a Pt unit cell and substituting some Pt atoms for
Sn. Various structures were simulated with differing bimetal
arrangements including spherical, hemispherical and cubic struc-
tures with decorated, coreshell, hemi-sphere and random alloy
distributions. The final structures proposed were based on fits
(coordination number variability of 0.1) to the obtained coordina-
tion numbers from the experimental EXAFS analysis.
2.4. CO temperature-programmed desorption infrared spectroscopy
Infrared (IR) measurements were taken on self-supporting cat-
alyst wafers (/ = 7 mm) that were pressed from 0.01 g to 0.02 g of
sample material. A pressure of no more than 2 bar was applied dur-
ing a period of 10 s to prevent the destruction of the pore structure
of the support. The wafer was placed in an IR transmission cell
equipped with CaF2 windows. The cell was connected to a gas han-
dling system, which allowed measurements under low pressure
(106 bar) as well as under gas flow. The cell was evacuated to
106 bar at 50 C for 30 min prior to reduction by 60 ml/min flow
of H2 (quality 5.0; Hoekloos). During reduction, the temperature
was raised from 50 C to 450 C at 3 C/min and maintained for
30 min at 450 C. The system was then switched back to vacuum
for 30 min at 450 C, before being cooled down to 50 C at a rate
of 3 C/min. A first spectrum was taken under vacuum and served
as background reference for the catalyst wafer. Next, 10% CO (qual-
ity 4.7; Linde AG) in He (quality 4.6; Linde AG) was introduced in
the cell until a stable pressure of ca. 0.06 bar was reached. After
30 min of static CO exposure, the cell was evacuated to a pressure
of
2  106
bar
for
30 min
at
50 C
before
Temperature-
programmed desorption (TPD) was started by increasing the
temperature up to 450 C at a rate of 3 C/min. IR spectra were
recorded every 2 min on a Perkin-Elmer 2000 FT-IR instrument
with an optical resolution of 4 cm1 and an accumulation of 25
scans with wavenumbers ranging from 4000 cm1 to 1300 cm1.
The data acquisition was performed automatically using the
Perkin-Elmer Time-Base software. The reproducibility of all IR-TPD
measurements was verified by repeating the experiments in two
different ways: (1) On two different wafers from the same sample
and (2) on the same wafer by applying the same procedure two
times in a row without opening the IR cell. Band positions and

269
corresponding area data were estimated from the baseline-corrected
spectra using the Perkin-Elmer Time-Base software package.
2.5. Catalytic activity and coke formation measurements
The catalytic activity testing was carried out in an in situ com-
bined UVVis/Raman setup with on-line gas chromatography (GC)
analysis. Details of this experimental setup can be found elsewhere
[11]. A cylindrical quartz reactor with a square section which was
made out of optical grade quartz windows was placed in an oven;
the optical grade windows allow for the collection of high-quality
Raman and UVVis data. A Kaiser Optical Systems Inc. Raman spec-
trometer was placed on one side of the reactor. Spectra were re-
corded in Holograms 4.0 with an exposure time of 7 s and 11
accumulations. On the other side of the reactor, a high-tempera-
ture UVVis probe was positioned detecting every 2 min (5 s, 10
accumulations) in situ UVVis spectra. Since the reflectance prop-
erties of the catalyst material (i.e., catalyst darkening) changed
during the reaction due to the formation of coke on the catalyst,
a correction on the observed Raman intensity was made by UV
Vis. Details of this procedure can be found elsewhere [13]; 0.5 g
of catalyst was placed in the reactor as packed bed on quartz wool.
A variable gas feed was introduced in the reactor. The quantifica-
tion of the gas products was possible by an on-line Interscience
compact GC equipped with two detectors, namely a FID and TCD
with a Porabond-Q and a Carboxan column, respectively. At the
outlet of the reactor, the gas stream was diluted with He for GC
analysis. Chromatograms were acquired every 5 min. Different
conditions were employed for the activity measurements:
(a) Pre-treatment: The samples were pre-activated in the same
reactor before C3H8 dehydrogenation reaction was carried
out. A H2 flow (9.5 ml min1) was introduced, while the tem-
perature was increased from room temperature up to 590 C
with a temperature ramp of 10 C min1. After the reduction,
the reactor was purged with He for 5 min.
(b) Dehydrogenation reaction: After reduction, a gas stream of
pure propane (9 ml min1) humidified with 9 v/v% of steam
was introduced in the reactor. The reaction proceeded for
6 h at 590 C, and after this treatment, the system was
purged with He for 5 min.
(c) Regeneration process: The sample was regenerated at the
same temperature in an oxygen environment to burn the
coke from the catalyst material. The regeneration process
consisted of a moderate reoxidation in 7% of O2 for 1 h and
a more severe reoxidation in 20% of O2 at 590 C. After this
time, no CO2 was detected in the GC, which suggests that
the burn-off of the coke was complete. The system was
purged with He for 5 min.
(d) Re-activation of the catalyst: Without modifying the tem-
perature, a reduction step was first performed to activate
the catalyst material. This time a gas flow of 20% of H2 in
He was used. After a He purge, the dehydrogenation reaction
was started again and considered as a new cycle. This cycle
was repeated 10 times and after the reactor was cooled
down in He to RT.
2.6. In situ high-energy resolution fluorescence detected X-ray
absorption spectroscopy
Measurements were taken at the ID26 beamline of ESRF (Grenoble,
France). High-energy resolution fluorescence detected (HERFD)
X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) at the L3 (11.5637 keV) edges
was performed on the Pt/Al2O3 and PtASn/Al2O3 catalysts under
the same gas conditions and reaction temperatures as discussed
above for the combined in situ UVVis/Raman spectroscopy
measurements. For these HERFD-XAS measurements, we used
the horizontal plane Rowland circle spectrometer tuned to the Pt
La1 (9.442 eV) fluorescence line. The (660) Bragg reflection of four
spherically bent Ge wafers with R = 1 m and a diameter of 89 mm
was required. Approximately, 40 mg of catalyst was pressed to a
self-supporting wafer, which fits in the sample holder.
An in situ cell provided by the Sample Environment Support
Service (SESS) of the ESRF was used. It is specially designed for
the use of pelleted samples and allows for the measurement of
fluorescence data [10]. The maximum working temperature can
go up to 1000 C. The gas cell included cooling loops, thermal cou-
ples and heaters all built-in. It was also equipped with a gas flow
control (from the ID26 ESRF beamline) to use different gas atmo-
sphere. The experimental runs consist of an in situ pre-reduction
at 600 C (20% H2/He) followed by continuous propane dehydroge-
nation (10% C3H8/He) until the temperature reaches 600 C. Then,
subsequent step changes in the gas mixture under isothermal con-
ditions were applied; i.e., cycles of propane dehydrogenation (10%
C3H8/He), regeneration in O2 atmosphere and re-reduction in H2,
similar to the catalytic study described above. An on-line mass
spectrometer provided a measure of the global catalytic process
at hand through monitoring the composition of the gaseous feed-
stock, ensuring reproduction, on the ESRF beamline of a reaction
environment and of catalytic performances similar to those pres-
ent in the in situ UVVis/Raman setup described above.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Catalytic activity studies of supported Pt and PtASn nanoparticles
Fig. 1 shows an overview of the catalytic performances of the Pt
and PtASn/Al2O3 catalyst materials during 10 successive dehydro-
genationregeneration cycles. Although the fresh Pt/Al2O3 catalyst
exhibits the highest initial reaction activity, after 6 h of reaction,
the catalyst deactivates very fast with propane conversions
decreasing from 40% to 5%. After this first reaction and subsequent
isothermal regeneration process, the catalytic activity is observed
to be much lower during the second and third reaction cycles,
resulting in almost no net conversion after three dehydrogena-
tionregeneration cycles.
In contrast, the presence of Sn as a promoter drastically im-
proves the catalytic behavior. The PtASn/Al2O3 catalyst material
possesses both a higher propane conversion and propene selectiv-
ity, which is maintained throughout the duration of the first dehy-
drogenation step. As with the Pt/Al2O3 catalyst, a decrease in the
catalytic activity is also observed after the first regeneration treat-
ment. However, this happens more gradually than for the Pt/Al2O3
catalyst. Further deactivation occurs during subsequent dehydro-
genationregeneration cycles although a steady state is reached
after 56 cycles. Interestingly, despite this gradual catalyst deacti-
vation, the net conversion during the experiment is always higher
for the PtASn/Al2O3 catalyst than for the Pt/Al2O3 catalyst. This is
illustrated in Fig. 1A.
The corresponding propene selectivities of the Pt/Al2O3 and
PtASn/Al2O3 catalysts are shown in Fig. 1B. It is clear that for the
fresh Pt/Al2O3 catalyst, the propene selectivity decreases with reac-
tion time. However, in contrast, the PtASn/Al2O3 catalyst not only
shows higher overall propene selectivity, but also the selectivity
increases gradually throughout the experiment. After the first
regeneration process, the PtASn/Al2O3 catalyst still presents high
selectivity, which remains constant during the cycle. Nevertheless,
for the following dehydrogenation cycles, a decrease in selectivity
was observed during the reaction time which became more acute
after 56 cycles. The hydrocarbon distribution for the Pt/Al2O3
and PtASn/Al2O3 catalysts during the multiple reaction cycles is
270

given in Fig. S1, indicating that besides propene also ethane, ethene
and some methane are formed.
3.2. Analysis of coke deposit formation and its relation to catalyst
performance
The amount of coke deposited on the catalyst materials after
propane dehydrogenation for 6 h was measured by using thermo-
gravimetrical analysis. The amount of coke on the Pt/Al2O3 and
PtASn/Al2O3 catalysts was 8.2 and 7.3% w/w, respectively. The for-
mation of coke on a PtASn/Al2O3 catalyst was only a bit lower than
on a Pt/Al2O3 catalyst; however, the influence on the propane
dehydrogenation activity and propene selectivity appears to be
much more significant and merited a more detailed spectroscopic
investigation of the coke formed.
As a result, we have on-line monitored the formation of
coke during propane dehydrogenation using a combined in situ
UVVis/Raman setup. The in situ UVVis spectra were used to perform
a correction of the decrease in the Raman signal caused by the
darkening of the catalyst as coke deposits gradually formed on
the catalyst surface. Detailed information about this procedure
can be found elsewhere [13], and the coke amount from the TGA
analysis was used to quantify the in situ Raman data. As an exam-
ple, Fig. 2 shows the raw in situ Raman spectra for the Pt/Al2O3 cat-
alyst during the first propane dehydrogenation cycle measured at
590 C.
Two distinct Raman bands at around 1584 and 1321 cm1 were
observed. These Raman bands can be ascribed to coke G and D
modes, respectively. Single crystal graphite has a single Raman ac-
tive mode, (the zone-center mode) at 1580 cm1 of E2g symmetry
and is labeled G for graphite. Disordered graphite has a second
mode around 1350 cm1 of A1g symmetry labeled D for disorder.
It corresponds to a breathing vibration of rings at the K zone
boundary [14,15]. An unusual and significant fact is that the Raman
spectra of most disordered carbons remain dominated by these
two G and D modes of graphite, even when the carbons do not have
a particular graphitic ordering [16]. The G mode is actually the
stretching vibration of any pair of sp2 sites, whether in C@C chains
or in aromatic rings [16]. This mode is then also seen in ethylene as
well as in graphite but is blue-shifted to higher wavenumbers.
Thus, G in this instance does not only mean graphite. The D mode
is the breathing mode of those sp2 sites only in rings, not in chains.
Therefore, these bands provide information not only on the
amount of coke present on the catalyst, but also on its nature.
Ferrari and Robertson [16] found that it is possible to classify the
Raman spectra of carbons, using the intensity ratio of the D and
G bands, within a three-stage model of disorder degree as follows:
(1) sp3 amorphous carbons (a-C) to sp2 a-C, (2) a-C sp2 to nano-
crystalline graphite and (3) nano-crystalline graphite to more per-
fect graphite.
The Raman intensity profile of the coke band located at
1584 cm1 after UVVis correction is shown in Fig. S2. It was noted
that the amount of coke in the Pt/Al2O3 and PtASn/Al2O3 catalysts
gradually increases during propane dehydrogenation, but after
regeneration treatment the total amount of coke decreases in the
successive cycles. This behavior parallels the propane conversion
profiles. For the PtASn/Al2O3 catalyst, the presence of Sn not only

reduces the amount of coke formed during a propane dehydroge-
nation run but also modifies its rate of formation.
The intensity ratio of the D and G Raman bands at around 1321
and 1584 cm1, respectively, provides information on the type of
coke that is formed on the surface. The results are displayed in
Fig. 3 for cycle 1, 2 and 10, together with the activity data for the
Pt/Al2O3 and PtASn/Al2O3 catalysts. For Pt/Al2O3, an initial D over
G ratio of 0.4 is observed. This ratio increases with time on stream
until reaching a value of around 1 where it remains constant even
after one hour of reaction. These results suggest that at the begin-
ning of the catalytic reaction, a more disordered aliphatic type of
coke forms and after 1 h the amount of coke increases but without
changing its nature. A similar trend is observed in the following
additional propane dehydrogenation cycles. In the case of the
PtASn/Al2O3 catalyst, the initial D over G ratio is around 0.7 and re-
mains almost constant during the cycle, indicating that no changes
take place in the nature of the coke. However, after the first regen-
eration process, the coke formed at the beginning of the next dehy-
drogenation cycle seems more disordered and with reaction time,
the D over G ratio first increases, but after one hour-on-stream
the D over G ratio decreases. This indicates that the nature of coke
becomes more graphitic; the propene would initially form oligo-
mers (or polymers) and aromatics, but after a while, these surface
species would lose hydrogen and become more graphitic. Fig. 3
also shows that the change in the nature of the coke deposits coin-
cides with a maximum in propane conversion. Apparently, then
the type of coke influences the activity of the propane dehydroge-
nation reaction. In the 10th dehydrogenation cycle, the same
behavior is observed showing a clear relation between the deacti-
vation of the catalyst material and the formation of more graphitic
coke.
The Pt/Al2O3 catalyst exhibits a higher initial propane conver-
sion than the PtASn/Al2O3 catalyst. However, the initial selectivity
to propene is much lower (60%) when compared to the PtASn/
Al2O3 catalyst (90%) (Fig. 1B). The high selectivity toward crack-
ing products, namely methane and ethane, for the Pt/Al2O3 cata-
lyst, as illustrated in Fig. S1, indicates that the supported Pt
nanoparticles in this catalyst are very active for CAC bond activa-
tion [1719]. From the above observation, it can be suggested that
a reaction mechanism involving common surface intermediates,
which form activated/partly dehydrogenated propane, can either
desorb as C3H6 or further undergo cracking to C1, C2 and even to
surface carbon deposits. The fast decrease in conversion points to
a rapid deactivation of the catalyst probably caused by the blocking
of active Pt sites by coke formation.
During the first dehydrogenation cycle, the PtASn/Al2O3 cata-
lyst shows lower initial propane conversion and a higher rate of
coke formation when compared to the Pt/Al2O3 catalyst. In the
presence of Sn, the light products that are produced are ethane
and methane in equimolar amounts, which is typical for a metal-
catalyzed hydrogenolysis reaction (Fig. S1). The selectivity to light
products is much lower and decreases with time, suggesting that
the hydrogenolysis reaction is inhibited by coke formation on the
metal particles [7]. However, despite the amount of coke formed,
PtASn/Al2O3 exhibits a much higher selectivity to propene and
the amount of propene increases together with propane conversion
with time on stream, displaying better catalyst stability than the
Pt/Al2O3 catalyst.
The results indicate that the presence of Sn not only modifies
the electronic properties of the Pt nanoparticles and therefore
the activation of propane but also produces a drain-off effect. This
drain-off effect keeps the Pt sites clean by removing the coke pre-
cursors from the vicinity of active sites to the support. This hypoth-
esis was first proposed by Lieske et al. and has been discussed in
the context of a particle ensemble effect [20]. It suggests that coke
precursors such as olefinic species adsorb less strongly on the

PtASn bimetallic catalyst due to an ensemble effect of Sn. There-
fore, coke precursors are mobile and easily migrate to the support
where they finally deposit as coke. In recent work, Kumar et al. [21]
proposed a modified drain-off effect, which is based on a combi-
nation of the electronic and drain-off effects. After one regeneration
process, although the Pt/Al2O3 catalyst exhibits lower propane
conversion, the same catalytic behavior and coke evolution is
observed. On the other hand, the PtASn/Al2O3 catalyst material
possesses both different activity and different coke formation with
respect to the initial dehydrogenation cycle, which suggests a
modification of the properties of the active sites.
3.3. Electronic and structural characterization of Pt and PtASn
nanoparticles
3.3.1. XANES-EXAFS analysis
The normalized L3 XANES spectra obtained for the Pt/Al2O3 cat-
alyst after H2 reduction display a characteristic Pt(0) spectrum
with the same edge position as a Pt foil reference. However, while
the spectrum shape of the PtASn/Al2O3 catalyst also resembles that
of the Pt foil, the absorption edge is shifted to higher energy
(Fig. S3). This points to a clear electronic interaction between the
Sn and Pt and in particular that Sn withdraws electron density
from Pt. Also a clear red shift is visible for the 5f Continuum Reso-
nance (CR), located at ca. 11,592 eV, with respect to the Pt/Al2O3
sample (Fig. S3). This red shift indicates an increase in the PtAPt
nearest distance most likely associated with the dissolution of Sn
atoms in the Pt fcc structure and the incipient formation of an alloy
phase [22].
The Sn K edge was also measured during H2 treatment. XANES
analysis shows that Sn is presented initially as SnO2 and reduction
to SnO takes place during the ramp of temperature in H2 (Fig. S4).
From Pt XAS results, it is clear that an interaction between both
metals exists and PtASn alloy formation is detected. However, it
is not possible to extract the same conclusions from Sn K edge data,
as X-ray absorption is a bulk technique and there are three times
more Sn than Pt in the sample and EXAFS results for Pt indicates
that only a small fraction of Sn comes into the alloy. Therefore, it
is not possible to distinguish this phenomenon of alloy formation
in the data from Sn K edge as for the most part SnO is detected.
Coordination numbers obtained from the EXAFS analysis (more
details presented in the Supporting information, see Figs. S5 and
S6) provide an indication of the Pt particle size, and Table 1 sum-
marizes the coordination numbers of the Pt/Al2O3 and PtASn/
Al2O3 catalysts. From the Fourier transforms, it can be concluded
that no peak is present corresponding to a PtAO shell in any of
the samples, indicating that there are no detectable oxygen atoms
in the first coordination shell of Pt in the catalyst. This confirms the
complete reduction of Pt in all the samples. A PtAPt coordination
number of N = 7.7 in the Pt/Al2O3 catalyst indicates that if the cat-
alyst is predominantly homogeneous, there are 5055 atoms in the
Pt nanocluster [12,23]. It is clear that the addition of Sn decreases
the particle size of the Pt nanoclusters as lower coordination num-
bers are obtained for the PtASn/Al2O3 catalyst material. Moreover,
for the PtASn/Al2O3 catalyst, it is necessary to introduce another
coordination shell, namely PtASn, at similar distances as the PtAPt
first shell (R = 2.76 Å) to obtain a good fit to the data. The presence
of this PtASn coordination shell is evidence for the existence of a
PtASn alloy in the catalyst.
From Table 1, it can be concluded that the Pt particle size in-
creases throughout the whole experiment for the Pt/Al2O3 catalyst.
This is also observed for the PtASn/Al2O3 catalyst, which also
shows an increase in the degree of PtASn alloying after more dehy-
drogenationregeneration cycles. But it is clear that the presence of
Sn results in a decrease in the particle size of the Pt when com-
pared to the Pt/Al2O3 catalyst system. Moreover, in the PtASn/
Al2O3 catalyst after 1 and 10 cycles, the PtASn entities differ in
the amount of Sn in the alloy and a progressive Sn enrichment is
observed.
In order to determine the distribution of Pt and Sn in the bime-
tallic structure for the PtASn/Al2O3 catalyst at the different stages:
fresh, after 1 and 10 cycles, a series of models were created where
the influence of the bimetal distribution on the coordination num-
ber for the first two coordination shells was examined. These sim-
ulations helped us to propose possible particle morphologies based
on the EXAFS. They are summarized in Table 2. The EXAFS results
suggest the formation of 11 atom semispherical-like nanoparticles,
for the fresh PtASn/Al2O3 catalyst, which is poor in Sn. More spe-
cifically, the Sn atoms are located at the surface of these Pt nano-
particle entities. After one dehydrogenationregeneration cycle,
both the Pt nanoparticle size and the Sn content in the PtASn alloy
increase but this time resulting in the formation of a coreshell
type structure where Sn is located in the outer layer. However,
after 10 successive dehydrogenationregeneration cycles, not only
the number of Sn atoms increases, but also their dilution in the
whole Pt nanoparticles. These effects give rise to more homoge-
neous bimetallic entities.
3.3.2. CO-TPD IR analysis
The CO desorption curves shown in Fig. 4 indicate that the addi-
tion of Sn decreases the initial amount of CO adsorbed on the Pt
nanoparticles and also that these surface species desorb at lower
temperatures. To understand this observation, both particle size
and electronic effects have to be taken into account. As discussed
above, Sn decreases the Pt particle size and thus creates more cen-
ters on the surface available for CO adsorption. However, the lower
amount of CO observed here suggests that Sn partially covers those
centers as observed in our predicted models based on the EXAFS
analysis. On the other hand, Pt sites in the PtASn alloy are more
electron deficient since Sn draws electron density away from Pt.
Therefore, the adsorption properties of Pt are also modified by
the presence of Sn: the more electron-poor Pt species adsorb CO
more weakly and, as a consequence, COads species desorb at lower
temperatures. This is exactly what we observe in Fig. 4.
