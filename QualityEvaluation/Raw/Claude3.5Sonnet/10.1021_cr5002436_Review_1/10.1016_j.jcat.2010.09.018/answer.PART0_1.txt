The literature focuses mainly on platinum-based catalysts, particularly Pt and Pt-Sn systems supported on alumina, for the dehydrogenation of propane. It does not provide information on metal oxide-based catalysts like CrOx, gallium, indium, vanadium, zinc, and molybdenum oxides.

For the Pt-based catalysts discussed:

Composition: Pt/Al2O3 and PtSn/Al2O3 (with 0.5 wt% Pt and 1.5 wt% Sn)

Effectiveness: Pt catalysts show high initial activity but deactivate quickly due to coke formation. Addition of Sn improves catalyst stability, propene selectivity, and resistance to deactivation.

Industrial applications: The study uses conditions similar to industrial propane dehydrogenation reactors, indicating these catalysts are relevant for industrial processes.

Recent developments: The research presents detailed in-situ spectroscopic studies to understand catalyst behavior during multiple reaction-regeneration cycles, providing insights into deactivation mechanisms and Pt-Sn alloy formation.

Potential advantages: Pt-Sn catalysts show higher propene selectivity, better stability, and improved resistance to coking compared to Pt-only catalysts.

The literature does not provide information to compare these Pt-based catalysts with metal oxide catalysts for light olefin dehydrogenation.

该文献主要关注铂基催化剂，特别是以氧化铝为载体的Pt和Pt-Sn体系，用于丙烷脱氢反应。文中没有提供关于金属氧化物基催化剂（如CrOx、镓、铟、钒、锌和钼氧化物）的信息。

对于讨论的Pt基催化剂：

组成：Pt/Al2O3和PtSn/Al2O3（含0.5 wt% Pt和1.5 wt% Sn）

有效性：Pt催化剂显示出较高的初始活性，但由于积碳而快速失活。添加Sn可以改善催化剂的稳定性、丙烯选择性和抗失活能力。

工业应用：该研究使用类似于工业丙烷脱氢反应器的条件，表明这些催化剂与工业过程相关。

最新发展：该研究提供了详细的原位光谱研究，以了解催化剂在多个反应-再生循环过程中的行为，提供了关于失活机制和Pt-Sn合金形成的见解。

潜在优势：与纯Pt催化剂相比，Pt-Sn催化剂表现出更高的丙烯选择性、更好的稳定性和更强的抗积碳能力。

该文献没有提供信息来比较这些Pt基催化剂与金属氧化物催化剂在轻烯烃脱氢方面的性能。
