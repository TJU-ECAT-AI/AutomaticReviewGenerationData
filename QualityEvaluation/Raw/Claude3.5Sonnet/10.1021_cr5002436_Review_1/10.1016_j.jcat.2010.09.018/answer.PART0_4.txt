[1] "Pt-based catalysts have been widely used for alkane dehydrogenation reactions due to their excellent activity"

[2] "Sn is often added to alter the product distribution for hydrocarbon conversion through the inhibition of hydrogenolysis, isomerisation, cracking and coke formation, thereby enhancing the catalyst selectivity and stability"

[3] "The PtASn/Al2O3 catalyst possesses both a higher propane conversion and propene selectivity, which is maintained throughout the duration of the first dehydrogenation step."

[4] "Pt/Al2O3 catalyst exhibits a higher initial propane conversion than the PtASn/Al2O3 catalyst. However, the initial selectivity to propene is much lower (60%) when compared to the PtASn/Al2O3 catalyst (90%)"

The literature focuses primarily on platinum-based catalysts for light alkane dehydrogenation, particularly propane dehydrogenation. It does not discuss metal oxide-based catalysts like CrOx, gallium, indium, vanadium, zinc, and molybdenum oxides.

For platinum-based catalysts:

Composition: The study examines Pt/Al2O3 and PtSn/Al2O3 catalysts.

Effectiveness: Pt-based catalysts show excellent activity for alkane dehydrogenation. The addition of Sn improves selectivity and stability.

Industrial applications: These catalysts are used for propane dehydrogenation to produce propene, an important chemical intermediate.

Recent developments: The study investigates the effects of adding Sn to Pt catalysts, showing improved propene selectivity and catalyst stability.

Potential advantages: PtSn catalysts demonstrate higher propene selectivity and better resistance to deactivation compared to Pt-only catalysts.

The literature does not provide information to compare these platinum-based catalysts with metal oxide-based catalysts for light olefin dehydrogenation.
