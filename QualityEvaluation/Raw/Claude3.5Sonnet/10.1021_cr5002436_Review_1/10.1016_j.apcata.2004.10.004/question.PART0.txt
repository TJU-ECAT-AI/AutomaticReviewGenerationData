Abstract
In this work, well defined alumina and silica supported Pt and PtSn catalysts were prepared by surface organometallic reactions and were
characterized by TEM, XPS and EXAFS. These catalysts were tested in the catalytic dehydrogenation of isobutane. XPS results show that tin
is found under the form of Sn(0) and Sn(II,IV), being the percentage of Sn(0) lower for alumina supported than for silica supported catalysts.
Tin modified platinum catalysts, always show a decrease of approximately 1 eVin the BE of Pt, what would be indicative of an electron charge
transfer from tin to platinum. When the concentration of Sn(0) is high enough, in our case Sn(0)/Pt  0.3, EXAFS experiments demonstrated
the existence of a PtSn alloy diluting metallic Pt atoms, for both PtSn/g-Al2O3 and PtSn/SiO2. This PtSn alloy seems to be not active in the
dehydrogenation reaction; however, it is very important for selectivity and stability, inhibiting cracking and coke formation reactions. The
ensemble of our catalytic, XPS and EXAFS results, show that bimetallic PtSn/g-Al2O3 catalysts, prepared via SOMC/M techniques, can be
submitted to several sequential reactionregeneration cycles, recovering the same level of initial activity each time and that the nature of the
catalytic surface remains practically without modifications.

1. Introduction
Light olefins are widely employed in industry, as they are
involved in processes such as production of polymers,
ethers, nitriles, new gasolines, etc. Most of these olefins are
obtained as by-products of both thermal and catalytic
cracking processes, and so, the volume of gasoline requi-
red by the market determines the availability of olefins.
The deficit is covered at the present time by means of the
catalytic dehydrogenation of light paraffins.
The dehydrogenation of light paraffins to olefins is an
endothermic reaction; that it is why it requires the
application
of
relatively
severe
operation
conditions
(temperature above 500 8C in the case of isobutane). Under
these conditions, mono and bimetallic catalytic systems
based on Pt/g-Al2O3 lead to undesirable reactions, such as
the formation of light cracking and isomerization products
and coke deposits, all of them responsible for the loss
of selectivity and activity of the catalysts. This kind of

deactivation is reversible and the regeneration of the solid
can be carried out by burning the coke formed under
controlled conditions. In each regeneration cycle, the
temperature reaches a value high enough so as to cause
sintering of the metallic phase and, in the case of
multimetallic catalysts, the segregation of the metals can
also take place, causing an irreversible deactivation of the
catalyst [1,2].
Pt/g-Al2O3 catalysts are active in the paraffins dehy-
drogenation process, but they deactivate very quickly and
have a poor selectivity towards olefins, mainly caused by the
existence of cracking and isomerization reactions. Cracking
reactions are promoted by metallic active sites, while
isomerization reactions not only are activated on these sites,
but also on the acid sites of the support. It has been shown
that the addition of alkaline and alkaline-earth ions to
g-Al2O3 selectively poisons the isomerization active sites,
without affecting the dehydrogenation capacity of the
catalytic systems [35].
The addition of tin to Pt/g-Al2O3 catalysts notably
increases the stability and selectivity for dehydrogenation of
paraffins to olefins, inhibiting cracking and isomerization
reactions and coke formation process [2,3,69]. Tin is said to
act to modify platinum by an ensemble effect, decreasing
the number of contiguous platinum atoms, dividing the
platinum surface into smaller ensembles; in this way hydro-
genolysis and deactivation by coke deposition are drastically
reduced. A second effect is of an electronic nature: the
presence of tin changes the electronic environment of
platinum atoms [912].
The accurate nature of PtSn systems is very complicated
and still a matter of debate, but any proper explanation of the
role of tin in PtSn/g-Al2O3 catalysts is necessarily related to
the oxidation state of tin. The state of tin depends on catalyst
preparation, metal loadings, Sn/Pt ratio, support and acti-
vation treatments [3,1117], therefore contradictory results
are not surprising. To completely characterize the electronic
state of the metals, their geometrical array and the nature
of the interaction between them, it becomes necessary to
employ sophisticated analytical techniques, such as XPS,
Mo
ssbauer spectroscopy and EXAFS. EXAFS spectroscopy
gives information about the surroundings of the absorber
atom. In the particular case of Pt, the study of the L3
absorption edge measuring the transmission of X-rays,
provides information about the kind, number and distance of
neighbors around the Pt atoms.
Results published by Dautzemberg et al. [18] in the n-
hexane conversion reaction, indicate that the bimetallic
catalyst contains isolated Pt particles, together with Pt- and
Sn-rich alloys; PtSn alloys are supposed to be responsible
for the inhibition of the reactions taking place on active sites
composed of a relatively high number of platinum atoms,
whereas dehydrogenation reactions (which can proceed over
small ensembles of Pt atoms) are not affected. XPS results
obtained on PtSn/g-Al2O3 catalysts show that an important
proportion of tin is present under a ionic state, contrary to
what
happens
with
silica-supported
catalysts,
where
important quantities of Sn(0) can be formed [19]. Other
study, carried out by Lieske and Vo
lter, concluded that in a
series of PtSn/g-Al2O3 catalysts, the major part of tin was
present as Sn(II,IV), being this state stabilized by alumina
[20]. Merlen et al. found that bimetallic PtSn phases
supported on g-Al2O3 are more easily obtained for larger
particles than for small ones [7]. These authors suggested
that the metallic particles may be too small to stabilize tin in
the metallic state and tin probably migrates onto the support
remaining in ionic state in the vicinity of the particle. Based
on Mo
ssbauer spectroscopy and XRD data for supported
PtSn catalysts, Li et al. found that Sn(0) is alloyed with Pt
[21]. Cortright et al., using Mo
ssbauer spectroscopy for the
characterization of PtSn/SiO2 catalyst, observed a single
dominant peak at a chemical shift of 1.83 mm/s which they
assigned to the presence of Sn(0) alloyed with platinum [10].
PtSn/C catalysts were studied by EXAFS by Roma
n-
Mart
nez et al. [15]; the authors observed the presence of
bimetallic PtSn phases, Pt particles, and PtOSn2+ species,
suggesting that the catalytic activity of bimetallic catalysts is
determined by the relative concentration of these surface
species and their distribution in the support.
The influence of the preparation procedure is well
depicted in a paper of Ve
rtes et al., who studied by
Mo
ssbauer spectroscopy a series of PtSn/g-Al2O3 catalysts
prepared via Surface Organometallic Chemistry on Metals
(SOMC/M) techniques reacting Sn(C2H5)4 on Pt/g-Al2O3
and by a conventional procedure, impregnating Pt/g-Al2O3
with a SnCl2 solution [13]. Their results showed that while
as a consequence of the first-mentioned procedure tin was
interacting with Pt in a superficial PtSnx alloy, the second
procedure gave rise to a catalyst where the major part of tin
was in an ionic state. The difference in the catalytic surface
is correlated with a different catalytic behavior, as it was
demonstrated in a previous work carried out by our research
group in the isobutane dehydrogenation, where we presented
some results indicating that PtSn/g-Al2O3 prepared via
SOMC/M gave a better yield to isobutene than bimetallic
catalysts prepared using conventional impregnation proce-
dures [8]. Besides, when the metals are introduced by
coimpregnation of H2PtCl6 and SnCl2, the resulting catalyst
did not show good regenerability properties [1]. On the other
hand, when bimetallic catalysts are prepared by SOMC/M
techniques, the nature of the active phase formed can be
accurately controlled leading to more selective catalysts
that, in addition, can be regenerated, recovering the initial
activity of the fresh catalysts [22]. This last characteristic of
PtSn catalysts is a very important one, for even though Sn is
an efficient promoter employed in industrial catalysts,
deactivation due to coke is not completely eliminated and
the catalysts still exhibit short lifetimes and it is necessary to
submit them to continuous regeneration to maintain activity.
In this paper we use XPS and EXAFS to examine
the evolution of the electronic state and the local structures
of Pt and Sn in PtSn catalysts submitted to several

reactionregeneration cycles in the isobutane dehydrogena-
tion reaction. The aim of this work is to obtain accurate
evidences concerning the nature and the stability of the
active sites obtained when SOMC/M preparation techniques
are employed.
2. Experimental
2.1. Catalyst preparation
A commercial g-Al2O3 (Cyanamid Ketjen) crushed to a
size of 60100 mesh and a Degussa silica (Aerosil 200,
200 m2 g1) were used as supports. For the preparation of
the platinum monometallic catalysts a solution of H2PtCl6
was added onto the g-Al2O3 and a solution of [Pt(NH3)4]2+
was added on functionalized silica. In both cases the
solution had a concentration so as to obtain 1% (w/w) Pt
exchanged on the support. Then, the solids were repeatedly
washed, dried at 105 8C, calcined in air at 500 8C and
reduced in flowing H2 at the same temperature, leading to
the monometallic Pt/g-Al2O3 and Pt/SiO2 catalysts. After
the reduction step, the Pt/g-Al2O3 catalyst was washed
several
times
with
NH3
solution
(0.1 M)
at
room
temperature, in order to obtain a chlorine concentration
under 0.1% in the resulting solid. The bimetallic systems
have been prepared by reaction between the monometallic
catalyst and different quantities of SnBu4 dissolved in
n-heptane, maintaining a H2 flow of 30 cm3 min1 and a
temperature of 90 8C during the reaction time, for the
catalysts with Sn/Pt ratios up to 0.4. In the preparation of
the catalysts with higher tin contents, n-decane was used as
solvent and the reaction temperature was 150 8C. After 4 h
of reaction, the systems were cooled to room temperature
and were repeatedly washed with n-heptane under a H2
atmosphere. This preparation procedure gives rise to an
organometallic supported phase, which retains on the
platinum surface part of the butyl groups of the SnBu4. The
elimination of the organic groups heating the solids in a H2
atmosphere at 500 8C, generates the supported bimetallic
catalysts PtSn. Platinum and tin contents were determined
by atomic absorption spectrometry.
2.2. Characterization
2.2.1. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM)
The size distribution of metallic particles was determined
by using a Jeol 2010 instrument. To estimate the mean
particle size (dva) the particles were considered spherical and
the second moment of the distribution was employed.
2.2.2. Temperature programmed reduction (TPR)
The catalysts was performed by means of a conventional
equipment using a programmable furnace and the response
was measured using a thermal conductivity detector. The
composition of the feed flow was H2/N2 = 1/9 and the
heating rate was 10 8C min1 from room temperature to
800 8C.
2.2.3. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS)
The samples were re-reduced in situ in the pre-treatment
chamber of the spectrometer. The spectra were obtained with
a VG ESCALAB 200R spectrometer equipped with a
hemispherical electron analyzer and a Mg Ka 120 W X-ray
source. The reduction treatment was carried out in situ, by
heating the fresh and postreaction samples under a hydrogen
flow at 500 8C for 1 h. As internal standard, for alumina
supported catalysts binding energy (BE) of the Al 2p peak at
74.5 eV and for silica supported catalysts the C 1s peak at
284.6 eV, were taken. The intensities were estimated by
calculating the integral of each peak after subtraction of the
S-shaped background and fitting the experimental peak to a
Lorentzian/Gaussian mix of variable proportion.
2.2.4. X-ray absorption spectroscopy
The X-ray absorption spectra were measured at the XAS
beam line at the National Synchrotron Light Laboratory
(LNLS), Campinas, Brazil. The EXAFS spectra of the Pt L3-
edge (11.6 keV) were recorded at room temperature using a
Si(1 1 1) crystal monochromator in the range 11 460
12 600 eV in transmission mode. Samples were sealed in H2
atmosphere in special sample holders with kapton windows
in order to avoid contact with air and were measured in that
condition.
The EXAFS data were extracted from the measured
absorption spectra by standard methods [23,24]. Raw data
files were averaged and the preedge region was approxi-
mated by a polynomial curve. Normalization was completed
dividing by the height of the absorption edge and the
background was subtracted using cubic spline routines. The
main contributions to the spectra were isolated on the
Fourier transforms of the final EXAFS functions. The phase
shifts and the amplitude functions for PtPt and PtSn pairs
were calculated using the FEFF [25] program from the
metallic Pt and PtSn alloy structure [26].
2.3. Activity measurements
The test reaction was the isobutane dehydrogenation.
Activity test was performed by placing the sample in a
conventional flow reactor at atmospheric pressure and
550 8C. The temperature of the reactor was raised to 550 8C
with a heating rate of 10 8C min1 under H2 flow. This
condition was mantained for 2 h, and then the reactor was
fed with a mixture of H2 and isobutane with a ratio H2/
isobutane = 3 and a total gas flow of 50 cm3 min1. The
composition of the reaction products was analyzed using a
Carlo Erba Fractovap series 2150 gas chromatograph on line
with the reactor (tricresyl phosphate on Chromosorb W
column). In all the tests, conversion was kept below 10% to
assure kinetic control conditions (equilibrium conversion for
these experimental conditions is around 55%).

Catalysts were submitted to a series of reaction
regeneration cycles. Coke deposit on fresh samples was
carried out by means of a 4.5 h isobutane dehydrogenation
reaction run, under the following conditions: atmospheric
pressure, 550 8C and a feed flow of pure isobutane of
50 cm3 min1. Then, the hydrocarbon feeding was replaced
by an inert steam (Ar), simultaneously cooling the reactor up
to 250 8C. Once this temperature has been reached, Ar was
replaced by an air flow and the temperature was raised up to
550 8C, with a heating rate of 5 8C min1. After 1 h under
this condition, the samples were cooled to room tempera-
ture, and kept that way overnight. In this way, samples are
ready to be use in a new cycle.
3. Results
Table 1 shows the composition and the nomenclature of
the catalysts investigated in the present study. The synthesis
of bimetallic catalysts can be represented by the following
global reaction:
Pt=support  ySnBu4  1
2y H2 ) PtSny=support  4yBuH
(1)
The reaction between the monometallic Pt catalysts and
SnBu4 was followed by gas chromatography, which per-
mitted to establish the total reagent consumption, and con-
sequently, the y value that appears in reaction (1). In order to
study the specificity of the interaction between the mono-
metallic Pt catalysts and SnBu4, blank experiments were
conducted, in which SnBu4 was contacted with the support
(g-Al2O3 or SiO2). No detectable tin amounts on the support
were observed.
Table 2 presents the results of TEM, TPR and XPS
analysis performed on the catalysts studied. TEM results
show a narrow distribution of metallic particle sizes, with a
mean particle size between 1.8 and 2.2 nm for alumina
supported catalysts and between 2.4 and 2.9 nm for the silica
supported ones. These values are indicating a high
dispersion of the alumina supported catalysts (around
60%) and that the silica supported ones have a relatively
lower dispersion (around 45%). The particle size distribution
of
the
bimetallic
systems
are
quite
similar
to
the
corresponding monometallic ones, presenting only a small
shift (0.20.5 nm) compatible with a selective deposition of
tin over platinum, in agreement with previously reported
results involving these kind of preparation procedures
[27,28]. PtSnA1.6 submitted to four reactionregeneration
cycles presented a mean particle size of only 0.1 nm higher
than PtSnA1.6 fresh catalyst; this value indicates the
absence of sintering phenomena. TPR diagrams show two
main peaks of hydrogen consumption, in the regions of 75
110 and 360440 8C, assigned to a weak and a strong metal
support interaction, respectively [29].
XPS results show that platinum is completely reduced in
all the samples studied, because the spectra contain only one
peak corresponding to Pt centered around 71 eV (Pt 4f7/2)

and 314 eV (Pt 4d5/2), for silica and alumina supported
catalysts, respectively. The references values were taken
from the NIST X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy database
[30]. In tin modified systems, a downward shift of ca. 1 eVin
the binding energy of platinum was observed with respect to
the corresponding monometallic catalysts. Concerning tin
oxidation state, the Sn 3d5/2 peak obtained by XPS contains
two contributions (Fig. 1). The first with a binding energy of
around 484 eV is assigned to Sn(0) according to the well
determined values obtained by Rodriguez et al. (484.9 eV)
[31]; the second contribution corresponds to Sn(II,IV), with
a binding energy centered around 487 eV [30]. Results
obtained for the fraction of metallic tin with respect to total
tin (Sn(0)/SnTOTAL) and Sn(0)/Pt ratio are also presented in
Table 2. Fresh alumina supported bimetallic catalysts
showed a Sn(0)/SnTOTAL ratio between 0.2 and 0.4, whereas
for silica supported catalysts this ratio is between 0.6 and
0.7. XPS analysis of PtSnA1.6 postreaction sample showed,
with regard to Pt and Sn, that the nature of the bimetallic
phase is not appreciably modified after four cycles of
reactionregeneration.
PtSnA0.4 and PtSnA1.6 were studied by EXAFS in order
to determine the local structure around Pt atoms. PtSnA1.6
sample was also studied after four reactionregeneration
cycles to observe how the clusters were modified by the
treatments and to study the stability of the catalyst. Fig. 2
shows the Pt L3-edge k2-weighted EXAFS functions (left) and
their corresponding k2-weighted Fourier transforms (right) of
PtO2 and Pt foil used as references. For comparison purpose,
PtSnS0.7 sample was also studied. Fig. 3 shows the Pt L3
EXAFS spectra offresh PtSnA0.4 and PtSnA1.6 catalysts and
that of PtSnS0.7. From the Fourier transforms it can be seen
that no peak is present in the position corresponding to a PtO
shell in any sample, indicating that there are no oxygen atoms
in the first coordination shells of Pt in the catalysts. This
confirms the complete reduction of Pt in all samples, in
agreementwith XPS results. Great differences are observed in
the spectra corresponding to the two fresh samples supported
on g-Al2O3. PtSnA0.4 has a spectrum similar to that of Pt foil
having one peak at 2.6 A
 in the Fourier transform (without
phase correction) showing that Pt is completely reduced
forming metallic clusters and no other Pt phase would be
present. The EXAFS spectrum PtSnA1.6 shows differences to
that of Pt foil and two peaks are clearly seen in the Fourier
transform at 2.0 and 2.5 A
 (without phase correction) what
could be indicating that two types of scatterers atoms are

present in the first coordination shells of Pt atoms. Something
similar is observed for PtSnS0.7. As it can be observed in
Fig. 3, the only difference between PtSnS0.7 and PtSnA1.6 is
the height of the peaks, which could be indicating differences
in the average coordination numbers of the two different
scatterers around Pt.
Fig. 4 shows the EXAFS spectra and their corresponding
Fourier transforms of the PtSnA1.6 catalyst after one and
four reactionregeneration cycles. No large differences are
observed in the Fourier transforms of these samples after the
reactionregeneration cycles and it can be seen that the
spectra are similar to that of the fresh sample showing two
peaks in their Fourier transforms with a slight change in the
intensity of the peaks.
To quantitatively analyze these data, the main peaks of
each transform were analyzed by a standard fitting
procedure [32]. In this way, the distance R, the coordination
number N and the DebyeWaller factor for each shell were
obtained. Two shells were used in the fits of all samples,
one corresponding to a PtSn coordination and the other to a
PtPt coordination. The phase shifts and the amplitude
functions for PtPt and PtSn shells were calculated using
the FEFF program [25] using the PtSn alloy structure [26].
Figs. 5 and 6 shows the fits performed in R-space of the
experimental data. Table 3 shows the results from the
EXAFS analysis performed on the Fourier transforms in the
range k = 1.63.0 A
 . It is observed that in the fresh PtSnA0.4
catalyst (with Sn/Pt = 0.4 and Sn(0)/Pt = 0.16) only one
shell of Pt atoms was needed to fit the experimental data with
an average coordination number of 9. For the fresh catalysts
with higher tin contents (PtSnA1.6 and PtSnS0.7; Sn(0)/
Pt = 0.35 and 0.46, respectively) two coordination shells are
found around Pt atoms. One shell corresponds to Sn atoms
and the other one to Pt atoms. The presence of the PtSn
coordination shell is an evidence of the existence of a PtSn
alloy in the catalysts. The PtPt coordination can be
produced by the same PtSn alloy or by small Pt clusters not

alloyed to Sn. It is seen that through the regeneration
processes the PtSn shell is present in the catalyst showing
the stability of the alloy. There is a small decrease in the
coordination number on the PtSn pair after the fourth
regeneration cycle while the PtPt coordination number
increases, although the change is small and could be
included in the experimental error.
As a test method, the catalysts studied in this work were
submitted to the dehydrogenation reaction of isobutane to
isobutene. Table 4 summarizes the results of activity and
selectivity obtained after 4 h on stream, with a feed of H2/
isobutane: 3/1. It must be indicated that the selectivity to
isobutene for the monometallic catalysts is very low, due to
the formation of cracking and isomerization products. The
addition of small quantities of tin notably modifies this
selectivity by a strong inhibition of cracking reactions. As
well as cracking reactions, isomerization reactions are also
catalyzed by metallic active sites, nevertheless, the most
important active sites for these reactions are the acid sites of
the support. g-Al2O3 has acid sites that are stronger than
those of SiO2, that is why the silica supported bimetallic
catalysts present a higher selectivity to isobutene (>99% for
PtSnS0.4). When g-Al2O3 is employed as support, its
modification by the addition of alkaline or alkaline-earth ions
allows to obtain the same level of selectivity to isobutene as
with silica, as it has been reported in previous works of our
group [5,22].
From the values of reaction rate presented in Table 4, it
can be concluded that monometallic catalysts are more
active than the bimetallic ones. The difference observed
between PtA and PtS can be assigned to the higher
dispersion of the alumina supported catalyst.
The catalytic performance of the alumina supported PtSn
systems can be analyzed as a function of the amount of tin
added. Taking the reaction rate of PtA as reference, an initial
addition of tin causes a diminution in the reaction rate. Then,
as Sn/Pt ratio increases, the reaction rate increases and
passes through a maximum for Sn/Pt between 0.4 and 0.8.
The values for the reaction rate for silica supported
bimetallic catalysts studied in this work (PtSnS0.4 and
PtSnS0.7), are in the region where the reaction rate
decreases with Sn/Pt ratio.
One of the most important requirements for these
catalysts is their stability and regenerability. Previous
studies carried out with Pt/g-Al2O3 under the same
conditions stated in Table 4, showed that this system lost
approximately 50% of its initial activity after 4 h on stream,
while bimetallic PtSn/g-Al2O3 showed only a slight
diminution of its activity after 8 h under reaction [3,8].
With the aim of verifying if this behavior could be observed
under more severe conditions, we tested the stability and
regenerability of PtSnA0.4 and PtSnA1.6 feeding the reactor
with pure isobutane; for these conditions, the deactivation is
accelerated. To quantify the deactivation of the catalysts, an
activity coefficient (a) is defined as the ratio between the
reaction rate at time t on stream and the initial reaction rate
for the fresh catalyst. Fig. 7 displays the variation of the
activity coefficient as a function of time on stream. As it can

be seen, the addition of tin notably enhances the stability of
the catalysts. Also, this figure shows that the catalysts can be
regenerated, recovering the activity level of the fresh
sample. This means that the nature of the active phase is
recovered after each reactionregeneration cycle, in agree-
ment with the XPS and EXAFS results found for fresh and
postreaction PtSnA1.6 sample.
4. Discussion
Results obtained by TPR, XPS and EXAFS clearly
established the complete reduction of platinum in mono and
bimetallic catalysts, both for silica and alumina supports.
Blank experiments demonstrated that, under the reaction
conditions employed in the preparation of tin modified
catalysts using SOMC/M techniques, tin was not detectable
on the support. After the activation step at 500 8C in a H2
flow, butyl groups are completely eliminated and the
bimetallic catalyst is obtained [28,33]. In this case, XPS
demonstrated the existence of ionic tin, whose origin may be
assigned to the migration of part of the tin, initially deposited
onto the platinum via the reaction with SnBu4, to the
platinumsupport interface where it could be forming
aluminate or silicate, as it has been observed for RhSn, for
instance [27]. The XPS Sn(0)/SnTOTAL ratio is lower for
alumina supported than for silica supported catalysts (Table
2). In silica supported catalysts, the percentage of Sn(0) is
about 6070%, despite the concentration of tin in the
sample, whereas for alumina supported catalysts this
percentage is under 40%. In this latter systems, the
contribution of Sn(0) diminishes with increasing global
Sn/Pt ratio, causing that even for PtSnA1.6, Sn(0)/Pt ratio
does not exceed a value of 0.35. This behavior can be surely
related to the higher surface activity of alumina compared to
silica, which would result in a more favorable condition to
the formation of the above mentioned tin aluminate
compounds. The higher dispersion of PtA catalyst, also
favors the formation of these compounds, due to the higher
platinumsupport interface.
Concerning the downwards shift of approximately 1 eV
observed in the BE of Pt in all the bimetallic catalysts
studied, it would be indicative of the existence of an
electronic effect of tin over platinum, in agreement with
previously
published
results
for
PtSn/SiO2
catalysts
prepared by Stagg et al. [2]. Studies carried out by Shen
et al. from quantum chemical calculations employing
density functional theories (DFT) for Pt19 and Pt16Sn3
clusters indicate that tin donates electrons to the 6sp and 5d
orbitals of platinum [34]. Rodr
guez et al. investigated
platinumtin surface alloys using synchrotron-based high
resolution photoemission and ab initio self consistent field
calculations and concluded that PtSn bond involves a
Sn(5s,5p) ! Pt(6s,6p) charge transfer together with a
Pt(5d) ! Pt(6s,6p) rehybridization [31,35]. In this same
sense, in a previous study of a PtSn/SiO2 system by Pt-L2,3
XANES, the existence of an electronic effect was also
explained by means of the d ! s, p rehybridization process
taking place in PtSn three-dimensional small nanoclusters
leading to an increase in the number of Pt 5d holes [36].
The EXAFS profiles of PtSnA0.4 and PtSnA1.6 samples
exhibit some differences (Fig. 3). The catalyst with the
lowest tin content (PtSnA0.4) has a spectrum similar to that
of Pt foil, presenting a decrease of the average coordination
number with respect to the Pt bulk that indicates the small
size of the metallic clusters. When small particles are
analyzed by EXAFS, the average coordination number fitted
from the spectra is smaller than that of the bulk, because of
the high proportion of atoms in the surface. A simple model
can be used to estimate the size of these clusters supposing
spherical shape. Fig. 8 shows the average coordination
number of ideal spherical Pt clusters as a function of the
radius of the cluster. It is seen that the average coordination
number increases rapidly for small particles and approaches
asymptotically the value of the bulk, which is 12. From this
curve, the size of the clusters in our sample can be estimated
using the fitted coordination number. The obtained radius of
the clusters is between 8 and 10 A
 . For the fresh catalysts
PtSnA1.6 and PtSnS0.7 two coordination shells are found
around Pt atoms. One shell corresponds to Sn atoms and the
other one to Pt atoms, being the presence of the PtSn
coordination shell an evidence of the existence of a PtSn
alloy in the catalysts. The PtPt coordination can be
produced by the same PtSn alloy or by small Pt clusters not
alloyed to Sn. The information obtained from the EXAFS
fits permits to know the structural characteristics of the
bimetallic clusters that Pt and Sn atoms are forming in the
catalyst. As it has been reported that PtSn and Pt3Sn are the
most abundant alloys in PtSn bimetallic systems [37] we
will consider these two alloys in our analysis. In Pt3Sn, Pt
atoms have 12 first-neighbors Pt and 4 first-neighbors Sn at a
distance of 2.828 A
 [38]. If the structure present in our
catalyst were this type of alloy one would expect a relation of
Pt and Sn atoms in the first coordination of 3 to 1. This is
clearly not the case from our fits. Moreover, the distances are
not equal for the two types of atoms as in the alloy. Thus, we
would not expect our bimetallic particles over g-Al2O3 and
over SiO2 to have the structure of this alloy. In contrast, in
G.J. Siri et al. / Applied Catalysis A: General 278 (2005) 239249
246
Fig. 8. Average coordination number of Pt atoms for spherical Pt clusters.
PtSn alloy, Pt has two Pt atoms at 2.72 A
 and six Sn atoms at
2.73 A
 . In this case one would expect a coordination number
relation for Pt and Sn of 1:3. This is closer to the relation
found in our case. However, the distances for each
coordination shell are inverted. That is, Sn atoms are closer
than Pt atoms in our samples, contrary to what happens in the
alloy, though differences are small. This can be understood
in terms of the coexistence of two different phases in the
catalyst: a PtSn alloy and some unalloyed Pt particles. The
unalloyed Pt phase would contribute to the PtPt shell
increasing both its coordination number and its distance (the
distance of PtPt pairs in the bulk is 2.77 A
 ). This would also
explain why the relation between coordination numbers for
the shells PtPt and PtSn is not 1:3 as expected for the PtSn
alloy. In addition, Borgna et al. [39] have shown that the
presence of the peak at 2.15 A
found in our radial
distribution function is not only a fingerprint for PtSn
interactions, but also the evidence of the existence of
unalloyed Pt. The decrease of the average coordination
number from that of the bulk can be explained because of the
small size of the clusters having an important contribution
from atoms on the surface.
The coexistence of an unalloyed metallic Pt phase
can be confirmed considering the quantity of Pt and
Sn atoms in the PtSnA1.6 and PtSnS0.7 catalysts. Taking
into account XPS results that show that the Sn(0)/Pt  0.3
0.5, there are between twice and three times more Pt atoms
than Sn atoms available to form the alloy. In this analysis
we have considered the simplest configuration which is
consistent with our results. Of course, one cannot rule
out the coexistence of different alloys with different Pt/Sn
ratios. However, even if that was the case, the most
important conclusion from this analysis is the coexistence
of a PtSn alloy with some segregated metallic Pt. As
the stoichiometry of the alloy is PtSn (ratio Sn/Pt = 1),
the rest of Pt atoms should be segregated forming small
metallic clusters as no other type of scatterer is found in
our EXAFS results indicating that there is no other Pt
phases present.
EXAFS fits do not show evidence of changes in the
structure around Pt atoms after the different regeneration
cycles. From the results shown in Table 3 it can be seen that
the Pt and Sn shells are present after one and four reaction
regeneration cycles and the quantity and distance of both
scatterers around Pt atoms are kept almost unchanged. A
small variation in the coordination numbers is observed after
four regeneration cycles but this difference could be
included in the experimental error. These results are a clear
evidence of the stability of the alloy and the metallic Pt
phase in the catalysts.
The absence of PtSn alloy in the PtSnA0.4 catalyst can
be also explained in terms of the quantity of Sn available to
form the alloy. XPS results show that approximately 60% of
Sn atoms are ionic, having only ca. 40% of Sn atoms
available to form the alloy, which leads to a Sn(0)/Pt ratio of
approximately 0.15. That is, there are approximately seven
times Pt atoms than Sn atoms to form the alloy. In this way, if
some alloy were present it would contribute with less than
15% of the total EXAFS signal and could not be resolved.
A study of dehydrogenation of isobutane for all the
catalysts was preformed, under the conditions indicated in
the experimental section. Tin modified Pt catalysts showed
an important inhibition of cracking reactions, which is a
structure sensitive reaction, a result that can be assigned to
the destruction of platinum ensembles caused by the
presence of metallic tin [24,710]. The inhibiting effect of
tin is observed even for the catalysts with low Sn/Pt ratio, as
it arises from the data presented in Table 4. For instance, for
PtSnA1.6 (Sn(0)/Pt = 0.35) and PtSnS0.4 (Sn(0)/Pt = 0.28),
the selectivity to cracking products is under 1%. EXAFS
results revealed that, when the Sn(0)/Pt ratio increases, it
appears a PtSn alloy, which would be responsible for the
destruction of the platinum active sites leading to cracking
reactions. In this sense, the alloy behaves in a way similar to
that of isolated Sn(0).
The direct dehydrogenation of light paraffins is carried
out under severe operating conditions favorable to the
deactivation of the catalysts by sintering and/or coke
formation (high temperatures, low H/C ratio). TEM data of
the studied catalysts led to the conclusion that, under the
experimental conditions employed here, sintering deactiva-
tion mechanism is not important, because the mean particle
size of the fresh and postreaction samples are about the
same. As an example, see the data for PtSnA1.6 in Table 2.
Thus, coke formation is surely the main deactivation process
that takes place during the dehydrogenation reaction. In Fig.
7, it is depicted how the activity coefficient diminishes as a
function of time for PtA, PtSnA0.4 and PtSnA1.6 catalysts,
being the deactivation lower for the sample with the highest
Sn/Pt ratio. This is in agreement with the fact that tin
provokes a notably diminution in the quantity of coke
deposited during the dehydrogenation reaction, as has been
previously demonstrated [8]. The coke formation process is
favored by reactions that, the same as the cracking reactions,
are structure sensitive; that is why the decrease of the size of
platinum ensembles, either by isolated Sn(0) or by PtSn
alloy, enhances the stability of the catalytic system. The
electronic modifications introduced by the presence of tin,
also promote the stability of the bimetallic systems, by
inhibiting coke formation reactions. In fact, the increase of
the electronic density on the Pt atoms (observed by XPS)
causes the decrease of the interaction between coke
precursors and the active site, due to the repulsion electronic
effects leading to the diminution of adsorption energy of
these coke precursors. The addition of tin to Pt/SiO2
decreases the initial heat of isobutene adsorption from
185 kJ mol1 on Pt/SiO2 to 125 kJ mol1 on PtSn/SiO2.
Accordingly, the addition of tin to Pt/SiO2 appears to
suppress the decomposition of adsorbed olefins to more
highly dehydrogenated species. It has also been suggested
that tin favors the transport of coke from active sites to the
support on PtSn/g-Al2O3 catalysts [10].

An aspect to be highlighted related to PtSn/g-Al2O3
catalysts, is their stability facing successive reaction
regeneration cycles. The experimental points in Fig. 7
shows a marked reproducibility in the activity coefficient
values corresponding to different reactionregeneration
cycles, in agreement with the similarities found in the
nature of the fresh and postreaction phases, as measured by
XPS and EXAFS.
These results can surely be ascribed to the preparation
procedure employed, derived from SOMC/M. One plausible
explanation for the results presented in this paper could be
that as this preparation method generates such strong
interaction between Pt and Sn, well-defined bimetallic
phases are obtained, that are stable facing several reaction
regeneration cycles. Previously published results involving
PtSn/g-Al2O3 catalysts prepared using conventional meth-
ods showed that several deactivationregeneration cycles
decreased the activity of the catalysts [1,40].
The evolution of the bimetallic phases through the
different steps of preparation and activation, could be
represented by Scheme 1. As it was already presented, the
first step consisted of the reaction between SnBu4 and the
monometallic platinum catalyst in a H2 atmosphere and
temperatures between 90 and 150 8C. Upon reduction at
500 8C, the organic fragments are eliminated. Considering
the Sn/Pt atomic ratios employed in the present study, at the
end of the activation step, the active phase is determined by
the fraction of free metallic platinum forming clusters of
small dimensions, isolated by PtSn alloys.
In Fig. 9 the reaction rate values are depicted as a function
of the Sn(0)/Pt ratio. For all the studied catalysts there is a
diminution in the reaction rate as the Sn(0)/Pt increases.
Among the catalysts analyzed in this work, the one with the
highest Sn(0)/Pt ratio (PtSnS0.7, Sn(0)/Pt = 0.46) is the
system with the lowest reaction rate. For alumina supported
PtSn catalysts, the Sn(0)/Pt ratio varies with the amount of
tin added in a less pronounced way than for silica supported
catalysts (see Table 2) and, accordingly, the dehydrogena-
tion rate is less sensitive to the Sn/Pt ratio. Considering the
fundamental catalytic properties (activity, selectivity, stabi-
lity) as a whole, PtSnA1.6 catalyst (Sn/Pt = 1.6; Sn(0)/
Pt = 0.35) resulted the best system among those studied
here.
Taking into account the image of the surface represented
in Scheme 1, where small Pt clusters coexist with PtSn alloy,
and the catalytic results obtained, it seems reasonable to
accept that the PtSn alloy is not active in the dehydrogena-
tion reaction, or at least its activity level is notably lower
than that of Pt clusters. It is likely that PtSn alloy has the
mission of inhibiting cracking and coke formation reactions
and of cleaning the active phase, by favoring the
migration of highly dehydrogenated species to the support.
This last process might be helped by the presence of ionic tin
at the platinumsupport interface. The proportion of the
PtSn alloy must be kept relatively low with respect to non-
alloyed platinum, so that the dehydrogenation activity would
not be affected. Yining et al. studied the dehydrogenation of
n-butane with PtSn/g-Al2O3 catalysts, prepared by impreg-
nation with an aqueous solution of (H2PtCl6 + SnCl2) and
having a Sn/Pt ratio of 3 [1]. In agreement with the above
mentioned results, they observed that the dehydrogenation
activity of the catalyst was diminished with the increase in
the amount of the PtSn alloy in the course of several coking
regeneration cycles. Our catalytic, XPS and EXAFS results
show that bimetallic PtSn/g-Al2O3 catalysts, prepared via
SOMC/M techniques, can be submitted to several sequential
reactionregeneration cycles, recovering the same level of
initial activity each time. This fact could be assigned to the
close interaction between tin and platinum, leading to a well
defined active phase as it is shown in Scheme 1, avoiding in
this way the waste of the metal promoter that could play a
negative role after several reactionregeneration cycles.

drogenation of isobutane. The main conclusions can be
summarized as follows:
 XPS results show that in supported PtSn catalysts, tin
is found under the form of Sn(0) and Sn(II,IV). The
contribution of Sn(0) with respect to SnTOTAL is lower for
alumina supported than for silica supported catalysts. In
all tin modified platinum catalysts, our results show a
downwards shift of approximately 1 eV in the BE of Pt.
This fact would be indicative of the existence of an
electronic effect, suggesting that there is an electron
charge transfer from tin to platinum.
 EXAFS experiments in PtSn supported samples allow to
demonstrate the existence of a PtSn alloy diluting metallic
Pt atoms for the higher Sn(0)/Pt ratios, in our case
approximately 0.3. This PtSn alloy seems to be not active
in the dehydrogenation reaction, and would have the
mission of inhibiting cracking and coke formation reac-
tions and of cleaning the active phase. The proportion
of the PtSn alloy must be kept relatively low with respect
to non-alloyed platinum, so that the dehydrogenation
activity would not be affected.
 Catalytic, XPS and EXAFS results performed in this
work, show that bimetallic PtSn/g-Al2O3 catalysts,
prepared via SOMC/M techniques, can be submitted to
several sequential reactionregeneration cycles, recover-
ing the same level of initial activity each time and that the
nature of the catalytic surface remains practically without
modifications. This fact could be assigned to the close
interaction between tin and platinum, leading to a well
defined active phase, avoiding in this way the waste of
the metal promoter that could play a negative role after
several reactionregeneration cycles.
