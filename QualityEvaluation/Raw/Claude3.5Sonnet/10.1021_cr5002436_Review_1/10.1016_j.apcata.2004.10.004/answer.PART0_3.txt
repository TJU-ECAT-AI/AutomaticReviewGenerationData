The given literature does not contain information to compare and contrast noble metal-based catalysts (particularly Platinum) with metal oxide-based catalysts for the nonoxidative dehydrogenation of light olefins. The document focuses primarily on PtSn catalysts supported on alumina and silica for isobutane dehydrogenation. It does not discuss metal oxide catalysts such as CrOx, gallium, indium, vanadium, zinc, or molybdenum oxides. 

The literature provides details on the preparation, characterization, and performance of PtSn catalysts, including their stability over multiple reaction-regeneration cycles. However, it does not contain information to make comparisons with metal oxide catalysts in terms of compositions, effectiveness, industrial applications, recent developments, or potential advantages.

To properly answer this question would require additional sources covering metal oxide catalysts for light olefin dehydrogenation, which are not present in the given text.

给定的文献不包含比较和对比贵金属基催化剂(特别是铂)与金属氧化物基催化剂在轻烯烃非氧化脱氢方面的信息。该文档主要关注用于异丁烷脱氢的铝和二氧化硅支撑的PtSn催化剂。它没有讨论诸如CrOx、镓、铟、钒、锌或钼氧化物等金属氧化物催化剂。

该文献提供了PtSn催化剂的制备、表征和性能的详细信息,包括它们在多个反应-再生循环中的稳定性。然而,它不包含可以在成分、有效性、工业应用、最新发展或潜在优势方面与金属氧化物催化剂进行比较的信息。

要正确回答这个问题,需要额外的涵盖轻烯烃脱氢金属氧化物催化剂的资料,而这些资料在给定的文本中并不存在。
