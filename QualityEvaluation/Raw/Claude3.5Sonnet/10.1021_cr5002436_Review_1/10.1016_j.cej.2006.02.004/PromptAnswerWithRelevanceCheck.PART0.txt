Read the questions and answers provided below. First, critically assess the overall relevance of the answers provided to the set of questions asked.

If, upon your assessment, you find that the answers do not contain information that is relevant to the questions asked, stop your review process immediately and respond with a single sentence: "※※※※※※※The provided answers are not relevant to the questions.※※※※※※※". Do not provide any additional explanation or background information, only this sentence should be given as a response in case of irrelevant answers.

If, however, the answers are relevant to the questions asked, proceed to compile answers for each question according to the instructions below. Ensure to aggregate all the relevant answers from the multiple answer results provided in the document, and organize them sequentially by their order number, compiling the corresponding quotes, English answers, and Chinese answers for each question.

If the provided answers' quotes are not differentiated by question, ensure to break them down and assign the quotes to each respective question, outputting them separately within each question's section.

To provide a comprehensive review, differentiate the responses into quotes, English answers, and Chinese answers for each question based on the details given in the 'Answer' XML tags. Structure your review using the XML format showcased below if the answers are relevant to the questions asked:

<EnglishVersionAnswer>

The given literature does not contain information to answer this question. The document focuses on sodium-doped platinum catalysts supported on alumina for n-butane dehydrogenation. It does not discuss or compare other metal oxide catalysts like chromium, gallium, indium, vanadium, zinc or molybdenum oxides for light olefin dehydrogenation. The literature is limited to studying the effects of sodium addition on the acidity and metallic properties of Pt/Al2O3 catalysts, and does not provide information to compare different types of dehydrogenation catalysts as requested in the question.

The given literature does not contain information to compare and contrast noble metal-based catalysts (particularly Platinum) with metal oxide-based catalysts (such as CrOx, gallium, indium, vanadium, zinc, and molybdenum oxides) for nonoxidative dehydrogenation of light olefins. The document focuses solely on Pt-based catalysts supported on alumina, specifically discussing the effects of sodium doping on these catalysts for n-butane dehydrogenation. It does not mention or discuss metal oxide-based catalysts or provide information about their compositions, effectiveness, industrial applications, or recent developments in comparison to noble metal catalysts.
