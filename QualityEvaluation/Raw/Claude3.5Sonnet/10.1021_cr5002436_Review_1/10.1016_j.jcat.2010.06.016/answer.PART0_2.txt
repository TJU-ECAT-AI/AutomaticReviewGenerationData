[1] "Recent studies have shown that calcined hydrotalcites, referred to as Mg(Al)O, are good supports for Pt-based catalysts for the dehydrogenation of light alkanes to alkenes and hydrogen [19]."

[2] "High alkene selectivity, minimal coke formation, and better catalyst activity can be achieved by promoting Pt supported on Mg(Al)O or other supports with elements such as Sn, Ga, and Ge [9,1416,18]."

[3] "Pt/Mg(Ga)(Al)O catalysts prepared by the method described in Part I of this work leads to an active alkane dehydrogenation catalyst that is highly selective for the formation of ethene and propene from ethane and propane, respectively."

[4] "We have also shown that Pt/Mg(Ga)(Al)O catalysts exhibit lower deactivation and coke formation than conventional bimetallic catalysts, such as PtSn/Mg(Al)O and PtGa/Mg(Al)O."

The literature primarily discusses platinum-based catalysts for light olefin dehydrogenation, particularly those supported on calcined hydrotalcites (Mg(Al)O). It does not provide a direct comparison with metal oxide-based catalysts like CrOx, gallium, indium, vanadium, zinc, and molybdenum oxides.

For platinum-based catalysts:

Composition: The catalysts discussed are primarily Pt supported on Mg(Al)O, with promoters like Sn, Ga, and Ge.

Effectiveness: These catalysts show high alkene selectivity, minimal coke formation, and good activity for dehydrogenation of light alkanes (ethane and propane) to alkenes.

Recent developments: The study introduces a novel Pt/Mg(Ga)(Al)O catalyst, which shows improved performance over conventional bimetallic catalysts like PtSn/Mg(Al)O and PtGa/Mg(Al)O.

Potential advantages: The Pt/Mg(Ga)(Al)O catalyst exhibits lower deactivation and coke formation compared to conventional bimetallic catalysts, while maintaining high selectivity for ethene and propene production.

The document does not provide information on industrial applications of these catalysts or comparisons with metal oxide-based catalysts. To fully answer the question, additional information from other sources would be needed, especially regarding metal oxide-based catalysts and their industrial applications.

该文献主要讨论了用于轻质烯烃脱氢的铂基催化剂，特别是那些负载在煅烧水滑石（Mg(Al)O）上的催化剂。它没有直接与金属氧化物基催化剂（如CrOx、镓、铟、钒、锌和钼氧化物）进行比较。

对于铂基催化剂：

组成：讨论的催化剂主要是负载在Mg(Al)O上的Pt，添加了Sn、Ga和Ge等助剂。

有效性：这些催化剂在轻质烷烃（乙烷和丙烷）脱氢生成烯烃的过程中表现出高烯烃选择性、最小的积碳形成和良好的活性。

最新发展：该研究引入了一种新型的Pt/Mg(Ga)(Al)O催化剂，其性能优于传统的双金属催化剂，如PtSn/Mg(Al)O和PtGa/Mg(Al)O。

潜在优势：Pt/Mg(Ga)(Al)O催化剂与传统的双金属催化剂相比，表现出较低的失活和积碳形成，同时保持了乙烯和丙烯生产的高选择性。

该文档没有提供这些催化剂的工业应用信息，也没有与金属氧化物基催化剂进行比较。要完整回答这个问题，需要从其他来源获取额外信息，特别是关于金属氧化物基催化剂及其工业应用的信息。
