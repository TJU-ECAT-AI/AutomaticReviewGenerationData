The literature primarily focuses on noble metal-based catalysts, particularly platinum, for the nonoxidative dehydrogenation of light olefins. It does not provide a direct comparison with metal oxide-based catalysts.

Composition: The main catalysts discussed are Pt-based, supported on calcined hydrotalcites (Mg(Al)O). These catalysts are often promoted with elements like Sn, Ga, and Ge.

Effectiveness: Pt/Mg(Ga)(Al)O catalysts are described as highly selective for the formation of ethene and propene from ethane and propane. They exhibit high alkene selectivity, minimal coke formation, and better catalyst activity compared to unpromoted catalysts.

Industrial applications: The catalysts are used for the dehydrogenation of light alkanes (ethane and propane) to produce alkenes (ethene and propene) and hydrogen.

Recent developments: The study presents Pt/Mg(Ga)(Al)O as a novel catalyst that shows improved performance over conventional bimetallic catalysts like PtSn/Mg(Al)O and PtGa/Mg(Al)O, particularly in terms of lower deactivation and coke formation.

Potential advantages: The Pt/Mg(Ga)(Al)O catalysts show high selectivity, improved activity, and better resistance to deactivation and coke formation compared to other Pt-based catalysts.

The document does not provide information on metal oxide-based catalysts such as CrOx, gallium, indium, vanadium, zinc, and molybdenum oxides for comparison.

该文献主要关注贵金属基催化剂，特别是铂，用于轻质烯烃的非氧化脱氢。它没有直接与金属氧化物基催化剂进行比较。

组成：讨论的主要催化剂是基于铂的，以煅烧的水滑石（Mg(Al)O）为载体。这些催化剂通常用Sn、Ga和Ge等元素进行改性。

有效性：Pt/Mg(Ga)(Al)O催化剂被描述为对乙烷和丙烷生成乙烯和丙烯具有高度选择性。与未改性的催化剂相比，它们表现出较高的烯烃选择性、最小的积碳形成和更好的催化活性。

工业应用：这些催化剂用于轻质烷烃（乙烷和丙烷）的脱氢，生产烯烃（乙烯和丙烯）和氢气。

最新发展：研究提出Pt/Mg(Ga)(Al)O作为一种新型催化剂，相比传统的双金属催化剂如PtSn/Mg(Al)O和PtGa/Mg(Al)O，表现出更好的性能，特别是在降低失活和积碳形成方面。

潜在优势：与其他基于铂的催化剂相比，Pt/Mg(Ga)(Al)O催化剂表现出高选择性、改进的活性以及更好的抗失活和积碳形成能力。

该文档没有提供关于金属氧化物基催化剂（如CrOx、镓、铟、钒、锌和钼氧化物）的信息以供比较。
