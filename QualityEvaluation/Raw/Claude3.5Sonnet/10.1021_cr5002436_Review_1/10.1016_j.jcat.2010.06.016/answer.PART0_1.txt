The literature primarily focuses on noble metal-based catalysts, particularly platinum, for the nonoxidative dehydrogenation of light olefins. It does not provide a direct comparison with metal oxide-based catalysts.

For platinum-based catalysts:

Composition: The catalysts discussed are primarily Pt supported on calcined hydrotalcites (Mg(Al)O), with promoters such as Ga, Sn, or Ge.

Effectiveness: These catalysts show high alkene selectivity, minimal coke formation, and good catalyst activity. Pt/Mg(Ga)(Al)O catalysts exhibit lower deactivation and coke formation compared to conventional bimetallic catalysts like PtSn/Mg(Al)O and PtGa/Mg(Al)O.

Recent developments: The formation of PtGa alloys in Ga-modified Pt catalysts has been shown to enhance activity, selectivity, and resistance to coke formation.

The literature does not provide information on industrial applications or potential advantages of these catalysts compared to metal oxide-based catalysts. It also does not discuss metal oxide-based catalysts such as CrOx, gallium, indium, vanadium, zinc, and molybdenum oxides for this application.

该文献主要关注贵金属基催化剂，特别是铂，用于轻烯烃的非氧化脱氢。它没有直接与金属氧化物基催化剂进行比较。

对于铂基催化剂：

组成：讨论的催化剂主要是负载在煅烧水滑石（Mg(Al)O）上的Pt，添加Ga、Sn或Ge等助剂。

有效性：这些催化剂表现出高烯烃选择性、最小的焦炭形成和良好的催化活性。与传统的双金属催化剂（如PtSn/Mg(Al)O和PtGa/Mg(Al)O）相比，Pt/Mg(Ga)(Al)O催化剂表现出更低的失活和焦炭形成。

最新发展：在Ga改性的Pt催化剂中形成PtGa合金被证明可以提高活性、选择性和抗焦炭形成能力。

该文献没有提供这些催化剂在工业应用方面的信息，也没有讨论它们相对于金属氧化物基催化剂的潜在优势。同时，文献也没有讨论CrOx、镓、铟、钒、锌和钼氧化物等金属氧化物基催化剂在这一应用中的情况。
