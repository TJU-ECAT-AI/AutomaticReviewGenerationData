[1] "Recent studies have shown that calcined hydrotalcites, referred to as Mg(Al)O, are good supports for Pt-based catalysts for the dehydrogenation of light alkanes to alkenes and hydrogen [19]."

[2] "High alkene selectivity, minimal coke formation, and better catalyst activity can be achieved by promoting Pt supported on Mg(Al)O or other supports with elements such as Sn, Ga, and Ge [9,1416,18]."

[3] "Catalyst performance is strongly dependent on Ga content in the support, a peak in activity for both ethane and propane dehydrogenation occurs at Ga/Pt = 1.45.4, and selectivity is a monotonic function of Ga/Pt, reaching nearly 100% at Ga/Pt = 5.4."

[4] "We have shown that Pt/Mg(Ga)(Al)O catalysts prepared by the method described in Part I of this work leads to an active alkane dehydrogenation catalyst that is highly selective for the formation of ethene and propene from ethane and propane, respectively."

[5] "We have also shown that Pt/Mg(Ga)(Al)O catalysts exhibit lower deactivation and coke formation than conventional bimetallic catalysts, such as PtSn/Mg(Al)O and PtGa/Mg(Al)O."

The literature primarily focuses on platinum-based catalysts for light olefin dehydrogenation, particularly Pt supported on calcined hydrotalcites (Mg(Al)O). It does not provide a comprehensive comparison with metal oxide-based catalysts like CrOx, gallium, indium, vanadium, zinc, and molybdenum oxides.

For Pt-based catalysts:

Composition: Pt supported on Mg(Al)O, promoted with elements like Sn, Ga, and Ge.

Effectiveness: High alkene selectivity and activity, with minimal coke formation. Pt/Mg(Ga)(Al)O catalysts show peak activity at Ga/Pt ratios of 1.4-5.4, with selectivity reaching nearly 100% at Ga/Pt = 5.4.

Recent developments: Pt/Mg(Ga)(Al)O catalysts have been developed, showing high selectivity for ethene and propene formation from ethane and propane, respectively.

Advantages: Pt/Mg(Ga)(Al)O catalysts exhibit lower deactivation and coke formation compared to conventional bimetallic catalysts like PtSn/Mg(Al)O and PtGa/Mg(Al)O.

The document does not provide information on industrial applications or a comparison with metal oxide-based catalysts. To fully answer the question, additional information from other sources would be needed to discuss metal oxide-based catalysts and make a comprehensive comparison.

该文献主要集中在轻烯烃脱氢用铂基催化剂上，特别是以煅烧水滑石(Mg(Al)O)为载体的Pt催化剂。它没有提供与金属氧化物基催化剂(如CrOx、镓、铟、钒、锌和钼氧化物)的全面比较。

对于铂基催化剂：

组成：以Mg(Al)O为载体的Pt，并用Sn、Ga和Ge等元素进行改性。

有效性：具有高烯烃选择性和活性，且积碳量少。Pt/Mg(Ga)(Al)O催化剂在Ga/Pt比为1.4-5.4时活性达到峰值，在Ga/Pt = 5.4时选择性接近100%。

最新发展：开发了Pt/Mg(Ga)(Al)O催化剂，对乙烷和丙烷分别生成乙烯和丙烯表现出高选择性。

优势：与传统的双金属催化剂如PtSn/Mg(Al)O和PtGa/Mg(Al)O相比，Pt/Mg(Ga)(Al)O催化剂表现出更低的失活和积碳形成。

该文档没有提供有关工业应用或与金属氧化物基催化剂比较的信息。要全面回答这个问题，需要从其他来源获取额外的信息，以讨论金属氧化物基催化剂并进行全面比较。
