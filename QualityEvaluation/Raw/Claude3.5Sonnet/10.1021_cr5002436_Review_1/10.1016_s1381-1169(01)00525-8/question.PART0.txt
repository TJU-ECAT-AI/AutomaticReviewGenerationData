Abstract
Bimetallic PtSn/MgAl2O4 catalysts with different metal concentrations, used for propane dehydrogenation, were
prepared by the impregnation, coprecipitationimpregnation and solgel methods. Pore size distribution and surface acid-
ity of the catalysts were studied by N2 physisorption and temperature programmed desorption of ammonia (TPD-NH3),
respectively. Reduction behaviors of the catalysts were characterized by temperature programmed reduction (TPR) technique.
In the catalysts containing 0.6 wt.% Sn, some platinum-modified by tin crystals were produced by association with acid sites
of the support, where hydrogen reduction took place above 500 C. These tin-modified platinum species were found to be
favorable for propane dehydrogenation reaction and also to be responsible for the improvement of the activity as tin content
increases from 0.3 to 0.6 wt.%. Metal dispersion, pore size distribution and acidity of the support strongly impact the selectiv-
ity and stability of the catalysts. The solgel catalyst showed better selectivity but lower stability compared to other catalysts
that can be explained by its very narrow pore size distribution and relatively stronger acidity as well as more homogeneous
metal distribution on the support. When the catalysts were pretreated with oxygen and then hydrogen, their catalytic activities
were significantly enhanced largely due to a better metal distribution on the support.  2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights

1. Introduction
Catalytic dehydrogenation of light alkanes has
great industrial importance because it represents an
alternative for obtaining alkenes for polymerization
and other organic synthesis from low cost saturated
hydrocarbon feed stocks. Propane dehydrogenation is
such an interesting research topic due to the potential
use of the propane as a source of propene, which

is an important starting material in the petrochemi-
cal industries. Some processes such as OLEFLEX,
Phillips STAR, CATOFIN, Linde BASF, etc. have
been developed and well documented [13].
Bimetallic tin-modified platinum supported on dif-
ferent supports like Al2O3, ZrO2, SiO2, which are be-
lieved to be the promising catalysts used in the propane
dehydrogenation process have been extensively inves-
tigated [47]. Tin is believed to inhibit hydrocracking,
isomerization and coke formation [810]; addition of
tin improves platinum dispersion due to favorable size
ensemble formation based on geometric effects [11].
Also it was suggested that PtSn alloy is formed at the

ratio of Pt to Sn 1:1, that increases hydrogen mobility
on the catalysts [4,1214].
Most of the propane dehydrogenation catalysts are
PtSn supported on alumina. Owing to the very strong
interaction between the metals and alumina support,
that affects the reduction behaviors and stability of
the catalysts; a few work have been focused on the
use of some solid spinels such as magnesium alumi-
nate or zinc aluminate, instead of alumina, as new
support [1517]. Under operation promoted platinum
catalysts supported on magnesium-aluminate spinel
have a good activity and stability. So far studies about
dehydrogenation, in particular, propane dehydrogena-
tion over PtSn/MgAl2O4 catalysts, showed that a
significant activity increase was obtained upon the
introduction of various amounts of tin through several
preparation methods [18,19].
It is the purpose of the present work to study the
catalytic performance of bimetallic PtSn/MgAl2O4
catalysts prepared by using different methods in the
propane dehydrogenation reaction. For this kind of
support, several questions arise: for instance, effects
of the structures of the supports on the catalytic prop-
erties and the action of tin addition including the re-
duction behavior as well as interaction between the
metal and support and different crystal phases located
on the support need to be further clarified.
2. Experimental
2.1. Supports preparation
MgAl2O4 was prepared by coprecipitation of par-
ents salts (Mg(NO3)2·6H2O, Al(NO3)3·9H2O) with
(NH4)2CO3 as precipitating agent at a pH value
of 10. The fresh sample was dried at 120 C and
calcined at 600 C in air for 8 h. X-ray diffraction
analysis showed that the calcined sample has spinel
structure.
2.2. Catalysts preparation
2.2.1. Impregnation
The monometallic catalysts were prepared at
80 C by impregnating a solution of SnCl2·4H2O or
H2PtCl6·H2O with ethanol as solvent on the calcined
magnesium-aluminate spinel support in a rotatory
vacuum evaporator. The dried samples were calcined
at 600 C in a flow of air for 8 h.
The bimetallic PtSn catalysts were prepared by a
double impregnation of the support: firstly with an
alcoholic solution of SnCl2·4H2O, dried at 120 C and
followed by an alcoholic solution of H2PtCl6·H2O,
finally dried at 120 C for 4 h and calcined at 600 C
for 8 h in an air flow. The nominal compositions were
for platinum 0.5 wt.% and for two tin compositions
0.3 and 0.6 wt.%.
2.2.2. Coprecipitationimpregnation
By using (NH4)2CO3 as precipitating agent and
Mg(NO3)2·6H2O, Al(NO3)3·9H2O, SnCl2·4H2O as
precursors, three solutions were, respectively, pre-
pared by dissolving the above three precursors in
deionized water. The amount of SnCl2·4H2O was con-
trolled to acquire 0.3 and 0.6 wt.% of metal tin. The
above solutions, drop by drop, were simultaneously
added into a container with a continuous stirring. The
pH value of the mixture was fixed at about 10. After
the addition, the mixture was aged for 10 h followed
by washing, drying and finally calcined at 600 C in
a flow of air for 8 h. Afterwards, the calcined sam-
ple was impregnated with H2PtCl6·H2O to obtain
PtSn/MgAl2O4 catalysts with 0.5 wt.% of metal
platinum.
2.2.3. Solgel method
As an example, 0.5 wt.% Pt/MgAl2O4 solgel
catalyst was synthesized by using metallic-organic
compounds as precursors and alcohols as solvent.
Magnesium ethoxide (Mg(OC2H5)2) and aluminum
sec-butoxide (Al(OC4H11)3) were added into a con-
tainer with 100 ml ethanol, the solution was stirred for
2 h. And then, H2PtCl6·H2O was slowly dropped into
the above solution to form a sol. Water was slowly
added into the sol in a mole ratio of alcohols/H2O of
10. The mixture was stirred and a gel was formed,
afterwards the solvent was eliminated in a rotatory
vacuum evaporator for 12 h. Finally, the sample was
dried at 120 C for 4 h and calcined at 600 C in
flowing of air for 8 h.
2.3. Pretreatment
Before the catalytic test, the catalysts were pre-
treated with different methods:
J. Salmones et al. / Journal of Molecular Catalysis A: Chemical 184 (2002) 203213
205
He treatment. The samples were heated in the reac-
tor at 550 C for 2 h with a increasing temperature rate
by 5 C/min in a He flow for eliminating the adsorbed
impurities.
H2 reduction in situ. After the He treatment, the
samples were treated with a stream of 99.99% H2 in
the reactor at 550 C for 2 h in order to reduce metal
oxide to metal particles.
Oxidationreduction in situ. After treatment with
He, the catalysts were first pretreated in the reactor in
an air flow of 40 ml/min at 550 C for 1 h and then
flowing He was introduced into the reactor to purge
out the oxygen from the reaction system. Finally a
stream of 99.99% H2 was introduced to the reac-
tor to reduce the catalyst at the same temperature
for 2 h.
2.4. Temperature programmed reduction (TPR)
The catalysts were first pretreated in a flow of He
(30 ml/min) at 550 C for 1 h, and then they were
cooled to room temperature in He atmosphere. After
the thermal treatment, the catalysts were reduced in
a mixture of 10% H2 in He at increasing temperature
programmed to a rate of 10 C/min up to 700 C. Cat-
alyst weight used for TPR measurements was about
0.1 g. The TPR experiments were carried out on a
Zeton Altamire Model AMI-3 equipment.
2.5. Temperature programmed desorption of
ammonia (TPD-NH3)
To measure acidity of the catalysts, TPD-NH3
experiments were carried out in a Zeton Altamire
Model AMI-3 equipment. The samples were first
treated in a He flow (30 ml/min) at 550 C for 2 h,
and then cooled to 100 C. Ammonia (20 vol.%) was
introduced in an He flow into the reactor for 30 min.
Finally the samples were heated with increasing
the temperature rate by 10 C/min in a He flow to
700 C.
2.6. Surface area and pore size distribution
The specific surface area and pore size distribu-
tion of the samples were measured in a Digisorb 2600
equipment by analyzing N2 physisorption isotherms.
2.7. Catalytic test
Catalytic performance in propane dehydrogenation
was tested at 550 C and 590 Torr. In all the cases, 0.1 g
of catalyst (80120 mesh) and a total flow rate (v0)
of 4.8 l/h were used. An equimolar blend of propane
and hydrogen was fed to the reactor. The total reaction
time is 180 min. Before each reaction test, catalysts
were pretreated under different conditions as described
above.
The conversion of propane (XA) is defined as the
percentage of propane converted to all different prod-
ucts. The selectivity to propene (S) is defined as the
amount of propene divided by the amount of reac-
tant converted to all products. The main by-products
observed were methane, ethane and ethylene. To
describe deactivation curves, an overall first-order par-
allel deactivation mechanism was assumed. In most
cases, the propane reaction was carried out at a low
conversion. Based on the first-order for deactivation
and the surface reaction kinetics, the following model
can be derived from which the deactivation constants
(kd) were obtained [20]:
ln
1 XA
XA
= kdt + ln
1 XA0

where XA0 is the initial conversion of propane. The
stability of the catalyst (E) was defined as
E = conversion after 180 min of reaction

3. Results
3.1. Textural properties
The specific surface area and textural properties of
the various catalysts were measured by low tempera-
ture physisorption of N2 (Table 1). The specific surface
area (A) increases and the mean pore diameter (D) of
the catalysts decreases in following orders (1) and (2):
Aimpregnation < Acopimpregnation < Asolgel

50 Å (Fig. 3a and b), which is only one-tenth of the
pore size of the catalysts prepared by using impreg-
nation method (Fig. 1a and b). These results clearly

show that the preparation methods strongly affect the
textural properties of the samples that must produce
important effect on catalytic activity which will be
discussed in the following section.

3.2. Catalysts activation
It is observed in Fig. 4a that the catalysts pre-
treated with He showed the lower activity (<6%
conversion). When the catalysts were reduced by
hydrogen, the conversion of propane increased by
40% in comparison with the simple He pretreatment
(Fig. 4b). When the catalyst was first oxidized with
oxygen and then reduced by hydrogen (Fig. 4c),
the propane conversions and stability were signifi-
cantly increased. The stability (E) of the catalysts
after different treatments increases in the following
order:
Eoxidationreduction > EH2 reduction > EHe pretreatment (3)

Pt0.3% Sn/MgAl2O4 catalyst: (a) He pretreatment; (b) H2 reduc-
tion in situ; (c) oxidation and reduction in situ.
Enhancement of the catalytic activity after oxygen
pretreatment is probably due to the formation of
homogeneity of platinum and tin oxide phases that
are completely reduced in the following H2 reduc-
tion step compared with the catalysts with only H2
pretreatment. In the latter case, the catalysts might
contain other metal species like mixed oxicom-
pounds related to the precursors used, their reduc-
tion mechanism could differ from that of pure oxide
phases.
3.3. Effects of tin content
The activity of the catalysts was strongly affected
by tin addition. Increasing tin content from 0.3 to
0.6 wt.%, results in about 30% increment in propane
conversion for the catalyst prepared by the impregna-
tion technique (Fig. 5a). Tin content, however, almost
does not affect catalysts activity when coprecipitation
impregnation method was used (Fig. 5b). These results
indicate that tin addition is favorable to enhance the
catalytic activity but depends on catalyst preparation
technique.
Tin content also affects catalyst stability. Table 2
reports the data concerning catalysts deactivation con-
stants and catalytic stability. Increasing tin content
from 0.3 to 0.6 wt.%, leads to a decrease in stability
from 0.95 to 0.84 for the impregnated catalysts. How-
ever, for the coprecipitationimpregnation sample, the
stability increases from 0.90 to 0.95.

3.4. Effect of catalysts preparation technique

ods. Under the same reaction conditions, the catalysts
prepared by coprecipitationimpregnation method
(Fig. 6b) shows higher activity than the catalysts
prepared with impregnation (Fig. 6a) and solgel
(Fig. 6c) methods. Worthy of mention is that propane
conversion rapidly decreased in the first 30 min of
the reaction, indicating that this catalyst was eas-
ily deactivated on the fresh surface. After 30 min
of reaction, the catalytic activities of impregnation
and
coprecipitationimpregnation
samples
almost
remained unchanged in the following 150 min. How-
ever, the activity of the solgel sample decreased
continuously. These results show that the different
catalysts have different deactivation behavior. The
deactivation constants of the different catalysts are
shown in Table 2. The catalyst prepared by the solgel
technique showed the bigger deactivation constant,
leading to catalytic unstability. For the catalysts with
0.6% tin, the deactivation rate (kd) decreases in the
following order:
kd copimpregnation < kd impregnation < kd solgel
(4)
The catalyst preparation techniques also have impact
on selectivity of the reaction. All catalysts show a
relatively stable selectivity to propene higher than
90% (Fig. 7). The solgel sample 0.5% Pt0.3%
Sn/MgAl2O4 exhibits the highest selectivity, 97%
(Fig. 7e). The selectivity to propene (S) over the
different catalyst are shown in sequences (5) and (6).

The observed difference in selectivity could be
explained by the different Pt/Sn ratios due to the
nature of the different preparation methods used. It
is well known that it is not easy to achieve uniform
Sn distribution across the support crystals by us-
ing impregnation preparation technique. Therefore,
a part of the impregnated Pt remain separated from
tin atoms, catalyzing cracking and other side reac-
tions, which results in a lower propene selectivity.

may have more uniform tin distribution involving

less side reactions.
3.5. Reduction behaviors of the catalysts
Fig. 8 shows the TPR spectra of the monometal-
lic 0.5% Pt/MgAl2O4 catalysts prepared by impregna-
tion and solgel methods. Two peaks were observed
in TPR profiles for both samples: the first one rang-
ing from 30 to 150 C was centered at about 80 C,
it was assigned to the reduction from Pt(IV) to Pt(II).
The second one centered at 330 C corresponds to the
reduction of Pt(II) ions to Pt0 atoms. However, it is
noted that the second peak area is much bigger than the
first one, indicating that in the second reduction stage
more hydrogen was consumed. This is mostly due to
the reduction occurring in the first stage is not com-
plete. Therefore, it is suggested herein that in the first
reduction stage, the PtO2 crystals were only reduced

to PtOx (1 < x < 2). These reduction steps can be
illustrated in Eqs. (7) and (8):
PtO2 + (2 x)H2 PtOx + (2 x)H2O
(30150C)
(7)
PtOx + xH2 Pt0 + xH2O
(300400C)
(8)
Since some Pt atoms may be possibly buried in the
bulk during the solgel procedure, the number of ex-
posed Pt crystals is therefore less than that of the im-
pregnation sample, resulting in smaller TPR area of the
solgel sample in comparison with the impregnation
one.
Fig. 9 shows the TPR spectra of two monometallic
catalysts 0.3% Sn/MgAl2O4 and 0.6% Sn/MgAl2O4
prepared with coprecipitation method. There are also
two peaks appearing in Fig. 9. The first one with
smaller area ranging from 30 to 150 C and the second
with higher area is in between 150 and 550 C. These
two hydrogen consumption peaks, which are very sim-
ilar to that observed in Fig. 8, were also caused by the
reductions of SnO2 to SnOx (1 < x < 2) and SnOx
to Sn0. The only difference between the two profiles
shown in Fig. 9 is the peak maxima of the second H2
consumption peak slightly shifts 40 C towards higher
temperature when tin content increases from 0.3 to
0.6 wt.%.
The above results indicate that the reduction behav-
iors of monometallic platinum and tin-supported on
magnesium-aluminate spinel are very similar. Their
hydrogen consumption peaks are almost overlapped.

and 0.5% Pt0.6% Sn/MgAl2O4 prepared by impregnation.
This produces difficulty in distinguishing the reduc-
tion properties of PtSn bimetallic catalysts.
The TPR spectra of bimetallic PtSn catalysts
0.5% Pt0.3% Sn/MgAl2O4
and 0.5% Pt0.6%
Sn/MgAl2O4, prepared by impregnation method are
shown in Fig. 10. For the sample with 0.3 wt.% tin,
two peaks were observed: one centered at about
100 C and the other at 330 C, similar to the re-
ductions of single metal-supported catalysts shown
in Figs. 8 and 9. Because the similar reduction tem-
perature regions of monometallic platinum and tin
catalysts, we according to the above analysis assigned
these two hydrogen consumption peaks in Fig. 10 to
the coreduction of SnO2 (PtO2) to SnOx (PtOx) and
of SnOx (PtOx) to Sn0 (Pt0).
When tin content increases to 0.6 wt.%, the TPR
spectrum consists of three peaks (Fig. 10); the first
two are similar to those shown in Fig. 9, they appear
between 30 and 150 C as well as between 150 and
400 C, originated from the reductions of platinum
and tin oxides to metal platinum and tin crystals. The
third one corresponded to a reduction temperature
between 400 and 620 C and centered at 500 C. Since
this high temperature peak is related to tin content, it
may be produced by the reduction of a platinum-tin
oxide species, which will be further discussed in the
following section.
The TPR spectra of the bimetallic catalysts prepared
by solgel are shown in Fig. 11. An additional hydro-
gen consumption peak appearing at higher tempera-
ture range in the catalyst with 0.6 wt.% Sn was also
clearly observed.

pared by coprecipitationimpregnation technique. If

one compares Figs. 10 and 11, some differences can
be found with respect to Fig. 12: first, the low tempera-
ture peak shifts to about 200 C; second, both catalysts
have a third reduction peak with larger area. These
differences can be explained by the different prepara-
tion techniques. These two catalysts were prepared by
first introducing tin into the support by using copre-
cipitation method and then impregnating platinum on
the support containing tin. Tin might strongly interact
with the support by anchoring in the structure of the
support. When platinum was supported on this kind of
coprecipitationimpregnated support the interactions
between platinum and tin oxides as well as metals and
support are stronger than those shown by the catalysts
prepared by impregnation and solgel. This alters their
reduction properties, thus leading to a shift of reduc-
tion temperature of SnO2 (PtO2) to SnOx (PtOx) to
higher values.

4. Discussion
Several groups [6,18] report that in bimetallic
PtSn supported on Al2O3 catalysts, only one TPR
peak was observed because most of tin exist in a form
of SnOx (0 < x < 2) and only a small part of tin is
in zerovalent state forming alloys with platinum. This
is due to the very strong interaction of tin and the
support, which results in tin oxide stabilized on alu-
mina. However, existence of tin oxide was not found
in our catalysts since two or three reduction stages
were observed after the H2 reduction. This is also an
indication of a weak interaction between metal oxides
and magnesium-aluminate spinel, particularly in the
cases of low tin content on the catalysts prepared with
impregnation or solgel techniques.
The PtSn alloy phases can be formed in PtSn
catalyst containing a 1:1 Pt/Sn ratio [4]. These PtSn
alloy particles are homogeneously distributed on the
surface of the support. At lower Pt/Sn ratio, Pt3Sn or
PtSn metal species can also be formed [1214]. There-
fore, in the 0.5% Pt0.3% Sn/MgAl2O4 catalysts, the
observation of two peaks in the TPR spectra indicates
that they are not only probably caused by the reduc-
tion of platinum or tin oxide to form metal particles
but to form PtSn alloyed phases also.
An important information revealed from the TPR
measurements is found in the solgel and impregna-
tion samples, only two peaks were formed in the TPR
spectra in the sample containing 0.3% tin but three
peaks in the samples with 0.6 wt.% of tin (Figs. 10
and 11). This may be responsible for the difference
of propane dehydrogenation between catalysts with
different tin content. As mentioned above, in the cat-
alysts prepared by using solgel and impregnation
methods, the activity was improved as tin content in-
creased from 0.3 to 0.6 wt.%. The appearance of the
third peak in the TPR spectra of the catalysts contain-
ing 0.6 wt.% Sn strongly indicates that some stable tin
crystal structure that is reduced at high temperature
could be responsible for the activity enhancement.
The above suggestion regarding the effect of tin on
activity is also supported by the results obtained from
the catalysts prepared by coprecipitationimpregnation
method. As shown in Fig. 5b, the conversions of
propane on the 0.5% Pt0.3% Sn/MgAl2O4 and
0.5% Pt0.6% Sn/MgAl2O4 catalysts prepared by
coprecipitationimpregnation, are very similar and
212

they are much higher than that performed on the
0.5% Pt0.3% Sn/MgAl2O4 catalyst synthesized by
solgel and impregnation techniques (Figs. 5 and 6).
This can be explained by their TPR behaviors. In
the coprecipitationimpregnation samples, the TPR
spectra show three peaks (Fig. 12). The first one is
in the temperature region lower than 250 C, the sec-
ond is in between 250 and 400 C and the third is in
between 400 and 700 C. In these three peaks, the
relative area of the third is the largest, which reveals
that the metal crystals reduced at higher temperature
are the main component for these two samples. In
comparison with the TPR spectra of the impregna-
tion and solgel samples (Figs. 10 and 11), the third
peak in both coprecipitationimpregnation samples
are much bigger. Therefore, the activities of these
coprecipitationimpregnation samples are higher and
due to the similar area of the third H2 consumption
peak, their catalytic activity is also very similar on the
catalysts prepared by coprecipitationimpregnation.
One question arises: what structure corresponds
to the metallic crystals produced by reduction tem-
perature above 500 C? One is confirmed that these
crystals must relate to high tin content. However, it is
difficult to understand why in the mono-tin-supported
catalysts with 0.6% tin, the TPR peak at above 500 C
was not observed (Fig. 9). This also indicates that
the metal crystals reduced at high temperature are
not only related to tin content but to platinum also. It
may correspond to a metallic Sn modified by metallic
platinum, similar to the suggestion made by Arteaga
et al. [19], that in the tin-rich PtSn/Al2O3 catalyst,
after being reduced, some Pt atoms were covered
with Sn atoms. This result is also similar to the work
reported by Humblot et al. [21], who postulate that
there exist many platinum crystals surrounded by tin
atoms on the Pt surface, forming so-called sites iso-
lation platinum crystals in the bimetallic PtSn/SiO2
catalyst, that are responsible for the extremely se-
lective dehydrogenation process of isobutane to
isobutene.
TPD-NH3 measurements show that in the tin-rich
samples, the acidity of the catalysts decreased
(Table 1) when tin content increases from 0.3 to
0.6%, the amount of adsorbed ammonia, respec-
tively, decreases for the impregnation sample from
1041.8 to 905.5 mol NH3/g, for the coprecipitation
impregnation sample from 1179.6 to 863.1 mol
NH3/g and for the solgel sample from 1355.7 to
816.1 mol NH3/g.
It seems from the acidity data that increasing
tin concentration poisons acid sites (Table 1). It is
well-known that many acidic sites exist on the sup-
port, since the relatively low metal concentration
applied in our catalysts, most surface of the support
is not occupied by the metals. Therefore, some of
tin species in the tin-rich case, might be directly
located on the acid sites in the support, diminish-
ing their number. This is also in agreement with the
other claims that deactivation of acidic sites on the
alumina support is caused by the spreading of tin
species over the alumina surface [2225]. From this,
we assumed that the crystals which could be reduced
by hydrogen at higher temperature were produced by
platinum-modified tin species in association with the
acidic sites in the support.
The reduction of a number of acid sites can sup-
press acid catalytic cracking reactions, which implies
an improvement of selectivity to dehydrogenation
products. Since tin addition reduces the number of the
acid centers, the selectivity to propene can hence be
enhanced as shown in Fig. 7. However, the factors in-
fluencing the selectivity of propane dehydrogenation
are very complex. It is a function of preparation meth-
ods, acidity and metal loading, and it is also sensitive
to catalysts textural structure. As shown in Fig. 1, the
catalysts prepared by the impregnation show a much
wide pore size distribution ranging from 10 to 1000 Å
and for coprecipitationimpregnation catalysts, it was
doubly distributed in relatively wide range between 10
and 700 Å (Fig. 2). However, for the solgel sample
with 0.3% Sn, the pore size was uniformly distributed
in a very narrow range between 10 and 40 Å and it was
centered at about 30 Å (Fig. 3a). In another solgel
sample with 0.6% Sn, also single pore size distribution
was observed in a very narrow range between 10 and
80 Å. Generally, the narrow pore size distribution has
the function for shape-selection of the reactant and
products. In other words, it favors the dehydrogena-
tion but not the cracking reactions. Thus the propene
selectivity is higher on the solgel catalysts. It is con-
cluded from this result that propane dehydrogenation
to propene is a catalyst textural-sensitive reaction.
On the other hand, solgel catalysts present a
stronger acidity than the others, due to the acidic
catalyzing action, more coke is formed on both the

213
metallic crystals and support. In the very narrow pore
channels in solgel catalysts, coke is easily accumu-
lated in the channel and is difficult to move out of the
sample. The coke might cover the active sites or block
the pore mouth, resulting in a rapid deactivation. This
is reasonable to explain why the catalytic activity of
the solgel catalysts is unstable.
It is also noteworthy that in the initial stage of the
reaction, all the catalysts show a decrease in activity
but an increase in selectivity to propene as the reac-
tion time increases to 30 min. This is most likely due
to the rapid coking occurring in the metallic sites that
are active for cracking reaction in the beginning of the
reaction. The produced coke or carbon deposit may
preferentially covers these sites and poison the crack-
ing activity, leading to reduction of the total conver-
sion, as a result, it relatively enhances the selectivity
to propene.
5. Conclusions
The H2 reduction behaviors of bimetallic Pt
Sn/MgAl2O4 catalysts are related to tin content and
preparation techniques, in the samples with 0.3 wt.%
Sn, when the solgel and impregnation techniques
were applied, there are two hydrogen consumption
peaks, respectively, centered at about 100 and 330 C,
corresponding to the reduction steps of PtO2 and SnO2
to PtOx and SnOx (1 < x < 2) and then to Pt0 and
Sn0. In the samples with 0.6 wt.% Sn, besides the plat-
inum and tin phases present, a new kind of tin species
were produced, which strongly interacted with the
support in the presence of platinum, it could only be
reduced up to 500 C. This kind of platinum-modified
tin crystals are responsible for the improvement of
the catalytic activity of tin-rich samples.
Tin content showed very important effects on the
catalyst acidity. Increasing tin content results in a re-
markable reduction of acidity of all the catalysts pre-
pared by different methods, this is a strong indication
that some of tin species in the tin-rich samples poison
the acid sites on the support by tin interaction with
these acid centers.
Metal distribution, pore size distribution and acidity,
shows that they strongly depend on the different prepa-
ration methods, affecting the selectivity and stability of
the catalysts. The solgel catalyst shows very narrow
pore size distribution and a larger number of acid sites
as well as higher metal distribution, which benefit not
only the dehydrogenation reaction but coke forma-
tion also, therefore the solgel catalyst shows higher
selectivity to propene but lower catalytic stability.
