The given literature does not contain information to directly compare and contrast noble metal-based catalysts (particularly Platinum) with metal oxide-based catalysts for the nonoxidative dehydrogenation of light olefins. The document focuses specifically on PtSn catalysts supported on MgAl2O4 for propane dehydrogenation. It does not discuss other metal oxide catalysts like CrOx, gallium, indium, vanadium, zinc, or molybdenum oxides.

The literature provides some insights into platinum-based catalysts:

1. Composition: The study examines bimetallic PtSn catalysts supported on MgAl2O4 spinel, with Pt content of 0.5 wt% and Sn content varying from 0.3 to 0.6 wt%.

2. Effectiveness: PtSn catalysts show good activity for propane dehydrogenation, with propene selectivity over 90%. Increasing Sn content from 0.3 to 0.6 wt% improved catalyst activity in some cases.

3. Preparation methods: The catalysts were prepared by impregnation, coprecipitation-impregnation, and sol-gel methods, which affected their properties and performance.

4. Recent developments: The study investigates the effects of preparation methods, Sn content, and pretreatment on catalyst performance and reduction behavior.

5. Potential advantages: PtSn catalysts showed high selectivity to propene and good stability under certain conditions.

However, the document does not provide information to compare these platinum-based catalysts with metal oxide catalysts or discuss their relative industrial applications.

给定的文献没有直接比较和对比贵金属基催化剂（特别是铂）与金属氧化物基催化剂在轻烯烃非氧化脱氢反应中的性能。该文档专门关注了以MgAl2O4为载体的PtSn催化剂在丙烷脱氢反应中的应用。它没有讨论其他金属氧化物催化剂，如CrOx、镓、铟、钒、锌或钼氧化物。

该文献提供了一些关于铂基催化剂的见解：

1. 组成：研究考察了以MgAl2O4尖晶石为载体的双金属PtSn催化剂，Pt含量为0.5 wt%，Sn含量从0.3到0.6 wt%不等。

2. 有效性：PtSn催化剂在丙烷脱氢反应中表现出良好的活性，丙烯选择性超过90%。在某些情况下，将Sn含量从0.3增加到0.6 wt%可以提高催化剂活性。

3. 制备方法：催化剂通过浸渍法、共沉淀-浸渍法和溶胶-凝胶法制备，这些方法影响了催化剂的性能和表现。

4. 最新发展：该研究探讨了制备方法、Sn含量和预处理对催化剂性能和还原行为的影响。

5. 潜在优势：在某些条件下，PtSn催化剂表现出高丙烯选择性和良好的稳定性。

然而，该文档没有提供将这些铂基催化剂与金属氧化物催化剂进行比较的信息，也没有讨论它们在工业应用中的相对优势。

The given literature does not contain information comparing noble metal-based catalysts and metal oxide-based catalysts for light olefin dehydrogenation. The document focuses specifically on PtSn/MgAl2O4 catalysts for propane dehydrogenation, and does not discuss other metal oxide catalysts like CrOx, gallium, indium, vanadium, zinc or molybdenum oxides. Therefore, I cannot provide a comparison of these different catalyst types or discuss their relative compositions, effectiveness, industrial applications, recent developments, and potential advantages based solely on the information in this document.

The document focuses specifically on PtSn catalysts supported on MgAl2O4 for propane dehydrogenation. It does not discuss other metal oxide catalysts like CrOx, gallium, indium, vanadium, zinc, or molybdenum oxides.

However, we can extend the answer based on the information provided about PtSn catalysts:

1. Composition: The study examines bimetallic PtSn catalysts supported on MgAl2O4 spinel, with Pt content of 0.5 wt% and Sn content varying between 0.3-0.6 wt%.

2. Effectiveness: PtSn catalysts show high activity and selectivity for propane dehydrogenation. The addition of Sn improves catalyst performance.

3. Industrial applications: The paper mentions that propane dehydrogenation is industrially important for producing propene, a key petrochemical feedstock.

4. Recent developments: The study explores different preparation methods (impregnation, coprecipitation-impregnation, sol-gel) and their effects on catalyst properties and performance.

5. Potential advantages: PtSn catalysts offer high selectivity to propene (>90%) and can be tuned by adjusting Sn content and preparation method.

To fully compare these with metal oxide catalysts would require additional information not present in this document.

The given literature does not contain information to directly compare and contrast noble metal-based catalysts like platinum with metal oxide-based catalysts for light olefin dehydrogenation. The document focuses specifically on platinum-tin bimetallic catalysts supported on magnesium aluminate spinel for propane dehydrogenation. It does not discuss other metal oxide catalysts like chromium, gallium, indium, vanadium, zinc or molybdenum oxides.

The literature provides details on the preparation methods, characterization, and catalytic performance of PtSn/MgAl2O4 catalysts, but does not compare these to other catalyst systems. Without additional information on metal oxide catalysts, a comprehensive comparison cannot be made regarding their compositions, effectiveness, industrial applications, recent developments, or potential advantages in light olefin dehydrogenation.

The given literature does not contain information to directly compare and contrast noble metal-based catalysts (particularly Platinum) with metal oxide-based catalysts for light olefin dehydrogenation. The document focuses specifically on PtSn catalysts supported on MgAl2O4 for propane dehydrogenation. It does not discuss other metal oxide catalysts like CrOx, gallium, indium, vanadium, zinc, or molybdenum oxides.

From the information provided, we can only comment on the Pt-based catalyst:

Composition: The catalysts studied are bimetallic PtSn supported on MgAl2O4 spinel. Pt content is 0.5 wt% and Sn content varies between 0.3-0.6 wt%.

Effectiveness: The PtSn catalysts show good activity for propane dehydrogenation, with propene selectivity over 90%. Activity and selectivity are influenced by Sn content, preparation method, and pretreatment.

Industrial applications: While not explicitly stated, the research aims to improve catalysts for industrial propane dehydrogenation to produce propene.

Recent developments: The study explores effects of preparation methods (impregnation, coprecipitation-impregnation, sol-gel) on catalyst properties and performance. It also investigates the role of Sn in modifying Pt and enhancing catalytic activity.

Potential advantages: PtSn catalysts show high selectivity to propene and good stability under certain conditions. The MgAl2O4 support allows for weaker metal-support interactions compared to alumina, potentially benefiting catalyst reducibility and performance.

Without information on other metal oxide catalysts, a comprehensive comparison cannot be made based solely on this document.

根据提供的信息,我们只能评论Pt基催化剂:

成分:研究的催化剂是双金属PtSn负载在MgAl2O4尖晶石上。Pt含量为0.5 wt%,Sn含量在0.3-0.6 wt%之间变化。

有效性:PtSn催化剂在丙烷脱氢反应中表现出良好的活性,丙烯选择性超过90%。活性和选择性受Sn含量、制备方法和预处理的影响。

工业应用:虽然没有明确说明,但该研究旨在改进用于工业丙烷脱氢生产丙烯的催化剂。

最新发展:该研究探讨了制备方法(浸渍、共沉淀-浸渍、溶胶-凝胶)对催化剂性能和表现的影响。它还研究了Sn在修饰Pt和增强催化活性方面的作用。

潜在优势:PtSn催化剂在某些条件下表现出高的丙烯选择性和良好的稳定性。MgAl2O4载体与氧化铝相比允许较弱的金属-载体相互作用,可能有利于催化剂的还原性和性能。

由于缺乏其他金属氧化物催化剂的信息,仅基于这份文档无法进行全面的比较。
