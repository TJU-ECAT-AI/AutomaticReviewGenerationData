[1] "Platinum is known as an active catalyst for the dehydrogenation of light alkanes, but in the absence of modifiers suffers from low alkene selectivity and deactivation due to rapid coke formation."

[2] "Alkene selectivity can be increased, and the tendency to form coke decreased by promoting Pt with elements, such as Sn, Zn, Ge, Pb, and Re"

[3] "A novel approach is described for preparing Ga-promoted Pt particles for the dehydrogenation of light alkanes to alkenes."

[4] "The activity, selectivity and stability of Pt/Mg(Ga)(Al)O catalysts for ethane and propane dehydrogenation are described in the second part of this study"

This literature primarily focuses on platinum-based catalysts for light alkane dehydrogenation, particularly those promoted with gallium. It does not provide a comprehensive comparison with metal oxide-based catalysts like CrOx, indium, vanadium, zinc, and molybdenum oxides.

Regarding platinum-based catalysts:

Composition: The study describes a novel Pt/Mg(Ga)(Al)O catalyst, where platinum is supported on a calcined hydrotalcite-like material containing magnesium, gallium, and aluminum.

Effectiveness: Platinum is described as an active catalyst for light alkane dehydrogenation. However, unmodified platinum suffers from low alkene selectivity and rapid deactivation due to coke formation.

Recent developments: The research presents a new method for preparing gallium-promoted platinum particles. This approach involves using a Mg(Ga)(Al)O support to transfer gallium to the platinum particles during high-temperature reduction.

Potential advantages: Promoting platinum with elements like gallium, tin, zinc, germanium, lead, and rhenium can increase alkene selectivity and decrease coke formation. The specific advantages of the Pt/Mg(Ga)(Al)O catalyst for ethane and propane dehydrogenation are mentioned but not detailed in this excerpt.

The literature does not provide information on industrial applications or comparisons with metal oxide-based catalysts for this reaction.

这篇文献主要集中于用于轻烷烃脱氢的铂基催化剂，特别是那些用镓促进的催化剂。它没有提供与金属氧化物基催化剂（如CrOx、铟、钒、锌和钼氧化物）的全面比较。

关于铂基催化剂：

组成：研究描述了一种新型的Pt/Mg(Ga)(Al)O催化剂，其中铂负载在含有镁、镓和铝的煅烧类水滑石材料上。

有效性：铂被描述为轻烷烃脱氢的活性催化剂。然而，未经修饰的铂存在烯烃选择性低和由于积碳形成而快速失活的问题。

最新发展：该研究提出了一种制备镓促进铂颗粒的新方法。这种方法涉及使用Mg(Ga)(Al)O支持体，在高温还原过程中将镓转移到铂颗粒上。

潜在优势：用镓、锡、锌、锗、铅和铼等元素促进铂可以提高烯烃选择性并减少积碳形成。文中提到了Pt/Mg(Ga)(Al)O催化剂在乙烷和丙烷脱氢方面的具体优势，但在这个摘录中没有详细说明。

这篇文献没有提供关于工业应用或与金属氧化物基催化剂在这一反应中的比较信息。
