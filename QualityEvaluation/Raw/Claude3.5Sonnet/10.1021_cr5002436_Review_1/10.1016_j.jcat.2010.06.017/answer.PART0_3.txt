[1] "Platinum is known as an active catalyst for the dehydrogenation of light alkanes, but in the absence of modifiers suffers from low alkene selectivity and deactivation due to rapid coke formation. Alkene selectivity can be increased, and the tendency to form coke decreased by promoting Pt with elements, such as Sn, Zn, Ge, Pb, and Re [16]."

[2] "A novel approach is described for preparing Ga-promoted Pt particles for the dehydrogenation of light alkanes to alkenes. The modifying element, Ga, was introduced by transference from the support, a calcined Mg(Ga)(Al)O hydrotalcite-like material."

[3] "After reduction at 773873 K, PtGa alloys were observed. It is proposed that at high reduction temperatures, H atoms formed on the surface of the metal particles spill over onto the support where they reduce Ga3+ cation to atomic Ga, which then interacts with the supported Pt to form PtGa alloys."

The literature primarily focuses on platinum-based catalysts for light olefin dehydrogenation, particularly those modified with other elements like gallium. It does not provide a comprehensive comparison with metal oxide-based catalysts.

Platinum catalysts:
- Composition: Platinum, often promoted with elements like Sn, Zn, Ge, Pb, Re, or Ga
- Effectiveness: Active for light alkane dehydrogenation, but suffers from low selectivity and rapid deactivation when unmodified
- Recent developments: Novel approach using Ga-promoted Pt particles supported on Mg(Ga)(Al)O
- Advantages: Improved alkene selectivity and reduced coke formation when modified

The document does not provide information on metal oxide-based catalysts like CrOx, indium, vanadium, zinc, or molybdenum oxides for comparison. It also lacks details on industrial applications for these catalysts.

The formation of PtGa alloys through hydrogen reduction at high temperatures (773-873 K) is described as a recent development, which may offer potential advantages in catalyst performance.

该文献主要关注铂基催化剂在轻质烯烃脱氢中的应用，特别是那些用其他元素如镓改性的催化剂。它没有提供与金属氧化物基催化剂的全面比较。

铂催化剂：
- 成分：铂，通常用Sn、Zn、Ge、Pb、Re或Ga等元素促进
- 有效性：对轻质烷烃脱氢有活性，但未经改性时选择性低且快速失活
- 最新发展：使用负载在Mg(Ga)(Al)O上的镓促进铂粒子的新方法
- 优势：经改性后提高烯烃选择性并减少积碳形成

文档没有提供CrOx、铟、钒、锌或钼氧化物等金属氧化物基催化剂的信息以供比较。它也缺乏这些催化剂在工业应用方面的细节。

文中描述了在高温（773-873 K）下通过氢还原形成PtGa合金的最新发展，这可能在催化剂性能方面提供潜在优势。
