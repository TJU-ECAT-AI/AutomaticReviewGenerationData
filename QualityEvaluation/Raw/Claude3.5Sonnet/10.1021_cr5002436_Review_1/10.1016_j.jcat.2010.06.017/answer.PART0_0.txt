[1] "Platinum is known as an active catalyst for the dehydrogenation of light alkanes, but in the absence of modifiers suffers from low alkene selectivity and deactivation due to rapid coke formation."

[2] "Alkene selectivity can be increased, and the tendency to form coke decreased by promoting Pt with elements, such as Sn, Zn, Ge, Pb, and Re [16]."

[3] "Previous studies have shown that the formation of coke is minimized using non-acidic supports such as KL zeolite, alkali-doped alumina, spinels, and calcined hydrotalcite [Mg(Al)O] [3136]."

Noble metal-based catalysts, particularly platinum, are known to be active for light alkane dehydrogenation. However, unmodified platinum suffers from low alkene selectivity and rapid deactivation due to coke formation. To address these issues, platinum is often promoted with elements like tin, zinc, germanium, lead, and rhenium to increase alkene selectivity and reduce coking.

Metal oxide-based catalysts such as chromium, gallium, indium, vanadium, zinc, and molybdenum oxides are also used for alkane dehydrogenation, though less information is provided about their specific properties in this text.

A novel approach described in the literature involves using gallium-promoted platinum particles supported on a calcined Mg(Ga)(Al)O hydrotalcite-like material. This method introduces gallium by transferring it from the support to the platinum particles.

Both types of catalysts aim to improve selectivity and reduce coke formation. The use of non-acidic supports like KL zeolite, alkali-doped alumina, spinels, and calcined hydrotalcite has been shown to minimize coke formation.

Recent developments in the field include the exploration of bimetallic catalysts, such as PtGa alloys, which can be formed through reduction of the Pt/Mg(Ga)(Al)O catalyst at high temperatures. These developments aim to further enhance catalyst performance and stability.

Industrial applications of these catalysts primarily focus on the production of light olefins, which are important building blocks for chemical and polymer production. The choice between noble metal-based and metal oxide-based catalysts in industry likely depends on factors such as cost, performance, and specific process requirements.

贵金属基催化剂，特别是铂，已知对轻烷烃脱氢具有活性。然而，未经修饰的铂存在烯烃选择性低和由于快速积炭而导致的快速失活问题。为解决这些问题，铂常常被锡、锌、锗、铅和铼等元素促进，以提高烯烃选择性和减少积炭。

金属氧化物基催化剂如铬、镓、铟、钒、锌和钼氧化物也用于烷烃脱氢，尽管本文中对它们的具体性质提供的信息较少。

文献中描述了一种新方法，使用负载在焙烧的Mg(Ga)(Al)O类水滑石材料上的镓促进铂颗粒。这种方法通过将镓从载体转移到铂颗粒上来引入镓。

这两类催化剂都旨在提高选择性和减少积炭形成。使用非酸性载体如KL沸石、碱金属掺杂的氧化铝、尖晶石和焙烧的水滑石已被证明可以最大限度地减少积炭形成。

该领域的最新发展包括探索双金属催化剂，如PtGa合金，这可以通过在高温下还原Pt/Mg(Ga)(Al)O催化剂形成。这些发展旨在进一步提高催化剂的性能和稳定性。

这些催化剂的工业应用主要集中在轻烯烃的生产上，轻烯烃是化学品和聚合物生产的重要原料。工业中选择贵金属基还是金属氧化物基催化剂可能取决于成本、性能和特定工艺要求等因素。
