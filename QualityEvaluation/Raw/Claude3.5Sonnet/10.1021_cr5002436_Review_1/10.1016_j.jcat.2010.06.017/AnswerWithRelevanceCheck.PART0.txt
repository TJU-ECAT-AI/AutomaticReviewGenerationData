          [1] "Platinum is known as an active catalyst for the dehydrogenation of light alkanes, but in the absence of modifiers suffers from low alkene selectivity and deactivation due to rapid coke formation."

[2] "Alkene selectivity can be increased, and the tendency to form coke decreased by promoting Pt with elements, such as Sn, Zn, Ge, Pb, and Re [16]."

[3] "A novel approach is described for preparing Ga-promoted Pt particles for the dehydrogenation of light alkanes to alkenes. The modifying element, Ga, was introduced by transference from the support, a calcined Mg(Ga)(Al)O hydrotalcite-like material."

[4] "Light alkenes, such as ethylene, propylene, and n-butene, are widely used as building blocks for the production of commodity chemical and polymers. Rising demand for light alkenes has exceeded the capacity for the production of these products by petroleum cracking, the current principal source, motivating an interest for seeking other means for producing intermediates."

[5] "After reduction at 773873 K, PtGa alloys were observed. It is proposed that at high reduction temperatures, H atoms formed on the surface of the metal particles spill over onto the support where they reduce Ga3+ cation to atomic Ga, which then interacts with the supported Pt to form PtGa alloys."

[6] "Previous studies have shown that the formation of coke is minimized using non-acidic supports such as KL zeolite, alkali-doped alumina, spinels, and calcined hydrotalcite [Mg(Al)O] [3136]."

          The provided information primarily focuses on noble metal-based catalysts, particularly platinum, for the nonoxidative dehydrogenation of light olefins. The literature does not offer a comprehensive comparison with metal oxide-based catalysts like CrOx, gallium, indium, vanadium, zinc, and molybdenum oxides.

Composition:
- Noble metal-based catalysts: Primarily platinum, often promoted with elements such as Sn, Zn, Ge, Pb, Re, and Ga.
- A novel Ga-promoted Pt catalyst supported on Mg(Ga)(Al)O is described.

Effectiveness:
- Platinum is an active catalyst for light alkane dehydrogenation but suffers from low alkene selectivity and rapid deactivation due to coke formation when unmodified.
- Promoting Pt with other elements increases alkene selectivity and decreases coke formation.

Industrial applications:
- These catalysts are used for the dehydrogenation of light alkanes (e.g., ethane and propane) to produce light alkenes (ethylene, propylene, n-butene).
- Light alkenes are important building blocks for commodity chemicals and polymers.

Recent developments:
- A novel approach for preparing Ga-promoted Pt particles, where Ga is introduced by transference from the support material.
- Formation of PtGa alloys through hydrogen reduction at high temperatures (773-873 K).

Potential advantages:
- Improved alkene selectivity and reduced coke formation when Pt is modified with other elements.
- Use of non-acidic supports (e.g., KL zeolite, alkali-doped alumina, spinels, and calcined hydrotalcite) minimizes coke formation.

The literature does not provide sufficient information to compare these Pt-based catalysts with metal oxide-based catalysts in terms of their effectiveness, industrial applications, or potential advantages for light olefin dehydrogenation.

          提供的信息主要集中在贵金属基催化剂，特别是铂，用于轻质烯烃的非氧化脱氢。文献没有提供与金属氧化物基催化剂（如CrOx、镓、铟、钒、锌和钼氧化物）的全面比较。

组成：
- 贵金属基催化剂：主要是铂，通常用Sn、Zn、Ge、Pb、Re和Ga等元素促进。
- 描述了一种新型的负载在Mg(Ga)(Al)O上的Ga促进Pt催化剂。

有效性：
- 铂是轻烷烃脱氢的活性催化剂，但未经改性时存在烯烃选择性低和由于积碳形成而快速失活的问题。
- 用其他元素促进Pt可以提高烯烃选择性并减少积碳形成。

工业应用：
- 这些催化剂用于轻烷烃（如乙烷和丙烷）的脱氢，生产轻烯烃（乙烯、丙烯、正丁烯）。
- 轻烯烃是商品化学品和聚合物的重要构建块。

最新发展：
- 一种制备Ga促进Pt粒子的新方法，其中Ga通过从载体材料转移引入。
- 通过高温（773-873 K）氢还原形成PtGa合金。

潜在优势：
- 当Pt用其他元素改性时，可以提高烯烃选择性并减少积碳形成。
- 使用非酸性载体（如KL沸石、碱金属掺杂的氧化铝、尖晶石和焙烧的水滑石）可以最小化积碳形成。

文献没有提供足够的信息来比较这些Pt基催化剂与金属氧化物基催化剂在轻烯烃脱氢的有效性、工业应用或潜在优势方面的差异。
