[1] "Platinum is known as an active catalyst for the dehydrogenation of light alkanes, but in the absence of modifiers suffers from low alkene selectivity and deactivation due to rapid coke formation."

[2] "Alkene selectivity can be increased, and the tendency to form coke decreased by promoting Pt with elements, such as Sn, Zn, Ge, Pb, and Re"

[3] "A novel approach is described for preparing Ga-promoted Pt particles for the dehydrogenation of light alkanes to alkenes."

[4] "The activity, selectivity and stability of Pt/Mg(Ga)(Al)O catalysts for ethane and propane dehydrogenation are described in the second part of this study"

The literature primarily focuses on platinum-based catalysts for light alkane dehydrogenation, with some mention of gallium as a promoter. It does not provide a comprehensive comparison between noble metal-based catalysts and metal oxide-based catalysts for light olefin dehydrogenation.

From the information provided:

1. Composition: Platinum is the main active component, often promoted with elements like Sn, Zn, Ge, Pb, Re, and Ga to improve performance.

2. Effectiveness: Platinum is described as an active catalyst for light alkane dehydrogenation. However, unmodified platinum suffers from low alkene selectivity and rapid deactivation due to coke formation.

3. Recent developments: The study presents a novel approach for preparing Ga-promoted Pt particles supported on Mg(Ga)(Al)O for light alkane dehydrogenation.

4. Potential advantages: Promoting Pt with other elements can increase alkene selectivity and decrease coke formation, addressing the main drawbacks of unmodified Pt catalysts.

The document does not provide information on industrial applications or comparisons with metal oxide-based catalysts like CrOx, In, V, Zn, and Mo oxides for light olefin dehydrogenation. To fully answer the question, additional information from other sources would be required.

这篇文献主要关注了以铂为基础的轻烷烃脱氢催化剂，并提到了镓作为促进剂。它没有提供贵金属基催化剂和金属氧化物基催化剂在轻烯烃脱氢方面的全面比较。

根据提供的信息：

1. 组成：铂是主要的活性成分，通常用Sn、Zn、Ge、Pb、Re和Ga等元素进行改性以提高性能。

2. 有效性：铂被描述为轻烷烃脱氢的活性催化剂。然而，未经改性的铂存在烯烃选择性低和由于积碳而快速失活的问题。

3. 最新发展：该研究提出了一种新方法，用于制备负载在Mg(Ga)(Al)O上的Ga促进的Pt颗粒，用于轻烷烃脱氢。

4. 潜在优势：用其他元素促进Pt可以提高烯烃选择性并减少积碳形成，解决了未改性Pt催化剂的主要缺点。

该文档没有提供关于工业应用或与CrOx、In、V、Zn和Mo氧化物等金属氧化物基催化剂在轻烯烃脱氢方面的比较信息。要全面回答这个问题，需要从其他来源获取额外信息。
