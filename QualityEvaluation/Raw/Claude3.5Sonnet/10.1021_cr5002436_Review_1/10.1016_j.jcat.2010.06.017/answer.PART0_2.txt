[1] "Platinum is known as an active catalyst for the dehydrogenation of light alkanes, but in the absence of modifiers suffers from low alkene selectivity and deactivation due to rapid coke formation. Alkene selectivity can be increased, and the tendency to form coke decreased by promoting Pt with elements, such as Sn, Zn, Ge, Pb, and Re [16]."

[2] "Light alkenes, such as ethylene, propylene, and n-butene, are widely used as building blocks for the production of commodity chemical and polymers. Rising demand for light alkenes has exceeded the capacity for the production of these products by petroleum cracking, the current principal source, motivating an interest for seeking other means for producing intermediates."

[3] "A novel approach is described for preparing Ga-promoted Pt particles for the dehydrogenation of light alkanes to alkenes. The modifying element, Ga, was introduced by transference from the support, a calcined Mg(Ga)(Al)O hydrotalcite-like material."

[4] "The activity, selectivity and stability of Pt/Mg(Ga)(Al)O catalysts for ethane and propane dehydrogenation are described in the second part of this study"

The literature primarily focuses on platinum-based catalysts for light olefin dehydrogenation, particularly those promoted with other elements like gallium. It does not provide a direct comparison with metal oxide-based catalysts like CrOx, indium, vanadium, zinc, and molybdenum oxides.

Based on the information provided:

1. Composition: The main catalyst discussed is platinum, promoted with elements like Ga, Sn, Zn, Ge, Pb, and Re. The specific focus is on a novel Ga-promoted Pt catalyst supported on Mg(Ga)(Al)O.

2. Effectiveness: Platinum is described as an active catalyst for light alkane dehydrogenation. However, without modifiers, it suffers from low alkene selectivity and rapid deactivation due to coke formation. Promoting Pt with elements like Ga can increase alkene selectivity and decrease coke formation.

3. Industrial applications: The catalysts are used for the dehydrogenation of light alkanes (such as ethane and propane) to produce light alkenes (ethylene, propylene, n-butene). These light alkenes are important building blocks for commodity chemicals and polymers.

4. Recent developments: The paper describes a novel approach for preparing Ga-promoted Pt particles, where Ga is introduced by transference from the support material.

5. Potential advantages: The Ga-promoted Pt catalysts on Mg(Ga)(Al)O support appear to offer improved selectivity and stability compared to unpromoted Pt catalysts. However, the paper does not provide direct comparisons with metal oxide-based catalysts to assess relative advantages.

The literature does not provide sufficient information to compare these Pt-based catalysts with metal oxide-based catalysts like CrOx, indium, vanadium, zinc, and molybdenum oxides in terms of their effectiveness, industrial applications, or potential advantages.

该文献主要关注了用于轻质烯烃脱氢的铂基催化剂，特别是那些由其他元素如镓促进的催化剂。它没有直接与金属氧化物基催化剂（如CrOx、铟、钒、锌和钼氧化物）进行比较。

根据提供的信息：

1. 成分：讨论的主要催化剂是铂，由Ga、Sn、Zn、Ge、Pb和Re等元素促进。特别关注的是一种新型的Ga促进的Pt催化剂，以Mg(Ga)(Al)O为载体。

2. 有效性：铂被描述为轻烷烃脱氢的活性催化剂。然而，在没有改性剂的情况下，它会因快速积碳而导致烯烃选择性低和快速失活。用Ga等元素促进Pt可以提高烯烃选择性并减少积碳形成。

3. 工业应用：这些催化剂用于轻烷烃（如乙烷和丙烷）的脱氢，生产轻烯烃（乙烯、丙烯、正丁烯）。这些轻烯烃是商品化学品和聚合物的重要构建块。

4. 最新发展：该文描述了一种制备Ga促进的Pt粒子的新方法，其中Ga通过从载体材料转移引入。

5. 潜在优势：Mg(Ga)(Al)O载体上的Ga促进的Pt催化剂似乎比未促进的Pt催化剂提供了更好的选择性和稳定性。然而，该文没有提供与金属氧化物基催化剂的直接比较，无法评估相对优势。

文献没有提供足够的信息来比较这些Pt基催化剂与金属氧化物基催化剂（如CrOx、铟、钒、锌和钼氧化物）在有效性、工业应用或潜在优势方面的差异。
