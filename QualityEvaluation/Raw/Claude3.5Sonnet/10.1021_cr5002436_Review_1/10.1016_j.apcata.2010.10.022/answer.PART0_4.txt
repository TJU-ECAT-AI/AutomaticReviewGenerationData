[1] "Typically, PtSn supported on alumina or Cr2O3 supported on alumina or zirconia are the commercial catalysts for this reaction [1,2]."

[2] "A variety of Pt catalysts, often promoted with other electropositive metals and supported on various carriers (e.g., SiO2 [3], ZSM5 [4,5], L-zeolite [6], SBA-15 [2,5,7], Y-zeolite [6], MOR [6], Beta [6,8], and Mg(Al)O [9]), were investigated for the dehydrogenation of propane to propylene reaction in an effort to find an optimum catalyst."

[3] "Biscardi and Iglesia [15] investigated the elementary reaction steps of propane dehydrogenation over H-ZSM5 and Ga/H-ZSM5 catalysts using an equimolar mixture of C3H8/C3D8."

The literature provides limited information to fully compare and contrast noble metal-based catalysts and metal oxide-based catalysts for light olefin dehydrogenation. However, some key points can be extracted:

1. Platinum-based catalysts are widely used for propane dehydrogenation. The most common commercial catalysts are PtSn supported on alumina.

2. Chromium oxide (Cr2O3) supported on alumina or zirconia is another commercial catalyst for propane dehydrogenation.

3. Various supports have been investigated for Pt catalysts, including SiO2, different types of zeolites (ZSM5, L-zeolite, Y-zeolite, MOR, Beta), SBA-15, and Mg(Al)O. This suggests ongoing research to optimize Pt-based catalysts.

4. Pt catalysts are often promoted with other electropositive metals to enhance performance.

5. Some metal oxide catalysts, such as gallium-modified zeolites (Ga/H-ZSM5), have also been studied for propane dehydrogenation.

The document does not provide sufficient information to compare the effectiveness, industrial applications, or recent developments of these different catalyst types. More comprehensive literature would be needed to fully address the question.

该文献提供的信息有限，无法全面比较和对比用于轻质烯烃脱氢的贵金属基催化剂和金属氧化物基催化剂。然而，可以提取一些关键点：

1. 铂基催化剂广泛用于丙烷脱氢。最常见的商业催化剂是氧化铝负载的PtSn。

2. 氧化铝或氧化锆负载的三氧化铬（Cr2O3）是另一种用于丙烷脱氢的商业催化剂。

3. 已研究了各种铂催化剂的载体，包括SiO2、不同类型的沸石（ZSM5、L-沸石、Y-沸石、MOR、Beta）、SBA-15和Mg(Al)O。这表明正在进行优化铂基催化剂的研究。

4. 铂催化剂通常与其他电正性金属一起使用，以增强性能。

5. 一些金属氧化物催化剂，如镓改性沸石（Ga/H-ZSM5），也已被研究用于丙烷脱氢。

该文档没有提供足够的信息来比较这些不同类型催化剂的有效性、工业应用或最新发展。需要更全面的文献才能充分回答这个问题。
