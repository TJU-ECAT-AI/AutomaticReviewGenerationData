[1] "Typically, PtSn supported on alumina or Cr2O3 supported on alumina or zirconia are the commercial catalysts for this reaction [1,2]."

[2] "A variety of Pt catalysts, often promoted with other electropositive metals and supported on various carriers (e.g., SiO2 [3], ZSM5 [4,5], L-zeolite [6], SBA-15 [2,5,7], Y-zeolite [6], MOR [6], Beta [6,8], and Mg(Al)O [9]), were investigated for the dehydrogenation of propane to propylene reaction in an effort to find an optimum catalyst."

[3] "Biscardi and Iglesia [15] investigated the elementary reaction steps of propane dehydrogenation over H-ZSM5 and Ga/H-ZSM5 catalysts using an equimolar mixture of C3H8/C3D8."

The literature provides limited information to fully compare and contrast noble metal-based catalysts and metal oxide-based catalysts for light olefin dehydrogenation. However, based on the available information:

1. Composition: Noble metal catalysts typically use platinum, often promoted with other metals like tin (PtSn). Metal oxide catalysts mentioned include chromium oxide (Cr2O3) and gallium oxide (in Ga/H-ZSM5).

2. Supports: Both types of catalysts use various supports. For noble metals, supports include alumina, silica, and various zeolites (ZSM5, L-zeolite, Y-zeolite, MOR, Beta) and mesoporous materials (SBA-15). For metal oxides, alumina and zirconia are mentioned as supports for Cr2O3.

3. Industrial applications: PtSn supported on alumina and Cr2O3 supported on alumina or zirconia are described as commercial catalysts for propane dehydrogenation.

4. Recent developments: The literature discusses ongoing research into various Pt-based catalysts on different supports to optimize catalyst performance for propane dehydrogenation.

5. Effectiveness: The document does not provide direct comparisons of effectiveness between noble metal and metal oxide catalysts.

The literature does not provide sufficient information to discuss potential advantages or recent developments for all the metal oxide catalysts mentioned in the question (indium, vanadium, zinc, and molybdenum oxides).

该文献提供的信息有限，无法全面比较和对比用于轻质烯烃脱氢的贵金属基催化剂和金属氧化物基催化剂。但根据可用信息：

1. 组成：贵金属催化剂通常使用铂，常常与其他金属如锡(PtSn)一起使用。提到的金属氧化物催化剂包括氧化铬(Cr2O3)和氧化镓(在Ga/H-ZSM5中)。

2. 载体：两种类型的催化剂都使用各种载体。对于贵金属，载体包括氧化铝、二氧化硅和各种沸石(ZSM5、L-沸石、Y-沸石、MOR、Beta)以及介孔材料(SBA-15)。对于金属氧化物，提到氧化铝和氧化锆作为Cr2O3的载体。

3. 工业应用：将PtSn负载在氧化铝上和Cr2O3负载在氧化铝或氧化锆上被描述为丙烷脱氢的商业催化剂。

4. 最新发展：文献讨论了对不同载体上各种基于Pt的催化剂的持续研究，以优化催化剂在丙烷脱氢中的性能。

5. 有效性：文档没有提供贵金属和金属氧化物催化剂之间有效性的直接比较。

文献没有提供足够的信息来讨论问题中提到的所有金属氧化物催化剂(铟、钒、锌和钼氧化物)的潜在优势或最新发展。
