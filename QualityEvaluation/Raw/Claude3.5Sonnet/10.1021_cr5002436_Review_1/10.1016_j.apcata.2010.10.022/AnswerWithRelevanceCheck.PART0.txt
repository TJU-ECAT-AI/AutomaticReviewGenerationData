          [1] "Typically, PtSn supported on alumina or Cr2O3 supported on alumina or zirconia are the commercial catalysts for this reaction [1,2]."

[2] "A variety of Pt catalysts, often promoted with other electropositive metals and supported on various carriers (e.g., SiO2 [3], ZSM5 [4,5], L-zeolite [6], SBA-15 [2,5,7], Y-zeolite [6], MOR [6], Beta [6,8], and Mg(Al)O [9]), were investigated for the dehydrogenation of propane to propylene reaction in an effort to find an optimum catalyst."

[3] "Biscardi and Iglesia [15] investigated the elementary reaction steps of propane dehydrogenation over H-ZSM5 and Ga/H-ZSM5 catalysts using an equimolar mixture of C3H8/C3D8."

[4] "Jackson et al. [14] studied the dehydrogenation of propane using a C3H8/C3D8 mixture on chromia and found an NKIE of 1.85; thus, C-H bond activation was identified to be the rate determining step."

          The literature provides information on noble metal-based catalysts (particularly Platinum) and some metal oxide-based catalysts used in the nonoxidative dehydrogenation of light olefins, though it does not cover all the metal oxides mentioned in the question.

Compositions: Noble metal catalysts typically use platinum, often promoted with other metals like tin (PtSn). Metal oxide catalysts mentioned include chromium oxide (Cr2O3) and gallium oxide (in Ga/H-ZSM5).

Supports: Both types of catalysts use various supports. For noble metals, supports include alumina, silica, various zeolites (ZSM5, L-zeolite, Y-zeolite, MOR, Beta), SBA-15, and Mg(Al)O. For metal oxides, alumina and zirconia are mentioned as supports for Cr2O3.

Effectiveness: The document doesn't provide direct comparisons of effectiveness between noble metal and metal oxide catalysts. However, it mentions ongoing research to find optimal catalysts, suggesting efforts to improve effectiveness.

Industrial applications: PtSn supported on alumina and Cr2O3 supported on alumina or zirconia are described as commercial catalysts for propane dehydrogenation.

Recent developments: The literature discusses ongoing research into various Pt-based catalysts on different supports to optimize catalyst performance. It also mentions the use of isotope labeling techniques to investigate reaction mechanisms and rate-determining steps for different catalysts.

Potential advantages: The text does not provide direct comparisons of advantages between noble metal and metal oxide catalysts. However, the wide range of supports investigated for Pt catalysts suggests flexibility in tuning catalyst properties.

The literature does not provide sufficient information to discuss other metal oxide catalysts like indium, vanadium, zinc, or molybdenum oxides in this context.

          文献提供了关于用于轻质烯烃非氧化脱氢的贵金属基催化剂（特别是铂）和一些金属氧化物基催化剂的信息，但并未涵盖问题中提到的所有金属氧化物。

成分：贵金属催化剂通常使用铂，经常与其他金属如锡(PtSn)一起促进。提到的金属氧化物催化剂包括氧化铬(Cr2O3)和氧化镓(在Ga/H-ZSM5中)。

载体：两种类型的催化剂都使用各种载体。对于贵金属，载体包括氧化铝、二氧化硅、各种沸石(ZSM5、L-沸石、Y-沸石、MOR、Beta)、SBA-15和Mg(Al)O。对于金属氧化物，提到氧化铝和氧化锆作为Cr2O3的载体。

有效性：文献没有提供贵金属和金属氧化物催化剂之间有效性的直接比较。然而，它提到了正在进行寻找最佳催化剂的研究，表明正在努力提高有效性。

工业应用：将PtSn负载在氧化铝上和Cr2O3负载在氧化铝或氧化锆上被描述为丙烷脱氢的商业催化剂。

最新发展：文献讨论了对不同载体上各种基于Pt的催化剂的持续研究，以优化催化剂性能。它还提到使用同位素标记技术来研究不同催化剂的反应机理和速率限制步骤。

潜在优势：文本没有直接比较贵金属和金属氧化物催化剂的优势。然而，为铂催化剂研究的广泛载体范围表明在调整催化剂性能方面具有灵活性。

文献没有提供足够的信息来讨论其他金属氧化物催化剂，如铟、钒、锌或钼氧化物在这方面的情况。
