[1] "Typically, PtSn supported on alumina or Cr2O3 supported on alumina or zirconia are the commercial catalysts for this reaction [1,2]."

[2] "A variety of Pt catalysts, often promoted with other electropositive metals and supported on various carriers (e.g., SiO2 [3], ZSM5 [4,5], L-zeolite [6], SBA-15 [2,5,7], Y-zeolite [6], MOR [6], Beta [6,8], and Mg(Al)O [9]), were investigated for the dehydrogenation of propane to propylene reaction in an effort to find an optimum catalyst."

[3] "Biscardi and Iglesia [15] investigated the elementary reaction steps of propane dehydrogenation over H-ZSM5 and Ga/H-ZSM5 catalysts using an equimolar mixture of C3H8/C3D8."

The literature provides limited information to fully compare and contrast noble metal-based catalysts and metal oxide-based catalysts for light olefin dehydrogenation. However, some insights can be drawn:

1. Compositions: Platinum-based catalysts are commonly used, often promoted with other metals like Sn and supported on various carriers such as alumina, silica, and different zeolites (ZSM5, L-zeolite, Y-zeolite, MOR, Beta). For metal oxide catalysts, chromium oxide (Cr2O3) supported on alumina or zirconia is mentioned as a commercial catalyst. Gallium-modified zeolites (Ga/H-ZSM5) are also discussed.

2. Effectiveness and industrial applications: Both PtSn/alumina and Cr2O3/alumina or Cr2O3/zirconia are described as commercial catalysts for propane dehydrogenation, suggesting they are effective and industrially relevant.

3. Recent developments: The literature mentions ongoing research to find optimal catalysts, including investigations of various Pt-based catalysts on different supports. This suggests active development in the field, particularly for noble metal catalysts.

4. Potential advantages: The text does not provide direct comparisons of advantages between noble metal and metal oxide catalysts. However, the wide range of supports investigated for Pt catalysts suggests flexibility in tuning catalyst properties.

The literature does not provide sufficient information to discuss other metal oxide catalysts like indium, vanadium, zinc, or molybdenum oxides in this context.

文献提供的信息有限，无法全面比较和对比用于轻质烯烃脱氢的贵金属基催化剂和金属氧化物基催化剂。然而，可以得出一些见解：

1. 组成：铂基催化剂常被使用，通常与其他金属如Sn一起促进，并负载在各种载体上，如氧化铝、二氧化硅和不同的沸石（ZSM5、L-沸石、Y-沸石、MOR、Beta）。对于金属氧化物催化剂，氧化铬（Cr2O3）负载在氧化铝或氧化锆上被提及为商业催化剂。还讨论了镓改性沸石（Ga/H-ZSM5）。

2. 有效性和工业应用：PtSn/氧化铝和Cr2O3/氧化铝或Cr2O3/氧化锆都被描述为丙烷脱氢的商业催化剂，表明它们是有效的且具有工业相关性。

3. 最新发展：文献提到正在进行寻找最佳催化剂的研究，包括对各种不同载体上的铂基催化剂的研究。这表明该领域正在积极发展，特别是贵金属催化剂。

4. 潜在优势：文本没有直接比较贵金属和金属氧化物催化剂的优势。然而，为铂催化剂研究的广泛载体范围表明在调整催化剂性能方面具有灵活性。

文献没有提供足够的信息来讨论其他金属氧化物催化剂，如铟、钒、锌或钼氧化物在这方面的情况。
