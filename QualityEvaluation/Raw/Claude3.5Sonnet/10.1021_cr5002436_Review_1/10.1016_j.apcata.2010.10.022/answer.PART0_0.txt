[1] "Typically, Pt-Sn supported on alumina or Cr2O3 supported on alumina or zirconia are the commercial catalysts for this reaction [1,2]."

[2] "A variety of Pt catalysts, often promoted with other electropositive metals and supported on various carriers (e.g., SiO2 [3], ZSM-5 [4,5], L-zeolite [6], SBA-15 [2,5,7], Y-zeolite [6], MOR [6], Beta [6,8], and Mg(Al)O [9]), were investigated for the dehydrogenation of propane to propylene reaction in an effort to find an optimum catalyst."

[3] "Jackson et al. [14] studied the dehydrogenation of propane using a C3H8/C3D8 mixture on chromia and found an NKIE of 1.85; thus, C-H bond activation was identified to be the rate determining step."

[4] "Biscardi and Iglesia [15] investigated the elementary reaction steps of propane dehydrogenation over H-ZSM-5 and Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts using an equimolar mixture of C3H8/C3D8. At a temperature of 500 °C, an NKIE of 1.03 and 1.2 for H-ZSM-5 and Ga/H-ZSM-5, respectively, were reported and significant H-D cross-exchange between C3H8 and C3D8 in the recovered propane was observed."

The literature provides some information on noble metal-based catalysts (particularly Platinum) and metal oxide-based catalysts used in the nonoxidative dehydrogenation of light olefins, but it does not provide a comprehensive comparison of all the catalysts mentioned in the question.

Compositions: The document mentions Pt-Sn supported on alumina, Cr2O3 supported on alumina or zirconia as commercial catalysts. It also mentions various Pt catalysts promoted with other electropositive metals and supported on different carriers such as SiO2, ZSM-5, L-zeolite, SBA-15, Y-zeolite, MOR, Beta, and Mg(Al)O. Additionally, H-ZSM-5 and Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts are mentioned.

Effectiveness: The literature does not provide direct comparisons of effectiveness between noble metal-based and metal oxide-based catalysts. However, it mentions that various Pt catalysts were investigated to find an optimum catalyst, suggesting ongoing research to improve effectiveness.

Industrial applications: The document states that Pt-Sn supported on alumina and Cr2O3 supported on alumina or zirconia are commercial catalysts for propane dehydrogenation.

Recent developments: The literature discusses the use of isotope labeling techniques to investigate reaction mechanisms and rate-determining steps for different catalysts. This suggests ongoing research to understand and improve catalyst performance.

Potential advantages: The document does not explicitly discuss potential advantages of different catalyst types. However, the research into various Pt catalysts with different supports and promoters suggests efforts to optimize catalyst performance.

It's important to note that the document does not provide information on some of the metal oxide catalysts mentioned in the question (indium, vanadium, zinc, and molybdenum oxides), limiting the ability to make a comprehensive comparison.
