[1] "Typically, Pt-Sn supported on alumina or Cr2O3 supported on alumina or zirconia are the commercial catalysts for this reaction [1,2]."

[2] "A variety of Pt catalysts, often promoted with other electropositive metals and supported on various carriers (e.g., SiO2 [3], ZSM-5 [4,5], L-zeolite [6], SBA-15 [2,5,7], Y-zeolite [6], MOR [6], Beta [6,8], and Mg(Al)O [9]), were investigated for the dehydrogenation of propane to propylene reaction in an effort to find an optimum catalyst."

[3] "Jackson et al. [14] studied the dehydrogenation of propane using a C3H8/C3D8 mixture on chromia and found an NKIE of 1.85; thus, C-H bond activation was identified to be the rate determining step."

[4] "Biscardi and Iglesia [15] investigated the elementary reaction steps of propane dehydrogenation over H-ZSM-5 and Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts using an equimolar mixture of C3H8/C3D8. At a temperature of 500 °C, an NKIE of 1.03 and 1.2 for H-ZSM-5 and Ga/H-ZSM-5, respectively, were reported and significant H-D cross-exchange between C3H8 and C3D8 in the recovered propane was observed."
