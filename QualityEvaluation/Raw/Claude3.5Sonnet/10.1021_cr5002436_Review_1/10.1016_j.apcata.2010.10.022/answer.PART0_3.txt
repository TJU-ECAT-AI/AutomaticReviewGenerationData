[1] "Typically, PtSn supported on alumina or Cr2O3 supported on alumina or zirconia are the commercial catalysts for this reaction [1,2]."

[2] "A variety of Pt catalysts, often promoted with other electropositive metals and supported on various carriers (e.g., SiO2 [3], ZSM5 [4,5], L-zeolite [6], SBA-15 [2,5,7], Y-zeolite [6], MOR [6], Beta [6,8], and Mg(Al)O [9]), were investigated for the dehydrogenation of propane to propylene reaction in an effort to find an optimum catalyst."

[3] "Biscardi and Iglesia [15] investigated the elementary reaction steps of propane dehydrogenation over H-ZSM5 and Ga/H-ZSM5 catalysts using an equimolar mixture of C3H8/C3D8."

The literature provides limited information to fully compare and contrast noble metal-based catalysts and metal oxide-based catalysts for light olefin dehydrogenation. However, based on the available information:

1. Compositions: Noble metal catalysts are typically platinum-based, often promoted with other metals like tin (PtSn). Metal oxide catalysts mentioned include chromium oxide (Cr2O3) and gallium oxide (as part of Ga/H-ZSM5).

2. Supports: Both types of catalysts use various supports. For Pt catalysts, supports include alumina, silica, various zeolites (ZSM5, L-zeolite, Y-zeolite, MOR, Beta), SBA-15, and Mg(Al)O. Cr2O3 is supported on alumina or zirconia.

3. Industrial applications: PtSn/alumina and Cr2O3/alumina or Cr2O3/zirconia are mentioned as commercial catalysts for propane dehydrogenation.

4. Recent developments: The literature discusses ongoing research to find optimal catalysts, including investigations of various Pt-based catalysts on different supports.

5. Effectiveness: The document doesn't provide direct comparisons of effectiveness between noble metal and metal oxide catalysts.

The literature does not provide sufficient information to discuss potential advantages of these catalysts in the field or to make comprehensive comparisons between the two types.

文献提供的信息有限，无法全面比较和对比用于轻质烯烃脱氢的贵金属基催化剂和金属氧化物基催化剂。然而，根据可用信息：

1. 成分：贵金属催化剂通常以铂为基础，经常与锡等其他金属共同促进（PtSn）。提到的金属氧化物催化剂包括氧化铬（Cr2O3）和氧化镓（作为Ga/H-ZSM5的一部分）。

2. 载体：两种类型的催化剂都使用各种载体。对于Pt催化剂，载体包括氧化铝、二氧化硅、各种沸石（ZSM5、L-沸石、Y-沸石、MOR、Beta）、SBA-15和Mg(Al)O。Cr2O3负载在氧化铝或氧化锆上。

3. 工业应用：PtSn/氧化铝和Cr2O3/氧化铝或Cr2O3/氧化锆被提及为丙烷脱氢的商业催化剂。

4. 最新发展：文献讨论了寻找最佳催化剂的持续研究，包括对不同载体上各种Pt基催化剂的研究。

5. 有效性：文献没有提供贵金属和金属氧化物催化剂之间有效性的直接比较。

文献没有提供足够的信息来讨论这些催化剂在该领域的潜在优势，也无法对这两种类型进行全面比较。
