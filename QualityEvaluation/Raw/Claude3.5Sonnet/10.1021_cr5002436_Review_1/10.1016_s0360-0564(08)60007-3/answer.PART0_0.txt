This document does not contain information about noble metal-based catalysts or metal oxide-based catalysts used in the nonoxidative dehydrogenation of light olefins. The text focuses primarily on adsorption microcalorimetry techniques and their applications in studying various catalysts, but does not specifically discuss the catalysts mentioned in the question or their use in light olefin dehydrogenation. Therefore, I cannot provide a comparison or discussion of these catalysts based on the given text.
