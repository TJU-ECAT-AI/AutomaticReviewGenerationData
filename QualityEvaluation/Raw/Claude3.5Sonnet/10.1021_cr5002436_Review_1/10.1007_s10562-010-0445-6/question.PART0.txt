Abstract
The effect of Na addition to PtSn/AlSBA-15 on the catalytic properties in propane dehydrogenation was studied. The catalysts were characterized by XRF, BET, HR-TEM, NH3-TPD, TPO and TPR. Results showed that the presence of sodium could not only modify the acid function of the catalysts but also the structure of metallic phase, thus reduce the amount of coke deposition. Among the catalysts investigated, PtSnNa (1.0%)/AlSBA-15 had the best catalytic performance in terms of propane conversion and stability. The high catalytic performance may be owing to the strong interaction between metal and support.

1 Introduction
In the last decade, propane dehydrogenation has attained importance due to the increase in the demand for propene. Extensive studies have been made on supported Pt [1] or Cr [2] catalysts. However, the major problems about these catalysts are cracking and coke formation. Cracking decreases propene selectivity and coking leads to catalysts deactivation. As a consequence, a great deal of work has been carried out with the aim of developing catalysts with high catalytic performance.
The platinumtin catalysts have been widely used in reforming or dehydrogenation processes. The role of Sn in PtSn catalysts has been extensively investigated in many studies [39]. It has been proposed that tin modifies the electronic density of Pt, either owing to a positive charge transfer from Snn+ or to the different electronic structure in PtSn alloys [10]. Moreover, tin decreases the size of surface Pt ensembles, reducing hydrogenolysis and coking reactions which require large Pt ensembles. Albeit the interaction between Pt and Sn is a major factor determining the dehydrogenation performance of PtSn catalysts, it can not be seen independently from other factors such as Pt/Sn atomic ratio and preparation method.
The use of SBA-15 is attractive, because it possesses well-ordered pore structure, high thermal stability and high surface area [11]. Recently, SBA-15 as a support has been used in the propane dehydrogenation reaction. Santhosh Kumar et al. [12, 13] studied the propane dehydrogenation performance of Pt and PtSn catalysts supported SBA-15, and found PtSn/SBA-15 exhibited higher propane conversion, superior selectivity to propene and stability than Pt/SBA-15. Fan et al. [14] reported that PtSn catalyst supported on alumina-modified SBA-15 had higher activity than PtSn/SBA-15, which was due to alumina could enhance the interaction between metal and support. However, some Al2O3 layers dispersed in the internal pore of SBA-15, which greatly reduced the surface area, total volume and BJH average diameter of support. AlSBA-15, that is, isomorphous substitution of aluminium into the mesoporous framework of SBA-15 [15], has similar textual properties with its counterpart SBA-15, and been widely used as a catalyst [1618] or catalytic support [1922].
Inhibiting the acid-catalyzed reaction on the support can improve the propane dehydrogenation performance. The acid sites of support containing alumina may be poisoned by adding alkali or alkali earth metal ions [23, 24]. It was reported in the literature [25] that the addition of sodium to PtSn/Al2O3 increased the catalytic performance in the n-butane dehydrogenation reaction, which was attributed to a geometric modification of the metallic phase by the presence of sodium. Siri et al. [26] investigated the effect of sodium promoter on catalytic properties of PtSn/γ-Al2O3 in the isobutene dehydrogenation, and found the addition of sodium improved the stability level of the catalysts. This behavior was explained that Na+ could effectively inhibit the activity of support acid sites.
The goal of the present work was to investigate the modified effect of Na addition to PtSn/AlSBA-15 on the physicochemical characteristics and catalytic behaviors in the propane dehydrogenation. The additive effects of Na were characterized by X-ray fluorescence (XRF), BET, HR-TEM, hydrogen chemisorption, NH3-TPD, temperature-programmed reduction (TPR), temperature-programmed oxidation (TPO). Their catalytic properties were evaluated in a microreactor.
2 Experimental
2.1 Sample Preparation
The mesoporous material SBA-15 and AlSBA-15 (Si/Al = 20) were prepared by a method described in literature [27]. TheAlSBA-15 samples doped with Na in different concentrations(0, 0.5, 1.0 and 1.5 wt%) were obtained by impregnating the support with an aqueous solution of NaCl, using a volume of solution/weight of support ratio of 8.0 mL g1 and a NaCl concentration such as to obtain the desired Na loading on the support. PtSnNa/AlSBA-15 catalysts were prepared by an initial impregnation with NaCl. Then, Pt and Sn were incorporated by coimpregnation. In the case of coimpregnation, H2PtCl6 and SnCl4 were simultaneously added to the impregnating solution. The impregnation volume/support weight ratio was 8.0 mL g1. Finally, the prepared catalysts were dried vacuum evaporation at 80 C. The metal contents in the catalysts were 0.5 wt% Pt, 1.0 wt% Sn, respectively.
Pt/SBA-15 and PtSn/SBA-15 were also prepared as references by impregnation of SBA-15 with the corresponding metallic precursor. The loading of Pt, Sn and Na were 0.5, 1.0 and 1.0 wt%, respectively.
Afterward, the prepared samples were fully agglomerated with 5.0 wt% alumina during the process of pelletization. After being totally dried, the catalysts were calcined at 500 C for 4 h, then dechlorinated at 500 C for 4 h in air containing steam, and finally reduced under H2 at 500 C for 8 h. Catalysts used during this investigation were abbreviated as PtSnNa (x)/AlSBA-15, where x represented the amount of Na in the catalyst (wt%). PtSn/SBA-15 and PtNa/SBA-15 were also prepared in the similar method.
2.2 Catalysts Characterization
The metallic contents were obtained by X-ray fluorescence (XRF) measurements on a SWITZERLAND ARL9800 XRF. The corresponding designation of the different catalysts is exhibited in Table 1.

The nitrogen adsorptiondesorption isotherms were measured at 196 C on a Micromeritics ASAP 2000 apparatus. Before measurements, the samples were degassed at 300 C and 1 × 103 Torr. The pore structural data were analyzed by the BJH (BarrettJoynerHalenda) method using the Halsey equation for multilayer thickness. The pore size distribution curve came from the analysis of the desorption branch of the isotherm.
The platinum dispersion was determined from chemisorption measurements. This experiment was carried out using the dynamic-pulse technique with an argon (99.99%) flow of 50 mL/min and pulses of hydrogen. The experiment process was the same as reported by Dorado et al. [28], except that the sample reduction temperature was 500 C and the temperature of the argon gas for removing the hydrogen was 40 C higher than the reduction temperature.
Surface acidity was measured by NH3-TPD in TP-5000 apparatus at ambient pressure. The sample (150 mg) was preheated at 500 C for 1 h, and then cooled to room temperature in flowing He. At this temperature, sufficient pulses of NH3 were injected until adsorption saturation. TPD was carried out from 100 to 500 C with a heating rate of 10 C/min and with helium (30 mL/min) as the carrier gas.
Temperature-programmed reduction (TPR) was measured in the TP-5000 apparatus. Prior to the TPR experiments, 0.15 g catalyst was dried in flowing He at 100 C for 1 h. 5% H2/He was used as the reducing gas at a flow rate of 40 mL/min. The rate of temperature rise was 10 C/min up to 800 C.
TPO was also measured with the apparatus the same as NH3-TPD. About 0.15 g of coked sample was placed in a quartz reactor at room temperature, then heated to 800 C at a rate of 10 C/min in a 5% O2/He mixture (30 mL/min).
The Pt metal dispersion on support was verified using a JEM 2010 high-resolution transmission electron microscope (TEM) equipped with energy dispersive spectroscopy. Samples were prepared by grinding, suspending and sonicating them in ethanol and placing a drop of the suspension on a copper grid with a perforated carbon film.
2.3 Catalytic Tests
The catalytic dehydrogenation reaction was performed in a stainless fixed bed tubular reactor at 590 C and atmospheric pressure using a catalyst charge of 1.0 g.
The propane weight hourly space velocity (WHSV) was 3 h1, and the mole ratio of H2/C3H8 was 0.25. The reaction products were analyzed with an online GC-14C gas chromatograph equipped with an activated alumina packed column and a flame ionization detector (FID). The conversion of propane (X) is defined as the percentage of propane converted to all different products. The selectivity to propylene (S) is defined as the amount of propylene obtained divided by the amount of reactant converted to all products.
3 Results and Discussion
3.1 Catalysts Characterization
Figure 1a shows the nitrogen adsorptiondesorption isotherms of SBA-15 and different catalysts. SBA-15 exhibits type IV adsorptiondesorption isotherm, which is characteristic of mesoporous materials. Furthermore, the adsorptiondesorption isotherms of the different catalysts are similar to that of SBA-15. This clearly indicates that the mesoporous structure is maintained well during the process of impregnation. The basic characterization data of different catalysts are listed in Table 1. The PtSn/SBA-15 has high surface area (796 m2/g) and pore volume (1.27 cm3/g), but these properties are decreased after alumina and sodium modification. However, these properties remain high even after modification of alumina and sodium. Figure 1b shows the pore diameter distribution of SBA-15 and different catalysts determined by the BJH model applied to the desorption branch of the isotherms. The pore size distribution of PtSn/AlSBA-15 is shifted to smaller diameter by sodium modification. This result suggests that part of Na+ may be embedded in the pore walls of SBA-15.

The Pt dispersions on the different catalysts are measured by using H2 chemisorption and listed in the Table 1. Among these catalysts, the lowest Pt dispersion was observed for PtSn/SBA-15. The Pt dispersion of PtSn/AlSBA-15 increases by 3.3% compared to that of PtSn/SBA-15, implying that the presence of alumina is beneficial for improving the Pt dispersion. In addition, it is interesting to note that Pt dispersion of PtSn/AlSBA-15 catalyst increases with the suitable addition of Na, while the opposite effect is observed when the Na loading is excess. This indicates that the amount of Na can have an obvious influence on the surface character of Pt particles that would produce a significant effect on the catalytic behaviors, which will be discussed in the following section. The HR-TEM images of PtSnNa (1.0%)/AlSBA-15 catalyst before and after the reaction are shown in Fig. 2a and b, respectively. The Pt particle is in the range of 15 nm, which is less than the diameter of the support pore mouth, indicating that some of the Pt particles may be located inside the pores of the support. Furthermore, few agglomerations of Pt particles on the surface of the supports can been found in both images, which means that most Pt particles are homogeneously distributed.

The desorption of NH3 is used to characterize the acidic properties of surface. This technique can provided some information about the amount and strength of acidic sites. The NH3-TPD profiles of different catalysts are displayed in Fig. 3. As known, AlSBA-15 based catalysts show lower temperature peaks at about 180 C related to mild acid sites, whereas the desorption peaks of NH3 are too broadened to be detected at a temperature higher than 300 C corresponding to strong acid sites [27]. TPD plots of PtSn/SBA-15 and PtSn/AlSBA-15 show that there is a substantial increase in acidity and acid strength after Al incorporation. The acidity of PtSnNa/AlSBA-15 decreases distinctly with increase in sodium content. When the sodium content exceeds 1.0%, almost no NH3 desorption at higher temperature appears. This result clearly indicates that sodium can neutralize the strong acidic sites of the catalysts effectively, which is consistent with the results of prior research [29, 30].

3.2 H2-TPR
The reduction behavior of the surface species on a catalyst can be characterized by H2-TPR. In this paper, TPR measurements are used to characterize the reduction of Pt and Sn species as well as the interaction between metal and support. TPR profiles of different catalysts are shown in Fig. 4. The Pt/SBA-15 and PtSn/SBA-15 catalysts as references are also included in the figure. There are no obvious reduction peaks for Pt/SBA-15 during the reduction process. This reveals that Pt species has been completely reduced to Pt0 species during the calcinations stage previously. PtSn/SBA-15 exhibits one reduction peak around 360 C, which can be attributed to the reduction of Sn4+. Compared to PtSn/SBA-15, PtSn/AlSBA-15 has a reduction temperature of Sn4+ that moves towards higher region, implying that the presence of Al could lead to a higher interaction of the support with tin oxides, which is in consistent with Fan et al. [14].

However, with increasing Na loading, the profiles of catalysts have two peaks, the first reduction zone could be assigned to the partial formation of Sn2+ species from the reduction of Sn4+, while the latter can be associated with the reduction of Sn2+ species to form Sn0 species [31]. It is clear that the first reduction peak for PtSnNa/AlSBA-15 shifts to lower temperature and at the same time the second peak area increases with the increase of Na loading, especially for PtSnNa (1.5%)/AlSBA-15. This phenomenon can account for the facts: the presence of sodium could result in a lower interaction of the support with tin oxides, which significantly promotes the reduction of tin species. It should be noted that the second reduction peak area of PtSnNa (1.0%)/AlSBA-15 increases slightly, yet for PtSnNa (1.5%)/AlSBA-15 the increase is higher, in comparison to PtSn/AlSBA-15. Thus, when the sodium content exceeds 1.0%, the reduction of Sn species to Sn0 becomes easy and the possibility of PtSn alloy increases dramatically. The formation of PtSn alloy can lead to the permanent deactivation of the catalyst and may also be the reason for a decrease in metal dispersion.
3.3 Coke Analysis
TPO measurements are used to characterize the location and amount of coke deposition on catalyst surface. Figure 5 shows the TPO profiles of different catalysts. No combustion peak can be observed in the TPO profile of PtSn/SBA-15 catalyst, indicating that small amount of coke deposition is located over this catalyst. For PtSn/AlSBA-15 catalyst, one great combustion peak appears at about 580 C, corresponding to the coke deposited on the support [32]. Similar results have been reported by Fan et al. [14]. Comparing with PtSn/AlSBA-15, the oxidation peak areas of PtSnNa/AlSBA-15 catalysts decrease greatly with the increase of sodium loading. This becomes more obvious for PtSnNa (1.5%)/AlSBA-15, suggesting that sodium can remarkably inhibit the carbonaceous deposits on catalysts. As known, the coke deposited is mainly produced by the polymerization of olefins formed during the dehydrogenation process. The polymerization is always catalyzed by acid and metal sites. Based on the results of NH3-TPD, the strong acid sites of PtSn/AlSBA-15 catalysts are neutralized by sodium, which leads to the diminution of acidity. TPR results show that with the sodium loading, Sn species can be partial reduced to Sn0, which may be alloyed with Pt. The PtSn alloy formation leads to an increase in the electronic density of surface Pt [33], which could not readily form the multiple carbonmetal bonds and repulse the coke precursors. The modification of catalyst structure by sodium addition can reduce the carbon deposition significantly.

Coke deposition of PtSn catalysts is one of the important factors which influence catalytic deactivation. Generally, when coke is sited on the surface of active metal, it can cover the active sites of Pt particles; while on the support, some pores of catalysts even be blocked. As mentioned above, the amount of coke over the PtSnNa/AlSBA-15 drops precipitously compared with PtSn/AlSBA-15. This indicates that the resistance to coke can be dramatically enhanced by the presence of sodium.
3.4 The Performance of the Catalysts
The performance of the catalysts in propane dehydrogenation is shown in Fig. 6. It can be seen that PtSn/SBA-15 catalyst shows the poorest activity. A similar phenomenon has been reported by Barias [6], who found that Sn species can be easily reduced to metallic Sn and in close contact with Pt when supported on SiO2 rather than on Al2O3, thus decreasing catalytic activity. Addition of alumina to PtSn/SBA-15 results in higher propane initial conversion, accompanied by higher propene selectivity as well. There results are in agreement with Fan et al., who reported that the PtSn catalyst supported on SBA-15 modified by alumina had higher activity than the PtSn/SBA-15 catalyst. When 0.5 wt% sodium is added to the PtSn/AlSBA-15, there is an obvious increase of the catalytic activity (initial conversion is 26.4%, and final conversion is 12.6%). A maximum of 27.5% initial conversion arises at a sodium content of 1.0%. With more increasing sodium loading, the dehydrogenation activity decreases. This behavior may be attributed to the Pt dispersion. Results achieved at a higher conversion level turn out the increase of dehydrogenation activity owing to the high Pt dispersion prompted by proper amount of sodium addition to PtSn/AlSBA-15. However, an excess of sodium loading leads to the decrease in the catalytic activity, which is due to relatively lower dispersion of Pt particles. These results are in agree with Santhosh Kumar [12], who has reported that Pt/SBA-15 catalyst with high Pt dispersion is more active than that with lower dispersion for propane dehydrogenation reaction.

Full size image
Figure 6b shows propene selectivity versus reaction time for the different catalysts. It can be observed that the selectivity to propene remains approximately constant over each catalyst except for PtSn/SBA-15 and PtSnNa (1.5%)/AlSBA-15. This phenomenon can be explained as following: the dehydrogenation catalysts possess an important density of cracking and hydrogenolysis sites on the metal, which are active for CC bond activation, thus produce methane, ethane, ethene. TPO results show small amount of coke deposition is sited on the metal, which may be the main factor responsible for the approximately constant selectivity to propene. As for PtSn/SBA-15 and PtSnNa (1.5%)/AlSBA-15, the case is complex. It has been reported that there are two kinds of active Pt species on the surface of PtSn catalysts, M1 sites and M2 sites [34]. M1 site are the sites in which Pt species directly anchors on the support surface, accountable for the side reaction. While M2 sites correspond to the sites in which Pt anchors Sn oxide surface, responsible for the dehydrogenation reaction. As mentioned previously, tin species of PtSn/SBA-15 and PtSnNa (1.5%)/AlSBA-15 are more easily reduced than any other catalyst, which can destroy the initial M2 sites and make the Pt species anchor on the support directly. In other words, the proportion of M1 sites increases, while the proportion of M2 sites decreases, which results in the decrease of selectivity to propene.
Table 2 exhibits the percentage of deactivation after 7 h on stream for the catalysts studied. The deactivation parameter (D) along the reaction time is defined as: (D) = 100 × (X0  Xf)/X0, where X0 and Xf are the initial and final conversion. The PtSnNa (1.0%)/AlSBA-15 shows the lowest deactivation parameter (36%), and the PtSnNa (1.5%)/AlSBA-15 displays the highest deactivation parameter (55%). It can be observed that an improvement in stability is found upon addition of a small amount of sodium as compared to PtSn/AlSBA-15, whereas too high sodium loading brings out a decrease of stability. The stability of the catalysts decreases in the following sequence: PtSnNa (1.0%)/AlSBA-15 > PtSn/SBA-15 > PtSnNa (0.5%)/AlSBA-15 > PtSn/AlSBA-15 > PtSnNa (1.5%)/AlSBA-15. This phenomenon can be explained as follows: it is well established that platinumtin catalyst is bifunctional and the two active centers (the metal particles and acid sites) may work collaboratively [35]. The propane dehydrogenation reactions require a fine equilibrium between the support acid sites and metal sites. Concerning PtSn/AlSBA-15 catalyst, there must be an optimum ratio between the two kinds of sites. After addition of 1.0% sodium to PtSn/AlSBA-15, the initial matching between the metal function and acid function is enhanced. However, high sodium content seriously destroys the matching between the metal sites and acid sites, therefore, the interaction of Pt with AlSBA-15 or SnO x -AlSBA-15 is weakened.

To verify the stability of PtSnNa (1.0%)/AlSBA-15 catalyst, a long test has been carried out at the temperature of 590 C. The propane conversion and selectivity to propylene as a function of the reaction time are shown in Fig. 7. It can be seen that propane conversion decreases relatively fast at the beginning, and, after an initial stage, the conversion decreases slightly. The selectivity to propylene is higher than 94% during the course of reaction for 40 h.

4 Conclusion
A great improvement in dehydrogenation activity was achieved over PtSnNa/AlSBA-15. However, the performance of sodium modified PtSn/AlSBA-15 was strongly depended on the sodium content. High catalytic performance and the lowest activity loss were obtained over PtSnNa (1.0%)/AlSBA-15.
The presence of sodium modified the properties of the Pt metal phase. The Pt dispersion, combined with interaction between metal and support, were effected by the sodium content,which may be responsible for catalytic properties. The sodium existence also neutralized the strong acidic sites of catalysts, thus reduced the formation of coke effectively. However, the incorporation of excessive sodium prompted the reduction of Sn species to Sn0, which may be alloyed with Pt,leading to a decrease in catalytic activity.
