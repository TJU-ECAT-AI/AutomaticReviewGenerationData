The given literature does not contain information to directly compare and contrast noble metal-based catalysts with metal oxide-based catalysts for light olefin dehydrogenation. The document focuses primarily on platinum-tin catalysts supported on AlSBA-15 for propane dehydrogenation, with emphasis on the effects of sodium addition. It does not discuss other metal oxide catalysts like chromium, gallium, indium, vanadium, zinc or molybdenum oxides.

The literature does provide some relevant information on platinum-based catalysts:

1. Platinum-tin catalysts are widely used in reforming and dehydrogenation processes. 

2. Tin modifies the electronic density of platinum and decreases the size of surface platinum ensembles, reducing undesired side reactions.

3. Supports like SBA-15 and AlSBA-15 are used due to their ordered pore structure, high thermal stability and surface area.

4. Addition of promoters like sodium can modify acidity and metal structure, improving catalyst performance.

5. Key challenges include cracking reactions and coke formation leading to deactivation.

6. Recent developments aim to improve activity, selectivity and stability through tuning metal-support interactions and promoter addition.

However, without information on other catalyst types, a comprehensive comparison cannot be made based solely on this document. A broader literature review would be needed to fully address the question as posed.

给定的文献不包含直接比较和对比用于轻烯烃脱氢的贵金属基催化剂和金属氧化物基催化剂的信息。该文档主要关注AlSBA-15负载的铂-锡催化剂用于丙烷脱氢,重点是添加钠的影响。它没有讨论其他金属氧化物催化剂,如铬、镓、铟、钒、锌或钼氧化物。

文献确实提供了一些关于铂基催化剂的相关信息:

1. 铂-锡催化剂广泛用于重整和脱氢过程。

2. 锡修饰了铂的电子密度,并减小了表面铂集合的尺寸,减少了不需要的副反应。

3. 由于SBA-15和AlSBA-15等载体具有有序的孔结构、高热稳定性和比表面积,因此被使用。

4. 添加钠等助剂可以改变酸性和金属结构,提高催化剂性能。

5. 主要挑战包括导致失活的裂化反应和积碳形成。

6. 最近的发展旨在通过调节金属-载体相互作用和添加助剂来提高活性、选择性和稳定性。

然而,由于缺乏其他类型催化剂的信息,仅基于这份文件无法进行全面的比较。要全面回答所提出的问题,需要进行更广泛的文献综述。

The given literature does not contain information to directly compare and contrast noble metal-based catalysts like platinum with metal oxide-based catalysts such as CrOx, gallium, indium, vanadium, zinc, and molybdenum oxides for light olefin dehydrogenation. The document focuses primarily on platinum-tin catalysts supported on AlSBA-15 for propane dehydrogenation, with a particular emphasis on the effects of sodium addition. It does not discuss other metal oxide catalysts or provide a broad comparison of different catalyst types for light olefin dehydrogenation.

Based solely on the limited information in this document, we can only say that platinum-based catalysts, particularly PtSn supported on modified mesoporous supports like AlSBA-15, show promise for propane dehydrogenation. The addition of promoters like sodium can enhance activity, selectivity, and stability when optimized. However, without additional information on other catalyst types, a comprehensive comparison cannot be made.

To properly address the question, information from other sources covering the various metal oxide catalysts and their properties in light olefin dehydrogenation would be required.

给定的文献没有直接比较和对比贵金属基催化剂(如铂)与金属氧化物基催化剂(如CrOx、镓、铟、钒、锌和钼氧化物)在轻烯烃脱氢反应中的性能。该文档主要集中在AlSBA-15负载的铂-锡催化剂用于丙烷脱氢反应，特别强调了钠添加的影响。它没有讨论其他金属氧化物催化剂，也没有提供不同类型催化剂在轻烯烃脱氢反应中的广泛比较。

仅根据本文档中有限的信息，我们只能说基于铂的催化剂，特别是负载在改性介孔载体(如AlSBA-15)上的PtSn，在丙烷脱氢反应中显示出前景。当优化后，添加钠等助剂可以提高活性、选择性和稳定性。然而，由于缺乏其他类型催化剂的信息，无法进行全面的比较。

要恰当地回答这个问题，需要其他来源的信息，涵盖各种金属氧化物催化剂及其在轻烯烃脱氢反应中的性能。

The document focuses primarily on platinum-tin catalysts supported on AlSBA-15 for propane dehydrogenation, with an emphasis on the effects of sodium addition. It does not discuss other metal oxide catalysts or provide a comprehensive comparison of different catalyst types for light olefin dehydrogenation.

However, based on the limited information provided about platinum-based catalysts in the document, we can infer a few points:

1. Composition: The study examines PtSn catalysts supported on AlSBA-15, with sodium as an additional promoter.

2. Effectiveness: PtSn catalysts show good activity for propane dehydrogenation, with propylene selectivity over 94% maintained for 40 hours in the best-performing catalyst.

3. Recent developments: The research focuses on improving PtSn catalysts by modifying the support (using AlSBA-15) and adding promoters (sodium) to enhance activity, selectivity, and stability.

4. Potential advantages: The platinum-based catalysts studied show high selectivity to propylene and can maintain stability for extended periods with proper modifications.

The document does not provide information on industrial applications or comparisons with other metal oxide catalysts for this reaction.

给定的文献不包含直接比较和对比贵金属基催化剂（特别是铂）与金属氧化物基催化剂（如CrOx、镓、铟、钒、锌和钼氧化物）用于轻烯烃非氧化脱氢的信息。该文档主要关注AlSBA-15负载的铂-锡催化剂用于丙烷脱氢，重点是钠添加的影响。它没有讨论其他金属氧化物催化剂，也没有提供不同类型催化剂用于轻烯烃脱氢的全面比较。

然而，根据文档中提供的有关铂基催化剂的有限信息，我们可以推断出以下几点：

1. 组成：该研究考察了AlSBA-15负载的PtSn催化剂，并以钠作为额外的助剂。

2. 有效性：PtSn催化剂显示出良好的丙烷脱氢活性，在性能最佳的催化剂中，丙烯选择性可在40小时内保持在94%以上。

3. 最新发展：研究重点是通过改性载体（使用AlSBA-15）和添加助剂（钠）来改善PtSn催化剂，以提高活性、选择性和稳定性。

4. 潜在优势：研究的铂基催化剂显示出高丙烯选择性，并且通过适当的改性可以长时间保持稳定性。
