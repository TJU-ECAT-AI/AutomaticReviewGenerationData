<questions>

Compare and contrast the noble metal-based catalysts (particularly Platinum) and metal oxide-based catalysts (such as CrOx, gallium, indium, vanadium, zinc, and molybdenum oxides) used in the nonoxidative dehydrogenation of light olefins. Discuss their compositions, effectiveness, industrial applications, recent developments, and potential advantages in the field.

This literature does not contain information specifically comparing noble metal-based catalysts (like platinum) to metal oxide-based catalysts (such as CrOx, gallium, indium, vanadium, zinc, and molybdenum oxides) for the nonoxidative dehydrogenation of light olefins. The paper focuses on the sintering inhibition mechanism of platinum supported on ceria-based oxide catalysts under oxidizing conditions at high temperatures. It does not discuss metal oxide catalysts or the dehydrogenation of light olefins.

The document primarily covers:
1. The preparation and characterization of Pt/Al2O3 and Pt/CZY (ceria-zirconia-yttria) catalysts
2. Analysis of platinum sintering behavior on different supports
3. Investigation of the Pt-oxide support interaction using techniques like XAFS
4. Explanation of the sintering inhibition mechanism for platinum on ceria-based supports
5. Correlation between support properties and platinum sintering resistance

Without additional information from other sources, I cannot provide a comprehensive comparison of noble metal and metal oxide catalysts for light olefin dehydrogenation as requested in the question.

这篇文献没有具体比较贵金属基催化剂(如铂)和金属氧化物基催化剂(如CrOx、镓、铟、钒、锌和钼氧化物)用于轻烯烃非氧化脱氢的情况。该论文主要关注在高温氧化条件下铈基氧化物负载铂催化剂的烧结抑制机理。它没有讨论金属氧化物催化剂或轻烯烃的脱氢。

该文档主要涵盖以下内容：
1. Pt/Al2O3和Pt/CZY(铈-锆-钇氧化物)催化剂的制备和表征
2. 分析铂在不同载体上的烧结行为
3. 使用XAFS等技术研究铂-氧化物载体相互作用
4. 解释铈基载体上铂的烧结抑制机理
5. 载体性质与铂烧结抗性之间的相关性

没有其他来源的额外信息，我无法就问题中要求的轻烯烃脱氢用贵金属和金属氧化物催化剂进行全面比较。

The given scientific literature does not contain any information directly relevant to comparing noble metal-based catalysts (particularly platinum) and metal oxide-based catalysts for the nonoxidative dehydrogenation of light olefins. The document focuses on platinum catalysts supported on ceria-based oxides and alumina for automotive exhaust purification. It does not discuss catalysts for olefin dehydrogenation or compare platinum with metal oxide catalysts like chromium, gallium, indium, vanadium, zinc, or molybdenum oxides. The literature does not provide information on the compositions, effectiveness, industrial applications, recent developments, or potential advantages of these catalysts in olefin dehydrogenation. Therefore, this specific question cannot be adequately answered based solely on the provided document.
