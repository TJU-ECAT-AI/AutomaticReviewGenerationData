The given literature does not contain information to directly compare noble metal-based catalysts like platinum with metal oxide-based catalysts for light olefin dehydrogenation. The document focuses specifically on platinum-based catalysts supported on silica and L-zeolite for isobutane dehydrogenation. It does not discuss metal oxide catalysts like chromium, gallium, indium, vanadium, zinc or molybdenum oxides.

However, based on the information provided about platinum catalysts, we can infer some aspects:

1. Composition: The study examines Pt, Pt/Sn and Pt/Sn/K catalysts supported on silica and L-zeolite.

2. Effectiveness: Pt/Sn/K catalysts, especially those supported on L-zeolite, showed high selectivity and activity for isobutane dehydrogenation at 873 K with hydrogen present and at 798 K with pure isobutane feed.

3. Industrial applications: The study mentions that 873 K is a typical temperature for commercial isobutane dehydrogenation processes.

4. Recent developments: The research explores the effects of adding Sn and K to Pt catalysts, finding that they improve resistance to coking and enhance selectivity.

5. Potential advantages: Pt-based catalysts, particularly with Sn and K additives, show high selectivity, good activity, and improved resistance to deactivation compared to plain Pt catalysts.

The document does not provide information to compare these aspects with metal oxide-based catalysts.

给定的文献没有直接比较贵金属基催化剂（如铂）与金属氧化物基催化剂在轻烯烃脱氢方面的信息。该文件主要关注以二氧化硅和L沸石为载体的铂基催化剂在异丁烷脱氢中的应用。它没有讨论铬、镓、铟、钒、锌或钼氧化物等金属氧化物催化剂。

然而，根据提供的关于铂催化剂的信息，我们可以推断出一些方面：

1. 成分：该研究考察了以二氧化硅和L沸石为载体的Pt、Pt/Sn和Pt/Sn/K催化剂。

2. 有效性：Pt/Sn/K催化剂，特别是以L沸石为载体的催化剂，在873 K下有氢气存在的情况下以及在798 K下纯异丁烷进料的情况下，都表现出高选择性和活性。

3. 工业应用：该研究提到873 K是商业异丁烷脱氢过程的典型温度。

4. 最新发展：该研究探讨了向Pt催化剂中添加Sn和K的效果，发现它们可以提高抗积碳能力并增强选择性。

5. 潜在优势：铂基催化剂，特别是添加Sn和K的催化剂，与纯Pt催化剂相比，表现出高选择性、良好的活性和更强的抗失活能力。

该文件没有提供与金属氧化物基催化剂比较这些方面的信息。

This literature does not contain information to directly compare noble metal-based catalysts (particularly Platinum) with metal oxide-based catalysts for light olefin dehydrogenation. The document focuses specifically on platinum-based catalysts for isobutane dehydrogenation, particularly Pt/Sn and Pt/Sn/K supported on silica and L-zeolite. It does not discuss metal oxide catalysts like CrOx, gallium, indium, vanadium, zinc, or molybdenum oxides.

However, based on the information provided about the platinum catalysts, we can infer some characteristics:

Composition: The catalysts discussed are mainly Pt/Sn and Pt/Sn/K supported on silica or L-zeolite.

Effectiveness: Pt/Sn/K-L catalysts showed high selectivity for isobutene production at high isobutane conversions, both at 873 K with hydrogen present and at 798 K with pure isobutane feed.

Industrial applications: These catalysts are used for isobutane dehydrogenation to produce isobutene, which is in growing demand.

Recent developments: The addition of Sn and K to Pt catalysts improved resistance to coking and increased selectivity for isobutene production.

Potential advantages: Pt/Sn/K-L catalysts showed higher activity and stability compared to silica-supported catalysts. They maintained activity for longer periods and exhibited better resistance to coking, especially in the presence of hydrogen.

Without information on metal oxide catalysts in this document, a direct comparison cannot be made. To properly compare these catalyst types, additional literature focused on metal oxide catalysts for light olefin dehydrogenation would be needed.

这篇文献没有直接比较贵金属基催化剂(特别是铂)与金属氧化物基催化剂在轻烯烃脱氢方面的信息。该文档主要关注异丁烷脱氢的铂基催化剂,特别是负载在二氧化硅和L型分子筛上的Pt/Sn和Pt/Sn/K催化剂。它没有讨论CrOx、镓、铟、钒、锌或钼氧化物等金属氧化物催化剂。

然而,根据提供的铂催化剂信息,我们可以推断出一些特征:

组成:讨论的催化剂主要是负载在二氧化硅或L型分子筛上的Pt/Sn和Pt/Sn/K。

有效性:Pt/Sn/K-L催化剂在高异丁烷转化率下表现出高选择性的异丁烯生成,无论是在873 K下有氢气存在的情况下,还是在798 K下纯异丁烷进料的情况下。

工业应用:这些催化剂用于异丁烷脱氢生产异丁烯,而异丁烯的需求正在增长。

最新发展:向Pt催化剂中添加Sn和K提高了抗结焦能力,并提高了异丁烯生成的选择性。

潜在优势:与二氧化硅负载的催化剂相比,Pt/Sn/K-L催化剂表现出更高的活性和稳定性。它们能够保持更长时间的活性,并表现出更好的抗结焦能力,特别是在有氢气存在的情况下。

由于本文档中没有关于金属氧化物催化剂的信息,无法进行直接比较。要正确比较这些催化剂类型,需要额外的关于轻烯烃脱氢金属氧化物催化剂的文献。
