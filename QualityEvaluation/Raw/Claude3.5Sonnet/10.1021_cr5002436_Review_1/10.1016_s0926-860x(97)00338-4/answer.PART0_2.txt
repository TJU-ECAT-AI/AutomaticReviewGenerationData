This literature does not contain information to directly compare noble metal-based catalysts (particularly Platinum) with metal oxide-based catalysts for light olefin dehydrogenation. The document focuses specifically on platinum-based catalysts for isobutane dehydrogenation, particularly Pt/Sn and Pt/Sn/K supported on silica and L-zeolite. It does not discuss metal oxide catalysts like CrOx, gallium, indium, vanadium, zinc, or molybdenum oxides.

However, based on the information provided about the platinum catalysts, we can infer some characteristics:

Composition: The catalysts discussed are mainly Pt/Sn and Pt/Sn/K supported on silica or L-zeolite.

Effectiveness: Pt/Sn/K-L catalysts showed high selectivity for isobutene production at high isobutane conversions, both at 873 K with hydrogen present and at 798 K with pure isobutane feed.

Industrial applications: These catalysts are used for isobutane dehydrogenation to produce isobutene, which is in growing demand.

Recent developments: The addition of Sn and K to Pt catalysts improved resistance to coking and increased selectivity for isobutene production.

Potential advantages: Pt/Sn/K-L catalysts showed higher activity and stability compared to silica-supported catalysts. They maintained activity for longer periods and exhibited better resistance to coking, especially in the presence of hydrogen.

Without information on metal oxide catalysts in this document, a direct comparison cannot be made. To properly compare these catalyst types, additional literature focused on metal oxide catalysts for light olefin dehydrogenation would be needed.

这篇文献没有直接比较贵金属基催化剂(特别是铂)与金属氧化物基催化剂在轻烯烃脱氢方面的信息。该文档主要关注异丁烷脱氢的铂基催化剂,特别是负载在二氧化硅和L型分子筛上的Pt/Sn和Pt/Sn/K催化剂。它没有讨论CrOx、镓、铟、钒、锌或钼氧化物等金属氧化物催化剂。

然而,根据提供的铂催化剂信息,我们可以推断出一些特征:

组成:讨论的催化剂主要是负载在二氧化硅或L型分子筛上的Pt/Sn和Pt/Sn/K。

有效性:Pt/Sn/K-L催化剂在高异丁烷转化率下表现出高选择性的异丁烯生成,无论是在873 K下有氢气存在的情况下,还是在798 K下纯异丁烷进料的情况下。

工业应用:这些催化剂用于异丁烷脱氢生产异丁烯,而异丁烯的需求正在增长。

最新发展:向Pt催化剂中添加Sn和K提高了抗结焦能力,并提高了异丁烯生成的选择性。

潜在优势:与二氧化硅负载的催化剂相比,Pt/Sn/K-L催化剂表现出更高的活性和稳定性。它们能够保持更长时间的活性,并表现出更好的抗结焦能力,特别是在有氢气存在的情况下。

由于本文档中没有关于金属氧化物催化剂的信息,无法进行直接比较。要正确比较这些催化剂类型,需要额外的关于轻烯烃脱氢金属氧化物催化剂的文献。
