The provided literature does not contain information to compare and contrast noble metal-based catalysts (particularly Platinum) and metal oxide-based catalysts (such as CrOx, gallium, indium, vanadium, zinc, and molybdenum oxides) used in the nonoxidative dehydrogenation of light olefins. The text focuses specifically on the geometric requirements for hydrocarbon catalytic sites on platinum surfaces, particularly in the context of acetylene transformation. It does not discuss metal oxide-based catalysts or the nonoxidative dehydrogenation of light olefins.

The literature provides detailed information about platinum-based catalysts, including:

1. The use of Pt-based catalysts for hydrocarbon transformations in various industrial applications.
2. The importance of acetylene hydrogenation as an industrial reaction.
3. The geometric requirements for catalytic sites on Pt surfaces, particularly the importance of three-fold Pt sites for certain reactions.
4. The effects of adding a promoter like Sn to Pt catalysts, including electronic and geometric effects.
5. The mechanisms of acetylene transformation on Pt and Pt-Sn alloy surfaces.

However, it does not provide information to compare these platinum-based catalysts with metal oxide-based catalysts for the specific application of nonoxidative dehydrogenation of light olefins. Therefore, a comprehensive comparison of compositions, effectiveness, industrial applications, recent developments, and potential advantages between these two types of catalysts cannot be made based on the given information.

文献提供了关于铂基催化剂的详细信息，包括：

1. 铂基催化剂在各种工业应用中用于烃类转化。
2. 乙炔氢化作为一种重要的工业反应。
3. 铂表面催化位点的几何要求，特别是三重铂位点对某些反应的重要性。
4. 向铂催化剂中添加促进剂（如锡）的影响，包括电子和几何效应。
5. 乙炔在铂和铂-锡合金表面上的转化机制。

然而，它没有提供信息来比较这些铂基催化剂与金属氧化物基催化剂在轻烯烃非氧化脱氢这一特定应用中的情况。因此，基于给定的信息，无法对这两类催化剂的成分、有效性、工业应用、最新发展和潜在优势进行全面比较。
