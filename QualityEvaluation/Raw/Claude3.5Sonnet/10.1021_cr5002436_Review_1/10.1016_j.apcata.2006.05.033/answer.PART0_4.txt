The given literature does not contain any relevant information to answer the question about comparing and contrasting noble metal-based catalysts and metal oxide-based catalysts for nonoxidative dehydrogenation of light olefins. The document appears to be an erratum (correction) for a previously published article, focusing mainly on corrections to typographical errors and a table of data. It does not provide substantial information about different types of catalysts, their compositions, effectiveness, industrial applications, or recent developments in the field of light olefin dehydrogenation.
