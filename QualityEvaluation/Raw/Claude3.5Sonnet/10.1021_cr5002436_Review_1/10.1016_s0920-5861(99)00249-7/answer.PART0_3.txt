The given literature does not contain information to directly compare and contrast noble metal-based catalysts (particularly Platinum) with metal oxide-based catalysts for light olefin dehydrogenation. The document focuses primarily on Platinum-based catalysts, especially Pt/Sn catalysts supported on silica and zeolites, for isobutane dehydrogenation. It does not discuss metal oxide catalysts such as CrOx, gallium, indium, vanadium, zinc, or molybdenum oxides.

The literature provides detailed information on Pt-based catalysts, including:

1. Composition: Pt/Sn catalysts supported on silica and K-L-zeolite, with variations including the addition of potassium.

2. Effectiveness: These catalysts show high selectivity and activity for isobutane dehydrogenation, with Pt/Sn/K-L-zeolite catalysts exhibiting particularly good performance.

3. Recent developments: The research explores the effects of tin and potassium addition, as well as the use of zeolite supports to enhance catalyst performance.

4. Advantages: Pt/Sn catalysts, especially when supported on K-L-zeolite, show high selectivity, good activity, and improved resistance to deactivation compared to pure Pt catalysts.

However, the document does not provide information to compare these catalysts with metal oxide-based systems or discuss their relative industrial applications. Therefore, a comprehensive comparison between noble metal-based and metal oxide-based catalysts for light olefin dehydrogenation cannot be made based solely on the given literature.

给定的文献没有直接比较和对比贵金属基催化剂(特别是铂)与金属氧化物基催化剂在轻质烯烃脱氢方面的信息。该文档主要关注铂基催化剂，特别是负载在二氧化硅和沸石上的Pt/Sn催化剂，用于异丁烷脱氢。它没有讨论诸如CrOx、镓、铟、钒、锌或钼氧化物等金属氧化物催化剂。

文献提供了关于铂基催化剂的详细信息，包括：

1. 组成：负载在二氧化硅和K-L-沸石上的Pt/Sn催化剂，变体包括添加钾。

2. 有效性：这些催化剂在异丁烷脱氢方面表现出高选择性和活性，其中Pt/Sn/K-L-沸石催化剂表现特别好。

3. 最新发展：研究探讨了添加锡和钾的影响，以及使用沸石载体来提高催化剂性能。

4. 优势：Pt/Sn催化剂，特别是当负载在K-L-沸石上时，与纯Pt催化剂相比，表现出高选择性、良好的活性和更好的抗失活能力。

然而，该文档没有提供将这些催化剂与金属氧化物基系统进行比较的信息，也没有讨论它们的相对工业应用。因此，仅基于给定的文献，无法对贵金属基和金属氧化物基催化剂在轻质烯烃脱氢方面进行全面的比较。
