Abstract
Catalytic dehydrogenation of isobutane is important because of growing demand for isobutene as a precursor for the
production of oxygenates required in reformulated gasoline. It was found that supporting tin and platinum in K-L-zeolite
produces catalysts that exhibit high activity and selectivity for isobutane dehydrogenation. Furthermore, Pt/Sn/K-L-zeolite
catalysts exhibit high resistance to deactivation at conditions conducive to high dehydrogenation conversions. Fundamental
investigations of silica-supported Pt/Sn catalysts show that tin interacts with platinum to form Pt/Sn alloy particles, which
reduces the size of surface Pt ensembles and inhibits the formation of highly dehydrogenated surface species required for the
competing isomerization, hydrogenolysis, and coking reactions. Similarly, the addition of potassium to Pt/Sn/SiO2 increases
the selectivity for isobutane dehydrogenation by further reducing the size of surface Pt ensembles. 2000 Elsevier Science

1. Introduction
Platinum-based materials are employed exten-
sively as catalysts for the reforming of hydrocarbon
streams in the production of petrochemicals and
gasoline [1,2]. It has been shown that modifications
of platinum-based materials result in catalysts that
exhibit high selectivity for the dehydrogenation of
isobutane to isobutene at elevated temperatures (e.g.
[310]). Catalytic dehydrogenation of isobutane is im-
portant because of the growing demand for isobutene
as a precursor for the production of oxygenates re-
quired in reformulated gasoline [10].
Recently, it was shown that supporting tin and
platinum in the potassium form of L-zeolite pro-
duces a unique material that exhibits high activity
and selectivity for isobutane dehydrogenation to
isobutene [7,9,11,12]. The favorable properties of this

material are caused by a unique combination of
metal, modifiers, and support. The importance of
these different components on the reactivity of isobu-
tane has been elucidated in various studies of silica-
and L-zeolite-supported Pt/Sn catalysts [69,11,13].
This present paper discusses the results from diverse
experimental techniques employed in our studies of
different Pt/Sn-based materials (e.g. steady-state ki-
netics, isotopic tracing kinetics, microcalorimetry,
Mssbauer spectroscopy, temperature programmed
oxidation, and transmission electron microscopy).
Furthermore, these results are combined to develop
a quantitative understanding of how the different
components of Pt/Sn/K-L-zeolite allow this sys-
tem to be highly selective and stable for isobutane
dehydrogenation.

mine the selectivities for the reactions of isobutane

over a variety of silica- and L-zeolite supported
Pt/Sn catalysts. These Pt/Sn catalysts were character-
ized using tin Mssbauer spectroscopy to determine
the extent of interaction of tin with the platinum
and the support. Transmission electron microscopy
(TEM) investigations were conducted to determine
the size and location of metal particles on the cat-
alytic supports. Microcalorimetric investigations of
the adsorption of hydrogen, ethylene, and isobutene
were performed to determine the number of surface
sites and the interaction strengths of these probe
molecules with the surface sites. Detailed kinetic
studies and deuterium tracing investigations were
performed to elucidate the kinetically significant
steps and to develop a quantitative description of the
catalytic chemistry. Finally, deactivation kinetic stud-
ies were combined with temperature programmed
oxidation investigations to elucidate possible deac-
tivation mechanisms. Based on the results of the
deactivation studies, kinetic studies were conducted
at lower temperatures in the absence of feed hydro-
gen to demonstrate that Pt/Sn/K-L-zeolite can be
used under conditions where catalyst deactivation
is minimal (i.e. rates of metal sintering and carbon
deposition are slow).
2.1. Catalyst preparation
Silica-supported Pt/Sn catalysts were prepared by
sequential impregnation [6,8]. Platinum was added to
Cab-O-Sil (Cabot) by ion-exchange using the method
of Benesi et al. [14]. Tin was added to the Pt/SiO2 cat-
alyst by evaporative impregnation of a solution of trib-
utyltin acetate in pentane. After impregnation with tin,
the catalysts were dried at 390 K, treated with flowing
oxygen at 573 K, followed by reduction in flowing
hydrogen at 773 K. Silica-supported Pt/Sn/K cata-
lysts were prepared by impregnating the Pt/Sn/SiO2
catalysts with a KOH aqueous solution using the
incipient wetting technique [8]. Pt/Sn/K-L-zeolite
catalysts were prepared by the sequential impregna-
tion of tin and platinum [7,9]. Tosoh L-zeolite with a
silica to alumina ratio of 6.2 and a potassium content
of 13.6 wt.% was used as the support. After calcining
the support, an incipient wetness impregnation with a
solution of tributyltin acetate in methanol was done
in a dry nitrogen atmosphere. This procedure was
followed by drying in air and calcining at 573 K
before impregnation with an aqueous solution of plat-
inum tetraammine nitrate. The catalysts were then
dried at 573 K and reduced at 773 or 873 K for 6 h.
Catalysts were sent for elemental analyses (Galbraith
Laboratories) to determine the loadings of platinum,
tin, and potassium. Additionally, the number of sur-
face platinum sites were determined by hydrogen
chemisorption at 403 K or by CO chemisorption at
298 K.
Catalysts are named according to the atomic ratios
of Pt, Sn and K (i.e. a 1 : 1 : 2.5 Pt/Sn/K/SiO2 cata-
lyst has atomic ratios of Pt : Sn : K of 1 : 1 : 2.5 and a
1 : 2.5 Pt/Sn/L catalyst has an atomic ratio of Pt : Sn of
1 : 2.5). All of the catalysts used in these studies had
between 0.5 and 2.5 wt.% Pt.
2.2. Reaction kinetic studies
Reaction kinetic studies of isobutane conversion
were conducted using a stainless-steel apparatus and
a quartz, down-flow reactor. Helium (liquid carbonic)
was employed as a carrier gas, and it was purified by
passage through copper turnings at 473 K, followed
by activated molecular sieves (13X) at 77 K. Isobutane
(liquid carbonic, 99.5%) was treated by passage over
beds of reduced Oxytrap (Alltech) and reduced Ni on
alumina at 373 K to remove oxygen and sulfur im-
purities, respectively. Hydrogen (liquid carbonic) was
treated by passage through a Deoxo unit (Engelhard)
and a bed of molecular sieves (13X) at 77 K. The reac-
tor inlet and outlet gases were analyzed by an HP-5890
gas-chromatograph with FID detector and a 10 foot
15% Squalane Chromsorb PAW column at 323 K.
Initial isobutane reactivities were measured over
the various catalysts at 673 K, 0.016 atm of isobu-
tane, 0.098 atm of hydrogen and a total pressure of
1 atm. The catalysts were first reduced with hydrogen
at 773 K for 1 h and then cooled to 673 K before ki-
netic data were collected. The results of these mea-
surements are summarized in Table 1. The turnover
frequencies are based on the number of surface plat-
inum atoms determined from saturation hydrogen up-
takes at 403 K, as reported in Table 1.
Table 1 shows that the addition of Sn to Pt/SiO2
suppresses the hydrogenolysis and isomerization re-
actions, and the turnover frequencies for the produc-

tion of methane, ethane, propane, and n-butane de-
crease with increasing tin content (e.g., the propane
production turnover frequency decreases from 0.026
to 0.00045 s1 as the Pt/Sn ratio changes from 1 : 0
to 1 : 3). The suppression of isomerization and hy-
drogenolysis reactions over the Pt/Sn catalysts leads
to an enhancement in the selectivity for production
of isobutene, and the overall isobutane conversion is
limited to the dehydrogenation equilibrium conversion
to isobutene (ca., 7% for the reaction conditions) [6].
Table 1 shows that the addition of potassium to 1 : 1
Pt/Sn/SiO2 catalyst further decreases the rates for pro-
duction of methane, ethane, propane, and n-butane.
The further suppression of the isomerization and hy-
drogenolysis reaction upon addition of potassium re-
sults in a higher isobutane dehydrogenation selectivity
[8].
It can be seen in Table 1 that a Pt/L-zeolite cata-
lyst exhibits significantly higher activity for isobutane
conversion compared to the Pt/SiO2 catalyst. Specif-
ically, the Pt/L-zeolite catalyst exhibits turnover fre-
quencies for conversion of isobutane and for produc-
tion of methane, ethane, propane, and n-butane that are
an order of magnitude higher than the Pt/SiO2 catalyst.
The addition of tin to L-zeolite-supported platinum
significantly lowers turnover frequencies for the con-
version of isobutane and for production of methane,
ethane, propane, and n-butane, as shown in Table 1.
Similar to the silica-supported system, the hydrogenol-
ysis and isomerization reaction rates decrease with in-
creasing tin content of the Pt/Sn/K-L-zeolite catalysts,
and the isobutane conversion is limited over these
Pt/Sn/K-L-zeolite catalysts by the equilibrium conver-
sion of isobutane to isobutene [7].
2.3. Mssbauer spectroscopy
Room temperature Mssbauer spectra of
119Sn
were collected using an Austin Science Associates
Model S-600 Mssbauer spectrometer, connected
to a microcomputer with a PCAII data collection
board [6,7]. The spectrometer was operated in the
constant-acceleration mode, with a 10 mCi single-line
g-ray source of Ca119mSnO3 (Amarsham). Chemi-
cal shifts are reported relative to BaSnO3 at room
temperature.
Fig. 1a shows the room temperature Mssbauer
spectrum for the 1 : 1 Pt/Sn/SiO2 catalyst after treat-
ment with flowing hydrogen at 773 K. This spectrum
consists of a single dominant peak at a chemical shift
of 1.83 mm/s [6]. This spectrum shows no evidence
for SnO2 species and slight evidence for SnO. Based
on Mssbauer spectroscopy data for Pt/Sn alloys and
solutions reported by Gray and Farha [15], the chem-
ical shift of this single peak indicates that the tin is
zero valent and is alloyed with platinum. The chem-
ical shift for the Pt/Sn alloy peak shown in Fig. 1a
indicates an alloy with a tin content of 48 atom %
Sn, which is in agreement with the elemental analysis
data.
Fig. 1b shows the Mssbauer spectrum collected for
the 1 : 3.5 Pt/Sn/K-L-zeolite catalyst after treatment in
H2 at 773 K for 8 h. This spectrum exhibits a singlet

peak attributed to formation of Pt/Sn alloy particles,
but it also shows a predominant doublet attributed to
Sn2+. Reduction of the 1 : 3.5 Pt/Sn/K-L-zeolite cata-
lyst at a higher temperature (873 K for 10 h) appears
to further reduce the tin, as shown in Fig. 1c. The
Mssbauer spectrum in this figure shows a decrease
in the relative intensity of the doublet compared to
the singlet with increased temperature. Accordingly,
the higher temperature reduction appears to reduce
the Sn2+ species to a zero-valent tin species which is
mostly likely alloyed with platinum.
2.4. Electron microscopy
Transmission electron microscopic studies were
conducted using a high resolution microscope (Phillips
CM 200 equipped with a LaB6 filament) at a point
resolution of 0.2 nm and a magnification range of
25× to 1.6 M×. A spot size of 120 nm was used to
minimize electron beam damage to the specimens.
Fresh catalysts were analyzed to determine if the
Pt and Sn were located within the pores of the zeo-
lite. Fig. 2a is a typical micrograph of a fresh catalyst.
Lattice fringes from the L-zeolite are visible but few
if any particles are visible on the external surface of
the zeolite. After extended periods of exposure to high
temperature, however, particles appear on the catalyst
surface. Fig. 2b shows the presence of a few 5 nm par-
ticles as well as several 12 nm particles. This micro-
graph is of a 1 : 2.5 Pt/Sn/K-L-zeolite catalyst which
had been exposed to reaction conditions of 0.67 atm
hydrogen and 0.33 atm isobutane for 4 h at 873 K. For
this sample, 12 nm particles were visible on the ma-
jority of the external surface of the zeolite. As the cat-
alysts are held at high temperature for longer times,
the size and number of particles generally increase. On
Pt/K-L-zeolite catalysts, however, the particle sizes do
not increase to the same extent as on a Sn-modified
catalyst, i.e. only 12 nm sized particles are visible on
a Pt/K-L-zeolite catalyst after 4 h reaction at 873 K
with 0.67 atm hydrogen and 0.33 atm isobutane [12].
Mssbauer spectroscopy has shown that Pt and Sn
form alloy clusters in L-zeolite, but the majority of the
Sn is present as Sn2+ [7]. Studies on Pt/Sn/alumina
[16,17] and Pt/Sn/NaY-zeolite [18] have shown that
the proportion of tin in metallic particles increased
with metal particle size. Furthermore, Merlen et
al. [16] have suggested that metallic tin cannot be
stabilized in small particles. Thus, the Sn2+ in the
Pt/Sn/K-L-zeolite catalyst may slowly become re-
duced in the presence of hydrogen during isobutane
dehydrogenation at 873 K and migrate to the Pt/Sn
alloy particles, resulting in surface enrichment with
metallic Sn, particle agglomeration, and the loss of
accessible Pt sites.
The sintering of the catalyst can be reduced signifi-
cantly by changing the reaction conditions. TEM anal-
yses of catalysts before and after reaction in isobutane
(in the absence of hydrogen) at 798 K indicate that lit-
tle, if any, particle agglomeration occurs after 4 h of
reaction [12].
2.5. Microcalorimetry
Differential enthalpy changes of hydrogen, ethy-
lene, and isobutene adsorption were measured over
various Pt/Sn based materials using heat flux mi-
crocalorimetry at several temperatures [68,1921].
Fig. 3 shows the differential heats of adsorptions
for ethylene and isobutene over a 2.5 wt.% Pt/SiO2
catalyst and a 2 : 1 Pt/Sn/SiO2 (2.5 wt.% Pt) catalyst
at 303 K [19]. Values of the differential enthalpy

changes of adsorption, 1Hads, are negative, and it is
convenient to define the heat of adsorption as being
equal to 1Hads.
This figure shows that the addition of tin to
silica-supported platinum reduces the initial heat of
ethylene adsorption. Similar effects of adding tin
to supported platinum on the heats of ethylene ad-
sorption have been observed in related investigations
[6,8,20]. Spectroscopic investigations suggest that
ethylene dissociatively adsorbs on platinum surfaces

at room temperature to form ethylidyne species and
adsorbed atomic hydrogen, but the addition of tin
suppresses the formation of ethylidyne species such
that molecularly-adsorbed ethylene is also present
at room temperature on tin-modified platinum sur-
faces [20,22,23]. Accordingly, the combined results
of spectroscopic and microcalorimetric investigations
suggest that the higher initial heat (ca. 150 kJ/mol)
for ethylene adsorption on platinum surfaces at room
temperature may be attributed to the dissociation of
ethylene to form ethylidyne species and adsorbed hy-
drogen [6,1921]. Furthermore, the combined results
of these techniques suggest that the addition of tin
suppresses the decomposition of ethylene, and the ob-
served lower initial heat of adsorption (ca. 115 kJ/mol)
may be in part attributed to the formation of only
molecularly-adsorbed ethylene [6,19,20]. It appears
that the decomposition of ethylene to form ethyli-
dyne requires larger platinum ensembles compared to
molecularly-adsorbed ethylene.
In a recent study [20], the combined results of
microcalorimetric and infrared spectroscopic exper-
iments indicate that Sn suppresses the formation
of ethylidyne and also weakens the interaction of
molecularly-adsorbed ethylene with the catalyst. Re-
sults from density functional theory calculations on
Pt/Sn clusters suggest that besides geometric block-
ing effects, there is also an electron charge transfer
from tin to platinum. Accordingly, the addition of
tin to platinum reduces the effective size of surface
platinum ensemble through either geometric and/or
electronic effects and suppresses the formation of
more-highly dehydrogenated surface species.
Fig. 3 shows that the addition of tin to Pt/SiO2 de-
creases the initial heat of isobutene adsorption from
185 kJ/mol on Pt/SiO2 to 125 kJ/mol on Pt/Sn/SiO2.
Similar to the adsorption of ethylene, the higher heat
for isobutene adsorption on Pt/SiO2 can be attributed
to the decomposition of isobutene to an isobutyli-
dyne species and surface hydrogen atoms. The lower
heat of adsorption on Pt/Sn/SiO2 may be attributed
to molecularly adsorbed olefin. Accordingly, the ad-
dition of tin to supported platinum appears to sup-
press the decomposition of adsorbed olefins to more
highly-dehydrogenated species.
2.6. Hydrogenation/dehydrogenation kinetics
Kinetic studies were conducted to determine re-
action rates and kinetic orders for isobutane de-
hydrogenation and isobutene hydrogenation over
1 : 1 Pt/Sn/SiO2, 1 : 1 : 2.5 Pt/Sn/K/SiO2, and 1 : 2.5
Pt/Sn/K-L-zeolite catalysts at 673, 723, and 773 K
[11,13]. All data were collected at a total flow rate
of 304 cm3(STP)/min and the catalyst amounts were
adjusted to maintain conversions less than 15% of the
equilibrium values. At these low conversions, the cat-
alysts exhibited dehydrogenation selectivities greater
than 98%. Turnover frequencies were calculated from
the kinetic data based on the number of surface plat-
inum atoms determined by the saturation uptakes of
hydrogen at 403 K (22  1, 38  1, and 4.0  0.5 mmol
surface Pt/g for the Pt/Sn/SiO2, Pt/Sn/K/SiO2, and
Pt/Sn/K-L-zeolite catalysts, respectively).
Fig. 4a shows the effect of temperature on the rates
of isobutane dehydrogenation at 0.016 atm isobutane
and 0.098 atm hydrogen over the three investigated
catalysts. This figure shows that the addition of potas-
sium to Pt/Sn/SiO2 nearly doubles the dehydrogena-
tion rate, and the dehydrogenation rates are more than
an order of magnitude higher over Pt/Sn/K-L-zeolite
compared to Pt/Sn/SiO2 or Pt/Sn/K/SiO2. Fig. 4b
shows the effect of temperature on the rates of
isobutene hydrogenation at 0.013 atm isobutene and
0.13 atm hydrogen partial pressures over the three
catalysts. As with the dehydrogenation reaction, the
addition of potassium to Pt/Sn/SiO2 significantly
increases the hydrogenation rate, and the hydrogena-

tion reaction rates are over an order of magnitude
higher more than Pt/Sn/K-L-zeolite compared to the
silica-supported catalysts.
The average hydrogenation/dehydrogenation reac-
tions rates were 2.5 times faster over Pt/Sn/K/SiO2
and 50 times faster over Pt/Sn/K-L-zeolite compared
to Pt/Sn/SiO2 [11] when the turnover frequencies
are based on the number of surface platinum atoms.
If the turnover frequencies are based on the total
number of platinum atoms present on these catalysts,
then the factor for Pt/Sn/K/SiO2 would increase from
2.5 to 4.3, and the factor would decrease from 50 to
24 for Pt/Sn/K-L-zeolite. Importantly, these turnover
frequencies are still considerably higher over the
Pt/Sn/K-L-zeolite catalyst when the rates are based
on total platinum.
2.7. Deuterium tracing studies
Deuterium tracing studies were conducted to de-
termine the extent of deuterium incorporation into
isobutane and isobutene during the isobutane dehy-
drogenation and isobutene hydrogenation reactions
[13]. The reactor effluent was analyzed with a gas
chromatograph (PerkinElmer Sigma 3B with a ther-
moconductivity detector), and the separated gases
from the GC were directed to a mass spectrometer
(EAI Quad 250B) for analysis. Mass spectroscopic
measurements were conducted on the separated isobu-
tane and isobutene fractions in the reactor effluent
over the mass range of the parent peaks (5468 amu
for isobutene and 5470 amu for isobutane). Results
of deuterium tracing studies for isobutane dehydro-
genation over both Pt/Sn/SiO2 and Pt/Sn/K/SiO2
show that perdeuterated isobutene is the predominate
product species and the average number of deuterium
atoms incorporated into the isobutene is greater than
6 over both catalysts. Additionally, little deuterium is
incorporated into isobutane, as the average number of
deuterium atoms incorporated into isobutane was 1.4
and 1.9 for Pt/Sn/SiO2 and Pt/Sn/K/SiO2, respectively
[13].
2.8. Kinetic analyses of isobutane dehydrogenation
and isobutene hydrogenation
The combined results from hydrogenation/dehydro-
genation kinetics studies, microcalorimetric measure-
ments of hydrogen and isobutene adsorption, and
deuterium tracing during isobutane dehydrogenation
and isobutene hydrogenation can be explained by a
HoriutiPolanyi mechanism shown below [11,13]:
C4H10 + 2C4H9+ H
(Step 1)
C4H9+ 2C4H8+ H
(Step 2)
C4H8C4H8 + 2
(Step 3)
H2 + 22H
(Step 4)
Based on the deuterium tracing results, it appears
that the dissociative adsorption of isobutane is the
slow step in this process [13]. Therefore, we may
assume that Steps 2, 3, and 4 are quasi-equilibrated
for the experimental conditions of the present study,
leading to the following rate expression for the
hydrogenation-dehydrogenation reactions:
rDH = k1θ2

Pi-C4H10 Pi-C4H8PH2
Keq
(1)
220
R.D. Cortright et al. / Catalysis Today 55 (2000) 213223
where rDH is the net dehydrogenation rate, k1 is
the rate constant for the dissociative adsorption of
isobutane, Keq is the overall equilibrium constant for
isobutane dehydrogenation, and θis the fraction of
sites that is free of adsorbed species. The latter term,
θ, is dependent on the quasi-equilibrated adsorp-
tion/desorption for hydrogen and isobutene [11,13].
Accordingly, the dehydrogenation/hydrogenation re-
actions are dependent on the values of forward rate
constant of Step 1 (k1) and the equilibrium constants
for Steps 3 and 4. The equilibrium constants may be
described in terms of standard entropy changes (1S3
and 1S4) and enthalpy changes (1H3 and 1H4)
for the adsorption of isobutene and hydrogen. These
standard entropy changes can be expressed in terms
of known gaseous entropies and entropies of the sur-
face species  adsorbed H atoms, adsorbed isobutene,
and the activated complex for Step 1. The number of
adjustable parameters is reduced to four by fixing the
heats of isobutene and hydrogen adsorption (1H3 and
1H4) using the results of microcalorimetric experi-
ments [13,19]. The entropies for adsorbed isobutene
and hydrogen were determined from analysis of the
kinetic data from the studies of isobutane dehydro-
genation and isobutene hydrogenations. Results from
this analysis suggest that on all the catalysts the ad-
sorbed isobutene is immobile and adsorbed atomic
hydrogen has one degree of translational freedom
[11].
Furthermore, results from analyses of the kinetic
data show that the free energy change to form the
activation complex for Step 1 at 723 K decreases in
the following order:
Pt/Sn/SiO2 > Pt/Sn/K/SiO2 > Pt/Sn/K-L-zeolite
(167 kJ/mol)
(160 kJ/mol)
(136 kJ/mol)
This trend suggests that the activated complex
of Step 1 is stabilized over Pt/Sn/K/SiO2
and
Pt/Sn/K-L-zeolite, compared to Pt/Sn/SiO2. There-
fore, the higher reactions rates over Pt/Sn/K-L-zeolite
and Pt/Sn/K/SiO2 may be attributed to stabilization
of the transition-state for the dissociative adsorption
of isobutane by the presence of potassium as well as
by the zeolite micropores [9,13].

2.9. High conversion kinetics data at 873 K
High conversion kinetic data was obtained at
873 K, 0.33 atm isobutane pressure, 0.67 atm hydro-
gen pressure, and a WHSV of 13.2 h1 over a 1 : 2
Pt/Sn/K-L-zeolite catalyst. At these reaction condi-
tions the equilibrium conversion to isobutene is 58%.
These kinetic studies were performed with 2035
mesh catalyst particles packed between quartz glass
plugs in a narrow quartz U-tube reactor. This reac-
tor configuration eliminated gas-phase reactions as
confirmed via kinetic testing of an empty reactor.
The catalyst was pretreated at 873 K for 1 h in pure
H2. Fig. 5 shows that the Pt/Sn/K-L-zeolite catalyst
exhibits an initial isobutane dehydrogenation selec-
tivity of 92% at an isobutane conversion of 61%. This
kinetic study was run for 126 h in view of the slow
deactivation. After 126 h, the isobutane conversion
decreased to 46% and the dehydrogenation selectivity
had increased to 99.8%.
2.10. Deactivation investigations
As Fig. 5 shows, the Pt/Sn/K-L-zeolite catalyst de-
activates in the presence of hydrogen at 873 K. There-
fore, TEM analysis (discussed above), and tempera-
ture programmed oxidation (TPO) studies were per-
formed to determine the origin of deactivation [12].
In the TPO studies, the investigated catalysts were
first exposed to reaction conditions (873 K, 0.33 atm
isobutane and 0.67 atm hydrogen) for 4 h, cooled to

298 K in helium, and then heated from 298 to 873 K
at 10 K/min in a flowing mixture of 2% oxygen in he-
lium. The exit gas from the reactor was analyzed for
H2O, CO and CO2 using a mass spectrometer (EAI
Quad 250B residual gas analyzer). Calibration of the
mass 44 signal was achieved using a gas mixture of
5% carbon dioxide in helium (AGA).
Fig. 6 shows that the addition of tin to L-zeolite-
supported platinum decreases the amount of de-
posited carbon. This shows that the evolution of CO2
is significantly decreased with the addition of tin.
Furthermore, the peak for the 1 : 2.5 Pt/Sn/K-L-zeolite
catalyst is shifted to higher temperature compared
to the Pt/K-L-zeolite catalyst. Similar results were
observed when tin was added to silica-supported
platinum [12]. It has been shown that the lower tem-
perature peaks in TPO spectra generally correspond
to carbon on Pt, while the higher temperature peaks
correspond to carbon on the support [2428]. Thus,
the observed temperature shift suggests that the small
amount of deposited carbon on the Pt/Sn/K-L-zeolite
catalyst may be associated with the support. Lin
et al. [26] reported a similar effect when tin was added
to alumina-supported platinum. These investigators
observed that Sn decreased the ratio of the carbon
deposited on the metal to the total carbon deposited
[26]. It has been suggested that Sn transports coke
from the active sites to the support on Pt/Sn/alumina
catalysts [26,29,30]. Lieske et al. [30] proposed a
drain-off mechanism to explain the stabilizing effect
of Sn on Pt/alumina catalysts. As suggested above,
the presence of Sn decreases the size of the surface
Pt ensembles so that the hydrocarbon cannot readily

form multiple carbon-metal bonds. Because the ad-
sorbed species is attached less strongly to the metal
surface, it may be more mobile and it may more
easily migrate to the support.
The combined results of Mssbauer spectroscopic,
TEM, and kinetic investigations show that extended
reduction of Pt/Sn/K-L-zeolite at 873 K has detri-
mental effects on the catalytic performance of this
material. Mssbauer spectroscopic results show that
extended reduction at 873 K leads to enhanced Pt/Sn
alloy formation (see Fig. 1) and TEM indicates that
significant particle growth occurs on catalysts re-
duced for 16 h at 873 K [12]. In conjunction with the
spectroscopic results, Fig. 7 shows a significant de-
crease in the isobutane dehydrogenation reaction rate
with increased reduction time at 873 K. The isobu-
tane dehydrogenation reaction rates were determined
at 873 K, 0.33 atm isobutane pressure, and 0.67 atm
hydrogen pressure over a 1 : 2.5 Pt/Sn/K-L-zeolite
catalyst after 1 and 16 h pretreatments in flowing hy-
drogen at 873 K. The lower initial rate of isobutane
dehydrogenation after a 16 h pretreatment is signif-
icantly lower than after a 1 h pretreatment and, in
fact, the rate is similar to the dehydrogenation rate of
the catalyst pretreated for 1 h followed by 16 h under
reaction conditions. These results suggest that under
reducing conditions, reduction of oxidized tin and/or
an increase in the metal-alloy particle size with time
at 873 K is a significant factor in the deactivation of
the catalyst.
Since TPO investigations show that the addition
of tin and potassium to supported platinum signif-
icantly decreases the amount of deposited carbon
222

[12], the presence of hydrogen may not be critical for
inhibiting deactivation attributed to coking. In fact,
results from kinetic investigations conducted without
hydrogen in the feed show that Pt/Sn/K-L-zeolite
catalysts exhibit high activity, selectivity, and stabil-
ity for isobutane dehydrogenation [7,12]. At 773 K,
a 1 : 3.5 Pt/Sn/K-L-zeolite catalyst maintained isobu-
tane dehydrogenation activity over 45 h on stream
with no hydrogen in the feed [7]. Furthermore, this
investigation showed that the addition of excess
potassium to Pt/Sn/K-L-zeolite further enhanced the
stability of the catalyst in the absence of hydrogen.
At 798 K, kinetic studies show that Pt/K-L-zeolite
deactivates rapidly in the absence of feed hydrogen,
whereas a 1 : 2.5 Pt/Sn/K-L-zeolite maintains signifi-
cant activity under the same reaction conditions [12].
Furthermore, little or no particle migration occurred
on the Pt/Sn/K-L-zeolite catalyst under reducing con-
ditions at 798 K. Isobutane dehydrogenation over
Pt/Sn/K-L-zeolite catalysts at lower hydrogen partial
pressures and lower temperatures has several advan-
tages including: (1) higher equilibrium conversion for
the dehydrogenation reaction at lower hydrogen par-
tial pressures; (2) decreased reduction of oxidized tin
at lower hydrogen partial pressures and lower tem-
peratures; and (3) decreased particle migration and
growth at lower temperatures.
3. Summary
Results from previous reaction kinetics studies of
isobutane conversion showed that hydrogenolysis and
isomerization reactions are suppressed over small
platinum particles [6]. It is generally accepted that hy-
drogenolysis requires the alkane molecule to undergo
successive dehydrogenation processes prior to the
rate-limiting CC bond breaking step [3133]. In ad-
dition, the bond-shift mechanism for metal-catalyzed
isomerization requires that the alkane molecule un-
dergo successive dehydrogenation processes before
the rate-limiting bond-shift step. For example, Ander-
son and Avery [34] suggested a bond-shift mechanism
involving a aag-tri-adsorbed intermediate bonded to
two adjacent metal atoms. In short, hydrogenolysis
and isomerization reactions require surface ensem-
bles containing at least several Pt atoms, and these
reactions are inhibited over small metal particles
that lack these surface ensembles. Analogous to the
hydrogenolysis reaction, a fairly large ensemble of
surface Pt atoms is required for reactions leading to
coke formation [35]. In contrast, kinetic results sug-
gest that dehydrogenation reactions can proceed on
small ensembles of surface platinum atoms [6,36].
The results of our kinetics studies show that the
addition of tin to Pt/SiO2 suppresses the isomeriza-
tion and hydrogenolysis of isobutane, and enhances
the dehydrogenation selectivity. Mssbauer spectro-
scopic results show that tin interacts with supported
platinum to produce a Pt/Sn alloy. Microcalorimetric
results show that the addition of tin to Pt/SiO2 inhibits
ethylidyne formation from the adsorption of ethylene.
The combined results of these studies suggest that tin
reduces the size of the surface Pt ensembles on Pt/Sn
alloy particles, suppresses the isomerization and hy-
drogenolysis reactions, and enhances the selectivity
for isobutane dehydrogenation to isobutene [6].
Furthermore, it has been shown that the addition
of potassium to Pt/Sn/SiO2 increases the isobutane
dehydrogenation rate, enhances the dehydrogenation
selectivity, and improves the resistance of the catalyst
to deactivation [8]. Results from this investigation sug-
gest that potassium further reduces the size of surface
platinum ensembles on Pt/Sn/SiO2 which further sup-
presses isomerization and hydrogenolysis reactions of
isobutane and enhances the dehydrogenation selec-
tivity. The addition of potassium may also increase
the dehydrogenation reaction rate by stabilizing reac-
tive intermediates on the surface of the Pt/Sn/K/SiO2
catalyst [11].
It has been shown that Pt/Sn/K-L-zeolite catalysts
exhibit high dehydrogenation activity, high dehydro-
genation selectivity, and high resistance to catalyst
deactivation [7,9,1113]. The properties of this highly
selective dehydrogenation catalyst may be attributed
to the stabilization of small Pt/Sn particles in the
L-zeolite pore in the presence of potassium. Results
from deactivation studies show that Pt/Sn/K-L-zeolite
catalysts exhibit tolerance to deposited carbon, and
the predominate modes of deactivation are enrich-
ment of the Pt/Sn alloy particle surface with tin
and/or sintering of the metal particles under reduc-
ing conditions and high temperatures. Accordingly,
Pt/Sn/K-L-zeolite materials are selective and stable
isobutane dehydrogenation catalysts at conditions of

low hydrogen partial pressures and moderate temper-
atures (i.e., <800 K).
