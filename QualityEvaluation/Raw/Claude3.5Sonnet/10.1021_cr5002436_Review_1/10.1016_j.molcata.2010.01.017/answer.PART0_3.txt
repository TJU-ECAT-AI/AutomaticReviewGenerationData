[1] "Pt and Pt-based alloys have long been known as important catalysts in heterogeneous catalysis. Pt-based catalyst can be used in many industry processes, including the hydrogenation of olefins, the dehydrogenation and cracking of paraffins, e.g., the conversion of propane to propylene [59]."

[2] "Currently, commercial process for propylene synthesis through direct dehydrogenation of propane is available. However, this process suffers from several problems such as coke formation and thermodynamic limitations [4]."

The literature primarily focuses on platinum-based catalysts for propane dehydrogenation, and does not provide information on metal oxide-based catalysts. Therefore, a comprehensive comparison between noble metal-based and metal oxide-based catalysts cannot be made based solely on this document.

From the given information, we can conclude that platinum and platinum-based alloys are important catalysts in heterogeneous catalysis, particularly for processes like hydrogenation of olefins and dehydrogenation of paraffins, including the conversion of propane to propylene. 

The document mentions that there are commercial processes for direct dehydrogenation of propane to produce propylene. However, these processes face challenges such as coke formation and thermodynamic limitations.

The literature does not provide specific information on the composition, effectiveness, industrial applications, recent developments, or potential advantages of platinum catalysts compared to metal oxide-based catalysts in the field of light olefin dehydrogenation.

该文献主要关注铂基催化剂在丙烷脱氢中的应用，并未提供关于金属氧化物基催化剂的信息。因此，仅根据这份文档无法全面比较贵金属基和金属氧化物基催化剂。

从给出的信息中，我们可以得出结论：铂和铂基合金是重要的多相催化剂，特别适用于烯烃加氢和烷烃脱氢等过程，包括丙烷转化为丙烯。

文档提到，目前已有商业化的丙烷直接脱氢生产丙烯的工艺。然而，这些工艺面临着诸如积碳和热力学限制等挑战。

该文献未提供铂催化剂与金属氧化物基催化剂在轻质烯烃脱氢领域的具体组成、有效性、工业应用、最新发展或潜在优势的对比信息。
