[1] "Pt and Pt-based alloys have long been known as important catalysts in heterogeneous catalysis. Pt-based catalyst can be used in many industry processes, including the hydrogenation of olefins, the dehydrogenation and cracking of paraffins, e.g., the conversion of propane to propylene [59]."

[2] "Currently, commercial process for propylene synthesis through direct dehydrogenation of propane is available. However, this process suffers from several problems such as coke formation and thermodynamic limitations [4]."

[3] "Compared to the direct dehydrogenation process, the so-called dehydrogenation oxidation (DHO) is preferred because of the introduction of selective oxidation of H2."

The literature provided does not contain sufficient information to fully compare and contrast noble metal-based catalysts (particularly Platinum) with metal oxide-based catalysts for the nonoxidative dehydrogenation of light olefins. The text focuses primarily on Platinum catalysts and does not discuss metal oxide catalysts such as CrOx, gallium, indium, vanadium, zinc, and molybdenum oxides.

From the limited information available, we can say that:

1. Platinum-based catalysts are important in heterogeneous catalysis and are used in various industrial processes, including the dehydrogenation of paraffins like propane to propylene.

2. The direct dehydrogenation process for propylene synthesis from propane (which likely uses Pt-based catalysts) has some drawbacks, including coke formation and thermodynamic limitations.

3. An alternative process called dehydrogenation oxidation (DHO) is preferred over direct dehydrogenation due to the selective oxidation of H2.

The document does not provide information on the composition, effectiveness, industrial applications, recent developments, or potential advantages of metal oxide-based catalysts in comparison to Platinum-based catalysts for light olefin dehydrogenation.

所提供的文献没有足够的信息来全面比较和对比用于轻烯烃非氧化脱氢的贵金属基催化剂（特别是铂）和金属氧化物基催化剂。文本主要关注铂催化剂，没有讨论诸如CrOx、镓、铟、钒、锌和钼氧化物等金属氧化物催化剂。

从有限的可用信息中，我们可以得出以下结论：

1. 铂基催化剂在多相催化中非常重要，并在各种工业过程中使用，包括烷烃（如丙烷到丙烯）的脱氢。

2. 直接脱氢工艺用于从丙烷合成丙烯（可能使用铂基催化剂）存在一些缺点，包括积碳形成和热力学限制。

3. 一种称为脱氢氧化（DHO）的替代工艺因H2的选择性氧化而优于直接脱氢。

该文档没有提供关于金属氧化物基催化剂在轻烯烃脱氢方面与铂基催化剂相比的组成、效率、工业应用、最新发展或潜在优势的信息。
