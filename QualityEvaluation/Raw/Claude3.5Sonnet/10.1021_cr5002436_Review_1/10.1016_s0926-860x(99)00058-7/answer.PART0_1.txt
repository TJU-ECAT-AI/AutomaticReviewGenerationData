[1] "The effect of the addition of different metals (Re, Sn, Ge, Pb, etc.) to Pt/Al2O3 has been extensively studied for the application in the naphtha reforming process and in the dehydrogenation of low and high molecular weight paraffins [16]."

[2] "It is well known that the Ga addition to metallic catalysts supported on zeolite materials increases the yield to aromatics when they are used in paraffins aromatization processes [7]."

[3] "The main positive effect of the Ga addition to Pt/Al2O3 is related to the important increase in the selectivity to propylene, such as Figs. 3 and 4 show."

[4] "When Ga is added to Pt/Al2O3, the initial selectivity to propylene is enhanced and the carbon retention is decreased. This effect can be related to a diminution of the concentration of hydrogenolytic sites due to a modification of the metallic phase by Ga addition."

The literature primarily focuses on platinum-based catalysts, particularly Pt/Al2O3 and PtGa/Al2O3, for the dehydrogenation of light olefins. It does not provide a comprehensive comparison with metal oxide-based catalysts.

Composition: The main catalysts discussed are Pt/Al2O3 and PtGa/Al2O3. The addition of gallium to platinum is a key focus.

Effectiveness: The addition of Ga to Pt/Al2O3 significantly improves the catalyst's performance, particularly in terms of selectivity to propylene and reduced carbon formation.

Industrial applications: These catalysts are used in naphtha reforming and the dehydrogenation of low and high molecular weight paraffins.

Recent developments: The study focuses on the effect of Ga addition to Pt/Al2O3, which is shown to enhance propylene selectivity and reduce catalyst deactivation.

Potential advantages: PtGa/Al2O3 catalysts show improved selectivity to propylene, reduced carbon retention, and decreased concentration of hydrogenolytic sites compared to Pt/Al2O3.

The document does not provide information on CrOx, indium, vanadium, zinc, or molybdenum oxide catalysts for comparison. Therefore, a comprehensive comparison between noble metal-based and metal oxide-based catalysts cannot be made based solely on this literature.
