[1] "The effect of the addition of different metals (Re, Sn, Ge, Pb, etc.) to Pt/Al2O3 has been extensively studied for the application in the naphtha reforming process and in the dehydrogenation of low and high molecular weight parafns [16]."

[2] "It is well known that the Ga addition to metallic catalysts supported on zeolite materials increases the yield to aromatics when they are used in parafns aromatization processes [7]."

[3] "The main positive effect of the Ga addition to Pt/Al2O3 is related to the important increase in the selectivity to propylene, such as Figs. 3 and 4 show."

[4] "When Ga is added to Pt/Al2O3, the initial selectivity to propylene is enhanced and the carbon retention is decreased."

[5] "The surface model postulated for this bimetallic system would involve the presence of two Ga species: one of them would correspond to Ga in an intimate contact with Pt and the another one could be assigned to Ga species localized on the support, which only produces a low modication of the support acidity."

The literature primarily focuses on platinum-based catalysts modified with gallium for propane dehydrogenation, rather than providing a comprehensive comparison with other metal oxide-based catalysts. However, some insights can be drawn:

Composition: The study examines Pt/Al2O3 catalysts modified with varying amounts of Ga. Other noble metal catalysts mentioned include those modified with Re, Sn, Ge, and Pb.

Effectiveness: Ga addition to Pt/Al2O3 significantly improves selectivity to propylene and reduces carbon formation (deactivation). The bimetallic PtGa catalysts show better performance than monometallic Pt catalysts.

Industrial applications: These catalysts are relevant for naphtha reforming and dehydrogenation of low and high molecular weight paraffins. Ga-modified zeolite catalysts are also mentioned for paraffin aromatization processes.

Recent developments: The study investigates the effects of Ga content and reduction temperature on catalyst performance, providing insights into the interaction between Pt and Ga on the catalyst surface.

Potential advantages: PtGa catalysts show improved selectivity, reduced deactivation, and lower carbon formation compared to Pt-only catalysts. The presence of two types of Ga species (in contact with Pt and on the support) contributes to these improvements.

The literature does not provide direct comparisons with CrOx, vanadium, zinc, or molybdenum oxide catalysts for light olefin dehydrogenation. More comprehensive research would be needed to fully address the question regarding other metal oxide-based catalysts.

该文献主要集中在研究添加镓改性的铂基催化剂用于丙烷脱氢,而没有提供与其他金属氧化物基催化剂的全面比较。但是,可以得出一些见解:

组成:研究考察了添加不同含量镓的Pt/Al2O3催化剂。提到的其他贵金属催化剂包括用Re、Sn、Ge和Pb改性的催化剂。

有效性:向Pt/Al2O3添加Ga显著提高了丙烯的选择性并减少了积碳(失活)。双金属PtGa催化剂表现优于单金属Pt催化剂。

工业应用:这些催化剂适用于石脑油重整和低分子量及高分子量烷烃的脱氢。还提到了镓改性的分子筛催化剂用于烷烃芳构化过程。

最新发展:该研究考察了镓含量和还原温度对催化剂性能的影响,提供了有关Pt和Ga在催化剂表面相互作用的见解。

潜在优势:与仅含Pt的催化剂相比,PtGa催化剂表现出更高的选择性、更低的失活率和更少的碳形成。两种类型的Ga物种(与Pt接触和在载体上)的存在有助于这些改进。

该文献没有直接比较CrOx、钒、锌或钼氧化物催化剂在轻烯烃脱氢方面的性能。需要更全面的研究才能充分回答有关其他金属氧化物基催化剂的问题。
