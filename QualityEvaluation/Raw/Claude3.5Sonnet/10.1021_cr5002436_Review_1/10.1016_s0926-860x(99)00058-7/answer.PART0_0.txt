[1] "The effect of the addition of different metals (Re, Sn, Ge, Pb, etc.) to Pt/Al2O3 has been extensively studied for the application in the naphtha reforming process and in the dehydrogenation of low and high molecular weight parafns"

[2] "It is well known that the Ga addition to metallic catalysts supported on zeolite materials increases the yield to aromatics when they are used in parafns aromatization processes"

[3] "The main positive effect of the Ga addition to Pt/Al2O3 is related to the important increase in the selectivity to propylene"

[4] "When Ga is added to Pt/Al2O3, the initial selectivity to propylene is enhanced and the carbon retention is decreased."

[5] "The surface model postulated for this bimetallic system would involve the presence of two Ga species: one of them would correspond to Ga in an intimate contact with Pt and the another one could be assigned to Ga species localized on the support, which only produces a low modication of the support acidity."

The literature mainly focuses on platinum-gallium bimetallic catalysts for propane dehydrogenation, but some comparisons can be made with other catalyst systems:

Composition: The noble metal-based catalysts discussed are primarily platinum supported on alumina (Pt/Al2O3), with gallium added as a promoter. The literature does not provide detailed information on metal oxide-based catalysts.

Effectiveness: The addition of gallium to Pt/Al2O3 significantly improves catalyst performance, particularly in terms of selectivity to propylene and reduced carbon formation. The Ga-promoted catalysts show higher stability and less deactivation compared to monometallic Pt catalysts.

Industrial applications: Pt-based catalysts, including those promoted with Ga, are used in naphtha reforming and dehydrogenation of low and high molecular weight paraffins. The literature mentions their application in propane dehydrogenation specifically.

Recent developments: The study focuses on understanding the role of gallium in modifying the platinum catalyst. It reveals that Ga addition creates two types of species - one in intimate contact with Pt and another on the support. This leads to geometric effects, blocking of certain Pt sites, and minor electronic modifications, all contributing to improved catalyst performance.

Potential advantages: Ga-promoted Pt catalysts show higher selectivity to the desired olefin product (propylene), reduced formation of unwanted by-products, decreased carbon deposition, and improved catalyst stability. These advantages make them promising for industrial dehydrogenation processes.

The literature does not provide direct comparisons with metal oxide-based catalysts like CrOx, vanadium, zinc, or molybdenum oxides in the context of light olefin dehydrogenation. Therefore, a comprehensive comparison between noble metal-based and metal oxide-based catalysts cannot be made based solely on this document.

该文献主要集中讨论了铂-镓双金属催化剂在丙烷脱氢中的应用，但可以与其他催化剂系统进行一些比较：

组成：讨论的贵金属基催化剂主要是氧化铝负载的铂（Pt/Al2O3），并添加镓作为助剂。文献没有提供关于金属氧化物基催化剂的详细信息。

有效性：向Pt/Al2O3中添加镓显著改善了催化剂性能，特别是在丙烯选择性和减少碳沉积方面。含镓的催化剂表现出更高的稳定性和更低的失活率，相比单金属铂催化剂。

工业应用：包括镓促进的铂基催化剂在内，被用于石脑油重整和低分子量及高分子量烷烃的脱氢。文献特别提到了它们在丙烷脱氢中的应用。

最新发展：研究重点是理解镓在改性铂催化剂中的作用。研究揭示镓的添加产生了两种类型的物种 - 一种与铂密切接触，另一种在载体上。这导致了几何效应、某些铂位点的阻塞，以及轻微的电子修饰，所有这些都有助于改善催化剂性能。

潜在优势：镓促进的铂催化剂表现出更高的目标烯烃产物（丙烯）选择性，减少了不需要的副产物形成，降低了碳沉积，并提高了催化剂稳定性。这些优势使它们在工业脱氢过程中具有很大潜力。

文献没有直接比较CrOx、钒、锌或钼氧化物等金属氧化物基催化剂在轻质烯烃脱氢方面的性能。因此，仅基于这份文档无法全面比较贵金属基和金属氧化物基催化剂。
