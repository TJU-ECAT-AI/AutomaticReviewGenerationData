[1] "The effect of the addition of different metals (Re, Sn, Ge, Pb, etc.) to Pt/Al2O3 has been extensively studied for the application in the naphtha reforming process and in the dehydrogenation of low and high molecular weight parafns"

[2] "It is well known that the Ga addition to metallic catalysts supported on zeolite materials increases the yield to aromatics when they are used in parafns aromatization processes"

[3] "Taking into account the previous comments, a study on the effect of Ga addition to Pt/Al2O3 in the propane dehydrogenation reaction is reported in this paper."

[4] "The main positive effect of the Ga addition to Pt/Al2O3 is related to the important increase in the selectivity to propylene"

[5] "When Ga is added to Pt/Al2O3, the initial selectivity to propylene is enhanced and the carbon retention is decreased."

The literature primarily focuses on platinum-based catalysts, particularly Pt/Al2O3, and the effect of adding gallium to these catalysts for propane dehydrogenation. It does not provide a comprehensive comparison between noble metal-based catalysts and metal oxide-based catalysts for light olefin dehydrogenation.

However, based on the information provided:

1. Composition: The study focuses on Pt/Al2O3 catalysts with varying amounts of gallium added.

2. Effectiveness: The addition of gallium to Pt/Al2O3 catalysts improves selectivity to propylene and decreases carbon retention (coke formation).

3. Industrial applications: These catalysts are studied for propane dehydrogenation, which is a process to produce propylene. The paper also mentions applications in naphtha reforming and dehydrogenation of low and high molecular weight paraffins.

4. Recent developments: The study itself represents a recent development in understanding how gallium addition affects the performance of Pt/Al2O3 catalysts in propane dehydrogenation.

5. Potential advantages: Gallium addition to Pt/Al2O3 catalysts increases selectivity to propylene and decreases catalyst deactivation due to reduced carbon formation.

The document does not provide information on CrOx, indium, vanadium, zinc, or molybdenum oxide catalysts for comparison. To fully answer the question, additional literature on these other catalyst types would be needed.

该文献主要关注铂基催化剂，特别是Pt/Al2O3，以及向这些催化剂中添加镓对丙烷脱氢的影响。它并未提供贵金属基催化剂和金属氧化物基催化剂在轻质烯烃脱氢方面的全面比较。

然而，根据所提供的信息：

1. 组成：研究focus在Pt/Al2O3催化剂上，添加不同量的镓。

2. 有效性：向Pt/Al2O3催化剂中添加镓可以提高丙烯的选择性，并降低碳沉积（焦炭形成）。

3. 工业应用：这些催化剂被研究用于丙烷脱氢，这是一种生产丙烯的过程。文章还提到了在石脑油重整和低分子量和高分子量烷烃脱氢中的应用。

4. 最新发展：该研究本身代表了理解镓添加如何影响Pt/Al2O3催化剂在丙烷脱氢中性能的最新进展。

5. 潜在优势：向Pt/Al2O3催化剂中添加镓可以提高丙烯的选择性，并由于碳形成减少而降低催化剂失活。

该文档没有提供关于CrOx、铟、钒、锌或钼氧化物催化剂的信息以供比较。要全面回答这个问题，需要额外关于这些其他类型催化剂的文献。
