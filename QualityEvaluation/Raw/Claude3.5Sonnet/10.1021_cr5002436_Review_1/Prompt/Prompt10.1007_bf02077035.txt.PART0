With increasing amounts of Pb or Sn the weak adsorption of hydrogen decreases, the 
adsorption of oxygen increases and the activity in the dehydrogenation of cyclohexane 
decreases. A correlation could be found between the amount of weakly adsorbed 
hydrogen and the dehydrogenation activity.

INTRODUCTION 
Bimetallic Pt-Sn and Pt-Pb catalysts often axe proposed for an improvement of 
the monometallic Pt/AI2Oa reforming catalyst. In one reaction of this process, the 
dehydrogenation of cyclohexane, the addition of Sn poisons the Pt/1/. The mechan- 
ism of this poisoning is still unclear. For the determination of the Pt dispersity in 
Pt-Sn catalysts the adsorption of hydrogen and oxygen has been proposed /2/. 
However, it seems questionable, whether the variation of chemisorption is due only 
to a variation of the Pt dispersity or to a chemical modification of the Pt by Sn. 
Therefore, we have studied in detail the influence of Sn and Pb on the dehydro- 
genation and the adsorption properties of Pt. 
EXPERIMENTAL 
The catalysts were prepared by impregnation of r/-A1203 with acidic solutions 
of H2ptcI6, and SnCI: or PbNOa. They were dried at 393K calcined in air at 
773 K and reduced in a hydrogen flow for 1 h at 773 K. The catalytic measure-

Fig. l. Adsorption of hydrogen and oxygen as a function of thebimetal content 
ments were performed in an integral reactor with a flow of 2.26 1 H/h, saturated 
with 60 Torr cyclohexane. The amount of catalyst (0.3-0.8 mm diameter) was 
0.1 g with a constant Pt content of 0.5 wt.%, diluted with 0.3 g a-A12Oa. 
H2 and 02 chemisorption on the catalysts was measured by a pulse technique 
with catharometric indication. Before pulsing, the samples calcined and reduced in 
situ were fmaUy treated for 1 h in flowing argon at773 K in order to desorb the 
hydrogen adsorbed during reduction. 
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 
1. Chemisorption 
Hydrogen chemisorption has been studied at 273 K and at 573 K, oxygen chemi- 
sorption at 273 K. The results, calculated in atomic rations H/Pt and O/Pt respec- 
tively, are shown in Fig. 1. With increasing content of the second metal, the amount 
of hydrogens adsorbed at low temperature (nH2) decreases strongly and the amount 
adsorbed at high temperature (nH573) increases slightly. Only catalysts with nI47 
 > nr  
are active in dehydrogenation and therefore only those will be discussed. The decreas- 
88 
VOLTER et al.: DEHYDROGENATION OF CYCLOHEXANE 
ing low temperature adsorption could be explained in different ways. The dissociative 
adsorption of hydrogen could become a more and more activated process with in- 
creasing anounts of the second metal 131: In this case the high temperature adsorp- 
tion should be larger than the low temperature adsorption, but this is not in accord- 
ance with our results (Fig. 1). Additional experinaents with a bimetallic catalyst 
(Sn/Pt = 0.5) proved that the adsorbed amounts at 373 K and 473 K are larger than 
at 573 K. These results do not indicate an activated adsorption. 
On Pt foils a completely reversible adsorption of hydrogen has been found ]41: 
Therefore, we assume a predominantly nonacfivated adsorption. In this case nH 
represents the sum of strongly and weakly bound hydrogen, and nrts 
 only the 
strongly bound hydrogen. The difference nH3-n73 must be an approximate 
value of the more weakly bound hydrogen. The known existence of different ad- 
sorption phases in this temperature range /5/ is neglected in this calculatioa. As is 
seen in Fig. 1, the weaker adsorption is drastically suppressed by the second metal. 
The slight increase of the high temperature ' adsorption remains an open question. 
_ 
It may be caused by a small increase in Pt dispersity or by a spillover to the sec- 
ond metal species. 
With increasing amount of the bimetal, hydrogen adsorption at 273 K decreases 
but oxygen adsorption increases. This opposite trend cannot be due to a variation 
of the Pt particle size. Therefore, the proposal of Bacaud et al. ]2/ to determine 
the particle size of Pt in Pt-Sn catalysts by chemisorption of hydrogen or oxygen 
cannot be a method of general applicability. No increase of the particle size in bi- 
metallic catalysts could be observed by x-rays !i/. 
The reason of the strongly influenced adsorption capacity of Pt in bimetallic 
catalysts should be a chemical modification of Pt by Pb or Sn according to a tgand 
effect. 
Electronic interactions between Pt and Sn ]1/ and Pt and Pb 16] have been ob- 
served in spectroscopic investigations. In Pt-Sn alloys a decrease of deuterium ad- 
sorption has been found arid is discussed as a ligand effect, too, although an en- 
semble effect is not excluded /3/. 
The observed increase of oxygen adsorption on the bimetallic catalysts (Fig. I) 
may at least partly be due to oxygen adsorption on reduced Sn or Pb species. An 
adsorption of oxygen on tin in Pt-Sn/A12 O3 catalysts recently was assumed by 
MuUer et al. /7/. 
2. Dehydrogenation of Cyctohexane 
The conversion of cyclohexane has been studied in the temperature range be. 
tween 530 K and 620 K. Arrhenius plots were made using a zero order rate equa-

tion; the yield of benzene was corrected by the equilibrium concentration of cyclo- 
hexane. 
The activities per g Pt of catalysts with various amounts of Pb or Sn and con- 
stant amount of 0.5 wt. % Pt are shown in Fig. 2. With increasing addition of Pb 
or Sn the rate of dehydrogenation is decreased and the activation energy increases. 
Small amounts of Sn poison stronger than Pb. 
The addition of the bimetal causes both a decrease in activity and a decrease 
in hydrogen adsorption. A correlation could be found between the weak adsorp- 
tion of hydrogen and the activity in dehydrogenation. In Fig. 3 the activities of 
several Pt-Pb, Pt-Sn and Pt catalysts, shown in Fig. 2, are plotted against the 
amounts of weakly adsorbed hydrogen on the corresponding catalysts, calculated 
from data shown in Fig. 1. The result is a linear correlation for all Pt, Pt-Pb and 
Pt-Sn catdysts. This means that the number of weakly adsorbed hydrogen atoms 
is proportional to the number of active sites in the dehydrogenation process. The 
sites occupied at 573 K by strongly bound hydrogen seem to be inactive in the 
abstraction of hydrogen from the hydrocarbon and its desorption into the gas 
phase. There are certain hints in the literature in support of this conclusion. Aben 
et al. 181 could correlate weakly adsorbed hydrogen with the activity in benzene 
hydrogenation on Pt. Ethene hydrogenation increases with decreasing initial heat 
of hydrogen adsorption 19[, whereas strongly bound hydrogen has a retarding ef- 
fect in hydrogenation IlO[.
