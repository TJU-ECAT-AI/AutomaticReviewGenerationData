Abstract
The effect of the presence of zinc on the catalytic behaviour of platinum in the vapour phase hydrogenation of crotonaldehyde (2-butenal)
and in iso-butane dehydrogenation has been determined in activated carbon-supported catalysts prepared using H2PtCl6 and Zn(NO3)2 as the
metal precursors. The catalysts have been characterised by temperature-programmed reduction (TPR), adsorption microcalorimetry of CO at
room temperature and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy after in situ reduction at 773 K. The bimetallic catalyst, with a bulk Zn/Pt atomic
ratio of 13.7, showed a much higher initial activity in crotonaldehyde hydrogenation, although it deactivated more strongly with time on
stream. Lower activation energy for this reaction was also obtained, as well as a higher selectivity towards the unsaturated alcohol. On the
other hand, the catalytic behaviour for iso-butane dehydrogenation was greatly improved by the presence of zinc, the bimetallic catalyst being
more active than its monometallic counterpart and showing 100% selectivity to iso-butene.

1. Introduction
The modification of the catalytic behaviour of a noble
metal through the addition of a second non-active metal able
to form alloy phases or intermetallic compounds with the
former is an interesting field in heterogeneous catalysis. As
an example, the platinumtin system supported on alumina
is widely used in naphtha reforming and alkane dehydro-
genation reactions, where it exhibits higher activity and
stability than monometallic platinum catalysts [1]. Some
recent papers have dealt with the use of Pt-Sn/Al2O3
catalysts for the dehydrogenation of iso-butane [2,3], n-
butane [4] and propane [57]. Iso-butane dehydrogenation
has also been studied over PtSn supported on silica [812]
and on L-zeolite [9,12,13]. Other important applications of
bimetallic Pt-Sn catalysts include the oxidation of carbon
monoxide [1417] and the selective hydrogenation of the
carbonyl bond in a,b-unsaturated aldehydes (acrolein,
crotonaldehyde, 3-methylcrotonaldehyde, etc.) to yield
unsaturated alcohols [1822]. For this latter reaction, it
has been shown that the catalytic performance depends on
the Sn/Pt atomic ratio, the preparation method and, chiefly,
on the interaction between platinum and tin species, both in
the metallic state and in oxidised states.
The PtZn system resembles in some aspects the PtSn
system. Platinum and zinc can also form alloy phases of
different stoichiometries (PtZn, Pt3Zn, among others),
which may show distinctive catalytic behaviour as compared
to monometallic platinum. Furthermore, ZnO has n-type
semiconductor character and thus, a strong interaction
between platinum and ZnO can be expected. The use of ZnO
as a support for platinum in different reactions is currently
being the subject of an intense research work. For example,
it has been reported that Pt/ZnO catalysts can achieve
99% selectivity at 45% conversion in the dehydrogenation
of iso-butane to iso-butene at 723 K [23]. In the field of
selective hydrogenations, Consonni et al. have studied
Pt/ZnO catalysts in the vapour phase hydrogenation of
crotonaldehyde, and they concluded that the selectivity to
the unsaturated alcohol (crotyl alcohol) increased with the
extent of alloy formation [24]. A similar favourable effect of

zinc has been recently obtained in our laboratory when
studying catalysts prepared by impregnation of zinc-
exchanged NaX zeolites with H2PtCl6 [25]. The bimetallic
catalysts showed enhanced selectivity towards the hydro-
genation of the C O bond of crotonaldehyde as compared to
the monometallic platinum catalyst, although the catalytic
activity was considerably reduced. The results were
explained on the basis of the formation of PtZn alloy
phases after the reduction of Zn(II) species, which was
observed to be favoured by the presence of the noble metal.
In fact, DFT calculations for the adsorption of ethylene and
formaldehyde on Pt(1 1 1), Pt3Zn(1 1 1) and PtZn(0 1 1)
surfaces have demonstrated that addition of zinc to platinum
weakens the adsorption of both olefinic (C C) and carbonyl
(C O) bonds, but the effect is more important for the former
[26]. This means that whereas on Pt catalysts, the adsorption
trough the C C double bond is highly favoured, on PtZn
catalysts, the adsorption of the carbonyl bond on PtZn
bridge sites is able to compete with that of the C C double
bond. Thus, these results could explain the enhanced
selectivity of Pt-Zn catalysts in the hydrogenation of a,b-
unsaturated aldehydes.
The use of zinc as promoter or support for selective
hydrogenation reactions is not limited to platinum catalysts.
It has been recently reported that Au/ZnO catalysts were also
selective for the formation of crotyl alcohol in the vapour
phase
hydrogenation
of
crotonaldehyde
[27,28].
The
reaction was carried out at a relatively high temperature
(523 K), and a much higher selectivity to the unsaturated
alcohol was found with Au/ZnO than with Au/SiO2 under
the same reaction conditions. In addition, the selectivity
increased with the reduction temperature, from 523 to
673 K, in such a way that it achieved a maximum of 82% for
Au/ZnO reduced at 673 K. The superior performance of Au/
ZnO catalysts was explained by the formation of interfacial
sites adjacent to Au particles that can activate the reactant
and facilitate its hydrogenation. The same authors have
recently reported the catalytic behaviour of Ag/ZnO
catalysts in the same reaction. Selectivities to crotyl alcohol
of about 70% were obtained during reaction at 523 K [29].
This paper compares the catalytic behaviour of two
activated carbon-supported catalysts, monometallic Pt and
bimetallic PtZn, in two very different reactions: the vapour
phase hydrogenation of crotonaldehyde and the dehydro-
genation of iso-butane. Carbonaceous materials are being
more and more frequently used as catalyst supports [30].
They contribute with a high surface area and, in bimetallic
systems such as PtZn, their inertness favours the interaction
between both metals, whereas undesired interactions with
the support are avoided.
2. Experimental
The support used was a commercial activated carbon
from Norit (Norit RX-3). It had a BET surface area (N2,
77 K)
of
1350 m2 g1
and
micropore
volumes
of
0.67 cm3 g1
(N2,
77 K,
Dubinin-Radushkevich)
and
0.30 cm3 g1 (CO2, 273 K, Dubinin-Radushkevich). The
bimetallic Pt-Zn catalyst was prepared by sequential
impregnation of the previously dried support (383 K,
overnight). First, zinc was deposited by impregnation
(100 cm3 of solution per gram of support) with an aqueous
solution of Zn(NO3)26H2O (from Aldrich, 98% purity) of
the appropriate concentration to obtain a Zn loading of
1 wt.%. The excess of solvent was removed by flowing
nitrogen through the slurry at 333 K and the remaining solid
was dried overnight at 383 K and heat treated in flowing
helium (50 cm3 min1) at 673 K for 4 h (heating rate:
5 K min1) to decompose the nitrate precursor. After this
treatment, platinum was deposited by impregnation with an
acetone solution of H2PtCl6 of the appropriate concentration
to load 0.2 wt.%. Once again, the excess of solvent was
removed and the catalyst dried as described previously. No
calcination was carried out at this stage. A monometallic Pt
catalyst was prepared in a similar way for the sake of
comparison. The metallic content in the catalysts was
determined by atomic absorption spectroscopy (AAS) using
a Varian SpectrAA 220FS spectrometer.
The chemical surface analysis of the catalysts, both in
fresh and reduced states, was studied by X-ray photoelectron
spectroscopy (XPS). Zinc in the bimetallic catalyst was also
analyzed by Auger electron spectroscopy (AES), simulta-
neously to the XPS measurements. The spectra were
acquired with a VG-Microtech Multilab 3000 spectrometer
equipped with a hemispherical electron analyser and a Mg
Ka (hn = 1253.6 eV, 1 eV = 1.6302  1019 J) 300 W X-
ray source. The powder samples were pressed into small
Inox cylinders and then mounted on a sample rod placed in a
pre-treatment chamber and reduced in flowing H2 at 773 K
for 1 h (heating rate: 5 K min1), before being transferred to
the analysis chamber. The analysis of fresh samples, without
any reduction treatment, was also carried out for the sake of
comparison. Before recording the spectra, the sample was
maintained in the analysis chamber until a residual pressure
of ca. 5  109 mbar was reached. The spectra were
collected at a pass energy of 50 eV. The intensities were
estimated by calculating the integral of each peak, after
subtraction of the S-shaped background, and by fitting the
experimental curve to a combination of Lorentzian (30%)
and Gaussian (70%) lines. All binding energies were
