Pt/[Fe]ZSM-5 modified by Na and Cs cations: an active and selective
catalyst for dehydrogenation of n-alkanes to n-alkenes

Pt clusters within [Fe]ZSM-5 channels provide active and stable
sites for the selective catalytic dehydrogenation of n-alkanes to
n-alkenes. Cs and Na cations titrate acid sites and inhibit
skeletal isomerization and cracking side reactions.
Linear alkenes are essential intermediates in the synthesis of
useful chemicals, such as lubricants1 and detergent-range alkyl-
aromatics.2 Alkane dehydrogenation reactions are endothermic
and favored by high temperatures and low H2 pressures; these
conditions lead, in turn, to cracking side reactions and fast
deactivation, especially for larger alkanes. Pt-based catalysts are
among the most active and selective for alkane dehydrogenation.3
Until this study, high dehydrogenation rates and catalyst stability
have required the concurrent presence of H2 (.200 kPa) and the
use of promoters or stabilizers (e.g. Cl to enhance Pt dispersion,4
Sn to improve stability,5 and Li to neutralize support acid sites6).
We previously reported that Pt/Na[Fe]ZSM-5 materials,
prepared by ion-exchange of Pt onto Na[Fe]ZSM-5, showed
unprecedented rates and stability in the selective dehydrogenation
of C2C4 alkanes.7 These materials, when used as catalysts
for larger alkanes, gave significant isomerization selectivities,
apparently because acidic OH groups form during reduction of
exchanged Pt cations by H2. Here, we report that the titration of
these protons with Cs after reduction of Pt cations leads to Pt/Na
[Fe]ZSM-5 materials with high selectivity for dehydrogenation of
n-alkanes to linear n-alkenes and also with high rates and excellent
catalyst stability. Low deactivation rates (first-order deactivation
rate constant: 0.0030.006 h21) were achieved at much lower H2
pressures (7 kPa) than required in previous reports (.200 kPa)
and even without H2.
Pt/Na[Fe]ZSM-5
catalysts
were
prepared
as
previously
reported.7 NH4
+[Fe]ZSM-5 was exchanged thrice with 0.1 M
NaNO3 solutions (EMD Chemicals, .99%) at 353 K for 15 h
to prepare Na[Fe]ZSM-5 precursors. Pt cations were then
exchanged onto these samples by contact with [(NH3)4Pt](NO3)2
solutions (6.25 6 1025 M; Aldrich, 99.995%) for 12 h at 353 K,
filtered, washed with deionized water, and treated in flowing dry
air (1.67 cm3 s21) for 12 h at 723 K (0.017 K s21). These samples
contained 0.12 wt% Pt, 0.28 wt% Fe, and a Si/Fe atomic ratio of
340
(by
inductively-coupled
plasma
emission
spectroscopy).
[Fe]ZSM-5 crystals had an average diameter of 0.5 mm (from
transmission electron microscopy). n-Pentane (25 kPa, Aldrich,
99%) and n-heptane (25 kPa, Aldrich, 99%) dehydrogenation
rates and selectivities were measured at 673 and 723 K at ambient
pressure using a tubular flow reactor with plug-flow hydro-
dynamics. Samples (0.1 g, 180250 mm diameter pellets) were
treated in 40% H2 (Praxair, 99.999%, 0.20 cm3 s21) in He
(Praxair, 99.999%, 0.30 cm3 s21) at 673 K for 2 h. Reactant and
product concentrations were measured by gas chromatography
(HP 5890 II). n-Pentane and n-heptane reactants were introduced
using a high-pressure syringe pump (Teledyne Isco, Model 500 D).
Dehydrogenation rates were calculated from measured rates, by
correcting for approach to equilibrium for each alkene isomer
using thermodynamic data.8
Fig. 1 shows pentene formation rates (per Pt) and selectivities
(on a carbon basis) on Pt/Na[Fe]ZSM-5 at 673 K during contact
with reactants for 140 h. The selectivity to pentenes increased
from 85% to 96% during this period and cracking selectivities
concurrently decreased to y1%. The selectivity to aromatics
also decreased from 8% to y2%. This inhibition of cracking
and aromatization reactions reflects the slow deactivation of
acid sites by unreactive organic deposits during dehydrogenation
reactions.7 These lower selectivities may also reflect, in part,
smaller contributions from secondary reactions as the alkane
conversion level decreases with time on stream. Pentene formation
rates (corrected for approach to equilibrium) decreased from
5.7 mol (g-atom Pt)21 s21 (n-pentane conversion: 25%) to
1.5 mol (g-atom Pt)21 s21 (n-pentane conversion: 11%) over
140 h. Deactivation was initially rapid (kd = 0.025 h21), but
became slower with time, with a first-order deactivation constant
of 0.004 h21 after 20 h. These deactivation rates resemble those
previously reported on Pt/Na[Fe]ZSM-5 during C2C4 alkane

dehydrogenation7 and correspond to a mean catalyst lifetime of
250 h, a value larger than typically reported at the severe condi-
tions required for high alkene yields in alkane dehydrogenation
reactions.
[Fe]ZSM-5 zeolites have weaker Brnsted acid sites than their
Al homologs.9 Protons form in Pt/Na[Fe]ZSM-5 during reduc-
tion of exchanged Pt cations. These acid sites catalyze skeletal
isomerization of n-pentenes at 673 K to form branched pentenes
(3-methyl-1-butene, 2-methyl-1-butene, 2-methyl-2-butene) and
lead to equilibrium distributions of pentene isomers (approach to
equilibrium from n-pentane y0.4 for all isomers; Table 1). These
protons were titrated after reduction of Pt/Na[Fe]ZSM-5 by
impregnation with a solution of Cs acetate (Cs/Fe = 1). Cs was
chosen because it is less mobile than Na under hydrothermal
conditions prevalent during drying or regeneration thermal
treatments.
These CsPt/Na[Fe]ZSM-5 samples gave much higher selec-
tivities to linear pentenes (96%) than Pt/Na[Fe]ZSM-5 (28%).
Cracking and aromatic products were not detected after Cs
introduction at any time on stream, consistent with the stoichio-
metric titration of Brnsted acid sites by Cs. Pentadienes (y3%
selectivity) became the predominant by-products, because of
sequential dehydrogenation reactions of linear pentenes. These
dienes react quickly on acid sites via DielsAlder type reactions to
give aromatics and unsaturated organic residues and are quickly
scavenged on catalysts containing acid sites. Forward pentene
formation rates and selectivities are shown in Fig. 1 on CsPt/Na
[Fe]ZSM-5 at 673 K. The deactivation rate constant (kd =
0.007 h21) was slightly higher than that on Pt/Na[Fe]ZSM-5
(0.004 h21), apparently because of the higher concentrations of
polyunsaturated precursors (e.g. dienes), which are otherwise
scavenged by acid sites on Pt/Na[Fe]ZSM-5 catalysts. The high
reactivity and stability of Pt domains in [Fe]ZSM-5 channels for
dehydrogenation reflects in part the small size of encapsulated Pt
clusters with 58% dispersion (defined as the percentage of Pt atoms
exposed at surfaces; estimated by H2 chemisorption at 293 K);
these dispersion values are significantly higher than in previously
reported catalysts based on Pt/Al2O3 (2035% dispersion).10 Small
Pt domains, prepared by anchoring Pt precursors onto exchange
sites of [Fe]ZSM-5, give higher reaction rates because of the
concomitant higher densities of exposed Pt atoms. These small
clusters also inhibit the formation of deactivating residues because
oligomerization reactions require larger ensembles and more open
environments than those present within the zeolite channels that
contain the active Pt clusters in these materials.11
We have also examined the more demanding dehydrogenation
of larger alkanes (n-heptane) on CsPt/Na[Fe]ZSM-5. These
larger alkanes are more reactive in acid-catalyzed cracking and
skeletal isomerization than their smaller homologs. n-Heptane
dehydrogenation at 673 K formed linear heptenes with high
selectivity (87% initial combined selectivity to 1-heptene, trans-2-
heptene, cis-2-heptene, trans-3-heptene, cis-3-heptene). Selectivities
to linear heptenes increased with time on stream (to 92% after
100 h) (Fig. 2). Heptadienes were the most abundant by-products,
as a result of sequential dehydrogenation of initial n-heptene
products; their selectivities decreased with time on stream (from
initial 12% to 7% after 100 h) because of the concomitant decrease
in n-heptane conversion with time and of the resulting smaller
contribution from sequential reactions of primary n-heptene
products. Reaction rates were lower with n-heptane than with
n-pentane in the linear region of the ratetime data shown in Fig. 1
and 2, apparently because of the faster initial deactivation observed
for the larger alkanes at the high conversion and high diene
concentrations prevalent during the initial contact of the catalyst
with reactants.
The addition of small amounts of H2 (7 kPa) to n-heptane
reactants decreased the prevalent concentration of heptadienes and
improved catalyst stability. H2 typically increases catalyst stability
during dehydrogenation reactions,12 but also decreases equilibrium
conversion levels. We compensated for these thermodynamic
effects by slightly increasing reaction temperatures (from 673
to 723 K). Deactivation rate constants were slightly smaller
(0.003 h21) with 7 kPa H2 at 723 K than without adding H2 at
673 K (0.004 h21) (Fig. 2). These deactivation rate constants
resemble those reported on PtSn/Al2O3ClLi (0.003 h21); these
latter values required, however, much higher H2 pressures

(220 kPa)12 (Table 2). Heptene formation rates (compared
per Pt, because dispersion were not reported in the earlier study12)
on CsPt/Na[Fe]ZSM-5 were almost ten-fold higher than
on PtSn/Al2O3ClLi catalysts12 at similar conditions (Table 2).
This
latter
catalyst
is
the
only
practical
dehydrogenation
catalyst reported for the synthesis of linear alkenes from larger
n-alkanes. No branched heptenes were detected during n-heptane
reactions
and
linear
heptene
isomers
were
in
equilibrium
with each other on the catalysts reported here at all reaction
conditions (Table 2).
In summary, we provide evidence here for the unique catalytic
properties of Pt/Na[Fe]ZSM-5 with residual acid sites titrated by
Cs after reduction of exchanged Pt cations for the dehydrogena-
tion of n-pentane and n-heptane. These materials catalyze
dehydrogenation of larger n-alkanes with unprecedented rates
and with very high selectivity to n-alkenes. The catalyst stability is
excellent in comparison with catalytic materials in previous
reports, which required much higher H2 pressures for stable
operation. These catalysts provide effective routes for the synthesis
of useful linear alkenes using the corresponding n-alkanes as
feedstocks. Our study extends the applicability of these materials
beyond their initial disclosure for dehydrogenation of C2C4
alkanes. It also provides compelling evidence that Brnsted acid
sites must be rigorously excluded to preserve the desired linear
nature of the alkenes formed in dehydrogenation turnovers.
