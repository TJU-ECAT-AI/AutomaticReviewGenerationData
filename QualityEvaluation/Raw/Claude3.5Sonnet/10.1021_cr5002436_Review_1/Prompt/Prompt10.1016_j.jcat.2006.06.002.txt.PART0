Abstract
Sintering inhibition mechanism of Pt in Pt/ceria-based oxide catalyst under oxidizing condition at high temperature was studied by several
analysis techniques. Pt in a Pt/ceria-based oxide catalyst did not sinter after aging treatment at 800 C in air, but did sinter in a Pt/Al2O3 catalyst.
Using X-ray absorption analysis, we found that the PtOCe bond (i.e., the Pt-oxidesupport interaction) acted as an anchor and inhibited the
sintering of Pt particles on ceria-based oxide. As a result of further systematic investigation on various Pt catalysts, clearly there was an excellent
correlation between the strength of the Pt-oxidesupport interaction and the electron density of oxygen in the support oxide. The sintering
inhibition effect on Pt can be controlled by the electron density of oxygen in the support through the Pt-oxidesupport interaction.

1. Introduction
Three-way catalysts (TWCs) can efficiently purify harmful
automobile emissions. Ever since TWCs were commercialized
in the U.S. and Japan in 1977 [1], they have played an impor-
tant role in environmental protection. Recently, in concert with
growing demands for global environmental protection, more
stringent regulations have been imposed on automobile indus-
tries. Therefore, automobile companies are making strong ef-
forts to clean up automobile exhaust, and technical innovation
for more advanced TWCs needs to be encouraged.
Basically, a TWC consists of precious metals such as Pt
and Rh, supports such as Al2O3, and ceria-based oxide as an
oxygen storage component [24]. The precious metal parti-
cles are a few nanometers in diameter and are dispersed on
a support oxide. These precious metals act as the active site
to simultaneously purify harmful automotive exhaust, such as

nitrogen oxides (NOx), carbon monoxide (CO), and unburned
hydrocarbons (HC). When the TWC is exposed to high temper-
atures (800 C and above), the precious metal agglomerates
and sinters, decreasing the active surface area [58]. Generally,
the sintering of the precious metal particles during operation
causes a decrease in catalytic activity (i.e., degradation). More-
over, exhaust conditions from an automotive gasoline engine
fluctuate between oxidative and reductive atmospheres during
vehicle operation. Specifically, the activity of Pt-supported cat-
alysts decreases significantly after high-temperature aging in an
oxidative atmosphere due to the sintering of Pt particles com-
pared with that in a reductive atmosphere [5,6]. Therefore, the
development of highly durable catalysts without Pt sintering in
an oxidative atmosphere is highly desirable in automotive in-
dustrial research.
Ceria-based oxide is widely used for automotive catalysts
because of its performance not only in storing/releasing oxy-
gen, but also in stabilizing precious metal dispersion [2,9].
Several studies have been conducted on the Pt sintering and Pt
support interaction in Pt/ceria catalysts, and significant progress

in knowledge has been made. Diwell et al. [10] reported that
formation of a Ptceria complex under oxidizing conditions
could maintain Pt stability against sintering. In addition, using
a laser Raman technique, Murrell et al. [11] showed that the
precious metal oxide structure interacts strongly with the ceria
surface. However, the nature of the Ptceria interaction remains
very complicated, and there is room for further investigation.
In this paper we explore the sintering inhibition mechanism
of Pt particles on ceria-based oxide at the atomic level using
X-ray absorption analysis. Then we conduct further systematic
investigation on various Pt catalysts and clarify the essence of
the Pt-oxidesupport interaction and its relationship to Pt sin-
tering in an oxidizing atmosphere.
2. Experimental
2.1. Catalyst preparation and aging treatment
Pt/Al2O3 and Pt/ceria-based mixed oxide (CeZrY mixed
oxide, referred to as CZY) catalysts were prepared by the fol-
lowing methods. Al2O3 as a support oxide was supplied by
Nikki Universal; its crystal structure was γ -type. CZY powder
as a support oxide was prepared using a coprecipitation process
with aqueous NH3 using Ce(NO3)3, ZrO(NO3)2, and Y(NO3)3
in aqueous solutions. The precipitate was dried at 110 C and
calcined in air at 700 C for 3 h. CZY contains 50 wt% CeO2,
46 wt% ZrO2, and 4 wt% Y2O3, and its crystal structure is cu-
bic. Preparation of 2 wt% Pt/Al2O3 and 2 wt% Pt/CZY catalysts
was done by the conventional wet impregnation of Al2O3 and
CZY powders with Pt(NH3)2(NO2)2 aqueous solution. The im-
pregnated powders were dried overnight at 110 C and calcined
at 500 C for 3 h in air. These samples are referred to as fresh
catalyst. Portions of the fresh sample were aged in air for 5 h
at 800 C. This aging treatment corresponds to an accelerated
test for durability in an oxidative atmosphere. These samples
are referred to as aged catalysts. Pt/SiO2, Pt/ZrO2, Pt/TiO2,
and Pt/CeO2 for a systematic study were prepared by the afore-
mentioned method, using commercial support oxides, and aged
as just described.
The aged Pt/CZY was reduced by 5% H2 (N2 balance) at
400 C for 30 min. The reduced sample was cooled to room
temperature, then placed in a bag with an oxygen scavenger to
avoid oxidation. Aged and fresh samples were placed into a bag
without an oxygen scavenger. The samples in the bag were used
for the XAFS experiments.
2.2. Characterization
2.2.1. Adsorption methods
The specific surface areas of the samples were estimated us-
ing the N2 adsorption isotherm at 196 C by the one-point
BrunauerEmmettTeller (BET) method using an automatic
surface analyzer (Micro Sorp 4232II, Micro Data). The sam-
ples were pretreated in flowing N2 at 200 C for 20 min. The
BET surface areas of the fresh and aged catalysts examined for
this study, along with information on the support, are summa-
rized in Table 1.

b Fresh samples were aged in air for 5 h at 800 C.
The average particle size of Pt metal was determined using a
CO pulse adsorption method [12]. The catalysts were pretreated
in flowing pure oxygen, followed by pure hydrogen at 400 C.
With this reductive treatment of hydrogen, Pt was reduced to
Pt metal. CO pulse adsorption was carried out in flowing He at
78 C. At this temperature, CO uptake on ceria support was
almost entirely suppressed, and CO was adsorbed to only the
surface of Pt [13]. The average particle size was calculated from
the CO uptake assuming that CO was adsorbed on the surface of
spherical Pt particles at CO/(surface Pt atom) = 1/1 stoichiom-
etry.
2.2.2. Structure analysis
Microstructure of the catalysts was investigated by transmis-
sion electron microscopy (TEM) using a JEOL JEM-2000EX.
The powder XRD experiments were carried out in air at room
temperature using a RINT2000 (Rigaku) diffractometer with
CuKα radiation (1.5406 Å). The catalyst samples were reduced
by 5% H2 (N2 balance) at 400 C for 30 min before the XRD
measurements. The catalyst powder was pressed into wafers
and affixed to standard-sized microscope slides. The average
particle size of Pt was estimated from the Pt(111) line width
using Scherrers equation with the Gaussian line shape approx-
imation.
The Pt L3-edge (11.5 keV) X-ray absorption fine structure
(XAFS) measurement was carried out at BL01B1 and BL16B2
of SPring-8 (Hyogo, Japan). The storage ring energy was op-
erated at 8 GeV with a typical current of 100 mA. The XAFS
spectra at Pt L3-edge were measured using a Si(111) double-
crystal monochromator in fluorescence mode at room temper-
ature in air. Data reduction of the XAFS was carried out as
described elsewhere [14]. The curve-fitting analysis of the EX-
AFS spectra was performed for the inverse Fourier transforms
on the Ptoxygen and Ptcation (cation = Pt, Ce, and Zr) shells
using theoretical parameters calculated by McKale et al. [15].
The X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements
were carried out using a PHI model 5500MC with MgKα
X-rays. The catalyst sample was placed on a grid and pretreated
under 0.5 atm O2 pressure at 500 C for 5 min. The pretreated

sample was cooled to room temperature and then transferred to
the XPS measurement stage without being exposed to air at-
mosphere. The oxygen 1s core electron levels in support oxides
were recorded to evaluate the chemical property of the support.
Binding energies were calibrated with respect to Pt(4f7/2) at
71.4 eV.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Sintering of Pt particles in Pt/Al2O3 and Pt/CZY catalysts
First, the Pt sintering behavior in Pt/Al2O3 and Pt/CZY cat-
alysts was investigated. Fig. 1 shows the transmission electron
microscopy (TEM) images of the Pt/Al2O3 and Pt/CZY cata-
lysts after aging treatment at 800 C in air for 5 h. In the aged
Pt/Al2O3, large Pt particles ranging from 3 to 150 nm were ob-
served. In contrast, no explicit Pt particles were observed on the
aged Pt/CZY. In the aged Pt/CZY, Pt was detected by energy
dispersive X-ray (EDX) analysis. This indicates that Pt parti-
cles are highly dispersed on the CZY support.
The average size of Pt metal particles for these catalysts was
determined by XRD and the CO pulse method (Table 2). The

diffraction peaks from the Pt particles in both fresh Pt/Al2O3
and Pt/CZY could not be detected by XRD because of their
small particle size. Pt particle size on the Al2O3 support before
the aging treatment, as estimated by the CO pulse method, was
almost the same as that on CZY (about 1 nm diameter). This
situation changed significantly after the aging. Pt particle size
increased significantly in Pt/Al2O3 during the aging treatment;
particle sizes in the aged Pt/Al2O3 determined by XRD and CO
pulse methods were 61 and 23.6 nm, respectively. On the other
hand, Pt particles in the Pt/CZY could not be observed by XRD
even after aging, suggesting that the Pt particles on CZY sup-
port remained highly dispersed. The Pt particle size of 1.1 nm in
the aged Pt/CZY estimated by CO pulse was the same as that in
the fresh catalyst. This indicates that Pt in the Pt/CZY catalyst
did not sinter at all after the aging treatment.
3.2. XAFS analysis of Pt/Al2O3 and Pt/CZY catalysts after
aging
To clarify the cause of the inhibited sintering of Pt in Pt/CZY,
the state of Pt atoms supported on Al2O3 or CZY was investi-
gated by XAFS. Generally, the XAFS spectra can be divided
into two spectral regions: the X-ray absorption near-edge struc-
ture (XANES) and extended X-ray absorption fine-structure
(EXAFS) regions. We can get information on the electronic
state from XANES analysis [16] and on the local structure
around a target element from EXAFS analysis [17].
3.2.1. Pt L3-edge XANES spectra
Fig. 2 shows the XANES spectra at Pt L3-edge for the aged
catalysts and reference samples. The steeply rising absorption
edge is referred to as the white line. In the case of the Pt
L-edge XANES, the absorption intensity of the white line re-
flects the vacancy in the 5d orbital of Pt atoms [16]. A large
white line was observed on oxidized Pt, whereas a small white
line was observed on reduced Pt. Therefore, it is possible to
estimate the average oxidation state of the Pt atoms in each sam-
ple. The white line intensity of Pt/Al2O3 was the same as that
of Pt foil, suggesting that Pt on Al2O3 was in the Pt0 (metal)
state after aging. In contrast, the white line intensity of Pt/CZY
was similar to that of PtO2, suggesting that the Pt2+ and Pt4+
species with a high oxidation state were present mainly in the
aged Pt/CZY. The average oxidation state of Pt can be quan-
titatively evaluated from the white line intensity [18]. A linear
relationship exists between the white line intensity and the oxi-

dation state of PtOx on some metal oxide supports. On the basis
of this linear relationship, the estimated oxidation state of Pt
was 0 in the aged Pt/Al2O3 and 3.53 in the aged Pt/CZY.
Generally, it is well known that PtO2 decomposes to Pt metal
under oxidizing conditions at around 600 C and above accord-
ing to the thermodynamic phase diagram [19]. The finding that
Pt on Al2O3 was in the Pt0 state after aging at 800 C in the ox-
idizing atmosphere was consistent with the thermodynamics.
On the other hand, the CZY support could stabilize a high-
oxidation state of Pt even after aging. Thus, it is suggested that
the strong Ptsupport interaction in the Pt/CZY under the oxi-
dizing condition causes stabilization of the high-oxidation state
of Pt.
3.2.2. Fourier transforms of Pt L3-edge EXAFS spectra
Fourier transforms (FTs) of the aged catalysts and reference
samples are presented in Fig. 3. The FTs were performed on
the Pt L3-edge EXAFS spectra in the ca. 3.016 Å1 region.
The quantitative curve-fitting analysis of the EXAFS spectra
was performed for the inverse FTs on the Ptoxygen and Pt
cation (cation = Pt, Ce and Zr) shells, respectively. The results
of curve-fitting analysis are summarized in Table 3. The FTs are
not corrected for phase shift; therefore, the peaks in the FTs are
shifted to lower R values. The values of bond length in the text
and table are corrected for phase shift. In the FT spectrum of
Pt foil, the peak at 2.76 Å is assigned to the PtPt bond. In the

FT spectrum of PtO2 powder, the peaks at 2.04 and 3.10 Å are
assigned to the PtO and PtOPt bonds, respectively. The FT
spectrum of Pt/Al2O3 after aging was obviously different from
that of the Pt/CZY. As for the aged Pt/Al2O3, only the intense
peak at 2.76 Å, which corresponds to the PtPt bond, was ob-
served. The FT spectrum of the Pt/Al2O3 coincided with that
of Pt foil. The coordination number (CN) of the PtPt shell in
the aged Pt/Al2O3 was 11.5, indicating that the Pt metal par-
ticles on Al2O3 after aging were at least 20 nm in size [20].
The FT spectrum of Pt/CZY after aging differed from those of
both Pt foil and PtO2 powder. The position of the first peak at
2.02 Å in Pt/CZY was close to that of PtO2, and this peak was
fitted with the PtO bond. It should be noted that the second ev-
ident peak, which was absent in both Pt foil and PtO2 powder,
was found at 3.01 Å. A curve-fitting simulation of this second
peak was carefully performed; Fig. 4 shows the results based
on the supposition that the second neighboring atom was Ce or
Pt. An excellent fitting result for the simulation of Ce was ob-
tained. In contrast, an appropriate fit could not be obtained for
Pt, because the EXAFS oscillation pattern of Pt was very differ-
ent than that of the experimental data. It is clear that the second
neighboring atom in the aged Pt/CZY is a Ce atom, not a Pt
atom. Curve-fitting analysis for the simulation of other cations,
such as Zr and Y, was also conducted to investigate the second
neighboring atom in the aged Pt/CZY, but an appropriate fit for
Ce compared with Zr(Y) could not be obtained. These results
led to the conclusion that Pt atoms interact strongly with the
CZY support during aging and form a PtOCe bond. The CN
of the PtCe shell in the aged Pt/CZY was 3.5. This CN of 3.5
is lower than the saturated CN of 12 in a cubic fluorite structure,
indicating that Pt ions exist on the surface of the CZY support.
In addition, intense PtPt or PtOPt peaks could not be ob-
served in the aged Pt/CZY, suggesting that there are no large
Pt metal or oxide particles on the CZY. In other words, highly
dispersed Pt oxides are present on the surface of the CZY sup-
port.
A similar PtO surface complex on CeO2 has been reported
by Murrell et al. [11], who stated that using Laser Raman
Spectroscopy, a strong Raman band at ca. 700 cm1 was ob-
served for Rh, Ir, Pd, and Pt dispersed on CeO2. This Raman
band was assigned to a surface oxide metalO formed on the
CeO2 surface. Metal oxides on CeO2 exhibit a Strong Oxide
Support Interaction (SOSI). Our XAFS results could give di-
rect evidence for the formation of a PtOCe bond on the sur-
face of ceria-based oxide support. Moreover, we showed that

this Pt-oxidesupport interaction is stronger on the CZY sur-
face than on the Al2O3 surface.
Generally, Pt0 (metal) is considered to be the active site for
the catalytic reaction in automotive exhaust conditions. The
CZY support could stabilize a high-oxidation state of Pt af-
ter aging. Therefore, Pt on the CZY support must be reducible
during the catalytic reaction. Fig. 5 shows the FTs of the aged
Pt/CZY, which is the same spectrum mentioned in Fig. 3, and
the reduced Pt/CZY after aging. The aged Pt/CZY was reduced
by 5% H2 at 400 C. After the reductive treatment, the PtO
peak in the aged Pt/CZY decreased significantly, and the Pt
OCe peak almost disappeared. In addition, intense PtPt peak
could not be observed in the reduced Pt/CZY. These results sug-
gest that the PtOCe bond breaks by the reductive treatment
and that Pt metal particles are highly dispersed on the CZY
support. According to the results from the CO pulse method
mentioned above, the estimated average size of Pt metal parti-
cles in the reduced Pt/CZY after the aging is ca. 1 nm.
3.3. Pt sintering inhibition mechanism
Based on our foregoing observations, we proposed the sin-
tering inhibition mechanism of Pt supported on CZY shown in
Fig. 6. In the case of Pt/Al2O3, because the interaction between
Pt and Al2O3 is weak, Pt particles transport across the surface
of the Al2O3 support and sinter during an aging treatment at
800 C in an oxidizing atmosphere according to the molecular
migration model [6,21,22]. In contrast, Pt supported on CZY
has a strong interaction with the CZY support. Therefore, the
CZY support stabilized a high-oxidation state of Pt, and then
the formation of the rigid PtOCe bond acts as an anchor.
Formation of the PtOCe bond on the CZY suppresses the
sintering of Pt. The highly dispersed Pt oxide on the surface
of CZY support under oxidizing conditions is considered to be
more stable, because the PtOCe bond energies are greater
than the PtPt bond energies in large Pt crystallites. In contrast,
during catalytic reactions under stoichiometric or reducing con-
ditions, the PtOCe bond on the CZY breaks, and Pt metal
particles are highly dispersed on the support.
It is well known that the sintering of supported metal not
only occurs via the foregoing metal migration, but also de-
creases in the support surface area during aging [6,21,22]. The
surface areas of the fresh and aged Pt/Al2O3 were 185 and
154 m2/g, respectively (Table 1). In contrast, the surface area
of Pt/CZY decreased from 99 to 58 m2/g, as shown in Table 1.
The aging treatment resulted in a 40% decrease in the surface
area of Pt/CZY. Although the Al2O3 support has a high thermal
stability compared with the CZY support, Pt particles on the
Al2O3 support sintered significantly. Therefore, the Pt sintering
was due mainly to Pt migration, not to the decreased surface
area of the support. As for the sintering inhibition mechanism,
the PtOCe bond (i.e., the Pt-oxidesupport interaction) in-
hibits Pt migration, which is the main reason why Pt supported
on CZY does not sinter during the high-temperature aging in
oxidative atmosphere.
3.4. Inhibition effect of Pt sintering and Pt-oxidesupport
interaction
Finally, we investigated the essence of the Pt-oxidesupport
interaction and its relationship to Pt sintering in an oxidizing
atmosphere. We tried to consider on what property of the sup-
port does the strength of Pt-oxidesupport interaction depend?
As has been pointed out, the PtOM (where M is the cation in
the support) bond is key to the Pt-oxidesupport interaction.
Therefore, it is reasonable to suppose that the electron density
of oxygen in the support oxide predominantly influences the
strength of the PtOM bond. As a result, the electron density
of oxygen in the support would be expected to control the sin-
tering of supported Pt particles. To verify this hypothesis, we
conducted a systematic investigation on various Pt-supported
108

Fig. 6. Model illustration of the Pt sintering inhibition mechanism for a Pt/ceria-based catalyst and a conventional Pt/Al2O3 catalyst. Since the PtAl2O3 interaction
is weak, Pt metal particles are formed and sintered during 800 C aging treatment in air. In contrast, Pt supported on CZY has a strong interaction with CZY support.
The generation of PtOCe bond prevents Pt particles from sintering during the aging treatment. After the reductive treatment, the PtOCe bond on the CZY
breaks, and Pt metal particles are highly dispersed on the support. The average size of Pt metal particles was estimated by a CO pulse adsorption method.

catalysts such as Pt/SiO2, Pt/TiO2, and others. Specifically, we
quantified the following three properties for various catalysts:
the electron density of oxygen in the support, the strength of the
Pt-oxidesupport interaction, and the sintering inhibition effect
on Pt. We also investigated the correlation among these prop-
erties. First, in terms of the electron density of oxygen in the
support, the binding energy of the O(1s) electron in the support
oxide was measured by XPS analysis. XPS spectra of the O(1s)
core level region in the supports are given in Fig. 7. Significant
changes in the spectra were observed. The binding energy of the
O(1s) electron decreased in the following order: SiO2, Al2O3,
ZrO2, TiO2, CeO2, and CZY.
Second, concerning quantification of the strength of the Pt-
oxidesupport interaction, we investigated the white line inten-
sity in the Pt L3-edge XANES spectra after the aging test in the
same way as the Pt/Al2O3 and Pt/CZY catalysts. As mentioned
Fig. 8. Pt-oxidesupport interaction and its relation to Pt sintering in an oxidiz-
ing atmosphere. The binding energy of the O(1s) electron in support oxide was
measured by XPS analysis. The oxidation state of Pt after aging was quantita-
tively evaluated from the white line intensity of the Pt L3-edge XANES spectra.
Pt particle size after aging was estimated by the CO pulse method.
above, Pt oxide decomposes to Pt metal under oxidizing condi-
tions at around 600 C and above. The strong Pt-oxidesupport
interaction stabilizes the high-oxidation state of Pt through gen-
eration of the PtOM bond after aging at 800 C in an oxi-
dizing atmosphere. Accordingly, it is reasonable to expect the
average oxidation state of Pt after aging to correspond to the
strength of the Pt-oxidesupport interaction. The average oxi-
dation state of Pt can be quantitatively evaluated from the white
line intensity in the same way as the Pt/Al2O3 and Pt/CZY cat-
alysts.
Third, in terms of the sintering inhibition effect on Pt, we
measured the average Pt particle size after the aging at 800 C in
an oxidizing atmosphere. The average size of the Pt metal par-
ticles was estimated using the CO pulse method. Fig. 8 shows

the correlations among these three factors on the various sup-
ported Pt catalysts. Clearly, these correlations are excellent.
The oxidation state of Pt after aging increased with decreasing
binding energy of the O(1s) electron. This indicates that the Pt-
oxidesupport interaction strengthened as the electron density
of oxygen of support oxide increased. Subsequently, Pt particle
size after the aging decreased as the electron density of oxygen
in the support increased. As a result, the sintering inhibition ef-
fect on Pt can be controlled by the electron density of oxygen
in the support oxide through the Pt-oxidesupport interaction.
This is the essence of the Pt-oxidesupport interaction and its
relationship to Pt sintering in an oxidizing atmosphere.
4. Conclusion
Using TEM, XRD, and CO pulse methods, we found that
Pt supported on ceria-based oxide (CZY) did not sinter un-
der oxidizing condition at 800 C, whereas Pt atoms on Al2O3
sintered significantly. Pt particles in the Pt/Al2O3 grew up to
23.6 nm (by the CO pulse method) during the aging treatment.
In contrast, Pt particles in the Pt/CZY after aging continued to
be highly dispersed with a diameter of about 1 nm.
Next, we clarified the sintering inhibition mechanism of Pt
particles on CZY at the atomic level using XAFS analysis.
Pt supported on CZY exhibited a strong interaction with the
CZY support; therefore, the CZY support stabilized the high-
oxidation state of Pt under oxidizing conditions at high temper-
atures and then the rigid PtOCe bond, that is, the Pt-oxide
support interaction generated. The PtOCe bond acted as an
anchor and inhibited Pt migration.
Finally, this report clearly shows the relationship between
the inhibitory affect of Pt sintering and Pt-oxidesupport in-
teraction. We conducted a systematic investigation on various
Pt-supported catalysts and quantified the physical and chemical
properties of various catalysts. There was an excellent corre-
lation between the strength of the Pt-oxidesupport interaction
and the electron density of oxygen in the support oxide. Conse-
quently, it is clear that the sintering inhibition effect on Pt can
be controlled by the electron density of oxygen in the support
through the Pt-oxidesupport interaction.
Using advanced analysis techniques, such as synchrotron
radiation-based analysis, the approach to catalytic design for
practical use should transit from trial-and-error to planned de-
sign and control. We hope that our report can lead the way to
the planned catalytic design.

First, you need to sequentially extract any quotes in the literature that are most relevant to each question, and print them in numbered order, separated by newlines. Quotes should be relatively brief. Do not attempt to summarize or answer questions at this stage, but simply repeat exactly what the corresponding part of the literature says.

Please enclose the full list of quotes in <quotes></quotes> XML tags. If there are no relevant quotes, write "No relevant quotes" instead.

Then, answer the question, starting with "Answer:".  Do not include or reference quoted content verbatim in the answer. Don't say "According to Quote [1]" when answering. Do not write reference number of quotes after answer. Put your answer to the user inside <EnglishVersionAnswer></EnglishVersionAnswer> XML tags. Output formatted text, with line breaks for each question.Separate quotes and answers with a blank line. Provide the answers to all questions in English. After completing the English answers, translate all those answers into Chinese and provide the Chinese version inside <ChineseVersionAnswer></ChineseVersionAnswer> XML tags.

Thus, the format of your overall response should look like what's shown between the <example></example> tags.  Make sure to follow the formatting and spacing exactly.
