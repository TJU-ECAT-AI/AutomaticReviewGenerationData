Abstract
Dehydrogenation of isobutane (iC4) to isobutene has recently received considerable attention because of the increasing demand for methyl
tertiary butyl ether (MTBE) and ethyl tertiary butyl ether (ETBE), as additives for gasoline to increase the octane number and to substitute lead.
Among several catalysts, PtSn/γ-Al2O3 catalyst is one of the most suitable ones. In this study, PtSn, PtSnK and PtSnLi catalysts
supported on γ-Al2O3 have been investigated. The catalysts were prepared by co-impregnation using H2PtCl6, SnCl2 as the metal precursors and
K2CrO4 and LiOH as the promoters. The obtained catalysts were characterized by TPR and XRD techniques. Reaction temperature, feed flow rate
(Q), iC4/H2 ratio and the catalyst type were the main variables that were investigated. Initially, primary experiments were carried out for the
identification of the optimum range of operating variables, then, Taguchi's algorithm was employed to design the experiment. The results revealed
that the PtSnK catalyst showed higher selectivity than PtSnLi. Under the optimum operating conditions i.e. at 550 C, feed flow rate of
50 cm3/min and iC4/H2 ratio of 1/3, selectivity toward isobutene of higher than 90% was achieved with the corresponding conversion values of
about 15%.

1. Introduction
There is a growing interest in catalytic dehydrogenation of
light alkanes due to the increase in the demand for olefins such
as propylene and isobutene [1,2]. Isobutene, a key component
of methyl tertiary butyl ether (MTBE) [3] and ethyl tertiary
butyl ether (ETBE), is a chemical used as an oxygenate for
reformulated gasoline [4,5]. Much research has been undertaken
on isobutene synthesis by oxidative, nonoxidative, as well as
steam cracking reaction conditions [6]. Supported platinum
(Pt)tin (Sn) catalysts have been widely used in naphtha
reforming or alkane dehydrogenation processes due to their
high selectivity and stability [7]. Different deposition techni-
ques used in the preparation of PtSn/Al2O3 catalysts lead to
different adsorbed species after impregnation [8,9]. The
deposition of [PtCl2(SnCl3)2]2complex on the alumina surface
with the strong interaction between Pt and Sn is generally
achieved by co-impregnation technique [10]. It is shown that the
addition of Sn to Pt has the following effects on dehydroge-
nation reaction:
i  Increases the catalyst stability and decrease the rate of
deactivation [11].
ii  Changes the selectivity by inhibiting hydrocracking,
oligomerization and coke formation on the catalyst surface
[3,12,13].
iii  The metallic crystallites show high degree of dispersion
and higher resistance to aging [11].
Supported tin may exist as Sn4+, Sn2+ and Sno, which cause the
complexity of the catalyst. Thedegree of the tin reduction has been
foundto depend onthetin loading,temperature of thepretreatment
and the presence of surface additives such as chlorine [14].
Generally, platinumtin alloys are obtained only upon reductive
treatments, in which a one-to-one atomic composition (PtSn) is

the most frequently detected by several techniques. However, all
types of platinumtin alloys are possible [15]. It has been
identified that five different stable alloys that can form between Pt
and Sn are PtSn, PtSn2, PtSn4, Pt2Sn3, and Pt3Sn [16]. Alloy
formation between Pt and Sn is thermodynamically favorable
and is expected when the metals are in sufficiently close prox-
imity for the tin oxide to accept spillover hydrogen from easily
reducible Pt. Indeed, PtSn alloy phases in addition to oxidic
tin states have been detected from in situ studies [17].
There are numerous factors that can affect the properties of
catalysts such as the acidity of the support, preparation pro-
cedure, nature of the precursor compounds, impregnation
sequence of metal loading, activation of the solid [1,18] and
dispersion of the active metallic species [19]. An example to
illustrate the influence of the preparation procedure can be found
in the work of Vertes et al. [20], who carried out a series of
mossbaura experiments over bimetallic PtSn/γ-Al2O3 catalysts
obtained by a reaction between Sn(C2H5)4 and Pt/γ-Al2O3 by an
impregnation of SnCl2 onto Pt/γ-Al2O3. In order to reduce the
acidity of the support, the γ-Al2O3 is generally poisoned by the
addition of alkali metal ions such as K or Li. The way in which
these promoters are added could influence the final properties,
not only of the support but also of the metallic phases [21].
For the dehydrogenation of alkanes, a great deal of work has
been done to provide better supports for noble metals. Spinel-
type structures, which have high thermal stability, low acidity
and hydrophobic behavior, are well adapted to the expected
conditions forced in dehydrogenation processes. Moreover, it
has been reported that spinels such as ZnA12O4 or MgA12O4
tend to prevent sintering of platinum due to a strong metal-
support interaction [15]. Nowadays, several studies are being
carried out to evaluate the modification of the stability,
selectivity and activity of the metallic catalysts by the addition
of some alkali metals such as Li, Ba, K and Ca in PtSn/Al2O3
catalyst. The incorporation of Sn and Li improved light-paraffin
dehydrogenation and inhibited isomerization and cracking
reactions [22]. The effect of K on Pt and PtSn supported on
silica, prepared by ion-exchange method, was studied by
Cortright et al. [23] for isobutane dehydrogenation. They found
that the addition of Sn and K diminished the size of the surface
platinum ensembles, suppressing the hydrogenolysis, isomeri-
zation and coking reactions. In KSnPt/SiO2 catalyst,
dehydrogenation rate increased either due to an increase in
the number of sites available for hydrogen removal from
adsorbed isobutane or to the stabilization of adsorbed isobutane
molecules by potassium.
In the present study, PtSn/γ-Al2O3, PtSnK/γ-Al2O3Al2-
O3 and PtSnLi/γ-Al2O3 catalysts were prepared. The
catalysts were characterized by temperature-programmed re-
duction (TPR) and X-ray diffraction (XRD) techniques. The
dehydrogenation of iC4 on the prepared catalysts was tested in a
continuous tubular fixed bed flow reactor. Initially, primary
experiments were tested to explore the suitable ranges for the
operating variables. Subsequently, the operating conditions
were optimized using Taguchi's algorithm with four operating
variables such as incorporation of K and Li as a promoter,
reaction temperature, feed flow rate (Q) and iC4/H2 ratio.
Effects of the addition of potassium and lithium as promoters on
physical and chemical properties, as well as on the catalytic
activity of PtSn/γ-Al2O3 catalyst in the dehydrogenation of
iC4 were also investigated.
2. Experimental
2.1. Preparation of catalysts
γ-Al2O3 used in this study was obtained from Sigma-Aldrich.
All the catalysts were prepared by co-impregnation method.
Before the impregnation step, the γ-Al2O3 support was calcinated
in air at 550 C for 3 h. The specific surface area of the γ-Al2O3
was 115 m2/g. Subsequently, the support was impregnated using
hydrochloric acid solution of H2(PtCl6)d 6H2O and SnCl2d 2H2O.
These catalysts were then impregnate with an aqueous solution of
K2CrO4 and LiOHd H2O which were used as the promoter agents
[24]. Pt loading was held constant at 1 wt.% [1,3,24] while Sn
loading was varied from 1 wt.% to 5 wt.% [25]. After the im-
pregnation step, the catalysts were dried at 120 C for 12 h,
followed by calcination in air for 2 h at 500 C [3]. The compo-
sitions of the prepared catalysts are presented in Table 1.
2.2. Catalyst characterization
Catalyst samples were characterized by temperature-
programmed reduction (TPR) and X-ray diffraction (XRD)
techniques. The bulk reduction behavior of each catalyst was
studied using a Micromeritics TPR/TPD 2900 system. 0.05 g of
calcined samples was initially heated under He flow (50 cm3/
min) at a rate of 10 C/min from room temperature to 200 C for
20 min. Then, the reducing gas (5% H2 in Ar) was switched on
at 20 cm3/min and the sample temperature was raised at 5 C/
min until it reached 900 C where it was held constant for
30 min. The effluent gas was passed through a cooling trap (at a
temperature of lower than 50 C) to condense and collect the
water generated during the reduction process. A thermal
conductivity detector (TCD) was used to determine the amount
of H2 consumed. XRD test was performed on the catalysts by
means of using Cu Kα radiation using a Philips PW 3710
powder diffractometer instrument.
2.3. Isobutane dehydrogenation reaction
Isobutane dehydrogenation reaction tests were performed in
a continuous tubular fixed bed flow reactor operated at
atmospheric pressure. The stainless steel reactor had an inside
diameter of 11 mm and was 1 m long. In order to reduce the
catalysts, they were charged into the reactor and the temperature

was raised to 400 C at a rate of 5 C/min under hydrogen (H2)
flow at 30 cm3/min as suggested by Sharma et al. [12]. This
condition was maintained for 2 h and the reactor was then fed
with a mixture of iC4 and H2 at iC4/ H2 ratio of 4: 1. The total
feed flow rate was 2575 cm3/min. On Pt-based catalysts, it
was sometimes necessary to add hydrogen to the feed to reduce
deactivation due to the coke formation on the catalyst [3].
The flow rates of the feed were regulated by means of mass
flow controllers (Brooks 5850E) and the iC4 and H2 were mixed
in a static mixer to ensure homogeneity. The reaction
temperature was varied from 550 C to 650 C [25]. The purity
of iC4 used was 98%. Approximately, 1.52.0 g catalyst was
charged into the reactor in each experimental run. The
composition of the feed and the gaseous products were analyzed
using an on-line gas chromatograph (Varian STAR 3400). A 1/
8 in. OD stainless steel column, 6 m in length, packed with 18 %
Sebaconitril/CPAW 60/80 and operated at 47 C was employed
in this work. The retention times of the gas components were
calibrated using appropriate standards.
2.4. Experimental design
The main objectives of this study were to optimize the
composition of PtSn catalyst and operating conditions in order
to gain higher isobutane conversion and isobutene selectivity.
Reaction temperature, feed flow rate (Q), iC4/H2 ratio and the
catalyst type were the main variables that were investigated.
Each variable was evaluated at 4 levels explored in a certain
suitable range based on results of preliminary experiments. A
total number of 256 experiments were necessary to be
performed in order to optimize these parameters. However,
Taguchi's algorithm which is standard software was employed
to design the experiments to reduce the number of experiment to
32. Consequently, 32 runs at 32 different combinations of
operating conditions were carried out.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Catalyst characterization
3.1.1. Temperature  programmed reduction
As can be seen in Fig. 1, all the catalysts showed a single
peak correspond to simultaneous reduction of Pt and Sn to
indicate the formation of alloys. The proximity between the Pt
and Sn species favored the formation of PtxSny alloys after the
reduction treatment that provided stability and selectivity for the
isobutane dehydrogenation. In Catalysts 1 through 4, the
maximum reduction temperatures occurred at 284, 282, 298 and
293 C, respectively. (The temperature of TPR was read by
drawing a vertical line from the peaks of the graph to the linear
line and the corresponding temperature is read from the
temperature axis). For Catalyst 3, the maximum reduction
temperature and hydrogen consumption were significantly
higher compared to the other catalysts. This was attributed to
the consequence of the addition of K as the promoter. Indeed,
the effect of K as the promoter was more pronounced than that
of Li on the reduction behavior of the catalysts. Therefore, it
could be concluded that K had significantly affected the
interaction between Pt and Sn and helped the formation of
PtxSny alloys.
The amount of Sn in Catalyst 2 is more than that in Catalyst
1. However, the maximum reduction peak and correspondingly
the hydrogen consumption in Catalyst 2 was less than that of
Catalyst 1. It suggested that H2 could not reduce all Sn atoms, as
the major portion of Sn was embedded within the metal cluster
and not fully accessible for reduction by hydrogen in catalyst 2.
By comparing between Catalyst 1 and Catalyst 3, it was noted
that by adding K as a promoter, increases the maximum
reduction temperature and hydrogen consumption. Actually, K

PtSn interactions were stronger in the Catalyst 3. The addition
of K in Catalyst 3 caused the reduction of higher amount of Sn2+
to Sn0 so the maximum reduction peak and the hydrogen
consumption were the highest. Also, Park et al. [26] discovered
through by CO TPD experiments that the addition of Sn and K
to Pt leads to a direct interaction between these three metals,
with the possible formation of a surface PtKSn alloy.
3.1.2. X-Ray diffraction
The phases in the catalysts and the diffraction pattern as
detected by X-ray diffraction tests are presented in Table 2 and
Fig. 2, respectively. The X-ray diffractogram of all catalysts in
Fig. 2 have been plotted on the same scale with the intensity axis
given in arbitrary unit (a.u) for a valid comparison between
different catalysts. Well defined peaks were observed, indicating
nonlinear crystalline amorphous structure of the catalysts. It was
found that the addition of K in Catalyst 3 notably changed the
structure of the catalyst as compared to Catalyst 1. However, the
effect of the addition of Li was not as severe as that addition of K.
3.2. Exploration for range of the factors under study
All the catalysts were first tested under the following
operating conditions; a temperature of 550 C (as proposed by
Demiguel et al. [8]), feed flow rate of 50 cm3/min and iC4/H2 of
1/3. The conversion of iC4 and selectivity toward isobutene for
all the catalysts are presented in Fig. 3 (a) and (b), respectively.
It can be seen that generally, the conversion of iC4 decreased
with time but the deactivation was very minimal for Catalyst 3
(Fig. 3 (a)). The selectivity toward isobutene increased until
about 80 min of reaction time after which, it decreased due to
the coke formation and side reactions. Since Catalyst 3 showed
almost the highest selectivity under the above operating
conditions, this catalyst was chosen for the subsequent tests.
Fig. 4 (a) and (b) respectively represent the conversion of iC4
and selectivity toward isobutene of Catalyst 3 at the operating
conditions as follows; feed flow rate of 50 cm3/min, iC4/H2
ratio of 1/3 and different reaction temperatures. In Fig. 4 (a), the
conversion of iC4 increased with the increase in temperature as
the reaction was endothermic. However by increasing the tem-
perature, the conversion decreased with reaction time while the
conversion became constant more rapidly. At 550 C, the con-
version was low. Fig. 4(b) shows that by increasing the tem-
perature of the reaction, the selectivity to isobutene decreased.
This observation was attributed to the increase in the production
of side products. At 650 C, the selectivity toward isobutene
was about 30% while at 550 C, the highest selectivity of about
85% was achieved. For all catalysts, selectivity initially
increased but after 80 min of reaction time, they showed a
gradual decrease in this process parameter.
In Fig. 5 (a) and (b), effects of feed rate on iC4 conversion
and isobutene selectivity at a temperature of 625 C, iC4/H2
ratio of 1/3, and different feed flow rates of 25, 50, 75 cm3/min
are shown. The conversion of iC4 decreased as the flow rate
increased due to the decrease contact time between catalyst and
feed. As evident in Fig. 5 (a), at 25 cm3/min, the conversion was
the highest and at flow rate of 75 cm3/min, the conversion was
the lowest. As noted in Fig. 5 (b), the maximum selectivity
could be achieved at a feed flow rate of 50 cm3/min. Both the

increase and decrease in the flow rate from 50 cm3/min caused a
decrease in the selectivity. This observation might result from an
increase in by-products formation at the flow rate of less than
50 cm3/min due to longer contact time. The selectivity decrease
at a flow rate of 75 cm3/min was attributed to the short contact
time to cause lower conversion.
In order to study the influence of the ratio of iC4 to H2 in the
feed flow, experiments were carried out at constant operating
conditions i.e. 50 cm3/min of feed flow rate, 625 C and iC4/H2
ratio of 1/3, 2/2 and 3/1. Fig. 6 (a) and (b) show the conversion
of iC4 and selectivity toward isobutene as function of time of
reaction for Catalyst 3 at different iC4/H2 ratios. It is noted in
Fig. 6 (a) that as the ratio of iC4/H2 was increased, the con-
version of iC4 also increased due to higher molar feed rate of iC4
although the conversion was the highest at iC4/H2 ratio of 3/1
while it was the lowest at iC4/H2 ratio of 1/3. By increasing the
ratio of iC4, the conversion increased partly because of the
formation of by-products like coke formation. While the
selectivity toward isobutene was also found to reduce due to

different flow rates, 625 C and iC4/H2 ratio of 1/3.

the same reason as suggested by Fig. 6 (b). Initially, the
selectivity increased until the reaction time reached about
80 min then it decreased. The selectivity was the highest at an
iC4/H2 ratio of 1/3 and it was the lowest at a ratio of 3/1. It
indicated that by increasing iC4/H2 ratio, the production of by-
products like coke formation increased accordingly. So it was
necessary to increase amount of hydrogen to the feed to reduce
deactivation due to the coke formation on the catalyst. This
condition was also suggested by Baronetti et al. [9].
3.3. Process optimization
After all catalysts were tested under wide ranges of operating
conditions, we could identify the suitable ranges for reaction
temperature, feed flow rate and iC4/H2 ratio. Thus, all catalysts
were next tested according condition given in Tables 3 and 4
which were designed by Taguchi's algorithm for gain higher
conversion of isobutane and selectivity toward isobutene. As
noted in Fig. 7 (a) the conversion of iC4 increased with an increase
in the reaction temperature. The conversion was very low at
temperatures below 525 C while it increased to 70% by in-
creasing the temperature to 600 C. The selectivity to isobutene
decreased with an increase in the temperature. It was further
shown in Fig. 7 (b) that the selectivity to isobutene increased to
about 55% when the temperature was increased from 525 to
550 C while it reduced to about 20% as temperature was further
increased from 550 to 600 C. This could be attributed to the
Fig. 7. (a) Conversion and (b) selectivity as function of time at different
temperatures.

shifting of reaction toward the formation of coke and some by
products.
Increasing feed flow rate had a negative effect on the
conversion. It caused about 25% decrease in conversion when
the flow rate was increased from 40 cm3/min to 70 cm3/min
(Fig. 8 (a)). The conversion was the highest at a feed flow rate of
70 cm3/min and it was the lowest at 40 cm3/min. However, it
showed contradictory effect on the selectivity to isobutene. As
shown in Fig. 8 (b), the selectivity to isobutene increased when
the feed flow rate was increased from 40 cm3/min to 50 cm3/
min. However, it decreased by further rise in the feed rate to
70 cm3/min. The maximum selectivity was achieved at a flow
rate of 50 cm3/min.
The final operating variable i. e. the ratio of iC4/H2 was varied
between 1:4 and 4:4. As noted in Fig. 9 (a), the conversion
increased by an increase in the ratio of iC4/H2. For example, an
increase in the ratio from 1:4 to 4:4 resulted in approximately
40% increase in the conversion. It could be concluded that by
increasing this ratio, the production of by products increased. On
the other hand, as shown in Fig. 9 (b), the selectivity to isobutene
decreased by an increase in this ratio. In fact, as the by-products
formation increased with an increase the ratio, the selectivity to
isobutene decreased.
4. Conclusions
The presence of both K and Li in the catalysts resulted in
higher activity and stability of the catalyst for the dehydroge-
nation of iC4 to isobutene. The amount of PtxSny alloy and the
percentage of Sn reduced to the metallic state were higher in
those PtSn/γ-Al2O3 catalysts, in which, higher quantities of
[PtCl2 (SnCl3)2]2complex were formed during the impregna-
tion. The results suggested the existence of a relationship
between the amount of [PtCl2(SnCl3)2]2complex deposited on
the alumina after the impregnation step, tin reducibility and PtSn
alloy formation [7]. PtSnK supported catalyst used in this
study showed higher selectivity than PtSnLi. Its remarkable
performance for the dehydrogenation of iC4 was associated with
the structural and electronic properties. Suitable and sufficient
weight percentage of Sn and the use of K as the promoter for
reducing undesired production and acidity of the support caused
the highest selectivity to isobutene. The addition of K resulted in
better selectivity toward isobutene. It was observed that alkali
and alkaline earth metals are basic in character and could sup-
press the strong acidity responsible for the reaction chain to
propagate further from isobutene such as cracking, oligomeri-
zation, cyclization and coke formation. Catalyst 3 showed the
best catalytic performance. The best operating conditions for the
highest selectivity toward isobutene production were as follows:
a reaction temperature of 550 C, feed flow rate of 50 cm3/min
and iC4/H2 ratio of 1/3.
