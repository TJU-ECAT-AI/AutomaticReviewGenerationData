[1] "Typically, Pt- or Cr-based catalysts are used in commercial dehydrogenation plants."

[2] "PtSn bimetallic catalysts show the above mentioned characteristics, to some extent, more than the corresponding monometallic Pt catalysts"

[3] "Catalyst with smaller particles (3 nm) is much more active and less selective than that with larger particles (21 nm). Rate of coking, selectivity to coke formation and the amount of coke formed are significantly higher over the former than that on the latter."

[4] "For the first time, we report that monometallic Pt-SBA-15 catalyst which contains smaller particles is much more active but less selective in DHP than catalyst with larger particles."

The literature does not provide comprehensive information to fully compare and contrast noble metal-based catalysts (particularly Platinum) with metal oxide-based catalysts for light olefin dehydrogenation. However, based on the limited information available:

Composition: The study focuses on monometallic Pt catalysts supported on SBA-15. It also mentions PtSn bimetallic catalysts and Cr-based catalysts, but does not discuss metal oxide catalysts like gallium, indium, vanadium, zinc, or molybdenum oxides.

Effectiveness: Platinum-based catalysts are shown to be effective for propane dehydrogenation. The effectiveness depends on particle size, with smaller Pt particles (3 nm) being more active but less selective than larger particles (21 nm). 

Industrial applications: The text states that Pt- or Cr-based catalysts are typically used in commercial dehydrogenation plants.

Recent developments: The study presents new findings on the effect of Pt particle size on catalytic performance in propane dehydrogenation. It shows that smaller Pt particles are more active but less selective, and prone to higher coking rates.

The literature does not provide information to compare the potential advantages of Pt-based catalysts versus metal oxide catalysts. More comprehensive research would be needed to fully address the question.

该文献没有提供全面的信息来完整比较和对比贵金属基催化剂(特别是铂)与金属氧化物基催化剂在轻烯烃脱氢方面的性能。但根据有限的可用信息:

组成:该研究主要关注负载在SBA-15上的单金属Pt催化剂。它还提到了PtSn双金属催化剂和基于Cr的催化剂,但没有讨论镓、铟、钒、锌或钼等金属氧化物催化剂。

有效性:铂基催化剂被证明对丙烷脱氢有效。其效果取决于粒子尺寸,较小的Pt粒子(3 nm)活性更高但选择性较低,而较大的粒子(21 nm)则相反。

工业应用:文中指出,Pt或Cr基催化剂通常用于商业脱氢工厂。

最新进展:该研究提出了Pt粒子尺寸对丙烷脱氢催化性能影响的新发现。结果表明,较小的Pt粒子活性更高但选择性较低,且更容易产生积碳。

文献没有提供比较Pt基催化剂与金属氧化物催化剂潜在优势的信息。需要更全面的研究才能完整回答这个问题。
