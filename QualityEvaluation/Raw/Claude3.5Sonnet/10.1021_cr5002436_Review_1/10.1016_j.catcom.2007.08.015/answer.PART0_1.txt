[1] "Typically, Pt- or Cr-based catalysts are used in commercial dehydrogenation plants."

[2] "PtSn bimetallic catalysts show the above mentioned characteristics, to some extent, more than the corresponding monometallic Pt catalysts"

[3] "This work exclusively evaluates the effect of Pt particle size on the activity, selectivity and the degree of coking."

[4] "For the first time, we report that monometallic Pt-SBA-15 catalyst which contains smaller particles is much more active but less selective in DHP than catalyst with larger particles."

The literature primarily focuses on platinum-based catalysts for propane dehydrogenation, particularly monometallic Pt-SBA-15 catalysts. It does not provide comprehensive information about metal oxide-based catalysts like CrOx, gallium, indium, vanadium, zinc, and molybdenum oxides.

The document mentions that both Pt- and Cr-based catalysts are used in commercial dehydrogenation plants. It highlights that PtSn bimetallic catalysts show improved characteristics compared to monometallic Pt catalysts.

The study specifically investigates the effect of Pt particle size on catalyst performance. It found that smaller Pt particles (3 nm) are more active but less selective for propane dehydrogenation compared to larger particles (21 nm). Smaller particles also lead to higher rates of coking and coke formation.

The literature does not provide information about the compositions, effectiveness, industrial applications, or recent developments of metal oxide-based catalysts. It also does not compare the potential advantages of noble metal-based catalysts versus metal oxide-based catalysts in the field of light olefin dehydrogenation.

To fully answer the question, additional information from other sources would be required to discuss and compare metal oxide-based catalysts with the platinum-based catalysts described in this document.

该文献主要关注丙烷脱氢反应中的铂基催化剂，特别是单金属Pt-SBA-15催化剂。它没有提供关于金属氧化物基催化剂（如CrOx、镓、铟、钒、锌和钼氧化物）的全面信息。

文件提到铂基和铬基催化剂都用于商业脱氢工厂。它强调PtSn双金属催化剂比单金属Pt催化剂表现出更好的特性。

该研究专门调查了Pt粒子尺寸对催化剂性能的影响。研究发现，较小的Pt粒子（3纳米）在丙烷脱氢反应中活性更高但选择性较低，相比之下较大的粒子（21纳米）则表现相反。较小的粒子还导致更高的积碳率和积碳形成。

该文献没有提供有关金属氧化物基催化剂的成分、有效性、工业应用或最新发展的信息。它也没有比较贵金属基催化剂与金属氧化物基催化剂在轻烯烃脱氢领域的潜在优势。

要全面回答这个问题，需要从其他来源获取额外信息，以讨论和比较金属氧化物基催化剂与本文所述的铂基催化剂。
