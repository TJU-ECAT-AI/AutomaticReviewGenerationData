[1] "Typically, Pt- or Cr-based catalysts are used in commercial dehydrogenation plants."

[2] "PtSn bimetallic catalysts show the above mentioned characteristics, to some extent, more than the corresponding monometallic Pt catalysts"

[3] "Catalyst with smaller particles (3 nm) is much more active and less selective than that with larger particles (21 nm). Rate of coking, selectivity to coke formation and the amount of coke formed are significantly higher over the former than that on the latter."

[4] "This work exclusively evaluates the effect of Pt particle size on the activity, selectivity and the degree of coking."

<EnglishVersionAnswer>

The literature provided focuses primarily on platinum-based catalysts for propane dehydrogenation, with limited information on metal oxide-based catalysts. However, some comparisons can be made:

Composition: Platinum-based catalysts are typically monometallic Pt or bimetallic PtSn supported on materials like SBA-15. The only metal oxide mentioned is Cr-based catalysts.

Effectiveness: Pt-based catalysts show high activity but face challenges with selectivity and coking. Smaller Pt particles (3 nm) are more active but less selective than larger particles (21 nm). PtSn bimetallic catalysts show improved characteristics compared to monometallic Pt catalysts.

Industrial applications: Both Pt- and Cr-based catalysts are used in commercial dehydrogenation plants.

Recent developments: The study focuses on the effect of Pt particle size on catalyst performance, showing that particle size significantly influences activity, selectivity, and coking behavior.

The literature does not provide information on gallium, indium, vanadium, zinc, or molybdenum oxide catalysts, nor does it discuss their potential advantages compared to Pt-based catalysts. To fully answer the question, additional information on metal oxide-based catalysts would be needed.

<ChineseVersionAnswer>

所提供的文献主要集中在用于丙烷脱氢的铂基催化剂，对金属氧化物基催化剂的信息有限。然而，可以进行一些比较：

成分：铂基催化剂通常是单金属Pt或双金属PtSn，负载在SBA-15等材料上。唯一提到的金属氧化物是Cr基催化剂。

有效性：Pt基催化剂显示出高活性，但在选择性和结焦方面面临挑战。较小的Pt颗粒（3 nm）比较大的颗粒（21 nm）活性更高但选择性更低。PtSn双金属催化剂与单金属Pt催化剂相比表现出更好的特性。

工业应用：Pt和Cr基催化剂都用于商业脱氢工厂。

最新发展：该研究重点关注Pt颗粒大小对催化剂性能的影响，表明颗粒大小显著影响活性、选择性和结焦行为。

文献没有提供关于镓、铟、钒、锌或钼氧化物催化剂的信息，也没有讨论它们与Pt基催化剂相比的潜在优势。要全面回答这个问题，还需要有关金属氧化物基催化剂的额外信息。

The document mentions that both Pt- and Cr-based catalysts are used in commercial dehydrogenation plants. It highlights that PtSn bimetallic catalysts show improved characteristics compared to monometallic Pt catalysts.

The study specifically investigates the effect of Pt particle size on catalyst performance. It found that smaller Pt particles (3 nm) are more active but less selective for propane dehydrogenation compared to larger particles (21 nm). Smaller particles also lead to higher rates of coking and coke formation.

The literature does not provide information about the compositions, effectiveness, industrial applications, or recent developments of metal oxide-based catalysts. It also does not compare the potential advantages of noble metal-based catalysts versus metal oxide-based catalysts in the field of light olefin dehydrogenation.

To fully answer the question, additional information from other sources would be required to discuss and compare metal oxide-based catalysts with the platinum-based catalysts described in this document.

The literature does not provide comprehensive information to fully compare and contrast noble metal-based catalysts (particularly Platinum) with metal oxide-based catalysts for light olefin dehydrogenation. However, based on the limited information available:

Composition: The study focuses on monometallic Pt catalysts supported on SBA-15. It also mentions PtSn bimetallic catalysts and Cr-based catalysts, but does not discuss metal oxide catalysts like gallium, indium, vanadium, zinc, or molybdenum oxides.

Effectiveness: Platinum-based catalysts are shown to be effective for propane dehydrogenation. The effectiveness depends on particle size, with smaller Pt particles (3 nm) being more active but less selective than larger particles (21 nm). 

Industrial applications: The text states that Pt- or Cr-based catalysts are typically used in commercial dehydrogenation plants.

Recent developments: The study presents new findings on the effect of Pt particle size on catalytic performance in propane dehydrogenation. It shows that smaller Pt particles are more active but less selective, and prone to higher coking rates.

The literature does not provide information to compare the potential advantages of Pt-based catalysts versus metal oxide catalysts. More comprehensive research would be needed to fully address the question.

The literature primarily focuses on platinum-based catalysts for propane dehydrogenation, with limited information on other metal oxide catalysts. It mentions that both Pt and Cr-based catalysts are used commercially. The study specifically examines Pt-SBA-15 catalysts, finding that smaller Pt particles are more active but less selective than larger particles for propane dehydrogenation. PtSn bimetallic catalysts are noted to have some advantages over monometallic Pt catalysts.

The document does not provide information to compare Pt catalysts with other metal oxide catalysts like gallium, indium, vanadium, zinc, and molybdenum oxides. It also lacks details on the industrial applications, recent developments, and potential advantages of these other catalysts in light olefin dehydrogenation.

The literature primarily focuses on platinum-based catalysts for propane dehydrogenation, with only brief mentions of chromium-based catalysts. It does not provide information on other metal oxide catalysts like gallium, indium, vanadium, zinc, or molybdenum oxides.

For platinum catalysts, the document discusses the effects of particle size on catalyst performance. Smaller Pt particles (around 3 nm) are found to be more active but less selective for propylene production compared to larger particles (around 21 nm). The smaller particles also lead to higher rates of coking and coke formation.

The literature mentions that PtSn bimetallic catalysts show improved characteristics compared to monometallic Pt catalysts, but does not elaborate on the specifics.

Regarding industrial applications, the document only states that Pt- or Cr-based catalysts are typically used in commercial dehydrogenation plants.

The literature does not provide information on recent developments or potential advantages of different catalyst types in the field of light olefin dehydrogenation. The focus is primarily on studying the effect of Pt particle size on catalyst performance for propane dehydrogenation.

Given the limited scope of the provided literature, a comprehensive comparison of noble metal-based and metal oxide-based catalysts for light olefin dehydrogenation cannot be made based solely on this information.
