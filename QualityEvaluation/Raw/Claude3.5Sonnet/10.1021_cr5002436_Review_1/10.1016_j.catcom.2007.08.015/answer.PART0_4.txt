The literature primarily focuses on platinum-based catalysts for propane dehydrogenation, with only brief mentions of chromium-based catalysts. It does not provide information on other metal oxide catalysts like gallium, indium, vanadium, zinc, or molybdenum oxides.

For platinum catalysts, the document discusses the effects of particle size on catalyst performance. Smaller Pt particles (around 3 nm) are found to be more active but less selective for propylene production compared to larger particles (around 21 nm). The smaller particles also lead to higher rates of coking and coke formation.

The literature mentions that PtSn bimetallic catalysts show improved characteristics compared to monometallic Pt catalysts, but does not elaborate on the specifics.

Regarding industrial applications, the document only states that Pt- or Cr-based catalysts are typically used in commercial dehydrogenation plants.

The literature does not provide information on recent developments or potential advantages of different catalyst types in the field of light olefin dehydrogenation. The focus is primarily on studying the effect of Pt particle size on catalyst performance for propane dehydrogenation.

Given the limited scope of the provided literature, a comprehensive comparison of noble metal-based and metal oxide-based catalysts for light olefin dehydrogenation cannot be made based solely on this information.

这篇文献主要关注于丙烷脱氢反应中使用的铂基催化剂,仅简单提及了铬基催化剂。文中没有提供关于其他金属氧化物催化剂(如镓、铟、钒、锌或钼氧化物)的信息。

对于铂催化剂,文献讨论了粒子尺寸对催化剂性能的影响。研究发现,较小的铂粒子(约3纳米)比较大的粒子(约21纳米)活性更高,但对丙烯的选择性更低。较小的粒子还导致更高的结焦速率和焦炭形成。

文献提到PtSn双金属催化剂比单金属Pt催化剂表现出更好的特性,但没有详细说明具体情况。

关于工业应用,文献只提到在商业脱氢工厂中通常使用铂基或铬基催化剂。

文献没有提供轻烯烃脱氢领域不同类型催化剂的最新发展或潜在优势的信息。研究重点主要是铂粒子尺寸对丙烷脱氢催化剂性能的影响。

鉴于所提供文献的范围有限,仅基于这些信息无法对贵金属基和金属氧化物基催化剂在轻烯烃脱氢方面进行全面比较。
