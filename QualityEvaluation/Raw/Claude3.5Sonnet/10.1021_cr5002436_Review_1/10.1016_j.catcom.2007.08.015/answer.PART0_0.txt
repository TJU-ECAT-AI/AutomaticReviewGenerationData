[1] "Typically, Pt- or Cr-based catalysts are used in commercial dehydrogenation plants."

[2] "PtSn bimetallic catalysts show the above mentioned characteristics, to some extent, more than the corresponding monometallic Pt catalysts"

[3] "Catalyst with smaller particles (3 nm) is much more active and less selective than that with larger particles (21 nm). Rate of coking, selectivity to coke formation and the amount of coke formed are significantly higher over the former than that on the latter."

[4] "This work exclusively evaluates the effect of Pt particle size on the activity, selectivity and the degree of coking."

The literature provided focuses primarily on platinum-based catalysts for propane dehydrogenation, with limited information on metal oxide-based catalysts. However, some comparisons can be made:

Composition: Platinum-based catalysts are typically monometallic Pt or bimetallic PtSn supported on materials like SBA-15. The only metal oxide mentioned is Cr-based catalysts.

Effectiveness: Pt-based catalysts show high activity but face challenges with selectivity and coking. Smaller Pt particles (3 nm) are more active but less selective than larger particles (21 nm). PtSn bimetallic catalysts show improved characteristics compared to monometallic Pt catalysts.

Industrial applications: Both Pt- and Cr-based catalysts are used in commercial dehydrogenation plants.

Recent developments: The study focuses on the effect of Pt particle size on catalyst performance, showing that particle size significantly influences activity, selectivity, and coking behavior.

The literature does not provide information on gallium, indium, vanadium, zinc, or molybdenum oxide catalysts, nor does it discuss their potential advantages compared to Pt-based catalysts. To fully answer the question, additional information on metal oxide-based catalysts would be needed.

所提供的文献主要集中在用于丙烷脱氢的铂基催化剂，对金属氧化物基催化剂的信息有限。然而，可以进行一些比较：

成分：铂基催化剂通常是单金属Pt或双金属PtSn，负载在SBA-15等材料上。唯一提到的金属氧化物是Cr基催化剂。

有效性：Pt基催化剂显示出高活性，但在选择性和结焦方面面临挑战。较小的Pt颗粒（3 nm）比较大的颗粒（21 nm）活性更高但选择性更低。PtSn双金属催化剂与单金属Pt催化剂相比表现出更好的特性。

工业应用：Pt和Cr基催化剂都用于商业脱氢工厂。

最新发展：该研究重点关注Pt颗粒大小对催化剂性能的影响，表明颗粒大小显著影响活性、选择性和结焦行为。

文献没有提供关于镓、铟、钒、锌或钼氧化物催化剂的信息，也没有讨论它们与Pt基催化剂相比的潜在优势。要全面回答这个问题，还需要有关金属氧化物基催化剂的额外信息。
