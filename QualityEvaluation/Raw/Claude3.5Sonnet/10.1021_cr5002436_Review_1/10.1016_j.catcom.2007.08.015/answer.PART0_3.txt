[1] "Typically, Pt- or Cr-based catalysts are used in commercial dehydrogenation plants."

[2] "An example of this kind, PtSn bimetallic catalysts show the above mentioned characteristics, to some extent, more than the corresponding monometallic Pt catalysts"

[3] "For the first time, we report that monometallic Pt-SBA-15 catalyst which contains smaller particles is much more active but less selective in DHP than catalyst with larger particles."

The literature primarily focuses on platinum-based catalysts for propane dehydrogenation, with limited information on other metal oxide catalysts. It mentions that both Pt and Cr-based catalysts are used commercially. The study specifically examines Pt-SBA-15 catalysts, finding that smaller Pt particles are more active but less selective than larger particles for propane dehydrogenation. PtSn bimetallic catalysts are noted to have some advantages over monometallic Pt catalysts.

The document does not provide information to compare Pt catalysts with other metal oxide catalysts like gallium, indium, vanadium, zinc, and molybdenum oxides. It also lacks details on the industrial applications, recent developments, and potential advantages of these other catalysts in light olefin dehydrogenation.

To fully answer the question, additional information beyond what is provided in this specific literature would be required to compare and contrast noble metal-based catalysts with various metal oxide-based catalysts for light olefin dehydrogenation.

该文献主要关注烷烃脱氢反应中的铂基催化剂,对其他金属氧化物催化剂的信息有限。文中提到,铂和铬基催化剂在商业上都有应用。这项研究特别考察了Pt-SBA-15催化剂,发现较小的铂颗粒在丙烷脱氢反应中活性更高但选择性较低。文中还提到PtSn双金属催化剂相比单金属Pt催化剂具有一些优势。

该文献没有提供将铂催化剂与其他金属氧化物催化剂(如镓、铟、钒、锌和钼氧化物)进行比较的信息。它也缺乏这些其他催化剂在轻烯烃脱氢中的工业应用、最新发展和潜在优势的详细信息。

要全面回答这个问题,需要超出本文献所提供的额外信息,以比较和对比贵金属基催化剂与各种金属氧化物基催化剂在轻烯烃脱氢反应中的表现。
