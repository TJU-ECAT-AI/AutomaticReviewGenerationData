[1] "Platinum is the most effective transition metal for promoting alkane dehydrogenation; however, in order to achieve high alkene selectivity, it must be promoted with an element, such as Sn, Zn, Ge, Ga, or In, which interacts with the Pt to form a bimetallic alloy"

[2] "Recent work has shown that calcined hydrotalcite-like materials, referred to as Mg(Al)O, are ideal for this purpose"

[3] "PtIn catalysts have also been found to be more homogenous in composition than PtSn particles and to be stable for dehydrogenation of C4 and C5 alkanes"

[4] "We have recently reported a novel approach for producing PtGa bimetallic nanoparticles exhibiting high activity and selectivity for ethane and propane dehydrogenation, as well as reduced carbon deposition"

[5] "Analysis of EXAFS data indicates that the PtIn alloy formed contains only 12% In. This suggests that it is not necessary to form a stoichiometric alloy phase such as Pt3In, which contains 25% In, in order to have a strong effect on catalytic properties of Pt."

The literature primarily focuses on platinum-based catalysts for light olefin dehydrogenation, with limited information on metal oxide-based catalysts. However, some comparisons and contrasts can be drawn:

Composition: Noble metal catalysts typically consist of platinum promoted with elements like Sn, Zn, Ge, Ga, or In to form bimetallic alloys. The support is often a calcined hydrotalcite-like material such as Mg(Al)O. Metal oxide catalysts are not extensively discussed in this literature.

Effectiveness: Platinum-based catalysts, especially when promoted, show high activity and selectivity for alkane dehydrogenation. PtIn catalysts demonstrate higher homogeneity and stability compared to PtSn for C4 and C5 alkane dehydrogenation. 

Recent developments: A novel approach using PtGa bimetallic nanoparticles has shown high activity and selectivity for ethane and propane dehydrogenation, with reduced carbon deposition. PtIn alloys with as little as 12% In content can significantly affect Pt's catalytic properties.

Potential advantages: Promoted Pt catalysts offer high selectivity, reduced carbon deposition, and improved stability. The ability to tune catalyst properties with small amounts of promoter (e.g., 12% In) allows for efficient use of materials.

Industrial applications and comparisons with metal oxide catalysts are not directly addressed in the given literature.

该文献主要关注了用于轻烯烃脱氢的铂基催化剂，对金属氧化物基催化剂的信息有限。但是可以得出一些比较和对比：

组成：贵金属催化剂通常由铂和锡、锌、锗、镓或铟等元素促进形成双金属合金。载体通常是类水滑石材料如Mg(Al)O。本文献中未广泛讨论金属氧化物催化剂。

有效性：铂基催化剂，特别是经促进后，表现出高活性和选择性的烷烃脱氢性能。与PtSn相比，PtIn催化剂在C4和C5烷烃脱氢中表现出更高的均匀性和稳定性。

最新发展：使用PtGa双金属纳米粒子的新方法显示了高活性和选择性的乙烷和丙烷脱氢性能，并减少了碳沉积。含有仅12%铟的PtIn合金就能显著影响铂的催化性能。

潜在优势：经促进的Pt催化剂提供高选择性、减少碳沉积和改善稳定性。能够用少量促进剂（如12%的In）调节催化剂性能，允许材料的高效利用。

该文献没有直接讨论工业应用和与金属氧化物催化剂的比较。
