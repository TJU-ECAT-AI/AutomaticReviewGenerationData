[1] "Platinum is the most effective transition metal for promoting alkane dehydrogenation; however, in order to achieve high alkene selectivity, it must be promoted with an element, such as Sn, Zn, Ge, Ga, or In, which interacts with the Pt to form a bimetallic alloy"

[2] "Of the promoting elements listed earlier, the greatest attention has been given to Sn"

[3] "PtIn catalysts have also been found to be more homogenous in composition than PtSn particles and to be stable for dehydrogenation of C4 and C5 alkanes"

[4] "Catalysts for the dehydrogenation of light alkanes were prepared by dispersing Pt on the surface of a calcined hydrotalcite-like support containing indium, Mg(In)(Al)O."

[5] "The activity and selectivity of the Pt/Mg(In)(Al)O catalysts for ethane and propane dehydrogenation reactions are strongly dependent on the bulk In/Pt ratio. For both reactants, maximum activity was achieved for a bulk In/Pt ratio of 0.48, and at this In/Pt ratio, the selectivity to alkene was nearly 100%."

The literature focuses primarily on noble metal-based catalysts, particularly platinum, for the nonoxidative dehydrogenation of light olefins. It does not provide a direct comparison with metal oxide-based catalysts like CrOx, gallium, indium, vanadium, zinc, and molybdenum oxides.

Composition: The catalysts discussed are primarily platinum-based, promoted with elements like Sn, Zn, Ge, Ga, or In to form bimetallic alloys. The study focuses on Pt/Mg(In)(Al)O catalysts, where platinum is dispersed on a calcined hydrotalcite-like support containing indium.

Effectiveness: Platinum is described as the most effective transition metal for alkane dehydrogenation. The addition of promoter elements, particularly indium in this study, significantly improves alkene selectivity. The Pt/Mg(In)(Al)O catalysts achieved nearly 100% selectivity to alkenes at an optimal In/Pt ratio of 0.48.

Industrial applications: While not explicitly discussed, the focus on light alkane (ethane and propane) dehydrogenation suggests potential applications in the production of ethylene and propylene, which are important industrial feedstocks.

Recent developments: The study presents a novel approach using Pt/Mg(In)(Al)O catalysts, demonstrating high activity and selectivity for ethane and propane dehydrogenation. PtIn catalysts are noted to be more homogeneous in composition than PtSn catalysts and stable for dehydrogenation of C4 and C5 alkanes.

Potential advantages: The Pt/Mg(In)(Al)O catalysts show high selectivity, good activity, and improved stability compared to non-promoted platinum catalysts. The ability to tune the catalyst performance by adjusting the In/Pt ratio offers flexibility in optimizing the catalyst for specific applications.

The literature does not provide information on metal oxide-based catalysts for comparison.

这篇文献主要关注贵金属基催化剂，特别是铂，用于轻质烯烃的非氧化脱氢。它没有直接与金属氧化物基催化剂（如CrOx、镓、铟、钒、锌和钼氧化物）进行比较。

组成：讨论的催化剂主要是以铂为基础，通过添加Sn、Zn、Ge、Ga或In等元素来形成双金属合金。研究重点是Pt/Mg(In)(Al)O催化剂，其中铂分散在含铟的焙烧类水滑石支撑体上。

有效性：铂被描述为最有效的烷烃脱氢过渡金属。添加促进元素，特别是本研究中的铟，显著提高了烯烃选择性。Pt/Mg(In)(Al)O催化剂在最佳In/Pt比为0.48时，烯烃选择性接近100%。

工业应用：虽然没有明确讨论，但对轻烷烃（乙烷和丙烷）脱氢的关注表明其在乙烯和丙烯生产中的潜在应用，这些是重要的工业原料。

最新发展：该研究提出了使用Pt/Mg(In)(Al)O催化剂的新方法，展示了乙烷和丙烷脱氢的高活性和选择性。PtIn催化剂被认为比PtSn催化剂具有更均匀的组成，并且在C4和C5烷烃脱氢方面稳定。

潜在优势：Pt/Mg(In)(Al)O催化剂显示出高选择性、良好的活性和比未促进的铂催化剂更好的稳定性。通过调整In/Pt比例来调节催化剂性能的能力为特定应用的催化剂优化提供了灵活性。

文献没有提供金属氧化物基催化剂的对比信息。
