[1] "Platinum is the most effective transition metal for promoting alkane dehydrogenation; however, in order to achieve high alkene selectivity, it must be promoted with an element, such as Sn, Zn, Ge, Ga, or In, which interacts with the Pt to form a bimetallic alloy"

[2] "Bimetallic nanoparticles of Pt and the alloying element have also been found to produce less coke [1014], a product that can contribute to deactivation of the catalyst."

[3] "Recent work has shown that calcined hydrotalcite-like materials, referred to as Mg(Al)O, are ideal for this purpose [11,20,21]. Moreover, the Al cations present at the support surface help stabilize the dispersed metal particles against sintering [22]."

[4] "We have recently reported a novel approach for producing PtGa bimetallic nanoparticles exhibiting high activity and selectivity for ethane and propane dehydrogenation, as well as reduced carbon deposition [32]. These catalysts were prepared by dispersing Pt nanoparticles onto a calcined hydrotalcite-like support containing Ga, Mg(Ga)(Al)O."

[5] "Here we report on the preparation, characterization, and evaluation of such catalysts for ethane and propane dehydrogenation. XANES and EXAFS were used to track the alloy composition of the catalyst as a function of the bulk In/Pt ratio and examine the effect of reduction temperature on alloy formation."

The literature primarily focuses on noble metal-based catalysts, particularly platinum, for the nonoxidative dehydrogenation of light olefins. It does not directly compare these with metal oxide-based catalysts like CrOx, gallium, indium, vanadium, zinc, and molybdenum oxides.

For platinum-based catalysts:

Composition: Platinum is typically promoted with elements like Sn, Zn, Ge, Ga, or In to form bimetallic alloys. The catalyst is often supported on calcined hydrotalcite-like materials such as Mg(Al)O.

Effectiveness: Platinum is described as the most effective transition metal for alkane dehydrogenation. The bimetallic alloys show high activity and selectivity for ethane and propane dehydrogenation.

Recent developments: The study presents a novel approach using PtIn bimetallic nanoparticles supported on Mg(In)(Al)O for light alkane dehydrogenation. This catalyst showed improved performance compared to other Pt-based catalysts.

Advantages: The bimetallic nanoparticles produce less coke, which helps prevent catalyst deactivation. The calcined hydrotalcite-like supports help stabilize the dispersed metal particles against sintering.

The literature does not provide information on industrial applications or detailed comparisons with metal oxide-based catalysts for this specific reaction.

该文献主要关注贵金属基催化剂，特别是铂，用于轻质烯烃的非氧化脱氢。它没有直接与金属氧化物基催化剂（如CrOx、镓、铟、钒、锌和钼氧化物）进行比较。

对于铂基催化剂：

成分：铂通常与Sn、Zn、Ge、Ga或In等元素结合形成双金属合金。催化剂经常负载在类水滑石材料如Mg(Al)O上。

有效性：铂被描述为烷烃脱氢最有效的过渡金属。双金属合金对乙烷和丙烷脱氢表现出高活性和选择性。

最新发展：该研究提出了一种新方法，使用负载在Mg(In)(Al)O上的PtIn双金属纳米粒子进行轻质烷烃脱氢。这种催化剂相比其他铂基催化剂表现出更好的性能。

优势：双金属纳米粒子产生的积碳较少，有助于防止催化剂失活。类水滑石支持材料有助于稳定分散的金属粒子，防止烧结。

该文献没有提供关于工业应用或与金属氧化物基催化剂在这一特定反应中的详细比较信息。
