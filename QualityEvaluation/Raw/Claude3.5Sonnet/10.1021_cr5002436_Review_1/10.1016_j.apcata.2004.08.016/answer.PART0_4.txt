[1] "Bimetallic catalysts supported on ZnAl2O4 and MgAl2O4 have been found to be active and selective for the direct dehydrogenation of light paraffins."

[2] "The Sn addition to Pt/ZnAl2O4 and Pt/MgAl2O4 leads to an increase of the activity in n-butane dehydrogenation, and to high selectivity values to all butenes (1-butene, cis- and trans-2-butenes, and 1,3-butadiene)."

[3] "PtSn catalysts supported on ZnAl2O4 and MgAl2O4 show good catalytic stability levels after five reaction-regeneration cycles, though the stability of the PtSn/MgAl2O4 catalyst was clearly higher than for the PtSn/ZnAl2O4 one."

The literature focuses primarily on platinum-based catalysts, particularly PtSn bimetallic catalysts supported on ZnAl2O4 and MgAl2O4, for the nonoxidative dehydrogenation of light paraffins. These catalysts show high activity, selectivity, and stability for dehydrogenation reactions.

The document does not provide information on metal oxide-based catalysts such as CrOx, gallium, indium, vanadium, zinc, and molybdenum oxides. Therefore, a direct comparison between noble metal-based and metal oxide-based catalysts cannot be made based solely on this literature.

For platinum-based catalysts:

Composition: PtSn bimetallic catalysts supported on ZnAl2O4 and MgAl2O4
Effectiveness: High activity and selectivity for n-butane dehydrogenation
Industrial applications: Direct dehydrogenation of light paraffins
Recent developments: Addition of Sn to Pt catalysts improves activity, selectivity, and stability
Potential advantages: Good catalytic stability over multiple reaction-regeneration cycles

Without information on metal oxide-based catalysts, a comprehensive comparison cannot be made. Additional research would be needed to fully address the question and compare these different catalyst types.

该文献主要关注铂基催化剂，特别是以ZnAl2O4和MgAl2O4为载体的PtSn双金属催化剂，用于轻质烷烃的非氧化脱氢。这些催化剂在脱氢反应中表现出高活性、高选择性和高稳定性。

文献没有提供关于CrOx、镓、铟、钒、锌和钼氧化物等金属氧化物基催化剂的信息。因此，仅基于这篇文献无法直接比较贵金属基催化剂和金属氧化物基催化剂。

对于铂基催化剂：

组成：以ZnAl2O4和MgAl2O4为载体的PtSn双金属催化剂
有效性：在正丁烷脱氢反应中表现出高活性和高选择性
工业应用：轻质烷烃的直接脱氢
最新发展：向Pt催化剂中添加Sn可提高活性、选择性和稳定性
潜在优势：在多个反应-再生循环中表现出良好的催化稳定性

由于缺乏关于金属氧化物基催化剂的信息，无法进行全面的比较。需要进行额外的研究才能全面回答这个问题，并比较这些不同类型的催化剂。
