[1] "Bimetallic catalysts supported on ZnAl2O4 and MgAl2O4 have been found to be active and selective for the direct dehydrogenation of light paraffins."

[2] "The use of ZnAl2O4 and MgAl2O4 as a support of PtSn is based on their neutral characteristics and very high thermal stability. The first characteristic is very important in paraffin dehydrogenation processes since a very high selectivity to olefins depends not only on adequate structure of the metallic phase but also on the low acidity of the support in order to minimize the undesirable lateral reactions (such as cracking and coke formation)"

[3] "The Sn addition to Pt/ZnAl2O4 and Pt/MgAl2O4 leads to an increase of the activity in n-butane dehydrogenation, and to high selectivity values to all butenes (1-butene, cis- and trans-2-butenes, and 1,3-butadiene)."

[4] "When Sn is added to Pt/MgAl2O4 and Pt/ZnAl2O4 catalysts, the tin reducibility is increased by either the catalytic effect of platinum or the PtSn co-reduction with probable alloy formation."

<EnglishVersionAnswer>

The literature primarily focuses on noble metal-based catalysts, particularly platinum and platinum-tin bimetallic catalysts, for the nonoxidative dehydrogenation of light olefins. It does not provide information on metal oxide-based catalysts like CrOx, gallium, indium, vanadium, zinc, and molybdenum oxides.

The compositions discussed are mainly PtSn supported on ZnAl2O4 and MgAl2O4. These catalysts have been found to be effective for the direct dehydrogenation of light paraffins, showing high activity and selectivity.

The effectiveness of these catalysts is demonstrated by their increased activity in n-butane dehydrogenation and high selectivity to butenes when tin is added to platinum. The bimetallic PtSn catalysts also show lower deactivation and higher stability over multiple reaction-regeneration cycles compared to monometallic Pt catalysts.

In terms of recent developments, the study explores the effect of different Sn loadings (0.3 and 0.5 wt%) on catalyst performance and investigates the complex structure of the metallic phase in bimetallic catalysts.

The potential advantages of these catalysts include:
1. High thermal stability due to the use of ZnAl2O4 and MgAl2O4 supports
2. Low acidity of the supports, which minimizes undesirable side reactions
3. Improved selectivity to olefins
4. Reduced coke formation
5. Enhanced catalytic stability over multiple reaction-regeneration cycles

The literature does not provide information on specific industrial applications of these catalysts.

该文献主要关注贵金属基催化剂，特别是铂和铂锡双金属催化剂，用于轻质烯烃的非氧化脱氢。它没有提供关于金属氧化物基催化剂如CrOx、镓、铟、钒、锌和钼氧化物的信息。

讨论的成分主要是以ZnAl2O4和MgAl2O4为载体的PtSn。这些催化剂被发现对轻质烷烃的直接脱氢有效，显示出高活性和选择性。

这些催化剂的有效性通过在铂中加入锡后n-丁烷脱氢活性的提高和对丁烯的高选择性得到证明。与单金属Pt催化剂相比，双金属PtSn催化剂在多个反应-再生循环中也表现出更低的失活和更高的稳定性。

在最新发展方面，该研究探讨了不同Sn负载量（0.3和0.5 wt%）对催化剂性能的影响，并研究了双金属催化剂中金属相的复杂结构。

这些催化剂的潜在优势包括：
1. 由于使用ZnAl2O4和MgAl2O4载体而具有高热稳定性
2. 载体酸性低，可最大限度地减少不良副反应
3. 提高对烯烃的选择性
4. 减少焦炭形成
5. 在多个反应-再生循环中提高催化稳定性

该文献没有提供这些催化剂的具体工业应用信息。

The given literature does not contain information to directly compare noble metal-based catalysts with metal oxide-based catalysts for light olefin dehydrogenation. The document focuses specifically on PtSn catalysts supported on ZnAl2O4 and MgAl2O4 for n-butane dehydrogenation. It does not discuss other metal oxide catalysts like CrOx, gallium, indium, vanadium, zinc, or molybdenum oxides. Therefore, I cannot provide a comprehensive comparison of noble metal and metal oxide catalysts for light olefin dehydrogenation based solely on the information in this document.

[4] "Besides, a very complex structure of the metallic phase appears to be present in the bimetallic catalysts. In fact, a probable description of this phase would involve the presence of Pt in zerovalent state, which could be partially alloyed with a fraction of zerovalent tin (according to CHD results)."
