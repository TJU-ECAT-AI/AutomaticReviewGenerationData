[1] "The Sn(0.3 or 0.5 wt.%) addition to Pt(0.3 wt.%)/ZnAl2O4 and Pt(0.3 wt.%)/MgAl2O4 catalysts leads to an increase of the activity and selectivity to olefins in the n-butane dehydrogenation reaction."

[2] "Bimetallic catalysts supported on ZnAl2O4 and MgAl2O4 have been found to be active and selective for the direct dehydrogenation of light paraffins."

[3] "PtSn catalysts supported on ZnAl2O4 and MgAl2O4 show good catalytic stability levels after five reaction-regeneration cycles, though the stability of the PtSn/MgAl2O4 catalyst was clearly higher than for the PtSn/ZnAl2O4 one."

[4] "When Sn is added to Pt/MgAl2O4 and Pt/ZnAl2O4 catalysts, the tin reducibility is increased by either the catalytic effect of platinum or the PtSn co-reduction with probable alloy formation."

The literature primarily focuses on platinum-based catalysts, particularly PtSn catalysts supported on ZnAl2O4 and MgAl2O4 for the dehydrogenation of light paraffins. It does not provide information on metal oxide-based catalysts like CrOx, gallium, indium, vanadium, zinc, and molybdenum oxides.

For the noble metal-based catalysts:

Composition: The catalysts consist of Pt (0.3 wt%) with Sn (0.3 or 0.5 wt%) supported on ZnAl2O4 or MgAl2O4.

Effectiveness: The addition of Sn to Pt catalysts leads to increased activity and selectivity to olefins in n-butane dehydrogenation. These bimetallic catalysts show good catalytic stability over multiple reaction-regeneration cycles.

Industrial applications: These catalysts are used for the direct dehydrogenation of light paraffins, specifically n-butane dehydrogenation in this study.

Recent developments: The research demonstrates the beneficial effects of adding Sn to Pt catalysts, including increased reducibility of tin and the formation of complex metallic phases that improve catalyst performance.

Potential advantages: PtSn catalysts show higher activity, selectivity, and stability compared to monometallic Pt catalysts. The PtSn/MgAl2O4 catalyst exhibits better stability than PtSn/ZnAl2O4.

The document does not provide information to compare these noble metal-based catalysts with metal oxide-based catalysts for light olefin dehydrogenation.
