[1] "Bimetallic catalysts supported on ZnAl2O4 and MgAl2O4 have been found to be active and selective for the direct dehydrogenation of light paraffins."

[2] "PtSn catalysts supported on ZnAl2O4 and MgAl2O4 show good catalytic stability levels after five reaction-regeneration cycles, though the stability of the PtSn/MgAl2O4 catalyst was clearly higher than for the PtSn/ZnAl2O4 one."

[3] "When Sn is added to Pt/MgAl2O4 and Pt/ZnAl2O4 catalysts, the tin reducibility is increased by either the catalytic effect of platinum or the PtSn co-reduction with probable alloy formation."

[4] "Besides, a very complex structure of the metallic phase appears to be present in the bimetallic catalysts. In fact, a probable description of this phase would involve the presence of Pt in zerovalent state, which could be partially alloyed with a fraction of zerovalent tin (according to CHD results)."

The literature focuses primarily on platinum-based catalysts, particularly PtSn bimetallic catalysts supported on ZnAl2O4 and MgAl2O4 for light paraffin dehydrogenation. It does not provide a direct comparison with metal oxide-based catalysts like CrOx, gallium, indium, vanadium, zinc, and molybdenum oxides.

From the information provided:

1. Composition: The catalysts discussed are bimetallic PtSn supported on ZnAl2O4 and MgAl2O4.

2. Effectiveness: These catalysts are described as active and selective for direct dehydrogenation of light paraffins.

3. Industrial applications: The catalysts are used for light paraffin dehydrogenation, which is important for producing olefins used in various industrial processes.

4. Recent developments: The study focuses on the effect of adding Sn to Pt catalysts, which increases tin reducibility and creates a complex metallic phase structure.

5. Potential advantages: PtSn bimetallic catalysts show good catalytic stability over multiple reaction-regeneration cycles, with PtSn/MgAl2O4 demonstrating higher stability than PtSn/ZnAl2O4.

The document does not provide information to compare these platinum-based catalysts with metal oxide-based catalysts mentioned in the question. To fully answer the question, additional research on metal oxide-based catalysts would be necessary.
