The given scientific literature does not contain information to answer this question. The document focuses on kinetic studies of isobutane dehydrogenation and isobutene hydrogenation over Pt/Sn-based catalysts, particularly comparing Pt/Sn/SiO2, Pt/Sn/K/SiO2, and Pt/Sn/KL-zeolite catalysts. It does not discuss or compare noble metal-based catalysts with metal oxide-based catalysts for light olefin dehydrogenation. The text does not mention CrOx, gallium, indium, vanadium, zinc, or molybdenum oxides. Therefore, I cannot provide a meaningful comparison or discussion of the compositions, effectiveness, industrial applications, recent developments, and potential advantages of these different catalyst types based on the given information.

给定的科学文献不包含回答这个问题的信息。该文件主要关注Pt/Sn基催化剂上异丁烷脱氢和异丁烯加氢的动力学研究，特别是比较了Pt/Sn/SiO2、Pt/Sn/K/SiO2和Pt/Sn/KL-沸石催化剂。它没有讨论或比较用于轻烯烃脱氢的贵金属基催化剂与金属氧化物基催化剂。文中没有提到CrOx、镓、铟、钒、锌或钼氧化物。因此，基于给定的信息，我无法就这些不同类型催化剂的成分、有效性、工业应用、最新发展和潜在优势提供有意义的比较或讨论。
