          "Zn is a common ingredient on noble metal catalysts to control the activity and selectivity in a wide range of reactions."

"These Zn-doped MCM-41-based Pt catalysts exhibit also an excellent behaviour in the dehydrogenation of iso-butane to iso-butene, with a selectivity as high as 100%, which remains stable with time on stream."

"Presence of Zn both into the siliceous framework or deposited on the MCM-41 surface causes an important increase in the selectivity, reaching a value of as high as 100%, which remains stable until the end of the experiment."

"Thus, the presence of ionic Zn in the vicinity of platinum nanoparticles can lead to a decrease in the number of contiguous accessible platinum sites (by a decoration effect), suppressing the undesired reactions and thereby enhancing selectivity and stability."

"It has been probed that these unwanted reactions require large platinum ensembles which constitute the active site whereas, on the contrary, the desired dehydrogenation reaction can proceed on small ensembles of surface platinum atoms."

"Another interesting reaction for which noble metal catalysts modified with zinc have shown an improved behaviour is the dehydrogenation of light alkanes to the corresponding alkenes [2224]. As described above, the addition of the second more electropositive metal gives rise to an increased catalytic activity, improved selectivity and catalyst lifetime."

          The literature primarily focuses on platinum-based catalysts modified with zinc for dehydrogenation reactions, rather than providing a comprehensive comparison with metal oxide-based catalysts. Key points about Pt-Zn catalysts include:

Composition: The catalysts are platinum supported on MCM-41 (a mesoporous silica material), with zinc incorporated either into the siliceous framework or deposited on the surface.

Effectiveness: Zn-modified Pt catalysts show excellent performance in the dehydrogenation of iso-butane to iso-butene, achieving 100% selectivity that remains stable over time. This represents a significant improvement over monometallic Pt catalysts.

Industrial applications: The catalysts are used for the dehydrogenation of light alkanes, specifically iso-butane to iso-butene, which is described as an important industrial reaction.

Recent developments: The study demonstrates that incorporating Zn into the silica framework of MCM-41 creates more stable and effective catalysts compared to conventional impregnation methods.

Potential advantages:
1. High selectivity (up to 100%) towards the desired product (iso-butene)
2. Stability over time, with no significant deactivation observed
3. Suppression of unwanted side reactions like cracking and isomerization
4. Improved catalyst lifetime

Mechanism: The presence of ionic Zn near platinum nanoparticles reduces the number of contiguous Pt sites, which suppresses undesired reactions that require large Pt ensembles. The desired dehydrogenation reaction can proceed on small ensembles of surface Pt atoms.

The document does not provide information on metal oxide-based catalysts like CrOx, gallium, indium, vanadium, or molybdenum oxides for comparison in light olefin dehydrogenation.

          这篇文献主要关注了用于脱氢反应的锌改性铂基催化剂，而不是提供与金属氧化物基催化剂的全面比较。关于铂-锌催化剂的主要观点包括：

成分：催化剂是以MCM-41（一种介孔二氧化硅材料）为载体的铂，其中锌要么被掺入硅质骨架，要么沉积在表面上。

有效性：锌改性的铂催化剂在异丁烷脱氢生成异丁烯的反应中表现出优异的性能，达到100%的选择性，并且随时间保持稳定。这比单金属铂催化剂有显著改进。

工业应用：这些催化剂用于轻烷烃的脱氢，特别是异丁烷脱氢生成异丁烯，被描述为一个重要的工业反应。

最新发展：研究表明，将锌掺入MCM-41的硅质骨架中，与传统的浸渍方法相比，可以创造出更稳定和有效的催化剂。

潜在优势：
1. 对目标产物（异丁烯）的高选择性（高达100%）
2. 随时间保持稳定，没有观察到明显的失活
3. 抑制了不需要的副反应，如裂解和异构化
4. 改善了催化剂寿命

机理：锌离子在铂纳米粒子附近的存在减少了连续铂位点的数量，从而抑制了需要大型铂集合体的不需要的反应。所需的脱氢反应可以在表面铂原子的小集合体上进行。

该文档没有提供关于CrOx、镓、铟、钒或钼氧化物等金属氧化物基催化剂在轻质烯烃脱氢方面的对比信息。
