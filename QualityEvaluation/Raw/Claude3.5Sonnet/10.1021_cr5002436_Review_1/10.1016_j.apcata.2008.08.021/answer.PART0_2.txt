[1] "Zn is a common ingredient on noble metal catalysts to control the activity and selectivity in a wide range of reactions."

[2] "Additionally, these Zn-modified MCM-41-based Pt catalysts show an excellent behaviour in an important industrial reaction such as the dehydrogenation of iso-butane to iso-butene, with a selectivity of 100%, which remains stable with time on stream."

[3] "Presence of Zn both into the siliceous framework or deposited on the MCM-41 surface causes an important increase in the selectivity, reaching a value of as high as 100%, which remains stable until the end of the experiment."

[4] "It has been probed that these unwanted reactions require large platinum ensembles which constitute the active site whereas, on the contrary, the desired dehydrogenation reaction can proceed on small ensembles of surface platinum atoms."

The literature primarily focuses on Pt-based catalysts modified with Zn for dehydrogenation reactions, rather than comparing noble metal catalysts with metal oxide catalysts. However, some insights can be drawn:

Composition: The study examines Pt catalysts supported on MCM-41, with Zn incorporated either into the siliceous framework or deposited on the surface. 

Effectiveness: Zn-modified Pt catalysts show excellent performance in the dehydrogenation of iso-butane to iso-butene, achieving 100% selectivity that remains stable over time. This suggests high effectiveness for light olefin dehydrogenation.

Industrial applications: The dehydrogenation of iso-butane to iso-butene is described as an important industrial reaction, indicating potential industrial relevance for these catalysts.

Recent developments: The study itself represents a recent development in using Zn-modified MCM-41 as a support for Pt catalysts in dehydrogenation reactions.

Potential advantages: The Zn-modified Pt catalysts show improved selectivity and stability compared to unmodified Pt catalysts. The presence of Zn helps suppress unwanted side reactions and coke formation, which are common issues in dehydrogenation processes.

While the document does not directly compare these catalysts with metal oxide-based catalysts like CrOx, gallium, indium, vanadium, or molybdenum oxides, it demonstrates that noble metal catalysts modified with promoters like Zn can achieve high performance in light olefin dehydrogenation reactions.

这篇文献主要关注了用于脱氢反应的锌改性铂基催化剂，而不是比较贵金属催化剂和金属氧化物催化剂。然而，我们可以得出一些见解：

成分：研究考察了以MCM-41为载体的铂催化剂，其中锌要么被掺入硅质骨架，要么沉积在表面上。

有效性：锌改性的铂催化剂在异丁烷脱氢生成异丁烯的反应中表现出优异的性能，达到100%的选择性，并且随时间保持稳定。这表明它对轻质烯烃脱氢具有高效性。

工业应用：异丁烷脱氢生成异丁烯被描述为一个重要的工业反应，表明这些催化剂可能具有工业相关性。

最新发展：该研究本身代表了在脱氢反应中使用锌改性MCM-41作为铂催化剂载体的最新发展。

潜在优势：与未改性的铂催化剂相比，锌改性的铂催化剂表现出更好的选择性和稳定性。锌的存在有助于抑制不需要的副反应和积碳形成，这些是脱氢过程中常见的问题。

虽然文件没有直接将这些催化剂与金属氧化物基催化剂（如CrOx、镓、铟、钒或钼氧化物）进行比较，但它表明，用锌等助剂改性的贵金属催化剂可以在轻质烯烃脱氢反应中实现高性能。
