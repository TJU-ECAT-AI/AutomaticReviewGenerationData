[1] "Zn is a common ingredient on noble metal catalysts to control the activity and selectivity in a wide range of reactions. In this sense, the presence of Zn either as a promoter [1820] or as a support (as ZnO) [21] has been shown to improve the catalytic behaviour of Pt catalysts in the chemoselective hydrogenation of a,b-unsaturated aldehydes (crotonaldehyde) to the corresponding unsaturated alcohol."

[2] "Another interesting reaction for which noble metal catalysts modified with zinc have shown an improved behaviour is the dehydrogenation of light alkanes to the corresponding alkenes [2224]. As described above, the addition of the second more electropositive metal gives rise to an increased catalytic activity, improved selectivity and catalyst lifetime."

[3] "Catalytic studies on the chemoselective hydrogenation of crotonaldehyde show that monometallic Pt/MCM-41 catalyst exhibits a high ability towards the hydrogenation of the olefinic double bond (C
C) to produce butyraldehyde. However, incorporation of Zn either into the siliceous matrix of the MCM-41 or deposited on the silica surface gives rise to an improved selectivity towards the formation of crotyl alcohol."

[4] "With regard to selectivity toward iso-butene (Fig. 6b) the monometallic catalyst shows an initial value of 10% which increases with time on stream up to 22%, cracking products (methane, ethane and propane) composing the rest of outlet gases. Presence of Zn both into the siliceous framework or deposited on the MCM-41 surface causes an important increase in the selectivity, reaching a value of as high as 100%, which remains stable until the end of the experiment."

The literature mainly focuses on platinum-based catalysts modified with zinc for dehydrogenation reactions, rather than comparing them directly with metal oxide-based catalysts. However, we can extract some information about Pt-Zn catalysts:

Composition: The catalysts discussed are primarily platinum supported on MCM-41 (a mesoporous silica material), with zinc incorporated either into the siliceous framework or deposited on the surface.

Effectiveness: Zinc-modified platinum catalysts show improved selectivity and stability compared to monometallic platinum catalysts. For iso-butane dehydrogenation, the presence of zinc increased selectivity to iso-butene from 10-22% to 100%, which remained stable over time.

Industrial applications: The catalysts were tested for two main reactions:
1. Chemoselective hydrogenation of crotonaldehyde to crotyl alcohol
2. Dehydrogenation of iso-butane to iso-butene

Recent developments: The study demonstrates that incorporating zinc into the siliceous framework of MCM-41 creates more stable and effective catalytic sites compared to conventional impregnation methods.

Potential advantages: Zinc-modified platinum catalysts show higher selectivity towards desired products and improved stability over time. They suppress unwanted side reactions like cracking and isomerization, which can lead to catalyst deactivation.

The literature does not provide information on other metal oxide-based catalysts (CrOx, gallium, indium, vanadium, or molybdenum oxides) for comparison.

该文献主要关注了用于脱氢反应的锌改性铂基催化剂，而不是直接与金属氧化物基催化剂进行比较。然而，我们可以从中提取一些关于铂-锌催化剂的信息：

成分：讨论的催化剂主要是以MCM-41（一种介孔二氧化硅材料）为载体的铂，其中锌要么被掺入硅质骨架，要么沉积在表面。

有效性：与单一金属铂催化剂相比，锌改性铂催化剂显示出改进的选择性和稳定性。对于异丁烷脱氢反应，锌的存在使异丁烯的选择性从10-22%提高到100%，并且随时间保持稳定。

工业应用：这些催化剂主要测试了两种反应：
1. 巴豆醛选择性加氢生成巴豆醇
2. 异丁烷脱氢生成异丁烯

最新发展：研究表明，将锌掺入MCM-41的硅质骨架中，与传统的浸渍方法相比，可以创造出更稳定和有效的催化位点。

潜在优势：锌改性铂催化剂对目标产物表现出更高的选择性，并且随时间推移具有更好的稳定性。它们抑制了不需要的副反应，如裂解和异构化，这些反应可能导致催化剂失活。

该文献没有提供其他金属氧化物基催化剂（CrOx、镓、铟、钒或钼氧化物）的对比信息。
