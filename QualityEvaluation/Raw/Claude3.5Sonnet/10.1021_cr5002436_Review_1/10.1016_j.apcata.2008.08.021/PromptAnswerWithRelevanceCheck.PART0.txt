[1] "These Zn-doped MCM-41-based Pt catalysts exhibit also an excellent behaviour in the dehydrogenation of iso-butane to iso-butene, with a selectivity as high as 100%, which remains stable with time on stream."

[2] "Presence of Zn both into the siliceous framework or deposited on the MCM-41 surface causes an important increase in the selectivity, reaching a value of as high as 100%, which remains stable until the end of the experiment."

[3] "Thus, the presence of ionic Zn in the vicinity of platinum nanoparticles can lead to a decrease in the number of contiguous accessible platinum sites (by a decoration effect), suppressing the undesired reactions and thereby enhancing selectivity and stability."

The literature primarily focuses on platinum-based catalysts for dehydrogenation, particularly those modified with zinc. It does not provide a comprehensive comparison with metal oxide-based catalysts.

Based on the information given:

Composition: The catalysts discussed are platinum supported on MCM-41, with zinc incorporated either into the siliceous framework or deposited on the surface.

Effectiveness: These Zn-modified Pt catalysts show excellent performance in the dehydrogenation of iso-butane to iso-butene, achieving 100% selectivity that remains stable over time.

Industrial applications: The catalysts are used for the dehydrogenation of light alkanes, specifically iso-butane to iso-butene.

Recent developments: The incorporation of zinc into the catalyst structure, either in the framework or on the surface, significantly improves selectivity and stability compared to monometallic Pt catalysts.

Potential advantages: The presence of ionic zinc near platinum nanoparticles reduces the number of contiguous platinum sites, suppressing undesired reactions and enhancing selectivity and stability. This effect is attributed to a "decoration effect" of zinc on platinum.

The literature does not provide information on CrOx, gallium, indium, vanadium, or molybdenum oxide catalysts for comparison.

The literature primarily focuses on platinum-based catalysts modified with zinc for dehydrogenation reactions, rather than comparing noble metal and metal oxide catalysts. However, some key points can be made:

Composition: The catalysts discussed are platinum supported on MCM-41 (mesoporous silica) with zinc incorporated either into the silica framework or deposited on the surface.

Effectiveness: Zn-modified Pt catalysts show excellent performance in the dehydrogenation of iso-butane to iso-butene, achieving 100% selectivity that remains stable over time.

Industrial applications: The dehydrogenation of iso-butane to iso-butene is described as an important industrial reaction.

Recent developments: The study demonstrates that incorporating Zn into the silica framework of MCM-41 creates more stable and effective catalysts compared to conventional impregnation methods.

Potential advantages: Zn modification of Pt catalysts improves selectivity and stability by suppressing undesired side reactions. This is achieved through a decoration effect, where Zn reduces the number of contiguous Pt sites responsible for unwanted reactions.

While the document does not directly compare noble metal catalysts with metal oxide catalysts like CrOx, gallium, indium, vanadium, or molybdenum oxides, it highlights the benefits of combining noble metals (Pt) with promoter metals (Zn) for improved catalyst performance in dehydrogenation reactions.

The literature primarily discusses platinum-based catalysts modified with zinc for the dehydrogenation of light alkanes, specifically iso-butane. It does not provide a comprehensive comparison with other metal oxide-based catalysts mentioned in the question.

For platinum-based catalysts:

Composition: The catalysts discussed are Pt supported on MCM-41, with zinc incorporated either into the siliceous framework or deposited on the surface.

Effectiveness: These catalysts show excellent performance in the dehydrogenation of iso-butane to iso-butene, with selectivity as high as 100% that remains stable over time.

Recent developments: The incorporation of zinc into the catalyst system, either in the framework or on the surface, significantly improves selectivity and stability compared to monometallic Pt catalysts.

Potential advantages: 
1. High selectivity (up to 100%) towards the desired product (iso-butene)
2. Stability over time, with no significant deactivation observed
3. Suppression of unwanted side reactions like cracking and isomerization

Mechanism: The presence of ionic zinc near platinum nanoparticles reduces the number of contiguous platinum sites, which suppresses undesired reactions that require large platinum ensembles. The desired dehydrogenation reaction can proceed on small ensembles of surface platinum atoms.

The document does not provide information on industrial applications or comparisons with other metal oxide-based catalysts like CrOx, gallium, indium, vanadium, or molybdenum oxides for light olefin dehydrogenation.

[1] "Zn is a common ingredient on noble metal catalysts to control the activity and selectivity in a wide range of reactions. In this sense, the presence of Zn either as a promoter [1820] or as a support (as ZnO) [21] has been shown to improve the catalytic behaviour of Pt catalysts in the chemoselective hydrogenation of a,b-unsaturated aldehydes (crotonaldehyde) to the corresponding unsaturated alcohol."

[2] "Another interesting reaction for which noble metal catalysts modified with zinc have shown an improved behaviour is the dehydrogenation of light alkanes to the corresponding alkenes [2224]. As described above, the addition of the second more electropositive metal gives rise to an increased catalytic activity, improved selectivity and catalyst lifetime."

[3] "Catalytic studies on the chemoselective hydrogenation of crotonaldehyde show that monometallic Pt/MCM-41 catalyst exhibits a high ability towards the hydrogenation of the olefinic double bond (C
C) to produce butyraldehyde. However, incorporation of Zn either into the siliceous matrix of the MCM-41 or deposited on the silica surface gives rise to an improved selectivity towards the formation of crotyl alcohol."

[4] "With regard to selectivity toward iso-butene (Fig. 6b) the monometallic catalyst shows an initial value of 10% which increases with time on stream up to 22%, cracking products (methane, ethane and propane) composing the rest of outlet gases. Presence of Zn both into the siliceous framework or deposited on the MCM-41 surface causes an important increase in the selectivity, reaching a value of as high as 100%, which remains stable until the end of the experiment."

The literature mainly focuses on platinum-based catalysts modified with zinc for dehydrogenation reactions, rather than comparing them directly with metal oxide-based catalysts. However, we can extract some information about Pt-Zn catalysts:

Composition: The catalysts discussed are primarily platinum supported on MCM-41 (a mesoporous silica material), with zinc incorporated either into the siliceous framework or deposited on the surface.

Effectiveness: Zinc-modified platinum catalysts show improved selectivity and stability compared to monometallic platinum catalysts. For iso-butane dehydrogenation, the presence of zinc increased selectivity to iso-butene from 10-22% to 100%, which remained stable over time.

Industrial applications: The catalysts were tested for two main reactions:
1. Chemoselective hydrogenation of crotonaldehyde to crotyl alcohol
2. Dehydrogenation of iso-butane to iso-butene

Recent developments: The study demonstrates that incorporating zinc into the siliceous framework of MCM-41 creates more stable and effective catalytic sites compared to conventional impregnation methods.

Potential advantages: Zinc-modified platinum catalysts show higher selectivity towards desired products and improved stability over time. They suppress unwanted side reactions like cracking and isomerization, which can lead to catalyst deactivation.

The literature does not provide information on other metal oxide-based catalysts (CrOx, gallium, indium, vanadium, or molybdenum oxides) for comparison.
