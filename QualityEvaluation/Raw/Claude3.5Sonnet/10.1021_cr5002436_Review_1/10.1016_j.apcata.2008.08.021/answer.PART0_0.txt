[1] "These Zn-doped MCM-41-based Pt catalysts exhibit also an excellent behaviour in the dehydrogenation of iso-butane to iso-butene, with a selectivity as high as 100%, which remains stable with time on stream."

[2] "Presence of Zn both into the siliceous framework or deposited on the MCM-41 surface causes an important increase in the selectivity, reaching a value of as high as 100%, which remains stable until the end of the experiment."

[3] "Thus, the presence of ionic Zn in the vicinity of platinum nanoparticles can lead to a decrease in the number of contiguous accessible platinum sites (by a decoration effect), suppressing the undesired reactions and thereby enhancing selectivity and stability."

The literature primarily focuses on platinum-based catalysts for dehydrogenation, particularly those modified with zinc. It does not provide a comprehensive comparison with metal oxide-based catalysts.

Based on the information given:

Composition: The catalysts discussed are platinum supported on MCM-41, with zinc incorporated either into the siliceous framework or deposited on the surface.

Effectiveness: These Zn-modified Pt catalysts show excellent performance in the dehydrogenation of iso-butane to iso-butene, achieving 100% selectivity that remains stable over time.

Industrial applications: The catalysts are used for the dehydrogenation of light alkanes, specifically iso-butane to iso-butene.

Recent developments: The incorporation of zinc into the catalyst structure, either in the framework or on the surface, significantly improves selectivity and stability compared to monometallic Pt catalysts.

Potential advantages: The presence of ionic zinc near platinum nanoparticles reduces the number of contiguous platinum sites, suppressing undesired reactions and enhancing selectivity and stability. This effect is attributed to a "decoration effect" of zinc on platinum.

The literature does not provide information on CrOx, gallium, indium, vanadium, or molybdenum oxide catalysts for comparison.

该文献主要关注铂基催化剂用于脱氢反应，特别是那些经锌修饰的催化剂。它没有提供与金属氧化物基催化剂的全面比较。

根据给出的信息：

组成：讨论的催化剂是以MCM-41为载体的铂，锌要么被掺入硅质骨架中，要么沉积在表面上。

有效性：这些锌修饰的铂催化剂在异丁烷脱氢生成异丁烯的反应中表现出色，达到100%的选择性，并且随时间保持稳定。

工业应用：这些催化剂用于轻烷烃的脱氢，特别是异丁烷脱氢生成异丁烯。

最新发展：将锌掺入催化剂结构中，无论是在骨架中还是在表面上，都显著提高了选择性和稳定性，相比单金属铂催化剂有明显改善。

潜在优势：离子态锌在铂纳米粒子附近的存在减少了连续铂位点的数量，抑制了不需要的反应，从而提高了选择性和稳定性。这种效果被归因于锌对铂的"装饰效应"。

该文献没有提供关于CrOx、镓、铟、钒或钼氧化物催化剂的比较信息。
