[1] "These Zn-doped MCM-41-based Pt catalysts exhibit also an excellent behaviour in the dehydrogenation of iso-butane to iso-butene, with a selectivity as high as 100%, which remains stable with time on stream."

[2] "Presence of Zn both into the siliceous framework or deposited on the MCM-41 surface causes an important increase in the selectivity, reaching a value of as high as 100%, which remains stable until the end of the experiment."

[3] "It has been probed that these unwanted reactions require large platinum ensembles which constitute the active site whereas, on the contrary, the desired dehydrogenation reaction can proceed on small ensembles of surface platinum atoms"

[4] "Thus, the presence of ionic Zn in the vicinity of platinum nanoparticles can lead to a decrease in the number of contiguous accessible platinum sites (by a decoration effect), suppressing the undesired reactions and thereby enhancing selectivity and stability."

The literature primarily discusses platinum-based catalysts modified with zinc for the dehydrogenation of light alkanes, specifically iso-butane. It does not provide a comprehensive comparison with other metal oxide-based catalysts mentioned in the question.

For platinum-based catalysts:

Composition: The catalysts discussed are Pt supported on MCM-41, with zinc incorporated either into the siliceous framework or deposited on the surface.

Effectiveness: These catalysts show excellent performance in the dehydrogenation of iso-butane to iso-butene, with selectivity as high as 100% that remains stable over time.

Recent developments: The incorporation of zinc into the catalyst system, either in the framework or on the surface, significantly improves selectivity and stability compared to monometallic Pt catalysts.

Potential advantages: 
1. High selectivity (up to 100%) towards the desired product (iso-butene)
2. Stability over time, with no significant deactivation observed
3. Suppression of unwanted side reactions like cracking and isomerization

Mechanism: The presence of ionic zinc near platinum nanoparticles reduces the number of contiguous platinum sites, which suppresses undesired reactions that require large platinum ensembles. The desired dehydrogenation reaction can proceed on small ensembles of surface platinum atoms.

The document does not provide information on industrial applications or comparisons with other metal oxide-based catalysts like CrOx, gallium, indium, vanadium, or molybdenum oxides for light olefin dehydrogenation.

该文献主要讨论了用于轻烷烃（特别是异丁烷）脱氢的锌改性铂基催化剂。它没有提供与问题中提到的其他金属氧化物基催化剂的全面比较。

对于铂基催化剂：

组成：讨论的催化剂是以MCM-41为载体的铂，锌要么掺入硅基骨架，要么沉积在表面。

有效性：这些催化剂在异丁烷脱氢生成异丁烯的反应中表现出优异的性能，选择性高达100%，并且随时间保持稳定。

最新发展：将锌掺入催化剂系统（无论是在骨架中还是在表面上）显著提高了选择性和稳定性，相比单金属铂催化剂有明显改善。

潜在优势：
1. 对目标产物（异丁烯）的高选择性（高达100%）
2. 随时间保持稳定，没有观察到明显的失活
3. 抑制了不需要的副反应，如裂解和异构化

机理：锌离子在铂纳米粒子附近的存在减少了连续铂位点的数量，从而抑制了需要大型铂集合体的不需要的反应。所需的脱氢反应可以在表面铂原子的小集合体上进行。

该文档没有提供关于工业应用或与其他金属氧化物基催化剂（如CrOx、镓、铟、钒或钼氧化物）在轻烯烃脱氢方面的比较信息。
