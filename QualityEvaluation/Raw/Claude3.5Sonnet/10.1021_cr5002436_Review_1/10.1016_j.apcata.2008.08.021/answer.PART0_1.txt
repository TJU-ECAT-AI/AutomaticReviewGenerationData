[1] "Zn is a common ingredient on noble metal catalysts to control the activity and selectivity in a wide range of reactions."

[2] "Additionally, these Zn-modified MCM-41-based Pt catalysts show an excellent behaviour in an important industrial reaction such as the dehydrogenation of iso-butane to iso-butene, with a selectivity of 100%, which remains stable with time on stream."

[3] "Presence of Zn both into the siliceous framework or deposited on the MCM-41 surface causes an important increase in the selectivity, reaching a value of as high as 100%, which remains stable until the end of the experiment."

[4] "Thus, the presence of ionic Zn in the vicinity of platinum nanoparticles can lead to a decrease in the number of contiguous accessible platinum sites (by a decoration effect), suppressing the undesired reactions and thereby enhancing selectivity and stability."

The literature primarily focuses on platinum-based catalysts modified with zinc for dehydrogenation reactions, rather than comparing noble metal and metal oxide catalysts. However, some key points can be made:

Composition: The catalysts discussed are platinum supported on MCM-41 (mesoporous silica) with zinc incorporated either into the silica framework or deposited on the surface.

Effectiveness: Zn-modified Pt catalysts show excellent performance in the dehydrogenation of iso-butane to iso-butene, achieving 100% selectivity that remains stable over time.

Industrial applications: The dehydrogenation of iso-butane to iso-butene is described as an important industrial reaction.

Recent developments: The study demonstrates that incorporating Zn into the silica framework of MCM-41 creates more stable and effective catalysts compared to conventional impregnation methods.

Potential advantages: Zn modification of Pt catalysts improves selectivity and stability by suppressing undesired side reactions. This is achieved through a decoration effect, where Zn reduces the number of contiguous Pt sites responsible for unwanted reactions.

While the document does not directly compare noble metal catalysts with metal oxide catalysts like CrOx, gallium, indium, vanadium, or molybdenum oxides, it highlights the benefits of combining noble metals (Pt) with promoter metals (Zn) for improved catalyst performance in dehydrogenation reactions.

该文献主要集中讨论了用锌改性的铂基催化剂在脱氢反应中的应用,而没有直接比较贵金属和金属氧化物催化剂。然而,我们可以总结出以下几个要点:

成分:文中讨论的催化剂是以MCM-41(介孔二氧化硅)为载体的铂催化剂,锌要么被掺入二氧化硅骨架,要么沉积在表面。

有效性:锌改性的铂催化剂在异丁烷脱氢生成异丁烯的反应中表现出色,达到100%的选择性,并且随时间保持稳定。

工业应用:异丁烷脱氢生成异丁烯被描述为一个重要的工业反应。

最新发展:研究表明,将锌掺入MCM-41的二氧化硅骨架中,比传统的浸渍方法制备出更稳定和更有效的催化剂。

潜在优势:锌对铂催化剂的改性通过抑制不需要的副反应,提高了选择性和稳定性。这是通过装饰效应实现的,其中锌减少了负责不需要反应的连续铂位点的数量。

虽然文档没有直接比较贵金属催化剂与CrOx、镓、铟、钒或钼氧化物等金属氧化物催化剂,但它强调了将贵金属(Pt)与助催化金属(Zn)结合以改善催化剂在脱氢反应中的性能的好处。
