The given scientific literature does not contain information about metal oxide-based catalysts for dehydrogenation of light olefins. The document focuses solely on platinum (Pt) and platinum-tin (PtSn) catalysts supported on alumina and silica for propane dehydrogenation. It does not discuss or compare these catalysts with metal oxide-based catalysts such as CrOx, gallium, indium, vanadium, zinc, or molybdenum oxides. Therefore, I cannot provide a comparison or contrast between noble metal-based catalysts and metal oxide-based catalysts for light olefin dehydrogenation based on this specific document.

给定的科学文献中不包含关于用于轻烯烃脱氢的金属氧化物催化剂的信息。该文档仅关注以氧化铝和二氧化硅为载体的铂(Pt)和铂-锡(PtSn)催化剂用于丙烷脱氢。它没有讨论或比较这些催化剂与金属氧化物催化剂,如CrOx、镓、铟、钒、锌或钼氧化物。因此,我无法基于这份特定文档对贵金属基催化剂和金属氧化物基催化剂在轻烯烃脱氢方面进行比较或对比。

The given scientific literature does not contain information about noble metal-based catalysts (other than platinum) or metal oxide-based catalysts like CrOx, gallium, indium, vanadium, zinc, and molybdenum oxides for the nonoxidative dehydrogenation of light olefins. The document focuses specifically on platinum and platinum-tin catalysts supported on alumina and silica for propane dehydrogenation. It does not discuss or compare these catalysts with other metal or metal oxide catalysts for light olefin dehydrogenation.

The literature provides detailed information on the preparation, characterization, and catalytic performance of Pt and PtSn catalysts on Al2O3 and SiO2 supports for propane dehydrogenation, but does not contain relevant information to answer the question about comparing noble metal catalysts with metal oxide catalysts for light olefin dehydrogenation more broadly.

给定的科学文献并不包含关于贵金属催化剂(除铂外)或金属氧化物催化剂(如CrOx、镓、铟、钒、锌和钼氧化物)用于轻质烯烃非氧化脱氢的信息。该文档特别关注了以氧化铝和二氧化硅为载体的铂和铂锡催化剂在丙烷脱氢中的应用。它没有讨论或比较这些催化剂与其他金属或金属氧化物催化剂在轻质烯烃脱氢中的应用。

该文献提供了关于Al2O3和SiO2负载的Pt和PtSn催化剂在丙烷脱氢中的制备、表征和催化性能的详细信息，但不包含相关信息来回答关于比较贵金属催化剂与金属氧化物催化剂在更广泛的轻质烯烃脱氢应用中的问题。

The given scientific literature does not contain information about noble metal-based catalysts (other than platinum) or metal oxide-based catalysts like CrOx, gallium, indium, vanadium, zinc, and molybdenum oxides for the nonoxidative dehydrogenation of light olefins. The document focuses on platinum and platinum-tin catalysts supported on alumina and silica for propane dehydrogenation. It does not discuss or compare these catalysts with other metal oxide-based systems.

The literature primarily examines the preparation, characterization, and activity measurements of Pt and PtSn catalysts on Al2O3 and SiO2 supports. It investigates the effects of tin as a promoter, the state of platinum and tin in reduced catalysts, and the catalytic activity, selectivity, and stability of these systems. However, it does not provide information on other noble metals or metal oxide catalysts for light olefin dehydrogenation.

Without additional information from other sources, it is not possible to adequately compare and contrast the noble metal-based catalysts with metal oxide-based catalysts for light olefin dehydrogenation, or discuss their relative compositions, effectiveness, industrial applications, recent developments, and potential advantages in the field.

给定的科学文献并未包含关于贵金属催化剂（除铂以外）或金属氧化物催化剂（如CrOx、镓、铟、钒、锌和钼氧化物）用于轻质烯烃非氧化脱氢的信息。该文档主要关注铝氧化物和二氧化硅负载的铂和铂锡催化剂用于丙烷脱氢。它没有讨论或比较这些催化剂与其他金属氧化物体系。

该文献主要研究了Al2O3和SiO2负载的Pt和PtSn催化剂的制备、表征和活性测量。它探讨了锡作为助剂的效果、还原态催化剂中铂和锡的状态，以及这些体系的催化活性、选择性和稳定性。然而，它没有提供其他贵金属或金属氧化物催化剂用于轻质烯烃脱氢的信息。

没有其他来源的额外信息，无法充分比较和对比贵金属催化剂与金属氧化物催化剂用于轻质烯烃脱氢的情况，也无法讨论它们在该领域的相对组成、有效性、工业应用、最新发展和潜在优势。

The given literature does not contain information to directly compare and contrast noble metal-based catalysts (particularly Platinum) with metal oxide-based catalysts (such as CrOx, gallium, indium, vanadium, zinc, and molybdenum oxides) for the nonoxidative dehydrogenation of light olefins. The document focuses specifically on Platinum and Platinum-Tin catalysts supported on alumina and silica for propane dehydrogenation. It does not discuss metal oxide catalysts or provide a broad comparison of different catalyst types for light olefin dehydrogenation.

To answer this question comprehensively would require additional sources covering metal oxide catalysts and their applications in olefin dehydrogenation. The current literature is limited in scope to Pt and PtSn systems.

给定的文献不包含直接比较和对比贵金属基催化剂(特别是铂)与金属氧化物基催化剂(如CrOx、镓、铟、钒、锌和钼氧化物)用于轻烯烃非氧化脱氢的信息。该文档特别关注在氧化铝和二氧化硅上负载的铂和铂-锡催化剂用于丙烷脱氢。它没有讨论金属氧化物催化剂，也没有就轻烯烃脱氢的不同类型催化剂提供广泛的比较。

要全面回答这个问题，需要额外的资料来涵盖金属氧化物催化剂及其在烯烃脱氢中的应用。目前的文献仅限于Pt和PtSn系统的范围。

The given scientific literature does not contain information about metal oxide-based catalysts for light olefin dehydrogenation or comparisons between noble metal and metal oxide catalysts. The document focuses specifically on platinum and platinum-tin catalysts supported on alumina and silica for propane dehydrogenation. It does not discuss other metal oxides like chromium, gallium, indium, vanadium, zinc or molybdenum oxides. Therefore, this question cannot be directly answered based on the provided text.

However, the document does provide some relevant information about platinum-based catalysts for propane dehydrogenation:

1. Platinum catalysts show high initial activity but deactivate rapidly due to coking.

2. Adding tin as a promoter to platinum improves catalyst stability and selectivity.

3. The effect of tin promotion depends on the support - on alumina it mainly affects dispersion and stability, while on silica it also reduces specific activity.

4. Platinum-tin catalysts on alumina maintain high activity while reducing side reactions like cracking.

5. The state of tin (oxidized vs. reduced/alloyed) affects the catalytic properties.

6. Recent developments have focused on understanding the role of hydrogen spillover and metal-support interactions in these catalysts.

While this information is limited to platinum-based systems, it demonstrates some of the key considerations in developing effective dehydrogenation catalysts, such as activity, selectivity, stability, and metal-support interactions. These factors would likely also be important when comparing noble metal and metal oxide catalysts, even though such a comparison is not provided in this specific document.

给出的科学文献中不包含关于用于轻烯烃脱氢的金属氧化物催化剂的信息，也没有贵金属和金属氧化物催化剂之间的比较。该文档特别关注铝氧化物和二氧化硅上负载的铂和铂-锡催化剂用于丙烷脱氢。它没有讨论其他金属氧化物，如铬、镓、铟、钒、锌或钼的氧化物。因此，无法根据提供的文本直接回答这个问题。

然而，该文档确实提供了一些关于铂基催化剂用于丙烷脱氢的相关信息：

1. 铂催化剂显示出高的初始活性，但由于结焦而快速失活。

2. 添加锡作为助剂可以改善铂催化剂的稳定性和选择性。

3. 锡促进的效果取决于载体 - 在氧化铝上主要影响分散度和稳定性，而在二氧化硅上还会降低比活性。

4. 氧化铝上的铂-锡催化剂保持高活性，同时减少了裂解等副反应。

5. 锡的状态（氧化态与还原/合金态）影响催化性能。

6. 最近的研究集中在理解这些催化剂中氢溢流和金属-载体相互作用的作用。

虽然这些信息仅限于铂基体系，但它展示了开发有效脱氢催化剂的一些关键考虑因素，如活性、选择性、稳定性和金属-载体相互作用。这些因素在比较贵金属和金属氧化物催化剂时可能也很重要，尽管这份特定文档中没有提供这样的比较。
