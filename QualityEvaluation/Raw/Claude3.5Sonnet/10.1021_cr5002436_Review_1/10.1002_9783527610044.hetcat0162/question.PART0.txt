Dehydrogenation of Alkanes

Introduction
14.6.1.1
Importance of Light Alkenes
Light alkenes are among the most important intermediate
products in the chemical industry. For example, in 2003,
the worldwide production of ethene was 100 × 106 t
and approximately 56 × 106 t for propene [1]. Ethene
is primarily used for the production of polymers,
especially polyethylenes (HDPE,
LDPE, LLDPE) or
precursors of other polymer compounds such as 1,2-
dichloroethane/vinyl chloride as a precursor of PVC,
ethylbenzene/styrene as a precursor of polystyrene or
ethylene oxide as a precursor of ethylene glycols or
polyethoxylates.
Propene is also important for the production of
polymers, mainly for the production of polypropylene

14.6.2 Conceptual Approach

(PP), but also in the production of cumene, acrylonitrile,
acrylic acid/acrolein or propylene oxide [2].
Other light alkenes are used much less frequently
in comparison with the above two alkenes, ethene and
propene. Butenes (1-butene, 2-butenes and isobutene) are
chiefly used for the production of high-octane gasoline
additives (MTBE, ETBE in the case of isobutene, alkylates
in the case of n-butenes). Even-numbered α-alkenes (such
as 1-hexene or 1-octene) are used as co-monomers for
the production of polyethylenes or polypropylenes. The
significance of the remaining light alkenes is low.
Steam cracking of hydrocarbons is the most important
process for the production of light alkenes. World-scale
steam crackers have the capacity to produce more than
106 t per annum of ethene.
Another source of low alkenes, especially propene, is
catalytic cracking in the form of fluid catalytic cracking
(FCC). In a refinery, FCC is used for the production of fuel
components (gasoline and kerosene or diesel oils) from
high-boiling crude oil distillation fractions. In addition,
low alkenes, especially propene and butenes, are also
formed in this process, which at present is preferably
performed with zeolite-type catalysts.
In 2002, approximately 61% of propene production
was via steam cracking and approximately 34% was
obtained by catalytic cracking. To cover the continuously
increasing demand for propene, it was also necessary to
generate about another 3% by catalytic dehydrogenation
of propane [3]. The remaining amount was obtained from
other processes such as metathesis or deep catalytic
cracking (DCC) of vacuum gas oil (VGO).
An increase in the share of the catalytic dehydrogenation
of propane in the overall production of propene can be
expected. On the one hand, the production of propene in
existing naphtha crackers cannot be increased without
limit at the cost of ethene production since, as a
matter of principle, thermodynamic limits prevent a
propene/ethene ratio of approximately 0.60.7 from being
exceeded. On the other hand, predominantly ethane-based
steam crackers are being built that produce only a small
amount of propene, and the production of propene in
these systems is generally not economically justifiable.
Furthermore, the predicted growth rate for propene is
higher than that for ethene [4].
14.6.1.2
Historical Developments
In the 1940s, UOP (Universal Oil Products) built plants
for the catalytic dehydrogenation of butanes. Chro-
mia/alumina catalysts were used in these systems [5].
The butenes generated in these systems were dimerized
and served for the production of aircraft fuel. At the
same time, Houdry developed a comparable process for
the catalytic dehydrogenation of n-butane. This develop-
ment was further extended, leading to the CATADIEN
process, which became the first commercial process for
producing 1,3-butadiene via catalytic dehydrogenation of
n-butane.
Platinum-based dehydrogenation catalysts were used
for the first time in the 1960s. Their initial application
was in the PACOL process by UOP for producing linear
alkenes for detergents [5].
Oxidative dehydrogenation was used commercially for
the first time in 1965 in the Oxo-D process by Petrotex for
producing 1,3-butadiene [6]. A comparable development
by Phillips led to the O-X-D process [7, 8].
Other systems were developed subsequently, especially
for the dehydrogenation of isobutane. The isobutene
produced in these plants primarily served to produce
MTBE as a high-octane fuel additive. The availability of
propane from the processing of natural gas or associated
gas from crude oil production led to an increased
interest in propane dehydrogenation. For this reason,
the economics-driven focus now lies on systems for the
catalytic dehydrogenation of propane.
At
present,
processes
for
propane
dehydrogena-
tion are commercially available that work with both
platinum-based catalysts (the UOP Oleflex process [9],
the Uhde STAR process [2] and the Linde/BASF PDH
process [10]) and chromia/alumina catalysts (the ABB
Lummus CATOFIN process [11] and the Snamprogetti-
Yarsintez FBD process [12, 13]).
14.6.2
Conceptual Approach
The technical realization of catalytic alkane dehydrogena-
tion is problematic, despite its simple stoichiometry. On
the one hand, this is due to the thermodynamic limitation
of alkane conversion. On the other hand, the reaction is
strongly endothermic. For example, the following holds
true for the dehydrogenation of propane:
C3H8



C3H6 + H2
(H 
298 = +124.3 kJ mol1)

14.6.2.1
Influence of Temperature on the Equilibrium
Figure 1 shows the equilibrium conversion for selected
alkanes as a function of reaction temperature. To achieve
technically relevant conversions of 3050%, reaction
temperatures of 825975 K are required for propane and
775825 K are correspondingly required for isobutane. As
the carbon number of the alkanes to be dehydrogenated
increases, the reaction temperature falls. In contrast,
