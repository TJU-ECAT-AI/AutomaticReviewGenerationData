Abstract
Credit card lending in Asia has grown rapidly since the 1997 Asian
Financial Crisis. But this growth so far has seen several episodes of
sharp booms and busts, posing new risks to financial stability. This
chapter attempts to learn more about the credit card markets and shed
light on and draw lessons from some of the core common elements in
the three recent episodes of credit card lending distress in Asia. Of the
episodes in Hong Kong, Korea and Taiwan during the 2000s, Korea
experienced the most serious boom-bust cycle in 2003. Therefore, we
take a closer look at the credit card lending crisis there. Easy monetary
conditions, financial liberalization, economies of scales in the credit
card business, limited information reporting and sharing, various forms
of the principal-agent problem, and the seasoning effect of a fast-
growing lending portfolio all contributed to unsustainable credit
lending boom. Eventually, excessive indebtedness led to rising credit
cost and tighter lending standard, contracting credit, further credit loss,
big balance sheet adjustments, risks to the financial system and damages
to the economy. Policymakers in Asian emerging markets such as China
and India need to learn about the risks arising from this type of con-
sumer lending and respond with enhanced supervisory capacity, better
market infrastructure, and appropriate prudential measures.

1. Introduction
Against a background of the excessive US household indebtedness
and ongoing global financial turmoil, consumer credit in Asia has
grown significantly in recent years. While housing finance has domi-
nated the lending to households and thus received the bulk of

attention, unsecured personal lending has also expanded rapidly,
albeit from a relatively low basis. With rising affluence, banks more
oriented to the apparent higher risk-adjusted returns on household
lending, and policymakers strategy to pursue more domestic
demand-driven growth, the credit card business has been one of the
fastest-growing areas of unsecured retail finance in many Asian mar-
kets. Expanding credit card markets improve access to credit by a
broader portion of the population and represent a more important
source of profits for banks and other lenders. They may also affect the
transmission of monetary policy and pose new challenges to financial
stability. 
The levels of outstanding credit card holdings and loans in Asia
have not always converged smoothly to levels seen in mature markets.
Rather, in this decade, Asia has witnessed cycles of marked credit card
lending booms and busts in a number of its markets. This chapter
takes stock of the recent experience in Asian credit card markets gen-
erally and examines three episodes of credit card lending distress in
particular: Hong Kong in 2002, Korea in 2003 and Chinese Taipei
(hereafter Taiwan) in 2006. Our analysis attempts to shed light on
three questions. First, why did competition in a line of business that is
well established elsewhere still from time to time lead to excessive
credit card lending? Second, what was the character of the busts fol-
lowing the credit card lending booms? Third, what lessons can be
learned from these episodes? Answers to these questions will be espe-
cially valuable to a number of populous emerging Asian markets, such
as China and India, where the credit card segment of retail finance is
just starting to take off. 
These three Asian episodes of credit card lending booms and
busts share several common elements in terms of their approximate
causes, symptoms, dynamics and consequences: intensified competi-
tion in the high-yield, less prime, credit card lending business leading
to reduced lending standards; a rapid build-up in household indebt-
edness; a disproportionate concentration of debt burdens among
riskier cardholders; a significant and sudden deterioration of asset
quality; and a subsequent prolonged contraction in credit card receiv-
ables. The bottom line is that, as consumer finance becomes an

important part of Asias financial system, policymakers need to better
understand the associated risks and be prepared to respond.
The chapter is partially based on Kang and Ma (2007) and struc-
tured as follows. Section 2 discusses recent trends in Asias credit card
sector. Section 3 examines the three recent episodes of credit card
lending distress in Asia and highlights the common ingredients of
these boom-bust cycles. Section 4 undertakes a more detailed case
study of Korea during 20022003 and examines issues related to fac-
tors influencing credit card asset quality. Section 5 explores some
policy lessons from these three episodes of credit card lending distress
in Asia, and Section 6 concludes. 
2. Asias Credit Card Sector
Since the 1997 Asian financial crisis, lending to households has out-
paced the increase in total bank loans in Asia from low initial levels
(Figure 10-1).2 Korea and Malaysia, for example, had household loans
that accounted for about one-quarter of their respective total bank loans
outstanding in 1998, but now represent half of their respective overall
loan books, as lending to consumers grew twice as fast that of the total
bank loans. In Chinas case, the loans to the household sector increased
more than 48-fold between 2000 and 2005, albeit from a tiny base. 
A combination of demand- and supply-side factors has con-
tributed to this marked shift to consumer finance. First, after the
Asian financial crisis, weak corporate loan demand and easier mone-
tary policy to spur the economy led to ample liquidity in the banking
systems. In most of the Asian economies, the investment-to-GDP
ratios today remain well below the 1997 levels. During 19982000,
the loan-to-deposit ratios in Hong Kong, Korea and Taiwan declined
by 1015 percentage points. This, together with capital saving from
mortgage business, put pressure on banks to tap the consumer
finance business aggressively. Since it had previously been neglected
in many Asian markets, such lending offered banks both potentially

higher margins and diversification benefits. Second, rising living stan-
dards and house prices in many Asian markets probably increased
consumer demand for credit as consumer finance is often regarded as
a superior good. Third, information technology reduced the costs of
retail finance in setting up risk and account management systems.
Finally, financial deregulation, new local and foreign entrants and
government policies boosted formal lending to the household sector.
Against this background, the credit card segment of consumer
lending is rapidly gaining ground in Asia. One flow measure of Asias
credit card sector is credit card billing (Figure 10-2).3 Total credit
card usage volume, including the use of cards to make purchases of
goods and services and to withdraw cash, increased by 200% to 500%
in many Asian markets between 1998 and 2006. Of the total credit
card billing, 80% to 90% are for goods and services purchases and the

chases and cash lending. Finally, following common practice in most markets,

remaining 10% to 20% are for cash lending (Figure 10-3).
Furthermore, as a share of private consumption expenditure, card
purchases have been on an upward trend for most Asian economies,
reaching 10% to 20%. One notable example is Korea, where cash
advance represented 65% of the total credit card billing at one point
and purchases of goods and services using cards occupied as high as
60% of the private consumption expenditure.4
Meanwhile, as a stock measure of the credit card business, credit
card receivables have also exhibited a broad upward trend across Asia
over the past ten years. Per capita credit card balances outstanding
grew by two to six times in these regional markets during 19982006
(Figure 10-4). By 2005, credit card receivables in Asia ranged
between 2% and 7% of their respective total bank loans outstanding
and between 3% and 15% (except for the Philippines, which reached
34.6%) of total household lending (Table 10-1). The two major
exceptions to these trends are China and India, which are the two
large emerging Asian markets with local credit card sectors still in
their infancy. They have lately been experiencing explosive growth as

5 Credit card lending can be granted by issuers through revolving credit balances,
instalments or cash lending including both cash advances and card loans. Therefore,
we also include cards that perform only the financing function, such as cash cards,
which provide specialised cash advance services to the cardholders but are not used
for purchase payments in Japan and Taiwan.

functions: payment and financing. Accordingly, credit card users gen-
erally fall into two groups: transactors, who use credit cards mostly
for payment convenience, and revolvers, who borrow regularly on
their credit cards and pay interests accordingly. Transactors typically
are of better credit, but generate limited earnings for card issuers
principally through merchant discount fees. By contrast, regular
revolvers tend to be inherently riskier personal borrowers than trans-
actors. Moreover, compared to other forms of household credit,
credit cards represent a high-yield unsecured personal lending busi-
ness, providing on average more than half of the net earnings for
credit card issuers in many Asian markets. Growing credit card lend-
ing represents new opportunities in terms of improved access to
credit and consumption smoothing by consumers, more diversified

medium household income as a denominator to better reflect the consumer indebtedness.
However, this measure is not readily available in many Asian economies, and their definitions
may vary considerably from one market to another. Hence, both data availability and compara-
bility warrant the use of GDP as our denominator in this chapter.

loan portfolios and higher margins for the financial industry, but also
increases risks to the financial system. 
Credit card balances in most Asian markets do not seem excessive
when benchmarked against the US at 7% of GDP (Table 10-1).
Nevertheless, this same measure indicates comparatively high indebt-
edness of 15% in Korea in 2002 and 9% in Taiwan in 2005.
Moreover, it is not appropriate to compare levels without taking into
account that the market is more established in the US but still devel-
oping in Asia. Systemic risks could still arise at seemingly comparable
level of credit card debts. 
The expansion of credit card balances outstanding in Asian mar-
kets has followed two distinct patterns in recent years (Table 10-2
and Figure 10-4). Credit card lending and debt in Malaysia and
Singapore has shown a relatively steady growth that might character-
ize a smooth catch-up to the scale of such receivables in relation to
household income in mature markets. In contrast, credit card lending
in Hong Kong, Korea and Taiwan has in each case exhibited large
swings of a boom-bust nature (Figure 10-5). Hence, if there is an
underlying trend in these three Asian markets towards convergence
levels prevailing in mature markets, it has certainly not been smooth.
Thailand is an interesting outlier to these two patterns  it experi-
enced explosive growth in card receivables during 20022003, but
managed to rein the lending boom to a soft landing through early
and phased regulatory responses.

Large fluctuations in credit card lending can pose systemic risks
and present challenges to the regions regulators. Behind these big
swings in credit card receivables would be costly adjustments on the
part of both card issuers and cardholders, if not investors and taxpay-
ers. More broadly, such lending booms and busts can be viewed as
part of a more general problem involving the build-up and subse-
quent unwinding of financial imbalances observed not just in
emerging Asia. The recent turmoil in the US subprime mortgage
market testifies to the need for a better understanding of potential
financial imbalance associated with excessive risky lending. These pat-
terns can have important implications for the real economy, financial
stability and in turn the design of policies and regulatory frameworks
(Borio and Lowe, 2002).
3. Three Episodes of Credit Card Lending Distress in Asia
Credit card lending distress refers to a situation of sharp asset quality
deterioration in the credit card lending portfolio, significant card
issuer losses and subsequent prolonged card lending retrenchment.
While their specific circumstances differ, the three more volatile Asian
episodes share a number of stylised characteristics to various degrees.

These include the episodes causes, mechanics and effects on the
financial system and real economy. Of the three cases, the Korean one
was the most severe and will be investigated in greater detail in
Section 4. The current section emphasises the common elements 
of these three cases of credit card lending distress  conceptually,
credit card lending cycles have two phases: the boom and the bust,
respectively. 
3.1 The boom
The boom phase was typically characterized by large increases in
credit card lending and credit availability. As a result, the stock of
credit card debt grew at a rapid pace within a short period of time.
Hong Kongs card balances increased from 3% of GDP in 1998 to 5%
in 2001. Koreas outstanding credit card debt grew most rapidly,
from 4% in 1999 to a peak of 15% by 2002. Taiwan was in between,
from 5% in 2002 to 9% in 2005. At that time, such credit card lend-
ing booms might have appeared to reflect no more than a catch-up
process. In retrospect, however, they seem to have also gone hand in
hand with a relaxation in the screening and lending standards of card
issuers amid intensified market competition. 
Six factors lay behind the relaxation of lending standards and
excessive growth in credit card lending. First, weaker corporate loan
demand, ample liquidity in the banking systems and lower interest
rates in the wake of the Asian financial crisis put pressure on lenders
to focus more on consumers. In Korea, commercial banks financed
not only their own card operations, but also the dominant monoline
credit card issuers through loans. Low interest rates at the time also
led Korean households to seek higher yields in fixed income mutual
funds of investment trust companies (ITCs), themselves overweight
in paper issued by monoline credit card companies. In a search for
yield, pension funds and insurance companies also took sizable expo-
sure to credit card companies (Park, 2007). In Hong Kong, the
depressed local real estate market at the time dampened demand for
mortgage loans (which represented some 30% of the total local loan
book) and pressured banks to seek opportunities in unsecured

personal lending. Taiwans banking system was also awash with liq-
uidity, as bank reserves in excess of the required level approached 20%
of total deposits for most of the 2000s. 
Second, during financial liberalization, there were new and often
less experienced entrants contesting these markets. These new players
intensified competition, leading to more relaxed lending standards
and stronger credit expansion (DellAriccia and Marquez, 2006). In
Hong Kong, some major foreign issuers without extensive local
branch networks tried to enter the credit card market through direct
marketing. In Taiwan, financial liberalization in the early 1990s dou-
bled the number of banks in an already crowded banking market.
These newcomers, mostly smaller private commercial banks, targeted
the under-served consumer banking business, doubling their market
share from 28% in 1994 to 56% in 2005. In Korea, tax incentives to
promote the use of credit cards prompted some chaebols, with lim-
ited consumer banking experience, to expand the business and
capture 76% of domestic card transactions by 2002. These changes in
the competitive landscape even led some dominant incumbents to
relax screening and underwriting standards.
Third, economies of scale in the credit card business might also
have contributed to competition for market share. The industry is a
scale business, involving large initial sunk costs necessary to set up the
infrastructure for data processing, credit scoring, account manage-
ment, monitoring and settlement. Moreover, the industry needs a
sufficient cardholder base to attract merchants to sign on to credit
card programmes. Hence, once the initial investment is made, the
marginal cost of adding new accounts is relatively low, reinforcing the
imperative to chase market share. Such industry and cost structures
thus tend to intensify market competition.6 All three episodes wit-
nessed aggressive and costly marketing campaigns to recruit new
294

6 According to an informal survey by the authors, the estimated break-even threshold
of cardholders for the top five Korean credit card issuers combined is about 30 mil-
lion. Setting this threshold against the fact that there are around 20 Korean credit
card issuers and a total working population of 25 million people indicates keen com-
petition for market share in Korea.

cardholders through mass mailing, telemarketing and even street
solicitation with little screening.
Fourth, a limited credit reporting and sharing infrastructure fur-
ther contributed to the excessive build-up of risks in credit card
lending portfolios. This was particularly the case at that time in Hong
Kong and Korea, where the coverage of local credit reporting systems
was limited in terms of reporting lenders, debtor base and types of
data collected (Miller, 2003; He et al., 2005; Jeong, 2006; Park,
2007). To make things even worse, the Korean government erased
half of the available personal delinquency records at the local bankers
association in May 2001 (Lee, 2005). Furthermore, some leading
local credit card issuers did not participate in the reporting system,
fearing that sharing certain customer information would reduce their
monopolistic rents of private information on their own client base.
On the other hand, Taiwans credit bureau was arguably among the
most sophisticated in the world, but the boom-bust cycle occurred
anyway.7 A well-functioning information sharing system alone is no
panacea. The situation was quite similar to the subprime woes in the
US, where the credit reporting system was well developed. 
Fifth, various forms of principal-agent problems could also aggra-
vate information asymmetry and further distort incentives. Amid
intense competition, some Taiwanese card issuers simply outsourced
the recruitment of new cardholders to so-called credit card brokers
who helped less creditworthy card applicants to polish up their
applications and simultaneously submit them to several issuers for a
fee. This effectively bypassed the local credit reporting system. Such
agency problems also happened in Korea during 20022003.
Moreover, as discussed in Section 4, Korean card issuers relied heavily
on wholesale funding to support their business and thus might be
tempted to inflate the asset quality of their card portfolio and push

7 Taiwans credit reporting system (the Joint Credit Information Centre (JCIC)) was
further undermined by the reported beggar-thy-competitor behavior of some card
issuers, who encouraged delinquent borrowers to apply for new credit cards from
other banks to repay their existing card debts in exchange for not reporting their
delinquencies to the JCIC.

risky card loans off their balance sheets to less informed third-party
investors as marketable securities (Moreno, 2006; White, 2007). This
resembled the recent experience in the US subprime mortgage mar-
ket, where responsibilities are segregated among different agents.
Without proper prudential and regulatory arrangements in place, the
originate and distribute model might weaken the incentives to
screen borrowers.
Finally, higher lending rates on a fast-growing but not well-
seasoned credit card loan portfolio initially brought about attractive net
earnings. This enticed new and incumbent card issuers to focus still
more on the card lending business. In all three cases, competition was
very intense on the lending side of the credit card business. The season-
ing effect appears to be similar to that of corporate high-yield bonds,
which tend to have low default rates in the years immediately after their
issuance with their positive cash flows. Hence, card issuers record much
higher yields initially from card lending, unless they provision explicitly
for the latent losses expected later. In Korea, cash advance fees and
interest charges exceeded 20% compared to the prevailing unsecured
personal loan rates of 67%.8 During the Korean credit card lending
boom, the share of cash lending in total credit card assets approached
65%, and the sectors average return on equity reached 40% 
(Figure 10-6). In 2001, returns on asset of the credit card companies
were six times the average of the Korean commercial banks (Yun,
2004). In Taiwans credit card industry, interest earnings and fees
related to cash advances were five times the earnings from merchant
discount fees during the lending boom; at the peak, Taiwans cash card
balance approached half of the total card receivables (Figure 10-7). 
All six factors interacted to heighten the risks of relaxing lending
standards. Through either an understatement of the lending standards
or the knowing acceptance of greater risks, the result was excessive
lending and riskier credit card loan portfolios. Moreover, there was a

that time, making card lending relatively more attractive (He et al., 2005). In
Taiwan, industry players estimate that net interest margins on card loans were at least
four times higher than those on corporate lending.

deliberate strategy to target the market segment for less prime and
higher-yielding revolvers, as credit cards have evolved from being
part of a banking package catering for high-end bank customers to
being a mainstream payment facility for occasional revolvers, and fur-
ther to a lending instrument targeting less prime regular revolvers.
Hence, competition for market share started to move rapidly down
the credit spectrum within a very short span of time.

As a consequence, there was a tendency of disproportional con-
centration of debt burdens among the less creditworthy card
borrowers who need unsecured lending the most. In Taiwan, the
outstanding balance of cash card holders, who are mostly revolvers
and thus riskier on average than credit card holders, amounted to half
the of card receivables by the late 2005. This compared to only one-
quarter in mid-2004 (Figure 10-6). In Korea, a leading local issuer
found that 70% of its bad loans came from card lending extended to
accounts acquired during 20002001, when the total number of
credit cards in the economy more than doubled. Park (2007) shows
that between 1999 and 2002, the average debt burden of asset-poor
households rose much faster than other households, with much of
the increase being unsecured credit card debt. 
As commonly happens with the boom of credit to households,
aggregate spending received a boost as well. Koreas private con-
sumption expenditure as a share of GDP jumped from 48% in 2000
to 55% in 2002, which helped to sustain the economic recovery after
the 1998 recession brought about by the Asian financial crisis. By
contrast, for Hong Kong and Taiwan, the effects of credit card lend-
ing boom on consumption were less pronounced.
3.2 The bust
The second phase of the credit card lending cycles often began with a
lagged recognition of excessive indebtedness and disproportional risk
concentration, amid rising delinquencies. This resulted in greater
caution on the part of the card issuers, tighter lending standards, con-
tractions of credit, and prolonged balance sheet adjustments, often
affecting the real side of the economy. 
Though increasing credit lines, the merry-go-round process of
some multiple credit card holders, re-aging practices among card
issuers (rollover of would-be delinquent card debt) and in some cases,
unloading card loans via securitization kept the lending boom going
for a while, but eventually some overstretched card borrowers hit lim-
its. As credit card portfolios became more seasoned, delinquency and
credit costs rose due to mounting provisions and charge-off expenses,
298

which squeezed cash flows and profit margins of card issuers. Before
long, issuers sensed trouble and became more cautious in extending
credit lines, tightening credit availability for the sector. 
Tighter credit in turn further pushed up delinquencies, especially
among overleveraged borrowers. This resulted in a scenario similar to
a credit crunch, a situation where credit contraction and deterioration
in asset quality reinforce each other. These adverse dynamics are
captured by both the rapid declines in outstanding credit card bal-
ances and sharp spikes in the impaired asset ratio defined as the 
sum of delinquencies and charge-offs over credit card receivables
(Figure 10-5).9 Korea and Taiwans impaired assets ratios approached
25% at their respective heights of the stress phase. In the two years
following their respective peaks of lending booms, Koreas card
receivables fell by 65%, compared to a decline of 30% in Taiwan and
only 10% in Hong Kong.
In response to signs of asset quality deterioration, the authorities
tightened rules. Examples included the establishment of a more
inclusive credit reference agency in Hong Kong (He et al., 2005) and
stronger write-off and disclosure requirements in Taiwan. The
Korean authorities first upgraded credit card asset classification stan-
dards, strengthened provision requirements, started applying prompt
corrective action to standalone card issuers, and raised their minimum
capital adequacy ratio from 7% to 8%. They also banned aggressive
marketing practices and introduced a new rule capping cash lending
balances below 50% of total credit card assets (the so-called 50%
rule). While probably healthy from a longer-term perspective or
deployed in advance, in the shorter term, some of these measures
risked additional contractionary effects on card issuers and borrowers,
thereby exacerbating the credit crunch as the cycles turned. 
In each case, as the situation worsened, policy interventions
shifted more towards crisis management, often in the forms of regula-
tory forbearance for issuers and debt rehabilitation for overleveraged

9 As write-off rules vary across markets and over time, a better way to capture the
asset quality of credit loan portfolio would be the impaired assets that comprise both
delinquency and charge-off.

cardholders. All three cases witnessed personal debt workout pro-
grammes with rising defaults and bankruptcy (Figure 10-8). In
Korea, a credit counselling and recovery service programme was
set up in October 2002 to facilitate debt rescheduling. In Taiwan, to
facilitate renegotiation between issuers and multiple-card debtors, the
authorities set up a personal debt restructuring platform, covering
some 30% of total card balances. One-third of the restructured
debtors were reportedly performing at the time, but enrolled in the
programme nevertheless to take advantage of better repayment
terms.10 Restructured loans were reclassified as performing, effectively
granting issuers regulatory forbearance. In Korea, the authorities
reversed some earlier tough measures and allowed issuers to roll over
delinquent credit card loans, a practice known as re-aging. This
eased, at least temporarily, the burden of provisions and charge-offs on
issuers, again providing de facto regulatory forbearance.

The cleaning-up processes in the three episodes all witnessed
protracted contraction in credit card receivables and heavy losses suf-
fered by card issuers but differed in the role of the government.
Hong Kongs consolidation following the turning of the lending
cycle was mostly driven by market, with the exit of a key credit card
issuer (and also a new entrant at the start of the local credit card
lending cycle) through the sales of its entire card business and book
to another key local market player. In Korea and Taiwan, both the
market and government played some role. Almost one-third of
Taiwans 34 cash card issuers closed down, as a number of local and
foreign card issuers quitted the local market, with ABN AMRO sell-
ing its whole TWD 8 billion worth credit card portfolio in Taiwan.
On the other hand, the Korean government, through the state-
owned Korea Development Bank, intervened and coordinated a
rescue package for the troubled leading local credit card company.
Finally, as discussed, regulatory forbearance of one form or another
was applied in Korea and Taiwan.
The effects of these lending boom-bust episodes on the financial
system varied, depending on the scale of the initial excess and on pol-
icy responses, but in each case, the damage was manageable. Leading
issuers often suffered heavy losses from their card lending business, as
one-third of the entire card lending books at their peaks eventually
had to be written off. The lending boom in Korea was the most spec-
tacular; so was its subsequent bust. Although credit card lending
normally amounted to less than 10% of the total loan books in these
banking systems, Koreas credit card balances for both bank and
monoline issuers were equivalent to as much as one-fifth of total bank
loans outstanding at the peak of the boom. Moreover, commercial
banks themselves were heavily exposed to monoline credit card
issuers. As of March 2003, Korean commercial banks lending to the
troubled LG Card was KRW 11.2 trillion, or 38% of the creditor
banks combined capital. The overall exposure of commercial banks
to the card issuers reached KRW 22 trillion on the eve of the crisis
(Park, 2007). Credit card debt distress further fuelled broad disrup-
tive contagion in Korean financial markets, indirectly contributing to
weaker corporate capital spending into 2004.

The unwinding of the earlier excess lending sometimes also inter-
twined with and even exacerbated ongoing local business down
cycles. During 19972001, Hong Kongs prolonged housing price
deflation led to negative equity for many mortgagers who had to turn
more to unsecured lending; rising local unemployment weakened the
repayment ability of borrowers; a new generous personal bankruptcy
regime in 1998 interacted to further accentuate the excess 
lending boom and its subsequent bust. As a result, both credit card
charge-off and personal bankruptcies reached historical heights in
2002 (Figure 10-9). At the height of the card lending distress, the
average debt burden of Hong Kong borrowers was about two times
the monthly income while in the US, it was six; yet, this average debt
multiple for Hong Kongs personal bankruptcy petitioners exceeded
40 times in 2002, which was twice that in the US. In Korea, the
downturn around late 2000 further weakened the households ability
to service debts (Park, 2007). Yet in Taiwan, there was no evidence
that business cycles triggered the bubble burst.
Finally, rising delinquencies impacted the real economies via
weakened consumer spending. Worsening asset quality, funding diffi-
culties and tougher regulations reinforced credit contractions and 
led to a credit crunch in some cases. The more disorderly unwinding
in Korea visibly led the private consumption downturn in 2003

(Figure 10-10). By contrast, credit card woes in Hong Kong were
overshadowed by and perhaps mixed up with the protracted local
asset price deflation at the time (Lai and Lam, 2002) and seemed to
dampen the spending on big-ticket items in Taiwan after 2004. 
4. The Korean Credit Card Market
The Korean experience has attracted most attention (Kang and Ma,
2007, ADB, 2007). This section examines some key characteristics of
the 2003 Korean crisis and uses the firm-level panel data to shed light
on the role of card lending in shaping the quality of overall credit
card assets. 
4.1 The 2003 credit card crisis
Our closer examination of the Korean case highlights three points.
First, government policies played a prominent role at the start of the
lending boom. Nevertheless, the role of the tax incentive scheme
should not be overstated. Second, since the monoline card issuers
dominated the industry, the credit card crisis spilled over into the cap-
ital market and led to contagion. Finally, the crisis involved
institutional support for a troubled leading credit card issuer that was
not a bank via a mixed public-private rescue operation.

Government policies designed to cushion the economic downturn
after the Asian financial crisis contributed to the Korean credit card
lending boom of 19992002. The policy package included tax benefits
for merchants accepting credit cards and income tax deductions linked
to card purchases.11 On the regulatory front, the authorities abolished
the ceiling of KRW 700,000 ($610) on monthly cash advances and
removed the limit of the leverage (up to 20 times capital) on card
issuers. Moreover, the weighted regulatory capital requirement for the
specialty issuers was only 7% despite the inherently undiversified nature
of their unsecured lending business. Such policy measures spurred card
companies to embark on an aggressive campaign into the lucrative cash
lending business. In response, the market grew rapidly in 19992002,
with the number of credit cards rising from 40 million to 100 million
and the total credit card assets expanding five-fold (Figure 10-5). 
Although the tax incentives might had indeed stimulated credit
card spending and made the Korean case special, one should not exag-
gerate their role. First, for card holders, issuers and merchants alike,
the tax incentives applied only to credit card purchases and not to
credit card cash advances. It was precisely cash advances that got out
of control during 20012002. Second, to the extent that the bulk of
the increased credit card spending represented a simple substitution
for cash spending, the household ability to service debt should not be
materially compromised. Third, even if some cardholders might have
overspent to take advantage of tax benefits, other available unsecured
personal loans attracted only 7% to 9% interest charges, compared to
the prevailing 20% APR on credit cards. Fourth, the riskier households
should generally be much less motivated to take advantage of income
304
Asia and China in the Global Economy
11 The tax incentive scheme works as follows. A cardholders income tax deduction,
which is [credit card purchase  (annual income*15%)]*15%, is subject to a maxi-
mum tax deduction of the lesser of either 20% of annual income or five million won.
The 15% is a policy control variable. A merchants tax deduction was set at 1% of the
card transaction amount, subject to a maximum tax deduction of five million won.
For example, assume a cardholder with an annual income of 30 million wons, credit
card purchase of 9 million wons, and a flat income tax rate of 14.1%. Her tax saving
via credit card purchase will be 95,175 wons = 14.1%*[9mn  30mn* 15%)*15%].

tax deduction, as the marginal income tax rates for the lower income
brackets are only 8% to 17%. Finally, income tax deduction related to
card purchase is still available today, albeit down from 20% in 1999 to
15%. In sum, we doubt tax incentives were a principal cause behind
Koreas 2003 credit card lending boom. 
The business model adopted by Korean card issuers had also
helped shape the particular dynamics of the local credit card lending
distress. This was because of interactions between asset quality deterio-
ration and funding difficulties (Figure 10-11). Specialised credit card
service providers dominated the Korean market but were prevented by
regulation from deposit-taking. Hence, during the boom, monoline
issuers funded the credit expansion by tapping the capital market, with
debentures, commercial papers or credit card ABS they issued being
purchased by ITCs, insurance companies and pension funds. However,
as their card portfolios began to turn sour, spooked investors rushed to
pull their investments out of ITC-managed funds. Panic redemptions
even forced ITCs to sell their government bond holdings as liquidity in
the secondary corporate bond markets disappeared (Lee and Kim,
2005). In a matter of two weeks, the outstanding value of the ITC-
managed funds fell by 15%. Most card companies found it almost
impossible to roll over their maturing debts. Funding difficulties also
forced issuers to slow or even cut their lending to cardholders, further

pushing up delinquencies and hurting the confidence of bond
investors. Heavy reliance on wholesale funding thus subjected the
Korean card issuers to sudden seize up in the financial market at a time
when the asset quality of their card lending portfolio was deteriorating. 
Two lessons can be highlighted from the business model of
monoline credit card operations based on wholesale funding. Firstly,
the Korean business model resembles an originate and distribute
type, which has come under criticism in the wake of the recent US
subprime mortgage crisis. This model might encourage regulatory
arbitrage and laxer underwriting standards. In addition, through
securitization, monoline credit card companies got around the regu-
lation that a credit card company is not allowed to issue debenture
over ten times of its capital. Furthermore, the widespread re-aging
practice among card issuers inflated asset quality of their card lending
and facilitated the transfer of credit risks to distant securities
investors, further reducing transparency and weakening the incentives
to screen and monitor card applicants. Re-aging also delayed the
recognition of the problem and allowed excessive accumulation of
risk during the lending boom phase. FSS and Goldman Sachs (2003)
estimated that re-aged loans of the top eight Korean credit card com-
panies might amount to 30% of their total assets at the end of 2003. 
A second lesson is that market discipline seemed to have failed.
Given that the credit card portfolio typically represented about 5% of
the total bank loan book, one may argue that yield spreads of bonds
issued by commercial banks might not widen sufficiently and early
enough to signal the rising risk. However, in Korea, the bond market
failed to price such credit risks even as the quality of monoline issuers
portfolio deteriorated sharply until the full crisis broke out in March
2003 (Park and Lee, 2003). Between January 2002 and February
2003, the yield spread of card company bonds over three-year govern-
ment bond and the benchmark corporate bonds of comparable rating
widened by less than 50 basis points (Figure 10-12).12 This might
306
Asia and China in the Global Economy
12 Park et al. (2003) also report that the yield spread of credit card company bonds
over government bonds was insensitive to the delinquency in the monoline issuers
card portfolios until it was too late.

have encouraged the aggressive balance sheet expansion of credit card
companies longer than otherwise in a time when credit risk was rapidly
building up. Such a lack of effective market discipline can be viewed as
a particular case of market failure due to information asymmetry,
which in turn might be related to the regulatory authorities belated
disclosure of information about card companies to the public and per-
mission of the re-aging practice as well as the opaque and excessive
complex structure of some ABS deals (Moreno, 2006). Finally, the
failure of the domestic rating agencies to promptly review the bonds
and ABS issues of credit card companies certainly did not help. 
As the turmoil spread to the bond market, policy intervention
came to resemble crisis management operations more. This policy
change was a response to the perception of higher systemic risks,
though the extent to which a problem existed remains a matter for
debate. Policymakers also shifted their tactics over time, opting to
intervene firstly by providing liquidity support to both the financial
market in general and to troubled credit card issuers in particular, and
secondly by arranging a controversy rescue of the failing LG Card.
These two forms of government intervention were large-scale.
First, within days of the mid-March 2003 bond market sell-off, the
Bank of Korea (BoK) acted to inject substantial short-term liquidity
into the system through open market operations. The BoKs liquidity
injection via reverse repos, outright purchases of the government

bonds and early redemption of Monetary Stabilisation Bonds was on
the scale of KRW 4 trillion. The government also persuaded investors
to roll over the matured debts of card companies. 
Second was a package arranged by the government through the
state-owned Korean Development Bank (KDB) to rescue the trou-
bled LG Card. The authorities initially pressured the majority
shareholders of troubled ard company to inject capital (in the order
of KRW 4.6 trillion), then suspended the trading of LG Card bonds,
arranged the KDB to extend new credit to LG Card, and eventually
coordinated a debt-equity swaps to ensure the joint control of LG
Card by the creditor banks in 2004. At the peak, the KDB lending
alone exceeded a quarter of the KRW 3.7 trillion total creditor 
claims on LG Card. The KDB-led creditor committee seized the
management control of LG Card. During the restructuring process,
the entire equity of LG Cards majority shareholders was wiped out,
while that of the minority shareholders was substantially written
down, which should help contain the moral hazard risk.13 The credi-
tor banks eventually recorded an accounting profit of KRW 3 trillion
from the debt-equity swap in March 2007 when Shinhan Bank
acquired LG Card through a public takeover bid. As a result, the res-
cue of LG Card did not cost taxpayers money. On the other hand, as
public sector resources and implicit government guarantees were
obviously involved upfront, the KDBs involvement ex ante entailed a
rise in the governments contingent liability at the time. Therefore,
the institutional support for LG Card could be viewed as a joint
private-public sector rescue characterized by a mixture of both
bail-out and bail-in (Eichengreen and Ruehl, 2000).

minority shareholders who exchanged 240 of their old shares for one share in the

who chose not to participate in the swap would agree to extend the maturity of their
claims for one or two years in return for a premium of 200300 bps over the prevail-
ing yields on the benchmark 3-year AA- corporate bonds.

An important question regarding the 2003 Korean credit card crisis
concerns whether and to what extent levels of credit card cash advances
affect asset quality of card lending portfolios for a number of reasons.
First, it was the credit card lending boom that led to the painful bust,
wherein cash advances likely played a central role. Second, revolvers
tend to be less creditworthy, thus the level of cash advances itself may
adversely affect the asset quality of credit card portfolios. Third, though
the seasoning effect in credit card lending might initially boost earnings
for issuers, higher levels of cash advances would lead to increased riski-
ness of the card portfolio. The null hypothesis is that higher levels of
cash advances, if properly lagged, will worsen the asset quality. 
We use firm-level panel data to estimate the following equations and
test whether lagged cash advances affect the credit card asset quality.
Y = β1X1 + β2X2 + β3X3 + α0
(1)
Y = β1X1 + β 2X2 + β3X3 + α0 + α1Z1 + α2Z2 + α3Z3
(2)
where Y is an asset quality indicator, which could be either delin-
quency, charge-off or impaired asset that combines delinquency and
charge-off. In Equation (1), asset quality is a function of the lagged
cash advances: X1, X2 and X3 are cash advance share of the total card
billing lagged in two, three and four quarters  the key explanatory
variables of our interest. We expect the estimated coefficient β to be
positive. In Equation (2), we introduce three control variables (Z1, Z2
and Z3): log of total credit card asset, capital adequacy ratio and
return on assets at credit card companies. To avoid endogeneity, all of
the Xi and Zi are lagged at least two quarters or more.14
We find strong evidence of bigger cash lending hurting asset quality
(Table 10-3). In particular, cash advances lagged two and three quarters
appear to be two major determinants of the quality of credit card assets.
This confirms that excessive cash lending and deliberate targeting by

defined as at least three months overdue, the regressors need to be lagged for two

credit card companies of the market segment of less prime cardholders
(the revolvers) in 20002002 resulted in riskier card portfolios, poorer
asset quality and eventually credit loss. As to possible seasoning effects,
we find on average a lag of two to three quarters between cash advances
and the actual delinquency and write-off. In between, credit card
companies continued lending aggressively. One implication is that

required provisioning for cash lending might be insufficient to fully
reflect possible credit loss. In sum, our findings confirm the central role
of excessive cash lending in the Korean credit card crisis. 
5. Lessons Learned and Policy Implications
These three episodes of credit card lending distress point to a number
of lessons which may be valuable to policymakers in other Asian mar-
kets that are starting to experience a rapid expansion in credit card
lending. Indeed, policymakers in other Asian markets have already
taken notice of the three Asian episodes and some have responded
accordingly. Given the limited space, this chapter mainly focuses on
the following three policy lessons.
First, the episodes highlight the importance of placing greater
emphasis on detecting early warning signs before imbalances build up
excessively for too long. Admittedly, it is a challenge to sound the
alarm bell when profits are on the rise, amid a lending boom.
However, reasonable average debt-to-GDP or liability-to-asset ratios
and low initial losses should not give rise to complacency. 
For instance, while Koreas household financial liability-to-asset ratio
during the 20002002 card lending boom pointed to potential trou-
bles ahead, the same ratio simply failed to alert in Taiwans case
(Table 10-4). Even from a low base, the rapid growth in indebtedness

itself may overwhelm risk management capacity, especially during
periods marked by structural change. Nor should a benign economic
environment lead to the conclusion that a consumer debt crisis will
not occur. Moreover, given the time lags in data collection, problem
recognition, and policy response, there is probably a need to
strengthen the capacity of policymakers to conduct on-site examina-
tions and to maintain access to confidential information, particularly
in the transition phases of market development. 
Second, governments can help enhance information flows to
facilitate the functioning of the consumer credit market. For example,
to mitigate information asymmetries between lenders and borrowers,
credit information reporting and sharing should be encouraged
(Miller, 2003). Since the recent episodes of distress, credit reporting
and sharing in both Hong Kong and Korea have improved consider-
ably. Three private credit bureaus are now competing against each
other in Korea as they started collecting more positive credit data
since 2004. With the local monetary authority taking a strong lead in
overcoming legal barriers and urging greater cooperation among the
banking community, a central consumer credit information service
providing both negative and positive information in Hong Kong has
been operating since 2003 (He et al., 2005). Even in Taiwan, the
local system has been further refined and enhanced after the 2006
boom-bust. 
Going forward, credit information sharing will become an even
more important part of the financial market infrastructure as credit
cards are increasingly being offered to a wider population base in
emerging Asian markets. Credit reference agencies with a broad 
coverage of both the financial sector and types of credit data should
in general help contain adverse selection problems, improve risk man-
agement, provide more reliable warning signals to regulators and
permit more efficient product innovation and credit pricing. In
recent years, many Asian markets feature at least one leading local
credit reference agency sharing negative and positive credit data. In
particular, the credit reporting system operated by the central bank in
Malaysia allows the whole banking sector to share the positive and
negative credit information. Nevertheless, it will take time to build an

effective consumer credit database and functioning credit reporting
business. Moreover, the episode in Taiwan and the more recent prob-
lems in the US subprime mortgage market suggest that credit
reporting itself is no guarantee of safety and that careful consideration
should be given to how best to maintain the integrity of credit infor-
mation sharing and reporting systems.
Finally, policymakers may find it helpful to upgrade their pruden-
tial and supervisory frameworks, especially during the liberalization
process. These include both general regulatory rules as well as guide-
lines on best practices and prudential rules specific to the credit card
business (Table 10-5). For instance, there may be a case for more
refined and differentiated provisioning requirements for credit card
receivables: lending to regular revolvers is a higher-yield but riskier
and more volatile business, while income from transactors is lower-
margin but more stable. There should also be explicit capital
requirement as a cushion for the retained exposure or the contingent
liability arising from off-balance sheet securitization. Often, income
tests, credit limits and minimum repayment requirements are
imposed to cap risk exposure to the less prime segment of the 
credit card market. Sometimes informally put in place, some of these
more paternalistic rules can be helpful safeguards, at least during
the difficult transition periods of rapid structural changes and finan-
cial liberalization. Furthermore, these restrictions need to be
deployed pre-emptively or sufficiently early in order to enhance
financial stability. 
Forms of such restrictions have indeed been strengthened or rein-
troduced in some Asian markets following the recent distress
episodes. For example, drawing lessons from the Korean experience,
and in response to a marked acceleration in local credit card lending
during 20012003, the Thai regulators promptly introduced formal
guidelines on credit card operations in 2002 and tightened them in
2004 (Watanagase, 2005). In 2002, the Bank of Thailand (BoT) set
the minimum annual income requirement of THB180,000 for card-
holders and a 5% minimum monthly repayment of the total credit
card balance outstanding. In 2004, the BoT acted again to set a
credit limit that was five times that of monthly income, hike the

minimum monthly repayment to 10% and request mandatory cancel-
lation of credit cards in case of overdue for more than three months.
In 2007, the BoT raised the regulatory ceiling on credit card charges
to 20% from 18% APR. Largely owing to these BoT moves,
Thailands credit card balance outstanding decelerated sharply, from a
worrisome peak of 80% growth in mid-2003 to below 10% by the late

2007 (Figure 10-13). There was some deterioration in the asset qual-
ity of credit card lending, but Thailand had managed to avoid a
painful bust. Similarly, Bank Indonesia also took note of the Korean
credit card crisis and responded in 2005 by enhancing regulations
requiring a minimum monthly repayment of 10% of the credit card
balance outstanding.
Other regulations, however, may be more ambiguous in their
effect. For instance, excessively binding legal or regulatory ceilings on
lending rates may drive some borrowers away from the formal sector
and weaken card issuers ability to absorb shocks in times of distress.
This is more so, considering that credit card lending is a high-yield
retail lending business. Instead of regulatory interest rate ceilings, a
better approach for consumer protection would be mandatory stan-
dard disclosure of interest rate and fee charges as well as positive
credit data sharing and tiered interest charges to ease rates for the
majority of creditworthy cardholders. In Asia, legal ceilings on inter-
est rates on consumer finance range from 18% in Malaysia, 20% in
Taiwan and Thailand, 40% in Korea to 60% in Hong Kong.
Sometimes, informal caps on interest rates could be much lower than
the formal legal ceilings. In the Philippines, the local regulatory ceil-
ings on interest rates have been lifted since the 1980s so that higher
card rates mostly reflect higher credit costs on card lending. Most
Philippine card issuers currently charge some 30% APR and seem to

6. Conclusions
This decade has witnessed strong growth in credit card balances in
many Asian markets, as some of the potentially biggest credit card
markets in the world such China and India are also showing early
signs of take-off. Meanwhile, some of these markets have experienced
episodes of credit card lending booms and busts. The boom phase of
these cycles is often associated with increased liquidity and competi-
tion for market share, laxer lending standards, excess credit expansion
and adverse selection; the subsequent bust phase is sometimes exacer-
bated by the adverse dynamics of contracting credit, liquidity squeeze
and moral hazard. Rising levels, rapid growth and shifting distribu-
tion of household debt may all pose risks to the regions financial
systems. The dominant role of excessive cash lending is highlighted in
all the three recent episodes of credit card lending boom-bust cycles
in Asia. 
With deregulation and growing consumer finance, policymakers
need to appreciate the risks arising from consumer lending, and put in

place appropriate prudential and supervisory measures to contain risks.
Policymakers need to deploy these measures pre-emptively, ahead of
anticipated structural changes and deregulation, as well as lay greater
emphasis on both identifying indicators of excessive credit growth and
reacting to them. Furthermore, adequate market infrastructure for risk
management and information sharing is needed for a healthy con-
sumer lending market by mitigating the problem of information
asymmetry. Nevertheless, some regulations may be counterproductive
to the development of this high-yield retail lending sector. Finally,
credit bureaus may help, but careful attention must also be paid to
their operations, as well as to the incentives needed to maintain their
integrity, especially in times of easy liquidity, increased market compe-
tition, rapid structural changes and fast financial innovation.
