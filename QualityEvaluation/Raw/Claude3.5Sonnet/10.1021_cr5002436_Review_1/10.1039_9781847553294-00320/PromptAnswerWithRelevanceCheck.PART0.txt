Read the questions and answers provided below. First, critically assess the overall relevance of the answers provided to the set of questions asked.

If, upon your assessment, you find that the answers do not contain information that is relevant to the questions asked, stop your review process immediately and respond with a single sentence: "※※※※※※※The provided answers are not relevant to the questions.※※※※※※※". Do not provide any additional explanation or background information, only this sentence should be given as a response in case of irrelevant answers.

If, however, the answers are relevant to the questions asked, proceed to compile answers for each question according to the instructions below. Ensure to aggregate all the relevant answers from the multiple answer results provided in the document, and organize them sequentially by their order number, compiling the corresponding quotes, English answers, and Chinese answers for each question.

If the provided answers' quotes are not differentiated by question, ensure to break them down and assign the quotes to each respective question, outputting them separately within each question's section.

To provide a comprehensive review, differentiate the responses into quotes, English answers, and Chinese answers for each question based on the details given in the 'Answer' XML tags. Structure your review using the XML format showcased below if the answers are relevant to the questions asked:

<questions>

Compare and contrast the noble metal-based catalysts (particularly Platinum) and metal oxide-based catalysts (such as CrOx, gallium, indium, vanadium, zinc, and molybdenum oxides) used in the nonoxidative dehydrogenation of light olefins. Discuss their compositions, effectiveness, industrial applications, recent developments, and potential advantages in the field.

<EnglishVersionAnswer>

The given scientific literature does not contain any information about noble metal-based catalysts or metal oxide-based catalysts used in the nonoxidative dehydrogenation of light olefins. The document primarily discusses turnover frequencies in metal catalysis, focusing on reactions such as methanation, methanol synthesis, ethane hydrogenolysis, and ammonia synthesis. It does not cover the specific catalysts or processes mentioned in the question. Therefore, I cannot provide a comparison or discussion of the compositions, effectiveness, industrial applications, recent developments, or potential advantages of these catalysts in the field of light olefin dehydrogenation based on the information provided in this document.

The given scientific literature does not contain any information about noble metal-based catalysts or metal oxide-based catalysts used in the nonoxidative dehydrogenation of light olefins. The document appears to focus on turnover frequencies in metal catalysis, particularly for reactions like methanation, methanol synthesis, ethane hydrogenolysis, and ammonia synthesis. It does not discuss dehydrogenation catalysts or compare platinum with metal oxide catalysts. Therefore, I cannot answer this question based on the provided information.
