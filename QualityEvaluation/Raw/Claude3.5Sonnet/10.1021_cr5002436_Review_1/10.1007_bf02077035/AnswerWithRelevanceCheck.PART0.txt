          [1] "Bimetallic Pt-Sn and Pt-Pb catalysts often axe proposed for an improvement of the monometallic Pt/AI2Oa reforming catalyst."

          [2] "With increasing amounts of Pb or Sn the weak adsorption of hydrogen decreases, the adsorption of oxygen increases and the activity in the dehydrogenation of cyclohexane decreases."

          [3] "The reason of the strongly influenced adsorption capacity of Pt in bimetallic catalysts should be a chemical modification of Pt by Pb or Sn according to a tgand effect."

          [4] "Electronic interactions between Pt and Sn ]1/ and Pt and Pb 16] have been observed in spectroscopic investigations."

          [5] "Small amounts of Sn poison stronger than Pb."

          [6] "The decreasing low temperature adsorption could be explained in different ways. The dissociative adsorption of hydrogen could become a more and more activated process with increasing anounts of the second metal"

          The provided literature focuses primarily on platinum-based bimetallic catalysts (Pt-Sn and Pt-Pb) for dehydrogenation reactions, particularly the dehydrogenation of cyclohexane. It does not provide information on metal oxide-based catalysts such as CrOx, gallium, indium, vanadium, zinc, and molybdenum oxides for light olefin dehydrogenation.

          Composition: The catalysts consist of platinum with added lead or tin, supported on alumina (Al2O3).

          Effectiveness: Bimetallic Pt-Sn and Pt-Pb catalysts are proposed as improvements over monometallic Pt/Al2O3 reforming catalysts. However, increasing amounts of Pb or Sn decrease the catalytic activity for cyclohexane dehydrogenation. Small amounts of Sn have a stronger poisoning effect than Pb.

          Mechanism: The addition of Pb or Sn modifies Pt through a ligand effect, influencing its adsorption capacity. With increasing amounts of Pb or Sn, weak hydrogen adsorption decreases while oxygen adsorption increases. Electronic interactions between Pt and Sn, as well as Pt and Pb, have been observed through spectroscopic investigations.

          The literature does not provide information on the industrial applications, recent developments, or potential advantages of these catalysts in the field of light olefin dehydrogenation. It also does not compare these noble metal-based catalysts to metal oxide-based catalysts for this specific application, making a comprehensive comparison impossible based solely on this information.

          提供的文献主要关注铂基双金属催化剂（Pt-Sn和Pt-Pb）在脱氢反应中的应用，特别是环己烷的脱氢反应。它没有提供关于CrOx、镓、铟、钒、锌和钼氧化物等金属氧化物催化剂在轻烯烃脱氢中的信息。

          组成：催化剂由铂和添加的铅或锡组成，以氧化铝（Al2O3）为载体。

          有效性：双金属Pt-Sn和Pt-Pb催化剂被提议作为单金属Pt/Al2O3重整催化剂的改进。然而，随着Pb或Sn含量的增加，环己烷脱氢的催化活性降低。少量的Sn具有比Pb更强的毒化作用。

          机理：Pb或Sn的添加通过配体效应修饰Pt，影响其吸附能力。随着Pb或Sn含量的增加，弱氢气吸附减少，而氧气吸附增加。通过光谱研究观察到了Pt与Sn以及Pt与Pb之间的电子相互作用。

          文献没有提供这些催化剂在轻烯烃脱氢领域的工业应用、最新发展或潜在优势的信息。它也没有将这些贵金属基催化剂与金属氧化物基催化剂在这一特定应用中进行比较，因此仅基于这些信息无法进行全面的比较。
