[1] "Bimetallic Pt-Sn and Pt-Pb catalysts often axe proposed for an improvement of the monometallic Pt/AI2Oa reforming catalyst."

[2] "With increasing amounts of Pb or Sn the weak adsorption of hydrogen decreases, the adsorption of oxygen increases and the activity in the dehydrogenation of cyclohexane decreases."

[3] "The reason of the strongly influenced adsorption capacity of Pt in bimetallic catalysts should be a chemical modification of Pt by Pb or Sn according to a tgand effect."

[4] "With increasing addition of Pb or Sn the rate of dehydrogenation is decreased and the activation energy increases. Small amounts of Sn poison stronger than Pb."

The literature primarily focuses on Platinum-based bimetallic catalysts (Pt-Sn and Pt-Pb) for the dehydrogenation of cyclohexane, which is not directly comparable to the nonoxidative dehydrogenation of light olefins using metal oxide-based catalysts. The document does not provide information on CrOx, gallium, indium, vanadium, zinc, or molybdenum oxide catalysts.

For Pt-based catalysts, the study shows that:

1. Bimetallic Pt-Sn and Pt-Pb catalysts are proposed to improve monometallic Pt/Al2O3 reforming catalysts.

2. Increasing amounts of Pb or Sn decrease weak hydrogen adsorption and dehydrogenation activity, while increasing oxygen adsorption.

3. The addition of Pb or Sn chemically modifies Pt through a ligand effect, influencing its adsorption capacity.

4. Increasing Pb or Sn content decreases the dehydrogenation rate and increases activation energy, with small amounts of Sn having a stronger poisoning effect than Pb.

The document does not provide information on the industrial applications, recent developments, or potential advantages of these catalysts in the field of light olefin dehydrogenation. It also lacks information on metal oxide-based catalysts, making a comprehensive comparison impossible based solely on this literature.

该文献主要关注铂基双金属催化剂（Pt-Sn和Pt-Pb）用于环己烷脱氢，这与使用金属氧化物基催化剂进行轻烯烃非氧化脱氢不能直接比较。文献未提供关于CrOx、镓、铟、钒、锌或钼氧化物催化剂的信息。

对于Pt基催化剂，研究表明：

1. 双金属Pt-Sn和Pt-Pb催化剂被提议用来改进单金属Pt/Al2O3重整催化剂。

2. 增加Pb或Sn的含量会降低弱氢吸附和脱氢活性，同时增加氧气吸附。

3. 添加Pb或Sn通过配体效应化学改性Pt，影响其吸附能力。

4. 增加Pb或Sn含量会降低脱氢速率并增加活化能，少量Sn的毒化作用比Pb更强。

文献没有提供这些催化剂在轻烯烃脱氢领域的工业应用、最新发展或潜在优势的信息。它也缺乏关于金属氧化物基催化剂的信息，因此仅基于这篇文献无法进行全面比较。
