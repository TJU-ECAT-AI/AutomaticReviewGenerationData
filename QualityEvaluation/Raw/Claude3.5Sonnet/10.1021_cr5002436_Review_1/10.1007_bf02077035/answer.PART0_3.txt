[1] "Bimetallic Pt-Sn and Pt-Pb catalysts often axe proposed for an improvement of the monometallic Pt/AI2Oa reforming catalyst."

[2] "With increasing amounts of Pb or Sn the weak adsorption of hydrogen decreases, the adsorption of oxygen increases and the activity in the dehydrogenation of cyclohexane decreases."

[3] "The reason of the strongly influenced adsorption capacity of Pt in bimetallic catalysts should be a chemical modification of Pt by Pb or Sn according to a tgand effect."

[4] "Small amounts of Sn poison stronger than Pb."

The literature does not provide sufficient information to fully compare and contrast noble metal-based catalysts (particularly Platinum) with metal oxide-based catalysts for the nonoxidative dehydrogenation of light olefins. The text focuses primarily on bimetallic Pt-Sn and Pt-Pb catalysts for cyclohexane dehydrogenation, which is not directly related to light olefin dehydrogenation.

From the limited information provided, we can infer that:

1. Platinum-based catalysts, particularly bimetallic Pt-Sn and Pt-Pb catalysts, are used in reforming processes, which may include dehydrogenation reactions.

2. The addition of Sn or Pb to Pt catalysts affects their performance in dehydrogenation reactions, generally decreasing activity.

3. The modification of Pt with Sn or Pb alters the catalyst's adsorption properties, which impacts its effectiveness in dehydrogenation.

4. Small amounts of Sn have a stronger poisoning effect than Pb on Pt catalysts.

However, the document does not provide information on metal oxide-based catalysts or their comparison with noble metal catalysts for light olefin dehydrogenation. It also lacks details on industrial applications, recent developments, and potential advantages of these catalysts in the field.

该文献没有提供足够的信息来全面比较和对比贵金属基催化剂（特别是铂）与金属氧化物基催化剂在轻烯烃非氧化脱氢中的应用。文本主要关注双金属Pt-Sn和Pt-Pb催化剂在环己烷脱氢中的应用，这与轻烯烃脱氢不直接相关。

从提供的有限信息中，我们可以推断：

1. 铂基催化剂，特别是双金属Pt-Sn和Pt-Pb催化剂，在重整过程中使用，可能包括脱氢反应。

2. 向Pt催化剂中添加Sn或Pb会影响其在脱氢反应中的性能，通常会降低活性。

3. 用Sn或Pb对Pt的修饰改变了催化剂的吸附性质，这影响了其在脱氢中的有效性。

4. 少量的Sn对Pt催化剂的毒化作用比Pb更强。

然而，该文档没有提供关于金属氧化物基催化剂的信息，也没有比较它们与贵金属催化剂在轻烯烃脱氢中的应用。它也缺乏这些催化剂在该领域的工业应用、最新发展和潜在优势的详细信息。
