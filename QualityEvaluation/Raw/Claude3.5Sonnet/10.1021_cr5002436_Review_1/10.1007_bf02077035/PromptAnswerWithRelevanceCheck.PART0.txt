[1] "Bimetallic Pt-Sn and Pt-Pb catalysts often axe proposed for an improvement of the monometallic Pt/AI2Oa reforming catalyst."

[2] "With increasing amounts of Pb or Sn the weak adsorption of hydrogen decreases, the adsorption of oxygen increases and the activity in the dehydrogenation of cyclohexane decreases."

[3] "The reason of the strongly influenced adsorption capacity of Pt in bimetallic catalysts should be a chemical modification of Pt by Pb or Sn according to a tgand effect."

[4] "With increasing addition of Pb or Sn the rate of dehydrogenation is decreased and the activation energy increases. Small amounts of Sn poison stronger than Pb."

</quotes>

<EnglishVersionAnswer>

The literature primarily focuses on Platinum-based bimetallic catalysts (Pt-Sn and Pt-Pb) for the dehydrogenation of cyclohexane, which is not directly comparable to the nonoxidative dehydrogenation of light olefins using metal oxide-based catalysts. The document does not provide information on CrOx, gallium, indium, vanadium, zinc, or molybdenum oxide catalysts.

For Pt-based catalysts, the study shows that:

1. Bimetallic Pt-Sn and Pt-Pb catalysts are proposed to improve monometallic Pt/Al2O3 reforming catalysts.

2. Increasing amounts of Pb or Sn decrease weak hydrogen adsorption and dehydrogenation activity, while increasing oxygen adsorption.

3. The addition of Pb or Sn chemically modifies Pt through a ligand effect, influencing its adsorption capacity.

4. Increasing Pb or Sn content decreases the dehydrogenation rate and increases activation energy, with small amounts of Sn having a stronger poisoning effect than Pb.

The document does not provide information on the industrial applications, recent developments, or potential advantages of these catalysts in the field of light olefin dehydrogenation. It also lacks information on metal oxide-based catalysts, making a comprehensive comparison impossible based solely on this literature.

该文献主要关注铂基双金属催化剂（Pt-Sn和Pt-Pb）用于环己烷脱氢，这与使用金属氧化物基催化剂进行轻烯烃非氧化脱氢不能直接比较。文献未提供关于CrOx、镓、铟、钒、锌或钼氧化物催化剂的信息。

对于Pt基催化剂，研究表明：

1. 双金属Pt-Sn和Pt-Pb催化剂被提议用来改进单金属Pt/Al2O3重整催化剂。

2. 增加Pb或Sn的含量会降低弱氢吸附和脱氢活性，同时增加氧气吸附。

3. 添加Pb或Sn通过配体效应化学改性Pt，影响其吸附能力。

4. 增加Pb或Sn含量会降低脱氢速率并增加活化能，少量Sn的毒化作用比Pb更强。

文献没有提供这些催化剂在轻烯烃脱氢领域的工业应用、最新发展或潜在优势的信息。它也缺乏关于金属氧化物基催化剂的信息，因此仅基于这篇文献无法进行全面比较。

The literature provided does not contain sufficient information to fully compare and contrast noble metal-based catalysts (particularly Platinum) and metal oxide-based catalysts used in the nonoxidative dehydrogenation of light olefins. The text focuses primarily on bimetallic Pt-Sn and Pt-Pb catalysts for cyclohexane dehydrogenation, which is not directly related to light olefin dehydrogenation.

The document mentions that bimetallic Pt-Sn and Pt-Pb catalysts are proposed as improvements over monometallic Pt/Al2O3 reforming catalysts. It discusses how increasing amounts of Pb or Sn affect hydrogen and oxygen adsorption, as well as cyclohexane dehydrogenation activity. The text also mentions chemical modification of Pt by Pb or Sn through ligand effects and electronic interactions.

However, the literature does not provide information on metal oxide-based catalysts such as CrOx, gallium, indium, vanadium, zinc, and molybdenum oxides. It also does not discuss industrial applications, recent developments, or potential advantages of these catalysts in light olefin dehydrogenation.

Given the limited scope of the provided literature, a comprehensive comparison of noble metal-based and metal oxide-based catalysts for light olefin dehydrogenation cannot be made based solely on this information.

提供的文献不包含足够的信息来全面比较和对比用于轻烯烃非氧化脱氢的贵金属基催化剂(特别是铂)和金属氧化物基催化剂。该文本主要集中在用于环己烷脱氢的双金属Pt-Sn和Pt-Pb催化剂上，这与轻烯烃脱氢并不直接相关。

文献提到双金属Pt-Sn和Pt-Pb催化剂被提议作为单金属Pt/Al2O3重整催化剂的改进。它讨论了增加Pb或Sn的量如何影响氢气和氧气的吸附，以及环己烷脱氢活性。文本还提到了通过配体效应和电子相互作用，Pb或Sn对Pt的化学修饰。

然而，该文献没有提供关于金属氧化物基催化剂如CrOx、镓、铟、钒、锌和钼氧化物的信息。它也没有讨论这些催化剂在轻烯烃脱氢中的工业应用、最新发展或潜在优势。

鉴于所提供文献的有限范围，仅基于这些信息无法对轻烯烃脱氢的贵金属基和金属氧化物基催化剂进行全面比较。

The bimetallic Pt-Sn and Pt-Pb catalysts are proposed as improvements over monometallic Pt/Al2O3 reforming catalysts. These catalysts show decreased hydrogen adsorption, increased oxygen adsorption, and decreased activity in cyclohexane dehydrogenation as the amount of Pb or Sn increases.

The modification of Pt by Pb or Sn is attributed to a ligand effect, which influences the adsorption capacity of the catalyst. Electronic interactions between Pt and Sn, as well as Pt and Pb, have been observed through spectroscopic investigations.

The literature does not provide information on the industrial applications, recent developments, or potential advantages of these catalysts in the field of light olefin dehydrogenation. It also does not compare these noble metal-based catalysts to metal oxide-based catalysts for this specific application.

The text focuses primarily on bimetallic Pt-Sn and Pt-Pb catalysts for cyclohexane dehydrogenation, which is not directly related to light olefin dehydrogenation.

From the limited information provided, we can infer that:

1. Platinum-based catalysts, particularly bimetallic Pt-Sn and Pt-Pb catalysts, are used in reforming processes, which may include dehydrogenation reactions.

2. The addition of Sn or Pb to Pt catalysts affects their performance in dehydrogenation reactions, generally decreasing activity.

3. The modification of Pt with Sn or Pb alters the catalyst's adsorption properties, which impacts its effectiveness in dehydrogenation.

4. Small amounts of Sn have a stronger poisoning effect than Pb on Pt catalysts.

However, the document does not provide information on metal oxide-based catalysts or their comparison with noble metal catalysts for light olefin dehydrogenation. It also lacks details on industrial applications, recent developments, and potential advantages of these catalysts in the field.

从提供的有限信息中，我们可以推断：

1. 铂基催化剂，特别是双金属Pt-Sn和Pt-Pb催化剂，在重整过程中使用，可能包括脱氢反应。

2. 向Pt催化剂中添加Sn或Pb会影响其在脱氢反应中的性能，通常会降低活性。

3. 用Sn或Pb对Pt的修饰改变了催化剂的吸附性质，这影响了其在脱氢中的有效性。

4. 少量的Sn对Pt催化剂的毒化作用比Pb更强。

然而，该文档没有提供关于金属氧化物基催化剂的信息，也没有比较它们与贵金属催化剂在轻烯烃脱氢中的应用。它也缺乏这些催化剂在该领域的工业应用、最新发展和潜在优势的详细信息。

It does not discuss metal oxide-based catalysts like CrOx, gallium, indium, vanadium, zinc, and molybdenum oxides.

For the platinum-based catalysts mentioned:

Composition: The catalysts consist of platinum with added lead or tin, supported on alumina (Al2O3).

Effectiveness: The addition of Pb or Sn decreases the catalytic activity for cyclohexane dehydrogenation. Small amounts of Sn have a stronger poisoning effect than Pb.

Mechanism: The second metal (Pb or Sn) affects hydrogen adsorption on the catalyst. Weak hydrogen adsorption decreases while oxygen adsorption increases with increasing amounts of the second metal.

The document does not provide information on industrial applications, recent developments, or potential advantages of these catalysts in light olefin dehydrogenation. It also lacks information on metal oxide-based catalysts, making a comprehensive comparison impossible based solely on this literature.

对于文中提到的铂基催化剂：

有效性：添加Pb或Sn会降低环己烷脱氢的催化活性。少量的Sn具有比Pb更强的毒化作用。

机理：第二种金属（Pb或Sn）影响催化剂上的氢气吸附。随着第二种金属含量的增加，弱氢气吸附减少，而氧气吸附增加。
