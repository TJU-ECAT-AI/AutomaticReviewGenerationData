[1] "Bimetallic Pt-Sn and Pt-Pb catalysts often axe proposed for an improvement of the monometallic Pt/AI2Oa reforming catalyst."

[2] "With increasing amounts of Pb or Sn the weak adsorption of hydrogen decreases, the adsorption of oxygen increases and the activity in the dehydrogenation of cyclohexane decreases."

[3] "The reason of the strongly influenced adsorption capacity of Pt in bimetallic catalysts should be a chemical modification of Pt by Pb or Sn according to a tgand effect."

[4] "Electronic interactions between Pt and Sn ]1/ and Pt and Pb 16] have been observed in spectroscopic investigations."

The literature provided does not contain sufficient information to fully compare and contrast noble metal-based catalysts (particularly Platinum) and metal oxide-based catalysts used in the nonoxidative dehydrogenation of light olefins. The text focuses primarily on bimetallic Pt-Sn and Pt-Pb catalysts for cyclohexane dehydrogenation, which is not directly related to light olefin dehydrogenation.

The document mentions that bimetallic Pt-Sn and Pt-Pb catalysts are proposed as improvements over monometallic Pt/Al2O3 reforming catalysts. It discusses how increasing amounts of Pb or Sn affect hydrogen and oxygen adsorption, as well as cyclohexane dehydrogenation activity. The text also mentions chemical modification of Pt by Pb or Sn through ligand effects and electronic interactions.

However, the literature does not provide information on metal oxide-based catalysts such as CrOx, gallium, indium, vanadium, zinc, and molybdenum oxides. It also does not discuss industrial applications, recent developments, or potential advantages of these catalysts in light olefin dehydrogenation.

Given the limited scope of the provided literature, a comprehensive comparison of noble metal-based and metal oxide-based catalysts for light olefin dehydrogenation cannot be made based solely on this information.

提供的文献不包含足够的信息来全面比较和对比用于轻烯烃非氧化脱氢的贵金属基催化剂(特别是铂)和金属氧化物基催化剂。该文本主要集中在用于环己烷脱氢的双金属Pt-Sn和Pt-Pb催化剂上，这与轻烯烃脱氢并不直接相关。

文献提到双金属Pt-Sn和Pt-Pb催化剂被提议作为单金属Pt/Al2O3重整催化剂的改进。它讨论了增加Pb或Sn的量如何影响氢气和氧气的吸附，以及环己烷脱氢活性。文本还提到了通过配体效应和电子相互作用，Pb或Sn对Pt的化学修饰。

然而，该文献没有提供关于金属氧化物基催化剂如CrOx、镓、铟、钒、锌和钼氧化物的信息。它也没有讨论这些催化剂在轻烯烃脱氢中的工业应用、最新发展或潜在优势。

鉴于所提供文献的有限范围，仅基于这些信息无法对轻烯烃脱氢的贵金属基和金属氧化物基催化剂进行全面比较。
