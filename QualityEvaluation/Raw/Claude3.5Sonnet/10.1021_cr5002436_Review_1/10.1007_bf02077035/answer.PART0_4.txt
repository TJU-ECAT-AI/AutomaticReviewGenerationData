[1] "Bimetallic Pt-Sn and Pt-Pb catalysts often axe proposed for an improvement of the monometallic Pt/AI2Oa reforming catalyst."

[2] "With increasing amounts of Pb or Sn the weak adsorption of hydrogen decreases, the adsorption of oxygen increases and the activity in the dehydrogenation of cyclohexane decreases."

[3] "Small amounts of Sn poison stronger than Pb."

[4] "The decreasing low temperature adsorption could be explained in different ways. The dissociative adsorption of hydrogen could become a more and more activated process with increasing anounts of the second metal"

The literature primarily focuses on platinum-based bimetallic catalysts (Pt-Sn and Pt-Pb) for the dehydrogenation of cyclohexane, which is not directly related to light olefin dehydrogenation. It does not discuss metal oxide-based catalysts like CrOx, gallium, indium, vanadium, zinc, and molybdenum oxides.

For the platinum-based catalysts mentioned:

Composition: The catalysts consist of platinum with added lead or tin, supported on alumina (Al2O3).

Effectiveness: The addition of Pb or Sn decreases the catalytic activity for cyclohexane dehydrogenation. Small amounts of Sn have a stronger poisoning effect than Pb.

Mechanism: The second metal (Pb or Sn) affects hydrogen adsorption on the catalyst. Weak hydrogen adsorption decreases while oxygen adsorption increases with increasing amounts of the second metal.

The document does not provide information on industrial applications, recent developments, or potential advantages of these catalysts in light olefin dehydrogenation. It also lacks information on metal oxide-based catalysts, making a comprehensive comparison impossible based solely on this literature.

该文献主要关注铂基双金属催化剂（Pt-Sn和Pt-Pb）用于环己烷脱氢，这与轻烯烃脱氢不直接相关。文中未讨论金属氧化物基催化剂，如CrOx、镓、铟、钒、锌和钼氧化物。

对于文中提到的铂基催化剂：

组成：催化剂由铂和添加的铅或锡组成，以氧化铝（Al2O3）为载体。

有效性：添加Pb或Sn会降低环己烷脱氢的催化活性。少量的Sn具有比Pb更强的毒化作用。

机理：第二种金属（Pb或Sn）影响催化剂上的氢气吸附。随着第二种金属含量的增加，弱氢气吸附减少，而氧气吸附增加。

文献没有提供这些催化剂在轻烯烃脱氢中的工业应用、最新发展或潜在优势的信息。它也缺乏关于金属氧化物基催化剂的信息，因此仅基于这篇文献无法进行全面的比较。
