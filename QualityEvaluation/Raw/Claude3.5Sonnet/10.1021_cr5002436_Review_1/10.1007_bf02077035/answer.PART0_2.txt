[1] "Bimetallic Pt-Sn and Pt-Pb catalysts often axe proposed for an improvement of the monometallic Pt/AI2Oa reforming catalyst."

[2] "With increasing amounts of Pb or Sn the weak adsorption of hydrogen decreases, the adsorption of oxygen increases and the activity in the dehydrogenation of cyclohexane decreases."

[3] "The reason of the strongly influenced adsorption capacity of Pt in bimetallic catalysts should be a chemical modification of Pt by Pb or Sn according to a tgand effect."

[4] "Electronic interactions between Pt and Sn ]1/ and Pt and Pb 16] have been observed in spectroscopic investigations."

The literature primarily focuses on bimetallic Pt-Sn and Pt-Pb catalysts for dehydrogenation reactions, particularly the dehydrogenation of cyclohexane. It does not provide information on metal oxide-based catalysts such as CrOx, gallium, indium, vanadium, zinc, and molybdenum oxides for light olefin dehydrogenation.

The bimetallic Pt-Sn and Pt-Pb catalysts are proposed as improvements over monometallic Pt/Al2O3 reforming catalysts. These catalysts show decreased hydrogen adsorption, increased oxygen adsorption, and decreased activity in cyclohexane dehydrogenation as the amount of Pb or Sn increases.

The modification of Pt by Pb or Sn is attributed to a ligand effect, which influences the adsorption capacity of the catalyst. Electronic interactions between Pt and Sn, as well as Pt and Pb, have been observed through spectroscopic investigations.

The literature does not provide information on the industrial applications, recent developments, or potential advantages of these catalysts in the field of light olefin dehydrogenation. It also does not compare these noble metal-based catalysts to metal oxide-based catalysts for this specific application.

这篇文献主要关注双金属Pt-Sn和Pt-Pb催化剂在脱氢反应中的应用，特别是环己烷的脱氢反应。它没有提供关于CrOx、镓、铟、钒、锌和钼氧化物等金属氧化物催化剂在轻烯烃脱氢中的信息。

双金属Pt-Sn和Pt-Pb催化剂被提议作为单金属Pt/Al2O3重整催化剂的改进。随着Pb或Sn含量的增加，这些催化剂表现出氢吸附减少、氧吸附增加以及环己烷脱氢活性降低的特性。

Pb或Sn对Pt的改性被归因于配体效应，这影响了催化剂的吸附能力。通过光谱研究观察到了Pt与Sn以及Pt与Pb之间的电子相互作用。

文献没有提供这些催化剂在轻烯烃脱氢领域的工业应用、最新发展或潜在优势的信息。它也没有将这些贵金属基催化剂与金属氧化物基催化剂在这一特定应用中进行比较。
