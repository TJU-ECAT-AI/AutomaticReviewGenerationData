Unfortunately, I cannot provide a detailed comparison and contrast of noble metal-based catalysts and metal oxide-based catalysts for the nonoxidative dehydrogenation of light olefins based on the given literature. The provided text appears to be incomplete and does not contain any relevant information to address the question. The literature snippet only includes the title, authors, and publication details of a research article about propane dehydrogenation over PtSn catalysts, but does not provide any substantive content about the catalysts mentioned in the question or their properties and applications.
