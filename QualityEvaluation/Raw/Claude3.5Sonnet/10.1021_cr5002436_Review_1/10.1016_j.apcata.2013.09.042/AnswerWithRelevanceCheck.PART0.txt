          [1] "Pt-based catalysts are widely used in the dehydrogenation of paraffins to olefins [1], Pt Sn bimetallic catalysts are reported to be efficient catalysts for commercial operation [2]."

[2] "To improve the olefin selectivity and catalyst stability, alkali [36], alkaline earth [79], and rare earth metals [10,11] have been incorporated."

[3] "In addition to Al2O3, other supports, such as SiO2 [12], TiO2 [13], CCA [14], and mixed oxide spinels [15], have also been reported."

[4] "Compared to Al2O3, spinels such as MgAl2O4 have a lower acidity and a higher mechanical strength; these traits are important for dehydro-genation catalysts [16,17]."

[5] "Dehydrogenating long chain paraffins (n-C10C13) over Pt Sn/Al2O3 catalysts is an important process for the industrial synthesis of linear alkylbenzene sulfonate (LAS); LAS is a popular biodegradable detergent."

[6] "Dehydrogenating long chain paraffin suffers from severe coking and short catalyst lifetimes (a few months); in addition, the acidity of the support is critical and well established."

[7] "When dehydrogenating long chain paraffins, the cata-lysts tend to be deactivated very quickly during the initial stages of the reaction, particularly when the reaction takes place under harsh conditions, such as high temperatures, low gas hourly space velocity and small hydrogen/paraffin ratios."

          The provided information primarily focuses on platinum-based catalysts, particularly Pt-Sn bimetallic catalysts, for the dehydrogenation of paraffins. It does not offer a comprehensive comparison with metal oxide-based catalysts for light olefin dehydrogenation. However, based on the available information:

Composition:
- Pt-based catalysts, especially Pt-Sn bimetallic catalysts, are widely used.
- Alkali, alkaline earth, and rare earth metals are incorporated to improve olefin selectivity and catalyst stability.
- Supported on materials like Al2O3, SiO2, TiO2, and mixed oxide spinels such as MgAl2O4.

Effectiveness:
- Pt-Sn catalysts are reported to be efficient for commercial operations.
- However, they suffer from severe coking and short catalyst lifetimes when used for long-chain paraffin dehydrogenation.
- Catalysts tend to deactivate quickly during initial stages, especially under harsh conditions.

Industrial applications:
- Used in dehydrogenation of paraffins to olefins.
- Specifically mentioned for long-chain paraffins (C10-C13) dehydrogenation in the industrial synthesis of linear alkylbenzene sulfonate (LAS), a biodegradable detergent.

Recent developments:
- Incorporation of alkali, alkaline earth, and rare earth metals to improve performance.
- Exploration of different supports, particularly mixed oxide spinels like MgAl2O4, which offer lower acidity and higher mechanical strength compared to Al2O3.

Potential advantages:
- While not explicitly stated, Pt-based catalysts seem to be preferred in industrial applications despite limitations, suggesting potential advantages in activity or selectivity.

The document does not provide information on metal oxide-based catalysts like CrOx, gallium, indium, vanadium, zinc, and molybdenum oxides for comparison. To fully address the question, additional sources would be needed to discuss these catalysts in the context of light olefin dehydrogenation.

          提供的信息主要集中在铂基催化剂，特别是Pt-Sn双金属催化剂用于烷烃脱氢反应。它没有提供与金属氧化物基催化剂在轻质烯烃脱氢方面的全面比较。然而，根据可用信息：

组成：
- 铂基催化剂，特别是Pt-Sn双金属催化剂被广泛使用。
- 添加碱金属、碱土金属和稀土金属以提高烯烃选择性和催化剂稳定性。
- 以Al2O3、SiO2、TiO2和MgAl2O4等混合氧化物尖晶石为载体。

有效性：
- Pt-Sn催化剂被报道在商业运营中效率高。
- 然而，在用于长链烷烃脱氢时，它们会遭受严重的结焦和短催化剂寿命问题。
- 催化剂在反应初期容易快速失活，特别是在高温、低气体小时空速和小氢气/烷烃比等苛刻条件下。

工业应用：
- 用于烷烃到烯烃的脱氢反应。
- 特别提到用于长链烷烃（C10-C13）脱氢，在工业合成线性烷基苯磺酸盐（LAS）中使用，LAS是一种可生物降解的洗涤剂。

最新发展：
- 添加碱金属、碱土金属和稀土金属以提高性能。
- 探索不同的载体，特别是MgAl2O4等混合氧化物尖晶石，与Al2O3相比具有较低的酸度和较高的机械强度。

潜在优势：
- 虽然没有明确说明，但Pt基催化剂似乎在工业应用中更受青睐，尽管有局限性，这表明它们在活性或选择性方面可能具有一些优势。

该文档没有提供关于CrOx、镓、铟、钒、锌和钼氧化物等金属氧化物基催化剂的信息以供比较。要全面回答这个问题，需要额外的资料来讨论这些催化剂在轻质烯烃脱氢背景下的特性。
