[1] "Pt-based catalysts are widely used in the dehydrogenation of paraffins to olefins [1], Pt Sn bimetallic catalysts are reported to be efficient catalysts for commercial operation [2]."

[2] "To improve the olefin selectivity and catalyst stability, alkali [36], alkaline earth [79], and rare earth metals [10,11] have been incorporated."

[3] "Compared to Al2O3, spinels such as MgAl2O4 have a lower acidity and a higher mechanical strength; these traits are important for dehydrogenation catalysts [16,17]."

[4] "Dehydrogenating long chain paraffin suffers from severe coking and short catalyst lifetimes (a few months); in addition, the acidity of the support is critical and well established."

The literature provided does not contain sufficient information to fully compare and contrast noble metal-based catalysts with metal oxide-based catalysts for the nonoxidative dehydrogenation of light olefins. The text primarily focuses on platinum-based catalysts, particularly Pt-Sn bimetallic catalysts, for the dehydrogenation of paraffins.

From the limited information available:

1. Composition: Platinum-based catalysts, especially Pt-Sn bimetallic catalysts, are mentioned. The literature does not discuss the composition of metal oxide-based catalysts like CrOx, gallium, indium, vanadium, zinc, and molybdenum oxides.

2. Effectiveness: Pt-Sn bimetallic catalysts are described as efficient for commercial operations in paraffin dehydrogenation. However, the effectiveness of metal oxide-based catalysts is not discussed.

3. Industrial applications: The text mentions that Pt-based catalysts are widely used in the dehydrogenation of paraffins to olefins, but does not provide information on the industrial applications of metal oxide-based catalysts.

4. Recent developments: The incorporation of alkali, alkaline earth, and rare earth metals to improve olefin selectivity and catalyst stability is mentioned as a development for Pt-based catalysts. No information is provided on recent developments in metal oxide-based catalysts.

5. Potential advantages: The literature does not directly compare the advantages of noble metal-based catalysts to metal oxide-based catalysts. However, it mentions that Pt-based catalysts suffer from severe coking and short lifetimes when dehydrogenating long-chain paraffins.

In conclusion, while the text provides some information on Pt-based catalysts for paraffin dehydrogenation, it lacks the necessary details to make a comprehensive comparison with metal oxide-based catalysts for light olefin dehydrogenation.

提供的文献没有足够的信息来全面比较和对比用于轻质烯烃非氧化脱氢的贵金属基催化剂和金属氧化物基催化剂。该文本主要关注铂基催化剂，特别是用于烷烃脱氢的铂-锡双金属催化剂。

根据有限的可用信息：

1. 组成：提到了铂基催化剂，特别是铂-锡双金属催化剂。文献没有讨论CrOx、镓、铟、钒、锌和钼氧化物等金属氧化物基催化剂的组成。

2. 有效性：铂-锡双金属催化剂被描述为在商业烷烃脱氢操作中效率高。然而，没有讨论金属氧化物基催化剂的有效性。

3. 工业应用：文本提到铂基催化剂在烷烃脱氢制烯烃中被广泛使用，但没有提供关于金属氧化物基催化剂工业应用的信息。

4. 最新发展：提到了添加碱金属、碱土金属和稀土金属以提高烯烃选择性和催化剂稳定性，这是铂基催化剂的一个发展。没有提供关于金属氧化物基催化剂最新发展的信息。

5. 潜在优势：文献没有直接比较贵金属基催化剂和金属氧化物基催化剂的优势。但是，它提到铂基催化剂在长链烷烃脱氢时会遭受严重的结焦和短寿命问题。

总之，虽然文本提供了一些关于铂基催化剂用于烷烃脱氢的信息，但缺乏必要的细节来对轻质烯烃脱氢的贵金属基催化剂和金属氧化物基催化剂进行全面比较。
