The literature primarily focuses on platinum-based catalysts for dehydrogenation of paraffins, particularly Pt-Sn bimetallic catalysts. It does not provide detailed information about metal oxide-based catalysts like CrOx, gallium, indium, vanadium, zinc, and molybdenum oxides for light olefin dehydrogenation.

For Pt-based catalysts:

Composition: Pt-Sn bimetallic catalysts are mentioned as efficient for commercial operations. Alkali, alkaline earth, and rare earth metals have been incorporated to improve olefin selectivity and catalyst stability.

Effectiveness: Pt-based catalysts are widely used, suggesting good effectiveness for paraffin dehydrogenation.

Industrial applications: The text implies commercial use of Pt-Sn catalysts for paraffin dehydrogenation.

Recent developments: The incorporation of various metals (alkali, alkaline earth, rare earth) to improve performance is mentioned.

Potential advantages: Not explicitly stated, but implied to be effective for commercial use.

Supports: Various supports are mentioned, including Al2O3, SiO2, TiO2, CCA, and mixed oxide spinels. MgAl2O4 spinels are noted to have lower acidity and higher mechanical strength compared to Al2O3, which are important traits for dehydrogenation catalysts.

The document does not provide information to compare these Pt-based catalysts with metal oxide-based catalysts for light olefin dehydrogenation.

该文献主要关注铂基催化剂在烷烃脱氢中的应用，特别是Pt-Sn双金属催化剂。它没有提供关于CrOx、镓、铟、钒、锌和钼氧化物等金属氧化物基催化剂在轻质烯烃脱氢中的详细信息。

对于Pt基催化剂：

组成：提到Pt-Sn双金属催化剂在商业运营中效率高。为了提高烯烃选择性和催化剂稳定性，已经引入了碱金属、碱土金属和稀土金属。

有效性：Pt基催化剂被广泛使用，表明它们在烷烃脱氢中具有良好的效果。

工业应用：文本暗示Pt-Sn催化剂在烷烃脱氢中有商业应用。

最新发展：提到了引入各种金属（碱金属、碱土金属、稀土）以改善性能。

潜在优势：虽然没有明确说明，但暗示在商业使用中有效。

载体：提到了各种载体，包括Al2O3、SiO2、TiO2、CCA和混合氧化物尖晶石。注意到MgAl2O4尖晶石与Al2O3相比具有较低的酸度和较高的机械强度，这些特性对于脱氢催化剂很重要。

该文档没有提供比较这些Pt基催化剂与金属氧化物基催化剂在轻质烯烃脱氢中的信息。
