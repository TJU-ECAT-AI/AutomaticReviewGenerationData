This document does not contain information to directly compare and contrast noble metal-based catalysts and metal oxide-based catalysts for light olefin dehydrogenation. The text focuses on platinum-tin catalysts supported on magnesium-aluminum oxides for n-dodecane dehydrogenation, which is a longer hydrocarbon. It does not discuss other metal oxide catalysts like chromium, gallium, indium, vanadium, zinc or molybdenum oxides. The paper also does not cover light olefin dehydrogenation or industrial applications of different catalyst types. Without relevant information in the given literature, I cannot provide a meaningful comparison of these catalyst types or discuss their compositions, effectiveness, industrial applications, recent developments, and potential advantages for light olefin dehydrogenation.

[1] "Pt-based catalysts are widely used in the dehydrogenation of paraffins to olefins [1], Pt Sn bimetallic catalysts are reported to be efficient catalysts for commercial operation [2]."

[2] "To improve the olefin selectivity and catalyst stability, alkali [36], alkaline earth [79], and rare earth metals [10,11] have been incorporated."

[3] "In addition to Al2O3, other supports, such as SiO2 [12], TiO2 [13], CCA [14], and mixed oxide spinels [15], have also been reported."

[4] "Compared to Al2O3, spinels such as MgAl2O4 have a lower acidity and a higher mechanical strength; these traits are important for dehydro-genation catalysts [16,17]."

[5] "Dehydrogenating long chain paraffins (n-C10C13) over Pt Sn/Al2O3 catalysts is an important process for the industrial synthesis of linear alkylbenzene sulfonate (LAS); LAS is a popular biodegradable detergent."

<EnglishVersionAnswer>

The literature primarily focuses on platinum-based catalysts for dehydrogenation, particularly Pt-Sn bimetallic catalysts. It does not directly compare these to metal oxide-based catalysts like CrOx, gallium, indium, vanadium, zinc, and molybdenum oxides for light olefin dehydrogenation.

For Pt-based catalysts:

Composition: Platinum is often combined with tin to form Pt-Sn bimetallic catalysts. These are typically supported on materials like Al2O3, SiO2, TiO2, or mixed oxide spinels like MgAl2O4.

Effectiveness: Pt-Sn catalysts are described as efficient for commercial operations. Their effectiveness can be improved by incorporating alkali, alkaline earth, or rare earth metals.

Industrial applications: Pt-Sn/Al2O3 catalysts are used industrially for dehydrogenating long-chain paraffins (C10-C13) to produce linear alkylbenzene sulfonate, a biodegradable detergent.

Recent developments: The use of mixed oxide spinel supports like MgAl2O4 is mentioned as an improvement over traditional Al2O3 supports, offering lower acidity and higher mechanical strength.

Potential advantages: Pt-based catalysts offer high activity and selectivity for dehydrogenation reactions. The ability to tune their properties through support selection and incorporation of promoter metals allows for optimization of performance.

The document does not provide information on metal oxide-based catalysts for comparison. To fully answer the question, additional sources would be needed to discuss the characteristics and applications of CrOx, gallium, indium, vanadium, zinc, and molybdenum oxide catalysts in light olefin dehydrogenation.

这篇文献主要关注铂基催化剂在脱氢反应中的应用，特别是Pt-Sn双金属催化剂。它没有直接将这些催化剂与金属氧化物基催化剂（如CrOx、镓、铟、钒、锌和钼氧化物）在轻烯烃脱氢反应中的性能进行比较。

对于铂基催化剂：

组成：铂通常与锡结合形成Pt-Sn双金属催化剂。这些催化剂通常负载在Al2O3、SiO2、TiO2或MgAl2O4等混合氧化物尖晶石等材料上。

有效性：Pt-Sn催化剂被描述为适用于商业运营的高效催化剂。通过添加碱金属、碱土金属或稀土金属可以进一步提高其效率。

工业应用：Pt-Sn/Al2O3催化剂在工业上用于长链石蜡（C10-C13）的脱氢，生产线性烷基苯磺酸盐，这是一种可生物降解的洗涤剂。

最新发展：使用MgAl2O4等混合氧化物尖晶石作为载体被认为是对传统Al2O3载体的改进，具有较低的酸性和较高的机械强度。

潜在优势：铂基催化剂在脱氢反应中具有高活性和选择性。通过选择载体和添加促进剂金属可以调节其性能，从而优化催化效果。

该文档没有提供关于金属氧化物基催化剂的信息以供比较。要全面回答这个问题，需要额外的资料来讨论CrOx、镓、铟、钒、锌和钼氧化物催化剂在轻烯烃脱氢反应中的特性和应用。

The literature does not provide a comprehensive comparison between noble metal-based catalysts and metal oxide-based catalysts for the nonoxidative dehydrogenation of light olefins. However, it does offer some insights into platinum-based catalysts:

Composition: Platinum-based catalysts, particularly Pt-Sn bimetallic catalysts, are widely used for paraffin dehydrogenation. These catalysts are often supported on materials like Al2O3 or MgAl2O4 spinels.

Effectiveness: Pt-Sn catalysts are reported to be efficient for commercial operations. However, they suffer from issues like severe coking and short catalyst lifetimes when used for long-chain paraffin dehydrogenation.

Industrial applications: These catalysts are used in the dehydrogenation of paraffins to olefins, including long-chain paraffins (C10-C13) for the industrial synthesis of linear alkylbenzene sulfonate (LAS), a popular biodegradable detergent.

Recent developments: Efforts to improve olefin selectivity and catalyst stability include incorporating alkali, alkaline earth, and rare earth metals into the catalysts. Additionally, there's research into using different supports like MgAl2O4 spinels, which have lower acidity and higher mechanical strength compared to Al2O3.

Potential advantages: The literature doesn't explicitly state advantages of Pt-based catalysts over metal oxide-based ones. However, it implies that Pt-based catalysts are preferred in industrial applications despite their limitations, suggesting they may have some advantages in terms of activity or selectivity.

The document doesn't provide information on metal oxide-based catalysts like CrOx, gallium, indium, vanadium, zinc, and molybdenum oxides for light olefin dehydrogenation, so a comparison cannot be made based on this text alone.

该文献并未提供贵金属基催化剂与金属氧化物基催化剂在轻质烯烃非氧化脱氢方面的全面比较。但是，它确实提供了一些关于铂基催化剂的见解：

组成：铂基催化剂，特别是Pt-Sn双金属催化剂，被广泛用于烷烃脱氢。这些催化剂通常以Al2O3或MgAl2O4尖晶石为载体。

有效性：据报道，Pt-Sn催化剂在商业运营中效率高。然而，当用于长链烷烃脱氢时，它们会遇到严重结焦和催化剂寿命短的问题。

工业应用：这些催化剂用于烷烃到烯烃的脱氢，包括长链烷烃（C10-C13）的脱氢，用于工业合成线性烷基苯磺酸盐（LAS），这是一种流行的可生物降解洗涤剂。

最新发展：为提高烯烃选择性和催化剂稳定性，研究人员正在尝试在催化剂中加入碱金属、碱土金属和稀土金属。此外，还有研究探索使用不同的载体，如MgAl2O4尖晶石，与Al2O3相比，它具有较低的酸度和较高的机械强度。

潜在优势：文献没有明确指出Pt基催化剂相对于金属氧化物基催化剂的优势。然而，它暗示尽管Pt基催化剂有局限性，但在工业应用中仍被青睐，这表明它们在活性或选择性方面可能具有一些优势。

该文档没有提供关于CrOx、镓、铟、钒、锌和钼氧化物等金属氧化物基催化剂在轻质烯烃脱氢中的信息，因此仅基于此文本无法进行比较。
