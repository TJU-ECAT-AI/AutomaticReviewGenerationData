[1] "The dehydrogenation of paraffins to olefins and hydrogen, however, is thermodynamically possible only at somewhat elevated temperatures. At such temperatures copper loses activity (11), and nickel, platinum, and palladium bring about a complex decomposition (3)."

[2] "Eight hundred grams of Baker's c. P, chromic nitrate hydrate were dissolved in 8 liters of distilled water, and the solution was clarified by filtration B solution of 400 grams of ammonium acetate in 16 liters of distilled water was then added."

[3] "Pure propane under atmospheric pressure was then passed over the gel at 400° C. at a rate of 10 liters per hour for the 5-cc. portion of granular catalyst. Dehydrogenation activity gradually developed and full activity was reached in several hours with the formation of nearly equilibrium concentrations of about 4 per cent each of hydrogen and propylene."

The literature does not provide a comprehensive comparison of noble metal-based catalysts and metal oxide-based catalysts for light olefin dehydrogenation. The document mainly focuses on chromium oxide catalysts and only briefly mentions some noble metals.

Based on the limited information provided:

1. Composition: The study uses a chromium oxide catalyst prepared from chromic nitrate hydrate and ammonium acetate.

2. Effectiveness: The chromium oxide catalyst was effective for dehydrogenating light paraffins (ethane, propane, butanes) at temperatures between 350-500°C. It achieved near-equilibrium concentrations of hydrogen and olefins.

3. Industrial applications: The catalyst was used for studying equilibrium constants in dehydrogenation reactions of light paraffins.

4. Recent developments: The paper describes a new preparation method for a chromium oxide catalyst that allows dehydrogenation with little interference from side reactions.

5. Potential advantages: The chromium oxide catalyst worked at lower temperatures (350-500°C) compared to uncatalyzed reactions (600-700°C for ethane). It also allowed equilibrium to be reached for higher paraffins without excessive side reactions.

The document mentions that nickel, platinum, and palladium catalysts cause complex decomposition at elevated temperatures required for dehydrogenation, suggesting a potential advantage for the chromium oxide catalyst in this application.

However, the paper does not provide information on other metal oxide catalysts like gallium, indium, vanadium, zinc, or molybdenum oxides, so a full comparison cannot be made based solely on this document.

该文献并未提供贵金属基催化剂和金属氧化物基催化剂在轻烯烃脱氢方面的全面比较。该文档主要关注铬氧化物催化剂，仅简略提及一些贵金属。

根据提供的有限信息：

1. 成分：该研究使用由铬酸盐水合物和乙酸铵制备的铬氧化物催化剂。

2. 有效性：铬氧化物催化剂在350-500°C的温度下能有效地脱氢轻质烷烃（乙烷、丙烷、丁烷）。它达到了接近平衡的氢气和烯烃浓度。

3. 工业应用：该催化剂用于研究轻质烷烃脱氢反应的平衡常数。

4. 最新发展：该论文描述了一种新的铬氧化物催化剂制备方法，可以在很少副反应干扰的情况下进行脱氢。

5. 潜在优势：与未催化反应相比（乙烷需600-700°C），铬氧化物催化剂在较低温度下工作（350-500°C）。它还允许在没有过多副反应的情况下达到较高烷烃的平衡。

文档提到镍、铂和钯催化剂在脱氢所需的高温下会导致复杂的分解，这表明铬氧化物催化剂在这种应用中可能具有潜在优势。

然而，该论文并未提供有关其他金属氧化物催化剂（如镓、铟、钒、锌或钼氧化物）的信息，因此仅根据这份文档无法进行全面比较。
