[1] "Dehydrogenation has been reported, however. Tausz and Putnoky (16) passed the vapors of pentane, hexane, heptane, and octane over palladium at 300° C. and obtained hydrogen and a small amount of unsaturated hydrocarbons."

[2] "In the course of a study of catalytic reactions of hydrocarbons, a catalyst was prepared from chromic oxide gel which brought about the dehydrogenation of simple paraffins into the corresponding olefins at 350° to 500° C."

[3] "At such temperatures copper loses activity (11), and nickel, platinum, and palladium bring about a complex decomposition (3)."

The document does not provide enough information to fully compare and contrast noble metal-based catalysts and metal oxide-based catalysts for nonoxidative dehydrogenation of light olefins. However, it does mention a few relevant points:

1. Palladium, a noble metal catalyst, was used for dehydrogenation of some hydrocarbons at 300°C, producing hydrogen and small amounts of unsaturated hydrocarbons.

2. A chromic oxide gel catalyst was developed that could dehydrogenate simple paraffins to olefins at 350-500°C.

3. At higher temperatures, copper loses activity, while nickel, platinum, and palladium cause complex decomposition rather than simple dehydrogenation.

The document does not discuss the compositions, effectiveness, industrial applications, recent developments, or potential advantages of these catalysts in detail. It also does not mention gallium, indium, vanadium, zinc, or molybdenum oxide catalysts.

该文档没有提供足够的信息来全面比较和对比用于轻烯烃非氧化脱氢的贵金属基催化剂和金属氧化物基催化剂。但是,它确实提到了一些相关点:

1. 钯作为贵金属催化剂,在300°C下用于某些碳氢化合物的脱氢,产生氢气和少量不饱和碳氢化合物。

2. 开发了一种氧化铬凝胶催化剂,可以在350-500°C下将简单的烷烃脱氢成烯烃。

3. 在更高的温度下,铜失去活性,而镍、铂和钯会导致复杂的分解反应,而不是简单的脱氢。

该文档没有详细讨论这些催化剂的成分、有效性、工业应用、最新发展或潜在优势。它也没有提到镓、铟、钒、锌或钼氧化物催化剂。
