[1] "Dehydrogenation has been reported, however. Tausz and Putnoky (16) passed the vapors of pentane, hexane, heptane, and octane over palladium at 300° C. and obtained hydrogen and a small amount of unsaturated hydrocarbons."

[2] "In the course of a study of catalytic reactions of hydrocarbons, a catalyst was prepared from chromic oxide gel which brought about the dehydrogenation of simple paraffins into the corresponding olefins at 350° to 500° C."

[3] "At such temperatures copper loses activity (11), and nickel, platinum, and palladium bring about a complex decomposition (3)."

The literature does not provide enough information to fully compare and contrast noble metal-based catalysts and metal oxide-based catalysts for the nonoxidative dehydrogenation of light olefins. However, some limited information is available:

Noble metal catalysts:
- Palladium was used to dehydrogenate pentane, hexane, heptane, and octane at 300°C, producing hydrogen and small amounts of unsaturated hydrocarbons.
- At higher temperatures (350-500°C), platinum and palladium catalysts led to complex decomposition reactions rather than selective dehydrogenation.

Metal oxide catalysts:
- A chromic oxide gel catalyst was effective for dehydrogenating simple paraffins to olefins at 350-500°C.
- The chromic oxide catalyst appeared to provide more selective dehydrogenation compared to noble metals at these higher temperatures.

The document does not discuss other metal oxide catalysts like gallium, indium, vanadium, zinc, or molybdenum oxides. It also lacks information on recent developments, industrial applications, or potential advantages of different catalyst types. More comprehensive and up-to-date sources would be needed to fully address the question.

该文献没有提供足够的信息来全面比较贵金属基催化剂和金属氧化物基催化剂在轻烯烃非氧化脱氢中的应用。然而,可以获得一些有限的信息:

贵金属催化剂:
- 钯被用于在300°C下使戊烷、己烷、庚烷和辛烷脱氢,产生氢气和少量不饱和烃。
- 在更高温度(350-500°C)下,铂和钯催化剂导致复杂的分解反应,而不是选择性脱氢。

金属氧化物催化剂:
- 一种由氧化铬凝胶制成的催化剂在350-500°C下能有效地使简单烷烃脱氢成烯烃。
- 与贵金属相比,氧化铬催化剂在这些较高温度下似乎提供了更选择性的脱氢。

该文档没有讨论其他金属氧化物催化剂,如镓、铟、钒、锌或钼的氧化物。它也缺乏关于不同类型催化剂的最新发展、工业应用或潜在优势的信息。需要更全面和最新的资料来充分回答这个问题。
