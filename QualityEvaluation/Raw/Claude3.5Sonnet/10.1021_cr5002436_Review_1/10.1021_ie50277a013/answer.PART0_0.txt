[1] "Dehydrogenation has been reported, however. Tausz and Putnoky (16) passed the vapors of pentane, hexane, heptane, and octane over palladium at 300° C. and obtained hydrogen and a small amount of unsaturated hydrocarbons."

[2] "In the course of a study of catalytic reactions of hydrocarbons, a catalyst was prepared from chromic oxide gel which brought about the dehydrogenation of simple paraffins into the corresponding olefins at 350° to 500° C."

[3] "At such temperatures copper loses activity (11), and nickel, platinum, and palladium bring about a complex decomposition (3)."

The provided literature does not contain sufficient information to fully compare and contrast noble metal-based catalysts and metal oxide-based catalysts for the nonoxidative dehydrogenation of light olefins. The text only briefly mentions a few catalysts:

1. Palladium is mentioned as a catalyst for dehydrogenation of some higher hydrocarbons at 300°C, producing small amounts of unsaturated hydrocarbons.

2. A chromic oxide gel catalyst is described as effective for dehydrogenating simple paraffins to olefins at 350-500°C.

3. The text notes that at higher temperatures, copper loses activity, while nickel, platinum, and palladium cause complex decomposition rather than simple dehydrogenation.

The document does not provide information on gallium, indium, vanadium, zinc, or molybdenum oxide catalysts, nor does it discuss recent developments or potential advantages of different catalyst types. Therefore, a comprehensive comparison of noble metal and metal oxide catalysts for light olefin dehydrogenation cannot be made based solely on this text.

提供的文献没有足够的信息来全面比较和对比用于轻质烯烃非氧化脱氢的贵金属基催化剂和金属氧化物基催化剂。文本只简要提到了几种催化剂：

1. 钯被提到作为在300°C下对一些较高碳氢化合物进行脱氢的催化剂，产生少量不饱和碳氢化合物。

2. 描述了一种由氧化铬凝胶制成的催化剂，可在350-500°C下有效地将简单的烷烃脱氢成烯烃。

3. 文本指出，在较高温度下，铜失去活性，而镍、铂和钯会导致复杂的分解反应，而不是简单的脱氢。

该文档没有提供关于镓、铟、钒、锌或钼氧化物催化剂的信息，也没有讨论不同类型催化剂的最新发展或潜在优势。因此，仅基于这段文本无法对轻质烯烃脱氢的贵金属和金属氧化物催化剂进行全面比较。
