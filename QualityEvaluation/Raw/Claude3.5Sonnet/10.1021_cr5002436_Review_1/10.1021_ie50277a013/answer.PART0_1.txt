[1] "For ethane: CH3CH3 ⇌ CH2=CH2 + H2"

[2] "Dehydrogenation has been reported, however. Tausz and Putnoky (16) passed the vapors of pentane, hexane, heptane, and octane over palladium at 300° C. and obtained hydrogen and a small amount of unsaturated hydrocarbons."

[3] "In the course of a study of catalytic reactions of hydrocarbons, a catalyst was prepared from chromic oxide gel which brought about the dehydrogenation of simple paraffins into the corresponding olefins at 350° to 500° C."

[4] "At such temperatures copper loses activity (11), and nickel, platinum, and palladium bring about a complex decomposition (3)."

The literature does not provide sufficient information to fully compare and contrast noble metal-based catalysts and metal oxide-based catalysts for nonoxidative dehydrogenation of light olefins. However, it does mention a few relevant points:

1. Palladium, a noble metal catalyst, was used for dehydrogenation of some hydrocarbons at 300°C, producing hydrogen and small amounts of unsaturated hydrocarbons.

2. A chromic oxide gel catalyst was developed that could dehydrogenate simple paraffins to olefins at 350-500°C.

3. At higher temperatures (not specified), copper loses activity, while nickel, platinum, and palladium cause complex decomposition rather than simple dehydrogenation.

The document does not provide information on gallium, indium, vanadium, zinc, or molybdenum oxide catalysts, nor does it discuss recent developments, industrial applications, or potential advantages of different catalyst types for light olefin dehydrogenation. More comprehensive and recent sources would be needed to fully address the question.

该文献没有提供足够的信息来全面比较和对比用于轻烯烃非氧化脱氢的贵金属基催化剂和金属氧化物基催化剂。然而,它确实提到了几个相关点:

1. 钯,一种贵金属催化剂,被用于在300°C下对一些烃类进行脱氢,产生氢气和少量不饱和烃。

2. 开发了一种铬氧化物凝胶催化剂,可以在350-500°C下将简单的烷烃脱氢成烯烃。

3. 在更高温度下(未指明),铜失去活性,而镍、铂和钯会引起复杂的分解反应,而不是简单的脱氢。

该文档没有提供关于镓、铟、钒、锌或钼氧化物催化剂的信息,也没有讨论不同类型催化剂在轻烯烃脱氢方面的最新发展、工业应用或潜在优势。需要更全面和更新的资料来充分回答这个问题。
