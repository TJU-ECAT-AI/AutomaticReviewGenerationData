<quotes>
[1] "Dehydrogenation has been reported, however. Tausz and Putnoky (16) passed the vapors of pentane, hexane, heptane, and octane over palladium at 300° C. and obtained hydrogen and a small amount of unsaturated hydrocarbons."

[2] "In the course of a study of catalytic reactions of hydrocarbons, a catalyst was prepared from chromic oxide gel which brought about the dehydrogenation of simple paraffins into the corresponding olefins at 350° to 500° C."

[3] "At such temperatures copper loses activity (11), and nickel, platinum, and palladium bring about a complex decomposition (3)."
</quotes>

<EnglishVersionAnswer>

The provided literature does not contain sufficient information to fully compare and contrast noble metal-based catalysts and metal oxide-based catalysts for the nonoxidative dehydrogenation of light olefins. The text only briefly mentions a few catalysts:

1. Palladium is mentioned as a catalyst for dehydrogenation of some higher hydrocarbons at 300°C, producing small amounts of unsaturated hydrocarbons.

2. A chromic oxide gel catalyst is described as effective for dehydrogenating simple paraffins to olefins at 350-500°C.

3. The text notes that at higher temperatures, copper loses activity, while nickel, platinum, and palladium cause complex decomposition rather than simple dehydrogenation.

The document does not provide information on gallium, indium, vanadium, zinc, or molybdenum oxide catalysts, nor does it discuss recent developments or potential advantages of different catalyst types. Therefore, a comprehensive comparison of noble metal and metal oxide catalysts for light olefin dehydrogenation cannot be made based solely on this text.

提供的文献没有足够的信息来全面比较和对比用于轻质烯烃非氧化脱氢的贵金属基催化剂和金属氧化物基催化剂。文本只简要提到了几种催化剂：

1. 钯被提到作为在300°C下对一些较高碳氢化合物进行脱氢的催化剂，产生少量不饱和碳氢化合物。

2. 描述了一种由氧化铬凝胶制成的催化剂，可在350-500°C下有效地将简单的烷烃脱氢成烯烃。

3. 文本指出，在较高温度下，铜失去活性，而镍、铂和钯会导致复杂的分解反应，而不是简单的脱氢。

该文档没有提供关于镓、铟、钒、锌或钼氧化物催化剂的信息，也没有讨论不同类型催化剂的最新发展或潜在优势。因此，仅基于这段文本无法对轻质烯烃脱氢的贵金属和金属氧化物催化剂进行全面比较。

[1] "The dehydrogenation of paraffins to olefins and hydrogen, however, is thermodynamically possible only at somewhat elevated temperatures. At such temperatures copper loses activity (11), and nickel, platinum, and palladium bring about a complex decomposition (3)."

[2] "Eight hundred grams of Baker's c. P, chromic nitrate hydrate were dissolved in 8 liters of distilled water, and the solution was clarified by filtration B solution of 400 grams of ammonium acetate in 16 liters of distilled water was then added."

[3] "Pure propane under atmospheric pressure was then passed over the gel at 400° C. at a rate of 10 liters per hour for the 5-cc. portion of granular catalyst. Dehydrogenation activity gradually developed and full activity was reached in several hours with the formation of nearly equilibrium concentrations of about 4 per cent each of hydrogen and propylene."

The literature does not provide a comprehensive comparison of noble metal-based catalysts and metal oxide-based catalysts for light olefin dehydrogenation. The document mainly focuses on chromium oxide catalysts and only briefly mentions some noble metals.

Based on the limited information provided:

1. Composition: The study uses a chromium oxide catalyst prepared from chromic nitrate hydrate and ammonium acetate.

2. Effectiveness: The chromium oxide catalyst was effective for dehydrogenating light paraffins (ethane, propane, butanes) at temperatures between 350-500°C. It achieved near-equilibrium concentrations of hydrogen and olefins.

3. Industrial applications: The catalyst was used for studying equilibrium constants in dehydrogenation reactions of light paraffins.

4. Recent developments: The paper describes a new preparation method for a chromium oxide catalyst that allows dehydrogenation with little interference from side reactions.

5. Potential advantages: The chromium oxide catalyst worked at lower temperatures (350-500°C) compared to uncatalyzed reactions (600-700°C for ethane). It also allowed equilibrium to be reached for higher paraffins without excessive side reactions.

The document mentions that nickel, platinum, and palladium catalysts cause complex decomposition at elevated temperatures required for dehydrogenation, suggesting a potential advantage for the chromium oxide catalyst in this application.

However, the paper does not provide information on other metal oxide catalysts like gallium, indium, vanadium, zinc, or molybdenum oxides, so a full comparison cannot be made based solely on this document.

该文献并未提供贵金属基催化剂和金属氧化物基催化剂在轻烯烃脱氢方面的全面比较。该文档主要关注铬氧化物催化剂，仅简略提及一些贵金属。

根据提供的有限信息：

1. 成分：该研究使用由铬酸盐水合物和乙酸铵制备的铬氧化物催化剂。

2. 有效性：铬氧化物催化剂在350-500°C的温度下能有效地脱氢轻质烷烃（乙烷、丙烷、丁烷）。它达到了接近平衡的氢气和烯烃浓度。

3. 工业应用：该催化剂用于研究轻质烷烃脱氢反应的平衡常数。

4. 最新发展：该论文描述了一种新的铬氧化物催化剂制备方法，可以在很少副反应干扰的情况下进行脱氢。

5. 潜在优势：与未催化反应相比（乙烷需600-700°C），铬氧化物催化剂在较低温度下工作（350-500°C）。它还允许在没有过多副反应的情况下达到较高烷烃的平衡。

文档提到镍、铂和钯催化剂在脱氢所需的高温下会导致复杂的分解，这表明铬氧化物催化剂在这种应用中可能具有潜在优势。

然而，该论文并未提供有关其他金属氧化物催化剂（如镓、铟、钒、锌或钼氧化物）的信息，因此仅根据这份文档无法进行全面比较。

The literature does not provide enough information to fully compare and contrast noble metal-based catalysts and metal oxide-based catalysts for the nonoxidative dehydrogenation of light olefins. However, some limited information is available:

Noble metal catalysts:
- Palladium was used to dehydrogenate pentane, hexane, heptane, and octane at 300°C, producing hydrogen and small amounts of unsaturated hydrocarbons.
- At higher temperatures (350-500°C), platinum and palladium catalysts led to complex decomposition reactions rather than selective dehydrogenation.

Metal oxide catalysts:
- A chromic oxide gel catalyst was effective for dehydrogenating simple paraffins to olefins at 350-500°C.
- The chromic oxide catalyst appeared to provide more selective dehydrogenation compared to noble metals at these higher temperatures.

The document does not discuss other metal oxide catalysts like gallium, indium, vanadium, zinc, or molybdenum oxides. It also lacks information on recent developments, industrial applications, or potential advantages of different catalyst types. More comprehensive and up-to-date sources would be needed to fully address the question.
