Read the questions and answers provided below. First, critically assess the overall relevance of the answers provided to the set of questions asked.

If, upon your assessment, you find that the answers do not contain information that is relevant to the questions asked, stop your review process immediately and respond with a single sentence: "※※※※※※※The provided answers are not relevant to the questions.※※※※※※※". Do not provide any additional explanation or background information, only this sentence should be given as a response in case of irrelevant answers.

If, however, the answers are relevant to the questions asked, proceed to compile answers for each question according to the instructions below. Ensure to aggregate all the relevant answers from the multiple answer results provided in the document, and organize them sequentially by their order number, compiling the corresponding quotes, English answers, and Chinese answers for each question.

If the provided answers' quotes are not differentiated by question, ensure to break them down and assign the quotes to each respective question, outputting them separately within each question's section.

To provide a comprehensive review, differentiate the responses into quotes, English answers, and Chinese answers for each question based on the details given in the 'Answer' XML tags. Structure your review using the XML format showcased below if the answers are relevant to the questions asked:

<questions>

Compare and contrast the noble metal-based catalysts (particularly Platinum) and metal oxide-based catalysts (such as CrOx, gallium, indium, vanadium, zinc, and molybdenum oxides) used in the nonoxidative dehydrogenation of light olefins. Discuss their compositions, effectiveness, industrial applications, recent developments, and potential advantages in the field.

<EnglishVersionAnswer>

The given literature does not contain information to compare and contrast noble metal-based catalysts (particularly Platinum) and metal oxide-based catalysts (such as CrOx, gallium, indium, vanadium, zinc, and molybdenum oxides) used in the nonoxidative dehydrogenation of light olefins. The document appears to be about the hydrothermal growth of mesoporous SBA-15 silica in the presence of PVP-stabilized Pt nanoparticles, which is not directly related to the question asked. There is insufficient information to discuss their compositions, effectiveness, industrial applications, recent developments, and potential advantages in the field of nonoxidative dehydrogenation of light olefins.

给出的文献不包含比较和对比用于轻烯烃非氧化脱氢的贵金属基催化剂（特别是铂）和金属氧化物基催化剂（如CrOx、镓、铟、钒、锌和钼氧化物）的信息。该文档似乎是关于在PVP稳定的Pt纳米粒子存在下水热生长介孔SBA-15二氧化硅的内容，这与所问的问题没有直接关系。没有足够的信息来讨论它们在轻烯烃非氧化脱氢领域的成分、有效性、工业应用、最新发展和潜在优势。

<EnglishVersionAnswer>

The given scientific literature does not contain any information relevant to comparing and contrasting noble metal-based catalysts (particularly Platinum) and metal oxide-based catalysts used in the nonoxidative dehydrogenation of light olefins. The document appears to be only a title and author list for an article about hydrothermal growth of mesoporous SBA-15 silica with platinum nanoparticles. It does not provide any details about catalyst compositions, effectiveness, industrial applications, recent developments, or potential advantages in the field of light olefin dehydrogenation.
