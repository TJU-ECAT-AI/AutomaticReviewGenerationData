Read the questions and answers provided below. First, critically assess the overall relevance of the answers provided to the set of questions asked.

If, upon your assessment, you find that the answers do not contain information that is relevant to the questions asked, stop your review process immediately and respond with a single sentence: "※※※※※※※The provided answers are not relevant to the questions.※※※※※※※". Do not provide any additional explanation or background information, only this sentence should be given as a response in case of irrelevant answers.

If, however, the answers are relevant to the questions asked, proceed to compile answers for each question according to the instructions below. Ensure to aggregate all the relevant answers from the multiple answer results provided in the document, and organize them sequentially by their order number, compiling the corresponding quotes, English answers, and Chinese answers for each question.

If the provided answers' quotes are not differentiated by question, ensure to break them down and assign the quotes to each respective question, outputting them separately within each question's section.

To provide a comprehensive review, differentiate the responses into quotes, English answers, and Chinese answers for each question based on the details given in the 'Answer' XML tags. Structure your review using the XML format showcased below if the answers are relevant to the questions asked:

<EnglishVersionAnswer>

The given scientific literature does not contain any information about noble metal-based catalysts (particularly Platinum) and metal oxide-based catalysts (such as CrOx, gallium, indium, vanadium, zinc, and molybdenum oxides) used in the nonoxidative dehydrogenation of light olefins. The document focuses on PtSn catalysts supported on carbon and promoted with highly-dispersed ceria for the liquid phase hydrogenation of citral. It does not discuss dehydrogenation of light olefins or compare different types of catalysts for that process. Therefore, this question cannot be answered based on the provided literature.

</EnglishVersionAnswer>

<ChineseVersionAnswer>

给定的科学文献中没有关于用于轻烯烃非氧化脱氢的贵金属催化剂(特别是铂)和金属氧化物催化剂(如CrOx、镓、铟、钒、锌和钼氧化物)的信息。该文档主要讨论了以高度分散的氧化铈促进的碳负载PtSn催化剂,用于柠檬醛的液相加氢。它没有讨论轻烯烃的脱氢或比较用于该过程的不同类型的催化剂。因此,无法根据所提供的文献回答这个问题。
