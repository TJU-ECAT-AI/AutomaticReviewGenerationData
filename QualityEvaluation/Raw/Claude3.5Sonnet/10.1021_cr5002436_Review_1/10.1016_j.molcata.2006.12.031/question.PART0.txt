Abstract
A novel kind of bimetallic PtSn catalysts supported on carbon and promoted with highly-dispersed ceria were prepared by a co-impregnation
method and tested in the liquid phase hydrogenation of citral after reduction at low (473 K) and high (773 K) temperatures. They were charac-
terized by N2 adsorption at 77 K, X-ray diffraction, temperature-programmed reduction (TPR), transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and CO
chemisorption at room temperature. Results from N2 adsorption, XRD and TEM indicated that impregnation method used here led to a highly-
dispersed ceria on carbon. Conversely to massive CeO2, TPR profile of CeO2/C showed two broad overlapped peaks at low temperatures (803 and
903 K), which are indicative of the easier reduction of the supported promoter. Addition of platinum partially promotes the reduction of surface
ceria, this indicating a close metalpromoter interaction. Ceria reducibility was increased with tin addition. The reduction treatment at 773 K
produced a strong decrease in the CO adsorption capacity in all cases, although this loss was more relevant for the monometallic catalyst. After
reduction at low temperature (473 K), the monometallic Pt/CeO2/C was the most active catalyst, while the presence of tin reduced the catalytic
activity. Reduction at high temperature (773 K) produced the decrease of activity in the case of monometallic sample while bimetallic catalysts,
specially the one with Sn/Pt = 0.25, increased the citral conversion values. Reduction treatment at 773 K also increased selectivity to unsaturated
alcohols (geraniol and nerol) of bimetallic samples, which presented in all cases higher values than their monometallic counterpart. The onset of
new PtCeOx and PtSnOx sites after the reduction process is proposed to explain the increase in activity and selectivity of bimetallic catalysts.

1. Introduction
Noble metal catalysts supported on partially reducible oxides
such as CeO2 present, under certain conditions, the strong
metalsupport interaction effect (SMSI) [1]. This effect is
mainly characterized by a deep change in chemical proper-
ties of the dispersed metal phase. Thus, strong inhibition in
chemisorptive properties and significant changes in catalytic
behaviour occur after reduction treatments at high tempera-
tures [2]. One of the most important probe reactions used to
study the existence of SMSI effect in ceria-supported and ceria-
promoted noble metal catalysts is the selective hydrogenation
of , unsaturated aldehydes [36]. In this kind of reactions,
both the activity and selectivity are generally strongly depen-

dent on the reduction temperature at which catalyst is submitted
[7]. The origin of this effect of the activation temperature on the
catalytic properties of the metal active phase has been related to
its interaction with particles of partially reduced oxide placed
at the metalsupport interface. These interactions involve the
creation of new sites able to selectively interact with the oxygen
atom in the carbonyl group, thereby activating the C O bond. In
this way, the most relevant catalytic result of these interactions
is an increase of the selectivity to the corresponding unsaturated
alcohols.
However, the use of reducible supports is not the only effec-
tive strategy to enhance the selectivity to the unsaturated alcohol
in noble metal supported catalysts. Thus, the addition of a sec-
ond more electropositive metal to the catalysts formulation leads
to similar effects [811]. In this case, the promotion relies on the
formation and stabilization of ionic forms of the second metal
situated at close vicinity of the active metal particles. These ionic
species also would lead to the activation of the C O bond, in a

similar way to that of the metal/interface active sites describing
the promotion effect of the reducible oxide support.
There is a relatively high number of studies in the litera-
ture dealing with the separate promotional effect of a partially
reducible oxide support and a second metal in the selective
hydrogenation of unsaturated aldehydes. However, the com-
bined effect of both materials on the catalytic properties of
the noble metals has received a very scarce attention [7,12,13].
In this work, we pretend to further investigate the combined
effect of two promoters (cerium oxide and tin) on the catalytic
properties of platinum in the selective hydrogenation of unsat-
urated aldehydes. To fulfil this goal, a novel kind of PtSn
bimetallic catalysts supported on carbon and promoted with
highly-dispersed ceria on was prepared. These catalysts were
tested in the liquid phase hydrogenation of citral after reduc-
tion at low (473 K) and high (773 K) temperature in order to
evaluate how the metalsupport interactions affect the catalytic
performance (activity and selectivity). The catalytic results will
be related with characterization data (N2 adsorption at 77 K,
XRD, TEM, TPR, and CO chemisorption at room temperature)
in order to obtain information relative to the nature of active sites
involved in the catalytic process.
2. Experimental
The CeO2/C support was prepared by impregnation of
the previously out-gassed carbon (Norit, B.E.T. = 790 m2 g1)
with an acetonic solution of Ce(NO3)3Â·6H2O (10 ml of solu-
tion per gram of support) with the adequate concentration to
obtain a CeO2 loading of 20 wt%. The excess of solvent was
removed by application of vacuum at room temperature. Then,
the sample was dried overnight under vacuum at 333 K and
calcined in air at 473 K. PtSn/CeO2/C catalysts were pre-
pared by co-impregnation with acetonic solutions of H2PtCl6
(JohnsonMathey) and SnCl2 (Aldrich, 98%). The excess of
solvent was again removed by application of vacuum at room
temperature. The Sn/Pt atomic ratio was varied from 0 to 0.75,
and the platinum content was 2 wt% in all samples. Thus, the cat-
alysts were labelled as Pt/CeO2/C, PtSn (0.25)/CeO2/C, PtSn
(0.5)/CeO2/C and PtSn (0.75)/CeO2/C, the number in paren-
thesesindicatingtheSn/Ptatomicratio.Nocalcinationtreatment
was applied to the catalysts before the reduction step.
The textural properties of the prepared materials were deter-
mined by nitrogen adsorption at 77 K with a Coulter Omnisorp
610 system. Before measurements, the samples were dried
at 383 K for 12 h and out-gassed at 523 K under vacuum.
The micropore volume, Vmicro, was obtained by application
of the DubininRadushkevich (DR) equation to the adsorption
isotherm. The volume of mesopores, Vmeso, was estimated by
subtracting the micropore volume from the uptake at a relative
pressure of 0.95. The surface area was calculated by application
of the B.E.T. method.
X-ray powder diffraction patterns were recorded on a JSO
Debye-flex 2002 system, from Seifert, fitted with a Cu cathode
an a Ni filter, using a 2min1 scanning rate.
Temperature-programmed reduction measurements were
carried out in a U-shaped quartz cell using a 5% H2/He gas
flow of 25 cm3 min1 and about 0.15 g of sample, with a heat-
ing rate of 10 K min1. Hydrogen consumption was followed by
on-line mass spectrometry.
Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images were
obtained with a Philips CM 120 microscope, equipped with an
energy-dispersive X-ray detector. The samples were prepared in
an ultra-microtome Reichert Ultracut.
CO chemisorption experiments were measured in a static
volumetric apparatus described is detail elsewhere [14].
The liquid phase hydrogenation of citral was carried out in
a 300 ml stirred autoclave (Autoclave Engineers, fitted with a
system for liquid sampling) at 343 K and at constant pressure
of 7 MPa. Pre-reduced catalysts (500 mg) were immersed into
90 ml of solvent (isopropanol 99%) without exposure to air
before introduction into the autoclave. After a first flush with
nitrogen and a second with hydrogen, the temperature was raised
to 343 K under 3 MPa of hydrogen. Then a mixture of substrate
(3 ml of citral) and of solvent (10 ml) was loaded into the auto-
clave through a cylinder under a 7 MPa hydrogen pressure. Zero
time was taken at this moment and stirring was switched on. Liq-
uid samples were analysed by gas chromatography on a Varian
3400 chromatograph provided with a FID detector and a capil-
lary column DB-WAX (J&W, 30 m, 0.53 mm i.d.) using nitrogen
as carrier gas.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. N2 adsorption isotherms
Fig. 1 shows the N2 adsorption isotherms at 77 K for supports
(parent carbon and CeO2/C), as well as for the PtSn/CeO2/C
catalysts. In all cases, type IV isotherms are obtained, in which
adsorption and desorption branches are not coincident. This is
indicative of the presence of a certain volume of mesopores [15]
(see Table 1). A part of the micropores of carbon were blocked
aftertheimpregnationwithceriumnitrate(Vmicro decreasesfrom
0.29 to 0.20 cm3 g1), and this is accompanied by a decrease in
B.E.T. surface area (from 790 to 552 m2 g1). This could indi-
cate that the impregnation method used here permits the cerium

inum is added, a slight decrease in surface area was observed
(from 552 to 428 m2 g1). In the case of bimetallic catalysts,
they showed very similar porosity properties and surface area
after the impregnation step.
3.2. XRD patterns
Fig. 2 shows the X-ray diffraction patterns obtained for the
CeO2/C support (after treatment in air at 473 K) as well as for the
PtSn/CeO2/C catalysts. Four peaks (dashed lines) at 2Î¸ values
of 28.6, 33.4, 47.8 and 56.7 were detected in all cases. These
peaks are produced, respectively, by the reflections of the (1 1 1),
(2 0 0), (2 2 0) and (3 3 1) crystallographic planes of the cubic
CeO2 phase [16]. The presence of broad diffraction peaks in
all cases is indicative of small CeO2 crystals (5.4 nm, estimated
from the (1 1 1) diffraction line broadening) and thus, a high
dispersion of the cerium oxide phase on the carbon support. This
value for the ceria crystal size is in good agreement with those
obtained by Silvestre-Albero et al. in Pt/CeO2SiO2 catalysts
(5.8 nm) [4]. No peaks corresponding to platinum or tin species
were detected in the XRD patterns.
3.3. Temperature-programmed reduction (TPR)
Fig. 3 shows the temperature-programmed reduction profiles
(H2 consumption) obtained with the CeO2/C support and the
PtSn/CeO2/C catalysts. The TPR profile of CeO2/C exhib-
ited two broad overlapped peaks centred at around 803 and

903 K, respectively. The typical TPR profile for unsupported
CeO2 includes two reduction peaks, a small one at low temper-
ature (773823 K) and the second one, much more prominent,
at higher temperatures (11631173 K), which are respectively
associated to the reduction of surface and bulk ceria [3,17,18].
Furthermore, it has been observed that the size of the reduction
peak at low temperature increases with the surface area of CeO2
[19,20]. In the present case, only a continuous reduction process
was observed at low temperatures (773873 K). This could be
indicative, as already pointed out, of a high dispersion of cerium
oxide on the carbon support, with a very small CeO2 particle
size; this would lead to an easier reduction of ceria phase with
respect to the unsupported oxide.
In the case of Pt/CeO2/C, the reduction profile showed the
onset of one new reduction peak at lower temperature (531 K),
while the two big overlapped peaks are shifted to lower tem-
peratures (726 and 878 K). This indicates that the presence
of platinum partially promotes the reduction of ceria via spill
over of hydrogen from platinum particles to the support [3,21].
Thus, the peak at lower temperature can be assigned to the
surface reduction of CeO2 in close contact with platinum, this
accounting for a strong interaction between the metallic phase
and cerium oxide in this catalyst. The reduction profiles for
the bimetallic PtSn/CeO2/C catalysts showed the same feature
than the monometallic Pt/CeO2/C, with a peak at low tempera-
ture (503513 K) and two broad overlapped reduction peaks at
around 723 and 873 K. It is interesting to observe that the size
of the peak at low temperature was higher for bimetallic cat-
alyst than for the monometallic counterpart. Furthermore, the
area of this low temperature peak increased with the tin con-
tent. This could be indicative of reduction of ionic tin species,
although the tin loading in catalysts is too low to produce such
increase only by itself. This reduction peak, as in the case of the
monometallic sample, can be also due to the surface reduction of
cerium oxide in close contact with platinum. Thus, it seems that
the presence of tin facilitates the transport of hydrogen via spill
over from the platinum surface to the ceria particles in close con-
tact with metal. This fact indicates that the reducibility of ceria
is improved in the case of bimetallic catalysts, as previously
reported [4,14,22].

It should be noted that, as indicated with dashed lines in
Fig. 3, reduction treatment at 473 K should not produce appre-
ciable ceria reduction in the catalysts under study. However,
the treatment at high temperature (773 K) is enough to pro-
duce the surface reduction of ceria and only the bulk part of
the oxide, represented by the second of the overlapped peaks,
remain unreduced after this treatment. This fact implies the cre-
ation of oxygen vacancies (CeOx) and the presence of Ce3+ ions
located principally in the vicinity of platinum particles. With
regard to tin, the reduction profiles of bimetallic catalysts did
not permit to establish a specific zone where tin is reduced. It
seems clear that tin enhances the surface ceria reduction process
but, at the same time, it is has been previously observed that the
presence of cerium retards the reduction of tin, which remains
mainly as ionic tin after a reduction treatment at 773 K [14,22].
3.4. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM)
Fig. 4 shows the TEM images for the Pt/CeO2/C catalyst, as
a representative sample. Dark zones are due to cerium oxide,
while light parts indicate the presence of carbon. From the low
magnification pictures (Fig. 4a and b) it can be seen that cerium
oxide is well spread on the carbon surface. It is also well appreci-
ated in Fig. 4b that a thin film of CeO2 entirely covers the carbon
particle, reaching almost all its porosity. This would indicate, as
we have pointed above, that the preparation method used here
leads to a highly-dispersed CeO2 phase on carbon support. In
order to evaluate the degree of dispersion of ceria on the carbon
support a set of high magnification images (including the ones
represented in Fig. 4c and d) were analyzed for the represen-
tative sample Pt/CeO2/C in fresh and reduced at 773 K states.

TEM: (a) fresh and (b) reduced at 773 K.
Thus, a great number of ceria particles were measured and the
results of these analyses are exposed in Fig. 5. It can be seen
that the particle size distribution for the fresh sample (Fig. 5a) is
centred around 45 nm (average size 4.5 nm), in good agreement
with the mean ceria crystal size estimated from the (1 1 1) XRD
line broadening (5.4 nm) showed in a previous section. After the
reduction treatment at high temperature (773 K), a broader parti-
cle size distribution was obtained (Fig. 5b), with a higher average
size (5.9 nm) and the main part of ceria particles being larger
than 5 nm. This is a clear evidence of a sintering of the partially
reduced ceria phase upon the thermal reduction treatment, which
has been previously reported for carbon supported CeO2Pt cat-
alysts [23]. Since the dark CeO2 phase almost totally surrounds
the carbon particles, it was not possible to distinguish the pres-
ence of platinum and/or tin in any case. Thus, in order to evaluate
the platinum dispersion on the catalysts surface, alternative mea-
surements such as CO chemisorption at room temperature were
used.
3.5. CO chemisorption at room temperature
Fig. 6 shows the CO chemisorption isotherms at room tem-
perature for the catalysts under study, reduced at both 473
and 773 K. It can be seen that reduction treatment at high
temperature produced a decrease in the CO adsorption capac-
ity in all cases. However, this drop is more relevant for the
monometallic sample. A strong interaction of the platinum crys-
tallites with particles of partially reduced ceria (CeOx) placed
at the metalsupport interface can account for the observed
decrease in the CO uptake. This interaction could involve elec-
tronic (from the reduced ceria particles to platinum aggregates)
and geometric (covering of platinum particles by patches of
reduced ceria) effects, although the latter has been probed to

need higher reduction temperatures than the used in the present
work (973 K) [1]. Furthermore, taking into account the results
of the previous section, a certain contribution of encapsulation
of platinum particles associated with ceria sintering cannot be
ruled out.
In the case of bimetallic samples, the treatment at low tem-
perature (473 K) already produces a decrease in CO uptakes
with regard to monometallic catalyst. This could be due to
a covering of platinum particles by ionic tin species. Thus,
the co-impregnation method used here would permit a close
interaction between both metals even after such a low reduc-
tion temperature. After reduction at high temperature, besides
ceria, tin also can contribute to the blocking of platinum sites
accounting for the loss of CO adsorption capacity in bimetallic
samples.
It is necessary to have in mind that a parallel adsorption of
CO on ceria could also take place. However, it is well known that
the use of chlorinated metal precursors strongly decreases the
magnitude and the rate of CO adsorption on ceria. Furthermore,
the very low CO pressures at which the adsorption isotherms
have been measured may limit the extent of parallel CO adsorp-
tion by the support. Thus, the weight of this parallel adsorption
of CO on ceria in the global adsorption process would not be
relevant.
3.6. Catalytic behaviour
Fig. 7 shows the main reactions pathways that can occur
during citral hydrogenation. The hydrogenation of the carbonyl
group gives the corresponding unsaturated alcohols (nerol and
geraniol), whereas the hydrogenation of the conjugated C C
bond gives citronellal. Consecutive hydrogenation leads to cit-
ronellol and finally to the saturated alcohol 3,7-dimethyloctanol.
At the same time, citronellal can produce secondary products
by processes of cyclization (iso-pulegol) or reaction with the
solvent (acetals of citronellal). These side reactions have been
probed to take place in acid sites situated on the support [7]
and thus, their formation strongly depends on the nature and

even of the surface area of the material [24]. Under the experi-
mental conditions used in the present work, the main products
observed were citronellal, the unsaturated alcohols (geraniol and
nerol) and the saturated alcohol citronellol. The production of
side products was low in our catalysts, this fact being previously
related to the presence of cerium [25].
Fig. 8a shows the citral conversion as function of time for the
catalysts previously reduced at 473 K. It can be observed that a
rapid hydrogenation of citral occurs during the first 30 min and,
after this earlier period, the citral conversion reaches a stable
value in all cases. This deactivation observed could be related to
processes of citral decomposition or of poisoning of active sites
responsible for hydrogenation by CO and carbonaceous species
yielding from reactions of the formed unsaturated alcohols
[2629]. Pt/CeO2/C was the most active catalyst after reduc-
tion at 473 K, reaching a citral conversion value close to 100%
after 30 min of reaction. With regard to bimetallic catalysts, they
showed lower conversion values that the monometallic sam-
ple in all the range of reaction times. Furthermore, the higher
tin content in catalysts the lower citral conversion values were
found. Since at such low reduction temperature no SMSI effect
was expected to occur, this could be due to a lower number of
accessible platinum active sites for citral hydrogenation after
tin addition, in good agreement with the results exposed in the
previous section.
When the catalysts were reduced at 773 K (Fig. 8b) a simi-
lar conversionreaction time profile was observed in all cases.
The conversion followed the order: Pt/CeO2/C > PtSn(0.25)/
CeO2/C > PtSn(0.5)/CeO2/C PtSn(0.75)/CeO2/C. How-
ever, if conversion values after reduction at both low and
high temperatures are compared, different behaviours could
be observed. On one hand, citral conversion decreased for
monometallic Pt/CeO2/C after reduction at high temperature.
The strong interaction of reduced ceria particles with platinum
after this treatment would produce the decrease in the number of
available sites for hydrogenation (Fig. 6), with the subsequent
loss of activity. In the case of bimetallic samples, the decrease in
COsaturationcoverage(Fig.6)isnotaccompaniedbyadecrease
in activity, but it increases with the reduction temperature. This
increase is relevant for sample with Sn/Pt = 0.25 (from 35 to
54% conversion at 30 min of reaction) and less pronounced for
the other two bimetallic catalysts. It seems that the reduction
treatment at high temperature favours the creation of new active
sites for the hydrogenation of citral accounting for the increase
in conversion values.
In order to add light to the nature of these new active sites, the
effect of the reduction temperature on the selectivity toward the
unsaturated alcohols was also evaluated (Fig. 9). It is remarkable
that the reduction treatment at 773 K enhanced the selectivity to
unsaturated alcohols in all cases. Furthermore, bimetallic cata-
lysts showed higher selectivities that the monometallic sample.
In the case of Pt/CeO2/C the beneficial effect (in terms of selec-
tivity) observed after reduction at 773 K could be explained by
two effects of the CeO2 promoter: on one hand, the creation of
new PtCeOx sites at the metalsupport interface acting as acid
Lewis sites able to activate the C O bond of the citral molecule;
on the other hand, some authors have proposed the existence of
an electronic interaction between the reduced ceria particles and
the active metal which leads to an increase in electron density of
platinum particles with the subsequent weakening of adsorption
of citral via the C C bond [25,30,31]. With regard to bimetal-

lic catalysts, the additive presence of Snn+ species, also able
to act as Lewis acid sites, on the surface of platinum particles
and/or in their close vicinity could account for the increase in
selectivity to unsaturated alcohols with reduction temperature.
The increase of conversion after reduction at high temperature
in these catalysts could be also explained by the creation of new
PtSnn+ sites active for hydrogenation of the C O bond in the
citral molecule.
4. Conclusions
A novel kind of bimetallic PtSn catalysts supported on
carbon and promoted by highly-dispersed ceria were prepared
by a co-impregnation method and tested in the liquid phase
hydrogenation of citral after reduction at low (473 K) and high
temperature (773 K). N2 adsorption at 77 K indicated that the
impregnation method used here allows the cerium precursor to
reach the main part of the carbon porosity. XRD and TEM data
also supported that cerium dioxide is in a highly-dispersed state
on the carbon support. The TPR profile of the CeO2/C support
included two broad low temperature reduction peaks, this indi-
cating a small CeO2 crystal size. TPR data from Pt/CeO2/C
indicated that Pt and cerium are in close contact. When tin
is added, ceria reducibility was increased. After reduction at
low temperature (473 K), the monometallic Pt/CeO2/C was the
most active catalyst, while the presence of tin reduced catalytic
activity, in agreement with the results of CO chemisorption
indicating a lower availability of platinum sites. Reduction at
high temperature (773 K) produced the decrease of activity in
the case of the monometallic sample, while bimetallic catalysts
increased their conversion values. Reduction at 773 K increased
the selectivity to unsaturated alcohols (geraniol and nerol) in all
cases, although bimetallic catalysts showed higher values than
the monometallic sample. The presence of new PtCeOx and
PtSnOx sites after reduction at high temperature is proposed
to explain the increase in activity and selectivity for bimetallic
catalysts.
