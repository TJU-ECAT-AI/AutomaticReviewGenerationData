The literature does not provide sufficient information to fully compare and contrast noble metal-based catalysts (particularly Platinum) and metal oxide-based catalysts for the nonoxidative dehydrogenation of light olefins. The document primarily focuses on platinum-tin catalysts supported on different materials for propane dehydrogenation. 

The literature mentions that supported platinum-tin catalysts have been studied extensively due to their high activity and selectivity in propane dehydrogenation. Their catalytic properties depend on the interaction between Pt and Sn, the chemical state of Sn, and the support effect. 

The document briefly mentions that supported Pt or Cr catalysts have been studied for propane dehydrogenation, but does not provide detailed information on other metal oxide-based catalysts such as gallium, indium, vanadium, zinc, and molybdenum oxides.

The literature does not provide information on the industrial applications, recent developments, or potential advantages of these different catalyst types in the field of light olefin dehydrogenation.

The given scientific literature does not contain information to directly compare and contrast noble metal-based catalysts (particularly Platinum) and metal oxide-based catalysts for the nonoxidative dehydrogenation of light olefins. The document focuses specifically on bimetallic Pt-Sn catalysts supported on different materials for propane dehydrogenation. It does not discuss other metal oxide catalysts like CrOx, gallium, indium, vanadium, zinc, or molybdenum oxides.

The literature provides some insights into platinum-based catalysts:

1. Composition: The study examines bimetallic Pt-Sn catalysts supported on different materials (ZSM-5, γ-Al2O3, mesoporous alumina, SBA-15).

2. Effectiveness: The catalysts show varying degrees of effectiveness depending on the support material. The PtSn/MA (mesoporous alumina) catalyst exhibited relatively high reaction stability and selectivity.

3. Recent developments: The research focuses on understanding the influence of different supports on catalytic structure and performance.

4. Potential advantages: The study highlights the importance of support material in determining textural properties, acid content, metal particle distribution, and interactions between platinum and tin species.

However, the document does not provide information to compare these platinum-based catalysts with metal oxide-based catalysts for light olefin dehydrogenation. It also does not discuss industrial applications beyond mentioning that propene is an important raw material for various products.

The literature primarily focuses on platinum-based catalysts, particularly Pt-Sn bimetallic catalysts, for the dehydrogenation of light olefins. It does not provide a comprehensive comparison with metal oxide-based catalysts.

Composition: The main catalysts discussed are supported platinum-tin catalysts. The support materials mentioned include ZSM-5, γ-Al2O3, mesoporous alumina, and SBA-15.

Effectiveness: Pt-Sn catalysts are reported to show relatively high activity and selectivity in the dehydrogenation process.

Industrial applications: The paper does not explicitly discuss industrial applications of these catalysts.

Recent developments: The study itself represents recent research into the effects of different supports on Pt-Sn catalyst performance for propane dehydrogenation.

Potential advantages: The catalytic properties of Pt-Sn catalysts depend on the interaction between Pt and Sn, the chemical state of Sn, and the support effect. Different supports can modify selectivity and influence the properties of the metallic phase.

The document briefly mentions chromium-based catalysts but does not provide detailed information about other metal oxide catalysts like gallium, indium, vanadium, zinc, or molybdenum oxides. Therefore, a comprehensive comparison between noble metal-based and metal oxide-based catalysts cannot be made based solely on this literature.

The literature primarily focuses on platinum-tin catalysts supported on various materials for propane dehydrogenation, rather than providing a comprehensive comparison of noble metal-based and metal oxide-based catalysts for light olefin dehydrogenation. However, some relevant information can be extracted:

Composition: The study examines platinum-tin catalysts supported on different materials like ZSM-5, γ-Al2O3, mesoporous alumina, and SBA-15.

Effectiveness: Supported platinum-tin catalysts show relatively high activity and selectivity in propane dehydrogenation.

Industrial applications: Propane dehydrogenation is important for producing propene, which is used to make polypropene, acrolein, polyacrylonitrile, and acrylic acid.

Recent developments: Research has explored using various support materials like zeolites (ZSM-5) and mesoporous materials (SBA-15, mesoporous alumina) to improve catalyst performance.

The literature also briefly mentions chromium catalysts as being studied for propane dehydrogenation, but does not provide details on other metal oxide catalysts like gallium, indium, vanadium, zinc, or molybdenum oxides.

Overall, the document does not provide sufficient information to fully compare noble metal-based and metal oxide-based catalysts for light olefin dehydrogenation across all the requested aspects.
