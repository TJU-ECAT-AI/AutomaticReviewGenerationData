[1] "Among several reported catalysts, supported platinumtin catalysts have been studied in depth since they show relatively high activity and selectivity in the process [811]."

[2] "In general, the catalytic properties of the PtSn catalysts strongly depend on the interaction between Pt and Sn, the chemical state of Sn, and the support effect [12]."

[3] "Alumina has been used as an adsorbent, catalyst or catalyst support due to its desirable textual properties and surface acid-base properties. For instance, -Al2O3 supported PtSn catalyst is commonly used in reforming or dehydrogenation process [16]."

[4] "Compared with the conventional support of -Al2O3, ZSM-5 zeolite has some unique physical properties, such as the special three-dimensional channel, adjusted Si Al ratio and relatively large surface area [18]."

[5] "Besides, some mesoporous materials, such as SBA-15 and mesoporous alumina are often used as the catalyst support to disperse active phase with more active sites."

The literature provided does not contain sufficient information to fully compare and contrast noble metal-based catalysts and metal oxide-based catalysts for light olefin dehydrogenation. The text focuses primarily on platinum-tin catalysts supported on various materials.

Based on the available information:

1. Composition: The main catalyst discussed is platinum-tin supported on various materials like alumina, ZSM-5 zeolite, and mesoporous materials (SBA-15, mesoporous alumina).

2. Effectiveness: Supported platinum-tin catalysts are reported to show relatively high activity and selectivity in the dehydrogenation process.

3. Industrial applications: Platinum-tin catalysts supported on γ-Al2O3 are commonly used in reforming and dehydrogenation processes.

4. Recent developments: The use of different supports like ZSM-5 zeolite, SBA-15, and mesoporous alumina is being explored to improve catalyst performance. These supports offer unique properties such as special pore structures, adjustable composition, and high surface areas.

5. Potential advantages: Different supports can influence the dispersion of active metals, the interaction between platinum and tin, and the overall catalytic properties. Mesoporous materials, in particular, are noted for their ability to disperse the active phase and provide more active sites.

The document does not provide information on metal oxide-based catalysts like chromium, gallium, indium, vanadium, zinc, or molybdenum oxides for comparison.
