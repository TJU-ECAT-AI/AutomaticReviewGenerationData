[1] "Among several reported catalysts, supported platinumtin catalysts have been studied in depth since they show relatively high activity and selectivity in the process [811]."

[2] "In general, the catalytic properties of the PtSn catalysts strongly depend on the interaction between Pt and Sn, the chemical state of Sn, and the support effect [12]."

[3] "Recently, extensive studies have been made on supported Pt or Cr catalysts [46]."

The literature does not provide sufficient information to fully compare and contrast noble metal-based catalysts (particularly Platinum) and metal oxide-based catalysts for the nonoxidative dehydrogenation of light olefins. The document primarily focuses on platinum-tin catalysts supported on different materials for propane dehydrogenation. 

The literature mentions that supported platinum-tin catalysts have been studied extensively due to their high activity and selectivity in propane dehydrogenation. Their catalytic properties depend on the interaction between Pt and Sn, the chemical state of Sn, and the support effect. 

The document briefly mentions that supported Pt or Cr catalysts have been studied for propane dehydrogenation, but does not provide detailed information on other metal oxide-based catalysts such as gallium, indium, vanadium, zinc, and molybdenum oxides.

The literature does not provide information on the industrial applications, recent developments, or potential advantages of these different catalyst types in the field of light olefin dehydrogenation.

该文献并未提供足够的信息来全面比较和对比贵金属基催化剂(特别是铂)和金属氧化物基催化剂在轻烯烃非氧化脱氢中的应用。该文档主要关注不同材料支撑的铂-锡催化剂在丙烷脱氢中的应用。

文献提到,由于在丙烷脱氢中具有高活性和选择性,负载型铂-锡催化剂已经被广泛研究。它们的催化性能取决于Pt和Sn之间的相互作用、Sn的化学状态以及载体效应。

该文档简要提到了负载型Pt或Cr催化剂在丙烷脱氢中的研究,但没有提供关于其他金属氧化物基催化剂(如镓、铟、钒、锌和钼氧化物)的详细信息。

该文献没有提供这些不同类型催化剂在轻烯烃脱氢领域的工业应用、最新发展或潜在优势的信息。
