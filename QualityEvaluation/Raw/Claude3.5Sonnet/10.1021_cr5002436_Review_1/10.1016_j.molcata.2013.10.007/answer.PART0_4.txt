[1] "Among several reported catalysts, supported platinumtin catalysts have been studied in depth since they show relatively high activity and selectivity in the process [811]."

[2] "Compared with the conventional support of -Al2O3, ZSM-5 zeolite has some unique physical properties, such as the special three-dimensional channel, adjusted Si Al ratio and relatively large surface area [18]."

[3] "Besides, some mesoporous materials, such as SBA-15 and mesoporous alumina are often used as the catalyst support to disperse active phase with more active sites."

[4] "The catalytic dehydrogenation of propane is of increasing importance because of the growing demand for propene [13]. Indeed, propene is an important raw material for the production of polypropene, acrolein, polyacrylonitrile and acrylic acid. Recently, extensive studies have been made on supported Pt or Cr catalysts [46]."

The literature primarily focuses on platinum-tin catalysts supported on various materials for propane dehydrogenation, rather than providing a comprehensive comparison of noble metal-based and metal oxide-based catalysts for light olefin dehydrogenation. However, some relevant information can be extracted:

Composition: The study examines platinum-tin catalysts supported on different materials like ZSM-5, γ-Al2O3, mesoporous alumina, and SBA-15.

Effectiveness: Supported platinum-tin catalysts show relatively high activity and selectivity in propane dehydrogenation.

Industrial applications: Propane dehydrogenation is important for producing propene, which is used to make polypropene, acrolein, polyacrylonitrile, and acrylic acid.

Recent developments: Research has explored using various support materials like zeolites (ZSM-5) and mesoporous materials (SBA-15, mesoporous alumina) to improve catalyst performance.

The literature also briefly mentions chromium catalysts as being studied for propane dehydrogenation, but does not provide details on other metal oxide catalysts like gallium, indium, vanadium, zinc, or molybdenum oxides.

Overall, the document does not provide sufficient information to fully compare noble metal-based and metal oxide-based catalysts for light olefin dehydrogenation across all the requested aspects.

该文献主要集中于研究在不同材料上负载的铂-锡催化剂用于丙烷脱氢，而不是对用于轻烯烃脱氢的贵金属基和金属氧化物基催化剂进行全面比较。然而，可以提取一些相关信息：

组成：该研究考察了负载在不同材料上的铂-锡催化剂，如ZSM-5、γ-Al2O3、介孔氧化铝和SBA-15。

有效性：负载型铂-锡催化剂在丙烷脱氢过程中表现出相对较高的活性和选择性。

工业应用：丙烷脱氢对于生产丙烯很重要，丙烯用于制造聚丙烯、丙烯醛、聚丙烯腈和丙烯酸。

最新发展：研究已探索使用各种载体材料，如沸石（ZSM-5）和介孔材料（SBA-15、介孔氧化铝）来改善催化剂性能。

文献还简要提到了铬催化剂被研究用于丙烷脱氢，但未提供关于其他金属氧化物催化剂（如镓、铟、钒、锌或钼氧化物）的详细信息。

总的来说，该文档没有提供足够的信息来全面比较贵金属基和金属氧化物基催化剂在轻烯烃脱氢方面的所有要求方面。
