Read the questions and answers provided below. First, critically assess the overall relevance of the answers provided to the set of questions asked.

If, upon your assessment, you find that the answers do not contain information that is relevant to the questions asked, stop your review process immediately and respond with a single sentence: "※※※※※※※The provided answers are not relevant to the questions.※※※※※※※". Do not provide any additional explanation or background information, only this sentence should be given as a response in case of irrelevant answers.

If, however, the answers are relevant to the questions asked, proceed to compile answers for each question according to the instructions below. Ensure to aggregate all the relevant answers from the multiple answer results provided in the document, and organize them sequentially by their order number, compiling the corresponding quotes, English answers, and Chinese answers for each question.

If the provided answers' quotes are not differentiated by question, ensure to break them down and assign the quotes to each respective question, outputting them separately within each question's section.

To provide a comprehensive review, differentiate the responses into quotes, English answers, and Chinese answers for each question based on the details given in the 'Answer' XML tags. Structure your review using the XML format showcased below if the answers are relevant to the questions asked:

The given literature does not contain any relevant information to compare and contrast noble metal-based catalysts (particularly Platinum) and metal oxide-based catalysts (such as CrOx, gallium, indium, vanadium, zinc, and molybdenum oxides) used in the nonoxidative dehydrogenation of light olefins. The document focuses on the synthesis and characterization of platinum nanoparticles supported on mesoporous SBA-15 silica, and their use in ethylene hydrogenation and ethane hydrogenolysis reactions. It does not discuss metal oxide catalysts or nonoxidative dehydrogenation of light olefins.

<EnglishVersionAnswer>

The provided literature does not contain information about noble metal-based catalysts versus metal oxide-based catalysts for light olefin dehydrogenation. The document primarily discusses the synthesis and characterization of platinum nanoparticles supported on mesoporous silica (Pt/SBA-15) and their use as catalysts for ethylene hydrogenation and ethane hydrogenolysis. It does not cover the nonoxidative dehydrogenation of light olefins or compare platinum catalysts to metal oxide catalysts for this reaction. Therefore, I cannot provide a comparison of these catalyst types or discuss their compositions, effectiveness, industrial applications, recent developments, and potential advantages in nonoxidative dehydrogenation based on the given information.
