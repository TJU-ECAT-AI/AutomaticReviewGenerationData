[1] "The PtZn system resembles in some aspects the PtSn system. Platinum and zinc can also form alloy phases of different stoichiometries (PtZn, Pt3Zn, among others), which may show distinctive catalytic behaviour as compared to monometallic platinum."

[2] "For example, it has been reported that Pt/ZnO catalysts can achieve 99% selectivity at 45% conversion in the dehydrogenation of iso-butane to iso-butene at 723 K [23]."

[3] "The bimetallic catalyst, with a bulk Zn/Pt atomic ratio of 13.7, showed a much higher initial activity in crotonaldehyde hydrogenation, although it deactivated more strongly with time on stream."

[4] "On the other hand, the catalytic behaviour for iso-butane dehydrogenation was greatly improved by the presence of zinc, the bimetallic catalyst being more active than its monometallic counterpart and showing 100% selectivity to iso-butene."

The literature primarily focuses on platinum-based catalysts, particularly Pt-Zn systems, for dehydrogenation reactions. It does not provide extensive information on metal oxide-based catalysts like CrOx, gallium, indium, vanadium, and molybdenum oxides for comparison.

For platinum-based catalysts:

Composition: The study discusses Pt-Zn bimetallic catalysts, which can form alloy phases like PtZn and Pt3Zn.

Effectiveness: Pt-Zn catalysts show improved performance compared to monometallic Pt catalysts. For iso-butane dehydrogenation, a Pt/ZnO catalyst achieved 99% selectivity at 45% conversion at 723 K. The bimetallic Pt-Zn catalyst showed higher activity and 100% selectivity to iso-butene compared to the monometallic Pt catalyst.

Industrial applications: The catalysts were tested for iso-butane dehydrogenation and crotonaldehyde hydrogenation.

Recent developments: The study explored the modification of Pt catalysts with Zn to enhance their catalytic behavior.

Potential advantages: Pt-Zn catalysts show higher selectivity and activity in dehydrogenation reactions compared to monometallic Pt catalysts.

The literature does not provide sufficient information to compare these Pt-based catalysts with metal oxide-based catalysts for light olefin dehydrogenation.

该文献主要关注铂基催化剂，特别是Pt-Zn系统在脱氢反应中的应用。它没有提供足够的信息来比较CrOx、镓、铟、钒和钼氧化物等金属氧化物基催化剂。

对于铂基催化剂：

组成：研究讨论了Pt-Zn双金属催化剂，它们可以形成PtZn和Pt3Zn等合金相。

有效性：Pt-Zn催化剂比单金属Pt催化剂表现更好。在异丁烷脱氢反应中，Pt/ZnO催化剂在723 K下实现了45%转化率下的99%选择性。双金属Pt-Zn催化剂与单金属Pt催化剂相比，表现出更高的活性和100%的异丁烯选择性。

工业应用：这些催化剂被用于异丁烷脱氢和巴豆醛加氢反应的测试。

最新发展：研究探索了用Zn改性Pt催化剂以增强其催化行为。

潜在优势：与单金属Pt催化剂相比，Pt-Zn催化剂在脱氢反应中表现出更高的选择性和活性。

该文献没有提供足够的信息来比较这些Pt基催化剂与金属氧化物基催化剂在轻烯烃脱氢方面的性能。
