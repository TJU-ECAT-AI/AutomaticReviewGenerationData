[1] "The PtZn system resembles in some aspects the PtSn system. Platinum and zinc can also form alloy phases of different stoichiometries (PtZn, Pt3Zn, among others), which may show distinctive catalytic behaviour as compared to monometallic platinum."

[2] "For example, it has been reported that Pt/ZnO catalysts can achieve 99% selectivity at 45% conversion in the dehydrogenation of iso-butane to iso-butene at 723 K [23]."

[3] "The bimetallic catalysts showed enhanced selectivity towards the hydrogenation of the C O bond of crotonaldehyde as compared to the monometallic platinum catalyst, although the catalytic activity was considerably reduced."

[4] "On the other hand, the catalytic behaviour for iso-butane dehydrogenation was greatly improved by the presence of zinc, the bimetallic catalyst being more active than its monometallic counterpart and showing 100% selectivity to iso-butene."

The literature primarily focuses on platinum-based catalysts, particularly Pt-Zn systems, for dehydrogenation reactions. It does not provide a comprehensive comparison with metal oxide-based catalysts like CrOx, gallium, indium, vanadium, and molybdenum oxides.

For platinum-based catalysts:

1. Composition: The study discusses Pt-Zn bimetallic catalysts, which can form alloy phases like PtZn and Pt3Zn.

2. Effectiveness: Pt/ZnO catalysts show high selectivity (99%) and good conversion (45%) in the dehydrogenation of iso-butane to iso-butene at 723 K. The presence of zinc greatly improves the catalytic behavior compared to monometallic platinum catalysts.

3. Industrial applications: The catalysts are used for iso-butane dehydrogenation to produce iso-butene.

4. Recent developments: The study shows that bimetallic Pt-Zn catalysts supported on activated carbon demonstrate improved performance in iso-butane dehydrogenation compared to monometallic Pt catalysts.

5. Potential advantages: Pt-Zn catalysts show higher activity and 100% selectivity to iso-butene in dehydrogenation reactions compared to monometallic Pt catalysts.

The literature does not provide information on metal oxide-based catalysts for comparison. To fully answer the question, additional sources would be needed to discuss CrOx, gallium, indium, vanadium, zinc, and molybdenum oxide catalysts in the context of light olefin dehydrogenation.

这篇文献主要关注铂基催化剂，特别是Pt-Zn系统在脱氢反应中的应用。它没有提供与金属氧化物基催化剂（如CrOx、镓、铟、钒、锌和钼氧化物）的全面比较。

对于铂基催化剂：

1. 成分：研究讨论了Pt-Zn双金属催化剂，它们可以形成PtZn和Pt3Zn等合金相。

2. 有效性：Pt/ZnO催化剂在723 K下进行异丁烷脱氢生成异丁烯的反应中显示出高选择性（99%）和良好的转化率（45%）。锌的存在大大改善了催化性能，相比于单金属铂催化剂。

3. 工业应用：这些催化剂用于异丁烷脱氢生产异丁烯。

4. 最新发展：研究表明，以活性炭为载体的双金属Pt-Zn催化剂在异丁烷脱氢反应中表现出比单金属Pt催化剂更好的性能。

5. 潜在优势：在脱氢反应中，Pt-Zn催化剂比单金属Pt催化剂表现出更高的活性和100%的异丁烯选择性。

文献没有提供关于金属氧化物基催化剂的信息以供比较。要全面回答这个问题，还需要额外的资料来讨论CrOx、镓、铟、钒、锌和钼氧化物催化剂在轻烯烃脱氢背景下的情况。
