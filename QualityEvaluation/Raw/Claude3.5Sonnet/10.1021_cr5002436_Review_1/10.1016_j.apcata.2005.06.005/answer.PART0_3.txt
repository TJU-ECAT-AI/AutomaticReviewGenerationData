[1] "The modification of the catalytic behaviour of a noble metal through the addition of a second non-active metal able to form alloy phases or intermetallic compounds with the former is an interesting field in heterogeneous catalysis."

[2] "It has been reported that Pt/ZnO catalysts can achieve 99% selectivity at 45% conversion in the dehydrogenation of iso-butane to iso-butene at 723 K [23]."

[3] "On the other hand, the catalytic behaviour for iso-butane dehydrogenation was greatly improved by the presence of zinc, the bimetallic catalyst being more active than its monometallic counterpart and showing 100% selectivity to iso-butene."

The literature primarily focuses on platinum-based catalysts for dehydrogenation reactions, particularly the addition of zinc to platinum. It does not provide a comprehensive comparison with metal oxide-based catalysts.

For platinum-based catalysts:

1. Composition: The study discusses platinum catalysts modified with zinc, forming PtZn alloy phases or intermetallic compounds.

2. Effectiveness: Pt/ZnO catalysts showed high selectivity (99%) at 45% conversion for iso-butane dehydrogenation to iso-butene at 723 K. The presence of zinc greatly improved catalytic behavior, with bimetallic Pt-Zn catalysts being more active than monometallic Pt and showing 100% selectivity to iso-butene.

3. Industrial applications: The paper mentions the use of platinum-tin systems in naphtha reforming and alkane dehydrogenation reactions.

4. Recent developments: The study focuses on the modification of platinum with zinc, highlighting the formation of PtZn alloy phases and their impact on catalyst performance.

5. Potential advantages: The addition of zinc to platinum enhances selectivity and activity in dehydrogenation reactions, particularly for iso-butane to iso-butene conversion.

The document does not provide information on CrOx, gallium, indium, vanadium, or molybdenum oxide catalysts for light olefin dehydrogenation. Therefore, a comprehensive comparison cannot be made based solely on this literature.

该文献主要关注了用于脱氢反应的铂基催化剂，特别是向铂中添加锌的情况。它没有提供与金属氧化物基催化剂的全面比较。

对于铂基催化剂：

1. 成分：研究讨论了用锌改性的铂催化剂，形成PtZn合金相或金属间化合物。

2. 有效性：Pt/ZnO催化剂在723 K下进行异丁烷脱氢生成异丁烯的反应中，在45%转化率时显示出99%的选择性。锌的存在极大地改善了催化行为，双金属Pt-Zn催化剂比单金属Pt更活跃，对异丁烯的选择性达到100%。

3. 工业应用：文章提到了铂-锡系统在石脑油重整和烷烃脱氢反应中的应用。

4. 最新发展：研究集中在用锌改性铂上，强调了PtZn合金相的形成及其对催化剂性能的影响。

5. 潜在优势：向铂中添加锌可以提高脱氢反应的选择性和活性，特别是在异丁烷到异丁烯的转化中。

该文档没有提供关于CrOx、镓、铟、钒或钼氧化物催化剂用于轻烯烃脱氢的信息。因此，仅基于这篇文献无法进行全面的比较。
