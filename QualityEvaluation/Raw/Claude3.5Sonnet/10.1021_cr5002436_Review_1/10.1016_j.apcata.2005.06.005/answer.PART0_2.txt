[1] "The PtZn system resembles in some aspects the PtSn system. Platinum and zinc can also form alloy phases of different stoichiometries (PtZn, Pt3Zn, among others), which may show distinctive catalytic behaviour as compared to monometallic platinum."

[2] "It has been reported that Pt/ZnO catalysts can achieve 99% selectivity at 45% conversion in the dehydrogenation of iso-butane to iso-butene at 723 K [23]."

[3] "The bimetallic catalysts showed enhanced selectivity towards the hydrogenation of the C O bond of crotonaldehyde as compared to the monometallic platinum catalyst, although the catalytic activity was considerably reduced."

[4] "On the other hand, the catalytic behaviour for iso-butane dehydrogenation was greatly improved by the presence of zinc, the bimetallic catalyst being more active than its monometallic counterpart and showing 100% selectivity to iso-butene."

The literature primarily discusses platinum-based catalysts, particularly Pt-Zn systems, for dehydrogenation reactions. It does not provide comprehensive information on metal oxide-based catalysts like CrOx, gallium, indium, vanadium, and molybdenum oxides for comparison.

For platinum-based catalysts:

1. Composition: The study focuses on Pt-Zn bimetallic catalysts, which can form alloy phases like PtZn and Pt3Zn.

2. Effectiveness: Pt-Zn catalysts show improved performance in iso-butane dehydrogenation compared to monometallic Pt catalysts. They achieve higher activity and 100% selectivity to iso-butene.

3. Industrial applications: These catalysts are used in iso-butane dehydrogenation to produce iso-butene.

4. Recent developments: The study demonstrates that adding zinc to platinum catalysts enhances their catalytic behavior in dehydrogenation reactions.

5. Potential advantages: Pt-Zn catalysts offer higher selectivity and activity compared to monometallic Pt catalysts in dehydrogenation reactions.

The literature does not provide sufficient information to compare these platinum-based catalysts with metal oxide-based catalysts for light olefin dehydrogenation.

该文献主要讨论了铂基催化剂，特别是Pt-Zn系统在脱氢反应中的应用。它没有提供关于CrOx、镓、铟、钒和钼氧化物等金属氧化物基催化剂的全面信息以供比较。

对于铂基催化剂：

1. 组成：研究重点是Pt-Zn双金属催化剂，它们可以形成PtZn和Pt3Zn等合金相。

2. 效果：与单金属Pt催化剂相比，Pt-Zn催化剂在异丁烷脱氢反应中表现出更好的性能。它们具有更高的活性和100%的异丁烯选择性。

3. 工业应用：这些催化剂用于异丁烷脱氢生产异丁烯。

4. 最新发展：研究表明，在铂催化剂中添加锌可以增强其在脱氢反应中的催化行为。

5. 潜在优势：在脱氢反应中，Pt-Zn催化剂与单金属Pt催化剂相比具有更高的选择性和活性。

文献没有提供足够的信息来比较这些铂基催化剂与金属氧化物基催化剂在轻烯烃脱氢反应中的性能。
