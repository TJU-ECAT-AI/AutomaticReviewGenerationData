[1] "The PtZn system resembles in some aspects the PtSn system. Platinum and zinc can also form alloy phases of different stoichiometries (PtZn, Pt3Zn, among others), which may show distinctive catalytic behaviour as compared to monometallic platinum."

[2] "For example, it has been reported that Pt/ZnO catalysts can achieve 99% selectivity at 45% conversion in the dehydrogenation of iso-butane to iso-butene at 723 K [23]."

[3] "The bimetallic catalyst, with a bulk Zn/Pt atomic ratio of 13.7, showed a much higher initial activity in crotonaldehyde hydrogenation, although it deactivated more strongly with time on stream."

[4] "On the other hand, the catalytic behaviour for iso-butane dehydrogenation was greatly improved by the presence of zinc, the bimetallic catalyst being more active than its monometallic counterpart and showing 100% selectivity to iso-butene."

The literature primarily focuses on platinum-based catalysts, particularly Pt-Zn systems, rather than providing a comprehensive comparison with metal oxide-based catalysts. However, some insights can be drawn:

Compositions: The noble metal-based catalysts discussed are primarily platinum-based, with zinc as a promoter or alloying element. The Pt-Zn system can form different alloy phases like PtZn and Pt3Zn.

Effectiveness: Pt-Zn catalysts show improved performance compared to monometallic Pt catalysts in dehydrogenation reactions. For iso-butane dehydrogenation, a Pt/ZnO catalyst achieved 99% selectivity at 45% conversion at 723 K. The bimetallic Pt-Zn catalyst showed higher activity and 100% selectivity to iso-butene compared to the monometallic Pt catalyst.

Industrial applications: The catalysts are used in dehydrogenation reactions, particularly for light alkanes like iso-butane. They are also applied in selective hydrogenation reactions, such as the hydrogenation of crotonaldehyde.

Recent developments: The research shows interest in understanding the interaction between Pt and Zn, formation of alloy phases, and their impact on catalytic performance. The use of carbonaceous materials as catalyst supports is also noted as an increasing trend.

Potential advantages: Pt-Zn catalysts offer higher selectivity and activity in dehydrogenation reactions compared to monometallic Pt catalysts. The formation of alloy phases and the interaction between Pt and Zn contribute to their improved performance.

The literature does not provide direct comparisons with metal oxide-based catalysts like CrOx, gallium, indium, vanadium, or molybdenum oxides in the context of light olefin dehydrogenation.

该文献主要关注以铂为基础的催化剂，特别是Pt-Zn系统，而没有提供与金属氧化物基催化剂的全面比较。然而，可以得出一些见解：

成分：讨论的贵金属基催化剂主要是以铂为基础的，以锌作为促进剂或合金元素。Pt-Zn系统可以形成不同的合金相，如PtZn和Pt3Zn。

效果：在脱氢反应中，Pt-Zn催化剂表现出比单金属Pt催化剂更好的性能。对于异丁烷脱氢，Pt/ZnO催化剂在723 K下实现了45%转化率时99%的选择性。双金属Pt-Zn催化剂与单金属Pt催化剂相比，显示出更高的活性和100%的异丁烯选择性。

工业应用：这些催化剂用于脱氢反应，特别是轻烷烃如异丁烷的脱氢。它们也应用于选择性加氢反应，如巴豆醛的加氢。

最新发展：研究显示出对理解Pt和Zn之间的相互作用、合金相的形成及其对催化性能的影响的兴趣。使用碳质材料作为催化剂载体也被注意到是一个增长的趋势。

潜在优势：与单金属Pt催化剂相比，Pt-Zn催化剂在脱氢反应中提供更高的选择性和活性。合金相的形成和Pt与Zn之间的相互作用有助于提高其性能。

2. Effectiveness: Pt/ZnO catalysts show high selectivity (99%) and good conversion (45%) in the dehydrogenation of iso-butane to iso-butene at 723 K. The presence of zinc greatly improves the catalytic behavior compared to monometallic platinum catalysts.

3. Industrial applications: The catalysts are used for iso-butane dehydrogenation to produce iso-butene.

4. Recent developments: The study shows that bimetallic Pt-Zn catalysts supported on activated carbon demonstrate improved performance in iso-butane dehydrogenation compared to monometallic Pt catalysts.

5. Potential advantages: Pt-Zn catalysts show higher activity and 100% selectivity to iso-butene in dehydrogenation reactions compared to monometallic Pt catalysts.
