The given literature does not contain information to directly compare and contrast noble metal-based catalysts (particularly Platinum) with metal oxide-based catalysts for the nonoxidative dehydrogenation of light olefins. The document focuses specifically on platinum-tin catalysts supported on silica for propane dehydrogenation. It does not discuss metal oxide catalysts like chromium, gallium, indium, vanadium, zinc, or molybdenum oxides.

However, based on the information provided about platinum-tin catalysts, we can infer some points about noble metal catalysts:

1. Composition: The study examines platinum-tin bimetallic catalysts supported on silica, with 3 wt% Pt and a 1:1 Pt:Sn molar ratio.

2. Effectiveness: The platinum-tin catalysts, particularly PtSn/SiO2 (DR), showed high activity and selectivity (>99%) for propane dehydrogenation to propylene.

3. Recent developments: The study investigates different reduction methods (direct reduction, decomposition in inert gas, and calcination-reduction) to control the interactions between platinum and tin, affecting catalyst performance.

4. Potential advantages: The addition of tin to platinum improved catalytic performance, including activity, selectivity, and stability compared to monometallic platinum catalysts.

The document does not provide information to compare these aspects with metal oxide-based catalysts or discuss their industrial applications in light olefin dehydrogenation.

给定的文献并不包含直接比较和对比贵金属基催化剂（特别是铂）与金属氧化物基催化剂在轻质烯烃非氧化脱氢中的信息。该文档特别关注在二氧化硅上负载的铂-锡催化剂用于丙烷脱氢。它没有讨论诸如铬、镓、铟、钒、锌或钼氧化物等金属氧化物催化剂。

然而，根据提供的关于铂-锡催化剂的信息，我们可以推断出一些关于贵金属催化剂的要点：

1. 成分：该研究考察了在二氧化硅上负载的铂-锡双金属催化剂，铂含量为3 wt%，Pt:Sn摩尔比为1:1。

2. 有效性：铂-锡催化剂，特别是PtSn/SiO2 (DR)，在丙烷脱氢生成丙烯的反应中表现出高活性和选择性（>99%）。

3. 最新发展：该研究调查了不同的还原方法（直接还原、惰性气体分解和煅烧-还原）以控制铂和锡之间的相互作用，从而影响催化剂性能。

4. 潜在优势：与单金属铂催化剂相比，向铂中添加锡改善了催化性能，包括活性、选择性和稳定性。

该文档没有提供与金属氧化物基催化剂比较这些方面的信息，也没有讨论它们在轻质烯烃脱氢中的工业应用。

The given literature does not contain information to directly compare noble metal-based catalysts and metal oxide-based catalysts for light olefin dehydrogenation. The document focuses specifically on platinum-tin catalysts for propane dehydrogenation, without mentioning other metal oxide catalysts. 

To properly answer this question, we would need additional information on metal oxide catalysts like CrOx, gallium, indium, vanadium, zinc and molybdenum oxides used in light olefin dehydrogenation. The literature does not provide details on their compositions, effectiveness, industrial applications or recent developments to enable a comparison with platinum-based catalysts.

From the limited information in the text about platinum catalysts, we can say that:

1. Platinum-tin catalysts supported on silica were studied for propane dehydrogenation.

2. Addition of tin to platinum improved catalytic performance, increasing activity, selectivity to propylene, and stability compared to platinum alone.

3. Different reduction methods (direct reduction, decomposition in inert gas, calcination-reduction) were used to prepare Pt-Sn catalysts with different structures and interactions between platinum and tin.

4. The Pt3Sn alloy phase formed by direct reduction showed the highest activity for propane dehydrogenation.

However, without comparative data on metal oxide catalysts, a full analysis addressing the question's requirements cannot be provided based solely on this literature.

给定的文献并未包含直接比较贵金属基催化剂和金属氧化物基催化剂用于轻质烯烃脱氢的信息。该文档特别关注于用于丙烷脱氢的铂-锡催化剂，没有提及其他金属氧化物催化剂。

要正确回答这个问题，我们需要有关用于轻质烯烃脱氢的CrOx、镓、铟、钒、锌和钼氧化物等金属氧化物催化剂的额外信息。文献没有提供它们的成分、有效性、工业应用或最新发展的详细信息，以便与铂基催化剂进行比较。

从文本中关于铂催化剂的有限信息，我们可以说：

1. 研究了负载在二氧化硅上的铂-锡催化剂用于丙烷脱氢。

2. 向铂中添加锡改善了催化性能，与单独使用铂相比，提高了活性、对丙烯的选择性和稳定性。

3. 使用不同的还原方法（直接还原、惰性气体分解、焙烧-还原）制备了具有不同结构和铂-锡相互作用的Pt-Sn催化剂。

4. 通过直接还原形成的Pt3Sn合金相显示出最高的丙烷脱氢活性。

然而，由于缺乏金属氧化物催化剂的比较数据，仅基于这篇文献无法提供全面解答问题要求的分析。
