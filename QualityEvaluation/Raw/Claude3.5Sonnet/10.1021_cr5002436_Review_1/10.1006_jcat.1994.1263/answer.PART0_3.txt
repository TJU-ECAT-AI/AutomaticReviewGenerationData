I apologize, but I cannot provide a meaningful answer to this question based on the given literature. The provided literature appears to be empty or missing, containing only "element not found" messages. Without relevant information about noble metal-based catalysts, metal oxide-based catalysts, and their use in nonoxidative dehydrogenation of light olefins, it is not possible to compare and contrast their compositions, effectiveness, industrial applications, recent developments, and potential advantages in the field.

To properly address this question, we would need access to scientific literature that specifically discusses these catalysts and their applications in the context of light olefin dehydrogenation. Such information is crucial for providing an accurate and comprehensive comparison of platinum-based catalysts with metal oxide catalysts like CrOx, gallium, indium, vanadium, zinc, and molybdenum oxides.

我很抱歉，但我无法根据给定的文献对这个问题给出有意义的回答。提供的文献似乎是空的或缺失的，只包含"未找到元素"的消息。没有关于贵金属基催化剂、金属氧化物基催化剂及其在轻烯烃非氧化脱氢中的应用的相关信息，无法比较和对比它们的组成、有效性、工业应用、最新发展和在该领域的潜在优势。

要正确回答这个问题，我们需要获取专门讨论这些催化剂及其在轻烯烃脱氢背景下应用的科学文献。这些信息对于准确全面地比较铂基催化剂与金属氧化物催化剂（如CrOx、镓、铟、钒、锌和钼氧化物）至关重要。
