This document does not contain any information about vanadium oxide-based catalysts or their use as alternatives to Pt and CrOx for paraffin dehydrogenation. The text focuses on the catalytic properties of gallium oxide (Ga2O3) for dehydrogenation and dehydrocyclization reactions, particularly involving propane, hexene, hexadiene, and cyclohexane. It does not mention vanadium oxide catalysts or discuss their development since the 1980s. Additionally, there is no information about variables such as carrier type, support surface area, or metal loading influencing vanadium species in catalysts. The question cannot be answered based on the given literature.
