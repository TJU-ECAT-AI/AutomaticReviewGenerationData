This document does not contain any information about vanadium oxide-based catalysts or their exploration as alternatives to Pt and CrOx for paraffin dehydrogenation. The literature focuses on gallium oxide (Ga2O3) and its catalytic properties for dehydrogenation and dehydrocyclization reactions. It does not discuss vanadium oxide catalysts or their development since the 1980s. There is also no mention of variables such as carrier type, support surface area, or metal loading influencing vanadium species in catalysts. The question cannot be answered based on the information provided in this document.
