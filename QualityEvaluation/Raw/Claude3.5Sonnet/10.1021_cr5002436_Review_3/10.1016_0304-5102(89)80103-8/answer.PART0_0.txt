<EnglishVersionAnswer>

The given literature does not contain any information about vanadium oxide-based catalysts for paraffin dehydrogenation. The text focuses on gallium oxide (Ga2O3) as a catalyst for dehydrogenation and dehydrocyclization reactions, particularly of propane and hexene. It does not discuss vanadium oxide catalysts or their development since the 1980s. The document also does not mention variables such as carrier type, support surface area, or metal loading in relation to vanadium species. Therefore, this question cannot be answered based on the provided literature.

给定的文献中不包含任何关于钒氧化物基催化剂用于烷烃脱氢的信息。该文本主要关注氧化镓(Ga2O3)作为脱氢和脱氢环化反应的催化剂,特别是对丙烷和己烯的反应。它没有讨论钒氧化物催化剂或自20世纪80年代以来它们的发展。该文档也没有提到载体类型、支撑物表面积或金属负载等变量与钒物种的关系。因此,根据提供的文献无法回答这个问题。
