[1] "The dehydrogenation of light alkanes to the corresponding alkenes is commercially carried out with supported chromium oxide catalysts (1, 2) and platinum metal catalysts (3, 4). Other, noncommercial alkane dehydrogenation catalysts are based on Mo (510), V (1115), Pd (16), Zn (17, 18), Ni (19), and Ga (20)."

[2] "Supported vanadium oxide catalysts have mainly been studied, however, for the oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes resulting in the formation of alkenes and water (2124)."

[3] "In earlier work (11), we showed that supported vanadium oxide catalyst is also active in the dehydrogenation of alkanes in the absence of oxygen, and the main products are then alkenes and hydrogen."

The exploration of vanadium oxide-based catalysts as alternatives to Pt and CrOx for paraffin dehydrogenation has been driven by the search for new, non-commercial catalysts for alkane dehydrogenation. Research in this area has evolved since the 1980s from focusing mainly on oxidative dehydrogenation to studying non-oxidative dehydrogenation as well. 

The literature does not provide specific information about how variables such as carrier type, support surface area, and metal loading influence the nature and behavior of vanadium species in these catalysts. However, the study does investigate the effects of Mg and Zr modification on alumina-supported vanadium oxide catalysts, which suggests that the type of support and additives can influence catalyst behavior.

作为铂和氧化铬催化剂在烷烃脱氢反应中的替代品，钒氧化物基催化剂的研究主要是由寻找新的非商业化烷烃脱氢催化剂的需求所驱动的。自20世纪80年代以来，该领域的研究已经从主要关注氧化脱氢发展到同时研究非氧化脱氢。

文献中没有提供关于载体类型、载体表面积和金属负载量如何影响这些催化剂中钒物种的性质和行为的具体信息。然而，该研究确实考察了镁和锆改性对氧化铝负载的钒氧化物催化剂的影响，这表明载体类型和添加剂可以影响催化剂的行为。
