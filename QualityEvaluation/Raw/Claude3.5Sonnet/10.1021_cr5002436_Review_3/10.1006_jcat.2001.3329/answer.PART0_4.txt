[1] "The dehydrogenation of light alkanes to the corresponding alkenes is commercially carried out with supported chromium oxide catalysts (1, 2) and platinum metal catalysts (3, 4). Other, noncommercial alkane dehydrogenation catalysts are based on Mo (510), V (1115), Pd (16), Zn (17, 18), Ni (19), and Ga (20)."

[2] "Supported vanadium oxide catalysts have mainly been studied, however, for the oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes resulting in the formation of alkenes and water (2124)."

[3] "In earlier work (11), we showed that supported vanadium oxide catalyst is also active in the dehydrogenation of alkanes in the absence of oxygen, and the main products are then alkenes and hydrogen."

[4] "The goal of this work was to study the influence of promotors Mg and Zr on the catalytic performance of supported vanadium oxide."

The exploration of vanadium oxide-based catalysts as alternatives to Pt and CrOx for paraffin dehydrogenation has been driven by several factors:

1. The search for non-commercial alternatives to chromium oxide and platinum catalysts, which are currently used commercially.

2. The potential for vanadium oxide catalysts to perform dehydrogenation in the absence of oxygen, producing alkenes and hydrogen as main products.

3. The ability to modify and improve vanadium oxide catalysts through the use of promoters like Mg and Zr.

Research in this area has evolved since the 1980s from focusing mainly on oxidative dehydrogenation to exploring non-oxidative dehydrogenation processes. The influence of variables such as carrier type, support surface area, and metal loading on the nature and behavior of vanadium species in these catalysts is not directly addressed in the given literature. However, the study does investigate the effects of Mg and Zr promoters on the catalytic performance, which suggests that these variables are important considerations in catalyst design and optimization.

探索钒氧化物基催化剂作为烷烃脱氢反应中铂和氧化铬催化剂的替代品，主要受以下因素驱动：

1. 寻找非商业化的替代品来取代目前商业使用的氧化铬和铂催化剂。

2. 钒氧化物催化剂在无氧条件下进行脱氢反应的潜力，主要产物为烯烃和氢气。

3. 通过使用如镁和锆等助剂来修饰和改进钒氧化物催化剂的可能性。

自20世纪80年代以来，该领域的研究已从主要关注氧化脱氢发展到探索非氧化脱氢过程。给定的文献中没有直接讨论载体类型、载体表面积和金属负载量等变量对这些催化剂中钒物种的性质和行为的影响。然而，该研究确实考察了镁和锆助剂对催化性能的影响，这表明这些变量在催化剂设计和优化中是重要的考虑因素。
