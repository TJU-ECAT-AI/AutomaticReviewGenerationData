[1] "The dehydrogenation of light alkanes to the corresponding alkenes is commercially carried out with supported chromium oxide catalysts (1, 2) and platinum metal catalysts (3, 4). Other, noncommercial alkane dehydrogenation catalysts are based on Mo (510), V (1115), Pd (16), Zn (17, 18), Ni (19), and Ga (20)."

[2] "Supported vanadium oxide catalysts have mainly been studied, however, for the oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes resulting in the formation of alkenes and water (2124)."

[3] "In earlier work (11), we showed that supported vanadium oxide catalyst is also active in the dehydrogenation of alkanes in the absence of oxygen, and the main products are then alkenes and hydrogen."

[4] "The goal of this work was to study the influence of promotors Mg and Zr on the catalytic performance of supported vanadium oxide."

The exploration of vanadium oxide-based catalysts as alternatives to Pt and CrOx for paraffin dehydrogenation has been driven by the search for non-commercial alkane dehydrogenation catalysts. Research in this area has evolved since the 1980s from focusing mainly on oxidative dehydrogenation to studying dehydrogenation in the absence of oxygen. 

Variables such as carrier type, support surface area, and metal loading influence the nature and behavior of vanadium species in these catalysts. This study specifically examined the influence of Mg and Zr promoters on the catalytic performance of supported vanadium oxide. However, the literature provided does not give detailed information on how these variables affect the vanadium species.

The research has progressed from studying vanadium oxide catalysts mainly for oxidative dehydrogenation to exploring their potential in non-oxidative dehydrogenation, demonstrating their ability to produce alkenes and hydrogen in the absence of oxygen.

作为铂和氧化铬催化剂的替代品，钒氧化物基催化剂的研究主要是由寻找非商业化烷烃脱氢催化剂的需求所驱动的。自20世纪80年代以来，该领域的研究已从主要关注氧化脱氢发展到研究无氧条件下的脱氢反应。

载体类型、支撑体表面积和金属负载量等变量影响着这些催化剂中钒物种的性质和行为。本研究特别考察了镁和锆促进剂对负载型钒氧化物催化性能的影响。然而，所提供的文献并未详细说明这些变量如何影响钒物种。

研究已经从主要研究钒氧化物催化剂的氧化脱氢性能，发展到探索它们在非氧化脱氢中的潜力，证明了它们在无氧条件下能够生产烯烃和氢气。
