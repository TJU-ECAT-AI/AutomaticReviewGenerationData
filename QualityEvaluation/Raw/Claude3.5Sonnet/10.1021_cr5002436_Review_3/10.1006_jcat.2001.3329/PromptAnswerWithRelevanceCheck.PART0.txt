[1] "The dehydrogenation of light alkanes to the corresponding alkenes is commercially carried out with supported chromium oxide catalysts (1, 2) and platinum metal catalysts (3, 4). Other, noncommercial alkane dehydrogenation catalysts are based on Mo (510), V (1115), Pd (16), Zn (17, 18), Ni (19), and Ga (20)."

[2] "Supported vanadium oxide catalysts have mainly been studied, however, for the oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes resulting in the formation of alkenes and water (2124)."

[3] "In earlier work (11), we showed that supported vanadium oxide catalyst is also active in the dehydrogenation of alkanes in the absence of oxygen, and the main products are then alkenes and hydrogen."

[4] "The goal of this work was to study the influence of promotors Mg and Zr on the catalytic performance of supported vanadium oxide."

[5] "Apparently both V4+ and V3+ species were active in the dehydrogenation, and tentatively, we conclude that the activity of V4+ (A) was higher than that of V3+."

Vanadium oxide-based catalysts have been explored as alternatives to Pt and CrOx for paraffin dehydrogenation due to several factors:

1. The commercial use of chromium oxide and platinum catalysts for light alkane dehydrogenation has driven research into alternative catalysts.

2. Vanadium oxide catalysts have shown activity in both oxidative dehydrogenation and non-oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes.

3. The ability to produce alkenes and hydrogen as main products in the absence of oxygen makes vanadium oxide catalysts attractive for study.

Research in this area has evolved since the 1980s by:

1. Expanding from oxidative dehydrogenation studies to non-oxidative dehydrogenation.

2. Investigating the influence of promoters like Mg and Zr on catalytic performance.

3. Studying the active species and oxidation states of vanadium in the catalysts.

Variables influencing the nature and behavior of vanadium species in these catalysts include:

1. The type of support used (e.g., alumina in this study).

2. The addition of promoters like Mg and Zr.

3. The reduction method (H2 or CO) and temperature, which affect the oxidation states of vanadium.

4. The presence of V4+ and V3+ species, with V4+ (A) potentially showing higher activity.

However, the literature does not provide specific information on how carrier type, support surface area, and metal loading influence the vanadium species. More research would be needed to fully address these aspects.

钒氧化物基催化剂作为烷烃脱氢反应中铂和铬氧化物催化剂的替代品被探索，主要由以下因素驱动：

1. 铬氧化物和铂催化剂在轻烷烃脱氢中的商业应用推动了对替代催化剂的研究。

2. 钒氧化物催化剂在烷烃的氧化脱氢和非氧化脱氢反应中都表现出活性。

3. 在无氧条件下能够产生烯烃和氢气作为主要产物，使钒氧化物催化剂成为具有吸引力的研究对象。

自20世纪80年代以来，该领域的研究已经发展：

1. 从氧化脱氢研究扩展到非氧化脱氢研究。

2. 研究镁和锆等助剂对催化性能的影响。

3. 研究催化剂中钒的活性物种和氧化态。

影响这些催化剂中钒物种性质和行为的变量包括：

1. 所使用的载体类型（例如，本研究中的氧化铝）。

2. 添加镁和锆等助剂。

3. 还原方法（氢气或一氧化碳）和温度，这些因素影响钒的氧化态。

4. V4+和V3+物种的存在，其中V4+（A）可能表现出更高的活性。

然而，文献中并未提供载体类型、载体表面积和金属负载量如何影响钒物种的具体信息。需要进行更多研究才能全面解答这些方面的问题。

The exploration of vanadium oxide-based catalysts as alternatives to Pt and CrOx for paraffin dehydrogenation has been driven by the search for new, non-commercial catalysts for alkane dehydrogenation. Research in this area has evolved since the 1980s from focusing mainly on oxidative dehydrogenation to studying non-oxidative dehydrogenation as well. 

The literature does not provide specific information about how variables such as carrier type, support surface area, and metal loading influence the nature and behavior of vanadium species in these catalysts. However, the study does investigate the effects of Mg and Zr modification on alumina-supported vanadium oxide catalysts, which suggests that the type of support and additives can influence catalyst behavior.
