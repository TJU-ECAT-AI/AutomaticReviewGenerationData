[1] "The dehydrogenation of light alkanes to the corresponding alkenes is commercially carried out with supported chromium oxide catalysts (1, 2) and platinum metal catalysts (3, 4). Other, noncommercial alkane dehydrogenation catalysts are based on Mo (510), V (1115), Pd (16), Zn (17, 18), Ni (19), and Ga (20)."

[2] "Supported vanadium oxide catalysts have mainly been studied, however, for the oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes resulting in the formation of alkenes and water (2124)."

[3] "In earlier work (11), we showed that supported vanadium oxide catalyst is also active in the dehydrogenation of alkanes in the absence of oxygen, and the main products are then alkenes and hydrogen."

The exploration of vanadium oxide-based catalysts for paraffin dehydrogenation has been driven by the search for alternatives to commercial chromium oxide and platinum catalysts. Research in this area has evolved since the 1980s from focusing mainly on oxidative dehydrogenation to studying non-oxidative dehydrogenation as well. 

The document does not provide specific information on how variables such as carrier type, support surface area, and metal loading influence the nature and behavior of vanadium species in these catalysts. However, it does mention that the study focused on alumina-supported vanadium oxide catalysts, and that modifications with Mg and Zr were explored to investigate their effects on catalyst performance.

钒氧化物基催化剂在烷烃脱氢领域的探索主要是为了寻找商业用铬氧化物和铂催化剂的替代品。自20世纪80年代以来，该领域的研究从主要关注氧化脱氢发展到同时研究非氧化脱氢。

文献中没有提供关于载体类型、载体表面积和金属负载量如何影响这些催化剂中钒物种的性质和行为的具体信息。然而，文献确实提到研究集中在氧化铝负载的钒氧化物催化剂上，并探索了用镁和锆进行改性以研究它们对催化剂性能的影响。
