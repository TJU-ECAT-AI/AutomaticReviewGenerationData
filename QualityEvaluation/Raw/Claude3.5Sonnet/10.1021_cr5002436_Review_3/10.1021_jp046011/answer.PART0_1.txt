The given literature does not contain information specifically addressing the factors driving exploration of vanadium oxide catalysts as alternatives to Pt and CrOx for paraffin dehydrogenation, how this research has evolved since the 1980s, or how variables like carrier type, support surface area, and metal loading influence vanadium species in these catalysts. The text focuses on characterization of vanadium oxide species supported on alumina using various spectroscopic techniques, but does not discuss the broader context of vanadium catalysts for dehydrogenation reactions or their development over time.

所给文献并未包含具体讨论推动钒氧化物催化剂作为Pt和CrOx替代品用于烷烃脱氢的因素、自1980年代以来该研究领域如何发展、以及载体类型、载体表面积和金属负载量等变量如何影响这些催化剂中钒物种性质和行为的信息。文本主要集中于使用各种光谱技术表征氧化铝负载的钒氧化物物种,但未讨论钒催化剂在脱氢反应中的更广泛背景或其随时间的发展。
