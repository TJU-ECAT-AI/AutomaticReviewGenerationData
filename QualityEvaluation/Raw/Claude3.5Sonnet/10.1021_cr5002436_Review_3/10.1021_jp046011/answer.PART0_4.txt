The given literature does not contain information directly relevant to answering the question about factors driving exploration of vanadium oxide catalysts as alternatives to Pt and CrOx for paraffin dehydrogenation, the evolution of research in this area since the 1980s, or how variables like carrier type, support surface area, and metal loading influence vanadium species in these catalysts. The document focuses on characterization of vanadium oxide supported on alumina using various spectroscopic techniques, but does not discuss its use specifically for paraffin dehydrogenation or compare it to Pt/CrOx catalysts. Without additional relevant information, this question cannot be adequately answered based solely on the provided literature.

给定的文献并不包含直接回答关于驱动钒氧化物催化剂作为Pt和CrOx替代品用于烷烃脱氢的因素、自1980年代以来该领域研究的演变、或者载体类型、支撑体表面积和金属负载量等变量如何影响这些催化剂中钒物种的问题的相关信息。该文档主要关注使用各种光谱技术对氧化铝负载的钒氧化物进行表征，但并未特别讨论其在烷烃脱氢中的应用或将其与Pt/CrOx催化剂进行比较。由于缺乏额外的相关信息，仅基于所提供的文献无法充分回答这个问题。
