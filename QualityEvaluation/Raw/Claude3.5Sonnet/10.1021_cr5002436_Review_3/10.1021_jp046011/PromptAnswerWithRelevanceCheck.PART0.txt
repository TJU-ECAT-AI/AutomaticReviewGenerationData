<EnglishVersionAnswer>

The provided literature does not contain information specifically addressing the factors driving exploration of vanadium oxide catalysts as alternatives to Pt and CrOx for paraffin dehydrogenation, the evolution of research in this area since the 1980s, or how variables like carrier type, support surface area, and metal loading influence vanadium species in these catalysts. The document focuses on characterizing vanadium oxide species supported on alumina using various spectroscopic techniques, but does not discuss the broader context of vanadium catalysts for dehydrogenation reactions or their development over time.

<EnglishVersionAnswer>

The given scientific literature does not contain information directly relevant to answering the question about factors driving the exploration of vanadium oxide-based catalysts as alternatives to Pt and CrOx for paraffin dehydrogenation, how research in this area has evolved since the 1980s, or how variables such as carrier type, support surface area, and metal loading influence vanadium species in these catalysts.

The document focuses on characterizing vanadium oxide species supported on different types of alumina using various spectroscopic techniques. It does not discuss the historical development of vanadium catalysts as alternatives to platinum or chromium oxide catalysts for paraffin dehydrogenation. Additionally, while the study examines the effects of metal loading, it does not compare different carrier types or discuss how support surface area impacts the vanadium species.

To properly address the question, additional literature sources focusing specifically on the development and comparative advantages of vanadium oxide catalysts for paraffin dehydrogenation would be needed.

给定的科学文献并不包含直接回答关于驱动钒氧化物基催化剂作为Pt和CrOx替代品用于烷烃脱氢的因素,该领域的研究自1980年代以来如何发展,或者载体类型、载体表面积和金属负载量等变量如何影响这些催化剂中钒物种的问题的相关信息。

该文档主要集中于使用各种光谱技术表征负载在不同类型氧化铝上的钒氧化物物种。它没有讨论钒催化剂作为铂或氧化铬催化剂在烷烃脱氢中的替代品的历史发展。此外,虽然该研究考察了金属负载量的影响,但没有比较不同的载体类型或讨论载体表面积如何影响钒物种。

要正确回答这个问题,需要额外的文献资料,特别是关注钒氧化物催化剂在烷烃脱氢中的发展和比较优势的文献。
