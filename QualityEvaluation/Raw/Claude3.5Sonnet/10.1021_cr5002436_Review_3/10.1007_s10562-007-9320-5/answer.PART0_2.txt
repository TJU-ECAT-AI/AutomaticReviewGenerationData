The given literature does not contain information directly relevant to answering this question about the evolution of research on vanadium oxide-based catalysts for paraffin dehydrogenation since the 1980s. The text focuses specifically on deactivation of VMgO catalysts by coke formation during isobutane dehydrogenation, rather than providing a broad overview of research trends for vanadium oxide catalysts. It does not discuss factors driving exploration of these catalysts as alternatives to Pt and CrOx, nor does it cover how variables like carrier type and support surface area influence vanadium species behavior. The document lacks the historical perspective and broader context needed to properly address this question.

给定的文献没有包含直接相关的信息来回答这个关于钒氧化物基催化剂在烷烃脱氢方面的研究自1980年代以来的演变问题。这篇文章主要集中讨论了VMgO催化剂在异丁烷脱氢过程中由于结焦而导致的失活,而不是提供钒氧化物催化剂研究趋势的广泛概述。它没有讨论推动这些催化剂作为Pt和CrOx替代品的因素,也没有涉及载体类型和支撑体表面积等变量如何影响钒物种行为。该文档缺乏适当回答这个问题所需的历史视角和更广泛的背景。
