The given literature does not contain information directly relevant to answering the question about vanadium oxide-based catalysts as alternatives to Pt and CrOx for paraffin dehydrogenation. The text focuses on deactivation of VMgOx catalysts by coke formation during isobutane dehydrogenation, but does not discuss the broader context of vanadium catalysts as alternatives to platinum or chromium oxide, the historical evolution of this research area, or how variables like carrier type and surface area influence vanadium species behavior. The document does not provide sufficient information to address the specific points raised in the question.
