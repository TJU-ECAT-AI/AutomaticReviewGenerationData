The given literature does not contain information directly relevant to answering this question about the evolution of research on vanadium oxide-based catalysts for paraffin dehydrogenation since the 1980s. The text focuses on deactivation of VMgO catalysts by coke formation during isobutane dehydrogenation, but does not discuss the broader research trends, comparisons to Pt and CrOx catalysts, or effects of variables like carrier type and support surface area. To properly answer this question would require additional sources covering the historical development of vanadium catalysts for dehydrogenation reactions.

所给文献中没有直接相关的信息来回答这个关于1980年代以来钒氧化物基催化剂用于烷烃脱氢研究演变的问题。该文本主要关注VMgO催化剂在异丁烷脱氢过程中由于积碳而失活,但没有讨论更广泛的研究趋势、与Pt和CrOx催化剂的比较,或者载体类型和比表面积等变量的影响。要正确回答这个问题需要额外的资料来涵盖钒催化剂在脱氢反应中的历史发展。
