<EnglishVersionAnswer>

The literature does not provide specific information about the evolution of research on vanadium oxide-based catalysts since the 1980s or how variables like carrier type, support surface area, and metal loading influence these catalysts. The document only briefly mentions that environmental concerns have driven exploration of alternative catalysts not containing chromium, such as gallium oxide-based catalysts, for propane dehydrogenation. There is insufficient information to fully answer the question about vanadium oxide catalysts specifically.

该文献没有提供关于钒氧化物催化剂自1980年代以来研究演变的具体信息，也没有说明载体类型、载体表面积和金属负载量等变量如何影响这些催化剂。文档仅简要提到，出于环境考虑，研究人员开始探索不含铬的替代催化剂，如氧化镓基催化剂，用于丙烷脱氢。关于钒氧化物催化剂的问题，没有足够的信息来全面回答。

[1] "From environmental points of view, the authors have focused attention on gallium oxide-based catalysts for developing high performance catalysts not containing chromium for the dehydrogenation of propane."

[2] "In the present study, the dehydrogenation of propane over a silica-supported vanadium oxide catalyst was investigated."

[3] "The content of vanadium oxide in the catalyst was 5 wt%. The molar content of vanadium oxide in the catalyst was 1.7 mol%. The surface area of the catalyst was 350 m2/g."

</quotes>

<EnglishVersionAnswer>

The literature does not provide a comprehensive history of vanadium oxide catalyst research since the 1980s or extensively discuss factors driving their exploration as alternatives to Pt and CrOx catalysts. However, it does mention that environmental concerns have motivated research into non-chromium catalysts for propane dehydrogenation, which led to the authors' focus on gallium oxide and vanadium oxide catalysts.

The study investigates a silica-supported vanadium oxide catalyst, providing some information on how support type and metal loading influence the catalyst. Specifically, the catalyst used a silica support with a high surface area of 350 m2/g, and contained 5 wt% (1.7 mol%) vanadium oxide. These parameters likely affect the dispersion and behavior of vanadium species on the support.

The literature does not provide enough information to fully address how research in this area has evolved over time or comprehensively discuss the influence of different variables on vanadium species behavior. More detailed historical context and comparative studies would be needed to fully answer those aspects of the question.

该文献并未提供自1980年代以来钒氧化物催化剂研究的全面历史，也没有广泛讨论推动其作为Pt和CrOx催化剂替代品的因素。然而，它确实提到环境问题促使研究人员开发不含铬的丙烷脱氢催化剂，这导致作者关注氧化镓和氧化钒催化剂。

该研究考察了一种硅胶负载的钒氧化物催化剂，提供了一些关于载体类型和金属负载如何影响催化剂的信息。具体来说，所用催化剂使用了表面积高达350 m2/g的硅胶载体，含有5 wt%（1.7 mol%）的钒氧化物。这些参数可能影响钒物种在载体上的分散和行为。

该文献没有提供足够的信息来全面阐述该领域研究如何随时间演变，或全面讨论不同变量对钒物种行为的影响。要充分回答这些问题的各个方面，需要更详细的历史背景和比较研究。

The literature does not provide a comprehensive overview of the evolution of vanadium oxide catalyst research since the 1980s or extensively discuss factors driving exploration of these catalysts as alternatives to Pt and CrOx. However, it does mention that environmental concerns have motivated research into non-chromium catalysts, including gallium oxide-based and vanadium oxide-based catalysts, for propane dehydrogenation.

The study focuses specifically on a silica-supported vanadium oxide catalyst. Some key variables mentioned that influence the catalyst's properties include:

1. Support type: Silica was used as the support material.
2. Support surface area: The catalyst had a surface area of 350 m2/g.
3. Metal loading: The catalyst contained 5 wt% vanadium oxide (1.7 mol%).

While the paper does not extensively discuss how these variables impact the nature and behavior of vanadium species, it does examine how the catalyst performs under different conditions (presence/absence of CO2) and how the oxidation state of vanadium changes during the reaction.

该文献并未提供自1980年代以来钒氧化物催化剂研究演变的全面概述，也没有广泛讨论推动这些催化剂作为铂和铬氧化物替代品探索的因素。然而，它确实提到环境考虑因素促使研究人员开发不含铬的催化剂，包括氧化镓基和钒氧化物基催化剂，用于丙烷脱氢。

该研究主要关注硅胶负载的钒氧化物催化剂。提到的一些影响催化剂性能的关键变量包括：

1. 载体类型：使用硅胶作为载体材料。
2. 载体表面积：催化剂的表面积为350 m2/g。
3. 金属负载量：催化剂含有5 wt%的钒氧化物（1.7 mol%）。

虽然该论文没有广泛讨论这些变量如何影响钒物种的性质和行为，但它确实研究了催化剂在不同条件下（有/无CO2存在）的表现，以及钒的氧化态在反应过程中如何变化。

The literature does not directly address the evolution of research on vanadium oxide-based catalysts since the 1980s or the specific factors driving their exploration as alternatives to Pt and CrOx. However, it does mention that environmental concerns have led to research on non-chromium catalysts like gallium oxide for propane dehydrogenation. The paper focuses on studying a silica-supported vanadium oxide catalyst, but does not provide historical context for this research direction.

The document does not discuss how variables such as carrier type, support surface area, and metal loading influence vanadium species in these catalysts. It only specifies that the catalyst studied used a silica support with 5 wt% vanadium oxide loading and 350 m2/g surface area. More information would be needed to fully answer the question about the influence of these variables on vanadium catalyst behavior.

该文献并未直接讨论自1980年代以来钒氧化物基催化剂研究的演变,也没有具体说明将其作为铂和氧化铬替代品进行探索的驱动因素。但是,文中提到出于环境考虑,研究人员关注了不含铬的高性能催化剂,如用于丙烷脱氢的氧化镓催化剂。该论文主要研究了一种二氧化硅负载的钒氧化物催化剂,但没有提供这一研究方向的历史背景。

文中没有讨论载体类型、支撑体表面积和金属负载量等变量如何影响这些催化剂中的钒物种。它只指出所研究的催化剂使用了二氧化硅载体,钒氧化物负载量为5%,表面积为350 m2/g。要全面回答这些变量如何影响钒催化剂行为的问题,还需要更多信息。
