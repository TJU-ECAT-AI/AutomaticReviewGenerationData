[1] "From environmental points of view, the authors have focused attention on gallium oxide-based catalysts for developing high performance catalysts not containing chromium for the dehydrogenation of propane."

[2] "In the present study, the dehydrogenation of propane over a silica-supported vanadium oxide catalyst was investigated."

The literature does not provide comprehensive information on the historical evolution of vanadium oxide-based catalyst research since the 1980s or detailed comparisons to Pt and CrOx catalysts. The study focuses specifically on silica-supported vanadium oxide catalysts for propane dehydrogenation, mentioning environmental concerns as a driver for developing chromium-free catalysts. The paper does not discuss how variables like carrier type, support surface area, and metal loading influence vanadium species behavior in detail. More information would be needed from other sources to fully answer the question.

这篇文献并未提供自1980年代以来钒氧化物基催化剂研究的历史演变的全面信息,也没有与Pt和CrOx催化剂的详细比较。该研究特别关注用于丙烷脱氢的二氧化硅负载钒氧化物催化剂,提到环境问题是开发无铬催化剂的驱动因素。这篇论文没有详细讨论载体类型、载体表面积和金属负载量等变量如何影响钒物种的行为。需要从其他来源获取更多信息才能全面回答这个问题。
