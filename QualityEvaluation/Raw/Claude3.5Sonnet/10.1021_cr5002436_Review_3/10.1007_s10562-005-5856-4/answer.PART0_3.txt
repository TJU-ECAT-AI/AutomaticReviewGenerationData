The literature does not directly address the evolution of research on vanadium oxide-based catalysts since the 1980s or the specific factors driving their exploration as alternatives to Pt and CrOx. However, it does mention that environmental concerns have led to research on non-chromium catalysts like gallium oxide for propane dehydrogenation. The paper focuses on studying a silica-supported vanadium oxide catalyst, but does not provide historical context for this research direction.

The document does not discuss how variables such as carrier type, support surface area, and metal loading influence vanadium species in these catalysts. It only specifies that the catalyst studied used a silica support with 5 wt% vanadium oxide loading and 350 m2/g surface area. More information would be needed to fully answer the question about the influence of these variables on vanadium catalyst behavior.

该文献并未直接讨论自1980年代以来钒氧化物基催化剂研究的演变,也没有具体说明将其作为铂和氧化铬替代品进行探索的驱动因素。但是,文中提到出于环境考虑,研究人员关注了不含铬的高性能催化剂,如用于丙烷脱氢的氧化镓催化剂。该论文主要研究了一种二氧化硅负载的钒氧化物催化剂,但没有提供这一研究方向的历史背景。

文中没有讨论载体类型、支撑体表面积和金属负载量等变量如何影响这些催化剂中的钒物种。它只指出所研究的催化剂使用了二氧化硅载体,钒氧化物负载量为5%,表面积为350 m2/g。要全面回答这些变量如何影响钒催化剂行为的问题,还需要更多信息。
