[1] "From environmental points of view, the authors have focused attention on gallium oxide-based catalysts for developing high performance catalysts not containing chromium for the dehydrogenation of propane."

<EnglishVersionAnswer>

The literature does not provide specific information about the evolution of research on vanadium oxide-based catalysts since the 1980s or how variables like carrier type, support surface area, and metal loading influence these catalysts. The document only briefly mentions that environmental concerns have driven exploration of alternative catalysts not containing chromium, such as gallium oxide-based catalysts, for propane dehydrogenation. There is insufficient information to fully answer the question about vanadium oxide catalysts specifically.

该文献没有提供关于钒氧化物催化剂自1980年代以来研究演变的具体信息，也没有说明载体类型、载体表面积和金属负载量等变量如何影响这些催化剂。文档仅简要提到，出于环境考虑，研究人员开始探索不含铬的替代催化剂，如氧化镓基催化剂，用于丙烷脱氢。关于钒氧化物催化剂的问题，没有足够的信息来全面回答。
