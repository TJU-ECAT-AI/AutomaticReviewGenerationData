[1] "From environmental points of view, the authors have focused attention on gallium oxide-based catalysts for developing high performance catalysts not containing chromium for the dehydrogenation of propane."

[2] "In the present study, the dehydrogenation of propane over a silica-supported vanadium oxide catalyst was investigated."

[3] "The content of vanadium oxide in the catalyst was 5 wt%. The molar content of vanadium oxide in the catalyst was 1.7 mol%. The surface area of the catalyst was 350 m2/g."

The literature does not provide a comprehensive history of vanadium oxide catalyst research since the 1980s or extensively discuss factors driving their exploration as alternatives to Pt and CrOx catalysts. However, it does mention that environmental concerns have motivated research into non-chromium catalysts for propane dehydrogenation, which led to the authors' focus on gallium oxide and vanadium oxide catalysts.

The study investigates a silica-supported vanadium oxide catalyst, providing some information on how support type and metal loading influence the catalyst. Specifically, the catalyst used a silica support with a high surface area of 350 m2/g, and contained 5 wt% (1.7 mol%) vanadium oxide. These parameters likely affect the dispersion and behavior of vanadium species on the support.

The literature does not provide enough information to fully address how research in this area has evolved over time or comprehensively discuss the influence of different variables on vanadium species behavior. More detailed historical context and comparative studies would be needed to fully answer those aspects of the question.

该文献并未提供自1980年代以来钒氧化物催化剂研究的全面历史，也没有广泛讨论推动其作为Pt和CrOx催化剂替代品的因素。然而，它确实提到环境问题促使研究人员开发不含铬的丙烷脱氢催化剂，这导致作者关注氧化镓和氧化钒催化剂。

该研究考察了一种硅胶负载的钒氧化物催化剂，提供了一些关于载体类型和金属负载如何影响催化剂的信息。具体来说，所用催化剂使用了表面积高达350 m2/g的硅胶载体，含有5 wt%（1.7 mol%）的钒氧化物。这些参数可能影响钒物种在载体上的分散和行为。

该文献没有提供足够的信息来全面阐述该领域研究如何随时间演变，或全面讨论不同变量对钒物种行为的影响。要充分回答这些问题的各个方面，需要更详细的历史背景和比较研究。
