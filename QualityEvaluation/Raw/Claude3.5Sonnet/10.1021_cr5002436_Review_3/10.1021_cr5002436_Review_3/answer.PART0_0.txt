Exploration of vanadium oxide-based catalysts as alternatives to Pt and CrOx for paraffin dehydrogenation has been driven by several factors:

1. Catalyst poisoning issues with Pt and CrOx
2. High cost of platinum
3. Environmental concerns related to chromium use

Research in this area has evolved since the 1980s:

- Initial focus was on oxidative dehydrogenation using vanadium-magnesium mixed oxides
- Later expanded to non-oxidative dehydrogenation with various vanadium oxide formulations

The nature and behavior of vanadium species in these catalysts are influenced by:

1. Type of carrier/support
2. Support surface area
3. Metal loading
4. Oxidation state of vanadium

These variables affect the distribution of vanadium species:

- Isolated vanadium species at low coverage
- Polymeric species or sheets at intermediate coverage
- V2O5 crystallites above monolayer coverage

The interplay of these factors determines the catalytic performance and stability of vanadium oxide-based dehydrogenation catalysts.

作为铂和氧化铬催化剂的替代品，钒氧化物基催化剂的探索受到以下因素的推动：

1. 铂和氧化铬催化剂的中毒问题
2. 铂的高成本
3. 使用铬的环境问题

自20世纪80年代以来，该领域的研究已经发展：

- 最初关注于使用钒-镁混合氧化物进行氧化脱氢
- 后来扩展到各种钒氧化物配方的非氧化脱氢

这些催化剂中钒物种的性质和行为受以下因素影响：

1. 载体/支撑材料的类型
2. 支撑材料的表面积
3. 金属负载量
4. 钒的氧化态

这些变量影响钒物种的分布：

- 低覆盖率时的孤立钒物种
- 中等覆盖率时的聚合物种或片状结构
- 单层以上覆盖率时的V2O5晶体

这些因素的相互作用决定了钒氧化物基脱氢催化剂的催化性能和稳定性。
