Exploration of vanadium oxide-based catalysts as alternatives to Pt and CrOx for paraffin dehydrogenation has been driven by several factors:

1. Catalyst poisoning issues with existing Pt and CrOx catalysts
2. The high cost of platinum
3. Environmental concerns associated with chromium use

Research in this area has evolved since the 1980s. Initially, the focus was on oxidative dehydrogenation using vanadium-magnesium mixed oxides. Over time, the research expanded to include non-oxidative dehydrogenation and a wider range of vanadium oxide-based catalysts.

The nature and behavior of vanadium species in these catalysts are influenced by several variables:

1. Carrier type
2. Support surface area
3. Metal loading
4. Oxidation state of vanadium

These factors determine the form of vanadium present on the catalyst:

- At low coverage: isolated vanadium species
- At intermediate coverage: polymeric species or sheets of vanadium oxide
- Above monolayer coverage: V2O5 crystallites

The interplay of these variables affects the catalyst's performance, stability, and selectivity in paraffin dehydrogenation reactions.

作为铂和氧化铬催化剂替代品的钒氧化物基催化剂的探索受到几个因素的推动：

1. 现有铂和氧化铬催化剂的中毒问题
2. 铂的高成本
3. 使用铬带来的环境问题

自20世纪80年代以来，这一领域的研究不断发展。最初，研究重点是使用钒-镁混合氧化物进行氧化脱氢。随着时间的推移，研究扩展到包括非氧化脱氢和更广泛的钒氧化物基催化剂。

这些催化剂中钒物种的性质和行为受到几个变量的影响：

1. 载体类型
2. 载体表面积
3. 金属负载量
4. 钒的氧化态

这些因素决定了催化剂上存在的钒形式：

- 低覆盖率：孤立的钒物种
- 中等覆盖率：聚合物种或钒氧化物片
- 超过单层覆盖率：V2O5晶体

这些变量的相互作用影响了催化剂在烷烃脱氢反应中的性能、稳定性和选择性。
