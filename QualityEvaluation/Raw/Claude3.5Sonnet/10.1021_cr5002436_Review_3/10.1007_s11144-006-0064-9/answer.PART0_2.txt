[1] "In our previous papers we presented the results of the dehydrogenation of isobutane with carbon dioxide over vanadium magnesium oxides [3, 4]. We discussed the influence of vanadium loading and the preparation method on the catalyst activity and its phase composition."

[2] "This report deals with the dehydrogenation of isobutane to isobutene with carbon dioxide over different vanadium containing catalysts. Effects of the support on the conversion of isobutane and selectivity to isobutene will be discussed in terms of redox and acid-base properties of the catalysts."

[3] "The activity of the supported vanadium oxide catalysts during the dehydrogenation of isobutane in the presence and absence of carbon dioxide decreases in the order Cact >> Al2O3 > SiO2 > ZnO > La2O3 > CeO2 > TiO2 ≈ ZrO2."

[4] "The high activity of the first four catalysts is correlated with the their ability to undergo reduction at lower temperatures. Moreover, the highest isobutane conversions were obtained over the VOx/Cact and VOx/Al2O3, characterized by considerable acidity, which is probably related to the sorption of isobutane on the catalyst surface."

The literature does not provide a comprehensive historical overview of vanadium oxide catalysts as alternatives to Pt and CrOx for paraffin dehydrogenation since the 1980s. However, it does discuss some factors influencing the exploration of vanadium oxide-based catalysts for isobutane dehydrogenation:

1. The study focuses on using carbon dioxide as a reactant in the dehydrogenation process, which is a more recent development in catalyst research.

2. The researchers investigated the effects of different supports on the catalytic performance of vanadium oxide catalysts. They tested various supports including Cact, Al2O3, SiO2, ZnO, La2O3, CeO2, TiO2, and ZrO2.

3. The activity of the catalysts was found to be influenced by the type of support, with the order of activity being Cact >> Al2O3 > SiO2 > ZnO > La2O3 > CeO2 > TiO2 ≈ ZrO2.

4. The redox properties of the catalysts, particularly their ability to undergo reduction at lower temperatures, were correlated with higher activity.

5. The acidity of the catalyst surface was identified as an important factor, with VOx/Cact and VOx/Al2O3 showing the highest isobutane conversions due to their considerable acidity.

6. The researchers examined how the support affected the conversion of isobutane and selectivity to isobutene in terms of redox and acid-base properties of the catalysts.

7. Previous studies by the same authors had explored the influence of vanadium loading and preparation methods on catalyst activity and phase composition.

While the document doesn't explicitly discuss the evolution of research since the 1980s or provide detailed information on the influence of support surface area and metal loading, it does highlight the importance of these variables in determining the nature and behavior of vanadium species in the catalysts.

文献并没有提供自1980年代以来钒氧化物催化剂作为铂和氧化铬在烷烃脱氢中替代品的全面历史概述。然而，它确实讨论了一些影响钒氧化物基催化剂在异丁烷脱氢中应用探索的因素：

1. 该研究重点关注二氧化碳作为脱氢过程中的反应物，这是催化剂研究中较新的发展。

2. 研究人员调查了不同载体对钒氧化物催化剂催化性能的影响。他们测试了各种载体，包括活性炭、Al2O3、SiO2、ZnO、La2O3、CeO2、TiO2和ZrO2。

3. 发现催化剂的活性受载体类型的影响，活性顺序为Cact >> Al2O3 > SiO2 > ZnO > La2O3 > CeO2 > TiO2 ≈ ZrO2。

4. 催化剂的氧化还原性质，特别是在较低温度下发生还原的能力，与更高的活性相关。

5. 催化剂表面的酸性被认为是一个重要因素，VOx/Cact和VOx/Al2O3由于其显著的酸性而表现出最高的异丁烷转化率。

6. 研究人员从催化剂的氧化还原和酸碱性质方面研究了载体如何影响异丁烷的转化率和异丁烯的选择性。

7. 同一作者之前的研究探讨了钒负载量和制备方法对催化剂活性和相组成的影响。

虽然该文档没有明确讨论自1980年代以来研究的演变，也没有提供关于载体表面积和金属负载量影响的详细信息，但它确实强调了这些变量在决定催化剂中钒物种的性质和行为方面的重要性。
