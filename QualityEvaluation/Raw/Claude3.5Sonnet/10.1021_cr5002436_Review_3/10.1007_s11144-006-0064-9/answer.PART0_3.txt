[1] "In our previous papers we presented the results of the dehydrogenation of isobutane with carbon dioxide over vanadium magnesium oxides [3, 4]. We discussed the influence of vanadium loading and the preparation method on the catalyst activity and its phase composition."

[2] "This report deals with the dehydrogenation of isobutane to isobutene with carbon dioxide over different vanadium containing catalysts. Effects of the support on the conversion of isobutane and selectivity to isobutene will be discussed in terms of redox and acid-base properties of the catalysts."

[3] "The activity of the supported vanadium oxide catalysts during the dehydrogenation of isobutane in the presence and absence of carbon dioxide decreases in the order Cact >> Al2O3 > SiO2 > ZnO > La2O3 > CeO2 > TiO2 ≈ ZrO2."

[4] "The high activity of the first four catalysts is correlated with the their ability to undergo reduction at lower temperatures. Moreover, the highest isobutane conversions were obtained over the VOx/Cact and VOx/Al2O3, characterized by considerable acidity, which is probably related to the sorption of isobutane on the catalyst surface."

The literature does not directly address the historical evolution of research on vanadium oxide catalysts as alternatives to Pt and CrOx for paraffin dehydrogenation since the 1980s. However, it does provide insights into current research on vanadium oxide catalysts for isobutane dehydrogenation.

The study explores various supported vanadium oxide catalysts for isobutane dehydrogenation in the presence of carbon dioxide. The researchers investigated the effects of different supports on catalyst performance, focusing on the conversion of isobutane and selectivity to isobutene.

Key factors influencing the behavior of vanadium species in these catalysts include:

1. Support type: The activity of catalysts varies significantly depending on the support material used, with the order of effectiveness being Cact >> Al2O3 > SiO2 > ZnO > La2O3 > CeO2 > TiO2 ≈ ZrO2.

2. Redox properties: The high activity of the most effective catalysts (Cact, Al2O3, SiO2, and ZnO) is correlated with their ability to undergo reduction at lower temperatures.

3. Acidity: The highest isobutane conversions were obtained with VOx/Cact and VOx/Al2O3, which are characterized by considerable acidity. This acidity is thought to be related to the sorption of isobutane on the catalyst surface.

4. Preparation method: The study mentions that previous research examined the influence of vanadium loading and preparation method on catalyst activity and phase composition.

While the document does not explicitly discuss surface area or metal loading, it implies that these factors, along with the nature of the support, play crucial roles in determining the properties and performance of vanadium oxide catalysts in isobutane dehydrogenation reactions.

该文献并未直接讨论自1980年代以来钒氧化物催化剂作为Pt和CrOx替代品用于烷烃脱氢的研究演变历史。然而，它确实提供了关于当前钒氧化物催化剂用于异丁烷脱氢的研究见解。

这项研究探讨了各种负载型钒氧化物催化剂在二氧化碳存在下进行异丁烷脱氢的情况。研究人员调查了不同载体对催化剂性能的影响，重点关注异丁烷的转化率和异丁烯的选择性。

影响这些催化剂中钒物种行为的关键因素包括：

1. 载体类型：催化剂的活性因所使用的载体材料而显著不同，有效性顺序为Cact >> Al2O3 > SiO2 > ZnO > La2O3 > CeO2 > TiO2 ≈ ZrO2。

2. 氧化还原性能：最有效催化剂（Cact、Al2O3、SiO2和ZnO）的高活性与它们在较低温度下发生还原的能力相关。

3. 酸性：在VOx/Cact和VOx/Al2O3上获得了最高的异丁烷转化率，这两种催化剂具有相当大的酸性。这种酸性被认为与异丁烷在催化剂表面的吸附有关。

4. 制备方法：研究提到先前的研究考察了钒负载量和制备方法对催化剂活性和相组成的影响。

虽然文档没有明确讨论表面积或金属负载量，但它暗示这些因素，连同载体的性质，在决定钒氧化物催化剂在异丁烷脱氢反应中的性能和特性方面起着至关重要的作用。
