[1] "In our previous papers we presented the results of the dehydrogenation of isobutane with carbon dioxide over vanadium magnesium oxides [3, 4]. We discussed the influence of vanadium loading and the preparation method on the catalyst activity and its phase composition."

[2] "This report deals with the dehydrogenation of isobutane to isobutene with carbon dioxide over different vanadium containing catalysts. Effects of the support on the conversion of isobutane and selectivity to isobutene will be discussed in terms of redox and acid-base properties of the catalysts."

[3] "The activity of the supported vanadium oxide catalysts during the dehydrogenation of isobutane in the presence and absence of carbon dioxide decreases in the order Cact >> Al2O3 > SiO2 > ZnO > La2O3 > CeO2 > TiO2  ZrO2."

[4] "The high activity of the first four catalysts is correlated with the their ability to undergo reduction at lower temperatures. Moreover, the highest isobutane conversions were obtained over the VOx/Cact and VOx/Al2O3, characterized by considerable acidity, which is probably related to the sorption of isobutane on the catalyst surface."

The literature does not directly address the historical evolution of vanadium oxide catalyst research since the 1980s or compare them to Pt and CrOx catalysts. However, it does provide insights into current research on vanadium oxide catalysts for paraffin dehydrogenation:

The study explores various supported vanadium oxide catalysts for isobutane dehydrogenation, examining the effects of different supports on catalyst performance. The researchers investigated factors such as support type, redox properties, and acid-base characteristics to understand their influence on isobutane conversion and isobutene selectivity.

Key findings include:

1. Support type significantly affects catalyst activity, with the order of effectiveness being Cact >> Al2O3 > SiO2 > ZnO > La2O3 > CeO2 > TiO2 ≈ ZrO2.

2. The most active catalysts (Cact, Al2O3, SiO2, ZnO) exhibited lower reduction temperatures, suggesting a correlation between reducibility and catalytic performance.

3. Acidity plays a role in catalyst effectiveness, with VOx/Cact and VOx/Al2O3 showing the highest isobutane conversions, likely due to their considerable acidity facilitating isobutane sorption.

4. The study considered the influence of carbon dioxide on the dehydrogenation reaction, comparing results with and without CO2 presence.

While the literature doesn't explicitly discuss surface area or metal loading effects, it demonstrates that current research focuses on optimizing vanadium oxide catalysts by manipulating support materials and understanding their physicochemical properties.

该文献并未直接讨论自1980年代以来钒氧化物催化剂研究的历史演变，也没有将其与Pt和CrOx催化剂进行比较。然而，它确实提供了关于当前钒氧化物催化剂用于烷烃脱氢的研究见解：

该研究探讨了各种负载型钒氧化物催化剂在异丁烷脱氢中的应用，考察了不同载体对催化剂性能的影响。研究人员调查了载体类型、氧化还原性质和酸碱特性等因素，以了解它们对异丁烷转化率和异丁烯选择性的影响。

主要发现包括：

1. 载体类型显著影响催化剂活性，有效性顺序为Cact >> Al2O3 > SiO2 > ZnO > La2O3 > CeO2 > TiO2 ≈ ZrO2。

2. 最活跃的催化剂（Cact、Al2O3、SiO2、ZnO）表现出较低的还原温度，表明还原性与催化性能之间存在相关性。

3. 酸性在催化剂效能中起作用，VOx/Cact和VOx/Al2O3表现出最高的异丁烷转化率，这可能是由于它们的较强酸性有利于异丁烷的吸附。

4. 该研究考虑了二氧化碳对脱氢反应的影响，比较了有无CO2存在时的结果。

虽然文献没有明确讨论表面积或金属负载量的影响，但它表明当前研究重点是通过操纵载体材料和理解其物理化学性质来优化钒氧化物催化剂。
