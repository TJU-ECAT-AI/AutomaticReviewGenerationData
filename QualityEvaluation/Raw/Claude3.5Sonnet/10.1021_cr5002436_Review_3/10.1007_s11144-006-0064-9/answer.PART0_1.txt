[1] "In our previous papers we presented the results of the dehydrogenation of isobutane with carbon dioxide over vanadium magnesium oxides [3, 4]. We discussed the influence of vanadium loading and the preparation method on the catalyst activity and its phase composition."

[2] "This report deals with the dehydrogenation of isobutane to isobutene with carbon dioxide over different vanadium containing catalysts. Effects of the support on the conversion of isobutane and selectivity to isobutene will be discussed in terms of redox and acid-base properties of the catalysts."

[3] "The activity of the supported vanadium oxide catalysts during the dehydrogenation of isobutane in the presence and absence of carbon dioxide decreases in the order Cact >> Al2O3 > SiO2 > ZnO > La2O3 > CeO2 > TiO2  ZrO2."

[4] "The high activity of the first four catalysts is correlated with the their ability to undergo reduction at lower temperatures. Moreover, the highest isobutane conversions were obtained over the VOx/Cact and VOx/Al2O3, characterized by considerable acidity, which is probably related to the sorption of isobutane on the catalyst surface."

The literature does not provide a comprehensive historical overview of vanadium oxide-based catalysts as alternatives to Pt and CrOx for paraffin dehydrogenation since the 1980s. However, it does discuss some factors influencing the research on vanadium-based catalysts for isobutane dehydrogenation.

The study explores the use of various supports for vanadium oxide catalysts in isobutane dehydrogenation, including carbon, metal oxides, and silica. The researchers investigated how different supports affect the conversion of isobutane and selectivity to isobutene.

Key variables influencing the nature and behavior of vanadium species in these catalysts include:

1. Support type: The activity of supported vanadium oxide catalysts varies significantly depending on the support material.

2. Redox properties: The ability of catalysts to undergo reduction at lower temperatures correlates with higher activity.

3. Acidity: Catalysts with considerable acidity, such as VOx/Cact and VOx/Al2O3, showed the highest isobutane conversions, likely due to enhanced isobutane sorption on the catalyst surface.

4. Preparation method: The study mentions that previous work examined the influence of preparation methods on catalyst activity and phase composition.

5. Vanadium loading: Previous work by the authors also investigated the effect of vanadium loading on catalyst performance.

While the document doesn't provide a comprehensive evolution of research since the 1980s, it demonstrates ongoing efforts to optimize vanadium oxide-based catalysts for paraffin dehydrogenation by manipulating various parameters such as support material, preparation method, and metal loading.

该文献并未提供自1980年代以来钒氧化物基催化剂作为铂和铬氧化物催化剂替代品用于烷烃脱氢的全面历史概述。然而，它确实讨论了一些影响钒基催化剂在异丁烷脱氢研究中的因素。

该研究探讨了各种载体对钒氧化物催化剂在异丁烷脱氢中的应用，包括碳、金属氧化物和二氧化硅。研究人员调查了不同载体如何影响异丁烷的转化率和异丁烯的选择性。

影响这些催化剂中钒物种性质和行为的关键变量包括：

1. 载体类型：不同载体材料对负载型钒氧化物催化剂的活性影响显著。

2. 氧化还原性质：催化剂在较低温度下还原的能力与较高的活性相关。

3. 酸性：具有较强酸性的催化剂，如VOx/Cact和VOx/Al2O3，显示出最高的异丁烷转化率，这可能是由于催化剂表面对异丁烷的吸附增强。

4. 制备方法：该研究提到，先前的工作研究了制备方法对催化剂活性和相组成的影响。

5. 钒负载量：作者之前的工作也研究了钒负载量对催化剂性能的影响。

虽然该文档没有提供自1980年代以来研究演变的全面概述，但它展示了通过操纵各种参数（如载体材料、制备方法和金属负载量）来优化钒氧化物基催化剂用于烷烃脱氢的持续努力。
