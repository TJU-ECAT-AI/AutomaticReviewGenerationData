[1] "The great demand for olefins as a feedstock for industrial processes is the reason why the dehydrogenation of hydrocarbons is an important commercial process."

[2] "This report deals with the dehydrogenation of isobutane to isobutene with carbon dioxide over different vanadium containing catalysts. Effects of the support on the conversion of isobutane and selectivity to isobutene will be discussed in terms of redox and acid-base properties of the catalysts."

[3] "All of the catalysts listed in Table 1 were prepared to contain a nominal 20 wt.% of vanadium pentoxide."

[4] "The activity of the supported vanadium oxide catalysts during the dehydrogenation of isobutane in the presence and absence of carbon dioxide decreases in the order Cact >> Al2O3 > SiO2 > ZnO > La2O3 > CeO2 > TiO2  ZrO2."

[5] "The high activity of the first four catalysts is correlated with the their ability to undergo reduction at lower temperatures. Moreover, the highest isobutane conversions were obtained over the VOx/Cact and VOx/Al2O3, characterized by considerable acidity, which is probably related to the sorption of isobutane on the catalyst surface."

The literature does not provide a comprehensive historical overview of vanadium oxide-based catalysts research since the 1980s or explicitly compare them to Pt and CrOx catalysts. However, it does offer some insights into current research on vanadium oxide catalysts for paraffin dehydrogenation:

1. The study explores vanadium oxide catalysts supported on various carriers for isobutane dehydrogenation, driven by the high demand for olefins in industrial processes.

2. The research focuses on how different supports affect isobutane conversion and isobutene selectivity, examining the redox and acid-base properties of the catalysts.

3. Carrier type significantly influences catalyst activity, with the order of effectiveness being Cact >> Al2O3 > SiO2 > ZnO > La2O3 > CeO2 > TiO2 ≈ ZrO2.

4. Support surface area and metal loading are important variables, with all catalysts prepared to contain 20 wt.% vanadium pentoxide.

5. The nature and behavior of vanadium species are influenced by the support, with the most active catalysts (e.g., VOx/Cact and VOx/Al2O3) characterized by lower reduction temperatures and considerable acidity, which affects isobutane sorption on the catalyst surface.

While the document doesn't directly address the evolution of research since the 1980s or comparisons to Pt and CrOx catalysts, it demonstrates ongoing interest in optimizing vanadium oxide-based catalysts for paraffin dehydrogenation by exploring various supports and their effects on catalyst performance.

虽然文献没有提供自1980年代以来钒氧化物催化剂研究的全面历史概述，也没有明确将其与Pt和CrOx催化剂进行比较，但它确实提供了一些关于当前钒氧化物催化剂用于烷烃脱氢的研究见解：

1. 该研究探索了各种载体上的钒氧化物催化剂用于异丁烷脱氢，这是由工业过程中对烯烃的高需求所驱动的。

2. 研究重点关注不同载体如何影响异丁烷转化率和异丁烯选择性，检验了催化剂的氧化还原和酸碱性质。

3. 载体类型显著影响催化剂活性，有效性顺序为Cact >> Al2O3 > SiO2 > ZnO > La2O3 > CeO2 > TiO2 ≈ ZrO2。

4. 载体表面积和金属负载量是重要变量，所有催化剂都制备为含有20重量%的五氧化二钒。

5. 钒物种的性质和行为受载体影响，最活跃的催化剂（如VOx/Cact和VOx/Al2O3）具有较低的还原温度和较强的酸性，这影响了异丁烷在催化剂表面的吸附。

虽然文档没有直接讨论自1980年代以来研究的演变或与Pt和CrOx催化剂的比较，但它显示了对优化钒氧化物基催化剂用于烷烃脱氢的持续兴趣，通过探索各种载体及其对催化剂性能的影响。
