[1] "Selective Oxidative Dehydrogenation of Propane Over V-Mg-O Catalysts"

[2] "(at 500-540 C; change of the propane/O2 ratio from 1:2 to 1:1 results in a decrease in propane conversion (33 to 23%) and an increase in selectivity of propene formation (43 to 53%))."

The literature does not provide sufficient information to fully answer the question about the factors driving exploration of vanadium oxide-based catalysts as alternatives to Pt and CrOx for paraffin dehydrogenation, or how research in this area has evolved since the 1980s. The document only mentions a study on V-Mg-O catalysts for propane dehydrogenation, without comparing to other catalyst types or discussing historical trends.

The text does provide some insight into how variables influence catalyst behavior. It shows that changing the propane/O2 ratio from 1:2 to 1:1 affects both propane conversion and propene selectivity. Specifically, decreasing the amount of oxygen relative to propane leads to lower conversion (from 33% to 23%) but higher selectivity for propene formation (from 43% to 53%). This suggests that the reactant ratio is an important variable in controlling catalyst performance for this reaction.

The study was conducted at temperatures between 500-540°C, indicating that temperature is another key variable affecting catalyst behavior. However, the document does not provide information about how carrier type, support surface area, or metal loading influence vanadium species in these catalysts.

文献没有提供足够的信息来全面回答关于推动钒氧化物基催化剂作为Pt和CrOx的替代品用于烷烃脱氢的因素,或者这一领域的研究自1980年代以来如何发展的问题。该文档仅提到了一项关于V-Mg-O催化剂用于丙烷脱氢的研究,没有与其他类型的催化剂进行比较或讨论历史趋势。

文本确实提供了一些关于变量如何影响催化剂行为的洞察。它表明,将丙烷/O2比从1:2改变为1:1会影响丙烷转化率和丙烯选择性。具体来说,相对于丙烷减少氧气量会导致转化率降低(从33%降至23%),但丙烯生成的选择性提高(从43%提高到53%)。这表明反应物比例是控制该反应催化剂性能的一个重要变量。

研究在500-540°C的温度范围内进行,表明温度是影响催化剂行为的另一个关键变量。然而,该文档没有提供关于载体类型、支撑表面积或金属负载如何影响这些催化剂中钒物种的信息。
