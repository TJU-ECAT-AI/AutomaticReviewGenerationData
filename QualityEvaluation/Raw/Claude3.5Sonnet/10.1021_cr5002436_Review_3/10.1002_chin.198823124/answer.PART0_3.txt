[1] "Selective Oxidative Dehydrogenation of Propane Over V-Mg-O Catalysts"
[2] "(at 500-540 C; change of the propane/O2 ratio from 1:2 to 1:1 results in a decrease in propane conversion (33 to 23%) and an increase in selectivity of propene formation (43 to 53%))."

The literature provides limited information to fully answer the question about the evolution of vanadium oxide-based catalysts research since the 1980s and the influence of various factors on vanadium species behavior. However, it does indicate that V-Mg-O catalysts have been explored for selective oxidative dehydrogenation of propane, which is relevant to paraffin dehydrogenation.

The study examined V-Mg-O catalysts at temperatures between 500-540°C. It found that changing the propane/O2 ratio from 1:2 to 1:1 affected both propane conversion and propene formation selectivity. Specifically, propane conversion decreased from 33% to 23%, while propene formation selectivity increased from 43% to 53%.

This information suggests that reaction conditions, particularly the ratio of reactants, can significantly influence the performance of vanadium-based catalysts in paraffin dehydrogenation reactions. However, the document does not provide specific details about carrier type, support surface area, or metal loading effects on vanadium species in these catalysts.

该文献提供的信息有限，无法全面回答关于钒氧化物基催化剂研究自1980年代以来的演变以及各种因素对钒物种行为影响的问题。然而，它确实指出V-Mg-O催化剂已被探索用于丙烷的选择性氧化脱氢，这与烷烃脱氢相关。

研究在500-540°C的温度范围内考察了V-Mg-O催化剂。研究发现，将丙烷/O2比例从1:2改变为1:1会影响丙烷转化率和丙烯形成的选择性。具体来说，丙烷转化率从33%降至23%，而丙烯形成的选择性从43%增加到53%。

这一信息表明，反应条件，特别是反应物的比例，可以显著影响钒基催化剂在烷烃脱氢反应中的性能。然而，该文献并未提供关于载体类型、支持物表面积或金属负载对这些催化剂中钒物种影响的具体细节。
