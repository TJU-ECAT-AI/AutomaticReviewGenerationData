The provided literature does not contain sufficient information to fully answer the question about the factors driving exploration of vanadium oxide-based catalysts as alternatives to Pt and CrOx for paraffin dehydrogenation, how research has evolved since the 1980s, or how variables like carrier type, support surface area, and metal loading influence vanadium species behavior.

However, the abstract does indicate that V-Mg-O catalysts were being studied for selective oxidative dehydrogenation of propane in the late 1980s. The research examined how changing the propane/O2 ratio affected propane conversion and propene selectivity at high temperatures (500-540°C). Specifically, decreasing the O2 concentration relative to propane reduced overall propane conversion but improved selectivity for propene formation.

This suggests researchers were investigating how to optimize reaction conditions to balance conversion and selectivity when using vanadium-based catalysts for alkane dehydrogenation. The study of V-Mg-O systems indicates exploration of alternatives to traditional platinum or chromium oxide catalysts was underway by this time, likely motivated by factors such as cost or improved performance, though the specific drivers are not stated in this brief abstract.

提供的文献不包含足够的信息来全面回答关于推动钒氧化物基催化剂作为Pt和CrOx的替代品用于烷烃脱氢的因素,自1980年代以来研究如何演变,或者载体类型、支撑表面积和金属负载等变量如何影响钒物种行为的问题。

然而,摘要确实表明,在20世纪80年代末,研究人员正在研究V-Mg-O催化剂用于丙烷的选择性氧化脱氢。该研究考察了在高温(500-540°C)下改变丙烷/O2比率如何影响丙烷转化率和丙烯选择性。具体来说,降低O2相对于丙烷的浓度会减少总体丙烷转化率,但提高了丙烯形成的选择性。

这表明研究人员正在研究如何优化反应条件,以在使用钒基催化剂进行烷烃脱氢时平衡转化率和选择性。对V-Mg-O系统的研究表明,到这个时候,对传统铂或铬氧化物催化剂替代品的探索已经在进行中,可能是由成本或性能改进等因素驱动的,尽管这个简短的摘要中没有明确说明具体的驱动因素。

The research examined the effects of changing the propane/O2 ratio from 1:2 to 1:1 at temperatures between 500-540°C. This change resulted in a decrease in propane conversion from 33% to 23%, but an increase in propene formation selectivity from 43% to 53%. This suggests that the propane/O2 ratio is an important variable affecting both conversion and selectivity in vanadium-based catalysts for propane dehydrogenation.

The literature provides limited information to fully answer the question about the evolution of vanadium oxide-based catalysts research since the 1980s and the influence of various factors on vanadium species behavior. However, it does indicate that V-Mg-O catalysts have been explored for selective oxidative dehydrogenation of propane, which is relevant to paraffin dehydrogenation.

The study examined V-Mg-O catalysts at temperatures between 500-540°C. It found that changing the propane/O2 ratio from 1:2 to 1:1 affected both propane conversion and propene formation selectivity. Specifically, propane conversion decreased from 33% to 23%, while propene formation selectivity increased from 43% to 53%.

This information suggests that reaction conditions, particularly the ratio of reactants, can significantly influence the performance of vanadium-based catalysts in paraffin dehydrogenation reactions. However, the document does not provide specific details about carrier type, support surface area, or metal loading effects on vanadium species in these catalysts.

The literature does not provide sufficient information to fully answer the question about the factors driving exploration of vanadium oxide-based catalysts as alternatives to Pt and CrOx for paraffin dehydrogenation, or how research in this area has evolved since the 1980s. The document only mentions a study on V-Mg-O catalysts for propane dehydrogenation, without comparing to other catalyst types or discussing historical trends.

The text does provide some insight into how variables influence catalyst behavior. It shows that changing the propane/O2 ratio from 1:2 to 1:1 affects both propane conversion and propene selectivity. Specifically, decreasing the amount of oxygen relative to propane leads to lower conversion (from 33% to 23%) but higher selectivity for propene formation (from 43% to 53%). This suggests that the reactant ratio is an important variable in controlling catalyst performance for this reaction.

The study was conducted at temperatures between 500-540°C, indicating that temperature is another key variable affecting catalyst behavior. However, the document does not provide information about how carrier type, support surface area, or metal loading influence vanadium species in these catalysts.
