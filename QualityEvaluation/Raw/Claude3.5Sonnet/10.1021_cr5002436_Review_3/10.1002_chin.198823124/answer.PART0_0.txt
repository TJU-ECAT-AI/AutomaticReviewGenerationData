[1] "Selective Oxidative Dehydrogenation of Propane Over V-Mg-O Catalysts"
[2] "(at 500-540 C; change of the propane/O2 ratio from 1:2 to 1:1 results in a decrease in propane conversion (33 to 23%) and an increase in selectivity of propene formation (43 to 53%))."

The provided literature does not contain sufficient information to fully answer the question about the factors driving exploration of vanadium oxide-based catalysts as alternatives to Pt and CrOx for paraffin dehydrogenation, how research has evolved since the 1980s, or how variables like carrier type, support surface area, and metal loading influence vanadium species behavior.

However, the abstract does indicate that V-Mg-O catalysts were being studied for selective oxidative dehydrogenation of propane in the late 1980s. The research examined how changing the propane/O2 ratio affected propane conversion and propene selectivity at high temperatures (500-540°C). Specifically, decreasing the O2 concentration relative to propane reduced overall propane conversion but improved selectivity for propene formation.

This suggests researchers were investigating how to optimize reaction conditions to balance conversion and selectivity when using vanadium-based catalysts for alkane dehydrogenation. The study of V-Mg-O systems indicates exploration of alternatives to traditional platinum or chromium oxide catalysts was underway by this time, likely motivated by factors such as cost or improved performance, though the specific drivers are not stated in this brief abstract.

提供的文献不包含足够的信息来全面回答关于推动钒氧化物基催化剂作为Pt和CrOx的替代品用于烷烃脱氢的因素,自1980年代以来研究如何演变,或者载体类型、支撑表面积和金属负载等变量如何影响钒物种行为的问题。

然而,摘要确实表明,在20世纪80年代末,研究人员正在研究V-Mg-O催化剂用于丙烷的选择性氧化脱氢。该研究考察了在高温(500-540°C)下改变丙烷/O2比率如何影响丙烷转化率和丙烯选择性。具体来说,降低O2相对于丙烷的浓度会减少总体丙烷转化率,但提高了丙烯形成的选择性。

这表明研究人员正在研究如何优化反应条件,以在使用钒基催化剂进行烷烃脱氢时平衡转化率和选择性。对V-Mg-O系统的研究表明,到这个时候,对传统铂或铬氧化物催化剂替代品的探索已经在进行中,可能是由成本或性能改进等因素驱动的,尽管这个简短的摘要中没有明确说明具体的驱动因素。
