[1] "Selective Oxidative Dehydrogenation of Propane Over V-Mg-O Catalysts"
[2] "(at 500-540 C; change of the propane/O2 ratio from 1:2 to 1:1 results in a decrease in propane conversion (33 to 23%) and an increase in selectivity of propene formation (43 to 53%))."

The provided literature does not contain sufficient information to fully answer the question about the factors driving exploration of vanadium oxide-based catalysts as alternatives to Pt and CrOx for paraffin dehydrogenation, the evolution of research since the 1980s, or the influence of variables like carrier type, support surface area, and metal loading on vanadium species behavior.

However, the literature does mention a study on V-Mg-O catalysts for selective oxidative dehydrogenation of propane. The research examined the effects of changing the propane/O2 ratio from 1:2 to 1:1 at temperatures between 500-540°C. This change resulted in a decrease in propane conversion from 33% to 23%, but an increase in propene formation selectivity from 43% to 53%. This suggests that the propane/O2 ratio is an important variable affecting both conversion and selectivity in vanadium-based catalysts for propane dehydrogenation.

提供的文献没有足够的信息来全面回答关于推动钒氧化物基催化剂作为Pt和CrOx替代品用于烷烃脱氢的因素、自1980年代以来研究的演变、或者载体类型、支撑表面积和金属负载量等变量对钒物种行为的影响等问题。

然而，文献确实提到了一项关于V-Mg-O催化剂用于选择性氧化脱氢丙烷的研究。该研究考察了在500-540°C温度下，将丙烷/O2比从1:2改变为1:1的效果。这种变化导致丙烷转化率从33%降低到23%，但丙烯生成的选择性从43%提高到53%。这表明丙烷/O2比是影响钒基催化剂在丙烷脱氢过程中转化率和选择性的一个重要变量。
