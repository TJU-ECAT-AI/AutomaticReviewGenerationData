The exploration of vanadium oxide-based catalysts as alternatives to Pt and CrOx for paraffin dehydrogenation has been driven by several factors:

1. Increasing demand for light olefins and insufficient capacity of current production methods.

2. The need for more selective and stable alkane-olefin conversion processes.

3. The potential of vanadium oxide catalysts to be both active and selective for dehydrogenation reactions.

Research in this area has evolved since the 1980s from focusing primarily on chromium oxide and platinum catalysts to exploring oxide systems like supported vanadium oxide. Studies have shown that V/Al2O3 catalysts can achieve high conversion (up to 50%) and selectivity (up to 90%) in butane dehydrogenation at 853 K.

The literature does not provide specific information on how variables such as carrier type, support surface area, and metal loading influence the nature and behavior of vanadium species in these catalysts. However, it does mention that pretreatment methods can affect catalyst performance, suggesting that these variables may play a role in determining catalyst properties and behavior.

作为铂和氧化铬催化剂在烷烃脱氢反应中的替代品，钒氧化物基催化剂的研究受到以下几个因素的推动：

1. 轻烯烃需求增加，而现有的蒸汽裂解和催化裂解生产方法产能不足。

2. 需要更具选择性和稳定性的烷烃-烯烃转化工艺。

3. 钒氧化物催化剂在脱氢反应中表现出良好的活性和选择性。

自20世纪80年代以来，该领域的研究从主要关注氧化铬和铂催化剂发展到探索如支持的钒氧化物等氧化物体系。研究表明，V/Al2O3催化剂在853 K下进行丁烷脱氢时可达到高转化率（高达50%）和选择性（高达90%）。

文献中没有提供关于载体类型、载体表面积和金属负载量等变量如何影响这些催化剂中钒物种的性质和行为的具体信息。然而，文献确实提到了预处理方法可以影响催化剂性能，这表明这些变量可能在决定催化剂性质和行为方面发挥作用。
