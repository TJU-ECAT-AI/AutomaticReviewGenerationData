[1] "The increasing demand for light olefins and the insufficient capacity of current production by steam and catalytic cracking are the driving forces behind the investigation of alternative ways to manufacture these chemicals"

[2] "Currently, the most feasible processes on a commercial scale are catalytic dehydrogenation (DH) and oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of light alkanes"

[3] "Commercial catalysts for alkane DH processes are supported chromium oxide and platinum metal"

[4] "The possibility of using oxide systems other than chromia is being explored in an effort to make the alkaneolefin conversion process more selective and stable."

[5] "Supported vanadium oxide (VOx) catalysts for the ODH of light alkanes have been studied extensively. They have also been explored in the DH of light alkanes, including propane and butane, and show promise to be both active and selective for DH reactions."

[6] "Meanwhile, deactivation of VOx catalysts by coke species is also observed with time on stream in butane DH reactions. However, due to the limited number of studies on supported VOx for alkane DH, many questions remain unanswered"

Factors driving exploration of vanadium oxide catalysts as alternatives include:

1. Increasing demand for light olefins and insufficient production capacity from current methods. 

2. Need for more selective and stable alkane-to-olefin conversion processes.

3. Promise shown by supported vanadium oxide catalysts in being both active and selective for dehydrogenation reactions.

Research has evolved from focusing solely on chromium oxide and platinum catalysts to exploring oxide systems like supported vanadium oxide for both oxidative and non-oxidative dehydrogenation of light alkanes since the 1980s.

The literature does not provide specific information on how variables like carrier type, support surface area, and metal loading influence vanadium species. However, it notes that deactivation by coke formation occurs over time, and that many questions remain unanswered due to limited studies on supported vanadium oxide for alkane dehydrogenation. This suggests these variables likely play important roles that are not yet fully understood.

推动钒氧化物催化剂作为替代品探索的因素包括：

1. 轻烯烃需求增加和当前生产方法产能不足。

2. 需要更具选择性和稳定性的烷烃到烯烃转化过程。

3. 负载型钒氧化物催化剂在脱氢反应中表现出良好的活性和选择性。

自20世纪80年代以来，研究已从仅关注铬氧化物和铂催化剂发展到探索氧化物系统(如负载型钒氧化物)用于轻烷烃的氧化和非氧化脱氢。

文献没有提供载体类型、支持物表面积和金属负载量如何影响钒物种的具体信息。然而，它指出随着时间的推移会发生由焦炭形成引起的失活，并且由于对烷烃脱氢用负载型钒氧化物的研究有限，许多问题仍未得到解答。这表明这些变量可能起着重要作用，但尚未被完全理解。
