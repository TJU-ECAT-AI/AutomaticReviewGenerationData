[1] "The increasing demand for light olefins and the insufficient capacity of current production by steam and catalytic cracking are the driving forces behind the investigation of alternative ways to manufacture these chemicals"

[2] "Currently, the most feasible processes on a commercial scale are catalytic dehydrogenation (DH) and oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of light alkanes"

[3] "Commercial catalysts for alkane DH processes are supported chromium oxide and platinum metal"

[4] "The possibility of using oxide systems other than chromia is being explored in an effort to make the alkaneolefin conversion process more selective and stable."

The exploration of vanadium oxide-based catalysts as alternatives to Pt and CrOx for paraffin dehydrogenation has been driven by several factors:

1. Increasing demand for light olefins and insufficient capacity of current production methods.

2. The need for more selective and stable alkane-olefin conversion processes.

3. The potential of vanadium oxide catalysts to be both active and selective for dehydrogenation reactions.

Research in this area has evolved since the 1980s from focusing primarily on chromium oxide and platinum catalysts to exploring oxide systems like supported vanadium oxide. Studies have shown that V/Al2O3 catalysts can achieve high conversion (up to 50%) and selectivity (up to 90%) in butane dehydrogenation at 853 K.

The literature does not provide specific information on how variables such as carrier type, support surface area, and metal loading influence the nature and behavior of vanadium species in these catalysts. However, it does mention that pretreatment methods can affect catalyst performance, suggesting that these variables may play a role in determining catalyst properties and behavior.

作为铂和氧化铬催化剂在烷烃脱氢反应中的替代品，钒氧化物基催化剂的研究受到以下几个因素的推动：

1. 轻烯烃需求增加，而现有的蒸汽裂解和催化裂解生产方法产能不足。

2. 需要更具选择性和稳定性的烷烃-烯烃转化工艺。

3. 钒氧化物催化剂在脱氢反应中表现出良好的活性和选择性。

自20世纪80年代以来，该领域的研究从主要关注氧化铬和铂催化剂发展到探索如支持的钒氧化物等氧化物体系。研究表明，V/Al2O3催化剂在853 K下进行丁烷脱氢时可达到高转化率（高达50%）和选择性（高达90%）。

文献中没有提供关于载体类型、载体表面积和金属负载量等变量如何影响这些催化剂中钒物种的性质和行为的具体信息。然而，文献确实提到了预处理方法可以影响催化剂性能，这表明这些变量可能在决定催化剂性质和行为方面发挥作用。

Factors driving exploration of vanadium oxide catalysts as alternatives include:

1. Increasing demand for light olefins and insufficient production capacity from current methods. 

2. Need for more selective and stable alkane-to-olefin conversion processes.

3. Promise shown by supported vanadium oxide catalysts in being both active and selective for dehydrogenation reactions.

Research has evolved from focusing solely on chromium oxide and platinum catalysts to exploring oxide systems like supported vanadium oxide for both oxidative and non-oxidative dehydrogenation of light alkanes since the 1980s.

The literature does not provide specific information on how variables like carrier type, support surface area, and metal loading influence vanadium species. However, it notes that deactivation by coke formation occurs over time, and that many questions remain unanswered due to limited studies on supported vanadium oxide for alkane dehydrogenation. This suggests these variables likely play important roles that are not yet fully understood.

推动钒氧化物催化剂作为替代品探索的因素包括：

1. 轻烯烃需求增加和当前生产方法产能不足。

2. 需要更具选择性和稳定性的烷烃到烯烃转化过程。

3. 负载型钒氧化物催化剂在脱氢反应中表现出良好的活性和选择性。

自20世纪80年代以来，研究已从仅关注铬氧化物和铂催化剂发展到探索氧化物系统(如负载型钒氧化物)用于轻烷烃的氧化和非氧化脱氢。

文献没有提供载体类型、支持物表面积和金属负载量如何影响钒物种的具体信息。然而，它指出随着时间的推移会发生由焦炭形成引起的失活，并且由于对烷烃脱氢用负载型钒氧化物的研究有限，许多问题仍未得到解答。这表明这些变量可能起着重要作用，但尚未被完全理解。

Several factors have driven the exploration of vanadium oxide-based catalysts as alternatives for paraffin dehydrogenation:

1. Increasing demand for light olefins and insufficient capacity of current production methods.

2. The need for more selective and stable alkane-olefin conversion processes compared to existing chromium oxide and platinum catalysts.

3. Promising results showing high activity and selectivity of supported vanadium oxide catalysts for dehydrogenation reactions.

Research in this area has evolved since the 1980s from focusing mainly on chromium and platinum catalysts to exploring alternative oxide systems like vanadium oxide. Studies have expanded to include both catalytic dehydrogenation and oxidative dehydrogenation of light alkanes using supported vanadium oxide catalysts.

Variables influencing the nature and behavior of vanadium species in these catalysts include:

1. Support type (e.g. alumina)
2. Pretreatment methods
3. Reaction conditions (e.g. temperature)

The literature indicates that V/Al2O3 catalysts can achieve high conversion (up to 50%) and selectivity (90%) for butane dehydrogenation under optimized conditions. However, the document does not provide specific information on how support surface area and metal loading affect the vanadium species.
