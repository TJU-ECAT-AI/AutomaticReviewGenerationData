          [1] "The increasing demand for light olefins and the insufficient capacity of current production by steam and catalytic cracking are the driving forces behind the investigation of alternative ways to manufacture these chemicals"

[2] "Currently, the most feasible processes on a commercial scale are catalytic dehydrogenation (DH) and oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of light alkanes"

[3] "Commercial catalysts for alkane DH processes are supported chromium oxide and platinum metal"

[4] "The possibility of using oxide systems other than chromia is being explored in an effort to make the alkaneolefin conversion process more selective and stable."

[5] "Supported vanadium oxide (VOx) catalysts for the ODH of light alkanes have been studied extensively. They have also been explored in the DH of light alkanes, including propane and butane, and show promise to be both active and selective for DH reactions."

[6] "For example, depending on the pretreatment methods, V/Al2O3 can catalyze the DH of butanes at 853 K with conversion up to about 50% and selectivity to 90%"

[7] "Meanwhile, deactivation of VOx catalysts by coke species is also observed with time on stream in butane DH reactions. However, due to the limited number of studies on supported VOx for alkane DH, many questions remain unanswered"

          Factors driving the exploration of vanadium oxide-based catalysts as alternatives to Pt and CrOx for paraffin dehydrogenation include:

1. Increasing demand for light olefins and insufficient capacity of current production methods (steam and catalytic cracking).
2. The need for more selective and stable alkane-to-olefin conversion processes.
3. Promising activity and selectivity of supported vanadium oxide catalysts in dehydrogenation reactions.

Research in this area has evolved since the 1980s from focusing primarily on chromium oxide and platinum catalysts to exploring oxide systems like supported vanadium oxide. Studies have expanded to include both catalytic dehydrogenation (DH) and oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of light alkanes using supported vanadium oxide catalysts.

Variables influencing the nature and behavior of vanadium species in these catalysts include:

1. Support type (e.g., alumina)
2. Pretreatment methods
3. Reaction conditions (e.g., temperature)

The literature indicates that V/Al2O3 catalysts can achieve high conversion (up to 50%) and selectivity (90%) for butane dehydrogenation under optimized conditions. However, deactivation by coke formation is observed over time, and many questions remain unanswered due to the limited number of studies on supported VOx for alkane DH. The document does not provide specific information on how support surface area and metal loading affect the vanadium species, suggesting that these variables likely play important roles that are not yet fully understood.

          作为铂和氧化铬催化剂在烷烃脱氢反应中的替代品，钒氧化物基催化剂的研究受到以下几个因素的推动：

1. 轻烯烃需求增加，而现有的蒸汽裂解和催化裂解生产方法产能不足。
2. 需要更具选择性和稳定性的烷烃到烯烃的转化过程。
3. 负载型钒氧化物催化剂在脱氢反应中表现出良好的活性和选择性。

自20世纪80年代以来，该领域的研究已从主要关注铬氧化物和铂催化剂发展到探索如支持的钒氧化物等氧化物体系。研究已扩展到使用负载型钒氧化物催化剂进行轻烷烃的催化脱氢（DH）和氧化脱氢（ODH）。

影响这些催化剂中钒物种性质和行为的变量包括：

1. 载体类型（如氧化铝）
2. 预处理方法
3. 反应条件（如温度）

文献表明，在优化条件下，V/Al2O3催化剂可以实现高转化率（高达50%）和选择性（90%）的丁烷脱氢。然而，随时间推移会观察到由于积碳形成而导致的失活，并且由于对烷烃DH反应中负载型VOx催化剂的研究有限，许多问题仍然没有答案。该文档没有提供关于载体表面积和金属负载量如何影响钒物种的具体信息，这表明这些变量可能起着重要作用，但尚未被完全理解。
