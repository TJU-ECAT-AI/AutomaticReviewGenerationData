The exploration of vanadium oxide-based catalysts as alternatives to Pt and CrOx for paraffin dehydrogenation has been driven by several factors:

1. Increasing demand for light olefins and insufficient capacity of current production methods.

2. The need for more selective and stable alkane-to-olefin conversion processes.

3. The promise shown by supported vanadium oxide catalysts in terms of activity and selectivity for dehydrogenation reactions.

Research in this area has evolved since the 1980s from initial studies on supported vanadium oxide catalysts for oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of light alkanes to more recent explorations of their use in direct dehydrogenation (DH) of propane and butane. 

While the literature does not specifically address how variables such as carrier type, support surface area, and metal loading influence the nature and behavior of vanadium species in these catalysts, it does mention that deactivation by coke formation is observed over time. The limited number of studies on supported VOx for alkane DH means that many questions about these variables and their effects remain unanswered.

作为铂和氧化铬催化剂在烷烃脱氢反应中的替代品，钒氧化物基催化剂的研究受到以下几个因素的推动：

1. 轻烯烃需求增加，而现有的蒸汽裂解和催化裂解产能不足。

2. 需要更具选择性和稳定性的烷烃到烯烃的转化过程。

3. 负载型钒氧化物催化剂在脱氢反应活性和选择性方面表现出良好的前景。

自20世纪80年代以来，该领域的研究已经从最初对轻烷烃氧化脱氢(ODH)用负载型钒氧化物催化剂的研究，发展到最近对丙烷和丁烷直接脱氢(DH)的探索。

虽然文献中没有具体提到载体类型、支撑体表面积和金属负载量等变量如何影响这些催化剂中钒物种的性质和行为，但确实提到了随时间推移会观察到由于积碳形成而导致的失活。由于对烷烃DH反应中负载型VOx催化剂的研究有限，关于这些变量及其影响的许多问题仍然没有答案。
