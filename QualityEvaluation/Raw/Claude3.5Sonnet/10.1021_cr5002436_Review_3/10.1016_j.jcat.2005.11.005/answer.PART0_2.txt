Vanadium oxide-based catalysts have been explored as alternatives to Pt and CrOx for paraffin dehydrogenation due to several factors:

1. Increasing demand for light olefins and insufficient capacity of current production methods.

2. The need for more selective and stable catalysts for alkane-to-olefin conversion processes.

3. Promising activity and selectivity of supported VOx catalysts in dehydrogenation reactions.

Research in this area has evolved since the 1980s from initial explorations of VOx catalysts for oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) to more recent studies on their use in direct dehydrogenation (DH) of light alkanes like propane and butane. 

The literature does not provide specific information on how variables such as carrier type, support surface area, and metal loading influence the nature and behavior of vanadium species in these catalysts. However, it does mention that deactivation due to coke formation is observed in VOx catalysts during butane DH reactions, suggesting that these factors may play a role in catalyst performance and stability.

The document also notes that many questions remain unanswered due to the limited number of studies on supported VOx for alkane DH, indicating that research in this area is still ongoing and evolving.

钒氧化物基催化剂被探索作为铂和氧化铬催化剂在烷烃脱氢反应中的替代品，原因如下：

1. 轻烯烃需求不断增加，而现有的蒸汽裂解和催化裂解生产方法产能不足。

2. 需要开发更具选择性和稳定性的烷烃转化为烯烃的催化剂。

3. 负载型钒氧化物催化剂在脱氢反应中表现出良好的活性和选择性。

自20世纪80年代以来，该领域的研究已经从最初探索钒氧化物催化剂用于氧化脱氢(ODH)，发展到最近研究其在轻烷烃（如丙烷和丁烷）直接脱氢(DH)中的应用。

文献中没有提供关于载体类型、载体表面积和金属负载量等变量如何影响这些催化剂中钒物种的性质和行为的具体信息。然而，文献提到在丁烷DH反应中，钒氧化物催化剂会因焦炭形成而失活，这表明这些因素可能会影响催化剂的性能和稳定性。

文献还指出，由于对负载型钒氧化物催化剂在烷烃DH中的研究有限，许多问题仍未得到解答，这表明该领域的研究仍在进行和发展中。
