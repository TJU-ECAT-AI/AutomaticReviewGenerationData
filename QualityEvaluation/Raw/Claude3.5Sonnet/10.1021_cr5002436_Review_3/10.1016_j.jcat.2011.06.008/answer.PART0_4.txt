The given scientific literature does not contain any information about vanadium oxide-based catalysts for paraffin dehydrogenation. The document focuses on platinum-based catalysts, specifically Pt/Mg(In)(Al)O catalysts, for ethane and propane dehydrogenation. It does not discuss vanadium oxide catalysts or their development since the 1980s. The text also does not mention variables such as carrier type, support surface area, or metal loading in relation to vanadium species. Therefore, this question cannot be answered based on the provided document.
