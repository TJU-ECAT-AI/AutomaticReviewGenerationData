The given scientific literature does not contain any information about vanadium oxide-based catalysts for paraffin dehydrogenation. The document focuses on platinum-based catalysts, particularly those promoted with indium, for ethane and propane dehydrogenation. It does not discuss vanadium oxide catalysts or their development since the 1980s. The text also does not mention variables like carrier type, support surface area, or metal loading in relation to vanadium species. Therefore, this question cannot be answered based on the provided document.

给定的科学文献中不包含任何关于钒氧化物基催化剂用于烷烃脱氢的信息。该文档主要讨论了以铂为基础的催化剂,特别是那些由铟促进的催化剂,用于乙烷和丙烷脱氢。它没有讨论钒氧化物催化剂或自20世纪80年代以来它们的发展。文本也没有提到载体类型、支撑表面积或金属负载等变量与钒物种的关系。因此,基于所提供的文档无法回答这个问题。
