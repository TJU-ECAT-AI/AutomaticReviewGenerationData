The given literature does not provide information to directly answer the question about the factors driving exploration of vanadium oxide-based catalysts as alternatives to Pt and CrOx for paraffin dehydrogenation, or how research in this area has evolved since the 1980s. The document focuses on a specific study of carbonaceous deposits on VOx/Al2O3 catalysts during butane dehydrogenation, rather than providing a broad overview of vanadium oxide catalyst development. It does not discuss comparisons to Pt or CrOx catalysts, nor does it cover the historical progression of research in this field. Additionally, the literature does not explore how variables like carrier type, support surface area, and metal loading influence vanadium species in these catalysts. The question cannot be adequately answered based solely on the information provided in this document.

给定的文献没有提供直接回答关于推动钒氧化物基催化剂作为Pt和CrOx替代品用于烷烃脱氢的因素的信息,也没有说明自1980年代以来该领域的研究如何发展。该文档集中于研究VOx/Al2O3催化剂在丁烷脱氢过程中的碳质沉积物,而不是提供钒氧化物催化剂开发的广泛概述。它没有讨论与Pt或CrOx催化剂的比较,也没有涵盖该领域研究的历史进程。此外,文献没有探讨载体类型、支撑体表面积和金属负载量等变量如何影响这些催化剂中的钒物种。仅基于本文档提供的信息,无法充分回答这个问题。
