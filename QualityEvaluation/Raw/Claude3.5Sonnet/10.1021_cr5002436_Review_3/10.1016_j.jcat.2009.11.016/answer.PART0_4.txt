The given literature does not contain information directly addressing the factors driving exploration of vanadium oxide catalysts as alternatives to Pt and CrOx for paraffin dehydrogenation, or how research in this area has evolved since the 1980s. The document focuses on the catalytic activity of carbonaceous deposits formed during butane dehydrogenation over VOx/Al2O3 catalysts, rather than discussing the broader context of vanadium oxide catalyst development. There is also no specific discussion of how variables like carrier type, support surface area, and metal loading influence vanadium species in these catalysts.

给出的文献中没有直接涉及推动钒氧化物催化剂作为Pt和CrOx的替代品用于烷烃脱氢的因素,也没有讨论自1980年代以来该领域研究的演变情况。该文档主要关注VOx/Al2O3催化剂上正丁烷脱氢过程中形成的碳质沉积物的催化活性,而不是讨论钒氧化物催化剂开发的更广泛背景。文中也没有具体讨论载体类型、载体比表面积和金属负载量等变量如何影响这些催化剂中的钒物种。
