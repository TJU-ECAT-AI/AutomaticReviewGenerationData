The given literature does not contain information directly addressing the factors driving exploration of vanadium oxide catalysts as alternatives to Pt and CrOx for paraffin dehydrogenation, or how research in this area has evolved since the 1980s. The document also does not discuss how variables like carrier type, support surface area, and metal loading influence vanadium species in these catalysts. The text focuses more on the nature of carbonaceous deposits formed during butane dehydrogenation over VOx/Al2O3 catalysts and their potential catalytic activity, rather than on the historical development or structural factors influencing vanadium oxide catalysts.

给定的文献中并没有直接涉及推动钒氧化物催化剂作为铂和氧化铬替代品用于烷烃脱氢的因素,也没有讨论自1980年代以来该领域研究的演变情况。文献也没有探讨载体类型、载体表面积和金属负载量等变量如何影响这些催化剂中钒物种的性质。该文本更多地关注在VOx/Al2O3催化剂上进行丁烷脱氢过程中形成的碳质沉积物的性质及其潜在的催化活性,而不是钒氧化物催化剂的历史发展或影响其结构的因素。
