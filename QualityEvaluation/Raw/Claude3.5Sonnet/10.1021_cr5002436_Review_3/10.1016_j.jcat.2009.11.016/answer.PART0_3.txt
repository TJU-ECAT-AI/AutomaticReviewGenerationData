The given literature does not contain information specifically addressing the factors driving exploration of vanadium oxide-based catalysts as alternatives to Pt and CrOx for paraffin dehydrogenation, the evolution of research in this area since the 1980s, or how variables like carrier type, support surface area, and metal loading influence vanadium species in these catalysts. The text focuses on the catalytic activity of carbonaceous deposits formed during n-butane dehydrogenation over VOx/Al2O3 catalysts, rather than providing a historical perspective or detailed analysis of vanadium oxide catalyst development.

给出的文献中没有具体涉及推动钒氧化物基催化剂作为Pt和CrOx替代品用于烷烃脱氢的因素,该领域自1980年代以来的研究演变,或者载体类型、载体表面积和金属负载量等变量如何影响这些催化剂中钒物种的性质和行为。该文本主要关注在VOx/Al2O3催化剂上正丁烷脱氢过程中形成的含碳沉积物的催化活性,而不是提供钒氧化物催化剂开发的历史视角或详细分析。
