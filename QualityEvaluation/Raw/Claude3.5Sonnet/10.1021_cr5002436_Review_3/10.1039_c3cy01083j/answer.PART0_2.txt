[1] "Recently, we have demonstrated that the VOx/MCM-41 catalyst with highly dispersed, near to isolated VOx species showed similar selectivity and, most importantly, stable catalytic performance in several DH/regeneration cycles surpassing in quality the industrially relevant CrOx/MCM-41 and PtSn/Al2O3."

[2] "The aim of the current work was to further explore the potential of VOx-based catalysts for the DH reaction. To this end, we selected commercial Al2O3SiO2 materials (Siral), pure Al2O3 and SiO2 as supports to prepare catalysts free of crystalline V2O5 particles."

[3] "Al2O3, SiO2(MCM-41), and Al2O3SiO2 (Siral) with a SiO2 content varying from 1 to 70 wt.% were used to prepare supported catalysts with a V loading below one monolayer."

[4] "As the surface density of V increases, the red shift of the CT onset occurs for VOx/Al2O3 and VOx/Siral (Fig. 1) due to the appearance of polymerized VO4 entities linked via oxygen bridges."

[5] "The highest spacetime yield of propene was only 25% lower than that over industrially relevant PtSn/Al2O3 under the same reaction conditions."

Factors driving exploration of vanadium oxide-based catalysts as alternatives to Pt and CrOx for paraffin dehydrogenation include:

1. Potential for stable catalytic performance across multiple dehydrogenation/regeneration cycles
2. Ability to achieve high selectivity and yields comparable to industrial catalysts
3. Lower cost compared to precious metal catalysts like Pt

Research has evolved to focus on:

1. Using various supports like Al2O3, SiO2, and mixed Al2O3-SiO2 materials 
2. Optimizing vanadium loading to achieve highly dispersed species
3. Studying the effects of support properties on catalyst behavior

Key variables influencing vanadium species include:

1. Support type and composition (e.g. SiO2 content in Al2O3-SiO2 supports)
2. Surface area of the support
3. Vanadium loading - aiming for sub-monolayer coverage
4. Surface density of vanadium - affecting the degree of polymerization

These factors impact the dispersion, polymerization state, and catalytic properties of the supported vanadium oxide species.
