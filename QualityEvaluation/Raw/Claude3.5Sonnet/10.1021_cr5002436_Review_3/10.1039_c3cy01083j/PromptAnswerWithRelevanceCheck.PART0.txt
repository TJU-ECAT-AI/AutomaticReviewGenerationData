[1] "Recently, we have demonstrated that the VOx/MCM-41 catalyst with highly dispersed, near to isolated VOx species showed similar selectivity and, most importantly, stable catalytic performance in several DH/regeneration cycles surpassing in quality the industrially relevant CrOx/MCM-41 and PtSn/Al2O3."

[2] "The aim of the current work was to further explore the potential of VOx-based catalysts for the DH reaction. To this end, we selected commercial Al2O3SiO2 materials (Siral), pure Al2O3 and SiO2 as supports to prepare catalysts free of crystalline V2O5 particles."

[3] "As the surface density of V increases, the red shift of the CT onset occurs for VOx/Al2O3 and VOx/Siral (Fig. 1) due to the appearance of polymerized VO4 entities linked via oxygen bridges."

[4] "Al2O3, SiO2(MCM-41), and Al2O3SiO2 (Siral) with a SiO2 content varying from 1 to 70 wt.% were used to prepare supported catalysts with a V loading below one monolayer."

[5] "The content of SiO2 (0 to 100 wt.%) in the studied Al2O3SiO2 supports was demonstrated to have a strong effect on the activity and particularly the on-stream stability of the supported VOx species in propane DH."

Vanadium oxide-based catalysts have been explored as alternatives to Pt and CrOx for paraffin dehydrogenation due to their demonstrated stable catalytic performance and selectivity in dehydrogenation/regeneration cycles, surpassing the industrially relevant CrOx/MCM-41 and PtSn/Al2O3 catalysts. 

Research in this area has evolved to focus on exploring different support materials, such as commercial Al2O3-SiO2 (Siral), pure Al2O3, and SiO2, to prepare catalysts free of crystalline V2O5 particles. The goal has been to optimize the potential of VOx-based catalysts for dehydrogenation reactions.

Variables influencing the nature and behavior of vanadium species in these catalysts include:

1. Carrier type: Different supports like Al2O3, SiO2 (MCM-41), and Al2O3-SiO2 (Siral) with varying SiO2 content have been studied.

2. Support surface area: This affects the dispersion of VOx species.

3. Metal loading: Catalysts were prepared with V loading below one monolayer to avoid crystalline V2O5 formation.

4. SiO2 content: The amount of SiO2 (0 to 100 wt%) in Al2O3-SiO2 supports strongly affects the activity and on-stream stability of supported VOx species.

5. Surface density of V: As it increases, polymerized VO4 entities linked via oxygen bridges appear, affecting the catalytic properties.

These variables collectively influence the dispersion, structure, and stability of vanadium species, which in turn impact the catalyst's performance in paraffin dehydrogenation reactions.

Vanadium oxide-based catalysts have been explored as alternatives to Pt and CrOx for paraffin dehydrogenation due to their stable catalytic performance and ability to surpass the industrially relevant CrOx/MCM-41 and PtSn/Al2O3 catalysts in quality. Research has evolved to focus on preparing catalysts free of crystalline V2O5 particles and exploring various supports such as Al2O3SiO2 materials (Siral), pure Al2O3, and SiO2.

The type of carrier significantly influences the nature and behavior of vanadium species. Catalysts based on Siral supports with 1-10 wt% SiO2 showed the highest spacetime yields, approaching those of industrially relevant PtSn/Al2O3. The support surface area and composition affect the dispersion and stability of VOx species, with highly dispersed, near-isolated VOx species on MCM-41 showing stable performance.

Metal loading is kept below one monolayer to maintain high dispersion. The vanadium content and support type influence the initial propane conversion, with VOx/S1, VOx/S10, and VOx/S40 showing similar high conversions, while VOx/S70 had the lowest conversion.

Overall, research has progressed towards optimizing the support composition, surface area, and metal loading to achieve high activity, selectivity, and stability in vanadium oxide-based catalysts for paraffin dehydrogenation.
