[1] "Recently, we have demonstrated that the VOx/MCM-41 catalyst with highly dispersed, near to isolated VOx species showed similar selectivity and, most importantly, stable catalytic performance in several DH/regeneration cycles surpassing in quality the industrially relevant CrOx/MCM-41 and PtSn/Al2O3."

[2] "The aim of the current work was to further explore the potential of VOx-based catalysts for the DH reaction. To this end, we selected commercial Al2O3SiO2 materials (Siral), pure Al2O3 and SiO2 as supports to prepare catalysts free of crystalline V2O5 particles."

[3] "As evident from the individual plots, VOx/S1, VOx/S10 and VOx/S40 had similar initial propane conversion around 30%. VOx/Al2O3 and VOx/MCM-41 were only slightly less active, while VOx/S70 showed the lowest conversion of about 18%."

[4] "The highest spacetime yields of 146 and 158 kgC3H6 h1 mcatalyst3 at a propane conversion of 30% were achieved over the catalysts based on the Siral supports with 10 and 1 wt.% of SiO2, respectively. These values approach the 212 kgC3H6 h1 mcatalyst3 measured on the industrially relevant PtSn/Al2O3 and are approximately two times higher than that delivered by the VOx/MCM-41 catalyst with a similar vanadium loading."

Vanadium oxide-based catalysts have been explored as alternatives to Pt and CrOx for paraffin dehydrogenation due to their stable catalytic performance and ability to surpass the industrially relevant CrOx/MCM-41 and PtSn/Al2O3 catalysts in quality. Research has evolved to focus on preparing catalysts free of crystalline V2O5 particles and exploring various supports such as Al2O3SiO2 materials (Siral), pure Al2O3, and SiO2.

The type of carrier significantly influences the nature and behavior of vanadium species. Catalysts based on Siral supports with 1-10 wt% SiO2 showed the highest spacetime yields, approaching those of industrially relevant PtSn/Al2O3. The support surface area and composition affect the dispersion and stability of VOx species, with highly dispersed, near-isolated VOx species on MCM-41 showing stable performance.

Metal loading is kept below one monolayer to maintain high dispersion. The vanadium content and support type influence the initial propane conversion, with VOx/S1, VOx/S10, and VOx/S40 showing similar high conversions, while VOx/S70 had the lowest conversion.

Overall, research has progressed towards optimizing the support composition, surface area, and metal loading to achieve high activity, selectivity, and stability in vanadium oxide-based catalysts for paraffin dehydrogenation.

钒氧化物基催化剂被探索作为铂和铬氧化物在烷烃脱氢中的替代品，因为它们具有稳定的催化性能，并且能够在质量上超过工业相关的CrOx/MCM-41和PtSn/Al2O3催化剂。研究已经发展到集中于制备不含晶态V2O5颗粒的催化剂，并探索各种载体，如Al2O3SiO2材料（Siral）、纯Al2O3和SiO2。

载体类型显著影响钒物种的性质和行为。基于含1-10 wt% SiO2的Siral载体的催化剂显示出最高的时空产率，接近工业相关的PtSn/Al2O3。载体的表面积和成分影响VOx物种的分散性和稳定性，在MCM-41上高度分散的、接近孤立的VOx物种表现出稳定的性能。

金属负载保持在一个单层以下以维持高分散性。钒含量和载体类型影响初始丙烷转化率，VOx/S1、VOx/S10和VOx/S40显示出相似的高转化率，而VOx/S70的转化率最低。

总的来说，研究已经朝着优化载体成分、表面积和金属负载的方向发展，以在烷烃脱氢反应中实现钒氧化物基催化剂的高活性、高选择性和高稳定性。
