[1] "Recently, we have demonstrated that the VOx/MCM-41 catalyst with highly dispersed, near to isolated VOx species showed similar selectivity and, most importantly, stable catalytic performance in several DH/regeneration cycles surpassing in quality the industrially relevant CrOx/MCM-41 and PtSn/Al2O3."

[2] "The aim of the current work was to further explore the potential of VOx-based catalysts for the DH reaction. To this end, we selected commercial Al2O3SiO2 materials (Siral), pure Al2O3 and SiO2 as supports to prepare catalysts free of crystalline V2O5 particles."

[3] "Al2O3, SiO2(MCM-41), and Al2O3SiO2 (Siral) with a SiO2 content varying from 1 to 70 wt.% were used to prepare supported catalysts with a V loading below one monolayer."

[4] "The highest spacetime yield of propene was only 25% lower than that over industrially relevant PtSn/Al2O3 under the same reaction conditions."

[5] "Acidic properties of the support were found to be crucial for the generation of such catalytically active carbon species."

Factors driving exploration of vanadium oxide-based catalysts for paraffin dehydrogenation include:

1. Potential for high selectivity and stable performance over multiple dehydrogenation/regeneration cycles, surpassing industrial CrOx and PtSn catalysts. 

2. Ability to achieve high propene yields approaching those of PtSn/Al2O3 catalysts.

3. Flexibility in tailoring catalyst properties by varying support composition and surface area.

Research has evolved to focus on:

1. Optimizing support materials, exploring Al2O3, SiO2, and mixed Al2O3-SiO2 supports with varying silica content.

2. Controlling vanadium loading to achieve highly dispersed species below monolayer coverage.

3. Understanding the role of support acidity in carbon formation and catalyst behavior.

4. Investigating the nature and catalytic activity of carbon deposits formed during reaction.

Key variables influencing vanadium species include:

1. Support type and composition (Al2O3, SiO2, Al2O3-SiO2 ratio)
2. Support surface area 
3. Vanadium loading (kept below monolayer coverage)
4. Support acidity

These factors affect the dispersion, stability, and catalytic performance of vanadium oxide species, as well as carbon formation during reaction.
