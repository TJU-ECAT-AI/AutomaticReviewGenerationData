Effect of support on selectivity and on-stream
stability of surface VOx species in non-oxidative
propane dehydrogenation
S. Sokolov, M. Stoyanova, U. Rodemerck, D. Linke and E. V. Kondratenko*
Al2O3, SiO2(MCM-41), and Al2O3SiO2 (Siral) with a SiO2 content varying from 1 to 70 wt.% were used
to prepare supported catalysts with a V loading below one monolayer. Their activity, selectivity and
on-stream stability were tested in non-oxidative propane dehydrogenation (DH) at 550 C. The highest
spacetime yield of propene was only 25% lower than that over industrially relevant PtSn/Al2O3 under
the same reaction conditions. All catalysts deactivated with time on stream, but restored their initial
performance after oxidative regeneration as proven in a sequence of 10 DH/regeneration cycles lasting in
total over 60 h. The deactivation was related to propene-derived carbon deposits covering active VOx
sites. However, depending on the catalyst, such deposits formed on bare support sites can also participate
in propane dehydrogenation. Their DH activity is, however, significantly lower compared to VOx species.
Acidic properties of the support were found to be crucial for the generation of such catalytically active
carbon species.
Introduction
Propene is the second most important petrochemical after
ethylene with an annual production of around 79 million
metric tons in 2011.1 Its demand has been steadily growing
for the past twenty years thanks to rising production of
various polymers. Today, propene is mostly produced as a
by-product of the steam cracking of naphtha and liquid
petroleum gas or fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) of heavy frac-
tions of crude oils. Since the existing production capacities
cannot completely fulfil the propene demand, two alternative
processes were commercialized: non-oxidative propane dehy-
drogenation (DH)2 and metathesis of ethylene and 2-butene.3
The former becomes increasingly important given the avail-
ability of low cost propane from shale gas and co-production
of hydrogen. Moreover, the dehydrogenation route is inde-
pendent of the state of steam crackers or FCC plants, unlike
the metathesis process.
There are five commercial DH technologies differing in the
reactor type, mode of operation and catalysts.2 As far as the
catalysts are concerned, CATOFIN (licensed to LummusHoudry)
and FBD-3 (SnamprogettiYarsintez) utilize the chromia
alumina catalyst, while alumina-supported Pt catalysts are
used in Oleflex (UOP), PDH (LindeBASFStatoil), and STAR
(Krupp Uhde) processes. Irrespective of the process, DH activity
of the applied catalysts drops with time on stream due to
the blockage of active sites by the formed coke.4 As a conse-
quence, catalysts must be oxidatively regenerated to restore
their activity. However, this treatment results in a gradual
loss of initial activity and reduction of the on-stream stability
in successive DH cycles owing to the restructuring of the
catalytically active Pt or CrOx species.5 Recently, we have
demonstrated that the VOx/MCM-41 catalyst with highly
dispersed, near to isolated VOx species showed similar selec-
tivity and, most importantly, stable catalytic performance in
several DH/regeneration cycles surpassing in quality the
industrially relevant CrOx/MCM-41 and PtSn/Al2O3.6 This was
ascribed to the stability of VOx species against agglomeration
in the course of DH and regeneration cycles.
The aim of the current work was to further explore the
potential of VOx-based catalysts for the DH reaction. To this
end, we selected commercial Al2O3SiO2 materials (Siral),
pure Al2O3 and SiO2 as supports to prepare catalysts free

of crystalline V2O5 particles. In particular, we focused on
(i) elucidating factors governing catalyst on-stream stability,
(ii) analysing the role of pristine supports and carbon
deposits in propene production and (iii) optimizing reactor
operation to achieve industrially relevant propene production.
The catalysts' long-term stability was verified in ten optimized
DH/regeneration cycles with a total duration of ca. 60 h.
Experimental
Preparation of catalytic materials
Aluminosilicates (Siral 1, 10, 40 and 70) provided by Sasol,
pure Al2O3 (Saint-Gobain NorPro), and SiO2 (MCM-41) were
used as supports. Siral index stands for the weight percentage
of SiO2 in the material. MCM-41 was synthesized following
the procedure reported in ref. 7. Supported catalysts were pre-
pared according to the procedure described in ref. 8. Briefly,
3.33 g of vanadyl acetylacetonate (VO(acac)2, Sigma-Aldrich, 99%)
were stirred in 1 L dried toluene (Roth, >99.5%, less than
50 ppm H2O) for 3 h and the undissolved substance was
separated by filtration. 10 g of the support were added to the
filtered dark-blue solution and the mixture was stirred at room
temperature for 24 h during which the colour intensity visibly
faded. Hereafter, the impregnated support was isolated,
washed twice in 400500 mL of pure toluene to remove the
physically adsorbed metal precursor, dried at 80 C for 20 h
and calcined in a muffle furnace at 550 C for 12 h. To
increase the metal loading, the procedure was repeated on
each calcined material.
The Siral-based catalysts will be further abbreviated as
VOx/S1, VOx/S10, VOx/S40 and VOx/S70; VOx supported on
MCM-41 and Al2O3 are called VOx/MCM-41 and VOx/Al2O3,
respectively. Prior to the catalytic tests, the catalysts were
pelleted, crushed and sieved into 315710 μm fraction.
Catalyst characterisation
The specific surface areas of the calcined catalysts (Table 1)
were calculated from N2 adsorptiondesorption isotherms
collected at 77 K on a BELSORP-mini II (BEL Japan). The
Brunauer, Emmett and Teller (BET) equation was applied for
a N2 relative pressure range of 0.05 < P/P0 < 0.30.
The metal content of the calcined catalysts (Table 1) was
determined by inductively coupled plasma optical emission
spectroscopy (ICP-OES, Varian 715-ES).
The surface acidity of the pristine supports was evaluated
via infrared (IR) measurements of adsorbed pyridine using a
Tensor 27 spectrometer (Bruker). The instrument was equipped
with an in-house developed cell with CaF2 windows connected
to a gas dosing system. The powders were pressed into
self-supporting wafers (50 mg, 20 mm in diameter). Before
pyridine adsorption, the samples were pretreated at 309 C
for 10 min in synthetic air followed by cooling to room tem-
perature and evacuation. Pyridine was adsorbed at 25 C until
saturation was reached. Then, the reaction cell was evacuated
to remove physisorbed pyridine. After heating the sample in
vacuum to 150 C, the IR spectra of the adsorbed pyridine
were recorded.

3.8 mm inner diameter. All catalytic experiments were carried
out at a gas hourly space velocity (GHSV) of 1200 L h1 kg1
and an overall pressure of 1.2 bar. Each reactor was filled
with 300 mg of fresh catalyst. The catalysts were initially
heated in parallel at 5 K min1 to 550 C in air (10 mL min1
per reactor), held in air flow for 1 h and then flushed with N2
for 20 min. Hereafter, a mixture of 40 vol.% C3H8 in N2 was
fed at a rate of 6 mL min1 per reactor. The experiment was
run for either 6 or 27 h followed by cooling the reactors to
room temperature in N2. For the experiment with reductive
catalyst pre-treatment, after heating the catalysts in air up to
550 C they were flushed with N2 for 20 min and then treated
in a mixture of 30 vol.% H2 in N2 passed at 6 mL min1 for
1 h. Before C3H8 was admitted, the reduced catalysts were
flushed again for 20 min with N2 at 550 C.

conditions in the same 15-channel reactor. The 6 h DH stages
were followed by 2 h oxidative regeneration also performed at
550 C in a flow of O2 (20 vol.%) in N2. DH and regeneration
stages were always interlaid by flushing with N2 (10 mL min1
per reactor) lasting for 20 min. After the last DH cycle, the
catalysts were cooled to room temperature in N2.
The feed components and the reaction products were
analysed using an on-line gas chromatograph (Agilent 6890)
equipped with PLOT/Q (for CO2), HP-PLOT Al2O3 KCl
(for hydrocarbons) and Molsieve 5 (for H2, O2, N2, and CO)
columns and flame ionization and thermal conductivity
detectors. The GC analyses were carried out successively, i.e.
reactor by reactor. The propane conversion was calculated
from the inlet and outlet propane molar flows (eqn (1)). The
propene yield and selectivity to propene and to carbon were
calculated according to eqn (2), (3) and (4), respectively:

In situ UV/Vis studies
The experiment designed to monitor the state of VOx species
and carbon accumulation under DH conditions was carried
out in an in-house developed catalytic set-up enabling in situ
UV/Vis catalyst characterization with simultaneous analysis of
gas-phase components using an on-line gas-chromatograph
(Agilent 7890).9 150 mg of fresh VOx/MCM-41, VOx/S10 and
VOx/S40 were loaded and heated at 5 K min1 to 550 C in
20 vol.% O2 in Ne flow (7 mL min1 per reactor), held at
550 C for 1 h and flushed with Ne for 20 min. Hereafter,
a mixture of 40 vol.% C3H8 in Ne was fed at a flow rate of
3 mL min1 per reactor (GHSV 1200 L h1 kg1) for 5.5 h
followed by cooling the catalyst to room temperature in
Ne flow. UV/Vis spectra were recorded every 5 min.
The spectra were collected using an AVASPEC UV/Vis spec-
trometer (Avantes) equipped with a DH-2000 deuterium-halogen
light source and a CCD array detector. BaSO4 was used as a
white reference material. High-temperature reflection UV/Vis
probes consisting of 6 radiating optical fibres and 1 reading
fibre were threaded through the furnace wall to face quartz
reactors.9 All spectra are presented as the KubelkaMunk
function F(R) calculated according to eqn (5):

where R is the reflectance.
Quantification of carbon deposits
The amount of carbon deposits formed during a DH cycle
was determined from the amounts of CO and CO2 evolved
during temperature-programmed oxidation (TPO) of the cata-
lysts used in the DH reaction run at 550 C for 6 or 27 h.
The TPO measurements were performed in a setup equipped
with eight individually heated plug-flow fixed-bed quartz tube
reactors of 6.9 mm inner diameter. The used catalysts were
heated to 900 C at 10 K min1 in a flow (10 mL min1) of
10 vol.% O2 in Ar. The measurements were performed succes-
sively, i.e. during heating (TPO) of the analysed sample, all
other samples were kept at 25 C under Ar. Oxygen consump-
tion and formation of the reaction products were monitored
using a quadrupole mass spectrometer (Pfeiffer Vacuum
OmniStar 200). The following atomic mass units (AMUs)
were obtained: 44 (CO2), 40 (Ar), 32 (O2), 28 (CO, CO2), and
18 (H2O). The concentrations of O2, CO and CO2 were deter-
mined from the respective AMUs using standard fragmenta-
tion patterns and sensitivity factors determined by analysing
calibration gas mixtures.
Results
Characterisation of catalytic materials
Catalytic materials used in this study and their selected phys-
icochemical characteristics are presented in Table 1. The spe-
cific surface areas (SBET) of the calcined catalysts were lower
than those of the corresponding pristine supports with the
highest loss of 26% observed on VOx/S40 and VOx/S70. The
distribution of VOx species on the surface of the freshly cal-
cined catalysts was studied by UV/Vis spectroscopy. The UV/Vis
spectra of the catalysts at 550 C in a flow of O2 (20 vol.%) in
N2 are shown in Fig. 1. The spectrum of VOx/MCM-41 is domi-
nated by the charge transfer (CT) transition from O2to V5+
with a broad absorption band at ca. 300 nm characteristic of
highly-dispersed dehydrated VO4 surface species.8,10 As the
surface density of V increases, the red shift of the CT onset
occurs for VOx/Al2O3 and VOx/Siral (Fig. 1) due to the appear-
ance of polymerized VO4 entities linked via oxygen bridges.10
Catalytic performance
In order to gain insights into the catalysts' activity, selectivity
and on-stream stability, we initially performed a 27 h DH test
at 550 C. Fig. 2 shows propane conversion and selectivity to
propene and to carbon as a function of time on stream.
Other gas-phase side products were methane, ethylene and
ethane. As evident from the individual plots, VOx/S1, VOx/S10

and VOx/S40 had similar initial propane conversion around
30%. VOx/Al2O3 and VOx/MCM-41 were only slightly less
active, while VOx/S70 showed the lowest conversion of about
18%. The latter catalyst was the second most stable in terms
of sustaining X(C3H8), while VOx/Al2O3 and VOx/MCM-41
demonstrated the worst and the best stability, respectively.
Among other catalysts, VOx/S10 showed higher stability in
the first 34 h on stream and remained slightly more active
through the rest of the experiment.
With time on stream, an increase in selectivity to propene
concomitant with a decrease in propane conversion took
place over VOx/S1, VOx/S10, VOx/S40, and, to a lower extent,
over VOx/Al2O3. Such selectivity trends arise from the fact
that the side products, including carbon, are formed from
propene, the concentration of which drops with time on
stream. Consecutively, carbon selectivity over these catalysts
decreased to zero after 1220 h on stream. On the other
hand, the on-stream selectivity to propene practically did not
change over VOx/MCM-41 and VOx/S70, remaining through
the entire run in the 8890% and 9394% range, respectively.
The corresponding carbon selectivity was in the range of
13% and 25% being the lowest among all catalysts when
compared at similar degrees of propane conversion. Further
insight into coke formation and its role in the DH reaction is
given in the sections Analysis of formation and removal of
carbon deposits and Discussion.
In the next step, long-term stability of the catalysts was
studied in a series of 10 successive cycles comprising a DH
stage followed by an oxidative regeneration stage. The dura-
tion of each DH cycle was fixed to 6 h because during this
period of time no dramatic losses in propane conversion and
propene yield were observed over all catalysts with the excep-
tion of VOx/Al2O3 (Fig. 2 and S1 in the ESI). Fig. 3 and S2
show time on stream propene yield and propane conversion
obtained in the first three and last two DH cycles (others are
omitted for the purpose of clarity). By integrating the yield
profiles, we calculated the amount of propene formed over
each catalyst in different cycles. The results are summarized
in Fig. 4. Among the VOx-based catalysts, VOx/S70 exhibited
the strongest loss of 25% in propene production over 10 DH
cycles, while VOx/S10 had identical catalytic performance from
cycle to cycle. All other catalysts lost some of their activity in
the first 78 cycles and remained at the same level in the last
23 cycles. VOx/S10 produced the highest amount of propene

in each DH cycle among the catalysts prepared in this study,
but less than that of reduced PtSn/Al2O3 tested in our previous
work.6 However, the Pt-based catalyst lost its X(C3H8) from
cycle to cycle whereas VOx/S10 showed stable performance.
Another important observation derived from Fig. 3 is the
presence of a maximum in the time on stream profiles of
propene yield obtained over all catalysts based on mixed
Al2O3SiO2 supports. These maxima could not be detected
in the 27 h test since the time intervals between the GC
measurements were longer than in the 6 h stages (2 h 15 min
vs. 50 min). Measurements at yet higher periodicity (27 min)
did not reveal such a maximum for VOx/MCM-41 (Fig. S3). Such
maxima are present in all cycles thus indicating a reversibility
of the process(es) responsible for their appearance. Paralleling
the trend observed for the yield curves, their propane conver-
sion curves also contain maxima (Fig. S2). Such maxima
indicate that i) the activity of supported VOx species increased
with time on stream or ii) some other active species were
additionally formed under DH conditions. The difference
in catalytic behaviour reflected in the catalysts' activity and
on-stream stability as well as the origin of the maxima in their
Y(C3H6) and X(C3H8) profiles are thoroughly treated in the
Discussion section together with the catalytic and character-
isation results.
Analysis of formation and removal of carbon deposits
To quantify carbon deposits formed during the DH reaction,
we performed TPO of spent catalysts after the 27 h experi-
ment and after the 10th cycle of the 6 h test. The amounts of
carbon formed in the corresponding DH tests were deter-
mined by integrating the CO and CO2 profiles recorded in
the TPO tests and are given in Table 1. Relative to the total
amount of carbon deposited on the catalyst during the 27 h
test, VOx/S70 accumulated 44% (lowest) and VOx/Al2O3 89%
(highest) during the 6 h run. Taking these data into account, it
can be concluded that the rate of carbon deposition decreases
with increasing time on stream, which is in accordance with
the S(C) shown for all catalysts in Fig. 2. Irrespective of the
DH test duration, carbon deposition was intense on the cata-
lysts showing high propene yield (VOx/S1, VOx/S10, VOx/S40)
thus supporting the hypothesis that propene serves as a pre-
cursor of deposited carbonaceous species.
For all catalysts, the temperatures of maximal CO2 evolu-
tion (Tmax) in the TPO tests after the 6 h run are lower than
those after the 27 h run (Table 1). This suggests that the
degree of carbon condensation increases with time on stream.
The CO2 profiles of VOx/MCM-41 after the 6 and 27 h tests
had the lowest Tmax at 380 and 405 C, respectively. The
second lowest corresponding Tmax of 425 and 440 C were
determined on VOx/Al2O3. For the Siral-based catalysts, the Tmax
values were higher and reached the maximum on VOx/S40
(Table 1). In addition, two and three distinguishable Tmax
were observed in the CO2 profiles of VOx/S1 and VOx/S40,
respectively, after the 6 h test. Thus, our TPO tests suggest
that the support and the duration of the DH run influence the
degree of condensation of carbon deposits.
Further insight into the nature of carbon species and the
rate of their formation was derived from the in situ UV/Vis
characterization
of
VOx/MCM-41,
VOx/S40
and
VOx/S10.
Upper panels in Fig. 5 display the UV/Vis spectra of these
catalysts in their fresh (fully oxidized) state and after 0.5 and
5 h on stream. After 0.5 h on stream, the spectra of each cata-
lyst conformed to a unique shape that persisted through the
rest of the experiment. For VOx/MCM-41, the KubelkaMunk
function
(F(R))
exhibited
monotonous
growth
with
an
increasing wavelength, while in the case of VOx/S10 it showed
a maximum at ca. 425 nm and then descended. The spectra
of VOx/S40 appeared to be a combination of the above two.
Their complex nature is in agreement with the multiple Tmax
featured by the TPO profile of the same catalyst after 6 h
on stream.

The lower panels in Fig. 5 show temporal evolution of F(R)
at 700 nm recorded in four consecutive 6 h DH cycles. This
wavelength was selected since it falls into the 570800 nm
range characteristic for polyaromatic graphitic species.11 For
VOx/MCM-41 and VOx/S10, F(R) continuously increases with
time on stream, while for VOx/S40 it reaches a plateau after
2 h. Flattening of the signal on the latter catalyst is related to
a decrease in the rate of carbon deposition. This statement is
in good agreement with the results of TPO tests; the amount
of carbon deposited over VOx/S40 after 6 h on DH stream cor-
responds to 86% of total carbon formed after 27 h, while the
corresponding values for VOx/MCM-41 and VOx/S10 are 45
and 47%, respectively. Comparing the slopes of the F(R)
growth and the time to attain a plateau, we put forward that
the rate of carbon deposition follows this order: VOx/MCM-41 <
VOx/S10 < VOx/S40.
Discussion
In the present study, we have demonstrated the importance
of SiO2 content in SiO2Al2O3 supports for activity, selectivity
and on-stream stability of supported VOx species in non-
oxidative propane DH (Fig. 2 and 3). It is worth mentioning
that dispersed VOx species on low-silica aluminosilicates afford
the industrially attractive spacetime yield (STY) of propene,
which is a crucial process characteristic. Fig. 6 shows the maxi-
mal and the average STY values of all catalysts prepared in the
current study and of reduced PtSn/Al2O3 used in our previous
work as the industrially relevant catalyst.6
The highest STY was measured on VOx/S1 and VOx/S10 and
comprised, respectively, 75 and 65% of 212 kgC3H6 h1 mcatalyst
3
achieved on PtSn/Al2O3. The reason behind the lower STY
obtained on VOx/S10 compared to that on VOx/S1 is merely
the lower catalyst powder density of the former stemming
from a higher SiO2 content.
Besides the effect on propene productivity, the supports
with different Al2O3/SiO2 ratios also exerted a strong influ-
ence on the on-stream behaviour of the supported catalysts.
The following discussion is aimed to elucidate the funda-
mental origins of this influence. As shown in Fig. 3 and S2,
Y(C3H6) and X(C3H8) profiles of all catalysts based on
Al2O3SiO2 supports are characterized by maxima appearing
after the first 23 h on-stream, with those of VOx/S1 and
VOx/S10 being the most pronounced. Such temporal behaviour
indicates that the catalysts initially improved their activity
and then continuously lost it. The origins of this activating
phenomenon may be: (i) the higher catalytic activity of the
reduced VOx species that were formed at the beginning of the
DH stage or (ii) participation of carbon species formed on bare
supports in DH. In situ reduction of V5+ under DH conditions

has been previously reported in the literature6,12 and was also
verified in this work by detecting COx in the products at the
beginning of the DH reaction over initially oxidized catalysts,
while their pre-reduced counterparts did not form carbon
oxides (Fig. S4) However, taking into account much greater
amounts of hydrogen produced alongside with COx (Fig. S4),
the contribution of oxidative propane dehydrogenation by a
lattice oxygen of VOx to propene formation is deemed low
compared to that of the non-oxidative DH route. Nevertheless,
the hypothesis which holds that reduced VOx species are more
active than oxidized ones can be excluded since pre-reduced
VOx/S1 and VOx/S10 showed lower initial propane conversion
than their oxidized counterparts (Fig. S5) with the difference
vanishing with time on stream. In addition, propane conver-
sion over both reduced and oxidized catalysts passed over a
maximum in the first 3 h on stream.
It is worth reiterating that carbon deposits are formed
over all catalysts from the beginning of a DH run as
evidenced by non-zero coke selectivity in Fig. 2 and by
on-stream changes in the UV/Vis spectra of the catalysts in
Fig. 5. However, some tested catalysts lost their activity con-
tinuously, while the others activated within the first hours on
stream. This variance leads us to propose that if carbon
deposits contributed to propane dehydrogenation at all, their
contribution would depend on the catalysts where they are
formed. The role of carbon deposits is explored in Fig. 7,
where propane conversion obtained directly after starting
the reaction (no coke on the catalyst surface) as well as
after 6 and 27 h on stream, is plotted versus the amount of
carbon formed after these times. For VOx/Al2O3, VOx/S70 and
VOx/MCM-41, the plots reveal a clear decrease in the conver-
sion with rising amount of deposits, i.e. formation of carbon
is the reason for activity loss. The other catalysts based on
Al2O3SiO2 supports show a complex dependence of propane
conversion on the amount of deposited carbon. For instance,
the conversion of propane over VOx/S1 and VOx/S10 after 6 h
on stream was very close to the initial one, despite the
fact that they deposited a higher amount of carbon than
VOx/Al2O3 and VOx/MCM-41 even after 27 h. The highest
amount of carbon after 6 h on stream was formed over
VOx/S40, which, however, exhibited more stable performance
than the two latter catalysts but deactivated faster than VOx/S1
and VOx/S10. On the other hand, VOx/S1, VOx/S10 and VOx/S40,
being the most stable in the 6 h test, showed significantly lower
propane conversion after 27 h on stream than VOx/MCM-41.
They also deposited the highest amount of carbon.
Based on the above considerations, it can be concluded
that deactivation of all catalysts tested in the current work
should be related to coke deposition, which is in agreement
with several previous studies on propane dehydrogenation
over supported catalysts having Pt,13,14 CrOx
11,1517 or VOx
6 as
the catalytically active phase. However, coke can also play a
positive role as suggested by Weckhuysen and co-workers,
who attributed the initial increase in propane conversion over

CrOx/Al2O3 to participation of carbon species in dehydrogena-
tion.11,18,19 The authors assumed that such species deposited
in the vicinity of CrOx sites favour propane adsorption, while
dehydrogenation of adsorbed propane takes place over CrOx
species. Yet, if this hypothesis was of a general character and
equally applicable to VOx catalysts, what would be the reason
for the catalyst effect on the time on-stream profiles of
propene yield (Fig. 3) and propane conversion (Fig. S2)
observed in our study? Searching for an answer, we performed
propane DH over the pristine supports under the same condi-
tions as for their VOx-containing counterparts. The initial
propene yield on all supports was below 1% (Fig. 8) and very
close to the value observed in a reactor filled with catalytically
inert silicon carbide (dashed line in the same figure). First,
it should be stressed that such a low yield should be viewed
as further evidence of the importance of VOx species for
achieving high propene productivity. Siral 70 and MCM-41
retained low activity for the entire 27 h test, while propene
yield over Al2O3, Siral 1, Siral 10 and Siral 40 increased with
time on stream approaching 5% over Siral 1 by the end of the
experiment. Such an increase suggests that DH active species
were formed in situ under reaction conditions.
To check if carbon was also formed during the DH reac-
tion over the pristine supports, we examined all used sup-
ports by TPO. Trace amounts of carbon were deposited on
MCM-41 and Siral 70. Other supports ordered according to
the amount of carbon formed as Siral 1 > Siral 10  Al2O3 >
Siral 40 (Table 1). Compared to the supports, the respective
VOx-containing catalysts deposited significantly greater amount
of carbon species. This is due to the higher propene partial
pressure caused by the significantly higher DH activity of
VOx species, and propene is known to be a precursor of
coke.5,14,18,20,21 In addition, the catalysts possess acidic VOx
species, which adsorb propene, too. In the case of VOx/MCM-41,
propene adsorption takes place exclusively on such sites because
pristine MCM-41 is inert for carbon formation (Table 1).
Importantly, the supports that deposited carbon demon-
strated an increase in propane conversion with time on
stream, and the higher was the amount of carbon deposits,
the higher propene yield was achieved (Fig. 9). Moreover,
Al2O3 reached stable activity with a propene yield of 2.5%
after 15 h on stream. This value is actually very close to
that measured over VOx/Al2O3 after 27 h on stream (Fig. 2).
For the VOx/Al2O3 catalyst, it can be hypothesised that after
27 h on stream all VOx sites are blocked by carbon deposits
and only the coke sites are still active in dehydrogenation
thus giving a similar propane conversion as over the coked
pristine Al2O3. The plateau was reached on Al2O3 earlier than
on other supports because it had the lowest surface area. Thus,
compared to propane dehydrogenation over CrOx/Al2O3,11 we
suggest that carbon deposits participate in propane dehydro-
genation over V-based catalysts. This hypothesis is supported
by the fact that propene yield increases with the amount of
carbon species formed over the pristine supports (Fig. 9).
Based on the fact that the pristine supports develop DH
activity with time on stream (Fig. 8), we explain the increase
in propene yield and propane conversion within the first 3 h
on stream over VOx/Siral (Fig. 3 and S2) by the formation of
carbon species from propene, which actively participate in
propane DH. This statement is indirectly supported by the
fact that the best performing VOx/S1 and VOx/S10 catalysts
showed the lowest initial propene production at the highest
carbon selectivity (Fig. 2). Owing to the low surface density of
VOx species, it is suggested that carbon deposits are initially
formed on support sites. Thus, the overall number of catalyti-
cally active sites increases resulting in an increase in propene
production. As the reaction progresses, more intrinsically active
VOx species become blocked by carbon deposits resulting in a
drop in the overall catalytic activity. The presence and duration
of the activation phase should depend on the acidic properties

of the support and its available free surface area. The catalyst
acidity favours propene adsorption22 followed by its oligomerisation
and finally formation of carbonaceous deposits.5,14,18,20,21
To compare the pristine supports in terms of their acidity,
we studied pyridine adsorption by IR spectroscopy. As shown
in Table 1, Al2O3 possesses the highest surface total acidity
(Lewis and Brnsted), while no acidic sites were identified on
MCM-41. When the amount of carbon deposited per area of
the pristine support is plotted versus the acidity values as
shown in Fig. 10, the promoting effect of surface acidity on
carbon formation becomes evident. Since non-acidic MCM-41
formed virtually no carbon on its surface, coke formation on
VOx/MCM-41 must have started directly on the acidic VOx
species thus blocking the DH active sites. As a consequence,
we observe no maximum in catalytic activity but rather deac-
tivation occurring from the beginning of the catalytic run.
This assumption is supported by the fact that the carbon
deposits formed on VOx/MCM-41 strongly differ from those
formed on the activating catalysts when compared in terms
of their Tmax of CO2 evolution (Table 1).
In summary, in order to profit from the dehydrogenating
activity of in situ formed carbon species, catalytic materials
must possess the largest possible surface area and an optimal
ratio of the support acidic sites to VOx species. The coverage
with such species must be definitely lower than a monolayer.
Moreover, the duration of a DH cycle must be also optimized.
Conclusions
The content of SiO2 (0 to 100 wt.%) in the studied Al2O3SiO2
supports was demonstrated to have a strong effect on the activity
and particularly the on-stream stability of the supported VOx
species in propane DH. The highest spacetime yields of 146
and 158 kgC3H6 h1 mcatalyst
3 at a propane conversion of 30%
were achieved over the catalysts based on the Siral supports
with 10 and 1 wt.% of SiO2, respectively. These values approach
the 212 kgC3H6 h1 mcatalyst
3 measured on the industrially
relevant PtSn/Al2O3 and are approximately two times higher
than that delivered by the VOx/MCM-41 catalyst with a similar
vanadium loading.
With the exception of the catalyst containing 70 wt.%
of SiO2 in the support, all other catalysts showed excellent
ability to restore their initial activity as proven in a series of
10 DH/oxidative regeneration cycles. The optimal duration of
the DH cycle without a significant loss of initial propene yield
over Siral-based catalysts was determined to be 6 h. This
was explained by the fact that carbon deposits are initially
formed on the support sites not carrying VOx and that such
deposits are active in propane dehydrogenation. Since their
activity is significantly lower than that of VOx species, the
catalysts start to deactivate when the latter also become
covered by coke. The tendency of the catalysts to form coke
increases with their surface acidity.
