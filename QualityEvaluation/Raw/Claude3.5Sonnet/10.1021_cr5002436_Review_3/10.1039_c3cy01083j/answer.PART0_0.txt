[1] "Recently, we have demonstrated that the VOx/MCM-41 catalyst with highly dispersed, near to isolated VOx species showed similar selectivity and, most importantly, stable catalytic performance in several DH/regeneration cycles surpassing in quality the industrially relevant CrOx/MCM-41 and PtSn/Al2O3."

[2] "The aim of the current work was to further explore the potential of VOx-based catalysts for the DH reaction. To this end, we selected commercial Al2O3SiO2 materials (Siral), pure Al2O3 and SiO2 as supports to prepare catalysts free of crystalline V2O5 particles."

[3] "As the surface density of V increases, the red shift of the CT onset occurs for VOx/Al2O3 and VOx/Siral (Fig. 1) due to the appearance of polymerized VO4 entities linked via oxygen bridges."

[4] "Al2O3, SiO2(MCM-41), and Al2O3SiO2 (Siral) with a SiO2 content varying from 1 to 70 wt.% were used to prepare supported catalysts with a V loading below one monolayer."

[5] "The content of SiO2 (0 to 100 wt.%) in the studied Al2O3SiO2 supports was demonstrated to have a strong effect on the activity and particularly the on-stream stability of the supported VOx species in propane DH."

Vanadium oxide-based catalysts have been explored as alternatives to Pt and CrOx for paraffin dehydrogenation due to their demonstrated stable catalytic performance and selectivity in dehydrogenation/regeneration cycles, surpassing the industrially relevant CrOx/MCM-41 and PtSn/Al2O3 catalysts. 

Research in this area has evolved to focus on exploring different support materials, such as commercial Al2O3-SiO2 (Siral), pure Al2O3, and SiO2, to prepare catalysts free of crystalline V2O5 particles. The goal has been to optimize the potential of VOx-based catalysts for dehydrogenation reactions.

Variables influencing the nature and behavior of vanadium species in these catalysts include:

1. Carrier type: Different supports like Al2O3, SiO2 (MCM-41), and Al2O3-SiO2 (Siral) with varying SiO2 content have been studied.

2. Support surface area: This affects the dispersion of VOx species.

3. Metal loading: Catalysts were prepared with V loading below one monolayer to avoid crystalline V2O5 formation.

4. SiO2 content: The amount of SiO2 (0 to 100 wt%) in Al2O3-SiO2 supports strongly affects the activity and on-stream stability of supported VOx species.

5. Surface density of V: As it increases, polymerized VO4 entities linked via oxygen bridges appear, affecting the catalytic properties.

These variables collectively influence the dispersion, structure, and stability of vanadium species, which in turn impact the catalyst's performance in paraffin dehydrogenation reactions.

钒氧化物基催化剂被研究作为烷烃脱氢反应中铂和氧化铬催化剂的替代品，这是因为它们在脱氢/再生循环中表现出稳定的催化性能和选择性，超过了工业相关的CrOx/MCM-41和PtSn/Al2O3催化剂。

该领域的研究已经演变为关注探索不同的载体材料，如商业Al2O3-SiO2（Siral）、纯Al2O3和SiO2，以制备不含晶态V2O5颗粒的催化剂。目标是优化VOx基催化剂在脱氢反应中的潜力。

影响这些催化剂中钒物种性质和行为的变量包括：

1. 载体类型：研究了不同的载体，如Al2O3、SiO2（MCM-41）和具有不同SiO2含量的Al2O3-SiO2（Siral）。

2. 载体表面积：这影响VOx物种的分散度。

3. 金属负载量：制备了V负载量低于单层的催化剂，以避免形成晶态V2O5。

4. SiO2含量：Al2O3-SiO2载体中SiO2的含量（0至100 wt%）强烈影响支持的VOx物种的活性和在线稳定性。

5. V的表面密度：随着其增加，通过氧桥连接的聚合VO4实体出现，影响催化性能。

这些变量共同影响钒物种的分散度、结构和稳定性，进而影响催化剂在烷烃脱氢反应中的性能。
