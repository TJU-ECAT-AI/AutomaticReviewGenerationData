[1] "Recently, we have demonstrated that the VOx/MCM-41 catalyst with highly dispersed, near to isolated VOx species showed similar selectivity and, most importantly, stable catalytic performance in several DH/regeneration cycles surpassing in quality the industrially relevant CrOx/MCM-41 and PtSn/Al2O3."

[2] "The aim of the current work was to further explore the potential of VOx-based catalysts for the DH reaction. To this end, we selected commercial Al2O3SiO2 materials (Siral), pure Al2O3 and SiO2 as supports to prepare catalysts free of crystalline V2O5 particles."

[3] "Al2O3, SiO2(MCM-41), and Al2O3SiO2 (Siral) with a SiO2 content varying from 1 to 70 wt.% were used to prepare supported catalysts with a V loading below one monolayer."

[4] "The highest spacetime yield of propene was only 25% lower than that over industrially relevant PtSn/Al2O3 under the same reaction conditions."

[5] "Acidic properties of the support were found to be crucial for the generation of such catalytically active carbon species."

Vanadium oxide-based catalysts have been explored as alternatives to Pt and CrOx for paraffin dehydrogenation due to their promising performance and stability. Research in this area has evolved to focus on highly dispersed VOx species on various supports, particularly MCM-41 and Al2O3-SiO2 materials.

Key factors influencing the nature and behavior of vanadium species in these catalysts include:

1. Carrier type: Different supports like Al2O3, SiO2 (MCM-41), and Al2O3-SiO2 (Siral) have been investigated.

2. Support surface area: High surface area supports are preferred to achieve better dispersion of VOx species.

3. Metal loading: Catalysts are prepared with V loading below one monolayer to avoid crystalline V2O5 particles.

4. Support acidity: Acidic properties of the support play a crucial role in generating catalytically active carbon species.

These variables affect the dispersion, stability, and catalytic performance of VOx species. Recent research has shown that VOx-based catalysts can achieve propene yields comparable to industrially relevant PtSn/Al2O3 catalysts, with improved stability over multiple dehydrogenation/regeneration cycles.

钒氧化物基催化剂作为烷烃脱氢反应中铂和铬氧化物催化剂的替代品被广泛研究，原因是它们具有良好的性能和稳定性。这一领域的研究已经演变为专注于各种载体上高度分散的VOx物种，特别是MCM-41和Al2O3-SiO2材料。

影响这些催化剂中钒物种性质和行为的关键因素包括：

1. 载体类型：研究了不同的载体，如Al2O3、SiO2（MCM-41）和Al2O3-SiO2（Siral）。

2. 载体比表面积：优选高比表面积载体，以实现VOx物种的更好分散。

3. 金属负载量：催化剂的V负载量控制在单层以下，以避免形成晶态V2O5颗粒。

4. 载体酸度：载体的酸性对于生成具有催化活性的碳物种起着至关重要的作用。

这些变量影响VOx物种的分散度、稳定性和催化性能。最新研究表明，基于VOx的催化剂可以达到与工业相关的PtSn/Al2O3催化剂相当的丙烯产率，并在多个脱氢/再生循环中表现出更好的稳定性。
