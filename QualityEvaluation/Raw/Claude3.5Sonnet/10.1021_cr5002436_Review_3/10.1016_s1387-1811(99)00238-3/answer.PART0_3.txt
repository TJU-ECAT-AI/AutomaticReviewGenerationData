This document does not contain any information about vanadium oxide-based catalysts for paraffin dehydrogenation. The text focuses on gallium and platinum catalysts supported on zeolites, particularly their structural changes during calcination and reduction treatments. It does not discuss vanadium oxide catalysts or their development since the 1980s. The document also does not mention factors like carrier type, support surface area, or metal loading in relation to vanadium species. Therefore, this question cannot be answered based on the given literature.

这篇文献中没有任何关于钒氧化物基催化剂用于烷烃脱氢的信息。文本主要关注负载在分子筛上的镓和铂催化剂,特别是它们在焙烧和还原处理过程中的结构变化。文中没有讨论钒氧化物催化剂或自1980年代以来它们的发展。文献也没有提到载体类型、载体比表面积或金属负载量等因素与钒物种之间的关系。因此,无法根据给定的文献回答这个问题。
