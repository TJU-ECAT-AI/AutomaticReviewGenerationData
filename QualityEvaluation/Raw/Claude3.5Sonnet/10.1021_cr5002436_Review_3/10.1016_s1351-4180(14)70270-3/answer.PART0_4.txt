<EnglishVersionAnswer>

The provided literature does not contain any information about vanadium oxide-based catalysts for paraffin dehydrogenation or their comparison to platinum and chromium oxide catalysts. The document does not discuss the evolution of research in this area since the 1980s, nor does it mention factors like carrier type, support surface area, or metal loading influencing vanadium species in these catalysts. The text appears to focus on other topics related to catalysts and chemical production but does not address the specific subject of the question.

提供的文献中没有关于钒氧化物基催化剂用于烷烃脱氢或其与铂和铬氧化物催化剂的比较的信息。文档没有讨论自1980年代以来该领域研究的演变，也没有提到载体类型、支撑表面积或金属负载等因素对这些催化剂中钒物种的影响。该文本似乎关注于与催化剂和化学生产相关的其他主题，但没有涉及问题中特定的主题。
