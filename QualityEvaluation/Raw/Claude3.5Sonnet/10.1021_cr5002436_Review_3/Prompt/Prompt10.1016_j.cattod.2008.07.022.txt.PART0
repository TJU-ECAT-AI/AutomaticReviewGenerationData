1. Introduction
The catalytic dehydrogenation and oxidative dehydrogenation
(ODH) of light alkanes is an important route to the formation of
alkenes and alkadienes, important precursors for fuels, plastics and
many other materials. In particular, a substantial body of research
has focused on supported VOx catalysts for ODH reactions [16].
Such reactions are believed to proceed via a Marsvan Krevelen
mechanism in which reduced VOx centres that form during
reaction are reoxidised by gas-phase oxygen. Recently, studies
have investigated the direct dehydrogenation of light alkanes over
supported VOx catalysts in the absence of gas-phase oxygen where
a different reaction mechanism must operate [711]. A number of
studies have investigated the structure of supported VOx units in
catalysts for n-butane dehydrogenation [1216]. Despite this,
there remains a lack of understanding as to the distinct role played
by the different surface species present on supported catalysts. In
this work we attempt to redress this through characterisation of a
series of u-Al2O3 supported VOx catalysts at all stages during the
direct dehydrogenation of n-butane in the absence of gas-phase
oxygen: as-prepared, calcined, reduced, post-reaction and post-
regeneration. These data are then related to catalytic activity
measurements providing insights into the relationship between
surface VOx species and catalytic activity and selectivity.
2. Experimental
2.1. Materials
The catalysts employed in this study are alumina-supported
VOx catalysts with nominal metal loadings of 1 wt.%, 3.5 wt.% and
8 wt.%, and their synthesis has previously been described in the
literature [79,14]. These will henceforth be referred to as 1 V,
3.5 V and 8 V, respectively. Prior to use the catalyst extrudates
were ground and sieved to a particle size of 7590 mm.
2.2. Catalytic activity measurements
Catalytic activity data were acquired using a fixed-bed reactor
connected to an on-line GC (Agilent 6890). The catalyst (1.5 cm3)

A series of u-Al2O3 supported VOx catalysts, of different vanadium loadings, have been characterised and
employed for the selective dehydrogenation of n-butane. Characterisation of the unreacted catalysts has
been carried out by solid-state NMR (51V MAS NMR, 27Al MAS NMR and 27Al 3Q-MAS NMR), and FT-IR
spectroscopies, with reference to previously acquired Raman and UVvis spectroscopy data. As vanadium
loading increases, so does the domain size of the supported vanadate units with significant quantities
of V2O5 observed at the highest loadings. The influence of calcination, pre-reduction, reaction and
regeneration on the structure of the catalysts has been studied by NMR, FT-IR, EPR, microanalysis and
TEOM. Calcination disperses crystalline vanadate units, and at high loadings AlVO4 formation is observed.
Pre-reduction reduces the vanadium oxidation state from 5+ to 3+, while regeneration results in the
formation of highly crystalline V5+ species. From these data it is possible to determine structureactivity
relationships, with polymeric vanadia clusters favouring the formation of butenes and butadienes, while
more isolated species are highly active towards the formation of polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbons
retained on the catalyst surface post-reaction. These large polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbons are
however not the principle cause of catalyst deactivation in this reaction.

(0.5 barg, 40 ml min1) and held at this temperature for 2 h. A flow
of He (0.5 barg, 42 ml min1) was then established and the
temperature adjusted to the desired reaction temperature. 3% n-
C4H10/N2 was then introduced (0.5 barg, 60 ml min1) for a period
of 3 h. GC measurements were taken at regular intervals. After 3 h
the catalyst was cooled to room temperature in flowing He and
either removed for ex situ analysis or regenerated at 873 K. For
regeneration the catalyst was heated at 5 K min1, and then held at
873 K for 3 h. Conversion and selectivity were calculated using

2.3. Catalyst characterisation techniques
The catalysts have been characterised spectroscopically by EPR,
FT-IR and solid-state NMR. EPR spectra were measured on a Bruker
ER-200D series EPR spectrometer at room temperature in the
region 2006200 G with a microwave frequency of 9.34 GHz (X-
band). All NMR spectra were acquired on an AV-400 spectrometer
(Bruker). 51V and 27Al MAS NMR spectra were acquired using an
ordinary pulse-acquire sequence, in which the pulse width was
2 ms. Spinning speeds of 12 kHz and 14 kHz were used. The
chemical shifts of 51V and 27Al are referenced to the 51V resonance
of VOCl3 (0 ppm) and to the 27Al resonance of aqueous Al(NO3)3
(0 ppm), respectively. For 27Al 3Q-MAS measurements, the split t1
pulse-sequence of Brown and Wimperis [17] was used, while the
spinning rate was 10 kHz. 13C CP-MAS NMR was conducted at a 13C
operating frequency of 100.65 MHz. Chemical shifts were refer-
enced to a solid CH2 adamantane shift at 38.54 ppm relative to
tetramethylsilane. Diffuse reflectance FT-IR spectra, averaged over
4096 scans, were acquired at room temperature on an Avatar 380
(Thermo Scientific). A tapered element oscillating microbalance
(TEOM 1500, R&P) has been employed to provide measurements of
mass changes occurring during reduction and oxidation experi-
ments. A detailed explanation of the operating principles of the
TEOM is provided by Chen et al. [18].
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Characterisation of as-prepared catalysts
The as-prepared catalysts have been characterised by TEOM,
BET surface area measurements, FT-IR, and solid-state NMR
spectroscopy. Both the structure of the supported VOx units and
that of alumina support have been investigated.
The vanadia loading and BET surface areas of the catalysts are
listed in Table 1. For comparison the surface area of the pure
support material is 106 m2 g1. As expected, the measured
surface area decreases with increasing vanadium loading, from
104 m2 g1 for 1 V to 77 m2 g1 for 8 V. In line with this decrease
in surface area, FT-IR spectra reveal a corresponding loss of
hydroxyl sites. Fig. 1(a) shows FT-IR spectra for the three VOx/
Al2O3 catalysts and the pure support. The broad band, centred at
3500 cm1, present in all spectra corresponds to chemisorbed
water. The hydroxyl groups present have characteristic vibra-
tions from 3200 cm1 to 4000 cm1 and are sequentially titrated
by VOx species with the most basic hydroxyls, i.e. those at higher
wavenumbers (e.g. 3750 cm1), being the first to be lost at low
vanadium
loadings,
while
less
basic
hydroxyls
(at
lower
wavenumbers) are only eliminated at higher loadings. This
behaviour had previously been observed by Turek et al. for a
number of different Al2O3 supported metal oxide catalysts [19].
Inspection of the V
O stretching region (8001200 cm1) in
Fig. 1(a) reveals that in this region the spectra are dominated by
features present in the pure support spectrum. Solid-state 51V
MAS NMR studies reveal further insights. NMR spectra have
been acquired of all the samples and are shown in Fig. 2(a),
focused on the region of interest. An isotropic resonance is
identified at 612 ppm in both 3.5 V and 8 V. This resonance is
indicative of V5+ in a V2O5-like environment. The quantity of
this species, shown by the intensity of the peak, is greater for 8 V
than for 3.5 V, with no signal observed from 1 V. These data
show
good
agreement
with
previous
Raman
spectroscopy
studies [20]. Employing both UV and visible Raman spectro-
scopy these previous studies provided a quantitative determi-
nation of the different surface species (monomeric vanadates,
polymeric vanadates and crystalline vanadia) present [20]. It
was shown that monomeric vanadate species are predominant
on the surface of catalysts with vanadium loadings 1 wt.%. As
the vanadia loading increases, polyvanadate and crystalline
V2O5 become the dominant vanadia species representing 60%
and 10%, respectively of vanadium on the surface of 3.5 V. At
higher loadings the fraction of V2O5 increases, reaching 30% on
8 V consistent with 51V MAS NMR results reported herein.
In the present work,
27Al MAS NMR studies have been
conducted on each of the three catalysts and on the pure
support. In all cases the recorded spectra contain peaks located
in two distinct regions: a sharp, high intensity peak at 6 ppm,
and a broad region of lower intensity between 25 ppm and
70 ppm, illustrated in Fig. 3(a) for 8 V. The peak at 6 ppm is
characteristic of Al in a sixfold, octahedral, co-ordination while
the downfield region may contain aluminium in both fivefold
and fourfold (tetrahedral) co-ordinations. In addition to con-
ventional MAS NMR spectra, 27Al 3Q-MAS NMR spectra have
also been acquired, as illustrated in Fig. 3(b) for 8 V. The
projection of such spectra in the 27Al indirect dimension (F1)
yields the isotropic peaks, while the anisotropic lineshapes
(corresponding to a standard MAS spectrum) are displayed by
the projection in the
27Al directly detected single-quantum
dimension (F2). The resolution of the isotropic signals provided

by the 3Q-MAS experiment confirms the presence of both 5- and
4-co-ordinate Al in addition to octahedral Al. The isotropic
resonances of these three environments are 78.2 ppm, 73.2 ppm
and 10.2 ppm.
3.2. Influence of calcination on catalyst structure
The catalysts employed in this study have been pre-calcined at
823 K. Calcination temperature is known to strongly influence

catalyst structure and therefore catalytic performance [21,22].
Such differences can be explained by changes in the catalyst
structure induced by calcination, studied herein by solid-state MAS
NMR and FT-IR spectroscopy. Fig. 2(b) shows the MAS NMR
spectrum of 3.5 V after calcination at 973 K. Compared to the as-
prepared material the intensity of the V2O5 peak has reduced by
71%, while simultaneously a broad peak appears, assigned to more
dispersed V5+ in distorted tetrahedral environments [23]. Upon
increasing the catalyst loading to 8 wt.% V a similar sharp decrease
in the intensity of the V2O5 peak (612 ppm) occurs after
calcination, with the intensity of the broad background corre-
sponding to disordered V5+ species also decreasing. In addition, the
formation of aluminium orthovanadate, AlVO4, was observed;
characterised by the appearance of peaks at 659 ppm, 757 ppm
and 769 ppm [22,24] (Fig. 2(c)). Structurally, AlVO4 contains
three distinct, isolated, units, giving rise to the three peaks
observed by 51V MAS NMR [24]. The presence of AlVO4 in 8 V after
calcination is further confirmed through inspection of both FT-IR
(Fig. 1(d)) and 27Al MAS NMR spectra (Fig. 3(c)). A shoulder at
965 cm1 in the FT-IR spectrum is indicative of AlVO4 [25,26].
These spectra also confirm the dispersion of crystalline VOx species
through the development of the band at 1057 cm1 in the V
O
stretching region. Considering the 27Al MAS NMR spectrum of 8 V
after calcination, the additional peak at 9 ppm clearly present
can, by comparison with the spectrum of the pure material [24], be
assigned to AlVO4. Additionally, 27Al MAS NMR studies (Fig. 3(c))
reveal that after calcination the amount of 5-co-ordinate Al
detected in 8 V increases considerably, from 1% to 10% as a
result of AlVO4 formation. The formation of AlVO4 through the
interaction of VOx species and alumina under oxidising conditions
at the temperatures employed herein is well known [21,22,24,27
32]: however it is dependent upon vanadium loading with high
loadings promoting AlVO4 formation [22,27]. Steinfeldt et al. [22]
have previously studied the calcination of g-alumina-supported
vanadium catalysts and noted AlVO4 formation only at metal
loadings above 4.5 wt.%. Also in agreement with the present study,
Steinfeldt et al. observed that at calcination temperatures above
873 K crystalline vanadia species were transformed into smaller
polymeric clusters. In the present work, Raman spectroscopy of 8 V
after reaction reveals a greater dispersion of VOx species than in the
as-prepared catalysts. This may be due to the dispersion of such
species during the calcination procedure.
Considering the influence of calcination on hydroxyl groups, FT-
IR studies, Fig. 1(bd), show that upon calcination of catalyst at
973 K and re-exposure to atmosphere, both basic and acidic OH
groups remain on the surface, however the quantity of chemi-
sorbed water is reduced. While some rehydroxylation of the
surface will occur upon exposure to atmosphere it should be noted
that a recent IR study has revealed that u-Al2O3 does not fully
dehydroxylate below 1200 K [33].
3.3. Hydrogen and hydrocarbon reducing environments
The catalytically active species for n-butane dehydrogenation
are believed to be reduced VOx species [7,9,16]. Such reduced
species may be formed either by pre-reduction of the catalysts in
H2, investigated herein by TEOM, or through in situ reduction by
the hydrocarbon during reaction, investigated herein by FT-IR,
NMR and EPR spectroscopies. These studies demonstrate that
reduction effects changes in both VOx and Al2O3 species, with
vanadium being reduced from V5+ to V3+, and Al2O3 undergoing a
phase transformation towards a more crystalline material.
The TEOM provides an in situ measurement of mass change as a
function of time-on-stream, and therefore allows for the redox
behaviour of materials to be followed as such processes involve
mass changes due to the addition/removal of oxygen. Barteau and
co-workers have previously employed TEOM to study such process
in VPO catalysts [3437]. In this work we have studied the
interaction of 1 V, 3.5 V, 8 V and the pure support, previously
calcined in situ at 723 K, with 100% H2 (50 cm3 min1, 0.1 barg)
over 2 h at 673 K. This allows mass loss from the catalysts,
including the loss of oxygen from VOx species, to be followed
quantitatively with time; the results of this are shown in Fig. 4(a).
As can be seen, mass loss is directly related to VOx loading. For
instance after 2 h 8 V has lost 37.7 mg/mgcat while 1 V only
24.3 mg/mgcat. The reduction of VOx species is not the only source
of mass loss from the catalysts, as indicated by the significant mass
loss from the pure support. Approximately the same mass loss
from the pure support is observed under reducing conditions in
complementary TGA-H2 studies, and is assigned to the desorption
of water [9]. Additionally LeBars et al. have suggested that oxygen
can be lost from alumina in VOx/Al2O3 catalysts in reducing
atmospheres at 823 K [38]. LeBars et al. calculated a loss of 4% of
lattice oxygen atoms from the support for VOx/g-Al2O3 catalyst.
Applying the same calculation to the present work yields a value of
4.8%. Regardless of the source of the mass loss from alumina its
effects need to be taken into account when considering the
reduction of VOx/Al2O3 catalysts. As an approximation one can
assume that the support loses the same quantity of material per
unit mass with or without vanadium present. The number of

147
oxygen atoms lost per unit vanadium can then be calculated
(Table 2) and these data converted into a vanadium oxidation state
as that in the as-prepared catalyst is known to be 5+ [9]. The overall
trend of reduction is seen to be towards the formation of V3+. That
the higher loading catalysts apparently show a lesser degree of
reduction than 1 V may be a consequence of the assumption that
the catalysts all lose the same mass from the support. As a result,
the oxidation state calculated for catalysts with lower surface areas
will be artificially high. Despite this caveat, UVvis DRS measure-
ments during TGA-H2 studies reveal the same trend as these TEOM
data with mass loss, in oxygen atoms per vanadium, of 1.0 for 1 V
and 0.8 for 8 V [9]. As an approximation all three catalyst can be
assumed to show a reduction in vanadium oxidation state from 5+
to 3+, in agreement with the literature data [15,39,40].
Despite the apparent reduction of V5+ to V3+, previous UVvis
DRS studies have clearly demonstrated the presence of partially
reduced V4+ species after reduction in H2 [9]. V4+ species are also
observed in the present study by EPR spectroscopy after reduction
of VOx during the n-butane dehydrogenation reaction. EPR spectra
revealed features around g 2 indicative of the presence of an axial
V4+ ion with evidence of partially resolved hyperfine coupling to
51V. Furthermore, peaks to lower field (2700 G) and an additional
half-field feature around 1450 G imply the presence of lower
oxidation state V species such as V3+ [41]. In contrast to EPR
spectroscopy, diffuse reflectance FT-IR spectroscopy did not yield
satisfactory results as the dark colour of the catalysts, resulting
from both coke deposition and VOx reduction, resulted in very high
absorption. Additionally, after reaction no 51V MAS NMR spectrum
was observable. The loss of a signal corresponding to 51V can be
assigned to the formation of paramagnetic reduced vanadium
species such as V3+ and V4+, which are themselves unobservable
and, under certain structural conditions, prevent the observation of
V5+. This is due to the dipole interaction between the magnetic
moments of the V5+ nuclei and the paramagnetic nuclei causing the
spectral lines to be broadened, often beyond detection [23,42,43].
27Al MAS NMR spectra do not suffer from the same loss of signal
as 51V MAS NMR spectra after butane dehydrogenation. Reaction is
however observed to have a surprising effect on the nature of the
spectra observed. In particular, at higher reaction temperatures, the
shape of the peaks changes significantly. For instance, considering
the 27Al MAS spectrum of 8 V after reaction at 973 K (not shown) the
observed peaks can no longer be approximated by pseudo-Voigt
lineshapes but instead are characteristic of a powder pattern [44].
Furthermore, the 5-co-ordinate Al present prior to reduction has
been lost. 3.5 V undergoes a similar structural transformation,
however 1 V and the pure support do not. At lower reaction
temperatures, such as 823 K (the temperature employed in catalytic
activity studies, Section 3.4) these changes either do not occur or are
much less pronounced. We propose that the origin of the observed
changes is a vanadium catalysed phase change of the support
towards a more crystalline form. Further support for this hypothesis
is provided by surface area measurements, discussed in Section 3.4.
A similar phase-change has previously been observed for a 7 wt.% V/
g-Al2O3 employed in the dehydrogenation of propane at 873 K [45].
The influence of vanadium species on the crystallinity of alumina
supports has alsobeenprobedbyEl-Shobaky etal. [27]andSaid[30].
In non-catalytic systems, vanadium-doped g-Al2O3 undergoes
phase transformations at lower temperatures than pure g-Al2O3
[46,47]. This may be caused by the dissolution of vanadium into the
alumina.
3.4. Relationship to catalytic behaviour
The activity of 1 V, 3.5 V and 8 V towards butane dehydro-
genation has been evaluated, in order to determine the surface
species responsible for the different reactions occurring during
the catalytic process. The main reactions occurring are the
formation of retained carbon and the formation of butenes and
butadienes.
Fig.
5(a)
shows
the
observed
conversion
and
selectivity towards 1-butene and 1,3-butadiene for the three
catalysts. In combination with catalyst characterisation data,
these data suggest that more isolated VOx species show the
greatest activity towards coke formation while polymeric VOx are
the most active in the dehydrogenation reaction.
While, at 57%, the conversion obtained over 1 V appears high as
compared to the other catalysts, this is not a positive attribute as
the selectivity towards C4 dehydrogenation products is very low;
12.7% for 1-butene and 8.1% for 1,3-butadiene. The principle
reason for these low values is the high selectivities to retained
carbon. Fig. 6 shows 13C CP-MAS spectra of the reacted catalysts.

stream. (b) Conversion (solid line) and 1-butene selectivity (dashed line) at 873 K for 3.5 V calcined at 823 K () and 973 K ().

The large central peak is indicative of carbon in polyolefinic or
polynuclear aromatic environments. Elemental microanalysis,
shown in Table 3, confirms that the area under the NMR peaks
is directly proportional to the amount of coke deposited. It is also
possible that some combustion products are formed through
interaction with lattice oxygen which are not detected by the FID.
In contrast to ODH reactions however, the quantity of such
material produced in the direct dehydrogenation of n-butane will
be very low, as only a very small quantity of oxygen is available for
this reaction. This is the case is confirmed through comparison of
the elemental microanalysis data (Table 3) and the catalytic
activity data (Fig. 5) which indicate that all of the converted n-
butane can be accounted for through the formation of hydro-
carbons
and
deposited
coke.
CP-MAS
NMR
and
elemental
microanalysis both indicate that 1 V forms very much more coke
than either 3.5 V or 8 V despite its lower vanadium loading. This
suggests that the more isolated species present on the surface of
1 V are much more efficient at forming carbonaceous material than
polymeric and crystalline VOx species. Previous studies of coke
formation on these catalysts by Raman spectroscopy have also
observed a far higher selectivity to carbon formation for isolated
VOx than for more polymerised vanadia species [7,9]. While more
isolated species show the greatest activity towards carbon
formation the data shown in Fig. 5(a) suggest that polymeric
vanadia species show the greatest activity in the dehydrogenation
reaction. As the quantity of such species increase (1 V < 3.5 V
< 8 V) so does the selectivity towards butenes and butadienes.
Further evidence that polymeric species are the most active is
provided by studies on 3.5 V calcined at two different tempera-
tures,
823 K
and
973 K,
prior
to
reaction
at
873 K.
High
temperature calcination has been shown to increase the quantity
of polymeric species through dispersion of more crystalline
vanadia (Section 3.2). Fig. 5(b) shows that the catalyst calcined
at 973 K provides a higher conversion of n-butane, particularly in
the early stages of reaction where a value of 63% is observed after
25 min, compared to only 49% for the catalyst calcined at the lower
temperature. Selectivity towards 1-butene is also improved. These
results show good agreement with the previous conclusions of
Jackson et al. [8,9]. It should be noted that in contrast to the work of
Jackson et al. the present study employs a lower space velocity
(1400 h1), resulting in a higher selectivity towards butadienes.
3.5. Catalyst oxidation and regeneration
The reoxidation of catalysts reduced in H2 (Section 3.3) and the
regeneration of reacted catalysts (Section 3.4) has been investi-
gated. Data on the extent and rate of reoxidation is provided by
TEOM, while solid-state NMR, FT-IR, and BET surface area
measurements reveal structural changes in the regenerated
catalysts compared to the as-prepared samples.
In TEOM studies the reduced catalysts were reoxidised using
100% O2 (50 cm3 min1, 0.1 barg) at 723 K. Table 4 shows the
fraction of oxygen replaced as t ! 1 and the initial rate of this
reoxidation process. These values are calculated from Eqs. (3) and
(4), respectively; analyses previously applied to the reoxidation of
VOx/TiO2 catalysts by Soczynski et al. [15].

process. It is clear from Table 4 that reoxidation does not replace
100% of the oxygen removed during reduction, with lower loading
catalysts taking up less oxygen, e.g. 1 V replaces 71% of the lost
oxygen compared to 83% for 8 V. The rate of reoxidation is also
slower for lower loading catalysts. Fig. 4(b) shows this rate as a
function of the degree of reoxidation for three catalysts. It is clear
that 8 V reoxidises at faster rate than either 1 V or 3.5 V; the initial
rate of reoxidation being 0.2 s1, as compared to 0.1 s1 for 1 V
and 3.5 V. It therefore appears that larger clusters of vanadia units
are easier to reoxidise than smaller polymeric or monomeric units.
That less oxygen is required for regeneration than was removed
during reduction can be explained if larger aggregates of vanadium
were to exist on the reoxidised catalysts than on the as-prepared
materials as larger clusters have lower O/V ratios; 4:1 for
monomeric vanadates, 7:2 for dimers and 5:2 for V2O5. The
observation that lower loading catalysts reoxidise to a lesser
degree has also previously been noted by UVvis DRS studies [9].
A change in the structure of regenerated catalysts is confirmed
through investigation by a variety of techniques. These changes
affect both the supported vanadia species and the Al2O3 support.
Changes in the structure of the VOx units are observed through 51V
MAS NMR and FT-IR spectroscopies. After reaction the catalysts do
not yield an observable 51V MAS NMR signal, however regeneration
results in the restoration of a spectrum due the oxidation of

paramagnetic V3+ and V4+ into V5+ species. As Fig. 2(d) shows, the
spectrum of the regenerated catalyst (in this case 8 V) differs from
that of the as-prepared catalyst. The principle difference between
the two is that the broad hump, corresponding to disordered V5+, is
much reduced in the spectrum of the regenerated catalyst and the
intensity of the V2O5 peak (d = 612 ppm) is significantly increased.
The spectrum of the regenerated catalyst bears a close resemblance
to that of pure V2O5 [48]. This confirms that the vanadium present is
in a much more ordered, crystalline, environment than it was prior
to reaction. Considering the V
O stretching region in IR spectra
(Fig. 1(b)(d)) itisnotedthatpeakstohigh wavenumber are reduced
in size whilethose atlower wavenumber are increased,such thatthe
spectrum of 8 V after regeneration is dominated by a band at
1005 cm1. Similar, but less pronounced, changes are also noted for
3.5 V and 1 V. Comparison with the other data in this work suggests
that these changes correspond to the formation of more crystalline
VOx species. Studies on regenerated catalysts therefore support the
conclusions from TEOM studies that larger clusters of vanadia are
present
after
reoxidation.
These changes
alter
the
catalytic
behaviour of the regenerated catalysts with respect to that of the
as-prepared materials, as discussed below. For instance, the loss of
polymeric VOx species through the formation of more crystalline
species results in reduced n-butane conversion as crystalline VOx
have a lower catalytic activity than polymeric species (Section 3.4).
Changes in the nature of the support are observed by 27Al NMR,
FT-IR and BET surface area studies. Table 1 shows that the
regenerated catalysts have reduced surface area as compared to
the as-prepared materials. 1 V has lost only 5% of its surface area,
however that of 8 V has reduced by 58% in line with the observed
crystallisation of both VOx species and of the support (Section 3.4).
This loss of surface area also results in a reduction in the amount of
chemisorbed water as observed by FT-IR (Fig. 1(b)(d)). Addition-
ally, both 27Al MAS NMR and 27Al 3Q-MAS NMR techniques have
been employed to study 8 V regenerated at 873 K. The 27Al 3Q-MAS
NMR spectrum (Fig. 3(d)) shows only two resonances in the
isotropic projection, at 9.8 ppm and 79.8 ppm, indicating that
regeneration has not restored the 5-co-ordinate Al lost under
reaction conditions and has not therefore recovered the initial
state of the alumina. This is further confirmed by 27Al MAS studies
which show a similar powder pattern spectrum to the sample after
reaction. Furthermore, regeneration is not observed to result in the
appearance of a peak at 9 ppm suggesting that AlVO4 was not
formed at this temperature.
These structural changes to the VOx/Al2O3 catalysts after
regeneration result in changes in their catalytic behaviour. Jackson
and Rugmini have studied these catalysts during multiple n-
butane dehydrogenation reaction cycles [9]. It was observed that
the catalyst activity differed in the second and subsequent cycles
from that seen in the first, e.g. after 15 min on stream n-butane
conversion over 3.5 V was 32.9% and 19.1% for the as-prepared and
regenerated catalysts, respectively. That this was due to a change
in the nature of the VOx species after regeneration was confirmed
by UVvis spectroscopy studies. In the present work regeneration
of the catalysts has been carried out at 873 K, in order to remove
the polynuclear aromatics that have formed during reaction.
However, such species are not the primary cause of catalyst
deactivation in the n-butane dehydrogenation reaction. Recent
TPO studies have shown that >75% of the observed catalyst
deactivation is due to strongly bound reaction intermediates
which can be removed from the surface under mild conditions [9].
4. Conclusions
Through the application of a number of analytical techniques
we have provided additional insight as to the relationship between
surface VOx species and catalytic activity towards n-butane
dehydrogenation. Isolated vanadia species show high activity,
but very low selectivity due to the undesirable formation of coke.
Polymeric VOx species however show a greater selectivity towards
the desired C4 dehydrogenation products. The formation of
polymeric vanadates from V2O5-like surface species can be
achieved through treatment with O2 at high temperatures, thereby
increasing catalytic activity. After regeneration, the catalytic
activity of the catalysts changes as a result of transformations to
both the surface VOx species and the pure support, with vanadium
appearing to catalyse a phase transformation in Al2O3 above 823 K.
The polyolefinic coke species removed by high temperature
regeneration are not however the principle source of catalyst
deactivation, which can instead be assigned to tightly bound
reaction intermediates.
