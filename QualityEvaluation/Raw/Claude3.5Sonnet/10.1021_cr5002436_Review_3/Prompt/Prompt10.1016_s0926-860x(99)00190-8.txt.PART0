Abstract
Molybdenum oxide supported on SiC is shown to be an active and stable catalyst for the dehydrogenation of n-butane. The
activity of the catalyst was studied in a fixed bed microreactor, and the reaction product was analysed by an on-line FTIR
technique that enabled study of the activity of the catalyst during the first minutes on stream. At 560C under atmospheric
pressure, the conversion of n-butane and the selectivity for C4 alkenes were stable at 20% and 70%, respectively. The n-butane
feed was diluted with hydrogen and water, which were required for the formation of the active phase and for stable operation.
The active phase in dehydrogenation was composed of molybdenum oxide modified with carbon and limited to the uppermost
layer of the catalyst. 1999 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

1. Introduction
For thermodynamic reasons, dehydrogenation must
be carried out at relatively high temperatures, with
consequent requirements laid down for the catalyst
systems. Two types of catalyst are currently used in
the commercial dehydrogenation processes of isobu-
tane: supported chromium oxide and supported plat-
inum metal [1,2]. However, several drawbacks are as-
sociated with these catalysts. Chromium oxide cata-
lysts deactivate rapidly and require frequent regenera-
tion. Moreover, after regeneration, a part of chromium
is in the oxidation state Cr6+ which is carcinogenic.

The platinum catalyst must be modified with additives
and is highly sensitive to impurities in the feed, such
as traces of water and oxygenates.
Since their development several decades ago, sili-
con carbide materials have been used in a broad range
of applications [3] that exploit their high thermal con-
ductivity, high resistance to oxidation, considerable
chemical inertness and good mechanical strength. The
high thermal conductivity allows the use of SiC in
catalytic processes that are highly exothermic or en-
dothermic. The combination of these properties, and
the fact that it can be prepared with high surface area
[48] make silicon carbide a good candidate for use
as catalyst support. Already, molybdenum oxides sup-
ported on SiC have been shown to exhibit appreciable
activity in the isomerisation of n-paraffins [9,10].

In earlier studies [1113], we showed that unsup-
ported MoO3 modified with carbon is capable of high
initial activity in the dehydrogenation of n-butane, but
unfortunately, it is unstable under the required reac-
tion conditions. The conversion of n-butane decreased
from 25% to 12% during the first 2 h mainly because
of sintering of the active phase [12]. In the present
study, we demonstrate improved catalytic properties
of molybdenum oxide modified with carbon when the
active phase is supported on silicon carbide. The de-
hydrogenation of n-butane was used as a test reaction.
The catalytic activity was also compared with activi-
ties obtained on corresponding silica and alumina sup-
ported catalysts.
2. Experimental
2.1. Catalyst preparation
The supports used in the experiments were silicon
carbide, alumina and silica. The silicon carbide was of
medium surface area, 26 m2 g1 and was prepared by
a gassolid reaction (SiO vapours and solid carbon)
according to the method of Ledoux and co-workers
[5,14]. The gaseous side-products COx (CO and/or
CO2) formed during the course of the synthesis were
pumped off from the reaction zone so that the reaction
equilibrium was shifted towards the products. Before
impregnation, the support material was calcined in air
at 600C for 2 h in order to burn off any remaining car-
bon. The support had a pore size of about 1020 nm,
which gave the reactants easy access to the catalyst.
The synthesis technique and the properties of the ma-
terial have been reported in detail elsewhere [5,15].
The SiC supported catalyst was prepared by the in-
cipient wetness method with use of an aqueous so-
lution of ammonium heptamolybdate (Strem Chemi-
cals, purity 99.8%). After impregnation, the catalyst
was left overnight at room temperature and then dried
at 110C in an oven. Finally, it was calcined at 550C
for 2 h in order to transform the molybdenum salt to
its corresponding oxide. The particle size of the cata-
lyst was 0.40.8 mm.
Molybdenum oxide catalysts on alumina and on sil-
ica were similarly prepared by the incipient wetness
method from an aqueous solution of ammonium hep-
tamolybdate (Merck, >99%). After impregnation, the
samples were left overnight at room temperature, dried
at 120C for 8 h and calcined at 600C for 6 h in a flow
of 5% O2 in N2. The alumina extrudates (Akzo Nobel
0001.5E) were crushed and sieved to a particle size
of 0.30.5 mm, and silica (Grace Davison S432) was
sieved to a particle size of 0.30.5 mm. Before impreg-
nation, the supports were calcined at 600C for 16 h.
The surface areas of the supports were 198 m2 g1 for
alumina and 317 m2 g1 for silica.
2.2. Catalyst characterisation techniques
Elemental analysis was done by atomic absorption
spectroscopy (AAS) at the Service Central dAnalyse
(CNRS, France).
Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) was carried out on
a Siemens Model D-5000 diffractometer with Cu Ka
radiation (λ = 0.154056 nm). The measurement was
performed with steps of 0.05 degrees of 2θ and 5 s
per step. The sample was crushed in an agate mortar
and the powder was fixed on a glass slide. The crys-
talline phase was confirmed through reference to the
data base of the Joint Committee on Powder Diffrac-
tion Standards (JCPDS).
The specific surface area and pore size distribution
were measured with a Coulter SA 3100 analyser. The
standard pre-treatment consisted of heating the cata-
lyst under dynamic vacuum at 300C for 2 h in order to
desorb impurities from the catalyst surface. Nitrogen
was used as the adsorbate gas and the measurements
were carried out at the temperature of liquid nitrogen.
Temperature programmed reduction (TPR) meas-
surements were performed under pure hydrogen flow
(20 cm3 min1) in an all-glass microreactor described
in detail elsewhere [16]. The catalyst was placed on a
silica fritted disc, and the temperature was raised from
room temperature to 8001000C at a heating rate
of 20C min1. Typically, the sample (0.0020.005 g)
was used in powder form. Water and other products
formed in TPR were detected with a Saturn III Varian
mass spectrometer operating in continuous mode.
Temperature programmed oxidation (TPO) of the
catalysts after the reaction was carried out in situ in
an all-glass microreactor at atmospheric pressure. The
catalyst was flushed with helium at 100C for 30 min
to desorb moisture or impurities from the surface. The

313
helium flow was then replaced by a mixture of oxygen
(10 vol%) diluted with helium (40 cm3 min1) and the
reactor temperature was raised from 100C to 550C
at a heating rate of 10C min1. The gaseous efflu-
ents were continuously monitored with a mass spec-
trometer (Varian Ion Trap Model Saturn III). Calibra-
tions were performed with molybdenum carburized
phase [11,17] for identification of the peaks and with
a known amount of active carbon (Fluka) for quanti-
tative analysis of the carbon on the catalyst.
2.3. Tests of catalyst activity
The activity of the catalyst was measured in a fixed
bed microreactor where the catalyst load of 0.5 g was
placed in a quartz reactor. Temperatures were meas-
ured in the middle of the bed. The catalyst was heated
to the reaction temperature under nitrogen flow (AGA,
purity 99.999%), with the nitrogen further purified
with Oxisorb (Messer Griesheim). Catalyst activity
was measured at temperatures between 530C and
560C under atmospheric pressure. The weight hourly
space velocity (WHSV) was varied between 1 and
5 h1. The comparison of the catalysts was carried
out at 560C at a WHSV of 2 h1. The n-butane feed
(AGA, 99.95%) was diluted with hydrogen (AGA,
99.999%) at a molar ratio of hydrogen to n-butane of 9
to 1. A small amount of water (25 mol%) was added
to the hydrogen stream with a saturator.
After the activity test, the catalyst was regenerated
with diluted air containing 1 mol% O2 (AGA, 99.5%)
and 3 mol% water in nitrogen. The amount of car-
bonaceous species deposited was calculated from the
carbon oxides formed during the regeneration. Sev-
eral catalytic cycles were performed with one catalyst
sample.
The products were analysed with a Fourier trans-
form infra red (FTIR) gas analyser (Gasmet, Temet
Instruments Ltd.). Spectra were measured in the wave
number range 8504000 cm1 with a resolution of
8 cm1 and a scanning rate of 10 scans per second. The
cuvette (9 cm3) was maintained at a constant tempera-
ture of 175C and a pressure of 103 kPa. The analyser
was calibrated with pure compounds diluted with ni-
trogen: methane, ethane, ethene, propane, propene, i-
butane, i-butene, n-butane, 1-butene, cis-2-butene, tr-
2-butene, 1,3-butadiene, CO, CO2, benzene, toluene
and water. The amounts of water, carbon monoxide
and carbon dioxide formed in the reaction or during
reduction were measured, and the average oxidation
state of molybdenum was calculated. The amount of
carbon oxides released during regeneration was meas-
ured and the total amount of carbonaceous species es-
timated. Details of the analytical method have been
presented elsewhere [18].
2.4. Definitions
The conversion and selectivities were calculated
from the reactor effluent on the basis of the carbon
balance: the total amount of carbon in hydrocarbon
compounds in the effluent was assumed to be equal
to the amount of carbon in the n-butane fed to the
reactor. In this way, the coke deposited on the cata-
lyst during the dehydrogenation reaction was ignored.
The total molar amount of n-butane fed to the reactor
is equal to Cnbin.

3. Results
3.1. Characterisation of fresh catalysts
According to elemental analysis, molybdenum con-
centrations were 14.2, 15.9 and 13.9 wt.%, respec-
tively, for the SiC, Al2O3 and SiO2 supported cat-
alysts. The XRD patterns of the catalysts are pre-
sented in Fig. 1. MoOx/SiC and MoOx/SiO2 gave rise
to diffraction lines corresponding to the supports and
MoO3 (orthorhombic structure). The MoO3 diffrac-
tion lines were sharper on SiC than on silica, indicat-
ing that the particles of the molybdenum compound
were larger on SiC. The broad contribution centred at
22on the XRD pattern of SiO2 supported catalyst can
be due to the amorphous phase of SiO2, that was also
seen in the diffractogram of the calcined SiO2 sup-
port. Crystalline Al2(MoO4)3 and g-Al2O3 were de-
tected on the alumina support. The surface area of the
SiC supported catalyst changed to 12 m2 g1, as com-
pared to the SiC support (26 m2 g1), probably due,
as already reported elsewhere [9], to the formation
of MoO3 particles which blocked the support surface.
The addition of molybdenum oxide on alumina did
not significantly change the surface area based on the
area calculated as weight fraction of the support, but
on silica, the surface area decreased by about half the
original value, indicating the blockage of some pores.
As can be seen in Fig. 2, the TPR spectra of the
three catalysts are totally different. The spectrum of
the alumina supported catalyst has two maxima, at
430C and 560C, the first related to the partial reduc-
tion of octahedrally coordinated molybdenum species
in multilayers and the second to the reduction of crys-
talline Al2(MoO4)3 [1923]. On the silica support, Mo
species were reduced at 530C and 730C, but on SiC
at higher temperatures. According to Lopez Cordero
et al. [20], bulk MoO3 typically is reduced at tem-
peratures above 600C. Possibly, the higher reduction
temperature of SiC than the silica supported catalyst is
due to the better crystallised MoO3 particles on SiC,
as indicated also by XRD, or due to a stronger interac-
tion between the Mo species and the SiC support than
between the Mo species and the silica support. Both
these possibilities would be affected by differences in
the surface areas (Table 1).

3.2. Activity of MoO3/SiC
The dehydrogenation activity and C4 alkene selecti-
vity obtained on the MoOx/SiC catalyst as a func-
tion of time on stream (560C, WHSV 2 h1) are
reported in Fig. 3. After a rapid increase during the
first minutes, the conversion remained almost sta-
ble during the 1 h test, being 21% after 5 min and
17% after 1 h on stream. This means that deactiva-
tion was relatively low under the reaction conditions
and a clear improvement was achieved relative to
the unsupported catalyst [11,12]. The selectivity for
C4 alkenes was low at the beginning of the test but
rose rapidly, reaching the steady state value at about
70%.
From Fig. 3, it is clear that some changes in the
catalytic activity took place just after the hydrocar-
bon feed was introduced. The analysis system allowed
almost continuous monitoring of the product stream
and a detailed analysis could be performed. Fig. 4(a)
shows the product distribution in molar basis during
the first 10 min. The feed components were n-butane
(omitted in Fig. 4), hydrogen and water 3 mol% (mag-
nitude divided by 4 in Fig. 4). It is clear that the high
conversion and low selectivity at the beginning were
mainly due to the formation of carbon oxides. If we
assume that all oxygen atoms in carbon oxides and the
water formed are derived from the catalyst, and that
all the molybdenum is in oxidation state +6, then the
molybdenum species must have been reduced from +6
to +4 in 3 min on an average. The catalyst was also
reduced with hydrogen and water at 560C for 2 min
before the hydrocarbon feed was started. As can be
seen in Fig. 4(b), the production of carbon oxides was
Fig. 4. (a) Product distribution with the catalyst MoOx/SiC as

distribution was measured every 7 s during the first 3 min on stream,
and every 30 s after that. (b) Product distribution after 2 min of

now significantly reduced, but the product distribution
otherwise remained the same.
Some carbon monoxide was still being formed af-
ter the initial reduction of molybdenum oxide, that
is, after several minutes on stream. According to the
oxygen balance, the total amount of oxygen in water
and carbon monoxide of the product was equal to the
amount of oxygen in the water feed. This means that
no oxygen was derived from the catalyst at this stage.
From the presence of i-butene and i-butane in the
product distribution, it is evident that, in addition to
the dehydrogenation activity, the catalyst has an iso-
merisation capability. The main side reaction was the
cracking to C1C3 hydrocarbons.
One experiment was carried out without hydrogen.
Heating to 560C under nitrogen was followed im-
mediately by introduction of the hydrocarbon feed
(N2/HC 9/1 mol/mol + 3 mol% H2O). Initially, the re-
duction of the catalyst was very slow; after 2 min on
M.E. Harlin et al. / Applied Catalysis A: General 185 (1999) 311322
317
stream, the average oxidation state of the molybdenum
compounds was +5.6. But then it decreased rapidly to
+4.4 after 5 min. The maximum conversion was only
10% and the reaction was not selective for dehydro-
genation. The carbon content of the catalyst after the
test of 15 min was 0.1 wt.%. Clearly, the presence of
hydrogen is essential for the formation of the catalyt-
ically active phase.
MoO3/SiC was reduced with hydrogen for 2 h at
450C to form MoO2/SiC [24]. After this reduction,
the conversion of n-butane was 40% and the selectivity
for C4 alkenes only 20% at 560C after 2 min on
stream (n-butane, hydrogen and water). We concluded,
therefore, that MoO2 was not the most active phase in
dehydrogenation.
The effect of the process variables was as expected:
the conversion increased with temperature and with
decreasing WHSV. The highest C4 alkene yield, 20%,
was obtained at 560C.
At thermodynamic equilibrium, the conversion of
n-butane to n-butenes, 1,3-butadiene and hydrogen is
29% under the conditions used for this study (560C,
atmospheric pressure and hydrogen/n-butane feed
9 mol/mol).
3.3. Characterisation of the spent catalyst
The XRD patterns of the SiC supported catalyst as a
function of time on stream are presented in Fig. 5. The
MoO3 phase was reduced to several sub-oxides, e.g.
Mo4O11 and MoO2. The stable molybdenum oxide,
i.e. MoO2, was the sole crystalline phase when the
reaction time was extended. This agrees very well with
the average degree of reduction measured from the
product distribution. An increase in the surface area
from 12 to 17 m2 g1, along with a small increase in
pore volume, was observed during the reaction.
The total coke content of the catalyst was meas-
ured by in situ burning of carbon after the tests. After
15 min, the amount of carbon was ca. 0.05 wt.%. This
means that the atomic ratio of carbon to molybdenum
was 0.03, which was relatively low considering the
high reaction temperature.
The TPO spectra of the catalyst after 30 min and
1, 3 and 5 h of reaction (Fig. 6) show the presence of
carbon atoms in different forms on the catalyst. After
30 min, the TPO peak (CO2, m/z = 44) was relatively
large and composed of several peaks, i.e. carbon in var-
ious carbonaceous forms. The spectrum recorded at 1 h
could be decomposed into four Gaussian peaks cen-
tred at 220C, 280C, 360C and 405C. The spectra
obtained after 3 and 5 h could be interpreted in a simi-
lar way. The TPO spectrum was calibrated by running
tests with molybdenum oxycarbide prepared at 350C
(oxygen-rich) [17] and 550C (carbon-rich, carbide-
like phase) [11] under the same conditions. From the
results, we concluded that the peak at about 405C cor-
responded to molybdenum oxide modified with car-
bon (an oxygen-rich compound), probably oxycarbide.
The other peaks may have been due to coke and its
precursors. However, the total amount of carbon in-
corporated in the catalyst was low; the atomic ratio
of carbon to molybdenum was only 0.01 after 30 min
and 0.04 after 3 h. By comparison, a value of 0.03 was
measured during regeneration after an experiment of
15 min. It should be added that the accuracy of FTIR
measurements at low carbon contents may not be suf-
ficient.
3.4. Influence of water
With the unsupported MoO3 [11,12], the presence
of water was essential to maintain the high selectiv-
ity for C4 alkenes. To study the influence of water on
the behaviour of the supported catalysts, we varied the
amount of water in the feed from 2.3 to 5.1 mol% in
consecutive runs. The results are collected in Fig. 7.
The maximum yield of C4 alkenes, 16%, was obtained
with a water content of 3.5 mol%. Smaller amounts of
water led to higher conversion but reduced the selectiv-
ity by increasing the cracking reactions. The isobutene
formation was the highest with 3.5 mol% water. It was
interesting to observe that the formation of CO fol-
lowed that of methane (Fig. 8).
During the last cycle, the water feed was stopped
after 15 min. Within 2 min, the conversion increased
from 17% to 57%, while the selectivity for C4 alkenes
dropped from 80% to 20%. The main products were
light hydrocarbons and CO, and some benzene and
toluene were formed as well. Evidently, the presence
of water is critical for the catalytic activity. The XRD
results presented by Ledoux et al. [12] indicated that
the effect of water was not limited to only the selective
poisoning of hydrogenolysis sites.

3.5. Influence of regeneration
To study the influence of regeneration on the cat-
alytic activity, the catalyst was used at 560C and at
a WHSV of 2 h1 for 15 min, after which it was re-
generated with diluted air for 15 min. The dehydro-
genation run was repeated seven times. Fig. 9 depicts
the conversion and the C4 alkene selectivity for the
seven cycles. The conversion was highly stable when
compared at 5 min, varying only between 21% and
23%. The selectivity for C4 alkenes ranged between
69% and 71%. This indicates that, in the presence of
steam, the catalytic activity could be restored in a re-
generation of 15 min. A short regeneration of 12 min
was not sufficient to restore the activity. However, the
amount of carbon formed on the catalyst during the
dehydrogenation of 15 min was 0.14 wt.% for the first
cycle, but only 0.040.05 wt.%, atomic ratio of C/Mo
0.03, in the next five cycles, indicating that some mi-
nor changes in the catalyst had already taken place
in the first cycle. The XRD pattern of the regenerated
catalyst was similar to that of the fresh one, except for
some decrease in the intensity of the MoO3 lines.
3.6. Influence of the support
The catalytic activity of the MoO3/SiC catalyst was
compared with that of the catalysts supported on alu-
mina and silica under the same conditions. The results
of the test runs are collected in Table 1.
Although the alumina supported catalyst was clearly
the most active, the dehydrogenation selectivity was
very low. At the same conversion level, the SiC sup-
ported catalyst was the most selective towards the for-

mation of C4 alkenes, and carbon content on the cata-
lyst was the lowest. The isomerisation selectivity and
coke formation were clearly highest on the alumina
supported catalyst, indicating the significance of the
acidity of the support.
Another clear difference was found in the reduction
behaviour: the alumina supported catalyst was rapidly
reduced mainly with hydrogen; hardly any carbon ox-
ides were formed, but the average oxidation state of
molybdenum remained at +5.1. On silica and SiC, the
average oxidation states were close to each other in
value, being +3.7 and +4, respectively.
4. Discussion
4.1. Catalyst modification as a function of time on
stream
After the rapid changes at the beginning of the
run, the catalytic activity and selectivity towards C4
alkenes of the SiC supported molybdenum species re-
mained almost unchanged during a 1 h experiment.
Under the same reaction conditions, the catalytic ac-
tivity of the unsupported molybdenum oxide catalyst
decreased rapidly as a function of time on stream. Sup-
porting the molybdenum oxide on SiC clearly brought
about a marked improvement. Apparently, the pres-
ence of the support stabilises the active phase against
sintering for a drastic loss in surface area occurred dur-
ing the reaction with the unsupported catalyst [11,12].
No decrease in the surface area was found with the
supported catalyst, but instead, a slight increase, pos-
sibly because of surface modification by carbonaceous
species.
The rapid changes at the beginning of the reaction
were due to the reduction of the molybdenum species,
as seen in the product distribution and the XRD mea-
surements of the spent catalysts. These findings indi-
cate that the average oxidation state of the bulk molyb-
denum oxide during the stable operation is +4, but this
does not exclude other oxidation states on the surface
of the catalyst. The presence of both hydrogen and
steam was required for the formation of the most ac-
tive and stable phase, and the amount of steam was
critical. The activity of the catalyst remained fairly
constant as long as the balance between the reduc-

tion and oxidation was maintained by the presence of
hydrocarbon, hydrogen and steam [22]. As soon as
the oxygen source was switched off, the carbide-like
phase was formed. This phase exhibited high activity
towards cracking but low dehydrogenation selectivity.
The main side reactions during the stable operation
were cracking to C1C3 hydrocarbons and the forma-
tion of carbon monoxide. If the CO formed after the
fast reduction period had been due only to the fur-
ther reduction of molybdenum oxides, molybdenum
should have existed in a much lower oxidation state
than +4 after a reaction time of 1 h or longer. This was
not the case. Furthermore, there was less water in the
product than in the feed, indicating that a part of the
water had been converted.
It is interesting to observe that the formation of
carbon monoxide closely followed that of methane
(Fig. 8), and in both cases, formation depended on
the amount of water present. More cracking and coke
formation, as well as an increase in CO production,
occurred with smaller amounts of water.
There are several reactions that can lead to the for-
mation of CO. According to thermodynamic calcula-
tions, steam reforming of n-butane to CO is possible
under the conditions applied. Water also regulates the
reduction of molybdenum oxide and removes the coke
and the carbidic phase formed on the surface. The
most likely scenario involves the formation of carbidic
species if the amount of steam in the feed is too low.
The carbidic species, that catalyse cracking reactions,
will be formed and will react with water to yield CO
and H2.

Fig. 9. Influence of regeneration on the activity of the MoOx/SiC catalyst at 560C and WHSV 2 h1.
Some carbon was deposited on the catalyst. The
TPO results showed, in fact, the presence of several
kinds of carbon, but the total amount was small ac-
cording to both TPO and regeneration measurements.
The failure of XRD to reveal diffraction lines cor-
responding to the expected molybdenum oxycarbide
phase seen after the treatment at 350C by XRD [9,10]
can be attributed to the presence of this phase on
only the uppermost layer of the catalyst or in pseudo-
amorphous form. A similar lack of diffraction lines
was reported by Delporte et al. [25] in investigations
on the same catalytic system. The high reaction tem-
perature used in our study, along with the high con-
centration of hydrogen, probably pushed the reduction
process towards the formation of MoO2 rather than to
reduction-carburization, which at lower temperatures
would have led to the formation of molybdenum oxy-
carbide.
The active molybdenum phase was probably com-
posed of reduced molybdenum oxide modified with
carbon and limited to the uppermost layer of the cat-
alyst. The phase formed during the first minutes on
stream was stable and no major structural modifica-
tion occurred. In addition to the support, the stability
can be attributed to the presence of steam in the re-
actant feed, which allowed the oxygen balance on the
surface phase to be preserved. The slight deactivation
observed as a minor decrease in the total conversion
was likely due to site blocking with carbon as the
amount of carbon was gradually increased with time
on stream as shown by TPO analysis.
4.2. Influence of the catalyst support
A clear difference was found in the activity of the
catalysts on the three supports. Selectivity for dehy-
drogenation was best with the SiC supported catalyst.
Partially reduced molybdenum oxide modified with
carbon on the top layer of the catalyst appears to be
the active site.
As is evident from the XRD diffractograms (Fig.
1), the molybdenum species on alumina have a struc-
ture different from those on SiC and SiO2. The struc-
ture on alumina is reduced with difficulty, as is seen
in the TPR spectrum and in the estimate of the oxida-
tion state. Apparently, the strong interaction between
the highly dispersed molybdenum oxide and alumina
hindered the formation of the active phase [9]. The
active phase formed on the silica supported catalyst
probably contained more carbon (carbide-like phase),
which resulted in a non-selective catalyst [12].
5. Conclusions
Molybdenum oxide supported on SiC was shown
to be an active and stable catalyst for the dehydro-
genation of n-butane. The selectivity for C4 alkenes
was higher on this catalyst than on the corresponding
alumina and silica supported catalysts. The pres-
ence of both hydrogen and water was required for
the formation of the active phase, which probably
was composed of molybdenum oxide modified with

carbon and limited to the uppermost layer of the
catalyst.
Even though this new catalyst system is active and
selective in the dehydrogenation reaction, its perfor-
mance is limited by the thermodynamic equilibrium
under the conditions used for testing. Some further im-
provements are needed before it is ready for industrial
use. Our research is continuing.
