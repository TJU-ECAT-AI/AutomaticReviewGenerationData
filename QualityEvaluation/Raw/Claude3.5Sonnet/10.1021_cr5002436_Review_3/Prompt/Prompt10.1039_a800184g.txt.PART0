Gallium oxide is found to be an effective catalyst for the
dehydrogenation of ethane to ethene in the presence of
carbon dioxide at 650 C, giving 18.6% ethene yield with a
selectivity of 94.5%.
Ethene is predominantly produced by steam cracking of
naphtha, ethane or liquid petroleum gas at high temperatures at
short residence time.
In order to reduce energy consumption of ethene production,
oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane is proposed [eqn. (1)].
C2H6 + 1/2O2 ? C2H4 + H2O
(1)
The reaction becomes exothermic and thermodynamically
could be possible at relatively low temperatures. However, it is
necessary to remove heat from the reaction and to avoid over
oxidation to CO2 to give high selectivity towards ethene.
Recently, a great variety of catalysts have been developed and
tested for this reaction.13 In the oxidative dehydrogenation of
propane, Burch and Crabb4 pointed out that thermal non-
catalytic oxidative cracking of propane proceeded to give
propene in the same yield as compared to catalyzed runs which
were operated about 50 C lower than that of non-catalyzed
runs. This suggests that catalyzed oxidative dehydrogenation of
lower alkanes is not highly superior to thermal oxidative
pyrolysis.
Recently, several attempts have been made to use carbon
dioxide as an oxidant for coupling of methane,5 dehydrogena-
tion of ethylbenzene6 or propane.7 However, the role of CO2 in
these reactions is still not clear. In addition, the effects of CO2
on the conversion and yield of the product are not significant.
Here, we study the dehydrogenation of ethane to ethene over
several metal oxide catalysts, and we have found that CO2
markedly promoted dehydrogenation of ethane over Ga2O3
catalyst.
The catalysts used were commercially available MgO, Al2O3,
SiO2, CaO, TiO2, V2O5, Cr2O3, Mn3O4, Fe3O4, ZnO, Ga2O3,
Y2O3, ZrO2, Nb2O5, MoO3, In2O3, SnO2, La2O3, CeO2, Ta2O5
and Tl2O3. The reaction was carried out with a fixed-bed flow
type quartz reactor (i.d. 10 3 350 mm) at atmospheric pressure.
Using 200 mg of a catalyst, 5 ml min21 of C2H6 and 25 ml
min21 of CO2 were introduced. The runs were conducted for 30
min and products were analyzed by gas chromatography.
Fig. 1 shows ethene yields on the various metal oxide
catalysts. Thermal dehydrogenation occurred to give only 2.3%
of ethene yield. Equilibrium conversion of ethane to ethene is
ca. 50% at 650 C at a C2H6Ar (or CO2) ratio of 1:5. MgO,
CaO, SiO2, Ta2O5, Al2O3, SnO2, MoO3, and Tl2O3 did not show
any catalytic activity while CeO2, Nb2O5, Fe3O4, and ZrO2
exhibited only slight catalytic activity. The order of the activity
of oxides at the reaction temperature of 650  C was as follows:
Ga2O3 > Cr2O3 > V2O5 > TiO2 > Mn3O4 > In2O3 > ZnO
> La2O3. The C2H4 selectivities in all the metal oxide catalysts
were > 85% in the dehydrogenation of ethane in the presence of
CO2. As expected, Cr2O3 and V2O5 exhibited high activities.
These catalysts are known to be active catalysts for dehydroge-
nation of alkanes. Ga2O3 afforded the highest yield of ethene
(18.6%) amongst the various metal oxide catalysts. However,
little work has dealt with Ga2O3 catalyst in the dehydrogenation
of propane.8
Table 1 lists ethene yields on Ga2O3, Cr2O3, and V2O5
catalysts in the presence and absence of CO2. The activity of the
Ga2O3 catalyst in the presence of CO2 was twice that in the
absence of CO2. Dehydrogenation of C2H6 in the presence of
CO2 over Ga2O3 catalyst produced mainly C2H4, CO, H2 and
H2O. The yield of ethene with the Cr2O3 catalyst in the presence
of CO2 was slightly higher as compared to the run in Ar. The
promoting effect of CO2 in the dehydrogenation of C3H8 on
Cr2O3/SiO2 has been reported,5 but the increase in the propene
yield was only 2.6% at 550 C. On the other hand, the effect of

CO2 on the yield of ethane with V2O5 in the presence of CO2
was slightly detrimental. CO2 promoted dehydrogenation of
ethane exclusively over Ga2O3 catalyst. To our knowledge,
such a marked promotion effect of CO2 in a hydrocarbon
conversion process has never been previously observed. The
role of CO2 in dehydrogenation of C2H6 over Ga2O3 catalyst is,
as yet, unclear. With CO2 considerable amounts of CO and H2O
were formed during the reaction, indicating reaction of CO2
with H2. The amount of H2O was 1.09 mmol and that of CO was
1.07 mmol at 650 C after 0.5 h. Dehydrogenation of C2H6 was
strongly inhibited when Ga2O3 was impregnated onto a basic
oxide such as MgO or La2O3. Another characteristic feature in
the reaction in CO2 is the increase in the yield of CH4. From
these findings the role of CO2 may be as follows: slightly acidic
CO2 may strongly adsorb onto basic sites of gallium oxide, and
as a result, the acidity of Ga2O3 would be enhanced. This
possibility is reinforced by the fact that after dehydrogenation a
certain amount of carbon was formed on the catalyst (Ga2O3,
Cr2O3, and V2O5). Dehydrogenation of ethane would be
catalyzed by acid sites on Ga2O3.
