Abstract
Supported vanadium oxide catalysts are active in a wide range of applications. In this review, an overview is given of the
current knowledge available about vanadium oxide-based catalysts. The review starts with the importance of vanadium in
heterogeneous catalysis, a discussion of the molecular structure of vanadium in water and in the solid state and an overview of
the spectroscopic techniques enabling to study the chemistry of supported vanadium oxides. In the second part, it will be shown
that advanced spectroscopic tools can be used to obtain detailed information about the coordination environment and oxidation
state of vanadium oxides during each stage of the life-span of a heterogeneous catalyst. Three topics will be discussed: (1)
the molecular structure of supported vanadium oxide catalysts under hydrated, dehydrated and reduced conditions, including
the parameters, which influence the molecular structures formed at the surface of the support oxide; (2) elucidation of the
active surface vanadium oxide during the oxidation of methanol to formaldehyde, the reaction mechanism and the vanadium
oxidesupport effect; and (3) deactivation of fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) catalysts by migration of vanadium oxides and
the development of a method preventing the structural breakdown of zeolites by trapping the mobile vanadium oxides in an
aluminum oxide coating.

1. Introduction
Vanadium was discovered in 1801 in Mexico by the
Spanish mineralogist A.M. del Rio, who considered
it to be present in a particular brownish lead mineral
[13]. He named the new element erythronium. How-
ever, the French chemist H.V. Collet-Descotils incor-
rectly declared that this new element was only impure
chromium. Later on, in 1830, the Swedish chemist
N.G. Sefstrm rediscovered the element and named
it in honor of Vanadis, the old Norse name for the

Scandinavian goddess Freyjaa fertility goddess
because of its beautiful multicolored compounds. In
1831, vanadium was unambiguously identified as the
originally named erythronium element of del Rio
and the lead mineral is now known as vanadinite
(Pb5(VO4)3Cl).
Vanadium is one of the most abundant and widely
distributed metals in the earths crust and is found
in about 152 different minerals, in certain iron ores
and also in the form of organic complexes in some
crude oils, e.g. Vporphyrin complexes [4,5]. The ma-
jor sources of vanadium are titaniferrous magnetite
ores from mines in Australia, China, Russia and South
Africa. The current level of the annual production of
vanadium in the world is 38,000 tonnes. About 80%

of the vanadium produced is used as steel additive,
as it makes steel shock- and vibration-resistant. Vana-
dium is also an essential element in aerospace indus-
try, as it guarantees low density, high strength and
resistance to high operating temperatures and stress.
Titaniumaluminumvanadium alloys are used in, e.g.
aero-engine gas turbines and in the undercarriages of
planes. Other uses of vanadium are in ceramics and
electronics. Vanadium salts are well known for the
brilliant orange and blue colors in ceramics or in dyes
for textiles and leather.
The most dominant non-metallurgical use of vana-
dium is in catalysis, which represents about 5% of the
annual production of vanadium. Table 1 summarizes
some industrial catalytic processes based on vanadium
oxides. Vanadium oxide-based catalysts are used in
the manufacture of important chemicals (e.g. sulfuric
acid, phthalic anhydride) and in the reduction of en-
vironmental pollution (e.g. nitrogen oxides from flue
gas of power plants) and is the most important metal
used in metal oxide catalysis [613]. The importance
of vanadium in supported metal oxide catalysis is fur-
ther underlined by Fig. 1. This figure summarizes the
number of papers (expressed as a percentage of the
total number of papers) of several transition metals in
the field of metal oxide catalysis, which can be found
in the open literature [14].
Most catalysts based on vanadium oxide consist of
a vanadium oxide phase deposited on the surface of an
oxide support, such as SiO2, Al2O3, TiO2 and ZrO2.
Supporting a metal oxide on the surface of another
oxide was initially proposed to improve the catalytic
activity of the active metal oxide phase due to a gain
in surface area and mechanical strength [7,15]. The
support was considered as inert substance that pro-
vided a high surface to carry the active metal oxide

component or to improve the mechanical strength of
the catalyst material. However, during the last decade
catalyst scientists have unambiguously shown that the
activity and selectivity of supported metal oxide cata-
lysts are significantly affected by the properties of the
support oxide material. This is generally known as the
metal oxidesupport effect, although its exact origin
and mechanism of operation is still unclear.
The fundamental basis for the catalytic perfor-
mances of supported vanadium oxides lies in the
variability in geometric and electronic structure of
surface vanadium oxides. Fundamental knowledge
about the chemistry of supported vanadium oxides
is of key importance in heterogeneous catalysis and
spectroscopic tools are necessary to built up this
knowledge. In this review paper, the fundamental ad-
vances into the surface chemistry and spectroscopy
of vanadium oxides in heterogeneous catalysts of the
last decade are emphasized. No exhaustive discussion
of all the catalytic applications of supported vanadium
oxides available in the open literature will be given
(Table 2) [1659]. Rather, we want to develop fun-
damental concepts, which explain the differences in
chemistry of supported vanadium oxides during each
stage of the life-span of a heterogeneous catalyst, i.e.
synthesis, calcination, activation, catalytic operation
and deactivation. The review paper starts with a short
introduction on the molecular structures of vanadium
oxides in water and in the solid state. In the second
part, several spectroscopic methods for the character-
ization of supported vanadium oxides are discussed,
together with their potential and limitations. The
third part deals with an overview of the methods for
preparing supported vanadium oxide catalysts. The
