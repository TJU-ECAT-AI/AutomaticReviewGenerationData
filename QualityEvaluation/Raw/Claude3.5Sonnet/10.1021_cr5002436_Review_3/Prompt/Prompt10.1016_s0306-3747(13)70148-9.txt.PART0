I'm going to give you a scientific literature. Then I'm going to ask you some questions about it. I'd like you to first write down exact quotes of parts of the document word by word that would help answer the question, and then I'd like you to answer the question using facts from the quoted content. Do not omit any relevant information from the text, and avoid introducing any falsehoods or assumptions that aren't directly supported by the literature.

and ground calcium carbonate in Asia Pacific, 
Latin America and the Middle East.
Calcium carbonate finds extensive use as functional 
and commercial fillers in plastics, paper, rubber, coatings, 
light chemicals and architectural materials, among others. 
The dynamics of the global market are closely linked to 
trends in the paper, automotive, plastics and construc-
tion industries, which are significantly affected by cyclical 
fluctuations of the global economy, GIA observes. CaCO3 
consumption therefore declined during the economic 
uncertainties of the recession years. In particular, the 
demand for precipitated CaCO3 (PCC) fell drastically 
owing to the steep decline in paper output in the USA 
and Europe. However, the market is expected to make 
steady recovery and post growth in the long run. 
Asia Pacific represents the largest and fastest-growing region-
al market for CaCO3, with the rapid progress of its plastics 
and paper industries expected to drive future growth. China, 
in particular, is expected to remain a major contributor to 
growth. On the other hand, the CaCO3 market in developed 
regions is expected to grow at a relatively moderate pace.
Ground CaCO3 (GCC) represents the largest and fast-
est-growing product segment in the global market, GIA 
finds. While the demand for GCC from Asian countries 
is expected to be robust, North America and Europe are 
forecast to register lacklustre growth. GCC is commonly 
used as a filler in the plastics industry while in the paper- 
making sector, GCC continues to generate demand in 
both coating and filler applications. Growth in the PCC 
market will also be driven by the increasing number of 
paper mills and rising demand from the plastics sector. 
Asia Pacific offers huge opportunities for growth, with 
Chinas surging domestic demand for paints and plastics 
in the construction industry. Increasing consumption of 
PCC in the paper and rubber industries is also expected 
to offer favourable opportunities in China. In North 
America and Europe, the establishment of satellite plants 
augurs well for the PCC market, according to GIA.
The report provides a comprehensive review of mar-
ket trends, issues, drivers, company profiles and strategic 
industry activities. It offers market estimates and projec-
tions for the major geographic markets, and detailed 
analysis of the GCC and PCC product segments and their 
end-use markets. Key players profiled in the report include 
Excalibar Minerals, Huber Engineered Materials, Imerys, 
Maruo Calcium Minerals Technologies, Mississippi Lime 
Company, Okutama Kogyo, Omya, Schaefer Kalk and 
Solvay. The 399-page report costs US$4500.

Ceresana forecasts dynamic 
growth for carbon black market
G
lobal demand for carbon black is expected to 
rise dynamically until 2019, according to a new 
market study from Ceresana Research. By 2019, 
market volume is expected to increase by more 
than 3.1 million tonnes from 2011 levels. The major 
share of consumption is in the production of tyres 
of all sorts; this segment consumed >7.8 million 
tonnes in 2011. Carbon black is used as a filler in 
tyres and numerous rubber products. In other indus-
trial sectors such as plastics, paints, varnishes and 
printing inks, carbon black is used as a pigment. 
The automotive industry is the largest sales market for 
carbon black. Its development is decisive for both the tyre 
segment as well as the utilization of a wide range of rubber 
products. On average, manufacturers of carbon black have 
been able to profit from the sound development of the auto-
motive market in the past eight years. Global production of 
passenger cars rose from 42 million units in 2003 to almost 
60 million units in 2011, with utility vehicles adding a fur-
ther 20 million units that year. In 2010 the global stock of 
all vehicles surpassed the 1 billion mark for the first time.
Unsurprisingly, Asia Pacific is found to be the main driv-
er for growth; consumption and production volumes in this 
region are both expected to increase by more than 4.5% 
per annum. China dominates the market, single-handedly 
consuming >30% of the total global carbon black market 
volume. As a result of massive expansions in capacity, this 
region will become a net exporter in the future.
Production costs and prices of carbon black are mainly 
influenced by the prices for raw materials and vary greatly 
due to fluctuating prices for crude oil. The increase of the 
average global price for crude oil from US$27/barrel in 
2003 to >$108/barrel in 2011 caused carbon black prices 
to rise by almost 130% in the same period. Pressure 
on margins is forecast to continue for manufacturers of 
carbon black. Accordingly, further consolidation among 
manufacturers and a localization of production in indi-
vidual countries is expected, Ceresana reports.
In addition to detailed analysis of the carbon black 
market by region/country and application area, including

ASTM announces standard for 
identification & qualification  
of phthalates in PVC
I
n the USA, section 108 of the Consumer Product 
Safety Improvement Act of 2008 (CPSIA) prohib-
its certain products from containing six specified 
phthalates. A new ASTM International stand-
ard under the jurisdiction of Committee D20 on 
Plastics provides a method for the identification 
and qualification of these phthalates.
The new standard, ASTM D7823, Test Method for 
Determination of Low Level, Regulated Phthalates in Poly 
(Vinyl Chloride) Plastics by Thermal Desorption  Gas 
Chromatography/Mass Chromatography, was developed by 
Subcommittee D20.70 on Analytical Methods. The six 
phthalates covered by the standard are: DBP
, 1,2-ben-
zenedicarboxylicacid; BBP
, benzyl butyl phthalate; 
DEHP
, bis(2-ethyhexyl) phthalate; DNOP
, di(n-dioctyl) 
phthalate; DINP
, 1,2-benzenedicarboxylicacid, di-C8-10-
branched alkyl esters; and DIDP
, 1,2-benzenedicarboxyli-
cacid, di-C9-11-branched alkyl esters. Phthalates are used 
as plasticizers for a variety of polymers, including rubber 
and nitrocellulose.
Analytical laboratories, regulatory bodies and manu-
facturers will all use ASTM D7823 to determine wheth-
er a product meets the requirements of Section 108 of 
the CPSIA law. Childrens toys and child care articles 
that can be placed in the mouth are among the products 
covered by ASTM D7823 and the CPSIA. In addition 
to CPSIA, other regulations on these phthalates include 
the European Union Directive 2005/84/EC and Japans 
Health, Labor and Welfare Ministry Guideline No. 336 
(2010).
Subcommittee D20.70 invites participation in its on-
going development of ASTM D7823 and other stand-
ards. The committee plans on doing a precision and bias 
inter-laboratory study for the thermal desorption gas 
chromatography/mass spectrometry method described 
in ASTM D7823. The subcommittee will also start on a 
solvent extraction gas chromatography/mass spectrometry 
method, as well as create an adjunct GC/MS plasticizer 
library for the methods. Commercial plasticizer samples 
for the library would be useful in D20.70s efforts, ASTM 
International comments.
