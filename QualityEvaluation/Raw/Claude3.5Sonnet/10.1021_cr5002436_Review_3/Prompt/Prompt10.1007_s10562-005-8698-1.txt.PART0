The dehydration of ethanol into ethylene was investigated over various solid acid catalysts, such as zeolites and silicaalumina,
at temperatures ranging 453573 K under atmospheric pressure. Ethylene was produced via diethyl ether during the dehydration
process. H-mordenites were the most active for the dehydration. It was suggested that the catalyst activity could be correlated with
the number of strong Brnsted acid sites in the catalyst. Further, the H-mordenite was more stable with a SiO2/Al2O3 ratio of 90
than with a SiO2/Al2O3 ratio of 20.
KEY WORDS: dehydration; ethanol; ethylene; solid acid.
1. Introduction
In recent times, the reduction of CO2 emission has
become a crucial problem in the chemical industry. The
utilization of ethanol from biomass fermentation instead
of petroleum as chemical feedstock may facilitate the
reduction of CO2 emission. Therefore, the authors have
focused attention on the catalytic conversion of ethanol.
At present, the authors are studying the dehydration of
ethanol into ethylene. It is well known that this dehy-
dration is catalyzed by various solid acid catalysts such
as silicaalumina and zeolites [17].
In the present study, the dehydration of ethanol into
ethylene was investigated over various solid acid cata-
lysts such as zeolite and silicaalumina. First, in order to
select highly active catalysts, the catalytic activities of
various solid acid catalysts were compared at tempera-
tures ranging from 453 to 573 K. Next, the relationship
between the catalyst activity and the acid sites on the
catalyst was discussed based on the results of tempera-
ture-programmed desorption of ammonia (NH3-TPD)
and
diffuse
reflectance
infrared
Fourier
transform
spectroscopy (DRIFTS) studies. Furthermore, changes
in the activities of several selected catalysts with time on
stream were examined from a practical viewpoint, and
the amount of carbonaceous deposits on the catalysts
during the dehydration was measured.
2. Experimental
The solid acid catalysts used in the present study were
H-mordenites (JRC-Z-HM20(4) and JRC-Z-HM90(2)),
H-ZSM5
zeolites
(JRC-Z5-25H
and
JRC-Z5-90H),
H-beta-zeolite (JRC-Z-HB25(1)), H-Y zeolite (JRC-Z-
HY5.5), and silicaalumina (JRC-SAL-2), which were
the reference catalysts supplied by Catalysis Society of
Japan. In the present paper, the symbols HM20, HM90,
HZSM5-25, HZSM5-90, HB25, HY5.5, and SA repre-
sent JRC-Z-HM20(4), JRC-Z-HM90(2), JRC-Z5-25H,
JRC-Z5-90H,
JRC-Z-HB25(1),
JRC-Z-HY5.5,
and
JRC-SAL-2, respectively. The molar ratios of SiO2 to
Al2O3
in
HM20,
HM90,
HZSM5-25,
HZSM5-90,
HB25, HY5.5, and SA were 18.9, 90, 25, 90, 25, 5.6, and
9.2, respectively. The solid acid catalysts were used as
received for the dehydration process.
The dehydration was carried out in a fixed-bed flow
reactor
under
atmospheric
pressure.
Pure
ethanol
(99.5%) obtained from Nacalai Tesque Inc. was used as
received. The temperature of the catalyst fixed in the
reactor was raised to the reaction temperature in a flow
of He. Ethanol was then fed into the reactor along with
He. The reaction products were analyzed by FID gas
chromatographs that were directly connected to the
reactor. The products of the dehydration were ethylene,
diethyl ether, small amounts of ethane, acetaldehyde,
propene, and butenes. The yield of each product was
defined as the conversion of ethanol to the products, and
the selectivity to each product was defined as its yield
divided by the total conversion of ethanol.
The amount of carbonaceous deposits on the post-
reaction catalyst was measured by TG/DTA.
In order to characterize the acid sites on the solid acid
catalysts, NH3-TPD measurements of the catalysts and
DRIFTS studies on pyridine adsorbed on their acid sites
were carried out.
The NH3-TPD measurements were carried out under
atmospheric pressure using a TPD apparatus connected
to a mass spectrometer (Microvision from Leda-Mass

Ltd.). Approximately 150 mg of the catalyst sample was
treated in a sample tube at 773 K for 1 h in a flow of He.
The temperature was reduced to 373 K, and the sample
was placed in a flow of a gas mixture of NH3(10)/He(90)
for 1 h and then in the flow of He (30 ml/min) for 1.5 h.
The effluent gas at the outlet of the sample tube was
analyzed with the mass spectrometer while the sample
was heated to 773 K at a rate of 10 K/min. The signals
of m/e= 16, 17, 18, and 28 were simultaneously moni-
tored. Since the signal of m/e= 17 might originate from
both NH3 and H2O, the signal of m/e=16 was consid-
ered to indicate the presence of NH3 in the effluent gas.
The DRIFTS studies on pyridine adsorbed on the
acid sites of the catalyst were carried out using an FT-IR
spectrometer (JIR-6500 from JEOL Ltd.) equipped with
an MCT detector and a diffuse reflectance cell (Catalytic
DRIFT Chamber from Spectra-Tech Inc.); the cell was
used to obtain the diffuse reflectance spectra at a reso-
lution of 4 cm)1. The powder catalyst sample placed in
the cell was treated in a flow of Ar at 623 K for 30 min.
Pyridine was then adsorbed on it by passing Ar through
a pyridine container at room temperature and the
sample cell at 423 K for 30 min. The sample on which
pyridine was adsorbed was treated at 623 K in a flow of
Ar for 1 h to remove the pyridine that was weakly
adsorbed on the sample. The diffuse reflectance spectra
of the adsorbed pyridine were recorded at 623 K in a
flow of Ar.
3. Results and discussion
Figure 1 shows the conversion of ethanol and the
selectivity to products such as ethylene and diethyl ether
as a function of W/F during the dehydration over
HM90. The result clearly indicates that ethylene is
produced via diethyl ether. In the present study, the
yield of ethylene was considered as a measure of the
catalyst activity during the dehydration.
Table 1 shows the activities of various solid acid
catalysts for the dehydration of ethanol into ethylene. It
can be observed that the catalyst activity decreases in the
following order: HM20>HM90>ZSM5-25>HB25>
ZSM5-90>HY5.5>SA.
NH3-TPD measurements and DRIFTS studies were
carried out in order to clarify the relationship between
the catalyst activity and the number of acid sites on the
solid acid catalysts.
Figure 2 shows the NH3-TPD profiles of several solid
acid catalysts. The profile and amount of NH3 desorbed
from the catalyst can be considered as the acid strength
distribution and the number of acid sites on the catalyst,

including both the Brnsted and Lewis acid sites,
respectively. The amount of NH3 desorbed from all the
catalysts with the exception of SA at temperatures greater
than 823 K reduces in the same order as the catalyst
activity, as shown above. Therefore, it is suggested that
the strong acid sites from which NH3 could be desorbed
at temperatures greater than 823 K should be necessary
for the dehydration of ethanol into ethylene.
Figure 3 shows the DRIFTS profiles of pyridine
adsorbed at 473 K on several solid acid catalysts. It is
well known that the absorption bands at 1545 and
1455 cm)1 are assigned to the adsorbed pyridinium ions
and pyridine coordinated to the Lewis acid sites,
respectively. The percentage of Brnsted acid sites in the
total number of acid sites (Brnsted acid sites+Lewis
acid sites) on each solid acid catalyst was estimated from
the integrated peak areas of the two absorption bands of
the catalyst [8]. The percentage of Brnsted acid sites on
HM20, HM90, ZSM5-25, ZSM5-90, HB25, HY5.5, and
SA were estimated to be 83%, 95%, 94%, 92%, 33%,
83%, and 50%, respectively. As described above, the
amount of NH3 desorbed from SA at temperatures
greater than 823 K was higher than that from HY,
whereas the catalytic activity of SA was lower than that
of HY. Since the percentage of the Brnsted acid sites
on HY was higher than that on SA by 65%, it is sug-
gested that the Brnsted acid sites are active sites for the
dehydration of ethanol into ethylene. Accordingly, the
results strongly suggest that the catalyst activity during
the dehydration process should be correlated with the
number of strong Brnsted acid sites where NH3 could
be desorbed at temperatures greater than 823 K in the
present TPD experiments. In other words, the strong
Brnsted acid sites should be the active sites for the
dehydration of ethanol into ethylene.
The H-mordenites were more active than the other
solid acid catalysts tested, as shown in Table 1. The
changes in the activities of HM20 and HM90 with time
on stream during the dehydration of ethanol at 453 K
were examined from a practical viewpoint, as shown in
figure 4. Although the conversion of ethanol was almost
constant during its dehydration over HM20 for 40 h, the
selectivity to ethylene gradually decreased, while that to
diethyl ether gradually increased with time on stream
20 h after the reaction began. On the other hand, both
the conversion of ethanol and the selectivities to ethyl-
ene and diethyl ether were almost constant during the
dehydration over HM90 for 40 h. Since the accumula-
tion of carbonaceous deposits on the catalyst is con-
sidered to be one of the causes of catalyst deactivation,
as suggested by previous studies [6,7], the amount of
carbonaceous deposits on the post-reaction catalysts
was measured. The amount of carbonaceous deposits on
HM20 was 6 mg-C/g-cat, while that on HM90 was too
low to be measured. These findings suggest that, in
practice, HM90 is more suitable than HM20 for the
dehydration of ethanol into ethylene.
4. Conclusions
(1) The dehydration of ethanol into ethylene was
investigated over various solid acid catalysts such as
zeolites and silicaalumina at temperatures ranging
from 453 to 573 K under atmospheric pressure.
Ethylene was produced via diethyl ether during the
dehydration process. H-mordenites were the most
active for the dehydration.
