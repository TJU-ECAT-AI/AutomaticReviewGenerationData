1. Introduction
The importance of catalytic dehydrogenation of paraffins to
olefins
has
been
growing
due
to
the
demand
for
these
unsaturated hydrocarbons. Light olefins, such as butenes, are
essential raw materials used to obtain polymers, gasoline
additives and other chemical products. Butenes can be obtained
in plants of n-butane catalytic dehydrogenation, as secondary
products in steam cracking and catalytic cracking units, among
other processes. Catalytic dehydrogenation of paraffins is a
selective method to produce alkenes. However, the conversion
of paraffins to the corresponding olefins is limited by thermo-
dynamics restrictions due to the strong endothermic character
of the reaction. High temperatures (530730 8C) are required to
reach conversions of nearly 50% for paraffins C2C6 [1]. The
dehydrogenation temperatures are higher for light paraffins
than for heavy ones. Consequently, lateral reactions of cracking
to lighter hydrocarbons and coking are favored at these high
temperatures, causing a decrease in the selectivity towards
desired products.
Alumina-supported
Pt
catalysts
have
been
used
in
the
dehydrogenation of light paraffins, being very active but little
selective and strongly deactivated by the formation of coke. For
this reason, the catalytic stability and selectivity of this system can
be improved with the incorporation of a second metal, such as Sn
[2,3]. A catalytic system based on Pd can be an alternative to the
more expensive metals, such as Pt. The use of Pd/Al2O3 catalysts for
the dehydrogenation of a hydrocarbon was first reported in 1973 to
produce benzene from cyclohexane [4]. Recently, the dehydro-
genation of propane was used to study supported Pd catalysts,
which without modifications presented the same problems
mentioned for Pt/Al2O3 catalysts, and the addition of a second
metal (Sn) improved the catalytic properties of these systems [5].
In literature, it has been reported an enhancement in the selectivity
towards propylene when Ga is added to Pt/Al2O3 catalysts [3] and
ZSM-5 zeolites [6].
The objective of this work is to study the effects of the addition
of Ga and calcination treatment on the catalytic behavior of Pd/
Al2O3
catalysts
in
the
n-butane
dehydrogenation
reaction.
Catalysts were characterized by X-ray fluorescence spectroscopy
(XRF), N2 adsorption, temperature programmed reduction (TPR),
CO and H2 chemisorptions and O2/H2 titrations.

Dehydrogenation of n-butane over alumina-supported Pd and PdGa catalysts was studied. Catalysts
were prepared by incipient wetness impregnation with a Pd content of 0.66 wt% and atomic Ga/Pd ratios
from 0 to 1, using aqueous solutions of PdCl2 and Ga(NO3)3. Fresh (uncalcined) and calcined catalysts
were characterized by X-ray fluorescence spectroscopy (XRF), N2 adsorption, temperature programmed
reduction (TPR), CO and H2 chemisorptions and O2/H2 titrations. n-Butane dehydrogenation reaction
was carried out at 500 8C, atmospheric pressure and a H2/C4H10 ratio of 10. An increase in the Pd
dispersion with increasing Ga content was observed for the fresh catalysts, according to CO
chemisorption results. H2 chemisorption and H2/O2 titrations were not reliable methods to determine
the Pd dispersion in the fresh catalysts. For the calcined catalysts with low Ga contents, the CO/Pd, H/Pd
and O/Pd values were very similar, but different for those with the higher Ga contents. These differences
were explained based on the presence of chlorine. Coke deposition produced the deactivation of the
catalysts and inhibited hydrogenolysis reactions on Pd, favoring the dehydrogenation selectivity. In the
fresh catalysts, the Ga addition caused an effect similar to that produced by coke, reducing the activity
and increasing the dehydrogenation selectivity. In the calcined catalysts, the effect of Ga addition on
activity was diminished by the calcination treatment. The combination of calcination and high Ga
content led to a catalyst with enhanced activity and very high dehydrogenation selectivity.

2. Experimental
2.1. Catalyst preparation and characterization
The monometallic Pd/Al2O3 and Ga/Al2O3 catalysts were
prepared by incipient wetness impregnation of g-Al2O3 (supplied
by IFP) with a hydrochloric solution of PdCl2 (>99%, Fisher) and an
aqueous solution of Ga(NO3)3xH2O (>99.9%, Alfa), respectively.
The wet solids were dried at 70 8C in a rotavapor and then at 120 8C
overnight in a furnace. Before impregnation, the g-Al2O3 support
(60/80 mesh) was calcined at 700 8C for 2 h. The bimetallic PdGa/
Al2O3 catalysts were prepared by impregnation of the Pd/Al2O3
catalyst with the appropriate amounts of an aqueous solution of
Ga(NO3)3xH2O to obtain Ga/Pd atomic ratios of 0.2, 0.5, 1 and 2.
The catalyst samples dried at 120 8C were designated as fresh
catalysts, and those calcined at 550 8C as calcined catalysts.
These designations did not change for the reduced catalysts. The Pd
and Ga contents were measured by energy dispersive X-ray
fluorescence spectroscopy (EDX) using a Shimadzu EDX-700HS
spectrometer. The chemical compositions of the catalysts used in
the present study are given in Table 1, along with the Ga/Pd atomic
ratios.
The BET surface areas of the support and the catalysts were
determined from the N2 adsorption isotherms at 196 8C using an
automatic Micromeritics ASAP 2010 apparatus after the samples
were outgassed at 120 8C overnight. The specific surface areas of all
the catalysts are also listed in Table 1.
TPR experiments were carried out using a stainless steel
apparatus provided with a TCD, using a gaseous mixture of 5% H2/
Ar (Praxair) at a flow of 30 ml/min (reducing gas) and a catalyst
sample of 100 mg. The sample was dried at 120 8C or calcined at
550 8C for 1 h in a flow of air (30 ml/min) and then was cooled to
80 8C using a cold trap (isopropyl alcohol and liquid nitrogen). At
this temperature, the reactor was purged with flowing Ar, and the
TCD signal was stabilized in the flow of the reducing gas before
starting heating. The sample was spontaneously heated from
80 8C to RT by removing the cold trap and then to 700 8C at 10 8C/
min using a furnace.
The
measurements
of
CO
and
H2
chemisorptions
were
determined at RT and 80 8C, respectively, by the pulse method,
using the same TPR apparatus, which was equipped with a gas
injection valve (Valco). The catalyst sample was dried or calcined
as explained before, and then reduced in a flow of H2 (20 ml/min)
at 500 8C for 1 h. Then, the reactor temperature was kept at 300 8C
in an Ar flow (H2 chemisorption) or a He flow (CO chemisorption)
for 30 min to remove the adsorbed hydrogen. The pulses were sent
to the reactor until reaching the saturation. O2/H2 titrations were
carried out after H2 chemisorption at 80 8C. O2 pulses were sent to
the reactor to titrate the chemisorbed hydrogen. Then, H2 pulses
were sent to the reactor to titrate adsorbed oxygen.
2.2. Catalytic activity measurements
The n-butane dehydrogenation reaction was carried out in a
fixed bed reactor at 500 8C and 1 atm under differential conditions.
A feed with a H2/n-C4H10 molar ratio of 10 was used. The catalyst
sample (20 mg) was dried or calcined and reduced, as explained
before. The analyses were performed in a Perkin-Elmer Auto-
System gas chromatograph, equipped with a 0.19% picric acid/
Carbograph packed column and FID detector.
3. Results and discussion
The TPR profiles of the fresh catalysts are shown in Fig. 1. The
monometallic Pd catalyst (Pd(F)) shows a reduction peak at 153 8C,
which is ascribed to the reduction of PdCl2. This assignment differs
from that proposed by Chandra et al. [7], who detected HCl at ca.
150 8C during the TPR run of a fresh Pd/Al2O3 catalyst. They
considered that the reduction of PdCl2 on alumina occurred at
room temperature and the formed HCl appeared to be adsorbed on
alumina surface at lower temperatures and then desorbed at
150 8C. In the present work, no H2 consumption was observed at
temperatures below 150 8C for the mentioned catalyst and,
therefore, the formation and desorption of HCl occurred simulta-
neously at 153 8C as a result of PdCl2 reduction at this temperature.
In order to support this statement, an additional TPR experiment
was carried out using a 0.35%Pd/SiO2 catalyst prepared by
impregnation with a PdCl2 solution. Again, an only reduction
peak also centered at 153 8C was observed, and the H2 consump-
tion (expressed as a H2/Pd ratio) was 1.06, as expected for the
reduction of this Pd salt.
The monometallic Ga catalyst shows a reduction peak at 393 8C
(Fig. 1). This peak can be attributed to the reduction of Ga(NO3)3. In
the fresh PdGa/Al2O3 catalysts, the temperature of the peak
attributed to the PdCl2 reduction increased with the smaller dose
of Ga to 174 8C and then decreased for higher Ga contents up to
131 8C, while the peak intensity increased continuously with the
Ga content. These results can be attributed to the simultaneous
reduction of PdCl2 and Ga(NO3)3, where Pd0 catalytically assisted
the reduction of the Ga salt. An additional catalyst (Pd0.49Ga(F))
was prepared in order to confirm the observed tendencies in the
reduction temperature and peak intensity.
The TPR profiles of calcined catalysts are showed in Fig. 2. The
calcination treatment produced the segregation of the palladium

and gallium oxides since several peaks with different temperatures
were observed. The calcined monometallic Pd catalyst showed a
reduction peak at 18 8C, which has been attributed to the reduction
of crystalline PdO to Pd0 [5], and a peak at 110 8C, which can be
ascribed to the reduction of smaller PdO particles interacting with
the support. A wide particle-size distribution of these PdO particles
is indicated by the great broadness of the last peak. In the
literature, reduction peaks at higher temperatures were associated
with small PdO particles. Finol et al. [8] ascribed a peak at 250 8C to
the reduction of PdO species stabilized strongly by the support.
Lieske and Vo
lter [9] attributed a peak at 300 8C to the reduction of
a surface complex of PdO interacting strongly with the support.
The calcined monometallic Ga/Al2O3 catalyst showed no reduction
peak up to 700 8C, indicating that the Ga2O3 species are reduced at
higher temperatures.
The calcined bimetallic catalysts exhibited two additional
reduction peaks at 316 and 460 8C, which shifted toward lower
temperatures, 290 and 435 8C, respectively, and increased their
intensity by increasing Ga content. The first peak could be due to
the reduction of Ga2O3 species in close proximity with Pd0
particles, and the second one to the reduction of Ga2O3 species
located far from Pd0. In both cases, it is possible that H2 spillover
from the Pd particles initiates Ga2O3 reduction. The Ga2O3 species
were formed during catalyst calcination [10]. The negative peak
attributed to the decomposition of the b-PdHx phase it is not
clearly distinguished in the TPR profiles corresponding to the
calcined catalysts, due to its overlapping with the peak of 110 8C
[11].
Table
2 presents the values of CO/Pd, H/Pd and O/Pd molar
ratios, along with the values of HT/OT and HC/HT molar ratios. In
the fresh catalysts, the CO/Pd values indicate the Pd dispersion was
low for the Pd(F) catalyst and increased with the addition of Ga,
reaching a maximum for the catalyst containing 0.29% Ga, and then
decreased for the catalyst with the higher Ga content (0.72%). This
behavior could be caused by a dispersing effect of the Ga salt at low
contents on Pd, but a very slight blockage of Pd surface could occur
for the highest amount of Ga added to the Pd(F) catalyst. Jablonski
et
al. [3] reported that higher additions of Ga than 0.44% on Pt
catalysts obstructed the Pt sites, producing a diminution in the
adsorption of CO and H2. For the calcined catalyst, the dispersion
was, in general, slightly higher than for the fresh ones. This effect
can be associated to the formation of PdxOyClz species during the
catalyst calcination, and these species are considered as mobile
complexes that spread over alumina surface and improve Pd
dispersion upon reduction [9,12]. Gaspar and Dieguez [12]
detected by FTIR and XPS the formation of such species in calcined
Pd/Al2O3 catalysts prepared with PdCl2. The higher dispersion of
Pd0.72Ga(C) with respect to its fresh counterpart indicates that Pd
and Ga oxides were segregated after calcination as suggested by
TPR results.
For all the fresh catalysts, the values of H/Pd ratio estimated
from H2 chemisorption (HC) were significantly higher than those of
CO/Pd ratio. These differences are attributable neither to the
formation of b-PdHx phase, because hydrogen absorption does not
occur at the used temperature (80 8C) for H2 chemisorption, nor to
the adsorption of H2 on Ga, since the monometallic (Ga-free) Pd
catalyst also presented the same behavior. But, such differences
can be attributed to the reaction of a fraction of the consumed
hydrogen with the Cl species remaining at the metalsupport
interface after reduction and the adsorption of the produced
species (HCl) on the support. This can cause higher H2 consump-
tions than those required for adsorption only. It is known that
alumina support retains chlorides after a reduction treatment at
high
temperatures.
For
example,
the
Cl
contents
of
the
Pd0.29Ga(F) catalyst determined before and after reduction at
500 8C were 0.44 and 0.14 wt%, respectively. Therefore, an amount
of remaining chlorides of 39.5 mmol Cl/gcat can be estimated for
the reduced catalyst, which is high compared to the hydrogen
uptake (HC = 36.0 mmol H/gcat) determined in the HC measure-
ment and to the total amount of Pd (62.0 mmol/gcat) present in the
catalyst. This can suggest that chloride ions present on the surface
of the fresh catalysts could promote an extra H2 consumption,
which would lead to an overestimation of Pd dispersion if a H:Pd
adsorption stoichiometry of 1:1, which has been widely accepted
[13], is assumed.
The presence of Cl in the fresh catalysts also produced very low
values of O/Pd ratio, being considerably smaller than the CO/Pd
values. These low O/Pd ratios do not mean that the Pd surface was
not completely saturated with oxygen, but that the amounts of
adsorbed oxygen (Oads = OT  Oreact) used to calculate such ratios
were underestimated as a result of the overestimation of the
amounts of oxygen that reacted (Oreact = 1/2HC) with hydrogen
pulsed during chemisorption to form water. It was mentioned that
HC values were augmented by the extra H2 consumption, which
reacted with Cl species during hydrogen chemisorption and,
therefore, was not available to react with oxygen pulsed during
subsequent titration. The very low O/Pd ratios mean that extra H2
consumptions were significantly large and led to wrong calcula-
tions of the amount of adsorbed oxygen on Pd.

The effect of Cl can also be appreciable in the low values of HT/
OT ratio (1.21.9) and high values of HC/HT ratio (1), compared
with the theoretical values (2.0 and 0.33, respectively), after
assuming adsorption stoichiometries of H:Pd and O:Pd of 1:1 [13].
The H/Pd values estimated from hydrogen titration (HT) for the
fresh catalysts are lower than those calculated from HC, but even
higher than CO/Pd values. The decrease in the H/Pd ratio observed
in the sequence HC-OT-HT can be due to a diminution in the
amount of hydrogen reacting with Cl ions still present at the
metalsupport interface.
Contrasting with the fresh catalysts, for the calcined catalysts
with the lower Ga contents, the values of CO/Pd, H/Pd and O/Pd
ratios are very similar and, moreover, the values of HT/OT and HC/
HT ratios are very similar to the theoretical ones, obtained after
considering H:Pd and O:Pd adsorption stoichiometries of 1:1 [13].
This could be caused by the complete elimination or strong
diminution in the Cl content in the catalysts after calcination. In
fact, the Cl content determined for Pd(C) and Pd0.16Ga(C)
catalysts was about 0.01 wt% (equivalent to 2.8 mmol Cl/gcat),
which can be considered very low. In consequence, there was not
reaction of the adsorbed hydrogen with Cl species and the
amount of adsorbed oxygen was appropriately estimated. The
similarity among CO/Pd, H/Pd and O/Pd ratios and of HT/OT and
HC/HT ratios to their corresponding theoretical values suggest that
the global CO:Pd adsorption stoichiometry is, in this case, equal to
1:1. The calcined catalysts with the higher Ga contents (>0.16%)
showed, according to CO/Pd and O/Pd values, an increment in the
dispersion, but this is in contradiction with the decrease in H/Pd
ratios, where the corresponding values of HT/OT and HC/HT ratios
are lower than the theoretical values. In this case, the presence of
Ga at higher loadings caused this discrepancy.
The catalytic activity (TOF) of the fresh and calcined catalysts at
500 8C as a function of time on-stream (TOS) are shown in Fig. 3.
The TOF values were estimated based on the CO chemisorption
results, assuming CO:Pd adsorption stoichiometry of 1:1. The Pd(F)
catalyst deactivated very fast in the first 20 min of TOS, and then
the activity decreased slowly (Fig. 3A). This deactivation can be
attributed to the coke deposition on the catalyst surface, blocking
the most active Pd sites [5]. This behavior has also been observed
for other active metals, like Pt, in n-butane dehydrogenation
reaction [14]. The initial activity and deactivation rate decreased
with the addition of Ga, where the catalyst with the highest Ga
content (0.72%, Ga/Pd = 1.68) reached the smallest activity and a
negligible deactivation rate. These effects of the Ga addition on the
catalytic behavior of Pd can be explained in terms of electronic
effects. Ga atoms can withdraw electronic density from Pd atoms
due to its higher electronegativity and, in consequence, modify the
catalytic properties of this active metal. The TPR and chemisorp-
tion results showed that Ga was in an intimate contact with Pd and
increased the Pd dispersion (at least until a content of 0.29% Ga) in
the fresh catalysts. However, a contribution of geometric effects of
Ga on the catalytic activity of Pd cannot completely be ruled out.
In general, the deactivation rate of the calcined catalysts was
higher than that corresponding to the fresh ones, and less
dependent on the Ga content (Fig.
3B) compared to the fresh
catalysts (Fig. 3A). Among the calcined catalysts, the catalyst with
the higher Ga content (Pd0.72Ga(C)) showed the lowest initial
activity and deactivation rate. These results can be associated to
the segregation of Pd and Ga, both as oxides, caused by the
calcination treatment. In comparison with the fresh catalysts, the
TPR results showed that a smaller amount of Ga, present as Ga2O3
in the calcined catalysts, was reduced after reduction and, in
consequence, less Ga species were
modifying the
catalytic
behavior of Pd.

catalysts. In general, the catalysts exhibited an increase in the
dehydrogenation selectivity with the TOS in parallel with a
diminution of the hydrogenolysis selectivity. This can be attributed
to a preferential blockage by coke of the Pd sites that are more
active for the hydrogenolysis reactions. Additionally, all the
catalysts showed an increase in the dehydrogenation selectivity
with increasing Ga content at the expenses of the hydrogenolysis
selectivity and, in fact, the catalyst with the highest Ga content
(Pd0.72Ga(F)) did not show hydrogenolysis products from the
beginning of the reaction. These results can also be explained in
terms of electronic effects of Ga on Pd. However, Jablonski et al. [3]
attributed an enhancement in the selectivity to propylene with the
Ga addition to Pt/Al2O3 catalysts in the propane dehydrogenation
reaction to the geometric and electronic modifications of the
metallic phase by Ga, leading to a low hydrogenolytic activity. On
the other hand, Machado et al. [15] observed the same effect of Ga
in a Pt/Ga-MCM-41 catalyst, and suggested that Ga segregated to
extra-framework positions might exercise a kind of geometric
effect on Pt clusters, inhibiting hydrogenolysis reactions.
The initial dehydrogenation selectivity was higher for the fresh
Pd(F) catalyst (48%) than for its calcined Pd(C) equivalent (32%).
This can be related to the fact that Pd dispersion was lower for the
fresh catalyst than for the calcined one, according with CO
chemisorption results (Table 2). Arteaga et al. [16] observed a clear
decrease in the dehydrogenation selectivity with increasing Pd
dispersion in Pd/Al2O3 catalysts, this being opposed to the trend
exhibited by supported Pt catalysts [17]. The fresh catalysts
containing
Ga
also
showed
higher
initial
dehydrogenation
selectivity (lower initial hydrogenolysis selectivity) than the
corresponding calcined catalysts. This superiority of the fresh
catalysts in catalyzing dehydrogenation reactions, can explain the
high activities of these catalysts in comparison with the calcined
ones. The calcination treatment could partially inhibit the effect of
the Ga addition on the activity and selectivity of Pd. This is in
agreement with the TPR and chemisorption results, which
evidenced that, after calcination, Pd and Ga oxides were partially
segregated since two peaks are attributable to Ga2O3 reduction.
This thermal treatment, which is generally used for the regenera-
tion of spent catalysts to remove the coke, can promote changes in
the surface composition of the bimetallic catalysts, and their
catalytic performance can be negatively affected after the final
activation stage. However, the catalyst with the higher Ga content
subjected to calcination (Pd0.72Ga(C)), compared to its fresh
counterpart, maintained its very high dehydrogenation selectivity
(100%), increased its catalytic activity, and showed a relative low
deactivation rate.
4. Conclusions
The simultaneous reduction of PdCl2 and Ga(NO3)3 species
occurred in the fresh bimetallic PdGa catalysts, where Pd0
assisted catalytically the reduction of Ga salt. The different
reduction peaks observed in the calcined bimetallic catalysts
indicate a segregation of Pd and Ga oxides during calcination. The
Ga2O3 species could be reduced in the calcined bimetallic catalysts
at temperatures lower than 700 8C due to the presence of Pd0
particles.
The addition of Ga increased the Pd dispersion of the fresh
(uncalcined) catalysts, except for the higher Ga content (0.72%, Ga/
Pd = 1.68). The calcination treatment caused an increase in the
dispersion of the catalysts, probably due to the formation of
PdOxCly species, which improve the dispersion. H2 chemisorption
and H2/O2 titrations are not reliable methods to determine the Pd
dispersion in the fresh catalysts. For the calcined catalysts with low
Ga contents (0.16%), the CO/Pd, H/Pd and O/Pd values were very
similar, but different for those with the higher Ga contents.
The monometallic Pd catalyst showed the highest activities and
deactivation rates caused by the deposition of coke. The addition of
Ga reduced the initial activity and deactivation. Calcination
partially suppressed the effect of Ga addition on the catalytic
behavior, since the calcined catalysts presented a lower depen-
dency of Ga content on activity than the fresh catalysts. The Ga
addition enhanced dehydrogenation selectivity, inhibiting hydro-
genolysis reactions on Pd. Coke had a similar effect. The catalyst
with the higher Ga content subjected to calcination presented an
enhanced catalytic performance.

First, you need to sequentially extract any quotes in the literature that are most relevant to each question, and print them in numbered order, separated by newlines. Quotes should be relatively brief. Do not attempt to summarize or answer questions at this stage, but simply repeat exactly what the corresponding part of the literature says.

Please enclose the full list of quotes in <quotes></quotes> XML tags. If there are no relevant quotes, write "No relevant quotes" instead.

Then, answer the question, starting with "Answer:".  Do not include or reference quoted content verbatim in the answer. Don't say "According to Quote [1]" when answering. Do not write reference number of quotes after answer. Put your answer to the user inside <EnglishVersionAnswer></EnglishVersionAnswer> XML tags. Output formatted text, with line breaks for each question.Separate quotes and answers with a blank line. Provide the answers to all questions in English. After completing the English answers, translate all those answers into Chinese and provide the Chinese version inside <ChineseVersionAnswer></ChineseVersionAnswer> XML tags.
