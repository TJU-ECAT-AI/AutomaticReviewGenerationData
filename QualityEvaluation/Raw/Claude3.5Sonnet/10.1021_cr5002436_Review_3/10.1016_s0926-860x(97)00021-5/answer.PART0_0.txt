[1] "In recent years, such supported vanadia catalysts have found wide commercial application as oxidation catalysts: selective oxidation of o-xylene to phthalic anhydride [6,7], ammoxidation of alkyl aromatics [8,9], selective catalytic reduction of NOx with NH3 [ 10] and controlling the oxidation of SO2 to SO3 during SCR [ 10-12]."

[2] "In addition to these oxidation reactions, supported vanadia catalysts have also been investigated for the oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes to olefins [ 13], oxidation of butane to maleic anhydride [ 14-17], pentane oxidation to maleic anhydride [18] and the selective oxidation of methanol to formaldehyde [19] or methyl formate [20]."

[3] "The TOFs for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propylene and butane to butene over V2Os/A1203 were found to increase with surface vanadia coverage, by as much as an order of magnitude, suggesting that other factors may also play a role for alumina supported vanadia catalysts [13,95,96]."

[4] "The characteristics of the bridging V-O-support bond can be altered by varying the specific oxide support or oxide support ligands without changing the structure of the surface vanadia species (with the exception of silica). The bridging V-O-support bond appears to be associated with the critical oxygen required for hydrocarbon oxidation reactions since changing the specific oxide support dramatically affects the TOF:"

The literature does not directly address the use of vanadium oxide catalysts as alternatives to Pt and CrOx for paraffin dehydrogenation or how research in this area has evolved since the 1980s. However, it does mention that supported vanadia catalysts have been investigated for oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes to olefins, which is related to paraffin dehydrogenation.

The document provides some insights into how variables such as carrier type, support surface area, and metal loading influence vanadium species in these catalysts:

1. Carrier type (support): The specific oxide support dramatically affects the turnover frequency (TOF) of hydrocarbon oxidation reactions. This is attributed to the influence of the bridging V-O-support bond, which appears to contain the critical oxygen required for these reactions.

2. Metal loading (surface vanadia coverage): For some reactions, such as the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propylene and butane to butene over V2O5/Al2O3, the TOF increases with surface vanadia coverage. This suggests that factors like surface acidity, lateral interactions, or the number of active sites may play a role in the catalytic behavior.

3. Support surface area: While not explicitly mentioned, the document discusses monolayer surface coverage of vanadia species on various supports. This implies that the support surface area would influence the total amount of active vanadia species that can be dispersed on the support.

The nature and behavior of vanadium species are also influenced by the presence of additives, the specific structure of the oxide support, and the reaction environment (e.g., reducing conditions, presence of moisture).

文献没有直接讨论钒氧化物催化剂作为Pt和CrOx替代品用于烷烃脱氢的情况，也没有提到这一领域自1980年代以来的研究演变。但是，文献确实提到了负载型钒氧化物催化剂被研究用于烷烃氧化脱氢制烯烃，这与烷烃脱氢有关。

文献提供了一些关于载体类型、载体表面积和金属负载量如何影响这些催化剂中钒物种的见解：

1. 载体类型：特定的氧化物载体对碳氢化合物氧化反应的转化频率(TOF)有显著影响。这被归因于桥接V-O-载体键的影响，该键似乎含有这些反应所需的关键氧。

2. 金属负载量（表面钒氧化物覆盖度）：对于某些反应，如V2O5/Al2O3上丙烷氧化脱氢制丙烯和丁烷氧化脱氢制丁烯，TOF随表面钒氧化物覆盖度的增加而增加。这表明表面酸性、横向相互作用或活性位点数量等因素可能在催化行为中起作用。

3. 载体表面积：虽然没有明确提及，但文献讨论了钒物种在各种载体上的单层表面覆盖。这意味着载体表面积会影响可以分散在载体上的活性钒物种的总量。

钒物种的性质和行为还受到添加剂存在、氧化物载体的特定结构以及反应环境（如还原条件、水分存在）的影响。
