[1] "Supported vanadium oxide catalysts, containing surface vanadia species on oxide supports, are extensively employed as catalysts for many hydrocarbon oxidation reactions."

[2] "In recent years, such supported vanadia catalysts have found wide commercial application as oxidation catalysts: selective oxidation of o-xylene to phthalic anhydride [6,7], ammoxidation of alkyl aromatics [8,9], selective catalytic reduction of NOx with NH3 [ 10] and controlling the oxidation of SO2 to SO3 during SCR [ 10-12]."

[3] "In addition to these oxidation reactions, supported vanadia catalysts have also been investigated for the oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes to olefins [ 13], oxidation of butane to maleic anhydride [ 14-17], pentane oxidation to maleic anhydride [18] and the selective oxidation of methanol to formaldehyde [19] or methyl formate [20]."

[4] "The oxidation of butane to maleic anhydride over V2Os/TiO2 was also found to slightly increase, by a factor of 2-3, with surface vanadia coverage because of the requirement of several surface vanadia sites for this hydrocarbon oxidation reaction"

[5] "The characteristics of the bridging V-O-support bond can be altered by varying the specific oxide support or oxide support ligands without changing the structure of the surface vanadia species (with the exception of silica). The bridging V-O-support bond appears to be associated with the critical oxygen required for hydrocarbon oxidation reactions since changing the specific oxide support dramatically affects the TOF: approximately four orders of magnitude for methanol oxidation to formaldehyde [19] and two-orders of magnitude for butane oxidation to maleic anhydride [36]."

The literature does not directly address the specific factors driving exploration of vanadium oxide catalysts as alternatives to Pt and CrOx for paraffin dehydrogenation. However, it does provide some relevant information on the development and properties of vanadium oxide catalysts:

Vanadium oxide catalysts supported on oxide supports have been extensively studied and commercially applied for various hydrocarbon oxidation reactions since the 1980s. These include selective oxidation of o-xylene, ammoxidation of alkyl aromatics, selective catalytic reduction of NOx, and oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes to olefins.

The nature and behavior of vanadium species in these catalysts are influenced by several variables:

1. Carrier type: The specific oxide support dramatically affects catalyst performance, with TOF varying by up to 4 orders of magnitude for some reactions when changing supports.

2. Surface area: While not explicitly discussed, the literature mentions surface coverage of vanadia species as an important factor, implying support surface area plays a role.

3. Metal loading: Increasing surface vanadia coverage can improve performance for some reactions, like butane oxidation to maleic anhydride, due to the requirement for multiple active sites.

4. Support-vanadia interaction: The bridging V-O-support bond is critical for catalytic activity, with its properties strongly influenced by the specific support used.

The research has evolved to focus on understanding the molecular structures of surface vanadia species and how they relate to catalytic performance across different supports and reaction conditions. This has led to insights on the roles of terminal V=O bonds, bridging V-O-V bonds, and bridging V-O-support bonds in various oxidation reactions.

文献并未直接讨论推动钒氧化物催化剂作为铂和铬氧化物替代品用于烷烃脱氢的具体因素。然而，它确实提供了一些关于钒氧化物催化剂发展和性质的相关信息：

自20世纪80年代以来，负载在氧化物载体上的钒氧化物催化剂已被广泛研究并商业应用于各种烃类氧化反应。这些反应包括邻二甲苯的选择性氧化、烷基芳烃的氨氧化、NOx的选择性催化还原以及烷烃到烯烃的氧化脱氢。

这些催化剂中钒物种的性质和行为受几个变量的影响：

1. 载体类型：特定的氧化物载体对催化剂性能有显著影响，对某些反应而言，改变载体可使转化频率(TOF)变化高达4个数量级。

2. 比表面积：虽然没有明确讨论，但文献提到钒物种的表面覆盖度是一个重要因素，暗示载体比表面积起着重要作用。

3. 金属负载量：增加表面钒物种覆盖度可以提高某些反应的性能，如丁烷氧化制马来酸酐，这是由于需要多个活性位点。

4. 载体-钒相互作用：桥接V-O-载体键对催化活性至关重要，其性质受所使用的特定载体强烈影响。

研究已经发展到关注表面钒物种的分子结构，以及它们如何在不同载体和反应条件下与催化性能相关。这导致了对端基V=O键、桥接V-O-V键和桥接V-O-载体键在各种氧化反应中作用的深入理解。
