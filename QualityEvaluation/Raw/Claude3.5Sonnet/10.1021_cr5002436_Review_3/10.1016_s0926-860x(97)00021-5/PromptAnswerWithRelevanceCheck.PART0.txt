[1] "In recent years, such supported vanadia catalysts have found wide commercial application as oxidation catalysts: selective oxidation of o-xylene to phthalic anhydride [6,7], ammoxidation of alkyl aromatics [8,9], selective catalytic reduction of NOx with NH3 [ 10] and controlling the oxidation of SO2 to SO3 during SCR [ 10-12]."

[2] "In addition to these oxidation reactions, supported vanadia catalysts have also been investigated for the oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes to olefins [ 13], oxidation of butane to maleic anhydride [ 14-17], pentane oxidation to maleic anhydride [18] and the selective oxidation of methanol to formaldehyde [19] or methyl formate [20]."

The literature does not directly address the use of vanadium oxide catalysts as alternatives to Pt and CrOx for paraffin dehydrogenation or how research in this area has evolved since the 1980s. However, it does mention that supported vanadia catalysts have been investigated for oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes to olefins, which is related to paraffin dehydrogenation.

The document provides some insights into how variables such as carrier type, support surface area, and metal loading influence vanadium species in these catalysts:

1. Carrier type (support): The specific oxide support dramatically affects the turnover frequency (TOF) of hydrocarbon oxidation reactions. This is attributed to the influence of the bridging V-O-support bond, which appears to contain the critical oxygen required for these reactions.

2. Metal loading (surface vanadia coverage): For some reactions, such as the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propylene and butane to butene over V2O5/Al2O3, the TOF increases with surface vanadia coverage. This suggests that factors like surface acidity, lateral interactions, or the number of active sites may play a role in the catalytic behavior.

3. Support surface area: While not explicitly mentioned, the document discusses monolayer surface coverage of vanadia species on various supports. This implies that the support surface area would influence the total amount of active vanadia species that can be dispersed on the support.

The nature and behavior of vanadium species are also influenced by the presence of additives, the specific structure of the oxide support, and the reaction environment (e.g., reducing conditions, presence of moisture).

文献没有直接讨论钒氧化物催化剂作为Pt和CrOx替代品用于烷烃脱氢的情况，也没有提到这一领域自1980年代以来的研究演变。但是，文献确实提到了负载型钒氧化物催化剂被研究用于烷烃氧化脱氢制烯烃，这与烷烃脱氢有关。

文献提供了一些关于载体类型、载体表面积和金属负载量如何影响这些催化剂中钒物种的见解：

1. 载体类型：特定的氧化物载体对碳氢化合物氧化反应的转化频率(TOF)有显著影响。这被归因于桥接V-O-载体键的影响，该键似乎含有这些反应所需的关键氧。

2. 金属负载量（表面钒氧化物覆盖度）：对于某些反应，如V2O5/Al2O3上丙烷氧化脱氢制丙烯和丁烷氧化脱氢制丁烯，TOF随表面钒氧化物覆盖度的增加而增加。这表明表面酸性、横向相互作用或活性位点数量等因素可能在催化行为中起作用。

3. 载体表面积：虽然没有明确提及，但文献讨论了钒物种在各种载体上的单层表面覆盖。这意味着载体表面积会影响可以分散在载体上的活性钒物种的总量。

钒物种的性质和行为还受到添加剂存在、氧化物载体的特定结构以及反应环境（如还原条件、水分存在）的影响。

[2] "The oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propylene over V2Os/Nb2Os was not dependent on the concentration of the bridging V-O-V bonds [94].

The TOFs for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propylene and butane to butene over V2Os/A1203 were found to increase with surface vanadia coverage, by as much as an order of magnitude, suggesting that other factors may also play a role for alumina supported vanadia catalysts [13,95,96]."

The general trend appears to be CeOz>ZrO2 TiO2>NbzOs>A12Os>SiO2, which inversely correlates with the Sanderson electronegativity of the oxide support cations [97]."

The exploration of vanadium oxide-based catalysts as alternatives to Pt and CrOx for paraffin dehydrogenation has been driven by several factors:

1. Versatility: Supported vanadia catalysts have found wide commercial application in various oxidation reactions, including the oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes to olefins.

2. Performance: Research since the 1980s has evolved to investigate the use of supported vanadia catalysts in multiple reactions, such as oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propylene and butane to butene.

3. Support influence: The type of carrier or support significantly influences the nature and behavior of vanadium species. The bridging V-O-support bond is critical for hydrocarbon oxidation reactions, with the reactivity trend following CeO2 > ZrO2 > TiO2 > Nb2O5 > Al2O3 > SiO2.

4. Surface area and metal loading: These variables affect the surface concentration of vanadia species and the ratio of isolated to polymerized species. The turnover frequency (TOF) for some reactions, like propane and butane dehydrogenation on V2O5/Al2O3, increases with surface vanadia coverage.

5. Structure-activity relationships: Research has focused on understanding how the molecular structure of surface vanadia species influences catalytic activity, with factors such as bridging V-O-V bonds, surface acidity, and lateral interactions playing roles in determining catalyst performance.

[3] "The surface vanadia monolayer is stable after its initial formation on many typical oxide supports (A1203, TiO2, ZrO2, Nb205 and CeO2). The driving force for the stability of the surface vanadia monolayer is the lower free energy of this structural arrangement than the exposed high surface area oxide supports [28]."

[4] "Monolayer surface coverage of the vanadia overlayer on different oxide supports was recently determined from Raman spectroscopy measurements and found to be approximately 7-8 VOx per nm2 [5,19]. The same monolayer surface VOx coverage was found for different oxide supports (A1203, TiO2, ZrO2, Nb205 and CeO2) with the exception of silica supported vanadia, which exhibited a maximum surface coverage of only 0.7 VOx per nm2."

1. Supported vanadia catalysts have been investigated for various oxidation reactions, including the oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes to olefins.

2. The specific structure of the oxide support does not significantly affect the reactivity of the surface vanadia species.

3. The surface vanadia monolayer is stable on many typical oxide supports (Al2O3, TiO2, ZrO2, Nb2O5, and CeO2) due to the lower free energy of this arrangement compared to exposed high surface area oxide supports.

4. Monolayer surface coverage of vanadia is similar (7-8 VOx per nm2) for different oxide supports, except for silica, which has a lower coverage (0.7 VOx per nm2).

These findings suggest that while the type of carrier can influence the surface coverage of vanadium species, the reactivity is not significantly affected by the specific structure of the oxide support. The stability of the vanadia monolayer on various supports indicates that metal loading up to monolayer coverage can be achieved without significant changes in the nature of the vanadium species.

文献没有直接讨论推动钒氧化物催化剂作为Pt和CrOx替代品用于烷烃脱氢的因素，也没有讨论自1980年代以来该领域研究的演变。然而，它确实提供了一些关于载体类型、支持物表面积和金属负载对这些催化剂中钒物种的影响的见解：

1. 负载型钒氧化物催化剂已被研究用于各种氧化反应，包括烷烃的氧化脱氢制烯烃。

2. 氧化物支持物的具体结构似乎不会显著影响表面钒物种的反应活性。

3. 表面钒单层在许多典型的氧化物支持物（Al2O3、TiO2、ZrO2、Nb2O5和CeO2）上是稳定的，这是由于这种结构排列的自由能比暴露的高比表面积氧化物支持物更低。

4. 在不同的氧化物支持物上，钒的单层表面覆盖度相似（每平方纳米7-8个VOx），但二氧化硅除外，后者的覆盖度较低（每平方纳米0.7个VOx）。

这些发现表明，虽然载体类型可以影响钒物种的表面覆盖度，但氧化物支持物的具体结构并不显著影响其反应活性。钒单层在各种支持物上的稳定性表明，可以在不显著改变钒物种性质的情况下，实现高达单层覆盖度的金属负载。

The literature does not directly address the specific factors driving exploration of vanadium oxide catalysts as alternatives to Pt and CrOx for paraffin dehydrogenation. However, it does provide some relevant information on the development and properties of vanadium oxide catalysts:

Vanadium oxide catalysts supported on oxide supports have been extensively studied and commercially applied for various hydrocarbon oxidation reactions since the 1980s. These include selective oxidation of o-xylene, ammoxidation of alkyl aromatics, selective catalytic reduction of NOx, and oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes to olefins.

The nature and behavior of vanadium species in these catalysts are influenced by several variables:

1. Carrier type: The specific oxide support dramatically affects catalyst performance, with TOF varying by up to 4 orders of magnitude for some reactions when changing supports.

2. Surface area: While not explicitly discussed, the literature mentions surface coverage of vanadia species as an important factor, implying support surface area plays a role.

3. Metal loading: Increasing surface vanadia coverage can improve performance for some reactions, like butane oxidation to maleic anhydride, due to the requirement for multiple active sites.

4. Support-vanadia interaction: The bridging V-O-support bond is critical for catalytic activity, with its properties strongly influenced by the specific support used.

The research has evolved to focus on understanding the molecular structures of surface vanadia species and how they relate to catalytic performance across different supports and reaction conditions. This has led to insights on the roles of terminal V=O bonds, bridging V-O-V bonds, and bridging V-O-support bonds in various oxidation reactions.

3. 金属负载量：增加表面钒物种覆盖度可以提高某些反应的性能，如丁烷氧化制马来酸酐，这是由于需要多个活性位点。

4. 载体-钒相互作用：桥接V-O-载体键对催化活性至关重要，其性质受所使用的特定载体强烈影响。

研究已经发展到关注表面钒物种的分子结构，以及它们如何在不同载体和反应条件下与催化性能相关。这导致了对端基V=O键、桥接V-O-V键和桥接V-O-载体键在各种氧化反应中作用的深入理解。
