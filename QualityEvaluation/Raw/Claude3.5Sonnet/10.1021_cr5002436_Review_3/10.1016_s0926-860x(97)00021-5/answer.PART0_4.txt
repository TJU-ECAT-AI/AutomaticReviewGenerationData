[1] "In recent years, such supported vanadia catalysts have found wide commercial application as oxidation catalysts: selective oxidation of o-xylene to phthalic anhydride [6,7], ammoxidation of alkyl aromatics [8,9], selective catalytic reduction of NOx with NH3 [ 10] and controlling the oxidation of SO2 to SO3 during SCR [ 10-12]. In addition to these oxidation reactions, supported vanadia catalysts have also been investigated for the oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes to olefins [ 13], oxidation of butane to maleic anhydride [ 14-17], pentane oxidation to maleic anhydride [18] and the selective oxidation of methanol to formaldehyde [19] or methyl formate [20]."

[2] "The reactivity properties of these catalysts will be compared with the corresponding structural information presented above (see Section 5) in order to develop molecular structure-reactivity/selectivity relationships for supported vanadia catalysts during hydrocarbon oxidation reactions."

[3] "Comparison of the surface vanadia molecular structural information with the corresponding reactivity/selectivity information has provided some insights into the reactivity properties of the surface vanadia species."

[4] "The bridging V-O-support bond, however, appears to be the most critical bond since its properties can change the TOF for hydrocarbon oxidation reactions by as much as four orders of magnitude."

[5] "The specific phase of the oxide support as well as the specific preparation method do not appear to influence the molecular structure or reactivity of the surface vanadia species."

The literature does not directly address the question about vanadium oxide-based catalysts as alternatives to Pt and CrOx for paraffin dehydrogenation or how research in this area has evolved since the 1980s. However, it does provide some relevant information about supported vanadium oxide catalysts and factors influencing their behavior:

1. Supported vanadia catalysts have found wide commercial application as oxidation catalysts for various reactions, including the oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes to olefins.

2. Research has focused on developing molecular structure-reactivity/selectivity relationships for supported vanadia catalysts during hydrocarbon oxidation reactions.

3. The bridging V-O-support bond appears to be the most critical factor influencing catalyst reactivity, with the ability to change the turnover frequency (TOF) for hydrocarbon oxidation reactions by up to four orders of magnitude.

4. The specific phase of the oxide support and the preparation method do not significantly influence the molecular structure or reactivity of the surface vanadia species.

5. The literature does not specifically address how carrier type, support surface area, and metal loading influence the nature and behavior of vanadium species in these catalysts.

该文献并未直接回答关于钒氧化物基催化剂作为Pt和CrOx替代品用于烷烃脱氢的问题，也未提及自1980年代以来该领域研究的演变。然而，它确实提供了一些关于负载型钒氧化物催化剂及影响其行为因素的相关信息：

1. 负载型钒氧化物催化剂在各种反应中被广泛应用于商业氧化催化剂，包括烷烃氧化脱氢制烯烃。

2. 研究重点在于发展负载型钒氧化物催化剂在烃类氧化反应中的分子结构-反应性/选择性关系。

3. 桥接V-O-载体键似乎是影响催化剂反应性的最关键因素，能够使烃类氧化反应的转化频率（TOF）变化高达四个数量级。

4. 载体的具体相态和制备方法对表面钒物种的分子结构或反应性没有显著影响。

5. 该文献并未具体讨论载体类型、载体表面积和金属负载量如何影响这些催化剂中钒物种的性质和行为。
