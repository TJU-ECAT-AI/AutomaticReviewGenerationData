[1] "In recent years, such supported vanadia catalysts have found wide commercial application as oxidation catalysts: selective oxidation of o-xylene to phthalic anhydride [6,7], ammoxidation of alkyl aromatics [8,9], selective catalytic reduction of NOx with NH3 [ 10] and controlling the oxidation of SO2 to SO3 during SCR [ 10-12]. In addition to these oxidation reactions, supported vanadia catalysts have also been investigated for the oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes to olefins [ 13], oxidation of butane to maleic anhydride [ 14-17], pentane oxidation to maleic anhydride [18] and the selective oxidation of methanol to formaldehyde [19] or methyl formate [20]."

[2] "The specific structure of the oxide support does not appear to affect the reactivity of the surface vanadia species."

[3] "The surface vanadia monolayer is stable after its initial formation on many typical oxide supports (A1203, TiO2, ZrO2, Nb205 and CeO2). The driving force for the stability of the surface vanadia monolayer is the lower free energy of this structural arrangement than the exposed high surface area oxide supports [28]."

[4] "Monolayer surface coverage of the vanadia overlayer on different oxide supports was recently determined from Raman spectroscopy measurements and found to be approximately 7-8 VOx per nm2 [5,19]. The same monolayer surface VOx coverage was found for different oxide supports (A1203, TiO2, ZrO2, Nb205 and CeO2) with the exception of silica supported vanadia, which exhibited a maximum surface coverage of only 0.7 VOx per nm2."

The literature does not directly address the factors driving exploration of vanadium oxide catalysts as alternatives to Pt and CrOx for paraffin dehydrogenation, or how research in this area has evolved since the 1980s. However, it does provide some insights into the influence of carrier type, support surface area, and metal loading on vanadium species in these catalysts:

1. Supported vanadia catalysts have been investigated for various oxidation reactions, including the oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes to olefins.

2. The specific structure of the oxide support does not significantly affect the reactivity of the surface vanadia species.

3. The surface vanadia monolayer is stable on many typical oxide supports (Al2O3, TiO2, ZrO2, Nb2O5, and CeO2) due to the lower free energy of this arrangement compared to exposed high surface area oxide supports.

4. Monolayer surface coverage of vanadia is similar (7-8 VOx per nm2) for different oxide supports, except for silica, which has a lower coverage (0.7 VOx per nm2).

These findings suggest that while the type of carrier can influence the surface coverage of vanadium species, the reactivity is not significantly affected by the specific structure of the oxide support. The stability of the vanadia monolayer on various supports indicates that metal loading up to monolayer coverage can be achieved without significant changes in the nature of the vanadium species.

文献没有直接讨论推动钒氧化物催化剂作为Pt和CrOx替代品用于烷烃脱氢的因素，也没有讨论自1980年代以来该领域研究的演变。然而，它确实提供了一些关于载体类型、支持物表面积和金属负载对这些催化剂中钒物种的影响的见解：

1. 负载型钒氧化物催化剂已被研究用于各种氧化反应，包括烷烃的氧化脱氢制烯烃。

2. 氧化物支持物的具体结构似乎不会显著影响表面钒物种的反应活性。

3. 表面钒单层在许多典型的氧化物支持物（Al2O3、TiO2、ZrO2、Nb2O5和CeO2）上是稳定的，这是由于这种结构排列的自由能比暴露的高比表面积氧化物支持物更低。

4. 在不同的氧化物支持物上，钒的单层表面覆盖度相似（每平方纳米7-8个VOx），但二氧化硅除外，后者的覆盖度较低（每平方纳米0.7个VOx）。

这些发现表明，虽然载体类型可以影响钒物种的表面覆盖度，但氧化物支持物的具体结构并不显著影响其反应活性。钒单层在各种支持物上的稳定性表明，可以在不显著改变钒物种性质的情况下，实现高达单层覆盖度的金属负载。
