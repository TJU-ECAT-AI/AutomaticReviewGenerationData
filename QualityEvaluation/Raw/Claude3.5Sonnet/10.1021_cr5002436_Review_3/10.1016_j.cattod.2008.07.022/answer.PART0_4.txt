[1] "The catalytic dehydrogenation and oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of light alkanes is an important route to the formation of alkenes and alkadienes, important precursors for fuels, plastics and many other materials. In particular, a substantial body of research has focused on supported VOx catalysts for ODH reactions [16]."

[2] "As vanadium loading increases, so does the domain size of the supported vanadate units with significant quantities of V2O5 observed at the highest loadings."

[3] "From these data it is possible to determine structureactivity relationships, with polymeric vanadia clusters favouring the formation of butenes and butadienes, while more isolated species are highly active towards the formation of polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbons retained on the catalyst surface post-reaction."

The exploration of vanadium oxide-based catalysts for paraffin dehydrogenation has been driven by their potential as alternatives to platinum and chromium oxide catalysts. Research in this area has evolved since the 1980s to focus on supported VOx catalysts for both dehydrogenation and oxidative dehydrogenation reactions.

Variables such as metal loading significantly influence the nature and behavior of vanadium species in these catalysts. As vanadium loading increases, the domain size of supported vanadate units increases, with higher loadings leading to the formation of V2O5. The type of vanadium species present affects catalytic performance, with polymeric vanadia clusters favoring the formation of desired butenes and butadienes, while more isolated species promote the formation of undesired polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbons.

While the literature does not explicitly discuss carrier type and support surface area, it can be inferred that these factors likely influence the dispersion and nature of vanadium species, which in turn affects catalytic behavior. The research has progressed to focus on understanding structure-activity relationships in these catalysts to optimize their performance for alkane dehydrogenation reactions.

钒氧化物基催化剂作为烷烃脱氢反应的替代品的研究主要是为了替代铂和铬氧化物催化剂。自20世纪80年代以来,该领域的研究已经发展到聚焦于负载型VOx催化剂在脱氢和氧化脱氢反应中的应用。

金属负载量等变量显著影响这些催化剂中钒物种的性质和行为。随着钒负载量的增加,负载的钒酸盐单元的尺寸增大,高负载量会导致V2O5的形成。存在的钒物种类型影响催化性能,其中聚合的钒族簇有利于形成所需的丁烯和丁二烯,而更孤立的物种则促进不需要的多环芳烃的形成。

虽然文献没有明确讨论载体类型和载体表面积,但可以推断这些因素可能会影响钒物种的分散和性质,从而影响催化行为。研究已经发展到关注这些催化剂的结构-活性关系,以优化它们在烷烃脱氢反应中的性能。
