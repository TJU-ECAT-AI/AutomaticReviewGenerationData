[1] "The catalytic dehydrogenation and oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of light alkanes is an important route to the formation of alkenes and alkadienes, important precursors for fuels, plastics and many other materials. In particular, a substantial body of research has focused on supported VOx catalysts for ODH reactions [16]."

[2] "Recently, studies have investigated the direct dehydrogenation of light alkanes over supported VOx catalysts in the absence of gas-phase oxygen where a different reaction mechanism must operate [711]."

[3] "As vanadium loading increases, so does the domain size of the supported vanadate units with significant quantities of V2O5 observed at the highest loadings."

[4] "As the vanadia loading increases, polyvanadate and crystalline V2O5 become the dominant vanadia species representing 60% and 10%, respectively of vanadium on the surface of 3.5 V. At higher loadings the fraction of V2O5 increases, reaching 30% on 8 V consistent with 51V MAS NMR results reported herein."

The exploration of vanadium oxide-based catalysts for paraffin dehydrogenation has been driven by the search for alternatives to platinum and chromium oxide catalysts. Research in this area has evolved since the 1980s from focusing on oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) reactions to investigating direct dehydrogenation in the absence of gas-phase oxygen.

Variables such as metal loading significantly influence the nature and behavior of vanadium species in these catalysts. As vanadium loading increases, the domain size of supported vanadate units grows, with higher loadings leading to the formation of more polyvanadate and crystalline V2O5 species. For example, at 3.5 wt% loading, polyvanadate and crystalline V2O5 represent 60% and 10% of surface vanadium species respectively, while at 8 wt% loading, the fraction of V2O5 increases to 30%.

The type of carrier and support surface area also play important roles in determining the nature of vanadium species, although specific details are not provided in the given text. However, it is clear that these factors, along with metal loading, significantly impact the structure and performance of vanadium oxide-based catalysts in paraffin dehydrogenation reactions.

钒氧化物基催化剂在烷烃脱氢领域的探索主要是为了寻找铂和铬氧化物催化剂的替代品。自20世纪80年代以来，该领域的研究从关注氧化脱氢(ODH)反应逐步演变为研究在无气相氧条件下的直接脱氢反应。

金属负载量等变量显著影响这些催化剂中钒物种的性质和行为。随着钒负载量的增加，负载的钒酸盐单元的域大小也随之增长，更高的负载量导致更多多聚钒酸盐和结晶V2O5物种的形成。例如，在3.5重量百分比的负载量下，多聚钒酸盐和结晶V2O5分别占表面钒物种的60%和10%，而在8重量百分比的负载量下，V2O5的比例增加到30%。

载体类型和支撑体表面积也在决定钒物种性质方面发挥重要作用，尽管给定文本中没有提供具体细节。然而，很明显这些因素与金属负载量一起，显著影响了钒氧化物基催化剂在烷烃脱氢反应中的结构和性能。

The exploration of vanadium oxide-based catalysts for paraffin dehydrogenation has been driven by the need for alternatives to Pt and CrOx catalysts. Research in this area has evolved since the 1980s from focusing on oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) reactions to investigating direct dehydrogenation of light alkanes in the absence of gas-phase oxygen.

Variables such as metal loading significantly influence the nature and behavior of vanadium species in these catalysts. As vanadium loading increases, the domain size of supported vanadate units increases, with higher loadings resulting in more V2O5 formation. 

The type of vanadium species present affects catalyst performance. Polymeric vanadia clusters favor the formation of desired products (butenes and butadienes), while more isolated species promote the formation of undesired polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbons that remain on the catalyst surface after reaction.

While the literature does not directly address the influence of carrier type and support surface area, it does mention that the catalysts are supported on alumina, suggesting that support properties play a role in catalyst behavior.

钒氧化物基催化剂作为烷烃脱氢替代铂和氧化铬催化剂的探索，是由寻找替代品的需求所驱动的。自1980年代以来，该领域的研究已经从关注氧化脱氢(ODH)反应演变为研究在无气相氧条件下的直接脱氢轻烷烃。

金属负载量等变量显著影响这些催化剂中钒物种的性质和行为。随着钒负载量的增加，支持的钒酸盐单元的域大小增加，较高的负载量会导致更多V2O5的形成。

存在的钒物种类型影响催化剂性能。聚合的钒氧化物簇有利于形成所需产物（丁烯和丁二烯），而更孤立的物种促进形成不需要的多环芳烃，这些芳烃在反应后留在催化剂表面。

虽然文献没有直接讨论载体类型和支持表面积的影响，但确实提到催化剂是由氧化铝支持的，这表明支持体性质在催化剂行为中起作用。

The exploration of vanadium oxide-based catalysts for paraffin dehydrogenation has been driven by the need for alternative catalysts to Pt and CrOx for producing alkenes and alkadienes, which are important precursors for fuels, plastics, and other materials. Research in this area has evolved since the 1980s to focus on both oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) and direct dehydrogenation of light alkanes using supported VOx catalysts.

Variables such as metal loading significantly influence the nature and behavior of vanadium species in these catalysts. As vanadium loading increases, the domain size of supported vanadate units increases, with higher loadings resulting in significant quantities of V2O5. The support surface area is also affected by metal loading, decreasing as vanadium content increases.

The type of carrier or support material plays a crucial role in determining the dispersion and structure of vanadium species, which in turn affects catalytic performance. While not explicitly stated in the given text, research in this field typically investigates various support materials such as alumina, silica, and titania to optimize catalyst properties.

Overall, research has evolved to focus on understanding the relationship between catalyst structure, composition, and performance in both oxidative and non-oxidative dehydrogenation reactions, with the goal of developing more efficient and selective catalysts for paraffin dehydrogenation.

钒氧化物基催化剂在烷烃脱氢领域的探索主要是由于需要寻找替代铂和铬氧化物的催化剂，以生产烯烃和二烯烃，这些是燃料、塑料和其他材料的重要前体。自20世纪80年代以来，该领域的研究已经发展到既关注轻烷烃的氧化脱氢(ODH)，也关注使用负载型VOx催化剂的直接脱氢。

金属负载量等变量显著影响这些催化剂中钒物种的性质和行为。随着钒负载量的增加，负载钒酸盐单元的域尺寸增大，较高的负载量会导致显著数量的V2O5形成。载体表面积也受金属负载量影响，随着钒含量的增加而减少。

载体或支撑材料的类型在决定钒物种的分散和结构方面起着至关重要的作用，这反过来又影响催化性能。虽然在给定的文本中没有明确说明，但该领域的研究通常会研究各种支撑材料，如氧化铝、二氧化硅和二氧化钛，以优化催化剂性能。

总的来说，研究已经发展到关注催化剂结构、组成和性能之间在氧化和非氧化脱氢反应中的关系，目标是开发更高效、更有选择性的烷烃脱氢催化剂。

[3] "Employing both UV and visible Raman spectroscopy these previous studies provided a quantitative determination of the different surface species (monomeric vanadates, polymeric vanadates and crystalline vanadia) present [20]. It was shown that monomeric vanadate species are predominant on the surface of catalysts with vanadium loadings ≤1 wt.%. As the vanadia loading increases, polyvanadate and crystalline V2O5 become the dominant vanadia species representing 60% and 10%, respectively of vanadium on the surface of 3.5 V."

The exploration of vanadium oxide-based catalysts for paraffin dehydrogenation has been driven by the need for alternatives to Pt and CrOx catalysts. Research in this area has evolved significantly since the 1980s, focusing on supported VOx catalysts for both dehydrogenation and oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) reactions.

Several variables influence the nature and behavior of vanadium species in these catalysts:

1. Metal loading: As vanadium loading increases, the domain size of supported vanadate units grows. At low loadings (≤1 wt.%), monomeric vanadate species predominate. Higher loadings lead to the formation of polyvanadate and crystalline V2O5 species.

2. Support surface area: The support's surface area affects the dispersion and distribution of vanadium species. Higher surface area supports generally allow for better dispersion of vanadium oxide species.

3. Carrier type: While not explicitly mentioned in the given text, the type of carrier (support material) can significantly influence the behavior of vanadium species. In this study, alumina (Al2O3) was used as the support.

4. Calcination temperature: This strongly influences catalyst structure and, consequently, catalytic performance. Higher calcination temperatures can lead to the dispersion of crystalline vanadia species and the formation of more polymeric species.

These factors collectively determine the distribution of vanadium species (monomeric, polymeric, or crystalline) on the catalyst surface, which in turn affects the catalyst's activity, selectivity, and stability in paraffin dehydrogenation reactions.

几个变量影响这些催化剂中钒物种的性质和行为：

1. 金属负载量：随着钒负载量的增加，支持的钒酸盐单元的域大小也会增加。在低负载量（≤1 wt.%）时，单体钒酸盐物种占主导地位。更高的负载量会导致多聚钒酸盐和结晶V2O5物种的形成。

2. 载体表面积：载体的表面积影响钒物种的分散和分布。通常，高表面积的载体能够更好地分散钒氧化物物种。

3. 载体类型：虽然在给定的文本中没有明确提到，但载体（支持材料）的类型可以显著影响钒物种的行为。在这项研究中，使用了氧化铝（Al2O3）作为载体。

4. 焙烧温度：这强烈影响催化剂结构，进而影响催化性能。较高的焙烧温度可以导致晶态钒氧化物物种的分散和更多聚合物种的形成。

这些因素共同决定了催化剂表面钒物种（单体、聚合物或晶态）的分布，进而影响催化剂在烷烃脱氢反应中的活性、选择性和稳定性。
