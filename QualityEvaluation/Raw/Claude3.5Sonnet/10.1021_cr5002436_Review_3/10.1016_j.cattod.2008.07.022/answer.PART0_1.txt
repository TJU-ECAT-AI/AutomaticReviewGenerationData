[1] "The catalytic dehydrogenation and oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of light alkanes is an important route to the formation of alkenes and alkadienes, important precursors for fuels, plastics and many other materials. In particular, a substantial body of research has focused on supported VOx catalysts for ODH reactions [16]."

[2] "Recently, studies have investigated the direct dehydrogenation of light alkanes over supported VOx catalysts in the absence of gas-phase oxygen where a different reaction mechanism must operate [711]."

[3] "As vanadium loading increases, so does the domain size of the supported vanadate units with significant quantities of V2O5 observed at the highest loadings."

[4] "From these data it is possible to determine structureactivity relationships, with polymeric vanadia clusters favouring the formation of butenes and butadienes, while more isolated species are highly active towards the formation of polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbons retained on the catalyst surface post-reaction."

The exploration of vanadium oxide-based catalysts for paraffin dehydrogenation has been driven by the need for alternatives to Pt and CrOx catalysts. Research in this area has evolved since the 1980s from focusing on oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) reactions to investigating direct dehydrogenation of light alkanes in the absence of gas-phase oxygen.

Variables such as metal loading significantly influence the nature and behavior of vanadium species in these catalysts. As vanadium loading increases, the domain size of supported vanadate units increases, with higher loadings resulting in more V2O5 formation. 

The type of vanadium species present affects catalyst performance. Polymeric vanadia clusters favor the formation of desired products (butenes and butadienes), while more isolated species promote the formation of undesired polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbons that remain on the catalyst surface after reaction.

While the literature does not directly address the influence of carrier type and support surface area, it does mention that the catalysts are supported on alumina, suggesting that support properties play a role in catalyst behavior.

钒氧化物基催化剂作为烷烃脱氢替代铂和氧化铬催化剂的探索，是由寻找替代品的需求所驱动的。自1980年代以来，该领域的研究已经从关注氧化脱氢(ODH)反应演变为研究在无气相氧条件下的直接脱氢轻烷烃。

金属负载量等变量显著影响这些催化剂中钒物种的性质和行为。随着钒负载量的增加，支持的钒酸盐单元的域大小增加，较高的负载量会导致更多V2O5的形成。

存在的钒物种类型影响催化剂性能。聚合的钒氧化物簇有利于形成所需产物（丁烯和丁二烯），而更孤立的物种促进形成不需要的多环芳烃，这些芳烃在反应后留在催化剂表面。

虽然文献没有直接讨论载体类型和支持表面积的影响，但确实提到催化剂是由氧化铝支持的，这表明支持体性质在催化剂行为中起作用。
