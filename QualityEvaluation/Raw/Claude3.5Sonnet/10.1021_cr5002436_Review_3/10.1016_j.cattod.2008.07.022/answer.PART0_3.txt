[1] "The catalytic dehydrogenation and oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of light alkanes is an important route to the formation of alkenes and alkadienes, important precursors for fuels, plastics and many other materials. In particular, a substantial body of research has focused on supported VOx catalysts for ODH reactions [1–6]."

[2] "As vanadium loading increases, so does the domain size of the supported vanadate units with significant quantities of V2O5 observed at the highest loadings."

[3] "Employing both UV and visible Raman spectroscopy these previous studies provided a quantitative determination of the different surface species (monomeric vanadates, polymeric vanadates and crystalline vanadia) present [20]. It was shown that monomeric vanadate species are predominant on the surface of catalysts with vanadium loadings ≤1 wt.%. As the vanadia loading increases, polyvanadate and crystalline V2O5 become the dominant vanadia species representing 60% and 10%, respectively of vanadium on the surface of 3.5 V."

[4] "Calcination temperature is known to strongly influence catalyst structure and therefore catalytic performance [21,22]."

The exploration of vanadium oxide-based catalysts for paraffin dehydrogenation has been driven by the need for alternatives to Pt and CrOx catalysts. Research in this area has evolved significantly since the 1980s, focusing on supported VOx catalysts for both dehydrogenation and oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) reactions.

Several variables influence the nature and behavior of vanadium species in these catalysts:

1. Metal loading: As vanadium loading increases, the domain size of supported vanadate units grows. At low loadings (≤1 wt.%), monomeric vanadate species predominate. Higher loadings lead to the formation of polyvanadate and crystalline V2O5 species.

2. Support surface area: The support's surface area affects the dispersion and distribution of vanadium species. Higher surface area supports generally allow for better dispersion of vanadium oxide species.

3. Carrier type: While not explicitly mentioned in the given text, the type of carrier (support material) can significantly influence the behavior of vanadium species. In this study, alumina (Al2O3) was used as the support.

4. Calcination temperature: This strongly influences catalyst structure and, consequently, catalytic performance. Higher calcination temperatures can lead to the dispersion of crystalline vanadia species and the formation of more polymeric species.

These factors collectively determine the distribution of vanadium species (monomeric, polymeric, or crystalline) on the catalyst surface, which in turn affects the catalyst's activity, selectivity, and stability in paraffin dehydrogenation reactions.

钒氧化物基催化剂作为烷烃脱氢反应的替代品的研究，主要是为了寻找铂和氧化铬催化剂的替代品。自20世纪80年代以来，这一领域的研究显著发展，重点关注于支持型VOx催化剂在脱氢和氧化脱氢（ODH）反应中的应用。

几个变量影响这些催化剂中钒物种的性质和行为：

1. 金属负载量：随着钒负载量的增加，支持的钒酸盐单元的域大小也会增加。在低负载量（≤1 wt.%）时，单体钒酸盐物种占主导地位。更高的负载量会导致多聚钒酸盐和结晶V2O5物种的形成。

2. 载体表面积：载体的表面积影响钒物种的分散和分布。通常，高表面积的载体能够更好地分散钒氧化物物种。

3. 载体类型：虽然在给定的文本中没有明确提到，但载体（支持材料）的类型可以显著影响钒物种的行为。在这项研究中，使用了氧化铝（Al2O3）作为载体。

4. 焙烧温度：这强烈影响催化剂结构，进而影响催化性能。较高的焙烧温度可以导致晶态钒氧化物物种的分散和更多聚合物种的形成。

这些因素共同决定了催化剂表面钒物种（单体、聚合物或晶态）的分布，进而影响催化剂在烷烃脱氢反应中的活性、选择性和稳定性。
