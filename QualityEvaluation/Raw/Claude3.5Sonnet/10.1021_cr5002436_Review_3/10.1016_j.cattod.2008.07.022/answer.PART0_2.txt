[1] "The catalytic dehydrogenation and oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of light alkanes is an important route to the formation of alkenes and alkadienes, important precursors for fuels, plastics and many other materials. In particular, a substantial body of research has focused on supported VOx catalysts for ODH reactions [16]."

[2] "Recently, studies have investigated the direct dehydrogenation of light alkanes over supported VOx catalysts in the absence of gas-phase oxygen where a different reaction mechanism must operate [711]."

[3] "As vanadium loading increases, so does the domain size of the supported vanadate units with significant quantities of V2O5 observed at the highest loadings."

[4] "As expected, the measured surface area decreases with increasing vanadium loading, from 104 m2 g1 for 1 V to 77 m2 g1 for 8 V."

The exploration of vanadium oxide-based catalysts for paraffin dehydrogenation has been driven by the need for alternative catalysts to Pt and CrOx for producing alkenes and alkadienes, which are important precursors for fuels, plastics, and other materials. Research in this area has evolved since the 1980s to focus on both oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) and direct dehydrogenation of light alkanes using supported VOx catalysts.

Variables such as metal loading significantly influence the nature and behavior of vanadium species in these catalysts. As vanadium loading increases, the domain size of supported vanadate units increases, with higher loadings resulting in significant quantities of V2O5. The support surface area is also affected by metal loading, decreasing as vanadium content increases.

The type of carrier or support material plays a crucial role in determining the dispersion and structure of vanadium species, which in turn affects catalytic performance. While not explicitly stated in the given text, research in this field typically investigates various support materials such as alumina, silica, and titania to optimize catalyst properties.

Overall, research has evolved to focus on understanding the relationship between catalyst structure, composition, and performance in both oxidative and non-oxidative dehydrogenation reactions, with the goal of developing more efficient and selective catalysts for paraffin dehydrogenation.

钒氧化物基催化剂在烷烃脱氢领域的探索主要是由于需要寻找替代铂和铬氧化物的催化剂，以生产烯烃和二烯烃，这些是燃料、塑料和其他材料的重要前体。自20世纪80年代以来，该领域的研究已经发展到既关注轻烷烃的氧化脱氢(ODH)，也关注使用负载型VOx催化剂的直接脱氢。

金属负载量等变量显著影响这些催化剂中钒物种的性质和行为。随着钒负载量的增加，负载钒酸盐单元的域尺寸增大，较高的负载量会导致显著数量的V2O5形成。载体表面积也受金属负载量影响，随着钒含量的增加而减少。

载体或支撑材料的类型在决定钒物种的分散和结构方面起着至关重要的作用，这反过来又影响催化性能。虽然在给定的文本中没有明确说明，但该领域的研究通常会研究各种支撑材料，如氧化铝、二氧化硅和二氧化钛，以优化催化剂性能。

总的来说，研究已经发展到关注催化剂结构、组成和性能之间在氧化和非氧化脱氢反应中的关系，目标是开发更高效、更有选择性的烷烃脱氢催化剂。
