[1] "The catalytic dehydrogenation and oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of light alkanes is an important route to the formation of alkenes and alkadienes, important precursors for fuels, plastics and many other materials. In particular, a substantial body of research has focused on supported VOx catalysts for ODH reactions [16]."

[2] "Recently, studies have investigated the direct dehydrogenation of light alkanes over supported VOx catalysts in the absence of gas-phase oxygen where a different reaction mechanism must operate [711]."

[3] "As vanadium loading increases, so does the domain size of the supported vanadate units with significant quantities of V2O5 observed at the highest loadings."

[4] "As the vanadia loading increases, polyvanadate and crystalline V2O5 become the dominant vanadia species representing 60% and 10%, respectively of vanadium on the surface of 3.5 V. At higher loadings the fraction of V2O5 increases, reaching 30% on 8 V consistent with 51V MAS NMR results reported herein."

The exploration of vanadium oxide-based catalysts for paraffin dehydrogenation has been driven by the search for alternatives to platinum and chromium oxide catalysts. Research in this area has evolved since the 1980s from focusing on oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) reactions to investigating direct dehydrogenation in the absence of gas-phase oxygen.

Variables such as metal loading significantly influence the nature and behavior of vanadium species in these catalysts. As vanadium loading increases, the domain size of supported vanadate units grows, with higher loadings leading to the formation of more polyvanadate and crystalline V2O5 species. For example, at 3.5 wt% loading, polyvanadate and crystalline V2O5 represent 60% and 10% of surface vanadium species respectively, while at 8 wt% loading, the fraction of V2O5 increases to 30%.

The type of carrier and support surface area also play important roles in determining the nature of vanadium species, although specific details are not provided in the given text. However, it is clear that these factors, along with metal loading, significantly impact the structure and performance of vanadium oxide-based catalysts in paraffin dehydrogenation reactions.

钒氧化物基催化剂在烷烃脱氢领域的探索主要是为了寻找铂和铬氧化物催化剂的替代品。自20世纪80年代以来，该领域的研究从关注氧化脱氢(ODH)反应逐步演变为研究在无气相氧条件下的直接脱氢反应。

金属负载量等变量显著影响这些催化剂中钒物种的性质和行为。随着钒负载量的增加，负载的钒酸盐单元的域大小也随之增长，更高的负载量导致更多多聚钒酸盐和结晶V2O5物种的形成。例如，在3.5重量百分比的负载量下，多聚钒酸盐和结晶V2O5分别占表面钒物种的60%和10%，而在8重量百分比的负载量下，V2O5的比例增加到30%。

载体类型和支撑体表面积也在决定钒物种性质方面发挥重要作用，尽管给定文本中没有提供具体细节。然而，很明显这些因素与金属负载量一起，显著影响了钒氧化物基催化剂在烷烃脱氢反应中的结构和性能。
