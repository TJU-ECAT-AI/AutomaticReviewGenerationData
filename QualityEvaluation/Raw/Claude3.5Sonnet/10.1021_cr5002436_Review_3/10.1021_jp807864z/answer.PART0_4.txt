The given literature does not contain any information relevant to answering the question about vanadium oxide-based catalysts for paraffin dehydrogenation. The document appears to be about a study of propane dehydrogenation over a Ga2O3 surface, and does not mention vanadium oxide catalysts, their development since the 1980s, or factors influencing their behavior. Without additional relevant information, this question cannot be accurately answered based on the provided text.

给定的文献中不包含任何与回答关于钒氧化物基催化剂用于烷烃脱氢的问题相关的信息。该文档似乎是关于Ga2O3表面上丙烷脱氢的研究，并未提及钒氧化物催化剂、它们自1980年代以来的发展，或影响它们行为的因素。没有额外的相关信息，无法根据提供的文本准确回答这个问题。
