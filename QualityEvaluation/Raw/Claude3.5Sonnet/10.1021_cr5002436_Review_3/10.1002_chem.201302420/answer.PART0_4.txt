[1] "Literature on catalytic propane dehydrogenation is dominated by supported Cr oxides11 and Pt-based systems.12 However, these catalysts are either rare and costly, or hazardous."

[2] "We recently studied the formation mechanism of hcp β-Mo2C by carburization of hexagonal molybdenum oxide as well as the impact of its V doping (3 to 11%)."

[3] "The addition of V strongly influences the carburization temperature of the hexagonal h-Mo1xVxO3 precursors suggesting a stabilizing effect on the redox properties of the materials."

[4] "Two strategies of stabilization of the selective sites for propylene formation have been proposed in the present work: i) the addition of mildly oxidizing H2O or CO2 to the feed (the latter is rapidly converted to H2O via rWGS), and ii) the addition of V as an oxophilic dopant for the Mo2C catalyst."

The literature does not provide a comprehensive historical overview of vanadium oxide-based catalysts for paraffin dehydrogenation since the 1980s. However, it does indicate some factors driving exploration of alternatives to Pt and CrOx catalysts:

1. Platinum-based and chromium oxide catalysts dominate propane dehydrogenation, but have drawbacks of being rare, costly, or hazardous.

2. Molybdenum carbide catalysts have been explored as alternatives, with vanadium doping investigated to improve their properties.

3. Vanadium doping influences the carburization of molybdenum oxide precursors and stabilizes the redox properties of the resulting catalysts.

4. Adding vanadium as an oxophilic dopant is proposed as a strategy to stabilize selective sites for propylene formation in Mo2C catalysts.

The document does not provide specific information on how carrier type, support surface area, and metal loading influence vanadium species in these catalysts. The focus is mainly on vanadium as a dopant for molybdenum carbide catalysts rather than standalone vanadium oxide catalysts.

该文献并未提供自1980年代以来钒氧化物基催化剂用于烷烃脱氢的全面历史概述。但是，它确实指出了一些驱动探索铂和铬氧化物催化剂替代品的因素：

1. 铂基和铬氧化物催化剂在丙烷脱氢中占主导地位，但具有稀有、昂贵或有害的缺点。

2. 研究人员探索了碳化钼催化剂作为替代品，并研究了钒掺杂以改善其性能。

3. 钒掺杂影响钼氧化物前体的碳化过程，并稳定了所得催化剂的氧化还原性质。

4. 添加钒作为亲氧性掺杂剂被提议作为一种策略，以稳定Mo2C催化剂中丙烯生成的选择性位点。

该文件未提供关于载体类型、支撑表面积和金属负载如何影响这些催化剂中钒物种的具体信息。文章主要关注钒作为碳化钼催化剂的掺杂剂，而不是独立的钒氧化物催化剂。
