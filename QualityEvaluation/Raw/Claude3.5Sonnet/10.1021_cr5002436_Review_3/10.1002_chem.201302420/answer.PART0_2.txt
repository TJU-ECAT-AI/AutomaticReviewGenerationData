[1] "Literature on catalytic propane dehydrogenation is dominated by supported Cr oxides11 and Pt-based systems.12 However, these catalysts are either rare and costly, or hazardous."

[2] "We recently studied the formation mechanism of hcp β-Mo2C by carburization of hexagonal molybdenum oxide as well as the impact of its V doping (3 to 11%)."

[3] "Two strategies of stabilization of the selective sites for propylene formation have been proposed in the present work: i) the addition of mildly oxidizing H2O or CO2 to the feed (the latter is rapidly converted to H2O via rWGS), and ii) the addition of V as an oxophilic dopant for the Mo2C catalyst."

The literature does not provide a comprehensive overview of the evolution of vanadium oxide-based catalysts for paraffin dehydrogenation since the 1980s. However, it does mention some factors that have driven exploration of alternatives to platinum and chromium oxide catalysts:

1. Cost and rarity of platinum-based catalysts
2. Hazardous nature of chromium oxide catalysts

The document focuses more on molybdenum carbide catalysts, mentioning vanadium primarily as a dopant. It suggests that adding vanadium as an oxophilic dopant to Mo2C catalysts can help stabilize selective sites for propylene formation. 

The literature does not discuss how variables such as carrier type, support surface area, and metal loading influence the nature and behavior of vanadium species in these catalysts. Instead, it focuses on the effects of vanadium doping on molybdenum carbide catalysts, noting that V doping leads to a larger contribution of associated carbon and oxygen species at the surface, and that the immediate surface layer is highly enriched in V.

Overall, while the document touches on some aspects of vanadium in catalysts for paraffin dehydrogenation, it does not provide a comprehensive answer to the question as posed.

该文献并未提供自1980年代以来钒氧化物基催化剂在烷烃脱氢方面演变的全面概述。然而，它确实提到了一些推动寻找铂和铬氧化物催化剂替代品的因素：

1. 铂基催化剂的成本高昂和稀缺性
2. 铬氧化物催化剂的有害性质

该文档更多地关注钼碳化物催化剂，主要将钒作为掺杂剂提及。它建议将钒作为亲氧性掺杂剂添加到Mo2C催化剂中可以帮助稳定丙烯形成的选择性位点。

文献并未讨论载体类型、载体表面积和金属负载量等变量如何影响这些催化剂中钒物种的性质和行为。相反，它侧重于钒掺杂对钼碳化物催化剂的影响，指出V掺杂导致表面相关碳和氧物种的贡献增加，并且最表层高度富集V。

总的来说，虽然该文档涉及了钒在烷烃脱氢催化剂中的一些方面，但并未对所提出的问题提供全面的回答。
