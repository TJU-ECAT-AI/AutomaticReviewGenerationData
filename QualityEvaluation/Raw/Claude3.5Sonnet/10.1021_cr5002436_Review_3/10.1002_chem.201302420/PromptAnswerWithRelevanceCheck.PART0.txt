[1] "Since the early transition metal carbides were found to provide noble metal-like properties,1,2 there has been a renewed interest in these materials in the field of catalysis, especially so in the case of Group 5 and 6 carbides."

[2] "We recently studied the formation mechanism of hcp β-Mo2C by carburization of hexagonal molybdenum oxide as well as the impact of its V doping (3 to 11%)."

[3] "Two strategies of stabilization of the selective sites for propylene formation have been proposed in the present work: i) the addition of mildly oxidizing H2O or CO2 to the feed (the latter is rapidly converted to H2O via rWGS), and ii) the addition of V as an oxophilic dopant for the Mo2C catalyst."

The literature does not provide a comprehensive answer to the specific question about the evolution of research on vanadium oxide-based catalysts for paraffin dehydrogenation since the 1980s. However, it does mention some relevant information about transition metal carbides, including vanadium-doped molybdenum carbide catalysts:

1. There has been renewed interest in early transition metal carbides, especially Group 5 and 6 carbides, as catalysts with noble metal-like properties.

2. The researchers studied vanadium-doped molybdenum carbide (V-doped Mo2C) catalysts, with V doping levels of 3-11%.

3. Adding vanadium as an oxophilic dopant to Mo2C catalysts was proposed as a strategy to stabilize selective sites for propylene formation in propane dehydrogenation.

The document does not provide specific information about the evolution of research since the 1980s or the influence of variables such as carrier type, support surface area, and metal loading on vanadium species in these catalysts.

[1] "Literature on catalytic propane dehydrogenation is dominated by supported Cr oxides11 and Pt-based systems.12 However, these catalysts are either rare and costly, or hazardous."

[3] "The addition of V strongly influences the carburization temperature of the hexagonal h-Mo1xVxO3 precursors suggesting a stabilizing effect on the redox properties of the materials."

The literature does not provide a comprehensive overview of the evolution of vanadium oxide-based catalysts for paraffin dehydrogenation since the 1980s. However, it does mention some factors driving exploration of alternatives to platinum and chromium oxide catalysts, namely that these traditional catalysts are either rare and costly, or hazardous.

The document discusses molybdenum carbide catalysts doped with vanadium as potential alternatives. It notes that vanadium doping influences the carburization temperature of molybdenum oxide precursors, suggesting it has a stabilizing effect on redox properties. The authors propose that moderate oxygen doping, facilitated by vanadium's higher oxophilicity compared to molybdenum, could be a key factor for reactivity in this catalytic system.

However, the literature does not provide detailed information on how variables like carrier type, support surface area, and metal loading influence vanadium species in these catalysts. The focus is primarily on molybdenum carbide catalysts with vanadium doping, rather than vanadium oxide catalysts specifically.

Given the limited information provided in the document, a comprehensive answer to the question as posed is not possible. More research focused specifically on the development of vanadium oxide catalysts for paraffin dehydrogenation would be needed to fully address the question.

这篇文献并没有提供自1980年代以来钒氧化物基催化剂在烷烃脱氢方面发展的全面概述。然而,它确实提到了一些推动探索替代铂和铬氧化物催化剂的因素,即这些传统催化剂要么稀有且昂贵,要么有害。

文档讨论了掺杂钒的碳化钼催化剂作为潜在的替代品。它指出,钒掺杂影响氧化钼前体的碳化温度,这表明它对氧化还原性质有稳定作用。作者提出,由钒比钼更高的亲氧性所促进的适度氧掺杂,可能是这种催化系统反应性的关键因素。

然而,文献并未提供关于载体类型、支撑体表面积和金属负载量等变量如何影响这些催化剂中钒物种的详细信息。重点主要是掺钒的碳化钼催化剂,而不是专门的钒氧化物催化剂。

鉴于文档中提供的信息有限,无法对所提出的问题给出全面的回答。需要更多专门针对钒氧化物催化剂在烷烃脱氢方面发展的研究,才能全面回答这个问题。

The literature does not provide a comprehensive overview of the evolution of vanadium oxide-based catalysts for paraffin dehydrogenation since the 1980s. However, it does mention some factors that have driven exploration of alternatives to platinum and chromium oxide catalysts:

1. Cost and rarity of platinum-based catalysts
2. Hazardous nature of chromium oxide catalysts

The document focuses more on molybdenum carbide catalysts, mentioning vanadium primarily as a dopant. It suggests that adding vanadium as an oxophilic dopant to Mo2C catalysts can help stabilize selective sites for propylene formation. 

The literature does not discuss how variables such as carrier type, support surface area, and metal loading influence the nature and behavior of vanadium species in these catalysts. Instead, it focuses on the effects of vanadium doping on molybdenum carbide catalysts, noting that V doping leads to a larger contribution of associated carbon and oxygen species at the surface, and that the immediate surface layer is highly enriched in V.

Overall, while the document touches on some aspects of vanadium in catalysts for paraffin dehydrogenation, it does not provide a comprehensive answer to the question as posed.

该文献并未提供自1980年代以来钒氧化物基催化剂在烷烃脱氢方面演变的全面概述。然而，它确实提到了一些推动寻找铂和铬氧化物催化剂替代品的因素：

1. 铂基催化剂的成本高昂和稀缺性
2. 铬氧化物催化剂的有害性质

该文档更多地关注钼碳化物催化剂，主要将钒作为掺杂剂提及。它建议将钒作为亲氧性掺杂剂添加到Mo2C催化剂中可以帮助稳定丙烯形成的选择性位点。

文献并未讨论载体类型、载体表面积和金属负载量等变量如何影响这些催化剂中钒物种的性质和行为。相反，它侧重于钒掺杂对钼碳化物催化剂的影响，指出V掺杂导致表面相关碳和氧物种的贡献增加，并且最表层高度富集V。

总的来说，虽然该文档涉及了钒在烷烃脱氢催化剂中的一些方面，但并未对所提出的问题提供全面的回答。

[1] "Literature on catalytic propane dehydrogenation is dominated by supported Cr oxides11 and Pt-based systems.12 However, these catalysts are either rare and costly, or hazardous."

[2] "It is hoped that such materials may be able to substitute scarcer and more expensive noble metals in a growing field of applications, including fuel cells and energy-related catalysis."

[3] "The addition of V strongly influences the carburization temperature of the hexagonal h-Mo1xVxO3 precursors suggesting a stabilizing effect on the redox properties of the materials."

[4] "Thus, moderate doping with oxygen could also be a key factor for the reactivity in this system."

[5] "We recently reported on the synthesis of mesoporous V-doped Mo2C materials15 and it is well known that V exhibits a higher oxophilicity than Mo."

</quotes>

The exploration of vanadium oxide-based catalysts as alternatives to Pt and CrOx for paraffin dehydrogenation has been driven by several factors:

1. Cost and scarcity: Platinum-based catalysts are expensive and rare, while chromium oxide catalysts pose environmental hazards. Vanadium-based catalysts offer a potentially more cost-effective and environmentally friendly alternative.

2. Improved properties: Vanadium exhibits higher oxophilicity than molybdenum, which can lead to beneficial effects on catalyst stability and reactivity.

3. Versatility: Vanadium-doped catalysts show promise in various energy-related applications beyond just paraffin dehydrogenation.

Research in this area has evolved to focus on the development of mixed metal carbides, particularly vanadium-doped molybdenum carbides. These materials have shown improved carburization temperatures and stabilizing effects on redox properties.

Variables such as carrier type, support surface area, and metal loading influence the nature and behavior of vanadium species in these catalysts by affecting:

1. Surface area and dispersion of active sites
2. Interaction between vanadium and support material
3. Oxidation state and coordination environment of vanadium species
4. Stability and resistance to coking

However, the provided literature does not offer specific details on how these variables impact vanadium species. Further research would be needed to fully understand the relationships between these factors and catalyst performance.

探索以钒氧化物为基础的催化剂作为铂和氧化铬催化剂在烷烃脱氢反应中的替代品，主要受以下因素驱动：

1. 成本和稀缺性：铂基催化剂昂贵且稀有，而氧化铬催化剂存在环境危害。钒基催化剂可能提供更具成本效益和环境友好的替代方案。

2. 性能改进：钒比钼具有更高的亲氧性，这可能对催化剂的稳定性和反应性产生有益影响。

3. 多功能性：掺钒催化剂在烷烃脱氢之外的多种能源相关应用中也显示出潜力。

这一领域的研究已经发展到聚焦于开发混合金属碳化物，特别是掺钒的钼碳化物。这些材料表现出改进的碳化温度和对氧化还原性质的稳定效果。

载体类型、载体表面积和金属负载量等变量通过以下方式影响这些催化剂中钒物种的性质和行为：

1. 活性位的表面积和分散度
2. 钒与载体材料之间的相互作用
3. 钒物种的氧化态和配位环境
4. 抗结焦稳定性

然而，所提供的文献并未给出这些变量如何影响钒物种的具体细节。需要进行进一步研究以充分理解这些因素与催化剂性能之间的关系。
