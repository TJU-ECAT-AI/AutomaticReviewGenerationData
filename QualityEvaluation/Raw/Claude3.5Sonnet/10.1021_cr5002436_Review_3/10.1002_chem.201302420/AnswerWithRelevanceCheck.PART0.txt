          [1] "Literature on catalytic propane dehydrogenation is dominated by supported Cr oxides11 and Pt-based systems.12 However, these catalysts are either rare and costly, or hazardous."

          [2] "We recently studied the formation mechanism of hcp β-Mo2C by carburization of hexagonal molybdenum oxide as well as the impact of its V doping (3 to 11%)."

          [3] "The addition of V strongly influences the carburization temperature of the hexagonal h-Mo1xVxO3 precursors suggesting a stabilizing effect on the redox properties of the materials."

          [4] "Two strategies of stabilization of the selective sites for propylene formation have been proposed in the present work: i) the addition of mildly oxidizing H2O or CO2 to the feed (the latter is rapidly converted to H2O via rWGS), and ii) the addition of V as an oxophilic dopant for the Mo2C catalyst."

          [5] "It is hoped that such materials may be able to substitute scarcer and more expensive noble metals in a growing field of applications, including fuel cells and energy-related catalysis."

          [6] "We recently reported on the synthesis of mesoporous V-doped Mo2C materials15 and it is well known that V exhibits a higher oxophilicity than Mo."

          The exploration of vanadium oxide-based catalysts as alternatives to Pt and CrOx for paraffin dehydrogenation has been driven by several factors:

          1. Cost and scarcity: Platinum-based catalysts are expensive and rare, while chromium oxide catalysts pose environmental hazards. Vanadium-based catalysts offer a potentially more cost-effective and environmentally friendly alternative.

          2. Improved properties: Vanadium exhibits higher oxophilicity than molybdenum, which can lead to beneficial effects on catalyst stability and reactivity. The addition of vanadium strongly influences the carburization temperature of molybdenum oxide precursors, suggesting a stabilizing effect on the redox properties of the materials.

          3. Versatility: Vanadium-doped catalysts show promise in various energy-related applications beyond just paraffin dehydrogenation.

          Research in this area has evolved to focus on the development of mixed metal carbides, particularly vanadium-doped molybdenum carbides. These materials have shown improved carburization temperatures and stabilizing effects on redox properties. The addition of vanadium as an oxophilic dopant has been proposed as a strategy to stabilize selective sites for propylene formation in Mo2C catalysts.

          However, the provided literature does not offer a comprehensive historical overview of the evolution of research in this area since the 1980s. It also does not provide specific details on how variables such as carrier type, support surface area, and metal loading influence the nature and behavior of vanadium species in these catalysts. Further research would be needed to fully understand the relationships between these factors and catalyst performance.

          探索以钒氧化物为基础的催化剂作为铂和氧化铬催化剂在烷烃脱氢反应中的替代品，主要受以下因素驱动：

          1. 成本和稀缺性：铂基催化剂昂贵且稀有，而氧化铬催化剂存在环境危害。钒基催化剂可能提供更具成本效益和环境友好的替代方案。

          2. 性能改进：钒比钼具有更高的亲氧性，这可能对催化剂的稳定性和反应性产生有益影响。钒的添加强烈影响钼氧化物前体的碳化温度，表明对材料的氧化还原性质具有稳定作用。

          3. 多功能性：掺钒催化剂在烷烃脱氢之外的多种能源相关应用中也显示出潜力。

          这一领域的研究已经发展到聚焦于开发混合金属碳化物，特别是掺钒的钼碳化物。这些材料表现出改进的碳化温度和对氧化还原性质的稳定效果。将钒作为亲氧性掺杂剂添加被提议作为一种策略，以稳定Mo2C催化剂中丙烯生成的选择性位点。

          然而，所提供的文献并未提供自1980年代以来该领域研究演变的全面历史概述。它也没有提供关于载体类型、载体表面积和金属负载量等变量如何影响这些催化剂中钒物种的性质和行为的具体细节。需要进行进一步研究以充分理解这些因素与催化剂性能之间的关系。
