[1] "Literature on catalytic propane dehydrogenation is dominated by supported Cr oxides11 and Pt-based systems.12 However, these catalysts are either rare and costly, or hazardous."

[2] "We recently studied the formation mechanism of hcp β-Mo2C by carburization of hexagonal molybdenum oxide as well as the impact of its V doping (3 to 11%)."

[3] "The addition of V strongly influences the carburization temperature of the hexagonal h-Mo1xVxO3 precursors suggesting a stabilizing effect on the redox properties of the materials."

[4] "Thus, moderate doping with oxygen could also be a key factor for the reactivity in this system."

The literature does not provide a comprehensive overview of the evolution of vanadium oxide-based catalysts for paraffin dehydrogenation since the 1980s. However, it does mention some factors driving exploration of alternatives to platinum and chromium oxide catalysts, namely that these traditional catalysts are either rare and costly, or hazardous.

The document discusses molybdenum carbide catalysts doped with vanadium as potential alternatives. It notes that vanadium doping influences the carburization temperature of molybdenum oxide precursors, suggesting it has a stabilizing effect on redox properties. The authors propose that moderate oxygen doping, facilitated by vanadium's higher oxophilicity compared to molybdenum, could be a key factor for reactivity in this catalytic system.

However, the literature does not provide detailed information on how variables like carrier type, support surface area, and metal loading influence vanadium species in these catalysts. The focus is primarily on molybdenum carbide catalysts with vanadium doping, rather than vanadium oxide catalysts specifically.

Given the limited information provided in the document, a comprehensive answer to the question as posed is not possible. More research focused specifically on the development of vanadium oxide catalysts for paraffin dehydrogenation would be needed to fully address the question.

这篇文献并没有提供自1980年代以来钒氧化物基催化剂在烷烃脱氢方面发展的全面概述。然而,它确实提到了一些推动探索替代铂和铬氧化物催化剂的因素,即这些传统催化剂要么稀有且昂贵,要么有害。

文档讨论了掺杂钒的碳化钼催化剂作为潜在的替代品。它指出,钒掺杂影响氧化钼前体的碳化温度,这表明它对氧化还原性质有稳定作用。作者提出,由钒比钼更高的亲氧性所促进的适度氧掺杂,可能是这种催化系统反应性的关键因素。

然而,文献并未提供关于载体类型、支撑体表面积和金属负载量等变量如何影响这些催化剂中钒物种的详细信息。重点主要是掺钒的碳化钼催化剂,而不是专门的钒氧化物催化剂。

鉴于文档中提供的信息有限,无法对所提出的问题给出全面的回答。需要更多专门针对钒氧化物催化剂在烷烃脱氢方面发展的研究,才能全面回答这个问题。
