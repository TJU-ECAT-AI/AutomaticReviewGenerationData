[1] "Since the early transition metal carbides were found to provide noble metal-like properties,1,2 there has been a renewed interest in these materials in the field of catalysis, especially so in the case of Group 5 and 6 carbides."

[2] "We recently studied the formation mechanism of hcp β-Mo2C by carburization of hexagonal molybdenum oxide as well as the impact of its V doping (3 to 11%)."

[3] "Two strategies of stabilization of the selective sites for propylene formation have been proposed in the present work: i) the addition of mildly oxidizing H2O or CO2 to the feed (the latter is rapidly converted to H2O via rWGS), and ii) the addition of V as an oxophilic dopant for the Mo2C catalyst."

The literature does not provide a comprehensive answer to the specific question about the evolution of research on vanadium oxide-based catalysts for paraffin dehydrogenation since the 1980s. However, it does mention some relevant information about transition metal carbides, including vanadium-doped molybdenum carbide catalysts:

1. There has been renewed interest in early transition metal carbides, especially Group 5 and 6 carbides, as catalysts with noble metal-like properties.

2. The researchers studied vanadium-doped molybdenum carbide (V-doped Mo2C) catalysts, with V doping levels of 3-11%.

3. Adding vanadium as an oxophilic dopant to Mo2C catalysts was proposed as a strategy to stabilize selective sites for propylene formation in propane dehydrogenation.

The document does not provide specific information about the evolution of research since the 1980s or the influence of variables such as carrier type, support surface area, and metal loading on vanadium species in these catalysts.

该文献并未对自1980年代以来钒氧化物基催化剂用于烷烃脱氢的研究演变提供全面回答。但是，它确实提到了一些关于过渡金属碳化物的相关信息，包括钒掺杂的钼碳化物催化剂：

1. 人们对早期过渡金属碳化物，尤其是第5和第6族碳化物作为具有类贵金属性质的催化剂产生了renewed兴趣。

2. 研究人员研究了钒掺杂的钼碳化物（V掺杂Mo2C）催化剂，V掺杂水平为3-11%。

3. 将钒作为亲氧性掺杂剂添加到Mo2C催化剂中被提出作为一种策略，以稳定丙烷脱氢反应中选择性生成丙烯的活性位点。

该文档没有提供自1980年代以来研究演变的具体信息，也没有提供载体类型、载体比表面积和金属负载量等变量对这些催化剂中钒物种的影响的信息。
