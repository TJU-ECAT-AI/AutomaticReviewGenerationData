<EnglishVersionAnswer>

The given literature does not contain any information about vanadium oxide-based catalysts or their development as alternatives to Pt and CrOx for paraffin dehydrogenation. The document focuses on molybdenum-based catalysts intercalated into hydrotalcite materials for propane dehydrogenation. It does not discuss vanadium catalysts, their historical development since the 1980s, or the influence of variables like carrier type, support surface area, and metal loading on vanadium species. Therefore, this question cannot be answered based on the provided literature.

给定的文献中不包含任何关于钒氧化物基催化剂或其作为Pt和CrOx替代品用于烷烃脱氢的发展信息。该文档主要讨论了嵌入水滑石材料中的钼基催化剂用于丙烷脱氢。它没有讨论钒催化剂、自1980年代以来的历史发展,或者载体类型、支撑体表面积和金属负载等变量对钒物种的影响。因此,无法根据提供的文献回答这个问题。
