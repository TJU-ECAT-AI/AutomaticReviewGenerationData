Read the questions and answers provided below. First, critically assess the overall relevance of the answers provided to the set of questions asked.

If, upon your assessment, you find that the answers do not contain information that is relevant to the questions asked, stop your review process immediately and respond with a single sentence: "※※※※※※※The provided answers are not relevant to the questions.※※※※※※※". Do not provide any additional explanation or background information, only this sentence should be given as a response in case of irrelevant answers.

If, however, the answers are relevant to the questions asked, proceed to compile answers for each question according to the instructions below. Ensure to aggregate all the relevant answers from the multiple answer results provided in the document, and organize them sequentially by their order number, compiling the corresponding quotes, English answers, and Chinese answers for each question.

If the provided answers' quotes are not differentiated by question, ensure to break them down and assign the quotes to each respective question, outputting them separately within each question's section.

To provide a comprehensive review, differentiate the responses into quotes, English answers, and Chinese answers for each question based on the details given in the 'Answer' XML tags. Structure your review using the XML format showcased below if the answers are relevant to the questions asked:

The given literature does not contain any information about vanadium oxide-based catalysts for paraffin dehydrogenation. The document focuses on molybdenum-based catalysts supported on hydrotalcite for propane dehydrogenation. It does not discuss vanadium catalysts, their development since the 1980s, or how variables like carrier type, surface area and metal loading influence vanadium species. The literature does not provide relevant information to answer this question.

The given literature does not contain any information about vanadium oxide-based catalysts or their development as alternatives to Pt and CrOx for paraffin dehydrogenation. The document focuses on molybdenum-based catalysts intercalated into hydrotalcite materials for propane dehydrogenation. It does not discuss vanadium catalysts, their historical development since the 1980s, or the influence of variables like carrier type, support surface area, and metal loading on vanadium species. Therefore, this question cannot be answered based on the provided literature.
