ABSTRACT
The conversion of propane into benzenic compounds was studied at 530C on a series of
GaHZSM5 catalysts prepared by impregnation of HZSM5 with a solution of gallium nitrate. Gal-
lium species increase the rate of propane conversion and the selectivity for aromatics. These spe-
cies have dehydrogenating activity, increasing both propane activation and
naphthene
aromatization. The conversion of propane into benzenic compounds on GaHZSM5 catalysts can
be considered, therefore, as a bifunctional process in which dehydrogenation reactions are cata-
lyzed by the gallium species and oligomerization and oligomer cyclization by the acid sites. The
active gallium species seem to be gallium oxide dispersed in the zeolite rather than gallium cations
in an exchange position.
INTRODUCTION
A catalytic process for converting propane or butane into aromatics has re-
cently been developed by British Petroleum in collaboration with Universal
Oil Products. This process, called Cyclar, uses a gallium-doped zeolite, the
cavities of which appear to be ideal for the formation of monoaromatics [1].
As Kitagawa et al. [2] have shown in the conversion of propane, the exchange
of HZSM5 by Ga3 + improves greatly the selectivity towards aromatics and

increases the rate of propane conversion. They stated that the role of gallium
species would be to increase the rate of aromatization of the lower olefins (steps
2, 4 and 5, Fig. 1); these species do not have a direct effect on the activation of
propane (step 1). However, this proposal (no role of gallium species in step 1)
seems to us to be questionable. Indeed, propene reacts much faster than pro-
pane, which indicates that step 1 has a limiting effect on propane conversion
and gallium species increase the rate of propane conversion.
It therefore seemed necessary to specify the role of gallium species in pro-
pane aromatization. For this we prepared a series of gallium catalysts by im-
pregnating HZSM5 with a solution of gallium nitrate and compared the
conversions of propene and propane on these catalysts and on HZSM5. The
distribution of all the products formed was examined for a wide range of con-
versions (about 5-80%).
EXPERIMENTAL
HZSM5 was synthesized according to Mobil Patents [3]. Its SijAl ratio,
obtained by chemical analysis at the Centre de Microanalyse CNRS, Vernai-
son, France, was 40.The zeolite was characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD),
scanning electron microscopy and nitrogen adsorption. The XRD pattern, the
zeolite morphology and the capacity for nitrogen adsorption agreed with the
literature data [4-6]. The zeolite crystal size was between 1and 3 J1m. Gallium
was introduced by treating HZSM5 by refluxing for 24 h a 0.1 M solution of
gallium nitrate (Aldrich Chemical; 99.999%), then eliminating water by evap-
oration. Three GaHZSM5 samples were prepared, containing 2, 4 and 6 wt.-%
of gallium, by using the appropriate volumes of gallium nitrate solution. Prior
to use, the catalysts were pretreated for 10 h at 530C under a flow of dry
nitrogen.
Nitrogen adsorption experiments were carried out at 77 K, the amounts ad-
sorbed being determined by microgravimetry. Catalyst acidity was character-
ized by ammonia thermal desorption. The catalyst was pretreated at 500C
under a flow of helium, cooled to 50C, evacuated, then saturated with am-
157
monia, the excess ammonia being removed under vacuum. Desorption was then
carried out under a flow of helium, by increasing the temperature in 50 c C
steps. The amount of ammonia desorbed at each temperature was determined
by gas chromatography with a thermal conductivity detector.
Propane and propene conversions were carried out in a flow reactor at 530 c C,
1 bar hydrocarbon pressure and catalyst weight 0.03-0.2 g. n-Heptane and
cyclohexene conversions were carried out in a flow reactor at normal pressure
withp(N2 ) /p(hydrocarbon) =9 and at 450 and 200C, respectively. The con-
ditions of the chromatographic analysis have been reported elsewhere [7]. The
reproducibility of the experiments was checked for each type of conversion.
There was roughly a 10% margin of error in the measurement of the activity.
RESULTS
Three samples of GaHZ8M5 catalysts were prepared; we shall call them
xGaHZ8M5, where x indicates the weight percentage of gallium in the cata-
lysts (2-6 wt.-%).

Catalyst characterization
For the HZSM5 sample used here (SijAl=40), complete exchange by gal-
lium species would be obtained with a gallium content of about 1 wt.-% (if it
is accepted that one gallium cation replaces three monovalent cations). In all
the samples, therefore, part of the gallium species is not in the form of Ga3 +
cation but probably in the form of gallium oxide, which results from thermal
decomposition of gallium nitrate (about 50% for 2GaHZSM5, 75% for
4GaHZSM5 and 85% for 6GaHZSM5).
The introduction of gallium causes a slight decrease in the zeolite capacity
for nitrogen adsorption: 0.155 cm3g- 1 for 6GaHZSM5 compared with 0.18
cm3g- 1 for HZSM5. Almost no change is observed in the zeolite acidity, the
ammonia thermal desorption spectra of HZSM5 and of 6GaHZSM5 being al-
most identical (Fig. 2).
The activity of HZSM5 and of 6GaHZSM5 are very similar (Table 1), both
for a reaction requiring strong acid sites (n-heptane cracking) and for a reac-
tion that can be catalysed by weak acid sites (cyclohexene isomerization to
methylcyclopentenes ). Moreover, the selectivities are also similar.
Propane conversion
The rate of propane conversion increases with increasing gallium content
(Fig. 3). Deactivation is always very slow. This stability can be related to the
low rate of coke formation; this rate is 80 (HZSM5) to 250 times (GaHZSM5)
lower than the rate of propane conversion.
On all the catalysts, the main products observed are methane, ethene and
propene, formed directly from propane, and ethane, butanes, butenes, Cs-Cs
aliphatic or alicyclic compounds (about 90% C, and 10% Cs) and Cs-Cs aro-
matics, resulting from the secondary conversion of propene and ethene (Figs.
4 and 5). The yields of propene, ethene, butanes, butenes and Cs-Cs aliphatic
and alicyclic compounds pass through a maximum, indicating that all these
compounds undergo secondary conversions. Great differences are observed be-
tween the product distributions on HZSM5 and on the GaHZSM5 catalysts:
(i ) Gallium increases the initial production of propene (Fig. 4). Thus, for a
5% propane conversion, the yield of propene on 6GaHZSM5 is double that on
HZSM5. However, the secondary conversions of propene are also faster on
GaHZSM5 catalysts. Consequently, on these catalysts the maximal yield of
propene is lower and obtained for lower conversion values (Fig. 4).
(ii ) Gallium decreases the selectivity with respect to methane, ethane, eth-
ene, butanes, butenes and Cs-Cs aliphatic and alicyclic compounds and in-
creases significantly the selectivity for Cs-Cs aromatics (Fig. 5).
(iii) Whereas on HZSM5 the butene distribution is similar to that of ther-
modynamic equilibrium even at low conversion, the introduction of gallium
causes a decrease in I-butene production and an increase in 2-butene produc-
tion; moreover, traces of butadiene can be observed on GaHZSM5. The iso-

butane/ri-butane ratio is higher on GaHZSM5 than on HZSM5. When the

aromatic yield increases, the benzene selectivity increases at the expense of
the selectivity for toluene and Cs aromatics.
Propene conversion
On all the catalysts, with or without gallium, the propene conversion is much
faster than the propane conversion, the difference in activity decreasing with
increasing gallium content (about 30times on HZSM5 compared with 10times
on GaHZSM5 ). Gallium catalysts seem to be slightly more active than HZSM5
(about 1.1 times). Deactivation is always very slow.
The reaction products are the same as obtained in propane conversion but
the distributions are different; in particular, for the same conversion value, on
both HZSM5 and GaHZSM5 (Fig. 7) the production of butenes and of C5-C7
non-aromatics (C5+ ) is greater from propene whereas that of methane, ethane
and aromatics is smaller. Non-aromatic C5 + products, butenes and ethene are
apparently formed directly from propene whereas the primary products of pro-
pane conversion are propene, ethene and methane. The percentage of C5 +
products and butenes passes through a maximum, showing that these com-
pounds undergo secondary reactions. The main products resulting from their
transformations are Cs-Cs aromatic hydrocarbons, propane and butanes.
Methane and ethane are formed in very small amounts and only at very high
conversion.
Gallium has almost no effect on the formation of methane, ethane, ethene,
propane, butenes or butanes, but causes a decrease in the production of C5 +
non-aromatics and an increase in the production of aromatics (Fig. 8). No
significant change is observed in the butene distribution (equilibrium is ob-
tained for conversion values higher than 40%) or in the C5 + non-aromatics:

is higher on gallium catalysts than on HZSM5: e.g., at 25% conversion, 1.4 on
6GaHZSM5 compared with 1 on HZSM5; at 80% conversion, 1.9 on
6GaHZSM5 compared with 1.4 on HZSM5.
The aromatic hydrocarbon distribution depends slightly on the gallium con-
tent but very much on the conversion. The toluene percentage increases with
increasing conversion, the Cs aromatics percentage decreases and the benzene
percentage remains almost constant.
DISCUSSION
This study confirms that gallium species increase the activity of HZSM5 for
propane conversion and especially the selectivity for aromatic products. The
rate of propene conversion is not much affected but the selectivity of aromatic
products is increased significantly. As has already been shown [2], the effect
of gallium is not due to a change in HZSM5 acidity. Indeed, no modification
in the ammonia thermal desorption spectrum was observed (Fig. 2) or in the
activity and in the selectivity of HZSM5 for model reactions (Table 1). We
shall show what the steps of the reaction scheme (Fig. 1) in which gallium
species intervene are and what their role is.
Fig. 4 shows that gallium species affect the conversion of propane into pro-
pene (step 1). Indeed, if propene and an equimolar mixture of methane (C1 )
and ethylene (C2-) are always the primary products, the propene selectivity at
164
lowconversion levels increases significantly with increasing gallium content,
whereas the C1+C2- selectivity decreases. We can consider then that gallium
species increase the rate of conversion of propane into propene without affect-
ing the rate of propane scission. Gallium species are therefore able to dehydro-
genate propane to propene or to increase the rate of propene formation on the
acid sites ofHZSM5. This hypothesis is unlikely, as the introduction of gallium
in HZSM5 does not cause any change in its acidity. On the other hand, dehy-
drogenating activity of gallium oxide has been observed previously [8]. The
dehydrogenating activity of gallium oxide also explains the results obtained by
Simmons et al. [9] in n-butane cracking. Gallium oxide formed by hydrother-
mal treatment of GaHZSM5 or added to HZSM5 increases considerably the
activity and the selectivity for olefin formation. This is probably due to dehy-
drogenation of butane on gallium oxide: the butenes formed are indeed most
reactive for cracking and their scission leads to olefinic products. If gallium
species are, like platinum, able to dehydrogenate propane to propene, their
activity is much lower; indeed, with 0.5 wt.-% platinum on HZSM5, equilib-
rium between propane and propene (about 25% propene for 75% propane)
could be obtained [7], in contrast to GaHZSM5 catalysts (at the maximum
4% propene for 96% propane on 6GaHZSM5).
However, if gallium species increase the rate of propene formation they cause
also an apparent increase in its consumption. Indeed, the maximal yield of
propene is lower with GaHZSM5 than with HZSM5 (Fig. 4). This phenome-
non is also observed for the other olefinic products (ethene and butenes) and
for the C5 + aliphatic or alicyclic compounds. On the other hand, the formation
of aromatics is considerably favoured (Fig. 4). All these observations can be
explained if we consider the reaction scheme in Fig. 1. On HZSM5, reactions
2-5 are catalysed by the acid sites. Steps 2 and 2' are the reverse steps of
cracking of aliphatic olefins and step 4 is the reverse step of naphthene crack-
ing; at 530C, oligomers and C6-CS alicyclics are very much thermodynami-
cally unfavoured. Step 5, which occurs through hydrogen transfer from C6 +
alicyclic compounds to light olefins, e.g.
u
+
3C=C-C
-
3C-C-C
+ U
is almost irreversible under the operating conditions used. This step, which
requires numerous bimolecular reactions involving bulky transition states, is
probably limited by the steric constraints exerted by the narrow pore structure
of HZSM5. This is not the case for oligomerization (steps 2 and 2' ) or for the
cyclization of C6-CS compounds (step 4), the intermediates involved being
smaller. Consequently, on HZSM5 we can consider that during propane con-
version a quasi-equilibrium exists between light olefins, oligomers and C6-CS
alicyclic compounds (the amount of the last compounds being very small be-
cause of the thermodynamic equilibrium). Gallium species would playa sig-
165
nificant role in step 5,catalysing dehydrogenation of C6-Csalicycliccompounds
into aromatics, e.g.
Step 5 then occurs faster and the production of aromatics increases at the
expense of the production of olefins. The production of light alkanes, which
occurs mainly through hydrogen transfer, also decreases (Fig. 5).
However, this increase in the rate of step 5 caused by gallium species should
result in a significant increase in the rate of conversion of propene. This is not
so: the rate of propene conversion increases only very slightly. This can be
explained by the fact that propene is converted not only through the successive
steps 2, 4 and 5, but also through other reactions such as disproportionation
into ethene and butenes, reactions which are catalysed by the acid sites (with-
out the intervention of gallium species). Ifonly the conversion of propene into
aromatics (steps 2, 4 and 5) is considered, the effect of gallium species is more
pronounced; thus 6GaHZSM5 is about three times more active than HZSM5.
The butene and butane selectivities on HZSM5 and on GaHZSM5 are very
different: the percentage of I-butene in the butene mixture is lower on Ga-
HZSM5 than on HZSM5, traces of butadiene are observed on GaHZSM5 and
the isobutane/n-butane ratio is higher on GaHZSM5 than on HZSM5. All
these observations can be explained by dehydrogenation of I-butene to buta-
diene on gallium species, the latter being rapidly consumed by secondary con-
version on the acid sites. This formation of dienes on gallium species could also
playa role in increasing the rate of formation of aromatics.
CONCLUSION
Owing to their dehydrogenating activity, gallium species increase the rate
and the selectivity ofpropane aromatization. On GaHZSM5 catalysts, propane
aromatization can be considered as a bifunctional process, as reported by Weisz
[10], gallium species catalysing step 1 (propane activation) and step 5 (C6-
C, alicyclic compound aromatization) of the reaction scheme and the acid sites
of HZSM5 catalysing steps 2-4. The role played in C6-Cs aromatization is
particularly significant because on gallium species this step occurs without the
simultaneous production oflight alkanes, as occurs on the acid sites (hydrogen
transfer reaction). It is most unlikely that the active species are gallium cat-
ions in an exchange position, because (i) introduction of gallium in HZSM5
does not cause any change in acidity and (ii) the activity continues to increase
with gallium content beyond the value necessary for the complete exchange of
166
HZSM5. The active species could be gallium oxide, resulting from decompo-
sition of gallium nitrate and well dispersed on (or in) the HZSM5 zeolite.
