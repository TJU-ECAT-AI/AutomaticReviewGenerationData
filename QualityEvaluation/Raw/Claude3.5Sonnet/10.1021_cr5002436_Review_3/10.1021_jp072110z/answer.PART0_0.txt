The given literature does not contain any information relevant to vanadium oxide-based catalysts for paraffin dehydrogenation. The text focuses on gallium-based catalysts in zeolites for ethane dehydrogenation, particularly examining the mechanisms and energetics of reactions involving gallyl (GaO+) ions. It does not discuss vanadium oxide catalysts, their development since the 1980s, or the influence of variables like carrier type, surface area, and metal loading on vanadium species. Therefore, this question cannot be answered based on the provided document.

给定的文献不包含任何关于钒氧化物基催化剂用于烷烃脱氢的相关信息。该文本主要集中讨论了沸石中基于镓的催化剂对乙烷脱氢的作用,特别是研究了涉及镓基(GaO+)离子的反应机理和能量学。它没有讨论钒氧化物催化剂、自20世纪80年代以来的发展,或者载体类型、表面积和金属负载量等变量对钒物种的影响。因此,无法根据提供的文档回答这个问题。
