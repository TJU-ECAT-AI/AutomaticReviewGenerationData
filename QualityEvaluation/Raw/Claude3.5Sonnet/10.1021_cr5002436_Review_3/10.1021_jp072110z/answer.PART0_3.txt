The given scientific literature does not contain any information about vanadium oxide-based catalysts for paraffin dehydrogenation. The document focuses on gallium-based catalysts, specifically gallyl ions (GaO+) in Ga/ZSM-5 zeolites, for ethane dehydrogenation. It does not mention vanadium oxide catalysts or their development since the 1980s. The literature also does not discuss variables such as carrier type, support surface area, or metal loading in relation to vanadium species. Therefore, this question cannot be answered based on the provided document.

给定的科学文献中没有包含关于用于烷烃脱氢的钒氧化物催化剂的任何信息。该文档主要讨论了用于乙烷脱氢的镓基催化剂，特别是Ga/ZSM-5沸石中的镓离子(GaO+)。它没有提到钒氧化物催化剂或自20世纪80年代以来它们的发展。文献也没有讨论载体类型、载体表面积或金属负载量等变量与钒物种的关系。因此，基于提供的文档无法回答这个问题。
