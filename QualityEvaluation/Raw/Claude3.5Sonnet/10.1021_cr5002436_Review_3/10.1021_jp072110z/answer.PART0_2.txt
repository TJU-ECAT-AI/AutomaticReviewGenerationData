The given literature does not contain any information relevant to answering the question about vanadium oxide-based catalysts for paraffin dehydrogenation. The document focuses on gallium-based catalysts in ZSM-5 zeolites for ethane dehydrogenation, and does not mention vanadium oxide catalysts or their development since the 1980s. There is no discussion of variables like carrier type, support surface area, or metal loading influencing vanadium species. The question cannot be answered based on the information provided in this document.
