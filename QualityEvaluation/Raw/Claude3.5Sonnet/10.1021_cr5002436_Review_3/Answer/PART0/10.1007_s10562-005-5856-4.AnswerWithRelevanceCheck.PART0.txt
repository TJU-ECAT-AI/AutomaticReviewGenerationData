          [1] "From environmental points of view, the authors have focused attention on gallium oxide-based catalysts for developing high performance catalysts not containing chromium for the dehydrogenation of propane."

          [2] "In the present study, the dehydrogenation of propane over a silica-supported vanadium oxide catalyst was investigated."

          [3] "The content of vanadium oxide in the catalyst was 5 wt%. The molar content of vanadium oxide in the catalyst was 1.7 mol%. The surface area of the catalyst was 350 m2/g."

          The literature does not provide a comprehensive overview of the evolution of vanadium oxide catalyst research since the 1980s or extensively discuss factors driving exploration of these catalysts as alternatives to Pt and CrOx. However, it does mention that environmental concerns have motivated research into non-chromium catalysts, including gallium oxide-based and vanadium oxide-based catalysts, for propane dehydrogenation.

          The study focuses specifically on a silica-supported vanadium oxide catalyst. Some key variables mentioned that influence the catalyst's properties include:

          1. Support type: Silica was used as the support material.
          2. Support surface area: The catalyst had a surface area of 350 m2/g.
          3. Metal loading: The catalyst contained 5 wt% vanadium oxide (1.7 mol%).

          While the paper does not extensively discuss how these variables impact the nature and behavior of vanadium species, it does examine how the catalyst performs under different conditions (presence/absence of CO2) and how the oxidation state of vanadium changes during the reaction.

          该文献并未提供自1980年代以来钒氧化物催化剂研究演变的全面概述，也没有广泛讨论推动这些催化剂作为铂和铬氧化物替代品探索的因素。然而，它确实提到环境考虑因素促使研究人员开发不含铬的催化剂，包括氧化镓基和钒氧化物基催化剂，用于丙烷脱氢。

          该研究主要关注硅胶负载的钒氧化物催化剂。提到的一些影响催化剂性能的关键变量包括：

          1. 载体类型：使用硅胶作为载体材料。
          2. 载体表面积：催化剂的表面积为350 m2/g。
          3. 金属负载量：催化剂含有5 wt%的钒氧化物（1.7 mol%）。

          虽然该论文没有广泛讨论这些变量如何影响钒物种的性质和行为，但它确实研究了催化剂在不同条件下（有/无CO2存在）的表现，以及钒的氧化态在反应过程中如何变化。
