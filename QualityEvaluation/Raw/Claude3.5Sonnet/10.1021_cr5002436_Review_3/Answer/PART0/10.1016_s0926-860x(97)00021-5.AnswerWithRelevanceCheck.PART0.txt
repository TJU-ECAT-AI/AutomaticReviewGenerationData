          [1] "In recent years, such supported vanadia catalysts have found wide commercial application as oxidation catalysts: selective oxidation of o-xylene to phthalic anhydride [6,7], ammoxidation of alkyl aromatics [8,9], selective catalytic reduction of NOx with NH3 [ 10] and controlling the oxidation of SO2 to SO3 during SCR [ 10-12]. In addition to these oxidation reactions, supported vanadia catalysts have also been investigated for the oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes to olefins [ 13], oxidation of butane to maleic anhydride [ 14-17], pentane oxidation to maleic anhydride [18] and the selective oxidation of methanol to formaldehyde [19] or methyl formate [20]."

[2] "The oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propylene over V2Os/Nb2Os was not dependent on the concentration of the bridging V-O-V bonds [94]. For hydrocarbon oxidation reactions where the TOF increases with surface vanadia coverage it is not clear if this trend is due to an increase in the surface concentration of bridging V-O-V bonds or other factors (e.g., surface acidity, lateral interactions, number of active sites, etc.). The TOFs for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propylene and butane to butene over V2Os/A1203 were found to increase with surface vanadia coverage, by as much as an order of magnitude, suggesting that other factors may also play a role for alumina supported vanadia catalysts [13,95,96]."

[3] "The characteristics of the bridging V-O-support bond can be altered by varying the specific oxide support or oxide support ligands without changing the structure of the surface vanadia species (with the exception of silica). The bridging V-O-support bond appears to be associated with the critical oxygen required for hydrocarbon oxidation reactions since changing the specific oxide support dramatically affects the TOF: approximately four orders of magnitude for methanol oxidation to formaldehyde [19] and two-orders of magnitude for butane oxidation to maleic anhydride [36]. The general trend appears to be CeOz>ZrO2 TiO2>NbzOs>A12Os>SiO2, which inversely correlates with the Sanderson electronegativity of the oxide support cations [97]."

[4] "Monolayer surface coverage of the vanadia overlayer on different oxide supports was recently determined from Raman spectroscopy measurements and found to be approximately 7-8 VOx per nm2 [5,19]. The same monolayer surface VOx coverage was found for different oxide supports (A1203, TiO2, ZrO2, Nb205 and CeO2) with the exception of silica supported vanadia, which exhibited a maximum surface coverage of only 0.7 VOx per nm2."

[5] "The specific phase of the oxide support as well as the specific preparation method do not appear to influence the molecular structure or reactivity of the surface vanadia species."

          The exploration of vanadium oxide-based catalysts as alternatives to Pt and CrOx for paraffin dehydrogenation has been driven by several factors:

1. Versatility: Supported vanadia catalysts have found wide commercial application in various oxidation reactions, including the oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes to olefins.

2. Performance: Research since the 1980s has evolved to investigate the use of supported vanadia catalysts in multiple reactions, such as oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propylene and butane to butene.

3. Support influence: The type of carrier or support significantly influences the nature and behavior of vanadium species. The bridging V-O-support bond is critical for hydrocarbon oxidation reactions, with the reactivity trend following CeO2 > ZrO2 > TiO2 > Nb2O5 > Al2O3 > SiO2.

4. Surface area and metal loading: These variables affect the surface concentration of vanadia species and the ratio of isolated to polymerized species. The turnover frequency (TOF) for some reactions, like propane and butane dehydrogenation on V2O5/Al2O3, increases with surface vanadia coverage.

5. Structure-activity relationships: Research has focused on understanding how the molecular structure of surface vanadia species influences catalytic activity, with factors such as bridging V-O-V bonds, surface acidity, and lateral interactions playing roles in determining catalyst performance.

6. Monolayer coverage: The monolayer surface coverage of vanadia on different oxide supports (except silica) is approximately 7-8 VOx per nm2, which affects the catalytic properties.

7. Preparation methods: The specific preparation method does not significantly influence the molecular structure or reactivity of the surface vanadia species, providing flexibility in catalyst synthesis.

These factors have contributed to the ongoing research and development of vanadium oxide-based catalysts as potential alternatives to traditional catalysts in various oxidation and dehydrogenation reactions.

          作为铂和氧化铬催化剂在烷烃脱氢反应中的替代品，钒氧化物基催化剂的研究受到以下因素的推动：

1. 多功能性：负载型钒氧化物催化剂在各种氧化反应中有广泛的商业应用，包括烷烃到烯烃的氧化脱氢反应。

2. 性能：自20世纪80年代以来，研究已经发展到探索负载型钒氧化物催化剂在多种反应中的应用，如丙烷到丙烯和丁烷到丁烯的氧化脱氢反应。

3. 载体影响：载体或支撑材料的类型对钒物种的性质和行为有显著影响。V-O-载体桥键对碳氢化合物氧化反应至关重要，反应活性趋势为CeO2 > ZrO2 > TiO2 > Nb2O5 > Al2O3 > SiO2。

4. 比表面积和金属负载量：这些变量影响钒氧化物物种的表面浓度以及孤立物种与聚合物种的比例。某些反应（如V2O5/Al2O3上的丙烷和丁烷脱氢）的转化频率（TOF）随表面钒氧化物覆盖率的增加而增加。

5. 结构-活性关系：研究重点是了解表面钒氧化物物种的分子结构如何影响催化活性，其中V-O-V桥键、表面酸度和侧向相互作用等因素在决定催化剂性能方面起着重要作用。

6. 单层覆盖：钒氧化物在不同氧化物载体上的单层表面覆盖度（除二氧化硅外）约为每平方纳米7-8个VOx，这影响了催化性能。

7. 制备方法：具体的制备方法对表面钒物种的分子结构或反应活性没有显著影响，为催化剂合成提供了灵活性。

这些因素促进了钒氧化物基催化剂作为各种氧化和脱氢反应中传统催化剂潜在替代品的持续研究和开发。
