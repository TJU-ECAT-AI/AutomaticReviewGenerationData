          [1] "Of several catalysts, supported group 5 and 6 metal oxides, typically VOx, (101, 132, 133) NbOx, (134) CrOx, (18, 127) MoOx, and WOx, (135) are particularly interesting."

[2] "The best catalyst used for the oxidative dehydrogenation of alkane (ODH), and typically that of propane, is based on VOx supported on oxide materials, (98, 130, 131, 133) but MoOx supported catalysts are becoming competitive."

[3] "These systems are characterized by the presence of isolated sites or small clusters at a low surface coverage; with bulk oxides being formed only at higher surface coverage (above a monolayer)."

[4] "While leading to very different products, these reactions have common reaction intermediates and have the same rate determining step, i.e. CH bond activation."

[5] "Independently of the catalysts and the reactions, the CH bond activation is often the rate determining step."

[6] "Despite years of research, the yields are still limited, and this reaction needs to operate at low conversions to avoid large amounts of overoxidation products (COx)."

[7] "Overall, silica can be regarded as the optimal support in terms of selectivity. Another important fact is that the optimal temperature window for this process is quite narrow, and around 500 C, lower temperatures favor combustion while unselective gas phase reactions start to be competitive at higher temperatures (>550 C)."

          Research on vanadium oxide-based catalysts for paraffin dehydrogenation has been driven by the need to find alternatives to platinum and chromium oxide catalysts since the 1980s. The exploration has focused on supported group 5 and 6 metal oxides, with vanadium oxide (VOx) emerging as a leading candidate, particularly for oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes like propane.

Key factors driving this exploration include:
1. The ability to form isolated sites or small clusters at low surface coverage, with bulk oxides only forming at higher coverage.
2. Superior performance in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions, particularly for propane, compared to traditional catalysts.
3. Common reaction intermediates and rate-determining steps (CH bond activation) across different reactions, allowing for mechanistic insights.

Variables influencing vanadium species behavior include:
1. Carrier type: The choice of oxide support material affects dispersion and interactions. Silica has been identified as the optimal support in terms of selectivity.
2. Support surface area: Higher surface areas generally allow for better dispersion of active sites.
3. Metal loading: Impacts whether isolated sites, small clusters, or bulk oxides form.
4. Temperature: The optimal temperature window is narrow, around 500°C. Lower temperatures favor combustion, while higher temperatures (>550°C) lead to unselective gas-phase reactions.

The evolution of research in this area has led to a better understanding of catalyst structure and composition. Despite years of research, challenges remain in optimizing yield and selectivity, particularly in avoiding the formation of undesired COx products. The reaction typically needs to operate at low conversions to avoid overoxidation.

Ongoing research continues to focus on fine-tuning catalyst composition and structure to improve performance in paraffin dehydrogenation reactions, balancing activity with product selectivity and catalyst stability.

          自20世纪80年代以来,对钒氧化物基催化剂用于烷烃脱氢的研究一直致力于寻找铂和铬氧化物催化剂的替代品。研究重点集中在负载的第5和第6族金属氧化物上,其中钒氧化物(VOx)成为领先的候选者,特别是用于烷烃(如丙烷)的氧化脱氢。

推动这一探索的关键因素包括:
1. 在低表面覆盖率下能够形成孤立位点或小簇,只有在更高覆盖率下才形成块状氧化物。
2. 与传统催化剂相比,在氧化脱氢反应中表现出色,特别是对于丙烷。
3. 不同反应中具有共同的反应中间体和决速步骤(CH键活化),允许进行机理洞察。

影响钒物种行为的变量包括:
1. 载体类型:氧化物支撑材料的选择影响分散性和相互作用。二氧化硅在选择性方面被确定为最佳载体。
2. 支撑体表面积:较高的表面积通常允许活性位点更好地分散。
3. 金属负载量:影响是否形成孤立位点、小簇或块状氧化物。
4. 温度:最佳温度窗口很窄,约为500°C。较低的温度有利于燃烧,而较高的温度(>550°C)会导致非选择性的气相反应。

该领域研究的演变使我们对催化剂结构和成分有了更好的理解。尽管经过多年的研究,在优化产率和选择性方面仍然存在挑战,特别是在避免形成不需要的COx产物方面。反应通常需要在低转化率下进行以避免过度氧化。

持续的研究继续关注微调催化剂组成和结构,以改善烷烃脱氢反应的性能,平衡活性、产品选择性和催化剂稳定性。
