          "The effect of CO2 on the yield of ethane with V2O5 in the presence of CO2 was slightly detrimental."

[1] "Literature on catalytic propane dehydrogenation is dominated by supported Cr oxides11 and Pt-based systems.12 However, these catalysts are either rare and costly, or hazardous."

          [2] "We recently studied the formation mechanism of hcp Î²-Mo2C by carburization of hexagonal molybdenum oxide as well as the impact of its V doping (3 to 11%)."

          [3] "The addition of V strongly influences the carburization temperature of the hexagonal h-Mo1xVxO3 precursors suggesting a stabilizing effect on the redox properties of the materials."

          [4] "Two strategies of stabilization of the selective sites for propylene formation have been proposed in the present work: i) the addition of mildly oxidizing H2O or CO2 to the feed (the latter is rapidly converted to H2O via rWGS), and ii) the addition of V as an oxophilic dopant for the Mo2C catalyst."

          [5] "It is hoped that such materials may be able to substitute scarcer and more expensive noble metals in a growing field of applications, including fuel cells and energy-related catalysis."

          [6] "We recently reported on the synthesis of mesoporous V-doped Mo2C materials15 and it is well known that V exhibits a higher oxophilicity than Mo."

[1] "The catalytic dehydrogenation and oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of light alkanes is an important route to the formation of alkenes and alkadienes, important precursors for fuels, plastics and many other materials. In particular, a substantial body of research has focused on supported VOx catalysts for ODH reactions [16]."

[2] "Recently, studies have investigated the direct dehydrogenation of light alkanes over supported VOx catalysts in the absence of gas-phase oxygen where a different reaction mechanism must operate [711]."

[3] "As vanadium loading increases, so does the domain size of the supported vanadate units with significant quantities of V2O5 observed at the highest loadings."

[4] "As the vanadia loading increases, polyvanadate and crystalline V2O5 become the dominant vanadia species representing 60% and 10%, respectively of vanadium on the surface of 3.5 V. At higher loadings the fraction of V2O5 increases, reaching 30% on 8 V consistent with 51V MAS NMR results reported herein."

[5] "From these data it is possible to determine structureactivity relationships, with polymeric vanadia clusters favouring the formation of butenes and butadienes, while more isolated species are highly active towards the formation of polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbons retained on the catalyst surface post-reaction."

[6] "As expected, the measured surface area decreases with increasing vanadium loading, from 104 m2 g1 for 1 V to 77 m2 g1 for 8 V."

[7] "Calcination temperature is known to strongly influence catalyst structure and therefore catalytic performance [21,22]."

[1] "Recently, we have demonstrated that the VOx/MCM-41 catalyst with highly dispersed, near to isolated VOx species showed similar selectivity and, most importantly, stable catalytic performance in several DH/regeneration cycles surpassing in quality the industrially relevant CrOx/MCM-41 and PtSn/Al2O3."

[2] "The aim of the current work was to further explore the potential of VOx-based catalysts for the DH reaction. To this end, we selected commercial Al2O3SiO2 materials (Siral), pure Al2O3 and SiO2 as supports to prepare catalysts free of crystalline V2O5 particles."

[3] "Al2O3, SiO2(MCM-41), and Al2O3SiO2 (Siral) with a SiO2 content varying from 1 to 70 wt.% were used to prepare supported catalysts with a V loading below one monolayer."

[4] "As the surface density of V increases, the red shift of the CT onset occurs for VOx/Al2O3 and VOx/Siral (Fig. 1) due to the appearance of polymerized VO4 entities linked via oxygen bridges."

[5] "The content of SiO2 (0 to 100 wt.%) in the studied Al2O3SiO2 supports was demonstrated to have a strong effect on the activity and particularly the on-stream stability of the supported VOx species in propane DH."

[6] "The highest spacetime yield of propene was only 25% lower than that over industrially relevant PtSn/Al2O3 under the same reaction conditions."

[7] "Acidic properties of the support were found to be crucial for the generation of such catalytically active carbon species."

[1] "In recent years, such supported vanadia catalysts have found wide commercial application as oxidation catalysts: selective oxidation of o-xylene to phthalic anhydride [6,7], ammoxidation of alkyl aromatics [8,9], selective catalytic reduction of NOx with NH3 [ 10] and controlling the oxidation of SO2 to SO3 during SCR [ 10-12]. In addition to these oxidation reactions, supported vanadia catalysts have also been investigated for the oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes to olefins [ 13], oxidation of butane to maleic anhydride [ 14-17], pentane oxidation to maleic anhydride [18] and the selective oxidation of methanol to formaldehyde [19] or methyl formate [20]."

[2] "The oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propylene over V2Os/Nb2Os was not dependent on the concentration of the bridging V-O-V bonds [94]. For hydrocarbon oxidation reactions where the TOF increases with surface vanadia coverage it is not clear if this trend is due to an increase in the surface concentration of bridging V-O-V bonds or other factors (e.g., surface acidity, lateral interactions, number of active sites, etc.). The TOFs for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propylene and butane to butene over V2Os/A1203 were found to increase with surface vanadia coverage, by as much as an order of magnitude, suggesting that other factors may also play a role for alumina supported vanadia catalysts [13,95,96]."

[3] "The characteristics of the bridging V-O-support bond can be altered by varying the specific oxide support or oxide support ligands without changing the structure of the surface vanadia species (with the exception of silica). The bridging V-O-support bond appears to be associated with the critical oxygen required for hydrocarbon oxidation reactions since changing the specific oxide support dramatically affects the TOF: approximately four orders of magnitude for methanol oxidation to formaldehyde [19] and two-orders of magnitude for butane oxidation to maleic anhydride [36]. The general trend appears to be CeOz>ZrO2 TiO2>NbzOs>A12Os>SiO2, which inversely correlates with the Sanderson electronegativity of the oxide support cations [97]."

[4] "Monolayer surface coverage of the vanadia overlayer on different oxide supports was recently determined from Raman spectroscopy measurements and found to be approximately 7-8 VOx per nm2 [5,19]. The same monolayer surface VOx coverage was found for different oxide supports (A1203, TiO2, ZrO2, Nb205 and CeO2) with the exception of silica supported vanadia, which exhibited a maximum surface coverage of only 0.7 VOx per nm2."

[5] "The specific phase of the oxide support as well as the specific preparation method do not appear to influence the molecular structure or reactivity of the surface vanadia species."

[1] "Supported vanadium oxides have been widely used as catalysts for a number of reactions. The molecular structure of the surface vanadium oxide species and the catalytic properties are influenced by the method of preparation, the nature of support, promotors and environmental conditions"

[2] "Vanadia species dispersed on alumina offer a broad range of VOx structures [3] and show a high activity and selectivity for the production of alkenes from the corresponding alkanes"

[3] "Different techniques like XRD, Raman spectroscopy, solid-state NMR, ESR, TPR, FT-IR and UVvis diffuse reflectance spectra (DRS) have been applied to characterize the structure of vanadium species on the surface of alumina"

[4] "Depending on the vanadium loadings, different vanadium oxide species (V5+) were formed on the surface of alumina after calcination. Mainly isolated and polymerized VO4 units were observed at coverages up to a monolayer while VO6 octahedra were predominant on catalyst surfaces at higher vanadium loadings"

[5] "Nature of vanadium species on alumina depends not only on vanadium loadings but also on calcination temperature."

[6] "After calcination of V(4.5 wt.%)/Al2O3 at 873 K dispersed isolated and polymerized V5+ species in tetrahedral coordination dominate, with the later being the main species. With increasing vanadium loadings up to 13.2 wt.% the portion of dispersed VOx species decreased and the portion of vanadium present in a crystalline AlVO4 phase increased."

[7] "The catalytic activity for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane is determined by the amount of dispersed isolated and polymerised tetrahedrally coordinated V5+ species."

[8] "Propene selectivity depends on the dispersion of the tetrahedrally coordinated V5+ species; the higher the dispersion, the higher the propene selectivity."

[9] "Most of the studies mentioned above were carried out with catalytic material calcined up to 823 K. The oxidative dehydrogenation of propane is a strong exothermic reaction and maximum temperatures of about 873 K or higher were observed in the catalytic bed using a more concentrated feed"

"Although vanadia catalysts have not been used commercially there is a significant literature concerning the dehydrogenation reaction over supported vanadia systems."

"The possibility of using oxide systems other than chromia is being explored in an effort to make the alkane-alkene conversion process more selective and stable. Supported VOx catalysts have been extensively studied for the oxidative dehydrogenation of light alkanes [...]. They have also been explored in the dehydrogenation of light alkanes including propane and butane [...] and have shown promise to be both active and selective for the dehydrogenation reactions."

"Studies on alumina supported catalysts with a range of vanadia weight loadings revealed [...] that isolated VOx species dominated at surface densities below 1 V/nm2; polyvanadates coexisted with monovanadates at surface densities between 1.2-4.4 V/nm2; and V2O5 formed at a surface density higher than 4.4 V/nm2."

"UV-Vis DRS. Before reduction the catalysts were in a V5+ oxidation state with typical charge transfer bands at 267 nm for a 1% loading, 290 nm for a 3.5% loading and 357 nm for an 8% loading. This change in position of the charge transfer band is indicative of the increasing polymeric nature of the vanadia [67]."

"At low butane partial pressure, TPO quantification results showed that the amount of coke formed in butane dehydrogenation follows the sequence: polymeric VOx > monomeric VOx > V2O5, Al2O3. However, at 1 bar butane pressure the order is changed slightly with V2O5 > polymeric VOx > monomeric VOx > Al2O3."

[1] "Numerous studies on the improvement of existing catalysts and the development of vanadia-based dehydrogenation catalysts have been reported [610]."

[2] "Alumina-supported vanadia has been extensively studied over the last few years, with the activity and selectivity of vanadia-supported catalysts modified by the structural and physicochemical properties of the dispersed species supported on the surface [1115]."

[3] "It is generally accepted that supported vanadium oxide can exist as isolated monomeric vanadia species, one- or two-dimensional polyvanadate domains, or bulk V2O5 crystallites. At low vanadium coverage on the support, isolated monovanadates are the predominant surface species; these condense into polyvanadates and ultimately into bulk V2O5 crystallites as VOx loading increases."

[4] "The extent of this effect depends on the nature of the support and has been studied in detail using XANES, Raman, and UVvisible spectroscopic studies [16]. Silica-supported vanadia is highly susceptible to structural changes on exposure to water at room temperature. Water has little effect on VOx/Al2O3 and VOx/TiO2 structure at room temperature, but at high temperature its effect on the surface structure becomes significant [17]."

[5] "Earlier studies on 1 and 3.5% V on alumina showed that isolated VOx species are much more effective than polyvanadate species at catalysing carbon deposition during butane dehydrogenation. It also has been observed that polyvanadate species are more effective than isolated vanadia species in dehydrogenation [23]."

[6] "A decrease in BET surface area with higher metal loadings was generally observed and could be related to the blockage of pores by the VOx species."

[1] "Of several catalysts, supported group 5 and 6 metal oxides, typically VOx, (101, 132, 133) NbOx, (134) CrOx, (18, 127) MoOx, and WOx, (135) are particularly interesting."

[2] "The best catalyst used for the oxidative dehydrogenation of alkane (ODH), and typically that of propane, is based on VOx supported on oxide materials, (98, 130, 131, 133) but MoOx supported catalysts are becoming competitive."

[3] "These systems are characterized by the presence of isolated sites or small clusters at a low surface coverage; with bulk oxides being formed only at higher surface coverage (above a monolayer)."

[4] "While leading to very different products, these reactions have common reaction intermediates and have the same rate determining step, i.e. CH bond activation."

[5] "Independently of the catalysts and the reactions, the CH bond activation is often the rate determining step."

[6] "Despite years of research, the yields are still limited, and this reaction needs to operate at low conversions to avoid large amounts of overoxidation products (COx)."

[7] "Overall, silica can be regarded as the optimal support in terms of selectivity. Another important fact is that the optimal temperature window for this process is quite narrow, and around 500 C, lower temperatures favor combustion while unselective gas phase reactions start to be competitive at higher temperatures (>550 C)."

[1] "While supported chromium oxide and supported Pt are typically used as catalysts to perform this reaction in commercial processes [1,2], only few studies have been carried out using vanadium-containing catalysts [36]."

[2] "Notwithstanding the strong influence of the support on the physicochemical nature of VOx species, it appears that one of the key variables in controlling the performance of VOx catalysts is the nature of the oxide carrier."

[3] "Regarding the various candidates VOx supported catalysts for n-butane dehydrogenation, both redox and acidbase properties are studied here. Characterization of these catalysts is carried out using temperature programmed reduction and oxidation (TPR and TPO) and ammonia temperature programmed desorption (NH3-TPD)."

[4] "It can thus, be appreciated that a VOx theoretical partial coverage of the supports is obtained for all the catalysts, except for VOxM/-Al2O3. In the latter case, the amount of VOx exceeds the monolayer capacity of the support and this suggests the presence of V2O5 crystallites or a vanadia over layer on this catalyst sample."

[5] "Taking this into account, the H2 consumption peak in the b profile of Fig. 1, corresponding to VOx/-Al2O3 catalysts, is assigned to VOx chains or bi-dimensional species reduction, while the lower temperature shoulder is postulated as the result of the reduction of mono or divandates species."

[1] "Despite the excellent performance of Pt and CrOx catalysts in paraffin dehydrogenation, a number of issues including catalyst poisoning, the high cost of Pt, and environmental concerns associated with the use of Cr have spurred the search for alternatives."

[2] "Research on vanadium-based dehydrogenation catalysts started in the 1980s, although at that time the focus was on oxidative dehydrogenation using vanadiummagnesium mixed oxides."

[3] "The nature of the vanadium present on the catalyst depends to a large extent on the type of carrier, the support surface area, the metal loading, and the oxidation state of vanadium."

[4] "Far below the theoretical monolayer coverage isolated vanadium species are present, at intermediate surface coverage polymeric species or sheets of vanadium oxide are favored, and above monolayer coverage V2O5 crystallites become dominant."

[1] "From environmental points of view, the authors have focused attention on gallium oxide-based catalysts for developing high performance catalysts not containing chromium for the dehydrogenation of propane."

          [2] "In the present study, the dehydrogenation of propane over a silica-supported vanadium oxide catalyst was investigated."

          [3] "The content of vanadium oxide in the catalyst was 5 wt%. The molar content of vanadium oxide in the catalyst was 1.7 mol%. The surface area of the catalyst was 350 m2/g."

[5] "Supported vanadium oxide (VOx) catalysts for the ODH of light alkanes have been studied extensively. They have also been explored in the DH of light alkanes, including propane and butane, and show promise to be both active and selective for DH reactions."

[6] "For example, depending on the pretreatment methods, V/Al2O3 can catalyze the DH of butanes at 853 K with conversion up to about 50% and selectivity to 90%"

[7] "Meanwhile, deactivation of VOx catalysts by coke species is also observed with time on stream in butane DH reactions. However, due to the limited number of studies on supported VOx for alkane DH, many questions remain unanswered"

[1] "In our previous papers we presented the results of the dehydrogenation of isobutane with carbon dioxide over vanadium magnesium oxides [3, 4]. We discussed the influence of vanadium loading and the preparation method on the catalyst activity and its phase composition."

[2] "This report deals with the dehydrogenation of isobutane to isobutene with carbon dioxide over different vanadium containing catalysts. Effects of the support on the conversion of isobutane and selectivity to isobutene will be discussed in terms of redox and acid-base properties of the catalysts."

[3] "The activity of the supported vanadium oxide catalysts during the dehydrogenation of isobutane in the presence and absence of carbon dioxide decreases in the order Cact >> Al2O3 > SiO2 > ZnO > La2O3 > CeO2 > TiO2  ZrO2."

[4] "The high activity of the first four catalysts is correlated with the their ability to undergo reduction at lower temperatures. Moreover, the highest isobutane conversions were obtained over the VOx/Cact and VOx/Al2O3, characterized by considerable acidity, which is probably related to the sorption of isobutane on the catalyst surface."

[5] "The great demand for olefins as a feedstock for industrial processes is the reason why the dehydrogenation of hydrocarbons is an important commercial process."

[1] "The dehydrogenation of light alkanes to the corresponding alkenes is commercially carried out with supported chromium oxide catalysts (1, 2) and platinum metal catalysts (3, 4). Other, noncommercial alkane dehydrogenation catalysts are based on Mo (510), V (1115), Pd (16), Zn (17, 18), Ni (19), and Ga (20)."

[2] "Supported vanadium oxide catalysts have mainly been studied, however, for the oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes resulting in the formation of alkenes and water (2124)."

[4] "The goal of this work was to study the influence of promotors Mg and Zr on the catalytic performance of supported vanadium oxide."

[5] "Apparently both V4+ and V3+ species were active in the dehydrogenation, and tentatively, we conclude that the activity of V4+ (A) was higher than that of V3+."

[2] "The oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propylene over V2Os/Nb2Os was not dependent on the concentration of the bridging V-O-V bonds [94]. For hydrocarbon oxidation reactions where the TOF increases with surface vanadia coverage it is not clear if this trend is due to an increase in the surface concentration of bridging V-O-V bonds or other factors (e.g., surface acidity, lateral interactions, number of active sites, etc.). The TOFs for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propylene and butane to butene over V2Os/A1203 were found to increase with surface vanadia coverage, by as much as an order of magnitude, suggesting that other factors may also play a role for alumina supported vanadia catalysts [13,95,96]."

[3] "The characteristics of the bridging V-O-support bond can be altered by varying the specific oxide support or oxide support ligands without changing the structure of the surface vanadia species (with the exception of silica). The bridging V-O-support bond appears to be associated with the critical oxygen required for hydrocarbon oxidation reactions since changing the specific oxide support dramatically affects the TOF: approximately four orders of magnitude for methanol oxidation to formaldehyde [19] and two-orders of magnitude for butane oxidation to maleic anhydride [36]. The general trend appears to be CeOz>ZrO2 TiO2>NbzOs>A12Os>SiO2, which inversely correlates with the Sanderson electronegativity of the oxide support cations [97]."

It also has been observed that polyvanadate species are more effective than isolated vanadia species in dehydrogenation [23]."

[6] "A decrease in BET surface area with higher metal loadings was generally observed and could be related to the blockage of pores by the VOx species."

[1] "Of several catalysts, supported group 5 and 6 metal oxides, typically VOx, (101, 132, 133) NbOx, (134) CrOx, (18, 127) MoOx, and WOx, (135) are particularly interesting."

[2] "The best catalyst used for the oxidative dehydrogenation of alkane (ODH), and typically that of propane, is based on VOx supported on oxide materials, (98, 130, 131, 133) but MoOx supported catalysts are becoming competitive."

[3] "These systems are characterized by the presence of isolated sites or small clusters at a low surface coverage; with bulk oxides being formed only at higher surface coverage (above a monolayer)."

[4] "While leading to very different products, these reactions have common reaction intermediates and have the same rate determining step, i.e. CH bond activation."

[5] "Independently of the catalysts and the reactions, the CH bond activation is often the rate determining step."

[6] "Despite years of research, the yields are still limited, and this reaction needs to operate at low conversions to avoid large amounts of overoxidation products (COx)."

[7] "Overall, silica can be regarded as the optimal support in terms of selectivity. Another important fact is that the optimal temperature window for this process is quite narrow, and around 500 C, lower temperatures favor combustion while unselective gas phase reactions start to be competitive at higher temperatures (>550 C)."

[1] "While supported chromium oxide and supported Pt are typically used as catalysts to perform this reaction in commercial processes [1,2], only few studies have been carried out using vanadium-containing catalysts [36]."

[2] "Notwithstanding the strong influence of the support on the physicochemical nature of VOx species, it appears that one of the key variables in controlling the performance of VOx catalysts is the nature of the oxide carrier."

[3] "Regarding the various candidates VOx supported catalysts for n-butane dehydrogenation, both redox and acidbase properties are studied here. Characterization of these catalysts is carried out using temperature programmed reduction and oxidation (TPR and TPO) and ammonia temperature programmed desorption (NH3-TPD)."

[4] "It can thus, be appreciated that a VOx theoretical partial coverage of the supports is obtained for all the catalysts, except for VOxM/-Al2O3. In the latter case, the amount of VOx exceeds the monolayer capacity of the support and this suggests the presence of V2O5 crystallites or a vanadia over layer on this catalyst sample."

[5] "Taking this into account, the H2 consumption peak in the b profile of Fig. 1, corresponding to VOx/-Al2O3 catalysts, is assigned to VOx chains or bi-dimensional species reduction, while the lower temperature shoulder is postulated as the result of the reduction of mono or divandates species."

[1] "Despite the excellent performance of Pt and CrOx catalysts in paraffin dehydrogenation, a number of issues including catalyst poisoning, the high cost of Pt, and environmental concerns associated with the use of Cr have spurred the search for alternatives."

[2] "Research on vanadium-based dehydrogenation catalysts started in the 1980s, although at that time the focus was on oxidative dehydrogenation using vanadiummagnesium mixed oxides."

[3] "The nature of the vanadium present on the catalyst depends to a large extent on the type of carrier, the support surface area, the metal loading, and the oxidation state of vanadium."

[4] "Far below the theoretical monolayer coverage isolated vanadium species are present, at intermediate surface coverage polymeric species or sheets of vanadium oxide are favored, and above monolayer coverage V2O5 crystallites become dominant."

[1] "From environmental points of view, the authors have focused attention on gallium oxide-based catalysts for developing high performance catalysts not containing chromium for the dehydrogenation of propane."

          [2] "In the present study, the dehydrogenation of propane over a silica-supported vanadium oxide catalyst was investigated."

          [3] "The content of vanadium oxide in the catalyst was 5 wt%. The molar content of vanadium oxide in the catalyst was 1.7 mol%. The surface area of the catalyst was 350 m2/g."

[1] "The increasing demand for light olefins and the insufficient capacity of current production by steam and catalytic cracking are the driving forces behind the investigation of alternative ways to manufacture these chemicals"

[2] "Currently, the most feasible processes on a commercial scale are catalytic dehydrogenation (DH) and oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of light alkanes"

[3] "Commercial catalysts for alkane DH processes are supported chromium oxide and platinum metal"

[4] "The possibility of using oxide systems other than chromia is being explored in an effort to make the alkaneolefin conversion process more selective and stable."

[5] "Supported vanadium oxide (VOx) catalysts for the ODH of light alkanes have been studied extensively. They have also been explored in the DH of light alkanes, including propane and butane, and show promise to be both active and selective for DH reactions."

[6] "For example, depending on the pretreatment methods, V/Al2O3 can catalyze the DH of butanes at 853 K with conversion up to about 50% and selectivity to 90%"

[7] "Meanwhile, deactivation of VOx catalysts by coke species is also observed with time on stream in butane DH reactions. However, due to the limited number of studies on supported VOx for alkane DH, many questions remain unanswered"

[1] "In our previous papers we presented the results of the dehydrogenation of isobutane with carbon dioxide over vanadium magnesium oxides [3, 4]. We discussed the influence of vanadium loading and the preparation method on the catalyst activity and its phase composition."

[2] "This report deals with the dehydrogenation of isobutane to isobutene with carbon dioxide over different vanadium containing catalysts. Effects of the support on the conversion of isobutane and selectivity to isobutene will be discussed in terms of redox and acid-base properties of the catalysts."

[3] "The activity of the supported vanadium oxide catalysts during the dehydrogenation of isobutane in the presence and absence of carbon dioxide decreases in the order Cact >> Al2O3 > SiO2 > ZnO > La2O3 > CeO2 > TiO2  ZrO2."

[4] "The high activity of the first four catalysts is correlated with the their ability to undergo reduction at lower temperatures. Moreover, the highest isobutane conversions were obtained over the VOx/Cact and VOx/Al2O3, characterized by considerable acidity, which is probably related to the sorption of isobutane on the catalyst surface."

[5] "The great demand for olefins as a feedstock for industrial processes is the reason why the dehydrogenation of hydrocarbons is an important commercial process."

[6] "All of the catalysts listed in Table 1 were prepared to contain a nominal 20 wt.% of vanadium pentoxide."

[1] "Selective Oxidative Dehydrogenation of Propane Over V-Mg-O Catalysts"
          [2] "(at 500-540 C; change of the propane/O2 ratio from 1:2 to 1:1 results in a decrease in propane conversion (33 to 23%) and an increase in selectivity of propene formation (43 to 53%))."

[1] "The dehydrogenation of light alkanes to the corresponding alkenes is commercially carried out with supported chromium oxide catalysts (1, 2) and platinum metal catalysts (3, 4). Other, noncommercial alkane dehydrogenation catalysts are based on Mo (510), V (1115), Pd (16), Zn (17, 18), Ni (19), and Ga (20)."

[2] "Supported vanadium oxide catalysts have mainly been studied, however, for the oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes resulting in the formation of alkenes and water (2124)."

[3] "In earlier work (11), we showed that supported vanadium oxide catalyst is also active in the dehydrogenation of alkanes in the absence of oxygen, and the main products are then alkenes and hydrogen."

[4] "The goal of this work was to study the influence of promotors Mg and Zr on the catalytic performance of supported vanadium oxide."

[5] "Apparently both V4+ and V3+ species were active in the dehydrogenation, and tentatively, we conclude that the activity of V4+ (A) was higher than that of V3+."
