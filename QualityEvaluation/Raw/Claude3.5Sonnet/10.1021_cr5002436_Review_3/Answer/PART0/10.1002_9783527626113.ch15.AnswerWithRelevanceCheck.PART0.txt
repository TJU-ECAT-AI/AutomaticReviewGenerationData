          "Although vanadia catalysts have not been used commercially there is a significant literature concerning the dehydrogenation reaction over supported vanadia systems."

"The possibility of using oxide systems other than chromia is being explored in an effort to make the alkane-alkene conversion process more selective and stable. Supported VOx catalysts have been extensively studied for the oxidative dehydrogenation of light alkanes [...]. They have also been explored in the dehydrogenation of light alkanes including propane and butane [...] and have shown promise to be both active and selective for the dehydrogenation reactions."

"Studies on alumina supported catalysts with a range of vanadia weight loadings revealed [...] that isolated VOx species dominated at surface densities below 1 V/nm2; polyvanadates coexisted with monovanadates at surface densities between 1.2-4.4 V/nm2; and V2O5 formed at a surface density higher than 4.4 V/nm2."

"UV-Vis DRS. Before reduction the catalysts were in a V5+ oxidation state with typical charge transfer bands at 267 nm for a 1% loading, 290 nm for a 3.5% loading and 357 nm for an 8% loading. This change in position of the charge transfer band is indicative of the increasing polymeric nature of the vanadia [67]."

"At low butane partial pressure, TPO quantification results showed that the amount of coke formed in butane dehydrogenation follows the sequence: polymeric VOx > monomeric VOx > V2O5, Al2O3. However, at 1 bar butane pressure the order is changed slightly with V2O5 > polymeric VOx > monomeric VOx > Al2O3."

          Factors driving the exploration of vanadium oxide-based catalysts as alternatives to Pt and CrOx for paraffin dehydrogenation include:

1. The desire to improve selectivity and stability of the alkane-alkene conversion process.
2. The potential for high activity and selectivity in dehydrogenation reactions.
3. Extensive research on VOx catalysts for oxidative dehydrogenation of light alkanes, which led to interest in non-oxidative dehydrogenation.

Research in this area has evolved since the 1980s by:

1. Shifting from studying mainly oxidative dehydrogenation to exploring non-oxidative dehydrogenation.
2. Increasing focus on understanding the nature and structure of supported VOx species.
3. Conducting more detailed investigations into the relationship between catalyst structure and performance.

Variables such as carrier type, support surface area, and metal loading influence the nature and behavior of vanadium species in these catalysts by:

1. Determining the type of VOx species formed (isolated, polymeric, or crystalline) based on surface density.
2. Affecting the oxidation state and reducibility of vanadium.
3. Influencing the dispersion and accessibility of active sites.
4. Impacting coke formation during reactions, which varies with reaction conditions and VOx species type.

These factors contribute to the overall performance of vanadium oxide catalysts in paraffin dehydrogenation reactions, though commercial application has not yet been realized.

          推动钒氧化物基催化剂作为Pt和CrOx在烷烃脱氢反应中替代品探索的因素包括：

1. 希望提高烷烃-烯烃转化过程的选择性和稳定性。
2. 在脱氢反应中具有高活性和选择性的潜力。
3. 对轻烷烃氧化脱氢的VOx催化剂的广泛研究，引发了对非氧化脱氢的兴趣。

自20世纪80年代以来，该领域的研究已经演变：

1. 从主要研究氧化脱氢转向探索非氧化脱氢。
2. 更加关注理解负载VOx物种的性质和结构。
3. 对催化剂结构和性能关系进行更详细的研究。

载体类型、载体表面积和金属负载量等变量通过以下方式影响这些催化剂中钒物种的性质和行为：

1. 根据表面密度决定形成的VOx物种类型（孤立、多聚或结晶）。
2. 影响钒的氧化态和可还原性。
3. 影响活性位点的分散性和可及性。
4. 影响反应过程中的积碳形成，这随反应条件和VOx物种类型而变化。

这些因素共同影响钒氧化物催化剂在烷烃脱氢反应中的整体性能，尽管尚未实现商业应用。
