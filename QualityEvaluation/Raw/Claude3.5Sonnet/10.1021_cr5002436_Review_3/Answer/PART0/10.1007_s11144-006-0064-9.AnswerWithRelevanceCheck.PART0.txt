          [1] "In our previous papers we presented the results of the dehydrogenation of isobutane with carbon dioxide over vanadium magnesium oxides [3, 4]. We discussed the influence of vanadium loading and the preparation method on the catalyst activity and its phase composition."

[2] "This report deals with the dehydrogenation of isobutane to isobutene with carbon dioxide over different vanadium containing catalysts. Effects of the support on the conversion of isobutane and selectivity to isobutene will be discussed in terms of redox and acid-base properties of the catalysts."

[3] "The activity of the supported vanadium oxide catalysts during the dehydrogenation of isobutane in the presence and absence of carbon dioxide decreases in the order Cact >> Al2O3 > SiO2 > ZnO > La2O3 > CeO2 > TiO2  ZrO2."

[4] "The high activity of the first four catalysts is correlated with the their ability to undergo reduction at lower temperatures. Moreover, the highest isobutane conversions were obtained over the VOx/Cact and VOx/Al2O3, characterized by considerable acidity, which is probably related to the sorption of isobutane on the catalyst surface."

[5] "The great demand for olefins as a feedstock for industrial processes is the reason why the dehydrogenation of hydrocarbons is an important commercial process."

[6] "All of the catalysts listed in Table 1 were prepared to contain a nominal 20 wt.% of vanadium pentoxide."

          While the literature does not provide a comprehensive historical overview of vanadium oxide-based catalysts research since the 1980s or explicitly compare them to Pt and CrOx catalysts, it offers insights into current research on vanadium oxide catalysts for paraffin dehydrogenation:

1. Driving factors: The exploration of vanadium oxide catalysts is driven by the high demand for olefins in industrial processes.

2. Research focus: The study examines vanadium oxide catalysts supported on various carriers for isobutane dehydrogenation, investigating how different supports affect isobutane conversion and isobutene selectivity.

3. Variables influencing catalyst behavior:
   a) Carrier type: Significantly affects catalyst activity, with the order of effectiveness being Cact >> Al2O3 > SiO2 > ZnO > La2O3 > CeO2 > TiO2 ≈ ZrO2.
   b) Metal loading: All catalysts were prepared with 20 wt.% vanadium pentoxide.
   c) Redox properties: The most active catalysts can undergo reduction at lower temperatures.
   d) Acidity: Catalysts with considerable acidity (e.g., VOx/Cact and VOx/Al2O3) showed the highest isobutane conversions.
   e) Preparation method: Previous studies examined its influence on catalyst activity and phase composition.

4. Carbon dioxide influence: The study considers the dehydrogenation process both in the presence and absence of CO2.

While the document doesn't directly address the evolution of research since the 1980s, it demonstrates ongoing efforts to optimize vanadium oxide-based catalysts for paraffin dehydrogenation by exploring various supports and their effects on catalyst performance.

          虽然文献没有提供自1980年代以来钒氧化物基催化剂研究的全面历史概述，也没有明确将其与Pt和CrOx催化剂进行比较，但它提供了关于当前钒氧化物催化剂用于烷烃脱氢的研究见解：

1. 驱动因素：对钒氧化物催化剂的探索是由工业过程中对烯烃的高需求所驱动的。

2. 研究重点：该研究考察了各种载体上的钒氧化物催化剂用于异丁烷脱氢，研究不同载体如何影响异丁烷转化率和异丁烯选择性。

3. 影响催化剂行为的变量：
   a) 载体类型：显著影响催化剂活性，有效性顺序为Cact >> Al2O3 > SiO2 > ZnO > La2O3 > CeO2 > TiO2 ≈ ZrO2。
   b) 金属负载量：所有催化剂都制备为含有20重量%的五氧化二钒。
   c) 氧化还原性质：最活跃的催化剂能在较低温度下发生还原。
   d) 酸性：具有较强酸性的催化剂（如VOx/Cact和VOx/Al2O3）显示出最高的异丁烷转化率。
   e) 制备方法：先前的研究考察了其对催化剂活性和相组成的影响。

4. 二氧化碳的影响：研究考虑了有无CO2存在时的脱氢过程。

虽然文档没有直接讨论自1980年代以来研究的演变，但它显示了通过探索各种载体及其对催化剂性能的影响，持续努力优化钒氧化物基催化剂用于烷烃脱氢。
