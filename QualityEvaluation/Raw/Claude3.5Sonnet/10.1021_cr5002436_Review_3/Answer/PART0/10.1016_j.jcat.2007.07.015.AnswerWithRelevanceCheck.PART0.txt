          [1] "Numerous studies on the improvement of existing catalysts and the development of vanadia-based dehydrogenation catalysts have been reported [610]."

[2] "Alumina-supported vanadia has been extensively studied over the last few years, with the activity and selectivity of vanadia-supported catalysts modified by the structural and physicochemical properties of the dispersed species supported on the surface [1115]."

[3] "It is generally accepted that supported vanadium oxide can exist as isolated monomeric vanadia species, one- or two-dimensional polyvanadate domains, or bulk V2O5 crystallites. At low vanadium coverage on the support, isolated monovanadates are the predominant surface species; these condense into polyvanadates and ultimately into bulk V2O5 crystallites as VOx loading increases."

[4] "The extent of this effect depends on the nature of the support and has been studied in detail using XANES, Raman, and UVvisible spectroscopic studies [16]. Silica-supported vanadia is highly susceptible to structural changes on exposure to water at room temperature. Water has little effect on VOx/Al2O3 and VOx/TiO2 structure at room temperature, but at high temperature its effect on the surface structure becomes significant [17]."

[5] "Earlier studies on 1 and 3.5% V on alumina showed that isolated VOx species are much more effective than polyvanadate species at catalysing carbon deposition during butane dehydrogenation. It also has been observed that polyvanadate species are more effective than isolated vanadia species in dehydrogenation [23]."

[6] "A decrease in BET surface area with higher metal loadings was generally observed and could be related to the blockage of pores by the VOx species."

          The exploration of vanadium oxide-based catalysts as alternatives to Pt and CrOx for paraffin dehydrogenation has been driven by several factors:

1. The need to improve existing catalysts and develop new ones for dehydrogenation reactions.
2. The potential of vanadia-based catalysts to offer improved activity and selectivity compared to traditional catalysts.

Research in this area has evolved significantly since the 1980s, with extensive studies on alumina-supported vanadia catalysts over the last few years. The focus has been on understanding and modifying the structural and physicochemical properties of dispersed vanadia species on the support surface to enhance catalytic performance.

Variables such as carrier type, support surface area, and metal loading influence the nature and behavior of vanadium species in these catalysts in the following ways:

1. Carrier type: Different supports (e.g., alumina, silica, titania) affect the structure and properties of the supported vanadia species. For example, silica-supported vanadia is more susceptible to structural changes when exposed to water compared to alumina or titania-supported vanadia.

2. Support surface area: This factor affects the dispersion of vanadium species on the surface. Higher metal loadings generally lead to a decrease in BET surface area, likely due to pore blockage by VOx species.

3. Metal loading: The concentration of vanadium on the support influences the type of vanadium species formed. At low loadings, isolated monomeric vanadia species dominate, while at higher loadings, these condense into polyvanadates and eventually form bulk V2O5 crystallites.

These variables play a crucial role in determining the structural and physicochemical properties of the dispersed vanadium species on the support surface, which in turn affect the activity and selectivity of the catalysts. Researchers have extensively studied these factors using various spectroscopic techniques such as XANES, Raman, and UV-visible spectroscopy to better understand the structure-activity relationships in vanadia-based catalysts.

The type of vanadium species present affects catalyst performance. Isolated VOx species are more effective at catalyzing carbon deposition, while polyvanadate species are more effective for dehydrogenation. This suggests that optimizing the distribution of vanadium species is crucial for developing effective dehydrogenation catalysts.

          钒氧化物基催化剂作为烷烃脱氢反应中铂和氧化铬催化剂的替代品的探索受到以下因素的推动：

1. 改进现有催化剂并开发新型脱氢催化剂的需求。
2. 钒基催化剂有潜力提供比传统催化剂更高的活性和选择性。

自20世纪80年代以来，该领域的研究已显著发展，近年来对氧化铝负载的钒催化剂进行了广泛研究。研究重点是理解和修改分散在支撑表面上的钒物种的结构和物理化学性质，以提高催化性能。

载体类型、支撑表面积和金属负载量等变量以下列方式影响这些催化剂中钒物种的性质和行为：

1. 载体类型：不同的载体（如氧化铝、二氧化硅、二氧化钛）会影响负载的钒物种的结构和性质。例如，与氧化铝或二氧化钛负载的钒相比，二氧化硅负载的钒在暴露于水中时更容易发生结构变化。

2. 载体表面积：这个因素影响钒物种在表面的分散程度。较高的金属负载量通常导致BET比表面积减小，可能是由于VOx物种堵塞孔隙所致。

3. 金属负载量：载体上钒的浓度影响形成的钒物种类型。在低负载量时，以孤立的单体钒物种为主，而在高负载量时，这些物种会凝聚成多钒酸盐，最终形成体相的V2O5晶体。

这些变量在决定载体表面上分散的钒物种的结构和物理化学性质方面起着至关重要的作用，进而影响催化剂的活性和选择性。研究人员已经使用各种光谱技术，如XANES、拉曼和紫外-可见光谱，对这些因素进行了广泛研究，以更好地理解钒基催化剂中的结构-活性关系。

存在的钒物种类型影响催化剂性能。孤立的VOx物种更有效地催化碳沉积，而多钒氧化物物种在脱氢反应中更有效。这表明优化钒物种分布对开发有效的脱氢催化剂至关重要。
