          [1] "Selective Oxidative Dehydrogenation of Propane Over V-Mg-O Catalysts"
          [2] "(at 500-540 C; change of the propane/O2 ratio from 1:2 to 1:1 results in a decrease in propane conversion (33 to 23%) and an increase in selectivity of propene formation (43 to 53%))."

          The provided literature offers limited information to fully answer the question about the factors driving exploration of vanadium oxide-based catalysts as alternatives to Pt and CrOx for paraffin dehydrogenation, how research has evolved since the 1980s, or how variables like carrier type, support surface area, and metal loading influence vanadium species behavior.

          However, the study does explore V-Mg-O catalysts for selective oxidative dehydrogenation of propane, indicating that vanadium oxide-based catalysts were being investigated as alternatives for paraffin dehydrogenation in the 1980s. The research examines how changing the propane/O2 ratio affects conversion and selectivity. Specifically, changing the ratio from 1:2 to 1:1 decreased propane conversion from 33% to 23% but increased propene formation selectivity from 43% to 53%. The reaction conditions involved temperatures of 500-540°C.

          This information suggests that reaction conditions, particularly the ratio of reactants and temperature, can significantly influence the performance of vanadium-based catalysts in paraffin dehydrogenation reactions. However, the document does not provide specific details about carrier type, support surface area, or metal loading effects on vanadium species in these catalysts.

          提供的文献包含有限的信息，无法全面回答关于推动钒氧化物基催化剂作为Pt和CrOx的替代品用于烷烃脱氢的因素，自1980年代以来研究如何演变，或者载体类型、支撑表面积和金属负载等变量如何影响钒物种行为的问题。

          然而，该研究确实探讨了V-Mg-O催化剂在丙烷选择性氧化脱氢中的应用，表明在20世纪80年代，研究人员正在研究钒氧化物基催化剂作为烷烃脱氢的替代品。研究考察了改变丙烷/O2比例如何影响转化率和选择性。具体来说，将比例从1:2改变为1:1会使丙烷转化率从33%降低到23%，但丙烯生成的选择性从43%提高到53%。反应条件涉及500-540°C的温度范围。

          这些信息表明，反应条件，特别是反应物的比例和温度，可以显著影响钒基催化剂在烷烃脱氢反应中的性能。然而，该文献并未提供关于载体类型、支持物表面积或金属负载对这些催化剂中钒物种影响的具体细节。
