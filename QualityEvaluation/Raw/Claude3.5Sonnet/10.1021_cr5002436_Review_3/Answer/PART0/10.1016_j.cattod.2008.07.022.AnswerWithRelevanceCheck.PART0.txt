          [1] "The catalytic dehydrogenation and oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of light alkanes is an important route to the formation of alkenes and alkadienes, important precursors for fuels, plastics and many other materials. In particular, a substantial body of research has focused on supported VOx catalysts for ODH reactions [16]."

[2] "Recently, studies have investigated the direct dehydrogenation of light alkanes over supported VOx catalysts in the absence of gas-phase oxygen where a different reaction mechanism must operate [711]."

[3] "As vanadium loading increases, so does the domain size of the supported vanadate units with significant quantities of V2O5 observed at the highest loadings."

[4] "As the vanadia loading increases, polyvanadate and crystalline V2O5 become the dominant vanadia species representing 60% and 10%, respectively of vanadium on the surface of 3.5 V. At higher loadings the fraction of V2O5 increases, reaching 30% on 8 V consistent with 51V MAS NMR results reported herein."

[5] "From these data it is possible to determine structureactivity relationships, with polymeric vanadia clusters favouring the formation of butenes and butadienes, while more isolated species are highly active towards the formation of polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbons retained on the catalyst surface post-reaction."

[6] "As expected, the measured surface area decreases with increasing vanadium loading, from 104 m2 g1 for 1 V to 77 m2 g1 for 8 V."

[7] "Calcination temperature is known to strongly influence catalyst structure and therefore catalytic performance [21,22]."

          The exploration of vanadium oxide-based catalysts for paraffin dehydrogenation has been driven by the need for alternatives to Pt and CrOx catalysts. Research in this area has evolved since the 1980s from focusing on oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) reactions to investigating direct dehydrogenation of light alkanes in the absence of gas-phase oxygen.

Several variables influence the nature and behavior of vanadium species in these catalysts:

1. Metal loading: As vanadium loading increases, the domain size of supported vanadate units grows. At low loadings, monomeric vanadate species predominate. Higher loadings lead to the formation of polyvanadate and crystalline V2O5 species. For example, at 3.5 wt% loading, polyvanadate and crystalline V2O5 represent 60% and 10% of surface vanadium species respectively, while at 8 wt% loading, the fraction of V2O5 increases to 30%.

2. Support surface area: The support's surface area affects the dispersion and distribution of vanadium species. The measured surface area decreases with increasing vanadium loading, from 104 m2/g for 1 wt% V to 77 m2/g for 8 wt% V.

3. Carrier type: While not explicitly discussed in the given text, the type of carrier (support material) can significantly influence the behavior of vanadium species. Alumina (Al2O3) is mentioned as a support material in some of the studies.

4. Calcination temperature: This strongly influences catalyst structure and, consequently, catalytic performance.

The type of vanadium species present affects catalyst performance. Polymeric vanadia clusters favor the formation of desired products (butenes and butadienes), while more isolated species promote the formation of undesired polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbons that remain on the catalyst surface after reaction.

These factors collectively determine the distribution of vanadium species (monomeric, polymeric, or crystalline) on the catalyst surface, which in turn affects the catalyst's activity, selectivity, and stability in paraffin dehydrogenation reactions.

          钒氧化物基催化剂在烷烃脱氢领域的探索主要是为了寻找铂和铬氧化物催化剂的替代品。自20世纪80年代以来，该领域的研究已经从关注氧化脱氢(ODH)反应演变为研究在无气相氧条件下的直接脱氢轻烷烃。

几个变量影响这些催化剂中钒物种的性质和行为：

1. 金属负载量：随着钒负载量的增加，支持的钒酸盐单元的域大小增加。在低负载量时，单体钒酸盐物种占主导地位。更高的负载量会导致多聚钒酸盐和结晶V2O5物种的形成。例如，在3.5重量百分比的负载量下，多聚钒酸盐和结晶V2O5分别占表面钒物种的60%和10%，而在8重量百分比的负载量下，V2O5的比例增加到30%。

2. 载体表面积：载体的表面积影响钒物种的分散和分布。测得的表面积随钒负载量的增加而减少，从1重量百分比V时的104 m2/g降至8重量百分比V时的77 m2/g。

3. 载体类型：虽然在给定的文本中没有明确讨论，但载体（支持材料）的类型可以显著影响钒物种的行为。一些研究中提到了氧化铝（Al2O3）作为载体材料。

4. 焙烧温度：这强烈影响催化剂结构，进而影响催化性能。

存在的钒物种类型影响催化剂性能。聚合的钒氧化物簇有利于形成所需产物（丁烯和丁二烯），而更孤立的物种促进形成不需要的多环芳烃，这些芳烃在反应后留在催化剂表面。

这些因素共同决定了催化剂表面钒物种（单体、聚合物或晶态）的分布，进而影响催化剂在烷烃脱氢反应中的活性、选择性和稳定性。
