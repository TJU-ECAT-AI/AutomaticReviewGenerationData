          [1] "The dehydrogenation of light alkanes to the corresponding alkenes is commercially carried out with supported chromium oxide catalysts (1, 2) and platinum metal catalysts (3, 4). Other, noncommercial alkane dehydrogenation catalysts are based on Mo (510), V (1115), Pd (16), Zn (17, 18), Ni (19), and Ga (20)."

[2] "Supported vanadium oxide catalysts have mainly been studied, however, for the oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes resulting in the formation of alkenes and water (2124)."

[3] "In earlier work (11), we showed that supported vanadium oxide catalyst is also active in the dehydrogenation of alkanes in the absence of oxygen, and the main products are then alkenes and hydrogen."

[4] "The goal of this work was to study the influence of promotors Mg and Zr on the catalytic performance of supported vanadium oxide."

[5] "Apparently both V4+ and V3+ species were active in the dehydrogenation, and tentatively, we conclude that the activity of V4+ (A) was higher than that of V3+."

          The exploration of vanadium oxide-based catalysts as alternatives to Pt and CrOx for paraffin dehydrogenation has been driven by several factors:

1. The search for non-commercial alternatives to chromium oxide and platinum catalysts, which are currently used commercially.
2. The potential for vanadium oxide catalysts to perform dehydrogenation in the absence of oxygen, producing alkenes and hydrogen as main products.
3. The ability to modify and improve vanadium oxide catalysts through the use of promoters like Mg and Zr.

Research in this area has evolved since the 1980s by:
1. Expanding from oxidative dehydrogenation studies to non-oxidative dehydrogenation.
2. Investigating the influence of promoters like Mg and Zr on catalytic performance.
3. Studying the active species and oxidation states of vanadium in the catalysts.

Variables influencing the nature and behavior of vanadium species in these catalysts include:
1. The type of support used (e.g., alumina in this study).
2. The addition of promoters like Mg and Zr.
3. The presence of V4+ and V3+ species, with V4+ potentially showing higher activity.

However, the literature does not provide specific information on how carrier type, support surface area, and metal loading influence the vanadium species. More research would be needed to fully address these aspects.

          钒氧化物基催化剂作为烷烃脱氢反应中铂和铬氧化物催化剂的替代品被探索，主要由以下因素驱动：

1. 寻找非商业化的替代品来取代目前商业使用的氧化铬和铂催化剂。
2. 钒氧化物催化剂在无氧条件下进行脱氢反应的潜力，主要产物为烯烃和氢气。
3. 通过使用如镁和锆等助剂来修饰和改进钒氧化物催化剂的可能性。

自20世纪80年代以来，该领域的研究已经发展：
1. 从氧化脱氢研究扩展到非氧化脱氢研究。
2. 研究镁和锆等助剂对催化性能的影响。
3. 研究催化剂中钒的活性物种和氧化态。

影响这些催化剂中钒物种性质和行为的变量包括：
1. 所使用的载体类型（例如，本研究中的氧化铝）。
2. 添加镁和锆等助剂。
3. V4+和V3+物种的存在，其中V4+可能表现出更高的活性。

然而，文献中并未提供载体类型、载体表面积和金属负载量如何影响钒物种的具体信息。需要进行更多研究才能全面解答这些方面的问题。
