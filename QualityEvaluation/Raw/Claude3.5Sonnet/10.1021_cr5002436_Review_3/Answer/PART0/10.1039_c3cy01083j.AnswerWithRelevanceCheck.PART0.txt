          [1] "Recently, we have demonstrated that the VOx/MCM-41 catalyst with highly dispersed, near to isolated VOx species showed similar selectivity and, most importantly, stable catalytic performance in several DH/regeneration cycles surpassing in quality the industrially relevant CrOx/MCM-41 and PtSn/Al2O3."

[2] "The aim of the current work was to further explore the potential of VOx-based catalysts for the DH reaction. To this end, we selected commercial Al2O3SiO2 materials (Siral), pure Al2O3 and SiO2 as supports to prepare catalysts free of crystalline V2O5 particles."

[3] "Al2O3, SiO2(MCM-41), and Al2O3SiO2 (Siral) with a SiO2 content varying from 1 to 70 wt.% were used to prepare supported catalysts with a V loading below one monolayer."

[4] "As the surface density of V increases, the red shift of the CT onset occurs for VOx/Al2O3 and VOx/Siral (Fig. 1) due to the appearance of polymerized VO4 entities linked via oxygen bridges."

[5] "The content of SiO2 (0 to 100 wt.%) in the studied Al2O3SiO2 supports was demonstrated to have a strong effect on the activity and particularly the on-stream stability of the supported VOx species in propane DH."

[6] "The highest spacetime yield of propene was only 25% lower than that over industrially relevant PtSn/Al2O3 under the same reaction conditions."

[7] "Acidic properties of the support were found to be crucial for the generation of such catalytically active carbon species."

          Factors driving the exploration of vanadium oxide-based catalysts as alternatives to Pt and CrOx for paraffin dehydrogenation include:

1. Stable catalytic performance across multiple dehydrogenation/regeneration cycles, surpassing industrial CrOx/MCM-41 and PtSn/Al2O3 catalysts.
2. High selectivity and yields comparable to industrial catalysts (only 25% lower than PtSn/Al2O3).
3. Potential for cost-effectiveness compared to precious metal catalysts.

Research in this area has evolved since the 1980s to focus on:

1. Optimizing support materials, exploring Al2O3, SiO2, and mixed Al2O3-SiO2 supports with varying silica content.
2. Controlling vanadium loading to achieve highly dispersed species below monolayer coverage.
3. Understanding the role of support acidity in carbon formation and catalyst behavior.
4. Investigating the nature and catalytic activity of carbon deposits formed during reaction.

Key variables influencing the nature and behavior of vanadium species in these catalysts include:

1. Carrier type and composition (Al2O3, SiO2, Al2O3-SiO2 ratio)
2. Support surface area 
3. Vanadium loading (kept below monolayer coverage)
4. Support acidity
5. SiO2 content in Al2O3-SiO2 supports (0 to 100 wt%)
6. Surface density of vanadium - affecting the degree of polymerization

These factors collectively influence the dispersion, polymerization state, stability, and catalytic performance of the supported vanadium oxide species in paraffin dehydrogenation reactions.

          推动钒氧化物基催化剂作为Pt和CrOx在烷烃脱氢反应中替代品探索的因素包括：

1. 在多个脱氢/再生循环中表现出稳定的催化性能，超过工业用CrOx/MCM-41和PtSn/Al2O3催化剂。
2. 高选择性和产率可与工业催化剂相媲美（仅比PtSn/Al2O3低25%）。
3. 与贵金属催化剂相比具有潜在的成本效益。

自1980年代以来，该领域的研究已经发展到关注：

1. 优化载体材料，探索Al2O3、SiO2和不同二氧化硅含量的混合Al2O3-SiO2载体。
2. 控制钒负载量以实现单层覆盖以下的高分散物种。
3. 理解载体酸性在碳沉积和催化剂行为中的作用。
4. 研究反应过程中形成的碳沉积物的性质和催化活性。

影响这些催化剂中钒物种性质和行为的关键变量包括：

1. 载体类型和组成（Al2O3、SiO2、Al2O3-SiO2比例）
2. 载体表面积
3. 钒负载量（保持在单层覆盖以下）
4. 载体酸性
5. Al2O3-SiO2载体中的SiO2含量（0至100 wt%）
6. 钒的表面密度 - 影响聚合度

这些因素共同影响了负载钒氧化物物种在烷烃脱氢反应中的分散性、聚合状态、稳定性和催化性能。
