          "As expected, Cr2O3 and V2O5 exhibited high activities. These catalysts are known to be active catalysts for dehydrogenation of alkanes."
          "The effect of CO2 on the yield of ethane with V2O5 in the presence of CO2 was slightly detrimental."

          The provided literature offers limited information relevant to the question. It confirms that V2O5 exhibits high activity for alkane dehydrogenation, comparable to Cr2O3. However, the presence of CO2 slightly decreased V2O5's effectiveness for ethane dehydrogenation. The document does not provide comprehensive information about the evolution of research on vanadium oxide-based catalysts since the 1980s, factors driving their exploration as alternatives to Pt and CrOx, or how variables such as carrier type, support surface area, and metal loading influence the nature and behavior of vanadium species in these catalysts.

          提供的文献仅提供了有限的相关信息。它确认V2O5对烷烃脱氢表现出高活性，与Cr2O3相当。然而，CO2的存在略微降低了V2O5对乙烷脱氢的有效性。文档没有提供关于20世纪80年代以来钒氧化物基催化剂研究演变的全面信息，也没有说明推动将其作为Pt和CrOx替代品探索的因素，或者载体类型、支撑表面积和金属负载等变量如何影响这些催化剂中钒物种的性质和行为。
