The research examines how changing the propane/O2 ratio affects conversion and selectivity. Specifically, changing the ratio from 1:2 to 1:1 decreased propane conversion from 33% to 23% but increased propene formation selectivity from 43% to 53%. The reaction conditions involved temperatures of 500-540°C.\n\n          This information suggests that reaction conditions, particularly the ratio of reactants and temperature, can significantly influence the performance of vanadium-based catalysts in paraffin dehydrogenation reactions.
