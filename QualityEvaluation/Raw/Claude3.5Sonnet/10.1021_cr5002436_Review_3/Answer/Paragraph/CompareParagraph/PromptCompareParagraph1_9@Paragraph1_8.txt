4.3 Vanadium Oxide-Based Catalysts
Despite the excellent performance of Pt and CrOx catalysts in paraffin dehydrogenation, a number of issues including catalyst poisoning, the high cost of Pt, and environmental concerns associated with the use of Cr have spurred the search for alternatives. Vanadium oxides are known to be active for many hydrocarbon oxidation reactions, including dehydrogenation. Research on vanadium-based dehydrogenation catalysts started in the 1980s, although at that time the focus was on oxidative dehydrogenation using vanadium&ndash;magnesium mixed oxides. (199, 200)
The nature of the vanadium present on the catalyst depends to a large extent on the type of carrier, the support surface area, the metal loading, and the oxidation state of vanadium. (201) Far below the theoretical monolayer coverage isolated vanadium species are present, at intermediate surface coverage polymeric species or sheets of vanadium oxide are favored, and above monolayer coverage V2O5 crystallites become dominant. Therefore, a combination of V&ndash;O-support, V&ndash;O&ndash;V, or V═O moieties may be obtained, each having different catalytic activity. In addition, depending on the support, mixed oxides with Al, Zr, Ti, or Mg may be formed.
The surface area-to-metal loading ratio determines which species will form. Indeed, Wu et al. reported that monomeric species are predominantly present below 1.2 V/nm2, polymeric vanadium species prevail between 1.2 and 4.4 V/nm2, and crystalline V2O5 species preponderate at even higher loadings. On the one hand, the presence of hydroxyl groups on the surface of the support is important to obtain a well-dispersed catalyst, as −OH groups serve as anchoring sites for the vanadium precursors used to prepare these catalysts. On the other hand, acid sites are detrimental for catalyst performance, because they facilitate cracking and induce coke formation. A schematic display of these vanadium species is shown in Figure 21. (202)
Several authors claim that two-dimensional polymeric V3+ or V4+ species are the most active for dehydrogenation, (203-206) the vanadium species bonded directly with the γ/θ-alumina support being the most active sites in PDH. Isolated vanadium species are also active, albeit they are susceptible to deactivation due to coke formation. On the contrary, large V2O5 crystallites are practically inactive in dehydrogenation. (30, 206)
Prior to reaction, the vanadium in these catalysts is generally present as V5+. However, the reduction of the catalyst by the hydrocarbon feed results in the formation of V4+ and V3+. (207-209) The reducibility of the vanadium species depends on their molecular structure, V&ndash;O&ndash;V and V═O bonds being more easily reduced than V&ndash;O-support bonds. Harlin et al. studied the effects of vanadium oxide reduction with H2, CO, and CH4 prior to the dehydrogenation reaction. In all cases, the reduction was incomplete, and yielded a mix of vanadium oxide species, including V3+, V4+, and V5+ (see Figure 22). Higher initial catalytic activities were obtained in all cases, although the effect was strongest after reduction with CO. The authors suggested that when the catalyst was reduced with H2 and CH4, detrimental −OH groups were formed. V4+ was determined to be the most active species in butane dehydrogenation.
Initially, deactivation is caused by the strong adsorption of reactants on the active sites and to a lesser extent to coke deposition. When the coke is removed through the calcination of the catalyst, the latter may deactivate further as vanadium oxide species sinter and form larger V2O5 crystallites or mixed oxides such as AlVO4, both of which are less active. (206) V2O5 crystallites can revert to active polymeric vanadium species by treating the catalyst under an oxygen atmosphere at 600 °C. (210)
In several studies, CO2 is added to the feed as a mild oxidant to increase alkene yields. (211-213) Different reasons for this beneficial effect of CO2 have been suggested, such as the removal of acid sites that catalyze unwanted side reactions, coke gasification, oxidation of overly reduced vanadium centers, and hydrogen removal by the reverse water&ndash;gas shift reaction. Ogonowski et al. reported that the effect of CO2 depends strongly on the catalyst support. Relatively weak basic sites on carriers, such as those present on an activated carbon support, facilitate the reverse water gas shift reaction, which lifts the thermodynamic limitation of the reaction and increases alkane conversion. When these basic sites are too strong, as is the case on Al2O3 and ZnO2, CO2 irreversibly adsorbs and poisons these sites. This increases the acidity of the support, which in turn increases coke formation and lowers selectivity. If these basic sites are absent, as in the case of SiO2, no beneficial effects of CO2 are observed.
Alumina is commonly used as a support for vanadium oxide catalysts, although Sokolov et al. concluded through testing a wide range of Si- and Al-based supports that using silica to dope the alumina support provides beneficial effects on catalyst stability and activity. (214) Furthermore, as was shown by Harlin et al., the performance of supported vanadium catalysts can be improved through the addition of MgO, either as a promoter or as a component of a mixed oxide. According to these workers, the increase in dehydrogenation selectivity stems from the basic nature of MgO, resulting in reduced coke formation. (208)

4.4 Molybdenum Oxide-Based Catalysts
Molybdenum oxides are also frequently used as catalysts in hydrocarbon conversion reactions, including dehydrogenation. To our knowledge, the first report of the dehydrogenation activity of a molybdenum oxide-based catalyst was of MoO3/Al2O3 in the dehydrocyclization of n-heptane, which was published in 1946. (216) Since that first report, the nonoxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes on MoOx has been studied scarcely, as emphasis has been given to the study of oxidative dehydrogenation on these materials.
The chemistry of molybdenum oxide is comparable to that of vanadium oxide, as Mo can be present as MoOx monomers, polymers, or MoO3 crystallites, depending on the molybdenum loading, the type of support used, and catalyst preparation conditions. (217)
Harlin et al. noted that optimal activity was achieved with monolayer coverage of molybdenum oxide on an alumina support. In the fresh catalyst, molybdenum is present as Mo6+, but analogously to catalysts comprising vanadium and chromium oxide, MoO3 is reduced by the hydrocarbon feed during reaction to create the active species. (218) These reduced sites are believed to be Mo4+ and Mo5+. Further reduction results in sites that are more active, but the latter catalyze cracking and deactivate fast due to coke deposition. In fact, at loadings above monolayer coverage, the catalyst is more easily reduced, which results in a drop in catalyst activity. (218, 219) The same authors also point out that such a catalyst deactivates due to the formation of catalytically inactive Al2(MoO4)3 crystallites. To prevent the formation of this mixed oxide, they added magnesium oxide to obtain a molybdenum&ndash;magnesium mixed oxide that also shows dehydrogenation activity. It was found that an additional beneficial effect of magnesia addition is that the resulting mixed oxide has lower acidity, which increases alkene selectivity and reduces coke deposition. The reduction of the catalyst with hydrogen prior to reaction increases conversion, although selectivity decreases due to the formation of acid sites. (220) Overall, MoO3 catalysts deactivate rapidly due to coking and generally afford a relatively low conversion and selectivity.
The formation of molybdenum oxycarbides (MoOxCy) has been reported to occur during butane dehydrogenation on unsupported molybdenum oxide. These materials are also active in the dehydrogenation of paraffins, and a high activity close to the thermodynamic equilibrium is initially obtained, although over a period of a few hours the selectivity drops to zero and the reaction yields only methane, as shown in Figure 23. During this period, the oxycarbide becomes depleted from oxygen and a wide range of carbides active in hydrogenolysis are formed. (222) To improve the stability of the oxide, steam can be added to the feed (which hampers the growth of these carbides) or the catalyst can be doped with vanadium (which increases the oxophilicity of the catalyst). X-ray diffractograms showing this transition are shown in Figure 24. However, the introduction of steam is not free of drawbacks, as it induces sintering. Hydrogen addition prevents coke formation and increases conversion, albeit it is believed that H2 competitively adsorbs on the active sites of the catalyst. (221-223)
Consistent with the fact that MoOxCy is a catalyst active in butane dehydrogenation, Harlin et al. showed that MoO3 deposited on SiC displays significant catalytic properties when hydrogen and steam are present in the feed. (224) As compared to bulk MoO3 and MoO3 supported on SiO2 and Al2O3, higher selectivities and stability are obtained over MoO3/SiC, albeit at the cost of a lower conversion. This was explained by the increased reducibility of MoO3/SiC as compared to the MoO3/Al2O3 catalyst. A summary of the Mo-based catalysts used for the dehydrogenation of light paraffins is shown in Table 6.

4.5 Gallium Oxide-Based Catalysts
The dehydrogenation activity of gallium oxide supported on ZSM-5, which was first reported in the late 1980s in studies dealing with conversion of propane to aromatics, has been the target of renewed attention in recent years. (225-228) In the interim, both bulk and supported Ga2O3 have been used as dehydrogenation catalysts.
The exact nature of the active sites in Ga-based dehydrogenation catalysts is still under debate. Akin to Al2O3, Ga2O3 has different polymorphs of which β-Ga2O3 is not only the most stable, but also the most active Ga species in PDH according to some authors. (229) β-Ga2O3 has a monoclinic structure, in which gallium atoms are equally distributed between tetrahedral and octahedral configurations. This crystal structure has a high concentration of weak Lewis acid sites (coordinatively unsaturated tetrahedral ones on the surface of the material), which are deemed to be centers of dehydrogenation activity. (230) Indeed, a heterolytic dissociation reaction mechanism has been proposed where H&ndash; adsorbs on a Ga+ Lewis acid site and C3H7+ on a neighboring oxygen, although these species can also be adsorbed reversed. (33, 231) The assignment of Lewis acid sites as the active species was substantiated by Chen et al., (232) who, by relating the results of NH3-TPD measurements with activity data for different GaxAl10&ndash;xO15 mixed oxides, showed that a high concentration of Lewis acid groups in the form of coordinatively unsaturated tetrahedral Ga3+ cations is a prerequisite for dehydrogenation activity (see Figure 25). Xu et al. reported dehydrogenation activity on both Lewis and Brønsted acid sites on GaO3/H-ZSM-5. A zeolitic support displaying a low concentration of medium and strong acid sites and a relatively high concentration of weak acid sites was found to lead to the most active and stable catalyst. (233, 234) In addition, Michorczyk et al. concluded that acidic groups catalyze the reaction after observing that promotion with a base, such as potassium, resulted in a decrease in activity. (235)
Several authors have performed DFT calculations in an effort to understand the dehydrogenation reaction mechanism on Ga2O3. Studies by Liu et al. regarding propane dehydrogenation on a perfect Ga2O3 (100) surface revealed that the C&ndash;H bond is activated by a surface oxygen that abstracts an hydrogen from the propane molecule, thus forming a propyl species, which coordinates with a Ga surface site and a hydroxyl group. A second hydroxyl group is formed via β-hydrogen elimination, but for these hydroxyl groups to recombine, either as H2O or as H2, a high energy barrier needs to be overcome. This barrier is much lower over a gallium hydride&ndash;hydroxide species, although the formation of the gallium hydride also involves a high energy barrier. Nevertheless, theoretical calculations by Pidko et al. indicate that these relatively stable [H&ndash;Ga&ndash;OH]+ sites are preferentially regenerated by water desorption resulting in a reduced active site. (236) Murata and co-workers have observed an increase in activity after a prereduction step with hydrogen at 550 °C, while a simultaneous increase of Gaδ+H and Ga&ndash;OH sites was observed via NH3 TPD. These authors proposed that these sites also form during reaction and may be responsible for the dehydrogenation activity of the silica supported Ga2O3 catalyst. (237, 238)
Contradictory information has been reported regarding the reducibility of Ga2O3. Rodriguez et al. reported that Ga2O3/Al2O3 is not reduced by hydrogen at 700 °C, but the presence of Pd on the catalyst can assist the reduction of Ga3+ to Ga+ and Ga0 at temperatures between 300 and 550 °C and form an alloy (in which Ga0 is immobilized). Indeed, it has been reported that the reduction of Ga2O3 can be promoted by the proximity of other, more easily reduced metals, such as Pt and Pd. (131-133, 238) For instance, on a Pt&ndash;Ga/H-beta catalyst, reduced gallium hydrides were observed after hydrogen reduction at 550 °C. (239) It has also been proposed that the reducibility of these species depends on the interaction of gallium oxide with the catalyst support, which is also the case with CrOx (vide supra), where a weak metal&ndash;support interaction results in an increased reducibility. Indeed, Meitzner et al. showed that Ga2O3/H-ZSM-5 could be reduced by hydrogen or hydrocarbons at dehydrogenation reaction conditions. Finally, regarding the reduction of Ga2O3, it is important to note that Ga2O is gaseous and metallic gallium is liquid at dehydrogenation reaction conditions. (240)
A number of studies have shown that the addition of CO2 to the reactant feed improves the olefin yield. (241-245) Nakagawa et al. found that the addition of steam and CO2 decreased coke deposition on a Ga2O3/TiO2 catalyst by the Boudouart reaction, while also assisting ethylene desorption. (241, 242) However, other authors claimed that the increase in activity was caused by the reverse water&ndash;gas shift reaction (RWGS). (243, 244) Additionally, Michorczyk et al. noted that this effect could only be seen at relative low levels of coke deposition. (235) It was suggested that CO2 could also poison the basic sites required for the dissociative adsorption of the alkane. Additionally, Hensen et al. studied the promoting effect of water with experiments and theory and observed an increase in the conversion of propane by cofeeding water. (246) The authors attributed this promoting effect to the formation of partially hydrolyzed gallium species, more specifically, to the formation of binuclear hydroxyl-bridged Ga3+ cations.
Different carriers have been used in gallium oxide-based dehydrogenation catalysts, the inclusion of acid and basic sites on the support being important to achieve a high conversion. Xu et al. reported that in the absence of an oxidizing agent, the conversion obtained using Ga2O3 supported on ZrO2, Al2O3, and TiO2 was high, medium, and low, respectively, while SiO2 and MgO-supported Ga2O3 were inactive in alkane dehydrogenation. (233) The authors proposed the activity to be dependent on the presence of acid sites of medium strength on the catalyst surface. However, a different trend was observed when CO2 was present, as conversion was observed to be high on Ga2O3/TiO2 and low on Ga2O3/ZrO2 and Ga2O3/Al2O3. This was attributed to the two contrary roles of CO2, which on the one hand removes H2 from the surface of the catalyst by the reverse water&ndash;gas shift reaction, while on the other hand absorbs strongly on the basic sites of the support. Thus, the low conversion observed when zirconia or alumina were employed as the support can be ascribed to the relatively high amount of basic sites on these oxides. Notably, the structure of the support is also important, as a mesoporous Ga&ndash;Al mixed oxide exhibited an increased resistance to catalyst coking. (245)
Work on the promotion of GaOx-based dehydrogenation catalysts appears to be limited, although a patent by Iezzi et al. claims that a catalyst comprising 1.2 wt % Ga2O3, <99 ppm of Pt, and 1.6 wt % of SiO2 on an Al2O3 support represents a highly active formulation in the dehydrogenation reaction. (247) Indeed, when this catalyst is used for PDH, a conversion of 39% and a selectivity of 85% can be obtained after 150 h of time-on-stream at 580 °C, with frequent regenerations at 650 °C. These values are the highest among those reported for Ga-based dehydrogenation catalysts. However, which metal, Pt or Ga, is predominately responsible for the high activity of this catalyst, is not discussed.
In recent work by Sattler et al., a 3 wt % Ga/Al2O3 catalyst was promoted with 1000 ppm of Pt and 0.25 wt % of K to obtain a highly active, selective, and stable PDH catalyst. (248) Evidently, the function of K was to reduce coke formation by poisoning Brønsted acid sites. However, Pt is believed to act as a promoter for the GaOx. Indeed, albeit 1000 ppm Pt/Al2O3 was found to be virtually inactive, 1000 ppm of Pt in combination with 3 wt % Ga afforded conversions close to the equilibrium and an propylene selectivity <95%. In the absence of Pt, propane conversion is more than halved. It was suggested that the role of Pt is to assist hydrogen desorption, which facilitates the regeneration of the gallium hydride hydroxide species. The catalytic data on the Ga-based formulations discussed above are summarized in Table 7.

The development and characterization of vanadium oxide-based catalysts as alternatives for paraffin dehydrogenation have been driven by several factors and have evolved significantly since the 1980s. This review section will explore the historical context, factors influencing research, and the behavior of vanadium species in these catalysts.

Factors driving exploration:
1. The need for more cost-effective and environmentally friendly alternatives to platinum and chromium oxide catalysts, which are expensive, rare, or hazardous [10.1002/chem.201302420].
2. Increasing demand for light olefins and insufficient capacity of current production methods [10.1016/j.jcat.2005.11.005].
3. The potential for improved selectivity and stability in alkane-to-olefin conversion processes [10.1016/j.jcat.2005.11.005].
4. The versatility of vanadium oxide-based catalysts in various oxidation reactions [10.1016/s0926-860x(97)00021-5].

Evolution of research since the 1980s:
1. Initial focus on oxidative dehydrogenation using vanadium-magnesium mixed oxides [10.1021/cr5002436\_3].
2. Expansion to non-oxidative dehydrogenation and a wider range of vanadium oxide-based catalysts [10.1021/cr5002436\_3].
3. Increased emphasis on understanding structure-activity relationships and the influence of support materials [10.1016/s0926-860x(97)00021-5].
4. Development of mixed metal carbides, particularly vanadium-doped molybdenum carbides [10.1002/chem.201302420].
5. Exploration of various characterization techniques such as XANES, Raman, and UV-visible spectroscopy to better understand catalyst structure and behavior [10.1016/j.jcat.2007.07.015].

Variables influencing vanadium species behavior:
1. Carrier type: Different supports (e.g., Al2O3, SiO2, TiO2) significantly affect the structure and properties of supported vanadia species [10.1016/j.jcat.2007.07.015]. The reactivity trend follows CeO2 > ZrO2 > TiO2 > Nb2O5 > Al2O3 > SiO2 [10.1016/s0926-860x(97)00021-5].

2. Support surface area: Higher surface areas generally allow for better dispersion of active sites [10.1021/cr900122]. The measured surface area decreases with increasing vanadium loading, from 104 m2/g for 1 wt% V to 77 m2/g for 8 wt% V [10.1016/j.cattod.2008.07.022].

3. Metal loading: The concentration of vanadium on the support influences the type of vanadium species formed. At low loadings, isolated monomeric vanadia species dominate, while at higher loadings, these condense into polyvanadates and eventually form bulk V2O5 crystallites [10.1016/j.jcat.2007.07.015].

4. Oxidation state: Both V4+ and V3+ species are active in dehydrogenation, with V4+ potentially showing higher activity [10.1006/jcat.2001.3329].

5. Preparation method and calcination temperature: These factors influence the dispersion and nature of vanadium species on the support [10.1016/j.apcata.2004.05.050].

The interplay of these variables affects the catalyst's performance, stability, and selectivity in paraffin dehydrogenation reactions. For example, polymeric vanadia clusters favor the formation of butenes and butadienes, while more isolated species promote the formation of polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbons [10.1016/j.cattod.2008.07.022].



Integrative understanding and prospective outlook: The development of vanadium oxide-based catalysts for paraffin dehydrogenation has shown significant progress over the past few decades. The research has evolved from simple oxidative dehydrogenation studies to complex investigations of structure-activity relationships and the influence of various support materials and preparation methods.

Future research directions may include:

1. Exploring novel support materials or mixed oxide supports to further enhance catalyst performance and stability.
2. Investigating the potential of vanadium-based catalysts in other related reactions, such as oxidative coupling of methane or selective oxidation of short-chain alkanes.
3. Developing advanced in-situ characterization techniques to better understand the dynamic behavior of vanadium species under reaction conditions.
4. Utilizing computational modeling to predict optimal catalyst compositions and structures for specific reactions.
5. Exploring the potential of vanadium-based catalysts in emerging fields such as biomass conversion or CO2 utilization.

These future directions could lead to the development of more efficient and sustainable catalytic processes for the production of valuable chemical intermediates and fuels.
