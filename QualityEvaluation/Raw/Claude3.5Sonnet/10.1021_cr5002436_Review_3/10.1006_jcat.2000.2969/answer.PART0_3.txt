The given literature does not directly address the factors driving exploration of vanadium oxide catalysts as alternatives to Pt and CrOx for paraffin dehydrogenation, nor does it discuss how research in this area has evolved since the 1980s. The document also does not provide information on how variables like carrier type, support surface area, and metal loading influence the nature and behavior of vanadium species in these catalysts.

The literature focuses on a specific study of an alumina-supported vanadium oxide catalyst for butane dehydrogenation, examining its activity after various reduction treatments. It does not provide the broader historical and comparative context asked about in the question.

给定的文献并未直接讨论推动钒氧化物催化剂作为Pt和CrOx替代品用于烷烃脱氢的因素,也没有讨论自1980年代以来该领域研究的演变情况。文档也没有提供载体类型、载体表面积和金属负载量如何影响这些催化剂中钒物种的性质和行为的信息。

该文献主要关注氧化铝负载的钒氧化物催化剂在丁烷脱氢中的一项具体研究,考察了各种还原处理后催化剂的活性。它没有提供问题中询问的更广泛的历史和比较背景。
