Abstract 
The influence of the impregnation pH (at 2-11) and molybdenum content (6-18 wt.-% MOO,) on 
the surface structure of Mo03/A1203 and MoO,/SiO, 
catalysts has been studied by temperature-pro- 
grammed reduction, X-ray diffraction and zeta potential measurements. The results indicate that mol- 
ybdena was relatively well dispersed on A&O3 support, the dispersion being worse for the catalysts pre- 
pared in acidic medium than for those in basic medium; formation of a crystalline phase was observed 
only at a pH of 2 and for MOO, loadings > 14 wt.-%. However, on SiOz support only crystalline MOO, 
species were found, irrespective of the preparation conditions. In this case the temperature-programmed 
reduction profiles suggest the presence of two MoOB bulk phases which may probably differ in crystal 
size, and whose proportion depends on the pH of the impregnating solution.

INTRODUCTION 
The nature and surface distribution of the molybdenum species present on 
supported molybdena catalysts, which depend strongly on the preparation con- 
ditions (impregnation procedure, molybdenum loading, pH of impregnation, 
drying and calcination conditions, nature of the support, etc. ) 
, have been the

subject of numerous investigations using various physico-chemical techniques 
[l-6 
and references therein], including temperature-programmed reduction 
(TPR). This technique has provided very useful information on the nature 
and the strength of the interaction between the molybdenum species and sup- 
port [ 781. Recently, the sensitivity of the TPR technique to detect the changes 
in the surface structure of alumina-supported molybdena catalysts produced 
by phosphorus incorporation has been shown [ 9,101. Since the phosphorus is 
usually added as phosphoric acid, which implies the use of impregnating solu- 
tions with different pH, depending on the preparation method and the loadings 
of phosphorus and active metal, it is thus interesting to determine the influ- 
ence of the pH of the impregnating solution, independently of the effect of 
phosphorus. 
The effect of the impregnation pH on the adsorption of the molybdenum 
species and the final structure of the MOO, catalysts has been examined in 
various studies [2-6,111, generally using Raman spectroscopy and, recently, 
molybdenum-95 NMR spectroscopy [6,11]. In spite of the experimental sim- 
plicity of the TPR technique it has not been used to examine systematically 
the effect of the impregnation pH on the structure of Mo03/A1203 catalysts. A 
recent work [ 121 deals specifically with the influence of the impregnation pH 
on the MoOJSiO, 
system, but it was limited to a fixed loading of 8 wt.-% 
MOO,. Since it would be interesting to examine the pH effect for catalysts 
covering a wide range of molybdenum loadings, we report in this work a com- 
parative study of the effect of the impregnation pH on the structure of MOO, 
supported on A1203 and Si02 by a combined use of TPR, X-ray diffraction 
(XRD ), and zeta potential measurements. 
EXPERIMENTAL 
Preparation of catalysts 
Catalysts with various MOO, loadings (6-18 wt.-% ) were prepared by wet 
impregnation of the supports, y-alumina (BASF D-1010, surface area= 230 m2 
g-l, total pore volume at p/p0 0.9975 = 0.49 cm3 g-l, micropore volume = 0.003 
cm3 g- ’ ) and silica (BDH, surface area = 505 m2 g-l, total pore volume at 
p/p0 0.9984 =0.33 cm3 gg’
, micropore volume= 0.072 cm3 g-l), both crushed 
and sized to 0.15-0.25 mm, with aqueous solutions of ammonium heptamolyb- 
date of appropriate concentration and at different pH (range 2-11). When 
necessary, the pH was adjusted by using nitric acid or NHIOH solutions. Ex- 
cess water was removed in a rotary evaporator at 60’
 C under reduced pressure 
for ca. 2 h. The samples were dried at 120°C for 8 h and then calcined in air, 
usually at 550°C for 4 h; in some cases additional samples were calcined at 
lower temperatures, 200,300 or 400°C in order to examine the genesis of the 
supported molybdenum species. Calcined catalysts were kept in closed tubes. 
127 
Catalysts (Table 1) are denoted by the wt.-% of MOO, content of the support 
(A= A&,0,; S = Si02), followed by the pH of the impregnation solution, e.g., 
Mo( 18)A-11 contains 18 wt.-% MOO, on A120, and was prepared at pH= 11. 
Physicochemical techniques 
Surface areas of the catalysts were determined by nitrogen adsorption (BET 
method) using a Micromeritics-2100E sorptometer. X-ray diffraction patterns 
were obtained with a Philips PW 1030/10 diffractometer using Cu Kcu radia- 
tion with a nickel filter. Electrophoretic migration measurements were carried 
out in a Zeta-Meter Instrument (Model ZM-77) using 200 mg of 2 ,um 
samples 
dispersed in 200 ml of 10e3 A4 KC1 solution as reported in a previous study 
[131. 
The TPR profiles of the catalysts calcined at 500’
 C were carried out in a 
conventional apparatus consisting in a quartz reactor attached to a thermal 
conductivity detector. The sample (250 mg) was pretreated in situ at 550°C 
for 2 h, followed by cooling to room temperature, then heating up to 1000”
 C at 
a rate of 10°C min-’
 in a 70% H,/Ar gas mixture. The water produced was 
trapped in 13X zeolite. Hydrogen consumption was measured with a thermal 
conductivity detector. Samples were precalcined in situ at 550’
 C for 2 h prior 
to the TPR run. Details of the TPR measurements are given in ref. 9. 
RESULTS 
Surface area and XRD 
Table 1 shows that the specific surface area of calcined catalysts decreased 
slightly with increasing molybdenum loading, probably due to blocking of the 
narrower pores of the support. A marked decrease in surface area for catalysts 
prepared at high and low pH values was also observed. This effect was more 
pronounced for the SiO,-supported catalysts than for the Al,O,-supported ones, 
particularly at high pH. This is due to the higher microporosity of the SiOz 
(see Experimental) and to its high solubility at high pH, as compared with 
those of A1203 [ 141. It is well known [ 151 that at pH > 9 the smaller particles 
of amorphous SiOz are readily dissolved, and subsequently are deposited on 
the larger particles when oversaturation is reached. This process drastically 
decreases the surface area of the SiO,. On the other hand, the moderate de- 
crease in surface area of the acidic-prepared Al,O,-supported catalysts is prob- 
ably caused by the solubility of A1203 
at pH I3 [ 141. 
The XRD patterns of all the Al,O,-supported catalysts, except the MO 
( 18)A- 
2, did not differ significantly from that of the A1203, which is in accordance 
with the literature [ 10,16,17]. However, the diffractogram of the MO 
(18)A-2 
catalyst calcined at 550 o 
C (Fig. la) showed notably the main lines of MOO,

and Al, ( 
Mood),, the later phase probably being formed during the impregna- 
tion step [lo]. 
However, attempts to confirm this genesis of Al,(MoO,), 
by 
XRD study of MO 
(18)A-2 samples calcined at 300 and 400”
 C failed; their 
diffractograms showed lines hardly distinguishable from the background of 
A1203, 
due probably to poor crystallinity of the Al, (MOO,) 3 
species. 
In the case of SiOz-supported catalysts, the detection of diffraction lines 
whose positions are in good agreement with crystalline MOO, occurred at rel- 
atively low (6 wt.-% MOO,) loading and even at basic pH, as Figs. lb and c 
show, but their relative intensities do not completely agree with Moos. These 
lines were significantly more intense at acidic pH, and obviously at high mo- 
lybdenum loadings. The sharpness of the lines suggests that the MOO, phase 
formed is highly crystalline. In none of the SiO,-supported catalysts were lines 
different from those of MOO, observed. On the other hand, the diffractograms 
of the SiO,-supported catalysts only dried at 120°C were more complex than 
those of catalysts calcined at 550’
 C. The patterns corresponding to the dried

(ASTM 37-381) can be 
appreciated, they are more intense for the acidic samples, which, effectively, 
exhibited the characteristic yellow color of 12-molybdosilicic acid. This color 
was still visible in the MO 
(18) S-2 samples calcined at 200 and 300’
 C, and 
changed to white-greenish after calcination at 400”
 C. Consistently, the XRD 
patterns of such samples calcined at 200 and 300’
 C were essentially similar to 
that of the 120”
Cdried 
sample, while the pattern of the Mo(18)S-2 
sample 
calcined at 400’
 C was already similar to that exhibited for the 550”
 C-calcined 
samples, i.e., only showing the major lines of crystalline MOO,. These results 
indicate that the molybdosilicic species initially present in the dried samples 
are obviously destroyed by calcination between 300 and 400°C. This is in 
agreement with one previous report [18] and in disagreement with others 
[ 19,201. In the diffractograms of Fig. 2 a line also appears which could be

ite ) 
, although in a small proportion. 
Electrophoretic measurements 
The zero point of charge (ZPC) of all the calcined catalysts, obtained from 
zeta potential vs. pH curves [ 131, are presented in Table 1. 
For the purpose of a better comparison, Fig. 3 shows the variation of the ZPC 
131 
with the molybdenum loading for the catalysts prepared at pH 2 and 11. For 
the alumina supported catalysts, an initial region (loadings < 10 wt.-% MOO,) 
in which the ZPC decreased nearly linearly with increasing molybdenum con- 
tents was observed, indicating that molybdenum is highly dispersed on A1203. 
Then another region followed (loading lo-15 wt.-% MOO,) in which the ZPC 
was nearly constant and close to the isoelectric point of 6.2 of bulk MOO,, 
indicating that the molybdenum is forming multilayers or MOO, clusters grow- 
ing vertically. Finally, for MOO, loadings 2 18 wt.-% a further small decrease 
in the ZPC was appreciated, which could be attributed to the presence of 
Al, ( 
MOO,), species (isoelectric point < 6), as detected by XRD. 
For the SiO,-supported catalysts, Fig. 3 shows that the ZPC did not change 
significantly with increasing molybdenum loadings, suggesting that most of 
the SiO, surface is free from molybdenum, which would be present predomi- 
nantly as large crystallites of MOO,. 
TPR 
The TPR profiles of MoO,/Al,O, 
and MoOJSiO, catalysts containing equal 
molybdenum loadings (14 wt.-% MOO,) and prepared at different impregna- 
tion pH’
s are presented in Figs. 4a and b, respectively. The two sets of TPR 
were clearly different. 
The TPR profiles of all the AlzO,-supported catalysts (Fig. 4a) exhibited 
the two reduction regions previously found [ 71. No significant changes in the 
profiles with the pH were observed, except a small increase in the intensity of 
the first peak at T,,,=41O”
C 
(T,,, -temperature at which the reduction rate 
is maximal) and the appearance of a small shoulder at about 480°C for the 
sample prepared at pH = 2. 
On the contrary, in the SiO,-supported catalysts the TPR profiles displayed 
generally three reduction peaks, which were very sensitive to the impregnating 
pH (Fig. 4b). The more relevant differences were: (i) the first peak, 
T,,, = 490’
 C, increased generally with increasing pH from 2 to 8; (ii ) the sec- 
ond peak, T,,, = 6OO”
C, varied oppositely to the first one; and (iii) the third 
peak, T,,, = 680-7OO”
C, did not change sensibly with pH, except for the ap- 
pearance of a small shoulder about 750°C for the catalysts prepared at acidic 
pH. For comparison, we show in the inset of Fig. 4 the TPR profile of bulk 
MOO,, which exhibit two peaks with features rather similar to those of the 
Mo( 14)S-2 sample, but shifted about 25 or 50°C towards higher reduction 
temperatures. 
The effect of molybdenum loading on A1203 at impregnation pH values 2 
and 11 is shown in Fig. 5. The main differences in the TPR profiles between 
samples prepared at different pH’
s were observed for the 6 and 18 wt.-% MOO, 
loadings catalysts. Thus the Mo(6)A-2 
catalysts exhibited practically only a 
reduction peak in the high temperature region (T,,, cz 
849”

MO 
(6)A-11 catalysts presented two well defined peaks at ca. 445 and ca. 770’
 C, 
respectively. For the catalysts with 18 wt.-% MOO, the appearance of a new 
peak ( 
T,,, = 495’
 C ) in the preparation at pH = 2, and the absence of the peak 
for the homologous preparation at pH= 11, are remarkable. The peak at 
T,,, = 495 o 
C was also detected in the catalysts MO 
(14)A-2. 
A similar comparison for the SiO,-supported catalysts is presented in Fig. 6. 
In this case, at all the molybdenum loadings there are noticeable differences 
between the TPR patterns of the catalysts prepared in basic and acidic pH. 
For instance, in the TPR profile of the MO 
(6)S-11 only two broad peaks were 
found, while the profile of the Mo(6)S2 
exhibited four reduction peaks.

of the Al,O,-sup- 
ported catalysts as a function of the temperature, are given in Fig. 7. In general, 
the reducibility of the Al,O,-supported catalysts increased with increasing mo- 
lybdenum loading, and was higher for the one prepared at pH = 11 than for the

one prepared at pH = 2. In contrast, for the SiO,-supported catalysts no sig- 
nificant differences in reducibility could be appreciated among them: the ex- 
tent of reduction at the end of the TPR was always total, i.e., all the molyb- 
denum species present were reduced to Moo ((Y 
= 1). 
DISCUSSION 
Significant differences were observed in the TPR profiles of the A1203- and 
SiO,-supported molybdena catalysts when varying the molybdenum content 
and/or the pH of the impregnating solution, suggesting changes in the nature 
and distribution of the molybdenum species on the surface of the catalysts. 
Some of these TPR-monitored changes were, however, not detected by XRD. 
For the interpretation of the TPR profiles we recall the information ob- 
tained in our previous TPR study [ 71 on Al,O,-supported molybdena catalysts 
at thermo-reduction conditions similar to the present ones. The first peak at 
405°C 
was attributed to the first reduction step (Mo6+ +Mo4+ ) of octahe- 
drally coordinated molybdenum species (MO,) weakly bound to A1,03, pre- 
134 
dominantly 
as multilayer 
molybdenum 
domains, with some polymolybdates 
in 
monolayer 
patches. On this basis, the observed increase in the intensity 
of the 
first peak of A&O,-supported 
catalysts 
with increasing 
molybdenum 
content 
(Fig. 5)) and also with decreasing 
pH (Figs. 4a and 5), indicates 
that such 
variations 
in the two preparational 
parameters 
lead to an increase 
of the pro- 
portion 
of the octahedral 
reducible 
molybdenum 
species, as shown in Fig. 7. 
This increase 
of MO, species upon decreasing 
the impregnation 
pH, can be 
understood 
by considering 
that the impregnation 
pH controls 
the proportion 
of 
MOO:- 
and 
Mo,Oz, 
through 
the 
equilibrium 
7MoOi- 
+ 
8H+ +Mo,O& 
+4Hz0 
and also the surface charge of the support 
according 
to its IEP. It is well known 
[ 141 that the adsorption 
of anions is enhanced 
when the support 
is positively 
charged, which is the case for Al,O, when the 
pH of the impregnating 
solution is lower than its IEP value of ca. 8.8. Another 
factor to be considered 
is that Al,O, preferentially 
adsorbs Mo,O!j’
; , leaving 
MOO:- in the solution into the pore as a result of a basic buffer effect 
[ 111. 
Thus, at pH I5 and high concentration 
of molybdenum 
in the impregnating 
solution, 
although 
the adsorption 
of the predominant 
Mo,O;; 
species [6] is 
favoured, 
a considerable 
amount of molybdenum 
remains in the solution since 
its concentration 
is relatively 
high. Consequently, 
when the solvent is removed 
the unadsorbed 
Mo,O!& 
species will precipitate 
and/or 
polymerize, 
and upon 
drying and calcination 
they will form a heterogeneous 
deposit 
of polymeric 
molybdenum 
species on the A1203, and even MOO, crystallites, 
as occurs in the 
case of the MO (14)A-2 and MO (18)A-2 catalysts. 
The presence 
of crystalline 
MOO,, together 
with A12(Mo04)3, 
in the MO (18)A-2 
was confirmed 
by the 
XRD results (Fig. 1) , and by the appearance 
in the TPR profile of a new peak, 
T,,, = 490’ C, well defined and relatively 
intense. This peak was also observed 
in similar 
molybdenum 
catalysts 
containing 
phosphorus 
[9,10]. 
In the 
MO (14)A-2 catalyst the presence of crystalline 
MOO, was not detected by XRD, 
likely due to the small size of the aggregates 
or crystals, but it was revealed by 
TPR by the small shoulder exhibited 
at ca. 480 o 
C (Fig. 4a). 
In the preparations 
at pH 2 8 the solutions 
contain predominantly 
MOO:- 
species. At these pH values the alumina is negatively 
charged and therefore 
no 
adsorption 
of anions occurs. Thus the unadsorbed 
species deposited 
on the 
alumina 
after drying will be essentially 
MOO!-. 
This then leads to a minor 
proportion 
of molybdenum 
in polymeric 
form or as MoOB crystallites, 
as sug- 
gest the TPR profiles of the Mo( 14)A-11 and Mo( 18)A-11 catalysts 
(absence 
of a peak at ca. 480-490°C)) 
and hence to less reducibility, 
than for the ho- 
mologous catalysts 
prepared 
at pH < 8 (Fig. 7). This is in line with the findings 
derived from the ZPC results 
(Fig. 3), that the molybdenum 
dispersion 
on 
alumina-supported 
catalysts 
was generally 
lower at pH 11 than on those pre- 
pared at pH 2. 
Comparing 
the TPR profiles of the SiO,-supported 
to the Al,O,-supported 
catalysts, 
the absence of the peak at T,,, = 410’ C in the silica catalysts 
indi- 
135 
cates that, in contrast to the alumina catalysts, they do not contain Mo, species 
in monolayer and/or multilayer form. The explanation is that on SiO, 
(IEP z 2.5) practically no adsorption of anions occurs since its surface is neg- 
atively charged in almost the whole pH range studied. In addition, the inter- 
action of the oxomolybdenum species with SiOZ is very weak. 
In contrast with the AlaOs-supported catalysts, all the SiO,-supported cat- 
alysts showed the peak at T,,, - 
- 490’
 C, which is indicative of a discrete MOO, 
phase. The similarity of the TPR of bulk MOO, (peaks at 625 and 760”
 C) with 
the TPR profiles of some SiO,-supported catalysts, e.g. the MO 
(14) S-2 cata- 
lysts (peaks at ca. 600 and ca. 700’
 C ) , can clearly be seen by comparing Fig. 6 
and the inset of Fig. 4b. The presence of small crystals of MOO, in the silica 
catalysts was corroborated by the XRD results (Fig. lb and c). This MOO, 
phase, which gave rise to the peak at ca. 490”
 C, developed further with increas- 
ing pH of impregnation (Fig. 4b). However, in the alumina supported catalysts 
the effect of the pH was contrary, as Fig. 4a shows. Another significant differ- 
ence between the A1203- and SiO,-supported catalysts is that for the latter 
there appeared a second peak ( T_ - 
- 600 o 
C ), very close to that corresponding 
to the first reduction step of bulk Mo03. This peak at ca. 600°C intensified 
with decreasing pH of impregnation, conversely to the trend followed by the 
peak at ca. 490°C (Fig. 4b). We conclude that both peaks result from the ex- 
istence of two different MOO, bulk phases which may differ in the size of crys- 
tal or aggregate, and whose proportions are strongly dependent on the impreg- 
nation pH. The MOO, phase predominant at acidic pH, which gives rise to the 
peak at 6OO”
C, may have a larger crystal size than that predominant at basic 
pH values. This is supported by the fact that the diffraction patterns of the 
catalysts prepared at pH 2 exhibited a higher sharpness than those prepared 
at pH 11, as Fig. 1 shows. This Moo3 phase which forms predominantly at 
acidic pH values may result from the unadsorbed Mo,O& 
species, and also 
from the decomposition of the molybdosilicic acid which was formed during 
the impregnation. However, the more abundant MOO, phase at basic pH 
( 
T,,, = 490’
 C ), apparently more disperse than that predominant at acidic pH, 
may result from unadsorbed MOO;- anions, which are predominant at basic 
pH. The lower temperature of reduction of the MOO, phase at basic pH is 
thought to be caused by the relatively smaller size of its crystals, as compared 
to that in the catalysts prepared at basic pH. An additional reason could be 
that the MOO, phase may be finely mixed with the precipitated SiOa proceed- 
ing from the partial solubilization occurring during the impregnation at pH 
> 9. 
Finally, the peak at 680-700 o 
C in the TPR profiles is ascribed to the second 
step of reduction of the MOO, species in the case of SiO,-supported catalysts, 
and to the partial reduction of molybdenum species strongly bound to the sup- 
port in A&O,-supported catalysts.
