Role of Surface Area in 
Dehydrocvclization Catalysis 
J 
H E  deposition of active 
T 
agents onto adsorbents 
has been employed widely to 
provide catalysts of increased 
sctivity, improved stability, 
greater selectivity, more con- 
renient physical form, and 
ioR-er 
cost (11). The develop- 
ment of a simple method for 
measuring surface areas of 
porous materials (1) 
provided 
a basis for correlating infor- 
mation on the action of ad- 
sorbents in this application. 
This work was undertaken to 
examine the relation of ad- 
sorbent area to catalyst ac- 
tivity for molybdena impreg-

-4ctivated aluminas were impregnated with varying 
quantities of molybdena and their catalytic activities 
determined for dehydrocyclization of n-heptane to toluene 
at atmospheric pressure. Activity increased nearly line- 
arly w-ith added molj-bdena until a concentration de- 
pendent on the alumina area was attained. Excess molyb- 
dena beyond this value did not further increase activity. 
Activated aluminas of varying area were impregnated with 
constant amounts of molybdena and tested. -4ctivity in- 
creased linearly with surface area to a value dependent on 
the molybdena concentration. 
Further increase of area 
produced much less rapid increase of activity. Compari- 
son of the calculated molybdena area w-ith the experi- 
mental value for maximum activity shows that the alum- 
ina surface is covered with a monolayer of molybdena at 
maximum activity. Activity was relatively insensitive to 
change in particle size from 2 to 20 mesh. 
as a catalyst for the dehydrocyclization of n-heptane t,o toluene. 
This reaction was reported with a variety of catalysts prepared 
in diverse manners on a 
number of supports (4, 5, 7, 9, 14, 15). 
Investigation of the reaction mechanism indicates that an initial 
dehydrogenation is followed by cyclization and further dehydro- 
genation (8, 17, 18). Carbon skeleton rearrangement can take 
dace on a chromia-alumina catalyst (10;. 
MATERIALS, APPARATUS, AND ASALYSIS 
The activated aluminas were products of the Aluminum Ore 
Company. 
The activated alumina F series analyzed: 2y0 loss 
m ignition, 0.1% iYazO, 0.1% Sios, 0.05% FenOs, and 0.77, C1. 
The activated alumina H series analyzed: 4% loss on ignition, 
0.1% hTa20, 
7% SiOz, 0.27, FenOs, 
0.3% CaO, 0.2'3 MgO, and 
@.3% 
SOo. .Ictivated aluminas of the H series have one and a 
half to three times the surface area and pore volume, and more 
uniform pore widths as determined by sorption, than do those 
of the F aeries.

snd dried with activated alumina was used for catalyst reduction. 
Ammonium paramolyb- 
date was dissolved in distilled m-ater (0.5 nil. per gram of alumina 
in the completed catalyst), and the quantity of concentrated 
ammonia necessary to convert the paraniolybdate to the normal 
molybdak was added. The solution was boiled and the alumina 
added iuimediately with vigorous stirring. The excess water 
was removed by drying at 70-90' C. under overhead heat, with 
occasional stirring. 
When the alumina appeared dry, in 4-6 
hours, the sample was calcined 16 hours at 500" C.

plied to the reaction bulb by 
a well insulated furnace F containing three separately controlled 
coils. Temperatures are measured by chromel-alumel couples 
held by a four-hole porcelain tube in an axial well of the reaction 
bulb. 
One couple is set at the geometric renter of each of the 
heating coils. The product of the reaction is cooled by water

The liquid product from n-heptane dehydrocyclization was 
assumed to be toluene, unreacted heptane, and small quantities 
of heptenes (8, 14). Toluene was determined by density or re- 
fractive index on the assumption that the heptenes present have 
the density or index of n-heptane. 
Liquid olefinic hydrocarbons,' 
calculated as heptenes, were determined by titrating a 2-ml. 
sample in 10 ml. of 10% sulfuric acid at 18-20" C. with 0.5 N 
potassium bromide-potassium bromate, adding an 0.4ml. incre- 
ment which was not decolorized, shaking 2 minutes, and back- 
titrating with 0.2 A- sodium thiosulfate. 
These analyses were 
consistent with toluene plus olefinic hydrocarbons; 
the latter 
were determined by the volume change in a 10-ml, sample shaken 
with 30 ml. of a 
solution made by dissolving 100 grams of phos- 
phorous pentoxide in 300 ml. of 95% sulfuric acid. 
The amount of coke deposited on the catalyst was determined 
as the sum of carbon plus hydrogen measured by combustion of 
a representative sample of the catalyst after the heptane run. 
Analyses showed the coke to have the approximate composition 
CH. This value of coke deposition was found to agree well with 
the weight increase of the catalyst during the run corrected for 
the weight loss of molybdena on reduction. 
For'the standard 
catalyst this reduction correction was found to be 1.0 gram. 
EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURE 
Unless a statement is made to the contrary, all the catalysts 
were run as follows: Catalyst sample, screened t o  4-8 mesh, was 
heated 16

At 
the end of the reduction period the hydrogen \\-as turned off and 
the heptane flow st,arted. The furnace temperature was con- 
trolled either manually or by instrument during the run PO that 
each of the thermocouples was as close as possible to the desired 
temperature. Temperature readings at the start of the run 
sometimes varied 15' C. from the setting but usually averaged 
within 1
'
 of the desired temperature. The molecular might of 
the gas stream was determined during the last 0.25 hour of the 
run. The system was flushed with hydrogen after the run, and 
air was excluded from the bulb while it was weighed. 
Surface areas were measured by the method of Brunauer, 
Emmett, and Teller (I), 
employing the sorption of n-butane at 
0' C. Results are expressed as the millimoles of n-butane which 
just cover the area of 1 gram of alumina in the sample (m.b./g.). 
Values of area in square meters per gram are obtained by multi- 
plying the foregoing values by J93 if the area of the n-butane 
molecule is taken as 32 square A. (3). In the range of molyb- 
dena concentrations and temperatures employed, the prcscnce of 
reduced molybdena on the alumina does not change the area of 
the latter appreciably.

through tlie catalyst at 1.5 to 2 cubic fcet per hour. 
CALCULATIONS 
The activity of a test catalyst is defined as the ratio of n-hep- 
tane feed rate for the test catalyst to the feed rate for a standard 
catalyst when each catalyst produces the 
same TO, which in this paper stands for 
the integral percentage of toluene plus ole- 
finic hydrocarbons in the liquid reaction 
product. The catalyst selectd as stnnd- 
ard is an activated alumina F 
of area 0.38 
m.b./g. impregnated to an atoniic ratio of 
InOlgbdeIIum to aluminum of 0.05. To 
determine activity, it is convenient first 
to measure and graph TO produccd by 
standard catalyst as a function of feed rate. 
TO 
from the test catalyst at a givcn feed 
rate is measured, and the feed ratc at 
which standard catalyst produces this TO 
is determined from the graph. Activity 
is computed as test catalyst few1 rate 
divided by the standard catalyst Iced rate. 
This concept must br conditionccl to tlw 
fact that TO changes rapidly as tlie run 
progresses (16). In establisliing the graph 
of 2'0 against feed rate, tlic s(aiiclnrd 
catalyst was run at each ferd rate for 
such a duration that its coke deposition 
was 4.0 grams per 100 ml. of catalyst. 
The test catalyst \vas run at a convenient 
feed rate and temperRtiirc for the dura- 
tion that would givt. 4.0 grams of coke per 
100 ml. of standard catalyst. 
Usually 
100-mi. catalyst volume, 2.3-nil. liquid 
feed per hour, 497" C., and 1.5-hour 
duration were employed for the test, 
catalyst. 
The yields from a run are defined as 
1007, times the milliliters of heptane 
reacted to form the given product, divided 
by the total milliliters of heptanc reacted. 
RESULTS WITH STANDARD CATILYST 
Although the ability of the c:Ltalyst, to 
cause reaction diminishes as the reac- 
tion proceeds, the catalj-st can be re- 
stored to its original activity by buriiing 
off the coke. 
Used standard catalyst heated 16 hours in air 
at, 360-400" C. was gray in color and shonetl activity, after 
standard reduction. ouly 80% that of the origirial sample- 
that is, activity 0.8. Heating 16 hours in air at 500" C. pro- 
duced a light ycllow catalyst of activity 1.0 after the same re- 
duction. Prolonged heating in air or oxygcn at 500" C. did 
not further increase activity. 
If the standard catalyst is properly burned but is not reduced 
in hydrogen before the run, its activity is about 0.7. 
Activity 
increases with increased reduction temperature to 500 
O C. (hy- 
drogen flow rate 2 cubic feet per hour, duration 1.5 hours), 
with hydrogen flow rate to 1 cubic foot per hour (temperature 
500" C., duration 1.5 hours), and with duration of reduction to 
I hour (temperature 500" C., flow rate 2 cubic feet per hour). 
At standard reduction of 2 cubic feet per hour of hydrogen for 
1.5 
houk at 500" C. the activity is 1.0. More vigorous reduc- 
tion produces relatively smaller changes in activity. 
Thcse 
findings agree with the statement that actiT'ity is greater, the 
more complete the reduction (12). 
Itesults of five tests xith standard catalyst show rcproduci- 
bility within 37, TO and 2% yield. These data are collected 
in Table I. Runs with nonstandard catalysts are usually re- 
producible to 0.1 activity unit and 270 yield. 
The dependence of TO on feed rate is shown in Figure 2. 
The reaction has a high temperature coefficient, TO increasing 
roughly 0.870 
per, ' 
C. at a flow rate of 25 ml. per hour. 
The sum of toluene plus olefinic hydrocarbon yields is

RELATION OF AREA TO hl0LYBDES.i COSCESTR 4TICS 
The results of Figure 3 show that actiyity of impregnated ac- 
tivated alumina F, area 0.47 m.b /g., increases linearly to 1.18 
with increasing molybdena from atomic ratio N o  
!AI 0.000 to 
0.052 and, at a higher ratio, activity is constant. Thus, to at- 
tain maximum activity, an alumina area of 0.090 m.b./g. is re- 
quired for each increment of 0.01 in the atomic ratio on these 
samples. 
Yields change uith molybdenum to aluminum ratio 
up to 0.06 and tliercafter remain constant (Figure 41, in approxi- 
mate agrecmcnt with the activity cliange,.. 
A series of activated aluminas of type F having areas up to 1.03 
m.h./g. was iniprrgnated to No/.il 0.05 and tested. Figure 5 
show that activity increases linearly to 1.15 as area increases 
to 0.43 m.h. ' g ,

activated alumina F, 497’ C.. 13 ml. per hour feed rate 
have been ubserved with increase of area. The linear increase in 
activity with impregnated area implies that diffusion is of minor 
importance in establishing the dehydrocyclization rat,e for the 
samples tested. Further evidence for this is the relatively small 
influence of particlc size on activity (Table 11). In the extreme 
case of rcaction limited to the geometric surface, or for high values 
of Thiele’s modulus (19), 
the reaction rate might increase fivefold 
on decreasing part’icle size from 2-4 to 14-28 mesh. The ob- 
served change in activity vas relat,ively small (Table 11) and 
there is evidence that it may not be due to change in diffusion 
path, since a low area (\Tide pore) alumina, in which diffusion 
rates should be of 
lesser influence, shows as great 
change in 
activity with particle size as does the narrow pore alumina.
