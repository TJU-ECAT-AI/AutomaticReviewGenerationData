Thermally stable mesoporous gallium and gallium–aluminum (atomic ratio of Ga/Al=4/1 and 1/4) oxides
with controlled textural and structural properties were prepared by means of the nanocasting approach.
All materials have uniform micron-sized particles, with a quite narrow pore-size distribution centered in
the range of 6.2–6.5 nm and speciﬁc surface areas as high as 231–322 m2·g−1. Pure mesoporous gallium
and gallium–aluminum (Ga/Al=4:1) oxides exhibit a promising catalytic performance in the dehydrogena-
tion of propane to propene in the presence of CO2 (DHP-CO2). Over the most active materials, during 4 h on
stream at 823 K, propene was produced with the yield of 10–18% and high selectivity of 91–95%. Moreover,
pure mesoporous gallium oxide exerted a higher resistance on deactivation during the DHP-CO2 process in
comparison with gallium oxide prepared without a hard template.

1. Introduction
The synthesis of ordered mesoporous inorganic materials has
attracted a lot of scientiﬁc interest due to their uniform mesopore
sizes, high speciﬁc surface areas and ease of surface functionalization,
which are features important in catalytic applications. A cooperative as-
sembly of inorganic precursors with organic surfactants (soft tem-
plates) by sol–gel method is the most widely applied approach to
mesoporous solid preparation. This soft templating synthesis method
is useful especially in the case of obtaining various families of siliceous
materials (e.g. MCM, SBA). However, it is not suitable for the prepara-
tion of non-siliceous materials because the hydrolysis and polymeriza-
tion of transition-metal alkoxides are harder to control compared to
silica alkoxides [1]. As a result, ﬁnal solids have poor mesopore structure
and low thermal stability after removal of templating agent.
The development of the nanocasting technique opened a new way
for the synthesis of ordered mesoporous inorganic materials. In this
method, a well ordered mesopore structure of the matrix, typically sili-
ceous (e.g. SBA-15, KIT-6) or carbonaceous (e.g. CMK-3, OMC) material
is ﬁlled with a precursor, which is then converted into suitable inorgan-
ic materials by thermal treatment and removal of hard template. Up to
now, many different inorganic materials have been successfully pre-
pared by nanocasting. Preparation procedures, physicochemical prop-
erties and possible applications of nanoreplicas have been discussed
more precisely in several reviews [1–3].
In the last decade, several attempts at preparing ordered mesoporous
Ga2O3 using soft templating approaches have been undertaken [4–6].
The results indicate a difﬁculty with the preparation of thermally sta-
ble mesophase of pure Ga2O3. Although using soft templates yields
surfactant-Ga2O3 mesophase, it ﬁnally collapses during thermal
treatment leading to a formation of low surface area and poorly or-
dered mesoporous Ga2O3. Similar unfavorable thermal transformation
has also been observed in the case of disordered mesoporous γ-Ga2O3,
which was converted into β-Ga2O3 during heating at 1073 K. This
resulted in a loss of speciﬁc surface area from 120 to 40 m2·g−1 and
in a formation of wider pores [7]. Recently, ordered mesoporous Ga2O3
with a high speciﬁc surface area (307 m2·g−1) has been prepared
using nanoreplication [8]. The new method of Ga2O3 synthesis is very
promising from the catalytic point of view because the hard template
provides stable support, removed after high temperature crystallization.
In the case of Ga2O3, the presence of hard template suppresses collapse
of mesopore structure that typically occurs during gallium oxide
recrystallization.
Gallium-containing materials have been widely employed as cata-
lysts in a variety of processes including transformation of alkanes into
aromatic hydrocarbons (CYCLAR process) [9], selective catalytic re-
duction (SCR) of NOx in the presence of hydrocarbons as reducing
agents [10,11], as well as Friedel–Crafts benzylation and acylation re-
actions [12]. Furthermore, bulk Ga2O3 (different polymorphs), Ga2O3
supported on TiO2 and Ga2O3–Al2O3 spinel-type mixed oxides exhibit
a promising catalytic performance in the dehydrogenation of hydro-
carbons in the presence of CO2 [13–19]. This process is considered
as an alternative to the commercial dehydrogenation pathway of

oleﬁns production. CO, which is formed from CO2 as a valuable by-
product, can be additionally applied in chemical synthesis. It was
found that in the dehydrogenation of alkanes (1) carried out over
Ga-containing materials, CO2 enhances the oleﬁn yield and sup-
presses coke deposition by participation in the reverse water–gas
shift (2) and Boudouard (3) reactions, respectively [13–16].
Taking into account the advantages of the nanocasting route and
the promising catalytic performance of Ga-containing materials, we
decided to prepare thermally stable ordered mesoporous Ga2O3 and
Ga2O3–Al2O3 materials using CMK-3 as a hard template. The catalytic
performance of the synthesized materials was investigated in the de-
hydrogenation of propane in the presence of CO2 (DHP-CO2).
2. Experimental
2.1. Preparation of materials
In a polypropylene bottle (250 cm3), 8 g of Pluronic P123 was
dissolved in a solution containing 60 g of distilled water and 120 g
of 2 M HCl at 308 K. The mixture was vigorously stirred until com-
plete dissolution of polymeric surfactant. Subsequently, 17 g of
TEOS (98%, Aldrich) was added dropwise. Finally, the mixture was
stirred (400 rpm) for another 20 h at 308 K and then hydrothermal-
ly treated under static conditions for 24 h at 363 K. The obtained
white precipitate was ﬁltered, dried at 333 K overnight and calcined
in air by raising temperature from ambient to 823 K over 9 h period
and an isothermal step at 823 K for another 12 h.
The prepared SBA-15 material was used as a hard template to the
synthesis of carbon replica, CMK-3 [20]. In typical procedure, 1 g of
SBA-15 was impregnated with a solution containing 5 g of water,
1.25 g of sucrose and 0.14 g of sulfuric acid. The sample was dried
in two steps: at 373 K for 6 h and then at 433 K for another 6 h.
The impregnation and drying procedures were repeated. In the
second impregnation, a solution with 0.8 g of sucrose and 0.09 g of
sulfuric acid dissolved in 3 g of water was used. Carbonization was
completed in ﬂowing N2 by raising temperature (1 K·min−1) up to
1073 K, at which the material was kept for another 12 h. After cooling
to room temperature the carbon–silica composite was washed twice
in 10% hydroﬂuoric solution to remove the silica template.
Mesoporous Ga2O3 (Ga2O3–m) and Ga2O3–Al2O3 (Ga2O3–Al2O3(1/4))
and Ga2O3–Al2O3(4/1) with atomic ratios of Ga/Al=1/4 and 4/1, respec-
tively, were obtained by the incipient wetness impregnation method
according to the modiﬁed procedure reported by Roggenbuck et al. [21].
Unmodiﬁed CMK-3 carbon sieves were impregnated using an aqueous
solution of metal nitrates containing 1 M of metal ions (Ga or Ga+Al).
After impregnation, the materials were heated under air atmosphere to
523 K with a constant rate of 1 K·min−1 in order to decompose metal ni-
trates. This procedure was repeated once. In the ﬁrst and second impreg-
nations volumes of 4.0 cm3 and 3.2 cm3 of solution per 1 g of CMK-3
were used, respectively. Finally, the materials were calcined in two
steps. First, the materials were calcined in an inert gas (N2) atmosphere
by rising temperature from ambient to 1073 K with a rate of 1 K·min−
1 followed by an isothermal step at 1073 K for another 10 h. Subsequent-
ly, after cooling to room temperature the materials were heated again in a
dry air ﬂow using the same program but with the ﬁnal temperature of
873 K.
The reference sample denoted as Ga2O3-t was prepared by the ther-
mal decomposition of commercial Ga(NO3)3 (Fluka AG) at 873 K for
10 h.
2.2. Physicochemical and catalytic characterization
XRD patterns were collected on a Panalytical X'Pert Pro instru-
ment operated at 40 kV and 30 mA, equipped with a Cu Kα X-ray
(λ=0.154 nm) radiation with a step size of 0.0167°.
ICP spectrometry (Perkin Elmer ELAN 6100) was applied for quan-
titative determination of aluminum and gallium content in the
samples.
Morphology and structure of the solids were investigated by
means of JEOL JSM — 7500F Field Emission Scanning Electron Micro-
scope with the EDS (energy dispersive spectra) detection system of
characteristic X-ray radiation equipped with the transmission elec-
tron microscopy detector TED. In the SEM experiments the samples
were deposited on the sample holder. K575X Turbo Sputter Coater
was used for coating the specimens with chromium (deposited ﬁlm
thickness — 20 nm). The specimens for TEM investigation were pre-
pared by depositing a small amount of the powder samples on
holey carbon ﬁlms supported on copper grids.
Nitrogen adsorption–desorption isotherms were measured at
77 K using a Micromeritics ASAP 2020 instrument. Speciﬁc surface
areas were calculated using the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller method
within the relative pressure of P/P0=0.05–0.15. Pore size distribu-
tions were calculated from the desorption branch using the Barrett–
Joyner–Halenda method and the corrected form of the Kelvin equa-
tion proposed by Kruk et al. [22]. Total pore volumes were obtained
from the volumes of nitrogen adsorbed at about P/P0=0.97.
The samples after catalytic runs were analyzed by thermogravimetric
method (TG) in ﬂowing air (100 cm3·min−1) using a SDT Q600 appara-
tus (TA Instruments). Ca. 5 mg of a sample was placed in a corundum
crucible and heated in the temperature range of 303–1273 K at a heating
rate of 20 K·min−1.
Temperature programmed desorption of ammonia (NH3-TPD) exper-
iments were performed in a system consisted of a quartz microreactor, a
well-controlled tubular furnace and a gas chromatograph with the ther-
mal conductivity detector (TCD). A 100 mg sample was preheated in He
at 873 K for 2 h and then equilibrated with NH3 at room temperature.
Physisorbed NH3 was removed by purging with He at 373 K for 2 h. The
TPD measurement was conducted by heating the sample from 373 to
873 K at 10 K·min−1 in helium (30 cm3·min−1).
The catalytic properties of mesoporous oxides were investigated in
the dehydrogenation of propane in the presence of CO2 (DHP-CO2).
This process was carried out in a ﬂow-type quartz reactor packed with
200 mg of the catalyst (grain size 0.2–0.3 mm) in the temperature
range of 773–873 K and under atmospheric pressure. The gaseous reac-
tion mixture consisted of C3H8:CO2:He=1:5:9 (molar ratio), and the
total ﬂow rate was 30 cm3·min−1. The products and unreacted sub-
strates were analyzed using an Agilent 6890N gas chromatograph
(equipped with Hayesep Q and 13× molecular sieves packed columns
and thermal conductivity detector), connected on-line to the reactor
outlet. The conversion of propane, yield of propene and selectivity to
products were calculated as described elsewhere [20].
In the selected case the prepared sample stability was investigated
in the consecutive dehydrogenation, regeneration and puriﬁcation
cycles. DHP-CO2 tests were carried out for 240 min at 823 K, other re-
action conditions were the same as described above. After each dehy-
drogenation cycle the catalyst was regenerated shortly for 15 min
with air at 823 K (Vair=30 cm3·min−1) and then puriﬁed with
helium at 823 K for 5 min (VHe=30 cm3·min−1).
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Characterization of materials
Fig. 1 displays the XRD patterns of pure SBA-15, CMK-3 as well as
Ga2O3–m and Ga2O3–Al2O3 mixed oxides with Ga:Al atomic ratios of
4:1 and 1:4 obtained by nanoreplication. In the 2θ range of 0.5–6.0°
SBA-15 shows three diffraction lines indexed to the (100), (110)
and (200) reﬂection characteristic for a 2D hexagonal phase (space
group p6mm) [23]. The negative replica of SBA-15 (CMK-3) exhibits
one intensive (100) reﬂection and two very weak and broad reﬂec-
tions, all of them are slightly shifted towards higher 2 theta values

compared to SBA-15. Pure Ga2O3–m and the Ga2O3–Al2O3 samples
show one intensive (100) reﬂection and in some cases two signiﬁ-
cantly weaker (110) and (200) ones (visible after magniﬁcation)
indicating that hexagonal pore rearrangement of the initial hard tem-
plate (SBA-15) is remained after repeated templating.
SEM and TEM images of SBA-15, CMK-3 and Ga2O3–m samples are
presented in Fig. 2. Pure SBA-15 consists of wheat-like aggregates
with rope-like domains characterized by a uniform size of about 1 μm.
Its negative replica, CMK-3, and pure Ga2O3–m have very similar shapes
and a slightly lower size of particles that suggests that after replications
the morphology of the initial rigid template (SBA-15) is preserved. TEM
imaging (Fig. 2G–I) conﬁrms that SBA-15 and CMK-3 materials have a
uniform pore structure. It should be noticed that Ga2O3–m possesses a
mesoporous structure, however, with less regular long-range structural
order.
The N2-physisorption isotherms of SBA-15 and their negative carbon
replica, CMK-3 are shown in Fig. 3A. According to the IUPAC classiﬁcation
the isotherms are a type IV with a steep increase around P/P0=0.4 in the
case of CMK-3 and above 0.5 for the Ga-containing mesoporous
materials.
The pore size distributions calculated with the BJH method evi-
dence that all obtained materials have a uniform pore size in the
mesoporous range. Pure SBA-15 has very narrow pore size distribu-
tion with the pronounced peak at 8.2 nm, while its negative replica
CMK-3 shows a less uniform pore-size centered at 4.3 nm. The pore
sizes in mesoporous Ga2O3–m and Ga2O3–Al2O3 obtained by repeated
templating are in the range between those for SBA-15 and its nega-
tive replica, CMK-3. The maxima in the pore size distributions can
be found in the range between 6.2 to 6.5 nm for these materials
that is in good agreement with the results reported recently for
pure mesoporous Ga2O3 (6.3 nm) obtained with a similar method
using GaCl3 solution in toluene [8]. Moreover, the fact that the pore

sizes in mesoporous Ga2O3 and Ga2O3–Al2O3 are lower than in
SBA-15 can be explained by the structural shrinkage process. It is
most likely that the carbon framework formed during carbonization
of sucrose contracted and the empty distance between the pores'
wall and carbon rods appeared (supplement, Fig. 1S). In result, both
the wall thickness of CMK-3 (h=5.2 nm) and pore sizes of the
mesoporous materials after repeated templating are lower compared
to the pore size of SBA-15 applied as the initial hard template.
The textural properties of the studied materials as well as chemi-
cal and phase composition are summarized in Table 1.
All samples obtained by nanocasting have lower SBET than that of
SBA-15. Similarly, total pore volumes and average pore diameters of
the replicas are lower compared to SBA-15 that is in consistence
with the results reported in literature for various mesoporous metal
oxides (e.g. MgO, In2O3, ZrO2, Ga2O3 and Al2O3) obtained using
CMK-3 as the hard template [8,21,24,25]. Moreover, in the group of
the investigated materials SBET and Vtotal decrease gradually with
the increase of Ga content. The mentioned above changes in the
textural properties correlate with the density of bulk oxides. In the
case of the investigated materials the density increases in the order:
Si>Al>Ga, therefore the SBET and Vtotal of SBA-15 are higher than
that of all nanoreplicas and for the Ga-containing samples the textural
parameters decrease with the increase in the Ga content.

823 K. Fig. 4 displays the variation of propane conversion and propene
selectivity with time-on-stream over all prepared mesoporous oxides
and the reference Ga2O3-t sample.
The highest initial conversion of propane was achieved for the
Ga2O3-t sample. However, this material rapidly lost its activity and
after 250 min on stream it was almost inactive. These results are in
good agreement with the previous reports which show fast deactiva-
tion of disordered Ga2O3 due to coke deposition [14,15,17]. Over
Ga2O3–m and Ga2O3–Al2O3(Ga/Al=4/1) materials the initial conver-
sion of propane was slightly lower in comparison with Ga2O3-t, but
during the DHP-CO2 process the mesoporous materials deactivated
more slowly than Ga2O3-t. In result, mesoporous oxides exhibited higher
conversion of propane compared to Ga2O3-t after 30 min-on-stream. The
lowest propane conversion was observed over the Ga2O3–Al2O3(Ga/Al=
1/4) sample with the lowest Ga atomic ratio. However, over Ga2O3–
Al2O3(Ga/Al=1/4) the conversion of propane was unchanged during
4 h of the process. Similar correlation between catalytic performance in
DHP-CO2 and the Ga/Al composition has been reported by Chen et al.
[17] for spinel-type Ga2O3–Al2O3 mixed oxides.
It has been proposed that the high catalytic performance of pure
Ga2O3 and mixed Ga2O3–Al2O3 materials is attributed to the surface
gallium sites with a relatively weak acidity [17,18]. Our NH3-TPD
measurements conﬁrm that weak-medium acid sites dominate on
the surface of the investigated materials. The TPD proﬁles of all mate-
rials show one broad desorption peak with the maximum at about
467 K (supplement Fig. 2S). Table 2 summarizes the quantitative cal-
culation of desorbed ammonia normalized to SBET (acid site density).
The coke amounts estimated based on TG analysis and initial yield of
propene obtained at 823 K are reported as well.
The acid site density of the investigated materials varies parallelly
with the initial yield of propene conﬁrming that weak acid sites play
important role in the dehydrogenation of light alkanes. Moreover,
with raising the density of acid sites and initial yield of propene the
amount of coke deposited during DHP-CO2 process increases. Such a
relation between the deactivation and coke amount can be explained
in terms of the substrate–product reactivity. Several recent investiga-
tions concerning dehydrogenations of hydrocarbons with CO2 indi-
cate that the coke is produced more intensively from unsaturated
hydrocarbons than from saturated ones [26,27]. Therefore, with in-
crease of propane conversion to more reactive propene, intensiﬁca-
tion of coking during DHP-CO2 is observed. We cannot exclude that
lower coke amount deposited on the samples containing Al is due
to generation of new – Al–O–Ga – sites as was proposed in literature
[17,18]. However, our NH3-TPD results did not show signiﬁcant differ-
ence in the acid site strength between pure Ga2O3 and Ga2O3–Al2O3
nanoreplicas.
During 4 h of process over mesoporous oxides, propene was
obtained with slightly higher selectivity than over the reference
Ga2O3-t sample. For example, in the presence of mesoporous Ga2O3–m
the selectivity to propene was 91–95%, while over Ga2O3-t; which has
identical chemical composition; the selectivity was 85–92%. It has
been found that in DHP-CO2 process over the Ga-containing materials
the selectivity to propene depends on two factors. The ﬁrst factor is as-
sociated with the acidity which is determined either by the phase com-
position of Ga2O3 or by the properties of the support [13,15,16,19]. For
example, over α- and β-Ga2O3 polymorphs propene was obtained
with a higher selectivity in DHP-CO2 than over δ- and γ-Ga2O3 [15].
The second factor is pore geometry which is important especially in
the case of highly porous Ga-containing materials [19]. Since the XRD
measurements prove that both Ga2O3–m and Ga2O3-t have identical
phase compositions (Table 1 and supplement Fig. 3S) we suspect that
higher selectivity to propene over Ga2O3–m is probably caused by its
uniform mesopore structure with the higher order of pore size distribu-
tion. It is most likely that mesoporosity facilitates the dehydrogenation
reaction due to the rapid diffusion of the products in the available
space of the biggest pores preventing against side reactions, which
could decrease the selectivity to propene. However, such explanation
needs further more careful investigation concerning the relationship
between kinetics of the DHP-CO2 and pore structure of nanoreplicas.
Table 3 summarizes the catalytic results obtained after 10 min-
on-stream over Ga2O3–m at three different temperatures.
Propene is the primary product formed at all the studied tempera-
tures. In addition, light hydrocarbons (methane, ethane and ethene) as
well as small amounts of aromatic hydrocarbons (benzene and toluene)
are produced. The selectivity to the side products rises with temperature
indicating that hydrocracking, cracking and dehydrocyclization reac-
tions are more privileged at high temperatures. With increasing reaction
temperature the amount of coke estimated on the basis of TG analysis
rises as well (the last column in Table 3) suggesting that in the
dehydrogenation of propane in the presence of CO2 the reaction of
Boudouard (Ccoke+CO2=2CO) does not suppress coke deposition.

Finally, the stability of Ga2O3–m was investigated. Fig. 5A displays
the variation of propene yield vs. time-on-stream in four consecutive
dehydrogenation cycles at 823 K.
In each cycle, the yield of propene gradually decreases due to
coking. However, after short regeneration with air the mesoporous
Ga2O3–m almost completely recovers its catalytic performance.
Moreover, comparison of the initial propene yield in each cycle
shows that it drops only slightly. This suggests a high stability of
Ga2O3–m under the operation conditions. The structural characteriza-
tion of regenerated Ga2O3–m after the last dehydrogenation cycle
reveals only small changes. A clear XRD (100) reﬂection (Fig. 5B)
and narrow mesopore distributions (inset to Fig. 5C) conﬁrm that
the hexagonal pore structure was not changed considerably during
the catalytic process.
4. Conclusions
Nanocasting was applied for the preparation of thermally stable
mesoporous Ga2O3 and Ga2O3-Al2O3 oxides with large speciﬁc surface
areas (231–322 m2·g−1), uniform mesopores in the 3–14 nm range
and pore architecture similar to that of SBA-15 (hexagonal structure).
Pure mesoporous Ga2O3–m and mixed Ga–Al–O(Al/Ga=1:4) exhibit
a promising catalytic performance in the dehydrogenation of propane
to propene in the presence of CO2. Under the reaction conditions
Ga2O3–m exerts high structure stability and higher resistance to deac-
tivation in comparison with the Ga2O3-t material obtained without a
hard template.
