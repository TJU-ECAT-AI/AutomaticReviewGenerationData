A novel approach is described for preparing Ga-promoted Pt particles for the dehydrogenation of light
alkanes to alkenes. The modifying element, Ga, was introduced by transference from the support, a cal-
cined Mg(Ga)(Al)O hydrotalcite-like material. Pt nanoparticles were dispersed onto the calcined
Mg(Ga)(Al)O starting from an organometallic precursor, followed by reduction. The formation of PtGa
alloy particles is dependent on reduction temperature. Reduction at 723 K produces mainly metallic Pt
particles. The average diameter of the Pt nanoparticles increased from 1.4 nm to 2.2 nm with increasing
Ga content, and decreasing Al content of the support, demonstrating the importance of support Al atoms
in stabilizing the dispersion of Pt. After reduction at 773–873 K, PtGa alloys were observed. It is proposed
that at high reduction temperatures, H atoms formed on the surface of the metal particles spill over onto
the support where they reduce Ga3+ cation to atomic Ga, which then interacts with the supported Pt to
form PtGa alloys. The activity, selectivity and stability of Pt/Mg(Ga)(Al)O catalysts for ethane and propane
dehydrogenation are described in the second part of this study (G. Siddiqi, P. Sun, V. Galvita, A.T. Bell,

1. Introduction
Light alkenes, such as ethylene, propylene, and n-butene, are
widely used as building blocks for the production of commodity
chemical and polymers. Rising demand for light alkenes has ex-
ceeded the capacity for the production of these products by petro-
leum cracking, the current principal source, motivating an interest
for seeking other means for producing intermediates. The catalytic
dehydrogenation of ethane, propane, and butane offers an attrac-
tive alternative source, since the starting materials are inexpen-
sive. A further attraction of alkane dehydrogenation is that
hydrogen, the principal byproduct, is a valuable commodity that
can readily be used for many purposes within a petroleum reﬁnery,
e.g., hydrocracking and heteroatom removal.
Platinum is known as an active catalyst for the dehydrogenation
of light alkanes, but in the absence of modiﬁers suffers from low
alkene selectivity and deactivation due to rapid coke formation. Al-
kene selectivity can be increased, and the tendency to form coke
decreased by promoting Pt with elements, such as Sn, Zn, Ge, Pb,
and Re [1–6]. The means by which the promoting element interacts
with Pt and inﬂuences its catalytic properties are best understood
for Sn. EXAFS [7–9], Mossbauer [10–12], and TEM [13–15] studies
of supported SnPt catalysts suggest that Sn forms a variety of bime-
tallic alloys, which enhance the dissociative adsorption of the
reacting alkane and attenuate the adsorption of the product alkene
[16–28]. The ﬁrst of these effects increases the rate of alkene for-
mation, whereas the latter reduces the loss of hydrogen from the
readsorbed alkene, a process that leads to the formation of lower
molecular weight products and coke [29,30]. The composition of
the support used for Pt bimetallic catalysts inﬂuences the stability
of the metal particles to sintering and the formation of coke on the
support itself. Previous studies have shown that the formation of
coke is minimized using non-acidic supports such as K–L zeolite,
alkali-doped alumina, spinels, and calcined hydrotalcite [Mg(Al)O]
[31–36]. Of these supports, Mg(Al)O is particularly attractive be-
cause it is moderately basic and exhibits high thermal stability to
steam and reaction–oxidation cycling [37,38].
In a recent study [39], we have shown that PtSn/Mg(Al)O is a
highly active and selective catalyst for the dehydrogenation of eth-
ane to ethene. The support was produced by calcining a hydrotac-
lite-like precursor prepared with an Mg/Al ratio of 5. The BET area
of the calcined support was 200 m2/g. Pt nanoparticles were depos-
ited by impregnation of the support with a toluene solution of
Pt(acetylacetonate)2, drying, and H2 reduction. To achieve intimate
contact between the Sn precursor and the Pt particles, reduced Pt/
Mg(Al)O was reacted with tetrabutyl tin and then reduced in H2.
The highest dehydrogenation activity was obtained with a Sn/Pt ra-
tio of 0.3, whereas 100% ethene selectivity was achieved for a Sn/Pt
ratio of 0.4, with only a small loss in dehydrogenation activity.

A further attraction of hydrotalcite-derived supports is that
they can be prepared with elements other than Al, e.g., Zn, Ga, In.
We have recently exploited this characteristic by preparing and
evaluating a series of Pt/Mg(Ga)(Al)O catalysts for the dehydroge-
nation of ethane and propane. This paper focuses on the synthesis
and characterization of these catalysts, whereas the second one fo-
cuses on the evaluation of these catalysts for ethane and propane
dehydrogenation [40].
2. Experimental
2.1. Catalyst synthesis
Mg(Ga)(Al)O was synthesized using the following procedure:
58.31 g of Mg(NO3)26H2O (Alfa Aesar, 98–102%), an appropriate
amount (depending on the desired Ga/Al ratio) of Al(NO3)39H2O
(Alfa
Aesar,
98–102%)
and
an
appropriate
amount
of
Ga(-
NO3)3xH2O (Alfa Aesar, 99.9%) were dissolved in 250 ml of deion-
ized water, and 1.2 g of Na2CO3 (EMD Chemicals Inc., 99.5%) and
11 g of NaOH (Fisher Scientiﬁc, 98.3%) were dissolved in 250 ml
of deionized water. These two solutions were mixed by dropwise
addition over a period of about 20 min in a stirred vessel main-
tained at about 333 K, afterward the mixture was taken out of
water bath then aged at RT for 18 h. The aged solution was then ﬁl-
tered, and the solid product dried overnight in air at 383 K. The
dried material was heated in air to 973 K at 2 K/min and main-
tained at this temperature for 10 h to obtain the ﬁnal support,
which we describe as Mg(Ga)(Al)O. Pure Mg(Ga)O and Mg(Al)O
were prepared in a similar manner.
Pt was dispersed onto the calcined support via grafting.
Twenty-one milligrams of Pt(acetylacetonate)2 (Sigma Aldrich,
99.99%) was dissolved in 1.5 ml toluene. This solution was then
poured onto 1 g of freshly calcined support. The resulting slurry
mixture was stirred until it became powdery, then left at room
temperature in air for 2 h, and ﬁnally dried overnight at 383 K in
an oven. After drying, the catalyst was reduced at 723 K for 2 h
(5 K/min temperature ramp) in 10% H2/Ar (60 cm3/min), referred
to as the as-prepared catalyst.
2.2. Catalyst characterization
The Pt, Mg, Al, Ga contents of all samples were determined by
Galbraith Laboratories (Knoxville, TN) by inductively coupled plas-
ma
optical
emission
spectroscopy.
The
surface
area
of
Pt/
Mg(Ga)(Al)O was determined by the multi-point method using
an Autosorb-1 instrument (Quantachrome Corporation, Boynton
Beach, FL). Prior to measuring the adsorption isotherm, each sam-
ple was degassed under vacuum at 573 K for 22–24 h. The struc-
ture of the support material was characterized by X-ray powder
diffraction before and after calcination, using a Siemens Diffrac-
tometer D 5000 with CuKa radiation (k = 1.5418 Å) at 20 kV and
5 mA. The samples were scanned from 2h values of 5 to 70 with
a step size of 0.02 and a dwell time of 1.0 s.
Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and differential scanning cal-
orimeter (DSC) were used to characterize the transformations
occurring during calcination of the dried support. These measure-
ments were performed with a TA Instrument, SDT 2960 Simulta-
neous
DSC-TGA.
About
20 mg
of
the
dried,
as-synthesized
support was placed in an alumina crucible and heated from 403
to 1173 K in ﬂowing nitrogen (100 cm3/min) at a rate of 10 K/min.
Magic angle spinning (MAS) 71Ga NMR spectra were acquired
on a Bruker Avance 500 MHz NMR spectrometer equipped with a
broadband, double resonance, magic angle spinning (MAS) probe
tuned to 152.55 MHz. Samples were spun at frequencies between
7 and 12 kHz in zirconia rotors of 4 mm outer diameter and
80 lL sample volume. 71Ga spectra were obtained using a solid
echo sequence ((p/2)  s  (p/2)) with a 90 pulse of 4.5 ls and s
value of 18 ls. A recycle delay of 0.1 s and scans up to 400,000
were used. The spectra were referenced using 1 M Ga(NO3)3 at
0 ppm.
The dispersion of Pt was determined by H2 chemisorption using
a AutoChem II 2920 (Micromeritics Instrument Corporation).
About 60 mg of Pt/Mg(Ga)(Al)O was loaded into a quartz cell and
then reduced in ﬂowing 10% H2/Ar (50 cm3/min). The temperature
of the sample was raised at 5 K/min to 873 K and then maintained
at this level for 2 h. The sample was then ﬂushed in ﬂowing Ar for
90 min and then cooled down to 318 K. The uptake of chemisorbed
hydrogen was then measured by determining the uptake of H2
from pulses using a TCD detector. The pulse size was 50 cm3/g
and the time between pulses was 10 min.
Pt LIII edge EXAFS data were obtained at the Stanford Synchro-
tron Radiation Laboratory (SSRL) using Beamline 4-1. As-prepared
catalyst samples (reduced at 723 K after Pt(acac)2 deposition) were
pressed into wafers and then placed into a stainless steel cell in
which the sample could be heated or cooled in the presence of
ﬂowing gas. EXAFS data of as-prepared catalysts were acquired
with He ﬂowing through the cell at 60 cm3/min. To acquire the ac-
tive metallic particle information under reaction state, the sample
was reduced in 10% H2/Ar (500 C for Pt/Mg(Ga)(Al)O Ga/Pt = 5.4
and 873 K for Pt/Mg(Ga)(Al)O Ga/Pt = 12) for 2 h with ﬂowing rate
of 60 cm3/min and heating rate of 10 K/min. The sample was then
cooled to liquid nitrogen temperature and maintained at that tem-
perature for all measurements. Background removal, normaliza-
tion and other data processing were done using ‘‘Athena”, and
the ﬁtting of theoretical standards to the experimental data was
done using ‘‘Artemis” [41,42]. Theoretical standards were con-
structed using known crystal structures of PtGa alloys, as well as
Pt oxides [43,44].
The structure of the support was examined using a FEI Tecnai
12 transmission electron microscope. Samples were prepared by
placing a small amount (<10 mg) of sample in ethanol and sonicat-
ing for 15 min. The mixture was then added via a dropper onto a
holey carbon-coated grid deposited on a 200-mesh copper screen
(S.P.I. Supplies) and allowed to dry in air.
STEM-EDX analyses were conducted by Evans Analytical Group
(Sunnyvale, CA) using a FEI Tecnai TF-20XT FEGTEM equipped with
a 30 mm 2 INCA EDS detector. The STEM operated at 200 kV accel-
eration potential. High Angle Annular Dark Field-Scanning Trans-
mission
Electron

(HAADF-STEM)
images
were
acquired from the catalyst nanoparticles. The nominal electron
probe size was about 1.5 nm in diameter. The samples had been
supported on a lacey carbon support ﬁlm on copper mesh grid.
Point and areal EDS spectra were obtained for the energy range
of 0–20 keV.
3. Results and discussion
A list of all samples studied is presented in Table 1. The Mg/
(Al + Ga) ratio was maintained close to 5 for the majority of the
samples, as the Al/Ga ratio was varied from 0 to 1. The Pt content
was maintained between 0.7 wt% and 0.8 wt%, which means that
the bulk Ga/Pt ratio was varied from 0 to 96.
Fig. 1 shows the XRD pattern of the dried, as-synthesized sup-
port (bottom) and the same material after calcination (top). Prior
to calcination, the XRD pattern is characteristic of the layered dou-
ble hydroxide structure of hydrotalcite [45]. After calcination at
973 K, the structure of the solid changes from orthorhombic to a
cubic, corresponding to the transformation of a two-dimensional
layered structure to a three-dimensional structure, analogous to
periclase MgO. The broad peaks of both materials are indicative

193
of small crystalline particles or a partially amorphous phase. Sim-
ilar changes in the XRD patterns were observed for all support
materials, independent of the Al/Ga ratio.
Fig. 2 shows the thermogravimetric analysis-differential scan-
ning calorimetry (TGA-DSC) curve of the dried, as-prepared sup-
port containing 3.22 wt% Ga (Al/Ga = 6), whereas Fig. 3 shows the
TGA-DSC curve of the dried support containing 28.3 wt% Ga (Al/
Ga = 0). The two materials exhibit similar TGA-DSC patterns. Two
endothermic peaks are observed, one below 573 K, corresponding
to the release of interlayer water, and the other between 573 K
and 873 K, corresponding to dehydroxylation and carbonate
decomposition [46–48]. With increasing Ga content, the ﬁrst peak
shifts to higher temperatures, while the second peak shifts to lower
temperatures. A small endothermic peak starting at 1173 K was
also observed, which may correspond to the formation of a dense
spinel phase [49]. A loss in sample weight was observed up to
973 K, and as a result, this temperature was chosen as the upper
limit needed to obtain a dry, high surface area support without
inducing the transition to a dense spinel phase.
The TGA measurements revealed that the endothermic peaks
shifted with increasing Ga content. The ﬁrst peak shifted to a high-
er temperature, indicating that the Ga-containing material holds
water more tightly, and the second peak shifted to lower temper-
atures, indicating that the presence of Ga facilitates the decompo-
sition of the hydrotalcite to mixed oxides. The latter change is very
likely due to the more random layer stacking of Mg–Ga type hydro-
talcites compared to Mg–Al type hydrotalcites [45].
Table 2 lists the surface areas of the calcined mixed oxide mate-
rials. Mg(Al)O has a surface area of 176 m2/g and a pore volume of
0.6 cm3/g. The addition of Ga to the hydrotalcite-like precursor
material caused a small decrease in the surface area of the calcined
support as well as the pore volume. While not shown, the surface
area and pore volume changed minimally upon the dispersion of Pt
onto the support.
The local order of Ga atoms in Pt/Mg(Ga)(Al)O was probed by
71Ga NMR. Fig. 4 shows the 71Ga NMR spectra of three samples
containing Pt loading of about 0.8 wt%, but with different Ga/Pt ra-
tios. Spectrum A (Ga/Pt = 5.4) exhibits peaks at 32.1 and 12.1 ppm,
characteristic of Ga in octahedral coordination. The presence of
two peaks is due to two types of octahedrally coordinated Ga, dif-
fering in the presence of Mg or Mg and Al in the second nearest-
neighbor coordination sphere [50]. As seen in spectrum B, increas-
ing the Ga/Pt ratio to 12 had no detectable effect on the 71Ga NMR
spectrum. However, further increasing the Ga/Pt ratio to 96 (spec-
trum C) resulted in the occurrence of additional peaks at 58.2 ppm
and 201.1 ppm, characteristic of Ga cations with ﬁve- and fourfold
coordination [51–53], suggesting that at high Ga/Pt ratios, the
coordination of Ga changes. EXAFS studies probe into the local
ordering Ga atoms in calcined hydrotalcites Mg(Ga)O by Bellotto
et al. [45] have shown that for Mg/Ga ratios greater than 3, the
four-coordinated Ga atoms may be due to formation of spinel
structure, whereas ﬁve-coordinated Ga may be due to unsaturated

surface formed species by dehydroxylation upon calcinations.
Thus, the appearance of four- and ﬁvefold coordinated Ga in Pt/
Mg(Ga)(Al)O-96 is attributed to restructuring of the support.
The dispersion of the Pt particles on calcined hydrotalcite-like
supports, determined by H2 chemisorption, is presented in Table 2.
Pt supported on Mg(Al)O has a dispersion of 84%, corresponding to
an average particle size of 1.35 nm. The dispersion of Pt on
Mg(Ga)(Al)O tended to decrease with increasing Ga/Pt ratio from
about 78% to 52%, corresponding to an increase in average Pt par-
ticle size from 1.5 to 2.2 nm. The observed decrease in Pt disper-
sion with increasing Ga/Pt ratio is very likely due to the decrease
in the concentration of Al cations at the surface of the support,
which have been observed to facilitate the dispersion of Pt [54].
A TEM image of Pt/Mg(Ga)(Al)O-5.4 is shown in Fig. 5. After cal-
cination, the support still exhibited a layered structure, similar to
that seen earlier for Mg(Al)O [55]. Small Pt particles about 1–
2 nm in diameter are also seen. Lattice images of these small par-
ticles can be seen in the high-resolution micrograph shown as an
inset in Fig. 5. The sizes of these particles are consistent with the
average particle size deduced from H2 chemisorption.
Evidence for the interactions of Ga with Pt was obtained from
EXAFS. Pt LIII edge EXAFS data were acquired for as-prepared Pt/
Mg(Ga)(Al)O Ga/Pt = 5.4 and Pt/Mg(Ga)(Al)O Ga/Pt = 12, reduced
in H2 at 723 K, and following reduction of 773 K (Pt/Mg(Ga)(Al)O
Ga/Pt = 5.4) and 873 K (Pt/Mg(Ga)(Al)O Ga/Pt = 12). The results
are shown in Figs. 6 and 7. Analysis of the EXAFS pattern of as-pre-
pared Pt/Mg(Ga)(Al)O Ga/Pt = 5.4 gives Pt–Pt (dPt–Pt = 2.77 Å) and
Pt–O
(dPt–O = 2.05 Å)
coordination
numbers
of
4.4 ± 0.6
and
1.1 ± 0.2, respectively. A similar analyses for Pt/Mg(Ga)(Al)O Ga/
Pt = 12 gives a Pt–Pt (dPt–Pt = 2.77 Å) and Pt–O (dPt–O = 2.03 Å) coor-
dination numbers of 3.9 ± 0.6 and 1.2 ± 0.2, respectively. Thus, EX-
AFS analysis suggests that after reduction at 723 K, platinum is
present as a mixture of Pt and PtOx.
The EXAFS pattern acquired after the reduction of Pt/Mg(Ga)(A-
l)O-5.4 at 873 K is shown in Fig. 8. A good ﬁt of the pattern could be
obtained using EXAFS parameters for pure Pt and PtGa. By this

means, the Pt–Pt coordination (dPt–Pt = 2.79 Å) was found to be

of
8.14 ± 0.85. An even larger change in the EXAFS pattern was ob-
served when as-prepared Pt/Mg(Ga)(Al)O-12 was reduced in H2
at 873 K, in Fig. 9. In this case, the Pt–Pt coordination (dPt–
Pt = 2.75 Å) was found to be 5.2 ± 1.0 and the Pt–Ga coordination
(dPt–Ga = 2.58 Å) was found to be 3.6 ± 2.4, giving a total Pt coordi-
nation of 8.8 ± 3.3. The higher Pt–Ga coordination number for the
sample with Ga/Pt = 12 indicates that an increase in the reduction
temperature leads to a greater degree of association of Ga with Pt.
It is also possible that the metal nanoparticles in Pt/Mg(Ga)(Al)O-
12 are richer in Ga than those in sample with a Ga/Pt = 5.4 because
of higher concentration of Ga in the bulk of the former catalyst. The
close similarity in the total coordination number for Pt in both
samples indicates that the particle sizes in the two samples are
similar, in agreement with what was found by H2 chemisorption.

Mg(Ga)(Al)O-5.4 and Pt/Mg(Ga)(Al)O-12 reduced at 723 K and
873 K are shown in Fig. 10. Virtually, no change in the patterns is
observed either with Ga/Pt ratio or temperature of reduction, indi-
cating that most of the Ga remains in the support and that migra-
tion of only a small amount of Ga to the Pt is responsible for the
signiﬁcant change in Pt–Ga backscattering seen in Pt LIII edge EX-
AFS patterns.
Additional evidence for the formation of PtGa alloys was ob-
tained from EDX analysis of the samples. EDX was conducted on
larger particles of Pt/Mg(Ga)(Al)O-5.4 and of Pt/Mg(Ga)(Al)O-12
after reduction at 723 K and 873 K. In areas of the support free of
Pt particles, the Ga/Mg ratio measure after sample reduction at
723 K was for 1.37 ± 0.23  102 for Pt/Mg(Ga)(Al)O-5.4 and
2.28 ± 0.5.1  102 for Pt/Mg(Ga)(Al)O-12 in good agreement with
the bulk stoichiometric values of 1.39  102 and 2.65  102,
respectively. Figs. 11 and 12 show the distribution of Ga/Pt ratios
for of the metal particles characterized by EDX after reduction of
Pt/Mg(Ga)(Al)O-5.4 and Pt/Mg(Ga)(Al)O-12 at 723 K. It is evident
that for both samples, most of the Pt is unassociated with Ga,
and only a small to modest fraction of the particles exhibit Ga/Pt
ratios in the range of 0.01–0.10. A signiﬁcant change was observed,
though, after reduction at 873 K. In this case, Figs. 11 and 12 show
that the Ga/Pt ratio of the Pt particles rises to between 0.1 and 0.59
for Pt/Mg(Ga)(Al)O-5.4 and between 0.1 and 1.09 for Pt/Mg(Ga)(A-
l)O-12. Thus, the average Ga/Pt ratio of the metal particles is larger,
the larger the bulk value of Ga/Pt. It is signiﬁcant that ICP analysis
of Pt/Mg(Ga)(Al)O-10 (a duplicate of Pt/Mg(Ga)(Al)O-12) before
and after reduction at 873 K gave Ga/Mg ratios of 2.78  102
and 2.69  102. The difference in Ga/Mg rations is well within er-
ror range of ICP analysis, and, therefore, it is concluded that H2
reduction at 873 K does not result in a loss of Ga from the catalyst.

reduction at 873 K suggests that the individual metal particles of
the Ga/Pt ratios vary from one to another.
The data acquired in this study suggest that upon reduction of
Pt/Mg(Ga)(Al)O at temperatures above 773 K, a portion of the
Ga3+ near the surface of the support is reduced to Ga atoms which
then migrate and diffuse into the supported Pt nanoparticles,
thereby forming PtGa alloys of varying composition. This interpre-
tation is fully consistent with earlier studies of PtGa alloy forma-
tion on Pt/Ga2O3 and Pt/Al2O3/Ga2O3 [56,57]. TEM and STEM
have also been used previously to infer the presence of PtGa alloys
on Pt/Ga-ZSM-5, but the stoichiometry of the phases present was
not determined [58]. In all cases, the presence of Pt is essential
to enable the reduction of Ga3+. Thus, it has been reported that
Ga3+ in GaCl3/MgF2 could only be reduced at very high tempera-
ture, such as 1050 K [59]. However, the addition of Pt to this sys-
tem lowered the temperature at which Ga3+ could be reduced to
713 K. A similar observation, that the reduction temperature of
Ga3+ decreased by Pt presence, has been made for PtGa/Al2O3
[60], Pt/Al2O3/Ga2O3 [61], and Pt/H[Ga]ZSM-5 and Pt–Ga/H-ZSM-
5 [61–69].
Therefore,
we
propose
that
during
the
reduction
of
Pt/
Mg(Ga)(Al)O at elevated temperatures, H atoms formed on the sur-
face of Pt particles spill over onto the support and initiate the
reduction of Ga3+ cation to Ga atoms, which then interact with
the supported Pt nanoparticles to GaPt alloys. Catalyst character-
ization by ICP, 71Ga NMR, and Ga EXAFS suggest that only a small
part of the total Ga in the support is consumed in this process and
that most of the Ga3+ cations remain octahedrally coordinated in
the support. The overall mechanism is proposed in Fig. 13.
4. Conclusion
A new method is reported for preparing PtGa bimetallic parti-
cles supported on a calcined, hydrotalcite-like support, Mg(Ga)(A-
l)O. Ga NMR spectra of the calcined support indicate that Ga3+
cations are present primarily in octahedral coordination. With
increasing Ga/(Ga + Al) ratio, the support surface area decreases
progressively and the size of the dispersed Pt particles increases,
reﬂecting the need for Al atoms at the support surface in order to
anchor the dispersed Pt. Information obtained from NMR, STEM-
EDX, and Pt LIII edge EXAFS suggest that after reduction at 723 K,
majority of the platinum is present in Pt and PtOx particles ranging
in size from 1.4 to 2.2 nm. The size of the supported particles in-
creased from an average of 1.2 nm to 2.2 nm as the Ga/(Ga + Al) ra-
tio increased from 0 to 1. Upon H2 reduction of Pt/Mg(Ga)(Al)O at
773–873 K, a portion of the Ga3+ cations near the surface are re-
duced to Ga atoms by H atoms spilled over from the supported
Pt particles, leading to the formation of PtGa alloys ranging in
Ga/Pt ratio from 0.1 to 1.1.
