[1] "While supported chromium oxide and supported Pt are typically used as catalysts to perform this reaction in commercial processes [1,2], only few studies have been carried out using vanadium-containing catalysts [36]."

[2] "Notwithstanding the strong influence of the support on the physicochemical nature of VOx species, it appears that one of the key variables in controlling the performance of VOx catalysts is the nature of the oxide carrier."

[3] "Regarding the various candidates VOx supported catalysts for n-butane dehydrogenation, both redox and acidbase properties are studied here. Characterization of these catalysts is carried out using temperature programmed reduction and oxidation (TPR and TPO) and ammonia temperature programmed desorption (NH3-TPD)."

[4] "It was noticed that the specific surface area of the support was unaffected upon the introduction of VOx for both  and  alumina. In contrast with this, a strong decrease of the specific surface area was observed for the USY supported catalyst, with the BET area being reduced by nearly 50% after vanadium impregnation."

[5] "Taking this into account, the H2 consumption peak in the b profile of Fig. 1, corresponding to VOx/-Al2O3 catalysts, is assigned to VOx chains or bi-dimensional species reduction, while the lower temperature shoulder is postulated as the result of the reduction of mono or divandates species."

The exploration of vanadium oxide-based catalysts as alternatives to Pt and CrOx for paraffin dehydrogenation has been driven by the need to find more efficient and cost-effective catalysts. Research in this area has evolved since the 1980s, with relatively few studies focusing on vanadium-containing catalysts compared to the more commonly used chromium oxide and platinum catalysts.

The nature and behavior of vanadium species in these catalysts are strongly influenced by several variables:

1. Carrier type: The nature of the oxide carrier is a key variable in controlling the performance of VOx catalysts. Different supports can lead to the formation of various vanadium species, such as mono or dimeric vanadates, VOx chains, vanadia overlayers, or V2O5 crystallites.

2. Support surface area: The surface area of the support can affect the dispersion of vanadium species. For example, the study observed that the introduction of VOx had different effects on the specific surface area of various supports, with alumina remaining unaffected while USY showed a significant decrease in surface area.

3. Metal loading: The amount of vanadium loaded onto the support can influence the types of vanadium species formed. At low loadings, monomeric or dimeric vanadates may be prevalent, while higher loadings can lead to the formation of polyvanadates chains or even supported monolayers.

4. Redox and acid-base properties: These properties are crucial in determining the catalyst's performance and are studied using techniques such as temperature-programmed reduction and oxidation (TPR and TPO) and ammonia temperature-programmed desorption (NH3-TPD).

The research has shown that the interplay between these variables can lead to the formation of different vanadium species with varying catalytic properties, highlighting the complexity and potential of vanadium oxide-based catalysts for paraffin dehydrogenation.

作为铂和氧化铬催化剂的替代品，钒氧化物基催化剂的探索主要是由寻找更高效和更具成本效益的催化剂的需求所驱动的。自20世纪80年代以来，这一领域的研究不断发展，但与更常用的氧化铬和铂催化剂相比，关注钒含有催化剂的研究相对较少。

这些催化剂中钒物种的性质和行为受到几个变量的强烈影响：

1. 载体类型：氧化物载体的性质是控制VOx催化剂性能的关键变量。不同的载体可以导致形成各种钒物种，如单体或二聚体钒酸盐、VOx链、钒氧化物覆盖层或V2O5晶体。

2. 载体表面积：载体的表面积可以影响钒物种的分散度。例如，研究观察到VOx的引入对不同载体的比表面积有不同的影响，氧化铝保持不变，而USY的表面积显著降低。

3. 金属负载量：负载到载体上的钒量可以影响形成的钒物种类型。在低负载量时，可能以单体或二聚体钒酸盐为主，而高负载量可能导致多钒酸盐链甚至支持的单层的形成。

4. 氧化还原和酸碱性质：这些性质对决定催化剂的性能至关重要，通过温度程序还原和氧化（TPR和TPO）以及氨气程序升温脱附（NH3-TPD）等技术进行研究。

研究表明，这些变量之间的相互作用可以导致具有不同催化性能的钒物种的形成，突出了钒氧化物基催化剂在烷烃脱氢中的复杂性和潜力。
