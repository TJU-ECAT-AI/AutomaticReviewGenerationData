[1] "While supported chromium oxide and supported Pt are typically used as catalysts to perform this reaction in commercial processes [1,2], only few studies have been carried out using vanadium-containing catalysts [36]."

[2] "Notwithstanding the strong influence of the support on the physicochemical nature of VOx species, it appears that one of the key variables in controlling the performance of VOx catalysts is the nature of the oxide carrier."

[3] "Regarding the various candidates VOx supported catalysts for n-butane dehydrogenation, both redox and acidbase properties are studied here. Characterization of these catalysts is carried out using temperature programmed reduction and oxidation (TPR and TPO) and ammonia temperature programmed desorption (NH3-TPD)."

[4] "It can thus, be appreciated that a VOx theoretical partial coverage of the supports is obtained for all the catalysts, except for VOxM/-Al2O3. In the latter case, the amount of VOx exceeds the monolayer capacity of the support and this suggests the presence of V2O5 crystallites or a vanadia over layer on this catalyst sample."

The exploration of vanadium oxide-based catalysts as alternatives to Pt and CrOx for paraffin dehydrogenation has been driven by the need to find new catalytic materials for this important industrial reaction. Research in this area has evolved since the 1980s, but progress has been limited, with only a few studies carried out on vanadium-containing catalysts compared to the more established Pt and CrOx systems.

The nature and behavior of vanadium species in these catalysts are strongly influenced by several variables:

1. Carrier type: The nature of the oxide carrier is a key variable in controlling the performance of VOx catalysts. Different supports can lead to the formation of different vanadium species.

2. Support surface area: This affects the dispersion and coverage of vanadium species. Higher surface area supports generally allow for better dispersion of active sites.

3. Metal loading: The amount of vanadium loaded onto the support influences the nature of vanadium species formed. At low loadings, isolated or small clusters of vanadium oxide may form, while at higher loadings, crystalline V2O5 or vanadia overlayers may develop.

These factors affect the redox and acid-base properties of the catalysts, which are crucial for their performance in paraffin dehydrogenation. Characterization techniques such as TPR, TPO, and NH3-TPD are used to study these properties and understand the nature of the active sites.

作为烷烃脱氢反应Pt和CrOx催化剂的替代品,钒氧化物基催化剂的探索主要是由于需要寻找新的催化材料来进行这一重要的工业反应。自20世纪80年代以来,这一领域的研究一直在进行,但进展有限,与更为成熟的Pt和CrOx体系相比,对钒含有催化剂的研究还比较少。

这些催化剂中钒物种的性质和行为受到几个变量的强烈影响:

1. 载体类型:氧化物载体的性质是控制VOx催化剂性能的关键变量。不同的载体可能导致不同钒物种的形成。

2. 载体表面积:这影响钒物种的分散和覆盖程度。通常,高比表面积的载体允许活性位更好地分散。

3. 金属负载量:负载到载体上的钒数量影响形成的钒物种的性质。在低负载量时,可能形成孤立或小簇的钒氧化物,而在高负载量时,可能发展成晶态V2O5或钒氧化物覆盖层。

这些因素影响催化剂的氧化还原和酸碱性质,这些性质对烷烃脱氢性能至关重要。采用TPR、TPO和NH3-TPD等表征技术来研究这些性质,并了解活性位的本质。

While supported chromium oxide and supported Pt are typically used as catalysts to perform this reaction in commercial processes [1,2], only few studies have been carried out using vanadium-containing catalysts [36]."

[2] "Notwithstanding the strong influence of the support on the physicochemical nature of VOx species, it appears that one of the key variables in controlling the performance of VOx catalysts is the nature of the oxide carrier."

[3] "Catalytic activity tests were performed in a fixed bed micro-reactor with a mass of catalyst in the 0.070.25 g range. The weight of the catalyst sample was selected to keep in all cases a close to constant amount of vanadium, set at 4 mg."

[4] "It was noticed that the specific surface area of the support was unaffected upon the introduction of VOx for both  and  alumina. In contrast with this, a strong decrease of the specific surface area was observed for the USY supported catalyst, with the BET area being reduced by nearly 50% after vanadium impregnation."

The exploration of vanadium oxide-based catalysts as alternatives to Pt and CrOx for paraffin dehydrogenation has been driven by the need to produce alkenes from low-cost saturated hydrocarbons. Research in this area has been limited, with only a few studies carried out on vanadium-containing catalysts since the 1980s.

The nature of the oxide carrier (support) has been identified as a key variable in controlling the performance of VOx catalysts. Different supports, such as alumina and zeolites, have been investigated. The type of carrier influences the physicochemical nature of VOx species on the catalyst surface.

Variables such as support surface area and metal loading have been found to affect the nature and behavior of vanadium species in these catalysts. For example, the introduction of VOx on alumina supports did not significantly affect the specific surface area, while for USY zeolite supports, a strong decrease in surface area was observed after vanadium impregnation.

The metal loading has been controlled in some studies by adjusting the catalyst sample weight to maintain a constant amount of vanadium. This approach allows for a more direct comparison of the effects of different supports on catalyst performance.

Overall, research has shown that the interplay between the vanadium species and the support material is crucial in determining the catalyst's activity and selectivity for paraffin dehydrogenation reactions.

作为铂和氧化铬催化剂在烷烃脱氢反应中的替代品，钒氧化物基催化剂的探索主要是为了从低成本饱和烃原料中生产烯烃。自20世纪80年代以来，这一领域的研究仍然有限，只有少数几项关于含钒催化剂的研究。

氧化物载体（支撑材料）的性质被认为是控制VOx催化剂性能的关键变量之一。研究人员已经考察了不同的支撑材料，如氧化铝和沸石。载体类型影响着催化剂表面VOx物种的物理化学性质。

支撑材料表面积和金属负载量等变量被发现会影响这些催化剂中钒物种的性质和行为。例如，在氧化铝支撑材料上引入VOx并不会显著影响比表面积，而对于USY沸石支撑材料，钒浸渍后观察到比表面积显著降低。

在一些研究中，通过调整催化剂样品重量来控制金属负载量，以保持恒定的钒含量。这种方法允许更直接地比较不同支撑材料对催化剂性能的影响。

总的来说，研究表明，钒物种与支撑材料之间的相互作用对于确定催化剂在烷烃脱氢反应中的活性和选择性至关重要。

The exploration of vanadium oxide-based catalysts as alternatives to Pt and CrOx for paraffin dehydrogenation has been driven by the need to find more efficient and cost-effective catalysts. Research in this area has evolved since the 1980s, with relatively few studies focusing on vanadium-containing catalysts compared to the more commonly used chromium oxide and platinum catalysts.

The nature and behavior of vanadium species in these catalysts are strongly influenced by several variables:

1. Carrier type: The nature of the oxide carrier is a key variable in controlling the performance of VOx catalysts. Different supports can lead to the formation of various vanadium species, such as mono or dimeric vanadates, VOx chains, vanadia overlayers, or V2O5 crystallites.

2. Support surface area: The surface area of the support can affect the dispersion of vanadium species. For example, the study observed that the introduction of VOx had different effects on the specific surface area of various supports, with alumina remaining unaffected while USY showed a significant decrease in surface area.

3. Metal loading: The amount of vanadium loaded onto the support can influence the types of vanadium species formed. At low loadings, monomeric or dimeric vanadates may be prevalent, while higher loadings can lead to the formation of polyvanadates chains or even supported monolayers.

4. Redox and acid-base properties: These properties are crucial in determining the catalyst's performance and are studied using techniques such as temperature-programmed reduction and oxidation (TPR and TPO) and ammonia temperature-programmed desorption (NH3-TPD).

The research has shown that the interplay between these variables can lead to the formation of different vanadium species with varying catalytic properties, highlighting the complexity and potential of vanadium oxide-based catalysts for paraffin dehydrogenation.
