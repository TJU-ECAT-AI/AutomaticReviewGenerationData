[1] "Dehydrogenation of light alkanes in oxygen free atmospheres is a valuable approach to produce alkenes from feedstocks of low-cost saturated hydrocarbons. While supported chromium oxide and supported Pt are typically used as catalysts to perform this reaction in commercial processes [1,2], only few studies have been carried out using vanadium-containing catalysts [36]."

[2] "Notwithstanding the strong influence of the support on the physicochemical nature of VOx species, it appears that one of the key variables in controlling the performance of VOx catalysts is the nature of the oxide carrier."

[3] "Catalytic activity tests were performed in a fixed bed micro-reactor with a mass of catalyst in the 0.070.25 g range. The weight of the catalyst sample was selected to keep in all cases a close to constant amount of vanadium, set at 4 mg."

[4] "It was noticed that the specific surface area of the support was unaffected upon the introduction of VOx for both  and  alumina. In contrast with this, a strong decrease of the specific surface area was observed for the USY supported catalyst, with the BET area being reduced by nearly 50% after vanadium impregnation."

The exploration of vanadium oxide-based catalysts as alternatives to Pt and CrOx for paraffin dehydrogenation has been driven by the need to produce alkenes from low-cost saturated hydrocarbons. Research in this area has been limited, with only a few studies carried out on vanadium-containing catalysts since the 1980s.

The nature of the oxide carrier (support) has been identified as a key variable in controlling the performance of VOx catalysts. Different supports, such as alumina and zeolites, have been investigated. The type of carrier influences the physicochemical nature of VOx species on the catalyst surface.

Variables such as support surface area and metal loading have been found to affect the nature and behavior of vanadium species in these catalysts. For example, the introduction of VOx on alumina supports did not significantly affect the specific surface area, while for USY zeolite supports, a strong decrease in surface area was observed after vanadium impregnation.

The metal loading has been controlled in some studies by adjusting the catalyst sample weight to maintain a constant amount of vanadium. This approach allows for a more direct comparison of the effects of different supports on catalyst performance.

Overall, research has shown that the interplay between the vanadium species and the support material is crucial in determining the catalyst's activity and selectivity for paraffin dehydrogenation reactions.

作为铂和氧化铬催化剂在烷烃脱氢反应中的替代品，钒氧化物基催化剂的探索主要是为了从低成本饱和烃原料中生产烯烃。自20世纪80年代以来，这一领域的研究仍然有限，只有少数几项关于含钒催化剂的研究。

氧化物载体（支撑材料）的性质被认为是控制VOx催化剂性能的关键变量之一。研究人员已经考察了不同的支撑材料，如氧化铝和沸石。载体类型影响着催化剂表面VOx物种的物理化学性质。

支撑材料表面积和金属负载量等变量被发现会影响这些催化剂中钒物种的性质和行为。例如，在氧化铝支撑材料上引入VOx并不会显著影响比表面积，而对于USY沸石支撑材料，钒浸渍后观察到比表面积显著降低。

在一些研究中，通过调整催化剂样品重量来控制金属负载量，以保持恒定的钒含量。这种方法允许更直接地比较不同支撑材料对催化剂性能的影响。

总的来说，研究表明，钒物种与支撑材料之间的相互作用对于确定催化剂在烷烃脱氢反应中的活性和选择性至关重要。
