[1] "Dehydrogenation of light alkanes in oxygen free atmospheres is a valuable approach to produce alkenes from feedstocks of low-cost saturated hydrocarbons. While supported chromium oxide and supported Pt are typically used as catalysts to perform this reaction in commercial processes [1,2], only few studies have been carried out using vanadium-containing catalysts [36]."

[2] "Notwithstanding the strong influence of the support on the physicochemical nature of VOx species, it appears that one of the key variables in controlling the performance of VOx catalysts is the nature of the oxide carrier."

[3] "Catalytic activity tests were performed in a fixed bed micro-reactor with a mass of catalyst in the 0.070.25 g range. The weight of the catalyst sample was selected to keep in all cases a close to constant amount of vanadium, set at 4 mg."

[4] "It can thus, be appreciated that a VOx theoretical partial coverage of the supports is obtained for all the catalysts, except for VOxM/-Al2O3. In the latter case, the amount of VOx exceeds the monolayer capacity of the support and this suggests the presence of V2O5 crystallites or a vanadia over layer on this catalyst sample."

The exploration of vanadium oxide-based catalysts as alternatives to Pt and CrOx for paraffin dehydrogenation has been driven by the desire to produce alkenes from low-cost saturated hydrocarbons in oxygen-free atmospheres. Research in this area has been limited, with only a few studies on vanadium-containing catalysts conducted since the 1980s.

The nature and behavior of vanadium species in these catalysts are strongly influenced by several variables:

1. Carrier type: The nature of the oxide carrier is a key variable in controlling the performance of VOx catalysts. Different supports can lead to varying physicochemical properties of the VOx species.

2. Support surface area: This affects the dispersion and coverage of vanadium species on the support. Higher surface area supports generally allow for better dispersion of active species.

3. Metal loading: The amount of vanadium loaded onto the support influences the nature of the vanadium species formed. At lower loadings, monolayer or sub-monolayer coverage is typically achieved, while higher loadings can lead to the formation of V2O5 crystallites or vanadia overlayers.

These factors collectively determine the structure and properties of the vanadium species on the support, which in turn affect the catalyst's activity, selectivity, and stability in paraffin dehydrogenation reactions. The research has evolved to focus on optimizing these parameters to develop more efficient and selective vanadium oxide-based catalysts for alkane dehydrogenation.

作为铂和氧化铬催化剂的替代品，钒氧化物基催化剂在烷烃脱氢领域的探索主要是由于在无氧环境下从低成本饱和烃原料生产烯烃的需求驱动的。自1980年代以来，这一领域的研究有限，只有少数关于含钒催化剂的研究。

这些催化剂中钒物种的性质和行为受到几个变量的强烈影响：

1. 载体类型：氧化物载体的性质是控制VOx催化剂性能的关键变量。不同的载体可以导致VOx物种具有不同的物理化学性质。

2. 载体表面积：这影响钒物种在载体上的分散和覆盖情况。通常，高表面积载体允许活性物种更好地分散。

3. 金属负载量：负载到载体上的钒数量影响形成的钒物种的性质。在较低负载量时，通常实现单层或亚单层覆盖，而较高负载量可能导致V2O5晶体或钒氧化物覆盖层的形成。

这些因素共同决定了载体上钒物种的结构和性质，进而影响催化剂在烷烃脱氢反应中的活性、选择性和稳定性。研究已经演变为关注优化这些参数，以开发更高效、更具选择性的钒氧化物基催化剂用于烷烃脱氢。
