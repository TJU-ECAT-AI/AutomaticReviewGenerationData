[1] "While supported chromium oxide and supported Pt are typically used as catalysts to perform this reaction in commercial processes [1,2], only few studies have been carried out using vanadium-containing catalysts [36]."

[2] "Notwithstanding the strong influence of the support on the physicochemical nature of VOx species, it appears that one of the key variables in controlling the performance of VOx catalysts is the nature of the oxide carrier."

[3] "Regarding the various candidates VOx supported catalysts for n-butane dehydrogenation, both redox and acidbase properties are studied here. Characterization of these catalysts is carried out using temperature programmed reduction and oxidation (TPR and TPO) and ammonia temperature programmed desorption (NH3-TPD)."

[4] "It can thus, be appreciated that a VOx theoretical partial coverage of the supports is obtained for all the catalysts, except for VOxM/-Al2O3. In the latter case, the amount of VOx exceeds the monolayer capacity of the support and this suggests the presence of V2O5 crystallites or a vanadia over layer on this catalyst sample."

The exploration of vanadium oxide-based catalysts as alternatives to Pt and CrOx for paraffin dehydrogenation has been driven by the need to find new catalytic materials for this important industrial reaction. Research in this area has evolved since the 1980s, but progress has been limited, with only a few studies carried out on vanadium-containing catalysts compared to the more established Pt and CrOx systems.

The nature and behavior of vanadium species in these catalysts are strongly influenced by several variables:

1. Carrier type: The nature of the oxide carrier is a key variable in controlling the performance of VOx catalysts. Different supports can lead to the formation of different vanadium species.

2. Support surface area: This affects the dispersion and coverage of vanadium species. Higher surface area supports generally allow for better dispersion of active sites.

3. Metal loading: The amount of vanadium loaded onto the support influences the nature of vanadium species formed. At low loadings, isolated or small clusters of vanadium oxide may form, while at higher loadings, crystalline V2O5 or vanadia overlayers may develop.

These factors affect the redox and acid-base properties of the catalysts, which are crucial for their performance in paraffin dehydrogenation. Characterization techniques such as TPR, TPO, and NH3-TPD are used to study these properties and understand the nature of the active sites.

作为烷烃脱氢反应Pt和CrOx催化剂的替代品,钒氧化物基催化剂的探索主要是由于需要寻找新的催化材料来进行这一重要的工业反应。自20世纪80年代以来,这一领域的研究一直在进行,但进展有限,与更为成熟的Pt和CrOx体系相比,对钒含有催化剂的研究还比较少。

这些催化剂中钒物种的性质和行为受到几个变量的强烈影响:

1. 载体类型:氧化物载体的性质是控制VOx催化剂性能的关键变量。不同的载体可能导致不同钒物种的形成。

2. 载体表面积:这影响钒物种的分散和覆盖程度。通常,高比表面积的载体允许活性位更好地分散。

3. 金属负载量:负载到载体上的钒数量影响形成的钒物种的性质。在低负载量时,可能形成孤立或小簇的钒氧化物,而在高负载量时,可能发展成晶态V2O5或钒氧化物覆盖层。

这些因素影响催化剂的氧化还原和酸碱性质,这些性质对烷烃脱氢性能至关重要。采用TPR、TPO和NH3-TPD等表征技术来研究这些性质,并了解活性位的本质。
