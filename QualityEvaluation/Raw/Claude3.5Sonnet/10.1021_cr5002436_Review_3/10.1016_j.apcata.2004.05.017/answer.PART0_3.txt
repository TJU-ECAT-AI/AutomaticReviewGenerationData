[1] "Dehydrogenation of light alkanes in oxygen free atmospheres is a valuable approach to produce alkenes from feedstocks of low-cost saturated hydrocarbons. While supported chromium oxide and supported Pt are typically used as catalysts to perform this reaction in commercial processes [1,2], only few studies have been carried out using vanadium-containing catalysts [36]."

[2] "Notwithstanding the strong influence of the support on the physicochemical nature of VOx species, it appears that one of the key variables in controlling the performance of VOx catalysts is the nature of the oxide carrier."

[3] "Catalytic activity tests were performed in a fixed bed micro-reactor with a mass of catalyst in the 0.070.25 g range. The weight of the catalyst sample was selected to keep in all cases a close to constant amount of vanadium, set at 4 mg."

[4] "It can thus, be appreciated that a VOx theoretical partial coverage of the supports is obtained for all the catalysts, except for VOxM/-Al2O3. In the latter case, the amount of VOx exceeds the monolayer capacity of the support and this suggests the presence of V2O5 crystallites or a vanadia over layer on this catalyst sample."

The exploration of vanadium oxide-based catalysts as alternatives to Pt and CrOx for paraffin dehydrogenation has been driven by the need to find more cost-effective and efficient catalysts for producing alkenes from low-cost saturated hydrocarbons. Research in this area has evolved since the 1980s, with only a few studies focusing on vanadium-containing catalysts compared to the more commonly used supported chromium oxide and supported Pt catalysts.

The nature and behavior of vanadium species in these catalysts are influenced by several variables:

1. Carrier type: The nature of the oxide carrier is a key variable in controlling the performance of VOx catalysts. Different supports can lead to varying physicochemical properties of the VOx species.

2. Support surface area: This affects the dispersion and coverage of vanadium oxide on the support. Higher surface area supports generally allow for better dispersion of active species.

3. Metal loading: The amount of vanadium loaded onto the support influences the nature of the vanadium species formed. At lower loadings, monomeric or dimeric vanadates may form, while higher loadings can lead to polyvanadates chains or even V2O5 crystallites.

4. Preparation method: Different preparation techniques can result in varying degrees of vanadium dispersion and interaction with the support.

These factors collectively determine the nature of the vanadium species (e.g., isolated species, chains, monolayers, or crystallites) and their interaction with the support, which in turn affects the catalyst's activity, selectivity, and stability in paraffin dehydrogenation reactions.

作为铂和氧化铬催化剂的替代品，钒氧化物基催化剂在烷烃脱氢反应中的探索主要是由寻找更具成本效益和高效的催化剂来生产低成本饱和烃的烯烃的需求所驱动的。自20世纪80年代以来，这一领域的研究有所发展，但与更常用的负载型氧化铬和负载型铂催化剂相比，只有少数研究专注于含钒催化剂。

这些催化剂中钒物种的性质和行为受到几个变量的影响：

1. 载体类型：氧化物载体的性质是控制VOx催化剂性能的关键变量。不同的载体可能导致VOx物种具有不同的物理化学性质。

2. 载体比表面积：这影响钒氧化物在载体上的分散和覆盖程度。通常，比表面积较高的载体允许活性物种更好地分散。

3. 金属负载量：负载到载体上的钒量影响形成的钒物种的性质。在较低的负载量下，可能形成单体或二聚体钒酸盐，而较高的负载量可能导致多钒酸盐链，甚至是V2O5晶体。

4. 制备方法：不同的制备技术可能导致钒的分散程度和与载体的相互作用不同。

这些因素共同决定了钒物种的性质（例如，孤立物种、链状、单层或晶体）及其与载体的相互作用，进而影响催化剂在烷烃脱氢反应中的活性、选择性和稳定性。
