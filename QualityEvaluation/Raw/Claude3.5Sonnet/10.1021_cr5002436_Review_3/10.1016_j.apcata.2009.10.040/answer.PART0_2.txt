The given literature does not contain any information about vanadium oxide-based catalysts for paraffin dehydrogenation. The text primarily discusses palladium and gallium-based catalysts for n-butane dehydrogenation. There is no mention of vanadium oxide catalysts or their development since the 1980s. The document also does not discuss variables like carrier type, support surface area, or metal loading in relation to vanadium species. Therefore, this question cannot be answered based on the provided literature.
