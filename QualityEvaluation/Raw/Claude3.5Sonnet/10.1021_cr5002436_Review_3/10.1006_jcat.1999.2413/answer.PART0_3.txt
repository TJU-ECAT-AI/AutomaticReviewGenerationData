The given literature does not contain any information about vanadium oxide-based catalysts for paraffin dehydrogenation. The document focuses on molybdenum oxide catalysts for n-butane dehydrogenation, and does not discuss vanadium catalysts or their development since the 1980s. There is no mention of how variables like carrier type, support surface area, or metal loading influence vanadium species in these catalysts. The question cannot be answered based on the information provided in this document.
