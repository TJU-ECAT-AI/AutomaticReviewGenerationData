          [1] "Supported vanadium oxides have been widely used as catalysts for a number of reactions. The molecular structure of the surface vanadium oxide species and the catalytic properties are influenced by the method of preparation, the nature of support, promotors and environmental conditions"

[2] "Vanadia species dispersed on alumina offer a broad range of VOx structures [3] and show a high activity and selectivity for the production of alkenes from the corresponding alkanes"

[3] "Different techniques like XRD, Raman spectroscopy, solid-state NMR, ESR, TPR, FT-IR and UVvis diffuse reflectance spectra (DRS) have been applied to characterize the structure of vanadium species on the surface of alumina"

[4] "Depending on the vanadium loadings, different vanadium oxide species (V5+) were formed on the surface of alumina after calcination. Mainly isolated and polymerized VO4 units were observed at coverages up to a monolayer while VO6 octahedra were predominant on catalyst surfaces at higher vanadium loadings"

[5] "Nature of vanadium species on alumina depends not only on vanadium loadings but also on calcination temperature."

[6] "After calcination of V(4.5 wt.%)/Al2O3 at 873 K dispersed isolated and polymerized V5+ species in tetrahedral coordination dominate, with the later being the main species. With increasing vanadium loadings up to 13.2 wt.% the portion of dispersed VOx species decreased and the portion of vanadium present in a crystalline AlVO4 phase increased."

[7] "The catalytic activity for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane is determined by the amount of dispersed isolated and polymerised tetrahedrally coordinated V5+ species."

[8] "Propene selectivity depends on the dispersion of the tetrahedrally coordinated V5+ species; the higher the dispersion, the higher the propene selectivity."

[9] "Most of the studies mentioned above were carried out with catalytic material calcined up to 823 K. The oxidative dehydrogenation of propane is a strong exothermic reaction and maximum temperatures of about 873 K or higher were observed in the catalytic bed using a more concentrated feed"

          The exploration of vanadium oxide-based catalysts as alternatives for paraffin dehydrogenation has been driven by several factors:

1. Versatility: Supported vanadium oxides have been widely used as catalysts for various reactions.

2. Tunability: The molecular structure and catalytic properties of surface vanadium oxide species can be influenced by preparation methods, support nature, promoters, and environmental conditions.

3. Performance: Vanadia species dispersed on alumina demonstrate high activity and selectivity for alkene production from alkanes.

Research in this area has evolved since the 1980s through the application of various characterization techniques such as XRD, Raman spectroscopy, solid-state NMR, ESR, TPR, FT-IR, and UV-vis DRS. These methods have allowed for detailed analysis of vanadium species structure on alumina surfaces.

Variables influencing the nature and behavior of vanadium species in these catalysts include:

1. Carrier type: Alumina has been found to offer a broad range of VOx structures and show high activity and selectivity for alkene production.

2. Metal loading: Different vanadium oxide species form on the alumina surface depending on vanadium loadings. At lower coverages, isolated and polymerized VO4 units predominate, while at higher loadings, VO6 octahedra become more prevalent.

3. Calcination temperature: The nature of vanadium species on alumina is influenced by both vanadium loadings and calcination temperature. Most earlier studies used materials calcined up to 823 K, but higher temperatures (around 873 K or above) have been explored due to the exothermic nature of propane oxidative dehydrogenation.

4. Support surface area: While not explicitly discussed, it is implied that this factor affects the dispersion of vanadium species, which in turn influences catalytic activity and selectivity.

The research has revealed that dispersed isolated and polymerized V5+ species in tetrahedral coordination are the most active for propane dehydrogenation. Higher dispersion of these species leads to better propene selectivity. The study of these variables has allowed researchers to optimize catalyst composition and preparation methods for improved performance in paraffin dehydrogenation reactions.

          作为烷烃脱氢反应替代催化剂，钒氧化物基催化剂的研究主要由以下因素推动：

1. 多功能性：负载型钒氧化物已被广泛用作多种反应的催化剂。

2. 可调性：表面钒氧化物物种的分子结构和催化性能可以通过制备方法、载体性质、助剂和环境条件来调控。

3. 性能：分散在氧化铝上的钒物种对烷烃生成烯烃表现出高活性和选择性。

自20世纪80年代以来，该领域的研究通过应用各种表征技术如XRD、拉曼光谱、固态NMR、ESR、TPR、FT-IR和UV-vis DRS而不断发展。这些方法允许对氧化铝表面钒物种结构进行详细分析。

影响这些催化剂中钒物种性质和行为的变量包括：

1. 载体类型：氧化铝被发现可以提供广泛的VOx结构，并在烯烃生产中表现出高活性和选择性。

2. 金属负载量：根据钒负载量的不同，氧化铝表面会形成不同的钒氧化物物种。在较低覆盖率下，以孤立和聚合的VO4单元为主，而在较高负载量下，VO6八面体变得更为普遍。

3. 焙烧温度：氧化铝上钒物种的性质受钒负载量和焙烧温度的双重影响。早期大多数研究使用焙烧温度不超过823 K的材料，但由于丙烷氧化脱氢反应的放热性质，已探索了更高的温度（约873 K或更高）。

4. 载体表面积：虽然没有明确讨论，但暗示这个因素影响钒物种的分散，进而影响催化活性和选择性。

研究表明，分散的孤立和聚合的四面体配位V5+物种对丙烷脱氢最为活跃。这些物种的分散度越高，丙烯的选择性就越好。对这些变量的研究使研究人员能够优化催化剂组成和制备方法，以改善烷烃脱氢反应的性能。
