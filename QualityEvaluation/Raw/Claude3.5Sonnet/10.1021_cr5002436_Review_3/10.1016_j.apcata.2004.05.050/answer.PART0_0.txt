[1] "Supported vanadium oxides have been widely used as catalysts for a number of reactions. The molecular structure of the surface vanadium oxide species and the catalytic properties are influenced by the method of preparation, the nature of support, promotors and environmental conditions"

[2] "Vanadia species dispersed on alumina offer a broad range of VOx structures [3] and show a high activity and selectivity for the production of alkenes from the corresponding alkanes"

[3] "Nature of vanadium species on alumina depends not only on vanadium loadings but also on calcination temperature."

[4] "After calcination of V(4.5 wt.%)/Al2O3 at 873 K dispersed isolated and polymerized V5+ species in tetrahedral coordination dominate, with the later being the main species. With increasing vanadium loadings up to 13.2 wt.% the portion of dispersed VOx species decreased and the portion of vanadium present in a crystalline AlVO4 phase increased."

[5] "The catalytic activity for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane is determined by the amount of dispersed isolated and polymerised tetrahedrally coordinated V5+ species."

[6] "Propene selectivity depends on the dispersion of the tetrahedrally coordinated V5+ species; the higher the dispersion, the higher the propene selectivity."

The exploration of vanadium oxide-based catalysts as alternatives for paraffin dehydrogenation has been driven by their broad range of VOx structures and high activity and selectivity for alkene production. Research in this area has evolved to focus on understanding how various factors influence the nature and behavior of vanadium species in these catalysts.

Key variables that influence vanadium species include:

1. Carrier type: Different supports like alumina affect the molecular structure of surface vanadium oxide species.

2. Support surface area: This impacts the dispersion of vanadium species, which in turn affects catalytic activity and selectivity.

3. Metal loading: Increasing vanadium loadings changes the distribution of vanadium species, with higher loadings leading to more crystalline phases like AlVO4.

4. Calcination temperature: This significantly affects the nature of vanadium species formed on the support.

The research has revealed that dispersed isolated and polymerized V5+ species in tetrahedral coordination are the most active for propane dehydrogenation. Higher dispersion of these species leads to better propene selectivity. The study of these variables has allowed researchers to optimize catalyst composition and preparation methods for improved performance in paraffin dehydrogenation reactions.

作为烷烃脱氢反应替代催化剂，钒氧化物基催化剂的研究主要由其广泛的VOx结构和对烯烃生产的高活性和选择性驱动。该领域的研究已经发展到关注各种因素如何影响这些催化剂中钒物种的性质和行为。

影响钒物种的关键变量包括：

1. 载体类型：不同的载体（如氧化铝）会影响表面钒氧化物物种的分子结构。

2. 载体表面积：这影响钒物种的分散度，进而影响催化活性和选择性。

3. 金属负载量：增加钒负载量会改变钒物种的分布，更高的负载量会导致更多晶态相（如AlVO4）的形成。

4. 焙烧温度：这显著影响载体上形成的钒物种的性质。

研究表明，四面体配位的分散孤立和聚合V5+物种对丙烷脱氢反应最为活跃。这些物种的分散度越高，丙烯的选择性就越好。对这些变量的研究使研究人员能够优化催化剂组成和制备方法，以改善烷烃脱氢反应的性能。
