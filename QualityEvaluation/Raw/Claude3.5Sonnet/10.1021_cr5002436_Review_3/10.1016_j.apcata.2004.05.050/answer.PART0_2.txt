[1] "Supported vanadium oxides have been widely used as catalysts for a number of reactions. The molecular structure of the surface vanadium oxide species and the catalytic properties are influenced by the method of preparation, the nature of support, promotors and environmental conditions"

[2] "Vanadia species dispersed on alumina offer a broad range of VOx structures [3] and show a high activity and selectivity for the production of alkenes from the corresponding alkanes"

[3] "Different techniques like XRD, Raman spectroscopy, solid-state NMR, ESR, TPR, FT-IR and UVvis diffuse reflectance spectra (DRS) have been applied to characterize the structure of vanadium species on the surface of alumina"

[4] "Depending on the vanadium loadings, different vanadium oxide species (V5+) were formed on the surface of alumina after calcination."

[5] "Most of the studies mentioned above were carried out with catalytic material calcined up to 823 K. The oxidative dehydrogenation of propane is a strong exothermic reaction and maximum temperatures of about 873 K or higher were observed in the catalytic bed using a more concentrated feed"

The exploration of vanadium oxide-based catalysts as alternatives for paraffin dehydrogenation has been driven by several factors:

1. Versatility: Supported vanadium oxides have shown wide applicability as catalysts for various reactions.

2. Tunability: The molecular structure and catalytic properties of surface vanadium oxide species can be influenced by preparation methods, support nature, promoters, and environmental conditions.

3. Performance: Vanadia species dispersed on alumina demonstrate high activity and selectivity for alkene production from alkanes.

Research in this area has evolved since the 1980s through the application of various characterization techniques such as XRD, Raman spectroscopy, solid-state NMR, ESR, TPR, FT-IR, and UV-vis DRS. These methods have allowed for detailed analysis of vanadium species structure on alumina surfaces.

Variables influencing the nature and behavior of vanadium species in these catalysts include:

1. Vanadium loading: Different vanadium oxide species form on the alumina surface depending on the amount of vanadium present.

2. Calcination temperature: Most earlier studies used materials calcined up to 823 K, but higher temperatures (around 873 K or above) have been explored due to the exothermic nature of propane oxidative dehydrogenation.

3. Support characteristics: The nature of the support material affects the dispersion and structure of vanadium oxide species.

While the document does not explicitly discuss carrier type and support surface area, it implies that these factors, along with metal loading, play crucial roles in determining the properties and performance of vanadium oxide catalysts.

作为烷烃脱氢反应替代铂和氧化铬催化剂的钒氧化物基催化剂的研究受到以下因素的推动：

1. 多功能性：负载型钒氧化物已被广泛用作多种反应的催化剂。

2. 可调性：表面钒氧化物物种的分子结构和催化性能可以通过制备方法、载体性质、助剂和环境条件来调控。

3. 性能：分散在氧化铝上的钒物种对烷烃生成烯烃表现出高活性和选择性。

自20世纪80年代以来，该领域的研究通过应用各种表征技术如XRD、拉曼光谱、固态NMR、ESR、TPR、FT-IR和UV-vis DRS而不断发展。这些方法允许对氧化铝表面钒物种结构进行详细分析。

影响这些催化剂中钒物种性质和行为的变量包括：

1. 钒负载量：根据存在的钒含量，在氧化铝表面形成不同的钒氧化物物种。

2. 焙烧温度：早期大多数研究使用焙烧温度不超过823 K的材料，但由于丙烷氧化脱氢反应的放热性质，已探索了更高的温度（约873 K或更高）。

3. 载体特性：载体材料的性质影响钒氧化物物种的分散和结构。

虽然文献没有明确讨论载体类型和载体表面积，但暗示这些因素以及金属负载量在决定钒氧化物催化剂的性能和表现方面起着关键作用。
