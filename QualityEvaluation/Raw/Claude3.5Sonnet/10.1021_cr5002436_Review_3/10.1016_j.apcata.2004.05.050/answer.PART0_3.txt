[1] "Supported vanadium oxides have been widely used as catalysts for a number of reactions. The molecular structure of the surface vanadium oxide species and the catalytic properties are influenced by the method of preparation, the nature of support, promotors and environmental conditions"

[2] "Vanadia species dispersed on alumina offer a broad range of VOx structures [3] and show a high activity and selectivity for the production of alkenes from the corresponding alkanes [4]."

[3] "Depending on the vanadium loadings, different vanadium oxide species (V5+) were formed on the surface of alumina after calcination. Mainly isolated and polymerized VO4 units were observed at coverages up to a monolayer [1,5,13] while VO6 octahedra were predominant on catalyst surfaces at higher vanadium loadings [1]."

[4] "Nature of vanadium species on alumina depends not only on vanadium loadings but also on calcination temperature."

The exploration of vanadium oxide-based catalysts as alternatives for paraffin dehydrogenation has been driven by their wide applicability as catalysts for various reactions. Research in this area has evolved to focus on understanding how preparation methods, support materials, promoters, and environmental conditions influence the molecular structure and catalytic properties of surface vanadium oxide species.

Variables such as carrier type, support surface area, and metal loading significantly influence the nature and behavior of vanadium species in these catalysts. Specifically:

1. Carrier type: Alumina has been found to offer a broad range of VOx structures and show high activity and selectivity for alkene production.

2. Metal loading: Different vanadium oxide species form on the alumina surface depending on vanadium loadings. At lower coverages, isolated and polymerized VO4 units predominate, while at higher loadings, VO6 octahedra become more prevalent.

3. Calcination temperature: The nature of vanadium species on alumina is influenced by both vanadium loadings and calcination temperature.

These factors collectively determine the molecular structure, dispersion, and catalytic behavior of vanadium species in the catalysts, which in turn affect their performance in paraffin dehydrogenation reactions.

钒氧化物基催化剂作为烷烃脱氢反应替代品的研究主要源于其在多种反应中的广泛应用。这一领域的研究已经演变为关注制备方法、载体材料、助剂和环境条件如何影响表面钒氧化物物种的分子结构和催化性能。

载体类型、载体表面积和金属负载量等变量显著影响这些催化剂中钒物种的性质和行为。具体来说：

1. 载体类型：氧化铝被发现可以提供广泛的VOx结构，并在烯烃生产中表现出高活性和选择性。

2. 金属负载量：根据钒负载量的不同，氧化铝表面会形成不同的钒氧化物物种。在较低覆盖率下，以孤立和聚合的VO4单元为主，而在较高负载量下，VO6八面体变得更为普遍。

3. 煅烧温度：氧化铝上钒物种的性质受钒负载量和煅烧温度的双重影响。

这些因素共同决定了催化剂中钒物种的分子结构、分散度和催化行为，进而影响其在烷烃脱氢反应中的性能。
