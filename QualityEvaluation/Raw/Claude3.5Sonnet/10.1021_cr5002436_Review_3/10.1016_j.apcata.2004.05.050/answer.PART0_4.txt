The given scientific literature does not directly address the factors that have driven the exploration of vanadium oxide-based catalysts as alternatives to Pt and CrOx for paraffin dehydrogenation, nor does it discuss how research in this area has evolved since the 1980s. The document focuses specifically on the characterization and catalytic performance of vanadium oxide species supported on alumina for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane, rather than providing a broader historical context or comparison to other catalyst types.

However, the literature does provide some insights into how variables such as metal loading and calcination temperature influence the nature and behavior of vanadium species in these catalysts. The study shows that increasing vanadium loadings (from 4.5 to 13.2 wt%) and calcination temperature (from 773 to 973 K) affect the coordination, dispersion, and phase composition of vanadium species on the alumina support. These factors in turn influence the catalytic activity and selectivity for propane dehydrogenation.

The research demonstrates that isolated and polymerized tetrahedrally coordinated V5+ species are the most active for propane dehydrogenation, while the formation of an AlVO4 phase at higher loadings decreases activity. The dispersion of these active species on the alumina surface is crucial for propene selectivity, with higher dispersion leading to higher selectivity. The study also highlights the importance of calcination temperature, showing that temperatures around 873 K promote the formation of active tetrahedrally coordinated V5+ species, while higher temperatures lead to less active bulk-like or crystalline V2O5 species.

给定的科学文献并没有直接讨论推动钒氧化物基催化剂作为Pt和CrOx替代品用于烷烃脱氢的因素，也没有讨论自1980年代以来该领域的研究如何发展。该文献主要关注支持在氧化铝上的钒氧化物物种在丙烷氧化脱氢中的表征和催化性能，而不是提供更广泛的历史背景或与其他类型催化剂的比较。

然而，该文献确实提供了一些关于金属负载量和焙烧温度等变量如何影响这些催化剂中钒物种的性质和行为的见解。研究表明，增加钒负载量（从4.5到13.2 wt%）和焙烧温度（从773到973 K）会影响钒物种在氧化铝载体上的配位、分散和相组成。这些因素进而影响丙烷脱氢的催化活性和选择性。

研究表明，孤立和聚合的四面体配位V5+物种对丙烷脱氢最为活跃，而在较高负载量下形成的AlVO4相会降低活性。这些活性物种在氧化铝表面的分散对丙烯选择性至关重要，更高的分散度会导致更高的选择性。研究还强调了焙烧温度的重要性，表明约873 K的温度有利于形成活性的四面体配位V5+物种，而更高的温度会导致活性较低的块状或结晶V2O5物种。
