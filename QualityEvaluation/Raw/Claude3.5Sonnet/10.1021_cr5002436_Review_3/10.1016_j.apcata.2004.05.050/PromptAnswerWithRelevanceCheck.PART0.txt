[1] "Supported vanadium oxides have been widely used as catalysts for a number of reactions. The molecular structure of the surface vanadium oxide species and the catalytic properties are influenced by the method of preparation, the nature of support, promotors and environmental conditions"

[2] "Vanadia species dispersed on alumina offer a broad range of VOx structures [3] and show a high activity and selectivity for the production of alkenes from the corresponding alkanes"

[3] "Nature of vanadium species on alumina depends not only on vanadium loadings but also on calcination temperature."

[4] "After calcination of V(4.5 wt.%)/Al2O3 at 873 K dispersed isolated and polymerized V5+ species in tetrahedral coordination dominate, with the later being the main species. With increasing vanadium loadings up to 13.2 wt.% the portion of dispersed VOx species decreased and the portion of vanadium present in a crystalline AlVO4 phase increased."

[5] "The catalytic activity for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane is determined by the amount of dispersed isolated and polymerised tetrahedrally coordinated V5+ species."

[6] "Propene selectivity depends on the dispersion of the tetrahedrally coordinated V5+ species; the higher the dispersion, the higher the propene selectivity."

The exploration of vanadium oxide-based catalysts as alternatives for paraffin dehydrogenation has been driven by their broad range of VOx structures and high activity and selectivity for alkene production. Research in this area has evolved to focus on understanding how various factors influence the nature and behavior of vanadium species in these catalysts.

Key variables that influence vanadium species include:

1. Carrier type: Different supports like alumina affect the molecular structure of surface vanadium oxide species.

2. Support surface area: This impacts the dispersion of vanadium species, which in turn affects catalytic activity and selectivity.

3. Metal loading: Increasing vanadium loadings changes the distribution of vanadium species, with higher loadings leading to more crystalline phases like AlVO4.

4. Calcination temperature: This significantly affects the nature of vanadium species formed on the support.

The research has revealed that dispersed isolated and polymerized V5+ species in tetrahedral coordination are the most active for propane dehydrogenation. Higher dispersion of these species leads to better propene selectivity. The study of these variables has allowed researchers to optimize catalyst composition and preparation methods for improved performance in paraffin dehydrogenation reactions.

The exploration of vanadium oxide-based catalysts as alternatives to Pt and CrOx for paraffin dehydrogenation has been driven by several factors:

1. Versatility: Supported vanadium oxides have been widely used as catalysts for various reactions.

2. Tunability: The molecular structure and catalytic properties of surface vanadium oxide species can be influenced by preparation methods, support nature, promoters, and environmental conditions.

Research in this area has evolved since the 1980s through the application of various characterization techniques, including XRD, Raman spectroscopy, solid-state NMR, ESR, TPR, FT-IR, and UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy. These techniques have allowed researchers to better understand the structure and properties of vanadium species on support surfaces.

Variables such as carrier type, support surface area, and metal loading significantly influence the nature and behavior of vanadium species in these catalysts:

1. Vanadium loading: Different vanadium oxide species (V5+) form on the alumina surface after calcination, depending on the loading. At lower coverages, isolated and polymerized VO4 units dominate, while VO6 octahedra become predominant at higher loadings.

2. Calcination temperature: The nature of vanadium species on alumina depends on both vanadium loadings and calcination temperature.

3. Support surface area: This can affect the dispersion and distribution of vanadium species on the support.

For example, after calcination of V(4.5 wt.%)/Al2O3 at 873 K, dispersed isolated and polymerized V5+ species in tetrahedral coordination dominate, with the latter being the main species. This demonstrates how the combination of metal loading and calcination temperature can influence the resulting vanadium species in the catalyst.

作为铂和氧化铬催化剂在烷烃脱氢反应中的替代品，钒氧化物基催化剂的研究受到了以下因素的推动：

1. 多功能性：负载型钒氧化物已被广泛用作多种反应的催化剂。

2. 可调性：表面钒氧化物物种的分子结构和催化性能可以通过制备方法、载体性质、助剂和环境条件来调控。

自20世纪80年代以来，该领域的研究通过应用各种表征技术而不断发展，包括XRD、拉曼光谱、固态核磁共振、电子自旋共振、程序升温还原、傅里叶变换红外光谱和紫外-可见漫反射光谱。这些技术使研究人员能够更好地理解载体表面钒物种的结构和性质。

载体类型、载体表面积和金属负载量等变量显著影响了这些催化剂中钒物种的性质和行为：

1. 钒负载量：根据负载量的不同，氧化铝表面会在焙烧后形成不同的钒氧化物物种（V5+）。在较低覆盖度下，以孤立和聚合的VO4单元为主，而在较高负载量下，VO6八面体结构占主导地位。

2. 焙烧温度：氧化铝上钒物种的性质不仅取决于钒负载量，还取决于焙烧温度。

3. 载体表面积：这可能影响钒物种在载体上的分散和分布。

例如，在873 K下焙烧V(4.5 wt.%)/Al2O3后，分散的孤立和聚合的四面体配位V5+物种占主导地位，其中后者是主要物种。这表明金属负载量和焙烧温度的组合如何影响催化剂中最终形成的钒物种。

The given scientific literature does not directly address the factors that have driven the exploration of vanadium oxide-based catalysts as alternatives to Pt and CrOx for paraffin dehydrogenation, nor does it discuss how research in this area has evolved since the 1980s. The document focuses specifically on the characterization and catalytic performance of vanadium oxide species supported on alumina for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane, rather than providing a broader historical context or comparison to other catalyst types.

However, the literature does provide some insights into how variables such as metal loading and calcination temperature influence the nature and behavior of vanadium species in these catalysts. The study shows that increasing vanadium loadings (from 4.5 to 13.2 wt%) and calcination temperature (from 773 to 973 K) affect the coordination, dispersion, and phase composition of vanadium species on the alumina support. These factors in turn influence the catalytic activity and selectivity for propane dehydrogenation.

The research demonstrates that isolated and polymerized tetrahedrally coordinated V5+ species are the most active for propane dehydrogenation, while the formation of an AlVO4 phase at higher loadings decreases activity. The dispersion of these active species on the alumina surface is crucial for propene selectivity, with higher dispersion leading to higher selectivity. The study also highlights the importance of calcination temperature, showing that temperatures around 873 K promote the formation of active tetrahedrally coordinated V5+ species, while higher temperatures lead to less active bulk-like or crystalline V2O5 species.

给定的科学文献并没有直接讨论推动钒氧化物基催化剂作为Pt和CrOx替代品用于烷烃脱氢的因素，也没有讨论自1980年代以来该领域的研究如何发展。该文献主要关注支持在氧化铝上的钒氧化物物种在丙烷氧化脱氢中的表征和催化性能，而不是提供更广泛的历史背景或与其他类型催化剂的比较。

然而，该文献确实提供了一些关于金属负载量和焙烧温度等变量如何影响这些催化剂中钒物种的性质和行为的见解。研究表明，增加钒负载量（从4.5到13.2 wt%）和焙烧温度（从773到973 K）会影响钒物种在氧化铝载体上的配位、分散和相组成。这些因素进而影响丙烷脱氢的催化活性和选择性。

研究表明，孤立和聚合的四面体配位V5+物种对丙烷脱氢最为活跃，而在较高负载量下形成的AlVO4相会降低活性。这些活性物种在氧化铝表面的分散对丙烯选择性至关重要，更高的分散度会导致更高的选择性。研究还强调了焙烧温度的重要性，表明约873 K的温度有利于形成活性的四面体配位V5+物种，而更高的温度会导致活性较低的块状或结晶V2O5物种。
