[1] "Supported vanadium oxides have been widely used as catalysts for a number of reactions. The molecular structure of the surface vanadium oxide species and the catalytic properties are influenced by the method of preparation, the nature of support, promotors and environmental conditions"

[2] "Different techniques like XRD, Raman spectroscopy, solid-state NMR, ESR, TPR, FT-IR and UVvis diffuse reflectance spectra (DRS) have been applied to characterize the structure of vanadium species on the surface of alumina"

[3] "Depending on the vanadium loadings, different vanadium oxide species (V5+) were formed on the surface of alumina after calcination. Mainly isolated and polymerized VO4 units were observed at coverages up to a monolayer while VO6 octahedra were predominant on catalyst surfaces at higher vanadium loadings"

[4] "Nature of vanadium species on alumina depends not only on vanadium loadings but also on calcination temperature."

[5] "After calcination of V(4.5 wt.%)/Al2O3 at 873 K dispersed isolated and polymerized V5+ species in tetrahedral coordination dominate, with the later being the main species."

The exploration of vanadium oxide-based catalysts as alternatives to Pt and CrOx for paraffin dehydrogenation has been driven by several factors:

1. Versatility: Supported vanadium oxides have been widely used as catalysts for various reactions.

2. Tunability: The molecular structure and catalytic properties of surface vanadium oxide species can be influenced by preparation methods, support nature, promoters, and environmental conditions.

Research in this area has evolved since the 1980s through the application of various characterization techniques, including XRD, Raman spectroscopy, solid-state NMR, ESR, TPR, FT-IR, and UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy. These techniques have allowed researchers to better understand the structure and properties of vanadium species on support surfaces.

Variables such as carrier type, support surface area, and metal loading significantly influence the nature and behavior of vanadium species in these catalysts:

1. Vanadium loading: Different vanadium oxide species (V5+) form on the alumina surface after calcination, depending on the loading. At lower coverages, isolated and polymerized VO4 units dominate, while VO6 octahedra become predominant at higher loadings.

2. Calcination temperature: The nature of vanadium species on alumina depends on both vanadium loadings and calcination temperature.

3. Support surface area: This can affect the dispersion and distribution of vanadium species on the support.

For example, after calcination of V(4.5 wt.%)/Al2O3 at 873 K, dispersed isolated and polymerized V5+ species in tetrahedral coordination dominate, with the latter being the main species. This demonstrates how the combination of metal loading and calcination temperature can influence the resulting vanadium species in the catalyst.

作为铂和氧化铬催化剂在烷烃脱氢反应中的替代品，钒氧化物基催化剂的研究受到了以下因素的推动：

1. 多功能性：负载型钒氧化物已被广泛用作多种反应的催化剂。

2. 可调性：表面钒氧化物物种的分子结构和催化性能可以通过制备方法、载体性质、助剂和环境条件来调控。

自20世纪80年代以来，该领域的研究通过应用各种表征技术而不断发展，包括XRD、拉曼光谱、固态核磁共振、电子自旋共振、程序升温还原、傅里叶变换红外光谱和紫外-可见漫反射光谱。这些技术使研究人员能够更好地理解载体表面钒物种的结构和性质。

载体类型、载体表面积和金属负载量等变量显著影响了这些催化剂中钒物种的性质和行为：

1. 钒负载量：根据负载量的不同，氧化铝表面会在焙烧后形成不同的钒氧化物物种（V5+）。在较低覆盖度下，以孤立和聚合的VO4单元为主，而在较高负载量下，VO6八面体结构占主导地位。

2. 焙烧温度：氧化铝上钒物种的性质不仅取决于钒负载量，还取决于焙烧温度。

3. 载体表面积：这可能影响钒物种在载体上的分散和分布。

例如，在873 K下焙烧V(4.5 wt.%)/Al2O3后，分散的孤立和聚合的四面体配位V5+物种占主导地位，其中后者是主要物种。这表明金属负载量和焙烧温度的组合如何影响催化剂中最终形成的钒物种。
