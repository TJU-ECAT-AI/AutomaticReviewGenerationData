[1] "Of several catalysts, supported group 5 and 6 metal oxides, typically VOx, (101, 132, 133) NbOx, (134) CrOx, (18, 127) MoOx, and WOx, (135) are particularly interesting."

[2] "The best catalyst used for the oxidative dehydrogenation of alkane (ODH), and typically that of propane, is based on VOx supported on oxide materials, (98, 130, 131, 133) but MoOx supported catalysts are becoming competitive."

[3] "Independently of the catalysts and the reactions, the CH bond activation is often the rate determining step."

[4] "Despite years of research, the yields are still limited, and this reaction needs to operate at low conversions to avoid large amounts of overoxidation products (COx)."

[5] "Small clusters and particularly isolated sites on fully covered oxide surfaces have been proposed to be essential to achieve high selectivities."

Research on vanadium oxide-based catalysts for paraffin dehydrogenation has been driven by the need to find alternatives to platinum and chromium oxide catalysts. Since the 1980s, studies have focused on supported group 5 and 6 metal oxides, with vanadium oxide (VOx) emerging as one of the most promising options, particularly for oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes like propane.

The evolution of research in this area has led to a better understanding of the importance of catalyst structure and composition. Factors such as the type of carrier (support material), surface area of the support, and metal loading have been found to significantly influence the nature and behavior of vanadium species in these catalysts.

Key findings include:

1. The importance of isolated sites and small clusters on fully covered oxide surfaces for achieving high selectivities.

2. The identification of CH bond activation as the rate-determining step in many cases.

3. The challenge of limited yields and the need to operate at low conversions to avoid overoxidation.

4. The competitive emergence of MoOx-supported catalysts alongside VOx-based systems.

Despite progress, challenges remain in optimizing yield and selectivity, particularly in avoiding the formation of undesired COx products. The research continues to evolve, focusing on fine-tuning catalyst composition and structure to improve performance in paraffin dehydrogenation reactions.

对于烷烃脱氢反应，钒氧化物基催化剂的研究一直以来都在寻求替代铂和氧化铬催化剂。自20世纪80年代以来，研究重点集中在负载的第5族和第6族金属氧化物上，其中钒氧化物(VOx)作为最有前景的选择之一脱颖而出，特别是在烷烃（如丙烷）的氧化脱氢方面。

这一领域的研究演变使我们对催化剂结构和成分的重要性有了更好的理解。载体类型（支撑材料）、支撑体的表面积和金属负载量等因素被发现对这些催化剂中钒物种的性质和行为有显著影响。

主要发现包括：

1. 完全覆盖的氧化物表面上的孤立位点和小簇对于实现高选择性的重要性。

2. 在许多情况下，CH键活化被确定为反应的限速步骤。

3. 产率有限的挑战，以及需要在低转化率下操作以避免过度氧化。

4. MoOx负载催化剂与VOx基系统并驾齐驱的竞争性出现。

尽管取得了进展，但在优化产率和选择性方面仍然存在挑战，特别是在避免形成不需要的COx产物方面。研究仍在继续发展，重点是微调催化剂的组成和结构，以改善烷烃脱氢反应的性能。
