[1] "Supported vanadium oxides, and, in particular, VOx, (101, 132, 133) NbOx, (134) CrOx, (18, 127) MoOx, and WOx, (135) are particularly interesting. These systems are characterized by the presence of isolated sites or small clusters at a low surface coverage; with bulk oxides being formed only at higher surface coverage (above a monolayer)."

[2] "Of several catalysts, supported group 5 and 6 metal oxides, typically VOx, (101, 132, 133) NbOx, (134) CrOx, (18, 127) MoOx, and WOx, (135) are particularly interesting."

[3] "The best catalyst used for the oxidative dehydrogenation of alkane (ODH), and typically that of propane, is based on VOx supported on oxide materials, (98, 130, 131, 133) but MoOx supported catalysts are becoming competitive."

[4] "While leading to very different products, these reactions have common reaction intermediates and have the same rate determining step, i.e. CH bond activation."

Research on vanadium oxide-based catalysts for paraffin dehydrogenation has evolved since the 1980s as an alternative to platinum and chromium oxide catalysts. Key factors driving this exploration include:

1. The ability to form isolated sites or small clusters at low surface coverage, with bulk oxides only forming at higher coverage. This allows for better control of active sites.

2. Versatility across Group 5 and 6 metal oxides, including VOx, NbOx, CrOx, MoOx, and WOx. This provides options for tuning catalyst properties.

3. Superior performance in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions, particularly for propane, compared to traditional catalysts.

4. Common reaction intermediates and rate-determining steps (CH bond activation) across different reactions, allowing for mechanistic insights.

Variables influencing vanadium species behavior include:

1. Carrier type: The choice of oxide support material affects dispersion and interactions.

2. Support surface area: Higher surface areas generally allow for better dispersion of active sites.

3. Metal loading: Impacts whether isolated sites, small clusters, or bulk oxides form.

These factors collectively determine the nature, dispersion, and catalytic behavior of vanadium species in the catalysts. Research has focused on optimizing these variables to enhance activity and selectivity for specific dehydrogenation reactions.

自20世纪80年代以来,作为铂和氧化铬催化剂的替代品,钒氧化物基催化剂在烷烃脱氢方面的研究不断发展。推动这一探索的关键因素包括:

1. 在低表面覆盖率下能够形成孤立位点或小簇,只有在更高覆盖率下才形成块状氧化物。这允许更好地控制活性位点。

2. 在第5和第6族金属氧化物中的通用性,包括VOx、NbOx、CrOx、MoOx和WOx。这为调整催化剂性能提供了选择。

3. 与传统催化剂相比,在氧化脱氢反应中表现出色,特别是对于丙烷。

4. 不同反应中具有共同的反应中间体和决速步骤(CH键活化),允许进行机理洞察。

影响钒物种行为的变量包括:

1. 载体类型:氧化物支撑材料的选择影响分散性和相互作用。

2. 支撑体表面积:较高的表面积通常允许活性位点更好地分散。

3. 金属负载量:影响是否形成孤立位点、小簇或块状氧化物。

这些因素共同决定了催化剂中钒物种的性质、分散性和催化行为。研究集中在优化这些变量,以增强特定脱氢反应的活性和选择性。
