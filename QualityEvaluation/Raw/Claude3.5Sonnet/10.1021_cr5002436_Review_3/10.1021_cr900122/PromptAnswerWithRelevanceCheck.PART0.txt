Research on vanadium oxide-based catalysts for paraffin dehydrogenation has been driven by the need to find alternatives to platinum and chromium oxide catalysts. Since the 1980s, studies have focused on supported group 5 and 6 metal oxides, with vanadium oxide (VOx) emerging as one of the most promising options, particularly for oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes like propane.

The evolution of research in this area has led to a better understanding of the importance of catalyst structure and composition. Factors such as the type of carrier (support material), surface area of the support, and metal loading have been found to significantly influence the nature and behavior of vanadium species in these catalysts.

Key findings include:

1. The importance of isolated sites and small clusters on fully covered oxide surfaces for achieving high selectivities.

2. The identification of CH bond activation as the rate-determining step in many cases.

3. The challenge of limited yields and the need to operate at low conversions to avoid overoxidation.

4. The competitive emergence of MoOx-supported catalysts alongside VOx-based systems.

Despite progress, challenges remain in optimizing yield and selectivity, particularly in avoiding the formation of undesired COx products. The research continues to evolve, focusing on fine-tuning catalyst composition and structure to improve performance in paraffin dehydrogenation reactions.

Research on vanadium oxide-based catalysts for paraffin dehydrogenation has been driven by the search for alternatives to platinum and chromium oxide catalysts since the 1980s. The exploration has focused on supported group 5 and 6 metal oxides, with vanadium oxide (VOx) emerging as a leading candidate, particularly for oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes like propane.

The evolution of research in this area has seen a shift from traditional dehydrogenation catalysts to oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) processes. VOx supported on oxide materials has become the best catalyst for ODH of propane, though molybdenum oxide (MoOx) supported catalysts are becoming competitive.

Variables such as carrier type, support surface area, and metal loading significantly influence the nature and behavior of vanadium species in these catalysts. These factors affect the dispersion, oxidation state, and coordination environment of vanadium, which in turn impact catalytic performance.

Despite years of research, challenges remain. Yields are still limited, and the reaction typically needs to operate at low conversions to avoid overoxidation products. The mechanism of action for these catalysts is still being elucidated, with current proposals involving CH bond activation on metal-oxygen bonds, formation of metal-alkyl intermediates, and subsequent β-H transfer steps.

The ongoing research in this field reflects the continuing effort to develop more efficient and selective catalysts for paraffin dehydrogenation, balancing activity with product selectivity and catalyst stability.

Research on vanadium oxide-based catalysts for paraffin dehydrogenation has been driven by the search for alternatives to platinum and chromium oxide catalysts since the 1980s. Vanadium oxides, along with other group 5 and 6 metal oxides like niobium, molybdenum, and tungsten oxides, have attracted significant interest due to their catalytic properties.

The evolution of research in this area has focused on improving the performance of supported vanadium oxide catalysts, particularly for oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of alkanes like propane. VOx-based catalysts have emerged as the best performers for ODH, although MoOx-supported catalysts are becoming competitive.

Several variables influence the nature and behavior of vanadium species in these catalysts:

1. Support type: Silica has been identified as the optimal support material in terms of selectivity.

2. Temperature: The optimal temperature window for the process is narrow, around 500°C. Lower temperatures favor undesired combustion reactions, while higher temperatures (>550°C) lead to unselective gas-phase reactions.

3. Metal loading: While not explicitly mentioned in the quotes, the loading of vanadium on the support can affect the dispersion and structure of the active species.

4. Surface area: Although not directly addressed in the quotes, the surface area of the support material can impact the dispersion and accessibility of the vanadium oxide species.

These factors collectively determine the performance of vanadium oxide catalysts in paraffin dehydrogenation reactions, influencing their activity, selectivity, and stability. Ongoing research continues to optimize these parameters to develop more efficient and selective catalysts for alkane conversion processes.

3. 金属负载量:虽然在引用中没有明确提到,但钒在载体上的负载量可以影响活性物种的分散和结构。

4. 表面积:虽然在引用中没有直接提到,但载体材料的表面积可以影响钒氧化物物种的分散和可及性。

这些因素共同决定了钒氧化物催化剂在烷烃脱氢反应中的性能,影响其活性、选择性和稳定性。持续的研究继续优化这些参数,以开发更高效、更选择性的烷烃转化过程催化剂。

The exploration has focused on supported group 5 and 6 metal oxides, with vanadium oxide (VOx) emerging as a particularly promising candidate.

The evolution of research in this area has led to a deeper understanding of the structure-activity relationships in these catalysts. It has been found that at low surface coverage, these systems are characterized by isolated sites or small clusters, while bulk oxides form at higher coverage above a monolayer.

Variables such as carrier type, support surface area, and metal loading significantly influence the nature and behavior of vanadium species in these catalysts. These factors determine whether the active species exist as isolated sites, small clusters, or bulk oxides, which in turn affects their catalytic performance.

VOx supported on oxide materials has been identified as the best catalyst for oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes, particularly propane. However, supported MoOx catalysts are becoming increasingly competitive.

Regardless of the specific catalyst or reaction, CH bond activation has been identified as the rate-determining step in these processes. This understanding has guided research efforts towards optimizing catalysts for this crucial step.

The research has also revealed that while different catalysts may lead to varied products, they often share common reaction intermediates, particularly in the CH bond activation step. This insight has allowed for more targeted catalyst design and optimization strategies.
