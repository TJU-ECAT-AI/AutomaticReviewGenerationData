[1] "Of several catalysts, supported group 5 and 6 metal oxides, typically VOx, (101, 132, 133) NbOx, (134) CrOx, (18, 127) MoOx, and WOx, (135) are particularly interesting."

[2] "These systems are characterized by the presence of isolated sites or small clusters at a low surface coverage; with bulk oxides being formed only at higher surface coverage (above a monolayer)."

[3] "The best catalyst used for the oxidative dehydrogenation of alkane (ODH), and typically that of propane, is based on VOx supported on oxide materials, (98, 130, 131, 133) but MoOx supported catalysts are becoming competitive."

[4] "While leading to very different products, these reactions have common reaction intermediates and have the same rate determining step, i.e. CH bond activation."

[5] "Independently of the catalysts and the reactions, the CH bond activation is often the rate determining step."

Research on vanadium oxide-based catalysts for paraffin dehydrogenation has been driven by the search for alternatives to platinum and chromium oxide catalysts since the 1980s. The exploration has focused on supported group 5 and 6 metal oxides, with vanadium oxide (VOx) emerging as a particularly promising candidate.

The evolution of research in this area has led to a deeper understanding of the structure-activity relationships in these catalysts. It has been found that at low surface coverage, these systems are characterized by isolated sites or small clusters, while bulk oxides form at higher coverage above a monolayer.

Variables such as carrier type, support surface area, and metal loading significantly influence the nature and behavior of vanadium species in these catalysts. These factors determine whether the active species exist as isolated sites, small clusters, or bulk oxides, which in turn affects their catalytic performance.

VOx supported on oxide materials has been identified as the best catalyst for oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes, particularly propane. However, supported MoOx catalysts are becoming increasingly competitive.

Regardless of the specific catalyst or reaction, CH bond activation has been identified as the rate-determining step in these processes. This understanding has guided research efforts towards optimizing catalysts for this crucial step.

The research has also revealed that while different catalysts may lead to varied products, they often share common reaction intermediates, particularly in the CH bond activation step. This insight has allowed for more targeted catalyst design and optimization strategies.

自20世纪80年代以来,对烷烃脱氢反应中钒氧化物基催化剂的研究一直致力于寻找铂和铬氧化物催化剂的替代品。这项研究主要集中在负载型5族和6族金属氧化物上,其中钒氧化物(VOx)显示出特别有前景的表现。

这一领域研究的演变使我们对这些催化剂的结构-活性关系有了更深入的理解。研究发现,在低表面覆盖度时,这些系统以孤立位点或小簇的形式存在,而在高于单层的覆盖度时则形成体相氧化物。

载体类型、支撑体表面积和金属负载量等变量显著影响了这些催化剂中钒物种的性质和行为。这些因素决定了活性物种是以孤立位点、小簇还是体相氧化物的形式存在,进而影响其催化性能。

研究表明,负载在氧化物材料上的VOx是烷烃氧化脱氢的最佳催化剂,特别是对于丙烷。然而,负载型MoOx催化剂正变得越来越具有竞争力。

无论是何种具体的催化剂或反应,CH键活化都被认定为这些过程中的决速步骤。这一认识指导了研究efforts朝着优化这一关键步骤的催化剂方向发展。

研究还揭示,尽管不同的催化剂可能导致不同的产物,但它们在反应中often具有共同的中间体,特别是在CH键活化步骤中。这一见解使得更有针对性的催化剂设计和优化策略成为可能。
