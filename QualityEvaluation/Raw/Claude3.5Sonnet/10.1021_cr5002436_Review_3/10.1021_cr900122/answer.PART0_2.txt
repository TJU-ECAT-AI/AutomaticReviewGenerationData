[1] "Of several catalysts, supported group 5 and 6 metal oxides, typically VOx, (101, 132, 133) NbOx, (134) CrOx, (18, 127) MoOx, and WOx, (135) are particularly interesting."

[2] "The best catalyst used for the oxidative dehydrogenation of alkane (ODH), and typically that of propane, is based on VOx supported on oxide materials, (98, 130, 131, 133) but MoOx supported catalysts are becoming competitive."

[3] "Overall, silica can be regarded as the optimal support in terms of selectivity. Another important fact is that the optimal temperature window for this process is quite narrow, and around 500 C, lower temperatures favor combustion while unselective gas phase reactions start to be competitive at higher temperatures (>550 C)."

Research on vanadium oxide-based catalysts for paraffin dehydrogenation has been driven by the search for alternatives to platinum and chromium oxide catalysts since the 1980s. Vanadium oxides, along with other group 5 and 6 metal oxides like niobium, molybdenum, and tungsten oxides, have attracted significant interest due to their catalytic properties.

The evolution of research in this area has focused on improving the performance of supported vanadium oxide catalysts, particularly for oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of alkanes like propane. VOx-based catalysts have emerged as the best performers for ODH, although MoOx-supported catalysts are becoming competitive.

Several variables influence the nature and behavior of vanadium species in these catalysts:

1. Support type: Silica has been identified as the optimal support material in terms of selectivity.

2. Temperature: The optimal temperature window for the process is narrow, around 500°C. Lower temperatures favor undesired combustion reactions, while higher temperatures (>550°C) lead to unselective gas-phase reactions.

3. Metal loading: While not explicitly mentioned in the quotes, the loading of vanadium on the support can affect the dispersion and structure of the active species.

4. Surface area: Although not directly addressed in the quotes, the surface area of the support material can impact the dispersion and accessibility of the vanadium oxide species.

These factors collectively determine the performance of vanadium oxide catalysts in paraffin dehydrogenation reactions, influencing their activity, selectivity, and stability. Ongoing research continues to optimize these parameters to develop more efficient and selective catalysts for alkane conversion processes.

自20世纪80年代以来,对钒氧化物基催化剂用于烷烃脱氢的研究一直致力于寻找铂和氧化铬催化剂的替代品。钒氧化物以及其他第5和第6族金属氧化物(如铌、钼和钨氧化物)因其催化性能而引起了极大的兴趣。

这一领域的研究演变主要集中在改善负载型钒氧化物催化剂的性能,特别是用于烷烃(如丙烷)的氧化脱氢(ODH)。VOx基催化剂已成为ODH反应的最佳催化剂,尽管MoOx负载型催化剂也正变得具有竞争力。

几个变量影响这些催化剂中钒物种的性质和行为:

1. 载体类型:二氧化硅被确定为在选择性方面最佳的载体材料。

2. 温度:该过程的最佳温度窗口很窄,约为500°C。较低的温度有利于不需要的燃烧反应,而较高的温度(>550°C)会导致非选择性的气相反应。

3. 金属负载量:虽然在引用中没有明确提到,但钒在载体上的负载量可以影响活性物种的分散和结构。

4. 表面积:虽然在引用中没有直接提到,但载体材料的表面积可以影响钒氧化物物种的分散和可及性。

这些因素共同决定了钒氧化物催化剂在烷烃脱氢反应中的性能,影响其活性、选择性和稳定性。持续的研究继续优化这些参数,以开发更高效、更选择性的烷烃转化过程催化剂。
