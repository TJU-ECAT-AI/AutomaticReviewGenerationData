[1] "Of several catalysts, supported group 5 and 6 metal oxides, typically VOx, (101, 132, 133) NbOx, (134) CrOx, (18, 127) MoOx, and WOx, (135) are particularly interesting."

[2] "The best catalyst used for the oxidative dehydrogenation of alkane (ODH), and typically that of propane, is based on VOx supported on oxide materials, (98, 130, 131, 133) but MoOx supported catalysts are becoming competitive."

[3] "Despite years of research, the yields are still limited, and this reaction needs to operate at low conversions to avoid large amounts of overoxidation products (COx)."

[4] "The current proposed mechanism involves the CH bond activation on a CrOS bond, thus forming a Cr-alkyl intermediate, which can decompose via β-H transfer, (138, 139) to form the alkene and a CrIIIH surface species."

Research on vanadium oxide-based catalysts for paraffin dehydrogenation has been driven by the search for alternatives to platinum and chromium oxide catalysts since the 1980s. The exploration has focused on supported group 5 and 6 metal oxides, with vanadium oxide (VOx) emerging as a leading candidate, particularly for oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes like propane.

The evolution of research in this area has seen a shift from traditional dehydrogenation catalysts to oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) processes. VOx supported on oxide materials has become the best catalyst for ODH of propane, though molybdenum oxide (MoOx) supported catalysts are becoming competitive.

Variables such as carrier type, support surface area, and metal loading significantly influence the nature and behavior of vanadium species in these catalysts. These factors affect the dispersion, oxidation state, and coordination environment of vanadium, which in turn impact catalytic performance.

Despite years of research, challenges remain. Yields are still limited, and the reaction typically needs to operate at low conversions to avoid overoxidation products. The mechanism of action for these catalysts is still being elucidated, with current proposals involving CH bond activation on metal-oxygen bonds, formation of metal-alkyl intermediates, and subsequent β-H transfer steps.

The ongoing research in this field reflects the continuing effort to develop more efficient and selective catalysts for paraffin dehydrogenation, balancing activity with product selectivity and catalyst stability.

自20世纪80年代以来,对钒氧化物基催化剂用于烷烃脱氢的研究一直在寻找铂和铬氧化物催化剂的替代品。研究重点集中在负载的第5和第6族金属氧化物上,其中钒氧化物(VOx)成为领先的候选者,特别是用于烷烃(如丙烷)的氧化脱氢。

该领域研究的演变经历了从传统脱氢催化剂到氧化脱氢(ODH)过程的转变。负载在氧化物材料上的VOx已成为丙烷ODH的最佳催化剂,尽管负载的钼氧化物(MoOx)催化剂正在变得具有竞争力。

载体类型、支撑表面积和金属负载量等变量显著影响这些催化剂中钒物种的性质和行为。这些因素影响钒的分散性、氧化态和配位环境,进而影响催化性能。

尽管经过多年的研究,挑战依然存在。产率仍然有限,反应通常需要在低转化率下进行以避免过度氧化产物。这些催化剂的作用机理仍在阐明中,目前的提议涉及金属-氧键上的CH键活化、金属-烷基中间体的形成以及随后的β-H转移步骤。

该领域的持续研究反映了在开发更高效和选择性的烷烃脱氢催化剂方面的不断努力,平衡活性、产品选择性和催化剂稳定性。
