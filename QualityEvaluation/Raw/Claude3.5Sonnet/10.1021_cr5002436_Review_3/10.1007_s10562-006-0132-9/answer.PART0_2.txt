The given literature does not directly address the specific questions about the history and evolution of vanadium oxide-based catalysts for paraffin dehydrogenation since the 1980s. The text focuses on a specific study of vanadium magnesium oxide catalysts supported on different materials for isobutane dehydrogenation, rather than providing a broad historical overview. 

However, based on the information provided, we can infer some relevant points:

1. Vanadium oxide-based catalysts are being explored as alternatives to traditional catalysts for paraffin dehydrogenation.

2. The type of support material (e.g., Cact, SiO2, Al2O3, ZnO) significantly influences the catalytic performance of vanadium magnesium oxide catalysts.

3. Surface area, acidity/basicity, and redox properties of the supported catalysts play crucial roles in determining their activity and selectivity.

4. The nature and behavior of vanadium species are affected by the support material, as evidenced by differences in reducibility and interaction with carbon dioxide.

5. Metal loading (in this case, the V/Mg ratio) is an important factor in catalyst preparation and performance.

While the text doesn't provide a historical perspective, it demonstrates ongoing research interest in optimizing vanadium oxide-based catalysts for paraffin dehydrogenation by exploring various support materials and understanding the factors that influence catalytic behavior.

给定的文献并未直接回答关于钒氧化物基催化剂在烷烃脱氢方面自1980年代以来的历史和发展的具体问题。该文本主要关注钒镁氧化物催化剂在不同载体上用于异丁烷脱氢的特定研究，而非提供广泛的历史概述。

然而，根据所提供的信息，我们可以推断出一些相关要点：

1. 钒氧化物基催化剂正在被探索作为传统烷烃脱氢催化剂的替代品。

2. 载体材料的类型（如活性炭、二氧化硅、氧化铝、氧化锌）显著影响钒镁氧化物催化剂的催化性能。

3. 负载催化剂的表面积、酸碱性和氧化还原性质在决定其活性和选择性方面起着关键作用。

4. 钒物种的性质和行为受载体材料影响，这从还原性和与二氧化碳的相互作用的差异中可以看出。

5. 金属负载量（在本例中为V/Mg比率）是催化剂制备和性能的一个重要因素。

虽然文本没有提供历史视角，但它表明通过探索各种载体材料并理解影响催化行为的因素，对优化钒氧化物基催化剂用于烷烃脱氢的持续研究兴趣。
