The provided literature does not contain information directly addressing the evolution of research on vanadium oxide-based catalysts as alternatives to Pt and CrOx for paraffin dehydrogenation since the 1980s. The text focuses on a specific study of vanadium magnesium oxide catalysts supported on various materials for isobutane dehydrogenation, rather than providing a historical overview of the field.

However, based on the content, we can infer some factors influencing vanadium species behavior in these catalysts:

1. Support type significantly affects catalyst performance. The study examined Cact, SiO2, γ-Al2O3, and ZnO as supports.

2. Surface area plays a role, but is not the primary factor determining catalytic activity. 

3. Redox and acid-base properties of the catalysts are crucial for their performance.

4. The nature of the support influences the reducibility of vanadium species and the acid-base characteristics of the catalyst surface.

5. Metal loading (V/Mg ratio) was kept constant in this study at 0.11, but its influence is implied to be important.

6. The study suggests that the interaction between vanadium species and the support material affects the catalytic behavior and stability of the active sites.

提供的文献并没有直接涉及钒氧化物基催化剂作为铂和铬氧化物替代品用于烷烃脱氢的研究演变自20世纪80年代以来的信息。该文本主要集中在研究钒镁氧化物催化剂负载在各种材料上用于异丁烷脱氢的具体研究，而不是提供该领域的历史概述。

然而，根据文章内容，我们可以推断出一些影响这些催化剂中钒物种行为的因素：

1. 载体类型显著影响催化剂性能。该研究考察了活性炭、二氧化硅、γ-氧化铝和氧化锌作为载体。

2. 表面积起作用，但不是决定催化活性的主要因素。

3. 催化剂的氧化还原和酸碱性质对其性能至关重要。

4. 载体的性质影响钒物种的可还原性和催化剂表面的酸碱特性。

5. 金属负载量（V/Mg比率）在本研究中保持恒定在0.11，但暗示其影响很重要。

6. 研究表明，钒物种与载体材料之间的相互作用影响活性位点的催化行为和稳定性。

1. The type of support (Cact, SiO2, Al2O3, ZnO) significantly affects catalyst performance in isobutane dehydrogenation.

2. Surface area alone is not the crucial factor determining catalytic activity. Redox and acid-base properties of the catalysts play a more important role.

3. The nature of the support influences the reducibility and acid-base characteristics of the vanadium species, which in turn affects catalyst behavior.

4. Factors like low reducibility (e.g., in silica-supported VMgOx) lead to low isobutane conversion, while the acidic/basic character of the support impacts carbon dioxide conversion.

5. The type of support affects the temperature of maximum hydrogen consumption and the content of strong acid and basic sites on the catalyst surface.

While the document does not discuss metal loading specifically, it does highlight how the interplay between vanadium species and different support materials influences catalyst performance in paraffin dehydrogenation reactions.

给定的文献并未直接讨论钒氧化物基催化剂作为Pt和CrOx替代品用于烷烃脱氢的研究自20世纪80年代以来的演变。该文档主要关注钒镁氧化物催化剂负载在各种材料上用于异丁烷脱氢的具体研究，而不是提供该领域的历史概述。

3. 支撑材料的性质影响钒物种的可还原性和酸碱特性，进而影响催化剂的行为。

4. 低可还原性等因素（例如在硅胶支撑的VMgOx中）导致低异丁烷转化率，而支撑材料的酸性/碱性特征影响二氧化碳的转化。

5. 支撑材料的类型影响最大氢气消耗温度和催化剂表面强酸、强碱位的含量。

虽然文档没有具体讨论金属负载量，但它确实强调了钒物种与不同支撑材料之间的相互作用如何影响催化剂在烷烃脱氢反应中的性能。

The given literature does not directly address the evolution of vanadium oxide-based catalyst research since the 1980s or compare them to Pt and CrOx catalysts for paraffin dehydrogenation. The text focuses specifically on vanadium-magnesium oxide catalysts supported on various materials for isobutane dehydrogenation, rather than providing a broad historical perspective.

However, the study does examine how different supports (Cact, SiO2, Al2O3, ZnO) influence the behavior of VMgOx catalysts. Key findings include:

1. Support surface area is not the most critical factor in catalytic activity.

2. Redox and acid-base properties of the catalysts strongly influence performance.

3. Silica-supported VMgOx shows low isobutane conversion due to low reducibility and predominantly acidic character.

4. Active carbon, alumina, and zinc oxide supports improve CO2 activation due to their low acidity and high concentration of strong basic centers.

5. Support type affects the temperature of maximum hydrogen consumption and the content of strong acid and basic sites.

The study demonstrates that carrier type significantly impacts the nature and behavior of vanadium species, influencing reducibility, acid-base properties, and overall catalytic performance in isobutane dehydrogenation.

The provided literature does not directly address the evolution of research on vanadium oxide-based catalysts as alternatives to Pt and CrOx for paraffin dehydrogenation since the 1980s. The document focuses on a specific study of vanadium magnesium oxide catalysts supported on different materials for isobutane dehydrogenation, rather than providing a historical overview of the field. 

However, based on the information given, we can infer that factors driving exploration of vanadium-based catalysts likely include their lower cost compared to noble metals like platinum, and potentially better stability or selectivity than chromium oxide catalysts.

The study demonstrates that variables such as support type, surface area, and acid-base properties significantly influence the behavior of vanadium species in these catalysts. For example:

1. Support surface area affects catalyst performance, but is not the sole determining factor.

2. The nature of the support (e.g. SiO2, Al2O3, ZnO, activated carbon) impacts the redox and acid-base properties of the catalyst, which in turn affect its activity and selectivity.

3. The support influences the reducibility of vanadium species and the strength/distribution of acid and base sites on the catalyst surface.

4. These properties determine how the catalyst interacts with reactants like isobutane and CO2, influencing reaction pathways and product distribution.

While the document does not provide historical context, it illustrates the complexity of factors affecting vanadium oxide catalyst behavior and the ongoing research to optimize these systems for paraffin dehydrogenation reactions.
