[1] "Although vanadia catalysts have not been used commercially there is a significant literature concerning the dehydrogenation reaction over supported vanadia systems."

[2] "The possibility of using oxide systems other than chromia is being explored in an effort to make the alkane-alkene conversion process more selective and stable. Supported VOx catalysts have been extensively studied for the oxidative dehydrogenation of light alkanes [...]. They have also been explored in the dehydrogenation of light alkanes including propane and butane [...] and have shown promise to be both active and selective for the dehydrogenation reactions."

[3] "Studies on alumina supported catalysts with a range of vanadia weight loadings revealed [...] that isolated VOx species dominated at surface densities below 1 V/nm2; polyvanadates coexisted with monovanadates at surface densities between 1.2-4.4 V/nm2; and V2O5 formed at a surface density higher than 4.4 V/nm2."

[4] "At low loadings the +6 state is favored on alumina. On zirconia however Cr(V) was found to be ~50% of the chromium present [22]."

Several factors have driven research into vanadium oxide catalysts as alternatives to platinum and chromium oxide for paraffin dehydrogenation:

1. The desire to develop more selective and stable catalysts for alkane-to-alkene conversion processes.

2. The promising activity and selectivity shown by supported vanadium oxide catalysts in both oxidative dehydrogenation and direct dehydrogenation of light alkanes like propane and butane.

Research in this area has evolved since the 1980s to focus on understanding how variables like carrier type, support surface area, and metal loading influence the nature and behavior of vanadium species:

1. Studies have revealed how vanadium loading affects the surface species formed, from isolated VOx species at low loadings to polyvanadates and crystalline V2O5 at higher loadings.

2. Different supports like alumina and zirconia have been found to stabilize different vanadium oxidation states.

3. Researchers have investigated how these structural differences impact catalyst performance and coke formation during dehydrogenation reactions.

Overall, while not yet commercialized, vanadium oxide catalysts have emerged as a significant area of research for developing improved dehydrogenation catalysts, with ongoing work to optimize their properties and performance.

几个因素推动了对钒氧化物催化剂作为铂和铬氧化物替代品用于烷烃脱氢的研究:

1. 希望开发出更具选择性和稳定性的烷烃到烯烃转化过程催化剂。

2. 负载型钒氧化物催化剂在轻烷烃(如丙烷和丁烷)的氧化脱氢和直接脱氢反应中表现出良好的活性和选择性。

自20世纪80年代以来,该领域的研究已经演变为关注载体类型、载体表面积和金属负载量等变量如何影响钒物种的性质和行为:

1. 研究揭示了钒负载量如何影响表面物种的形成,从低负载量时的孤立VOx物种到高负载量时的多钒酸盐和结晶V2O5。

2. 发现不同的载体(如氧化铝和二氧化锆)可以稳定不同的钒氧化态。

3. 研究人员调查了这些结构差异如何影响催化剂性能和脱氢反应过程中的积碳形成。

总的来说,虽然尚未商业化,但钒氧化物催化剂已成为开发改进型脱氢催化剂的重要研究领域,目前仍在进行优化其性能和表现的研究工作。
