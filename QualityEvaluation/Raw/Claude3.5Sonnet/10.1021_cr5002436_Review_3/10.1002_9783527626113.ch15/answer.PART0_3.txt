[1] "Although vanadia catalysts have not been used commercially there is a significant literature concerning the dehydrogenation reaction over supported vanadia systems."

[2] "The possibility of using oxide systems other than chromia is being explored in an effort to make the alkane-alkene conversion process more selective and stable. Supported VOx catalysts have been extensively studied for the oxidative dehydrogenation of light alkanes [40, 54, 68-72]. They have also been explored in the dehydrogenation of light alkanes including propane and butane [35, 39, 73, 74] and have shown promise to be both active and selective for the dehydrogenation reactions."

[3] "Studies on alumina supported catalysts with a range of vanadia weight loadings revealed [63, 64] that isolated VOx species dominated at surface densities below 1 V/nm2; polyvanadates coexisted with monovanadates at surface densities between 1.2-4.4 V/nm2; and V2O5 formed at a surface density higher than 4.4 V/nm2."

[4] "UV-Vis DRS. Before reduction the catalysts were in a V5+ oxidation state with typical charge transfer bands at 267 nm for a 1% loading, 290 nm for a 3.5% loading and 357 nm for an 8% loading. This change in position of the charge transfer band is indicative of the increasing polymeric nature of the vanadia [67]."

Factors driving exploration of vanadium oxide catalysts as alternatives include:

1. Potential for improved selectivity and stability in alkane-alkene conversion compared to chromia catalysts.

2. Promising activity and selectivity shown in studies on dehydrogenation of light alkanes like propane and butane.

Research has evolved since the 1980s to extensively study supported vanadium oxide catalysts for both oxidative dehydrogenation and direct dehydrogenation of light alkanes.

Key variables influencing vanadium species include:

1. Metal loading/surface density: Determines whether isolated, polymeric, or crystalline vanadium oxide species form.

2. Support type: Alumina is commonly used.

3. Surface area: Likely impacts dispersion and nature of vanadium species, though not explicitly stated.

The nature of vanadium species changes from isolated to polymeric to crystalline V2O5 as loading increases. This affects the catalyst's reducibility, electronic properties, and catalytic behavior in dehydrogenation reactions.

推动钒氧化物催化剂作为替代品探索的因素包括：

1. 与铬基催化剂相比，在烷烃-烯烃转化过程中具有提高选择性和稳定性的潜力。

2. 在轻烷烃如丙烷和丁烷脱氢的研究中表现出良好的活性和选择性。

自1980年代以来，研究已发展到广泛研究负载型钒氧化物催化剂用于轻烷烃的氧化脱氢和直接脱氢。

影响钒物种的关键变量包括：

1. 金属负载量/表面密度：决定是形成孤立、多聚或结晶的钒氧化物物种。

2. 载体类型：常用氧化铝。

3. 比表面积：可能影响钒物种的分散和性质，虽然未明确说明。

随着负载量的增加，钒物种的性质从孤立变为多聚再到结晶的V2O5。这影响了催化剂在脱氢反应中的可还原性、电子性质和催化行为。
