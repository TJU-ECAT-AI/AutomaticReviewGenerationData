[1] "Although vanadia catalysts have not been used commercially there is a significant literature concerning the dehydrogenation reaction over supported vanadia systems."

[2] "Supported VOx catalysts show good catalytic performance in both oxidation and reduction reactions; for example, they are among the most active and selective simple metal oxides for dehydrogenation and oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes."

[3] "The possibility of using oxide systems other than chromia is being explored in an effort to make the alkane-alkene conversion process more selective and stable."

[4] "Studies on alumina supported catalysts with a range of vanadia weight loadings revealed that isolated VOx species dominated at surface densities below 1 V/nm2; polyvanadates coexisted with monovanadates at surface densities between 1.2-4.4 V/nm2; and V2O5 formed at a surface density higher than 4.4 V/nm2."

[5] "It is rare for a structure-function relationship to be shown unambiguously in heterogeneous catalysis. However, a structure-coke relationship has been established in the dehydrogenation of butane on VOx/θ-Al2O3 catalysts by combined reactivity, UV-Vis DRS, NMR, TEOM and UV Raman investigations. In this case, both the nature and amount of coke show a dependence on the structure of the VOx/θ-Al2O3 catalysts."

Vanadium oxide-based catalysts have been explored as alternatives to Pt and CrOx for paraffin dehydrogenation due to their good catalytic performance in both oxidation and reduction reactions. They have shown promise in being highly active and selective for dehydrogenation and oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes.

Research in this area has evolved since the 1980s to focus on understanding the structure-function relationships of supported vanadia catalysts. Studies have investigated how variables such as carrier type, support surface area, and metal loading influence the nature and behavior of vanadium species.

The type of support (e.g., alumina) and vanadia loading have been found to significantly impact the structure of vanadium oxide species on the catalyst surface. At low loadings, isolated VOx species dominate, while at higher loadings polyvanadates and crystalline V2O5 form. 

These structural differences in turn affect catalyst performance and coking behavior. A clear structure-coke relationship has been established for VOx/θ-Al2O3 catalysts in butane dehydrogenation, with both the nature and amount of coke depending on the structure of the vanadium oxide species.

Advanced characterization techniques like UV-Vis DRS, NMR, TEOM and UV Raman spectroscopy have been crucial in elucidating these structure-property relationships in vanadia catalysts. While not yet used commercially, the significant research on supported vanadia systems suggests their potential as more selective and stable alternatives to chromia-based catalysts for alkane dehydrogenation.

钒氧化物基催化剂被探索作为Pt和CrOx在烷烃脱氢反应中的替代品，这是因为它们在氧化和还原反应中都表现出良好的催化性能。它们在烷烃的脱氢和氧化脱氢反应中显示出高活性和高选择性。

自20世纪80年代以来，该领域的研究已经演变为聚焦于理解负载型钒氧化物催化剂的结构-功能关系。研究人员调查了载体类型、载体表面积和金属负载量等变量如何影响钒物种的性质和行为。

载体类型（如氧化铝）和钒氧化物负载量被发现对催化剂表面钒氧化物物种的结构有显著影响。在低负载量时，孤立的VOx物种占主导地位，而在高负载量时，多聚钒酸盐和晶态V2O5形成。

这些结构差异反过来影响催化剂的性能和积碳行为。在丁烷脱氢反应中，VOx/θ-Al2O3催化剂的结构-积碳关系已经被清楚地建立，积碳的性质和数量都依赖于钒氧化物物种的结构。

先进的表征技术，如UV-Vis DRS、NMR、TEOM和UV拉曼光谱，在阐明钒催化剂的这些结构-性能关系方面起到了至关重要的作用。虽然尚未商业化使用，但对负载型钒氧化物系统的大量研究表明，它们有潜力成为比铬基催化剂更具选择性和稳定性的烷烃脱氢替代品。
