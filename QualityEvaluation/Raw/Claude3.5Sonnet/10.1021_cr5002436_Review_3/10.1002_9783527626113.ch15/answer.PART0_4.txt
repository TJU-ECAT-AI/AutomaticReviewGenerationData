[1] "Although vanadia catalysts have not been used commercially there is a significant literature concerning the dehydrogenation reaction over supported vanadia systems."

[2] "The possibility of using oxide systems other than chromia is being explored in an effort to make the alkane-alkene conversion process more selective and stable."

[3] "Supported VOx catalysts have been extensively studied for the oxidative dehydrogenation of light alkanes [...]. They have also been explored in the dehydrogenation of light alkanes including propane and butane [...] and have shown promise to be both active and selective for the dehydrogenation reactions."

[4] "Studies on alumina supported catalysts with a range of vanadia weight loadings revealed [...] that isolated VOx species dominated at surface densities below 1 V/nm2; polyvanadates coexisted with monovanadates at surface densities between 1.2-4.4 V/nm2; and V2O5 formed at a surface density higher than 4.4 V/nm2."

[5] "At low loadings the +6 state is favored on alumina. On zirconia however Cr(V) was found to be ~50% of the chromium present [22]. As loading increases the surface species change from monochromate to polychromate to α-Cr2O3."

Several factors have driven the exploration of vanadium oxide-based catalysts as alternatives to Pt and CrOx for paraffin dehydrogenation:

1. The desire to improve selectivity and stability of the alkane-alkene conversion process.

2. The potential for vanadium oxide catalysts to be both active and selective for dehydrogenation reactions.

3. The extensive research on supported vanadium oxide systems for oxidative dehydrogenation of light alkanes, which has provided a foundation for exploring their use in direct dehydrogenation.

Research in this area has evolved since the 1980s by:

1. Expanding from oxidative dehydrogenation to direct dehydrogenation of light alkanes.

2. Investigating a wide range of support materials and metal loadings.

3. Developing a deeper understanding of the structure-function relationships in supported vanadium oxide catalysts.

Variables such as carrier type, support surface area, and metal loading influence the nature and behavior of vanadium species in these catalysts by:

1. Determining the oxidation state of vanadium (e.g., +6 state favored on alumina at low loadings).

2. Influencing the distribution of vanadium species (isolated VOx, polyvanadates, or V2O5) based on surface density.

3. Affecting the interaction between vanadium and the support, which can impact catalyst activity and selectivity.

4. Determining the dispersion and accessibility of active sites on the catalyst surface.

几个因素推动了对钒氧化物基催化剂作为Pt和CrOx的替代品用于烷烃脱氢的探索：

1. 希望提高烷烃-烯烃转化过程的选择性和稳定性。

2. 钒氧化物催化剂在脱氢反应中具有活性和选择性的潜力。

3. 对于轻烷烃氧化脱氢的负载钒氧化物体系的广泛研究，为探索其在直接脱氢中的应用奠定了基础。

自1980年代以来，该领域的研究已经发展：

1. 从氧化脱氢扩展到轻烷烃的直接脱氢。

2. 研究了广泛的载体材料和金属负载量。

3. 深入了解了负载钒氧化物催化剂的结构-功能关系。

载体类型、载体表面积和金属负载量等变量通过以下方式影响这些催化剂中钒物种的性质和行为：

1. 决定钒的氧化态（例如，在低负载量时铝氧化物上倾向于+6态）。

2. 根据表面密度影响钒物种的分布（孤立的VOx、多钒酸盐或V2O5）。

3. 影响钒与载体之间的相互作用，这可能影响催化剂的活性和选择性。

4. 决定催化剂表面活性位点的分散性和可及性。
