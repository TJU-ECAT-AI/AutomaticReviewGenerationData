[1] "Although vanadia catalysts have not been used commercially there is a significant literature concerning the dehydrogenation reaction over supported vanadia systems."

[2] "The possibility of using oxide systems other than chromia is being explored in an effort to make the alkane-alkene conversion process more selective and stable. Supported VOx catalysts have been extensively studied for the oxidative dehydrogenation of light alkanes [40, 54, 68-72]. They have also been explored in the dehydrogenation of light alkanes including propane and butane [35, 39, 73, 74] and have shown promise to be both active and selective for the dehydrogenation reactions."

[3] "Studies on alumina supported catalysts with a range of vanadia weight loadings revealed [63, 64] that isolated VOx species dominated at surface densities below 1 V/nm2; polyvanadates coexisted with monovanadates at surface densities between 1.2-4.4 V/nm2; and V2O5 formed at a surface density higher than 4.4 V/nm2."

[4] "At low butane partial pressure, TPO quantification results showed that the amount of coke formed in butane dehydrogenation follows the sequence: polymeric VOx > monomeric VOx > V2O5, Al2O3. However, at 1 bar butane pressure the order is changed slightly with V2O5 > polymeric VOx > monomeric VOx > Al2O3."

Factors driving exploration of vanadium oxide catalysts:

1. Desire to improve selectivity and stability of alkane-alkene conversion compared to chromia catalysts.

2. Potential for high activity and selectivity in dehydrogenation reactions.

3. Extensive research on VOx catalysts for oxidative dehydrogenation of light alkanes, which led to interest in non-oxidative dehydrogenation.

Evolution of research since 1980s:

1. Shift from studying mainly oxidative dehydrogenation to exploring non-oxidative dehydrogenation.

2. Increased focus on understanding the nature and structure of supported VOx species.

3. More detailed investigations into the relationship between catalyst structure and performance.

Influence of variables on vanadium species:

1. Metal loading affects the nature of VOx species:
   - Low loadings (<1 V/nm2): Isolated VOx species
   - Medium loadings (1.2-4.4 V/nm2): Mix of mono- and polyvanadates
   - High loadings (>4.4 V/nm2): Formation of V2O5

2. Support surface area likely influences the distribution and dispersion of VOx species.

3. Carrier type affects the reducibility and stability of VOx species.

4. These variables impact coke formation during reactions:
   - At low pressures: polymeric VOx > monomeric VOx > V2O5
   - At higher pressures: V2O5 > polymeric VOx > monomeric VOx

This research has contributed to a better understanding of the structure-function relationships in VOx catalysts for alkane dehydrogenation, though commercial application has not yet been realized.

推动钒氧化物催化剂研究的因素：

1. 希望改善烷烃-烯烃转化过程的选择性和稳定性，相比铬基催化剂。

2. 在脱氢反应中具有高活性和选择性的潜力。

3. 对轻烷烃氧化脱氢的VOx催化剂的广泛研究，引发了对非氧化脱氢的兴趣。

自1980年代以来研究的演变：

1. 从主要研究氧化脱氢转向探索非氧化脱氢。

2. 更加关注理解负载VOx物种的性质和结构。

3. 对催化剂结构和性能关系的更详细研究。

变量对钒物种的影响：

1. 金属负载量影响VOx物种的性质：
   - 低负载（<1 V/nm2）：分散的VOx物种
   - 中等负载（1.2-4.4 V/nm2）：单钒酸盐和多钒酸盐混合
   - 高负载（>4.4 V/nm2）：形成V2O5

2. 载体表面积可能影响VOx物种的分布和分散。

3. 载体类型影响VOx物种的可还原性和稳定性。

4. 这些变量影响反应过程中的积碳形成：
   - 低压条件下：多聚VOx > 单体VOx > V2O5
   - 高压条件下：V2O5 > 多聚VOx > 单体VOx

这些研究有助于更好地理解VOx催化剂在烷烃脱氢中的结构-功能关系，尽管尚未实现商业应用。
