What factors have driven the exploration of vanadium oxide-based catalysts as alternatives to Pt and CrOx for paraffin dehydrogenation, how has research in this area evolved since the 1980s, and how do variables such as carrier type, support surface area, and metal loading influence the nature and behavior of vanadium species in these catalysts?
