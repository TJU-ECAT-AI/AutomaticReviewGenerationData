[1] "Recently, several attempts have been made to use carbon dioxide as an oxidant for coupling of methane, dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene or propane."

[2] "Ga2O3 afforded the highest yield of ethene (18.6%) amongst the various metal oxide catalysts. However, little work has dealt with Ga2O3 catalyst in the dehydrogenation of propane."

[3] "As expected, Cr2O3 and V2O5 exhibited high activities. These catalysts are known to be active catalysts for dehydrogenation of alkanes."

The literature does not provide specific information addressing the evolution of research on vanadium oxide-based catalysts for paraffin dehydrogenation since the 1980s, nor does it discuss factors driving their exploration as alternatives to Pt and CrOx. The document also does not mention how variables like carrier type, support surface area, and metal loading influence vanadium species in these catalysts.

The text briefly mentions that V2O5 exhibits high activity for ethane dehydrogenation, along with Cr2O3, but does not provide further details about vanadium oxide catalysts specifically. The focus of the study is primarily on gallium oxide (Ga2O3) as a catalyst for ethane dehydrogenation in the presence of CO2.

该文献没有提供关于自1980年代以来钒氧化物基催化剂用于烷烃脱氢研究演变的具体信息，也没有讨论推动将其作为Pt和CrOx替代品探索的因素。文件也没有提到载体类型、支撑物表面积和金属负载等变量如何影响这些催化剂中钒物种的性质和行为。

文本简要提到V2O5与Cr2O3一起表现出较高的乙烷脱氢活性，但没有提供关于钒氧化物催化剂的更多细节。该研究主要关注氧化镓(Ga2O3)作为二氧化碳存在下乙烷脱氢的催化剂。
