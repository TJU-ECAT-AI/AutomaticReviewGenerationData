[1] "Recently, several attempts have been made to use carbon dioxide as an oxidant for coupling of methane, dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene or propane."

[2] "Ga2O3 afforded the highest yield of ethene (18.6%) amongst the various metal oxide catalysts. However, little work has dealt with Ga2O3 catalyst in the dehydrogenation of propane."

[3] "As expected, Cr2O3 and V2O5 exhibited high activities. These catalysts are known to be active catalysts for dehydrogenation of alkanes."

The document does not provide specific information about vanadium oxide-based catalysts as alternatives to Pt and CrOx for paraffin dehydrogenation, nor does it discuss the evolution of research in this area since the 1980s. The literature also does not mention variables such as carrier type, support surface area, and metal loading influencing the nature and behavior of vanadium species in these catalysts.

The document does mention that V2O5 exhibits high activity for the dehydrogenation of ethane, along with Cr2O3. However, it focuses more on the performance of Ga2O3 as a catalyst for ethane dehydrogenation in the presence of CO2, rather than providing a comprehensive overview of vanadium oxide-based catalysts.

该文档并未提供关于钒氧化物基催化剂作为铂和铬氧化物替代品用于烷烃脱氢的具体信息，也没有讨论自1980年代以来该领域研究的演变。文献也没有提到载体类型、支撑体表面积和金属负载量等变量如何影响这些催化剂中钒物种的性质和行为。

文档确实提到V2O5与Cr2O3一样，对乙烷脱氢表现出高活性。然而，它更多地关注Ga2O3在CO2存在下作为乙烷脱氢催化剂的性能，而不是提供钒氧化物基催化剂的全面概述。
