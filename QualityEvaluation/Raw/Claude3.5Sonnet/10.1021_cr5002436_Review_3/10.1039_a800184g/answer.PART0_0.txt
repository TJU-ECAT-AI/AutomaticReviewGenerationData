[1] "Recently, several attempts have been made to use carbon dioxide as an oxidant for coupling of methane,5 dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene6 or propane.7"

[2] "Cr2O3 and V2O5 exhibited high activities. These catalysts are known to be active catalysts for dehydrogenation of alkanes."

[3] "The effect of CO2 on the yield of ethane with V2O5 in the presence of CO2 was slightly detrimental."

The literature does not provide comprehensive information to fully answer the question about the evolution of research on vanadium oxide-based catalysts for paraffin dehydrogenation since the 1980s. The document only briefly mentions that V2O5 exhibits high activity and is known to be an active catalyst for alkane dehydrogenation. It does not discuss factors driving the exploration of vanadium oxide catalysts as alternatives to Pt and CrOx, nor does it provide details on how variables like carrier type, support surface area, and metal loading influence vanadium species behavior.

The text does note that carbon dioxide has been explored as an oxidant for various dehydrogenation reactions, including propane dehydrogenation. However, for V2O5 specifically, the presence of CO2 was found to be slightly detrimental to ethane yield.

Without more extensive information from other sources, it is not possible to provide a comprehensive answer about the evolution of vanadium oxide catalyst research for paraffin dehydrogenation since the 1980s or the influence of specific variables on catalyst behavior.

该文献并未提供全面的信息来完整回答关于自1980年代以来钒氧化物基催化剂用于烷烃脱氢的研究演变问题。文档仅简要提到V2O5表现出高活性，并且是已知的烷烃脱氢活性催化剂。它没有讨论推动探索钒氧化物催化剂作为Pt和CrOx替代品的因素，也没有提供诸如载体类型、支撑体表面积和金属负载量等变量如何影响钒物种行为的细节。

文本确实提到二氧化碳被探索用作各种脱氢反应的氧化剂，包括丙烷脱氢。然而，对于V2O5而言，CO2的存在对乙烷产率略有不利影响。

没有其他来源的更广泛信息，无法全面回答自1980年代以来钒氧化物催化剂研究的演变，或特定变量对催化剂行为影响的问题。
