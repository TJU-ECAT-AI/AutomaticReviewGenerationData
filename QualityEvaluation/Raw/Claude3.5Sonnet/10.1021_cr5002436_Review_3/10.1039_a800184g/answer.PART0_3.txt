[1] "As expected, Cr2O3 and V2O5 exhibited high activities. These catalysts are known to be active catalysts for dehydrogenation of alkanes."

[2] "The effect of CO2 on the yield of ethane with V2O5 in the presence of CO2 was slightly detrimental."

The literature does not provide sufficient information to fully answer the question about the evolution of vanadium oxide-based catalysts research since the 1980s or the influence of variables like carrier type, support surface area, and metal loading. The document only briefly mentions that V2O5 exhibits high activity for alkane dehydrogenation and that CO2 slightly decreased its effectiveness for ethane dehydrogenation. No details are provided about factors driving exploration of V2O5 catalysts as alternatives to Pt or CrOx, or how research in this area has developed over time.

该文献没有提供足够的信息来全面回答关于20世纪80年代以来钒氧化物催化剂研究的演变,或者载体类型、支撑表面积和金属负载等变量的影响。文档仅简要提到V2O5对烷烃脱氢表现出高活性,而CO2略微降低了其对乙烷脱氢的有效性。文中没有提供关于探索V2O5催化剂作为Pt或CrOx替代品的驱动因素,或者该领域的研究如何随时间发展的详细信息。
