The given literature does not contain any information specifically addressing vanadium oxide-based catalysts as alternatives to Pt and CrOx for paraffin dehydrogenation, nor does it discuss how research in this area has evolved since the 1980s. The document also does not mention how variables such as carrier type, support surface area, and metal loading influence the nature and behavior of vanadium species in these catalysts. The text primarily focuses on the general importance of vanadium in heterogeneous catalysis, its discovery, and some industrial applications, but does not delve into the specific topic of paraffin dehydrogenation catalysts.

给定的文献中没有特别提到钒氧化物基催化剂作为铂和铬氧化物在烷烃脱氢中的替代品,也没有讨论自1980年代以来这一领域的研究如何发展。文档也没有提到载体类型、支撑体表面积和金属负载量等变量如何影响这些催化剂中钒物种的性质和行为。该文本主要关注钒在多相催化中的一般重要性、它的发现以及一些工业应用,但没有深入探讨烷烃脱氢催化剂的具体话题。
