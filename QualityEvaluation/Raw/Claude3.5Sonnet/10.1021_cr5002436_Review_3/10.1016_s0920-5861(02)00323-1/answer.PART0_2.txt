The given literature does not contain any information specifically addressing vanadium oxide-based catalysts as alternatives to Pt and CrOx for paraffin dehydrogenation, nor does it discuss how research in this area has evolved since the 1980s. The document also does not mention how variables such as carrier type, support surface area, and metal loading influence the nature and behavior of vanadium species in these catalysts. The literature primarily focuses on the general importance of vanadium in catalysis, its discovery, and some industrial applications, but does not cover the specific topic of paraffin dehydrogenation catalysts.

所提供的文献中没有具体涉及钒氧化物基催化剂作为铂和铬氧化物在烷烃脱氢反应中的替代品,也没有讨论自1980年代以来该领域的研究是如何发展的。文献也没有提到载体类型、载体表面积和金属负载量等变量如何影响这些催化剂中钒物种的性质和行为。该文献主要关注钒在催化领域的一般重要性、其发现历史以及一些工业应用,但没有涉及烷烃脱氢催化剂这一特定主题。
