[1] "Catalytic dehydrogenation of light alkanes is a highly important route for the production of olefins, which are the building blocks of synthetic rubbers, plastics, automotive fuel components, and other valuable chemical products. Industrial chemical processes use chromia- or platinum-based catalysts generally supported on alumina and promoted with alkali metals [1–3]."

[2] "Numerous studies on the improvement of existing catalysts and the development of vanadia-based dehydrogenation catalysts have been reported [6–10]."

[3] "It is generally accepted that supported vanadium oxide can exist as isolated monomeric vanadia species, one- or two-dimensional polyvanadate domains, or bulk V2O5 crystallites. At low vanadium coverage on the support, isolated monovanadates are the predominant surface species; these condense into polyvanadates and ultimately into bulk V2O5 crystallites as VOx loading increases."

[4] "Earlier studies on 1 and 3.5% V on alumina showed that isolated VOx species are much more effective than polyvanadate species at catalysing carbon deposition during butane dehydrogenation. It also has been observed that polyvanadate species are more effective than isolated vanadia species in dehydrogenation [23]."

Factors driving the exploration of vanadium oxide-based catalysts for paraffin dehydrogenation include:

1. The importance of olefin production from light alkanes for various industrial applications.

2. The need to improve upon existing chromia- and platinum-based catalysts.

3. The potential for vanadia-based catalysts to offer improved performance.

Research in this area has evolved since the 1980s by focusing on:

1. Developing and improving vanadia-based catalysts.

2. Understanding the different forms of supported vanadium oxide (monomeric, polyvanadate, and bulk V2O5).

3. Investigating the relationship between vanadia species and catalytic performance.

Variables influencing the nature and behavior of vanadium species in these catalysts include:

1. Vanadium loading: Higher loadings lead to the formation of polyvanadates and bulk V2O5.

2. Support surface area: This affects the dispersion and distribution of vanadium species.

3. Carrier type: The support material influences the interaction with vanadium species.

These variables impact the catalytic performance, with polyvanadate species generally being more effective for dehydrogenation, while isolated species tend to catalyze carbon deposition more readily.

推动探索钒氧化物基催化剂作为烷烃脱氢替代铂和氧化铬催化剂的因素包括：

1. 从轻烷烃生产烯烃对各种工业应用的重要性。

2. 需要改进现有的铬基和铂基催化剂。

3. 钒基催化剂可能提供更好性能的潜力。

自1980年代以来，该领域的研究发展主要集中在：

1. 开发和改进钒基催化剂。

2. 了解负载钒氧化物的不同形式（单体、多钒酸盐和块状V2O5）。

3. 研究钒物种与催化性能之间的关系。

影响这些催化剂中钒物种性质和行为的变量包括：

1. 钒负载量：更高的负载量导致多钒酸盐和块状V2O5的形成。

2. 载体表面积：这影响钒物种的分散和分布。

3. 载体类型：支撑材料影响与钒物种的相互作用。

这些变量影响催化性能，多钒酸盐物种通常对脱氢更有效，而单体物种往往更容易催化碳沉积。
