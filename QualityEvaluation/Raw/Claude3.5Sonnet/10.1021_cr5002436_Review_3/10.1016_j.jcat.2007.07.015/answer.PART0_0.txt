[1] "Numerous studies on the improvement of existing catalysts and the development of vanadia-based dehydrogenation catalysts have been reported [610]."

[2] "Alumina-supported vanadia has been extensively studied over the last few years, with the activity and selectivity of vanadia-supported catalysts modified by the structural and physicochemical properties of the dispersed species supported on the surface [1115]."

[3] "It is generally accepted that supported vanadium oxide can exist as isolated monomeric vanadia species, one- or two-dimensional polyvanadate domains, or bulk V2O5 crystallites. At low vanadium coverage on the support, isolated monovanadates are the predominant surface species; these condense into polyvanadates and ultimately into bulk V2O5 crystallites as VOx loading increases."

[4] "The extent of this effect depends on the nature of the support and has been studied in detail using XANES, Raman, and UVvisible spectroscopic studies [16]. Silica-supported vanadia is highly susceptible to structural changes on exposure to water at room temperature. Water has little effect on VOx/Al2O3 and VOx/TiO2 structure at room temperature, but at high temperature its effect on the surface structure becomes significant [17]."

The exploration of vanadium oxide-based catalysts as alternatives to Pt and CrOx for paraffin dehydrogenation has been driven by the need to improve existing catalysts and develop more efficient dehydrogenation processes. Research in this area has evolved significantly since the 1980s, with numerous studies focusing on the development and improvement of vanadia-based catalysts.

The nature and behavior of vanadium species in these catalysts are influenced by several variables:

1. Carrier type: Different supports (e.g., alumina, silica, titania) affect the structure and properties of the supported vanadia species. For example, silica-supported vanadia is more susceptible to structural changes when exposed to water compared to alumina or titania-supported vanadia.

2. Support surface area: This factor affects the dispersion of vanadium species on the surface.

3. Metal loading: The concentration of vanadium on the support influences the type of vanadium species formed. At low loadings, isolated monomeric vanadia species dominate, while at higher loadings, these condense into polyvanadates and eventually form bulk V2O5 crystallites.

These variables play a crucial role in determining the structural and physicochemical properties of the dispersed vanadium species on the support surface, which in turn affect the activity and selectivity of the catalysts. Researchers have extensively studied these factors using various spectroscopic techniques such as XANES, Raman, and UV-visible spectroscopy to better understand the structure-activity relationships in vanadia-based catalysts.

钒氧化物基催化剂作为烷烃脱氢反应中铂和氧化铬催化剂的替代品的研究，主要是由于需要改进现有催化剂并开发更高效的脱氢工艺。自20世纪80年代以来，这一领域的研究已经取得了显著进展，有大量研究集中在钒基催化剂的开发和改进上。

这些催化剂中钒物种的性质和行为受到几个变量的影响：

1. 载体类型：不同的载体（如氧化铝、二氧化硅、二氧化钛）会影响负载的钒物种的结构和性质。例如，与氧化铝或二氧化钛负载的钒相比，二氧化硅负载的钒在暴露于水中时更容易发生结构变化。

2. 载体表面积：这个因素影响钒物种在表面的分散程度。

3. 金属负载量：载体上钒的浓度影响形成的钒物种类型。在低负载量时，以孤立的单体钒物种为主，而在高负载量时，这些物种会凝聚成多钒酸盐，最终形成体相的V2O5晶体。

这些变量在决定载体表面上分散的钒物种的结构和物理化学性质方面起着至关重要的作用，进而影响催化剂的活性和选择性。研究人员已经使用各种光谱技术，如XANES、拉曼和紫外-可见光谱，对这些因素进行了广泛研究，以更好地理解钒基催化剂中的结构-活性关系。
