[1] "Numerous studies on the improvement of existing catalysts and the development of vanadia-based dehydrogenation catalysts have been reported [6–10]."

[2] "Alumina-supported vanadia has been extensively studied over the last few years, with the activity and selectivity of vanadia-supported catalysts modified by the structural and physicochemical properties of the dispersed species supported on the surface [11–15]."

[3] "It is generally accepted that supported vanadium oxide can exist as isolated monomeric vanadia species, one- or two-dimensional polyvanadate domains, or bulk V2O5 crystallites. At low vanadium coverage on the support, isolated monovanadates are the predominant surface species; these condense into polyvanadates and ultimately into bulk V2O5 crystallites as VOx loading increases."

[4] "A decrease in BET surface area with higher metal loadings was generally observed and could be related to the blockage of pores by the VOx species."

The exploration of vanadium oxide-based catalysts as alternatives to Pt and CrOx for paraffin dehydrogenation has been driven by several factors:

1. The need to improve existing catalysts and develop new ones for dehydrogenation reactions.

2. The potential of vanadia-based catalysts to offer improved activity and selectivity compared to traditional catalysts.

Research in this area has evolved significantly since the 1980s, with extensive studies on alumina-supported vanadia catalysts over the last few years. The focus has been on understanding and modifying the structural and physicochemical properties of dispersed vanadia species on the support surface to enhance catalytic performance.

Variables such as carrier type, support surface area, and metal loading influence the nature and behavior of vanadium species in these catalysts in the following ways:

1. Metal loading: As vanadium loading increases, the nature of surface species changes from isolated monomeric vanadia to polyvanadate domains and eventually to bulk V2O5 crystallites.

2. Support surface area: Higher metal loadings generally lead to a decrease in BET surface area, likely due to pore blockage by VOx species.

3. Carrier type: While not explicitly mentioned in the given text, the choice of carrier (support material) can affect the dispersion and interaction of vanadium species with the support surface.

These variables play a crucial role in determining the catalytic activity, selectivity, and stability of vanadium oxide-based catalysts for paraffin dehydrogenation reactions.

钒氧化物基催化剂作为烷烃脱氢反应中铂和氧化铬催化剂的替代品的探索受到以下因素的推动：

1. 改进现有催化剂并开发新型脱氢催化剂的需求。

2. 钒基催化剂有潜力提供比传统催化剂更高的活性和选择性。

自20世纪80年代以来，该领域的研究已显著发展，近年来对氧化铝负载的钒催化剂进行了广泛研究。研究重点是理解和修改分散在支撑表面上的钒物种的结构和物理化学性质，以提高催化性能。

载体类型、支撑表面积和金属负载量等变量以下列方式影响这些催化剂中钒物种的性质和行为：

1. 金属负载量：随着钒负载量的增加，表面物种的性质从孤立的单体钒氧化物变为多钒氧化物结构，最终形成块状V2O5晶体。

2. 支撑表面积：较高的金属负载量通常导致BET比表面积减小，可能是由于VOx物种堵塞孔隙所致。

3. 载体类型：虽然在给定文本中没有明确提及，但载体（支撑材料）的选择可能会影响钒物种与支撑表面的分散和相互作用。

这些变量在决定钒氧化物基催化剂用于烷烃脱氢反应的催化活性、选择性和稳定性方面起着至关重要的作用。
