[1] "Numerous studies on the improvement of existing catalysts and the development of vanadia-based dehydrogenation catalysts have been reported [610]."

[2] "Alumina-supported vanadia has been extensively studied over the last few years, with the activity and selectivity of vanadia-supported catalysts modified by the structural and physicochemical properties of the dispersed species supported on the surface [1115]."

[3] "It is generally accepted that supported vanadium oxide can exist as isolated monomeric vanadia species, one- or two-dimensional polyvanadate domains, or bulk V2O5 crystallites. At low vanadium coverage on the support, isolated monovanadates are the predominant surface species; these condense into polyvanadates and ultimately into bulk V2O5 crystallites as VOx loading increases."

[4] "Earlier studies on 1 and 3.5% V on alumina showed that isolated VOx species are much more effective than polyvanadate species at catalysing carbon deposition during butane dehydrogenation. It also has been observed that polyvanadate species are more effective than isolated vanadia species in dehydrogenation [23]."

Research into vanadium oxide-based catalysts for paraffin dehydrogenation has been driven by the need to improve existing catalysts and develop alternatives to platinum and chromium oxide catalysts. Since the 1980s, this research area has evolved significantly, with numerous studies focusing on alumina-supported vanadia catalysts.

The nature and behavior of vanadium species in these catalysts are heavily influenced by factors such as the type of carrier, support surface area, and metal loading. At low vanadium coverage, isolated monomeric vanadia species dominate. As the loading increases, these condense into polyvanadate domains and eventually form bulk V2O5 crystallites.

The type of vanadium species present affects catalyst performance. Isolated VOx species are more effective at catalyzing carbon deposition, while polyvanadate species are more effective for dehydrogenation. This suggests that optimizing the distribution of vanadium species is crucial for developing effective dehydrogenation catalysts.

The extensive research in this area over the past few decades has led to a deeper understanding of how the structural and physicochemical properties of dispersed vanadia species on the support surface influence catalyst activity and selectivity. This knowledge has been instrumental in guiding the development of improved vanadia-based dehydrogenation catalysts.

对烷烃脱氢用钒氧化物基催化剂的研究，源于改进现有催化剂和开发铂和氧化铬催化剂替代品的需求。自20世纪80年代以来，这一研究领域发展显著，众多研究集中在氧化铝负载的钒催化剂上。

这些催化剂中钒物种的性质和行为受到载体类型、支撑体表面积和金属负载量等因素的显著影响。在低钒覆盖率下，以孤立的单体钒氧化物为主。随着负载量增加，这些物种凝聚成多钒氧化物结构，最终形成块状V2O5晶体。

存在的钒物种类型影响催化剂性能。孤立的VOx物种更有效地催化碳沉积，而多钒氧化物物种在脱氢反应中更有效。这表明优化钒物种分布对开发有效的脱氢催化剂至关重要。

过去几十年在这一领域的广泛研究，使人们更深入地理解了分散在支撑体表面的钒氧化物物种的结构和物理化学性质如何影响催化剂的活性和选择性。这些知识对指导改进的钒基脱氢催化剂的开发起到了重要作用。
