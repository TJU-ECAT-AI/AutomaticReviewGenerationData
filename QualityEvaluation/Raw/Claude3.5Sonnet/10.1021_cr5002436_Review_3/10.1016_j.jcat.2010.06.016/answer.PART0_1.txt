This document does not contain any information about vanadium oxide-based catalysts for paraffin dehydrogenation. The literature focuses on platinum-based catalysts, specifically Pt/Mg(Ga)(Al)O catalysts, for ethane and propane dehydrogenation. It does not discuss vanadium oxide catalysts or their development since the 1980s. The document also does not mention variables like carrier type, support surface area, or metal loading in relation to vanadium species. The question cannot be answered based on the information provided in this literature.
