The systematic study of B-based catalysts for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) enhances our understanding of catalytic processes by providing insights into the catalytic mechanisms of tricoordinated B species with different dimensional geometric configurations. This deeper understanding of the active sites and their roles in both surface and gas-phase reactions has significant implications for developing more efficient ODHP catalysts in the future.

The study emphasizes the importance of spatial configuration and dispersion of active sites, as well as the synergy between surface catalytic cycles and gas-phase reactions. This knowledge is crucial for optimizing catalyst design and performance, particularly in reactions dominated by radical pathways like ODHP.

By addressing key issues in B-based catalyst development, such as the conversion-selectivity trade-off, radical initiation ability, and catalyst stability, future research can potentially improve catalytic performances of B-based materials. This, in turn, may lead to new opportunities for the practical application of oxidative dehydrogenation techniques in the production of low olefins, which is of significant industrial importance.

对丙烷氧化脱氢(ODHP)用B基催化剂的系统研究通过提供对不同维度几何构型的三配位B物种的催化机理的见解，加深了我们对催化过程的理解。这种对活性位点及其在表面和气相反应中作用的深入理解，对未来开发更高效的ODHP催化剂具有重要意义。

该研究强调了活性位点的空间构型和分散性，以及表面催化循环和气相反应之间协同作用的重要性。这些知识对于优化催化剂设计和性能至关重要，特别是在像ODHP这样由自由基途径主导的反应中。

通过解决B基催化剂开发中的关键问题，如转化率-选择性权衡、自由基引发能力和催化剂稳定性等，未来的研究有可能改善B基材料的催化性能。这反过来可能为氧化脱氢技术在低烯烃生产中的实际应用开辟新的机会，这在工业上具有重要意义。
