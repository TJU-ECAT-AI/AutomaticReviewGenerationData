          [1] "It was recognized that the catalytic mechanisms on the potential active sites of tricoordination B species with different dimensional geometric configurations deepened the understanding of B-based catalysts for propane dehydrogenation and provided effective guidance for the development of more efficient ODHP catalysts in the future."

          [2] "As a reaction dominated by the radical pathway, the spatial configuration and dispersion of the active sites and synergism of the surface catalytic cycles and gas-phase reactions are highly important for catalyst design and performance optimization."

          [3] "Currently, although methods to construct different configurations of active sites have been well developed, some technical problems still exist that restrict the further development of B-based catalysts:"

          [4] "Studies on these important problems in the future will promote the catalytic performances of B-based materials and open up new opportunities for the practical application of oxidative dehydrogenation techniques for the production of low olefins."

          The systematic study of B-based catalysts for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) enhances our understanding of catalytic processes by providing insights into the catalytic mechanisms of tricoordinated B species with different dimensional geometric configurations. This deeper understanding of B-based catalysts for propane dehydrogenation offers effective guidance for developing more efficient ODHP catalysts in the future.

          The study emphasizes the importance of the spatial configuration and dispersion of active sites, as well as the synergism between surface catalytic cycles and gas-phase reactions. These factors are crucial for catalyst design and performance optimization, particularly in reactions dominated by radical pathways like ODHP.

          However, the research also identifies several technical problems that currently restrict the further development of B-based catalysts. These challenges include the conversion-selectivity trade-off, limited radical initiation ability at low temperatures, the role of B-based catalysts in terminating active radicals, insufficient understanding of gas-phase radical reaction mechanisms, and issues with catalyst stability and boric acid leaching.

          The implications of this research for developing more efficient ODHP catalysts are significant. By addressing these challenges and focusing on the key aspects of catalyst design, such as the spatial configuration of active sites and the interplay between surface and gas-phase reactions, researchers can potentially improve the catalytic performance of B-based materials. This progress may lead to new opportunities for the practical application of oxidative dehydrogenation techniques in the production of low olefins, which is an important industrial process.

          对丙烷氧化脱氢(ODHP)中B基催化剂的系统研究通过提供具有不同维度几何构型的三配位B物种的催化机理见解，增进了我们对催化过程的理解。这种对丙烷脱氢B基催化剂的深入理解为未来开发更高效的ODHP催化剂提供了有效指导。

          研究强调了活性位点的空间构型和分散性，以及表面催化循环和气相反应之间协同作用的重要性。这些因素对催化剂设计和性能优化至关重要，特别是在像ODHP这样由自由基途径主导的反应中。

          然而，研究也识别出了几个目前限制B基催化剂进一步发展的技术问题。这些挑战包括转化率-选择性权衡关系、低温下有限的自由基引发能力、B基催化剂在终止活性自由基中的作用、对气相自由基反应机理的理解不足，以及催化剂稳定性和硼酸浸出的问题。

          这项研究对开发更高效ODHP催化剂的影响是显著的。通过解决这些挑战并专注于催化剂设计的关键方面，如活性位点的空间构型以及表面和气相反应之间的相互作用，研究人员有可能提高B基材料的催化性能。这一进展可能为氧化脱氢技术在低烯烃生产中的实际应用开辟新的机会，这是一个重要的工业过程。
