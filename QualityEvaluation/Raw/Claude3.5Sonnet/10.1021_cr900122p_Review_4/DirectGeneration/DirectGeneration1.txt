Intramolecular C-H bond activation plays a crucial role in the deactivation of supported alkene polymerization and metathesis catalysts, particularly in lanthanide/actinide-based and silica-supported Re-based systems. This process involves the cleavage of a carbon-hydrogen bond within the catalyst molecule, leading to structural changes that compromise its catalytic activity. In lanthanide and actinide catalysts, the highly electropositive metal centers can facilitate this activation, resulting in the formation of stable metal-hydride or metal-alkyl species. Similarly, in silica-supported Re-based systems, the rhenium center can interact with nearby C-H bonds, potentially forming metallacyclic structures. These transformations often lead to catalyst deactivation by altering the active site geometry or electronic properties. Consequently, understanding these mechanisms is crucial for designing more stable and efficient catalysts, as well as for optimizing reaction conditions to minimize deactivation. The study of these processes also provides valuable insights into fundamental organometallic chemistry and surface science, contributing to the broader field of heterogeneous catalysis.
