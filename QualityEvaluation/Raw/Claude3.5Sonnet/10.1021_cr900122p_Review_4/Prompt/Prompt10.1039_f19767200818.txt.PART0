Exchange Reactions of Benzene and Alkylbenzenes with 
Deuterium on Alumina and Magnesium Oxide

Received 31st July, 1975 
Some hydrogen-deuterium exchange reactions of benzene and alkylbenzenes on y-alumina and 
magnesium oxide have been investigated. On alumina, benzene and toluene, both separately and 
together, have been exchanged with deuterium. In addition cross exchange between light toluene 
heavy benzene has been studied. The intermolecular redistribution of deuterium in [a-2H3]-toluene 
and [aa-ZH6]-p-xylene 
has also been followed. Similar reactions have been performed using mag- 
nesium oxide. 
The results are discussed and probable mechanisms for the reactions proposed. 
Studies of the exchange reactions of aromatic molecules have often been under- 
taken in an attempt to characterise the catalytic properties of metal oxide.l- 
Of 
particular interest are the reactions of alkylbenzenes since these molecules possess 
more than one type of hydrogen atom each of which may undergo exchange at a 
different 
rate or in a different manner depending upon the nature of the catalyst used. 
The present work has been carried out using y-alumina and magnesium oxide. 
Some results for the exchange of benzene and toluene on alumina have been reported 
previously but the exact structural nature of the catalyst used is not clear.2 Saunders 
and Hightower have found evidence for the participation of dissociatively adsorbed 
benzene in the exchange reaction of that molecule on alumina. Intermolecular 
redistribution of deuterium and hydrogen between benzene molecules was more rapid 
than the exchange between benzene and deuterium itself. The work described here 
was aimed at learning more about the reaction mechanisms by which aromatic 
molecules undergo exchange on alumina. We also wished to know whether the 
linear relationship between the ease of exchange of hydrocarbons and their acidity 
found for alkanes 5 9  
and probably applicable to alkenes 6 ,  could be extended to 
include the reactions of aromatic compounds. 
The exchange of alkanes and alkenes with deuterium on magnesium oxide appears 
to involve intermediates with carbanionic character similar to those found for 
alumina. 
We wished to know if such a similarity in behaviour would be observed 
when alkylbenzenes were used. No previous accounts of the exchange reactions of 
aromatic molecdes on magnesium oxide appear to have been published. 
The investigations were carried out using three types of experiments : (a) 
ordinary 
exchange of light hydrocarbon with deuterium as D2, (b) cross exchange which 
involved the reaction between a light hydrocarbon and a labelled reactant (in this case 
[2H6]-benzene) 
and (c) redistribution reactions in which the scrambling of deuterium 
initially located in the side groups of selectively labelled alkylbenzenes was followed.

EXPERIMENTAL 
A P P A R A T U S  
Two types of equipment were used. For those reactions in which a single hydrocarbon 
underwent exchange the apparatus used was essentially that described before. 
A Pyrex 
reaction vessel (volume - 2 . 0   
m3) was connected via a capillary leak to an A.E.I. 
MSlO mass spectrometer. Ionizing electrons at 13 eV were used for the analysis. For 
those cases where more than one hydrocar3on was used, the individual components were 
separated and analysed for isotopic content with a combined gas chromatograph-mass 
spetrometer. 
lo The column used for the separation of benzene and toluene consisted 
of 4 
m Silicone Fluid (11.5%) and Bentone 34 (11.5%) on 80-100 Chromosorb W (Perkin- 
Elmer Ltd.). The column was operated at 383 K with helium as carrier gas. In order to 
minimise peak tailing, the molecular separator and inlet capillaries were heated to -323 K. 
Mass spectra were measured using ionizing electrons at 20 eV. 
MATERIALS 
Details of the catalysts and of the deuterium and oxygen used are provided elewhere. 
All the hydrocarbons used were of high purity. [2H6]-Benzene 
contained 99.5 atom % D. 
[t-H,]-Toluene 
contained 
93 % 
of the 2[H3]-isomer 
and the [2H6]-isomer 
in [at-H]-p-xylene 
was present to the extent of 99 %. The hydrocarbons were distilled from traps held in liquid 
nitrogen and carefully outgassed before being admitted to the reaction vessel. 
PROCEDURE 
The alumina and magnesium oxide catalysts were pretreated in the manner described 
elewhere. 
Fresh samples (0.1 g) were used for each experiment. After outgassing was 
complete the reactant hydrocarbon was frozen into the reaction vessel using liquid nitrogen. 
Deuterium was then added in the required quantity and the vessel warmed to the desired 
temperature. For those reactions involving the exchange of a single hydrocarbon with 
deuterium from D2 the amount of hydrocarbon used was in the range 2.4-3.1 
1019 
molecules. The ID2 :hydrocarbon ratio was in the range 25 :1 to 35 :l. When toluene and 
benzene were exchanged simultaneously with deuterium (D2) 
1.7 x lo1 molecules of each 
hydrocarbon were used and the D2 
:hydrocarbon ratio was 30 :l. The cross exchange of 
toluene with deuterium from [2H6]-benzene 
was studied 
using 1 . 7   
10 molecules of toluene 
and 5.1 
x lo1 molecules of the labelled reactant. Finally, the redistribution reactions of 
[2H3]-toluene 
and [2H6]-p-xylene 
were carried out with 8.5 x 1019 
molecules of reactant and 
no hydrogen phase present. 
TREATMENT OF RESULTS 
Mass spectra were corrected 
for the presence of background peaks, for naturally occurring 
deuterium and  
heavy  
carbon and for fragmentation of the hydrocarbon molecules in the 
spectrometer source. Fragmentation patterns were measured at regular intervals. For 
toluene and benzene, both light and perdeutero material were available and fragmentation 
corrections were performed using the method of Gault and Kemball.ll The fragmentation 
pattern of [2Hlo]-p-xylene 
was estimated using data for the light molecule and the empirical 
factor given by Dowie et a1.l2 Correction was then carried out as for benzene and toluene. 
For the reactions studied these methods of data correction proved satisfactory and it was 
not necessary to adopt the more sophisticated approach devised by Dowie et aZ.12 
In the exchange 
reactions 
where deuterium or [2H&benZene were used, standard methods 
were employed for the calculation of rate constants. When all the hydrogens of the reactant 
hydrocarbon underwent exchange at the same rate, the initial rate of deuterium entry (k4) 
and rate of loss of the light isomer (k,) were determined following the method of Kemball.13 
Values of the parameter 
M ( =  k4/ko) 
were calculated to assess the extent of multiple 
exchange. 
Where different types of hydrogen atoms were replaced at unequal rates, the approach of 
Harper, Siege1 and Kemball l4 
was adopted in order to measure rates of reaction for each

distinguishable group. The ratios of rate constants found were sufficiently high for this 
method to be succesful. 
For the redistribution reactions of toluene and xylene, rate equations analogous to those 
given by Kemball l3 
were used. For CsH5CD3 
as reactant an extent of reaction, a, was 
defined as 
3 
8 
a = 
(3-i)di+ 
(i-3)di. 
Rates for redistribution (k,) were calculated from the slope of a plot of In(a,-a) against 
time. The value of a, was calculated from the equilibrium isotopic distribution of the 
deuterium present in the reactant. Similarly a rate for the loss of [2H3]-toluene 
(kd) was 
calculated from a plot of h(d3-d3,) 
against time. The value of d3, was obtained from 
the same equilibrium isotopic distribution used for the calculation of a

.
 
The extent of 
multiple exchange in the redistribution reaction was given by the ratio k,/kd. 
Corresponding equations were used to analyse data for the reaction of labelled p-xylene,

A comparison of the distribution of isotopic toluenes with the calculated distri- 
bution for eight equivalent hydrogen atoms showed marked deviations (table l), and 
the results indicated that five hydrogens (group A) reacted more rapidly than the 
other three (group B); at 333 K kA/kB 
was just over 300. The rate of exchange of 
the group A hydrogens was higher by a factor of about 5 at 293 K when ['H6]-benzene 
was used instead of Dz, but the rate of replacement of those in group B remained 
the same. 
When benzene and toluene underwent exchange simultaneously with D2, 
rates of 
reaction were lower than those found for the individual exchange experiments. The 
initial rate of exchange of benzene at 273 K was slower than that of toluene. On 
raising the temperature to 296 K the deuterium content of the benzene gradually

became similar to that of the toluene ; 
thereafter both molecules underwent exchange 
at equal rates. 
The redistribution of deuterium in labelled toluene was five times faster than the 
exchange of the group B hydrogens with either deuterium or heavy benzene, but much 
slower than the exchange of the group A hydrogens.

REACTIONS O N  MAGNESIUM OXIDE 
The results for reactions on magnesium oxide are shown in fig. 2. The striking 
feature is the closely similar rates and activation energies found for both exchange 
and redistribution processes. The absolute rate constants were about the same as 
those found for the fastest reactions on alumina. In contrast to the behaviour of 
alumina, steady poisoning of magnesium oxide was apparent during some experi- 
ments, and was particularly severe at temperatures above 350 K.

DISCUSSION 
REACTIONS O N  ALUMINA 
The rate and activation energy of exchange for benzene with D2 
found in this work 
are very close to those reported by Saunders and Hightwer. 
Like them we find 
that our catalyst is about 100 times more active than that used by McCosh and

ALKYLBENZENE EXCHANGE O N  OXIDES 
KembalL2 However, we confirm the observations of the latter workers concerning 
the relative rates of replacement of the ring and side group hydrogens in toluene. 
The higher exchange rate of the ring atoms is in contrast to the situation found for 
the reactions of alkylbenzenes 
on metals2 On these catalysts the side group positions 
are more reactive and this is consistent with the view that radical intermediates are 
involved since the carbon-hydrogen bonds of the side groups are substantially weaker 
than those in the ring.16 Thus the results obtained for alumina suggest that radical- 
like intermediates are not involved in the exchange reactions. 
The participation of carbonium ions also seems unlikely. An associative 
mechanism involving the attack of a Df ion would require the presence of sites having 
considerable Bransted acidity ; such sites are not typically found on y-alumina. 
Moreover the isotope effects observed by Saunders and Hightower 
support a 
dissociative mechanism for the exchange of ring hydrogens. A dissociative step 
involving the formation of carbonium ions would involve the loss of H-, with the 
exchange proceeding by the subsequent gain of D-. The observed ease of exchange 
of ring positions is not consistent with the participation of nucleophilic hydrogen 
species since there is evidence that this type of hydrogen possesses a rather low 
activity at the temperatures used in this 
Previous investigations of the exchange of alkanes and cycloalkanes with D2 on 
y-alumina have shown that the ease of replacement of a given hydrogen atom is 
governed by its acidity.6 For cyclic molecules a linear relationship was found and 
may be expressed as 
(1) 
l7 
log k,+ = - 
O.38(pKa) + 
29.5 
where k+ 
represents the rate of exchange at 289 K. Taking the pK, value for benzene 
as 37,16 eqn (1) predicts a value for k4 of 2.8 x 1015 molecules s-l m-2. 
The agree- 
ment between this and the observed value of 3.3 x 1015 
molecules s-l m-2 is very 
close and provides some evidence for the participation of intermediates with carban- 
ionic character in the exchange of ring hydrogens in alkylbenzenes. The heterolytic 
dissociation of a ring C-H 
bond with loss of Hf to the catalyst surface is seen as the 
dominant rate-determining step ; this view is consistent with the isotope effects 
mentioned above. The Hf is likely to be adsorbed at an adjacent oxide ion where 
exchange with deuterium can occur to produce a surface D+ species which acts as 
the reactive form of the labelling isotope. The exchange reaction between M2 
and 
D2 
occurs rapidly on the catalyst although the presence of aromatic molecules reduces 
the rate of this reaction by at least three orders of magnitude 
and this reduction 
influences the overall rate of exchange of the alkylbenzene with deuterium. 
Although the reactivity of ring hydrogens may be explained in terms of acidity 
this approach cannot be applied to the side-group positions. The methyl hydrogens 
of toluene are about 100 times more acidic than those in benzene.l* Fig. 1 shows 
that the former are less active by a factor of about 1 000. This is a remarkable result 
in view of the wide applicability of the acidity-reactivity relationship which has been 
demonstrated. The high acidity associated with the methyl hydrogens of toluene is 
attributable to the considerable stabilization of the benzyl carbanion afforded by the 
delocalization of the negative charge on the a-carbon atom through the n-system of 
the ring. It is possible that on alumina the n-system is disrupted or even completely 
absent. Extensive n-bonding interaction with the adsorption centres (possibly 
exposed A13+ ions) might account for such behaviour. In the limit, the methyl 
hydrogens would be no more acidic than those in the methyl groups of alkanes and, 
indeed, their observed rate of exchange is very close to that found for methane and 
ethane on the same catalyst.6 Attractive though this argument appears, it is not

823 
entirely consistent with the rest of the results obtained. For example, if n-bonding 
occurred to such an extent in the adsorbed alkylbenzenes, then benzene would 
undoubtedly exhibit similar behaviour. The close agreement between the observed 
rate of exchange of the latter molecule and that predicted by the acidity of the 
hydrogens suggests that such drastic electronic distortion of the n-system does not 
in fact occur. However, a degree of n-bonding appears to be responsible for the 
poisoning effect of benzene on the H2-D2 equilibration reaction on alumina and so 
cannot be ruled out comp1etel;i. 
The low activity of the methyl hydrogens of toluene might be due to steric rather 
than electronic effects. It may b
:
:
 that the arrangement of surface sites on y-alumina 
is such that the ring hydrogens are preferentially dissociated and more readily 
exchanged. A small degree of n-interaction between the aromatic ring and exposed 
sites (A13+ 
ions?) might be sufficient ta hold the adsorbed molecule in a configuration 
such that adjacent cation-anion pairs are ideally placed to facilitate heterolytic 
dissociation of the carbon-hydrogen bonds of the ring, but not in a position to bring 
about dissociation of those in the side-group. The exchange of the hydrogens in the 
latter would only take place at higher tempLratures at which sufficient of the adsorbed 
material was in the appropriate, but less stable, orientation required for side-group 
exchange. Such an explanation is necessarily speculative but is supported by infrared 
spectroscipic studies which clearly demonstrate that the surface hydroxyl groups of 
y-alumina interact preferentially with the aromatic: 
nucleus of the toluene molecule. 
The lack of correlation between the relative exchmge activity of different hydrogen 
atoms in the same molecule and acidity has been observed in one other case on 
alumina. Studies of the exchange of propene with deuterium indicate that the more 
acidic methyl hydrogens are not the most reactive, entry of deuterium into the vinylic 
positions being preferred. 
2o 
The slightly lower activity for exchange displayed by toluene with deuterium in 
comparison with benzene is attributed to the inductive effect of the methyl group in 
the former molecule, which tends to destabilize the carbanion formed by loss of H+ 
from the ring. 
The increase in the rate of exchange of ring hydrogens in toluene when heavy 
benzene was used instead of deuterium is an effect similar to that reported by Saunders 
and Hightower for benzene exchange. The magnitude of the increase is somewhat 
lower in the present work but is sufficient to indicate that intermolecular exchange 
between alkylbenzene molecules takes place at a faster rate than the reaction between 
an alkylbenzene molecule and adsorbed deuterium from D2. 
The initial rates of reaction in the simultaneous exchange of benzene and toluene 
with deuterium show a relative rate for the two molecules which is the reverse of that 
found in the separate exchange reactions ; the rate of exchange of benzene is reduced 
to a greater extent by the presence of toluene than vice versa; this effect is probably 
due to the relative strengths of adsorption of the two molecules. The equivalent 
rates of reaction of both molecules found at later stages of the simultaneous exchange 
experiment is due to the fast rate of cross exchange which becomes an increasingly 
important source of exchanged benzene as the reaction progresses. 
The absence of ortho-para directing effects of the methyl group on the exchange 
of the ring atoms of toluene may be due to the incompleteness of the n-system as 
originally proposed by McCosh and Kemball.2 Saunders and Hightower 
have 
suggested that a rapid intermolecular exchange may mask the influence of ortho-para 
directing effects in the exchange of ring atoms of alkylbenzenes but this explanation 
will only apply if the intermolecular reaction itself is free from appreciable ortho-para 
directing effects.

ALKYLBENZENE EXCHANGE ON OXIDES 
The rate of redistribution o
f
 
deuterium in C6H5.CD3 
is sufficiently 
high to indicate 
that the slow exchange of the methyl hydrogens of toluene with deuterium from either 
D2 or heavy benzene probably occurs via an intermolecular transfer of deuterium 
from the more readily replaced ring positions. The rate determining step for this 
process is the fission of a carbon-hydrogen bond of the side-group. Since scrambling 
takes place more rapidly with C6H4(CD3)2 
than with C6H&D3 it is possible that 
intramolecular ring/side-group exchange may contribute to the overall redistribution 
reaction. 
REACTIONS O N  MAGNESIUM OXIDE 
Magnesium oxide appears to be an effective catalyst for intermolecular reactions 
of unsaturated hydrocarbons. The probable existence of a rapid intermolecular 
exchange process during the reaction of propene with deuterium at 200 K has been 
indicated by recent work using microwave spectroscopy.20 The present results for 
the rates of scrambling with C6H5CD3 
and C6H4(CD& show that intermolecular 
exchange of the aromatic molecules occurs at 273 K and is capable of equilibrating 
both ring and side-group hydrogen atoms. The existence of such intermolecular 
exchange can explain the absence of any differentiation between the rates of ring 
and side-group exchange for the reaction of toluene with deuterium. There seems 
to be some parallel between magnesium oxide and titanium dioxide (rutile) for 
reactions of propene and toluene, although titanium dioxide is a much less active 
catalyst. There is evidence 2o for intermolecular exchange of propene on rutile at 
550 K and at a slightly higher temperature there is also little difference between the 
rates of exchange of ring and side-group atoms in toluene with deuterim. 
As with alumina, the exchange of toluene with C6D6 is significantly faster than 
the corresponding exchange with deuterium ; 
this suggests that adsorption-desorption 
processes for deuterium are not rapid in the presence of aromatic molecules and may 
control, at least to some extent, the rates of exchange on both oxides. Dissociation 
to form carbanionic intermediates may be the most likely mechanism for the exchange 
of aromatic molecules on magnesium oxide but the general similarity for the rates of 
all the exchange processes with benzene, toluene and p-xylene means that there is 
little evidence about the detailed nature of the reactive intermediates at this stage. 
However, the work has established a number of significant differences between 
magnesium oxide and y-alumina for reactions involving aromatic molecules.
