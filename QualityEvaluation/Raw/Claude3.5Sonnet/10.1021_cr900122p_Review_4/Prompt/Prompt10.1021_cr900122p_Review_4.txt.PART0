Intramolecular CH bond activation processes can also explain some deactivation processes of well-defined single-site supported catalysts. For instance, one deactivation pathway of supported alkene polymerization catalyst based on lanthanides and actinides probably is due to the activation of the allylic CH bond in place of insertion of propene, thus yielding inactive π-allyl surface complexes (Scheme 22a). (66, 279, 280) More recently, it was shown that CH bond activation could lead to the deactivation of silica supported alkene metathesis catalysts. (281) From kinetic and in situ spectroscopic studies in combination with calculations, it was shown that the well-defined silica supported Re-based alkene metathesis catalyst decomposed, leading to degrafting, and that this process is first order in ethene. The key step of this process probably involved the activation of the CH bond in the β-position of the metallacyclobutane intermediates, a β-H transfer process (Scheme 22b). The resulting allyl hydride intermediate could then react with ethene to form a highly reactive species, which could either regenerate the catalyst via α-H abstraction between two adjacent alkyl ligands or degraft via abstraction of the β-H of the ethyl fragment by the siloxy ligand (β-H abstraction).
Scheme 22
Scheme 22. (a) Deactivation of Polymerization Catalysts by Formation of π-Allyl Species; (b) Deactivation of Alkene Metathesis Catalysts by Decomposition of Metallacyclobutane Intermediates (e.g. the Well-Defined Silica Supported Re Alkylidene Complex); and (c) H/D Exchange via Chain Walking
Additionally, β-H transfer can also lead to side reactions in hydrogenation with d0 metal-based supported (66, 242, 279, 280, 282, 283) and homogeneous catalysts. (284-286) In the latter case, it was shown that β-H transfer can become competitive with hydrogenolysis under low pressure of H2. This led to chain walking, as evidenced by the incorporation of deuterium at various positions of the alkyl chain when the reaction was performed with D2 in place of H2 (Scheme 22c).
Alkane Hydrogenolysis
The hydrogenolysis of alkanes and paraffins occurs catalytically at low temperatures on metal hydrides supported on various oxides, e.g. silica, silicaalumina, or alumina. In the case of group 4 metals and particularly Zr, based on selectivities at low conversions and the final product distribution (Table 2 and Scheme 23a, e.g. alkane = propane), the hydrogenolysis of alkanes has been proposed to take place with the following key steps: CH bond activation of the alkane via σ-bond metathesis (vide supra), CC bond activation via β-alkyl transfer, hydrogenolysis of the MC bond, and hydrogenation of the alkene (composed of two elementary steps, insertion and hydrogenolysis, Scheme 23b). (229, 230, 232, 287-289) In order to account for the absence of alkenes and the relatively low reaction temperatures, an alternative pathway has been proposed from calculations based on the bis-hydride surface species, which avoids the high endothermic formation of alkene intermediates, a relatively thermodynamically disfavored process (Scheme 23c). (229, 230) It is clear, however, that β-alkyl transfer is the key CC bond cleavage step, and this is further supported by the observed lack of hydrogenolysis activities toward ethane, for which the corresponding alkyl surface species (ethyl) does not possess a βC-C bond. Moreover, cyclic alkanes having less than seven carbons (n < 1) do not undergo hydrogenolysis, which illustrates the requirement of a syn-coplanar arrangement of the MC and CC bonds in the β-alkyl transfer transition states (Scheme 23d). (290) Using other supports (silicaalumina (288) and alumina (291)) and group 4 metals (Ti (292) and Hf (293)) does not greatly affect the rate and the product distribution, which shows that β-alkyl transfer is a general CC bond cleavage process for d0 group 4 metals.

It is noteworthy that this reaction can be extended to very long chain alkanes (C36) and polymers, and in fact, supported Zr hydrides can readily polymerize ethene and then depolymerize the thus-formed polyethylene under H2. (232, 288) For the hydrogenolysis of linear alkanes, the observed selectivities (Table 2) showed that CC bond cleavage is statistical and occurs at similar rates from primary or secondary alkyl Zr species; for example, the ratio of ethane/(propane + methane)  2 (Scheme 24a). On the other hand, it is disfavored from tertiary alkyl Zr species, as evidenced by the low selectivity in isopentane in the hydrogenolysis of 3-methylpentane (Table 2 and Scheme 24b). (255)

Scheme 24. Possible Product Formation in the Hydrogenolysis of (a) Butane and (b) 3-Methylpentane
Hydrogenolysis of alkanes is also catalyzed at low temperatures by silica supported tantalum hydrides, but the observed selectivities at low conversions and the final product distribution are very different (Table 3 and Scheme 25a). Moreover, the possibility of catalyzing the hydrogenolysis of ethane clearly shows that β-alkyl transfer cannot be the key CC bond cleavage step in this case. (294) Here, based on these observations and calculations, the CC bond activation step is the α-alkyl transfer, (295) and the elementary steps of hydrogenolysis are as follows: CH bond activation, probably on a TaV trishydride species, via σ-bond metathesis, CC bond cleavage through α-alkyl transfer, and hydrogenolysis (Scheme 25bc). (296)
