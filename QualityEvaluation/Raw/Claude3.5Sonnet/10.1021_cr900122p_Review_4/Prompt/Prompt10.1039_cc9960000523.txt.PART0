The CH4/D2 
exchange reaction is used as an indication of 
methane activation over potential oxide catalysts; Ga2O3 
exhibits an exchange rate over two orders of magnitude 
higher than other simple oxides and this approach leads to 
the identification of Ga203/M003 
as a selective catalyst for 
methane partial oxidation to methanol. 
In recent years there has been considerable research attention 
directed to the identification of catalysts for the direct 
conversion of methane to more useful products. Most effort has 
been given to the oxidative coupling reaction,' but more 
recently there has been some success in the synthesis of 
catalysts active for the direct oxidation of methane to meth- 
anoL2 At the high temperatures required to activate both 
methane and the oxidant, which in most cases is dioxygen, 
virtually all oxide surfaces display some activity' and hence the 
selection of suitable catalysts has been more on the basis of 
screening exercises than by scientific design. A number of 
approaches have been made concerning the identification of 
suitable catalysts3 but, to date, none has proved to be useful in 
a predictive manner. We have now successfully addressed this 
problem and have used the CH4/D2 exchange reaction as an 
indication of methane activation over simple oxides, since the 
initial activation of methane and oxygen are key elementary 
steps in the overall oxidation process. The exchange reaction of 
methane and other hydrocarbons with deuterium has been 
extensively studied over many metals and is generally accepted 
to proceed via surface radical  specie. However, the exchange 
reaction over oxides, which are the main components of 
oxidation catalysts, has received scant attention, and only minor 
attention has been given to y-A1203,5 chromium oxide ge1,6 
La203,7 
Ti028 
and a range of oxides including MgO, CaO, SrO 
and BaO.9 We have now made a detailed study of this reaction 
over simple oxides and in this communication we demonstrate 
the use of this reaction as a predictive catalyst design 
parameter. 
Exchange experiments were carried out in a continuous flow 
microreactor and the origin of the oxide catalysts has been given 
previously. 
10 Catalysts were tested in powdered form and were 
conditioned in the flow of methane and hydrogen at 540 "C for 
2 h prior to testing. A methane :hydrogen ratio of 0.83 : 
1 was 
utilised with a total gas hourly space velocity of 290 h-1. The 
hydrogen flow into the reactor was then substituted via a 
switching valve with a carefully balanced flow rate of 
deuterium to minimise disruption in the flow. Pulses of 
deuterium (200 s duration) were introduced with methane to the 
catalyst. The exchange products were analysed on-line using a 
gas chromatograph mass spectrometer fitted with a quadrupole 
mass spectrometer unit. The empty silica reactor tube was 
shown to be inactive. Steady-state exchange rates were 
normally measured in the range 690-810 K. The rates for the 
most active oxides were measured at lower temperatures 
(Cr203,640-720 K; ZnO, 620-670 K; Ga203, 
560-600 K). All 
catalysts showed linear Arrhenius plots, with activation ener- 
gies in the range 115-230 kJ mol-I. The singly deuteriated 
species, CH3D, was the major product in all cases, with CH2D2 
being observed at high conversions. A comparison of a number 
of oxides is given in Fig. 1, which reports specific exchange 
activities at 773 K, obtained by extrapolation of the Arrhenius 
plots where necessary. The bulk oxides were studied by X-ray 
diffraction after use. Several formed hydroxide phases, includ- 
ing CaO, La203 and Nd203, whilst the oxides Fe2O3, Mn2O3 
and VzO5 were reduced to the phases shown in Fig. 1. Moo3 
and WO3 were also investigated, and formed oxygen-deficient 
shear structures such as 
however, these were inactive 
for the exchange reaction. 
Most noteworthy is that the rate of methane/deuterium 
exchange over gallium oxide is nearly two orders of magnitude 
higher than for any other oxide, with ZnO and chromia also 
showing high activity. Under our experimental conditions 
tantalum oxide, ceria and titania (Degussa P45, mixed anatase 
and rutile) showed the lowest measurable activity, while silica, 
niobia, Tb407 
and Y203 were inactive. The results indicate that 
CH3D was the primary product and the exchange process took 
place in a stepwise manner. This stepwise mechanism of 
exchange was also previously observed over Cr2O3,S and is very 
different from the simultaneous production of CH3D, CH2D2, 
CHD3 and CD4 over metal catalysts. It is considered that the

mechanism of exchange over the more basic oxides proceeds 
viu an anionic intermediate8 and this accounts for the significant 
differences between metals and oxides for this reaction. 
The high activity demonstrated by Ga203 and ZnO is of 
significance since both these oxides are the preferred catalysts 
components together with H-ZSM-5 for the aromatisation of 
propane and butane in the Cyclar process.' The identification 
of the high CH4/D2 exchange rate gives some background to the 
origin of their catalytic efficacy since Ga203 and ZnO are 
considered to play a key role in the initial activation of the 
alkane by polarising a C-H bond.l2 On the basis of these 
findings we considered that Ga203 
could be a useful component 
of selective methane oxidation catalysts. Previously we have 
studied the stability of methanol towards oxidation at elevated 
temperatures over oxides and have shown that a correlation 
exists between the rate of methanol oxidation and the rate of its 
'*02/1602 exchange reaction.10 From these studies we identified 
Moo3 as an oxide for which methanol was reasonably stable, 
but was known to activate dioxygen.13 To test the hypothesis 
that Ga203 
would improve methane activation when used as a 
catalyst component, a physical mixture of Ga203 and Moo3 
(mole ratio 1 : 
1) was prepared by grinding the oxides together 
followed by calcination [650 "C, 3 h]. X-Ray diffraction 
analysis and other characterisation methods did not indicate that 
any significant changes in the oxides had occurred on 
calcination. Ga203, Moo3 and the Ga203/Mo03 physical 
mixture were then used separately as methane oxidation 
catalysts in a silica-lined stainless-steel microrector at 15 bar 
using a reaction mixture of CH4 
: 
O2 
: 
He = 23 : 
2 : 
5 with a total 
gas hourly space velocity of 5000 h-1. The experimental results 
are shown in Table 1 and it is clear that although both Ga2O3 and 
Moo3 exhibit low methanol selectivities, the Ga203/M003 
physical mixture significantly enhances the rate of methanol 
formation. In this way the simple physical mixture of the two 
oxides has combined beneficially the characteristics of both 
oxides. 
At this stage we have made no attempt to optimise the use of 
Ga203 as a catalyst component, but it is clear that the 
incorporation of Gaz03, and possibly also ZnO and Cr203, 
in 
catalyst formulations could lead to the design of novel high 
activity catalysts for the partial oxidation of methane.
