The given literature does not contain any information relevant to answering the question about C-H bond activation in the deactivation of supported alkene polymerization and metathesis catalysts. The document appears to focus on catalysts for selective oxidation of paraffins, and does not discuss lanthanide/actinide-based or silica-supported Re-based catalysts for alkene polymerization or metathesis. There is no mention of π-allyl surface complexes, β-H transfer, or related deactivation mechanisms for these types of catalysts. The question cannot be adequately answered based solely on the information provided in this literature.

给定的文献不包含任何与回答有关烯烃聚合和复分解催化剂失活中C-H键活化的问题相关的信息。该文件似乎侧重于选择性氧化烷烃的催化剂,并未讨论用于烯烃聚合或复分解的镧系/锕系或硅胶负载的Re基催化剂。文中没有提到π-烯丙基表面络合物、β-H转移或这些类型催化剂的相关失活机制。仅基于本文献中提供的信息,无法充分回答该问题。
