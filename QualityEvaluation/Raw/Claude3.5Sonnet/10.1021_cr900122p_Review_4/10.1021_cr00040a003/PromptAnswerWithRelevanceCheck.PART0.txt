Read the questions and answers provided below. First, critically assess the overall relevance of the answers provided to the set of questions asked.

If, upon your assessment, you find that the answers do not contain information that is relevant to the questions asked, stop your review process immediately and respond with a single sentence: "※※※※※※※The provided answers are not relevant to the questions.※※※※※※※". Do not provide any additional explanation or background information, only this sentence should be given as a response in case of irrelevant answers.

If, however, the answers are relevant to the questions asked, proceed to compile answers for each question according to the instructions below. Ensure to aggregate all the relevant answers from the multiple answer results provided in the document, and organize them sequentially by their order number, compiling the corresponding quotes, English answers, and Chinese answers for each question.

If the provided answers' quotes are not differentiated by question, ensure to break them down and assign the quotes to each respective question, outputting them separately within each question's section.

To provide a comprehensive review, differentiate the responses into quotes, English answers, and Chinese answers for each question based on the details given in the 'Answer' XML tags. Structure your review using the XML format showcased below if the answers are relevant to the questions asked:

<questions>

Analyze the role of intramolecular C-H bond activation in the deactivation of supported alkene polymerization and metathesis catalysts, comparing the specific mechanisms involved for lanthanide/actinide-based and silica-supported Re-based catalysts. Discuss the key steps in these processes, including the formation of π-allyl surface complexes and β-H transfer, and evaluate the potential consequences of these deactivation pathways on catalyst performance and longevity.

<EnglishVersionAnswer>

The given literature does not contain specific information about intramolecular C-H bond activation in the deactivation of supported alkene polymerization and metathesis catalysts, or comparisons between lanthanide/actinide-based and silica-supported Re-based catalysts. The document focuses more broadly on hydrocarbon chemistry on metal surfaces and does not discuss the specific catalyst systems mentioned in the question. Without relevant information from the provided text, I cannot properly answer this question.

<ChineseVersionAnswer>

给定的文献中没有包含关于支持的烯烃聚合和复分解催化剂的分子内C-H键活化失活的具体信息,也没有比较镧系/锕系催化剂和硅胶负载的Re基催化剂。该文档更多地关注金属表面上的烃类化学,而没有讨论问题中提到的特定催化剂系统。由于在提供的文本中没有相关信息,我无法正确回答这个问题。

The given literature does not contain information specifically addressing intramolecular C-H bond activation in the deactivation of supported alkene polymerization and metathesis catalysts, or comparing mechanisms for lanthanide/actinide-based and silica-supported Re-based catalysts. The document does not discuss π-allyl surface complexes, β-H transfer, or their consequences for catalyst performance in these specific systems. The text appears to be a broad review of hydrocarbon chemistry on transition metal surfaces, but does not go into the level of detail required to answer this specific question about catalyst deactivation mechanisms.

所给文献并未包含关于支持的烯烃聚合和复分解催化剂中分子内C-H键活化的失活机理的具体信息,也没有比较镧系/锕系和硅胶负载Re基催化剂的机理。文档没有讨论π-烯丙基表面络合物、β-H转移,或它们对这些特定体系中催化剂性能的影响。这篇文章似乎是关于过渡金属表面碳氢化合物化学的广泛综述,但没有深入到回答这个关于催化剂失活机理的具体问题所需的详细程度。

<EnglishVersionAnswer>

The provided literature does not contain specific information about intramolecular C-H bond activation in the deactivation of supported alkene polymerization and metathesis catalysts, or comparisons between lanthanide/actinide-based and silica-supported Re-based catalysts. The document focuses primarily on the chemistry of hydrocarbon moieties on transition metal surfaces and does not discuss the specific catalyst systems mentioned in the question. Therefore, I cannot provide a detailed answer to this question based solely on the given information.
