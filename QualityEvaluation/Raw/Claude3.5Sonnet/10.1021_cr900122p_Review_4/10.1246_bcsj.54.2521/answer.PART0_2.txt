<EnglishVersionAnswer>

The provided literature does not contain any information relevant to answering the question about intramolecular C-H bond activation in the deactivation of supported alkene polymerization and metathesis catalysts. The document appears to be about alumina catalysts for isomerization and hydrogen exchange reactions, which is unrelated to the specific topic being asked about. There is no mention of lanthanide/actinide-based catalysts, silica-supported Re-based catalysts, π-allyl surface complexes, or β-H transfer processes. Therefore, this question cannot be answered based on the given literature.

提供的文献中没有任何与回答关于支持的烯烃聚合和复分解催化剂失活过程中分子内C-H键活化的问题相关的信息。该文献似乎是关于异构化和氢交换反应的氧化铝催化剂的内容，与所问的具体主题无关。文中没有提到镧系/锕系催化剂、硅胶负载的Re基催化剂、π-烯丙基表面络合物或β-H转移过程。因此，基于给定的文献无法回答这个问题。
