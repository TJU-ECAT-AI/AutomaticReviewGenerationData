Read the questions and answers provided below. First, critically assess the overall relevance of the answers provided to the set of questions asked.

If, upon your assessment, you find that the answers do not contain information that is relevant to the questions asked, stop your review process immediately and respond with a single sentence: "※※※※※※※The provided answers are not relevant to the questions.※※※※※※※". Do not provide any additional explanation or background information, only this sentence should be given as a response in case of irrelevant answers.

If, however, the answers are relevant to the questions asked, proceed to compile answers for each question according to the instructions below. Ensure to aggregate all the relevant answers from the multiple answer results provided in the document, and organize them sequentially by their order number, compiling the corresponding quotes, English answers, and Chinese answers for each question.

If the provided answers' quotes are not differentiated by question, ensure to break them down and assign the quotes to each respective question, outputting them separately within each question's section.

To provide a comprehensive review, differentiate the responses into quotes, English answers, and Chinese answers for each question based on the details given in the 'Answer' XML tags. Structure your review using the XML format showcased below if the answers are relevant to the questions asked:

<questions>

Analyze the role of intramolecular C-H bond activation in the deactivation of supported alkene polymerization and metathesis catalysts, comparing the specific mechanisms involved for lanthanide/actinide-based and silica-supported Re-based catalysts. Discuss the key steps in these processes, including the formation of π-allyl surface complexes and β-H transfer, and evaluate the potential consequences of these deactivation pathways on catalyst performance and longevity.

<EnglishVersionAnswer>

The given scientific literature does not contain any information relevant to answering this question about intramolecular C-H bond activation in the deactivation of supported alkene polymerization and metathesis catalysts. The document focuses on propane aromatization over HZSM-5 and Ga/HZSM-5 catalysts, and does not discuss lanthanide/actinide-based or silica-supported Re-based catalysts, π-allyl surface complexes, β-H transfer, or related deactivation mechanisms. Therefore, this question cannot be answered based solely on the provided text.

<ChineseVersionAnswer>

给定的科学文献不包含任何与回答这个关于支持烯烃聚合和复分解催化剂失活中分子内C-H键活化的问题相关的信息。该文档主要讨论了HZSM-5和Ga/HZSM-5催化剂上的丙烷芳构化,并没有涉及镧系/锕系或硅胶负载的Re基催化剂、π-烯丙基表面络合物、β-H转移或相关的失活机理。因此,仅基于所提供的文本无法回答这个问题。

<EnglishVersionAnswer>

The given literature does not contain any relevant information to answer this question about intramolecular C-H bond activation and deactivation mechanisms in supported alkene polymerization and metathesis catalysts. The text appears to focus on propane aromatization over HZSM-5 and gallium-modified ZSM-5 catalysts, which is unrelated to the topic of the question. Without additional relevant information, I cannot provide a meaningful answer about the specific deactivation mechanisms for lanthanide/actinide-based and silica-supported Re-based catalysts.
