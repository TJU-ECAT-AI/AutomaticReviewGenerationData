[1] "Intramolecular CH bond activation processes can also explain some deactivation processes of well-defined single-site supported catalysts. For instance, one deactivation pathway of supported alkene polymerization catalyst based on lanthanides and actinides probably is due to the activation of the allylic CH bond in place of insertion of propene, thus yielding inactive π-allyl surface complexes (Scheme 22a)."

[2] "More recently, it was shown that CH bond activation could lead to the deactivation of silica supported alkene metathesis catalysts. (281) From kinetic and in situ spectroscopic studies in combination with calculations, it was shown that the well-defined silica supported Re-based alkene metathesis catalyst decomposed, leading to degrafting, and that this process is first order in ethene."

[3] "The key step of this process probably involved the activation of the CH bond in the β-position of the metallacyclobutane intermediates, a β-H transfer process (Scheme 22b). The resulting allyl hydride intermediate could then react with ethene to form a highly reactive species, which could either regenerate the catalyst via α-H abstraction between two adjacent alkyl ligands or degraft via abstraction of the β-H of the ethyl fragment by the siloxy ligand (β-H abstraction)."

Intramolecular C-H bond activation plays a significant role in the deactivation of supported alkene polymerization and metathesis catalysts, with different mechanisms observed for lanthanide/actinide-based and silica-supported Re-based catalysts.

For lanthanide and actinide-based supported alkene polymerization catalysts, the deactivation pathway involves the activation of the allylic C-H bond instead of propene insertion. This process results in the formation of inactive π-allyl surface complexes, effectively rendering the catalyst unable to continue the polymerization process.

In the case of silica-supported Re-based alkene metathesis catalysts, the deactivation mechanism is more complex. The process is first-order in ethene and involves the activation of the C-H bond in the β-position of metallacyclobutane intermediates. This β-H transfer process leads to the formation of an allyl hydride intermediate, which can react with ethene to form a highly reactive species. This species can then either regenerate the catalyst through α-H abstraction between adjacent alkyl ligands or lead to degrafting via β-H abstraction of the ethyl fragment by the siloxy ligand.

The consequences of these deactivation pathways on catalyst performance and longevity are significant. For lanthanide/actinide-based catalysts, the formation of inactive π-allyl complexes directly reduces the number of active catalytic sites, thereby decreasing overall catalytic activity and productivity over time. In the case of Re-based catalysts, the deactivation process can lead to either catalyst regeneration or degrafting. The degrafting process is particularly detrimental as it results in the loss of catalytic sites from the support surface, permanently reducing catalyst performance.

These deactivation mechanisms highlight the importance of understanding and controlling C-H activation processes in supported catalysts. Mitigating these effects could lead to the development of more stable and long-lived catalysts for alkene polymerization and metathesis reactions, ultimately improving process efficiency and product yields in industrial applications.

分子内C-H键活化在负载型烯烃聚合和复分解催化剂的失活过程中起着重要作用，其中镧系/锕系催化剂和硅胶负载的Re基催化剂表现出不同的机理。

对于镧系和锕系负载型烯烃聚合催化剂，失活途径涉及烯丙基C-H键的活化，而不是丙烯的插入。这个过程导致形成无活性的π-烯丙基表面络合物，有效地使催化剂无法继续进行聚合过程。

对于硅胶负载的Re基烯烃复分解催化剂，失活机理更为复杂。该过程对乙烯呈一级反应，涉及金属环丁烷中间体β位C-H键的活化。这种β-H转移过程导致形成烯丙基氢化物中间体，该中间体可与乙烯反应形成高活性物种。这种物种随后可以通过相邻烷基配体之间的α-H抽提再生催化剂，或通过硅氧基配体对乙基片段的β-H抽提导致脱附。

这些失活途径对催化剂性能和寿命的影响是显著的。对于镧系/锕系催化剂，无活性π-烯丙基络合物的形成直接减少了活性催化位点的数量，从而随时间推移降低了整体催化活性和生产力。对于Re基催化剂，失活过程可能导致催化剂再生或脱附。脱附过程尤其有害，因为它导致催化位点从支持表面流失，永久性地降低了催化剂性能。

这些失活机理突出了理解和控制负载型催化剂中C-H活化过程的重要性。减轻这些效应可能导致开发出更稳定、寿命更长的烯烃聚合和复分解反应催化剂，最终提高工业应用中的过程效率和产品产率。
