[1] "Intramolecular CH bond activation processes can also explain some deactivation processes of well-defined single-site supported catalysts. For instance, one deactivation pathway of supported alkene polymerization catalyst based on lanthanides and actinides probably is due to the activation of the allylic CH bond in place of insertion of propene, thus yielding inactive π-allyl surface complexes (Scheme 22a)."

[2] "More recently, it was shown that CH bond activation could lead to the deactivation of silica supported alkene metathesis catalysts. (281) From kinetic and in situ spectroscopic studies in combination with calculations, it was shown that the well-defined silica supported Re-based alkene metathesis catalyst decomposed, leading to degrafting, and that this process is first order in ethene."

[3] "The key step of this process probably involved the activation of the CH bond in the β-position of the metallacyclobutane intermediates, a β-H transfer process (Scheme 22b). The resulting allyl hydride intermediate could then react with ethene to form a highly reactive species, which could either regenerate the catalyst via α-H abstraction between two adjacent alkyl ligands or degraft via abstraction of the β-H of the ethyl fragment by the siloxy ligand (β-H abstraction)."

Intramolecular C-H bond activation plays a significant role in the deactivation of supported alkene polymerization and metathesis catalysts, with different mechanisms observed for lanthanide/actinide-based and silica-supported Re-based catalysts.

For lanthanide and actinide-based supported alkene polymerization catalysts, the deactivation occurs through the activation of the allylic C-H bond instead of propene insertion. This process results in the formation of inactive π-allyl surface complexes, effectively terminating the catalytic activity.

In the case of silica-supported Re-based alkene metathesis catalysts, the deactivation mechanism is more complex. The key step involves the activation of the C-H bond in the β-position of metallacyclobutane intermediates, leading to a β-H transfer process. This results in the formation of an allyl hydride intermediate, which can then react with ethene to form a highly reactive species. This species has two potential pathways:

1. Regeneration of the catalyst through α-H abstraction between two adjacent alkyl ligands.
2. Degrafting via abstraction of the β-H of the ethyl fragment by the siloxy ligand (β-H abstraction).

The deactivation process for the Re-based catalyst is first-order in ethene, indicating that the presence of ethene plays a crucial role in the deactivation mechanism.

These deactivation pathways have significant consequences for catalyst performance and longevity. The formation of inactive π-allyl surface complexes in lanthanide/actinide-based catalysts directly reduces the number of active sites available for polymerization, leading to decreased catalytic activity over time. For the Re-based metathesis catalysts, the potential for catalyst regeneration through α-H abstraction provides a mechanism for maintaining some catalytic activity. However, the competing degrafting process can lead to a permanent loss of active sites from the support surface, ultimately resulting in decreased catalyst longevity and performance.

Understanding these deactivation mechanisms is crucial for developing strategies to improve catalyst stability and longevity, such as modifying catalyst structures or reaction conditions to minimize C-H bond activation and promote catalyst regeneration over degrafting.

分子内C-H键活化在支持的烯烃聚合和复分解催化剂的失活过程中起着重要作用，镧系/锕系基催化剂和硅胶支持的Re基催化剂的失活机理存在差异。

对于镧系和锕系基支持的烯烃聚合催化剂，失活是通过烯丙基C-H键的活化而不是丙烯的插入来实现的。这个过程导致形成无活性的π-烯丙基表面络合物，有效地终止了催化活性。

对于硅胶支持的Re基烯烃复分解催化剂，失活机理更为复杂。关键步骤涉及金属环丁烷中间体β位C-H键的活化，导致β-H转移过程。这导致形成烯丙基氢化物中间体，然后可以与乙烯反应形成高活性物种。这种物种有两种潜在途径：

1. 通过相邻烷基配体之间的α-H抽提再生催化剂。
2. 通过硅氧基配体抽提乙基片段的β-H（β-H抽提）而脱附。

Re基催化剂的失活过程对乙烯呈一级反应，表明乙烯的存在在失活机理中起着关键作用。

这些失活途径对催化剂性能和寿命有重大影响。镧系/锕系基催化剂中无活性π-烯丙基表面络合物的形成直接减少了可用于聚合的活性位点数量，导致催化活性随时间降低。对于Re基复分解催化剂，通过α-H抽提再生催化剂的可能性提供了维持一定催化活性的机制。然而，竞争性的脱附过程可能导致活性位点从支持表面永久流失，最终导致催化剂寿命和性能下降。

理解这些失活机理对开发提高催化剂稳定性和寿命的策略至关重要，例如修改催化剂结构或反应条件以最小化C-H键活化，并促进催化剂再生而非脱附。
