[1] "Intramolecular CH bond activation processes can also explain some deactivation processes of well-defined single-site supported catalysts. For instance, one deactivation pathway of supported alkene polymerization catalyst based on lanthanides and actinides probably is due to the activation of the allylic CH bond in place of insertion of propene, thus yielding inactive π-allyl surface complexes (Scheme 22a)."

[2] "More recently, it was shown that CH bond activation could lead to the deactivation of silica supported alkene metathesis catalysts. (281) From kinetic and in situ spectroscopic studies in combination with calculations, it was shown that the well-defined silica supported Re-based alkene metathesis catalyst decomposed, leading to degrafting, and that this process is first order in ethene."

[3] "The key step of this process probably involved the activation of the CH bond in the β-position of the metallacyclobutane intermediates, a β-H transfer process (Scheme 22b). The resulting allyl hydride intermediate could then react with ethene to form a highly reactive species, which could either regenerate the catalyst via α-H abstraction between two adjacent alkyl ligands or degraft via abstraction of the β-H of the ethyl fragment by the siloxy ligand (β-H abstraction)."

Intramolecular C-H bond activation plays a significant role in the deactivation of supported alkene polymerization and metathesis catalysts, with different mechanisms observed for lanthanide/actinide-based and silica-supported Re-based catalysts.

For lanthanide and actinide-based supported alkene polymerization catalysts, the deactivation pathway involves the activation of the allylic C-H bond instead of propene insertion. This process results in the formation of inactive π-allyl surface complexes, effectively shutting down the catalytic activity.

In the case of silica-supported Re-based alkene metathesis catalysts, the deactivation mechanism is more complex. The process involves the activation of the C-H bond in the β-position of metallacyclobutane intermediates, leading to a β-H transfer process. This results in the formation of an allyl hydride intermediate, which can then react with ethene to form a highly reactive species. This species has two potential pathways: it can either regenerate the catalyst through α-H abstraction between adjacent alkyl ligands, or it can lead to degrafting via β-H abstraction of the ethyl fragment by the siloxy ligand.

The key steps in these processes include:
1. For lanthanide/actinide catalysts: Allylic C-H bond activation and formation of π-allyl surface complexes.
2. For Re-based catalysts: β-H transfer in metallacyclobutane intermediates, formation of allyl hydride intermediates, and potential degrafting through β-H abstraction.

These deactivation pathways have significant consequences for catalyst performance and longevity. The formation of inactive π-allyl complexes in lanthanide/actinide catalysts directly reduces the number of active sites available for polymerization, decreasing overall catalyst efficiency. For Re-based catalysts, the potential for degrafting can lead to a loss of active catalyst from the support surface, reducing the overall catalyst loading and activity over time. Additionally, the competing pathways of catalyst regeneration and degrafting in Re-based systems may result in a gradual decline in performance as the reaction progresses.

Understanding these deactivation mechanisms is crucial for developing strategies to improve catalyst stability and longevity, such as modifying ligand structures or support materials to minimize unwanted C-H activation processes.

分子内C-H键活化在负载型烯烃聚合和复分解催化剂的失活中起着重要作用，镧系/锕系催化剂和硅胶负载的Re基催化剂表现出不同的机理。

对于镧系和锕系负载型烯烃聚合催化剂，失活途径涉及烯丙基C-H键的活化，而不是丙烯的插入。这一过程导致形成不活性的π-烯丙基表面络合物，从而有效地停止了催化活性。

对于硅胶负载的Re基烯烃复分解催化剂，失活机理更为复杂。该过程涉及金属环丁烷中间体β位C-H键的活化，导致β-H转移过程。这导致形成烯丙基氢化物中间体，然后可与乙烯反应形成高活性物种。这种物种有两个潜在途径：它可以通过相邻烷基配体之间的α-H抽提再生催化剂，或者通过硅氧基配体对乙基片段的β-H抽提导致脱附。

这些过程的关键步骤包括：
1. 镧系/锕系催化剂：烯丙基C-H键活化和π-烯丙基表面络合物的形成。
2. Re基催化剂：金属环丁烷中间体中的β-H转移，烯丙基氢化物中间体的形成，以及通过β-H抽提可能导致的脱附。

这些失活途径对催化剂性能和寿命有重大影响。镧系/锕系催化剂中不活性π-烯丙基络合物的形成直接减少了可用于聚合的活性位点数量，降低了整体催化效率。对于Re基催化剂，潜在的脱附可能导致活性催化剂从支撑表面流失，随时间推移降低整体催化剂负载量和活性。此外，Re基系统中催化剂再生和脱附的竞争途径可能导致反应进行过程中性能逐渐下降。

理解这些失活机理对开发提高催化剂稳定性和寿命的策略至关重要，例如修改配体结构或支撑材料以最小化不必要的C-H活化过程。
