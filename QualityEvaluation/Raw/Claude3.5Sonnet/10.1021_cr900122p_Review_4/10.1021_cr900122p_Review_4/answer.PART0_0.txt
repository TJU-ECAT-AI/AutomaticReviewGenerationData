[1] "Intramolecular CH bond activation processes can also explain some deactivation processes of well-defined single-site supported catalysts. For instance, one deactivation pathway of supported alkene polymerization catalyst based on lanthanides and actinides probably is due to the activation of the allylic CH bond in place of insertion of propene, thus yielding inactive π-allyl surface complexes (Scheme 22a)."

[2] "More recently, it was shown that CH bond activation could lead to the deactivation of silica supported alkene metathesis catalysts. (281) From kinetic and in situ spectroscopic studies in combination with calculations, it was shown that the well-defined silica supported Re-based alkene metathesis catalyst decomposed, leading to degrafting, and that this process is first order in ethene."

[3] "The key step of this process probably involved the activation of the CH bond in the β-position of the metallacyclobutane intermediates, a β-H transfer process (Scheme 22b). The resulting allyl hydride intermediate could then react with ethene to form a highly reactive species, which could either regenerate the catalyst via α-H abstraction between two adjacent alkyl ligands or degraft via abstraction of the β-H of the ethyl fragment by the siloxy ligand (β-H abstraction)."

Intramolecular C-H bond activation plays a significant role in the deactivation of supported alkene polymerization and metathesis catalysts, with different mechanisms observed for lanthanide/actinide-based and silica-supported Re-based catalysts.

For lanthanide and actinide-based supported alkene polymerization catalysts, the deactivation pathway involves the activation of the allylic C-H bond instead of the desired propene insertion. This process results in the formation of inactive π-allyl surface complexes, effectively deactivating the catalyst.

In the case of silica-supported Re-based alkene metathesis catalysts, the deactivation mechanism is more complex. The key step involves the activation of the C-H bond in the β-position of the metallacyclobutane intermediates, known as β-H transfer. This process leads to the formation of an allyl hydride intermediate, which can then react with ethene to produce a highly reactive species. This reactive species can either regenerate the catalyst through α-H abstraction between adjacent alkyl ligands or cause degrafting via β-H abstraction of the ethyl fragment by the siloxy ligand.

The consequences of these deactivation pathways on catalyst performance and longevity are significant. For lanthanide/actinide-based catalysts, the formation of inactive π-allyl surface complexes directly reduces the number of active sites available for polymerization, decreasing catalyst efficiency over time. In the case of Re-based metathesis catalysts, the deactivation process can lead to either catalyst regeneration or degrafting. While regeneration allows for continued catalytic activity, degrafting results in the loss of active sites from the support surface, ultimately reducing catalyst longevity and overall performance.

These deactivation mechanisms highlight the importance of understanding and controlling intramolecular C-H bond activation in supported catalysts to improve their stability, efficiency, and lifespan in industrial applications.

分子内C-H键活化在负载型烯烃聚合和复分解催化剂的失活过程中起着重要作用，镧系/锕系催化剂和负载在二氧化硅上的Re基催化剂表现出不同的机理。

对于镧系和锕系负载型烯烃聚合催化剂，失活途径涉及烯丙基C-H键的活化，而不是所需的丙烯插入。这一过程导致形成无活性的π-烯丙基表面络合物，从而使催化剂失活。

对于负载在二氧化硅上的Re基烯烃复分解催化剂，失活机理更为复杂。关键步骤涉及金属环丁烷中间体β位C-H键的活化，即β-H转移。这一过程导致形成烯丙基氢化物中间体，后者可与乙烯反应生成高活性物种。这种高活性物种可以通过相邻烷基配体之间的α-H抽提再生催化剂，或通过硅氧基配体对乙基片段的β-H抽提导致脱附。

这些失活途径对催化剂性能和寿命的影响是显著的。对于镧系/锕系催化剂，无活性π-烯丙基表面络合物的形成直接减少了可用于聚合的活性位点数量，降低了催化剂效率。对于Re基复分解催化剂，失活过程可能导致催化剂再生或脱附。虽然再生允许持续的催化活性，但脱附会导致活性位点从支持表面损失，最终降低催化剂寿命和整体性能。

这些失活机理突出了理解和控制负载型催化剂中分子内C-H键活化的重要性，以提高它们在工业应用中的稳定性、效率和使用寿命。
