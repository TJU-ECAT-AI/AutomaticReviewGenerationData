The provided literature does not contain any information relevant to analyzing the role of intramolecular C-H bond activation in the deactivation of supported alkene polymerization and metathesis catalysts. The abstract appears to be about an exchange reaction of methane with deuterium over solid base catalysts, which is unrelated to the question asked. There is insufficient information to discuss the specific mechanisms, key steps, or potential consequences of deactivation pathways for lanthanide/actinide-based and silica-supported Re-based catalysts as requested in the question.

所提供的文献中没有任何与分析分子内C-H键活化在支持的烯烃聚合和复分解催化剂失活中的作用相关的信息。摘要似乎是关于甲烷与氘在固体碱催化剂上的交换反应,这与所问的问题无关。没有足够的信息来讨论问题中要求的镧系/锕系和硅胶负载Re基催化剂的具体机制、关键步骤或失活途径的潜在后果。
