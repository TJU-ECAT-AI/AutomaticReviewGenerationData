This question cannot be answered based on the given literature. The provided text does not contain any information about intramolecular C-H bond activation, deactivation of supported alkene polymerization and metathesis catalysts, or specific mechanisms for lanthanide/actinide-based and silica-supported Re-based catalysts. The literature appears to be an abstract or summary of a different study related to the exchange reaction of methane with deuterium over solid base catalysts, which is not relevant to the question asked.

根据给出的文献无法回答这个问题。提供的文本不包含任何关于分子内C-H键活化、支持的烯烃聚合和复分解催化剂的失活、或镧系/锕系基和硅胶负载Re基催化剂的具体机制的信息。这篇文献似乎是一个关于甲烷与氘在固体碱催化剂上进行交换反应的研究摘要或总结，与所问的问题无关。
