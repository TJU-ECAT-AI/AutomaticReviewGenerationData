The provided literature does not contain any information relevant to answering the question about intramolecular C-H bond activation in the deactivation of supported alkene polymerization and metathesis catalysts. The abstract appears to be about an exchange reaction of methane with deuterium over solid base catalysts, which is unrelated to the topic of the question. There is insufficient information to analyze or discuss the specific mechanisms, key steps, or potential consequences of deactivation pathways for lanthanide/actinide-based and silica-supported Re-based catalysts as requested in the question.

提供的文献不包含任何与回答关于支持的烯烃聚合和复分解催化剂失活过程中分子内C-H键活化的问题相关的信息。摘要似乎是关于甲烷与氘在固体碱催化剂上的交换反应,这与问题的主题无关。没有足够的信息来分析或讨论问题中要求的镧系/锕系和硅胶负载Re基催化剂的特定机理、关键步骤或失活途径的潜在后果。
