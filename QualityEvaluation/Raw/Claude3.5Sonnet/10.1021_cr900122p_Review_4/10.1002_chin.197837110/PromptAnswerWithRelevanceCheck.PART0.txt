Read the questions and answers provided below. First, critically assess the overall relevance of the answers provided to the set of questions asked.

If, upon your assessment, you find that the answers do not contain information that is relevant to the questions asked, stop your review process immediately and respond with a single sentence: "※※※※※※※The provided answers are not relevant to the questions.※※※※※※※". Do not provide any additional explanation or background information, only this sentence should be given as a response in case of irrelevant answers.

If, however, the answers are relevant to the questions asked, proceed to compile answers for each question according to the instructions below. Ensure to aggregate all the relevant answers from the multiple answer results provided in the document, and organize them sequentially by their order number, compiling the corresponding quotes, English answers, and Chinese answers for each question.

If the provided answers' quotes are not differentiated by question, ensure to break them down and assign the quotes to each respective question, outputting them separately within each question's section.

To provide a comprehensive review, differentiate the responses into quotes, English answers, and Chinese answers for each question based on the details given in the 'Answer' XML tags. Structure your review using the XML format showcased below if the answers are relevant to the questions asked:

<questions>

Analyze the role of intramolecular C-H bond activation in the deactivation of supported alkene polymerization and metathesis catalysts, comparing the specific mechanisms involved for lanthanide/actinide-based and silica-supported Re-based catalysts. Discuss the key steps in these processes, including the formation of π-allyl surface complexes and β-H transfer, and evaluate the potential consequences of these deactivation pathways on catalyst performance and longevity.

<EnglishVersionAnswer>

This question cannot be answered based on the given literature. The provided text does not contain any information about intramolecular C-H bond activation, deactivation of supported alkene polymerization and metathesis catalysts, lanthanide/actinide-based catalysts, or silica-supported Re-based catalysts. The text appears to be a brief abstract or citation information for a different study involving methane exchange reactions with deuterium over solid base catalysts. It does not provide any relevant information to address the specific mechanisms, key steps, or consequences of catalyst deactivation as asked in the question.

根据所提供的文献,无法回答这个问题。给出的文本不包含任何关于分子内C-H键活化、负载烯烃聚合和复分解催化剂的失活、镧系/锕系催化剂或硅胶负载Re基催化剂的信息。该文本似乎是一个关于甲烷与氘在固体碱催化剂上进行交换反应的简短摘要或引文信息。它没有提供任何相关信息来解答问题中所询问的具体机理、关键步骤或催化剂失活的后果。
