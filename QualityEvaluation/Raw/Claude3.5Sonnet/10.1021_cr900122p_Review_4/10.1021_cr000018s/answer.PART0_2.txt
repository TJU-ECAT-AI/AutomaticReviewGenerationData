The given literature does not contain any information relevant to analyzing intramolecular C-H bond activation in the deactivation of supported alkene polymerization and metathesis catalysts. The document does not discuss lanthanide/actinide-based catalysts, silica-supported Re-based catalysts, π-allyl surface complexes, or β-H transfer processes. There is no content addressing the specific mechanisms of catalyst deactivation or their consequences on performance and longevity for the catalyst systems mentioned in the question. The literature appears to focus on other topics related to catalysis and carbon management, but does not cover the specific aspects of catalyst deactivation asked about in this question.

给定的文献中没有任何与分析支持的烯烃聚合和复分解催化剂中分子内C-H键活化的失活相关的信息。该文档没有讨论镧系/锕系催化剂、硅胶负载的Re基催化剂、π-烯丙基表面络合物或β-H转移过程。文中没有涉及催化剂失活的具体机理或其对问题中提到的催化剂系统的性能和寿命的影响。这篇文献似乎侧重于与催化和碳管理相关的其他主题,但没有涉及本问题所询问的催化剂失活的具体方面。
