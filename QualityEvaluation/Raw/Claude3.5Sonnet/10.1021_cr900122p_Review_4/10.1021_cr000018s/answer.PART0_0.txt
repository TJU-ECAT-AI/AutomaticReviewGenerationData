The given literature does not contain information specifically addressing intramolecular C-H bond activation in the deactivation of supported alkene polymerization and metathesis catalysts. The document focuses on other topics related to catalysis and carbon management, but does not discuss the mechanisms of lanthanide/actinide-based or silica-supported Re-based catalysts for alkene reactions. There is no mention of π-allyl surface complexes, β-H transfer, or specific deactivation pathways for these types of catalysts. Therefore, this question cannot be adequately answered based solely on the information provided in the given literature.

给定的文献中不包含特别涉及支持的烯烃聚合和复分解催化剂中分子内C-H键活化失活的信息。该文档主要集中在与催化和碳管理相关的其他主题上,但没有讨论镧系/锕系或硅胶负载的Re基催化剂用于烯烃反应的机理。文中没有提到π-烯丙基表面络合物、β-H转移,或这些类型催化剂的特定失活途径。因此,仅基于给定文献中提供的信息无法充分回答这个问题。
