<questions>

Analyze the role of intramolecular C-H bond activation in the deactivation of supported alkene polymerization and metathesis catalysts, comparing the specific mechanisms involved for lanthanide/actinide-based and silica-supported Re-based catalysts. Discuss the key steps in these processes, including the formation of π-allyl surface complexes and β-H transfer, and evaluate the potential consequences of these deactivation pathways on catalyst performance and longevity.

<EnglishVersionAnswer>

The given literature does not contain information specifically addressing intramolecular C-H bond activation in the deactivation of supported alkene polymerization and metathesis catalysts. The document focuses on other topics related to catalysis and carbon management, but does not discuss the mechanisms of lanthanide/actinide-based or silica-supported Re-based catalysts for alkene reactions. There is no mention of π-allyl surface complexes, β-H transfer, or specific deactivation pathways for these types of catalysts. Therefore, this question cannot be adequately answered based solely on the information provided in the given literature.
