Read the questions and answers provided below. First, critically assess the overall relevance of the answers provided to the set of questions asked.

If, upon your assessment, you find that the answers do not contain information that is relevant to the questions asked, stop your review process immediately and respond with a single sentence: "※※※※※※※The provided answers are not relevant to the questions.※※※※※※※". Do not provide any additional explanation or background information, only this sentence should be given as a response in case of irrelevant answers.

If, however, the answers are relevant to the questions asked, proceed to compile answers for each question according to the instructions below. Ensure to aggregate all the relevant answers from the multiple answer results provided in the document, and organize them sequentially by their order number, compiling the corresponding quotes, English answers, and Chinese answers for each question.

If the provided answers' quotes are not differentiated by question, ensure to break them down and assign the quotes to each respective question, outputting them separately within each question's section.

To provide a comprehensive review, differentiate the responses into quotes, English answers, and Chinese answers for each question based on the details given in the 'Answer' XML tags. Structure your review using the XML format showcased below if the answers are relevant to the questions asked:

<questions>

Analyze the role of intramolecular C-H bond activation in the deactivation of supported alkene polymerization and metathesis catalysts, comparing the specific mechanisms involved for lanthanide/actinide-based and silica-supported Re-based catalysts. Discuss the key steps in these processes, including the formation of π-allyl surface complexes and β-H transfer, and evaluate the potential consequences of these deactivation pathways on catalyst performance and longevity.

The given scientific literature does not contain any information relevant to answering the question about intramolecular C-H bond activation in the deactivation of supported alkene polymerization and metathesis catalysts. The text focuses on the preparation and reactivity of alkyl groups adsorbed on metal surfaces, particularly discussing the use of alkyl halides as precursors. It does not discuss lanthanide/actinide-based catalysts, silica-supported Re-based catalysts, π-allyl surface complexes, or β-H transfer in the context of catalyst deactivation. Therefore, this question cannot be answered based on the provided document.

<EnglishVersionAnswer>

The given literature does not contain any information specifically related to intramolecular C-H bond activation in the deactivation of supported alkene polymerization and metathesis catalysts. The document primarily discusses the thermal chemistry and surface reactivity of alkyl groups formed from alkyl halides on transition metal surfaces. It does not cover lanthanide/actinide-based catalysts, silica-supported Re-based catalysts, or the specific deactivation mechanisms mentioned in the question.

The literature does not provide information on π-allyl surface complexes, β-H transfer, or their consequences on catalyst performance and longevity in the context of alkene polymerization or metathesis catalysts. Therefore, this question cannot be adequately answered based solely on the provided text.
