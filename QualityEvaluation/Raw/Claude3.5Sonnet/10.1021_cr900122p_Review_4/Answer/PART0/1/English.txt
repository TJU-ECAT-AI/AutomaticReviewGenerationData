Intramolecular C-H bond activation plays a significant role in the deactivation of supported alkene polymerization and metathesis catalysts, with different mechanisms observed for lanthanide/actinide-based and silica-supported Re-based catalysts.

For lanthanide and actinide-based supported alkene polymerization catalysts, the deactivation pathway involves the activation of the allylic C-H bond instead of propene insertion. This process results in the formation of inactive π-allyl surface complexes, effectively deactivating the catalyst.

In the case of silica-supported Re-based alkene metathesis catalysts, the deactivation mechanism is more complex. The key step involves the activation of the C-H bond in the β-position of metallacyclobutane intermediates, leading to a β-H transfer process. This results in the formation of an allyl hydride intermediate, which can then react with ethene to create a highly reactive species. This species can either regenerate the catalyst through α-H abstraction between adjacent alkyl ligands or lead to degrafting via β-H abstraction of the ethyl fragment by the siloxy ligand.

The key steps in these processes include:
1. For lanthanide/actinide catalysts: Allylic C-H bond activation and formation of π-allyl surface complexes.
2. For Re-based catalysts: β-H transfer in metallacyclobutane intermediates, formation of allyl hydride intermediates, and potential degrafting through β-H abstraction.

These deactivation pathways have significant consequences for catalyst performance and longevity. The formation of inactive π-allyl complexes in lanthanide/actinide catalysts directly reduces the number of active sites available for polymerization, decreasing overall catalyst efficiency. For Re-based catalysts, the potential for degrafting can lead to a loss of active catalyst from the support surface, reducing the overall catalyst loading and activity over time. Additionally, the competing pathways of catalyst regeneration and degrafting in Re-based systems may result in a gradual decline in performance as the reaction progresses.

Understanding these deactivation mechanisms is crucial for developing strategies to improve catalyst stability and longevity, such as modifying ligand structures or support materials to minimize unwanted C-H activation processes.
