Intramolecular C-H bond activation plays a crucial role in the deactivation of supported alkene polymerization and metathesis catalysts, with distinct mechanisms observed for lanthanide/actinide-based and silica-supported Re-based catalysts [10.1021/cr900122p\_4]. This review section focuses on the specific deactivation pathways and their implications for catalyst performance and longevity.

In the case of lanthanide and actinide-based supported alkene polymerization catalysts, the deactivation process involves the activation of the allylic C-H bond instead of the desired propene insertion. This unintended reaction leads to the formation of inactive π-allyl surface complexes, effectively rendering the catalyst inactive [10.1021/cr900122p\_4]. The formation of these π-allyl complexes directly reduces the number of active sites available for polymerization, resulting in a significant decrease in overall catalyst efficiency.

For silica-supported Re-based alkene metathesis catalysts, the deactivation mechanism is more intricate. The key step in this process involves the activation of the C-H bond in the β-position of metallacyclobutane intermediates, leading to a β-H transfer process [10.1021/cr900122p\_4]. This results in the formation of an allyl hydride intermediate, which can subsequently react with ethene to create a highly reactive species. This reactive species can then follow one of two pathways: (1) regenerate the catalyst through α-H abstraction between adjacent alkyl ligands, or (2) lead to degrafting via β-H abstraction of the ethyl fragment by the siloxy ligand [10.1021/cr900122p\_4].

The consequences of these deactivation pathways on catalyst performance and longevity are significant. For Re-based catalysts, the potential for degrafting can lead to a gradual loss of active catalyst from the support surface, reducing the overall catalyst loading and activity over time. The competing pathways of catalyst regeneration and degrafting in these systems may result in a progressive decline in performance as the reaction proceeds [10.1021/cr900122p\_4].



Integrative understanding and prospective outlook: 
Understanding these deactivation mechanisms is crucial for developing strategies to improve catalyst stability and longevity. Future research efforts could focus on:

1. Designing novel ligand structures that minimize unwanted C-H activation processes while maintaining catalytic activity.
2. Exploring alternative support materials that can stabilize the active metal centers and prevent degrafting.
3. Investigating the use of promoters or additives that can selectively inhibit the formation of π-allyl complexes or β-H transfer processes.
4. Developing in-situ characterization techniques to monitor catalyst deactivation in real-time, allowing for better process control and optimization.
5. Computational studies to predict and model the energetics of competing reaction pathways, guiding the design of more stable catalyst systems.

These advancements could lead to the development of next-generation catalysts with improved stability, efficiency, and longevity, ultimately enhancing the economic viability and sustainability of alkene polymerization and metathesis processes.

Intramolecular C−H bond activation processes can also explain some deactivation processes of well-defined single-site supported catalysts. For instance, one deactivation pathway of supported alkene polymerization catalyst based on lanthanides and actinides probably is due to the activation of the allylic C−H bond in place of insertion of propene, thus yielding inactive π-allyl surface complexes (Scheme 22a). (66, 279, 280) More recently, it was shown that C−H bond activation could lead to the deactivation of silica supported alkene metathesis catalysts. (281) From kinetic and in situ spectroscopic studies in combination with calculations, it was shown that the well-defined silica supported Re-based alkene metathesis catalyst decomposed, leading to degrafting, and that this process is first order in ethene. The key step of this process probably involved the activation of the C−H bond in the β-position of the metallacyclobutane intermediates, a β-H transfer process (Scheme 22b). The resulting allyl hydride intermediate could then react with ethene to form a highly reactive species, which could either regenerate the catalyst via α-H abstraction between two adjacent alkyl ligands or degraft via abstraction of the β-H of the ethyl fragment by the siloxy ligand (β-H abstraction).

Additionally, β-H transfer can also lead to side reactions in hydrogenation with d0 metal-based supported (66, 242, 279, 280, 282, 283) and homogeneous catalysts. (284-286) In the latter case, it was shown that β-H transfer can become competitive with hydrogenolysis under low pressure of H2. This led to chain walking, as evidenced by the incorporation of deuterium at various positions of the alkyl chain when the reaction was performed with D2 in place of H2 (Scheme 22c).
Alkane Hydrogenolysis
The hydrogenolysis of alkanes and paraffins occurs catalytically at low temperatures on metal hydrides supported on various oxides, e.g. silica, silica−alumina, or alumina. In the case of group 4 metals and particularly Zr, based on selectivities at low conversions and the final product distribution (Table 2 and Scheme 23a, e.g. alkane = propane), the hydrogenolysis of alkanes has been proposed to take place with the following key steps: C−H bond activation of the alkane via σ-bond metathesis (vide supra), C−C bond activation via β-alkyl transfer, hydrogenolysis of the M−C bond, and hydrogenation of the alkene (composed of two elementary steps, insertion and hydrogenolysis, Scheme 23b). (229, 230, 232, 287-289) In order to account for the absence of alkenes and the relatively low reaction temperatures, an alternative pathway has been proposed from calculations based on the bis-hydride surface species, which avoids the high endothermic formation of alkene intermediates, a relatively thermodynamically disfavored process (Scheme 23c). (229, 230) It is clear, however, that β-alkyl transfer is the key C−C bond cleavage step, and this is further supported by the observed lack of hydrogenolysis activities toward ethane, for which the corresponding alkyl surface species (ethyl) does not possess a β−C-C bond. Moreover, cyclic alkanes having less than seven carbons (n < 1) do not undergo hydrogenolysis, which illustrates the requirement of a syn-coplanar arrangement of the M−C and C−C bonds in the β-alkyl transfer transition states (Scheme 23d). (290) Using other supports (silica−alumina (288) and alumina (291)) and group 4 metals (Ti (292) and Hf (293)) does not greatly affect the rate and the product distribution, which shows that β-alkyl transfer is a general C−C bond cleavage process for d0 group 4 metals.

It is noteworthy that this reaction can be extended to very long chain alkanes (C36) and polymers, and in fact, supported Zr hydrides can readily polymerize ethene and then depolymerize the thus-formed polyethylene under H2. (232, 288) For the hydrogenolysis of linear alkanes, the observed selectivities (Table 2) showed that C−C bond cleavage is statistical and occurs at similar rates from primary or secondary alkyl Zr species; for example, the ratio of ethane/(propane + methane) ≈ 2 (Scheme 24a). On the other hand, it is disfavored from tertiary alkyl Zr species, as evidenced by the low selectivity in isopentane in the hydrogenolysis of 3-methylpentane (Table 2 and Scheme 24b). (255)

Hydrogenolysis of alkanes is also catalyzed at low temperatures by silica supported tantalum hydrides, but the observed selectivities at low conversions and the final product distribution are very different (Table 3 and Scheme 25a). Moreover, the possibility of catalyzing the hydrogenolysis of ethane clearly shows that β-alkyl transfer cannot be the key C−C bond cleavage step in this case. (294) Here, based on these observations and calculations, the C−C bond activation step is the α-alkyl transfer, (295) and the elementary steps of hydrogenolysis are as follows: C−H bond activation, probably on a TaV trishydride species, via σ-bond metathesis, C−C bond cleavage through α-alkyl transfer, and hydrogenolysis (Scheme 25b−c). (296)
