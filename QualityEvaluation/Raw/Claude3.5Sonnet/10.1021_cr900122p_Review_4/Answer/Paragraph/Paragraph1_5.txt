Here's the analytical and comprehensive review section on propane dehydrogenation catalysts, focusing on the mechanisms and consequences of intramolecular C-H bond activation in the deactivation of supported alkene polymerization and metathesis catalysts:

<English>
Intramolecular C-H bond activation plays a crucial role in the deactivation of supported alkene polymerization and metathesis catalysts, with distinct mechanisms observed for lanthanide/actinide-based and silica-supported Re-based catalysts [10.1021/cr900122p_4]. This review focuses on the specific deactivation pathways and their implications for catalyst performance and longevity.

In the case of lanthanide and actinide-based supported alkene polymerization catalysts, the deactivation process involves the activation of the allylic C-H bond instead of the desired propene insertion. This mechanism results in the formation of inactive π-allyl surface complexes, effectively rendering the catalyst inoperative [10.1021/cr900122p_4]. The formation of these inactive complexes directly reduces the number of active sites available for polymerization, leading to a decrease in overall catalyst efficiency.

For silica-supported Re-based alkene metathesis catalysts, the deactivation mechanism is more intricate. The key step in this process involves the activation of the C-H bond in the β-position of metallacyclobutane intermediates, leading to a β-H transfer process. This results in the formation of an allyl hydride intermediate, which can subsequently react with ethene to create a highly reactive species [10.1021/cr900122p_4]. This reactive species can follow two competing pathways: it can either regenerate the catalyst through α-H abstraction between adjacent alkyl ligands or lead to degrafting via β-H abstraction of the ethyl fragment by the siloxy ligand.

The consequences of these deactivation pathways on catalyst performance and longevity are significant. For Re-based catalysts, the potential for degrafting can result in a loss of active catalyst from the support surface, gradually reducing the overall catalyst loading and activity over time. The competing pathways of catalyst regeneration and degrafting in these systems may lead to a progressive decline in performance as the reaction proceeds [10.1021/cr900122p_4].

Integrative understanding and prospective outlook: The elucidation of these deactivation mechanisms provides valuable insights for future catalyst design and optimization. Understanding the specific C-H activation processes that lead to catalyst deactivation opens up new avenues for developing more stable and efficient catalysts. Future research efforts may focus on:

1. Designing novel ligand structures that can minimize unwanted C-H activation processes while maintaining high catalytic activity.
2. Exploring alternative support materials that can better stabilize the active catalyst species and prevent degrafting.
3. Investigating the use of additives or co-catalysts that can selectively inhibit the deactivation pathways without compromising the desired catalytic reactions.
4. Developing in situ characterization techniques to monitor catalyst deactivation in real-time, allowing for better process control and optimization.
5. Applying computational modeling to predict and mitigate potential deactivation pathways in new catalyst designs.

These research directions could lead to the development of next-generation supported catalysts with enhanced stability, longevity, and performance in alkene polymerization and metathesis reactions.

分子内C-H键活化在支持型烯烃聚合和复分解催化剂的失活过程中起着至关重要的作用，其中镧系/锕系基催化剂和硅胶负载的Re基催化剂表现出不同的机理[10.1021/cr900122p_4]。本综述重点关注这些特定的失活途径及其对催化剂性能和寿命的影响。

对于镧系和锕系基支持型烯烃聚合催化剂，失活过程涉及烯丙基C-H键的活化，而不是期望的丙烯插入。这种机理导致形成无活性的π-烯丙基表面络合物，有效地使催化剂失去活性[10.1021/cr900122p_4]。这些无活性络合物的形成直接减少了可用于聚合的活性位点数量，导致催化剂整体效率下降。

对于硅胶负载的Re基烯烃复分解催化剂，失活机理更为复杂。这个过程的关键步骤涉及金属环丁烷中间体β位C-H键的活化，导致β-H转移过程。这导致形成烯丙基氢化物中间体，随后可与乙烯反应生成高活性物种[10.1021/cr900122p_4]。这种活性物种可以遵循两种竞争途径：要么通过相邻烷基配体之间的α-H抽提再生催化剂，要么通过硅氧基配体对乙基片段的β-H抽提导致脱附。

这些失活途径对催化剂性能和寿命的影响是显著的。对于Re基催化剂，脱附的可能性可能导致活性催化剂从支持表面流失，逐渐降低整体催化剂负载和活性。这些系统中催化剂再生和脱附的竞争途径可能导致反应进行过程中性能逐步下降[10.1021/cr900122p_4]。

综合理解与未来展望：对这些失活机理的阐明为未来催化剂设计和优化提供了宝贵的见解。了解导致催化剂失活的特定C-H活化过程为开发更稳定、更高效的催化剂开辟了新途径。未来的研究努力可能集中在：

1. 设计新型配体结构，在保持高催化活性的同时最大限度地减少不需要的C-H活化过程。
2. 探索可以更好地稳定活性催化剂物种并防止脱附的替代支持材料。
3. 研究使用可以选择性抑制失活途径而不影响所需催化反应的添加剂或助催化剂。
4. 开发实时监测催化剂失活的原位表征技术，以实现更好的过程控制和优化。
5. 应用计算模型来预测和缓解新催化剂设计中的潜在失活途径。

这些研究方向可能导致开发出下一代支持型催化剂，在烯烃聚合和复分解反应中具有增强的稳定性、寿命和性能。
