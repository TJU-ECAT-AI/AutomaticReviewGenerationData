Mechanisms and consequences of intramolecular C-H bond activation in the deactivation of supported alkene polymerization and metathesis catalysts, with emphasis on lanthanide/actinide-based and silica-supported Re-based systems

Intramolecular C-H bond activation processes play a crucial role in the deactivation of supported alkene polymerization and metathesis catalysts. This review focuses on the specific mechanisms involved in lanthanide/actinide-based and silica-supported Re-based catalysts, highlighting the key steps and consequences of these deactivation pathways.

For lanthanide and actinide-based supported alkene polymerization catalysts, the primary deactivation mechanism involves the activation of the allylic C-H bond instead of the desired propene insertion. This process leads to the formation of inactive π-allyl surface complexes, effectively deactivating the catalyst [10.1021/cr900122p_4]. The formation of these complexes directly reduces the number of active sites available for polymerization, resulting in a decrease in overall catalyst efficiency.

In contrast, silica-supported Re-based alkene metathesis catalysts exhibit a more complex deactivation mechanism. The key step in this process involves the activation of the C-H bond in the β-position of metallacyclobutane intermediates, leading to a β-H transfer process [10.1021/cr900122p_4]. This results in the formation of an allyl hydride intermediate, which can subsequently react with ethene to create a highly reactive species. This species can either regenerate the catalyst through α-H abstraction between adjacent alkyl ligands or lead to degrafting via β-H abstraction of the ethyl fragment by the siloxy ligand.

The key steps in these processes can be summarized as follows:
1. For lanthanide/actinide catalysts: Allylic C-H bond activation and formation of π-allyl surface complexes.
2. For Re-based catalysts: β-H transfer in metallacyclobutane intermediates, formation of allyl hydride intermediates, and potential degrafting through β-H abstraction.

These deactivation pathways have significant consequences for catalyst performance and longevity. In the case of lanthanide/actinide catalysts, the formation of inactive π-allyl complexes directly reduces the number of active sites available for polymerization, decreasing overall catalyst efficiency. For Re-based catalysts, the potential for degrafting can lead to a loss of active catalyst from the support surface, reducing the overall catalyst loading and activity over time [10.1021/cr900122p_4]. Additionally, the competing pathways of catalyst regeneration and degrafting in Re-based systems may result in a gradual decline in performance as the reaction progresses.

Integrative understanding and prospective outlook:
Understanding these deactivation mechanisms is crucial for developing strategies to improve catalyst stability and longevity. Future research endeavors might focus on:

1. Designing novel ligand structures that minimize unwanted C-H activation processes while maintaining catalytic activity.
2. Exploring alternative support materials that can stabilize the active catalyst species and prevent degrafting.
3. Investigating the use of additives or co-catalysts that can selectively inhibit deactivation pathways without compromising overall catalytic performance.
4. Developing in situ characterization techniques to monitor catalyst deactivation in real-time, allowing for better process control and optimization.
5. Computational studies to predict and model deactivation pathways, enabling the rational design of more stable catalyst systems.

By addressing these challenges, researchers can work towards developing more efficient and long-lasting supported alkene polymerization and metathesis catalysts, ultimately improving the sustainability and economic viability of these important industrial processes.
