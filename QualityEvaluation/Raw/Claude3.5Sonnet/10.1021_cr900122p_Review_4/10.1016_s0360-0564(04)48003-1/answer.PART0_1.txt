The provided literature does not contain any information specifically related to intramolecular C-H bond activation in the deactivation of supported alkene polymerization and metathesis catalysts, or the comparison between lanthanide/actinide-based and silica-supported Re-based catalysts. The document mainly focuses on isobutane/alkene alkylation catalyzed by liquid and solid acids, which is a different chemical process. There is no mention of π-allyl surface complexes, β-H transfer, or the specific deactivation mechanisms for the catalysts mentioned in the question. As such, this question cannot be adequately answered based on the given literature.

所提供的文献中没有包含任何与支持的烯烃聚合和复分解催化剂的分子内C-H键活化失活相关的信息,也没有对镧系/锕系基催化剂和硅胶负载的Re基催化剂进行比较。该文档主要集中在液体和固体酸催化的异丁烷/烯烃烷基化上,这是一个不同的化学过程。文中没有提到π-烯丙基表面络合物、β-H转移,或问题中提到的催化剂的具体失活机制。因此,无法根据给定的文献充分回答这个问题。
