Read the questions and answers provided below. First, critically assess the overall relevance of the answers provided to the set of questions asked.

If, upon your assessment, you find that the answers do not contain information that is relevant to the questions asked, stop your review process immediately and respond with a single sentence: "※※※※※※※The provided answers are not relevant to the questions.※※※※※※※". Do not provide any additional explanation or background information, only this sentence should be given as a response in case of irrelevant answers.

If, however, the answers are relevant to the questions asked, proceed to compile answers for each question according to the instructions below. Ensure to aggregate all the relevant answers from the multiple answer results provided in the document, and organize them sequentially by their order number, compiling the corresponding quotes, English answers, and Chinese answers for each question.

If the provided answers' quotes are not differentiated by question, ensure to break them down and assign the quotes to each respective question, outputting them separately within each question's section.

To provide a comprehensive review, differentiate the responses into quotes, English answers, and Chinese answers for each question based on the details given in the 'Answer' XML tags. Structure your review using the XML format showcased below if the answers are relevant to the questions asked:

<questions>

Analyze the role of intramolecular C-H bond activation in the deactivation of supported alkene polymerization and metathesis catalysts, comparing the specific mechanisms involved for lanthanide/actinide-based and silica-supported Re-based catalysts. Discuss the key steps in these processes, including the formation of π-allyl surface complexes and β-H transfer, and evaluate the potential consequences of these deactivation pathways on catalyst performance and longevity.

<EnglishVersionAnswer>

The given literature does not contain information specifically related to intramolecular C-H bond activation in the deactivation of supported alkene polymerization and metathesis catalysts. The text appears to focus on the conversion of ethane to aromatic hydrocarbons, and does not discuss lanthanide/actinide-based or silica-supported Re-based catalysts, π-allyl surface complexes, or β-H transfer in the context of catalyst deactivation. Therefore, this question cannot be adequately answered using the provided literature.

</EnglishVersionAnswer>

<ChineseVersionAnswer>

所提供的文献中没有包含关于支持的烯烃聚合和复分解催化剂中分子内C-H键活化导致失活的具体信息。该文本似乎主要关注乙烷向芳烃的转化,并未讨论镧系/锕系或二氧化硅负载的Re基催化剂、π-烯丙基表面络合物,或在催化剂失活背景下的β-H转移。因此,无法使用提供的文献充分回答这个问题。

<EnglishVersionAnswer>

The given literature does not contain any information relevant to analyzing the role of intramolecular C-H bond activation in the deactivation of supported alkene polymerization and metathesis catalysts. The text does not discuss lanthanide/actinide-based catalysts, silica-supported Re-based catalysts, π-allyl surface complexes, or β-H transfer. The document appears to focus on the conversion of ethane to aromatic hydrocarbons using different catalysts, particularly modified H-ZSM-5 zeolites. It does not cover the specific mechanisms of catalyst deactivation mentioned in the question. Therefore, this question cannot be accurately answered using only the information provided in the given literature.

</EnglishVersionAnswer>

<ChineseVersionAnswer>

给定的文献中没有包含任何与分析支持的烯烃聚合和复分解催化剂中分子内C-H键活化在失活中的作用相关的信息。文本没有讨论镧系/锕系催化剂、硅胶负载的Re基催化剂、π-烯丙基表面络合物或β-H转移。该文档似乎侧重于使用不同催化剂(特别是改性的H-ZSM-5沸石)将乙烷转化为芳烃。它没有涉及问题中提到的催化剂失活的具体机制。因此,仅使用给定文献中提供的信息无法准确回答这个问题。
