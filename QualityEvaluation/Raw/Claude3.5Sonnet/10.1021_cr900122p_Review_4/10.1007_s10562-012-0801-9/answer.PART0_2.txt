<EnglishVersionAnswer>

The given literature does not contain any information specifically addressing intramolecular C-H bond activation in the deactivation of supported alkene polymerization and metathesis catalysts, or comparing mechanisms for lanthanide/actinide-based and silica-supported Re-based catalysts. The document focuses on general advances in heterogeneous catalysis and does not discuss the specific catalytic systems and deactivation pathways mentioned in the question. Therefore, this question cannot be adequately answered based solely on the information provided in the given literature.
