<EnglishVersionAnswer>

The given literature does not contain any information about intramolecular C-H bond activation in the deactivation of supported alkene polymerization and metathesis catalysts, or about lanthanide/actinide-based and silica-supported Re-based catalysts. The document focuses on general trends and advances in heterogeneous catalysis, but does not go into specific detail about the mechanisms mentioned in the question. Therefore, this question cannot be answered based solely on the information provided in the given text.

给定的文献中没有关于支持的烯烃聚合和复分解催化剂失活过程中分子内C-H键活化的信息,也没有提到镧系/锕系和硅胶负载的Re基催化剂。该文档主要关注多相催化的总体趋势和进展,但没有详细讨论问题中提到的具体机制。因此,仅基于给定文本中提供的信息无法回答这个问题。
