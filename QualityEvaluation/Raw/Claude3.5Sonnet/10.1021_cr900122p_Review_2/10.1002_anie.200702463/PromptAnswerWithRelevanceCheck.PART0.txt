[1] "Catalytic reactions of hydrocarbons in zeolites can be profoundly affected by extraframework transition-metal cationic clusters. MFI zeolites containing dehydrogenating species such as gallium, zinc, and platinum form the basis for light alkane aromatization (Cyclar, Aroforming, Z-forming) processes."

[2] "Addition of water to the feed strongly increases the activity. The main product remains propylene, although with increasing water content slightly increased amounts of methane and ethylene are formed."

[3] "The promoting effect of water is due to the formation of reactive partly hydrolyzed gallium species."

[4] "In summary, addition of water to reduced Ga cations stabilizes binuclear hydroxyl-bridged Ga-containing cationic reaction intermediates. The increased acidity of the bridging hydroxyl bond and the stable tetrahedral configuration around Ga3+ ions facilitate H2 desorption."

The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations in several ways:

1. Composition: The presence of specific metals like gallium, zinc, and platinum in MFI zeolites enables light alkane aromatization processes. The choice of metal affects the type of reaction that can be catalyzed.

2. Structure: The formation of extraframework transition-metal cationic clusters in zeolites profoundly affects catalytic reactions of hydrocarbons. For gallium-based catalysts, the presence of binuclear hydroxyl-bridged Ga-containing cationic species plays a crucial role in enhancing catalytic activity.

3. Reaction conditions: The addition of water to the feed significantly increases catalytic activity. Water promotes the formation of reactive partly hydrolyzed gallium species, which are more effective in catalyzing alkane transformations.

4. Mechanism: The presence of water stabilizes binuclear hydroxyl-bridged Ga-containing cationic reaction intermediates. These intermediates have increased acidity of the bridging hydroxyl bond and a stable tetrahedral configuration around Ga3+ ions, which facilitates H2 desorption and improves the overall catalytic process.

5. Efficiency: The water-promoted formation of binuclear Ga species leads to enhanced catalytic activity and stability in alkane dehydrogenation reactions, as evidenced by increased propane conversion and stable operation over time.

These factors contribute to the industrial significance of metal-based catalysts in alkane transformations by improving catalytic activity, selectivity, and stability, which are crucial for efficient and economically viable industrial processes.

The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations in processes such as oxidative dehydrogenation and zeolite-catalyzed reactions. 

For Ga/ZSM-5 catalysts, the presence of water in the reaction feed leads to the transformation of single Ga+ centers into binuclear cationic Ga complexes with a Ga2O22+ core. This structural change enhances the rate of alkane activation and increases catalytic activity. 

The addition of steam to the feed substantially increases propane conversion, with optimal performance observed at a steam partial pressure of 0.3 kPa. This water-induced enhancement is due to the formation of reactive partly hydrolyzed gallium species.

The main product of propane conversion over Ga/ZSM-5 remains propylene, but increasing water content leads to slightly higher production of methane and ethylene. This suggests that water not only promotes the desired dehydrogenation reaction but also influences the overall product distribution.

The industrial significance of these catalysts is evident in their application to light alkane aromatization processes such as Cyclar, Aroforming, and Z-forming. The ability to fine-tune catalyst performance through controlled addition of water offers potential for optimizing industrial processes involving alkane transformations.

Factors contributing to the industrial significance of these catalysts include their stability under reaction conditions, the ability to control product selectivity, and the potential for improving conversion rates through careful manipulation of reaction conditions such as water content in the feed.

金属基催化剂的组成、结构和反应条件显著影响烷烃转化过程中的机理和效率，特别是在氧化脱氢和沸石催化反应等过程中。

对于Ga/ZSM-5催化剂，反应进料中水的存在导致单一Ga+中心转变为具有Ga2O22+核心的双核阳离子Ga复合物。这种结构变化提高了烷烃活化速率并增加了催化活性。

向进料中添加蒸汽可显著提高丙烷转化率，在蒸汽分压为0.3 kPa时观察到最佳性能。这种水诱导的增强是由于形成了部分水解的活性镓物种。

在Ga/ZSM-5上丙烷转化的主要产物仍然是丙烯，但随着水含量的增加，甲烷和乙烯的产量略有增加。这表明水不仅促进了所需的脱氢反应，还影响了整体产品分布。

这些催化剂的工业重要性体现在它们在轻烷烃芳构化过程中的应用，如Cyclar、Aroforming和Z-forming。通过控制水的添加来微调催化剂性能，为优化涉及烷烃转化的工业过程提供了潜力。

促进这些催化剂工业重要性的因素包括它们在反应条件下的稳定性、控制产品选择性的能力，以及通过仔细操控反应条件（如进料中的水含量）来提高转化率的潜力。

The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations in processes such as oxidative dehydrogenation and zeolite-catalyzed reactions. 

For metal-exchanged zeolites, particularly Ga/ZSM-5, the presence of extraframework transition-metal cationic clusters profoundly affects catalytic reactions of hydrocarbons. The nature of the active sites, whether mononuclear or multinuclear, plays a crucial role in the catalytic process. 

Reaction conditions, especially the presence of water, have a substantial impact on catalyst performance. Cofeeding of water leads to a significant increase in propane conversion, with optimal performance at a steam partial pressure of 0.3 kPa. The addition of water promotes the formation of reactive partly hydrolyzed gallium species, which enhances catalytic activity.

The structure of the active sites evolves under reaction conditions. In the presence of water, mononuclear gallium sites can transform into binuclear hydroxyl-bridged Ga-containing cationic reaction intermediates. These binuclear species facilitate H2 desorption, which is a key step in the dehydrogenation process.

The industrial significance of these catalysts stems from their ability to perform light alkane aromatization and dehydrogenation reactions efficiently. The stability of catalyst performance in the presence of steam over extended periods (at least 4 hours) further contributes to their industrial relevance.

The main product of propane dehydrogenation over Ga/ZSM-5 remains propylene, although the product distribution can be influenced by water content, with slight increases in methane and ethylene formation at higher water levels.

These factors collectively contribute to the efficiency and industrial significance of metal-based catalysts in alkane transformations, particularly in processes involving zeolite-catalyzed reactions and oxidative dehydrogenation.

在反应条件下，活性位点的结构会发生演变。在水存在的情况下，单核镓位点可以转化为双核羟基桥连的镓含阳离子反应中间体。这些双核物种有利于H2脱附，这是脱氢过程的关键步骤。
