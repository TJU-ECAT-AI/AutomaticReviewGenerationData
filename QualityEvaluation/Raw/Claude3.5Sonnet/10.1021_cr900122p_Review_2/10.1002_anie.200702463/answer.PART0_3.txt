[1] "Catalytic reactions of hydrocarbons in zeolites can be profoundly affected by extraframework transition-metal cationic clusters. MFI zeolites containing dehydrogenating species such as gallium, zinc, and platinum form the basis for light alkane aromatization (Cyclar, Aroforming, Z-forming) processes."

[2] "The water-induced enhancement in the rate of alkane activation by Ga/ZSM-5, as discussed herein, relates to transformation of these single Ga+ centers to binuclear cationic Ga complexes involving a Ga2O22+ core."

[3] "Clearly, cofeeding of water leads to a substantial increase of the propane conversion. The conversion passes a maximum at p of 0.3kPa. Catalyst performance in the presence of steam (0.3kPa) was found to be stable over a period of at least 4h."

[4] "Addition of water to the feed strongly increases the activity. The main product remains propylene, although with increasing water content slightly increased amounts of methane and ethylene are formed."

[5] "The promoting effect of water is due to the formation of reactive partly hydrolyzed gallium species. For mononuclear gallium sites, the catalytic cycle is initiated by desorption of H2 from [Ga3+(H)(OH)]+ to form the GaO+ ion."

The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations. For zeolite-catalyzed reactions, particularly those involving gallium-exchanged ZSM-5:

1. Composition: The presence of extraframework transition-metal cationic clusters, such as gallium, zinc, and platinum, in MFI zeolites enables light alkane aromatization processes.

2. Structure: The transformation of single Ga+ centers to binuclear cationic Ga complexes (Ga2O22+ core) enhances alkane activation rates.

3. Reaction conditions: The addition of water (steam) to the feed substantially increases propane conversion, with optimal performance at a steam partial pressure of 0.3 kPa. This water-induced enhancement is due to the formation of reactive, partly hydrolyzed gallium species.

4. Mechanism: The catalytic cycle is initiated by H2 desorption from [Ga3+(H)(OH)]+ to form GaO+ ions. The presence of water facilitates this process by promoting the formation of binuclear hydroxyl-bridged Ga-containing cationic reaction intermediates.

5. Efficiency: Water addition leads to increased activity and stable catalyst performance over time. The main product remains propylene, with slight increases in methane and ethylene formation at higher water content.

These factors contribute to the industrial significance of metal-exchanged zeolites in alkane transformation processes, as they allow for improved catalyst activity, stability, and product selectivity.

金属基催化剂的组成、结构和反应条件显著影响烷烃转化的机理和效率。对于沸石催化反应，特别是涉及镓交换ZSM-5的反应：

1. 组成：MFI沸石中存在的骨架外过渡金属阳离子簇（如镓、锌和铂）使得轻烷烃芳构化过程成为可能。

2. 结构：单一Ga+中心转化为双核阳离子Ga复合物（Ga2O22+核心）提高了烷烃活化速率。

3. 反应条件：向反应物中添加水（蒸汽）显著提高了丙烷转化率，在蒸汽分压为0.3 kPa时性能最佳。这种水诱导的增强效果是由于形成了反应性部分水解的镓物种。

4. 机理：催化循环由[Ga3+(H)(OH)]+脱氢形成GaO+离子开始。水的存在通过促进形成双核羟基桥连的镓含阳离子反应中间体来促进这一过程。

5. 效率：添加水导致活性增加和催化剂性能长期稳定。主要产物仍然是丙烯，但在水含量较高时甲烷和乙烯的生成量略有增加。

这些因素促进了金属交换沸石在烷烃转化过程中的工业重要性，因为它们能够提高催化剂活性、稳定性和产品选择性。
