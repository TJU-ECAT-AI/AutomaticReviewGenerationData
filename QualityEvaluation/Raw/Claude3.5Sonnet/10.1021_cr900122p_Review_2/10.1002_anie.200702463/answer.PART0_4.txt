[1] "Catalytic reactions of hydrocarbons in zeolites can be profoundly affected by extraframework transition-metal cationic clusters. MFI zeolites containing dehydrogenating species such as gallium, zinc, and platinum form the basis for light alkane aromatization (Cyclar, Aroforming, Z-forming) processes."

[2] "Recent experimental58 and computational913 studies have contributed to our understanding of the mechanism of alkane activation by single Ga Lewis acid sites. As candidate active sites, various mononuclear Ga-containing cations (Ga+, GaH2+, GaH2+, GaO+) have been considered."

[3] "Clearly, cofeeding of water leads to a substantial increase of the propane conversion. The conversion passes a maximum at p of 0.3kPa. Catalyst performance in the presence of steam (0.3kPa) was found to be stable over a period of at least 4h."

[4] "Addition of water to the feed strongly increases the activity. The main product remains propylene, although with increasing water content slightly increased amounts of methane and ethylene are formed."

[5] "The promoting effect of water is due to the formation of reactive partly hydrolyzed gallium species. For mononuclear gallium sites, the catalytic cycle is initiated by desorption of H2 from [Ga3+(H)(OH)]+ to form the GaO+ ion."

The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations in processes such as oxidative dehydrogenation and zeolite-catalyzed reactions. 

For metal-exchanged zeolites, particularly Ga/ZSM-5, the presence of extraframework transition-metal cationic clusters profoundly affects catalytic reactions of hydrocarbons. The nature of the active sites, whether mononuclear or multinuclear, plays a crucial role in the catalytic process. 

Reaction conditions, especially the presence of water, have a substantial impact on catalyst performance. Cofeeding of water leads to a significant increase in propane conversion, with optimal performance at a steam partial pressure of 0.3 kPa. The addition of water promotes the formation of reactive partly hydrolyzed gallium species, which enhances catalytic activity.

The structure of the active sites evolves under reaction conditions. In the presence of water, mononuclear gallium sites can transform into binuclear hydroxyl-bridged Ga-containing cationic reaction intermediates. These binuclear species facilitate H2 desorption, which is a key step in the dehydrogenation process.

The industrial significance of these catalysts stems from their ability to perform light alkane aromatization and dehydrogenation reactions efficiently. The stability of catalyst performance in the presence of steam over extended periods (at least 4 hours) further contributes to their industrial relevance.

The main product of propane dehydrogenation over Ga/ZSM-5 remains propylene, although the product distribution can be influenced by water content, with slight increases in methane and ethylene formation at higher water levels.

These factors collectively contribute to the efficiency and industrial significance of metal-based catalysts in alkane transformations, particularly in processes involving zeolite-catalyzed reactions and oxidative dehydrogenation.

金属基催化剂的组成、结构和反应条件对烷烃转化过程中的机理和效率产生显著影响，尤其是在氧化脱氢和沸石催化反应等过程中。

对于金属交换沸石，特别是Ga/ZSM-5，骨架外过渡金属阳离子簇的存在深刻影响了烃类的催化反应。活性位点的性质，无论是单核还是多核，在催化过程中都起着至关重要的作用。

反应条件，尤其是水的存在，对催化剂性能有显著影响。共进料水导致丙烷转化率显著提高，在水蒸气分压为0.3 kPa时性能最佳。水的加入促进了反应性部分水解镓物种的形成，从而增强了催化活性。

在反应条件下，活性位点的结构会发生演变。在水存在的情况下，单核镓位点可以转化为双核羟基桥连的镓含阳离子反应中间体。这些双核物种有利于H2脱附，这是脱氢过程的关键步骤。

这些催化剂的工业重要性源于它们能够高效地进行轻烷烃芳构化和脱氢反应。在蒸汽存在的情况下，催化剂性能在长时间内（至少4小时）保持稳定，进一步增加了它们的工业相关性。

Ga/ZSM-5上丙烷脱氢的主要产物仍然是丙烯，尽管产品分布可能受水含量的影响，在较高水平下甲烷和乙烯的生成量略有增加。

这些因素共同影响了金属基催化剂在烷烃转化中的效率和工业重要性，特别是在涉及沸石催化反应和氧化脱氢的过程中。
