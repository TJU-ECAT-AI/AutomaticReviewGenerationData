[1] "Catalytic reactions of hydrocarbons in zeolites can be profoundly affected by extraframework transition-metal cationic clusters. MFI zeolites containing dehydrogenating species such as gallium, zinc, and platinum form the basis for light alkane aromatization (Cyclar, Aroforming, Z-forming) processes."

[2] "Addition of water to the feed strongly increases the activity. The main product remains propylene, although with increasing water content slightly increased amounts of methane and ethylene are formed."

[3] "The promoting effect of water is due to the formation of reactive partly hydrolyzed gallium species."

[4] "In summary, addition of water to reduced Ga cations stabilizes binuclear hydroxyl-bridged Ga-containing cationic reaction intermediates. The increased acidity of the bridging hydroxyl bond and the stable tetrahedral configuration around Ga3+ ions facilitate H2 desorption."

The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations in several ways:

1. Composition: The presence of specific metals like gallium, zinc, and platinum in MFI zeolites enables light alkane aromatization processes. The choice of metal affects the type of reaction that can be catalyzed.

2. Structure: The formation of extraframework transition-metal cationic clusters in zeolites profoundly affects catalytic reactions of hydrocarbons. For gallium-based catalysts, the presence of binuclear hydroxyl-bridged Ga-containing cationic species plays a crucial role in enhancing catalytic activity.

3. Reaction conditions: The addition of water to the feed significantly increases catalytic activity. Water promotes the formation of reactive partly hydrolyzed gallium species, which are more effective in catalyzing alkane transformations.

4. Mechanism: The presence of water stabilizes binuclear hydroxyl-bridged Ga-containing cationic reaction intermediates. These intermediates have increased acidity of the bridging hydroxyl bond and a stable tetrahedral configuration around Ga3+ ions, which facilitates H2 desorption and improves the overall catalytic process.

5. Efficiency: The water-promoted formation of binuclear Ga species leads to enhanced catalytic activity and stability in alkane dehydrogenation reactions, as evidenced by increased propane conversion and stable operation over time.

These factors contribute to the industrial significance of metal-based catalysts in alkane transformations by improving catalytic activity, selectivity, and stability, which are crucial for efficient and economically viable industrial processes.
