          [1] "Catalytic reactions of hydrocarbons in zeolites can be profoundly affected by extraframework transition-metal cationic clusters. MFI zeolites containing dehydrogenating species such as gallium, zinc, and platinum form the basis for light alkane aromatization (Cyclar, Aroforming, Z-forming) processes."

[2] "The water-induced enhancement in the rate of alkane activation by Ga/ZSM-5, as discussed herein, relates to transformation of these single Ga+ centers to binuclear cationic Ga complexes involving a Ga2O22+ core."

[3] "Clearly, cofeeding of water leads to a substantial increase of the propane conversion. The conversion passes a maximum at p of 0.3kPa. Catalyst performance in the presence of steam (0.3kPa) was found to be stable over a period of at least 4h."

[4] "Addition of water to the feed strongly increases the activity. The main product remains propylene, although with increasing water content slightly increased amounts of methane and ethylene are formed."

[5] "The promoting effect of water is due to the formation of reactive partly hydrolyzed gallium species. For mononuclear gallium sites, the catalytic cycle is initiated by desorption of H2 from [Ga3+(H)(OH)]+ to form the GaO+ ion."

[6] "Dehydrogenation of an alkane over the Ga2O2 dimer proceeds by initial heterolytic dissociation by the Lewis acid pair formed by Ga3+ and the basic extraframework oxygen atom (Scheme1) with subsequent olefin desorption and hydrogen recombination."

[7] "In summary, addition of water to reduced Ga cations stabilizes binuclear hydroxyl-bridged Ga-containing cationic reaction intermediates. The increased acidity of the bridging hydroxyl bond and the stable tetrahedral configuration around Ga3+ ions facilitate H2 desorption."

          The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts, particularly supported vanadium oxides and metal-exchanged zeolites, significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations in processes such as oxidative dehydrogenation and zeolite-catalyzed reactions:

1. Composition: MFI zeolites containing dehydrogenating species such as gallium, zinc, and platinum form the basis for light alkane aromatization processes. The choice of metal affects the type of reaction catalyzed.

2. Structure: The presence of extraframework transition-metal cationic clusters profoundly affects catalytic reactions of hydrocarbons in zeolites. For Ga/ZSM-5 catalysts, the transformation of single Ga+ centers to binuclear cationic Ga complexes with a Ga2O22+ core enhances alkane activation rates.

3. Reaction conditions: The addition of water to the feed significantly increases catalytic activity. Optimal performance is observed at a steam partial pressure of 0.3 kPa, with stable catalyst performance over extended periods.

4. Mechanism: The catalytic cycle for mononuclear gallium sites is initiated by H2 desorption from [Ga3+(H)(OH)]+ to form GaO+ ions. For binuclear sites, alkane dehydrogenation proceeds through initial heterolytic dissociation by the Lewis acid pair (Ga3+ and basic extraframework oxygen), followed by olefin desorption and hydrogen recombination.

5. Efficiency: Water addition leads to increased propane conversion and propylene selectivity, with slight increases in methane and ethylene formation at higher water contents. The water-induced enhancement is due to the formation of reactive partly hydrolyzed gallium species and the stabilization of binuclear hydroxyl-bridged Ga-containing cationic reaction intermediates.

These factors contribute to the industrial significance of such catalysts by enhancing their activity, stability, and selectivity in alkane transformation processes. The ability to tune catalyst performance through composition and reaction conditions, particularly water content, makes these systems valuable for industrial applications in hydrocarbon processing.

          金属基催化剂的组成、结构和反应条件，特别是负载的钒氧化物和金属交换沸石，显著影响烷烃转化过程中的机理和效率，尤其是在氧化脱氢和沸石催化反应等过程中：

1. 组成：含有脱氢物种（如镓、锌和铂）的MFI沸石是轻烷烃芳构化过程的基础。金属的选择影响可以催化的反应类型。

2. 结构：沸石中骨架外过渡金属阳离子簇的存在深刻影响了烃类的催化反应。对于Ga/ZSM-5催化剂，单一Ga+中心转化为具有Ga2O22+核心的双核阳离子Ga复合物提高了烷烃活化速率。

3. 反应条件：向进料中添加水显著提高了催化活性。在水蒸气分压为0.3 kPa时观察到最佳性能，催化剂性能在较长时间内保持稳定。

4. 机理：对于单核镓位点，催化循环由[Ga3+(H)(OH)]+脱氢形成GaO+离子开始。对于双核位点，烷烃脱氢通过Lewis酸对（Ga3+和骨架外碱性氧）的初始异裂解离进行，随后是烯烃脱附和氢重组。

5. 效率：添加水导致丙烷转化率和丙烯选择性增加，在较高水含量下甲烷和乙烯的生成量略有增加。水诱导的增强效果是由于形成了反应性部分水解的镓物种，并稳定了双核羟基桥连的镓含阳离子反应中间体。

这些因素通过提高烷烃转化过程中催化剂的活性、稳定性和选择性，增加了这类催化剂的工业重要性。通过组成和反应条件（特别是水含量）调节催化剂性能的能力，使得这些系统在碳氢化合物加工的工业应用中极具价值。
