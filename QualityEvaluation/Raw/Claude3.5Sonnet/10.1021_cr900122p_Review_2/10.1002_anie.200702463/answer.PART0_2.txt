[1] "Catalytic reactions of hydrocarbons in zeolites can be profoundly affected by extraframework transition-metal cationic clusters. MFI zeolites containing dehydrogenating species such as gallium, zinc, and platinum form the basis for light alkane aromatization (Cyclar, Aroforming, Z-forming) processes."

[2] "Addition of water to the feed strongly increases the activity. The main product remains propylene, although with increasing water content slightly increased amounts of methane and ethylene are formed."

[3] "The promoting effect of water is due to the formation of reactive partly hydrolyzed gallium species."

[4] "We propose that multinuclear Ga sites are formed. To clarify whether such species can be generated upon water adsorption and whether their formation facilitates hydrogen desorption, we studied the interaction of two distantly placed Ga+ ions with H2O by quantum-chemical cluster calculations in the DFT formalism."

[5] "Dehydrogenation of an alkane over the Ga2O2 dimer proceeds by initial heterolytic dissociation by the Lewis acid pair formed by Ga3+ and the basic extraframework oxygen atom (Scheme1) with subsequent olefin desorption and hydrogen recombination."

The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations. For zeolite-catalyzed reactions, particularly those involving gallium-exchanged ZSM-5:

1. Composition: The presence of extraframework transition-metal cationic clusters, such as gallium, zinc, and platinum, in MFI zeolites forms the basis for light alkane aromatization processes.

2. Structure: The formation of multinuclear gallium sites, specifically Ga2O2 dimers, plays a crucial role in the catalytic activity. These dimers are formed through the interaction of Ga+ ions with water.

3. Reaction conditions: The addition of water to the feed significantly increases catalytic activity. Water promotes the formation of reactive partly hydrolyzed gallium species.

4. Mechanism: Alkane dehydrogenation over the Ga2O2 dimer proceeds through initial heterolytic dissociation by the Lewis acid pair (Ga3+ and basic extraframework oxygen), followed by olefin desorption and hydrogen recombination.

5. Efficiency: The presence of water leads to increased propane conversion and propylene selectivity, with some increase in methane and ethylene formation at higher water contents.

These factors contribute to the industrial significance of such catalysts by enhancing their activity, stability, and selectivity in alkane transformation processes. The ability to tune catalyst performance through composition and reaction conditions makes these systems valuable for industrial applications in hydrocarbon processing.

金属基催化剂的组成、结构和反应条件对烷烃转化的机理和效率有显著影响。对于沸石催化反应，特别是涉及镓交换ZSM-5的反应：

1. 组成：MFI沸石中存在的骨架外过渡金属阳离子簇，如镓、锌和铂，是轻烷烃芳构化过程的基础。

2. 结构：多核镓位点的形成，特别是Ga2O2二聚体，在催化活性中起着关键作用。这些二聚体是通过Ga+离子与水的相互作用形成的。

3. 反应条件：向进料中添加水能显著提高催化活性。水促进了部分水解的活性镓物种的形成。

4. 机理：在Ga2O2二聚体上的烷烃脱氢过程通过Lewis酸对（Ga3+和骨架外碱性氧）的初始异裂解离进行，随后是烯烃脱附和氢重组。

5. 效率：水的存在导致丙烷转化率和丙烯选择性增加，在较高水含量下甲烷和乙烯的生成也略有增加。

这些因素通过提高烷烃转化过程中催化剂的活性、稳定性和选择性，提升了这类催化剂的工业重要性。通过组成和反应条件调节催化剂性能的能力使得这些系统在碳氢化合物加工的工业应用中极具价值。
