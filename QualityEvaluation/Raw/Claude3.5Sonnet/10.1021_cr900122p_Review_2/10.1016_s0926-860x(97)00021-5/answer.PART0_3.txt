[1] "Supported vanadium oxide catalysts, containing surface vanadia species on oxide supports, are extensively employed as catalysts for many hydrocarbon oxidation reactions."

[2] "The characteristics of the bridging V-O-support bond can be altered by varying the specific oxide support or oxide support ligands without changing the structure of the surface vanadia species (with the exception of silica)."

[3] "The bridging V-O-support bond appears to be associated with the critical oxygen required for hydrocarbon oxidation reactions since changing the specific oxide support dramatically affects the TOF: approximately four orders of magnitude for methanol oxidation to formaldehyde and two-orders of magnitude for butane oxidation to maleic anhydride."

[4] "The general trend appears to be CeO2>ZrO2>TiO2>Nb2O5>Al2O3>SiO2, which inversely correlates with the Sanderson electronegativity of the oxide support cations."

[5] "An increase in the TOF with the surface vanadia coverage may reflect the requirement of multiple surface vanadia sites or the influence of other factors (e.g., surface acidity, influence of bridging V-O-V bonds, structural changes, etc.)."

[6] "The addition of surface niobia is especially informative since it has a minimal effect on the surface vanadia structure, see Section 5.6 above, and its presence primarily increases the number of adjacent surface metal oxide sites for the surface vanadia species."

[7] "Interacting additives affect all hydrocarbon oxidation reactions since they directly alter the structure and reactivity of the surface vanadia sites."

The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of supported vanadium oxide catalysts significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations, particularly in oxidative dehydrogenation processes. The key factors contributing to their industrial significance include:

1. Support material: The choice of oxide support (e.g., CeO2, ZrO2, TiO2, Nb2O5, Al2O3, SiO2) dramatically affects the catalyst's turnover frequency (TOF) by altering the characteristics of the bridging V-O-support bond. This bond is critical for hydrocarbon oxidation reactions, with the TOF varying by up to four orders of magnitude depending on the support.

2. Surface vanadia coverage: Increasing the surface vanadia coverage can enhance the TOF for certain reactions, possibly due to the requirement of multiple surface vanadia sites or other factors such as surface acidity and structural changes.

3. Additives: Non-interacting additives like surface niobia can increase the number of adjacent surface metal oxide sites, potentially improving catalyst performance for reactions requiring multiple sites. Interacting additives directly alter the structure and reactivity of surface vanadia sites, affecting all hydrocarbon oxidation reactions.

4. Support electronegativity: The reactivity trend of supported vanadia catalysts inversely correlates with the Sanderson electronegativity of the oxide support cations, suggesting that more basic bridging oxygens in V-O-support bonds are associated with higher reactivity.

These factors contribute to the industrial significance of supported vanadium oxide catalysts by allowing for the tuning of catalyst properties to optimize performance for specific hydrocarbon oxidation reactions. The ability to control the number and type of active sites, as well as the electronic properties of the catalyst surface, enables the development of highly efficient and selective catalysts for various industrial processes.

负载型钒氧化物催化剂的组成、结构和反应条件显著影响烷烃转化的机理和效率，特别是在氧化脱氢过程中。以下是影响其工业重要性的关键因素：

1. 载体材料：氧化物载体的选择（如CeO2、ZrO2、TiO2、Nb2O5、Al2O3、SiO2）通过改变V-O-载体桥键的特性，显著影响催化剂的转化频率（TOF）。这种键对碳氢化合物氧化反应至关重要，不同载体可使TOF变化高达四个数量级。

2. 表面钒物种覆盖度：增加表面钒物种覆盖度可能会提高某些反应的TOF，这可能是由于需要多个表面钒位点或其他因素如表面酸度和结构变化所致。

3. 添加剂：非相互作用的添加剂（如表面铌物种）可以增加相邻表面金属氧化物位点的数量，潜在地改善需要多个位点的反应的催化性能。相互作用的添加剂直接改变表面钒物种的结构和反应性，影响所有碳氢化合物氧化反应。

4. 载体电负性：负载型钒催化剂的反应性趋势与氧化物载体阳离子的Sanderson电负性呈反相关，表明V-O-载体键中更碱性的桥接氧与更高的反应性相关。

这些因素通过允许调整催化剂性质以优化特定碳氢化合物氧化反应的性能，从而促进了负载型钒氧化物催化剂的工业重要性。控制活性位点的数量和类型以及催化剂表面电子性质的能力，使得可以为各种工业过程开发高效和高选择性的催化剂。
