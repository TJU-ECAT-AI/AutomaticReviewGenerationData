[1] "Supported vanadium oxide catalysts contain a vanadia phase deposited on the surface of an oxide support (e.g., A1203, TiO2, SIO2, etc.)."

[2] "The molecular structures of the surface vanadia species are tentatively thought to consist of a terminal V=O bond and three bridging V-O-support bonds for the isolated species, and a terminal V=O bond with one bridging V-O-support and two bridging V-O-V bonds for the polymerized species."

[3] "The bridging V-O-support bond appears to be the most critical bond since its properties can change the TOF for hydrocarbon oxidation reactions by as much as four orders of magnitude."

[4] "The reactivity of the surface vanadia species is strongly influenced by the specific oxide support since the same dehydrated surface vanadia species are present on all the supports with the exception of silica."

[5] "The general trend appears to be CeOz>ZrO2 TiO2>NbzOs>A12Os>SiO2, which inversely correlates with the Sanderson electronegativity of the oxide support cations."

[6] "Oxidation reactions requiring only one surface vanadia sites are generally not sensitive to the surface vanadia coverage and the presence of noninteracting metal oxide additives. Oxidation reactions requiring multiple surface vanadia sites are very sensitive to surface vanadia coverage and the presence of noninteracting metal oxide additives."

The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of supported vanadium oxide catalysts significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations, particularly in oxidative dehydrogenation processes. Key factors contributing to their industrial significance include:

1. Support material: The choice of oxide support (e.g., Al2O3, TiO2, SiO2) greatly affects catalyst performance. The bridging V-O-support bond is critical, as it can change the turnover frequency (TOF) for hydrocarbon oxidation reactions by up to four orders of magnitude.

2. Surface structure: The surface vanadia species typically consist of isolated species with a terminal V=O bond and three bridging V-O-support bonds, or polymerized species with a terminal V=O bond, one V-O-support bond, and two V-O-V bonds.

3. Support electronegativity: The reactivity trend (CeO2 > ZrO2 > TiO2 > Nb2O5 > Al2O3 > SiO2) inversely correlates with the Sanderson electronegativity of the oxide support cations, affecting the basicity of the bridging oxygens.

4. Surface coverage and additives: The sensitivity to surface vanadia coverage and non-interacting metal oxide additives depends on whether the reaction requires single or multiple surface vanadia sites.

5. Reaction conditions: Factors such as temperature, gas composition, and the presence of moisture can affect the structure and oxidation state of the surface vanadia species, influencing their catalytic performance.

These factors contribute to the industrial significance of supported vanadium oxide catalysts by allowing for the tuning of catalyst properties to optimize performance in specific alkane transformation processes.

负载钒氧化物催化剂的组成、结构和反应条件对烷烃转化的机理和效率有显著影响，尤其是在氧化脱氢过程中。以下是影响其工业重要性的关键因素：

1. 载体材料：氧化物载体的选择（如Al2O3、TiO2、SiO2）极大地影响催化剂性能。桥接V-O-载体键至关重要，它可以使烃类氧化反应的转化频率（TOF）变化高达四个数量级。

2. 表面结构：表面钒物种通常由具有末端V=O键和三个桥接V-O-载体键的孤立物种，或具有末端V=O键、一个V-O-载体键和两个V-O-V键的聚合物种组成。

3. 载体电负性：反应活性趋势（CeO2 > ZrO2 > TiO2 > Nb2O5 > Al2O3 > SiO2）与氧化物载体阳离子的Sanderson电负性呈反相关，影响桥接氧的碱性。

4. 表面覆盖度和添加剂：对表面钒覆盖度和非相互作用金属氧化物添加剂的敏感性取决于反应是需要单个还是多个表面钒位点。

5. 反应条件：温度、气体组成和水分的存在等因素可影响表面钒物种的结构和氧化态，从而影响其催化性能。

这些因素通过允许调整催化剂性能以优化特定烷烃转化过程的性能，从而提高了负载钒氧化物催化剂的工业重要性。
