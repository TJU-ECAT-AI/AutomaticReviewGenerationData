[1] "Supported vanadium oxide catalysts contain a vanadia phase deposited on the surface of an oxide support (e.g., A1203, TiO2, SIO2, etc.)."

[2] "The molecular structures of these surface vanadia species are tentatively thought to consist of a terminal V=O bond and three bridging V-O-support bonds for the isolated species, and a terminal V=O bond with one bridging V-O-support and two bridging V-O-V bonds for the polymerized species."

[3] "The bridging V-O-support bond appears to be associated with the critical oxygen required for hydrocarbon oxidation reactions since changing the specific oxide support dramatically affects the TOF: approximately four orders of magnitude for methanol oxidation to formaldehyde and two-orders of magnitude for butane oxidation to maleic anhydride."

[4] "The general trend appears to be CeOz>ZrO2 TiO2>NbzOs>A12Os>SiO2, which inversely correlates with the Sanderson electronegativity of the oxide support cations."

[5] "As a result of these physical and chemical characteristics, supported vanadia catalysts tend to be among the most active and selective supported metal oxide catalysts for hydrocarbon oxidation reactions."

The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of supported vanadium oxide catalysts significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations, particularly in oxidative dehydrogenation processes. Key factors include:

1. Support material: The choice of oxide support (e.g., Al2O3, TiO2, SiO2) dramatically affects catalyst performance, with TOF varying by up to four orders of magnitude for methanol oxidation and two orders of magnitude for butane oxidation to maleic anhydride.

2. Surface vanadia species structure: Isolated species consist of a terminal V=O bond and three bridging V-O-support bonds, while polymerized species have a terminal V=O bond, one bridging V-O-support bond, and two bridging V-O-V bonds.

3. Bridging V-O-support bond: This bond appears to contain the critical oxygen required for hydrocarbon oxidation reactions. The reactivity trend (CeO2 > ZrO2 > TiO2 > Nb2O5 > Al2O3 > SiO2) inversely correlates with the Sanderson electronegativity of the oxide support cations.

4. Surface density: Supported vanadia catalysts have a higher surface density compared to other supported metal oxide catalysts, increasing the number of active sites and minimizing unwanted side reactions.

5. Acidity: The weak acidic character of bulk vanadia may help minimize unwanted side reactions.

These factors contribute to the industrial significance of supported vanadia catalysts, making them among the most active and selective supported metal oxide catalysts for hydrocarbon oxidation reactions.

负载型钒氧化物催化剂的组成、结构和反应条件对烷烃转化的机理和效率有显著影响，特别是在氧化脱氢过程中。主要影响因素包括：

1. 载体材料：氧化物载体的选择（如Al2O3、TiO2、SiO2）对催化剂性能有显著影响，甲醇氧化的TOF可相差四个数量级，丁烷氧化生成马来酸酐的TOF可相差两个数量级。

2. 表面钒物种结构：孤立物种由一个端基V=O键和三个桥接V-O-载体键组成，而聚合物种有一个端基V=O键、一个桥接V-O-载体键和两个桥接V-O-V键。

3. 桥接V-O-载体键：这种键似乎包含了烃类氧化反应所需的关键氧。反应活性趋势（CeO2 > ZrO2 > TiO2 > Nb2O5 > Al2O3 > SiO2）与氧化物载体阳离子的Sanderson电负性呈反比。

4. 表面密度：与其他负载型金属氧化物催化剂相比，负载型钒催化剂具有更高的表面密度，增加了活性位点数量，并最大限度地减少了不必要的副反应。

5. 酸度：块状钒的弱酸性可能有助于最小化不必要的副反应。

这些因素共同促进了负载型钒催化剂的工业重要性，使其成为烃类氧化反应中最活跃和选择性最高的负载型金属氧化物催化剂之一。
