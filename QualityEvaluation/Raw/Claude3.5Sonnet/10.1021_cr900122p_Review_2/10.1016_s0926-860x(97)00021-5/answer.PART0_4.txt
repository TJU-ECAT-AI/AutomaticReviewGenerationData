[1] "Supported vanadium oxide catalysts, containing surface vanadia species on oxide supports, are extensively employed as catalysts for many hydrocarbon oxidation reactions."

[2] "The reactivity properties of the supported vanadia catalysts will be compared with the corresponding structural information presented above (see Section 5) in order to develop molecular structure-reactivity/selectivity relationships for supported vanadia catalysts during hydrocarbon oxidation reactions."

[3] "The bridging V-O-support bond appears to be associated with the critical oxygen required for hydrocarbon oxidation reactions since changing the specific oxide support dramatically affects the TOF: approximately four orders of magnitude for methanol oxidation to formaldehyde and two-orders of magnitude for butane oxidation to maleic anhydride."

[4] "The general trend appears to be CeO2>ZrO2≈TiO2>Nb2O5>Al2O3>SiO2, which inversely correlates with the Sanderson electronegativity of the oxide support cations."

[5] "The oxidation of butane to maleic anhydride does show a slight enhancement in activity and selectivity with surface vanadia coverage, but this is mostly due to the requirement of multiple surface vanadia sites for this reaction rather than surface acidity properties."

[6] "Acidic and basic additives also influence the selectivity of hydrocarbon oxidation reactions, but the effect appears to be reaction specific and cannot be generalized with the limited data currently available."

The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of supported vanadium oxide catalysts significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations, particularly in oxidative dehydrogenation processes. Key factors contributing to their industrial significance include:

1. The nature of the oxide support: Different oxide supports (CeO2, ZrO2, TiO2, Nb2O5, Al2O3, SiO2) dramatically affect the turnover frequency (TOF) of reactions, with differences of up to four orders of magnitude observed for methanol oxidation to formaldehyde and two orders of magnitude for butane oxidation to maleic anhydride.

2. The bridging V-O-support bond: This bond appears to be critical for hydrocarbon oxidation reactions, with its properties strongly influenced by the specific oxide support used.

3. Surface vanadia coverage: For some reactions, such as butane oxidation to maleic anhydride, increased surface vanadia coverage enhances activity and selectivity due to the requirement for multiple surface vanadia sites.

4. Additives: Both acidic and basic additives influence the selectivity of hydrocarbon oxidation reactions, though their effects are reaction-specific and not yet fully understood.

5. Structural characteristics: The molecular structure of surface vanadia species, including the presence of terminal V=O bonds, bridging V-O-V bonds, and V-O-support bonds, all play roles in determining catalytic performance.

These factors contribute to the industrial significance of supported vanadium oxide catalysts by allowing for the tuning of catalytic properties to optimize performance for specific reactions. However, the complexity of these systems, particularly when using industrial-grade supports with impurities, necessitates careful study to fully understand and exploit their potential in alkane transformations.

负载钒氧化物催化剂的组成、结构和反应条件显著影响烷烃转化的机理和效率，特别是在氧化脱氢过程中。以下是对其工业重要性有贡献的关键因素：

1. 氧化物载体的性质：不同的氧化物载体（CeO2, ZrO2, TiO2, Nb2O5, Al2O3, SiO2）对反应的转化频率（TOF）有显著影响，在甲醇氧化制甲醛和丁烷氧化制马来酸酐的反应中，可观察到高达四个数量级和两个数量级的差异。

2. V-O-载体桥键：这种键对碳氢化合物氧化反应至关重要，其性质受所使用的特定氧化物载体的强烈影响。

3. 表面钒氧化物覆盖度：对于某些反应，如丁烷氧化制马来酸酐，增加表面钒氧化物覆盖度可以提高活性和选择性，这是由于该反应需要多个表面钒氧化物位点。

4. 添加剂：酸性和碱性添加剂都会影响碳氢化合物氧化反应的选择性，但它们的影响是特定于反应的，目前还没有完全理解。

5. 结构特征：表面钒氧化物物种的分子结构，包括端基V=O键、桥接V-O-V键和V-O-载体键的存在，都在决定催化性能方面发挥作用。

这些因素通过允许调整催化性能以优化特定反应的性能，为负载钒氧化物催化剂的工业重要性做出了贡献。然而，这些系统的复杂性，特别是在使用含有杂质的工业级载体时，需要仔细研究以充分理解和利用它们在烷烃转化中的潜力。
