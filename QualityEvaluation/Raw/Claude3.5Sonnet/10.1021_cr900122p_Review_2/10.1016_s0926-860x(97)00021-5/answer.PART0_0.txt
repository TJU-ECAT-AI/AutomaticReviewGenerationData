[1] "Supported vanadium oxide catalysts, containing surface vanadia species on oxide supports, are extensively employed as catalysts for many hydrocarbon oxidation reactions."

[2] "The driving force for the stability of the surface vanadia monolayer is the lower free energy of this structural arrangement than the exposed high surface area oxide supports"

[3] "The bridging V-O-support bond appears to be associated with the critical oxygen required for hydrocarbon oxidation reactions since changing the specific oxide support dramatically affects the TOF: approximately four orders of magnitude for methanol oxidation to formaldehyde and two-orders of magnitude for butane oxidation to maleic anhydride."

[4] "This suggests that bridging oxygens in V-O-support bonds that are more electronegative or basic, corresponding to oxide support cations with a lower electronegativity, are associated with the critical oxygen required for hydrocarbon oxidation reactions over supported vanadia catalysts."

[5] "The oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propylene over V2O5/Nb2O5 was not dependent on the concentration of the bridging V-O-V bonds"

[6] "As a result of these physical and chemical characteristics, supported vanadia catalysts tend to be among the most active and selective supported metal oxide catalysts for hydrocarbon oxidation reactions."

The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of supported vanadium oxide catalysts significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations, particularly in oxidative dehydrogenation processes. Key factors include:

1. Support material: The choice of oxide support dramatically affects the turnover frequency (TOF) of reactions, with changes of up to four orders of magnitude observed for different supports. This is primarily due to the influence of the bridging V-O-support bond.

2. Electronegativity of support: Bridging oxygens in V-O-support bonds that are more electronegative or basic, corresponding to oxide support cations with lower electronegativity, are associated with the critical oxygen required for hydrocarbon oxidation reactions.

3. Surface coverage: The concentration of bridging V-O-V bonds, which increases with surface vanadia coverage, does not significantly affect some reactions like propane oxidative dehydrogenation. However, it may influence other reactions.

4. Stability: The surface vanadia monolayer is stable due to its lower free energy compared to exposed high surface area oxide supports, contributing to catalyst longevity.

5. Reaction conditions: Factors such as temperature and the presence of moisture can affect the structure and reactivity of surface vanadia species.

These characteristics contribute to the industrial significance of supported vanadia catalysts, making them among the most active and selective catalysts for hydrocarbon oxidation reactions. Their unique properties, including higher surface density and generally higher reactivity per site compared to other supported metal oxide catalysts, further enhance their industrial importance.

The literature does not provide specific information about metal-exchanged zeolites or zeolite-catalyzed reactions in the context of alkane transformations.

支持的钒氧化物催化剂的成分、结构和反应条件显著影响烷烃转化的机理和效率，特别是在氧化脱氢过程中。关键因素包括：

1. 载体材料：氧化物载体的选择极大地影响反应的转化频率（TOF），不同载体观察到的变化可达四个数量级。这主要是由于桥接V-O-载体键的影响。

2. 载体的电负性：V-O-载体键中更具电负性或碱性的桥接氧，对应于电负性较低的氧化物载体阳离子，与烃类氧化反应所需的关键氧相关。

3. 表面覆盖度：随着表面钒氧化物覆盖度的增加，桥接V-O-V键的浓度增加，但这并不显著影响某些反应，如丙烷氧化脱氢。然而，它可能影响其他反应。

4. 稳定性：表面钒氧化物单层由于其自由能低于暴露的高比表面积氧化物载体而稳定，有助于催化剂的长寿命。

5. 反应条件：温度和水分等因素可以影响表面钒氧化物物种的结构和反应活性。

这些特性促成了支持的钒氧化物催化剂的工业重要性，使它们成为烃类氧化反应中最活跃和选择性最高的催化剂之一。它们的独特性质，包括与其他支持的金属氧化物催化剂相比具有更高的表面密度和通常更高的每个位点反应活性，进一步增强了它们的工业重要性。
