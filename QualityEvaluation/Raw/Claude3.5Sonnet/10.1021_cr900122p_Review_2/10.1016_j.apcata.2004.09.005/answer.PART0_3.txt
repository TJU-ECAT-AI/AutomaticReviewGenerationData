[1] "Several different compounds, particularly silica supported metal oxides [1,2] were used in the process. Recently it has been mentioned that ZSM-5 [3] and ZSM-5 combined with molybdenum [4,5] or tungsten [6] were investigated. Silica supported V2O5 and MoO3 were used most frequently. They are considered to be the most effective in the production of formaldehyde [7,8]."

[2] "Fe-ZSM-5 was used as a catalyst for the room temperature methane oxidation by N2O [1317]. The activation of methane over Fe-ZSM-5 is believed to be similar to methane activation in MMO thus to employ a redox mechanism."

[3] "The reaction was carried out at the atmospheric pressure at 350650 8C. ZSM-5 molecular sieves with the iron and silicon tetrahedral framework were used as catalysts. The Si/Fe molar ratio was 45, 34 and 22. Fe-ZSM-5 was applied both in the sodium and hydrogen form."

[4] "Higher values of methane conversion were acquired when Fe-HZSM-5 (31.51% for Si/Fe = 22) was used. Fe-NaZSM-5 resulted in procuring higher values of the selectivity of the oxidation of methane to methanol (74% for Si/Fe = 45)."

[5] "It was found that increasing the temperature as well as extending the contact time increases the conversion of methane to methanol and at the same time lowers the value of the selectivity of the oxidation of methane to methanol."

The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations:

1. Catalyst composition: Silica-supported metal oxides like V2O5 and MoO3 are effective for formaldehyde production. ZSM-5 zeolites, especially when combined with metals like molybdenum or tungsten, are also investigated for alkane transformations.

2. Zeolite structure: Fe-ZSM-5 catalysts with varying Si/Fe ratios (45, 34, 22) were studied in both sodium and hydrogen forms. The iron content in the zeolite framework affects catalytic activity and selectivity.

3. Reaction conditions: 
- Temperature: Reactions were carried out at 350-650°C. Higher temperatures increased methane conversion but decreased selectivity to methanol.
- Pressure: Atmospheric pressure was used.
- Contact time: Longer contact times increased methane conversion but decreased selectivity to methanol.

4. Catalyst form: Fe-HZSM-5 showed higher methane conversion (31.51% for Si/Fe = 22), while Fe-NaZSM-5 demonstrated higher selectivity for methane to methanol oxidation (74% for Si/Fe = 45).

5. Reaction mechanism: Fe-ZSM-5 is believed to activate methane through a redox mechanism similar to methane monooxygenase (MMO) in biological systems.

These factors contribute to the industrial significance of metal-based catalysts by allowing control over product distribution and reaction efficiency in alkane transformation processes like oxidative dehydrogenation and zeolite-catalyzed reactions.

金属基催化剂的组成、结构和反应条件显著影响烷烃转化的机理和效率：

1. 催化剂组成：二氧化硅负载的金属氧化物如V2O5和MoO3对甲醛生产非常有效。ZSM-5沸石，特别是与钼或钨等金属结合时，也被研究用于烷烃转化。

2. 沸石结构：研究了不同Si/Fe比率（45、34、22）的Fe-ZSM-5催化剂，包括钠型和氢型。沸石骨架中的铁含量影响催化活性和选择性。

3. 反应条件：
- 温度：反应在350-650°C进行。较高的温度增加了甲烷转化率，但降低了对甲醇的选择性。
- 压力：使用大气压。
- 接触时间：较长的接触时间增加了甲烷转化率，但降低了对甲醇的选择性。

4. 催化剂形式：Fe-HZSM-5显示出较高的甲烷转化率（Si/Fe = 22时为31.51%），而Fe-NaZSM-5展现出较高的甲烷到甲醇氧化选择性（Si/Fe = 45时为74%）。

5. 反应机理：Fe-ZSM-5被认为通过类似于生物系统中甲烷单加氧酶（MMO）的氧化还原机制来活化甲烷。

这些因素通过允许控制烷烃转化过程（如氧化脱氢和沸石催化反应）中的产物分布和反应效率，促进了金属基催化剂的工业重要性。
