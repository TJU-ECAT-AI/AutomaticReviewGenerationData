[1] "Several different compounds, particularly silica supported metal oxides [1,2] were used in the process. Recently it has been mentioned that ZSM-5 [3] and ZSM-5 combined with molybdenum [4,5] or tungsten [6] were investigated. Silica supported V2O5 and MoO3 were used most frequently. They are considered to be the most effective in the production of formaldehyde [7,8]."

[2] "Fe-ZSM-5 was used as a catalyst for the room temperature methane oxidation by N2O [1317]. The activation of methane over Fe-ZSM-5 is believed to be similar to methane activation in MMO thus to employ a redox mechanism."

[3] "The reaction was carried out at the atmospheric pressure at 350650 8C. ZSM-5 molecular sieves with the iron and silicon tetrahedral framework were used as catalysts. The Si/Fe molar ratio was 45, 34 and 22. Fe-ZSM-5 was applied both in the sodium and hydrogen form."

[4] "Higher values of methane conversion were acquired when Fe-HZSM-5 (31.51% for Si/Fe = 22) was used. Fe-NaZSM-5 resulted in procuring higher values of the selectivity of the oxidation of methane to methanol (74% for Si/Fe = 45)."

[5] "It was found that increasing the temperature as well as extending the contact time increases the conversion of methane to methanol and at the same time lowers the value of the selectivity of the oxidation of methane to methanol."

The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations:

Composition: Various metal oxides supported on silica, as well as metal-exchanged zeolites like Fe-ZSM-5, are used as catalysts. The Si/Fe ratio in Fe-ZSM-5 affects catalyst performance, with higher iron content generally increasing methane conversion but decreasing selectivity to methanol.

Structure: ZSM-5 zeolites with iron incorporated into the framework are effective catalysts. The form of the zeolite (sodium or hydrogen) impacts activity and selectivity, with Fe-HZSM-5 showing higher methane conversion and Fe-NaZSM-5 demonstrating higher selectivity to methanol.

Reaction conditions: Temperature and contact time significantly affect the reaction. Higher temperatures and longer contact times increase methane conversion but decrease selectivity to methanol. The reaction is typically carried out at atmospheric pressure and temperatures between 350-650°C.

These factors contribute to industrial significance by allowing control over product distribution and reaction efficiency. For example, silica-supported V2O5 and MoO3 are considered most effective for formaldehyde production, while Fe-ZSM-5 can be tuned for methanol or formaldehyde production depending on conditions. The ability to perform reactions at atmospheric pressure and relatively low temperatures also improves the economic viability of these processes.

金属基催化剂的组成、结构和反应条件对烷烃转化的机理和效率有显著影响：

组成：各种负载在二氧化硅上的金属氧化物以及像Fe-ZSM-5这样的金属交换沸石被用作催化剂。Fe-ZSM-5中的Si/Fe比例影响催化剂性能，较高的铁含量通常会增加甲烷转化率但降低对甲醇的选择性。

结构：将铁掺入骨架的ZSM-5沸石是有效的催化剂。沸石的形态（钠型或氢型）影响活性和选择性，Fe-HZSM-5显示出更高的甲烷转化率，而Fe-NaZSM-5表现出对甲醇更高的选择性。

反应条件：温度和接触时间显著影响反应。更高的温度和更长的接触时间会增加甲烷转化率但降低对甲醇的选择性。反应通常在大气压下，温度在350-650°C之间进行。

这些因素通过允许控制产品分布和反应效率而对工业具有重要意义。例如，负载在二氧化硅上的V2O5和MoO3被认为对甲醛生产最有效，而Fe-ZSM-5可以根据条件调整为甲醇或甲醛生产。在大气压和相对较低温度下进行反应的能力也提高了这些过程的经济可行性。
