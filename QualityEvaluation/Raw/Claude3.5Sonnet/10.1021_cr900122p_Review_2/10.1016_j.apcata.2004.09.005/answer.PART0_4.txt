[1] "Several different compounds, particularly silica supported metal oxides [1,2] were used in the process. Recently it has been mentioned that ZSM-5 [3] and ZSM-5 combined with molybdenum [4,5] or tungsten [6] were investigated. Silica supported V2O5 and MoO3 were used most frequently. They are considered to be the most effective in the production of formaldehyde [7,8]."

[2] "ZSM-5 molecular sieves with the iron and silicon tetrahedral framework were used as catalysts. The Si/Fe molar ratio was 45, 34 and 22. Fe-ZSM-5 was applied both in the sodium and hydrogen form."

[3] "The reaction was carried out at the atmospheric pressure at 350650 8C."

[4] "Increasing the iron content resulted in the rise of methane conversion. The selectivity of the oxidation of methane to oxygenates displayed a slight grow along with the drop of the iron content, while the selectivity of methane oxidation to carbon dioxide was falling."

[5] "Extending the contact time and increasing the temperature resulted in lowering the selectivity of the oxidation of methane to methanol for all the catalysts."

The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations:

1. Catalyst composition: Various metal-based catalysts are used, including silica-supported metal oxides (V2O5, MoO3), metal-exchanged zeolites (Fe-ZSM-5), and ZSM-5 combined with molybdenum or tungsten. The metal content affects catalytic activity and selectivity. For Fe-ZSM-5, increasing iron content leads to higher methane conversion but lower selectivity to oxygenates.

2. Catalyst structure: ZSM-5 molecular sieves with iron and silicon in the framework are used, with varying Si/Fe molar ratios (45, 34, 22). The catalyst can be in sodium or hydrogen form, affecting its performance.

3. Reaction conditions: The process is typically carried out at atmospheric pressure and temperatures between 350-650°C. Increasing temperature and contact time generally increases methane conversion but decreases selectivity to methanol.

These factors contribute to industrial significance by allowing control over product distribution and reaction efficiency. For example, silica-supported V2O5 and MoO3 are considered most effective for formaldehyde production, while Fe-ZSM-5 can be tuned for methanol or formaldehyde production by adjusting iron content and reaction conditions.

金属基催化剂的组成、结构和反应条件显著影响烷烃转化的机理和效率：

1. 催化剂组成：使用多种金属基催化剂，包括硅胶负载的金属氧化物（V2O5、MoO3）、金属交换的沸石（Fe-ZSM-5），以及与钼或钨结合的ZSM-5。金属含量影响催化活性和选择性。对于Fe-ZSM-5，增加铁含量导致甲烷转化率提高，但含氧化合物的选择性降低。

2. 催化剂结构：使用具有铁和硅骨架的ZSM-5分子筛，Si/Fe摩尔比不同（45、34、22）。催化剂可以是钠型或氢型，影响其性能。

3. 反应条件：该过程通常在常压下、350-650°C的温度范围内进行。提高温度和接触时间通常会增加甲烷转化率，但降低甲醇的选择性。

这些因素通过允许控制产品分布和反应效率来影响工业重要性。例如，硅胶负载的V2O5和MoO3被认为是生产甲醛最有效的催化剂，而Fe-ZSM-5可以通过调整铁含量和反应条件来调节甲醇或甲醛的生产。
