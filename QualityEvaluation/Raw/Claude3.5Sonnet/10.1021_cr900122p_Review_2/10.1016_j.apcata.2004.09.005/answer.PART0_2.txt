[1] "Several different compounds, particularly silica supported metal oxides [1,2] were used in the process. Recently it has been mentioned that ZSM-5 [3] and ZSM-5 combined with molybdenum [4,5] or tungsten [6] were investigated. Silica supported V2O5 and MoO3 were used most frequently. They are considered to be the most effective in the production of formaldehyde [7,8]."

[2] "Fe-ZSM-5 was used as a catalyst for the room temperature methane oxidation by N2O [1317]. The activation of methane over Fe-ZSM-5 is believed to be similar to methane activation in MMO thus to employ a redox mechanism."

[3] "My research regarded oxidation of methane by oxygen under the atmospheric pressure conditions. ZSM-5 molecular sieves with the iron and silicon framework only were employed as the process catalysts."

[4] "Increasing the iron content resulted in the rise of methane conversion. The selectivity of the oxidation of methane to oxygenates displayed a slight grow along with the drop of the iron content, while the selectivity of methane oxidation to carbon dioxide was falling."

[5] "The increase of the temperature results in the rise of methane conversion. The methane conversion values for the molecular sieves in the hydrogen form exceed the ones in the sodium one, displaying the same iron content."

The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations. For oxidative dehydrogenation, silica-supported metal oxides like V2O5 and MoO3 are most effective for formaldehyde production. Metal-exchanged zeolites, particularly Fe-ZSM-5, are used for methane oxidation.

The iron content in Fe-ZSM-5 catalysts affects methane conversion and product selectivity. Higher iron content increases methane conversion but decreases selectivity to oxygenates while increasing selectivity to carbon dioxide. The catalyst form (hydrogen or sodium) also impacts performance, with the hydrogen form showing higher methane conversion.

Reaction conditions like temperature and contact time influence conversion and selectivity. Higher temperatures increase methane conversion but decrease selectivity to methanol. The redox mechanism is believed to be similar to methane monooxygenase in biological systems.

These catalysts are industrially significant due to their ability to directly convert methane to value-added products like methanol and formaldehyde under relatively mild conditions (atmospheric pressure, 350-650°C), potentially offering a more economical route than traditional methane steam reforming.

金属基催化剂的组成、结构和反应条件显著影响烷烃转化的机理和效率。对于氧化脱氢反应，二氧化硅负载的金属氧化物如V2O5和MoO3对甲醛生产最为有效。金属交换的沸石，尤其是Fe-ZSM-5，用于甲烷氧化。

Fe-ZSM-5催化剂中的铁含量影响甲烷转化率和产品选择性。较高的铁含量增加甲烷转化率，但降低了含氧化合物的选择性，同时增加了二氧化碳的选择性。催化剂的形式（氢形或钠形）也影响性能，氢形表现出更高的甲烷转化率。

反应条件如温度和接触时间影响转化率和选择性。较高的温度增加甲烷转化率，但降低甲醇的选择性。其氧化还原机理被认为类似于生物系统中的甲烷单加氧酶。

这些催化剂具有工业重要性，因为它们能够在相对温和的条件下（大气压力，350-650°C）直接将甲烷转化为甲醇和甲醛等高附加值产品，可能提供比传统甲烷蒸汽重整更经济的路线。
