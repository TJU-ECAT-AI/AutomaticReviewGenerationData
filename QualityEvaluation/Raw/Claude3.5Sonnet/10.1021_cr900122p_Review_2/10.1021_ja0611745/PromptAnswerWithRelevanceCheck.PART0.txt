[1] "Supported vanadium oxides are one of the best catalysts for the ODH of propane with high thermal stability and the large surface area."

[2] "Generally, the activity and selectivity of the catalyst depends on its reducibility and basicity."

[3] "To achieve high activity and selectivity the presence of highly dispersed vanadium is crucial."

[4] "For a good catalyst, there is a compromise between the activity in CH bond activation and the easiness to release the propene molecule from the surface."

[5] "From our study, for example, the reducibility of the O(2) site is indeed much facilitated by other surface atoms, which is a rather long-range effect."

[6] "In supported catalysts, multiple lattice O species are available, including VO, VOV, and VOM sites (M is the metal cation from oxide supports). This introduces much flexibility in controlling the catalyst activity as the electronic structures of the two-coordinated O and the terminal VO in these systems can be very different from the V2O5 bulk."

The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations, particularly in oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) processes. For supported vanadium oxide catalysts:

1. Composition: The presence of highly dispersed vanadium is crucial for achieving high activity and selectivity. The support material also plays a role, as it can affect the electronic structure of the active sites.

2. Structure: The catalyst's reducibility and basicity are key factors determining its activity and selectivity. The availability of different oxygen species (VO, VOV, VOM) in supported catalysts provides flexibility in controlling catalyst activity.

3. Reaction conditions: While not explicitly mentioned in the given quotes, reaction conditions such as temperature and gas composition typically affect the catalyst's performance.

The efficiency of alkane transformations is influenced by a balance between CH bond activation and product release. A good catalyst must strike a compromise between these two factors.

Industrial significance of these catalysts stems from their high thermal stability, large surface area, and ability to perform oxidative dehydrogenation of propane efficiently. The flexibility in controlling catalyst activity through support modification and vanadium dispersion allows for optimization of industrial processes.

The study also highlights the importance of long-range effects in catalyst activity, particularly the facilitation of O(2) site reducibility by other surface atoms. This insight could guide the development of more efficient industrial catalysts.

While the given text does not provide information about zeolite-catalyzed reactions, the principles of balancing activity and selectivity likely apply to those systems as well.

The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts, particularly supported vanadium oxides, significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations in oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) processes.

Composition: Supported vanadium oxides are highly effective catalysts for propane ODH due to their high thermal stability and large surface area. The presence of highly dispersed vanadium is crucial for achieving high activity and selectivity.

Structure: At low loadings, vanadium is molecularly dispersed, while at higher loadings, V2O5 crystallites form. The structure of the catalyst affects its reducibility and basicity, which in turn influence its activity and selectivity.

Reaction conditions: The efficiency of the catalyst depends on a balance between its ability to activate C-H bonds and its ability to release propene. The reducibility of oxygen sites, such as O(2), is facilitated by other surface atoms, demonstrating a long-range effect.

In supported catalysts, multiple lattice oxygen species (VO, VOV, and VOM) are available, providing flexibility in controlling catalyst activity. The electronic structures of these oxygen species can differ significantly from those in bulk V2O5, contributing to their industrial significance.

The industrial importance of these catalysts stems from their ability to be fine-tuned through variations in composition, structure, and reaction conditions. This allows for optimization of the catalytic process, balancing activity and selectivity to achieve desired product yields while minimizing unwanted side reactions.

金属基催化剂，特别是负载型钒氧化物的组成、结构和反应条件显著影响烷烃转化的机理和效率，尤其是在氧化脱氢（ODH）过程中。

组成：负载型钒氧化物是丙烷ODH的高效催化剂，因为它们具有高热稳定性和大比表面积。高度分散的钒的存在对于实现高活性和选择性至关重要。

结构：在低负载量时，钒呈分子分散状态，而在高负载量时，会形成V2O5晶体。催化剂的结构影响其还原性和碱性，进而影响其活性和选择性。

反应条件：催化剂的效率取决于其活化C-H键的能力和释放丙烯的能力之间的平衡。氧位点（如O(2)）的还原性受其他表面原子的影响，显示出长程效应。

在负载型催化剂中，存在多种晶格氧物种（VO、VOV和VOM），这为控制催化剂活性提供了灵活性。这些氧物种的电子结构可能与体相V2O5中的显著不同，这也是它们具有工业重要性的原因之一。

这些催化剂的工业重要性源于它们可以通过改变组成、结构和反应条件进行精细调节。这允许优化催化过程，平衡活性和选择性，以达到理想的产品产率，同时最小化不需要的副反应。

The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts, particularly supported vanadium oxides, significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations in processes like oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH).

Supported vanadium oxides are highly effective catalysts for propane ODH due to their high thermal stability and large surface area. The activity and selectivity of these catalysts depend on their reducibility and basicity. Achieving high activity and selectivity requires highly dispersed vanadium.

The efficiency of these catalysts is determined by a balance between their ability to activate C-H bonds and their ability to release the desired product (e.g., propene) from the surface. This balance is crucial for preventing unwanted side reactions and improving selectivity.

The structure of supported catalysts plays a significant role in their performance. The reducibility of certain oxygen sites (e.g., O(2)) is enhanced by long-range effects from other surface atoms. In supported catalysts, multiple types of lattice oxygen species are available (VO, VOV, VOM), which provides flexibility in controlling catalyst activity.

While the literature doesn't specifically discuss zeolite-catalyzed reactions, the principles of balancing activity and selectivity likely apply to metal-exchanged zeolites as well. The industrial significance of these catalysts stems from their ability to efficiently transform alkanes into more valuable products, such as olefins, under controlled conditions.

[6] "For the ODH reaction, the high activities in activating CH bond and in producing propene are two properties acting negatively to each other. It is expected that the activity of the oxide-supported vanadium can be tuned by controlling the polymerization extent and the support materials."

For supported vanadium oxide catalysts:

1. Composition: The presence of highly dispersed vanadium is crucial for high activity and selectivity. The reducibility and basicity of the catalyst affect its performance.

2. Structure: At low loadings, vanadium is molecularly dispersed, while at higher loadings, V2O5 crystallites form. The vanadyl oxygen (O(1)) is more reactive in C-H bond activation, but the bridging oxygen (O(2)) facilitates easier propene formation.

3. Reaction conditions: High thermal stability is important for ODH reactions.

4. Efficiency factors: There's a trade-off between C-H bond activation activity and propene production ability. The catalyst's activity can be tuned by controlling vanadium polymerization extent and choice of support materials.

5. Industrial significance: Supported vanadium oxides are considered among the best catalysts for propane ODH due to their high thermal stability and large surface area.

The study does not provide information on metal-exchanged zeolites or zeolite-catalyzed reactions. However, the findings on vanadium oxide catalysts suggest that similar principles of balancing active sites, support interactions, and reaction conditions likely apply to other metal-based catalysts in alkane transformations.
