[1] "Supported vanadium oxides are one of the best catalysts for the ODH of propane with high thermal stability and the large surface area."

[2] "Generally, the activity and selectivity of the catalyst depends on its reducibility and basicity."

[3] "To achieve high activity and selectivity the presence of highly dispersed vanadium is crucial."

[4] "For a good catalyst, there is a compromise between the activity in CH bond activation and the easiness to release the propene molecule from the surface."

[5] "From our study, for example, the reducibility of the O(2) site is indeed much facilitated by other surface atoms, which is a rather long-range effect."

[6] "In supported catalysts, multiple lattice O species are available, including VO, VOV, and VOM sites (M is the metal cation from oxide supports). This introduces much flexibility in controlling the catalyst activity as the electronic structures of the two-coordinated O and the terminal VO in these systems can be very different from the V2O5 bulk."

The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations, particularly in oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) processes. For supported vanadium oxide catalysts:

1. Composition: The presence of highly dispersed vanadium is crucial for achieving high activity and selectivity. The support material also plays a role, as it can affect the electronic structure of the active sites.

2. Structure: The catalyst's reducibility and basicity are key factors determining its activity and selectivity. The availability of different oxygen species (VO, VOV, VOM) in supported catalysts provides flexibility in controlling catalyst activity.

3. Reaction conditions: While not explicitly mentioned in the given quotes, reaction conditions such as temperature and gas composition typically affect the catalyst's performance.

The efficiency of alkane transformations is influenced by a balance between CH bond activation and product release. A good catalyst must strike a compromise between these two factors.

Industrial significance of these catalysts stems from their high thermal stability, large surface area, and ability to perform oxidative dehydrogenation of propane efficiently. The flexibility in controlling catalyst activity through support modification and vanadium dispersion allows for optimization of industrial processes.

The study also highlights the importance of long-range effects in catalyst activity, particularly the facilitation of O(2) site reducibility by other surface atoms. This insight could guide the development of more efficient industrial catalysts.

While the given text does not provide information about zeolite-catalyzed reactions, the principles of balancing activity and selectivity likely apply to those systems as well.

金属基催化剂的组成、结构和反应条件显著影响烷烃转化的机理和效率，特别是在氧化脱氢(ODH)过程中。对于负载型钒氧化物催化剂：

1. 组成：高度分散的钒的存在对于实现高活性和选择性至关重要。载体材料也起着重要作用，因为它可以影响活性位点的电子结构。

2. 结构：催化剂的可还原性和碱性是决定其活性和选择性的关键因素。在负载型催化剂中，不同氧物种（VO、VOV、VOM）的可用性提供了控制催化剂活性的灵活性。

3. 反应条件：虽然在给定的引用中没有明确提到，但温度和气体组成等反应条件通常会影响催化剂的性能。

烷烃转化的效率受到CH键活化和产物释放之间平衡的影响。一个好的催化剂必须在这两个因素之间取得折衷。

这些催化剂的工业重要性源于它们的高热稳定性、大比表面积以及高效进行丙烷氧化脱氢的能力。通过载体改性和钒分散度来控制催化剂活性的灵活性允许优化工业过程。

该研究还强调了催化剂活性中长程效应的重要性，特别是其他表面原子对O(2)位点可还原性的促进作用。这一见解可以指导更高效的工业催化剂的开发。

虽然给定的文本没有提供关于沸石催化反应的信息，但平衡活性和选择性的原则可能也适用于这些系统。
