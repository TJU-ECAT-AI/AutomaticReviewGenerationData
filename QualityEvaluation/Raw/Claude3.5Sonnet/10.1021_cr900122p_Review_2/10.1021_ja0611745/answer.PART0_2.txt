[1] "Supported vanadium oxides are one of the best catalysts for the ODH of propane with high thermal stability and the large surface area."

[2] "Generally, the activity and selectivity of the catalyst depends on its reducibility and basicity."

[3] "To achieve high activity and selectivity the presence of highly dispersed vanadium is crucial."

[4] "For a good catalyst, there is a compromise between the activity in CH bond activation and the easiness to release the propene molecule from the surface."

[5] "From our study, for example, the reducibility of the O(2) site is indeed much facilitated by other surface atoms, which is a rather long-range effect. In supported catalysts, multiple lattice O species are available, including VO, VOV, and VOM sites (M is the metal cation from oxide supports)."

The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts, particularly supported vanadium oxides, significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations in processes like oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH).

Supported vanadium oxides are highly effective catalysts for propane ODH due to their high thermal stability and large surface area. The activity and selectivity of these catalysts depend on their reducibility and basicity. Achieving high activity and selectivity requires highly dispersed vanadium.

The efficiency of these catalysts is determined by a balance between their ability to activate C-H bonds and their ability to release the desired product (e.g., propene) from the surface. This balance is crucial for preventing unwanted side reactions and improving selectivity.

The structure of supported catalysts plays a significant role in their performance. The reducibility of certain oxygen sites (e.g., O(2)) is enhanced by long-range effects from other surface atoms. In supported catalysts, multiple types of lattice oxygen species are available (VO, VOV, VOM), which provides flexibility in controlling catalyst activity.

While the literature doesn't specifically discuss zeolite-catalyzed reactions, the principles of balancing activity and selectivity likely apply to metal-exchanged zeolites as well. The industrial significance of these catalysts stems from their ability to efficiently transform alkanes into more valuable products, such as olefins, under controlled conditions.

金属基催化剂的组成、结构和反应条件，特别是负载型钒氧化物，显著影响烷烃转化过程中的机理和效率，尤其是在氧化脱氢(ODH)等过程中。

负载型钒氧化物是丙烷ODH的高效催化剂，这归因于它们的高热稳定性和大比表面积。这些催化剂的活性和选择性取决于它们的可还原性和碱性。要达到高活性和高选择性，需要高度分散的钒。

这些催化剂的效率取决于它们活化C-H键的能力与从表面释放所需产物（如丙烯）的能力之间的平衡。这种平衡对于防止不需要的副反应和提高选择性至关重要。

负载型催化剂的结构对其性能起着重要作用。某些氧位点（如O(2)）的可还原性受到其他表面原子的长程效应增强。在负载型催化剂中，存在多种类型的晶格氧物种（VO、VOV、VOM），这为控制催化剂活性提供了灵活性。

虽然文献没有具体讨论沸石催化反应，但活性和选择性平衡的原则可能也适用于金属交换的沸石。这些催化剂的工业重要性源于它们能够在受控条件下高效地将烷烃转化为更有价值的产品，如烯烃。
