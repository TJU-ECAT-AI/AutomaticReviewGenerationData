[1] "Supported vanadium oxides are one of the best catalysts for the ODH of propane with high thermal stability and the large surface area."

[2] "Generally, the activity and selectivity of the catalyst depends on its reducibility and basicity."

[3] "To achieve high activity and selectivity the presence of highly dispersed vanadium is crucial."

[4] "For a good catalyst, there is a compromise between the activity in CH bond activation and the easiness to release the propene molecule from the surface."

[5] "From our study, for example, the reducibility of the O(2) site is indeed much facilitated by other surface atoms, which is a rather long-range effect."

[6] "In supported catalysts, multiple lattice O species are available, including VO, VOV, and VOM sites (M is the metal cation from oxide supports). This introduces much flexibility in controlling the catalyst activity as the electronic structures of the two-coordinated O and the terminal VO in these systems can be very different from the V2O5 bulk."

The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations, particularly in oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) processes. For supported vanadium oxide catalysts:

1. Composition: The presence of highly dispersed vanadium is crucial for achieving high activity and selectivity. The support material also plays a role, as it can affect the electronic structure of the active sites.

2. Structure: The catalyst's reducibility and basicity are key factors determining its activity and selectivity. The availability of different oxygen species (VO, VOV, VOM) in supported catalysts provides flexibility in controlling catalyst activity.

3. Reaction conditions: High thermal stability is important for the ODH of propane.

The efficiency of these catalysts is influenced by a balance between CH bond activation ability and ease of product (e.g., propene) release from the surface. The reducibility of oxygen sites, facilitated by long-range effects from other surface atoms, is also crucial.

These factors contribute to the industrial significance of supported vanadium oxide catalysts by allowing for tunable activity and selectivity in alkane transformation processes. The ability to control the polymerization extent of vanadium and modify support materials provides opportunities for optimizing catalyst performance for specific industrial applications.

While the literature does not specifically discuss zeolite-catalyzed reactions, the principles of balancing active site properties and understanding long-range structural effects likely apply to metal-exchanged zeolites as well, though the specific mechanisms may differ.

金属基催化剂的组成、结构和反应条件显著影响烷烃转化的机理和效率，特别是在氧化脱氢(ODH)过程中。对于负载型钒氧化物催化剂：

1. 组成：高度分散的钒的存在对于实现高活性和选择性至关重要。载体材料也起着重要作用，因为它可以影响活性位点的电子结构。

2. 结构：催化剂的可还原性和碱性是决定其活性和选择性的关键因素。负载型催化剂中不同氧物种(VO、VOV、VOM)的可用性为控制催化剂活性提供了灵活性。

3. 反应条件：高热稳定性对丙烷的ODH反应很重要。

这些催化剂的效率受CH键活化能力和产物（如丙烯）从表面释放容易程度之间的平衡影响。氧位点的可还原性，由其他表面原子的长程效应促进，也是至关重要的。

这些因素通过允许在烷烃转化过程中实现可调的活性和选择性，促进了负载型钒氧化物催化剂的工业重要性。控制钒的聚合程度和修改载体材料的能力为特定工业应用优化催化剂性能提供了机会。

虽然文献没有具体讨论沸石催化反应，但平衡活性位点性质和理解长程结构效应的原则可能也适用于金属交换沸石，尽管具体机制可能有所不同。
