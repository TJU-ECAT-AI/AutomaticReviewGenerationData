[1] "We examine possible reaction mechanisms for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane by supported transition metal oxide catalysts. Specifically we are interested in V2O5 supported on SiO22,12,13 and consider monomeric OV(O)3 surface species, which together with dimeric and oligomeric V2O5 species are present on catalyst surfaces with low V2O5 loadings."

[2] "Hydrogen abstraction by the vanadyl oxygen atom is the initial step in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane by supported vanadium oxide species. The diradical intermediate that is reached via the diradicaloid transition structure Ts1 consists of a propyl radical attached to a HOV(O)3 site and has similar energies in the singlet and triplet states (Int2)."

[3] "Desorption of propyl radicals leads to a stationary concentration of propyl in the gas phase and leaves reduced HOVIV sites (Int12) on the surface. Due to fast reoxidation their concentration is much smaller than the concentration of OVV sites (Int0)."

[4] "For V2O5/SiO2 catalysts with vanadium surface coverages below 3 V/nm2 (i.e., below the limit at which V2O5 crystallites start to appear) turnover frequencies (TOF) of around 0.01 s-1 (748 K) 37 and 0.3 × 10-3 s-1 (623 K) 38 have been observed for propene formation."

[5] "Comparison with recent DFT calculations for V2O5(001) crystal surfaces9 indicates that vanadia sites may be significantly more active in the ODH of propane if they are part of the bulk surface and not supported as monomers on silica. However, apparent turnover frequencies may be lower for V2O5 crystallites on the surface because only a fraction of sites is accessible in three-dimensional particles."

The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of supported vanadium oxide catalysts significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations, particularly in oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) processes. 

For V2O5 supported on SiO2, the catalyst's composition and structure are crucial. At low V2O5 loadings, monomeric OV(O)3 surface species are present along with dimeric and oligomeric V2O5 species. The vanadium surface coverage affects the catalyst's performance, with optimal activity observed below 3 V/nm2, before V2O5 crystallites start to form.

The reaction mechanism involves hydrogen abstraction by the vanadyl oxygen atom as the initial step. This forms a diradical intermediate consisting of a propyl radical attached to a HOV(O)3 site. The reaction proceeds through several steps involving desorption and readsorption of propyl radicals, with the concentration of reduced HOVIV sites being much smaller than that of OVV sites due to fast reoxidation.

Reaction conditions, particularly temperature, greatly influence the efficiency of the process. For V2O5/SiO2 catalysts, turnover frequencies (TOF) of around 0.01 s-1 at 748 K and 0.3 × 10-3 s-1 at 623 K have been observed for propene formation, demonstrating the significant impact of temperature on catalyst performance.

The structure of the vanadium oxide species also plays a crucial role. DFT calculations suggest that vanadia sites may be more active in propane ODH if they are part of the bulk surface rather than supported as monomers on silica. However, V2O5 crystallites on the surface may show lower apparent turnover frequencies due to limited accessibility of active sites in three-dimensional particles.

These factors contribute to the industrial significance of supported vanadium oxide catalysts in alkane transformation processes. The ability to fine-tune catalyst composition, structure, and reaction conditions allows for optimization of catalyst performance, making these systems valuable for industrial applications in the production of valuable chemical intermediates from alkanes.

负载型钒氧化物催化剂的组成、结构和反应条件显著影响烷烃转化的机理和效率，特别是在氧化脱氢(ODH)过程中。

对于负载在SiO2上的V2O5，催化剂的组成和结构至关重要。在低V2O5负载量时，单体OV(O)3表面物种与二聚体和寡聚体V2O5物种共存。钒的表面覆盖度影响催化剂的性能，最佳活性观察到在3 V/nm2以下，即V2O5晶体开始形成之前。

反应机理涉及钒基氧原子对氢的抽提作为初始步骤。这形成了由丙基自由基附着在HOV(O)3位点上的双自由基中间体。反应通过丙基自由基的脱附和再吸附等几个步骤进行，由于快速再氧化，还原态HOVIV位点的浓度远低于OVV位点的浓度。

反应条件，特别是温度，极大地影响了过程的效率。对于V2O5/SiO2催化剂，在748 K时丙烯生成的转化频率(TOF)约为0.01 s-1，在623 K时为0.3 × 10-3 s-1，这表明温度对催化剂性能有显著影响。

钒氧化物物种的结构也起着关键作用。DFT计算表明，如果钒位点是体相表面的一部分，而不是作为单体负载在二氧化硅上，它们在丙烷ODH中可能更活跃。然而，表面上的V2O5晶体可能由于三维颗粒中活性位点的可及性有限而表现出较低的表观转化频率。

这些因素促进了负载型钒氧化物催化剂在烷烃转化过程中的工业重要性。能够精细调节催化剂组成、结构和反应条件，使得催化剂性能得以优化，使这些系统在从烷烃生产有价值的化学中间体的工业应用中具有重要价值。

[1] "The first step is adsorption of propane onto the surface site leading to the van der Waals complex Int1."

[2] "From Int1, two reaction routes can be followed, namely hydrogen abstraction by the oxygen atom of the vanadyl group through Ts1 or by one of the three bridging VOSi oxygen atoms through Ts2."

[3] "Because Ts2 is 60 kJ/mol above Ts1 only the vanadyl group will be involved in the initial activation of propane."

[4] "Vanadium is in a VIII(d2) triplet state in all the intermediates and products reached after the transition structures from Int2 and Int3."

[5] "For V2O5/SiO2 catalysts with vanadium surface coverages below 3 V/nm2 (i.e., below the limit at which V2O5 crystallites start to appear) turnover frequencies (TOF) of around 0.01 s-1 (748 K) 37 and 0.3 × 10-3 s-1 (623 K) 38 have been observed for propene formation."

The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts, particularly supported vanadium oxides, significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations in oxidative dehydrogenation processes. 

For supported vanadium oxide catalysts, the initial step involves propane adsorption onto the surface site, forming a van der Waals complex. The reaction then proceeds through hydrogen abstraction, primarily by the oxygen atom of the vanadyl group, as this pathway has a lower energy barrier compared to abstraction by bridging VOSi oxygen atoms.

The oxidation state of vanadium plays a crucial role in the reaction mechanism. After the initial transition structures, vanadium is in a VIII(d2) triplet state in all intermediates and products, indicating a change in electronic configuration during the reaction.

The efficiency of these catalysts is influenced by the surface coverage of vanadium. For V2O5/SiO2 catalysts with vanadium surface coverages below 3 V/nm2, specific turnover frequencies have been observed at different temperatures, demonstrating the impact of both composition and reaction conditions on catalyst performance.

These factors contribute to the industrial significance of supported vanadium oxide catalysts by determining their activity, selectivity, and overall efficiency in alkane transformation processes. The ability to control and optimize these parameters allows for the development of more effective catalysts for industrial applications.

金属基催化剂的组成、结构和反应条件，特别是负载的钒氧化物，显著影响烷烃转化过程中的机理和效率，尤其是在氧化脱氢过程中。

对于负载型钒氧化物催化剂，初始步骤涉及丙烷在表面位点上的吸附，形成范德华复合物。然后，反应主要通过钒酰基团的氧原子进行氢抽提，因为这条路径比通过桥接VOSi氧原子抽提的能量障碍更低。

钒的氧化态在反应机理中起着关键作用。在初始过渡结构之后，所有中间体和产物中的钒都处于VIII(d2)三重态，表明在反应过程中电子构型发生了变化。

这些催化剂的效率受钒表面覆盖度的影响。对于钒表面覆盖度低于3 V/nm2的V2O5/SiO2催化剂，在不同温度下观察到特定的转化频率，证明了组成和反应条件对催化剂性能的影响。

这些因素通过决定催化剂在烷烃转化过程中的活性、选择性和整体效率，对负载型钒氧化物催化剂的工业重要性做出贡献。控制和优化这些参数的能力使得开发更有效的工业应用催化剂成为可能。
