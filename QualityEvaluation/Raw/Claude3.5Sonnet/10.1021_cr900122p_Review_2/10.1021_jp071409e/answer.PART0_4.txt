[1] "We investigate possible mechanisms of oxidative dehydrogenation of propane using density functional theory. Monomeric vanadium oxide species supported on silica are modeled by vanadyl-substituted silsesquioxane."

[2] "The initial CH bond activation step is hydrogen abstraction by the vanadyl (OVV) group yielding a diradical intermediate in which a propyl radical is bound to a HOVIV site."

[3] "We predict that at 750 K the apparent activation energy is 123  5 kJ/mol and the rate constant is about 0.26 s-1, in close agreement with experiments."

[4] "The first hydrogen abstraction occurs exclusively on OVV sites, while the second hydrogen abstraction can also occur on VOSi bridging oxygen sites."

[5] "Desorption of propyl radicals leads to a stationary concentration of propyl in the gas phase and leaves reduced HOVIV sites on the surface. Due to fast reoxidation their concentration is much smaller than the concentration of OVV sites."

The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of supported vanadium oxide catalysts significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane oxidative dehydrogenation:

1. Composition: The active sites are monomeric vanadium oxide species supported on silica.

2. Structure: The key structural feature is the vanadyl (OVV) group, which is responsible for the initial C-H bond activation.

3. Reaction mechanism: 
   - Initial step: Hydrogen abstraction by the vanadyl group, forming a diradical intermediate.
   - Second step: Can occur on both OVV sites and VOSi bridging oxygen sites.

4. Reaction conditions:
   - Temperature: At 750 K, the apparent activation energy is 123 ± 5 kJ/mol.
   - Surface species: A dynamic equilibrium exists between OVV sites and reduced HOVIV sites.

5. Efficiency factors:
   - Rate-determining step: Formation of propyl radicals by the first hydrogen abstraction.
   - Fast reoxidation of reduced sites maintains a high concentration of active OVV sites.

These factors contribute to the industrial significance of supported vanadium oxide catalysts by providing a well-defined active site structure, allowing for efficient C-H bond activation, and maintaining catalyst activity through rapid reoxidation of reduced sites.
