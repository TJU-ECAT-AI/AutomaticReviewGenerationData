[1] "We investigate possible mechanisms of oxidative dehydrogenation of propane using density functional theory. Monomeric vanadium oxide species supported on silica are modeled by vanadyl-substituted silsesquioxane."

[2] "The initial CH bond activation step is hydrogen abstraction by the vanadyl (OVV) group yielding a diradical intermediate in which a propyl radical is bound to a HOVIV site."

[3] "Generation of surface propyl radicals by the first hydrogen abstraction becomes rate limiting. We predict that at 750 K the apparent activation energy is 123  5 kJ/mol and the rate constant is about 0.26 s-1, in close agreement with experiments."

[4] "The first step is adsorption of propane onto the surface site leading to the van der Waals complex Int1."

[5] "Desorption of propyl radicals leads to a stationary concentration of propyl in the gas phase and leaves reduced HOVIV sites (Int12) on the surface. Due to fast reoxidation their concentration is much smaller than the concentration of OVV sites (Int0)."

The study investigates the mechanisms and efficiency of oxidative dehydrogenation of propane using supported vanadium oxide catalysts. Key factors influencing the reaction include:

1. Catalyst composition: Monomeric vanadium oxide species supported on silica are used.

2. Structure: The active sites are modeled as vanadyl-substituted silsesquioxane, with vanadyl (OVV) groups playing a crucial role.

3. Reaction mechanism: The process involves initial hydrogen abstraction by the vanadyl group, forming a diradical intermediate. This is followed by further steps leading to propene formation.

4. Rate-limiting step: The generation of surface propyl radicals through the first hydrogen abstraction is identified as rate-limiting.

5. Reaction conditions: Temperature significantly affects the reaction kinetics. At 750 K, the apparent activation energy is predicted to be 123 ± 5 kJ/mol, with a rate constant of about 0.26 s-1.

6. Surface dynamics: The process involves adsorption of propane, formation of intermediates, desorption of propyl radicals, and reoxidation of reduced sites.

These factors contribute to the industrial significance of the process by enabling efficient conversion of propane to propene under controlled conditions. The close agreement between theoretical predictions and experimental results underscores the relevance of this mechanistic understanding for practical applications.
