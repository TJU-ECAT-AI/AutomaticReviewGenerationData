[1] "The first step is adsorption of propane onto the surface site leading to the van der Waals complex Int1."

[2] "From Int1, two reaction routes can be followed, namely hydrogen abstraction by the oxygen atom of the vanadyl group through Ts1 or by one of the three bridging VOSi oxygen atoms through Ts2."

[3] "Because Ts2 is 60 kJ/mol above Ts1 only the vanadyl group will be involved in the initial activation of propane."

[4] "Vanadium is in a VIII(d2) triplet state in all the intermediates and products reached after the transition structures from Int2 and Int3."

[5] "For V2O5/SiO2 catalysts with vanadium surface coverages below 3 V/nm2 (i.e., below the limit at which V2O5 crystallites start to appear) turnover frequencies (TOF) of around 0.01 s-1 (748 K) 37 and 0.3 × 10-3 s-1 (623 K) 38 have been observed for propene formation."

The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts, particularly supported vanadium oxides, significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations in oxidative dehydrogenation processes. 

For supported vanadium oxide catalysts, the initial step involves propane adsorption onto the surface site, forming a van der Waals complex. The reaction then proceeds through hydrogen abstraction, primarily by the oxygen atom of the vanadyl group, as this pathway has a lower energy barrier compared to abstraction by bridging VOSi oxygen atoms.

The oxidation state of vanadium plays a crucial role in the reaction mechanism. After the initial transition structures, vanadium is in a VIII(d2) triplet state in all intermediates and products, indicating a change in electronic configuration during the reaction.

The efficiency of these catalysts is influenced by the surface coverage of vanadium. For V2O5/SiO2 catalysts with vanadium surface coverages below 3 V/nm2, specific turnover frequencies have been observed at different temperatures, demonstrating the impact of both composition and reaction conditions on catalyst performance.

These factors contribute to the industrial significance of supported vanadium oxide catalysts by determining their activity, selectivity, and overall efficiency in alkane transformation processes. The ability to control and optimize these parameters allows for the development of more effective catalysts for industrial applications.

金属基催化剂的组成、结构和反应条件，特别是负载的钒氧化物，显著影响烷烃转化过程中的机理和效率，尤其是在氧化脱氢过程中。

对于负载型钒氧化物催化剂，初始步骤涉及丙烷在表面位点上的吸附，形成范德华复合物。然后，反应主要通过钒酰基团的氧原子进行氢抽提，因为这条路径比通过桥接VOSi氧原子抽提的能量障碍更低。

钒的氧化态在反应机理中起着关键作用。在初始过渡结构之后，所有中间体和产物中的钒都处于VIII(d2)三重态，表明在反应过程中电子构型发生了变化。

这些催化剂的效率受钒表面覆盖度的影响。对于钒表面覆盖度低于3 V/nm2的V2O5/SiO2催化剂，在不同温度下观察到特定的转化频率，证明了组成和反应条件对催化剂性能的影响。

这些因素通过决定催化剂在烷烃转化过程中的活性、选择性和整体效率，对负载型钒氧化物催化剂的工业重要性做出贡献。控制和优化这些参数的能力使得开发更有效的工业应用催化剂成为可能。
