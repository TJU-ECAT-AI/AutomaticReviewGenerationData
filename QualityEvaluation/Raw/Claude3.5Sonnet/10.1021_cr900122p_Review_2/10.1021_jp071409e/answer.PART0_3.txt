The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts, particularly supported vanadium oxides, significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations in oxidative dehydrogenation processes.

For supported vanadium oxide catalysts, the initial step in propane oxidative dehydrogenation involves hydrogen abstraction by the vanadyl oxygen atom, forming a diradical intermediate. The catalyst's structure, specifically monomeric vanadium oxide species on silica, plays a crucial role in this mechanism.

The vanadium surface coverage impacts the catalyst's activity. For V2O5/SiO2 catalysts with coverages below 3 V/nm2, specific turnover frequencies have been observed at different temperatures, indicating the influence of both structure and reaction conditions on efficiency.

The reaction mechanism involves the desorption of propyl radicals, leading to a stationary concentration in the gas phase and reduced surface sites. Fast reoxidation maintains a low concentration of reduced sites compared to oxidized sites, affecting the overall reaction kinetics.

Comparisons with DFT calculations suggest that vanadia sites may be more active in propane ODH when part of a bulk surface rather than supported as monomers on silica. This indicates that the support material and the structural arrangement of the active sites significantly influence catalytic activity.

These factors contribute to the industrial significance of these catalysts by determining their activity, selectivity, and overall efficiency in alkane transformation processes. Understanding these relationships allows for the design and optimization of catalysts for specific industrial applications.

金属基催化剂的组成、结构和反应条件，特别是负载型钒氧化物，显著影响烷烃转化在氧化脱氢过程中的机理和效率。

对于负载型钒氧化物催化剂，丙烷氧化脱氢的初始步骤涉及钒酰氧原子对氢的抽提，形成双自由基中间体。催化剂的结构，特别是硅胶上的单体钒氧化物物种，在这一机理中起着关键作用。

钒的表面覆盖度影响催化剂的活性。对于V2O5/SiO2催化剂，当覆盖度低于3 V/nm2时，在不同温度下观察到特定的转化频率，表明结构和反应条件都影响效率。

反应机理涉及丙基自由基的脱附，导致气相中的稳态浓度和表面还原位点。快速再氧化使还原位点的浓度相对于氧化位点保持较低，影响整体反应动力学。

与DFT计算的比较表明，当钒氧化物位点作为整体表面的一部分而不是作为单体负载在硅胶上时，可能在丙烷ODH中更活跃。这表明载体材料和活性位点的结构排列对催化活性有显著影响。

这些因素通过决定催化剂在烷烃转化过程中的活性、选择性和整体效率，对其工业重要性做出贡献。理解这些关系允许为特定工业应用设计和优化催化剂。
