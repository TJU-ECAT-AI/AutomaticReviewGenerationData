[1] "Ga-based zeolite catalysts in aromatization reactions focuses on alkylation, isomerization, and disproportionation of aromatics. These reactions have been investigated in detail to optimize product selectivities by utilizing the shape-selective properties of zeolites."

[2] "Isomorphous substitution and replacement of exchangeable cations are important ways to modify zeolite properties for practical applications and have achieved considerable interest in the field of zeolite chemistry."

[3] "The motivation for replacing aluminum in aluminosilicate zeolite structures by other elements arose from the need to adjust their properties to intended applications. The aim of substitution is the complete integration of the modifying element into the framework while preserving the structure type."

[4] "Zeolitic materials are vastly applied as ion exchangers, selective adsorbents, catalysts, and catalyst supports. Industrial applications of zeolites are no longer confined to production of bulk chemicals and to the petroleum refining industry (cracking, hydrocracking, dewaxing, isomerization, alkylation, disproportionation)."

[5] "The breakthrough of gallium-bearing zeolites was found in the aromatization of lower alkanes (Cyclar process) where the activity is ascribed predominantly to nonframework gallium species."

Metal-based catalysts, including supported vanadium oxides and metal-exchanged zeolites, influence alkane transformations through several key factors:

1. Composition: The incorporation of metals like gallium into zeolite frameworks modifies their properties and catalytic behavior. Isomorphous substitution of aluminum by gallium in zeolites allows for tailoring of the catalyst to specific applications.

2. Structure: The shape-selective properties of zeolites play a crucial role in optimizing product selectivities for reactions like alkylation, isomerization, and disproportionation of aromatics. The pore structure of zeolites can influence the accessibility and diffusion of reactants and products.

3. Reaction conditions: Factors such as temperature, pressure, and reactant composition can affect the performance of metal-based catalysts in alkane transformations.

4. Active sites: Both framework and non-framework metal species contribute to catalytic activity. For example, in gallium-bearing zeolites, non-framework gallium species are primarily responsible for the aromatization of lower alkanes in the Cyclar process.

5. Industrial significance: Metal-modified zeolites have found widespread applications in petroleum refining and bulk chemical production. Their versatility as ion exchangers, selective adsorbents, and catalysts has led to their use in various industrial processes such as cracking, hydrocracking, dewaxing, isomerization, alkylation, and disproportionation.

The efficiency of alkane transformations is influenced by the interplay between these factors, allowing for the design of catalysts with improved activity, selectivity, and stability for specific industrial applications.

金属基催化剂，包括负载的钒氧化物和金属交换的沸石，通过几个关键因素影响烷烃转化：

1. 组成：将镓等金属掺入沸石骨架可以改变其性质和催化行为。用镓同形置换沸石中的铝可以使催化剂适应特定应用。

2. 结构：沸石的形状选择性在优化芳烃烷基化、异构化和歧化反应的产物选择性方面起着关键作用。沸石的孔结构可以影响反应物和产物的可及性和扩散。

3. 反应条件：温度、压力和反应物组成等因素可以影响金属基催化剂在烷烃转化中的性能。

4. 活性位点：骨架和非骨架金属物种都对催化活性有贡献。例如，在含镓沸石中，非骨架镓物种主要负责Cyclar工艺中低级烷烃的芳构化。

5. 工业意义：改性金属沸石在石油精炼和大宗化学品生产中得到广泛应用。它们作为离子交换剂、选择性吸附剂和催化剂的多功能性使其在各种工业过程中得到应用，如裂化、加氢裂化、脱蜡、异构化、烷基化和歧化。

烷烃转化的效率受这些因素相互作用的影响，从而可以设计出具有改进的活性、选择性和稳定性的催化剂，用于特定的工业应用。
