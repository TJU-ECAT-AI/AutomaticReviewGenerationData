[1] "Modification of these zeolites with Zn2+ ions inhibits cracking and increases the rate and selectivity of aromatization."

[2] "It is generally believed that this is connected with acceleration by the modifying Zn2+ ions of dehydrogenation of both light paraffins and the growing chains of oligomers."

[4] "Unlike low-frequency shifts of stretching vibrations that are proportional to the force constants of the ground states of chemical bonds, intensities of vibrational IR bands are directly connected with polarization of chemical bonds. Therefore, they better reflect the ability of adsorbed molecules for subsequent activation via polarization."

The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations. For zeolite-catalyzed reactions, the modification of zeolites with Zn2+ ions plays a crucial role. This modification inhibits cracking and enhances the rate and selectivity of aromatization. The Zn2+ ions accelerate the dehydrogenation of both light paraffins and growing oligomer chains.

The reaction conditions, particularly temperature, affect the transformation process. At room temperature, ethane adsorption on the hydrogen form of ZSM-5 results in the appearance of specific CH stretching bands. However, at elevated temperatures, polarization leads to heterolytic dissociative adsorption and dehydrogenation of ethane.

The study introduces a new approach to understanding catalyst efficiency by focusing on the intensities of vibrational IR bands rather than just low-frequency shifts. These intensities are directly connected to the polarization of chemical bonds and better reflect the ability of adsorbed molecules for subsequent activation via polarization.

This approach provides insights into the selectivity of acid-catalyzed reactions at the molecular level, which is crucial for understanding and improving industrial processes involving alkane transformations. The ability to selectively polarize specific chemical bonds involved in subsequent dissociative adsorption offers a unique perspective on the selectivity of heterogeneous acid catalysis, which has significant implications for industrial applications.

金属基催化剂的组成、结构和反应条件对烷烃转化的机理和效率有显著影响。对于沸石催化反应，用Zn2+离子对沸石进行改性起着关键作用。这种改性抑制了裂解，提高了芳构化的速率和选择性。Zn2+离子加速了轻质烷烃和生长的低聚物链的脱氢过程。

反应条件，特别是温度，影响转化过程。在室温下，乙烷在ZSM-5的氢形式上吸附会产生特定的CH伸缩带。然而，在较高温度下，极化会导致乙烷的异裂解离吸附和脱氢。

该研究引入了一种新方法来理解催化剂效率，重点关注振动IR带的强度，而不仅仅是低频移动。这些强度直接与化学键的极化相连，更好地反映了吸附分子通过极化进行后续活化的能力。

这种方法为在分子水平上理解酸催化反应的选择性提供了见解，这对于理解和改进涉及烷烃转化的工业过程至关重要。选择性地极化随后发生解离吸附的特定化学键的能力，为理解多相酸催化的选择性提供了独特的视角，这对工业应用有重要影响。
