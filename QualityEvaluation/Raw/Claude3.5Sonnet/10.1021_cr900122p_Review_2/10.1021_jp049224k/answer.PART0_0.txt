[1] "Modification of these zeolites with Zn2+ ions inhibits cracking and increases the rate and selectivity of aromatization."

[2] "For spectral measurements, the granulated zeolites with particle dimensions of 0.51 mm were transferred into another part of the optical cell equipped with a CaF2 window."

[3] "Reaction with zinc vapor at 770 K resulted in almost complete disappearance of both the narrow and the broad bands (the dashed line in Figure 1)."

[4] "Below 453 K such dissociative adsorption is irreversible, since the bands from the chemisorbed alkyl species and protons were not removed, even by a very prolonged evacuation."

[5] "The resulting ethylene is most likely involved in a subsequent reaction with acidic protons yielding the grafted oligomeric species that, after heating of the sample at high temperature, contributes to the DRIFT spectrum in the region of CH stretching vibrations."

The literature provides insights into how metal-based catalysts, particularly zinc-exchanged zeolites, influence alkane transformations:

1. Composition: The study focuses on ZnZSM-5 zeolites, prepared either by wet ion exchange or reaction with zinc vapor. The zinc content affects the catalyst's properties and performance.

2. Structure: The zinc ions replace protons in the zeolite structure, occupying cationic positions. This modification alters the zeolite's acidic properties and catalytic behavior.

3. Reaction conditions: Temperature plays a crucial role in the catalytic process. At room temperature, ethane adsorption is mostly molecular. As temperature increases (above 423 K), dissociative adsorption and dehydrogenation occur.

4. Mechanisms: The study reveals a two-step mechanism for ethane transformation:
   a) Heterolytic dissociative adsorption, forming zinc ethyl fragments and acidic protons.
   b) Decomposition of zinc ethyl species at higher temperatures, producing zinc hydrides and ethylene.

5. Efficiency: Zinc modification enhances the rate and selectivity of aromatization while inhibiting cracking reactions, improving the overall efficiency of alkane transformation.

6. Industrial significance: The improved selectivity and inhibition of undesired cracking reactions make zinc-modified zeolites potentially valuable for industrial applications in alkane conversion processes.

The study emphasizes the importance of molecular-level understanding of catalyst-substrate interactions, particularly the role of selective polarization of chemical bonds by active sites in determining reaction pathways and selectivity.

这篇文献提供了关于金属基催化剂，特别是锌交换沸石，如何影响烷烃转化的见解：

1. 组成：研究重点关注ZnZSM-5沸石，通过湿法离子交换或与锌蒸气反应制备。锌含量影响催化剂的性质和性能。

2. 结构：锌离子取代沸石结构中的质子，占据阳离子位置。这种修饰改变了沸石的酸性质和催化行为。

3. 反应条件：温度在催化过程中起着关键作用。在室温下，乙烷吸附主要是分子性的。随着温度升高（高于423 K），发生解离吸附和脱氢。

4. 机理：研究揭示了乙烷转化的两步机理：
   a) 异裂解离吸附，形成锌乙基片段和酸性质子。
   b) 在更高温度下锌乙基物种分解，产生锌氢化物和乙烯。

5. 效率：锌修饰提高了芳构化的速率和选择性，同时抑制了裂化反应，提高了烷烃转化的整体效率。

6. 工业意义：提高的选择性和对不期望的裂化反应的抑制使锌修饰沸石在烷烃转化工艺的工业应用中具有潜在价值。

研究强调了分子水平上理解催化剂-底物相互作用的重要性，特别是活性位点对化学键选择性极化在决定反应途径和选择性方面的作用。
