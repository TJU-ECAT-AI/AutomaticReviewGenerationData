[1] "Modification of these zeolites with Zn2+ ions inhibits cracking and increases the rate and selectivity of aromatization."

[2] "As has been shown in our previous studies, both preparation methods resulted in similar DRIFT spectra of adsorbed hydrogen15 or methane.16 The main difference between them is the higher extent of substitution of protons by zinc ions for reaction with zinc vapor."

[3] "Adsorption of ethane by the hydrogen form of ZSM-5 at room temperature resulted in the appearance of four CH stretching bands at 2878, 2920, 2941, and 2974 cm-1"

[4] "After evacuation of ethane at room temperature, three new bands with maxima at 2874, 2910, and 2958 cm-1 remained visible in the region of the CH stretching vibrations (the dotted line in Figure 5). Together with the simultaneous reappearance of acidic hydroxyl groups, this indicates heterolytic dissociative adsorption of ethane resulting in formation of the grafted zinc ethyl fragments and acidic protons"

[5] "The resulting ethylene is most likely involved in a subsequent reaction with acidic protons yielding the grafted oligomeric species that, after heating of the sample at high temperature, contributes to the DRIFT spectrum in the region of CH stretching vibrations."

The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations. For zeolite-catalyzed reactions, the modification of ZSM-5 zeolites with Zn2+ ions inhibits cracking and enhances aromatization rate and selectivity. The method of zinc incorporation affects the extent of proton substitution, with vapor deposition resulting in higher zinc content compared to ion exchange.

The reaction conditions, particularly temperature, play a crucial role in the transformation process. At room temperature, ethane adsorption on ZSM-5 is weak and reversible. However, when Zn2+ ions are present, a stronger form of molecular adsorption occurs, characterized by a broad, low-frequency shifted IR band. This indicates a significant perturbation and polarization of the adsorbed ethane molecules.

As temperature increases, heterolytic dissociative adsorption of ethane occurs, forming zinc ethyl fragments and acidic protons. Further heating leads to the decomposition of zinc ethyl species, producing zinc hydrides and ethylene. The ethylene can then react with acidic protons to form oligomeric species.

These findings demonstrate how the composition of the catalyst (presence of Zn2+ ions), its structure (zeolite framework), and reaction conditions (temperature) influence the mechanism of ethane transformation. The ability to control these factors contributes to the industrial significance of these catalysts, as they can be tailored to promote specific reactions such as aromatization or dehydrogenation while suppressing undesired side reactions like cracking.

金属基催化剂的组成、结构和反应条件显著影响烷烃转化的机理和效率。对于沸石催化反应，用Zn2+离子改性ZSM-5沸石可抑制裂解，提高芳构化速率和选择性。锌的引入方法影响质子取代程度，蒸汽沉积法比离子交换法能获得更高的锌含量。

反应条件，尤其是温度，在转化过程中起着关键作用。在室温下，乙烷在ZSM-5上的吸附是弱的且可逆的。然而，当存在Zn2+离子时，会发生更强的分子吸附形式，表现为一个宽阔的、低频移动的红外谱带。这表明吸附的乙烷分子发生了显著的扰动和极化。

随着温度升高，乙烷发生异裂解离吸附，形成锌乙基片段和酸性质子。进一步加热导致锌乙基物种分解，产生锌氢化物和乙烯。乙烯随后可与酸性质子反应形成寡聚物。

这些发现表明催化剂的组成（Zn2+离子的存在）、结构（沸石骨架）和反应条件（温度）如何影响乙烷转化的机理。控制这些因素的能力对这些催化剂的工业意义做出了贡献，因为它们可以被调整以促进特定反应（如芳构化或脱氢），同时抑制不需要的副反应（如裂解）。
