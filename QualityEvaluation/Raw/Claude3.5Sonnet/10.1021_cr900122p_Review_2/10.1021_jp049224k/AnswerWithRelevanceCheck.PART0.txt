          [1] "Modification of these zeolites with Zn2+ ions inhibits cracking and increases the rate and selectivity of aromatization."

[2] "It is generally believed that this is connected with acceleration by the modifying Zn2+ ions of dehydrogenation of both light paraffins and the growing chains of oligomers."

[3] "For spectral measurements, the granulated zeolites with particle dimensions of 0.51 mm were transferred into another part of the optical cell equipped with a CaF2 window."

[4] "Reaction with zinc vapor at 770 K resulted in almost complete disappearance of both the narrow and the broad bands (the dashed line in Figure 1)."

[5] "Below 453 K such dissociative adsorption is irreversible, since the bands from the chemisorbed alkyl species and protons were not removed, even by a very prolonged evacuation."

[6] "The resulting ethylene is most likely involved in a subsequent reaction with acidic protons yielding the grafted oligomeric species that, after heating of the sample at high temperature, contributes to the DRIFT spectrum in the region of CH stretching vibrations."

          The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts, particularly zinc-modified zeolites, significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations. Key findings include:

1. Composition: Modification of zeolites with Zn2+ ions inhibits cracking and increases the rate and selectivity of aromatization. Zinc can be incorporated through wet ion exchange or reaction with zinc vapor, with vapor deposition resulting in higher zinc content.

2. Structure: The study uses ZSM-5 type zeolites with particle dimensions of 0.51 mm. Zinc ions replace acidic protons in the zeolite structure, altering its catalytic properties.

3. Reaction conditions: Temperature plays a crucial role. At room temperature, ethane adsorption is mostly molecular. As temperature increases (above 423 K), dissociative adsorption and dehydrogenation occur. The process becomes irreversible below 453 K.

4. Mechanisms: The transformation involves several steps:
   a) Strong molecular adsorption on zinc sites
   b) Heterolytic dissociative adsorption forming zinc ethyl fragments and acidic protons
   c) Decomposition of zinc ethyl species into zinc hydrides and ethylene at higher temperatures
   d) Subsequent reaction of ethylene with acidic protons, forming oligomeric species

5. Efficiency: Zinc modification enhances aromatization selectivity while inhibiting cracking reactions. The strong adsorption of ethane is relatively stable, requiring prolonged evacuation for removal.

6. Industrial significance: The ability to tailor catalyst composition to enhance desired reactions (e.g., aromatization, dehydrogenation) while suppressing unwanted ones (e.g., cracking) under relatively mild conditions has potential for industrial applications in alkane conversion processes.

The study emphasizes the importance of understanding catalyst-substrate interactions at the molecular level, particularly the role of selective polarization of chemical bonds by active sites in determining reaction pathways and selectivity.

          金属基催化剂的组成、结构和反应条件，特别是锌改性沸石，对烷烃转化的机理和效率有显著影响。主要发现包括：

1. 组成：用Zn2+离子改性沸石可抑制裂解，提高芳构化的速率和选择性。锌可通过湿法离子交换或与锌蒸气反应引入，蒸汽沉积法能获得更高的锌含量。

2. 结构：研究使用了粒径为0.51毫米的ZSM-5型沸石。锌离子替换了沸石结构中的酸性质子，改变了其催化性能。

3. 反应条件：温度起着关键作用。室温下，乙烷吸附主要是分子性的。随着温度升高（高于423 K），发生解离吸附和脱氢。在453 K以下，该过程变得不可逆。

4. 机理：转化过程包括几个步骤：
   a) 在锌位点上的强分子吸附
   b) 异裂解离吸附形成锌乙基片段和酸性质子
   c) 在更高温度下锌乙基物种分解为锌氢化物和乙烯
   d) 乙烯随后与酸性质子反应，形成寡聚物

5. 效率：锌改性提高了芳构化选择性，同时抑制了裂解反应。乙烷的强吸附相对稳定，需要长时间抽真空才能去除。

6. 工业意义：在相对温和的条件下，能够调整催化剂组成以增强所需反应（如芳构化、脱氢）同时抑制不需要的反应（如裂解），这在烷烃转化工艺的工业应用中具有潜力。

研究强调了理解分子水平上催化剂-底物相互作用的重要性，特别是活性位点对化学键选择性极化在决定反应途径和选择性方面的作用。
