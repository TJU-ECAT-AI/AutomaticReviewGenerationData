[1] "The high temperature oxidation of CH4 to HCHO may be carried out over pure SiO2 and V2O5/SiO5. In the single-pass mode, the HCHO yields do not exceed 34%; however, respectable spacetime-yields (STY) of about 1200 g/kg cat h at 30% selectivity have been achieved over a 2% V2O5/SiO2 catalyst at 600C [20]."

[2] "Several bifunctional catalysts are known to promote this reaction, with the most thoroughly studied being a Mo/H-ZSM-5 zeolite [3538]."

[3] "Most investigators agree that molybdenum carbide or oxycarbide is responsible for the conversion of CH4 to C2H4 and that the C2H4 is converted to aromatic products over the acidic sites within the channels of the zeolite."

[4] "Other metals including W and Fe are effective for promoting this reaction, and there is evidence that these metals are active as suboxides, rather than as carbides [37]. A W, Zn/H-ZSM-5 catalyst, prepared by Zhang and co-workers [38] via a controlled impregnation technique, is of particular interest because a CH4 conversion of 23% at 850C, with high benzene selectivity, has been observed."

The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations:

1. For oxidative dehydrogenation, supported vanadium oxide catalysts like V2O5/SiO2 show promising performance. A 2% V2O5/SiO2 catalyst achieves respectable space-time yields of about 1200 g/kg cat h at 30% selectivity for formaldehyde production from methane at 600°C.

2. In zeolite-catalyzed reactions, bifunctional catalysts like Mo/H-ZSM-5 are effective for methane conversion. The molybdenum component, likely in the form of carbide or oxycarbide, is responsible for converting CH4 to C2H4. The acidic sites within the zeolite channels then convert C2H4 to aromatic products.

3. Other metals such as W and Fe are also effective in promoting these reactions. These metals are believed to be active as suboxides rather than carbides.

4. Catalyst preparation methods impact performance. A W, Zn/H-ZSM-5 catalyst prepared via controlled impregnation achieved 23% methane conversion at 850°C with high benzene selectivity.

The industrial significance of these catalysts is driven by their ability to convert methane, an abundant resource, into more valuable chemicals and fuels. Factors contributing to their importance include high conversion rates, selectivity towards desired products, and the ability to operate at industrially relevant temperatures and pressures.

金属基催化剂的组成、结构和反应条件显著影响烷烃转化的机理和效率：

1. 对于氧化脱氢反应，负载型钒氧化物催化剂如V2O5/SiO2表现出良好性能。2% V2O5/SiO2催化剂在600°C下实现了甲烷制甲醛的可观空时产率，约为1200 g/kg cat h，选择性为30%。

2. 在分子筛催化反应中，双功能催化剂如Mo/H-ZSM-5对甲烷转化效果显著。钼组分，可能以碳化物或氧碳化物形式存在，负责将CH4转化为C2H4。随后，分子筛孔道内的酸性位将C2H4转化为芳烃产物。

3. 其他金属如W和Fe也能有效促进这些反应。这些金属被认为是以亚氧化物而非碳化物的形式发挥活性。

4. 催化剂制备方法影响性能。通过控制浸渍法制备的W, Zn/H-ZSM-5催化剂在850°C下实现了23%的甲烷转化率，并具有高苯选择性。

这些催化剂的工业重要性源于它们将丰富的甲烷资源转化为更有价值的化学品和燃料的能力。影响其重要性的因素包括高转化率、对目标产物的选择性，以及在工业相关温度和压力下运行的能力。
