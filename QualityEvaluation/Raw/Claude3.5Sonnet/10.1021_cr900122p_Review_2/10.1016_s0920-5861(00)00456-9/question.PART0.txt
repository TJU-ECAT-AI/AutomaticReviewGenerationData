Catalytic conversion of methane to more useful chemicals and
fuels: a challenge for the 21st century

Abstract
The very large reserves of methane, which often are found in remote regions, could serve as a feedstock for the production
of chemicals and as a source of energy well into the 21st century. Although methane currently is being used in such important
applications as the heating of homes and the generation of hydrogen for ammonia synthesis, its potential for the production
of ethylene or liquid hydrocarbon fuels has not been fully realized. A number of strategies are being explored at levels
that range from fundamental science to engineering technology. These include: (a) stream and carbon dioxide reforming or
partial oxidation of methane to form carbon monoxide and hydrogen, followed by FischerTropsch chemistry, (b) the direct
oxidation of methane to methanol and formaldehyde, (c) oxidative coupling of methane to ethylene, and (d) direct conversion
to aromatics and hydrogen in the absence of oxygen. Each alternative has its own set of limitations; however, economical
separation is common to all with the most important issues being the separation of oxygen from air and the separation of
hydrogen or hydrocarbons from dilute product streams. Extensive utilization of methane for the production of fuels and
chemicals appears to be near, but current economic uncertainties limit the amount of research activity and the implementation
of emerging technologies.  2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

1. Introduction
Methane, which is the principal component of most
natural gas reserves is currently being used for home
and industrial heating as well as for the generation of
electrical power. In many respects, methane is an ideal
fuel for these purposes because of its availability in
most populated centers, its ease of purification to re-
move sulfur compounds and the fact that among the
hydrocarbons, it has the largest heat of combustion rel-
ative to the amount of CO2 formed. On the other hand,
methane is a greatly underutilized resource for chem-
icals and liquid fuels. The known reserves are enor-
mous and rival those of liquid petroleum, as shown in

Fig. 1 [1]. Moreover, the reserves are increasing more
rapidly than those of liquid petroleum, and it is an-
ticipated that this trend will extend well into the 21st
century.
The geographical distribution of methane (natural
gas) is given in Fig. 2 [1]. Much of the methane is
found in regions that are far removed from industrial
complexes and often it is produced off shore. Pipelines
may not be available for transporting this remote gas
to potential markets and liquefaction for shipping by
ocean-going vessels is expensive. Approximately 11%
of this gas is reinjected, and unfortunately, another 4%
is flared or vented [2], which is a waste of a hydrocar-
bon resource. Both methane itself and carbon dioxide
derived from methane are greenhouse gases.
Strategies for the use of methane depend on its
price and location, the demand for products, construc-

tion costs, the economic and political stability of a re-
gion, and many other factors. Methane (natural gas)
frequently is produced along with liquid petroleum
and some contracts require that the producer takes
the gas along with the oil. Because of this arrange-
ment, the methane may actually have negative value,
i.e., it is a liability to the producer. In such cases,
the methane is essentially free for the taking, but, of
course, the capital and operating costs necessary to uti-
lize this methane may be prohibitively high. Consid-
eration should also be given to the very large amount
of methane that is present in certain reservoirs. Exten-

sive utilization of this methane would require its con-
version either to a transportation fuel or to a limited
number of high volume chemicals such as methanol
or ethylene.
Three examples will illustrate the challenges, and
in some cases the solutions that have been adopted.
(1) On the North Slope of Alaska, the natural gas re-
serves exceed the liquid petroleum reserves. There is
a pipeline for the transportation of liquids to a port in
the southern part of Alaska, but the gas is reinjected
into the reservoir. As the oil becomes depleted, an
increasing amount of gas will be recycled per barrel
of oil produced. (2) In Western Australia, a large
liquefaction facility has been constructed to utilize
the methane. The liquefied gas is shipped to Japan.
(3) In Malaysia, Shell has built a FischerTropsch
(FT) plant to produce a variety of fuels, as well as
waxes. This plant has been shut down for a number
of months because of an explosion, but it is sched-
uled to be in operation sometime during 2000 [3].
In a free market economy, the profitability of these
facilities will depend on the selling price of the prod-
uct and the cost of alternative technologies, both of
which may fluctuate significantly over a relatively
short period. At the time of this writing, crude oil
is selling for ca. $25 per barrel, which makes the
production of high grade fuels from methane more
attractive.

2. Indirect methods for methane utilization
2.1. Synthesis gas production
All indirect methods for the utilization of methane
require carbon monoxide and hydrogen synthesis gas.
Here, we are not considering the use of only H2 as
needed for fuel cells and ammonia synthesis. The pro-
duction of CO and H2 in the appropriate ratios is
achieved through three principal processes or combi-
nations thereof:
1. Steam reforming,
2. Carbon dioxide (or dry) reforming, and
3. Partial oxidation.
Each of these processes has advantages and disad-
vantages, although the trend has been to partial oxi-
dation. Methane reforming reactions [2]
CH4 + H2O
CO + 3H2
(1H 0
298 K = 206 kJ/mol)
(1)
CH4 + CO2
2CO + 2H2

(2)
are highly endothermic and require extensive heat
transfer equipment. By contrast, partial oxidation
CH4 + 1
2O2
CO + 2H2
(1H 0
298 K = 35 kJ/mol)
(3)
is slightly exothermic, but requires oxygen or air. At
a mechanistic level, over most catalysts, partial oxida-
tion involves total combustion of part of the CH4, fol-
lowed by reforming of the remaining CH4 with CO2
and H2O [4,5]. These two steps (total combustion and
reforming) may be formally separated in a process
known as autothermal reforming. As a complement to
these three methods for synthesis gas formation, the
water gas shift reaction
CO + H2O
CO2 + H2
(1H 0
298 K = 41 kJ/mol)
(4)
may be used to adjust the H2/CO ratio. Again, at a
fundamental level, the water gas shift reaction occurs
simultaneously with reactions (1) and (3).
Steam reforming is a mature technology and is
widely used to generate syngas for the production
of methanol. The process, however, requires elevated
temperatures and high pressures of steam in order
to favor H2 and CO at equilibrium. Moreover, the
nickel catalyst is subject to coke formation. Catalytic
partial oxidation, with the use of nearly pure O2,
circumvents the coking problem, but requires the sep-
aration of oxygen from air and involves the hazards
of handling large quantities of undiluted oxygen, as
well as O2/CH4 mixtures. The explosion at the Shell
FT plant occurred in the oxygen separation facility
[3]. Heat management issues are common to both
processes; with steam reforming, large quantities of
heat must be supplied, whereas, with catalytic partial
oxidation, a large amount of heat is released during
the front end of the catalyst bed as the CH4 undergoes
total oxidation. There are reports that over certain
catalysts such as Ru/TiO2 the partial oxidation reac-
tion occurs directly, i.e., without the initial formation
of CO2 and H2O [6]. From the standpoint of heat
removal, these catalysts would provide a definite ad-
vantage for the partial oxidation of methane, assuming
that coke formation did not become a problem.
2.2. Synthesis of methanol: a route to dimethyl ether
(DME), gasoline and ethylene
A major advance in methanol synthesis occurred
in 1966 when ICI introduced a lower pressure pro-
cess that was based on a more active copper/zinc ox-
ide/alumina catalyst. The mechanism for the reaction
and the active phase of the catalyst have been reviewed
by Chinchen et al. [7]. Surprisingly, methanol is ac-
tually formed from CO2 that is produced during the
water gas shift reaction. Under normal operating con-
ditions, CO2 is added to the feed gas. Although there
appear to be limited opportunities for further devel-
opment of the copper-based catalyst, other more ro-
bust and sulfur tolerant catalysts may utilize supported
palladium as the active component. Palladium on sev-
eral basic oxide supports, including La2O3 [8] and
lithium-promoted palladium on SiO2 [9,10], is an ac-
tive and selective catalyst for methanol synthesis that
could find application in slurry reactors.
With respect to methane utilization, the major ad-
vance has been in the scale of methanol synthesis
plants which are consistent with the production of
fuels (see below). According to Vora et al. [11], a
single-train methanol plant with a capacity in the range
168
J.H. Lunsford / Catalysis Today 63 (2000) 165174
of 500010,000 metric tons per day is possible. Large
scale methanol synthesis plants have recently been
constructed to meet the demand for methyl t-butyl
ether (MTBE), which is a fuel additive, but recent envi-
ronmental concerns make the continued use of MTBE
unlikely. As a consequence, there is a large oversup-
ply of methanol from which alternative fuels could be
produced.
One such conceivable process is the conversion of
methanol to DME, which has been touted by Amoco
as a fuel for the 21st century [12]. DME has several
properties that make it attractive as a fuel for diesel
engines, including no sulfur and very low particulate
emission. In addition, DME is one of the best fuels
with respect to greenhouse gas emissions. The low
boiling point (25C) is both an advantage with re-
spect to combustion and a disadvantage with respect
to storage. As with any alternative transportation fuel,
the vehicles and the distribution system would have to
be modified.
The only commercial methanol-to-fuel process
was carried out for a period of several years in New
Zealand as a response to the energy crises in the
early 1970s. Mobil developed a methanol-to-gasoline
(MTG) process that utilized an H-ZSM-5 zeolite
catalyst [13]. The MTG process yields high octane
gasoline that is rich in aromatics, which would make
it unsuitable for use under current regulations in many
countries. The initial steps of the reaction mechanism
are similar to those described below for SAPO-34, but
the stronger acidity of the H-ZSM-5 catalyst promotes
extensive aromatization. Because deactivation is rel-
atively slow, it is possible to use a fixed bed-reactor
with an excess of catalyst. The facility at Motonui,
New Zealand, performed quite well; however, the
cost of the product eventually became noncompeti-
tive with that of gasoline produced at conventional
refineries, and the facility was eventually modified to
produce only methanol. Nevertheless, the technical
success demonstrates that methane can be converted
to fuels and chemicals (aromatics) via methanol on a
commercial scale.
Two other potential large scale chemical products
from methane, via methanol, are ethylene and propy-
lene. Methanol may be converted to these chemicals
over a moderately acidic SAPO-34 molecular sieve,
and a methanol-to-olefin (MTO) process has been de-
veloped by UOP [14]. Ethylene, which is the pri-
mary product, oligomerizes and cracks to propylene.
The catalyst deactivates rapidly and regeneration is
required. This is achieved in a fluidized bed-reactor
which is similar to those employed in conventional
catalytic cracking. Utilization of this technology prob-
ably will occur in integrated petrochemical complexes
(e.g., in Saudi Arabia) rather than in remote locations.
2.3. FT synthesis
FT synthesis for the production of hydrocarbons
and higher alcohols has a rich history that dates back
to the early 1920s. A brief overview of the process
has recently been given by Schulz [15]. Originally,
coal was considered as the primary source of carbon
for the synthesis gas, but currently, increased attention
is being given to methane for the reasons described
above. The catalysts employed are based on cobalt or
iron with the addition of ruthenium to improve the
yield of waxes. Through catalyst improvement and
process modification, alpha values of 0.9 have been
achieved, which means that the products will contain
a significant fraction of hydrocarbons having a high
carbon number (>C20).
The Shell middle distillate synthesis (SMDS)
process, which operated on a commercial scale of
12,000 bbl per day for over 4 years, yielded both
high quality fuels and chemicals such as waxes and
solvents [16]. In addition to the FT component, the
plant includes a hydrocracker that forms the mid-
dle distillate products. As a refinery, the facility is
quite small, but as a chemical plant, it is very large.
This venture by Shell illustrates both the pitfalls and
the opportunities that await us in the 21st century
as methane becomes more widely employed for the
production of fuels and chemicals. It should also be
noted that Sasol in South Africa is a leader in FT
technologies, although their commercial process is
based on coal gasification [17]. Nevertheless, the
slurry reactors that they have developed could also be
used with natural gas as the feedstock.
3. Direct methods for methane utilization
Direct methods for the conversion of methane to
the desired products circumvent the expensive syngas
step; however, in two of the examples described here,

oxygen separation from air is still required. Concep-
tually, direct methods should have a distinct economic
advantage over indirect methods, but to date, no di-
rect processes have progressed to a commercial stage.
Product yields are generally small while operating in
a single-pass mode, which makes separations difficult
and costly.
3.1. Synthesis of methanol and formaldehyde
Perhaps, the greatest potential for a major advance
in methane conversion technology is in the discovery
of a direct route for the formation of the oxygenates
methanol and formaldehyde. The methane mono-
oxygenase (MMO) enzyme, which is able to con-
vert methane to methanol at ambient conditions, is
an enticing example of what could be achieved. The
enzyme activates O2 at iron centers with the aid of
a reductant known as NADH. Using this example,
Otsuka et al. [18] have shown that FePO4 is an inter-
esting model catalyst for the production of CH3OH
and HCHO when H2 is added to the CH4 and O2
reagents. Presumably H2 reacts with O2 to form a
surface peroxide species, which is responsible for the
activation of CH4 as shown in Scheme 1. Methanol
and formaldehyde selectivities of 23 and 45%, re-
spectively, have been achieved, but only at a methane
conversion level of about 0.6%. Formaldehyde is com-
mercially produced by the oxidation of methanol over
iron molybdate catalysts; therefore, one would expect
that it would be formed as a secondary product during
the oxidation of methane at elevated temperatures.
Partial success in the conversion of methane to
methanol has been achieved by Periana et al. [19],
who used a bipyrimidyl platinum (II) complex
in concentrated H2SO4. At 220C, 90% of the
methane reacted with H2SO4 in a catalytic manner
to form methyl bisulfate at 81% selectivity. It is ex-
pected that the methyl bisulfate could be hydrolyzed
to methanol, although this was not demonstrated. A
complete cycle would require the regeneration of the
concentrated H2SO4.
The high temperature oxidation of CH4 to HCHO
may be carried out over pure SiO2 and V2O5/SiO5. In
170
J.H. Lunsford / Catalysis Today 63 (2000) 165174
the single-pass mode, the HCHO yields do not exceed
34%; however, respectable spacetime-yields (STY)
of about 1200 g/kg cat h at 30% selectivity have been
achieved over a 2% V2O5/SiO2 catalyst at 600C [20].
Parmaliana et al. [21] have used a recycle reactor with
continuous removal of HCHO to determine the yields
that could be achieved over a precipitated silica cata-
lyst. At 690C with a recycle ratio of 64, a formalde-
hyde yield of 24.5% was attained. In this case, the
STY was 150 g/kg cat h.
An earlier study using N2O as an oxidant with
MoO3/SiO2 as the catalyst indicated that methoxide
ions resulted from the reaction of methyl radicals
with the metal oxide [22]. These methoxide ions
could either react with water to form methanol or they
could decompose to form formaldehyde. In a separate
study, CH3• radicals derived from the decomposition
of azomethane, CH3N=NCH3, were allowed to react
with MoO3/SiO2, V2O5/SiO2 and V2O5 [23,24]. The
results of Fig. 3 show the selective conversion of
surface methoxide species to CH3OH at temperatures
as low as 200C and to HCHO at temperatures as
low as 350C. If water is present, CH3OH is favored
over HCHO at the lower temperatures. Clearly, these
oxygenates could be produced in high yields by the
activation of methane at low temperatures (<300C).
This is indeed a challenging problem because of the
strength of the CH bond in CH4 (431 kJ/mol), but
an iron peroxide species, such as shown in Scheme 1,
may be able to activate methane. Following this ap-
proach, however, one still has the problem of reduc-
ing the Fe(III) to Fe(II), and it is desirable that this
be achieved with CH4 rather than H2. Furthermore,
the reduction step itself should result in a methoxide
ion.
3.2. Oxidative coupling
In the oxidative coupling reaction, CH4 and O2 re-
act over a catalyst at elevated temperatures to form
C2H6 as a primary product and C2H4 as a secondary
product. Unfortunately, both the CH4 and the C2H4
may be converted to CO2, and the single-pass com-
bined yield of C2H4 and C2H6 (C2 products) is lim-
ited to about 25%. Over the better catalysts, which in-
clude SrO/La2O3 [25] and Mn/Na2WO4/SiO2 [26,27],
a C2 selectivity of about 80% can be achieved at a
CH4 conversion of 20%. About half of the C2 is C2H4
Fig. 3. Temperature-programmed surface reaction results after re-
action of 3 mTorr CH3• radicals with 5.1% V2O5/SiO2 for 30 min

(b) sample heated in 7 mTorr H2O: (s) CH3OH, (m) HCHO, (e)
CO, (d) CO2 [24].
and half is C2H6, although the C2H4/C2H6 ratio can
be enhanced by using a second catalyst. The high C2
selectivities are almost always achieved under oxy-
gen limiting conditions; thus, the specific activity of
the catalyst is not a factor. Because the overall re-
action is exothermic, a zone within the catalyst bed
may be 150300C hotter than the external tempera-
ture [28,45]. Heat management, therefore, is a serious
engineering problem. This is complicated by the fact
that metals normally used for construction of reactors
catalyze the total combustion of methane.
The reaction network is interesting from a fun-
damental perspective because it is an example of a
heterogeneoushomogeneous system. Methyl radicals
that are formed at the surface of the catalyst enter
the gas phase where they couple to form ethane. At
atmospheric pressure, this coupling occurs mainly in
the void space between catalyst particles, but by two
techniques, the methyl radicals have been detected in
J.H. Lunsford / Catalysis Today 63 (2000) 165174
171
the gas phase after they exit the catalyst bed [29,30].
In addition to coupling, the gas phase radicals may
enter into chain reactions that result in the formation
of CO and subsequently CO2. Isotopic labeling ex-
periments have demonstrated that at small conversion
levels most of the CO2 is derived from CH4, but
at commercially significant conversion levels, C2H4
would be the dominant source of CO2 [27]. Addi-
tional experiments have shown that this occurs mainly
via a heterogeneous reaction. One of the challenges
in catalyst development is to modify a material so
that the secondary reaction of C2H4 will be inhibited
while the activation of CH4 will still occur. There is
no inherent reason that these two reactions should
take place on the same types of sites.
In order to avoid the cost associated with the use
of pure O2 in the feed gas, attempts were made
by ARCO to use the catalyst for oxygen storage.
A NaMnO4/MgO catalyst was found to be suitable
for this purpose in that separate pulses of air and
methane resulted in favorable C2 selectivities [31].
But the oxygen storage capacity was limited so that a
very large mass of catalyst would have to be used to
achieve a reasonable amount of C2 products. The fact
that the conversions and selectivities obtained in the
sequential pulse mode were comparable to those ob-
served in the cofeed mode substantiates the claim that
the nonselective reactions are mainly heterogeneous
in nature.
By operating in a recycle mode with continuous
removal of ethylene, a considerable improvement
in the ethylene yield can be achieved. Vayenas and
co-workers [32] demonstrated this concept by using a
closed-loop recycle system with continuous removal
of C2+ olefins. The olefins were adsorbed in a 5 A
molecular sieve at 30C and subsequently desorbed
in an inert gas stream by heating the sieve to 400C.
The resulting ethylene yield was 85%. We developed
a recycle system in which olefins were continuously
removed as a aqueous silver ion complex via a mem-
brane contactor [33]. The aqueous solution was cir-
culated through a regeneration column, where, upon
boiling, it released the olefins (mainly C2H4) into the
gas phase. Olefin product yields greater than 70% were
obtained during continuous operation, but the olefin
productivity was approximately 2 ml (STP)/min. The
rate of olefin recovery was limited by the transport
rate through the membrane.

sion of methane to aromatics. C: mass flow controller; F: flowme-
ter; P: gas sampling port; R: pressure regulator [34].
As a variation of this recycle system, the membrane
contactor was replaced by a Ga/H-ZSM-5 zeolite cat-
alyst that operated at 520C. This zeolite catalyst ef-
fectively converted the C2H4 from the OCM reactor
mainly to benzene and toluene, which were continu-
ously removed by an in-line trap [34]. A scheme of the
system is given in Fig. 4. The aromatic product yield as
a function of the O2 flow rate is given in Fig. 5. Again,
product (aromatic) yields in excess of 70% could be
achieved. To attain these yields, the conversion of the
recycled C2H6 to C2H4 must be highly selective. In
this case, the productivity could be increased simply
by increasing the amounts of the catalysts, the flow
rates and the efficiencies of the traps, thus scale up
would be easier with the Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalyst than
with the membrane contactor.
3.3. Conversion to aromatics without an oxidant
Many of the processes described about, whether di-
rect or indirect, require the use of oxygen, which has

a cost that is either equivalent to or greater than the
cost of methane. The formation of oxygen-containing
products provides a thermodynamic driving force so
that the reaction has a negative free energy. But with
the kinetically controlled direct oxidation reactions,
the formation of the undesirable product CO2 severely
limits the yields that may be achieved. There are, how-
ever, a limited number of methane conversion reac-
tions that result in hydrocarbon products but do not
require an oxidant. The theoretical yield, of course, is
limited by thermodynamic considerations. One such
example is the catalytic conversion of methane to ben-
zene, toluene and naphthalene. The equilibrium for a
CH system at 1 atm is shown in Fig. 6. At 700C, e.g.,
the equilibrium conversion of CH4 would be about
12%, with about half the CH4 going to benzene and
half to naphthalene. The other major product is H2,
which also has significant value. At 800C, the equi-
librium conversion would be about 24%.
Several bifunctional catalysts are known to promote
this reaction, with the most thoroughly studied being
a Mo/H-ZSM-5 zeolite [3538]. The subject has been
reviewed by Xu and Lin [39]. Representative results,
reported by Wang et al. [40], are shown in Figs. 7 and
8. One of the objectives of this study was to demon-
strate that the active state of molybdenum was Mo2C,
which may be formed by initially exposing the catalyst
to CH4/H2 mixtures. Several observations can be made

aromatic molecules except naphthalene) at 1 atm pressure [40].
from these results. First, during the time when ben-
zene is being formed, the methane conversion never
reaches the equilibrium limit of 12%, although other
investigators have reported conversions of about 11%

at 700C and 18% at 750C [41]. Second, after an
initial rapid decline in activity, the rate of decline af-
ter ca. 4 h on stream is slow. Third, a nearly constant
benzene selectivity of about 60% is achieved, but the
naphthalene selectivity goes through a maximum after
12 h on stream. Meanwhile, the toluene selectivity
continuously increases. The maximum in the naphtha-
lene selectivity has been attributed to shape selectivity
which is more pronounced as the zeolite channels be-
come partially coked. Ichikawa and co-workers [42]
have shown that the addition of small amounts of CO
or CO2 to the feed inhibits the deactivation of the cat-
alyst.
Two fundamental issues continue to be discussed
in literature; namely, (i) the state and location of the
active form of molybdenum, and (ii) the mechanism
of the reaction. Most investigators agree that molyb-
denum carbide or oxycarbide is responsible for the
conversion of CH4 to C2H4 and that the C2H4 is con-
verted to aromatic products over the acidic sites within
the channels of the zeolite. Other metals including W
and Fe are effective for promoting this reaction, and
there is evidence that these metals are active as subox-
ides, rather than as carbides [37]. A W, Zn/H-ZSM-5
catalyst, prepared by Zhang and co-workers [38] via
a controlled impregnation technique, is of particular
interest because a CH4 conversion of 23% at 850C,
with high benzene selectivity, has been observed. This
conversion is approaching the level that might be com-
mercially attractive for the production of aromatics
from methane.
4. Separation technology
Improvements in separation technology are essen-
tial for the practical utilization of all of the processes
described above. In particular, there is a need for less
expensive O2 to be used in the partial oxidation of
methane and the oxidative coupling reaction. Like-
wise, there is a need for new or improved methods
to separate methanol, olefins or aromatics from dilute
streams. Such separations would find application not
only in CH4 conversion processes, but also in refin-
ery operations. Removal of H2, perhaps by membrane
separation [43], would shift the equilibrium in the di-
rect methane-to-aromatics process, and would allow
larger conversions to be achieved.
5. Conclusions
A number of strategies are being explored and de-
veloped for the conversion of methane to more useful
chemicals and fuels. These may be broadly divided
into two groups, which are described as indirect and
direct. The indirect processes rely upon the formation
of synthesis gas (CO and H2) either by reforming re-
actions or by partial oxidation. In the direct processes,
methane may be converted to methanol, formaldehyde,
ethylene or aromatics. The stage of development of
the several processes varies greatly, with the indirect
ones being more advanced than the direct ones. For ex-
ample, steam reforming of methane, with subsequent
methanol synthesis, is a mature technology, while the
indirect conversion of methane to methanol is at the
level of fundamental discovery. Each of the alterna-
tives has its own limitations; however, economical sep-
aration is common to all, with the most important is-
sues being the separation of oxygen from air and the

separation of hydrogen or hydrocarbons from dilute
product streams. Catalyst development has played a
crucial role in the advances that have occurred; nev-
ertheless, there remains a need for catalysts that pro-
mote higher selectivity to the desired product and have
a longer life.
There are many parallels between the challenge of
ammonia synthesis at the beginning of the 20th cen-
tury and the effective utilization of methane at the
beginning of the 21st century. A successful ammo-
nia synthesis process depended not only on persis-
tent catalyst development, but also on major advances
in process engineering which resulted in high purity
reagents and reactors that withstood both elevated tem-
peratures and high pressures [44]. Similarly, success-
ful methane conversion will require catalyst innova-
tions and novel engineering developments. Moreover,
there is a need for industrial leadership such as that
provided by BASF for the ammonia synthesis process.
