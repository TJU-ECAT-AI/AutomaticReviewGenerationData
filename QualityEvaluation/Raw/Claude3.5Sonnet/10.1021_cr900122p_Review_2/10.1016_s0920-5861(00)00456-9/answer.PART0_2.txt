[1] "Over pure SiO2 and V2O5/SiO5. In the single-pass mode, the HCHO yields do not exceed 34%; however, respectable spacetime-yields (STY) of about 1200 g/kg cat h at 30% selectivity have been achieved over a 2% V2O5/SiO2 catalyst at 600C"

[2] "Several bifunctional catalysts are known to promote this reaction, with the most thoroughly studied being a Mo/H-ZSM-5 zeolite"

[3] "Most investigators agree that molybdenum carbide or oxycarbide is responsible for the conversion of CH4 to C2H4 and that the C2H4 is converted to aromatic products over the acidic sites within the channels of the zeolite."

[4] "A W, Zn/H-ZSM-5 catalyst, prepared by Zhang and co-workers [38] via a controlled impregnation technique, is of particular interest because a CH4 conversion of 23% at 850C, with high benzene selectivity, has been observed."

The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations:

1. Supported vanadium oxides: V2O5/SiO2 catalysts show respectable space-time yields for formaldehyde production from methane oxidation, with 2% V2O5/SiO2 achieving 1200 g/kg cat h at 30% selectivity at 600°C.

2. Metal-exchanged zeolites: Mo/H-ZSM-5 is extensively studied for methane conversion to aromatics. The active form is believed to be molybdenum carbide or oxycarbide, responsible for converting CH4 to C2H4. The acidic sites within zeolite channels then convert C2H4 to aromatics.

3. Bifunctional catalysts: W, Zn/H-ZSM-5 prepared via controlled impregnation shows high methane conversion (23% at 850°C) with high benzene selectivity, demonstrating the importance of catalyst preparation techniques.

4. Reaction conditions: Temperature plays a crucial role, with higher temperatures generally favoring increased conversion, as seen in the W, Zn/H-ZSM-5 example operating at 850°C.

These factors contribute to industrial significance by improving yields, selectivity, and conversion rates, which are critical for economically viable processes. The development of more efficient catalysts and optimized reaction conditions can lead to improved methane utilization and potentially more sustainable chemical production processes.

金属基催化剂的组成、结构和反应条件对烷烃转化的机理和效率有显著影响：

1. 负载型钒氧化物：V2O5/SiO2催化剂在甲烷氧化生成甲醛方面显示出可观的空时产率，2% V2O5/SiO2在600°C下实现了1200 g/kg cat h的产率，选择性为30%。

2. 金属交换沸石：Mo/H-ZSM-5被广泛研究用于甲烷转化为芳烃。活性形式被认为是碳化钼或氧碳化物，负责将CH4转化为C2H4。然后，沸石孔道内的酸性位点将C2H4转化为芳烃。

3. 双功能催化剂：通过控制浸渍法制备的W, Zn/H-ZSM-5显示出高甲烷转化率（850°C下23%）和高苯选择性，证明了催化剂制备技术的重要性。

4. 反应条件：温度起着关键作用，较高温度通常有利于提高转化率，如W, Zn/H-ZSM-5例子在850°C下运行所示。

这些因素通过提高产率、选择性和转化率，对工业意义做出贡献，这些对经济可行的过程至关重要。开发更高效的催化剂和优化反应条件可以带来更好的甲烷利用，并可能实现更可持续的化学品生产过程。
