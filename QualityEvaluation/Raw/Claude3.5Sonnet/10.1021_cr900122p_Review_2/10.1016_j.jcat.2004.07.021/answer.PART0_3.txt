[1] "Acid ZSM-5 zeolites modified by gallium ions are known to be active catalysts for the aromatization of light paraffins [1]."

[2] "Modification of the hydrogen form by gallium was carried out by incipient wetness impregnation with an aqueous solution of Ga(NO3)3. The amount of modifying gallium ions was chosen to be 5 wt% corresponding to a Ga/Al atomic ratio of about unity."

[3] "After reduction in hydrogen at 773 K the intensity of the DRIFT band from acidic OH groups around 3610 cm−1 gradually decreased. This indicates substitution of the bridging hydroxyl groups by the modifying gallium ions."

[4] "Reduction of GaZSM-5 in hydrogen at 773 K and subsequent prolonged evacuation at 873 K did not show any infrared bands in the spectral range of 1900–2100 cm−1 associated with gallium hydrides [17]. These bands were also not observed after admission of hydrogen to the evacuated samples at room temperature. However, heating of such samples in a hydrogen atmosphere to 773 K with subsequent cooling of the zeolite in hydrogen to room temperature resulted in the appearance of two bands with maxima at 2041 and 2059 cm−1 (Fig. 5). We surmise that these bands relate to two different kinds of gallium hydrides."

The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations in processes like aromatization. Specifically for Ga/ZSM-5 catalysts:

1. Composition: Gallium-modified ZSM-5 zeolites are active catalysts for light paraffin aromatization. The amount of gallium is typically chosen to achieve a Ga/Al ratio of about 1, corresponding to about 5 wt% Ga.

2. Structure: Gallium ions substitute the bridging hydroxyl groups in the zeolite structure upon reduction in hydrogen at high temperatures (773 K). This substitution is evidenced by the decrease in the DRIFT band from acidic OH groups.

3. Reaction conditions: The formation of active gallium species is highly dependent on temperature and atmosphere. Reduction in hydrogen at 773 K leads to the substitution of acid protons by gallium species. Further heating in hydrogen to 773 K followed by cooling results in the formation of gallium hydrides, which are not observed at room temperature.

4. Efficiency: The substitution of acid protons by gallium species and the formation of various gallium hydrides contribute to the catalyst's efficiency in alkane transformations.

These factors contribute to the industrial significance of Ga/ZSM-5 catalysts by providing a means to control the active sites for alkane aromatization through careful manipulation of composition and reaction conditions.

金属基催化剂的组成、结构和反应条件显著影响烷烃转化过程(如芳构化)的机理和效率。具体对于Ga/ZSM-5催化剂:

1. 组成:镓改性的ZSM-5分子筛是轻质烷烃芳构化的活性催化剂。镓的含量通常选择达到Ga/Al比约为1,对应约5 wt%的Ga。

2. 结构:在高温(773 K)氢气中还原时,镓离子取代分子筛结构中的桥接羟基。这种取代可以通过酸性OH基团DRIFT谱带的减弱来证实。

3. 反应条件:活性镓物种的形成高度依赖于温度和气氛。在773 K氢气中还原导致酸质子被镓物种取代。进一步在氢气中加热到773 K后冷却会形成镓氢化物,这些氢化物在室温下不会观察到。

4. 效率:酸质子被镓物种取代以及各种镓氢化物的形成有助于提高催化剂在烷烃转化中的效率。

这些因素通过仔细控制组成和反应条件来调控烷烃芳构化的活性位点,从而促进了Ga/ZSM-5催化剂的工业重要性。
