          [1] "Unpromoted HZSM-5 is, however, a poor dehydrogenation catalyst; addition of promoters is required for such application."

[2] "Modification of the zeolite with zinc or gallium has been successful for this purpose."

[3] "For the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane and n-butane, it has been reported that the alkene yield is highest over Fe3+ silicalite, and rapid cracking and combustion of propane occurred over ion-exchanged Fe/ZSM-5 and FeOx/silicalite."

[4] "Upon condensation of the vapor of a volatile precursor on the H-form of the zeolite, the concentration of Brnsted sites is lowered drastically and a high level of ion exchange is obtained. Subsequent treatment with H2O to remove chlorine from the precursor induces hydrolysis of the metal ions."

[5] "Hydrolysis converts naked ions into oxo ions, such as (GaO)+ and (HOFeOFeOH)2+. They are identified by temperature-programmed reduction with H2 and CO and, in the case of the binuclear Fe3+ ion, by ESR spectroscopy."

[6] "The Ga2O3 clusters are easily reduced to Ga+ at 450 C. With (HOFeOFeOH)2+ in cationic exchange positions reduction is reversible at 500 C."

[7] "In the case of Zn/ZSM-5, isolated Zn2+ cations compensate the charge of two Al-centered tetrahedra or attach themselves to one silanol group or ZnOH and one Al-centered tetrahedron. In this state, the Zn ions are stabilized and cannot be reduced below 800 C."

[8] "When Ga, Zn, and Fe replace protons in HZSM-5, they form strong Lewis acid sites."

          The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts, particularly supported vanadium oxides and metal-exchanged zeolites, significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations in processes such as oxidative dehydrogenation and zeolite-catalyzed reactions.

For zeolite-catalyzed reactions, the addition of promoters like zinc or gallium to HZSM-5 improves its dehydrogenation catalytic activity. The method of introducing these metals, such as sublimation of volatile compounds followed by hydrolysis, affects the nature of the active sites. This process reduces Brønsted acid sites and creates strong Lewis acid sites, which can alter the catalyst's activity and selectivity.

The nature of the metal and its oxidation state play crucial roles in oxidative dehydrogenation. For instance, Fe3+ in silicalite shows high alkene yield for propane and n-butane dehydrogenation, while Fe/ZSM-5 promotes cracking and combustion. The structure of the metal species, such as isolated ions, oxo-species, or small clusters, influences the reaction pathway and product distribution.

The preparation method affects the final structure of the metal species in the zeolite. Hydrolysis can create oxo-ions like (GaO)+ and (HOFeOFeOH)2+, which have distinct catalytic properties. The reducibility of these species varies, with Ga2O3 clusters easily reduced at 450°C, (HOFeOFeOH)2+ undergoing reversible reduction at 500°C, and Zn2+ ions stable up to 800°C.

These factors contribute to the industrial significance of metal-exchanged zeolites in alkane transformations. The ability to tune the catalyst's properties through metal selection, preparation method, and post-treatment allows for optimization of activity, selectivity, and stability for specific industrial processes. The combination of strong Lewis acidity from the metal species and the shape-selective properties of the zeolite framework makes these materials particularly attractive for industrial applications in petrochemical processes and fine chemical synthesis.

          金属基催化剂的组成、结构和反应条件，特别是负载的钒氧化物和金属交换沸石，显著影响烷烃转化过程中的机理和效率，尤其是在氧化脱氢和沸石催化反应等过程中。

对于沸石催化反应，向HZSM-5中添加锌或镓等助剂可以改善其脱氢催化活性。引入这些金属的方法，如挥发性化合物的升华后进行水解，会影响活性位点的性质。这个过程减少了布朗斯特酸位，并创造了强路易斯酸位，从而可能改变催化剂的活性和选择性。

在氧化脱氢反应中，金属的性质及其氧化态起着关键作用。例如，硅铁石中的Fe3+对丙烷和正丁烷脱氢显示出高的烯烃产率，而Fe/ZSM-5则促进裂解和燃烧。金属物种的结构，如孤立离子、氧物种或小簇，影响反应途径和产品分布。

制备方法影响沸石中金属物种的最终结构。水解可以形成如(GaO)+和(HOFeOFeOH)2+等氧离子，它们具有独特的催化性质。这些物种的可还原性各不相同，Ga2O3簇在450°C下容易还原，(HOFeOFeOH)2+在500°C下可逆还原，而Zn2+离子在800°C以下保持稳定。

这些因素共同构成了金属交换沸石在烷烃转化中的工业重要性。通过金属选择、制备方法和后处理来调节催化剂的性质，可以针对特定的工业过程优化活性、选择性和稳定性。金属物种提供的强路易斯酸性与沸石骨架的形状选择性相结合，使这些材料在石化过程和精细化学品合成的工业应用中特别具有吸引力。
