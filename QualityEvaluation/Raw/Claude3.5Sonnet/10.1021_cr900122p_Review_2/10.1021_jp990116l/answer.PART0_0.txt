[1] "Unpromoted HZSM-5 is, however, a poor dehydrogenation catalyst; addition of promoters is required for such application. Modification of the zeolite with zinc or gallium has been successful for this purpose."

[2] "Fe silicalite is able to catalyze the one-step oxidation of benzene to phenol with dinitrogen monoxide as the oxidant"

[3] "For the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane and n-butane, it has been reported that the alkene yield is highest over Fe3+ silicalite, and rapid cracking and combustion of propane occurred over ion-exchanged Fe/ZSM-5 and FeOx/silicalite."

[4] "Upon condensation of the vapor of a volatile precursor on the H-form of the zeolite, the concentration of Brnsted sites is lowered drastically and a high level of ion exchange is obtained. Subsequent treatment with H2O to remove chlorine from the precursor induces hydrolysis of the metal ions."

[5] "Hydrolysis converts naked ions into oxo ions, such as (GaO)+ and (HOFeOFeOH)2+. They are identified by temperature-programmed reduction with H2 and CO and, in the case of the binuclear Fe3+ ion, by ESR spectroscopy."

The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations in processes such as oxidative dehydrogenation and zeolite-catalyzed reactions. 

For zeolite-catalyzed reactions, the addition of promoters like zinc or gallium to HZSM-5 improves its dehydrogenation catalytic activity. The method of introducing these metals, such as vapor deposition followed by hydrolysis, affects the nature of the active sites. This process reduces Brønsted acid sites and creates strong Lewis acid sites, which can alter the catalyst's activity and selectivity.

In oxidative dehydrogenation, the nature of the metal and its oxidation state play crucial roles. For instance, Fe3+ in silicalite shows high alkene yield for propane and n-butane dehydrogenation, while Fe/ZSM-5 promotes cracking and combustion. The structure of the metal species, such as isolated ions, oxo-species, or small clusters, influences the reaction pathway and product distribution.

The preparation method affects the final structure of the metal species in the zeolite. Vapor deposition followed by hydrolysis can create oxo-ions like (GaO)+ and (HOFeOFeOH)2+, which have distinct catalytic properties. The reducibility and oxidation state of these species, as identified by TPR and ESR, contribute to their catalytic behavior.

These factors collectively contribute to the industrial significance of metal-exchanged zeolites in alkane transformations. The ability to tune the catalyst's properties through metal selection, preparation method, and post-treatment allows for optimization of activity, selectivity, and stability for specific industrial processes.

金属基催化剂的组成、结构和反应条件显著影响烷烃转化过程中的机理和效率，特别是在氧化脱氢和沸石催化反应等过程中。

对于沸石催化反应，向HZSM-5中添加锌或镓等助剂可以改善其脱氢催化活性。引入这些金属的方法，如蒸气沉积后进行水解，会影响活性位点的性质。这个过程减少了布朗斯特酸位，并创造了强路易斯酸位，从而可能改变催化剂的活性和选择性。

在氧化脱氢反应中，金属的性质及其氧化态起着关键作用。例如，硅铁石中的Fe3+对丙烷和正丁烷脱氢显示出高的烯烃产率，而Fe/ZSM-5则促进裂解和燃烧。金属物种的结构，如孤立离子、氧物种或小簇，影响反应途径和产品分布。

制备方法影响沸石中金属物种的最终结构。蒸气沉积后进行水解可以形成如(GaO)+和(HOFeOFeOH)2+等氧离子，它们具有独特的催化性质。这些物种的可还原性和氧化态，通过TPR和ESR鉴定，对其催化行为有重要贡献。

这些因素共同构成了金属交换沸石在烷烃转化中的工业重要性。通过金属选择、制备方法和后处理来调节催化剂的性质，可以针对特定的工业过程优化活性、选择性和稳定性。
