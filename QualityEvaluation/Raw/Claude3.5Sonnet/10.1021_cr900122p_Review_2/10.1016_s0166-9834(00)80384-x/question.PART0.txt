ABSTRACT 
The conversion 
of light (C, to C,) alkanes to aromatics, 
chiefly benzene, 
toluene and xylenes 
(BTX), 
can be accomplished 
using zeolites of the ZSM-5 type. The conversion 
to aromatics 
is 
not completely 
selective. 
Light alkenes, the probable 
reaction 
intermediates, 
together 
with light 
alkanes, are formed in addition 
to the BTX components. 
On H-ZSM-5, 
all the hydrogen 
atoms 
lost on aromatization 
of the reactant 
alkane seem to appear in the products 
as light alkanes. It 
has been found that, when propane 
is used as the reactant 
at 5OOC and 0.1 MPa, the BTX 
selectivity 
can be increased 
from ca. 10% (H-ZSM-5) 
to ca. 40 to 45% after treatment 
of the base 
zeolite with solutions 
of zinc or gallium nitrate, 
such that the final zinc or gallium content 
is ca. 
1.0 mass-%. 
A comparative 
study of the conversion 
of propane, 
n-butane 
and i-butane 
over Zn- 
ZSM-5 reveals that the alkanes differ in terms of activity 
and BTX selectivity. 
i-Butane 
is the 
most reactive 
of the three alkanes and also yields the highest percentage 
hydrogen 
recovery as 
dihydrogen. 
However, it displays the lowest BTX selectivity. 
INTRODUCTION 
There is a widespread and growing interest in the conversion of light alkanes 
to more useful products. The catalytic conversion of methane in particular to 
methanol [ 1, 21 or higher hydrocarbons [ 3-51 has received much attention. 
In general, the need for a suitable co-reactant to be used with methane in 
order to overcome thermodynamic limitations [ 41 has been recognized. In con- 
trast, the conversion of higher alkanes, such as C&/C, cuts, can proceed in the 
absence of such co-reactants. 
Thus the conversion of methane to acetylene and acetylene-ethylene 
mix- 
tures can be achieved in the absence of co-reactants only at temperatures above 
ca. 1600 C. Much lower temperatures are required for the conversion of higher 
alkanes such as ethane to higher hydrocarbons. Further, as Table 1 shows, 
thermodynamic data [6] reveal that, in general, alkane-to-aromatics conver-

sions become more favourable as the size of the alkane is increased, and that 
aromatics are thermodynamically 
favoured over the corresponding alkene. 
Catalytic dehydrogenation of propane and butane to alkenes is at the heart of 
processes such as Oleflex [ 71, Aromatization processes such as Cyclar [ 
8, 91 
and MB-forming [lo] have also recently been announced. These processes of- 
fer a means of converting light gases to aromatics, especially BTX, 
and are 
based on the use of catalysts such as ZSM-5 and related materials. 
The conversion of light alkanes such as propane and butane to aromatics is 
not completely selective. Light alkenes, the probable reaction intermediates, 
are formed in addition to the BTX 
components. Further, it seems that on 
H-ZSM-5 all of the hydrogen atoms lost on aromatization 
of the reactant al- 
kane appear in the product as light alkanes 
[ 111. This effective transfer of 
hydrogen atoms places a severe restriction on the BTX selectivity that can be 
attained (Fig. 1). For example, with propane, if the sole alkane side-product is 
methane, the maximum BTX selectivity (% carbon basis) is ca. 44 to 49%, but 
if the sole alkane side-product is ethane, then it falls to ca. 16 to 19%. 
91 
On Zn-ZSM-5 part of the hydrogen atom pool lost on aromatization is re- 
leased as dihydrogen [ 111 and an improved BTX selectivity results. It appears 
[ 121 that Ga-ZSM-5 or GaZn-ZSM-5 catalysts operate in a similar manner, 
but gallium-containing samples are preferred since zinc volatilization occurs 
at the reaction temperatures used for samples containing zinc alone. The con- 
tact time has been shown to have a strong influence on the product distribution 
obtained in these systems [ 10,131. To summarize, the observed selectivity to 
aromatics depends on the form of the zeolite used and on the contact time. The 
object of the work described here was to examine these effects more system- 
atically and, in addition, to compare the aromatization behaviour of the three 
light alkanes: propane, n-butane and i-butane. 
EXPERIMENTAL 
ZSM-5 zeolites (silicon: aluminium ratio = 19) were prepared as described 
previously [ 141, and were characterized using X-ray diffractometry. The syn- 
thesized materials were converted into the NH,+ form by exchange with am- 
monium chloride solutions. The H+ form was obtained by calcining at 550C. 
Zinc or gallium was introduced by treating the H-ZSM-5 with aqueous solu- 
tions of the respective metal nitrate. The final zinc or gallium contents of the 
catalysts were typically up to ca. 1.0 mass-%. All solids were crushed and sized 
before use. 
Reactions were carried out using a flow microreactor which contained ca. 
0.4 g catalyst. The reactant was passed at a suitable space velocity (mass hourly 
space velocity, MHSV, in the range ca. 0.3 to 21 h-l) at atmospheric pressure. 
The reaction temperature was normally 490 to 500 C. The products were an- 
alysed by sampling the exit stream at suitable intervals using a gas-sampling 
valve and a gas-liquid chromatograph. Aliphatic and aromatic components up 
to ca. C,, were determined using an alumina column with temperature pro- 
gramming and flame-ionization detection. 
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 
Effect of metal component on BTXselectivity 
It was found that the incorporation of zinc or gallium into H-ZSM-5 had a 
similar beneficial effect on the selectivity to BTX from propane (Fig. 2 ) 
. 
The 
selectivities depicted in Fig. 2 reflect infinite space velocity (zero conversion) 
conditions in order to eliminate the effect of the conversion level on selectivity. 
Actually, the latter effect does not present a serious problem in the sense that 
the overall activities of the various catalysts do not differ to any great extent. 
The infinite space velocity selectivity is, however, considered to be preferable 
when attempting to compare the behaviour of a series of catalysts in that it
