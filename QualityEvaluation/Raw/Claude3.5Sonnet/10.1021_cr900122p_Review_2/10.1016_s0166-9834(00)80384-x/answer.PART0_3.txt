[1] "It has been found that, when propane is used as the reactant at 5OOC and 0.1 MPa, the BTX selectivity can be increased from ca. 10% (H-ZSM-5) to ca. 40 to 45% after treatment of the base zeolite with solutions of zinc or gallium nitrate, such that the final zinc or gallium content is ca. 1.0 mass-%."

[2] "A comparative study of the conversion of propane, n-butane and i-butane over Zn-ZSM-5 reveals that the alkanes differ in terms of activity and BTX selectivity. i-Butane is the most reactive of the three alkanes and also yields the highest percentage hydrogen recovery as dihydrogen. However, it displays the lowest BTX selectivity."

[3] "On Zn-ZSM-5 part of the hydrogen atom pool lost on aromatization is released as dihydrogen and an improved BTX selectivity results. It appears that Ga-ZSM-5 or GaZn-ZSM-5 catalysts operate in a similar manner, but gallium-containing samples are preferred since zinc volatilization occurs at the reaction temperatures used for samples containing zinc alone."

[4] "The contact time has been shown to have a strong influence on the product distribution obtained in these systems. To summarize, the observed selectivity to aromatics depends on the form of the zeolite used and on the contact time."

The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations, particularly in zeolite-catalyzed reactions. Key factors include:

1. Metal content: Adding zinc or gallium (around 1.0 mass-%) to H-ZSM-5 zeolites increases BTX selectivity from about 10% to 40-45% for propane conversion at 500°C and 0.1 MPa.

2. Catalyst type: Zn-ZSM-5 and Ga-ZSM-5 catalysts show improved BTX selectivity compared to H-ZSM-5. Gallium-containing catalysts are preferred due to zinc volatilization at high temperatures.

3. Reactant alkane: Different alkanes (propane, n-butane, i-butane) show varying activities and BTX selectivities over Zn-ZSM-5. i-Butane is the most reactive but has the lowest BTX selectivity.

4. Reaction mechanism: On Zn-ZSM-5, part of the hydrogen lost during aromatization is released as dihydrogen, improving BTX selectivity.

5. Contact time: This strongly influences product distribution in these systems.

These factors contribute to the industrial significance of these catalysts by allowing for tunable selectivity and improved yields of desired aromatic products from light alkanes.

金属基催化剂的组成、结构和反应条件显著影响烷烃转化的机理和效率，尤其是在沸石催化反应中。主要因素包括：

1. 金属含量：在H-ZSM-5沸石中添加锌或镓（约1.0质量百分比）可以将丙烷转化的BTX选择性从约10%提高到40-45%（在500°C和0.1 MPa条件下）。

2. 催化剂类型：与H-ZSM-5相比，Zn-ZSM-5和Ga-ZSM-5催化剂表现出更高的BTX选择性。由于锌在高温下易挥发，含镓催化剂更受青睐。

3. 反应物烷烃：不同的烷烃（丙烷、正丁烷、异丁烷）在Zn-ZSM-5上表现出不同的活性和BTX选择性。异丁烷反应性最强，但BTX选择性最低。

4. 反应机理：在Zn-ZSM-5上，芳构化过程中损失的部分氢以氢气形式释放，从而提高BTX选择性。

5. 接触时间：这对这些体系中的产物分布有很强的影响。

这些因素通过允许可调节的选择性和从轻烷烃中获得所需芳香族产物的改进产率，促进了这些催化剂的工业重要性。
