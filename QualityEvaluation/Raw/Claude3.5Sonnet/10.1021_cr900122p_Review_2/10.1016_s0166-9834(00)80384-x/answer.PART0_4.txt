[1] "It has been found that, when propane is used as the reactant at 5OOC and 0.1 MPa, the BTX selectivity can be increased from ca. 10% (H-ZSM-5) to ca. 40 to 45% after treatment of the base zeolite with solutions of zinc or gallium nitrate, such that the final zinc or gallium content is ca. 1.0 mass-%."

[2] "On Zn-ZSM-5 part of the hydrogen atom pool lost on aromatization is released as dihydrogen [11] and an improved BTX selectivity results. It appears [12] that Ga-ZSM-5 or GaZn-ZSM-5 catalysts operate in a similar manner, but gallium-containing samples are preferred since zinc volatilization occurs at the reaction temperatures used for samples containing zinc alone."

[3] "The contact time has been shown to have a strong influence on the product distribution obtained in these systems [10,13]. To summarize, the observed selectivity to aromatics depends on the form of the zeolite used and on the contact time."

The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations in processes like zeolite-catalyzed reactions. 

For ZSM-5 catalysts, the incorporation of metals like zinc or gallium can greatly improve the selectivity towards BTX (benzene, toluene, and xylenes) products. The addition of about 1.0 mass-% of zinc or gallium can increase BTX selectivity from around 10% for H-ZSM-5 to 40-45% at 500°C and 0.1 MPa when using propane as a reactant.

The mechanism of improved selectivity involves the release of hydrogen as dihydrogen rather than its transfer to form light alkanes. This is observed in both Zn-ZSM-5 and Ga-ZSM-5 catalysts. However, gallium-containing catalysts are preferred due to zinc volatilization at high reaction temperatures.

Reaction conditions, particularly contact time, strongly influence the product distribution. The overall selectivity to aromatics depends on both the form of the zeolite used (e.g., H-ZSM-5, Zn-ZSM-5, or Ga-ZSM-5) and the contact time.

These factors contribute to the industrial significance of these catalysts by allowing for improved yields of valuable aromatic products from light alkanes, which is an important process for upgrading lower-value hydrocarbons.

金属基催化剂的组成、结构和反应条件显著影响烷烃转化过程中的机理和效率，特别是在沸石催化反应等过程中。

对于ZSM-5催化剂，掺入锌或镓等金属可以大大提高对BTX（苯、甲苯和二甲苯）产物的选择性。在500°C和0.1 MPa的条件下，使用丙烷作为反应物时，添加约1.0质量百分比的锌或镓可以将BTX选择性从H-ZSM-5的约10%提高到40-45%。

选择性提高的机理涉及氢以氢气形式释放，而不是转移形成轻烷烃。这在Zn-ZSM-5和Ga-ZSM-5催化剂中都有观察到。然而，由于锌在高反应温度下容易挥发，含镓催化剂更受青睐。

反应条件，特别是接触时间，强烈影响产物分布。芳烃的总体选择性取决于所使用的沸石形式（如H-ZSM-5、Zn-ZSM-5或Ga-ZSM-5）和接触时间。

这些因素通过允许从轻烷烃获得更高产率的有价值芳烃产品，为这些催化剂的工业重要性做出了贡献，这是提升低价值烃类的重要过程。
