[1] "The conversion of light alkanes such as propane and butane to aromatics is not completely selective. Light alkenes, the probable reaction intermediates, are formed in addition to the BTX components."

[2] "On H-ZSM-5, all of the hydrogen atoms lost on aromatization of the reactant alkane appear in the product as light alkanes."

[3] "On Zn-ZSM-5 part of the hydrogen atom pool lost on aromatization is released as dihydrogen and an improved BTX selectivity results."

[4] "It appears that Ga-ZSM-5 or GaZn-ZSM-5 catalysts operate in a similar manner, but gallium-containing samples are preferred since zinc volatilization occurs at the reaction temperatures used for samples containing zinc alone."

[5] "The incorporation of zinc or gallium into H-ZSM-5 had a similar beneficial effect on the selectivity to BTX from propane"

The composition and structure of metal-based catalysts significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations, particularly in zeolite-catalyzed reactions. The literature discusses ZSM-5 zeolites modified with metals like zinc and gallium.

For H-ZSM-5, the hydrogen atoms lost during aromatization appear as light alkanes in the product, limiting BTX selectivity. However, incorporating metals like zinc or gallium into the ZSM-5 structure improves BTX selectivity. On Zn-ZSM-5, some of the hydrogen is released as dihydrogen, leading to improved BTX selectivity. Ga-ZSM-5 and GaZn-ZSM-5 catalysts operate similarly, but gallium-containing samples are preferred due to zinc volatilization at high reaction temperatures.

The reaction conditions, such as temperature, also play a role in catalyst performance. For instance, gallium-containing catalysts are preferred at higher temperatures due to zinc volatilization issues.

These factors contribute to the industrial significance of these catalysts by improving the selectivity towards desired aromatic products (BTX) in alkane transformation processes. The ability to tune catalyst composition and structure allows for optimized performance in industrial applications.

金属基催化剂的组成和结构对烷烃转化的机理和效率有显著影响，特别是在沸石催化反应中。文献讨论了经金属如锌和镓改性的ZSM-5沸石。

对于H-ZSM-5，芳构化过程中失去的氢原子在产物中以轻烷烃的形式出现，限制了BTX选择性。然而，将锌或镓等金属引入ZSM-5结构可以提高BTX选择性。在Zn-ZSM-5上，部分氢以氢气形式释放，导致BTX选择性提高。Ga-ZSM-5和GaZn-ZSM-5催化剂的作用机制类似，但由于在高反应温度下锌会挥发，因此更倾向于使用含镓的样品。

反应条件，如温度，也影响催化剂性能。例如，由于锌在高温下易挥发，在高温条件下更倾向于使用含镓的催化剂。

这些因素通过提高烷烃转化过程中目标芳烃产物（BTX）的选择性，增加了这些催化剂的工业重要性。能够调整催化剂组成和结构允许在工业应用中优化性能。
