[1] "For supported metal oxides, it has been observed empirically that the decline in olefin selectivity with increasing alkane conversion decreases with increasing basicity of the support."

[2] "Figure 5 shows that the effects of the phosphorus/vanadium ratio on the selectivity of maleic anhydride formation via butane oxidation over supported vanadium phosphate catalysts."

[3] "The selectivity to maleic anhydride increases monotonically with increasing P/V (phosphorus/vanadium) ratio. Near-edge analysis of X-ray absorption spectra taken during butane oxidation suggest that the high selectivity to maleic anhydride observed when P/V = 2 is associated with the stabilization of a high proportion of the V in the 4+ oxidation state."

[4] "Cu/ZSM-5, where ZSM-5 is a type of zeolite with an MFI structure. Its activity is suppressed significantly by water vapor, which is present at 10% in engine exhaust. Fe/ZSM-5 is also very active and selective, and its activity remains high in the presence of water vapor"

[5] "For these catalysts, heating above the normal operating temperature must be prevented by proper engineering because of the low zeolite hydrothermal stability at high temperatures. In addition, the operating temperature window of these catalysts is rather narrow, and their efficiency depends on the nature of the hydrocarbon reductant. They are also sensitive to sulfur poisoning."

The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations:

1. For supported metal oxides, the basicity of the support affects olefin selectivity. As the support becomes more basic, the decline in olefin selectivity with increasing alkane conversion decreases.

2. In vanadium phosphate catalysts, the phosphorus/vanadium (P/V) ratio plays a crucial role. The selectivity for maleic anhydride formation increases as the P/V ratio increases. This is linked to the stabilization of V in the 4+ oxidation state when P/V = 2.

3. For zeolite catalysts like Cu/ZSM-5 and Fe/ZSM-5, water vapor in the reaction environment affects their performance. While Cu/ZSM-5's activity is significantly suppressed by water vapor, Fe/ZSM-5 maintains high activity and selectivity even in its presence.

4. Zeolite catalysts have specific operating constraints. They have low hydrothermal stability at high temperatures, narrow operating temperature windows, and their efficiency depends on the nature of the hydrocarbon reductant. They are also sensitive to sulfur poisoning.

These factors contribute to the industrial significance of these catalysts by affecting their selectivity, stability, and overall performance in alkane transformation processes. The ability to tune catalyst properties through composition and structure allows for optimization of industrial processes. However, challenges such as sensitivity to reaction conditions and poisoning need to be addressed for wider industrial application.

金属基催化剂的组成、结构和反应条件显著影响烷烃转化的机理和效率：

1. 对于负载型金属氧化物，载体的碱性影响烯烃选择性。随着载体碱性增强，烯烃选择性随烷烃转化率增加而下降的趋势减弱。

2. 在钒磷酸盐催化剂中，磷/钒(P/V)比起着关键作用。随着P/V比的增加，马来酸酐的生成选择性增加。这与P/V=2时V4+氧化态的稳定化有关。

3. 对于Cu/ZSM-5和Fe/ZSM-5等沸石催化剂，反应环境中的水蒸气影响其性能。Cu/ZSM-5的活性受水蒸气显著抑制，而Fe/ZSM-5即使在水蒸气存在下仍保持高活性和选择性。

4. 沸石催化剂有特定的操作限制。它们在高温下水热稳定性低，操作温度窗口窄，效率取决于烃类还原剂的性质。它们也对硫中毒敏感。

这些因素通过影响催化剂在烷烃转化过程中的选择性、稳定性和整体性能，对这些催化剂的工业重要性产生影响。通过组成和结构调整催化剂性能的能力允许优化工业过程。然而，对反应条件敏感和中毒等挑战需要解决，以实现更广泛的工业应用。

[1] "Figure 5 shows that while the value of k1 increases with increasing domain size, the ratio of k2/k1 decreases and the ratio of k3/k1 is independent of domain size. These results indicate that ODH requires large vanadia domains."

[2] "Zeolite-based catalysts for NOx reduction have been shown typically to exhibit high activity and selectivity over a temperature window of about 150 C at temperatures above 350 C. The most active catalyst in the class is Cu/ZSM-5, where ZSM-5 is a type of zeolite with an MFI structure."

[3] "There are M/ZSM-5 active site models formulated on the basis of spectroscopic information. For example, a dimeric FeOFe cluster has been proposed for Fe/ZSM-5 catalysts. However, most of the information has been acquired ex situ; there is very little information available under actual reaction conditions."

[4] "Alumina-based NOx reduction catalysts have been shown to exhibit high activity and selectivity at temperatures above 425 C. At high temperatures, their activities are higher than zeolite-based catalysts (e.g., Figure 20 for a SnO2/Al2O3 catalyst); however, they also have a relatively narrow operating temperature window of about 150 C."

The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations:

For supported vanadium oxide catalysts, the domain size of vanadia affects the rates of different reaction pathways in oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH). Larger vanadia domains are required for ODH reactions, but they also promote undesired side reactions.

For metal-exchanged zeolites like Cu/ZSM-5, the catalyst structure (MFI framework) and metal type (e.g. Cu) determine the activity and selectivity. These catalysts show high performance for NOx reduction in a specific temperature range (above 350°C).

The active sites in zeolite catalysts, such as the proposed FeOFe clusters in Fe/ZSM-5, play a crucial role but are not well understood under real reaction conditions. This limits our ability to optimize these catalysts.

Alumina-based catalysts show higher activities than zeolites at temperatures above 425°C for NOx reduction, but also have a narrow optimal temperature window. The support material (alumina) and metal oxide (e.g. SnO2) composition affect the catalytic properties.

The industrial significance of these catalysts stems from their high activities and selectivities in important processes like alkane ODH and NOx reduction. However, their narrow operating windows and lack of understanding of active sites under reaction conditions remain challenges for wider industrial application. Further in-situ studies and catalyst design are needed to overcome these limitations.

金属基催化剂的组成、结构和反应条件显著影响烷烃转化的机理和效率：

对于负载型钒氧化物催化剂，钒氧化物的尺寸影响氧化脱氢(ODH)反应中不同反应途径的速率。ODH反应需要较大的钒氧化物域，但这也促进了不必要的副反应。

对于Cu/ZSM-5等金属交换沸石，催化剂结构(MFI骨架)和金属类型(如Cu)决定了活性和选择性。这些催化剂在特定温度范围(350°C以上)对NOx还原表现出高性能。

沸石催化剂中的活性位点，如Fe/ZSM-5中提出的FeOFe簇，起着至关重要的作用，但在实际反应条件下尚未得到充分了解。这限制了我们优化这些催化剂的能力。

氧化铝基催化剂在425°C以上温度下对NOx还原表现出比沸石更高的活性，但也有狭窄的最佳温度窗口。载体材料(氧化铝)和金属氧化物(如SnO2)的组成影响催化性能。

这些催化剂的工业重要性源于它们在烷烃ODH和NOx还原等重要过程中的高活性和选择性。然而，它们狭窄的操作窗口和对反应条件下活性位点缺乏了解仍然是更广泛工业应用的挑战。需要进一步的原位研究和催化剂设计来克服这些限制。

[1] "A series of catalysts ranging in V2O5 weight loading from 1% to 15% were prepared and then characterized by X-ray absorption, Raman spectroscopy, UVvisible absorption spectroscopy, and EXAFS."

[2] "Values of the rate coefficients for eqs 911 were determined and examined as a function of vanadia domain size, which correlates with the UVvisible absorption band edge energy. As seen in Figure 5, while the value of k1 increases with increasing domain size, the ratio of k2/k1 decreases and the ratio of k3/k1 is independent of domain size."

[3] "These results indicate that ODH requires large vanadia domains. Propene combustion also occurs preferentially on large polyvanadate domains, but propane combustion occurs preferentially on smaller domains."

[4] "Figure 6 shows that the effects of the phosphorus/vanadium ratio on the selectivity of maleic anhydride formation via butane oxidation over supported vanadium phosphate catalysts. The selectivity to maleic anhydride increases monotonically with increasing P/V (phosphorus/vanadium) ratio."

The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations. For supported vanadium oxide catalysts, the vanadia domain size plays a crucial role in determining catalytic performance. Larger vanadia domains are required for oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH), while propene combustion occurs preferentially on large polyvanadate domains. Interestingly, propane combustion is favored on smaller domains. 

The phosphorus to vanadium ratio in supported vanadium phosphate catalysts affects the selectivity for maleic anhydride formation during butane oxidation. As the P/V ratio increases, the selectivity for maleic anhydride increases monotonically, indicating the importance of catalyst composition in controlling product selectivity.

For zeolite-based catalysts, the type of metal exchanged into the zeolite framework significantly impacts catalytic performance. Cu/ZSM-5 shows high activity but is sensitive to water vapor, which is problematic for industrial applications where water is often present. In contrast, Fe/ZSM-5 maintains high activity and selectivity even in the presence of water vapor, making it more suitable for real-world conditions.

The industrial significance of these catalysts is largely determined by their ability to maintain high activity and selectivity under relevant reaction conditions. Factors such as water tolerance, domain size control, and compositional tuning (e.g., P/V ratio) contribute to the potential industrial applicability of these catalytic systems for alkane transformations.

金属基催化剂的成分、结构和反应条件对烷烃转化的机理和效率有显著影响。对于负载型钒氧化物催化剂，钒氧化物的域大小在决定催化性能方面起着关键作用。氧化脱氢(ODH)需要较大的钒氧化物域，而丙烯的燃烧主要发生在大的多钒酸盐域上。有趣的是，丙烷的燃烧更倾向于在较小的域上进行。

在负载型钒磷酸盐催化剂中，磷与钒的比例影响丁烷氧化生成顺丁烯二酸酐的选择性。随着P/V比的增加，顺丁烯二酸酐的选择性单调增加，这表明催化剂组成对控制产物选择性非常重要。

对于沸石基催化剂，交换到沸石骨架中的金属类型对催化性能有显著影响。Cu/ZSM-5表现出高活性，但对水蒸气敏感，这在水经常存在的工业应用中是个问题。相比之下，Fe/ZSM-5即使在存在水蒸气的情况下也保持高活性和选择性，使其更适合实际条件。

这些催化剂的工业重要性主要取决于它们在相关反应条件下保持高活性和选择性的能力。诸如耐水性、域大小控制和组成调整（如P/V比）等因素都影响着这些催化体系在烷烃转化中的潜在工业应用。

For supported vanadium oxide catalysts, the basicity of the support affects olefin selectivity during oxidative dehydrogenation. The phosphorus to vanadium ratio impacts the selectivity for maleic anhydride formation in butane oxidation.

For zeolite-based catalysts, the metal exchanged into the zeolite framework plays a crucial role. Cu/ZSM-5 is highly active but sensitive to water vapor, while Fe/ZSM-5 maintains high activity even in the presence of water. The active sites in these catalysts are believed to involve metal clusters, such as dimeric FeOFe structures in Fe/ZSM-5.

Reaction conditions, particularly the presence of water vapor, can significantly affect catalyst performance. Hydrothermal conditions can lead to catalyst degradation through dealumination of the zeolite and migration of metal species.

The industrial significance of these catalysts stems from their ability to efficiently convert alkanes to more valuable products. However, their performance is highly dependent on maintaining the desired structure and composition under reaction conditions. Factors like water tolerance, resistance to dealumination, and stability of metal sites contribute to their practical applicability in industrial processes.

For supported vanadium oxides, the size of vanadia domains affects the catalytic activity and selectivity in oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) reactions. Larger vanadia domains are required for ODH, but they also promote propene combustion. Smaller domains preferentially catalyze propane combustion.

For metal-exchanged zeolites, the type of metal and zeolite structure play crucial roles. Cu/ZSM-5 is highly active but sensitive to water vapor, while Fe/ZSM-5 maintains high activity and selectivity even in the presence of water. The efficiency of these catalysts depends on the nature of the hydrocarbon reductant and is affected by factors such as temperature and sulfur content.

The industrial significance of these catalysts is impacted by several factors:

1. Hydrothermal stability: Zeolites have low hydrothermal stability at high temperatures, requiring careful temperature control.

2. Narrow operating temperature window: This limits the range of conditions under which the catalysts can effectively operate.

3. Sensitivity to sulfur poisoning: This can reduce catalyst lifetime and efficiency in industrial settings where sulfur-containing compounds may be present.

4. Deactivation mechanisms: Dealumination of zeolites and metal ion migration/agglomeration contribute to catalyst deactivation, though the detailed steps and kinetics of these processes are not fully understood.

To improve the industrial applicability of these catalysts, further research is needed to elucidate the precise mechanisms of deactivation and their dependence on metal ions, zeolite structure, and composition. This understanding could lead to the development of more stable and efficient catalysts for alkane transformations.

这些催化剂的工业重要性受到几个因素的影响：

1. 水热稳定性：沸石在高温下的水热稳定性较低，需要仔细控制温度。

2. 狭窄的操作温度窗口：这限制了催化剂能够有效工作的条件范围。

3. 对硫中毒的敏感性：在含硫化合物可能存在的工业环境中，这可能会降低催化剂的寿命和效率。

4. 失活机制：沸石的脱铝和金属离子的迁移/聚集导致催化剂失活，尽管这些过程的详细步骤和动力学尚未完全了解。

为了提高这些催化剂的工业适用性，需要进一步研究以阐明失活的精确机制及其与金属离子、沸石结构和组成的关系。这种理解可能导致开发出更稳定和更高效的烷烃转化催化剂。
