[1] "For supported metal oxides, it has been observed empirically that the decline in olefin selectivity with increasing alkane conversion decreases with increasing basicity of the support."

[2] "Figure 5 shows that the effects of the phosphorus/vanadium ratio on the selectivity of maleic anhydride formation via butane oxidation over supported vanadium phosphate catalysts."

[3] "The most active catalyst in the class is Cu/ZSM-5, where ZSM-5 is a type of zeolite with an MFI structure. Its activity is suppressed significantly by water vapor, which is present at 10% in engine exhaust. Fe/ZSM-5 is also very active and selective, and its activity remains high in the presence of water vapor (Figure 19)."

[4] "There are M/ZSM-5 active site models formulated on the basis of spectroscopic information. For example, a dimeric FeOFe cluster has been proposed for Fe/ZSM-5 catalysts."

[5] "It is known that hydrothermal degradation of catalysts is associated with dealumination of the zeolite and migration and agglomeration of the metal ions and oxo complexes."

The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations. For supported vanadium oxide catalysts, the basicity of the support affects olefin selectivity during oxidative dehydrogenation. The phosphorus to vanadium ratio impacts the selectivity for maleic anhydride formation in butane oxidation.

For zeolite-based catalysts, the metal exchanged into the zeolite framework plays a crucial role. Cu/ZSM-5 is highly active but sensitive to water vapor, while Fe/ZSM-5 maintains high activity even in the presence of water. The active sites in these catalysts are believed to involve metal clusters, such as dimeric FeOFe structures in Fe/ZSM-5.

Reaction conditions, particularly the presence of water vapor, can significantly affect catalyst performance. Hydrothermal conditions can lead to catalyst degradation through dealumination of the zeolite and migration of metal species.

The industrial significance of these catalysts stems from their ability to efficiently convert alkanes to more valuable products. However, their performance is highly dependent on maintaining the desired structure and composition under reaction conditions. Factors like water tolerance, resistance to dealumination, and stability of metal sites contribute to their practical applicability in industrial processes.

金属基催化剂的组成、结构和反应条件显著影响烷烃转化的机理和效率。对于负载型钒氧化物催化剂，载体的碱性影响氧化脱氢过程中烯烃的选择性。磷与钒的比例影响丁烷氧化生成马来酸酐的选择性。

对于沸石基催化剂，交换到沸石骨架中的金属起着关键作用。Cu/ZSM-5具有高活性但对水蒸气敏感，而Fe/ZSM-5即使在存在水蒸气的情况下也保持高活性。这些催化剂中的活性位点被认为涉及金属簇，如Fe/ZSM-5中的二聚FeOFe结构。

反应条件，特别是水蒸气的存在，可以显著影响催化剂性能。水热条件可能导致催化剂通过沸石脱铝和金属物种迁移而降解。

这些催化剂的工业重要性源于它们能够有效地将烷烃转化为更有价值的产品。然而，它们的性能高度依赖于在反应条件下保持所需的结构和组成。像耐水性、抗脱铝性和金属位点的稳定性等因素都影响着它们在工业过程中的实际应用。
