          [1] "For supported metal oxides, it has been observed empirically that the decline in olefin selectivity with increasing alkane conversion decreases with increasing basicity of the support."

[2] "Figure 5 shows that the effects of the phosphorus/vanadium ratio on the selectivity of maleic anhydride formation via butane oxidation over supported vanadium phosphate catalysts."

[3] "The selectivity to maleic anhydride increases monotonically with increasing P/V (phosphorus/vanadium) ratio. Near-edge analysis of X-ray absorption spectra taken during butane oxidation suggest that the high selectivity to maleic anhydride observed when P/V = 2 is associated with the stabilization of a high proportion of the V in the 4+ oxidation state."

[4] "Figure 5 shows that while the value of k1 increases with increasing domain size, the ratio of k2/k1 decreases and the ratio of k3/k1 is independent of domain size. These results indicate that ODH requires large vanadia domains."

[5] "Cu/ZSM-5, where ZSM-5 is a type of zeolite with an MFI structure. Its activity is suppressed significantly by water vapor, which is present at 10% in engine exhaust. Fe/ZSM-5 is also very active and selective, and its activity remains high in the presence of water vapor"

[6] "For these catalysts, heating above the normal operating temperature must be prevented by proper engineering because of the low zeolite hydrothermal stability at high temperatures. In addition, the operating temperature window of these catalysts is rather narrow, and their efficiency depends on the nature of the hydrocarbon reductant. They are also sensitive to sulfur poisoning."

[7] "It is known that hydrothermal degradation of catalysts is associated with dealumination of the zeolite and migration and agglomeration of the metal ions and oxo complexes."

          The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations:

1. For supported metal oxides, the basicity of the support affects olefin selectivity. As the support becomes more basic, the decline in olefin selectivity with increasing alkane conversion decreases.

2. In vanadium phosphate catalysts, the phosphorus/vanadium (P/V) ratio plays a crucial role. The selectivity for maleic anhydride formation increases as the P/V ratio increases. This is linked to the stabilization of V in the 4+ oxidation state when P/V = 2.

3. For supported vanadium oxide catalysts, the domain size of vanadia affects the rates of different reaction pathways in oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH). Larger vanadia domains are required for ODH reactions.

4. For zeolite catalysts like Cu/ZSM-5 and Fe/ZSM-5, water vapor in the reaction environment affects their performance. While Cu/ZSM-5's activity is significantly suppressed by water vapor, Fe/ZSM-5 maintains high activity and selectivity even in its presence.

5. Zeolite catalysts have specific operating constraints. They have low hydrothermal stability at high temperatures, narrow operating temperature windows, and their efficiency depends on the nature of the hydrocarbon reductant. They are also sensitive to sulfur poisoning.

6. Hydrothermal degradation of zeolite catalysts is associated with dealumination and migration/agglomeration of metal ions and oxo complexes.

These factors contribute to the industrial significance of these catalysts by affecting their selectivity, stability, and overall performance in alkane transformation processes. The ability to tune catalyst properties through composition and structure allows for optimization of industrial processes. However, challenges such as sensitivity to reaction conditions and poisoning need to be addressed for wider industrial application.

          金属基催化剂的组成、结构和反应条件显著影响烷烃转化的机理和效率：

1. 对于负载型金属氧化物，载体的碱性影响烯烃选择性。随着载体碱性增强，烯烃选择性随烷烃转化率增加而下降的趋势减弱。

2. 在钒磷酸盐催化剂中，磷/钒(P/V)比起着关键作用。随着P/V比的增加，马来酸酐的生成选择性增加。这与P/V=2时V4+氧化态的稳定化有关。

3. 对于负载型钒氧化物催化剂，钒氧化物的结构域大小影响氧化脱氢(ODH)反应中不同反应途径的速率。ODH反应需要较大的钒氧化物域。

4. 对于Cu/ZSM-5和Fe/ZSM-5等沸石催化剂，反应环境中的水蒸气影响其性能。Cu/ZSM-5的活性受水蒸气显著抑制，而Fe/ZSM-5即使在水蒸气存在下仍保持高活性和选择性。

5. 沸石催化剂有特定的操作限制。它们在高温下水热稳定性低，操作温度窗口窄，效率取决于烃类还原剂的性质。它们也对硫中毒敏感。

6. 沸石催化剂的水热降解与脱铝和金属离子及氧化物复合物的迁移/聚集有关。

这些因素通过影响催化剂在烷烃转化过程中的选择性、稳定性和整体性能，对这些催化剂的工业重要性产生影响。通过组成和结构调整催化剂性能的能力允许优化工业过程。然而，对反应条件敏感和中毒等挑战需要解决，以实现更广泛的工业应用。
