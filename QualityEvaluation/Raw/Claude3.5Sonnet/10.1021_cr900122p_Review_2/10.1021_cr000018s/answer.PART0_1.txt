[1] "Figure 5 shows that while the value of k1 increases with increasing domain size, the ratio of k2/k1 decreases and the ratio of k3/k1 is independent of domain size. These results indicate that ODH requires large vanadia domains."

[2] "Zeolite-based catalysts for NOx reduction have been shown typically to exhibit high activity and selectivity over a temperature window of about 150 C at temperatures above 350 C. The most active catalyst in the class is Cu/ZSM-5, where ZSM-5 is a type of zeolite with an MFI structure."

[3] "There are M/ZSM-5 active site models formulated on the basis of spectroscopic information. For example, a dimeric FeOFe cluster has been proposed for Fe/ZSM-5 catalysts. However, most of the information has been acquired ex situ; there is very little information available under actual reaction conditions."

[4] "Alumina-based NOx reduction catalysts have been shown to exhibit high activity and selectivity at temperatures above 425 C. At high temperatures, their activities are higher than zeolite-based catalysts (e.g., Figure 20 for a SnO2/Al2O3 catalyst); however, they also have a relatively narrow operating temperature window of about 150 C."

The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations:

For supported vanadium oxide catalysts, the domain size of vanadia affects the rates of different reaction pathways in oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH). Larger vanadia domains are required for ODH reactions, but they also promote undesired side reactions.

For metal-exchanged zeolites like Cu/ZSM-5, the catalyst structure (MFI framework) and metal type (e.g. Cu) determine the activity and selectivity. These catalysts show high performance for NOx reduction in a specific temperature range (above 350°C).

The active sites in zeolite catalysts, such as the proposed FeOFe clusters in Fe/ZSM-5, play a crucial role but are not well understood under real reaction conditions. This limits our ability to optimize these catalysts.

Alumina-based catalysts show higher activities than zeolites at temperatures above 425°C for NOx reduction, but also have a narrow optimal temperature window. The support material (alumina) and metal oxide (e.g. SnO2) composition affect the catalytic properties.

The industrial significance of these catalysts stems from their high activities and selectivities in important processes like alkane ODH and NOx reduction. However, their narrow operating windows and lack of understanding of active sites under reaction conditions remain challenges for wider industrial application. Further in-situ studies and catalyst design are needed to overcome these limitations.

金属基催化剂的组成、结构和反应条件显著影响烷烃转化的机理和效率：

对于负载型钒氧化物催化剂，钒氧化物的尺寸影响氧化脱氢(ODH)反应中不同反应途径的速率。ODH反应需要较大的钒氧化物域，但这也促进了不必要的副反应。

对于Cu/ZSM-5等金属交换沸石，催化剂结构(MFI骨架)和金属类型(如Cu)决定了活性和选择性。这些催化剂在特定温度范围(350°C以上)对NOx还原表现出高性能。

沸石催化剂中的活性位点，如Fe/ZSM-5中提出的FeOFe簇，起着至关重要的作用，但在实际反应条件下尚未得到充分了解。这限制了我们优化这些催化剂的能力。

氧化铝基催化剂在425°C以上温度下对NOx还原表现出比沸石更高的活性，但也有狭窄的最佳温度窗口。载体材料(氧化铝)和金属氧化物(如SnO2)的组成影响催化性能。

这些催化剂的工业重要性源于它们在烷烃ODH和NOx还原等重要过程中的高活性和选择性。然而，它们狭窄的操作窗口和对反应条件下活性位点缺乏了解仍然是更广泛工业应用的挑战。需要进一步的原位研究和催化剂设计来克服这些限制。
