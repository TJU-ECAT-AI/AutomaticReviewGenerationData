[1] "Figure 5 shows that while the value of k1 increases with increasing domain size, the ratio of k2/k1 decreases and the ratio of k3/k1 is independent of domain size. These results indicate that ODH requires large vanadia domains. Propene combustion also occurs preferentially on large polyvanadate domains, but propane combustion occurs preferentially on smaller domains."

[2] "The most active catalyst in the class is Cu/ZSM-5, where ZSM-5 is a type of zeolite with an MFI structure. Its activity is suppressed significantly by water vapor, which is present at 10% in engine exhaust. Fe/ZSM-5 is also very active and selective, and its activity remains high in the presence of water vapor (Figure 19)."

[3] "For these catalysts, heating above the normal operating temperature must be prevented by proper engineering because of the low zeolite hydrothermal stability at high temperatures. In addition, the operating temperature window of these catalysts is rather narrow, and their efficiency depends on the nature of the hydrocarbon reductant. They are also sensitive to sulfur poisoning."

[4] "It is known that hydrothermal degradation of catalysts is associated with dealumination of the zeolite and migration and agglomeration of the metal ions and oxo complexes. However, the detailed mechanistic steps associated with deactivation, the kinetics of these steps, and their dependence on the metal ions as well as the zeolite structure and composition remain to be investigated."

The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations. For supported vanadium oxides, the size of vanadia domains affects the catalytic activity and selectivity in oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) reactions. Larger vanadia domains are required for ODH, but they also promote propene combustion. Smaller domains preferentially catalyze propane combustion.

For metal-exchanged zeolites, the type of metal and zeolite structure play crucial roles. Cu/ZSM-5 is highly active but sensitive to water vapor, while Fe/ZSM-5 maintains high activity and selectivity even in the presence of water. The efficiency of these catalysts depends on the nature of the hydrocarbon reductant and is affected by factors such as temperature and sulfur content.

The industrial significance of these catalysts is impacted by several factors:

1. Hydrothermal stability: Zeolites have low hydrothermal stability at high temperatures, requiring careful temperature control.

2. Narrow operating temperature window: This limits the range of conditions under which the catalysts can effectively operate.

3. Sensitivity to sulfur poisoning: This can reduce catalyst lifetime and efficiency in industrial settings where sulfur-containing compounds may be present.

4. Deactivation mechanisms: Dealumination of zeolites and metal ion migration/agglomeration contribute to catalyst deactivation, though the detailed steps and kinetics of these processes are not fully understood.

To improve the industrial applicability of these catalysts, further research is needed to elucidate the precise mechanisms of deactivation and their dependence on metal ions, zeolite structure, and composition. This understanding could lead to the development of more stable and efficient catalysts for alkane transformations.

金属基催化剂的组成、结构和反应条件显著影响烷烃转化的机理和效率。对于负载型钒氧化物，钒氧化物结构域的大小影响氧化脱氢(ODH)反应的催化活性和选择性。较大的钒氧化物结构域是ODH所需要的，但它们也促进丙烯的燃烧。较小的结构域优先催化丙烷的燃烧。

对于金属交换沸石，金属类型和沸石结构起着关键作用。Cu/ZSM-5具有高活性但对水蒸气敏感，而Fe/ZSM-5即使在有水存在的情况下也保持高活性和选择性。这些催化剂的效率取决于烃类还原剂的性质，并受温度和硫含量等因素的影响。

这些催化剂的工业重要性受到几个因素的影响：

1. 水热稳定性：沸石在高温下的水热稳定性较低，需要仔细控制温度。

2. 狭窄的操作温度窗口：这限制了催化剂能够有效工作的条件范围。

3. 对硫中毒的敏感性：在含硫化合物可能存在的工业环境中，这可能会降低催化剂的寿命和效率。

4. 失活机制：沸石的脱铝和金属离子的迁移/聚集导致催化剂失活，尽管这些过程的详细步骤和动力学尚未完全了解。

为了提高这些催化剂的工业适用性，需要进一步研究以阐明失活的精确机制及其与金属离子、沸石结构和组成的关系。这种理解可能导致开发出更稳定和更高效的烷烃转化催化剂。
