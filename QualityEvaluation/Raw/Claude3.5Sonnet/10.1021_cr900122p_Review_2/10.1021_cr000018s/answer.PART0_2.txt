[1] "A series of catalysts ranging in V2O5 weight loading from 1% to 15% were prepared and then characterized by X-ray absorption, Raman spectroscopy, UVvisible absorption spectroscopy, and EXAFS."

[2] "Values of the rate coefficients for eqs 911 were determined and examined as a function of vanadia domain size, which correlates with the UVvisible absorption band edge energy. As seen in Figure 5, while the value of k1 increases with increasing domain size, the ratio of k2/k1 decreases and the ratio of k3/k1 is independent of domain size."

[3] "These results indicate that ODH requires large vanadia domains. Propene combustion also occurs preferentially on large polyvanadate domains, but propane combustion occurs preferentially on smaller domains."

[4] "Figure 6 shows that the effects of the phosphorus/vanadium ratio on the selectivity of maleic anhydride formation via butane oxidation over supported vanadium phosphate catalysts. The selectivity to maleic anhydride increases monotonically with increasing P/V (phosphorus/vanadium) ratio."

[5] "Cu/ZSM-5, where ZSM-5 is a type of zeolite with an MFI structure. Its activity is suppressed significantly by water vapor, which is present at 10% in engine exhaust. Fe/ZSM-5 is also very active and selective, and its activity remains high in the presence of water vapor"

The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations. For supported vanadium oxide catalysts, the vanadia domain size plays a crucial role in determining catalytic performance. Larger vanadia domains are required for oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH), while propene combustion occurs preferentially on large polyvanadate domains. Interestingly, propane combustion is favored on smaller domains. 

The phosphorus to vanadium ratio in supported vanadium phosphate catalysts affects the selectivity for maleic anhydride formation during butane oxidation. As the P/V ratio increases, the selectivity for maleic anhydride increases monotonically, indicating the importance of catalyst composition in controlling product selectivity.

For zeolite-based catalysts, the type of metal exchanged into the zeolite framework significantly impacts catalytic performance. Cu/ZSM-5 shows high activity but is sensitive to water vapor, which is problematic for industrial applications where water is often present. In contrast, Fe/ZSM-5 maintains high activity and selectivity even in the presence of water vapor, making it more suitable for real-world conditions.

The industrial significance of these catalysts is largely determined by their ability to maintain high activity and selectivity under relevant reaction conditions. Factors such as water tolerance, domain size control, and compositional tuning (e.g., P/V ratio) contribute to the potential industrial applicability of these catalytic systems for alkane transformations.

金属基催化剂的成分、结构和反应条件对烷烃转化的机理和效率有显著影响。对于负载型钒氧化物催化剂，钒氧化物的域大小在决定催化性能方面起着关键作用。氧化脱氢(ODH)需要较大的钒氧化物域，而丙烯的燃烧主要发生在大的多钒酸盐域上。有趣的是，丙烷的燃烧更倾向于在较小的域上进行。

在负载型钒磷酸盐催化剂中，磷与钒的比例影响丁烷氧化生成顺丁烯二酸酐的选择性。随着P/V比的增加，顺丁烯二酸酐的选择性单调增加，这表明催化剂组成对控制产物选择性非常重要。

对于沸石基催化剂，交换到沸石骨架中的金属类型对催化性能有显著影响。Cu/ZSM-5表现出高活性，但对水蒸气敏感，这在水经常存在的工业应用中是个问题。相比之下，Fe/ZSM-5即使在存在水蒸气的情况下也保持高活性和选择性，使其更适合实际条件。

这些催化剂的工业重要性主要取决于它们在相关反应条件下保持高活性和选择性的能力。诸如耐水性、域大小控制和组成调整（如P/V比）等因素都影响着这些催化体系在烷烃转化中的潜在工业应用。
