[1] "Over both ZSM-5-H and ZSM-5-Zn catalysts, ethane reactant was found to be much less reactive than propane: at 870 K the extent of ethane conversion was < 5%."

[2] "The zinc-exchanged (ZSM-5-Zn) and proton-exchanged (ZSM-5-H) forms of ZSM-5 zeolite have been studied for the conversion of propane to aromatic hydrocarbons at temperatures in the range 730-820 K. ZSM-5-Zn was the more active and gave the better BTX selectivity (60-7OC%)."

[3] "With both catalysts, as expected, the propane conversion fell with increasing space velocity but the product distributions behaved differently."

[4] "The apparent activation energies, obtained from Arrhenius plots of the propane conversions, were ZSM-5-Zn (I.28 wt% aluminium), 121+15 kJ mol-'; ZSM-5-Zn (0.71 wt% aluminium), 104+15 kJ mol-'; ZSM-5-H (1.28 wt% aluminium), 120t15 kJ mol-'."

[5] "In the case of the ZSM-5-Zn catalyst, we suggest the zinc cation acts as a hydride acceptor to give a transient species such as [Zn-HI+ (and thence hydrogen)"

The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations. For zeolite-catalyzed reactions, particularly propane conversion:

1. Catalyst composition: ZSM-5-Zn shows higher activity and better BTX selectivity compared to ZSM-5-H, indicating that zinc exchange enhances catalytic performance.

2. Structure: Both ZSM-5-H and ZSM-5-Zn have similar activation energies, suggesting a similar reaction mechanism, but ZSM-5-Zn's improved performance may be due to its ability to act as a hydride acceptor.

3. Reaction conditions: 
   - Temperature: Higher temperatures (730-820 K) favor propane conversion to aromatics.
   - Space velocity: Increasing space velocity decreases propane conversion for both catalysts, but affects product distribution differently.

4. Reactant type: Propane is much more reactive than ethane under similar conditions, highlighting the importance of feedstock selection.

These factors contribute to the industrial significance of zeolite catalysts in alkane transformations by allowing for tuneable product distributions and improved conversion efficiencies. The ability to manipulate catalyst composition and reaction conditions enables the optimization of desired product yields, making these processes more economically viable for industrial applications.

The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations. In this study, zinc-exchanged (ZSM-5-Zn) and proton-exchanged (ZSM-5-H) forms of ZSM-5 zeolite were investigated for propane conversion to aromatic hydrocarbons.

The metal-exchanged zeolite (ZSM-5-Zn) showed higher activity and better BTX (benzene, toluene, xylene) selectivity compared to the proton form (ZSM-5-H). This demonstrates how the composition of the catalyst, specifically the presence of zinc, enhances the catalytic performance.

The reaction mechanism involves propane dehydrogenation, followed by oligomerization and aromatization. However, the primary dehydrogenation step differs mechanistically between the two catalysts. For ZSM-5-H, dehydrogenation is rate-controlled, while for ZSM-5-Zn, it is in quasi-equilibrium. This difference in mechanism is attributed to the presence of zinc in the catalyst structure.

The quasi-equilibrium state in ZSM-5-Zn affects both the conversion rate and BTX selectivity. It is proposed that zinc species, possibly in the form of [Zn-H]+, play a crucial role in controlling these processes. This demonstrates how the metal component in the zeolite structure influences the reaction pathways and product distribution.

The study highlights the importance of catalyst composition and structure in determining reaction mechanisms and efficiency. The superior performance of ZSM-5-Zn in terms of activity and selectivity towards valuable aromatic products (BTX) contributes to its potential industrial significance in alkane transformation processes.

金属基催化剂的组成、结构和反应条件显著影响烷烃转化的机理和效率。在这项研究中，对ZSM-5沸石的锌交换形式（ZSM-5-Zn）和质子交换形式（ZSM-5-H）在丙烷转化为芳烃的过程中进行了研究。

金属交换的沸石（ZSM-5-Zn）与质子形式（ZSM-5-H）相比，表现出更高的活性和更好的BTX（苯、甲苯、二甲苯）选择性。这证明了催化剂组成，特别是锌的存在，如何提高催化性能。

反应机理包括丙烷脱氢，随后进行低聚和芳构化。然而，初级脱氢步骤在两种催化剂上的机理不同。对于ZSM-5-H，脱氢是速率控制的，而对于ZSM-5-Zn，这一步骤处于准平衡状态。这种机理上的差异归因于催化剂结构中锌的存在。

ZSM-5-Zn中的准平衡状态影响转化率和BTX选择性。据推测，锌物种，可能以[Zn-H]+的形式，在控制这些过程中起着关键作用。这表明沸石结构中的金属组分如何影响反应途径和产物分布。

该研究强调了催化剂组成和结构在决定反应机理和效率方面的重要性。ZSM-5-Zn在活性和对有价值的芳烃产品（BTX）的选择性方面表现出色，这有助于提高其在烷烃转化过程中的工业重要性。

This mechanism contributes to the higher efficiency of ZSM-5-Zn in propane transformation.

Reaction conditions, particularly temperature (730-820 K range), play a crucial role in these transformations. The metal-exchanged zeolites' ability to efficiently convert alkanes to valuable aromatic products under these conditions contributes to their industrial significance, as they offer a pathway to produce high-value chemicals from relatively cheap and abundant alkane feedstocks.

The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations. In the case of metal-exchanged zeolites, specifically ZSM-5-Zn and ZSM-5-H, the following factors contribute to their industrial significance in propane conversion:

1. Catalyst composition: The zinc-exchanged form (ZSM-5-Zn) shows higher activity and better BTX (benzene, toluene, xylene) selectivity compared to the proton-exchanged form (ZSM-5-H). This suggests that the metal cation plays a crucial role in enhancing the catalytic performance.

2. Reaction temperature: The study focuses on temperatures between 730-820 K, indicating that high temperatures are necessary for efficient propane conversion to aromatic hydrocarbons.

3. Reaction mechanism: The initial step in propane conversion is likely dehydrogenation to propylene. In ZSM-5-Zn, the zinc cation acts as a hydride acceptor, forming a transient [Zn-H]+ species. This mechanism contributes to the higher activity of ZSM-5-Zn.

4. Equilibrium considerations: For ZSM-5-Zn, the dehydrogenation steps are believed to be in quasi-equilibrium. This equilibrium controls both the overall conversion and the BTX selectivity, involving species like [Zn-H]+.

These factors contribute to the industrial significance of metal-exchanged zeolites, particularly ZSM-5-Zn, in alkane transformation processes. The higher activity and better BTX selectivity of ZSM-5-Zn make it a promising catalyst for the production of valuable aromatic compounds from propane, which is an important industrial process.
