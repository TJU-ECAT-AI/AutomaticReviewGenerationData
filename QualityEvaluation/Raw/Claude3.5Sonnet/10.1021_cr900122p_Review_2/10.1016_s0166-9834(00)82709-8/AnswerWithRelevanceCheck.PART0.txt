          [1] "The zinc-exchanged (ZSM-5-Zn) and proton-exchanged (ZSM-5-H) forms of ZSM-5 zeolite have been studied for the conversion of propane to aromatic hydrocarbons at temperatures in the range 730-820 K."

[2] "ZSM-5-Zn was the more active and gave the better BTX selectivity (60-7OC%)."

[3] "The main features of the conversion mechanism are proposed involving propane dehydrogenation, followed by oligomerization and aromatization."

[4] "The primary dehydrogenation reaction is mechanistically different on the two types of catalyst: over ZSM-5-H dehydrogenation is rate controlled, while over ZSM-5-Zn this step is in quasi-equilibrium."

[5] "We suggest that this effect arises because the respective dehydrogenation steps are in quasi-equilibrium, with reaction 4 controlling the conversion and a dehydrogenation between aromatic and cyclic precursor controlling the BTX selectivity (both processes may well involve species of the type [Zn-H]+, c.f. reaction 4."

[6] "In the case of the ZSM-5-Zn catalyst, we suggest the zinc cation acts as a hydride acceptor to give a transient species such as [Zn-HI+ (and thence hydrogen)"

[7] "Over both ZSM-5-H and ZSM-5-Zn catalysts, ethane reactant was found to be much less reactive than propane: at 870 K the extent of ethane conversion was < 5%."

[8] "With both catalysts, as expected, the propane conversion fell with increasing space velocity but the product distributions behaved differently."

[9] "The apparent activation energies, obtained from Arrhenius plots of the propane conversions, were ZSM-5-Zn (I.28 wt% aluminium), 121+15 kJ mol-'; ZSM-5-Zn (0.71 wt% aluminium), 104+15 kJ mol-'; ZSM-5-H (1.28 wt% aluminium), 120t15 kJ mol-'."

          The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations, particularly in zeolite-catalyzed reactions. Key findings include:

1. Catalyst composition: Zinc-exchanged ZSM-5 (ZSM-5-Zn) shows higher activity and better BTX (benzene, toluene, xylene) selectivity compared to proton-exchanged ZSM-5 (ZSM-5-H). The zinc cation acts as a hydride acceptor, forming transient [Zn-H]+ species.

2. Reaction mechanism: The process involves propane dehydrogenation, followed by oligomerization and aromatization. The primary dehydrogenation step differs mechanistically between ZSM-5-H (rate-controlled) and ZSM-5-Zn (quasi-equilibrium).

3. Reaction conditions:
   - Temperature: Efficient conversion occurs in the range of 730-820 K.
   - Space velocity: Increasing space velocity decreases propane conversion but affects product distribution differently for each catalyst.
   - Reactant type: Propane is much more reactive than ethane under similar conditions.

4. Activation energy: Similar for both catalysts (around 120 kJ/mol), suggesting a similar overall reaction mechanism despite differences in the rate-determining step.

5. Equilibrium considerations: In ZSM-5-Zn, dehydrogenation steps are in quasi-equilibrium, controlling both conversion and BTX selectivity through [Zn-H]+ species.

These factors contribute to the industrial significance of metal-exchanged zeolites, particularly ZSM-5-Zn, in alkane transformation processes. The higher activity and better BTX selectivity of ZSM-5-Zn make it a promising catalyst for the production of valuable aromatic compounds from propane, which is an important industrial process. Understanding these factors can guide the development of more efficient catalysts for industrial applications in petrochemical processes.

          金属基催化剂的组成、结构和反应条件显著影响烷烃转化的机理和效率，特别是在沸石催化反应中。主要发现包括：

1. 催化剂组成：锌交换型ZSM-5（ZSM-5-Zn）比质子交换型ZSM-5（ZSM-5-H）表现出更高的活性和更好的BTX（苯、甲苯、二甲苯）选择性。锌阳离子作为氢化物接受体，形成瞬态[Zn-H]+物种。

2. 反应机理：过程涉及丙烷脱氢，随后进行寡聚和芳构化。主要脱氢步骤在ZSM-5-H（速率控制）和ZSM-5-Zn（准平衡）之间在机理上有所不同。

3. 反应条件：
   - 温度：在730-820 K范围内进行高效转化。
   - 空速：增加空速会降低丙烷转化率，但对每种催化剂的产物分布影响不同。
   - 反应物类型：在相似条件下，丙烷比乙烷更具反应性。

4. 活化能：两种催化剂相似（约120 kJ/mol），表明尽管速率决定步骤不同，但总体反应机理相似。

5. 平衡考虑：在ZSM-5-Zn中，脱氢步骤处于准平衡状态，通过[Zn-H]+物种控制转化率和BTX选择性。

这些因素促进了金属交换沸石，特别是ZSM-5-Zn，在烷烃转化过程中的工业重要性。ZSM-5-Zn的更高活性和更好的BTX选择性使其成为从丙烷生产有价值芳烃化合物的有前景的催化剂，这是一个重要的工业过程。理解这些因素可以指导开发更高效的催化剂，用于石油化工过程中的工业应用。
