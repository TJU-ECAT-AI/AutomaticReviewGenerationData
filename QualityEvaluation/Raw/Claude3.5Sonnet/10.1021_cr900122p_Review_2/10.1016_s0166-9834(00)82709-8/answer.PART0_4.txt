[1] "The zinc-exchanged (ZSM-5-Zn) and proton-exchanged (ZSM-5-H) forms of ZSM-5 zeolite have been studied for the conversion of propane to aromatic hydrocarbons at temperatures in the range 730-820 K."

[2] "ZSM-5-Zn was the more active and gave the better BTX selectivity (60-7OC%)."

[3] "We suggest that this effect arises because the respective dehydrogenation steps are in quasi-equilibrium, with reaction 4 controlling the conversion and a dehydrogenation between aromatic and cyclic precursor controlling the BTX selectivity (both processes may well involve species of the type [Zn-HI+, c.f. reaction 4."

[4] "The first step in the conversion of propane over ZSM-5-H and ZSM+Zn is likely to be dehydrogenation to propylene (either propylene itself or an adsorbed propylene such as iso-C3H;), and so it is convenient to consider first the reaction of propylene over ZSM-5."

[5] "In the case of the ZSM-5-Zn catalyst, we suggest the zinc cation acts as a hydride acceptor to give a transient species such as [Zn-HI+ (and thence hydrogen)"

The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations. In the case of metal-exchanged zeolites, specifically ZSM-5-Zn and ZSM-5-H, the following factors contribute to their industrial significance in propane conversion:

1. Catalyst composition: The zinc-exchanged form (ZSM-5-Zn) shows higher activity and better BTX (benzene, toluene, xylene) selectivity compared to the proton-exchanged form (ZSM-5-H). This suggests that the metal cation plays a crucial role in enhancing the catalytic performance.

2. Reaction temperature: The study focuses on temperatures between 730-820 K, indicating that high temperatures are necessary for efficient propane conversion to aromatic hydrocarbons.

3. Reaction mechanism: The initial step in propane conversion is likely dehydrogenation to propylene. In ZSM-5-Zn, the zinc cation acts as a hydride acceptor, forming a transient [Zn-H]+ species. This mechanism contributes to the higher activity of ZSM-5-Zn.

4. Equilibrium considerations: For ZSM-5-Zn, the dehydrogenation steps are believed to be in quasi-equilibrium. This equilibrium controls both the overall conversion and the BTX selectivity, involving species like [Zn-H]+.

These factors contribute to the industrial significance of metal-exchanged zeolites, particularly ZSM-5-Zn, in alkane transformation processes. The higher activity and better BTX selectivity of ZSM-5-Zn make it a promising catalyst for the production of valuable aromatic compounds from propane, which is an important industrial process.

金属基催化剂的组成、结构和反应条件显著影响烷烃转化的机理和效率。对于金属交换的沸石，特别是ZSM-5-Zn和ZSM-5-H，以下因素促进了它们在丙烷转化中的工业重要性：

1. 催化剂组成：锌交换形式（ZSM-5-Zn）比质子交换形式（ZSM-5-H）表现出更高的活性和更好的BTX（苯、甲苯、二甲苯）选择性。这表明金属阳离子在提高催化性能中起着关键作用。

2. 反应温度：研究集中在730-820 K的温度范围，表明高温对丙烷高效转化为芳烃是必要的。

3. 反应机理：丙烷转化的初始步骤可能是脱氢生成丙烯。在ZSM-5-Zn中，锌阳离子充当氢化物接受体，形成瞬态[Zn-H]+物种。这种机制促进了ZSM-5-Zn的更高活性。

4. 平衡考虑：对于ZSM-5-Zn，脱氢步骤被认为处于准平衡状态。这种平衡控制着总体转化率和BTX选择性，涉及[Zn-H]+等物种。

这些因素促进了金属交换沸石，特别是ZSM-5-Zn，在烷烃转化过程中的工业重要性。ZSM-5-Zn的更高活性和更好的BTX选择性使其成为从丙烷生产有价值芳烃化合物的有前景的催化剂，这是一个重要的工业过程。
