[1] "The zinc-exchanged (ZSM-5-Zn) and proton-exchanged (ZSM-5-H) forms of ZSM-5 zeolite have been studied for the conversion of propane to aromatic hydrocarbons at temperatures in the range 730-820 K."

[2] "ZSM-5-Zn was the more active and gave the better BTX selectivity (60-7OC%)."

[3] "The main features of the conversion mechanism are proposed involving propane dehydrogenation, followed by oligomerization and aromatization."

[4] "The primary dehydrogenation reaction is mechanistically different on the two types of catalyst: over ZSM-5-H dehydrogenation is rate controlled, while over ZSM-5-Zn this step is in quasi-equilibrium."

[5] "We suggest that this effect arises because the respective dehydrogenation steps are in quasi-equilibrium, with reaction 4 controlling the conversion and a dehydrogenation between aromatic and cyclic precursor controlling the BTX selectivity (both processes may well involve species of the type [Zn-H]+, c.f. reaction 4."

The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations. For zeolite-catalyzed reactions, specifically the conversion of propane to aromatic hydrocarbons, the metal-exchanged form (ZSM-5-Zn) shows higher activity and better BTX selectivity compared to the proton-exchanged form (ZSM-5-H). 

The reaction mechanism involves propane dehydrogenation, followed by oligomerization and aromatization. However, the primary dehydrogenation step differs mechanistically between the two catalyst types. In ZSM-5-H, dehydrogenation is rate-controlled, while in ZSM-5-Zn, it exists in quasi-equilibrium.

The zinc-exchanged catalyst (ZSM-5-Zn) demonstrates superior performance due to its unique dehydrogenation mechanism. The quasi-equilibrium state of dehydrogenation steps in ZSM-5-Zn, involving species like [Zn-H]+, controls both the conversion and BTX selectivity. This mechanism contributes to the higher efficiency of ZSM-5-Zn in propane transformation.

Reaction conditions, particularly temperature (730-820 K range), play a crucial role in these transformations. The metal-exchanged zeolites' ability to efficiently convert alkanes to valuable aromatic products under these conditions contributes to their industrial significance, as they offer a pathway to produce high-value chemicals from relatively cheap and abundant alkane feedstocks.

金属基催化剂的组成、结构和反应条件显著影响烷烃转化的机理和效率。对于沸石催化反应，特别是丙烷向芳烃的转化，金属交换形式(ZSM-5-Zn)与质子交换形式(ZSM-5-H)相比，显示出更高的活性和更好的BTX选择性。

反应机理涉及丙烷脱氢，随后是寡聚和芳构化。然而，初级脱氢步骤在两种催化剂类型之间在机理上有所不同。在ZSM-5-H中，脱氢是速率控制的，而在ZSM-5-Zn中，它处于准平衡状态。

锌交换催化剂(ZSM-5-Zn)由于其独特的脱氢机理而表现出优越的性能。ZSM-5-Zn中脱氢步骤的准平衡状态，涉及[Zn-H]+等物种，控制着转化率和BTX选择性。这种机理contributes to ZSM-5-Zn在丙烷转化中的更高效率。

反应条件，特别是温度（730-820 K范围），在这些转化中起着至关重要的作用。金属交换沸石在这些条件下能够有效地将烷烃转化为有价值的芳烃产品，这contributes to它们的工业重要性，因为它们提供了一条从相对便宜和丰富的烷烃原料生产高价值化学品的途径。
