[1] "The zinc-exchanged (ZSM-5-Zn) and proton-exchanged (ZSM-5-H) forms of ZSM-5 zeolite have been studied for the conversion of propane to aromatic hydrocarbons at temperatures in the range 730-820 K."

[2] "ZSM-5-Zn was the more active and gave the better BTX selectivity (60-7OC%)."

[3] "The main features of the conversion mechanism are proposed involving propane dehydrogenation, followed by oligomerization and aromatization."

[4] "The primary dehydrogenation reaction is mechanistically different on the two types of catalyst: over ZSM-5-H dehydrogenation is rate controlled, while over ZSM-5-Zn this step is in quasi-equilibrium."

[5] "We suggest that this effect arises because the respective dehydrogenation steps are in quasi-equilibrium, with reaction 4 controlling the conversion and a dehydrogenation between aromatic and cyclic precursor controlling the BTX selectivity (both processes may well involve species of the type [Zn-H]+, c.f. reaction 4."

The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations. In this study, zinc-exchanged (ZSM-5-Zn) and proton-exchanged (ZSM-5-H) forms of ZSM-5 zeolite were compared for propane conversion to aromatic hydrocarbons.

ZSM-5-Zn showed higher activity and better BTX (benzene, toluene, xylene) selectivity compared to ZSM-5-H. The conversion mechanism involves propane dehydrogenation, followed by oligomerization and aromatization. However, the primary dehydrogenation step differs mechanistically between the two catalysts.

For ZSM-5-H, dehydrogenation is rate-controlled, while for ZSM-5-Zn, it is in quasi-equilibrium. This difference in mechanism leads to varying effects on conversion and selectivity. In ZSM-5-Zn, the dehydrogenation steps are in quasi-equilibrium, with zinc species like [Zn-H]+ likely involved in controlling both conversion and BTX selectivity.

The reaction conditions, particularly temperature (730-820 K), play a crucial role in the conversion process. The metal-exchange (zinc in this case) significantly alters the catalyst's behavior, leading to improved performance in terms of activity and selectivity.

These findings contribute to the industrial significance of metal-exchanged zeolites in alkane transformations by demonstrating their potential for higher aromatic yields and providing insights into the underlying mechanisms. Understanding these factors can guide the development of more efficient catalysts for industrial applications in petrochemical processes.

金属基催化剂的组成、结构和反应条件对烷烃转化的机理和效率有显著影响。在这项研究中，对比了锌交换型（ZSM-5-Zn）和质子交换型（ZSM-5-H）ZSM-5沸石在丙烷转化为芳烃的过程中的表现。

ZSM-5-Zn表现出更高的活性和更好的BTX（苯、甲苯、二甲苯）选择性。转化机理涉及丙烷脱氢，随后进行齐聚和芳构化。然而，初始脱氢步骤在两种催化剂上的机理不同。

对于ZSM-5-H，脱氢是速率控制的，而对于ZSM-5-Zn，这一步骤处于准平衡状态。这种机理上的差异导致了转化率和选择性的不同影响。在ZSM-5-Zn中，脱氢步骤处于准平衡状态，锌物种（如[Zn-H]+）可能参与控制转化率和BTX选择性。

反应条件，特别是温度（730-820 K），在转化过程中起着关键作用。金属交换（本例中为锌）显著改变了催化剂的行为，导致活性和选择性的提高。

这些发现通过展示金属交换沸石在提高芳烃产率方面的潜力，以及提供对潜在机理的见解，为金属交换沸石在烷烃转化中的工业重要性做出了贡献。理解这些因素可以指导开发更高效的催化剂，用于石油化工过程中的工业应用。
