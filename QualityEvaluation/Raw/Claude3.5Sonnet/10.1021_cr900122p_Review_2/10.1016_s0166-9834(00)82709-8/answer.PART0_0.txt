[1] "Over both ZSM-5-H and ZSM-5-Zn catalysts, ethane reactant was found to be much less reactive than propane: at 870 K the extent of ethane conversion was < 5%."

[2] "The zinc-exchanged (ZSM-5-Zn) and proton-exchanged (ZSM-5-H) forms of ZSM-5 zeolite have been studied for the conversion of propane to aromatic hydrocarbons at temperatures in the range 730-820 K. ZSM-5-Zn was the more active and gave the better BTX selectivity (60-7OC%)."

[3] "With both catalysts, as expected, the propane conversion fell with increasing space velocity but the product distributions behaved differently."

[4] "The apparent activation energies, obtained from Arrhenius plots of the propane conversions, were ZSM-5-Zn (I.28 wt% aluminium), 121+15 kJ mol-'; ZSM-5-Zn (0.71 wt% aluminium), 104+15 kJ mol-'; ZSM-5-H (1.28 wt% aluminium), 120t15 kJ mol-'."

[5] "In the case of the ZSM-5-Zn catalyst, we suggest the zinc cation acts as a hydride acceptor to give a transient species such as [Zn-HI+ (and thence hydrogen)"

The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations. For zeolite-catalyzed reactions, particularly propane conversion:

1. Catalyst composition: ZSM-5-Zn shows higher activity and better BTX selectivity compared to ZSM-5-H, indicating that zinc exchange enhances catalytic performance.

2. Structure: Both ZSM-5-H and ZSM-5-Zn have similar activation energies, suggesting a similar reaction mechanism, but ZSM-5-Zn's improved performance may be due to its ability to act as a hydride acceptor.

3. Reaction conditions: 
   - Temperature: Higher temperatures (730-820 K) favor propane conversion to aromatics.
   - Space velocity: Increasing space velocity decreases propane conversion for both catalysts, but affects product distribution differently.

4. Reactant type: Propane is much more reactive than ethane under similar conditions, highlighting the importance of feedstock selection.

These factors contribute to the industrial significance of zeolite catalysts in alkane transformations by allowing for tuneable product distributions and improved conversion efficiencies. The ability to manipulate catalyst composition and reaction conditions enables the optimization of desired product yields, making these processes more economically viable for industrial applications.

金属基催化剂的组成、结构和反应条件对烷烃转化的机理和效率有显著影响。对于沸石催化的反应，特别是丙烷转化：

1. 催化剂组成：与ZSM-5-H相比，ZSM-5-Zn显示出更高的活性和更好的BTX选择性，表明锌交换可以提高催化性能。

2. 结构：ZSM-5-H和ZSM-5-Zn具有相似的活化能，暗示反应机理相似，但ZSM-5-Zn的性能改善可能是由于其作为氢化物受体的能力。

3. 反应条件：
   - 温度：较高的温度（730-820 K）有利于丙烷转化为芳烃。
   - 空速：增加空速会降低两种催化剂的丙烷转化率，但对产物分布的影响不同。

4. 反应物类型：在相似条件下，丙烷比乙烷更具反应性，凸显了原料选择的重要性。

这些因素通过允许可调的产品分布和改进的转化效率，为沸石催化剂在烷烃转化中的工业重要性做出贡献。能够操纵催化剂组成和反应条件使得优化所需产品收率成为可能，从而使这些过程在工业应用中更具经济可行性。
