Abstract 
Additional evidence is presented 
for the role of gallium reduction in preparing 
active Ga/ZSM-5 
catalysts 
for alkane 
aromatization. 
The gallium 
in ion-exchanged 
ZSM-5, both with and without 
addi- 
tional Ga203, 
can be reduced 
to Ga+, in the former case up to a limit determined 
by the number of 
anionic framework 
sites. 
An ion-exchanged, 
reduced 
catalyst 
exhibits similar 
redox 
behavior, 
and is as 
active 
for propane 
aromatization, 
as catalysts 
prepared 
from purely 
physical 
mixtures 
of Ga203 
and H- 
ZSM-5. Although 
reduction 
generates 
dispersed, 
active gallium 
species 
in zeolite 
channels, 
it is shown 
that for ethane 
dehydrogenation 
to aromatics 
the reduced 
(with hydrogen) Ga/ZSM-5 catalysts 
are 
not 
as active 
or selective 
as are 
materials 
which have 
been 
substantially 
reoxidized 
either 
by air 
or by traces 
of oxygen in inert gases. 
A combination of thermogravimetric 
analysis (TGA) , differential 
scanning 
calorimetry (DSC), and X-ray diffraction (XRD) studies 
has been used 
to confirm that rapid reoxi- 
dation takes 
place at 550C. However, 
the reoxidation 
does 
not regenerate 
/I-GasO,, 
but rather 
a higher 
energy, 
dispersed 
Ga3+ 
which appears 
to be optimal 
for production 
of aromatics 
from 
ethane. 
This form 
of Ga3+ is stable 
under reaction 
conditions typical of ethane 
dehydrogenation, 
but can be reduced 
by 
hydrogen.

INTRODUCTION 
Our recent work on gallium-containing MFI catalysts for light alkane aro- 
matization has led us to the conclusion that hydrogen-reduced Ga,O,/ZSM-5 
mixtures, with a least some Gal+ in the starting material, is very active and 
selective for propane aromatization. This conclusion is based upon the obser- 
vations that: (1) selectivities and activities for aromatics production from pro- 
pane were greatly improved with hydrogen pretreatment 
[ 1,2]; (2) we were 
unable to detect gallium insertion into the zeolitic framework upon reduction 
[2]; and (3) we have been able to correlate hydrogen reduction of Ga,O,/H- 
ZSM-5 mechanical mixtures and Ga ( 
NOs),/H-ZSM-5 
impregnated materials

using 
a Ga3+ 
-+Ga+ reduction 
stoichiometry; 
this reduction 
is kinetically 
lim- 
ited 
by the number 
of available 
cation sites 
in the host zeolite [ 
2-41. 
It is generally 
agreed 
that the primary 
role of extra-framework 
gallium 
in 
these materials 
is to enhance 
rates of alkene, 
diene, 
or cycloalkene 
dehydro- 
genation [5-81. High

area 
GazO, and steamed 
gallosilicates 
by them- 
selves 
can 
aromatize 
aliphatic 
dienes, 
1-hexene, 
and 
cyclohexene 
at significant 
rates 
over the temperature 
range 
500-600 C [ 7,8]. Therefore 
the dispersion 
and 
the 
oxidation 
state 
of gallium 
within 
zeolite 
channels 
should 
greatly 
affect 
the relative 
rates 
of alkane 
dehydrogenation 
and hydrocracking; 
the aromat- 
ics/methane selectivity 
ratio 
should 
be a good indicator 
of these 
relative 
rates. 
Propane aromatization 
as a test reaction for Ga-zeolite catalysts 
presents 
some 
problems. 
Conversions 
and aromatics 
selectivities 
for Ga/H-ZSM-5 cat- 
alysts 
are 
typically 
high 
in 
the temperature 
range 
at 
which 
reduction 
of Ga,O, 
readily 
occurs ( > 520 
* 
C ) 
, even 
for catalysts 
prepared 
very 
differently; 
second- 
ary 
products 
such 
as C 
a+ aromatics 
are 
readily 
formed [5,6,9-111, and 
there- 
fore coking is also a problem. In order 
to distinguish 
more clearly 
the effects 
of various 
pretreatment 
cliques 
on catalyst 
performance, 
we 
have 
also 
tested 
various 
preparations 
of Ga/ZSM-5 for the 
dehyogenation of ethane. 
For 
this 
probe 
reaction, 
differences 
in 
the 
catalytic 
performance 
of differently 
prepared 
MFI materials, 
especially 
in their selectivities 
to aromatics 
and methane, 
are 
often pronounced [ 
12,131. 
In order 
to give 
high 
yields 
to aromatics, 
rhenium, 
platinum, 
or rhodium 
are 
often added 
to the catalysts 
in small 
amounts. 
The aims of the work 
presented 
in this paper were: (1) to obtain evidence 
that gallium-exchanged 
materials 
also fall into our stoichiometric 
theory on 
gallium 
reduction; 
and (2) to demonstrate 
that 
although 
the 
reduction 
of Ga& 
is necessary 
to disperse 
gallium 
within the zeolite, the form of the catalyst 
which is most active and selective 
for the production of aromatics 
does not 
consist 
of reduced 
Ga+ as framework 
cations. 
EXPERIMENTAL 
The H-ZSM-5 was provided 
by UOP (MYI, Si02/A1203=40, acid-washed 
and 
calcined) . A Ga/MFI mechanically 
mixed 
material 
was 
prepared 
by ball- 
milling 
j?-Ga203 
(4N5 grade, 
Ingal) with 
the H-form of the zeolite 
for 3 h and 
is denoted 
Ga/HMFI. Its gallium 
content was 
5.0 
wt.-%. The second 
material 
(denoted 
GaMFI ) was 
prepared 
beginning 
with 
two successive 
ion exchanges 
of 5 equivalents 
of Ga 
( 
NOa 
)3 
aqueous 
solution 
with 
HMFI, with 
slow 
heating 
to 500 C in flowing helium 
after exchanges. 
A partly exchanged, 
partly me- 
chanically 
mixed 
material 
was 
then prepared 
by ball-milling 
some GaMFI 
for 
3 h with 3.1 wt.-% Ga as /3-Ga203 
to produce a material 
with a theoretical 
overall 
gallium 
content of ca. 5 wt.-% (denoted Ga/GaMFI). These materials 
were 
pressed, 
crushed, 
and sieved 
into particles 
of 20-40 mesh. 
A microbalance (Du Pont TGA 951), accurate 
to 20.02 mg, was used to 
K.M. Dooky et al./Appl. Catal. A 84 (1992) 17-30 
19 
determine the hydrogen reduction potentials of all materials. After drying to 
constant weight in nitrogen at 65OC, the sample was cooled to the desired 
temperature in nitrogen and the flow was switched to 20-50% Hz/N,; total 
flow was about 50 cm3/min. A calorimeter (Stanton Redcroft PL700 DSC) 
was used to follow the redox behavior of dried Ga/HMFI by heating first in 
50 cm3/min of 30% Hz/N2 (575(J), then in nitrogen (55OC), then in air 
(200-56O;C). 
A Scintag PAD-V and Philips PW 1710 X-ray diffractometers equipped with 
Cu Ka radiation sources were used to obtain X-ray diffraction (XRD) data. 
Bulk compositions were determined by X-ray fluorescence (XRF) on a Philips 
PW 1480 XRF spectrometer. Gaz03 (Fluka, 99.99% ) was used as the gallium 
standard. 
For catalytic activity measurements, 0.8-0.9 g of particles were loaded in a 
stainless steel tubular reactor (10 mm I.D.). Prior to reaction, catalysts were 
pretreated in a 30% Hz/He (62.5 cm3/min total) mixture as follows: 100 C for 
2 h, 100C to 575 C (1 OC/min), 575 C for 2 h. This standard reduction 
pretreatment was followed by other pretreatments described in the Results. 
For the reactions of either propane (weight hourly space velocity, WHSV= 1.3) 
or ethane (WHSV= l.O), the feed was 12% hydrocarbon in helium at 1 bar. 
Products were analyzed on line with a Hewlett-Packard 5880 GC, using both 
a 1.8 m Carbosieve B (Alltech) packed column for light gas analysis and a 30 
m wide bore capillary column (Supleco SPB-1) for analysis of C,, aliphatics 
and aromatics. 
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 
Comparison of ion-exchanged and physically mixed Ga/ZSM-5 
The ion-exchanged, calcined GaMFI contained 2.22 wt.-% Ga by XRF, and 
the material with added /?-Ga203 (Ga/GaMFI) 
contained 5.17%. The Si/Al 
ratios of these and the starting material were identical. 
The XRD patterns in the range 28= 24-36 were used to determine roughly 
( 5 0.2 wt.-% Ga based on repeat experiments on a physical mixture) the initial 
amounts of gallium asp-Ga,O, in Ga/ZSM-5 materials. 
The sum of peak heights 
at 28 values of about 31.7 and 35.2 (b-Ga,O, lines) divided by the sum of 
peak heights at 28values of about 24.3 and 29.2 o (ZSM-5 lines) is proportional 
to the ratio /3-Ga,O,/ZSM-5 
[ 21. Samples of MFI and unreduced Ga/HMFI 
were used to determine the proportionality constant. According to this tech- 
nique, GaMFI contained 0.5 wt.-% Ga as B-Ga203 and Ga/GaMFI contained 
3.4% Ga. Note that 3.6% would be expected for Ga/GaMFI assuming 3.1% 
from the added fi-Ga203 plus 0.5% from calcination of the GaMFI, so the re- 
sults were consistent within the accuracy of the technique. The maximum 
loading of exchanged gallium was therefore 1.7 wt.-% in GaMFI. This loading 
20 
KM Dooley et al./Appl. CataL A 84 (1992) 17-30 
is similar 
to that found 
when 
exchanging 
other 
WI materials 
with 
Ga 
(NO& 
from aqueous 
solution [ 15 
1, and 
the percentage 
exchange 
of Brensted 
sites 
is 
almost 
the 
same 
as 
that reported 
by Romannikov 
et al. [ 161, 
as 
determined 
by 
pyridine adsorption. We conclude that our material 
was typical of gallium- 
exchanged 
MFI. 
It is generally 
accepted that it is difficult to exchange 
trivalent 
ions into 
ZSM-5, 
because 
the 
lattice 
is 
relatively 
hydrophobic 
and 
the 
anion 
field 
is 
weak, 
precipitation of hydroxides and exchange of metal hydroxide ions such as 
[M (OH),] + cannot 
usually 
be avoided 
[ 141. 
Therefore 
it is 
imible to know 
the true 
state 
of exchange 
of all gallium 
in GaMFI. 
However, 
the XRD results 
indicated 
that as much 
as 75% of the gallium 
added 
during 
the exchange 
pro- 
cedure 
was 
amorphous 
even 
after 
calcination 
at 500C Our 
purpose 
here 
was 
not to ion-exchange 
Ga3+ 
at every 
available 
anionic 
site in the zeolite 
frame- 
work, 
but rather 
to duplicate 
catalysts 
prepared 
in the literature 
by ion-ex- 
change 
techniques. 
If the presence 
of 1.7 
wt.-% exchanged 
Ga3+ 
in GaMFI 
is assumed 
(with all 
remaining 
gallium 
present 
as 
Ga,O, ) 
, complete 
reduction 
of this 
material 
with 
loss of water should result 
in a 0.10% weight 
decrease 
assuming 
the stoichi- 
ometry (where 
Z- is the anionic 
zeolite 
framework): 
Ga3+(Z-)3+Hz+Ga+Z-+2H+Z- 
(1) 
Gaz03+2Hz+2H+Z--+ZGa+Z-+3H,O 
(2) 
Reaction (2) represents 
the previously 
determined 
reduction stoichiomet 
for /3-Gaz03/ZSM-5 mixtures [2], and we assume 
that it is applicable 
to re- 
duction 
of any form 
of Ga,O, as long 
as anionic 
framework 
sites 
are 
available. 
However, 
if the primary 
exchanging 
ion is [Ga(OH),] +, the following 
reac- 
tions would 
be expected 
to occur instead 
of reaction (1): 
[Ga(OH),]+Z--+ (GaO)+Z-+HzO 
(3) 
(GaO)+Z- +Hz +Ga+Z- +H,O 
(4) 
Reactions (2)-(4) should 
generate 
a 1.01% 
weight 
loss for GaMFI during 
the 
reduction; however, if the dtying process completed reaction (3), then the 
weight 
loss during 
reduction 
would 
be only 0.58%. The final weight 
loss after 
reduction 
at 
620C was 
0.962 0.12% (Fig. 1 
), suggesting 
that [Ga(OH),] +Z- 
was 
present 
after 
drying, 
and 
that it was 
almost 
completely 
reduced 
by hydro- 
gen 
at 620C. 
For 
Ga/GaMFI, according 
to the 
sichiomet of reactions 
(2)- (4)) p-Ga,O, 
was in slight excess, Z- limited the reaction, and we compute an expected 
weight 
loss of 1.61%, 
in fair agreement 
with the final 
weight 
loss actually 
ob- 
served (1.43 
t 0.06%, Fig. 1). Isothermal 
reduction 
curves 
for GafHMFI cat- 
alysts 
have already 
been reported, 
and at less than 600C could only be suc- 
cessfully 
correlated 
by the stoichiometry 
of reaction (2 
) [ 21. 
We propose 
that

at the higher drying temperature used here (650 C ) a small amount of GazOs 
was reduced prior to the introduction of hydrogen, in agreement with the 
chemistry of bulk Ga203 at > 600 C [ 171. We again emphasize that if the 
exchanged gallium were present as Ga 
3+ the weight losses would have been 
much smaller than those observed. 
The product of the reductions of both Ga/HMFI and Ga/GaMFI according 
to our theory was basically the same, and the total gallium contents were also 
similar, 5.0% for Ga/HMFI and 5.2% for Ga/GaMFI. Therefore we expected 
the materials to have similar catalytic properties. Unfortunately direct com- 
parison of activity was difficult because the materials continued to undergo 
activation (after the standard hydrogen pretreatment) even in helium for a 
period of several days. This activation is examined in more detail in the next 
section. Table 1 shows the results of propane aromatization experiments and 
demonstrates the slow activation process, in this case for Ga/HMFI 
(runs 
2-5 ) 
. The activity and selectivity of Ga/GaMFI (Run 1) fell roughly between 
Runs 3 and 4 for Ga/HMFI. Both selectivities to aromatics and overall activ- 
ities were comparable. In conclusion, both the microbalance reduction and the 
catalytic reaction results suggest that ion-exchanged materials underwent sub- 
stantial reduction of gallium, as did purely mechanically mixed materials. 
However, the reaction studies suggested that the as reduced form of the cat- 
alyst was not optimal. 
Gallium-exchanged ZSM-5 (without subsequent Gaz03 loading) has been 
reported to be an active and selective alkane aromatization catalyst [5,9,11- 
13,18,19]. However, the pretreatment conditions in these experiments varied

widely. Gane [ 
191 has stated that catalytic performance is improved by hydro- 
gen reduction at 600-700C followed by oxidation in air at 500-600C. The 
efficacy of the oxidation step following reduction was established using Ga/ 
HMFI (vide infra). Davidsons patent [ 
181 primarily concerns the regenera- 
tion of deactivated catalysts, but includes hydrogen reduction as a step in the 
activity restoration process. We have shown previously that reduction can pro- 
ceed on-stream with a propane feed [ 11, even if the catalyst is not pretreated 
with hydrogen. 
Pretreatment effects on aromatics and methane formation 
The differences in conversion and selectivity to aromatics between runs 4 
and 5 in Table 1 merited further study, because it appeared as if helium treat- 
ment alone was sufficient to further activate the catalysts. The catalytic per- 
formance of Ga/HMFI for ethane matization 
was therefore examined fol- 
lowing various gaseous pretreatments A-D which were carried out after the 
standard reduction. For sample A there was a short 300C purge in helium 
only; sample B was contacted with air for 5 h at 550 C; sample C with helium 
for 5 h at 550C; and for D the same treatment was used as for B, but then 
followed by a second standard reduction. The activity and selectivity data 
so obtained are shown in Figs. 2 and 3. All the catalysts were only slightly 
deactivated during the reactions; for example, the activity of the Ga/HMFI-D 
catalyst decreased by less than 10% during a period of 12 h time onstream. 
From Figs. 2 and 3 it is evident that the catalysts exhibited high selectivity to 
aromatics; the selectivity to ethylene and C, + aromatics usually increased with 
respect to temperature, while the selectivity to methane and BTX aromatics 
usually decreased.

lows: the first hydrogen reduction at 575 C (sample A) dispersed B-Ga,O, in 
the zeolite by converting it to GazO and then to Ga+ by reaction (2). Reoxi- 
dation in air at 550  C 
(sample B ) then converted the reduced amework Ga+ 
to dispersed, amorphous Ga,Og, GaO+ cations, or a mixture of the two forms. 
The oxidation process also took place to some extent with trace oxygen and 
water in the helium at 550C (sample C; also see the next section), although 
not as effectively as with air (sample B). Then in the second treatment with 
30% H,/He at 575C, Ga3+ was re-reduced to Ga+ (sample D). The activity 
and aromatics selectivities of Ga/HMFI-D were relatively low, suggesting that 
more Ga+ was present after the second reduction. 
The dispersion of gallium in the zeolite has been confirmed by obseation 
upon reduction of an almost ten-fold increase in the Ga (3d) peak intensity in 
the XPS spectrum [20]; this intensity was unaffected by removal of 15-20 
monolayers from the particles. The peak shifted 0.7 eV lower upon reduction, 
indicative of a formal lowering of the gallium oxidation state; the binding en- 
ergy difference between gallium in p-Ga,O, and elemental gallium is 2.6 eV. 
TEM and EDAX studies have shown that the j?-GazO, crystals disappear upon 
reduction with simultaneous transfer of gallium to within zeolite particles [ 
211. 
This process was accompanied by subsntial minution of the framework - 
OH band (3610 cm-l) 
intensity [21,22]. 
The very low amounts of methane obtained with treatment D also suggest 
Ga+ zeolitic cations were present after reduction. For GafZSM-5 materials 
(ion-exchanged, impregnated, or mechanically mixed), methane formation is 
associated with framework Brensted acid sites [ 
7,8,23]. However, aromatiza- 
tion of the lower alkanes also requires the presence of at least some Brernsted 
sites [5,7,8]. Comparing treatments A and D, it appears as if a particular 
Bronsted site concentration is associated with optimum yields to aromatics. 
Comparing the methane selectivities for treatments A and B, we speculate that 
the reoxidized material contains more H+, and therefore more extra-fiame- 
work gallium oxide within the zeolite. 
The reoxidized Ga/HMFI was the best catalyst for ethane aromatization. 
This finding is in qualitative agreement with previous results for n-butane 
aromatization with a reoxidized Ga/H-ZSM-5 
[ 191, n-butane aromatization 
with oxygen addition to the feed [23], and propane aromatization after air 
regeneration of deactivated catalysts [ 8,241. It is also in line with the finding 
that hydrogen uptake is quadrupled for an impregnated Ga/H-ZSM-5 
after 
roughly 70% reoxidation at 450C [5], assuming the rate of associative de- 
sorption of hydrogen would be similarly enhanced. The reoxidized Ga/HMFI

of Ga/HMFI. Using the XRD procedure outlined previously, the wt.-% Ga as 
P-Ga203 was determined; some example XRD data are shown in Fig. 4. The 
j?-Ga203 line widths (31.7 and 35.2 ) were unchanged upon reduction, and 
the crystallite sizes were in excess of 300 A using the Scherrer equation. There- 
fore the estimate of p-Gaz03 content in reduced Ga/HMFI-A should be accu- 
rate. By this technique fresh Ga/HMFI-A 
contained 2.5 ?0.2%, 
fresh Ga/ 
HMFI-B 2.2%, and the used catalysts B and C contained 2.1-2.4% Ga as p- 
Ga,O,. We conclude that the initial reduction was incomplete, and that the 
reoxidation (sample B ) did not regenerate crystalline &GazOs. However, the 
dispersed gallium created by the initial reduction with hydrogen was only 
slightly augmented by on-line reduction when using ethane feed, because the 
/3-Ga203 contents of freshly pretreated and used catalysts were similar. 
Pretreatment C (inert gas at 550 C for 5 h after the standard reduction) of 
the reaction experiments was duplicated in the TGA and some of these data 
are shown in Fig. 5. It is evident that reoxidation of Ga/HMFI was possible 
using trace amounts of oxygen (here ca. 100 ppm); 75% of the weight loss due 
to reduction was regained upon reoxidation for 5 h. It is concluded that a sim- 
ilar phenomenon was largely responsible for the helium activation of Ga/ 
HMFI in the reaction experiments, although enhanced gallium dispersion may

also play a role in any high-temperature gas treatment of gallium oxides. Pro- 
longed ( > 12 h) inert gas treatment resulted in 94 + 4% weight regain. 
The partly ion-exchanged GafGaMFI 
could also be almost completely 
(97 + 4% ) reoxidized at 550 C; however, as shown in Fig. 1, only about 70% of 
the gallium was rapidly reoxidized. It can therefore be concluded that there 
was negligible loss of Ga,O in the pretreatments, which is undersble 
if 
the GaaO reacts immediately with the zeolite as proposed above (reaction (2) ). 
In practice, even reoxidized Ga/ZSM-5 catalysts may contain some gallium as 
framework cations (e.g., [ 
GaO ] + ), because the final stage of reoxidation is so 
slow. 
Re-reduction with hydrogen of reoxidized material (simulating sample D, 
Fig. 2) gave the same weight loss as in the initial reduction, 1.44 ? 0.69% [ com- 
pare 1.78% for complete reduction according to reaction (2) 1; complete stoi- 
chiometric reduction was found to be possible only at higher temperature 
( 
620 
 C ). The catalysts used in the ethane dehydrogenation experiments (Figs. 
2 and 3) should therefore have been only partly reduced by the standard 
pretreatment; this is in agreement with the XRD results. 
The redox cycle of sample B was also reproduced in the DSC, with the drying/ 
reduction portion shown in Fig. 6. The sum of the heats of endothermic tran- 
sitions was ca. 58 mJ/mg. For complete reduction offl-Ga,O, to Ga,O, the heat 
requirement would be 73 mJ/mg for this sample. The actual heat of reduction

should indeed be smaller than 73 mJ/mg, because the second step of the overall 
reduction [reaction (3) ] is: 
GazO+2H+Z-+2Ga+Z-+2H,O 
(5) 
This step is exothermic, as determined from thermodynamic calculations us- 
ing either gas phase or aqueous heats of formation for H+ and Ga+. When 
aqueous phase values are used, for example, the overall heat of reduction ac- 
cording to reaction (2) was computed to be 49 mJ/mg. 
Reoxidation in the DSC showed a much larger exothermic heat of transition, 
from 760 to 1050 mJ/mg, depending upon whether the sample was oxidized 
slowly (decrease temperature to 2OOC, purge, admit air, then increase tem- 
perature) or rapidly (decrease temperature to 55OC, purge, admit air, then 
isothermal). Some of this excess heat over the calculated heat of reduction 
resulted from the oxidation of adsorbed hydrogen; however, it is unlikely that 
the entire excess can be attributed to this one factor. This was especially true 
of the slow reoxidation experiment (Fig. 7), in which an additional exotherm 
at lower temperature probably corresponded to combustion of some of the ad- 
sorbed hydrogen; for air treatment of non-prereduced GaHMFI, the DSC 
showed only a very weak low-temperature exotherm (Fig. 7). We speculate 
that some of the excess heat was necessary to generate Ga,O, in a dispersed, 
amorphous form in the zeolite channels. It was unlikely that (GaO) +Z- was 
the ultimate product of reoxidation, because the weight regains were too high; 
a 64% regain would correspond to formation of (GaO ) +Z- in Ga/HMFI, and 
57-73% in Ga/GaMFI, while 9424 and 9754% 
regains were observed, re- 
spectively. It is certainly possible that the rapid weight regains in the first few

hours (75 and 70%, respectively) were associated with GaO+Z- 
formation, 
but the long-term results confirmed that Ga&, was the ultimate product of 
long-term reoxidation. 
From the results of Figs. 1 and 5 we can conclude that reoxidation in the 
microreactor would not have been complete. So the highly active and selective 
Ga/MFI-B 
probably included both gallium framework cations and extra- 
framework Ga,O,. This may be a desirable combination for enhancing desorp- 
tion rates of hydrogen, and therefore rates of aromatization. Uptakes of hy- 
drogen actually increased after short reductions of impregnated GafH-ZSM- 
5 at 450C [ 
51 and of a-GazO, at 300C [25]. It is difficult to separate the 
effects of increased dispersion from change in oxidation state, but the second 
example in particular and our own data lead us to speculate that hydrogen 
desorption may be optimal with dispersed gallium oxide species whose average 
oxidation state is somewhat less than 3 + . 
CONCLUSIONS 
(1) Ga/ZSM-5 catalysts contain Ga3+/Ga+ 
in the form of a redox pair. 
The extent of reduction to Ga+ for catalysts prepared by both ion exchange 
and mechanical mixing techniques is limited by the availability of anionic lat- 
tice sites. Reduction with hydrogen is typically incomplete (Ga+ /Z- < 1) at 
575 C but complete at 620 o 
C. 
(2 ) Optimal catalysts for ethane aromatization are prepared by reduction 
with hydrogen to disperse the gallium, followed by reoxidation to a dispersed 
Ga3+ phase. In real-world catalysts, some or all Ga3+ could be in the form of

29 
( 
GaO ) + ions, because the ultimate product of reoxidation, dispersed Ga203, is 
formed very slowly at 550 C. Reoxidized catalysts are stable under the reaction 
conditions used here (530-570 C, low hydrocarbon partial pressures), but are 
not stable to re-reduction by hydrogen at higher partial pressures. 
(3) A substantially reduced catalyst (Ga+/Z- ca. 1) is both less active and 
selective for aromatics formation. Such catalysts also show lower hydrocrack- 
ing activities than either unreduced or reoxidized materials, because of the 
reduction in Brnrnsted acidity associated with the transformation 
to Ga+Z- 
sites. 
(4) TGA reduction studies suggest that [ Ga (OH),] + is the exchanging ion 
in ion-exchanged (from aqueous solution) Ga/ZSM-5 catalysts, and that these 
ions can also be reduced to Ga+ with hydrogen. Reduced catalysts of this type 
are similar both in their catalytic and in their redox behavior to reduced cat- 
alysts prepared from mechanical mixtures of ZSM-5 and jI-Ga203.
