[1] "Additional evidence is presented for the role of gallium reduction in preparing active Ga/ZSM-5 catalysts for alkane aromatization."

[2] "Although reduction generates dispersed, active gallium species in zeolite channels, it is shown that for ethane dehydrogenation to aromatics the reduced (with hydrogen) Ga/ZSM-5 catalysts are not as active or selective as are materials which have been substantially reoxidized either by air or by traces of oxygen in inert gases."

[3] "Optimal catalysts for ethane aromatization are prepared by reduction with hydrogen to disperse the gallium, followed by reoxidation to a dispersed Ga3+ phase."

[4] "A substantially reduced catalyst (Ga+/Z- ca. 1) is both less active and selective for aromatics formation. Such catalysts also show lower hydrocracking activities than either unreduced or reoxidized materials, because of the reduction in Brønsted acidity associated with the transformation to Ga+Z- sites."

[5] "It is generally agreed that the primary role of extra-framework gallium in these materials is to enhance rates of alkene, diene, or cycloalkene dehydrogenation"

The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations in processes like aromatization and dehydrogenation. 

For Ga/ZSM-5 catalysts used in alkane aromatization:

1. The reduction of gallium is crucial in preparing active catalysts, as it generates dispersed, active gallium species in zeolite channels.

2. However, for ethane dehydrogenation to aromatics, catalysts that have been substantially reoxidized (either by air or traces of oxygen in inert gases) are more active and selective than those reduced with hydrogen.

3. The optimal catalysts are prepared by first reducing with hydrogen to disperse the gallium, then reoxidizing to form a dispersed Ga3+ phase.

4. Catalysts with a high degree of reduction (Ga+/Z- ratio close to 1) are less active and selective for aromatics formation. They also show lower hydrocracking activities due to reduced Brønsted acidity.

5. The primary role of extra-framework gallium in these materials is to enhance the rates of alkene, diene, or cycloalkene dehydrogenation.

These factors contribute to the industrial significance of these catalysts by allowing for tuning of catalyst properties to optimize performance in specific alkane transformation processes. The ability to control the oxidation state and dispersion of gallium species through reduction and reoxidation treatments provides a means to tailor catalyst activity and selectivity for desired products.

金属基催化剂的组成、结构和反应条件显著影响烷烃转化过程(如芳构化和脱氢)的机理和效率。

对于用于烷烃芳构化的Ga/ZSM-5催化剂：

1. 镓的还原对制备活性催化剂至关重要,因为它在沸石通道中生成分散的、活性的镓物种。

2. 然而,对于乙烷脱氢生成芳烃,经过充分再氧化(通过空气或惰性气体中的微量氧)的催化剂比用氢还原的催化剂更活跃、更选择性。

3. 最佳催化剂的制备方法是先用氢还原以分散镓,然后再氧化形成分散的Ga3+相。

4. 高度还原的催化剂(Ga+/Z-比接近1)对芳烃生成的活性和选择性较低。由于Brønsted酸性降低,它们还表现出较低的加氢裂化活性。

5. 这些材料中框架外镓的主要作用是提高烯烃、二烯烃或环烯烃的脱氢速率。

这些因素通过允许调整催化剂性能以优化特定烷烃转化过程的性能,从而提高了这些催化剂的工业重要性。通过还原和再氧化处理控制镓物种的氧化态和分散度的能力,为根据所需产品调整催化剂活性和选择性提供了方法。
