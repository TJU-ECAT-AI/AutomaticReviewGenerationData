[3] "Binuclear sites are argued to account for the enhanced activity of oxygenated gallium-exchanged high-silica zeolites in alkane dehydrogenation."

[4] "These sites, however, tend to decompose via water desorption upon the catalytic reaction resulting in less reactive reduced Ga+ ions."

[5] "As per predictions from the quantum-chemical calculations, the experimental results show that the high alkane dehydrogenation activity can be maintained by in situ hydrolysis of the reduced extraframework Ga species."

[6] "Clearly, co-feeding of water leads to a substantial increase of the propane conversion. The conversion passes a maximum at pH2O of 0.3 kPa."

[7] "The promoting effect of water is due to the formation of reactive partly hydrolyzed gallium species such as [HGaOGaOH]2+ and [HGa(OH)2GaH]2+ discussed above."

The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations:

1. For supported vanadium oxides, the structure-activity relationship is key to understanding their catalytic behavior in heterogeneous catalysis.

2. In zeolites, the confined spaces play a crucial role in reactivity, with the interplay between spectroscopy and theory helping to develop structure-activity relationships.

3. For gallium-exchanged high-silica zeolites, binuclear sites enhance activity in alkane dehydrogenation. However, these sites can decompose during catalysis, forming less reactive reduced Ga+ ions.

4. Water co-feeding is crucial for maintaining high alkane dehydrogenation activity. It promotes the formation of reactive partly hydrolyzed gallium species, leading to increased propane conversion.

5. The optimal water partial pressure for maximum conversion was found to be 0.3 kPa in the studied system.

These factors contribute to the industrial significance of these catalysts by:

1. Allowing for fine-tuning of catalyst performance through control of metal species structure and composition.
2. Enabling the maintenance of high catalytic activity through careful control of reaction conditions, such as water co-feeding.
3. Providing insights into catalyst deactivation mechanisms and ways to mitigate them, ensuring longer catalyst lifetimes and more efficient processes.

金属基催化剂的组成、结构和反应条件显著影响烷烃转化的机理和效率：

1. 对于负载型钒氧化物，结构-活性关系是理解其在多相催化中的催化行为的关键。

2. 在沸石中，受限空间对反应活性起着至关重要的作用，光谱和理论之间的相互作用有助于发展结构-活性关系。

3. 对于镓交换的高硅沸石，双核位点增强了烷烃脱氢的活性。然而，这些位点在催化过程中可能会分解，形成反应性较低的还原态Ga+离子。

4. 共进料水对维持高烷烃脱氢活性至关重要。它促进了部分水解的活性镓物种的形成，导致丙烷转化率增加。

5. 在研究的系统中，最大转化率的最佳水分压力为0.3 kPa。

这些因素通过以下方式促进了这些催化剂的工业重要性：

1. 通过控制金属物种的结构和组成，可以对催化剂性能进行精细调节。
2. 通过仔细控制反应条件（如水的共进料），可以维持高催化活性。
3. 提供了催化剂失活机理的见解以及减轻失活的方法，确保了更长的催化剂寿命和更高效的过程。
