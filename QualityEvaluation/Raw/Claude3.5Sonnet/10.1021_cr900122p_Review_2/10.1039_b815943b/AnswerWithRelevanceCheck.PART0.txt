          [1] "Supported vanadium oxide in heterogeneous catalysis: elucidating the structureactivity relationship with spectroscopy"

[2] "Reactivity in the confined spaces of zeolites: the interplay between spectroscopy and theory to develop structureactivity relationships for catalysis"

[3] "Binuclear sites are argued to account for the enhanced activity of oxygenated gallium-exchanged high-silica zeolites in alkane dehydrogenation."

[4] "These sites, however, tend to decompose via water desorption upon the catalytic reaction resulting in less reactive reduced Ga+ ions."

[5] "As per predictions from the quantum-chemical calculations, the experimental results show that the high alkane dehydrogenation activity can be maintained by in situ hydrolysis of the reduced extraframework Ga species."

[6] "Clearly, co-feeding of water leads to a substantial increase of the propane conversion. The conversion passes a maximum at pH2O of 0.3 kPa."

[7] "The promoting effect of water is due to the formation of reactive partly hydrolyzed gallium species such as [HGaOGaOH]2+ and [HGa(OH)2GaH]2+ discussed above."

[8] "Addition of water to the hydrocarbon feed increases significantly the dehydrogenation activity. The main product remains propylene although with increasing water content, formation of the products of propane cracking (methane and ethylene) is observed."

[9] "Formation of less stable intermediate products in the catalytic cycle facilitates the regeneration of the active site. Indeed, moderate barriers are calculated for H2 recombination in the catalytic cycle involving [HGa(OH)(O)Ga]2+ species."

[10] "Although earlier isolated mononuclear GaO+ have been proposed as the active sites in Ga-containing high-silica zeolites, the present results indicate that such species should oligomerize in the microporous space, independent of the Al distribution."

          The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations, particularly in processes such as oxidative dehydrogenation and zeolite-catalyzed reactions:

1. Structure-activity relationships: For supported vanadium oxides and zeolites, understanding the structure-activity relationship is crucial for elucidating catalytic behavior in heterogeneous catalysis.

2. Confined spaces in zeolites: The reactivity in zeolites is greatly affected by their confined spaces, with spectroscopy and theory interplaying to develop structure-activity relationships.

3. Binuclear sites: In gallium-exchanged high-silica zeolites, binuclear sites are believed to enhance activity in alkane dehydrogenation, rather than isolated mononuclear GaO+ species.

4. Water's role: The presence of water significantly affects catalyst performance. Co-feeding water increases dehydrogenation activity by forming reactive partly hydrolyzed gallium species. An optimal water partial pressure (0.3 kPa) was found for maximum conversion.

5. Active site regeneration: Less stable intermediate products in the catalytic cycle facilitate the regeneration of active sites, with moderate barriers calculated for H2 recombination.

6. Species oligomerization: Gallium species tend to oligomerize in the microporous space of zeolites, independent of aluminum distribution, leading to more active catalytic sites.

These factors contribute to the industrial significance of these catalysts by:
- Allowing for fine-tuning of catalyst performance through control of metal species structure and composition.
- Enabling the maintenance of high catalytic activity through careful control of reaction conditions, such as water co-feeding.
- Providing insights into catalyst deactivation mechanisms and ways to mitigate them, ensuring longer catalyst lifetimes and more efficient processes.
- Optimizing desired product yields while minimizing unwanted side reactions.

          金属基催化剂的组成、结构和反应条件显著影响烷烃转化的机理和效率，特别是在氧化脱氢和沸石催化反应等过程中：

1. 结构-活性关系：对于负载型钒氧化物和沸石，理解结构-活性关系对阐明多相催化中的催化行为至关重要。

2. 沸石中的受限空间：沸石中的反应活性受其受限空间的极大影响，光谱和理论相互作用以发展结构-活性关系。

3. 双核位点：在镓交换的高硅沸石中，双核位点被认为可以增强烷烃脱氢的活性，而不是单核GaO+物种。

4. 水的作用：水的存在显著影响催化剂性能。共进料水通过形成反应性部分水解的镓物种来增加脱氢活性。发现最佳水分压（0.3 kPa）可获得最大转化率。

5. 活性位点再生：催化循环中较不稳定的中间产物有利于活性位点的再生，计算表明H2重组的能垒适中。

6. 物种寡聚化：镓物种倾向于在沸石的微孔空间中寡聚化，这独立于铝的分布，从而形成更活跃的催化位点。

这些因素通过以下方式促进了这些催化剂的工业重要性：
- 通过控制金属物种的结构和组成，可以对催化剂性能进行精细调节。
- 通过仔细控制反应条件（如水的共进料），可以维持高催化活性。
- 提供了催化剂失活机理的见解以及减轻失活的方法，确保了更长的催化剂寿命和更高效的过程。
- 优化所需产品收率，同时最大限度地减少不必要的副反应。
