[1] "Copper-exchanged ZSM-5 zeolite (CuZSM-5) is known to exhibit a high catalytic activity in the selective decomposition of NO into molecular oxygen and nitrogen."

[2] "The copper adsorption centers could be formed both in an indirect way after reduction of dimeric oxygen-bridged [CuOCu]21 species or directly by high-temperature reaction of the hydrogen form with the CuCl vapour at elevated temperature."

[3] "Ethane is adsorbed by Cu(I)-ZSM-5 at room temperature in at least two different forms. The first of them does not exhibit any significant perturbation of adsorbed molecules."

[4] "The second form of molecular ethane adsorption occurs on the isolated Cu1 ions stabilized in the ZSM-5 lattice at a-sites. This form is much stronger, but is still reversible at room temperature."

[5] "DFT modeling of C2H6 adsorption by the isolated Cu1 cations stabilized at the a-site of the ZSM-5 zeolite has shown that the most preferential geometry of adsorption complexes corresponds to interaction with copper of two protons from the same methyl group."

The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts like Cu-ZSM-5 significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations. Specifically:

1. The composition of Cu-ZSM-5, with copper ions exchanged into the zeolite framework, enables high catalytic activity for certain reactions, such as NO decomposition.

2. The structure of the catalyst, particularly the location of Cu+ ions at specific sites (e.g., a-sites) in the ZSM-5 lattice, affects the adsorption and activation of alkanes like ethane.

3. Reaction conditions, including temperature, impact the formation of active copper species. High-temperature treatment with CuCl vapor can directly create copper adsorption centers.

4. The efficiency of alkane transformations is influenced by the strength and nature of adsorption. For ethane on Cu-ZSM-5, two forms of adsorption occur, with the stronger form involving isolated Cu+ ions but remaining reversible at room temperature.

5. The mechanism of alkane activation involves specific interactions between the metal and the adsorbate. For ethane on Cu-ZSM-5, DFT modeling suggests preferential interaction of two protons from the same methyl group with the copper ion.

These factors contribute to the industrial significance of such catalysts by enabling selective and efficient transformations of alkanes under controlled conditions. The ability to tune catalyst properties and understand adsorption mechanisms allows for the development of more effective catalytic processes for various applications.

金属基催化剂(如Cu-ZSM-5)的组成、结构和反应条件显著影响烷烃转化的机理和效率。具体来说:

1. Cu-ZSM-5的组成,即铜离子交换到沸石骨架中,使其对某些反应(如NO分解)具有高催化活性。

2. 催化剂的结构,特别是Cu+离子在ZSM-5晶格中的特定位置(如a位点),影响烷烃(如乙烷)的吸附和活化。

3. 反应条件,包括温度,影响活性铜物种的形成。高温下用CuCl蒸气处理可直接创建铜吸附中心。

4. 烷烃转化的效率受吸附强度和性质的影响。对于Cu-ZSM-5上的乙烷,存在两种吸附形式,其中较强的形式涉及孤立的Cu+离子,但在室温下仍可逆。

5. 烷烃活化机理涉及金属与吸附质之间的特定相互作用。对于Cu-ZSM-5上的乙烷,DFT建模表明同一甲基中的两个质子与铜离子优先相互作用。

这些因素通过在可控条件下实现烷烃的选择性和高效转化,促进了此类催化剂的工业重要性。调整催化剂性质和理解吸附机理的能力,使得开发更有效的催化过程成为可能,适用于各种应用。
