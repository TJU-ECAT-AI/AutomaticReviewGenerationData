[1] "Copper-exchanged ZSM-5 zeolite (CuZSM-5) is known to exhibit a high catalytic activity in the selective decomposition of NO into molecular oxygen and nitrogen."

[2] "The copper adsorption centers could be formed both in an indirect way after reduction of dimeric oxygen-bridged [CuOCu]21 species or directly by high-temperature reaction of the hydrogen form with the CuCl vapour at elevated temperature."

[3] "DRIFT spectra of ethane adsorbed by Cu(I) at relatively high equilibrium pressures. They contain the following DRIFT bands: the strong narrow bands at 2974, 2941, 2920 and 2882 cm1; the very weak band at 2738 cm1; and two weak broad bands with the maxima at 2642 and 2584 cm1."

[4] "Adsorption of C2H6 can take place at the Cu1Z site both in Z1 and Z2 geometries. As proof of the above discussion, Z3 adsorption is not realized, as geometry optimization evolved to the formation of [Cu1(Z2-C2H6)]Z complex."

[5] "The bonding in such [Cu1(Z2-C2H6)]Z complexes could be rationalized by a synergetic combination of ligand-to-metal electron donation from CH s-orbitals to the partially-occupied Cu1 s-orbital combined with metal-to-ligand back-donation from the copper dp-orbitals to CH s* orbitals."

The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations. In the case of Cu-ZSM-5 zeolites:

1. Composition: The catalyst contains copper ions exchanged into the ZSM-5 zeolite framework. The copper can exist in different oxidation states, with Cu(I) being particularly important for alkane interactions.

2. Structure: The ZSM-5 zeolite provides a specific framework structure with defined sites (e.g., α-sites) where copper ions can be stabilized. This influences the accessibility and reactivity of the metal centers.

3. Reaction conditions: High-temperature treatment with CuCl vapor is used to introduce copper into the zeolite framework. The reduction of dimeric oxygen-bridged copper species can also form active copper sites.

4. Mechanism: The interaction between ethane and Cu(I) sites involves the formation of σ-type donor-acceptor complexes. This occurs through a combination of ligand-to-metal electron donation from C-H σ-orbitals to the partially-occupied Cu(I) s-orbital and metal-to-ligand back-donation from copper d-orbitals to C-H σ* orbitals.

5. Efficiency: The formation of these complexes results in significant perturbation of the ethane molecule, as evidenced by large red shifts in C-H stretching frequencies observed in DRIFT spectra.

These factors contribute to the industrial significance of Cu-ZSM-5 catalysts by enabling strong interactions with alkanes without causing dissociation, which can be beneficial for selective transformations. The ability to form stable σ-complexes with alkanes under mild conditions is particularly noteworthy, as it opens up possibilities for controlled alkane activation and transformation.

金属基催化剂的组成、结构和反应条件显著影响烷烃转化的机理和效率。就Cu-ZSM-5沸石而言：

1. 组成：催化剂含有交换到ZSM-5沸石骨架中的铜离子。铜可以以不同的氧化态存在，其中Cu(I)对烷烃相互作用特别重要。

2. 结构：ZSM-5沸石提供了一个特定的骨架结构，具有定义明确的位点（如α位点），铜离子可以在这些位点上稳定下来。这影响了金属中心的可及性和反应活性。

3. 反应条件：高温下用CuCl蒸气处理可将铜引入沸石骨架。还原二聚的氧桥联铜物种也可形成活性铜位点。

4. 机理：乙烷与Cu(I)位点之间的相互作用涉及σ型给体-受体络合物的形成。这是通过C-H σ轨道向部分占据的Cu(I) s轨道的配体到金属电子给予，以及铜d轨道向C-H σ*轨道的金属到配体反馈给予的组合实现的。

5. 效率：这些络合物的形成导致乙烷分子发生显著扰动，这从DRIFT光谱中观察到的C-H伸缩频率的大幅红移可以证明。

这些因素通过使Cu-ZSM-5催化剂能够与烷烃强烈相互作用而不引起解离，为其工业重要性做出贡献，这对选择性转化有利。在温和条件下能够与烷烃形成稳定的σ络合物尤其值得注意，因为它为受控的烷烃活化和转化开辟了可能性。
