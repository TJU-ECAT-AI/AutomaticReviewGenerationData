The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations in processes like oxidative dehydrogenation and zeolite-catalyzed reactions. 

For metal-exchanged zeolites, the study compares zinc- and gallium-modified HZSM-5 catalysts for ethane activation. The composition of the catalyst, specifically whether it contains Zn2+ or Ga1+ cations, leads to distinctly different mechanisms of alkane activation.

The structure of the catalyst plays a crucial role. In Zn/ZSM-5, acid-base pairs formed by separated Zn2+ cations and basic oxygen sites enable strong molecular adsorption and polarizability of ethane even at room temperature. This structural feature facilitates heterolytic dissociative adsorption at moderate temperatures.

Reaction conditions, particularly temperature, significantly affect the activation process. For Zn/ZSM-5, ethane dissociation occurs at moderate temperatures. In contrast, Ga/ZSM-5 requires higher temperatures for dissociative hydrocarbon adsorption.

The efficiency of alkane transformation is influenced by these factors. Zn/ZSM-5 shows higher initial activity but suffers from coking deactivation and secondary aromatization reactions. Ga/ZSM-5, while less active, provides stable and selective conversion of ethane to ethylene.

An important factor contributing to industrial significance is the formation of Brønsted acid sites. In Zn/ZSM-5, ethane dissociation regenerates Brønsted acid protons, leading to aromatics formation and coking. Ga/ZSM-5 does not form these acid sites, resulting in more stable operation and selective ethylene production.

These differences in alkane activation mechanisms have direct consequences for hydrocarbon conversions involving dehydrogenation, highlighting the importance of carefully tailoring catalyst composition, structure, and reaction conditions for specific industrial applications.

金属基催化剂的组成、结构和反应条件显著影响烷烃转化的机理和效率，特别是在氧化脱氢和沸石催化反应等过程中。

对于金属交换沸石，研究比较了锌和镓改性的HZSM-5催化剂在乙烷活化中的表现。催化剂的组成，特别是含有Zn2+还是Ga1+阳离子，导致了明显不同的烷烃活化机理。

催化剂的结构起着关键作用。在Zn/ZSM-5中，由分离的Zn2+阳离子和碱性氧位点形成的酸碱对能够在室温下实现乙烷的强烈分子吸附和极化。这种结构特征有利于在中等温度下进行异裂解离吸附。

反应条件，尤其是温度，显著影响活化过程。对于Zn/ZSM-5，乙烷解离在中等温度下发生。相比之下，Ga/ZSM-5需要更高的温度才能进行解离性碳氢化合物吸附。

这些因素影响了烷烃转化的效率。Zn/ZSM-5显示出更高的初始活性，但受到结焦失活和二次芳构化反应的影响。Ga/ZSM-5虽然活性较低，但提供了稳定和选择性的乙烷到乙烯的转化。

影响工业意义的一个重要因素是Brønsted酸位的形成。在Zn/ZSM-5中，乙烷解离再生Brønsted酸质子，导致芳烃形成和结焦。Ga/ZSM-5不形成这些酸位，从而实现更稳定的操作和选择性乙烯生产。

这些烷烃活化机理的差异对涉及脱氢的碳氢化合物转化有直接影响，突显了为特定工业应用精心调整催化剂组成、结构和反应条件的重要性。
