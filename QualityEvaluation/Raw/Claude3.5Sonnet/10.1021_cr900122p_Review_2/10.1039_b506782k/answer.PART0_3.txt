[1] "Hydrocarbon activation on HZSM-5 modified by bivalent Zn and univalent Ga cations proceeds via two distinctly different mechanisms."

[2] "The stronger molecular adsorption of ethane by the acidbase pairs formed by distantly separated cationic Zn21 and basic oxygen sites results already at room temperature in strong polarizability of adsorbed ethane and subsequent heterolytic dissociative adsorption at moderate temperatures."

[3] "In contrast, molecular adsorption of ethane on Ga1 cations is weak. At high temperatures dissociative hydrocarbon adsorption takes place, resulting in the formation of ethyl and hydride fragments coordinating to the cationic gallium species."

[4] "Whereas in the zinc case a Brnsted acid proton is formed upon ethane dissociation, decomposition of the ethyl fragment on gallium results in gallium dihydride species and does not lead to Brnsted acid protons."

[5] "Zn/ZSM-5 displays a much higher conversion than Ga/ZSM-5. This corresponds to the finding that ethane is more readily activated over the zincoxygen acidbase pairs than over Ga1 cations."

The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations in processes like oxidative dehydrogenation and zeolite-catalyzed reactions. 

For metal-exchanged zeolites, the type of metal cation plays a crucial role. Zinc-modified HZSM-5 and gallium-modified HZSM-5 exhibit distinctly different mechanisms for ethane activation. Zinc forms acid-base pairs with oxygen sites, leading to strong ethane adsorption and polarizability at room temperature, followed by heterolytic dissociative adsorption at moderate temperatures. This results in higher conversion rates and the formation of Brønsted acid protons.

In contrast, gallium cations in Ga/ZSM-5 show weak ethane adsorption at room temperature. Dissociative adsorption occurs only at high temperatures, forming ethyl and hydride fragments coordinated to gallium species. This process does not generate Brønsted acid protons.

The reaction conditions, particularly temperature, also affect the catalytic process. Zn/ZSM-5 activates ethane more readily and at lower temperatures compared to Ga/ZSM-5, resulting in higher conversion rates.

These differences in mechanisms and efficiency contribute to the industrial significance of these catalysts. Zn/ZSM-5 shows higher activity but suffers from coking deactivation and secondary aromatization reactions due to Brønsted acidity generation. Ga/ZSM-5, while less active, offers stable and selective conversion of ethane to ethylene without significant coking or aromatization.

The choice between these catalysts for industrial applications would depend on the desired product distribution and process stability. Zn/ZSM-5 might be preferred for processes targeting aromatic products, while Ga/ZSM-5 could be more suitable for selective ethylene production with longer catalyst lifetimes.

金属基催化剂的组成、结构和反应条件显著影响烷烃转化过程中的机理和效率，特别是在氧化脱氢和沸石催化反应等过程中。

对于金属交换的沸石，金属阳离子的类型起着关键作用。锌改性HZSM-5和镓改性HZSM-5在乙烷活化方面表现出明显不同的机理。锌与氧位点形成酸碱对，导致在室温下强烈吸附和极化乙烷，随后在中等温度下发生异裂解离吸附。这导致更高的转化率和Brønsted酸质子的形成。

相比之下，Ga/ZSM-5中的镓阳离子在室温下对乙烷的吸附较弱。只有在高温下才会发生解离吸附，形成配位到镓物种上的乙基和氢化物片段。这个过程不会产生Brønsted酸质子。

反应条件，特别是温度，也影响催化过程。与Ga/ZSM-5相比，Zn/ZSM-5更容易在较低温度下活化乙烷，从而获得更高的转化率。

这些机理和效率的差异对这些催化剂的工业重要性有所贡献。Zn/ZSM-5显示出更高的活性，但由于Brønsted酸性的产生而遭受积炭失活和次生芳构化反应。Ga/ZSM-5虽然活性较低，但提供了稳定和选择性的乙烷到乙烯的转化，没有明显的积炭或芳构化。

在工业应用中选择这些催化剂将取决于所需的产品分布和过程稳定性。如果目标是芳香族产品，可能会首选Zn/ZSM-5，而如果需要选择性生产乙烯并延长催化剂寿命，Ga/ZSM-5可能更合适。
