[1] "Hydrocarbon activation on HZSM-5 modified by bivalent Zn and univalent Ga cations proceeds via two distinctly different mechanisms."

[2] "The stronger molecular adsorption of ethane by the acidbase pairs formed by distantly separated cationic Zn21 and basic oxygen sites results already at room temperature in strong polarizability of adsorbed ethane and subsequent heterolytic dissociative adsorption at moderate temperatures."

[3] "In contrast, molecular adsorption of ethane on Ga1 cations is weak. At high temperatures dissociative hydrocarbon adsorption takes place, resulting in the formation of ethyl and hydride fragments coordinating to the cationic gallium species."

[4] "Whereas in the zinc case a Brnsted acid proton is formed upon ethane dissociation, decomposition of the ethyl fragment on gallium results in gallium dihydride species and does not lead to Brnsted acid protons."

[5] "This difference in alkane activation has direct consequences for hydrocarbon conversions involving dehydrogenation."

The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations. In the case of Zn/ZSM-5 and Ga/ZSM-5 zeolites, the nature of the metal cations (Zn2+ vs. Ga1+) leads to distinctly different ethane activation mechanisms.

For Zn/ZSM-5, the presence of bivalent Zn2+ cations creates acidbase pairs with basic oxygen sites. This results in strong molecular adsorption and polarizability of ethane even at room temperature, leading to heterolytic dissociative adsorption at moderate temperatures. The process generates Brønsted acid protons, which contribute to secondary reactions like aromatization.

In contrast, Ga/ZSM-5 with univalent Ga1+ cations shows weak molecular adsorption of ethane. Dissociative adsorption occurs only at high temperatures, forming ethyl and hydride fragments coordinated to Ga3+ species. This process does not generate Brønsted acid protons, resulting in a more selective dehydrogenation to ethylene without secondary reactions.

These differences in activation mechanisms directly impact the catalytic performance. Zn/ZSM-5 shows higher initial activity but suffers from coking deactivation and secondary aromatization reactions. Ga/ZSM-5, on the other hand, exhibits more stable and selective conversion of ethane to ethylene.

The industrial significance of these catalysts is related to their ability to activate and transform alkanes, particularly in dehydrogenation processes. The choice between Zn- and Ga-modified zeolites would depend on the desired product distribution and process stability. Zn/ZSM-5 might be preferred for processes where aromatic products are desired, while Ga/ZSM-5 could be more suitable for selective ethylene production.

金属基催化剂的组成、结构和反应条件显著影响烷烃转化的机理和效率。以Zn/ZSM-5和Ga/ZSM-5沸石为例，金属阳离子的性质(Zn2+与Ga1+)导致完全不同的乙烷活化机理。

对于Zn/ZSM-5，二价Zn2+阳离子与碱性氧位形成酸碱对。这导致即使在室温下也能强烈吸附和极化乙烷，在中等温度下引起异裂解离吸附。该过程产生布朗斯特酸质子，促进芳构化等次级反应。

相比之下，含有一价Ga1+阳离子的Ga/ZSM-5对乙烷的分子吸附较弱。只有在高温下才发生解离吸附，形成配位到Ga3+物种的乙基和氢化物片段。这个过程不产生布朗斯特酸质子，从而导致更选择性地脱氢生成乙烯，而不发生次级反应。

这些活化机理的差异直接影响催化性能。Zn/ZSM-5表现出较高的初始活性，但存在积炭失活和次级芳构化反应。而Ga/ZSM-5则表现出更稳定和选择性的乙烷转化为乙烯的过程。

这些催化剂的工业意义在于它们激活和转化烷烃的能力，特别是在脱氢过程中。Zn和Ga改性沸石的选择取决于所需的产品分布和过程稳定性。如果需要芳香族产品，可能会选择Zn/ZSM-5，而Ga/ZSM-5可能更适合选择性乙烯生产。
