          [1] "The activation of ethane over zinc- and gallium-modified HZSM-5 dehydrogenation catalysts was studied by diffuse reflectance infrared spectroscopy."

[2] "Hydrocarbon activation on HZSM-5 modified by bivalent Zn and univalent Ga cations proceeds via two distinctly different mechanisms."

[3] "The stronger molecular adsorption of ethane by the acidbase pairs formed by distantly separated cationic Zn21 and basic oxygen sites results already at room temperature in strong polarizability of adsorbed ethane and subsequent heterolytic dissociative adsorption at moderate temperatures."

[4] "In contrast, molecular adsorption of ethane on Ga1 cations is weak. At high temperatures dissociative hydrocarbon adsorption takes place, resulting in the formation of ethyl and hydride fragments coordinating to the cationic gallium species."

[5] "Whereas in the zinc case a Brnsted acid proton is formed upon ethane dissociation, decomposition of the ethyl fragment on gallium results in gallium dihydride species and does not lead to Brnsted acid protons."

[6] "This difference in alkane activation has direct consequences for hydrocarbon conversions involving dehydrogenation."

[7] "Zn/ZSM-5 displays a much higher conversion than Ga/ZSM-5. This corresponds to the finding that ethane is more readily activated over the zincoxygen acidbase pairs than over Ga1 cations."

          The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations in processes like oxidative dehydrogenation and zeolite-catalyzed reactions. 

For metal-exchanged zeolites, specifically Zn/ZSM-5 and Ga/ZSM-5, the nature of the metal cation plays a crucial role:

1. Composition: 
   - Zn/ZSM-5 contains bivalent Zn2+ cations.
   - Ga/ZSM-5 contains univalent Ga1+ cations.

2. Structure:
   - In Zn/ZSM-5, Zn2+ cations form acid-base pairs with basic oxygen sites in the zeolite framework.
   - In Ga/ZSM-5, Ga1+ cations are present without forming such pairs.

3. Reaction mechanisms:
   - Zn/ZSM-5: Strong molecular adsorption of ethane at room temperature, leading to high polarizability. Heterolytic dissociative adsorption occurs at moderate temperatures, forming zinc-ethyl fragments and Brønsted acid protons.
   - Ga/ZSM-5: Weak ethane adsorption at room temperature. Dissociative adsorption only occurs at high temperatures, forming ethyl and hydride fragments coordinated to gallium species without generating Brønsted acid protons.

4. Efficiency:
   - Zn/ZSM-5 shows higher initial activity and conversion rates.
   - Ga/ZSM-5 exhibits lower activity but more stable and selective conversion of ethane to ethylene.

5. Reaction conditions:
   - Temperature significantly affects the activation process, with Zn/ZSM-5 requiring lower temperatures than Ga/ZSM-5 for ethane activation.

These differences in alkane activation mechanisms directly impact hydrocarbon conversions involving dehydrogenation. The industrial significance of these catalysts relates to their ability to activate and transform alkanes, with the choice between Zn- and Ga-modified zeolites depending on desired product distribution and process stability. Zn/ZSM-5 might be preferred for processes targeting higher conversion rates and aromatic products, while Ga/ZSM-5 could be more suitable for selective ethylene production with improved catalyst stability.

          金属基催化剂的组成、结构和反应条件显著影响烷烃转化的机理和效率，特别是在氧化脱氢和沸石催化反应等过程中。

对于金属交换沸石，特别是Zn/ZSM-5和Ga/ZSM-5，金属阳离子的性质起着关键作用：

1. 组成：
   - Zn/ZSM-5含有二价Zn2+阳离子。
   - Ga/ZSM-5含有一价Ga1+阳离子。

2. 结构：
   - 在Zn/ZSM-5中，Zn2+阳离子与沸石骨架中的碱性氧位点形成酸碱对。
   - 在Ga/ZSM-5中，Ga1+阳离子存在但不形成这种对。

3. 反应机理：
   - Zn/ZSM-5：在室温下强烈吸附乙烷，导致高度极化。在中等温度下发生异裂解离吸附，形成锌-乙基片段和Brønsted酸质子。
   - Ga/ZSM-5：在室温下对乙烷的吸附较弱。只有在高温下才发生解离吸附，形成与镓物种配位的乙基和氢化物片段，不产生Brønsted酸质子。

4. 效率：
   - Zn/ZSM-5显示出较高的初始活性和转化率。
   - Ga/ZSM-5表现出较低的活性，但乙烷到乙烯的转化更稳定和选择性。

5. 反应条件：
   - 温度显著影响活化过程，Zn/ZSM-5需要比Ga/ZSM-5更低的温度来活化乙烷。

这些烷烃活化机理的差异直接影响涉及脱氢的碳氢化合物转化。这些催化剂的工业重要性在于它们活化和转化烷烃的能力，选择Zn或Ga改性沸石取决于所需的产品分布和过程稳定性。如果目标是更高的转化率和芳烃产品，可能会选择Zn/ZSM-5，而如果需要选择性生产乙烯并提高催化剂稳定性，Ga/ZSM-5可能更合适。
