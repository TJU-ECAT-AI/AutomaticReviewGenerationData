The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations in processes like oxidative dehydrogenation and zeolite-catalyzed reactions. 

For metal-exchanged zeolites, the study compares zinc- and gallium-modified HZSM-5 catalysts for ethane activation. The composition of the catalyst, specifically whether it contains Zn2+ or Ga1+ cations, leads to distinctly different mechanisms of alkane activation.

The structure of the catalyst plays a crucial role. In Zn/ZSM-5, acid-base pairs formed by separated Zn2+ cations and basic oxygen sites enable strong molecular adsorption and polarizability of ethane even at room temperature. This structural feature facilitates heterolytic dissociative adsorption at moderate temperatures.

Reaction conditions, particularly temperature, significantly affect the activation process. For Zn/ZSM-5, ethane dissociation occurs at moderate temperatures. In contrast, Ga/ZSM-5 requires higher temperatures for dissociative hydrocarbon adsorption.

The efficiency of alkane transformation is influenced by these factors. Zn/ZSM-5 shows higher initial activity but suffers from coking deactivation and secondary aromatization reactions. Ga/ZSM-5, while less active, provides stable and selective conversion of ethane to ethylene.

An important factor contributing to industrial significance is the formation of Brønsted acid sites. In Zn/ZSM-5, ethane dissociation regenerates Brønsted acid protons, leading to aromatics formation and coking. Ga/ZSM-5 does not form these acid sites, resulting in more stable operation and selective ethylene production.

These differences in alkane activation mechanisms have direct consequences for hydrocarbon conversions involving dehydrogenation, highlighting the importance of carefully tailoring catalyst composition, structure, and reaction conditions for specific industrial applications.

金属基催化剂的组成、结构和反应条件显著影响烷烃转化的机理和效率，特别是在氧化脱氢和沸石催化反应等过程中。

对于金属交换沸石，研究比较了锌和镓改性的HZSM-5催化剂在乙烷活化中的表现。催化剂的组成，特别是含有Zn2+还是Ga1+阳离子，导致了明显不同的烷烃活化机理。

催化剂的结构起着关键作用。在Zn/ZSM-5中，由分离的Zn2+阳离子和碱性氧位点形成的酸碱对能够在室温下实现乙烷的强烈分子吸附和极化。这种结构特征有利于在中等温度下进行异裂解离吸附。

反应条件，尤其是温度，显著影响活化过程。对于Zn/ZSM-5，乙烷解离在中等温度下发生。相比之下，Ga/ZSM-5需要更高的温度才能进行解离性碳氢化合物吸附。

这些因素影响了烷烃转化的效率。Zn/ZSM-5显示出更高的初始活性，但受到结焦失活和二次芳构化反应的影响。Ga/ZSM-5虽然活性较低，但提供了稳定和选择性的乙烷到乙烯的转化。

影响工业意义的一个重要因素是Brønsted酸位的形成。在Zn/ZSM-5中，乙烷解离再生Brønsted酸质子，导致芳烃形成和结焦。Ga/ZSM-5不形成这些酸位，从而实现更稳定的操作和选择性乙烯生产。

这些烷烃活化机理的差异对涉及脱氢的碳氢化合物转化有直接影响，突显了为特定工业应用精心调整催化剂组成、结构和反应条件的重要性。

The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations in processes like oxidative dehydrogenation and zeolite-catalyzed reactions. In the case of metal-exchanged zeolites, the nature of the metal cation plays a crucial role.

For Zn/ZSM-5, the presence of bivalent Zn2+ cations creates acidbase pairs with basic oxygen sites in the zeolite framework. This allows for strong molecular adsorption of ethane even at room temperature, leading to strong polarizability of the adsorbed ethane molecules. Upon heating to moderate temperatures, heterolytic dissociative adsorption occurs, forming zincethyl fragments and Brønsted acid protons.

In contrast, Ga/ZSM-5 with univalent Ga+ cations exhibits weak molecular adsorption of ethane. Dissociative adsorption only occurs at high temperatures, resulting in the formation of ethyl and hydride fragments coordinated to gallium species. Unlike the zinc case, this process does not generate Brønsted acid protons.

These differences in alkane activation mechanisms directly affect the catalytic performance in hydrocarbon conversions. Zn/ZSM-5 shows higher initial activity but suffers from coking deactivation and secondary aromatization reactions due to the generation of Brønsted acidity. On the other hand, Ga/ZSM-5 exhibits more stable and selective conversion of ethane to ethylene, as it does not generate Brønsted acid sites during the reaction.

The industrial significance of these catalysts is influenced by factors such as activity, selectivity, and stability. While Zn/ZSM-5 offers higher conversion rates, its tendency for coke formation and deactivation may limit its long-term industrial use. Ga/ZSM-5, despite lower activity, provides stable ethylene production without significant deactivation, which could be advantageous in certain industrial applications where catalyst longevity and product selectivity are prioritized over high conversion rates.

金属基催化剂的组成、结构和反应条件对烷烃转化的机理和效率有显著影响，尤其是在氧化脱氢和沸石催化反应等过程中。对于金属交换沸石，金属阳离子的性质起着关键作用。

对于Zn/ZSM-5，二价Zn2+阳离子与沸石骨架中的碱性氧原子形成酸碱对。这使得乙烷在室温下就能强烈吸附，导致吸附的乙烷分子具有强烈的极化性。在中等温度下加热时，发生异裂解离吸附，形成锌-乙基片段和Brønsted酸质子。

相比之下，含有一价Ga+阳离子的Ga/ZSM-5对乙烷的分子吸附较弱。只有在高温下才发生解离吸附，形成与镓物种配位的乙基和氢化物片段。与锌的情况不同，这个过程不会产生Brønsted酸质子。

这些烷烃活化机理的差异直接影响了碳氢化合物转化的催化性能。Zn/ZSM-5显示出较高的初始活性，但由于Brønsted酸性的产生，导致结焦失活和二次芳构化反应。另一方面，Ga/ZSM-5表现出更稳定和选择性的乙烷到乙烯的转化，因为在反应过程中不会产生Brønsted酸位。

这些催化剂的工业重要性受到活性、选择性和稳定性等因素的影响。虽然Zn/ZSM-5提供更高的转化率，但其结焦和失活的倾向可能限制其长期工业使用。Ga/ZSM-5尽管活性较低，但能稳定地生产乙烯而不会显著失活，这在某些优先考虑催化剂寿命和产品选择性而非高转化率的工业应用中可能更有优势。

The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations in processes such as oxidative dehydrogenation and zeolite-catalyzed reactions. The study compares zinc- and gallium-modified HZSM-5 zeolites for ethane activation and dehydrogenation.

For Zn/ZSM-5, the catalyst contains bivalent Zn cations that form acid-base pairs with basic oxygen sites in the zeolite framework. This structure allows for strong molecular adsorption of ethane at room temperature, resulting in high polarizability of the adsorbed ethane. Upon moderate heating, heterolytic dissociative adsorption occurs, forming zinc-ethyl fragments and Brønsted acid protons.

In contrast, Ga/ZSM-5 contains univalent Ga cations that weakly adsorb ethane at room temperature. Dissociative adsorption only occurs at high temperatures, forming ethyl and hydride fragments coordinated to gallium species. Unlike the zinc case, this process does not generate Brønsted acid protons.

These differences in activation mechanisms directly affect the catalytic performance. Zn/ZSM-5 shows higher initial activity but suffers from coking deactivation and secondary aromatization reactions due to the generation of Brønsted acidity. Ga/ZSM-5, on the other hand, exhibits more stable and selective conversion of ethane to ethylene without significant side reactions or deactivation.

The industrial significance of these catalysts is related to their ability to activate and transform alkanes, particularly in dehydrogenation processes. The choice between zinc- and gallium-modified zeolites would depend on the desired product distribution and process stability. Zn/ZSM-5 may be preferred for processes where higher conversion and aromatic products are desired, while Ga/ZSM-5 could be more suitable for selective ethylene production with improved catalyst stability.

这些催化剂的工业意义在于它们活化和转化烷烃的能力，特别是在脱氢过程中。锌改性和镓改性沸石的选择将取决于所需的产品分布和过程稳定性。如果需要更高的转化率和芳烃产品，可能会选择Zn/ZSM-5，而如果需要选择性乙烯生产和改善的催化剂稳定性，Ga/ZSM-5可能更合适。

The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations in processes like oxidative dehydrogenation and zeolite-catalyzed reactions. 

For metal-exchanged zeolites, the type of metal cation plays a crucial role. Zinc-modified HZSM-5 and gallium-modified HZSM-5 exhibit distinctly different mechanisms for ethane activation. Zinc forms acid-base pairs with oxygen sites, leading to strong ethane adsorption and polarizability at room temperature, followed by heterolytic dissociative adsorption at moderate temperatures. This results in higher conversion rates and the formation of Brønsted acid protons.

In contrast, gallium cations in Ga/ZSM-5 show weak ethane adsorption at room temperature. Dissociative adsorption occurs only at high temperatures, forming ethyl and hydride fragments coordinated to gallium species. This process does not generate Brønsted acid protons.

The reaction conditions, particularly temperature, also affect the catalytic process. Zn/ZSM-5 activates ethane more readily and at lower temperatures compared to Ga/ZSM-5, resulting in higher conversion rates.

These differences in mechanisms and efficiency contribute to the industrial significance of these catalysts. Zn/ZSM-5 shows higher activity but suffers from coking deactivation and secondary aromatization reactions due to Brønsted acidity generation. Ga/ZSM-5, while less active, offers stable and selective conversion of ethane to ethylene without significant coking or aromatization.

The choice between these catalysts for industrial applications would depend on the desired product distribution and process stability. Zn/ZSM-5 might be preferred for processes targeting aromatic products, while Ga/ZSM-5 could be more suitable for selective ethylene production with longer catalyst lifetimes.

反应条件，特别是温度，也影响催化过程。与Ga/ZSM-5相比，Zn/ZSM-5更容易在较低温度下活化乙烷，从而获得更高的转化率。

这些机理和效率的差异对这些催化剂的工业重要性有所贡献。Zn/ZSM-5显示出更高的活性，但由于Brønsted酸性的产生而遭受积炭失活和次生芳构化反应。Ga/ZSM-5虽然活性较低，但提供了稳定和选择性的乙烷到乙烯的转化，没有明显的积炭或芳构化。

在工业应用中选择这些催化剂将取决于所需的产品分布和过程稳定性。如果目标是芳香族产品，可能会首选Zn/ZSM-5，而如果需要选择性生产乙烯并延长催化剂寿命，Ga/ZSM-5可能更合适。

The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations. In the case of Zn/ZSM-5 and Ga/ZSM-5 zeolites, the nature of the metal cations (Zn2+ vs. Ga1+) leads to distinctly different ethane activation mechanisms.

For Zn/ZSM-5, the presence of bivalent Zn2+ cations creates acidbase pairs with basic oxygen sites. This results in strong molecular adsorption and polarizability of ethane even at room temperature, leading to heterolytic dissociative adsorption at moderate temperatures. The process generates Brønsted acid protons, which contribute to secondary reactions like aromatization.

In contrast, Ga/ZSM-5 with univalent Ga1+ cations shows weak molecular adsorption of ethane. Dissociative adsorption occurs only at high temperatures, forming ethyl and hydride fragments coordinated to Ga3+ species. This process does not generate Brønsted acid protons, resulting in a more selective dehydrogenation to ethylene without secondary reactions.

These differences in activation mechanisms directly impact the catalytic performance. Zn/ZSM-5 shows higher initial activity but suffers from coking deactivation and secondary aromatization reactions. Ga/ZSM-5, on the other hand, exhibits more stable and selective conversion of ethane to ethylene.
