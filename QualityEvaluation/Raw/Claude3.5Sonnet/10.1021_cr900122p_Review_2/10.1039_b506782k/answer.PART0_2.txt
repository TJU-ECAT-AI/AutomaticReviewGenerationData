The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations in processes such as oxidative dehydrogenation and zeolite-catalyzed reactions. The study compares zinc- and gallium-modified HZSM-5 zeolites for ethane activation and dehydrogenation.

For Zn/ZSM-5, the catalyst contains bivalent Zn cations that form acid-base pairs with basic oxygen sites in the zeolite framework. This structure allows for strong molecular adsorption of ethane at room temperature, resulting in high polarizability of the adsorbed ethane. Upon moderate heating, heterolytic dissociative adsorption occurs, forming zinc-ethyl fragments and Brønsted acid protons.

In contrast, Ga/ZSM-5 contains univalent Ga cations that weakly adsorb ethane at room temperature. Dissociative adsorption only occurs at high temperatures, forming ethyl and hydride fragments coordinated to gallium species. Unlike the zinc case, this process does not generate Brønsted acid protons.

These differences in activation mechanisms directly affect the catalytic performance. Zn/ZSM-5 shows higher initial activity but suffers from coking deactivation and secondary aromatization reactions due to the generation of Brønsted acidity. Ga/ZSM-5, on the other hand, exhibits more stable and selective conversion of ethane to ethylene without significant side reactions or deactivation.

The industrial significance of these catalysts is related to their ability to activate and transform alkanes, particularly in dehydrogenation processes. The choice between zinc- and gallium-modified zeolites would depend on the desired product distribution and process stability. Zn/ZSM-5 may be preferred for processes where higher conversion and aromatic products are desired, while Ga/ZSM-5 could be more suitable for selective ethylene production with improved catalyst stability.

金属基催化剂的组成、结构和反应条件显著影响烷烃转化的机理和效率，特别是在氧化脱氢和沸石催化反应等过程中。该研究比较了锌改性和镓改性的HZSM-5沸石在乙烷活化和脱氢方面的性能。

对于Zn/ZSM-5，催化剂含有二价锌阳离子，与沸石骨架中的碱性氧位点形成酸碱对。这种结构允许在室温下强烈吸附乙烷，导致吸附乙烷的高度极化。在中等温度下，发生异裂解离吸附，形成锌-乙基片段和布朗斯特酸质子。

相比之下，Ga/ZSM-5含有一价镓阳离子，在室温下对乙烷的吸附较弱。只有在高温下才会发生解离吸附，形成与镓物种配位的乙基和氢化物片段。与锌的情况不同，这个过程不会产生布朗斯特酸质子。

这些活化机理的差异直接影响催化性能。Zn/ZSM-5显示出较高的初始活性，但由于产生布朗斯特酸性而导致结焦失活和芳构化副反应。另一方面，Ga/ZSM-5表现出更稳定和选择性的乙烷到乙烯转化，没有明显的副反应或失活。

这些催化剂的工业意义在于它们活化和转化烷烃的能力，特别是在脱氢过程中。锌改性和镓改性沸石的选择将取决于所需的产品分布和过程稳定性。如果需要更高的转化率和芳烃产品，可能会选择Zn/ZSM-5，而如果需要选择性乙烯生产和改善的催化剂稳定性，Ga/ZSM-5可能更合适。
