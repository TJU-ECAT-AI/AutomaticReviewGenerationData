[1] "Hydrocarbon activation on HZSM-5 modified by bivalent Zn and univalent Ga cations proceeds via two distinctly different mechanisms."

[2] "The stronger molecular adsorption of ethane by the acidbase pairs formed by distantly separated cationic Zn21 and basic oxygen sites results already at room temperature in strong polarizability of adsorbed ethane and subsequent heterolytic dissociative adsorption at moderate temperatures."

[3] "In contrast, molecular adsorption of ethane on Ga1 cations is weak. At high temperatures dissociative hydrocarbon adsorption takes place, resulting in the formation of ethyl and hydride fragments coordinating to the cationic gallium species."

[4] "Whereas in the zinc case a Brnsted acid proton is formed upon ethane dissociation, decomposition of the ethyl fragment on gallium results in gallium dihydride species and does not lead to Brnsted acid protons."

[5] "This difference in alkane activation has direct consequences for hydrocarbon conversions involving dehydrogenation."

The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations in processes like oxidative dehydrogenation and zeolite-catalyzed reactions. In the case of metal-exchanged zeolites, the nature of the metal cation plays a crucial role.

For Zn/ZSM-5, the presence of bivalent Zn2+ cations creates acidbase pairs with basic oxygen sites in the zeolite framework. This allows for strong molecular adsorption of ethane even at room temperature, leading to strong polarizability of the adsorbed ethane molecules. Upon heating to moderate temperatures, heterolytic dissociative adsorption occurs, forming zincethyl fragments and Brønsted acid protons.

In contrast, Ga/ZSM-5 with univalent Ga+ cations exhibits weak molecular adsorption of ethane. Dissociative adsorption only occurs at high temperatures, resulting in the formation of ethyl and hydride fragments coordinated to gallium species. Unlike the zinc case, this process does not generate Brønsted acid protons.

These differences in alkane activation mechanisms directly affect the catalytic performance in hydrocarbon conversions. Zn/ZSM-5 shows higher initial activity but suffers from coking deactivation and secondary aromatization reactions due to the generation of Brønsted acidity. On the other hand, Ga/ZSM-5 exhibits more stable and selective conversion of ethane to ethylene, as it does not generate Brønsted acid sites during the reaction.

The industrial significance of these catalysts is influenced by factors such as activity, selectivity, and stability. While Zn/ZSM-5 offers higher conversion rates, its tendency for coke formation and deactivation may limit its long-term industrial use. Ga/ZSM-5, despite lower activity, provides stable ethylene production without significant deactivation, which could be advantageous in certain industrial applications where catalyst longevity and product selectivity are prioritized over high conversion rates.

金属基催化剂的组成、结构和反应条件对烷烃转化的机理和效率有显著影响，尤其是在氧化脱氢和沸石催化反应等过程中。对于金属交换沸石，金属阳离子的性质起着关键作用。

对于Zn/ZSM-5，二价Zn2+阳离子与沸石骨架中的碱性氧原子形成酸碱对。这使得乙烷在室温下就能强烈吸附，导致吸附的乙烷分子具有强烈的极化性。在中等温度下加热时，发生异裂解离吸附，形成锌-乙基片段和Brønsted酸质子。

相比之下，含有一价Ga+阳离子的Ga/ZSM-5对乙烷的分子吸附较弱。只有在高温下才发生解离吸附，形成与镓物种配位的乙基和氢化物片段。与锌的情况不同，这个过程不会产生Brønsted酸质子。

这些烷烃活化机理的差异直接影响了碳氢化合物转化的催化性能。Zn/ZSM-5显示出较高的初始活性，但由于Brønsted酸性的产生，导致结焦失活和二次芳构化反应。另一方面，Ga/ZSM-5表现出更稳定和选择性的乙烷到乙烯的转化，因为在反应过程中不会产生Brønsted酸位。

这些催化剂的工业重要性受到活性、选择性和稳定性等因素的影响。虽然Zn/ZSM-5提供更高的转化率，但其结焦和失活的倾向可能限制其长期工业使用。Ga/ZSM-5尽管活性较低，但能稳定地生产乙烯而不会显著失活，这在某些优先考虑催化剂寿命和产品选择性而非高转化率的工业应用中可能更有优势。
