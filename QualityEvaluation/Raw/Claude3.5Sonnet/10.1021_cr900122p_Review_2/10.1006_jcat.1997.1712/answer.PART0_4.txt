[1] "The dehydroaromatization of methane to benzene has been investigated over a 2 wt% Mo/ZSM-5 catalyst in the absence of an added oxidant."

[2] "Pretreatment of the catalyst in a CH4/H2 gas mixture at 700C reduces Mo6+ ions in the calcined catalyst into Mo2C and almost eliminates the induction period, confirming that Mo2C is the active species in the activation of methane."

[3] "During preparation and/or pretreatment of the catalyst, a portion of the Mo ions diffuses into the channels of the zeolite. The amount of Mo ions within the channels depends on the temperature, time, and atmosphere of calcination."

[4] "It appears that the dispersion of molybdenum oxide species on the surface of ZSM-5 may occur slowly and/or may be restricted to a short distance."

[5] "The presence of a certain concentration of acid sites in Mo/ZSM-5 catalysts is thus necessary to achieve a high benzene selectivity and a high methane conversion, since the formation of aromatics is thermodynamically favored."

The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations. For Mo/ZSM-5 catalysts in methane dehydroaromatization:

1. Composition: A 2 wt% Mo loading on ZSM-5 is effective for methane conversion to benzene.

2. Structure: Mo species are initially present as small crystallites on the external surface of ZSM-5. Upon calcination, Mo becomes more dispersed on the surface and partially diffuses into the zeolite channels. The distribution of Mo affects catalyst performance.

3. Reaction conditions: Pretreatment in CH4/H2 at 700°C reduces Mo6+ to Mo2C, which is the active species for methane activation. This pretreatment eliminates the induction period and improves catalyst efficiency.

4. Acid sites: The presence of acid sites in the zeolite is crucial for achieving high benzene selectivity and methane conversion.

5. Calcination conditions: Temperature, time, and atmosphere affect Mo distribution and catalyst performance.

These factors contribute to the industrial significance of Mo/ZSM-5 catalysts by influencing their activity, selectivity, and stability in methane dehydroaromatization. The ability to control Mo distribution and oxidation state through preparation and pretreatment conditions allows for optimization of catalyst performance for industrial applications.

金属基催化剂的组成、结构和反应条件显著影响烷烃转化的机理和效率。对于Mo/ZSM-5催化剂在甲烷脱氢芳构化中：

1. 组成：2 wt%的Mo负载在ZSM-5上对甲烷转化为苯很有效。

2. 结构：Mo物种最初以小晶体形式存在于ZSM-5的外表面。煅烧后，Mo在表面上分散度更高，并部分扩散到沸石孔道中。Mo的分布影响催化剂性能。

3. 反应条件：在700°C下用CH4/H2预处理可将Mo6+还原为Mo2C，这是甲烷活化的活性物种。这种预处理消除了诱导期并提高了催化剂效率。

4. 酸性位点：沸石中酸性位点的存在对实现高苯选择性和甲烷转化率至关重要。

5. 煅烧条件：温度、时间和气氛影响Mo的分布和催化剂性能。

这些因素通过影响Mo/ZSM-5催化剂在甲烷脱氢芳构化中的活性、选择性和稳定性，对其工业重要性做出贡献。通过制备和预处理条件控制Mo分布和氧化态的能力，可以优化催化剂性能以满足工业应用需求。
