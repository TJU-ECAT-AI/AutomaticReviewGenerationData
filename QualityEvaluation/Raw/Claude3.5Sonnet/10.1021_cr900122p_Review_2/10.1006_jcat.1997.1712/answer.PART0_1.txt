[1] "Direct conversion of methane to higher hydrocarbons, particularly to aromatics such as benzene, toluene, and naphthalene, in the absence of gas-phase oxygen has received considerable recent attention."

[2] "Several recent studies of methane conversion to aromatics have been carried out over MoO3/ZSM-5 catalysts in flow reactors."

[3] "Chen and co-workers (12) carried out X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), electron spin resonance, and temperature-programmed reduction measurements of fresh and used Mo/ZSM-5 catalysts and concluded that methane was activated to form CH3· radicals via a synergistic action between MoOx and Brnsted acidic sites"

[4] "Exposure of a calcined Mo/ZSM-5 catalyst to CH4 at 700C causes reduction of molybdenum ions to the carbide,Mo2C,whichwasidentifiedbyXPS."

[5] "Based on characterizations by XRD, acidity and catalytic activity for Brnsted acid-catalyzed reactions, Valyon and Meszaros-Kis (19) suggested that Mo in a conventionally prepared Mo-impregnated HZSM-5 sample is located primarily on the external zeolite surface"

The literature focuses primarily on Mo/ZSM-5 catalysts for methane conversion to aromatics, rather than vanadium oxides or other metal-exchanged zeolites for alkane transformations. However, some insights can be drawn about how composition, structure, and reaction conditions influence catalytic mechanisms and efficiency:

1. Catalyst composition: The active species for methane activation is Mo2C, formed by reduction of Mo6+ ions under reaction conditions. The presence of both Mo species and Brønsted acid sites in the zeolite is important for the overall reaction.

2. Catalyst structure: The distribution of Mo species between the external surface and internal channels of the zeolite affects catalytic performance. Higher dispersion and some diffusion into channels occurs at higher calcination temperatures.

3. Reaction conditions: Temperature plays a crucial role, with 700°C typically used for Mo2C formation and methane activation. The absence of gas-phase oxygen is notable for this particular reaction.

4. Mechanism: Methane is activated on Mo2C sites to form methyl radicals, which then undergo further reactions on acid sites to form aromatics.

5. Efficiency: Benzene selectivities of 60-70% at methane conversions of 4-8% are reported, indicating moderate efficiency.

The industrial significance of this specific catalyst system is not directly addressed, but the direct conversion of methane to higher-value aromatics without an oxidant is of considerable interest for natural gas utilization.

文献主要集中在Mo/ZSM-5催化剂上用于甲烷转化为芳烃，而不是钒氧化物或其他金属交换沸石用于烷烃转化。然而，我们可以得出一些关于组成、结构和反应条件如何影响催化机理和效率的见解：

1. 催化剂组成：甲烷活化的活性物种是Mo2C，由Mo6+离子在反应条件下还原形成。沸石中Mo物种和Brønsted酸性位点的存在对整个反应都很重要。

2. 催化剂结构：Mo物种在沸石外表面和内部通道之间的分布影响催化性能。在更高的煅烧温度下，分散度更高，并且有一些扩散到通道内。

3. 反应条件：温度起着关键作用，通常使用700°C形成Mo2C和活化甲烷。值得注意的是，这种特定反应不需要气相氧。

4. 机理：甲烷在Mo2C位点上被活化形成甲基自由基，然后在酸性位点上进一步反应形成芳烃。

5. 效率：报告的苯选择性为60-70%，甲烷转化率为4-8%，表明效率适中。

文献并未直接讨论这种特定催化剂系统的工业重要性，但是在没有氧化剂的情况下直接将甲烷转化为高附加值芳烃对天然气利用具有相当大的意义。
