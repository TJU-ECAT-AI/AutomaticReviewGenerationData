[1] "Dehydroxylation of the Brnsted OH groups at 3611 cm1 becomes significant only after heating at 900C; even at this temperature, however, hydroxyl removal is not complete after heating the sample for 9 h."

[2] "Exposure of a 2 wt% Mo/ZSM-5 catalyst to CH4 or to CH4/H2 at 700C causes reduction of Mo ions to Mo2C, rather than to metallic Mo. About 60 to 80% of Mo species are present in the form of Mo2C after the reaction reaches steady state, but part of the Mo (2030%) remains present as Mo4+ and Mo5+ and is not reduced even when the catalyst is treated in CH4 or CH4/H2 at 700C for many hours."

[3] "The formation of Mo2C corresponds well with the time of the initial activation period for the production of benzene, indicating that carbidic molybdenum species are the active centers for the activation of methane."

[4] "Since preformation of Mo2C on the catalyst, without coke deposition, does not completely eliminate the induction period, it is believed that the clean surface of Mo2C may be too reactive to form higher hydrocarbons and, thus, that a coke-modified Mo2C surface may be the actual active species in the formation of ethylene as the reaction intermediate."

The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts, particularly Mo/ZSM-5, significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations, especially in the conversion of methane to benzene. The key factors contributing to their industrial significance include:

1. Catalyst composition: The presence of Mo species on ZSM-5 zeolite support is crucial for methane activation. The reduction of Mo ions to Mo2C under reaction conditions plays a vital role in the catalytic process.

2. Catalyst structure: The distribution of Mo species on the external surface and within the zeolite channels affects the catalyst's performance. Calcination temperature and duration influence this distribution.

3. Reaction conditions: The temperature (700°C) and gas composition (CH4 or CH4/H2) are critical for the formation of the active Mo2C species. 

4. Active site formation: The reduction of Mo ions to Mo2C corresponds to the initial activation period for benzene production, indicating that carbidic molybdenum species are the active centers for methane activation.

5. Surface modification: A coke-modified Mo2C surface appears to be the actual active species for the formation of ethylene as a reaction intermediate, as the clean Mo2C surface may be too reactive.

6. Stability of acid sites: The presence of Brønsted acid sites in the zeolite, which remain stable at high temperatures, is essential for the conversion of primary products (e.g., ethylene) to aromatics like benzene.

These factors contribute to the industrial significance of Mo/ZSM-5 catalysts by enabling the direct conversion of methane to valuable aromatic compounds under non-oxidative conditions, potentially offering a more efficient route for natural gas utilization.

金属基催化剂，特别是Mo/ZSM-5的组成、结构和反应条件显著影响烷烃转化的机理和效率，尤其是在甲烷转化为苯的过程中。对其工业重要性有贡献的关键因素包括：

1. 催化剂组成：Mo物种在ZSM-5分子筛载体上的存在对甲烷活化至关重要。在反应条件下Mo离子还原为Mo2C在催化过程中起着关键作用。

2. 催化剂结构：Mo物种在外表面和分子筛孔道内的分布影响催化剂的性能。煅烧温度和持续时间影响这种分布。

3. 反应条件：温度（700°C）和气体组成（CH4或CH4/H2）对形成活性Mo2C物种至关重要。

4. 活性位点形成：Mo离子还原为Mo2C与苯生产的初始活化期相对应，表明碳化钼物种是甲烷活化的活性中心。

5. 表面修饰：经焦炭修饰的Mo2C表面似乎是形成乙烯作为反应中间体的实际活性物种，因为干净的Mo2C表面可能反应性太强。

6. 酸性位点的稳定性：分子筛中布朗斯特酸性位点的存在，在高温下保持稳定，对于将初级产物（如乙烯）转化为苯等芳烃至关重要。

这些因素通过在非氧化条件下实现甲烷直接转化为有价值的芳烃化合物，为Mo/ZSM-5催化剂的工业重要性做出贡献，可能为天然气利用提供更高效的途径。
