[1] "The dehydroaromatization of methane to benzene has been investigated over a 2 wt% Mo/ZSM-5 catalyst in the absence of an added oxidant."

[2] "Under typical CH4 reaction conditions at 700C, 60–80% of the original Mo6+ ions are reduced to form Mo2C, with the remaining Mo occurring primarily as Mo4+ and traces of Mo5+ ions."

[3] "Following an initial activation period during the first 2 h of reaction, a benzene selectivity of 60 to 65% at a CH4 conversion of 4 to 8% was achieved over the sample calcined in O2."

[4] "Exposure of a 2 wt% Mo/ZSM-5 catalyst to CH4 or to CH4/H2 at 700C causes reduction of Mo ions to Mo2C, rather than to metallic Mo."

[5] "Since preformation of Mo2C on the catalyst, without coke deposition, does not completely eliminate the induction period, it is believed that the clean surface of Mo2C may be too reactive to form higher hydrocarbons and, thus, that a coke-modified Mo2C surface may be the actual active species in the formation of ethylene as the reaction intermediate."

The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts, particularly Mo/ZSM-5, significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations, specifically in the dehydroaromatization of methane to benzene. 

The catalyst composition of 2 wt% Mo on ZSM-5 zeolite support plays a crucial role. The structure of the catalyst evolves during the reaction, with Mo6+ ions being reduced to form Mo2C (60-80%) and some Mo4+ and Mo5+ species. This transformation is key to the catalyst's activity.

Reaction conditions, particularly temperature (700°C) and the absence of added oxidants, are critical. These conditions promote the reduction of Mo species and the formation of the active Mo2C phase.

The mechanism involves an initial activation period, during which the catalyst structure changes and coke deposition occurs. This leads to the formation of a coke-modified Mo2C surface, which is believed to be the actual active species for forming ethylene as a reaction intermediate.

The efficiency of the process is reflected in the benzene selectivity of 60-65% at a CH4 conversion of 4-8% after the activation period. This demonstrates the catalyst's ability to selectively transform methane into valuable aromatic compounds.

While this specific example focuses on methane dehydroaromatization, it illustrates the complex interplay between catalyst composition, structure, and reaction conditions in alkane transformations. The industrial significance of such processes lies in their potential to convert abundant natural gas (primarily methane) into more valuable chemical products, although the relatively low conversion rates suggest that further optimization would be needed for practical applications.

金属基催化剂的组成、结构和反应条件，特别是Mo/ZSM-5，显著影响烷烃转化的机理和效率，尤其是在甲烷脱氢芳构化为苯的过程中。

催化剂组成为2 wt% Mo负载在ZSM-5分子筛载体上，这一组成起着关键作用。在反应过程中，催化剂的结构发生演变，Mo6+离子被还原形成Mo2C（60-80%）以及一些Mo4+和Mo5+物种。这种转变对催化剂的活性至关重要。

反应条件，特别是温度（700°C）和无添加氧化剂，是至关重要的。这些条件促进了Mo物种的还原和活性Mo2C相的形成。

反应机理涉及一个初始活化期，在此期间催化剂结构发生变化并发生积碳。这导致形成了一个被认为是实际活性物种的积碳修饰Mo2C表面，用于形成乙烯作为反应中间体。

该过程的效率体现在活化期后苯的选择性为60-65%，甲烷转化率为4-8%。这表明了催化剂将甲烷选择性转化为有价值的芳香族化合物的能力。

虽然这个具体例子集中在甲烷脱氢芳构化上，但它说明了催化剂组成、结构和反应条件在烷烃转化中的复杂相互作用。这类过程的工业意义在于它们有潜力将丰富的天然气（主要是甲烷）转化为更有价值的化学产品，尽管相对较低的转化率表明，要实现实际应用还需要进一步优化。
