[1] "The dehydroaromatization of methane to benzene has been investigated over a 2 wt% Mo/ZSM-5 catalyst in the absence of an added oxidant."

[2] "Pretreatment of the catalyst in a CH4/H2 gas mixture at 700C reduces Mo6+ ions in the calcined catalyst into Mo2C and almost eliminates the induction period, confirming that Mo2C is the active species in the activation of methane."

[3] "Under typical CH4 reaction conditions at 700C, 60–80% of the original Mo6+ ions are reduced to form Mo2C, with the remaining Mo occurring primarily as Mo4+ and traces of Mo5+ ions."

[4] "These results clearly demonstrate that Mo2C, and not metallic molybdenum, is formed under CH4 reaction conditions at 700C and, furthermore, that the carbide is most likely the active species for the activation of methane and formation of ethylene as the primary reaction intermediate"

[5] "The presence of a certain concentration of acid sites in Mo/ZSM-5 catalysts is thus necessary to achieve a high benzene selectivity and a high methane conversion, since the formation of aromatics is thermodynamically favored"

The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations. For the specific case of methane dehydroaromatization to benzene, a 2 wt% Mo/ZSM-5 catalyst is used. The active species for methane activation is Mo2C, formed by reduction of Mo6+ ions under reaction conditions at 700°C. 

The structure of the catalyst involves Mo species dispersed on the external surface and within the channels of the ZSM-5 zeolite. The reaction conditions, particularly the high temperature of 700°C and the absence of added oxidants, promote the formation of Mo2C from the original Mo6+ ions. 

The efficiency of the transformation is influenced by several factors:

1. Pretreatment: Pretreatment in a CH4/H2 gas mixture at 700°C reduces the induction period by forming Mo2C prior to the reaction.

2. Degree of reduction: Under typical reaction conditions, 60-80% of Mo6+ ions are reduced to Mo2C, with the remaining Mo present as Mo4+ and Mo5+.

3. Acid sites: The presence of acid sites in the ZSM-5 zeolite is necessary for high benzene selectivity and methane conversion.

4. Coke formation: A coke-modified Mo2C surface may be the actual active species for forming ethylene as an intermediate.

The industrial significance of this process lies in its potential for direct conversion of methane to higher-value aromatic compounds like benzene, without the need for synthesis gas as an intermediate. However, the high temperature required and the tendency for coke formation may present challenges for large-scale application.

金属基催化剂的组成、结构和反应条件显著影响烷烃转化的机理和效率。对于甲烷脱氢芳构化生成苯的特定情况，使用了2 wt% Mo/ZSM-5催化剂。甲烷活化的活性物种是Mo2C，在700°C的反应条件下由Mo6+离子还原而成。

催化剂的结构涉及分散在ZSM-5分子筛外表面和孔道内的Mo物种。反应条件，特别是700°C的高温和无添加氧化剂，促进了原始Mo6+离子形成Mo2C。

转化效率受几个因素影响：

1. 预处理：在700°C下用CH4/H2气体混合物预处理可以通过在反应前形成Mo2C来缩短诱导期。

2. 还原程度：在典型反应条件下，60-80%的Mo6+离子被还原为Mo2C，剩余的Mo以Mo4+和Mo5+的形式存在。

3. 酸性位点：ZSM-5分子筛中酸性位点的存在对于获得高苯选择性和甲烷转化率是必要的。

4. 积炭形成：积炭改性的Mo2C表面可能是形成乙烯中间体的实际活性物种。

这个过程的工业意义在于它可以直接将甲烷转化为苯等更高价值的芳香族化合物，而不需要合成气作为中间体。然而，所需的高温和积炭倾向可能会给大规模应用带来挑战。
