[1] "Dehydroxylation of the Brnsted OH groups at 3611 cm1 becomes significant only after heating at 900C; even at this temperature, however, hydroxyl removal is not complete after heating the sample for 9 h."

[2] "Exposure of a 2 wt% Mo/ZSM-5 catalyst to CH4 or to CH4/H2 at 700C causes reduction of Mo ions to Mo2C, rather than to metallic Mo. About 60 to 80% of Mo species are present in the form of Mo2C after the reaction reaches steady state, but part of the Mo (2030%) remains present as Mo4+ and Mo5+ and is not reduced even when the catalyst is treated in CH4 or CH4/H2 at 700C for many hours."

[3] "The formation of Mo2C corresponds well with the time of the initial activation period for the production of benzene, indicating that carbidic molybdenum species are the active centers for the activation of methane."

[4] "Since preformation of Mo2C on the catalyst, without coke deposition, does not completely eliminate the induction period, it is believed that the clean surface of Mo2C may be too reactive to form higher hydrocarbons and, thus, that a coke-modified Mo2C surface may be the actual active species in the formation of ethylene as the reaction intermediate."

The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts, particularly Mo/ZSM-5, significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations, especially in the conversion of methane to benzene. The key factors contributing to their industrial significance include:

1. Catalyst composition: The presence of Mo species on ZSM-5 zeolite support is crucial for methane activation. The reduction of Mo ions to Mo2C under reaction conditions plays a vital role in the catalytic process.

2. Catalyst structure: The distribution of Mo species on the external surface and within the zeolite channels affects the catalyst's performance. Calcination temperature and duration influence this distribution.

3. Reaction conditions: The temperature (700°C) and gas composition (CH4 or CH4/H2) are critical for the formation of the active Mo2C species. 

4. Active site formation: The reduction of Mo ions to Mo2C corresponds to the initial activation period for benzene production, indicating that carbidic molybdenum species are the active centers for methane activation.

5. Surface modification: A coke-modified Mo2C surface appears to be the actual active species for the formation of ethylene as a reaction intermediate, as the clean Mo2C surface may be too reactive.

6. Stability of acid sites: The presence of Brønsted acid sites in the zeolite, which remain stable at high temperatures, is essential for the conversion of primary products (e.g., ethylene) to aromatics like benzene.

These factors contribute to the industrial significance of Mo/ZSM-5 catalysts by enabling the direct conversion of methane to valuable aromatic compounds under non-oxidative conditions, potentially offering a more efficient route for natural gas utilization.

金属基催化剂，特别是Mo/ZSM-5的组成、结构和反应条件显著影响烷烃转化的机理和效率，尤其是在甲烷转化为苯的过程中。对其工业重要性有贡献的关键因素包括：

1. 催化剂组成：Mo物种在ZSM-5分子筛载体上的存在对甲烷活化至关重要。在反应条件下Mo离子还原为Mo2C在催化过程中起着关键作用。

2. 催化剂结构：Mo物种在外表面和分子筛孔道内的分布影响催化剂的性能。煅烧温度和持续时间影响这种分布。

3. 反应条件：温度（700°C）和气体组成（CH4或CH4/H2）对形成活性Mo2C物种至关重要。

4. 活性位点形成：Mo离子还原为Mo2C与苯生产的初始活化期相对应，表明碳化钼物种是甲烷活化的活性中心。

5. 表面修饰：经焦炭修饰的Mo2C表面似乎是形成乙烯作为反应中间体的实际活性物种，因为干净的Mo2C表面可能反应性太强。

6. 酸性位点的稳定性：分子筛中布朗斯特酸性位点的存在，在高温下保持稳定，对于将初级产物（如乙烯）转化为苯等芳烃至关重要。

这些因素通过在非氧化条件下实现甲烷直接转化为有价值的芳烃化合物，为Mo/ZSM-5催化剂的工业重要性做出贡献，可能为天然气利用提供更高效的途径。

[1] "Direct conversion of methane to higher hydrocarbons, particularly to aromatics such as benzene, toluene, and naphthalene, in the absence of gas-phase oxygen has received considerable recent attention."

[2] "Several recent studies of methane conversion to aromatics have been carried out over MoO3/ZSM-5 catalysts in flow reactors."

[3] "Chen and co-workers (12) carried out X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), electron spin resonance, and temperature-programmed reduction measurements of fresh and used Mo/ZSM-5 catalysts and concluded that methane was activated to form CH3· radicals via a synergistic action between MoOx and Brnsted acidic sites"

[4] "Exposure of a calcined Mo/ZSM-5 catalyst to CH4 at 700C causes reduction of molybdenum ions to the carbide,Mo2C,whichwasidentifiedbyXPS."

[5] "Based on characterizations by XRD, acidity and catalytic activity for Brnsted acid-catalyzed reactions, Valyon and Meszaros-Kis (19) suggested that Mo in a conventionally prepared Mo-impregnated HZSM-5 sample is located primarily on the external zeolite surface"

The literature focuses primarily on Mo/ZSM-5 catalysts for methane conversion to aromatics, rather than vanadium oxides or other metal-exchanged zeolites for alkane transformations. However, some insights can be drawn about how composition, structure, and reaction conditions influence catalytic mechanisms and efficiency:

1. Catalyst composition: The active species for methane activation is Mo2C, formed by reduction of Mo6+ ions under reaction conditions. The presence of both Mo species and Brønsted acid sites in the zeolite is important for the overall reaction.

2. Catalyst structure: The distribution of Mo species between the external surface and internal channels of the zeolite affects catalytic performance. Higher dispersion and some diffusion into channels occurs at higher calcination temperatures.

3. Reaction conditions: Temperature plays a crucial role, with 700°C typically used for Mo2C formation and methane activation. The absence of gas-phase oxygen is notable for this particular reaction.

4. Mechanism: Methane is activated on Mo2C sites to form methyl radicals, which then undergo further reactions on acid sites to form aromatics.

5. Efficiency: Benzene selectivities of 60-70% at methane conversions of 4-8% are reported, indicating moderate efficiency.

The industrial significance of this specific catalyst system is not directly addressed, but the direct conversion of methane to higher-value aromatics without an oxidant is of considerable interest for natural gas utilization.

文献主要集中在Mo/ZSM-5催化剂上用于甲烷转化为芳烃，而不是钒氧化物或其他金属交换沸石用于烷烃转化。然而，我们可以得出一些关于组成、结构和反应条件如何影响催化机理和效率的见解：

1. 催化剂组成：甲烷活化的活性物种是Mo2C，由Mo6+离子在反应条件下还原形成。沸石中Mo物种和Brønsted酸性位点的存在对整个反应都很重要。

2. 催化剂结构：Mo物种在沸石外表面和内部通道之间的分布影响催化性能。在更高的煅烧温度下，分散度更高，并且有一些扩散到通道内。

3. 反应条件：温度起着关键作用，通常使用700°C形成Mo2C和活化甲烷。值得注意的是，这种特定反应不需要气相氧。

4. 机理：甲烷在Mo2C位点上被活化形成甲基自由基，然后在酸性位点上进一步反应形成芳烃。

5. 效率：报告的苯选择性为60-70%，甲烷转化率为4-8%，表明效率适中。

文献并未直接讨论这种特定催化剂系统的工业重要性，但是在没有氧化剂的情况下直接将甲烷转化为高附加值芳烃对天然气利用具有相当大的意义。

The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts, particularly Mo/ZSM-5, significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations, specifically in the dehydroaromatization of methane to benzene. 

The catalyst composition of 2 wt% Mo on ZSM-5 zeolite support plays a crucial role. The structure of the catalyst evolves during the reaction, with Mo6+ ions being reduced to form Mo2C (60-80%) and some Mo4+ and Mo5+ species. This transformation is key to the catalyst's activity.

Reaction conditions, particularly temperature (700°C) and the absence of added oxidants, are critical. These conditions promote the reduction of Mo species and the formation of the active Mo2C phase.

The mechanism involves an initial activation period, during which the catalyst structure changes and coke deposition occurs. This leads to the formation of a coke-modified Mo2C surface, which is believed to be the actual active species for forming ethylene as a reaction intermediate.

The efficiency of the process is reflected in the benzene selectivity of 60-65% at a CH4 conversion of 4-8% after the activation period. This demonstrates the catalyst's ability to selectively transform methane into valuable aromatic compounds.

While this specific example focuses on methane dehydroaromatization, it illustrates the complex interplay between catalyst composition, structure, and reaction conditions in alkane transformations. The industrial significance of such processes lies in their potential to convert abundant natural gas (primarily methane) into more valuable chemical products, although the relatively low conversion rates suggest that further optimization would be needed for practical applications.

The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations. For the specific case of methane dehydroaromatization to benzene, a 2 wt% Mo/ZSM-5 catalyst is used. The active species for methane activation is Mo2C, formed by reduction of Mo6+ ions under reaction conditions at 700°C. 

The structure of the catalyst involves Mo species dispersed on the external surface and within the channels of the ZSM-5 zeolite. The reaction conditions, particularly the high temperature of 700°C and the absence of added oxidants, promote the formation of Mo2C from the original Mo6+ ions. 

The efficiency of the transformation is influenced by several factors:

1. Pretreatment: Pretreatment in a CH4/H2 gas mixture at 700°C reduces the induction period by forming Mo2C prior to the reaction.

2. Degree of reduction: Under typical reaction conditions, 60-80% of Mo6+ ions are reduced to Mo2C, with the remaining Mo present as Mo4+ and Mo5+.

3. Acid sites: The presence of acid sites in the ZSM-5 zeolite is necessary for high benzene selectivity and methane conversion.

4. Coke formation: A coke-modified Mo2C surface may be the actual active species for forming ethylene as an intermediate.

The industrial significance of this process lies in its potential for direct conversion of methane to higher-value aromatic compounds like benzene, without the need for synthesis gas as an intermediate. However, the high temperature required and the tendency for coke formation may present challenges for large-scale application.

3. 酸性位点：ZSM-5分子筛中酸性位点的存在对于获得高苯选择性和甲烷转化率是必要的。

4. 积炭形成：积炭改性的Mo2C表面可能是形成乙烯中间体的实际活性物种。

这个过程的工业意义在于它可以直接将甲烷转化为苯等更高价值的芳香族化合物，而不需要合成气作为中间体。然而，所需的高温和积炭倾向可能会给大规模应用带来挑战。
