[1] "Two Mo/HZSM-5 catalyst series have been tested in the partial oxidation of methane to formaldehyde at atmospheric pressure."

[2] "Two different molybdenum species were detected in these catalysts: tetrahedral monomeric Mo(VI) species and octahedral coordinated polymolybdate species."

[3] "For molybdenum loading higher than 1.3 wt.%, polymolybdate species are predominant causing a decrease in the dispersion and a partial blocking up of the HZSM-5 zeolite channels."

[4] "Both catalyst series show different activity in methane conversion. Polymolybdate species of impregnated Mo/HZSM-5 catalysts are more reactive in methane activation than acid sites of HZSM-5 but lead to low HCOH selectivity values."

[5] "In contrast, treated catalysts show lower methane conversion but higher HCOH selectivity. These results demonstrate the specificity of the Mo=O sites of monomeric species for HCOH production."

The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations. In this study, Mo/HZSM-5 catalysts were tested for partial oxidation of methane to formaldehyde. The composition of the catalysts, particularly the molybdenum loading, affected the species present and their dispersion. At higher Mo loadings (>1.3 wt.%), polymolybdate species became predominant, leading to decreased dispersion and partial blocking of zeolite channels.

The structure of the molybdenum species (tetrahedral monomeric vs. octahedral polymolybdate) influenced the catalytic activity and selectivity. Polymolybdate species were more reactive for methane activation but showed lower formaldehyde selectivity. In contrast, catalysts with predominantly monomeric Mo species exhibited lower methane conversion but higher formaldehyde selectivity.

The study demonstrates that the Mo=O sites of monomeric species are specific for formaldehyde production, highlighting the importance of catalyst structure in determining reaction outcomes. While the industrial significance is not directly addressed, the focus on improving formaldehyde yield suggests potential industrial applications for natural gas utilization.

金属基催化剂的成分、结构和反应条件显著影响烷烃转化的机理和效率。在这项研究中，Mo/HZSM-5催化剂被用于甲烷部分氧化制甲醛的测试。催化剂的成分，特别是钼的负载量，影响了存在的物种及其分散度。在较高的钼负载量（>1.3 wt.%）下，多钼酸盐物种占主导地位，导致分散度降低和沸石通道的部分堵塞。

钼物种的结构（四面体单体vs八面体多钼酸盐）影响了催化活性和选择性。多钼酸盐物种对甲烷活化更具反应性，但表现出较低的甲醛选择性。相比之下，主要含有单体钼物种的催化剂表现出较低的甲烷转化率但更高的甲醛选择性。

研究表明，单体物种的Mo=O位点对甲醛生成具有特异性，突出了催化剂结构在决定反应结果中的重要性。虽然没有直接提到工业意义，但对提高甲醛产率的关注表明了这项技术在天然气利用方面的潜在工业应用。
