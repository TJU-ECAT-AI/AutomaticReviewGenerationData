[1] "Two Mo/HZSM-5 catalyst series have been tested in the partial oxidation of methane to formaldehyde at atmospheric pressure."

[2] "Two different molybdenum species were detected in these catalysts: tetrahedral monomeric Mo(VI) species and octahedral coordinated polymolybdate species."

[3] "For molybdenum loading higher than 1.3 wt.%, polymolybdate species are predominant causing a decrease in the dispersion and a partial blocking up of the HZSM-5 zeolite channels."

[4] "Both catalyst series show different activity in methane conversion. Polymolybdate species of impregnated Mo/HZSM-5 catalysts are more reactive in methane activation than acid sites of HZSM-5 but lead to low HCOH selectivity values."

[5] "In contrast, treated catalysts show lower methane conversion but higher HCOH selectivity. These results demonstrate the specificity of the Mo=O sites of monomeric species for HCOH production."

The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations. In this study, Mo/HZSM-5 catalysts were used for the partial oxidation of methane to formaldehyde.

The composition of the catalysts, specifically the molybdenum loading, affects the species present and their distribution. At lower loadings, tetrahedral monomeric Mo(VI) species are present, while at higher loadings (>1.3 wt%), polymolybdate species become predominant. This change in composition impacts the structure of the catalyst, causing a decrease in dispersion and partial blocking of zeolite channels at higher loadings.

The structure of the molybdenum species (monomeric vs polymolybdate) influences the reaction mechanism and efficiency. Polymolybdate species are more reactive in methane activation but lead to lower formaldehyde selectivity. In contrast, monomeric species, specifically the Mo=O sites, show higher selectivity for formaldehyde production.

Reaction conditions, such as atmospheric pressure and the use of HZSM-5 as a support, also play a role in the catalytic process. The study demonstrates that by controlling the preparation method and molybdenum loading, it's possible to tune the catalyst's performance towards either higher methane conversion or higher formaldehyde selectivity.

While this study focuses on methane partial oxidation, the insights gained about the relationship between catalyst composition, structure, and performance are relevant to other alkane transformation processes. The ability to control selectivity and conversion through catalyst design is crucial for industrial applications, as it allows for the optimization of desired product yields and process efficiency.

金属基催化剂的组成、结构和反应条件显著影响烷烃转化的机理和效率。在这项研究中，Mo/HZSM-5催化剂被用于甲烷部分氧化制甲醛。

催化剂的组成，特别是钼的负载量，影响存在的物种及其分布。在较低负载量时，存在四面体单体Mo(VI)物种，而在较高负载量（>1.3 wt%）时，多钼酸盐物种变得占主导地位。这种组成的变化影响催化剂的结构，导致在较高负载量时分散度降低和沸石通道部分堵塞。

钼物种的结构（单体vs多钼酸盐）影响反应机理和效率。多钼酸盐物种在甲烷活化方面更具反应性，但导致较低的甲醛选择性。相比之下，单体物种，特别是Mo=O位点，表现出更高的甲醛生产选择性。

反应条件，如大气压力和使用HZSM-5作为载体，也在催化过程中发挥作用。研究表明，通过控制制备方法和钼负载量，可以调节催化剂的性能，以实现更高的甲烷转化率或更高的甲醛选择性。

虽然这项研究集中在甲烷部分氧化上，但关于催化剂组成、结构和性能之间关系的见解与其他烷烃转化过程也相关。通过催化剂设计控制选择性和转化率的能力对于工业应用至关重要，因为它允许优化所需产品的产量和过程效率。
