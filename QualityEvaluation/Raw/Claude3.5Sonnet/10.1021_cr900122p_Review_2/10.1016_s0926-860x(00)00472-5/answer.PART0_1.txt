[1] "Two Mo/HZSM-5 catalyst series have been tested in the partial oxidation of methane to formaldehyde at atmospheric pressure."

[2] "For molybdenum loading higher than 1.3 wt.%, polymolybdate species are predominant causing a decrease in the dispersion and a partial blocking up of the HZSM-5 zeolite channels."

[3] "Polymolybdate species of impregnated Mo/HZSM-5 catalysts are more reactive in methane activation than acid sites of HZSM-5 but lead to low HCOH selectivity values."

[4] "In contrast, treated catalysts show lower methane conversion but higher HCOH selectivity. These results demonstrate the specificity of the Mo=O sites of monomeric species for HCOH production."

[5] "It seems to be a general agreement in the catalytic role of each active site in the methane partial oxidation [6,911]. Thus, Mo=O sites of terminal atoms in molybdenum oxide crystallites or isolated monomeric species seem to be specific sites for HCOH production, while MoOMo sites of polymolybdate species and MoO3 cluster would lead to the total oxidation products."

The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations. For Mo/HZSM-5 catalysts in methane partial oxidation:

1. Catalyst composition affects performance: Higher Mo loading (>1.3 wt%) leads to predominant polymolybdate species, causing decreased dispersion and partial blocking of zeolite channels.

2. Different Mo species have distinct roles: Polymolybdate species are more reactive for methane activation but give low formaldehyde selectivity. Monomeric Mo=O sites are specific for formaldehyde production.

3. Preparation method impacts catalyst structure and performance: Conventionally impregnated catalysts show higher methane conversion but lower formaldehyde selectivity, while treated catalysts exhibit the opposite trend.

4. Reaction conditions: The study used atmospheric pressure and a CH4:O2 molar ratio of 5.3:1 at 600°C.

These factors contribute to industrial significance by allowing tailoring of catalysts for desired products. The ability to control Mo species (monomeric vs polymolybdate) through preparation methods and loading enables optimization of methane conversion and formaldehyde selectivity.

金属基催化剂的组成、结构和反应条件显著影响烷烃转化的机理和效率。对于甲烷部分氧化中的Mo/HZSM-5催化剂：

1. 催化剂组成影响性能：较高的Mo负载量(>1.3 wt%)导致多钼酸盐物种占主导地位，造成分散度降低和沸石通道部分堵塞。

2. 不同的Mo物种具有不同的作用：多钼酸盐物种对甲烷活化更具反应性，但甲醛选择性低。单体Mo=O位点专一性地生成甲醛。

3. 制备方法影响催化剂结构和性能：常规浸渍的催化剂表现出较高的甲烷转化率但甲醛选择性较低，而处理过的催化剂则表现出相反的趋势。

4. 反应条件：研究在常压下进行，CH4:O2摩尔比为5.3:1，温度为600°C。

这些因素通过允许定制催化剂以获得所需产品而对工业具有重要意义。通过制备方法和负载量控制Mo物种（单体vs多钼酸盐）的能力，使得优化甲烷转化率和甲醛选择性成为可能。
