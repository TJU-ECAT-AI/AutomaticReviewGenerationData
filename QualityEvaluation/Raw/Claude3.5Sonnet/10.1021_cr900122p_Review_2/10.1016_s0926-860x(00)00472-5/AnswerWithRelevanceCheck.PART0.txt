          [1] "Two Mo/HZSM-5 catalyst series have been tested in the partial oxidation of methane to formaldehyde at atmospheric pressure."

[2] "Two different molybdenum species were detected in these catalysts: tetrahedral monomeric Mo(VI) species and octahedral coordinated polymolybdate species."

[3] "For molybdenum loading higher than 1.3 wt.%, polymolybdate species are predominant causing a decrease in the dispersion and a partial blocking up of the HZSM-5 zeolite channels."

[4] "Both catalyst series show different activity in methane conversion. Polymolybdate species of impregnated Mo/HZSM-5 catalysts are more reactive in methane activation than acid sites of HZSM-5 but lead to low HCOH selectivity values."

[5] "In contrast, treated catalysts show lower methane conversion but higher HCOH selectivity. These results demonstrate the specificity of the Mo=O sites of monomeric species for HCOH production."

[6] "It seems to be a general agreement in the catalytic role of each active site in the methane partial oxidation [6,911]. Thus, Mo=O sites of terminal atoms in molybdenum oxide crystallites or isolated monomeric species seem to be specific sites for HCOH production, while MoOMo sites of polymolybdate species and MoO3 cluster would lead to the total oxidation products."

[7] "A well-dispersed molybdenum oxide phase mainly constituted of tetrahedral monomeric species joined to the zeolite surface was characterized."

          The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations, particularly in the partial oxidation of methane to formaldehyde. For Mo/HZSM-5 catalysts:

1. Composition: The molybdenum loading affects the type and distribution of molybdenum species. At lower loadings, tetrahedral monomeric Mo(VI) species are present, while at higher loadings (>1.3 wt%), polymolybdate species become predominant.

2. Structure: The catalyst structure is influenced by the molybdenum species present. Higher molybdenum loadings lead to decreased dispersion and partial blocking of zeolite channels. Well-dispersed monomeric species are joined to the zeolite surface.

3. Reaction mechanisms: Different molybdenum species show varying catalytic behavior. Polymolybdate species are more reactive in methane activation but lead to lower formaldehyde selectivity. Monomeric Mo=O sites are specific for formaldehyde production.

4. Efficiency: Impregnated catalysts with polymolybdate species show higher methane conversion but lower formaldehyde selectivity. Treated catalysts with predominantly monomeric species exhibit lower methane conversion but higher formaldehyde selectivity.

5. Reaction conditions: The study was conducted at atmospheric pressure and 600°C, demonstrating the influence of reaction conditions on the catalytic process.

These factors contribute to the industrial significance of metal-based catalysts by allowing for the tailoring of catalyst properties to optimize desired product yields and process efficiency. The ability to control the distribution of active sites (e.g., Mo=O vs. MoOMo) through preparation methods and loading enables the fine-tuning of catalyst performance for specific alkane transformation processes.

          金属基催化剂的组成、结构和反应条件显著影响烷烃转化的机理和效率，特别是在甲烷部分氧化制甲醛的过程中。对于Mo/HZSM-5催化剂：

1. 组成：钼的负载量影响钼物种的类型和分布。在较低负载量时，存在四面体单体Mo(VI)物种，而在较高负载量（>1.3 wt%）时，多钼酸盐物种变得占主导地位。

2. 结构：催化剂结构受存在的钼物种影响。较高的钼负载量导致分散度降低和沸石通道部分堵塞。良好分散的单体物种与沸石表面结合。

3. 反应机理：不同的钼物种表现出不同的催化行为。多钼酸盐物种在甲烷活化方面更具反应性，但导致较低的甲醛选择性。单体Mo=O位点专一性地生成甲醛。

4. 效率：含有多钼酸盐物种的浸渍催化剂表现出较高的甲烷转化率但甲醛选择性较低。以单体物种为主的处理过的催化剂表现出较低的甲烷转化率但较高的甲醛选择性。

5. 反应条件：研究在常压和600°C下进行，表明了反应条件对催化过程的影响。

这些因素通过允许定制催化剂性能以优化所需产品产率和过程效率，为金属基催化剂的工业重要性做出贡献。通过制备方法和负载量控制活性位点分布（如Mo=O vs. MoOMo）的能力，使得可以针对特定烷烃转化过程微调催化剂性能。
