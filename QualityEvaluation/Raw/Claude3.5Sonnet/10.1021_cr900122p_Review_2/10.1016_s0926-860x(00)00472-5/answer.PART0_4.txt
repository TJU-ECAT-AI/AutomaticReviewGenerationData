[1] "Two Mo/HZSM-5 catalyst series have been tested in the partial oxidation of methane to formaldehyde at atmospheric pressure."

[2] "For molybdenum loading higher than 1.3 wt.%, polymolybdate species are predominant causing a decrease in the dispersion and a partial blocking up of the HZSM-5 zeolite channels."

[3] "A well-dispersed molybdenum oxide phase mainly constituted of tetrahedral monomeric species joined to the zeolite surface was characterized."

[4] "Polymolybdate species of impregnated Mo/HZSM-5 catalysts are more reactive in methane activation than acid sites of HZSM-5 but lead to low HCOH selectivity values."

[5] "In contrast, treated catalysts show lower methane conversion but higher HCOH selectivity. These results demonstrate the specificity of the Mo=O sites of monomeric species for HCOH production."

The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations, particularly in the partial oxidation of methane to formaldehyde. For Mo/HZSM-5 catalysts, the molybdenum loading affects the dispersion and nature of molybdenum species, which in turn impacts catalytic performance. 

At higher molybdenum loadings (>1.3 wt.%), polymolybdate species become predominant, leading to decreased dispersion and partial blocking of zeolite channels. These polymolybdate species are more reactive in methane activation but result in lower formaldehyde selectivity.

In contrast, well-dispersed monomeric molybdenum species, particularly tetrahedral species joined to the zeolite surface, show higher selectivity for formaldehyde production. This demonstrates the specificity of Mo=O sites in monomeric species for formaldehyde formation.

The study highlights the importance of controlling catalyst composition and structure to optimize the desired alkane transformation. The ability to tune selectivity and activity through careful catalyst design contributes to the industrial significance of these materials in processes like partial oxidation of methane.

金属基催化剂的组成、结构和反应条件显著影响烷烃转化的机理和效率，特别是在甲烷部分氧化制甲醛的过程中。对于Mo/HZSM-5催化剂，钼的负载量影响钼物种的分散性和性质，进而影响催化性能。

在较高的钼负载量（>1.3 wt.%）下，多钼酸盐物种成为主要形态，导致分散性降低和沸石通道部分堵塞。这些多钼酸盐物种在甲烷活化方面更具反应性，但会导致甲醛选择性降低。

相比之下，良好分散的单体钼物种，特别是与沸石表面结合的四面体物种，表现出更高的甲醛生成选择性。这证明了单体物种中Mo=O位点对甲醛形成的特异性。

该研究强调了控制催化剂组成和结构以优化所需烷烃转化的重要性。通过精心设计催化剂来调节选择性和活性的能力，为这些材料在甲烷部分氧化等工业过程中的重要性做出了贡献。
