[1] "Two Mo/HZSM-5 catalyst series have been tested in the partial oxidation of methane to formaldehyde at atmospheric pressure."

[2] "Two different molybdenum species were detected in these catalysts: tetrahedral monomeric Mo(VI) species and octahedral coordinated polymolybdate species."

[3] "For molybdenum loading higher than 1.3 wt.%, polymolybdate species are predominant causing a decrease in the dispersion and a partial blocking up of the HZSM-5 zeolite channels."

[4] "Both catalyst series show different activity in methane conversion. Polymolybdate species of impregnated Mo/HZSM-5 catalysts are more reactive in methane activation than acid sites of HZSM-5 but lead to low HCOH selectivity values."

[5] "In contrast, treated catalysts show lower methane conversion but higher HCOH selectivity. These results demonstrate the specificity of the Mo=O sites of monomeric species for HCOH production."

The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations. In this study, Mo/HZSM-5 catalysts were tested for the partial oxidation of methane to formaldehyde. The catalysts contained two types of molybdenum species: tetrahedral monomeric Mo(VI) species and octahedral coordinated polymolybdate species. The distribution of these species depended on the molybdenum loading, with polymolybdate species becoming predominant at loadings higher than 1.3 wt.%.

The structure of the catalyst affected its performance. Polymolybdate species in impregnated Mo/HZSM-5 catalysts were more reactive in methane activation but led to low formaldehyde selectivity. In contrast, catalysts with mainly monomeric Mo species showed lower methane conversion but higher formaldehyde selectivity. This demonstrates the specificity of Mo=O sites of monomeric species for formaldehyde production.

The study highlights the importance of controlling the metal species distribution and dispersion on the support to optimize catalyst performance. The reaction was conducted at atmospheric pressure and 600°C, indicating the influence of reaction conditions on the process.

While this study focuses on Mo/HZSM-5 catalysts for methane partial oxidation, it illustrates broader principles applicable to other metal-based catalysts in alkane transformations. The ability to tune catalyst composition and structure to achieve desired product selectivity is crucial for industrial applications, as it can lead to more efficient and economical processes.

金属基催化剂的组成、结构和反应条件显著影响烷烃转化的机理和效率。在这项研究中，Mo/HZSM-5催化剂被用于甲烷部分氧化制甲醛的测试。催化剂含有两种钼物种：四面体单体Mo(VI)物种和八面体配位的多钼酸盐物种。这些物种的分布取决于钼的负载量，当负载量高于1.3 wt.%时，多钼酸盐物种占主导地位。

催化剂的结构影响其性能。浸渍Mo/HZSM-5催化剂中的多钼酸盐物种在甲烷活化方面更具反应性，但导致较低的甲醛选择性。相比之下，主要含有单体Mo物种的催化剂显示出较低的甲烷转化率但较高的甲醛选择性。这证明了单体物种的Mo=O位点对甲醛生产的特异性。

该研究强调了控制金属物种在载体上的分布和分散度对优化催化剂性能的重要性。反应在常压和600°C下进行，表明了反应条件对过程的影响。

虽然这项研究主要关注Mo/HZSM-5催化剂用于甲烷部分氧化，但它阐述了适用于其他金属基催化剂在烷烃转化中的更广泛原则。能够调整催化剂组成和结构以达到所需的产品选择性对工业应用至关重要，因为这可以导致更高效和经济的过程。
