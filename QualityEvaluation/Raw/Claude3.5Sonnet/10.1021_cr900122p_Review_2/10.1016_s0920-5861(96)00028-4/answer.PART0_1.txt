[1] "The addition of Ga and Zn to H-ZSM5 does not appear to perturb these reaction pathways. Initial reaction products do not contain 13C and are formed predominantly from unlabeled propene molecules in the feed mixture."

[2] "Ga and Zn species increase the rates of propane chemical conversion, recombinative hydrogen desorption, and deuterium incorporation from D2 into reaction products."

[3] "Disposal of hydrogen formed in C-H bond activation steps occurs by transfer of H-atoms to unsaturated species to form alkanes or to Ga and Zn species, which catalyze the recombinative desorption of H-atoms to form dihydrogen (H2)."

[4] "In-situ X-ray absorption studies suggest that Ga and Zn species reside at cation exchange sites as monomeric cations and that recombinative desorption involve reduction-oxidation cycles of such cations during each dehydrocyclodimerization turnover."

[5] "The addition of metal cations also increases the deuterium content in 'unreacted' propane (Fig. 18). The rate of incorporation of D-atoms into 'unreacted' propane provides an independent measure of the D-content in the surface pool"

Metal-based catalysts like Ga and Zn-exchanged zeolites influence alkane transformations in several ways:

1. They increase the rates of propane conversion, hydrogen desorption, and deuterium incorporation without altering the basic reaction pathways.

2. These metal species act as sites for recombinative desorption of hydrogen atoms, forming H2 and improving the efficiency of dehydrogenation reactions.

3. The metal cations reside at exchange sites as monomeric species and undergo redox cycles during the catalytic process.

4. They enhance the incorporation of deuterium into unreacted propane, indicating increased interaction between the gas phase and surface species.

5. The presence of these metals allows for more efficient hydrogen removal, which is often a rate-limiting step in alkane transformations.

These factors contribute to the industrial significance of metal-exchanged zeolites by improving reaction rates and selectivities in processes like propane dehydrocyclodimerization. The ability to fine-tune catalyst composition and structure allows for optimization of desired product yields while minimizing unwanted side reactions.

金属基催化剂如Ga和Zn交换的沸石对烷烃转化的影响有以下几个方面：

1. 它们提高了丙烷转化、氢脱附和氘掺入的速率，但不改变基本反应途径。

2. 这些金属物种作为氢原子重组脱附的位点，形成H2并提高脱氢反应的效率。

3. 金属阳离子以单体形式存在于交换位点，并在催化过程中经历氧化还原循环。

4. 它们增强了氘向未反应丙烷的掺入，表明气相和表面物种之间的相互作用增强。

5. 这些金属的存在允许更有效地去除氢，而氢的去除通常是烷烃转化中的限速步骤。

这些因素通过提高丙烷脱氢环二聚等过程的反应速率和选择性，增加了金属交换沸石的工业重要性。能够精细调节催化剂组成和结构，可以优化所需产物的产率，同时最大限度地减少不需要的副反应。
