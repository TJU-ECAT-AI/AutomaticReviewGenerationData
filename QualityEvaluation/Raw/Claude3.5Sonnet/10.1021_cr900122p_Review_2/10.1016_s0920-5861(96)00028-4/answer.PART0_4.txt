[1] "Ga and Zn species increase the rates of propane chemical conversion, recombinative hydrogen desorption, and deuterium incorporation from D2 into reaction products."

[2] "Disposal of hydrogen formed in C-H bond activation steps occurs by transfer of H-atoms to unsaturated species to form alkanes or to Ga and Zn species, which catalyze the recombinative desorption of H-atoms to form dihydrogen (H2)."

[3] "In-situ X-ray absorption studies suggest that Ga and Zn species reside at cation exchange sites as monomeric cations and that recombinative desorption involve reduction-oxidation cycles of such cations during each dehydrocyclodimerization turnover."

[4] "The addition of metal cations also increases the deuterium content in 'unreacted' propane (Fig. 18). The rate of incorporation of D-atoms into 'unreacted' propane provides an independent measure of the D-content in the surface pool"

[5] "Clearly, Ga and Zn species increase the reversibility of H-atom recombinative desorption steps and act as efficient 'portholes' for the removal of H-atoms produced during C-H bond activation steps."

The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations in processes like oxidative dehydrogenation and zeolite-catalyzed reactions.

For metal-exchanged zeolites, particularly those containing Ga and Zn, the presence of these metal cations enhances the rate of propane conversion and hydrogen desorption. These metal species act as "portholes" for removing hydrogen atoms produced during C-H bond activation steps, catalyzing the recombinative desorption of H-atoms to form H2.

The structure of these metal species is important - in-situ X-ray absorption studies show that Ga and Zn reside at cation exchange sites as monomeric cations. The recombinative desorption process involves reduction-oxidation cycles of these cations during each dehydrocyclodimerization turnover.

Reaction conditions, such as the presence of deuterium in the reactant mixture, can be used to probe the mechanism of these reactions. The incorporation of deuterium into unreacted propane and reaction products provides insight into the surface hydrogen pool and the reversibility of hydrogen desorption steps.

These metal-modified zeolites are industrially significant because they increase the efficiency of alkane transformation processes. By facilitating hydrogen removal, they enhance the rate of propane conversion and improve selectivity towards desired products like aromatics, while reducing unwanted side reactions like cracking.

金属基催化剂的组成、结构和反应条件显著影响了烷烃转化过程中的机理和效率,特别是在氧化脱氢和沸石催化反应等过程中。

对于含有Ga和Zn的金属交换沸石,这些金属阳离子的存在增强了丙烷转化和氢脱附的速率。这些金属物种充当"窗口",移除C-H键活化步骤中产生的氢原子,催化H原子的重组脱附形成H2。

这些金属物种的结构很重要 - 原位X射线吸收研究表明,Ga和Zn以单体阳离子的形式存在于阳离子交换位点。重组脱附过程涉及这些阳离子在每次脱氢环化二聚转化过程中的还原-氧化循环。

反应条件,如反应物混合物中存在氘,可用于探测这些反应的机理。未反应丙烷和反应产物中氘的掺入提供了关于表面氢池和氢脱附步骤可逆性的见解。

这些金属改性沸石具有工业重要性,因为它们提高了烷烃转化过程的效率。通过促进氢的去除,它们增强了丙烷转化的速率,提高了对芳烃等目标产物的选择性,同时减少了裂解等不需要的副反应。
