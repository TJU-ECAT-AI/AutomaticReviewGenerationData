[1] "Zeolite-Supported Catalysts"

[2] "Catalytic Pyrolysis and Nonoxidative Coupling of Methane at High-Temperatures"

</quotes>

<EnglishVersionAnswer>

The literature does not provide detailed information about metal-based catalysts for alkane transformations, oxidative dehydrogenation, or the industrial significance of these processes. The document only briefly mentions zeolite-supported catalysts and catalytic pyrolysis of methane at high temperatures, without discussing their mechanisms, efficiency, or influencing factors in detail. There is insufficient information to fully answer the question based solely on the given text.
