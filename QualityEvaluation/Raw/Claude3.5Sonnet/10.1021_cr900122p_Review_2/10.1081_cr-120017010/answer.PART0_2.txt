[1] "Zeolite-Supported Catalysts"

[2] "Catalytic Pyrolysis and Nonoxidative Coupling of Methane at High-Temperatures"

</quotes>

<EnglishVersionAnswer>

The literature does not provide detailed information about the composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts for alkane transformations. It only briefly mentions zeolite-supported catalysts and high-temperature catalytic pyrolysis of methane, without discussing specifics about oxidative dehydrogenation or factors contributing to industrial significance. There is insufficient information in the given text to fully answer the question about how these catalysts influence mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations.
