[1] "Zn-modified zeolites are effective catalysts for light alkanes aromatization [14]. The enhanced selectivity of alkane conversion (ethane [57] and propane [8,9]) towards aromatics is attributed to dehydrogenation ability of the loaded zinc species."

[2] "It has been claimed [2,3] that strong Lewis sites, which are generated by zinc, change the mechanism of alkane activation and transformation from the beta scission to a dehydrogenation step."

[3] "For Zn/H-BEA, the kinetic parameters of H/D exchange change dramatically. The rate constants kSiOHAl are at least two orders of magnitude higher. The activation energy of 8688 kJ mol1 is rather low. The exchange proceeds with a notable rate at temperatures at least 100 K lower compared to that on H-BEA."

[4] "The promotion may consist of involvement of Zn-alkyl species in the exchange. They can be formed either on ZnO clusters or Zn2+ cations, located on neighbor or remote SiO()Al groups."

The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts like supported vanadium oxides and metal-exchanged zeolites significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations. For Zn-modified zeolites:

1. Composition: The addition of zinc to zeolites creates strong Lewis acid sites, which changes the mechanism of alkane activation from beta scission to dehydrogenation. This enhances the selectivity towards aromatics in light alkane aromatization.

2. Structure: Zinc can be present as ZnO clusters or Zn2+ cations located on SiO()Al groups in the zeolite framework. These zinc species are involved in forming Zn-alkyl intermediates, which play a crucial role in the reaction mechanism.

3. Reaction conditions: Zn-modified zeolites allow for lower reaction temperatures. For example, in H/D exchange reactions, Zn/H-BEA catalysts operate at temperatures at least 100 K lower than unmodified H-BEA zeolites.

4. Efficiency: The presence of zinc dramatically improves reaction rates. In H/D exchange reactions, rate constants for Zn/H-BEA are at least two orders of magnitude higher than for H-BEA. The activation energy is also significantly lower (86-88 kJ/mol for Zn/H-BEA vs. 138 kJ/mol for H-BEA).

These factors contribute to the industrial significance of metal-modified zeolites by allowing for more selective, efficient, and energy-saving processes in alkane transformations such as aromatization and dehydrogenation.

金属基催化剂（如负载型钒氧化物和金属交换沸石）的组成、结构和反应条件显著影响烷烃转化的机理和效率。对于锌改性沸石：

1. 组成：向沸石中添加锌会产生强Lewis酸位，这改变了烷烃活化机理，从β裂解转变为脱氢。这提高了轻烷烃芳构化过程中对芳烃的选择性。

2. 结构：锌可以以ZnO簇或位于沸石骨架SiO()Al基团上的Zn2+阳离子形式存在。这些锌物种参与形成Zn-烷基中间体，在反应机理中起关键作用。

3. 反应条件：锌改性沸石允许在更低的反应温度下进行。例如，在H/D交换反应中，Zn/H-BEA催化剂的操作温度比未改性的H-BEA沸石至少低100 K。

4. 效率：锌的存在显著提高了反应速率。在H/D交换反应中，Zn/H-BEA的速率常数至少比H-BEA高两个数量级。活化能也显著降低（Zn/H-BEA为86-88 kJ/mol，而H-BEA为138 kJ/mol）。

这些因素通过允许在烷烃转化（如芳构化和脱氢）过程中实现更具选择性、更高效和更节能的过程，提高了金属改性沸石的工业重要性。
