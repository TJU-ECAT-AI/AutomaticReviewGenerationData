[1] "Zn-modified zeolites are effective catalysts for light alkanes aromatization [14]. The enhanced selectivity of alkane conversion (ethane [57] and propane [8,9]) towards aromatics is attributed to dehydrogenation ability of the loaded zinc species."

[2] "It has been claimed [2,3] that strong Lewis sites, which are generated by zinc, change the mechanism of alkane activation and transformation from the beta scission to a dehydrogenation step."

[3] "For Zn/H-BEA, the kinetic parameters of H/D exchange change dramatically. The rate constants kSiOHAl are at least two orders of magnitude higher. The activation energy of 8688 kJ mol1 is rather low."

[4] "The lower apparent activation energy for the exchange on Zn/H-BEA and the low temperature range of this reaction imply a promoting effect of Zn on the reaction of the H/D exchange."

[5] "We propose that the mechanism of the H/D exchange on Zn/H-BEA involves Zn-alkyl species as intermediates."

The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts, particularly Zn-modified zeolites, significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations. 

For Zn-modified zeolites:
1. They are effective catalysts for light alkane aromatization.
2. The loaded zinc species enhance selectivity towards aromatics through their dehydrogenation ability.
3. Strong Lewis sites generated by zinc change the mechanism of alkane activation from beta scission to dehydrogenation.
4. In H/D exchange reactions, Zn/H-BEA shows dramatically different kinetic parameters compared to H-BEA:
   - Rate constants are at least two orders of magnitude higher
   - Activation energy is much lower (86-88 kJ/mol)
   - Reactions occur at lower temperatures
5. The promoting effect of Zn is attributed to the involvement of Zn-alkyl species as intermediates in the reaction mechanism.

These factors contribute to the industrial significance of Zn-modified zeolites by improving catalytic performance, increasing reaction rates, lowering activation energies, and enabling reactions to occur under milder conditions. The ability to tune catalytic properties through metal loading and modification of zeolites allows for the development of more efficient and selective catalysts for alkane transformations, including oxidative dehydrogenation and other zeolite-catalyzed reactions.

[2] "It has been claimed [2,3] that strong Lewis sites, which are generated by zinc, change the mechanism of alkane activation and transformation from the beta scission to a dehydrogenation step."

The activation energy of 86–88 kJ mol−1 is rather low. The exchange proceeds with a notable rate at temperatures at least 100 K lower compared to that on H-BEA."

[5] "The lower apparent activation energy for the exchange on Zn/H-BEA and the low temperature range of this reaction imply a promoting effect of Zn on the reaction of the H/D exchange.

The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts, particularly Zn-modified zeolites, significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations. Key factors include:

1. Zinc loading: The presence of zinc in zeolites enhances the selectivity of alkane conversion towards aromatics due to the dehydrogenation ability of zinc species.

2. Lewis acidity: Strong Lewis sites generated by zinc change the mechanism of alkane activation from beta scission to dehydrogenation.

3. Formation of adsorption complexes: Zn2+ cations form strong adsorption complexes with small alkanes, facilitating their activation.

4. Reaction kinetics: Zn-modified zeolites dramatically change the kinetics of H/D exchange, with rate constants at least two orders of magnitude higher and lower activation energies compared to unmodified zeolites.

5. Temperature range: Zn-modified zeolites allow reactions to proceed at temperatures at least 100 K lower than unmodified zeolites.

These factors contribute to the industrial significance of Zn-modified zeolites by enabling more efficient and selective alkane transformations at lower temperatures, potentially reducing energy costs and improving product yields in processes such as aromatization and dehydrogenation.

The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts like supported vanadium oxides and metal-exchanged zeolites significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations. For Zn-modified zeolites:

1. Composition: The addition of zinc to zeolites creates strong Lewis acid sites, which changes the mechanism of alkane activation from beta scission to dehydrogenation. This enhances the selectivity towards aromatics in light alkane aromatization.

2. Structure: Zinc can be present as ZnO clusters or Zn2+ cations located on SiO()Al groups in the zeolite framework. These zinc species are involved in forming Zn-alkyl intermediates, which play a crucial role in the reaction mechanism.

3. Reaction conditions: Zn-modified zeolites allow for lower reaction temperatures. For example, in H/D exchange reactions, Zn/H-BEA catalysts operate at temperatures at least 100 K lower than unmodified H-BEA zeolites.

4. Efficiency: The presence of zinc dramatically improves reaction rates. In H/D exchange reactions, rate constants for Zn/H-BEA are at least two orders of magnitude higher than for H-BEA. The activation energy is also significantly lower (86-88 kJ/mol for Zn/H-BEA vs. 138 kJ/mol for H-BEA).

These factors contribute to the industrial significance of metal-modified zeolites by allowing for more selective, efficient, and energy-saving processes in alkane transformations such as aromatization and dehydrogenation.

The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts like supported vanadium oxides and metal-exchanged zeolites significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations. 

For Zn-modified zeolites, the introduction of zinc species enhances the selectivity towards aromatics in light alkane aromatization processes. This is attributed to the dehydrogenation ability of the loaded zinc species. The strong Lewis sites generated by zinc change the mechanism of alkane activation and transformation from beta scission to a dehydrogenation step.

In the case of Zn/H-BEA zeolite, the kinetic parameters for H/D exchange with alkanes change dramatically compared to H-BEA. The rate constants are at least two orders of magnitude higher, and the activation energy is much lower (86-88 kJ/mol). The exchange reaction proceeds at temperatures at least 100 K lower than on H-BEA.

The promoting effect of zinc in zeolites is attributed to the involvement of Zn-alkyl species in the exchange process. These species can be formed either on ZnO clusters or Zn2+ cations located on neighboring or remote SiO(-)Al groups in the zeolite framework.

These factors contribute to the industrial significance of metal-based catalysts in alkane transformations. The ability to lower reaction temperatures, increase reaction rates, and improve selectivity towards desired products (like aromatics) makes these catalysts attractive for industrial applications in processes such as oxidative dehydrogenation and zeolite-catalyzed reactions.
