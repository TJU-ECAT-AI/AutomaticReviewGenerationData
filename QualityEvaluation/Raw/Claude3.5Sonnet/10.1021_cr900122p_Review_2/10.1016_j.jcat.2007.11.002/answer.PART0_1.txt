[1] "Zn-modified zeolites are effective catalysts for light alkanes aromatization [1–4]. The enhanced selectivity of alkane conversion (ethane [5–7] and propane [8,9]) towards aromatics is attributed to dehydrogenation ability of the loaded zinc species."

[2] "It has been claimed [2,3] that strong Lewis sites, which are generated by zinc, change the mechanism of alkane activation and transformation from the beta scission to a dehydrogenation step."

[3] "Kazansky et al. [12–14] demonstrated the formation of strong adsorption complexes between small alkanes and Zn2+ cations by IR spectroscopy. They claimed that the activation of the alkane molecules in zeolite occurred on Zn2+ cations."

[4] "For Zn/H-BEA, the kinetic parameters of H/D exchange change dramatically. The rate constants kSiOHAl are at least two orders of magnitude higher. The activation energy of 86–88 kJ mol−1 is rather low. The exchange proceeds with a notable rate at temperatures at least 100 K lower compared to that on H-BEA."

[5] "The lower apparent activation energy for the exchange on Zn/H-BEA and the low temperature range of this reaction imply a promoting effect of Zn on the reaction of the H/D exchange. The mechanism of the exchange seems to be different from that usually accepted for pure acidic zeolites [17–28,55]."

The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts, particularly Zn-modified zeolites, significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations. Key factors include:

1. Zinc loading: The presence of zinc in zeolites enhances the selectivity of alkane conversion towards aromatics due to the dehydrogenation ability of zinc species.

2. Lewis acidity: Strong Lewis sites generated by zinc change the mechanism of alkane activation from beta scission to dehydrogenation.

3. Formation of adsorption complexes: Zn2+ cations form strong adsorption complexes with small alkanes, facilitating their activation.

4. Reaction kinetics: Zn-modified zeolites dramatically change the kinetics of H/D exchange, with rate constants at least two orders of magnitude higher and lower activation energies compared to unmodified zeolites.

5. Temperature range: Zn-modified zeolites allow reactions to proceed at temperatures at least 100 K lower than unmodified zeolites.

These factors contribute to the industrial significance of Zn-modified zeolites by enabling more efficient and selective alkane transformations at lower temperatures, potentially reducing energy costs and improving product yields in processes such as aromatization and dehydrogenation.

金属基催化剂的组成、结构和反应条件，特别是锌改性沸石，显著影响烷烃转化的机理和效率。主要因素包括：

1. 锌负载量：沸石中锌的存在增强了烷烃转化为芳烃的选择性，这归因于锌物种的脱氢能力。

2. 路易斯酸性：锌生成的强路易斯酸位改变了烷烃活化机理，从β裂解转变为脱氢步骤。

3. 吸附络合物的形成：Zn2+阳离子与小分子烷烃形成强吸附络合物，促进其活化。

4. 反应动力学：锌改性沸石显著改变了H/D交换的动力学，反应速率常数至少提高两个数量级，活化能也比未改性沸石低。

5. 温度范围：锌改性沸石允许反应在比未改性沸石至少低100 K的温度下进行。

这些因素通过实现更高效和选择性的烷烃转化，以及在更低温度下进行反应，为锌改性沸石的工业重要性做出贡献。这可能降低能源成本，并提高芳构化和脱氢等过程中的产品产率。
