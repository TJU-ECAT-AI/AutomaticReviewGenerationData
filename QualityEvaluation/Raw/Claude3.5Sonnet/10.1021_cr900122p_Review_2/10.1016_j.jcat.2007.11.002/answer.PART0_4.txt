[1] "Zn-modified zeolites are effective catalysts for light alkanes aromatization [14]. The enhanced selectivity of alkane conversion (ethane [57] and propane [8,9]) towards aromatics is attributed to dehydrogenation ability of the loaded zinc species."

[2] "It has been claimed [2,3] that strong Lewis sites, which are generated by zinc, change the mechanism of alkane activation and transformation from the beta scission to a dehydrogenation step."

[3] "For Zn/H-BEA, the kinetic parameters of H/D exchange change dramatically. The rate constants kSiOHAl are at least two orders of magnitude higher. The activation energy of 8688 kJ mol1 is rather low. The exchange proceeds with a notable rate at temperatures at least 100 K lower compared to that on H-BEA."

[4] "The promotion may consist of involvement of Zn-alkyl species in the exchange. They can be formed either on ZnO clusters or Zn2+ cations, located on neighbor or remote SiO()Al groups."

The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts like supported vanadium oxides and metal-exchanged zeolites significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations. 

For Zn-modified zeolites, the introduction of zinc species enhances the selectivity towards aromatics in light alkane aromatization processes. This is attributed to the dehydrogenation ability of the loaded zinc species. The strong Lewis sites generated by zinc change the mechanism of alkane activation and transformation from beta scission to a dehydrogenation step.

In the case of Zn/H-BEA zeolite, the kinetic parameters for H/D exchange with alkanes change dramatically compared to H-BEA. The rate constants are at least two orders of magnitude higher, and the activation energy is much lower (86-88 kJ/mol). The exchange reaction proceeds at temperatures at least 100 K lower than on H-BEA.

The promoting effect of zinc in zeolites is attributed to the involvement of Zn-alkyl species in the exchange process. These species can be formed either on ZnO clusters or Zn2+ cations located on neighboring or remote SiO(-)Al groups in the zeolite framework.

These factors contribute to the industrial significance of metal-based catalysts in alkane transformations. The ability to lower reaction temperatures, increase reaction rates, and improve selectivity towards desired products (like aromatics) makes these catalysts attractive for industrial applications in processes such as oxidative dehydrogenation and zeolite-catalyzed reactions.

金属基催化剂（如负载的钒氧化物和金属交换的沸石）的组成、结构和反应条件显著影响烷烃转化的机理和效率。

对于锌改性沸石，锌物种的引入增强了轻烷烃芳构化过程中对芳烃的选择性。这归因于负载的锌物种的脱氢能力。锌产生的强Lewis酸位改变了烷烃活化和转化的机理，从β-裂解转变为脱氢步骤。

在Zn/H-BEA沸石的情况下，与烷烃进行H/D交换的动力学参数与H-BEA相比发生了显著变化。反应速率常数至少提高了两个数量级，活化能大大降低（86-88 kJ/mol）。交换反应在比H-BEA低至少100 K的温度下就能以显著的速率进行。

沸石中锌的促进作用归因于Zn-烷基物种参与交换过程。这些物种可以在ZnO簇或位于沸石框架中相邻或远程SiO(-)Al基团上的Zn2+阳离子上形成。

这些因素促进了金属基催化剂在烷烃转化中的工业重要性。降低反应温度、提高反应速率和改善对所需产品（如芳烃）的选择性的能力使这些催化剂在氧化脱氢和沸石催化反应等工业应用中具有吸引力。
