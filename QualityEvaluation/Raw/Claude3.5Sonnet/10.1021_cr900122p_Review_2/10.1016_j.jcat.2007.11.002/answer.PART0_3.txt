[1] "Zn-modified zeolites are effective catalysts for light alkanes aromatization [14]. The enhanced selectivity of alkane conversion (ethane [57] and propane [8,9]) towards aromatics is attributed to dehydrogenation ability of the loaded zinc species."

[2] "It has been claimed [2,3] that strong Lewis sites, which are generated by zinc, change the mechanism of alkane activation and transformation from the beta scission to a dehydrogenation step."

[3] "For Zn/H-BEA, the kinetic parameters of H/D exchange change dramatically. The rate constants kSiOHAl are at least two orders of magnitude higher. The activation energy of 8688 kJ mol1 is rather low. The exchange proceeds with a notable rate at temperatures at least 100 K lower compared to that on H-BEA."

[4] "The promotion may consist of involvement of Zn-alkyl species in the exchange. They can be formed either on ZnO clusters or Zn2+ cations, located on neighbor or remote SiO()Al groups."

The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations:

1. Zinc-modified zeolites are effective catalysts for light alkane aromatization. The addition of zinc species enhances the selectivity towards aromatics by promoting dehydrogenation.

2. Strong Lewis acid sites generated by zinc change the mechanism of alkane activation from beta scission to dehydrogenation, which is more favorable for aromatization.

3. In Zn/H-BEA catalysts, the kinetics of H/D exchange are dramatically altered compared to H-BEA:
   - Rate constants are at least two orders of magnitude higher
   - Activation energy is much lower (86-88 kJ/mol)
   - Reactions proceed at temperatures 100 K lower than H-BEA

4. The promoting effect of zinc is attributed to the involvement of Zn-alkyl species in the exchange mechanism. These species can form on ZnO clusters or Zn2+ cations located on SiO()Al groups in the zeolite framework.

These factors contribute to the industrial significance of metal-modified zeolites by improving catalytic performance, allowing milder reaction conditions, and enhancing selectivity towards desired products like aromatics. The ability to fine-tune catalyst properties through metal loading and distribution offers versatility in designing catalysts for specific alkane transformation processes.

金属基催化剂的组成、结构和反应条件显著影响烷烃转化的机理和效率：

1. 锌改性沸石是轻烷烃芳构化的有效催化剂。添加锌物种通过促进脱氢来提高芳烃的选择性。

2. 锌产生的强Lewis酸位将烷烃活化机理从β-裂解改变为脱氢，这更有利于芳构化。

3. 在Zn/H-BEA催化剂中，H/D交换的动力学与H-BEA相比发生了显著变化：
   - 速率常数至少提高了两个数量级
   - 活化能大大降低（86-88 kJ/mol）
   - 反应温度比H-BEA低100 K

4. 锌的促进作用归因于Zn-烷基物种参与交换机理。这些物种可以在沸石骨架中的ZnO簇或位于SiO()Al基团上的Zn2+阳离子上形成。

这些因素通过改善催化性能、允许更温和的反应条件以及提高对所需产物（如芳烃）的选择性，增加了金属改性沸石的工业重要性。通过金属负载和分布来微调催化剂性质的能力为特定烷烃转化过程设计催化剂提供了多样性。
