[1] "Zn-modified zeolites are effective catalysts for light alkanes aromatization [14]. The enhanced selectivity of alkane conversion (ethane [57] and propane [8,9]) towards aromatics is attributed to dehydrogenation ability of the loaded zinc species."

[2] "It has been claimed [2,3] that strong Lewis sites, which are generated by zinc, change the mechanism of alkane activation and transformation from the beta scission to a dehydrogenation step."

[3] "For Zn/H-BEA, the kinetic parameters of H/D exchange change dramatically. The rate constants kSiOHAl are at least two orders of magnitude higher. The activation energy of 8688 kJ mol1 is rather low."

[4] "The lower apparent activation energy for the exchange on Zn/H-BEA and the low temperature range of this reaction imply a promoting effect of Zn on the reaction of the H/D exchange."

[5] "We propose that the mechanism of the H/D exchange on Zn/H-BEA involves Zn-alkyl species as intermediates."

The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts, particularly Zn-modified zeolites, significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations. 

For Zn-modified zeolites:
1. They are effective catalysts for light alkane aromatization.
2. The loaded zinc species enhance selectivity towards aromatics through their dehydrogenation ability.
3. Strong Lewis sites generated by zinc change the mechanism of alkane activation from beta scission to dehydrogenation.
4. In H/D exchange reactions, Zn/H-BEA shows dramatically different kinetic parameters compared to H-BEA:
   - Rate constants are at least two orders of magnitude higher
   - Activation energy is much lower (86-88 kJ/mol)
   - Reactions occur at lower temperatures
5. The promoting effect of Zn is attributed to the involvement of Zn-alkyl species as intermediates in the reaction mechanism.

These factors contribute to the industrial significance of Zn-modified zeolites by improving catalytic performance, increasing reaction rates, lowering activation energies, and enabling reactions to occur under milder conditions. The ability to tune catalytic properties through metal loading and modification of zeolites allows for the development of more efficient and selective catalysts for alkane transformations, including oxidative dehydrogenation and other zeolite-catalyzed reactions.

金属基催化剂的组成、结构和反应条件，特别是锌改性沸石，显著影响烷烃转化的机理和效率。

对于锌改性沸石：
1. 它们是轻烷烃芳构化的有效催化剂。
2. 负载的锌物种通过其脱氢能力增强了对芳烃的选择性。
3. 锌产生的强Lewis酸位改变了烷烃活化机理，从β裂解转变为脱氢。
4. 在H/D交换反应中，Zn/H-BEA与H-BEA相比显示出显著不同的动力学参数：
   - 反应速率常数至少高两个数量级
   - 活化能显著降低（86-88 kJ/mol）
   - 反应在较低温度下进行
5. 锌的促进作用被归因于反应机理中锌-烷基物种作为中间体的参与。

这些因素通过提高催化性能、增加反应速率、降低活化能和使反应在较温和条件下进行，提高了锌改性沸石的工业重要性。通过金属负载和沸石改性来调节催化性能的能力，使得开发更高效和选择性的烷烃转化催化剂成为可能，包括氧化脱氢和其他沸石催化反应。
