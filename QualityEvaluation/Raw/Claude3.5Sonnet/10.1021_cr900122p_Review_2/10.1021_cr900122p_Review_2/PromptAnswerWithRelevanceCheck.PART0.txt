[1] "Supported vanadium oxides are particularly noteworthy because the active sites possibly involve isolated VO species (in contrast to the other systems based on MoOx or WOx)."

[2] "Overall, silica can be regarded as the optimal support in terms of selectivity."

[3] "Another important fact is that the optimal temperature window for this process is quite narrow, and around 500 C, lower temperatures favor combustion while unselective gas phase reactions start to be competitive at higher temperatures (>550 C)."

[4] "Metal exchange zeolites (M-zeolites) have concentrated a large research effort, because of their ability to transform alkanes into alkenes and aromatics."

[5] "For instance, the Cyclar and related processes (aroforming or Z-forming) typically use Ga-zeolite to convert in a single step liquefied petroleum gas (LPG), composed of propane and butane, into H2 and liquid aromatics, i.e., benzene, toluene, and xylenes."

[6] "Ga-zeolites act as a multifunctional catalyst, and one of the key steps, the formation of alkenes from alkanes, takes place at Ga sites and involves a CH bond activation and formation of a Gaalkyl intermediate."

The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations. 

For supported vanadium oxides in oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH):

1. Composition: Isolated VO species are believed to be the active sites, contrasting with MoOx or WOx systems.

2. Structure: Silica is considered the optimal support for selectivity.

3. Reaction conditions: The optimal temperature window is narrow, around 500°C. Lower temperatures favor combustion, while higher temperatures (>550°C) lead to unselective gas-phase reactions.

For metal-exchanged zeolites:

1. Composition: Various metals can be used, including Ga, Zn, Mo, and others. Ga- and Zn-zeolites are particularly notable for their industrial relevance.

2. Structure: Different zeolite structures (e.g., MFI, MOR, ZSM-5) can be used, with the metal species occupying specific sites within the zeolite framework.

3. Reaction mechanisms: These catalysts can transform alkanes into alkenes and aromatics through processes involving CH bond activation and formation of metal-alkyl intermediates.

The industrial significance of these catalysts is demonstrated by processes like Cyclar, which uses Ga-zeolites to convert liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) into hydrogen and liquid aromatics in a single step. This process showcases the multifunctional nature of the catalyst, combining dehydrogenation, oligomerization, and cyclization steps.

Both supported vanadium oxides and metal-exchanged zeolites offer efficient routes for alkane transformation, with their specific compositions and structures allowing for tuning of catalytic properties. The ability to control reaction conditions, particularly temperature in the case of supported vanadium oxides, is crucial for optimizing selectivity and efficiency in these processes.

金属基催化剂的组成、结构和反应条件对烷烃转化的机理和效率有显著影响。

对于氧化脱氢(ODH)中的负载钒氧化物：

1. 组成：孤立的VO物种被认为是活性位点，这与基于MoOx或WOx的其他系统形成对比。

2. 结构：二氧化硅被认为是最佳的选择性载体。

3. 反应条件：最佳温度窗口很窄，约为500°C。较低的温度有利于燃烧，而较高的温度（>550°C）会导致非选择性气相反应。

对于金属交换沸石：

1. 组成：可以使用各种金属，包括Ga、Zn、Mo等。Ga和Zn沸石因其工业相关性而特别引人注目。

2. 结构：可以使用不同的沸石结构（如MFI、MOR、ZSM-5），金属物种占据沸石骨架中的特定位置。

3. 反应机理：这些催化剂可以通过涉及CH键活化和形成金属-烷基中间体的过程将烷烃转化为烯烃和芳烃。

这些催化剂的工业重要性通过诸如Cyclar等过程得到了证明，该过程使用Ga沸石在单个步骤中将液化石油气（LPG）转化为氢气和液体芳烃。这一过程展示了催化剂的多功能性，结合了脱氢、低聚和环化步骤。

负载钒氧化物和金属交换沸石都为烷烃转化提供了高效的途径，它们的特定组成和结构允许调整催化性能。控制反应条件的能力，特别是在负载钒氧化物情况下的温度控制，对于优化这些过程中的选择性和效率至关重要。
