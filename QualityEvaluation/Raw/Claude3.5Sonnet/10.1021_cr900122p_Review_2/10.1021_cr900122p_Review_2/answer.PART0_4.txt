[1] "Supported vanadium oxides are particularly noteworthy because the active sites possibly involve isolated VO species (in contrast to the other systems based on MoOx or WOx). In fact, both too low and too high surface V densities are detrimental to high selectivities, and this has been associated with the combustion of the thus-formed alkenes into COx on the support and/or the polymeric V species."

[2] "Overall, silica can be regarded as the optimal support in terms of selectivity. Another important fact is that the optimal temperature window for this process is quite narrow, and around 500 C, lower temperatures favor combustion while unselective gas phase reactions start to be competitive at higher temperatures (>550 C)."

[3] "Metal exchange zeolites (M-zeolites) have concentrated a large research effort, because of their ability to transform alkanes into alkenes and aromatics. They can also be used to catalyze the alkylation of aromatics with methane, the coaromatization of methane and alkanes, and the direct aromatization of methane"

[4] "Ga-zeolites act as a multifunctional catalyst, and one of the key steps, the formation of alkenes from alkanes, takes place at Ga sites and involves a CH bond activation and formation of a Gaalkyl intermediate."

[5] "Zn-zeolites display a very similar reactivity pattern: H2 and alkane activation, H/D exchange, formation of aromatics from alkanes, and the coaromatization of methane and alkane."

The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations:

For supported vanadium oxides:
- Active sites involve isolated VO species
- Surface V density affects selectivity, with both low and high densities reducing selectivity
- Silica is considered the optimal support for selectivity
- Temperature window is narrow, around 500°C, with lower temperatures favoring combustion and higher temperatures leading to unselective gas phase reactions

For metal-exchanged zeolites:
- They can transform alkanes into alkenes and aromatics
- Various structures (MFI, MOR, ZSM-5) and compositions are possible
- Can include a wide range of metals (Al, Ga, Cu, Fe, Mn, Mo, Pt, W, Zn)
- Ga-zeolites act as multifunctional catalysts, with CH bond activation and Ga-alkyl intermediate formation
- Zn-zeolites show similar reactivity patterns to Ga-zeolites

These catalysts are industrially significant due to their ability to perform various alkane transformations, including oxidative dehydrogenation, alkylation of aromatics, coaromatization of methane and alkanes, and direct aromatization of methane. The Cyclar process, which uses Ga-zeolites to convert LPG into hydrogen and liquid aromatics, is a notable industrial application.

金属基催化剂的成分、结构和反应条件显著影响烷烃转化的机理和效率：

对于负载型钒氧化物：
- 活性位点涉及孤立的VO物种
- 表面V密度影响选择性，过低和过高的密度都会降低选择性
- 二氧化硅被认为是最佳的选择性支撑材料
- 温度窗口较窄，约为500°C，较低温度有利于燃烧，较高温度会导致非选择性气相反应

对于金属交换沸石：
- 它们可以将烷烃转化为烯烃和芳烃
- 可能有各种结构（MFI、MOR、ZSM-5）和成分
- 可以包含多种金属（Al、Ga、Cu、Fe、Mn、Mo、Pt、W、Zn）
- Ga沸石作为多功能催化剂，涉及CH键活化和Ga-烷基中间体形成
- Zn沸石显示出与Ga沸石相似的反应模式

这些催化剂在工业上具有重要意义，因为它们能够执行各种烷烃转化，包括氧化脱氢、芳烃的烷基化、甲烷和烷烃的共芳构化以及甲烷的直接芳构化。使用Ga沸石将液化石油气转化为氢气和液态芳烃的Cyclar工艺是一个显著的工业应用。
