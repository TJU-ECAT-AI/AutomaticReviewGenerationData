[1] "Supported vanadium oxides are particularly noteworthy because the active sites possibly involve isolated VO species (in contrast to the other systems based on MoOx or WOx). In fact, both too low and too high surface V densities are detrimental to high selectivities, and this has been associated with the combustion of the thus-formed alkenes into COx on the support and/or the polymeric V species."

[2] "Overall, silica can be regarded as the optimal support in terms of selectivity. Another important fact is that the optimal temperature window for this process is quite narrow, and around 500 C, lower temperatures favor combustion while unselective gas phase reactions start to be competitive at higher temperatures (>550 C)."

[3] "Metal exchange zeolites (M-zeolites) have concentrated a large research effort, because of their ability to transform alkanes into alkenes and aromatics. They can also be used to catalyze the alkylation of aromatics with methane, the coaromatization of methane and alkanes, and the direct aromatization of methane"

[4] "For instance, the Cyclar and related processes (aroforming or Z-forming) typically use Ga-zeolite to convert in a single step liquefied petroleum gas (LPG), composed of propane and butane, into H2 and liquid aromatics, i.e., benzene, toluene, and xylenes."

[5] "Zn-zeolites display a very similar reactivity pattern: H2 and alkane activation, H/D exchange, formation of aromatics from alkanes, and the coaromatization of methane and alkane."

The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations:

For supported vanadium oxides:
- Active sites involve isolated VO species
- Surface V density affects selectivity - both too low and too high densities are detrimental
- Silica is considered the optimal support for selectivity
- Narrow optimal temperature window around 500°C - lower temperatures favor combustion, higher temperatures lead to unselective gas phase reactions

For metal-exchanged zeolites:
- Can transform alkanes into alkenes and aromatics
- Catalyze various reactions including alkylation of aromatics with methane, coaromatization of methane and alkanes, and direct aromatization of methane
- Ga-zeolites are used in industrial processes like Cyclar to convert LPG into H2 and liquid aromatics
- Zn-zeolites show similar reactivity, including H2 and alkane activation, H/D exchange, and formation of aromatics from alkanes

These catalysts are industrially significant due to their ability to efficiently transform alkanes into more valuable products like alkenes and aromatics. The Cyclar process using Ga-zeolites is a notable example of industrial application. The ability to control selectivity and product distribution through catalyst composition and reaction conditions makes these systems versatile and valuable for various alkane transformation processes.

金属基催化剂的组成、结构和反应条件显著影响烷烃转化的机理和效率：

对于负载型钒氧化物：
- 活性位点涉及孤立的VO物种
- 表面V密度影响选择性 - 密度过低或过高都不利
- 二氧化硅被认为是最佳的选择性载体
- 最佳温度窗口较窄，约为500°C - 较低温度有利于燃烧，较高温度导致非选择性气相反应

对于金属交换沸石：
- 可以将烷烃转化为烯烃和芳烃
- 催化各种反应，包括甲烷与芳烃的烷基化、甲烷和烷烃的共芳构化以及甲烷的直接芳构化
- 镓沸石用于工业过程如Cyclar，将液化石油气转化为氢气和液体芳烃
- 锌沸石显示类似的反应活性，包括氢气和烷烃活化、氢/氘交换以及从烷烃形成芳烃

这些催化剂在工业上具有重要意义，因为它们能够有效地将烷烃转化为更有价值的产品，如烯烃和芳烃。使用镓沸石的Cyclar过程是工业应用的一个显著例子。通过催化剂组成和反应条件控制选择性和产品分布的能力使这些系统在各种烷烃转化过程中具有多功能性和价值。
