[1] "Supported vanadium oxides are particularly noteworthy because the active sites possibly involve isolated VO species (in contrast to the other systems based on MoOx or WOx)."

[2] "Both too low and too high surface V densities are detrimental to high selectivities, and this has been associated with the combustion of the thus-formed alkenes into COx on the support and/or the polymeric V species."

[3] "Small clusters and particularly isolated sites on fully covered oxide surfaces have been proposed to be essential to achieve high selectivities. It is therefore not surprising that the support is an important component in the catalyst formulation, as it can more or less stabilize isolated centers, small clusters vs larger V2O5 crystallites."

[4] "Overall, silica can be regarded as the optimal support in terms of selectivity. Another important fact is that the optimal temperature window for this process is quite narrow, and around 500 C, lower temperatures favor combustion while unselective gas phase reactions start to be competitive at higher temperatures (>550 C)."

[5] "Metal exchange zeolites (M-zeolites) have concentrated a large research effort, because of their ability to transform alkanes into alkenes and aromatics."

[6] "These M-zeolites can be of various structures (typically identified with three letter codes: MFI, MOR, ZSM-5...) and compositions, and can include a wide range of metals M, ranging from main group (Al, Ga) to transition-metal elements (Cu, Fe, Mn, Mo, Pt, W, Zn, ...)."

[7] "For instance, the Cyclar and related processes (aroforming or Z-forming) typically use Ga-zeolite to convert in a single step liquefied petroleum gas (LPG), composed of propane and butane, into H2 and liquid aromatics, i.e., benzene, toluene, and xylenes."

The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations. For supported vanadium oxides in oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH):

1. Composition: Isolated VO species are believed to be the active sites, with both too low and too high surface V densities negatively impacting selectivity.

2. Structure: Small clusters and isolated sites on fully covered oxide surfaces are essential for high selectivity. The support plays a crucial role in stabilizing these structures, with silica being considered the optimal support.

3. Reaction conditions: The optimal temperature window is narrow, around 500°C. Lower temperatures favor combustion, while higher temperatures (>550°C) lead to unselective gas-phase reactions.

For metal-exchanged zeolites:

1. Composition: A wide range of metals can be used, including main group (Al, Ga) and transition metals (Cu, Fe, Mn, Mo, Pt, W, Zn).

2. Structure: Zeolites can have various structures (e.g., MFI, MOR, ZSM-5) that influence their catalytic properties.

3. Industrial significance: Ga-zeolites are used in industrial processes like Cyclar to convert LPG into hydrogen and liquid aromatics in a single step.

These factors contribute to the industrial significance of these catalysts by enabling efficient and selective transformations of alkanes into valuable products such as alkenes and aromatics.

金属基催化剂的组成、结构和反应条件显著影响烷烃转化的机理和效率。对于氧化脱氢(ODH)中的负载型钒氧化物：

1. 组成：单独的VO物种被认为是活性位点，过低或过高的表面V密度都会对选择性产生负面影响。

2. 结构：完全覆盖的氧化物表面上的小簇和孤立位点对高选择性至关重要。载体在稳定这些结构方面起着关键作用，其中二氧化硅被认为是最佳载体。

3. 反应条件：最佳温度窗口较窄，约为500°C。较低的温度有利于燃烧，而较高的温度（>550°C）会导致非选择性的气相反应。

对于金属交换沸石：

1. 组成：可以使用多种金属，包括主族元素（Al，Ga）和过渡金属（Cu，Fe，Mn，Mo，Pt，W，Zn）。

2. 结构：沸石可以有各种结构（例如MFI，MOR，ZSM-5），这些结构影响其催化性能。

3. 工业意义：Ga沸石在Cyclar等工业过程中用于将LPG一步转化为氢气和液体芳烃。

这些因素通过实现烷烃向有价值产品（如烯烃和芳烃）的高效和选择性转化，为这些催化剂的工业重要性做出了贡献。
