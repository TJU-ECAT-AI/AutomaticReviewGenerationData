[1] "Supported vanadium oxides are particularly noteworthy because the active sites possibly involve isolated VO species (in contrast to the other systems based on MoOx or WOx). In fact, both too low and too high surface V densities are detrimental to high selectivities, and this has been associated with the combustion of the thus-formed alkenes into COx on the support and/or the polymeric V species."

[2] "Overall, silica can be regarded as the optimal support in terms of selectivity. Another important fact is that the optimal temperature window for this process is quite narrow, and around 500 C, lower temperatures favor combustion while unselective gas phase reactions start to be competitive at higher temperatures (>550 C)."

[3] "Metal exchange zeolites (M-zeolites) have concentrated a large research effort, because of their ability to transform alkanes into alkenes and aromatics. They can also be used to catalyze the alkylation of aromatics with methane, the coaromatization of methane and alkanes, and the direct aromatization of methane"

[4] "Ga-zeolites act as a multifunctional catalyst, and one of the key steps, the formation of alkenes from alkanes, takes place at Ga sites and involves a CH bond activation and formation of a Gaalkyl intermediate."

[5] "Zn-zeolites display a very similar reactivity pattern: H2 and alkane activation, H/D exchange, formation of aromatics from alkanes, and the coaromatization of methane and alkane."

The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations.

For supported vanadium oxides in oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH):
- Isolated VO species are the active sites
- Surface V density is crucial; both too low and too high densities reduce selectivity
- Silica is considered the optimal support for selectivity
- The optimal temperature window is narrow, around 500°C

For metal-exchanged zeolites:
- They can transform alkanes into alkenes and aromatics
- Various structures (MFI, MOR, ZSM-5) and compositions are possible
- Different metals (Al, Ga, Cu, Fe, Mn, Mo, Pt, W, Zn) can be used
- Ga-zeolites act as multifunctional catalysts, with CH bond activation at Ga sites forming Ga-alkyl intermediates
- Zn-zeolites show similar reactivity, including H2 and alkane activation, H/D exchange, and formation of aromatics from alkanes

The industrial significance of these catalysts stems from their ability to perform various transformations, such as:
- Conversion of LPG to aromatics (Cyclar process using Ga-zeolites)
- Direct aromatization of methane
- Alkylation of aromatics with methane
- Coaromatization of methane and alkanes

These processes offer routes to valuable chemical products from readily available alkane feedstocks, making them industrially important.

金属基催化剂的组成、结构和反应条件显著影响烷烃转化的机理和效率。

对于氧化脱氢(ODH)中的负载型钒氧化物：
- 孤立的VO物种是活性位点
- 表面V密度至关重要；密度过高或过低都会降低选择性
- 二氧化硅被认为是最佳的载体，可获得最高的选择性
- 最佳温度窗口较窄，约为500°C

对于金属交换沸石：
- 它们可以将烷烃转化为烯烃和芳烃
- 可能有各种结构(MFI, MOR, ZSM-5)和成分
- 可以使用不同的金属(Al, Ga, Cu, Fe, Mn, Mo, Pt, W, Zn)
- Ga-沸石作为多功能催化剂，在Ga位点上发生CH键活化，形成Ga-烷基中间体
- Zn-沸石显示类似的反应活性，包括H2和烷烃活化、H/D交换以及从烷烃形成芳烃

这些催化剂的工业重要性源于它们能够进行各种转化，例如：
- 将LPG转化为芳烃(使用Ga-沸石的Cyclar工艺)
- 甲烷的直接芳构化
- 芳烃与甲烷的烷基化
- 甲烷和烷烃的共芳构化

这些过程为从易得的烷烃原料生产有价值的化学品提供了途径，使它们在工业上具有重要意义。
