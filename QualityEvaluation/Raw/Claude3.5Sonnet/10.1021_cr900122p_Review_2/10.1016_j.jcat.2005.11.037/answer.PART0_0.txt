[1] "The initial step in propane activation over Zn/H-MFI is dissociative adsorption over zinc oxide sites, leading to the formation of propyl zinc species and ZnOH groups."

[2] "At low partial pressure of the reactants, H2 recombinative desorption and hydrogen evolution is favoured, whereas at high pressures, implied under NMR batch conditions, the hydrogenolysis route is preferred."

[3] "The mechanism proposed for propane activation involves propane dissociation, followed by propene evolution and recombinative desorption of dihydrogen. Propene further oligomerizes over acidic sites, while dihydrogen either evolves as a final product or participates in propane hydrogenolysis into ethane and methane."

[4] "This mechanistic pathway explains the higher activity of Zn/H-MFI catalysts with respect to H-MFI and the lower selectivity to aromatics in comparison to Ga/H-MFI."

The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations. For Zn/H-MFI catalysts:

1. Composition: The presence of zinc oxide sites and acidic sites in the catalyst enables a bifunctional mechanism for propane activation and subsequent reactions.

2. Structure: The MFI zeolite framework provides a suitable environment for both zinc oxide species and acidic sites, allowing for the dissociative adsorption of propane and further oligomerization of propene.

3. Reaction conditions: The partial pressure of reactants plays a crucial role in determining the reaction pathway. Low partial pressures favor hydrogen evolution, while high pressures promote the hydrogenolysis route.

The mechanism involves initial dissociative adsorption of propane on zinc oxide sites, followed by propene evolution and recombinative desorption of dihydrogen. Propene then oligomerizes over acidic sites, while dihydrogen either evolves as a final product or participates in propane hydrogenolysis.

This mechanistic pathway contributes to the industrial significance of Zn/H-MFI catalysts by providing higher activity compared to H-MFI catalysts. However, it also results in lower selectivity to aromatics compared to Ga/H-MFI catalysts due to enhanced ethane and methane formation through hydrogenolysis.

The study demonstrates how the interplay between metal sites (zinc oxide) and acidic sites in the zeolite framework, along with reaction conditions, can be tuned to influence the catalytic performance in alkane transformations.

金属基催化剂的组成、结构和反应条件显著影响烷烃转化的机理和效率。对于Zn/H-MFI催化剂：

1. 组成：催化剂中氧化锌位点和酸性位点的存在使丙烷活化和后续反应能够通过双功能机理进行。

2. 结构：MFI沸石骨架为氧化锌物种和酸性位点提供了适宜的环境，允许丙烷的解离吸附和丙烯的进一步寡聚。

3. 反应条件：反应物的分压在决定反应途径中起着关键作用。低分压有利于氢气演化，而高压则促进氢解路径。

该机理涉及丙烷在氧化锌位点上的初始解离吸附，随后是丙烯的演化和二氢的重组脱附。丙烯然后在酸性位点上寡聚，而二氢要么作为最终产物演化，要么参与丙烷的氢解。

这种机理途径通过提供比H-MFI催化剂更高的活性，提高了Zn/H-MFI催化剂的工业重要性。然而，由于通过氢解反应增强了乙烷和甲烷的形成，它也导致了与Ga/H-MFI催化剂相比芳烃选择性的降低。

该研究表明，沸石骨架中金属位点（氧化锌）和酸性位点之间的相互作用，以及反应条件，如何可以被调节以影响烷烃转化中的催化性能。
