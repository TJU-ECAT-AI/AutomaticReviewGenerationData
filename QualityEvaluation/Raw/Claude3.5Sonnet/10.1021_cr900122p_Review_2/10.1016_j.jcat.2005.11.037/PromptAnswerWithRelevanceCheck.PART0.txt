[1] "The initial step in propane activation over Zn/H-MFI is dissociative adsorption over zinc oxide sites, leading to the formation of propyl zinc species and ZnOH groups."

[2] "At low partial pressure of the reactants, H2 recombinative desorption and hydrogen evolution is favoured, whereas at high pressures, implied under NMR batch conditions, the hydrogenolysis route is preferred."

[3] "The mechanism proposed for propane activation involves propane dissociation, followed by propene evolution and recombinative desorption of dihydrogen. Propene further oligomerizes over acidic sites, while dihydrogen either evolves as a final product or participates in propane hydrogenolysis into ethane and methane."

[4] "This mechanistic pathway explains the higher activity of Zn/H-MFI catalysts with respect to H-MFI and the lower selectivity to aromatics in comparison to Ga/H-MFI."

The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations. For Zn/H-MFI catalysts:

1. Composition: The presence of zinc oxide sites and acidic sites in the catalyst enables a bifunctional mechanism for propane activation and subsequent reactions.

2. Structure: The MFI zeolite framework provides a suitable environment for both zinc oxide species and acidic sites, allowing for the dissociative adsorption of propane and further oligomerization of propene.

3. Reaction conditions: The partial pressure of reactants plays a crucial role in determining the reaction pathway. Low partial pressures favor hydrogen evolution, while high pressures promote the hydrogenolysis route.

The mechanism involves initial dissociative adsorption of propane on zinc oxide sites, followed by propene evolution and recombinative desorption of dihydrogen. Propene then oligomerizes over acidic sites, while dihydrogen either evolves as a final product or participates in propane hydrogenolysis.

This mechanistic pathway contributes to the industrial significance of Zn/H-MFI catalysts by providing higher activity compared to H-MFI catalysts. However, it also results in lower selectivity to aromatics compared to Ga/H-MFI catalysts due to enhanced ethane and methane formation through hydrogenolysis.

The study demonstrates how the interplay between metal sites (zinc oxide) and acidic sites in the zeolite framework, along with reaction conditions, can be tuned to influence the catalytic performance in alkane transformations.

金属基催化剂的组成、结构和反应条件显著影响烷烃转化的机理和效率。对于Zn/H-MFI催化剂：

1. 组成：催化剂中氧化锌位点和酸性位点的存在使丙烷活化和后续反应能够通过双功能机理进行。

2. 结构：MFI沸石骨架为氧化锌物种和酸性位点提供了适宜的环境，允许丙烷的解离吸附和丙烯的进一步寡聚。

3. 反应条件：反应物的分压在决定反应途径中起着关键作用。低分压有利于氢气演化，而高压则促进氢解路径。

该机理涉及丙烷在氧化锌位点上的初始解离吸附，随后是丙烯的演化和二氢的重组脱附。丙烯然后在酸性位点上寡聚，而二氢要么作为最终产物演化，要么参与丙烷的氢解。

这种机理途径通过提供比H-MFI催化剂更高的活性，提高了Zn/H-MFI催化剂的工业重要性。然而，由于通过氢解反应增强了乙烷和甲烷的形成，它也导致了与Ga/H-MFI催化剂相比芳烃选择性的降低。

该研究表明，沸石骨架中金属位点（氧化锌）和酸性位点之间的相互作用，以及反应条件，如何可以被调节以影响烷烃转化中的催化性能。

The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations. For Zn/H-MFI catalysts, the initial step in propane activation involves dissociative adsorption over zinc oxide sites, forming propyl zinc species and ZnOH groups. This mechanism differs from that of Ga/H-MFI catalysts.

Reaction conditions, particularly pressure, affect the reaction pathway. At low partial pressures, H2 recombinative desorption and hydrogen evolution are favored, while at high pressures, hydrogenolysis is preferred. This flexibility in reaction pathways contributes to the industrial significance of these catalysts.

The mechanistic differences between Zn/H-MFI and Ga/H-MFI catalysts result in varying catalytic performance. Zn/H-MFI catalysts show higher activity compared to H-MFI but lower selectivity to aromatics than Ga/H-MFI. This balance of activity and selectivity is crucial for optimizing industrial processes.

The study demonstrates how the choice of metal (Zn vs Ga) in zeolite catalysts can dramatically alter the reaction mechanism and product distribution. This understanding allows for tailoring catalysts to specific industrial needs, whether prioritizing overall activity or selectivity towards certain products.

金属基催化剂的成分、结构和反应条件显著影响烷烃转化的机理和效率。对于Zn/H-MFI催化剂，丙烷活化的初始步骤涉及在氧化锌位点上的解离吸附，形成丙基锌物种和ZnOH基团。这种机理与Ga/H-MFI催化剂不同。

反应条件，特别是压力，会影响反应途径。在低分压下，H2重组脱附和氢气演化是有利的，而在高压下，则倾向于氢解。这种反应途径的灵活性有助于这些催化剂的工业重要性。

Zn/H-MFI和Ga/H-MFI催化剂之间的机理差异导致催化性能不同。与H-MFI相比，Zn/H-MFI催化剂显示出更高的活性，但对芳烃的选择性低于Ga/H-MFI。这种活性和选择性的平衡对于优化工业过程至关重要。

该研究表明，在沸石催化剂中选择金属（Zn vs Ga）可以显著改变反应机理和产物分布。这种理解允许根据特定的工业需求定制催化剂，无论是优先考虑整体活性还是对某些产品的选择性。

The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations. For Zn/H-MFI catalysts:

1. Composition: The presence of zinc oxide sites enables dissociative adsorption of propane, forming propyl zinc species and ZnOH groups. The acidic sites in the zeolite structure facilitate subsequent oligomerization of propene.

2. Structure: The MFI zeolite structure provides a framework for dispersing zinc species and creating acid sites, which work together in the catalytic process.

3. Reaction conditions: Pressure plays a crucial role in determining the reaction pathway. At low partial pressures, H2 recombinative desorption and hydrogen evolution are favored. At high pressures, the hydrogenolysis route is preferred, leading to ethane and methane formation.

These factors contribute to the industrial significance of Zn/H-MFI catalysts by:

1. Increasing activity compared to H-MFI catalysts in propane conversion.
2. Providing a different selectivity profile compared to Ga/H-MFI catalysts, with lower selectivity to aromatics.
3. Offering flexibility in product distribution based on reaction conditions, allowing for tuning of the process towards desired products.

The mechanistic insights gained from studying these catalysts can guide the development of more efficient and selective catalysts for industrial alkane transformation processes.

The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations. For Zn/H-MFI catalysts:

1. Composition: The presence of zinc oxide sites and acidic sites in the catalyst enables a two-step mechanism for propane activation and transformation.

2. Structure: The zeolite structure provides both zinc oxide sites for initial propane dissociation and acidic sites for subsequent oligomerization of propene.

3. Reaction conditions: Pressure plays a crucial role in determining the reaction pathway. Low partial pressures favor hydrogen evolution, while high pressures promote hydrogenolysis.

This mechanism results in higher activity compared to H-MFI catalysts but lower selectivity to aromatics than Ga/H-MFI catalysts. The industrial significance of these catalysts stems from their ability to activate propane at relatively low temperatures and their tunable selectivity based on reaction conditions.

While the literature doesn't specifically discuss oxidative dehydrogenation or supported vanadium oxides, the insights gained from the Zn/H-MFI system demonstrate how metal-based catalysts can be tailored to achieve desired alkane transformations. The balance between metal sites (for initial activation) and acid sites (for further transformations) appears to be a key factor in determining catalyst performance and product selectivity.

1. 组成：催化剂中氧化锌位点和酸性位点的存在使丙烷活化和转化的两步机理成为可能。

2. 结构：沸石结构提供了初始丙烷解离的氧化锌位点和随后丙烯低聚的酸性位点。

3. 反应条件：压力在决定反应途径中起着关键作用。低分压有利于氢气演化，而高压促进氢解。

这种机理导致与H-MFI催化剂相比活性更高，但与Ga/H-MFI催化剂相比芳烃选择性较低。这些催化剂的工业意义在于它们能够在相对较低的温度下活化丙烷，并且基于反应条件可以调节选择性。

虽然文献没有具体讨论氧化脱氢或负载的钒氧化物，但从Zn/H-MFI系统获得的见解表明，如何可以调整金属基催化剂以实现所需的烷烃转化。金属位点（用于初始活化）和酸性位点（用于进一步转化）之间的平衡似乎是决定催化剂性能和产品选择性的关键因素。

[1] "The development of in situ MAS NMR spectroscopic techniques [11] has allowed monitoring of the catalytic transformations directly on a catalyst surface during the course of the reaction."

[2] "Application of in situ 13C MAS NMR spectroscopy has enabled identification of the proposed detailed bifunctional mechanism of propane activation over Ga-modified acidic MFI zeolite [11a,11c,11e,12]."

[3] "This paper is devoted to the investigation of the initial stages of propane transformations over Zn/H-MFI and Zn/silicalite catalysts using in situ 13C MAS NMR and IR spectroscopic techniques."

[4] "In summary, the results of 13C MAS NMR and IR spectroscopic in situ studies point to the formation of zinc propyl and ZnOH groups at the onset of propane reaction over Zn/H-MFI catalysts with high zinc content. These findings demonstrate that the initial step of propane conversion over Zn-containing zeolites is dissociative adsorption over Zn oxide species."

This mechanistic pathway explains the higher activity of Zn/H-MFI catalysts compared to H-MFI and the lower selectivity to aromatics compared to Ga/H-MFI. The ability to control product distribution through reaction conditions contributes to the industrial significance of these catalysts in alkane transformation processes.

金属基催化剂的组成、结构和反应条件显著影响烷烃转化的机理和效率。对于Zn/H-MFI催化剂：

1. 组成：高锌含量导致在丙烷反应开始时形成锌丙基和ZnOH基团。

2. 结构：沸石结构中锌氧化物物种和酸性位点的存在使丙烷活化和转化具有双功能机理。

3. 反应条件：
   - 压力：在反应物低分压下，氢气重组脱附和氢气演化被优先。在高压下，氢解路径被优先。
   - 温度：由于锌氧化物物种强度较弱，反应发生的温度比其他金属交换沸石更高。

该机理涉及丙烷在锌氧化物物种上的解离吸附，随后是丙烯演化和氢气的重组脱附。丙烯然后在酸性位点上发生寡聚，而氢气要么作为最终产物演化，要么参与丙烷的氢解生成乙烷和甲烷。

这种机理路径解释了Zn/H-MFI催化剂比H-MFI具有更高的活性，以及比Ga/H-MFI具有更低的芳烃选择性。通过反应条件控制产品分布的能力有助于这些催化剂在烷烃转化过程中的工业重要性。
