The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations. For Zn/H-MFI catalysts, the initial step in propane activation involves dissociative adsorption over zinc oxide sites, forming propyl zinc species and ZnOH groups. This mechanism differs from that of Ga/H-MFI catalysts.

Reaction conditions, particularly pressure, affect the reaction pathway. At low partial pressures, H2 recombinative desorption and hydrogen evolution are favored, while at high pressures, hydrogenolysis is preferred. This flexibility in reaction pathways contributes to the industrial significance of these catalysts.

The mechanistic differences between Zn/H-MFI and Ga/H-MFI catalysts result in varying catalytic performance. Zn/H-MFI catalysts show higher activity compared to H-MFI but lower selectivity to aromatics than Ga/H-MFI. This balance of activity and selectivity is crucial for optimizing industrial processes.

The study demonstrates how the choice of metal (Zn vs Ga) in zeolite catalysts can dramatically alter the reaction mechanism and product distribution. This understanding allows for tailoring catalysts to specific industrial needs, whether prioritizing overall activity or selectivity towards certain products.

金属基催化剂的成分、结构和反应条件显著影响烷烃转化的机理和效率。对于Zn/H-MFI催化剂，丙烷活化的初始步骤涉及在氧化锌位点上的解离吸附，形成丙基锌物种和ZnOH基团。这种机理与Ga/H-MFI催化剂不同。

反应条件，特别是压力，会影响反应途径。在低分压下，H2重组脱附和氢气演化是有利的，而在高压下，则倾向于氢解。这种反应途径的灵活性有助于这些催化剂的工业重要性。

Zn/H-MFI和Ga/H-MFI催化剂之间的机理差异导致催化性能不同。与H-MFI相比，Zn/H-MFI催化剂显示出更高的活性，但对芳烃的选择性低于Ga/H-MFI。这种活性和选择性的平衡对于优化工业过程至关重要。

该研究表明，在沸石催化剂中选择金属（Zn vs Ga）可以显著改变反应机理和产物分布。这种理解允许根据特定的工业需求定制催化剂，无论是优先考虑整体活性还是对某些产品的选择性。
