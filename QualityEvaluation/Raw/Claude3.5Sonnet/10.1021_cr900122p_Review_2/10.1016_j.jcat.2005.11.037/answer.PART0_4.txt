[1] "The development of in situ MAS NMR spectroscopic techniques [11] has allowed monitoring of the catalytic transformations directly on a catalyst surface during the course of the reaction."

[2] "Application of in situ 13C MAS NMR spectroscopy has enabled identification of the proposed detailed bifunctional mechanism of propane activation over Ga-modified acidic MFI zeolite [11a,11c,11e,12]."

[3] "This paper is devoted to the investigation of the initial stages of propane transformations over Zn/H-MFI and Zn/silicalite catalysts using in situ 13C MAS NMR and IR spectroscopic techniques."

[4] "In summary, the results of 13C MAS NMR and IR spectroscopic in situ studies point to the formation of zinc propyl and ZnOH groups at the onset of propane reaction over Zn/H-MFI catalysts with high zinc content. These findings demonstrate that the initial step of propane conversion over Zn-containing zeolites is dissociative adsorption over Zn oxide species."

[5] "The mechanism proposed for propane activation involves propane dissociation, followed by propene evolution and recombinative desorption of dihydrogen. Propene further oligomerizes over acidic sites, while dihydrogen either evolves as a final product or participates in propane hydrogenolysis into ethane and methane."

[6] "At low partial pressure of the reactants, H2 recombinative desorption and hydrogen evolution is favoured, whereas at high pressures, implied under NMR batch conditions, the hydrogenolysis route is preferred."

The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations. For Zn/H-MFI catalysts:

1. Composition: High zinc content leads to the formation of zinc propyl and ZnOH groups at the onset of propane reaction.

2. Structure: The presence of zinc oxide species and acidic sites in the zeolite structure enables a bifunctional mechanism for propane activation and conversion.

3. Reaction conditions: 
   - Pressure: At low partial pressure of reactants, H2 recombinative desorption and hydrogen evolution are favored. At high pressures, the hydrogenolysis route is preferred.
   - Temperature: The reaction occurs at higher temperatures compared to other metal-exchanged zeolites due to the weaker strength of zinc oxide species.

The mechanism involves propane dissociative adsorption over Zn oxide species, followed by propene evolution and recombinative desorption of dihydrogen. Propene then oligomerizes over acidic sites, while dihydrogen either evolves as a final product or participates in propane hydrogenolysis.

This mechanistic pathway explains the higher activity of Zn/H-MFI catalysts compared to H-MFI and the lower selectivity to aromatics compared to Ga/H-MFI. The ability to control product distribution through reaction conditions contributes to the industrial significance of these catalysts in alkane transformation processes.

金属基催化剂的组成、结构和反应条件显著影响烷烃转化的机理和效率。对于Zn/H-MFI催化剂：

1. 组成：高锌含量导致在丙烷反应开始时形成锌丙基和ZnOH基团。

2. 结构：沸石结构中锌氧化物物种和酸性位点的存在使丙烷活化和转化具有双功能机理。

3. 反应条件：
   - 压力：在反应物低分压下，氢气重组脱附和氢气演化被优先。在高压下，氢解路径被优先。
   - 温度：由于锌氧化物物种强度较弱，反应发生的温度比其他金属交换沸石更高。

该机理涉及丙烷在锌氧化物物种上的解离吸附，随后是丙烯演化和氢气的重组脱附。丙烯然后在酸性位点上发生寡聚，而氢气要么作为最终产物演化，要么参与丙烷的氢解生成乙烷和甲烷。

这种机理路径解释了Zn/H-MFI催化剂比H-MFI具有更高的活性，以及比Ga/H-MFI具有更低的芳烃选择性。通过反应条件控制产品分布的能力有助于这些催化剂在烷烃转化过程中的工业重要性。
