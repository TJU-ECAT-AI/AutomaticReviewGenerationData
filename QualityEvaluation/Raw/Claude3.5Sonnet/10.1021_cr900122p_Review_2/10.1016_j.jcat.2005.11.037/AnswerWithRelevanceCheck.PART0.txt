          [1] "The initial step in propane activation over Zn/H-MFI is dissociative adsorption over zinc oxide sites, leading to the formation of propyl zinc species and ZnOH groups."

[2] "At low partial pressure of the reactants, H2 recombinative desorption and hydrogen evolution is favoured, whereas at high pressures, implied under NMR batch conditions, the hydrogenolysis route is preferred."

[3] "The mechanism proposed for propane activation involves propane dissociation, followed by propene evolution and recombinative desorption of dihydrogen. Propene further oligomerizes over acidic sites, while dihydrogen either evolves as a final product or participates in propane hydrogenolysis into ethane and methane."

[4] "This mechanistic pathway explains the higher activity of Zn/H-MFI catalysts with respect to H-MFI and the lower selectivity to aromatics in comparison to Ga/H-MFI."

[5] "The development of in situ MAS NMR spectroscopic techniques [11] has allowed monitoring of the catalytic transformations directly on a catalyst surface during the course of the reaction."

[6] "Application of in situ 13C MAS NMR spectroscopy has enabled identification of the proposed detailed bifunctional mechanism of propane activation over Ga-modified acidic MFI zeolite [11a,11c,11e,12]."

          The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts, particularly Zn/H-MFI, significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations:

1. Composition: The presence of zinc oxide sites and acidic sites in the catalyst enables a bifunctional mechanism for propane activation and subsequent reactions. The high zinc content leads to the formation of zinc propyl and ZnOH groups at the onset of the propane reaction.

2. Structure: The MFI zeolite framework provides a suitable environment for both zinc oxide species and acidic sites, allowing for the dissociative adsorption of propane and further oligomerization of propene.

3. Reaction conditions: 
   - Pressure plays a crucial role in determining the reaction pathway. Low partial pressures favor hydrogen evolution, while high pressures promote the hydrogenolysis route.
   - Temperature affects the reaction, with Zn/H-MFI catalysts requiring higher temperatures compared to other metal-exchanged zeolites due to the weaker strength of zinc oxide species.

The mechanism involves initial dissociative adsorption of propane on zinc oxide sites, followed by propene evolution and recombinative desorption of dihydrogen. Propene then oligomerizes over acidic sites, while dihydrogen either evolves as a final product or participates in propane hydrogenolysis into ethane and methane.

This mechanistic pathway contributes to the industrial significance of Zn/H-MFI catalysts by providing higher activity compared to H-MFI catalysts. However, it also results in lower selectivity to aromatics compared to Ga/H-MFI catalysts due to enhanced ethane and methane formation through hydrogenolysis.

The development of in situ MAS NMR spectroscopic techniques has allowed for direct monitoring of catalytic transformations on the catalyst surface during reactions, enabling detailed identification of the bifunctional mechanism in metal-modified zeolites.

While the provided information doesn't specifically discuss oxidative dehydrogenation or supported vanadium oxides, the insights gained from the Zn/H-MFI system demonstrate how metal-based catalysts can be tailored to achieve desired alkane transformations. The balance between metal sites (for initial activation) and acid sites (for further transformations) appears to be a key factor in determining catalyst performance and product selectivity in industrial processes.

          金属基催化剂，特别是Zn/H-MFI的组成、结构和反应条件显著影响烷烃转化的机理和效率：

1. 组成：催化剂中氧化锌位点和酸性位点的存在使丙烷活化和后续反应能够通过双功能机理进行。高锌含量导致在丙烷反应开始时形成锌丙基和ZnOH基团。

2. 结构：MFI沸石骨架为氧化锌物种和酸性位点提供了适宜的环境，允许丙烷的解离吸附和丙烯的进一步寡聚。

3. 反应条件：
   - 压力在决定反应途径中起着关键作用。低分压有利于氢气演化，而高压则促进氢解路径。
   - 温度影响反应，由于锌氧化物物种强度较弱，Zn/H-MFI催化剂需要比其他金属交换沸石更高的温度。

该机理涉及丙烷在氧化锌位点上的初始解离吸附，随后是丙烯的演化和二氢的重组脱附。丙烯然后在酸性位点上寡聚，而二氢要么作为最终产物演化，要么参与丙烷的氢解生成乙烷和甲烷。

这种机理途径通过提供比H-MFI催化剂更高的活性，提高了Zn/H-MFI催化剂的工业重要性。然而，由于通过氢解反应增强了乙烷和甲烷的形成，它也导致了与Ga/H-MFI催化剂相比芳烃选择性的降低。

原位MAS NMR光谱技术的发展允许在反应过程中直接监测催化剂表面的催化转化，从而能够详细识别金属改性沸石中的双功能机理。

尽管提供的信息没有具体讨论氧化脱氢或负载的钒氧化物，但从Zn/H-MFI系统获得的见解表明，如何可以调整金属基催化剂以实现所需的烷烃转化。金属位点（用于初始活化）和酸性位点（用于进一步转化）之间的平衡似乎是决定催化剂性能和产品选择性的关键因素，这对工业过程有重要意义。
