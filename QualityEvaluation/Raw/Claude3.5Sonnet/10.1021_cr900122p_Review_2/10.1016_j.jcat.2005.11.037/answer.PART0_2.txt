[1] "The initial step in propane activation over Zn/H-MFI is dissociative adsorption over zinc oxide sites, leading to the formation of propyl zinc species and ZnOH groups."

[2] "At low partial pressure of the reactants, H2 recombinative desorption and hydrogen evolution is favoured, whereas at high pressures, implied under NMR batch conditions, the hydrogenolysis route is preferred."

[3] "The mechanism proposed for propane activation involves propane dissociation, followed by propene evolution and recombinative desorption of dihydrogen. Propene further oligomerizes over acidic sites, while dihydrogen either evolves as a final product or participates in propane hydrogenolysis into ethane and methane."

[4] "This mechanistic pathway explains the higher activity of Zn/H-MFI catalysts with respect to H-MFI and the lower selectivity to aromatics in comparison to Ga/H-MFI."

The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations. For Zn/H-MFI catalysts:

1. Composition: The presence of zinc oxide sites enables dissociative adsorption of propane, forming propyl zinc species and ZnOH groups. The acidic sites in the zeolite structure facilitate subsequent oligomerization of propene.

2. Structure: The MFI zeolite structure provides a framework for dispersing zinc species and creating acid sites, which work together in the catalytic process.

3. Reaction conditions: Pressure plays a crucial role in determining the reaction pathway. At low partial pressures, H2 recombinative desorption and hydrogen evolution are favored. At high pressures, the hydrogenolysis route is preferred, leading to ethane and methane formation.

These factors contribute to the industrial significance of Zn/H-MFI catalysts by:

1. Increasing activity compared to H-MFI catalysts in propane conversion.
2. Providing a different selectivity profile compared to Ga/H-MFI catalysts, with lower selectivity to aromatics.
3. Offering flexibility in product distribution based on reaction conditions, allowing for tuning of the process towards desired products.

The mechanistic insights gained from studying these catalysts can guide the development of more efficient and selective catalysts for industrial alkane transformation processes.

金属基催化剂的组成、结构和反应条件显著影响烷烃转化的机理和效率。对于Zn/H-MFI催化剂：

1. 组成：氧化锌位点的存在使得丙烷能够发生解离吸附，形成丙基锌物种和ZnOH基团。沸石结构中的酸性位点促进随后的丙烯寡聚反应。

2. 结构：MFI沸石结构为锌物种的分散和酸性位点的创建提供了框架，这些位点在催化过程中协同工作。

3. 反应条件：压力在决定反应路径中起着关键作用。在低分压下，氢气重组脱附和氢气演化是优先的。在高压下，氢解路径被优先选择，导致乙烷和甲烷的形成。

这些因素对Zn/H-MFI催化剂的工业重要性贡献如下：

1. 与H-MFI催化剂相比，提高了丙烷转化的活性。
2. 与Ga/H-MFI催化剂相比，提供了不同的选择性分布，对芳烃的选择性较低。
3. 基于反应条件提供了产品分布的灵活性，允许根据所需产品调整过程。

从研究这些催化剂获得的机理见解可以指导开发更高效和选择性的工业烷烃转化过程催化剂。
