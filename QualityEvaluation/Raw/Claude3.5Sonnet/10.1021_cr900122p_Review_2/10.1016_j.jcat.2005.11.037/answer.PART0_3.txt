[1] "The initial step in propane activation over Zn/H-MFI is dissociative adsorption over zinc oxide sites, leading to the formation of propyl zinc species and ZnOH groups."

[2] "At low partial pressure of the reactants, H2 recombinative desorption and hydrogen evolution is favoured, whereas at high pressures, implied under NMR batch conditions, the hydrogenolysis route is preferred."

[3] "The mechanism proposed for propane activation involves propane dissociation, followed by propene evolution and recombinative desorption of dihydrogen. Propene further oligomerizes over acidic sites, while dihydrogen either evolves as a final product or participates in propane hydrogenolysis into ethane and methane."

[4] "This mechanistic pathway explains the higher activity of Zn/H-MFI catalysts with respect to H-MFI and the lower selectivity to aromatics in comparison to Ga/H-MFI."

The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations. For Zn/H-MFI catalysts:

1. Composition: The presence of zinc oxide sites and acidic sites in the catalyst enables a two-step mechanism for propane activation and transformation.

2. Structure: The zeolite structure provides both zinc oxide sites for initial propane dissociation and acidic sites for subsequent oligomerization of propene.

3. Reaction conditions: Pressure plays a crucial role in determining the reaction pathway. Low partial pressures favor hydrogen evolution, while high pressures promote hydrogenolysis.

This mechanism results in higher activity compared to H-MFI catalysts but lower selectivity to aromatics than Ga/H-MFI catalysts. The industrial significance of these catalysts stems from their ability to activate propane at relatively low temperatures and their tunable selectivity based on reaction conditions.

While the literature doesn't specifically discuss oxidative dehydrogenation or supported vanadium oxides, the insights gained from the Zn/H-MFI system demonstrate how metal-based catalysts can be tailored to achieve desired alkane transformations. The balance between metal sites (for initial activation) and acid sites (for further transformations) appears to be a key factor in determining catalyst performance and product selectivity.

金属基催化剂的组成、结构和反应条件显著影响烷烃转化的机理和效率。对于Zn/H-MFI催化剂：

1. 组成：催化剂中氧化锌位点和酸性位点的存在使丙烷活化和转化的两步机理成为可能。

2. 结构：沸石结构提供了初始丙烷解离的氧化锌位点和随后丙烯低聚的酸性位点。

3. 反应条件：压力在决定反应途径中起着关键作用。低分压有利于氢气演化，而高压促进氢解。

这种机理导致与H-MFI催化剂相比活性更高，但与Ga/H-MFI催化剂相比芳烃选择性较低。这些催化剂的工业意义在于它们能够在相对较低的温度下活化丙烷，并且基于反应条件可以调节选择性。

虽然文献没有具体讨论氧化脱氢或负载的钒氧化物，但从Zn/H-MFI系统获得的见解表明，如何可以调整金属基催化剂以实现所需的烷烃转化。金属位点（用于初始活化）和酸性位点（用于进一步转化）之间的平衡似乎是决定催化剂性能和产品选择性的关键因素。
