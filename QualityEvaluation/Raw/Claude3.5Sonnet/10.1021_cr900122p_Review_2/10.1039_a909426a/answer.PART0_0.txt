[1] "Zn-doped catalysts are well studied and one of them is used in the commercial Cyclar process."

[2] "Zinc can be introduced to a zeolite by aqueous or solid ion exchange techniques. Action of the ZnCl2 vapour on H-ZSM5 also leads to a Zn-exchanged zeolite."

[3] "The catalytic activity towards alkane aromatisation is due mainly to the ionic Zn2+ species."

[4] "The first step of ethane and propane aromatisation in a Zn-doped zeolite catalyst is the dehydrogenation of these alkanes to the corresponding alkenes."

[5] "The results obtained indicate that the reaction proceeds via a mechanism starting from the alkyl rupture of the ethane C–H bond (C2H5–•H–•), and the zinc cation acts as an acceptor of the alkyl group."

[6] "The catalytic cycle for the alkyl activation consists of three elementary steps: (i) rupture of ethane C–H bond on the Zn–O–• pair; (ii) formation of ethene from the alkyl group bound to Zn; and (iii) formation of dihydrogen from the Brønsted proton and hydrogen bound to Zn."

The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations. For Zn-exchanged zeolites:

Composition: Zn2+ ions are introduced into zeolites through ion exchange techniques, including aqueous, solid, or vapor methods. The active species for alkane aromatization are primarily ionic Zn2+ species.

Structure: Zn2+ ions coordinate with zeolite oxygens, replacing protons in the zeolite framework. This creates Zn-O-• pairs that act as active sites for alkane activation.

Reaction mechanism: The dehydrogenation of alkanes (e.g., ethane, propane) is the first step in aromatization. The reaction proceeds through an alkyl activation route, where the Zn2+ ion acts as an acceptor for the alkyl group. The catalytic cycle involves three steps: C-H bond rupture, alkene formation, and dihydrogen formation.

Efficiency: The alkyl activation route has lower activation barriers compared to the alternative carbenium route, making it more efficient.

Industrial significance: Zn-doped catalysts are used in commercial processes like the Cyclar process, highlighting their importance in industry. Their ability to catalyze both dehydrogenation and further dehydrocyclooligomerization contributes to their effectiveness in alkane aromatization.

These factors collectively contribute to the catalytic performance of Zn-exchanged zeolites in alkane transformations, making them industrially significant for processes such as the conversion of light hydrocarbons to aromatics.

金属基催化剂的组成、结构和反应条件显著影响烷烃转化的机理和效率。对于锌交换沸石：

组成：通过离子交换技术将Zn2+离子引入沸石，包括水相、固相或气相方法。烷烃芳构化的活性物种主要是离子态的Zn2+。

结构：Zn2+离子与沸石氧配位，取代沸石骨架中的质子。这创造了作为烷烃活化活性位点的Zn-O-•对。

反应机理：烷烃（如乙烷、丙烷）的脱氢是芳构化的第一步。反应通过烷基活化路径进行，其中Zn2+离子作为烷基基团的接受者。催化循环包括三个步骤：C-H键断裂、烯烃形成和氢气形成。

效率：与替代的碳正离子路径相比，烷基活化路径具有较低的活化能垒，因此效率更高。

工业重要性：锌掺杂催化剂用于商业过程，如Cyclar工艺，突显了它们在工业中的重要性。它们能够同时催化脱氢和进一步的脱氢环化寡聚反应，这有助于它们在烷烃芳构化中的有效性。

这些因素共同影响锌交换沸石在烷烃转化中的催化性能，使它们在轻质烃转化为芳烃等工业过程中具有重要意义。
