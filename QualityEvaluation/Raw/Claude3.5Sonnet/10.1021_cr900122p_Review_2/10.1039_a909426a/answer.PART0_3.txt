[1] "The selectivity of zeolite catalysts towards aromatisation of small alkanes can be greatly increased by incorporation of zinc or gallium ions."

[2] "Zinc can be introduced to a zeolite by aqueous or solid ion exchange techniques. Action of the ZnCl2 vapour on H-ZSM5 also leads to a Zn-exchanged zeolite."

[3] "The first step of ethane and propane aromatisation in a Zn-doped zeolite catalyst is the dehydrogenation of these alkanes to the corresponding alkenes. The alkenes then undergo dehydrocyclooligomerisation."

[4] "The results obtained indicate that the reaction proceeds via a mechanism starting from the alkyl rupture of the ethane CH bond (C2H5−H−), and the zinc cation acts as an acceptor of the alkyl group."

[5] "The catalytic cycle for the alkyl activation consists of three elementary steps: (i) rupture of ethane CH bond on the Zn−O− pair; (ii) formation of ethene from the alkyl group bound to Zn; and (iii) formation of dihydrogen from the Brønsted proton and hydrogen bound to Zn."

The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts, specifically zinc-exchanged zeolites, significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations. 

Zinc incorporation into zeolites greatly increases their selectivity towards aromatization of small alkanes. The zinc can be introduced through aqueous or solid ion exchange techniques, or by exposing H-ZSM5 to ZnCl2 vapor.

In Zn-doped zeolite catalysts, the first step of ethane and propane aromatization is dehydrogenation to the corresponding alkenes, followed by dehydrocyclooligomerisation. The mechanism proceeds via alkyl rupture of the C-H bond, with the zinc cation acting as an acceptor for the alkyl group.

The catalytic cycle for alkyl activation involves three main steps:
1. Rupture of the ethane C-H bond on the Zn-O pair
2. Formation of ethene from the Zn-bound alkyl group
3. Formation of dihydrogen from the Brønsted proton and Zn-bound hydrogen

These factors contribute to the industrial significance of Zn-exchanged zeolites in alkane transformation processes, particularly in dehydrogenation and aromatization reactions. The ability to fine-tune catalyst composition and structure allows for optimized reaction pathways and improved product selectivity.

金属基催化剂的组成、结构和反应条件，特别是锌交换沸石，显著影响烷烃转化的机理和效率。

将锌引入沸石能大大提高其对小分子烷烃芳构化的选择性。锌可以通过水相或固相离子交换技术引入，或通过将H-ZSM5暴露于ZnCl2蒸气中引入。

在掺锌的沸石催化剂中，乙烷和丙烷芳构化的第一步是脱氢生成相应的烯烃，随后进行脱氢环化寡聚。该机理通过C-H键的烷基断裂进行，锌阳离子作为烷基基团的接受体。

烷基活化的催化循环包括三个主要步骤：
1. 在Zn-O对上断裂乙烷的C-H键
2. 从与Zn结合的烷基基团形成乙烯
3. 从Brønsted质子和与Zn结合的氢形成氢气

这些因素促成了锌交换沸石在烷烃转化过程中的工业重要性，特别是在脱氢和芳构化反应中。能够精细调整催化剂组成和结构，允许优化反应途径并提高产品选择性。
