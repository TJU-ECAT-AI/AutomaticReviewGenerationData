A theoretical study of the mechanism of ethane dehydrogenation catalysed by Zn-doped zeolites was
undertaken. The catalyst was modelled by the ring cluster
coordinated with the Zn2 ion.
[Al2Si2O4H8]2
The results obtained indicate that the reaction proceeds via a mechanism starting from the alkyl rupture of
the ethane CH bond
and the zinc cation acts as an acceptor of the alkyl group. The catalytic
(C2H5dHd),
cycle for the alkyl activation consists of three elementary steps: (i) rupture of ethane CH bond on the
ZndOd pair; (ii) formation of ethene from the alkyl group bound to Zn; and (iii) formation of dihydrogen
from the
proton and hydrogen bound to Zn. The computed activation energies for these three steps
Brnsted
are 18.4, 53.4 and 20.5 kcal mol1, respectively. The alternative mechanism starting from the carbenium
activation
with the zinc cation abstracting the hydride ion, is unfavourable because of the high
(C2H5dHd),
activation barrier for the rst step (67.6 kcal mol1).

Introduction
The selectivity of zeolite catalysts towards aromatisation of
small alkanes can be greatly increased by incorporation of
zinc or gallium ions.1,2 Ga-doped catalysts are well studied
and one of them is used in the commercial Cyclar process.3
However, use of a Zn modier instead of Ga might be prefer-
ential from the environmental point of view. A number of
studies have addressed the location of metal cations in and
catalytic properties of the Zn-containing zeolites.1,2,4h19 A
commercial aromatisation process for light hydrocarbons with
Zn-doped H-ZSM5 as a catalyst was proposed recently.20
Zinc can be introduced to a zeolite by aqueous or solid ion
exchange techniques. Action of the
vapour on H-ZSM5
ZnCl2
also leads to a Zn-exchanged zeolite.18 K-edge X-ray adsorp-
tion studies by Biscardi et al.4 indicated that aqueous ion
exchange leads to isolated Zn2 cations in H-ZSM5. The
metal cations enter zeolite channels4h6 and substitute two
protons per Zn2. In contrast, Zn/H-ZSM5 samples synthe-
sised by impregnation contain both Zn2 cations and external
ZnO crystallites.4 The Zn2 ions coordinate to four or six
zeolite oxygens7,8 and remain unreduced under the alkane
conversion conditions,4 while the ZnO deposits are gradually
reduced to the Zn vapour. The catalytic activity towards
alkane aromatisation is due mainly to the ionic Zn2
species.4,9
The rst step of ethane10h13 and propane14,15 aroma-
tisation in a Zn-doped zeolite catalyst is the dehydrogenation
of these alkanes to the corresponding alkenes. The alkenes
then
undergo
dehydrocyclooligomerisation.
Mechanistic
studies14 indicated that Zn (and also Ga) catalyses both dehy-
drogenation of alkane and further dehydrocyclooligomerisa-
tion, probably due to an increased rate of the H adatom
recombination to
molecules.16h18

reaction mechanisms in Ga-exchanged zeolites have already
been performed.21h24 However, for Zn-exchanged zeolites we
found no previous quantum chemical publications.
The aim of this study was to compute intermediates and
transition states involved in the catalytic cycle for the dehy-
drogenation of ethane to ethene in a zinc-exchanged zeolite.
Ethane was chosen as the smallest alkane that can yield an
alkene via monomolecular dehydrogenation.

Models and details of calculations
The Zn-containing zeolite catalytic site was modelled using
the cluster approach, the currently most developed and fre-
quently used technique for studying reactions on the surface
of solids.25h29 The
ring cluster (Fig. 1) was

enough to limit the computational eorts. Such a cluster was
previously used in studies of zeolite structural properties,31h35
acid strength31h33 and palladium cations in zeolites.36,37 An
increase in the cluster size is not expected to change the results
of the modelling study signicantly. Indeed, in a recent study

of a related reaction, hydrogen adsorptiondesorption in Ga
zeolites,23 only a moderate inuence of the cluster size
(ranging from 1 to 5 T atoms) on the results was observed. To
saturate the dangling bonds of the cluster, we used terminal
hydrogens, which is preferred over the use of a charged
model.26,38
Two basis sets were used in the computations. The smaller
set (denoted BS1) was composed of the WachtersHay basis
set39 on Zn and the Pople 631G* set on all other atoms, and
was employed for the geometry optimisation. (The 631G*
basis set for Zn was dened40 later than the calculations were
performed.) The larger basis set (denoted BS2) was produced
from BS1 by adding polarisation functions on hydrogens and
diuse functions on all atoms as dened in GAUSSIAN 94,
and used for the single-point calculations in the optimised
geometries.
Geometries of the species involved were fully optimised
using the hybrid non-local density functional B3LYP41h43
method, which is known to yield good geometry parameters
at a moderate computational cost. The gradient technique44
was employed with the tight keyword for convergence cri-

To rene the reaction heats and activation energies, higher

B3LYP single point calculations with the BS2 basis set were

calculations were included in the computed reaction heats and

HartreeFock (HF)45 geometry optimisation with BS1, fol-
lowed by MP2 single point calculations with BS2.
The calculations were carried out with the GAUSSIAN 94

Results and discussion
The results of calculations provided two distinct routes of
ethane activation on the zeolite-coordinated Zn cations. The
rst route starts with the alkyl activation of a CH bond
(RdHd), whereas the second route starts with carbenium
activation (RdHd).
3.1.
Alkyl activation of ethane
The reaction route found for alkyl activation of ethane on
the zeolite-coordinated zinc cation is shown in Fig. 2 and con-
sists of three elementary steps. In the rst step, one of the CH
bonds of ethane breaks heterolytically (CdHd) on the
ZndOd Lewis pair. The direction of CH bond polarisa-
tion is apparent from the values of charges in the transition
states II, ]0.40e on the H atom and [0.46e on the C2H5

group. The resulting negative alkyl group binds to the zinc
cation, giving the adsorbed
cation of structure

III. The remaining proton of ethane binds to one of the zeolite
oxygens. The rst step is almost thermoneutral ([0.2 kcal
mol1 at the MP2/BS2/B3LYP/BS1 level, Table 1) and its
activation energy is 18.4 kcal mol1.
In the second step, stretching of the CdZnd bond of
structure III enhances polarisation of this bond and therefore
increases the Lewis acid strength of the Zn cation. Its charge
increases from ]1.44e in III to ]1.63e in the transition struc-
ture IV. The Zn cation polarises the b-CH bond of the ethyl
group, causing a negative charge [0.43e on hydrogen and a
positive charge ]0.12e on the
group. The CH bond

in IV. The complete

rupture of the ZnC and CH bonds of IV gives the ethene
molecule and the adsorbed [ZnH] cation of structure V.
This step is endoergic (26.9 kcal mol1) and has an activation
energy of 53.4 kcal mol1. This is the highest activation
barrier within the alkyl route.
The third step consists in the recombination of the Brnsted
proton (charge ]0.56e) bound to the zeolite oxygen with the
hydride hydrogen atom (charge [0.48e) bound to Zn.

step is slightly endoergic (]5.4 kcal mol1) and has an activa-
tion barrier of 20.5 kcal mol1. The original catalytic species,
the zeolite-coordinated zinc cation I, is regenerated in this
step.
The data in Table 1 provide a comparison of the energy
parameters obtained at the three dierent levels of calcu-
lations. One can see that the MP2/BS2//B3LYP/BS1 and
MP2/BS2//HF/BS1 parameters are very close (the maximum
deviation is 3.2 kcal mol1 for the activation energy of the
second step). The B3LYP/BS2//B3LYP/BS1 reaction heats for
the second and third steps dier more signicantly from the
MP2/BS2//B3LYP/BS1 values. The B3LYP method favours
the adsorbed [ZnH] cation (structure V in Fig. 2), predict-
ing lower endothermicity (by ca. 7 kcal mol1) for its forma-
tion (second step) and higher endothermicity (by ca. 5 kcal
mol1) for its decomposition (third step). However, the activa-
tion energies computed at these two levels are close (within 3.5
kcal mol1). Hence there is reasonable agreement between the
results obtained at dierent levels of calculations.
The computed heats of the dehydrogenation reaction
are within 30.832.1 kcal mol1 (Table
C2H6 ] C2H4 ] H2
1). This is in good agreement with the experimental value of
30.9 kcal mol1 derived from the heats of formation at 0 K
[16.4;
14.5;
0 kcal mol1).49 We did not

dehydrogenation of ethane in Zn zeolites. However, the com-
puted and experimental activation energies for the hydrogen

3.2.
Carbenium activation of ethane
The reaction route found for carbenium activation of
ethane on the zeolite-coordinated zinc cation is shown in Fig.
3 and consists of two elementary steps. In the rst step, one of
the CH bonds of ethane breaks heterolytically on the Znd
Od Lewis pair. In contrast to the above-considered alkyl
activation case, now the polarisation of this bond is CdHd,
as follows from the values of charges on the H atom ([0.42e)
and the
group (]0.56e) in the transition state VII. The
C2H5
resulting hydride anion binds to the Zn atom, whereas the
ethyl cation binds to the zeolite oxygen (structure VIII). This
step is endoergic (10.2 kcal mol1 at the MP2/BS2//B3LYP/

BS1 level). The calculated activation energy for the step is 67.6
kcal mol1, which is much higher (ca. 49 kcal mol1) than
that for the rst step of alkyl activation. This may be due to
the higher electronegativity of carbon with respect to hydro-
gen, together with the low stability of the primary ethyl cation
formed upon the hydride abstraction from ethane.
In the second step, the CdOd bond of structure VIII
undergoes elongation (from 1.475
in VIII to 2.376
in the
A
A
transition structure IX). Simultaneously the positive b-
hydrogen of the ethyl group approaches the hydride hydro-
gen bound to Zn. The HH distance in IX is 1.116
instead
A
 ,
of 6.128
in VIII. The second step results in the formation of
A
dihydrogen and ethene and regeneration of the original cata-
lytic species I. This step is endoergic by 21.8 kcal mol1 and
its activation energy is 44.1 kcal mol1.
Comparison of the two considered routes (Fig. 4) of ethane
activation
indicates
that
the
highest
barrier
within
the
carbenium route (for its rst step) is signicantly greater
than the highest barrier within the alkyl route (for its
second step). The dierence is ca. 14, 9 and 14 kcal mol1 as
computed at the MP2/BS2//HF/BS1, B3LYP/BS2//B3LYP/
BS1 and MP2/BS2//B3LYP/BS1 levels, respectively (Table 1
and 2). Along with the lower activation energy, the second
step
of
the
alkyl
route
should
have
a
greater
pre-
exponential factor than the rst step of the carbenium
route, since the former step is monomolecular and the latter is
bimolecular. This implies that the alkyl route plays the
major role in the ethane dehydrogenation process.
3.3.
Discussion
The results of calculations indicate that the likely reaction
route for ethane activation in Zn-exchanged zeolites is the
alkyl route. This route consists of three elementary steps:
cleavage of the ethane CH bond on the ZndOd pair, for-
mation of ethene from the alkyl group bound to Zn and for-
mation of dihydrogen from two surface hydrogens bound to
Zn and O.
Participation of the zeolite oxygen together with the metal
atom in activation of alkane is in agreement with the mecha-
nism proposed by Price et al.50 for Ga-exchanged zeolites.

However, the direction of the alkane CH bond polarisation
during activation predicted from the results of calculations is
dierent from that assumed in the literature. Indeed, a number
of authors1,16h18 suggested that the metal atom acts as a
hydride ion acceptor, and the bond polarisation is CdHd.
In contrast, our calculations indicate that zinc (and also
gallium24) preferentially acts as an alkyl anion acceptor and
therefore the ethane bond polarisation is CdHd. Note that
our result is in line with the higher electronegativity of carbon
with respect to hydrogen, and also with the low stability of the
primary ethyl carbenium ion that should be formed in the
case of hydride abstraction.
According to the results of calculations, formation of ethene
occurs due to the reaction [ZnC2H5] ] C2H4 ] [ZnH].
Although not explicitly considered so far for this system, we
found that a similar type of reaction was proposed to explain
the activity of the
catalyst for the CH and CC
ZrH/SiO2
bond cleavage in alkanes.51 A silica-supported zirconium
hydride catalyst was prepared51 that converts alkanes larger
than ethane (in the presence of hydrogen) into a mixture of
methane and ethane at room temperature. The reaction
mechanism oered51 is based on the heterolytic cleavage of
the ZrC bond accompanied by b-hydrogen or b-methyl
transfer to zirconium.
Formation of dihydrogen from the surface hydrogens
bound to Zn and O (the third step of our calculated reaction
route) is in line with the metal porthole mechanism pro-
posed by Iglesia et al.16h18 The computed activation energies
for hydrogen desorption (20.5 kcal mol1) and adsorption
(15.1 kcal mol1) are close to the measured value for the
isotope exchange of
with Zn/H-ZSM-5 (14.8 kcal mol1).4
D2
Hydrogen desorption is not the highest barrier step in our
computed reaction route, while some experimental data18
suggest that this step is the rate-determining step. However, in
the overall kinetics, hydrogen recombination may well be con-
sidered rate-limiting, since it is the co-product of alkene for-
mation, which has a higher barrier.
The present computational results for ethane activation in
Zn-doped zeolites resemble those obtained in our previous
work24 on Ga-doped zeolites. The alkyl route is found to
be preferred over the carbenium route in both cases. More-
over, the three elementary steps involved in the proposed
alkyl routes for both the Zn- and Ga-doped catalysts are
similar. The rst step, i.e., the cleavage of the ethane CH
bond, is exactly the same in both cases. The main dierence
between the reaction mechanisms in the two catalysts is the
order of the
formation and
formation. Formation of
C2H4
H2
ethene is the second step and formation of dihydrogen is the
third step in the case of Zn, whereas in the case of Ga the
sequence of these reactions is found to be opposite.
4.
Conclusion
Quantum-chemical calculations on the mechanism of ethane
dehydrogenation catalysed by Zn-doped zeolites have been
undertaken. Two reaction mechanisms were considered, one
starting from the alkyl rupture of the ethane CH bond
and the other starting from the carbenium
(C2H5dHd),
rupture of this bond

cate that the alkyl route is more likely to occur as it
involves lower activation barriers than the carbenium route.
Hence the Zn2 ion acts as an ethyl group acceptor during
ethane activation, rather than as a hydride ion acceptor.
The catalytic cycle found for ethane transformation to
ethene and dihydrogen in the Zn-doped zeolites consists of
three elementary steps: (i) rupture of the ethane CH bond
and binding of the ethyl group to zinc and of the proton to
the zeolite oxygen; (ii) rupture of the ethane CN bond and
binding of the ethyl group to zinc and of the proton to the
zeolite oxygen; (iii) formation of ethene from the ethyl group
bound to Zn; (iv) formation of dihydrogen from the Brnsted
proton and hydrogen bound to Zn.
The activation energies of the three elementary steps
involved in the alkyl route computed at the MP2/BS2/
B3LYP/BS1 level (the highest in this work) are 18.4, 53.4 and
20.5 kcal mol1, respectively. Calculations were also per-
formed at two other levels (MP2/BS2/HF/BS1 and B3LYP/
BS2/B3LYP/BS1), and all three methods gave very similar
potential energy proles.
