[1] "Zn-doped catalysts are well studied and one of them is used in the commercial Cyclar process."

[2] "The catalytic activity towards alkane aromatisation is due mainly to the ionic Zn2+ species."

[3] "The first step of ethane10−13 and propane14,15 aromatisation in a Zn-doped zeolite catalyst is the dehydrogenation of these alkanes to the corresponding alkenes."

[4] "The results obtained indicate that the reaction proceeds via a mechanism starting from the alkyl rupture of the ethane C−H bond (C2H5−⊕H−⊖), and the zinc cation acts as an acceptor of the alkyl group."

[5] "The catalytic cycle for the alkyl activation consists of three elementary steps: (i) rupture of ethane C−H bond on the Zn−⊕O−⊖ pair; (ii) formation of ethene from the alkyl group bound to Zn; and (iii) formation of dihydrogen from the Brønsted proton and hydrogen bound to Zn."

The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts, particularly Zn-exchanged zeolites, significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations in processes such as dehydrogenation and aromatization.

For Zn-doped zeolites, the catalytically active species are primarily ionic Zn2+ cations. These catalysts are effective for alkane aromatization, with the first step being dehydrogenation of alkanes to alkenes.

The mechanism for ethane activation in Zn-exchanged zeolites involves three key steps:

1. Rupture of the ethane C-H bond on the Zn-O pair, with zinc acting as an acceptor for the alkyl group.
2. Formation of ethene from the alkyl group bound to Zn.
3. Formation of dihydrogen from the Brønsted proton and hydrogen bound to Zn.

This alkyl activation route is found to be more favorable than the carbenium activation route, with lower activation barriers.

The industrial significance of these catalysts is demonstrated by their use in commercial processes such as the Cyclar process. The ability of Zn-doped zeolites to catalyze both dehydrogenation and subsequent aromatization steps contributes to their importance in industrial applications for converting light hydrocarbons into more valuable aromatic products.

金属基催化剂的组成、结构和反应条件，尤其是锌交换沸石，对烷烃转化过程中的机理和效率有显著影响，特别是在脱氢和芳构化等过程中。

对于锌掺杂的沸石，催化活性主要来自离子态的Zn2+阳离子。这些催化剂对烷烃芳构化非常有效，第一步是将烷烃脱氢成烯烃。

在锌交换沸石中，乙烷活化的机理包括三个关键步骤：

1. 在Zn-O对上断裂乙烷的C-H键，锌作为烷基基团的受体。
2. 从与Zn结合的烷基基团形成乙烯。
3. 从Brønsted质子和与Zn结合的氢形成二氢分子。

这种烷基活化路径被发现比碳正离子活化路径更有利，具有更低的活化能垒。

这些催化剂的工业重要性体现在它们被用于商业过程，如Cyclar过程。锌掺杂沸石能够同时催化脱氢和随后的芳构化步骤，这使得它们在将轻质烃转化为更有价值的芳香族产品的工业应用中具有重要性。
