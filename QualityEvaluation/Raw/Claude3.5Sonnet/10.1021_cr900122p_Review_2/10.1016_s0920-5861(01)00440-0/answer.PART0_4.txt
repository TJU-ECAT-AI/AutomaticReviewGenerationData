The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations. For methane dehydrocondensation to benzene and naphthalene, transition metal supported zeolite catalysts play a crucial role. The choice of metal and zeolite support affects catalyst activity, selectivity, and stability.

Mo/HZSM-5 is widely recognized as an effective catalyst for this reaction. The activity of transition metals follows the order Mo > W > Fe > V > Cr. The zeolite support structure is also important, with H-type silica-alumina zeolites like ZSM-5, ZSM-8, and ZSM-11 showing good performance.

Factors contributing to industrial significance include the ability to improve catalyst activity, selectivity, and stability through careful selection of metal components and zeolite supports. Additionally, the potential for direct conversion of methane to more valuable aromatic compounds makes this process industrially attractive, especially given the abundance of natural gas resources.
