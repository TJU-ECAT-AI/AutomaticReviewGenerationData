[1] "Wang et al. [11] reported that methane could be transformed to benzene in a flow mode reactor on transition metal ions supported HZSM-5 catalysts under non-oxidative condition."

[2] "It is generally accepted that the Mo/HZSM-5 is one of the good catalysts as reported by groups of Xu and co-workers [13,14], Chen et al. [15], Solymosi et al. [1619], Wang et al. [20,21], and Liu et al. [22,23]."

[3] "Weckhuysen et al. [26] studied the effect of transition metal ions, the preparation and treatment method. They found that the activity is in the following sequence: Mo > W > Fe > V > Cr."

[4] "Zhang et al. studied the methane aromatization over Mo-based catalysts supported on different types of zeolites [32]. It was found that H-type silicaalumina zeolites, such as ZSM-5, ZSM-8, ZSM-11 and β zeolite, were effective supports for Mo-based catalysts"

The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations. For methane dehydrocondensation to benzene, transition metal ions supported on HZSM-5 zeolites, particularly Mo/HZSM-5, have shown good catalytic performance. The activity of different transition metals follows the order Mo > W > Fe > V > Cr. The zeolite support plays a crucial role, with H-type silica-alumina zeolites like ZSM-5, ZSM-8, ZSM-11, and β zeolite being effective supports for Mo-based catalysts. These factors contribute to the industrial significance of these catalysts by enabling the direct conversion of methane to higher-value aromatic compounds under non-oxidative conditions, which is important for utilizing natural gas reserves as crude oil reserves decline.

金属基催化剂的组成、结构和反应条件显著影响烷烃转化的机理和效率。对于甲烷脱氢缩合生成苯的反应，过渡金属离子负载在HZSM-5分子筛上的催化剂，特别是Mo/HZSM-5，表现出良好的催化性能。不同过渡金属的活性顺序为Mo > W > Fe > V > Cr。分子筛载体起着至关重要的作用，H型硅铝分子筛如ZSM-5、ZSM-8、ZSM-11和β分子筛是Mo基催化剂的有效载体。这些因素通过在非氧化条件下实现甲烷直接转化为高价值芳烃化合物，为这些催化剂的工业重要性做出了贡献，这对于在原油储量下降的情况下利用天然气储量非常重要。
