[1] "Wang et al. [11] reported that methane could be transformed to benzene in a flow mode reactor on transition metal ions supported HZSM-5 catalysts under non-oxidative condition."

[2] "It is generally accepted that the Mo/HZSM-5 is one of the good catalysts as reported by groups of Xu and co-workers [13,14], Chen et al. [15], Solymosi et al. [1619], Wang et al. [20,21], and Liu et al. [22,23]."

[3] "Weckhuysen et al. [26] studied the effect of transition metal ions, the preparation and treatment method. They found that the activity is in the following sequence: Mo > W > Fe > V > Cr."

[4] "Zhang et al. studied the methane aromatization over Mo-based catalysts supported on different types of zeolites [32]. It was found that H-type silicaalumina zeolites, such as ZSM-5, ZSM-8, ZSM-11 and -zeolite, were effective supports"

The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations. For methane dehydrocondensation, transition metal ions supported on zeolites, particularly HZSM-5, have shown good catalytic performance. The activity of different metals follows the order Mo > W > Fe > V > Cr. The zeolite support plays a crucial role, with H-type silica-alumina zeolites like ZSM-5, ZSM-8, ZSM-11, and β-zeolite being effective. Reaction conditions such as temperature and flow rate also affect the catalytic process. The industrial significance of these catalysts lies in their ability to directly convert methane to valuable aromatic compounds like benzene under non-oxidative conditions, which is a challenging and important process for utilizing natural gas resources.

金属基催化剂的组成、结构和反应条件显著影响烷烃转化的机理和效率。对于甲烷脱氢缩合反应，负载在沸石上的过渡金属离子，特别是HZSM-5，表现出良好的催化性能。不同金属的活性顺序为Mo > W > Fe > V > Cr。沸石载体起着关键作用，H型硅铝沸石如ZSM-5、ZSM-8、ZSM-11和β-沸石是有效的载体。温度和流速等反应条件也影响催化过程。这些催化剂的工业意义在于它们能够在非氧化条件下直接将甲烷转化为苯等有价值的芳香族化合物，这是利用天然气资源的一个具有挑战性和重要性的过程。
