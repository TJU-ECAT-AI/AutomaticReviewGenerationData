          [1] "Coaromatization of methane and light hydrocarbons (paraffins and olefins) at 700800K is one of the alternative methods for the conversion of methane."

[2] "It has been reported recently that the conversion of methane during coaromatization with higher alkanes or alkenes (C2C6) at 670870K in the presence of bifunctional catalysts (mainly, high-silica ZSM-5 or ZSM-11 zeolites, modified with gallium or zinc) may reach 2040%."

[3] "Our data show that the activation of methane on Zn/H-BEA indeed occurs at 523K through the formation of a surface methoxy species (a stabilized methyl cation) (δ=58ppm8 in the 13C CP/MAS NMR spectrum, Figure3a). The initial activation of methane also gives a Zn-CH3 species (δ=21ppm9)."

[4] "The dissociation of methane on ZnO species may be facilitated by neighboring acidic sites of the zeolite."

[5] "The role of the higher hydrocarbon consists of producing aromatic compounds, which further serve as a trap for the methoxy species formed from methane on the Zn sites (Scheme1a)."

[6] "Thus, the main pathway for the conversion of methane into aromatic compounds during the course of the methane and propane co-conversion represents the alkylation of propane-originating aromatic molecules by 13CH4."

          The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts, particularly Zn-modified high-silica zeolites, significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations:

1. Composition: Zn-modified high-silica zeolites (e.g., Zn/H-BEA, ZSM-5, ZSM-11) are used as catalysts. The presence of zinc is crucial for methane activation and conversion.

2. Structure: The zeolite structure provides a framework for the metal sites. Nanosized ZnO clusters are located inside the channels of the Zn/H-BEA zeolite. The combination of ZnO species and neighboring acidic sites of the zeolite facilitates methane dissociation.

3. Reaction conditions: Temperature plays a critical role. Coaromatization of methane and light hydrocarbons occurs at 700-800K, while methane activation on Zn/H-BEA begins at 523K. Full conversion is observed at 823K.

4. Mechanism: The main pathway for methane conversion involves the formation of surface methoxy species (stabilized methyl cation) on ZnO sites, followed by alkylation of aromatic molecules originating from propane. Higher hydrocarbons produce aromatic compounds that act as traps for the activated methane species.

5. Efficiency: Conversion rates of 20-40% are reported for methane coaromatization with higher alkanes or alkenes.

These factors contribute to the industrial significance of these catalysts by enabling the conversion of methane, a relatively inert hydrocarbon, into more valuable aromatic compounds. This process offers an alternative method for converting methane, the principal constituent of natural gas, into more commercially useful chemicals and liquid fuels, addressing a major challenge in modern catalysis.

          金属基催化剂，特别是锌改性高硅沸石的组成、结构和反应条件显著影响烷烃转化的机理和效率：

1. 组成：使用锌改性高硅沸石（如Zn/H-BEA、ZSM-5、ZSM-11）作为催化剂。锌的存在对甲烷的活化和转化至关重要。

2. 结构：沸石结构为金属位点提供了框架。纳米级ZnO簇位于Zn/H-BEA沸石的通道内。ZnO物种与沸石的邻近酸性位点的组合促进了甲烷的解离。

3. 反应条件：温度起着关键作用。甲烷和轻烃的共芳构化发生在700-800K，而在Zn/H-BEA上的甲烷活化从523K开始。在823K时观察到完全转化。

4. 机理：甲烷转化的主要途径涉及在ZnO位点上形成表面甲氧基物种（稳定的甲基阳离子），随后与源自丙烷的芳香族分子发生烷基化。高级烃类产生芳香族化合物，作为活化甲烷物种的捕获剂。

5. 效率：报告指出，甲烷与高级烷烃或烯烃共芳构化的转化率为20-40%。

这些因素通过实现将甲烷（一种相对惰性的碳氢化合物）转化为更有价值的芳香族化合物，为这些催化剂的工业重要性做出了贡献。这个过程为将甲烷（天然气的主要成分）转化为更具商业价值的化学品和液体燃料提供了一种替代方法，解决了现代催化领域的一个主要挑战。
