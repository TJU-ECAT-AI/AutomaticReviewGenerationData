[1] "Coaromatization of methane and light hydrocarbons (paraffins and olefins) at 700800K is one of the alternative methods for the conversion of methane."

[2] "It has been reported recently that the conversion of methane during coaromatization with higher alkanes or alkenes (C2C6) at 670870K in the presence of bifunctional catalysts (mainly, high-silica ZSM-5 or ZSM-11 zeolites, modified with gallium or zinc) may reach 2040%."

[3] "Our data show that the activation of methane on Zn/H-BEA indeed occurs at 523K through the formation of a surface methoxy species (a stabilized methyl cation) (δ=58ppm8 in the 13C CP/MAS NMR spectrum, Figure3a). The initial activation of methane also gives a Zn-CH3 species (δ=21ppm9)."

[4] "The role of the higher hydrocarbon consists of producing aromatic compounds, which further serve as a trap for the methoxy species formed from methane on the Zn sites (Scheme1a)."

Metal-based catalysts, particularly supported vanadium oxides and metal-exchanged zeolites, play a crucial role in alkane transformations. The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of these catalysts significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiency of processes like oxidative dehydrogenation and zeolite-catalyzed reactions.

For zeolite-catalyzed reactions, the literature focuses on Zn-modified high-silica zeolites (Zn/H-BEA) for methane aromatization. The composition of these catalysts, specifically the presence of zinc, is crucial for methane activation. The structure of the zeolite, with nanosized ZnO clusters inside the channels, facilitates the dissociative adsorption of methane.

Reaction conditions, particularly temperature, play a vital role in the efficiency of these transformations. The coaromatization of methane and light hydrocarbons occurs at 700-800K, while the conversion of methane with higher alkanes or alkenes takes place at 670-870K. The activation of methane on Zn/H-BEA begins at a lower temperature of 523K.

The mechanism of methane transformation involves the formation of surface methoxy species and Zn-CH3 species at 523K. The presence of higher hydrocarbons is crucial, as they produce aromatic compounds that act as traps for the methoxy species formed from methane on the Zn sites.

These metal-based catalysts, especially Zn-modified zeolites, have industrial significance due to their ability to convert methane, the principal constituent of natural gas, into more commercially useful chemicals and liquid fuels. The high conversion rates (20-40%) achieved with these catalysts make them potentially valuable for industrial applications in natural gas utilization.

金属基催化剂，特别是负载的钒氧化物和金属交换的沸石，在烷烃转化中起着至关重要的作用。这些催化剂的组成、结构和反应条件显著影响氧化脱氢和沸石催化反应等过程的机理和效率。

对于沸石催化反应，文献着重研究了锌改性的高硅沸石（Zn/H-BEA）在甲烷芳构化中的应用。这些催化剂的组成，特别是锌的存在，对甲烷的活化至关重要。沸石的结构，尤其是通道内的纳米级ZnO簇，有助于甲烷的解离吸附。

反应条件，特别是温度，在这些转化的效率中起着至关重要的作用。甲烷和轻质烃的共芳构化发生在700-800K，而甲烷与高级烷烃或烯烃的转化发生在670-870K。在Zn/H-BEA上，甲烷的活化始于较低的温度523K。

甲烷转化的机理涉及在523K下形成表面甲氧基物种和Zn-CH3物种。高级烃的存在至关重要，因为它们产生芳香化合物，这些化合物作为在锌位点上由甲烷形成的甲氧基物种的捕获剂。

这些金属基催化剂，特别是锌改性沸石，具有工业重要性，因为它们能够将甲烷（天然气的主要成分）转化为更有商业价值的化学品和液体燃料。这些催化剂实现的高转化率（20-40%）使它们在天然气利用的工业应用中具有潜在价值。
