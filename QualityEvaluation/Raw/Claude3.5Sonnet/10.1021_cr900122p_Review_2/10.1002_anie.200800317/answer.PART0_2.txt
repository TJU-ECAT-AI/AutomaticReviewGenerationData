[1] "Coaromatization of methane and light hydrocarbons (paraffins and olefins) at 700800K is one of the alternative methods for the conversion of methane."

[2] "Herein we report that transfer of isotopically 13C-labeled atoms from methane into the aromatic products does occur to a high degree during the co-conversion of methane and propane on the Zn-modified high-silica zeolite BEA."

[3] "Our data show that the activation of methane on Zn/H-BEA indeed occurs at 523K through the formation of a surface methoxy species (a stabilized methyl cation) (δ=58ppm8 in the 13C CP/MAS NMR spectrum, Figure3a)."

[4] "The role of the higher hydrocarbon consists of producing aromatic compounds, which further serve as a trap for the methoxy species formed from methane on the Zn sites (Scheme1a)."

The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations. In this study, a Zn-modified high-silica zeolite BEA catalyst is used for the co-conversion of methane and propane. The presence of zinc in the zeolite structure plays a crucial role in activating methane through the formation of surface methoxy species at 523K.

The reaction conditions, particularly temperature, greatly affect the transformation process. The coaromatization of methane and light hydrocarbons occurs at 700-800K, while the initial activation of methane on Zn/H-BEA happens at a lower temperature of 523K.

The mechanism of alkane transformation in this zeolite-catalyzed reaction involves the formation of aromatic compounds from higher hydrocarbons (e.g., propane), which then act as traps for the methoxy species formed from methane on the Zn sites. This process allows for the efficient incorporation of methane into aromatic products.

The industrial significance of this catalyst and process lies in its ability to convert methane, the principal constituent of natural gas, into more commercially useful chemicals and liquid fuels. This addresses one of the most important challenges in modern catalysis, potentially offering a more efficient route for methane utilization.

金属基催化剂的组成、结构和反应条件显著影响烷烃转化的机理和效率。在这项研究中，使用了锌改性的高硅沸石BEA催化剂来共转化甲烷和丙烷。沸石结构中锌的存在在523K下通过形成表面甲氧基物种激活甲烷方面起着关键作用。

反应条件，特别是温度，极大地影响转化过程。甲烷和轻烃的共芳构化发生在700-800K，而甲烷在Zn/H-BEA上的初始激活发生在较低的523K温度下。

这种沸石催化反应中烷烃转化的机理涉及从高级烃（如丙烷）形成芳香族化合物，这些化合物随后作为在锌位点上由甲烷形成的甲氧基物种的捕获剂。这个过程允许甲烷高效地掺入芳香族产物中。

这种催化剂和过程的工业意义在于它能够将甲烷（天然气的主要成分）转化为更具商业价值的化学品和液体燃料。这解决了现代催化领域最重要的挑战之一，可能为甲烷利用提供更有效的途径。
