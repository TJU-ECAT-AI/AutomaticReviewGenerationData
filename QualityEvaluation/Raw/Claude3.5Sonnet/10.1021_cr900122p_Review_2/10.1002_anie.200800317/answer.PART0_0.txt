[1] "Coaromatization of methane and light hydrocarbons (paraffins and olefins) at 700800K is one of the alternative methods for the conversion of methane."

[2] "Herein we report that transfer of isotopically 13C-labeled atoms from methane into the aromatic products does occur to a high degree during the co-conversion of methane and propane on the Zn-modified high-silica zeolite BEA."

[3] "Our data show that the activation of methane on Zn/H-BEA indeed occurs at 523K through the formation of a surface methoxy species (a stabilized methyl cation) (δ=58ppm8 in the 13C CP/MAS NMR spectrum, Figure3a). The initial activation of methane also gives a Zn-CH3 species (δ=21ppm9)."

[4] "The main pathway for the conversion of methane into aromatic compounds during the course of the methane and propane co-conversion represents the alkylation of propane-originating aromatic molecules by 13CH4. A methoxy species is the intermediate of this reaction (Scheme1a)."

The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations. In this study, a Zn-modified high-silica zeolite BEA catalyst was used for the co-conversion of methane and propane. The zinc modification of the zeolite plays a crucial role in the activation of methane, which occurs at 523K through the formation of surface methoxy species and Zn-CH3 species.

The reaction conditions, particularly temperature, greatly affect the transformation process. The coaromatization of methane and light hydrocarbons occurs at 700-800K, while the initial activation of methane on Zn/H-BEA happens at a lower temperature of 523K. The efficiency of the process is demonstrated by the high degree of transfer of 13C-labeled atoms from methane into aromatic products.

The mechanism of alkane transformation in this zeolite-catalyzed reaction involves the alkylation of propane-originating aromatic molecules by methane, with a methoxy species serving as an intermediate. This mechanism contributes to the industrial significance of the process by enabling the conversion of methane, a relatively inert hydrocarbon, into more valuable aromatic compounds.

The study highlights the importance of metal modification (in this case, zinc) in zeolites for activating methane, which is typically challenging due to its inertness. This understanding can guide the development of more efficient catalysts for industrial alkane transformation processes.

金属基催化剂的组成、结构和反应条件显著影响烷烃转化的机理和效率。在这项研究中，使用了锌改性的高硅沸石BEA催化剂来共转化甲烷和丙烷。沸石的锌改性在甲烷活化中起着关键作用，该过程在523K下通过形成表面甲氧基物种和Zn-CH3物种实现。

反应条件，特别是温度，极大地影响转化过程。甲烷和轻烃的共芳构化发生在700-800K，而甲烷在Zn/H-BEA上的初始活化发生在较低的523K温度下。该过程的效率通过甲烷中13C标记原子向芳香族产物的高度转移得到证实。

这种沸石催化反应中烷烃转化的机理涉及丙烷源芳香族分子被甲烷烷基化，其中甲氧基物种作为中间体。这一机理通过将相对惰性的甲烷转化为更有价值的芳香族化合物，为该过程的工业重要性做出了贡献。

该研究强调了沸石金属改性（在本例中为锌）对于活化甲烷的重要性，而甲烷的活化通常因其惰性而具有挑战性。这一认识可以指导开发更高效的工业烷烃转化过程催化剂。
