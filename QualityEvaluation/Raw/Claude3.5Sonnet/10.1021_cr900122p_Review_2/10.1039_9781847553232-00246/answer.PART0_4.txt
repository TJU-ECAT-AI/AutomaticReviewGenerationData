[1] "The oxidation of n-butane to maleic anhydride is the only industrial process of selective oxidation of a paraffin."

[2] "Since 1974 n-butane has been increasingly used in place of benzene as the raw material for maleic anhydride production for the following reasons: Lower price, High availability in many regions, and Nontoxicity."

[3] "Fixed-bed, moving-bed, and fluidized-bed reactors all use the same type of catalyst, (VO)2P2O7, and no other catalytic composition has been successfully proposed."

[4] "The catalytic behavior of the V-P-based catalysts depends on the following main factors: Method of preparation of the precursor (type of reagents, reducing agents, and solvent; temperature, and dry or wet milling); P/V ratio; Presence of additives; and Methodology of activation and conditioning of the precursor at high temperature."

[5] "Catalysts with a slight excess of phosphorus (P/V=1.05) exhibit the right compromise between reducibility and reoxidizability necessary to obtain both high activity and high selectivity."

The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts, particularly vanadium phosphate catalysts for n-butane oxidation to maleic anhydride, significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations. Key factors include:

1. Catalyst composition: The main active phase is vanadyl pyrophosphate (VO)2P2O7, with a slight excess of phosphorus (P/V ratio around 1.05) providing optimal activity and selectivity.

2. Preparation method: The precursor synthesis, including choice of reagents, reducing agents, solvents, and milling techniques, affects the final catalyst properties.

3. Activation and conditioning: The methodology used to activate and condition the precursor at high temperatures influences the catalyst's performance.

4. Presence of additives: These can modify the catalyst's properties and performance.

5. Reactor type: Fixed-bed, moving-bed, and fluidized-bed reactors are all used industrially, affecting reaction conditions and efficiency.

The industrial significance of this process is due to the selective oxidation of n-butane, a cheaper and more readily available feedstock compared to benzene, which was previously used. The non-toxicity of n-butane also contributes to its industrial importance.

While this literature focuses on vanadium phosphate catalysts for n-butane oxidation, the principles of how composition, structure, and reaction conditions influence catalyst performance are applicable to other metal-based catalysts, including supported vanadium oxides and metal-exchanged zeolites, for various alkane transformation processes.

金属基催化剂的组成、结构和反应条件，特别是用于正丁烷氧化制备马来酸酐的钒磷催化剂，显著影响烷烃转化的机理和效率。关键因素包括：

1. 催化剂组成：主要活性相是焦磷酸钒(VO)2P2O7，略过量的磷（P/V比约为1.05）提供最佳的活性和选择性。

2. 制备方法：前驱体的合成，包括试剂、还原剂、溶剂的选择和研磨技术，影响最终催化剂的性能。

3. 活化和调理：用于在高温下活化和调理前驱体的方法影响催化剂的性能。

4. 添加剂的存在：这些可以修改催化剂的性能和表现。

5. 反应器类型：固定床、移动床和流化床反应器都在工业上使用，影响反应条件和效率。

这个过程的工业重要性在于选择性氧化正丁烷，相比之前使用的苯，正丁烷是一种更便宜、更容易获得的原料。正丁烷的无毒性也contributes to其工业重要性。

虽然这篇文献主要关注正丁烷氧化的钒磷催化剂，但组成、结构和反应条件如何影响催化剂性能的原理适用于其他金属基催化剂，包括负载型钒氧化物和金属交换沸石，用于各种烷烃转化过程。
