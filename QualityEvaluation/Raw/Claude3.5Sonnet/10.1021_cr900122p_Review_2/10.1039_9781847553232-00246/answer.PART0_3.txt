[1] "The oxidation of n-butane to maleic anhydride is the only industrial process of selective oxidation of a paraffin."

[2] "Since 1974 n-butane has been increasingly used in place of benzene as the raw material for maleic anhydride production for the following reasons: Lower price, Nontoxicity, High availability in many regions"

[3] "Fixed-bed: mving-bed:- and fluidized-bed'.' reactors all use the same type of catalyst, (VO)2P207, and no other catalytic composition has been successfully proposed."

[4] "The catalytic behavior of the V-P-based catalysts depends on the following main factors: Method of preparation of the precursor (type of reagents, reducing agents, and solvent; temperature, and dry or wet milling); P/V ratio; Presence of additives; and Methodology of activation and conditioning of the precursor at high temperature."

[5] "By means of XPS analysis, many inestigators,8** with the exception of Okuhara et al.$l have found a higher P/V ratio (in the range 1.5 to 3) on the surface than in the bulk."

[6] "There is a general agreement that a high P/V ratio helps in avoiding the oxidation of v4+ in (VO),P,O,?*J"

[7] "Catalysts with a slight excess of phosphorus (P/V=1.05) exhibit the right compromise between reducibility and reoxidizability necessary to obtain both high activity and high selectivity."

The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts, particularly vanadium phosphate catalysts for n-butane oxidation to maleic anhydride, significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations. Key factors include:

1. Catalyst composition: The main active phase is vanadyl pyrophosphate (VO)2P2O7. The phosphorus to vanadium (P/V) ratio is crucial, with a slight excess of phosphorus (P/V around 1.05) providing the optimal balance between reducibility and oxidizability for high activity and selectivity.

2. Preparation method: The catalyst's performance is influenced by the precursor preparation method, including reagents, reducing agents, solvents, temperature, and milling conditions. These factors affect the morphology and defect structure of the catalyst.

3. Activation and conditioning: The methodology of activating and conditioning the precursor at high temperatures impacts the final catalyst structure and performance.

4. Presence of additives: Additives can modify catalyst properties and performance.

5. Surface composition: The catalyst surface typically has a higher P/V ratio than the bulk, which helps prevent over-oxidation of V4+ species.

6. Reaction conditions: Factors such as reactor type (fixed-bed, moving-bed, or fluidized-bed), temperature, and gas composition affect catalyst performance.

The industrial significance of vanadium phosphate catalysts for n-butane oxidation to maleic anhydride is due to several factors:

1. It is the only industrial process for selective oxidation of a paraffin.
2. n-Butane has replaced benzene as the preferred feedstock due to its lower price, non-toxicity, and high availability.
3. The process achieves high selectivity and yield under optimized conditions.

While the question also mentions supported vanadium oxides, metal-exchanged zeolites, and zeolite-catalyzed reactions, the provided literature does not contain specific information about these topics in relation to alkane transformations.

金属基催化剂的组成、结构和反应条件，特别是用于正丁烷氧化制备顺丁烯二酸酐的钒磷催化剂，显著影响烷烃转化的机理和效率。关键因素包括：

1. 催化剂组成：主要活性相是焦磷酸钒(VO)2P2O7。磷与钒（P/V）的比例至关重要，略微过量的磷（P/V约为1.05）提供了还原性和氧化性之间的最佳平衡，从而实现高活性和高选择性。

2. 制备方法：催化剂的性能受前驱体制备方法的影响，包括试剂、还原剂、溶剂、温度和研磨条件。这些因素影响催化剂的形态和缺陷结构。

3. 活化和调节：在高温下活化和调节前驱体的方法影响最终催化剂的结构和性能。

4. 添加剂的存在：添加剂可以修改催化剂的性质和性能。

5. 表面组成：催化剂表面的P/V比通常高于体相，这有助于防止V4+物种的过度氧化。

6. 反应条件：反应器类型（固定床、移动床或流化床）、温度和气体组成等因素影响催化剂性能。

钒磷催化剂用于正丁烷氧化制备顺丁烯二酸酐的工业重要性源于以下几个因素：

1. 它是目前唯一的烷烃选择性氧化工业过程。
2. 由于价格较低、无毒性和高可用性，正丁烷已取代苯作为首选原料。
3. 在优化条件下，该过程可实现高选择性和高收率。

虽然问题还提到了负载型钒氧化物、金属交换沸石和沸石催化反应，但所提供的文献中并未包含这些主题与烷烃转化相关的具体信息。
