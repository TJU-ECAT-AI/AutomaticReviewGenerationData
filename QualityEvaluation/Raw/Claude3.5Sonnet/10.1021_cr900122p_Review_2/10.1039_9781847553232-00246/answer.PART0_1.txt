The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts, particularly vanadium phosphate catalysts for n-butane oxidation to maleic anhydride, significantly influence their catalytic performance. Key factors include:

1. Catalyst composition: Vanadyl pyrophosphate ((VO)2P2O7) is the main active phase, with a slight excess of phosphorus (P/V ratio around 1.05) providing optimal performance.

2. Catalyst structure: Microcrystalline precursors with preferential exposure of the (001) plane lead to more active and selective catalysts.

3. Preparation method: Synthesis in organic solvents yields catalysts with better morphology and performance compared to aqueous preparation.

4. Activation and conditioning: Proper activation procedures and extended conditioning under reaction conditions are crucial for achieving stable and optimal catalytic behavior.

5. Reaction conditions: Factors such as temperature, n-butane concentration, and oxygen partial pressure affect catalyst performance and stability.

These factors contribute to the industrial significance of vanadium phosphate catalysts by enabling high selectivity and yield in the oxidation of n-butane to maleic anhydride, making it the only successful industrial process for selective oxidation of a paraffin.
