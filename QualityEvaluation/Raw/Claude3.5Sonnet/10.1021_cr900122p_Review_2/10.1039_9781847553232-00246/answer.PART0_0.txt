[1] "The oxidation of n-butane to maleic anhydride is the only industrial process of selective oxidation of a paraffin."

[2] "Since 1974 n-butane has been increasingly used in place of benzene as the raw material for maleic anhydride production for the following reasons: Lower price, High availability in many regions, and Nontoxicity."

[3] "Fixed-bed: mving-bed:- and fluidized-bed reactors all use the same type of catalyst, (VO)2P207, and no other catalytic composition has been successfully proposed."

[4] "The catalytic behavior of the V-P-based catalysts depends on the following main factors: Method of preparation of the precursor (type of reagents, reducing agents, and solvent; temperature, and dry or wet milling); P/V ratio; Presence of additives; and Methodology of activation and conditioning of the precursor at high temperature."

[5] "By means of XPS analysis, many inestigators, with the exception of Okuhara et al., have found a higher P/V ratio (in the range 1.5 to 3) on the surface than in the bulk."

[6] "There is a general agreement that a high P/V ratio helps in avoiding the oxidation of V4+ in (VO)2P2O7."

The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of vanadium phosphate catalysts significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiency of n-butane oxidation to maleic anhydride, which is the only industrial process for selective oxidation of a paraffin. Key factors include:

1. Catalyst composition: The active catalyst is vanadyl pyrophosphate (VO)2P2O7, with no other compositions being successfully used industrially.

2. Preparation method: The catalytic behavior depends on the precursor preparation, including reagents, reducing agents, solvents, temperature, and milling techniques.

3. P/V ratio: A slight excess of phosphorus (P/V ratio 1.01-1.10) is crucial for optimal catalyst performance. A higher P/V ratio on the surface helps prevent oxidation of V4+ to V5+.

4. Additives: The presence of certain additives can affect catalyst properties and performance.

5. Activation and conditioning: The methodology used for activating and conditioning the precursor at high temperatures impacts the final catalyst structure and activity.

6. Reactor type: Fixed-bed, moving-bed, and fluidized-bed reactors all use the same type of catalyst, indicating its versatility in different reactor configurations.

These factors contribute to the industrial significance of vanadium phosphate catalysts for n-butane oxidation by allowing for high selectivity and yield of maleic anhydride, as well as economic advantages such as lower raw material costs and high availability of n-butane compared to previously used benzene.

钒磷催化剂的组成、结构和反应条件显著影响正丁烷氧化生成马来酸酐的机理和效率,这是唯一一个选择性氧化烷烃的工业过程。关键因素包括:

1. 催化剂组成:活性催化剂是焦磷酸钒(VO)2P2O7,没有其他组成能在工业上成功使用。

2. 制备方法:催化性能取决于前驱体的制备,包括试剂、还原剂、溶剂、温度和研磨技术。

3. P/V比:略微过量的磷(P/V比为1.01-1.10)对催化剂的最佳性能至关重要。表面较高的P/V比有助于防止V4+氧化为V5+。

4. 添加剂:某些添加剂的存在可能影响催化剂的性质和性能。

5. 活化和调节:在高温下活化和调节前驱体的方法影响最终催化剂的结构和活性。

6. 反应器类型:固定床、移动床和流化床反应器都使用相同类型的催化剂,表明其在不同反应器配置中的versatility。

这些因素通过允许高选择性和高产率地生产马来酸酐,以及相比先前使用的苯,正丁烷具有较低的原料成本和高可用性等经济优势,从而促进了钒磷催化剂在正丁烷氧化工业中的重要性。
