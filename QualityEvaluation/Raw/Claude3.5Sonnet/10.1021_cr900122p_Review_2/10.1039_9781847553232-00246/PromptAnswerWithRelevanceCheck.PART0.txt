[1] "The oxidation of n-butane to maleic anhydride is the only industrial process of selective oxidation of a paraffin."

[2] "Since 1974 n-butane has been increasingly used in place of benzene as the raw material for maleic anhydride production for the following reasons: Lower price, High availability in many regions, and Nontoxicity."

[3] "Fixed-bed: mving-bed:- and fluidized-bed reactors all use the same type of catalyst, (VO)2P207, and no other catalytic composition has been successfully proposed."

[4] "The catalytic behavior of the V-P-based catalysts depends on the following main factors: Method of preparation of the precursor (type of reagents, reducing agents, and solvent; temperature, and dry or wet milling); P/V ratio; Presence of additives; and Methodology of activation and conditioning of the precursor at high temperature."

[5] "By means of XPS analysis, many inestigators, with the exception of Okuhara et al., have found a higher P/V ratio (in the range 1.5 to 3) on the surface than in the bulk."

The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of vanadium phosphate catalysts significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiency of n-butane oxidation to maleic anhydride, which is the only industrial process for selective oxidation of a paraffin. Key factors include:

1. Catalyst composition: The active catalyst is vanadyl pyrophosphate (VO)2P2O7, with no other compositions being successfully used industrially.

2. Preparation method: The catalytic behavior depends on the precursor preparation, including reagents, reducing agents, solvents, temperature, and milling techniques.

3. P/V ratio: A slight excess of phosphorus (P/V ratio 1.01-1.10) is crucial for optimal catalyst performance. A higher P/V ratio on the surface helps prevent oxidation of V4+ to V5+.

4. Additives: The presence of certain additives can affect catalyst properties and performance.

5. Activation and conditioning: The methodology used for activating and conditioning the precursor at high temperatures impacts the final catalyst structure and activity.

6. Reactor type: Fixed-bed, moving-bed, and fluidized-bed reactors all use the same type of catalyst, indicating its versatility in different reactor configurations.

These factors contribute to the industrial significance of vanadium phosphate catalysts for n-butane oxidation by allowing for high selectivity and yield of maleic anhydride, as well as economic advantages such as lower raw material costs and high availability of n-butane compared to previously used benzene.
