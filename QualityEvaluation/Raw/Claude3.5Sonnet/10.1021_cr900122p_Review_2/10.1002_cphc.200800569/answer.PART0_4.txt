[1] "Zn- or Ga-modified zeolites effectively catalyze the conversion of light alkanes to aromatics with high selectivity."

[2] "The role of the metal species and acid sites of a zeolite in the enhancement of light alkane conversion to aromatics remains a subject of intense controversy, even after significant emphasis and numerous publications."

[3] "There is agreement on the bifunctional nature of these catalysts, where the metal species are responsible for the dehydrogenation of alkanes, while the Brnsted acid sites are involved in the oligomerization and cyclization of olefins."

[4] "When zeolites are modified with Zn, the picture of hydrogen exchange changes. Regioselectivity of the exchange is observed on Zn/H-ZSM-5 and Zn/H-BEA for propane and n-butane."

[5] "A significant increase in the reaction rates with lowering apparent activation energies demonstrate the promoting effect of Zn on the reaction of H/D hydrogen exchange for C1n-C4 alkanes."

[6] "The acceleration of H/D exchange, coupled with the decreased activation energy for Zn-modified zeolites, demonstrates that the CH bonds in alkanes break and form more easily and reversibly with intermediate involvement of Zn species."

[7] "The strong influence of Zn on the activation of CH bonds of small alkanes by the zeolite Brnsted sites is achieved by involvement in the exchange of Znalkyl species, whose formation from alkanes precedes its further involvement in interaction with Brnsted acid sites."

The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations. For zeolite-catalyzed reactions, the addition of metals like Zn or Ga to zeolites enhances the conversion of light alkanes to aromatics. The metal species and acid sites play distinct roles in this process.

The bifunctional nature of these catalysts involves metal species responsible for alkane dehydrogenation, while Brønsted acid sites catalyze olefin oligomerization and cyclization. Zn modification of zeolites alters the hydrogen exchange process, introducing regioselectivity for propane and n-butane.

Zn promotes the activation of C-H bonds in alkanes, as evidenced by increased reaction rates and lower activation energies for H/D exchange. This effect is attributed to the formation of Zn-alkyl species, which interact with Brønsted acid sites, facilitating easier breaking and formation of C-H bonds.

These factors contribute to the industrial significance of metal-modified zeolites by improving catalytic performance in alkane transformation processes. The synergistic effect between metal species and acid sites enhances the overall efficiency of the catalysts, making them more effective for processes like aromatization of light alkanes.

金属基催化剂的组成、结构和反应条件显著影响烷烃转化的机理和效率。对于沸石催化反应，向沸石中添加锌或镓等金属可以增强轻烷烃向芳烃的转化。金属物种和酸性位点在这个过程中发挥不同的作用。

这些催化剂的双功能性质涉及负责烷烃脱氢的金属物种，而Brønsted酸位点催化烯烃的寡聚和环化。锌对沸石的改性改变了氢交换过程，为丙烷和正丁烷引入了区域选择性。

锌促进了烷烃中C-H键的活化，这从H/D交换反应速率的增加和活化能的降低可以看出。这种效应归因于锌-烷基物种的形成，它们与Brønsted酸位点相互作用，促进C-H键更容易断裂和形成。

这些因素通过提高烷烃转化过程中的催化性能，增加了金属改性沸石的工业重要性。金属物种和酸性位点之间的协同效应提高了催化剂的整体效率，使它们更有效地用于轻烷烃芳构化等过程。
