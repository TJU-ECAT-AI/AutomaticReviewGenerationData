Significant Influence of Zn on Activation of the C-H Bonds
of Small Alkanes by Brnsted Acid Sites of Zeolite**

1. Introduction
Zn- or Ga-modified zeolites effectively catalyze the conversion
of light alkanes to aromatics with high selectivity.[14] The role
of the metal species and acid sites of a zeolite in the enhance-
ment of light alkane conversion to aromatics remains a subject
of intense controversy, even after significant emphasis and nu-
merous publications.[1,2,516] On the one hand, there is agree-
ment on the bifunctional nature of these catalysts, where the
metal species are responsible for the dehydrogenation of alka-
nes, while the Brnsted acid sites are involved in the oligo-
ACHTUNGTRENUNGmerization and cyclization of olefins.[3,17] On the other hand, it
has been claimed that the activation and cleavage of CH
bonds of alkanes occurs predominantly at the Brnsted acid
sites.[2,11,13] Ga or Zn act as portholes and catalyze the recom-
binative desorption of H atoms, formed from acid-catalyzed
CH bond cleavage, as dihydrogen (H2).[2] Desorption of hydro-
gen species shifts the equilibrium towards the formation of
olefins and suppresses hydrogen transfer to hydrocarbon spe-
cies, leading to ethane and methane. Further olefin oligomeri-
zation and dehydrocyclization give aromatic species. In both
cases, the activation of the alkane by the Brnsted acid sites is
assumed to be independent of metal species present in zeo-
lites.[2,3,11,13,17]
A simple reaction of hydrogen exchange between the acid
sites of solid catalysts and alkane molecules, which usually pre-
cedes the chemical transformation of alkanes by the cata-
lysts,[18] is often used to characterize the activation of alkanes
and the acidity of the catalysts.[1934] Valuable information on
the peculiarities of alkane molecule activation has been ob-
tained by monitoring H/D exchange for alkanes with 1H MAS
NMR in situ.[28,3538] The application of this techniques to the
study of H/D exchange on Zn- or Ga-modified zeolites could
provide a pathway for clarifying a possible role of metal spe-
cies in the activation of small alkane molecules by zeolite acid
SiOHAl groups that act as Brnsted sites.
Herein, we have performed a comparative analysis of the ki-
netics of H/D exchange for C1n-C4 alkanes with the purely
acidic and the Zn-modified zeolites BEA and ZSM-5, respective-
ly.[28,36,37] This allows us to clarify important mechanistic details
of alkane activation by Brnsted acid sites upon modification
of the zeolites by Zn.
2. Results and Discussion
In accordance with the HaagDessau mechanism,[39] the activa-
tion of alkane CH bonds by acidic zeolites is performed by
protonation by the zeolites Brnsted acid site. The pentacoor-
dinated carbonium ion formed thus yields molecular hydrogen
and a carbenium ion. Deprotonation of the latter produces an
olefin and recovers the Brnsted acid site. The hydrogen H/D
exchange also involves the transfer of the hydrogen atom of
an acidic OH group to a carbon atom of the alkane, with syn-
chronous reversible transfer of one of the hydrogen atoms of
the alkane to the oxygen atom of the zeolite framework.[19]
The pentacoordinated carbonium ion represents a transition
state in this reaction. The similarity of the pathways of alkane
Herein, we analyze earlier obtained and new data about peculiar-
ities of the H/D hydrogen exchange of small C1n-C4 alkanes on
Zn-modified high-silica zeolites ZSM-5 and BEA in comparison
with the exchange for corresponding purely acidic forms of these
zeolites. This allows us to identify an evident promoting effect of
Zn on the activation of CH bonds of alkanes by zeolite Brnsted
sites. The effect of Zn is demonstrated by observing the regio-
ACHTUNGTRENUNGselectivity of the H/D exchange for propane and n-butane as well
as by the increase in the rate and a decrease in the apparent ac-
tivation energy of the exchange for all C1n-C4 alkanes upon
modification of zeolites with Zn. The influence of Zn on alkane
activation has been rationalized by dissociative adsorption of al-
kanes on Zn oxide species inside zeolite pores, which precedes
the interaction of alkane with Brnsted acid sites.

activation and the hydrogen exchange reaction allows one to
use H/D exchange as a test reaction for alkane activation.
Hydrogen exchange between small alkanes and Brnsted
acid sites occurs within the temperature range of 523723 K
on acid-form zeolites.[1935,40] The apparent activation energies
are in the range of 107147 kJmol1. Methane and ethane ex-
change with involvement of pentacoordinated carbonium ions
as transition states on acidic zeolites. Propane can alternatively
be exchanged with the intermediate formation of a carbenium
ion intermediate. In this case, the regioselectivity of the ex-
change into the methyl groups is detected.[34,41]
Figures 1A and C demonstrate the involvement of both the
methyl and the methylene groups of [D8]propane and [D10]n-
butane in the exchange with acidic SiOHAl groups on zeolite
H-ZSM-5. Indeed, the intensities of signals at 1.0 (CH3) and
1.5 ppm (CH2) of a 1H MAS NMR spectrum increase with the re-
action time. This corresponds to a transfer of a protium from
the acidic SiOHAl group of the zeolite to the methyl and meth-
ylene groups of the perdeuterated alkanes. It has been estab-
lished that exchange with both
the methyl and the methylene
groups occur, with the inter-
mediate formation of pentacoor-
dinated carbonium ions as tran-
sition
states.
The
activation
energy of the exchange is 107
108 kJmol1
for
both
pro-
pane[28,35] and n-butane.[42]
When zeolites
are modified
with Zn, the picture of hydrogen
exchange changes. Regioselec-
tivity of the exchange is ob-
served on Zn/H-ZSM-5 and Zn/
H-BEA
for
propane
and
n-
butane. The methyl groups of
these alkanes are preferentially
involved in the exchange. This
corresponds to the growth in
the intensity of the only methyl
peak (at 1.0 ppm) with the reac-
tion time in 1H MAS NMR spectra
(Figure 1B,D,E,F). Kinetics param-
eters
of
the
exchange
also
change with regard to those on
pure acid-form zeolites. While
apparent activation energies are
similar or notably lower for Zn-
modified zeolites in comparison
to acid-form zeolites, the rate of
the
exchange
is
essentially
higher for Zn-modified zeolites
within
the
same
temperature
range. The temperature thres-
ACHTUNGTRENUNGhold of the reaction onset de-

and Table 1).
Similar
tendencies
in
the
change of kinetic parameters of the exchange upon modifica-
tion of BEA and ZSM-5 with Zn are also observed for methane
and ethane. Figure 3 shows Arrhenius plots for the H/D ex-

change reaction of methane and ethane on H-BEA, H-ZSM-5
and Zn/H-BEA.
It can be seen that the exchange is more than two orders of
magnitude faster on Zn/H-BEA than that on a purely acidic
form of the zeolites. The activation energies of the exchange
for
methane
on
H-BEA
(138 kJmol1)
and
H-ZSM-5
(118 kJmol1) are similar to those earlier identified for meth-
ane[24] and ethane[25] on acid-form zeolites. The kinetics para-
ACHTUNGTRENUNGmeters for H-BEA and H-ZSM-5 correspond to the mechanism
of exchange with synchronous transfer of protons from the
zeolite SiOHAl group to the alkane molecule and the symmet-
rical return of one of the hydrogen atoms from the alkane to
the oxygen atom of the zeolite framework via a pentacoordi-
nated carbon atom in a transition state.[19]
The rate of H/D exchange increases by more than two
orders of magnitude for methane and ethane when the zeolite
is modified with Zn. The apparent activation energies decrease
to 8688 kJmol1. At the same time, the reaction onset is de-
creased by 100 K.
A significant increase in the reaction rates with lowering ap-
parent activation energies demonstrate the promoting effect
of Zn on the reaction of H/D hydrogen exchange for C1n-C4
alkanes. Also, the regioselectivity of H/D exchange for propane
and n-butane, is clearly due to the presence of the Zn species
in the modified zeolite.
Altogether, a dramatic change in the kinetic parameters of
H/D exchange occurs upon modification of zeolites with Zn.
The
acceleration
of
H/D
ex-
change of the C1n-C4 alkanes as
well
as
the
regioselective
in-
volvement of only the methyl
sites of propane and n-butane in
the exchange point to enhance-
ment by Zn species of the reac-
tion with Brnsted acid sites.
The
acceleration
of
H/D
ex-
change, coupled with the de-
creased activation energy for Zn-
modified zeolites, demonstrates that the CH bonds in alkanes
break and form more easily and reversibly with intermediate
involvement of Zn species.
There are two reasonable possibilities to account for the
promoting effect of Zn on H/D exchange: 1) the intermediate
formation of an olefin[33,43] during dehydrogenation on Zn cat-
ions, representing the Lewis acid sites, or 2) the involvement of
Zn alkyl species, formed by the dissociative adsorption of the
alkane.[4446] The first possibility only accounts for the regiose-
lective exchange of propane and the exchange in ethane. The
intermediate formation of the olefin and its further protona-
tion/deprotonation cannot account for the regioselectivity of
H/D exchange for the methyl groups of n-butane. For the ex-
change with n-butane, the expected regioselectivity would be
for the methylene groups if butene were formed.[43] Moreover,
the promoting effect of Zn on the exchange in methane
cannot be rationalized by the involvement of an intermediate
alkene, which cannot be formed from methane.
Involvement of the intermediate Zn-alkyl species in the H/D
exchange accounts for the promoting effect of Zn on the reac-
tion of H/D exchange for all C1n-C4 alkanes. The possibility of
the formation of Zn-alkyl species upon alkane adsorption on
Zn-modified zeolites was concluded from IR studies earlier[44,45]
and we confirmed their formation by 13C MAS NMR for the zeo-
lite samples used in this study.[4648] For zeolites with a high Zn
content (78 wt%, in our case), the formation of a Zn alkyl spe-
cies presumably occurs at small ZnO clusters existing inside
the zeolite pores.[46]
The pathway of H/D exchange for C1n-C4 alkanes with the
involvement of Zn alkyl species is outlined in Scheme 1 (Path-
way 1). Dissociative adsorption of the deuterated alkane on Zn
oxide sites, which precedes H/D exchange, leads to Znalkyl
species and ZnOD groups. Protonation of the Znalkyl spe-
cies by the vicinal acidic OH group of the zeolite with synchro-
nous reverse transfer of the deuterium from the ZnOD to the
zeolite acid site, finally provide a transfer of protium from the
SiOHAl group of the zeolite to the deuterated alkane molecule.
This mechanism could provide significantly different kinetic pa-
rameters for the exchange from those for purely acidic zeolite.
The mechanism also rationalizes the involvement of only the
methyl groups of C3 and n-C4 alkanes in the exchange. Only
the hydrogens of the CH2 group, attached to Zn directly, can
be involved in the exchange. So, the data are an experimental
demonstration of the synergetic action suggested earlier[10,4951]
of Zn species and acid sites in the breaking and formation of
the CH bonds in alkane during its activation.

Influence of Zn on CH Bond Activation
It becomes clear from our data that the activation of CH
bonds of small alkanes by zeolite Brnsted acid sites depends
on Zn species, which form an intermediate with the alkane.
One can assume that the interaction of the Znalkyl species
with zeolite acid sites can provide not only the H/D exchange
reaction, but also a dehydrogenation step (Scheme 1, Path-
way 2), yielding olefins for the subsequent aromatization steps.
Pathway 2 rationalizes the synergy of the acid and the Zn-sites
(as ZnO clusters) for the effective aromatization of small alka-
nes by Zn-modified zeolites.[10] Synergetic action of Zn and
Brnsted sites in enhancing aromatization ability[10,4951] could
be achieved by involvement in the activation of the alkane
CH bond of both the zeolite acid OH groups and the Zn
alkyl species formed on Zn sites. The intermediate or transition
state, which involves the zeolite acid sites and the alkane-and-
Zn sites leads to alkane dehydrogenationpresumably by the
energetically most favorable way. Thus, the enhancement of
alkane conversion towards the formation of aromatic mole-
cules on Zn-modified zeolites could be achieved. So, the effect
of Zn, which earlier was attributed either to the dehydrogena-
tion ability of the loaded metal[3,17] or its ability to afford the
recombinative desorption of H atoms,[2,11,13] is shown to be the
direct influence of Zn on the activation of alkane CH bonds
by the catalysts Brnsted acid sites.
3. Conclusions
In situ NMR monitoring of H/D exchange reactions offers im-
portant information for clarifying the peculiarities of C1n-C4
alkane activation by Zn-modified high-silica zeolites. Modifica-
tion of the zeolite with Zn provides regioselectivity of the H/D
hydrogen exchange and gives rise to an increase in the rate
and a decrease in the activation energy for H/D exchange. The
strong influence of Zn on the activation of CH bonds of small
alkanes by the zeolite Brnsted sites is achieved by involve-
ment in the exchange of Znalkyl species, whose formation
from alkanes precedes its further involvement in interaction
with Brnsted acid sites.
Experimental Section
Materials and Sample Preparation:
The
Zn-modified
zeolites,
Zn/
H-BEA (Si/Al=18, 7.2 wt% Zn) and
Zn/H-ZSM-5
(Si/Al=35,
8.0 wt%
Zn), were prepared by impregna-
tion of the corresponding acidic
forms with saturated solutions of
Zn formate and ZnACHTUNGTRENUNG(NO3)2, respec-
tively, with subsequent drying at
473 K for 14 h and further calcina-
tion at 673823 K for 46 h in a
flow of air. All materials were char-
acterized
by
chemical
analysis,
XRD, SEM, TEM, UV/Vis, IR, and 1H,
27Al, and 29Si MAS NMR spectrosco-
py. The parent samples contained
no
extra-framework
aluminium,
but
a
small
quantity
of
extra-
framework aluminium (<2%) was
created during the sample activa-
tion procedure as was confirmed by 1H and 27Al MAS NMR.[37] XRD
analysis indicated the presence of bulk ZnO in the Zn-modified
zeolites and SEM confirmed the presence of ZnO as clusters of
50100 nm on the surface of crystallites of both zeolites. UV/Vis
diffuse reflectance spectra of Zn/H-BEA and Zn/H-ZSM-5 have
shown the presence of sub-nanometric ZnO clusters and macro-
crystalline particles of ZnO on the extra surface of the zeolite, ex-
hibiting bands at 265 and 370 nm, respectively.[52] Simple estima-
tions derived from XRD data and FTIR data suggest that most of
the Zn species in both samples is present in the form of sub-nano-
meric ZnO clusters inside the zeolitic pores. The estimates of the
acidic OH group quantity were made from the analysis of the in-
tensities of corresponding signals of SiOHAl groups in
1H MAS
NMR spectra of zeolites with adsorbed methane as internal stan-
dard. The residual quantity of the acidic AlOHSi groups in a final
Zn/H-ZSM-5 was 150 mmolg1, whereas the quantity of these
groups was 460 mmolg1 in the parent H-ZSM-5. For BEA zeolite,
the residual quantity of the AlOHSi groups in a final Zn/H-BEA was
320 mmolg1,
whereas
the
quantity
of
these
groups
was
480 mmolg1 in the parent H-BEA.
Analysis of the IR bands from CO adsorbed on Zn-modified zeolites
have shown the presence of isolated Zn2+ cations, besides small
ZnO clusters and bulk ZnO. The nitrogen adsorption data have
shown the decrease of pore volume by 510% upon impregna-
tion of acid form zeolites with Zn formate or nitrate due to deposi-
tion of ZnO particles inside the pores of both ZSM-5 and BEA. De-
tailed characteristics of the zeolite catalysts used are provided else-
where.[37,46]
Perdeuterated C1n-C4 alkanes (99% D) purchased from Aldrich
Chemical Company Inc. C1C3 were used without further purifica-
tion, whereas n-C4 was additionally purified from admixed olefins
by several cycles of adsorptiondesorption on zeolite mordenite
(H-MOR) at 373 K. The samples for NMR measurements were pre-
pared by heating 80 mg of the zeolite sample in the glass tubes of
5.5 mm outer diameter. The samples were activated by an increase
of the temperature from 300 to 673 K at the rate of 10 Kh1 under
vacuum. Further, the samples were maintained at 673 K for 24 h
under vacuum (less than 102 Pa). The loading was performed at
room temperature with 14 molecules of alkane per unit cell and
each sample was then sealed off (length of the glass tube=
10 mm). This glass tube could be tightly inserted in 7 mm zirconia

rotors. Before acquisition of the signal, the NMR probe with the
sample was preheated for 20 min at the temperature at which the
H/D exchange did not yet occur at notable rate. Then the tempera-
ture was rapidly increased within 310 min by 40100 K to the re-
action temperature, equilibrated for 12 min, and then the acquisi-
tion of NMR signal started. It should be noted here that any notice-
able chemical conversion of alkanes did not occur under condi-
tions of our experiment, so the H/D exchange was the main trans-
formation of the alkanes.
NMR measurements: In situ 1H MAS NMR kinetic measurements of
H/D exchange reaction were performed on a Bruker Avance-400
(9.4 T magnetic field) spectrometer equipped with a high-tempera-
ture probe from Bruker Biospin, and using a protocol of NMR kinet-
ics measurements, described in ref. [28]. Zirconia rotors (7 mm
outer diameter) with the inserted sealed glass tube samples were
spun at 3 kHz by dried compressed air at 420560 K. 1H MAS spec-
tra were recorded by the Hahn-echo pulse sequence (p/2-t-p-t-ac-
quisition), where t equals to one rotor period (333 ms). The chemi-
cal shifts were referenced to TMS. The sample temperature was
controlled by the Bruker BVT-2000 variable-temperature unit. The
calibration of the temperature inside the rotor was performed with
an accuracy of 2 K by using lead nitrate, located inside the rotor,
as a 207Pb MAS NMR chemical shift thermometer.[53]
