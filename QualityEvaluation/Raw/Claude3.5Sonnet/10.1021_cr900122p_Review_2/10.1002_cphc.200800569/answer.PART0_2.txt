[1] "Zn- or Ga-modified zeolites effectively catalyze the conversion of light alkanes to aromatics with high selectivity."

[2] "When zeolites are modified with Zn, the picture of hydrogen exchange changes. Regioselectivity of the exchange is observed on Zn/H-ZSM-5 and Zn/H-BEA for propane and n-butane."

[3] "A significant increase in the reaction rates with lowering apparent activation energies demonstrate the promoting effect of Zn on the reaction of H/D hydrogen exchange for C1n-C4 alkanes."

[4] "The strong influence of Zn on the activation of CH bonds of small alkanes by the zeolite Brnsted sites is achieved by involvement in the exchange of Znalkyl species, whose formation from alkanes precedes its further involvement in interaction with Brnsted acid sites."

The composition and structure of metal-based catalysts significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations. Specifically for metal-exchanged zeolites:

1. Zn or Ga modification of zeolites enhances the conversion of light alkanes to aromatics with high selectivity.

2. Zn modification changes the hydrogen exchange behavior, introducing regioselectivity for propane and n-butane on Zn/H-ZSM-5 and Zn/H-BEA zeolites.

3. Zn promotes H/D hydrogen exchange for C1-C4 alkanes, increasing reaction rates and lowering activation energies.

4. The mechanism involves Zn-alkyl species formation, which then interact with zeolite Brønsted acid sites, strongly influencing CH bond activation.

These factors contribute to the industrial significance of metal-modified zeolites by improving catalytic performance in alkane transformation processes. The synergistic effect between metal species and acid sites enhances reaction efficiency and selectivity, making these catalysts valuable for industrial applications in petrochemical processes.

金属基催化剂的组成和结构显著影响烷烃转化的机理和效率。具体对于金属交换的沸石：

1. 锌或镓对沸石的改性提高了轻烷烃向芳烃的高选择性转化。

2. 锌改性改变了氢交换行为，在Zn/H-ZSM-5和Zn/H-BEA沸石上引入了丙烷和正丁烷的区域选择性。

3. 锌促进了C1-C4烷烃的H/D氢交换，提高了反应速率并降低了活化能。

4. 其机理涉及锌-烷基物种的形成，然后与沸石的布朗斯特酸位点相互作用，强烈影响CH键的活化。

这些因素通过改善烷烃转化过程中的催化性能，提高了金属改性沸石的工业重要性。金属物种和酸性位点之间的协同作用提高了反应效率和选择性，使这些催化剂在石油化工过程中具有重要的工业应用价值。
