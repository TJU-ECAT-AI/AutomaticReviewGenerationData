[1] "Previous studies have shown that supported vanadia is the most active and selective simple metal oxide for alkane ODH, because its reducible nature leads to the rapid redox cycles required for a catalytic turnover (15)."

[2] "UVvisible spectroscopy suggests that V5+ is present in distorted tetrahedrally coordinated species at low vanadia surface densities and that some of these tetrahedrally coordinated cations remain at higher surface densities, coexisting with an increasing fraction of V5+ present in distorted tetragonal pyramidal coordination, similar to that present in V2O5 (25)."

[3] "For both ethane and propane reactants, these apparent turnover rates reach a maximum at intermediate vanadia surface densities. The maximum rate is reached at a surface VOx density of 8 V/nm2 for both reactants, and this maximum rate is about four times greater than that obtained on the VOx/Al2O3 sample with the lowest surface density (1.4 V/nm2)."

[4] "Ethane ODH at zero conversion is 75% selective to ethene and insensitive to vanadia surface density, while initial propene selectivities during propane ODH approach 90% at low vanadia surface densities, but decrease with increasing vanadia surface density."

[5] "Therefore, the highest olefin yields are obtained on catalysts containing isolated monovanadates and operated at the highest possible reaction temperature consistent with the avoidance of homogeneous reactions."

The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts, particularly supported vanadium oxides, significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations in oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) processes.

Composition: Supported vanadia is reported to be the most active and selective simple metal oxide for alkane ODH due to its reducible nature, which enables rapid redox cycles necessary for catalytic turnover.

Structure: The vanadia surface density plays a crucial role in catalyst performance. At low surface densities, V5+ is present in distorted tetrahedrally coordinated species. As surface density increases, these coexist with an increasing fraction of V5+ in distorted tetragonal pyramidal coordination, similar to V2O5. The catalyst structure evolves from isolated monovanadates to polyvanadates and eventually V2O5 crystallites as surface density increases.

Reaction conditions: Temperature is a key factor affecting catalyst performance. Higher temperatures generally lead to increased alkene selectivity, but must be balanced against the onset of undesired homogeneous reactions.

Efficiency: Turnover rates for both ethane and propane ODH reach a maximum at intermediate vanadia surface densities (around 8 V/nm2), with rates about four times higher than at the lowest surface density (1.4 V/nm2). This suggests that oligomeric VOx structures are more active than isolated species.

Selectivity: For ethane ODH, selectivity to ethene is about 75% and relatively insensitive to vanadia surface density. For propane ODH, initial propene selectivities approach 90% at low vanadia surface densities but decrease as surface density increases.

Industrial significance: The highest olefin yields are obtained on catalysts containing isolated monovanadates operated at high temperatures while avoiding homogeneous reactions. This insight can guide the design of more efficient industrial catalysts for alkane ODH processes.

The study does not provide information about zeolite-catalyzed reactions, so that part of the question cannot be addressed based on the given literature.

金属基催化剂的组成、结构和反应条件，特别是负载型钒氧化物，显著影响烷烃转化过程中的氧化脱氢（ODH）机理和效率。

组成：据报道，负载型钒是最活跃和选择性最高的简单金属氧化物，用于烷烃ODH，这是因为其可还原性能够实现快速氧化还原循环，这对催化周转至关重要。

结构：钒的表面密度在催化剂性能中起着关键作用。在低表面密度下，V5+以扭曲的四面体配位形式存在。随着表面密度增加，这些物种与越来越多的扭曲四方锥配位的V5+共存，类似于V2O5。随着表面密度增加，催化剂结构从孤立的单钒酸盐演变为多钒酸盐，最终形成V2O5晶体。

反应条件：温度是影响催化剂性能的关键因素。较高的温度通常会导致烯烃选择性增加，但必须权衡不希望出现的均相反应的开始。

效率：乙烷和丙烷ODH的周转速率在中等钒表面密度（约8 V/nm2）时达到最大值，其速率约为最低表面密度（1.4 V/nm2）时的四倍。这表明寡聚的VOx结构比孤立物种更活跃。

选择性：对于乙烷ODH，乙烯的选择性约为75%，对钒表面密度相对不敏感。对于丙烷ODH，在低钒表面密度下，初始丙烯选择性接近90%，但随着表面密度增加而降低。

工业意义：在高温下操作含有孤立单钒酸盐的催化剂，同时避免均相反应，可获得最高的烯烃产率。这一见解可以指导更高效的工业催化剂设计，用于烷烃ODH过程。
