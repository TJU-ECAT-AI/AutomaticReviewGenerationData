[1] "VOx/Al2O3 catalysts were prepared by incipient wetness impregnation of fumed γ-alumina (Degussa, AG, 100 m2/g) with an aqueous solution of ammonium metavanadate (99%, Aldrich, Inc.) and oxalic acid (Mallinckrodt analytical grade) in a 1 : 2 weight ratio (12) with a pH of 2."

[2] "Diffuse reflectance UVvisible spectra were measured with a VarianCary 4 spectrophotometer equipped with a Harrickdiffusereflectanceattachment.Samplesweredehydrated in 20% O2/He (1.67 cm3 s1(STP), Praxair, 99.99%) at 723 K before measuring spectra at ambient temperature between 1 and 5 eV."

[3] "Raman spectra were obtained using a Hololab Series 5000 Raman spectrometer (Kaiser Optical) with a frequency-doubled 75-mW Nd-YAG laser at a wavelength of 532 nm."

[4] "Reaction rate and selectivity data were measured in a packed-bed flow reactor with plug-flow hydrodynamics (24). VOx/Al2O3 catalysts (0.010.3 g) were diluted with quartz granules (180- to 355-m diameter, 0.010.3 g) in order to prevent bed temperature gradients."

[5] "Ethane ODH reactions were examined at 663743 K, while the faster propane ODH reactions were examined at lower temperatures (603663 K)."

[6] "For both ethane and propane reactants, these apparent turnover rates reach a maximum at intermediate vanadia surface densities. The maximum rate is reached at a surface VOx density of 8 V/nm2 for both reactants, and this maximum rate is about four times greater than that obtained on the VOx/Al2O3 sample with the lowest surface density (1.4 V/nm2)."

[7] "For ethane, k2/k1 is essentially independent of VOx surface density, but this ratio increases with increasing VOx surface density for propane reactants."

[8] "Alkene selectivity generally increases with increasing reaction temperature and with decreasing vanadia surface density. Therefore, the highest olefin yields are obtained on catalysts containing isolated monovanadates and operated at the highest possible reaction temperature consistent with the avoidance of homogeneous reactions."

The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of supported vanadium oxide catalysts significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations in oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) processes:

1. Composition: VOx/Al2O3 catalysts are prepared by impregnating γ-alumina with ammonium metavanadate and oxalic acid solutions. The vanadia surface density greatly affects catalyst performance.

2. Structure: At low surface densities, isolated monovanadate species predominate. As density increases, two-dimensional polyvanadates form, followed by three-dimensional V2O5 crystallites. These structural changes impact catalytic activity and selectivity.

3. Reaction conditions: 
   - Temperature: Ethane ODH is conducted at 663-743 K, while propane ODH occurs at 603-663 K. Higher temperatures generally increase alkene selectivity.
   - Reactor design: A packed-bed flow reactor with plug-flow hydrodynamics is used, with catalyst dilution to prevent temperature gradients.

4. Catalytic performance:
   - Activity: Turnover rates for both ethane and propane ODH reach a maximum at intermediate vanadia surface densities (8 V/nm2).
   - Selectivity: Initial ethene selectivity is about 75% and relatively independent of surface density. Propene selectivity can reach 90% at low surface densities but decreases with increasing density.
   - The ratio of alkane combustion to dehydrogenation (k2/k1) is independent of surface density for ethane but increases with density for propane.

5. Optimal conditions: The highest olefin yields are obtained using catalysts with isolated monovanadates operated at the highest possible temperature without causing homogeneous reactions.

These factors contribute to the industrial significance of supported vanadium oxide catalysts for alkane ODH by allowing for the tuning of catalyst composition and reaction conditions to maximize desired product yields while minimizing unwanted side reactions.

支持的钒氧化物催化剂的组成、结构和反应条件显著影响烷烃在氧化脱氢(ODH)过程中的转化机理和效率：

1. 组成：VOx/Al2O3催化剂是通过将γ-氧化铝浸渍于偏钒酸铵和草酸溶液中制备的。钒的表面密度极大地影响催化剂的性能。

2. 结构：在低表面密度下，以孤立的单钒酸盐物种为主。随着密度增加，形成二维多钒酸盐，然后是三维V2O5晶体。这些结构变化影响催化活性和选择性。

3. 反应条件：
   - 温度：乙烷ODH在663-743 K下进行，而丙烷ODH在603-663 K下进行。较高的温度通常会增加烯烃的选择性。
   - 反应器设计：使用具有塞流流体动力学的填充床流动反应器，并稀释催化剂以防止温度梯度。

4. 催化性能：
   - 活性：乙烷和丙烷ODH的转化率在中等钒表面密度（8 V/nm2）时达到最大值。
   - 选择性：初始乙烯选择性约为75%，与表面密度关系不大。丙烯选择性在低表面密度时可达90%，但随着密度增加而下降。
   - 烷烃燃烧与脱氢的比率（k2/k1）对于乙烷来说与表面密度无关，但对于丙烷来说随密度增加而增加。

5. 最佳条件：使用含有孤立单钒酸盐的催化剂，在不引起均相反应的情况下，在尽可能高的温度下操作，可获得最高的烯烃产率。

这些因素通过允许调整催化剂组成和反应条件以最大化所需产品产率，同时最小化不需要的副反应，从而为烷烃ODH的支持钒氧化物催化剂的工业重要性做出贡献。
