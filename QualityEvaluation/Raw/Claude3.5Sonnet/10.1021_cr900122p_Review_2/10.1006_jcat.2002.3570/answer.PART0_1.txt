[1] "Previous studies have shown that supported vanadia is the most active and selective simple metal oxide for alkane ODH, because its reducible nature leads to the rapid redox cycles required for a catalytic turnover (15)."

[3] "UVvisible spectroscopy suggests that V5+ is present in distorted tetrahedrally coordinated species at low vanadia surface densities and that some of these tetrahedrally coordinated cations remain at higher surface densities, coexisting with an increasing fraction of V5+ present in distorted tetragonal pyramidal coordination, similar to that present in V2O5 (25)."

[4] "For both ethane and propane reactants, these apparent turnover rates reach a maximum at intermediate vanadia surface densities. The maximum rate is reached at a surface VOx density of 8 V/nm2 for both reactants, and this maximum rate is about four times greater than that obtained on the VOx/Al2O3 sample with the lowest surface density (1.4 V/nm2)."

[5] "The ratio of k2/k1 is independent of surface density for ethane and increases with increasing vanadia surface density for propane (Fig. 8). The ratio of k3/k1 increases with increasing vanadia surface density for both reactants (Fig. 10)."

The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts, particularly supported vanadium oxides, significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations in oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) processes.

Composition: Supported vanadia is reported to be the most active and selective simple metal oxide for alkane ODH due to its reducible nature, which facilitates rapid redox cycles necessary for catalytic turnover.

Structure: The surface density of vanadium oxide (VOx) plays a crucial role in catalytic performance. At low surface densities, V5+ is present in distorted tetrahedrally coordinated species. As surface density increases, these coexist with an increasing fraction of V5+ in distorted tetragonal pyramidal coordination. The structure of VOx domains affects the acid-base properties of the catalyst surface, which in turn influences reaction rates and selectivity.

Reaction conditions: Temperature is a key factor. Higher temperatures generally lead to increased alkene selectivity, but must be balanced against the onset of undesired homogeneous reactions.

Efficiency: Apparent turnover rates for both ethane and propane ODH reach a maximum at intermediate vanadia surface densities (around 8 V/nm2), with rates about four times greater than those observed at the lowest surface density (1.4 V/nm2).

Mechanisms: The ratios of rate constants for different reaction pathways (k2/k1 and k3/k1) vary with vanadia surface density and reactant type, affecting product selectivity. For ethane, k2/k1 is independent of surface density, while for propane, it increases with increasing surface density. The k3/k1 ratio increases with surface density for both reactants.

Industrial significance: The highest olefin yields are obtained on catalysts containing isolated monovanadates operated at the highest possible reaction temperature that avoids homogeneous reactions. This understanding allows for the design of more efficient industrial catalysts for alkane transformation processes.

While the document focuses on supported vanadium oxides and does not provide information on metal-exchanged zeolites, the principles of how catalyst composition, structure, and reaction conditions affect performance are likely applicable to other metal-based catalytic systems as well.

金属基催化剂的组成、结构和反应条件，特别是负载型钒氧化物，显著影响烷烃转化过程中的氧化脱氢（ODH）机理和效率。

组成：据报道，负载型钒氧化物是最活跃和最具选择性的简单金属氧化物，用于烷烃ODH，这是由于其可还原性质，促进了催化循环所需的快速氧化还原循环。

结构：钒氧化物（VOx）的表面密度在催化性能中起着关键作用。在低表面密度下，V5+以扭曲的四面体配位形式存在。随着表面密度的增加，这些物种与越来越多的扭曲四方锥配位的V5+共存。VOx结构影响催化剂表面的酸碱性质，进而影响反应速率和选择性。

反应条件：温度是一个关键因素。较高的温度通常会导致烯烃选择性增加，但必须与不希望出现的均相反应的开始平衡。

效率：乙烷和丙烷ODH的表观转化率在中等钒氧化物表面密度（约8 V/nm2）时达到最大值，比最低表面密度（1.4 V/nm2）时观察到的速率高约四倍。

机理：不同反应途径的速率常数比（k2/k1和k3/k1）随钒氧化物表面密度和反应物类型而变化，影响产物选择性。对于乙烷，k2/k1与表面密度无关，而对于丙烷，它随表面密度增加而增加。对于两种反应物，k3/k1比率都随表面密度增加而增加。

工业意义：在含有孤立单钒酸盐的催化剂上，在避免均相反应的最高可能反应温度下操作，可获得最高的烯烃产率。这一理解允许为烷烃转化过程设计更高效的工业催化剂。

虽然该文档主要关注负载型钒氧化物，没有提供关于金属交换沸石的信息，但催化剂组成、结构和反应条件如何影响性能的原理可能适用于其他金属基催化系统。
