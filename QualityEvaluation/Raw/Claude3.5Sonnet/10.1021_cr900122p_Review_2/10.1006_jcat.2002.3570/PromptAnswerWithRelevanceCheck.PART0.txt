[1] "Previous studies have shown that supported vanadia is the most active and selective simple metal oxide for alkane ODH, because its reducible nature leads to the rapid redox cycles required for a catalytic turnover (15)."

[2] "UVvisible spectroscopy suggests that V5+ is present in distorted tetrahedrally coordinated species at low vanadia surface densities and that some of these tetrahedrally coordinated cations remain at higher surface densities, coexisting with an increasing fraction of V5+ present in distorted tetragonal pyramidal coordination, similar to that present in V2O5 (25)."

[3] "For both ethane and propane reactants, these apparent turnover rates reach a maximum at intermediate vanadia surface densities. The maximum rate is reached at a surface VOx density of 8 V/nm2 for both reactants, and this maximum rate is about four times greater than that obtained on the VOx/Al2O3 sample with the lowest surface density (1.4 V/nm2)."

[4] "Ethane ODH at zero conversion is 75% selective to ethene and insensitive to vanadia surface density, while initial propene selectivities during propane ODH approach 90% at low vanadia surface densities, but decrease with increasing vanadia surface density."

[5] "Therefore, the highest olefin yields are obtained on catalysts containing isolated monovanadates and operated at the highest possible reaction temperature consistent with the avoidance of homogeneous reactions."

The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts, particularly supported vanadium oxides, significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations in oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) processes.

Composition: Supported vanadia is reported to be the most active and selective simple metal oxide for alkane ODH due to its reducible nature, which enables rapid redox cycles necessary for catalytic turnover.

Structure: The vanadia surface density plays a crucial role in catalyst performance. At low surface densities, V5+ is present in distorted tetrahedrally coordinated species. As surface density increases, these coexist with an increasing fraction of V5+ in distorted tetragonal pyramidal coordination, similar to V2O5. The catalyst structure evolves from isolated monovanadates to polyvanadates and eventually V2O5 crystallites as surface density increases.

Reaction conditions: Temperature is a key factor affecting catalyst performance. Higher temperatures generally lead to increased alkene selectivity, but must be balanced against the onset of undesired homogeneous reactions.

Efficiency: Turnover rates for both ethane and propane ODH reach a maximum at intermediate vanadia surface densities (around 8 V/nm2), with rates about four times higher than at the lowest surface density (1.4 V/nm2). This suggests that oligomeric VOx structures are more active than isolated species.

Selectivity: For ethane ODH, selectivity to ethene is about 75% and relatively insensitive to vanadia surface density. For propane ODH, initial propene selectivities approach 90% at low vanadia surface densities but decrease as surface density increases.

Industrial significance: The highest olefin yields are obtained on catalysts containing isolated monovanadates operated at high temperatures while avoiding homogeneous reactions. This insight can guide the design of more efficient industrial catalysts for alkane ODH processes.

The study does not provide information about zeolite-catalyzed reactions, so that part of the question cannot be addressed based on the given literature.

金属基催化剂的组成、结构和反应条件，特别是负载型钒氧化物，显著影响烷烃转化过程中的氧化脱氢（ODH）机理和效率。

组成：据报道，负载型钒是最活跃和选择性最高的简单金属氧化物，用于烷烃ODH，这是因为其可还原性能够实现快速氧化还原循环，这对催化周转至关重要。

结构：钒的表面密度在催化剂性能中起着关键作用。在低表面密度下，V5+以扭曲的四面体配位形式存在。随着表面密度增加，这些物种与越来越多的扭曲四方锥配位的V5+共存，类似于V2O5。随着表面密度增加，催化剂结构从孤立的单钒酸盐演变为多钒酸盐，最终形成V2O5晶体。

反应条件：温度是影响催化剂性能的关键因素。较高的温度通常会导致烯烃选择性增加，但必须权衡不希望出现的均相反应的开始。

效率：乙烷和丙烷ODH的周转速率在中等钒表面密度（约8 V/nm2）时达到最大值，其速率约为最低表面密度（1.4 V/nm2）时的四倍。这表明寡聚的VOx结构比孤立物种更活跃。

选择性：对于乙烷ODH，乙烯的选择性约为75%，对钒表面密度相对不敏感。对于丙烷ODH，在低钒表面密度下，初始丙烯选择性接近90%，但随着表面密度增加而降低。

工业意义：在高温下操作含有孤立单钒酸盐的催化剂，同时避免均相反应，可获得最高的烯烃产率。这一见解可以指导更高效的工业催化剂设计，用于烷烃ODH过程。

Composition: Supported vanadia is reported to be the most active and selective simple metal oxide for alkane ODH due to its reducible nature, which facilitates rapid redox cycles necessary for catalytic turnover.

Structure: The surface density of vanadium oxide (VOx) plays a crucial role in catalytic performance. At low surface densities, V5+ is present in distorted tetrahedrally coordinated species. As surface density increases, these coexist with an increasing fraction of V5+ in distorted tetragonal pyramidal coordination. The structure of VOx domains affects the acid-base properties of the catalyst surface, which in turn influences reaction rates and selectivity.

Reaction conditions: Temperature is a key factor. Higher temperatures generally lead to increased alkene selectivity, but must be balanced against the onset of undesired homogeneous reactions.

Efficiency: Apparent turnover rates for both ethane and propane ODH reach a maximum at intermediate vanadia surface densities (around 8 V/nm2), with rates about four times greater than those observed at the lowest surface density (1.4 V/nm2).

Mechanisms: The ratios of rate constants for different reaction pathways (k2/k1 and k3/k1) vary with vanadia surface density and reactant type, affecting product selectivity. For ethane, k2/k1 is independent of surface density, while for propane, it increases with increasing surface density. The k3/k1 ratio increases with surface density for both reactants.

Industrial significance: The highest olefin yields are obtained on catalysts containing isolated monovanadates operated at the highest possible reaction temperature that avoids homogeneous reactions. This understanding allows for the design of more efficient industrial catalysts for alkane transformation processes.

While the document focuses on supported vanadium oxides and does not provide information on metal-exchanged zeolites, the principles of how catalyst composition, structure, and reaction conditions affect performance are likely applicable to other metal-based catalytic systems as well.

The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of supported vanadium oxide catalysts significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations, particularly in oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) processes. 

Vanadium oxide supported on alumina (VOx/Al2O3) is highly active and selective for alkane ODH due to its reducible nature, which enables rapid redox cycles. The structure of the supported vanadium species changes with surface density, transitioning from isolated tetrahedral species at low densities to a mixture of tetrahedral and distorted tetragonal pyramidal structures at higher densities.

The efficiency of the catalysts, measured by turnover rates, reaches a maximum at intermediate vanadia surface densities (around 8 V/nm2) for both ethane and propane ODH. This optimal density provides a rate about four times higher than that of the lowest density catalyst.

Reaction conditions, particularly temperature, play a crucial role. While activation energies for ethane and propane dehydrogenation are similar and decrease slightly with increasing vanadia surface density, higher temperatures generally lead to increased olefin selectivity.

The industrial significance of these catalysts is tied to their ability to produce high olefin yields. The study suggests that the highest yields are obtained using catalysts with isolated monovanadate species operated at the highest possible temperature that avoids homogeneous reactions. This finding provides a clear direction for optimizing industrial processes using these catalysts.

The study does not provide information about metal-exchanged zeolites or zeolite-catalyzed reactions, focusing instead on supported vanadium oxide catalysts for ODH reactions.

支持的钒氧化物催化剂的组成、结构和反应条件显著影响烷烃转化的机理和效率，特别是在氧化脱氢(ODH)过程中。

由于其可还原性使其能够进行快速的氧化还原循环，氧化铝支持的钒氧化物(VOx/Al2O3)对烷烃ODH具有高活性和选择性。随着表面密度的变化，支持的钒物种的结构发生变化，从低密度下的孤立四面体物种过渡到高密度下四面体和扭曲四角锥结构的混合物。

催化剂的效率，以转化率衡量，在中等钒表面密度(约8 V/nm2)时达到最大值，这适用于乙烷和丙烷ODH。这种最佳密度提供的反应速率约为最低密度催化剂的四倍。

反应条件，特别是温度，起着至关重要的作用。虽然乙烷和丙烷脱氢的活化能相似，并且随着钒表面密度的增加略有下降，但更高的温度通常会导致烯烃选择性增加。

这些催化剂的工业重要性在于它们能够产生高烯烃收率。研究表明，使用含有孤立单钒酸盐物种的催化剂，在避免均相反应的情况下在尽可能高的温度下操作，可以获得最高的收率。这一发现为优化使用这些催化剂的工业过程提供了明确的方向。

The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of supported vanadium oxide catalysts significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) reactions. 

Supported vanadia is highly active and selective for alkane ODH due to its reducible nature, which enables rapid redox cycles. The local structure of supported VOx domains strongly affects reaction rates and selectivity. 

Catalyst composition, particularly the vanadia surface density, plays a crucial role. Both ethane and propane ODH show maximum turnover rates at intermediate vanadia surface densities (around 8 V/nm2). However, propane ODH rates are about eight times higher than ethane ODH rates at a given surface density.

The structure of the vanadia species also impacts catalytic performance. Isolated monovanadate species, predominant at low surface densities, show the highest initial alkene selectivity for both ethane and propane ODH. However, oligomeric VOx structures formed at higher surface densities exhibit higher reaction rates.

Reaction conditions, especially temperature, are important. Higher temperatures generally increase alkene selectivity. The optimal catalyst for maximizing alkene yield contains predominantly isolated monovanadate species and operates at high temperatures below the onset of homogeneous reactions (< 800 K).

These factors contribute to the industrial significance of supported vanadium oxide catalysts for alkane ODH by allowing for the tuning of activity and selectivity through careful control of catalyst composition, structure, and reaction conditions.

负载钒氧化物催化剂的组成、结构和反应条件显著影响烷烃氧化脱氢(ODH)反应的机理和效率。

由于其可还原性使其能够进行快速的氧化还原循环，负载钒是高活性和高选择性的烷烃ODH催化剂。负载VOx结构域的局部结构强烈影响反应速率和选择性。

催化剂组成，尤其是钒表面密度，起着至关重要的作用。乙烷和丙烷ODH在中等钒表面密度(约8 V/nm2)下均显示最大转化率。然而，在给定表面密度下，丙烷ODH速率约为乙烷ODH速率的8倍。

钒物种的结构也影响催化性能。在低表面密度下占主导地位的孤立单钒酸盐物种对乙烷和丙烷ODH均表现出最高的初始烯烃选择性。然而，在较高表面密度下形成的寡聚VOx结构表现出更高的反应速率。

反应条件，特别是温度，也很重要。通常，较高的温度会增加烯烃的选择性。最佳的催化剂应主要含有孤立的单钒酸盐物种，并在低于均相反应起始温度的高温下操作（< 800 K）。

这些因素通过允许通过仔细控制催化剂组成、结构和反应条件来调整活性和选择性，从而促进了负载钒氧化物催化剂在烷烃ODH工业应用中的重要性。

The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of supported vanadium oxide catalysts significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations in oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) processes:

1. Composition: VOx/Al2O3 catalysts are prepared by impregnating γ-alumina with ammonium metavanadate and oxalic acid solutions. The vanadia surface density greatly affects catalyst performance.

2. Structure: At low surface densities, isolated monovanadate species predominate. As density increases, two-dimensional polyvanadates form, followed by three-dimensional V2O5 crystallites. These structural changes impact catalytic activity and selectivity.

3. Reaction conditions: 
   - Temperature: Ethane ODH is conducted at 663-743 K, while propane ODH occurs at 603-663 K. Higher temperatures generally increase alkene selectivity.
   - Reactor design: A packed-bed flow reactor with plug-flow hydrodynamics is used, with catalyst dilution to prevent temperature gradients.

4. Catalytic performance:
   - Activity: Turnover rates for both ethane and propane ODH reach a maximum at intermediate vanadia surface densities (8 V/nm2).
   - Selectivity: Initial ethene selectivity is about 75% and relatively independent of surface density. Propene selectivity can reach 90% at low surface densities but decreases with increasing density.
   - The ratio of alkane combustion to dehydrogenation (k2/k1) is independent of surface density for ethane but increases with density for propane.

5. Optimal conditions: The highest olefin yields are obtained using catalysts with isolated monovanadates operated at the highest possible temperature without causing homogeneous reactions.

These factors contribute to the industrial significance of supported vanadium oxide catalysts for alkane ODH by allowing for the tuning of catalyst composition and reaction conditions to maximize desired product yields while minimizing unwanted side reactions.
