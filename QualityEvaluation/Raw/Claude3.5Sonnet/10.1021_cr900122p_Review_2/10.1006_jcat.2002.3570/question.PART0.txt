The catalytic properties of Al2O3-supported vanadia with a
wide range of VOx surface density (1.434.2 V/nm2) and structure
were examined for the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane and
propane. UVvisible and Raman spectra showed that vanadia is
dispersed predominately as isolated monovanadate species below
2.3 V/nm2. As surface densities increase, two-dimensional poly-
vanadates appear (2.37.0 V/nm2), along with increasing amounts
of V2O5 crystallites at surface densities above 7.0 V/nm2. The
rate constant for oxidative dehydrogenation (k1) and its ratio with
alkane and alkene combustion (k2/k1 and k3/k1, respectively) were
compared for both alkane reactants as a function of vanadia surface
density. Propene formation rates (per V atom) are approximately
eight times higher than ethene formation rates at a given reaction
temperature, but the apparent ODH activation energies (E1) are
similar for the two reactants and relatively insensitive to vanadia
surface density. Ethene and propene formation rates (per V atom)
are strongly influenced by vanadia surface density and reach a
maximum value at intermediate surface densities (8 V/nm2). The
ratio of k2/k1 depends weakly on reaction temperature, indicat-
ing that activation energies for alkane combustion and ODH re-
actions are similar. The ratio of k2/k1 is independent of surface
density for ethane but increases slightly with vanadia surface den-
sity for propane, suggesting that isolated structures prevalent at
low surface densities are slightly more selective for alkane de-
hydrogenation reactions. The ratio of k3/k1 decreases markedly
with increasing reaction temperature for both ethane and propane
ODH. Thus, the apparent activation energy for alkene combus-
tion (E3) is much lower than that for alkane dehydrogenation (E1)
and the difference between these two activation energies decreases
with increasing surface density. The lower alkene selectivities ob-
served at high vanadia surface densities are attributed to an in-
crease in alkene adsorption enthalpies with increasing vanadia
surface density. The highest yield of alkene is obtained for cata-
lysts containing predominantly isolated monovanadate species and
operated at high temperatures that avoid homogeneous reactions
(<800 K).

INTRODUCTION
Low-molecular-weight alkenes, such as ethene and
propene, can be formed via nonoxidative dehydrogena-
tion of the corresponding alkane. Nonoxidative dehydro-
genation reactions are endothermic and lead to the con-
current formation of carbon and of lower molecular weight
alkanes, both of which decrease alkene yields. Oxidative de-
hydrogenation (ODH) of light alkanes offers a potentially
attractive route to alkenes, since the reaction is exothermic
and avoids the thermodynamic constraints of nonoxidative
routes by forming water as a by-product. In addition, car-
bon deposition during ODH is eliminated, leading to stable
catalytic activity. However, the yield of alkenes obtained by
ODH on most catalysts is limited by alkene combustion to
CO and CO2 (COx).
Previous studies have shown that supported vanadia is
the most active and selective simple metal oxide for alkane
ODH, because its reducible nature leads to the rapid redox
cycles required for a catalytic turnover (15). Other stud-
ies (618) have probed the kinetics and selectivity of ethane
and propane ODH on VOx/Al2O3 and on VOx species sup-
portedonothermetaloxides.Thesestudieshaveshownthat
ODH rates per gram of catalyst and alkene selectivities are
higher on dispersed VOx than on V2O5. The local struc-
ture of supported VOx domains strongly influences ODH
reaction rates and selectivity (1214). The effects of oxide
domain size and of support on rates and selectivity have
been attributed to the acidbase properties of the VOx and
support surfaces (15, 718).
Alkane ODH reactions proceed via the reaction net-
work shown in Scheme 1 (4, 10, 1214, 19, 20), in which al-
kanes react with lattice oxygen to form alkenes, with a rate
constant k1, or COx, with a rate constant k2. The alkenes
formed undergo subsequent oxidation to COx with a rate
constant k3. Reaction rates are nearly zero order in O2
and show a weak inhibition by H2O formed in ODH re-
actions (14, 21). A pseudo-first-order kinetic analysis of
Scheme 1 is sufficiently accurate to provide all three rate
constants from rate and selectivity data as a function of

reactor residence time. High alkene yields at reasonable
residence times require high values of k1 and low values of
k2/k1 and k3/k1.
The effects of VOx surface density and structure on rates
and selectivities for ethane and propane ODH reactions
have been previously reported (718), with somewhat in-
consistent results. For example, for ethane ODH on VOx/γ -
Al2O3 catalysts, the vanadia surface density that produces
the highest ethane and ethene rates per V has been vari-
ously reported to occur at 33 (9), 50 (7), or 70% (2) of
the polyvanadate monolayer coverage. As another exam-
ple,thevariationofpropeneselectivitywithvanadiasurface
density over a range of 1.73.9 V/nm2 has been reported
to be insignificant (2, 17) and quite significant, varying by
20% (13), for propane ODH on VOx/γ -Al2O3 catalysts.
The lack of detailed structural characterization and rigor-
ous kinetic analysis of integral (high conversion) rate and
selectivity data, and the temperature gradients and possible
homogeneous reactions prevalent at the high temperatures
and conversions of many previous studies, have contributed
to the persistent controversies.
Here, we report a detailed kinetic analysis of ethane
ODH reactions on VOx/Al2O3 samples with a wide range
of VOx surface densities (1.434 VOx/nm2) and contrast
the results with those obtained using propane as the re-
actant. We have combined this analysis with detailed struc-
tural characterization of these catalysts in order to relate
their local structure to the values of the rate constants,
which characterize the function of these catalytic materi-
als. In addition, we contrast the reaction rates of ethane
and propane molecules with different CH bond ener-
gies and different adsorption energies of the respective
alkenes.
EXPERIMENTAL METHODS
VOx/Al2O3 catalysts were prepared by incipient wetness
impregnation of fumed γ -alumina (Degussa, AG, 100 m2/g)
with an aqueous solution of ammonium metavanadate
(99%, Aldrich, Inc.) and oxalic acid (Mallinckrodt analyti-
cal grade) in a 1 : 2 weight ratio (12) with a pH of 2. The
impregnated samples were dried in air at 398 K for 16 h,
crushed, treated in 1.67 cm3 s1 (STP) dry air (Airgas zero
grade) at 773 K for 3 h, and sieved to retain particles with
diameters of 180355 m.
Surface areas were measured by N2 physisorption (Air-
gas,99.999%)atitsnormalboilingpointusingaQuantasorb
surface area analyzer and standard multipoint BET analysis
methods. The catalyst samples were treated in flowing He
(Airgas, 99.999%) at 393 K for 2 h before N2 physisorption
measurements.
Diffuse reflectance UVvisible spectra were measured
with a VarianCary 4 spectrophotometer equipped with a
Harrickdiffusereflectanceattachment.Samplesweredehy-
drated in 20% O2/He (1.67 cm3 s1(STP), Praxair, 99.99%)
at 723 K before measuring spectra at ambient temperature
between 1 and 5 eV. The KubelkaMunk function (F(R))
was used to convert diffuse reflectance data into absorption
spectra using MgO as a standard (22). The absorption edge
energy was estimated from the x-intercept of a linear fit in
the near-edge region in a plot of (F(R)hν)1/2 as a function
of hν (22).
Raman spectra were obtained using a Hololab Se-
ries 5000 Raman spectrometer (Kaiser Optical) with a
frequency-doubled 75-mW Nd-YAG laser at a wavelength
of 532 nm. VOx/Al2O3 samples (0.05 g) were pressed into
wafers(0.9-cmdiameter, 0.1-cmthickness)at40MPaand
Raman spectra were measured at ambient temperatures
before and after dehydration treatments. Dehydration was
carried out at 723 K in flowing 20% O2 (Airgas, 99.99%) in
He (Scott Specialty Gases, Inc., 99.9999%) at a total flow
rate of 1.0 cm3 s1 (STP) for 0.75 h. A rotating Raman
cell (20 Hz) was used to prevent laser heating of the sam-
ples (23).
Reaction rate and selectivity data were measured in
a packed-bed flow reactor with plug-flow hydrodynam-
ics (24). VOx/Al2O3 catalysts (0.010.3 g) were diluted
with quartz granules (180- to 355-m diameter, 0.010.3 g)
in order to prevent bed temperature gradients. Reaction
measurements with Al2O3, quartz chips, or empty reac-
tors did not lead to detectable products in the tempera-
ture range of the study. Typical propane and O2 conversion
ranges on VOx/Al2O3 catalysts were 12 and 1020%, re-
spectively. A HewlettPackard 6890 gas chromatograph
equipped with packed (Supelco Carboxen 1004) and cap-
illary (HP-1, 50 m, 320 m) columns and thermal conduc-
tivity and flame ionization detectors was used to measure
the concentrations of reactants and products in the effluent
stream.
Ethane ODH reactions were examined at 663743 K,
while the faster propane ODH reactions were examined at
lower temperatures (603663 K). No homogeneous ethane
or propane reactions were detected below 800 K. Reac-
tor residence times were adjusted by varying reactant flow
rates between 0.083 and 4.2 cm3 s1 (STP). Reactant mix-
tures consisted of ethane (14 kPa, Scott Specialty Gases,
Inc., 99.999%) or propane (14 kPa, Airgas, 99.9%) with
O2 (1.7 kPa, Praxair, 99.999%) and He as an inert diluent
(Airgas, 99.9999%).

Conversion and selectivity were calculated from the mea-
sured GC compositions. These data were used to calculate
reaction rates from the reactant and product molar flow
rates. The reaction rates and selectivities as a function of
residence time were used to obtain initial alkane dehydro-
genation and combustion reaction rates and the rate con-
stants shown in Scheme 1. The sequence in Scheme 1 can be
used to obtain the k1 and k2 rate constants from the initial
alkene selectivity,

CxH2x = k1/(k1 + k2),
and k3 from the observed changes in alkene selectivity with
residence time,
SCxH2x = S0
CxH2x[1 (k1 + k2 + k3)CVτ/2],
where τ is residence time and CV is the concentration of V
atoms per reactor volume, as described in detail elsewhere
(12).
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Catalyst Characterization
BET surface areas and apparent VOx surface densities,
estimated from the V content and the BET surface areas,
are shown in Table 1 for all VOx/Al2O3 samples. Surface
areas (per gram of sample) decrease with increasing VOx
content. This trend corresponds to the low surface area of
the added VOx because the surface area normalized per
alumina content, listed in the last column of Table 1, is ap-
proximately constant. However, the 30 wt% sample shows
a decrease in surface area per gram of alumina, suggesting
that the formation of larger V2O5 crystallites blocks some
support pores.
The UVvisible spectra and the absorption edge ener-
gies for all VOx/Al2O3 samples are shown in Figs. 1a and
1b, respectively. VOx/Al2O3 samples with 8.0, 12.5, 16.6,
and 34.2 V/m2 exhibit two linear regions in the near-edge
region, indicating the presence of two distinct VOx struc-
tures. For those samples, two edge energies are measured

sity, approaching values typical of bulk V2O5 (2 eV) (25).
The edge energies based on the second linear portion of
the near-edge region are higher than those based on the
first linear portion and appear to be independent of the
vanadia surface density. Absorption edge energies above

that V5+ is present in distorted tetrahedrally coordinated
species at low vanadia surface densities and that some of
these tetrahedrally coordinated cations remain at higher
surface densities, coexisting with an increasing fraction of
V5+ presentindistortedtetragonalpyramidalcoordination,
similar to that present in V2O5 (25).
Raman spectra, obtained at ambient temperature after
treatment at 723 K in 20% O2/He, for the VOx/Al2O3 sam-
ples are shown in Fig. 2. V=O stretches in isolated tetra-
hedral monovanadates appear at 1033 cm1, while VOV
stretches in two-dimensional polyvanadates have been pro-
posed to lead to broad Raman features at 7501000 cm1
(2527). The remaining bands, appearing at 998, 706, 530,
489, 410, 305, 289, 203, and 150 cm1, correspond to bulk
V2O5 crystals(1,25).TheV2O5 bandsinsomeofthesespec-
tra are intense, but the Raman cross section for V2O5 crys-
tals is about 10 times larger than for monovanadate species
(23). Using this value, the ratio of V atoms in V2O5 to those
in monovanadate increases from 0 to 2.5 as VOx surface
densities increase from 1.4 to 34.2 V/nm2. Geometric cal-
culations, assuming flat, ordered support surfaces, predict
that a theoretical monolayer of monovanadate species oc-
curs at 2.3 V/nm2, and at 7.0 V/nm2 if polyvanadate species
are present (12, 28). Over this range of VOx surface densi-
ties, the ratio of V2O5 to monovanadate species increases
from 0.02 to 0.1. Thus, under either definition of a mono-
layer, most of the surface is covered by vanadate species
other than V2O5. Specifically, the V2O5 : monovandate ra-
tio increases from 0.085 for the catalyst with a vanadia sur-
face density of 3.6 V/nm2 to 0.115 for the catalyst with a
vanadia surface density of 8.0 V/nm2. This represents an in-
crease of 35% in the ratio of V2O5 to monovanadate species
atthesametimethatthevanadiaconcentrationdoubled,in-
dicating that the additional vanadia formed structures that
are neither isolated monovanadates nor V2O5 crystallites.
The V2O5 : monovandate ratio increases to 0.63, 1.6, and
2.5 for the catalysts with vanadia surface densities of 12.5,
16.6, and 32.4 V/nm2, which have vanadia concentrations
of 15, 20, and 30 wt%, respectively. The increase in the
V2O5:monovadate ratio is proportionally larger than the
additional vanadia content of these catalysts, suggesting
that all added vanadia forms V2O5 structures while simul-
taneously incorporating some monovanadates.
The spectroscopic results presented in Figs. 1 and 2 sug-
gest that distorted tetrahedral monovanadate structures
connected to the support via VOAl bonds are prevalent
at low surface densities. As V surface densities increase,
two-dimensional polyvanadates form via reactions leading
to VOV bonds connecting neighboring VOx species. VOx
species exceeding monolayer coverages react with poly-
vanadates structures to form three-dimensional structures

used to extrapolate rates and selectivity to zero reactor
residence time or reactant conversion and to estimate
the rates of secondary oxidation of C2H4. The decrease
in C2H6 conversion rates with increasing residence time
(Fig. 3a) reflects a slight inhibition of ethane dehydrogena-
tion rates by the water formed during reaction (21), as
reported previously for propane reactions (14, 29, 30). The
decreaseinetheneselectivitywithincreasingresidencetime
(Fig. 3b) arises from secondary ethene oxidation reactions
(Scheme 1). Data acquisition methods similar to those de-
scribed for ethane ODH were used to obtain the propane
ODH data. The conversion and selectivity trends displayed
in Fig. 3 for ethane ODH are similar to those observed
for propane ODH, as described in more detail elsewhere
(13, 14).
Figures 4a and 4b show the effect of vanadia surface den-
sity on the initial rate of alkene formation per V atom (ex-
trapolated to zero residence time). For both ethane and
propane reactants, these apparent turnover rates reach a
maximum at intermediate vanadia surface densities. The
maximum rate is reached at a surface VOx density of
8 V/nm2 for both reactants, and this maximum rate is
about four times greater than that obtained on the VOx/
Al2O3 sample with the lowest surface density (1.4 V/nm2).
Well-dispersed monovanadate species prevalent in the lat-
ter sample are significantly less active than the oligomeric
VOx structures that appear as the vanadia surface density
increases. The rate per V atom increases with surface densi-
ties, even though V atoms become increasingly unavailable
for catalysis as three-dimensional structures form. Thus, the
surface reactivity of VOx increases even more markedly
with surface density than is suggested by the data in Fig. 4.
ForagivenVOx surfacedensity,theapparentturnoverrates
for propane reactants is approximately eight times higher
than for ethane, but the effects of vanadia surface density
and the higher surface reactivity of the VOx oligomers are
observed for both alkane reactants.
Figures 4a and 4b show that apparent turnover rates for
both ethane and propane decrease at VOx surface densi-
ties above 8 V/nm2, as also found previously for propane
ODH on VOx/ZrO2 (31). These trends reflect the intro-
duction of additional vanadia species within the inaccessi-
ble bulk of three-dimensional structures. The picture of the
sample surfaces evolving from isolated and sparsely dis-
tributed monovanadates, to nearly complete polyvanadate
monolayers, followed by the gradual building of additional
layers would lead to low areal ODH rates at low surface
densities,becausemostofthesurfaceareaisinactiveAl2O3.
The increasing coverage of the Al2O3 with monovanadate
and with more reactive polyvanadates would increase the
measured areal rates, until the entire surface was covered

trends are confirmed by the areal rates of alkene formation
from ethane or propane, plotted as a function of vanadia
surface density in Figs. 5a and 5b. These areal rates in-
crease with increasing surface density and approach nearly
constant values for vanadia surface densities higher than
10 V/nm2, as also found for propane ODH on VOx/ZrO2
(31). The constant areal rate obtained after completion of

(7). The similar values of E1 of the two reactants is unex-
pected, because propane dehydrogenation is significantly
faster than ethane dehydrogenation. Since CH bond acti-
vation is the kinetically relevant step in dehydrogenation
of propane (14, 12, 14, 19, 29 30) and also ethane on
vanadia-based catalysts (19), and the methylene CH bonds
in propane are considerably weaker than the methyl CH
bonds in ethane (401 vs 420 kJ/mol), a lower activation
energy is expected for propane than for ethane dehydro-
genation reactions. Therefore, other factors must account
for the equivalence of the activation energies for ethane
and propane ODH. One of these factors may be the stabil-
ity of the alkyl radical formed upon CH bond activation. A
higher stabilization energy for ethoxide species relative to
isopropoxide species could compensate for the differences
in CH bond energies in the transition state involved in C
H bond activation and lead to similar activation energies
for the two alkane reactants.
Dehydrogenation rates are much lower for ethane than
for propane (Fig. 4) even though activation energies are
similar (Fig. 6). This means that either the number of ac-
tive sites or the preexponential factor must be much lower
for ethane than for propane reactants. It appears unlikely
that the mechanism or site requirements would differ for
two alkanes as similar as propane and ethane, which react
via similar redox mechanisms using lattice oxygen atoms
(15, 12, 14, 21, 29, 30). The lower preexponential factors
would then have to reflect a larger negative entropy of for-
mation of the transition state for ethane than for propane.
An analysis based on transition state theory and on the ex-
pected structures of activated complexes required for CH
bond activation, however, does not indicate that the acti-
vation entropy of ethane ODH is more negative than that
of propane ODH. These theoretical considerations suggest
thatactivationentropydifferencesdonotexplainthehigher
rate of propane ODH relative to ethane ODH.
Figure 7 illustrates the effect of VOx surface density on
alkene selectivities. The initial selectivity to ethene is 75%
for ethane ODH on VOx/Al2O3 and it does not change sig-
nificantly with increasing VOx surface density (Fig. 7a). CO
is the major by-product and only a small amount of CO2 is
formed. For propane ODH reactions, initial propene selec-
tivities are 85% at the lowest vanadia surface densities,
but they decrease to values similar to those for ethane re-
actants with increasing surface density (Fig. 7b).
The ratios of rate constants for alkane direct combus-
tion and dehydrogenation (k2/k1) are shown in Fig. 8 as
a function of VOx surface density. For ethane, k2/k1 is es-
sentially independent of VOx surface density, but this ratio
increases with increasing VOx surface density for propane
reactants. For ethane, k2/k1 is weakly dependent on temper-
ature, while for propane, k2/k1 is essentially independent of
temperature on all samples, indicating that the activation
energies for alkene and COx formation directly from al-
kanes (E1 and E2) are very similar (Fig. 9). The differences
between these two activation energies (E12 = E1E2) are
small, positive, and independent of VOx surface density for
ethane, but change from positive to negative with increas-
ing VOx surface density for propane ODH. These trends
are consistent with the observed trends in k2/k1 shown in
Fig. 8.
Figure 10 shows ratios of rate coefficients for alkene
combustion and alkane dehydrogenation (k3/k1). For both
reactants, k3/k1 increases with increasing VOx surface den-
sity and decreases with increasing temperature on all sam-
ples. This is consistent with a lower activation energy for
alkene reactions (E3) than for alkane reactions (E1). This

activationenergydifference(E13 = E1E3)decreasesfor
both alkanes with increasing VOx surface density (Fig. 11),
consistent with trends shown in Fig. 10. E1 values decrease
very slightly with increasing surface density; thus, the ob-
served changes in E13 arise almost exclusively from an
increase in the value of E3 with increasing VOx surface
density.
Changes in alkene adsorption enthalpies may account for
theobservedincreaseinalkenecombustionactivationener-
gies (E3) with increasing vanadia surface density. Theoreti-
cal estimates of enthalpies for ethene adsorption on sup-
ported polyvanadate monolayers (V2O5(001)/TiO2(001)
(anatase)) and bulk V2O5(001) surfaces (32) give values of
79.6 and 39.7 kJ/mol, respectively. These density func-
tional theory calculations are consistent with a higher acti-
vation energy on the bulk V2O5 surface, which binds ethene
much more weakly than two-dimensional VOx structures.
This is apparent from the definition of k3 as K3kact
3 , where
K3 is the equilibrium constant for ethene adsorption and
kact
3
is the rate constant for the activation of a CH bond
in ethene. Thus, the apparent activation energy is given by
H3 + Eact
3 , where H3 is the ethene adsorption enthalpy

is the activation energy for the kinetically relevant
CH bond activation step in adsorbed ethene (29). The en-
thalpy of adsorption of ethane is not very sensitive to VOx
surface structure (27.4 kJ/mol on V2O5(001)/TiO2 and
25.4 kJ/mol on V2O5(001) (32)). Taken together with the
nearly constant values of E1 (Fig. 6) on VOx/Al2O3 sam-
ples with a wide range of surface density, this suggests that
the energy for CH bond activation in ethane (Eact
1 ) is not
influenced by vanadia surface density. The mechanistic and
kinetic resemblance between CH bond activation steps in
alkanes and alkenes and the different observed sensitivities
of E1 and E3 on surface density suggest that only the ad-
sorption enthalpy of alkenes, not that of alkanes and not the
values of CH bond activation energies (Eact
1 , Eact
3 ), change
with VOx surface density.
The sample with the lowest vanadia surface density
(1.4 V/nm2) and containing predominately monovanadates
shows the highest initial alkene selectivity for both ethane
and propane ODH. Increasing vanadia surface density ei-
ther has no effect or decreases initial alkene selectivities.

The ratio of k2/k1 is independent of surface density for
ethane and increases with increasing vanadia surface den-
sity for propane (Fig. 8). The ratio of k3/k1 increases with in-
creasingvanadiasurfacedensityforbothreactants(Fig.10).
Smaller values of k3/k1 and k2/k1 lead to higher alkene se-
lectivity at all reactant conversion levels. As a result, the
1.4 V/nm2 catalyst is the most selective for both alkanes.
However, the alkene formation rates (per V atom) for the
1.4 V/nm2 catalyst are approximately four times lower at
a given reaction temperatures compared to the 8.0 V/nm2
catalyst (Fig. 4), but the rate difference can be overcome by
increasing reaction temperatures. The ratio of k2/k1 is rel-
atively independent of reaction temperature, and the value
of k3/k1 actually decreases with increasing temperature for
both reactants, leading to an increase in alkene selectivity
with increasing reaction temperature. Therefore, the alkene
yield can be maximized using a catalyst covered with dis-
persed monovanadate species, operated at high reaction
temperature. The maximum operating temperature is de-
termined by the onset of homogeneous reactions.
CONCLUSIONS
The rate and selectivity of ethane and propane ODH on
VOx/Al2O3 catalysts depend on the vanadia surface densi-
ties and reaction temperature. Ethane ODH at zero con-
version is 75% selective to ethene and insensitive to vana-
dia surface density, while initial propene selectivities during
propane ODH approach 90% at low vanadia surface den-
sities, but decrease with increasing vanadia surface density.
The ratio of k2/k1 is relatively independent of both reac-
tion temperature and vanadia surface density for ethane
ODH. The ratio of k2/k1 is independent of reaction temper-
ature, but increases with increasing vanadia surface density
for propane ODH. However, k3/k1 is generally higher for
propane than for ethane ODH, indicating that the propene
ismorereactiverelativetopropanethanetheneistoethane.
The activation energies for ethane and propane ODH, E1,
and ethane and propane combustion, E2, are similar in mag-
nitude at 115  20 kJ/mol and show weak dependence on
vanadia surface density. The propene formation rate is ap-
proximately eight times larger than the ethene formation
rate at 663 K, suggesting that that the stabilization energy
for ethoxide species may be higher relative to isopropox-
ide in the activated state. The apparent activation energy
for alkene combustion, E3, is 6090 kJ/mol and increases
with vanadia surface density, leading to a decrease in E13
with increasing vanadia surface density. The trends in E3
and E13 appear to be caused by decreasingly exother-
mic alkene adsorption as vanadia surface density increases.
Alkene selectivity generally increases with increasing reac-
tion temperature and with decreasing vanadia surface den-
sity. Therefore, the highest olefin yields are obtained on
catalysts containing isolated monovanadates and operated
at the highest possible reaction temperature consistent with
the avoidance of homogeneous reactions.
