[1] "Previous studies have shown that supported vanadia is the most active and selective simple metal oxide for alkane ODH, because its reducible nature leads to the rapid redox cycles required for a catalytic turnover"

[2] "The local structure of supported VOx domains strongly influences ODH reaction rates and selectivity"

[3] "For both ethane and propane reactants, these apparent turnover rates reach a maximum at intermediate vanadia surface densities. The maximum rate is reached at a surface VOx density of 8 V/nm2 for both reactants"

[4] "For a given VOx surface density, the apparent turnover rates for propane reactants is approximately eight times higher than for ethane, but the effects of vanadia surface density and the higher surface reactivity of the VOx oligomers are observed for both alkane reactants."

[5] "The highest yield of alkene is obtained for catalysts containing predominantly isolated monovanadate species and operated at high temperatures that avoid homogeneous reactions (<800 K)."

The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of supported vanadium oxide catalysts significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) reactions. 

Supported vanadia is highly active and selective for alkane ODH due to its reducible nature, which enables rapid redox cycles. The local structure of supported VOx domains strongly affects reaction rates and selectivity. 

Catalyst composition, particularly the vanadia surface density, plays a crucial role. Both ethane and propane ODH show maximum turnover rates at intermediate vanadia surface densities (around 8 V/nm2). However, propane ODH rates are about eight times higher than ethane ODH rates at a given surface density.

The structure of the vanadia species also impacts catalytic performance. Isolated monovanadate species, predominant at low surface densities, show the highest initial alkene selectivity for both ethane and propane ODH. However, oligomeric VOx structures formed at higher surface densities exhibit higher reaction rates.

Reaction conditions, especially temperature, are important. Higher temperatures generally increase alkene selectivity. The optimal catalyst for maximizing alkene yield contains predominantly isolated monovanadate species and operates at high temperatures below the onset of homogeneous reactions (< 800 K).

These factors contribute to the industrial significance of supported vanadium oxide catalysts for alkane ODH by allowing for the tuning of activity and selectivity through careful control of catalyst composition, structure, and reaction conditions.

负载钒氧化物催化剂的组成、结构和反应条件显著影响烷烃氧化脱氢(ODH)反应的机理和效率。

由于其可还原性使其能够进行快速的氧化还原循环，负载钒是高活性和高选择性的烷烃ODH催化剂。负载VOx结构域的局部结构强烈影响反应速率和选择性。

催化剂组成，尤其是钒表面密度，起着至关重要的作用。乙烷和丙烷ODH在中等钒表面密度(约8 V/nm2)下均显示最大转化率。然而，在给定表面密度下，丙烷ODH速率约为乙烷ODH速率的8倍。

钒物种的结构也影响催化性能。在低表面密度下占主导地位的孤立单钒酸盐物种对乙烷和丙烷ODH均表现出最高的初始烯烃选择性。然而，在较高表面密度下形成的寡聚VOx结构表现出更高的反应速率。

反应条件，特别是温度，也很重要。通常，较高的温度会增加烯烃的选择性。最佳的催化剂应主要含有孤立的单钒酸盐物种，并在低于均相反应起始温度的高温下操作（< 800 K）。

这些因素通过允许通过仔细控制催化剂组成、结构和反应条件来调整活性和选择性，从而促进了负载钒氧化物催化剂在烷烃ODH工业应用中的重要性。
