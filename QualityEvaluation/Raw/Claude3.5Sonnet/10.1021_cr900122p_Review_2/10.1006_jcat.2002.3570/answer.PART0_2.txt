[1] "Previous studies have shown that supported vanadia is the most active and selective simple metal oxide for alkane ODH, because its reducible nature leads to the rapid redox cycles required for a catalytic turnover (15)."

[2] "UVvisible spectroscopy suggests that V5+ is present in distorted tetrahedrally coordinated species at low vanadia surface densities and that some of these tetrahedrally coordinated cations remain at higher surface densities, coexisting with an increasing fraction of V5+ present in distorted tetragonal pyramidal coordination, similar to that present in V2O5 (25)."

[3] "For both ethane and propane reactants, these apparent turnover rates reach a maximum at intermediate vanadia surface densities. The maximum rate is reached at a surface VOx density of 8 V/nm2 for both reactants, and this maximum rate is about four times greater than that obtained on the VOx/Al2O3 sample with the lowest surface density (1.4 V/nm2)."

[4] "Ethane and propane dehydrogenation show similar activation energies, and the value decreases slightly for both reactants with increasing VOx surface density."

[5] "The highest olefin yields are obtained on catalysts containing isolated monovanadates and operated at the highest possible reaction temperature consistent with the avoidance of homogeneous reactions."

The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of supported vanadium oxide catalysts significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations, particularly in oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) processes. 

Vanadium oxide supported on alumina (VOx/Al2O3) is highly active and selective for alkane ODH due to its reducible nature, which enables rapid redox cycles. The structure of the supported vanadium species changes with surface density, transitioning from isolated tetrahedral species at low densities to a mixture of tetrahedral and distorted tetragonal pyramidal structures at higher densities.

The efficiency of the catalysts, measured by turnover rates, reaches a maximum at intermediate vanadia surface densities (around 8 V/nm2) for both ethane and propane ODH. This optimal density provides a rate about four times higher than that of the lowest density catalyst.

Reaction conditions, particularly temperature, play a crucial role. While activation energies for ethane and propane dehydrogenation are similar and decrease slightly with increasing vanadia surface density, higher temperatures generally lead to increased olefin selectivity.

The industrial significance of these catalysts is tied to their ability to produce high olefin yields. The study suggests that the highest yields are obtained using catalysts with isolated monovanadate species operated at the highest possible temperature that avoids homogeneous reactions. This finding provides a clear direction for optimizing industrial processes using these catalysts.

The study does not provide information about metal-exchanged zeolites or zeolite-catalyzed reactions, focusing instead on supported vanadium oxide catalysts for ODH reactions.

支持的钒氧化物催化剂的组成、结构和反应条件显著影响烷烃转化的机理和效率，特别是在氧化脱氢(ODH)过程中。

由于其可还原性使其能够进行快速的氧化还原循环，氧化铝支持的钒氧化物(VOx/Al2O3)对烷烃ODH具有高活性和选择性。随着表面密度的变化，支持的钒物种的结构发生变化，从低密度下的孤立四面体物种过渡到高密度下四面体和扭曲四角锥结构的混合物。

催化剂的效率，以转化率衡量，在中等钒表面密度(约8 V/nm2)时达到最大值，这适用于乙烷和丙烷ODH。这种最佳密度提供的反应速率约为最低密度催化剂的四倍。

反应条件，特别是温度，起着至关重要的作用。虽然乙烷和丙烷脱氢的活化能相似，并且随着钒表面密度的增加略有下降，但更高的温度通常会导致烯烃选择性增加。

这些催化剂的工业重要性在于它们能够产生高烯烃收率。研究表明，使用含有孤立单钒酸盐物种的催化剂，在避免均相反应的情况下在尽可能高的温度下操作，可以获得最高的收率。这一发现为优化使用这些催化剂的工业过程提供了明确的方向。

该研究没有提供关于金属交换沸石或沸石催化反应的信息，而是专注于支持的钒氧化物催化剂用于ODH反应。
