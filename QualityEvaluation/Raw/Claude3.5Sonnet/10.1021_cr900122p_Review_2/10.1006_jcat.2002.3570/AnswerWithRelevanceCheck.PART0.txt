          [1] "Previous studies have shown that supported vanadia is the most active and selective simple metal oxide for alkane ODH, because its reducible nature leads to the rapid redox cycles required for a catalytic turnover (15)."

[2] "UVvisible spectroscopy suggests that V5+ is present in distorted tetrahedrally coordinated species at low vanadia surface densities and that some of these tetrahedrally coordinated cations remain at higher surface densities, coexisting with an increasing fraction of V5+ present in distorted tetragonal pyramidal coordination, similar to that present in V2O5 (25)."

[3] "For both ethane and propane reactants, these apparent turnover rates reach a maximum at intermediate vanadia surface densities. The maximum rate is reached at a surface VOx density of 8 V/nm2 for both reactants, and this maximum rate is about four times greater than that obtained on the VOx/Al2O3 sample with the lowest surface density (1.4 V/nm2)."

[4] "Ethane ODH at zero conversion is 75% selective to ethene and insensitive to vanadia surface density, while initial propene selectivities during propane ODH approach 90% at low vanadia surface densities, but decrease with increasing vanadia surface density."

[5] "Therefore, the highest olefin yields are obtained on catalysts containing isolated monovanadates and operated at the highest possible reaction temperature consistent with the avoidance of homogeneous reactions."

[6] "VOx/Al2O3 catalysts were prepared by incipient wetness impregnation of fumed γ-alumina (Degussa, AG, 100 m2/g) with an aqueous solution of ammonium metavanadate (99%, Aldrich, Inc.) and oxalic acid (Mallinckrodt analytical grade) in a 1 : 2 weight ratio (12) with a pH of 2."

[7] "Reaction rate and selectivity data were measured in a packed-bed flow reactor with plug-flow hydrodynamics (24). VOx/Al2O3 catalysts (0.010.3 g) were diluted with quartz granules (180- to 355-m diameter, 0.010.3 g) in order to prevent bed temperature gradients."

[8] "Ethane ODH reactions were examined at 663743 K, while the faster propane ODH reactions were examined at lower temperatures (603663 K)."

          The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts, particularly supported vanadium oxides, significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations in oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) processes:

1. Composition: VOx/Al2O3 catalysts are prepared by impregnating γ-alumina with ammonium metavanadate and oxalic acid solutions. The vanadia surface density greatly affects catalyst performance.

2. Structure: At low surface densities, V5+ is present in distorted tetrahedrally coordinated species. As density increases, these coexist with an increasing fraction of V5+ in distorted tetragonal pyramidal coordination, similar to V2O5. The catalyst structure evolves from isolated monovanadates to polyvanadates and eventually V2O5 crystallites as surface density increases.

3. Reaction conditions: 
   - Temperature: Ethane ODH is conducted at 663-743 K, while propane ODH occurs at 603-663 K. Higher temperatures generally increase alkene selectivity.
   - Reactor design: A packed-bed flow reactor with plug-flow hydrodynamics is used, with catalyst dilution to prevent temperature gradients.

4. Catalytic performance:
   - Activity: Turnover rates for both ethane and propane ODH reach a maximum at intermediate vanadia surface densities (8 V/nm2), about four times higher than at the lowest density (1.4 V/nm2).
   - Selectivity: Initial ethene selectivity is about 75% and relatively independent of surface density. Propene selectivity can reach 90% at low surface densities but decreases with increasing density.

5. Industrial significance: The highest olefin yields are obtained on catalysts containing isolated monovanadates operated at the highest possible reaction temperature that avoids homogeneous reactions. This insight can guide the design of more efficient industrial catalysts for alkane ODH processes.

These factors contribute to the industrial importance of supported vanadium oxide catalysts for alkane ODH by allowing for the optimization of catalyst composition, structure, and reaction conditions to maximize desired product yields while minimizing unwanted side reactions.

The study does not provide information about metal-exchanged zeolites or zeolite-catalyzed reactions, so that part of the question cannot be addressed based on the given literature.

          金属基催化剂的组成、结构和反应条件，特别是负载型钒氧化物，显著影响烷烃在氧化脱氢（ODH）过程中的转化机理和效率：

1. 组成：VOx/Al2O3催化剂是通过将γ-氧化铝浸渍于偏钒酸铵和草酸溶液中制备的。钒的表面密度极大地影响催化剂的性能。

2. 结构：在低表面密度下，V5+以扭曲的四面体配位形式存在。随着密度增加，这些物种与越来越多的扭曲四方锥配位的V5+共存，类似于V2O5。随着表面密度增加，催化剂结构从孤立的单钒酸盐演变为多钒酸盐，最终形成V2O5晶体。

3. 反应条件：
   - 温度：乙烷ODH在663-743 K下进行，而丙烷ODH在603-663 K下进行。较高的温度通常会增加烯烃的选择性。
   - 反应器设计：使用具有塞流流体动力学的填充床流动反应器，并稀释催化剂以防止温度梯度。

4. 催化性能：
   - 活性：乙烷和丙烷ODH的转化率在中等钒表面密度（8 V/nm2）时达到最大值，约为最低密度（1.4 V/nm2）时的四倍。
   - 选择性：初始乙烯选择性约为75%，与表面密度关系不大。丙烯选择性在低表面密度时可达90%，但随着密度增加而下降。

5. 工业意义：在含有孤立单钒酸盐的催化剂上，在避免均相反应的最高可能反应温度下操作，可获得最高的烯烃产率。这一见解可以指导更高效的工业催化剂设计，用于烷烃ODH过程。

这些因素通过允许优化催化剂组成、结构和反应条件以最大化所需产品产率，同时最小化不需要的副反应，从而为烷烃ODH的支持钒氧化物催化剂的工业重要性做出贡献。
