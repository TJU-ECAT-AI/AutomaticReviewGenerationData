[1] "Depending on the vanadium loadings, different vanadium oxide species (V5+) were formed on the surface of alumina after calcination. Mainly isolated and polymerized VO4 units were observed at coverages up to a monolayer [1,5,13] while VO6 octahedra were predominant on catalyst surfaces at higher vanadium loadings [1]."

[2] "The molecular structure of the surface vanadium oxide species and the catalytic properties are influenced by the method of preparation, the nature of support, promotors and environmental conditions [1]."

[3] "It is suggested that both isolated and polymerized tetrahedrally coordinated V5+ species are active in propane dehydrogenation. The AlVO4 phase and bulk-like V2O5 have only a low catalytic activity."

[4] "The highest propene selectivity was obtained for the sample with the highest dispersion of the isolated and polymerized tetrahedrally coordinated V5+ species."

[5] "Propene selectivity depends on the dispersion of the tetrahedrally coordinated V5+ species; the higher the dispersion, the higher the propene selectivity. CO is the main product of propene oxidation and its formation increases with decreasing dispersion of active sites."

The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of supported vanadium oxide catalysts significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations, particularly in oxidative dehydrogenation processes. 

The vanadium loading affects the types of vanadium oxide species formed on the alumina surface after calcination. At lower coverages, isolated and polymerized VO4 units are predominant, while at higher loadings, VO6 octahedra become more prevalent. 

The preparation method, nature of the support, promoters, and environmental conditions all influence the molecular structure of the surface vanadium oxide species and their catalytic properties.

For propane dehydrogenation, both isolated and polymerized tetrahedrally coordinated V5+ species are suggested to be active catalytic sites. In contrast, the AlVO4 phase and bulk-like V2O5 show low catalytic activity.

The dispersion of the tetrahedrally coordinated V5+ species plays a crucial role in determining propene selectivity. Higher dispersion leads to higher propene selectivity. However, as the dispersion of active sites decreases, the formation of CO (the main byproduct of propene oxidation) increases.

These factors contribute to the industrial significance of supported vanadium oxide catalysts by influencing their activity, selectivity, and overall efficiency in alkane transformation processes. Understanding and controlling these parameters allows for the design of more effective catalysts for industrial applications.

负载型钒氧化物催化剂的组成、结构和反应条件显著影响烷烃转化的机理和效率，特别是在氧化脱氢过程中。

钒负载量影响焙烧后在氧化铝表面形成的钒氧化物物种类型。在较低覆盖度下，以孤立和聚合的VO4单元为主，而在较高负载量下，VO6八面体变得更加普遍。

制备方法、载体性质、助剂和环境条件都会影响表面钒氧化物物种的分子结构及其催化性能。

对于丙烷脱氢，孤立和聚合的四面体配位V5+物种被认为是活性催化位点。相比之下，AlVO4相和类似体相的V2O5显示出较低的催化活性。

四面体配位V5+物种的分散度在决定丙烯选择性方面起着关键作用。更高的分散度导致更高的丙烯选择性。然而，随着活性位点分散度的降低，CO（丙烯氧化的主要副产品）的形成增加。

这些因素通过影响烷烃转化过程中的活性、选择性和整体效率，为负载型钒氧化物催化剂的工业重要性做出贡献。理解和控制这些参数可以设计出更有效的工业应用催化剂。
