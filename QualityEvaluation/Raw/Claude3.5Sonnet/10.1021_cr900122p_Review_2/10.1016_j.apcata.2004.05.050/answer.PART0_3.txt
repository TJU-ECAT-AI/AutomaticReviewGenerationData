[1] "Vanadium species formed on the alumina support after calcination between 773 and 973 K at vanadium loadings between 4.45 and 13.2 wt.% were characterized with different methods (51V NMR, ESR, H2-TPR and in situ UVvis-DRS) and tested in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane."

[2] "By calcination at 873 K, beside dispersed isolated and polymerized V5+ surface species mainly in tetrahedral coordination, a crystalline AlVO4 phase was formed. The portion of vanadium present as AlVO4 increases with increasing vanadium loadings (e.g. about 60 at 13.2 wt.%)."

[3] "It is suggested that both isolated and polymerized tetrahedrally coordinated V5+ species are active in propane dehydrogenation. The AlVO4 phase and bulk-like V2O5 have only a low catalytic activity."

[4] "The highest propene selectivity was obtained for the sample with the highest dispersion of the isolated and polymerized tetrahedrally coordinated V5+ species."

[5] "Initial propane reaction rate (Table 5) has the highest values for the samples V(8.9/773), V(4.5/873) and V(8.9/873). In these samples, dispersed isolated and polymerized tetrahedrally coordinated V5+ species dominate."

[6] "Propene selectivity depends on the dispersion of the tetrahedrally coordinated V5+ species; the higher the dispersion, the higher the propene selectivity. CO is the main product of propene oxidation and its formation increases with decreasing dispersion of active sites."

The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of supported vanadium oxide catalysts significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations, particularly in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane. 

Vanadium loading and calcination temperature are key factors affecting catalyst structure and performance. At vanadium loadings between 4.45 and 13.2 wt% and calcination temperatures of 773-973 K, different vanadium species form on the alumina support. These include dispersed isolated and polymerized V5+ surface species (mainly in tetrahedral coordination) and a crystalline AlVO4 phase. The portion of AlVO4 increases with higher vanadium loadings.

Both isolated and polymerized tetrahedrally coordinated V5+ species are active in propane dehydrogenation, while the AlVO4 phase and bulk-like V2O5 have low catalytic activity. The highest propene selectivity is achieved with the highest dispersion of isolated and polymerized tetrahedrally coordinated V5+ species.

Initial propane reaction rates are highest for samples with dominant dispersed isolated and polymerized tetrahedrally coordinated V5+ species. Propene selectivity depends on the dispersion of these active species - higher dispersion leads to higher selectivity. CO is the main byproduct, with its formation increasing as active site dispersion decreases.

These factors contribute to the industrial significance of supported vanadium oxide catalysts for alkane transformations by allowing control over activity and selectivity through catalyst composition and preparation methods. Optimizing the dispersion and coordination of active vanadium species is crucial for achieving high propene yields in oxidative dehydrogenation processes.

负载型钒氧化物催化剂的组成、结构和反应条件显著影响烷烃转化的机理和效率，特别是在丙烷的氧化脱氢过程中。

钒负载量和煅烧温度是影响催化剂结构和性能的关键因素。在4.45至13.2 wt%的钒负载量和773-973 K的煅烧温度下，不同的钒物种在氧化铝载体上形成。这些包括分散的孤立和聚合的V5+表面物种（主要以四面体配位）和结晶的AlVO4相。随着钒负载量的增加，AlVO4的比例增加。

四面体配位的孤立和聚合V5+物种都在丙烷脱氢中具有活性，而AlVO4相和类似体相的V2O5活性较低。四面体配位的孤立和聚合V5+物种分散度最高时，可获得最高的丙烯选择性。

分散的孤立和聚合四面体配位V5+物种占主导地位的样品具有最高的初始丙烷反应速率。丙烯选择性取决于这些活性物种的分散度 - 分散度越高，选择性越高。CO是主要副产物，随着活性位点分散度的降低，其形成量增加。

这些因素通过允许通过催化剂组成和制备方法控制活性和选择性，对负载型钒氧化物催化剂在烷烃转化中的工业重要性做出了贡献。优化活性钒物种的分散度和配位是在氧化脱氢过程中获得高丙烯产率的关键。
