[1] "Depending on the vanadium loadings, different vanadium oxide species (V5+) were formed on the surface of alumina after calcination. Mainly isolated and polymerized VO4 units were observed at coverages up to a monolayer [1,5,13] while VO6 octahedra were predominant on catalyst surfaces at higher vanadium loadings [1]."

[2] "Nature of vanadium species on alumina depends not only on vanadium loadings but also on calcination temperature. After calcination of V(4.5 wt.%)/Al2O3 at 873 K dispersed isolated and polymerized V5+ species in tetrahedral coordination dominate, with the later being the main species."

[3] "The catalytic activity for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane is determined by the amount of dispersed isolated and polymerised tetrahedrally coordinated V5+ species. It is concluded that the AlVO4 phase has only a low catalytic activity since an increase of their amount leads to a decrease of catalytic activity."

[4] "Propene selectivity depends on the dispersion of the tetrahedrally coordinated V5+ species; the higher the dispersion, the higher the propene selectivity. CO is the main product of propene oxidation and its formation increases with decreasing dispersion of active sites."

The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of supported vanadium oxide catalysts significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations, particularly in oxidative dehydrogenation processes:

1. Vanadium loading affects the species formed on the alumina surface after calcination. At low coverages, isolated and polymerized VO4 units dominate, while at higher loadings, VO6 octahedra become predominant.

2. Calcination temperature also impacts the nature of vanadium species. For example, at 873 K with 4.5 wt% vanadium loading, dispersed isolated and polymerized V5+ species in tetrahedral coordination are the main species formed.

3. The catalytic activity for propane oxidative dehydrogenation is determined by the amount of dispersed isolated and polymerized tetrahedrally coordinated V5+ species. The AlVO4 phase has low catalytic activity.

4. Propene selectivity is influenced by the dispersion of tetrahedrally coordinated V5+ species. Higher dispersion leads to higher propene selectivity. CO formation, the main byproduct, increases with decreasing dispersion of active sites.

These factors contribute to the industrial significance of supported vanadium oxide catalysts by affecting their activity, selectivity, and overall performance in alkane transformation processes.

负载型钒氧化物催化剂的组成、结构和反应条件显著影响烷烃转化的机理和效率，特别是在氧化脱氢过程中：

1. 钒负载量影响焙烧后在氧化铝表面形成的物种。在低覆盖率下，主要是分离的和聚合的VO4单元，而在高负载量下，VO6八面体成为主要物种。

2. 焙烧温度也影响钒物种的性质。例如，在873 K下，4.5 wt%钒负载量形成的主要物种是分散的分离和聚合的四面体配位V5+物种。

3. 丙烷氧化脱氢的催化活性由分散的分离和聚合的四面体配位V5+物种的数量决定。AlVO4相的催化活性较低。

4. 丙烯选择性受四面体配位V5+物种分散度的影响。分散度越高，丙烯选择性越高。CO的形成是主要副产物，随着活性位点分散度的降低而增加。

这些因素通过影响负载型钒氧化物催化剂在烷烃转化过程中的活性、选择性和整体性能，对其工业重要性产生影响。
