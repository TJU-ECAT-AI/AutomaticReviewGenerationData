[1] "Vanadium species formed on the alumina support after calcination between 773 and 973 K at vanadium loadings between 4.45 and 13.2 wt.% were characterized with different methods (51V NMR, ESR, H2-TPR and in situ UVvis-DRS) and tested in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane."

[2] "By calcination at 873 K, beside dispersed isolated and polymerized V5+ surface species mainly in tetrahedral coordination, a crystalline AlVO4 phase was formed."

[3] "It is suggested that both isolated and polymerized tetrahedrally coordinated V5+ species are active in propane dehydrogenation. The AlVO4 phase and bulk-like V2O5 have only a low catalytic activity."

[4] "The highest propene selectivity was obtained for the sample with the highest dispersion of the isolated and polymerized tetrahedrally coordinated V5+ species."

[5] "Nature of vanadium species on alumina depends not only on vanadium loadings but also on calcination temperature."

[6] "Propene selectivity depends on the dispersion of the tetrahedrally coordinated V5+ species; the higher the dispersion, the higher the propene selectivity."

The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of supported vanadium oxide catalysts significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations, particularly in oxidative dehydrogenation processes. Key factors include:

1. Vanadium loading: Higher loadings (4.45-13.2 wt%) lead to changes in the nature of vanadium species formed on the alumina support.

2. Calcination temperature: Temperatures between 773-973 K affect the formation and distribution of different vanadium species.

3. Vanadium species: Isolated and polymerized V5+ surface species in tetrahedral coordination are active for propane dehydrogenation, while AlVO4 phase and bulk-like V2O5 have low catalytic activity.

4. Dispersion: Higher dispersion of isolated and polymerized tetrahedrally coordinated V5+ species leads to higher propene selectivity.

5. Reaction conditions: Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane was used as a test reaction to evaluate catalyst performance.

These factors contribute to the industrial significance of supported vanadium oxide catalysts by influencing their activity, selectivity, and overall efficiency in alkane transformation processes. The ability to control and optimize these parameters allows for the development of more effective catalysts for industrial applications.

负载型钒氧化物催化剂的组成、结构和反应条件显著影响烷烃转化的机理和效率，特别是在氧化脱氢过程中。关键因素包括：

1. 钒负载量：较高的负载量（4.45-13.2 wt%）导致在氧化铝载体上形成的钒物种性质发生变化。

2. 焙烧温度：773-973 K之间的温度影响不同钒物种的形成和分布。

3. 钒物种：四面体配位的孤立和聚合V5+表面物种对丙烷脱氢具有活性，而AlVO4相和类块状V2O5具有较低的催化活性。

4. 分散度：四面体配位的孤立和聚合V5+物种的分散度越高，丙烯选择性越高。

5. 反应条件：使用丙烷的氧化脱氢作为测试反应来评估催化剂性能。

这些因素通过影响催化剂在烷烃转化过程中的活性、选择性和整体效率，促进了负载型钒氧化物催化剂的工业重要性。能够控制和优化这些参数允许开发出更有效的工业应用催化剂。
