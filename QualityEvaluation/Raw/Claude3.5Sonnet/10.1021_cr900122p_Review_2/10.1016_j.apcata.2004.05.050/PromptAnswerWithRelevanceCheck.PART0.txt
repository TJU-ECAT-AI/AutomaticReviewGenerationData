[1] "Depending on the vanadium loadings, different vanadium oxide species (V5+) were formed on the surface of alumina after calcination. Mainly isolated and polymerized VO4 units were observed at coverages up to a monolayer [1,5,13] while VO6 octahedra were predominant on catalyst surfaces at higher vanadium loadings [1]."

[2] "The molecular structure of the surface vanadium oxide species and the catalytic properties are influenced by the method of preparation, the nature of support, promotors and environmental conditions [1]."

[3] "It is suggested that both isolated and polymerized tetrahedrally coordinated V5+ species are active in propane dehydrogenation. The AlVO4 phase and bulk-like V2O5 have only a low catalytic activity."

[4] "The highest propene selectivity was obtained for the sample with the highest dispersion of the isolated and polymerized tetrahedrally coordinated V5+ species."

[5] "Propene selectivity depends on the dispersion of the tetrahedrally coordinated V5+ species; the higher the dispersion, the higher the propene selectivity. CO is the main product of propene oxidation and its formation increases with decreasing dispersion of active sites."

The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of supported vanadium oxide catalysts significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations, particularly in oxidative dehydrogenation processes. 

The vanadium loading affects the species formed on the alumina surface after calcination. At lower coverages, isolated and polymerized VO4 units dominate, while at higher loadings, VO6 octahedra become predominant. The preparation method, nature of the support, promoters, and environmental conditions all impact the molecular structure of surface vanadium oxide species and their catalytic properties.

In propane dehydrogenation, both isolated and polymerized tetrahedrally coordinated V5+ species are suggested to be active sites. The AlVO4 phase and bulk-like V2O5 show low catalytic activity. The dispersion of these active species plays a crucial role in determining catalyst performance.

Higher dispersion of isolated and polymerized tetrahedrally coordinated V5+ species leads to higher propene selectivity. As dispersion decreases, CO formation increases as a result of propene oxidation. This relationship between dispersion and selectivity is a key factor in optimizing catalyst performance for industrial applications.

The study does not provide information on zeolite-catalyzed reactions or the industrial significance of these catalysts. However, the insights into the structure-activity relationships of supported vanadium oxide catalysts contribute to understanding how to design more efficient catalysts for alkane transformations in industrial processes.

金属基催化剂的组成、结构和反应条件，特别是负载型钒氧化物催化剂，对烷烃转化的机理和效率有显著影响，尤其是在氧化脱氢过程中。

钒负载量影响氧化铝表面钒物种的形成。在低覆盖度下，以孤立和聚合的VO4单元为主，而在高负载量下，VO6八面体结构占主导地位。制备方法、载体性质、助剂和环境条件都会影响表面钒氧化物的分子结构和催化性能。

在丙烷脱氢反应中，四面体配位的孤立和聚合V5+物种被认为是活性位点。AlVO4相和类块状V2O5显示出较低的催化活性。这些活性物种的分散度对催化剂性能起着关键作用。

四面体配位的孤立和聚合V5+物种分散度越高，丙烯选择性越高。随着分散度降低，丙烯氧化生成CO的量增加。这种分散度与选择性之间的关系是优化工业应用催化剂性能的关键因素。

该研究没有提供关于沸石催化反应或这些催化剂工业重要性的信息。然而，对负载型钒氧化物催化剂的结构-活性关系的深入了解，有助于理解如何设计更高效的催化剂用于工业过程中的烷烃转化。

For propane dehydrogenation, both isolated and polymerized tetrahedrally coordinated V5+ species are suggested to be active catalytic sites. In contrast, the AlVO4 phase and bulk-like V2O5 show low catalytic activity.

The dispersion of the tetrahedrally coordinated V5+ species plays a crucial role in determining propene selectivity. Higher dispersion leads to higher propene selectivity. However, as the dispersion of active sites decreases, the formation of CO (the main byproduct of propene oxidation) increases.

The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of supported vanadium oxide catalysts significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations, particularly in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane. 

Vanadium loading and calcination temperature are key factors affecting catalyst structure and performance. At vanadium loadings between 4.45 and 13.2 wt% and calcination temperatures of 773-973 K, different vanadium species form on the alumina support. These include dispersed isolated and polymerized V5+ surface species (mainly in tetrahedral coordination) and a crystalline AlVO4 phase. The portion of AlVO4 increases with higher vanadium loadings.

Both isolated and polymerized tetrahedrally coordinated V5+ species are active in propane dehydrogenation, while the AlVO4 phase and bulk-like V2O5 have low catalytic activity. The highest propene selectivity is achieved with the highest dispersion of isolated and polymerized tetrahedrally coordinated V5+ species.

Initial propane reaction rates are highest for samples with dominant dispersed isolated and polymerized tetrahedrally coordinated V5+ species. Propene selectivity depends on the dispersion of these active species - higher dispersion leads to higher selectivity. CO is the main byproduct, with its formation increasing as active site dispersion decreases.

These factors contribute to the industrial significance of supported vanadium oxide catalysts for alkane transformations by allowing control over activity and selectivity through catalyst composition and preparation methods. Optimizing the dispersion and coordination of active vanadium species is crucial for achieving high propene yields in oxidative dehydrogenation processes.
