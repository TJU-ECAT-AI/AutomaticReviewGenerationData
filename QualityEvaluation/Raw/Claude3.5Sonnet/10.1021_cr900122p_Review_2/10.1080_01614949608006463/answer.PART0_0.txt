The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts significantly influence alkane transformations. Vanadium is a preferred element for selective oxidation of alkanes. The isolation of vanadium ions in a quasi-inert matrix plays a crucial role in catalyst performance. Multifunctionality is an important aspect of catalyst design and helps explain reaction mechanisms. The type of C-H bond activation is a key factor in alkane transformations. Acidity and basicity of the catalyst also play important roles. These factors contribute to the efficiency and industrial significance of processes like oxidative dehydrogenation and zeolite-catalyzed reactions. However, the document does not provide specific details on supported vanadium oxides, metal-exchanged zeolites, or their industrial applications.
