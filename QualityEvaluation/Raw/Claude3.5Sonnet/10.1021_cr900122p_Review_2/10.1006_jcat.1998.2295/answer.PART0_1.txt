[1] "Oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes provides a thermodynamically accessible route to the synthesis of alkenes from alkanes (13). Supported vanadium oxides (VOx) catalyze this reaction, but unselective combustion pathways limit alkene selectivities, especially at high conversions (418)."

[2] "The extent of dispersion and the local and extended structure of supported VOx species depend on the chemical identity and the surface area of the support (13, 17, 18)."

[3] "Polyvanadate species that form on ZrO2 at VOx surface densities above 34 VOx/nm2 provide active and selective sites for oxidative dehydrogenation reactions. Catalysts with lower VOx surface density and uncovered ZrO2 surfaces show lower alkene selectivities because of competing oxidation pathways leading to undesired CO and CO2 products."

[4] "Initial propene selectivities increase with increasing VOx surface density, as monovanadate species and exposed support sites, which favor primary combustion pathways, decrease in concentration."

[5] "Oxidative dehydrogenation rates per V-atom reach a maximum on VOx domains of intermediate size, which provide a balance between the activity of surface VOx species and their accessibility to reactants."

[6] "Interactions with supports determine the type of VOx structures present at a given surface density, but turnover rates do not depend on the identity of the support when differences in VOx structure are taken into account."

The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of supported vanadium oxide catalysts significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations, particularly in oxidative dehydrogenation processes. Key factors include:

1. Catalyst composition: The type of support (e.g., Al2O3, SiO2, HfO2, TiO2, ZrO2) and vanadium loading affect the dispersion and structure of VOx species.

2. VOx surface density: Higher surface densities generally lead to the formation of polyvanadate species, which are more active and selective for oxidative dehydrogenation.

3. Support interactions: The chemical identity of the support influences the dispersion and structure of VOx species at a given surface density.

4. VOx domain size: Intermediate-sized VOx domains provide an optimal balance between activity and accessibility to reactants.

5. Reaction conditions: High conversions can lead to unselective combustion pathways, limiting alkene selectivity.

These factors contribute to the industrial significance of supported vanadium oxide catalysts by affecting:

1. Alkene selectivity: Higher VOx surface densities and polyvanadate species formation improve selectivity by reducing primary combustion pathways.

2. Catalyst activity: Optimizing VOx domain size and surface density can maximize oxidative dehydrogenation rates.

3. Catalyst stability: Strong interactions between VOx species and certain supports (e.g., ZrO2, TiO2) can enhance catalyst stability and dispersion.

4. Process efficiency: Balancing selectivity and activity through careful catalyst design can improve overall process efficiency and economics.

While the literature does not directly address metal-exchanged zeolites, the principles of support interactions and catalyst structure influencing reaction mechanisms likely apply to zeolite-catalyzed reactions as well.

负载钒氧化物催化剂的组成、结构和反应条件显著影响烷烃转化的机理和效率，特别是在氧化脱氢过程中。关键因素包括：

1. 催化剂组成：载体类型（如Al2O3、SiO2、HfO2、TiO2、ZrO2）和钒负载量影响VOx物种的分散和结构。

2. VOx表面密度：较高的表面密度通常导致多钒酸盐物种的形成，这些物种对氧化脱氢反应更活跃和选择性更高。

3. 载体相互作用：载体的化学特性影响给定表面密度下VOx物种的分散和结构。

4. VOx域大小：中等大小的VOx域在活性和反应物可及性之间提供最佳平衡。

5. 反应条件：高转化率可能导致非选择性燃烧途径，限制烯烃选择性。

这些因素通过影响以下方面来促进负载钒氧化物催化剂的工业重要性：

1. 烯烃选择性：较高的VOx表面密度和多钒酸盐物种的形成通过减少主要燃烧途径来提高选择性。

2. 催化剂活性：优化VOx域大小和表面密度可以最大化氧化脱氢反应速率。

3. 催化剂稳定性：VOx物种与某些载体（如ZrO2、TiO2）之间的强相互作用可以增强催化剂的稳定性和分散性。

4. 过程效率：通过精心设计催化剂来平衡选择性和活性，可以提高整体过程效率和经济性。

虽然文献没有直接涉及金属交换沸石，但支持物相互作用和催化剂结构影响反应机理的原理可能也适用于沸石催化反应。
