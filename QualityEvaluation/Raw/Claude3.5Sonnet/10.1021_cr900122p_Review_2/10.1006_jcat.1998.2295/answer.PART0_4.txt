[1] "Oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes provides a thermodynamically accessible route to the synthesis of alkenes from alkanes (13). Supported vanadium oxides (VOx) catalyze this reaction, but unselective combustion pathways limit alkene selectivities, especially at high conversions (418)."

[2] "The structure and catalytic behavior of these materials depend strongly on VOx surface density. Polyvanadate species that form on ZrO2 at VOx surface densities above 34 VOx/nm2 provide active and selective sites for oxidative dehydrogenation reactions."

[3] "Initial propene selectivities increase with increasing VOx surface density, as monovanadate species and exposed support sites, which favor primary combustion pathways, decrease in concentration."

[4] "Oxidative dehydrogenation rates per V-atom reach a maximum on VOx domains of intermediate size, which provide a balance between the activity of surface VOx species and their accessibility to reactants."

[5] "Interactions with supports determine the type of VOx structures present at a given surface density, but turnover rates do not depend on the identity of the support when differences in VOx structure are taken into account."

The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of supported vanadium oxide catalysts significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane oxidative dehydrogenation reactions. Key factors include:

1. VOx surface density: Higher densities lead to the formation of polyvanadate species, which are more active and selective for oxidative dehydrogenation. However, an optimal intermediate density provides the best balance between activity and accessibility to reactants.

2. Support material: Different supports (e.g., ZrO2, Al2O3, SiO2) affect the dispersion and structure of VOx species at a given surface density. This influences the formation of active sites and catalyst performance.

3. VOx structure: The evolution from isolated monovanadates to polyvanadate domains and V2O5 crystallites as surface density increases affects catalytic behavior. Polyvanadate species are generally more selective for alkene formation.

4. Reaction conditions: High conversions can lead to unselective combustion pathways, limiting alkene selectivity.

These factors contribute to the industrial significance of supported vanadium oxide catalysts by allowing for the tuning of catalyst properties to optimize alkene yield and selectivity in oxidative dehydrogenation processes. The ability to control VOx structure and dispersion through support selection and surface density manipulation provides a means to balance the competing requirements of activity and selectivity in these important industrial reactions.

金属基催化剂的组成、结构和反应条件，包括负载的钒氧化物催化剂，显著影响烷烃氧化脱氢反应的机理和效率。主要因素包括：

1. VOx表面密度：较高的密度导致多钒酸盐物种的形成，这些物种对氧化脱氢反应更活跃和选择性。然而，最佳的中等密度可在活性和反应物可及性之间提供最佳平衡。

2. 载体材料：不同的载体（如ZrO2、Al2O3、SiO2）在给定表面密度下影响VOx物种的分散和结构。这影响活性位点的形成和催化剂性能。

3. VOx结构：随着表面密度增加，从孤立的单钒酸盐到多钒酸盐域再到V2O5晶体的演变影响催化行为。多钒酸盐物种通常对烯烃形成具有更高的选择性。

4. 反应条件：高转化率可能导致非选择性燃烧途径，限制烯烃选择性。

这些因素通过允许调整催化剂性能以优化氧化脱氢过程中的烯烃产率和选择性，从而促进了负载钒氧化物催化剂的工业重要性。通过载体选择和表面密度操纵来控制VOx结构和分散的能力，为在这些重要的工业反应中平衡活性和选择性的相互竞争需求提供了一种方法。
