          [1] "Oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes provides a thermodynamically accessible route to the synthesis of alkenes from alkanes (13). Supported vanadium oxides (VOx) catalyze this reaction, but unselective combustion pathways limit alkene selectivities, especially at high conversions (418)."

[2] "The extent of dispersion and the local and extended structure of supported VOx species depend on the chemical identity and the surface area of the support (13, 17, 18)."

[3] "Polyvanadate species that form on ZrO2 at VOx surface densities above 34 VOx/nm2 provide active and selective sites for oxidative dehydrogenation reactions. Catalysts with lower VOx surface density and uncovered ZrO2 surfaces show lower alkene selectivities because of competing oxidation pathways leading to undesired CO and CO2 products."

[4] "Initial propene selectivities increase with increasing VOx surface density, as monovanadate species and exposed support sites, which favor primary combustion pathways, decrease in concentration."

[5] "Oxidative dehydrogenation rates per V-atom reach a maximum on VOx domains of intermediate size, which provide a balance between the activity of surface VOx species and their accessibility to reactants."

[6] "Interactions with supports determine the type of VOx structures present at a given surface density, but turnover rates do not depend on the identity of the support when differences in VOx structure are taken into account."

          The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of supported vanadium oxide catalysts significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations, particularly in oxidative dehydrogenation processes. Key factors include:

1. Catalyst composition: The type of support (e.g., ZrO2, Al2O3, SiO2) and vanadium loading affect the dispersion and structure of VOx species.

2. VOx surface density: Higher surface densities generally lead to the formation of polyvanadate species, which are more active and selective for oxidative dehydrogenation. Optimal rates occur at intermediate densities that balance activity and reactant accessibility.

3. Support interactions: The chemical identity of the support influences the dispersion and structure of VOx species at a given surface density. However, turnover rates do not depend on the support identity when VOx structural differences are accounted for.

4. VOx structure: The evolution from isolated monovanadates to polyvanadate domains affects catalytic behavior. Polyvanadate species are generally more selective for alkene formation.

5. Reaction conditions: High conversions can lead to unselective combustion pathways, limiting alkene selectivity.

These factors contribute to the industrial significance of supported vanadium oxide catalysts by:

1. Allowing tuning of catalyst properties to optimize alkene yield and selectivity.
2. Providing a means to balance the competing requirements of activity and selectivity.
3. Enabling control of VOx structure and dispersion through support selection and surface density manipulation.

However, challenges remain in maximizing alkene yields, particularly at high conversions, due to competing combustion reactions. The study does not directly address metal-exchanged zeolites or their specific industrial significance in alkane transformations.

          金属基催化剂的组成、结构和反应条件，特别是负载型钒氧化物催化剂，显著影响烷烃转化的机理和效率，尤其是在氧化脱氢过程中。关键因素包括：

1. 催化剂组成：载体类型（如ZrO2、Al2O3、SiO2）和钒负载量影响VOx物种的分散和结构。

2. VOx表面密度：较高的表面密度通常导致多钒酸盐物种的形成，这些物种对氧化脱氢反应更活跃和选择性更高。最佳反应速率出现在中等密度，平衡了活性和反应物可及性。

3. 载体相互作用：载体的化学特性影响给定表面密度下VOx物种的分散和结构。然而，当考虑到VOx结构的差异时，转化频率不依赖于载体的特性。

4. VOx结构：从孤立的单钒酸盐到多钒酸盐域的演变影响催化行为。多钒酸盐物种通常对烯烃形成具有更高的选择性。

5. 反应条件：高转化率可能导致非选择性燃烧途径，限制烯烃选择性。

这些因素通过以下方式促进了负载型钒氧化物催化剂的工业重要性：

1. 允许调整催化剂性能以优化烯烃产率和选择性。
2. 提供平衡活性和选择性竞争需求的方法。
3. 通过载体选择和表面密度操纵来控制VOx结构和分散。

然而，由于存在竞争性燃烧反应，在高转化率下最大化烯烃产率仍然面临挑战。该研究没有直接涉及金属交换沸石或它们在烷烃转化中的具体工业重要性。
