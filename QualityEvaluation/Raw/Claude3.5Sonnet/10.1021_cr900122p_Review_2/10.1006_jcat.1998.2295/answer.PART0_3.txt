[1] "Oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes provides a thermodynamically accessible route to the synthesis of alkenes from alkanes (13). Supported vanadium oxides (VOx) catalyze this reaction, but unselective combustion pathways limit alkene selectivities, especially at high conversions (418)."

[2] "The structure and catalytic behavior of these materials depend strongly on VOx surface density. Polyvanadate species that form on ZrO2 at VOx surface densities above 34 VOx/nm2 provide active and selective sites for oxidative dehydrogenation reactions."

[3] "Initial propene selectivities increase with increasing VOx surface density, as monovanadate species and exposed support sites, which favor primary combustion pathways, decrease in concentration."

[4] "Oxidative dehydrogenation rates per V-atom reach a maximum on VOx domains of intermediate size, which provide a balance between the activity of surface VOx species and their accessibility to reactants."

[5] "Interactions with supports determine the type of VOx structures present at a given surface density, but turnover rates do not depend on the identity of the support when differences in VOx structure are taken into account."

The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of supported vanadium oxide catalysts significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane oxidative dehydrogenation reactions. Key factors include:

1. VOx surface density: Higher densities increase initial propene selectivity by reducing exposed support sites that favor combustion. However, optimal rates occur at intermediate densities that balance activity and reactant accessibility.

2. Support type: The support influences VOx structure formation, but does not directly affect turnover rates when structural differences are accounted for.

3. VOx structure: Polyvanadate species formed at higher surface densities (above 3-4 VOx/nm2 on ZrO2) provide active and selective sites for oxidative dehydrogenation.

4. Reaction conditions: High conversions tend to limit alkene selectivity due to unselective combustion pathways.

These factors contribute to the industrial significance of supported vanadium oxide catalysts by allowing tuning of activity and selectivity for alkane to alkene conversions. However, challenges remain in maximizing alkene yields, particularly at high conversions, due to competing combustion reactions.

负载型钒氧化物催化剂的组成、结构和反应条件显著影响烷烃氧化脱氢反应的机理和效率。关键因素包括：

1. VOx表面密度：较高的密度通过减少暴露的支撑物位点来提高初始丙烯选择性，这些位点有利于燃烧。然而，最佳反应速率出现在中等密度，平衡了活性和反应物可及性。

2. 支撑物类型：支撑物影响VOx结构的形成，但当考虑结构差异时，不直接影响转化频率。

3. VOx结构：在较高表面密度下形成的多钒酸盐物种（在ZrO2上高于3-4 VOx/nm2）为氧化脱氢提供活性和选择性位点。

4. 反应条件：由于非选择性燃烧途径，高转化率往往限制烯烃选择性。

这些因素通过允许调整烷烃到烯烃转化的活性和选择性，促进了负载型钒氧化物催化剂的工业重要性。然而，由于存在竞争性燃烧反应，在高转化率下最大化烯烃产率仍然面临挑战。
