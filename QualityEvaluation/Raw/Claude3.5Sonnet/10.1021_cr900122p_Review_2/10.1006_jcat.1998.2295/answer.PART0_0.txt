[1] "Oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes provides a thermodynamically accessible route to the synthesis of alkenes from alkanes (13). Supported vanadium oxides (VOx) catalyze this reaction, but unselective combustion pathways limit alkene selectivities, especially at high conversions (418)."

[2] "The extent of dispersion and the local and extended structure of supported VOx species depend on the chemical identity and the surface area of the support (13, 17, 18)."

[3] "Polyvanadate species that form on ZrO2 at VOx surface densities above 34 VOx/nm2 provide active and selective sites for oxidative dehydrogenation reactions. Catalysts with lower VOx surface density and uncovered ZrO2 surfaces show lower alkene selectivities because of competing oxidation pathways leading to undesired CO and CO2 products."

[4] "Initial propene selectivities increase with increasing VOx surface density, as monovanadate species and exposed support sites, which favor primary combustion pathways, decrease in concentration."

[5] "Oxidative dehydrogenation rates per V-atom reach a maximum on VOx domains of intermediate size, which provide a balance between the activity of surface VOx species and their accessibility to reactants."

[6] "Interactions with supports determine the type of VOx structures present at a given surface density, but turnover rates do not depend on the identity of the support when differences in VOx structure are taken into account."

The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of supported vanadium oxide catalysts significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations, particularly in oxidative dehydrogenation processes. 

The chemical identity and surface area of the support material affect the dispersion and structure of supported VOx species. This, in turn, impacts catalyst performance. For example, polyvanadate species forming on ZrO2 at certain surface densities provide active and selective sites for oxidative dehydrogenation reactions.

VOx surface density is a crucial factor. As it increases, initial propene selectivities improve due to a decrease in monovanadate species and exposed support sites that favor undesired combustion pathways. However, oxidative dehydrogenation rates per V-atom peak at intermediate VOx domain sizes, which balance activity and reactant accessibility.

The support material influences the type of VOx structures present at a given surface density. However, when accounting for differences in VOx structure, turnover rates are not dependent on the identity of the support.

While the study focuses on supported vanadium oxides for oxidative dehydrogenation, it does not discuss metal-exchanged zeolites or their industrial significance. The research demonstrates that carefully controlling catalyst composition and structure can optimize reaction efficiency and selectivity in alkane transformations.

金属基催化剂的组成、结构和反应条件，特别是负载型钒氧化物催化剂，对烷烃转化的机理和效率有显著影响，尤其是在氧化脱氢过程中。

载体材料的化学特性和表面积影响负载VOx物种的分散和结构，进而影响催化剂性能。例如，在特定表面密度下在ZrO2上形成的多钒酸盐物种为氧化脱氢反应提供了活性和选择性位点。

VOx表面密度是一个关键因素。随着密度增加，初始丙烯选择性提高，这是由于有利于不需要的燃烧途径的单钒酸盐物种和暴露的载体位点减少。然而，每个V原子的氧化脱氢速率在中等VOx域大小时达到峰值，这平衡了活性和反应物可及性。

载体材料影响给定表面密度下存在的VOx结构类型。但是，当考虑到VOx结构的差异时，转化频率不依赖于载体的特性。

虽然该研究重点关注了用于氧化脱氢的负载型钒氧化物，但未讨论金属交换沸石或其工业重要性。这项研究表明，仔细控制催化剂组成和结构可以优化烷烃转化反应的效率和选择性。
