[1] "Reactions of this kind are of great practical signicance. They are used for manufacturing such important chemicals as formaldehyde, acrolein, acrylic acid, phthalic and maleic anhydrides, etc."

[2] "A selective catalyst is supposed to perform a dual function: activate oxygen by generating oxygen species of proper reactivity, and activate the starting material to direct the oxidation in the desired way."

[3] "Bulk oxides with the oxygen of low lability (MgO, ZnO, TiO2, etc.), or silica-supported oxides of V, Mo, W are usually used for this purpose."

[4] "The distribution of iron and other metals in zeolites has been studied extensively. In general, Fe can occupy three positions in ZSM-5 matrix [8487] and can exist as:
1. Isolated ions in tetrahedral positions of the crystal lattice;
2. Isolated ions or small complexes inside the intracrystalline micropore space;
3. Finely dispersed oxide phase on the outer surface of zeolite crystals."

[5] "A detailed study of vanadium oxide supported on a variety of carriers [45] concluded that the presence of VOV fragments was essential for the selective oxidation."

The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations:

1. Catalyst composition: Supported vanadium oxides and metal-exchanged zeolites (particularly Fe-ZSM-5) are important catalysts for alkane transformations. The presence of specific metal species (e.g., VOV fragments in supported vanadium oxides) is essential for selective oxidation.

2. Catalyst structure: For zeolites, the distribution of metal ions (e.g., Fe in ZSM-5) can be in three positions: isolated ions in tetrahedral positions, isolated ions or small complexes in micropores, or as a dispersed oxide phase on the outer surface. This distribution affects catalyst performance.

3. Reaction conditions: Temperature and oxygen activation are crucial factors. Catalysts must activate oxygen to generate proper reactive species while also activating the starting material to direct oxidation.

4. Industrial significance: These catalysts are used to manufacture important chemicals like formaldehyde, acrolein, acrylic acid, and various anhydrides. Their ability to selectively oxidize alkanes makes them valuable for industrial processes.

5. Efficiency factors: The dual function of selective catalysts (oxygen activation and starting material activation) is key to their efficiency. Balancing these functions is critical for optimizing catalyst performance in alkane transformations.

金属基催化剂的组成、结构和反应条件显著影响烷烃转化的机理和效率：

1. 催化剂组成：负载的钒氧化物和金属交换的沸石（特别是Fe-ZSM-5）是烷烃转化的重要催化剂。特定金属物种的存在（如负载的钒氧化物中的VOV片段）对选择性氧化至关重要。

2. 催化剂结构：对于沸石，金属离子（如ZSM-5中的Fe）的分布可以在三个位置：四面体位置的孤立离子，微孔中的孤立离子或小复合物，或作为分散在外表面的氧化物相。这种分布影响催化剂性能。

3. 反应条件：温度和氧气活化是关键因素。催化剂必须活化氧气以产生适当的反应物种，同时还要活化起始材料以引导氧化。

4. 工业意义：这些催化剂用于生产重要的化学品，如甲醛、丙烯醛、丙烯酸和各种酐。它们选择性氧化烷烃的能力使其在工业过程中具有重要价值。

5. 效率因素：选择性催化剂的双重功能（氧气活化和起始材料活化）是其效率的关键。平衡这些功能对于优化催化剂在烷烃转化中的性能至关重要。
