[1] "The main reason for the limited use of oxidation catalysis in organic synthesis is the difculty of nding selective catalysts. A selective catalyst is supposed to perform a dual function: activate oxygen by generating oxygen species of proper reactivity, and activate the starting material to direct the oxidation in the desired way."

[2] "Generation of surface oxygen species and their role in partial oxidation reactions catalyzed by metal oxides are discussed."

[3] "Main attention is paid to a new concept related to a recent discovery of remarkable ability of Fe complexes stabilized in a ZSM-5 matrix to generate a new form of surface oxygen (a-oxygen) from N2O."

[4] "At room temperature, a-oxygen exhibits a high reactivity typical for the active oxygen of monooxygenases, and mimics its unique ability to perform selective oxidation of hydrocarbons."

[5] "A process of direct oxidation of benzene to phenol, recently demonstrated by Solutia on a pilot plant scale, is evidence of great potential of this approach."

[6] "The study of parafn partial oxidation catalysts gave different observations [44]. In this case, to avoid overoxidation, the active sites (usually vanadium ions) must be isolated in the inert matrix of the support to prevent oxygen diffusion from the neighboring sites."

[7] "A detailed study of vanadium oxide supported on a variety of carriers [45] concluded that the presence of VOV fragments was essential for the selective oxidation."

The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations:

1. Catalyst selectivity depends on its ability to activate oxygen and direct oxidation of the starting material.

2. Fe complexes in ZSM-5 zeolites can generate a new form of surface oxygen (α-oxygen) from N2O, which exhibits high reactivity and selectivity in hydrocarbon oxidation.

3. For paraffin partial oxidation, vanadium ions must be isolated in an inert support matrix to prevent overoxidation.

4. The presence of V-O-V fragments is essential for selective oxidation in supported vanadium oxide catalysts.

5. Reaction conditions, such as temperature and reactant concentrations, affect catalyst performance.

Industrial significance factors include:

1. The ability to perform selective oxidations, such as benzene to phenol.
2. Potential for direct, single-step processes that improve efficiency and reduce waste.
3. Mimicking of enzyme-like selectivity and activity in inorganic systems.
4. Possibility of using waste gases (e.g., N2O) as oxidants in industrial processes.

金属基催化剂的组成、结构和反应条件显著影响烷烃转化的机理和效率：

1. 催化剂的选择性取决于其激活氧气和引导起始物料氧化的能力。

2. ZSM-5分子筛中的Fe络合物可以从N2O产生新型表面氧（α-氧），在烃类氧化中表现出高反应性和选择性。

3. 对于烷烃部分氧化，钒离子必须被隔离在惰性载体基质中，以防止过度氧化。

4. 在负载型钒氧化物催化剂中，V-O-V片段的存在对选择性氧化至关重要。

5. 反应条件，如温度和反应物浓度，影响催化剂性能。

工业重要性因素包括：

1. 进行选择性氧化的能力，如苯到苯酚的转化。
2. 直接、单步过程的潜力，提高效率并减少废物。
3. 在无机系统中模仿酶的选择性和活性。
4. 在工业过程中利用废气（如N2O）作为氧化剂的可能性。
