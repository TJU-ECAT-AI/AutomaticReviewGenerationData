          [1] "Zeolites are crystalline alumosilicates and as such are of no interest for redox reactions. Unlike other oxides, they have an intracrystalline system of micropores of molecular dimensions. Chemical composition of zeolites can be modified by transition metals due to their incorporation either into the crystal lattice or into the micropore space."

[2] "Modification with Fe is a special case. Unlike other metals, whose oxides initially exhibit some activity of the same sort as that after the introduction into the zeolite, iron atoms in ZSM-5 matrix acquire fundamentally new features compared to the free Fe2O3."

[3] "The iron loses its ability to activate O2, but acquires special affinity towards nitrous oxide, causing its decomposition in a particular way [53]. This reaction gives rise to the formation of a new form of surface oxygen (called a-oxygen [54]) which, as one can see further, is behind a unique performance of FeZSM-5 zeolites in the oxidation with N2O."

[4] "The study of parafn partial oxidation catalysts gave different observations [44]. In this case, to avoid overoxidation, the active sites (usually vanadium ions) must be isolated in the inert matrix of the support to prevent oxygen diffusion from the neighboring sites."

[5] "A detailed study of vanadium oxide supported on a variety of carriers [45] concluded that the presence of VOV fragments was essential for the selective oxidation."

[6] "Bulk oxides with the oxygen of low lability (MgO, ZnO, TiO2, etc.), or silica-supported oxides of V, Mo, W are usually used for this purpose."

[7] "The distribution of iron and other metals in zeolites has been studied extensively. In general, Fe can occupy three positions in ZSM-5 matrix [8487] and can exist as:
1. Isolated ions in tetrahedral positions of the crystal lattice;
2. Isolated ions or small complexes inside the intracrystalline micropore space;
3. Finely dispersed oxide phase on the outer surface of zeolite crystals."

[8] "Depending on Fe content and on the mode of catalyst activation, Ca can be regulated within several orders of magnitude, reaching up to nearly 100 mmol/g for the most active catalysts."

[9] "Experimentally, observed characteristics of a-oxygen can be explained by binuclear quantum chemical model of a-sites [92]."

[10] "According to recent quantum mechanical calculations [99], methane oxidation on FeZSM-5 proceeds with participation of binuclear complexes having Fe atoms bound by (m-oxo-) and (m-hydroxo-) bridges."

[11] "Recently, based on successful pilot plant operation, Solutia made an announcement of the jointly developed new process and shared its plans for fast-track commercialization [113]. Typical performance data from the Pensacola pilot plant are given in Table 7."

          The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations:

1. Composition:
   - Zeolites can be modified with transition metals, altering their chemical composition and creating active sites for redox reactions.
   - Fe-modified ZSM-5 zeolites exhibit unique properties compared to other metal-modified zeolites or free Fe2O3.
   - Supported vanadium oxides, particularly those with VOV fragments, are essential for selective oxidation reactions.

2. Structure:
   - Zeolites have an intracrystalline system of micropores that influence catalyst behavior.
   - In Fe-ZSM-5, iron can occupy three positions: isolated ions in tetrahedral positions, isolated ions or small complexes in micropores, or as dispersed oxide on the outer surface.
   - Binuclear iron complexes with oxo- and hydroxo-bridges are believed to be active in methane oxidation on FeZSM-5.
   - For paraffin partial oxidation, vanadium ions must be isolated in an inert support matrix to prevent over-oxidation.

3. Reaction conditions:
   - Fe-ZSM-5 loses the ability to activate O2 but gains affinity for N2O decomposition, forming a unique "α-oxygen" species.
   - The mode of catalyst activation affects its activity, with Fe content in FeZSM-5 influencing the concentration of active sites.
   - Temperature and choice of oxidant (e.g., O2 vs. N2O) greatly affect reaction mechanisms and product selectivity.

These factors contribute to industrial significance by:
- Enabling more selective and efficient alkane transformation processes.
- Allowing for the development of novel reactions, such as the direct oxidation of benzene to phenol.
- Providing opportunities for process optimization and commercialization, as demonstrated by Solutia's pilot plant operations.
- Offering potential for utilizing waste products (e.g., N2O) in valuable chemical transformations.

          金属基催化剂的组成、结构和反应条件显著影响烷烃转化的机理和效率：

1. 组成：
   - 沸石可以通过过渡金属改性，改变其化学组成并创造活性位点用于氧化还原反应。
   - Fe改性的ZSM-5沸石与其他金属改性沸石或游离Fe2O3相比表现出独特的性质。
   - 负载的钒氧化物，特别是含有VOV片段的，对选择性氧化反应至关重要。

2. 结构：
   - 沸石具有影响催化剂行为的分子级微孔晶内系统。
   - 在Fe-ZSM-5中，铁可以占据三个位置：晶格四面体位置的孤立离子、微孔中的孤立离子或小型络合物、或外表面的分散氧化物。
   - 具有氧桥和羟基桥的双核铁络合物被认为在FeZSM-5上的甲烷氧化中起活性作用。
   - 对于烷烃部分氧化，钒离子必须被隔离在惰性载体基质中以防止过度氧化。

3. 反应条件：
   - Fe-ZSM-5失去活化O2的能力，但获得对N2O分解的亲和力，形成独特的"α-氧"物种。
   - 催化剂活化方式影响其活性，FeZSM-5中的Fe含量影响活性位点的浓度。
   - 温度和氧化剂的选择（如O2与N2O）极大地影响反应机理和产物选择性。

这些因素通过以下方式促进工业重要性：
- 实现更具选择性和效率的烷烃转化过程。
- 允许开发新型反应，如苯直接氧化为苯酚。
- 为工艺优化和商业化提供机会，如Solutia的试点工厂运营所示。
- 提供在有价值的化学转化中利用废弃物（如N2O）的潜力。
