[1] "Zeolites are crystalline alumosilicates and as such are of no interest for redox reactions. Unlike other oxides, they have an intracrystalline system of micropores of molecular dimensions. Chemical composition of zeolites can be modified by transition metals due to their incorporation either into the crystal lattice or into the micropore space."

[2] "Modification with Fe is a special case. Unlike other metals, whose oxides initially exhibit some activity of the same sort as that after the introduction into the zeolite, iron atoms in ZSM-5 matrix acquire fundamentally new features compared to the free Fe2O3."

[3] "The iron loses its ability to activate O2, but acquires special affinity towards nitrous oxide, causing its decomposition in a particular way [53]. This reaction gives rise to the formation of a new form of surface oxygen (called a-oxygen [54]) which, as one can see further, is behind a unique performance of FeZSM-5 zeolites in the oxidation with N2O."

[4] "The study of parafn partial oxidation catalysts gave different observations [44]. In this case, to avoid overoxidation, the active sites (usually vanadium ions) must be isolated in the inert matrix of the support to prevent oxygen diffusion from the neighboring sites."

[5] "For solving this problem, it would be very promising to find the way of neutralizing side functions of the zeolite matrix, leaving intact a-sites. Chemical modification of zeolites seems to be one of the most helpful ways. Presently, this technique is well developed and allows fine-tuning such important zeolite characteristics as chemical composition of external and internal surfaces, acidity, porosity, shape selectivity, etc. [120]."

The composition, structure and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations:

1. Metal incorporation into zeolites can modify their chemical composition and create active sites in the micropore space, enabling redox reactions that are not possible with pure alumosilicates.

2. The specific metal used and its incorporation method are crucial. For example, iron in ZSM-5 zeolites exhibits unique properties compared to other metals or free iron oxide.

3. Fe-ZSM-5 loses the ability to activate O2 but gains affinity for N2O decomposition, forming a unique "a-oxygen" species that enables novel oxidation reactions.

4. For paraffin partial oxidation, vanadium ions must be isolated in an inert support matrix to prevent over-oxidation via oxygen diffusion.

5. Chemical modification techniques allow fine-tuning of zeolite properties like surface composition, acidity, porosity and shape selectivity, which can enhance catalytic performance.

6. Reaction conditions, particularly the choice of oxidant (e.g. O2 vs N2O), greatly affect the reaction mechanism and product selectivity.

These factors contribute to industrial significance by enabling more selective and efficient alkane transformation processes compared to conventional catalysts. The ability to tailor catalyst properties and utilize novel reaction pathways (e.g. a-oxygen from N2O) opens up possibilities for improved or entirely new industrial processes.

[2] "A selective catalyst is supposed to perform a dual function: activate oxygen by generating oxygen species of proper reactivity, and activate the starting material to direct the oxidation in the desired way."

[3] "Bulk oxides with the oxygen of low lability (MgO, ZnO, TiO2, etc.), or silica-supported oxides of V, Mo, W are usually used for this purpose."

[4] "The distribution of iron and other metals in zeolites has been studied extensively. In general, Fe can occupy three positions in ZSM-5 matrix [8487] and can exist as:
1. Isolated ions in tetrahedral positions of the crystal lattice;
2. Isolated ions or small complexes inside the intracrystalline micropore space;
3. Finely dispersed oxide phase on the outer surface of zeolite crystals."
