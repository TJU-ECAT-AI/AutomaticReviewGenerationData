[1] "Zeolites are crystalline alumosilicates and as such are of no interest for redox reactions. Unlike other oxides, they have an intracrystalline system of micropores of molecular dimensions. Chemical composition of zeolites can be modified by transition metals due to their incorporation either into the crystal lattice or into the micropore space."

[2] "Modification with Fe is a special case. Unlike other metals, whose oxides initially exhibit some activity of the same sort as that after the introduction into the zeolite, iron atoms in ZSM-5 matrix acquire fundamentally new features compared to the free Fe2O3."

[3] "The iron loses its ability to activate O2, but acquires special affinity towards nitrous oxide, causing its decomposition in a particular way [53]. This reaction gives rise to the formation of a new form of surface oxygen (called a-oxygen [54]) which, as one can see further, is behind a unique performance of FeZSM-5 zeolites in the oxidation with N2O."

[4] "The study of parafn partial oxidation catalysts gave different observations [44]. In this case, to avoid overoxidation, the active sites (usually vanadium ions) must be isolated in the inert matrix of the support to prevent oxygen diffusion from the neighboring sites."

[5] "For solving this problem, it would be very promising to find the way of neutralizing side functions of the zeolite matrix, leaving intact a-sites. Chemical modification of zeolites seems to be one of the most helpful ways. Presently, this technique is well developed and allows fine-tuning such important zeolite characteristics as chemical composition of external and internal surfaces, acidity, porosity, shape selectivity, etc. [120]."

The composition, structure and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations:

1. Metal incorporation into zeolites can modify their chemical composition and create active sites in the micropore space, enabling redox reactions that are not possible with pure alumosilicates.

2. The specific metal used and its incorporation method are crucial. For example, iron in ZSM-5 zeolites exhibits unique properties compared to other metals or free iron oxide.

3. Fe-ZSM-5 loses the ability to activate O2 but gains affinity for N2O decomposition, forming a unique "a-oxygen" species that enables novel oxidation reactions.

4. For paraffin partial oxidation, vanadium ions must be isolated in an inert support matrix to prevent over-oxidation via oxygen diffusion.

5. Chemical modification techniques allow fine-tuning of zeolite properties like surface composition, acidity, porosity and shape selectivity, which can enhance catalytic performance.

6. Reaction conditions, particularly the choice of oxidant (e.g. O2 vs N2O), greatly affect the reaction mechanism and product selectivity.

These factors contribute to industrial significance by enabling more selective and efficient alkane transformation processes compared to conventional catalysts. The ability to tailor catalyst properties and utilize novel reaction pathways (e.g. a-oxygen from N2O) opens up possibilities for improved or entirely new industrial processes.

金属基催化剂的组成、结构和反应条件对烷烃转化的机理和效率有显著影响：

1. 将金属引入沸石可以改变其化学组成并在微孔空间中创造活性位点，从而实现纯铝硅酸盐无法进行的氧化还原反应。

2. 所使用的特定金属及其引入方法至关重要。例如，ZSM-5沸石中的铁与其他金属或游离氧化铁相比表现出独特的性质。

3. Fe-ZSM-5失去了活化O2的能力，但获得了对N2O分解的亲和力，形成独特的"a-氧"物种，能够进行新型氧化反应。

4. 对于石蜡部分氧化，钒离子必须被隔离在惰性载体基质中，以防止通过氧扩散导致过度氧化。

5. 化学改性技术允许对沸石性质进行微调，如表面组成、酸度、孔隙度和形状选择性，这可以提高催化性能。

6. 反应条件，特别是氧化剂的选择（如O2对N2O），极大地影响反应机理和产物选择性。

这些因素通过实现比传统催化剂更具选择性和效率的烷烃转化过程，为工业应用带来重要意义。定制催化剂性质和利用新型反应途径（如N2O产生的a-氧）的能力，为改进现有工艺或开发全新的工业过程提供了可能性。
