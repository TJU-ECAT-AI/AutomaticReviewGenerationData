[1] "The best results were obtained for a simple reaction, the oxidation of benzene to phenol over Fe-containing ZSM-5 zeolites. It proceeds with nearly 100% selectivity at 25-30% benzene conversion."

[2] "Properties of dinitrogen monoxide as an efficient oxygen donor have been highlighted in the study of such a delicate reaction as oxidative hydroxylation of the aromatic nucleus."

[3] "Results obtained over zeolites were rather unexpected. Table 2 shows catalytic properties of some zeolites tested under conditions similar to those for vanadia catalysts. A considerable amount of phenol was obtained in several cases. Especially interesting results were observed over AlPO4 and ZSM-5 zeolites."

[4] "Thus, iron introduced into a zeolite might be one of a few particular elements or even the only one which can efficiently catalyze this reaction."

[5] "Referring to ref. 59, the ability to produce the α-form of the surface oxygen is the main specific peculiarity of dinitrogen monoxide as an oxidant."

The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations:

1. For oxidative hydroxylation of aromatics, Fe-containing ZSM-5 zeolites show exceptional performance, achieving nearly 100% selectivity at 25-30% benzene conversion. This high efficiency is attributed to the unique properties of iron in the zeolite structure.

2. The use of dinitrogen monoxide as an oxidant is crucial for the reaction's success. It produces a specific form of surface oxygen (α-form) that is key to the catalytic process.

3. The zeolite structure itself plays an important role. ZSM-5 and AlPO4 zeolites showed particularly interesting results compared to conventional vanadia catalysts.

4. The chemical composition of the zeolite matrix affects catalyst performance. Iron introduced into an Al-Si matrix (Fe-Al-Si) shows significantly higher activity than in a Si-only matrix (Fe-Si) at the same iron content.

5. Reaction conditions, such as temperature and reactant concentrations, influence the selectivity and conversion rates. Optimal conditions need to be determined for each specific reaction.

These factors contribute to the industrial significance of these catalysts by enabling highly selective and efficient processes for valuable chemical transformations, particularly in the production of phenols and other hydroxylated aromatics. The ability to perform these reactions in the gas phase with high selectivity offers potential advantages over traditional liquid-phase processes.

金属基催化剂的组成、结构和反应条件对烷烃转化的机理和效率有显著影响：

1. 对于芳烃的氧化羟基化，含铁ZSM-5沸石表现出卓越的性能，在25-30%的苯转化率下实现了近100%的选择性。这种高效率归因于沸石结构中铁的独特性质。

2. 使用一氧化二氮作为氧化剂对反应的成功至关重要。它产生了一种特定形式的表面氧（α形式），这是催化过程的关键。

3. 沸石结构本身起着重要作用。与传统的钒催化剂相比，ZSM-5和AlPO4沸石显示出特别有趣的结果。

4. 沸石基质的化学组成影响催化剂性能。在相同的铁含量下，引入Al-Si基质的铁（Fe-Al-Si）比仅Si基质（Fe-Si）表现出显著更高的活性。

5. 反应条件，如温度和反应物浓度，影响选择性和转化率。需要为每种特定反应确定最佳条件。

这些因素通过实现有价值化学转化的高选择性和高效率过程，特别是在酚类和其他羟基化芳烃的生产中，为这些催化剂的工业重要性做出了贡献。能够在气相中以高选择性进行这些反应，为传统液相过程提供了潜在优势。
