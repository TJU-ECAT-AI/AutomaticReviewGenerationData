[1] "The best results were obtained for a simple reaction, the oxidation of benzene to phenol over Fe-containing ZSM-5 zeolites. It proceeds with nearly 100% selectivity at 25-30% benzene conversion."

[2] "Supported oxides of vanadium, molybdenum and tungsten demonstrated the best results. At 550°C in the presence of 30% water vapor in the gas flow, the vanadia catalyst provided a 71.5% selectivity towards phenol at 10.6% benzene conversion."

[3] "Results obtained over zeolites were rather unexpected. Table 2 shows catalytic properties of some zeolites tested under conditions similar to those for vanadia catalysts. A considerable amount of phenol was obtained in several cases. Especially interesting results were observed over AlPO4 and ZSM-5 zeolites."

[4] "Fig. 4 shows benzene conversion as a function of iron content in Fe-Al-Si samples plotted with the data of ref. 57. In fact, the samples Fe(Al)-0.004 and Fe(Al)-0.007 containing an extremely small amount of Fe (0.004 and 0.007 wt.-%, correspondingly) exhibit a very low activity. As iron content grows up to ca. 0.1 wt.-% of Fe2O3, benzene conversion increases considerably and then reaches a plateau with minor subsequent changes."

[5] "Properties of α-oxygen were studied in a number of papers [31,32,60-64] and were shown to be as follows:
1. It is formed on Fe-ZSM-5 zeolites and not on Fe2O3 or other iron-containing catalysts tested.
2. It is loosely bonded to the surface, the value of the bond energy being anomalously low.
3. It is thermally stable up to 300°C; above this point it desorbs irreversibly into the gas phase.
4. It is produced upon dinitrogen monoxide decomposition but not upon oxygen adsorption.
5. It exhibits high reactivity: at room temperature it is involved in oxygen isotopic exchange as well as in oxidation of carbon monoxide and methane."

The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations, particularly in oxidative dehydrogenation and zeolite-catalyzed reactions:

1. Composition: Iron-containing ZSM-5 zeolites show excellent performance in benzene oxidation to phenol, with nearly 100% selectivity at 25-30% conversion. The iron content in Fe-Al-Si samples is crucial, with optimal performance around 0.1 wt% Fe2O3.

2. Structure: Zeolites, especially AlPO4 and ZSM-5, demonstrate unexpected catalytic properties compared to traditional supported oxide catalysts. The unique porous structure of zeolites plays a role in their catalytic activity.

3. Reaction conditions: Temperature and presence of water vapor affect catalyst performance. For example, vanadia catalysts show 71.5% selectivity towards phenol at 10.6% benzene conversion at 550°C with 30% water vapor.

4. Oxidant choice: Dinitrogen monoxide (N2O) as an oxidant leads to the formation of a specific surface oxygen form (α-oxygen) on Fe-ZSM-5 zeolites. This α-oxygen is crucial for the reaction mechanism, exhibiting high reactivity and thermal stability up to 300°C.

These factors contribute to the industrial significance of these catalysts by enabling highly selective and efficient processes for valuable chemical transformations, such as the direct oxidation of benzene to phenol. The ability to fine-tune catalyst properties through composition and structure, combined with the use of alternative oxidants like N2O, opens up new possibilities for more environmentally friendly and economically viable industrial processes.

金属基催化剂的组成、结构和反应条件显著影响烷烃转化的机理和效率，特别是在氧化脱氢和沸石催化反应中：

1. 组成：含铁ZSM-5沸石在苯氧化制苯酚反应中表现出色，在25-30%转化率下具有接近100%的选择性。Fe-Al-Si样品中的铁含量至关重要，最佳性能出现在约0.1 wt% Fe2O3。

2. 结构：沸石，尤其是AlPO4和ZSM-5，与传统负载氧化物催化剂相比表现出意外的催化性能。沸石的独特多孔结构在其催化活性中起着重要作用。

3. 反应条件：温度和水蒸气的存在影响催化剂性能。例如，钒氧化物催化剂在550°C、30%水蒸气条件下，苯转化率为10.6%时对苯酚的选择性达到71.5%。

4. 氧化剂选择：使用一氧化二氮（N2O）作为氧化剂导致在Fe-ZSM-5沸石上形成特定的表面氧形式（α-氧）。这种α-氧对反应机理至关重要，表现出高反应活性和高达300°C的热稳定性。

这些因素通过实现有价值化学转化的高选择性和高效率过程，如苯直接氧化制苯酚，为这些催化剂的工业重要性做出贡献。通过组成和结构调整催化剂性能的能力，结合使用N2O等替代氧化剂，为更环保和经济可行的工业过程开辟了新的可能性。
