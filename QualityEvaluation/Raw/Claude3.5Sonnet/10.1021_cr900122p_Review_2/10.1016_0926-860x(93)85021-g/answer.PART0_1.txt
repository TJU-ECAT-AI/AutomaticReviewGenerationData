[1] "The best results were obtained for a simple reaction, the oxidation of benzene to phenol over Fe-containing ZSM-5 zeolites. It proceeds with nearly 100% selectivity at 25-30% benzene conversion."

[2] "Results obtained over zeolites were rather unexpected. Table 2 shows catalytic properties of some zeolites tested under conditions similar to those for vanadia catalysts. A considerable amount of phenol was obtained in several cases. Especially interesting results were observed over AlPO4 and ZSM-5 zeolites."

[3] "Though the curves in Figs. 4 and 5 are rather similar, a 10-fold difference in their abscissa scales can be noticed. To observe the whole picture of the influence of iron in the Fe-Si and Fe-Al-Si systems, the data in Fig. 6 are presented on logarithmic scales. The individual dependencies of the catalytic activities on iron concentration in these systems are significantly different."

[4] "Properties of α-oxygen were studied in a number of papers [31,32,60-64] and were shown to be as follows:
1. It is formed on Fe-ZSM-5 zeolites and not on Fe2O3 or other iron-containing catalysts tested.
2. It is loosely bonded to the surface, the value of the bond energy being anomalously low.
3. It is thermally stable up to 300°C; above this point it desorbs irreversibly into the gas phase.
4. It is produced upon dinitrogen monoxide decomposition but not upon oxygen adsorption.
5. It exhibits high reactivity: at room temperature it is involved in oxygen isotopic exchange as well as in oxidation of carbon monoxide and methane."

The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations:

1. Fe-containing ZSM-5 zeolites show high selectivity and conversion for benzene oxidation to phenol, outperforming traditional vanadium oxide catalysts.

2. The chemical composition of the zeolite matrix plays a crucial role. Fe-Al-Si systems show much higher activity compared to Fe-Si systems at the same iron content, suggesting that aluminum enhances the distribution of iron in the zeolite.

3. The concentration of iron in zeolites directly affects catalytic activity, with an optimal range existing for maximum performance.

4. The formation of a specific oxygen species (α-oxygen) on Fe-ZSM-5 zeolites is key to their catalytic activity. This species is not formed on bulk Fe2O3 or other iron-containing catalysts.

5. Reaction conditions, particularly the choice of oxidant, are critical. Dinitrogen monoxide is superior to molecular oxygen for selective oxidation reactions over these zeolite catalysts.

These factors contribute to the industrial significance of zeolite catalysts in alkane transformations by offering higher selectivity, milder reaction conditions, and potential for developing more environmentally friendly processes compared to traditional methods.

金属基催化剂的组成、结构和反应条件显著影响烷烃转化的机理和效率：

1. 含铁ZSM-5沸石在苯氧化为酚的反应中表现出高选择性和转化率，优于传统的钒氧化物催化剂。

2. 沸石基质的化学组成起着关键作用。在相同铁含量下，Fe-Al-Si体系比Fe-Si体系表现出更高的活性，这表明铝能够增强铁在沸石中的分布。

3. 沸石中铁的浓度直接影响催化活性，存在一个最佳范围以获得最大性能。

4. 在Fe-ZSM-5沸石上形成特定的氧物种（α-氧）是其催化活性的关键。这种物种不会在块状Fe2O3或其他含铁催化剂上形成。

5. 反应条件，特别是氧化剂的选择至关重要。在这些沸石催化剂上进行选择性氧化反应时，一氧化二氮优于分子氧。

这些因素通过提供更高的选择性、更温和的反应条件以及开发更环保工艺的潜力，为沸石催化剂在烷烃转化中的工业重要性做出了贡献，相比传统方法具有优势。
