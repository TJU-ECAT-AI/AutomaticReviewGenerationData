[1] "The best results were obtained for a simple reaction, the oxidation of benzene to phenol over Fe-containing ZSM-5 zeolites. It proceeds with nearly 100% selectivity at 25-30% benzene conversion."

[2] "Supported oxides of vanadium, molybdenum and tungsten demonstrated the best results. At 550C in the presence of 30% water vapor in the gas flow, the vanadia catalyst provided a 71.5% selectivity towards phenol at 10.6% benzene conversion."

[3] "Results obtained over zeolites were rather unexpected. Table 2 shows catalytic properties of some zeolites tested under conditions similar to those for vanadia catalysts. A considerable amount of phenol was obtained in several cases. Especially interesting results were observed over AlPO4 and ZSM-5 zeolites."

[4] "ZSM-5 zeolites to be promising catalytic systems for benzene oxidation to phenol by dinitrogen monoxide. These catalysts allowed the reaction to proceed within a 300-400C temperature range without water addition into the reaction mixture. Moreover, they provided a very high selectivity towards phenol."

[5] "Fig. 4 shows benzene conversion as a function of iron content in Fe-Al-Si samples plotted with the data of ref. 57. In fact, the samples Fe(Al)-0.004 and Fe(Al)-0.007 containing an extremely small amount of Fe (0.004 and 0.007 wt.-%, correspondingly) exhibit a very low activity. As iron content grows up to ca. 0.1 wt.-% of Fe2O3, benzene conversion increases considerably and then reaches a plateau with minor subsequent changes."

The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations:

1. For benzene oxidation to phenol, Fe-containing ZSM-5 zeolites showed the best results, with nearly 100% selectivity at 25-30% benzene conversion.

2. Supported oxides of vanadium, molybdenum, and tungsten were effective catalysts. Vanadia catalyst achieved 71.5% selectivity at 10.6% benzene conversion at 550°C with 30% water vapor.

3. ZSM-5 zeolites allowed the reaction to proceed at 300-400°C without water addition, providing high selectivity.

4. Iron content in zeolites is crucial. As iron content increases up to 0.1 wt% Fe2O3, benzene conversion increases significantly before reaching a plateau.

5. Reaction conditions such as temperature and water vapor content affect catalyst performance.

These factors contribute to industrial significance by enabling high selectivity and conversion rates, allowing for milder reaction conditions, and utilizing more efficient catalysts. The ability to fine-tune catalyst composition and structure offers potential for further optimization and application in various alkane transformation processes.

金属基催化剂的组成、结构和反应条件显著影响烷烃转化的机理和效率：

1. 对于苯氧化制苯酚，含铁ZSM-5沸石表现最佳，在25-30%的苯转化率下实现近100%的选择性。

2. 负载的钒、钼和钨氧化物是有效的催化剂。在550°C和30%水蒸气存在下，钒基催化剂在10.6%的苯转化率下达到71.5%的选择性。

3. ZSM-5沸石允许反应在300-400°C下进行，无需添加水，并提供高选择性。

4. 沸石中的铁含量至关重要。随着铁含量增加到0.1 wt% Fe2O3，苯转化率显著增加，然后达到平稳。

5. 温度和水蒸气含量等反应条件影响催化剂性能。

这些因素通过实现高选择性和转化率、允许更温和的反应条件以及使用更高效的催化剂，对工业意义做出贡献。能够精细调节催化剂组成和结构为进一步优化和应用于各种烷烃转化过程提供了潜力。
