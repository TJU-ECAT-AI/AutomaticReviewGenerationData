[1] "The best results were obtained for a simple reaction, the oxidation of benzene to phenol over Fe-containing ZSM-5 zeolites. It proceeds with nearly 100% selectivity at 25-30% benzene conversion."

[2] "Results obtained over zeolites were rather unexpected. Table 2 shows catalytic properties of some zeolites tested under conditions similar to those for vanadia catalysts. A considerable amount of phenol was obtained in several cases. Especially interesting results were observed over AlPO4 and ZSM-5 zeolites."

[3] "These catalysts allowed the reaction to proceed within a 300-400°C temperature range without water addition into the reaction mixture. Moreover, they provided a very high selectivity towards phenol."

[4] "To investigate the role of iron, the authors [57] have synthesized a set of zeolite samples with ZSM-5 structure and the same mole ratio SiO2/Al2O3 = 100, but with various Fe content from 0.004 to 0.72 wt.-% of Fe2O3."

A considerable amount of phenol was obtained in several cases. Especially interesting results were observed over AlPO4 and ZSM-5 zeolites."

[3] "Though the curves in Figs. 4 and 5 are rather similar, a 10-fold difference in their abscissa scales can be noticed. To observe the whole picture of the influence of iron in the Fe-Si and Fe-Al-Si systems, the data in Fig. 6 are presented on logarithmic scales. The individual dependencies of the catalytic activities on iron concentration in these systems are significantly different."

[4] "Properties of α-oxygen were studied in a number of papers [31,32,60-64] and were shown to be as follows:
1. It is formed on Fe-ZSM-5 zeolites and not on Fe2O3 or other iron-containing catalysts tested.
2. It is loosely bonded to the surface, the value of the bond energy being anomalously low.
3. It is thermally stable up to 300°C; above this point it desorbs irreversibly into the gas phase.
4. It is produced upon dinitrogen monoxide decomposition but not upon oxygen adsorption.
5. It exhibits high reactivity: at room temperature it is involved in oxygen isotopic exchange as well as in oxidation of carbon monoxide and methane."

The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations:

1. Fe-containing ZSM-5 zeolites show high selectivity and conversion for benzene oxidation to phenol, outperforming traditional vanadium oxide catalysts.

2. The chemical composition of the zeolite matrix plays a crucial role. Fe-Al-Si systems show much higher activity compared to Fe-Si systems at the same iron content, suggesting that aluminum enhances the distribution of iron in the zeolite.

3. The concentration of iron in zeolites directly affects catalytic activity, with an optimal range existing for maximum performance.

4. The formation of a specific oxygen species (α-oxygen) on Fe-ZSM-5 zeolites is key to their catalytic activity. This species is not formed on bulk Fe2O3 or other iron-containing catalysts.

5. Reaction conditions, particularly the choice of oxidant, are critical. Dinitrogen monoxide is superior to molecular oxygen for selective oxidation reactions over these zeolite catalysts.

These factors contribute to the industrial significance of zeolite catalysts in alkane transformations by offering higher selectivity, milder reaction conditions, and potential for developing more environmentally friendly processes compared to traditional methods.

The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations:

1. For oxidative hydroxylation of aromatics, Fe-containing ZSM-5 zeolites show exceptional performance, achieving nearly 100% selectivity at 25-30% benzene conversion. This high efficiency is attributed to the unique properties of iron in the zeolite structure.

2. The use of dinitrogen monoxide as an oxidant is crucial for the reaction's success. It produces a specific form of surface oxygen (α-form) that is key to the catalytic process.

3. The zeolite structure itself plays an important role. ZSM-5 and AlPO4 zeolites showed particularly interesting results compared to conventional vanadia catalysts.

4. The chemical composition of the zeolite matrix affects catalyst performance. Iron introduced into an Al-Si matrix (Fe-Al-Si) shows significantly higher activity than in a Si-only matrix (Fe-Si) at the same iron content.

5. Reaction conditions, such as temperature and reactant concentrations, influence the selectivity and conversion rates. Optimal conditions need to be determined for each specific reaction.

These factors contribute to the industrial significance of these catalysts by enabling highly selective and efficient processes for valuable chemical transformations, particularly in the production of phenols and other hydroxylated aromatics. The ability to perform these reactions in the gas phase with high selectivity offers potential advantages over traditional liquid-phase processes.
