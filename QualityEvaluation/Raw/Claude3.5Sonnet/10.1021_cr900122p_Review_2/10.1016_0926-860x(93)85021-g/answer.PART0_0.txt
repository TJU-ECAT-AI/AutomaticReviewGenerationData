[1] "The best results were obtained for a simple reaction, the oxidation of benzene to phenol over Fe-containing ZSM-5 zeolites. It proceeds with nearly 100% selectivity at 25-30% benzene conversion."

[2] "Results obtained over zeolites were rather unexpected. Table 2 shows catalytic properties of some zeolites tested under conditions similar to those for vanadia catalysts. A considerable amount of phenol was obtained in several cases. Especially interesting results were observed over AlPO4 and ZSM-5 zeolites."

[3] "These catalysts allowed the reaction to proceed within a 300-400°C temperature range without water addition into the reaction mixture. Moreover, they provided a very high selectivity towards phenol."

[4] "To investigate the role of iron, the authors [57] have synthesized a set of zeolite samples with ZSM-5 structure and the same mole ratio SiO2/Al2O3 = 100, but with various Fe content from 0.004 to 0.72 wt.-% of Fe2O3."

[5] "Referring to ref. 59, the ability to produce the α-form of the surface oxygen is the main specific peculiarity of dinitrogen monoxide as an oxidant."

The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations:

1. Fe-containing ZSM-5 zeolites show excellent performance in benzene oxidation to phenol, achieving nearly 100% selectivity at 25-30% conversion.

2. The chemical composition of the zeolite matrix plays a crucial role. AlPO4 and ZSM-5 zeolites demonstrated particularly interesting results compared to other zeolites and vanadia catalysts.

3. Reaction conditions such as temperature range (300-400°C) and the absence of water in the reaction mixture contribute to high selectivity towards phenol.

4. Iron content in ZSM-5 zeolites is a critical factor. Samples with varying Fe content from 0.004 to 0.72 wt.-% of Fe2O3 were studied to understand its role in catalytic activity.

5. The oxidant choice is crucial. Dinitrogen monoxide's ability to produce α-form surface oxygen is a key factor in its effectiveness as an oxidant in these reactions.

These factors contribute to the industrial significance of these catalysts by providing high selectivity, good conversion rates, and the potential for more environmentally friendly processes compared to traditional methods. The ability to fine-tune catalyst composition and reaction conditions offers opportunities for optimizing industrial processes for alkane transformations.
