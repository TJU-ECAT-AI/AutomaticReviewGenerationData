[1] "Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts are most active and selective for the aromatisation of propane [1]. It is widely accepted that their activity and selectivity result from their bifunctional properties, whereby gallium species are responsible for their dehydrogenation-hydrogenation activity and the Brönsted acid sites of the zeolite provide the centres necessary for chain growth."

[2] "Recently, it was shown that dual active sites are responsible for the activation of propane on Ga/H-ZSM-5 [2-4]. These dual active sites consist of highly dispersed (Ga3+, O2-) ions pairs, acting in synergy with neighbouring Brönsted sites which initially activate propane as a protonated pseudo-cyclopropane species."

[3] "Changes in the propane aromatisation activity and selectivity of these catalysts as a function of the number of reaction (reducing conditions)-regeneration (oxidative conditions) cycles sustained were explained by the migration of gallium species in and out of the zeolite intracrystalline void space [5] as substantiated by detailed catalyst characterisation [6]."

[4] "H2-O2 pretreatment thus appear to be a promising way to preactivate and stabilise Ga-modified aromatisation catalysts in commercial operation."

The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts, particularly Ga/H-ZSM-5, significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations, especially in propane aromatization.

The catalysts' effectiveness stems from their bifunctional properties. Gallium species provide dehydrogenation-hydrogenation activity, while the zeolite's Brönsted acid sites enable chain growth. The key to high activity and selectivity lies in the formation of dual active sites, consisting of highly dispersed (Ga3+, O2-) ion pairs working synergistically with neighboring Brönsted sites.

Reaction-regeneration cycles, involving reducing and oxidative conditions, affect catalyst performance through the migration of gallium species within the zeolite structure. This migration process is crucial for maintaining and enhancing catalyst activity and selectivity over time.

Pretreatment conditions, specifically H2-O2 cycles, play a vital role in optimizing catalyst performance. This pretreatment method has shown promise in preactivating and stabilizing Ga-modified aromatization catalysts for industrial applications. It enhances gallium dispersion, creates more dual active sites, and stabilizes the highly dispersed gallium species in their most active oxidation state.

These factors contribute significantly to the industrial importance of these catalysts. The ability to fine-tune catalyst properties through composition, structure, and pretreatment conditions allows for optimized performance in alkane transformation processes, particularly in propane aromatization. This optimization leads to improved efficiency and selectivity, making these catalysts valuable for industrial-scale applications.

金属基催化剂，特别是Ga/H-ZSM-5的组成、结构和反应条件，对烷烃转化的机理和效率有显著影响，尤其是在丙烷芳构化过程中。

这些催化剂的有效性源于其双功能特性。镓物种提供脱氢-加氢活性，而沸石的Brönsted酸性位点则促进链增长。高活性和选择性的关键在于形成双活性位点，这些位点由高度分散的(Ga3+, O2-)离子对与邻近的Brönsted位点协同工作组成。

涉及还原和氧化条件的反应-再生循环通过镓物种在沸石结构内的迁移影响催化剂性能。这种迁移过程对于长期维持和提高催化剂活性和选择性至关重要。

预处理条件，特别是H2-O2循环，在优化催化剂性能方面起着至关重要的作用。这种预处理方法在预活化和稳定工业应用中的Ga改性芳构化催化剂方面显示出了潜力。它增强了镓的分散度，创造了更多的双活性位点，并将高度分散的镓物种稳定在其最活跃的氧化态。

这些因素对这些催化剂的工业重要性贡献显著。通过组成、结构和预处理条件来微调催化剂特性的能力，允许在烷烃转化过程中，特别是在丙烷芳构化中优化性能。这种优化导致效率和选择性的提高，使这些催化剂对工业规模应用具有重要价值。
