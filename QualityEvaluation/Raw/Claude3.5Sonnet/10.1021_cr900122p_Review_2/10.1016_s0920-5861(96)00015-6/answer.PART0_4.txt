[1] "Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts are most active and selective for the aromatisation of propane [1]. It is widely accepted that their activity and selectivity result from their bifunctional properties, whereby gallium species are responsible for their dehydrogenation-hydrogenation activity and the Brønsted acid sites of the zeolite provide the centres necessary for chain growth."

[2] "Recently, it was shown that dual active sites are responsible for the activation of propane on Ga/H-ZSM-5 [2-4]. These dual active sites consist of highly dispersed (Ga3+, O2-) ions pairs, acting in synergy with neighbouring Brønsted sites which initially activate propane as a protonated pseudo-cyclopropane species."

[3] "Several authors have also reported the inhibitory effect of hydrogen on propane transformation over Zn/H-ZSM-5 [24] and Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts [25]. A possible explanation is that the limiting step of the propane dehydrogenation is the removal of hydrogen [26]."

[4] "H2-O2 pretreatment of Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts is thus a means to ensure rapid catalyst preactivation and stabilisation in large scale light alkane aromatisation units."

The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations:

1. Composition: Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts are highly active and selective for propane aromatization due to their bifunctional properties. The gallium species provide dehydrogenation-hydrogenation activity, while the zeolite's Brønsted acid sites enable chain growth.

2. Structure: Dual active sites consisting of highly dispersed (Ga3+, O2-) ion pairs work synergistically with neighboring Brønsted sites to activate propane. This structural arrangement is crucial for the catalyst's effectiveness.

3. Reaction conditions: 
   a) Hydrogen presence can inhibit propane transformation, possibly because hydrogen removal is a limiting step in propane dehydrogenation.
   b) H2-O2 pretreatment enhances catalyst performance by increasing gallium dispersion and creating more dual active sites.

4. Industrial significance: The H2-O2 pretreatment method offers a way to rapidly preactivate and stabilize Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts for use in large-scale light alkane aromatization units, improving their industrial applicability.

These factors contribute to the overall efficiency of alkane transformations, particularly in processes such as aromatization. The ability to fine-tune catalyst composition, structure, and pretreatment conditions allows for optimized performance in industrial applications.

金属基催化剂的组成、结构和反应条件显著影响烷烃转化的机理和效率：

1. 组成：Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂对丙烷芳构化具有高活性和选择性，这是由于它们的双功能特性。镓物种提供脱氢-加氢活性，而分子筛的Brønsted酸性位点则实现链增长。

2. 结构：由高度分散的(Ga3+, O2-)离子对组成的双活性位点与相邻的Brønsted位点协同工作，活化丙烷。这种结构安排对催化剂的有效性至关重要。

3. 反应条件：
   a) 氢气的存在可能抑制丙烷转化，可能是因为氢气的去除是丙烷脱氢的限速步骤。
   b) H2-O2预处理通过增加镓的分散度和创造更多双活性位点来提高催化剂性能。

4. 工业意义：H2-O2预处理方法为大规模轻烷烃芳构化装置中Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂的快速预活化和稳定化提供了一种方法，提高了它们的工业适用性。

这些因素共同影响烷烃转化的整体效率，特别是在芳构化等过程中。通过精细调节催化剂组成、结构和预处理条件，可以优化工业应用中的性能。
