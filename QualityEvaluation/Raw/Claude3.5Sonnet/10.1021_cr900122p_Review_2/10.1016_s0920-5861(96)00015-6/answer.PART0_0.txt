[1] "Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts are most active and selective for the aromatisation of propane [1]. It is widely accepted that their activity and selectivity result from their bifunctional properties, whereby gallium species are responsible for their dehydrogenation-hydrogenation activity and the Brönsted acid sites of the zeolite provide the centres necessary for chain growth."

[2] "Recently, it was shown that dual active sites are responsible for the activation of propane on Ga/H-ZSM-5 [2-4]. These dual active sites consist of highly dispersed (Ga3+, O2-) ions pairs, acting in synergy with neighbouring Brönsted sites which initially activate propane as a protonated pseudo-cyclopropane species."

[3] "Changes in the propane aromatisation activity and selectivity of these catalysts as a function of the number of reaction (reducing conditions)-regeneration (oxidative conditions) cycles sustained were explained by the migration of gallium species in and out of the zeolite intracrystalline void space [5] as substantiated by detailed catalyst characterisation [6]."

[4] "Hydrogen treatment increases activity and selectivity to aromatics while decreasing the formation of methane. Subsequent oxygen treatment enhances further the activity and aromatics selectivity and has little effect on methane selectivity."

[5] "These improvements of catalytic performance are explained by gallium migration in reducing conditions. The concentration of highly dispersed gallium species is thereby enhanced. These species, in association with Brönsted centers, were reported previously to constitute the dual catalytic sites responsible for alkane activation."

The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts, particularly Ga/H-ZSM-5, significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations, especially in propane aromatization. 

The bifunctional properties of Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts are key to their high activity and selectivity. Gallium species provide dehydrogenation-hydrogenation activity, while Brönsted acid sites from the zeolite facilitate chain growth. The dual active sites, consisting of highly dispersed (Ga3+, O2-) ion pairs working in synergy with neighboring Brönsted sites, are responsible for propane activation.

Reaction conditions, particularly reducing and oxidative atmospheres, play a crucial role in catalyst performance. Hydrogen treatment increases activity and selectivity to aromatics while decreasing methane formation. Subsequent oxygen treatment further enhances activity and aromatics selectivity without significantly affecting methane selectivity.

The migration of gallium species in and out of the zeolite intracrystalline void space during reaction-regeneration cycles explains changes in catalytic performance. Reducing conditions promote gallium migration, enhancing the concentration of highly dispersed gallium species. These dispersed species, in association with Brönsted centers, form the dual catalytic sites responsible for alkane activation.

The industrial significance of these catalysts is evident in their ability to efficiently transform propane into more valuable aromatic products. The possibility of tuning catalyst performance through controlled pretreatment cycles (e.g., H2-O2 cycles) offers a promising approach for optimizing and stabilizing these catalysts for use in industrial aromatization units.

金属基催化剂的组成、结构和反应条件，特别是Ga/H-ZSM-5，显著影响烷烃转化的机理和效率，尤其是在丙烷芳构化过程中。

Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂的双功能特性是其高活性和选择性的关键。镓物种提供脱氢-加氢活性，而沸石的Brönsted酸位点促进链增长。由高度分散的(Ga3+, O2-)离子对与邻近的Brönsted位点协同作用组成的双活性位点负责丙烷的活化。

反应条件，特别是还原和氧化气氛，在催化剂性能中起着至关重要的作用。氢气处理增加了活性和芳烃选择性，同时降低了甲烷的生成。随后的氧气处理进一步提高了活性和芳烃选择性，对甲烷选择性影响不大。

在反应-再生循环过程中，镓物种在沸石晶内孔隙空间的迁移解释了催化性能的变化。还原条件促进镓的迁移，增加了高度分散的镓物种的浓度。这些分散的物种与Brönsted中心结合，形成负责烷烃活化的双催化位点。

这些催化剂的工业重要性体现在它们能够有效地将丙烷转化为更有价值的芳烃产品。通过控制的预处理循环（例如H2-O2循环）来调整催化剂性能的可能性，为优化和稳定这些催化剂在工业芳构化装置中的使用提供了一种有前景的方法。
