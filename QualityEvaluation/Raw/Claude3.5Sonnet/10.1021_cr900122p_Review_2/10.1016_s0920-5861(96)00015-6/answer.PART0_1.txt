[1] "Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts are most active and selective for the aromatisation of propane [1]. It is widely accepted that their activity and selectivity result from their bifunctional properties, whereby gallium species are responsible for their dehydrogenation-hydrogenation activity and the Brønsted acid sites of the zeolite provide the centres necessary for chain growth."

[2] "Recently, it was shown that dual active sites are responsible for the activation of propane on Ga/H-ZSM-5 [2-4]. These dual active sites consist of highly dispersed (Ga3+, O2-) ions pairs, acting in synergy with neighbouring Brønsted sites which initially activate propane as a protonated pseudo-cyclopropane species."

[3] "Hydrogen treatment increases activity and selectivity to aromatics while decreasing the formation of methane. Subsequent oxygen treatment enhances further the activity and aromatics selectivity and has little effect on methane selectivity."

[4] "These improvements of catalytic performance are explained by gallium migration in reducing conditions. The concentration of highly dispersed gallium species is thereby enhanced. These species, in association with Brønsted centers, were reported previously to constitute the dual catalytic sites responsible for alkane activation."

The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts, particularly Ga/H-ZSM-5, significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations, especially in processes like propane aromatization. 

The key factors contributing to their industrial significance include:

1. Bifunctional properties: Gallium species provide dehydrogenation-hydrogenation activity, while Brønsted acid sites in the zeolite enable chain growth.

2. Dual active sites: Highly dispersed (Ga3+, O2-) ion pairs work synergistically with neighboring Brønsted sites to activate propane.

3. Pretreatment effects: Hydrogen treatment increases activity and selectivity to aromatics while reducing methane formation. Subsequent oxygen treatment further enhances activity and aromatics selectivity.

4. Gallium migration and dispersion: Reducing conditions promote gallium migration, increasing the concentration of highly dispersed gallium species. These dispersed species, combined with Brønsted centers, form the dual catalytic sites responsible for alkane activation.

5. Oxidation state: The Ga(III)/Ga(I) redox couple plays a crucial role in dehydrogenation processes and hydrogen recombination.

These factors contribute to the enhanced catalytic performance of Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts in alkane transformations, making them industrially significant for processes such as propane aromatization.

金属基催化剂的组成、结构和反应条件，特别是Ga/H-ZSM-5，显著影响烷烃转化的机理和效率，尤其是在丙烷芳构化等过程中。

影响其工业重要性的关键因素包括：

1. 双功能性：镓物种提供脱氢-加氢活性，而沸石中的Brønsted酸位可实现链增长。

2. 双活性位点：高度分散的(Ga3+, O2-)离子对与邻近的Brønsted位点协同工作，激活丙烷。

3. 预处理效果：氢气处理增加活性和芳烃选择性，同时减少甲烷生成。随后的氧气处理进一步提高活性和芳烃选择性。

4. 镓的迁移和分散：还原条件促进镓的迁移，增加高度分散的镓物种浓度。这些分散的物种与Brønsted中心结合，形成负责烷烃活化的双催化位点。

5. 氧化态：Ga(III)/Ga(I)氧化还原对在脱氢过程和氢重组中起关键作用。

这些因素共同提高了Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂在烷烃转化中的催化性能，使其在丙烷芳构化等工业过程中具有重要意义。
