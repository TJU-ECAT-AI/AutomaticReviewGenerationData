Unfortunately, this document does not contain any specific information about the composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts such as supported vanadium oxides and metal-exchanged zeolites, or their influence on alkane transformation mechanisms and efficiency. The abstract only broadly mentions "catalytic alkane functionalization" without going into details about specific catalysts or processes like oxidative dehydrogenation or zeolite-catalyzed reactions. There is no information provided about industrial significance or factors contributing to it. The document appears to be a general review of advances in alkane CH activation and functionalization, but the specific details requested in the question are not present in the given text.

遗憾的是,这份文档并未包含任何关于金属基催化剂(如负载的钒氧化物和金属交换沸石)的组成、结构和反应条件,或它们对烷烃转化机理和效率影响的具体信息。摘要仅笼统地提到了"催化烷烃官能化",但没有深入讨论具体的催化剂或氧化脱氢、沸石催化反应等过程。文中也没有提供有关工业重要性或影响因素的信息。该文档似乎是对烷烃C-H活化和官能化进展的一般性综述,但问题中要求的具体细节在给定的文本中并不存在。
