The literature provides limited information specifically addressing metal-based catalysts for alkane transformations. However, it does discuss some aspects of metal-zeolite catalysts and their influence on alkane reactions:

1. The review covers advances in understanding transformations of C2-C4 alkanes over acid and bifunctional zeolite catalysts, including activation mechanisms, reaction schemes, and active sites.

2. It mentions the composition of working catalysts as an important factor, though details are not provided in the available excerpt.

3. The paper compares Zn and Ga/MFI catalysts, suggesting that different metal components can influence catalyst performance.

4. n-Butane hydroisomerization and dehydroisomerization are discussed, which are relevant processes for alkane transformations over metal-zeolite catalysts.

5. Alkylation of aromatics with small alkanes is covered, indicating that metal-zeolite catalysts can facilitate reactions between alkanes and other hydrocarbons.

While the excerpt does not provide comprehensive information on oxidative dehydrogenation or specific details on industrial significance, it does suggest that metal-zeolite catalysts play a role in various alkane transformation processes. The composition and type of metal used (e.g., Zn vs. Ga) appear to be important factors in determining catalyst performance and reaction mechanisms.

这篇文献对金属基催化剂在烷烃转化中的作用提供了有限的具体信息。但是，它确实讨论了一些金属-沸石催化剂的方面及其对烷烃反应的影响：

1. 该综述涵盖了对酸性和双功能沸石催化剂上C2-C4烷烃转化的理解进展，包括活化机理、反应方案和活性位点。

2. 它提到了工作催化剂的组成是一个重要因素，尽管在可用的摘录中没有提供详细信息。

3. 文章比较了Zn和Ga/MFI催化剂，表明不同的金属组分可以影响催化剂性能。

4. 讨论了正丁烷的氢异构化和脱氢异构化，这些是金属-沸石催化剂上烷烃转化的相关过程。

5. 涉及了芳烃与小分子烷烃的烷基化，表明金属-沸石催化剂可以促进烷烃与其他碳氢化合物之间的反应。

虽然摘录没有提供关于氧化脱氢或工业重要性的具体详细信息，但它确实表明金属-沸石催化剂在各种烷烃转化过程中发挥作用。所使用的金属的组成和类型（例如Zn与Ga）似乎是决定催化剂性能和反应机理的重要因素。
