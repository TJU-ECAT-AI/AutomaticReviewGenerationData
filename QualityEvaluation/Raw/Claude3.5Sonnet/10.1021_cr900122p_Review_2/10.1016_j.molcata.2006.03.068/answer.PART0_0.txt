The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts significantly influence alkane transformations. The review discusses advances in understanding transformations over acid and bifunctional zeolite catalysts, focusing on C2-C4 alkanes. 

For metal-exchanged zeolites, the composition plays a crucial role. The paper compares Zn and Ga/MFI catalysts, as well as Pt or Pd/HMFI catalysts for different reactions. The nature of the metal impacts the reaction mechanism and efficiency.

The structure of the catalyst, particularly for zeolites, affects the reaction. The review mentions bifunctional aromatization schemes, implying that the catalyst structure facilitates both acid and metal-catalyzed steps.

Reaction conditions are also important, though not explicitly detailed in the given quotes. The working state of the catalyst under reaction conditions is emphasized, suggesting that the catalyst's composition and structure may change during the reaction.

The industrial significance of these catalysts stems from their ability to transform cheap, readily available C2-C4 alkanes into more valuable products. The review covers various industrially relevant processes such as aromatization and alkylation.

However, the given excerpts do not provide specific information about oxidative dehydrogenation or supported vanadium oxide catalysts. More detailed information about the mechanisms and efficiency of specific processes would require further examination of the full text.
