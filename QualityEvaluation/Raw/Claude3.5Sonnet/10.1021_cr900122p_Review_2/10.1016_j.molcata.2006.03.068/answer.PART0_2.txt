The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations. The review focuses on acid and bifunctional zeolite catalysts for transforming C2-C4 alkanes into more valuable products. It discusses the mechanisms of activation, reaction schemes, and the nature of active sites.

For metal-exchanged zeolites, the paper compares Zn and Ga/MFI catalysts, suggesting that different metal compositions affect catalytic performance. The working catalyst composition is also highlighted as an important factor.

The review covers specific processes such as hydroisomerization and dehydroisomerization of n-butane, which are influenced by the catalyst type and reaction conditions. Alkylation reactions over Pt or Pd/HMFI and Ga/HMFI catalysts are also discussed, indicating that different metals support different reaction pathways.

While the paper does not specifically address supported vanadium oxides or oxidative dehydrogenation, it does cover various zeolite-catalyzed reactions. The industrial significance of these catalysts is implied by their ability to transform cheap, readily available alkanes into more valuable products.

However, the review does not provide detailed information on how specific reaction conditions influence the mechanisms and efficiency of these transformations. More research would be needed to fully address all aspects of the question, particularly regarding supported vanadium oxides and oxidative dehydrogenation processes.
