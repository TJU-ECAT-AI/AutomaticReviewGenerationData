[1] "γ -Al2O3-supported vanadium oxide catalysts (06.3 wt% V atoms) were prepared, characterized, and tested for the oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of both ethane and n-butane."

[2] "While the catalytic activity in the ODH reactions increases with the vanadium loading, the selectivity to the corresponding olefins shows a maximum for catalysts with 34 wt% V atoms."

[3] "Associated VO4 tetrahedra were observed by 51V-NMR on catalysts with V loading lower than 5 wt%, while VO6 octahedra were predominant on catalysts with higher V loading."

[4] "Although catalysts with octahedral V5+ species show higher catalytic activity, higher selectivity to oxydehydrogenation reactions was achieved on catalysts in which mainly tetrahedral V5+ species were observed."

[5] "The number and nature of the acid sites also change with the vanadium loading. Thus, Lewis acid sites were observed mainly on catalysts with low V loading, while both Lewis and Brnsted acid sites were observed on catalysts with high V loading."

[6] "Although V5+ species were observed mainly on calcined samples, V4+ species are observed on tested catalysts and their concentration depends on the alkane conversions used in the catalytic tests."

The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of supported vanadium oxide catalysts significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations, particularly in oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) processes:

1. Composition: The vanadium loading on γ-Al2O3 support affects catalytic behavior. Catalysts with 3-4 wt% V atoms show maximum selectivity to olefins, while higher loadings increase overall catalytic activity.

2. Structure: The vanadium species' structure changes with loading. Lower loadings (<5 wt%) feature associated VO4 tetrahedra, while higher loadings show predominant VO6 octahedra. Tetrahedral V5+ species provide higher selectivity for ODH reactions, while octahedral V5+ species offer higher overall catalytic activity.

3. Acid sites: Vanadium loading influences the number and nature of acid sites. Low V loading results in mainly Lewis acid sites, while high V loading produces both Lewis and Brønsted acid sites.

4. Oxidation state: Although V5+ species are predominant in calcined samples, V4+ species form during catalytic tests, with their concentration depending on alkane conversion levels.

5. Reaction conditions: The study focused on ODH of ethane and n-butane using low alkane/oxygen ratios, which affects the catalytic performance and species present on the catalyst surface.

These factors contribute to the industrial significance of supported vanadium oxide catalysts by allowing for tunable selectivity and activity in alkane transformation processes. The ability to control the vanadium species' structure and oxidation state, as well as the nature of acid sites, enables the optimization of catalyst performance for specific reactions and desired products.

支持的钒氧化物催化剂的组成、结构和反应条件显著影响烷烃转化的机理和效率，特别是在氧化脱氢(ODH)过程中：

1. 组成：γ-Al2O3载体上的钒负载量影响催化行为。含3-4 wt%钒原子的催化剂对烯烃的选择性最高，而更高的负载量会增加整体催化活性。

2. 结构：钒物种的结构随负载量变化。较低负载量（<5 wt%）呈现相关的VO4四面体，而较高负载量则以VO6八面体为主。四面体V5+物种提供更高的ODH反应选择性，而八面体V5+物种提供更高的整体催化活性。

3. 酸性位点：钒负载量影响酸性位点的数量和性质。低钒负载主要产生路易斯酸位点，而高钒负载产生路易斯和布朗斯特酸位点。

4. 氧化态：虽然在煅烧样品中V5+物种占主导地位，但在催化测试过程中形成V4+物种，其浓度取决于烷烃转化水平。

5. 反应条件：研究集中在使用低烷烃/氧气比率进行乙烷和正丁烷的ODH，这影响催化性能和催化剂表面存在的物种。

这些因素通过允许在烷烃转化过程中调节选择性和活性，为支持的钒氧化物催化剂的工业重要性做出贡献。控制钒物种结构和氧化态以及酸性位点性质的能力，使得可以针对特定反应和所需产品优化催化剂性能。
