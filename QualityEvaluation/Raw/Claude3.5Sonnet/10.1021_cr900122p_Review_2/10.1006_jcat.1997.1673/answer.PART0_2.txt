[1] "γ -Al2O3-supported vanadium oxide catalysts (06.3 wt% V atoms) were prepared, characterized, and tested for the oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of both ethane and n-butane."

[2] "The vanadium loading strongly influences the catalytic behavior of γ -Al2O3-supported vanadium oxide catalysts during the ODH of n-butane and ethane."

[3] "While the catalytic activity in the ODH reactions increases with the vanadium loading, the selectivity to the corresponding olefins shows a maximum for catalysts with 34 wt% V atoms."

[4] "Associated VO4 tetrahedra were observed by 51V-NMR on catalysts with V loading lower than 5 wt%, while VO6 octahedra were predominant on catalysts with higher V loading."

[5] "Although catalysts with octahedral V5+ species show higher catalytic activity, higher selectivity to oxydehydrogenation reactions was achieved on catalysts in which mainly tetrahedral V5+ species were observed."

[6] "The number and nature of the acid sites also change with the vanadium loading. Thus, Lewis acid sites were observed mainly on catalysts with low V loading, while both Lewis and Brnsted acid sites were observed on catalysts with high V loading."

[7] "Although V5+ species were observed mainly on calcined samples, V4+ species are observed on tested catalysts and their concentration depends on the alkane conversions used in the catalytic tests."

The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of supported vanadium oxide catalysts significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations, particularly in oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) processes. Key factors include:

1. Vanadium loading: The amount of vanadium strongly affects catalytic behavior. Higher vanadium loading increases catalytic activity but optimal selectivity for olefins is achieved at 3-4 wt% V atoms.

2. Vanadium species structure: At lower loadings (<5 wt%), associated VO4 tetrahedra are predominant, while at higher loadings, VO6 octahedra become more common. Tetrahedral V5+ species show higher selectivity for oxydehydrogenation, while octahedral V5+ species exhibit higher overall catalytic activity.

3. Acid sites: The number and nature of acid sites change with vanadium loading. Low loadings feature mainly Lewis acid sites, while higher loadings have both Lewis and Brønsted acid sites.

4. Oxidation state: While V5+ species are mainly observed in calcined samples, V4+ species form during catalytic tests, with their concentration depending on alkane conversion levels.

5. Support material: The study focuses on γ-Al2O3 as a support, which influences the dispersion and properties of vanadium species.

6. Reaction conditions: Factors such as temperature (450-600°C) and feed composition (ethane/oxygen/helium molar ratio of 4/8/88) affect the catalytic performance.

These factors contribute to the industrial significance of supported vanadium oxide catalysts by allowing for tunable activity and selectivity in alkane transformation processes, particularly in the production of olefins through oxidative dehydrogenation.

负载型钒氧化物催化剂的组成、结构和反应条件显著影响烷烃转化的机理和效率，特别是在氧化脱氢（ODH）过程中。主要因素包括：

1. 钒负载量：钒的含量强烈影响催化行为。更高的钒负载量增加催化活性，但最佳烯烃选择性在3-4 wt%钒原子时达到。

2. 钒物种结构：在较低负载量（<5 wt%）时，以关联的VO4四面体为主，而在较高负载量时，VO6八面体更为常见。四面体V5+物种表现出更高的氧化脱氢选择性，而八面体V5+物种则表现出更高的整体催化活性。

3. 酸性位点：酸性位点的数量和性质随钒负载量变化。低负载量主要表现为路易斯酸位点，而高负载量则同时具有路易斯酸和布朗斯特酸位点。

4. 氧化态：虽然在煅烧样品中主要观察到V5+物种，但在催化测试过程中会形成V4+物种，其浓度取决于烷烃转化水平。

5. 载体材料：研究主要关注γ-Al2O3作为载体，它影响钒物种的分散和性质。

6. 反应条件：温度（450-600°C）和进料组成（乙烷/氧气/氦气摩尔比为4/8/88）等因素影响催化性能。

这些因素通过允许在烷烃转化过程中调节活性和选择性，特别是通过氧化脱氢生产烯烃，从而促进了负载型钒氧化物催化剂的工业重要性。
