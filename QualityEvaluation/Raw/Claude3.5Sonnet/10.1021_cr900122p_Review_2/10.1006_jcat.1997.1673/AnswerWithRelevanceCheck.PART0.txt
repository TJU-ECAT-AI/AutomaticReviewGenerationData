          [1] "γ -Al2O3-supported vanadium oxide catalysts (06.3 wt% V atoms) were prepared, characterized, and tested for the oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of both ethane and n-butane."

[2] "While the catalytic activity in the ODH reactions increases with the vanadium loading, the selectivity to the corresponding olefins shows a maximum for catalysts with 34 wt% V atoms."

[3] "Associated VO4 tetrahedra were observed by 51V-NMR on catalysts with V loading lower than 5 wt%, while VO6 octahedra were predominant on catalysts with higher V loading."

[4] "Although catalysts with octahedral V5+ species show higher catalytic activity, higher selectivity to oxydehydrogenation reactions was achieved on catalysts in which mainly tetrahedral V5+ species were observed."

[5] "The number and nature of the acid sites also change with the vanadium loading. Thus, Lewis acid sites were observed mainly on catalysts with low V loading, while both Lewis and Brnsted acid sites were observed on catalysts with high V loading."

[6] "Although V5+ species were observed mainly on calcined samples, V4+ species are observed on tested catalysts and their concentration depends on the alkane conversions used in the catalytic tests."

[7] "The reaction was studied in the temperature interval 450600C using an ethane/oxygen/helium molar ratio of 4/8/88."

          The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts, particularly supported vanadium oxides, significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations in oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) processes:

1. Composition: Vanadium loading (0-6.3 wt% V atoms) on γ-Al2O3 support affects catalytic behavior. Higher vanadium loading increases catalytic activity, while optimal selectivity for olefins is achieved at 3-4 wt% V atoms.

2. Structure: Vanadium species structure changes with loading. Lower loadings (<5 wt%) feature associated VO4 tetrahedra, while higher loadings have predominant VO6 octahedra. Tetrahedral V5+ species show higher selectivity for ODH reactions, while octahedral V5+ species exhibit higher overall catalytic activity.

3. Acid sites: The number and nature of acid sites change with vanadium loading. Low loadings feature mainly Lewis acid sites, while higher loadings have both Lewis and Brønsted acid sites.

4. Oxidation state: V5+ species are mainly observed in calcined samples, but V4+ species form during catalytic tests, with their concentration depending on alkane conversion levels.

5. Reaction conditions: The study used temperatures between 450-600°C and an ethane/oxygen/helium molar ratio of 4/8/88 for ODH reactions.

These factors contribute to the industrial significance of supported vanadium oxide catalysts by allowing for tunable activity and selectivity in alkane transformation processes, particularly in the production of olefins through ODH reactions. The ability to control vanadium loading, species structure, and acid site characteristics enables optimization of catalyst performance for specific reactions and desired products.

          金属基催化剂，特别是负载型钒氧化物的组成、结构和反应条件，显著影响烷烃转化在氧化脱氢（ODH）过程中的机理和效率：

1. 组成：γ-Al2O3载体上的钒负载量（0-6.3 wt%钒原子）影响催化行为。更高的钒负载量增加催化活性，而3-4 wt%钒原子时达到最佳烯烃选择性。

2. 结构：钒物种的结构随负载量变化。较低负载量（<5 wt%）呈现关联的VO4四面体，而较高负载量则以VO6八面体为主。四面体V5+物种对ODH反应表现出更高的选择性，而八面体V5+物种则表现出更高的整体催化活性。

3. 酸性位点：酸性位点的数量和性质随钒负载量变化。低负载量主要表现为路易斯酸位点，而高负载量则同时具有路易斯酸和布朗斯特酸位点。

4. 氧化态：在煅烧样品中主要观察到V5+物种，但在催化测试过程中会形成V4+物种，其浓度取决于烷烃转化水平。

5. 反应条件：研究使用450-600°C的温度范围和4/8/88的乙烷/氧气/氦气摩尔比进行ODH反应。

这些因素通过允许在烷烃转化过程中调节活性和选择性，特别是通过ODH反应生产烯烃，从而促进了负载型钒氧化物催化剂的工业重要性。控制钒负载量、物种结构和酸性位点特性的能力使得可以针对特定反应和所需产品优化催化剂性能。
