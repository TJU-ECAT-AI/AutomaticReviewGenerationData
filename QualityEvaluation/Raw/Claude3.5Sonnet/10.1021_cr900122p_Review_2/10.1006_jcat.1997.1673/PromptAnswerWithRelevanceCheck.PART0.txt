The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts, particularly supported vanadium oxides, significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations in oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) processes.

Composition: The vanadium loading on γ-Al2O3 support affects catalytic behavior. Catalysts with 3-4 wt% V atoms show maximum selectivity to olefins, while higher loadings increase overall catalytic activity.

Structure: The vanadium species' structure changes with loading. Lower loadings (<5 wt%) feature associated VO4 tetrahedra, while higher loadings have predominant VO6 octahedra. Tetrahedral V5+ species show higher selectivity for ODH reactions, while octahedral V5+ species exhibit higher catalytic activity.

Acidity: Vanadium loading affects the number and nature of acid sites. Low V loading catalysts have mainly Lewis acid sites, while high loading catalysts have both Lewis and Brønsted acid sites.

Oxidation state: Although V5+ species are predominant in calcined samples, V4+ species form during catalytic tests, with their concentration dependent on alkane conversion rates.

Reaction conditions: The study used temperatures between 450-600°C and an ethane/oxygen/helium molar ratio of 4/8/88 for ODH reactions.

These factors contribute to the industrial significance of supported vanadium oxide catalysts by allowing for tunable activity and selectivity in alkane transformation processes, particularly in the production of olefins through ODH reactions.

The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of supported vanadium oxide catalysts significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations, particularly in oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) processes. Key factors include:

1. Vanadium loading: The amount of vanadium strongly affects catalytic behavior. Higher vanadium loading increases catalytic activity but optimal selectivity for olefins is achieved at 3-4 wt% V atoms.

2. Vanadium species structure: At lower loadings (<5 wt%), associated VO4 tetrahedra are predominant, while at higher loadings, VO6 octahedra become more common. Tetrahedral V5+ species show higher selectivity for oxydehydrogenation, while octahedral V5+ species exhibit higher overall catalytic activity.

3. Acid sites: The number and nature of acid sites change with vanadium loading. Low loadings feature mainly Lewis acid sites, while higher loadings have both Lewis and Brønsted acid sites.

4. Oxidation state: While V5+ species are mainly observed in calcined samples, V4+ species form during catalytic tests, with their concentration depending on alkane conversion levels.

5. Support material: The study focuses on γ-Al2O3 as a support, which influences the dispersion and properties of vanadium species.

6. Reaction conditions: Factors such as temperature (450-600°C) and feed composition (ethane/oxygen/helium molar ratio of 4/8/88) affect the catalytic performance.

These factors contribute to the industrial significance of supported vanadium oxide catalysts by allowing for tunable activity and selectivity in alkane transformation processes, particularly in the production of olefins through oxidative dehydrogenation.
