[1] "γ -Al2O3-supported vanadium oxide catalysts (06.3 wt% V atoms) were prepared, characterized, and tested for the oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of both ethane and n-butane."

[2] "While the catalytic activity in the ODH reactions increases with the vanadium loading, the selectivity to the corresponding olefins shows a maximum for catalysts with 34 wt% V atoms."

[3] "Associated VO4 tetrahedra were observed by 51V-NMR on catalysts with V loading lower than 5 wt%, while VO6 octahedra were predominant on catalysts with higher V loading."

[4] "Although catalysts with octahedral V5+ species show higher catalytic activity, higher selectivity to oxydehydrogenation reactions was achieved on catalysts in which mainly tetrahedral V5+ species were observed."

[5] "The number and nature of the acid sites also change with the vanadium loading. Thus, Lewis acid sites were observed mainly on catalysts with low V loading, while both Lewis and Brnsted acid sites were observed on catalysts with high V loading."

[6] "Although V5+ species were observed mainly on calcined samples, V4+ species are observed on tested catalysts and their concentration depends on the alkane conversions used in the catalytic tests."

The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of supported vanadium oxide catalysts significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations, particularly in oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) processes:

1. Vanadium loading affects catalytic performance:
- Catalytic activity in ODH reactions increases with vanadium loading
- Selectivity to olefins peaks at 3-4 wt% V atoms

2. Vanadium species structure impacts catalytic properties:
- VO4 tetrahedra predominate at lower V loadings (<5 wt%)
- VO6 octahedra predominate at higher V loadings
- Octahedral V5+ species show higher catalytic activity
- Tetrahedral V5+ species yield higher selectivity in oxydehydrogenation reactions

3. Acid site characteristics change with vanadium loading:
- Low V loading: mainly Lewis acid sites
- High V loading: both Lewis and Brønsted acid sites

4. Oxidation state of vanadium species affects performance:
- V5+ species observed in calcined samples
- V4+ species form during catalytic tests, with concentration depending on alkane conversion

These factors contribute to the industrial significance of supported vanadium oxide catalysts by allowing for tuning of activity and selectivity in alkane transformation processes. The ability to control vanadium loading, species structure, and acid site characteristics enables optimization of catalyst performance for specific reactions and desired products.

负载型钒氧化物催化剂的组成、结构和反应条件显著影响烷烃转化的机理和效率，特别是在氧化脱氢（ODH）过程中：

1. 钒负载量影响催化性能：
- ODH反应的催化活性随钒负载量增加而增加
- 烯烃选择性在3-4 wt%钒原子时达到峰值

2. 钒物种结构影响催化性能：
- 低钒负载量（<5 wt%）时以VO4四面体为主
- 高钒负载量时以VO6八面体为主
- 八面体V5+物种显示更高的催化活性
- 四面体V5+物种在氧化脱氢反应中表现出更高的选择性

3. 酸位特性随钒负载量变化：
- 低钒负载量：主要是路易斯酸位
- 高钒负载量：同时存在路易斯酸位和布朗斯特酸位

4. 钒物种的氧化态影响性能：
- 焙烧样品中观察到V5+物种
- 催化测试过程中形成V4+物种，其浓度取决于烷烃转化率

这些因素通过允许调节烷烃转化过程中的活性和选择性，为负载型钒氧化物催化剂的工业重要性做出贡献。控制钒负载量、物种结构和酸位特性的能力使得可以针对特定反应和所需产品优化催化剂性能。
