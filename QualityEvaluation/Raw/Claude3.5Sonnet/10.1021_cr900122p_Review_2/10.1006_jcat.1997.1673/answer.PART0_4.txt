[1] "γ -Al2O3-supported vanadium oxide catalysts (06.3 wt% V atoms) were prepared, characterized, and tested for the oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of both ethane and n-butane."

[2] "While the catalytic activity in the ODH reactions increases with the vanadium loading, the selectivity to the corresponding olefins shows a maximum for catalysts with 34 wt% V atoms."

[3] "Associated VO4 tetrahedra were observed by 51V-NMR on catalysts with V loading lower than 5 wt%, while VO6 octahedra were predominant on catalysts with higher V loading."

[4] "Although catalysts with octahedral V5+ species show higher catalytic activity, higher selectivity to oxydehydrogenation reactions was achieved on catalysts in which mainly tetrahedral V5+ species were observed."

[5] "The number and nature of the acid sites also change with the vanadium loading. Thus, Lewis acid sites were observed mainly on catalysts with low V loading, while both Lewis and Brnsted acid sites were observed on catalysts with high V loading."

[6] "Although V5+ species were observed mainly on calcined samples, V4+ species are observed on tested catalysts and their concentration depends on the alkane conversions used in the catalytic tests."

[7] "The reaction was studied in the temperature interval 450600C using an ethane/oxygen/helium molar ratio of 4/8/88."

The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of supported vanadium oxide catalysts significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations, particularly in oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) processes:

1. Composition: The vanadium loading (0-6.3 wt% V atoms) affects catalytic activity and selectivity. Activity increases with vanadium loading, while selectivity to olefins peaks at 3-4 wt% V atoms.

2. Structure: At lower V loadings (<5 wt%), associated VO4 tetrahedra are predominant, while at higher loadings, VO6 octahedra dominate. Tetrahedral V5+ species show higher selectivity for ODH reactions, while octahedral V5+ species exhibit higher catalytic activity.

3. Acid sites: The number and nature of acid sites change with vanadium loading. Low V loading catalysts have mainly Lewis acid sites, while high V loading catalysts have both Lewis and Brønsted acid sites.

4. Oxidation state: Although V5+ species are observed in calcined samples, V4+ species form during catalytic tests, with their concentration depending on alkane conversion.

5. Reaction conditions: ODH of ethane was studied at 450-600°C using an ethane/oxygen/helium molar ratio of 4/8/88.

These factors contribute to the industrial significance of supported vanadium oxide catalysts by allowing for tunable activity and selectivity in alkane transformation processes, particularly in the production of olefins through ODH reactions.

负载型钒氧化物催化剂的组成、结构和反应条件显著影响烷烃转化的机理和效率，特别是在氧化脱氢（ODH）过程中：

1. 组成：钒负载量（0-6.3 wt% V原子）影响催化活性和选择性。随着钒负载量的增加，活性增加，而对烯烃的选择性在3-4 wt% V原子时达到峰值。

2. 结构：在较低的V负载量（<5 wt%）下，主要是相关联的VO4四面体，而在较高负载量下，VO6八面体占主导地位。四面体V5+物种对ODH反应表现出更高的选择性，而八面体V5+物种表现出更高的催化活性。

3. 酸性位点：酸性位点的数量和性质随钒负载量而变化。低V负载量催化剂主要具有路易斯酸位点，而高V负载量催化剂同时具有路易斯酸和布朗斯特酸位点。

4. 氧化态：虽然在煅烧样品中观察到V5+物种，但在催化测试过程中形成V4+物种，其浓度取决于烷烃转化率。

5. 反应条件：乙烷的ODH研究在450-600°C下进行，使用乙烷/氧气/氦气的摩尔比为4/8/88。

这些因素通过允许在烷烃转化过程中调节活性和选择性，特别是通过ODH反应生产烯烃，从而促进了负载型钒氧化物催化剂的工业重要性。
