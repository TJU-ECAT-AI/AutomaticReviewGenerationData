          [1] "In general, in propane ODH catalysts made of Voxide supported on silica are more selective than those made with the alumina support, and the latter are more selective than those supported on titania, mainly because of the lower extent of parallel propane combustion, especially at low vanadia loading"

[2] "The reduction and catalytic properties of active VOx domains can be significantly affected by the formation of binary dispersed structures. For example, VOx-CrOx and VOx-MoOx mixed structures lead to a higher propane ODH rate and selectivity than VOx domains present at similar surface densities on pure Al2O3 supports"

[3] "The activation of the ethane CH bond proceeds through the formation of alkoxides, which decompose to ethylene and a surface OH group or are oxidized to surface-bound oxygenates (acetaldehyde)."

[4] "A key factor in the design of efficient catalysts for alkane ODH is the isolation of active sites. Therefore, the isomorphous substitution of active metal species, e.g., vanadium, into microporous and mesoporous materials is an attractive strategy for designing new catalysts for this reaction"

[5] "In the case of VCoAPO-18, the presence of both acid sites (related to the presence of Co2+ cations) and redox sites (related to the presence of V5+/4+ and Co3+/2+) seems to be an important factor in achieving high selectivities to ethylene during the ODH of ethane"

[6] "The catalytic activity of vanadium oxide catalysts increases with the V2O5 loading, while rates per V-atom reach a maximum on VOx domains of intermediate size, providing a balance between the activity of surface VOx species and their accessibility to reactants."

[7] "For both propane and ethane, reactivity data for catalysts made of supported vanadium oxide are consistent both with kinetically relevant steps involving the dissociation of CH bonds (methylenic C atom in propane) and with a Mars-van Krevelen redox mechanism involving lattice oxygen in CH bond activation."

[8] "One of the best performing catalysts in propane ODH is the VOx-SBA-15 system, prepared by an alcoholic impregnation method, in which the introduction of V species onto the inner walls of SBA-15 provides a system with a large concentration of accessible, isolated and structurally well-defined active sites."

[9] "The selectivity to propylene formation is affected by surface reduction: the higher the surface reduction, the higher the selectivity"

[10] "Additives (e.g., P, K, Ca, Ni, Cr, Nb, Mg, Au, Zn and Mo), sometimes added in relevant amount with respect to V, modify acidbasic and redox properties of supported vanadium oxide"

[11] "Examples include V-containing high-surface siliceous materials, such as MCM-41, MCM-48 or SBA-15. In these systems, the catalytic activity of vanadium is strongly influenced by its local environment and the co-existence of acid sites in the host material."

          The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations, particularly in oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) processes:

1. Catalyst composition:
   - Support material affects selectivity: silica > alumina > titania for propane ODH.
   - V2O5 loading impacts catalytic activity, with optimal performance at intermediate loadings.
   - Binary dispersed structures (e.g., VOx-CrOx, VOx-MoOx) can enhance ODH rate and selectivity.
   - Additives (P, K, Ca, Ni, Cr, Nb, Mg, Au, Zn, Mo) modify acid-base and redox properties.

2. Catalyst structure:
   - Isolation of active sites is crucial for efficient ODH catalysts.
   - Isomorphous substitution of active metals into microporous and mesoporous materials (e.g., MCM-41, MCM-48, SBA-15) is an effective design strategy.
   - VOx-SBA-15 system provides high concentration of accessible, isolated, and well-defined active sites.

3. Reaction mechanism:
   - Follows Mars-van Krevelen redox mechanism involving lattice oxygen in C-H bond activation.
   - Ethane ODH proceeds through alkoxide formation, decomposing to ethylene or oxidizing to oxygenates.

4. Surface properties:
   - Higher surface reduction leads to higher selectivity for propylene formation.
   - Balance between activity and accessibility of surface VOx species is important.

5. Dual functionality:
   - Presence of both acid sites and redox sites (e.g., in VCoAPO-18) contributes to high ethylene selectivity in ethane ODH.

These factors contribute to the industrial significance of metal-based catalysts by allowing fine-tuning of catalytic properties to optimize yield, selectivity, and efficiency in alkane transformation processes.

          金属基催化剂的组成、结构和反应条件显著影响烷烃转化的机理和效率，特别是在氧化脱氢（ODH）过程中：

1. 催化剂组成：
   - 载体材料影响选择性：丙烷ODH中，二氧化硅 > 氧化铝 > 二氧化钛。
   - V2O5负载量影响催化活性，中等负载量时性能最佳。
   - 二元分散结构（如VOx-CrOx，VOx-MoOx）可提高ODH速率和选择性。
   - 添加剂（P、K、Ca、Ni、Cr、Nb、Mg、Au、Zn、Mo）可改变酸碱性和氧化还原性。

2. 催化剂结构：
   - 活性位点的隔离对高效ODH催化剂至关重要。
   - 将活性金属同构替代到微孔和介孔材料（如MCM-41、MCM-48、SBA-15）中是有效的设计策略。
   - VOx-SBA-15系统提供高浓度的可及、隔离和结构明确的活性位点。

3. 反应机理：
   - 遵循Mars-van Krevelen氧化还原机理，涉及晶格氧参与C-H键活化。
   - 乙烷ODH通过烷氧基形成进行，分解成乙烯或氧化成含氧化合物。

4. 表面性质：
   - 表面还原程度越高，丙烯形成的选择性越高。
   - 表面VOx物种的活性和可及性之间的平衡很重要。

5. 双重功能性：
   - 酸性位点和氧化还原位点的共同存在（如在VCoAPO-18中）有助于乙烷ODH中获得高乙烯选择性。

这些因素通过允许对催化性能进行微调以优化烷烃转化过程中的产率、选择性和效率，从而提高了金属基催化剂的工业重要性。
