          [1] "It has been found that, when propane is used as the reactant at 5OOC and 0.1 MPa, the BTX selectivity can be increased from ca. 10% (H-ZSM-5) to ca. 40 to 45% after treatment of the base zeolite with solutions of zinc or gallium nitrate, such that the final zinc or gallium content is ca. 1.0 mass-%."

[2] "On Zn-ZSM-5 part of the hydrogen atom pool lost on aromatization is released as dihydrogen and an improved BTX selectivity results."

[3] "It appears that Ga-ZSM-5 or GaZn-ZSM-5 catalysts operate in a similar manner, but gallium-containing samples are preferred since zinc volatilization occurs at the reaction temperatures used for samples containing zinc alone."

[4] "The contact time has been shown to have a strong influence on the product distribution obtained in these systems. To summarize, the observed selectivity to aromatics depends on the form of the zeolite used and on the contact time."

[5] "A comparative study of the conversion of propane, n-butane and i-butane over Zn-ZSM-5 reveals that the alkanes differ in terms of activity and BTX selectivity. i-Butane is the most reactive of the three alkanes and also yields the highest percentage hydrogen recovery as dihydrogen. However, it displays the lowest BTX selectivity."

          The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations, particularly in zeolite-catalyzed reactions such as the conversion of light alkanes to aromatics (BTX).

Composition: Adding metals like zinc or gallium (around 1.0 mass-%) to H-ZSM-5 zeolites increases BTX selectivity from about 10% to 40-45% for propane conversion at 500°C and 0.1 MPa. Gallium-containing catalysts are preferred over zinc-containing ones due to zinc volatilization at high temperatures.

Structure: ZSM-5 type zeolites are effective for this transformation. The metal component (Zn or Ga) is introduced by treating H-ZSM-5 with aqueous solutions of the respective metal nitrate.

Reaction conditions: Temperature (typically 500°C) and pressure (0.1 MPa) affect the process. Contact time strongly influences product distribution and aromatics selectivity.

Mechanism: On Zn-ZSM-5 and Ga-ZSM-5, part of the hydrogen lost during aromatization is released as dihydrogen, improving BTX selectivity. Different alkanes (propane, n-butane, i-butane) show varying activities and BTX selectivities.

Industrial significance: These catalysts allow for tunable selectivity and improved yields of desired aromatic products from light alkanes, which is important for upgrading lower-value hydrocarbons. The ability to convert light alkanes to more valuable aromatic compounds (BTX) is industrially important, making these processes more economically viable for industrial applications.

          金属基催化剂的组成、结构和反应条件显著影响烷烃转化的机理和效率，特别是在沸石催化反应中，如轻烷烃转化为芳烃（BTX）的过程。

组成：向H-ZSM-5沸石中添加锌或镓等金属（约1.0质量百分比）可以将丙烷转化的BTX选择性从约10%提高到40-45%（在500°C和0.1 MPa条件下）。由于锌在高温下易挥发，含镓催化剂比含锌催化剂更受青睐。

结构：ZSM-5型沸石对这种转化很有效。金属组分（Zn或Ga）是通过用相应金属硝酸盐的水溶液处理H-ZSM-5引入的。

反应条件：温度（通常为500°C）和压力（0.1 MPa）影响该过程。接触时间强烈影响产品分布和芳烃选择性。

机理：在Zn-ZSM-5和Ga-ZSM-5上，芳构化过程中失去的部分氢以二氢的形式释放，改善了BTX选择性。不同的烷烃（丙烷、正丁烷、异丁烷）表现出不同的活性和BTX选择性。

工业重要性：这些催化剂允许可调节的选择性，并从轻烷烃中获得所需芳香族产物的改进产率，这对于提升低价值烃类很重要。将轻烷烃转化为更有价值的芳烃化合物（BTX）的能力在工业上很重要，使这些过程在工业应用中更具经济可行性。
