          [1] "Besides oxidative activation such as oxidative coupling of methane to C2+, non-oxidative activation of methane to produce aromatics over Mo/HZSM-5 catalysts in a continuous flow mode has attracted significant interest since 1993."

[2] "The catalysts and reaction conditions are presented. Emphasis has been focused on the modification of catalysts and optimization of reaction conditions."

[3] "The channel structure and acidity of HZSM-5 zeolite and the valence and location of Mo species are the crucial factors for the catalytic performance"

[4] "Generally speaking, the channel structure and acidity of the HZSM-5 and the valence and location of the Mo species on/in the zeolite are crucial factors for its catalytic performance."

[5] "The induction period of the reaction is commonly recognized, in which Mo6+ species possibly located on the external surface of the support are partially reduced or reduced to Mo2C, mainly yielding H2O, CO, CO2 and H2."

[6] "All the experiments showed that various pre-treatments and different reaction conditions, such as pre-treatment atmosphere [25,29,38] and temperature [28,36,40], reaction temperature [25,29], pressure [19,43], methane space velocity [24,25,28,43], and regeneration [25,36], exerted great influences on the catalytic performance."

          The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts, particularly Mo/HZSM-5, significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations, especially in methane dehydro-aromatization. Key factors include:

1. Catalyst composition: The use of Mo as the active metal component on HZSM-5 zeolite support is crucial for methane activation and conversion to aromatics.

2. Zeolite structure: The channel structure of HZSM-5 plays a vital role in the catalytic performance, affecting the distribution and accessibility of active sites.

3. Acidity: The acidity of the HZSM-5 support is essential for the catalytic process.

4. Metal valence and location: The oxidation state of Mo and its distribution on the zeolite surface or within the channels significantly impact catalyst performance.

5. Preparation conditions: Calcination temperature affects the interaction between Mo species and acid sites, as well as the migration of Mo into zeolite channels.

6. Reaction conditions: Optimization of parameters such as temperature, pressure, methane space velocity, and catalyst regeneration is crucial for improving catalyst efficiency.

7. Reaction mechanism: The process involves an induction period where Mo6+ species are reduced to lower oxidation states or Mo2C, followed by methane activation and transformation to aromatics.

These factors contribute to the industrial significance of Mo/HZSM-5 catalysts by enabling the direct conversion of methane to valuable aromatic products under non-oxidative conditions, which has attracted considerable interest since 1993 due to its potential for natural gas utilization.

          金属基催化剂的组成、结构和反应条件，特别是Mo/HZSM-5，显著影响烷烃转化的机理和效率，尤其是在甲烷脱氢芳构化过程中。关键因素包括：

1. 催化剂组成：使用Mo作为活性金属组分，HZSM-5沸石作为载体，对甲烷活化和转化为芳烃至关重要。

2. 沸石结构：HZSM-5的通道结构在催化性能中起着至关重要的作用，影响活性位的分布和可及性。

3. 酸性：HZSM-5载体的酸性对催化过程至关重要。

4. 金属价态和位置：Mo的氧化态及其在沸石表面或通道内的分布显著影响催化剂性能。

5. 制备条件：焙烧温度影响Mo物种与酸位的相互作用，以及Mo向沸石通道的迁移。

6. 反应条件：优化温度、压力、甲烷空速和催化剂再生等参数对提高催化剂效率至关重要。

7. 反应机理：该过程涉及一个诱导期，其中Mo6+物种被还原为较低氧化态或Mo2C，随后进行甲烷活化和向芳烃的转化。

这些因素通过实现在非氧化条件下直接将甲烷转化为有价值的芳烃产品，为Mo/HZSM-5催化剂的工业重要性做出贡献。由于其在天然气利用方面的潜力，自1993年以来，这一领域已引起了相当大的兴趣。
