          [1] "Depending on the vanadium loadings, different vanadium oxide species (V5+) were formed on the surface of alumina after calcination. Mainly isolated and polymerized VO4 units were observed at coverages up to a monolayer [1,5,13] while VO6 octahedra were predominant on catalyst surfaces at higher vanadium loadings [1]."

[2] "The molecular structure of the surface vanadium oxide species and the catalytic properties are influenced by the method of preparation, the nature of support, promotors and environmental conditions [1]."

[3] "It is suggested that both isolated and polymerized tetrahedrally coordinated V5+ species are active in propane dehydrogenation. The AlVO4 phase and bulk-like V2O5 have only a low catalytic activity."

[4] "The highest propene selectivity was obtained for the sample with the highest dispersion of the isolated and polymerized tetrahedrally coordinated V5+ species."

[5] "Propene selectivity depends on the dispersion of the tetrahedrally coordinated V5+ species; the higher the dispersion, the higher the propene selectivity. CO is the main product of propene oxidation and its formation increases with decreasing dispersion of active sites."

[6] "Vanadium species formed on the alumina support after calcination between 773 and 973 K at vanadium loadings between 4.45 and 13.2 wt.% were characterized with different methods (51V NMR, ESR, H2-TPR and in situ UVvis-DRS) and tested in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane."

[7] "By calcination at 873 K, beside dispersed isolated and polymerized V5+ surface species mainly in tetrahedral coordination, a crystalline AlVO4 phase was formed. The portion of vanadium present as AlVO4 increases with increasing vanadium loadings (e.g. about 60 at 13.2 wt.%)."

[8] "Initial propane reaction rate (Table 5) has the highest values for the samples V(8.9/773), V(4.5/873) and V(8.9/873). In these samples, dispersed isolated and polymerized tetrahedrally coordinated V5+ species dominate."

          The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of supported vanadium oxide catalysts significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations, particularly in oxidative dehydrogenation processes. Key factors include:

1. Vanadium loading: Different vanadium oxide species form on the alumina surface depending on the loading. At low coverages, isolated and polymerized VO4 units dominate, while at higher loadings, VO6 octahedra become predominant.

2. Calcination temperature: Temperatures between 773-973 K affect the formation and distribution of different vanadium species. At 873 K, beside dispersed isolated and polymerized V5+ surface species, a crystalline AlVO4 phase forms.

3. Preparation method, support nature, promoters, and environmental conditions: These factors influence the molecular structure of surface vanadium oxide species and their catalytic properties.

4. Active species: Both isolated and polymerized tetrahedrally coordinated V5+ species are active in propane dehydrogenation. The AlVO4 phase and bulk-like V2O5 have low catalytic activity.

5. Dispersion: Higher dispersion of isolated and polymerized tetrahedrally coordinated V5+ species leads to higher propene selectivity. As dispersion decreases, CO formation (the main byproduct) increases.

6. Reaction conditions: Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane was used as a test reaction to evaluate catalyst performance.

These factors contribute to the industrial significance of supported vanadium oxide catalysts by influencing their activity, selectivity, and overall efficiency in alkane transformation processes. The ability to control and optimize these parameters allows for the development of more effective catalysts for industrial applications.

          负载型钒氧化物催化剂的组成、结构和反应条件显著影响烷烃转化的机理和效率，特别是在氧化脱氢过程中。关键因素包括：

1. 钒负载量：不同的钒负载量导致在氧化铝表面形成不同的钒氧化物物种。在低覆盖度下，以孤立和聚合的VO4单元为主，而在高负载量下，VO6八面体结构占主导地位。

2. 焙烧温度：773-973 K之间的温度影响不同钒物种的形成和分布。在873 K下，除了分散的孤立和聚合V5+表面物种外，还形成了结晶的AlVO4相。

3. 制备方法、载体性质、助剂和环境条件：这些因素影响表面钒氧化物的分子结构及其催化性能。

4. 活性物种：四面体配位的孤立和聚合V5+物种在丙烷脱氢中都具有活性。AlVO4相和类块状V2O5具有较低的催化活性。

5. 分散度：四面体配位的孤立和聚合V5+物种的分散度越高，丙烯选择性越高。随着分散度降低，CO的形成（主要副产品）增加。

6. 反应条件：使用丙烷的氧化脱氢作为测试反应来评估催化剂性能。

这些因素通过影响催化剂在烷烃转化过程中的活性、选择性和整体效率，促进了负载型钒氧化物催化剂的工业重要性。能够控制和优化这些参数允许开发出更有效的工业应用催化剂。
