          [1] "The catalytic dehydrocondensation of methane to benzene and naphthalene with a bulky of hydrogen on transition metal supported zeolite catalysts is one of strategies for the catalytic conversion of methane and a challenging topic in heterogeneous catalysis."

[2] "Wang et al. [11] reported that methane could be transformed to benzene in a flow mode reactor on transition metal ions supported HZSM-5 catalysts under non-oxidative condition."

[3] "It is generally accepted that the Mo/HZSM-5 is one of the good catalysts as reported by groups of Xu and co-workers [13,14], Chen et al. [15], Solymosi et al. [1619], Wang et al. [20,21], and Liu et al. [22,23]."

[4] "Weckhuysen et al. [26] studied the effect of transition metal ions, the preparation and treatment method. They found that the activity is in the following sequence: Mo > W > Fe > V > Cr."

[5] "Zhang et al. studied the methane aromatization over Mo-based catalysts supported on different types of zeolites [32]. It was found that H-type silicaalumina zeolites, such as ZSM-5, ZSM-8, ZSM-11 and β-zeolite, were effective supports for Mo-based catalysts"

[6] "During the past 8 years, the catalyst modification in term of zeolite micropores was extensively studied [23,3237]. Some of typical results are listed in Table 1."

          The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations, particularly in processes like methane dehydrocondensation to aromatics. 

For methane conversion to benzene and naphthalene, transition metal ions supported on zeolite catalysts play a crucial role. Mo/HZSM-5 is widely recognized as an effective catalyst, with the activity of different transition metals following the order Mo > W > Fe > V > Cr. The choice of metal and zeolite support affects catalyst performance.

The zeolite support structure is important, with H-type silica-alumina zeolites like ZSM-5, ZSM-8, ZSM-11, and β-zeolite being effective supports for Mo-based catalysts. Zeolite micropore structure has been extensively studied and modified to improve catalyst performance.

Reaction conditions such as temperature, flow mode, and non-oxidative environments impact the conversion process. The industrial significance of these catalysts stems from their ability to directly convert methane, a major component of natural gas, into more valuable aromatic compounds like benzene and naphthalene under non-oxidative conditions. This process is challenging but important for utilizing natural gas resources as crude oil reserves decline.

Ongoing research focuses on improving catalyst activity, selectivity, and stability through modifications in metal composition, zeolite structure, and reaction conditions, which are crucial factors for potential industrial applications.

          金属基催化剂的组成、结构和反应条件显著影响烷烃转化的机理和效率，特别是在甲烷脱氢缩合生成芳烃等过程中。

对于甲烷转化为苯和萘的反应，负载在分子筛催化剂上的过渡金属离子起着关键作用。Mo/HZSM-5被广泛认为是有效的催化剂，不同过渡金属的活性顺序为Mo > W > Fe > V > Cr。金属和分子筛载体的选择影响催化剂性能。

分子筛载体结构很重要，ZSM-5、ZSM-8、ZSM-11和β分子筛等H型硅铝分子筛是Mo基催化剂的有效载体。分子筛微孔结构已被广泛研究和改进，以提高催化剂性能。

温度、流动模式和非氧化环境等反应条件影响转化过程。这些催化剂的工业意义在于它们能够在非氧化条件下直接将天然气的主要成分甲烷转化为更有价值的芳香族化合物如苯和萘。这个过程具有挑战性，但对于在原油储量下降的情况下利用天然气资源非常重要。

当前研究致力于通过改进金属组成、分子筛结构和反应条件来提高催化剂的活性、选择性和稳定性，这些是潜在工业应用的关键因素。
