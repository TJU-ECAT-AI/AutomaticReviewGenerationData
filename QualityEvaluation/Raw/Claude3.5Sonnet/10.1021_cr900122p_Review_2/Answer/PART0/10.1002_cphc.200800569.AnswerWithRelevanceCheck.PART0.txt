          [1] "Zn- or Ga-modified zeolites effectively catalyze the conversion of light alkanes to aromatics with high selectivity."

[2] "The role of the metal species and acid sites of a zeolite in the enhancement of light alkane conversion to aromatics remains a subject of intense controversy, even after significant emphasis and numerous publications."

[3] "There is agreement on the bifunctional nature of these catalysts, where the metal species are responsible for the dehydrogenation of alkanes, while the Brnsted acid sites are involved in the oligomerization and cyclization of olefins."

[4] "When zeolites are modified with Zn, the picture of hydrogen exchange changes. Regioselectivity of the exchange is observed on Zn/H-ZSM-5 and Zn/H-BEA for propane and n-butane."

[5] "A significant increase in the reaction rates with lowering apparent activation energies demonstrate the promoting effect of Zn on the reaction of H/D hydrogen exchange for C1n-C4 alkanes."

[6] "The acceleration of H/D exchange, coupled with the decreased activation energy for Zn-modified zeolites, demonstrates that the CH bonds in alkanes break and form more easily and reversibly with intermediate involvement of Zn species."

[7] "The strong influence of Zn on the activation of CH bonds of small alkanes by the zeolite Brnsted sites is achieved by involvement in the exchange of Znalkyl species, whose formation from alkanes precedes its further involvement in interaction with Brnsted acid sites."

          The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts, particularly metal-exchanged zeolites, significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations. Key factors include:

1. Metal modification: Zn- or Ga-modified zeolites enhance the conversion of light alkanes to aromatics with high selectivity.

2. Bifunctional nature: These catalysts have metal species responsible for alkane dehydrogenation and Brønsted acid sites involved in olefin oligomerization and cyclization.

3. Regioselectivity: Zn modification introduces regioselectivity in hydrogen exchange for propane and n-butane on Zn/H-ZSM-5 and Zn/H-BEA zeolites.

4. Reaction kinetics: Zn promotes H/D hydrogen exchange for C1-C4 alkanes, increasing reaction rates and lowering activation energies.

5. C-H bond activation: Zn-alkyl species formation facilitates easier breaking and formation of C-H bonds, interacting with Brønsted acid sites.

These factors contribute to the industrial significance of metal-modified zeolites by improving catalytic performance in alkane transformation processes. The synergistic effect between metal species and acid sites enhances overall efficiency and selectivity, making these catalysts valuable for industrial applications such as the aromatization of light alkanes.

          金属基催化剂，特别是金属交换的沸石，其组成、结构和反应条件显著影响烷烃转化的机理和效率。主要因素包括：

1. 金属改性：锌或镓改性的沸石提高了轻烷烃向芳烃的高选择性转化。

2. 双功能性：这些催化剂具有负责烷烃脱氢的金属物种和参与烯烃寡聚和环化的Brønsted酸位点。

3. 区域选择性：锌改性在Zn/H-ZSM-5和Zn/H-BEA沸石上为丙烷和正丁烷的氢交换引入了区域选择性。

4. 反应动力学：锌促进了C1-C4烷烃的H/D氢交换，提高了反应速率并降低了活化能。

5. C-H键活化：锌-烷基物种的形成促进了C-H键更容易断裂和形成，并与Brønsted酸位点相互作用。

这些因素通过改善烷烃转化过程中的催化性能，提高了金属改性沸石的工业重要性。金属物种和酸性位点之间的协同作用提高了整体效率和选择性，使这些催化剂在轻烷烃芳构化等工业应用中具有重要价值。
