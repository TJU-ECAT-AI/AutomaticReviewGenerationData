          [1] "It has been demonstrated that the nature and the dispersion of the metal oxide phase have a great inuence on the catalysts behavior."

          [2] "Likewise, Irusta et al. [16] demonstrated that the presence of vanadium oxide species with terminal oxygen sites (V=O) is needed for the oxidation to oxygenates whereas the presence of species without terminal V=O sites leads to the formation of complete oxidation products."

          [3] "Three different types of supported tungsten species are present in W/HZSM-5 catalysts: isolated tetrahedral W2^4 species probably grafted to the Bro^nsted acid sites of the zeolite, octahedral polymeric species such as polytungstates and WO3 crystallites."

          [4] "The relative amounts of these three types of species changes significantly with tungsten loading. At low contents of tungsten tetrahedral species predominates and they are mainly located in the channels of the zeolite. For higher loading the amount and the size of the polytungstate species increases gradually causing a decrease in the dispersion and the partial blocking up of the HZMS-5 zeolite."

          [5] "Formaldehyde selectivity seems to be related to the dispersion of the tungsten oxide phase, which, in turn, is influenced by the metal loading."

          [6] "It has been reported that both active oxygen ions and Bro^nsted acidic sites on HZSM-5 are active centers for methane activation"

          [7] "The active centers of the partial oxidation to formaldehyde over W/HZSM-5 are in the supported tungsten oxide phase."

          [8] "HZSM-5 zeolite shows higher activity in methane conversion but does not lead to formaldehyde production."

          The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations, particularly in processes such as oxidative dehydrogenation and zeolite-catalyzed reactions. Key factors include:

          1. Composition and structure: For supported vanadium oxides, the presence of terminal oxygen sites (V=O) is crucial for selective oxidation to oxygenates, while species without these sites lead to complete oxidation. In W/HZSM-5 catalysts, three types of tungsten species exist: isolated tetrahedral species, octahedral polymeric species, and WO3 crystallites. Their relative amounts change with tungsten loading, affecting catalyst performance.

          2. Metal loading and dispersion: Metal loading influences the dispersion of the metal oxide phase, which in turn affects selectivity. For example, formaldehyde selectivity in W/HZSM-5 catalysts is related to the dispersion of the tungsten oxide phase. Higher loading can lead to increased polytungstate species, decreased dispersion, and partial blocking of zeolite pores.

          3. Active sites: Both active oxygen ions and Brønsted acidic sites on HZSM-5 are active centers for methane activation. In W/HZSM-5, the supported tungsten oxide phase contains the active centers for partial oxidation to formaldehyde.

          4. Support acidity: The acidity of the zeolite support plays a role in catalyst performance. HZSM-5 shows higher activity in methane conversion but does not produce formaldehyde, while W/HZSM-5 is active for partial oxidation of methane to formaldehyde.

          These factors contribute to the industrial significance of these catalysts by influencing their activity, selectivity, and overall performance in alkane transformations. The ability to control these parameters allows for the design of catalysts tailored to specific industrial processes, potentially improving efficiency and product yields.

          金属基催化剂的组成、结构和反应条件显著影响烷烃转化的机理和效率，特别是在氧化脱氢和沸石催化反应等过程中。关键因素包括：

          1. 组成和结构：对于负载型钒氧化物，末端氧位点（V=O）的存在对选择性氧化生成含氧化合物至关重要，而不含这些位点的物种会导致完全氧化。在W/HZSM-5催化剂中，存在三种钨物种：孤立的四面体物种、八面体聚合物种和WO3晶体。它们的相对含量随钨负载量的变化而变化，影响催化剂性能。

          2. 金属负载量和分散度：金属负载量影响金属氧化物相的分散度，进而影响选择性。例如，W/HZSM-5催化剂中甲醛的选择性与钨氧化物相的分散度有关。较高的负载量可能导致多钨酸盐物种增加、分散度降低，并部分堵塞沸石孔道。

          3. 活性位点：HZSM-5上的活性氧离子和Brønsted酸性位点都是甲烷活化的活性中心。在W/HZSM-5中，负载的钨氧化物相包含部分氧化生成甲醛的活性中心。

          4. 载体酸性：沸石载体的酸性对催化剂性能起着重要作用。HZSM-5在甲烷转化中显示出更高的活性，但不产生甲醛，而W/HZSM-5对甲烷部分氧化生成甲醛具有活性。

          这些因素通过影响催化剂在烷烃转化中的活性、选择性和整体性能，contribute to了这些催化剂的工业重要性。控制这些参数的能力允许设计出适合特定工业过程的催化剂，潜在地提高效率和产品收率。
