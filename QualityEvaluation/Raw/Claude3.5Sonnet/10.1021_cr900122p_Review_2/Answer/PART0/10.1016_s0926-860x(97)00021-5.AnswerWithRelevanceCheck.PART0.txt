          [1] "Supported vanadium oxide catalysts, containing surface vanadia species on oxide supports, are extensively employed as catalysts for many hydrocarbon oxidation reactions."

[2] "The molecular structures of these surface vanadia species are tentatively thought to consist of a terminal V=O bond and three bridging V-O-support bonds for the isolated species, and a terminal V=O bond with one bridging V-O-support and two bridging V-O-V bonds for the polymerized species."

[3] "The bridging V-O-support bond appears to be associated with the critical oxygen required for hydrocarbon oxidation reactions since changing the specific oxide support dramatically affects the TOF: approximately four orders of magnitude for methanol oxidation to formaldehyde and two-orders of magnitude for butane oxidation to maleic anhydride."

[4] "The general trend appears to be CeOz>ZrO2 TiO2>NbzOs>A12Os>SiO2, which inversely correlates with the Sanderson electronegativity of the oxide support cations."

[5] "As a result of these physical and chemical characteristics, supported vanadia catalysts tend to be among the most active and selective supported metal oxide catalysts for hydrocarbon oxidation reactions."

[6] "The oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propylene over V2O5/Nb2O5 was not dependent on the concentration of the bridging V-O-V bonds"

[7] "Oxidation reactions requiring only one surface vanadia sites are generally not sensitive to the surface vanadia coverage and the presence of noninteracting metal oxide additives. Oxidation reactions requiring multiple surface vanadia sites are very sensitive to surface vanadia coverage and the presence of noninteracting metal oxide additives."

[8] "The addition of surface niobia is especially informative since it has a minimal effect on the surface vanadia structure, see Section 5.6 above, and its presence primarily increases the number of adjacent surface metal oxide sites for the surface vanadia species."

[9] "Interacting additives affect all hydrocarbon oxidation reactions since they directly alter the structure and reactivity of the surface vanadia sites."

[10] "Acidic and basic additives also influence the selectivity of hydrocarbon oxidation reactions, but the effect appears to be reaction specific and cannot be generalized with the limited data currently available."

          The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of supported vanadium oxide catalysts significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations, particularly in oxidative dehydrogenation processes. Key factors contributing to their industrial significance include:

1. Support material: The choice of oxide support (e.g., CeO2, ZrO2, TiO2, Nb2O5, Al2O3, SiO2) dramatically affects catalyst performance. The bridging V-O-support bond is critical, as it can change the turnover frequency (TOF) for hydrocarbon oxidation reactions by up to four orders of magnitude.

2. Surface structure: Surface vanadia species typically consist of isolated species with a terminal V=O bond and three bridging V-O-support bonds, or polymerized species with a terminal V=O bond, one V-O-support bond, and two V-O-V bonds.

3. Support electronegativity: The reactivity trend (CeO2 > ZrO2 > TiO2 > Nb2O5 > Al2O3 > SiO2) inversely correlates with the Sanderson electronegativity of the oxide support cations, affecting the basicity of the bridging oxygens.

4. Surface coverage and additives: The sensitivity to surface vanadia coverage and non-interacting metal oxide additives depends on whether the reaction requires single or multiple surface vanadia sites. For example, the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propylene over V2O5/Nb2O5 was not dependent on the concentration of bridging V-O-V bonds.

5. Interacting additives: These directly alter the structure and reactivity of surface vanadia sites, affecting all hydrocarbon oxidation reactions.

6. Acidic and basic additives: These influence the selectivity of hydrocarbon oxidation reactions, though their effects are reaction-specific and not yet fully understood.

These factors allow for the tuning of catalyst properties to optimize performance in specific alkane transformation processes, contributing to the industrial significance of supported vanadium oxide catalysts. Their unique characteristics make them among the most active and selective supported metal oxide catalysts for hydrocarbon oxidation reactions.

          负载型钒氧化物催化剂的组成、结构和反应条件显著影响烷烃转化的机理和效率，特别是在氧化脱氢过程中。以下是影响其工业重要性的关键因素：

1. 载体材料：氧化物载体的选择（如CeO2、ZrO2、TiO2、Nb2O5、Al2O3、SiO2）极大地影响催化剂性能。桥接V-O-载体键至关重要，它可以使烃类氧化反应的转化频率（TOF）变化高达四个数量级。

2. 表面结构：表面钒物种通常由具有末端V=O键和三个桥接V-O-载体键的孤立物种，或具有末端V=O键、一个V-O-载体键和两个V-O-V键的聚合物种组成。

3. 载体电负性：反应活性趋势（CeO2 > ZrO2 > TiO2 > Nb2O5 > Al2O3 > SiO2）与氧化物载体阳离子的Sanderson电负性呈反相关，影响桥接氧的碱性。

4. 表面覆盖度和添加剂：对表面钒覆盖度和非相互作用金属氧化物添加剂的敏感性取决于反应是需要单个还是多个表面钒位点。例如，V2O5/Nb2O5上丙烷氧化脱氢制丙烯的反应不依赖于桥接V-O-V键的浓度。

5. 相互作用添加剂：这些直接改变表面钒位点的结构和反应性，影响所有碳氢化合物氧化反应。

6. 酸性和碱性添加剂：这些影响碳氢化合物氧化反应的选择性，但它们的影响是特定于反应的，目前还没有完全理解。

这些因素允许调整催化剂性质以优化特定烷烃转化过程的性能，从而促进了负载型钒氧化物催化剂的工业重要性。它们的独特特性使其成为烃类氧化反应中最活跃和选择性最高的负载型金属氧化物催化剂之一。
