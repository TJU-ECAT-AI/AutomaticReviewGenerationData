          [1] "Zn-doped catalysts are well studied and one of them is used in the commercial Cyclar process."

          [2] "Zinc can be introduced to a zeolite by aqueous or solid ion exchange techniques. Action of the ZnCl2 vapour on H-ZSM5 also leads to a Zn-exchanged zeolite."

          [3] "The catalytic activity towards alkane aromatisation is due mainly to the ionic Zn2+ species."

          [4] "The first step of ethane and propane aromatisation in a Zn-doped zeolite catalyst is the dehydrogenation of these alkanes to the corresponding alkenes."

          [5] "The results obtained indicate that the reaction proceeds via a mechanism starting from the alkyl rupture of the ethane C–H bond (C2H5–•H–•), and the zinc cation acts as an acceptor of the alkyl group."

          [6] "The catalytic cycle for the alkyl activation consists of three elementary steps: (i) rupture of ethane C–H bond on the Zn–O–• pair; (ii) formation of ethene from the alkyl group bound to Zn; and (iii) formation of dihydrogen from the Brønsted proton and hydrogen bound to Zn."

          [7] "The selectivity of zeolite catalysts towards aromatisation of small alkanes can be greatly increased by incorporation of zinc or gallium ions."

          The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts, particularly Zn-exchanged zeolites, significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations, especially in processes such as dehydrogenation and aromatization.

          Composition: Zinc can be introduced into zeolites through various methods, including aqueous or solid ion exchange techniques and vapor deposition of ZnCl2 on H-ZSM5. The catalytically active species are primarily ionic Zn2+ cations.

          Structure: Zn2+ ions replace protons in the zeolite framework, creating Zn-O-• pairs that act as active sites for alkane activation. This structure is crucial for the catalyst's functionality.

          Reaction mechanism: The transformation of alkanes (e.g., ethane, propane) begins with dehydrogenation to corresponding alkenes, followed by dehydrocyclooligomerisation. The specific mechanism for ethane activation involves:
          1. Rupture of the ethane C-H bond on the Zn-O pair, with zinc acting as an acceptor for the alkyl group.
          2. Formation of ethene from the alkyl group bound to Zn.
          3. Formation of dihydrogen from the Brønsted proton and hydrogen bound to Zn.

          Efficiency: The alkyl activation route has lower activation barriers compared to alternative routes, making it more efficient. The incorporation of zinc greatly increases the selectivity towards aromatization of small alkanes.

          Industrial significance: Zn-doped catalysts are used in commercial processes like the Cyclar process, highlighting their importance in industry. Their ability to efficiently convert alkanes to more valuable products, particularly aromatics, makes them crucial for petrochemical and fuel production applications.

          These factors collectively contribute to the catalytic performance of Zn-exchanged zeolites in alkane transformations, making them industrially significant for processes such as the conversion of light hydrocarbons to aromatics.

          金属基催化剂的组成、结构和反应条件，特别是锌交换沸石，显著影响烷烃转化的机理和效率，尤其是在脱氢和芳构化等过程中。

          组成：锌可以通过多种方法引入沸石中，包括水相或固相离子交换技术以及ZnCl2蒸气在H-ZSM5上的沉积。催化活性物种主要是离子态的Zn2+阳离子。

          结构：Zn2+离子取代沸石骨架中的质子，创造了作为烷烃活化活性位点的Zn-O-•对。这种结构对催化剂的功能至关重要。

          反应机理：烷烃（如乙烷、丙烷）的转化始于脱氢生成相应的烯烃，随后进行脱氢环化寡聚。乙烷活化的具体机理包括：
          1. 在Zn-O对上断裂乙烷的C-H键，锌作为烷基基团的受体。
          2. 从与Zn结合的烷基基团形成乙烯。
          3. 从Brønsted质子和与Zn结合的氢形成氢气。

          效率：与其他路径相比，烷基活化路径具有较低的活化能垒，因此效率更高。锌的引入大大提高了对小分子烷烃芳构化的选择性。

          工业重要性：锌掺杂催化剂用于商业过程，如Cyclar工艺，突显了它们在工业中的重要性。它们能够高效地将烷烃转化为更有价值的产品，特别是芳烃，使它们在石油化工和燃料生产应用中至关重要。

          这些因素共同影响锌交换沸石在烷烃转化中的催化性能，使它们在轻质烃转化为芳烃等工业过程中具有重要意义。
