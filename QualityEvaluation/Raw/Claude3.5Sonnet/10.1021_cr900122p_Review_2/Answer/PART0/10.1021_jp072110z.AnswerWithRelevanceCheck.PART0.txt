          [1] "High silica zeolites modified with gallium are known to be effective catalysts for promoting the dehydrogenation of light alkanes and subsequent aromatization of the thus produced alkenes."

[2] "The oxidized form of Ga/ZSM-5, where the main fraction of gallium ions is assumed to be present in the form of isolated gallyl ions, was found to be initially the most active for light alkane dehydrogenation."

[3] "We estimate formation of not more than three ethylene molecules per isolated GaO+ species before being reduced to Ga+. This, however, contradicts the recently reported observation of about 1000 catalytic cycles per oxidized gallium site in Ga/ZSM-5."

[4] "On the other hand, a low stability and, therefore, very high reactivity of the isolated gallyl ions may cause processes such as oligomerization of the isolated GaO+ species in the selectively oxidized Ga/ZSM-5 zeolite. In this case, a wide variety of different gallium oxide clusters can be generated."

[5] "The overall activation energy for ethane dehydrogenation over GaO+ sites in this case will not exceed 150 kJ mol-1. This value is about 25% lower than the one calculated for ethane dehydrogenation over the reduced Ga+ sites in ZSM-5 zeolite."

[6] "Although the initial alkyl activation of ethane is slightly more favorable as compared to the carbenium mechanism, subsequent chemical transformations of the reaction intermediates are easier in the latter case because of their lower stability."

[7] "The activation energies for the concerted C2H6 dehydrogenation paths are very close to those for the corresponding competitive elementary steps of the primary dehydrogenation route"

          The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts, particularly supported vanadium oxides and metal-exchanged zeolites like Ga/ZSM-5, significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations in processes such as oxidative dehydrogenation:

1. Composition: Gallium-modified high silica zeolites are effective catalysts for light alkane dehydrogenation and subsequent aromatization. The oxidation state of gallium (e.g., GaO+ vs Ga+) affects catalytic activity, with oxidized forms showing higher initial activity.

2. Structure: Isolated gallyl ions (GaO+) in Ga/ZSM-5 zeolites show high initial activity for light alkane dehydrogenation. The geometry of cation sites in the zeolite framework influences the stability and reactivity of gallium species.

3. Reaction mechanisms: Both alkyl and carbenium mechanisms are possible for ethane activation. The carbenium mechanism shows easier subsequent transformations due to lower intermediate stability. Concerted dehydrogenation pathways compete with primary dehydrogenation routes.

4. Efficiency: The overall activation energy for ethane dehydrogenation over GaO+ sites is about 25% lower than that for reduced Ga+ sites, indicating higher efficiency of the oxidized form. However, the stability of GaO+ species is limited, with estimates suggesting only about three catalytic cycles before reduction to Ga+.

5. Catalyst stability: The oxidized GaO+ species quickly reduce to Ga+ under reaction conditions, limiting long-term stability. Low stability of isolated gallyl ions may lead to oligomerization, forming various gallium oxide clusters.

These factors contribute to the industrial significance of metal-based catalysts by influencing their activity, selectivity, and longevity. The high initial activity of oxidized catalysts makes them attractive for industrial applications. However, the rapid deactivation and complex behavior of gallium species present challenges for maintaining long-term catalytic performance, requiring careful control of reaction conditions or periodic regeneration.

          金属基催化剂的组成、结构和反应条件，特别是负载的钒氧化物和金属交换的沸石（如Ga/ZSM-5），显著影响烷烃转化的机理和效率，尤其是在氧化脱氢等过程中：

1. 组成：镓改性的高硅沸石是轻烷烃脱氢和随后芳构化的有效催化剂。镓的氧化态（如GaO+与Ga+）影响催化活性，氧化态表现出更高的初始活性。

2. 结构：Ga/ZSM-5沸石中的孤立镓基离子（GaO+）对轻烷烃脱氢表现出高初始活性。沸石骨架中阳离子位点的几何构型影响镓物种的稳定性和反应活性。

3. 反应机理：乙烷活化可能遵循烷基和碳正离子机理。碳正离子机理由于中间体稳定性较低而表现出更容易的后续转化。协同脱氢途径与主要脱氢路线竞争。

4. 效率：GaO+位点上乙烷脱氢的总体活化能比还原态Ga+位点低约25%，表明氧化态形式效率更高。然而，GaO+物种的稳定性有限，估计在还原为Ga+之前只能进行约三次催化循环。

5. 催化剂稳定性：氧化的GaO+物种在反应条件下快速还原为Ga+，限制了长期稳定性。孤立镓基离子的低稳定性可能导致寡聚，形成各种镓氧化物簇。

这些因素通过影响催化剂的活性、选择性和寿命，对金属基催化剂的工业重要性做出贡献。氧化催化剂的高初始活性使其在工业应用中具有吸引力。然而，快速失活和镓物种的复杂行为给维持长期催化性能带来了挑战，需要仔细控制反应条件或定期再生。
