          [1] "The dehydroaromatization of methane to benzene has been investigated over a 2 wt% Mo/ZSM-5 catalyst in the absence of an added oxidant."

[2] "Under typical CH4 reaction conditions at 700C, 60–80% of the original Mo6+ ions are reduced to form Mo2C, with the remaining Mo occurring primarily as Mo4+ and traces of Mo5+ ions."

[3] "Exposure of a 2 wt% Mo/ZSM-5 catalyst to CH4 or to CH4/H2 at 700C causes reduction of Mo ions to Mo2C, rather than to metallic Mo."

[4] "Since preformation of Mo2C on the catalyst, without coke deposition, does not completely eliminate the induction period, it is believed that the clean surface of Mo2C may be too reactive to form higher hydrocarbons and, thus, that a coke-modified Mo2C surface may be the actual active species in the formation of ethylene as the reaction intermediate."

[5] "The presence of a certain concentration of acid sites in Mo/ZSM-5 catalysts is thus necessary to achieve a high benzene selectivity and a high methane conversion, since the formation of aromatics is thermodynamically favored"

[6] "During preparation and/or pretreatment of the catalyst, a portion of the Mo ions diffuses into the channels of the zeolite. The amount of Mo ions within the channels depends on the temperature, time, and atmosphere of calcination."

[7] "It appears that the dispersion of molybdenum oxide species on the surface of ZSM-5 may occur slowly and/or may be restricted to a short distance."

          The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts, particularly Mo/ZSM-5, significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations, especially in the dehydroaromatization of methane to benzene. Key factors include:

1. Catalyst composition: 2 wt% Mo loading on ZSM-5 zeolite support is effective for methane conversion to benzene.

2. Catalyst structure: Mo species are initially present on the external surface of ZSM-5 and partially diffuse into the zeolite channels during preparation and pretreatment. The distribution of Mo affects catalyst performance.

3. Reaction conditions: High temperature (700°C) and the absence of added oxidants are critical. These conditions promote the reduction of Mo6+ to Mo2C, which is the active species for methane activation.

4. Active site formation: 60-80% of original Mo6+ ions are reduced to Mo2C under reaction conditions, with the remaining Mo present as Mo4+ and Mo5+. The formation of Mo2C corresponds to the initial activation period for benzene production.

5. Surface modification: A coke-modified Mo2C surface is believed to be the actual active species for forming ethylene as a reaction intermediate, as the clean Mo2C surface may be too reactive.

6. Acid sites: The presence of acid sites in the zeolite is necessary for high benzene selectivity and methane conversion, as they promote the formation of aromatics.

7. Preparation conditions: Calcination temperature, time, and atmosphere affect Mo distribution and catalyst performance.

These factors contribute to the industrial significance of Mo/ZSM-5 catalysts by enabling the direct conversion of methane to valuable aromatic compounds under non-oxidative conditions. The ability to control Mo distribution and oxidation state through preparation and pretreatment conditions allows for optimization of catalyst performance for potential industrial applications in natural gas utilization.

          金属基催化剂的组成、结构和反应条件，特别是Mo/ZSM-5，显著影响烷烃转化的机理和效率，尤其是在甲烷脱氢芳构化为苯的过程中。关键因素包括：

1. 催化剂组成：2 wt% Mo负载在ZSM-5分子筛载体上对甲烷转化为苯很有效。

2. 催化剂结构：Mo物种最初存在于ZSM-5的外表面，在制备和预处理过程中部分扩散到沸石孔道中。Mo的分布影响催化剂性能。

3. 反应条件：高温（700°C）和无添加氧化剂是关键。这些条件促进Mo6+还原为Mo2C，后者是甲烷活化的活性物种。

4. 活性位点形成：在反应条件下，60-80%的原始Mo6+离子被还原为Mo2C，剩余的Mo以Mo4+和Mo5+的形式存在。Mo2C的形成对应于苯生产的初始活化期。

5. 表面修饰：积炭改性的Mo2C表面被认为是形成乙烯作为反应中间体的实际活性物种，因为干净的Mo2C表面可能反应性太强。

6. 酸性位点：沸石中酸性位点的存在对于获得高苯选择性和甲烷转化率是必要的，因为它们促进芳烃的形成。

7. 制备条件：煅烧温度、时间和气氛影响Mo的分布和催化剂性能。

这些因素通过在非氧化条件下实现甲烷直接转化为有价值的芳烃化合物，为Mo/ZSM-5催化剂的工业重要性做出贡献。通过制备和预处理条件控制Mo分布和氧化态的能力，可以优化催化剂性能以满足天然气利用的潜在工业应用需求。
