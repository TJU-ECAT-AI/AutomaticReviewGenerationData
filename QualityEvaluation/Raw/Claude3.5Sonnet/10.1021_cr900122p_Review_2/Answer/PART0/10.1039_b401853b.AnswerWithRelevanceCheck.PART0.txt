          [1] "ZnMFI catalyzes dehydrogenation and aromatization of light paraffins, etc."

[2] "Unlike ion exchange or incipient wetness impregnation, the reaction of hydrogen forms of MFI with zinc vapour at 773 K results in the practically complete substitution of protons by zinc ions."

[3] "The catalytic properties of high-silica zeolites modified with bivalent cations are quite different from those of faujasites containing the same cations."

[4] "Zinc or other bivalent ions with only partially compensated positive charges exhibit an unusually high chemical activity. This explains the specific catalytic and adsorption properties of high-silica zeolites modified with the bivalent transition metal cations."

[5] "Our recent results also demonstrated that MFI modified with bivalent Zn or Co cations possess unusual adsorption properties. For instance, low-frequency shifts of HH stretching vibrations of molecular hydrogen adsorbed by these ions at 77 K exceed 200 cm1."

[6] "Application of low temperature H2 adsorption as a molecular probe indicated that similar sites of unusual localization of bivalent zinc cations also exist in zeolites modified by ion exchange or incipient wetness impregnation, but the amount of such sites is less than for the samples modified by reaction with zinc vapour."

[7] "Complete substitution of protons indicates that at high Si/Al ratios some of the Zn2 cations are localized at the isolated aluminium occupied oxygen tetrahedra with single negative charges. This results in the formation of sites with only partially compensated excessive positive charges of bivalent cations."

          The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts, particularly metal-exchanged zeolites like ZnMFI, significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations:

1. Composition: The type of metal ion (e.g., Zn, Co) and the Si/Al ratio of the zeolite framework affect the catalytic properties. High-silica zeolites modified with bivalent transition metal cations exhibit unique catalytic and adsorption properties.

2. Structure: In high-silica zeolites, bivalent cations like Zn2+ can be localized at isolated aluminum sites, creating sites with partially compensated positive charges. This unusual localization contributes to high chemical activity.

3. Reaction conditions: The method of metal incorporation affects catalyst properties. Reaction with zinc vapor at high temperatures (773 K) results in complete substitution of protons by zinc ions, unlike ion exchange or incipient wetness impregnation.

4. Mechanisms: The partially compensated positive charges of metal ions lead to strong interactions with adsorbates, facilitating processes such as dehydrogenation and aromatization of light paraffins.

5. Efficiency: The unusual adsorption properties and high chemical activity of these catalysts contribute to their efficiency in alkane transformations. For example, low-frequency shifts of H-H stretching vibrations of adsorbed hydrogen exceed 200 cm-1 at 77 K, indicating strong perturbation of adsorbed molecules.

6. Industrial significance: ZnMFI catalyzes industrially important processes like dehydrogenation and aromatization of light paraffins. The ability to control catalyst properties through composition and preparation methods enables the development of highly efficient and selective catalysts for various alkane transformation processes.

          金属基催化剂的组成、结构和反应条件，特别是像ZnMFI这样的金属交换沸石，显著影响烷烃转化的机理和效率：

1. 组成：金属离子的类型（如Zn、Co）和沸石骨架的硅铝比影响催化性能。用二价过渡金属阳离子改性的高硅沸石表现出独特的催化和吸附性质。

2. 结构：在高硅沸石中，二价阳离子如Zn2+可以定位在孤立的铝位点上，形成部分补偿正电荷的位点。这种不寻常的定位贡献了高化学活性。

3. 反应条件：金属引入的方法影响催化剂性能。在高温（773 K）下与锌蒸气反应导致质子被锌离子完全取代，这与离子交换或浸渍法不同。

4. 机理：金属离子的部分补偿正电荷导致与吸附质的强相互作用，促进了轻质烷烃的脱氢和芳构化等过程。

5. 效率：这些催化剂的不寻常吸附性质和高化学活性有助于提高烷烃转化的效率。例如，在77 K下吸附氢气的H-H伸缩振动的低频移动超过200 cm-1，表明吸附分子受到强烈扰动。

6. 工业意义：ZnMFI催化工业上重要的过程，如轻质烷烃的脱氢和芳构化。通过组成和制备方法控制催化剂性能的能力，使得可以开发出高效和选择性的催化剂用于各种烷烃转化过程。
