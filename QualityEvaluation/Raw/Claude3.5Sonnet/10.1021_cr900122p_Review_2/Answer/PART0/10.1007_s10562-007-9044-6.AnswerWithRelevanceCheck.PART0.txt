          [1] "Incorporation of zinc cations into high-silica zeolites enhances the selectivity of zeolite catalysts towards light alkane dehydrogenation and aromatization [13]."

[2] "It seems that the incorporated Zn2+ cations act as strong Lewis sites and change the mechanism of the alkane activation and transformation favoring a hydrogen removal step [2, 410]."

[3] "Analysis of the results on characterization of zinc species suggested that Zn/H-MFI involves three types of Zn species: small and large ZnO clusters and zinc cations."

[4] "For Zn/H-MFI sample used in this study with high Zn content, (OZ)(ZnOZn)2+(OZ) or (ZO)Zn+OSi cations should preferably form based on the literature data [2, 22]. However, the presence of Zn2+ or ZnOH+ cannot be excluded."

[5] "The mechanism of H/D exchange for propane involving Zn2+ cations is shown on Scheme 3. Zn2+ cations located at neighbouring [4] or distanly separated [10] basic oxygens of the Si O Al groups in the zeolite framework provide a heterolytic dissociative adsorption of propane and offer Zn-propyl species and acid protons of the SiOHAl group."

[6] "Regioselectivity of the exchange for Zn/H-MFI implies that the mechanism of the exchange changes, when the zeolite is modified with Zn."

[7] "For the case with Zn- containing H-MFI, the dehydrogenation of propane molecule to form carbenium ion can occur either on zinc cations or Lewis sites of subnanomeric custers of ZnO due to prevalence of these two Zn species in the zeolite [1, 23, 2629]."

          The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts, particularly zinc-modified zeolites like Zn/H-MFI, significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations. 

Incorporating zinc cations into high-silica zeolites enhances selectivity towards light alkane dehydrogenation and aromatization. In Zn/H-MFI catalysts, three types of zinc species are present: small and large ZnO clusters, and zinc cations. The specific form of zinc species depends on the zinc content, with high zinc content favoring the formation of (OZ)(ZnOZn)2+(OZ) or (ZO)Zn+OSi cations, although Zn2+ or ZnOH+ may also be present.

These zinc species, especially Zn2+ cations, act as strong Lewis sites and change the mechanism of alkane activation and transformation, favoring hydrogen removal. The structure of the catalyst plays a crucial role in the reaction mechanism. Zn2+ cations located at neighboring or distantly separated basic oxygens of the Si-O-Al groups in the zeolite framework provide heterolytic dissociative adsorption of propane, offering Zn-propyl species and acid protons of the Si-OH-Al group.

The modification of zeolites with zinc changes the reaction mechanism, as evidenced by the regioselectivity of hydrogen/deuterium exchange observed in Zn/H-MFI compared to unmodified H-MFI. The dehydrogenation of propane to form carbenium ions can occur on either zinc cations or Lewis sites of subnanometric ZnO clusters.

These factors contribute to the industrial significance of metal-exchanged zeolites by allowing for more selective and efficient alkane transformations, which are crucial in various industrial processes such as the production of valuable petrochemicals and fuels. The ability to tune the catalyst's composition and structure allows for enhanced selectivity and efficiency in important reactions such as dehydrogenation and aromatization, making these catalysts valuable for industrial applications.

          金属基催化剂的组成、结构和反应条件，特别是像Zn/H-MFI这样的锌改性沸石，显著影响烷烃转化的机理和效率。

将锌阳离子掺入高硅沸石中可以提高对轻烷烃脱氢和芳构化的选择性。在Zn/H-MFI催化剂中，存在三种类型的锌物种：小型和大型ZnO簇，以及锌阳离子。锌物种的具体形式取决于锌含量，高锌含量有利于形成(OZ)(ZnOZn)2+(OZ)或(ZO)Zn+OSi阳离子，但Zn2+或ZnOH+物种也可能存在。

这些锌物种，特别是Zn2+阳离子，作为强Lewis酸位点，改变了烷烃活化和转化的机理，有利于氢的脱除。催化剂的结构在反应机理中起着关键作用。位于沸石骨架中Si-O-Al基团相邻或远离的基本氧原子处的Zn2+阳离子提供了丙烷的异裂解离吸附，形成Zn-丙基物种和Si-OH-Al基团的酸质子。

用锌改性沸石会改变反应机理，这从Zn/H-MFI中观察到的氢/氘交换的区域选择性与未改性的H-MFI相比可以得到证实。丙烷脱氢形成碳正离子可以在锌阳离子或亚纳米ZnO簇的路易斯酸位点上进行。

这些因素通过允许更具选择性和效率的烷烃转化，为金属交换沸石的工业重要性做出了贡献，这在各种工业过程中至关重要，如有价值的石油化学品和燃料的生产。能够调节催化剂的组成和结构，可以在重要反应（如脱氢和芳构化）中提高选择性和效率，使这些催化剂在工业应用中具有重要价值。
