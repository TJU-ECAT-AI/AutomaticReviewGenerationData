          [1] "The oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of propane over a supported vanadia catalyst is of great interest because of its importance in industrial catalysis."

[2] "Experimental studies of catalyst structure (25) generally agree that when the concentration of vanadium oxide species is low, isolated VO4 units form on the support surface. These units are assumed to contain a vertical VO double bond and three bridging VOS linkages, where S represents the support metal cation (S = Al, Si, Ti, etc.)."

[3] "The dependence of the reactivity on coverage of the support surface by vanadium oxide is unclear in the literature."

[4] "Experimental studies of the ODH reaction with supported vanadia catalysts have generally supported the reaction mechanism originally proposed by Mars and van Krevelen."

[5] "The experimental barriers for propane ODH on supported vanadium oxide are in the range 2030 kcal/mol, (4,10,22) which are much lower than the value of about 80 kcal/mol found in this study for the water elimination step."

[6] "Our results point toward a possible reason as to why the interaction of vanadium oxide with a support may lower the barrier for the initial dissociative adsorption of propane and propene elimination steps in the ODH reaction pathways investigated here"

[7] "We have carried out a hybrid density functional study of mechanisms for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane on the (010) surface of V2O5. The surface was modeled using both vanadium oxide clusters and a periodic slab."

[8] "The potential energy surface is found to have large barriers, which are lowered somewhat when the possibility of a triplet state is considered."

[9] "The barriers on the reaction pathway are 4580 kcal/mol above the energy of the reactants, which are much larger than found experimentally for propane ODH on supported vanadia."

          The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts, particularly supported vanadium oxides, significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations, especially in oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) processes.

1. Composition and Structure:
   - At low concentrations, vanadium oxide forms isolated VO4 units on the support surface, containing a vertical VO double bond and three bridging VOS linkages.
   - The concentration of vanadium oxide species affects the catalyst structure, but the relationship between reactivity and surface coverage is not fully understood.
   - The interaction between vanadium oxide and the support material plays a crucial role in determining catalytic activity.

2. Reaction Mechanism:
   - Supported vanadia catalysts generally follow the Mars-van Krevelen mechanism for ODH reactions.
   - The potential energy surface of the reaction has large barriers, which can be somewhat lowered when considering the possibility of a triplet state.

3. Efficiency and Barriers:
   - Experimental barriers for propane ODH on supported vanadium oxide are much lower (20-30 kcal/mol) compared to theoretical calculations on clean V2O5 surfaces (about 80 kcal/mol).
   - The interaction of vanadium oxide with a support may lower barriers for initial dissociative adsorption of propane and propene elimination steps.
   - Theoretical calculations show barriers of 45-80 kcal/mol for the reaction pathway, which are still higher than experimental values for supported vanadia.

4. Industrial Significance:
   - The lower activation barriers and enhanced catalytic activity of supported vanadium oxide catalysts contribute to their industrial importance in alkane transformation processes.
   - The ability to tune catalyst performance through composition and structure offers opportunities for optimizing industrial processes.

5. Modeling and Research:
   - Hybrid density functional studies have been conducted to model the ODH of propane on V2O5 surfaces using both vanadium oxide clusters and periodic slabs.
   - The discrepancy between theoretical and experimental results highlights the need for further research to fully understand the mechanisms behind the enhanced catalytic activity of supported vanadium oxide catalysts.

While the provided information does not specifically address metal-exchanged zeolites, the principles of how support materials influence catalyst performance may be applicable to zeolite-based systems as well.

          金属基催化剂的组成、结构和反应条件，特别是负载型钒氧化物，显著影响烷烃转化的机理和效率，尤其是在氧化脱氢（ODH）过程中。

1. 组成和结构：
   - 在低浓度下，钒氧化物在载体表面形成孤立的VO4单元，包含一个垂直的VO双键和三个桥接的VOS键。
   - 钒氧化物物种的浓度影响催化剂结构，但反应性与表面覆盖率之间的关系尚未完全理解。
   - 钒氧化物与载体材料之间的相互作用在决定催化活性方面起着关键作用。

2. 反应机理：
   - 负载型钒催化剂通常遵循Mars-van Krevelen机理进行ODH反应。
   - 反应的势能面存在较大的能垒，考虑三重态的可能性时这些能垒略有降低。

3. 效率和能垒：
   - 负载型钒氧化物上丙烷ODH的实验能垒要低得多（20-30 kcal/mol），相比于在纯V2O5表面上的理论计算值（约80 kcal/mol）。
   - 钒氧化物与载体的相互作用可能会降低丙烷初始解离吸附和丙烯消除步骤的能垒。
   - 理论计算显示反应路径的能垒为45-80 kcal/mol，仍高于负载型钒催化剂的实验值。

4. 工业意义：
   - 较低的活化能垒和增强的催化活性使负载型钒氧化物催化剂在烷烃转化过程中具有重要的工业意义。
   - 通过组成和结构调整催化剂性能的能力为优化工业过程提供了机会。

5. 建模和研究：
   - 已经进行了混合密度泛函研究，使用钒氧化物簇和周期性平板模型来模拟V2O5表面上的丙烷ODH。
   - 理论与实验结果之间的差异突显了进一步研究的必要性，以充分理解负载型钒氧化物催化剂增强催化活性的机理。

虽然提供的信息没有具体提到金属交换沸石，但支撑材料如何影响催化剂性能的原理可能也适用于基于沸石的体系。
