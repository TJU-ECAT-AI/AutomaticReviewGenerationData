          [1] "All catalysts used industrially for the production of maleic anhydride from butane are PVO-based systems."

[2] "The vanadyl pyrophosphate catalyst, due to its particular crystalline structure, shows a singular ability to control its oxidizing power."

[3] "The best selectivity is achieved when desorption of less selective intermediates along the reaction coordinate is avoided because the olefin reactions are less selective on a highly active butane (VO)2P2O7 catalyst."

[4] "The availability of oxygen to the surface is critical in avoiding desorption of less selective olefins. Thus it would appear that major selectivity gains could be achieved if more oxygen could be channeled to the active site."

[5] "A central role in the modification of surface reactivity is adsorption of organic molecules and oxygen species. The mobility of these species under steady-state conditions of reaction is another characteristic of the vanadyl pyrophosphate catalyst in n-butane oxidation"

[6] "The vanadium phosphorus oxide system is characterized by facile formation and interconversion of a number of crystalline V(IV) and V(V) phases, and this has led to some confusion in the literature as to the nature of the active phase."

[7] "Kinetics data agree that the hydrocarbon activation is the first step in n-butane oxidation."

[8] "The TAP results suggest that the selectivity of the butane oxidation reaction is influenced by the concentration of these species at the initial butane adsorption site."

[9] "Activation of the alkane hydrocarbon is a further important aspect of this reaction because of its mechanistic relevance in the study of other heterogeneous reactions for functionalization of alkanes"

[10] "A very specific surface structure is needed, and it would seem that the binding of intermediates until product is formed (single-site process) is essential to high selectivities."

[11] "For example, the use of an organic solvent during preparation as opposed to an aqueous system results in differing degrees of crystallinity and defect structure of the resulting active phase."

          The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts, particularly vanadium phosphorus oxide (VPO) catalysts, significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations in processes like oxidative dehydrogenation and n-butane oxidation to maleic anhydride. Key factors include:

1. Catalyst composition: VPO catalysts contain both V(IV) and V(V) phases, with the optimal ratio depending on reaction conditions.

2. Crystal structure: The vanadyl pyrophosphate ((VO)2P2O7) phase is considered the active phase. Its unique crystalline structure allows precise control of oxidizing power, which is crucial for selectivity.

3. Surface properties: The concentration and type of oxygen species on the surface, as well as the adsorption of organic molecules, play a crucial role in determining catalyst activity and selectivity.

4. Reaction conditions: Oxygen availability at the surface is critical. Improving oxygen channeling to active sites could potentially increase selectivity.

5. Preparation method: The use of organic solvents versus aqueous systems during synthesis affects the crystallinity and defect structure of the active phase.

6. Redox properties: The ability of the catalyst to undergo controlled reduction and reoxidation is key to its selectivity.

7. Intermediate binding: A specific surface structure that binds intermediates until product formation (single-site process) is essential for high selectivities.

These factors contribute to the industrial significance of VPO catalysts for n-butane oxidation. Their unique ability to selectively activate and transform alkanes without releasing intermediates allows for high selectivity to maleic anhydride, which has not been matched by other catalytic systems.

While the focus is on VPO catalysts for butane oxidation, the principles discussed regarding controlled redox properties, oxygen mobility, and surface reactivity are relevant to other metal-based catalysts for alkane transformations. However, specific mechanisms and efficiency factors may differ for other systems such as supported vanadium oxides or metal-exchanged zeolites used in oxidative dehydrogenation or other zeolite-catalyzed reactions.

          金属基催化剂的组成、结构和反应条件，特别是钒磷氧化物（VPO）催化剂，显著影响烷烃转化过程中的机理和效率，如氧化脱氢过程和正丁烷氧化制顺丁烯二酸酐。关键因素包括：

1. 催化剂组成：VPO催化剂含有V(IV)和V(V)相，最佳比例取决于反应条件。

2. 晶体结构：焦磷酸钒酰((VO)2P2O7)被认为是活性相。其独特的晶体结构允许精确控制氧化能力，这对选择性至关重要。

3. 表面性质：表面氧物种的浓度和类型，以及有机分子的吸附，在决定催化剂活性和选择性方面起着关键作用。

4. 反应条件：表面氧的可用性至关重要。改善氧气向活性位点的输送可能会增加选择性。

5. 制备方法：在合成过程中使用有机溶剂与水系统会影响活性相的结晶度和缺陷结构。

6. 氧化还原性质：催化剂进行可控还原和再氧化的能力是其选择性的关键。

7. 中间体结合：能够结合中间体直至产物形成（单点过程）的特定表面结构对于获得高选择性至关重要。

这些因素造就了VPO催化剂在正丁烷氧化中的工业重要性。它们独特的能力可以选择性地活化和转化烷烃而不释放中间体，从而对顺丁烯二酸酐有高选择性，这是其他催化系统所无法匹敌的。

虽然重点关注用于丁烷氧化的VPO催化剂，但关于控制氧化还原性质、氧移动性和表面反应性的讨论原则也适用于其他用于烷烃转化的金属基催化剂。然而，对于其他系统，如用于氧化脱氢或其他沸石催化反应的负载型钒氧化物或金属交换沸石，具体机理和影响效率的因素可能会有所不同。
