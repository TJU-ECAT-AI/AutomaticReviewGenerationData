          [1] "Supported vanadium oxides are one of the best catalysts for the ODH of propane with high thermal stability and the large surface area."

          [2] "Generally, the activity and selectivity of the catalyst depends on its reducibility and basicity."

          [3] "To achieve high activity and selectivity the presence of highly dispersed vanadium is crucial."

          [4] "For a good catalyst, there is a compromise between the activity in CH bond activation and the easiness to release the propene molecule from the surface."

          [5] "From our study, for example, the reducibility of the O(2) site is indeed much facilitated by other surface atoms, which is a rather long-range effect."

          [6] "In supported catalysts, multiple lattice O species are available, including VO, VOV, and VOM sites (M is the metal cation from oxide supports). This introduces much flexibility in controlling the catalyst activity as the electronic structures of the two-coordinated O and the terminal VO in these systems can be very different from the V2O5 bulk."

          [7] "It is found that at low loadings vanadium is molecularly dispersed, whereas at higher loadings V2O5 crystallites start to appear."

          [8] "Overall, the vanadyl oxygen O(1) on the V2O5(001) surface is slightly more reactive in CH bond activation than is the O(2) atom. However, the propoxide on the O(2) is much easier to further decompose into propene."

          [9] "For the ODH reaction, the high activities in activating CH bond and in producing propene are two properties acting negatively to each other. It is expected that the activity of the oxide-supported vanadium can be tuned by controlling the polymerization extent and the support materials."

          The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts, particularly supported vanadium oxides, significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations in oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) processes.

          Composition: Supported vanadium oxides are highly effective catalysts for propane ODH due to their high thermal stability and large surface area. The presence of highly dispersed vanadium is crucial for achieving high activity and selectivity. At low loadings, vanadium is molecularly dispersed, while at higher loadings, V2O5 crystallites form.

          Structure: The catalyst's reducibility and basicity are key factors determining its activity and selectivity. In supported catalysts, multiple lattice oxygen species (VO, VOV, and VOM) are available, providing flexibility in controlling catalyst activity. The electronic structures of these oxygen species can differ significantly from those in bulk V2O5. The vanadyl oxygen O(1) is slightly more reactive in C-H bond activation, while the bridging oxygen O(2) facilitates easier propene formation.

          Reaction conditions: The efficiency of the catalyst depends on a balance between its ability to activate C-H bonds and its ability to release propene. The reducibility of oxygen sites, such as O(2), is facilitated by other surface atoms, demonstrating a long-range effect.

          Factors contributing to industrial significance:
          1. High thermal stability and large surface area
          2. Tunability of catalyst activity through vanadium dispersion and support modification
          3. Flexibility in controlling catalyst activity due to multiple lattice oxygen species
          4. Ability to balance C-H bond activation and product release
          5. Potential for optimizing performance by controlling vanadium polymerization and choice of support materials

          While the provided information doesn't specifically discuss metal-exchanged zeolites or zeolite-catalyzed reactions, the principles of balancing activity and selectivity likely apply to those systems as well.

          金属基催化剂的组成、结构和反应条件，特别是负载型钒氧化物，显著影响烷烃转化过程中的机理和效率，尤其是在氧化脱氢（ODH）过程中。

          组成：负载型钒氧化物是丙烷ODH的高效催化剂，这归因于它们的高热稳定性和大比表面积。高度分散的钒的存在对于实现高活性和选择性至关重要。在低负载量时，钒呈分子分散状态，而在高负载量时，会形成V2O5晶体。

          结构：催化剂的还原性和碱性是决定其活性和选择性的关键因素。在负载型催化剂中，存在多种晶格氧物种（VO、VOV和VOM），这为控制催化剂活性提供了灵活性。这些氧物种的电子结构可能与体相V2O5中的显著不同。钒酰氧（O(1)）在C-H键活化方面略微更具反应性，而桥接氧（O(2)）更容易形成丙烯。

          反应条件：催化剂的效率取决于其活化C-H键的能力和释放丙烯的能力之间的平衡。氧位点（如O(2)）的还原性受其他表面原子的影响，显示出长程效应。

          对工业重要性的贡献因素：
          1. 高热稳定性和大比表面积
          2. 通过钒分散和载体改性实现催化剂活性的可调性
          3. 由于多种晶格氧物种而具有的控制催化剂活性的灵活性
          4. 平衡C-H键活化和产物释放的能力
          5. 通过控制钒的聚合程度和选择载体材料来优化性能的潜力

          虽然提供的信息没有具体讨论金属交换沸石或沸石催化反应，但平衡活性和选择性的原则可能也适用于这些系统。
