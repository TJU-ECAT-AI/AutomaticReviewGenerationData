          [1] "Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts are most active and selective for the aromatisation of propane [1]. It is widely accepted that their activity and selectivity result from their bifunctional properties, whereby gallium species are responsible for their dehydrogenation-hydrogenation activity and the Brönsted acid sites of the zeolite provide the centres necessary for chain growth."

[2] "Recently, it was shown that dual active sites are responsible for the activation of propane on Ga/H-ZSM-5 [2-4]. These dual active sites consist of highly dispersed (Ga3+, O2-) ions pairs, acting in synergy with neighbouring Brönsted sites which initially activate propane as a protonated pseudo-cyclopropane species."

[3] "Changes in the propane aromatisation activity and selectivity of these catalysts as a function of the number of reaction (reducing conditions)-regeneration (oxidative conditions) cycles sustained were explained by the migration of gallium species in and out of the zeolite intracrystalline void space [5] as substantiated by detailed catalyst characterisation [6]."

[4] "Hydrogen treatment increases activity and selectivity to aromatics while decreasing the formation of methane. Subsequent oxygen treatment enhances further the activity and aromatics selectivity and has little effect on methane selectivity."

[5] "These improvements of catalytic performance are explained by gallium migration in reducing conditions. The concentration of highly dispersed gallium species is thereby enhanced. These species, in association with Brønsted centers, were reported previously to constitute the dual catalytic sites responsible for alkane activation."

[6] "Several authors have also reported the inhibitory effect of hydrogen on propane transformation over Zn/H-ZSM-5 [24] and Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts [25]. A possible explanation is that the limiting step of the propane dehydrogenation is the removal of hydrogen [26]."

[7] "H2-O2 pretreatment thus appear to be a promising way to preactivate and stabilise Ga-modified aromatisation catalysts in commercial operation."

          The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts, particularly Ga/H-ZSM-5, significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations, especially in processes such as propane aromatization. Key factors include:

1. Composition: The bifunctional nature of Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts, with gallium species responsible for dehydrogenation-hydrogenation activity and Brönsted acid sites from the zeolite enabling chain growth, is crucial for their high activity and selectivity.

2. Structure: Dual active sites consisting of highly dispersed (Ga3+, O2-) ion pairs working synergistically with neighboring Brönsted sites are responsible for propane activation. The dispersion of gallium species within the zeolite structure is vital for catalyst performance.

3. Reaction conditions:
   a) Reducing conditions (H2 treatment) increase gallium dispersion, leading to higher activity and aromatics selectivity while reducing methane formation.
   b) Oxidative conditions (O2 treatment) following H2 treatment further boost activity and aromatics selectivity without affecting methane selectivity.
   c) Hydrogen can have an inhibitory effect on propane transformation, possibly due to its impact on the rate-limiting step of propane dehydrogenation.

4. Catalyst activation: H2-O2 pretreatment cycles dramatically improve catalytic performance by optimizing gallium dispersion and oxidation state. This pretreatment eliminates the induction period and could be industrially significant for preactivating and stabilizing catalysts before use in aromatization units.

5. Reaction-regeneration cycles: The migration of gallium species in and out of the zeolite intracrystalline void space during reaction (reducing) and regeneration (oxidative) cycles affects catalyst performance over time.

These factors contribute to the industrial significance of these catalysts by enhancing their activity, selectivity, and stability in alkane transformation processes, particularly in propane aromatization. The ability to fine-tune catalyst properties through composition, structure, and pretreatment conditions allows for optimized performance in industrial-scale applications.

          金属基催化剂的组成、结构和反应条件，特别是Ga/H-ZSM-5，显著影响烷烃转化的机理和效率，尤其是在丙烷芳构化等过程中。关键因素包括：

1. 组成：Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂的双功能性质至关重要，其中镓物种负责脱氢-加氢活性，而沸石的Brønsted酸位提供链增长所需的中心，这对于其高活性和选择性至关重要。

2. 结构：由高度分散的(Ga3+, O2-)离子对与邻近的Brønsted位点协同工作组成的双活性位点负责丙烷活化。镓物种在沸石结构中的分散度对催化剂性能至关重要。

3. 反应条件：
   a) 还原条件（H2处理）增加镓的分散度，提高活性和芳烃选择性，同时减少甲烷生成。
   b) 在H2处理后的氧化条件（O2处理）进一步提高活性和芳烃选择性，而不影响甲烷选择性。
   c) 氢气可能对丙烷转化有抑制作用，可能是由于其对丙烷脱氢速率限制步骤的影响。

4. 催化剂活化：H2-O2预处理循环通过优化镓的分散度和氧化态，显著改善催化性能。这种预处理消除了诱导期，在工业上可能对芳构化装置中催化剂的预活化和稳定化具有重要意义。

5. 反应-再生循环：在反应（还原）和再生（氧化）循环过程中，镓物种在沸石晶内孔隙空间的迁移影响催化剂的长期性能。

这些因素通过提高催化剂在烷烃转化过程（特别是丙烷芳构化）中的活性、选择性和稳定性，为这些催化剂的工业重要性做出了贡献。通过组成、结构和预处理条件来微调催化剂特性的能力，允许在工业规模应用中优化性能。
