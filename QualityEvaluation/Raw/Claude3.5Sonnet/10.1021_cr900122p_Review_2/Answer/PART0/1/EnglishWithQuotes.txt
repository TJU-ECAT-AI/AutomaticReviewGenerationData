Structure: The MFI zeolite framework provides a suitable environment for both zinc oxide species and acidic sites, allowing for the dissociative adsorption of propane and further oligomerization of propene.\n\n3. Reaction conditions: \n   - Pressure plays a crucial role in determining the reaction pathway. Low partial pressures favor hydrogen evolution, while high pressures promote the hydrogenolysis route.\n   - Temperature affects the reaction, with Zn/H-MFI catalysts requiring higher temperatures compared to other metal-exchanged zeolites due to the weaker strength of zinc oxide species.\n\nThe mechanism involves initial dissociative adsorption of propane on zinc oxide sites, followed by propene evolution and recombinative desorption of dihydrogen. Propene then oligomerizes over acidic sites, while dihydrogen either evolves as a final product or participates in propane hydrogenolysis into ethane and methane.\n\nThis mechanistic pathway contributes to the industrial significance of Zn/H-MFI catalysts by providing higher activity compared to H-MFI catalysts. However, it also results in lower selectivity to aromatics compared to Ga/H-MFI catalysts due to enhanced ethane and methane formation through hydrogenolysis.\n\nThe development of in situ MAS NMR spectroscopic techniques has allowed for direct monitoring of catalytic transformations on the catalyst surface during reactions, enabling detailed identification of the bifunctional mechanism in metal-modified zeolites.\n\nWhile the provided information doesn't specifically discuss oxidative dehydrogenation or supported vanadium oxides, the insights gained from the Zn/H-MFI system demonstrate how metal-based catalysts can be tailored to achieve desired alkane transformations.
