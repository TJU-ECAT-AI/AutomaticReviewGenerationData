"Zn-modified zeolites are effective catalysts for light alkanes aromatization [14]. The enhanced selectivity of alkane conversion (ethane [57] and propane [8,9]) towards aromatics is attributed to dehydrogenation ability of the loaded zinc species."

"It has been claimed [2,3] that strong Lewis sites, which are generated by zinc, change the mechanism of alkane activation and transformation from the beta scission to a dehydrogenation step."

"For Zn/H-BEA, the kinetic parameters of H/D exchange change dramatically. The rate constants kSiOHAl are at least two orders of magnitude higher. The activation energy of 86-88 kJ mol-1 is rather low. The exchange proceeds with a notable rate at temperatures at least 100 K lower compared to that on H-BEA."

"The promotion may consist of involvement of Zn-alkyl species in the exchange. They can be formed either on ZnO clusters or Zn2+ cations, located on neighbor or remote SiO()Al groups."

"Kazansky et al. [12–14] demonstrated the formation of strong adsorption complexes between small alkanes and Zn2+ cations by IR spectroscopy. They claimed that the activation of the alkane molecules in zeolite occurred on Zn2+ cations."

[1] "In general, in propane ODH catalysts made of Voxide supported on silica are more selective than those made with the alumina support, and the latter are more selective than those supported on titania, mainly because of the lower extent of parallel propane combustion, especially at low vanadia loading"

[2] "The reduction and catalytic properties of active VOx domains can be significantly affected by the formation of binary dispersed structures. For example, VOx-CrOx and VOx-MoOx mixed structures lead to a higher propane ODH rate and selectivity than VOx domains present at similar surface densities on pure Al2O3 supports"

[3] "The activation of the ethane CH bond proceeds through the formation of alkoxides, which decompose to ethylene and a surface OH group or are oxidized to surface-bound oxygenates (acetaldehyde)."

[4] "A key factor in the design of efficient catalysts for alkane ODH is the isolation of active sites. Therefore, the isomorphous substitution of active metal species, e.g., vanadium, into microporous and mesoporous materials is an attractive strategy for designing new catalysts for this reaction"

[5] "In the case of VCoAPO-18, the presence of both acid sites (related to the presence of Co2+ cations) and redox sites (related to the presence of V5+/4+ and Co3+/2+) seems to be an important factor in achieving high selectivities to ethylene during the ODH of ethane"

[6] "The catalytic activity of vanadium oxide catalysts increases with the V2O5 loading, while rates per V-atom reach a maximum on VOx domains of intermediate size, providing a balance between the activity of surface VOx species and their accessibility to reactants."

[7] "For both propane and ethane, reactivity data for catalysts made of supported vanadium oxide are consistent both with kinetically relevant steps involving the dissociation of CH bonds (methylenic C atom in propane) and with a Mars-van Krevelen redox mechanism involving lattice oxygen in CH bond activation."

[8] "One of the best performing catalysts in propane ODH is the VOx-SBA-15 system, prepared by an alcoholic impregnation method, in which the introduction of V species onto the inner walls of SBA-15 provides a system with a large concentration of accessible, isolated and structurally well-defined active sites."

[9] "The selectivity to propylene formation is affected by surface reduction: the higher the surface reduction, the higher the selectivity"

[10] "Additives (e.g., P, K, Ca, Ni, Cr, Nb, Mg, Au, Zn and Mo), sometimes added in relevant amount with respect to V, modify acidbasic and redox properties of supported vanadium oxide"

[11] "Examples include V-containing high-surface siliceous materials, such as MCM-41, MCM-48 or SBA-15. In these systems, the catalytic activity of vanadium is strongly influenced by its local environment and the co-existence of acid sites in the host material."

[1] "All catalysts used industrially for the production of maleic anhydride from butane are PVO-based systems."

[2] "The vanadyl pyrophosphate catalyst, due to its particular crystalline structure, shows a singular ability to control its oxidizing power."

[3] "The best selectivity is achieved when desorption of less selective intermediates along the reaction coordinate is avoided because the olefin reactions are less selective on a highly active butane (VO)2P2O7 catalyst."

[4] "The availability of oxygen to the surface is critical in avoiding desorption of less selective olefins. Thus it would appear that major selectivity gains could be achieved if more oxygen could be channeled to the active site."

[5] "A central role in the modification of surface reactivity is adsorption of organic molecules and oxygen species. The mobility of these species under steady-state conditions of reaction is another characteristic of the vanadyl pyrophosphate catalyst in n-butane oxidation"

[6] "The vanadium phosphorus oxide system is characterized by facile formation and interconversion of a number of crystalline V(IV) and V(V) phases, and this has led to some confusion in the literature as to the nature of the active phase."

[7] "Kinetics data agree that the hydrocarbon activation is the first step in n-butane oxidation."

[8] "The TAP results suggest that the selectivity of the butane oxidation reaction is influenced by the concentration of these species at the initial butane adsorption site."

[9] "Activation of the alkane hydrocarbon is a further important aspect of this reaction because of its mechanistic relevance in the study of other heterogeneous reactions for functionalization of alkanes"

[10] "A very specific surface structure is needed, and it would seem that the binding of intermediates until product is formed (single-site process) is essential to high selectivities."

[11] "For example, the use of an organic solvent during preparation as opposed to an aqueous system results in differing degrees of crystallinity and defect structure of the resulting active phase."

[1] "Zn- or Ga-modified zeolites effectively catalyze the conversion of light alkanes to aromatics with high selectivity."

[2] "The role of the metal species and acid sites of a zeolite in the enhancement of light alkane conversion to aromatics remains a subject of intense controversy, even after significant emphasis and numerous publications."

[3] "There is agreement on the bifunctional nature of these catalysts, where the metal species are responsible for the dehydrogenation of alkanes, while the Brnsted acid sites are involved in the oligomerization and cyclization of olefins."

[4] "When zeolites are modified with Zn, the picture of hydrogen exchange changes. Regioselectivity of the exchange is observed on Zn/H-ZSM-5 and Zn/H-BEA for propane and n-butane."

[5] "A significant increase in the reaction rates with lowering apparent activation energies demonstrate the promoting effect of Zn on the reaction of H/D hydrogen exchange for C1n-C4 alkanes."

[6] "The acceleration of H/D exchange, coupled with the decreased activation energy for Zn-modified zeolites, demonstrates that the CH bonds in alkanes break and form more easily and reversibly with intermediate involvement of Zn species."

[7] "The strong influence of Zn on the activation of CH bonds of small alkanes by the zeolite Brnsted sites is achieved by involvement in the exchange of Znalkyl species, whose formation from alkanes precedes its further involvement in interaction with Brnsted acid sites."

[1] "The dehydroaromatization of methane to benzene has been investigated over a 2 wt% Mo/ZSM-5 catalyst in the absence of an added oxidant."

[2] "Under typical CH4 reaction conditions at 700C, 60–80% of the original Mo6+ ions are reduced to form Mo2C, with the remaining Mo occurring primarily as Mo4+ and traces of Mo5+ ions."

[3] "Exposure of a 2 wt% Mo/ZSM-5 catalyst to CH4 or to CH4/H2 at 700C causes reduction of Mo ions to Mo2C, rather than to metallic Mo."

[4] "Since preformation of Mo2C on the catalyst, without coke deposition, does not completely eliminate the induction period, it is believed that the clean surface of Mo2C may be too reactive to form higher hydrocarbons and, thus, that a coke-modified Mo2C surface may be the actual active species in the formation of ethylene as the reaction intermediate."

[5] "The presence of a certain concentration of acid sites in Mo/ZSM-5 catalysts is thus necessary to achieve a high benzene selectivity and a high methane conversion, since the formation of aromatics is thermodynamically favored"

[6] "During preparation and/or pretreatment of the catalyst, a portion of the Mo ions diffuses into the channels of the zeolite. The amount of Mo ions within the channels depends on the temperature, time, and atmosphere of calcination."

[7] "It appears that the dispersion of molybdenum oxide species on the surface of ZSM-5 may occur slowly and/or may be restricted to a short distance."

[2] "Reactivity in the confined spaces of zeolites: the interplay between spectroscopy and theory to develop structureactivity relationships for catalysis"

[3] "Binuclear sites are argued to account for the enhanced activity of oxygenated gallium-exchanged high-silica zeolites in alkane dehydrogenation."

[4] "These sites, however, tend to decompose via water desorption upon the catalytic reaction resulting in less reactive reduced Ga+ ions."

[5] "As per predictions from the quantum-chemical calculations, the experimental results show that the high alkane dehydrogenation activity can be maintained by in situ hydrolysis of the reduced extraframework Ga species."

[6] "Clearly, co-feeding of water leads to a substantial increase of the propane conversion. The conversion passes a maximum at pH2O of 0.3 kPa."

[7] "The promoting effect of water is due to the formation of reactive partly hydrolyzed gallium species such as [HGaOGaOH]2+ and [HGa(OH)2GaH]2+ discussed above."

[8] "Addition of water to the hydrocarbon feed increases significantly the dehydrogenation activity. The main product remains propylene although with increasing water content, formation of the products of propane cracking (methane and ethylene) is observed."

[9] "Formation of less stable intermediate products in the catalytic cycle facilitates the regeneration of the active site. Indeed, moderate barriers are calculated for H2 recombination in the catalytic cycle involving [HGa(OH)(O)Ga]2+ species."

[10] "Although earlier isolated mononuclear GaO+ have been proposed as the active sites in Ga-containing high-silica zeolites, the present results indicate that such species should oligomerize in the microporous space, independent of the Al distribution."

[1] "Supported vanadium oxide catalysts, containing surface vanadia species on oxide supports, are extensively employed as catalysts for many hydrocarbon oxidation reactions."

[2] "The molecular structures of these surface vanadia species are tentatively thought to consist of a terminal V=O bond and three bridging V-O-support bonds for the isolated species, and a terminal V=O bond with one bridging V-O-support and two bridging V-O-V bonds for the polymerized species."

[3] "The bridging V-O-support bond appears to be associated with the critical oxygen required for hydrocarbon oxidation reactions since changing the specific oxide support dramatically affects the TOF: approximately four orders of magnitude for methanol oxidation to formaldehyde and two-orders of magnitude for butane oxidation to maleic anhydride."

[4] "The general trend appears to be CeOz>ZrO2 TiO2>NbzOs>A12Os>SiO2, which inversely correlates with the Sanderson electronegativity of the oxide support cations."

[5] "As a result of these physical and chemical characteristics, supported vanadia catalysts tend to be among the most active and selective supported metal oxide catalysts for hydrocarbon oxidation reactions."

[6] "The oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propylene over V2O5/Nb2O5 was not dependent on the concentration of the bridging V-O-V bonds"

[7] "Oxidation reactions requiring only one surface vanadia sites are generally not sensitive to the surface vanadia coverage and the presence of noninteracting metal oxide additives. Oxidation reactions requiring multiple surface vanadia sites are very sensitive to surface vanadia coverage and the presence of noninteracting metal oxide additives."

[8] "The addition of surface niobia is especially informative since it has a minimal effect on the surface vanadia structure, see Section 5.6 above, and its presence primarily increases the number of adjacent surface metal oxide sites for the surface vanadia species."

[9] "Interacting additives affect all hydrocarbon oxidation reactions since they directly alter the structure and reactivity of the surface vanadia sites."

[10] "Acidic and basic additives also influence the selectivity of hydrocarbon oxidation reactions, but the effect appears to be reaction specific and cannot be generalized with the limited data currently available."

[1] "Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts are most active and selective for the aromatisation of propane [1]. It is widely accepted that their activity and selectivity result from their bifunctional properties, whereby gallium species are responsible for their dehydrogenation-hydrogenation activity and the Brönsted acid sites of the zeolite provide the centres necessary for chain growth."

[2] "Recently, it was shown that dual active sites are responsible for the activation of propane on Ga/H-ZSM-5 [2-4]. These dual active sites consist of highly dispersed (Ga3+, O2-) ions pairs, acting in synergy with neighbouring Brönsted sites which initially activate propane as a protonated pseudo-cyclopropane species."

[3] "Changes in the propane aromatisation activity and selectivity of these catalysts as a function of the number of reaction (reducing conditions)-regeneration (oxidative conditions) cycles sustained were explained by the migration of gallium species in and out of the zeolite intracrystalline void space [5] as substantiated by detailed catalyst characterisation [6]."

[4] "Hydrogen treatment increases activity and selectivity to aromatics while decreasing the formation of methane. Subsequent oxygen treatment enhances further the activity and aromatics selectivity and has little effect on methane selectivity."

[5] "These improvements of catalytic performance are explained by gallium migration in reducing conditions. The concentration of highly dispersed gallium species is thereby enhanced. These species, in association with Brønsted centers, were reported previously to constitute the dual catalytic sites responsible for alkane activation."

[6] "Several authors have also reported the inhibitory effect of hydrogen on propane transformation over Zn/H-ZSM-5 [24] and Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts [25]. A possible explanation is that the limiting step of the propane dehydrogenation is the removal of hydrogen [26]."

[7] "H2-O2 pretreatment thus appear to be a promising way to preactivate and stabilise Ga-modified aromatisation catalysts in commercial operation."

[1] "This review paper presents the significant advances which were made in the last decade in the understanding of the transformation over acid and bifunctional zeolite catalysts of the cheap and readily available C2C4 alkanes into more valuable products: mechanism of activation, reaction scheme, nature of the active sites."

[1] "Previous studies have shown that supported vanadia is the most active and selective simple metal oxide for alkane ODH, because its reducible nature leads to the rapid redox cycles required for a catalytic turnover (15)."

[2] "UVvisible spectroscopy suggests that V5+ is present in distorted tetrahedrally coordinated species at low vanadia surface densities and that some of these tetrahedrally coordinated cations remain at higher surface densities, coexisting with an increasing fraction of V5+ present in distorted tetragonal pyramidal coordination, similar to that present in V2O5 (25)."

[3] "For both ethane and propane reactants, these apparent turnover rates reach a maximum at intermediate vanadia surface densities. The maximum rate is reached at a surface VOx density of 8 V/nm2 for both reactants, and this maximum rate is about four times greater than that obtained on the VOx/Al2O3 sample with the lowest surface density (1.4 V/nm2)."

[4] "Ethane ODH at zero conversion is 75% selective to ethene and insensitive to vanadia surface density, while initial propene selectivities during propane ODH approach 90% at low vanadia surface densities, but decrease with increasing vanadia surface density."

[5] "Therefore, the highest olefin yields are obtained on catalysts containing isolated monovanadates and operated at the highest possible reaction temperature consistent with the avoidance of homogeneous reactions."

[6] "VOx/Al2O3 catalysts were prepared by incipient wetness impregnation of fumed γ-alumina (Degussa, AG, 100 m2/g) with an aqueous solution of ammonium metavanadate (99%, Aldrich, Inc.) and oxalic acid (Mallinckrodt analytical grade) in a 1 : 2 weight ratio (12) with a pH of 2."

[7] "Reaction rate and selectivity data were measured in a packed-bed flow reactor with plug-flow hydrodynamics (24). VOx/Al2O3 catalysts (0.010.3 g) were diluted with quartz granules (180- to 355-m diameter, 0.010.3 g) in order to prevent bed temperature gradients."

[8] "Ethane ODH reactions were examined at 663743 K, while the faster propane ODH reactions were examined at lower temperatures (603663 K)."

[1] "Isolated molybdate species supported on silica are reported to have the highest specific activity and selectivity for the direct oxidation of methane to formaldehyde."

[2] "On the basis of evidence from extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) and Raman spectroscopy, the Mo atoms in this catalyst are present as isolated, pentacoordinated molybdate species containing a single MoO bond."

[3] "It is proposed that peroxides are produced by the reaction of O2 with a small concentration of reduced molybdate species and that the reaction of CH4 with these peroxide species leads to the formation of formaldehyde."

[4] "Low concentrations of H2O were observed to enhance the activity of MoOx/SiO2 for CH4 oxidation to formaldehyde."

[5] "During CH4 oxidation to formaldehyde, the catalyst undergoes only a very small degree of reduction and typically only 50500 ppm of MoVI is reduced to MoIV."

[6] "It was established that treatment of MoOx/SiO2 at 873 K under pure methane reduces the dispersed molybdate species to only a limited extent and results mainly in the deposition of amorphous carbon."

[1] "Catalytic reactions of hydrocarbons in zeolites can be profoundly affected by extraframework transition-metal cationic clusters. MFI zeolites containing dehydrogenating species such as gallium, zinc, and platinum form the basis for light alkane aromatization (Cyclar, Aroforming, Z-forming) processes."

[2] "The water-induced enhancement in the rate of alkane activation by Ga/ZSM-5, as discussed herein, relates to transformation of these single Ga+ centers to binuclear cationic Ga complexes involving a Ga2O22+ core."

[3] "Clearly, cofeeding of water leads to a substantial increase of the propane conversion. The conversion passes a maximum at p of 0.3kPa. Catalyst performance in the presence of steam (0.3kPa) was found to be stable over a period of at least 4h."

[4] "Addition of water to the feed strongly increases the activity. The main product remains propylene, although with increasing water content slightly increased amounts of methane and ethylene are formed."

[5] "The promoting effect of water is due to the formation of reactive partly hydrolyzed gallium species. For mononuclear gallium sites, the catalytic cycle is initiated by desorption of H2 from [Ga3+(H)(OH)]+ to form the GaO+ ion."

[6] "Dehydrogenation of an alkane over the Ga2O2 dimer proceeds by initial heterolytic dissociation by the Lewis acid pair formed by Ga3+ and the basic extraframework oxygen atom (Scheme1) with subsequent olefin desorption and hydrogen recombination."

[7] "In summary, addition of water to reduced Ga cations stabilizes binuclear hydroxyl-bridged Ga-containing cationic reaction intermediates. The increased acidity of the bridging hydroxyl bond and the stable tetrahedral configuration around Ga3+ ions facilitate H2 desorption."

[1] "The oxidation of n-butane to maleic anhydride is the only industrial process of selective oxidation of a paraffin."

[2] "Fixed-bed: mving-bed:- and fluidized-bed reactors all use the same type of catalyst, (VO)2P207, and no other catalytic composition has been successfully proposed."

[3] "The catalytic behavior of the V-P-based catalysts depends on the following main factors: Method of preparation of the precursor (type of reagents, reducing agents, and solvent; temperature, and dry or wet milling); P/V ratio; Presence of additives; and Methodology of activation and conditioning of the precursor at high temperature."

[4] "Catalysts with a slight excess of phosphorus (P/V=1.05) exhibit the right compromise between reducibility and reoxidizability necessary to obtain both high activity and high selectivity."

[5] "By means of XPS analysis, many inestigators, with the exception of Okuhara et al., have found a higher P/V ratio (in the range 1.5 to 3) on the surface than in the bulk."

[6] "There is a general agreement that a high P/V ratio helps in avoiding the oxidation of V4+ in (VO)2P2O7."

[7] "Since 1974 n-butane has been increasingly used in place of benzene as the raw material for maleic anhydride production for the following reasons: Lower price, High availability in many regions, and Nontoxicity."

[1] "Two Mo/HZSM-5 catalyst series have been tested in the partial oxidation of methane to formaldehyde at atmospheric pressure."

[2] "Two different molybdenum species were detected in these catalysts: tetrahedral monomeric Mo(VI) species and octahedral coordinated polymolybdate species."

[3] "For molybdenum loading higher than 1.3 wt.%, polymolybdate species are predominant causing a decrease in the dispersion and a partial blocking up of the HZSM-5 zeolite channels."

[4] "Both catalyst series show different activity in methane conversion. Polymolybdate species of impregnated Mo/HZSM-5 catalysts are more reactive in methane activation than acid sites of HZSM-5 but lead to low HCOH selectivity values."

[5] "In contrast, treated catalysts show lower methane conversion but higher HCOH selectivity. These results demonstrate the specificity of the Mo=O sites of monomeric species for HCOH production."

[6] "It seems to be a general agreement in the catalytic role of each active site in the methane partial oxidation [6,911]. Thus, Mo=O sites of terminal atoms in molybdenum oxide crystallites or isolated monomeric species seem to be specific sites for HCOH production, while MoOMo sites of polymolybdate species and MoO3 cluster would lead to the total oxidation products."

[7] "A well-dispersed molybdenum oxide phase mainly constituted of tetrahedral monomeric species joined to the zeolite surface was characterized."

[1] "The best results were obtained for a simple reaction, the oxidation of benzene to phenol over Fe-containing ZSM-5 zeolites. It proceeds with nearly 100% selectivity at 25-30% benzene conversion."

[2] "Supported oxides of vanadium, molybdenum and tungsten demonstrated the best results. At 550°C in the presence of 30% water vapor in the gas flow, the vanadia catalyst provided a 71.5% selectivity towards phenol at 10.6% benzene conversion."

[3] "Results obtained over zeolites were rather unexpected. Table 2 shows catalytic properties of some zeolites tested under conditions similar to those for vanadia catalysts. A considerable amount of phenol was obtained in several cases. Especially interesting results were observed over AlPO4 and ZSM-5 zeolites."

[4] "ZSM-5 zeolites to be promising catalytic systems for benzene oxidation to phenol by dinitrogen monoxide. These catalysts allowed the reaction to proceed within a 300-400°C temperature range without water addition into the reaction mixture. Moreover, they provided a very high selectivity towards phenol."

[5] "Fig. 4 shows benzene conversion as a function of iron content in Fe-Al-Si samples plotted with the data of ref. 57. In fact, the samples Fe(Al)-0.004 and Fe(Al)-0.007 containing an extremely small amount of Fe (0.004 and 0.007 wt.-%, correspondingly) exhibit a very low activity. As iron content grows up to ca. 0.1 wt.-% of Fe2O3, benzene conversion increases considerably and then reaches a plateau with minor subsequent changes."

[6] "Properties of α-oxygen were studied in a number of papers [31,32,60-64] and were shown to be as follows:
1. It is formed on Fe-ZSM-5 zeolites and not on Fe2O3 or other iron-containing catalysts tested.
2. It is loosely bonded to the surface, the value of the bond energy being anomalously low.
3. It is thermally stable up to 300°C; above this point it desorbs irreversibly into the gas phase.
4. It is produced upon dinitrogen monoxide decomposition but not upon oxygen adsorption.
5. It exhibits high reactivity: at room temperature it is involved in oxygen isotopic exchange as well as in oxidation of carbon monoxide and methane."

[7] "Referring to ref. 59, the ability to produce the α-form of the surface oxygen is the main specific peculiarity of dinitrogen monoxide as an oxidant."

[1] "The catalytic dehydrocondensation of methane to benzene and naphthalene with a bulky of hydrogen on transition metal supported zeolite catalysts is one of strategies for the catalytic conversion of methane and a challenging topic in heterogeneous catalysis."

[2] "Wang et al. [11] reported that methane could be transformed to benzene in a flow mode reactor on transition metal ions supported HZSM-5 catalysts under non-oxidative condition."

[3] "It is generally accepted that the Mo/HZSM-5 is one of the good catalysts as reported by groups of Xu and co-workers [13,14], Chen et al. [15], Solymosi et al. [1619], Wang et al. [20,21], and Liu et al. [22,23]."

[4] "Weckhuysen et al. [26] studied the effect of transition metal ions, the preparation and treatment method. They found that the activity is in the following sequence: Mo > W > Fe > V > Cr."

[5] "Zhang et al. studied the methane aromatization over Mo-based catalysts supported on different types of zeolites [32]. It was found that H-type silicaalumina zeolites, such as ZSM-5, ZSM-8, ZSM-11 and β-zeolite, were effective supports for Mo-based catalysts"

[6] "During the past 8 years, the catalyst modification in term of zeolite micropores was extensively studied [23,3237]. Some of typical results are listed in Table 1."

[1] "Coaromatization of methane and light hydrocarbons (paraffins and olefins) at 700800K is one of the alternative methods for the conversion of methane."

[2] "It has been reported recently that the conversion of methane during coaromatization with higher alkanes or alkenes (C2C6) at 670870K in the presence of bifunctional catalysts (mainly, high-silica ZSM-5 or ZSM-11 zeolites, modified with gallium or zinc) may reach 2040%."

[3] "Our data show that the activation of methane on Zn/H-BEA indeed occurs at 523K through the formation of a surface methoxy species (a stabilized methyl cation) (δ=58ppm8 in the 13C CP/MAS NMR spectrum, Figure3a). The initial activation of methane also gives a Zn-CH3 species (δ=21ppm9)."

[4] "The dissociation of methane on ZnO species may be facilitated by neighboring acidic sites of the zeolite."

[5] "The role of the higher hydrocarbon consists of producing aromatic compounds, which further serve as a trap for the methoxy species formed from methane on the Zn sites (Scheme1a)."

[6] "Thus, the main pathway for the conversion of methane into aromatic compounds during the course of the methane and propane co-conversion represents the alkylation of propane-originating aromatic molecules by 13CH4."

[1] "Depending on the vanadium loadings, different vanadium oxide species (V5+) were formed on the surface of alumina after calcination. Mainly isolated and polymerized VO4 units were observed at coverages up to a monolayer [1,5,13] while VO6 octahedra were predominant on catalyst surfaces at higher vanadium loadings [1]."

[2] "The molecular structure of the surface vanadium oxide species and the catalytic properties are influenced by the method of preparation, the nature of support, promotors and environmental conditions [1]."

[3] "It is suggested that both isolated and polymerized tetrahedrally coordinated V5+ species are active in propane dehydrogenation. The AlVO4 phase and bulk-like V2O5 have only a low catalytic activity."

[4] "The highest propene selectivity was obtained for the sample with the highest dispersion of the isolated and polymerized tetrahedrally coordinated V5+ species."

[5] "Propene selectivity depends on the dispersion of the tetrahedrally coordinated V5+ species; the higher the dispersion, the higher the propene selectivity. CO is the main product of propene oxidation and its formation increases with decreasing dispersion of active sites."

[6] "Vanadium species formed on the alumina support after calcination between 773 and 973 K at vanadium loadings between 4.45 and 13.2 wt.% were characterized with different methods (51V NMR, ESR, H2-TPR and in situ UVvis-DRS) and tested in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane."

[7] "By calcination at 873 K, beside dispersed isolated and polymerized V5+ surface species mainly in tetrahedral coordination, a crystalline AlVO4 phase was formed. The portion of vanadium present as AlVO4 increases with increasing vanadium loadings (e.g. about 60 at 13.2 wt.%)."

[8] "Initial propane reaction rate (Table 5) has the highest values for the samples V(8.9/773), V(4.5/873) and V(8.9/873). In these samples, dispersed isolated and polymerized tetrahedrally coordinated V5+ species dominate."

[1] "Copper-exchanged ZSM-5 zeolite (CuZSM-5) is known to exhibit a high catalytic activity in the selective decomposition of NO into molecular oxygen and nitrogen."

[2] "The copper adsorption centers could be formed both in an indirect way after reduction of dimeric oxygen-bridged [CuOCu]21 species or directly by high-temperature reaction of the hydrogen form with the CuCl vapour at elevated temperature."

[3] "As a possible site for Cu1 localization the six-membered ring composed of two five-membered rings on the walls of the straight channels of the ZSM-5 zeolite (the a-site) was chosen."

[4] "Adsorption of C2H6 can take place at the Cu1Z site both in Z1 and Z2 geometries."

[5] "The bonding in such [Cu1(Z2-C2H6)]Z complexes could be rationalized by a synergetic combination of ligand-to-metal electron donation from CH s-orbitals to the partially-occupied Cu1 s-orbital combined with metal-to-ligand back-donation from the copper dp-orbitals to CH s* orbitals."

[1] "Unpromoted HZSM-5 is, however, a poor dehydrogenation catalyst; addition of promoters is required for such application."

[2] "Modification of the zeolite with zinc or gallium has been successful for this purpose."

[3] "For the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane and n-butane, it has been reported that the alkene yield is highest over Fe3+ silicalite, and rapid cracking and combustion of propane occurred over ion-exchanged Fe/ZSM-5 and FeOx/silicalite."

[4] "Upon condensation of the vapor of a volatile precursor on the H-form of the zeolite, the concentration of Brnsted sites is lowered drastically and a high level of ion exchange is obtained. Subsequent treatment with H2O to remove chlorine from the precursor induces hydrolysis of the metal ions."

[5] "Hydrolysis converts naked ions into oxo ions, such as (GaO)+ and (HOFeOFeOH)2+. They are identified by temperature-programmed reduction with H2 and CO and, in the case of the binuclear Fe3+ ion, by ESR spectroscopy."

[6] "The Ga2O3 clusters are easily reduced to Ga+ at 450 C. With (HOFeOFeOH)2+ in cationic exchange positions reduction is reversible at 500 C."

[7] "In the case of Zn/ZSM-5, isolated Zn2+ cations compensate the charge of two Al-centered tetrahedra or attach themselves to one silanol group or ZnOH and one Al-centered tetrahedron. In this state, the Zn ions are stabilized and cannot be reduced below 800 C."

[8] "When Ga, Zn, and Fe replace protons in HZSM-5, they form strong Lewis acid sites."

[1] "Iron complexes in the ZSM-5 zeolite matrix (α-centers) are shown to perform single-turnover cycles of methane oxidation to methanol at room temperature when nitrous oxide is used as a source of oxygen."

[2] "FeZSM-5 zeolite containing iron complexes that form under thermal activation (called α-centers [7]) is able to perform single-turnover cycles of selective methane oxidation to methanol at room temperature when nitrous oxide (N2O) is the source of oxygen."

[3] "At temperatures lower than 573 K, N2O decomposition on α-centers quantitatively follows reaction (1): N2O + ( )α = (O)α + N2, loading the active centers with α-oxygen [7]."

[4] "There are α-centers whose activity gives FeZSM-5 zeolites a unique ability to catalyze direct oxidation of benzene to phenol with nitrous oxide at 573-623 K, providing nearly 100 % selectivity [9,14]."

[5] "Binuclear iron centers are a particular feature of MMO compared to the mononuclear centers of other monooxygenases [1]. There is some indirect evidence favoring the binuclear structure of the active iron complexes in the ZSM-5 matrix"

[1] "We report here the preparation of a new catalyst for the partial oxidation of methane by grafting of MoO2(acac)2 (acac: acetylacetonate ligand) onto the surface of acidic HZSM-5 zeolite."

[2] "It was shown by FT-IR spectroscopy that the reaction takes place between the acidic hydroxyl groups of the zeolite and the acetylacetonate ligands of the complex."

[3] "As a consequence of this reaction, and by avoiding the presence of water, isolated oxo species of molybdenum in oxidation state VI were obtained with a large dispersion."

[4] "On account of the specific activity of these isolated MoO42species, the new grafted Mo/HZSM-5 catalyst greatly improves the formaldehyde yield in the methane partial oxidation reaction with respect to those of the classical impregnated W and Mo/HZSM-5 catalysts."

[5] "Grafting of transition metal complexes onto reactive surface structures is an expeditious alternative method to obtain catalytic systems with definable structure and composition"

[6] "The authors have reported the partial oxidation of methane to formaldehyde over W and Mo/HZSM-5 catalysts prepared by conventional aqueous impregnation [13,14]. It was shown that three different types of metal oxide species are present in these catalysts, the relative amount of each one varying with the metal loading: tetrahedral monomeric species, octahedral polymeric species and metal oxide crystallites."

[7] "The weakness of the CH bond of methane, caused by distortion of the methane molecule through its interaction with the zeolite surface, has been proposed as the first step in the methane activation mechanism [10]."

[8] "Formaldehyde selectivity was dependent on the dispersion and the nature of metal oxide supported phase."

[9] "Several authors have reported the specificity of M=O and MOM sites (M: Mo, V) in the production of HCOH and carbon oxides, respectively, from methane over MoO3 and V2O5 silica-supported catalysts [32,33,3638]."

[1] "ZnMFI catalyzes dehydrogenation and aromatization of light paraffins, etc."

[2] "Unlike ion exchange or incipient wetness impregnation, the reaction of hydrogen forms of MFI with zinc vapour at 773 K results in the practically complete substitution of protons by zinc ions."

[3] "The catalytic properties of high-silica zeolites modified with bivalent cations are quite different from those of faujasites containing the same cations."

[4] "Zinc or other bivalent ions with only partially compensated positive charges exhibit an unusually high chemical activity. This explains the specific catalytic and adsorption properties of high-silica zeolites modified with the bivalent transition metal cations."

[5] "Our recent results also demonstrated that MFI modified with bivalent Zn or Co cations possess unusual adsorption properties. For instance, low-frequency shifts of HH stretching vibrations of molecular hydrogen adsorbed by these ions at 77 K exceed 200 cm1."

[6] "Application of low temperature H2 adsorption as a molecular probe indicated that similar sites of unusual localization of bivalent zinc cations also exist in zeolites modified by ion exchange or incipient wetness impregnation, but the amount of such sites is less than for the samples modified by reaction with zinc vapour."

[7] "Complete substitution of protons indicates that at high Si/Al ratios some of the Zn2 cations are localized at the isolated aluminium occupied oxygen tetrahedra with single negative charges. This results in the formation of sites with only partially compensated excessive positive charges of bivalent cations."

[1] "The oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of propane over a supported vanadia catalyst is of great interest because of its importance in industrial catalysis."

[2] "Experimental studies of catalyst structure (25) generally agree that when the concentration of vanadium oxide species is low, isolated VO4 units form on the support surface. These units are assumed to contain a vertical VO double bond and three bridging VOS linkages, where S represents the support metal cation (S = Al, Si, Ti, etc.)."

[3] "The dependence of the reactivity on coverage of the support surface by vanadium oxide is unclear in the literature."

[4] "Experimental studies of the ODH reaction with supported vanadia catalysts have generally supported the reaction mechanism originally proposed by Mars and van Krevelen."

[5] "The experimental barriers for propane ODH on supported vanadium oxide are in the range 2030 kcal/mol, (4,10,22) which are much lower than the value of about 80 kcal/mol found in this study for the water elimination step."

[6] "Our results point toward a possible reason as to why the interaction of vanadium oxide with a support may lower the barrier for the initial dissociative adsorption of propane and propene elimination steps in the ODH reaction pathways investigated here"

[7] "We have carried out a hybrid density functional study of mechanisms for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane on the (010) surface of V2O5. The surface was modeled using both vanadium oxide clusters and a periodic slab."

[8] "The potential energy surface is found to have large barriers, which are lowered somewhat when the possibility of a triplet state is considered."

[9] "The barriers on the reaction pathway are 4580 kcal/mol above the energy of the reactants, which are much larger than found experimentally for propane ODH on supported vanadia."

[1] "It has been found that, when propane is used as the reactant at 5OOC and 0.1 MPa, the BTX selectivity can be increased from ca. 10% (H-ZSM-5) to ca. 40 to 45% after treatment of the base zeolite with solutions of zinc or gallium nitrate, such that the final zinc or gallium content is ca. 1.0 mass-%."

[2] "On Zn-ZSM-5 part of the hydrogen atom pool lost on aromatization is released as dihydrogen and an improved BTX selectivity results."

[3] "It appears that Ga-ZSM-5 or GaZn-ZSM-5 catalysts operate in a similar manner, but gallium-containing samples are preferred since zinc volatilization occurs at the reaction temperatures used for samples containing zinc alone."

[4] "The contact time has been shown to have a strong influence on the product distribution obtained in these systems. To summarize, the observed selectivity to aromatics depends on the form of the zeolite used and on the contact time."

[5] "A comparative study of the conversion of propane, n-butane and i-butane over Zn-ZSM-5 reveals that the alkanes differ in terms of activity and BTX selectivity. i-Butane is the most reactive of the three alkanes and also yields the highest percentage hydrogen recovery as dihydrogen. However, it displays the lowest BTX selectivity."

[1] "Incorporation of zinc cations into high-silica zeolites enhances the selectivity of zeolite catalysts towards light alkane dehydrogenation and aromatization [13]."

[2] "It seems that the incorporated Zn2+ cations act as strong Lewis sites and change the mechanism of the alkane activation and transformation favoring a hydrogen removal step [2, 410]."

[3] "Analysis of the results on characterization of zinc species suggested that Zn/H-MFI involves three types of Zn species: small and large ZnO clusters and zinc cations."

[4] "For Zn/H-MFI sample used in this study with high Zn content, (OZ)(ZnOZn)2+(OZ) or (ZO)Zn+OSi cations should preferably form based on the literature data [2, 22]. However, the presence of Zn2+ or ZnOH+ cannot be excluded."

[5] "The mechanism of H/D exchange for propane involving Zn2+ cations is shown on Scheme 3. Zn2+ cations located at neighbouring [4] or distanly separated [10] basic oxygens of the Si O Al groups in the zeolite framework provide a heterolytic dissociative adsorption of propane and offer Zn-propyl species and acid protons of the SiOHAl group."

[6] "Regioselectivity of the exchange for Zn/H-MFI implies that the mechanism of the exchange changes, when the zeolite is modified with Zn."

[7] "For the case with Zn- containing H-MFI, the dehydrogenation of propane molecule to form carbenium ion can occur either on zinc cations or Lewis sites of subnanomeric custers of ZnO due to prevalence of these two Zn species in the zeolite [1, 23, 2629]."

[1] "The initial step in propane activation over Zn/H-MFI is dissociative adsorption over zinc oxide sites, leading to the formation of propyl zinc species and ZnOH groups."

[2] "At low partial pressure of the reactants, H2 recombinative desorption and hydrogen evolution is favoured, whereas at high pressures, implied under NMR batch conditions, the hydrogenolysis route is preferred."

[3] "The mechanism proposed for propane activation involves propane dissociation, followed by propene evolution and recombinative desorption of dihydrogen. Propene further oligomerizes over acidic sites, while dihydrogen either evolves as a final product or participates in propane hydrogenolysis into ethane and methane."

[4] "This mechanistic pathway explains the higher activity of Zn/H-MFI catalysts with respect to H-MFI and the lower selectivity to aromatics in comparison to Ga/H-MFI."

[5] "The development of in situ MAS NMR spectroscopic techniques [11] has allowed monitoring of the catalytic transformations directly on a catalyst surface during the course of the reaction."

[6] "Application of in situ 13C MAS NMR spectroscopy has enabled identification of the proposed detailed bifunctional mechanism of propane activation over Ga-modified acidic MFI zeolite [11a,11c,11e,12]."

"Recently we reported that silica supported zirconium hydride species was capable of room temperature activation of carbon-hydrogen bonds [1,2] and of the low temperature hydrogenolysis of alkanes to methane and ethane [2-4]."

"The exceptional properties of this catalyst in the field of C-H and C-C bond activation are ascribed to the very electrophilic (formally 8 electron) and sterically unhindered (four coordinate) nature of the zirconium hydride complex."

"The stoichiometric reaction between propane and (=- SiO)3ZrH leads to the formation of a mixture of (=- SiO)3ZrCH(CH3)2 and (-= SiO)3ZrCH2CH2CH3."

"The catalytic deuteration of propane by deuterium at room temperature catalysed by (=- SiO)3ZrH showed that the primary C-H bonds of propane reacted seven times faster than the secondary C-H bonds."

[1] "For supported metal oxides, it has been observed empirically that the decline in olefin selectivity with increasing alkane conversion decreases with increasing basicity of the support."

[2] "Figure 5 shows that the effects of the phosphorus/vanadium ratio on the selectivity of maleic anhydride formation via butane oxidation over supported vanadium phosphate catalysts."

[3] "The selectivity to maleic anhydride increases monotonically with increasing P/V (phosphorus/vanadium) ratio. Near-edge analysis of X-ray absorption spectra taken during butane oxidation suggest that the high selectivity to maleic anhydride observed when P/V = 2 is associated with the stabilization of a high proportion of the V in the 4+ oxidation state."

[4] "Figure 5 shows that while the value of k1 increases with increasing domain size, the ratio of k2/k1 decreases and the ratio of k3/k1 is independent of domain size. These results indicate that ODH requires large vanadia domains."

[5] "Cu/ZSM-5, where ZSM-5 is a type of zeolite with an MFI structure. Its activity is suppressed significantly by water vapor, which is present at 10% in engine exhaust. Fe/ZSM-5 is also very active and selective, and its activity remains high in the presence of water vapor"

[6] "For these catalysts, heating above the normal operating temperature must be prevented by proper engineering because of the low zeolite hydrothermal stability at high temperatures. In addition, the operating temperature window of these catalysts is rather narrow, and their efficiency depends on the nature of the hydrocarbon reductant. They are also sensitive to sulfur poisoning."

[7] "It is known that hydrothermal degradation of catalysts is associated with dealumination of the zeolite and migration and agglomeration of the metal ions and oxo complexes."

[1] "The catalytic activity of ZSM-5 is greatly improved by incorporating a metal cation (Mo or Zn)."
          [2] "MoHZSM-5 exhibited the best activity, while neither MoNaZSM-5 nor MoO3 has any activity for the reaction."
          [3] "The starting temperature for the dehydro-aromatization of methane over MoHZSM-5 is about 973 K, which is about 50 K lower than that over ZnHZSM-5."
          [4] "Ethene and H2 can be directly detected from TPAR and both evolved over MoHZSM-5 at about 973 K, which is the same temperature at which benzene evolved."
          [5] "The Mo modified ZSM-5 catalysts exhibited excellent catalytic activity and selectivity to benzene for the conversion of methane at 973 K under non-oxidizing conditions."
          [6] "We suggest that the activation of methane over HZSM-5 and MHZSM-5 zeolite catalysts is via the carbenium ion mechanism."
          [7] "In the case of ZnHZSM-5 catalyst, Zn2+ cations act as a hybride acceptor to give [Zn-H]+,"
          [8] "In the case of MoHZSM-5 catalyst, Mo6+ species in ZSM-5 zeolite may act as hybride acceptor to give [Mo-H]5+,"

[1] "Supported vanadium oxides are one of the best catalysts for the ODH of propane with high thermal stability and the large surface area."

          [2] "Generally, the activity and selectivity of the catalyst depends on its reducibility and basicity."

          [3] "To achieve high activity and selectivity the presence of highly dispersed vanadium is crucial."

          [4] "For a good catalyst, there is a compromise between the activity in CH bond activation and the easiness to release the propene molecule from the surface."

          [5] "From our study, for example, the reducibility of the O(2) site is indeed much facilitated by other surface atoms, which is a rather long-range effect."

          [6] "In supported catalysts, multiple lattice O species are available, including VO, VOV, and VOM sites (M is the metal cation from oxide supports). This introduces much flexibility in controlling the catalyst activity as the electronic structures of the two-coordinated O and the terminal VO in these systems can be very different from the V2O5 bulk."

          [7] "It is found that at low loadings vanadium is molecularly dispersed, whereas at higher loadings V2O5 crystallites start to appear."

          [8] "Overall, the vanadyl oxygen O(1) on the V2O5(001) surface is slightly more reactive in CH bond activation than is the O(2) atom. However, the propoxide on the O(2) is much easier to further decompose into propene."

          [9] "For the ODH reaction, the high activities in activating CH bond and in producing propene are two properties acting negatively to each other. It is expected that the activity of the oxide-supported vanadium can be tuned by controlling the polymerization extent and the support materials."

[1] "Silica-supported zirconium hydrides exhibit high activity towards olefin isomerization under mild conditions."

[2] "Recently it has been demonstrated that metal oxide-bound organozirconium complexes (1) [1, 2] undergo hydrogenolysis [3] to yield attached zirconium hydrides (2) which are highly active catalysts for ethylene polymerization."

[3] "We find that these supported organozirconium compounds inefficiently catalyze the isomerization of 1-butene to cis- and trans-2-butene at room temperature. However, high rates of isomerization are realized if the supported zirconium alkyl compounds are first hydrogenated."

[4] "The isomerization catalyst system derived from 2 is long lived either upon standing or under isomerization reaction conditions provided that air and water are rigorously excluded."

[5] "Rates of isomerization are sterically controlled, decreasing in the order 1-butene > 1-hexene > allylbenzene > methylenecyclohexane"

[6] "When a twentyfold molar excess of 1-butene was added to a toluene slurry of the catalyst, hydrogenation (H2, 1 atm, 25°C) to butane was complete within 30 h."

[1] "The activation of ethane over zinc- and gallium-modified HZSM-5 dehydrogenation catalysts was studied by diffuse reflectance infrared spectroscopy."

[2] "Hydrocarbon activation on HZSM-5 modified by bivalent Zn and univalent Ga cations proceeds via two distinctly different mechanisms."

[3] "The stronger molecular adsorption of ethane by the acidbase pairs formed by distantly separated cationic Zn21 and basic oxygen sites results already at room temperature in strong polarizability of adsorbed ethane and subsequent heterolytic dissociative adsorption at moderate temperatures."

[4] "In contrast, molecular adsorption of ethane on Ga1 cations is weak. At high temperatures dissociative hydrocarbon adsorption takes place, resulting in the formation of ethyl and hydride fragments coordinating to the cationic gallium species."

[5] "Whereas in the zinc case a Brnsted acid proton is formed upon ethane dissociation, decomposition of the ethyl fragment on gallium results in gallium dihydride species and does not lead to Brnsted acid protons."

[6] "This difference in alkane activation has direct consequences for hydrocarbon conversions involving dehydrogenation."

[7] "Zn/ZSM-5 displays a much higher conversion than Ga/ZSM-5. This corresponds to the finding that ethane is more readily activated over the zincoxygen acidbase pairs than over Ga1 cations."

[1] "Silica-supported zirconium hydrides15 draw recently much attention due to their ability to catalyse low-temperature olefin polymerization,12 CC bond hydrogenolysis in alkanes3 and polyolefins4 under mild conditions and H/D isotope exchange in alkanes.56"

[2] "Basset et al.36 considered the catalytic sites of alkane hydrogenolysis to be grafted zirconium monohydrides (SiO)3ZrH. On the other hand, Yermakov et al.1,2 considered grafted zirconium dihydrides (SiO)2ZrH2 as the catalytic sites in this system."

[3] "Thus, we concluded that zirconium dihydrides 2, which existence was postulated in 1977 by Yermakov et al.,2 unlike zirconium monohydrides 1, are capable to catalyse alkane hydrogenolysis under mild conditions."

[4] "A DFT study of CC bond hydrogenolysis in alkanes on silica-supported zirconium monohydrides (SiO)3ZrH and dihydrides (SiO)2ZrH2 shows that only the latter are capable of catalysing this process under mild conditions."

[5] "The data suggest that the hydrogenolysis of butane cannot proceed under mild conditions on supported zirconium monohydrides 1 by the Basset mechanism. The process is unfavourable from both kinetic and thermodynamic points of view."

[1] "Modification of these zeolites with Zn2+ ions inhibits cracking and increases the rate and selectivity of aromatization."

[2] "It is generally believed that this is connected with acceleration by the modifying Zn2+ ions of dehydrogenation of both light paraffins and the growing chains of oligomers."

[3] "For spectral measurements, the granulated zeolites with particle dimensions of 0.51 mm were transferred into another part of the optical cell equipped with a CaF2 window."

[4] "Reaction with zinc vapor at 770 K resulted in almost complete disappearance of both the narrow and the broad bands (the dashed line in Figure 1)."

[5] "Below 453 K such dissociative adsorption is irreversible, since the bands from the chemisorbed alkyl species and protons were not removed, even by a very prolonged evacuation."

[6] "The resulting ethylene is most likely involved in a subsequent reaction with acidic protons yielding the grafted oligomeric species that, after heating of the sample at high temperature, contributes to the DRIFT spectrum in the region of CH stretching vibrations."

"The high temperature oxidation of CH4 to HCHO may be carried out over pure SiO2 and V2O5/SiO5. In the single-pass mode, the HCHO yields do not exceed 34%; however, respectable spacetime-yields (STY) of about 1200 g/kg cat h at 30% selectivity have been achieved over a 2% V2O5/SiO2 catalyst at 600C [20]."

"Several bifunctional catalysts are known to promote this reaction, with the most thoroughly studied being a Mo/H-ZSM-5 zeolite [3538]."

"Most investigators agree that molybdenum carbide or oxycarbide is responsible for the conversion of CH4 to C2H4 and that the C2H4 is converted to aromatic products over the acidic sites within the channels of the zeolite."

"A W, Zn/H-ZSM-5 catalyst, prepared by Zhang and co-workers [38] via a controlled impregnation technique, is of particular interest because a CH4 conversion of 23% at 850C, with high benzene selectivity, has been observed."

"Over the better catalysts, which include SrO/La2O3 [25] and Mn/Na2WO4/SiO2 [26,27], a C2 selectivity of about 80% can be achieved at a CH4 conversion of 20%."

"Other metals including W and Fe are effective for promoting this reaction, and there is evidence that these metals are active as suboxides, rather than as carbides [37]."

[1] "Oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes provides a thermodynamically accessible route to the synthesis of alkenes from alkanes (13). Supported vanadium oxides (VOx) catalyze this reaction, but unselective combustion pathways limit alkene selectivities, especially at high conversions (418)."

[2] "The extent of dispersion and the local and extended structure of supported VOx species depend on the chemical identity and the surface area of the support (13, 17, 18)."

[3] "Polyvanadate species that form on ZrO2 at VOx surface densities above 34 VOx/nm2 provide active and selective sites for oxidative dehydrogenation reactions. Catalysts with lower VOx surface density and uncovered ZrO2 surfaces show lower alkene selectivities because of competing oxidation pathways leading to undesired CO and CO2 products."

[4] "Initial propene selectivities increase with increasing VOx surface density, as monovanadate species and exposed support sites, which favor primary combustion pathways, decrease in concentration."

[5] "Oxidative dehydrogenation rates per V-atom reach a maximum on VOx domains of intermediate size, which provide a balance between the activity of surface VOx species and their accessibility to reactants."

[6] "Interactions with supports determine the type of VOx structures present at a given surface density, but turnover rates do not depend on the identity of the support when differences in VOx structure are taken into account."

[1] "Zeolites are crystalline alumosilicates and as such are of no interest for redox reactions. Unlike other oxides, they have an intracrystalline system of micropores of molecular dimensions. Chemical composition of zeolites can be modified by transition metals due to their incorporation either into the crystal lattice or into the micropore space."

[2] "Modification with Fe is a special case. Unlike other metals, whose oxides initially exhibit some activity of the same sort as that after the introduction into the zeolite, iron atoms in ZSM-5 matrix acquire fundamentally new features compared to the free Fe2O3."

[3] "The iron loses its ability to activate O2, but acquires special affinity towards nitrous oxide, causing its decomposition in a particular way [53]. This reaction gives rise to the formation of a new form of surface oxygen (called a-oxygen [54]) which, as one can see further, is behind a unique performance of FeZSM-5 zeolites in the oxidation with N2O."

[4] "The study of parafn partial oxidation catalysts gave different observations [44]. In this case, to avoid overoxidation, the active sites (usually vanadium ions) must be isolated in the inert matrix of the support to prevent oxygen diffusion from the neighboring sites."

[5] "A detailed study of vanadium oxide supported on a variety of carriers [45] concluded that the presence of VOV fragments was essential for the selective oxidation."

[6] "Bulk oxides with the oxygen of low lability (MgO, ZnO, TiO2, etc.), or silica-supported oxides of V, Mo, W are usually used for this purpose."

[7] "The distribution of iron and other metals in zeolites has been studied extensively. In general, Fe can occupy three positions in ZSM-5 matrix [8487] and can exist as:
1. Isolated ions in tetrahedral positions of the crystal lattice;
2. Isolated ions or small complexes inside the intracrystalline micropore space;
3. Finely dispersed oxide phase on the outer surface of zeolite crystals."

[8] "Depending on Fe content and on the mode of catalyst activation, Ca can be regulated within several orders of magnitude, reaching up to nearly 100 mmol/g for the most active catalysts."

[9] "Experimentally, observed characteristics of a-oxygen can be explained by binuclear quantum chemical model of a-sites [92]."

[10] "According to recent quantum mechanical calculations [99], methane oxidation on FeZSM-5 proceeds with participation of binuclear complexes having Fe atoms bound by (m-oxo-) and (m-hydroxo-) bridges."

[11] "Recently, based on successful pilot plant operation, Solutia made an announcement of the jointly developed new process and shared its plans for fast-track commercialization [113]. Typical performance data from the Pensacola pilot plant are given in Table 7."

[1] "The zinc-exchanged (ZSM-5-Zn) and proton-exchanged (ZSM-5-H) forms of ZSM-5 zeolite have been studied for the conversion of propane to aromatic hydrocarbons at temperatures in the range 730-820 K."

[2] "ZSM-5-Zn was the more active and gave the better BTX selectivity (60-7OC%)."

[3] "The main features of the conversion mechanism are proposed involving propane dehydrogenation, followed by oligomerization and aromatization."

[4] "The primary dehydrogenation reaction is mechanistically different on the two types of catalyst: over ZSM-5-H dehydrogenation is rate controlled, while over ZSM-5-Zn this step is in quasi-equilibrium."

[5] "We suggest that this effect arises because the respective dehydrogenation steps are in quasi-equilibrium, with reaction 4 controlling the conversion and a dehydrogenation between aromatic and cyclic precursor controlling the BTX selectivity (both processes may well involve species of the type [Zn-H]+, c.f. reaction 4."

[6] "In the case of the ZSM-5-Zn catalyst, we suggest the zinc cation acts as a hydride acceptor to give a transient species such as [Zn-HI+ (and thence hydrogen)"

[7] "Over both ZSM-5-H and ZSM-5-Zn catalysts, ethane reactant was found to be much less reactive than propane: at 870 K the extent of ethane conversion was < 5%."

[8] "With both catalysts, as expected, the propane conversion fell with increasing space velocity but the product distributions behaved differently."

[9] "The apparent activation energies, obtained from Arrhenius plots of the propane conversions, were ZSM-5-Zn (I.28 wt% aluminium), 121+15 kJ mol-'; ZSM-5-Zn (0.71 wt% aluminium), 104+15 kJ mol-'; ZSM-5-H (1.28 wt% aluminium), 120t15 kJ mol-'."

[1] "Mo/HZSM-5 catalyst was prepared as described previously [1]. Mo-W/HZSM-5 was prepared by impregnating NH4ZSM-5 with aqueous solution of ammonium heptamolybdate and ammonium tungstate mixed from ttmgstic acid and aqueous ammonia."

[2] "The XRD, FT-IR and surface area results showed that Mo species are highly dispersed in the channels of the zeolite. The same seemed to occttr for MoW-ZSM-5 catalyst."

[3] "Pure methane can also be converted to aromatics over partially coked Mo/HZSM-5 and Mo-W/HZSM-5 catalysts at 873 K as can be seen in Table 2."

[4] "Results of the reaction of pure methane and natural gas (methane with some C2+ additive) over Mo/HZSM-5 catalyst are summarized in Table 2. It is shown that pure methane only can be converted to aromatics at 973 K [1]. However, the case is very different when we used natural gas as feed."

[5] "Natural gas, methane with C2+ additives at different methane purity, can even be converted to aromatics at the low temperature of 773 K and about 10-20% is obtained."

[6] "Conversion of methane to aromatics under non-oxidizing conditions can be initiated by higher hydrocarbon mixtures in the feed and, some special coke deposited on Mo/HZSM-5 catalyst at lower reaction temperature."

[1] "Additional evidence is presented for the role of gallium reduction in preparing active Ga/ZSM-5 catalysts for alkane aromatization."

[2] "Although reduction generates dispersed, active gallium species in zeolite channels, it is shown that for ethane dehydrogenation to aromatics the reduced (with hydrogen) Ga/ZSM-5 catalysts are not as active or selective as are materials which have been substantially reoxidized either by air or by traces of oxygen in inert gases."

[3] "Optimal catalysts for ethane aromatization are prepared by reduction with hydrogen to disperse the gallium, followed by reoxidation to a dispersed Ga3+ phase."

[4] "A substantially reduced catalyst (Ga+/Z- ca. 1) is both less active and selective for aromatics formation. Such catalysts also show lower hydrocracking activities than either unreduced or reoxidized materials, because of the reduction in Brønsted acidity associated with the transformation to Ga+Z- sites."

[5] "It is generally agreed that the primary role of extra-framework gallium in these materials is to enhance rates of alkene, diene, or cycloalkene dehydrogenation"

[6] "We propose that at the higher drying temperature used here (650 C) a small amount of Ga2O3 was reduced prior to the introduction of hydrogen, in agreement with the chemistry of bulk Ga2O3 at > 600 C"

[7] "The activity and aromatics selectivity for the series of Ga/HMFI catalysts generally followed the order B (reduced/oxidized) > C (reduced/He) > A (reduced) > D (reduced/oxidized/reduced)."

[8] "A combination of thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), and X-ray diffraction (XRD) studies has been used to confirm that rapid reoxidation takes place at 550C. However, the reoxidation does not regenerate β-Ga2O3, but rather a higher energy, dispersed Ga3+ which appears to be optimal for production of aromatics from ethane."

[9] "Reoxidized catalysts are stable under the reaction conditions used here (530-570°C, low hydrocarbon partial pressures), but are not stable to re-reduction by hydrogen at higher partial pressures."

[1] "Generally, zeolite protonic acidity is necessary for NO reduction: In contrast to H,Ga-ZSM-5, Na,Ga-ZSM-5 was inactive. The authors concluded that a synergism does exist between Ga species and H+ enabling the catalyst to activate the reductant (methane) for NO decomposition in the presence of O2."

[2] "Ga-modified ZSM-5 is far better than the Cu-modified version, which is even less active than unmodified ZSM-5. This indicates that the reaction can be accomplished to a considerable extent in the absence of any metal-related redox centers."

[3] "Framework gallium in an isolated tetrahedral environment cannot be reduced at moderate temperatures. The observed reducibility of gallium-modified zeolites therefore indicates the presence of nonframework gallium species."

[4] "Aromatization of liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) alkanes into aromatic components (mainly benzene, toluene, and xylenes, BTX) on Ga-modified ZSM-5 catalysts is commercialized in the Cyclar process jointly developed by UOP and BP."

[5] "Isomorphous substitution and replacement of exchangeable cations are important ways to modify zeolite properties for practical applications and have achieved considerable interest in the field of zeolite chemistry."

[6] "The chemical shift, δ, of a 29Si nucleus in a zeolite depends primarily on the number of T atoms in the first neighboring shell and on the TOT angles (T = tetrahedral species, Si, Al, Ga, Fe, Ge, etc.) of the bridging oxygen atoms that coordinate the 29Si nucleus."

[7] "Brnsted acidity within silicate-like materials is generated when tetravalent Si4+ is replaced with trivalent ions such as Al3+ or Ga3+."

[8] "Nonframework gallium is the source of Lewis acidity. Oxo cations GaO+ on exchange positions of the framework behave as Lewis acids."

[9] "Characteristically, IR vibration bands in both the hydroxyl region (wavenumbers beyond 3000 cm-1) and the framework region (wavenumbers below 1500 cm-1) are sensitive to the composition of the framework."

[1] "Ga and Zn species increase the rates of propane chemical conversion, recombinative hydrogen desorption, and deuterium incorporation from D2 into reaction products."

[2] "Disposal of hydrogen formed in C-H bond activation steps occurs by transfer of H-atoms to unsaturated species to form alkanes or to Ga and Zn species, which catalyze the recombinative desorption of H-atoms to form dihydrogen (H2)."

[3] "In-situ X-ray absorption studies suggest that Ga and Zn species reside at cation exchange sites as monomeric cations and that recombinative desorption involve reduction-oxidation cycles of such cations during each dehydrocyclodimerization turnover."

[4] "The addition of metal cations also increases the deuterium content in 'unreacted' propane (Fig. 18). The rate of incorporation of D-atoms into 'unreacted' propane provides an independent measure of the D-content in the surface pool"

[5] "Clearly, Ga and Zn species increase the reversibility of H-atom recombinative desorption steps and act as efficient 'portholes' for the removal of H-atoms produced during C-H bond activation steps."

[6] "The rate of propane dehydrocyclodimerization to form C6+ aromatics is limited by a sequence of irreversible dehydrogenation reactions leading to propene, higher alkenes, dienes, trienes, and aromatics."

[7] "Ga and Zn ions increase the rate of removal of alkenes from these oligomerization-cracking cycles. This removal must occur by the formation of products, such as aromatics (and H2) and alkanes, which are much less reactive than alkenes in acid-catalyzed reactions."

[1] "Zn-doped catalysts are well studied and one of them is used in the commercial Cyclar process."

          [2] "Zinc can be introduced to a zeolite by aqueous or solid ion exchange techniques. Action of the ZnCl2 vapour on H-ZSM5 also leads to a Zn-exchanged zeolite."

          [3] "The catalytic activity towards alkane aromatisation is due mainly to the ionic Zn2+ species."

          [4] "The first step of ethane and propane aromatisation in a Zn-doped zeolite catalyst is the dehydrogenation of these alkanes to the corresponding alkenes."

          [5] "The results obtained indicate that the reaction proceeds via a mechanism starting from the alkyl rupture of the ethane C–H bond (C2H5–•H–•), and the zinc cation acts as an acceptor of the alkyl group."

          [6] "The catalytic cycle for the alkyl activation consists of three elementary steps: (i) rupture of ethane C–H bond on the Zn–O–• pair; (ii) formation of ethene from the alkyl group bound to Zn; and (iii) formation of dihydrogen from the Brønsted proton and hydrogen bound to Zn."

          [7] "The selectivity of zeolite catalysts towards aromatisation of small alkanes can be greatly increased by incorporation of zinc or gallium ions."

[1] "Application of alternative oxidants in the form of various oxygen-containing molecules opens new possibilities. The idea of this approach is as follows. Variation of the oxidant chemistry should change the state of surface oxygen, while the activation of organic molecules may remain unchanged or affected to a smaller degree, thus providing new opportunity for controlling the selectivity."

[2] "In 1983, Iwamoto et al. [7] were the first to use N2O for the oxidation of benzene: [reaction equation] This reaction over a vanadia catalyst allowed achieving much better selectivity as compared to the oxidation by dioxygen. At 550 8C, the reaction selectivity exceeded 70%."

[3] "As for the nature of the catalytic activity, two different approaches were suggested. One of them is based on a traditional notion that zeolites are the acidic catalysts with strong Brønsted and Lewis sites. The other one relates to the common oxidation catalysis, which might be provided by the presence of a transition metal admixture."

[4] "Presently, one may conclude that the iron idea seems to be generally accepted, although the detailed structure and composition of α-sites till now are not perfectly clear and thus are the subject of many theoretical [54–60] and experimental [58,61–69] studies."

[5] "The reduced iron atoms of complex (III) appear to be inert to dioxygen. However, they are readily oxidized at elevated temperatures (over 200 8C) by nitrous oxide into complex (IV) to give adsorbed O a species. Namely, this reversible redox transition Fe2+ ↔ Fe3+ between complexes (III) and (IV) is considered to provide a selective transfer of oxygen atoms from N2O to hydrocarbon molecules to be oxidized."

[6] "Presently, many researchers are trying to use N2O for conducting various oxidation reactions by the catalytic way at elevated temperature. Quite good selectivities were achieved in the oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes [40,42,43] and in the epoxidation of propylene to propylene oxide [86]."

[7] "To suppress such side transformations and especially coking, leading to a heavy problem of the catalyst deactivation, the researchers are trying to neutralize various functional groups on the zeolite surface but leaving intact the α-sites. This is a difficult challenge."

[1] "High silica zeolites modified with gallium are known to be effective catalysts for promoting the dehydrogenation of light alkanes and subsequent aromatization of the thus produced alkenes."

[2] "The oxidized form of Ga/ZSM-5, where the main fraction of gallium ions is assumed to be present in the form of isolated gallyl ions, was found to be initially the most active for light alkane dehydrogenation."

[3] "We estimate formation of not more than three ethylene molecules per isolated GaO+ species before being reduced to Ga+. This, however, contradicts the recently reported observation of about 1000 catalytic cycles per oxidized gallium site in Ga/ZSM-5."

[4] "On the other hand, a low stability and, therefore, very high reactivity of the isolated gallyl ions may cause processes such as oligomerization of the isolated GaO+ species in the selectively oxidized Ga/ZSM-5 zeolite. In this case, a wide variety of different gallium oxide clusters can be generated."

[5] "The overall activation energy for ethane dehydrogenation over GaO+ sites in this case will not exceed 150 kJ mol-1. This value is about 25% lower than the one calculated for ethane dehydrogenation over the reduced Ga+ sites in ZSM-5 zeolite."

[6] "Although the initial alkyl activation of ethane is slightly more favorable as compared to the carbenium mechanism, subsequent chemical transformations of the reaction intermediates are easier in the latter case because of their lower stability."

[7] "The activation energies for the concerted C2H6 dehydrogenation paths are very close to those for the corresponding competitive elementary steps of the primary dehydrogenation route"

[1] "Aromatization of alkanes, which is well addressed in the literature,1h4 is an example of an economically important reaction. Ga and Zn zeolites have been used to promote this reaction and shown to exhibit a very high activity."

          [2] "The adsorption of methane on Zn-exchanged zeolites was studied theoretically by density functional theory (DFT). Diverse types of active sites were employed, such as: a Zn(II) cation, which was placed on dierent rings (4T and 5T), a ZnO (in a tetramer conguration) cluster and a [ZnOZn]2 dimer complex."

          [3] "Methane prefers to adsorb physically in a 3-fold conguration on Zn(II) at both 4T and 5T rings. This is not the case for ZnO and [ZnOZn]2 sites, in which the dissociative adsorption is more favorable."

          [4] "The [ZnOZn]2 site appears to be one of the active forms of the Zn cation on zeolites with a low Si/Al ratio. This site is more thermodynamically stable than both Zn(II) on 5T and (ZnO)4."

          [5] "Kazansky et al.9,12h14 have shown that both hydrogen and methane IR spectra demonstrated strong perturbation of their symmetric stretching vibration mode, when adsorbed on Zn-containing ZSM5."

          [6] "The dissociative adsorption of methane was also studied using the [ZnOZn]2 model. This dissociation is an exothermic reaction but not as exothermic as calculated for this reaction on (ZnO)4 clusters. Interestingly, the dissociation also follows the alkyl pathway, which forms the methyl carbanion."

[1] "It has been demonstrated that the nature and the dispersion of the metal oxide phase have a great inuence on the catalysts behavior."

          [2] "Likewise, Irusta et al. [16] demonstrated that the presence of vanadium oxide species with terminal oxygen sites (V=O) is needed for the oxidation to oxygenates whereas the presence of species without terminal V=O sites leads to the formation of complete oxidation products."

          [3] "Three different types of supported tungsten species are present in W/HZSM-5 catalysts: isolated tetrahedral W2^4 species probably grafted to the Bro^nsted acid sites of the zeolite, octahedral polymeric species such as polytungstates and WO3 crystallites."

          [4] "The relative amounts of these three types of species changes significantly with tungsten loading. At low contents of tungsten tetrahedral species predominates and they are mainly located in the channels of the zeolite. For higher loading the amount and the size of the polytungstate species increases gradually causing a decrease in the dispersion and the partial blocking up of the HZMS-5 zeolite."

          [5] "Formaldehyde selectivity seems to be related to the dispersion of the tungsten oxide phase, which, in turn, is influenced by the metal loading."

          [6] "It has been reported that both active oxygen ions and Bro^nsted acidic sites on HZSM-5 are active centers for methane activation"

          [7] "The active centers of the partial oxidation to formaldehyde over W/HZSM-5 are in the supported tungsten oxide phase."

          [8] "HZSM-5 zeolite shows higher activity in methane conversion but does not lead to formaldehyde production."

[1] "Acid ZSM-5 zeolites modified by gallium ions are known to be active catalysts for the aromatization of light paraffins [1]."

[2] "Modification of the hydrogen form by gallium was carried out by incipient wetness impregnation with an aqueous solution of Ga(NO3)3. The amount of modifying gallium ions was chosen to be 5 wt% corresponding to a Ga/Al atomic ratio of about unity."

[3] "After reduction in hydrogen at 773 K the intensity of the DRIFT band from acidic OH groups around 3610 cm−1 gradually decreased. This indicates substitution of the bridging hydroxyl groups by the modifying gallium ions."

[4] "Reduction of GaZSM-5 in hydrogen at 773 K and subsequent prolonged evacuation at 873 K did not show any infrared bands in the spectral range of 1900–2100 cm−1 associated with gallium hydrides [17]. These bands were also not observed after admission of hydrogen to the evacuated samples at room temperature. However, heating of such samples in a hydrogen atmosphere to 773 K with subsequent cooling of the zeolite in hydrogen to room temperature resulted in the appearance of two bands with maxima at 2041 and 2059 cm−1 (Fig. 5). We surmise that these bands relate to two different kinds of gallium hydrides."

[5] "When the gallium-modified samples were reduced in hydrogen at 773 K, we observed that the bands from carbon monoxide adsorbed by hydroxyl groups at 2120 and 2168 cm1 did not appear after CO exposure at room temperature (Fig. 9). This coheres with the complete substitution of acidic protons by reduced Ga+ ions"

[6] "Oxidative treatment of univalent gallium or gallium dihydrides with N2O results in their oxidation into singly positively charged oxo-ions"

[1] "Besides oxidative activation such as oxidative coupling of methane to C2+, non-oxidative activation of methane to produce aromatics over Mo/HZSM-5 catalysts in a continuous flow mode has attracted significant interest since 1993."

[2] "The catalysts and reaction conditions are presented. Emphasis has been focused on the modification of catalysts and optimization of reaction conditions."

[3] "The channel structure and acidity of HZSM-5 zeolite and the valence and location of Mo species are the crucial factors for the catalytic performance"

[4] "Generally speaking, the channel structure and acidity of the HZSM-5 and the valence and location of the Mo species on/in the zeolite are crucial factors for its catalytic performance."

[5] "The induction period of the reaction is commonly recognized, in which Mo6+ species possibly located on the external surface of the support are partially reduced or reduced to Mo2C, mainly yielding H2O, CO, CO2 and H2."

[6] "All the experiments showed that various pre-treatments and different reaction conditions, such as pre-treatment atmosphere [25,29,38] and temperature [28,36,40], reaction temperature [25,29], pressure [19,43], methane space velocity [24,25,28,43], and regeneration [25,36], exerted great influences on the catalytic performance."

[1] "We report here that a zirconium hydride complex, grafted onto the surface of silica, acquires such high electrophilic properties, that the reaction of o-bond metathesis between the Zr hydride and the C-H bonds of cyclooctane and methane becomes feasible."

          [2] "The silica surface enhances the electrophilicity of the zirconium centre, allowing the reaction of C-H activation of alkanes."

          [3] "This increase in the electrophilic character of the metal is probably related to the stabilization of an 8e-Zr by the surface siloxy ligands, while molecular analogues are usually stabilized by two cyclopentadienyl ligands and thus have a 16e-configuration."

          [4] "A common feature of these complexes is that the metal is in its highest oxidation state; it therefore, has a do electron configuration and is consequently highly electrophilic."

[1] "ZSM-5 zeolites modified with Cu+ ions were prepared either by the high-temperature chemical reaction of hydrogen form with CuCl vapour or by the wet ion exchange with subsequent reduction of the modified samples in CO at 873 K."

          [2] "Adsorption of H2, N2 or C2H6 by Cu+ ions was studied by DRIFTS and by volumetric technique. The conclusions about the structure of adsorption complexes were supported by the DFT cluster quantum chemical calculations."

          [3] "The DFT cluster modelling indicated that both adsorption of hydrogen and ethane could be explained by interaction with the isolated Cu+ ions localized at the a sites of the ZSM-5 framework."

          [4] "Quantum chemical calculations indicated the important role in the bonding of adsorbed hydrogen and ethane of electron back donation from dp-orbitals of Cu+ ions to the s*HH or CH orbitals."

          [5] "The copper modified ZSM-5 zeolits (CuZSM-5) are known to exhibit a high-catalytic activity in selective decomposition of NO into molecular oxygen and nitrogen"

          [6] "It was concluded that such unusual properties of adsorbed C2H6 molecules resulted from formation of a rather strong s-type adsorption complexes with the exchanged univalent copper cations."

          [7] "Adsorption of H2 by a part of Cu+ ions in CuZSM-5 results in a very strong perturbation of adsorbed molecules, which is evident from the very strong low-frequency shift of the corresponding HH stretching frequencies."

[1] "Gallium-containing ZSM-5 formulations are industrially preferred mainly due to the high volatility of zinc, and our discussion below describes the synthesis and catalytic function of these Ga-based formulations."

[2] "The aromatization of liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) alkanes to aromatics (mainly benzene, toluene, and xylenes, BTX) on Ga-modified ZSM-5 catalysts is commercialized in the Cyclar process jointly developed by UOP and BP."

[3] "Ga3 cations, in the as-prepared catalysts, irrespective of the preparation technique, are re-dispersed under the strongly reducing conditions and high temperatures prevalent during aromatization resulting in the active formulation of the catalyst."

[4] "Wet impregnation of HZSM-5 with gallium salt solutions (Gallium nitrate in general) guarantees gallium deposition on the catalyst, nevertheless, most of the gallium is found to be located on the outside of the zeolite crystals as evidenced by XPS and electron microscopy studies."

[5] "The gallium sites were considered to participate in alkane activation by dehydrogenation to form alkenes and hydrogenolysis to generate methane, adsorption/desorption of unsaturated compounds, dehydrogenation of olefinic compounds to give dienes and dehydrogenation of napthenic compounds to aromatics."

[6] "Based on setting the gallium parameters to be zero, the authors were also able to comment on the relative importance of gallium sites for various mechanisms. Gallium sites were calculated to result in the formation of 90% of the dienes and 50% of the aromatic molecules for propane aromatization."

[7] "The introduction of gallium was observed to increase the dehydrogenation rate constant by a factor of 7, while the protolytic cracking rate was not observed to be significantly altered."

[8] "Experimental data were generated at a hydrocarbon pressure of 1 bar, at a temperature of 803 K on a HZSM-5 material with Si/Al  27 for olefin aromatization (at 2-3 minutes on stream to avoid catalyst deactivation) and Si/Al  40 for propane aromatization. The gallium loading on these materials was 4 wt.%."

[1] "Supported vanadium oxides are particularly noteworthy because the active sites possibly involve isolated VO species (in contrast to the other systems based on MoOx or WOx)."

[2] "Both too low and too high surface V densities are detrimental to high selectivities, and this has been associated with the combustion of the thus-formed alkenes into COx on the support and/or the polymeric V species."

[3] "Overall, silica can be regarded as the optimal support in terms of selectivity. Another important fact is that the optimal temperature window for this process is quite narrow, and around 500 C, lower temperatures favor combustion while unselective gas phase reactions start to be competitive at higher temperatures (>550 C)."

[4] "Metal exchange zeolites (M-zeolites) have concentrated a large research effort, because of their ability to transform alkanes into alkenes and aromatics."

[5] "For instance, the Cyclar and related processes (aroforming or Z-forming) typically use Ga-zeolite to convert in a single step liquefied petroleum gas (LPG), composed of propane and butane, into H2 and liquid aromatics, i.e., benzene, toluene, and xylenes."

[6] "Ga-zeolites act as a multifunctional catalyst, and one of the key steps, the formation of alkenes from alkanes, takes place at Ga sites and involves a CH bond activation and formation of a Gaalkyl intermediate."

[7] "Zn-zeolites display a very similar reactivity pattern: H2 and alkane activation, H/D exchange, formation of aromatics from alkanes, and the coaromatization of methane and alkane."

[1] "γ -Al2O3-supported vanadium oxide catalysts (06.3 wt% V atoms) were prepared, characterized, and tested for the oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of both ethane and n-butane."

[2] "While the catalytic activity in the ODH reactions increases with the vanadium loading, the selectivity to the corresponding olefins shows a maximum for catalysts with 34 wt% V atoms."

[3] "Associated VO4 tetrahedra were observed by 51V-NMR on catalysts with V loading lower than 5 wt%, while VO6 octahedra were predominant on catalysts with higher V loading."

[4] "Although catalysts with octahedral V5+ species show higher catalytic activity, higher selectivity to oxydehydrogenation reactions was achieved on catalysts in which mainly tetrahedral V5+ species were observed."

[5] "The number and nature of the acid sites also change with the vanadium loading. Thus, Lewis acid sites were observed mainly on catalysts with low V loading, while both Lewis and Brnsted acid sites were observed on catalysts with high V loading."

[6] "Although V5+ species were observed mainly on calcined samples, V4+ species are observed on tested catalysts and their concentration depends on the alkane conversions used in the catalytic tests."

[7] "The reaction was studied in the temperature interval 450600C using an ethane/oxygen/helium molar ratio of 4/8/88."

[1] "We examine possible reaction mechanisms for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane by supported transition metal oxide catalysts. Specifically we are interested in V2O5 supported on SiO22,12,13 and consider monomeric OV(O)3 surface species, which together with dimeric and oligomeric V2O5 species are present on catalyst surfaces with low V2O5 loadings."

[2] "Hydrogen abstraction by the vanadyl oxygen atom is the initial step in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane by supported vanadium oxide species. The diradical intermediate that is reached via the diradicaloid transition structure Ts1 consists of a propyl radical attached to a HOV(O)3 site and has similar energies in the singlet and triplet states (Int2)."

[3] "For V2O5/SiO2 catalysts with vanadium surface coverages below 3 V/nm2 (i.e., below the limit at which V2O5 crystallites start to appear) turnover frequencies (TOF) of around 0.01 s-1 (748 K) 37 and 0.3 × 10-3 s-1 (623 K) 38 have been observed for propene formation."

[4] "Comparison with recent DFT calculations for V2O5(001) crystal surfaces9 indicates that vanadia sites may be significantly more active in the ODH of propane if they are part of the bulk surface and not supported as monomers on silica. However, apparent turnover frequencies may be lower for V2O5 crystallites on the surface because only a fraction of sites is accessible in three-dimensional particles."

[5] "The initial step is hydrogen abstraction from propane by the vanadyl oxygen atom leading to a diradical intermediate, namely, C3H7•·HOVIV(O)3."

[6] "We analyzed possible reaction mechanisms for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane by monomeric vanadium oxide species on silica."

[7] "Desorption of propyl radicals leads to a stationary concentration of propyl in the gas phase and leaves reduced HOVIV(O)3 sites on the surface. Due to fast reoxidation their concentration is much smaller than the concentration of OVV sites (Int0)."

[8] "We investigate possible mechanisms of oxidative dehydrogenation of propane using density functional theory. Monomeric vanadium oxide species supported on silica are modeled by vanadyl-substituted silsesquioxane."

[9] "The initial CH bond activation step is hydrogen abstraction by the vanadyl (OVV) group yielding a diradical intermediate in which a propyl radical is bound to a HOVIV site."

[10] "We predict that at 750 K the apparent activation energy is 123  5 kJ/mol and the rate constant is about 0.26 s-1, in close agreement with experiments."

[11] "The first hydrogen abstraction occurs exclusively on OVV sites, while the second hydrogen abstraction can also occur on VOSi bridging oxygen sites."

[1] "Several different compounds, particularly silica supported metal oxides [1,2] were used in the process. Recently it has been mentioned that ZSM-5 [3] and ZSM-5 combined with molybdenum [4,5] or tungsten [6] were investigated. Silica supported V2O5 and MoO3 were used most frequently. They are considered to be the most effective in the production of formaldehyde [7,8]."

[2] "Fe-ZSM-5 was used as a catalyst for the room temperature methane oxidation by N2O [1317]. The activation of methane over Fe-ZSM-5 is believed to be similar to methane activation in MMO thus to employ a redox mechanism."

[3] "The reaction was carried out at the atmospheric pressure at 350650 8C. ZSM-5 molecular sieves with the iron and silicon tetrahedral framework were used as catalysts. The Si/Fe molar ratio was 45, 34 and 22. Fe-ZSM-5 was applied both in the sodium and hydrogen form."

[4] "Higher values of methane conversion were acquired when Fe-HZSM-5 (31.51% for Si/Fe = 22) was used. Fe-NaZSM-5 resulted in procuring higher values of the selectivity of the oxidation of methane to methanol (74% for Si/Fe = 45)."

[5] "It was found that increasing the temperature as well as extending the contact time increases the conversion of methane to methanol and at the same time lowers the value of the selectivity of the oxidation of methane to methanol."

[6] "Increasing the iron content resulted in the rise of methane conversion. The selectivity of the oxidation of methane to oxygenates displayed a slight grow along with the drop of the iron content, while the selectivity of methane oxidation to carbon dioxide was falling."

"Zn-modified zeolites are effective catalysts for light alkanes aromatization [14]. The enhanced selectivity of alkane conversion (ethane [57] and propane [8,9]) towards aromatics is attributed to dehydrogenation ability of the loaded zinc species."

"It has been claimed [2,3] that strong Lewis sites, which are generated by zinc, change the mechanism of alkane activation and transformation from the beta scission to a dehydrogenation step."

"For Zn/H-BEA, the kinetic parameters of H/D exchange change dramatically. The rate constants kSiOHAl are at least two orders of magnitude higher. The activation energy of 86-88 kJ mol-1 is rather low. The exchange proceeds with a notable rate at temperatures at least 100 K lower compared to that on H-BEA."

"The promotion may consist of involvement of Zn-alkyl species in the exchange. They can be formed either on ZnO clusters or Zn2+ cations, located on neighbor or remote SiO()Al groups."

"Kazansky et al. [12–14] demonstrated the formation of strong adsorption complexes between small alkanes and Zn2+ cations by IR spectroscopy. They claimed that the activation of the alkane molecules in zeolite occurred on Zn2+ cations."

[1] "In general, in propane ODH catalysts made of Voxide supported on silica are more selective than those made with the alumina support, and the latter are more selective than those supported on titania, mainly because of the lower extent of parallel propane combustion, especially at low vanadia loading"

[2] "The reduction and catalytic properties of active VOx domains can be significantly affected by the formation of binary dispersed structures. For example, VOx-CrOx and VOx-MoOx mixed structures lead to a higher propane ODH rate and selectivity than VOx domains present at similar surface densities on pure Al2O3 supports"

[3] "The activation of the ethane CH bond proceeds through the formation of alkoxides, which decompose to ethylene and a surface OH group or are oxidized to surface-bound oxygenates (acetaldehyde)."

[4] "A key factor in the design of efficient catalysts for alkane ODH is the isolation of active sites. Therefore, the isomorphous substitution of active metal species, e.g., vanadium, into microporous and mesoporous materials is an attractive strategy for designing new catalysts for this reaction"

[5] "In the case of VCoAPO-18, the presence of both acid sites (related to the presence of Co2+ cations) and redox sites (related to the presence of V5+/4+ and Co3+/2+) seems to be an important factor in achieving high selectivities to ethylene during the ODH of ethane"

[6] "The catalytic activity of vanadium oxide catalysts increases with the V2O5 loading, while rates per V-atom reach a maximum on VOx domains of intermediate size, providing a balance between the activity of surface VOx species and their accessibility to reactants."

[7] "For both propane and ethane, reactivity data for catalysts made of supported vanadium oxide are consistent both with kinetically relevant steps involving the dissociation of CH bonds (methylenic C atom in propane) and with a Mars-van Krevelen redox mechanism involving lattice oxygen in CH bond activation."

[8] "One of the best performing catalysts in propane ODH is the VOx-SBA-15 system, prepared by an alcoholic impregnation method, in which the introduction of V species onto the inner walls of SBA-15 provides a system with a large concentration of accessible, isolated and structurally well-defined active sites."

[9] "The selectivity to propylene formation is affected by surface reduction: the higher the surface reduction, the higher the selectivity"

[10] "Additives (e.g., P, K, Ca, Ni, Cr, Nb, Mg, Au, Zn and Mo), sometimes added in relevant amount with respect to V, modify acidbasic and redox properties of supported vanadium oxide"

[11] "Examples include V-containing high-surface siliceous materials, such as MCM-41, MCM-48 or SBA-15. In these systems, the catalytic activity of vanadium is strongly influenced by its local environment and the co-existence of acid sites in the host material."

[1] "All catalysts used industrially for the production of maleic anhydride from butane are PVO-based systems."

[2] "The vanadyl pyrophosphate catalyst, due to its particular crystalline structure, shows a singular ability to control its oxidizing power."

[3] "The best selectivity is achieved when desorption of less selective intermediates along the reaction coordinate is avoided because the olefin reactions are less selective on a highly active butane (VO)2P2O7 catalyst."

[4] "The availability of oxygen to the surface is critical in avoiding desorption of less selective olefins. Thus it would appear that major selectivity gains could be achieved if more oxygen could be channeled to the active site."

[5] "A central role in the modification of surface reactivity is adsorption of organic molecules and oxygen species. The mobility of these species under steady-state conditions of reaction is another characteristic of the vanadyl pyrophosphate catalyst in n-butane oxidation"

[6] "The vanadium phosphorus oxide system is characterized by facile formation and interconversion of a number of crystalline V(IV) and V(V) phases, and this has led to some confusion in the literature as to the nature of the active phase."

[7] "Kinetics data agree that the hydrocarbon activation is the first step in n-butane oxidation."

[8] "The TAP results suggest that the selectivity of the butane oxidation reaction is influenced by the concentration of these species at the initial butane adsorption site."

[9] "Activation of the alkane hydrocarbon is a further important aspect of this reaction because of its mechanistic relevance in the study of other heterogeneous reactions for functionalization of alkanes"

[10] "A very specific surface structure is needed, and it would seem that the binding of intermediates until product is formed (single-site process) is essential to high selectivities."

[11] "For example, the use of an organic solvent during preparation as opposed to an aqueous system results in differing degrees of crystallinity and defect structure of the resulting active phase."

[1] "Zn- or Ga-modified zeolites effectively catalyze the conversion of light alkanes to aromatics with high selectivity."

[2] "The role of the metal species and acid sites of a zeolite in the enhancement of light alkane conversion to aromatics remains a subject of intense controversy, even after significant emphasis and numerous publications."

[3] "There is agreement on the bifunctional nature of these catalysts, where the metal species are responsible for the dehydrogenation of alkanes, while the Brnsted acid sites are involved in the oligomerization and cyclization of olefins."

[4] "When zeolites are modified with Zn, the picture of hydrogen exchange changes. Regioselectivity of the exchange is observed on Zn/H-ZSM-5 and Zn/H-BEA for propane and n-butane."

[5] "A significant increase in the reaction rates with lowering apparent activation energies demonstrate the promoting effect of Zn on the reaction of H/D hydrogen exchange for C1n-C4 alkanes."

[6] "The acceleration of H/D exchange, coupled with the decreased activation energy for Zn-modified zeolites, demonstrates that the CH bonds in alkanes break and form more easily and reversibly with intermediate involvement of Zn species."

[7] "The strong influence of Zn on the activation of CH bonds of small alkanes by the zeolite Brnsted sites is achieved by involvement in the exchange of Znalkyl species, whose formation from alkanes precedes its further involvement in interaction with Brnsted acid sites."

[1] "The dehydroaromatization of methane to benzene has been investigated over a 2 wt% Mo/ZSM-5 catalyst in the absence of an added oxidant."

[2] "Under typical CH4 reaction conditions at 700C, 60–80% of the original Mo6+ ions are reduced to form Mo2C, with the remaining Mo occurring primarily as Mo4+ and traces of Mo5+ ions."

[3] "Exposure of a 2 wt% Mo/ZSM-5 catalyst to CH4 or to CH4/H2 at 700C causes reduction of Mo ions to Mo2C, rather than to metallic Mo."

[4] "Since preformation of Mo2C on the catalyst, without coke deposition, does not completely eliminate the induction period, it is believed that the clean surface of Mo2C may be too reactive to form higher hydrocarbons and, thus, that a coke-modified Mo2C surface may be the actual active species in the formation of ethylene as the reaction intermediate."

[5] "The presence of a certain concentration of acid sites in Mo/ZSM-5 catalysts is thus necessary to achieve a high benzene selectivity and a high methane conversion, since the formation of aromatics is thermodynamically favored"

[6] "During preparation and/or pretreatment of the catalyst, a portion of the Mo ions diffuses into the channels of the zeolite. The amount of Mo ions within the channels depends on the temperature, time, and atmosphere of calcination."

[7] "It appears that the dispersion of molybdenum oxide species on the surface of ZSM-5 may occur slowly and/or may be restricted to a short distance."

[3] "Binuclear sites are argued to account for the enhanced activity of oxygenated gallium-exchanged high-silica zeolites in alkane dehydrogenation."

[4] "These sites, however, tend to decompose via water desorption upon the catalytic reaction resulting in less reactive reduced Ga+ ions."

[5] "As per predictions from the quantum-chemical calculations, the experimental results show that the high alkane dehydrogenation activity can be maintained by in situ hydrolysis of the reduced extraframework Ga species."

[6] "Clearly, co-feeding of water leads to a substantial increase of the propane conversion. The conversion passes a maximum at pH2O of 0.3 kPa."

[7] "The promoting effect of water is due to the formation of reactive partly hydrolyzed gallium species such as [HGaOGaOH]2+ and [HGa(OH)2GaH]2+ discussed above."

[8] "Addition of water to the hydrocarbon feed increases significantly the dehydrogenation activity. The main product remains propylene although with increasing water content, formation of the products of propane cracking (methane and ethylene) is observed."

[9] "Formation of less stable intermediate products in the catalytic cycle facilitates the regeneration of the active site. Indeed, moderate barriers are calculated for H2 recombination in the catalytic cycle involving [HGa(OH)(O)Ga]2+ species."

[10] "Although earlier isolated mononuclear GaO+ have been proposed as the active sites in Ga-containing high-silica zeolites, the present results indicate that such species should oligomerize in the microporous space, independent of the Al distribution."

[1] "Supported vanadium oxide catalysts, containing surface vanadia species on oxide supports, are extensively employed as catalysts for many hydrocarbon oxidation reactions."

[2] "The molecular structures of these surface vanadia species are tentatively thought to consist of a terminal V=O bond and three bridging V-O-support bonds for the isolated species, and a terminal V=O bond with one bridging V-O-support and two bridging V-O-V bonds for the polymerized species."

[3] "The bridging V-O-support bond appears to be associated with the critical oxygen required for hydrocarbon oxidation reactions since changing the specific oxide support dramatically affects the TOF: approximately four orders of magnitude for methanol oxidation to formaldehyde and two-orders of magnitude for butane oxidation to maleic anhydride."

[4] "The general trend appears to be CeOz>ZrO2 TiO2>NbzOs>A12Os>SiO2, which inversely correlates with the Sanderson electronegativity of the oxide support cations."

[5] "As a result of these physical and chemical characteristics, supported vanadia catalysts tend to be among the most active and selective supported metal oxide catalysts for hydrocarbon oxidation reactions."

[6] "The oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propylene over V2O5/Nb2O5 was not dependent on the concentration of the bridging V-O-V bonds"

[7] "Oxidation reactions requiring only one surface vanadia sites are generally not sensitive to the surface vanadia coverage and the presence of noninteracting metal oxide additives. Oxidation reactions requiring multiple surface vanadia sites are very sensitive to surface vanadia coverage and the presence of noninteracting metal oxide additives."

[8] "The addition of surface niobia is especially informative since it has a minimal effect on the surface vanadia structure, see Section 5.6 above, and its presence primarily increases the number of adjacent surface metal oxide sites for the surface vanadia species."

[9] "Interacting additives affect all hydrocarbon oxidation reactions since they directly alter the structure and reactivity of the surface vanadia sites."

[10] "Acidic and basic additives also influence the selectivity of hydrocarbon oxidation reactions, but the effect appears to be reaction specific and cannot be generalized with the limited data currently available."

[1] "Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts are most active and selective for the aromatisation of propane [1]. It is widely accepted that their activity and selectivity result from their bifunctional properties, whereby gallium species are responsible for their dehydrogenation-hydrogenation activity and the Brönsted acid sites of the zeolite provide the centres necessary for chain growth."

[2] "Recently, it was shown that dual active sites are responsible for the activation of propane on Ga/H-ZSM-5 [2-4]. These dual active sites consist of highly dispersed (Ga3+, O2-) ions pairs, acting in synergy with neighbouring Brönsted sites which initially activate propane as a protonated pseudo-cyclopropane species."

[3] "Changes in the propane aromatisation activity and selectivity of these catalysts as a function of the number of reaction (reducing conditions)-regeneration (oxidative conditions) cycles sustained were explained by the migration of gallium species in and out of the zeolite intracrystalline void space [5] as substantiated by detailed catalyst characterisation [6]."

[4] "Hydrogen treatment increases activity and selectivity to aromatics while decreasing the formation of methane. Subsequent oxygen treatment enhances further the activity and aromatics selectivity and has little effect on methane selectivity."

[5] "These improvements of catalytic performance are explained by gallium migration in reducing conditions. The concentration of highly dispersed gallium species is thereby enhanced. These species, in association with Brønsted centers, were reported previously to constitute the dual catalytic sites responsible for alkane activation."

[6] "Several authors have also reported the inhibitory effect of hydrogen on propane transformation over Zn/H-ZSM-5 [24] and Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts [25]. A possible explanation is that the limiting step of the propane dehydrogenation is the removal of hydrogen [26]."

[7] "H2-O2 pretreatment thus appear to be a promising way to preactivate and stabilise Ga-modified aromatisation catalysts in commercial operation."

[1] "This review paper presents the significant advances which were made in the last decade in the understanding of the transformation over acid and bifunctional zeolite catalysts of the cheap and readily available C2C4 alkanes into more valuable products: mechanism of activation, reaction scheme, nature of the active sites."

[1] "Previous studies have shown that supported vanadia is the most active and selective simple metal oxide for alkane ODH, because its reducible nature leads to the rapid redox cycles required for a catalytic turnover (15)."

[2] "UVvisible spectroscopy suggests that V5+ is present in distorted tetrahedrally coordinated species at low vanadia surface densities and that some of these tetrahedrally coordinated cations remain at higher surface densities, coexisting with an increasing fraction of V5+ present in distorted tetragonal pyramidal coordination, similar to that present in V2O5 (25)."

[3] "For both ethane and propane reactants, these apparent turnover rates reach a maximum at intermediate vanadia surface densities. The maximum rate is reached at a surface VOx density of 8 V/nm2 for both reactants, and this maximum rate is about four times greater than that obtained on the VOx/Al2O3 sample with the lowest surface density (1.4 V/nm2)."

[4] "Ethane ODH at zero conversion is 75% selective to ethene and insensitive to vanadia surface density, while initial propene selectivities during propane ODH approach 90% at low vanadia surface densities, but decrease with increasing vanadia surface density."

[5] "Therefore, the highest olefin yields are obtained on catalysts containing isolated monovanadates and operated at the highest possible reaction temperature consistent with the avoidance of homogeneous reactions."

[6] "VOx/Al2O3 catalysts were prepared by incipient wetness impregnation of fumed γ-alumina (Degussa, AG, 100 m2/g) with an aqueous solution of ammonium metavanadate (99%, Aldrich, Inc.) and oxalic acid (Mallinckrodt analytical grade) in a 1 : 2 weight ratio (12) with a pH of 2."

[7] "Reaction rate and selectivity data were measured in a packed-bed flow reactor with plug-flow hydrodynamics (24). VOx/Al2O3 catalysts (0.010.3 g) were diluted with quartz granules (180- to 355-m diameter, 0.010.3 g) in order to prevent bed temperature gradients."

[8] "Ethane ODH reactions were examined at 663743 K, while the faster propane ODH reactions were examined at lower temperatures (603663 K)."

[1] "Isolated molybdate species supported on silica are reported to have the highest specific activity and selectivity for the direct oxidation of methane to formaldehyde."

[2] "On the basis of evidence from extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) and Raman spectroscopy, the Mo atoms in this catalyst are present as isolated, pentacoordinated molybdate species containing a single MoO bond."

[3] "It is proposed that peroxides are produced by the reaction of O2 with a small concentration of reduced molybdate species and that the reaction of CH4 with these peroxide species leads to the formation of formaldehyde."

[4] "Low concentrations of H2O were observed to enhance the activity of MoOx/SiO2 for CH4 oxidation to formaldehyde."

[5] "During CH4 oxidation to formaldehyde, the catalyst undergoes only a very small degree of reduction and typically only 50500 ppm of MoVI is reduced to MoIV."

[6] "It was established that treatment of MoOx/SiO2 at 873 K under pure methane reduces the dispersed molybdate species to only a limited extent and results mainly in the deposition of amorphous carbon."

[1] "Catalytic reactions of hydrocarbons in zeolites can be profoundly affected by extraframework transition-metal cationic clusters. MFI zeolites containing dehydrogenating species such as gallium, zinc, and platinum form the basis for light alkane aromatization (Cyclar, Aroforming, Z-forming) processes."

[2] "The water-induced enhancement in the rate of alkane activation by Ga/ZSM-5, as discussed herein, relates to transformation of these single Ga+ centers to binuclear cationic Ga complexes involving a Ga2O22+ core."

[3] "Clearly, cofeeding of water leads to a substantial increase of the propane conversion. The conversion passes a maximum at p of 0.3kPa. Catalyst performance in the presence of steam (0.3kPa) was found to be stable over a period of at least 4h."

[4] "Addition of water to the feed strongly increases the activity. The main product remains propylene, although with increasing water content slightly increased amounts of methane and ethylene are formed."

[5] "The promoting effect of water is due to the formation of reactive partly hydrolyzed gallium species. For mononuclear gallium sites, the catalytic cycle is initiated by desorption of H2 from [Ga3+(H)(OH)]+ to form the GaO+ ion."

[6] "Dehydrogenation of an alkane over the Ga2O2 dimer proceeds by initial heterolytic dissociation by the Lewis acid pair formed by Ga3+ and the basic extraframework oxygen atom (Scheme1) with subsequent olefin desorption and hydrogen recombination."

[7] "In summary, addition of water to reduced Ga cations stabilizes binuclear hydroxyl-bridged Ga-containing cationic reaction intermediates. The increased acidity of the bridging hydroxyl bond and the stable tetrahedral configuration around Ga3+ ions facilitate H2 desorption."

[1] "The oxidation of n-butane to maleic anhydride is the only industrial process of selective oxidation of a paraffin."

[2] "Fixed-bed: mving-bed:- and fluidized-bed reactors all use the same type of catalyst, (VO)2P207, and no other catalytic composition has been successfully proposed."

[3] "The catalytic behavior of the V-P-based catalysts depends on the following main factors: Method of preparation of the precursor (type of reagents, reducing agents, and solvent; temperature, and dry or wet milling); P/V ratio; Presence of additives; and Methodology of activation and conditioning of the precursor at high temperature."

[4] "Catalysts with a slight excess of phosphorus (P/V=1.05) exhibit the right compromise between reducibility and reoxidizability necessary to obtain both high activity and high selectivity."

[5] "By means of XPS analysis, many inestigators, with the exception of Okuhara et al., have found a higher P/V ratio (in the range 1.5 to 3) on the surface than in the bulk."

[6] "There is a general agreement that a high P/V ratio helps in avoiding the oxidation of V4+ in (VO)2P2O7."

[7] "Since 1974 n-butane has been increasingly used in place of benzene as the raw material for maleic anhydride production for the following reasons: Lower price, High availability in many regions, and Nontoxicity."

[1] "Two Mo/HZSM-5 catalyst series have been tested in the partial oxidation of methane to formaldehyde at atmospheric pressure."

[2] "Two different molybdenum species were detected in these catalysts: tetrahedral monomeric Mo(VI) species and octahedral coordinated polymolybdate species."

[3] "For molybdenum loading higher than 1.3 wt.%, polymolybdate species are predominant causing a decrease in the dispersion and a partial blocking up of the HZSM-5 zeolite channels."

[4] "Both catalyst series show different activity in methane conversion. Polymolybdate species of impregnated Mo/HZSM-5 catalysts are more reactive in methane activation than acid sites of HZSM-5 but lead to low HCOH selectivity values."

[5] "In contrast, treated catalysts show lower methane conversion but higher HCOH selectivity. These results demonstrate the specificity of the Mo=O sites of monomeric species for HCOH production."

[6] "It seems to be a general agreement in the catalytic role of each active site in the methane partial oxidation [6,911]. Thus, Mo=O sites of terminal atoms in molybdenum oxide crystallites or isolated monomeric species seem to be specific sites for HCOH production, while MoOMo sites of polymolybdate species and MoO3 cluster would lead to the total oxidation products."

[7] "A well-dispersed molybdenum oxide phase mainly constituted of tetrahedral monomeric species joined to the zeolite surface was characterized."

[1] "The best results were obtained for a simple reaction, the oxidation of benzene to phenol over Fe-containing ZSM-5 zeolites. It proceeds with nearly 100% selectivity at 25-30% benzene conversion."

[2] "Supported oxides of vanadium, molybdenum and tungsten demonstrated the best results. At 550°C in the presence of 30% water vapor in the gas flow, the vanadia catalyst provided a 71.5% selectivity towards phenol at 10.6% benzene conversion."

[3] "Results obtained over zeolites were rather unexpected. Table 2 shows catalytic properties of some zeolites tested under conditions similar to those for vanadia catalysts. A considerable amount of phenol was obtained in several cases. Especially interesting results were observed over AlPO4 and ZSM-5 zeolites."

[4] "ZSM-5 zeolites to be promising catalytic systems for benzene oxidation to phenol by dinitrogen monoxide. These catalysts allowed the reaction to proceed within a 300-400°C temperature range without water addition into the reaction mixture. Moreover, they provided a very high selectivity towards phenol."

[5] "Fig. 4 shows benzene conversion as a function of iron content in Fe-Al-Si samples plotted with the data of ref. 57. In fact, the samples Fe(Al)-0.004 and Fe(Al)-0.007 containing an extremely small amount of Fe (0.004 and 0.007 wt.-%, correspondingly) exhibit a very low activity. As iron content grows up to ca. 0.1 wt.-% of Fe2O3, benzene conversion increases considerably and then reaches a plateau with minor subsequent changes."

[6] "Properties of α-oxygen were studied in a number of papers [31,32,60-64] and were shown to be as follows:
1. It is formed on Fe-ZSM-5 zeolites and not on Fe2O3 or other iron-containing catalysts tested.
2. It is loosely bonded to the surface, the value of the bond energy being anomalously low.
3. It is thermally stable up to 300°C; above this point it desorbs irreversibly into the gas phase.
4. It is produced upon dinitrogen monoxide decomposition but not upon oxygen adsorption.
5. It exhibits high reactivity: at room temperature it is involved in oxygen isotopic exchange as well as in oxidation of carbon monoxide and methane."

[7] "Referring to ref. 59, the ability to produce the α-form of the surface oxygen is the main specific peculiarity of dinitrogen monoxide as an oxidant."

[1] "The catalytic dehydrocondensation of methane to benzene and naphthalene with a bulky of hydrogen on transition metal supported zeolite catalysts is one of strategies for the catalytic conversion of methane and a challenging topic in heterogeneous catalysis."

[2] "Wang et al. [11] reported that methane could be transformed to benzene in a flow mode reactor on transition metal ions supported HZSM-5 catalysts under non-oxidative condition."

[3] "It is generally accepted that the Mo/HZSM-5 is one of the good catalysts as reported by groups of Xu and co-workers [13,14], Chen et al. [15], Solymosi et al. [1619], Wang et al. [20,21], and Liu et al. [22,23]."

[4] "Weckhuysen et al. [26] studied the effect of transition metal ions, the preparation and treatment method. They found that the activity is in the following sequence: Mo > W > Fe > V > Cr."

[5] "Zhang et al. studied the methane aromatization over Mo-based catalysts supported on different types of zeolites [32]. It was found that H-type silicaalumina zeolites, such as ZSM-5, ZSM-8, ZSM-11 and β-zeolite, were effective supports for Mo-based catalysts"

[6] "During the past 8 years, the catalyst modification in term of zeolite micropores was extensively studied [23,3237]. Some of typical results are listed in Table 1."

[1] "Coaromatization of methane and light hydrocarbons (paraffins and olefins) at 700800K is one of the alternative methods for the conversion of methane."

[2] "It has been reported recently that the conversion of methane during coaromatization with higher alkanes or alkenes (C2C6) at 670870K in the presence of bifunctional catalysts (mainly, high-silica ZSM-5 or ZSM-11 zeolites, modified with gallium or zinc) may reach 2040%."

[3] "Our data show that the activation of methane on Zn/H-BEA indeed occurs at 523K through the formation of a surface methoxy species (a stabilized methyl cation) (δ=58ppm8 in the 13C CP/MAS NMR spectrum, Figure3a). The initial activation of methane also gives a Zn-CH3 species (δ=21ppm9)."

[4] "The dissociation of methane on ZnO species may be facilitated by neighboring acidic sites of the zeolite."

[5] "The role of the higher hydrocarbon consists of producing aromatic compounds, which further serve as a trap for the methoxy species formed from methane on the Zn sites (Scheme1a)."

[6] "Thus, the main pathway for the conversion of methane into aromatic compounds during the course of the methane and propane co-conversion represents the alkylation of propane-originating aromatic molecules by 13CH4."

[1] "Depending on the vanadium loadings, different vanadium oxide species (V5+) were formed on the surface of alumina after calcination. Mainly isolated and polymerized VO4 units were observed at coverages up to a monolayer [1,5,13] while VO6 octahedra were predominant on catalyst surfaces at higher vanadium loadings [1]."

[2] "The molecular structure of the surface vanadium oxide species and the catalytic properties are influenced by the method of preparation, the nature of support, promotors and environmental conditions [1]."

[3] "It is suggested that both isolated and polymerized tetrahedrally coordinated V5+ species are active in propane dehydrogenation. The AlVO4 phase and bulk-like V2O5 have only a low catalytic activity."

[4] "The highest propene selectivity was obtained for the sample with the highest dispersion of the isolated and polymerized tetrahedrally coordinated V5+ species."

[5] "Propene selectivity depends on the dispersion of the tetrahedrally coordinated V5+ species; the higher the dispersion, the higher the propene selectivity. CO is the main product of propene oxidation and its formation increases with decreasing dispersion of active sites."

[6] "Vanadium species formed on the alumina support after calcination between 773 and 973 K at vanadium loadings between 4.45 and 13.2 wt.% were characterized with different methods (51V NMR, ESR, H2-TPR and in situ UVvis-DRS) and tested in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane."

[7] "By calcination at 873 K, beside dispersed isolated and polymerized V5+ surface species mainly in tetrahedral coordination, a crystalline AlVO4 phase was formed. The portion of vanadium present as AlVO4 increases with increasing vanadium loadings (e.g. about 60 at 13.2 wt.%)."

[8] "Initial propane reaction rate (Table 5) has the highest values for the samples V(8.9/773), V(4.5/873) and V(8.9/873). In these samples, dispersed isolated and polymerized tetrahedrally coordinated V5+ species dominate."

[1] "Copper-exchanged ZSM-5 zeolite (CuZSM-5) is known to exhibit a high catalytic activity in the selective decomposition of NO into molecular oxygen and nitrogen."

[2] "The copper adsorption centers could be formed both in an indirect way after reduction of dimeric oxygen-bridged [CuOCu]21 species or directly by high-temperature reaction of the hydrogen form with the CuCl vapour at elevated temperature."

[3] "As a possible site for Cu1 localization the six-membered ring composed of two five-membered rings on the walls of the straight channels of the ZSM-5 zeolite (the a-site) was chosen."

[4] "Adsorption of C2H6 can take place at the Cu1Z site both in Z1 and Z2 geometries."

[5] "The bonding in such [Cu1(Z2-C2H6)]Z complexes could be rationalized by a synergetic combination of ligand-to-metal electron donation from CH s-orbitals to the partially-occupied Cu1 s-orbital combined with metal-to-ligand back-donation from the copper dp-orbitals to CH s* orbitals."

[1] "Unpromoted HZSM-5 is, however, a poor dehydrogenation catalyst; addition of promoters is required for such application."

[2] "Modification of the zeolite with zinc or gallium has been successful for this purpose."

[3] "For the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane and n-butane, it has been reported that the alkene yield is highest over Fe3+ silicalite, and rapid cracking and combustion of propane occurred over ion-exchanged Fe/ZSM-5 and FeOx/silicalite."

[4] "Upon condensation of the vapor of a volatile precursor on the H-form of the zeolite, the concentration of Brnsted sites is lowered drastically and a high level of ion exchange is obtained. Subsequent treatment with H2O to remove chlorine from the precursor induces hydrolysis of the metal ions."

[5] "Hydrolysis converts naked ions into oxo ions, such as (GaO)+ and (HOFeOFeOH)2+. They are identified by temperature-programmed reduction with H2 and CO and, in the case of the binuclear Fe3+ ion, by ESR spectroscopy."

[6] "The Ga2O3 clusters are easily reduced to Ga+ at 450 C. With (HOFeOFeOH)2+ in cationic exchange positions reduction is reversible at 500 C."

[7] "In the case of Zn/ZSM-5, isolated Zn2+ cations compensate the charge of two Al-centered tetrahedra or attach themselves to one silanol group or ZnOH and one Al-centered tetrahedron. In this state, the Zn ions are stabilized and cannot be reduced below 800 C."

[8] "When Ga, Zn, and Fe replace protons in HZSM-5, they form strong Lewis acid sites."

[1] "Iron complexes in the ZSM-5 zeolite matrix (α-centers) are shown to perform single-turnover cycles of methane oxidation to methanol at room temperature when nitrous oxide is used as a source of oxygen."

[2] "FeZSM-5 zeolite containing iron complexes that form under thermal activation (called α-centers [7]) is able to perform single-turnover cycles of selective methane oxidation to methanol at room temperature when nitrous oxide (N2O) is the source of oxygen."

[3] "At temperatures lower than 573 K, N2O decomposition on α-centers quantitatively follows reaction (1): N2O + ( )α = (O)α + N2, loading the active centers with α-oxygen [7]."

[4] "There are α-centers whose activity gives FeZSM-5 zeolites a unique ability to catalyze direct oxidation of benzene to phenol with nitrous oxide at 573-623 K, providing nearly 100 % selectivity [9,14]."

[5] "Binuclear iron centers are a particular feature of MMO compared to the mononuclear centers of other monooxygenases [1]. There is some indirect evidence favoring the binuclear structure of the active iron complexes in the ZSM-5 matrix"

[1] "We report here the preparation of a new catalyst for the partial oxidation of methane by grafting of MoO2(acac)2 (acac: acetylacetonate ligand) onto the surface of acidic HZSM-5 zeolite."

[2] "It was shown by FT-IR spectroscopy that the reaction takes place between the acidic hydroxyl groups of the zeolite and the acetylacetonate ligands of the complex."

[3] "As a consequence of this reaction, and by avoiding the presence of water, isolated oxo species of molybdenum in oxidation state VI were obtained with a large dispersion."

[4] "On account of the specific activity of these isolated MoO42species, the new grafted Mo/HZSM-5 catalyst greatly improves the formaldehyde yield in the methane partial oxidation reaction with respect to those of the classical impregnated W and Mo/HZSM-5 catalysts."

[5] "Grafting of transition metal complexes onto reactive surface structures is an expeditious alternative method to obtain catalytic systems with definable structure and composition"

[6] "The authors have reported the partial oxidation of methane to formaldehyde over W and Mo/HZSM-5 catalysts prepared by conventional aqueous impregnation [13,14]. It was shown that three different types of metal oxide species are present in these catalysts, the relative amount of each one varying with the metal loading: tetrahedral monomeric species, octahedral polymeric species and metal oxide crystallites."

[7] "The weakness of the CH bond of methane, caused by distortion of the methane molecule through its interaction with the zeolite surface, has been proposed as the first step in the methane activation mechanism [10]."

[8] "Formaldehyde selectivity was dependent on the dispersion and the nature of metal oxide supported phase."

[9] "Several authors have reported the specificity of M=O and MOM sites (M: Mo, V) in the production of HCOH and carbon oxides, respectively, from methane over MoO3 and V2O5 silica-supported catalysts [32,33,3638]."

[1] "ZnMFI catalyzes dehydrogenation and aromatization of light paraffins, etc."

[2] "Unlike ion exchange or incipient wetness impregnation, the reaction of hydrogen forms of MFI with zinc vapour at 773 K results in the practically complete substitution of protons by zinc ions."

[3] "The catalytic properties of high-silica zeolites modified with bivalent cations are quite different from those of faujasites containing the same cations."

[4] "Zinc or other bivalent ions with only partially compensated positive charges exhibit an unusually high chemical activity. This explains the specific catalytic and adsorption properties of high-silica zeolites modified with the bivalent transition metal cations."

[5] "Our recent results also demonstrated that MFI modified with bivalent Zn or Co cations possess unusual adsorption properties. For instance, low-frequency shifts of HH stretching vibrations of molecular hydrogen adsorbed by these ions at 77 K exceed 200 cm1."

[6] "Application of low temperature H2 adsorption as a molecular probe indicated that similar sites of unusual localization of bivalent zinc cations also exist in zeolites modified by ion exchange or incipient wetness impregnation, but the amount of such sites is less than for the samples modified by reaction with zinc vapour."

[7] "Complete substitution of protons indicates that at high Si/Al ratios some of the Zn2 cations are localized at the isolated aluminium occupied oxygen tetrahedra with single negative charges. This results in the formation of sites with only partially compensated excessive positive charges of bivalent cations."

[1] "The oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of propane over a supported vanadia catalyst is of great interest because of its importance in industrial catalysis."

[2] "Experimental studies of catalyst structure (25) generally agree that when the concentration of vanadium oxide species is low, isolated VO4 units form on the support surface. These units are assumed to contain a vertical VO double bond and three bridging VOS linkages, where S represents the support metal cation (S = Al, Si, Ti, etc.)."

[3] "The dependence of the reactivity on coverage of the support surface by vanadium oxide is unclear in the literature."

[4] "Experimental studies of the ODH reaction with supported vanadia catalysts have generally supported the reaction mechanism originally proposed by Mars and van Krevelen."

[5] "The experimental barriers for propane ODH on supported vanadium oxide are in the range 2030 kcal/mol, (4,10,22) which are much lower than the value of about 80 kcal/mol found in this study for the water elimination step."

[6] "Our results point toward a possible reason as to why the interaction of vanadium oxide with a support may lower the barrier for the initial dissociative adsorption of propane and propene elimination steps in the ODH reaction pathways investigated here"

[7] "We have carried out a hybrid density functional study of mechanisms for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane on the (010) surface of V2O5. The surface was modeled using both vanadium oxide clusters and a periodic slab."

[8] "The potential energy surface is found to have large barriers, which are lowered somewhat when the possibility of a triplet state is considered."

[9] "The barriers on the reaction pathway are 4580 kcal/mol above the energy of the reactants, which are much larger than found experimentally for propane ODH on supported vanadia."

[1] "It has been found that, when propane is used as the reactant at 5OOC and 0.1 MPa, the BTX selectivity can be increased from ca. 10% (H-ZSM-5) to ca. 40 to 45% after treatment of the base zeolite with solutions of zinc or gallium nitrate, such that the final zinc or gallium content is ca. 1.0 mass-%."

[2] "On Zn-ZSM-5 part of the hydrogen atom pool lost on aromatization is released as dihydrogen and an improved BTX selectivity results."

[3] "It appears that Ga-ZSM-5 or GaZn-ZSM-5 catalysts operate in a similar manner, but gallium-containing samples are preferred since zinc volatilization occurs at the reaction temperatures used for samples containing zinc alone."

[4] "The contact time has been shown to have a strong influence on the product distribution obtained in these systems. To summarize, the observed selectivity to aromatics depends on the form of the zeolite used and on the contact time."

[5] "A comparative study of the conversion of propane, n-butane and i-butane over Zn-ZSM-5 reveals that the alkanes differ in terms of activity and BTX selectivity. i-Butane is the most reactive of the three alkanes and also yields the highest percentage hydrogen recovery as dihydrogen. However, it displays the lowest BTX selectivity."

[1] "Incorporation of zinc cations into high-silica zeolites enhances the selectivity of zeolite catalysts towards light alkane dehydrogenation and aromatization [13]."

[2] "It seems that the incorporated Zn2+ cations act as strong Lewis sites and change the mechanism of the alkane activation and transformation favoring a hydrogen removal step [2, 410]."

[3] "Analysis of the results on characterization of zinc species suggested that Zn/H-MFI involves three types of Zn species: small and large ZnO clusters and zinc cations."

[4] "For Zn/H-MFI sample used in this study with high Zn content, (OZ)(ZnOZn)2+(OZ) or (ZO)Zn+OSi cations should preferably form based on the literature data [2, 22]. However, the presence of Zn2+ or ZnOH+ cannot be excluded."

[5] "The mechanism of H/D exchange for propane involving Zn2+ cations is shown on Scheme 3. Zn2+ cations located at neighbouring [4] or distanly separated [10] basic oxygens of the Si O Al groups in the zeolite framework provide a heterolytic dissociative adsorption of propane and offer Zn-propyl species and acid protons of the SiOHAl group."

[6] "Regioselectivity of the exchange for Zn/H-MFI implies that the mechanism of the exchange changes, when the zeolite is modified with Zn."

[7] "For the case with Zn- containing H-MFI, the dehydrogenation of propane molecule to form carbenium ion can occur either on zinc cations or Lewis sites of subnanomeric custers of ZnO due to prevalence of these two Zn species in the zeolite [1, 23, 2629]."

[1] "The initial step in propane activation over Zn/H-MFI is dissociative adsorption over zinc oxide sites, leading to the formation of propyl zinc species and ZnOH groups."

[2] "At low partial pressure of the reactants, H2 recombinative desorption and hydrogen evolution is favoured, whereas at high pressures, implied under NMR batch conditions, the hydrogenolysis route is preferred."

[3] "The mechanism proposed for propane activation involves propane dissociation, followed by propene evolution and recombinative desorption of dihydrogen. Propene further oligomerizes over acidic sites, while dihydrogen either evolves as a final product or participates in propane hydrogenolysis into ethane and methane."

[4] "This mechanistic pathway explains the higher activity of Zn/H-MFI catalysts with respect to H-MFI and the lower selectivity to aromatics in comparison to Ga/H-MFI."

[5] "The development of in situ MAS NMR spectroscopic techniques [11] has allowed monitoring of the catalytic transformations directly on a catalyst surface during the course of the reaction."

[6] "Application of in situ 13C MAS NMR spectroscopy has enabled identification of the proposed detailed bifunctional mechanism of propane activation over Ga-modified acidic MFI zeolite [11a,11c,11e,12]."

"Recently we reported that silica supported zirconium hydride species was capable of room temperature activation of carbon-hydrogen bonds [1,2] and of the low temperature hydrogenolysis of alkanes to methane and ethane [2-4]."

"The exceptional properties of this catalyst in the field of C-H and C-C bond activation are ascribed to the very electrophilic (formally 8 electron) and sterically unhindered (four coordinate) nature of the zirconium hydride complex."

"The stoichiometric reaction between propane and (=- SiO)3ZrH leads to the formation of a mixture of (=- SiO)3ZrCH(CH3)2 and (-= SiO)3ZrCH2CH2CH3."

"The catalytic deuteration of propane by deuterium at room temperature catalysed by (=- SiO)3ZrH showed that the primary C-H bonds of propane reacted seven times faster than the secondary C-H bonds."

[1] "For supported metal oxides, it has been observed empirically that the decline in olefin selectivity with increasing alkane conversion decreases with increasing basicity of the support."

[2] "Figure 5 shows that the effects of the phosphorus/vanadium ratio on the selectivity of maleic anhydride formation via butane oxidation over supported vanadium phosphate catalysts."

[3] "The selectivity to maleic anhydride increases monotonically with increasing P/V (phosphorus/vanadium) ratio. Near-edge analysis of X-ray absorption spectra taken during butane oxidation suggest that the high selectivity to maleic anhydride observed when P/V = 2 is associated with the stabilization of a high proportion of the V in the 4+ oxidation state."

[4] "Figure 5 shows that while the value of k1 increases with increasing domain size, the ratio of k2/k1 decreases and the ratio of k3/k1 is independent of domain size. These results indicate that ODH requires large vanadia domains."

[5] "Cu/ZSM-5, where ZSM-5 is a type of zeolite with an MFI structure. Its activity is suppressed significantly by water vapor, which is present at 10% in engine exhaust. Fe/ZSM-5 is also very active and selective, and its activity remains high in the presence of water vapor"

[6] "For these catalysts, heating above the normal operating temperature must be prevented by proper engineering because of the low zeolite hydrothermal stability at high temperatures. In addition, the operating temperature window of these catalysts is rather narrow, and their efficiency depends on the nature of the hydrocarbon reductant. They are also sensitive to sulfur poisoning."

[7] "It is known that hydrothermal degradation of catalysts is associated with dealumination of the zeolite and migration and agglomeration of the metal ions and oxo complexes."

[1] "The catalytic activity of ZSM-5 is greatly improved by incorporating a metal cation (Mo or Zn)."
          [2] "MoHZSM-5 exhibited the best activity, while neither MoNaZSM-5 nor MoO3 has any activity for the reaction."
          [3] "The starting temperature for the dehydro-aromatization of methane over MoHZSM-5 is about 973 K, which is about 50 K lower than that over ZnHZSM-5."
          [4] "Ethene and H2 can be directly detected from TPAR and both evolved over MoHZSM-5 at about 973 K, which is the same temperature at which benzene evolved."
          [5] "The Mo modified ZSM-5 catalysts exhibited excellent catalytic activity and selectivity to benzene for the conversion of methane at 973 K under non-oxidizing conditions."
          [6] "We suggest that the activation of methane over HZSM-5 and MHZSM-5 zeolite catalysts is via the carbenium ion mechanism."
          [7] "In the case of ZnHZSM-5 catalyst, Zn2+ cations act as a hybride acceptor to give [Zn-H]+,"
          [8] "In the case of MoHZSM-5 catalyst, Mo6+ species in ZSM-5 zeolite may act as hybride acceptor to give [Mo-H]5+,"

[1] "Supported vanadium oxides are one of the best catalysts for the ODH of propane with high thermal stability and the large surface area."

          [2] "Generally, the activity and selectivity of the catalyst depends on its reducibility and basicity."

          [3] "To achieve high activity and selectivity the presence of highly dispersed vanadium is crucial."

          [4] "For a good catalyst, there is a compromise between the activity in CH bond activation and the easiness to release the propene molecule from the surface."

          [5] "From our study, for example, the reducibility of the O(2) site is indeed much facilitated by other surface atoms, which is a rather long-range effect."

          [6] "In supported catalysts, multiple lattice O species are available, including VO, VOV, and VOM sites (M is the metal cation from oxide supports). This introduces much flexibility in controlling the catalyst activity as the electronic structures of the two-coordinated O and the terminal VO in these systems can be very different from the V2O5 bulk."

          [7] "It is found that at low loadings vanadium is molecularly dispersed, whereas at higher loadings V2O5 crystallites start to appear."

          [8] "Overall, the vanadyl oxygen O(1) on the V2O5(001) surface is slightly more reactive in CH bond activation than is the O(2) atom. However, the propoxide on the O(2) is much easier to further decompose into propene."

          [9] "For the ODH reaction, the high activities in activating CH bond and in producing propene are two properties acting negatively to each other. It is expected that the activity of the oxide-supported vanadium can be tuned by controlling the polymerization extent and the support materials."

[1] "Silica-supported zirconium hydrides exhibit high activity towards olefin isomerization under mild conditions."

[2] "Recently it has been demonstrated that metal oxide-bound organozirconium complexes (1) [1, 2] undergo hydrogenolysis [3] to yield attached zirconium hydrides (2) which are highly active catalysts for ethylene polymerization."

[3] "We find that these supported organozirconium compounds inefficiently catalyze the isomerization of 1-butene to cis- and trans-2-butene at room temperature. However, high rates of isomerization are realized if the supported zirconium alkyl compounds are first hydrogenated."

[4] "The isomerization catalyst system derived from 2 is long lived either upon standing or under isomerization reaction conditions provided that air and water are rigorously excluded."

[5] "Rates of isomerization are sterically controlled, decreasing in the order 1-butene > 1-hexene > allylbenzene > methylenecyclohexane"

[6] "When a twentyfold molar excess of 1-butene was added to a toluene slurry of the catalyst, hydrogenation (H2, 1 atm, 25°C) to butane was complete within 30 h."

[1] "The activation of ethane over zinc- and gallium-modified HZSM-5 dehydrogenation catalysts was studied by diffuse reflectance infrared spectroscopy."

[2] "Hydrocarbon activation on HZSM-5 modified by bivalent Zn and univalent Ga cations proceeds via two distinctly different mechanisms."

[3] "The stronger molecular adsorption of ethane by the acidbase pairs formed by distantly separated cationic Zn21 and basic oxygen sites results already at room temperature in strong polarizability of adsorbed ethane and subsequent heterolytic dissociative adsorption at moderate temperatures."

[4] "In contrast, molecular adsorption of ethane on Ga1 cations is weak. At high temperatures dissociative hydrocarbon adsorption takes place, resulting in the formation of ethyl and hydride fragments coordinating to the cationic gallium species."

[5] "Whereas in the zinc case a Brnsted acid proton is formed upon ethane dissociation, decomposition of the ethyl fragment on gallium results in gallium dihydride species and does not lead to Brnsted acid protons."

[6] "This difference in alkane activation has direct consequences for hydrocarbon conversions involving dehydrogenation."

[7] "Zn/ZSM-5 displays a much higher conversion than Ga/ZSM-5. This corresponds to the finding that ethane is more readily activated over the zincoxygen acidbase pairs than over Ga1 cations."

[1] "Silica-supported zirconium hydrides15 draw recently much attention due to their ability to catalyse low-temperature olefin polymerization,12 CC bond hydrogenolysis in alkanes3 and polyolefins4 under mild conditions and H/D isotope exchange in alkanes.56"

[2] "Basset et al.36 considered the catalytic sites of alkane hydrogenolysis to be grafted zirconium monohydrides (SiO)3ZrH. On the other hand, Yermakov et al.1,2 considered grafted zirconium dihydrides (SiO)2ZrH2 as the catalytic sites in this system."

[3] "Thus, we concluded that zirconium dihydrides 2, which existence was postulated in 1977 by Yermakov et al.,2 unlike zirconium monohydrides 1, are capable to catalyse alkane hydrogenolysis under mild conditions."

[4] "A DFT study of CC bond hydrogenolysis in alkanes on silica-supported zirconium monohydrides (SiO)3ZrH and dihydrides (SiO)2ZrH2 shows that only the latter are capable of catalysing this process under mild conditions."

[5] "The data suggest that the hydrogenolysis of butane cannot proceed under mild conditions on supported zirconium monohydrides 1 by the Basset mechanism. The process is unfavourable from both kinetic and thermodynamic points of view."

[1] "Modification of these zeolites with Zn2+ ions inhibits cracking and increases the rate and selectivity of aromatization."

[2] "It is generally believed that this is connected with acceleration by the modifying Zn2+ ions of dehydrogenation of both light paraffins and the growing chains of oligomers."

[3] "For spectral measurements, the granulated zeolites with particle dimensions of 0.51 mm were transferred into another part of the optical cell equipped with a CaF2 window."

[4] "Reaction with zinc vapor at 770 K resulted in almost complete disappearance of both the narrow and the broad bands (the dashed line in Figure 1)."

[5] "Below 453 K such dissociative adsorption is irreversible, since the bands from the chemisorbed alkyl species and protons were not removed, even by a very prolonged evacuation."

[6] "The resulting ethylene is most likely involved in a subsequent reaction with acidic protons yielding the grafted oligomeric species that, after heating of the sample at high temperature, contributes to the DRIFT spectrum in the region of CH stretching vibrations."

"The high temperature oxidation of CH4 to HCHO may be carried out over pure SiO2 and V2O5/SiO5. In the single-pass mode, the HCHO yields do not exceed 34%; however, respectable spacetime-yields (STY) of about 1200 g/kg cat h at 30% selectivity have been achieved over a 2% V2O5/SiO2 catalyst at 600C [20]."

"Several bifunctional catalysts are known to promote this reaction, with the most thoroughly studied being a Mo/H-ZSM-5 zeolite [3538]."

"Most investigators agree that molybdenum carbide or oxycarbide is responsible for the conversion of CH4 to C2H4 and that the C2H4 is converted to aromatic products over the acidic sites within the channels of the zeolite."

"A W, Zn/H-ZSM-5 catalyst, prepared by Zhang and co-workers [38] via a controlled impregnation technique, is of particular interest because a CH4 conversion of 23% at 850C, with high benzene selectivity, has been observed."

"Over the better catalysts, which include SrO/La2O3 [25] and Mn/Na2WO4/SiO2 [26,27], a C2 selectivity of about 80% can be achieved at a CH4 conversion of 20%."

"Other metals including W and Fe are effective for promoting this reaction, and there is evidence that these metals are active as suboxides, rather than as carbides [37]."

[1] "Oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes provides a thermodynamically accessible route to the synthesis of alkenes from alkanes (13). Supported vanadium oxides (VOx) catalyze this reaction, but unselective combustion pathways limit alkene selectivities, especially at high conversions (418)."

[2] "The extent of dispersion and the local and extended structure of supported VOx species depend on the chemical identity and the surface area of the support (13, 17, 18)."

[3] "Polyvanadate species that form on ZrO2 at VOx surface densities above 34 VOx/nm2 provide active and selective sites for oxidative dehydrogenation reactions. Catalysts with lower VOx surface density and uncovered ZrO2 surfaces show lower alkene selectivities because of competing oxidation pathways leading to undesired CO and CO2 products."

[4] "Initial propene selectivities increase with increasing VOx surface density, as monovanadate species and exposed support sites, which favor primary combustion pathways, decrease in concentration."

[5] "Oxidative dehydrogenation rates per V-atom reach a maximum on VOx domains of intermediate size, which provide a balance between the activity of surface VOx species and their accessibility to reactants."

[6] "Interactions with supports determine the type of VOx structures present at a given surface density, but turnover rates do not depend on the identity of the support when differences in VOx structure are taken into account."

[1] "Zeolites are crystalline alumosilicates and as such are of no interest for redox reactions. Unlike other oxides, they have an intracrystalline system of micropores of molecular dimensions. Chemical composition of zeolites can be modified by transition metals due to their incorporation either into the crystal lattice or into the micropore space."

[2] "Modification with Fe is a special case. Unlike other metals, whose oxides initially exhibit some activity of the same sort as that after the introduction into the zeolite, iron atoms in ZSM-5 matrix acquire fundamentally new features compared to the free Fe2O3."

[3] "The iron loses its ability to activate O2, but acquires special affinity towards nitrous oxide, causing its decomposition in a particular way [53]. This reaction gives rise to the formation of a new form of surface oxygen (called a-oxygen [54]) which, as one can see further, is behind a unique performance of FeZSM-5 zeolites in the oxidation with N2O."

[4] "The study of parafn partial oxidation catalysts gave different observations [44]. In this case, to avoid overoxidation, the active sites (usually vanadium ions) must be isolated in the inert matrix of the support to prevent oxygen diffusion from the neighboring sites."

[5] "A detailed study of vanadium oxide supported on a variety of carriers [45] concluded that the presence of VOV fragments was essential for the selective oxidation."

[6] "Bulk oxides with the oxygen of low lability (MgO, ZnO, TiO2, etc.), or silica-supported oxides of V, Mo, W are usually used for this purpose."

[7] "The distribution of iron and other metals in zeolites has been studied extensively. In general, Fe can occupy three positions in ZSM-5 matrix [8487] and can exist as:
1. Isolated ions in tetrahedral positions of the crystal lattice;
2. Isolated ions or small complexes inside the intracrystalline micropore space;
3. Finely dispersed oxide phase on the outer surface of zeolite crystals."

[8] "Depending on Fe content and on the mode of catalyst activation, Ca can be regulated within several orders of magnitude, reaching up to nearly 100 mmol/g for the most active catalysts."

[9] "Experimentally, observed characteristics of a-oxygen can be explained by binuclear quantum chemical model of a-sites [92]."

[10] "According to recent quantum mechanical calculations [99], methane oxidation on FeZSM-5 proceeds with participation of binuclear complexes having Fe atoms bound by (m-oxo-) and (m-hydroxo-) bridges."

[11] "Recently, based on successful pilot plant operation, Solutia made an announcement of the jointly developed new process and shared its plans for fast-track commercialization [113]. Typical performance data from the Pensacola pilot plant are given in Table 7."

[1] "The zinc-exchanged (ZSM-5-Zn) and proton-exchanged (ZSM-5-H) forms of ZSM-5 zeolite have been studied for the conversion of propane to aromatic hydrocarbons at temperatures in the range 730-820 K."

[2] "ZSM-5-Zn was the more active and gave the better BTX selectivity (60-7OC%)."

[3] "The main features of the conversion mechanism are proposed involving propane dehydrogenation, followed by oligomerization and aromatization."

[4] "The primary dehydrogenation reaction is mechanistically different on the two types of catalyst: over ZSM-5-H dehydrogenation is rate controlled, while over ZSM-5-Zn this step is in quasi-equilibrium."

[5] "We suggest that this effect arises because the respective dehydrogenation steps are in quasi-equilibrium, with reaction 4 controlling the conversion and a dehydrogenation between aromatic and cyclic precursor controlling the BTX selectivity (both processes may well involve species of the type [Zn-H]+, c.f. reaction 4."

[6] "In the case of the ZSM-5-Zn catalyst, we suggest the zinc cation acts as a hydride acceptor to give a transient species such as [Zn-HI+ (and thence hydrogen)"

[7] "Over both ZSM-5-H and ZSM-5-Zn catalysts, ethane reactant was found to be much less reactive than propane: at 870 K the extent of ethane conversion was < 5%."

[8] "With both catalysts, as expected, the propane conversion fell with increasing space velocity but the product distributions behaved differently."

[9] "The apparent activation energies, obtained from Arrhenius plots of the propane conversions, were ZSM-5-Zn (I.28 wt% aluminium), 121+15 kJ mol-'; ZSM-5-Zn (0.71 wt% aluminium), 104+15 kJ mol-'; ZSM-5-H (1.28 wt% aluminium), 120t15 kJ mol-'."

[1] "Mo/HZSM-5 catalyst was prepared as described previously [1]. Mo-W/HZSM-5 was prepared by impregnating NH4ZSM-5 with aqueous solution of ammonium heptamolybdate and ammonium tungstate mixed from ttmgstic acid and aqueous ammonia."

[2] "The XRD, FT-IR and surface area results showed that Mo species are highly dispersed in the channels of the zeolite. The same seemed to occttr for MoW-ZSM-5 catalyst."

[3] "Pure methane can also be converted to aromatics over partially coked Mo/HZSM-5 and Mo-W/HZSM-5 catalysts at 873 K as can be seen in Table 2."

[4] "Results of the reaction of pure methane and natural gas (methane with some C2+ additive) over Mo/HZSM-5 catalyst are summarized in Table 2. It is shown that pure methane only can be converted to aromatics at 973 K [1]. However, the case is very different when we used natural gas as feed."

[5] "Natural gas, methane with C2+ additives at different methane purity, can even be converted to aromatics at the low temperature of 773 K and about 10-20% is obtained."

[6] "Conversion of methane to aromatics under non-oxidizing conditions can be initiated by higher hydrocarbon mixtures in the feed and, some special coke deposited on Mo/HZSM-5 catalyst at lower reaction temperature."

[1] "Additional evidence is presented for the role of gallium reduction in preparing active Ga/ZSM-5 catalysts for alkane aromatization."

[2] "Although reduction generates dispersed, active gallium species in zeolite channels, it is shown that for ethane dehydrogenation to aromatics the reduced (with hydrogen) Ga/ZSM-5 catalysts are not as active or selective as are materials which have been substantially reoxidized either by air or by traces of oxygen in inert gases."

[3] "Optimal catalysts for ethane aromatization are prepared by reduction with hydrogen to disperse the gallium, followed by reoxidation to a dispersed Ga3+ phase."

[4] "A substantially reduced catalyst (Ga+/Z- ca. 1) is both less active and selective for aromatics formation. Such catalysts also show lower hydrocracking activities than either unreduced or reoxidized materials, because of the reduction in Brønsted acidity associated with the transformation to Ga+Z- sites."

[5] "It is generally agreed that the primary role of extra-framework gallium in these materials is to enhance rates of alkene, diene, or cycloalkene dehydrogenation"

[6] "We propose that at the higher drying temperature used here (650 C) a small amount of Ga2O3 was reduced prior to the introduction of hydrogen, in agreement with the chemistry of bulk Ga2O3 at > 600 C"

[7] "The activity and aromatics selectivity for the series of Ga/HMFI catalysts generally followed the order B (reduced/oxidized) > C (reduced/He) > A (reduced) > D (reduced/oxidized/reduced)."

[8] "A combination of thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), and X-ray diffraction (XRD) studies has been used to confirm that rapid reoxidation takes place at 550C. However, the reoxidation does not regenerate β-Ga2O3, but rather a higher energy, dispersed Ga3+ which appears to be optimal for production of aromatics from ethane."

[9] "Reoxidized catalysts are stable under the reaction conditions used here (530-570°C, low hydrocarbon partial pressures), but are not stable to re-reduction by hydrogen at higher partial pressures."

[1] "Generally, zeolite protonic acidity is necessary for NO reduction: In contrast to H,Ga-ZSM-5, Na,Ga-ZSM-5 was inactive. The authors concluded that a synergism does exist between Ga species and H+ enabling the catalyst to activate the reductant (methane) for NO decomposition in the presence of O2."

[2] "Ga-modified ZSM-5 is far better than the Cu-modified version, which is even less active than unmodified ZSM-5. This indicates that the reaction can be accomplished to a considerable extent in the absence of any metal-related redox centers."

[3] "Framework gallium in an isolated tetrahedral environment cannot be reduced at moderate temperatures. The observed reducibility of gallium-modified zeolites therefore indicates the presence of nonframework gallium species."

[4] "Aromatization of liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) alkanes into aromatic components (mainly benzene, toluene, and xylenes, BTX) on Ga-modified ZSM-5 catalysts is commercialized in the Cyclar process jointly developed by UOP and BP."

[5] "Isomorphous substitution and replacement of exchangeable cations are important ways to modify zeolite properties for practical applications and have achieved considerable interest in the field of zeolite chemistry."

[6] "The chemical shift, δ, of a 29Si nucleus in a zeolite depends primarily on the number of T atoms in the first neighboring shell and on the TOT angles (T = tetrahedral species, Si, Al, Ga, Fe, Ge, etc.) of the bridging oxygen atoms that coordinate the 29Si nucleus."

[7] "Brnsted acidity within silicate-like materials is generated when tetravalent Si4+ is replaced with trivalent ions such as Al3+ or Ga3+."

[8] "Nonframework gallium is the source of Lewis acidity. Oxo cations GaO+ on exchange positions of the framework behave as Lewis acids."

[9] "Characteristically, IR vibration bands in both the hydroxyl region (wavenumbers beyond 3000 cm-1) and the framework region (wavenumbers below 1500 cm-1) are sensitive to the composition of the framework."

[1] "Ga and Zn species increase the rates of propane chemical conversion, recombinative hydrogen desorption, and deuterium incorporation from D2 into reaction products."

[2] "Disposal of hydrogen formed in C-H bond activation steps occurs by transfer of H-atoms to unsaturated species to form alkanes or to Ga and Zn species, which catalyze the recombinative desorption of H-atoms to form dihydrogen (H2)."

[3] "In-situ X-ray absorption studies suggest that Ga and Zn species reside at cation exchange sites as monomeric cations and that recombinative desorption involve reduction-oxidation cycles of such cations during each dehydrocyclodimerization turnover."

[4] "The addition of metal cations also increases the deuterium content in 'unreacted' propane (Fig. 18). The rate of incorporation of D-atoms into 'unreacted' propane provides an independent measure of the D-content in the surface pool"

[5] "Clearly, Ga and Zn species increase the reversibility of H-atom recombinative desorption steps and act as efficient 'portholes' for the removal of H-atoms produced during C-H bond activation steps."

[6] "The rate of propane dehydrocyclodimerization to form C6+ aromatics is limited by a sequence of irreversible dehydrogenation reactions leading to propene, higher alkenes, dienes, trienes, and aromatics."

[7] "Ga and Zn ions increase the rate of removal of alkenes from these oligomerization-cracking cycles. This removal must occur by the formation of products, such as aromatics (and H2) and alkanes, which are much less reactive than alkenes in acid-catalyzed reactions."

[1] "Zn-doped catalysts are well studied and one of them is used in the commercial Cyclar process."

          [2] "Zinc can be introduced to a zeolite by aqueous or solid ion exchange techniques. Action of the ZnCl2 vapour on H-ZSM5 also leads to a Zn-exchanged zeolite."

          [3] "The catalytic activity towards alkane aromatisation is due mainly to the ionic Zn2+ species."

          [4] "The first step of ethane and propane aromatisation in a Zn-doped zeolite catalyst is the dehydrogenation of these alkanes to the corresponding alkenes."

          [5] "The results obtained indicate that the reaction proceeds via a mechanism starting from the alkyl rupture of the ethane C–H bond (C2H5–•H–•), and the zinc cation acts as an acceptor of the alkyl group."

          [6] "The catalytic cycle for the alkyl activation consists of three elementary steps: (i) rupture of ethane C–H bond on the Zn–O–• pair; (ii) formation of ethene from the alkyl group bound to Zn; and (iii) formation of dihydrogen from the Brønsted proton and hydrogen bound to Zn."

          [7] "The selectivity of zeolite catalysts towards aromatisation of small alkanes can be greatly increased by incorporation of zinc or gallium ions."

[1] "Application of alternative oxidants in the form of various oxygen-containing molecules opens new possibilities. The idea of this approach is as follows. Variation of the oxidant chemistry should change the state of surface oxygen, while the activation of organic molecules may remain unchanged or affected to a smaller degree, thus providing new opportunity for controlling the selectivity."

[2] "In 1983, Iwamoto et al. [7] were the first to use N2O for the oxidation of benzene: [reaction equation] This reaction over a vanadia catalyst allowed achieving much better selectivity as compared to the oxidation by dioxygen. At 550 8C, the reaction selectivity exceeded 70%."

[3] "As for the nature of the catalytic activity, two different approaches were suggested. One of them is based on a traditional notion that zeolites are the acidic catalysts with strong Brønsted and Lewis sites. The other one relates to the common oxidation catalysis, which might be provided by the presence of a transition metal admixture."

[4] "Presently, one may conclude that the iron idea seems to be generally accepted, although the detailed structure and composition of α-sites till now are not perfectly clear and thus are the subject of many theoretical [54–60] and experimental [58,61–69] studies."

[5] "The reduced iron atoms of complex (III) appear to be inert to dioxygen. However, they are readily oxidized at elevated temperatures (over 200 8C) by nitrous oxide into complex (IV) to give adsorbed O a species. Namely, this reversible redox transition Fe2+ ↔ Fe3+ between complexes (III) and (IV) is considered to provide a selective transfer of oxygen atoms from N2O to hydrocarbon molecules to be oxidized."

[6] "Presently, many researchers are trying to use N2O for conducting various oxidation reactions by the catalytic way at elevated temperature. Quite good selectivities were achieved in the oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes [40,42,43] and in the epoxidation of propylene to propylene oxide [86]."

[7] "To suppress such side transformations and especially coking, leading to a heavy problem of the catalyst deactivation, the researchers are trying to neutralize various functional groups on the zeolite surface but leaving intact the α-sites. This is a difficult challenge."

[1] "High silica zeolites modified with gallium are known to be effective catalysts for promoting the dehydrogenation of light alkanes and subsequent aromatization of the thus produced alkenes."

[2] "The oxidized form of Ga/ZSM-5, where the main fraction of gallium ions is assumed to be present in the form of isolated gallyl ions, was found to be initially the most active for light alkane dehydrogenation."

[3] "We estimate formation of not more than three ethylene molecules per isolated GaO+ species before being reduced to Ga+. This, however, contradicts the recently reported observation of about 1000 catalytic cycles per oxidized gallium site in Ga/ZSM-5."

[4] "On the other hand, a low stability and, therefore, very high reactivity of the isolated gallyl ions may cause processes such as oligomerization of the isolated GaO+ species in the selectively oxidized Ga/ZSM-5 zeolite. In this case, a wide variety of different gallium oxide clusters can be generated."

[5] "The overall activation energy for ethane dehydrogenation over GaO+ sites in this case will not exceed 150 kJ mol-1. This value is about 25% lower than the one calculated for ethane dehydrogenation over the reduced Ga+ sites in ZSM-5 zeolite."

[6] "Although the initial alkyl activation of ethane is slightly more favorable as compared to the carbenium mechanism, subsequent chemical transformations of the reaction intermediates are easier in the latter case because of their lower stability."

[7] "The activation energies for the concerted C2H6 dehydrogenation paths are very close to those for the corresponding competitive elementary steps of the primary dehydrogenation route"

[1] "Aromatization of alkanes, which is well addressed in the literature,1h4 is an example of an economically important reaction. Ga and Zn zeolites have been used to promote this reaction and shown to exhibit a very high activity."

          [2] "The adsorption of methane on Zn-exchanged zeolites was studied theoretically by density functional theory (DFT). Diverse types of active sites were employed, such as: a Zn(II) cation, which was placed on dierent rings (4T and 5T), a ZnO (in a tetramer conguration) cluster and a [ZnOZn]2 dimer complex."

          [3] "Methane prefers to adsorb physically in a 3-fold conguration on Zn(II) at both 4T and 5T rings. This is not the case for ZnO and [ZnOZn]2 sites, in which the dissociative adsorption is more favorable."

          [4] "The [ZnOZn]2 site appears to be one of the active forms of the Zn cation on zeolites with a low Si/Al ratio. This site is more thermodynamically stable than both Zn(II) on 5T and (ZnO)4."

          [5] "Kazansky et al.9,12h14 have shown that both hydrogen and methane IR spectra demonstrated strong perturbation of their symmetric stretching vibration mode, when adsorbed on Zn-containing ZSM5."

          [6] "The dissociative adsorption of methane was also studied using the [ZnOZn]2 model. This dissociation is an exothermic reaction but not as exothermic as calculated for this reaction on (ZnO)4 clusters. Interestingly, the dissociation also follows the alkyl pathway, which forms the methyl carbanion."

[1] "It has been demonstrated that the nature and the dispersion of the metal oxide phase have a great inuence on the catalysts behavior."

          [2] "Likewise, Irusta et al. [16] demonstrated that the presence of vanadium oxide species with terminal oxygen sites (V=O) is needed for the oxidation to oxygenates whereas the presence of species without terminal V=O sites leads to the formation of complete oxidation products."

          [3] "Three different types of supported tungsten species are present in W/HZSM-5 catalysts: isolated tetrahedral W2^4 species probably grafted to the Bro^nsted acid sites of the zeolite, octahedral polymeric species such as polytungstates and WO3 crystallites."

          [4] "The relative amounts of these three types of species changes significantly with tungsten loading. At low contents of tungsten tetrahedral species predominates and they are mainly located in the channels of the zeolite. For higher loading the amount and the size of the polytungstate species increases gradually causing a decrease in the dispersion and the partial blocking up of the HZMS-5 zeolite."

          [5] "Formaldehyde selectivity seems to be related to the dispersion of the tungsten oxide phase, which, in turn, is influenced by the metal loading."

          [6] "It has been reported that both active oxygen ions and Bro^nsted acidic sites on HZSM-5 are active centers for methane activation"

          [7] "The active centers of the partial oxidation to formaldehyde over W/HZSM-5 are in the supported tungsten oxide phase."

          [8] "HZSM-5 zeolite shows higher activity in methane conversion but does not lead to formaldehyde production."

[1] "Acid ZSM-5 zeolites modified by gallium ions are known to be active catalysts for the aromatization of light paraffins [1]."

[2] "Modification of the hydrogen form by gallium was carried out by incipient wetness impregnation with an aqueous solution of Ga(NO3)3. The amount of modifying gallium ions was chosen to be 5 wt% corresponding to a Ga/Al atomic ratio of about unity."

[3] "After reduction in hydrogen at 773 K the intensity of the DRIFT band from acidic OH groups around 3610 cm−1 gradually decreased. This indicates substitution of the bridging hydroxyl groups by the modifying gallium ions."

[4] "Reduction of GaZSM-5 in hydrogen at 773 K and subsequent prolonged evacuation at 873 K did not show any infrared bands in the spectral range of 1900–2100 cm−1 associated with gallium hydrides [17]. These bands were also not observed after admission of hydrogen to the evacuated samples at room temperature. However, heating of such samples in a hydrogen atmosphere to 773 K with subsequent cooling of the zeolite in hydrogen to room temperature resulted in the appearance of two bands with maxima at 2041 and 2059 cm−1 (Fig. 5). We surmise that these bands relate to two different kinds of gallium hydrides."

[5] "When the gallium-modified samples were reduced in hydrogen at 773 K, we observed that the bands from carbon monoxide adsorbed by hydroxyl groups at 2120 and 2168 cm1 did not appear after CO exposure at room temperature (Fig. 9). This coheres with the complete substitution of acidic protons by reduced Ga+ ions"

[6] "Oxidative treatment of univalent gallium or gallium dihydrides with N2O results in their oxidation into singly positively charged oxo-ions"

[1] "Besides oxidative activation such as oxidative coupling of methane to C2+, non-oxidative activation of methane to produce aromatics over Mo/HZSM-5 catalysts in a continuous flow mode has attracted significant interest since 1993."

[2] "The catalysts and reaction conditions are presented. Emphasis has been focused on the modification of catalysts and optimization of reaction conditions."

[3] "The channel structure and acidity of HZSM-5 zeolite and the valence and location of Mo species are the crucial factors for the catalytic performance"

[4] "Generally speaking, the channel structure and acidity of the HZSM-5 and the valence and location of the Mo species on/in the zeolite are crucial factors for its catalytic performance."

[5] "The induction period of the reaction is commonly recognized, in which Mo6+ species possibly located on the external surface of the support are partially reduced or reduced to Mo2C, mainly yielding H2O, CO, CO2 and H2."

[6] "All the experiments showed that various pre-treatments and different reaction conditions, such as pre-treatment atmosphere [25,29,38] and temperature [28,36,40], reaction temperature [25,29], pressure [19,43], methane space velocity [24,25,28,43], and regeneration [25,36], exerted great influences on the catalytic performance."

[1] "We report here that a zirconium hydride complex, grafted onto the surface of silica, acquires such high electrophilic properties, that the reaction of o-bond metathesis between the Zr hydride and the C-H bonds of cyclooctane and methane becomes feasible."

          [2] "The silica surface enhances the electrophilicity of the zirconium centre, allowing the reaction of C-H activation of alkanes."

          [3] "This increase in the electrophilic character of the metal is probably related to the stabilization of an 8e-Zr by the surface siloxy ligands, while molecular analogues are usually stabilized by two cyclopentadienyl ligands and thus have a 16e-configuration."

          [4] "A common feature of these complexes is that the metal is in its highest oxidation state; it therefore, has a do electron configuration and is consequently highly electrophilic."

[1] "ZSM-5 zeolites modified with Cu+ ions were prepared either by the high-temperature chemical reaction of hydrogen form with CuCl vapour or by the wet ion exchange with subsequent reduction of the modified samples in CO at 873 K."

          [2] "Adsorption of H2, N2 or C2H6 by Cu+ ions was studied by DRIFTS and by volumetric technique. The conclusions about the structure of adsorption complexes were supported by the DFT cluster quantum chemical calculations."

          [3] "The DFT cluster modelling indicated that both adsorption of hydrogen and ethane could be explained by interaction with the isolated Cu+ ions localized at the a sites of the ZSM-5 framework."

          [4] "Quantum chemical calculations indicated the important role in the bonding of adsorbed hydrogen and ethane of electron back donation from dp-orbitals of Cu+ ions to the s*HH or CH orbitals."

          [5] "The copper modified ZSM-5 zeolits (CuZSM-5) are known to exhibit a high-catalytic activity in selective decomposition of NO into molecular oxygen and nitrogen"

          [6] "It was concluded that such unusual properties of adsorbed C2H6 molecules resulted from formation of a rather strong s-type adsorption complexes with the exchanged univalent copper cations."

          [7] "Adsorption of H2 by a part of Cu+ ions in CuZSM-5 results in a very strong perturbation of adsorbed molecules, which is evident from the very strong low-frequency shift of the corresponding HH stretching frequencies."

[1] "Gallium-containing ZSM-5 formulations are industrially preferred mainly due to the high volatility of zinc, and our discussion below describes the synthesis and catalytic function of these Ga-based formulations."

[2] "The aromatization of liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) alkanes to aromatics (mainly benzene, toluene, and xylenes, BTX) on Ga-modified ZSM-5 catalysts is commercialized in the Cyclar process jointly developed by UOP and BP."

[3] "Ga3 cations, in the as-prepared catalysts, irrespective of the preparation technique, are re-dispersed under the strongly reducing conditions and high temperatures prevalent during aromatization resulting in the active formulation of the catalyst."

[4] "Wet impregnation of HZSM-5 with gallium salt solutions (Gallium nitrate in general) guarantees gallium deposition on the catalyst, nevertheless, most of the gallium is found to be located on the outside of the zeolite crystals as evidenced by XPS and electron microscopy studies."

[5] "The gallium sites were considered to participate in alkane activation by dehydrogenation to form alkenes and hydrogenolysis to generate methane, adsorption/desorption of unsaturated compounds, dehydrogenation of olefinic compounds to give dienes and dehydrogenation of napthenic compounds to aromatics."

[6] "Based on setting the gallium parameters to be zero, the authors were also able to comment on the relative importance of gallium sites for various mechanisms. Gallium sites were calculated to result in the formation of 90% of the dienes and 50% of the aromatic molecules for propane aromatization."

[7] "The introduction of gallium was observed to increase the dehydrogenation rate constant by a factor of 7, while the protolytic cracking rate was not observed to be significantly altered."

[8] "Experimental data were generated at a hydrocarbon pressure of 1 bar, at a temperature of 803 K on a HZSM-5 material with Si/Al  27 for olefin aromatization (at 2-3 minutes on stream to avoid catalyst deactivation) and Si/Al  40 for propane aromatization. The gallium loading on these materials was 4 wt.%."

[1] "Supported vanadium oxides are particularly noteworthy because the active sites possibly involve isolated VO species (in contrast to the other systems based on MoOx or WOx)."

[2] "Both too low and too high surface V densities are detrimental to high selectivities, and this has been associated with the combustion of the thus-formed alkenes into COx on the support and/or the polymeric V species."

[3] "Overall, silica can be regarded as the optimal support in terms of selectivity. Another important fact is that the optimal temperature window for this process is quite narrow, and around 500 C, lower temperatures favor combustion while unselective gas phase reactions start to be competitive at higher temperatures (>550 C)."

[4] "Metal exchange zeolites (M-zeolites) have concentrated a large research effort, because of their ability to transform alkanes into alkenes and aromatics."

[5] "For instance, the Cyclar and related processes (aroforming or Z-forming) typically use Ga-zeolite to convert in a single step liquefied petroleum gas (LPG), composed of propane and butane, into H2 and liquid aromatics, i.e., benzene, toluene, and xylenes."

[6] "Ga-zeolites act as a multifunctional catalyst, and one of the key steps, the formation of alkenes from alkanes, takes place at Ga sites and involves a CH bond activation and formation of a Gaalkyl intermediate."

[7] "Zn-zeolites display a very similar reactivity pattern: H2 and alkane activation, H/D exchange, formation of aromatics from alkanes, and the coaromatization of methane and alkane."

[1] "γ -Al2O3-supported vanadium oxide catalysts (06.3 wt% V atoms) were prepared, characterized, and tested for the oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of both ethane and n-butane."

[2] "While the catalytic activity in the ODH reactions increases with the vanadium loading, the selectivity to the corresponding olefins shows a maximum for catalysts with 34 wt% V atoms."

[3] "Associated VO4 tetrahedra were observed by 51V-NMR on catalysts with V loading lower than 5 wt%, while VO6 octahedra were predominant on catalysts with higher V loading."

[4] "Although catalysts with octahedral V5+ species show higher catalytic activity, higher selectivity to oxydehydrogenation reactions was achieved on catalysts in which mainly tetrahedral V5+ species were observed."

[5] "The number and nature of the acid sites also change with the vanadium loading. Thus, Lewis acid sites were observed mainly on catalysts with low V loading, while both Lewis and Brnsted acid sites were observed on catalysts with high V loading."

[6] "Although V5+ species were observed mainly on calcined samples, V4+ species are observed on tested catalysts and their concentration depends on the alkane conversions used in the catalytic tests."

[7] "The reaction was studied in the temperature interval 450600C using an ethane/oxygen/helium molar ratio of 4/8/88."

[1] "We examine possible reaction mechanisms for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane by supported transition metal oxide catalysts. Specifically we are interested in V2O5 supported on SiO22,12,13 and consider monomeric OV(O)3 surface species, which together with dimeric and oligomeric V2O5 species are present on catalyst surfaces with low V2O5 loadings."

[2] "Hydrogen abstraction by the vanadyl oxygen atom is the initial step in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane by supported vanadium oxide species. The diradical intermediate that is reached via the diradicaloid transition structure Ts1 consists of a propyl radical attached to a HOV(O)3 site and has similar energies in the singlet and triplet states (Int2)."

[3] "For V2O5/SiO2 catalysts with vanadium surface coverages below 3 V/nm2 (i.e., below the limit at which V2O5 crystallites start to appear) turnover frequencies (TOF) of around 0.01 s-1 (748 K) 37 and 0.3 × 10-3 s-1 (623 K) 38 have been observed for propene formation."

[4] "Comparison with recent DFT calculations for V2O5(001) crystal surfaces9 indicates that vanadia sites may be significantly more active in the ODH of propane if they are part of the bulk surface and not supported as monomers on silica. However, apparent turnover frequencies may be lower for V2O5 crystallites on the surface because only a fraction of sites is accessible in three-dimensional particles."

[5] "The initial step is hydrogen abstraction from propane by the vanadyl oxygen atom leading to a diradical intermediate, namely, C3H7•·HOVIV(O)3."

[6] "We analyzed possible reaction mechanisms for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane by monomeric vanadium oxide species on silica."

[7] "Desorption of propyl radicals leads to a stationary concentration of propyl in the gas phase and leaves reduced HOVIV(O)3 sites on the surface. Due to fast reoxidation their concentration is much smaller than the concentration of OVV sites (Int0)."

[8] "We investigate possible mechanisms of oxidative dehydrogenation of propane using density functional theory. Monomeric vanadium oxide species supported on silica are modeled by vanadyl-substituted silsesquioxane."

[9] "The initial CH bond activation step is hydrogen abstraction by the vanadyl (OVV) group yielding a diradical intermediate in which a propyl radical is bound to a HOVIV site."

[10] "We predict that at 750 K the apparent activation energy is 123  5 kJ/mol and the rate constant is about 0.26 s-1, in close agreement with experiments."

[11] "The first hydrogen abstraction occurs exclusively on OVV sites, while the second hydrogen abstraction can also occur on VOSi bridging oxygen sites."

[1] "Several different compounds, particularly silica supported metal oxides [1,2] were used in the process. Recently it has been mentioned that ZSM-5 [3] and ZSM-5 combined with molybdenum [4,5] or tungsten [6] were investigated. Silica supported V2O5 and MoO3 were used most frequently. They are considered to be the most effective in the production of formaldehyde [7,8]."

[2] "Fe-ZSM-5 was used as a catalyst for the room temperature methane oxidation by N2O [1317]. The activation of methane over Fe-ZSM-5 is believed to be similar to methane activation in MMO thus to employ a redox mechanism."

[3] "The reaction was carried out at the atmospheric pressure at 350650 8C. ZSM-5 molecular sieves with the iron and silicon tetrahedral framework were used as catalysts. The Si/Fe molar ratio was 45, 34 and 22. Fe-ZSM-5 was applied both in the sodium and hydrogen form."

[4] "Higher values of methane conversion were acquired when Fe-HZSM-5 (31.51% for Si/Fe = 22) was used. Fe-NaZSM-5 resulted in procuring higher values of the selectivity of the oxidation of methane to methanol (74% for Si/Fe = 45)."

[5] "It was found that increasing the temperature as well as extending the contact time increases the conversion of methane to methanol and at the same time lowers the value of the selectivity of the oxidation of methane to methanol."

[6] "Increasing the iron content resulted in the rise of methane conversion. The selectivity of the oxidation of methane to oxygenates displayed a slight grow along with the drop of the iron content, while the selectivity of methane oxidation to carbon dioxide was falling."
