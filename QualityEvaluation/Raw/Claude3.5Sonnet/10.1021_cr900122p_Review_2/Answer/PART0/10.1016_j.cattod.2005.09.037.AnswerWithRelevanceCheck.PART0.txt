          [1] "ZSM-5 zeolites modified with Cu+ ions were prepared either by the high-temperature chemical reaction of hydrogen form with CuCl vapour or by the wet ion exchange with subsequent reduction of the modified samples in CO at 873 K."

          [2] "Adsorption of H2, N2 or C2H6 by Cu+ ions was studied by DRIFTS and by volumetric technique. The conclusions about the structure of adsorption complexes were supported by the DFT cluster quantum chemical calculations."

          [3] "The DFT cluster modelling indicated that both adsorption of hydrogen and ethane could be explained by interaction with the isolated Cu+ ions localized at the a sites of the ZSM-5 framework."

          [4] "Quantum chemical calculations indicated the important role in the bonding of adsorbed hydrogen and ethane of electron back donation from dp-orbitals of Cu+ ions to the s*HH or CH orbitals."

          [5] "The copper modified ZSM-5 zeolits (CuZSM-5) are known to exhibit a high-catalytic activity in selective decomposition of NO into molecular oxygen and nitrogen"

          [6] "It was concluded that such unusual properties of adsorbed C2H6 molecules resulted from formation of a rather strong s-type adsorption complexes with the exchanged univalent copper cations."

          [7] "Adsorption of H2 by a part of Cu+ ions in CuZSM-5 results in a very strong perturbation of adsorbed molecules, which is evident from the very strong low-frequency shift of the corresponding HH stretching frequencies."

          The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts, particularly Cu-ZSM-5 zeolites, significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations. Key factors include:

          1. Preparation method: Cu-ZSM-5 can be prepared by high-temperature reaction with CuCl vapor or wet ion exchange followed by CO reduction at 873 K. This affects the distribution and nature of Cu+ sites.

          2. Cu+ ion location: Isolated Cu+ ions localized at a-sites in the ZSM-5 framework play a crucial role in adsorption and catalysis.

          3. Electronic interactions: Electron back-donation from Cu+ dp-orbitals to adsorbate antibonding orbitals (s*HH or CH) is important for strong adsorption of H2 and C2H6.

          4. Adsorption properties: Cu-ZSM-5 exhibits unusually strong adsorption of H2, N2, and C2H6, which affects reactivity. This results in strong perturbation of adsorbed molecules, evident from significant shifts in vibrational frequencies.

          5. Catalytic activity: Cu-ZSM-5 shows high catalytic activity for NO decomposition, demonstrating its potential in environmental applications.

          The study employs multiple characterization techniques, including DRIFTS, volumetric measurements, and DFT calculations, to understand the nature of adsorption sites and the mechanisms of molecule-catalyst interactions. This comprehensive approach provides valuable insights into the fundamental aspects of catalyst behavior, which is crucial for optimizing industrial processes involving alkane transformations and other reactions.

          金属基催化剂，特别是Cu-ZSM-5沸石的组成、结构和反应条件显著影响烷烃转化的机理和效率。主要因素包括：

          1. 制备方法：Cu-ZSM-5可通过与CuCl蒸气的高温反应或湿法离子交换后在873 K下CO还原制备。这影响Cu+位点的分布和性质。

          2. Cu+离子位置：定位于ZSM-5框架a位点的孤立Cu+离子在吸附和催化中起关键作用。

          3. 电子相互作用：Cu+ dp轨道到吸附质反键轨道（s*HH或CH）的电子反馈对H2和C2H6的强吸附很重要。

          4. 吸附性质：Cu-ZSM-5表现出对H2、N2和C2H6异常强的吸附，这影响其反应活性。这导致吸附分子的强烈扰动，从振动频率的显著变化可以观察到。

          5. 催化活性：Cu-ZSM-5对NO分解表现出高催化活性，显示了其在环境应用中的潜力。

          该研究采用多种表征技术，包括DRIFTS、体积测量和DFT计算，以了解吸附位点的性质和分子-催化剂相互作用的机制。这种综合方法为催化剂行为的基本方面提供了宝贵的见解，这对优化涉及烷烃转化和其他反应的工业过程至关重要。
