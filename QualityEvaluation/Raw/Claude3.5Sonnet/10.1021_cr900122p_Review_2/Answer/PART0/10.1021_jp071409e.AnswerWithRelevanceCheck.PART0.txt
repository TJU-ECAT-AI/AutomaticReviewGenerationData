          [1] "We examine possible reaction mechanisms for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane by supported transition metal oxide catalysts. Specifically we are interested in V2O5 supported on SiO22,12,13 and consider monomeric OV(O)3 surface species, which together with dimeric and oligomeric V2O5 species are present on catalyst surfaces with low V2O5 loadings."

[2] "Hydrogen abstraction by the vanadyl oxygen atom is the initial step in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane by supported vanadium oxide species. The diradical intermediate that is reached via the diradicaloid transition structure Ts1 consists of a propyl radical attached to a HOV(O)3 site and has similar energies in the singlet and triplet states (Int2)."

[3] "For V2O5/SiO2 catalysts with vanadium surface coverages below 3 V/nm2 (i.e., below the limit at which V2O5 crystallites start to appear) turnover frequencies (TOF) of around 0.01 s-1 (748 K) 37 and 0.3 × 10-3 s-1 (623 K) 38 have been observed for propene formation."

[4] "Comparison with recent DFT calculations for V2O5(001) crystal surfaces9 indicates that vanadia sites may be significantly more active in the ODH of propane if they are part of the bulk surface and not supported as monomers on silica. However, apparent turnover frequencies may be lower for V2O5 crystallites on the surface because only a fraction of sites is accessible in three-dimensional particles."

[5] "The initial step is hydrogen abstraction from propane by the vanadyl oxygen atom leading to a diradical intermediate, namely, C3H7•·HOVIV(O)3."

[6] "We analyzed possible reaction mechanisms for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane by monomeric vanadium oxide species on silica."

[7] "Desorption of propyl radicals leads to a stationary concentration of propyl in the gas phase and leaves reduced HOVIV(O)3 sites on the surface. Due to fast reoxidation their concentration is much smaller than the concentration of OVV sites (Int0)."

[8] "We investigate possible mechanisms of oxidative dehydrogenation of propane using density functional theory. Monomeric vanadium oxide species supported on silica are modeled by vanadyl-substituted silsesquioxane."

[9] "The initial CH bond activation step is hydrogen abstraction by the vanadyl (OVV) group yielding a diradical intermediate in which a propyl radical is bound to a HOVIV site."

[10] "We predict that at 750 K the apparent activation energy is 123  5 kJ/mol and the rate constant is about 0.26 s-1, in close agreement with experiments."

[11] "The first hydrogen abstraction occurs exclusively on OVV sites, while the second hydrogen abstraction can also occur on VOSi bridging oxygen sites."

          The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts, particularly supported vanadium oxides, significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations in oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) processes.

Composition and Structure:
1. The catalysts consist of V2O5 supported on SiO2, with monomeric OV(O)3 surface species, along with dimeric and oligomeric V2O5 species at low V2O5 loadings.
2. The vanadium surface coverage is crucial, with optimal activity observed below 3 V/nm2, before V2O5 crystallites start to form.
3. The active sites are modeled as vanadyl-substituted silsesquioxane, representing monomeric vanadium oxide species on silica.

Reaction Mechanism:
1. The initial step involves hydrogen abstraction by the vanadyl (OVV) oxygen atom, forming a diradical intermediate (C3H7•·HOVIV(O)3).
2. The first hydrogen abstraction occurs exclusively on OVV sites, while the second can also happen on VOSi bridging oxygen sites.
3. Desorption of propyl radicals leads to a stationary concentration in the gas phase and leaves reduced HOVIV sites on the surface.
4. Fast reoxidation maintains a low concentration of reduced sites compared to OVV sites.

Reaction Conditions and Efficiency:
1. Temperature significantly affects the reaction kinetics. At 750 K, the apparent activation energy is predicted to be 123 ± 5 kJ/mol, with a rate constant of about 0.26 s-1.
2. For V2O5/SiO2 catalysts with vanadium surface coverages below 3 V/nm2, turnover frequencies (TOF) of around 0.01 s-1 at 748 K and 0.3 × 10-3 s-1 at 623 K have been observed for propene formation.

Industrial Significance:
1. The ability to fine-tune catalyst composition, structure, and reaction conditions allows for optimization of catalyst performance.
2. Understanding the reaction mechanism and kinetics helps in designing more efficient catalysts for industrial applications.
3. The comparison between supported monomers and bulk V2O5 surfaces suggests potential for improving catalyst activity, although accessibility of active sites in three-dimensional particles may limit apparent turnover frequencies.

These factors contribute to the industrial importance of supported vanadium oxide catalysts in alkane transformation processes, particularly in the production of valuable chemical intermediates from alkanes.

          金属基催化剂，特别是负载型钒氧化物的组成、结构和反应条件显著影响烷烃在氧化脱氢（ODH）过程中的转化机理和效率。

组成和结构：
1. 催化剂由负载在SiO2上的V2O5组成，在低V2O5负载量时，包含单体OV(O)3表面物种以及二聚体和寡聚体V2O5物种。
2. 钒的表面覆盖度至关重要，最佳活性观察到在3 V/nm2以下，即V2O5晶体开始形成之前。
3. 活性位点被模拟为钒酰基取代的倍半硅氧烷，代表硅胶上的单体钒氧化物物种。

反应机理：
1. 初始步骤涉及钒酰基（OVV）氧原子进行氢提取，形成双自由基中间体（C3H7•·HOVIV(O)3）。
2. 第一次氢提取仅在OVV位点发生，而第二次也可以在VOSi桥接氧位点上进行。
3. 丙基自由基的脱附导致气相中的稳态浓度，并在表面留下还原的HOVIV位点。
4. 快速再氧化使还原位点的浓度相对于OVV位点保持较低。

反应条件和效率：
1. 温度显著影响反应动力学。在750 K时，预测表观活化能为123 ± 5 kJ/mol，速率常数约为0.26 s-1。
2. 对于钒表面覆盖度低于3 V/nm2的V2O5/SiO2催化剂，在748 K时丙烯生成的转化频率（TOF）约为0.01 s-1，在623 K时为0.3 × 10-3 s-1。

工业重要性：
1. 能够精细调节催化剂组成、结构和反应条件，使得催化剂性能得以优化。
2. 理解反应机理和动力学有助于设计更高效的工业应用催化剂。
3. 支持的单体与体相V2O5表面的比较表明提高催化剂活性的潜力，尽管三维颗粒中活性位点的可及性可能限制表观转化频率。

这些因素促进了负载型钒氧化物催化剂在烷烃转化过程中的工业重要性，特别是在从烷烃生产有价值的化学中间体方面。
