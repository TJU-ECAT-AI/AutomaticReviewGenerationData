          [1] "Mo/HZSM-5 catalyst was prepared as described previously [1]. Mo-W/HZSM-5 was prepared by impregnating NH4ZSM-5 with aqueous solution of ammonium heptamolybdate and ammonium tungstate mixed from ttmgstic acid and aqueous ammonia."

[2] "The XRD, FT-IR and surface area results showed that Mo species are highly dispersed in the channels of the zeolite. The same seemed to occttr for MoW-ZSM-5 catalyst."

[3] "Pure methane can also be converted to aromatics over partially coked Mo/HZSM-5 and Mo-W/HZSM-5 catalysts at 873 K as can be seen in Table 2."

[4] "Results of the reaction of pure methane and natural gas (methane with some C2+ additive) over Mo/HZSM-5 catalyst are summarized in Table 2. It is shown that pure methane only can be converted to aromatics at 973 K [1]. However, the case is very different when we used natural gas as feed."

[5] "Natural gas, methane with C2+ additives at different methane purity, can even be converted to aromatics at the low temperature of 773 K and about 10-20% is obtained."

[6] "Conversion of methane to aromatics under non-oxidizing conditions can be initiated by higher hydrocarbon mixtures in the feed and, some special coke deposited on Mo/HZSM-5 catalyst at lower reaction temperature."

          The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts, particularly Mo/HZSM-5 and Mo-W/HZSM-5, significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations in zeolite-catalyzed reactions:

1. Catalyst composition: Mo/HZSM-5 and Mo-W/HZSM-5 catalysts are used, with Mo and W acting as active metal components supported on HZSM-5 zeolite.

2. Catalyst structure: The metal species (Mo and W) are highly dispersed in the zeolite channels, as evidenced by XRD, FT-IR, and surface area measurements. This dispersion likely contributes to their catalytic activity.

3. Reaction conditions:
   - Temperature: Pure methane conversion requires high temperatures (973 K), while natural gas can be converted at lower temperatures (773-873 K).
   - Feed composition: The presence of C2+ additives in natural gas allows for conversion at lower temperatures compared to pure methane.
   - Catalyst state: Partially coked catalysts can convert pure methane at lower temperatures (873 K) compared to fresh catalysts.

4. Mechanisms: The presence of C2+ hydrocarbons or specific types of coke on the catalyst surface appears to initiate methane conversion, possibly by forming reactive intermediates.

5. Efficiency: Conversion rates of 10-20% can be achieved at lower temperatures (773 K) with natural gas feed, which is significant for potential industrial applications.

These factors contribute to the industrial significance of these catalysts by potentially allowing for lower operating temperatures, which could lead to energy savings and improved process economics in alkane transformation processes. The ability to use natural gas directly as a feedstock also enhances the industrial relevance of this catalytic system.

          金属基催化剂，特别是Mo/HZSM-5和Mo-W/HZSM-5的组成、结构和反应条件，显著影响了沸石催化反应中烷烃转化的机理和效率：

1. 催化剂组成：使用了Mo/HZSM-5和Mo-W/HZSM-5催化剂，Mo和W作为活性金属成分负载在HZSM-5沸石上。

2. 催化剂结构：金属物种（Mo和W）高度分散在沸石通道中，这一点通过XRD、FT-IR和表面积测量得到证实。这种分散可能有助于其催化活性。

3. 反应条件：
   - 温度：纯甲烷转化需要高温（973 K），而天然气可以在较低温度下转化（773-873 K）。
   - 进料组成：天然气中C2+添加剂的存在允许在较低温度下进行转化，相比纯甲烷。
   - 催化剂状态：部分积碳的催化剂可以在较低温度（873 K）下转化纯甲烷，相比新鲜催化剂。

4. 机理：催化剂表面上C2+烃类或特定类型积碳的存在似乎能够启动甲烷转化，可能是通过形成活性中间体。

5. 效率：在较低温度（773 K）下使用天然气进料可以达到10-20%的转化率，这对潜在的工业应用具有重要意义。

这些因素通过潜在地允许较低的操作温度来促进这些催化剂的工业重要性，这可能导致烷烃转化过程中的能源节约和改善的工艺经济性。直接使用天然气作为原料的能力也增强了该催化系统的工业相关性。
