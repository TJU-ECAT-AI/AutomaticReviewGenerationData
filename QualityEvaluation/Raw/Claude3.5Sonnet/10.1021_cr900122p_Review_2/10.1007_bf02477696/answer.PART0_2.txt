[1] "Mo/HZSM-5 catalyst was prepared as described previously [1]. Mo-W/HZSM-5 was prepared by impregnating NH4ZSM-5 with aqueous solution of ammonium heptamolybdate and ammonium tungstate mixed from ttmgstic acid and aqueous ammonia."

[2] "Results of the reaction of pure methane and natural gas (methane with some C2+ additive) over Mo/HZSM-5 catalyst are summarized in Table 2. It is shown that pure methane only can be converted to aromatics at 973 K [1]. However, the case is very different when we used natural gas as feed."

[3] "Natural gas, methane with C2+ additives at different methane purity, can even be converted to aromatics at the low temperature of 773 K and about 10-20% is obtained."

[4] "Pure methane can also be converted to aromatics over partially coked Mo/HZSM-5 and Mo-W/HZSM-5 catalysts at 873 K as can be seen in Table 2."

The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations:

1. Catalyst composition: Mo/HZSM-5 and Mo-W/HZSM-5 catalysts were studied. The addition of tungsten to the molybdenum-based catalyst appears to enhance its performance.

2. Catalyst structure: The metal species (Mo and W) are highly dispersed in the zeolite channels, which likely contributes to their catalytic activity.

3. Reaction conditions: 
   - Temperature: Pure methane conversion requires high temperatures (973 K), while natural gas can be converted at lower temperatures (773-873 K).
   - Feed composition: The presence of C2+ additives in natural gas allows for conversion at lower temperatures compared to pure methane.
   - Catalyst state: Partially coked catalysts can convert pure methane at lower temperatures (873 K) compared to fresh catalysts.

4. Mechanisms: The presence of C2+ hydrocarbons or coke on the catalyst surface appears to initiate the conversion process, allowing for lower temperature reactions.

5. Efficiency: Conversion rates of 10-20% can be achieved at lower temperatures (773 K) with natural gas feed, which is significant for potential industrial applications.

These factors contribute to the industrial significance of these catalysts by potentially allowing for lower operating temperatures, which could lead to energy savings and improved process economics in alkane transformation processes.

金属基催化剂的组成、结构和反应条件显著影响烷烃转化的机理和效率：

1. 催化剂组成：研究了Mo/HZSM-5和Mo-W/HZSM-5催化剂。向钼基催化剂中添加钨似乎可以提高其性能。

2. 催化剂结构：金属物种（Mo和W）高度分散在沸石通道中，这可能有助于其催化活性。

3. 反应条件：
   - 温度：纯甲烷转化需要高温（973 K），而天然气可以在较低温度下转化（773-873 K）。
   - 进料组成：天然气中C2+添加剂的存在允许在较低温度下进行转化，相比纯甲烷。
   - 催化剂状态：部分积碳的催化剂可以在较低温度（873 K）下转化纯甲烷，相比新鲜催化剂。

4. 机理：C2+烃或催化剂表面的焦炭的存在似乎能够启动转化过程，允许在较低温度下进行反应。

5. 效率：在较低温度（773 K）下使用天然气进料可以达到10-20%的转化率，这对潜在的工业应用具有重要意义。

这些因素通过潜在地允许较低的操作温度来促进这些催化剂的工业重要性，这可能导致烷烃转化过程中的能源节约和改善的工艺经济性。
