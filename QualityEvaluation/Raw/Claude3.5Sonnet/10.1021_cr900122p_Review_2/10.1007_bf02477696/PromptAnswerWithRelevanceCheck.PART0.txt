[1] "Mo/HZSM-5 catalyst was prepared as described previously [1]. Mo-W/HZSM-5 was prepared by impregnating NH4ZSM-5 with aqueous solution of ammonium heptamolybdate and ammonium tungstate mixed from ttmgstic acid and aqueous ammonia."

[2] "The XRD, FT-IR and surface area results showed that Mo species are highly dispersed in the channels of the zeolite. The same seemed to occttr for MoW-ZSM-5 catalyst."

[3] "Pure methane can also be converted to aromatics over partially coked Mo/HZSM-5 and Mo-W/HZSM-5 catalysts at 873 K as can be seen in Table 2."

[4] "Therefore, only some special coke formed under certain coking conditions may be converted to aromatics with pure methane at a temperature as low as 873 K."

</quotes>

<EnglishVersionAnswer>

The literature provides some insights into how metal-based catalysts influence alkane transformations, particularly for methane conversion to aromatics:

1. Catalyst composition and structure: Mo/HZSM-5 and Mo-W/HZSM-5 catalysts are discussed. The metal species (Mo and W) are highly dispersed in the zeolite channels, which likely contributes to their catalytic activity.

2. Reaction conditions: Lower temperatures (773-873 K) are explored for methane conversion, which is significant as it could potentially make the process more industrially viable compared to higher temperature reactions.

3. Catalyst state: Partially coked catalysts show activity for pure methane conversion at lower temperatures (873 K) compared to fresh catalysts, suggesting that coke formation plays a role in the reaction mechanism.

4. Mechanism: The presence of C2+ hydrocarbons or specific types of coke on the catalyst surface appears to initiate methane conversion, possibly by forming reactive intermediates.

5. Industrial significance: The ability to convert methane at lower temperatures (773-873 K) could potentially make these processes more energy-efficient and economically viable for industrial applications.

However, the document does not provide detailed information on oxidative dehydrogenation or a comprehensive comparison of different metal-based catalysts. The focus is primarily on Mo and Mo-W based zeolite catalysts for methane aromatization.

该文献提供了一些关于金属基催化剂如何影响烷烃转化的见解，特别是甲烷转化为芳烃的过程：

1. 催化剂组成和结构：文中讨论了Mo/HZSM-5和Mo-W/HZSM-5催化剂。金属物种（Mo和W）高度分散在沸石通道中，这可能有助于其催化活性。

2. 反应条件：探索了较低温度（773-873 K）下的甲烷转化，这一点很重要，因为它可能使该过程相比高温反应在工业上更加可行。

3. 催化剂状态：部分积碳的催化剂在较低温度（873 K）下对纯甲烷转化表现出活性，而新鲜催化剂则不然，这表明积碳形成在反应机理中起着作用。

4. 机理：催化剂表面上C2+烃类或特定类型积碳的存在似乎能够启动甲烷转化，可能是通过形成活性中间体。

5. 工业意义：在较低温度（773-873 K）下转化甲烷的能力可能使这些过程在工业应用中更加节能和经济可行。

然而，该文档并未提供关于氧化脱氢的详细信息，也没有对不同金属基催化剂进行全面比较。文章主要关注Mo和Mo-W基沸石催化剂用于甲烷芳构化的研究。

[1] "Conversion of pure methane and natural gas with different methane purity to aromatic hydrocarbons at 773 and 873 K have been investigated."

[2] "Conversion of methane to aromatics under non-oxidizing conditions can be initiated by higher hydrocarbon mixtures in the feed and, some special coke deposited on Mo/HZSM-5 catalyst at lower reaction temperature."

[3] "Mo/HZSM-5 catalyst was prepared as described previously [1]. Mo-W/HZSM-5 was prepared by impregnating NH4ZSM-5 with aqueous solution of ammonium heptamolybdate and ammonium tungstate mixed from ttmgstic acid and aqueous ammonia."

[4] "Results of the reaction of pure methane and natural gas (methane with some C2+ additive) over Mo/HZSM-5 catalyst are summarized in Table 2. It is shown that pure methane only can be converted to aromatics at 973 K [1]. However, the case is very different when we used natural gas as feed. Natural gas, methane with C2+ additives at different methane purity, can even be converted to aromatics at the low temperature of 773 K and about 10-20% is obtained."

The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations. Specifically for methane conversion to aromatics:

1. Catalyst composition: Mo/HZSM-5 and Mo-W/HZSM-5 catalysts are effective for methane aromatization. The addition of tungsten to the molybdenum-based catalyst may enhance its performance.

2. Catalyst structure: The catalysts are prepared by impregnating zeolites (HZSM-5 or NH4ZSM-5) with metal precursors, resulting in highly dispersed metal species within the zeolite channels.

3. Reaction conditions: Temperature plays a crucial role. Pure methane can only be converted to aromatics at 973 K, while natural gas (methane with C2+ additives) can be converted at much lower temperatures (773-873 K).

4. Feed composition: The presence of higher hydrocarbons (C2+ additives) in the feed significantly lowers the reaction temperature required for methane conversion.

5. Catalyst pretreatment: Partially coked Mo-containing ZSM-5 catalysts can initiate methane conversion at lower temperatures (873 K) compared to fresh catalysts.

These factors contribute to the industrial significance of the process by potentially allowing methane conversion to valuable aromatic products at lower temperatures, which could lead to energy savings and improved process economics. The ability to use natural gas directly as a feedstock also enhances the industrial relevance of this catalytic system.

金属基催化剂的组成、结构和反应条件显著影响烷烃转化的机理和效率。具体到甲烷转化为芳烃：

1. 催化剂组成：Mo/HZSM-5和Mo-W/HZSM-5催化剂对甲烷芳构化有效。向钼基催化剂中添加钨可能会增强其性能。

2. 催化剂结构：催化剂通过将金属前体浸渍到沸石（HZSM-5或NH4ZSM-5）中制备，使金属物种高度分散在沸石通道中。

3. 反应条件：温度起着关键作用。纯甲烷只能在973 K下转化为芳烃，而天然气（含C2+添加剂的甲烷）可以在更低的温度（773-873 K）下转化。

4. 进料组成：进料中存在高级碳氢化合物（C2+添加剂）显著降低了甲烷转化所需的反应温度。

5. 催化剂预处理：与新鲜催化剂相比，部分结焦的含钼ZSM-5催化剂可以在较低温度（873 K）下启动甲烷转化。

这些因素通过潜在地允许在较低温度下将甲烷转化为有价值的芳烃产品，从而提高了该过程的工业意义，这可能导致节能和改善过程经济性。直接使用天然气作为原料的能力也增强了该催化系统的工业相关性。

The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations, particularly in zeolite-catalyzed reactions. The study focuses on Mo/HZSM-5 and Mo-W/HZSM-5 catalysts for methane conversion to aromatic hydrocarbons.

The composition of these catalysts involves Mo species highly dispersed in the zeolite channels, as evidenced by XRD, FT-IR, and surface area measurements. For Mo-W/HZSM-5, tungsten is added to the catalyst composition.

Structure-wise, the catalysts are based on HZSM-5 zeolite, which provides the necessary framework for the reactions. The metal species (Mo and W) are dispersed within this structure, creating active sites for methane activation.

Reaction conditions play a crucial role in the efficiency of the process. The study investigates temperatures of 773 K and 873 K, which are lower than typical methane conversion temperatures. The presence of higher hydrocarbon mixtures in the feed or special coke deposited on the catalyst surface enables methane conversion at these lower temperatures.

The efficiency of the process is influenced by these factors. Pure methane can be converted to aromatics over partially coked Mo/HZSM-5 and Mo-W/HZSM-5 catalysts at 873 K, which is a significant improvement over higher temperature processes.

These factors contribute to the industrial significance of the process by potentially lowering energy requirements and improving the overall efficiency of methane conversion to more valuable aromatic hydrocarbons. The ability to use natural gas (which contains higher hydrocarbons) as a feedstock also enhances the industrial applicability of this process.

金属基催化剂的组成、结构和反应条件对烷烃转化的机理和效率有显著影响，特别是在沸石催化反应中。本研究重点关注Mo/HZSM-5和Mo-W/HZSM-5催化剂用于甲烷转化为芳烃的过程。

这些催化剂的组成涉及高度分散在沸石孔道中的Mo物种，这一点通过XRD、FT-IR和表面积测量得到证实。对于Mo-W/HZSM-5，还在催化剂组成中添加了钨。

结构方面，这些催化剂基于HZSM-5沸石，为反应提供了必要的骨架。金属物种（Mo和W）分散在这个结构中，创造了甲烷活化的活性位点。

反应条件对过程效率起着关键作用。该研究考察了773 K和873 K的温度，这比典型的甲烷转化温度要低。进料中存在高级烃混合物或催化剂表面沉积的特殊焦炭，使得在这些较低温度下能够进行甲烷转化。

过程的效率受到这些因素的影响。纯甲烷可以在873 K下通过部分结焦的Mo/HZSM-5和Mo-W/HZSM-5催化剂转化为芳烃，这比高温过程有显著改进。

这些因素通过潜在降低能源需求和提高甲烷转化为更有价值的芳烃的整体效率，为该过程的工业重要性做出贡献。使用天然气（含有高级烃）作为原料的能力也增强了这一过程的工业应用性。
