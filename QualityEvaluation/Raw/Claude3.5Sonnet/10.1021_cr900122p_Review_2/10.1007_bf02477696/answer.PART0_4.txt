[1] "Mo/HZSM-5 catalyst was prepared as described previously [1]. Mo-W/HZSM-5 was prepared by impregnating NH4ZSM-5 with aqueous solution of ammonium heptamolybdate and ammonium tungstate mixed from ttmgstic acid and aqueous ammonia."

[2] "Results of the reaction of pure methane and natural gas (methane with some C2+ additive) over Mo/HZSM-5 catalyst are summarized in Table 2. It is shown that pure methane only can be converted to aromatics at 973 K [1]. However, the case is very different when we used natural gas as feed."

[3] "Natural gas, methane with C2+ additives at different methane purity, can even be converted to aromatics at the low temperature of 773 K and about 10-20% is obtained."

[4] "Pure methane can also be converted to aromatics over partially coked Mo/HZSM-5 and Mo-W/HZSM-5 catalysts at 873 K as can be seen in Table 2."

The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations:

1. Catalyst composition: Mo/HZSM-5 and Mo-W/HZSM-5 catalysts were used, with Mo and W acting as active metal components supported on HZSM-5 zeolite.

2. Catalyst structure: The metals are highly dispersed in the zeolite channels, as indicated by XRD, FT-IR, and surface area measurements.

3. Reaction conditions: Temperature plays a crucial role. Pure methane could only be converted to aromatics at 973 K, while natural gas (methane with C2+ additives) could be converted at lower temperatures (773-873 K).

4. Catalyst state: Partially coked catalysts showed activity for pure methane conversion at lower temperatures (873 K) compared to fresh catalysts.

5. Feed composition: The presence of C2+ additives in natural gas enabled methane conversion at lower temperatures and higher efficiencies compared to pure methane.

These factors contribute to industrial significance by allowing for:
- Lower operating temperatures (773-873 K vs 973 K)
- Improved methane conversion (10-20% at lower temperatures)
- Flexibility in feedstock (pure methane vs natural gas)
- Potential energy savings and increased process efficiency

The study demonstrates that modifying catalyst composition, pretreatment (coking), and feed composition can significantly enhance the efficiency of alkane transformations, particularly in zeolite-catalyzed reactions for methane aromatization.

金属基催化剂的成分、结构和反应条件对烷烃转化的机理和效率有显著影响：

1. 催化剂成分：使用了Mo/HZSM-5和Mo-W/HZSM-5催化剂，Mo和W作为活性金属成分负载在HZSM-5分子筛上。

2. 催化剂结构：根据XRD、FT-IR和表面积测量结果，金属高度分散在分子筛孔道中。

3. 反应条件：温度起关键作用。纯甲烷只能在973 K下转化为芳烃，而天然气（含C2+添加剂的甲烷）可在较低温度（773-873 K）下转化。

4. 催化剂状态：部分积碳的催化剂在较低温度（873 K）下对纯甲烷转化表现出活性，而新鲜催化剂则不行。

5. 进料组成：天然气中C2+添加剂的存在使得甲烷能在较低温度下转化，并且转化效率更高。

这些因素通过以下方式提高了工业重要性：
- 降低操作温度（773-873 K vs 973 K）
- 提高甲烷转化率（在较低温度下达到10-20%）
- 提高原料灵活性（纯甲烷 vs 天然气）
- 潜在的能源节省和过程效率提高

该研究表明，通过修改催化剂成分、预处理（积碳）和进料组成，可以显著提高烷烃转化的效率，特别是在分子筛催化的甲烷芳构化反应中。
