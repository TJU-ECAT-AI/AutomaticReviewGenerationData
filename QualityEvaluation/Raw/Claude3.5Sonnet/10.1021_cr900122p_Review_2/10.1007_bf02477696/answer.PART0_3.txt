The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations, particularly in zeolite-catalyzed reactions. The study focuses on Mo/HZSM-5 and Mo-W/HZSM-5 catalysts for methane conversion to aromatic hydrocarbons.

The composition of these catalysts involves Mo species highly dispersed in the zeolite channels, as evidenced by XRD, FT-IR, and surface area measurements. For Mo-W/HZSM-5, tungsten is added to the catalyst composition.

Structure-wise, the catalysts are based on HZSM-5 zeolite, which provides the necessary framework for the reactions. The metal species (Mo and W) are dispersed within this structure, creating active sites for methane activation.

Reaction conditions play a crucial role in the efficiency of the process. The study investigates temperatures of 773 K and 873 K, which are lower than typical methane conversion temperatures. The presence of higher hydrocarbon mixtures in the feed or special coke deposited on the catalyst surface enables methane conversion at these lower temperatures.

The efficiency of the process is influenced by these factors. Pure methane can be converted to aromatics over partially coked Mo/HZSM-5 and Mo-W/HZSM-5 catalysts at 873 K, which is a significant improvement over higher temperature processes.

These factors contribute to the industrial significance of the process by potentially lowering energy requirements and improving the overall efficiency of methane conversion to more valuable aromatic hydrocarbons. The ability to use natural gas (which contains higher hydrocarbons) as a feedstock also enhances the industrial applicability of this process.

金属基催化剂的组成、结构和反应条件对烷烃转化的机理和效率有显著影响，特别是在沸石催化反应中。本研究重点关注Mo/HZSM-5和Mo-W/HZSM-5催化剂用于甲烷转化为芳烃的过程。

这些催化剂的组成涉及高度分散在沸石孔道中的Mo物种，这一点通过XRD、FT-IR和表面积测量得到证实。对于Mo-W/HZSM-5，还在催化剂组成中添加了钨。

结构方面，这些催化剂基于HZSM-5沸石，为反应提供了必要的骨架。金属物种（Mo和W）分散在这个结构中，创造了甲烷活化的活性位点。

反应条件对过程效率起着关键作用。该研究考察了773 K和873 K的温度，这比典型的甲烷转化温度要低。进料中存在高级烃混合物或催化剂表面沉积的特殊焦炭，使得在这些较低温度下能够进行甲烷转化。

过程的效率受到这些因素的影响。纯甲烷可以在873 K下通过部分结焦的Mo/HZSM-5和Mo-W/HZSM-5催化剂转化为芳烃，这比高温过程有显著改进。

这些因素通过潜在降低能源需求和提高甲烷转化为更有价值的芳烃的整体效率，为该过程的工业重要性做出贡献。使用天然气（含有高级烃）作为原料的能力也增强了这一过程的工业应用性。
