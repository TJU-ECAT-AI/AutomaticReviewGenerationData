[1] "Conversion of pure methane and natural gas with different methane purity to aromatic hydrocarbons at 773 and 873 K have been investigated."

[2] "Conversion of methane to aromatics under non-oxidizing conditions can be initiated by higher hydrocarbon mixtures in the feed and, some special coke deposited on Mo/HZSM-5 catalyst at lower reaction temperature."

[3] "Mo/HZSM-5 catalyst was prepared as described previously [1]. Mo-W/HZSM-5 was prepared by impregnating NH4ZSM-5 with aqueous solution of ammonium heptamolybdate and ammonium tungstate mixed from ttmgstic acid and aqueous ammonia."

[4] "Results of the reaction of pure methane and natural gas (methane with some C2+ additive) over Mo/HZSM-5 catalyst are summarized in Table 2. It is shown that pure methane only can be converted to aromatics at 973 K [1]. However, the case is very different when we used natural gas as feed. Natural gas, methane with C2+ additives at different methane purity, can even be converted to aromatics at the low temperature of 773 K and about 10-20% is obtained."

The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations. Specifically for methane conversion to aromatics:

1. Catalyst composition: Mo/HZSM-5 and Mo-W/HZSM-5 catalysts are effective for methane aromatization. The addition of tungsten to the molybdenum-based catalyst may enhance its performance.

2. Catalyst structure: The catalysts are prepared by impregnating zeolites (HZSM-5 or NH4ZSM-5) with metal precursors, resulting in highly dispersed metal species within the zeolite channels.

3. Reaction conditions: Temperature plays a crucial role. Pure methane can only be converted to aromatics at 973 K, while natural gas (methane with C2+ additives) can be converted at much lower temperatures (773-873 K).

4. Feed composition: The presence of higher hydrocarbons (C2+ additives) in the feed significantly lowers the reaction temperature required for methane conversion.

5. Catalyst pretreatment: Partially coked Mo-containing ZSM-5 catalysts can initiate methane conversion at lower temperatures (873 K) compared to fresh catalysts.

These factors contribute to the industrial significance of the process by potentially allowing methane conversion to valuable aromatic products at lower temperatures, which could lead to energy savings and improved process economics. The ability to use natural gas directly as a feedstock also enhances the industrial relevance of this catalytic system.

金属基催化剂的组成、结构和反应条件显著影响烷烃转化的机理和效率。具体到甲烷转化为芳烃：

1. 催化剂组成：Mo/HZSM-5和Mo-W/HZSM-5催化剂对甲烷芳构化有效。向钼基催化剂中添加钨可能会增强其性能。

2. 催化剂结构：催化剂通过将金属前体浸渍到沸石（HZSM-5或NH4ZSM-5）中制备，使金属物种高度分散在沸石通道中。

3. 反应条件：温度起着关键作用。纯甲烷只能在973 K下转化为芳烃，而天然气（含C2+添加剂的甲烷）可以在更低的温度（773-873 K）下转化。

4. 进料组成：进料中存在高级碳氢化合物（C2+添加剂）显著降低了甲烷转化所需的反应温度。

5. 催化剂预处理：与新鲜催化剂相比，部分结焦的含钼ZSM-5催化剂可以在较低温度（873 K）下启动甲烷转化。

这些因素通过潜在地允许在较低温度下将甲烷转化为有价值的芳烃产品，从而提高了该过程的工业意义，这可能导致节能和改善过程经济性。直接使用天然气作为原料的能力也增强了该催化系统的工业相关性。
