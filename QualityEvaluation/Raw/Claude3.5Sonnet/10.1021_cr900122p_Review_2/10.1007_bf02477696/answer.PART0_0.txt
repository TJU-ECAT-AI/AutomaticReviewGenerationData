[1] "Mo/HZSM-5 catalyst was prepared as described previously [1]. Mo-W/HZSM-5 was prepared by impregnating NH4ZSM-5 with aqueous solution of ammonium heptamolybdate and ammonium tungstate mixed from ttmgstic acid and aqueous ammonia."

[2] "The XRD, FT-IR and surface area results showed that Mo species are highly dispersed in the channels of the zeolite. The same seemed to occttr for MoW-ZSM-5 catalyst."

[3] "Pure methane can also be converted to aromatics over partially coked Mo/HZSM-5 and Mo-W/HZSM-5 catalysts at 873 K as can be seen in Table 2."

[4] "Therefore, only some special coke formed under certain coking conditions may be converted to aromatics with pure methane at a temperature as low as 873 K."

The literature provides some insights into how metal-based catalysts influence alkane transformations, particularly for methane conversion to aromatics:

1. Catalyst composition and structure: Mo/HZSM-5 and Mo-W/HZSM-5 catalysts are discussed. The metal species (Mo and W) are highly dispersed in the zeolite channels, which likely contributes to their catalytic activity.

2. Reaction conditions: Lower temperatures (773-873 K) are explored for methane conversion, which is significant as it could potentially make the process more industrially viable compared to higher temperature reactions.

3. Catalyst state: Partially coked catalysts show activity for pure methane conversion at lower temperatures (873 K) compared to fresh catalysts, suggesting that coke formation plays a role in the reaction mechanism.

4. Mechanism: The presence of C2+ hydrocarbons or specific types of coke on the catalyst surface appears to initiate methane conversion, possibly by forming reactive intermediates.

5. Industrial significance: The ability to convert methane at lower temperatures (773-873 K) could potentially make these processes more energy-efficient and economically viable for industrial applications.

However, the document does not provide detailed information on oxidative dehydrogenation or a comprehensive comparison of different metal-based catalysts. The focus is primarily on Mo and Mo-W based zeolite catalysts for methane aromatization.

该文献提供了一些关于金属基催化剂如何影响烷烃转化的见解，特别是甲烷转化为芳烃的过程：

1. 催化剂组成和结构：文中讨论了Mo/HZSM-5和Mo-W/HZSM-5催化剂。金属物种（Mo和W）高度分散在沸石通道中，这可能有助于其催化活性。

2. 反应条件：探索了较低温度（773-873 K）下的甲烷转化，这一点很重要，因为它可能使该过程相比高温反应在工业上更加可行。

3. 催化剂状态：部分积碳的催化剂在较低温度（873 K）下对纯甲烷转化表现出活性，而新鲜催化剂则不然，这表明积碳形成在反应机理中起着作用。

4. 机理：催化剂表面上C2+烃类或特定类型积碳的存在似乎能够启动甲烷转化，可能是通过形成活性中间体。

5. 工业意义：在较低温度（773-873 K）下转化甲烷的能力可能使这些过程在工业应用中更加节能和经济可行。

然而，该文档并未提供关于氧化脱氢的详细信息，也没有对不同金属基催化剂进行全面比较。文章主要关注Mo和Mo-W基沸石催化剂用于甲烷芳构化的研究。
