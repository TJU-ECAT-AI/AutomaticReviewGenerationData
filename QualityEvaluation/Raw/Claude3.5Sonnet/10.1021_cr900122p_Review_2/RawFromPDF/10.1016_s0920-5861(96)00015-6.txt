Abstract 
The aromatisation of propane was investigated at 823 K on two Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts differing by their aluminum 
content (Si/A1 = 18 and 128, respectively), i.e. their Br~Snsted acid site concentration, and having similar gallium content 
(1.6 wt%) as a function of successive pretreatments by hydrogen and oxygen. Hydrogen treatment increases activity and 
selectivity to aromatics while decreasing the formation of methane. Subsequent oxygen treatment enhances further the 
activity and aromatics selectivity and has little effect on methane selectivity. These improvements of catalytic performance 
are explained by gallium migration in reducing conditions. The concentration of highly dispersed gallium species is thereby 
enhanced. These species, in association with BrCnsted centers, were reported previously to constitute the dual catalytic sites 
responsible for alkane activation. Hydrogen-oxygen pretreatment of Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts is thus a means to ensure rapid 
catalyst preactivation and stabilisation in large scale light alkane aromatisation units.

1. Introduction 
Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts are most active and 
selective for the aromatisation of propane [1]. It 
is widely accepted that their activity and selec- 
tivity result from their bifunctional properties, 
whereby gallium species are responsible for their 
dehydrogenation-hydrogenation 
activity and the 
Bffinsted acid sites of the zeolite provide the 
centres necessary for chain growth. 
Recently, it was shown that dual active sites 
are responsible for the activation of propane on

Ga/H-ZSM-5 [2-4]. These dual active sites 
consist of highly dispersed (Ga 
3+, 0 2-) ions 
pairs, acting in synergy with neighbouring 
BfiSnsted sites which initially activate propane 
as a protonated pseudo-cyclopropane species. 
Changes in the propane aromatisation activity 
and selectivity of these catalysts as a function of 
the number of reaction (reducing conditions)- 
regeneration (oxidative conditions) cycles sus- 
tained were explained by the migration of gal- 
lium species in and out of the zeolite intracrys- 
talline void space [5] as substantiated by de- 
tailed catalyst characterisation [6]. 
Several authors, including us, proposed that 
gallium is reduced under reaction conditions 
and that its migration involves Ga(I) species

ZSM-5 catalysts [25]. A possible explanation is 
that the limiting step of the propane dehydro- 
genation is the removal of hydrogen [26]. An- 
other is that competitive adsorption of hydrogen 
inhibits the formation of the protonated 
pseudo-cyclopropane intermediate responsible 
for the initial activation of propane [1,2]. 
The present contribution aims at clarifying 
the role of reductive (hydrogen) and oxidative 
(oxygen) atmospheres in the activation of 
Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts for propane aromatisa- 
tion. 
[1,2,7-18]. Migration of Ga20 species via the 
vapour phase was postulated by us but solid 
state ion-exchange [19] was not ruled out as 
another possibility [1,2,5,6]. A debate was also 
initiated recently about the possible and re- 
versible formation of a catalytically active site 
at the interface between Ga203 and zeolite H- 
ZSM-5, with no induction period, when a me- 
chanical mixture of these two solids is exposed 
to reaction conditions [20-23]. The appearance 
of such new active sites could be related to the 
rapid reduction of some Ga(III) by hydrogen 
released as aromatisation is initiated. 
Several authors have also reported the in- 
hibitory effect of hydrogen on propane transfor- 
mation over Zn/H-ZSM-5 [24] and Ga/H-

the present study have been described previ-

Chemical and physical distributions of A1 
and Ga species were derived as described else-

and 295i MAS NMR results with NH3-TPD data 
for the fresh and used catalysts exchanged with 
ammonium ions at pH = 9, in order to measure

to the aluminium species in the zeolite frame- 
work [27]. 
Table 1 summarises the main characteristics 
of the two catalysts. 
2.2. Catalyst testing 
Catalytic performances were evaluated at 823 
K (P= 1 bar; pure feed=C3H8). Catalytic 
testing and product analyses were performed as 
described earlier [2,5,6]. Hydrogen-oxygen pre- 
treatments were performed at 823 K (1 h in H 2 
and 1 h in 0 2, P = 1 atm, 2.0 1 h-l). Activity 
and selectivity for the conversion of propane 
following H2-O 2 pretreatments were measured 
after 2 min time-on-stream at 823 K. 
3. Results and discussion 
The catalytic performances of both catalysts 
exposed from none to six H2-O 2 cycles are 
shown in Tables 2-4 and Fig. 1.

Fig. 1. Effect of H 2 
-02 treatment cycles on (a) the conversion of 
propane and (b) the product selectivities in the aromatisation 
reaction (T= 823 K, P = 1 bar, propane flow rate = 2.0 1 h -1 ) 
using Z234 SL2 (catalyst weight= 12.4 mg) and Z356 SL1 
(catalyst weight = 26.0 mg) catalysts. 
The conversion of propane and the aromatisa- 
tion selectivity increase significantly when the 
catalysts are exposed to H 2 pretreatment: after 
the first H 2 exposure, activity increases by 15% 
for Z234 SL2 and 200% for Z356 SL1. The first 
02 treatment also increases catalyst activity and 
aromatisation selectivity: activity increases by 
30% for Z234 SL2 and 100% for Z356 SL1. 
Interestingly, the selectivity to methane is de- 
creased by the first H 2 treatment but not by the 
first 02 treatment whereas both the first H 2 and 
02 treatments increase aromatisation selectivity. 
Subsequent H 2 and 02 treatments have only a 
marginal effect on catalyst activity and selectiv- 
ity. 
These observations are consistent with the 
previously observed migration of gallium 
species under reducing atmosphere. Thermody- 
namics indicates that in the presence of hydro- 
gen (P = 1 bar) at 823 K, Ga203 is reduced to 
Ga20 with an equilibrium vapour pressure of 
Ga20 equal to 2.38 × 10 -8 bar [2,3] and sev- 
eral data confirm that the gallium deposited/ 
ion-exchanged on the zeolite catalysts reduces 
from Ga(III) to Ga(I) [2,6-8]. The vapour phase 
GaaO species are highly mobile [2,3,5,10] but 
migration of Ga(I) species through the vapour 
phase does not exclude the migration/disper- 
sion via other mechanisms such as solid-state 
ion-exchange [19]. Ga20 species may be con- 
vened to Ga + ions by reaction with the BrSnsted 
acid sites of the zeolite, leading to highly dis- 
persed gallium species that are further oxidised 
by treatment in oxygen to yield highly dispersed 
Ga 
3+ entities. 
These physical and chemical transformations 
of gallium species are responsible for the activ- 
ity-selectivity changes in the initial reaction- 
regeneration cycles of propane aromatisation at 
823 K [2,3,5,6] and agree with the proposals of 
several authors [10,11,13,14]. In particular, 
Meriaudeau et al. [28,29] showed that the 
BrSnsted sites concentration was reduced and 
that Lewis acid sites were generated after hy- 
drogen treatments, which is consistent with the 
probable ion-exchange of BriSnsted sites by Ga 
ions and the Lewis acid site nature of highly 
dispersed Ga 
3÷ species. In agreement with 
Meriaudeau, we also reported earlier that Z234 
SL2, after three reaction-regeneration cycles, 
had lost part of its potential BrSnsted acidity 
and contained more Lewis acid species [6]. 
The effect of H 2 exposure is summarised 
hereabove. The subsequent effect of oxygen has 
received less attention in the past. One possibil-

carbonaceous residues when applied to a coked 
catalyst. This process increases the catalysts 
acidity in addition to dispersing the gallium 
modifier and could explain the further increase 
of activity and selectivity to aromatics when 0 2 
treatment follows H a treatment. Other possible 
transformations of the various gallium species 
in the presence of 0 2 and traces of water are 
schematised in Fig. 2. 
Thus, two major modifications may occur 
during 0 2 treatment, which can increase activity 
and aromatics selectivity: 
The oxidation state of gallium species is 
restored to 3 +. 
The presence or the production (by coke 
burning) of steam causes partial degalliation 
of the framework and increase the concentra- 
tion of dispersed gallium species. 
Subsequent H2-O 2 treatments do not cause 
any major increase in activity or variation in 
methane and aromatics selectivities. Thus, the 
role of such treatments after the first cycle 
would only be to maintain the dispersion, chem- 
ical state, and number of dispersed Ga D species 
inside the zeolite. 
As seen from Fig. 1 and Tables 2 and 3, the 
improvement in activity is much more drastic 
for Z356 SL1 than for Z234 SL2 after the first 
H2-O 2 treatment. Z356 SL1 is the catalyst 
which has initially the lowest Ga dispersion, 
probably because of its lower A1 content [2,3,6]. 
The enhancement in catalytic performance is 
mostly due to Ga redispersion as evidenced by 
RBS data. For both catalysts, subsequent H2-O 2 
treatments lead to oscillations of activity at 
almost constant level, sligthly higher after 0 2 
treatment than after H 2 treatment. The latter 
observation is tentatively explained by consider- 
ing that Ga(III) is more efficient than Ga(I) to 
activate C3H 8 by heterolytic abstraction of H 2 
species as (a) it is more easily reduced to a 
lower oxidation state, and (b) as it is a stronger 
Lewis acid than Ga(I). 
Table 4 shows the effect of H2-O 2 pretreat- 
ments on the balance between the cracking and 
dehydrogenating functions, illustrated by the se- 
lectivities to methane, propene, and aromatics 
and the C2=/C 2 and H/C ratio of the prod- 
ucts. 
The high initial CH 4 selectivity decreases 
upon successive treatments with hydrogen and 
oxygen. It is higher for catalyst Z356 SL1, in 
which about 70% of the gallium is initially 
non-dispersed and agglomerated at the external 
surface of the zeolite crystallites (compared to 
only 14% for Z234 SL2) [6], although Z356 
SL1, contains about 2.6 times less acidic sites 
than Z234 SL2 (Table 1). Reoxidation of the 
catalysts by oxygen, following the hydrogen 
treatment, increases only slightly the CH 4 selec- 
tivity as shown over several successive H2-O 2 
cycles. Both catalysts have nearly the same 
methane selectivity after the first H2-O 2 treat- 
ment. 
Three factors may increase the selectivity to 
methane: 
• Increasing acidity which favours cracking. 
332 
S.B. Abdul Hamid et al. / Catalysis Today 31 (1996) 327-334 
• Higher aromatics yield which leads to higher 
hydrogen production. The latter can released 
as methane and ethane (via acid-catalysed 
hydrogen transfer processes), or as molecular 
hydrogen on Ga species acting as portholes 
[17,18,26]. 
• The absence of an efficient route for the 
release of molecular hydrogen, namely if Ga 
species do not act efficiently as portholes to 
recombine hydrogen adatoms [17,18,26], i.e. 
as entities enabling the reverse spillover of 
hydrogen [31-33]. 
The data shown in Tables 2 and 3 show 
clearly that exposure to 0 2 following the first 
H 2 treatment does not increase the methane and 
ethane selectivities although a significant in- 
crease in aromatics selectivity is observed. Hy- 
drogen released by this higher aromatics selec- 
tivity is thus not transferred to C 1 and C 2 
products which have a higher H/C ratio than 
propane. This point is confirmed by the average 
lower H/C ratio of the whole hydrocarbon 
products. Hence, desorption of dihydrogen must 
have been enhanced. We conclude that the dis- 
persion of gallium resulting from the initial 
H2-O 2 cycle generates Ga species which pro- 
vide a porthole for efficient H 2 release via 
reverse hydrogen spillover as mentioned here- 
above. We also conclude that the most active 
Ga species are in the oxidation state 3 + and 
that dehydrogenation processes and H-adatom 
recombination most probably involves the 
Ga(III)/Ga(I) redox couple. The latter supports 
earlier observations and proposals by other au- 
thors. 
The C2=/C 2 ratio varies in the same way as 
the change in CH 4 selectivity. A variation of 
the C2=/C 2 ratio results from the combination 
of two factors: a decrease (or increase) of the 
selectivity to ethene and the opposite increase 
(or decrease) of the selectivity to ethane. It has 
been proposed that the C2=/C 2 ratio measures 
the catalyst ability to transfer hydrogen [30]. 
The decrease of the C2=/C 2 ratio for the 
Z234 SL2 catalyst could indicate a more effi- 
cient hydrogen transfer reaction in the presence 
of dispersed Ga species providing a dehydro- 
genation-hydrogenation function, where part of 
the ethene formed is being converted to ethane. 
However, it was observed that the decrease in 
ethene selectivity is very much in excess when 
compared to the increase in ethane selectivity 
(Table 2). Hence, the C2=/C 2 ratio must be 
influenced by an additional (acid-catalysed) re- 
action pathway that consumes ethene, such as 
the formation of aromatics by conjunct poly- 
merisation of ethene with other olefins. This 
proposal is supported by the fact that the in- 
crease in aromatics selectivity is almost quanti- 
tatively the sum of the decrease in ethene, 
propene, and butene selectivities and by the 
small variation of the C2=/C 2 ratio for the 
Z356 SL1 catalyst which has a much lower 
concentration of acid sites. 
The aromatisation selectivity, in both cases, 
increases during the first H2-O 2 cycle to a 
relatively constant value of ca. 30% (slightly 
higher for Z234 SL2 compared to Z356 SL1). 
As expected, a higher selectivity to propene is 
observed for Z356 SL1 which is less acidic. 
The average H/C ratio of the products de- 
creases with increasing number of H 2 and 0 2 
cycles. Values are lower for Z234 SL2 com- 
pared to Z356 SL1, indicating the higher dehy- 
drogenation and aromatisation activity of the 
former. 
The evolution of the aromatisation selectivity 
and average H/C ratio are consistent with the 
view that (i) dispersed gallium species (more 
abundant in Z234 SL2) combined with BriSnsted 
sites favour propane activation and aromatisa- 
tion whereas non-dispersed Ga species, e.g. 
Ga203, at the outer surface of the crystallites is 
mostly a dehydrogenation component, and (ii) 
the need for carbon chain growth via acid-cata- 
lysed processes (oligomerisation, cracking and 
equilibration of olefins) in propane aromatisa- 
tion. 
Our results confirm earlier findings that H E 
pretreatment favours the formation of dispersed 
Ga species which possess dehydrogenation and 
hydrogen release properties.

The new observations are that activity and 
aromatics selectivity are further increased upon 
oxygen treatment whereas methane selectivity 
remains unchanged, and that only the first H 2- 
0 2 treatment affects dramatically the catalysts 
performance. 
H2-O 2 pretreatment thus appear to be a 
promising way to preactivate and stabilise Ga- 
modified aromatisation catalysts in commercial 
operation. 
4. Conclusions 
We have studied the effect of H2-O 2 pre- 
treatment on the catalytic performance of 
Ga/H-ZSM-5 
catalysts used to aromatise 
propane. 
Successive H2-O 2 pretreatments at 823 K 
affect dramatically the catalytic performance, 
the major effect being observed for the first 
H2-O 2 cycle. The first treatment in hydrogen 
increases activity and aromatics selectivity, and 
reduces methane formation. The subsequent first 
treatment in oxygen does not affect methane 
selectivity but boosts further activity and aro- 
matics selectivity. 
The effect of hydrogen is clearly to increase 
the dispersion of the gallium modifier, thereby 
generating more dual active sites combining 
intimately gallium species [(Ga 
3+, 0 2-) ion 
pairs) and Br/3nsted sites from the zeolite, en- 
hancing overall catalytic performance, and dis- 
persed gallium species acting as portholes to 
release dihydrogen, thus reducing methane pro- 
duction. The effect of oxygen may be to sta- 
bilise and anchor these highly dispersed gallium 
species, in addition to reoxidising them to the 
3 + oxidation state which appears to be respon- 
sible for their optimum activity. The latter im- 
plies that gallium species cycle between the 
Ga(III) and Ga(I) states under these reaction 
conditions. 
Pretreating Ga/H-ZSM-5 zeolites firstly in 
hydrogen and secondly in oxygen at about 800- 
850 K appears as a promising and convenient 
way to preactivate and stabilise them as cata- 
lysts prior to their use in aromatisation units. 
The induction period observed in the absence of 
such pretreatment is eliminated.
