A theoretical study of the mechanism of ethane dehydrogenation catalysed by Zn-doped zeolites was
undertaken. The catalyst was modelled by the ring cluster
coordinated with the Zn2` ion.
[Al2Si2O4H8]2~
The results obtained indicate that the reaction proceeds via a mechanism starting from the ““alkylÏÏ rupture of
the ethane CÈH bond
and the zinc cation acts as an acceptor of the alkyl group. The catalytic
(C2H5d~ÈHd`),
cycle for the ““alkylÏÏ activation consists of three elementary steps: (i) rupture of ethane CÈH bond on the
Znd`ÈOd~ pair; (ii) formation of ethene from the alkyl group bound to Zn; and (iii) formation of dihydrogen
from the
proton and hydrogen bound to Zn. The computed activation energies for these three steps
BrÔnsted
are 18.4, 53.4 and 20.5 kcal mol~1, respectively. The alternative mechanism starting from the ““carbeniumÏÏ
activation
with the zinc cation abstracting the hydride ion, is unfavourable because of the high
(C2H5d`ÈHd~),
activation barrier for the Ðrst step (67.6 kcal mol~1).

Introduction
The selectivity of zeolite catalysts towards aromatisation of
small alkanes can be greatly increased by incorporation of
zinc or gallium ions.1,2 Ga-doped catalysts are well studied
and one of them is used in the commercial Cyclar process.3
However, use of a Zn modiÐer instead of Ga might be prefer-
ential from the environmental point of view. A number of
studies have addressed the location of metal cations in and
catalytic properties of the Zn-containing zeolites.1,2,4h19 A
commercial aromatisation process for light hydrocarbons with
Zn-doped H-ZSM5 as a catalyst was proposed recently.20
Zinc can be introduced to a zeolite by aqueous or solid ion
exchange techniques. Action of the
vapour on H-ZSM5
ZnCl2
also leads to a Zn-exchanged zeolite.18 K-edge X-ray adsorp-
tion studies by Biscardi et al.4 indicated that aqueous ion
exchange leads to isolated Zn2` cations in H-ZSM5. The
metal cations enter zeolite channels4h6 and substitute two
protons per Zn2`. In contrast, Zn/H-ZSM5 samples synthe-
sised by impregnation contain both Zn2` cations and external
ZnO crystallites.4 The Zn2` ions coordinate to four or six
zeolite oxygens7,8 and remain unreduced under the alkane
conversion conditions,4 while the ZnO deposits are gradually
reduced to the Zn vapour. The catalytic activity towards
alkane aromatisation is due mainly to the ionic Zn2`
species.4,9
The Ðrst step of ethane10h13 and propane14,15 aroma-
tisation in a Zn-doped zeolite catalyst is the dehydrogenation
of these alkanes to the corresponding alkenes. The alkenes
then
undergo
dehydrocyclooligomerisation.
Mechanistic
studies14 indicated that Zn (and also Ga) catalyses both dehy-
drogenation of alkane and further dehydrocyclooligomerisa-
tion, probably due to an increased rate of the H adatom
recombination to
molecules.16h18

It is very difficult to observe all the intermediates experi-
mentally and Ðnd energy parameters for the elementary steps
involved in a heterogeneous catalytic process. The quantum-
chemical modelling of the process can complement the experi-
mental

reaction mechanisms in Ga-exchanged zeolites have already
been performed.21h24 However, for Zn-exchanged zeolites we
found no previous quantum chemical publications.
The aim of this study was to compute intermediates and
transition states involved in the catalytic cycle for the dehy-
drogenation of ethane to ethene in a zinc-exchanged zeolite.
Ethane was chosen as the smallest alkane that can yield an
alkene via monomolecular dehydrogenation.

Models and details of calculations
The Zn-containing zeolite catalytic site was modelled using
the cluster approach, the currently most developed and fre-
quently used technique for studying reactions on the surface
of solids.25h29 The
ring cluster (Fig. 1) was

enough to limit the computational e†orts. Such a cluster was
previously used in studies of zeolite structural properties,31h35

increase in the cluster size is not expected to change the results
of the modelling study signiÐcantly. Indeed, in a recent study

of a related reaction, hydrogen adsorptionÈdesorption in Ga
zeolites,23 only a moderate inÑuence of the cluster size
(ranging from 1 to 5 T atoms) on the results was observed. To
saturate the dangling bonds of the cluster, we used terminal
hydrogens, which is preferred over the use of a charged
model.26,38
Two basis sets were used in the computations. The smaller
set (denoted BS1) was composed of the WachtersÈHay basis
set39 on Zn and the Pople 6È31G* set on all other atoms, and
was employed for the geometry optimisation. (The 6È31G*
basis set for Zn was deÐned40 later than the calculations were
performed.) The larger basis set (denoted BS2) was produced
from BS1 by adding polarisation functions on hydrogens and
di†use functions on all atoms as deÐned in GAUSSIAN 94,
and used for the single-point calculations in the optimised
geometries.
Geometries of the species involved were fully optimised
using the hybrid non-local density functional B3LYP41h43
method, which is known to yield good geometry parameters
at a moderate computational cost. The gradient technique44
was employed with the ““tightÏÏ keyword for convergence cri-

To reÐne the reaction heats and activation energies, higher

B3LYP single point calculations with the BS2 basis set were
performed for the optimised geometries. Corrections for the
zero-point energies (ZPE) obtained from the vibrational mode
calculations were included in the computed reaction heats and
activation energies. For comparison, we also performed
HartreeÈFock (HF)45 geometry optimisation with BS1, fol-
lowed by MP2 single point calculations with BS2.
The calculations were carried out with the GAUSSIAN 94
program.46 The natural changes47 were computed using the
NBO program48 incorporated in GAUSSIAN 94.

Results and discussion
The results of calculations provided two distinct routes of
ethane activation on the zeolite-coordinated Zn cations. The
Ðrst route starts with the ““alkylÏÏ activation of a CÈH bond
(Rd~ÈHd`), whereas the second route starts with ““carbeniumÏÏ
activation (Rd`ÈHd~).
3.1.
““AlkylÏÏ activation of ethane
The reaction route found for ““alkylÏÏ activation of ethane on
the zeolite-coordinated zinc cation is shown in Fig. 2 and con-
sists of three elementary steps. In the Ðrst step, one of the CÈH
bonds of ethane breaks heterolytically (Cd~ÈHd`) on the
Znd`ÈOd~ Lewis pair. The direction of CÈH bond polarisa-
tion is apparent from the values of charges in the transition
states II”, ]0.40e on the H atom and [0.46e on the C2H5

group. The resulting negative alkyl group binds to the zinc
cation, giving the adsorbed
cation of structure

III. The remaining proton of ethane binds to one of the zeolite
oxygens. The Ðrst step is almost thermoneutral ([0.2 kcal
mol~1 at the MP2/BS2/B3LYP/BS1 level, Table 1) and its
activation energy is 18.4 kcal mol~1.
In the second step, stretching of the Cd~ÈZnd` bond of
structure III enhances polarisation of this bond and therefore
increases the Lewis acid strength of the Zn cation. Its charge
increases from ]1.44e in III to ]1.63e in the transition struc-
ture IV”. The Zn cation polarises the b-CÈH bond of the ethyl
group, causing a negative charge [0.43e on hydrogen and a
positive charge ]0.12e on the
group. The CÈH bond
b-CH2
stretches to 1.786

This step is endoergic (26.9 kcal mol~1) and has an activation
energy of 53.4 kcal mol~1. This is the highest activation
barrier within the ““alkylÏÏ route.
The third step consists in the recombination of the BrÔnsted
proton (charge ]0.56e) bound to the zeolite oxygen with the
““hydrideÏÏ hydrogen atom (charge [0.48e) bound to Zn.

step is slightly endoergic (]5.4 kcal mol~1) and has an activa-
tion barrier of 20.5 kcal mol~1. The original catalytic species,
the zeolite-coordinated zinc cation I, is regenerated in this
step.
The data in Table 1 provide a comparison of the energy
parameters obtained at the three di†erent levels of calcu-
lations. One can see that the MP2/BS2//B3LYP/BS1 and
MP2/BS2//HF/BS1 parameters are very close (the maximum
deviation is 3.2 kcal mol~1 for the activation energy of the
second step). The B3LYP/BS2//B3LYP/BS1 reaction heats for
the second and third steps di†er more signiÐcantly from the
MP2/BS2//B3LYP/BS1 values. The B3LYP method favours
the adsorbed [ZnÈH]` cation (structure V in Fig. 2), predict-
ing lower endothermicity (by ca. 7 kcal mol~1) for its forma-
tion (second step) and higher endothermicity (by ca. 5 kcal
mol~1) for its decomposition (third step). However, the activa-
tion energies computed at these two levels are close (within 3.5
kcal mol~1). Hence there is reasonable agreement between the
results obtained at di†erent levels of calculations.
The computed heats of the dehydrogenation reaction
are within 30.8È32.1 kcal mol~1 (Table
C2H6 ] C2H4 ] H2
1). This is in good agreement with the experimental value of
30.9 kcal mol~1 derived from the heats of formation at 0 K
[16.4;

an activation energy of 62 kJ mol~1 or 14.8 kcal mol~1 for

““CarbeniumÏÏ activation of ethane
The reaction route found for ““carbeniumÏÏ activation of
ethane on the zeolite-coordinated zinc cation is shown in Fig.
3 and consists of two elementary steps. In the Ðrst step, one of
the CÈH bonds of ethane breaks heterolytically on the Znd`È
Od~ Lewis pair. In contrast to the above-considered ““alkylÏÏ
activation case, now the polarisation of this bond is Cd`ÈHd~,
as follows from the values of charges on the H atom ([0.42e)
and the
group (]0.56e) in the transition state VII”. The
C2H5
resulting hydride anion binds to the Zn atom, whereas the
ethyl cation binds to the zeolite oxygen (structure VIII). This
step is endoergic (10.2 kcal mol~1 at the MP2/BS2//B3LYP/

BS1 level). The calculated activation energy for the step is 67.6
kcal mol~1, which is much higher (ca. 49 kcal mol~1) than
that for the Ðrst step of ““alkylÏÏ activation. This may be due to
the higher electronegativity of carbon with respect to hydro-
gen, together with the low stability of the primary ethyl cation
formed upon the hydride abstraction from ethane.
In the second step, the Cd`ÈOd~ bond of structure VIII
undergoes elongation (from 1.475
in VIII to 2.376
in the
A

A

transition structure IX”). Simultaneously the positive b-
hydrogen of the ethyl group approaches the ““hydrideÏÏ hydro-
gen bound to Zn. The HÈH distance in IX” is 1.116
instead

of 6.128
in VIII. The second step results in the formation of

dihydrogen and ethene and regeneration of the original cata-
lytic species I. This step is endoergic by 21.8 kcal mol~1 and
its activation energy is 44.1 kcal mol~1.
Comparison of the two considered routes (Fig. 4) of ethane
activation
indicates
that
the
highest
barrier
within
the
““carbeniumÏÏ route (for its Ðrst step) is signiÐcantly greater
than the highest barrier within the ““alkylÏÏ route (for its
second step). The di†erence is ca. 14, 9 and 14 kcal mol~1 as
computed at the MP2/BS2//HF/BS1, B3LYP/BS2//B3LYP/
BS1 and MP2/BS2//B3LYP/BS1 levels, respectively (Table 1
and 2). Along with the lower activation energy, the second
step
of
the
““alkylÏÏ
route
should
have
a
greater
pre-
exponential factor than the Ðrst step of the ““carbeniumÏÏ
route, since the former step is monomolecular and the latter is
bimolecular. This implies that the ““alkylÏÏ route plays the
major role in the ethane dehydrogenation process.
3.3.
Discussion
The results of calculations indicate that the likely reaction
route for ethane activation in Zn-exchanged zeolites is the
““alkylÏÏ route. This route consists of three elementary steps:
cleavage of the ethane CÈH bond on the Znd`ÈOd~ pair, for-
mation of ethene from the alkyl group bound to Zn and for-
mation of dihydrogen from two surface hydrogens bound to
Zn and O.
Participation of the zeolite oxygen together with the metal
atom in activation of alkane is in agreement with the mecha-
nism proposed by Price et al.50 for Ga-exchanged zeolites.

However, the direction of the alkane CÈH bond polarisation
during activation predicted from the results of calculations is
di†erent from that assumed in the literature. Indeed, a number
of authors1,16h18 suggested that the metal atom acts as a
hydride ion acceptor, and the bond polarisation is Cd`ÈHd~.
In contrast, our calculations indicate that zinc (and also
gallium24) preferentially acts as an alkyl anion acceptor and
therefore the ethane bond polarisation is Cd~ÈHd`. Note that
our result is in line with the higher electronegativity of carbon
with respect to hydrogen, and also with the low stability of the
primary ethyl carbenium ion that should be formed in the
case of hydride abstraction.
According to the results of calculations, formation of ethene
occurs due to the reaction [ZnÈC2H5]` ] C2H4 ] [ZnÈH]`.
Although not explicitly considered so far for this system, we
found that a similar type of reaction was proposed to explain
the activity of the
catalyst for the CÈH and CÈC
ZrÈH/SiO2
bond cleavage in alkanes.51 A silica-supported zirconium
hydride catalyst was prepared51 that converts alkanes larger
than ethane (in the presence of hydrogen) into a mixture of
methane and ethane at room temperature. The reaction
mechanism o†ered51 is based on the heterolytic cleavage of
the ZrÈC bond accompanied by b-hydrogen or b-methyl
transfer to zirconium.
Formation of dihydrogen from the surface hydrogens
bound to Zn and O (the third step of our calculated reaction
route) is in line with the metal ““portholeÏÏ mechanism pro-
posed by Iglesia et al.16h18 The computed activation energies
for hydrogen desorption (20.5 kcal mol~1) and adsorption
(15.1 kcal mol~1) are close to the measured value for the
isotope exchange of
with Zn/H-ZSM-5 (14.8 kcal mol~1).4
D2
Hydrogen desorption is not the highest barrier step in our
computed reaction route, while some experimental data18
suggest that this step is the rate-determining step. However, in
the overall kinetics, hydrogen recombination may well be con-
sidered rate-limiting, since it is the co-product of alkene for-
mation, which has a higher barrier.
The present computational results for ethane activation in
Zn-doped zeolites resemble those obtained in our previous
work24 on Ga-doped zeolites. The ““alkylÏÏ route is found to
be preferred over the ““carbeniumÏÏ route in both cases. More-
over, the three elementary steps involved in the proposed
““alkylÏÏ routes for both the Zn- and Ga-doped catalysts are
similar. The Ðrst step, i.e., the cleavage of the ethane CÈH
bond, is exactly the same in both cases. The main di†erence
between the reaction mechanisms in the two catalysts is the
order of the
formation and
formation. Formation of
C2H4
H2
ethene is the second step and formation of dihydrogen is the
third step in the case of Zn, whereas in the case of Ga the
sequence of these reactions is found to be opposite.
4.
Conclusion
Quantum-chemical calculations on the mechanism of ethane
dehydrogenation catalysed by Zn-doped zeolites have been
undertaken. Two reaction mechanisms were considered, one
starting from the ““alkylÏÏ rupture of the ethane CÈH bond
and the other starting from the ““carbeniumÏÏ
(C2H5d~ÈHd`),
rupture of this bond
The results obtained indi-
(C2H5d`ÈHd~).
cate that the ““alkylÏÏ route is more likely to occur as it
involves lower activation barriers than the ““carbeniumÏÏ route.
Hence the Zn2` ion acts as an ethyl group acceptor during
ethane activation, rather than as a hydride ion acceptor.
The catalytic cycle found for ethane transformation to
ethene and dihydrogen in the Zn-doped zeolites consists of
three elementary steps: (i) rupture of the ethane CÈH bond
and binding of the ethyl group to zinc and of the proton to
the zeolite oxygen; (ii) rupture of the ethane CÈN bond and
binding of the ethyl group to zinc and of the proton to the
zeolite oxygen; (iii) formation of ethene from the ethyl group
bound to Zn; (iv) formation of dihydrogen from the BrÔnsted
proton and hydrogen bound to Zn.
The activation energies of the three elementary steps
involved in the ““alkylÏÏ route computed at the MP2/BS2/
B3LYP/BS1 level (the highest in this work) are 18.4, 53.4 and
20.5 kcal mol~1, respectively. Calculations were also per-
formed at two other levels (MP2/BS2/HF/BS1 and B3LYP/
BS2/B3LYP/BS1), and all three methods gave very similar
potential energy proÐles.
