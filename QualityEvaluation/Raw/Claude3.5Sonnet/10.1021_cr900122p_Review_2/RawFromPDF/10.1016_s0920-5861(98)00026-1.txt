Abstract
Generation of surface oxygen species and their role in partial oxidation reactions catalyzed by metal oxides are discussed.
Main attention is paid to a new concept related to a recent discovery of remarkable ability of Fe complexes stabilized in a
ZSM-5 matrix to generate a new form of surface oxygen (a-oxygen) from N2O. At room temperature, a-oxygen exhibits a
high reactivity typical for the active oxygen of monooxygenases, and mimics its unique ability to perform selective oxidation
of hydrocarbons. This opens new opportunity for creating novel technologies based on biomimetic strategy. A process of
direct oxidation of benzene to phenol, recently demonstrated by Solutia on a pilot plant scale, is evidence of great potential of
this approach. # 1998 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

Introduction
Oxygen activation on the catalyst surface is a
necessary stage for the heterogeneous reactions of
partial oxidation [1,2]. Reactions of this kind are of
great practical signiÂ®cance. They are used for manu-
facturing such important chemicals as formaldehyde,
acrolein, acrylic acid, phthalic and maleic anhydrides,
etc. However, the number of industrial processes
practised today hardly exceeds a dozen. Compared
to the large number of potentially useful reactions
these achievements are very modest.
The main reason for the limited use of oxidation
catalysis in organic synthesis is the difÂ®culty of Â®nd-
ing selective catalysts. A selective catalyst is supposed
to perform a dual function: activate oxygen by gen-
erating oxygen species of proper reactivity, and acti-
vate the starting material to direct the oxidation in the
desired way. Optimization of these two functions is a
difÂ®cult problem, since one cannot tune them inde-
pendently by varying chemical composition of the
catalysts. Often gaining in one aspect, we are losing in
the other. This is the reason, why many reactions
seemingly simple are not realized with a reasonable
selectivity.
First of all, this is true for the reactions of oxidative
hydroxylation of hydrocarbons, many of which are
carried out in industry via complex multi-stage pro-
cesses sometimes involving chemically illogical steps.

Methane oxidation to methanol and benzene oxidation
to phenol are two notable examples. To obtain the
hydroxylated products methane is Â®rst decomposed to
CO and H2, while benzene is alkylated to cumene
within a three stage cumene technology.
At the same time natural enzymes monooxygenases
(MO) can easily effect these transformations in a
single step [3] (to the continuous envy of chemists).
The catalytic performance of MO is based on a
conceptually different approach. Nature rejected
the idea of activation of the organic molecules,
instead concentrating its skills on the activation of
oxygen. Such activation is achieved with the help
of the Fe-containing centers of MO. The reactivity
of oxygen coordinated to these centers is so high
that it can insert into the non-activated CÂ±H bonds
of hydrocarbons under ambient conditions leading to
the selective formation of hydroxylated products.
Attempts to understand the mechanism and to
model unique MO functions are hindered by the
inability of artiÂ®cial systems to provide such a
powerful oxygen activation coupled with the high
selectivity.
This paper considers active oxygen species on the
surface of oxide catalysts as well as their role in the
gas-phase partial oxidation. Reactions in the liquid
phase are outside of our consideration. New concepts
in this Â®eld are discussed in other reviews published in
this issue.
This article has the following structure. First, we
will brieÂ¯y consider radical forms of oxygen species
generated on pre-reduced metal oxides; then the cur-
rent understanding of the surface oxygen participating
in the partial oxidation over conventional catalysts
will be discussed; and Â®nally, considerable attention
will be given to the new concept formed within
biomimetic approach to the oxidation catalysis. This
concept is related to the remarkable species of oxygen
(called a-oxygen) generated on iron complexes in the
ZSM-5 zeolite matrix, which in many aspects resem-
bles the active oxygen of MO. This opens a new
opportunity for both better understanding of biological
oxidation mechanisms and application of the biomi-
metic strategy to develop new oxidation processes. As
one will see, such processes are becoming closer to
reality and one of them is at the commercial devel-
opment stage.

Radical forms of oxygen
2.1.
Formation of radical anions
Adsorbed oxygen on oxide surfaces can exist in a
number of forms - molecular or atomic, neutral or
charged. It is assumed that during the adsorption on
the reduced surface, oxygen can accept electrons one
by one going in succession all the way to the fully
reduced form, i.e. O2Ã¿, which may differ only slightly
from the lattice oxygen ions [1]:
Ions OÃ¿
2 and OÃ¿ are paramagnetic and can be observed
by the ESR. Ions O2Ã¿
2
and O2Ã¿ are not paramagnetic,
and the neutral forms O2 and O, though paramagnetic,
do not give an ESR signal when on the solid surface.
Radicals OÃ¿
2 and OÃ¿ are usually obtained by room
temperature adsorption of O2 or N2O on metal oxides
that were initially reduced by CO or H2 at high
temperature. Bulk oxides with the oxygen of low
lability (MgO, ZnO, TiO2, etc.), or silica-supported
oxides of V, Mo, W are usually used for this purpose.
Generation of single-charged forms of oxygen is
favored by low concentration of the transition metal
when four electrons needed to convert dioxygen into
O2Ã¿ are not easily available.
OÃ¿
2 radical is not thermally stable. When the tem-
perature is raised above 1508C, signals of OÃ¿
2 usually
disappear. OÃ¿ radical is more stable. Upon heating, it
is consumed for reoxidation of the surface, but in some
systems still can be observed at temperatures as high
as 3008C. Because of their potential role in the oxida-
tion catalysis, chemistry of these radicals has been
thoroughly studied, mainly in the 1970s. The results of
these studies have been reviewed by Lunsford [4] and
in more detail later by Che and Tench [5,6].

2.2.
Stoichiometric reactions of OÃ¿
Surface radical OÃ¿ is highly reactive. It reacts with
H2 and CO even at the liquid nitrogen temperature.
Because in the presence of O2 ion OÃ¿ easily and
reversibly forms OÃ¿
3 , it is assumed that these species
are responsible for the low temperature isotope
exchange of oxygen [7]:
16OÃ¿ Â‡18O2 Âˆ Â‰16O18O18OÂŠÃ¿ Âˆ18 OÃ¿ Â‡16O18O
(2)
Such an exchange on some of pre-reduced oxides
occurs at Ã¿1908C. Heating in O2 leads to the disap-
pearance of both OÃ¿ and the low temperature isotope
exchange activity.
Aika and Lunsford have studied stoichiometric
reactions of alkanes and alkenes with the OÃ¿ radical
on MgO [8,9]. Very low concentration of OÃ¿ species
(100Â±200 nmol/g) required to develop a special tech-
nique for analysis of the reaction products. After the
reaction, the samples were gradually heated and the
desorbed products were condensed into a liquid nitro-
gen trap. Then the trap was thawed out and the
products were analyzed by GC. The reaction of C1Â±
C4 alkanes with OÃ¿ gave signiÂ®cant amounts of
dehydrogenation products (alkenes), but no oxyge-
nated products such as alcohols, aldehydes or epox-
ides were detected. The authors proposed hydrogen
abstraction as the initial step of the reaction yielding
alkyl radicals, which quickly transformed into surface
alkoxides (reaction 4) or alkenes (reaction 5):

Methane
reacts
with
OÃ¿
on
MgO
surface
at
Ã¿130Ã¿1508C with probable formation of methox-
ide, which decomposes upon heating to 4508C with
evolution of H2. The reaction also occurs on supported
oxides of V, Mo and W [10]. In [11], methanol was
detected among thermodesorption products of the
reaction over MoO3/SiO2.
In case of alkenes C2Â±C4 the initial stage of inter-
action with OÃ¿ is also hydrogen abstraction [9]. The
resulted radicals can then follow different reaction
pathways. 1-Butene radical is oxidized to an alkoxide
ion with subsequent formation of butadiene as the
main product. Radicals formed from ethylene and
propylene apparently are being transformed into car-
boxylate ions, which upon heating above 4508C
decompose with evolution of methane.
It should be noted that the use of thermodesorption
procedure may give a distorted picture, since the
desorbed compounds may be a result of secondary
transformations taking place at higher temperatures,
rather than products of the primary reactions.
The role of OÃ¿ radical in the oxidation of methanol
on SiO2 supported MoO3 has been recently evidenced
[12,13].
It is interesting to note that the chemical properties
of OÃ¿ radicals are quite the same in the gas phase [14],
in solution [15] and on the surface. In all cases
hydrogen abstraction is the dominating mechanism,
despite the very different reactivity of OÃ¿ species
among the different states. According to [10], the rate
constant of methane interaction with OÃ¿ on the sur-
face is 7Â±8 orders of magnitude lower than that in the
gas phase.
2.3.
Stoichiometric reactions of OÃ¿
2
Reactivity of OÃ¿
2 species is also very high, though
much inferior to OÃ¿. As for the isotope exchange, OÃ¿
2
is only capable of exchanging places with the gas
phase molecules [7]:
Â…16OÃ¿
2 Â†s Â‡18O2 Âˆ Â…18OÃ¿
2 Â†s Â‡16O2
(6)
There is no isotope scrambling, and identity of the
exchanged particles is preserved.
On ZnO and V2O5/SiO2 [16], OÃ¿
2 ion slowly reacts
with propylene at room temperature, but gives no
interaction with CO, H2 and C2H4. On MgO OÃ¿
2
radical apparently is more reactive [17]. At 1758C,
the reaction with propylene proceeds to completion
within 2 h. Acetaldehyde and methanol are detected in
the products. Authors [17] believe that the Â®rst step of
the reaction is hydrogen abstraction leading to allyl
radical:
CH2ÂˆCH Ã¿ CH3 Â‡ OÃ¿
2 ! CH2ÂˆCHÂˆCH2 Â‡ HOÃ¿
2
(7)
Then the allyl radical probably reacts with surface
oxygen ions to form acetate and formate ions.

367
In case of propane and 1-butene, oxygenated pro-
ducts with the same number of carbon atoms as the
reactant are found. It is assumed that these reactions
also start with hydrogen abstraction.
2.4.
Participation in catalytic reactions
The role of oxygen radicals in catalytic reactions is
largely based on assumptions and hypotheses. Such
radicals are formed on the pre-reduced oxides and are
stable only at low temperatures. This is far from the
conditions of catalytic reactions, which are carried out
in the presence of O2 and usually above 3008C.
However, one cannot rule out the existence of the
radicals even under these conditions because the
catalyst surface is always partially reduced by the
organic substrate [18,19]. Also, it is assumed [5] that
at elevated temperatures thermal activation of the
charge transfer with formation of OÃ¿ species is pos-
sible:
(8)
The mechanism involving OÃ¿ is widely accepted for
the catalytic dimerization of methane [20]. Formation
of ethane in the reaction of CH4 with OÃ¿ was detected
on MoO3/SiO2 even at room temperature [10]. Ethane
is suggested to result from recombination of methyl
radicals formed in the reaction with OÃ¿:
CH4 Â‡ Â…OÃ¿Â†s ! Â…OHÃ¿Â†s Â‡ CH


(9)
Frike et al. [21] studied the role of radical anions in
the oxidation of butene to maleic anhydride over
V2O5Â±P2O5 catalysts. Because OÃ¿
2 and OÃ¿ are stabi-
lized
on
vanadium
cations
their
concentration
decreases with increasing P2O5 content. At the same
time selectivity of the reaction grows and reaches a
maximum at P:V Âˆ2:1. This allows to conclude that
oxygen radicals are not selective. Though presently
this is a widely accepted point of view [1,22], experi-
mental results sometimes prompt authors to assume
OÃ¿ species to be responsible for selective reactions,
especially when nitrous oxide is used as an oxidant
[23,24].
Some authors consider neutral atomic oxygen O to
be the active species in oxidation reactions. Such
mechanism was proposed for ethane dehydrogenation
in the presence of N2O over Co2Â‡/MgO [25] and over
ZSM-5 [26], and also for the oxidative coupling of
methane over modiÂ®ed calcium oxide [27].
3.
Active oxygen on conventional partial
oxidation catalysts
Contrary to the situation with radicals OÃ¿ and OÃ¿
2 ,
that can be easily identiÂ®ed and studied at low tem-
peratures, practical oxidation catalysis offers a situa-
tion that is much more complicated to study. Classical
catalysts for the selective oxidation leading to
oxygenated products are usually complex systems
based on oxides of Mo or V [28]. Oxidations are
usually carried out at 350Â±5008C under conditions
when different oxygen species can rapidly undergo
transformations into one another. Oxygen isotope
exchange provides a convincing evidence for such
transformations. This method was widely used, espe-
cially in the 1960Â±70s to obtain valuable information
on the mechanism of oxygen activation [29,30]. In
many oxides important for the partial oxidation
(V2O5, MoO3, WO3, Sb2O5, SnO2, etc.), the exchange
involves not only the surface oxygen, but also most of
the lattice oxygen atoms. This fast exchange is a
reason why despite signiÂ®cant efforts, the real nature
of the intermediate oxygen species in the oxidative
catalysis remains unclear. Our knowledge in this area
is limited by more or less substantiated hypotheses
that are generally qualitative. They will be brieÂ¯y
considered below.
3.1.
Bond energy
In the early studies, signiÂ®cant attention was paid to
discover a correlation between the catalytic properties
and bonding energy of the surface oxygen of oxides
[31Â±34]. These studies allowed Boreskov and co-
workers [1,35] to formulate some useful rules for
prediction of the catalytic activity, especially for the
deep oxidation. A correlation was established between
the heat of dissociative O2 adsorption, q(O2), and the
rate of oxidation of various molecules (H2, CH4, C2H6,
etc.) to H2O and CO2. The reason for this correlation is
that the heat of oxygen adsorption contributes to the
368
G.I. Panov et al. / Catalysis Today 41 (1998) 365Â±385
activation energy of reaction:
E Âˆ E0 Â‡ qÂ…O2Â†
(10)
The highest oxidation rate is observed for oxides of
Co, Cu, Mn, Ni with the lowest value of q(O2)Âˆ16Â±
20 kcal/mole, whereas the lowest rate is observed for
titanium oxide for which q(O2) is the highest at
60 kcal/mole. It is interesting to note that for all the
reactions coefÂ®cients  in Eq. (10) are close to 0.5
[36]. This indicates that the deep oxidation involves
active oxygen species of the same nature, though their
bonding energies to the surface are different.
In partial oxidation, the role of oxygen bond energy
is also very important, but not so straightforward. For
efÂ®cient catalysts, q(O2) should be in a certain optimal
range. Low bonding energy would favor deep oxida-
tion, high bonding energy would reduce the reaction
rate. Experiments have shown that q(O2) for selective
oxidation catalysts lies in the range of 50Â±60 kcal/
mole O2 [19].
3.2.
The role of adsorbed and lattice oxygen
Theoretically, both adsorbed and lattice oxygen can
take part in the oxidation. It is widely agreed that the
lattice oxygen plays an important role in selective
oxidation. Indeed, it was shown in a number of works
[18,19,37Â±39] that partial oxidation catalysts can
serve by themselves as a source of active oxygen
and for some time perform the oxidation in the
absence of O2 in the gas phase. The amount of
consumed oxygen could correspond to several mono-
layers. Subsequent reoxidation restores the depleted
oxygen. Experiments using 18O [38,39] are especially
illustrative of the lattice oxygen participation.
A general scheme of catalytic oxidation including
two stages of oxygen transformation was suggested in
[18]: 1) a primary activation with the formation of
highly reactive electrophilic species and 2) subsequent
incorporation of these species into the lattice:
(11)
Here, Os is partially reduced species of oxygen which
could be represented by the surface radicals discussed
above. Such electrophilic species are mostly respon-
sible for the deep oxidation, the attack on multiple
bonds being especially easy [40]. Olatt. is a lattice
oxygen which, according to the majority of opinions,
is responsible for the partial oxidation.
According to this scheme, the catalyst selectivity
should be controlled by the ratio of the rates of
primary oxygen activation and its subsequent incor-
poration into the lattice. Indeed, a wealth of experi-
mental data shows that the surface of deep oxidation
catalysts (Co3O4, CuO, MnO2, NiO) contains large
quantities of loosely bound oxygen, which is different
from the lattice oxygen. At the same time, partial
oxidation catalysts (MoO3, V2O5, WO3, Sb2O5 and
compositions based on them) provide no evidence of
loosely bound oxygen [1,19].
3.3.
Role of oxygen diffusion
A number of theories explaining selectivity of oxide
catalysts are based on the important role of the surface
and bulk oxygen diffusion [37,40Â±43]. It is assumed
that oxygen is supplied to the surface sites not directly
from the gas phase, but via volume diffusion [41] or
diffusion from the other surface sites. A consistent
remote control concept was proposed by Delmon and
coworkers to explain a synergetic effect in the oxida-
tion of oleÂ®ns over multicomponent catalysts [43].
According to this concept a donor phase, e.g. Sb2O4,
adsorbs the oxygen from the gas phase, which is then
transferred by a spill-over mechanism to an acceptor
phase, e.g. MoO3, which hosts active and selective
sites.
The study of parafÂ®n partial oxidation catalysts
gave different observations [44]. In this case, to avoid
overoxidation, the active sites (usually vanadium ions)
must be isolated in the inert matrix of the support to
prevent oxygen diffusion from the neighboring sites.
A detailed study of vanadium oxide supported on a
variety of carriers [45] concluded that the presence of
VÂ±OÂ±V fragments was essential for the selective
oxidation.
In [46,47], a hypothesis was put forward in which
the partial oxidation is carried out with the oxygen
species bound to the transition metal cations by a
double bond M=O and giving IR adsorption in the
range of 900Â±1100 cmÃ¿1. Indeed, such oxygen is
G.I. Panov et al. / Catalysis Today 41 (1998) 365Â±385
369
present on partial oxidation catalysts, but not found on
the catalysts of deep oxidation such as oxides of Co,
Ni, Fe.
In conclusion, we may note that identiÂ®cation
of
the
active
oxygen
species
participating
the
oxidation (concentration, charge, bond energy, etc.)
is still an open question. Rapid interconversion of the
species prevents a reliable answer to the question.
Even in case when the reaction occurs by using
lattice oxygen (in the absence of O2) one cannot
completely rule out a hypothesis that actual intermedi-
ate species is still a loosely bound oxygen like OÃ¿. As
was mentioned earlier, such forms can be generated as
a result of charge transfer from O2Ã¿ ion to metal
cation.
4.
Active oxygen on FeZSM-5 zeolite
Zeolites are crystalline alumosilicates and as such
are of no interest for redox reactions. Unlike other
oxides, they have an intracrystalline system of micro-
pores of molecular dimensions. Chemical composi-
tion of zeolites can be modiÂ®ed by transition metals
due to their incorporation either into the crystal lattice
or into the micropore space. Such modiÂ®cations have
been extensively used in the last decade. Several new
catalysts of redox type with incorporated metal in
ZSM-5 zeolites and their analogues act more efÂ®-
ciently than conventional oxide systems. Some of
the examples are titanium, and vanadium silicalites
for the liquid phase oxidation with H2O2 [48,49],
vanadium silicalites for oxidative dehydrogenation
of hydrocarbons [50], CuZSM-5 for decomposition
of NO [51] and CoZSM-5 for decomposition of N2O
[52].
ModiÂ®cation with Fe is a special case. Unlike other
metals, whose oxides initially exhibit some activity of
the same sort as that after the introduction into the
zeolite, iron atoms in ZSM-5 matrix acquire funda-
mentally new features compared to the free Fe2O3.
The iron loses its ability to activate O2, but acquires
special afÂ®nity towards nitrous oxide, causing its
decomposition in a particular way [53]. This reaction
gives rise to the formation of a new form of surface
oxygen (called a-oxygen [54]) which, as one can see
further, is behind a unique performance of FeZSM-5
zeolites in the oxidation with N2O.
4.1.
Formation of a-oxygen. The role of iron
Authors of the Â®rst papers discovering a-oxygen
formation at N2O decomposition related this phenom-
enon either to the presence of a single electron donorÂ±
acceptor sites in ZSM-5 zeolite [55] or to the admix-
ture of transition metals [56]. Later, a hypothesis was
also suggested [57] to correlate a-oxygen with coor-
dinatively unsaturated aluminum atoms of the zeolite
(Lewis acid sites). Detailed studies on the meachanism
of N2O decomposition performed over ZSM-5 zeolites
[58] and their ferrosilicate analogs [53] have shown
that formation of a-oxygen relates to the presence of
iron.
The role of iron is illustrated by Fig. 1. It shows the
results of a temperature programmed N2O decompo-
sition over ZSM-5 zeolites with different iron content.
Experiments were carried out in a static unit equipped
with a microreactor, which provides high accuracy of
adsorption and kinetic measurements. The following
procedure was used. After a standard pretreatment in
vacuum and oxygen at 5508C, the samples were
cooled to 508C and 0.4 Torr of N2O was introduced
into the reaction space. At time A the reactor was
opened and, after the adsorption equilibrium was
established, the heating was turned on (time B).
The composition of the gas phase was followed by
mass-spectrometry.
The spectrum for the sample containing almost no
iron (Fig. 1(a)) is typical for conventional catalytic
systems. In this case raising the temperature to around
2008C leads to complete desorption of N2O and
restoration of the initial pressure, which remains
unchanged up to 4508C. Above this temperature,
decomposition of N2O takes place with the evolution
of O2 and N2 into the gas phase.
There is a drastically changed picture for the sample
containing 0.056 wt% Fe (Fig. 1(b)). Here, after the
initial adsorption, P(N2O) does not reach its original
value because at 1508C nitrous oxide starts to decom-
pose, which is evidenced by the evolution of dinitro-
gen. This picture is even more pronounced for the
sample with 0.35 wt% Fe. In this case, the decom-
position becomes noticeable even at lower tempera-
tures. An unusual feature of this low temperature
decomposition is that only N2 is evolved into the
gas phase while oxygen remains completely bound
to the active sites to form a-oxygen:
370
G.I. Panov et al. / Catalysis Today 41 (1998) 365Â±385
N2O Â‡ Â… Â† Âˆ Â…OÂ† Â‡ N2
(12)
Oxygen desorption starts only at 3008C. Above this
temperature the decomposition proceeds as a `normal'
catalytic process with stoichiometric evolution of N2
and O2 into the gas phase:
N2O Âˆ N2 Â‡ 1=2O2
(13)
4.2.
Measurement of a-oxygen concentration
a-Oxygen can be loaded onto FeZSM-5 surface by
N2O decomposition at temperatures below 3008C.
Fig. 2 shows results of such an experiment at
2308C for the sample containing 0.53 wt% Fe. One
can see that the reaction is stoichiometric and actually
follows Eq. (12). As all the a-sites Â®ll up, the reaction
stops.
For further quantitative studies, it is imperative to
know the concentration of a-oxygen. There are sev-
eral methods for its reliable determination. This can be
done either by direct measurement of dinitrogen
evolved (or N2O consumed) in reaction (12), or by
desorption of Oa into the gas phase upon heating the
sample to above 3008C. Another very convenient
method is O2 isotope exchange involving a-oxygen:
Â…16OÂ† Â‡18O2 Â„ Â…18OÂ† Â‡16O18O
(14)
Reaction (14) proceeds at a high rate at room tem-
perature. The zeolite lattice oxygen is inert in the
isotope exchange up to 5008C and does not interfere
with the measurement of a-oxygen. After the equili-
brium is established, since the 18O content of a-
oxygen and dioxygen of the gas phase is the same,
one can calculate the amount of Oa.
The concentration of a-sites (Ca) is calculated
based on the maximum amount of a-oxygen that
can be loaded onto the sample by reaction (12), and
assuming that one atom of Oa occupies one a-site.
The values of Ca measured with different methods are
quite consistent [59]. Depending on Fe content and on
the mode of catalyst activation, Ca can be regulated
within several orders of magnitude, reaching up to
nearly 100 mmol/g for the most active catalysts.
4.3.
Kinetics of a-oxygen loading
The initial rate of a-oxygen loading can be deter-
mined by graphic differentiation of the initial portions

of the curves in Fig. 2. Arrhenius plots for N2O
decomposition (0.2 Torr) over three FeZSM-5 sam-
ples (see Table 1 for their characteristics) are shown in
Fig. 3. It is apparent that iron content plays an impor-
tant role in the process. An increase of CFe from
0.056 wt% Fe to 0.53 wt% Fe leads to an order of
magnitude increase in the reaction rate calculated per
gram of the sample (Wg). At 2008C, the rate goes from
4.51015 molecules N2O/gs to 5.61016 molecules
N2O/gs (Table 1). However, if the reaction rate is
calculated per a-site (Wa) rather than per gram of the
catalyst, then its value becomes constant, which is
evidence for uniform activity of a-sites. This is illu-
strated especially well by the Arrhenius plot of Wa in
Fig. 3(b). The plot shows that experimental results for
all three samples seem to be a part of the same
function, giving the activation energy of 10 kcal/mole.
Fig. 4 shows the inÂ¯uence of N2O pressure on the
reaction rate. At 1708C, the reaction is Â®rst order (n
Âˆ1). With increasing temperature, the value of n
decreases due to the increased importance of diffu-
sion. In general, the reaction of a-oxygen loading in
kinetic region is described by the following equation:
W Âˆ C  K0eÃ¿10 000=RT  PN2O
(15)
Note that uniform a-site activity for FeZSM-5
zeolites of different chemical composition was also
observed for the catalytic N2O decomposition (i.e.
above 3008C) [53] and for the oxidation of benzene to
phenol with nitrous oxide [60].

a-Oxygen features
a-Oxygen is stable up to 3008C. Above this tem-
perature, it desorbes irreversibly into the gas phase as
O2. Considerable thermal stability along with the
possibility to create high concentrations of a-oxygen
suggest nice opportunity to study its physico-chemical
properties. The initial experiments have already
shown that Oa has an extremely high reactivity
[56,58]. At room temperature, it participates in oxygen
isotope exchange, interacts with H2, CO, and various
organic molecules.
According to a generally accepted view, high reac-
tivity is a feature of oxygen species having a low
energy bonding to the surface [1,32]. The bonding
energy is usually represented as a heat of dissociative
adsorption of dioxygen, q(O2), corresponding to the
reaction:
O2 Â‡ 2Â… Â†S Âˆ 2Â…OÂ†S
(16)
Therefore, one can expect to Â®nd a very low q(O2)
value for a-oxygen. Theoretically, it can even
be negative because of the endothermic nature of
N2O (H0
f Âˆ Â‡ 19.5 kcal/mol) as the source of
oxygen.
Because direct loading of a-oxygen from O2 is not
possible, the authors [61] conducted calorimetric
measurements of the heat of N2O decomposition over
FeZSM-5 under two conditions: with Oa loading (q1,
reaction 12) and without Oa loading (q2, reaction 13).
The difference between q1 and q2 gives the value qa of
the hypothetical reaction (17) in which a-oxygen
would form from O2:
O2 Â‡ 2Â… Â† ! 2Â…OÂ†a Â‡ qa
(17)
The qa value indeed turned out to be very low and
equals 1Â±6 kcal/mole O2. This explains both the
exceptional reactivity of a-oxygen, and the impossi-
bility of its generation from O2.
Such a low value of qa seems to be incompatible
with the high thermal stability of Oa. This may be
explained by the fact that a-sites are separated from
each other by high energy barriers that prevents the
surface diffusion and recombination of Oa atoms. This
assumption also agrees with the low density of a-sites
on the zeolite surface. Thus, with a zeolite surface area
of 400 m2/g and an a-site concentration of 21019 site/
g, the surface density will be 51016 a-site/m2 which is
less than 1% of the surface density of an oxygen
monolayer.
The isolated spatial position of a-sites is also in
agreement with the fact that Oa can not be loaded
using NO, though thermodynamically this molecule is
close to N2O. The mechanism of NO decomposition is
more complex [62], and contrary to N2O, dissociation
of NO cannot occur on an isolated center. Therefore,
NO decomposition on FeZSM-5 zeolites does not take
place at temperatures below 5008C [58].
4.5.
Stoichiometric reaction with benzene
We have already mentioned that at room tem-
perature a-oxygen can react with various organic
molecules. However, the
resulting
products
are
strongly bound to the zeolite surface and their identi-
Â®cation is not easily available. The products of a-
oxygen interaction with benzene are of special inter-
est, because ZSM-5 zeolites turned out to be excellent
catalysts for direct oxidation of benzene to phenol
[54]:
C6H6 Â‡ N2O ! C6H5OH Â‡ N2
(18)
which occurs with nearly a 100% selectivity. The
mechanism of this reaction is the subject of discussion.
Some authors [63Â±66] consider Bro
Ãˆnsted acid centers
to be responsible for occurrence of reaction (18),
whereas other authors [67,68] relate the catalytic
activity to the ability of the zeolite to generate a
special active species of surface oxygen. It seems
natural to assume that it is a-oxygen that plays the
role of this active oxygen species. However, the
properties of a-oxygen, especially its high reactivity,
are very far from the classical image of the surface
oxygen responsible for partial oxidation [1,2]. That is
why the idea of relating Oa to the phenol formation
needs strong experimental support.
Attempts to use spectroscopic techniques (IR,
NMR) did not give positive results. Another idea
was prompted by the fact that a-oxygen can be created
at a rather high concentration. An estimation showed
that if the interaction of benzene with a-oxygen
indeed leads to phenol formation and if this phenol
could be extracted from the surface, its amount would
be enough for analysis using the regular GC method.
Experiments based on this idea were conducted in [69]
according to the following scheme:

25CÂ…C6H5OHÂ†
3: Â…C6H5OHÂ† !
25C C6H5OH Â‡ Â… Â†
The scheme includes a-oxygen loading (step 1), its
reaction with benzene at room temperature (step 2),
and the product extraction by methanol (step 3). The
results for one of the catalysts are presented in Table 2
[70]. The average phenol yield was around 90%. No
other products were detected.
These results constitute strong evidence that a-
oxygen plays a key role in benzene oxidation to phenol
and the steps 1Â±3 are main stages of the reaction
mechanism.

Biomimetic mechanism of oxidation
by a-oxygen
5.1.
Oxidation of methane
The hydroxylation of aromatics is a typical reaction
for enzyme monooxygenase (MO) catalysis. There-
fore, the ability of a-oxygen to selectively oxidize
benzene at room temperature is a very suggestive
phenomenon for the mimicking of monooxygenase
oxygen activation.
SigniÂ®cant effort is being directed at creating bio-
mimetic systems functioning in liquid phase and
generating active oxygen species similar to those of
MO. Various sources of oxygen such as peroxides,
peracids, iodosobenzene, etc. are being used along
with O2. Recently, N2O was also tried for this purpose
[71]. One of the major advances in this Â®eld is oleÂ®n
epoxidation systems, which mimic cytochrome P-450
[72,73]. Success in the oxidation of arenes and alkanes
is much more modest, though some systems mimick-
ing MO activity have been also reported [73Â±76],
including those based on metal-containing zeolites
[77Â±79]. The most challenging task is to mimic
methane monooxygenases (MMO). The active sites
of MMO, containing two iron atoms, are capable of
generating oxygen species of outstanding reactivity
that enables the oxidation of even methane at room
temperature, resulting in selective formation of metha-
nol [3].
Attempts to create biomimetic systems capable of
performing this reaction chemically did not yield yet
signiÂ®cant results. A number of catalysts for oxidation
of methane to methanol have been found and some of
them exhibit high selectivity at low methane conver-
sions [75,80]. However, these catalysts require tem-
peratures as high as 400Â±5008C, so they can hardly be
considered as a functional MMO model. Recently, this
reaction was reported to occur at 250Â±3008C on FePO4
catalyst using in-situ generation of H2O2 [81]. This
probably is the closest case, though the reported
conditions are still far from those at which MMOs
operate. That is why the question of whether a-oxygen
is capable of methane oxidation to methanol is of great
interest.
We have noted already that a-oxygen promptly
interacts
with
methane
at
room
temperature.
However, the product of this interaction is tightly
bound to the surface and upon heating decomposes
evolving CO into the gas phase [59]. For identiÂ®cation
of the product, authors [82] used an extraction
method described above for the case of stoichio-
metric reaction of Oa with benzene. The results are
shown in Table 3. Methanol was the only product
with the yield 90Â±100%. In a blank experiment
(without a-oxygen loading) no interaction of methane
was observed and no methanol was found after
extraction.
Zeolites are known to readily adsorb various com-
pounds present in the environment even in minute
concentrations. To make sure that the detected metha-
nol did not accidentally come from an outside source,
13C and 18O isotopic labeling was used [70]. These
experiments have shown unambiguously that the
methanol extracted from the surface was being formed
by the reaction of methane with a-oxygen:

Interestingly, this reaction is so fast that its rate could
not be measured not only at room temperature, but
even Ã¿308C, which is another indication of the very
high reactivity of a-oxygen.
5.2.
Kinetic isotope effect in oxidations by a-
oxygen
To check if the analogy between biological oxida-
tion and a-oxygen oxidation goes beyond the simi-
larity of the products formed (methanol from methane,
phenol from benzene) it is important to compare the
reaction mechanisms. Accordingly, a kinetic isotope
effect (KIE) study of methane and benzene oxidation
by a-oxygen was carried out in [83]. The experiments
consisted of the following steps:
1. a-Oxygen loading onto FeZSM-5 surface at
2508C;
2. Reaction of a-oxygen with H- and D-containing
molecules of methane and benzene at various
temperatures;
3. Product extraction and its isotopic analysis by GC/
MS and NMR.
5.2.1.
KIE in methane oxidation
Kinetic isotope effect (KIE) is often studied using
intermolecular method, which is based on the rate
measurements for H- and D-containing substrates and
then KIEÂˆkH/kD. In case of methane oxidation with a-
oxygen this method was unusable: the reaction rate
was too high and limited by methane diffusion in the
zeolite micropores [59]. To avoid the inÂ¯uence of
diffusion, authors [83] used the intramolecular method
in which isotope effect is determined by the competi-
tion of CÂ±H and CÂ±D bonds entering the same mole-
cule. Dideuteromethane CH2D2 was used for the
reaction with a-oxygen leading to two products
CHD2OH and CH2DOD depending on the site of
oxygen insertion (CÂ±H or CÂ±D bond). Values of
KIE
calculated
from
relative
concentrations
of
CHD2OH and CH2DOD molecules are given in
Table 4. When the reaction temperature is decreased
from Â‡100 to Ã¿508C, KIE increases from 1.9 to 5.5.
5.2.2.
KIE in benzene oxidation
Kinetic isotope effect (KIE) in benzene oxidation
was also measured by intramolecular method using
symmetrical 1,3,5-D3-benzene [83]. In this case, oxi-
dation with a-oxygen leads to the following isotopo-
mers of phenol:

by the reaction of C6H3D3 with a-oxygen at 258C.

1Âˆ7.34 and 2Âˆ6.94 ppm (assigned to the protons of
C6H2D3OD and C6H3D2OD, respectively) was found
to be close to 1.0 (Table 4). GC/MS analysis (relative
intensities of peaks with m/e 97 and 98) conÂ®rmed this
observation.
Thus, contrary to methane, KIE in benzene oxida-
tion by a-oxygen is 1.0, which agrees with the results
for MO (see below).
5.3.
Active state of iron
As noted above, Fe entering a-sites loses its ability
to activate molecular dioxygen. Its catalytic activity in
O2 isotope exchange is four orders of magnitude lower
than that of Fe atoms on the Fe2O3 surface [53]. At the
same time its activity in N2O decomposition is
increased by 2 orders of magnitude. Even more
important, the iron in this state acquires a remarkable
ability to generate a-oxygen species not observed in
any other system studied [54]. These results cannot be
explained by mechanical dispersion of Fe2O3 phase
and point to profound changes in the Fe state within
the zeolite matrix.
There are two questions concerning the state of
active iron: i) location of a-sites and ii) structure of a-
sites.
5.3.1.
Location of a-sites
The distribution of iron and other metals in zeolites
has been studied extensively. In general, Fe can
occupy three positions in ZSM-5 matrix [84Â±87]
and can exist as:
1. Isolated ions in tetrahedral positions of the crystal
lattice;
2. Isolated ions or small complexes inside the intra-
crystalline micropore space;
3. Finely dispersed oxide phase on the outer surface
of zeolite crystals.
Which of these iron states form a-sites is a question of
great importance.
The Â®rst position can be safely ruled out, because
high-temperature calcination leads not only to the
removal of Fe atoms from the lattice but also to
signiÂ®cant increase in a-site concentration [88]. Addi-
tionally, a-sites can be created by impregnation of a
ready-made zeolite matrix when the probability of Fe
insertion into the lattice is very low [89]. The third
position can also be ruled out: deactivation of the
external zeolite surface by covering with inert SiO2
layer does not alter the concentration of a-sites [90].
Thus, the conclusion that a-sites are related to Fe
atoms in the second position seems very reasonable,
meaning that they are made of isolated atoms or small
Fe complexes located inside ZSM-5 micropore space.
This conclusion is also supported by results from
milling of the zeolite crystals [91].
5.3.2.
The structure of a-sites
The question about structure of a-sites is more
difÂ®cult. Early attempts to use for this purpose spec-
troscopic techniques (NMR, IR, EXAFS) failed to

give interpretable information. The task was compli-
cated by the fact that those samples that had high ratio
of the active to inactive Fe also had a total iron
concentration too low for reliable measurements.
Also, for those samples where the total Fe concentra-
tion was sufÂ®cient, the active iron was masked by an
excess of its inactive forms. Recent development of
methods for making zeolites with high concentration
of a-sites [88] improves the prospects of studying iron
in a-sites. This study is now under way and the
following
information
is
partly
of
preliminary
nature.
a-Sites are most probably associated with binuclear
Fe complexes, rather than with isolated atoms [82].
The following Â®ndings led to this conclusion:
a) The concentration ratio of a-sites to iron atoms
(Ca : CFe) depends on the iron content in the
zeolite and on conditions of its activation,
reaching for some cases the value of 1:2, which
is the upper limit if the hypothesis of binuclear
structure of a-sites is true. We were unable to
reliably attain Ca: CFe higher that 1:2.
b) Active Fe is not observed by the ESR [53],
which is in agreement with an assumption of
diamagnetic binuclear complexes.
c) Experimentally, observed characteristics of a-
oxygen can be explained by binuclear quantum
chemical model of a-sites [92].
d) Mo
Ãˆssbauer spectral parameters for FeZSM-5 fall
into the range typical for oxo-bridged binuclear Fe
complexes [93].
Mo
Ãˆssbauer spectroscopy is one of the most infor-
mative methods to study the state of Fe. This method
was used successfully for the study of MMO [94].
Depending on the conditions, MMO iron can exist in
either a reduced or an oxidized state. Each of these
states gives rise to the respective quadruple doublet
(see Table 5).
Fig. 6 shows Mo
Ãˆssbauer spectra for 57FeZSM-5
zeolite, activated at 9008C, before and after loading
it with a-oxygen. The sample contains 0.24 wt% 57Fe
and its a-site concentration is 1.31019 site/g, which
approximately corresponds to Ca:CFe Âˆ1:2. Similar to
MMO, the sample contains two states of Fe. The
narrow doublet corresponds to Fe3Â‡, while the wide
doublet corresponds to Fe2Â‡, which is the main state of
the iron before Oa loading (spectrum a). Loading the
sample with a-oxygen leads to a dramatic change in
the state of iron caused by the oxidation of Fe2Â‡ into
Fe3Â‡ (spectrum b). Interpretation of the resulting
spectrum indicates either the appearance of two states
of Fe3Â‡, or non-equivalence of the ligand environment
of two Fe3Â‡ ions of the same complex [93]. This

change is reversible, desorption of a-oxygen returns
the initial spectrum a.
There is a excellent agreement between the spectral
parameters of both the reduced and oxidized states of
iron in 57FeZSM-5 to that of di-iron MMO complexes
(Table 5), which offers additional evidence in favor of
binuclear structure of a-sites. To make a Â®nal con-
clusion on the structure of a-sites, additional Mo
Ãˆss-
bauer measurements have to be done in the presence of
magnetic Â®eld.
5.4.
Comparison with monooxygenases
Experimental data on methane oxidation convin-
cingly show that the chemical properties of a-oxygen
are close to those of the active oxygen of methane
monooxygenases. High values of KIE being in the
range of 5 [95] to 11.8 [96] are characteristic for
oxidation of methane by MMO. Unusually, high
values of kH/kD of 50Â±100 were observed for the
interaction of methane with the active intermediate
of MMO (component Q), which is probably attributed
to signiÂ®cant contribution of tunneling [97]. Large
values of KIE indicate that CÂ±H bond breaking is
involved in the limiting step of methane oxidation by
MMO. Similar conclusion can be made for methane
oxidation by a-oxygen, for which large KIE values are
also observed.
FeZSM-5 is thermally stable and allows reliable
KIE measurements over a wide range of temperatures.
The temperature dependence of KIE in methane oxi-
dation by a-oxygen over Ã¿50 to Â‡1008C is well
described by an Arrhenius plot [83]. The slope of this
plot indicates that the activation energy difference for
oxidation of CÂ±H and CÂ±D bonds of methane is 5.0 kJ/
mole, which is in a good agreement with the zero-
point energy difference for these bonds. This also
shows that in this case tunneling makes no signiÂ®cant
contribution. (The value of the preexponential factor is
another parameter to show the importance of tunnel-
ing [98]. However, the very high rate of the reaction
made it impossible to estimate this factor.)
The main feature of MMO that makes it different
from other monooxygenases is the binuclear nature of
its active sites. Studies of the active iron in FeZSM-5
also indicate that a-sites may have binuclear structure.
According to recent quantum mechanical calculations
[99], methane oxidation on FeZSM-5 proceeds with
participation of binuclear complexes having Fe atoms
bound by (m-oxo-) and (m-hydroxo-) bridges. The
calculations showed that these complexes are capable
of binding oxygen atom from N2O, and the formed
ferrocomplexes have high activity towards methane. It
is interesting to note that dinuclear oxo (or hydroxo)
metal complexes, whose remarkable chemical poten-
tials are still to be understood, seem to be widely and
successfully used in nature, when it is necessary to
create highly active oxygen species. Thus, enzyme
wateroxidase as well as most of its artiÂ®cial mimics
are also based on the dinuclear (di-iron in particular)
metal complexes as the functional units [100].
Along
with
the
notable
similarities
between
methane oxidation by MMO and FeZSM-5, there
are also some differences, namely: the absence of
tunneling and lower values of KIE for FeZSM-5.
However, we still believe that the nature of active
sites and the reaction mechanism for the enzyme and
the inorganic model have much in common. The
oxygen atom of a-site may have the same kind of
stabilization between two iron atoms as in bis-m-
oxodi-iron active intermediate proposed for MMO
[101]. Recently, evidence has been obtained that
similar intermediates were being formed in model
chemical systems [102]. A redox equilibrium between
bis-m-oxo Fe(IV) and Fe(III) oxenic forms is possible
for such an intermediate:
The differences observed between the enzyme and
FeZSM-5 can be attributed to a softer ligand environ-
ment around Fe in MMO. This leads to stabilization of
Fe(IV) and to a shifting of the equilibrium to the left.
In case of a harder ligand environment in FeZSM-5,
stabilization of Fe(IV) is not favored and the equili-
brium is shifted toward the more reactive oxenic form.
This might explain the lower values of KIE and the
absence of tunneling in case of FeZSM-5.
In any case, the mechanism of methane oxidation by
a-oxygen on iron complexes in ZSM-5 shows this
system to be a new and successful model for active
feroxo-intermediates effecting alkane hydroxylation
in the MMO catalytic cycle. The generally accepted
mechanism
of
alkane
hydroxylation
by
MMO
assumes that the interaction of the active feroxo-
378
G.I. Panov et al. / Catalysis Today 41 (1998) 365Â±385
intermediate with alkanes follows eliminationÂ±addi-
tion route. Direct insertion of oxygen atom into
methane CÂ±H bond via 5-coordinated intermediate
state of carbon is also conceivable [103].
Along with alkanes, MMO can oxidize a wide
variety of other organic compounds including arenes
[3]. In hydroxylation of arenes by both MMO and
cytochrome P-450 the observed KIE is close to unity
[104]. For cytochrome P-450 the reaction is assumed
to proceed via the initial formation of unstable arene-
oxides, which can spontaneously isomerise into phe-
nolic products [105,106]. In a number of cases,
areneoxide intermediates have been isolated. It is
noteworthy that formation of such intermediates
should have no isotope effect since there is no CÂ±H
bond breaking involved.
Similar mechanism is proposed for benzene oxida-
tion by a-oxygen and illustrated by the following
scheme [83]:
The lack of KIE, similar to monooxygenases, indi-
cates that step (2) involving the breaking of the CÂ±H
bond should be fast, whereas step (1) is the rate
limiting.
6.
Comparison of Oa with other species
of surface oxygen
In the previous sections of the paper, we have seen
that there are several types of oxygen species that can
exist on the surface. Some of them have been experi-
mentally studied, while the others are hypothetical and
cannot be observed directly. It is of interest to compare
a-oxygen with well studied OÃ¿ and OÃ¿
2 radicals that
were discussed earlier. The goal of such a comparison
would be to Â®nd out if Oa is in fact a new species or
identical to a known one.
The data for comparison of Oa, OÃ¿ and OÃ¿
2 are
given in Table 6. Signs (Â‡) and (Ã¿) indicate the
presence or the absence of the characteristic in
question.
Molecular radical OÃ¿
2 can be easily ruled out as a
candidate for a-oxygen. Indeed, just a brief considera-
tion of Table 6 shows that Oa is not OÃ¿
2 since most of
their characteristics are different. Comparison of Oa
with OÃ¿ requires a more detailed discussion. Some of
their properties are quite similar. First of all, they both
have high reactivity: at room temperature, both spe-
cies oxidize H2, CO and organic molecules, including
methane. Both species participate also in O2 homo-
and heteroexchange.
At the same time, there are enough differences to
suggest that these species are not identical. Firstly,
they are generated on different surfaces and under
different conditions. While Oa can only be formed on
Fe complexes in a zeolite matrix, formation of OÃ¿ can
take place on the surface of many metal oxides. Both
O2 and N2O can serve as oxygen source for OÃ¿,
whereas Oa can be formed only from N2O. Formation
of OÃ¿ happens only after reductive pretreatment of the
surface, but a-oxygen can be formed after high tem-
perature pretreatment in O2.
Thermal destruction of these species proceeds also
in a different way. With the temperature increase, a-
oxygen desorbes into the gas phase as O2, while OÃ¿
radical is used up for reoxidation of the surface.
Attempts to detect a-oxygen by the ESR were unsuc-
cessful [53].
Different chemistry of Oa and OÃ¿ is a very impor-
tant point. Despite a similar reactivity, the oxidation
reactions by these species follow different mechan-
isms.
Hydrogen
abstraction
mechanism
leading
mostly to dehydrogenation and dimerization products
is characteristic for OÃ¿ radicals. The mechanism of
oxygen addition, which is much more promising for
the organic synthesis, is a characteristic of Oa .
In conclusion, we may summarize that the data
in Table 6 show a-oxygen to be identical neither

Opportunities for novel technologies
7.1.
Substrate screening
To better understand the chemistry of a-oxygen and
to estimate its prospects in the oxidation catalysis, a
variety of organic compounds have been tested with
respect to stoichiometric reactions with Oa at room
temperature [107]. The same experimental procedure
was used, as described above for the case of methane
and benzene oxidation. Reaction products were
extracted from the surface and analyzed with GC
and GC/MS techniques. More than 20 substrates were
tested including alkanes, alkenes, arenes and hetero-
cycles. In all cases, a-oxygen oxidation yielded mono-
oxygenated products. Results of this study will be
published in detail in [107]. Just to give few examples,
further we will brieÂ¯y describe the results for the
oxidation of some benzene derivatives, i.e. alkylaro-
matics. These substrates offer opportunity to follow
the competition between hydroxylation of aliphatic
and aromatic carbons, as well as the balance of
electronic and steric factors inÂ¯uencing these trans-
formations.
Interaction
of
toluene
with
a-oxygen
leads
to products of both benzylic and aromatic hydroxy-
lation:
Amount of the latter products is 2.6 times more than
the former. Para-cresol accounts for over 50% of the
aromatic hydroxylation products. It is interesting to
note that meta-cresol is formed in approximately the
same quantity as the ortho-isomer. This result is rather
unusual and presents evidence of the enhanced steric
effect of the methyl group placed in the conÂ®ned space
of a zeolite channel.
The oxidation of ethylbenzene and isopropylben-
zene shows that a slight increase in the bulk of
the substituent strongly suppresses hydroxylation of
both
ortho-
and
meta-positions.
For
isopropyl-
benzene, formation of only para-isopropylphenol is
observed, whose concentration is nearly four times
higher compared to the products of side chain hydro-
xylation:

Isopropylbenzene with its benzylic CÂ±H bond being
very susceptible to oxidation, presents an especially
interesting case for the chain hydroxylation. It is
known that liquid-phase reaction with dioxygen leads
to oxidation of only this particular bond resulting in
the formation of cumene hydroperoxide. This is one of
the three stages for phenol manufacture by the cumene
method. Unlike that, a-oxygen provides also the
oxidation of primary carbon atoms of the isopropyl
substituent, yielding two times higher concentration of
the primary alcohol compared to the tertiary one
Eq. (22). This unusual result can be explained by
the severely hindered access to benzylic position of
isopropylbenzene placed into the micropore space of
ZSM-5 matrix.
Data on substrate screening indicate a remarkable
opportunities of a-oxygen chemistry for organic
synthesis. They also show one other aspect of simila-
rities between a-oxygen and MMO: both can oxidize a
wide variety of substrates leading to monooxygenated
products.
7.2.
New process for direct oxidation of benzene to
phenol
Introduction of hydroxy-function into the aromatic
ring to manufacture phenols, naphthols, hydroxy-
acids, hydroxy-amines, etc. is one of the most difÂ®cult
problems of commodity and speciality chemicals
industry. As noted above, the simplest reaction of this
type, i.e. oxidation of benzene to phenol is carried out
via the three-stage cumene process. In addition to
being technologically complex, this process produces
an equimolar amount of acetone, the demand for
which is unstable and does not match the demand
for phenol. Many methods were suggested for direct
oxidation of benzene to phenol but none of them has
been proven commercially viable because of low
selectivity. That is why an efÂ®cient single-step phenol
synthesis is named among the top challenges of the
modern chemistry [108,109].
Starting from the work by M. Iwamoto et al. [23],
which was the Â®rst to demonstrate the oxidation of
benzene to phenol by nitrous oxide (reaction 18), there
was a considerable interest to this reaction. Even-
tually,
in
1998,
three
groups
of
researchers
[63,110,111] independently discovered ZSM-5 zeo-
lites to be much superior catalysts compared to the
original V2O5/SiO2 system. (For a review, see [54].) In
1994, Monsanto company and Boreskov Institute of
Catalysis (BIC) created a joint R & D group to pursue
the development of commercial process based on this
reaction using Fe-containing ZSM-5 zeolites as cata-
lysts. Besides promising a-oxygen chemistry, these
efforts were also prompted by the following consid-
eration.
Monsanto being one of the largest producers of
adipic acid, faces the problem of abatement of
nitrous oxide which is a by-product of this process
and which is considered to be a greenhouse and
ozone-depleting gas [112]. The idea suggested by
Solutia was to use waste N2O for the oxidation of
benzene to phenol incorporating the latter process
as a key step in the modiÂ®ed scheme of adipic acid
manufacture:
G.I. Panov et al. / Catalysis Today 41 (1998) 365Â±385
381
According to this scheme, the phenol obtained from
benzene oxidation would be hydrogenated to cyclo-
hexanone using available technology. The Â®nal step is
the currently practiced nitric acid oxidation of cyclo-
hexanol and cyclohexanone, which returns N2O for
use in the front end of the process, thus closing the
N2O cycle.
The selectivity of the zeolite catalyst for conversion
of benzene to phenol turned out to be remarkably
insensitive to the reaction temperature. It allows to
perform the process in a simple adiabatic reactor,
which strongly increased its economic advantages.
Recently, based on successful pilot plant operation,
Solutia made an announcement of the jointly devel-
oped new process and shared its plans for fast-track
commercialization [113]. Typical performance data
from the Pensacola pilot plant are given in Table 7.
More details about this process can be found in [114].
The new phenol process has an attractive ecological
aspect. The most common way to reduce damage
caused by our technical activity is to neutralize the
waste, i.e. to convert it into a less harmful form before
dispersing in the environment. The living nature fol-
lows a much more superior strategy, which does not
allow wastes. It uses a by-product of one process as a
starting material for another, thus creating a universal
wasteless cycle comprising innumerable biochemical
transformations. By turning waste N2O into a valuable
raw material, the new process presents a rare example
of a man-made technology following the strategy
suggested by nature. Undoubtedly, in the future, the
ecological concern will more and more force us to
change our mentality in favor of this sustainable
concept.
Speaking of the practical side, the simplicity, safety,
ecological friendliness and high efÂ®ciency provide
this process with remarkable advantages. Hopefully,
even with N2O on-purpose manufacturing, it can
successfully compete with the cumene method.

Conclusion
Creation of catalytic systems capable of generating
oxygen species suitable for partial oxidation is a
difÂ®cult problem. When striving for oxygen activa-
tion, one frequently faces a notorious alternative:
either activity or selectivity. This alternative originates
from the fact that surface oxygen species exhibiting
high activity are not selective, and vice versa, selective
species are not active enough. Thanks to enzyme
monooxygenases, nature managed to successfully
combine both high activity and high selectivity. The
oxygen species of MOs are active enough to oxidize a
variety of hydrocarbons at ambient conditions, and at
the same time exhibit a high selectivity. This fuels the
chemists' drive to understand and to mimic chemically
such an efÂ®cient oxygen activation.
With this regard, the remarkable ability of inorganic
iron complexes in the ZSM-5 matrix to generate a-
oxygen species is of great interest. a-Oxygen shows in
several lines a distinct similarity to the oxygen of
MMO, including its activity, selectivity, and the oxi-
dation mechanism. This allows one to consider the
FeZSM-5Â±N2O system as a new model successfully
mimicking biological oxidation.
Encapsulation of iron complexes inside a rigid
zeolite matrix provides outstanding opportunities
for the practical application of this biomimetic model.
A new process of direct oxidation of benzene to
phenol, developed jointly by Solutia and BIC, is an
example of practical potential of the a-oxygen chem-
istry.
It should be noted that the high selectivity of the
latter process is provided not only by the features of a-
oxygen, but also by the structure of the ZSM-5
micropore space. It is known that the high selectivity
of both biological systems and their biomimetic mod-
els to a large extent is related to steric restrictions
around the active sites [115,116]. In our case the

transport of the reagents to the active sites proceeds
through the zeolite microchannels with ca 5.5 A
ÃŠ dia-
meter, which greatly contributes to the selectivity [69].
Indeed, after the interaction with a-oxygen has
occurred, no further oxidation of the molecule is
possible at this particular a-site. The oxidized mole-
cule has to desorb and to travel away from the channel
to free the way for the N2O molecule which should
reload the site with a-oxygen for a new catalytic cycle.
The temperature range in which this mechanism allows
to preserve the high selectivity is surprisingly wide.
For the oxidation of benzene to phenol, the range is
from room temperature to 6008C. Some analogs of
ZSM-5 zeolite, i.e, ferrosilicates [60], borosilicates
[117] and gallosilicates [118] were found to be also
efÂ®cient in the oxidation of benzene to phenol.
The presence of a zeolite matrix also poses some
limitations for the oxidation catalysis [119]. Room
temperature screening of substrates for their stoichio-
metric reactions on FeZSM-5 surface revealed a great
prospects of a-oxygen for the oxidation organic synth-
esis. To perform these reactions in the catalytic way,
one needs to remove the products from the zeolite
surface, which can be a difÂ®cult problem, especially in
case of complex compounds. It is not always enough
(as in case of phenol) to raise the temperature to assist
desorption into the gas phase. Due to a wealth of
various functional groups available on the zeolite
surface, it may lead to secondary transformations
resulting in degradation of the products.
For solving this problem, it would be very promis-
ing to Â®nd the way of neutralizing side functions of the
zeolite matrix, leaving intact a-sites. Chemical mod-
iÂ®cation of zeolites seems to be one of the most helpful
ways. Presently, this technique is well developed and
allows Â®ne-tuning such important zeolite characteris-
tics as chemical composition of external and internal
surfaces, acidity, porosity, shape selectivity, etc. [120].
This may considerably improve catalytic occurrence
of the oxidation reactions and increase the opportunity
for realization of remarkable a-oxygen chemistry in
practice.
