Abstract
The structure−reactivity relationship for the catalytic performance of cationic oxygen- and sulfur-containing Ga clusters in high-silica zeolite in ethane dehydrogenation is derived from the results of DFT calculations. Computed Gibbs free energy changes for the active site regeneration step via H2 desorption are used as a reactivity descriptor that reflects strength of the active Lewis acid−base pairs. It is shown that the activation free energies as well as the free energy changes of the initial C−H bond activation and final H2 recombination elementary steps of the catalytic cycle scale linearly with the values of free energy change of the active site regeneration. The energetics of the intermediate step involving alkene desorption via β-C−H cleavage does not apparently depend on the properties of the active site. The relationship obtained points to the optimum composition and structure of the intrazeolite Ga cluster for the catalytic dehydrogenation of light alkanes.

A significant advance in catalysis is the formulation of structure−reactivity relationships that enable prediction of the rate of catalytic reaction as a function of the value of a reactivity descriptor. In transition metal catalysis, this has been very elegantly demonstrated by the Nørskov school. (1, 2) Comprehensive theoretical studies of mechanisms of activation of small molecules on transition-metal surfaces allowed appropriate reactivity descriptors to be defined. This ultimately led to the development of novel efficient catalytic systems. (2)
Theoretical study of such complex heterogeneous catalytic systems as metal oxide or sulfide clusters in contact with a charged inorganic support, as in zeolites, is however more challenging because of the difficulties in describing the composition and structure of the active sites. Multiple reaction steps of different nature involved in the respective catalytic cycles further impedes the search for simple reactivity descriptors.
In this communication, we demonstrate the possibility to also define a single reactivity descriptor for such systems. We present a structure−reactivity relationship of a remarkable predictive power for the catalytic ethane dehydrogenation activity of sulfur- and oxygen-containing gallium clusters stabilized in high-silica zeolite matrix. Ga-containing zeolites are known as efficient catalyst for light alkane dehydrogenation and aromatization. (3) Recent experimental (3-6) and theoretical studies (3, 6-9) have contributed significantly to our understanding of the mechanisms underlying alkane activation over these catalysts. It has been concluded that a rather low but stable catalytic activity of reduced Ga/ZSM-5 zeolites associates with the presence of extra-framework Ga+ cations in the microporous matrix. (4, 5) The initial C−H bond activation proceeds over the Lewis acid−base pair formed by Ga+ ion and an adjacent basic framework oxygen of the zeolite (I + RH → II, Scheme 1). (7a)
Scheme 1
Scheme 1. Possible Catalytic Cycle for Dehydrogenation of Light Alkanes (RH) over a Ga-Containing Active Site in Zeolite
Reactivity of the catalyst can be substantially enhanced via oxidation by either ex situ treatment with N2O (4) or by in situ H2O cofeeding. (6, 8b) Upon oxygenation of Ga+ cations in zeolite matrix, various small Ga-oxo or -hydroxo cationic clusters can be formed. (6, 8) The higher reactivity of such species has been attributed to the increased basicity of the extra-framework oxygen atoms. Another factor is that the oxidation of the Ga-centers from the formal +1 oxidation state to +3 enhances their Lewis acidity.
Besides the initial heterolytic C−H bond activation step, the synergy of the Lewis acid−base properties controls also the last step of the catalytic dehydrogenation cycle that is H2 recombination (III → I + H2, Scheme 1). Increased proton affinity of the basic sites may result in prohibitively high barriers for the regeneration of active species. (7b, 8)
Thus, one expects that for the chosen system a Sabatier-type relationship exists that would point to an optimum strength of the Ga-containing Lewis acid−base pair, which would be strong enough to promote initial C−H activation, and on the other hand, the binding of the resulting reaction intermediates would be moderate to allow the active site regeneration. To establish in more detail the effect of properties of the active sites on their catalytic activity, we carried out a periodic DFT study (10) of C2H6 dehydrogenation over small Ga-containing cationic clusters stabilized in a high-silica mordenite (Figure 1a). It has been previously shown (9a) that the nature of light alkane affects only slightly the computed energetics of the respective elementary reaction steps involved in the dehydrogenation reaction (Scheme 1) over Lewis acidic reduced Ga sites (GaH2+) in high-silica zeolites. Thus, we anticipate that the fundamental trends observed in this work for ethane dehydrogenation reaction may be also applicable to a broader range of light alkanes as the reactants for the catalytic reaction considered.
Figure 1
Figure 1. (a) Structure of high-silica mordenite model (MOR) used in DFT calculations and (b) its 2D representation (the main channel of the MOR is cut along z axis and rolled out). Positions of Al ions are shown as circles. (c−g) Optimized structures of the Ga-containing active complexes (AC) in MOR (only the cationic clusters and the mordenite cation site are shown, while the remaining atoms of the zeolite unit cell are omitted for clarity). Atoms directly involved in ethane activation are denoted with stars.
High-silica mordenite was modeled using a supercell that was constructed by doubling the monoclinic mordenite unit cell along the c axis (see the Supporting Information). The resulting cell contained 48 silicon atoms and 96 oxygens. After optimizing volume and shape, the parameters of the primitive cell were the following: a = b = 13.648 Å, c = 15.015 Å, and γ = 97°.
The extraframework Ga-containing active complexes (AC) were stabilized at the large 8-membered ring on the wall of the mordenite main channel (Figure 1a). To compensate for the positive charge of the extraframework clusters introduced into the zeolite, two or four framework silicon ions at T2 positions of mordenite were substituted with aluminums. The framework Si/Al ratios of the resulting models were 23 (Al1 and Al2, Figure 1b) and 11 (Al1−Al4, Figure 1b), respectively.
The Lewis acid−base properties of the active cluster were modified by varying its chemical composition. Let us first consider [Ga2O2]2+ square-planar cationic complex stabilized at the side-pocket of mordenite (Figure 1c). Such species are predominantly formed upon N2O treatment of the Ga+-containing high-silica zeolites. (8) This structure is characterized by an almost perfect tetrahedral surrounding and as a result high coordinative saturation of both Ga ions in the cation site of mordenite. Another possible active multinuclear complex is the partially hydrogenated [GaO2HGaH]2+ species (Figure 1d) that was also proposed to be formed upon water treatment of the reduced catalyst. (6) The interplay of the sterics of the zeolitic cation site and the hydrogen bond formation between such extraframework complex and the zeolite walls results in a significant coordinative unsaturation of one of the Ga3+ cations (Ga*, Figure 1d) in this structure. These distortions of the coordination surrounding of the Ga* site are expected to enhance its Lewis acidity.
Substitution of the intracluster oxygen anions with sulfur (Figure 1, panels e and f) would lead to less basic proton accepting S-sites adjacent to the metal center. Formation of such species can be expected by reaction of H2S with Ga+ sites in high-silica zeolites by analogy with the formation of oxide and hydroxide clusters upon H2O cofeeding. (6) The geometrical peculiarities and the coordination of Ga3+ centers in the [Ga2S2]2+ and [GaS2HGaH]2+ clusters in mordenite (Figure 1, panels e and f, respectively) closely resemble those in the corresponding oxygenated complexes (see the Supporting Information).
In addition to binuclear sites, formation of oxide clusters with higher degree of aggregation has been proposed for zeolites with relatively low framework Si/Al ratio. (8b) In the present study, we consider four nuclear [Ga4O4]4+ cluster (Figure 1g) as an example of sites with exceptionally high Lewis acidity. Indeed, as follows from the bond-order conservation principle, basicity of the O sites coordinated to three Ga3+ cations in this cluster is rather low. However, the coordinative unsaturation of the on-top Ga* (Figure 1 (g)) atom leads to the substantial increase of its Lewis acidity.
The calculated values of Gibbs free energy (ΔG°823K) for the H2 recombination step were used as the parameter that reflects the overall strength of the active Lewis acid−base pair. It depends on both the affinity of the basic site toward H+ binding (basicity) and the affinity of the metal center to bind anionic species (H−) that is directly related to its Lewis acidity. One also notes that the influence of side-factors such as sterics of the interacting species is minimal for the chosen parameter.
Figure 2a summarizes Gibbs free energy changes (ΔG°823K) calculated at the temperature relevant to the experimental catalytic tests (823K) (4-6) for the elementary reactions steps involved in catalytic C2H6 dehydrogenation cycle (Scheme 1) plotted versus ΔG°823K values of the H2 recombination step. The reactivities of the active complexes considered in the initial C−H activation and final H2 recombination steps (I + C2H6 → II and III → I + H2 in Scheme 1) depend strongly on their structures and chemical composition. In line with the discussion above, the computational results indicate the enhancement of the strength of the Lewis acid−base pairs of the Ga-containing active species confined in the zeolite matrix in the row: [Ga2S2]2+ < [GaS2HGaH]2+ < [Ga2O2]2+ < [GaO2HGaH]2+ < [Ga4O4]4+. The reactivity toward heterolytic C−H cleavage increases in this row, while the energetics for the H2 recombination during the catalytic cycle becomes less favorable (Figure 2a). The respective values of ΔG°823K for the initial C−H activation vary from 168 kJ mol−1 for the binuclear S-containing [Ga2S2]2+ site to −79 kJ mol−1 for the tetrameric [Ga4O4]4+ cluster. The ΔG°823K values computed for the H2 recombination step also cover a wide range of energies from −132 kJ mol−1 for [Ga2S2]2+ to 96 kJ mol−1 for [Ga4O4]4+. Indeed, in the extreme cases, the combination of the low proton affinity of the S2− anions and the high coordinative saturation of the tetrahedral Ga3+ cations in the [Ga2S2]2+ complex results in a low overall strength of the associated Lewis acid−base pair. On the other hand, in spite of the low basicity expected for the tricoordinated oxygen anions in the [Ga4O4]4+ complex, the unfavorable coordination of the on-top Ga* site determines the highest strength of the respective Lewis acid−base pair among the species considered.
Figure 2
Figure 2. (a) Gibbs free energies (ΔG°823K) of elementary reaction steps of C2H6 dehydrogenation and (b) activation Gibbs free energies (ΔG823K#) of the C−H activation and of the H2 recombination step plotted against the respective values of ΔG°823K of H2 recombination.
The reaction Gibbs free energy for the intermediate C2H4 desorption step via β-H elimination (II → III + C2H4, Scheme 1) remains almost constant for all of the structures considered. The average ΔG°823K value for this reaction equals −33 kJ mol−1, while the deviations from this value for different active sites do not exceed 20 kJ mol−1. The apparent absence of correlation (Figure 2a) between the properties of the active species and the computed energetics of the C2H4 desorption is probably due to the similar nature of the rearranging bonds. This is in line with the previous observations of the minor effect of the local surrounding of Ga sites on this reaction step. (7)
Because of the energy conservation during the whole catalytic cycle along with the minor variations of the energetics of the intermediate reaction step (II → III + C2H4), an excellent linearity (R2 = 0.989) is found for the correlation between the reaction Gibbs free energies of the initial C−H activation and that of the H2 desorption elementary steps. Indeed, enhancement of the Lewis acid−base properties of the active site is reflected in the stronger binding of the products of H2 dissociation that hampers its recombination (III → I + H2). Owing to the similar nature of the metal−hydrogen and metal−carbon bonds, the same trend holds for the energetic of the initial heterolytic dissociation of ethane (I + C2H6 → II) over the extra-framework Ga clusters (Figure 2a).
More interesting are the trends found for the activation Gibbs free energies (ΔG823K#, Figure 2b) of the alkane activation (I + C2H6 → II) and H2 recombination steps (III → II + H2). The computed ΔG823K# values scale perfectly linearly with the values of ΔG°823K of the III → II+ H2step (Figure 2b). This finding supports our choice of the latter parameter as the reactivity descriptor for the catalytic system considered. Figure 2b represents a classical example of a Sabatier-type relationship, where the intersection of the lines points to the optimum catalyst. Such an intersection in our case is very close to the values computed for the [HGaO2HGa]2+ active complex, which has been proposed to be formed upon water-promoted light alkane dehydrogenation over reduced Ga/ZSM-5 zeolite. (6) This multinuclear species shows the optimum strength of the active site resulting in the high catalytic activity.
Sulfur S2− anions in the structure of intrazeolite Ga clusters ([Ga2S2]2+ and [GaS2HGaH]2+) are weak proton-accepting sites. This is reflected in the very unfavorable energetics of the initial heterolytic dissociation of C2H6. In contrary low-coordinated Ga* site in [Ga4O4]4+ cluster is strongly acidic. The corresponding reaction intermediate III formed during the catalytic cycle is very stable. Thus, further regeneration of the active site is difficult, resulting in the low overall catalytic performance.
Thus, we conclude that a simple reactivity descriptor that reflects the strength of the Lewis acid−base pair of the active species can be established for the catalytic activity of Ga-containing zeolites in ethane dehydrogenation. Only the initial C−H activation and the catalyst regeneration steps depend on the nature of the active site, whereas the variation of the energetics of the intermediate step involving alkene desorption is only minor. As a result a chemical structure−reactivity relationship can be drawn for this rather complex catalytic system. We however expect that the relationship observed holds only for the systems with similar bonding peculiarities and for the similar classes of chemical reactions.

Abstract
Scheme 1
Scheme 1. Possible Catalytic Cycle for Dehydrogenation of Light Alkanes (RH) over a Ga-Containing Active Site in Zeolite
Figure 1
Figure 1. (a) Structure of high-silica mordenite model (MOR) used in DFT calculations and (b) its 2D representation (the main channel of the MOR is cut along z axis and rolled out). Positions of Al ions are shown as circles. (c−g) Optimized structures of the Ga-containing active complexes (AC) in MOR (only the cationic clusters and the mordenite cation site are shown, while the remaining atoms of the zeolite unit cell are omitted for clarity). Atoms directly involved in ethane activation are denoted with stars.
