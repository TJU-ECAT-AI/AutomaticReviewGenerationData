[3] to yiekl at-

polymerization.

performed in such mvlner eshibits the stoichiometry

, 
verified by measurement of evolved alkane with a calibrated mano- 
meter. We find thaz these supported organozirconium compounds inefG- 
ciently catalyze the isomerization of l-butene to ck- and m-2-bukne 
at 
room temperature. However, high rates of isomerization are realized if the 
supported zirconium akyl compounds are first hydrogenated. This can be 
accomplished under reiatively mild conditions (ZOO 
Torr, 120 “C, 30 mm) 
(Table 1) and results in hydrogenolysis of the two remaining alkyl ligands, 
yielding 2 mol akane/mol 
Zr, as vtied 
by WC 
analysis. T-his stoichio- 
1 
metric observation, and hydrolysis rest&s of others [3:, 
indicate 
that (silica) 
ZrH, (2) is formed. Similar color, reactivity and infrared spectra (Zr-H 
absorptions at 1620 and 2190 cm-l) 
suggest that catalysts formed from 
either zircotium complex are identical. 
The isomerization c2ayst 
system derived from 2 is long lived either 
upon stiding 
or under isome_Tization 
reaction conditions provided that air 
and water are rigorou@ 
excluded. We find that rates of butene isomer&a- 
tion at room temperature are competitive with or faster than rates of other 
known homogeneo-us and heterogeneous olefm isomerization catalysts 17 - 
12 ] ; no cocatalyst is required. (Control experimenk show that silica alone is 
inactive towards oleGn isomerization under these conditions.)

vent. (Experiments with I-tutene (1 atm, 25 “C) shoEed isomerization also 
occurred at an equivalent-rate in the absence of solvent.) Rates of isomeriza- 
tion are sterically controlled, decreasing in the order I-butene > I-hexene > 
allylbenzene > methylenecyclohexane (Table 2). Isomerization of I-butene 
and I-haene 
to their respectke thermodynamic mixtures of o1eEn.s 
occurs 
readily s.t room temperature_ In the isomerization of L-butene ciMmn.s ratios 
of initially formed 2-butenes are larger than the thermodynamic ratio (== 
1: I ), 
suggesting that the cis olefin is kinetically prefed. 
This ratio gradually 
decreases as the reaction proceeds, and eventually achieves the equilibrium 
value. Conversion of l-hexene to ck- and arcs-2hexene 
i.s 
rapid, but sub- 
sequent isomerization to the 3hexene isomers proceeds slowly at roam tem- 
perature and several days ze required for attainment of the equilibrium 
mixture of iinear hexenes under these conditions. Higher isomerization rates 
can be obtain& at higher temperature Indeed, such higher reaction tempera- 
tures (55 “C) are necm 
to effect the isomerization of allylbenzene and 
methylenecyclohexane to cis- and tins-methyls@rene 
and l-metbykyclo- 
herene, respectively, in a convenient time period. It shot-18 be noted ‘that 
although the catalyst described is an effective ethylene polymerization 
catalyst [3], polymerization of these oleefins 
was not observed For example, 
when isomeriza’,ion expekimenk with %(I 
mol of I-butene/mal Zr were per- 
formed, the ‘komerized butenes were recovered in 90 - 95% yield (95% is the 
theoreticEll 
yieid since one equivalent of butene per mol Zr remains bound to 
the meti as an a&y1 &and, vi& infm). 
It would appear that olefin double-bond isomerrtion 
involves the 
intermediacy of alh@Crconium species. The relative rates of isomerization 
noted above probably correlate with the relative stabilities of these inter- 
mediary organozirconium compounds. Et 
is noteworthy chat with methylene- 
cyclohexane isomerization the double-bond isomerization past the terkiary 
center, x&ich reqrkas an intermediary tertiary a&y1 spies,

species followed 
by B-hydride elimination 
to free one equivalent of the olefin 
is implied. 
We propose a mechanism 
to account 
for the catiytic 
activCQ 
shown by supported 
species 4 which involves supported 
dial@1 
species 6 
{reaction 2). According 
to this hypothesis, 
supportt 
zirconium neopentyl 
and ally1 species (1) are inefficient 
isomerization 
catalysts -because they do 
not rediiy 
decompose 
to give hydridic species such as 4. 
Since ‘both 1 [3] <and 
5 [14] 
undergo hydrogenolysis 
readily, it was 
decided to investigate the catalytic hydrogenation 
efficiency 
of 2 towards 
olefins. When a twentyTold molar excess of 1-butene was added to a toluene 
slurry of the catiysr;, hydrogenation 
(He, 1 atzn, 25 “C) to butane was com- 
plete within 30 h. Similarly, 
CCS- 
and tins-2-butene 
can be completely 
hydrogenated 
within two days. Hydrogenation 
of 1-butene is poorly com- 
petitive v&h isomerization 
under OIL’ conditions. 
After 3 h under hydro- 
genation conditions, 
the concentration 
of Bbutenes 
reach= 
a maximum 
(57% of ‘he total hydrocarbon 
present) and then diminishes as the olefins 
are hydrogenated. 
The rest of the mixture 
at this time is comprked 
of 
butane (40%) 
and 1-buterre (3%). 
Catalyst lifetime is shorter under these 
conditions 
than that obse~vc-b in isomerization 
experiments_
