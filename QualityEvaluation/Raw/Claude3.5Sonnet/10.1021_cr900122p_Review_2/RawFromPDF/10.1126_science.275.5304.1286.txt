when photocheml-

here because ~t allows a h ~ g h

Conversion of methaneto higher hydrocarbons by its low-temperatureactivation without 
forming undesirable carbon oxides is of great scientific and practical importance. Meth- 
ane can be highly activated, 
yielding high rates of conversion to higher hydrocarbons and 
aromatics (1 
0 to 45 percent) at low temperatures (400" to 600°C), by its reaction over 
H-galloaluminosilicate ZSM-5 type (MFI) zeolite in the presence of alkenes or higher 
alkanes. 
The methane activation results from its hydrogen-transfer reaction with alkenes. 
Methane, the most inert of hydrocarbons, 
has been extremely difficult to activate for 
direct conversion to higher hydrocarbons. 
In the past 10 to 12 years, some success has 
been achieved by oxidative coupling of 
methane (OCM) to ethane and ethylene 
over a number of basic catalysts in the 
presence or absence of free oxygen (1-4) 
and over pentasil zeolites with nitrous oxide 
as the oxidant (5). 
In the OCM process, the 
selectivity for higher hydrocarbons is high 
only at lovi7 conversion rates. Moreover, this 
process involves formation of undesirable 
products such as C02 
and CO because of 
the highly exothermic hydrocarbon corn- 
bustion reactions, which can also be hazard- 
ous. More recently, a dehydrogenative cou- 
pling of methane to ethane over active 
carbon was reported (6). 
However, the tem- 
perature required for methane activation by 
its dehydrogenative coupling is very high 
( 2 1  
100°C).

Our nevi7 approach for obtaining high 
rates of conversion of methane to higher 
hvdrocarbons. without formation of carbon 
okides and at much lower temperatures 
(400" to 600°C), involves nonoxidative ac- 
tivation of tnethane by hydrogen-transfer 
reactions between methane and alkene over 
H-GaAlMFI zeolite. The zeolite is a bif~~nc- 
tional catalyst with strong acid sites (be- 
cause of the tetrahedral A1 and Ga in the 
zeolite framework) as well as dehydrogena- 
tion functions (because of a combination of 
zeolitic protons and extra framework Ga- 
oxide species). 
To illustrate this approach, we convert- 
ed methane to higher hydrocarbons (or 
arotnatics) over the zeolite through the 
addition of C2 
to C4 alkei~es, 
propane, or 
n-hexane in the feed. The zeolite was pre- 
pared and characterized by procedures 
similar to those in (7). 
Catalytic reactions 
were carried out at ambient pressure in a 
continuous-flow tubular reactor (8, 9). 
The reactor (internal diatneter, 13 mm) 
was made of quartz. A mixture of N2 
(>99.99%), tnethane (99.95%), and al- 
kene or higher alkane (>99.5%) was 
oite at 500'C (concentraton o

passed over the zeolite catalyst (1 g) for a 
period of -5 inin at different feed compo- 
sitions and temperatures. The square pulse 
technique previously described (9) was 
used. The space velocity of the feed gas 
mixtures was ~neasured 
at 0°C and 1 atm. 
The conversion and product selectivity 
data were obtained from the feed and 
product cornposition as follows:

in the feed hydrocarbons) -

alyst) was found to be 5 1

High rates of conversion of methane 
into higher hydrocarbons or aromatics oc- 
cured over the zeolite in the presence of 
alkenes or higher alkanes in the feed (Ta- 
bles 1 and 2 and Figs. 1 and 2). The zeolite 
showed no activity for tnethane conversion 
at 5600°C in the absence of alkenes or 
higher alkanes. However, the addition of 
alkenes or hieher alkanes in the feed in- 
- 
creased methane conversion from 0 to 
%45%, depending on the additive (alkene 
or higher alkane), the additive/CH4 molar 
ratio in the feed, and the temperature. More 
methane conversion occurred at higher ad- 
ditive/CH, ratios (Fig. 1) and at higher 
temperatures (Fig. 2). The selectivity for 
aromatics in the simultaneous arotnatiza- 
tion of methane and alkenes or higher al- 
kanes was also very high. 
Rates of conversion of methane to high- 
er hydrocarbons as high as -45%. without 
formation of carbon Lides, could be ob- 
tained by the addition of isobutene or n- 
butene (Table 1) in the feed. Such a high

low-temperature nonoxidative activation of

The conversion of methane in the presence of 
isobutene over H-ZSM-5 (Si/Al = 13.6) at 
600°C was negligibly small, but its conversion 
over H-ZSM-5 zeolite containing nonfratne- 
work Ga-oxide species (namely, Ga/H-ZSM- 
5) was appreciable. Hence, methane activa- 
tion in the presence of alkene over the H- 
GaAlMFI zeolite is expected to occur over the 
nonfratnework Ga-oxide species (Eq. 4). The 
C-H bond cleavage, however, takes place 
only by the hydride transfer frotn the partially 
activated methane to the carbonium ion (Ey. 
5). The methylinium ion (CH,+) fortned in 
this reaction is rapidly decotnposed (Eq. 6) 
and releases the proton and CH, radical; the 
latter is rapidly dimerized to ethene (Ey. 7). In 
the absence of alkene, no conversion of meth- 
ane over the H-GaAlMFI zeolite was ob- 
served. Therefore, the presence of a carbo- 
niutn ion is essential for the cleavage of the 
C-H bond of methane. 
Because of its very high reactivity, the 
higher alkane formed in Eq. 5 undergoes 
fast dehydrogenation over the zeolite, thus 
regenerating the alkene consumed in the 
hydrogen-transfer reaction:

The methane activation resulting frotn the 
presence of the higher alkane also involves 
the above reactions, but the alkane is first 
converted to alkene by Eq. 
9. 
Because of the very large change in free 
energy (AG, > 48 kcal/mol of benzene) 
that vvould be involved, the direct forma- 
tion of benzene from methane at 5600°C is 
thermodynatnically impossible. However, 
the thermodvnatnic barrier is drastically re- 
duced or eve; elitninated as a result of the 
addition of alkenes or higher alkanes; the 
value of AG, approaches zero or even be- 
cotnes negative, depending on the additive, 
its concentration relative to that of tneth- 
ane, and the temperature. For example, for 
an n-butenelmethane ratio of 1.0, AG, = 
-4.1 kcal/mol at 500°C and -10.6 kcall 
mol at 600°C (1 1 ). 
According to the stoichiometry of Eq. 
8 
(which is responsible for the methane activa- 
tion), the rate of methane conversion should 
increase with an increasing alkene/CH, ratio. 
The results in Fig. 1 are consistent with this 
assumption. Further, the appreciable forma- 
tion of butanes from n-butene, particularly at 
lower temperatures (Fig. 2), and that of pro- 
pane from propene (Fig. I), 
also indicate the 
occurrence of the hydrogen-transfer reaction. 
The observed high methane activation (at 
lower temperature and higher space velocity) 
resulting from the isobutene additive (Table 
" 
1) is consistent with the tert-butyl carbonium 
ions being more stable than the primary and 
secondary butyl carbonium ions. This inter- 
pretation also supports the involvement of 
carbonium ions in the methane activation by

aromatization in the presence of methane 
with that in the absence of methane (Table 
2) shows a marked increase in H2

tion in the reaction when methane ts

sion values estimated from the feed and 
product compositions are quite close to that 
obtained directly from the methane flow 
measured at the inlet and outlet of the 
reactor. Also, in general, there is a small but 
appreciable increase in the selectivity for 
aromatics because of the presence of meth- 
ane (Table 2). All of these observations

Dissociation of Methane into Hydrocarbons at 
Extreme (Planetary) Pressure and Temperature 
F. Ancilotto, G. L. Chiarotti,* S. Scandolo, E. Tosatti 
Constant-pressure, first-principles molecular dynamic simulations were used to in- 
vestigate the behavior of methane at high pressure and temperature. Contrary to the 
current interpretation of shock-wave experiments, the simulations suggest that, below 
100 
gigapascals, methane dissociates into a mixture of hydrocarbons, 
and it separates 
into hydrogen and carbon only above 300 gigapascals. The simulation conditions (1 
00 
to 300 gigapascals; 4000 to 5000 kelvin) were chosen to follow the isentrope in the 
middle ice layers of Neptune and Uranus, Implications 
on the physics of these planets 
are discussed. 
T h e  
high-pressure and high-temperature be- 
havior of methane (CH,), the most abundant 
organic molecule in the universe, is of great 
importance in planetary physics. Current 
models ( I ,  2) of the interiors of Neptune and 
Uranus are based on the existence of a middle 
ice layer made of CH4, 
NH,, and H 2 0  
in solar 
proportions. In this layer, pressure and tem- 
perature (P-T) 
range from 20 GPa and 2000 K 
to 600 GPa and 8000 K. Shock-wave experi- 
ments indicate that, in spite of its stability at 
ambient conditions (3), CH, dissociates at 
these extreme conditions (4), 
possibly into H2 
and carbon, with precipitation of solid dia- 
mond (5). 
Here we present computer simula- 
tions that show a different, more complex, 
chemical breakdown. 
The lack of direct information on the 
interior structure of Neptune and Uranus 
has restricted attempts to understand the 
behavior of CH, under extreme pressures to 
the 
interpretation 
of 
laboratory-based 
shock-wave experiments (4), 
where plane- 
tary P-T 
conditions are achieved. An alter- 
native tool for such an investigation is com- 
puter simulation (6). Our simulations are 
based on a recentlv develoved deformable-
