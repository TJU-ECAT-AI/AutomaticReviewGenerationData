A DRIFTS study of ethane adsorption by the univalent copper cations in Cu(I)-ZSM-5 zeolite prepared by
chemical reaction of the corresponding hydrogen form (Si/Al ¼ 150) with CuCl vapour at 573 K reveals an
unusual spectrum of adsorbed C2H6. In addition to the weakly perturbed narrow bands in the region of C–H
stretching vibrations, the spectrum exhibits two broad IR bands whose frequencies are lowered more than by
300 cm1 compared to the C–H stretching vibrations of gaseous or physically adsorbed ethane. This indicates
unusually strong perturbation of adsorbed C2H6 molecules by Cu1 ions, which has never been observed before
for ethane adsorption on oxides or on any other cationic form of zeolites. Despite such a strong perturbation, the
adsorbed ethane molecules are not involved in heterolytic dissociative adsorption at elevated temperatures. DFT
cluster modeling of ethane interaction with Cu1 stabilized at a-sites (the six-membered ring composed of two
ﬁve-membered rings from the straight wall of the ZSM-5 zeolite) as possible adsorption sites indicated that C2H6
interaction with Cu1 results in formation of rather strong s-type adsorption complexes. The results obtained
indicated that the most preferential adsorption geometry is when the alkane bound in an end-on fashion through
two hydrogen atoms of one of the methyl groups. The nature of such bonding can be reasonably described by the
synergetic combination of the ligand-to-metal donation from the s(C–H) orbitals of ethane to the low-occupied
Cu1 s-orbital with the metal-to-ligand back donation from the copper dp orbital to the C–H s*-orbitals. Both
these interactions result in a very strong weakening of the C–H bonds and, therefore, in a very large
bathochromic shift of the C–H stretching frequencies of methyl group contacting with Cu1 ion.
Introduction
Copper-exchanged ZSM-5 zeolite (CuZSM-5) is known to
exhibit a high catalytic activity in the selective decomposition
of NO into molecular oxygen and nitrogen.1–3 This system also
exhibits very unusual adsorption properties resulting in for-
mation of very strong adsorption complexes of the univalent
copper with N2,4,5 or CO.6 The copper adsorption centers
could be formed both in an indirect way after reduction of
dimeric oxygen-bridged [Cu–O–Cu]21 species or directly by
high-temperature reaction of the hydrogen form with the CuCl
vapour at elevated temperature.4–8 The quantum chemical
calculations9–11 demonstrated, that such unusual properties
of reduced CuZSM-5 can be related to the electron donor
properties of Cu1 species, which, in turn, call forth very strong
activation of adsorbed molecules.
Recently, another very unusual adsorption property of
CuZSM-5 zeolites has been reported by Serykh and Kazansky
in refs. 12 and 13. They found that adsorption of dihydrogen
by the reduced over-exchanged CuZSM-5 results in more than
1000 cm1 low-frequency shift of the H–H stretching vibration,
which has never been observed before for H2 adsorbed by any
other cationic forms of zeolites or by oxides.
On the other hand, during the last 20 years a great number of
compounds have been reported for oxidative addition of H2 to
transition metal complexes which contain intact molecular
dihydrogen.14–22 These systems constitute a special class of
s-bond complexes. The vibrational properties of the M–H2
moiety in these systems15–17,20 are very similar to those ob-
served in the case of H2 adsorption by CuZSM-5 zeolite in refs.
12 and 13. Most likely, the bonding of adsorbed H2 with Cu1
cations could be reasonable described in the similar way as in
the above mentioned hydrogen transition metal complexes.
Indeed, analysis of the components of the adsorption energy of
H2 by Cu1 cations, carried out within the cluster approach by
Solans-Monfort et al.,23 revealed the s-bonding of adsorbed
hydrogen. In this case the electron donation from the H2(sg)
bonding orbital to the partially occupied Cu(4s) orbital com-
bined with the electron back-donation from the (3dp) Cu1
orbital to the antibonding H2(s*
u) orbital and also the orbital
polarization play a signiﬁcant role in the H2 adsorption energy,
and cause the above mentioned very large bathochromic H–H
frequency shift.
Our recent investigations of hydrogen or light alkanes
adsorption by diﬀerent cationic forms of zeolites24–29 showed
that the ion exchanged transition metal cations usually exhibit
very similar adsorption properties both with respect to H2 and
to light paraﬃn adsorption (see for instance refs. 26 and 28).
However, most of these works were aimed on the interaction
of adsorbed molecules with the strong Lewis acids when no
s-type complexes were formed upon adsorption.
Although many H2 s-complexes have been previously re-
ported, no similar series of the stable complexes with transition
metals have been obtained for light alkanes.30,31 All the alkane
complexes so far detected are unstable at room temperature
and rather specialized methods are required for their prepara-
tion and detection. Indeed, the ﬁrst examples of alkane co-
ordination by transition metals were reported for application
of the matrix isolation technique in the photochemistry of the
d6 M(CO)6 carbonyls (M ¼ Cr, Mo, W).32,33 The coordination
of alkanes to the M(CO)5 fragment has also been observed by
the transient absorption technique in solution and in the gas
phase in refs. 34–36. More recently, the coordination of
methane by naked transition metal atoms has been directly
observed in the low temperature matrices. Experiments on the
oxidative addition and reductive elimination of alkanes from

transition metal complexes have also revealed the formation of
alkane complexes as reaction intermediates.31,37 The complexes
with light alkanes have been also subjected to theoretical
calculations in refs. 31 and 38, both as intermediates in C–H
activation, or as independent entities. Many examples of
intramolecular agostic complexes have been reported either
for transition metal complexes containing long-chain alkyl
ligands31 or for saturated hydrocarbons grafted to transition
metal oxides.39
In the present study we report the results of the combined
DRIFTS and DFT study of ethane adsorption by Cu(I)-ZSM-
5 zeolite. The interest in Cu1 as a compensating ion in zeolite
framework is ﬁrstly connected with its ability to form the very
unusual s-type adsorption complexes with hydrogen and,
secondly, with its high aﬃnity to light alkanes. As shown by
the gas-phase DFT calculations, CH4–Cu1 binding energy is
equal to 16.8–21.43 kcal mol1.40 This is signiﬁcantly larger
than that for the other cations, such as Li1 (8.2 kcal mol1)38
or Mg21 (7.6 kcal mol1).41
Experimental
The SN-300 ZSM-5 zeolite from ‘‘Alsi Penta’’ with an Si/Al
ratio in the framework of about 150 was prepared by decom-
position of the corresponding ammonium form in ﬂowing
oxygen at 773 K. A high Si/Al ratio was actually chosen in
order to minimize the interaction between copper species inside
the zeolite channels after completion of the exchange reaction.
By the analogy with the procedure previously described in
ref. 8, the Cu(I)-ZSM-5 sample was prepared directly by
reaction of HZSM-5 with the CuCl vapour at 573 K. This
was done in the same quartz optical cell that was subsequently
used for recordings of DRIFT spectra. For this purpose the cell
was equipped with a side-arm with CaF2 window and an
appendix, containing CuCl (Merck), previously outgassed at
473 K in order to remove any traces of water. At ﬁrst, the
zeolite was heated in vacuum at 393 K for 2 h with the rate of
preliminary temperature increase of 2 K min1. Then the
temperature was raised to 773 K with the same heating rate
and the sample was evacuated for 2 h more at this temperature.
Subsequently HZSM-5 was transferred to the appendix with
CuCl and then heated at 573 K in vacuum. At the end of HCl
evolution the modiﬁed zeolite was transferred into the main
part of the quartz cell and heated in vacuum at 773 K for 2 h
more to remove the excess of copper chloride.
Similar to our previous publications, DRIFT spectra of the
granulated zeolite with dimensions of grains of 0.5–1 mm were
measured using a Nicolet ‘‘Impact 410’’ spectrophotometer
equipped with a home-made diﬀuse reﬂectance attachment.
The spectra were recorded at room temperature trough the
CaF2 window. All spectra were transformed into Kubelka–
Munk units by a standard program assuming that the reﬂec-
tance ability of the samples at 5000 cm1 was equal to 0.9.
Then the background created by the zeolite was subtracted
from the overall spectra.
Ethane was puriﬁed by a triple vacuum distillation after
freezing at liquid nitrogen temperature. Adsorption of ethane
was carried out at room temperature at diﬀerent equilibrium
pressures. DRIFT measurements were performed both in
presence and in absence of C2H6 over the sample.
The quantum chemical calculations were carried out within
the gradient-corrected density functional theory (DFT) using
the GAUSSIAN-98 program.42 The hybrid B3LYP43 func-
tional was used, since it gives acceptable values for molecular
energies and geometries.44 All of the calculations were per-
formed using a standard 6-31G(d,p) basis set for all atoms of
the cluster and of adsorbed ethane species.
As a possible site for Cu1 localization the six-membered ring
composed of two ﬁve-membered rings on the walls of the
straight channels of the ZSM-5 zeolite (the a-site) was chosen.
Localization of Cu1 at this site has been suggested since it has
been proposed by experimentalists45 to explain unusual cata-
lytic and chemical properties of high-silica zeolites. Also,
Nachtigallova et al.46 have shown theoretically using the
QM-pot approach that this site is among the most stable.
The CuAlSi6O8H*12 cluster shown in Fig. 1 was chosen for our
model DFT calculations. Below this structure will be desig-
nated as Cu1Z. Hydrogen atoms (H*) were used to saturate
the dangling Si–O bonds at the border of the cluster. The
starting geometry of the cluster corresponds to the real lattice
of the ZSM-5 zeolite detected by XRD data.47
By analogy with ref. 48, special restrictions were imposed on
the procedure of optimization of the positions of the boundary
H* atoms. At ﬁrst the structure of the initial zeolite cluster was
constrained according to X-ray diﬀraction data.47 Then only
Si–H* and Al–H* bond lengths and position of the copper ion
were optimized, whereas positions of other atoms as well as
directions of these bonds were ﬁxed according to crystallo-
graphic data while the Cu1 ion was allowed to move in the
structure freely. The positions of H* atoms in all subsequent
calculations were then ﬁxed, while the positions of the remain-
ing atoms of the cluster were optimized.
ZPE-corrected C2H6 adsorption energies were calculated
with eqn. (1) while correction for BSSE was not performed
due to the very signiﬁcant changes of the optimized cluster
geometry after ethane adsorption.

To investigate the orbital distribution of electrons and energies
of donor–acceptor interactions in the ethane adsorption com-
plexes with Cu1 ions, the population analysis was performed
using the natural bond orbital method that has been imple-
mented in the GAUSSIAN-98 program package. According to
ref. 49 this method allows a rather reasonable description of
diﬀerent types of interatomic interactions and determination of
their types, as well as of the orbital populations and orbital
energies.
Results and discussion
Fig. 2 shows DRIFT spectra of ethane adsorbed by Cu(I) at
relatively high equilibrium pressures. They contain the follow-
ing DRIFT bands: the strong narrow bands at 2974, 2941,
2920 and 2882 cm1; the very weak band at 2738 cm1; and
two weak broad bands with the maxima at 2642 and 2584
cm1. The former four bands are similar to those previously
observed by us in the case of ethane adsorption by the
hydrogen form of ZSM-5 zeolite or of the weak physical
adsorption by ZnZSM-5.28 Therefore, by analogy with that

work we ascribe these bands to the weakly perturbed C2H6
molecules inside the zeolite channels.
One can also see from comparison of the spectra in Fig. 2(a)
and (b) that upon lowering of ethane pressure, the intensities of
the bands at 2642 and 2584 cm1 changed very slightly. At the
same time, the high frequency bands from the weakly per-
turbed ethane very strongly decreased and, instead, several
slightly shifted new narrow bands with the maxima at 2989,
2949 and 2892 cm1 become apparent. Thus, the overall
DRIFT spectra in Fig. 2(a) and (b) correspond to superposi-
tion of at least two diﬀerent forms of ethane adsorption. The
simultaneous decreasing in intensities of the bands at 2989,
2949 and 2892 cm1 with those of the low frequency bands at
2642 and 2584 cm1 shows that all of them belong to the same
form of ethane adsorption by the univalent copper cations.
This form predominates at low pressure and, most likely, the
dotted line in Fig. 2(b) represents the DRIFT spectra of C–H
stretching vibrations of ethane speciﬁcally adsorbed by Cu1
cations.
The appearance of the very strongly red shifted bands in the
concerned spectra is the most striking. Recently we also
observed the similar very strong bathochromic shift by more
than 220 cm1 for n1 C–H stretching vibrations in DRIFT
spectrum of ethane adsorbed by the zinc-modiﬁed ZSM-5
zeolite.28 However, in that case adsorption of C2H6 molecules
by the low-coordinated Zn21 cations resulted in enormously
high intensity of this band in comparison with the other bands
from the C–H stretching vibrations. It was suggested, that this
eﬀect resulted from the selective polarization of the corres-
ponding C–H vibrational mode that, in turn, led to heterolytic
dissociation of adsorbed ethane molecules at elevated tempera-
tures.
In contrast, as one can see from Fig. 2(b), we did not observe
the similar eﬀect for ethane adsorption by Cu(I)–ZSM-5 zeo-
lite. Indeed, despite the value of the low-frequency shift of the
mostly perturbed C–H stretching bands at 2582 and 2639 cm1
in this case is even higher than for ethane adsorption by the
zinc-modiﬁed ZSM-5, their intensities are comparable with the
weakly perturbed bands at 2892, 2949 and 2989 cm1. In
addition, the heating of the copper modiﬁed sample in ethane
atmosphere at elevated temperature up to 673 K did not result
in dissociative adsorption. Instead such treatment resulted in
the strong darkening of the sample that testiﬁed reduction of
Cu1 cations into copper metal, which made the further DRIFT
study of the zeolite impossible.
These results and the lower polarizing ability of Cu1 cations
as against Zn21 cations with the only partially compensated
positive charge26 indicate that the unusually strong perturba-
tion of ethane by interaction with univalent copper cations has
diﬀerent nature than that suggested for ZnZSM-5 zeolite.
Therefore, it is not connected with the polarization of adsorbed
C2H6 molecules, but should be explained by some diﬀerent
reasons.
As was already mentioned above, adsorption of dihydrogen
by the reduced CuZSM-5 zeolites results in formation of a
rather strong s-type [Cu1(Z2-H2)]Z complexes. (By an Zn
structure, we mean that n is the number of hydrogen atoms
bonded to the cation). It was also concluded in ref. 23 that the
binding in these complexes of hydrogen results from a combi-
nation of the ligand-to-metal electron donation from H2 s-
orbital to the vacant Cu1 s-orbital combined with the metal-to-
ligand back donation from the copper dp-orbital to the H2
s*-orbital. Both of these interactions lead to a very marked
weakening of the H–H bond and, therefore, explain a very
strong red shift of the corresponding vibration.
In the similar way we can suggest that unusually strong
perturbation of ethane adsorbed by Cu1 cations could be also
explained with formation of the similar s-complexes of Cu1
ions with adsorbed C2H6. In this case the value of the red shift
of the C–H stretching frequency is, however, much less than
that one for hydrogen adsorption. This diﬀerence may be
connected with the lower basicity of the C–H s-bond due to
the higher electronegativity of C in comparison with H atom
and also in the steric hindrances for the back-donation from
the carbon lobe of the C–H s* complex resulting from the side-
on binding that is possible for H2 but is more diﬃcult for C2H6.
In this connection, it is possible to propose two following Z1
and Z2 alternative structures for ethane adsorption by Cu1
ions: (Fig. 3). The Z3 structure is not considered since due to
only partial removal of degeneration of C–H stretching vibra-
tions for the C3v geometry, the DRIFT spectrum should
contain in a contradiction with the experiment only four IR
bands. In contrast, formation of both Z1 and Z2 complexes
should result in the stronger lowering of the symmetry of
adsorbed ethane from D3d to Cs. One can also suggest that
for the Z1 structure the electron donation from s C–H orbital
to the partially occupied copper s-orbital should be less
eﬀective due to much lower overlap of the corresponding
orbitals. Therefore, the Z2 structure may be favoured.
These hypotheses were tested by the DFT modeling of C2H6
adsorption by the Cu1Z cluster that is shown in Fig. 1. The
optimized Cu–O bond lengths are summarized in Table 1. As
could be expected, the copper cation is localized more closely
to the Al atom. Therefore, despite the eﬀective coordination
number of Cu1 by the zeolitic oxygen atoms equal to 3, the
bond lengths with the two oxygen atoms adjacent to aluminum
are somewhat shorter than the third one. These results reason-
ably well agree with those previously reported by Nachtigallo-
va et al. in ref. 46 for Cu1 stabilized at the cationic site with the
similar geometry as for the cluster used in the present work.
Adsorption of C2H6 can take place at the Cu1Z site both in
Z1 and Z2 geometries. As proof of the above discussion, Z3
adsorption is not realized, as geometry optimization evolved to
the formation of [Cu1(Z2-C2H6)]Z complex. The obtained opti-
mized structures of [Cu1(Z1-C2H6)]Z and [Cu1(Z2-C2H6)]Z

complexes are shown in Fig. 3(a) and (b), respectively, while
Table 2 documents the C2H6 adsorption energies, the calculated
frequencies of C–H stretching vibrations and interatomic dis-
tances of the Cu–C2H6 moiety. The obtained values of the
adsorption energies for the Z1 and Z2 structures are equal to
15.04 and 22.75 kcal mol1, respectively. These values are quite
reasonable for the s-alkane–transition metal complexes recently
discussed in literature.29,30,38 One can also emphasize that for-
mation of the Z2 adsorption complex leads to the very signiﬁcant
changes in the geometry of the adsorption site: the Cu1 ion
partially leaves the cationic site while its coordination number to
the lattice oxygen atoms becomes equal to 2. On the other hand,
formation of the Z1-complex results in only slight increase of the
Cu–O bond lengths (Table 1).
The computed adsorption energy for the Z2 structure is by
about 8 kcal mol1 higher than for the Z1 complex. Interaction
of two C–H bonds with the Cu1 cation also leads to the much
stronger changes in geometry of the corresponding methyl
group and, therefore, results in very strong low-frequency
shifts of the corresponding C–H stretching vibrations. The
larger shift corresponds to symmetric C–H vibrations, while
the lower shift to the asymmetric one. For both adsorption
complexes the C–H bonds involved in the bonding with the
Cu1 ions are considerably longer in comparison with the same
values calculated for the free C2H6 molecule, while the rest of
C–H bonds of adsorbed ethane are perturbed insigniﬁcantly.
These results of theoretical calculations are in a reasonably
good agreement with the above discussed experimental data.
Indeed, as follows from Table 2, the calculated C–H stretching
frequencies for [Cu1(Z2-C2H6)]Z adsorption complexes are
close to those experimentally observed in the obtained DRIFT
spectra. This conﬁrms that the dotted line in Fig. 2(b) corres-
ponds to the spectrum of ethane adsorption complexes with the
Z2 geometry. The very weak band at 2734 cm1 could be then
ascribed to the Z1 adsorption complexes, with the lower
adsorption energy.
One can see that both the experimental results and theore-
tical calculations show that adsorption of ethane by Cu(I)-
ZSM-5 results in a very strong perturbation of two C–H
stretching vibrations of adsorbed molecules. However, unlike
ethane adsorption by ZnZSM-5, the heating of the copper
modiﬁed sample in the ethane atmosphere at the temperatures
up to 673 K does not result in heterolytic dissociative

adsorption. This fact is quite surprising, since the red shifts of
the C–H stretching bands are much higher than for C2H6
adsorption by ZnZSM-5, which is involved in heterolytic
dissociation at the moderately high temperatures.
To clarify the nature of the unusually strong perturbation of
ethane by isolated Cu1 ions at a-sites, we also performed the
NBO analysis for the [Cu1(Zn-C2H6)]Z (n ¼ 1,2) adsorption
complexes. The obtained orbital populations and energies of
the donor–acceptor interactions between C2H6 and Cu1 are
summarized in Table 3.
One can see that for the Z1 adsorption mode the overlap of
the low-occupied Cu1 s-orbital with C–H s orbital of ethane is
very strongly inﬂuenced by the steric factors. Therefore, the
ligand-to-metal donation is very weak (Edon ¼ 4.5 kcal mol1)
and the strongest interaction in this case is the metal-to-ligand
back donation from copper ds and s orbitals to the s* C–H
orbital (Eback ¼ 16.5 kcal) (Fig. 4(a)). On the other hand, for
[Cu1(Z2-C2H6)]Z adsorption complexes both types of the
ligand–metal interactions are much stronger (Eback ¼ 18.5 kcal
mol1 and Edon ¼ 32.5 kcal mol1) and the ethane bonding
with Cu1 could be reasonably described in the same way as for
[Cu1(Z2-H2)]Z complexes, i.e. by a synergetic combination of
the ligand-to-metal electron donation from C–H s orbitals to
the low-occupied Cu1 s-orbital combined with metal-to-ligand
back-donation from copper dp-orbitals to the C–H s* orbitals
(Fig. 4(b)). Obviously, each component of such interaction
with univalent copper for both Z1- and Z2-C2H6 complexes
results in a very strong weakening of the C–H bonds contacting
the copper ion. However, only formation of the Z2 adsorption
complex results in an unusually strong red shift of the C–H
stretching IR bands of adsorbed ethane, since both the dona-
tion and the back-donation in this case are much more
eﬀective.
On the other hand, the absence of heterolytic dissociative
adsorption of ethane at elevated temperatures could be ex-
plained in the following way. Indeed, the interaction of C2H6
with Cu1 resulting in a very strong weakening of the C–H
bonds due to electron donation to the univalent copper.
Usually such interactions lead to full oxidative addition of
the hydrocarbon to the transition metal.31 However, for copper
this process seems to be improbable, since formation of the
species containing trivalent copper is very exotic. On the other
hand, the studied C2H6/Cu(I)-ZSM-5 system does not contain
any nucleophilic reagent or surface species, which are able to
react with the activated C–H bonds. These conclusions should
be, however, veriﬁed by our future investigations.
Due to the very low stability, transition metal complexes
with light alkanes have been earlier reported only for very
speciﬁc conditions such as matrix isolation, laser ﬂash photo-
lysis or as an intermediates in the reactions of oxidative
addition or reductive elimination. The present study shows
that the zeolite matrix can play a role of the stabilizing agent in
formation of the s-ethane complexes with Cu1. It could be
considered as the ﬁrst direct DRIFTS study of s-type donor–
acceptor alkane transition metal complexes.
Conclusion
Ethane is adsorbed by Cu(I)-ZSM-5 at room temperature in at
least two diﬀerent forms. The ﬁrst of them does not exhibit any
signiﬁcant perturbation of adsorbed molecules. DRIFT spec-
trum of C2H6 adsorbed in this way is similar to that one for
ethane adsorption by HZSM-5.
The second form of molecular ethane adsorption occurs on
the isolated Cu1 ions stabilized in the ZSM-5 lattice at a-sites.
This form is much stronger, but is still reversible at room
temperature. The most exciting feature of this form of adsorp-
tion is a very strong perturbation of adsorbed molecules due to
interaction with Cu1 cations that is evident from appearance in
the DRIFT spectra of the very strongly red shifted C–H
stretching bands at 2642 and 2584 cm1. Such low-frequency
shifts of about 300 cm1 have never been observed before
either for ethane adsorbed by oxides or by any cationic form of
zeolite. It is concluded that such unusual properties of ad-
sorbed C2H6 molecules resulted from formation of a rather
strong s-type donor–acceptor adsorption complexes with the
exchanged univalent copper cations. However, such a strong
perturbation does not result in subsequent dissociation of
ethane at higher temperatures.
DFT modeling of C2H6 adsorption by the isolated Cu1
cations stabilized at the a-site of the ZSM-5 zeolite has shown
that the most preferential geometry of adsorption complexes
corresponds to interaction with copper of two protons from the

same methyl group. The bonding in such [Cu1(Z2-C2H6)]Z
complexes could be rationalized by a synergetic combination of
ligand-to-metal electron donation from C–H s-orbitals to the
partially-occupied Cu1 s-orbital combined with metal-to-li-
gand back-donation from the copper dp-orbitals to C–H s*
orbitals. In contrast to the previously reported very unstable
transition metal complexes of light alkanes or to the complexes
of the alkanes with the naked transition metal cations, the
obtained s-type ethane-Cu1 adsorption complexes display a
rather high stability that allows their DRIFT investigation.
