[1] "ZnMFI catalyzes dehydrogenation and aromatization of light paraffins, etc."

[2] "Unlike ion exchange or incipient wetness impregnation, the reaction of hydrogen forms of MFI with zinc vapour at 773 K results in the practically complete substitution of protons by zinc ions."

[3] "Besides the removal of acidic protons, the chemical reaction with zinc vapour also results in the appearance of two new sites of molecular hydrogen adsorption with HH stretching frequencies of 4010 and 3938 cm1."

[4] "As discussed in ref. 9, such localization most likely corresponds to the following structure with alternating positive and negative electric charges:
2AlO2H + Zn0 → AlO2Zn2+ + AlO2− + H2"

[5] "The unusually large red shifts of HH stretching vibrations created by such acidbase pairs with well separated zinc Lewis sites and negatively charged basic oxygen should be explained by very strong perturbation of adsorbed hydrogen by the zinc cations with only partially compensated positive electric charges."

The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations. In the case of zinc-exchanged MFI zeolites:

1. Composition: The Si/Al ratio of the zeolite framework affects the distribution and nature of zinc sites. Higher Si/Al ratios lead to more isolated zinc cations with partially compensated positive charges.

2. Structure: Zinc cations can be located at isolated aluminum sites or paired aluminum sites in the zeolite framework. This creates different types of active sites for catalysis.

3. Reaction conditions: The method of zinc introduction (ion exchange, impregnation, or reaction with zinc vapor) greatly affects the nature and distribution of zinc sites. Reaction with zinc vapor at high temperatures (773 K) results in complete substitution of protons by zinc ions.

These factors contribute to the catalytic activity of ZnMFI in dehydrogenation and aromatization of light paraffins. The unique charge-alternating structure with well-separated zinc Lewis sites and basic oxygen creates highly active sites for hydrogen activation and alkane transformation.

The industrial significance of these catalysts stems from their ability to perform important hydrocarbon transformations under relatively mild conditions. The strong perturbation of adsorbed molecules by zinc cations with partially compensated positive charges enables efficient activation of C-H bonds, which is crucial for dehydrogenation and aromatization processes.

金属基催化剂的组成、结构和反应条件显著影响烷烃转化的机理和效率。以锌交换的MFI沸石为例：

1. 组成：沸石骨架的硅铝比影响锌位点的分布和性质。较高的硅铝比导致更多的孤立锌阳离子，其正电荷只被部分补偿。

2. 结构：锌阳离子可以位于沸石骨架中的孤立铝位点或成对铝位点上。这创造了不同类型的催化活性位点。

3. 反应条件：锌引入的方法（离子交换、浸渍或与锌蒸气反应）极大地影响锌位点的性质和分布。在高温（773 K）下与锌蒸气反应会导致质子被锌离子完全取代。

这些因素共同促进了ZnMFI在轻质烷烃脱氢和芳构化方面的催化活性。具有分离良好的锌Lewis酸位点和碱性氧的独特交替电荷结构，为氢活化和烷烃转化创造了高活性位点。

这些催化剂的工业意义在于它们能够在相对温和的条件下进行重要的碳氢化合物转化。锌阳离子部分补偿的正电荷对吸附分子的强烈扰动，使C-H键能够高效活化，这对脱氢和芳构化过程至关重要。
