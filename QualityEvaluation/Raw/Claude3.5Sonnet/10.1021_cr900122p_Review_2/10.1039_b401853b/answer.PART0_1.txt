[1] "CoMFI catalyzes the ammo-oxidation of ethane, whereas ZnMFI catalyzes dehydrogenation and aromatization of light paraffins, etc."

[2] "Our recent results also demonstrated that MFI modified with bivalent Zn or Co cations possess unusual adsorption properties. For instance, low-frequency shifts of HH stretching vibrations of molecular hydrogen adsorbed by these ions at 77 K exceed 200 cm1."

[3] "Zinc or other bivalent ions with only partially compensated positive charges exhibit an unusually high chemical activity. This explains the specific catalytic and adsorption properties of high-silica zeolites modified with the bivalent transition metal cations."

[4] "Comparison of DRIFT spectra of OH groups in MFI with framework Si/Al ratios equal to 25 or 40 with the spectra of the same zeolites after reaction with zinc vapour at 773 K indicated quantitative substitution of acidic hydroxyls by Zn2 ions."

The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations:

1. Composition: The type of metal ion (e.g., Zn, Co) in metal-exchanged zeolites affects the catalytic properties. For example, ZnMFI catalyzes dehydrogenation and aromatization of light paraffins, while CoMFI catalyzes ammo-oxidation of ethane.

2. Structure: High-silica zeolites (like MFI) modified with bivalent transition metal cations exhibit unusual adsorption properties and high chemical activity. This is due to the formation of sites with partially compensated positive charges when bivalent cations are introduced into the zeolite framework.

3. Reaction conditions: The method of metal introduction affects catalyst properties. For instance, reaction with zinc vapor at 773 K results in quantitative substitution of acidic hydroxyls by Zn2+ ions, which is not achieved by conventional ion exchange methods.

4. Si/Al ratio: The framework Si/Al ratio influences the distribution and properties of metal sites. Higher Si/Al ratios lead to more isolated metal sites with stronger perturbation of adsorbed molecules.

These factors contribute to the industrial significance of metal-exchanged zeolites by enabling specific catalytic transformations, such as dehydrogenation and aromatization of light paraffins. The unique properties of these catalysts, including their ability to strongly perturb and activate adsorbed molecules, make them valuable for various industrial processes involving alkane transformations.

金属基催化剂的组成、结构和反应条件显著影响烷烃转化的机理和效率：

1. 组成：金属离子交换的沸石中金属离子的类型（如Zn、Co）影响催化性能。例如，ZnMFI催化轻质烷烃的脱氢和芳构化，而CoMFI催化乙烷的氨氧化。

2. 结构：用二价过渡金属阳离子改性的高硅沸石（如MFI）表现出不寻常的吸附性质和高化学活性。这是由于二价阳离子引入沸石骨架后形成了带部分补偿正电荷的位点。

3. 反应条件：金属引入方法影响催化剂性能。例如，在773 K下与锌蒸气反应可实现酸性羟基被Zn2+离子的定量取代，这是常规离子交换方法无法实现的。

4. Si/Al比：骨架Si/Al比影响金属位点的分布和性质。更高的Si/Al比导致更多孤立的金属位点，对吸附分子的扰动更强。

这些因素通过实现特定的催化转化（如轻质烷烃的脱氢和芳构化）来促进金属交换沸石的工业重要性。这些催化剂的独特性质，包括它们强烈扰动和活化吸附分子的能力，使它们在涉及烷烃转化的各种工业过程中具有重要价值。
