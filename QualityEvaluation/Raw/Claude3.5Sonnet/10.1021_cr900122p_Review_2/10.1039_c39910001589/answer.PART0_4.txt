[1] "We report here that a zirconium hydride complex, grafted onto the surface of silica, acquires such high electrophilic properties, that the reaction of o-bond metathesis between the Zr hydride and the C-H bonds of cyclooctane and methane becomes feasible."

[2] "The silica surface enhances the electrophilicity of the zirconium centre, allowing the reaction of C-H activation of alkanes."

[3] "This increase in the electrophilic character of the metal is probably related to the stabilization of an 8e-Zr by the surface siloxy ligands, while molecular analogues are usually stabilized by two cyclopentadienyl ligands and thus have a 16e-configuration."

The literature focuses on a silica-supported zirconium hydride catalyst rather than vanadium oxides or metal-exchanged zeolites. However, it provides insights into how support materials can influence catalyst properties and reactivity:

1. Composition: The catalyst consists of a zirconium hydride complex grafted onto silica.

2. Structure: The silica support enhances the electrophilicity of the zirconium center, likely due to stabilization by surface siloxy ligands. This results in an 8-electron configuration for Zr, compared to 16-electron configurations in molecular analogues.

3. Reaction conditions: The supported catalyst can activate C-H bonds in cyclooctane at room temperature and in methane at 423 K and 5.3 x 10^4 Pa.

4. Mechanism: The high electrophilicity enables σ-bond metathesis between the Zr-H and C-H bonds of alkanes.

5. Efficiency: The catalyst can activate typically unreactive C-H bonds in alkanes under relatively mild conditions.

While this specific catalyst may not have direct industrial applications, it demonstrates how tailoring support materials can dramatically alter catalytic properties, potentially leading to more efficient alkane transformation processes.

这篇文献主要关注的是硅胶负载的锆氢化物催化剂，而不是钒氧化物或金属交换沸石。然而，它提供了关于载体材料如何影响催化剂性质和反应活性的见解：

1. 组成：催化剂由接枝在硅胶上的锆氢化物络合物组成。

2. 结构：硅胶载体增强了锆中心的亲电性，这可能是由于表面硅氧基配体的稳定作用。这导致锆形成8电子构型，而分子类似物通常是16电子构型。

3. 反应条件：该负载催化剂可以在室温下活化环辛烷的C-H键，在423 K和5.3 x 10^4 Pa的条件下活化甲烷的C-H键。

4. 机理：高亲电性使锆-氢键与烷烃的C-H键之间能够进行σ键互变。

5. 效率：该催化剂能在相对温和的条件下活化通常不活泼的烷烃C-H键。

虽然这种特定的催化剂可能没有直接的工业应用，但它展示了如何通过调整载体材料来显著改变催化性能，这可能导致更高效的烷烃转化过程。
