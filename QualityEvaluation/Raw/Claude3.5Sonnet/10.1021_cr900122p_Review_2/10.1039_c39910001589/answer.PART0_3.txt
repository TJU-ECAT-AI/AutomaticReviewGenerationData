[1] "We report here that a zirconium hydride complex, grafted onto the surface of silica, acquires such high electrophilic properties, that the reaction of o-bond metathesis between the Zr hydride and the C-H bonds of cyclooctane and methane becomes feasible."

[2] "The silica surface enhances the electrophilicity of the zirconium centre, allowing the reaction of C-H activation of alkanes."

[3] "This increase in the electrophilic character of the metal is probably related to the stabilization of an 8e-Zr by the surface siloxy ligands, while molecular analogues are usually stabilized by two cyclopentadienyl ligands and thus have a 16e-configuration."

The literature primarily focuses on a silica-supported zirconium hydride complex rather than vanadium oxides or metal-exchanged zeolites. However, it does provide insights into how support materials can influence metal-based catalysts for alkane transformations:

1. Composition: The catalyst consists of a zirconium hydride complex grafted onto a silica surface.

2. Structure: The silica support enhances the electrophilicity of the zirconium center by stabilizing an 8-electron configuration, as opposed to the 16-electron configuration in molecular analogues.

3. Reaction conditions: The supported catalyst can activate C-H bonds in cyclooctane at room temperature and in methane at 423 K and 5.3 x 10^4 Pa.

4. Mechanism: The enhanced electrophilicity of the metal center enables σ-bond metathesis between the Zr-H and C-H bonds of alkanes.

5. Efficiency: The supported catalyst can activate even unreactive alkanes like methane, suggesting high efficiency.

6. Industrial significance: While not explicitly discussed, the ability to activate methane under relatively mild conditions could have important implications for natural gas utilization.

This example demonstrates how support materials can dramatically alter the properties and reactivity of metal catalysts, potentially leading to more efficient alkane transformation processes.

该文献主要关注的是硅胶负载的锆氢化物复合物，而不是钒氧化物或金属交换沸石。然而，它确实提供了关于载体材料如何影响金属基催化剂用于烷烃转化的见解：

1. 组成：催化剂由接枝在硅胶表面的锆氢化物复合物组成。

2. 结构：硅胶载体通过稳定8电子构型增强了锆中心的亲电性，而分子类似物通常是16电子构型。

3. 反应条件：该负载催化剂可以在室温下活化环辛烷的C-H键，在423 K和5.3 x 10^4 Pa下活化甲烷的C-H键。

4. 机理：金属中心增强的亲电性使得锆-氢键与烷烃的C-H键之间能够进行σ键复分解反应。

5. 效率：该负载催化剂能够活化甚至像甲烷这样不活泼的烷烃，表明其具有高效率。

6. 工业意义：虽然没有明确讨论，但在相对温和的条件下活化甲烷的能力可能对天然气利用有重要影响。

这个例子展示了载体材料如何能显著改变金属催化剂的性质和反应活性，potentially导致更高效的烷烃转化过程。
