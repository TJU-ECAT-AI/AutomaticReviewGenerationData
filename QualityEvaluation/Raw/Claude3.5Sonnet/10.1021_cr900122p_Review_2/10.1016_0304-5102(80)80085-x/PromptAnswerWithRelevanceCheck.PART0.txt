[1] "Silica-supported zirconium hydrides exhibit high activity towards olefin isomerization under mild conditions."

[2] "We find that these supported organozirconium compounds inefficiently catalyze the isomerization of 1-butene to cis- and trans-2-butene at room temperature. However, high rates of isomerization are realized if the supported zirconium alkyl compounds are first hydrogenated."

[3] "Typical olefin isomerization experiments were performed by adding a twentyfold molar excess of olefin to a slurry of the catalyst in toluene solvent."

[4] "Rates of isomerization are sterically controlled, decreasing in the order 1-butene > 1-hexene > allylbenzene > methylenecyclohexane"

[5] "When a twentyfold molar excess of 1-butene was added to a toluene slurry of the catalyst, hydrogenation (H2, 1 atm, 25°C) to butane was complete within 30 h."

The literature does not directly address vanadium oxides or metal-exchanged zeolites for alkane transformations. However, it does discuss silica-supported zirconium hydrides as catalysts for olefin isomerization and hydrogenation, which provides some insights into how metal-based catalysts influence alkane transformations:

Composition: The catalysts described are silica-supported zirconium hydrides, formed by hydrogenating supported organozirconium compounds.

Structure: The catalysts are heterogeneous, with zirconium species bound to a silica support.

Reaction conditions: Mild conditions are used for isomerization (room temperature, atmospheric pressure). Hydrogenation is performed at 1 atm H2 and 25°C.

Mechanisms: Olefin isomerization likely involves intermediary alkylzirconium species. The relative rates of isomerization correlate with the relative stabilities of these intermediates.

Efficiency: The catalysts show high activity for olefin isomerization, with rates competitive or faster than other known catalysts. Hydrogenation is also observed but at lower rates than isomerization.

Factors contributing to significance: The catalysts operate under mild conditions, require no cocatalyst, and show long lifetimes for isomerization reactions when air and water are excluded. They can isomerize various olefins and perform hydrogenation, demonstrating versatility.

While this study focuses on olefin transformations rather than alkanes, it illustrates how supported metal catalysts can be tailored for specific reactions and how their composition, structure, and reaction conditions influence their catalytic properties.

这篇文献并没有直接讨论钒氧化物或金属交换沸石在烷烃转化中的应用。然而，它确实讨论了二氧化硅负载的锆氢化物作为烯烃异构化和加氢的催化剂，这为金属基催化剂如何影响烷烃转化提供了一些见解：

成分：所描述的催化剂是二氧化硅负载的锆氢化物，通过氢化负载的有机锆化合物形成。

结构：催化剂是异相的，锆物种与二氧化硅载体结合。

反应条件：异构化使用温和条件（室温，大气压）。加氢在1个大气压H2和25°C下进行。

机理：烯烃异构化可能涉及中间烷基锆物种。异构化的相对速率与这些中间体的相对稳定性相关。

效率：催化剂对烯烃异构化表现出高活性，速率与其他已知催化剂相比具有竞争力或更快。也观察到加氢反应，但速率低于异构化。

对重要性有贡献的因素：催化剂在温和条件下运行，不需要助催化剂，并且在排除空气和水的情况下，异构化反应具有长寿命。它们可以异构化各种烯烃并进行加氢，表现出多功能性。

虽然这项研究侧重于烯烃转化而非烷烃，但它说明了如何针对特定反应调整负载金属催化剂，以及它们的成分、结构和反应条件如何影响其催化性能。

The literature does not directly address the specific question about vanadium oxides and metal-exchanged zeolites for alkane transformations. However, it does provide information on silica-supported zirconium hydride catalysts for olefin isomerization and hydrogenation, which offers some insights into how composition, structure, and reaction conditions influence catalytic mechanisms and efficiency:

1. Composition: The catalysts are composed of zirconium hydrides supported on silica. The active species is formed by hydrogenolysis of metal oxide-bound organozirconium complexes.

2. Structure: The catalysts are heterogeneous, with zirconium species attached to a silica support. This structure likely contributes to their stability and catalytic activity.

3. Reaction conditions: Mild conditions are sufficient for olefin isomerization. Hydrogenation requires slightly more forceful conditions (H2, 1 atm, 25°C). The catalysts are sensitive to air and water, requiring their rigorous exclusion.

4. Mechanism: The catalysts operate through a proposed mechanism involving supported zirconium alkyl hydride species and the formation of intermediary alkylzirconium compounds.

5. Efficiency: The catalysts show high activity for olefin isomerization, with rates competitive with or faster than other known catalysts. They are also effective for hydrogenation, though at slower rates than isomerization.

While this information doesn't directly address the industrial significance of these catalysts, their high activity under mild conditions and long-lived nature (when properly protected) suggest potential for industrial applications in olefin isomerization and hydrogenation processes.

虽然这篇文献没有直接涉及钒氧化物和金属交换沸石在烷烃转化中的应用，但它提供了有关硅胶负载的锆氢化物催化剂在烯烃异构化和氢化反应中的信息，这为我们了解组成、结构和反应条件如何影响催化机理和效率提供了一些见解：

1. 组成：催化剂由硅胶负载的锆氢化物组成。活性物种是通过金属氧化物结合的有机锆络合物的氢解反应形成的。

2. 结构：催化剂是异相的，锆物种附着在硅胶载体上。这种结构可能有助于其稳定性和催化活性。

3. 反应条件：温和条件足以进行烯烃异构化。氢化反应需要稍微强一些的条件（H2，1 atm，25°C）。催化剂对空气和水很敏感，需要严格排除这些因素。

4. 机理：催化剂通过一种涉及负载锆烷基氢化物物种和中间烷基锆化合物形成的机理进行操作。

5. 效率：催化剂对烯烃异构化表现出高活性，其速率与其他已知催化剂相当或更快。它们对氢化反应也很有效，尽管速率比异构化慢。

虽然这些信息并未直接涉及这些催化剂的工业重要性，但它们在温和条件下的高活性和长寿命特性（在适当保护下）表明它们在烯烃异构化和氢化过程中具有潜在的工业应用价值。

1. Composition and structure: The catalysts consist of zirconium hydrides supported on silica. They are prepared by depositing organozirconium compounds on silica and then hydrogenating them.

2. Reaction conditions: The catalysts are active under mild conditions, including room temperature for some reactions. Air and water must be rigorously excluded to maintain catalyst longevity.

3. Mechanisms: The catalysts likely operate through intermediary alkylzirconium species. Olefin isomerization involves insertion of the olefin into a metal-hydride bond, followed by β-hydride elimination.

4. Efficiency: These catalysts exhibit high activity for olefin isomerization, with rates competitive with or faster than other known catalysts. They can also catalyze hydrogenation, though at lower rates than isomerization.

5. Industrial significance: While not explicitly stated, the high activity and mild reaction conditions suggest potential industrial applications, particularly for olefin isomerization processes.

The study focuses on laboratory-scale experiments and does not discuss industrial applications directly. More research would be needed to fully assess the industrial potential of these catalysts.
