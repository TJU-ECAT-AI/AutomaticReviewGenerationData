[1] "Silica-supported zirconium hydrides exhibit high activity towards olefin isomerization under mild conditions."

[2] "Recently it has been demonstrated that metal oxide-bound organozirconium complexes (1) [1, 2] undergo hydrogenolysis [3] to yield attached zirconium hydrides (2) which are highly active catalysts for ethylene polymerization."

[3] "We find that these supported organozirconium compounds inefficiently catalyze the isomerization of 1-butene to cis- and trans-2-butene at room temperature. However, high rates of isomerization are realized if the supported zirconium alkyl compounds are first hydrogenated."

[4] "The isomerization catalyst system derived from 2 is long lived either upon standing or under isomerization reaction conditions provided that air and water are rigorously excluded."

The literature does not directly address the question about vanadium oxides and metal-exchanged zeolites for alkane transformations. However, it does provide some relevant information about silica-supported zirconium catalysts for olefin isomerization and hydrogenation:

1. Composition and structure: The catalysts consist of zirconium hydrides supported on silica. They are prepared by depositing organozirconium compounds on silica and then hydrogenating them.

2. Reaction conditions: The catalysts are active under mild conditions, including room temperature for some reactions. Air and water must be rigorously excluded to maintain catalyst longevity.

3. Mechanisms: The catalysts likely operate through intermediary alkylzirconium species. Olefin isomerization involves insertion of the olefin into a metal-hydride bond, followed by β-hydride elimination.

4. Efficiency: These catalysts exhibit high activity for olefin isomerization, with rates competitive with or faster than other known catalysts. They can also catalyze hydrogenation, though at lower rates than isomerization.

5. Industrial significance: While not explicitly stated, the high activity and mild reaction conditions suggest potential industrial applications, particularly for olefin isomerization processes.

The study focuses on laboratory-scale experiments and does not discuss industrial applications directly. More research would be needed to fully assess the industrial potential of these catalysts.

该文献没有直接涉及钒氧化物和金属交换沸石在烷烃转化中的应用。但是，它提供了一些关于硅胶负载的锆催化剂用于烯烃异构化和加氢的相关信息：

1. 组成和结构：催化剂由负载在硅胶上的锆氢化物组成。它们是通过将有机锆化合物沉积在硅胶上，然后进行加氢制备而成。

2. 反应条件：这些催化剂在温和条件下具有活性，包括某些反应在室温下进行。必须严格排除空气和水以维持催化剂的长期活性。

3. 机理：催化剂可能通过中间的烷基锆物种起作用。烯烃异构化涉及烯烃插入金属-氢键，随后发生β-氢消除。

4. 效率：这些催化剂对烯烃异构化表现出高活性，反应速率与其他已知催化剂相当或更快。它们也可以催化加氢反应，但速率低于异构化反应。

5. 工业意义：虽然没有明确说明，但高活性和温和的反应条件表明这些催化剂具有潜在的工业应用前景，特别是在烯烃异构化过程中。

该研究主要集中在实验室规模的实验，没有直接讨论工业应用。需要进行更多研究才能全面评估这些催化剂的工业潜力。
