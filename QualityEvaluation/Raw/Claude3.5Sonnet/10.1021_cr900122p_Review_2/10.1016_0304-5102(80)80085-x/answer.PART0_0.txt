[1] "Silica-supported zirconium hydrides exhibit high activity towards olefin isomerization under mild conditions."

[2] "We find that these supported organozirconium compounds inefficiently catalyze the isomerization of 1-butene to cis- and trans-2-butene at room temperature. However, high rates of isomerization are realized if the supported zirconium alkyl compounds are first hydrogenated."

[3] "Typical olefin isomerization experiments were performed by adding a twentyfold molar excess of olefin to a slurry of the catalyst in toluene solvent."

[4] "Rates of isomerization are sterically controlled, decreasing in the order 1-butene > 1-hexene > allylbenzene > methylenecyclohexane"

[5] "When a twentyfold molar excess of 1-butene was added to a toluene slurry of the catalyst, hydrogenation (H2, 1 atm, 25°C) to butane was complete within 30 h."

The literature does not directly address vanadium oxides or metal-exchanged zeolites for alkane transformations. However, it does discuss silica-supported zirconium hydrides as catalysts for olefin isomerization and hydrogenation, which provides some insights into how metal-based catalysts influence alkane transformations:

Composition: The catalysts described are silica-supported zirconium hydrides, formed by hydrogenating supported organozirconium compounds.

Structure: The catalysts are heterogeneous, with zirconium species bound to a silica support.

Reaction conditions: Mild conditions are used for isomerization (room temperature, atmospheric pressure). Hydrogenation is performed at 1 atm H2 and 25°C.

Mechanisms: Olefin isomerization likely involves intermediary alkylzirconium species. The relative rates of isomerization correlate with the relative stabilities of these intermediates.

Efficiency: The catalysts show high activity for olefin isomerization, with rates competitive or faster than other known catalysts. Hydrogenation is also observed but at lower rates than isomerization.

Factors contributing to significance: The catalysts operate under mild conditions, require no cocatalyst, and show long lifetimes for isomerization reactions when air and water are excluded. They can isomerize various olefins and perform hydrogenation, demonstrating versatility.

While this study focuses on olefin transformations rather than alkanes, it illustrates how supported metal catalysts can be tailored for specific reactions and how their composition, structure, and reaction conditions influence their catalytic properties.

这篇文献并没有直接讨论钒氧化物或金属交换沸石在烷烃转化中的应用。然而，它确实讨论了二氧化硅负载的锆氢化物作为烯烃异构化和加氢的催化剂，这为金属基催化剂如何影响烷烃转化提供了一些见解：

成分：所描述的催化剂是二氧化硅负载的锆氢化物，通过氢化负载的有机锆化合物形成。

结构：催化剂是异相的，锆物种与二氧化硅载体结合。

反应条件：异构化使用温和条件（室温，大气压）。加氢在1个大气压H2和25°C下进行。

机理：烯烃异构化可能涉及中间烷基锆物种。异构化的相对速率与这些中间体的相对稳定性相关。

效率：催化剂对烯烃异构化表现出高活性，速率与其他已知催化剂相比具有竞争力或更快。也观察到加氢反应，但速率低于异构化。

对重要性有贡献的因素：催化剂在温和条件下运行，不需要助催化剂，并且在排除空气和水的情况下，异构化反应具有长寿命。它们可以异构化各种烯烃并进行加氢，表现出多功能性。

虽然这项研究侧重于烯烃转化而非烷烃，但它说明了如何针对特定反应调整负载金属催化剂，以及它们的成分、结构和反应条件如何影响其催化性能。
