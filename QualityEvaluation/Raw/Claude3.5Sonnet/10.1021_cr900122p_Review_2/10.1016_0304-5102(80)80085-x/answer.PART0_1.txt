[1] "Silica-supported zirconium hydrides exhibit high activity towards olefin isomerization under mild conditions."

[2] "Recently it has been demonstrated that metal oxide-bound organozirconium complexes (1) [1, 2] undergo hydrogenolysis [3] to yield attached zirconium hydrides (2) which are highly active catalysts for ethylene polymerization."

[3] "We find that these supported organozirconium compounds inefficiently catalyze the isomerization of 1-butene to cis- and trans-2-butene at room temperature. However, high rates of isomerization are realized if the supported zirconium alkyl compounds are first hydrogenated."

[4] "The isomerization catalyst system derived from 2 is long lived either upon standing or under isomerization reaction conditions provided that air and water are rigorously excluded."

[5] "When a twentyfold molar excess of 1-butene was added to a toluene slurry of the catalyst, hydrogenation (H2, 1 atm, 25°C) to butane was complete within 30 h."

The literature does not directly address the specific question about vanadium oxides and metal-exchanged zeolites for alkane transformations. However, it does provide information on silica-supported zirconium hydride catalysts for olefin isomerization and hydrogenation, which offers some insights into how composition, structure, and reaction conditions influence catalytic mechanisms and efficiency:

1. Composition: The catalysts are composed of zirconium hydrides supported on silica. The active species is formed by hydrogenolysis of metal oxide-bound organozirconium complexes.

2. Structure: The catalysts are heterogeneous, with zirconium species attached to a silica support. This structure likely contributes to their stability and catalytic activity.

3. Reaction conditions: Mild conditions are sufficient for olefin isomerization. Hydrogenation requires slightly more forceful conditions (H2, 1 atm, 25°C). The catalysts are sensitive to air and water, requiring their rigorous exclusion.

4. Mechanism: The catalysts operate through a proposed mechanism involving supported zirconium alkyl hydride species and the formation of intermediary alkylzirconium compounds.

5. Efficiency: The catalysts show high activity for olefin isomerization, with rates competitive with or faster than other known catalysts. They are also effective for hydrogenation, though at slower rates than isomerization.

While this information doesn't directly address the industrial significance of these catalysts, their high activity under mild conditions and long-lived nature (when properly protected) suggest potential for industrial applications in olefin isomerization and hydrogenation processes.

虽然这篇文献没有直接涉及钒氧化物和金属交换沸石在烷烃转化中的应用，但它提供了有关硅胶负载的锆氢化物催化剂在烯烃异构化和氢化反应中的信息，这为我们了解组成、结构和反应条件如何影响催化机理和效率提供了一些见解：

1. 组成：催化剂由硅胶负载的锆氢化物组成。活性物种是通过金属氧化物结合的有机锆络合物的氢解反应形成的。

2. 结构：催化剂是异相的，锆物种附着在硅胶载体上。这种结构可能有助于其稳定性和催化活性。

3. 反应条件：温和条件足以进行烯烃异构化。氢化反应需要稍微强一些的条件（H2，1 atm，25°C）。催化剂对空气和水很敏感，需要严格排除这些因素。

4. 机理：催化剂通过一种涉及负载锆烷基氢化物物种和中间烷基锆化合物形成的机理进行操作。

5. 效率：催化剂对烯烃异构化表现出高活性，其速率与其他已知催化剂相当或更快。它们对氢化反应也很有效，尽管速率比异构化慢。

虽然这些信息并未直接涉及这些催化剂的工业重要性，但它们在温和条件下的高活性和长寿命特性（在适当保护下）表明它们在烯烃异构化和氢化过程中具有潜在的工业应用价值。
