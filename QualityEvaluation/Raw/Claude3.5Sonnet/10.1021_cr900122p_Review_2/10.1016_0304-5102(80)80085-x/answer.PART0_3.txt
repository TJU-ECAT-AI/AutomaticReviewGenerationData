[1] "Silica-supported zirconium hydrides exhibit high activity towards olefin isomerization under mild conditions."

[2] "We find that these supported organozirconium compounds inefficiently catalyze the isomerization of 1-butene to cis- and trans-2-butene at room temperature. However, high rates of isomerization are realized if the supported zirconium alkyl compounds are first hydrogenated."

[3] "The isomerization catalyst system derived from 2 is long lived either upon standing or under isomerization reaction conditions provided that air and water are rigorously excluded."

[4] "Rates of isomerization are sterically controlled, decreasing in the order 1-butene > 1-hexene > allylbenzene > methylenecyclohexane"

[5] "When a twentyfold molar excess of 1-butene was added to a toluene slurry of the catalyst, hydrogenation (H2, 1 atm, 25 C) to butane was complete within 30 h."

The literature discusses silica-supported zirconium-based catalysts rather than supported vanadium oxides or metal-exchanged zeolites. However, it provides some insights into how the composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts influence alkane transformations:

1. Composition: The catalysts are silica-supported zirconium hydrides, formed by hydrogenating supported organozirconium compounds.

2. Structure: The catalysts are heterogeneous, with zirconium species bound to a silica support.

3. Reaction conditions: 
   - Mild conditions are sufficient for olefin isomerization.
   - Hydrogenation of the initial organozirconium compounds is necessary for high isomerization activity.
   - Rigorous exclusion of air and water is required for catalyst longevity.
   - Temperature affects reaction rates, with some reactions requiring higher temperatures (e.g., 55°C for allylbenzene and methylenecyclohexane isomerization).

4. Mechanisms: The catalysts are active for both olefin isomerization and hydrogenation, with isomerization being faster under the conditions studied. The mechanism likely involves intermediary alkylzirconium species.

5. Efficiency: 
   - Isomerization rates are sterically controlled, with smaller olefins reacting faster.
   - The catalysts show high activity and long lifetimes under proper conditions.
   - Hydrogenation is slower than isomerization but can be achieved at room temperature and atmospheric pressure.

While the industrial significance of these specific catalysts is not directly addressed, their ability to perform isomerization and hydrogenation under mild conditions suggests potential industrial applications in olefin processing.

该文献讨论的是基于二氧化硅负载的锆基催化剂，而不是负载的钒氧化物或金属交换的沸石。然而，它提供了一些关于金属基催化剂的组成、结构和反应条件如何影响烷烃转化的见解：

1. 组成：催化剂是二氧化硅负载的锆氢化物，由负载的有机锆化合物氢化而成。

2. 结构：催化剂是异相的，锆物种与二氧化硅载体结合。

3. 反应条件：
   - 温和条件足以进行烯烃异构化。
   - 初始有机锆化合物的氢化对于高异构化活性是必要的。
   - 严格排除空气和水对催化剂寿命至关重要。
   - 温度影响反应速率，某些反应需要更高的温度（例如，苯乙烯和甲基环己烷的异构化需要55°C）。

4. 机理：催化剂对烯烃异构化和氢化都有活性，在所研究的条件下异构化速度更快。机理可能涉及中间烷基锆物种。

5. 效率：
   - 异构化速率受立体效应控制，较小的烯烃反应更快。
   - 在适当条件下，催化剂表现出高活性和长寿命。
   - 氢化比异构化慢，但可以在室温和大气压下进行。

虽然没有直接讨论这些特定催化剂的工业重要性，但它们在温和条件下进行异构化和氢化的能力表明它们在烯烃加工方面可能具有潜在的工业应用。
