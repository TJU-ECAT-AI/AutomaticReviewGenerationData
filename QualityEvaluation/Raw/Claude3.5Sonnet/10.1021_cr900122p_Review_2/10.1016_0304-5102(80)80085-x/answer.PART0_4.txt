[1] "Silica-supported zirconium hydrides exhibit high activity towards olefin isomerization under mild conditions."

[2] "Recently it has been demonstrated that metal oxide-bound organozirconium complexes (1) [1, 2] undergo hydrogenolysis [3] to yield attached zirconium hydrides (2) which are highly active catalysts for ethylene polymerization."

[3] "We find that these supported organozirconium compounds inefficiently catalyze the isomerization of 1-butene to cis- and trans-2-butene at room temperature. However, high rates of isomerization are realized if the supported zirconium alkyl compounds are first hydrogenated."

[4] "The isomerization catalyst system derived from 2 is long lived either upon standing or under isomerization reaction conditions provided that air and water are rigorously excluded."

[5] "Rates of isomerization are sterically controlled, decreasing in the order 1-butene > 1-hexene > allylbenzene > methylenecyclohexane"

The literature does not directly address vanadium oxides or metal-exchanged zeolites for alkane transformations. However, it does discuss silica-supported zirconium catalysts for olefin isomerization and hydrogenation, which provides some insights into how composition, structure, and reaction conditions influence catalytic activity:

1. Composition: The catalysts are composed of zirconium hydrides supported on silica. The active species is formed by hydrogenolysis of organozirconium complexes bound to the metal oxide support.

2. Structure: The catalysts are heterogeneous, with zirconium species attached to a silica support. This structure likely contributes to their stability and activity.

3. Reaction conditions: Mild conditions are sufficient for olefin isomerization. Hydrogenation of the supported zirconium alkyl compounds is necessary to achieve high isomerization rates. The catalysts are sensitive to air and water, requiring their rigorous exclusion.

4. Mechanism: The proposed mechanism involves the intermediacy of alkylzirconium species, with relative rates correlating to the stability of these intermediates.

5. Efficiency: The catalysts show high activity for olefin isomerization, with rates competitive or faster than other known catalysts. Efficiency is influenced by steric factors, with smaller olefins isomerizing more rapidly.

While this system is different from vanadium oxides or zeolites, it demonstrates how supported metal catalysts can be effective for hydrocarbon transformations. The influence of composition, structure, and reaction conditions on catalyst performance is likely applicable to other metal-based systems as well.

这篇文献并未直接讨论钒氧化物或金属交换沸石在烷烃转化中的应用。然而，它确实讨论了硅胶负载的锆催化剂在烯烃异构化和加氢反应中的应用，这为我们理解催化剂的组成、结构和反应条件如何影响催化活性提供了一些见解：

1. 组成：催化剂由硅胶负载的锆氢化物组成。活性物种是通过金属氧化物支持体上结合的有机锆络合物的氢解反应形成的。

2. 结构：这些催化剂是异相的，锆物种附着在硅胶支持体上。这种结构可能有助于其稳定性和活性。

3. 反应条件：温和的条件就足以进行烯烃异构化。对负载的锆烷基化合物进行加氢处理是实现高异构化速率的必要条件。这些催化剂对空气和水分敏感，需要严格排除它们。

4. 机理：提出的机理涉及烷基锆中间体的形成，相对反应速率与这些中间体的稳定性相关。

5. 效率：这些催化剂对烯烃异构化表现出高活性，速率与其他已知催化剂相当或更快。效率受立体因素影响，较小的烯烃异构化更快。

虽然这个体系与钒氧化物或沸石不同，但它展示了负载金属催化剂如何能够有效地进行烃类转化。组成、结构和反应条件对催化剂性能的影响可能也适用于其他基于金属的体系。
