[1] "All catalysts used industrially for the production of maleic anhydride from butane are PVO-based systems."

[2] "The vanadyl pyrophosphate catalyst, due to its particular crystalline structure, shows a singular ability to control its oxidizing power."

[3] "The best selectivity is achieved when desorption of less selective intermediates along the reaction coordinate is avoided because the olefin reactions are less selective on a highly active butane (VO)2P2O7 catalyst."

[4] "The availability of oxygen to the surface is critical in avoiding desorption of less selective olefins. Thus it would appear that major selectivity gains could be achieved if more oxygen could be channeled to the active site."

[5] "A central role in the modification of surface reactivity is adsorption of organic molecules and oxygen species. The mobility of these species under steady-state conditions of reaction is another characteristic of the vanadyl pyrophosphate catalyst in n-butane oxidation"

The composition, structure and reaction conditions of vanadium phosphorus oxide (PVO) catalysts significantly influence the mechanism and efficiency of n-butane oxidation to maleic anhydride:

1. PVO catalysts, particularly vanadyl pyrophosphate ((VO)2P2O7), are uniquely selective for this reaction due to their crystalline structure.

2. The catalyst's ability to control its oxidizing power is crucial for selectivity. This is achieved through structural site isolation of oxidizing sites.

3. Selectivity is maximized when desorption of less selective intermediates (e.g. olefins) is prevented. This requires careful control of surface oxidation state.

4. Oxygen availability at the surface is critical. Improving oxygen channeling to active sites could potentially increase selectivity.

5. Adsorption and mobility of organic molecules and oxygen species on the catalyst surface play a central role in modifying surface reactivity.

These factors contribute to the industrial significance of PVO catalysts for n-butane oxidation. The unique structural requirements for selective alkane activation and oxidation explain why other catalytic systems have not matched PVO's performance in this reaction.

钒磷氧化物（PVO）催化剂的组成、结构和反应条件显著影响正丁烷氧化制马来酸酐的机理和效率：

1. PVO催化剂，特别是钒焦磷酸盐（(VO)2P2O7），由于其晶体结构而对这种反应具有独特的选择性。

2. 催化剂控制其氧化能力的能力对选择性至关重要。这是通过氧化位点的结构隔离来实现的。

3. 当防止选择性较低的中间体（如烯烃）脱附时，选择性达到最大。这需要仔细控制表面氧化状态。

4. 表面氧的可用性至关重要。改善氧气向活性位点的输送可能会增加选择性。

5. 有机分子和氧物种在催化剂表面的吸附和移动性在改变表面反应性方面起着核心作用。

这些因素造就了PVO催化剂在正丁烷氧化中的工业重要性。选择性烷烃活化和氧化的独特结构要求解释了为什么其他催化体系在这种反应中无法匹配PVO的性能。
