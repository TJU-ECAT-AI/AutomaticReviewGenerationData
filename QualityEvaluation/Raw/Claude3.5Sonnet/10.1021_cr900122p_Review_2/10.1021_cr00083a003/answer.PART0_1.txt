[1] "The vanadyl pyrophosphate catalyst, due to its particular crystalline structure, shows a singular ability to control its oxidizing power."

[2] "The best selectivity is achieved when desorption of less selective intermediates along the reaction coordinate is avoided because the olefin reactions are less selective on a highly active butane (VO)2P2O7 catalyst."

[3] "A central role in the modification of surface reactivity is adsorption of organic molecules and oxygen species. The mobility of these species under steady-state conditions of reaction is another characteristic of the vanadyl pyrophosphate catalyst in n-butane oxidation"

[4] "Activation of the alkane hydrocarbon is a further important aspect of this reaction because of its mechanistic relevance in the study of other heterogeneous reactions for functionalization of alkanes"

[5] "A very specific surface structure is needed, and it would seem that the binding of intermediates until product is formed (single-site process) is essential to high selectivities."

The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations:

1. The crystalline structure of vanadyl pyrophosphate catalysts allows precise control over oxidizing power, which is crucial for selective oxidation.

2. Catalyst selectivity is optimized when intermediate desorption is prevented, as olefin reactions are less selective on highly active catalysts. 

3. Surface reactivity is modified by adsorption of organic molecules and oxygen species. The mobility of these species under steady-state conditions is an important characteristic of vanadyl pyrophosphate catalysts in n-butane oxidation.

4. Alkane activation is a key aspect, with implications for other heterogeneous reactions involving alkane functionalization.

5. A specific surface structure that binds intermediates until product formation (single-site process) is essential for high selectivities.

These factors contribute to the industrial significance of such catalysts by enabling precise control over reaction pathways, improving selectivity, and allowing for efficient alkane transformations. The unique properties of vanadyl pyrophosphate catalysts make them particularly suitable for industrial applications like n-butane oxidation to maleic anhydride.

金属基催化剂的组成、结构和反应条件对烷烃转化的机理和效率有显著影响：

1. 焦磷酸钒催化剂的晶体结构允许精确控制氧化能力，这对选择性氧化至关重要。

2. 当中间体的脱附被阻止时，催化剂的选择性得到优化，因为在高活性催化剂上烯烃反应的选择性较低。

3. 表面反应性通过有机分子和氧物种的吸附而被修饰。这些物种在稳态条件下的移动性是焦磷酸钒催化剂在正丁烷氧化中的一个重要特征。

4. 烷烃的活化是一个关键方面，对涉及烷烃官能化的其他多相反应具有重要意义。

5. 能够结合中间体直至产物形成（单点过程）的特定表面结构对于获得高选择性至关重要。

这些因素通过实现对反应途径的精确控制、提高选择性和允许高效的烷烃转化，为此类催化剂的工业重要性做出了贡献。焦磷酸钒催化剂的独特性质使其特别适合于工业应用，如正丁烷氧化制备顺丁烯二酸酐。
