[1] "All catalysts used industrially for the production of maleic anhydride from butane are PVO-based systems."

[2] "The vanadium phosphorus oxide system is characterized by facile formation and interconversion of a number of crystalline V(IV) and V(V) phases, and this has led to some confusion in the literature as to the nature of the active phase."

[3] "Kinetics data agree that the hydrocarbon activation is the first step in n-butane oxidation."

[4] "The TAP results suggest that the selectivity of the butane oxidation reaction is influenced by the concentration of these species at the initial butane adsorption site."

[5] "A central role in the modification of surface reactivity is adsorption of organic molecules and oxygen species. The mobility of these species under steady-state conditions of reaction is another characteristic of the vanadyl pyrophosphate catalyst in n-butane oxidation"

The composition, structure and reaction conditions of vanadium phosphorus oxide (PVO) catalysts significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiency of n-butane transformation to maleic anhydride. Key factors include:

1. Catalyst composition: PVO catalysts contain both V(IV) and V(V) phases, with the optimal ratio depending on reaction conditions. The phosphorus to vanadium ratio also affects catalyst performance.

2. Crystal structure: The vanadyl pyrophosphate phase is considered the active phase, but its exact structure and the presence of defects impact reactivity.

3. Surface properties: The concentration and type of oxygen species on the surface, as well as the adsorption of organic molecules, play a crucial role in determining catalyst activity and selectivity.

4. Reaction conditions: The butane/oxygen ratio and temperature affect the oxidation state of the catalyst surface and thus its performance.

5. Redox properties: The ability of the catalyst to undergo controlled reduction and reoxidation is key to its selectivity.

The industrial significance of PVO catalysts for n-butane oxidation stems from their unique ability to selectively activate and transform the alkane without releasing intermediates. This allows for high selectivity to maleic anhydride, which has not been matched by other catalytic systems.

While the review focuses on PVO catalysts for butane oxidation, the principles discussed regarding the importance of controlled redox properties, oxygen mobility, and surface reactivity are relevant to other metal-based catalysts for alkane transformations. However, the specific mechanisms and factors contributing to efficiency may differ for other systems such as supported vanadium oxides or metal-exchanged zeolites used in oxidative dehydrogenation or other zeolite-catalyzed reactions.

钒磷氧化物（PVO）催化剂的组成、结构和反应条件显著影响了正丁烷转化为马来酸酐的机理和效率。关键因素包括：

1. 催化剂组成：PVO催化剂含有V(IV)和V(V)相，最佳比例取决于反应条件。磷与钒的比例也影响催化剂性能。

2. 晶体结构：焦磷酸钒酰被认为是活性相，但其确切结构和缺陷的存在影响反应活性。

3. 表面性质：表面氧物种的浓度和类型，以及有机分子的吸附，在决定催化剂活性和选择性方面起着关键作用。

4. 反应条件：丁烷/氧气比例和温度影响催化剂表面的氧化态，从而影响其性能。

5. 氧化还原性质：催化剂进行可控还原和再氧化的能力是其选择性的关键。

PVO催化剂在正丁烷氧化中的工业重要性源于其独特的能力，可以选择性地活化和转化烷烃而不释放中间体。这允许对马来酸酐有高选择性，这是其他催化系统所无法匹敌的。

虽然本综述重点关注用于丁烷氧化的PVO催化剂，但关于控制氧化还原性质、氧移动性和表面反应性重要性的讨论原则也适用于其他用于烷烃转化的金属基催化剂。然而，对于其他系统，如用于氧化脱氢或其他沸石催化反应的负载型钒氧化物或金属交换沸石，具体机理和影响效率的因素可能会有所不同。
