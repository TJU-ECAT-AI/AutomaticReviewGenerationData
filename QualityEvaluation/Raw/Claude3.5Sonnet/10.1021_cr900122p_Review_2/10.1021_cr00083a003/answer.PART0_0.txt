[1] "The vanadyl pyrophosphate catalyst, due to its particular crystalline structure, shows a singular ability to control its oxidizing power."

[2] "The best selectivity is achieved when desorption of less selective intermediates along the reaction coordinate is avoided because the olefin reactions are less selective on a highly active butane (VO)2P2O7 catalyst."

[3] "The availability of oxygen to the surface is critical in avoiding desorption of less selective olefins. Thus it would appear that major selectivity gains could be achieved if more oxygen could be channeled to the active site."

[4] "A central role in the modification of surface reactivity is adsorption of organic molecules and oxygen species. The mobility of these species under steady-state conditions of reaction is another characteristic of the vanadyl pyrophosphate catalyst in n-butane oxidation"

[5] "Activation of the alkane hydrocarbon is a further important aspect of this reaction because of its mechanistic relevance in the study of other heterogeneous reactions for functionalization of alkanes"

The composition, structure and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations:

1. The crystalline structure of vanadyl pyrophosphate allows precise control of oxidizing power, which is crucial for selectivity.

2. Catalyst composition and surface properties affect intermediate desorption. Preventing desorption of less selective intermediates improves overall selectivity.

3. Oxygen availability at the catalyst surface is critical. Channeling more oxygen to active sites could potentially increase selectivity.

4. Adsorption of organic molecules and oxygen species modifies surface reactivity. The mobility of these adsorbed species under reaction conditions is an important characteristic.

5. The catalyst's ability to activate alkanes is mechanistically relevant for other heterogeneous alkane functionalization reactions.

These factors contribute to industrial significance by enabling selective oxidation of alkanes like n-butane to valuable products such as maleic anhydride. The unique structural properties and reactivity of vanadyl pyrophosphate make it particularly effective for this challenging transformation.
