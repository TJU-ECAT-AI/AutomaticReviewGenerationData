[1] "The vanadyl pyrophosphate catalyst, due to its particular crystalline structure, shows a singular ability to control its oxidizing power."

[2] "The best selectivity is achieved when desorption of less selective intermediates along the reaction coordinate is avoided because the olefin reactions are less selective on a highly active butane (VO)2P2O7 catalyst."

[3] "The availability of oxygen to the surface is critical in avoiding desorption of less selective olefins. Thus it would appear that major selectivity gains could be achieved if more oxygen could be channeled to the active site."

[4] "A central role in the modification of surface reactivity is adsorption of organic molecules and oxygen species. The mobility of these species under steady-state conditions of reaction is another characteristic of the vanadyl pyrophosphate catalyst in n-butane oxidation"

[5] "Activation of the alkane hydrocarbon is a further important aspect of this reaction because of its mechanistic relevance in the study of other heterogeneous reactions for functionalization of alkanes"

The composition, structure and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations:

1. The crystalline structure of vanadyl pyrophosphate allows precise control of oxidizing power, which is crucial for selectivity.

2. Catalyst composition and surface properties affect intermediate desorption. Preventing desorption of less selective intermediates improves overall selectivity.

3. Oxygen availability at the catalyst surface is critical. Channeling more oxygen to active sites could potentially increase selectivity.

4. Adsorption of organic molecules and oxygen species modifies surface reactivity. The mobility of these adsorbed species under reaction conditions is an important characteristic.

5. The catalyst's ability to activate alkanes is mechanistically relevant for other heterogeneous alkane functionalization reactions.

These factors contribute to industrial significance by enabling selective oxidation of alkanes like n-butane to valuable products such as maleic anhydride. The unique structural properties and reactivity of vanadyl pyrophosphate make it particularly effective for this challenging transformation.

The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations:

1. The crystalline structure of vanadyl pyrophosphate catalysts allows precise control over oxidizing power, which is crucial for selective oxidation.

2. Catalyst selectivity is optimized when intermediate desorption is prevented, as olefin reactions are less selective on highly active catalysts.

The composition, structure and reaction conditions of vanadium phosphorus oxide (PVO) catalysts significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiency of n-butane transformation to maleic anhydride. Key factors include:

1. Catalyst composition: PVO catalysts contain both V(IV) and V(V) phases, with the optimal ratio depending on reaction conditions. The phosphorus to vanadium ratio also affects catalyst performance.

2. Crystal structure: The vanadyl pyrophosphate phase is considered the active phase, but its exact structure and the presence of defects impact reactivity.

3. Surface properties: The concentration and type of oxygen species on the surface, as well as the adsorption of organic molecules, play a crucial role in determining catalyst activity and selectivity.

4. Reaction conditions: The butane/oxygen ratio and temperature affect the oxidation state of the catalyst surface and thus its performance.

5. Redox properties: The ability of the catalyst to undergo controlled reduction and reoxidation is key to its selectivity.

The industrial significance of PVO catalysts for n-butane oxidation stems from their unique ability to selectively activate and transform the alkane without releasing intermediates. This allows for high selectivity to maleic anhydride, which has not been matched by other catalytic systems.

While the review focuses on PVO catalysts for butane oxidation, the principles discussed regarding the importance of controlled redox properties, oxygen mobility, and surface reactivity are relevant to other metal-based catalysts for alkane transformations. However, the specific mechanisms and factors contributing to efficiency may differ for other systems such as supported vanadium oxides or metal-exchanged zeolites used in oxidative dehydrogenation or other zeolite-catalyzed reactions.

钒磷氧化物（PVO）催化剂的组成、结构和反应条件显著影响了正丁烷转化为马来酸酐的机理和效率。关键因素包括：

1. 催化剂组成：PVO催化剂含有V(IV)和V(V)相，最佳比例取决于反应条件。磷与钒的比例也影响催化剂性能。

2. 晶体结构：焦磷酸钒酰被认为是活性相，但其确切结构和缺陷的存在影响反应活性。

3. 表面性质：表面氧物种的浓度和类型，以及有机分子的吸附，在决定催化剂活性和选择性方面起着关键作用。

4. 反应条件：丁烷/氧气比例和温度影响催化剂表面的氧化态，从而影响其性能。

5. 氧化还原性质：催化剂进行可控还原和再氧化的能力是其选择性的关键。

PVO催化剂在正丁烷氧化中的工业重要性源于其独特的能力，可以选择性地活化和转化烷烃而不释放中间体。这允许对马来酸酐有高选择性，这是其他催化系统所无法匹敌的。

虽然本综述重点关注用于丁烷氧化的PVO催化剂，但关于控制氧化还原性质、氧移动性和表面反应性重要性的讨论原则也适用于其他用于烷烃转化的金属基催化剂。然而，对于其他系统，如用于氧化脱氢或其他沸石催化反应的负载型钒氧化物或金属交换沸石，具体机理和影响效率的因素可能会有所不同。

The composition, structure and reaction conditions of vanadium phosphorus oxide (PVO) catalysts significantly influence the mechanism and efficiency of n-butane oxidation to maleic anhydride:

1. PVO catalysts, particularly vanadyl pyrophosphate ((VO)2P2O7), are uniquely selective for this reaction due to their crystalline structure.

2. The catalyst's ability to control its oxidizing power is crucial for selectivity. This is achieved through structural site isolation of oxidizing sites.

3. Selectivity is maximized when desorption of less selective intermediates (e.g. olefins) is prevented. This requires careful control of surface oxidation state.

4. Oxygen availability at the surface is critical. Improving oxygen channeling to active sites could potentially increase selectivity.

5. Adsorption and mobility of organic molecules and oxygen species on the catalyst surface play a central role in modifying surface reactivity.

These factors contribute to the industrial significance of PVO catalysts for n-butane oxidation. The unique structural requirements for selective alkane activation and oxidation explain why other catalytic systems have not matched PVO's performance in this reaction.

[1] "Currently, worldwide production of maleic anhydride is based on the major feedstocks benzene, n-butane, and butenes."

The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts, particularly vanadium phosphorus oxide (VPO) catalysts, significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations in processes like oxidative dehydrogenation. 

VPO catalysts are the primary industrial catalysts used for maleic anhydride production from n-butane. Their effectiveness stems from their unique crystalline structure, which allows for precise control of oxidizing power. This structure is characterized by the interconversion between various V(IV) and V(V) phases.

The preparation method greatly impacts the catalyst's properties. Using organic solvents instead of aqueous systems during synthesis results in different degrees of crystallinity and defect structures in the active phase. These structural differences affect the catalyst's performance.

The reaction conditions, such as the redox potential of the feed, can cause dynamic changes in the VPO catalyst surface. This adaptability is crucial for maintaining selectivity and efficiency in the complex 14-electron oxidation of n-butane to maleic anhydride.

While the literature doesn't specifically discuss metal-exchanged zeolites or their industrial significance for alkane transformations, the principles of how catalyst composition and structure influence reaction mechanisms likely apply to other catalytic systems as well.

金属基催化剂的组成、结构和反应条件，特别是钒磷氧化物（VPO）催化剂，显著影响烷烃转化过程中的机理和效率，如氧化脱氢过程。

VPO催化剂是工业上用于从正丁烷生产顺丁烯二酸酐的主要催化剂。它们的有效性源于其独特的晶体结构，使其能够精确控制氧化能力。这种结构的特点是各种V(IV)和V(V)相之间的相互转化。

制备方法极大地影响催化剂的性能。在合成过程中使用有机溶剂而不是水系统会导致活性相中不同程度的结晶度和缺陷结构。这些结构差异影响催化剂的性能。

反应条件，如进料的氧化还原电位，可以导致VPO催化剂表面的动态变化。这种适应性对于在复杂的正丁烷到顺丁烯二酸酐的14电子氧化过程中保持选择性和效率至关重要。

虽然文献没有具体讨论金属交换沸石或它们在烷烃转化中的工业重要性，但催化剂组成和结构如何影响反应机理的原理可能也适用于其他催化系统。
