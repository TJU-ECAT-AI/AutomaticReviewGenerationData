[1] "Besides oxidative activation such as oxidative coupling of methane to C2+, non-oxidative activation of methane to produce aromatics over Mo/HZSM-5 catalysts in a continuous flow mode has attracted significant interest since 1993."

[2] "The catalysts and reaction conditions are presented. Emphasis has been focused on the modification of catalysts and optimization of reaction conditions."

[3] "The channel structure and acidity of HZSM-5 zeolite, as well as, the valence and location of Mo species are crucial factors for the catalytic performance"

[4] "Lin et al. [24] found that the acidity and reactivity of Mo/HZSM-5 decreased when Li or P was used to modify the catalyst."

[5] "Many researchers confirmed that HZSM-5 is the best support for methane dehydro-aromatization."

[6] "All the experiments showed that various pre-treatments and different reaction conditions, such as pre-treatment atmosphere [25,29,38] and temperature [28,36,40], reaction temperature [25,29], pressure [19,43], methane space velocity [24,25,28,43], and regeneration [25,36], exerted great influences on the catalytic performance."

The composition, structure and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations:

1. For methane dehydroaromatization, Mo/HZSM-5 catalysts have attracted significant interest since 1993 as an alternative to oxidative activation methods.

2. The channel structure and acidity of HZSM-5 zeolite, as well as the valence and location of Mo species, are crucial factors affecting catalytic performance. 

3. Modifying Mo/HZSM-5 with elements like Li or P can decrease its acidity and reactivity.

4. HZSM-5 has been confirmed by many researchers as the best support for methane dehydroaromatization catalysts.

5. Reaction conditions including pre-treatment atmosphere and temperature, reaction temperature, pressure, methane space velocity, and catalyst regeneration all exert great influence on catalytic performance.

6. Optimizing these catalyst properties and reaction conditions has been a major focus of research to improve the efficiency of alkane transformation processes.

While the literature does not discuss oxidative dehydrogenation specifically, the principles of tuning catalyst composition, structure and reaction conditions to influence reaction mechanisms and efficiency appear broadly applicable across alkane transformation processes. The industrial significance stems from the potential to convert methane and other alkanes into more valuable aromatic products under controlled conditions.

金属基催化剂的组成、结构和反应条件对烷烃转化的机理和效率有显著影响:

1. 对于甲烷脱氢芳构化反应，自1993年以来，Mo/HZSM-5催化剂作为氧化活化方法的替代品引起了极大的关注。

2. HZSM-5分子筛的通道结构和酸度，以及Mo物种的价态和位置，是影响催化性能的关键因素。

3. 用Li或P等元素修饰Mo/HZSM-5可降低其酸度和反应活性。

4. 许多研究人员确认HZSM-5是甲烷脱氢芳构化催化剂的最佳载体。

5. 反应条件，包括预处理气氛和温度、反应温度、压力、甲烷空速和催化剂再生等，都对催化性能有很大影响。

6. 优化这些催化剂性质和反应条件一直是研究的主要焦点，目的是提高烷烃转化过程的效率。

虽然文献没有具体讨论氧化脱氢，但调整催化剂组成、结构和反应条件以影响反应机理和效率的原理似乎广泛适用于各种烷烃转化过程。工业意义在于在受控条件下将甲烷和其他烷烃转化为更有价值的芳香族产品的潜力。
