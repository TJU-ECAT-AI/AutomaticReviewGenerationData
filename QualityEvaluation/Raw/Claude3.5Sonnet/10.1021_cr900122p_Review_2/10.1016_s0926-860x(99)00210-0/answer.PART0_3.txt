[1] "Besides oxidative activation such as oxidative coupling of methane to C2+, non-oxidative activation of methane to produce aromatics over Mo/HZSM-5 catalysts in a continuous flow mode has attracted significant interest since 1993."

[2] "The catalysts and reaction conditions are presented. Emphasis has been focused on the modification of catalysts and optimization of reaction conditions."

[3] "The results of investigations on the interactions between Mo and/or transition metal ions and the zeolite support, as well as, the reaction mechanisms of the formation of aromatics and carbonaceous deposits are discussed."

[4] "Generally speaking, the channel structure and acidity of the HZSM-5 and the valence and location of the Mo species on/in the zeolite are crucial factors for its catalytic performance."

[5] "The induction period of the reaction is commonly recognized, in which Mo6+ species possibly located on the external surface of the support are partially reduced or reduced to Mo2C, mainly yielding H2O, CO, CO2 and H2."

The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations, particularly in processes like methane dehydro-aromatization. For metal-exchanged zeolites like Mo/HZSM-5:

1. Catalyst composition: The presence of Mo species on HZSM-5 zeolite is crucial. The valence state and location of Mo species on/in the zeolite greatly affect catalytic performance.

2. Zeolite structure: The channel structure and acidity of HZSM-5 play vital roles in the reaction mechanism and efficiency.

3. Reaction conditions: Factors like temperature, pressure, and gas hourly space velocity influence the catalyst's performance and product distribution.

4. Mechanism: The reaction involves an induction period where Mo6+ species are reduced to lower oxidation states or Mo2C. This is followed by methane activation and transformation to aromatics.

5. Efficiency: The efficiency is affected by carbonaceous deposits formed during the reaction, which can lead to catalyst deactivation.

These factors contribute to the industrial significance of such catalysts by determining their activity, selectivity, and stability in alkane transformation processes. The ability to control these parameters allows for the design of more efficient catalysts for potential industrial applications in natural gas utilization.
