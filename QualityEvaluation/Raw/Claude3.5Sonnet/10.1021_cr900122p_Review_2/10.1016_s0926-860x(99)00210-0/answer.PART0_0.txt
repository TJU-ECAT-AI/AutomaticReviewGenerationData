The literature focuses on methane dehydro-aromatization over transition metal ion (TMI) modified zeolite catalysts, particularly Mo/HZSM-5, under non-oxidative conditions. Key factors influencing the mechanisms and efficiency of this alkane transformation include:

1. Catalyst composition: The use of Mo species supported on HZSM-5 zeolite is crucial.

2. Catalyst structure: The channel structure of HZSM-5 and the location of Mo species are important.

3. Reaction conditions: Optimization of conditions like temperature, pressure, and space velocity affects performance.

4. Acidity: The acidity of the HZSM-5 support plays a significant role.

5. Metal valence: The oxidation state of Mo influences catalytic activity.

6. Modifications: Addition of secondary metal components can enhance reactivity and stability.

The industrial significance of these catalysts stems from their ability to directly convert methane to valuable aromatic products without oxidants. Researchers have been working to improve reactivity, stability, and selectivity to aromatics since 1993, aiming to develop more efficient processes for utilizing natural gas resources.
