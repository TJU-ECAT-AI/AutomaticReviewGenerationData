[1] "Besides oxidative activation such as oxidative coupling of methane to C2+, non-oxidative activation of methane to produce aromatics over Mo/HZSM-5 catalysts in a continuous flow mode has attracted significant interest since 1993."

[2] "The catalysts and reaction conditions are presented. Emphasis has been focused on the modification of catalysts and optimization of reaction conditions."

[3] "The channel structure and acidity of HZSM-5 zeolite and the valence and location of Mo species are the crucial factors for the catalytic performance"

[4] "Xu et al. found that if Mo/HZSM-5 catalysts are calcined at a proper temperature such as at 773 K the Mo species would interact with the acid sites (mainly Bronsted acid sites) and part of them would move into the channel."

[5] "Generally speaking, the channel structure and acidity of the HZSM-5 and the valence and location of the Mo species on/in the zeolite are crucial factors for its catalytic performance."

The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts, particularly Mo/HZSM-5, significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations, especially in methane dehydro-aromatization. Key factors include:

1. Catalyst composition: The use of Mo as the active metal component on HZSM-5 zeolite support is crucial for methane activation and conversion to aromatics.

2. Zeolite structure: The channel structure of HZSM-5 plays a vital role in the catalytic performance, affecting the distribution and accessibility of active sites.

3. Acidity: The acidity of the HZSM-5 support, particularly Brønsted acid sites, is essential for the catalytic process.

4. Metal valence and location: The oxidation state of Mo and its distribution on the zeolite surface or within the channels significantly impact catalyst performance.

5. Preparation conditions: Calcination temperature (e.g., 773 K) affects the interaction between Mo species and acid sites, as well as the migration of Mo into zeolite channels.

6. Reaction conditions: Optimization of parameters such as temperature, pressure, and gas flow rate is crucial for improving catalyst efficiency.

These factors contribute to the industrial significance of Mo/HZSM-5 catalysts by enabling the direct conversion of methane to valuable aromatic products under non-oxidative conditions, which has attracted considerable interest since 1993 due to its potential for natural gas utilization.
