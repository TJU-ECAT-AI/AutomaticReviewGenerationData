[1] "Besides oxidative activation such as oxidative coupling of methane to C2+, non-oxidative activation of methane to produce aromatics over Mo/HZSM-5 catalysts in a continuous flow mode has attracted significant interest since 1993."

[2] "The catalysts and reaction conditions are presented. Emphasis has been focused on the modification of catalysts and optimization of reaction conditions."

[3] "The channel structure and acidity of HZSM-5 zeolite, as well as, the valence and location of Mo species are crucial factors for the catalytic performance"

[4] "The interactions between Mo and/or transition metal ions and the zeolite support, as well as, the reaction mechanisms of the formation of aromatics and carbonaceous deposits are discussed."

[5] "Xu et al. have recently shown by NH3-TPD that after introducing Mo species onto HZSM-5, the NH3 desorption peak at high temperatures (which refers to the strong sites) decreased more than the NH3 desorption peak at low temperatures, while a peak at medium temperature developed"

The composition, structure and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations:

1. For methane dehydroaromatization, Mo/HZSM-5 catalysts have attracted significant interest since 1993 as an alternative to oxidative activation methods.

2. The channel structure and acidity of HZSM-5 zeolite, as well as the valence and location of Mo species, are crucial factors affecting catalytic performance. 

3. Modification of catalysts and optimization of reaction conditions have been key areas of focus.

4. Interactions between Mo and/or transition metal ions and the zeolite support play an important role.

5. Introducing Mo species onto HZSM-5 changes the acid site distribution, decreasing strong acid sites and developing medium-strength acid sites.

6. The mechanisms of aromatics formation and carbon deposition are influenced by these catalyst properties.

7. While not specifically discussed for oxidative dehydrogenation, the principles of tuning catalyst composition and structure to influence reaction pathways likely apply there as well.

These factors contribute to the industrial significance of such catalysts by allowing researchers to optimize catalyst design for desired product selectivity, conversion efficiency, and catalyst stability. However, the literature does not provide specific information on the industrial applications or economic impact of these catalysts.

金属基催化剂的组成、结构和反应条件显著影响烷烃转化的机理和效率:

1. 对于甲烷脱氢芳构化,Mo/HZSM-5催化剂自1993年以来引起了极大的兴趣,作为氧化活化方法的替代方案。

2. HZSM-5分子筛的通道结构和酸性,以及Mo物种的价态和位置,是影响催化性能的关键因素。

3. 催化剂的改性和反应条件的优化一直是研究的重点领域。

4. Mo和/或过渡金属离子与分子筛载体之间的相互作用起着重要作用。

5. 将Mo物种引入HZSM-5会改变酸位分布,减少强酸位并发展中等强度的酸位。

6. 芳烃形成和碳沉积的机理受这些催化剂性质的影响。

7. 虽然没有具体讨论氧化脱氢,但调整催化剂组成和结构以影响反应途径的原理可能也适用于此。

这些因素通过允许研究人员优化催化剂设计以获得所需的产物选择性、转化效率和催化剂稳定性,从而提高了此类催化剂的工业重要性。然而,文献并未提供这些催化剂的具体工业应用或经济影响的信息。
