The literature does not provide specific information about metal-based catalysts, supported vanadium oxides, or metal-exchanged zeolites for alkane transformations. It mentions catalysts and reaction mechanisms for ethane aromatization, but does not go into detail about composition, structure, or reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts. The document briefly mentions modified H-ZSM-5 zeolites and promoters, as well as catalyst stability and deactivation, but does not provide sufficient information to fully answer the question about how these factors influence mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations or their industrial significance.

该文献没有提供关于金属基催化剂、负载钒氧化物或金属交换沸石用于烷烃转化的具体信息。它提到了乙烷芳构化的催化剂和反应机理,但没有详细介绍金属基催化剂的组成、结构或反应条件。文档简要提到了改性的H-ZSM-5沸石和助剂,以及催化剂的稳定性和失活,但没有提供足够的信息来全面回答这些因素如何影响烷烃转化的机理和效率或其工业重要性的问题。
