<EnglishVersionAnswer>

The literature does not provide specific information about metal-based catalysts like supported vanadium oxides or metal-exchanged zeolites for alkane transformations. It focuses more broadly on catalysts for converting lower paraffins, particularly ethane aromatization using modified H-ZSM-5 zeolites. The document discusses considerations in choosing catalysts, the use of promoters, reaction mechanisms, and catalyst stability/deactivation, but does not go into detail about the composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts or their influence on oxidative dehydrogenation. The industrial significance of these processes is not explicitly addressed in the given excerpts.

该文献没有提供关于金属基催化剂(如负载的钒氧化物或金属交换的沸石)用于烷烃转化的具体信息。它更广泛地关注了低级烷烃转化的催化剂,特别是使用改性H-ZSM-5沸石进行乙烷芳构化。文档讨论了选择催化剂的考虑因素、促进剂的使用、反应机理以及催化剂的稳定性/失活,但没有详细介绍金属基催化剂的组成、结构和反应条件,或它们对氧化脱氢的影响。在给出的摘录中没有明确提到这些过程的工业重要性。
