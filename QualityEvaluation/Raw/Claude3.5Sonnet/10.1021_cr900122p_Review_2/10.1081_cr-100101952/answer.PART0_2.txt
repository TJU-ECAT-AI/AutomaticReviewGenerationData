The literature provided does not contain specific information about metal-based catalysts, supported vanadium oxides, or metal-exchanged zeolites in relation to alkane transformations. The document appears to focus on ethane to aromatic hydrocarbon conversion, primarily using H-ZSM-5 zeolites. It mentions considerations for choosing catalysts, the use of promoters in modified H-ZSM-5, reaction mechanisms for ethane aromatization, and catalyst stability and deactivation. However, it does not provide detailed information about the composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts or their influence on oxidative dehydrogenation and other zeolite-catalyzed reactions. The document also does not discuss factors contributing to their industrial significance in the context of the question asked.

所提供的文献并不包含关于金属基催化剂、负载钒氧化物或金属交换沸石在烷烃转化方面的具体信息。该文档似乎主要关注乙烷到芳烃的转化，主要使用H-ZSM-5沸石。它提到了选择催化剂的考虑因素、改性H-ZSM-5中促进剂的使用、乙烷芳构化的反应机理以及催化剂的稳定性和失活。然而，它没有提供关于金属基催化剂的组成、结构和反应条件，以及它们对氧化脱氢和其他沸石催化反应的影响的详细信息。该文档也没有讨论在所问问题的背景下对它们的工业重要性有贡献的因素。
