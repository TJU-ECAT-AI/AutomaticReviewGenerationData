[1] "ZSM-5 zeolites modified with Cu+ ions were prepared either by the high-temperature chemical reaction of hydrogen form with CuCl vapour or by the wet ion exchange with subsequent reduction of the modified samples in CO at 873 K."

[2] "Adsorption of H2, N2 or C2H6 by Cu+ ions was studied by DRIFTS and by volumetric technique. The conclusions about the structure of adsorption complexes were supported by the DFT cluster quantum chemical calculations."

[3] "The DFT cluster modelling indicated that both adsorption of hydrogen and ethane could be explained by interaction with the isolated Cu+ ions localized at the a sites of the ZSM-5 framework."

[4] "Quantum chemical calculations indicated the important role in the bonding of adsorbed hydrogen and ethane of electron back donation from dp-orbitals of Cu+ ions to the s*HH or CH orbitals."

[5] "The copper modified ZSM-5 zeolits (CuZSM-5) are known to exhibit a high-catalytic activity in selective decomposition of NO into molecular oxygen and nitrogen"

The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts, particularly Cu-ZSM-5 zeolites, significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations. Key factors include:

1. Preparation method: Cu-ZSM-5 can be prepared by high-temperature reaction with CuCl vapor or wet ion exchange followed by CO reduction at 873 K. This affects the distribution and nature of Cu+ sites.

2. Cu+ ion location: Isolated Cu+ ions localized at a-sites in the ZSM-5 framework play a crucial role in adsorption and catalysis.

3. Electronic interactions: Electron back-donation from Cu+ dp-orbitals to adsorbate antibonding orbitals (s*HH or CH) is important for strong adsorption of H2 and C2H6.

4. Adsorption properties: Cu-ZSM-5 exhibits unusually strong adsorption of H2, N2, and C2H6, which affects reactivity.

5. Catalytic activity: Cu-ZSM-5 shows high catalytic activity for NO decomposition, demonstrating its potential in environmental applications.

These factors contribute to the industrial significance of Cu-ZSM-5 by enabling strong molecule activation, tunable catalytic properties, and potential applications in environmental catalysis and hydrocarbon transformations.
