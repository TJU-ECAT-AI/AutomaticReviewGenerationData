Abstract
ZSM-5 zeolites modified with Cu+ ions were prepared either by the high-temperature chemical reaction of hydrogen form with CuCl vapour or
by the wet ion exchange with subsequent reduction of the modified samples in CO at 873 K. Adsorption of H2, N2 or C2H6 by Cu+ ions was studied
by DRIFTS and by volumetric technique. The conclusions about the structure of adsorption complexes were supported by the DFT cluster quantum
chemical calculations. The obtained results indicated that in addition to the previously reported strong adsorption of nitrogen, the univalent copper
also unusually strongly adsorbs molecular hydrogen and ethane. Adsorption of hydrogen is the most amazing since the observed low-frequency
shifts of the HH stretching vibrations were as high as about 1000 cm1. This is quite different from much weaker H2 perturbation by Cu2+ cations.
Adsorption of ethane by Cu+ ions also resulted in the low-frequency shifts of some of CH IR stretching bands up to 400 cm1. The DFT cluster
modelling indicated that both adsorption of hydrogen and ethane could be explained by interaction with the isolated Cu+ ions localized at the a sites
of the ZSM-5 framework. Quantum chemical calculations indicated the important role in the bonding of adsorbed hydrogen and ethane of electron
back donation from dp-orbitals of Cu+ ions to the s*HH or CH orbitals. The overall yield of Cu+ sites of the strong H2 or N2 adsorption is about
twice lower than the total copper content.

1. Introduction
The copper modified ZSM-5 zeolits (CuZSM-5) are known to
exhibit a high-catalytic activity in selective decompositionof NO
into molecular oxygen and nitrogen [13]. They also possess
very unusual adsorption properties, resulting in formation of a
very strong adsorption complexes of the univalent copper cations
with N2 [4,5] or CO molecules [6]. The Cu+ adsorption centers
could be formed both in an indirect way via reduction of dimeric
oxygen-bridged [CuOCu]2+ species in CO or directly by high-
temperature reaction of the hydrogen form with CuCl vapour at
elevated temperature [4,79].
Earlier in our works [1019], low-temperature dihydrogen
adsorption has been suggested as a very sensitive tool for the
study of different cationic sites in the zeolites. The values of the
low-frequency shifts of the IR HH stretching bands were used
in this case as a measure of the polarizing ability of cations. It
was demonstrated that adsorption of H2 by alkaline or alkali-
earth cations results in a rather weak perturbation of adsorbed
molecules, while the red shifts of HH stretching bands, usually
do not exceed 100150 cm1. In contrast, such strong Lewis
acid sites as Zn2+ or Cd2+ cations stabilized in the structure of
high-silica zeolites perturb adsorbed H2 much stronger [1719].
In this case, the low-frequency shifts are as high as 220 cm1.
This testifies a very strong polarization of the HH bond that
results in subsequent heterolytic dissociative adsorption of
hydrogen at elevated temperatures. However, in all these cases
adsorption heats were relatively low, since the study of H2
adsorption was possible only at liquid nitrogen temperature. In
contrast, hydrogen adsorption, that was recently reported in
refs. [20,21] for the reduced over-exchanged CuZSM-5 zeolite,
is quite different. It results in low-frequency shifts of the HH
stretching vibrations by about 1000 cm1. Such large shifts
have never been reported before for H2 adsorbed by any oxide

or any cationic form of zeolite. Similar results were also
obtained for H2 adsorption by CuZSM-5 prepared via high-
temperature reaction with CuCl vapour [22,23].
On the other hand, during last 20 years, a great number of
transition
metal
complexes
containing
intact
molecular
dihydrogen have been reported [2432]. These systems
constitute a special class of s-bond complexes. The vibrational
properties of the MH2 moiety in such s-bonded hydrogen
complexes were discussed in refs. [2527,30]. They are very
similar to those observed in refs. [2023] for H2 adsorption by
CuZSM-5 zeolite. Therefore, it is most likely, that the bonding
of adsorbed H2 with Cu+ could be described in the similar way.
Indeed, analysis of the components of adsorption energy of H2
by Cu+ cations, carried out within the cluster approach by
Solans-Monfort et al. [22], revealed the s-bonding of adsorbed
hydrogen. In this case, the electron donation from the H2(sg)
bonding orbital to the low-occupied Cu(4s) orbital is combined
with the electron back-donation from the (3dp) Cu+ orbital to
the antibonding H2s
u orbital, while the orbital polarization
plays a significant role in the H2 adsorption energy. This causes
the above-mentioned very large batochromic HH frequency
shifts.
Our recent investigations of hydrogen and light alkanes
adsorption by different cationic forms of zeolites [1019,33
35] also showed, that the ion exchanged transition metal cations
usually exhibit very similar adsorption properties with respect
both to H2 and light paraffins (see, for instance, refs. [19,34]).
However, most of these works were aimed on the study of
interaction of adsorbed molecules with the strong Lewis acids
when no donoracceptor complexes were formed upon
adsorption. Therefore, in the present work, we carried out
the parallel IR study of molecular hydrogen and ethane
adsorption by Cu+ ions in CuZSM-5 zeolites with different Si/
Al ratio in the framework. DFT modelling of adsorption
complexes was also carried in parallel in order to analyze
hydrogen and ethane bonding with Cu+ ions stabilized in the
zeolite lattice.
In this connection one should note, that despite numerous
observations of H2 s-complexes [36,37], no similar series of the
stable complexes with transition metals have been previously
reported for light alkanes. All of the alkane complexes so far
detected are unstable at room temperature and rather specific
methods are required for their preparation and detection.
Indeed, the first examples of alkane coordination by
transition metals were reported upon application of the matrix
isolation technique in the photochemistry of the d6 M(CO)6
carbonyls (M Cr, Mo, W) [38,39]. The coordination of alkanes
to M(CO)5 fragment has also been observed by transient
absorption technique in solution or in the gas phase in refs. [40
42]. More recently, the coordination of methane by the naked
transition metal atoms has been directly observed in the low-
temperature matrices. Experiments on the oxidative addition
and reductive elimination of alkanes from transition metal
complexes also revealed the formation of alkane complexes as
reaction intermediates [37,43]. The complexes with light
alkanes have been also subjected to theoretical calculations in
refs. [37,44], both as intermediates in CH activation, or as the
independent entities. However, direct observation of these
species has not been reported yet.
2. Experimental
Initial hydrogen forms of SN-55 or SN-300 ZSM-5 zeolites
from Alsi Penta with Si/Al ratio in the framework of about
22 and 150, respectively, were prepared by decomposition of
the corresponding ammonium forms in flowing oxygen at
773 K. Modification of the zeolites with the univalent copper
was carried out either via reduction of dimeric oxygen-bridged
[CuOCu]2+ species prepared by the wet ion over exchange or
directly by the reaction of the hydrogen form with CuCl vapour
at high temperature. In the latter case a high Si/Al ratio of 150
was chosen in order to minimize the interaction between copper
species inside the zeolite channels, which could lead to
formation of bivalent copper cations via the following
disproportion reaction:
2ZCu ! Cu0  ZCu2Z
(1)
The ion-exchanged copper containing (Cu/H-ZSM-5red)
samples were prepared by triple wet ion exchange of the
ammonium form of the SN-55 zeolite (Si/Al = 22) with 0.02 M
copper acetate aqueous solution. After third exchange the
material was washed in distilled water and dried at 380 K.
According to the atomic absorption spectral analysis (AAS),
the copper content in the sample was equal to 2.5 wt.%. This
value corresponds to Cu/Al ratio of 0.6. Calcination and
reduction treatments of the modified samples were performed
under static conditions directly in the IR cell. The calcination
was carried out in oxygen at the pressure of 13.3 kPa at 773 K
for 1 h. The reduction in CO was performed at 873 K for three
times (each time for 0.5 h) in the static conditions at the CO
pressure of 13.3 kPa (the Cu/H-ZSM-5red sample).
The Cu(I)-ZSM-5 sample was prepared directly by reaction
of HZSM-5 with the CuCl vapour at 573 K following the
procedure previously described in ref. [8]. This was done in the
same quartz optical cell that was subsequently used for DRIFTS
measurements. For this purpose, the optical cell was equipped
with a side arm with CaF2 window and an appendix, containing
CuCl (Merck) that was previously evacuated at 473 K in order
to remove any traces of water. At first, the zeolite was heated in
vacuum at 393 K for 2 h with the rate of preliminary
temperature increase of 2 K/min. Then the temperature was
raised with the same heating rate to 773 K and the samples were
evacuated at this temperature for two more hours. After that
HZSM-5 was transferred into the appendix with CuCl and
heated in vacuum at 573 K. At the end of HCl evolution the
modified zeolite was transferred back into the main part of the
quartz cell and was evacuated for two more hours at 773 K in
order to remove the excess of the copper chloride.
H2 and N2 adsorption was studied for both Cu/H-ZSM-5 and
Cu(I)-ZSM-5
samples,
whereas
DRIFT
study
of
C2H6
adsorption was performed only for the sample prepared via
high-temperature reaction with copper(I) chloride.
Diffuse-reflectance (DRIFT) and transmittance IR measure-
ments were carried out using a Nicolet Impact 410

282
spectrophotometer
equipped
with
a
home-made
diffuse
reflectance attachment. The DRIFTS measurements were
preformed for the granulated zeolites with dimensions of
grains of ca. 0.20.5 mm. The spectra of adsorbed N2 and C2H6
were recorded at room temperature trough a CaF2 window,
while those of adsorbed hydrogen either at room temperature or
at 77 K. In the latter case, the quartz optical sell was immersed
into a quartz Dewar flask filled with liquid nitrogen. All of the
spectra were transformed into KubelkaMunk units by a
standard program assuming that the reflectance ability of the
samples at 5000 cm1 was equal to 0.9. Then the background
created by the zeolite was subtracted from the overall spectra.
The transmittance measurements were performed for the self-
supported pellets pressed from the zeolite powders also using
the quartz IR cell with CaF2 windows.
The numbers of sites of strong H2 and N2 adsorption were
evaluated from adsorption isotherms of both these gases, which
were measured volumetrically at 293 K. It was accepted that at
room temperature adsorption of molecular hydrogen by the
residual acidic hydroxyls or by Lewis Al3+ sites was very weak
and did not contribute into adsorption of H2 by the Cu+ ions.
Their number was estimated by extracting of the Langmuir
parts from the entire adsorption isotherms.
The quantum chemical calculations were carried out within
the gradient-corrected density functional theory (DFT) using
the GAUSSIAN-98 program [45]. The hybrid B3LYP [46]
functional was used in these calculations, since it gives
acceptable values for molecular energies and geometries [47].
All of the calculations were performed using standard 631 G
(d, p) basis set for all atoms of the cluster modelling the
adsorption site and for the adsorbed C2H6, N2 or H2 species.
The six-membered ring composed of two five-membered
rings from the walls of the straight channels of the ZSM-5
zeolite (the a-site) was chosen as a possible site both for Cu+
and Cu2+ localization. This model was selected since it has been
discussed by experimentalists to explain unusual catalytic and
chemical properties of univalent copper exchanged into high-
silica zeolites [48]. Using the QM-pot approach, Nachtigallova
et al. [49] have also shown theoretically that this site is among
the most stable for the Cu+ localization. The DFT modelling
was performed for the CuAlSi6O8H
12 clusters, with Al atoms
placed in either T2 (Fig. 1(a)), T1 (Fig. 1(b)) or T4 (Fig. 1(c))
lattice positions. Below these structures will be designated as
Cu+ZI
, Cu+ZII
 and Cu+ZIII
, respectively. For modelling of
the Cu2+ at the a-site of ZSM-5 the CuAlSi5O8H
12 cluster
(Cu2+Z2, Fig. 1(d)) was used.
To saturate the dangling SiO bonds at the borders of these
clusters hydrogen atoms were used. By analogy with ref. [50],
special restrictions were imposed on the procedure of
optimization of their positions. At first, the structure of
initial zeolite cluster was constrained according to the X-ray
diffraction data [51]. Then only SiH* and AlH* bond
lengths and position of the copper ion were optimized, while
positions of other atoms as well as directions of the chemical
bonds were fixed according to crystallographic data. The
copper cation was allowed to move freely. The positions
of H* atoms in all subsequent calculations were then fixed,
while those of the remaining atoms of the cluster were
optimized.
The calculated adsorption energies were corrected for the
zero-point energies (ZPE) obtained from the vibrational mode
calculations, whereas the correction for the basis set super-

 and (d) Cu2+Z2 clusters.
position error (BSSE) was not included due to very significant
changes of the optimized clusters geometry after adsorption.
To investigate the orbital distribution of electrons and to
estimate the energies of donoracceptor interactions in the
ethane adsorption complexes with Cu+ ions, the population
analysis was performed using Natural Bond Orbital method
program that has been attached to the GAUSSIAN-98 package.
According to the ref. [52], this method allows a rather
reasonable description of different types of interatomic
interactions and discrimination of their types, as well as
analysis of the orbital populations and orbital energies.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. DRIFTS and volumetric study of H2 adsorption by
ZSM-5 zeolites modified by wet ion exchange or by
high-temperature reaction with CuCl vapour
DRIFT spectra of OH groups in the initial hydrogen form of
ZSM-5 with Si/Al = 22 or in the zeolite modified with copper
by wet ion-exchange from the aqueous solution of Cu(OAc)2
with subsequent reduction in CO at 873 K (Cu/H-ZSM-5red) are
shown in Fig. 2(a and b), respectively. In agreement with the
literature data [18], both of them contain the narrow band at
3610 cm1 from the isolated acidic hydroxyl groups and a
much weaker band with the maximum at 3740 cm1 from the
silanol groups. A very broad band with the maximum at
29003600 cm1 also belongs to the acidic OH groups,
which are hydrogen-bonded to the basic oxygen atoms of the
zeolite framework.
DRIFT spectra in Fig. 2 indicated that the wet ion-exchange
resulted in substitution of about 60% of protons by copper. On
the other hand, according to the AAS analysis the copper
content in the Cu/H-ZSM-5 sample was equal to 2.5 wt.%. For
the zeolite with the Si/Al ratio of 22 this value just corresponds
to substitution by Cu+ ions of about 60% of OH groups. In
contrast, substitution of 60% of OH groups with bivalent copper
cations should result in a twice lower copper loading, i.e. only
of 1.25 wt.%. Therefore, there is no doubt that after reduction in
CO, the predominant part of copper in the ion-exchanged
sample was transformed into Cu+ cations. This conclusion well
agrees with the previously reported literature data on reduction
of bivalent copper in CO or on its self-reduction after vacuum
treatment at high temperature [5,6,5355].
As follows from Fig. 3, the reaction of HZSM-5 with CuCl at
573 K with subsequent evacuation of the sample at 773 K
resulted in quantitative substitution of all acidic protons by the
univalent copper ions. Indeed, such pretreatment completely
destroyed both the narrow OH-band at 3610 cm1 and the
broad band in the region of 29003600 cm1. In contrast, the
silanol groups were not involved in the reaction with copper
chloride, since the intensity of the band at 3740 cm1 did not
change.
Fig. 4(ad) shows DRIFT spectra of hydrogen adsorbed at
77 K by the Cu/H-ZSM-5 sample after different pretreatments.
The band at 4105 was earlier reported for low-temperature H2
adsorption on the non-modified HZSM-5 [17,18]. Therefore, it
belongs to H2 adsorption by the residual acidic OH groups. A

much weaker band at 4175 cm1 corresponds to the high-
frequency satellite of the band at 4105 cm1, while the broad
band at 4030 cm1 is due to hydrogen adsorption by the Lewis
acid sites formed due to partial dehydroxylation of the zeolite
upon high-temperature vacuum pretreatment [17].
The
low-frequency bands at
3075,
3125,
3300 and
2630 cm1 are connected with hydrogen adsorption by Cu+
ions. One should note that such dramatic low-frequency shifts
of HH stretching vibrations indicate a very strong perturbation
of adsorbed H2. The similar low values of HH stretching
vibrational frequencies have been observed only for transition
metal dihydrogen complexes in solutions [2527,30] or for
CuCl complex with H2 stabilized in the argon matrix [56] and
were never reported for H2 adsorbed by any cation exchanged
zeolite or oxide.
The reduced copper sites of the strong perturbation of
adsorbed hydrogen can be easily destroyed by calcinations of
the sample in oxygen at 873 K. As follows from Fig. 4(b), such
treatment results in almost complete disappearance of all low-
frequency HH stretching bands. Instead a new band appeared
at 4070 cm1 that, most likely, belongs to H2 adsorbed by
[Cu2+OCu2+] oxo-species formed via oxidation of two
adjacent Cu+ cations. Evacuation of the oxidized sample at
873 K (Fig. 4(c)) partially restores the intensity of the low-
frequency bands most likely due to destruction of the oxo-
species. Subsequent reduction in CO leads to the further
increase of the low-frequency bands of adsorbed hydrogen in
intensity. The simultaneous elimination of the band at
4070 cm1 (Fig. 4(d)) testifies subsequent reduction of the
oxo-bridging copper species.
In the similar way, a set of the low-frequency bands at 3075,
3125, 3300 and 2635 cm1 also appeared upon hydrogen
adsorption on the Cu(I)-ZSM-5 sample with Si/Al = 150
(Fig. 5). As already indicated above, the band of adsorbed
hydrogen at 4105 cm1 usually is ascribed to interaction with
acidic OH groups. However, as follows from Fig. 3(b), all of
them were destroyed in the Cu(I)-ZSM-5 zeolite by reaction
with CuCl vapour. Therefore, instead, this band should be
rather ascribed to H2 molecules only slightly perturbed via
adsorption by some inactive copper species, while the HH
stretching frequency of adsorbed hydrogen occasionally
coincided in this case with that for adsorption on acidic protons.
Anyway, these results definitely indicate that the unusually
strongly low-frequency shifted DRIFT bands belong to
hydrogen molecules, which are very strongly perturbed by
interaction with Cu+ cations. The amazing feature of this
unusual form of hydrogen adsorption is that both for Cu/H-
ZSM-5red
and
Cu(I)-ZSM-5
samples
the
corresponding
DRIFTS bands are observed even at room temperature
(Figs. 6 and 7, respectively), while for both these zeolites
the positions of the bands of hydrogen adsorbed at room
temperature and at 77 K are very close to each other.
For the Cu/HZSM-5red sample prepared via wet ion
exchange we also recorded the transmittance IR spectrum of
hydrogen adsorbed at room temperature (Fig. 8). This allowed
observation of additional bands at lower frequencies with
maxima at 1395 and 1810 cm1. Similar to the other bands of

adsorbed hydrogen, both of them can be removed by evacuation
at room temperature. Therefore, they definitely belong to the
same adsorbed species as the rest of DRIFT bands of adsorbed
hydrogen.
By analogy with the vibrational spectra of the transition
metal dihydrogen complexes [2527,30], we ascribe the band at
1395 cm1, to the symmetric vibration of the CuH2 moiety,
relative to Cu+ ions, while the band at 1810 cm1 to the
corresponding asymmetric vibration that changes orientation of
hydrogen molecule relative to the adsorption site (Fig. 9).
Similar to ref. [22] we also ascribe the bands at 3082 and
3125 cm1 to the HH stretching vibrations of the very strongly
perturbed H2 molecules adsorbed by Cu+ cations. The more
convincing arguments for such assignments will be provided by
results of our DFT modelling of adsorption complexes, we
discuss in the next paragraph.
To evaluate the number of the sites of the strong dihydrogen
adsorption, we measured hydrogen adsorption isotherms The
obtained results indicated that for the Cu/H-ZSM-5red sample
the fraction of Cu+ sites strongly adsorbing H2 molecules
corresponds to about 0.45 of the total copper content, while for
the sample prepared by the high-temperature reaction with
CuCl vapour to about 0.37 (see Table 1). We also found that
both for the Cu/H-ZSM-5red and for the Cu(I)-ZSM-5 samples
the preliminary nitrogen adsorption at room temperature
eliminated the DRIFT bands of adsorbed hydrogen. Therefore,
one can conclude that the sites of both the stronger nitrogen
adsorption and the weaker hydrogen adsorption are the same
Cu+ ions.
On the other hand, only about twice lower amounts of
hydrogen and nitrogen adsorption in comparison with the total
copper content, indicate that about one-half of the modifying
Cu+ ions are accessible for both N2 and H2 molecules.
Moreover, about 20% of the Cu+ sites of the strong dinitrogen
adsorption are inactive with respect to hydrogen adsorption.
This indicates that the Cu+ cations are strongly inhomogeneous
and exhibit different adsorption properties. Such inhomogenity
could be explained by different coordination and accessibility
or by different
binding properties
of univalent copper
depending on different localization in the ZSM-5 framework.
3.2. The DFT cluster modelling of H2 and N2 adsorption by
Cu+ cations stabilized at the a-position of ZSM-5 zeolite
In order of more convincing assignment of the above
presented spectral results, we performed the DFT modelling of
N2 and H2 adsorption by Cu+ cations stabilized in three different
clusters (Fig. 1(ac)). Their geometry is similar to that one of a-
sites in ZSM-5 zeolite, but the clusters differ in localization of
aluminium atoms. The optimized CuO bond lengths obtained
by these calculations are summarized in Table 2.
As one could expect, the copper cations are localized in
Cu+ZI
 and Cu+ZII
 clusters more closely to Al atoms.
Therefore, despite of the effective coordination number of Cu+
by the zeolitic oxygen atoms equal to 3, the bond lengths with
two oxygen atoms adjacent to the aluminium are somewhat
shorter compared with the third CuO bond. In contrast, for the
Cu+ZIII
 cluster the copper cation is very strongly shielded by
the surrounding relatively closely located O4, O5 and O7
atoms. The calculated structures of dihydrogen adsorption
complexes with Cu+ cation for Cu+ZI
, Cu+ZII
 and Cu+ZIII
clusters are shown in Fig. 10(ac), respectively, while Table 3
documents the H2 adsorption energies, the calculated HH
stretching frequencies and the interatomic distances of the Cu
H2 moiety.
The obtained results indicated that adsorption of H2 by all
three clusters via the end-on (h1) adsorption fashion is non
realistic, since optimization of geometry leads to formation of
h2-adsorption s-complexes. The calculations also indicated,
that adsorption of H2 by both Cu+ZI
 and Cu+ZII
 clusters is
much stronger (15.49 and 20.83 kcal/mol, respectively) than by
the Cu+ZIII
 cluster (0.83 kcal/mol). This results in the
considerable elongation of the HH bond in comparison with
the free H2 molecule and, thereupon, in a very large
batochromic shifts of the corresponding stretching frequencies.
The calculated adsorption heats testify formation of the rather
strong donoracceptor [Cu+(h2-H2)] complexes and are in a
good agreement with the previously reported theoretical results
obtained by Solans-Monfort et al. [22].
The calculated frequencies are also in a good agreement
with the above-discussed experimental data and permit a more
precise assignment of DRIFT bands of adsorbed hydrogen.

Similar to ref. [22] we attribute the bands at 3075 and
3125 cm1 to the HH stretching vibrations of hydrogen
adsorbed by the isolated Cu+ cations in the Cu+ZI
 and Cu+ZII
clusters. The band at 1395 cm1 most likely belongs to the
symmetric vibration of the H2 molecule relative to adsorption
site as a whole. Respectively, the band at 1810 cm1 is most
likely due to the asymmetric CuH2 bending vibration that
changes orientation of adsorbed hydrogen (Fig. 9). The weaker
band at 2630 cm1 could be ascribed to the overtone of the
band at 1390 cm1 from the symmetric CuH2 vibrations. The
assignment of the band at 3300 cm1 at present is still
disputable. Solans-Monfort et al. [22] supposed that this band
belongs to H2 adsorbed by residual CuCl. However, the present
experimental data shows that it is observed both for the sample

prepared via high-temperature reaction of HZSM-5 with
copper(I) chloride and for the wet ion-exchanged sample.
Therefore, we suggest that this band belongs to H2 adsorbed by
the exchanged Cu+ cations.
One can also emphasize that formation of the [Cu+(h2-H2)]
adsorption complexes leads to the significant changes in the
geometry of the adsorption sites. For both Cu+ZI
 and Cu+ZII
clusters the Cu+ ion partially leaves the initial cationic site upon
hydrogen adsorption, while its coordination number to the
lattice oxygen atoms becomes equal to 2. In contrast,
adsorption of hydrogen by Cu+ cation in the Cu+ZIII
 cluster
that is strongly shielded with the surrounding lattice oxygens
results neither in any significant perturbation of H2 molecule,
nor in the change of the adsorption site geometry (Tables 2 and
3). Indeed, the calculated HH bond length increased in this
case only by 2%, while the HH stretching frequency decreased
in comparison with the free H2 less than by 1% (Table 3). The
calculated adsorption energy is also very low (only 0.83 kcal/
mol).
In the similar way, according to the DFT modelling, H2
adsorption by the bivalent copper in Cu2+Z2 (Fig. 11) cluster
also does not lead to any significant changes of this adsorption
site in the geometry (Table 2). The changes, which occur in the
H2 moiety, are also very minor: the length of the HH bond
increased only by 2% in comparison with the similar value
calculated for the free H2 molecule, while the HH frequency
decreased less than by 2% (Table 3). In this case, adsorption
most likely results from polarization of hydrogen by the
electrostatic field of Cu2+ cation, while the copper-to-hydrogen
back donation is very unlikely.
Similar to H2 adsorption, we also performed the DFT
modelling of N2 adsorption by Cu+ cations in the same Cu+ZI
,
Cu+ZII
 or Cu+ZIII
 clusters. In agreement with the earlier
publishedresults [4,5], we concluded that N2 isadsorbed via end-
on fashion. The calculated adsorption structures are presented in
Fig. 12(ac), while Table 3 documents the N2 adsorption
energies, the calculated NN stretching frequencies and the
interatomic distances of the CuN2 moiety. The obtained values
are in a reasonably good agreement with the previously reported
experimental and theoretical data [45,1112]. However, unlike
for H2, the N2 adsorption energies for all of these clusters are
considerablyhigher anddonotsostronglydepend onpositionsof
Al atoms in the clusters. Moreover, the values of the NN
stretching frequencies for all these structures are very close to
each other. We suggest that more strong adsorption of N2
compared to H2 adsorption results in less sensitivity of nitrogen
as a molecular probe.
Thus, the results of our DFT modelling explain inhomo-
geneity of Cu+ adsorption sites even for the simplest example of
a-sites with different localization of aluminum atoms. These
sites certainly correspond only to one of the possibilities of
copper localization. However, even this simplest model
illustrates the possible origin of inhomogeneity. We also
suggest that the Cu+ sites of the stronger N2 adsorption, which
are inactive with respect to adsorbed H2 molecules could be
strongly shielded with the surrounding oxygen atoms Cu+ ions.
Most likely, that the band at 4105 cm1 in the DRIFT spectra of
hydrogen adsorbed by Cu(I)-ZSM-5 (Fig. 12(b)) belongs just to
such sites.

3.3. Combined DRIFTS and DFT study of ethane
adsorption by Cu+ cations in the copper modified
ZSM-5 zeolite
DRIFT spectra of ethane adsorbed by Cu(I)-ZSM-5 at the
relatively high-equilibrium pressures are shown in Fig. 13(a).
They contain the following DRIFTS CH stretching bands: the
strong narrow bands at 2974, 2941, 2920 and 2878 cm1; the
weak band at 2738 cm1; and two weak broad bands with the
maxima at 2642 and 2584 cm1. The former four bands are
similar to those previously reported in our study for ethane
adsorption by the hydrogen form of ZSM-5 zeolite or for the
weak physical ethane adsorption by ZnZSM-5 [34]. Therefore,
we also ascribe them to the C2H6 molecules weakly perturbed
inside the ZSM-5 channels.
One can also see from comparison of the spectra in
Fig. 13(a and b) that upon lowering of ethane pressure, the
intensities of the bands at 2642 and 2584 cm1 changed quite
slightly. At the same time, the intensities of the high-
frequency bands from weakly perturbed C2H6 very strongly
decreased and, instead, several new slightly shifted narrow
bands with the maxima at 2989, 2949 and 2892 cm1 become
apparent at very low pressures. Thus, the overall DRIFT
spectra in Fig. 13(a) correspond to superposition of at
least two different forms of weaker and stronger ethane
adsorption.
The simultaneous decreasing in intensities of the bands at
2989, 2949 and 2892 cm1 with those of the low-frequency
bands at 2642 and 2584 cm1 shows that all of them belong to
the same form of ethane adsorption by the univalent copper
cations. This form predominates at low pressure and, most
likely, the dotted line in Fig. 13(b) represents the individual
DRIFT spectra of CH stretching vibrations of ethane
specifically adsorbed by Cu+ cations.
The appearance of the very strongly red shifted bands in this
spectra is most striking. Recently, we also observed the similar
very strong batachromic shift by more than 220 cm1 for n1C
H stretching vibrations in the DRIFT spectrum of ethane
adsorbed by the zinc modified ZSM-5 zeolite [34]. However,
adsorption of ethane by the positively charged Zn2+ cations also
resulted in enormously high intensity of this band in
comparison with the other bands from CH stretching
vibrations. It was suggested that this effect is connected with
the selective polarization of the corresponding CH vibrational

mode, which, in turn, led to the heterolytic dissociative
adsorption of ethane at elevated temperatures.
In contrast, as one can see from Fig. 13(b), despite of even
larger low-frequency shift of the CH vibrations, the relative
intensities of these most strongly red shifted bands is quite low.
In addition, the heating of the copper modified sample in ethane
atmosphere at elevated temperature up to 673 K did not result in
heterolytic dissociative adsorption. Instead such treatment
resulted in the strong darkening of the sample that testified
reduction of Cu+ cations into copper metal and made the
subsequent DRIFT study of ethane adsorption impossible.
These results and the lower polarizing ability of Cu+ cations
in comparison with the Zn2+ cations with the only partially
compensated positive charge [18,19] definitely indicate that the
unusually strong perturbation of ethane by univalent copper
ions has nothing in common with polarization of adsorbed
molecules. Instead, very strong low-frequency shifts of CH
stretching vibrations of ethane adsorbed by Cu+ ions should be
explained by some other reasons.
As it was already discussed above, adsorption of dihydrogen
by the copper modified ZSM-5 zeolite results in formation of
rather strong s-type [Cu+(h2-H2)]Z complexes (by the h2-
structure, we mean two hydrogen atoms bounded to the copper
cation). The bonding of H2 in such complexes results from a
combination of the ligand-to-metal electron donation from H2
s-orbital to the partially occupied Cu+ s-orbital combined with
the metal-to-ligand back donation from the copper dp-orbital to
the H2 s*-orbital. Both of these interactions lead to the very
strong weakening of the HH bond and, therefore, explain a
very strong red shift of the HH stretching vibrations.
Below we also suggest to explain DRIFT spectra of ethane
adsorbed by Cu+ cations with unusually strongly low-frequency
shifted CH DRIFT bands by formation of the similar s-
complexes. In this connection, it is possible to consider two
following h1 and h2 alternative structures for ethane adsorption
by Cu+ ions: (Fig. 14). The h3 structure is not considered due to

only partial removal for the C3v geometry of degeneration of C
H stretching vibrations. Therefore, in contradiction with our
experimental results, the corresponding DRIFT spectrum
should contain only four IR bands. In contrast, formation of
both h1 and h2 complexes should result in the stronger lowering
of the symmetry of adsorbed ethane from D3d to Cs. One can
also suggest that for the h1-structure the electron donation from
s CH orbital to the partially occupied s-copper orbital should
be
less
effective
due
to
much
lower
overlap
of
the
corresponding orbitals. Therefore, the h2 structure may be
favoured.
These expectations were tested by the DFT modelling of
C2H6 adsorption by the Cu+ZII
 cluster. The obtained
optimized structures of [Cu+(h1-C2H6)]Z and [Cu+(h2-
C2H6)]Z
complexes
are
shown
in
Fig.
14(a
and
b),
respectively, while Table 4 documents the C2H6 adsorption
energies,

vibrations and interatomic distances of the CuC2H6 moiety.
In contrast, h3-adsorption was not realized, since optimization
of geometry resulted in formation of [Cu+(h2-C2H6)]Z
complex. The obtained values of adsorption energies for the
h1- and h2-structures were equal to 15.04 and 22.75 kcal/mol,
respectively. As follows from refs. [36,37,44], these values are
quite reasonable for the alkane-transition metal complexes.
One can also emphasize that formation of the h2-adsorption
complex leads to the very significant changes in geometry of the
adsorption site: the Cu+ ion partially leaves the cationic site,
while similar to adsorption of hydrogen, the coordination
number of Cu+ to the lattice oxygen atoms becomes equal to 2.
In contrast, formation of the h1-complex results only in a slight
increase of the CuO bond lengths (Table 1).
For the h2-structure, the computed adsorption energy is by
about 8 kcal/mol higher than for the h1 complex. Interaction of
two CH bonds with the Cu+ cation also leads to the much
stronger changes in geometry of the corresponding methyl
group and, therefore, results in the stronger low-frequency
shifts of the corresponding CH stretching vibrations. The
larger red shift corresponds to symmetric CH vibration, while
the lower shift to the asymmetric vibration of the CuC2H6
moiety. For both adsorption complexes the CH bonds involved
in the bonding with the Cu+ ions are considerably longer than
those calculated for the free C2H6. The rest of CH bonds of
adsorbed ethane are perturbed insignificantly.
Thus, the results of the theoretical modelling are in a
reasonably good agreement with the above-discussed experi-
mental data. Indeed, as follows from Table 5, the calculated C
H stretching frequencies for the [Cu+(h2-C2H6)]Z are close to
those in the experimentally observed DRIFT spectra. This
confirms that the dotted line in Fig. 13(b) really corresponds to
the individual spectrum of ethane in the complex with the h2-
geometry. The very weak band at 2734 cm1 could be then
ascribed to the h1-adsorption complexes with the lower
adsorption energy.
Despite both the experimental results and theoretical
calculations show that ethane adsorption by Cu(I)-ZSM-5
results in a very strong perturbation of two CH stretching
vibrations, the heating of the copper modified sample in the
ethane atmosphere at the temperatures up to 673 K did not
result in heterolytic dissociative adsorption. This is different
from ethane adsorption by ZnZSM-5. In principal, instead, the
interaction of C2H6 with the very strongly weakened CH
bonds with Cu+ could result either in the oxidative addition [36]
or in reduction of the exchanged copper cations. For Cu+ the
first of these possibilities is, however, very improbable, since
formation of the species containing trivalent copper is very
exotic. Instead copper is reduced by ethane into zero valence
state.
To clarify the nature of the unusually strong perturbation of
ethane by the isolated Cu+ ions at the a-sites, we also performed
the NBO analysis for the [Cu+(hn-C2H6)]Z (n = 1, 2)
adsorption complexes. The obtained orbital-populations and
energies of the donoracceptor interactions between C2H6 and

Cu+ are summarized in Table 5. As one can see from this
Table, for the h1-adsorption mode the overlap of the low-
occupied Cu+ s-orbital with CH s-orbital of ethane is very
strongly influenced by the steric factors. Therefore, the
ligand-to-metal donation is very weak (Edon = 4.5 kcal/mol).
Instead, the strongest interaction is the metal-to-ligand back
donation from the copper ds-and s-orbitals to the s*CH
orbital (Eback = 16.5 kcal) (Fig. 15(a)). On the other hand, for
[Cu+(h2-C2H6)]Z adsorption complexes both types of the
ligandmetal interactions are much stronger (Eback = 18.5 kcal/
mol and Edon = 32.5 kcal/mol). Therefore, the ethane bonding
with Cu+ could be reasonably well described in the similar way
as for the [Cu+(h2-H2)]Z complexes, i.e. by a synergetic
combination of the ligand-to-metal electron donation from CH
s-orbitals to the low-occupied Cu+ s-orbital combined with
metal-to-ligand back-donation from copper dp-orbitals to the
CH s*-orbitals (Fig. 15(b)). Obviously, both for h1- and h2-
C2H6 complexes each component of such interaction with
univalent copper results in a very strong weakening of the CH
bonds contacting the copper ion. However, only formation of
h2-adsorption complex results in an unusually strong red shift
of the CH stretching IR bands of adsorbed ethane, since both
the donation and the back-donation in this case are much more
effective.
Due to the very low stability, the complexes of transition
metals with the light alkanes have been earlier reported only for
very specific conditions such as matrix isolation, laser flash
photolysis or as intermediates in the reactions of oxidative
addition or reductive elimination. The present study shows that
the zeolite matrix can substantially promote formation of s-
ethane complexes with Cu+ ions. The search for the complexes
of paraffins with other low-valence transition metal ions
stabilized in zeolites is therefore very promising.
4. Conclusion
The summary of the above-discussed experimental data
indicates that independently on the preparation method Cu+
containing ZSM-5 zeolites exhibit a very similar adsorption
properties. Adsorption of H2 by a part of Cu+ ions in CuZSM-5
results in a very strong perturbation of adsorbed molecules,
which is evident from the very strong low-frequency shift of the
corresponding HH stretching frequencies. The Cu+ sites
strongly interacting with adsorbed hydrogen are the same as for
the strong N2 adsorption. In addition, at least two different Cu+
sites were discriminated by DRIFTS of adsorbed H2. It was also
shown that the number of Cu+ ions strongly adsorbing
molecular hydrogen is somewhat less than the number of sites
of the strong N2 adsorption. This could be explained by
different surrounding of Cu+ at the cation sites, which results in
different electronic properties of the exchanged cations. The
DFT modelling of H2 adsorption by Cu+ cations at a-site of
ZSM-5 zeolite allowed more convincing assignment of the
experimental IR data.
It was also shown that adsorption of ethane by ZSM-5
zeolite modified with Cu+ ions results in very strong
perturbation of adsorbed molecules, which leads to the very
large red-shift of CH stretching bands that has never been
observed before for ethane adsorbed on any cationic form of
zeolites or oxide. It was concluded that such unusual properties
of adsorbed C2H6 molecules resulted from formation of a rather
strong s-type adsorption complexes with the exchanged
univalent copper cations. These results could be considered
as the first direct DRIFTS observation of stable alkane
transition metal complexes.
