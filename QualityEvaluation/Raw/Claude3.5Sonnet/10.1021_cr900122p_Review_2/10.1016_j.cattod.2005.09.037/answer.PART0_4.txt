[1] "It was concluded that such unusual properties of adsorbed C2H6 molecules resulted from formation of a rather strong s-type adsorption complexes with the exchanged univalent copper cations."

[2] "The DFT modelling of H2 adsorption by Cu+ cations at a-site of ZSM-5 zeolite allowed more convincing assignment of the experimental IR data."

[3] "Adsorption of H2 by a part of Cu+ ions in CuZSM-5 results in a very strong perturbation of adsorbed molecules, which is evident from the very strong low-frequency shift of the corresponding HH stretching frequencies."

[4] "The copper modified ZSM-5 zeolits (CuZSM-5) are known to exhibit a high-catalytic activity in selective decomposition of NO into molecular oxygen and nitrogen"

The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts, particularly Cu-ZSM-5 zeolites, significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations. The study focuses on the adsorption properties of Cu+ ions in ZSM-5 zeolites for hydrogen, nitrogen, and ethane.

The formation of strong σ-type adsorption complexes between Cu+ ions and ethane molecules results in unusual properties of adsorbed C2H6. This interaction leads to a very large red-shift of CH stretching bands, which had not been observed before for ethane adsorbed on any cationic form of zeolites or oxide.

DFT modeling of H2 adsorption by Cu+ cations at the α-site of ZSM-5 zeolite provided a more convincing assignment of the experimental IR data. The adsorption of H2 by Cu+ ions in CuZSM-5 results in a very strong perturbation of adsorbed molecules, evidenced by the significant low-frequency shift of the corresponding H-H stretching frequencies.

The industrial significance of these catalysts is demonstrated by the high catalytic activity of Cu-ZSM-5 in the selective decomposition of NO into molecular oxygen and nitrogen. This property makes Cu-ZSM-5 valuable for environmental applications, such as reducing nitrogen oxide emissions.

The study reveals the importance of understanding the interaction between adsorbed molecules and metal cations in zeolites for developing more efficient catalysts for alkane transformations and other industrially relevant processes.

金属基催化剂的组成、结构和反应条件，特别是Cu-ZSM-5沸石，对烷烃转化的机理和效率有显著影响。该研究主要关注Cu-ZSM-5沸石中Cu+离子对氢气、氮气和乙烷的吸附特性。

Cu+离子与乙烷分子之间形成强σ型吸附复合物，导致吸附的C2H6分子表现出异常特性。这种相互作用导致CH伸缩振动带发生很大的红移，这在之前的任何阳离子型沸石或氧化物吸附乙烷的研究中都未曾观察到。

对ZSM-5沸石α位点上Cu+阳离子吸附H2的DFT建模为实验IR数据提供了更有说服力的解释。Cu-ZSM-5中Cu+离子对H2的吸附导致吸附分子发生很强的扰动，这从相应H-H伸缩振动频率的显著低频移动可以得到证实。

这些催化剂的工业重要性体现在Cu-ZSM-5对NO选择性分解为分子氧和氮气的高催化活性。这一特性使Cu-ZSM-5在环境应用中具有重要价值，例如降低氮氧化物排放。

该研究揭示了理解吸附分子与沸石中金属阳离子相互作用的重要性，这对开发更高效的烷烃转化催化剂和其他工业相关过程具有重要意义。
