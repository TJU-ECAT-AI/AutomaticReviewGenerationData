[1] "ZSM-5 zeolites modified with Cu+ ions were prepared either by the high-temperature chemical reaction of hydrogen form with CuCl vapour or by the wet ion exchange with subsequent reduction of the modified samples in CO at 873 K."

[2] "Adsorption of H2, N2 or C2H6 by Cu+ ions was studied by DRIFTS and by volumetric technique. The conclusions about the structure of adsorption complexes were supported by the DFT cluster quantum chemical calculations."

[3] "The obtained results indicated that in addition to the previously reported strong adsorption of nitrogen, the univalent copper also unusually strongly adsorbs molecular hydrogen and ethane."

[4] "The DFT cluster modelling indicated that both adsorption of hydrogen and ethane could be explained by interaction with the isolated Cu+ ions localized at the a sites of the ZSM-5 framework."

[5] "Quantum chemical calculations indicated the important role in the bonding of adsorbed hydrogen and ethane of electron back donation from dp-orbitals of Cu+ ions to the s*HH or CH orbitals."

The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-exchanged zeolites, specifically Cu-ZSM-5, significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations. The study focused on Cu+ ions in ZSM-5 zeolites, which were prepared by two methods: high-temperature reaction with CuCl vapor or wet ion exchange followed by CO reduction.

The structure of Cu-ZSM-5, particularly the location of Cu+ ions at the a sites of the ZSM-5 framework, plays a crucial role in its adsorption properties. This structural arrangement allows for strong adsorption of not only nitrogen but also molecular hydrogen and ethane, which is unusual for zeolites.

The reaction conditions, such as the temperature of preparation and reduction, affect the formation and stability of Cu+ ions in the zeolite framework. These conditions determine the availability and activity of the Cu+ sites for adsorption and potential catalytic reactions.

The efficiency of alkane transformations is influenced by the electronic properties of Cu+ ions. Quantum chemical calculations revealed that electron back donation from the dp-orbitals of Cu+ ions to the s*HH or CH orbitals of the adsorbed molecules is crucial for the strong bonding observed.

While the study does not directly address industrial significance, the unusual adsorption properties of Cu-ZSM-5 for small molecules like H2 and C2H6 suggest potential applications in gas separation, storage, or catalytic processes involving these molecules. The strong interaction between Cu+ and alkanes could be particularly relevant for processes requiring activation of C-H bonds.

The combination of experimental techniques (DRIFTS and volumetric measurements) with theoretical modeling (DFT calculations) provides a comprehensive understanding of the adsorption mechanisms, which is essential for optimizing these materials for industrial applications.

金属交换沸石(特别是Cu-ZSM-5)的组成、结构和反应条件显著影响烷烃转化的机理和效率。该研究主要关注ZSM-5沸石中的Cu+离子,这些离子通过两种方法制备:与CuCl蒸气的高温反应或湿法离子交换后在CO中还原。

Cu-ZSM-5的结构,尤其是Cu+离子在ZSM-5骨架a位点的位置,对其吸附性质起着至关重要的作用。这种结构安排不仅允许强吸附氮气,还能异常强烈地吸附分子氢和乙烷,这对沸石来说是不寻常的。

制备和还原的温度等反应条件影响沸石骨架中Cu+离子的形成和稳定性。这些条件决定了Cu+位点对吸附和潜在催化反应的可用性和活性。

烷烃转化的效率受Cu+离子电子性质的影响。量子化学计算揭示,Cu+离子的dp轨道向吸附分子的s*HH或CH轨道的电子反馈对观察到的强键合至关重要。

虽然该研究没有直接讨论工业意义,但Cu-ZSM-5对H2和C2H6等小分子的异常吸附性质表明其在气体分离、储存或涉及这些分子的催化过程中有潜在应用。Cu+与烷烃之间的强相互作用可能特别适用于需要活化C-H键的过程。

实验技术(DRIFTS和体积测量)与理论模拟(DFT计算)的结合提供了对吸附机理的全面理解,这对优化这些材料的工业应用至关重要。
