[1] "ZSM-5 zeolites modified with Cu+ ions were prepared either by the high-temperature chemical reaction of hydrogen form with CuCl vapour or by the wet ion exchange with subsequent reduction of the modified samples in CO at 873 K."

[2] "Adsorption of H2, N2 or C2H6 by Cu+ ions was studied by DRIFTS and by volumetric technique. The conclusions about the structure of adsorption complexes were supported by the DFT cluster quantum chemical calculations."

[3] "The obtained results indicated that in addition to the previously reported strong adsorption of nitrogen, the univalent copper also unusually strongly adsorbs molecular hydrogen and ethane."

[4] "The DFT cluster modelling indicated that both adsorption of hydrogen and ethane could be explained by interaction with the isolated Cu+ ions localized at the a sites of the ZSM-5 framework."

[5] "Quantum chemical calculations indicated the important role in the bonding of adsorbed hydrogen and ethane of electron back donation from dp-orbitals of Cu+ ions to the s*HH or CH orbitals."

The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-exchanged zeolites, specifically Cu-ZSM-5, significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations. The study focuses on Cu+ ions exchanged into ZSM-5 zeolites, which were prepared by either high-temperature reaction with CuCl vapor or wet ion exchange followed by CO reduction.

The structure of the catalyst, particularly the location of Cu+ ions at the a sites of the ZSM-5 framework, plays a crucial role in the adsorption of molecules like H2, N2, and C2H6. The isolated nature of these Cu+ ions contributes to their unusual adsorption properties.

The reaction conditions, such as the temperature of preparation and reduction, affect the formation and stability of Cu+ ions in the zeolite. The study shows that Cu+ ions formed by these methods exhibit exceptionally strong adsorption of hydrogen and ethane, in addition to the previously known strong nitrogen adsorption.

The efficiency of alkane transformations is influenced by the electronic properties of the Cu+ ions. Quantum chemical calculations revealed that electron back donation from the dp-orbitals of Cu+ ions to the antibonding orbitals of the adsorbed molecules (s*HH or CH) plays a significant role in the bonding mechanism. This interaction leads to very strong perturbation of the adsorbed molecules, evidenced by large red shifts in their vibrational frequencies.

While the study doesn't directly address industrial significance, the unusual adsorption properties and the ability to form stable complexes with light alkanes suggest potential applications in catalytic processes involving these molecules. The detailed understanding of the adsorption mechanisms and the factors influencing them could contribute to the design of more efficient catalysts for alkane transformations in industrial processes.

金属交换沸石(特别是Cu-ZSM-5)的组成、结构和反应条件显著影响烷烃转化的机理和效率。该研究主要关注交换到ZSM-5沸石中的Cu+离子,这些离子可以通过与CuCl蒸气的高温反应或湿法离子交换后在CO中还原来制备。

催化剂的结构,特别是Cu+离子在ZSM-5骨架a位点的位置,在H2、N2和C2H6等分子的吸附中起着关键作用。这些Cu+离子的孤立性质导致了它们不寻常的吸附特性。

制备和还原的温度等反应条件影响沸石中Cu+离子的形成和稳定性。研究表明,通过这些方法形成的Cu+离子除了已知的强氮气吸附外,还表现出对氢气和乙烷的异常强吸附。

烷烃转化的效率受Cu+离子电子性质的影响。量子化学计算揭示,Cu+离子的dp轨道到吸附分子反键轨道(s*HH或CH)的电子反馈在键合机制中起重要作用。这种相互作用导致吸附分子的强烈扰动,表现为其振动频率的大幅红移。

虽然该研究没有直接涉及工业意义,但不寻常的吸附性质和形成轻烷稳定络合物的能力表明其在涉及这些分子的催化过程中有潜在应用。对吸附机理及影响因素的深入理解可能有助于设计更高效的工业烷烃转化催化剂。
