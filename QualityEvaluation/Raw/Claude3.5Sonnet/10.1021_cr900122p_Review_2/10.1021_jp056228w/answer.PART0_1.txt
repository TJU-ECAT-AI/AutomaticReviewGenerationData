[1] "We have carried out a hybrid density functional study of mechanisms for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane on the (010) surface of V2O5. The surface was modeled using both vanadium oxide clusters and a periodic slab."

[2] "The potential energy surface is found to have large barriers, which are lowered somewhat when the possibility of a triplet state is considered."

[3] "The barriers on the reaction pathway are 4580 kcal/mol above the energy of the reactants, which are much larger than found experimentally for propane ODH on supported vanadia."

[4] "Our results point toward a possible reason as to why the interaction of vanadium oxide with a support may lower the barrier for the initial dissociative adsorption of propane and propene elimination steps in the ODH reaction pathways investigated here"

The study examines oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of propane on vanadium oxide catalysts. Key findings include:

1. The (010) surface of V2O5 was modeled using clusters and periodic slabs.

2. The potential energy surface has large barriers, which are somewhat lowered in the triplet state.

3. Calculated barriers (45-80 kcal/mol) are much higher than experimental values for supported vanadia catalysts.

4. Interaction with a support may lower reaction barriers, explaining the improved performance of supported catalysts.

5. The study suggests that pure V2O5 surfaces are not efficient catalysts for propane ODH, and support interactions are crucial for catalytic activity.

6. Factors like concerted reactions with O2 or oxygen removal from different sites may further lower barriers.

7. The work highlights the importance of considering electronic states (singlet vs triplet) and support effects in understanding catalytic mechanisms.

Overall, the study provides insights into how catalyst composition, structure, and support interactions influence alkane transformation mechanisms, particularly for oxidative dehydrogenation reactions. It demonstrates the industrial significance of supported vanadium oxide catalysts by explaining their improved performance compared to bulk V2O5.

该研究考察了钒氧化物催化剂上丙烷的氧化脱氢（ODH）反应。主要发现包括：

1. 使用簇模型和周期性平板模型对V2O5的(010)表面进行了建模。

2. 势能面存在较大的能垒，在三重态下这些能垒略有降低。

3. 计算得出的能垒（45-80 kcal/mol）远高于负载型钒氧化物催化剂的实验值。

4. 与载体的相互作用可能会降低反应能垒，这解释了负载型催化剂性能的提高。

5. 研究表明，纯V2O5表面对丙烷ODH反应的催化效率不高，与载体的相互作用对催化活性至关重要。

6. 诸如与O2的协同反应或从不同位点移除氧等因素可能会进一步降低能垒。

7. 该工作强调了考虑电子态（单重态与三重态）和载体效应对理解催化机理的重要性。

总的来说，该研究深入探讨了催化剂组成、结构和载体相互作用如何影响烷烃转化机理，特别是氧化脱氢反应。通过解释负载型钒氧化物催化剂相比于块体V2O5性能的提升，证明了它们在工业上的重要性。
