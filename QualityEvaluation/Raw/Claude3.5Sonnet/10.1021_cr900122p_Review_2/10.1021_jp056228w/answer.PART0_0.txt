[1] "Experimental studies of catalyst structure (25) generally agree that when the concentration of vanadium oxide species is low, isolated VO4 units form on the support surface."

[2] "The dependence of the reactivity on coverage of the support surface by vanadium oxide is unclear in the literature."

[3] "Experimental studies of the ODH reaction with supported vanadia catalysts have generally supported the reaction mechanism originally proposed by Mars and van Krevelen."

[4] "The experimental barriers for propane ODH on supported vanadium oxide are in the range 2030 kcal/mol, (4,10,22) which are much lower than the value of about 80 kcal/mol found in this study for the water elimination step."

[5] "Our results point toward a possible reason as to why the interaction of vanadium oxide with a support may lower the barrier for the initial dissociative adsorption of propane and propene elimination steps in the ODH reaction pathways investigated here"

The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts, particularly supported vanadium oxides, significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations like oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH). 

For supported vanadium oxide catalysts, the concentration of vanadium oxide species affects the catalyst structure. At low concentrations, isolated VO4 units form on the support surface. However, the relationship between reactivity and surface coverage is not fully understood.

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism is generally accepted for ODH reactions on supported vanadia catalysts. This mechanism involves a series of steps including oxygen insertion, water elimination, and oxygen vacancy filling.

Experimental studies show that supported vanadium oxide catalysts have much lower activation barriers (20-30 kcal/mol) for propane ODH compared to theoretical calculations on clean V2O5 surfaces (about 80 kcal/mol). This suggests that the support plays a crucial role in lowering reaction barriers.

The interaction between vanadium oxide and the support material may lower barriers for initial propane adsorption and propene elimination steps. This could be due to stabilization of certain electronic states of the vanadium oxide clusters when anchored to a support.

These factors contribute to the industrial significance of supported vanadium oxide catalysts for alkane transformations. The ability of the support to modify catalyst reactivity allows for tuning of catalytic properties, potentially leading to more efficient and selective processes for valuable chemical transformations.

金属基催化剂的组成、结构和反应条件，特别是负载型钒氧化物，显著影响烷烃转化的机理和效率，如氧化脱氢（ODH）反应。

对于负载型钒氧化物催化剂，钒氧化物物种的浓度影响催化剂结构。在低浓度时，孤立的VO4单元在载体表面形成。然而，反应活性与表面覆盖率之间的关系尚未完全了解。

Mars-van Krevelen机理通常被认为适用于负载型钒氧化物催化剂的ODH反应。这种机理涉及一系列步骤，包括氧插入、水消除和氧空位填充。

实验研究表明，负载型钒氧化物催化剂的丙烷ODH活化能垒（20-30 kcal/mol）远低于纯V2O5表面的理论计算值（约80 kcal/mol）。这表明载体在降低反应能垒方面起着关键作用。

钒氧化物与载体材料之间的相互作用可能会降低丙烷初始吸附和丙烯消除步骤的能垒。这可能是由于钒氧化物簇锚定在载体上时某些电子态的稳定化。

这些因素共同促进了负载型钒氧化物催化剂在烷烃转化中的工业重要性。载体修饰催化剂反应活性的能力允许调节催化性能，潜在地导致更高效和选择性的有价值化学转化过程。
