[1] "Experimental studies of catalyst structure (25) generally agree that when the concentration of vanadium oxide species is low, isolated VO4 units form on the support surface. These units are assumed to contain a vertical VO double bond and three bridging VOS linkages, where S represents the support metal cation (S = Al, Si, Ti, etc.)."

[2] "Experimental studies of the ODH reaction with supported vanadia catalysts have generally supported the reaction mechanism originally proposed by Mars and van Krevelen."

[3] "The experimental barriers for propane ODH on supported vanadium oxide are in the range 2030 kcal/mol, (4,10,22) which are much lower than the value of about 80 kcal/mol found in this study for the water elimination step."

[4] "Our results point toward a possible reason as to why the interaction of vanadium oxide with a support may lower the barrier for the initial dissociative adsorption of propane and propene elimination steps in the ODH reaction pathways investigated here, although at this point it remains somewhat speculative."

The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of supported vanadium oxide catalysts significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations, particularly in oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) processes:

1. Composition: At low concentrations, vanadium oxide forms isolated VO4 units on the support surface. These units contain a vertical VO double bond and three bridging VOS linkages, where S represents the support metal cation (e.g., Al, Si, Ti).

2. Structure: The interaction between vanadium oxide and the support material plays a crucial role in determining catalytic activity. The support can stabilize certain electronic states of the vanadium oxide, potentially lowering reaction barriers.

3. Reaction mechanism: Supported vanadia catalysts generally follow the Mars-van Krevelen mechanism for ODH reactions.

4. Efficiency: Experimental barriers for propane ODH on supported vanadium oxide are much lower (20-30 kcal/mol) compared to theoretical calculations on clean V2O5 surfaces (~80 kcal/mol). This suggests that the support significantly enhances catalytic activity.

5. Industrial significance: The lower activation barriers and enhanced catalytic activity of supported vanadium oxide catalysts contribute to their industrial importance in alkane transformation processes.

The study highlights the complex interplay between the vanadium oxide species and the support material, emphasizing the need for further research to fully understand the mechanisms behind the enhanced catalytic activity of supported vanadium oxide catalysts in alkane transformations.

负载型钒氧化物催化剂的组成、结构和反应条件显著影响烷烃转化的机理和效率，特别是在氧化脱氢(ODH)过程中：

1. 组成：在低浓度下，钒氧化物在载体表面形成孤立的VO4单元。这些单元包含一个垂直的VO双键和三个桥接的VOS键，其中S代表载体金属阳离子（如Al、Si、Ti）。

2. 结构：钒氧化物与载体材料之间的相互作用在决定催化活性方面起着关键作用。载体可以稳定钒氧化物的某些电子态，可能降低反应能垒。

3. 反应机理：负载型钒氧化物催化剂通常遵循Mars-van Krevelen机理进行ODH反应。

4. 效率：负载型钒氧化物上丙烷ODH的实验能垒要低得多（20-30 kcal/mol），相比于在纯V2O5表面上的理论计算值（~80 kcal/mol）。这表明载体显著提高了催化活性。

5. 工业意义：较低的活化能垒和增强的催化活性使负载型钒氧化物催化剂在烷烃转化过程中具有重要的工业意义。

该研究强调了钒氧化物物种与载体材料之间的复杂相互作用，突出了进一步研究的必要性，以充分理解负载型钒氧化物催化剂在烷烃转化中增强催化活性的机理。
