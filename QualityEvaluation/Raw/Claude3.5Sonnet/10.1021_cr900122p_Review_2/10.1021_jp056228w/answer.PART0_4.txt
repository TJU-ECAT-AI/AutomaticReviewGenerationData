[1] "The oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of propane over a supported vanadia catalyst is of great interest because of its importance in industrial catalysis."

[2] "Experimental studies of catalyst structure (25) generally agree that when the concentration of vanadium oxide species is low, isolated VO4 units form on the support surface."

[3] "Experimental studies of the ODH reaction with supported vanadia catalysts have generally supported the reaction mechanism originally proposed by Mars and van Krevelen."

[4] "The experimental barriers for propane ODH on supported vanadium oxide are in the range 2030 kcal/mol, (4,10,22) which are much lower than the value of about 80 kcal/mol found in this study for the water elimination step."

[5] "Our results point toward a possible reason as to why the interaction of vanadium oxide with a support may lower the barrier for the initial dissociative adsorption of propane and propene elimination steps in the ODH reaction pathways investigated here"

The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of supported vanadium oxide catalysts significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations, particularly in oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) processes. 

The concentration of vanadium oxide species affects the catalyst structure, with low concentrations forming isolated VO4 units on the support surface. This structural variation likely impacts the reaction mechanism and efficiency.

The support material plays a crucial role in enhancing catalytic activity. The interaction between vanadium oxide and the support appears to lower reaction barriers, particularly for the initial dissociative adsorption of propane and propene elimination steps. This effect contributes to the much lower experimental barriers (20-30 kcal/mol) observed for propane ODH on supported vanadium oxide compared to theoretical calculations on unsupported V2O5 surfaces (about 80 kcal/mol).

The reaction mechanism for supported vanadia catalysts generally follows the Mars-van Krevelen mechanism, which involves a redox cycle of the catalyst. This mechanism is important for understanding the catalytic process and potentially optimizing industrial applications.

The industrial significance of supported vanadium oxide catalysts for ODH of propane stems from their ability to efficiently catalyze the reaction under milder conditions than unsupported catalysts. This efficiency likely translates to reduced energy requirements and potentially improved selectivity in industrial processes.

While the document does not specifically address metal-exchanged zeolites, the principles of support-catalyst interactions and their effects on reaction mechanisms and efficiency likely apply to other supported metal catalysts as well.

金属基催化剂的组成、结构和反应条件，特别是负载型钒氧化物催化剂，对烷烃转化的机理和效率有显著影响，尤其是在氧化脱氢(ODH)过程中。

钒氧化物物种的浓度影响催化剂结构，低浓度时在支撑表面形成孤立的VO4单元。这种结构变化可能影响反应机理和效率。

支撑材料在增强催化活性方面起着关键作用。钒氧化物与支撑材料之间的相互作用似乎降低了反应障碍，特别是对于丙烷的初始解离吸附和丙烯消除步骤。这种效应导致负载型钒氧化物上丙烷ODH的实验障碍（20-30 kcal/mol）远低于非负载V2O5表面的理论计算值（约80 kcal/mol）。

负载型钒催化剂的反应机理通常遵循Mars-van Krevelen机理，涉及催化剂的氧化还原循环。这一机理对于理解催化过程和潜在优化工业应用很重要。

负载型钒氧化物催化剂在丙烷ODH中的工业重要性源于它们能够在比非负载催化剂更温和的条件下高效催化反应。这种效率可能转化为工业过程中能源需求的减少和选择性的潜在改善。

虽然文献没有具体提到金属交换沸石，但支撑-催化剂相互作用及其对反应机理和效率的影响原理可能也适用于其他负载金属催化剂。
