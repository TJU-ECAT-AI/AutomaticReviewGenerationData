[1] "The oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of propane over a supported vanadia catalyst is of great interest because of its importance in industrial catalysis."

[2] "Experimental studies of catalyst structure (25) generally agree that when the concentration of vanadium oxide species is low, isolated VO4 units form on the support surface."

[3] "The dependence of the reactivity on coverage of the support surface by vanadium oxide is unclear in the literature."

[4] "Experimental studies of the ODH reaction with supported vanadia catalysts have generally supported the reaction mechanism originally proposed by Mars and van Krevelen."

[5] "The experimental barriers for propane ODH on supported vanadium oxide are in the range 2030 kcal/mol, (4,10,22) which are much lower than the value of about 80 kcal/mol found in this study for the water elimination step."

[6] "Our results point toward a possible reason as to why the interaction of vanadium oxide with a support may lower the barrier for the initial dissociative adsorption of propane and propene elimination steps in the ODH reaction pathways investigated here"

The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts, particularly supported vanadium oxides, significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations like oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of propane. 

The concentration of vanadium oxide species on the support surface affects the catalyst structure, with low concentrations forming isolated VO4 units. However, the relationship between reactivity and surface coverage is not fully understood.

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism is generally supported for ODH reactions with supported vanadia catalysts. Experimental barriers for propane ODH on supported vanadium oxide (20-30 kcal/mol) are much lower than those calculated for unsupported V2O5 surfaces (around 80 kcal/mol), suggesting that the support plays a crucial role in lowering reaction barriers.

The interaction between vanadium oxide and the support material may lower barriers for initial propane adsorption and propene elimination steps, contributing to the increased efficiency of supported catalysts. This interaction likely stabilizes intermediate states along the reaction pathway.

These factors contribute to the industrial significance of supported vanadium oxide catalysts for propane ODH, as the lower energy barriers and increased efficiency make the process more economically viable. The ability to tune catalyst performance through composition and structure offers opportunities for optimizing industrial processes.

While the literature provided does not specifically address metal-exchanged zeolites, the principles of how support materials influence catalyst performance may be applicable to zeolite-based systems as well.

金属基催化剂的组成、结构和反应条件，特别是负载型钒氧化物，显著影响烷烃转化反应（如丙烷氧化脱氢（ODH））的机理和效率。

钒氧化物物种在载体表面的浓度影响催化剂结构，低浓度时形成孤立的VO4单元。然而，反应性与表面覆盖率之间的关系尚未完全理解。

Mars-van Krevelen机理普遍支持负载型钒催化剂的ODH反应。负载型钒氧化物上丙烷ODH的实验能垒（20-30 kcal/mol）远低于非负载V2O5表面的计算值（约80 kcal/mol），表明载体在降低反应能垒方面起着关键作用。

钒氧化物与载体材料的相互作用可能降低了初始丙烷吸附和丙烯脱除步骤的能垒，从而提高了负载型催化剂的效率。这种相互作用可能稳定了反应路径上的中间态。

这些因素促进了负载型钒氧化物催化剂在丙烷ODH工业应用中的重要性，因为较低的能垒和较高的效率使得该过程在经济上更加可行。通过组成和结构调整催化剂性能的能力为优化工业过程提供了机会。

虽然所提供的文献没有特别提到金属交换沸石，但支撑材料如何影响催化剂性能的原理可能也适用于基于沸石的体系。
