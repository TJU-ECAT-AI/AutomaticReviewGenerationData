[1] "Recently we reported that silica supported zirconium hydride species was capable of room temperature activation of carbon-hydrogen bonds [1,2] and of the low temperature hydrogenolysis of alkanes to methane and ethane [2-4]."

[2] "The exceptional properties of this catalyst in the field of C-H and C-C bond activation are ascribed to the very electrophilic (formally 8 electron) and sterically unhindered (four coordinate) nature of the zirconium hydride complex."

[3] "The catalytic deuteration of propane by deuterium at room temperature catalysed by (=- SiO)3ZrH showed that the primary C-H bonds of propane reacted seven times faster than the secondary C-H bonds."

The literature does not directly address vanadium oxides, metal-exchanged zeolites, or oxidative dehydrogenation. However, it does discuss a silica-supported zirconium hydride catalyst that is relevant to alkane transformations:

This catalyst ((=SiO)3ZrH) is capable of activating C-H bonds at room temperature and performing low-temperature hydrogenolysis of alkanes to methane and ethane. Its exceptional properties in C-H and C-C bond activation are attributed to its highly electrophilic nature (formally 8-electron) and lack of steric hindrance (four-coordinate structure).

The catalyst shows selectivity in C-H bond activation, with primary C-H bonds of propane reacting seven times faster than secondary C-H bonds during catalytic deuteration at room temperature. 

While this doesn't directly answer the question about vanadium oxides or zeolites, it demonstrates how the composition and structure of a supported metal catalyst can influence its reactivity and selectivity in alkane transformations. The ability to activate C-H bonds at low temperatures and the selectivity for primary over secondary C-H bonds could be industrially significant for alkane conversion processes.

这篇文献并未直接讨论钒氧化物、金属交换沸石或氧化脱氢反应。但是,它确实讨论了一种与烷烃转化相关的二氧化硅负载的锆氢化物催化剂:

这种催化剂((=SiO)3ZrH)能够在室温下活化C-H键,并在低温下进行烷烃的氢解反应生成甲烷和乙烷。它在C-H和C-C键活化方面的卓越性能归因于其高度亲电性(形式上为8电子)和缺乏位阻(四配位结构)。

该催化剂在C-H键活化中表现出选择性,在室温催化氘代过程中,丙烷的伯C-H键的反应速率是仲C-H键的7倍。

虽然这并没有直接回答关于钒氧化物或沸石的问题,但它展示了负载金属催化剂的组成和结构如何影响其在烷烃转化中的反应活性和选择性。在低温下活化C-H键的能力以及对伯C-H键而非仲C-H键的选择性,对烷烃转化过程的工业应用可能具有重要意义。
