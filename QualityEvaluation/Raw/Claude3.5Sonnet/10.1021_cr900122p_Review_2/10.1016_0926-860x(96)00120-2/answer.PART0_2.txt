[1] "Recently we reported that silica supported zirconium hydride species was capable of room temperature activation of carbon-hydrogen bonds [1,2] and of the low temperature hydrogenolysis of alkanes to methane and ethane [2-4]."

[2] "The exceptional properties of this catalyst in the field of C-H and C-C bond activation are ascribed to the very electrophilic (formally 8 electron) and sterically unhindered (four coordinate) nature of the zirconium hydride complex."

[3] "The stoichiometric reaction of (= SiO)3Zr-H and propane was followed by infrared spectroscopy in situ."

[4] "We were able to study the selectivity of the activation of propane carbon-hydrogen bonds of propane in a catalytic reaction as well, the deuteration of propane."

The literature does not directly address the question about vanadium oxides and metal-exchanged zeolites for alkane transformations. However, it does discuss a related metal-based catalyst system - silica-supported zirconium hydride - for alkane activation and transformation. 

The composition and structure of this catalyst involve zirconium hydride species supported on silica, with the formula (≡SiO)3Zr-H. Its structure is described as very electrophilic (8-electron) and sterically unhindered (four-coordinate).

Reaction conditions discussed include room temperature for C-H bond activation and low temperature for hydrogenolysis of alkanes to methane and ethane. The catalyst is capable of both stoichiometric and catalytic reactions with propane.

The mechanisms explored include C-H bond activation through σ-bond metathesis and catalytic deuteration of propane. The efficiency is demonstrated by the catalyst's ability to activate C-H bonds at room temperature and catalyze deuteration with a half-life of approximately 3 minutes.

While this system is different from the specific catalysts mentioned in the question, it illustrates how the composition, structure, and reaction conditions of a metal-based catalyst can influence its mechanisms and efficiency in alkane transformations. The ability to activate C-H bonds at low temperatures could be significant for industrial applications, though the industrial significance is not directly addressed in the given text.

该文献并未直接讨论钒氧化物和金属交换沸石在烷烃转化中的应用。然而，它确实讨论了一个相关的金属基催化剂系统 - 硅胶负载的锆氢化物 - 用于烷烃活化和转化。

这种催化剂的组成和结构涉及硅胶负载的锆氢化物物种，其分子式为(≡SiO)3Zr-H。其结构被描述为具有很强的亲电性（8电子）和立体位阻小（四配位）的特点。

讨论的反应条件包括在室温下进行C-H键活化，以及在低温下将烷烃加氢裂解成甲烷和乙烷。该催化剂能够与丙烷进行化学计量反应和催化反应。

探讨的机理包括通过σ键复分解进行C-H键活化和丙烷的催化氘代。其效率通过催化剂在室温下活化C-H键的能力以及催化氘代反应半衰期约为3分钟得到证明。

虽然这个系统与问题中提到的特定催化剂不同，但它说明了金属基催化剂的组成、结构和反应条件如何影响其在烷烃转化中的机理和效率。在低温下活化C-H键的能力对工业应用可能具有重要意义，尽管给定的文本并未直接讨论其工业意义。
