[1] "Recently we reported that silica supported zirconium hydride species was capable of room temperature activation of carbon-hydrogen bonds [1,2] and of the low temperature hydrogenolysis of alkanes to methane and ethane [2-4]."

[2] "The exceptional properties of this catalyst in the field of C-H and C-C bond activation are ascribed to the very electrophilic (formally 8 electron) and sterically unhindered (four coordinate) nature of the zirconium hydride complex."

[3] "We were able to study the selectivity of the activation of propane carbon-hydrogen bonds of propane in a catalytic reaction as well, the deuteration of propane."

[4] "The catalytic deuteration of propane by deuterium at room temperature catalysed by (= SiO)3ZrH showed that the primary C-H bonds of propane reacted seven times faster than the secondary C-H bonds."

The literature does not directly address oxidative dehydrogenation or zeolite-catalyzed reactions. However, it does discuss a silica-supported zirconium hydride catalyst that is capable of activating C-H bonds in alkanes at room temperature. The catalyst's effectiveness is attributed to its electrophilic nature and lack of steric hindrance. 

The study focuses on the activation of propane C-H bonds, demonstrating selectivity between primary and secondary C-H bonds. In the catalytic deuteration of propane, primary C-H bonds reacted seven times faster than secondary C-H bonds. This selectivity provides insights into the mechanism of alkane activation by this particular catalyst.

While the literature does not discuss industrial significance directly, the ability to activate C-H bonds at room temperature and the selectivity observed could potentially be relevant for industrial processes involving alkane transformations. However, more research would be needed to determine the industrial applicability of this specific catalyst system.

该文献并未直接讨论氧化脱氢或沸石催化反应。但是，它确实讨论了一种能够在室温下活化烷烃C-H键的二氧化硅负载的锆氢化物催化剂。该催化剂的有效性归因于其亲电性和缺乏空间位阻。

研究重点关注丙烷C-H键的活化，展示了一级和二级C-H键之间的选择性。在丙烷的催化氘代反应中，一级C-H键的反应速度是二级C-H键的七倍。这种选择性为该特定催化剂的烷烃活化机理提供了见解。

虽然文献没有直接讨论工业意义，但在室温下活化C-H键的能力以及观察到的选择性可能与涉及烷烃转化的工业过程有关。然而，需要进行更多研究来确定这种特定催化剂系统的工业适用性。
