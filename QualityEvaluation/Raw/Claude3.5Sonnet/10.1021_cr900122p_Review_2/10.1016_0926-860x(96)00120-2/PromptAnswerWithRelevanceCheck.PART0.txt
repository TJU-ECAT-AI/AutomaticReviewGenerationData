[1] "The stoichiometric reaction between propane and (=- SiO)3ZrH leads to the formation of a mixture of (=- SiO)3ZrCH(CH3)2 and (-= SiO)3ZrCH2CH2CH3."

[2] "The catalytic deuteration of propane by deuterium at room temperature catalysed by (=- SiO)3ZrH showed that the primary C-H bonds of propane reacted seven times faster than the secondary C-H bonds."

[3] "The exceptional properties of this catalyst in the field of C-H and C-C bond activation are ascribed to the very electrophilic (formally 8 electron) and sterically unhindered (four coordinate) nature of the zirconium hydride complex."

This document does not directly address supported vanadium oxides, metal-exchanged zeolites, or oxidative dehydrogenation processes. However, it does provide some insights into alkane transformations using a supported zirconium hydride catalyst:

The study focuses on a silica-supported zirconium hydride catalyst (=- SiO)3ZrH for propane activation. This catalyst shows selectivity in C-H bond activation, with primary C-H bonds reacting faster than secondary C-H bonds. The catalyst's effectiveness is attributed to its electrophilic nature and lack of steric hindrance.

While this doesn't directly answer the question about industrial significance, it demonstrates how catalyst composition and structure (in this case, a supported zirconium hydride) can influence reaction mechanisms and efficiency in alkane transformations. The study provides an example of how detailed understanding of catalyst properties and reaction selectivity can contribute to developing more efficient catalytic processes for alkane transformations.

这篇文档没有直接涉及负载型钒氧化物、金属交换的沸石或氧化脱氢过程。然而，它确实提供了一些关于使用负载型锆氢化物催化剂进行烷烃转化的见解：

该研究关注硅胶负载的锆氢化物催化剂(=- SiO)3ZrH用于丙烷活化。这种催化剂在C-H键活化中表现出选择性，伯C-H键的反应速度快于仲C-H键。催化剂的有效性归因于其亲电性和缺乏立体位阻。

虽然这并没有直接回答关于工业重要性的问题，但它展示了催化剂的组成和结构（在这种情况下是负载型锆氢化物）如何影响烷烃转化的反应机理和效率。该研究提供了一个例子，说明对催化剂性质和反应选择性的详细理解如何有助于开发更高效的烷烃转化催化过程。

The literature does not directly address oxidative dehydrogenation or zeolite-catalyzed reactions. However, it does discuss a silica-supported zirconium hydride catalyst that is capable of activating C-H bonds in alkanes at room temperature. The catalyst's effectiveness is attributed to its electrophilic nature and lack of steric hindrance. 

The study focuses on the activation of propane C-H bonds, demonstrating selectivity between primary and secondary C-H bonds. In the catalytic deuteration of propane, primary C-H bonds reacted seven times faster than secondary C-H bonds. This selectivity provides insights into the mechanism of alkane activation by this particular catalyst.

While the literature does not discuss industrial significance directly, the ability to activate C-H bonds at room temperature and the selectivity observed could potentially be relevant for industrial processes involving alkane transformations. However, more research would be needed to determine the industrial applicability of this specific catalyst system.

该文献并未直接讨论氧化脱氢或沸石催化反应。但是，它确实讨论了一种能够在室温下活化烷烃C-H键的二氧化硅负载的锆氢化物催化剂。该催化剂的有效性归因于其亲电性和缺乏空间位阻。

研究重点关注丙烷C-H键的活化，展示了一级和二级C-H键之间的选择性。在丙烷的催化氘代反应中，一级C-H键的反应速度是二级C-H键的七倍。这种选择性为该特定催化剂的烷烃活化机理提供了见解。

虽然文献没有直接讨论工业意义，但在室温下活化C-H键的能力以及观察到的选择性可能与涉及烷烃转化的工业过程有关。然而，需要进行更多研究来确定这种特定催化剂系统的工业适用性。

The literature does not directly address the question about vanadium oxides and metal-exchanged zeolites for alkane transformations. However, it does discuss a related metal-based catalyst system - silica-supported zirconium hydride - for alkane activation and transformation. 

The composition and structure of this catalyst involve zirconium hydride species supported on silica, with the formula (≡SiO)3Zr-H. Its structure is described as very electrophilic (8-electron) and sterically unhindered (four-coordinate).

Reaction conditions discussed include room temperature for C-H bond activation and low temperature for hydrogenolysis of alkanes to methane and ethane. The catalyst is capable of both stoichiometric and catalytic reactions with propane.

The mechanisms explored include C-H bond activation through σ-bond metathesis and catalytic deuteration of propane. The efficiency is demonstrated by the catalyst's ability to activate C-H bonds at room temperature and catalyze deuteration with a half-life of approximately 3 minutes.

While this system is different from the specific catalysts mentioned in the question, it illustrates how the composition, structure, and reaction conditions of a metal-based catalyst can influence its mechanisms and efficiency in alkane transformations. The ability to activate C-H bonds at low temperatures could be significant for industrial applications, though the industrial significance is not directly addressed in the given text.

The literature does not directly address vanadium oxides, metal-exchanged zeolites, or oxidative dehydrogenation. However, it does discuss a silica-supported zirconium hydride catalyst that is relevant to alkane transformations:

This catalyst ((=SiO)3ZrH) is capable of activating C-H bonds at room temperature and performing low-temperature hydrogenolysis of alkanes to methane and ethane. Its exceptional properties in C-H and C-C bond activation are attributed to its highly electrophilic nature (formally 8-electron) and lack of steric hindrance (four-coordinate structure).

The catalyst shows selectivity in C-H bond activation, with primary C-H bonds of propane reacting seven times faster than secondary C-H bonds during catalytic deuteration at room temperature. 

While this doesn't directly answer the question about vanadium oxides or zeolites, it demonstrates how the composition and structure of a supported metal catalyst can influence its reactivity and selectivity in alkane transformations. The ability to activate C-H bonds at low temperatures and the selectivity for primary over secondary C-H bonds could be industrially significant for alkane conversion processes.
