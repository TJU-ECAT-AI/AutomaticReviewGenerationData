[1] "The stoichiometric reaction between propane and (=- SiO)3ZrH leads to the formation of a mixture of (=- SiO)3ZrCH(CH3)2 and (-= SiO)3ZrCH2CH2CH3."

[2] "The catalytic deuteration of propane by deuterium at room temperature catalysed by (=- SiO)3ZrH showed that the primary C-H bonds of propane reacted seven times faster than the secondary C-H bonds."

[3] "The exceptional properties of this catalyst in the field of C-H and C-C bond activation are ascribed to the very electrophilic (formally 8 electron) and sterically unhindered (four coordinate) nature of the zirconium hydride complex."

This document does not directly address supported vanadium oxides, metal-exchanged zeolites, or oxidative dehydrogenation processes. However, it does provide some insights into alkane transformations using a supported zirconium hydride catalyst:

The study focuses on a silica-supported zirconium hydride catalyst (=- SiO)3ZrH for propane activation. This catalyst shows selectivity in C-H bond activation, with primary C-H bonds reacting faster than secondary C-H bonds. The catalyst's effectiveness is attributed to its electrophilic nature and lack of steric hindrance.

While this doesn't directly answer the question about industrial significance, it demonstrates how catalyst composition and structure (in this case, a supported zirconium hydride) can influence reaction mechanisms and efficiency in alkane transformations. The study provides an example of how detailed understanding of catalyst properties and reaction selectivity can contribute to developing more efficient catalytic processes for alkane transformations.

这篇文档没有直接涉及负载型钒氧化物、金属交换的沸石或氧化脱氢过程。然而，它确实提供了一些关于使用负载型锆氢化物催化剂进行烷烃转化的见解：

该研究关注硅胶负载的锆氢化物催化剂(=- SiO)3ZrH用于丙烷活化。这种催化剂在C-H键活化中表现出选择性，伯C-H键的反应速度快于仲C-H键。催化剂的有效性归因于其亲电性和缺乏立体位阻。

虽然这并没有直接回答关于工业重要性的问题，但它展示了催化剂的组成和结构（在这种情况下是负载型锆氢化物）如何影响烷烃转化的反应机理和效率。该研究提供了一个例子，说明对催化剂性质和反应选择性的详细理解如何有助于开发更高效的烷烃转化催化过程。
