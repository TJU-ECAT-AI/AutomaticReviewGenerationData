ABSTRACT 
The zinc-exchanged 
(ZSM-5-Zn) and proton-exchanged 
(ZSM-5-H) forms of ZSM-5 
zeolite have been studied for the conversion of propane to aromatic hydrocarbons 
at temperatures 
in the range 730-820 K. ZSM-5-Zn was the more active and gave 
the better BTX selectivity 
(60-7OC%). Other reaction products were Cl-C2 hydro- 
carbons and C9, aromatics. 
In all cases, the propane conversion increased with 
increasing reaction temperature 
and the proportion of BTX increased, although this 
trend was more pronounced 
in the case of ZSM-5-Zn. Catalysts deactivated 
slowly 
on stream with a decrease 
in conversion 
in the range 4-85 per hour. The propane 
conversion fell with increasing space velocity over both types of catalysts. 
Over 
ZSM-5-H the BTX selectivity 
decreased with increasing 
space velocity, while over 
ZSM-5-Zn the BTX selectivity 
increased to a small extent. 
The main features of the conversion mechanism are proposed involving propane 
dehydrogenation, 
followed by oligomerization 
and aromatization. 
Cracking to Cl-C2 
products is a concurrent 
reaction. The primary dehydrogenation 
reaction is 
mechanistically 
different on the two types of catalyst: over ZSM-5-H dehydrogenat- 
ion is rate controlled, 
while over ZSM-5-Zn this step is in quasi-equilibrium. 
INTRODUCTION 
Catalysts derived from 
ZSM-5 zeolite have been extensively 
studied for the 
conversion of methanol or olefins to highly aromatic hydrocarbon mixtures suitable 
for incorporation 
into high-octane 
gasoline [l-4]. Reaction of alkanes (particular- 
ly n-alkanes) 
of carbon number 2 6 over ZSM-5-H zeolite is facile at 673 K and 
gives benzenoid aromatic hydrocarbons 
as major products [4]. Reaction becomes 
progressively 
more difficult as the carbon number of the reactant 'alkane is lowered 
for propane temperatures 
of 750-800 K are required. Such high temperatures 
might 
be expected to favour aromatic products. Thus there exists the technical possibil- 
ity of conversion 
of liquefied petroleum gas selectively 
to aromatic hydrocarbons 
(c.f. references 
[5,6]) suited to high-octane 
gasoline and other uses.

data for the reaction 
over ZSM-5-H catalysts. Some comments are made about the mechanism of the convers- 
ion. 
EXPERIMENTAL 
Apparatus 
The microreactor 
was constructed 
from quartz tubing of 46 cm length and 6 mm o.d. 
bent into a symmetrical 
U, and heated by a tube furnace. The gas entry arm of the 
U served as a gas pre-heater, 
and the catalyst sample was positioned 
in the second 
arm, between two quartz-wool 
plugs up against an "open" porous silica frit. A 
stainless-steel-sheathed 
thermocouple 
was pressed up against the exit plug to keep 
the bed compact and to measure the catalyst temperature. 
The quantity of catalyst 
was 0.15-0.2 g. 
Gases, supplied from cylinders 
(C.P. grade, C.I.G. Ltd.,) were metered to the 
reactor via rotameters. 
Gaseous reactants 
(propane, propylene, 
butane or ethane) 
were fed directly to the'preheating 
zone of the reactor, as were diluent gases 
such as nitrogen or hydrogen, and catalyst regeneration 
gases such as oxygen or 
3 
.-I 
air. Total gas flow rates 
were in the range Z-20 cm min 
. Experiments were 
conducted at a nominal total pressure of 1 atm. 
The effluent gas from the reactor tube was diluted with nitrogen or argon make- 
up gas in the hot region about 10 cm down-stream 
from the catalyst bed, then passed 
via a small U-trap to gas-chromatographic 
analysis, The U-trap and transfer lines 
were maintained 
at 320-340 K and a high flow rate of make-up gas was maintained 
to prevent product condensation. 
Product analysis was carried out using a Varian 
3700 gas chrornatograph fitted-with 
FID detectors. 
Two GC columns were used: OVIOI 
on Chromosorb W used for most products, and Porapak Q for C,-C3 components. 
Catalysts 
ZSM-5 zeolites of varying aluminium contents were prepared, analysed and 
characterized 
as previously described 
(ref. 7 and references therein). 
The zinc-exchanged 
forms of ZSM-5 were made by neutralizing 
the protonic forms 
with a slight excess of dilute aqueous ammonium hydroxide, shaking overnight, 
filtering, 
then exchanging twice with a large excess of dilute zinc nitrate 
solution at 373 K (overnight reflux). Cadmium-exchanged 
forms were prepared in an 
analogous manner. 
Measurements 
of the heat of sorption of ammonia gas were made using a LKB model 
2107 Microcalorimeter.

RESULTS 
ConversSon of propane 
Most work was done using reactant propane, with subsidiary experiments 
using 
n-butane, ethane and propylene. 
Over the protonic form of ZSM-5 (ZSM-5-H), the conversion of propane became 
significant at temperatures 
above about 730 K, and typical results are contained 
in Table 1. This table also contains results at the same reaction temperature 
and 
space velocity for propane conversion over the corresponding 
zinc-exchanged 
catalyst (ZSM-5-Zn) and over a ZSM-5 zeolite (silicalite) 
of extremely low alumin- 
ium content. These data show: (a) that ZSM-5-Zn yields a rather higher propane 
conversion and better BTX selectivity 
than the protonic form, and (b) that the 
activity of silicalite 
is relatively very low. 
The reaction of propane was examined as a function of space velocity over 
ZSM-5-H and ZSM-5-Zn catalysts 
(both 1.28 wt% aluminium) at typical reaction 
temperatures, 
and the data for conversion and product distributions 
are summarized

aromatics remained approximately 
constant: the proportion of Cl,2 products was 
also independent of space velocity. 
As indicated in Table 1, the composition 
of the C,,2 products was considerably 
different over ZSM-5-H and ZSM-5-Zn in that reaction at a low space velocity over 
ZSM-5-H gave relatively 
larger proportions 
of methane and ethylene. Nevertheless, 
the composition 
of the C,,2 fraction varied with space velocity over both catalysts. 
The data are recorded 
in Figure 2 where it is seen that, with both catalysts, 
there is a strong trend for the fraction of ethylene in the C2 fraction to increase 
at the expense of ethane as the space velocity is increased.

The ZSM-5-Zn catalysts studied had aluminium contents ranging from 0.71 to 
2.32 wt%. The conversion of propane and the nature of the product distributions 
were approximately 
independent of aluminium content in the range 1.28-2.32 wt%. 
For an aluminium content of 0.71 wt% the conversion 
level was below that for the 
other catalysts under the same reaction conditions by a factor of about 2, although 
the product distribution 
was again invariant. 
In all cases the propane conversion increased with increasing reaction tempera- 
147 
ture, and Figure 3 presents detailed data for the temperature 
dependence of 
conversion and product distribution 
over both ZSM-5-H and ZSM-5-Zn catalysts of 
1.28 wt% aluminium content. The apparent activation 
energies, obtained from 
Arrhenius plots of the propane conversions, 
were ZSM-5-Zn (I.28 wt% aluminium), 
121+15 kJ mol-'; ZSM-5-Zn (0.71 wt% aluminium), 
104+15 kJ mol-'; ZSM-5-H (1.28 wt% 
aluminium), 
120t15 kJ mol-'. As seen in Figure 3, over both the protonic and zinc- 
exchanged catalysts, the proportion of BTX increased with increasing temperature, 
although the trend was more pronounced 
in the zinc case, 
With increasing time on stream , all ZSM-5-Zn catalysts deactivated 
slowly. 
Since this deactivation 
was accompanied 
by blackening of the catalyst bed, it is 
probably due to coke deposition. 
At reaction temperatures 
in the range 743 to 834 K, 
the rate of deactivation 
was reflected in a decrease in the conversion 
ranging from 
4 to 8% per hour, although for periods up to about 2 hours on stream the BTX 
selectivity 
remained approximately 
constant. 
Addition of hydrogen to the reactant had a significant 
effect on propane con- 
version over ZSM-5-Zn. Experiments were carried out using catalysts of 1.28 wt% 
aluminium 
(at 774 K) and 2.32 wt% aluminium 
(at 745 K), with feeds consisting of 
propane (3-5 cm3 min-' ) either alone or diluted with equal flows of nitrogen or 
hydrogen. Dilution with nitrogen had no effect on the product distribution, 
although it resulted in a small (18%) reduction in the level of propane conversion. 
On the other hand, dilution with hydrogen resulted in a 37% reduction in the pro- 
pane conversion, 
and a 30% reduction in the aromatic content of the products (with 
a corresponding 
increase in the proportion of C,,2 products). The composition 
of 
the C,,2 products remained essentially 
independent of dilution by hydrogen. 
Over ZSM-5-H catalyst 
(1.28 wt% aluminium, reaction at 770 K), dilution of 
propane (3 cm3 min 
-1 
), with equal flows of either nitrogen or hydrogen had the 
same result: no change in the product distribution 
with either dilution, but a 
reduction in the level of propane conversion of about 48%. 
Conversion of other hydrocarbons 
Over both ZSM-5-H and ZSM-5-Zn catalysts, ethane reactant was found to be much 
less reactive than propane: at 870 K the extent of ethane conversion'was 
< 5%. 
n-Butane was converted readily over ZSM-5-Zn catalysts under conditions 
similar 
to those used with propane, giving generally similar results. 
The conversion of propylene was also studied over a ZSM-5-Zn catalyst at 774- 
804 K. In all cases the propylene conversion was essentially 
complete. The results 
are contained in Table 2. 
Demethylation 
of p-xylene 
Extensive isomerization 
and a little (5-10%) disproportionation 
to toluene and 
trimethylbenzene 
occurred when p-xylene (1.2 mg min-') was syringe-fed 
to a 
catalyst bed of ZSM-5-H or ZSM-5-Zn (0.20 g) in a stream of nitrogen vector gas

Ammonia sorption calorimetry 
The differential 
heat of sorption of ammonia gas was measured for a ZSM-5 
sample (1.13 wt% Al) in its protonic form, and for the same sample in the fully 
Zn2+ 
-exchanged form (ZSM-5-Zn). The heat of sorption of ammonia was generally 
rather higher on ZSM-5-Zn than on ZSM-5-H, with this difference 
being most marked 
at low uptakes (e.g. (0.5 x 10m3 
1o-3 
-1 
mol NH3 g-l). Thus, at an ammonia uptake of 0.1 x 
mol NH3 g 
, the heats of sorption were 144 and 175 kJ mol 
-' on ZSM-5-H and 
ZSM-5-Zn respectively. 
In both cases, the heat of sorption fell with increasing 
uptake, reaching about 40 kJ mol 
-1 for an uptake of 3 x 10m3 
-1 
mol NH3 g 
.

DISCUSSION 
The data far the heat of adsorption 
Zn have very strong maximum acidity. 
The propane conversion 
results show 
of ammonia show that both ZSM-5-H and ZSM-5- 
that zinc-exchanged 
catalysts are more act- 
ive than the corresponding 
protonated forms; thus, it is seen from Table 1 that, 
at comparable 
reaction temperatures, 
the extent of propane conversion over ZSM-5-Zn 
was about 1.5 times that obtained over ZSM-5-H, and the BTX Selectivity 
over ZSM-5- 
Zn was about 2 times greater. The data in Table 1 also show that both ZSM-5-H and 
ZSM-5-Zn are much more active than the corresponding 
alUminiUm-free 
(non-acidic) 
sjlicalite. 
Thus, both the zinc and hydrogen forms of ZSM-5 contain catalytic 
functions which are essential to the conversion of propane at temperatures 
in the 
vicinity of 770 K. At a much higher temperature, 
e.g. 999 K, Table 1, the convers- 
ion of propane over silicalite becomes substantial: 
we shall return to a discussion 
of this point subsequently, 
but we note here that a radical reaction Pathway may 
well be involved, rather than one involving the carbenium 
ion intermediates 
which 
are generated via the active functions of ZSM-5-H and ZSM-5-Zn. 
The first step in the conversion of propane over ZSM-5-H and ZSM+Zn 
is likely 
to be dehydrogenation 
to propylene (either propylene itself or an adsorbed ProPYT- 
ene such as iso-C3H;), and so it is convenient to consider first the reaction of 
propylene over ZSM-5. We note that the equilibrium 
constant (KP) for the 
dehydro- 
genation of propane to propylene has values of 1.03 x lo- 
atm at 730 K and 5.04 x 
10-2 atm at 790 K, indicating equilibrium 
propylene pressures of 1.0 x lo-' atm 
and 2.2 x 10 
-' atm at these respective 
temperatures 
and a propane pressure 
of 1 atm, 
Propylene is highly 
reactive 
over acidic ZSM-5-H catalysts at temperatures 
above 
about 600 K giving a mixture of benzenoid aromatic and alkane products QI. Olefin 
protonation 
and consequent oligomerization 
(see reaction 1) are the most facile 
reactionsy but oligomerization 
iS reversible, and a combination 
of the reverSe 
(cracking) process together with oligomerization 
and olefjn alkylatjon 
reactions

The main pathway for aromatization, 
at least over protonic catalysts, probably 
involves C81 first the formation of an unsaturated

ly. The nature of the hydride abstraction 
reaction involved in aromatic genesis 
depends on reaction temperature. 
Thus, at lower propylene reaction temperatures 
(e.g. 673 K, ref. 4), an examination of the product distribution 
data shows that 
there is a quantitative 
relationship 
between the proportions 
of aromatic and 
paraffinic 
(nz3) reaction products in the sense that the number of hydrogens 
required to be lost in the formation of the aromatics 
is equal to the number of 
hydrogens required to be gained in the formation of the paraffins. A similar 
equivalence 
has been noted previously 
in the conversion of methanol [9]. This 
equivalence 
implies that hydride is abstracted by carbenium ion attack (with con- 
version of carbenium ion to paraffin). 
By contrast, the product distribution 
data recorded in Table 2 for the convers- 
ion of propylene over ZSM-5-Zn at 774-804 K show that at these high temperatures 
the paraffinic 
(nr3) products only account for IO-205 of the hydrogen which must 
be eliminated 
in the formation of the aromatic components, 
and we suggest the 
balance appears ultimately as gaseous Hp. 
We turn now to the conversion of propane. When propane (or higher alkanes) 
undergo conversion, 
the most probable route for initial carbenium ion formation is 
by hydride abstraction,

iso-C3H; 
(3) 
Olefin may be formed by deprotonation 
of iso-C3H; thus allowing oligomerization 
and other reactions to proceed in a manner analogous to that outlined previously. 
In the case of the ZSM-5-Zn catalyst, we suggest the zinc cation acts as a hydride 
acceptor to give a transient species such as [Zn-HI+ (and thence hydrogen), 
C3H8 
+ 
iso-C3H;(s) + [Zn - HI;,) 
We note that it is well known that zinc oxide can produce heterolytic 
cleavage 
of carbon-hydrogen 
bonds, and a species of the type [Zn-H]+ is reasonably well 
established 
[la]. In the case of ZSM-5-H a protonic site may act as a hydride 
acceptor (to give hydrogen directly).

The data in Table 1 for the reaction of propane over (non-acidic and zinc-free) 
silicalite show that if the temperature 
is high enough (e.g. 909 K), conversion 
can be substantial. 
However, under these conditions 
the nature of the reaction 
products is quite different to that obtained over the acidic catalysts: aromatic 
products are of negligible 
importance, and the reaction is almost entirely confined 
to dehydrogenation 
to propylene and cracking to C, and C2 hydrocarbons. 
Although 
the silicalite may have possessed some trace acidity due to residual trace of 
aluminium, the great differences 
in the reaction temperature 
regime and product 
distribution 
suggests that this reaction involved a quite different mechanism from 
that over acidic catalysts. The product distribution 
obtained at 909 K over 
silicalite 
is quantitatively 
similar to that obtained in a thermal reaction under 
similar conditions of temperature 
and conversion 
[II], which strongly suggests a 
radical chain mechanism. 
A comparison of the data in Tables 1 and 2 shows that the conversion of propane 
over ZSM-5 catalysts is accompanied 
by the formation of considerably 
greater amounts 
of cracked (C,, C2) products than are obtained from propylene. 
It is clear that 
the enhanced level of C,, C2 production from propane, particularly 
over ZSM-5-H,

We now turn to the question of the possible contribution 
of a radical-chain 
mechanism to propane conversion over ZSM-5 catalysts. We have noted that the main 
products obtained from propane over ZSM-5-H catalysts are different from those 
obtained, probably by a radical-chain 
mechanism, 
over silicalite, 
but resemble 
those obtained from propylene over ZSM-5-H catalysts by a carbenium ion mechanism. 
Thus, if a radical-chain 
mechanism makes any contribution 
to the conversion of 
propane over ZSM-5-H catalysts, 
it must be limited to contributions 
to the 
formation of propylene (which then undergoes conversion, 
mainly to aromatic hydro- 
carbons, over the acidic function), and to cracking to C, and C2 products. 
The way in which ZSM-5-H might be able to initiate a radical-chain 
reaction 
remains a matter for conjecture. 
However, it is known [lZ] that adsorption of 
aromatics or olefins on high silica zeolites can involve electron transfer pro- 
cesses and the generation of some radical species which can be detected by EPR. 
Alternatively, 
ZSM-5-H may induce homolysis of a C-H bond (reaction 6), 
R-H 
+ H-OZeol 
+ 
R' 
+ H2 
+ 'OZeol 
(6) 
By contrast, over ZSM-5-Zn only a small proportion of methane is formed dis- 
tinguishing 
it from the reaction over ZSM-5-H and silicalite. 
This leads to the 
conclusion that a radical-chain 
mechanism probably does not make a significant 
contribution 
to propane over ZSM-5-Zn. 
Two other possible mechanisms for propane cracking require mention. First MC 
Vicker et al. [16] have proposed that cracking involves the formation and decompos- 
152 
ition of a radical-ion 
at an electron acceptor site (EA) (reaction 7), 
C3H8 + EA = 
[C3H8f1 Cdl 
+ 
CH4 + C2H4 + EA 
(7) 
Secondly, Haag and Dessau [I31 have proposed possible protonation 
at a primary 
carbon (reaction 8),

The C2 product from propane is not only ethylene, as would be implied by radical- 
chain cracking mechanisms 
or by reaction 8. Ethane is a major product, probably 
because of secondary hydrogen transfer reactions, while over ZSM-5-Zn some ethylene 
hydrogenation 
can also occur. 
ZSM-5-H and ZSM-5-Zn show quite different dependences 
of selectivity 
upon space 
velocity (c.f. Figures 1 and 2). Over ZSM-5-H, the selectivity 
for total aromatic 
products and for BTX decreases with increase in space velocity, consistent with 
aromatization 
being a late step in the overall reaction sequence, having been 
preceded by oligomerization/cracking 
reactions which generate the required precurs- 
ors of carbon number >6. A similar trend is observed in the conversion of methanol 
[9] over this type of catalyst for the same reason. 
On the other hand, in the conversion of propane over ZSM-5-Zn, a different 
behaviour was observed. With increasing space velocity the total aromatic content 
of the reaction products remained constant, and the BTX content increased to a 
modest extent. We suggest that this different behaviour compared with the protonic 
form of the catalyst has its origin in the basically different aromatization 
mechanisms. 
As pointed out in the previous discussion, 
aromatization 
on 
ZSM-5-Zn 
generates hydrogen, as opposed to the hydride transfer mechanism which operates 
over ZSM-5-H (and which generates paraffins). 
We note that over ZSM-5-Zn catalyst hydrogen was found to have a specific 
effect on both the level of propane conversion and on the BTX content of the 
products (both reduced). We suggest that these effects arise because the respective 
dehydrogenation 
steps are in quasi-equilibrium, 
with reaction 4 controlling 
the 
conversion and a dehydrogenation 
between aromatic and cyclic precursor controlling 
the BTX selectivity 
(both processes may well involve species of the type [Zn-HI+, 
c.f. reaction 4. On the other hand, it was found that over ZSM-5-H catalyst, hydro- 
gen had no specific effect on the conversion of propane or on the product distribut- 
ion (except for a dilution effect which was the same as given by nitrogen): 
in this 
case analogous quasi-equilibria 
cannot be presumed, in agreement with the nature 
of the processes summarized in reactions 5 and 2. That reaction 5 is slow and 
effectively 
irreversible 
is also in agreement with an earlier observation 
[43 that 
153 
hydrogen was without effect on the conversion of propylene over ZSM-5-H. 
On the basis of this discussion, 
it would be expected that both the level of 
propane conversion and the BTX selectivity would be improved by the addition of a 
hydrogen scavenging reagent (e.g. oxygen) over ZSM-5-Zn, but this would have 
little effect over ZSM-5-H. 
The proposal that over ZSM-5-Zn the BTX-forming 
dehydrogenation 
process is in 
quasi-equilibrium 
(while over ZSM-5-H it is not), also provides an explanation 
for the different behaviour of the BTX selectivity with changing space velocity 
over the two catalysts 
(c.f. Figure 1). We suggest that over ZSM-5-Zn the 
relatively 
high rate of hydrogen diffusion in the zeolite channels results in in- 
creasing depletion of the local hydrogen concentration 
with increasing space 
velocity, thus moving the equilibrium 
in the direction of BTX formation. Over 
ZSM-5-H on the other hand, this equilibrium does not exist and the BTX selectivity 
falls with increasing space velocity in the manner outlined in an earlier part of 
the discussion 
in relation to the conversion of propylene. 
We also note that the model discussed above for control of BTX formation agrees 
with the observed effects of temperature 
on BTX selectivity 
(c.f. Figure 3): in 
the case of ZSM-5-H, where dehydropenation 
is kinetically controlled, 
increasing 
temperature 
increases the rate; in the case of ZSM-5-Zn, increasing the temperature 
moves the equilibrium 
towards increased BTX. 
Propane (or propylene) conversion at higher temperatures 
(2770 K) over ZSM-5-H 
and ZSM-5-Zn results in an enhanced proportion of benzene in the BTX product: and 
this may also be compared with the trace of benzene formed [4] from propylene at 
lower temperatures 
(e.g. 673 K). In fact, benzene is not an expected product from 
the aromatization 
process outlined in reaction 2 because of the improbability 
of 
occurrence of a primary carbenium ion. The increased proportion of benzene probably 
arises from a demethylation 
reaction. Such reaction has been demonstrated 
using 
p-xylene as a model reactant. However, the demethylation 
reaction is not a simple 
hydrogenolysis 
(e.g. Aryl-CH3 + H2 + 
Aryl-H + CH4): the light hydrocarbon pro- 
ducts from p-xylene comprise C,-C3 hydrocarbons. 
The mechanism by means of which 
these C,-C3 products are produced in this reaction remains uncertain, but may 
possibly involve the conversion of polymethylaromatic 
to alkylaromatic 
(e.g. xylene 
to ethylbenzene), 
followed by dealkylation 
(e.g. ethylbenzene 
to benzene and 
ethylene). A process of this type has been previously 
reported [14] over a nickel 
sulphide/silica-alumina 
catalyst, and some mechanistic 
suggestions 
have been more 
recently elaborated 
[I51 with respect to carbenium 
ion chemistry. 
The present results suggest that part of the C,-C3 hydrocarbon product formed 
in propane conversion over the present ZSM-5 catalysts, 
particularly 
ZSM-5-Zn, 
may have arisen from secondary demethylation 
reactions of aromatic products.
