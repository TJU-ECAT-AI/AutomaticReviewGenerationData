Abstract
Hydrogen (H/D) exchange between Brnsted acid sites of both the acidic form of zeolite beta (H-BEA) and Zn-loaded zeolite beta (Zn/H-BEA)
and small alkanes (methane and ethane) has been studied by monitoring the kinetics of the exchange in situ with 1H MAS NMR spectroscopy
within the temperature range of 433563 K. On Zn/H-BEA, the exchange has been found to be more than two orders of magnitude faster compared
to that on H-BEA. The decrease of reaction temperature and activation energy of the exchange on Zn/H-BEA (8688 kJ mol1) compared to the
acidic form of zeolite H-BEA (138 kJ mol1) has been rationalized by the promoting effect of zinc. We propose that the mechanism of the H/D
exchange on Zn/H-BEA involves Zn-alkyl species as intermediates.

1. Introduction
Zn-modified zeolites are effective catalysts for light alkanes
aromatization [14]. The enhanced selectivity of alkane con-
version (ethane [57] and propane [8,9]) towards aromatics is
attributed to dehydrogenation ability of the loaded zinc species.
It has been claimed [2,3] that strong Lewis sites, which are
generated by zinc, change the mechanism of alkane activation
and transformation from the beta scission to a dehydrogenation
step. The alkenes formed under dehydrogenation then undergo
a dehydrocyclooligomerization. Both Brnsted acid sites and
Zn sites are involved in dehydrocyclooligomerization and pro-
duce finally the aromatic compounds [3,8,10,11].
Kazansky et al. [1214] demonstrated the formation of
strong adsorption complexes between small alkanes and Zn2+
cations by IR spectroscopy. They claimed that the activation of

the alkane molecules in zeolite occurred on Zn2+ cations. But
a combined IR and NMR study by Ivanova et al. [15] indicated
that the activation could alternatively occur on small ZnO clus-
ters, which were located in the pores of the zeolite. Formation
of Zn-alkyl species during alkane activation has been reported
in both cases [1215].
The role of possibly formed Zn-alkyl species, as well as the
Brnsted acid sites, in small alkane activation requires further
clarification. A reaction of hydrogen H/D exchange between
acid sites of the zeolite and alkane molecule could help to
establish the mechanism of alkane activation on Zn-loaded ze-
olites. Indeed, a hydrogen exchange between the acid sites of
solid catalysts and alkane molecules, which precedes usually
the chemical transformation of alkane on acid catalysts [16], is
often used to characterize the activation of alkanes and acidity
of the catalysts [1728]. A combination of experimental H/D
exchange kinetics data with theoretical analysis of the possible
intermediates of the exchange reaction provides valuable infor-
mation on the mechanisms of the alkane molecule activation
and the H/D exchange on solid acid catalysts [1719]. In this

paper, we consider the hydrogen H/D exchange between small
alkanes (methane and ethane) and Brnsted acid sites of both
Zn-loaded zeolite beta (Zn/H-BEA) and its pure acidic form
(H-BEA).
2. Experimental
2.1. Materials characterization and samples preparation
The acidic form of the zeolite beta (H-BEA) (Si/Al = 18,
average crystal size 0.10.2 m) was synthesized using tetra-
ethyl-ammonium hydroxide as template with subsequent calci-
nation at 823 K in an air flow for 6 h [29]. Chemical analysis
yielded the chemical composition: Na0.475H2.845Al3.32Si60.68-
O128.
Zinc-loaded zeolite beta (Zn/H-BEA) was prepared by im-
pregnation of the zeolite H-BEA with a saturated solution of
zinc formate, subsequent drying at 473 K for 14 h and further
calcination at 673 K for 4 h in a flow of air. The Zn con-
tent in the obtained zeolite Zn/H-BEA was 7.2 wt%. Zeolites
were characterized by XRD, SEM, TEM, UVvis and IR dif-
fuse reflectance spectroscopy, and 1H, 27Al, 29Si MAS NMR
spectroscopy. A silicon-to-aluminum ratio of 18 in the zeolite
framework obtained by 29Si MAS NMR analysis [30], was in
agreement with chemical analysis. The 27Al MAS NMR spec-
trum exhibited only a signal at 54 ppm due to tetra-coordinated
framework aluminum atoms for both H-BEA and Zn/H-BEA
samples. The residual quantity of the acidic SiOHAl groups in
a final Zn/H-BEA was 320 mol g1, whereas the quantity of
these groups was 480 mol g1 in the parent zeolite H-BEA.
Concentrations of the acidic groups were obtained by the analy-
sis of the intensities of signals of SiOHAl groups in 1H MAS
NMR spectra of Zn/H-BEA or H-BEA by comparing their in-
tensities with that of methane as internal standard.
XRD analysis has demonstrated the presence of bulk ZnO
phase in Zn/H-BEA. UVvis diffuse reflectance spectrum of
Zn/H-BEA exhibits the bands at 265 and 370 nm due to sub-
nanometric ZnO clusters inside zeolite pores and due to macro-
crystalline particles of ZnO on the external surface of the zeo-
lite, respectively [31].
Methane-d4 (99% D) and ethane-d6 (99% D) purchased
from Aldrich Chemical Company Inc. were used without fur-
ther purification. The samples for NMR measurements were
prepared by heating 80 mg of the zeolite sample in the glass
tubes of 5.5 mm outer diameter. The samples were activated by
an increase of the temperature from 300 to 673 K at the rate of
10 K h1 under vacuum. Further, the samples were maintained
at 673 K for 24 h under vacuum (less than 102 Pa). The load-
ing was performed at room temperature with 1.15 molecules
(ca. 300 mol g1) of alkane per unit cell and each sample was
then sealed off (length of the glass tube = 10 mm). This glass
tube could be tightly inserted in 7 mm zirconia rotors. Before
acquisition of the signal, the NMR probe with the sample was
preheated for 20 min at the temperature at which the H/D ex-
change did not yet occur at notable rate. This temperature was
400 K for Zn/H-BEA and 473 K for H-BEA zeolite samples, re-
spectively. Then the temperature was rapidly increased within
310 min by 40100 K to the reaction temperature, equilibrated
for 12 min, and then the acquisition of NMR signal started. It
should be noted here that any noticeable chemical conversion
of methane or ethane did not occur under conditions of our ex-
periment, so the H/D exchange was the main transformation of
the alkanes.
2.2. NMR measurements
NMR spectra were recorded at 9.4 T on a Bruker Avance-
400 spectrometer equipped with high temperature broad-band
double-resonance MAS probe. Zirconia rotors (7 mm outer
diameter) with the inserted sealed glass tube were spun at 3
5 kHz by dried compressed air at 300568 K. 1H MAS spectra
were recorded by the Hahn-echo pulse sequence (π/2τπτ
acquire), where τ equals to one rotor period (200333 s).
The excitation pulse length was 4.5 s (π/2), and typically
624 scans were accumulated with a 626 s delay. In double-
resonance 1H{27Al} TRAPDOR experiments [32,33] a Hahn-
echo sequence was applied to the 1H channel with irradiation
of aluminum during the both τ periods. The 27Al nutation fre-
quency of the irradiation field was about 70 kHz. 27Al MAS
spectra were acquired with a short π/12 radio-frequency pulse
(0.6 s), and about 1000 scans were accumulated with a 0.5 s
recycle delay. 29Si MAS spectra were recorded with π/2 exci-
tation pulse of 5.0 s duration, and 1015 s repetition time, and
1000 scans for signal accumulation. Both 27Al and 29Si NMR
spectra were recorded using 4 mm rotors and a spinning rate of
10 kHz. The chemical shifts were referenced to TMS for 1H and
29Si NMR and to 0.1 M Al(NO3)3 solution for 27Al NMR. The
sample temperature was controlled by the Bruker BVT-2000
variable-temperature unit. The calibration of the temperature
inside the rotor was performed with an accuracy of 2 K by us-
ing lead nitrate, located inside the rotor, as a 207Pb MAS NMR
chemical shift thermometer [34].
2.3. IR measurements
IR spectra were recorded on a Bruker Vector 22 FTIR spec-
trometer with a DTGS detector and 2 cm1 resolution and
50 scans for signal accumulation. Zeolite samples were pressed
in self-supporting discs (diameter: 1.5 cm, 1020 mg cm2) and
activated in the IR cell, attached to a vacuum line, at 723 K
for 2 h at 102103 Pa. The adsorption of CO for testing
the Lewis acidity was performed at 77 K at 131333 Pa CO
pressure. Assessment of Lewis acidity was performed on the
base of the absorbance bands at 21702230 cm1 belonging to
CO coordinated to Lewis site [35]. Among the bands observed
for Zn/H-BEA at 21702230 cm1, the band at 2212 cm1
was attributed to CO coordinated to isolated Zn2+ cations, the
band at 2190 cm1 to CO coordinated to small ZnO clusters
and the band at 2170 cm1 to CO on bulk ZnO phase. Quan-
titative estimations of Lewis sites in accordance to procedure
described in Ref. [35] have shown that concentration of Lewis
acid sites was ca. 30 mol g1 for H-BEA and ca. 110 mol g1
for Zn/H-BEA.

3. Results
3.1. Characteristics of hydroxyl groups of the H-BEA and
Zn/H-BEA with IR and NMR
The IR spectrum of OH groups of H-BEA zeolite exhibits
well-known [3646] five signals, see Fig. 1. The signal at
3745 cm1 belongs to the terminal and internal at frame-
work defects SiOH groups. The signal at 3610 cm1 is due
to strongly acidic bridging hydroxyl groups. The broad band
at 36003300 cm1 is assigned to bridged hydroxyls which
are perturbed by H-bond interactions with the zeolitic frame-
work [43,45]. The signal at 36603680 cm1 belongs to the
acid OH groups connected to Al partially attached to the frame-
work and located on external surfaces [37,38]. The band at
3790 cm1 is attributed to low-acidity OH groups bonded to
extra-lattice aluminum [37,39]. Similar bands are observed for
Zn/H-BEA.
Fig. 1. IR spectrum of zeolite H-BEA.
1H MAS NMR spectra of both H-BEA and Zn/H-BEA show
three main signals, see Fig. 2. The signals at 4.0 and 5.1 ppm
are due to the free bridged and hydrogen-bonded bridged hy-
droxyls (SiOHAl), respectively, and the most intense signal at
1.7 ppm arises from SiOH groups at framework defects and ex-
ternal SiOH groups [40,41,44,45]. The intense signal of SiOH
groups is a result of the faulted structure of the zeolite beta
(BEA) [47,48]. 1H{27Al} spin-echo double resonance (TRAP-
DOR [32,33]) experiments show the suppression of signals of
protons that are not far from the next aluminum atom like SiO-
HAl or AlOH groups, while signals of protons far to the next
aluminum atom are unaffected. On-resonance 27Al irradiation
for one rotor period (200333 s) results in a loss of intensity
of three resonances in the 1H{27Al} MAS NMR spectrum of
the zeolite H-BEA (Fig. 2b). The difference spectrum (Fig. 2c)
shows four clearly distinguishable resonances at 5.1, 4.0, 2.6
and 1.0 ppm for H-BEA and a similar spectrum for Zn/H-BEA.
The TRAPDOR difference spectrum strongly supports the IR
data on the presence of two types of the OH groups associated
with non-framework aluminum species. The signal at 2.6 ppm
corresponds to the band at 36603680 cm1, and the signal at
1.0 ppm to the band at 3790 cm1.
The 27Al MAS NMR spectrum of as-synthesized H-BEA
exhibited only the signal of the framework aluminum atoms
at 54 ppm. But the formation of a small quantity of extra-
framework aluminum can occur during the sample activation
under vacuum. Samples of H-BEA and Zn/H-BEA, which were
first activated at 670 K and then rehydrated, contained a small
amount of extra-framework aluminum species, which gave rise
to a weak signal (a few percent with regards to the signal inten-
sity at 54 ppm) at 5 ppm. Extra-framework aluminum species in
the activated but not rehydrated sample can build AlOH groups,

(b) with 27Al irradiation (on resonance). The difference spectrum of (a) and (b) is shown in (c). The spinning speed was set to 3 kHz for H-BEA and 5 kHz for
Zn/H-BEA, and τ was equal to one rotor period. Zeolite H-BEA was loaded with CD4, which exhibited a residual protium signal at 0.0 ppm. Asterisks (*) belong
to the spinning sidebands.

which give a signal at 1.0 ppm in the 1H MAS NMR spectrum
of dehydrated sample (Fig. 2). This means that a small quan-
tity of extra-framework aluminum is created during the sample
activation under vacuum.
3.2. Which OH groups of the zeolites are involved in the
exchange?
During the H/D exchange between zeolitic OH groups and
fully deuterated alkane molecules, the intensities of OH groups
involved in the reaction should decrease, while the intensity of
the alkane molecule signals increases in the 1H MAS NMR
spectrum. Fig. 3 shows the 1H MAS NMR spectra of H-BEA
with adsorbed CD4 recorded before and after H/D exchange.
The negative peaks in the difference spectrum (Fig. 3c) belong
to the OH groups of the zeolite which are involved in the ex-
change. It is evident that both the acidic SiOHAl groups with
chemical shift of 4.05.1 ppm and non-acidic SiOH groups
with the chemical shift of 1.7 ppm are involved in the H/D
exchange. For Zn/H-BEA both SiOHAl and SiOH groups are
involved in the exchange as well. The experiments by Kramer
et al. [17] on the pure-silica form of MFI, which contains no
bridging OH groups, have shown that silanol groups are not
active in the H/D exchange process. The simultaneous replace-
ment of silanol and acidic hydroxyl groups by deuterium in
acidic zeolite was attributed to an intra-zeolite exchange of hy-
drogen, possibly assisted by trace amounts of water [49,50]. In
Fig. 3. 1H MAS NMR room temperature Hahn-echo spectra of zeolite H-BEA
with adsorbed methane-d4 before (b) and after (a) reaction of H/D exchange at

sponds to the residual protium in 99% deuterium enriched methane-d4. Aster-
isks (*) denote the spinning sidebands.
the present study, the observed involvement of SiOH of the ze-
olites H-BEA and Zn/H-BEA in the exchange (Fig. 3) should
be attributed to more rapid exchange between zeolite SiOH and
SiOHAl groups, compared to the H/D exchange between hy-
drogens of SiOHAl groups and the alkane molecules.
3.3. Kinetics model
The kinetics of the exchange was analyzed assuming a par-
allel scheme of H/D exchange. In this scheme, all deuterium
atoms in alkane exchange consecutively by the protium of
the SiOHAl groups. In parallel, there is also a hydrogen ex-
change between SiOHAl and SiOH groups. Reactions (R1)
(R5) in Table 1 were used for modeling the H/D exchange of
methane-d4. Reactions (R1)(R4) describe a consecutive ex-
change with SiOHAl groups. Reaction (R5) takes into account a
transfer of hydrogen atoms between SiOHAl and SiOH groups.
In a similar manner, the Reactions (R6)(R12) describe the
exchange of SiOHAl groups with both ethane-d6 and SiOH
groups. For each of the alkanes under study, the reaction rate
constants were assumed to be equal for all consecutive stages
of the exchange of the SiOHAl groups with alkane, i.e., the rate
constants kSiOHAl were similar for the Reactions (R1)(R4) or
the Reactions (R6)(R11).
The reaction of isotopic substitution in a general form is
CDkHak + SiOHAl CDk1Hak1 + SiODAl,
(1)
where C designates carbon atoms in alkane molecule, a is the
total contents of hydrogen isotopes in alkane molecule and k
and k1 are the contents of deuterium in alkane. For a binomial
distribution of isotopes under the exchange [26,51], the equilib-
rium constants Keq (Table 1) are
(2)
Keq =
 a
k1
a
k
with
a

k!(a k)!.
The kinetic scheme does not take into account the formation of
penta-coordinated carbon atom of the alkane or zinc-alkyl frag-
ment, which will be further discussed as the intermediates of
the exchange reaction. The formation and expenditure of penta-
coordinated carbon atom of alkane or zinc alkyl species can be
fast and their concentration is low, so the kinetic scheme for the
exchange reactions (Table 1) reflects only a direct exchange of
OH groups and the hydrogen atoms of the alkane molecules.
For intra-zeolite exchange (Reactions (R5) and (R12) in Ta-
ble 1) a possible assistance of exchange by water traces is not
reflected in kinetic schemes as well.
For the simulation of the experimental kinetic data we used
a static model [52]:

in the alkane molecules and OH groups (intensities of the cor-
respondent signals in the 1H NMR spectrum) were calculated
by the equations

temperature was raised and equilibrated at 558 K and the last spectrum (top)
after 4110 min of the reaction duration. The time between subsequent spectra
recording was 60 min.
The rate constants kSiOHAl and kintra were determined by fit-
ting the experimentally obtained concentrations of protium in
methane ([H]CH4) or ethane ([H]C2H6), SiOHAl ([H]SiOHAl) and
SiOH ([H]SiOH). Accuracies of the rate constants were in the
range of 1040% as determined from the spread of the experi-
mental points on the kinetic curves.

increasing signal at 0.0 ppm belongs to methane CDmH4m
(m = 03). Two decreasing signals at 4.0 and ca. 5.1 ppm arise
from SiOHAl groups. The signal at 1.7 ppm has mainly a con-
tribution from terminal SiOH groups and decreases also with
the reaction time. The growth of the signal at 0.0 ppm and si-
multaneous decrease of the signals at 4.0, 5.1 and 1.7 ppm is

due to a transfer of protium from SiOHAl to CD4 and due to
intra-zeolite H/D exchange between SiOHAl and SiOH groups.
Simulation of experimentally obtained kinetic curves for the
alkane and both acidic and non-acidic hydroxyl groups (Fig. 5)
in accordance to the parallel scheme of the exchange (Table 1)
offers the rate constants for both the alkane exchange with
Brnsted acid sites and intra-zeolite exchange between SiOH
and SiOHAl. The obtained values of kintra are at least 4 times
higher than kSiOHAl (Table 2). This is in a good accordance
with earlier conclusions that the rate of intra-zeolite exchange is
faster than the rate of exchange between zeolite and alkane [17,
49,50]. Since the exchange rate between SiOHAl groups and
alkane molecules on zeolite H-BEA is very slow, we were able
to estimate only the lower limit for kintra. The Arrhenius plot for
kSiOHAl (Fig. 6) gives the activation energy of 138 kJ mol1,
which is in good agreement with values earlier experimen-
tally [17,22,23] and theoretically [1719,21,24,27,28] obtained
for acidic zeolites.
3.5. H/D exchange of methane-d4 and ethane-d6 on Zn/H-BEA
1H MAS NMR spectra of methane-d4 (or ethane-d6) ad-
sorbed on Zn/H-BEA show similar changes like for methane-d4

adsorbed on H-BEA. The intensity of the signal from the alkane
increases while the intensities of both SiOHAl and SiOH de-

that for Zn/H-BEA the exchange is already notable at 430 K.
The exchange approaches equilibrium within 20 min at 508 K,
whereas for H-BEA this equilibrium would be reached only af-
ter 30 days at 508 K.

kintra are given in Table 2. For Zn/H-BEA, the rates of the H/D
exchange between SiOHAl groups and the alkanes are compa-
rable with rate of intra-zeolite exchange (kSiOHAl kintra). The
rate kintra can be determined with a better accuracy than for ze-
olite H-BEA. Arrhenius plots of the exchange rate constants
versus the reciprocal temperature offer the activation energies
for these reactions (Figs. 10 and 11). The activation energies
are in the range of 8688 kJ mol1 for the exchange between

are similar for methane and ethane. The activation energy for
intra-zeolite hydrogen exchange is 70  25 kJ mol1.
4. Discussion
A significant hydrogen exchange between molecules of
methane and ethane, as the most inert alkanes, and SiOHAl
groups of acidic forms of zeolites can be usually observed
within the temperature range of 623773 K [17,22,23,54]. Ter-
minal SiOH groups are not involved in the exchange [17].
Activation energies are 120150 kJ mol1 for the exchange

of methane and ethane on acidic zeolites [22,23] or silica alu-
mina [54]. The exchange is accepted to occur in a concerted
step involving a penta-coordinated carbon atom [1719,21,24,
27,28,55].
For the H/D exchange of methane on H-BEA, we find activa-
tion energy of 138 kJ mol1 and a reaction onset above 548 K.
It is in good agreement to early studies of the methane exchange
on acidic zeolites [22,23]. This allows us to conclude that the
mechanism of the exchange involves penta-coordinated carbon
atom in a transition state [1719,2125,27,28,55].
For Zn/H-BEA, the kinetic parameters of H/D exchange
change dramatically. The rate constants kSiOHAl are at least

Scheme 1. Possible mechanisms of the H/D hydrogen exchange for methane-d4 on Zn/H-BEA with involvement of Zn-alkyl species: (a) intermediate Zn-alkyl is

two orders of magnitude higher. The activation energy of 86
88 kJ mol1 is rather low. The exchange proceeds with a no-
table rate at temperatures at least 100 K lower compared to that
on H-BEA. The lower apparent activation energy for the ex-
change on Zn/H-BEA and the low temperature range of this
reaction imply a promoting effect of Zn on the reaction of
the H/D exchange. The mechanism of the exchange seems to
be different from that usually accepted for pure acidic zeo-
lites [1728,55].
It has been recently shown by IR spectroscopy that ad-
sorption of small alkanes like methane and ethane forms Zn-
alkyl species on zeolites Zn/H-ZSM-5 [1214,56]. Theoretical
studies have also indicated a possibility of the formation of
Zn-alkyl species during the adsorption of methane and ethane
on Zn-loaded zeolites [57,58]. Cross polarization (CP) [59]
can enhance NMR signals from strongly adsorbed species. By
using 13C CP MAS NMR technique, we could confirm that
at temperatures above 473 K a small quantity of Zn-methyl
or Zn-ethyl species form on Zn/H-BEA from methane [60]
or ethane [60,61]. Kazansky et al. [1214] have shown that
Zn-alkyl species may be formed on Zn2+ cations. However,
Ivanova et al. [15] demonstrated by NMR and IR spectroscopy
that Zn-alkyl species might be also formed from propane on
ZnO clusters for the zeolite with large content of the loaded
zinc (ca. 8 wt%).
We have recently observed a regioselective H/D exchange
for propane on Zn/H-MFI [62]. It has been concluded that
the regioselectivity can be rationalized either by the protona-
tion/deprotonation steps with the acidic OH groups of the inter-
mediate propene or by involvement of Zn-alkyl species, which
are formed on either Zn2+ cations or ZnO clusters [62]. For the
exchange of methane on Zn-loaded zeolite, only the involve-
ment of Zn-alkyl species can be realized, since the intermediate
alkene cannot be formed from methane. So, Zn promotes the
exchange by providing the H/D exchange with involvement of
the formed Zn-alkyl species. The analysis of the Zn state in our
Zn/H-BEA indicates that both possibilities for the formation of
Zn-alkyl species, on either Zn2+ cations or ZnO clusters, are
plausible. Both Zn2+ cations and sub-nanometric ZnO clusters
are found inside the pores of Zn/H-BEA (see Section 2).
Scheme 1 shows the possible mechanisms of the H/D ex-
change for methane (or ethane). This scheme is similar to
the mechanism for the regioselective exchange of propane on
Zn/H-MFI [62]. Scheme 1a offers the mechanism with involve-
ment of Zn-alkyl species, which are formed on ZnO clusters.
Dissociative adsorption of the deuterated alkane on zinc oxide
sites (small ZnO clusters, located inside zeolite pores) leads to
Zn-alkyl species and Zn-OD groups [15]. Protonation of the
zinc-alkyl species by the nearest acidic OH group of the ze-
olite with synchronous reverse transfer of the deuterium from
the ZnOD to the zeolite acid site, provides finally a transfer of
protium from the SiOHAl group to the alkane molecule.
Alkane molecules adsorbed on Zn2+ cations located at
neighbor [63] or distantly separated [64] basic oxygens of
SiO()Al groups in the zeolite framework can also provide a
heterolytic dissociative adsorption of the alkane. It offers the
formation of zinc-alkyl fragments and the acidic protons of the
SiOHAl group. A reversible formation of zinc alkyl and acidic
OH groups from the alkane and Zn2+ cations and an involve-
ment of the residual SiOHAl groups of the Zn-loaded zeolite
can provide a hydrogen exchange between the adsorbed alkane
and SiOHAl groups. Scheme 1b shows a possible mechanism
of the exchange for methane (it can also be applied to ethane),
which involves Zn-methyl fragments formed on Zn2+ cations.
In this scheme OZ2 and OZ3 represent the basic neighbor or
distantly separated oxygens of SiO()Al groups in the zeolite
framework. HOZ1 is the residual SiOHAl group that remained
in the zeolite after Zn-loading. HOZ1 groups should be in vicin-
ity of Zn2+ cations. In this case, the transition state (depicted
in Scheme 1b in square brackets) can be formed, and the H/D
exchange can occur.
It should be noted that the H/D exchange is faster for the
more inert methane than for ethane: kSiOHAl is ca. three times
larger for methane, see Table 2. This may be due to the different
stabilities of Zn-methyl and Zn-ethyl species. Indeed, according
to theoretical studies by Barbosa et al. [57,58] and Yakovlev et
20
A.G. Stepanov et al. / Journal of Catalysis 253 (2008) 1121
al. [65] Zn-methyl species should be more stable than Zn-ethyl
ones.
5. Conclusion
In situ 1H MAS NMR monitoring of the kinetics of the
H/D hydrogen exchange between small alkanes, methane and
ethane, and acidic form (H-BEA) and Zn-loaded form of zeolite
beta (Zn/H-BEA) allowed us to draw the following conclusions.
Kinetic parameters of the exchange between methane and
H-BEA are similar to those earlier obtained for this alkane on
acid zeolites. The activation energy is 138 kJ mol1 and the re-
action occurs slowly at temperatures in the range 548563 K.
Hydrogen exchange between Brnsted acid sites of Zn/H-BEA
and small alkanes (methane and ethane) occurs with a notable
rate at a temperature 100 K lower compared to that on H-BEA.
The rate of exchange is more than two orders of magnitude
higher compared to that on H-BEA. The decrease of the tem-
perature of the reaction and the essentially higher rate and lower
activation energy (8688 kJ mol1) compared to H-BEA are
attributed to the promoting effect of zinc in zeolite. The pro-
motion may consist of involvement of Zn-alkyl species in the
exchange. They can be formed either on ZnO clusters or Zn2+
cations, located on neighbor or remote SiO()Al groups.
