Abstract
The catalytic dehydrocondensation of methane to benzene and naphthalene with a bulky of hydrogen on transition metal
supported zeolite catalysts is one of strategies for the catalytic conversion of methane and a challenging topic in heterogeneous
catalysis. This paper is dealt with the current progress in catalytic dehydrocondensation of methane towards benzene and
naphthalene on transition metal supported zeolite catalysts, in terms of templating role of zeolite micropores and metallic sites
on Mo and Re supported zeolite catalysts. The effect of zeolite supports and active metallic phases in conjunction with the
reaction conditions are discussed. The results of investigation on the carbonaceous deposits and the synergetic effect between
the transition metal components and the zeolite supports, as well as, the active species and reaction mechanisms are revealed
by the TPO/XPS/FT-IR/EXAFS and solid NMR studies.  2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

1. Introduction
With the declining of crude oil reserves, the energy
supply is changing from being primarily oil based to
become more gas based. Methane is the major com-
ponent of most natural gas reserves, hence, it is im-
portant to investigate the conversion of methane from
the potential utilization of natural gas. On the other
hand, methane is the most stable and symmetric or-
ganic molecule consisting of four CH bonds with
bond energy of 435 kJ/mol, accordingly, the investiga-
tion of methane conversion also is a great challenge
from the aspect of catalysis science.

A number of strategies are being explored for the
catalytic conversion of methane to more useful chem-
icals and fuels as reviewed by Lunsford [1]. The cat-
alytic conversion of methane can be divided into two
groups, which are described as indirect and direct. The
indirect processes rely upon the production of synthe-
sis gas, either by reforming reaction or by partial ox-
idation, followed by FischerTropsch chemistry. For
the latter transformation route, methane can be con-
verted to the desired products, e.g. ethylene, methanol,
formaldehyde, and aromatics, directly. To date, the
greatest potential for advance in methane conversion
technology is the discovery of direct transformation
route for the formation of methanol and formaldehyde
[24]. The oxidative coupling of methane as an alter-
native route for the direct conversion of methane had
been extensively studied since 1982. The splitting of

CH bond is likely from the interaction between CH4
and the surface oxygen species [5]. A C2 selectivity
of 80% with a CH4 conversion of 20% can be ob-
tained over SrO/La2O3 [6] and Mn/Na2WO4/SiO2 [7]
catalysts. However, no catalysts could reach C2 yield
above 25% and selectivity to C2 higher than 80%, and
thus limit its industrial application.
Many processes related with methane conversion,
whether direct or indirect route, require the use of
oxygen, so the deep oxidation of methane is unavoid-
able. In order to suppress the formation of undesirable
products such as CO and CO2, many researchers
tried to transform methane into higher hydrocarbons
in the absence of oxygen. Mitchell and Wanyhorne
[8] reported that methane could be activated over
M/MOn/MO multi-component catalyst at 977 K
to form benzene and/or the carbonaceous deposit.
Belgued et al. [9] demonstrated that methane could
be transformed into higher hydrocarbons over a sup-
ported Pt catalyst via a two-step route. Bragin et al.
[10] found the aromatization reaction of methane to
benzene over PtCrO3/HZSM-5 catalyst at 1023 K in
a pulse-reactor.
In 1993, Wang et al. [11] reported that methane
could be transformed to benzene in a flow mode reac-
tor on transition metal ions supported HZSM-5 cata-
lysts under non-oxidative condition. Since then, many
research groups concerned this catalytic process and
made inspiring efforts. Up to now, the research work
on this reaction can be sorted into the following parts.
(1) Catalyst modification in terms of templating role
of zeolite micropores and metallic sites in conjunction
with optimization of reaction conditions. (2) Study of
the carbonaceous deposits focusing on the coke sup-
pression and characterization. (3) Synergetic effect be-
tween the metallic sites and the zeolite supports. (4)
Study of the active phases and reaction mechanisms.
Hereafter, we will focus on these aspects to present the
current advances in catalytic dehydrocondensation of
methane towards benzene and naphthalene over tran-
sition metal supported zeolite catalysts.
2. Catalyst modification in terms of templating
role of zeolite micropores and metallic sites
Many researchers have tried a lot of catalysts, in
order to improve the catalyst activity, selectivity and
stability as summarized in [12]. It is generally accepted
that the Mo/HZSM-5 is one of the good catalysts as re-
ported by groups of Xu and co-workers [13,14], Chen
et al. [15], Solymosi et al. [1619], Wang et al. [20,21],
and Liu et al. [22,23]. It is important to note the re-
sults reported by Wang et al. [20,21] and Liu et al.
[22,23], they noticed and analyzed the production of
naphthalene and quantitatively on-line calculated the
coke formation by using the internal standard of N2
and Ar. It also should be noticed that the coke evalu-
ation from GC analysis consists of all the undetected
carbon products such as amorphous and graphitic in-
ert carbons that are difficult to detect and analyze with
on-line gas chromatographs. In order to look at unde-
tected carbon species, Liu and co-workers [23,24] an-
alyzed all the condensable products in the effluent gas
separated for 4 h by using the ethanol-dry ice trap in
the methane reaction at 973 K on 3% Mo/HZSM-5 cat-
alyst. The collected reaction products were analyzed
by the GC/MS with a capillary column (OV-1, 25 m)
up to 553 K and TOFRM (time-of-flight reflect-mass)
spectrometer. The results show that a list of aromatic
compounds, such as benzene and naphthalene as the
major products, and other polycondensed aromatics,
such as anthracene, pyrene, tetracene, and their deriv-
iates which were collected as products of the methane
reaction. Lu et al. [25] testified the internal standard
analysis method by the data of material balance from
a 20 ml bench scale reactor.
Weckhuysen et al. [26] studied the effect of transi-
tion metal ions, the preparation and treatment method.
They found that the activity is in the following se-
quence: Mo > W > Fe > V > Cr. Later, Zeng et al.
[27] reported the WH2SO4/HZSM-5 was a good cat-
alyst for methane aromatization at 1123 K, however,
the formation of coke was neglected. On the other
hand, it should be noted that the addition of a sec-
ond metal component is also studied as shown in [12].
The improvement in enhancing activity or stability has
been obtained by addition with Fe, Co, W, Zr, Ru and
Cu [22,2831].
During the past 8 years, the catalyst modification
in term of zeolite micropores was extensively studied
[23,3237]. Some of typical results are listed in Table
1. Zhang et al. studied the methane aromatization over
Mo-based catalysts supported on different types of
zeolites [32]. It was found that H-type silicaalumina
zeolites, such as ZSM-5, ZSM-8, ZSM-11 and
