The effects of support (Al2O3, SiO2, HfO2, TiO2, and ZrO2) on the
structure and catalytic behavior of supported vanadia in the oxida-
tive dehydrogenation of propane were examined over a wide range
of vanadium surface densities (0.515.0 VOx/nm2). X-ray diffrac-
tion and Raman and UV-visible spectra showed that vanadia exists
as highly dispersed species at surface densities below 7 VOx/nm2
on Al2O3, HfO2, TiO2, and ZrO2, but as large V2O5 crystallites on
SiO2. Surface structures evolve from isolated monovanadates to
polyvanadate domains and V2O5 crystallites as VOx surface den-
sity increases. Polyvanadates appear at lower surface densities on
ZrO2 and TiO2 than on Al2O3 and HfO2. UV-visible edge energies
decrease as VOx domains grow with increasing VOx surface density
on all supports. Initial propene selectivities increase with increasing
VOx surface density, as monovanadate species and exposed support
sites, which favor primary combustion pathways, decrease in con-
centration. Oxidative dehydrogenation rates per V-atom reach a
maximum on VOx domains of intermediate size, which provide a
balance between the activity of surface VOx species and their acces-
sibility to reactants. Interactions with supports determine the type
of VOx structures present at a given surface density, but turnover
rates do not depend on the identity of the support when differences
in VOx structure are taken into account. Oxidative dehydrogenation
turnover rates are similar on polyvanadate species and on surface
VOx sites on bulk V2O5. The relative rates of oxidative dehydro-
genation to form propene and of secondary propene oxidation to
COx do not depend on the identity of the support or on VOx sur-
face density or structure. Thus, it appears that these two reactions
require similar VOx surface sites and that these sites are present at
similar surface densities on polyvanadate domains and small V2O5
clusters.

INTRODUCTION
Oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes provides a ther-
modynamically accessible route to the synthesis of alkenes
from alkanes (13). Supported vanadium oxides (VOx)
catalyze this reaction, but unselective combustion pathways

limit alkene selectivities, especially at high conversions
(418). The local coordination and symmetry of V+5 cen-
ters in bulk and supported V2O5 have been frequently im-
plicated in the observed effects of support, VOx concentra-
tion, and pretreatment procedures on catalytic behavior.
Many of these structurefunction relations remain incom-
plete because of difficult structural characterization, unde-
tected transport restrictions, and kinetic analyses compli-
cated by parallel and sequential combustion pathways.
Theextentofdispersionandthelocalandextendedstruc-
ture of supported VOx species depend on the chemical iden-
tity and the surface area of the support (13, 17, 18). Previ-
ous studies have shown that basic metal oxides (e.g., MgO,
Bi2O3, La2O3, Sm2O3) lead to supported VOx species with
higher alkene selectivities than when acidic oxides are used
as supports (1, 1315). Several authors have proposed that
acidic V2O5 species interact weakly with acidic supports,
leading to poorly dispersed V2O5 crystallites (13, 15).
The structure of selective VOx species and the reaction
pathways in oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes remain
subjects of active discussion. Our recent study (4) com-
binedspectroscopicandchemicalcharacterizationmethods
with detailed kinetic analyses of oxidative dehydrogenation
pathwaysinordertoaddresstheseissuesonVOx/ZrO2cata-
lysts. This work showed that the structure and catalytic be-
havior of these materials depend strongly on VOx surface
density. Polyvanadate species that form on ZrO2 at VOx
surface densities above 34 VOx/nm2 provide active and se-
lective sites for oxidative dehydrogenation reactions. Cata-
lysts with lower VOx surface density and uncovered ZrO2
surfaces show lower alkene selectivities because of compet-
ing oxidation pathways leading to undesired CO and CO2
products.
In this study, we examine the effect of support (Al2O3,
SiO2, HfO2, TiO2, and ZrO2) on the structure and catalytic
behavior of VOx species over a wide range of VOx surface
densities. X-ray diffraction, Raman spectroscopy, and UV-
visible spectroscopy were used to examine the structure
and electronic properties of supported VOx species. Rate

were obtained by kinetic analysis of steady-state oxidative
dehydrogenation rates obtained in differential flow reac-
tors.
EXPERIMENTAL
TiO2 (S
ud-Chemie, AG), Al2O3 (Degussa, AG), and
SiO2 (Davison Chemical) supports were obtained from
commercial sources. Zirconium (ZrO(OH)2) and hafnium
(HfO(OH)2) oxyhydroxides were prepared from the corre-
sponding oxychlorides by coprecipitation at controlled pH
(4). Vanadium was introduced at various concentrations
(Table 1) via incipient wetness impregnation of supports
with aqueous ammonium metavanadate solutions (99%,
Aldrich, Inc.) (4, 21). These solutions also contained ox-
alic acid (Mallinckrodt, analytical grade; NH4VO3/oxalic
acid = 0.5 M) in order to ensure dissolution of ammo-
nium metavanadate precursors. After impregnation, sam-
ples were dried overnight in air at 393 K and treated in dry
air at 773 K for 3 h.
Surface areas were measured in a N2 physisorption flow
apparatus using thermal conductivity detection and multi-
point BET analysis methods. Samples were dehydrated in
He at 473 K for 1 h before surface area measurements.
Powder X-ray diffraction patterns were obtained at room

temperature using Cu (KÎ±) radiation and a Siemens D5000
diffractometer. A small amount of catalyst was mixed with
vaseline, spread smoothly onto a thin glass plate, and placed
in the diffractometer.
Raman spectra were obtained using a HoloLab 5000
Raman research spectrophotometer (Kaiser Optical Sys-
tems, Inc). Samples (0.1 g) were pressed at 70 MPa pres-
sure into wafers (0.9 cm diameter, 0.1 cm thickness) and
mountedinaquartzcell.Thiscellcanbeheatedupto1073K
and gases can be introduced for in situ measurements dur-
ing treatments. Raman spectra were recorded in the 100 to
1300 cm1 wavenumber range using a 532-nm laser line.
Diffuse reflectance UV-visible spectra were obtained
using MgO as a reference in a Varian-Cary 4 spectropho-
tometer equipped with a Harrick diffuse-reflectance attach-
ment. Reflectance data were converted to absorption spec-
tra using KubelkaMunk functions (22). The sample cell
was equipped with a heater unit, a water cooling system,
a thermocouple, and a gas flow system for in situ measure-
ments. UV-visible electronic spectra of samples dehydrated
in situ in dry air at 723 K for 30 min were measured in the
1.56.0 eV energy range at room temperature.
Oxidative dehydrogenation rates and selectivities were
measured in a fixed-bed quartz reactor using catalyst sam-
ples (0.0150.3 g) diluted with quartz powder (0.5 g) in or-
der to prevent temperature gradients. A mixture of C3H8
(14.0 kPa) and O2 (1.74 kPa) in He was introduced into
the reactor at controlled flow rates. Reactant and prod-
uct concentrations were measured by gas chromatogra-
phy (Hewlett-Packard 5880 GC, Carboxen packed column,
thermal conductivity detection). Only C3H6, H2O, CO, and
CO2 were detected as reaction products. Larger product
samples injected into a capillary column also failed to de-
tect any other reaction products. Bed residence times and
C3H8 and O2 conversions were varied by changing the feed
flow rate between 0.5 and 6 cm3(STP) s1. C3H8 and O2 con-
versions were below 1% and 20%, respectively. The rates
of formation of propene, CO, and CO2 were extrapolated
to zero conversion in order to estimate the rates of primary
C3H8 dehydrogenation and oxidation steps. Rate constants
for primary and secondary steps were obtained using a pre-
viously reported kinetic analysis method (4).
RESULTS
Catalyst surface areas and calculated VOx surface den-
sities (ns) are shown in Figs. 1a and 1b and in Table 1 as a
function of V2O5 content for Al2O3, SiO2, HfO2, TiO2, and
ZrO2 supports after treatment in air at 773 K for 3 h. Each
catalyst is identified as, for example, 0.7 VOx/Al2O3, where
0.7 defines the weight loading of vanadia as V2O5. The pres-
ence of VOx had only a modest effect on the surface area
of the support (Fig. 1a). As a result, VOx surface densi-
ties increased almost linearly with increasing V2O5 content

(Fig. 1b). The surface density is defined as the number of
vanadium atoms per square nanometer of the catalyst and
was calculated from the V2O5 content and the BET sur-
face area; it provides a convenient parameter for comparing
catalysts prepared on supports with a wide range of surface
areas. Clearly, at a given vanadium surface density the struc-
ture of VOx species will depend on the ability of a given
support to disperse the VOx species placed on its surface.
The dashed lines in Fig. 1b identify VOx surface densities
corresponding to theoretical monovanadate (2.3 VOx/nm2)
or polyvanadate (7.5 VOx/nm2) monolayers (17).

inhibit the conversion of metastable tetragonal ZrO2 to its
monoclinic form (Fig. 2a), as also reported for WOx and
other oxides supported on ZrO2 (2325). VOx species also
inhibit the crystallization of amorphous HfO2 into mono-
clinic and orthorhombic structures (Fig. 2b), but they do
not influence the crystallinity of the anatase TiO2 structure
present in all VOx/TiO2 samples (Fig. 2e). Bulk V2O5 crys-
tallites were not detected at any VOx surface density within
the experimental range on ZrO2, HfO2, or TiO2 supports
(Figs. 2a, 2b, 2e). Bulk V2O5 crystallites were also not de-
tected on Al2O3- and SiO2-supported samples with low VOx
surface density (<3 VOx/nm2) (Figs. 2c, 2d). Higher surface
densities on SiO2 and Al2O3 lead to the appearance of V2O5
crystallites detectable by X-ray diffraction (Figs. 2c, 2d).

V2O5 crystallites detectable by X-ray diffraction appeared
at lower VOx surface densities on SiO2 (3.5 VOx/nm2) than
on the other supports.
UV-visible absorption spectra reflect the electronic struc-
ture of valence bands in solids, but the broad nature of
charge transfer features in the spectra of metal oxides
makes it difficult to define the position of these bands from
the energy at maximum absorption. Absorption edge ener-
gies provide a more convenient description of the electronic
properties of solids. The absorption edge in all UV-visible
spectra was determined using Taucs law, an expression that
describes the near-edge region in amorphous semiconduc-
tors and in crystalline semiconductors with indirect band
gap transitions (26). Using this expression, the edge en-
ergy is obtained from the intercept of a straight line fitted
through the rise of the function [F(R)hÎ½]1/2 plotted versus
hÎ½ (24), where F(R) is a KubelkaMunk function (22), hÎ½
is the energy of the incident photon. The position of the
absorption edge for low-energy charge transfer transitions
has been shown to correlate with the domain size of semi-
conductors and insulators (24, 2735). The energy at the
absorption edge has been recently used to characterize the
size of MoOx (33), WOx (24), and VOx (4, 35) domains in
catalytic solids.
Typical diffuse reflectance UV-visible spectra are shown
in Fig. 3 for VOx/Al2O3 and VOx/HfO2 samples. Absorption
bands in the 24 eV energy range reflect O2to V5+ ligand-
to-metal charge transfer transitions (3639). The corre-
sponding charge transfer bands in Al2O3, SiO2, HfO2, and
ZrO2 occur at much higher energies and they do not in-
terfere with the analysis of absorption edge regions cor-
responding to VOx centers (Table 2). On TiO2, however,
this band appears at 3.17 eV and overlaps with the corre-
sponding bands in VOx species. In this case, VOx electronic
spectra were obtained by subtracting the TiO2 bands from
VOx/TiO2 spectra.
The effect of VOx surface density on absorption edge
energies is shown in Fig. 4 for the catalyst samples of
this study. The absorption energy for bulk V2O5 (2.05 eV)

calculated using Taucs law is shown as a horizontal line
in Fig. 4. The edge energy decreases with increasing VOx
surface density for all supports, as expected from an in-
crease in the size and dimensionality of VOx domains as
VOx surface density increases. At a given value of surface
density, the identity of the support influences the apparent
dispersion and absorption edge energy of VOx species.
Al2O3 and HfO2 appear to disperse VOx units more effec-
tively than other supports and edge energies remain high
(>2.5 eV), even at surface densities similar to those
expected for polyvanadate monolayers (ns = 7 VOx/nm2).
On silica supported catalysts, edge energies reach very
low values (2.1 eV) at much lower surface densities (23
VOx/nm2) than on other supports. The strength of inter-
actions between VOx and ZrO2 or TiO2 supports appears
to lie between the extremes observed on Al2O3 and SiO2
supports (Fig. 4), because absorption energies lie between
those measured on VOx/Al2O3 and VOx/SiO2 supports.
