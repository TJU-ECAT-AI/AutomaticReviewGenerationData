Oxidations carried out by means of vanadium oxide catalysts
P. MARS and D. W. VAN KREVELEN
Staatsmljnen in Limburg, Central Laboratory, Geleen, Netherlands
Summary-All technically interesting reactions carried out with vanadium oxide catalysts
arc marked by their highly exothermic character, whieh forms an impediment to the Investi-
gation of the kineties of these processes.
In the present study use was made of a fluid bed, in
which the temperature is uniform.
The oxidation of the following substances:
benzene,
toluene, naphthalene, and anthracene has been studied,
The partial pressures of the reacting substances were varied to the greatest possible extent.
Both reaction components appeared to influence the reaction rate.
A formula depicting this
influence is derived.
This formula may be interpreted by assuming two successive reactions,
namely the reaction between the aromatic and the oxygen on the surface, and the re-oxldatlon
of the partly reduced surface by means of oxygen.
The formula may be reduced to an equation by which also the data on the oxidation of sul-
phur dioxide by means of vanadium oxide catalysts found in the literature are well described.
Using kinetic data it is possible to determine the optimum temperature distribution in a fixed
bed reactor used for the oxidation of sulphur dioxide and to make calculations of the ratio be-
tween the amounts of catalyst to be used in the various stages of a multiple-stage reactor.
The
results of these calculations have been compared with practical experience.

INTRODUCTION
In various manufacturing processes vanadium
catalysts play an important part. In particular,
the oxidation of sulphur dioxide with air (the
.. contact process "), the oxidation of naphthalene
to phthalic anhydride and, to a less degree, the
oxidation of benzene to maleic anhydride over
this type of catalyst arc widely applied in tech-
nical processes. In an analogous manner toluene
can be oxidised to benzaldehyde and benzoic acid,
anthracene to anthraquinone, methyl alcohol to
formaldehyde,
whereas from
aliphatic hydro-
carbons a large number of oxidation products
(aldehydes, ketones and acids) can be derived.
Precisely those reactions which arc of great
importance in chemical industry arc strongly
exothermic.
This has been a difficulty both for
the technical realization and for the studying of
the kinetics of these reactions.
Because of the fact that oxidation by means
of vanadium oxide catalysts finds much applica-
tion in the authors' organisation, it was considered
important to investigate the technological bases
of these processes.
For this investigation the
catalytic oxidation of aromatic hydrocarbons was
chosen as the starting point, as this oxidation
proceeds as an irreversible reaction, so that there
is no need to take into account the influence of
the equilibrium position.
The conclusions, how-
ever, have a much wider scope and in principle
apply also to reversible reactions.
By way of
example we shall consider the contact process for
the production of sulphuric acid.
With the aid
of the reaction kinetics further information on the
design and performance of the apparatus will be
derived.
1.
OXIDATION OF AnOMATIC COMPOUNDS ON
VANADIUM OXIDE CATALYSTS
The reaction may be viewed as an oxidation-
reduction process: the substance to be oxidized
reduces the catalyst, which Was oxidizedby oxygen
from the air.
The oxidation reaction preper can
be carried out without oxygen being present: by
heating, say, anthracene with
nnadium perr-
oxide in the absence of air a good-yield of the
oxidation product (anthraquinone) is obtained. In
this proccss the catalyst is reduced to vanadium
tetroxide (SENSlllIAN [1]).
However, a catalyst
which is in interaction with an oxidizable sub-
stance and air willalso be partly in the tetravalent
state. This was found by W. SCHREIDER[2], who
weighed a catalyst actively engaged in the oxida-
tion of naphthalene. Previously, J. 1\L WEISS [8]
had already arrived at the same 'conclusion by
determining tetravalent vanadium in the catalyst
in the benzene oxidation.
By comparing the activities of one catalyst in
various reactions, additional information about
the reaction mechanism may be obtained.
From
an investigation made by E." B. MAXTED [4] it
appeared that markedly differing oxidations, e.g,
that of naphthalene to phthalic anhydride, that
of benzaldehyde to benzoic acid and that of
toluene to benzoic acid, invariably show a good
yield at about the same temperature.
The fact
that the operating tcmperature of a catalyst
proves to be independent of the substance to be
oxidized, justifies the presumption that the rate
is mainly determined by the reoxidation of the
catalyst.
P. H. CALDERDANK [5] carried out experiments
on the oxidation of naphthalene and concluded
that,
within a
wide
temperature range,
the
.. chemosorption of oxygen by the catalyst"
determined the gross reaction rate.
Experimental Part
As the kinetic data on the reactions taking place
on this type of catalyst were incomplete and, in
part, unsatisfactory, we decided to perform an
investigation into this matter in our laboratory.

P. MARS and D. W. VAN KREVELEN : Oxidations carried out by means of vanadium oxide catalysts
Because of the above-mentioned difficulties a fluid
bed was applied.
With this method, the tem-
perature differences
in
the catalyst bed
are
negligible, while the temperature level can be
adjusted in a simple manner.
Apparatus
A diagram of the apparatus used is given in
Fig. 1.
In a .. Pyrex" tube with an internal
diameter of 43 mm, the catalyst powder (par-
water are formed. The organic oxidation products
obtained from
toluene are
benzaldehyde and
benzoic acid. Naphthalene yields naphthaquinone
and phthalic anhydride, while from anthracene
the oxidation products anthraquinone and phtha-
lic anhydride are obtained.
The reaction pro-
ducts (together with the non-converted aromatic
substance) were condensed by cooling them to
-
BOC (in the case of benzene -
90C), and
subsequently analysed.
These

by means of an external heating wire, the tem-
perature being kept constant by a relay system.
The variations in temperature remain within 0'6C
A study was made of the oxidations of benzene,
toluene, naphthalene and anthracene.
When
benzene is oxidized, benzoquinone, maleic anhy-
dride and carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide and

carried out in the following way: of the aromatics
the refractive indices were determined in n-
hexane;
the quinones were analysed by reduc-
tion with titanium trichloride, and benzcldehyde
by the hydroxylamine reaction;
the acids were
titrated with lye.
The amount of CO and CO2
was measured by converting the CO into CO
2
with hopealite, binding the CO
2 to soda lime, and
weighing.
In the experiments, the partial pressures ofthe

The dynamic state ofthefluid bed
The gas velocity in these experiments was kept
constant, because the conversion changed in a
manner difficult to describe if variations occurred
in the
gas vclocity or in the amount of catalyst.
Therefore, efforts were made to keep the dynamic
state of thc catalyst particles circulating in the
bcd constant throughout the experiments,
If, in
a fluid bcd, the linear gas velocity increases or
the amount of catalyst decreases, the number of
bubbles
passing
through
the
bed
is
greatly
increased.
As the interaction between bubbles
and catalyst becomes much less intensive the
reaction rate measured experimentally falls off.
J. W. ASKINS et ai. [6] performed measurements
on a large catalyst bed to examine the composition
of the gas at various heights in thc bed.
The
diffcrenccs in concentration measured wcrc only
small. These investigators concluded that a fluid
bed
reactor must be
considered an intensive
mixer.
As the dynamic situation in a large catalyst
bed may diffcr considerably from the situation
in a small bcd, it seemed possible that the mixing
in a fluid bed of smaller diameter is not so
thorough and that in elaborating the kinetics of
reactions carried out in such
ri. bed the usual
mathematical methods might be followed.
This problem of the mixing of the gas in a
fluid bed is of importance in the interpretation
of our measurements only in that wc want to
know whether the partial pressures/of the com-
ponents vary with the height of the bed or arc
kept constant owing to the mixing.
For this
reason we measured the partial pressure of naph-
thalene as a function of the bed height under
the same conditions as were
applied for
the
kinetic measurements,
By means of a sampling
tube a small amount of gas was taken from the
bed and after washing with lye to
absorb the
phthalic anhydride and naphthaquinone formed,
the naphthalene concentration was determined
with an ultraviolet absorption meter.
The results of .thcse measurements arc shown
in Fig. '1-.
From this figure it can be seen that
the concentration in the bed gradually decreases
in the direction of the flow, from which it follows
that the entering and outgoing gil" streams are

aromatic hydrocarbons and of the oxygcn were
varied, while the other variunts: splice velocity
and temperature, were kept constant. The par-
tial oxygen pressure was varied between 80 and
760 mm Hg, the partial pressure of the aromatic
reactant between 1 and 30 mm Hg,
Typical con-
version curves arc shown in Fig. 2 and 3.
Both partial pressures proved to influence the
gross reaction rate.

For this reason we
consider the reactor to be an integrating converter
in the circumstances applied in our experiments.
Discussion of Results.
Kinetic Basic Equation
In what way should the influences of the partial
pressures of the aromatic hydrocarbon and of the
oxygen on the reaction rate be interpreted?
Calculations of the mass transfer in a fluid bed,
using the known relations, show that in the border-
line case, where the external diffusion of the
aromatic component would determine the gross
reaction rate, the number of molecules reacting in
a given period surpasses the number actually
reacting in the experiments by at least 100 times.
Neither docs the diffusion in the pores of the
catalyst restrict the reaction rate, as appeared
from an application of the formulae developed
by TIIIELE [7] and WAGNER [8].
If adsorption of the substance to be oxidized
on the reduced part of the surface should be a
condition of the reaction,
there would
be
a
maximum rate at certain partial aromatic and
oxygen pressures.
As such a maximum rate was
never found we imagine the reaction to take place
between the aromatic compound and the oxygen
present on the underlying catalyst surface.
The structure of crystalline vanadium pentoxide
induces us to attribute a catalytic action to certain
oxygen ions.
For, in the vanadium pentoxide
lattice two kinds of oxygen ions may be distin-
guished.
The greater part of the oxygen is
present ill about the same plane as the vanadium
ions. Two-fifths of the ions, h-owever, are arranged
in planes parallel to and alternating with the
first
[9] (sec Fig. 5).
We suppose the latter

oxygen ions to interact with aromatic molecules
at the surface.
The rate of oxidation will then
depend on the concentration of these oxygen ions
(which will in the following be called the degree
of coverage, by the oxygen, and referred to by B),
and on the amount of aromatic molecules adsorbed
on or coming down upon the surface from the
gaseous phase.
The degree of occupation will
automatically be fixed at a certain value, depend-
ing on the rate of the reaction of the oxygen on
the surface with the substance to be oxidized and
the rate of re-oxidation of the reduced surface.
This is in agreement with the experiment: if
the reaction is carried out at high partial pressure
of the oxygen and/or low partial pressure of the
aromatic. the colour of the catalyst wiII be yellow-

were determined. Identical k2 values were found,
in conformity with our expectations (see Fig. 10).
Only the k2 value for toluene showed a deviation,
about the cause of which we are not clear.
The numerical values of the reaction constants
are
such that under technical conditions
the
influence of the oxygen pressure will be greater
than that of the partial pressure of the aromatic
compound.
The kinetics of the benzene reaction can also
be described in this way.

Thus it may be understood why the most differ-
ent substances arc oxidized on V20 S in the same
temperature range (MAXTED [4]) and further, how
CALDERDANK [5] could find the initial rate of
oxidation of naphthalene to be proportional to
(Po )0'96. For, at constant k1 and PR' formula (6)
can: for a wide range of Po , very well be approxi-
,
mated with the following formula:
iR = const, (po)m
where m < 1.
Also in this process we have a great heat
release during the reaction:
S02 + !02 -- S03 + 23 k.eaIjmol
However, this reaction differs from the oxidation
of aromatic compounds in that it is reversible.

for those cases in which SOa is present we must
take into account the fact that this reaction
product strongly reduces the reaction rate. This
mllY be due to the affinity of the SOa to the

In
practice
the
gas
is
usually
eonvertcd
adiabatically in scvcrallayers of catalyst. Between
the catalyst beds there arc heat exchangers, by
means of which the temperature distribution can
be controlled.
Fig. 11 shows this distribution in
such a reactor,
'I'he catalyst bed may, e.g., be
distributed over two converters. In thc first the
gas is converted rapidly but very incompletely
owing to the unfavourable value of the equilibrium
constant i the second converter is operated at a
lower tempcrature level,
so
as
to
make the
reaction as nearly complete us possible.
All the
kinetic formulae given for this process in litera-
ture show that the reaction product S03 strongly
reduces the reaction rate.
For this reason we
will
first
consider the
reaction rate in the border-line case, when the
formation of SOa is still negligible,
JE. L. KlllCHEVSKAYA [11] carried out experi-
ments with pure vanadium pentoxide under such
conditions that the external and internal diffusion
did not influence the reaction rate. When extra-
polating her experimental results to infinite space
velocity (contact time = 0), the influence of a
small rise in temperature caused by the heat of
reaction is eliminated at the same time.
The
experimental results are expressed by formula (6)
with n = ! (see Fig. 12).

The oxygen content of the

From Fig. 18 it is seen that the
experimental results are described by equation
(12), if n = 0'5(2).
From the values found for
K*, it appears that equation (13) is, indeed, a
good approximation at high conversion.
Previously,

process on a technical catalyst [14]. They found
that the reaction rate for conversions between

formula

In a later publication G. K.
BORESKOV [15]
mentions the possibility of the internal diffusion
interfering 'with the kinetic measurements in their
experiments.
P. H. CALDERBANK'S experiments [16] were
performed with a technical catalyst containing,
besides about 10% V20 ", some percents ofK2S04•
This investigator determined the reaction rate as _
a function of the gas velocity at five temperature
levels and three different gas compositions. How-
ever, two of the gas mixtures chosen deviate from
the usual compositions in that they are deficient
in oxygen.
On this account it is not possible
to check by this relation the influence of the
partial pressure of the oxygen.
As the gas
velocity was varied over a sufficiently wide range
formula
(12) can
be
checked
(sec Fig.
14).
(Formula 12 is used here for the same reason as
in checking the results of B. NEUMANN.)
This
formula
provcs
to
describe
the
results
with
satisfactory accuracy.
(2) Since in these experiments the conversions are smalland
therefore SOs-eoncentration is low in comparison with the
S02-concentration, the term K*pso. may not be neglected;
since further the conversions are Car from equilibrium,
formula 12 can be applied in its integrated form.

reaction)
may,
however,
influence
the
gross
reaction rate.
For the calculation of the "external mass
transfer" - i.e, the transfer from the bulk of the
gas to the external surface of the catalyst grain-
the relationships arc well known.
It is also
possible to
estimate in a simple manner the
influence of the" internal transport," viz. of the
rate of diffusion in the catalyst pores on the
overall reaction rate for the- special ease of a
first-order reaction, by means of the formulae
elaborated by TIIIELE [7] and WAGNEU [8].
However, in case of a reaction such as the one
discussed here, these formulae cannot be applied,
as exactness would here lead to very complicated
formulae [17].
A simple consideration of the diffusion in a
pore of a catalyst grain enables us to estimate
roughly the alteration of the kinetic equation as
a result of this internal mass transfer.
Taking a pore (which, for the sake of simplicity,
is imagined to be cylindrical) and considering only
the mean reaction and diffusion rates, wc may
write (see Fig. 15) :

reactor may be controlled.
Fig. 11 shows
a
typical temperature curve.
In converter 1 the
gas is converted at high temperature, rapidly, but
owing to the unfavourable position of theequili-
brium, incompletely.
After heat exchange with
the gases flowing towards the converter has taken
place, the degree of conversion is raised as far as
possible in converter 2, which operates at lower
temperature.
Converter 1 contains three layers
of catalyst, converter 2 comprises 'five catalyst
beds.
The catalyst is in the form of kieselguhr
blocks of 0·8 X 1·1 X 1·1 em, impregnated with
potassium-eontaining vanadium oxide.'
From our kinetic equation we will now draw
conclusions relating to the following points: .
1.
The temperature distribution in the reactors;
2.
The distribution of the catalyst;
3.
The size of the catalyst grains;
4.
The composition of the reaction gas.

Table 8. It appears that both in the first and in
the second converter the reactor rate is strongly
reduced by the rate of diffusion in the pores: the
effectiveness factor of the catalyst grains in the
layers we examined did not exceed 45% and 20%
for the two converters.
This implies that we cannot use formula (14)
but that we have to use formula (15) tocalculate
the reaction rates and the activation energy. The
apparent activation energy proved to be about
9 kcal /mol.
For the re-oxidation reaction of a
vanadium oxide catalyst not retarded by diffusion
we found 22 kcal/mol (see page 7).
Conformable
to theory, it appears that the activation energy
decreases by about a factor 2 if there is internal
diffusion.
This result is important:
the fact
that the rate of the sulphur dioxide oxidation is
largely dependent on internal diffusion in the
catalyst pores, involves that it would be incorrect
to carry out calculations using literature data on
the activation energy.
For every conversion (rJ.) there is a temperature
at which the reaction rate reaches its maximum,
as both k* and Teq (and hence cxeq) are dependent
on the temperature.
By differentiation of formula (15) the optimum
temperature and the maximum reaction rate can
be determined as a function of the conversion ;
in Fig. 16 Toplimum =f(cx) is given.
It appears
that there is a considerable deviation from the
actual temperature distribution.
The question arises as to whether this deviation
is attended by a great drop in potential product-:
ion. An
approximative calculation shows that
I
under optimum temperature conditions the pro-
duction may be appreciably higher than under
the actual conditions.
It should be remarked
that the temperature levels of the two converters
are already so adjusted that the maximum pro-
duction under the actual conditions is attainer-
Temp. k** hr-1
C.
Ad 1.
The optimum temperature distribution can be
calculated in a simple manner if the rate equation
and the apparent activation energy of the reaction
is known.
As the activity of a catalyst may
decrease during the operation we derived the rate
constants at different temperatures from tech-
nical data on a catalyst which had been in use
for some years.
The rate of conversion can be
calculated from the temperature differcnce across
the catalyst bed, since the reaction proceeds
adiabatically within the bed.
From an analysis
we know the concentration of the sulphur dioxide
before the reaction and the degrees of conversion
after the reactions in converters I and 2.
By applying the well-known relation between
reaction conditions and mass transfer it was found
that only in the first layer of converter I docs the
diffusion to the catalyst tablet-surface slightly
reduce the reaction rate. This very small influence
of the external diffusion will be neglected.
It
is
quite
different,
however,
where
thc
influence of the internal diffusion is concerned.
In order to estimate roughly the influence of
the internal diffusion, we used a mean degree
of conversion a in the examined layer, so that
formula (18a) passes into a formula, which des-
cribes an apparent first-order reaction :

Now the formulae of TUIENLE [7] and WAGNER
[8] can be applied as a first approximation.
The diffusion coefficients of 502 -
503 in the
(mean) gas mixture were calculated using GILLI-
LAND'S formula [18].
The ratio of the cffcctive
diffusion coefficient to the diffusion coefficient
proper was determined in the manner described
by C. BOKIIOVEN and J. HOOGSCIIAGEN [19]. For
this calculation the diffusion in the pores was
assumed to proceed according to the laws govern-
ing the normal gas diffusion, while the influence
of the transport along the catalyst surface was
left out of consideration.

It appears that it is important to design the
conversion apparatus in such a way that the
optimum temperature curve can be followed,
although the construction will undoubtedly be
more complicated.
A.d 2.
Under Ad 1 we estimated the optimum temper-
ature distribution. Even, if for technical reasons or
for reasons of heat economy, the optimum temper-
ature curve is not followed in most of the practical
applications, it remains a useful guide for the
temperature level to be applied in the second
converter, while, moreover, it may be used for
checking the performance of the two converters.
For, from the optimum temperature distribution
we can calculate the proportion between the
contact times to be applied for attaining a given
degree of conversion.
Then we know the ratio
between the amounts of catalyst to be used and
we are able to check if the reaction conditions in
.the two converters are well adapted to each other.
A calculation showed that under optimum
conditions the ratio of the amounts of catalyst
necessary to obtain a conversion of from 0 to
81%[converter 1) and a conversion of from 81 %
to 97% (converter 2) should be 23: 77.
The
actual ratio between the amounts of catalyst in
the two converters is 27: 73.
Of course, the
significance of this agreement should not be
overestimated. It may be concluded, howcver,-
that t he distribution of the catalyst is rather
impervious to the temperature distribution.
Ad.8.
It appears that rather large catalyst tablets
arc not very effective.
Table 3 shows that only
45% and 20% of the total catalyst surface parti-
cipate in the reaction at tempcraturcs of 445 and
570C, respectively.
However,
reduction of the tablet size has
several consequences:
(a)
As thc mean diffusion path becomes smaller,
the effectiveness of the catalyst will increase,
(b) In consequence hereof the diffusion will exert
less influence on the reaction rate, involving a
rise of the apparent activation energy of the
55
reaction.
This would result in a rise of the
temperature at which
the
reaction
rate
reaches its maximum for a given value of
the conversion.
(c)
The pressure drop of the catalyst beds would
increase, involving a rise in energy costs.
Ad. 4.
Depending on the amount of air used in the
combustion of the sulphur or the roasting of the
pyrite, a gas rich in oxygen and poor in sulphur
dioxide or a gas with a lower oxygen content
and containing more sulphur dioxide can be
obtained.
It follows from
our considerations on
the
kinetics of this process
and on the internal
diffusion in the catalyst tablets that the maximum
production (Pmax' to be obtained by following
the optimum temperature curve) can be calculated
as:
Pmax = (V.)opt • Vcat • ex • (% 502)0
The optimum space velocity to be applied is
proportional to
VP8, (Pso)o
which reaches its maximum value at certain O2
and 502 percentages.

ponding values of these percentages, besides the
corresponding values of

8. CONSIDERATION OF THE TRENDS IN TECHNICAL
REACTION DESIGN
Finally, we shall examine some aspects of the
development of the technical oxidation process
relating to the points discussed in this paper.
"I'here are several ways of designing the con-
verters.
Three types of converters have been
known for a long time :
dioxide
content of the gas
and
by the gas
velocity, the apparatus according to Fig. 19a
appeared to be an improvement: In this apparatus
internal and external heat exchange arc combined.
When improvements in the roasting technique
made it possible to obtain cheap gases of high
sulphur dioxide content, a method of cooling by
supplying cold gases was soon invented (BACHE-
LARD, 1980, sec Fig. lOb). A parallel improvement
was the application of converters having 3 or 
56
P. MAns and D. W. VAN KnEIELEN : Oxidations carried out by means of vanadium oxide catalysts
instead of 2 stages, between which the gases are
cooled by means of heat exchangers.
Also, in
this
manner
a
better
approximation
to
the
optimum temperature curve can be
obtained
(Simon-Carves Monsanto).
One
of the latest
developments, the Chemico wet sulphuric acid
process, is carried out with a concentrated gas
(12% S02)' which makes it possible to apply
direct air cooling (Fig. 1ge).
Thus we see a trend in the converter design to
bring the temperature distribution in the con-
verters nearer to the optimum (i.e., as far as
economical considerations will allow). In the one
case this is attained by applying several converters
in series, in the other by direct cooling of the gases.
The effect of the size of the catalyst tablets
has been examined in the I.G. laboratories.
It
-appeared that reduction of the grain size, while
aiming at the same degree of conversion, made it
possible to increase the production capacity [20].
For this reason in the Lurgi convertor 6 mm dia,
cylinders arc applied in the first few catalyst
layers (which layers arc operated at the highest
temperatures).
In the technical oxidation of aromatic com-
pounds the fluid bed technique has come to play
an increasingly large part.
There is an important
advantage in the uniformity of the temperature
in a fluid bcd, which, together with the pos-
sibility of applying higher concentrations of the
organic compound, is a strong point in favour of
the application of a fluid bed.
It is obvious that this is not the case for the
S02 oxidation: owing to the homogeneity of the
temperature in a fluid bed a great number of
reactors would have to be arranged in series in
order that the optimum temperature course might
be better approximated. Thus, for this particular
case the fluid bed technique loses much of its
attractiveness.
