isolated in a trigonal-bipyramidal form with [ N i (  h e n )  ]  +  
as the 
counterion. The large counterion PPN+, i.e. [(Ph3P)2N]+, 
has 
also been widely used to crystallize organometallic and carbonyl 
anionic complexes, e.g. [PPN] 
[HFe(C0)4]. 
The volumes of many of the cations and anions that form the 
basis of Basolo's generalizations have been calculated and used 
to compute the volume ratios Va/Vc (a = anion, c = cation) 
summarized in Table 111. It appears from the calculated anion 
to cation volume ratios given in Table Ill that the stabilization 
of unusual anionic coordination compounds may be achieved if 
the volume of the cation is greater than or equal to that of the 
anion. For example, in the series [NMe4I2[NiCI4], 
[NEt,],- 
[NiCI4], and [Ph3AsMeI2[NiCI4] 
the volume of the cation in- 
creases by a factor of 3 relative to that of the anion. The largest 
anion/cation volume ratio for the salts isolated as solids and listed 
in Table Ill is 1 .IO, 
and the smallest is 0.16. Therefore, contrary 
to previous suggestions, it is not necessary to match the cation 
and anion sizes with any great precision in order to stabilize 
unusual coordination environments and the cation volume may 
exceed that of the anion by up to a factor of 6. However, an anion 
with an unusual coordination environment is not likely to be 
isolated if Vu/ 
V, greatly exceeds 1.0. For example, the calculated 
Vu/ 
V, ratios for Li2NiC14 
and K2NiCI4, 
which cannot be isolated, 
are 50 and 10, respectively. Therefore, optimum conditions for 
crystallization are achieved when the cation is approximately equal 
to or larger in volume than the anion. The analysis is thus con- 
sistent with McDaniel's concept of a lower critical cation volume, 
with the lower limit corresponding approximately to Basolo's size 
matching criterion. 
The precise matching of the sizes of the cations and anions in 
molecular salts is not a dominating consideration in crystallization, 
since ions with quite different volumes can pack efficiently within 
a crystal by varying their coordination numbers. This effect may 
be illustrated by reference to the series of [PF6]- salts with 
spherical cations, whose packing coefficients have been summa- 
rized in Table 1V. Although the volume ratio ( 
Va/Vc) varies from 
1.7 to 14.7, the packing efficiency within the unit cell calculated 
from the volumes given in Tables I and I1 and the literature unit 
cell volumes lies within the narrow range of 64.6-71.5%. It is 
apparent from Table 1V that this is achieved by varying the 
coordination numbers of the cations and anions. Although the 
ions chosen in the table have relatively spherical geometries, similar 
considerations apply to ions with less symmetrical geometries. 
These results have encouraged us to develop a set of "radius ratio 
rules" for interpreting the structures of molecular salts, and these 
results will be described in subsequent publications.",'2 
It is apparent from the results presented in this paper that the 
crystallization of salts using large countercations may be 
successful 
even when the VJV, ratio falls to ca. 0.20, because the structure 
in the solid state can achieve a close-packed arrangement by 
varying the coordination number. The size effect may play an 
important role in the isolation process, however, if the cation is 
highly polarizing and is capable of forming a binary compound 
with a high lattice energy. For example, Li+ salts of [MX,]" 
anions are thermodynamically unstable6 because of the high lattice 
( I  I )  Mingos, D. M. P.; Rohl, A. L. To be published.

energy associated with LiX. For molecular cations M+ with a 
volume greater than or equal to that of the anion, there is a 
significant contribution to the lattice energy from van der Waals 
forces and the thermodynamic driving force for forming M+X- 
is less critical. 
The variation in coordination number may not be important 
for characterizational purposes but could influence the magnetic, 
conductivity, and nonlinear optical properties of the compound 
significantly. 
The moments of inertia calculated for cations and anions provide 
objective criteria for evaluating their shape characteristics. For 
example, it is apparent from Table 111 that [dienH3I3+ 
is rather 
cylindrical in shape, whereas [Cr(NH3)6]3+ 
is effectively spherical. 
Therefore, although these counterions have similar volumes 
([dienH3I3+, 
108 A3, [Cr(NH3)6]3+, 
126 A3), 
only the chromium 
complex stabilizes the [CuCI5I3- ion. 
The complex [Pt(NH3)4] 
[CuC14] provides a particularly in- 
teresting example of size and shape matching. The volumes of 
the cation and anion are equal to within 1 A3, and their shape 
parameters are both indicative of discoidal geometries if the 
[CUCI]- 
ion adopts a square-planar geometry. In general, the 
packing efficiencies of discoidal molecules are greater than that 
of spherical molecules, which encourages the adoption of this 
geometry by [CuCI4l2-. 
The availability of the size and shape factors in Tables I and 
I1 should encourage the study of more systems where the coor- 
dination geometry is influenced by the shape of the cation. The 
complementary problem of stabilizing unusual cation geometries 
by selecting the appropriate counteranions could also be addressed 
using the data provided. It is noteworthy that currently there are 
few well-documented examples of this phenomenon.

First, you need to sequentially extract any quotes in the literature that are most relevant to each question, and print them in numbered order, separated by newlines. Quotes should be relatively brief. Do not attempt to summarize or answer questions at this stage, but simply repeat exactly what the corresponding part of the literature says.

Please enclose the full list of quotes in <quotes></quotes> XML tags. If there are no relevant quotes, write "No relevant quotes" instead.

Then, answer the question, starting with "Answer:".  Do not include or reference quoted content verbatim in the answer. Don't say "According to Quote [1]" when answering. Do not write reference number of quotes after answer. Put your answer to the user inside <EnglishVersionAnswer></EnglishVersionAnswer> XML tags. Output formatted text, with line breaks for each question.Separate quotes and answers with a blank line. Provide the answers to all questions in English. After completing the English answers, translate all those answers into Chinese and provide the Chinese version inside <ChineseVersionAnswer></ChineseVersionAnswer> XML tags.

Thus, the format of your overall response should look like what's shown between the <example></example> tags.  Make sure to follow the formatting and spacing exactly.
