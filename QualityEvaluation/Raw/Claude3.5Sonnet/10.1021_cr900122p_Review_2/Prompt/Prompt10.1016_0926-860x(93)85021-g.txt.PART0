Abstract 
The use of xeolites as catalysts for selective oxidation reactions has been considered. Particular 
attention has been paid to recent studies of a gas-phase oxidative hydroxylation of aromatics by dini- 
trogen monoxide. The best results were obtained for a simple reaction, the oxidation of benzene to 
phenol over Fe-containing ZSM-5 xeolites. It proceeds with nearly 100% 
selectivity at 25-30% benzene 
conversion. Further progress in this promising direction, the hydroxylation of aromatics, can provide 
new efficient technologies in organic synthesis. Peculiarities of dinitrogen monoxide as an oxidant and 
the reaction mechanism are discussed.

1. INTRODUCTION 
For a long time zeolites were not considered as promising catalysts for oxi- 
dation reactions although they have found a wide variety of applications in 
other fields of catalysis. Considerable changes occurred in the last decade due 
to the discovery of titanium silicalite with pentasil structure (TS-1) exhibiting 
unique catalytic properties in liquid phase oxidation with dihydrogen peroxide. 
TS-1 proved to be an effective catalyst for many reactions such as oxidation 
of alcohols, epoxydation of alkenes, hydroxylation of arenes, ammoximation 
of cyclohexanone [l-5]. 
The number of these reactions is still growing. Lately, 
information appeared concerning selective oxidation of low alkanes to alcohols 
over titanium zeolite [ 6-81. Some of these reactions were shown to proceed 
over other zeolites of the pentasil type [ 9,101. 
In recent reviews these results were considered as a great success in liquid 
phase organic synthesis [11-E], 
whereas the achievements in the gas-phase 
oxidation catalysis over zeolites seem to be rather modest. The transfer of the 
reaction into the gas phase may provide some technological benefits. However, 
in this case it is impossible to use H,O, as an oxidant due its spontaneous 
decomposition upon temperature increase. As to applying molecular oxygen, a 
conventional oxidant for gas-phase oxidation catalysis, there are no promising 
results yet. 
A new tendency in heterogeneous catalysis appeared in the 1980s. That is 
to employ as an oxidant not only a loose (molecular) oxygen but also combined 
in various oxygen-containing molecules [ 16-231. This development has been 
employed mostly for searching for new routes of catalytic activation of meth- 
ane and other low alkanes. Dinitrogen monoxide attracts the greatest attention 
among the non-traditional oxidants. Quite often the substitution of dioxygen 
for dinitrogen monoxide results in an increase in reaction selectivity, including 
oxidation reactions over zeolites [17,X3,23]. 
Properties of dinitrogen monoxide as an efficient oxygen donor have been 
highlighted in the study of such a delicate reaction as oxidative hydroxylation 
of the aromatic nucleus. The major results in this field have been published 
during the last 4-5 years. Though it is difficult to make a final conclusion at 
the current state of affairs, these results seem to be quite promising and pro- 
moting the development of new ecologically safe technologies for organic syn- 
thesis. Thus, we believe there are good reasons for attracting the attention of 
more researchers to this new field of oxidation catalysis. 
2. OXIDATION OVER ZEOLITES BY DIOXYGEN 
Before considering reactions with dinitrogen monoxide, we consider it useful 
to survey briefly the studies on oxidation reactions over zeolites with dioxygen. 
These reactions are usually performed over transition metal oxides [24]. 
G.I. Panov et al./Appl. Catal. A 98 (1993) l-20 
3 
Their catalytic activity is provided by a more or less easy electron transfer 
ensuring the possibility of the reversible change in metal oxidation state upon 
its interaction with dioxygen and an oxidized substance. Although zeolites 
themselves, are not supposed to function as active catalysts, their application 
as carriers might be of great interest. Their regular structure, high adsorption 
potential and some other properties may provide a variety of states of a sup- 
ported component. As is discussed in numerous studies [ 
25,261, different states 
of a metal introduced in a zeolite matrix can form: (i) an isolated ion in tetra- 
hedral lattice positions; (ii) an isolated ion outside the lattice but within the 
pore system serving as a counter-ion; (iii) small clusters and finely dispersed 
oxide particles either within the pore system or on the outer surface of zeolite 
crystals. Such a variety of states is hardly probable in the case of other systems 
and seems to provide good prospects in catalyzing oxidation reactions. 
Results of many investigations performed mostly in the 1970s (they are 
reviewed in detail in ref. 27) did not substantiate these expectations. Some 
authors demonstrated good catalytic properties of zeolites in a number of ox- 
idation reactions (e.g. ethylene epoxydation over Ag/CaX 
[ 
281, toluene am- 
moxidation over Cu/ZSM-5 
[ 
29]), but nevertheless, the efficiency of these 
zeolite catalysts was not as high as that of the best conventional catalysts. 
Qne of the reasons for the inferior catalytic properties is that transition 
metals lose their activity when introduced in a zeolite matrix (especially as 
isolated ions). The decrease of atomic catalytic activity in some cases can at- 
tain several orders of magnitude if compared to bulk oxides [ 27 
1. This is mainly 
due to the loss of their ability to activate dioxygen as was proved by O2 
isotopic 
exchange [30-321. Actually, O2 activation is the result of its dissociative ad- 
sorption on the catalyst surface requiring two neighbor sites and the transfer 
of four or at least two electrons from the surface to the oxygenmolecule [ 33,341. 
This can hardly occur in the case of small clusters and is even more unlikely 
in the case of isolated metal ions. 
Catalytic,properties vary depending on the zeolite structure and the coor- 
dination around the introduced metal [ 
35-391. Hydrocarbon oxidation reac- 
tions are often complicated by side processes on the acid sites of the zeolites, 
which lead to coke deposition and catalysts deactivation. 
All these circumstances resulted in a noticeable decrease of interest in the 
gas-phase oxidation over zeolites in the last decade. Inspection of proceedings 
of international conferences held during this period revealed only isolated pre- 
sentations related to this matter. 
This view of zeolites as unsuitable oxidation catalysts, based on the experi- 
ence with dioxygen, appear to be incorrect, when 0, is replaced by other donors 
of oxygen. Such substitution can result not only in changing the mechanism 
of oxidant activation, but also in generating new oxygen surface forms that 
may direct the reaction towards new pathways. This last fact in particular 
4

provides a surprising efficiency of zeolite catalysts in aromatics hydroxylation 
by dinitrogen monoxide, as will be shown later. 
3. HYDROXYLATION 
OF BENZENE OVER CONVENTIONAL CATALYSTS 
Tbe introduction of a hydroxyl group into an aromatic nucleus is one of the 
most difficult problems in the synthesis of fine organic chemicals and inter- 
mediates: phenols, naphthols, oxyamines, oxyacids, etc. Commercial hydrox- 
ylation processes are typically performed indirectly via multistage technolo- 
gies often requiring aggressive reagents [ 40,411. The simplest reaction of this 
type, conversion of benzene to phenol, is performed by means of the so-called 
cumene method consisting of three stages presented in Fig. 1. Alkylation of 
benxene with propene to produce cumene (stage 1) and decomposition of cu- 
mene hydroperoxide (stage 3) occur in the liquid phase in presence of acid 
catalysts. Although it is a well established technology, any reasonable alter- 
native to the cumene method is considered with great interest. 
The most radical solution of this problem attracting the attention of re- 
searchers is the introduction of a hydroxyl group via one-step direct oxidation 
of benzene to phenol, as is shown by a dashed arrow in the scheme (Fig. 1) . 
However, many attempts to accomplish this reaction with molecular oxygen 
have failed. The interaction with 0, is accompanied by destruction of the ar- 
omatic ring producing either maleic anhydride (over specially selected cata- 
lysts) or products of complete oxidation. 
Irll982 a new reaction was discovered by Iwamoto et al. [42,43]: benzene 
oxidation by dinitrogen monoxide: 
C,HI,+NPO-C6H50H+N2 
(I) 
This reaction allowed to achieve an essentially higher selectivity towards 
phenol. Supported oxides of vanadium, molybdenum and tungsten demon- 
stratied 
the best results. At 550C in the presence of 30% water vapor in the

gas flow, the vanadia catalyst provided a 71.5% selectivity towards phenol at 
10.6% benzene conversion. These results were welcome as a long desired one- 
step ecologically safe and commercially feasible process [ 44,451. Its forthcom- 
ing pilot testing in a fluidized bed has been reported. 
However, this process has not been commercialized, since the vanadia cat- 
alyst was proved not to be efficient enough. First of all, its selectivity towards 
phenol still was not sufficiently high due to a rather intensive side reaction, 
the complete oxidation of benzene. 
Selectivity is among the most important parameters for partial oxidation 
processes. It is even more important when dinitrogen monoxide is applied, 
since unlike 02, it is a rather expensive oxidant, its cost being comparable to 
that of benzene. One molecule of dinitrogen monoxide is needed to oxidize one 
molecule of benzene to phenol according to reaction (1)) but 15 molecules of 
dinitrogen monoxide are consumed per one benzene molecule in its complete 
oxidation via reaction (2 ) 
:

(2) 
Fig. 2 shows that a decrease in selectivity towards phenol due to this reaction 
causes not only an increase in benzene consumption but also a dramatic in- 
crease of dinitrogen monoxide consumption. Thus, at 70% selectivity the con- 
sumption of dinitrogen monoxide per one weight unit of phenol increases by 
almost B-fold if compared to that at 100% selectivity. Hence, the commercial- 
ization of the process is hardly expedient, when its selectivity is below 85-90%. 
Another undesired route for dinitrogen monoxide conversion may be pro- 
vided by its decomposition to elements. Fortunately, neither vanadium oxide 
nor zeolites catalyze this reaction under conditions of benzene oxidation, since 
no dioxygen evolution into the gas phase was registered.

4. SEARCH FOR NEW SYSTEMS; ZEOLITE CATALYSTS 
Results of Iwamoto et al. [ 42,431 stimulated further efforts in searching for 
more efficient catalytic systems. The reaction was proved to be rather sophis- 
ticated. Numerous compounds of different chemical compositions were tested. 
Some of them tested by our group are presented in Table 1. Many attempts to 
imprbve vanadia catalysts resulted in considerable enhancement of their sta- 
bility [ 461. However, other important parameters of the catalyst failed to be 
imprbved if compared to ref. 43, though various modifying additives and prep- 
aratibn procedures as well as different sources of oxygen ( 
02, NzO, NO, SO,) 
wereiused. Other oxides and metals presented in Table 1 either demonstrated 
no activity or catalyzed the complete oxidation of benzene, which is typical for 
the metals of the platinum group. Only few catalysts provided small amounts 
of phenol, this, however, is not noteworthy. 
Results obtained over zeolites were rather unexpected. Table 2 shows cata- 
lytic properties of some zeolites tested under conditions similar to those for 
vanadia catalysts. A considerable amount of phenol was obtained in several 
cases. Especially interesting results were observed over AlPO, and ZSM-5 
zeolites. 
Apparently, other laboratories tested numerous catalysts as well. As a result, 
in 1988 three teams of researchers [ 
47-491 have found independently ZSM-5

to be promising catalytic systems for benzene oxidation to phenol by 
dinitrogen monoxide. These catalysts allowed the reaction to proceed within a 
300-400C temperature range without water addition into the reaction mix- 
ture. Moreover, they provided a very high selectivity towards phenol. Though 
the maximum yield of phenol in these studies was reported to be only &15%, 
ZSM-5 zeolites appeared to be rather promising for developing new efficient 
catalysts. Later, this was proved by quite a few patents reporting far better 
results including some other hydroxylation reactions performed over these cat- 
alysts [ 
50-551. 
5. NATURE OF CATALYTIC ACTIVITY OF ZEOLITES; ROLE OF IRON 
The mentioned results raised a number of fundamental questions. First, what 
is the particular property making zeolite function as an active catalyst? ZSM- 
5 zeolites are well known as efficient catalysts for various acid type reactions, 
but it seems rather unlikely for the zeolite aluminosilicate matrix to catalyze 
such a delicate reaction as oxidation of benzene to phenol. According to ref. 
56, some redos reactions are catalyzed by alkaline or alkaline earth metals 
present in zeolites, but in the case of benzene oxidation all authors emphasize 
the importance of acidification of ZSM-5 zeolite. As Fig. 3 shows, the replace- 
ment of sodium ions by protons actually causes a remarkable increase in initial 
activity, though it is gradually lost due to coke deposition. The selectivity of 
the reaction does not change, being close to 100% 
in all the cases. (The values 
of benzene conversion and selectivity towards phenol are usually reported

without accounting for coke deposition. In most cases the latter is not detect- 
able from the material balance of carbon based on chromatographic data. ) 
This activity is likely to be ensured by admixtures of transition metals ne- 
glected in the first studies. Iron seemed to be the most common impurity, which 
is added mainly along with the starting ingredients at the step of zeolite syn- 
thesis. To investigate the role of iron, the authors [57] have synthesized a set 
of zeolite samples with ZSM-5 structure and the same mole ratio SiOz/ 
Alz03 = 100, but with various Fe content from 0.004 to 0.72 wt.-% of Fe,O,. 
These samples with ferrialuminosilicate (Fe-Al-Si) composition are referred 
to as Fe (Al) -N, where N is the number corresponding to the weight percentage 
content of Fe,O,. 
Fig. 4 shows benzene conversion as a function of iron content in Fe-Al-Si 
samtiles 
plotted with the data of ref. 57. In fact, the samples Fe (Al) -0.004 and 
Fe (Al)-0.007 containing an extremely small amount of Fe (0.004 and 0.007 
wt.-%, correspondingly) exhibit a very low activity. As iron content grows up 
to ca. 0.1 wt.-% of Fe,O,, benzene conversion increases considerably and then 
reaches a plateau with minor subsequent changes. Within the plateau region 
conversion attains 10% at 300C with 100% selectivity towards phenol. At 
350 IC 
benzene conversion is 25% with the selectivity of 95% or higher for the 
best samples. Further temperature increase provides a decrease in the selectiv- 
ity. This happens mainly due to intensification of successive phenol oxidation, 
which results mostly in carbon dioxide and water production. Benzoquinone,

catechol, hydroquinone, dibenzophurane, cresol are observed among the prod- 
ucts, too. 
Catalytic activities of other metals have been studied as well. The tests on 
ZSM-5 zeolites containing Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn, Pd or Pt introduced 
either at the stage of the synthesis [ 571 or via ion exchange [ 
471 have shown 
the metals to be inactive in oxidation of benzene to phenol. 
Thus, iron introduced into a zeolite might be one of a few particular elements 
or even the only one which can efficiently catalyze this reaction. This issue is 
worth of further investigations. There may be a similarity between the mech- 
anism of catalytic performance of iron in Fe-ZSM-5 and that combined in 
cytochrome P450 as well as in some model systems mimicking mono-oxyge- 
nesis: all of them catalyze oxidative hydroxylation of hydrocarbons, including 
oxidation of benzene to phenol, with high selectivity [ 
581. 
6. ROLE OF CHEMICAL COMPOSITION 
OF ZEOLITE MATRIX 
In the previous section we have seen a determining role of iron incorporated 
in Al-Si matrix. But iron-containing samples with ZSM-5 zeolite structure can 
be synthesized on an Fe-Si base only without aluminium. The comparison of 
these two systems, Fe-Al-Si and Fe-Si, could allow one to elucidate the influ- 
ence of the chemical composition of zeolite matrix on catalytic properties of 
iron, 
introduced. 
For this purpose a set of ZSM-5 samples of Fe-Si composition with a low 
aluminium content (0.01-0.03 wt.-% A1203 as impurity) was prepared [59]. 
Iron, concentrations in these samples varied from 0.003 to 4.8 wt.-% of Fe203. 
Formula Fe-N designates the samples of this system, where N is a percentage 
of Fe,O,. Fig. 5 shows the iron content to have a profound effect on the activity 
of tbe Fe-Si system in the oxidation of benzene to phenol. Hence, the reaction

rate over Fe-O.003 containing 0.003 wt.-% Fez03 (silicalite) is hardly detecta- 
ble at 5OOC, while in the case of samples containing 2 wt.-% FeZO, or more 
the conversion of benzene attains 25% at 350 C. 
Though the curves in Figs. 4 and 5 are rather similar, a lo-fold difference in 
their abscissa scales can be noticed. To observe the whole picture of the influ- 
ence of iron in the Fe-Si and Fe-Al-Si systems, the data in Fig. 6 are presented 
on logarithmic scales. The individual dependencies of the catalytic activities 
on iron concentration in these systems are significantly different. Thus, in 
order to achieve the same benzene conversion, Fe-Si samples need an iron 
content lo-30 times higher than Fe-Al-Si. And, vice versa, in some cases the 
activity of the ahnninium-containing samples is by an order of magnitude higher 
if compared to Fe-Si samples of the same iron content. 
Such an effect of ahrminium permits to assume that, beside iron atoms, al- 
G.Z. Panov et al. 
jApp1. Catal. A 98 (1993) l-20 
11 
uminium atoms may participate in the formation of the active sites. This sug- 
gestion has been analyzed elsewhere [ 321, when considering the similar influ- 
ence of iron on catalytic activity of Fe-ZSM-5 in dinitrogen monoxide 
decomposition. The direct comparison of the number of active sites (which 
can be reliably measured in these systems [ 31,60,61] ) to the number of alu- 
minium atoms contaminating Fe-Si samples did not support this suggestion. 
According to ref. 32, the presence of aluminium does not effect the composition 
and properties of iron-containing active sites but increases their concentration 
due to a more favourable distribution of iron in the zeolite matrix. 
Accounting for the important role of the zeolite matrix, it would be of inter- 
est to extend the studies via introducing iron in matrices with other chemical 
composition, first of all, in matrices of metal-silicate analogs of ZSM-5 con- 
taining B, Ga, Ti, etc. 
7. SPECIFIC FEATURES OF DINITROGEN MONOXIDE AS AN OXIDANT; 
MECHANISM OF HYDROXYLATION 
Considering the mechanism of benzene hydroxylation one should take into 
account first of all an exciting peculiarity of dinitrogen monoxide as an oxi- 
dant. Its specificity is apparent from Table 3, when data obtained with dini- 
trogen monoxide and oxygen over typical samples with Fe-Si and Fe-Al-Si 
composition are compared. A dramatic decrease in the activity is observed upon 
the substitution of dinitrogen monoxide by oxygen. Thus, benzene conversion 
of 2527% 
in the presence of dinitrogen monoxide drops down to 3.3% over 
Fe-2:.1 
sample and to zero over Fe (Al) -0.08 sample in the presence of oxygen. 
Note, in particular, that a perfect change of the reaction route occurs upon the 
oxidant substitution. While in the presence of dinitrogen monoxide phenol 
forms with a 96-99% selectivity, only products of full oxidation are registered 
in tbe presence of dioxygen. 
Such a crucial importance of an oxidant nature was assumed to relate to the 
changes of the surface oxygen state. This assumption stimulated studies of the

mechanism of dinitrogen monoxide decomposition over Fe-ZSM-5 zeolites and 
their ferrisilicate analogs [ 31,32,60,61], since this particular reaction supplies 
oxygen to the catalyst surface. These studies have revealed active sites (re- 
ferred to as a-sites) of a specific affinity towards dinitrogen monoxide. Decom- 
position of dinitrogen monoxide on these sites is followed by generation of a 
new surface oxygen form (a-form). 
Properties of cw-oxygen were studied in a number of papers [31,32,60-641 
and were shown to be as follows: 
1. It is formed on Fe-ZSM-5 zeolites and not on Fe,O, or other iron-contain- 
ing catalysts tested. 
2. It is loosely bonded to the surface, the value of the bond energy being 
anomalously low. 
3. It is thermally stable up to 300 C; above this point it desorbs irreversibly 
into the gas phase. 
4. It is produced upon dinitrogen monoxide decomposition but not upon ox- 
ygen adsorption. 
5. It exhibits high reactivity: at room temperature it is involved in oxygen 
isotopic exchange as well as in oxidation of carbon monoxide and methane. 
The a-form of oxygen was compared to the well studied surface radicals O- 
and 0; 
[60,61]. In its reactivity, a-oxygen is close to O- species [65-671, 
though there are differences in some other properties that prevent these two 
forms from being identified. According to ref. 34, the a-form should be classi- 
fied as an electrophilic state of surface oxygen. 
Referring to ref. 59, the ability to produce the a-form of the surface oxygen 
is the main specific peculiarity of dinitrogen monoxide as an oxidant. Here is 
a mechanism of benzene oxidation in which a-oxygen plays the key role: 
1. N,O+( 
)-N2+(0) 
2. 
C&H,+ (O)-_(C,H,OH) 
3. 
(C,H,OH)=C,H,OH+ 
( 
) 
No phenol formation occurs over the catalysts incapable to provide a-oxygen. 
This is supported both by the negative results obtained for ZSM-5 zeolites 
containing metals other than iron and by many unsuccessful attempts (un- 
dertaken at our group in collaboration with Prof. O.P. Krivoruchko and E.V. 
Skripchenko) to synthesize active catalysts by introducing iron into various 
non-zeolite matrices (SiOz, A1203, 
TiOa, MgO, ZnO ). Neither the a-form nor 
phenol formation were observed in all the cases. 
The rate of dinitrogen monoxide decomposition and the concentration of 
active cw-sites 
appeared to be proportional to each other and described by a 
function common for all the samples of Fe-Si and Fe-Al-Si systems [ 321. If the 
mechanism of benzene oxidation (stages l-3 ) is correct, a similar dependence

should be observed for this reaction also. If we depict benzene conversion as 
depending not on the iron concentration (that is the case in Fig. 6) but on 
conaentration of a-sites in Fe-Si and Fe-Al-Si samples, C,, this is indeed so 
(Fig. 7). Unlike dinitrogen monoxide decomposition, this curve attains a pla- 
teau at high concentration of the active sites due to the inhibiting effect of the 
reaction product - 
phenol [ 
591. Starting from the definite value of C, this 
effect nearly compensates the increasing number of the sites. 
The quantum chemical model of active sites and the interpretation of (Y- 
oxygen on Fe-ZSM-5 are given elsewhere [ 681. 
8. HYDROXYLATION 
OF BENZENE DERIVATIVES 
According to the published data the best zeolite catalysts for benzene oxi- 
dation with dinitrogen monoxide provide a 95100% selectivity towards phenol 
at 25-30% benzene conversion. These results seem to be rather modest in com- 
parison to some conventional processes of the gas-phase oxidation. (For ex- 
ample, for the oxidation of acroleine to acrilic acid [69] or of methanol to 
formaldehyde [70] over oxide catalysts, the yield of the desired products 
( Y= S-X) attains 95-97% ) 
. However, nowadays the cumene process for phenol 
production consists of three stages, the conversion degree not exceeding 20- 
30% at each stage. Considering this, the mentioned results of benzene oxida- 
tion with dinitrogen monoxide are rather attractive. 
From the prices listed in Table 4 one can estimate the expenses for the raw 
materials required by the new process to be equal to ca. 60% of the phenol cost. 
This might ensure the process to be competitive with the cumene one. But the 
real consumptions of raws are to be somewhat higher if compared to the the- 
oretical ones due to the side processes. They are mainly: the subsequent oxi-

dation of phenol and the formation of coke on the catalyst surface. The latter 
deactivates the catalyst and, thus, a periodic catalyst regeneration by heating 
in an oxidizing atmosphere is required. The intensity of the coke formation 
seems to depend essentially on the reaction conditions and chemical compo- 
sition of the catalyst used. As was reported for ferrisilicate analogs of ZSM-5 
zeolite [59], 5-15% of the quantity of benzene involved in the oxidation re- 
action is consumed for coke formation. 
Beside benzene consumption, coke formation is followed by the consump- 
tion of dinitrogen monoxide as well. Even if no side product is detected in the 
gas phase, the selectivity of dinitrogen monoxide conversion to phenol does 
not attain 100% and stays at the level of 75-80%. That means, that 20-25% of 
the consumed dinitrogen monoxide is converted into products associated with 
coke formation. Side conversion of an oxidant seems to be typical for the re- 
actions of this type and all efforts to overcome this problem are worth doing. 
Note that in the process of phenol hydroxylation in the liquid phase the selec- 
tivity of hydrogen peroxide conversion is equal to 50-70% [ 
31. 
Up to now, almost no attention has been paid to the mechanism of coke 
formation and to the related problem of the stability of the catalysts used in 
hydroxylation reactions with dinitrogen monoxide. This problem should be 
studied more thoroughly in the future, since it may considerably effect the 
commercial feasibility of the new method. 
From the practical point of view it is very important to know whether this 
new method can be employed for the synthesis of more complicated products. 
The costs of substituted phenols are much higher if compared to phenol (Table 
4) and the emenses for dinitrogen monoxide consumed are of no great impor- 
tance in this case. 
Theoretically there are two ways to synthesize the substituted phenols. They 
differ (Fig. 8) by the sequence of the introduction of the functional groups. 
Since the existing hydroxylation methods are of low efficiency, the pathway 
(I ) is used predominantly nowadays, i.e. the hydroxylation step is performed 
first and then the second desired group is introduced via phenol alkylation, 
halogenation, nitration, etc. [ 46,471. The latter processes often proceed with 
a low selectivity, need many stages of distillation, and do not ensure high yield

of the desired products. Therefore, the development of new and improved 
methods for hydroxylation of aromatic nuclei is necessary which would not 
affect other functional groups and would provide a high efficiency of pathway 
(II). 
Till now the hydroxylation of benzene derivatives using dinitrogen monox- 
ide has not been studied enough but there is no doubt anymore about the fea- 
sibility of this reaction. Table 5 presents the data for the oxidative hydroxy-

lation of halogenobenzenes, toluene and phenol. Note that the hydroxylation 
by dinitrogen monoxide can be performed with aromatic nuclei containing a 
deactivating substitute such as a fluorine or chlorine atom. As far as we know, 
this is not so in the case of liquid phase hydroxylation with peroxides. 
The oxidation of halogenobenzenes and toluene results in the formation of 
all three stereo isomers, whereas the oxidation of phenol yields only orto- and 
par&-isomers, i.e. catechol and hydroquinone (benzoquinone ) 
. Different dis- 
tributions of isomers can be provided by the different nature of oxidizable sub- 
stances and by some differences in chemical composition of catalysts not dis- 
closed in patents. 
9. CONCLUSION 
Early attempts undertaken in the 1960-70s to use zeolites in oxidation ca- 
talysis have not provided promising results. One of the main reasons was that 
a transition metal introduced in a zeolite matrix lost its ability to activate 
molecular dioxygen. Even in the most successful cases the catalytic perform- 
ances of metalzeolites were inferior to the best conventional catalysts. 
The situation changed remarkably during the last decade. Two factors seem 
to favour the changes: 
(i) synthesis of high silica zeolites of the pentasil type and their metal sili- 
cate analogs; 
(ii) application of chemically bound oxygen combined in various molecules 
as an oxidant. 
Hydrogen peroxide and dinitrogen monoxide proved to be the most efficient 
oxidants. The results of the liquid phase oxidation by hydrogen peroxide over 
titanium silicalite are well known. They promoted several new methods for 
performing oxidation reactions. 
In this review we have tried to draw attention to the recent advances in gas- 
phase oxidation catalysis over zeolites using dinitrogen monoxide. The best 
results were obtained in the direct oxidation of benzene to phenol over Fe- 
ZSM-5 zeolites and their ferrisilicate analogs. The unique performance of these 
catalytic systems is related to the specific form of surface oxygen generated 
upon dinitrogen monoxide decomposition. Because of its simplicity, high se- 
lectivity and easy regeneration of the used catalyst, this ecologically safe method 
may attract attention of phenol manufacturers. 
This way of hydroxylation seems to be particularly promising if applied in 
the synthesis of aromatic compounds with several functional groups. Studies 
upon reactions of this type are at the very initial point now. Isolated data on 
benzene derivatives show that hydroxylation of more complex molecules pro- 
ceeds not as smoothly as in the case of benzene and with a somewhat lower 
selectivity. More intensive coke deposition should also be expected, though this 
point is not specified in the patents.

Performing catalytic processes in the gas phase is known to have some tech- 
nological advantages over that in the liquid phase, but when complex molecules 
are involved, which is typical for the syntheses of fine chemicals and inter- 
mediates, these advantages may disappear due to thermal unstability of these 
molecules and their difficult desorption from the catalyst surface [71-731. 
These complications should be taken into account when the prospects of gas- 
phase oxidative hydroxylation are estimated. Nevertheless, the possibility to 
use dinitrogen monoxide (an abundant, safe and cheap oxidant if compared to 
those used in the liquid phase) may make this method attractive. Another 
particular advantage of dinitrogen monoxide is that even for aromatics with 
electron withdrawing substitutes (Fe, Cl, etc.) it does not prevent the hydrox- 
ylation of the nucleus. 
Feasibility of industrial implementation 
of oxidative hydroxylation by din- 
itrogen monoxide will depend on further progress in studying the reactions of 
this type. There is no doubt that the present results can be improved owing to 
elaborated methods for modifying zeolites. These methods provide a fine ad- 
justment of the important parameters of zeolites such as chemical composition 
of their internal and external surfaces, acidity, pore opening, shape selectivity, 
stability and so on [Z&27,74-78]. They have not been taken into account 
earlier to optimize catalysts for hydroxylation with dinitrogen monoxide. 
It seems to be of importance to expand catalytic studies towards other types 
of zeslites and microporous materials [ 
26,79,80]. Their number grows rapidly 
due to successes in inorganic synthetic chemistry. Further investigations can 
considerably improve this promising method for hydroxylation of aromatics 
and hopefully will extend it to other types of substances.
