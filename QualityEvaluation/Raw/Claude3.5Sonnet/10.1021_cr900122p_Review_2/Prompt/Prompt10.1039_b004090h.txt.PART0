The adsorption of methane on Zn-exchanged zeolites was studied theoretically by density functional theory
(DFT). Diverse types of active sites were employed, such as: a Zn(II) cation, which was placed on dierent rings
(4T and 5T), a ZnO (in a tetramer conguration) cluster and a [ZnOZn]2 dimer complex. The Zn(II) cation
is the most exposed to probe molecules when situated on the 4T ring of zeolites. In this position, the cation

larger rings. The assignment of the band shifts found in the experimental IR spectra of methane adsorption,
which were associated with the cation position in the zeolite framework, had to be revised following the results
for the calculated shifts. Larger shifts are associated with the cationic position at small rings. Methane prefers
to adsorb physically in a 3-fold conguration on Zn(II) at both 4T and 5T rings. This is not the case for ZnO
and [ZnOZn]2 sites, in which the dissociative adsorption is more favorable. In the last two cases, the
dissociation is in good agreement with the alkyl path, described previously in the literature. The
[ZnOZn]2 site appears to be one of the active forms of the Zn cation on zeolites with a low Si/Al ratio.

calculated here were found for 3-fold physisorption on ZnO and Zn(II) (4T ring), as well as in dissociative
adsorption on the [ZnOZn]2 site. None of these models, however, could describe this large experimental
shift. The same results were also observed when these systems were embedded in a solvent cage, which
mimicked the framework environment around the active site.

Introduction
Zeolite catalysts are extensively used in petroleum rening, as
well as in the petrochemical and chemical industries. In many
industrial processes, zeolites are employed as an acid catalyst.
Recently, a number of new processes have been developed,
which are based on metal-loaded zeolites. Aromatization of
alkanes, which is well addressed in the literature,1h4 is an
example of an economically important reaction. Ga and Zn
zeolites have been used to promote this reaction and shown to
exhibit a very high activity.1,4
Several studies have been performed to understand the
catalytic eect of these active sites.2,3,5h7 The adsorption of
small molecules in combination with vibrational spectroscopy
has been widely used to provide information on the adsorp-
tion mechanism.8h18 Methane has been used as an alternative
probe for cationic forms of zeolite,11,15,19 since it has a low
adsorption affinity and is very similar to the hydrocarbon
molecules involved in the aromatization reaction. Neverthe-
less, it is still unclear how the cation, at a certain position
inside the zeolite, interacts with the probe molecules and inu-
ences the activity of the catalyst.

Methods
In this work, dierent cluster fragments were used to model
the zeolite framework: 4T ring, 5T and 8T ring.
Various active sites for Zn cation exchanged in zeolites were
also studied for the molecular and dissociative adsorption of
methane: [ZnOZn]2 and Zn2, and the ZnO cluster,
which was modelled under the
cubic structure. The
(ZnO)4
rst two sites were always employed in combination with the
zeolite framework models. The ZnO, however, was used
without direct interaction with the zeolite framework, due to
computational costs.
H-termination of the Si group was chosen instead of OH-
termination
to

such
as

hydrogen-bond formation, which results in the creation of a
non-acceptable model.20 Clusters provide qualitatively inter-
esting results for the local interaction between the active site
and the probe molecule. The use of such clusters has been
extensively discussed elsewhere.21h23
All the calculations were performed using the Los Alamos
basis set. This basis set consists of D95-Dunning/Huzinaga
full double-f for the rst row (for: C, H and O)24 and Los
Alamos ECP plus double-f for NaBi atoms (for: Zn, Si and
Al).25h27 The choice of these basis sets was made to save com-
putational time and to allow the use of extended models for

frequency calculations. To verify the accuracy of the present
calculations, the physisorption energy of methane on the 4T
ring (for both 3- and 1-fold congurations) and the corre-
sponding frequencies were calculated using the following basis
sets: triple-f for the oxygen and Zn atoms plus polarization
functions, D95-Dunning/Huzinaga full double-f plus polariza-
tion functions for Al, Si, C and H. This test showed that both
calculations are fully comparable, as already indicated in a
similar study.18
The DFT method was used because it includes some elec-
tron correlation and scales much better than the MP2
method.28 The hybrid B3LYP functional was used, since it
gives acceptable values for molecular energies and geome-
tries.29h31 Furthermore, B3LYP has also recently been used
to
study

donation,32
and
weak
and

H-bonds,33h35 with reliable results.
An additional test was performed; the physisorption energy
of methane (3-fold conguration) on the 4T ring, and the
corresponding frequencies were calculated using the MP2
method (Los Alamos basis set). No signicant dierence was
observed for both B3LYP and MP2 results. The hybrid
B3LYP functional was used in this work as implemented in
GAUSSIAN 98 code.36
Parallel calculations were also performed using the self-
consistent reaction eld method (SCRF) with the Onsager
reaction eld method37 to mimic a zeolite environment. The
solute occupies a xed spherical cavity of radius
within the
a0
solvent eld, which is determined by using the keyword
Volume in the GAUSSIAN 98 package.36 A dipole in the
molecule will induce a dipole in the medium, and the electric
eld applied by the solvent will in turn interact with the
molecular dipole, leading to net stabilization.38 This method,
although the simplest SCRF model type, can describe the
eect of the zeolite framework on the ZnO cluster (deposited
in the micropores of the zeolite) and on both the Zn(II) ion
and (ZnOZn)2 active sites, which substitute the protons on
the original protonic zeolite. This methodology of embedding
the model on a solvent cage has been successfully used in
several previous studies,35,39h42 and in a recent study of
zeolite models.43
No symmetry constraints were used for most of the congu-
rations studied, the exceptions being the 8T ring and 5T
models. The 8T ring model was calculated in the following
manner: the dangling hydrogen atoms, which represent the
oxygen atoms from the zeolite framework, were xed in the
X-ray position of the oxygen atoms as found for mordenite
zeolite.44 For the 5T model, a full optimization predicted a
non-realistic geometry for the dissociative adsorption of
methane on the Zn2 site; therefore, some constraints were
also needed to prevent the related problem. The constraints
were used to keep the ring shape of the cluster; the distance
between Si(2) and Si(3), and the dihedral angle between Si(2),
Al(1), Si(3) and Al(2), were xed as they were found in the
optimized geometry of the Zn(II) 5T model (see Fig. 1).
All the stationary points were veried by frequency calcu-
lations. These tests produce no imaginary frequencies, which is
required for a local minimum.45 The exceptions were the 8T
ring and 5T models, in which some imaginary frequencies
were found due to the imposed constraints.
All frequencies used for this study were scaled by 0.96, as
suggested previously by Curtiss et al.31 and Scott and
Radom.46 The B3LYP functional has been indicated as the
best functional among others47 but anharmonicity corrections
have to be taken into account. Although GAUSSIAN 9836
evaluates only the harmonic vibration frequencies, the com-
parison of such values with experimental results proved very
useful to analyze the induced changes in the IR spectra of the
adsorbed probe molecules, for instance in the study of
methane interaction with alkaline-earth cations exchanged in
zeolites.18

Results and discussion
The results will be divided into two parts. In the rst part, the
interaction of methane on two dierent Zn2 cation positions
is analyzed based on the methane adsorption energy; then, the
calculated IR spectra are compared with the experimental
data available in the literature. In the second part, the strong
shift, which was observed experimentally, in the symmetric
stretching mode of methane adsorption on Zn/HZSM-5 is
discussed.
3.1
Interaction of methane with Zn(II) sites
Two dierent positions of Zn2 were calculated using the 4T
ring and 5T models. The rst model represents the cation
position in the four-membered ring, which is found in several
zeolites, for instance faujasites and zeolite A. This position
corresponds to the
and
sites in these zeolites. The

second model represents the cation position in the ve-
membered ring, which is found in ferrierite and ZSM-5.
The zinc cation is out of the plane of the oxygen atoms in
the 4T ring model (see Fig. 1), as has already been men-
tioned in several studies.2,5,7,49 The cation sits in a tetra-
coordinated conguration, in which the ZnO distance is
2.07 A
 .
In the 5T model, a dierent trend is observed: the Zn(II)
cation sits in the same plane as the oxygen atoms. Although

the 5T model does not have a bridge oxygen atom between
Si(2) and Si(3) atoms (see Fig. 1), the zinc cation sits in the
same position compared with the real 5T ring model, as
calculated in the work of Shubin et al.5,6 (see Table 1). This
structural position for the cation was also described by other
workers
for
six-membered
rings.5,19,50
This
is
possible
because large rings have more exibility than the rigid four-
membered ring, and therefore can better accommodate the
distortions on the TOT angles.19 In this case, the ZnO
bond has two dierent lengths: 1.98 and 2.12 A
 .
The dierence in the structural position has a direct eect
on the interaction between the Zn cation and the methane
molecule (see Table 1 for distances and Table 2 for adsorption
energies). It is not surprising that methane has a weak inter-
action with Zn(II) in the ve- or six-membered ring position,
since the Zn(II) is less exposed to probe molecules than on the
4T ring position. Shubin et al.5 had already predicted such
behavior, when they studied the stability of Zn(II) on the 4T
ring and 5T ring positions, evaluating the necessary
energy to reduce the cation to the metal on these positions.
Based on the work of Frash and van Santen,2 the alkyl
dissociation of methane on Zn(II) was also investigated (see
Fig. 1 for 4T ring model). Interestingly, methane prefers to
physisorb instead of to dissociate on these sites (see Table 2).
Both zeolite models predict an endothermic reaction for this
dissociation reaction; therefore, this dissociation may occur at
high temperature. Kustov and Kazansky10 have already
demonstrated a similar behavior for the
molecule, which

does not dissociate on Zn/Y zeolite at room temperature.
3.1.1
Eect of distinct cationic position on the IR spectra of
methane adsorbed on Zn(II) sites. Experimentally, the inter-
action of methane with these dierent positions is described
by the shifts of the IR peaks of the methane adsorption
spectra.10,13,14,17 A symmetric stretching band of methane
at 2914 cm1, which is IR-forbidden in free molecules,
(l1)
becomes activated due to interaction with the zeolite and
exhibits a red shift. The other important band is from the IR-
active degenerate antisymmetric stretching vibration (l3),
which is observed in the gas phase at 3020 cm1. This band
also becomes shifted to lower wavenumbers.18
In Table 3, one can nd the experimental IR frequencies for
methane adsorption on dierent zeolites together with the cal-
culated frequencies for methane adsorption on both sites (4T
ring and 5T). The
frequency appears shifted down by 38
l1
cm1 when methane is interacting with the 4T ring. The
same large shift is veried for the
band. On the other hand,
l3
the calculated shifts are not so pronounced (*l1 \ [10
cm1), when methane is adsorbed on the other type of zeolite
site (5T). Therefore, one can conclude that the larger the
shifts, the more exposed the cation.

gurations encountered here.

split into two resolved bands with shifts of 20 and 40 cm1,
respectively. More recently, Cohen de Lara indicated that the
orientation of the methane molecule corresponds to a tripod
conguration, which is not completely perfect.52 For both
sites studied here, these results are in good agreement, see
Table 3.
Milot and Jansen55,56 studied theoretically the isotope
eect in the scattering of methane from a at surface including
nine internal vibrations. They concluded that the 3-fold con-
guration is mostly responsible for the isotope eect in
methane dissociation and the symmetric stretching mode (l1)
will give the highest enhancement of the dissociation probabil-
ity of methane. This agrees with the results encountered here.
Methane at the 3-fold position, which is the optimized struc-
ture, will probably follow the alkyl path for methane disso-
ciation by stretching symmetrically all CH bonds.

Ogino et al.15,57 studied the adsorption of methane in dif-
ferent cationic zeolites (Li, Na, K, Rb, Cs)/ZSM5. That work
showed that the larger shift in the
stretching frequency cor-
l1
responds to the following sequence of cationic zeolites:
Li [ Na [ K [ Rb B Cs. This means that Li disturbs the
methane molecule more than the other cations studied,
cations, which is understandable, since the polarizing power of
a cation is inversely proportional to its ionic radius.58 Analo-
gously, one can extend this idea to the case of dierent
cationic positions with respect to the zeolite framework. The
oxygen atoms of the zeolite framework can screen the cation
charge, decreasing the cation polarizing power. This screening
eect will depend on the interaction between the cation and
the oxygen atoms, in other words, on the spatial arrangement
of these atoms. Of course, the main consequence will be the
cationic inuence on the IR vibration modes of the probe mol-
ecule.11 This eect is exemplied by the dierent results found
for the calculated IR frequencies of the methane vibrations
obtained from the dierent cationic positions studied in this
work (see Table 3).
Kazansky et al. have contributed to the understanding of
the adsorption of small probe molecules on cationic zeolites
with several dierent studies.9h14 In two recent papers, molec-

Interaction of the methane molecule with dierent models
of Zn(II) sites
Kazansky et al.9,12h14 have shown that both hydrogen and
methane IR spectra demonstrated strong perturbation of their
symmetric stretching vibration mode, when adsorbed on Zn-
containing ZSM5. This perturbation is about [109 cm1 for
methane on 3ZnO/HZSM5 zeolites.9 Such a large shift is not
found in the same zeolite type with dierent exchanged mono-
valent cations10,11,13 or even for other divalent cations.11
Some models have been proposed to describe how Zn(II) is
introduced
into
ZSM5,
such
as
Zn(II)3,7,68
or
as
Zn(OH).49,69,70 In both cases, Zn(II) replaces two protons in
the neighboring aluminumoxygen tetrahedron. Biscardi et
al.3 proposed the formation of [ZnOZn]2 species as an
alternative model for Zn(II) on zeolites. This type of system
has also been suggested for other divalent cations such as Fe
and Cu ions.71h73
In the previous part, the calculated shift for the
stretch-
l1
ing frequency mode was, at maximum, equal to 38 cm1. This
shift is still far from the experimental values found in the liter-
ature.9,12h14 This indicates that such a shift can only be pro-
duced by a dierent type of site, which has a strong
interaction with the probe molecule. Kazansky et al.14 pro-
posed recently that such shifts can be assigned to methane

with
nanometre-sized
ZnO
microparticles
in
ZSM5. The interaction with a
cluster is reported here.
(ZnO)4
A
cluster has an exposed Zn(II) cation (see Fig. 2),
(ZnO)4
which interacts strongly with methane. Interestingly, the Zn(II)
in the four-ring position interacts with the methane molecule
in a similar way to the
cluster (see Table 2). The ZnO
(ZnO)4
bond length and the distance between methane and the Zn
cation are also in good agreement (see Table 1). This indicates
that an exposed Zn atom, either as an edge of the ZnO surface
or a Zn(II) cation sitting on the 4T ring, has a high reactivity.
Unlike the Zn(II) cation in the four ring, methane prefers,
however, to be dissociated in the
clusters (see Table 2).
(ZnO)4
The dierence between the physisorption and dissociative
adsorption energy is about 90 kJ mol1.
With respect to the calculated shift for the
mode of both
l1
types of adsorption (see Table 3), the largest value corre-
sponds to physisorption, in which
is found to be [34
*l1
cm1. This shift is comparable to the previous value found for
the Zn(II) cation sitting on the 4T ring model, thus conrm-
ing the similarity between both sites.
For dissociative adsorption (see Fig. 2), the calculated shift
for the same frequency mode was very small (*l1 \ [9
cm1). It is comparable to the shift encountered in the 5T
Zn(II) model. Therefore, one may conclude that dissociative
adsorption
on
nanometre-sized
particles
is
not
(ZnO)4
responsible for the large shift in the
mode of methane
l1
adsorption on ZSM5.
The stability of the nanometre-sized ZnO microparticles
was also calculated by comparing the energy required to form
the Zn(II) sites, at the 5T ring position, starting from ZnO.

model.
To calculate this energy, the reaction of ZnO particles with
the
sites was studied. The ZnO particles were model-
Brnsted
led by three dierent structures: monomer, dimer and tetra-
mer. The reaction was slightly endothermic when the tetramer
was used as reactant but it became highly exothermic when
the small clusters were used (see Table 4 for all structures).
This situation changes if the [ZnOZn]2 site is formed
instead of the Zn(II) site. The reaction is exothermic even when
the tetramer is used as reactant. The same trend for the reac-
tion energy values is observed when small models are used
(see Table 4). Therefore, the stability of the nanometre-sized
ZnO microparticles seems to be highly dependent on two dif-
ferent factors: the structure of the particles and the avail-
ability of
sites in the zeolite channels.
Brnsted
The [ZnOZn]2 site was employed in the calculations
together with the 5T model (see Fig. 3). This model rep-
resents the ve-membered ring or part of the ten-membered
ring of ZSM5. Shubin et al.6 also used this active site for cal-
culations but between two dierent 5T rings of ZSM5.

Fig. 3
Methane adsorption and dissociation on [ZnOZn]2 dimer species.
The optimized structure is very symmetrical; therefore, it
was decided to verify this result by increasing the size of the
model up to an eight-membered ring cluster. This ring was
used to save computational time and also represented fairly
well all the possible local distortions that a large ring can
suer, when interacting with the [ZnOZn]2 site. Some
constraints, which were mentioned in the Methods section,
had to be applied to prevent unrealistic results. In this situ-
ation the [ZnOZn]2 site remains symmetrical, as in the
small model (see Fig. 3).
This site does not have an exposed Zn(II) cation; therefore,
one could expect lower shifts for the physisorbed methane.
Interestingly, the methane molecule does not fully occupy the
same 3-fold position as in the previous adsorption congu-
rations. The hydrogen atom of methane interacts with the
oxygen atom of the [ZnOZn]2 site (see Fig. 3). The l1
mode shift is slightly larger than the shift observed in the
5T Zn(II) model,
cm1 (see Table 3). The
*l1 \ [19
adsorption energy, and ZnC and ZnO distances are similar
to the values found for the 5T Zn(II) model (see Tables 2
and 1, respectively). This indicates that both sites have weak
interaction with the methane molecule.
IR studies of methane adsorbed on a MgO surface51
showed interesting results; there are two dierent shifts for the
stretching frequency: [14 and [24 cm1. These shifts
l1
were assigned to one of two dierent forms of methane
adsorption: species III, in which methane is adsorbed inter-
acting with both the Mg cation and oxygen anion. The
methane physisorption on the [ZnOZn]2 site can have a
similar conguration to that proposed in the species III site.
The shifts are also in good agreement (see Table 3); therefore,
the shift of [14 cm1 may be assigned to this species. On the
other hand, the large shift may be assigned to some existing
defects on the surface, in which Mg2 is exposed, resembling
the results of (ZnO)4 .
The dissociative adsorption of methane was also studied
using the [ZnOZn]2 model. This dissociation is an exo-
thermic reaction but not as exothermic as calculated for this
reaction on
clusters. Interestingly, the dissociation also
(ZnO)4
follows the alkyl pathway, which forms the methyl car-
banion. The other dissociative process, which forms the carbe-
nium ion for methane activation, is not favorable as indicated
previously by Frash and van Santen2 for ethane dissociation
on Zn(II) zeolites.
The nal geometry of the dissociative complex is shown in
Fig. 3. Yoshizawa et al.74 studied theoretically the reaction of
methane to give methanol on FeZSM5 zeolite. Initially,
methane forms a g2 complex with the Fe, then one of the
hydrogen atoms of the methane is abstracted by the a-
oxygen atom, leading to OH and
groups. Although the
CH3
Fe cation is a dierent active site, this result is very similar to
the dissociation conguration found here for the [ZnO
Zn]2 site.
The value for the ZnC bond length on the [ZnOZn]2
site is longer than that found for the dissociated methane in
clusters (see Table 1). This is because the methyl group
(ZnO)4
interacts with both Zn cations. The resulting geometry is
again very symmetric. The validity of this symmetric arrange-
ment was tested. The position of the Al atom was changed
and one more
group was added (6T model). These modi-
SiH3
cations broke the original symmetry of the system (the disso-
ciative complex of methane on the [ZnOZn]2 site plus the
zeolite cluster). Interestingly, the optimized geometry is again
symmetric; the [ZnOZn]2 site prefers to be in the sym-
metric conguration in both the 6T and 8T ring models,
regardless of the initial asymmetric position of the system, see
Fig. 3.
On evaluating the
red shift in this dissociative adsorp-
l1
tion, one can nd that it has also the largest shift together
with that found for Zn(II) on the 4T ring and
sites.
(ZnO)4
Thermodynamically, the dissociative adsorption of methane
on the [ZnOZn]2 site is about 20 kJ mol1 more favor-
able than physisorption (see Table 2).

Dierent adsorption congurations of the methane
molecule adsorbed to Zn(II) sites. In addition to the 3-fold
position, two dierent physisorption congurations were
tested, in which the methane molecule interacts with the active
site in a 1-fold position, also a
symmetry; the CH group
C3v
interacts with (a) the oxygen atom and (b) the Zn cation of the
active site, see Fig. 4. Since the minimum of the potential
surface is the 3-fold conguration, these stationary points
were obtained by decreasing the default convergence criteria
in the Gaussian package.36 In the calculations performed here,

Co-adsorption of an extra methane molecule on (ZnO)4
cluster and [ZnOZn]2 species.
the methane molecule was free from any external interaction
in those optimizations.
For case (a), only the
and [ZnOZn]2 sites were
(ZnO)4
used. The 4T ring describes an unrealistic situation, in which
the methane molecule sits far away from the Zn cation. The
latter case does not agree either with the more favorable dis-
sociation path for methane: the alkyl path, as described by
previous models. These 1-fold congurations were optimized
and found to be minima of the potential surface for both the
[ZnOZn]2
and
sites.
The
energy
dierence
(ZnO)4
between the 3- and 1-fold congurations is about 2.7 and
[7.3 kJ mol1 for [ZnOZn]2 and
respectively.

For the [ZnOZn]2 site there is no large energy dierence
between the 3- and 1-fold congurations. The distance CSi(1)
in the 1-fold conguration, however, is 7.43
(see Table 5),

which is larger than the diameter of the ZSM5 pores:

the 3-fold conguration is more likely to be formed in ZSM5
than the 1-fold conguration. An opposite trend is veried for
the
case, in which the energy dierence is largely in
(ZnO)4
favor of the 3-fold conguration. The
shift found in both
*l1
cases was of the same magnitude as that found using the
3-fold conguration (see Table 5).
For case (b), Ferrari et al.18 have already studied this con-
guration (by frequency calculations) as a transition state,
which connects two equivalent 3-fold complexes. In the
present case, a similar situation occurs; the 1-fold congu-
ration is a saddle point for all three dierent models: the
4T ring and [ZnOZn]2 models. This congu-
(ZnO)4 ,
ration may, however, be found as a ground state conguration
if the methane molecule is conned at a special position in the
channel. The
shift found for this conguration was also
*l1
not as large as that calculated using the 3-fold conguration
(see Table 5). Moreover, this conguration does not agree
with the more favorable pathway for methane dissociation, as
seen before.
3.2.2
The eect of the co-adsorption of another methane
molecule on the methane adsorption IR spectra. The co-
adsorption of two methane molecules has been studied on the
and [ZnOZn]2 sites. The 4T ring model was
(ZnO)4
not used because it describes an unrealistic situation for the
second methane molecule, as shown previously. For the
model the chosen conguration has both methane
(ZnO)4
molecules occupying the most stable situation: 3-fold on
Zn(II) cations, see Fig. 5. The IR frequency calculations
showed that this co-adsorption does not change the
or

shifts, see Table 5.

For the [ZnOZn]2 site, the second methane molecule

species (see Fig. 5).

Although the second methane molecule disturbs the disso-
ciated one, the new calculated shifts for the
band are not
l1
strongly changed, see Table 5.
3.2.3
The eect of the zeolite framework on the methane
adsorption IR spectra. It seems reasonable to assume that
methane can interact simultaneously with the cationic site and
the framework oxygen atoms. Ferrari et al.18 examined such a
possibility by interacting methane from one side with the
cation and from the opposite side with one water molecule,
which represented the oxygen center. The methane congu-
ration used was the 3-fold conguration. The new
red shift
l1
was [30 cm1, which corresponded to a
of [24 cm1
**l1
from the original shift. Even combining this
change with
**l1
our values, the observed experimental shift is still larger.
Since molecules adsorbed inside the cavities are subjected to
electrostatic, as well as van der Waals interactions, some site
models were embedded in a solvent cavity with dierent

relative permittivities (e). The IR spectra will depend then on
the orientation of the molecule with respect to the surface or
adsorption site, and the electric eld direction.52 The mol-
ecules, being closer to the cavity surface, should feel a strong
inducing eld, and thus the forbidden bands become more
activated.8,75
The self-consistent reaction eld (SCRF) method with the
Onsager reaction eld method37 was used to mimic a zeolite
environment, as was described previously. An e value of 2.5
was used initially, as suggested recently for H/ZSM5 zeolite
by Zygmunt et al.43 and in other previous work.76 Dierent
values, such as 5.0, which is the observed and calculated value
for a-quartz,77 and 10.0 were also used. The latter value rep-
resents the strong perturbation oered by the framework
oxygen atom and the cation on large connement of the
methane molecule.
The rst case studied was methane physisorbed on the
site. Although methane prefers to be dissociated in this
(ZnO)4
site, it may be possible that this reaction becomes energetically
unfavorable by geometric constraints on the zeolite frame-
work. The dissociative adsorption of methane in the (ZnO)4

signicantly the dipole of the molecule.38

Conclusions
The adsorption of methane on Zn-exchanged zeolites has been
studied theoretically by DFT. Diverse types of active sites
have been employed, such as: a Zn(II) cation on dierent rings
(4T and 5T), a ZnO (in a tetramer conguration) cluster and a
[ZnOZn]2 dimer species.
The Zn(II) cation is most exposed to probe molecules when
sitting on the 4T ring of zeolites. In this position, the cation
activates strongly both the forbidden symmetric stretching IR
band
and the observed asymmetric stretching IR band
l1
l3 .
This activation is not observed when the cation is placed in
larger rings, for instance a 5T ring. A similar eect is also
found for the adsorption energy of methane, calculated for
these cationic positions.
The assignment of the band shifts found in the experimental
IR spectra of methane adsorption, which were associated with
the cation position in the zeolite framework, had to be revised
following the results for the calculated shifts. Larger shifts are
associated with the cationic position at small rings.
Methane prefers to adsorb physically in a 3-fold congu-
ration on Zn(II) at both 4T and 5T rings. This is not the case
for ZnO and [ZnOZn]2 sites, on which dissociative
adsorption is more favorable. In the last two cases, this disso-
ciation is in good agreement with the alkyl path, described
previously in the literature.
The [ZnOZn]2 site appears to be one of the active
forms of the Zn cation on zeolites with a low Si/Al ratio. This
site is more thermodynamically stable than both 5T and

decompose into Zn(II) or [ZnOZn]2. Owing to its size, this
oxide cluster may only be stable in special positions inside the
pores.
Dierent adsorption congurations and methane loadings
have been tested in order to understand the large shift
observed experimentally by Kazansky et al.9,12h14 for the l1
band of methane ([109 cm1). The largest shifts calculated
here were found for 3-fold physisorption on ZnO and Zn(II)
(4T ring) and dissociative adsorption on the [ZnOZn]2
site. None of these models, however, could describe this large
experimental shift. The same results were also observed when
these systems were embedded in a solvent cage, which mim-
icked the zeolitic environment around the active site.
