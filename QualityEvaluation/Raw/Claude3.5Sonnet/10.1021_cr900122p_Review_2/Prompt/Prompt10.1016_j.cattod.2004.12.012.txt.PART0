Abstract
An overview is given on extensive studies, which are targeted to involve N2O into organic synthesis as an oxidant. Due to unique oxidative
properties, nitrous oxide provides remarkable prospects in catalytic and non-catalytic oxidation chemistry in both gas and liquid phases. The
interest to new oxidant resulted in appearance of a new technology for the production of inexpensive N2O too.

1. Introduction
The involvement of new feed stocks and reagents into
large-scale chemical industry is always a very important
event for the industry and its economics and often results in
dramatic consequences. It was the case, e.g., when coal, a
main feed stock for the industrial organic synthesis in the
19th century, had been substituted by oil in the 20th century.
The same is expected for the further substitution of oil by
natural
gas
(light
alkanes)
in
the
21st
century.
In
petrochemistry of the 20th century, an extremely important
consequence of the mentioned changes in the feed stock
basis had resulted from the substitution of extremely reactive
but dangerous acetylene and its derivates, which were
produced in the past mainly from the coal, by olefins.
For sophisticated synthesis, which includes partial
oxidation of various organic substrates, one can recognize
utilization initially of air oxygen, then a set of inorganic
compounds like transition metal ions in a high oxidation
state, then the substitution of these oxidants by a green
chemistry oxidant hydrogen peroxide.
Indeed, the final choice of real chemical industry is
basing not only on chemical properties of a particular
reagent but also (and often mainly) on comparative
assessments of its cost, availability, etc.
One of the most difficult fields of catalytic chemistry is
selective oxidation of hydrocarbons. The main difficulty
here consists in the creation of selective catalysts. Such
catalysts should perform a dual function: to activate
dioxygen and generate some catalyst-bound oxygen species
of a proper reactivity, and to activate organic molecule so as
to direct the reaction to the desired products [1,2]. The
optimization of both these parameters simultaneously is a
very difficult task, since one cannot tune them indepen-
dently. Modifying the catalyst composition, we often find
ourselves in the situation when gaining in one aspect we are
losing in the others. That is why for many catalytic oxidation
reactions we fail to get a reasonable selectivity. Instead, we
have to use complex multi-step processes.
Two simple reactions of the above type are the partial
oxidation of methane to methanol and that of benzene to
phenol. These reactions are often included into the top 10
most difficult challenges of modern chemistry. At present, to
produce methanol, methane is first converted to a mixture of
H2 and CO and after that the latter mixture is converted to
methanol. As to the benzene oxidation to phenol, it is carried
usually via the three-step cumene process leading to
acetone as byproduct. Theoretically, the both selective
oxidations could be done in a single step, simply adding one
oxygen atom to the starting molecule.

Application of alternative oxidants in the form of various
oxygen-containing molecules opens new possibilities. The
idea of this approach is as follows. Variation of the oxidant
chemistry should change the state of surface oxygen, while
the activation of organic molecules may remain unchanged
or affected to a smaller degree, thus providing new
opportunity for controlling the selectivity.
During the last decades, one of the most intriguing new
reagents for the selective oxidation has appeared to be
nitrous oxide, N2O. This compound is used in medicine due
to its light narcotic effect (laughing gas) but in chemistry
it was considered mostly as a not very toxic but practically
useless compound. Moreover, in the last two decades even
some special environmental restrictions were issued to
prevent the emission of N2O into the atmosphere, since the
compound has been recognized as a both greenhouse and
ozone depleting agent.
Our brief review is devoted to nitrous oxide as an oxidant,
which remarkable oxidation chemistry promises a signifi-
cant progress in the field. The paper includes four parts
comprising the following subjects: a gas phase catalytic
oxidation with nitrous oxide, a liquid phase non-catalytic
oxidation with nitrous oxide, the development of a pilot-
scale process for direct oxidation of benzene to phenol
(AlphOxTM), and the production of N2O via catalytic
selective oxidation of ammonia with dioxygen.
2. Gas phase catalytic oxidation with N2O
In the late 1970searly 1980s, nitrous oxide has attracted
a significant attention of researchers involved in searching
for new ways in selective transformation of methane. In
particular, research groups of Lunsford [3,4] and Somorjai
[5,6] showed that application of N2O oxidant over supported
MoO3 and V2O5 oxides provided high selectivity of methane
oxidation to methanol and formaldehyde, especially at low
conversions.
First practical interest to nitrous oxide as an oxidant has
appeared in relation to phenol problem, which is one of the
most bulky chemicals, with the annual world production
exceeding 6 million tons. Its present-day cumene technology
includes three steps: (i) alkylation of benzene with propylene
to produce cumene; (ii) oxidation of the cumene to cumene
hydroperoxide; and (iii) decomposition of the latter to the
target product phenol and a co-product acetone. An ideal
solution of the problem would be, indeed, a direct oxidation
of benzene to phenol with dioxygen:
(1)
However, many attempts to accomplish this reaction were
unsuccessful. The interaction with O2 in the presence of
known catalysts leads mainly to the destruction of the
aromatic ring and low phenol selectivity.
In 1983, Iwamoto et al. [7] were the first to use N2O for
the oxidation of benzene:
(2)
This reaction over a vanadia catalyst allowed achieving
much better selectivity as compared to the oxidation by
dioxygen. At 550 8C, the reaction selectivity exceeded 70%.
These results were recognized as a promising lead to a long
awaited one-step direct process. However, a pilot test
performance did not meet the expectations since the
selectivity proved to be too low for a commercial
development.
Nevertheless, work [7] has stimulated further efforts in
searching for new more effective catalytic systems. As a
result,
in
1988,
three
groups
of
researchers
[810]
independently distinguished the ZSM-5 zeolites to be the
best catalysts for reaction (2). The catalysts allowed the
reaction to proceed at much lower temperature and, which is
even more important, with the selectivity approaching
100%. Further studies involved the active participation of
many
other
groups
[1133]
and
contributed
to
the
improvement of the zeolite catalyst performance. Also, this
approach was expanded to the oxidation of various benzene
derivatives [3439] as well as other type of hydrocarbons
[20,4045].
On this basis, a new phenol process has been developed
jointly by Solutia Inc. (formerly a chemical business of
Monsanto separated in 1997) and the Boreskov Institute of
Catalysis (BIC). Below this process will be discussed in
more details. The remarkable oxidation activity of ZSM-5
gave rise to numerous discussions concerning the origin of
the mentioned untypical zeolite activity as well as the
reasons for an amazing specificity of the N2O oxidant
compared to O2.
As for the nature of the catalytic activity, two different
approaches were suggested. One of them is based on a
traditional notion that zeolites are the acidic catalysts with
strong Bro
nsted and Lewis sites. The other one relates to the
common oxidation catalysis, which might be provided by
the presence of a transition metal admixture. After many
efforts, this catalytic admixture has been identified and
proved to be iron [4649], which is present practically
always in zeolites at least at the level of a few hundred ppm
[50]. In the micropore space of the high silica zeolite matrix,
iron can form some active sites, which catalyze the reaction
and were called a-sites. Recently, several groups of
researchers [5053] conducted most conclusive studies on
this subject, including preparation of virtually Fe-free
zeolites, which is a quite difficult task. Presently, one may
conclude that the iron idea seems to be generally accepted,
although the detailed structure and composition of a-sites
till now are not perfectly clear and thus are the subject of
many theoretical [5460] and experimental [58,6169]
studies.

Fig. 1 shows a possible mechanism of the a-site
formation as it is suggested in [70]. An initial binuclear
iron complex (I) may form via both a Fe atom migration
from tetrahedral positions of the zeolite lattice or an
external Fe insertion from FeCl3 (e.g., at a solid ion
exchange, sublimation, CVD, etc.). The existence of such
complexes inside Fe-containing zeolites of various structure
including FeZSM-5, Fe-silicalite and Fe-b was suggested
and well documented by many authors [61,7181]. Upon
oxygen desorption at elevated temperatures, complex (I)
may transform into a reduced complex (II) (step 1). This
transformation seems to proceed rather readily. If this
oxygen evolution appears to be reversible, the a-site
formation does not occur and, at cooling, the system returns
to its initial state, thus restoring complex (I). Such
reversibility of the iron redox transformation was noted in
several works with FeZSM-5 zeolites, especially with those
having a high concentration of iron (15 wt.%) [62,73
75,80]. For the a-site formation to occur, the reduced Fe2+
atoms should convert into a new stable state, in which they
lose their ability to react with O2 and thus make the step (1)
irreversible. The process of the Fe2+ stabilization appeared
to depend on the chemical composition of the matrix and is
strongly facilitated
by the
presence of water
vapor
[20,26,30,71,78]. Presumably, the stabilization can occur
in the form of complex (III), in which Fe2
2
entities are
strongly incorporated into a silicate fragment of the zeolite
matrix and have a more distant position as compared to
complex (II), thus making impossible their reoxidation into
the latter complex.
The reduced iron atoms of complex (III) appear to be
inert to dioxygen. However, they are readily oxidized at
elevated temperatures (over 200 8C) by nitrous oxide into
complex (IV) to give adsorbed O
a species. Namely, this
reversible redox transition Fe2
a $ Fe3
a between complexes
(III) and (IV) is considered to provide a selective transfer of
oxygen atoms from N2O to hydrocarbon molecules to be
oxidized.
2.1. N2O specificity
A remarkable specificity of N2O is proved to relate to a
particular state of anion radical oxygen species O
a (called
a-oxygen), which forms on the a-sites from N2O, but
cannot form from O2 as it is illustrated by Fig. 1. A number
of thorough studies were devoted to investigation of
properties of a-oxygen including its reactivity tests, IR-
spectroscopy isotope labeling, and step-response experi-
ments [53,58,64,6669,8185]. Among the specific fea-
tures of a-oxygen, its very high reactivity seems to be the
most remarkable one. For example, it easily oxidizes
various organic molecules, including methane, even at
room temperature. This allows one to conduct a single turn-
over synthesis of, e.g., phenol according to the following
scheme [82]:
N2O   a
!
200250 COa  N2;
(3)
C6H6  Oa
!
25 CC6H5OHa;
(4)
C6H5OHa
!
25 C
extractionC6H5OH   a;
(5)
This scheme includes first the a-oxygen loading (Eq. (3)).
Then, after the reactor cooling, the a-oxygen interaction
with benzene is allowed at room temperature (Eq. (4)). The
phenol product can be finally extracted from the catalyst
surface, e.g., with methanol (Eq. (5)). In all experiments of
this type, the extract analysis revealed nearly the theoretical
yield of phenol. No other products were detected. These
results approve clearly the a-oxygen participation, which is
further confirmed by using the 18Oa isotope [45,82].
The Eqs. (3)(5) seem to be the main steps of the reaction
mechanism at the benzene oxidation with N2O.
The similar reactions can be conducted with other organic
substrates too. These single turn-over reactions, beside a
mechanistic importance, happened to be a convenient way
for estimating the potentialities of the oxidation with a-
oxygen. For that, a variety of organic substrates were tested
for their interaction with a-oxygen at room temperature to
identify primary oxidation products [84,85]. The list of
investigated substrates includes alkanes,
cycloalkanes,
alkenes and aromatics (Table 1). The analysis of the
products extracted from the catalyst surface showed that the
interaction with Oa in all cases leads to the selective
formation of hydroxylated products, thus revealing a
remarkable N2O potential as a selective oxidant.

2.2. Other catalytic reactions at elevated temperatures
Presently, many researchers are trying to use N2O for
conducting various oxidation reactions by the catalytic way
at elevated temperature. Quite good selectivities were
achieved in the oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes
[40,42,43] and in the epoxidation of propylene to propylene
oxide [86]. The data presented in Table 2 demonstrate the
selectivities toward hydroxylation products obtained in the
oxidation of various substrates over zeolite catalysts. One
can see that with alkane and alkene substrates, nearly no
hydroxylated products were obtained. Two exceptions are
works by Bulanek et al. [42] and Wood et al. [58]. In [42],
the selectivity of ca. 11.5% has been reported in the
hydroxylation of propane to propanol. In [58], even the
catalytic hydroxylation of methane to methanol has been
observed but the selectivity was only 2%.
The situation with aromatics is much more promising. In
some cases, the selectivities are high, over 90%. This is the
case for the hydroxylation of chlorobenzene, fluorobenzene,
phenol and biphenyl. However, in many cases the resulted
selectivity appeared to be much lower than it might be
expected from the room temperature stoichiometric data.
One can assume that this is a result of side transformations
taking place inside zeolite cavities when performing
catalysis at elevated temperatures. To suppress such side
transformations and especially coking, leading to a heavy
problem of the catalyst deactivation, the researchers are
trying to neutralize various functional groups on the zeolite
surface but leaving intact the a-sites. This is a difficult
challenge. Nevertheless, in some cases this approach leads to
significant improvements, which can be illustrated by an
example of hydroxylation of phenol to dihydroxybenzenes.
2.3. Hydroxylation of phenol
Fig. 2 shows a 40-h run for the hydroxylation of phenol
by N2O over the FeZSM-5 zeolite [87]:
(6)
The total selectivity of the reaction to the sum of
dihydroxybenzenes (DHB) is 95%. The upper picture
presents the distribution of the DHB isomers versus time
on stream. One can see that the fractions of resorcinol (RS)
and benzoquinone (BQ) are always small, while hydro-
quinone (HQ) and catechol (CH) are the two main products
subjected to a redistribution with the time-on-stream. At the
initial period, the HQ fraction comprises 85 mol%, and
