[1] "In general, in propane ODH catalysts made of Voxide supported on silica are more selective than those made with the alumina support, and the latter are more selective than those supported on titania, mainly because of the lower extent of parallel propane combustion, especially at low vanadia loading"

[2] "The reduction and catalytic properties of active VOx domains can be significantly affected by the formation of binary dispersed structures. For example, VOx-CrOx and VOx-MoOx mixed structures lead to a higher propane ODH rate and selectivity than VOx domains present at similar surface densities on pure Al2O3 supports"

[3] "The activation of the ethane CH bond proceeds through the formation of alkoxides, which decompose to ethylene and a surface OH group or are oxidized to surface-bound oxygenates (acetaldehyde)."

[4] "A key factor in the design of efficient catalysts for alkane ODH is the isolation of active sites. Therefore, the isomorphous substitution of active metal species, e.g., vanadium, into microporous and mesoporous materials is an attractive strategy for designing new catalysts for this reaction"

[5] "In the case of VCoAPO-18, the presence of both acid sites (related to the presence of Co2+ cations) and redox sites (related to the presence of V5+/4+ and Co3+/2+) seems to be an important factor in achieving high selectivities to ethylene during the ODH of ethane"

The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations in processes like oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH):

1. Support material: Vanadium oxide catalysts supported on silica are generally more selective than those on alumina or titania for propane ODH, due to lower parallel combustion reactions.

2. Binary dispersed structures: Mixing VOx with other oxides like CrOx or MoOx can improve propane ODH rates and selectivity compared to pure VOx on Al2O3.

3. Reaction mechanism: For ethane ODH, the C-H bond activation occurs through alkoxide formation, which then decomposes to ethylene or oxidizes to oxygenates.

4. Site isolation: Incorporating active metal species like vanadium into microporous or mesoporous materials can improve catalyst efficiency by isolating active sites.

5. Dual functionality: In some catalysts like VCoAPO-18, the presence of both acid sites (from Co2+) and redox sites (from V5+/4+ and Co3+/2+) contributes to high ethylene selectivity in ethane ODH.

These factors contribute to the industrial significance of these catalysts by improving selectivity, activity, and yield in alkane transformation processes. However, further optimization is still needed to achieve commercially viable performance levels for ODH reactions.

金属基催化剂的组成、结构和反应条件对烷烃转化过程(如氧化脱氢(ODH))的机理和效率有显著影响:

1. 载体材料:在丙烷ODH反应中,负载在二氧化硅上的钒氧化物催化剂通常比负载在氧化铝或二氧化钛上的更具选择性,这是由于平行燃烧反应较少。

2. 二元分散结构:将VOx与CrOx或MoOx等其他氧化物混合,可以提高丙烷ODH的反应速率和选择性,相比于纯VOx/Al2O3催化剂。

3. 反应机理:对于乙烷ODH,C-H键的活化是通过形成烷氧基进行的,随后分解成乙烯或氧化成含氧化合物。

4. 位点隔离:将钒等活性金属物种掺入微孔或介孔材料中,可以通过隔离活性位点来提高催化剂效率。

5. 双功能性:在某些催化剂(如VCoAPO-18)中,酸性位点(来自Co2+)和氧化还原位点(来自V5+/4+和Co3+/2+)的共同存在有助于在乙烷ODH反应中获得高乙烯选择性。

这些因素通过提高烷烃转化过程的选择性、活性和产率,增强了这些催化剂的工业重要性。然而,要达到商业可行的ODH反应性能水平,仍需进一步优化。
