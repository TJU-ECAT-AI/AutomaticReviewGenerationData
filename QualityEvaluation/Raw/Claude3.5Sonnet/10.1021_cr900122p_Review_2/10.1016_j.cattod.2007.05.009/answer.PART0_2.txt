[1] "In propane ODH, the catalytic activity of vanadium oxide catalysts increases with the V2O5 loading, while rates per V-atom reach a maximum on VOx domains of intermediate size, providing a balance between the activity of surface VOx species and their accessibility to reactants."

[2] "The selectivity to the corresponding olefins shows a peak for intermediate values of active phase loading, which corresponds to the development of the monolayer structure."

[3] "Isolated sites are beneficial for propylene selectivity, but they do not completely cover the support surface, on which the hydrocarbons can be adsorbed and further oxidized to COx."

[4] "For both propane and ethane, reactivity data for catalysts made of supported vanadium oxide are consistent both with kinetically relevant steps involving the dissociation of CH bonds (methylenic C atom in propane) and with a Mars-van Krevelen redox mechanism involving lattice oxygen in CH bond activation."

[5] "The role of the support on the reactivity of vanadium oxide in alkane ODH has been investigated by many authors [...] In general, in propane ODH catalysts made of Voxide supported on silica are more selective than those made with the alumina support, and the latter are more selective than those supported on titania"

[6] "The isomorphous substitution of active metal species, e.g., vanadium, into microporous and mesoporous materials is an attractive strategy for designing new catalysts for this reaction"

[7] "One of the best performing catalysts in propane ODH is the VOx-SBA-15 system, prepared by an alcoholic impregnation method, in which the introduction of V species onto the inner walls of SBA-15 provides a system with a large concentration of accessible, isolated and structurally well-defined active sites."

The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations in processes like oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH):

1. Catalyst composition: Vanadium oxide loading affects activity and selectivity. Intermediate loadings often provide optimal performance by balancing activity and accessibility of active sites.

2. Structure: The development of monolayer structures and isolated sites can enhance selectivity. Supported vanadium oxides follow a Mars-van Krevelen redox mechanism involving lattice oxygen in C-H bond activation.

3. Support effects: The choice of support (e.g., silica, alumina, titania) influences selectivity and activity. Silica-supported catalysts are generally more selective than alumina-supported ones for propane ODH.

4. Novel structures: Isomorphous substitution of active metals into microporous and mesoporous materials is a promising strategy for designing new catalysts with isolated active sites.

5. Reaction conditions: Factors like temperature and reactant ratios affect the oxidation state and activity of the catalyst.

6. High-performance systems: VOx-SBA-15 is noted as one of the best-performing catalysts for propane ODH, offering a high concentration of accessible, isolated, and well-defined active sites.

These factors contribute to the industrial significance of metal-based catalysts by allowing fine-tuning of catalyst properties to optimize yield, selectivity, and efficiency in alkane transformation processes.

金属基催化剂的组成、结构和反应条件显著影响烷烃转化过程(如氧化脱氢(ODH))的机理和效率：

1. 催化剂组成：钒氧化物负载量影响活性和选择性。中等负载量通常能提供最佳性能，平衡活性位点的活性和可及性。

2. 结构：单层结构和孤立位点的发展可以提高选择性。负载型钒氧化物遵循Mars-van Krevelen氧化还原机理，涉及晶格氧参与C-H键活化。

3. 载体效应：载体的选择(如二氧化硅、氧化铝、二氧化钛)影响选择性和活性。在丙烷ODH反应中，二氧化硅负载的催化剂通常比氧化铝负载的更具选择性。

4. 新型结构：将活性金属同晶取代到微孔和介孔材料中是设计具有孤立活性位点的新催化剂的有前景策略。

5. 反应条件：温度和反应物比例等因素影响催化剂的氧化态和活性。

6. 高性能系统：VOx-SBA-15被认为是丙烷ODH最佳催化剂之一，提供高浓度的可及、孤立和结构明确的活性位点。

这些因素通过允许精细调节催化剂性能以优化烷烃转化过程中的产率、选择性和效率，从而促进了金属基催化剂的工业重要性。
