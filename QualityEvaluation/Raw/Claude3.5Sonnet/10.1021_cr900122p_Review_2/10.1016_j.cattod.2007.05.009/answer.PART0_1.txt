[1] "In general, in propane ODH catalysts made of Voxide supported on silica are more selective than those made with the alumina support, and the latter are more selective than those supported on titania, mainly because of the lower extent of parallel propane combustion, especially at low vanadia loading"

[2] "The selectivity to propylene can be also correlated with thework functionvalues which decrease in the series: VWTi > VTi > VFe-Ti > VAlTi > VCaTi"

[3] "The isomorphous substitution of active metal species, e.g., vanadium, into microporous and mesoporous materials is an attractive strategy for designing new catalysts for this reaction"

[4] "In the case of VCoAPO-18, the presence of both acid sites (related to the presence of Co2+ cations) and redox sites (related to the presence of V5+/4+ and Co3+/2+) seems to be an important factor in achieving high selectivities to ethylene during the ODH of ethane"

[5] "In alumina-supported samples, alumina contributes to the primary deep oxidation and dehydrogenation routes of ethane to COx and coke respectively, which proceed effectively over the acidic centers. The molybdena phase is involved in the ODH of ethane and the secondary overoxidation of ethylene to COx"

[6] "Catalysts giving outstanding performance are those based on NiO oxide (NiO-Al2O3, Ni/Nb/O and NiO-MgO), and mixed molybdates (Mo/V/Sb/O, Mo/V/Nb/O and Mo/V/Te/Nb/O)"

The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations in oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) and zeolite-catalyzed reactions:

1. Support material: The choice of support affects selectivity in propane ODH. Silica-supported vanadium oxide catalysts are generally more selective than alumina-supported ones, which in turn are more selective than titania-supported catalysts. This is primarily due to differences in the extent of parallel propane combustion.

2. Metal composition: The combination of metals in the catalyst impacts performance. For example, in VCoAPO-18, the presence of both acid sites (from Co2+) and redox sites (from V5+/4+ and Co3+/2+) is crucial for high ethylene selectivity in ethane ODH.

3. Electronic properties: The work function of the catalyst surface correlates with propylene selectivity. Lower work function values generally lead to higher selectivity.

4. Metal dispersion and isolation: Isomorphous substitution of active metal species (e.g., vanadium) into microporous and mesoporous materials is an effective strategy for designing new ODH catalysts, as it allows for better dispersion and isolation of active sites.

5. Acid-base properties: In alumina-supported molybdena catalysts, the acidic alumina contributes to deep oxidation and dehydrogenation, while the molybdena phase is involved in ODH and secondary overoxidation.

6. Metal oxide combinations: Some of the best-performing catalysts for ethane ODH are based on NiO oxide (e.g., NiO-Al2O3, Ni/Nb/O, NiO-MgO) and mixed molybdates (e.g., Mo/V/Sb/O, Mo/V/Nb/O, Mo/V/Te/Nb/O).

These factors contribute to the industrial significance of these catalysts by allowing for the tuning of selectivity, activity, and stability in alkane transformation processes. The ability to control the distribution of active sites, adjust acid-base properties, and optimize electronic characteristics enables the development of more efficient and selective catalysts for industrial applications.

金属基催化剂的组成、结构和反应条件显著影响烷烃转化在氧化脱氢(ODH)和沸石催化反应中的机理和效率:

1. 载体材料：载体的选择影响丙烷ODH的选择性。硅胶负载的钒氧化物催化剂通常比氧化铝负载的更具选择性，而后者又比二氧化钛负载的更具选择性。这主要是由于平行丙烷燃烧程度的差异。

2. 金属组成：催化剂中金属的组合影响性能。例如，在VCoAPO-18中，酸性位点(来自Co2+)和氧化还原位点(来自V5+/4+和Co3+/2+)的存在对乙烷ODH中的高乙烯选择性至关重要。

3. 电子性质：催化剂表面的功函数与丙烯选择性相关。较低的功函数值通常会导致更高的选择性。

4. 金属分散和隔离：将活性金属物种(如钒)同构替代到微孔和介孔材料中是设计新型ODH催化剂的有效策略，因为它可以实现活性位点的更好分散和隔离。

5. 酸碱性质：在氧化铝负载的钼基催化剂中，酸性氧化铝促进深度氧化和脱氢，而钼氧化物相则参与ODH和二次过氧化。

6. 金属氧化物组合：一些性能最佳的乙烷ODH催化剂基于NiO氧化物(如NiO-Al2O3、Ni/Nb/O、NiO-MgO)和混合钼酸盐(如Mo/V/Sb/O、Mo/V/Nb/O、Mo/V/Te/Nb/O)。

这些因素通过允许调整烷烃转化过程中的选择性、活性和稳定性，对这些催化剂的工业重要性做出了贡献。控制活性位点分布、调整酸碱性质和优化电子特性的能力使得开发更高效和更具选择性的工业应用催化剂成为可能。
