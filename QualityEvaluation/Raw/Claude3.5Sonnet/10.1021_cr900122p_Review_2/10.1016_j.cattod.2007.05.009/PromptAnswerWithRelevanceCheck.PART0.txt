[1] "In general, in propane ODH catalysts made of Voxide supported on silica are more selective than those made with the alumina support, and the latter are more selective than those supported on titania, mainly because of the lower extent of parallel propane combustion, especially at low vanadia loading"

[2] "The reduction and catalytic properties of active VOx domains can be significantly affected by the formation of binary dispersed structures. For example, VOx-CrOx and VOx-MoOx mixed structures lead to a higher propane ODH rate and selectivity than VOx domains present at similar surface densities on pure Al2O3 supports"

[3] "The activation of the ethane CH bond proceeds through the formation of alkoxides, which decompose to ethylene and a surface OH group or are oxidized to surface-bound oxygenates (acetaldehyde)."

[4] "A key factor in the design of efficient catalysts for alkane ODH is the isolation of active sites. Therefore, the isomorphous substitution of active metal species, e.g., vanadium, into microporous and mesoporous materials is an attractive strategy for designing new catalysts for this reaction"

[5] "In the case of VCoAPO-18, the presence of both acid sites (related to the presence of Co2+ cations) and redox sites (related to the presence of V5+/4+ and Co3+/2+) seems to be an important factor in achieving high selectivities to ethylene during the ODH of ethane"

The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations in processes like oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH):

1. Support material: Vanadium oxide catalysts supported on silica are generally more selective than those on alumina or titania for propane ODH, due to lower parallel combustion reactions.

2. Binary dispersed structures: Mixing VOx with other oxides like CrOx or MoOx can improve propane ODH rates and selectivity compared to pure VOx on Al2O3.

3. Reaction mechanism: For ethane ODH, the C-H bond activation occurs through alkoxide formation, which then decomposes to ethylene or oxidizes to oxygenates.

4. Site isolation: Incorporating active metal species like vanadium into microporous or mesoporous materials can improve catalyst efficiency by isolating active sites.

5. Dual functionality: In some catalysts like VCoAPO-18, the presence of both acid sites (from Co2+) and redox sites (from V5+/4+ and Co3+/2+) contributes to high ethylene selectivity in ethane ODH.

These factors contribute to the industrial significance of these catalysts by improving selectivity, activity, and yield in alkane transformation processes. However, further optimization is still needed to achieve commercially viable performance levels for ODH reactions.

金属基催化剂的组成、结构和反应条件对烷烃转化过程(如氧化脱氢(ODH))的机理和效率有显著影响:

1. 载体材料:在丙烷ODH反应中,负载在二氧化硅上的钒氧化物催化剂通常比负载在氧化铝或二氧化钛上的更具选择性,这是由于平行燃烧反应较少。

2. 二元分散结构:将VOx与CrOx或MoOx等其他氧化物混合,可以提高丙烷ODH的反应速率和选择性,相比于纯VOx/Al2O3催化剂。

3. 反应机理:对于乙烷ODH,C-H键的活化是通过形成烷氧基进行的,随后分解成乙烯或氧化成含氧化合物。

4. 位点隔离:将钒等活性金属物种掺入微孔或介孔材料中,可以通过隔离活性位点来提高催化剂效率。

5. 双功能性:在某些催化剂(如VCoAPO-18)中,酸性位点(来自Co2+)和氧化还原位点(来自V5+/4+和Co3+/2+)的共同存在有助于在乙烷ODH反应中获得高乙烯选择性。

这些因素通过提高烷烃转化过程的选择性、活性和产率,增强了这些催化剂的工业重要性。然而,要达到商业可行的ODH反应性能水平,仍需进一步优化。

[2] "The selectivity to propylene can be also correlated with thework functionvalues which decrease in the series: VWTi > VTi > VFe-Ti > VAlTi > VCaTi"

[3] "The isomorphous substitution of active metal species, e.g., vanadium, into microporous and mesoporous materials is an attractive strategy for designing new catalysts for this reaction"

[4] "In the case of VCoAPO-18, the presence of both acid sites (related to the presence of Co2+ cations) and redox sites (related to the presence of V5+/4+ and Co3+/2+) seems to be an important factor in achieving high selectivities to ethylene during the ODH of ethane"

[5] "In alumina-supported samples, alumina contributes to the primary deep oxidation and dehydrogenation routes of ethane to COx and coke respectively, which proceed effectively over the acidic centers. The molybdena phase is involved in the ODH of ethane and the secondary overoxidation of ethylene to COx"

[6] "Catalysts giving outstanding performance are those based on NiO oxide (NiO-Al2O3, Ni/Nb/O and NiO-MgO), and mixed molybdates (Mo/V/Sb/O, Mo/V/Nb/O and Mo/V/Te/Nb/O)"

The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations in oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) and zeolite-catalyzed reactions:

1. Support material: The choice of support affects selectivity in propane ODH. Silica-supported vanadium oxide catalysts are generally more selective than alumina-supported ones, which in turn are more selective than titania-supported catalysts. This is primarily due to differences in the extent of parallel propane combustion.

2. Metal composition: The combination of metals in the catalyst impacts performance. For example, in VCoAPO-18, the presence of both acid sites (from Co2+) and redox sites (from V5+/4+ and Co3+/2+) is crucial for high ethylene selectivity in ethane ODH.

3. Electronic properties: The work function of the catalyst surface correlates with propylene selectivity. Lower work function values generally lead to higher selectivity.

4. Metal dispersion and isolation: Isomorphous substitution of active metal species (e.g., vanadium) into microporous and mesoporous materials is an effective strategy for designing new ODH catalysts, as it allows for better dispersion and isolation of active sites.

5. Acid-base properties: In alumina-supported molybdena catalysts, the acidic alumina contributes to deep oxidation and dehydrogenation, while the molybdena phase is involved in ODH and secondary overoxidation.

6. Metal oxide combinations: Some of the best-performing catalysts for ethane ODH are based on NiO oxide (e.g., NiO-Al2O3, Ni/Nb/O, NiO-MgO) and mixed molybdates (e.g., Mo/V/Sb/O, Mo/V/Nb/O, Mo/V/Te/Nb/O).

These factors contribute to the industrial significance of these catalysts by allowing for the tuning of selectivity, activity, and stability in alkane transformation processes. The ability to control the distribution of active sites, adjust acid-base properties, and optimize electronic characteristics enables the development of more efficient and selective catalysts for industrial applications.

1. 载体材料：载体的选择影响丙烷ODH的选择性。硅胶负载的钒氧化物催化剂通常比氧化铝负载的更具选择性，而后者又比二氧化钛负载的更具选择性。这主要是由于平行丙烷燃烧程度的差异。

2. 金属组成：催化剂中金属的组合影响性能。例如，在VCoAPO-18中，酸性位点(来自Co2+)和氧化还原位点(来自V5+/4+和Co3+/2+)的存在对乙烷ODH中的高乙烯选择性至关重要。

3. 电子性质：催化剂表面的功函数与丙烯选择性相关。较低的功函数值通常会导致更高的选择性。

4. 金属分散和隔离：将活性金属物种(如钒)同构替代到微孔和介孔材料中是设计新型ODH催化剂的有效策略，因为它可以实现活性位点的更好分散和隔离。

5. 酸碱性质：在氧化铝负载的钼基催化剂中，酸性氧化铝促进深度氧化和脱氢，而钼氧化物相则参与ODH和二次过氧化。

6. 金属氧化物组合：一些性能最佳的乙烷ODH催化剂基于NiO氧化物(如NiO-Al2O3、Ni/Nb/O、NiO-MgO)和混合钼酸盐(如Mo/V/Sb/O、Mo/V/Nb/O、Mo/V/Te/Nb/O)。

这些因素通过允许调整烷烃转化过程中的选择性、活性和稳定性，对这些催化剂的工业重要性做出了贡献。控制活性位点分布、调整酸碱性质和优化电子特性的能力使得开发更高效和更具选择性的工业应用催化剂成为可能。

[1] "In propane ODH, the catalytic activity of vanadium oxide catalysts increases with the V2O5 loading, while rates per V-atom reach a maximum on VOx domains of intermediate size, providing a balance between the activity of surface VOx species and their accessibility to reactants."

[2] "The selectivity to the corresponding olefins shows a peak for intermediate values of active phase loading, which corresponds to the development of the monolayer structure."

[3] "Isolated sites are beneficial for propylene selectivity, but they do not completely cover the support surface, on which the hydrocarbons can be adsorbed and further oxidized to COx."
