[1] "In general, in propane ODH catalysts made of Voxide supported on silica are more selective than those made with the alumina support, and the latter are more selective than those supported on titania, mainly because of the lower extent of parallel propane combustion, especially at low vanadia loading"

[2] "The catalytic activity of vanadium oxide catalysts increases with the V2O5 loading, while rates per V-atom reach a maximum on VOx domains of intermediate size, providing a balance between the activity of surface VOx species and their accessibility to reactants."

[3] "For both propane and ethane, reactivity data for catalysts made of supported vanadium oxide are consistent both with kinetically relevant steps involving the dissociation of CH bonds (methylenic C atom in propane) and with a Mars-van Krevelen redox mechanism involving lattice oxygen in CH bond activation."

[4] "The isomorphous substitution of active metal species, e.g., vanadium, into microporous and mesoporous materials is an attractive strategy for designing new catalysts for this reaction"

[5] "One of the best performing catalysts in propane ODH is the VOx-SBA-15 system, prepared by an alcoholic impregnation method, in which the introduction of V species onto the inner walls of SBA-15 provides a system with a large concentration of accessible, isolated and structurally well-defined active sites."

The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations in oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) processes:

1. Catalyst composition: The type of support greatly affects selectivity. Vanadium oxide catalysts supported on silica are generally more selective than those on alumina, which in turn are more selective than those on titania. This is due to differences in the extent of parallel propane combustion.

2. Catalyst structure: The loading of active metal (e.g., V2O5) impacts catalytic activity. Activity increases with loading, but rates per V-atom peak at intermediate domain sizes, balancing activity and accessibility of active sites. 

3. Reaction mechanism: For supported vanadium oxide catalysts, the ODH of propane and ethane involves C-H bond dissociation and follows a Mars-van Krevelen redox mechanism using lattice oxygen.

4. Catalyst design strategies: Isomorphous substitution of active metals like vanadium into microporous and mesoporous materials is an effective approach for creating new ODH catalysts.

5. High-performance systems: VOx-SBA-15, prepared by alcoholic impregnation, is one of the best-performing catalysts for propane ODH. It provides a high concentration of accessible, isolated, and well-defined active sites.

These factors contribute to the industrial significance of such catalysts by allowing for the tuning of activity, selectivity, and stability in alkane transformation processes.

金属基催化剂的组成、结构和反应条件显著影响烷烃转化在氧化脱氢(ODH)过程中的机理和效率:

1. 催化剂组成:载体类型极大地影响选择性。以二氧化硅为载体的钒氧化物催化剂通常比以氧化铝为载体的更具选择性,后者又比以二氧化钛为载体的更具选择性。这是由于平行丙烷燃烧程度的差异。

2. 催化剂结构:活性金属(如V2O5)的负载量影响催化活性。活性随负载量增加而增加,但每个V原子的反应速率在中等域尺寸时达到峰值,平衡了活性位点的活性和可及性。

3. 反应机理:对于负载型钒氧化物催化剂,丙烷和乙烷的ODH涉及C-H键断裂,遵循Mars-van Krevelen氧化还原机理,使用晶格氧。

4. 催化剂设计策略:将活性金属(如钒)同晶取代到微孔和介孔材料中是创造新型ODH催化剂的有效方法。

5. 高性能系统:通过醇浸渍法制备的VOx-SBA-15是丙烷ODH最佳催化剂之一。它提供了高浓度的可及、孤立和结构明确的活性位点。

这些因素通过允许调节烷烃转化过程中的活性、选择性和稳定性,为此类催化剂的工业重要性做出了贡献。
