[1] "In general, in propane ODH catalysts made of Voxide supported on silica are more selective than those made with the alumina support, and the latter are more selective than those supported on titania, mainly because of the lower extent of parallel propane combustion, especially at low vanadia loading"

[2] "The selectivity to propylene formation is affected by surface reduction: the higher the surface reduction, the higher the selectivity"

[3] "The reduction and catalytic properties of active VOx domains can be significantly affected by the formation of binary dispersed structures. For example, VOx-CrOx and VOx-MoOx mixed structures lead to a higher propane ODH rate and selectivity than VOx domains present at similar surface densities on pure Al2O3 supports"

[4] "Additives (e.g., P, K, Ca, Ni, Cr, Nb, Mg, Au, Zn and Mo), sometimes added in relevant amount with respect to V, modify acidbasic and redox properties of supported vanadium oxide"

[5] "Examples include V-containing high-surface siliceous materials, such as MCM-41, MCM-48 or SBA-15. In these systems, the catalytic activity of vanadium is strongly influenced by its local environment and the co-existence of acid sites in the host material."

The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations in processes like oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH). For supported vanadium oxides:

1. The support material affects selectivity, with silica-supported catalysts generally being more selective than alumina-supported ones, which are in turn more selective than titania-supported catalysts. This is mainly due to differences in the extent of parallel propane combustion.

2. Surface reduction of the catalyst influences selectivity, with higher surface reduction leading to higher selectivity to propylene in propane ODH.

3. The formation of binary dispersed structures, such as VOx-CrOx and VOx-MoOx, can enhance both the rate and selectivity of propane ODH compared to pure VOx domains on Al2O3 supports.

4. Various additives (e.g., P, K, Ca, Ni, Cr, Nb, Mg, Au, Zn, Mo) can modify the acid-base and redox properties of supported vanadium oxide, thereby affecting catalytic performance.

5. For metal-exchanged zeolites and other high-surface materials (e.g., MCM-41, MCM-48, SBA-15), the local environment of the vanadium and the presence of acid sites in the host material strongly influence catalytic activity.

These factors contribute to the industrial significance of these catalysts by allowing for fine-tuning of catalytic properties to optimize yield, selectivity, and efficiency in alkane transformation processes. The ability to control these parameters enables the development of more effective and economically viable catalytic systems for industrial applications.

金属基催化剂的组成、结构和反应条件显著影响烷烃转化过程(如氧化脱氢(ODH))的机理和效率。对于负载型钒氧化物催化剂：

1. 载体材料影响选择性，通常硅胶负载的催化剂比氧化铝负载的更具选择性，后者又比二氧化钛负载的更具选择性。这主要是由于平行丙烷燃烧程度的差异。

2. 催化剂表面还原程度影响选择性，表面还原程度越高，丙烷ODH反应中对丙烯的选择性越高。

3. 形成二元分散结构（如VOx-CrOx和VOx-MoOx）可以提高丙烷ODH的反应速率和选择性，相比于纯Al2O3载体上的VOx结构。

4. 各种添加剂（如P、K、Ca、Ni、Cr、Nb、Mg、Au、Zn、Mo）可以改变负载型钒氧化物的酸碱性和氧化还原性，从而影响催化性能。

5. 对于金属交换沸石和其他高比表面材料（如MCM-41、MCM-48、SBA-15），钒的局部环境和主体材料中酸性位的存在强烈影响催化活性。

这些因素通过允许对催化性能进行微调以优化烷烃转化过程中的产率、选择性和效率，从而提高了这些催化剂的工业重要性。控制这些参数的能力使得开发更有效和经济可行的工业应用催化系统成为可能。
