          [1] "Application of alternative oxidants in the form of various oxygen-containing molecules opens new possibilities. The idea of this approach is as follows. Variation of the oxidant chemistry should change the state of surface oxygen, while the activation of organic molecules may remain unchanged or affected to a smaller degree, thus providing new opportunity for controlling the selectivity."

[2] "In 1983, Iwamoto et al. [7] were the first to use N2O for the oxidation of benzene: [reaction equation] This reaction over a vanadia catalyst allowed achieving much better selectivity as compared to the oxidation by dioxygen. At 550 8C, the reaction selectivity exceeded 70%."

[3] "As for the nature of the catalytic activity, two different approaches were suggested. One of them is based on a traditional notion that zeolites are the acidic catalysts with strong Brønsted and Lewis sites. The other one relates to the common oxidation catalysis, which might be provided by the presence of a transition metal admixture."

[4] "Presently, one may conclude that the iron idea seems to be generally accepted, although the detailed structure and composition of α-sites till now are not perfectly clear and thus are the subject of many theoretical [54–60] and experimental [58,61–69] studies."

[5] "The reduced iron atoms of complex (III) appear to be inert to dioxygen. However, they are readily oxidized at elevated temperatures (over 200 8C) by nitrous oxide into complex (IV) to give adsorbed O a species. Namely, this reversible redox transition Fe2+ ↔ Fe3+ between complexes (III) and (IV) is considered to provide a selective transfer of oxygen atoms from N2O to hydrocarbon molecules to be oxidized."

[6] "Presently, many researchers are trying to use N2O for conducting various oxidation reactions by the catalytic way at elevated temperature. Quite good selectivities were achieved in the oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes [40,42,43] and in the epoxidation of propylene to propylene oxide [86]."

[7] "To suppress such side transformations and especially coking, leading to a heavy problem of the catalyst deactivation, the researchers are trying to neutralize various functional groups on the zeolite surface but leaving intact the α-sites. This is a difficult challenge."

          The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations. For supported vanadium oxides, the use of alternative oxidants like N2O can change the state of surface oxygen, allowing better control of selectivity compared to traditional O2 oxidation. This was demonstrated in the oxidation of benzene using vanadia catalysts, where N2O achieved much higher selectivity than O2 at 550°C.

For metal-exchanged zeolites, particularly iron-containing ones, the catalytic activity stems from either the acidic nature of zeolites (Brønsted and Lewis sites) or the presence of transition metal admixtures. The iron forms specific active sites called α-sites within the zeolite structure, which are responsible for the selective transfer of oxygen atoms from N2O to hydrocarbon molecules. The reaction mechanism involves a reversible redox transition between Fe2+ and Fe3+ states, occurring at elevated temperatures (over 200°C) in the presence of N2O.

Reaction conditions, especially temperature, play a crucial role in determining efficiency and selectivity. At elevated temperatures, N2O can be used for oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes and epoxidation reactions with good selectivities. However, high temperatures can also lead to side reactions and coking, causing catalyst deactivation.

The industrial significance of these catalysts is influenced by their selectivity, efficiency, and stability. Researchers are working on improving catalyst performance by neutralizing certain functional groups on the zeolite surface while preserving the active α-sites. This approach aims to suppress side reactions and coking, enhancing the catalyst's longevity and industrial viability.

Overall, the interplay between catalyst composition (e.g., presence of transition metals), structure (e.g., zeolite framework), and reaction conditions (e.g., temperature, oxidant choice) determines the efficiency and selectivity of alkane transformations, making these factors crucial for developing industrially significant processes.

          金属基催化剂的组成、结构和反应条件显著影响烷烃转化的机理和效率。对于负载型钒氧化物，使用N2O等替代氧化剂可以改变表面氧的状态，与传统的O2氧化相比，可以更好地控制选择性。这在使用钒催化剂氧化苯的实验中得到了证明，在550°C下，N2O比O2实现了更高的选择性。

对于金属交换的沸石，特别是含铁的沸石，催化活性来源于沸石的酸性（布伦斯特酸和路易斯酸位点）或过渡金属掺杂物的存在。铁在沸石结构中形成特定的活性位点，称为α位点，负责将氧原子从N2O选择性地转移到烃分子上。反应机理涉及Fe2+和Fe3+状态之间的可逆氧化还原转变，这一过程在N2O存在下于较高温度（200°C以上）下发生。

反应条件，尤其是温度，在决定效率和选择性方面起着关键作用。在高温下，N2O可用于烷烃的氧化脱氢和环氧化反应，具有良好的选择性。然而，高温也可能导致副反应和积碳，造成催化剂失活。

这些催化剂的工业重要性受到其选择性、效率和稳定性的影响。研究人员正在努力通过中和沸石表面的某些官能团，同时保留活性α位点来改善催化剂性能。这种方法旨在抑制副反应和积碳，提高催化剂的寿命和工业可行性。

总的来说，催化剂组成（如过渡金属的存在）、结构（如沸石骨架）和反应条件（如温度、氧化剂选择）之间的相互作用决定了烷烃转化的效率和选择性，使这些因素对开发具有工业重要性的过程至关重要。
