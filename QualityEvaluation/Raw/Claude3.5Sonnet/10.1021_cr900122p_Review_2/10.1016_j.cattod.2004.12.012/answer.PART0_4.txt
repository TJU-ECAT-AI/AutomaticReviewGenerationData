[1] "Application of alternative oxidants in the form of various oxygen-containing molecules opens new possibilities. The idea of this approach is as follows. Variation of the oxidant chemistry should change the state of surface oxygen, while the activation of organic molecules may remain unchanged or affected to a smaller degree, thus providing new opportunity for controlling the selectivity."

[2] "In 1983, Iwamoto et al. [7] were the first to use N2O for the oxidation of benzene: [reaction equation] This reaction over a vanadia catalyst allowed achieving much better selectivity as compared to the oxidation by dioxygen. At 550 8C, the reaction selectivity exceeded 70%."

[3] "As for the nature of the catalytic activity, two different approaches were suggested. One of them is based on a traditional notion that zeolites are the acidic catalysts with strong Bro
nsted and Lewis sites. The other one relates to the common oxidation catalysis, which might be provided by the presence of a transition metal admixture."

[4] "Presently, many researchers are trying to use N2O for conducting various oxidation reactions by the catalytic way at elevated temperature. Quite good selectivities were achieved in the oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes [40,42,43] and in the epoxidation of propylene to propylene oxide [86]."

The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations. For supported vanadium oxides, the use of alternative oxidants like N2O can change the state of surface oxygen, allowing better control of selectivity compared to using O2. This was demonstrated in the oxidation of benzene using vanadia catalysts, where N2O achieved much higher selectivity than O2 at 550°C.

For metal-exchanged zeolites, two main factors contribute to their catalytic activity: the acidic nature of zeolites (Brønsted and Lewis sites) and the presence of transition metal admixtures, particularly iron. The micropore structure of zeolites allows for the formation of specific active sites (α-sites) that are highly effective for selective oxidation reactions.

Reaction conditions, especially temperature, play a crucial role. Many oxidation reactions using N2O are conducted at elevated temperatures to achieve good selectivities, as seen in the oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes and epoxidation of propylene.

The industrial significance of these catalysts stems from their ability to perform selective oxidations with high efficiency, potentially enabling more direct and environmentally friendly processes for the production of important chemicals like phenol and propylene oxide. The use of N2O as an oxidant in these reactions offers a promising alternative to traditional oxidation methods, potentially leading to more efficient and selective industrial processes.

金属基催化剂的组成、结构和反应条件显著影响烷烃转化的机理和效率。对于负载型钒氧化物，使用N2O等替代氧化剂可以改变表面氧的状态，与使用O2相比可以更好地控制选择性。这在使用钒催化剂氧化苯的反应中得到了证明，在550°C时，N2O比O2获得了更高的选择性。

对于金属交换沸石，两个主要因素影响其催化活性：沸石的酸性（布朗斯特和路易斯位点）和过渡金属掺杂物的存在，特别是铁。沸石的微孔结构允许形成特定的活性位点（α-位点），这些位点对选择性氧化反应高度有效。

反应条件，尤其是温度，起着至关重要的作用。许多使用N2O的氧化反应在高温下进行以获得良好的选择性，正如在烷烃的氧化脱氢和丙烯环氧化中所看到的那样。

这些催化剂的工业意义在于它们能够高效地进行选择性氧化，有可能实现更直接、更环保的重要化学品（如苯酚和环氧丙烷）生产过程。在这些反应中使用N2O作为氧化剂为传统氧化方法提供了一个有前景的替代方案，有可能导致更高效、更具选择性的工业过程。
