[1] "In particular, research groups of Lunsford [3,4] and Somorjai [5,6] showed that application of N2O oxidant over supported MoO3 and V2O5 oxides provided high selectivity of methane oxidation to methanol and formaldehyde, especially at low conversions."

[2] "As for the nature of the catalytic activity, two different approaches were suggested. One of them is based on a traditional notion that zeolites are the acidic catalysts with strong Brønsted and Lewis sites. The other one relates to the common oxidation catalysis, which might be provided by the presence of a transition metal admixture."

[3] "Presently, many researchers are trying to use N2O for conducting various oxidation reactions by the catalytic way at elevated temperature. Quite good selectivities were achieved in the oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes [40,42,43] and in the epoxidation of propylene to propylene oxide [86]."

[4] "To suppress such side transformations and especially coking, leading to a heavy problem of the catalyst deactivation, the researchers are trying to neutralize various functional groups on the zeolite surface but leaving intact the α-sites. This is a difficult challenge."

The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations. For supported vanadium oxides, the use of N2O as an oxidant provided high selectivity for methane oxidation to methanol and formaldehyde at low conversions. 

In zeolite-catalyzed reactions, the catalytic activity stems from either the acidic nature of zeolites (Brønsted and Lewis sites) or the presence of transition metal admixtures, particularly iron. The iron forms α-sites in the zeolite matrix, which are crucial for selective oxidation reactions.

Reaction conditions, such as temperature, play a vital role. At elevated temperatures, N2O can be used for oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes and epoxidation reactions with good selectivities. However, high temperatures can also lead to side reactions and coking, causing catalyst deactivation.

The industrial significance of these catalysts is influenced by their selectivity, efficiency, and stability. Researchers are working on improving catalyst performance by neutralizing certain functional groups on the zeolite surface while preserving the active α-sites. This approach aims to suppress side reactions and coking, enhancing the catalyst's longevity and industrial viability.

Overall, the interplay between catalyst composition (e.g., presence of transition metals), structure (e.g., zeolite framework), and reaction conditions (e.g., temperature, oxidant choice) determines the efficiency and selectivity of alkane transformations, making these factors crucial for developing industrially significant processes.

金属基催化剂的组成、结构和反应条件显著影响烷烃转化的机理和效率。对于负载型钒氧化物催化剂，使用N2O作为氧化剂可在低转化率下实现甲烷氧化为甲醇和甲醛的高选择性。

在分子筛催化反应中，催化活性来源于分子筛的酸性（布伦斯特酸和路易斯酸位点）或过渡金属掺杂物的存在，特别是铁。铁在分子筛基质中形成α位点，这对选择性氧化反应至关重要。

反应条件，如温度，起着至关重要的作用。在高温下，N2O可用于烷烃的氧化脱氢和环氧化反应，具有良好的选择性。然而，高温也可能导致副反应和积碳，造成催化剂失活。

这些催化剂的工业重要性受到其选择性、效率和稳定性的影响。研究人员正在努力通过中和分子筛表面的某些官能团，同时保留活性α位点来改善催化剂性能。这种方法旨在抑制副反应和积碳，提高催化剂的寿命和工业可行性。

总的来说，催化剂组成（如过渡金属的存在）、结构（如分子筛骨架）和反应条件（如温度、氧化剂选择）之间的相互作用决定了烷烃转化的效率和选择性，使这些因素对开发具有工业重要性的过程至关重要。
