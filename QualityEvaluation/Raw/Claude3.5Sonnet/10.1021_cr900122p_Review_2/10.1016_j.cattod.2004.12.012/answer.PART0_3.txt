[1] "Application of alternative oxidants in the form of various oxygen-containing molecules opens new possibilities. The idea of this approach is as follows. Variation of the oxidant chemistry should change the state of surface oxygen, while the activation of organic molecules may remain unchanged or affected to a smaller degree, thus providing new opportunity for controlling the selectivity."

[2] "In 1983, Iwamoto et al. [7] were the first to use N2O for the oxidation of benzene:
(2)
This reaction over a vanadia catalyst allowed achieving much better selectivity as compared to the oxidation by dioxygen. At 550 8C, the reaction selectivity exceeded 70%."

[3] "As for the nature of the catalytic activity, two different approaches were suggested. One of them is based on a traditional notion that zeolites are the acidic catalysts with strong Bro
nsted and Lewis sites. The other one relates to the common oxidation catalysis, which might be provided by the presence of a transition metal admixture."

[4] "Presently, many researchers are trying to use N2O for conducting various oxidation reactions by the catalytic way at elevated temperature. Quite good selectivities were achieved in the oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes [40,42,43] and in the epoxidation of propylene to propylene oxide [86]."

The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations. For supported vanadium oxides, the use of alternative oxidants like N2O can change the state of surface oxygen, allowing better control of selectivity compared to traditional O2 oxidation. This was demonstrated in the oxidation of benzene using vanadia catalysts, where N2O achieved much higher selectivity than O2 at 550°C.

For metal-exchanged zeolites, two main approaches explain their catalytic activity: their acidic nature (Brønsted and Lewis sites) and the presence of transition metal admixtures, particularly iron. The metal content and distribution within the zeolite structure play a crucial role in determining catalytic performance.

Reaction conditions, especially temperature, greatly affect the efficiency and product distribution. For instance, N2O has been successfully used at elevated temperatures for oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes and epoxidation of propylene, achieving good selectivities.

The industrial significance of these catalysts stems from their ability to perform selective oxidations and transformations under milder conditions or with better selectivity than traditional methods. This can lead to more efficient processes, reduced byproduct formation, and potentially lower energy requirements, all of which are important factors for industrial applications.

金属基催化剂的组成、结构和反应条件显著影响烷烃转化的机理和效率。对于负载型钒氧化物，使用N2O等替代氧化剂可以改变表面氧的状态，与传统的O2氧化相比，可以更好地控制选择性。这在使用钒催化剂氧化苯的实验中得到了证明，在550°C下，N2O比O2实现了更高的选择性。

对于金属交换的沸石，有两种主要方法解释其催化活性：它们的酸性（布朗斯特和路易斯位点）和过渡金属掺杂物的存在，特别是铁。金属含量和在沸石结构中的分布对确定催化性能起着关键作用。

反应条件，尤其是温度，极大地影响效率和产品分布。例如，N2O在高温下已成功用于烷烃的氧化脱氢和丙烯的环氧化，实现了良好的选择性。

这些催化剂的工业重要性源于它们能够在更温和的条件下或以比传统方法更好的选择性进行选择性氧化和转化。这可以导致更高效的过程、减少副产品的形成，并可能降低能源需求，所有这些都是工业应用的重要因素。
