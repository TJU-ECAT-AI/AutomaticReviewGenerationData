[1] "In particular, research groups of Lunsford [3,4] and Somorjai [5,6] showed that application of N2O oxidant over supported MoO3 and V2O5 oxides provided high selectivity of methane oxidation to methanol and formaldehyde, especially at low conversions."

[2] "As for the nature of the catalytic activity, two different approaches were suggested. One of them is based on a traditional notion that zeolites are the acidic catalysts with strong Brønsted and Lewis sites. The other one relates to the common oxidation catalysis, which might be provided by the presence of a transition metal admixture."

[3] "Presently, one may conclude that the iron idea seems to be generally accepted, although the detailed structure and composition of α-sites till now are not perfectly clear and thus are the subject of many theoretical [54–60] and experimental [58,61–69] studies."

[4] "To suppress such side transformations and especially coking, leading to a heavy problem of the catalyst deactivation, the researchers are trying to neutralize various functional groups on the zeolite surface but leaving intact the α-sites. This is a difficult challenge."

The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations. For supported vanadium oxides, the application of N2O as an oxidant over V2O5 provided high selectivity for methane oxidation to methanol and formaldehyde, especially at low conversions. 

For metal-exchanged zeolites, particularly iron-containing ZSM-5, the catalytic activity stems from the presence of iron rather than just the acidic properties of zeolites. The iron forms specific active sites called α-sites, though their exact structure and composition are still subjects of ongoing research. These α-sites play a crucial role in selective oxidation reactions.

Reaction conditions, such as temperature, can affect the efficiency and selectivity of the reactions. At elevated temperatures, side reactions and coking can occur, leading to catalyst deactivation. Researchers are working on neutralizing certain functional groups on the zeolite surface while preserving the α-sites to mitigate these issues.

The industrial significance of these catalysts is tied to their ability to perform selective oxidation reactions, such as the direct conversion of benzene to phenol. However, challenges remain in optimizing catalyst performance and stability for large-scale industrial applications.

金属基催化剂的组成、结构和反应条件显著影响烷烃转化的机理和效率。对于负载型钒氧化物，使用N2O作为氧化剂在V2O5上能够提供甲烷氧化为甲醇和甲醛的高选择性，特别是在低转化率下。

对于金属交换的沸石，尤其是含铁的ZSM-5，催化活性源于铁的存在，而不仅仅是沸石的酸性特性。铁形成特定的活性位点，称为α-位点，尽管它们的确切结构和组成仍然是正在进行的研究主题。这些α-位点在选择性氧化反应中起着关键作用。

反应条件，如温度，可以影响反应的效率和选择性。在高温下，可能发生副反应和积碳，导致催化剂失活。研究人员正在努力中和沸石表面的某些官能团，同时保留α-位点，以缓解这些问题。

这些催化剂的工业重要性与它们执行选择性氧化反应的能力有关，如苯直接转化为苯酚。然而，在优化催化剂性能和稳定性以用于大规模工业应用方面仍存在挑战。
