summary 
Catalysts obtained by interacting Ti(CH&,H,)4 or Zr(A-&H& with the 
surface of SiOz and treated with hydrogen possess a very high activity with 
respect to hydrogenation 
of benzene and cyclohexene. 
This activity is 
commensurable with that of supported Group VIII metals. The catalysts 
were studied by chemisorption, thermodesorption 
and EXAFS methods, 
and were shown to contain anchored hydride complexes of Ti and Zr, whose 
content can be controlled by varying the temperature of their treatment 
with hydrogen. A quantitative correlation exists between the specific activity 
of the catalysts under consideration in hydrogenation reactions and the 
content of hydride complexes in these catalysts. 
Introduction 
Catalysts containing surface hydride complexes of Group IVB transi- 
tion metals (E,,) 
are active in olefin polymerization 
[l, 21 and olefin 
hydrogenation 
[3, 41. Complexes with EIv-H 
bonds are formed on the 
surfaces of oxide supports upon heating anchored organometallic complexes 
of Ti, Zr or Hf under vacuum or hydrogen atmosphere [ 1,2). 
It has been found recently [5] that catalysts with surface Ti hydrides 
are very active with respect to benzene and cyclohexene 
hydrogenations. 
The specific activity of these catalysts is commensurable with that of sup- 
ported Group VIII metals, and particularly with the activity of Ni/SiOz. 
Surface hydrides of Group IVB transition metals are precursors of 
active sites of olefin polymerization [ 
6 - 81, but their role in hydrogenation 
is not clear as yet, because the hydrogenation may be expected to occur also 
on low-valent E1v ions formed via decomposition 
of anchored organo- 
metallic complexes. In this work, in order tb determine the nature of the 
active sites in EIV/SiOZ catalysts (Elv = Ti or Zr) that are responsible for

benzene and cyclohexene 
hydrogenations, 
we compared the rates of these 
reactions with the content of E,v-H 
bonds in the catalysts, and also exam- 
ined the state of Erv and the local coordination of Zr. 
Experimental 
Cc talyst preparation 
Catalysts were prepared by treating silica (250 m* g-l) dehydrated in 
vacuum at 873 K with a pentane solution of Ti(CH2CsH& 
or Zr(z-C&I&. 
The treatment was followed by washing the residues of unreacted complexes 
with pentane and by removal of the solvent by evacuation at 298 K. At 
this step of the preparation, the following reaction occurs [ 1,2] : 
n(?Si-OH) 
+ E,vR4 
- 
(SSi-O),ER+. 
+ nRH t 
(1) 
where SSi-OH 
are surface hydroxyl groups of Si02, En, = Ti or Zr, R = 
CH2C6H5 and z-CsHs for Ti and Zr, respectively. 
The catalysts were then treated with hydrogen at 423 - 873 K. At this 
step the removal of organic ligands, formation of surface hydride complexes 
of Ti or Zr [ 1, 21, and partial reduction of EIv ions to lower oxidation 
states [ 91 occur. 
All procedures of catalyst 
preparation 
and study were performed 
without contact with air. 
Thermodesorp tion measurements 
These were carried out in a high-vacuum static reactor furnished with a 
mass spectrometer. 
The samples, pretreated with hydrogen at a definite 
temperature, 
were placed in the reactor, and then were outgassed to lo- 
torr and heated to 873 K at a rate of 5 K min-. The organic products 
desorbed (mainly benzene and toluene in the case of Ti/Si02 and propane 
in the case of Zr/Si02) resulting from decomposition 
of organic ligand 
residues were frozen out with liquid nitrogen. The desorbed gaseous prod- 
ucts were predominantly hydrogen with methane impurities (in the case of 
Ti/SiOz no more than 5 - 10 vol.% CH4). The total amount of hydrogen 
evolved was calculated relative to the content of Ti or Zr in the catalysts. 
Benzene hydrogenation 
This was performed in a glass static reactor (with circulation) at 423 K 
(on Ti/Si02) or 363 K (on Zr/Si02) at C6H6 and H2 pressures of 50 and 300 
torr, respectively. The reaction was followed by the measuring pressure 
drop of the reaction mixture; the products were analyzed chromatograph- 
ically . 
Cyclohexene hydrogenation 
This was performed 
in a similar reactor at 298 K and pressures of 
C6H10, H2 and Ar of 50, 150 and 500 torr, respectively. The activities of 
123 
both reactions were calculated from the initial linear portion of the com- 
position us. time curve at a conversion of <lo%. 
Adsorption measurements 
These were carried out using a flow pulse system with a chromato- 
graphic analysis. The reduced samples were evacuated at the reduction 
temperature at 10m3 torr, and the amount of the oxygen adsorbed was then 
measured at 298 - 873 K. 
EXAFS 
X-ray spectra at the K-edge of zirconium absorption were taken using 
synchrotron radiation of the storage ring VEPP-4, installed in the Institute 
of Nuclear Physics of the Siberian Division of the U.S.S.R. 
Academy of 
Sciences, 
by the method described in [lo]. 
Spectra were analyzed over 
the range from 3.8 - 12.0 A- as described in [lo]. 
The accuracy of the 
determination of the positions of coordination maxima was kO.06 A. Coordi- 
nation numbers were not determined because of the presence of the third 
order in the radiation spectrum of the storage ring.

Hydrogen content in catalysts 
Figure 1 illustrates the dependence of the quantity of desorbed hydro- 
gen, calculated relative to the content of Ti or Zr in the catalysts, on the 
temperature of prereduction. In the case of the Ti/SiO* catalyst reduced at 
423 K, more than two hydrogen atoms are desorbed from each titanium ion. 
The amount 
of the desorbed hydrogen monotonically 
decreases almost 
to zero with increasing temperature

(Fig. 1, curve 1). The amount of the desorbed hydrogen agrees within an 
accuracy of 20% with the amount of hydrogen in Ti/SiOz determined by the 
method of deuterium exchange [ 51. 
An analogous dependence is observed for the Zr/SiO, catalyst (Fig. 1, 
curve 2), but at the same temperatures of reduction the content of hydrogen 
in this catalyst is 1.5 - 2 times lower than that in Ti/SiO,. 
The content of H, in the products of desorption of E,v/Si02 catalysts 
not subjected to hydrogen pretreatment is at least one order of magnitude 
smaller in comparison with the reduced samples. Thus, the amount of Hz 
formed during dehydrogenation of organic ligands that occur upon thermo- 
desorption has little effect on the total amount of desorbed hydrogen. This 
fact indicates that the total amount of desorbed hydrogen is due to hydride 
complexes of titanium and zirconium, whose content in the catalysts tends 
to decrease with increasing temperature of reduction. 
Oxidation state of Ti and Zr ions (Table 1) 
The Ti/SiO* catalysts reduced at 423 and 573 K adsorb oxygen in 
amounts O/Ti = 1.37 and 0.92, respectively, (atomic ratio) at 298 K, and as 
a result are decolourized due to the oxidation of titanium ions to Ti4+. 
A rise of oxidation temperature to 673 K is accompanied by a negligible 
increase in the amount of the adsorbed oxygen in comparison with adsorp- 
tion at 298 K (Table 1). From the amount of oxygen consumed for the 
complete oxidation of Erv/SiO? at 673 - 873 K (O/E,,), 
a mean oxidation 
number of El,(n) 
in the initial catalyst can be calculated by eqn. (1): 
n = 4 - 20/E, 
+ H/E,, 
(1) 
The addend in eqn. (1) allows a correction for the oxygen consumed for the 
titration of E,v -H 
complexes. 
The calculated values of n for the Ti/SiO, 
catalysts reduced at 423 and 573 are 3.4 and 3.0, respectively. 
The Ti/SiO* sample reduced at 873 K absorbs oxygen in amounts 
O/Ti = 0.70 at 873 K. The estimated value of n for this sample is 2.7, which 
indicates the presence ,of some Ti2+ ions, along with Ti3+ ions in it. 
On increasing the reduction temperature, the mean oxidation number 
in the Zr/SiO, system calculated via eqn. (1) decreases from 3.4 to 3.2. 
EXA FS data 
The X-ray spectra at the K-edge of zirconium absorption for Zr/SiO, 
catalysts are shown in Fig. 2. Figure 3 illustrates the radial distribution of 
atoms (RDA) around the ionized zirconium atom which have been obtained 
by Fourier transform of the oscillating structure of the spectra. All RDA 
curves have peaks at (R - Si) z 1.0 A, the position and intensity of which 
depend largely upon the spectra treatment 
procedure. 
Consequently, 
all 
these peaks are spurious, in other words, are caused by errors in isolation 
and analysis of the fine structure of X-ray spectra (in particular, by incorrect 
application of Fourier analysis to this region (R - 6,)). The spurious maxima 
on the RDA curves are indicated by asterisks (*). The intensity of the

maxima at (R - Si) > 4 A corresponds to the noise level. Most probable 
assignments of the coordination maxima to bond lengths, with corrections 
for phase shifts (6,_, 
= 0.48 A and Gzr_zr = 0.24 A) [ll], 
are listed in 
Table 2. 
On the RDA curve of the non-reduced Zr/SiOz catalyst (Fig. 3, curve 1) 
the coordination peak at (R - Si) = 1.62 A can be attributed to the Zr-0 
bond of zirconium with the oxygen of SiOz [12]. It seems likely that the 
Zr-C 
distance between the zirconium atom and carbon atoms of ally1 
ligands contributes to the coordination maximum at (R - Si) = 1.62 A of 
the non-reduced Zr/SiO, catalyst. The length of this bond (2.10 A after 
correction for Si) is close to the metal-carbon distance in a series of x-ally1 
complexes of transition metals of the second period, e.g. in (n-CsH5PdC1)2 
(2.1 A) [13]. According to PMR data [14], in the molecule of Zr(n-&H,), 
all ally1 groups are equivalent and are symmetrically bonded with the zir- 
conium atom. Therefore it can be assumed that in the surface Zr complex 
all ZrC 
distances are also equivalent. Moreover, the experimental data on 
ally1 metal complexes indicate that the M-C distance deviation in them is 
0.08 A [18], which is beyond the accuracy of the EXAFS method. 
The intensities of the subsequent coordination peaks (Fig. 3, curve 1) 
are close to the noise level, which makes their accurate interpretation quite 
difficult. A peak at (R - Sj) = 2.48 A can be attributed to the Zr-0-Si 
distance in the anchored n-ally1 complex. The corresponding peaks were 
attributed to ZrO-Zr 
and Zr-0-Si 
distances on the basis of experimental 
data on ZI-0 
and Zr-O-M 
distances and also characteristic values of 
Si-0 
distances and Zr-O-M 
angles. 
All RDA curves of the Zr/SiO, catalysts reduced with Hz at 423 - 873 
K show a peak at (R - Si) = 1.48 + 0.02 A, which has been attributed to the

(1.96 A with correction for the phase shift) distance in the surface 
Zr complex. There are two known modifications of zirconium oxide, namely 
monoclinic and cubic ZrOz. The Zr-0 
distance of 1.96 + 0.02 A observed 
corresponds to neither of the modifications. This distance is too short for 
the cubic modification; regarding the monoclinic ZrO,, a set .of distances 
should have given a far broader peak than that observed in our case. 
For the catalyst reduced at 423 K (Fig. 3, curve 2), a peak at (R - Si) = 
3.08 A seems to belong to the distance between zirconium ions bound 
through bridge oxygen. The ratio between coordination numbers for Zr-0 
and Zr-0-Zr 
distances is close to 3:l. This ratio corresponds best to the 
structure in which the zirconium ion is in a tetrahedral surrounding of 
oxygen ions and hydride anions, the zirconium ions being bound through 
bridge oxygen atoms to give dimers. An increase in the temperature of 
reduction of the catalysts diminishes the amplitude of the maxima at 
(R 
- 
St) 
= 
3.08 A to the value comparable to the noise level (Fig. 3, curves 3 
and 4), which may be caused by the dissociation of dimeric hydride com- 
plexes of zirconium. It should be mentioned that the dissociation of the 
surface rhenium trimers, obtained by interacting [ 
Re(OC,H,)J s with silica, 
during the course of the high-temperature treatment has been observed earlier 
[15], Thus, in catalysts reduced at 573 - 873 K the isolated zirconium ions 
bound with the oxygen of the support are prevailing. Note that the Zr-H 
128 
bonds cannot 
be observed 
by EXAFS because the photoelectron 
scattering 
on hydrogen 
atoms is insignificant. 
Catalytic properties 
of EIv/SiOz 
Ti/Si02 
The dependences 
of the catalytic 
properties 
of E1v/SiOz catalysts 
on 
the temperature 
of their 
hydrogen 
treatment 
are shown in Table 1. The 
Ti/SiOz 
catalysts 
were found 
to be very 
active 
with respect 
to benzene 
hydrogenation. 
When reduced 
with hydrogen 
at 423 K, the catalyst 
had a 
specific activity 
of 0.02 s-l. This value is close to the specific activity 
of the 
supported 
Pd/SiOs catalyst, 
which is about 0.1 s-l under identical 
conditions 
WI. 
On increasing 
the reduction 
temperature 
to 873 K, the specific activity 
of the Ti/SiOz catalyst falls by more than one order of magnitude. 
In the hydrogenation 
of cyclohexene 
at 298 K, the specific activity of 
the Ti/SiOz 
catalyst 
reduced 
at 423 K is 0.6 SC. Note for comparison 
that 
the specific activity 
of the Pt/SiOz catalyst 
in this reaction 
is 2.0 s-l (295 K, 
c,n 
10 
= 75 torr) 
[ 171. When the reduction 
temperature 
of Ti/SiOz is raised 
to 873 K, the activity falls by a factor of 30, as in benzene hydrogenation. 
Zr/SiO 2 
The specific activity 
of the Zr/SiO, 
catalyst, 
reduced with hydrogen 
at 
423 K with respect 
to benzene 
hydrogenation 
at 363 K is 0.02 s-l (to be 
compared 
with 3.3 X 10e3 se1 for Pd/SiO* under the same conditions 
[16]). 
Thus, 
in our conditions 
Zr/SiO, 
is six times 
more 
active 
than 
Pd/SiO,. 
In addition, 
Zr/SiO, 
is far more active than Ti/SiO,, 
since at nearly the same 
activities 
of these samples the reaction 
temperature 
for the former 
is 60 K 
lower. 
However, 
as for Ti/SiO*, the activity 
of Zr/SiO, 
also tends to fall 
drastically 
with increasing reduction 
temperature. 
In contrast, 
in cyclohexene 
hydrogenation 
the 
specific 
activity 
of 
Zr/SiO, 
reduced 
at 423 K is one order of magnitude 
smaller than that of 
Ti/SiOz. Also, with increasing 
reduction 
temperature 
the activity 
of Zr/SiO, 
with respect to cyclohexene 
hydrogenation 
monotonically 
decreases. 
The only benzene 
hydrogenation 
product 
observed 
on both catalysts 
was cyclohexane. 
The absence of cyclohexene 
in the products 
seems to be 
due to the fact that the rate of its hydrogenation 
is some orders of magni- 
tude higher than that of benzene. 
Discussion 
State of Ti and Zr ions in E,,/Si02 
The presence 
of surface 
Ti-H 
and Zr-H 
complexes 
in reduced 
Eiv/ 
SiOz catalysts 
was shown earlier 
by means of IR spectroscopy 
[l, 21. In 
this work the amount 
of such hydride 
complexes 
was determined. 
As sug- 
129 
gested by thermodesorption data, hydride hydrogen in Ti/SiOz and Zr/SiO, 
reduced at 423 K accounts for approximately 1.5 - 2 atoms of hydrogen per 
ion of Erv (Fig. 1). The mean oxidation number of Ti and Zr in these sam- 
ples determined from Oz adsorption is n = 3, 4. The latter is in agreement 
with ESR data that indicate the presence of isolated Ti3+ and Zr3+ ions, 
comprising -10 - 20% of the total amount of supported metals, in E,v/ 
SiOz catalysts reduced at 423 K [9]. The process of formation of Ti hydride 
complexes upon treatment with Hz at 423 K may be described by the 
following scheme:

The literature [

The most probable structures of the surface complexes E,v/Si02 at different 
reduction temperatures are shown in Table 1. 
An increase in reduction temperature of Erv/SiO, systems leads to a 
sharp fall of the content of Erv 
-H complexes in them, as well as to addi- 
tional reduction of Erv ions. The Erv/Si02 catalysts treated with hydrogen 
at 873 K contain predominantly Ti3+ and Zr3+ ions which are not bound 
with hydrogen. The oxidation states obtained from O2 adsorption data are 
supported by ESCA data. The binding energy (E,.,) of Ti 23, for the 
Ti/Si02 sample treated with hydrogen at 873 K is 459.5 eV, which is almost 
the same as Eb of Ti3+ in TiC13 
[ 
191. 
According to high resolution transmission electron microscopy (TEM) 
data [ 
191, upon supporting tetrabenzyltitanium or tetraallylzirconium on 
Si02 and further reducing with H2 at 573 - 873 K the morphology of silica 
remains nearly unchanged. This is evidence that neither three-dimensional 
disperse particles of oxides nor extended twodimensional 
surface com- 
pounds of titanium or zirconium are present in these samples. 
In this work, we have obtained direct evidence by EXAFS methods that 
all Zr/SiO, catalysts contain surface zirconium ions bound with the oxygen 
of the support. The catalyst reduced at 423 K seems to have dimeric hydride 
complexes of zirconium chemically bound with the oxygen of Si02. Note 
130 
that despite 
a rather 
low oxidation 
number 
of Zr, the ZrO 
distance 
ob- 
served (1.96 A) is considerably 
shorter 
than in the known modifications 
of 
ZrOz and Zr silicates [12]. This allows us to assert that there are no particles 
of bulk Zr oxides in the system studied. 
Rather, surface species are formed, 
in which the oxygen 
surrounding 
the Zr is partially 
substituted 
by hydride 
anions. 
However, 
we are unaware 
of any individual 
molecular 
analogs to 
these surface compounds. 
In the samples treated 
with hydrogen 
at 573 - 873 
K, the peaks of the subsequent 
coordination 
spheres of zirconium 
are weak, 
which 
indicates 
the absence 
of heavy elements, 
namely 
Zr atoms, 
in the 
second 
coordination 
sphere 
of an ionizing 
atom. 
This fact allows us to 
conclude 
that the Zr/SiO, 
catalysts 
reduced 
at 573 - 873 K have predom- 
inantly 
isolated 
zirconium 
ions bound 
with the surface 
oxygen 
of SiOz. 
This conclusion 
is in agreement 
with the high resolution 
electron 
microscopy 
data, indicating 
the absence of finely dispersed particles of oxides and other 
zirconium 
compounds 
in the catalysts under consideration. 
Thus, the E,v/SiOz catalysts 
treated 
with hydrogen 
contain 
Ti-H 
and 
Zr-H 
complexes 
chemically 
bound with the surface oxygen 
of the support 
(Table 
1). The concentrations 
of these complexes 
in the catalysts 
can be 
controlled 
by varying the temperature 
of their reduction. 
Correlation

of EIV 
-H complexes 
in the catalysts and 
their activity with respect to hydrogenation 
We have found 
that 
anchored 
hydride 
complexes 
of titanium 
and 
zirconium 
show very high catalytic 
activities 
in benzene 
and cyclohexene 
hydrogenation 
which 
are comparable

conditions. 
Pez and Crisey [20] 
reported 
the hydrogenation 
of benzene 
in the presence 
of bulk hydrides 
of 
Ti, Zr, Hf, Nb, La and V. 
It is known that benzene 
hydrogenation 
occurs readily 
in the presence 
of solutions 
of transition 
metal complexes, 
including those of titanium 
[21 - 
241. It was assumed 
[21, 241 that precursors 
of active sites of homogeneous 
hydrogenation 
of benzene 
are mononuclear 
hydride 
complexes 
of transition 
elements. 
From a comparison 
of the dependences 
of activities 
(Table 1) and con- 
tents 
of hydride 
hydrogen 
in the catalysts 
on their reduction 
temperature, 
it follows that the specific activity 
of Erv/SiOz catalysts towards hydrogena- 
tion is in quantitative 
agreement 
with the content 
of Erv-H 
complexes 
in 
the catalysts 
(Figs. 4 and 5). The dependence 
of the specific activity 
on the 
concentration 
of Erv-H 
complexes 
in the catalysts 
can be described 
by 
a simple low-power 
equation: 
A = k[E,v-H]m 
(4) 
In cyclohexene 
hydrogenation 
(Fig. 4), the activity 
is proportional 
to the 
content 
of Erv -H 
complexes 
in the catalysts. 
A linear correlation 
between 
the activity 
in the hydrogenation 
and the content 
of the En,-H 
complexes 
suggests that either all surface complexes 
having a Ti-H 
(or Zr-H) 
bond, or

a portion 
of the hydride 
complexes 
which 
is constant 
relative 
to their 
total 
amount, 
are active sites of hydrogenation. 
Low-valent 
titanium 
and 
zirconium 
ions, nonbound 
to hydrogen, 
are inactive 
with respect 
to the 
hydrogenation 
(Table 1). Regarding benzene hydrogenation, 
the dependence 
of the activity 
on the content 
of EIv -H 
complexes 
in the catalyst 
is non- 
linear (Fig. 5). The values of exponent 
m in eqn. (4) are 1.7 and 2.8 for 
Ti/SiO, 
and Zr/SiOz, 
respectively, 
which 
means that two or three 
neigh- 
bouring 
surface hydride 
complexes, 
having a sufficient 
number of hydrogen 
atoms for the complete 
hydrogenation 
of C&H,, take part in the hydrogena- 
tion 
of one benzene 
molecule. 
Support 
for this conclusion 
comes 
from 
EXAFS 
data 
indicating 
the presence 
of anchored 
dimeric 
hydride 
com- 
plexes of zirconium 
in the Zr/SiO, catalysts reduced 
at 423 K. 
The mechanism 
of benzene 
hydrogenation 
on anchored 
hydride 
com- 
plexes 
of Ti and Zr appears 
to be similar to that of homogeneous 
hydro- 
genation 
in solutions 
of the complexes 
of these elements 
[21 - 241, which 
includes 
the consecutive 
addition 
of hydrogen 
atoms 
to the molecule 
of 
benzene, 
leading to the formation 
of r-complexes 
bound with the atom of 
the transition 
element. 
Additional 
investigations 
are necessary 
for an under- 
standing 
of the mechanism 
of benzene 
hydrogenation 
on surface 
E,,-H 
complexes.
