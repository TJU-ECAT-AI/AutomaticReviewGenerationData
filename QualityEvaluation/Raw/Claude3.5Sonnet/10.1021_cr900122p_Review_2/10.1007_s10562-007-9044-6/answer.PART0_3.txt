[1] "Incorporation of zinc cations into high-silica zeolites enhances the selectivity of zeolite catalysts towards light alkane dehydrogenation and aromatization [13]."

[2] "It seems that the incorporated Zn2+ cations act as strong Lewis sites and change the mechanism of the alkane activation and transformation favoring a hydrogen removal step [2, 410]."

[3] "Analysis of the results on characterization of zinc species suggested that Zn/H-MFI involves three types of Zn species: small and large ZnO clusters and zinc cations."

[4] "For Zn/H-MFI sample used in this study with high Zn content, (OZ)(ZnOZn)2+(OZ) or (ZO)Zn+OSi cations should preferably form based on the literature data [2, 22]. However, the presence of Zn2+ or ZnOH+ cannot be excluded."

[5] "For the case with Zn- containing H-MFI, the dehydrogenation of propane molecule to form carbenium ion can occur either on zinc cations or Lewis sites of subnanomeric custers of ZnO due to prevalence of these two Zn species in the zeolite [1, 23, 2629]."

The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts, particularly zinc-exchanged zeolites, significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations. 

Incorporating zinc cations into high-silica zeolites enhances the selectivity towards light alkane dehydrogenation and aromatization. The zinc cations act as strong Lewis sites, changing the mechanism of alkane activation and transformation by favoring hydrogen removal.

In Zn/H-MFI catalysts, three types of zinc species are present: small and large ZnO clusters, and zinc cations. The specific form of zinc species depends on the zinc content, with high zinc content favoring the formation of (OZ)(ZnOZn)2+(OZ) or (ZO)Zn+OSi cations, although Zn2+ or ZnOH+ may also be present.

The dehydrogenation of propane to form carbenium ions can occur on either zinc cations or Lewis sites of subnanometric ZnO clusters, which are the two prevalent zinc species in the zeolite. This demonstrates how the composition and structure of the catalyst directly affect the reaction mechanism.

These factors contribute to the industrial significance of metal-exchanged zeolites in alkane transformation processes. The ability to tune the catalyst's composition and structure allows for enhanced selectivity and efficiency in important reactions such as dehydrogenation and aromatization, making these catalysts valuable for industrial applications.

金属基催化剂的组成、结构和反应条件，特别是锌交换沸石，对烷烃转化的机理和效率有重大影响。

将锌阳离子掺入高硅沸石中可以提高沸石催化剂对轻烷烃脱氢和芳构化的选择性。锌阳离子作为强路易斯酸位点，通过促进氢的脱除来改变烷烃活化和转化的机理。

在Zn/H-MFI催化剂中，存在三种类型的锌物种：小型和大型ZnO簇，以及锌阳离子。锌物种的具体形式取决于锌含量，高锌含量有利于(OZ)(ZnOZn)2+(OZ)或(ZO)Zn+OSi阳离子的形成，尽管Zn2+或ZnOH+也可能存在。

丙烷脱氢形成碳正离子可以在锌阳离子或亚纳米ZnO簇的路易斯酸位点上进行，这两种锌物种在沸石中是主要存在形式。这表明催化剂的组成和结构直接影响反应机理。

这些因素都有助于金属交换沸石在烷烃转化过程中的工业重要性。能够调节催化剂的组成和结构，可以在重要反应（如脱氢和芳构化）中提高选择性和效率，使这些催化剂在工业应用中具有重要价值。
