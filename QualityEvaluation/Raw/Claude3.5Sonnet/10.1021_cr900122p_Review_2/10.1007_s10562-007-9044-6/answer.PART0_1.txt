[1] "Incorporation of zinc cations into high-silica zeolites enhances the selectivity of zeolite catalysts towards light alkane dehydrogenation and aromatization [13]."

[2] "It seems that the incorporated Zn2+ cations act as strong Lewis sites and change the mechanism of the alkane activation and transformation favoring a hydrogen removal step [2, 410]."

[3] "Analysis of the results on characterization of zinc species suggested that Zn/H-MFI involves three types of Zn species: small and large ZnO clusters and zinc cations."

[4] "For Zn/H-MFI sample used in this study with high Zn content, (OZ)(ZnOZn)2+(OZ) or (ZO)Zn+OSi cations should preferably form based on the literature data [2, 22]. However, the presence of Zn2+ or ZnOH+ cannot be excluded."

[5] "Regioselectivity of the exchange for Zn/H-MFI implies that the mechanism of the exchange changes, when the zeolite is modified with Zn."

The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations. For zeolite-catalyzed reactions, incorporating zinc cations into high-silica zeolites enhances selectivity towards light alkane dehydrogenation and aromatization. The Zn2+ cations act as strong Lewis sites, changing the mechanism of alkane activation and transformation by favoring hydrogen removal.

In Zn/H-MFI catalysts, three types of zinc species are present: small and large ZnO clusters and zinc cations. The specific form of zinc species depends on the zinc content, with high zinc content favoring the formation of (OZ)(ZnOZn)2+(OZ) or (ZO)Zn+OSi cations, although Zn2+ or ZnOH+ species may also be present.

The modification of zeolites with zinc changes the reaction mechanism, as evidenced by the regioselectivity of hydrogen/deuterium exchange observed in Zn/H-MFI compared to unmodified H-MFI. This change in mechanism contributes to the improved efficiency and selectivity of the catalyst for specific alkane transformations.

These factors contribute to the industrial significance of metal-exchanged zeolites by allowing for more selective and efficient alkane transformations, which are crucial in various industrial processes such as the production of valuable petrochemicals and fuels.

金属基催化剂的组成、结构和反应条件显著影响烷烃转化的机理和效率。对于沸石催化反应，将锌阳离子掺入高硅沸石可以提高对轻烷烃脱氢和芳构化的选择性。Zn2+阳离子作为强Lewis酸位点，通过促进氢的移除来改变烷烃活化和转化的机理。

在Zn/H-MFI催化剂中，存在三种类型的锌物种：小型和大型ZnO簇以及锌阳离子。锌物种的具体形式取决于锌含量，高锌含量有利于形成(OZ)(ZnOZn)2+(OZ)或(ZO)Zn+OSi阳离子，但Zn2+或ZnOH+物种也可能存在。

用锌改性沸石会改变反应机理，这从Zn/H-MFI中观察到的氢/氘交换的区域选择性与未改性的H-MFI相比可以得到证实。这种机理的变化有助于提高催化剂对特定烷烃转化的效率和选择性。

这些因素通过允许更具选择性和效率的烷烃转化，为金属交换沸石的工业重要性做出了贡献，这在各种工业过程中至关重要，如有价值的石油化学品和燃料的生产。
