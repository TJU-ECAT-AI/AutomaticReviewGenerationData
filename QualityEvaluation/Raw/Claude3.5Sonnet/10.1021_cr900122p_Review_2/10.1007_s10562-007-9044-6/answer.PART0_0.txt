[1] "Incorporation of zinc cations into high-silica zeolites enhances the selectivity of zeolite catalysts towards light alkane dehydrogenation and aromatization [13]."

[2] "It seems that the incorporated Zn2+ cations act as strong Lewis sites and change the mechanism of the alkane activation and transformation favoring a hydrogen removal step [2, 410]."

[3] "Analysis of the results on characterization of zinc species suggested that Zn/H-MFI involves three types of Zn species: small and large ZnO clusters and zinc cations."

[4] "For Zn/H-MFI sample used in this study with high Zn content, (OZ)(ZnOZn)2+(OZ) or (ZO)Zn+OSi cations should preferably form based on the literature data [2, 22]. However, the presence of Zn2+ or ZnOH+ cannot be excluded."

[5] "The mechanism of H/D exchange for propane involving Zn2+ cations is shown on Scheme 3. Zn2+ cations located at neighbouring [4] or distanly separated [10] basic oxygens of the Si O Al groups in the zeolite framework provide a heterolytic dissociative adsorption of propane and offer Zn-propyl species and acid protons of the SiOHAl group."

The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts, particularly zinc-modified zeolites like Zn/H-MFI, significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations. 

The incorporation of zinc cations into high-silica zeolites enhances the selectivity towards light alkane dehydrogenation and aromatization. The zinc species in Zn/H-MFI exist in three forms: small and large ZnO clusters, and zinc cations. These zinc species, especially Zn2+ cations, act as strong Lewis sites and change the mechanism of alkane activation and transformation, favoring hydrogen removal.

The structure of the catalyst plays a crucial role in the reaction mechanism. Zn2+ cations located at neighboring or distantly separated basic oxygens of the Si-O-Al groups in the zeolite framework provide heterolytic dissociative adsorption of propane, offering Zn-propyl species and acid protons of the Si-OH-Al group. This structural arrangement facilitates the H/D exchange mechanism for propane.

The reaction conditions, such as temperature and the presence of other molecules like CO, also affect the efficiency of alkane transformations. For instance, the study shows that co-adsorption of CO suppresses the H/D exchange for propane on Zn/H-MFI.

These factors contribute to the industrial significance of metal-based catalysts in processes such as oxidative dehydrogenation and zeolite-catalyzed reactions. The ability to control the selectivity and efficiency of alkane transformations through careful manipulation of catalyst composition, structure, and reaction conditions makes these catalysts valuable for industrial applications in petrochemical and fine chemical production.

金属基催化剂的组成、结构和反应条件，特别是像Zn/H-MFI这样的锌改性沸石，显著影响烷烃转化的机理和效率。

将锌阳离子掺入高硅沸石中可以提高沸石催化剂对轻烷烃脱氢和芳构化的选择性。Zn/H-MFI中的锌物种以三种形式存在：小的和大的ZnO簇，以及锌阳离子。这些锌物种，特别是Zn2+阳离子，作为强Lewis酸位点，改变了烷烃活化和转化的机理，有利于氢的脱除。

催化剂的结构在反应机理中起着关键作用。位于沸石骨架中Si-O-Al基团相邻或远离的基本氧原子处的Zn2+阳离子提供了丙烷的异裂解离吸附，形成Zn-丙基物种和Si-OH-Al基团的酸质子。这种结构安排促进了丙烷的H/D交换机理。

反应条件，如温度和其他分子（如CO）的存在，也会影响烷烃转化的效率。例如，研究表明CO的共吸附会抑制Zn/H-MFI上丙烷的H/D交换。

这些因素对金属基催化剂在氧化脱氢和沸石催化反应等过程中的工业重要性有所贡献。通过谨慎操控催化剂组成、结构和反应条件来控制烷烃转化的选择性和效率的能力，使这些催化剂在石油化工和精细化工生产中具有重要的工业应用价值。
