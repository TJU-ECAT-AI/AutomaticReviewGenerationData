[1] "Incorporation of zinc cations into high-silica zeolites enhances the selectivity of zeolite catalysts towards light alkane dehydrogenation and aromatization [13]."

[2] "It seems that the incorporated Zn2+ cations act as strong Lewis sites and change the mechanism of the alkane activation and transformation favoring a hydrogen removal step [2, 410]."

[3] "Analysis of the results on characterization of zinc species suggested that Zn/H-MFI involves three types of Zn species: small and large ZnO clusters and zinc cations."

[4] "For Zn/H-MFI sample used in this study with high Zn content, (OZ)(ZnOZn)2+(OZ) or (ZO)Zn+OSi cations should preferably form based on the literature data [2, 22]. However, the presence of Zn2+ or ZnOH+ cannot be excluded."

[5] "Regioselectivity of the exchange for Zn/H-MFI implies that the mechanism of the exchange changes, when the zeolite is modified with Zn."

The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations. For zeolite-catalyzed reactions, incorporating zinc cations into high-silica zeolites enhances selectivity towards light alkane dehydrogenation and aromatization. The zinc species in Zn/H-MFI exist in three forms: small and large ZnO clusters, and zinc cations. These zinc species, particularly Zn2+ cations, act as strong Lewis sites and alter the mechanism of alkane activation and transformation, favoring hydrogen removal.

The presence of different zinc species ((OZ)(ZnOZn)2+(OZ), (ZO)Zn+OSi, Zn2+, or ZnOH+) in the zeolite structure affects the reaction pathways. For instance, the modification of H-MFI with zinc changes the mechanism of hydrogen exchange, leading to regioselective exchange in propane. This regioselectivity implies a different reaction mechanism compared to unmodified zeolites.

These factors contribute to the industrial significance of metal-exchanged zeolites by allowing for more selective and efficient alkane transformations. The ability to control the type and distribution of metal species in the zeolite structure enables the design of catalysts with specific properties tailored for particular industrial processes.

金属基催化剂的组成、结构和反应条件显著影响烷烃转化的机理和效率。对于沸石催化反应，将锌阳离子引入高硅沸石可提高对轻烷烃脱氢和芳构化的选择性。Zn/H-MFI中的锌物种以三种形式存在：小型和大型ZnO簇，以及锌阳离子。这些锌物种，特别是Zn2+阳离子，作为强Lewis酸位点，改变了烷烃活化和转化的机理，有利于氢的脱除。

沸石结构中不同锌物种（(OZ)(ZnOZn)2+(OZ)、(ZO)Zn+OSi、Zn2+或ZnOH+）的存在影响反应途径。例如，用锌改性H-MFI改变了氢交换的机理，导致丙烷中的区域选择性交换。这种区域选择性意味着与未改性沸石相比存在不同的反应机理。

这些因素通过允许更选择性和高效的烷烃转化，促进了金属交换沸石的工业重要性。控制沸石结构中金属物种的类型和分布的能力，使得可以设计具有特定性能的催化剂，以适应特定的工业过程。
