[1] "Isolated molybdate species supported on silica are reported to have the highest specific activity and selectivity for the direct oxidation of methane to formaldehyde."

[2] "The present investigation was undertaken to understand the elementary redox processes involved in the formation of formaldehyde over such species."

[3] "Low concentrations of H2O were observed to enhance the activity of MoOx/SiO2 for CH4 oxidation to formaldehyde."

[4] "It is proposed that peroxides are produced by the reaction of O2 with a small concentration of reduced molybdate species and that the reaction of CH4 with these peroxide species leads to the formation of formaldehyde."

The literature focuses on molybdenum oxide catalysts supported on silica (MoOx/SiO2) for methane oxidation to formaldehyde, rather than vanadium oxides or zeolites. However, some insights can be drawn regarding catalyst composition, structure, and reaction conditions:

1. Composition: Isolated molybdate species on silica show the highest activity and selectivity for methane oxidation to formaldehyde.

2. Structure: The catalyst consists of isolated, pentacoordinated molybdate species containing a single Mo=O bond.

3. Reaction conditions: Low concentrations of H2O enhance catalyst activity.

4. Mechanism: The proposed mechanism involves the formation of peroxide species through reaction of O2 with a small concentration of reduced molybdate species. These peroxides then react with CH4 to form formaldehyde.

5. Efficiency: The catalyst maintains a very low level of reduction during steady-state operation, with only 50-500 ppm of MoVI reduced to MoIV.

While this study does not directly address oxidative dehydrogenation or zeolite-catalyzed reactions, it demonstrates how detailed mechanistic understanding can lead to improved catalyst design and performance for industrially relevant processes like methane conversion.

该文献主要关注了以二氧化硅为载体的钼氧化物催化剂(MoOx/SiO2)用于甲烷氧化制甲醛的研究,而非钒氧化物或沸石。但是,我们仍可以从中获得一些关于催化剂组成、结构和反应条件的见解:

1. 组成:二氧化硅上的孤立钼酸盐物种表现出最高的甲烷氧化制甲醛活性和选择性。

2. 结构:催化剂由孤立的、五配位的钼酸盐物种组成,含有单个Mo=O键。

3. 反应条件:低浓度的H2O可以提高催化剂活性。

4. 机理:提出的机理涉及O2与少量还原态钼酸盐物种反应形成过氧化物种。这些过氧化物种随后与CH4反应生成甲醛。

5. 效率:在稳态运行过程中,催化剂保持极低的还原程度,仅有50-500 ppm的MoVI被还原为MoIV。

尽管这项研究没有直接涉及氧化脱氢或沸石催化反应,但它展示了详细的机理理解如何能够促进催化剂设计和性能的改进,从而应用于甲烷转化等工业相关过程。
