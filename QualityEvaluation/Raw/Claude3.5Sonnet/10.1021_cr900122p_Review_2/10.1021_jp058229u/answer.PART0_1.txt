[1] "Isolated molybdate species supported on silica are reported to have the highest specific activity and selectivity for the direct oxidation of methane to formaldehyde."

[2] "On the basis of evidence from extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) and Raman spectroscopy, the Mo atoms in this catalyst are present as isolated, pentacoordinated molybdate species containing a single MoO bond."

[3] "It was established that treatment of MoOx/SiO2 at 873 K under pure methane reduces the dispersed molybdate species to only a limited extent and results mainly in the deposition of amorphous carbon."

[4] "During CH4 oxidation to formaldehyde, the catalyst undergoes only a very small degree of reduction and typically only 50500 ppm of MoVI is reduced to MoIV."

[5] "Low concentrations of H2O were observed to enhance the activity of MoOx/SiO2 for CH4 oxidation to formaldehyde."

The literature focuses on supported molybdenum oxide catalysts for methane oxidation, rather than vanadium oxides or zeolites. However, some insights can be drawn about how catalyst composition, structure and reaction conditions influence alkane transformation mechanisms:

1. Catalyst composition and structure: Isolated molybdate species supported on silica show the highest activity and selectivity for methane oxidation to formaldehyde. The Mo atoms exist as pentacoordinated species with a single Mo=O bond.

2. Reaction mechanism: The catalyst undergoes very limited reduction during methane oxidation, with only 50-500 ppm of Mo(VI) reduced to Mo(IV). This suggests the active oxygen species are not lattice oxygens, but likely peroxide species formed from gas-phase O2.

3. Effect of reaction conditions: Low concentrations of H2O enhance the catalyst activity, likely by increasing surface hydroxyl groups that can participate in the reaction.

4. Catalyst stability: Under pure methane at high temperature, the catalyst undergoes limited reduction but significant carbon deposition occurs.

While not directly addressing vanadium oxides or zeolites, these findings demonstrate how detailed characterization of catalyst structure and oxidation state during reaction can provide mechanistic insights for alkane activation processes. The high activity of isolated metal sites and promotional effects of water are likely relevant for other oxide catalysts as well.

该文献主要关注了负载型钼氧化物催化剂用于甲烷氧化,而不是钒氧化物或沸石。然而,我们可以从中得出一些关于催化剂组成、结构和反应条件如何影响烷烃转化机理的见解:

1. 催化剂组成和结构:负载在二氧化硅上的孤立钼酸盐物种显示出最高的甲烷氧化制甲醛活性和选择性。钼原子以五配位物种存在,具有单一的Mo=O键。

2. 反应机理:在甲烷氧化过程中,催化剂只经历非常有限的还原,只有50-500 ppm的Mo(VI)被还原为Mo(IV)。这表明活性氧物种不是晶格氧,而可能是由气相O2形成的过氧化物种。

3. 反应条件的影响:低浓度的H2O可以提高催化剂活性,这可能是由于增加了可以参与反应的表面羟基。

4. 催化剂稳定性:在高温纯甲烷下,催化剂经历有限的还原,但会发生明显的碳沉积。

虽然没有直接涉及钒氧化物或沸石,但这些发现表明,对催化剂结构和反应过程中氧化态的详细表征可以为烷烃活化过程提供机理洞察。孤立金属位点的高活性和水的促进作用可能也与其他氧化物催化剂相关。
