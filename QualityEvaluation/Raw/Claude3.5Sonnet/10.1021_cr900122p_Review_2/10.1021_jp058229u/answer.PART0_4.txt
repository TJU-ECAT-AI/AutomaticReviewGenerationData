[1] "Isolated molybdate species supported on silica are reported to have the highest specific activity and selectivity for the direct oxidation of methane to formaldehyde."

[2] "On the basis of evidence from extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) and Raman spectroscopy, the Mo atoms in this catalyst are present as isolated, pentacoordinated molybdate species containing a single MoO bond."

[3] "It is proposed that peroxides are produced by the reaction of O2 with a small concentration of reduced molybdate species and that the reaction of CH4 with these peroxide species leads to the formation of formaldehyde."

[4] "Low concentrations of H2O were observed to enhance the activity of MoOx/SiO2 for CH4 oxidation to formaldehyde."

The literature provides insights into the composition, structure, and reaction conditions of molybdenum-based catalysts for methane oxidation, rather than vanadium oxides or metal-exchanged zeolites specifically. However, some relevant information can be extrapolated:

1. Composition and structure: The most active and selective catalyst for methane oxidation to formaldehyde consists of isolated molybdate species supported on silica. These species are pentacoordinated and contain a single Mo=O bond.

2. Reaction mechanism: The proposed mechanism involves the formation of peroxide species through the reaction of O2 with a small concentration of reduced molybdate species. These peroxides then react with methane to form formaldehyde.

3. Reaction conditions: Low concentrations of H2O in the feed enhance the activity of the catalyst for methane oxidation to formaldehyde.

4. Efficiency: The isolated nature of the molybdate species contributes to high specific activity and selectivity for the direct oxidation of methane to formaldehyde.

While this information doesn't directly address vanadium oxides or zeolites, it demonstrates how the composition, structure, and reaction conditions of a supported metal oxide catalyst can influence its mechanism and efficiency in alkane transformations. Similar principles may apply to other metal-based catalysts in processes like oxidative dehydrogenation.

该文献提供了钼基催化剂在甲烷氧化中的组成、结构和反应条件的见解，而不是特别针对钒氧化物或金属交换沸石。然而，可以从中推断出一些相关信息：

1. 组成和结构：对于甲烷氧化成甲醛，活性最高和选择性最好的催化剂由负载在二氧化硅上的孤立钼酸盐物种组成。这些物种是五配位的，包含一个单一的Mo=O键。

2. 反应机理：提出的机理涉及通过O2与少量还原的钼酸盐物种反应形成过氧化物种。这些过氧化物然后与甲烷反应形成甲醛。

3. 反应条件：进料中低浓度的H2O能够增强催化剂对甲烷氧化成甲醛的活性。

4. 效率：钼酸盐物种的孤立特性有助于直接氧化甲烷成甲醛的高比活性和选择性。

虽然这些信息没有直接涉及钒氧化物或沸石，但它展示了负载金属氧化物催化剂的组成、结构和反应条件如何影响其在烷烃转化中的机理和效率。类似的原理可能适用于其他金属基催化剂在氧化脱氢等过程中的应用。
