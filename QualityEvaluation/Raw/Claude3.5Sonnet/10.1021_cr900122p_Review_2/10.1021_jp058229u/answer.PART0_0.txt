[1] "Isolated molybdate species supported on silica are reported to have the highest specific activity and selectivity for the direct oxidation of methane to formaldehyde."

[2] "The present investigation was undertaken to understand the elementary redox processes involved in the formation of formaldehyde over such species."

[3] "A mechanism for the oxidation of CH4 over MoOx/SiO2 was formulated in light of the observations made here and is discussed in the light of previous studies. It is proposed that peroxides are produced by the reaction of O2 with a small concentration of reduced molybdate species and that the reaction of CH4 with these peroxide species leads to the formation of formaldehyde."

[4] "Low concentrations of H2O were observed to enhance the activity of MoOx/SiO2 for CH4 oxidation to formaldehyde."

The literature focuses primarily on molybdenum oxide catalysts supported on silica (MoOx/SiO2) for methane oxidation to formaldehyde, rather than vanadium oxides or zeolites. However, some insights can be drawn:

1. Composition and structure: Isolated molybdate species on silica show the highest activity and selectivity for methane oxidation to formaldehyde.

2. Reaction mechanism: The proposed mechanism involves the formation of peroxide species through the reaction of O2 with a small concentration of reduced molybdate species. These peroxides then react with methane to form formaldehyde.

3. Reaction conditions: Low concentrations of H2O enhance the catalytic activity for methane oxidation.

4. Efficiency: The catalyst undergoes only a very small degree of reduction during the reaction, with typically only 50-500 ppm of MoVI reduced to MoIV.

While this study does not directly address vanadium oxides or zeolites, it demonstrates how detailed mechanistic studies can provide insights into improving catalyst performance for alkane transformations. The principles of investigating reaction mechanisms, understanding the role of catalyst structure, and identifying the effects of reaction conditions (such as water addition) could be applied to other metal-based catalysts for alkane transformations.

该文献主要集中在研究二氧化硅负载的钼氧化物催化剂(MoOx/SiO2)用于甲烷氧化制甲醛,而非钒氧化物或沸石。然而,我们可以得出一些见解:

1. 组成和结构:在二氧化硅上分散的钼酸盐物种显示出最高的甲烷氧化制甲醛的活性和选择性。

2. 反应机理:提出的机理涉及O2与少量还原态钼酸盐物种反应形成过氧化物。这些过氧化物随后与甲烷反应生成甲醛。

3. 反应条件:低浓度的H2O可以提高甲烷氧化的催化活性。

4. 效率:在反应过程中,催化剂只发生很小程度的还原,通常只有50-500 ppm的MoVI被还原为MoIV。

虽然这项研究没有直接涉及钒氧化物或沸石,但它展示了详细的机理研究如何能为改进烷烃转化催化剂性能提供见解。研究反应机理、理解催化剂结构的作用以及确定反应条件(如添加水)的影响等原则可以应用于其他用于烷烃转化的金属基催化剂。
