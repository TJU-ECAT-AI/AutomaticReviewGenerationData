The given literature does not contain information specifically addressing metal-based catalysts for alkane transformations such as oxidative dehydrogenation or zeolite-catalyzed reactions. The text focuses mainly on methane activation and reforming reactions over nickel catalysts, and does not discuss supported vanadium oxides, metal-exchanged zeolites, or factors influencing their industrial significance for alkane transformations. Therefore, this question cannot be adequately answered based solely on the provided literature.

所给文献并未包含特别涉及金属基催化剂用于烷烃转化(如氧化脱氢或沸石催化反应)的信息。文本主要集中讨论了镍催化剂上的甲烷活化和重整反应,并未讨论负载的钒氧化物、金属交换的沸石,或影响它们在烷烃转化中工业重要性的因素。因此,仅基于所提供的文献无法充分回答这个问题。
