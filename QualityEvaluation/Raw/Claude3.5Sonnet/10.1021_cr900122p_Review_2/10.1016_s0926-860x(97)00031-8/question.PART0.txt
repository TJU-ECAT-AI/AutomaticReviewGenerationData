Abstract 
The use of transient kinetics is reviewed for recent works performed in the wide area of 
methane valorization. The specific contribution of techniques such as steady-state isotopic 
transient kinetics, fast temperature transients, TAP reactor studies is illustrated for reactions 
involving different modes of methane activation and various types of catalysts. 
Keywords: Transient kinetics; Methane activation (catalytic-) 
1. Introduction 
During the last decades, there was a world-wide interest in the conversion 
into value-added products of methane, as the main constituent of natural gas. 
This stimulated a wide range of research activities aimed both at fundamental 
and applied aspects of methane chemistry. Several novel routes for direct 
conversion of methane into higher hydrocarbons and oxygenates were proposed 
and investigated, in parallel with a renewed interest for classical indirect routes 
through syngas formation. 
As far as direct conversion is concerned, such as the oxidative coupling into 
C 2 hydrocarbons, strong limitations of the yield of the envisaged products 
seemed at that time to impede any possibility of process development on an 
industrial scale. In contrast, indirect conversion via syngas does not suffer from 
yield limitations since very high conversion and selectivity can easily be 
achieved. However, a well established industrial process such as steam reform- 
ing is facing now severe environmental requirements, related to the heat

production required by the reaction endothermicity. This led recently to an 
extensive research effort on a less heat-consuming process such as partial 
oxidation. For this case, engineering problems such as heat and mass transfer 
control and catalyst stability have still to be solved. 
Most of the above difficulties simply derive from two basic features of the 
methane molecule: its symmetry and stability. The symmetry renders it ex- 
tremely difficult to control the number of C-H bonds to be activated in a 
catalytic system designed for a selective conversion into desired products. The 
stability of the methane molecule requires severe operating conditions under 
which the products of conversion are far more reactive than methane itself. 
Thus, secondary reactions occur which decompose part of the desired products 
into waste, such as CO 
x in direct oxidative conversions, or coke in non-oxida- 
tive homologation. 
In view of improving the catalytic systems already known for methane 
catalytic conversion, and/or obtaining reliable kinetic schemes for engineering 
modelling studies, reactor development and optimization, a precise knowledge 
of the related mechanisms is obviously required. The transient kinetic analysis, 
using unlabelled or labelled molecules, has already proved to be a powerful and 
unique technique to investigate the way that gas molecules may react with an 
active surface. As a matter of fact, it allows to evaluate the residence time and 
the surface accumulation of the activated intermediates and may also provide 
information on the possible competition in adsorption/desorption steps with 
co-reacting molecules [1]. Moreover, it perfectly applies under the often severe 
temperature conditions required for methane activation, while numerous 
physico-chemical techniques used for catalyst characterization do not. Note, 
however, that recent progress in designing high temperature Fourier transform 
infrared (FTIR) catalytic cells permits now to combine gas and surface in situ 
transient kinetic investigations up to around 900C. 
The transient kinetic analysis is based on the principle (i) of perturbing a 
steady-state established on a working catalyst by changing abruptly one or more 
of the state variables such as feed concentration, molar flow rate, pressure or 
temperature, and (ii) of following the relaxation of the system. The perturbation 
should be imposed on a time scale smaller than the time that allows the 
sequence of elementary steps which control the reaction kinetics to reach again 
the steady-state. Until now, most of the non-steady-state experiments based on 
concentration step functions or temperature changes showed a time resolution 
around one second. Recently a new transient technique derived from molecular 
beam scattering experiments was developed by Gleaves et al. [2]. The temporal 
analysis of products (TAP) reactor, which consists in pulsing very small 
amounts of reacting species over a catalyst maintained under low pressure, 
operates in the millisecond regime. Within the frame of methane activation, 
numerous transient experiments have been reported, indeed, with a time resolu- 
tion adapted to the kind of investigated elementary steps. This paper aims at

illustrating the use of transient kinetic techniques for elucidating the most 
promising routes for methane valorisation through some specific studies carried 
out in our laboratory. 
A simple classification of the ways to activate methane is to consider both the 
mode of involved C-H bond activation --homolytic or heterolytic-- and the 
type of solids --metal or oxide-- which are concerned. Thus, we will first 
consider the methane activation occurring on metal surfaces via a homolytic 
splitting, leading to various CH x and H fragments which may recombine on the 
surface either into methane (reversible activation) or into higher hydrocarbons in 
the absence of oxygen, as for the non-oxidative homologation, or into CO and 
H 2 in the presence of oxidising species, as for the dry reforming by CO 2. 
Second, the activation on basic oxides involving either a heterolytic splitting 
into CH 3 and H , or a homolytic splitting leading directly to methyl radicals 
CH 
3 • will be illustrated by experiments designed for investigating the oxidative 
coupling of methane. Finally, some recent results obtained for the activation of 
methane into aromatics on acidic solids which may involve the heterolytic 
activation into CH- and H- will be presented. 
2. Methane activation on metals 
2.1. Methane reforming by carbon dioxide into syngas 
The mechanism of the carbon dioxide reforming of methane was investigated 
over a model nickel-on-silica catalyst, which was shown to be reasonably stable 
under reaction conditions. Typically, the reaction was carried out at 700C and 
at atmospheric pressure with a reaction mixture CH4/COa/He = 7.5/7.5/85. 
Non-steady-state and steady-state isotopic transient experiments combined with 
in situ DRIFT spectroscopy investigations and magnetic measurements were 
used to quantify the amount of the various adspecies present on the working 
catalyst surface [3-5]. 
2.1.1. Non-steady-state transient experiments 
A first initial transient experiment consisted of following the methane, carbon 
dioxide and carbon monoxide responses during the reaction start-up, i.e., by 
switching at the reactor inlet from a flow of helium to the reaction mixture at 
700C over the reduced catalyst (Fig. 1). The shift between the argon response 
(added as an inert tracer representing the non-catalytic system response) and the 
methane and carbon dioxide led to a non-equilibrated carbon balance (after 
deduction of the produced CO), indicating carbon deposition in the very first 
period of the reaction. This carbon uptake corresponded to a C/Ni s ratio of 2.4, 
where Ni s represents surface metal atoms, as determined by magnetic measure- 
ments and electron microscopy [3]. A temperature programmed hydrogenation

(TPH) experiment carried out after 10 min on stream revealed that part of these 
initial carbon deposits were easily hydrogenated into methane at 230C, leading 
to a C/Ni s ratio of 0.36. This highly reactive carbon was shown further on to 
exist in similar amounts whatever the time on reforming stream. Less easily 
hydrogenated carbons were also shown to accumulate on the catalyst, but at 
increasing amounts with time on stream (a C/Ni s ratio of 23.2 was found after 
67 h of reaction). The latter form of stable carbon was unambiguously ascribed, 
on the basis of TEM studies, to carbonaceous filaments or whiskers participating 
in the slow catalyst deactivation [3]. 
Let us now focus on the most reactive carbon species. Using magnetic 
measurements, the percentage of ferromagnetic nickel was found to correspond 
to 100% of metallic nickel after the initial reduction. As soon as contacted with 
the reaction mixture, the ferromagnetism decreased to 80-90%. After a specific 
hydrogenation of the most reactive carbon species (TPH up to 300C), the initial 
ferromagnetism was restored. This clearly demonstrated that these carbon 
species were in strong chemical interaction with the metallic nickel phase, 
forming a new non-ferromagnetic phase. XPS studies carried out after 10 min on 
stream also revealed the development of a surface nickel carbide phase (known 
to be non-ferromagnetic) [5]. Thus, it could be concluded that under the reaction 
conditions, a carbide-like phase developed on the surface of the metallic Ni 
particles. 
A second type of non-steady-state transient experiments consisted of switch- 
ing from the reaction mixture CHn/CO2/He/Ar to a mixture CO2/He. In this 
case, large amounts of CO were released from the surface under pure CO 2

atmosphere, showing that carbon dioxide could react directly with the carbon 
deposits into CO. The amount of produced CO corresponded to the reverse 
Boudouard reaction -- CO 2 + C  2CO -- allowing the initial carbon de- 
posits to be oxidised by CO 2. 
In a third type of non-steady-state transient experiment the reaction mixture 
CH4/CO2/He/Ar was switched to a mixture CHa/He. A significant residual 
production of hydrogen, corresponding to the conversion of about half the molar 
volume of methane, was observed after this transient step (Fig. 2). This 
demonstrated that under fuel-rich conditions, methane was decomposed into two 
hydrogen molecules and one carbon atom, the latter reacting with the nickel 
phase to form bulk carbide species, as confirmed by a marked decrease of the 
ferromagnetic signal. 
2.1.2. Steady-state isotopic transient kinetic analysis (SSITKA) 
By switching from the reaction mixture t2CH4/12COz/He to the labelled 
mixture 13CH4/2CO2/He/Ar, 
the overall steady-state conditions were main- 
tained while a carbon tracing transient was generated (Fig. 3a and b). The
