[1] "Ga-modified ZSM-5 formulations are industrially preferred mainly due to the high volatility of zinc, and our discussion below describes the synthesis and catalytic function of these Ga-based formulations."

[2] "Gallium-containing ZSM-5 formulations are industrially preferred mainly due to the high volatility of zinc"

[3] "The aromatization of liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) alkanes to aromatics (mainly benzene, toluene, and xylenes, BTX) on Ga-modified ZSM-5 catalysts is commercialized in the Cyclar process jointly developed by UOP and BP."

[4] "Ga3 cations, in the as-prepared catalysts, irrespective of the preparation technique, are re-dispersed under the strongly reducing conditions and high temperatures prevalent during aromatization resulting in the active formulation of the catalyst."

[5] "Wet impregnation of HZSM-5 with gallium salt solutions (Gallium nitrate in general) guarantees gallium deposition on the catalyst, nevertheless, most of the gallium is found to be located on the outside of the zeolite crystals as evidenced by XPS and electron microscopy studies."

The composition, structure and reaction conditions of gallium-modified ZSM-5 catalysts significantly influence their performance in alkane aromatization processes. Specifically:

1. Composition: Gallium is preferred over zinc due to zinc's high volatility. Gallium is typically added by wet impregnation with gallium nitrate solutions.

2. Structure: While gallium is initially deposited on the outside of zeolite crystals, under reaction conditions it becomes re-dispersed to form the active catalyst.

3. Reaction conditions: The process operates under strongly reducing conditions and high temperatures, which enable the redistribution of gallium species.

4. Industrial significance: Ga/ZSM-5 catalysts are used commercially in the Cyclar process developed by UOP and BP for converting LPG to aromatic compounds like benzene, toluene and xylenes.

The key factors contributing to the industrial significance of these catalysts are their ability to efficiently convert light alkanes to valuable aromatic products, as well as their stability under the harsh reaction conditions compared to alternatives like zinc-based catalysts.

镓改性ZSM-5催化剂的组成、结构和反应条件显著影响其在烷烃芳构化过程中的性能。具体来说:

1. 组成:由于锌的高挥发性,镓比锌更受欢迎。镓通常通过硝酸镓溶液的湿法浸渍添加。

2. 结构:虽然镓最初沉积在沸石晶体的外部,但在反应条件下,它会重新分散形成活性催化剂。

3. 反应条件:该过程在强还原条件和高温下进行,这使得镓物种能够重新分布。

4. 工业意义:Ga/ZSM-5催化剂在UOP和BP开发的Cyclar工艺中商业应用,用于将液化石油气转化为苯、甲苯和二甲苯等芳香族化合物。

这些催化剂具有工业意义的关键因素是它们能够有效地将轻烷烃转化为有价值的芳香族产品,以及与锌基催化剂等替代品相比,它们在恶劣反应条件下的稳定性。
