[1] "Three different types of supported tungsten species are present in W/HZSM-5 catalysts: isolated tetrahedral W2
4 species probably grafted to the Bro
nsted acid sites of the zeolite, octahedral polymeric species such as polytungstates and WO3 crystallites."

[2] "The relative amounts of these three types of species changes significantly with tungsten loading. At low contents of tungsten tetrahedral species predominates and they are mainly located in the channels of the zeolite. For higher loading the amount and the size of the polytungstate species increases gradually causing a decrease in the dispersion and the partial blocking up of the HZMS-5 zeolite."

[3] "Formaldehyde selectivity seems to be related to the dispersion of the tungsten oxide phase, which, in turn, is influenced by the metal loading."

[4] "It has been reported that both active oxygen ions and Bro
nsted acidic sites on HZSM-5 are active centers for methane activation"

[5] "The active centers of the partial oxidation to formaldehyde over W/HZSM-5 are in the supported tungsten oxide phase."

The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations. For W/HZSM-5 catalysts:

1. Composition: Three types of tungsten species are present - isolated tetrahedral W2
4 species, octahedral polymeric species, and WO3 crystallites. Their relative amounts change with tungsten loading.

2. Structure: At low tungsten content, tetrahedral species predominate in the zeolite channels. Higher loading increases polytungstate species, decreasing dispersion and partially blocking zeolite pores.

3. Metal loading: Influences the dispersion of the tungsten oxide phase, which in turn affects formaldehyde selectivity.

4. Active sites: Both active oxygen ions and Brønsted acidic sites on HZSM-5 activate methane, but the supported tungsten oxide phase is responsible for partial oxidation to formaldehyde.

These factors contribute to the industrial significance of such catalysts by affecting their activity, selectivity, and efficiency in alkane transformations. The ability to control these parameters allows for the optimization of catalytic performance in processes like oxidative dehydrogenation and zeolite-catalyzed reactions.

金属基催化剂的组成、结构和反应条件显著影响烷烃转化的机理和效率。对于W/HZSM-5催化剂：

1. 组成：存在三种钨物种 - 孤立的四面体W2
4物种、八面体多聚物种和WO3晶体。它们的相对含量随钨负载量的变化而变化。

2. 结构：在低钨含量时，四面体物种主要存在于沸石通道中。更高的负载量会增加多钨酸盐物种，降低分散度并部分堵塞沸石孔道。

3. 金属负载量：影响钨氧化物相的分散度，进而影响甲醛的选择性。

4. 活性位点：HZSM-5上的活性氧离子和Brønsted酸性位点都能活化甲烷，但支持的钨氧化物相负责部分氧化生成甲醛。

这些因素通过影响催化剂在烷烃转化过程中的活性、选择性和效率，contribute to了此类催化剂的工业重要性。控制这些参数的能力允许在氧化脱氢和沸石催化反应等过程中优化催化性能。
