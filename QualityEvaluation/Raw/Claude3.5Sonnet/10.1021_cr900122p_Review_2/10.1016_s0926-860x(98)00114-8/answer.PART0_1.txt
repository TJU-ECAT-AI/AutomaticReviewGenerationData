[1] "It has been demonstrated that the nature and the dispersion of the metal oxide phase have a great inuence on the catalysts behavior."

[2] "Formaldehyde selectivity seems to be dependent on metal loading and the dispersion of the surface species."

[3] "Three different types of supported tungsten species are present in W/HZSM-5 catalysts: isolated tetrahedral W2^4 species probably grafted to the Brønsted acid sites of the zeolite, octahedral polymeric species such as polytungstates and WO3 crystallites."

[4] "At low contents of tungsten tetrahedral species predominates and they are mainly located in the channels of the zeolite. For higher loading the amount and the size of the polytungstate species increases gradually causing a decrease in the dispersion and the partial blocking up of the HZMS-5 zeolite."

[5] "Formaldehyde selectivity seems to be related to the dispersion of the tungsten oxide phase, which, in turn, is inuenced by the metal loading."

The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations. For supported vanadium oxides and metal-exchanged zeolites:

1. Nature and dispersion of the metal oxide phase greatly impact catalyst behavior.

2. Metal loading affects the dispersion of surface species, which in turn influences formaldehyde selectivity.

3. In W/HZSM-5 catalysts, three types of supported tungsten species exist: isolated tetrahedral species, octahedral polymeric species, and WO3 crystallites.

4. At low tungsten contents, tetrahedral species predominate in zeolite channels. Higher loadings increase polytungstate species, decreasing dispersion and partially blocking zeolite pores.

5. Formaldehyde selectivity is related to the dispersion of the tungsten oxide phase, which is influenced by metal loading.

These factors contribute to the industrial significance of these catalysts by affecting their selectivity and efficiency in processes like oxidative dehydrogenation and zeolite-catalyzed reactions. The ability to control metal loading and dispersion allows for tuning catalyst performance for specific applications.

金属基催化剂的组成、结构和反应条件显著影响烷烃转化的机理和效率。对于负载的钒氧化物和金属交换的沸石：

1. 金属氧化物相的性质和分散度极大地影响催化剂的行为。

2. 金属负载量影响表面物种的分散度，进而影响甲醛的选择性。

3. 在W/HZSM-5催化剂中，存在三种支持的钨物种：孤立的四面体物种、八面体聚合物种和WO3晶体。

4. 在低钨含量时，四面体物种在沸石通道中占主导地位。较高的负载量会增加多钨酸盐物种，降低分散度并部分堵塞沸石孔道。

5. 甲醛选择性与钨氧化物相的分散度相关，而分散度受金属负载量的影响。

这些因素通过影响催化剂在氧化脱氢和沸石催化反应等过程中的选择性和效率，从而影响这些催化剂的工业重要性。控制金属负载量和分散度的能力允许为特定应用调整催化剂性能。
