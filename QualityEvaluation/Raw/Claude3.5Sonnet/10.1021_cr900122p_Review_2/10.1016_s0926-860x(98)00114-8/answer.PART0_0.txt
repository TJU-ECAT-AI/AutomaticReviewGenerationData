[1] "It has been demonstrated that the nature and the dispersion of the metal oxide phase have a great inuence on the catalysts behavior."

[2] "Likewise, Irusta et al. [16] demonstrated that the presence of vanadium oxide species with terminal oxygen sites (V=O) is needed for the oxidation to oxygenates whereas the presence of species without terminal V=O sites leads to the formation of complete oxidation products."

[3] "The catalytic result point out that the W/HZSM-5 catalyst is active for the partial oxidation to methane to formaldehyde. HZSM-5 zeolite shows higher activity in methane conversion but does not lead to formaldehyde production."

[4] "Formaldehyde selectivity seems to be related to the dispersion of the tungsten oxide phase, which, in turn, is inuenced by the metal loading."

[5] "Three different types of supported tungsten species are present in W/HZSM-5 catalysts: isolated tetrahedral W2^4 species probably grafted to the Bro^nsted acid sites of the zeolite, octahedral polymeric species such as polytungstates and WO3 crystallites."

The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations in processes like oxidative dehydrogenation and zeolite-catalyzed reactions. 

For supported vanadium oxides, the presence of terminal oxygen sites (V=O) is crucial for selective oxidation to oxygenates, while species without these sites lead to complete oxidation. This highlights the importance of the catalyst's surface structure in determining reaction pathways.

In metal-exchanged zeolites like W/HZSM-5, the nature and dispersion of the metal oxide phase greatly affect catalyst behavior. The distribution of different tungsten species (isolated tetrahedral, octahedral polymeric, and WO3 crystallites) changes with metal loading, influencing the catalyst's activity and selectivity. Higher dispersion of the tungsten oxide phase is associated with improved formaldehyde selectivity in methane partial oxidation.

The acidity of the zeolite support also plays a role, as demonstrated by the difference between W/HZSM-5 and W/NaZSM-5 catalysts. The Brønsted acid sites in HZSM-5 contribute to higher methane conversion but lower formaldehyde selectivity compared to the tungsten-containing catalysts.

Reaction conditions, particularly metal loading, significantly impact catalyst performance by altering the distribution and dispersion of active species. This, in turn, affects the balance between desired partial oxidation products and undesired complete oxidation products.

The industrial significance of these catalysts stems from their ability to selectively transform alkanes into more valuable products. By carefully tuning the composition, structure, and reaction conditions, it is possible to optimize catalyst performance for specific applications, potentially improving process efficiency and product yields in important industrial processes.

金属基催化剂的成分、结构和反应条件在氧化脱氢和分子筛催化反应等烷烃转化过程中对反应机理和效率有显著影响。

对于负载型钒氧化物，末端氧位点(V=O)的存在对选择性氧化生成含氧化合物至关重要，而不含这些位点的物种会导致完全氧化。这突显了催化剂表面结构在决定反应途径中的重要性。

在W/HZSM-5等金属交换分子筛中，金属氧化物相的性质和分散度极大地影响催化剂行为。不同钨物种(孤立的四面体、八面体聚合物和WO3晶体)的分布随金属负载量变化而改变，影响催化剂的活性和选择性。在甲烷部分氧化中，钨氧化物相的较高分散度与更好的甲醛选择性相关。

分子筛载体的酸性也起着重要作用，这从W/HZSM-5和W/NaZSM-5催化剂的差异中得到了证明。HZSM-5中的Brønsted酸位点与含钨催化剂相比，导致更高的甲烷转化率但更低的甲醛选择性。

反应条件，特别是金属负载量，通过改变活性物种的分布和分散度显著影响催化剂性能。这反过来又影响了所需部分氧化产物和不需要的完全氧化产物之间的平衡。

这些催化剂的工业意义在于它们能够选择性地将烷烃转化为更有价值的产品。通过仔细调整成分、结构和反应条件，可以针对特定应用优化催化剂性能，潜在地提高重要工业过程的效率和产品收率。
