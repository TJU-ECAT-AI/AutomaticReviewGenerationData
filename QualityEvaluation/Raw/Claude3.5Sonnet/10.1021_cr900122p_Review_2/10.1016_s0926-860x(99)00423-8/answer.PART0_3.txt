[1] "The catalytic activity of this new material in the MPO reaction is enhanced in comparison with the classical Mo,W/HZSM-5 impregnation catalysts."

[2] "Recently [69], catalysts based on MoO3 supported on zeolites, principally HZSM-5, were found to be active in the dehydrogenation and aromatization of methane."

[3] "Formaldehyde selectivity was dependent on the dispersion and the nature of metal oxide supported phase."

[4] "As a consequence of this reaction, and by avoiding the presence of water, isolated oxo species of molybdenum in oxidation state VI were obtained with a large dispersion."

[5] "On account of the specific activity of these isolated MoO42species, the new grafted Mo/HZSM-5 catalyst greatly improves the formaldehyde yield in the methane partial oxidation reaction with respect to those of the classical impregnated W and Mo/HZSM-5 catalysts."

The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations. For methane partial oxidation (MPO), the study shows that:

1. Catalyst composition: Mo and W supported on HZSM-5 zeolites are effective for MPO reactions. The oxidation state of Mo (VI in this case) and its dispersion on the support are crucial factors.

2. Structure: Isolated MoO42- species grafted onto HZSM-5 showed superior performance compared to classical impregnated catalysts. The high dispersion of these species contributes to improved catalytic activity.

3. Preparation method: Grafting MoO2(acac)2 onto HZSM-5 in the absence of water led to better-dispersed Mo species compared to aqueous impregnation methods.

4. Reaction specificity: The isolated Mo=O sites were found to be specific for formaldehyde production from methane.

5. Industrial significance: While the reported space time yield is still too low for industrial application, the grafted Mo/HZSM-5 catalyst showed significantly improved formaldehyde selectivity and yield compared to classical impregnated catalysts.

These factors contribute to the industrial significance of such catalysts by improving product selectivity and yield, which are crucial for process efficiency and economics in large-scale operations.

金属基催化剂的组成、结构和反应条件显著影响烷烃转化的机理和效率。对于甲烷部分氧化(MPO)，研究表明：

1. 催化剂组成：负载在HZSM-5沸石上的Mo和W对MPO反应有效。Mo的氧化态（在本例中为VI价）及其在载体上的分散度是关键因素。

2. 结构：接枝到HZSM-5上的孤立MoO42-物种比传统浸渍催化剂表现出更优越的性能。这些物种的高分散度有助于提高催化活性。

3. 制备方法：在无水条件下将MoO2(acac)2接枝到HZSM-5上，与水相浸渍法相比，可获得分散度更好的Mo物种。

4. 反应特异性：发现孤立的Mo=O位点对甲烷生成甲醛具有特异性。

5. 工业意义：虽然报告的空时产率仍然太低，不适合工业应用，但接枝的Mo/HZSM-5催化剂与传统浸渍催化剂相比，显著提高了甲醛的选择性和产率。

这些因素通过提高产品选择性和产率来提升此类催化剂的工业意义，这对大规模操作的工艺效率和经济性至关重要。
