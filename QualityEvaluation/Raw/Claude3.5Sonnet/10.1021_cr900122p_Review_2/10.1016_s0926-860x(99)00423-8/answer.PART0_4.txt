[1] "The authors have reported the partial oxidation of methane to formaldehyde over W and Mo/HZSM-5 catalysts prepared by conventional aqueous impregnation [13,14]. It was shown that three different types of metal oxide species are present in these catalysts, the relative amount of each one varying with the metal loading: tetrahedral monomeric species, octahedral polymeric species and metal oxide crystallites."

[2] "The weakness of the CH bond of methane, caused by distortion of the methane molecule through its interaction with the zeolite surface, has been proposed as the first step in the methane activation mechanism [10]."

[3] "Formaldehyde selectivity was dependent on the dispersion and the nature of metal oxide supported phase."

[4] "A more effective route for the preparation of highly dispersed molybdenum oxo species on the surface has resulted from the grafting method. This method consists of the formation of chemical bonds between the metal and the support, usually by reaction of one or more ligands in a metal complex with reactive surface sites, such as acidic silanols [1820]."

[5] "The unique products obtained in the partial oxidation of methane over the grafted Mo/HZSM-5 catalyst (corresponding to Mo(1.36)) were formaldehyde, carbon oxides (CO and CO2) and H2O."

[6] "Several authors have reported the specificity of M=O and MOM sites (M: Mo, V) in the production of HCOH and carbon oxides, respectively, from methane over MoO3 and V2O5 silica-supported catalysts [32,33,3638]."

The composition, structure, and reaction conditions of metal-based catalysts significantly influence the mechanisms and efficiency of alkane transformations in processes like oxidative dehydrogenation and zeolite-catalyzed reactions. 

For metal-exchanged zeolites, the nature and dispersion of the metal oxide species on the support play a crucial role. In W and Mo/HZSM-5 catalysts, three types of metal oxide species are present: tetrahedral monomeric species, octahedral polymeric species, and metal oxide crystallites. The relative amounts of these species vary with metal loading, affecting catalyst performance.

The zeolite support itself contributes to the reaction mechanism. The interaction between methane and the zeolite surface causes distortion of the CH bond, which is proposed as the initial step in methane activation.

The preparation method of the catalyst greatly influences its structure and performance. Grafting methods, which form chemical bonds between the metal and support, produce highly dispersed metal oxo species on the surface. This results in improved catalyst performance compared to conventional aqueous impregnation methods.

The specific nature of metal sites affects product selectivity. M=O sites (where M is Mo or V) are reported to be specific for formaldehyde production, while MOM sites tend to produce carbon oxides.

Reaction conditions also play a role. In the partial oxidation of methane over grafted Mo/HZSM-5 catalysts, the main products are formaldehyde, carbon oxides, and water.

These factors contribute to the industrial significance of these catalysts by influencing their activity, selectivity, and stability. The ability to control these parameters through catalyst design and preparation methods allows for the development of more efficient and selective catalysts for industrial alkane transformation processes.

金属基催化剂的组成、结构和反应条件显著影响烷烃转化过程中的机理和效率，尤其是在氧化脱氢和沸石催化反应等过程中。

对于金属交换沸石，金属氧化物物种在载体上的性质和分散度起着至关重要的作用。在W和Mo/HZSM-5催化剂中，存在三种类型的金属氧化物物种：四面体单体物种、八面体聚合物种和金属氧化物晶体。这些物种的相对含量随金属负载量的变化而变化，影响催化剂的性能。

沸石载体本身也对反应机理有贡献。甲烷与沸石表面的相互作用导致CH键的扭曲，这被认为是甲烷活化的初始步骤。

催化剂的制备方法极大地影响其结构和性能。通过在金属和载体之间形成化学键的接枝方法可以在表面产生高度分散的金属氧物种。与传统的水相浸渍方法相比，这种方法可以改善催化剂的性能。

金属位点的特定性质影响产物选择性。据报道，M=O位点（其中M为Mo或V）特异性地产生甲醛，而MOM位点倾向于产生碳氧化物。

反应条件也起着重要作用。在接枝Mo/HZSM-5催化剂上进行甲烷部分氧化时，主要产物是甲醛、碳氧化物和水。

这些因素通过影响催化剂的活性、选择性和稳定性，对其工业意义做出了贡献。通过催化剂设计和制备方法控制这些参数的能力，使得可以开发出更高效、更具选择性的工业烷烃转化过程催化剂。
