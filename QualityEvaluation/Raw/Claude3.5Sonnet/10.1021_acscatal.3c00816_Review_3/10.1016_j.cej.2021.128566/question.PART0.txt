Ultrafast surfactant-templating of *BEA zeolite: An efficient catalyst for the cracking of polyethylene pyrolysis vapours
Abstract
Introducing intracrystalline mesoporosity to zeolites is an effective way to reduce their diffusion limitations and enhancing their catalytic performance in reactions where large molecules are involved. The emergence of the so-called surfactant-templating technique has enriched the toolbox of methods to prepare mesoporous zeolites, in which amphiphilic molecules are used to assist in and direct the generation of mesopores in a pre-existing zeolite structure under alkaline conditions. We herein present ultrafast surfactant-templating of *BEA zeolite, which is achieved in just a few minutes with a tubular reactor that features fast heating. Two *BEA zeolites of the same Si/Al ratio, but differing in crystal size, are employed to demonstrate the concept. Tuning the interplay between the surfactant concentration and the alkalinity leads to the ultrafast generation of mesoporosity in the *BEA zeolite with the larger crystal size (BEA (L)) in 5 min; while it fails to generate uniform mesopores to the *BEA zeolite with the smaller crystal size (BEA (S)) under otherwise identical conditions. The ultrafast surfactant-templating of *BEA (S) is achieved only when it is partially dealuminated through a pre-treatment with acid. Our results provide new insights on the synergetic effect between the surfactant and the base that governs the surfactant-templating process and on how to produce intracrystalline mesoporosity with narrow pore size distribution under ultrafast conditions (2 min). The resultant mesoporous *BEA zeolites have been tested in the catalytic cracking of the vapours produced by pyrolyzing low-density polyethylene, a promising reaction for converting waste plastics into fuels. Improved selectivity towards aromatic hydrocarbons and light olefins is observed as a result of enhanced accessibility and availability of active sites, validating the superiority of the surfactant-templated *BEA zeolites.

1. Introduction
Zeolites are crystalline microporous aluminosilicate materials, well known for their numerous industrial applications in catalysis, adsorption and ion-exchange
[1]
,
[2]
,
[3]
,
[4]
. Alkyltrimethylammonium surfactants (CnH2n+1-(CH3)3NBr) with different alkyl chain lengths can be used to produce intracrystalline mesoporosity in zeolites whereas organosilanes are used to reduce the crystal size of the zeolite
[5]
,
[6]
,
[7]
. Within the last decade, surfactant-templating has emerged as a versatile and convenient technique to produce uniform intracrsytalline mesoporosity in zeolites, due to its scalability, cost-efficiency, and ability to control both the size and amount of mesopores in the zeolite, while maintaining its key properties
[8]
. During this post-synthesis treatment, the surfactant acts as porogen creating the mesopores, the size of which corresponds to the length of the surfactant employed
[9]
,
[10]
,
[11]
,
[12]
. Contrarily, one of the widely adopted post-synthesis treatment techniques referred to desilication relies on the removal of silicon from the zeolite framework to generate mesopores
[13]
. The desilication process depends on several factors, but pH plays a decisive role in controlling the extent of the silica removed and therefore the mesoporosity created. Quite importantly, this method does not allow for a precise control of mesopores size or connectivity because it relies on the unselective extraction of silicon, which also causes significant mass losses. Owing to the inherent nature of the desilication process, loss in the crystallinity, Si/Al ratio, and reduction in the hydrothermal stability of the zeolite is inevitable. Unlike the desilication, the surfactant-templating process is able to preserve these key properties of the zeolite, while generating well-control mesoporosity throughout the whole zeolite crystals
[11]
,
[12]
.
The development of controlled intracrystalline mesoporosity in *BEA zeolite is a challenging task. Complex intergrowth of two polymorphs (polymorphs A and B) in *BEA zeolite crystalline structure results in the relatively low stability of tetrahedrally coordinated aluminium
[14]
. Hence, desilication of the *BEA zeolite in the Si/Al window of 1550 (identified as optimum for other frameworks such as MFI, FAU or MOR) could lead to excessive Si extraction. Groen et al. studied the effect of desilication on *BEA topology, which resulted in the creation of mesopores under mild alkaline conditions; however, product yield and intrinsic properties were significantly sacrificed
[15]
. Recent studies showed the decrease in the strength of active sites in the *BEA zeolite upon desilication, degraded its performance as a cracking catalyst
[16]
,
[17]
. Whereas, the inclusion of surfactants such as CTAB (cetyltrimethylammonium bromide) significantly improved the stability of *BEA zeolite under the same alkaline conditions
[7]
,
[17]
,
[18]
. Recent studies demostrated the successful generation of mesoprosity in *BEA zeolite through surfactant templating
[10]
,
[11]
,
[19]
. The development of highly interconnected mesopores with a well-defined pore size distribution (PSD) is of paramount importance to attain the selectivity of the desired product under catalytic reactions.
Garca-Martinez et al systematically investigated the generation of intracrystalline mesoporosity in the surfactant containing alkaline solution and proposed the mechanism of surfactant-templating
[20]
,
[21]
,
[22]
. The surfactant-templating mechanism relies on the diffusion of surfactant cations such as CTA+ into the pores of zeolites, driven by the electrostatic attraction towards negative charged SiO- species. The SiO- species are created as a result of SiOSi bond cleavage in a mildly alkaline environment. The surfactant molecules assemble into micelles and hence directs the formation of uniform mesopores, the size of which is governed by chain length of the surfactant. Its worth noting that CTAB has also been used as a mesoporogen in the direct synthesis of hierarchical zeolites such as *BEA zeolite
[23]
. Nevertheless, it often requires a delicate control over the synthesis parameters, and this method often leads to a broad PSD and even the formation of amorphous matters.
Recently, the Okubo group demonstrated the ultrafast synthesis of a series of zeolitic materials such as AlPO4-5, SSZ-13, Silicalite-1, MOR, ERI, and *BEA zeolite, on the order of minutes at high temperatures
[24]
,
[25]
,
[26]
,
[27]
,
[28]
,
[29]
,
[30]
,
[31]
. A feature of the strategy is the rapid heating to high temperatures to avoid the thermal lag, which in combination with aging and seeding can greatly accelerate the crystallization rate of zeolites. Rapid heating is achieved in a stainless-steel tubular reactor in a preheated oil bath as a heating medium. During the temperature ramping step, many reactions take place, particularly in this case, decomposition and undesired reactions of quaternary ammonium salt can dominate in slow heating
[6]
,
[32]
. While rapid heating in the tubular reactor can avoid such negative effects. It is of foremost importance to carefully tune the composition of starting gel mixture and adjust the synthesis temperature that is usually higher than the conventional synthesis process
[28]
.
In this study, we aim to introduce the ultrafast synthesis concept to the preparation of *BEA zeolite with intracrystalline mesoporosity through surfactant-templating and hence to reduce the diffusional limitations that the microporous structure would impose on large molecules. When it comes to the catalytic applications of zeolites where heavy hydrocarbon molecules are involved, mass transport limitation not only restricts the access to the active sites but also leads to severe coke formation that further blocks the micropores. In particular, 12-membered ring zeolites (such as FAU and *BEA) could experience condensation of heavy molecules inside the cage connecting micropores, which results in higher coke formation than that in the case of 10-membered ring MFI zeolite
[33]
. While tailoring the mesoporous structure of 12-membered ring zeolites, it is worth enhancing the accessibility and availability of active sites. Availability of reaction sites can be assured by preserving the intrinsic properties (such as Si/Al ratio, crystallinity, acidity, and morphology) of zeolites during the development of the mesoporous structure; whereas accessibility can be improved by creating the uniform mesopores
[34]
,
[35]
,
[36]
. Therefore, the catalytic performance of surfactant- templated *BEA zeolite is studied for the cracking of the vapours produced by the pyrolysis of low-density polyethylene (LDPE).
Herein, we report the successful surfactant-templating of *BEA zeolite in just 2 min. The ultrafast surfactant-templating of *BEA zeolite was achieved in the tubular reactor that allowed fast heating to high temperature. We found that by judiciously adjusting both the CTAB/Si ratio and the NaOH concentration uniform intracrystalline mesoporosity could be obtained, whereas desilication took place in the absence of CTAB, causing significant damage to the zeolite structure as well as PSD. Furthermore, we investigated the ultrafast surfactant-templating with two *BEA zeolites, which had similar Si/Al ratios but different texture properties and crystal size. Ultrafast surfactant-templating was achieved in one *BEA zeolite by directly tuning the interplay between the surfactant concentration and the alkalinity, while prior dealumination was required for the successful surfactant-templating of the other *BEA zeolite. The results reveal that the synergetic effect between the surfactant-templating condition and the intrinsic connectivity governs the reorganization of the zeolite structure. We also demonstrate that the resultant *BEA zeolites with intracrystalline mesopores can enhance aromatics selectivity as well as inhibit coke formation in the catalytic cracking of LDPE pyrolysis vapours.
2. Experimental procedures
2.1. Material
Beta 931HOA (H+ form) and Beta 930NHA (NH4+ form) zeolites with molar Si/Al ratio (indicated by suppliers) 14 and 13.5 respectively, were provided by Tosoh Corporation, Japan. Cetyltriethylammonium Bromide, CTAB (98%), Sodium Hydroxide, NaOH (pellets) were purchased from Fujifilm Wako Pure chemical.
2.2. Surfactant-templating of *BEA zeolites
Beta 931HOA and Beta 930NHA zeolites (labelled as BEA (L)-parent and BEA (S)-parent) were first calcined at 550 C for 5 h before any further modification. FE-SEM confirmed the crystal size and morphology of two *BEA (
Fig. S1
). In a typical run, CTAB was first dissolved in the 4 wt% aqueous solution of NaOH. To this solution, 0.18 g of BEA (L) or BEA (S) zeolite was added and then stirred at 350 rpm for 30 min. The initial composition of the solution was adjusted at 1 SiO2: 0.070.14 NaOH: 0.0820.1 CTAB: 63 H2O. Different compositions were obtained by varying CTAB/Si molar ratio from 0.03 to 0.1 and NaOH concentrations from (0.251.5 mol L1). Subsequently, the mixture was transferred to a stainless-steel tubular reactor (see
Fig. S2
for reactor configuration)
[37]
. The preheated oil bath at a set temperature of 200 C was used as a heating medium, in which the tubular reactor was heated for a certain period of time (2 min, 5 min or 15 min). The reactor was then quenched in the ice-cold water at 5 C to stop the reaction immediately. The resultant slurry was recovered and washed with de-ionized water several times to neutralise the pH. The same procedure was applied for both the zeolites. For comparison purpose, BEA (L)-parent was also treated in an autoclave for 4 h and 8 h in a conventional oven at two varying temperatures (150 C and 200 C). The optimised samples were named as BEA (L)-meso and BEA (S)-meso, used for the further characterisations and catalytic evaluation.
The effect of surfactant-templating was also studied on a dealuminated sample at a higher Si/Al molar ratio. In a typical run, BEA (S)-parent was treated with a 0.5 M H2SO4 solution for 2 h at room temperature. The resultant solution was dried at 100 C overnight, followed by the calcination at 550 C for 5 h. The resultant powder was labelled as BEA (S)-DA and followed the same protocol for post-synthesis treatment, discussed above.
Final powder samples were converted into the protonic form (H+ form) through ion-exchange with 2 M ammonium nitrate solution. In a typical run, 1 g of powder zeolite was suspended in 20 mL of 2 M ammonium nitrate solution (Sigma Aldrich) followed by the heating at 80 C for 3 h. The solution was centrifuged to remove the solvent, and the ion-exchange procedure was repeated thrice. The final solution was washed with de-ionised water several times to bring down the pH of the solvent at 7. The powder obtained in NH4+ form was then dried overnight and calcined at 550 C to obtain the H+ form of the zeolite.
2.3. Material characterisation
X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) analysis was conducted to determine the crystallinity and change in the structure of zeolites after post-synthesis treatment. XRD patterns were obtained on Rigaku Ultima IV diffractometer using Cu kα radiation at 4 kV, 40 mA (λ = 0.15406 nm) at the scanning velocity of 4/min in the 5 < 2θ < 50 range. Texture properties were characterised by nitrogen gas adsorptiondesorption at 77 K in a Quantachrome Autosorb-iQ2 instrument. Prior to the analysis, samples were outgassed at 350 C for 4 h under vacuum. The non-linear density functional theory model (NL-DFT, adsorption branch of the isotherm) was employed to formulate PSD curves, as described elsewhere
[38]
. The total pore volume, Vt was calculated at the relative pressure of 0.95. The micropore volumes of all the samples, Vmicro were determined from the cumulative pore volume plot at 2 nm obtained using the adsorption branch of isotherm and applying the NL-DFT model. The mesopore volume, Vmeso was calculated by subtracting the Vmicro from Vt. Chemical compositions (Si and Al content) of the parent and treated samples were measured using inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectrometry (ICP-AES) technique. Samples were first dissolved in hydrofluoric acid and diluted with Milli-Q ultra-pure before their analysis by ICP in a iCAP DUO-6300 (Thermo Fisher Scientific) instrument. The crystal morphology of the samples was observed using a field emission scanning electron microscope (JSM-7000F, JEOL Japan) at an accelerating voltage of 10 keV. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) observations were carried out using a JEM 2010 transmission electron microscope (JEOL, Japan) operated at 200 keV. Investigation of the interactions and degradation of the surfactant during the post-synthesis treatment process was carried out by Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and reported as differential thermogravimetry (DTG) curve and weight loss profiles. TG-DTG experiments were performed on a Rigaku PU 4 K instrument from 30 C to 800 C at the heating rate of 10 C min1 under the flow of mixed gas (10 vol% O2 and 90 vol% He). The surface acidity of final zeolite catalysts in its protonic form was assessed by ammonia temperature-programmed desorption (NH3-TPD) procedure. Micromertics 2910 (TPD) AutoChem instrument was programmed to detect NH3 desorption peaks qualitatively coupled with a thermal conductivity detector. A sample was degassed under helium flow for 1 h at 170 C. Subsequently, 5% NH3 in helium was used to adsorb ammonia and equilibrium was maintained at 100 C. Physisorbed ammonia was removed by flowing helium for 1 h at room temperature. Finally, chemisorbed ammonia was removed by elevating the temperature to 700 C at rate of 10 C min1, which was detected by TCD. 27Al and 29Si nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) were conducted using Bruker Avance 300, CP MAS 78.18 MHz for Al and 59.6 MHz for Si (both at 10 KHz spinning rate).
2.4. Catalytic testing
The LDPE pyrolysis experiments were carried out in a two-stage fixed bed reactor. Feed (LDPE) was loaded and sealed in the first stage pyrolysis chamber. The first stage chamber was connected to the second stage catalytic chamber through a pyrolytic gas transfer line. In a second chamber, the powder zeolite catalyst was placed between two layers of quartz wool, one at the top and one at the bottom. The system was purged with N2 for 30 min before the first stage temperature was ramped to 500 C at the heating rate of 10 C min1 and catalyst bed temperature was maintained at 350 C. The temperature of the pyrolysis chamber (first stage) was set according to the thermal degradation temperature of LDPE, as measured by TGA. The temperature of the catalytic bed was optimised to achieve maximum conversion and to minimise coke formation. (see
Supplementary Fig. S3
for schematic and
Table S1
for reactor operating parameters). The pyrolysis gases, mainly paraffin and olefin, passed through the second chamber underwent catalytic cracking over *BEA zeolite catalysts. Gases from the catalytic chamber were condensed at 0 C, while non-condensable gases were collected in a gas bag for further analysis. Liquid and gas samples were collected for 30 min at the temperature range between 350 and 500 C.
The liquid product was analysed in an Agilent 6890 gas chromatograph (GC) interfaced with an Agilent 5973 Mass selective detector (MS). A DB-5MS column (30 m length, 0.25 mm internal diameter, 0.25 M film) was used for the separation of analytes (samples). MS data were collected in scan mode, with a scanning range of m/z 30550. The transfer line temperature and MS source temperature were set to 280 C and 230 C respectively, to prevent condensation of compounds from the gas phase. The carrier gas was helium with a constant flow rate of 1 mL/min, and the injector temperature was 250 C. The oven temperature program began at 50 C, with a 3-minute hold. Then, a heating ramp rate of 12 C/min was applied to increase the oven temperature to 300 C, where it was held isothermally for 5 min. The injection volume was 1 L.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Ultrafast surfactant-templating of *BEA (L) in the tubular reactor
The surfactant-templating process involves three distinctive steps: 1) the cleavage of Si-O-Si bonds, 2) the electrostatic attraction of the CTA+ cations by the Si-O- charges in the zeolite, and 3) rearrangement of crystal structure to accommodate the micelles. Linares et al studied the kinetics of the different steps involved in the surfactant-templating of USY zeolite to determine the activation energy by in-situ XRD
[39]
. It was observed that the formation of Si-O- species by the reaction of Si-O-Si with OH ions shows an apparent activation energy of 35 kJ/mol. Whereas, CTA+ diffusion through the zeolite pores presented a lower apparent activation energy (29 kJ/mol). The activation energy of the whole process was estimated to be 45 kJ/mol and 43 kJ/mol from in situ XRD and ex situ gas adsorption, respectively
[39]
. Notably, the activation energy for the crystallisation process of USY was reported around 4965 kJ/mol elsewhere
[40]
,
[41]
. This implies that the activation energy of surfactant-templating is comparable to that of the crystallisation of the USY zeolite. Similarly, the apparent activation energies of the crystallisation and nucleation of *BEA zeolite using tetraethylammonium bromide were reported to be 45 kJ/mol and 54 kJ/mol, respectively
[42]
. These studies suggest that the surfactant-templating of zeolites is energetically feasible under the conditions typically used for the synthesis of zeolites.
Herein, we demonstrate a new strategy (called as ultrafast surfactant-templating) that combines the ultrafast synthesis technique and the surfactant-templating in order to efficiently induce large amounts of uniform intracrystalline mesoporosity into *BEA zeolite in just a few minutes. The sample treated for 5 min showed optimum results; therefore, it was selected for further investigation (
Fig. S4
). To gain additional insight on the role of the treatment conditions on the properties of the final materials, BEA (L) was treated at different CTAB/Si ratios and NaOH concentrations at 150200 C for 4 h and 2 h in the conventional oven in an autoclave (
Fig. S5
). Those materials produced using a CTAB/Si ratio of 0.08 and 1 mol/L NaOH yielded a narrower PSD centred at 4 nm as compared to other concentrations of CTAB and NaOH. Therefore, these conditions were selected as starting point for the experiments in the tubular reactor.
As shown in
Fig. S5
the conventional slow heating procedure produced a much broader PSD than the ultrafast technique carried out at 200 C for 5 min in an oil bath (BEA (L)-meso). This observation is likely due to some undesired reactions occurring during slow temperature ramping step (conventional oven), such as the partial decomposition of the surfactant that may occur by exposing it to a high temperature for a long period of time. Quaternary ammonium-based surfactants, such as CTAB, undergo trimethylamine elimination through Hofmann degradation
[28]
,
[43]
. Hence, ultrafast heating at 200 C surpassed CTAB decomposition step which was inevitable during the slow heating.
BEA (L), with a Si/Al molar ratio of 14 and a crystal size ranging from 100 to 300 nm was treated under different concentrations of CTAB and NaOH to investigate the effect of surfactant-templating in alkaline solution. The CTAB is an ideal molecule to introduce mesoporosity in zeolites by surfactant-templating because 1) its alkyl chain length produces well-formed micelles, which yields mesopores in the range of 4 nm pore diameter, and 2) its small head group (trimethylamine) allows for easy diffusion of the surfactant into the BEA pores.
Fig. 1
a shows the PSD of BEA (L) after ultrafast surfactant-templating for 5 min at different CTAB/Si molar ratio (0.030.1) and a fixed NaOH concentration of 1 mol L1. The mesopores produced have an average diameter of ca. 4 nm, whereas, the amount of those mesopores increases with the increase in the concentration of CTAB. Maximum mesopore volume was achieved for an optimum CTAB/Si molar ratio of 0.08 and a NaOH concentration of 1 mol L1. The sample produced using these conditions was denoted as BEA (L)-meso. It is worth mentioning that Vmeso of BEA (L)-meso increased to 0.31 cm3 g1 with preserved Vmicro (0.23 cm3 g1). The significant loss in Vmicro (0.17 cm3 g1) does not compensates for the small increase in Vmeso (0.15 cm3 g1) of BEA(L)-desilicated indicates the superiority of post surfactant-templating over desilication method.

b. shows the N2 sorption isotherms at 77 K of surfactant-templated BEA (L) at varying CTAB/Si ratios. The isotherms of both the BEA (L)-parent and the desilicated samples (without surfactant) have been added for comparison purposes. The BEA (L)-parent sample exhibited a type I isotherm, which is characteristic of microporous materials (Vmicro = 0.24 cm3 g1, Vmeso = 0.04 cm3 g1). The desilicated sample BEA (L) (without CTAB) showed a typical isotherm of a partially dissolved zeolite, caused by Si extraction from the framework by the base, which leads to a significant loss of microporosity. However, the surfactant-templated *BEA zeolite retained much more of the original micropore volume and displays a sharp N2 uptake at ca. P/P0 = 0.4, which revealed the formation of well-defined mesopores of a uniform size. Two interesting observations from N2 physisorption studies further confirmed the important role of CTAB in preserving the structural integrity of the zeolite during the surfactant-templating treatment:
1)
the increase in the CTAB/Si ratio resulted in a significant boost in the total pore volume (Vt = 0.54 cm3 g1) as compared to both the desilicated (Vt = 0.33 cm3 g1) and BEA (L)-parent (Vt = 0.28 cm3 g1) (

the desilicated BEA (L) showed a continuous N2 uptake at P/P0 > 0.8, which indicates the formation of large pores and intraparticle voids.
On the contrary, BEA (L)-meso (CTAB/Si 0.08, NaOH 1 mol L1) showed uniform mesopore formation, indicating the formation of well-defined mesopores resulting from the rearrangement of the zeolite crystal during surfactant-templating around the surfactant micelles. The development of intracrystalline mesoporosity via surfactant-templating in BEA (L)-meso was further confirmed by TEM analysis (
Fig. 1
.g). The XRD patterns of the BEA zeolite before and after surfactant-templating (
Fig. 1
c) clearly shows that a large amount of mesoporosity (0.31 cm3 g1) can be introduced via this method while preserving the crystalline structure of the zeolite. The impact of surfactant-templating on the structure of the BEA(L) zeolite was further studied using 13C, 29Si and 27Al solid-state NMR.
The 13C NMR spectrum of the BEA (L)-meso sample shows the interactions of CTAB with *BEA zeolite structure after the surfactant-templating treatment. For comparison purposes, the spectrum of a physical mixture of BEA (L)-parent and CTAB (mixed in same molar ratio as BEA (L)-meso) is also included in
Fig. 1
d. Powder crystalline CTAB showed the resonance peaks at 32 (C2), 30 (C13-14), 27 (C15) and 24 ppm (C16), which is consistent with the 13C NMR spectrum of the physical mixture of BEA (L) and CTAB. Due to the interactions of CTA+ with zeolite structure in the BEA (L)-meso sample, the intensity of the resonance peak at 40 ppm decreased and broadened. Moreover, a resonance peak at 54 ppm appeared (associated with the carbons C17-C19 in (CH3(CH2)14 N(CH3)2)) is the product of the decomposition of CTAB
[44]
. These results provide strong evidence of the interaction between the CTA+ and the zeolite framework, as previously suggested elsewhere
[21]
.
To gain further insight into the changes in the Si and Al structural environments during surfactant-templating, 27Al and 29Si solid-state NMR of BEA (L)-parent and -meso were performed (
Fig. 1
e, f). 27Al MAS NMR spectra of these two zeolites show two distinctive peaks at around 0 ppm and 50 ppm corresponding to extra framework aluminium EFAL (octahedrally coordinated) and framework aluminium (tetrahedrally coordinated) respectively
[45]
. The decrease in the intensity of the peak due to EFAL together with the increase in the peak related to framework aluminium confirms that the structure rearrangement took place during the surfactant-templating treatment to accommodate the mesoporosity. The healing of defects present in the original zeolite was previously reported elsewhere
[21]
. The solid-state 29Si MAS NMR spectra were yielded two signals attributed to 1) Q4(0Al) silicon species (Si(OSi)4) at chemical shift around 112 ppm, and 2) Q4 (1Al) silicon species (Si(OSi)3(OH)) at around 106 ppm. The changes in the peak intensities corresponding to the Q4 (0Al) and Q4 (1Al) provide additional evidence of the aforementioned rearrangement of the zeolite. The surfactant-templated *BEA contained one shoulder at 116 ppm, which is attributed to Q4 (0Al), but at different T sites
[46]
. This result also suggests the reorganization of zeolite structure that occurs during the formation of the mesopores.
Fig. 2
a and b show that at a low concentration of NaOH (0.25 mol L-1, CTAB/ratio 0.08), a broad PSD was obtained, while when using the optimised NaOH concentration (1 mol L-1) a much narrower PSD centred at 4 nm was observed. The higher the OH concentration the larger number of SiO- sites are formed, which can attract more CTA+ ions. Hence, if enough CTAB is available, the initial OH concentration determines the amount of mesoporosity that can be formed. If too much NaOH is used (1.5 mol L-1), a shift in the PSD from 4 to 5 nm is observed (
Fig. 2
a), which suggests some CTAB deficit or the difficulty of this surfactant to interact with the zeolite at a high pH, as also evidenced by the drop in microporosity (
Fig. 2
b). As shown in
Fig. 2
c, the micropore volume of the zeolite decreases with the NaOH concentration, whereas the mesopores volume increases up to a value of Vmeso = 0.31 cm3 g1) for a NaOH concentration of 1.5 mol L-1. It is worth mentioning that the Si/Al ratio of the surfactant-templated zeolites remained constant after this treatment, even for those samples with very high mesopores volumes. However, the Si/Al ratio of the desilicated zeolite dropped to a value of 9.3, as determined by ICP-AES (
Table 1
).
Fig. 2
d represents the amount of CTAB that is inside the zeolite after the surfactant-templating process versus the NaOH concentration used in this treatment. The amount of CTAB that is inside the zeolite after the surfactant-templating treatment was determined by TGA. More specifically, the DTG profiles of the samples produced at a fixed CTAB/Si ratio of 0.08 and different NaOH concentrations showed three weight loss zones, the first one corresponding to CTA+ associated to the zeolite (
Fig. S7
b). On the contrary, only one peak was observed when the sample was treated in the absence of NaOH. This sample, obviously, didnt show any surfactant-templated mesoporosity (see the

3.2. Ultrafast surfactant-templating of *BEA (S)
This section deals with the effect of surfactant-templating on BEA (S), which is formed by agglomerated crystals smaller than100 nm. BEA (S) parent shows significant interparticle condensation, as evidence by its isotherm (see
Fig S8
), and a broad PSD between 3 nm and 10 nm size (
Fig. 3
a). The same surfactant- templating procedure that was described before was employed on BEA (S) to study the impact of crystal size on the formation of surfactant induced mesoporous structure. Ideally, under the optimised concentration of CTAB and NaOH, a uniform pore size of 4 nm (depending on the surfactant chain length) should be obtained. However, unlike BEA (L), the PSD of BEA (S) (
Fig. 3
a) treated at different CTAB/Si ratios and at a fixed NaOH concentration of 0.5 mol L-1 showed two zones in its PSD profiles. Two peaks around 4 nm and 7 nm emerged at a CTAB/Si ratio 0.08. With the increase in the CTAB/Si ratio to 0.12, a prominent peak at 4 nm appeared, whereas the peak at 7 nm decreased in intensity. Moreover, when the NaOH concentration was increased to 1.5 mol L-1, the peak at 4 nm became larger and narrower, but also a broad shoulder centred at 10 nm developed (
Fig. 3
b). This was attributed to the dominated effect of desilication, which was confirmed by a decrease in Si/Al ratio to 9.3 (
Table 2
). The total pore volume of this sample increased to the striking value of 0.73 cm3 g1 (Sext = 547 m2 g1) as compared to 0.46 cm3 g1 in BEA (S)-parent. 27Al NMR and 29Si NMR analysis (
Fig. 3
c and 3d) showed a decrease in intensity of the peak at δ = 0 ppm, which is associated with octahedrally coordinated aluminium and a sharp increase in the peak at δ = 50 ppm, which corresponds to tetrahedrally coordinated aluminium. The 29Si NMR spectrum of the BEA (S)-meso sample showed an increase in the Q4(1Al) peak intensity around 105 ppm attributed to the formation of silanol nest due to extraction of framework aluminium. Due to the different initial aluminium state and morphology, two *BEA zeolites (BEA (L) and BEA (S)) with same Si/Al ratio showed distinctively different behaviour when treated under same conditions. Therefore, in order to understand the role and impact of aluminium on the surfactant-templating of *BEA zeolites, the BEA (S) sample was dealuminated before this post-synthesis treatment.

3.3. Ultrafast surfactant-templating of *BEA (S) after its partial dealumination
BEA (S) was dealuminated under acidic conditions (treated with 0.5 M H2SO4 Sol for 2 h at room temperature) to increase its Si/Al to 38. Dealuminated BEA (S) samples labelled as BEA (S)-DA were treated under the same condition as BEA (S).
Fig. 4
a shows the crystallinity of BEA (S) after dealumination, desilication and surfactant-templating. The dealuminated sample showed an increase in the Vt and Sext up to 0.59 cm g1 and 555 m2 g1, respectively (
Table 2
). Partial removal of aluminium from the zeolite framework resulted in the creation of mesopores, as evidenced by the N2 uptake at ca. P/P0 = 0.6 (
Fig. 4
d) and the broad peak centred around 8 nm in the PSD plot, see
Fig. 4
f) whereas the increase in Vmicro indicates the removal of structural defects or debris blocking the micropores. Hence, in this case, the acid treatment decreased the total aluminium content in the BEA (S) sample yielding a higher bulk Si/Al ratio, which assured the minimal effect of Al during the surfactant-templating process. First, BEA (S)-DA was desilicated (treatment without CTAB at a NaOH conc. of 0.5 mol L-1) under the same conditions (temperature 200 C, time 5 min) in the tubular reactor to confirm the structure sensitivity of 12-membered ring zeolite with Si/Al > 10 to the alkaline media. XRD analysis (
Fig. 4
a) showed the complete collapse of the structure of BEA (S)-DA upon desilication. This observation provides additional evidence about the uncontrolled leaching of Si from the framework of a zeolite with a high Si/Al ratio. On the contrary, surfactant-templated BEA (S)-DA presented a minimal variation in Si/Al ratio i.e.  3, which further confirms the protective role of CTAB (

Fig. 4
c shows the PSD of the samples prepared with increasing CTAB/Si ratios (0.030.1) at constant NaOH concentration (0.5 mol L-1). Noticeably, the introduction of CTAB at a fixed NaOH concentration yields a sharp PSD around 4 nm, instead of the broad distribution observed in BEA (S) and BEA (S)-DA, which range from 3 nm to 10 nm. At CTAB/Si = 0.08, a maximum pore volume of 0.68 cm g1 was achieved, to which contributed a remarkably high Vmeso = 0.45 cm g1 and approximately the same Vmicro = 0.22 cm g1 (
Fig. 4
c). The well-defined peak centred at 4 nm in the PSD of surfactant-templated BEA (S)-DA are very similar to peaks in the PSD of the samples produced from the large crystal zeolite BEA (L), which confirms the templating role of the surfactant. Similarly, the N2 isotherms of the surfactant-templated BEA (S)-DA samples showed a sharp uptake around P/P0 = 0.4, previously observed in the case of the large crystal zeolite BEA (L) (
Fig. 4
d). The hysteresis loop found in the isotherms of the BEA (S) and BEA (S)-DA samples at around P/P0 = 0.8 are due to large mesopores. This feature is completely vanished in BEA (S)-DA-meso, which confirms the healing effect a characteristic of the surfactant-templating method. The TEM image of the BEA (S)-DA-meso sample confirmed the formation of well-developed intracrystalline mesoporosity in this zeolite (
Fig. 4
e). The combined effect of surfactant and alkalinity was again studied by varying NaOH concentration in the synthesis mixture (
Fig. 4
f). It is evident that even at a low concentration of NaOH, the BEA (S)-DA was restructured to form mesopores with an average pore size of 4 nm. With the increase in NaOH concentration, the mesopore volume progressively increased, while the pore size remained constant at 4 nm. The 27Al and 29Si NMR spectra of the BEA (S)-DA and DA-meso samples convincingly showed the reorganisation of aluminium and silicon structure that is one of the features of the surfactant-templating process (
Fig. 4
g, h).
4. Catalytic assessment of the surfactant-templated *BEA zeolites
The catalytic cracking of the vapours produced by the pyrolysis of LDPE was selected as a model reaction to evaluate the surfactant-templated *BEA zeolites. This reaction is of foremost interest as LDPE is the main constituent of waste plastics. Moreover, the pyrolysis of LDPE produces vapours containing a wide range of straight-chain hydrocarbons ranging from C5-C20. The LDPE pyrolysis vapours has been used as a feed to produce aromatic hydrocarbons, and thus improve the quality of the oil, by using the zeolites reported in this study. Therefore, LDPE was first pyrolyzed (thermal treatment in an inert atmosphere) at 500 C in a two-stage fixed bed reactor. The vapours, mainly composed of paraffins and olefins, were then passed through the catalytic reactor packed with the zeolite catalyst at 350 C.
Two *BEA zeolites from each category (BEA (L), BEA (S) and BEA (S)-DA) suffixed as -parent and -meso (surfactant-templated) were tested.
Fig. 5
a shows the product yield (wt%) of liquid, gas and char. The pyrolysis of LDPE produced 74.7 wt% liquid, 25.2 wt% gaseous product and  0.1 wt% of char. The production of gases is always higher when zeolites are used as compared to the control experiment without a catalyst. In the case of the *BEA (L)-meso, and *BEA (S)-DA-meso, they produced more gases than their parent catalysts (namely *BEA (L) and *BEA (S)-DA). However, the production of gases was not improved over small crystal sized BEA zeolite before dealumination.

b represents the carbon distribution (mol%-C) of the liquid product and coke. The different fractions in the liquid products were grouped in categories according to their carbon number as following: C7-C12, C13-C20 and C20+. The pyrolysis of LDPE produced 69 mol%-C and 5.7 mol%-C of C7-C12 and C13-C20 hydrocarbons respectively. However, the pyrolysis of LDPE produced less amount of single ring aromatic hydrocarbons as compared to catalytic cracking over *BEA zeolites (
Table S6
). The carbon distribution of liquid product showed an increase in the yield of the C7-C12 hydrocarbons and a decrease in the yield of C13-C20 over *BEA(L)-meso and *BEA (S)-DA-meso (
Fig. 5
b). Whereas *BEA-(S)-meso showed a decrease in the production of lighter hydrocarbons (C7-C13).

Fig. 6
shows the production of aromatic hydrocarbons (toluene, xylene, and ethylbenzene) over the *BEA zeolite. Both, an increase in toluene production and a decrease in the para-xylene selectivity were observed in the case of the BEA (L)-meso sample, while ethylbenzene production remained constant (
Fig. 6
a). These results are likely due to the increased external surface areas of surfactant-templated *BEA (
Table 1
), which favoured side-reactions (isomerisation) of xylene on the surface of the catalyst. Previous studies showed that both the deactivation of the external surface and the change in the diffusion path length of the catalyst significantly affects the selectivity of toluene and xylene during the disproportionation reaction of alkylbenzenes
[47]
. Therefore, zeolites with large crystal sizes and low activity tend to be more selective towards the para-xylene. As shown in
Fig. 6
a, owing to the high external surface area and less diffusional constraints in BEA (L)-meso, para-xylene selectivity decreased. The same trend was observed in the case of BEA (S)-meso and DA-meso. Coke deposition was remarkably reduced over BEA (L)-meso to 6.3 wt% as compared to 10.7 wt% over BEA (L)-parent, as expected for catalysts with enhanced diffusional properties of bulky molecules inside the pores (
Fig. 6
d). Zeolites with smaller crystal sizes, namely BEA (S), showed even a lower production of para-xylene (1.3 w/v %) as compared to those zeolites with larger crystal sizes BEA (L) (2.0 w/v %) (
Fig. 6
b). The raise in the Si/Al ratio of the zeolite produced by the acid treatment (dealumination, BEA (S)-DA) caused an increase in the production of para-xylene (2.5 w/v %) (
Fig. 6
c). These results show the interplay between active sites and diffusional path length of the zeolite in the production of xylene and toluene.
Catalytic cracking reaction follows a classical carbocation mechanism initiated by the carbonium ion, which undergoes successive β-scission to generate another carbonium ion and lower molecular weight olefinic compound
[48]
. Carbocation is initiated through either the extraction of hydride (associated with Lewis acid site) from the polymer chain or preferentially by the proton donation (associated with Brnsted acidity) to the CC bond
[49]
. Small alkenes compounds undergo oligomerisation/cyclisation/aromatization to produce aromatics. Hence, the activity of the catalysts plays a pertinent role in facilitating cracking reactions. Perez-Ramirez et al. showed that enhanced external surface area and accessibility to the active sites in desilicated *BEA zeolite brought down the degradation temperature of LDPE
[50]
. Also, decreased Si/Al ratio upon desilication implies more aluminium per gram of zeolite improved the catalytic activity of catalysts. A combination of accessibility and improved activity boosted the cracking performance
[50]
. On the contrary, Pyra et al. reported that in addition to the accessibility, the acid strength of active sites in the desilicated *BEA zeolite plays a decisive role in the cracking of LDPE
[16]
. As desilicated *BEA zeolite lost Brnsted acidity (strong acid site) considerably due to the Si and Al leaching process hence, exhibited lower cracking efficiency despite the easier access for the reactants to the reaction sites
[16]
.
Acidity, which plays a key role in many zeolite-catalysed reactions, was also maintained after the ultrafast surfactant-templating of *BEA zeolites reported here. More specifically, the NH3-TPD analysis (
Fig. 6
e) of BEA (L) represents two distinct ammonia desorption peaks associated with weak acid sites at 100250 C and strong acid sites at 300450 C. The surfactant-templating treatment of this zeolite generated strong acid sites, as shown in the NH3-TPD profile of BEA (L)-meso, which further validates the incorporation of octahedrally coordinated aluminium into the framework of zeolite (as discussed earlier,
Fig. 1
e). These strong acid sites (mainly associated with Brnsted acidity) greatly contribute to the higher cracking efficiency of this hierarchical catalyst. Hence, we can conclude that both the improved accessibility provided by the generation of precisely controlled 4 nm mesopores and the strong acid sites found in the BEA (L)-meso contribute to improve the cracking performance of this zeolite.
The analysis of the vapours obtained by the pyrolysis of LDPE showed a higher production of ethylene (1.32 mol%) and propylene (1 mol%) as compared to the lower selectivity of ethylene (0.88 mol %) and propylene (0.76 mol %) over the BEA (L)-parent zeolite (
Fig. S10
). This observation is likely due to the governing mechanism during the pyrolysis of LDPE (initiation, propagation, and termination) that yielded olefins through radical transfer reaction. However, lower olefinic production over BEA (L)-parent depicts the reduced accessibility to the active site, which are responsible for triggering the carbonation reactions during the catalytic cycle. When the BEA (L)-meso sample was subjected to the same catalytic test, the selectivity towards ethylene (1.9 mol%) and propylene (1.43 mol%) increased, whereas a small decrease in butadiene (4 mol %) confirmed the prevalence of the end-chain scission mechanism in highly active BEA (L)-meso catalyst.
5. Conclusions
The development of large amounts of intracrystalline mesoporosity in *BEA zeolite was achieved in a matter of just 2 min, thanks to the use of ultrafast surfactant-templating in a tubular reactor at 200 C. The formation of uniform mesoporosity whilst maintaining the intrinsic properties of the zeolite requires the careful adjustment of the treatment conditions, mainly of the CTA+ and OH concentrations. A narrow PSD centred at 4 nm pore width (Vmeso = 0.31 cm3 g1, Vt = 0.54 cm3 g1) for large crystal size *BEA zeolite, labelled as BEA (L), was obtained at a NaOH concentration of 1 mol L-1 and a CTAB/Si ratio of 0.08. Moreover, the Si/Al ratio (13.2) of surfactant-templated BEA (L) remained constant, whereas the desilicated sample suffered from significant silicon leaching (Si/Al 10.4), which provides strong evidence of the protective role of the surfactant when treating zeolite in alkaline solutions. When using the identical conditions for the surfactant-templating of a small crystal size *BEA zeolite (<100 nm-agglomerated), a broad PSD was observed. More specifically, two distinctive peaks centred at 4 nm and 10 nm were present in its PSD. This problem was overcome by simply adjusting the aluminium content in the zeolite through partial dealumination. Dealuminated BEA(S) was successfully surfactant-templated, exhibiting only one peak centred at 4 nm in its PSD. Both the total and the mesopore volumes obtained after the ultrafast surfactant-templating treatment were very high (Vmeso(max) = 0.46 cm3 g1, Vt = 0.68 cm3 g1, Sext = 650 m2 g1), while preserving the intrinsic properties of the zeolite. The catalytic superiority of BEA-meso was demonstrated in the cracking of the vapours obtained from the thermal pyrolysis of LDPE. Both the accessibility and the strength of active sites played a key role in the cracking performance of *BEA zeolites. The higher external surface and enhanced intracrystalline diffusion properties of the BEA-meso catalysts reduced the selectivity of para-xylene and improved toluene production, as compared to the BEA-parent catalysts. Moreover, coke deposition was remarkably reduced from 10.7 wt% over BEA (L)-parent to 6.3 wt% over BEA (L)-meso. Our results show the usefulness of the ultrafast surfactant-templating method to impart uniform intracrystalline mesoporosity in *BEA zeolites of different crystal size, Si/Al ratio, and texture properties in just a matter of a few minutes, opening new opportunities for the production of hierarchical zeolites in a rapid and effective manner.
