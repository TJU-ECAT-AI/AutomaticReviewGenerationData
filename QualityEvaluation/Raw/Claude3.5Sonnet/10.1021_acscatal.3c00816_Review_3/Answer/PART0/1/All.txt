By fixing the Pt loading at 0.32 wt% and increasing Sn loadings from 0 to 1.2 wt%, the size of PtSn clusters can be reduced from 4 nm to 1 nm. This ability to fine-tune the cluster size allows for optimizing the metal dispersion and surface area, which are crucial factors in catalytic performance.\n\nIn terms of catalytic performance, the optimized PtSn-ZSM-5 catalyst produced using this method exhibits significantly higher initial propane conversion (65%) compared to the impregnated Pt/Sn-ZSM-5 catalyst. This improved performance can be attributed to the better encapsulation and dispersion of PtSn clusters within the zeolite structure, which is made possible by the ultrafast crystallization strategy.", "Chinese": "Yu等人开发的超快速沸石结晶策略通过显著缩短ZSM-5沸石的结晶时间，解决了直接合成程序中金属包覆的时间尺度不匹配挑战。这种策略结合了前驱体老化、种子添加剂和快速加热管式反应器，能在170°C下5分钟内，或在190°C下2分钟内完成ZSM-5沸石的完全结晶。\n\n这种超快速结晶速率使PtSn簇能够完全包覆在ZSM-5沸石中。Pt纳米簇的形成与快速沸石结晶同时进行，这一点从硅基质中Pt负载量随沸石结晶度增加而增加得到证实。\n\n该策略通过更好地控制PtSn簇的尺寸来影响其结构。通过将Pt负载固定在0.32 wt%，并将Sn负载从0增加到1.2 wt%，可以将PtSn簇的尺寸从4 nm减小到1 nm。这种能够精细调节簇大小的能力允许优化金属分散度和表面积，这些是催化性能的关键因素。\n\n在催化性能方面，使用这种方法制备的优化PtSn-ZSM-5催化剂表现出显著更高的初始丙烷转化率（65%），相比于浸渍法制备的Pt/Sn-ZSM-5催化剂。这种性能的改善可归因于PtSn簇在沸石结构中更好的包覆和分散，而这正是超快结晶策略所实现的。", "Doi": "10.1021/acscatal.3c00816_3"},
