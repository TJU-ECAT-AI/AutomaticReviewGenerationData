Abstract
Ni-based catalysts using siliceous materials as the supports have suffered from two challenging issues of sintering and carbon deposition for dry reforming of methane (DRM), resulted from a weak metal-support interaction. Given these, a novel metalacid bifunctional Ni@S-1 zeolite catalyst is tailored from the evolution of hydroxylated nickel phyllosilicates that are formed by subtly controlling the coordination environments of Ni precursor complexes in the silicalite-1 (S-1) zeolite. The developed Ni0.44@S-1 catalyst renders almost equivalent CH4 and CO2 conversions (85.1 % and 88.7 %), high H2/CO molar ratio (about 1) and superb long-term stability during 100 h with no activity loss at 750 C with a WHSV of 100 L·gcat1·h1, outperforming other control catalysts under investigation. Such superior catalytic behavior benefits from the synergy between highly uniform Ni nanoparticles (35 nm) confined in the micropores of zeolite and substantially formed Lewis acid sites due to coordinatively unsaturated Ni2+ sites located at the reduced 2:1 nickel phyllosilicate, as revealed by detailed characterizations. Meanwhile, it further discloses that a benign balance between formation and elimination of process carbon species is responsible for improving the carbon resistance of catalyst during the DRM reaction. The present design broadens a new insight for the development of new Ni-based catalysts with simultaneous coking- and sintering-resistant for the DRM application.

1. Introduction
The emission of methane (CH4) and carbon dioxide (CO2) as notorious greenhouse gases has been a severe environmental issue that contributes significantly to the global warming and climate change. Given this, dry reforming of methane (DRM, CH4 + CO2  2H2 + 2CO, ΔH0 298 K= +247 kJ/mol) as a prospective benign process provides an effective way to transform them into valuable syngas that can be further converted into the assorted chemicals through adjustable H2/CO ratio

. However, two inescapable challenges of sintering and carbon deposition causing the gradual deactivation of catalysts need to be faced at high operating temperatures.
To overcome the above issues, Ni-based catalysts with multifarious structures have been designed and prepared by the spatial confinement effect and/or metal-support interaction. In popular, the assorted catalysts with coreshell

[18]

[19]
, etc., have been widely fabricated by Ni nanoparticles (NPs) encapsulated/embedded into various supports. Such catalysts perform a superior anti-sintering ability of Ni NPs than supported catalysts. For instance, Kawi's group
[20]
,
[21]
,
[22]
,
[23]
,
[24]
have developed a series of coreshell catalysts (e.g., Ni-Yolk@Ni@SiO2, Ni@SiO2 and silica@Ni@silica, etc.) that exhibited a better DRM performance than that of Ni/SiO2 catalyst. Unsatisfactorily, the coke deposition has not been effectively mitigated during the DRM reaction, especially at a low temperature and a high-space-velocity. A fact has been identified that although the coreshell structure plays a beneficial role in the sintering resistance of Ni active phases, the shell layer tends to preferentially select the defect sites (e.g., unsaturated sites, the surface vertices, edges and steps) adsorbed to the active phase

[13]

[14]

[22]

[26]
, hindering the contact between the reactants and the active phase so as to reduce the catalytic efficiency of Ni. On the other hand, the heterogeneity of coreshell layer also affects the mass transfer of reactants, intermediates and products, resulting in more complex hydrocarbon reconstruction behaviors of carbon species intermediates

[29]
, such as the accumulation of Cα into Cβ, thus accelerating the carbon deposition rate.
Facing the above scenario, some significant efforts have been devoted to reduce the formation and/or accelerate the consumption of carbon species during the DRM reaction. At present, one strategy is that the carbon deposition can be mitigated appropriately by adjusting the size of Ni NPs
[30]
,
[31]
,
[32]
. For instance, Zhang et al.
[30]
have prepared Ni@SiO2 catalysts with different Ni particle sizes (ca. 1.4, 1.9 and 2.6 nm). The advantage is that the smaller the Ni NPs size, the less carbon deposition. Other scholars utilize the nature of supports or the introduction of additives (e.g., alkali metals, alkaline earth metals and rare earth metals, etc.) to accelerate CO2 dissociation by building lattice oxygen (or surface oxygen) vacancies
[33]
,
[34]
,
[35]
,
[36]

[37]
, which also can be beneficial to eliminate carbon deposition. Given all of these, a novel attempt has been proposed in recent years that the electronic structure of surface Ni species (e.g., nickel phyllosilicate intermediates) can be tuned via a metal-support interaction
[34]
,
[38]
,
[39]
,
[40]

[41]
, which might be conductive to reduce the carbon deposition.
As mentioned above, some researchers' sight begins to turn to zeolitic supports, which are mainly due to its regular channels, high (hydro)thermal stability and defect structure. More importantly, the zeolite has been a better candidate to confine the Ni NPs and also has a good CO2 affinity. Both of them might natively establish a beneficial micro-environment for the DRM reaction. In view of all these, pure silica zeolites (e.g., MFI
[42]
,
[43]
, MEL
[41]
,
[44]
and MWW
[45]
, etc.) as the appropriate supports can be employed to achieve the nickel phyllosilicate intermediates in synthesis and confinement of Ni NPs in composite structures with a better shell, which are designed to solve the problems of carbon deposition, metal Ni sintering and utilization. For instance, Sun et al.
[44]
have precisely controlled the size of Ni NPs in the silicalite-2 (S-2) zeolite through the metastable Ni-O···Si interficial structure. The results have found that the Ni NPs in the Ni@S-2 catalyst with a low Ni loading (0.3 wt%) showed an excellent catalytic stability with no carbon deposition. Considering the DRM reaction, a higher Ni loading is crucial to ensure a higher mass-specific reaction rate. However, the Ni NPs migrate to the external surface of zeolite as the increase in Ni loadings, accompanied with the formation of carbon species that is difficult to be eliminated during the DRM reaction
[42]
,
[43]
,
[46]
,
[47]
. Therefore, designing functionalized Ni species active phases in Ni-based zeolite catalyst will be imperative in building a benign balance between the formation and the consumption of process carbon species during the DRM reaction at low temperatures. Recently, Kong et al.
[48]
have designed a metalacid bifunctional NiSi-PS catalyst that performed a superior low-temperature hydrogenolysis.
To meet the above situation, dual spatial confinement effect caused by a strong physicalchemical interaction among the active phase, the surface and the channel of support will be taken as a new breakthrough point. Different [Ni-O-Si-] stable polymerization structures (namely, nickel phyllosilicates) will be tailored by the interaction of Ni species with support in the high energy position of the siliceous zeolites, which ought to be employed to achieve the fabrication of bifunctional Ni species active phases, so that it will perform the abilities of sintering- and carbon-resistance. As expected, the catalytic activity and stability of the target catalyst will be improved.
Herein, we have precisely controlled the synthesis of Ni precursor complexes with different coordination states by adjusting the ratio of Ni2+ cations to organic ligands. Subsequently, smaller-sized Ni NPs (35 nm) embedded Ni phyllosilicate as a metalacid bifunctional zeolite catalyst is tailored (cf.
Scheme 1
). The encapsulated Ni NPs in the micropore of silicalite-1 zeolite exhibits a highly anti-sintering and the ability to activate CH4. Meanwhile, the Ni phyllosilicate intermediates as the Lewis acid sites can adsorb and dissociate the CO2 to generate the active hydroxyls (oxygen) species that are beneficial for the elimination of process carbon species. Such a Ni-based catalyst with bifunctional Ni species active phases can build a benign balance between the formation and the elimination of process carbon species to improve the stability of DRM reaction at low temperatures.

In this work, the [Ni(En)x(H2O)(6-2x)]2+ (x = 0, 1, 2, 3, respectively) were employed as the precursor complexes to enable the controllable fabrication of bifunctional Ni species active phases in zeolite crystal. Specifically, the Ni precursors with different coordination states were prepared by adding Ni(NO3)2·6H2O in the En aqueous solution under stirring at room temperature until complete dissolution. The molar ratio of Ni to En was 0.04, 0.09, 0.18 and 0.44, respectively.

The synthesis gel was prepared with a molar composition of TEOS: TPAOH: H2O: [Ni(En)x(H2O)(6-2x)]2+=1: 0.4: 35: 1. Typically, 13.0 g TPAOH was added into 15 mL de-ionized water. After stirring for 0.5 h, 8.32 g TEOS was added into the above mixture. After stirring for another 6 h, TEOS was hydrolyzed completely. Afterwards, the prepared [Ni(En)x(H2O)(6-2x)]2+ precursor was slowly dropped into the above solution and stirred for another 2 h. The mixture was transferred into a 50 mL Teflon lined stainless steel autoclave and dynamically crystallized at 170 C for 4 days. The resulting white solid was filtrated and washed with de-ionized water until pH of 7, dried at 80 C for overnight, and then calcined in air at 550 C for 8 h. The final samples were named as Nim@S-1, where m expressed the molar ratio of Ni to En. The corresponding Ni loadings were shown in

. The Ni/S-1 sample was synthesized by incipient wetness impregnation. As a typical case, the prepared [Ni(En)x(H2O)(6-2x)]2+ was dissolved in 10 mL de-ionized water and made 2 g S-1 disperse into the above solution. After rotation evaporation at 50 C for 3 h, the sample was calcined at 550 C for 8 h.

Ni loadings in the samples were measured by inductively coupled plasma with atomic emission spectrometer (ICP-AES, iCAP-6300, Thermo). Prior to the measurement, the sample was treated by the HF solution, and the dissolved mixtures were diluted to satisfy concentration detection range of the instrument.
Nitrogen adsorptiondesorption isotherms were conducted at 196 C on a Micromeritics ASAP 2020. Prior to the experiment, the sample was pre-treated at 350 C in a vacuum for 6 h. The specific surface area was calculated by using the Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) method.

Binding energy values of all the samples were calibrated based on a C 1 s peak at 284.8 eV. Before the measurement, the sample was reduced at 750 C and then was sealed in a quartz tube with an Ar protection.Liquid UVvis diffuse reflectance (UVvis DR) spectra were obtained on a UV-1800PC spectrophotometer. Solid UVvis DR spectra were collected on a TU-1901 spectrophotometer in the diffuse reflectance mode equipped with an integrating sphere with BaSO4 as the standard for solid samples.

H2-temperature programmed reduction (H2-TPR) was performed on a Micromeritics AutoChem II 2920 instrument. Prior to the experiment, the catalyst sample (ca. 50 mg) was pre-treated under an Ar flow rate of 20 mL·min1 at 500 C for 1 h, cooling to room temperature, and then a 10 % H2/Ar (30 mL·min1) was introduced. H2-TPR profile was conducted from 40 to 850 C with a heating rate of 10 oC·min1.
H2 chemisorption was performed on a H2-Chem analyzer by H2 pulse experiments to measure Ni dispersion. Prior to measurement, the sample (ca. 100 mg) was H2 pre-treated at 750 C for 1 h, followed by degassing treatment at the same temperature for 1 h to eliminate chemisorbed H2 and water. The isotherms were measured at room temperature. Estimated dispersion was based on spherical geometry and an adsorption stoichiometry of Ni/H = 1.
Differential thermo-gravimetric analysis (DTA) was performed on a STA449F3 Jupiter instrument. The variation in the weight of spent sample (ca. 20 mg) was monitored by increasing the system temperature in air from 50 to 800 C.
CO2-temperature programmed desorption (CO2-TPD) was performed on a Micromeritics AutoChem II 2920 instrument to investigate the basic sites on the catalysts. The sample (ca. 100 mg) was taken into a U-tube and reduced at 750 C for 1 h under a 10 % H2/Ar (30 mL·min1) and then cooled to room temperature under He (30 mL·min1). After that, CO2 (20 mL·min1) was dosed into the system until adsorption saturation and then was purged with He (30 mL·min1) for 1 h. Finally, the system temperature increased from 30 to 700 C at a heating rate of 10 oC·min1, and the CO2-TPD curve was recorded with a TCD detector.
In situ FTIR experiments were carried out on a Bruker VERTEX 70 spectroscopy. Firstly, the sample (ca. 1015 mg) was reduced at 750 C for 0.5 h under a 10 % H2/Ar and then cooled to 50 C. Subsequently, in situ FTIR experiments were conducted by in succession introducing the feed gas (CH4: CO2: N2 = 1: 1: 1, 25 mL·min1) at a heating rate of 10 oC·min1 from 50 to 700 C. Each spectrum was recorded at an interval 50 C.
2.4. Catalytic tests
The DRM reaction was evaluated in a fixed bed reactor. The reaction tube with a length of 45 cm, an outer diameter of 10 mm and an inner diameter of 6 mm was used. Prior to the reaction, all the catalysts (ca. 20 mg, 40 to 60 mesh) were reduced at 750  for 1 h with a 10 % H2 balanced with Ar (30 mL·min1). Subsequently, the mixed gases consisted of CH4: CO2: N2 = 1: 1: 1 at a certain flow was passed into the reactor, and the DRM were conducted at different temperatures. Stability tests were performed as a function of time-on-stream at 650 and 750 C, respectively. The reactants and products were on-line analyzed on a Fuli 9790II gas chromatography (GC) in combination with TCD and FID detectors, for the purpose of CH4, CO2, CO, and H2 on-line analysis. Samples were collected via an automated six-way valve containing a sample loop until at least three consecutive measurements were in the range of approximately 2 % error. Liquid products (i.e., H2O) generated from the reaction were removed from the outlet stream by a water trap cooled by an ice bath. The gas flow rate in the outlet of the reactor was measured using a bubble-flow meter in order to the CH4 conversion (

2.5. Kinetic studies
Kinetic experiments were performed to determine the reaction rate, apparent activation energy and turnover frequency (TOF) of the DRM reaction. Specifically, differential reactors loaded with less amount of catalyst, a high WHSV (ignoring the pressure drop) and a low reaction temperature were employed to control the conversions lower than 15 % in order to eliminate the thermal and diffusion limitations (see
