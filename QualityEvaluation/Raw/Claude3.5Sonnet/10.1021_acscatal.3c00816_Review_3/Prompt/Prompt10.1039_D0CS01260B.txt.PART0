Recent progress in heterogeneous metal and metal oxide catalysts for direct dehydrogenation of ethane and propane
Catalytic non-oxidative direct dehydrogenation of light alkanes serves as an effective reinforcement to selectively produce the corresponding olefins, and the heterogeneous metals and metal oxides, not limited to the commercially used Pt- and Cr-based catalysts, are widely investigated to enhance the efficiency.

1. Introduction
Light olefins, namely, ethylene, propylene and butylene are important chemical building blocks for the mass manufacture of a variety of high-value chemicals and intermediates such as polymers and oxygenates. The commercial processes for production of ethylene and propylene rely on steam cracking (SC) and fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) of naphtha and heavy oil. To satisfy the significantly growing global demands for olefins, the catalytically selective direct dehydrogenation (DH) of alkanes can serve as an effective supplement in view of the large-scale exploitation of shale gas. In comparison with the pathways of methanol-to-olefins (MTO), FischerTropsch to olefins (FTO), and alkane oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) using O2, CO2 and N2O as oxidants, exclusive selectivity to olefins is a unique property of the DH processes.
Non-oxidative ethane dehydrogenation (EDH) and propane dehydrogenation (PDH) are thermodynamically limited reactions with highly endothermic properties, as shown below:
Considering the high chemical stability of the CH bonds in these two molecules, the direct dehydrogenation reactions require a high temperature to gain a satisfactory yield of olefins. A temperature range of 550 to 700 C results in reaching the equilibrium conversions of the atmospheric EDH reaction from ca. 10% to 40%, while the equilibrium conversion at 600 C corresponds to ca. 50% for the atmospheric PDH reaction. Unlike olefin molecules possessing an unsaturated CC bond, ethane and propane consisting only of CC and CH bonds are more difficult to adsorb on the catalyst surface and to be activated. Though the geometric effect favors the activation of the CH bond rather than the CC bond for the two alkanes, the catalytic selectivity control of the CH cleavage than the CC cleavage still cannot be ignored in view of their average binding energies, which are 347 and 414 kJ mol1 for their CC and CH bonds, respectively. Therefore, efficient and selective activation of the CH bond with suppression of the CC cleavage is the most important factor for determining the performances of the EDH and PDH catalysts.
The binding energies of the weakest CH bonds are 444 and 361 kJ mol1 for ethylene and propylene, respectively. Only one CC double bond exists in ethylene with a binding energy of 720 kJ mol1, whereas the CC single bond is the weakest with a binding energy of 414 kJ mol1 for propylene. Furthermore, in addition to being readily desorbed as the target products, the olefins can also serve as the intermediates to be involved in further transformation reactions for coke formation or low-carbon by-products, owing to stronger adsorption of olefins relative to alkanes. Taking such differences in the adsorption-desorption properties into account, the utilization of appropriate catalysts is necessary to achieve high selectivity toward olefins for both DH reactions, especially for the PDH reaction, considering a lower stability of propylene relative to ethylene.
EDH and PDH reactions run at high reaction temperatures under reductive atmospheres, e.g., co-fed alkane and hydrogen, resulting in the structural change of active metal or metal oxide species through sintering, reconstruction, and/or reduction. Furthermore, the high reaction temperatures and harsh conditions cause the deposition of coke species on the catalyst. Either the structural evolution of catalytic active sites or the severe coke poisoning leads to irreversible deactivation of the DH catalysts. To maintain an acceptable service lifetime, the removal of the coke from the used catalyst is required by performing frequent regeneration that is undesired for the industrial production.
In the case of the PDH process, two primary commercial technologies of the Oleflex process using PtSn/Al2O3-based catalysts and the Catofin process using CrOx/Al2O3-based catalysts have been developed in the last few decades. Several heterogeneous catalysts based on transition metals, metal oxides and carbon materials have also attracted wide attention for the PDH reactions in recent years. For these DH catalysts, however, the above-mentioned multiple issues may still exist directly affecting the catalytic performances, including the selective activation of the CH bonds over the CC bonds, the desorption of olefins, the catalyst structure stability, and the anti-coking ability.
Previous excellent reviews have broadly elaborated the activation of light alkanes as well as the DH or ODH reactions of ethane-to-ethylene and propane-to-propylene. Bhasin et al. reviewed the DH and ODH reactions of paraffins to olefins in 2001.1 Sun and Basset et al. introduced the ODH reactions of ethane and propane in their review of the catalytic oxidation of C1C4 light alkanes over heteropoly compounds in 2011, while Hermans et al. outlined the metal oxide-catalyzed ODH reactions of ethane and propane in 2017.2,3 Lercher et al. reviewed the ethane ODH processes with respect to the catalytic mechanisms and catalyst materials as well as the reactor concepts.4 Carrero et al. addressed the propane ODH reactions over supported VOx-based catalysts in 2014, while Lu et al. clearly explained the catalytic origin of BN-catalyzed ODH reactions of light alkanes in 2018.5,6 Chen et al. described the ODH of light alkanes over heterogeneous catalysts in the presence of CO2 as a mild oxidant.7 Weckhuysen et al. systematically reviewed the catalytic DH processes of light alkanes over metals and metal oxides in 2014.8 Recently, Yuan et al. comparatively discussed the state-of-the-art catalysts for the PDH reactions mainly focusing on the Pt-, Cr-, V-, Ga- and carbon-based catalysts.9
In this review, the novel catalysts mainly reported within the last five years are outlined for EDH and PDH reactions, considering that several newly developed synthesis strategies and in situ characterization techniques have been adopted to provide insights at the atomic and molecular levels. The screened catalysts are classified into Pt-based catalysts, CrOx, VOx and GaOx-based catalysts with multiple active sites, ZnOx-, Co/CoOx-, Fe/FeOx- and SnOx-based catalysts with relatively single active sites, ZrOx-based catalysts with coordinatively unsaturated Zr ions as the active sites, and other metals or metal oxides catalysts such as PdCu, Ni, and TiO2. The relationships between the structure and properties of these catalysts in key processes, including CH and CC activation, adsorption-desorption, and coking, are also discussed for facing the challenges existing in the alkane DH processes.
2. Screening of EDH and PDH catalysts
2.1. Pt-Based catalysts
One of the commercial PDH manufacturing processes, the UOP C3 Oleflex process, employs the Al2O3-supported Pt catalysts. As the most commonly used PDH catalysts so far, the Pt-based catalysts show several advantages in comparison with CrOx-based catalysts or others, for instance, higher reaction rate, higher stability for longer working periods before regeneration, and better environmental-friendliness. However, they are still subject to the deactivation issues that are caused by the metal sintering and coke poisoning during the reaction under harsh conditions and at high temperatures. The oxidative regeneration for the coke removal may also lead to the irreversible structural change of active metal sites. Therefore, toward the Pt-catalyzed PDH process, numerous efforts have been made to develop efficient and stable catalysts based on extending the knowledge of the structureperformance relationship and the catalytic mechanism. In this section, the Pt-based catalysts will be reviewed with respect to the size effect of Pt particles, cluster- and single-sites, the promotion effect of bimetals, and the effect of the selected supports including metal oxides, zeolites, and metal-free materials.
2.1.1. Size effect and single-atom catalysts It has been reported that the Pt-catalyzed PDH reaction is highly structure-sensitive, and both the selective activation of propane CH bond to form propylene and the cleavage of CC bond to yield C1C2 products as well as the coking step are significantly influenced by the size and the exposed facet of Pt. For instance, the mesoporous SBA-15-supported 3 nm Pt nanoparticles display higher propane conversion and coke amount but lower propylene selectivity than the supported 21 nm particles.10 For the PDH reaction catalyzed by the 39 nm Pt clusters supported on the calcinated layered double hydroxides (LDHs), the propane conversion decreases but the propylene selectivity increases with increasing Pt size (Fig. 1a).11 The kinetic analyses demonstrate that the reaction order of propane is 1 for all ranges of catalysts, whereas that of hydrogen is different, which varies from 0.07 to 0.57 for 39 nm Pt clusters (Fig. 1b and c). A greater kinetic isotope effect exists in the 9 nm Pt clusters than 3 nm clusters by switching C3H8 to C3D8 in the PDH reaction, suggesting a change in the reaction rate for the CH activation between these two catalysts. The smaller and larger clusters are dominated by the (211) and (111) planes of Pt, respectively. According to the DFT calculation results, the Pt(211) sites display a lower dehydrogenation energy barrier, while the Pt(111) sites exhibit a weakened binding strength of propylene and an increased energy barrier for the deep dehydrogenation of propylene. Furthermore, the rate-limiting steps on the Pt(211) and Pt(111) sites are identified as the first CH bond activation and the second CH bond activation, respectively. These results are in accordance with the experimental observations that higher activity favors the small Pt clusters while higher selectivity and stability favor the larger clusters.

The synthesis parameters influence the metal particle size for the as-obtained Pt-based catalysts. For instance, a controlled pH value in the co-precipitation synthesis can produce a small size of Pt particles with a high dispersion degree, and the optimal pH is 8 for the PtIn/Mg(Al)O catalyst that possesses 1.8 nm particle size with 41.6% Pt dispersion.12 For the PtIn/Mg(Al)O-p8 catalyst, the periclase MgO with a high surface area and less strong acidic sites and the In0 species provide strong interactions with the metallic Pt sites. The atomic layer deposition (ALD)-based synthesis approach can also be applied to tailor the size and phase of bimetallic nanoparticles. The Pt/In2O3 bilayer by ALD preparation can be transformed into PtIn alloy nanoparticles through atomic migration and coalescence via a reductive treatment, and the size and phase of the bilayers can be precisely tuned by the deposition thickness and Pt/In ratio.13 The ALD-synthesized bimetallic Pt3In/SiO2 catalyst displays 100% propylene selectivity and 3 s1 TOF in the PDH reaction at 600 C.
The atomically precise single-atom (SA) and single-atom alloy (SAA) catalysts have become one kind of the most active new frontiers in the heterogeneous catalysis.14,15 The SA catalysts consist of well-defined isolated active metal atoms, ions, or complexes on the supports, exhibiting distinct and great catalytic performance for various reactions. The SA and SAA catalysts are capable of activating the CH bonds of alkanes at low temperatures without coke formation.16,17 For instance, the SA Pt+ is in situ generated using 193 nm ultraviolet laser dissociation of the ligand-protected Pt clusters in a high-resolution mass spectrometer platform.18 The Pt+ site selectively promotes the dehydrogenation of ethane and propane to corresponding [Pt + olefin]+ and [Pt + alkyne]+ species, whereas it reacts with methane to produce [Pt + ethane]+ and [Pt + ethylene]+ species through a cross-coupling reaction of the PtCH2 intermediates.18 The PDH processes catalyzed by SA Pt on graphene and the modification effects of dopants are investigated with DFT calculations.19 By activating the first and second CH bonds of propane at the SA Pt sites on the pyridine N-doped support, a comparable energy barrier of propane activation at 0.37 eV is observed on this Pt/graphene model in comparison with other Pt catalysts.
Considering the harsh conditions for the metal-catalyzed alkane DH reactions, the thermal stability is a challenge for the SA and SAA catalysts at high temperatures. Although the SA Pt sites in the monometallic 0.02Pt/Al2O3-SA catalyst convert a small amount of propane molecules with a low reaction rate in the initial stage of the PDH reaction, the evolution from the SA structure to the large nanoparticles can be observed as the reaction proceeds under high-temperature reductive conditions.20 The addition of Sn species in the PtSn/CeO2 catalyst allows the SA Pt species to in situ transform into the small PtSn nanoclusters during the PDH reaction at 680 C.21 The coexistence of the Pt SA and the SnO2 particle on CeO2 support can be achieved by oxidative regeneration at 580 C, reflecting a completely reversible process of the self-assembly and redispersion for the Pt and Sn species (Fig. 2ac). An activation stage exists in the initial PDH reaction, which responds to the self-assembly process (Fig. 2d), and the formed PtSn3 cluster sites are thermally stable and catalytically selective, due to the facile desorption of propylene as the target product. The ingenious structural design and good control of the metal-support interaction for the SA or SAA catalysts is crucial to tune their catalytic dehydrogenation properties.

The Pt/Cu SAA catalyst, in which Pt atoms predominately monodisperse in the Cu surface layer, can achieve the activation of CH bonds in methyl groups at 80 C, 100 C lower than that on pure Cu surfaces.22 The Pt/Cu SAA-catalyzed CH activation process can prevent the formation of coke, which easily occurs at pure Pt surfaces, due to an intermediate CH activation energy barrier and the endothermic nature for the formation process of dehydrogenated fragments. In the case of a γ-Al2O3-supported Pt/Cu SAA catalyst with a high Cu/Pt ratio, the individual brighter Pt atoms disperse in Cu nanoparticles (Fig. 3a), showing 90% propylene selectivity and 10.6 mol gPt1 h1 formation rate as well as great long-term stability in >120 h PDH reaction at 520 C (Fig. 3b and c).23 The theoretical calculation results demonstrate that the Pt/Cu SAA species are different from the conventional alloy with respect to the free energy barriers in the first and second dehydrogenation as well as desorption steps (Fig. 3d and e). Both enhanced desorption of surface-bounded propylene and prohibited deep dehydrogenation side reaction are of benefit to the high selectivity of the Pt/Cu SAA catalyst. A thermally stable PtGa-Pb/SiO2 catalyst is developed as one of the effective SA catalysts for the PDH reaction.24 The threefold hollow Pt3 ensembles and the Pt SAs coexist in the catalyst, and the former can be selectively blocked and disabled by the atomic size Pb deposition, while the latter can be isolated using the inert Ga species. The SA Pt site selectively enables the activation of the first and second CH bonds, contributing to a propylene selectivity of as high as 99.6% and great stability in a 96 h PDH reaction at 600 C. For the PtFe intermetallic compound catalysts, the SAA PtFe3 and the ensembles of PtFe and Pt3Fe display a significant difference in the electronic property. The order of the average energy of the filled Pt 5d orbitals is PtFe3 > PtFe > Pt3Fe. The absence of PtPt bonds in the SAA catalyst contributes to the enhanced selectivity for propylene in the PDH reaction.25 The geometric and electronic modification of the second metal species as the promoters strongly affects the SAA-catalyzed alkane DH performances.

The selected support also influences the electronic and catalytic properties of the SAA catalysts. For instance, the SA Pt1 in Cr2O3(0001) surface donates electrons to both the adjacent O ions and the Cr ions located at two lattice sites away, whereas the SA Pt1 in the ZnO(100) surface transfers the electron to the adjacent O ions only.26 A dual-function of the SA Pt-doped Ga2O3 catalyst has been reported for the PDH reaction.27 By combining the DFT calculations and microkinetic analysis results, the PtO and GaO sites of Pt1Ga2O3(100) are believed to be responsible for the activated dehydrogenation of propane and the recombinative desorption of hydrogen, respectively. The specific interaction between SA Pt and Ga2O3 can prohibit the deep dehydrogenation and enhance the anti-reduction ability of Ga2O3 for increasing both the propylene selectivity and catalyst stability. The PDH reaction over SA Pt supported on BN nanosheets with B and N vacancies has been investigated by DFT calculations, and better propylene desorption and higher activity of propane CH activation are observed on the SA Pt on a N vacancy rather than on a B vacancy.28
Surface organometallic chemistry (SOMC) serves as an effective approach to construct the well-defined surface metal species by employing the single-site metal precursors.29,30 For instance, the hydrogenolysis of the Sn(n-C4H9)3 fragments grafted on Pt surfaces leads to the formation of PtSn bimetals with isolated Pt atoms.31 The grafting of the Pt precursor [Pt(OSi(OtBu)3)2(COD)] on the single-site GaIII-modified SiO2 produces the GaIIIPtII/SiO2 structure, and further reduction at 500 C leads to the formation of the Gaδ+Pt0/SiO2 catalyst that contains nanometric bimetallic GaxPt (0.5 < x < 0.9) alloys along with a fraction of GaIII single-sites.32 At 550 C and a WHSV as high as 98.3 h1, the Gaδ+Pt0/SiO2 catalyst displays over 99% propylene selectivity and a high productivity of 31.5 gC3H6 gcat1 h1, which are significantly higher than those of the monometallic Pt0/SiO2 and GaIII/SiO2 catalysts (0.24 and 0.16 gC3H6 gcat1 h1, respectively). The structural stability of the Gaδ+Pt0/SiO2 catalyst in a 20 h reaction is evidenced by the in situ XAS measurement results, and the deposition of coke may cause its slight deactivation. A subnanometric PtZn/SiO2 catalyst with 0.8 nm cluster size is prepared by a similar SOMC strategy (Fig. 4ac). It shows a high propylene productivity of 703375 gC3H6 gcat1 h1 and 95% selectivity in a 30 h PDH reaction at 550 C and 75 h1 WHSV, which benefits from the high dispersion of alloy metal and the anti-sintering function of the surface ZnII single-sites.33 The dispersion of the organoplatinum sites on the single-site ZnII-modified SiO2 ((MeCp)PtMex/Zn/SiO2) can be achieved by an ALD preparation process, and a further reduction at 550 C produces bimetallic PtZn/SiO2 catalyst for catalyzing the n-butane DH reaction (Fig. 4d).34 The Pt and Zn homogeneously disperse in the PtZn alloy nanoparticles with 1.2 nm average size. An increased electron density of surface Pt metal is observed due to the promotion effect of Zn species (Fig. 4e and f).

2.1.2. Effect of promoter in bimetallic catalysts (1) Electronic and geometric modification In consideration of the unsatisfactory selectivity to olefin and the short catalyst life of the monometallic Pt catalysts for alkane dehydrogenation, it is vital to develop the bimetallic Pt-based catalysts by introducing a second promoter metal for improving the catalytic properties. The structure of the bimetals includes coreshell, heterostructure, alloy and inter-metallic phase, and the synergetic effects between the individual metals depend on the specific structures and metal kinds.
The multiple catalytic functions of Sn, the most commonly used promoter for Pt catalysts, can be divided into geometric and electronic modifications. In the case of the geometric modification effect, Sn species facilitate the dispersion of Pt species for reducing the availability to form ensembles, and even ideally isolate Pt to exist in the SA state as mentioned in the above section. With respect to the electronic modification, Sn species donate electrons to Pt for increasing the electron density of Pt and correspondingly modulating the binding strength of alkane and olefin as well as various intermediates. For the EDH reactions on the PtSn monolayers with 1/4 and 1/2 coverages on the Pt(111) surface, the potential energy surfaces for all C1 and C2 derivatives from ethane CH and CC bond cleavage suggest that the binding energies of all these species can be weakened in the presence of the Sn promoter.35 A purely electronic effect without changing binding geometries exists in the low-Sn-coverage surface model, whereas a geometric modification with a great change in energy barriers is observed on the high-Sn-coverage model. The degree of the strong metal-support interaction (SMSI) between Pt and Sn species is found to be continuously tuned by the thermal treatment parameters.36 The oxidatively treated PtSn/SiO2 catalyst exhibits a larger Pt particle size and a stronger PtSnO2 SMSI than those of the catalyst calcinated in an inert atmosphere. The reduction pretreatment in hydrogen leads to the formation of the highly dispersed surface Sn-enriched PtSn alloy nanoparticles with the strongest SMSI and the electron-rich Pt sites, acting as the most active catalyst for the alkane dehydrogenation.
In addition to Sn, the promotion effect of the group IB metals (i.e. Cu, Ag and Au) has also been reported for the Pt-based bimetal catalysts in alkane dehydrogenation.37 The bimetallic PtCu/MgAl2O4 catalyst displays higher propylene productivity and selectivity as well as a greater regeneration stability than the PtAg/MgAl2O4 and PtAu/MgAl2O4 catalysts.38 The Cu and Ag as the second metal can dilute the surface Pt atoms and donate an electron to Pt for increasing the electron density of Pt, while an inverse situation is observed on the PtAu bimetal. The introduction of Cu on the PtCu/Al2O3 catalyst also increases the catalytic PDH performances. The PtCu interaction not only inhibits the CC bond cleavage by an increased energy barrier, and also promotes the propylene desorption for preventing the formation of the coke precursors.39
For the EDH catalyzed by alloy models of Pt and post-transition metals (i.e. Pb, Bi, Sb, Ge, etc.), all these alloys decrease the binding energy of the carbonaceous species in comparison with the monometallic Pt.40 Furthermore, the modification effects on Pt depends on the coverage of these metals, which is similar to the situation of PtSn bimetal. The electronic effects dominate at low alloy coverage (1/4 ML), whereas the geometric effects play an important role in surface-adsorbate interactions at higher alloy coverage (1/2 ML). A Ge-promoted Pt0.5Ge1.5/Al2O3 alloy catalyst shows a superior stability and higher propylene selectivity (97.2% vs. 56.9%) than the monometallic Pt/Al2O3 catalyst for the PDH reaction.41 A geometric modification of Ge on the Pt site is observed through the isolation effect to break the Pt ensembles, while an electronic effect also confirms that Ge can withdraw an electron from Pt to enhance the activity of the CH bond cleavage and to suppress the CC bond cleavage.
With the aid of the ensemble effects of both geometric and electronic modifications through elimination of large Pt ensembles and electron transformation, the supported PtIn0.7 and PtIn1.4 bimetals on SiO2 exhibit 100% ethylene selectivity and 1.62.8 s1 initial specific reaction rate in the EDH reaction at 600 C, whereas the monometallic Pt/SiO2 catalyst displays 73% ethylene selectivity and a rate of 0.7 s1.42 The PtIn intermetallic alloy phase is related to the ratio of In to Pt. For instance, the Pt3In phase with a Cu3Au structure for PtIn0.7 alloy and a PtIn2 shell with a CaF2 structure around a core of Pt3In for the PtIn1.4 alloy. Based on the DFT calculation results, Pt3In bimetal may possess a comparable activity with Pt3Sn, achieving a balance between the propane conversion and propylene selectivity.43 The presence of In atoms contributes to the isolation of Pt atoms with increased electron density and the reduction of step Pt sites with low coordination. A colloidal synthesis method is used to prepare uniform PtIn bimetal nanoparticles, eliminating the phase segregation of large excesses of In oxide.44 The In-rich PtIn2 catalyst on SiO2 support exhibits the highest reaction rate for the EDH reaction at 600 C due to both the strong electronic perturbation to Pt sites and the geometric modification by In atoms. A greater thermal stability of the colloidal-synthesized PtIn2 catalyst against a stress test at 800 C is also achieved in comparison with the impregnated catalyst, which is attributed to the high phase uniformity that cannot lead to the reduction and vaporization of unalloyed In promoter atoms for deactivation.
The inhibiting effect on the CC cleavage and a six-fold increase of specific reaction rate are observed on the SiO2-supported Pt1Zn1 intermetallic alloys relative to the monometallic Pt for the EDH reaction at 600 C (Fig. 5a and b).45 The isolation of Pt sites and the modified electronic property can originate from the incorporation of Zn atoms into bimetals (Fig. 5c and d), decelerating the side reactions of hydrogenolysis and cracking and weakening the bond formation between the 5d orbitals of Pt and adsorbates. The PtMn alloyed nanoparticles on MnOx-decorated mesoporous SiO2 show high activity and stability in a 100 h long-term PDH reaction at 590 C due to the electron transfer from Mn to Pt, while the formation of the nanosized alloy structure is in situ achieved during the pre-activation process.46 The surface density of MnOx sites on SiO2 and their interaction with [PtCl6]2 precursor species are believed to be the key factors to determine the structures of the PtxMny alloys.

(2) Coreshell structure of bimetals The ordered alloy phase for a Pt-containing nanoparticle or nanocluster can ensure that all Pt atoms experience homogeneously geometric and electronic modification. However, the formation of a surface alloy layer may be necessary to achieve the isolation and modification of Pt sites, reaching a comparable catalytic performance to a fully alloyed structure for the DH reactions. A comparative study demonstrates that both coreshell Pt-Pt3V and full alloy Pt3V phases show similarly high propylene selectivity in the PDH reactions, and a Pt3V alloy shell with 23 atomic layer thickness is sufficient for the electronic modification.47 Further investigations reveal that such electronic modification in Pt-V alloy is not caused by the electron transfer but rather a change in the energy of the unfilled and filled Pt 5d orbitals for tuning the binding geometry and strength of reaction-relevant adsorbates on the alloys.
The effects of the subsurface atoms have also been observed on the core@shell Pt@PtM (M = Sn, Sb, Mn, Fe, Co, and Ni) nanoparticles for the PDH reactions. The SiO2-supported 23 nm Pt@Pt1Sn1 coreshell nanoparticles possess a highly ordered hexagonal Pt1Sn1 intermetallic shell on the Pt core, displaying a superior catalytic PDH performance than that of the monometallic Pt.48 The geometric modification of Sn in the shell reduces the Pt ensembles for a high propylene selectivity, while the electronic modification weakens the Pt-hydrocarbon chemisorption energies for increasing the reaction rate. In the SiO2-supported core@shell Pt@Pt1Sb1 nanoparticles, strong Pt-Sb bonds are formed and the Pt atoms are isolated by the Sb atoms for a change in the energy levels of the Pt1Sb1 surface alloy shell.49 The SiO2-supported monometallic Pt, core@shell Pt@Pt3Mn, and full alloy Pt3Mn nanoparticles show similar sizes of 2.0 nm, and nonetheless, their propylene selectivity is in an increasing order, which is 32%, 82%, and 98%, respectively (Fig. 6).50 In comparison with the pure Pt surface, the L12-symmetry Pt3Mn intermetallic subsurface significantly enhances the selectivity of the CH activation rather than the CC cleavage in the PDH reaction through lowering the adsorption heats of hydrocarbon and hydrogen on the surfaces. For the bimetallic Pt catalysts modified by 3d transition metals at the surface and subsurface, the selectivity for the PDH reactions decreases in the sequence of Pt  PtFe > PtCo > PtNi considering that the exposed Ni and Co sites prefer to easily break the CC bonds of propane (Fig. 7a and b).51 However, when the surface transition metals on the nanoparticles are completely removed to form the Pt-skin catalyst on the bimetallic subsurface, the selectivity switches to an order of Pt < PtNi@Pt < PtCo@Pt < PtFe@Pt. Such increasing selectivity is well consistent with the downshifting trend of the d-band center in these coreshell bimetallic systems, reflecting the electronic modification effect of the subsurface atoms (Fig. 7c).

The subsurface catalysis has also been investigated by DFT calculations with respect to the propylene selectivity and coke formation in the PDH reactions catalyzed by 11 kinds of the Pt-based core@shell alloys, M@Pt (M = Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Ru, Rh, Pd, Ag, Os, Ir, and Au).52 Their electronic structures of metal surface modified by the strain effect and electron transfer effect are established to connect with their adsorption energies of propylene as the descriptors for the PDH reaction kinetics. All these core@shell catalysts show less negative propylene adsorption energies and higher activation energies than the pure Pt catalyst, resulting in lower PDH activity but higher selectivity to propylene.
2.1.3. Catalysts on Al2O3-based supports Al2O3, as the mostly used support for metal-based DH catalysts, possesses several advantages, including high thermal stability and mechanical strength, easily tuned porosity and acidity, and low cost. Unlike the weakly interacting SiO2 support that causes irreversible sintering of the metallic sites and deactivation of the catalyst during the oxidative regeneration stage after the PDH reaction, the Al2O3 support can provide a stronger interaction with the metal sites.53 For Al2O3 supports, their phase, morphology, surface acidity property, coordination of Al ions, etc., can determine the interaction with not only the metallic sites but also the reaction-relevant molecules or intermediates.54Table 1 summarizes the recent advances on Pt-based DH catalysts on Al2O3-relevant supports.

From the characterizations and catalytic PDH reaction results, the Pt/θ-Al2O3 catalyst displays higher propylene selectivity and minor coke deposition with higher H/C ratio and graphitization degree in comparison with the Pt/γ-Al2O3 catalyst, reflecting that less severe deep dehydrogenation side reactions occur over the Pt/θ-Al2O3 catalyst with specific pore structure and weaker acidity.55 Furthermore, the existence of abundant chlorine species on these two catalysts after treatment with HCl vapor prevents the Pt particles from sintering and reduces the coke deposition. The effect of the elimination of residual chlorine species from chlorinated platinum precursor has also been investigated on the γ-Al2O3-supported PtSnK catalyst for the PDH reaction.56 For the high-sphericity Al2O3 spheres that are prepared by a modified oil-drop solgel method, the aging temperature determines the pore size and volume as well as the surface acidity.57 The interactions between PtSn species and Al2O3 support aged at different temperatures are distinct. With increasing aging temperature, both the dispersion of Pt and total acid content show volcano-shape patterns, while the interaction between Al2O3 and Sn species is enhanced for inhibiting the reduction of SnOx to metallic Sn0. By proceeding with a facile complex-assisted hydrothermal approach using melamineAl(NO3)3 complex as Al precursor, template and precipitant, a carambola-like Al2O3 with an open structure can be prepared for acting as a proper carrier of PtSn clusters with an intensified interaction of bimetallic Pt and Sn.58 For the PDH reaction at 600 C, the catalyst displays 1.8 times higher TOF value with higher selectivity and stability in comparison with the commercial Al2O3-supported PtSn catalyst, which originate from the enhanced propane activation ability of electron-deficient Pt sites and the mass transfer facilitated by the unique morphology and surface properties. A high strength of Lewis acid sites in Al2O3 can prevent the sintering of PtSn sites by the SMSI effect, while the low amount of Lewis acid sites in Al2O3 can reduce the deposition of coke species during the PtSn/Al2O3-catalyzed PDH reaction.59 For a PtSnNa/Al2O3-based PDH catalyst prepared by a ball milling method, it is observed that the Sn species restrain the deep dehydrogenation pathway and transfer the coke from the Pt sites, while the Na+ species suppress the CC cracking processes.60 Furthermore, the γ-Al2O3 coated on the cordierite with a proper thickness can serve as a practical support for the PtSnNa-based monolithic catalyst, and its good mass transfer performance leads to a steady propylene selectivity in the PDH reaction.61
A γ-Al2O3 nanosheet containing 27% penta-coordinated Al3+ sites serves as a proper anchor to strongly stabilize the raft-like PtSn clusters for enhancing the anti-sintering ability.62,63 The PtSn/Al2O3 nanosheet catalyst displays a high initial conversion of 48.7% and a very small decrease in conversion of 0.17% per hour in a 24 h PDH reaction at 590 C and a WHSV of 9.4 h1, whereas the PtSn/Al2O3 reference catalyst shows a dramatically declined activity from 43.8% to 28.3% within 24 h (Fig. 8a).64 The electronic interaction between Pt and Sn in the PtSn/Al2O3 sheet catalyst is relatively strong, while the electron density and dispersion of Pt sites are increased (Fig. 8b). The sufficient amount of the penta-coordinated Al3+ in Al2O3 is evidenced by the two-dimensional 27Al MQ MAS NMR spectrum (Fig. 8c). The catalyst exhibits a weak interaction with the electron-rich propylene, and thus minimizes the formation of coke species. The presence of the penta-coordinated Al3+ in Al2O3 also contributes to the high dispersion of Pt and Ga species on the support.63 Both the hydrogen spillover and the synergistic function between Pt and reduced Ga2O3 sites are facilitated, consequently promoting the catalytic activity and stability of Pt/Ga/Al2O3 catalyst in the PDH reaction.

Modification by doping has been approved as an effective strategy to improve the catalytic DH performances of the Pt/Al2O3-based catalysts, and the dopants include transition metals or rare earth metals (e.g., Ce, Zr, Y, Mg, etc.) and nonmetals (e.g., carbon and boron species). For instance, the addition of an optimal content of carbon into Al2O3 has been reported to improve the activity and stability of the supported PtSnK catalyst in the PDH reaction due to large specific surface area, weak and moderate acidity and strong resistance to coke.65 The promotion effect of Pt/γ-Al2O3 catalysts with the boron species on reducing the coke deposition and enhancing the propylene selectivity is observed in the PDH reaction.66 The boron promoter exists in an amorphous oxide that finely disperses on both the Al2O3 support and the Pt surface rather than in the reduced state or PtB alloy, removing the medium- and strong-strength acid sites from the Al2O3 support to inhibit the oligomerization of the produced propylene to the coke precursors.
In the case of a PtGa/CeAl2O3 catalyst, the atomic dispersion of Ce on γ-Al2O3via the solgel synthesis chemistry contributes to the stabilization effect of Pt through strong PtOCe bonds (Fig. 9a). In comparison with the impregnated catalyst with a weak interaction between metal and support, the chemically stabilized catalyst shows a more steady activity and a higher selectivity as well as a good regeneration stability for the PDH reaction (Fig. 9b).67 When Ga3+ cations are incorporated into the cubic fluorite CeO2 on Al2O3, the reducibility of CeO2 can be enhanced to promote the desorption of propylene and the elimination of the deposited coke in the PtGa/CeO2Al2O3-catalyzed PDH reaction.68 The addition of a proper amount of Ga species can also decorate and modify the Pt sites via the formation of PtGa alloys. The Y-modified γ-Al2O3 can greatly reduce the acidity of the support and change the interaction with active PtSnIn sites for the PtSnIn/0.6γ-Al2O3 catalyst, while the Zr-modified γ-Al2O3 results in high Pt dispersion for the PtSnIn/0.8ZrAl2O3 catalyst.69,70 These two supported PtSnIn catalysts show above 50% conversion and >97% propylene selectivity in the PDH reactions. A hierarchical MgAl2O4 with flower-like morphology is used to support PtSn bimetals, achieving a high stability in ten cycles of PDH reaction and regeneration, due to the contribution of a great amount of MgAl2O4(111) facets exposed on the support.71

The Al-contained LDH-derived supports also exhibit good properties to enhance the Pt-catalyzed EDH and PDH performances.12,7274 Small raft-like Pt clusters highly disperse on the MgSn(Al)Ox support, and this Pt/MgSn(Al)O@Al2O3 catalyst displays >99% propylene selectivity and 0.96 s1 specific rate in the PDH reaction at 550 C, while >98% selectivity and 1.46 s1 rate can be achieved at 600 C (Fig. 10a and b).72 The confinement of SnIV/II ions in the Mg(Al)O lattices is confirmed by the 119Sn Mssbauer spectra (Fig. 10c), providing a strong interaction with the metal sites for great anti-sintering stability in the long-term reaction. For the PtSn/Mg(Ga)AlOx catalysts, the presence of a moderate amount of Ga in the MgAl LDH matrix significantly reduces the strong acid sites and enhances the interactions between Sn and the support and between Pt and Sn through inhibiting the reduction of SnOx species.73 The Zn additives not only modify the acidic property of the MgAl LDH matrix, but also induce the formation of small PtZn bimetallic nanoparticles on the support. By stabilizing Pt in the active state by Zn, the optimal PtZn/Mg(Zn)AlOx catalyst shows high activity and above 99% selectivity for propylene in the PDH reaction.74

Decorating functional layers on top of the Al2O3 surfaces is also an available approach to modify the structureproperty relationship of the Pt/Al2O3-based catalysts. The oxide-based nano islands decorated on the surface of the Al2O3 support can effectively modify the surface acidbase property and provide new anchor sites for the active metallic species through different interactions. The layered MgAl hydroxides supported on Al2O3 allow the chloroplatinate complex to exchange with their interlayer anions, resulting in the predominant localization of the dispersed Pt sites in the MgAl phase for better anti-coking stability of the Pt catalyst in the PDH reaction.75 A composite catalyst, MgAl-LDHs/Al2O3 fiber, also shows a good PDH performance due to the LDH sheet-promoted dispersion state of active Pt sites and open pore structure.76 The perovskite LaAlO3 nanoparticles can be anchored on γ-Al2O3 through sharing of the AlO bond, and their lattice interstitial sites are beneficial to confining the highly dispersed PtIn bimetallic species with an appropriate In3+/In0 ratio and a weak interaction between Pt and In species.77
2.1.4. Catalysts on zeolite-based supports Zeolites can be widely used as promising porous supports to encapsulate small nanoparticles, nanoclusters and even single-atoms of metals for heterogeneous dehydrogenation catalysis.78,79 To a certain extent, the zeolite provides a confinement effect to stabilize the metal sites against sintering at high operation temperatures or in various reaction atmospheres. The location and structure as well as the properties of the metals in the zeolite are dependent on the encapsulation synthesis method and the physicochemical properties of the selected zeolite. With respect to the former issue, for instance, it is difficult to control the metal states well by using conventional methods such as impregnation or ion exchange.80,81 The multidimensional parameters of the used zeolite support also determine its interactions with metal precursors during the preparation process to construct the metal-zeolite interfaces. Furthermore, the zeolite itself can interact with the reaction-relevant molecules or intermediates in the reaction for changing the pathway. In this section, the Pt-based alkane DH catalysts supported or confined in the mesoporous pure-silica zeolites (e.g., MCM-22 and SBA-15) and the microporous zeolites (e.g., ZSM-5 and beta) would be discussed in detail (Table 2).

A preparation strategy has been reported for the zeolite-confined Pt single-atom and nanocluter catalysts with high stability, which is a transformation process from the two-dimensional ITQ-1 zeolite into the three-dimensional MCM-22 zeolite.82 During the swelling process of layered MWW-structured ITQ-1 by an expanding surfactant, the subnanometric Pt species are incorporated in the internal channels, and the following thermal treatment at 540 C for a removal of the organic agents produces the Pt@MCM-22 catalyst (Fig. 11). The internal dimensions of the cup-like hemi-cages and the supercages of the MCM-22 zeolite are 0.7 and 0.7 × 1.8 nm, respectively. The supercages can theoretically contain the Pt nanoclusters with 1013 atoms. For the as-synthesized Pt@MCM-22 catalyst, most of the Pt species are single-atoms and <0.7 nm clusters captured by the hemi-cages and supercages, exhibiting high structural stability under both thermal and PDH reaction conditions. For the PDH reaction at 550 C, the Pt@MCM-22 catalyst displays a higher activity than that of the impregnated Pt/MCM-22 catalyst with 1.5 nm Pt nanoparticles at the external surfaces. After five reaction-regeneration cycles at 550 C, 10% and >40% losses relative to the initial activity are observed on the confined Pt@MCM-22 and the impregnated Pt/MCM-22 catalyst, respectively.

Mesoporous SBA-15 material is a commonly used support for PtSn-based PDH catalysts, and further modifications such as decorating and doping can improve the catalytic performances. The PtSn catalyst supported on Al2O3-modified SBA-15 (PtSn/Al2O3/SBA-15) shows a higher activity than that of the PtSn/SBA-15 catalyst and a higher stability than that of the PtSn/Al2O3 catalyst for the PDH reactions, due to the mesoporous structure and the enhanced interaction between PtSn and the additive Al2O3 species on the PtSn/Al2O3/SBA-15 catalyst.83 The interaction between Sn species and Al2O3/SBA-15 support can be tuned by the content of Al2O3 additives, and their weaker interaction leads to the formation of PtSn alloys for the increased stability of the PtSn/xAl-SBA-15 catalysts in the PDH reaction.84
The post-impregnation of oxides may cause the formation of large decorators, decreasing the surface area and blocking the mesopores of SBA-15. By performing one-pot hydrothermal synthesis, the Mg and Sn species can be incorporated into the framework of the SBA-15 support to maintain the porous texture and anchor the active Pt-based metals.85,86 The PtSn catalysts on the hydrothermal-synthesized Mg-SBA-15 show more uniform distribution of both Mg and PtSn species and higher specific surface area than the impregnated catalysts.85 In addition, the enhanced interaction between Sn and the support contributes to the stabilization of the oxidative SnOx sites and facilitates the transfer of the carbon deposits from the metal sites to the supports, therefore improving the stability and propylene selectivity in the PDH reactions. Specifically, the PtSn/2Mg-SBA-15 catalyst displays >98% propylene selectivity at 38.0% conversion at 580 C. Similarly, a strong Sn-support interaction is observed on the Pt catalyst on the Sn-SBA-15 support that is prepared by a hydrothermal method.86 At the optimal Sn loading, the Pt/0.5Sn-SBA-15 catalyst exhibits 98.5% propylene selectivity and 43.8% conversion in the PDH reaction at 580 C. The existence of promotors such as Ce, In, La and Fe onto the Pt catalysts supported on Sn-SBA-15 can enhance the propylene generation rate in the PDH reactions, which are related to their regulated redox properties, surface compositions, and lattice oxygen capabilities.87 Among these catalysts, the InPt/Sn-SBA-15 catalyst shows a maximum initial propane conversion, while the FePt/Sn-SBA-15 catalyst shows the best catalytic stability.
The structureactivity relationships have also been established for the subnanometric Pt sites confined in microporous zeolites, including MFI-type zeolites of ZSM-5, silicalite-1 and TS-1, beta zeolites, etc. Considering that these zeolites possess micropores and cavities at different dimensions, one of the fundamental challenges is to precisely and selectively localize the metal sites in the specific position of zeolites, and another one is to stabilize these metal species against Ostwald ripening or sintering at high reaction temperatures under a reductive atmosphere. The strong interaction between the silanol defect sites of hierarchical silicalite-1 zeolite and Pt metals introduces the formation of small Pt nanoparticles with approximately 2 nm size.88 More than 95% propylene selectivity with suppressed oligomerization side reaction is achieved on this promoter-free Pt/silicalite-1 nanosheet catalyst due to favorable diffusion in short paths. To achieve regioselective generation of subnanometric Pt nanoclusters within a pure-silica MFI zeolite, coexistence of the tetrapropylammonium hydroxide (TPA+OH) templates and K+ species is the key influencing factor (Fig. 12a).89 Most Pt atoms are dispersed in the sinusoidal 10MR channels of the MFI zeolite, not only due to the relatively larger space of the channels than the straight channels, but also owing to the occupation of the intersectional voids by the TPA+ templates. The introduction of a moderate amount of K+ to compensate the silanol groups does not affect the hydrothermal synthesis stage, and nonetheless, it significantly suppresses the sintering of Pt nanoclusters into large nanoparticles during the calcination process through a stabilization effect. With the aid of the electronic modification on the Pt sites provided by the atomically dispersed Sn species, the subnanometric K-PtSn@MFI catalyst displays a highly steady and active performance in the PDH reaction at 600 C (Fig. 12b). In the detailed extending work, the structural evolution of this confined catalyst during reduction with H2 is carefully measured, and the PDH performances of these pre-reduced catalysts are also evaluated for acquiring a more refined information of the metal-support interaction (Fig. 13).90 In the pristine K-PtSn@MFI sample after hydrothermal synthesis, Pt, K+ and Sn4+ species atomically dispersed in the sinusoidal channels of the MFI zeolite. During the reduction at 400 C, all Pt atoms but only a few Sn4+ species are reduced, while subnanometric Pt clusters are formed. If the reduction temperature reaches up to 600 C, most of the Sn4+ species are reduced to the Sn2+ species that are still separated with Pt clusters. After extending the reduction time from 1 h to 12 h at 600 C, the migration of partial Sn2+ species towards the Pt cluster occurs to form the bimetallic PtSn clusters that directly contact with the reduced Sn2+ species isolated on the internal wall of the zeolite channel probably through SnOPt bonds. For the K-PtSn@MFI catalysts after pre-reduction treatments at 600 C for different times of 0 to 22 h, their initial specific rates of propylene generation are similar, which are approximately 3.5 s1, while the coke amounts are all below 1 wt%. However, the deactivation constant dramatically decreases from 0.12 to 0.01 h1 with increasing reduction durations for these catalysts. The synergistic effect between the framework Zn species as Lewis acid sites and small-sized PtZn nanoparticles is also observed in the ZnPt/HZSM-5 catalyzed PDH reactions.91 The optimal 10Zn0.1Pt/H-ZSM-5 catalyst consisting of 1000 ppm Pt and 10 wt% Zn displays a high propylene yield of ca. 46% and a good stability over 65 h at 525 C without regeneration procedure or co-feeding of hydrogen. The unique geometric and electronic structure features of the subnanometric bimetallic clusters confined in the zeolites determine the outstanding catalytic alkane dehydrogenation performance.

The encapsulation of ultrasmall PtZn alloy nanoclusters by the nanosized MFI-structure silicalite-1 zeolites is achieved by a ligand-protected direct hydrogen reduction method, and the optimal PtZn4@S-1-H catalyst displays a high propylene generation rate of 65.6 molC3H6 gPt1 h1 and 99% selectivity in the PDH reaction with a WHSV of 108 h1 at 550 C.92 Even the confined monometallic Pt@S-1-H catalyst obtained by reduction shows a greater stability than the calcinated Pt@S-1-C catalyst and the impregnated Pt/S-1-im catalyst, highlighting the advantage of the encapsulation of metals in the zeolites. Furthermore, the promotion effect of the Cs+ additives on the regeneration stability of the catalysts has been observed. Without the addition of the protective agent, PtSn clusters with ca. 1 nm size can be in situ encapsulated inside the high-silica ZSM-5 zeolites through a rapid one-pot synthesis procedure.93 In comparison with the monometallic Pt/ZSM-5 and the impregnated Pt/Sn-ZSM-5-im, the ultrafast-encapsulated Pt/Sn-ZSM-5 catalyst exhibits a superior catalytic stability. Its propane conversion remains as high as 45% after 24 h in the PDH reaction at 600 C. The bimetallic PtCu alloy nanoparticle encapsulated in silicalite-1 shows a superior catalytic performance than the monometallic Pt catalyst in the PDH reaction at 610 C, which was an initial conversion of 46.0% and a propylene selectivity of 93.2%.94 In spite of a coking-preventing performance, gradual deactivation still occurs on this Cu0.6Pt0.1@S-1 catalyst, owing to the aggregation of active metal sites via the Ostwald ripening process under the harsh reaction conditions.
The surface framework defects of silanol nests on the pore walls of the mesoporous MFI-type degallated zeolites can induce the formation of intermetals of Pt and rare-earth element, e.g., PtLa, PtCe and PtY (Fig. 14).95 The presence of the silanol nests allows these rare-earth elements to exist as high-chemical potential single-atom species that prefer to diffuse onto Pt sites in comparison with the bulk oxide forms. The PtLa and PtY bimetallic alloys incorporated in the mesoporous zeolites show a striking enhancement in the catalytic activity, propylene selectivity and stability in 20 days of PDH reactions at 580 C. The presence of the framework-confined Sn species in the dealuminated Si-beta zeolites influences the chemical state and catalytic PDH property of the encapsulated Pt sites.96,97 The introduction of SnCl4 by dry impregnation leads to the formation of tetrahedral coordinated Sn4+ species incorporated into the beta zeolite frameworks.96 Due to strong interactions between Pt and Sn4+ sites, the subnanometric Pt clusters are highly dispersed, displaying >99% propylene selectivity and 2.3 molC3H6 gPt1 h1 generation rate in the PDH reaction at 550 C. The grafting of tributyltin hydride (Bu3SnH) onto the dealuminated beta zeolites produces the formation of the Sn single-site located in the frameworks.97 The grafting of Pt(COD)Me2 and following reductive treatment in H2 result in the homogeneous dispersion of PtSn alloy nanoclusters at the surface of Sn-beta zeolites. Benefiting from the isolation effect and electronic modification effect of Sn species on the Pt sites as well as the confinement effect of zeolites, the PtSn2.00/Sn-beta catalyst shows 114 s1 TOF and above 99% propylene selectivity in the PDH reaction at 570 C.

In view of the fact that the beta and ZSM-5 zeolites are extensively explored for aromatization processes of light hydrocarbons, the presence of the acidic sites may catalyze the transformation of olefins, the target products in the alkane dehydrogenation, into aromatics, for instance, a GaPt/HZSM-5 catalyst with coexistence of metal sites and Brnsted acid sites can tandemly achieve the dehydrogenation of ethane to ethylene and the aromatization of ethylene to benzene and toluene.98100 Therefore, the high-silica or pure-silica zeolites that possess low surface acidity are widely used as the supports to encapsulate the subnanometric Pt metals for the selective DH of alkanes to olefins. Considering the weaker acidity of the TS-1 zeolite relative to the Al-ZSM-5 zeolites that may inhibit side-reactions of CC cracking and coking, TS-1-supported PtSn catalysts are attempted in the PDH reactions.101 The PtSn catalyst in the minimal particle size TS-1 zeolites (100 nm) displays a superior catalytic PDH performance than the catalysts supported on the large-size TS-1 zeolites (0.25.7 μm), owing to the hierarchically porous structure for a promoted mass transportation.102 Furthermore, the surface acidity of the zeolite can also determine the location position and state of the Pt sites. The relatively stronger acid sites of SUZ-4 zeolites can prevent the impregnation of the H2PtCl6 precursors into the channels, and consequently most of the Pt particles disperse on the external surface of the SUZ-4 zeolite.103 In sharp contrast, relatively weaker acidic ZSM-5 zeolites allow most of the Pt species to enter the porous spaces with the coexistence of both small clusters and large particles. The doping modification of the M-silicalite-1 (M = Mg, Al, Fe and In) zeolites shows profound impacts on pore structure, reducibility, acidity and surface content of Pt for the supported bimetallic PtSn catalysts, and therefore changes the catalytic PDH performances.104
2.1.5. Catalysts on other supports The catalytic performances of Pt catalysts supported on other materials for the alkane DH reactions are presented in Table 3. For the Pt/SiO2 catalysts, the SMSI effect between Pt species and SiO2 matrix under high-temperature reduction conditions can modify the geometric and electronic properties of Pt sites.105 The PtSiO2 interaction increases with the reduction temperature, and an optimal SMSI effect leads to the formation of more electron-rich Pt sites and their high accessibility, which are responsible for the high initial activity and the high anti-sintering ability of the Pt/SiO2_1073 K catalyst in the PDH reaction. The Pt nanoparticles embedded in SiO2 supports with a self-assembly structure of nanotubes with vertically aligned nanorods also show a high thermal stability against the PDH reaction at 590 C.106

ZrO2 serves as a widely used support in catalytic reactions due to its high mechanical and thermal stability. It has been reported for the PDH reactions that either the location of the metals on ZrO2 or the doping modification with dopants such as La and Y introduces the formation of the coordinatively unsaturated Zr ions for changing the propylene chemisorption ability.107 By controlling the pH value during the preparation, the Lewis acidity and the oxygen storage capability of the boron-doped ZrO2 supports can be regulated. For the B-ZrO2-supported PtSn catalysts, a moderate metal-support interaction is achieved on the catalyst support that is prepared at pH = 10 for strengthening the interaction between Pt and Sn species and thus facilitating the catalytic PDH performance.108
A commercial TiO2-based material, ETS-2, possesses a high surface area and surface titanate species with a net negative charge, allowing it to serve as a potent ion-exchanger, resulting in the stabilization of the highly dispersed bimetallic PtZn sites by the ETS-2 support.109 By further changing the Zn/Pt ratio and by manipulating the space velocity of the feed gases, the side reactions and coking processes can be suppressed in the EDH reaction.
The nanocarbon-based materials are rarely reported to serve as the supports of Pt sites though they themselves are a group of important catalysts for the alkane DH reactions due to their metallic or semimetallic nature or the defect roles. A Pt/ND@G catalyst is developed for the PDH reaction, which consists of Pt nanoparticles and a coreshell structured nanocarbon support with a nanodiamond core and a defective ultrathin graphene nanoshell.110 An SMSI effect is observed through the electron transfer from the defects on the nanocarbon support to Pt sites, and consequently promotes the anti-sintering ability and the desorption of propylene. The positive roles of defects in carbon nanotubes (CNTs) is also reported for CNT-supported Pt-catalyzed PDH reactions.111 The presence of defects causes an SMSI with Pt to inhibit Pt agglomeration and increase the anti-coking stability, and therefore results in enhanced stability and activity of Pt supported on the defect-rich CNTs than Pt on the defect-poor CNTs.
The ball milled hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) nanosheets with abundant fault edge B-O defects can properly modify the geometric and electronic states and catalytic properties of localized Pt/Cu nanoclusters through strong bonding interactions.112 The Pt/Cu/h-BN-sheet catalyst with only 100 ppm Pt exhibits propylene selectivity of >99% and high propylene formation rate of 7.3 s1 in the PDH reaction at a low temperature of 520 C, which is approximately ten times higher than the best value for the reported Pt/Cu single-atom alloy catalyst.
2.2. CrOx-, VOx- and GaOx-based catalysts
2.2.1. CrOx The supported CrOx-based catalysts in the alkane DH reactions have been studied for several decades, which are reliable for use in the commercial Catofin PDH process. By means of regulating the loading amount, preparation method, supports and promoters, the existing state (isolated ions or aggregated particles) and the valence from 6+ to 2+ can be changed for developing efficient CrOx-based DH catalysts with structural stability and anti-coking ability. The recent progress of Cr-based DH catalysts is summarized in Table 4.

Al2O3 is mostly utilized as a support for active CrOx sites. A rod-shaped porous Al2O3 possessing a weakened surface acidity in comparison with the commercial Al2O3 has been adopted as the support of the active Cr2O3 sites, and this CrAl-800 catalyst shows a significantly lower coke deposition amount than the reference catalyst (3.6% vs. 15.7%) in the PDH reactions at 600 C.113 An enhanced SMSI between Cr species and Al2O3 support through high-temperature reduction treatment by H2 induces the migration of active Cr sites into the substrate layers of Al2O3. Therefore, the desorption barrier of propylene on the catalyst could be reduced for avoiding CC cracking and deep hydrogenation, increasing the catalyst stability and anti-coking ability in the PDH reactions at 580 C.114 The interaction between Cr and support can be modified by the Ce, Zr or Sn additive.115117 For a 5% CeCr/Al2O3 catalyst, the amounts of inactive isolated Cr(IV) site and oxygen vacancy are decreased and increased, respectively, because of a promoted CeCr interaction.115 The Zr-modified Al2O3 support suppresses the formation of CrAl solid solution phase and increases the dispersion degree of CrOx species on the supports for substantially promoting the PDH activity of the Cr/ZrAl2O3 catalyst.116 The addition of a small amount of Sn to the formed Al2O3 not only eliminates the strong acid sites for inhibiting the coke formation but also improves the distribution of Cr active sites for enhanced PDH activity and selectivity.117
The Cr-based catalysts on the commercial silica gel or mesoporous MCM-41 support are also widely studied in the non-oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane and propane and the oxidative dehydrogenation in the presence of CO2.118125 In the case of 2 wt% Cr/MCM-41 catalyst, the coexistence of the CrII and CrIII phases during the PDH reaction is evidenced by the operando XAS characterizations.126 For the Cr/MCM-41 catalyst with a high Cr loading of 15%, isolated CrVI species exist as the inactive sites to be hardly reduced, causing decreased activity and propylene selectivity in the PDH reactions.127 The well-defined model species of CrIII silicate are prepared by the surface organometallic chemistry (Fig. 15a).128 During the PDH reaction, the propane CH bond activation over the CrIIIOSi site is heterolytic cleavage with a σ-bond metathesis character (Fig. 15b). A promotion effect of a pretreatment with ethanol vapor on the PDH activity of Cr/SiO2 catalyst is also reported through reducing the coordinated Cr6+ to the active Cr3+ sites.129

Enhanced PDH performances of Zn- and Zr-promoted CrOx catalysts are achieved.130,131 The addition of ZnO to Cr2O3 causes the formation of a ZnZr2O4 spinel structure with a reduced particle size and an increased content of the defect sites. By modifying the intrinsic activity of the active sites with a significantly declined apparent activation energy, the optimal Zn0.3Cr catalyst displays 31% conversion and 94% propylene selectivity in the PDH reaction at 480 C and 5000 mL gcat1 h1 space velocity. Using CMK-3 as the hard template agent, the CrZrO catalysts possess well-ordered mesoporous structure, large specific surface area and coexisting species of the non-redox Cr3+ and redox Cr5+ and Cr6+ in high dispersion states, which benefit the enhanced catalytic PDH performances. The addition of K dopant into the CrZr matrix further promotes the propylene selectivity (96%) and anti-coking ability. The synergistic effects between Ni promoter and CrOx are also reported to enhance the activity with ca. 24% increase for Cr-Ni/Al2O3-catalzyed PDH reaction.132 The presence of Ni additives plays two roles. One is to form the oligomeric CrOx species, while another one is to form the active Cr3+ sites by reducing the content of Cr6+.
2.2.2. VOx In consideration of the low-price and high-reactivity, the supported VOx catalysts are believed to be one of the most promising alternatives to Pt- and CrOx-based catalysts in the selective DH reactions of light alkanes into olefins. In comparison with the numerous studies that focus on the VOx-catalyzed ODH processes of light alkanes, there are relatively rare reports that are related to the structurereactivity relationship and the catalytic mechanism of non-oxidative DH reactions over the supported VOx catalysts. The VOx/MCM-41 catalysts with highly dispersed VOx species exhibit superior selectivity to propylene and time-on-stream stability than the industrially relevant CrOx/MCM-41 and PtSn/MCM-41 catalysts in several cycles of the non-oxidative PDH reaction and oxidative regeneration.133 Similar to the CrOx-based catalysts that possess the redox of various Cr-relevant surface species during the reactions, including Cr6+, Cr5+, Cr3+ and Cr2+, different kinds of V species are included in the working VOx catalysts, such as monomeric, polymeric and crystalline VOx species with +3+5 valences. The reduction of high-valence V species and/or the sintering, redispersion, hydration or dehydration of V sites may occur in the DH reactions.134 Furthermore, in view of the strong interaction with the oxide supports, the V atoms may embed into the matrix for forming mixed oxides with Al, Zr, Ti, or MgOx. The changes in both structure and chemical state of the active VOx sites are significantly determined by their interaction with the employed supports. The V loading amount, preparation method, the selected support type and the reaction conditions can strongly influence the V-support interaction for tuning the catalytic DH performances (Table 4).
The distribution of the existing states for V species on the supports depends on the loading amount. For the VOx/γ-Al2O3 (120V/Al) catalysts prepared via incipient wetness impregnation, the isolated V, polymetric VOx, and crystallite V2O5 species are formed when the surface density reaches 0.7, 3.9, and 13.1 V nm2, respectively (Fig. 16).135 The apparent activation energy of the PDH reactions declines from 245 to 165 kJ mol1 with increasing V loading in the V/Al catalysts, indicating the structural change in the active V sites over these catalysts. The volcano-shape variation of the TOF values further suggests that the isolated V3+ species are more catalytically active in comparison with other V sites. The in situ DRIFT spectral results demonstrate that the vanadium propyl (V-C3H7) and vanadium propenyl (V-C3H5) species may serve as the reaction intermediates in the hydrogen abstraction of propane and further transformation into propylene. By regulating the loading amount of the vanadyl acetylacetonate to be grafted on the mesoporous MCM-41 support, the isolated and oligomerized VOx species can be constructed with varied densities of the surface VOx sites from 0.05 to 1.67 nm2. The direct correlations between the apparent TOF value, the Lewis acidity and the mean number of the VOV bonds around a central V cation can explain the high intrinsic activity and anti-coking stability of the isolated V4+ and V3+ sites in the catalytic PDH reaction.136 By means of DFT calculations on a series of single metal models including V, Cr, Mn, Ru, Rh, Pt, etc., it is predicted that the single V atom anchored on the graphitic carbon nitride (V1/g-C3N4) may exhibit satisfactory activity, selectivity and thermal stability for the non-oxidative PDH reaction, due to the contribution of the low-coordinated 3d orbitals of single V atom to the facile desorption of propylene through the inhibition of the di-σ binding mode of propylene on the single V atom.137

The structural and catalytic properties of VOx-based catalysts are also improved by the selected support. A less than one monolayer Si/Al ratio of Al2O3SiO2 (Siral) strongly affects the catalytic activity and stability of the supported VOx species for the PDH reaction.138 The VOx/Al2O3SiO2 catalysts based on the Siral supports with 10 and 1 wt% of SiO2 show the highest space-time yields of 146 and 158 kgC3H6 mcat3 h1 at a propane conversion of 30% at 550 C, respectively, and these values are approximately two times higher than that delivered by the VOx/MCM-41 catalyst with a similar vanadium loading. Most of the catalysts except for one containing 70 wt% of SiO2 in the support can restore their initial activity even after ten cycles of dehydrogenation reaction and oxidative regeneration. For the VOx/Al2O3 catalysts, their stability in PDH reactions can be substantially improved by the phosphorus modification through tuning the surface acidity and separating the polymerized VOx species as well as weakening the interaction between VOx species and Al2O3 matrix.139 The anti-coking stability of a 12V/Al2O3 catalyst can be significantly improved by the modification using a small amount of MgO additives through enhancing the dispersion of the V2O5 nanoparticles into two-dimensional VOx species.140 By changing the support from commercial γ-Al2O3 to ZrO2, a sixfold increased TOF value is achieved on the supported VOx catalyst for the PDH reaction, and the reaction rate increases linearly with increasing V loading until the loading reaches 2 wt% (Fig. 17a).141 This promotion effect benefits from the formation of low coordinated V species in the VOx/ZrO2 catalyst with a high ability and a low energy barrier for propane CH activation (Fig. 17bd). Based on the H2-TPR profiles, in situ Raman and XPS spectra, and the oxygen vacancy formation energies from DFT calculation results, the reduction of VO bonds including VO, VOV and VOZr can be facilitated by the specific interaction between VOx and ZrO2. The MgOZrO2 nanocomposite support with an optimal Mg/Zr ratio promotes the high dispersion of active VOx species for increasing both the activity and stability in the EDH reaction at 700 C.142

Porous supports are employed to localize VOx species by providing the specific VOx-support interactions through their unique properties. The dendritic mesoporous silica nanoparticles (DMSNs) possess a well-defined 3D center-radial mesopore structure and a large pore diameter, allowing the isolated VO4 active sites to highly disperse with an appropriate concentration and facile accessibility and improving the internal diffusion of the relevant reactants.143 For mesoporous Al2O3 supported VOx catalysts, the higher crystallization temperature for Al2O3 supports prefers to form the polymerized VOx species, which are more active and stable than the isolated ones for the PDH reaction.144 Nonetheless, a crystallization temperature at 100 C also leads to an enhanced surface acidity for increased amount and graphitization degree of the deposited coke species. A 3 wt% V/SiBeta catalyst containing isolated VOx species in monolayer exhibits 40% propane conversion and 90% propylene selectivity at 600 C and 4000 mL g1 h1.145 The optimal catalytic activity is contributed to the maximum amount of the acid sites that originate from the VOSi bridges in the entirely monomeric VOx catalyst supported on the Si-beta zeolites. The porous VOx-doped SiO2 catalysts can be obtained via a one-step hydrothermal synthesis, and their structure and catalytic PDH performance can be regulated by proceeding the gelation and calcination at proper temperatures.146 For the 60-VOxSiO2-580 catalyst (60 and 580 represent the temperature of gelation and calcination, respectively), the propane conversion shows a decrease from 55% to 45% within a 4 h PDH reaction, and the propylene selectivity remains 91% over eight cycles of reaction and regeneration. Furthermore, the reducibility of VOx species is similar for the fresh and regenerated catalysts, while the amount of the deposited coke remains constant for the spent catalyst after the first and the eighth cycles. By changing the vanadium precursors such as ammonium meta-vanadate (NH4VO3; VO3, and V5+), vanadium acetylacetonate [V(acac)3; organic complex, V3+], and vanadyl sulfate (VOSO4; VO2+, and V4+), the structureperformance relationship of the porous VOxSiO2 catalysts can be further optimized.147
The multiple effect of the hydroxyl groups exists in the synthesis of the VOx catalysts and in the VOx-catalyzed DH reactions. During the catalyst preparation stage, the OH groups can serve as effective anchoring sites for the V-precursors to achieve the good dispersion of VOx species on the supports. On the other hand, the detrimental OH groups can also be formed in the pre-reduction of VOx catalysts by H2 feed gas and coexist with the reduced V4+ and/or V3+ sites.148 The presence of surface OH groups on the VOx/Al2O3 catalysts are proved to be strongly connected with the intrinsic PDH activity and the coke formation process, based on the results of the in situ DRIFT spectral experiments and DFT calculations.149 The density of surface OH groups can be increased by increasing H2 reduction time, and both the initial activity and relative deactivation rate are negatively related with the OH density (Fig. 18a and b). To further reveal the roles of OH groups in the VOx-catalyzed PDH reactions, three models of γ-Al2O3-supported dimer V2OxHy are constructed for comparatively analyzing, and V2O5, V2O5H2 and V2O3 stand for different pretreated catalyst structures, respectively (Fig. 18c). The OH group in the V2O5H2 structure does not directly participate in the propane CH bond cleavage; however, it leads to the highest reaction energy barrier in comparison with the non-reduced V2O5 and fully reduced V2O3 structures (Fig. 18d). Furthermore, the existing OH group can block the exposure of V ions for enhancing the desorption of propylene and preventing the formation of coke species, and consequently reducing the catalytic activity but promoting the stability.

In the initial period of the dehydrogenation reactions, in addition to the reduction of high-valence V5+ to low-valence V4+ and/or V3+ species, dynamic change of other V-relevant sites can also occur; for instance, an oxidative dehydrogenation pathway along with a consumption of the top VO group exists in the VOx-catalyzed PDH reaction.150 For monomer, dimer and crystalline VOx species supported on Al2O3, their VO groups initially contribute to the formation of H2O and CH3CO*CH3 intermediates in the ODH stage. After the loss of the VO group, the non-oxidative DH pathway commences to take the dominant place over AlOV sites, suggesting the high reactivity of VO with propane molecule in comparison with the bridged and low-coordinated V sites.
2.2.3. GaOx The Ga/H-ZSM-5 zeolites are employed as bifunctional catalysts in the commercial manufacturing process of the propane aromatization reaction.151 It is believed that the Ga-relevant sites are responsible for the propane dehydrogenation, while the Brnsted acid sites catalyze the further transformation reactions of propylene into aromatics including oligomerization and deep dehydrogenation. The product distribution depends on the structural constitution of both sites, and propylene can be selectively produced by the Ga-based catalysts containing few acid sites.152 In the case of the most heavily investigated Ga-ZSM-5 systems, various types of Ga-involved sites exist and have been proposed to be capable of selective activation of CH bonds of ethane and propane, for instance, GaOx clusters in the channels, isolated Ga3+, Ga+, [GaO]+, [Ga(OH)]2+, [Ga(OH)2]+, [GaH2]+, [GaH]2+ and [Ga2O2]+ on the framework or extra-framework of the zeolites.153159
According to the examination results of the free energies for the alkane dehydrogenation reactions over Ga/H-ZSM-5 zeolites, [GaH2]+ and [GaH]2+ serve as the stable Ga cationic species in the reduced catalyst, showing higher activity in comparison with the isolated Brnsted acid site and the Ga+ site. [GaH]2+ is the most active dehydrogenation site, due to the enthalpic stabilization effect of CH cleavage transition states (TSs) via alkyl and carbenium dehydrogenation routes.160 The kinetic results demonstrate that [GaH]2+ cations in the Ga/H-MFI zeolite display two orders of magnitude higher TOF for PDH relative to cracking, and one order of magnitude higher than the corresponding TOFs over the Ga-free H-MFI zeolite.161 The dehydrogenation and cracking of propane are both accomplished through the heterolytic dissociation at [GaH]2+ sites to form [C3H7GaH]+H+ cation pairs. The reaction rates for these two pathways are weakly dependent on the temperature (Fig. 19a, b and d, e), and their reaction rate ratio is independent of C3H8 and H2 partial pressures (Fig. 19c and f). The β-H elimination from the C3H7 fragment is identified as the rate-determining step for the PDH pathway, while the attack of CC bond in the same propyl fragment by the Brnsted acid sites is regarded as the rate-determining step for cracking. In view of the reaction between hydrogen and [GaH]2+ cations to form [GaH2]+-H+ cation pairs, an inhibition effect is observed on both dehydrogenation and cracking of propane.

By regulating the ratio of Ga/Al for the Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts, the distribution of Ga+, Brnsted acid sites and GaOx species can be controlled, and GaOx clusters are formed at high Ga/Al ratios (>1/2), while a 1/1 ratio of Ga+ to Brnsted acid sites is achieved at a Ga/Al ratio with 1/2 for creating a LewisBrnsted acid pair.162 The 1/2 Ga/Al Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalyst with predominant acid pairs displays an activity more than 300 times higher than the catalyst with isolated Brnsted acid sites only and the catalyst with GaOx species only. A bifunctional PDH mechanism is proposed based on the kinetic data and theoretical calculation results. The strong Lewis acid [GaH]2+ generated from protonation of Ga+ by the Brnsted acid site coordinates with the basic framework oxygen of the Brnsted acid site, heterolytically activating the CH bond of propane with a lower intrinsic enthalpy. The presence of the Brnsted acid site also sharply reduces the energy barrier for the monomolecular elimination of H2 by recombination with a hydride.
The addition of 3-mercaptopropyl-trimethoxysilane (MPS) during the synthesis of the gallosilicate MFI zeolites causes significantly increased content of the strong Lewis acid sites and a higher ratio of Lewis to Brnsted acidity, for enhancing the PDH activity and propylene selectivity.163 The hierarchical Ga-MFI zeolite catalysts are developed through the repetitive branching synthesis strategy or the utilization of long chain alkyl structure directing agents, and their superior PDH performances, 26 times higher conversion and 10100% increased propylene selectivity, are obtained in comparison with those over the bulk Ga-MFI catalyst.164 The diffusion-limitation issue does not exist in either catalyst, whereas a considerably increased content of the Lewis acid sites is observed on the hierarchical catalyst compared with the bulk one. MPS additive-caused promotion effect on the PDH performance is also observed on these hierarchical Ga-MFI zeolite catalysts.
The PDH reactions over Ga catalysts on beta zeolite, SiO2 and Al2O3 supports are also investigated, and the active sites depend on the character of the support and the synthesis method. The hydrothermal-prepared Ga-incorporated beta zeolites with high Si/Ga ratios are reported to be more active in the catalytic PDH reaction relative to the low-silica or Na-modified Ga-beta zeolites as well as the impregnated Ga catalyst on dealuminated beta zeolite, due to the large microporosity and the presence of Brnsted acidity.165 GaH-beta zeolite and GaSiO2 catalysts are synthesized by grafting surface organometallic Ga species onto the supports, and similar XANES spectra for these two catalysts are observed under reducing conditions at high temperatures, which are attributed to the three-coordinate gallium alkyl species.153 These results suggest that the Ga3+ alkyls and hydride intermediates may be mechanistically involved in the CH activation in PDH reactions, and the Ga3+ state is stable that unlikely reduces into Ga+. The different support effects between Ga/γ-Al2O3 and Ga/SiO2 catalysts prepared by grafting Ga(i-Bu)3 are comparatively analyzed by spectral characterizations.166 Mononuclear Ga species exist as the major surface organometallic sites in Ga/γ-Al2O3 catalysts through selective protonolysis of the precursor at individual hydroxyl groups, whereas dinuclear Ga2 species dominate in Ga/SiO2 catalysts due to the transfer of the isobutyl group to the Si site combining with the protonolysis process (Fig. 20). Considering that the AlOGa bond facilitates the heterolytic activation of propane CH bond, the mononuclear Ga1 sites supported on γ-Al2O3 display a significantly higher PDH activity than the dinuclear Ga2Ox sites on SiO2. For the modified Ga-α-Al2O3 catalyst with Ba, the high dispersion state of β-Ga2O3 species on the α-Al2O3 is confirmed to be independent of the presence of Ba additives, and the tetrahedrally coordinated Ga sites are covered with Ba atoms.167 The Ga-α-Al2O3 catalyst with 0.10 Ba/Ga ratio displays a high catalytic activity, 98% selectivity and low carbon formation on catalytic EDH reaction even in the presence of steam. The DFT calculation results of the EDH and PDH reactions on the Ga-doped and undoped γ-Al2O3(100) models demonstrate that the Ga modification can significantly improve the catalytic activity through the concerted and stepwise mechanisms with decreased CH activation energy barriers.168 The surface acidbase property of the GaAl2O3 catalysts determines the binding energy of dissociated hydrogen, which serves as a descriptor to predict the overall dehydrogenation reaction rates.

2.3. Co/CoOx-, Fe/FeOx- and Sn/SnOx-based catalysts
2.3.1. Co and CoOx For the Co-catalyzed activation and functionalization of CH bonds in the hydrocarbons, such as direct and oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes and cycloalkanes, their development has achieved notable success.169 The metallic Co0, oxidized Co+, Co2+ and Co3+ in isolation or aggregation state are identified as the active sites for the CH activation of the low-carbon alkanes.170176 The structureperformance relationships of Co-based DH catalysts are reviewed and their corresponding possible reaction mechanisms are also discussed in this section (Table 5).

Combined structural characterizations, kinetic analyses and theoretical calculations are performed to investigate the PDH processes over the single-site, high-spin, tetrahedral Co2+ species on SiO2 supports.177,178 These Co2+ sites can be prepared by grafting either with CoIII(NH3)6Cl3 or with CoIII(HMDS)2(THF) as the precursor and sequent thermal treatments. As evidenced by the in situ XAS and ex situ EPR and Raman spectral results, the structure and state of the isolated Co2+ on SiO2 are stable against the oxidation by air and the reduction by H2 or propane. A complete selective dehydrogenation step of propane to propylene includes the activation of CH bonds in propane molecules through a heterolytic cleavage across a CoOsupport bond without Co2+ redox and the sequent β-hydride elimination (Fig. 21). The formation of alkyl radicals by abstracting a proton may not occur during the Co2+/SiO2-catalyzed PDH reaction, leading to a fairly high selectivity to propylene. Nonetheless, at a high reaction temperature, the HH bond activation and the propylene hydrogenation may still be realized by the same active sites.

The structure and catalytic properties of Co2+-exchanged H-ZSM-5 catalysts have also been discussed for the dehydrogenation of alkanes.179,180 The predominant Co2+OCo2+ dimers and a small amount of Co2+ monomers coexist in the H-ZSM-5 zeolites, bridging two next-nearest neighbor Al sites. The detailed kinetics analyses demonstrate that the rate constant of propane dehydrogenation increases with increasing Co/Al ratio, because the Co cations are responsible for both dissociative adsorption and recombinative desorption of hydrogen. On the other hand, the rate constant of propane CC cracking is related to the zeolite acid sites but not to the Co sites. For the EDH reactions over CoOx catalysts supported on ZSM-5 zeolites with low Si/Al ratios, the highly dispersed Co2+ species are considered as the active sites to efficiently achieve the adsorptive dissociation and activation of ethane, whereas the metallic Co0 sites that originate from the Co2+ reduction result in the catalyst deactivation.181
Higher catalytic activity and propylene selectivity are obtained on the Zr-modified Co2+/SiO2 catalyst rather than the non-modified one in the PDH reaction at 550 C.182 The isolated Zr sites on SiO2 are created by organometallic synthesis using Zr(OBu)4 as a precursor, while the isolated tetrahedral Co2+ ions are anchored by the Zr-involved sites (e.g., SiOZrO) through strong electrostatic adsorption. Due to the well-tuned oxygen donation ability and CoO bond strength, the heterolytic CH cleavage can easily occur. For the Co-contained cluster sites supported on Zr-based nodes (MOF-type NU-1000 support), their CH activation ability can be regulated by the doping of a second metal.183 These bimetallic CoM (M = Ag, Ni, Zn, Cu, Fe, Mn, Ti and Mo) oxide clusters consist of oxygen atoms connecting to a Co atom and an M atom, exhibiting distinct differences in the spin density and positive partial charge of the bridge oxygen during the reactions. In view of the diversity in the hydrogen-abstracting and alkane-adsorption abilities among these CoOM clusters, the energy barrier for the propane CH activation varies from 56.9 to 9.3 kcal mol1.
The isolated Co2+ or highly dispersed Co0 sites on Al2O3 support show high propylene selectivity and high initial activity for the PDH reactions, suggesting that the state of Co species play a critical role.184190 For the Co/Al2O3 catalysts prepared by incipient wetness impregnation of γ-Al2O3 with cobalt nitrate, the Co loading at lower levels (<10%) results in the formation of the surface CoAl spinel with tetrahedral Co2+ ions that contribute to selectively activating the CH bonds of propane and to producing propylene.184 However, the Co/Al2O3 catalysts with a higher Co loading of >10% consist of only large Co3O4 assemblies that can be easily reduced to metallic Co particles to cause dramatically serious side-reactions including CC cracking and coking (Fig. 22). Specifically, these large Co0 grains in the reduced catalysts can be reoxidized during a post-treatment under mild conditions, and transformed into the highly disperse metallic Co0 on the Al2O3 surface for consequently enhancing the propylene selectivity.185 The presence of sulfate species has been proved to promote the dispersion of the active CoOx sites on Al2O3 surfaces and suppresses the reduction into metallic Co0 sites through the interaction between SO42 and Co species.186

The Al2O3 morphology can significantly affect the structure and the catalytic property of the isolated Co2+ ions as the active sites. For instance, these Co2+ sites exist in the mesoporous CoAl2O4 spinel catalysts that are prepared by a one-step evaporation-induced self-assembly (EISA) method, displaying 80% propylene selectivity in the PDH reaction and TOF values of 5.1 and 23.0 h1 at 550 and 600 C, respectively.187 Providing different interactions, three types of Al2O3 supports including nano-sheets (NSs), nano-fibers (NFs) and nano-plates (NPs) with different distributions of Lewis acidity are employed to localize Co species through wetness impregnation.188 A stronger interaction between Co and Al2O3-NS rather than Al2O3-NF and Al2O3-NP is observed. The tetrahedrally coordinated Co2+ sites in the Co/Al2O3-NS catalyst lead to a high propylene selectivity, whereas the metallic Co species originating from the easily reduced Co3O4 species that exist in the Co/Al2O3-NP catalyst are responsible for the formation of C12 by-products and coke. A strong interaction between the Co/Al2O3-NS catalyst and propylene at 550 C is also evidenced by the in situ DRIFT spectral analyses, and nonetheless, a lower coking reaction rate and a low graphitization degree for the deposited coke are observed on the Co/Al2O3-NS catalyst. The doping of iron into the CoOx species supported on the Al2O3 nanosheets can further promote the catalytic activity and propylene selectivity of the Co-catalyzed PDH reaction, which benefits from the strong interaction between Fe and the oxygen ligand for weakening the π domination of oxygen into the adjacent Co site as well as from the prohibition effect on the reduction of Co2+ sites.189 The synergistic effect of the active Co2+ sites and the coordinately unsaturated Alcus sites may also contribute to the enhanced PDH activity.
The tetrahedral Co2+ species in isolation state can also be stabilized by γ-Al2O3 nanosheets with <6 nm thickness through a one-step hydrothermal synthesis, and this CoAl2O3-HT catalyst exhibits a high specific activity of >16 mmol g1 h1 with >97% C3H6 selectivity in the PDH reaction at 590 C.190 Striking contrasts exist with respect to the structure and catalytic properties of the CoAl2O3-HT catalyst and the Co/Al2O3-IMP as the reference catalyst that is prepared by incipient wetness impregnation. The 5 nm Co3O4 nanoparticles disperse on the surface of the Al2O3 support for the Co/Al2O3-IMP catalyst, whereas the Co2+ ions embed into the Al2O3 matrix and occupy the tetrahedral Al3+ sites to form a local spinel structure. These Co2+ sites in the CoAl2O3-HT catalyst are structurally stable against the reductive and PDH reaction atmospheres due to the strong stabilization effect from the Al2O3 matrix. Lower apparent activation energy, lower amount of coke, and easier desorption of propylene are observed on CoAl2O3-HT than Co/Al2O3-IMP (Fig. 23AC), resulting in a high propylene selectivity and a high anti-coking stability. As the Co loading increases for the CoAl2O3-HT catalysts, the transformation of isolated Co2+ to aggregated CoOx nanoparticle occurs (Fig. 23DF), which leads to the severe coke formation and structural change of CoOx sites during the PDH reactions. The effects of Si-additive modification on the Co2+Al2O3 catalysts are further investigated.191 The Si addition introduces a number of Brnsted acid sites without changing the nano-sheet structure and tetrahedral Co2+ coordination. The Si-modified catalyst displays an enhanced PDH stability in comparison with the unmodified catalyst, due to a relatively lower graphitization degree of the coke species and a higher proportion of the highly reactive coke species toward hydrogenation and methanation reactions. It is also found that the co-fed propylene regulates the coking reaction rate but not the coke distribution, suggesting that the interaction with propylene determines the anti-coking stability of Co2+-based PDH catalysts.

The ultrasmall metallic Co0 clusters confined in the dealuminated beta zeolite have been recently reported to be capable of efficiently catalyzing the PDH reactions, and the optimal 0.5 wt% Co@Sibeta catalyst displays 57% initial conversion and 96% propylene selectivity in the PDH reaction at 600 C.192 The highly dispersed CoOx species are anchored on the vacant T-sites (with silanols) of Sibeta zeolite in the as-obtained catalyst, and the transformation of these reducible CoOx into the metallic Co can easily occur during the PDH reactions.
2.3.2. Fe and FeOx Al2O3-supported Fe and Fe2+ species obtained from the pre-reduction of the 10FeAl catalyst by CO or H2 are catalytically active and selective for PDH reactions, because of the elimination of the surface electronegative oxygen species that are responsible for suppressing the propylene cracking and the formation of coke species.193 The modification of Fe/Al2O3 catalyst with P-additives promotes the activity in the PDH reactions, and the 1Fe:P/Al2O3 catalyst displays >80% propylene selectivity and a 19 h1 TOF value.194 The metallic Fe0 species exist in the catalyst with a low propylene selectivity during the initial reaction stage, and sequentially transform into the iron carbide species in the further steady-state reaction, which contribute to high selectivity and activity. It should be noted that the FexC phase is also observed in the spent 10FeAl catalyst after the PDH reactions.193 The sulfated Al2O3-supported Fe2O3 catalysts with specific interaction through FeOS bonds are reported to be active in the PDH reactions due to the enhanced adsorption ability of propane.195,196 Nevertheless, an irreversible deactivation issue remains in view of the reduction and loss of the functional sulfate species. A superior performance of the Fe/ZSM-5 catalyst than that of the Fe/Al2O3 catalyst is observed in the hydrogenation of ethane to ethylene.197 The metallic Fe0 sites are formed from the reduction of oxide during the EDH reaction, while the carburized iron species are also generated to serve as more stable active sites. A relatively weak surface acidity and a weak binding strength of ethylene on Fe/ZSM-5 zeolite catalysts facilitate the desorption of ethylene for suppressing the deep dehydrogenation and coke formation.
The isolated framework Fe2+ in MFI-type zeolites is proved to be the active site responsible for the catalytic dehydrogenation reactions of ethane and propane.198200 The H-[Fe]ZSM-5 catalyst after mild calcination at 753 K possesses framework Fe species as the most important sites.198 These Fe species migrate to extra-framework positions during steaming at 700 oC, which also serve as the active sites for the PDH reactions. The H-[Fe]ZSM-5 catalyst with a Si/Fe ratio of 26 shows high propylene selectivity, when the propylene formation rate is 20 times higher than the cracking reaction rate, whereas the H-[Al]ZSM-5 catalyst with a Si/Al ratio of 26 exhibits a lower propylene selectivity so that the ratio of dehydrogenation to cracking is as low as 0.36. In spite of structural similarity between H-[Fe]ZSM-5 and H-[Al]ZSM-5, their reactions proceed through different catalytic mechanisms. The dehydrogenation of propane to propylene is kinetically favored over the CC cracking over the H-[Fe]ZSM-5 catalyst due to the lower stability of ethene radical cations relative to propylene radical cations.199 A modified hydrothermal synthesis using the coordinated complex of ethylenediaminetetraacetic iron (Fe-EDTA) produces zeolite-supported Fe catalyst (FeS-1-EDTA) with isolated Feδ+ sites incorporated into the pure-silica silicalite-1 frameworks.200 Benefiting from the easy desorption property of ethylene and hydrogen products and the good anti-coking ability, the optimal FeS-1-EDTA catalyst displays great stability with 26.3% conversion and over 97.5% selectivity in 200 h of ethane dehydrogenation reaction at 600 oC.
Employing the SOMC method using a precursor of Fe(oCp)2 (bis(2,4-dimethyl-1,3-pentadienide) iron(ii)) and high-temperature hydrogen reduction treatment, SiO2-supported isolate and stable FeII species in three coordination are constructed as the active sites for selectively catalyzing the PDH reaction through a non-redox mechanism.201 With >99% propylene selectivity, the specific reaction rate is maintained at 3.13.9 × 104 s1 within 18 h of reaction. Either the supported metallic Fe(0) or FeOx nanoparticles can be obtained via the grafting procedure, and nonetheless, these sites exhibit relatively low activities and propylene selectivity. A sulfated Fe/SiO2 catalyst containing 5 wt% SO42 and 20 wt% Fe by impregnation synthesis is adopted in the PDH reaction with co-feeding of H2S gas.202 The Fe1-xS phase is considered as the active site for the reaction and its structural stability can be promoted by the co-fed H2S.
2.3.3. Sn and SnOx The promotion effects of Sn species in Pt-based alkane dehydrogenation catalysts through the geometric and electronic modifications have been widely studied since 1960s, as discussed in the previous sections. However, Sn alone can play the role of the active sites in the dehydrogenation reactions instead of the promoters (Table 5).203207 The metallic Sn/SiO2 catalyst exhibits comparable performance to those of KCr2O3/Al2O3 and KPtSn/Al2O3-based catalysts for PDH reactions.203 To introduce Pd species as a hydrogenation-active promoter and an anchor can further enhance the anti-coking ability and structural stability of the active Sn species. The SnPd/SiO2 catalyst retains 90% propylene selectivity, 35% conversion, and stable activity for 168 h without regeneration in the PDH reaction at 600 C and 120 h1 gas space velocity. In addition to the metallic Sn sites, the isolated or polymeric Sn2+ sites are also active for the PDH reactions. For the SnO2/SiO2 catalyst, the crystalline SnO2 is fully reduced to metallic Sn after high-temperature reduction by H2, whereas the isolated Sn2+ species can be stabilized by their strong interactions with SiO2 matrix. These isolated Sn2+ sites exhibit higher activity and stability than the metallic Sn0 sites for the PDH reaction.204 The stabilization of Sn species can also be achieved by the incorporation of the hexagonal mesoporous silica (HMS) support through the inhibition effect of the reduction of Sn2+-to-Sn0 due to the strong SnOSi bonds.205 The Sn-HMS catalyst exhibits significantly higher propane conversion of approximately 40% and better long-term stability of up to 170 h, even after three cycles of 600 C PDH reaction and oxidative regeneration (Fig. 24). Such a strong interaction is also observed on Sn-containing dendritic mesoporous silica nanoparticle (Sn-DMSN) catalysts, contributing to the high stability of the PDH catalysts.206 The highly dispersed SnOx species show a superior activity than that of the polymetric SnOx or crystalline SnO2 species in the Sn-DMSNs-catalyzed PDH reactions. For the NiSn/SiO2 catalyst, polymeric Sn2+ species and the Ni3Sn2 alloy nanoparticles coexist. The former species are active for the PDH to propylene, while the latter species act as a promoter for accelerating the hydrogen desorption and facilitating the regeneration of active Sn2+ sites.207

2.4. ZnOx-Based catalysts
Either nanosized ZnO assemblies or single-site Zn2+ ions have been reported to be catalytically active in the alkane dehydrogenation reactions, as illustrated in Table 6. The high-silica zeolite-supported ZnO nanoclusters show over 90% propylene selectivity in the PDH reactions. The dealuminated beta zeolite consists of a large amount of vacant T-atom sites associated with silanol groups, providing the hostguest interaction for constraining massive small ZnO nanoclusters anchored in the zeolite frameworks rather than being located on the external surfaces. These highly dispersed ZnO species with the absence of the strong acid sites in the dealuminated beta zeolite contribute to the high selectivity for propylene.208 As the supports for the small ZnO cluster catalysts in the PDH reactions, the HZSM-5 zeolite with a high Si/Al ratio of 250 leads to higher propylene selectivity and stability than those with lower ratios (3080).209 By encapsulating 24 nm ZnO nanoparticles into a N-doped carbon (NC) layer in situ grown from the carbonization of zeolitic imidazolate framework-8 (ZIF-8) on the silicalite-1 support, the composite ZnO@NC/S-1 catalyst shows >90% propylene selectivity at 44.4% conversion in the PDH reaction at 600 C.210 The presence of the NC layer protects the ZnO species from sintering and volatilization even at a high temperature of 700 C. Considering that the NC layer may be oxidized in the catalyst regeneration stage and lose the functions, the treatment parameters for the coke removal need to be optimized. A ZnNb2O6 phase, which is prepared by controlling the calcination temperature and the ratio between ZnO and Nb2O5 precursors, displays 84% propylene selectivity at 28.1% conversion in the PDH reaction at 600 C due to a synergetic effect with ZnO species.211 However, both the coking issue and the loss of ZnO sites through the transformation into the Zn3Nb2O8 phase cause the fast reversible deactivation of the catalyst. In a ZnOx catalyst supported on rutile TiO2 for the selective PDH reactions, the small Zn1-3Ox cluster with 13 Zn atoms rather than the rhombohedral ZnTiO3 phase is identified as the active site.212 The modification with ZrO2 additives inhibits the formation of the detrimental ZnTiO3 phase, and contributes to enhance the intrinsic activity, which benefits from the stronger interaction of ZnOx with ZrO2 relative to that with the TiO2 support. It is also found that a trace amount of platinum (0.1 wt %) has profound enhancement effects on the catalytic PDH performance of ZnO/Al2O3 catalysts with improved CH activation and hydrogen desorption through increasing the Lewis acidity of Zn2+.213

The ZnO clusters and isolated Zn(OH)+ species highly dispersed on the internal and external surfaces of HZSM-5 and HY zeolites are obtained by the ALD method using diethyl zinc as the precursor.214 After performing 2 ALD cycles, the amorphous ZnO species exist in the HZSM-5-supported catalyst with partially removed Brnsted acid sites, leading to the oligomerization and cyclization of propylene and the formation of aromatics in the PDH reaction. On the other hand, the nano-crystallite ZnO modifies the HY zeolite by completely eliminating the Brnsted acid sites but increasing the content of the strong Lewis acid sites, showing a higher propylene selectivity than the ZnO/HZSM-5 catalyst. If the fabrication of Zn species is performed for only 1 or 2 ALD cycles, isolated Zn(OH)+ sites dominate in the catalysts, displaying a higher catalytic activity for the propane conversion. It has been also reported that the Zn/ZSM-5 catalysts prepared by incipient wetness impregnation (IWI) and ion exchange (IE) consist of extra-framework Zn species with a high heterogeneity degree, including isolated Zn2+ cations, multinuclear oxygenate clusters and bulk ZnO aggregates, while the catalyst prepared by chemical vapor deposition (CVD) predominantly contains isolated Zn2+ ions that originate from the reduction of the [ZnCH3]+ product in the stoichiometric reaction between the Brnsted acid protons and dimethyl zinc.215 The isolated Zn2+ sites exhibit lower activity than the clustered oxygenated zinc species in the PDH reactions, and nonetheless, they can be transformed into the highly dispersed oxygenated complexes with enhanced initial activity either through an oxidation pretreatment before the reaction or through co-feeding of steam at a moderate concentration during the reaction. These complexes are significantly active compared with the agglomerated ZnO species for the PDH reactions.
The ethane dehydrogenation catalyzed by three types of the isolated Zn cations in HZSM-5, which are assumed to mainly exist in the Zn2+ ion-exchanged catalysts, is also modeled by the theoretical calculations.216 The Zn2+ in the vicinity of paired Al centers possesses the lowest free energy in the ethane CH activation in comparison with those of Zn(OH)+ and ZnH+ in the vicinity of one isolated Al site, due to the assisting role of the second Al center through generating a basic framework oxygen center to participate in the reaction. For the Zn(OH)+ and ZnH+ models lacking the second Al center, the transformation of the stable ZnH+ or Zn(C2H5)+ intermediates with a higher energy barrier cannot further proceed, causing the dehydrogenation reaction to be blocked.
In addition to the single-site Zn2+ in the zeolite frameworks, those onto SiO2 and ZrO2 matrixes are also catalytically active in the PDH reactions.217219 For instance, a 4 wt% Zn/TiZrOx catalyst displays a propylene yield of 1.25 kgC3H6 kgcat1 h1 at a propane conversion of 30% with a propylene selectivity of 95% in the PDH reaction at 550 C.217 The isolated tri-coordinated Zn2+ species rather than the Zrcus sites are identified as the active sites, which also show a low ability of coke formation for allowing the catalyst to extend the service life. An increased degree of ZnOx agglomeration causes a higher rate of coking reaction. Furthermore, the structure of Zn2+-containing ZrO2 catalysts is determined by the crystallinity of ZrO2 and the dopant (e.g., Ce, La, Ti or Y), and the promotion effect of Ti additives may be owing to the optimized ZrO2 crystal size and the accelerated hydrogen formation and desorption in the PDH reaction.
The tetrahedral Zn(ii) ions chemisorbed into the strained three-membered siloxane rings on the amorphous SiO2 surfaces can turn to the three-coordinate active center with Lewis acidity through losing one ZnO bond during the PDH reaction.218 The single-site Zn(ii) shows a high propylene selectivity, which benefits from a low energy barrier for the heterolytic CH activation through a non-redox mechanism and a high barrier for the undesired CC cleavage (Fig. 25). The alkyl-zinc and ZnO-type sites in Zn/SiO2 systems are prepared by one-cycle ALD synthesis using diethyl zinc precursor, and their difference in the PDH performance are investigated.219 The tricoordinate ethyl zinc-silica sites exhibit a higher activity in comparison with the tetracoordinate zinc oxide-type center, while the ethyl-zinc activation follows multiple pathways such as protonation or direct hydrogenolysis.

2.5. ZrOx-Based catalysts
ZrO2-based catalysts show catalytic activities for the CH activation and selective alkane dehydrogenation reactions (Table 6). The coordinatively unsaturated Zr cations (Zrcus) located on the top of an ideal flat surface are identified as the main active sites for the PDH reactions, and their concentration can be regulated by varying the kind of the supported hydrogenation-active metals such as Cu, Ru and Rh, and by doping with promoters such as Li, Ca, Mg, Cu, Sm, La and Y.220224 The intrinsic activity of Zrcus sites is reported to be related to their unsaturation degree, depending on the oxygen-removal amount from the catalyst. For instance, the highest degrees of removal of surface oxygen for bare YZrOx and LaZrOx are less than 0.1% under a reduction temperature of 650 C, whereas greatly higher values were found for the Ru-modified 0.05Ru/YZrOx and 0.05Ru/LaZrOx, which are 11.0% and 13.0%, respectively.221 Such oxygen removal is generally accomplished through two processes due to the high mobility of oxygen species. When a certain amount of surface oxygen vacancies is achieved, a part of the bulk lattice oxygen species diffuse to the surface for filling the vacancies until a balance between migration and reduction (Fig. 26a and b) is reached. The catalytic stability obtained on these modified ZrOx-based catalysts is comparable with that of a conventional K-CrOx/Al2O3 catalyst in 60 cycles of PDH reaction and regeneration in a temperature range from 550 to 625 C (Fig. 26c). The doping of Cu as a promoter and not as an active site into the ZrO2 matrix is also reported to improve the creation of more active Zrcus sites, and the optimal CuZrO-8 catalyst displays over 98% propylene selectivity and 0.47 mmolC3H8 g1 min1 initial reaction rate in the PDH reaction at 600 C.223 For the Rh/ZrO2 catalyst, both increased content of Zrcus sites by the Rh loading and improved hydrogen desorption ability achieved by Rh-relevant sites are responsible for its enhanced initial activity.224 Nonetheless, high Rh loading is unfavorable because it can disturb the desorption of propylene and hydrogen from Rh sites.

The synergistic effect between CrOx and ZrOx in bulk binary CrZrOx oxides has also been proved as an effective strategy to enhance the catalytic performance of Zrcus-based catalysts. These CrZrOx oxides are different from the CrOx catalysts on ZrOx-based supports that are discussed in Section 2.2.1 CrOx-based catalysts. For instance, the binary CrZrOx catalyst displays a superior stability than the supported CrOx/LaZrOx catalyst, suggesting that bulk promoting of ZrO2 with Cr is advantageous over simple deposition of CrOx on the LaZrOx surface.225 The XPS results of the Cr10Zr90Ox and Cr5Zr95Ox samples demonstrate an extremely low concentration of Cr on the surfaces, indicating that Cr species are nearly completely incorporated into the ZrO2 matrix forming a solid solution structure.226 The enrichment of Zr species on the catalyst surface contributes to enhancing the dehydrogenation activity and excluding the reaction route catalyzed by the conventional Cr-relevant sites. Two neighboring Zrcus sites in CrZrOx oxides are concluded to be catalytically active for the PDH reactions, and their distribution is determined by the interaction among Cr, Zr, and support, as well as by the ZrO2 crystal size.227 The Cr promotes improved reducibility of ZrO2 and content of the anion vacancies for CrZrOx oxides, thus increasing the intrinsic activity of Zrcus sites in comparison with that of the Cr-free ZrO2 catalyst. In addition, SiO2 serves as a more preferable support than Al2O3 or TiO2, because of its relatively lower interaction with CrOx species. For the SiO2-supported CrZrOx-based catalysts with the same Cr contents, their ZrO2 crystallinity can be carefully regulated by thermal treatment at different temperatures, and a higher crystallinity of ZrO2 can promote the concentration of the active sites, and nonetheless, the reaction rates for propylene formation and coking are both increased to the same extent.228 To further improve the anti-coking stability of CrZrOx catalysts in the PDH reactions, the modification with combined basic Cs and acidic P promoters is proved useful to inhibit the oligomerization of two neighboring propylenes by isolating the active sites.229
The optimally designed defective ZrO2 catalyst without the usage of any dopant or supported species shows industrially relevant activity and durability in the PDH reaction at 550 C, which is superior to those of commonly used Pt, CrOx, GaOx or VOx species.230 About 40 ZrO2 samples with different particle sizes and nanostructures have been evaluated in the PDH reactions, and their propylene formation rate decreases by a factor of up to 70 when the size increases from 7 to 45 nm. If the lattice oxygen species of ZrO2 are removed through reduction with H2 or CO, the reaction rate can be significantly increased (Fig. 27a and b), suggesting that the promoted PDH activity depends on the increased concentration of the active Zrcus sites. The catalytic role of the Zrcus sites is further investigated by DFT calculations of the PDH reaction over oxygen-defective d-ZrO2(11) and stoichiometric s-ZrO2(11) surfaces with monoclinic phase. Based on the Gibbs free energy profiles (Fig. 27ce), for the activation of methylene CH bond, a ZrO pair site of s-ZrO2(11) is found to be the most favorable center through a heterolytic route, whereas it is a homolytic step that occurred on two adjacent Zr cations of d-ZrO2(11) without involving lattice oxygen. A 1.09 eV lower CH activation barrier is obtained in the presence of the oxygen vacancy on the d-ZrO2 (11) facet relative to the s-ZrO2(11) facet. For the further step of a PDH reaction, the transformation of the Zr-iso-C3H7 and H-O intermediate for producing propylene and hydrogen, their apparent free energy barriers over the d-ZrO2 (11) facet are lower than those over the s-ZrO2(11) facet, thus indicating that these two key steps are affected by the Zrcus sites. According to combined experimental observations and theoretical calculation results, the Zrcus sites in the tetragonal ZrO2 phase are also catalytically active in the PDH reactions, and both the selectivity and the generation rate of propylene increase with a decrease in the crystallite size of the tetragonal ZrO2.231 The Zrcus sites in the monoclinic and tetragonal ZrO2 show similar intrinsic activities through homolytic breaking of propane CH bonds, and nevertheless the monoclinic ZrO2 displays a higher propylene selectivity relative to the tetragonal ZrO2 due to a higher ratio of the Zrcus sites to those coking sites.

2.6. Other catalysts
Several noble metals, non-noble transition metals and metal oxides are reported as the active, selective and stable PDH catalysts. The monometallic Rh catalyst supported on γ-Al2O3 favours the formation of methane as the primary product and larger amount of coke species, exhibiting a low conversion of 10.7% and a propylene selectivity of only 25.4% in the PDH reaction at 600 C.232 The Sn additive in the bimetallic Rh(0.5)Sn(3.0) catalyst plays a critical role in suppressing the coke deposition and cracking of strongly adsorbed intermediates, displaying an enhanced PDH performance of 30.8% conversion and 96.3% selectivity under identical conditions. The GaRh supported catalytically active liquid metal solutions (SCALMS) on Al2O3 are one kind of newly emerging catalysts.233,234 At a selected PDH reaction temperature of 550 C, the Ga/Rh ratios of 25 and 34 lead to the formation of a mixture of intermetallic GaRh compounds and a liquid Ga-rich GaRh alloy, while over 80 ratios induce the formation of pure liquid droplets of GaRh alloy. The entirely liquid alloy with a highly dynamic interface shows a significant enhancement in both catalytic activity and propylene selectivity, which may be due to the maximum distribution of the single Rh atoms at the liquid/gas interface. Based on the DFT calculation results, the propane CH activation and following hydride recombination are catalyzed by the SA Rh site, and the propyl intermediate transfers to the Ga surface to synergistically accomplish a PDH cycle. DFT calculation predictions indicate that two-dimensional Ru-phthalocyanine (Ru-Pc) may be a potential SA catalyst for the selective PDH reaction in view of the high CH activation ability of SA Ru and weak π-binding interaction between Ru and propylene.235 The SiO2-supported Ru2P and RuP nanoparticles are prepared using H3PO4 as the P precursor for the PDH reactions.236 Increased P levels reduce the energy of the Ru 4d orbitals that form Ru-adsorbate bonds for weakening the adsorption of propylene and hydrogen, and therefore enhances the propylene selectivity of the catalysts. The optimal RuP catalyst with a MnP-type structure exhibits 91% selectivity at 25% propane conversion.
The PDH reactions over PdCu SAA and cluster surfaces are revealed by the DFT calculation results with respect to the activation of CH bond, the desorption of propylene, and the formation of key intermediates.237239 The doping of SA Pd into the Cu(111) surface leads to a low energy barrier for the CH bond activation and the facile coupling and desorption of hydrogen. A great difference in the energies between propylene desorption and further transformation pathways benefits a high propylene selectivity. The IR and Raman spectra of the relevant reactive intermediates considering two potential pathways are further simulated for the PdCu SAAs-catalyzed PDH reaction. The catalytic PDH performances of SiO2-supported Pd and Pd3Fe nanoparticles with similar 2 nm sizes are compared at 510 C.240 The propylene selectivity is 45% and 94%, while the specific reaction rate is 0.04 and 0.2 s1 for the monometallic Pd and the bimetallic Pd3Fe catalysts, respectively. The enhanced property is contributed to the isolation effect of the inert Fe atoms on the active Pt atoms and to the decreased energy of the Pd 4d orbits for weakening the adsorbate bond energies.
The surface isolated [InH2]+ ions in CHA zeolite are prepared via a reductive solid-state ion-exchange methodology, acting as the active sites for the selective EDH reaction through concerted and alkyl mechanisms.241 The [InH2]+-contained In-CHA catalyst displays 27% conversion and 97% ethylene selectivity for a 90 h reaction at 660 C. The formation of the zeolite-coordinated protons and carbenium intermediate species is suppressed on the [InH2]+ sites, which is beneficial for enhanced ethylene selectivity and anti-coking stability.
The P-modified Mo/ZSM-5 catalysts are reported for the EDH reactions.242 The P species may interact with the framework Al to form SAPO-like interfaces for reducing the acidic properties and changing the channel texture of the zeolite. They also provide the specific interaction with Mo for prohibiting the reduction of Mo and improving the dispersion of Mo. The greatly increased ethylene selectivity and activity are achieved in the presence of 1 wt% of P additives in the Mo/ZSM-5 catalyst, while enhanced stability is obtained on the 2.5 wt% P-modified Mo/ZSM-5 catalyst.
The Ni(111)-catalyzed PDH and side reactions are theoretically studied with DFT calculations.243 Since different adsorption energies are observed, the adsorption of propane and propylene is physisorption and chemisorption, respectively. For the facile first CH activation, the formation of 1-propyl intermediate is both kinetically and thermodynamically more favorable than that of the 2-propyl intermediate. However, the strong adsorption of propylene results in the deep dehydrogenation for a low PDH selectivity. Unlike the Ni(111) site, the SiO2-supported tetrahedral Ni(ii) phosphosilicate SA site affords a propylene selectivity of 90% in the PDH reaction at 600 C.244 The NiOSi bond is responsible for the propane CH activation, while the NiOP bond prevents the reduction of Ni(ii) to Ni(0), and therefore this Ni-P/SiO2 catalyst shows a high catalytic PDH property. Electrochemical EDH processes using Ni-contained proton-conducting solid oxide electrolyzers (SOEs) have been developed recently, and 75% conversion and 100% ethylene selectivity can be achieved at 700 C and 0.8 V voltage using a NiCu-doped Nb-Ti-MnO anode.245,246
The defective TiO2 has been reported as a catalytically active catalyst for the PDH reaction, while the fourfold-coordinated Ti atoms surrounding oxygen vacancies are believed to be the main active sites.247,248 For the nanosized anatase TiO2, its oxygen vacancies and coordinatively unsaturated Ti cations (Ticus) can originate from a reaction between surface lattice oxygen and reductive propane and its derivatives. Through the synergistic effect of the Ostwald ripening and high-temperature reduction of nanosized TiO2, a moderate migration of mobile lattice oxygen atoms allows the equilibrium between formation and stability of vacancies and Ticus to be easily reached, whereas excessive reduction causes the catalyst deactivation. The in situ reduced TiO2-x nanoparticles exhibit an initial propane conversion of 67% and a one-pass yield of propylene at 45% in the PDH reaction at 600 C. For the defective anatase TiO2(101)-catalyzed PDH reaction, the catalytic roles of the Ticus cations are further investigated by the DFT calculations. The Ticus cations facilitate the breaking of the second CH bond of propane rather than the first CH bond with the aid of a stronger hydrogen chemisorption effect.
3. Mechanistic considerations
The corresponding catalytic mechanisms of EDH and PDH reactions over a variety of nobble metal and transition metal oxide catalysts have been compared in a review reported by Weckhuysen et al. in 2014.8 As represented by Horiuti and Polanyi in 1934, LangmuirHinshelwood kinetics is used to describe the mechanism of Pt-catalyzed DH reactions that follow dissociative adsorption of alkane, elimination of the second hydrogen atom and recombinative formation of hydrogen molecules, and desorption of olefin and hydrogen.249,250 According to most experimental and theoretical calculation results, either the first CH bond cleavage for the adsorbed propane or the second CH bond cleavage is identified as the rate-limiting step.8
3.1. CH activation and olefin desorption
The CH cleavage of propane may lead to the formation of 1-, or 2-propyl intermediate in the Pt(111)-catalyzed PDH reaction, whereas the 1-propyl intermediate may be observed in the PDH reaction over PtSn alloy with a down-shifted d-band center relative to pure Pt.251 After the cleavage of the second CH bond, the olefin intermediate adsorbs on the Pt catalysts with π- or di-σ-type binding depending on the catalyst surface property and coverage degree as well as the conditions (e.g., temperature, pressure, and composition of co-fed gases), according to the experimental observations of the propylene chemisorption on the Pt(111) surface under ultra-high vacuum (UHV) conditions using reflectionabsorption IR spectroscopy and TPD characterizations.252,253 The adsorption strength of olefin on the Pt sites is determined by the geometric and electronic properties of Pt. For instance, the DFT calculation results demonstrate that propylene prefers a di-σ configuration on Pt(111) with an adsorption energy of 0.51 eV, whereas the adsorption on the step edge of Pt(211) is a more exothermic process with an energy of 0.81 eV.254256 For the adsorption of propylene on the Sn-modified Pt3Sn(111) surface, a di-σh binding with an energy of 0.24 eV is favored over a di-σf binding, and a similar preference of di-σh over di-σf site is also observed in the ethylene adsorption on Pt3Sn(111), which is due to the decoration effect of Sn atoms on the Pt step sites.257
For the EDH reaction over a single Cr3+O site on SiO2, the CH activation produces CrC and OH bonds through σ-bond metathesis and then the β-H transfer occurs onto a Cr site.258 For most of the DH reactions catalyzed by the metal oxides with coordinatively unsaturated sites, the heterolytic CH cleavage route is energetically favorable to form a metalalkyl intermediate and OH species, which is in accordance with the observations in the cases of V3+, Co2+-, Feδ+-, and Zrcus-based systems. On the other hand, the abstraction of hydrogen from ethane or propane can also result in the formation of the alkoxide intermediate species (e.g., ethoxide and isopropoxide) on the metal oxide surface, for instance, on the Cr2O3Al2O3 composite.259
Summarizing the specific rate values (mol propane per mol metal per s) of the PDH reactions catalyzed by metals and metal oxides, the monometallic Pt and the bimetallic sites like PtSn typically show the highest rates of 101 s1, which are four or three orders of magnitude greater than the 105104 s1 rates obtained on the metal oxide-based active sites, exemplified by CrOx, GaOx, VOx, ZrOx, CoOx and ZnOx. For enhancing the intrinsic activity and selectivity of metal- and metal oxide-catalyzed EDH and PDH reactions, the catalyst design strategies are still required to optimize the promoter addition and to control the interface properties between the active metals/ions and the adjacent support sites.
Specifically, the strong acid sites on the catalyst surfaces may tightly bond with olefin intermediates, allowing their further transformation such as deep dehydrogenation or oligomerization for the formation of coke precursors, and therefore significantly influencing the DH selectivity and catalytic stability. It is necessary to properly modify the commonly used metal oxide-based supports (e.g., Al2O3) with reduced acidity or to employ the high-silica and pure-silica zeolites with the minimal acidity to localize metal sites, suppressing the acid site-determined side reactions.
3.2. Coke species and coking processes
Except for the structural change of active sites through metal sintering and metal oxide reduction, the accumulation of coke species blocking the pores or active sites significantly deactivate the DH catalysts. Coke, a group of hydrocarbons with various graphitization degrees and C/H ratios, is generally generated on the Brnsted acid sites or other active sites during the DH reactions through complex processes including cracking, deep dehydrogenation, polymerization and addition of alkanes, olefins and radicals. For instance, by combining HRTEM, FT-IR, Raman, TGA, and pyrolysis GC-MS characterizations, aliphatics, aromatics, and pre-graphite coke are identified to be deposited on the metal, in the vicinity of the metal, and on the support of the PtSn/Al2O3-based PDH catalyst, and their amounts are 69.0, 4.4, and 26.6 wt %, respectively, and furthermore the in situ DRIFT spectral results also reveal the transformation process from the aliphatic coke into the aromatics through deep dehydrogenation.260 In consideration of both monolayer and multilayer coke formation as well as exponential deactivation rate, a kinetic model has been proposed to describe the coking step in the PDH over a PtSn/hierarchical SAPO-34 zeolite catalyst.261 The dimerization of adsorbed propylene intermediates on the PtSn/Al2O3 catalyst is regarded as the kinetically relevant step for the coke formation on the metal sites, causing a larger hydrogen/carbon ratio of these coke species on the metals in comparison with that on the support.262 Depending on the coking rates, the Pt-catalyzed PDH reaction typically includes two distinct stages, initially a quick deactivation and then a following steady state. According to the DFT-based kinetic Monte Carlo simulation results, two kinds of geometries of the active surface Pt sites for dehydrogenation and deep reactions exist: one is the sites that are mainly occupied by strongly adsorbed C2/C1 species causing the quick deactivation, and another is the unoccupied sites survived in the initial stage, which can steadily catalyze the PDH reaction to propylene.263 An additional transport process is observed to be involved between the formation of coke precursors on Pt sites and their subsequent assimilation into the growing graphene sheets during the Pt/MgAlOx-catalyzed PDH reaction.264 A hypothesis called drain-off effect has been proposed to explain the removal and migration processes of the mobile coke precursors from the vicinity of active Pt sites to the support where they finally deposit as coke for keeping the active sites clean.265,266 For the activity-coke content relationship over the Cr2O3/Al2O3 catalyst, a monolayer-multilayer coke growth model has been proposed to quantitatively describe it.267 This kind of model can also quite accurately describe the coking processes of VOx/Al2O3SiO2 catalysts during the PDH reactions based on the kinetic analysis results of TGA profiles.268 The rate constant of coke formation is found to increase with the polymerization degree of VOx species rather than the acidity of the catalyst.
To achieve the effective control of coke deposition for extending the catalyst lifetime, some strategies have been reported. The combination of the electronic and drain-off effects highlights the superiority of the anti-coking ability of bimetallic catalysts (e.g., PtSn, PtGa and PtCu) than that of monometallic Pt catalysts because the electron-rich Pt atoms can dramatically weaken the interaction of Pt with coke precursors and facilitate their desorption and migration.39,68,269 The elimination of the acid sites from the selected support and the poisoning of the coking-relevant active sites as well as the improvement of the mass transport through optimizing the porous structure can effectively suppress the coke formation on the DH catalysts.270 For instance, introducing the hierarchical pores into the ZSM-5 zeolite can decrease the acid content of the PtSnNa/ZSM-5 catalyst, greatly improving the capacity for coke accommodation and modifying the migration process of coke from the active metal sites to the supports.271 The isolation of the active coking sites has also been proved to be a suitable strategy to prevent the polymerization of the coke precursors. Furthermore, regulating the DH reaction atmosphere with co-feeding of water vapor, hydrogen, or soft oxidant CO2 can reduce the generation of coke species to a certain extent.272
To meet the requirements for continuous production, a regeneration of the coked DH catalyst under an oxidative atmosphere is a critical process for determining the recycling stability of the catalyst. The operation parameters of the regeneration are apparently related to the amount and the type of the deposited coke species on the spent catalyst. However, the oxidative conditions may result in the structural change of the metals or ions as the active sites in the catalyst, and thus this requires the stabilization effect that the promoter or the support provides. It has been reported that hydrogen regeneration is an effective approach for maintaining the performance, especially the stability of PtSn/γ-Al2O3-based PDH catalysts in comparison with the regeneration processes under nitrogen and oxygen.273 Treatment using nitrogen can only eliminate those low-density coke species, while burning in oxygen causes phase separation and particle agglomeration of PtSn bimetals during repeated redox processes. A relatively marginal impact is observed on the hydrogen-regenerated catalyst with respect to the active metal structure and size. In addition to the removal of the low-density coke, a higher mobility of the residual coke can also be achieved through hydrogenation reactions, consequently freeing the active metal sites to launch the catalytic DH reaction.
3.3. Catalytic role of co-feeding of hydrogen
The co-feeding of hydrogen is widely adopted in the catalytic EDH and PDH reactions in view of the multiple positive roles of hydrogen. In the case of the PtSn/Al2O3-catalyzed PDH reactions, the presence of hydrogen increases the propylene formation rate and decreases both the formation rate and the graphitization degree of coke species.272 The acceleration effect of hydrogen on the EDH and PDH activities are observed on the Pt/Mg(Ga)(Al)O catalysts, and a volcano-shape relationship between the DH reaction rates and H2/alkane ratios along with little impact on the olefin selectivity is obtained.231 The assistance of a moderate amount of hydrogen species improves the dehydrogenation of alkyl species formed upon dissociative adsorption of alkane, and however, the excess hydrogen species contribute to the deep hydrogenation of olefin intermediates. The co-feeding of hydrogen in the Cr/BaZrO3-catalyzed EDH reaction can suppress the formation of coke, but leads to a reduced reaction rate of ethylene formation.274 It has also been reported that the ethylene selectivity decreases dramatically with increasing H2/C2H6 ratio for the monometallic Pt/Mg(Al)O but only slightly for the bimetallic PtSn/Mg(Al)O, while a more significant inhibition effect on the coke formation by hydrogen additives is obtained on PtSn/Mg(Al)O rather than Pt/Mg(Al)O.275 A certain interaction between hydrogen species and Pt metal sites exists in the co-fed hydrogen-DH reactions, suggesting that, not only the single adsorption competition effect among co-fed gases, both the catalyst structure sensitivity and the synergistic effect of metals/ions and hydrogen species should be considered for explaining the relevant reaction steps of hydrogenation, dehydrogenation, and oligomerization.
The mechanism of the positive roles of co-feeding of hydrogen is explored with DFT calculations on the Pt(111)-catalyzed PDH process.276 A decreased coverage of deeply dehydrogenated coke precursors such as ethylidyne and methylidyne species is observed on the Pt(111) surface with increasing hydrogen pressure. Furthermore, increasing hydrogen coverage decreases the adsorption strength of propylene intermediates and increases the energy barriers for their further dehydrogenation pathways for preventing the side reactions (Fig. 28). The contributions from these three aspects explains the higher catalytic PDH activity of the Pt catalysts in the presence of hydrogen. The kinetic Monte Carlo simulations of the PDH reaction on Pt(111) also demonstrate a dual role of accelerating propylene formation rate and reducing the consumption of the formed propylene.263 The inhibited coke formation is also demonstrated in a case of the co-feeding of hydrogen during the DH reaction over a Pt4 model.277 The Pt4H phase is identified to be stable under the typical reaction conditions, which can improve the olefin selectivity by shifting the third CH cleavage step to higher energy for hardly competing with the preferred olefin desorption.

4. Conclusions and perspectives
The installations of industrial PDH projects have been built in recent years with utilization of either Catofin CrOx/Al2O3 or Oleflex PtSn/Al2O3 catalysts, and nonetheless, further improvements are still required with respect to the catalytic efficiencies and the single-pass and recycling stability.
Advanced synthesis strategies, including but not limited to ALD and SOMC approaches, are necessary to finely control the structure of Pt- or oxide-based active sites in the DH catalysts. By localizing, using proper supports such as oxides and zeolites through the SMSI effect and confinement effect, the subnanometric or SA/SAA Pt-related metal sites exhibit unique catalytic performances in comparison with the larger metal ensembles. Both geometric and electronic modification effects by the promoter species can also be well regulated using favorable synthesis methods. Benefiting from the utilization of the high-resolution characterization techniques, e.g., in situ XAS and HAADF-STEM, the effective structural information of the catalysts can be observed allowing us to establish the real relationships between the adsorption and catalytic properties. It is worth making further efforts to construct stable structures for the small-sized metallic or ionic active sites for maximizing the catalytic efficiency in selective alkane DH reactions.
Selective activation of alkane CH bonds and prohibition of the CC cleavage and other side reactions are critical to achieve both high olefin selectivity and great long-term stability. The localization of metallic atoms or ions on the metal oxide matrix or the zeolite framework may induce the formation of new active sites to be involved in a synergetic reaction mechanism or an undesired pathway. Their catalytic contribution is significant for the non-Pt DH catalysts than for the Pt-based catalysts, since the reaction determined by these active sites may show a similar specific reaction rate with desired selective DH reaction. For instance, the incorporation of metal hetero-ions into the zeolite framework produces the acid sites in single configuration or even in LewisBrnsted acid pairs. In the former case, the excess Brnsted acid sites may catalyze the deep dehydrogenation of the formed olefin as the intermediate, whereas the LewisBrnsted acid pairs in the Ga/H-MFI catalyst show significantly higher activity than the isolated Ga+ sites toward CH activation and hydrogen elimination in the PDH reaction. Therefore, the complete functions of surface acid sites should be profoundly realized, not limited to the negative roles of serving as the active sites for CC cracking, deep dehydrogenation, or coking process.
Furthermore, the understanding on the catalyst structureactivity relationship and mechanism for the alkane ODH processes may provide a reference for the structural design of the DH catalysts, though different tasks and limitations exist between these two processes.35,7 For instance, novel BN-based or B-related materials offer promising alternatives to the commonly studied metal oxides such as VOx and CrOx, and they catalyze the key steps of selective alkane ODH reaction, such as CH activation and olefin desorption, in particular pathways.278285 As one of the efficient ODH processes, the chemical looping (CL-ODH) route includes two cyclic separate steps, alkane dehydrogenation to form olefin by the lattice oxygen species of metal oxide-based oxygen carrier and reoxidation by the oxidative gas.286,287 For the CL-ODH reaction of ethane to ethylene at 850 C, the NaW-promoted Mg6MnO8 redox catalyst displays 89.2% selectivity and 68.2% yield.288,289 For the CL-ODH reaction of propane to propylene at 500 C, the MoVO mixed oxides exhibit 89% selectivity at 36% propane conversion over 100 cycles.290 Therefore, the catalytic roles of the oxygen species that exist in the gas phase and lattice phase, and on the interface are still the fundamental catalysis topics for the selective activation of CH and CC bonds in the light hydrocarbons.291293
The irreversible coke deposition for deactivation is the most important issue that all DH catalysts suffer from. Several strategies have been performed to solve this problem. The electronic properties of metallic Pt and other active metals or metal oxides can be finely modified by the promoters or supports; for instance, the Sn-shifted d-band center of the Pt atom and the N-doped carbon matrix-tuned 3d orbit energy of the single-atom V site consequently reduce the interaction between catalysts and olefin intermediates for the easy desorption of olefin products. The geometric modification on the active sites through isolation effects is also useful to prevent the strong adsorption of coke precursors or their polymerization, and thus to reduce the formation of coke species. For the selected support, the elimination of the possible active sites responsible for coking is necessary. The alkaline additives are widely used for the oxide-based supports, while the high-silica or pure-silica zeolites are also adopted as the supports, in view of their lower surface acidity. The reaction atmosphere is another factor affecting the formation of coke species, and the co-feeding of steam vapor and hydrogen is a reported method able to reduce the coke amount. It is noted that these gaseous additives not only compete with the hydrocarbons in the adsorption, but also participate in the DH reactions. However, there are rare reports to systematically discuss the catalytic roles of these co-fed gases in the alkane DH reactions over non-Pt catalysts. To further increase the single-pass yield of the alkane DH reactions, the removal of hydrogen from the mixture of products can shift the equilibrium to the production of olefins by using Pd- or zeolite-based membrane reactors.294298 Nevertheless, the effect of hydrogen as a coke inhibitor is weakened, and thus the coking issue and catalyst stability remain a challenge.
Another crucial issue related to the stability for metal or metal oxide-catalyzed alkane DH processes is the dynamic structural stability of the metallic or ionic active sites during the reaction and regeneration treatment. Although the SMSI effects can effectively stabilize the active sites against the high reaction temperature and reductive atmosphere in the DH reactions, overly strong interactions cause the active metals to be embedded into subsurface, lattice layers or the framework, and therefore reduces the accessibility or even the intrinsic activity of the active sites. It also results in the appearance of a relatively longer induction period in the initial reaction stage for completing the pre-activation of these active sites. This process is not ideal because of its low efficiency of raw gases and energy, while it also increases the difficulty for us to acquire the real structureactivity relationship and to propose a convincing mechanism. For these reasons, a moderate interaction among metals, promoters, and supports will be pivotal for the design of the DH catalysts, and an efficient pretreatment procedure needs to be developed.
For both the catalyst materials and reaction routes, there still exists much room to improve our understanding. Though some metal or metal oxide catalysts have achieved industrial applications, a full picture about the working state and the catalytic mechanism for these catalysts still cannot be realized. Further exploration of the structureproperty relationship will lead to the creation of efficient, selective and stable alkane DH catalysts through combining precise catalyst syntheses, high time-space resolution characterization, and rational theoretical calculations.
