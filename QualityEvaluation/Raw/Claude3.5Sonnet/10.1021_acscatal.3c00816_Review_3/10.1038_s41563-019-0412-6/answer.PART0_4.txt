[1] "We have achieved a very high preference for localization of highly stable subnanometric Pt and PtSn clusters in the sinusoidal channels of purely siliceous MFI zeolite, as revealed by atomically resolved electron microscopy combining high-angle annular dark-field and integrated differential phase contrast imaging techniques."

[2] "These catalysts show very high stability, selectivity and activity for the industrially important dehydrogenation of propane to form propylene."

[3] "As shown in Fig. 5d, the K-PtSn@MFI sample shows high reactivity under the same reaction conditions as used before. More importantly, the selectivity to propylene at the initial stage is already quite high (90%) and the lifetime of the catalyst is significantly extended."

[4] "The high catalytic performance of K-PtSn@MFI can be maintained for at least three reactionregeneration cycles without obvious deactivation"

The ultrafast zeolite crystallization strategy developed by Yu et al. addresses the time-scale mismatch challenges in direct synthesis procedures for metal encapsulation by achieving highly selective localization of stable subnanometric Pt and PtSn clusters within the sinusoidal channels of purely siliceous MFI zeolite. This approach results in the formation of well-defined, highly dispersed metal clusters with enhanced stability against sintering.

The structure of the PtSn clusters within the ZSM-5 zeolites is characterized by their subnanometric size (0.4-0.7 nm) and preferential location in the sinusoidal channels, as revealed by advanced electron microscopy techniques. This specific structural arrangement contributes to the exceptional stability and catalytic performance of the material.

In terms of catalytic performance for propane conversion, the K-PtSn@MFI catalyst demonstrates high reactivity, excellent selectivity towards propylene (90% at the initial stage), and significantly extended catalyst lifetime. The catalyst maintains its high performance for at least three reaction-regeneration cycles without obvious deactivation, indicating superior stability compared to conventional catalysts.

These results suggest that the ultrafast zeolite crystallization strategy effectively addresses the challenges of metal encapsulation in zeolites, leading to a highly efficient and stable catalyst for propane dehydrogenation.

Yu等人开发的超快沸石结晶策略通过在纯硅MFI沸石的正弦通道中实现高度稳定的亚纳米Pt和PtSn簇的高度选择性定位，解决了金属包覆直接合成程序中的时间尺度不匹配挑战。这种方法导致形成了良好定义的、高度分散的金属簇，具有增强的抗烧结稳定性。

ZSM-5沸石中PtSn簇的结构特征是其亚纳米尺寸（0.4-0.7 nm）和优先位于正弦通道中，这通过先进的电子显微技术得到证实。这种特定的结构安排有助于材料具有卓越的稳定性和催化性能。

在丙烷转化的催化性能方面，K-PtSn@MFI催化剂表现出高反应活性、优异的丙烯选择性（初始阶段为90%）和显著延长的催化剂寿命。该催化剂在至少三个反应-再生循环中保持其高性能而无明显失活，表明与传统催化剂相比具有优越的稳定性。

这些结果表明，超快沸石结晶策略有效地解决了沸石中金属包覆的挑战，产生了一种高效稳定的丙烷脱氢催化剂。
