[1] "Yu et al. confined the ultra-small Pt-Zn clusters into the pure silica zeolite by one-pot hydrothermal method and the catalyst revealed an excellent performance in PDH. The clusters still maintained a small size and no obvious agglomeration was discovered even under harsh industrial oxidationreduction conditions over 600 ℃"

[2] "However, the high crystallization temperature and high pH usually contributes to the precipitation of metal species during the crystallization process, which are not beneficial for metal species to diffuse into the channels of zeolites. The methods have certain limitations and are not suitable for Fe3+, In3+, etc."

The ultrafast zeolite crystallization strategy developed by Yu et al. addresses the time-scale mismatch challenges by using a one-pot hydrothermal method to confine ultra-small Pt-Zn clusters within pure silica zeolite. This approach results in excellent catalytic performance for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) and maintains small cluster sizes without obvious agglomeration, even under harsh industrial oxidation-reduction conditions above 600°C.

However, the literature also points out limitations of this method. The high crystallization temperature and high pH used in the process can lead to precipitation of metal species during crystallization, which hinders their diffusion into zeolite channels. Additionally, this approach is not suitable for certain metal ions like Fe3+ and In3+.

While the document does not specifically discuss PtSn clusters in ZSM-5 zeolites, it suggests that the ultrafast crystallization strategy can effectively form and stabilize small metal clusters within zeolite structures, leading to improved catalytic performance and stability for propane conversion reactions like PDH.

Yu等人开发的超快速沸石晶化策略通过使用一步水热法将超小的Pt-Zn簇限制在纯硅沸石中来解决时间尺度不匹配的挑战。这种方法在丙烷脱氢(PDH)反应中表现出优异的催化性能，并且即使在600°C以上的苛刻工业氧化还原条件下，也能保持簇的小尺寸而没有明显的聚集。

然而，文献也指出了这种方法的局限性。高结晶温度和高pH值会导致结晶过程中金属物种的沉淀，这阻碍了它们向沸石通道的扩散。此外，这种方法不适用于某些金属离子，如Fe3+和In3+。

虽然文档没有具体讨论ZSM-5沸石中的PtSn簇，但它表明超快速结晶策略可以有效地在沸石结构中形成和稳定小金属簇，从而提高丙烷转化反应（如PDH）的催化性能和稳定性。
