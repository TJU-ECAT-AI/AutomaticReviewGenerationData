[1] "Yu et al. confined the ultra-small Pt-Zn clusters into the pure silica zeolite by one-pot hydrothermal method and the catalyst revealed an excellent performance in PDH. The clusters still maintained a small size and no obvious agglomeration was discovered even under harsh industrial oxidationreduction conditions over 600"

[2] "However, the high crystallization temperature and high pH usually contributes to the precipitation of metal species during the crystallization process, which are not beneficial for metal species to diffuse into the channels of zeolites. The methods have certain limitations and are not suitable for Fe3+, In3+, etc."

The ultrafast zeolite crystallization strategy developed by Yu et al. addressed the time-scale mismatch challenges in direct synthesis procedures for metal encapsulation by using a one-pot hydrothermal method to confine ultra-small Pt-Zn clusters into pure silica zeolite. This method resulted in excellent performance for propane dehydrogenation (PDH), with the clusters maintaining a small size and showing no obvious agglomeration even under harsh industrial oxidation-reduction conditions over 600°C.

However, the document also points out limitations of this approach. The high crystallization temperature and high pH typically used in such methods can lead to precipitation of metal species during crystallization, hindering their diffusion into zeolite channels. Additionally, this method has certain limitations and is not suitable for some metal ions like Fe3+ and In3+.

The document does not provide specific information about the effects of this strategy on PtSn clusters within ZSM-5 zeolites or their catalytic performance in propane conversion. The information provided is primarily about Pt-Zn clusters in pure silica zeolite and mentions limitations for certain metal ions, but does not discuss PtSn clusters or ZSM-5 zeolites specifically in this context.

Yu等人开发的超快沸石结晶策略通过使用一步水热法将超小的Pt-Zn簇限制在纯硅沸石中，解决了金属包覆直接合成程序中的时间尺度不匹配挑战。这种方法在丙烷脱氢(PDH)中表现出色，即使在600°C以上的苛刻工业氧化还原条件下，簇仍保持小尺寸且没有明显的团聚。

然而，文献也指出了这种方法的局限性。通常使用的高结晶温度和高pH值可能导致结晶过程中金属物种沉淀，阻碍其向沸石通道扩散。此外，这种方法有一定的局限性，不适用于某些金属离子，如Fe3+和In3+。

文献没有提供关于这种策略对ZSM-5沸石中PtSn簇的形成、结构和催化性能，特别是在丙烷转化方面的具体信息。提供的信息主要是关于纯硅沸石中的Pt-Zn簇，并提到了某些金属离子的局限性，但没有具体讨论在这种情况下的PtSn簇或ZSM-5沸石。
