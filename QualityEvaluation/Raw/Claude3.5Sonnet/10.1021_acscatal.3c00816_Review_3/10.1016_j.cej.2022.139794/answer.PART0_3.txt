[1] "Yu et al. confined the ultra-small Pt-Zn clusters into the pure silica zeolite by one-pot hydrothermal method and the catalyst revealed an excellent performance in PDH. The clusters still maintained a small size and no obvious agglomeration was discovered even under harsh industrial oxidationreduction conditions over 600°C"

[2] "However, the high crystallization temperature and high pH usually contributes to the precipitation of metal species during the crystallization process, which are not beneficial for metal species to diffuse into the channels of zeolites. The methods have certain limitations and are not suitable for Fe3+, In3+, etc."

The ultrafast zeolite crystallization strategy developed by Yu et al. addressed the time-scale mismatch challenges in direct synthesis procedures for metal encapsulation by using a one-pot hydrothermal method to confine ultra-small Pt-Zn clusters into pure silica zeolite. This approach resulted in excellent performance for propane dehydrogenation (PDH).

The strategy led to the formation of small-sized clusters that maintained their size and showed no obvious agglomeration even under harsh industrial oxidation-reduction conditions over 600°C. This indicates improved stability and resistance to sintering of the encapsulated metal clusters.

However, the document also points out limitations of this method. The high crystallization temperature and high pH used in the process can cause precipitation of metal species during crystallization, hindering their diffusion into zeolite channels. Additionally, this approach is not suitable for certain metal ions like Fe3+ and In3+.

While the document doesn't specifically mention PtSn clusters in ZSM-5 zeolites, it suggests that the ultrafast crystallization strategy can generally improve the formation and stability of metal clusters within zeolite structures, potentially enhancing their catalytic performance for reactions like propane conversion.

Yu等人开发的超快分子筛结晶策略通过使用一步水热法将超小的Pt-Zn簇限制在纯硅分子筛中，解决了金属包覆直接合成程序中的时间尺度不匹配挑战。这种方法在丙烷脱氢(PDH)反应中表现出色。

该策略形成的小尺寸簇即使在600°C以上的苛刻工业氧化还原条件下也能保持其尺寸，并且没有明显的团聚现象。这表明包覆的金属簇具有更好的稳定性和抗烧结性。

然而，文献也指出了这种方法的局限性。高结晶温度和高pH值会导致结晶过程中金属物种沉淀，阻碍它们扩散到分子筛通道中。此外，这种方法不适用于某些金属离子，如Fe3+和In3+。

虽然文献没有具体提到ZSM-5分子筛中的PtSn簇，但它表明超快结晶策略通常可以改善分子筛结构中金属簇的形成和稳定性，可能会增强它们在丙烷转化等反应中的催化性能。
