          [1] "Yu et al. confined the ultra-small Pt-Zn clusters into the pure silica zeolite by one-pot hydrothermal method and the catalyst revealed an excellent performance in PDH. The clusters still maintained a small size and no obvious agglomeration was discovered even under harsh industrial oxidationreduction conditions over 600℃"

[2] "However, the high crystallization temperature and high pH usually contributes to the precipitation of metal species during the crystallization process, which are not beneficial for metal species to diffuse into the channels of zeolites. The methods have certain limitations and are not suitable for Fe3+, In3+, etc."

          The ultrafast zeolite crystallization strategy developed by Yu et al. addresses the time-scale mismatch challenges in direct synthesis procedures for metal encapsulation by using a one-pot hydrothermal method to confine ultra-small Pt-Zn clusters into pure silica zeolite. This approach results in excellent performance for propane dehydrogenation (PDH), with the clusters maintaining a small size and showing no obvious agglomeration even under harsh industrial oxidation-reduction conditions over 600°C.

However, the strategy has limitations. The high crystallization temperature and high pH typically used in such processes can lead to precipitation of metal species during crystallization, hindering their diffusion into zeolite channels. Additionally, this approach is not suitable for certain metal ions like Fe3+ and In3+.

While the document does not specifically discuss PtSn clusters within ZSM-5 zeolites or their catalytic performance in propane conversion, it suggests that the ultrafast crystallization strategy can effectively form and stabilize small metal clusters within zeolite structures, potentially leading to improved catalytic performance and stability for propane conversion reactions like PDH. However, the method may need to be adapted or modified for different metal combinations and zeolite types.

          Yu等人开发的超快速沸石结晶策略通过使用一步水热法将超小的Pt-Zn簇限制在纯硅沸石中，解决了金属包覆直接合成程序中的时间尺度不匹配挑战。这种方法在丙烷脱氢(PDH)中表现出色，即使在600°C以上的苛刻工业氧化还原条件下，簇仍保持小尺寸，没有明显的团聚现象。

然而，这种策略也有局限性。通常使用的高结晶温度和高pH值可能导致结晶过程中金属物种沉淀，阻碍它们扩散到沸石通道中。此外，这种方法不适用于某些金属离子，如Fe3+和In3+。

虽然文献没有具体讨论ZSM-5沸石中的PtSn簇或它们在丙烷转化中的催化性能，但它表明超快速结晶策略可以有效地在沸石结构中形成和稳定小金属簇，可能会提高丙烷转化反应（如PDH）的催化性能和稳定性。然而，这种方法可能需要针对不同的金属组合和沸石类型进行调整或修改。
