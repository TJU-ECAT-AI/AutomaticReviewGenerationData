[1] "Yu et al. confined the ultra-small Pt-Zn clusters into the pure silica zeolite by one-pot hydrothermal method and the catalyst revealed an excellent performance in PDH. The clusters still maintained a small size and no obvious agglomeration was discovered even under harsh industrial oxidationreduction conditions over 600 "

[2] "However, the high crystallization temperature and high pH usually contributes to the precipitation of metal species during the crystallization process, which are not beneficial for metal species to diffuse into the channels of zeolites."

The ultrafast zeolite crystallization strategy developed by Yu et al. addresses the time-scale mismatch challenges in direct synthesis procedures for metal encapsulation by using a one-pot hydrothermal method to confine ultra-small Pt-Zn clusters within pure silica zeolite. This approach results in the formation of small, stable clusters that resist agglomeration even under harsh industrial oxidation-reduction conditions above 600°C. 

However, the document does not provide specific information about the effects of this strategy on PtSn clusters within ZSM-5 zeolites or their catalytic performance in propane conversion. The text mentions challenges with high crystallization temperatures and high pH contributing to metal species precipitation during crystallization, which can hinder diffusion into zeolite channels, but does not directly link this to Yu et al.'s strategy or PtSn clusters in ZSM-5.

Yu等人开发的超快速沸石结晶策略通过使用一步水热法将超小的Pt-Zn簇限制在纯硅沸石中，解决了金属包覆直接合成程序中的时间尺度不匹配挑战。这种方法形成了小而稳定的簇，即使在600°C以上的严苛工业氧化还原条件下也能抵抗团聚。

然而，该文献并未提供关于这种策略对ZSM-5沸石中PtSn簇的形成、结构以及在丙烷转化中的催化性能的具体信息。文中提到高结晶温度和高pH值会导致结晶过程中金属物种沉淀，这可能会阻碍金属物种向沸石通道的扩散，但并未直接将此与Yu等人的策略或ZSM-5中的PtSn簇联系起来。
