[1] "Yu et al. (22) developed an ultrafast zeolite crystallization strategy based on the combination of precursor age, seed additives, and fast-heating tubular reactor (Figure 5b). The XRD spectra reveal that complete crystallization (i.e., relative crystallinity of 100%) of ZSM-5 zeolites could be achieved within a 5 min reaction at 170 C."

[2] "Benefiting from the ultrafast crystallization rate, the PtSn clusters can be fully encapsulated within ZSM-5 zeolites."

[3] "When fixing the Pt loading at 0.32 wt % and increasing Sn loadings from 0 to 1.2 wt %, the size of PtSn clusters decreases from 4 nm to 1 nm. The optimized PtSn-ZSM-5 catalyst exhibits initial propane conversion of 65%, which is much higher than that of impregnated Pt/Sn-ZSM-5."

The ultrafast zeolite crystallization strategy developed by Yu et al. addresses the time-scale mismatch challenges in direct synthesis procedures for metal encapsulation by significantly reducing the crystallization time of ZSM-5 zeolites. This strategy combines precursor age, seed additives, and a fast-heating tubular reactor to achieve complete crystallization of ZSM-5 zeolites within 5 minutes at 170°C.

The rapid crystallization rate enables full encapsulation of PtSn clusters within the ZSM-5 zeolites. This method allows for better control over the size and distribution of PtSn clusters. By fixing the Pt loading and increasing Sn loadings, the size of PtSn clusters can be reduced from 4 nm to 1 nm.

The resulting PtSn-ZSM-5 catalyst shows improved catalytic performance compared to impregnated Pt/Sn-ZSM-5. The optimized catalyst exhibits an initial propane conversion of 65%, which is significantly higher than that of the impregnated counterpart. This improvement in catalytic activity can be attributed to the better dispersion and encapsulation of PtSn clusters within the zeolite structure, which is made possible by the ultrafast crystallization strategy.

Yu等人开发的超快沸石结晶策略通过显著缩短ZSM-5沸石的结晶时间，解决了直接合成程序中金属包覆的时间尺度不匹配问题。这种策略结合了前驱体老化、种子添加剂和快速加热管式反应器，在170°C下5分钟内就能实现ZSM-5沸石的完全结晶。

快速的结晶速率使PtSn簇能够完全包覆在ZSM-5沸石中。这种方法可以更好地控制PtSn簇的大小和分布。通过固定Pt负载量并增加Sn负载量，PtSn簇的尺寸可以从4 nm减小到1 nm。

由此得到的PtSn-ZSM-5催化剂比浸渍法制备的Pt/Sn-ZSM-5表现出更好的催化性能。优化后的催化剂初始丙烷转化率达到65%，显著高于浸渍法制备的对照样品。这种催化活性的提高可归因于PtSn簇在沸石结构中更好的分散和包覆，而这正是超快结晶策略所实现的。
