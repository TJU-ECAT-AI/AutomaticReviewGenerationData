[1] "Yu et al. (22) developed an ultrafast zeolite crystallization strategy based on the combination of precursor age, seed additives, and fast-heating tubular reactor (Figure 5b)."

[2] "The XRD spectra reveal that complete crystallization (i.e., relative crystallinity of 100%) of ZSM-5 zeolites could be achieved within a 5 min reaction at 170 C. Further increasing the reaction temperature to 190 C can reduce the crystallization time to 2 min."

[3] "Benefiting from the ultrafast crystallization rate, the PtSn clusters can be fully encapsulated within ZSM-5 zeolites."

[4] "When fixing the Pt loading at 0.32 wt % and increasing Sn loadings from 0 to 1.2 wt %, the size of PtSn clusters decreases from 4 nm to 1 nm."

[5] "The optimized PtSn-ZSM-5 catalyst exhibits initial propane conversion of 65%, which is much higher than that of impregnated Pt/Sn-ZSM-5."

The ultrafast zeolite crystallization strategy developed by Yu et al. addresses the time-scale mismatch challenges in direct synthesis procedures for metal encapsulation by significantly reducing the crystallization time of ZSM-5 zeolites. This strategy combines precursor age, seed additives, and a fast-heating tubular reactor to achieve complete crystallization of ZSM-5 zeolites within 5 minutes at 170°C, or even 2 minutes at 190°C.

This ultrafast crystallization rate allows for the full encapsulation of PtSn clusters within the ZSM-5 zeolites. The rapid formation of the zeolite structure around the metal clusters prevents their aggregation and ensures their uniform distribution within the zeolite matrix.

The strategy also affects the structure of the encapsulated PtSn clusters. By fixing the Pt loading at 0.32 wt% and increasing Sn loadings from 0 to 1.2 wt%, the size of PtSn clusters can be controlled and decreased from 4 nm to 1 nm. This ability to fine-tune the cluster size allows for optimizing the metal dispersion and surface area, which are crucial factors in catalytic performance.

In terms of catalytic performance, the optimized PtSn-ZSM-5 catalyst produced by this method exhibits superior activity compared to traditionally prepared catalysts. It achieves an initial propane conversion of 65%, which is significantly higher than that of impregnated Pt/Sn-ZSM-5. This improved performance can be attributed to the better dispersion and encapsulation of the PtSn clusters within the zeolite structure, which is made possible by the ultrafast crystallization strategy.

Yu等人开发的超快速沸石结晶策略通过显著缩短ZSM-5沸石的结晶时间，解决了直接合成程序中金属包覆的时间尺度不匹配挑战。这种策略结合了前驱体老化、种子添加剂和快速加热管式反应器，能在170°C下5分钟内，或在190°C下2分钟内完成ZSM-5沸石的完全结晶。

这种超快速结晶速率使PtSn簇能够完全包覆在ZSM-5沸石中。沸石结构在金属簇周围的快速形成防止了它们的聚集，确保了它们在沸石基质中的均匀分布。

该策略还影响了包覆的PtSn簇的结构。通过将Pt负载固定在0.32 wt%，并将Sn负载从0增加到1.2 wt%，可以控制PtSn簇的尺寸并使其从4 nm减小到1 nm。这种能够精细调节簇大小的能力允许优化金属分散度和表面积，这些是催化性能的关键因素。

在催化性能方面，通过这种方法生产的优化PtSn-ZSM-5催化剂表现出优于传统制备催化剂的活性。它实现了65%的初始丙烷转化率，显著高于浸渍法制备的Pt/Sn-ZSM-5。这种性能的改善可归因于PtSn簇在沸石结构中更好的分散和包覆，这是由超快速结晶策略实现的。
