[1] "Yu et al. (22) developed an ultrafast zeolite crystallization strategy based on the combination of precursor age, seed additives, and fast-heating tubular reactor (Figure 5b). The XRD spectra reveal that complete crystallization (i.e., relative crystallinity of 100%) of ZSM-5 zeolites could be achieved within a 5 min reaction at 170 C. Further increasing the reaction temperature to 190 C can reduce the crystallization time to 2 min."

[2] "Benefiting from the ultrafast crystallization rate, the PtSn clusters can be fully encapsulated within ZSM-5 zeolites. Inductively coupled plasma (ICP) data show that the Pt loadings in silica matrix increase with increasing zeolite crystallinity, which evidence the formation of Pt nanoclusters and show that the crystallization of ZSM-5 proceeds in the same ultrafast pace."

[3] "When fixing the Pt loading at 0.32 wt % and increasing Sn loadings from 0 to 1.2 wt %, the size of PtSn clusters decreases from 4 nm to 1 nm. The optimized PtSn-ZSM-5 catalyst exhibits initial propane conversion of 65%, which is much higher than that of impregnated Pt/Sn-ZSM-5."

The ultrafast zeolite crystallization strategy developed by Yu et al. addresses the time-scale mismatch challenges in direct synthesis procedures for metal encapsulation by significantly reducing the crystallization time of ZSM-5 zeolites. This is achieved through a combination of precursor age, seed additives, and a fast-heating tubular reactor. The strategy allows for complete crystallization of ZSM-5 zeolites within 5 minutes at 170°C, or even 2 minutes at 190°C.

This ultrafast crystallization rate enables the full encapsulation of PtSn clusters within ZSM-5 zeolites. The formation of Pt nanoclusters occurs simultaneously with the rapid zeolite crystallization, as evidenced by the increase in Pt loadings in the silica matrix correlating with increasing zeolite crystallinity.

The strategy also affects the structure of the PtSn clusters. By fixing the Pt loading and increasing Sn loadings, the size of PtSn clusters can be reduced from 4 nm to 1 nm, allowing for better dispersion of the metal clusters within the zeolite framework.

In terms of catalytic performance, the optimized PtSn-ZSM-5 catalyst produced using this method exhibits significantly higher initial propane conversion (65%) compared to the impregnated Pt/Sn-ZSM-5 catalyst. This improved performance can be attributed to the better encapsulation and dispersion of PtSn clusters within the zeolite structure, which is made possible by the ultrafast crystallization strategy.

Yu等人开发的超快沸石结晶策略通过显著缩短ZSM-5沸石的结晶时间，解决了直接合成程序中金属包覆的时间尺度不匹配挑战。这一策略通过前驱体老化、种子添加剂和快速加热管式反应器的组合实现。该方法允许在170°C下5分钟内，或在190°C下仅2分钟内完成ZSM-5沸石的完全结晶。

这种超快结晶速率使PtSn簇能够完全包覆在ZSM-5沸石中。Pt纳米簇的形成与快速沸石结晶同步进行，这一点通过硅胶基质中Pt负载量随沸石结晶度增加而增加得到证实。

该策略还影响了PtSn簇的结构。通过固定Pt负载量并增加Sn负载量，可以将PtSn簇的尺寸从4 nm减小到1 nm，从而实现金属簇在沸石骨架中的更好分散。

在催化性能方面，使用这种方法制备的优化PtSn-ZSM-5催化剂表现出显著更高的初始丙烷转化率（65%），相比浸渍法制备的Pt/Sn-ZSM-5催化剂。这种性能的改善可归因于PtSn簇在沸石结构中更好的包覆和分散，这得益于超快结晶策略的应用。
