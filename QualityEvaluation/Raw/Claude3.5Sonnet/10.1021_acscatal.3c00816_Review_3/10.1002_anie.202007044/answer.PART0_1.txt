[1] "We herein demonstrate a novel strategy to overcome the mismatching issue, in which the crystallization of zeolites is expedited so as to synchronize it with the rapid formation of nanoclusters."

[2] "The in situ encapsulation can proceed very fast and complete in just a few minutes, where ultrasmall Pt clusters are formed and simultaneously confined into the high-silica ZSM-5 zeolite along with its crystallization."

[3] "The resultant nanoclusters-encapsulated ZSM-5 (Pt/Sn-ZSM-5) catalyst exhibits an excellent activity and selectivity in the dehydrogenation of propane to propene, an industrially important reaction for propene production."

[4] "The addition of Sn was found to be crucial to regulating the size as well as the dispersion of the Pt nanoclusters."

[5] "The ultrafast-encapsulated Pt/Sn-ZSM-5 zeolite exhibited a high conversion of about 70% in the beginning, and the conversion remained as high as 45% even after running for 24h. The selectivity was about 99% throughout the long-time reaction."

The ultrafast zeolite crystallization strategy developed by Yu et al. addresses the time-scale mismatch challenges in direct synthesis procedures for metal encapsulation by expediting the crystallization of zeolites to synchronize with the rapid formation of nanoclusters. This approach allows for the in-situ encapsulation of metal nanoclusters into zeolites in just a few minutes.

The effects of this strategy on the formation, structure, and catalytic performance of PtSn clusters within ZSM-5 zeolites are significant:

1. Formation: The ultrafast encapsulation enables the simultaneous formation of ultrasmall Pt clusters and their confinement into the high-silica ZSM-5 zeolite during crystallization.

2. Structure: The addition of Sn plays a crucial role in regulating the size and dispersion of Pt nanoclusters. This results in well-dispersed Pt nanoclusters within the Sn-containing zeolite matrix.

3. Catalytic performance: In the context of propane conversion, the Pt/Sn-ZSM-5 catalyst exhibits excellent activity and selectivity. It shows high initial conversion (about 70%) and maintains high conversion (45%) even after 24 hours of operation. The selectivity remains at about 99% throughout the long reaction time.

The ultrafast encapsulation method produces a catalyst with superior performance compared to traditional methods, demonstrating high stability, activity, and selectivity in the dehydrogenation of propane to propene.

Yu等人开发的超快速沸石晶化策略通过加速沸石的晶化来解决直接合成程序中金属包覆的时间尺度不匹配问题，使其与纳米簇的快速形成同步。这种方法允许在几分钟内实现金属纳米簇在沸石中的原位包覆。

这一策略对PtSn簇在ZSM-5沸石中的形成、结构和催化性能的影响是显著的：

1. 形成：超快速包覆实现了超小Pt簇的同时形成及其在高硅ZSM-5沸石晶化过程中的限制。

2. 结构：Sn的添加在调节Pt纳米簇的尺寸和分散性方面起着关键作用。这导致了Pt纳米簇在含Sn的沸石基质中的良好分散。

3. 催化性能：在丙烷转化方面，Pt/Sn-ZSM-5催化剂表现出优异的活性和选择性。它显示出高初始转化率（约70%），即使在运行24小时后仍保持高转化率（45%）。在长时间反应过程中，选择性一直保持在约99%。

超快速包覆方法生产的催化剂与传统方法相比表现出优越的性能，在丙烷脱氢制丙烯反应中展现出高稳定性、活性和选择性。
