[1] "We herein demonstrate a novel strategy to overcome the mismatching issue, in which the crystallization of zeolites is expedited so as to synchronize it with the rapid formation of nanoclusters."

[2] "The in situ encapsulation can proceed very fast and complete in just a few minutes, where ultrasmall Pt clusters are formed and simultaneously confined into the high-silica ZSM-5 zeolite along with its crystallization."

[3] "The resultant nanoclusters-encapsulated ZSM-5 (Pt/Sn-ZSM-5) catalyst exhibits an excellent activity and selectivity in the dehydrogenation of propane to propene, an industrially important reaction for propene production."

[4] "The addition of Sn was found to be crucial to regulating the size as well as the dispersion of the Pt nanoclusters."

[5] "The ultrafast-encapsulated Pt/Sn-ZSM-5 zeolite exhibited a high conversion of about 70% in the beginning, and the conversion remained as high as 45% even after running for 24h. The selectivity was about 99% throughout the long-time reaction."

The ultrafast zeolite crystallization strategy developed by Yu et al. addresses the time-scale mismatch challenges in direct synthesis procedures for metal encapsulation by expediting the crystallization of zeolites to synchronize with the rapid formation of nanoclusters. This allows for the in situ encapsulation to be completed in just a few minutes, with ultrasmall Pt clusters forming and being simultaneously confined within the high-silica ZSM-5 zeolite during crystallization.

The effects of this strategy on the formation, structure, and catalytic performance of PtSn clusters within ZSM-5 zeolites are significant:

1. Formation: The ultrafast encapsulation enables the simultaneous formation of Pt nanoclusters and ZSM-5 zeolite crystallization, resulting in well-dispersed, ultrasmall clusters.

2. Structure: The addition of Sn plays a crucial role in regulating the size and dispersion of Pt nanoclusters. The optimal Pt/Sn ratio results in nanoclusters with a size of approximately 1 nm.

3. Catalytic performance: In the context of propane conversion, the Pt/Sn-ZSM-5 catalyst exhibits excellent activity and selectivity. It demonstrates high initial conversion (about 70%) and maintains high performance even after 24 hours of operation (45% conversion). The selectivity remains at about 99% throughout the long reaction time.

The ultrafast encapsulation method produces a catalyst with superior stability and activity compared to traditional methods, making it highly effective for the dehydrogenation of propane to propene.

Yu等人开发的超快速沸石晶化策略通过加速沸石的晶化来解决直接合成程序中金属包覆的时间尺度不匹配问题，使其与纳米簇的快速形成同步。这使得原位包覆可以在短短几分钟内完成，超小的Pt簇在高硅ZSM-5沸石晶化过程中同时形成并被限制在其中。

这种策略对PtSn簇在ZSM-5沸石中的形成、结构和催化性能的影响是显著的：

1. 形成：超快速包覆使Pt纳米簇的形成和ZSM-5沸石的晶化同时进行，形成分散良好的超小簇。

2. 结构：Sn的添加在调节Pt纳米簇的大小和分散性方面起着关键作用。最佳的Pt/Sn比例可以得到大约1纳米大小的纳米簇。

3. 催化性能：在丙烷转化方面，Pt/Sn-ZSM-5催化剂表现出优异的活性和选择性。它显示出高初始转化率（约70%），即使在运行24小时后仍保持高性能（45%转化率）。在长时间反应过程中，选择性一直保持在约99%。

与传统方法相比，超快速包覆方法生产的催化剂具有更高的稳定性和活性，使其在丙烷脱氢生成丙烯的反应中非常有效。
