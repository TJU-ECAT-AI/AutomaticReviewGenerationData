[1] "We herein demonstrate a novel strategy to overcome the mismatching issue, in which the crystallization of zeolites is expedited so as to synchronize it with the rapid formation of nanoclusters."

[2] "The in situ encapsulation can proceed very fast and complete in just a few minutes, where ultrasmall Pt clusters are formed and simultaneously confined into the high-silica ZSM-5 zeolite along with its crystallization."

[3] "The resultant nanoclusters-encapsulated ZSM-5 (Pt/Sn-ZSM-5) catalyst exhibits an excellent activity and selectivity in the dehydrogenation of propane to propene, an industrially important reaction for propene production."

[4] "The addition of Sn was found to be crucial to regulating the size as well as the dispersion of the Pt nanoclusters."

[5] "The ultrafast-encapsulated Pt/Sn-ZSM-5 zeolite exhibited a high conversion of about 70% in the beginning, and the conversion remained as high as 45% even after running for 24h. The selectivity was about 99% throughout the long-time reaction."

The ultrafast zeolite crystallization strategy developed by Yu et al. addresses the time-scale mismatch challenges in direct synthesis procedures for metal encapsulation by expediting the crystallization of zeolites to synchronize with the rapid formation of nanoclusters. This approach allows for the in situ encapsulation to proceed very quickly, completing in just a few minutes.

The effects of this strategy on the formation, structure, and catalytic performance of PtSn clusters within ZSM-5 zeolites are significant:

1. Formation: The strategy enables the simultaneous formation of ultrasmall Pt clusters and their confinement into the high-silica ZSM-5 zeolite during crystallization.

2. Structure: The addition of Sn plays a crucial role in regulating the size and dispersion of the Pt nanoclusters. This results in well-dispersed nanoclusters within the zeolite matrix.

3. Catalytic performance: In the context of propane conversion, the Pt/Sn-ZSM-5 catalyst produced by this method exhibits excellent activity and selectivity. It shows high conversion (initially about 70%, remaining at 45% after 24 hours) and maintains a selectivity of about 99% throughout long-term reaction for the dehydrogenation of propane to propene.

The ultrafast encapsulation method results in a catalyst with superior performance compared to traditional methods, demonstrating both high activity and long-term stability in propane dehydrogenation.

Yu等人开发的超快速沸石晶化策略通过加速沸石的晶化来解决直接合成程序中金属包覆的时间尺度不匹配挑战，使其与纳米簇的快速形成同步。这种方法允许原位包覆过程非常快速地进行，仅在几分钟内就能完成。

这种策略对PtSn簇在ZSM-5沸石中的形成、结构和催化性能的影响是显著的：

1. 形成：该策略使超小Pt簇的同时形成和在晶化过程中被限制在高硅ZSM-5沸石中成为可能。

2. 结构：Sn的添加在调节Pt纳米簇的大小和分散度方面起着至关重要的作用。这导致了纳米簇在沸石基质中的良好分散。

3. 催化性能：在丙烷转化的背景下，通过这种方法生产的Pt/Sn-ZSM-5催化剂表现出优异的活性和选择性。在丙烷脱氢制丙烯的反应中，它显示出高转化率（初始约70%，24小时后仍保持在45%），并在长期反应过程中保持约99%的选择性。

与传统方法相比，超快速包覆方法产生的催化剂在丙烷脱氢反应中表现出卓越的性能，同时展现出高活性和长期稳定性。
