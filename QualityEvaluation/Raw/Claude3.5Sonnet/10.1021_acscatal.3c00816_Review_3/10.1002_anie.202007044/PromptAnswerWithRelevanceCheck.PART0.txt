[1] "We herein demonstrate a novel strategy to overcome the mismatching issue, in which the crystallization of zeolites is expedited so as to synchronize it with the rapid formation of nanoclusters."

[2] "The in situ encapsulation can proceed very fast and complete in just a few minutes, where ultrasmall Pt clusters are formed and simultaneously confined into the high-silica ZSM-5 zeolite along with its crystallization."

[3] "The resultant nanoclusters-encapsulated ZSM-5 (Pt/Sn-ZSM-5) catalyst exhibits an excellent activity and selectivity in the dehydrogenation of propane to propene, an industrially important reaction for propene production."

[4] "The addition of Sn was found to be crucial to regulating the size as well as the dispersion of the Pt nanoclusters."

[5] "The ultrafast-encapsulated Pt/Sn-ZSM-5 zeolite exhibited a high conversion of about 70% in the beginning, and the conversion remained as high as 45% even after running for 24h. The selectivity was about 99% throughout the long-time reaction."

The ultrafast zeolite crystallization strategy developed by Yu et al. addresses the time-scale mismatch challenges in direct synthesis procedures for metal encapsulation by expediting the crystallization of zeolites to synchronize with the rapid formation of nanoclusters. This approach allows for the in situ encapsulation of metal nanoclusters into zeolites to be completed in just a few minutes.

The effects of this strategy on the formation, structure, and catalytic performance of PtSn clusters within ZSM-5 zeolites are significant:

1. Formation: The ultrafast encapsulation method enables the simultaneous formation of ultrasmall Pt clusters and their confinement within the high-silica ZSM-5 zeolite during crystallization.

2. Structure: The addition of Sn plays a crucial role in regulating the size and dispersion of Pt nanoclusters. This results in well-dispersed nanoclusters within the zeolite matrix, with optimal sizes around 1-2 nm when the Pt/Sn ratio is properly adjusted.

3. Catalytic performance: In the context of propane conversion, the Pt/Sn-ZSM-5 catalyst produced by this method exhibits excellent activity and selectivity in the dehydrogenation of propane to propene. The catalyst shows high initial conversion (about 70%) and maintains good performance over extended periods (45% conversion after 24 hours). Moreover, it demonstrates remarkably high selectivity (about 99%) throughout the long reaction time.

The ultrafast encapsulation strategy results in a catalyst with superior stability, activity, and selectivity compared to traditional methods, making it highly promising for industrial applications in propane dehydrogenation.

Yu等人开发的超快速沸石晶化策略通过加速沸石的晶化来解决直接合成程序中金属包覆的时间尺度不匹配问题，使其与纳米簇的快速形成同步。这种方法允许在短短几分钟内完成金属纳米簇在沸石中的原位包覆。

这一策略对PtSn簇在ZSM-5沸石中的形成、结构和催化性能的影响是显著的：

1. 形成：超快速包覆方法实现了超小Pt簇的同步形成和在高硅ZSM-5沸石晶化过程中的限制。

2. 结构：Sn的添加在调节Pt纳米簇的尺寸和分散度方面起着至关重要的作用。当Pt/Sn比例适当调整时，这导致了沸石基质中纳米簇的良好分散，最佳尺寸约为1-2 nm。

3. 催化性能：在丙烷转化的背景下，通过这种方法制备的Pt/Sn-ZSM-5催化剂在丙烷脱氢制丙烯反应中表现出优异的活性和选择性。该催化剂显示出高初始转化率（约70%）并在长时间内保持良好性能（24小时后仍有45%的转化率）。此外，它在长时间反应中表现出极高的选择性（约99%）。

超快速包覆策略产生的催化剂在稳定性、活性和选择性方面优于传统方法，使其在丙烷脱氢的工业应用中具有很高的潜力。
