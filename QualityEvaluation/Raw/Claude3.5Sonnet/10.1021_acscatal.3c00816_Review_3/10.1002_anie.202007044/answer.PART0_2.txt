[2] "The in situ encapsulation can proceed very fast and complete in just a few minutes, where ultrasmall Pt clusters are formed and simultaneously confined into the high-silica ZSM-5 zeolite along with its crystallization."

[3] "The role of Sn is supposed to modulate the interaction between the Pt precursor and the zeolite precursor, thus affecting size and dispersion of the Pt nanoclusters."

[4] "The resultant nanoclusters-encapsulated ZSM-5 (Pt/Sn-ZSM-5) catalyst exhibits an excellent activity and selectivity in the dehydrogenation of propane to propene, an industrially important reaction for propene production."

[5] "The ultrafast-encapsulated Pt/Sn-ZSM-5 zeolite exhibited a high conversion of about 70% in the beginning, and the conversion remained as high as 45% even after running for 24h. The selectivity was about 99% throughout the long-time reaction."

The ultrafast zeolite crystallization strategy developed by Yu et al. addresses the time-scale mismatch challenges in direct synthesis procedures for metal encapsulation by expediting the crystallization of zeolites to synchronize with the rapid formation of nanoclusters. This approach allows for the in situ encapsulation to proceed very quickly, completing in just a few minutes.

The effects of this strategy on the formation, structure, and catalytic performance of PtSn clusters within ZSM-5 zeolites are significant:

1. Formation: Ultrasmall Pt clusters are formed and simultaneously confined into the high-silica ZSM-5 zeolite during its crystallization. The addition of Sn modulates the interaction between the Pt precursor and the zeolite precursor, affecting the size and dispersion of the Pt nanoclusters.

2. Structure: The resulting Pt/Sn-ZSM-5 contains well-dispersed nanoclusters within the zeolite framework, with optimal sizes around 1-2 nm when the Pt/Sn ratio is properly controlled.

3. Catalytic performance: In the context of propane conversion, the Pt/Sn-ZSM-5 catalyst exhibits excellent activity and selectivity in the dehydrogenation of propane to propene. It demonstrates high initial conversion (about 70%) and maintains good performance over extended periods (45% conversion after 24 hours). The selectivity remains consistently high at about 99% throughout the long-time reaction.

This ultrafast encapsulation method results in a catalyst with superior performance and stability compared to conventional preparation methods, making it highly promising for industrial applications in propene production.

Yu等人开发的超快速沸石结晶策略通过加速沸石的结晶过程来与纳米簇的快速形成同步，从而解决了直接合成程序中金属包覆的时间尺度不匹配问题。这种方法使得原位包覆过程能够非常快速地进行，仅在几分钟内就能完成。

这种策略对PtSn簇在ZSM-5沸石中的形成、结构和催化性能的影响是显著的：

1. 形成：超小的Pt簇在高硅ZSM-5沸石结晶过程中同时形成并被限制在其中。Sn的添加调节了Pt前驱体和沸石前驱体之间的相互作用，从而影响Pt纳米簇的大小和分散性。

2. 结构：生成的Pt/Sn-ZSM-5包含在沸石骨架中均匀分散的纳米簇，当Pt/Sn比例适当控制时，其最佳尺寸约为1-2纳米。

3. 催化性能：在丙烷转化的背景下，Pt/Sn-ZSM-5催化剂在丙烷脱氢生成丙烯的反应中表现出优异的活性和选择性。它表现出高初始转化率（约70%）并在长时间内保持良好性能（24小时后仍有45%的转化率）。在长时间反应过程中，选择性始终保持在约99%的高水平。

这种超快速包覆方法产生的催化剂与传统制备方法相比，具有更优越的性能和稳定性，使其在丙烯生产的工业应用中具有很高的前景。
