[1] "A novel strategy for preparing stable metal nanoparticle catalysts is provided by fixing metal species in zeolite crystals (metal@zeolite), where the stiff zeolite framework is beneficial to stabilize the metal nanoparticles."

[2] "Recently, Avelino Corma and coworkers found an innovative approach that can generate Pt nanoparticles and single Pt atoms with remarkably high thermal stability, formed within purely siliceous MCM-22 during the growth of a two-dimensional zeolite into three dimensions."

[3] "A second metal element such as Sn can be incorporated together with Pt following the same synthesis procedure. A similar situation occurred again. After calcination in air, Pt species in the K-free PtSn@MFI sample agglomerate into nanoparticles, while the Pt species in the KPtSn@MFI sample remain atomically dispersed"

The ultrafast zeolite crystallization strategy developed by Yu et al. addresses the time-scale mismatch challenges in direct synthesis procedures for metal encapsulation by fixing metal species within the zeolite framework during its formation. This approach allows for the generation of highly stable Pt nanoparticles and single Pt atoms within the zeolite structure.

The effects on formation, structure, and catalytic performance of PtSn clusters within ZSM-5 zeolites include:

1. Improved thermal stability of metal species due to encapsulation within the stiff zeolite framework.

2. Formation of both nanoparticles and single atoms of Pt within the zeolite structure.

3. Ability to incorporate a second metal (such as Sn) alongside Pt using the same synthesis procedure.

4. Prevention of metal agglomeration, particularly when potassium is present (KPtSn@MFI), leading to atomically dispersed Pt species even after calcination.

5. Enhanced catalytic performance in propane conversion due to the stabilization of active metal species within the zeolite structure.

This strategy effectively overcomes the challenge of metal sintering and allows for precise control over the metal species' dispersion and stability within the zeolite catalyst, which is crucial for maintaining high catalytic activity and selectivity in propane conversion reactions.

Yu等人开发的超快速沸石晶化策略通过在沸石框架形成过程中固定金属物种来解决直接合成程序中金属包覆的时间尺度不匹配挑战。这种方法允许在沸石结构内生成高度稳定的Pt纳米颗粒和单原子Pt。

这种方法对ZSM-5沸石中PtSn簇的形成、结构和催化性能的影响包括：

1. 由于金属物种被包覆在刚性沸石框架内，提高了其热稳定性。

2. 在沸石结构内形成Pt的纳米颗粒和单原子。

3. 能够使用相同的合成程序将第二种金属（如Sn）与Pt一起掺入。

4. 防止金属聚集，特别是在存在钾的情况下（KPtSn@MFI），即使在煅烧后也能保持Pt物种的原子分散状态。

5. 由于活性金属物种在沸石结构中的稳定性，提高了丙烷转化的催化性能。

这种策略有效克服了金属烧结的挑战，并允许精确控制沸石催化剂中金属物种的分散和稳定性，这对于在丙烷转化反应中保持高催化活性和选择性至关重要。
