[1] "Without the addition of the protective agent, PtSn clusters with ca. 1 nm size can be in situ encapsulated inside the high-silica ZSM-5 zeolites through a rapid one-pot synthesis procedure."

[2] "In comparison with the monometallic Pt/ZSM-5 and the impregnated Pt/Sn-ZSM-5-im, the ultrafast-encapsulated Pt/Sn-ZSM-5 catalyst exhibits a superior catalytic stability. Its propane conversion remains as high as 45% after 24 h in the PDH reaction at 600 C."

The ultrafast zeolite crystallization strategy developed by Yu et al. addresses the time-scale mismatch challenges in direct synthesis procedures for metal encapsulation by enabling rapid one-pot synthesis of PtSn clusters within ZSM-5 zeolites. This approach results in the formation of small (~1 nm) PtSn clusters encapsulated inside high-silica ZSM-5 zeolites without the need for protective agents. The strategy significantly improves the structure and catalytic performance of the resulting catalyst. Compared to monometallic Pt/ZSM-5 and impregnated Pt/Sn-ZSM-5 catalysts, the ultrafast-encapsulated Pt/Sn-ZSM-5 catalyst demonstrates superior catalytic stability, maintaining a high propane conversion of 45% after 24 hours of propane dehydrogenation reaction at 600°C.

Yu等人开发的超快速沸石晶化策略通过实现PtSn簇在ZSM-5沸石内的快速一锅合成,解决了直接合成程序中金属包覆的时间尺度不匹配挑战。这种方法导致小尺寸(~1 nm)的PtSn簇被包覆在高硅ZSM-5沸石内,而无需使用保护剂。该策略显著改善了所得催化剂的结构和催化性能。与单金属Pt/ZSM-5和浸渍法制备的Pt/Sn-ZSM-5催化剂相比,超快速包覆的Pt/Sn-ZSM-5催化剂表现出优异的催化稳定性,在600°C下进行24小时丙烷脱氢反应后仍保持45%的高丙烷转化率。
