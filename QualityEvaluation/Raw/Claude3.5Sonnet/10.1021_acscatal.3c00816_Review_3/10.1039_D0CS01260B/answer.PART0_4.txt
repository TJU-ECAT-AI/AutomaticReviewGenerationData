[1] "Without the addition of the protective agent, PtSn clusters with ca. 1 nm size can be in situ encapsulated inside the high-silica ZSM-5 zeolites through a rapid one-pot synthesis procedure."

[2] "In comparison with the monometallic Pt/ZSM-5 and the impregnated Pt/Sn-ZSM-5-im, the ultrafast-encapsulated Pt/Sn-ZSM-5 catalyst exhibits a superior catalytic stability. Its propane conversion remains as high as 45% after 24 h in the PDH reaction at 600 C."

The ultrafast zeolite crystallization strategy developed by Yu et al. addresses the time-scale mismatch challenges in direct synthesis procedures for metal encapsulation by allowing rapid in situ encapsulation of PtSn clusters within high-silica ZSM-5 zeolites through a one-pot synthesis procedure. This approach results in the formation of small PtSn clusters with approximately 1 nm size inside the zeolite structure. The ultrafast-encapsulated Pt/Sn-ZSM-5 catalyst demonstrates superior catalytic stability compared to monometallic Pt/ZSM-5 and impregnated Pt/Sn-ZSM-5 catalysts. In terms of catalytic performance, the ultrafast-encapsulated catalyst maintains a high propane conversion of 45% after 24 hours of propane dehydrogenation reaction at 600°C, indicating improved long-term stability and catalytic activity.

Yu等人开发的超快速沸石结晶策略通过一锅法快速原位包覆高硅ZSM-5沸石内的PtSn簇，解决了金属包覆直接合成程序中的时间尺度不匹配挑战。这种方法导致在沸石结构内形成约1纳米大小的小PtSn簇。超快速包覆的Pt/Sn-ZSM-5催化剂与单金属Pt/ZSM-5和浸渍法制备的Pt/Sn-ZSM-5催化剂相比，表现出优越的催化稳定性。在催化性能方面，超快速包覆催化剂在600°C下进行24小时丙烷脱氢反应后，仍保持45%的高丙烷转化率，表明其具有改善的长期稳定性和催化活性。
