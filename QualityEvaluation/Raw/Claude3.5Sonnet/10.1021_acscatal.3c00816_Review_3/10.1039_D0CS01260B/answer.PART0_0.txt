[1] "Without the addition of the protective agent, PtSn clusters with ca. 1 nm size can be in situ encapsulated inside the high-silica ZSM-5 zeolites through a rapid one-pot synthesis procedure."

[2] "In comparison with the monometallic Pt/ZSM-5 and the impregnated Pt/Sn-ZSM-5-im, the ultrafast-encapsulated Pt/Sn-ZSM-5 catalyst exhibits a superior catalytic stability. Its propane conversion remains as high as 45% after 24 h in the PDH reaction at 600 C."

The ultrafast zeolite crystallization strategy developed by Yu et al. addresses the time-scale mismatch challenges by enabling rapid in situ encapsulation of PtSn clusters within high-silica ZSM-5 zeolites in a one-pot synthesis procedure. This approach results in the formation of small PtSn clusters around 1 nm in size without requiring additional protective agents. The encapsulated PtSn clusters exhibit superior catalytic stability compared to monometallic Pt/ZSM-5 and impregnated Pt/Sn-ZSM-5 catalysts. In propane dehydrogenation reactions at 600°C, the ultrafast-encapsulated Pt/Sn-ZSM-5 catalyst maintains a high propane conversion of 45% even after 24 hours of operation, demonstrating its enhanced performance and longevity.

Yu等人开发的超快沸石结晶策略通过在一锅合成过程中实现PtSn簇的快速原位包裹在高硅ZSM-5沸石中,解决了时间尺度不匹配的挑战。这种方法无需额外的保护剂就能形成约1纳米大小的小PtSn簇。包裹的PtSn簇比单金属Pt/ZSM-5和浸渍Pt/Sn-ZSM-5催化剂表现出更优异的催化稳定性。在600°C的丙烷脱氢反应中,超快包裹的Pt/Sn-ZSM-5催化剂即使在运行24小时后仍保持45%的高丙烷转化率,展示了其增强的性能和耐久性。
