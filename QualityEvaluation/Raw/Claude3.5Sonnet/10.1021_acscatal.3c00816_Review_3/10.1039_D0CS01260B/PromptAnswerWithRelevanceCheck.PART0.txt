[1] "Without the addition of the protective agent, PtSn clusters with ca. 1 nm size can be in situ encapsulated inside the high-silica ZSM-5 zeolites through a rapid one-pot synthesis procedure."

[2] "In comparison with the monometallic Pt/ZSM-5 and the impregnated Pt/Sn-ZSM-5-im, the ultrafast-encapsulated Pt/Sn-ZSM-5 catalyst exhibits a superior catalytic stability. Its propane conversion remains as high as 45% after 24 h in the PDH reaction at 600 C."

The ultrafast zeolite crystallization strategy developed by Yu et al. addresses the time-scale mismatch challenges by enabling rapid in situ encapsulation of PtSn clusters within high-silica ZSM-5 zeolites in a one-pot synthesis procedure. This approach results in the formation of small PtSn clusters around 1 nm in size without requiring additional protective agents. The encapsulated PtSn clusters exhibit superior catalytic stability compared to monometallic Pt/ZSM-5 and impregnated Pt/Sn-ZSM-5 catalysts. In propane dehydrogenation reactions at 600°C, the ultrafast-encapsulated Pt/Sn-ZSM-5 catalyst maintains a high propane conversion of 45% even after 24 hours of operation, demonstrating its enhanced performance and longevity.

The ultrafast zeolite crystallization strategy developed by Yu et al. addresses the time-scale mismatch challenges in direct synthesis procedures for metal encapsulation by enabling rapid one-pot synthesis of PtSn clusters within ZSM-5 zeolites. This approach results in the formation of small (~1 nm) PtSn clusters encapsulated inside high-silica ZSM-5 zeolites without the need for protective agents. The strategy significantly improves the structure and catalytic performance of the resulting catalyst. Compared to monometallic Pt/ZSM-5 and impregnated Pt/Sn-ZSM-5 catalysts, the ultrafast-encapsulated Pt/Sn-ZSM-5 catalyst demonstrates superior catalytic stability, maintaining a high propane conversion of 45% after 24 hours of propane dehydrogenation reaction at 600°C.
