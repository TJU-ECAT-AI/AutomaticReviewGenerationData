Abstract
Considering the advantages of microwave combustion technique with the possibility of utilizing cheap precursors, short reaction time and
nanocrystalline products, the present work reports the synthesis of silver doped lanthanum chromites. Structural and physicochemical properties
were investigated with the help of various characterization techniques. The FTIR spectrum reveals the characteristic metal oxygen bands for Cr–O
stretching at 604 cm1, O–Cr–O bending mode at 419 cm1 and Ag–O bands at 561 cm1 and 443 cm1. The powder X-ray diffraction patterns
exhibit the formation of hexagonal structure with the dopant peaks at 2u values of 38.38, 44.18 and 64.48 apart from the peaks corresponding to
lanthanum chromite. TGA analysis of the samples shows stable behavior of the product. Nanosized particles with size as small as 7–8 nm and
larger ones 20–26 nm are observed from transmission electron micrographs. Room temperature magnetic study exhibits hysteresis loop
formation during magnetization of samples.

1. Introduction
Lanthanum based perovskites (ABO3) ﬁnd interesting
applications such as thermal indicators and barriers [1,2],
interconnect materials for SOFCs [3], ionic conductors [4] and
photoctalysts [5], due to their high temperature and chemical
stability. The structural characteristics of these materials can be
modiﬁed when synthesized in nanosize together with good
compositional homogeneity and stoichiometry [6–13]. They
constitute a good class of combustion catalysts as they are
found to be relatively stable in both oxidizing and reducing
atmospheres [14]; however, sometimes they are less efﬁcient.
Attempts to enhance their efﬁciency include doping these
perovskites with noble metals, such as Rh, Ag and Au [15–20].
Both A site and B site doping are possible bearing mixed
valence states and enhanced mobility of oxygen in the lattice
[21,22].
The method of synthesis adopted also inﬂuences the material
properties signiﬁcantly. Most popular methods of synthesis
include hydrothermal, spray pyrolysis, solid state reaction,
microwave aided synthesis, sol–gel [23–39], etc.
In the present work, we report the synthesis of nanoparticles
of silver doped lanthanum chromite for the ﬁrst time. The
samples were synthesized by microwave combustion method;
partial doping at both A site and B site have been achieved with
short reaction time of few minutes yielding perovskites of the
types La1xAgxCrO3 and LaCr1xAgxO3. Further, the inﬂuence
of dopant concentration, fuel/oxidizer ratio and precursor salts
on material properties is investigated. Thus, the main purpose
of this study is to explore the structural and ionic changes in the
substituted perovskite with reference to pristine sample.
2. Experimental details
All the chemicals used were of A.R. grade. The salt
precursors, i.e. lanthanum nitrate (La(NO3)36H2O), chromium
nitrate (Cr(NO3)9H2O) and urea (NH2CONH2) as fuel were
from Loba Chemie, India, while silver nitrate (AgNO3) was
from Qualigens, India. Lanthanum chromite was synthesized
by initially mixing the precursor salts together in stoichiometric
amounts, i.e. 1:1 equimolar ratio followed by the addition of
urea as fuel (0.4 M), and to this was added 50 ml of double
distilled water. The stoichiometric composition of the mixture

was calculated based on the oxidizing valencies of metal
nitrates and reducing valency of urea [40]. Silver doped
samples were prepared by partial substitution of host atoms (La
or Cr) by varying the concentration of added silver from 0.02 to
0.06 M, the molar concentrations of host atoms in the reaction
were also varied proportionately. The resulting mixtures (for
undoped and doped perovskites) were stirred for few minutes at
room temperature and subjected to evaporation on a hot plate so
as to obtain a gel. The gels were subjected to microwaves (0.1–
0.9 kW power) using a domestic microwave oven (MG-555F
Model) for auto combustion and the resulting products were
cooled to room temperature. During synthesis, the fuel to
oxidizer ratio was maintained as 1 while, the irradiation time
was varied from 5 to 10 min so as to obtain pure phase products.
The powders were characterized using various analytical
techniques.
3. Characterization
Fourier transform infrared spectra (FTIR) of all the samples
were recorded on a Shimadzu 8400 spectrophotometer over the
range of 400–4000 cm1 using KBr as a mulling agent. X-ray
diffraction analysis of the powders was carried out on a Bruker
AXSD-8 Advance X-ray diffractometer with monochromatic
CuKa radiation (l = 1.5406 A
˚
´ ). Silicon was used as an external
standard for correction due to instrumental broadening.
Diffraction data were collected from 208 to 808 at a scan rate
of 0.18/min. Energy dispersive analysis of X-rays (EDAX) was
taken on an analytical instrument (JEOL JSM 6360A). The data
were recorded by coating the ﬁlms of the samples with Ag–Pd
alloy using vapor deposition technique. Transmission electron
micrographs (TEMs) of the samples were observed under the
Philips CM-200 instrument at an accelerating voltage of
200 kV. Suspensions of the samples in isopropanol were well
dispersed and loaded on carbon coated grids of 200 mesh size.
The grids were then dried under IR lamp and viewed under the
microscope. The TG–DTA curves of samples were recorded in
an inert atmosphere at a heating rate of 10 8C min1 using a
Shimadzu instrument (Model DTG-60H). Lakeshore’s Vibrat-
ing Sample Magnetometer (Model 7307) was used to perform
magnetic measurements.
4. Results and discussion
The products were obtained through an exothermic reaction
occurring between the reactant precursor’s (metal nitrates) and
urea as a fuel.
The combustion reaction can be represented as follows:
During synthesis, the nitrates readily melt in their water of
crystallization and aqueous solutions always absorb microwave
radiations efﬁciently which are the source of energy. Additional
heat is evolved upon oxidation of chromium which takes place
during decomposition of nitrate salts. The evolved heat is the
cause for continuous heating of sample after removal of water
leading to decomposition of the precursors to give oxide phase.
The

samples 
of 
LaCrO3, 
La1xAgxCrO3
LaCr1xAgxO3 (x refers to the fraction of La and Cr substituted
by Ag) thus obtained were analysed using various analytical
techniques. From the results, it was observed that the
microwave power, oxidizer to fuel ratio and irradiation time
determined the purity of the samples. At microwave power
below 0.42 kW the product formation is not observed, at
0.42 kW partial product formation takes place while, 0.56 kW
power yields pure phase product. At higher power levels the
reaction is observed to be explosive in nature. The optimum
irradiation time to obtain pure phase product is observed to be
10 min with an oxidizer to fuel ratio of 1.
‘4.1. FT-IR spectroscopy
Preliminary analysis of samples to ensure the formation of
products was carried out by recording the FTIR spectrum of
each of the products. Fig. 1(a) and (b) shows the FTIR spectra
of as obtained samples and the one sintered at 800 8C for 4 h,
respectively. The absorption peaks at 600 and 400 cm1 can be
ascribed to Cr–O bond and O–Cr–O deformation vibrations
indicating formation of product, while, narrow bands at 1085–
1385 cm1 correspond to NO3
 of unreacted precursor salts
and N–H stretching is observed at 1485 cm1.
In Fig. 1(c) and (d) are given the FTIR spectra of silver
doped (both A site and B site), lanthanum chromite samples
which exhibit increment in band assignment of Cr–O stretching
and O–Cr–O deformation vibrations implying substitution of
Ag+ ions at lanthanum and chromium sub lattice. The bands at
561 cm1and 443 cm1 represent Ag–O bond formation.
The close frequency correlation of these bands in the spectra
with those reported in the literature [41–43] conﬁrms the
presence of perovskite like oxide together with doping of silver
(Ag+) ions in A and B sub lattice.
4.2. X-ray diffraction analysis
Fig. 2 shows the X-ray diffractograms of the LaCrO3
samples synthesized at 0.42 kWand 0.56 kW microwave power
and the latter sample sintered at 200 and 800 8C for a period of
4 h. Comparison of the X-ray diffractograms reveals the
formation of pure phase product at microwave power of

0.56 kW whereas at 0.42 kW power presence of unreacted
precursor salts can be noted, the crystallinity of the product is
enhanced on sintering the sample. The peaks at 2u values of
32.3, 39.9, 46.4, 67.8 and 77.1 represent characteristic planes
(1 1 0), (0 2 1), (2 0 2), (2 2 0) and (3 1 2) of hexagonal LaCrO3
(PDF No. 33-0702) while reactant peak is observed at 27.9,
respectively (PDF No. 22-1126). The structure factor (intensity
of reﬂection) is dependent on both, the positions of each atom
and electron density distribution during phase formation.
X-ray diffractograms of Ag doped (both A site and B site)
LaCrO3 are shown in Figs. 3 and 4. The dopant concentration
was varied from 0.02 to 0.06 M. Peaks corresponding to
metallic silver are observed at 2u values of 38.3, 44.1 and 64.4
in addition to the characteristic peaks of lanthanum chromite.
The data have been correlated with JCPDS pattern (04-783).
Further, increment in the intensity of the peak corresponding to
silver is observed with the increase in dopant concentration.
Peak at 27.9 at higher doping level (0.06 M of Ag) depicts the
presence of unreacted precursor salts.
The crystallite size of the particles calculated using the
Scherrer formula [44,45], by considering the half widths of the
XRD peaks is given in Table 1, and dopant concentration is
expressed as a fraction of host atoms. The lattice parameters
exhibit signiﬁcant differences on Ag doping in comparison to
LaCrO3. The expansion in volume can be attributed to the
mismatch of ionic radii and co-ordination number (i.e.
dodecahedron and polyhedron). The table also includes the
theoretical densities calculated for each lattice. The differences

in the theoretical densities can be accounted in terms of
variation in the unit cell volume, molar mass of compounds and
the A or B site deﬁciencies in the crystal lattice. The results of
EDAX are summarized in Table 2, in case of lanthanum
chromite the atomic ratio for La/Cr is expected to be 1,
however, in the present case lower ratio indicates the formation
of Cr-rich phase. Partial substitution of dopant at A site with
higher molar concentration (0.06 M) of silver exhibits a shift in
composition to oxygen excess in perovskite with a slight B site
ion deﬁciency.
EDAX of samples with B site doping (Table 2) clearly shows
the formation of silver rich phase of the perovskite at lower
doping level (0.02 M) while at higher concentration of silver
(i.e. 0.06 M) oxygen ion deﬁciency can be observed. Thus, the
solid phase concentrations of elements in the sample could be
determined, the discrepancy in the quantitative data is
attributable to volatilization of chromium vapor [5] during
microwave combustion synthesis.

4.3. Morphological evidence
The micrograph (TEM) of lanthanum chromite powder
synthesized by microwave combustion route is shown in
Fig. 5(a). From the micrograph, one can note the formation of
particles with mixed morphologies, some being spherical
while others appear to be hexagonal in shape. Individual
particles with clear grain boundaries are observable. The
particles are relatively large in size with average particle size of
57 nm. The size distribution appears to be broad 30–
118 nm shown by the bar diagram with majority being on the
higher side. Ring pattern exhibits polycrystalline nature of the
sample Fig. 5(a).
Micrographs of samples with silver doped at A site (0.02 M
and 0.06 M) are shown in Fig. 5(b) and (c), respectively. The
particles in both the samples show spherical morphology, the
size being signiﬁcantly smaller in comparison to that of pure
lanthanum chromite. The average size of particles is 7–8 nm
in both the cases. The relative density of smaller particles is
higher at 0.02 M doping level Fig. 5(b). Higher silver
concentration of 0.06 M Fig. 5(c) leads to a slight increase
in particle size distribution of 4–15 nm. Diffraction patterns
exhibit array of spots related to de Broglie wavelength and
polycrystallinity of the samples.
Fig. 5(d) and (e) depicts the micrographs of lanthanum
chromite with silver doped at B site. Irregular shaped
morphology of the particles can be observed from the
micrographs. The particle size distribution is 22–30 nm
and 18–22 nm, respectively for 0.02 and 0.06 M doped silver
(Table 1). Polycrystalline nature of the samples is observed
from the diffraction pattern.
The decrease in particle size in case of doped samples can be
accounted in terms of distortion in structure brought about by
the dopant ions.
4.4. Thermal analysis
The thermograms (curves a) for LaCrO3, La0.06Ag0.02CrO3
and LaCr0.06Ag0.02O3 are shown in Fig. 6. A negligible weight
loss of 1–2% is noted which can be attributed to trace levels of

grams (curves b) exhibit an endotherm at 90 8C corresponding
to desorption of adsorbed water. The endotherm at temperature
600 8C is attributable to the decomposition of traces of
precursors and organic fuel (urea).
4.5. Magnetic properties
Fig. 7 shows the magnetograms obtained for LaCrO3 and
doped samples. Hysteresis loops are observed in each case with
low coercivity indicating formation of soft chromites. Table 3
gives the values of saturation magnetization (Ms), retentivity
(Mr) and coercivity (HCi) evaluated from the ﬁgure. The doped
samples exhibit increase in saturation magnetization that can be
attributed to non magnetic nature of Ag.
5. Conclusions
LaCrO3 and silver doped lanthanum chromite nanoparticles
have been synthesized by microwave combustion route. Pure
phase products are obtained at microwave power of 0.56 kW,
irradiation time of 10 min and fuel to oxidizer ratio of 1.
Average size of LaCrO3 particles is 57 nm, while the silver
doped samples have a ﬁner particle size of 7–8 and 20–26,
respectively, for A site and B site doping. Increase in coercivity
and saturation magnetization values of doped samples is
attributed to non magnetic nature of silver.
