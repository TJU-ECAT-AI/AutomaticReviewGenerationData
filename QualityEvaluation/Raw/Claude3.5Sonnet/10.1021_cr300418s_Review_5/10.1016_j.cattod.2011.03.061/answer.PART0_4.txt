[1] "Characterization studies by X-ray diffraction (XRD), Raman spectroscopy, BET, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), temperature-programmed reduction mass spectroscopy (CH4 TPR-MS) and temperature-programmed desorption of oxygen (O2-TPD) were carried out."

[2] "The bulk structure was determined by Raman and XRD and the phase segregation was studied by SEM. The reducibility was studied by CH4 TPR-MS. The oxygen desorption behavior was studied by O2-TPD. The chemical states and surface composition has been analyzed using XPS."

Raman spectroscopy, in combination with other analytical techniques like XRD, SEM, XPS, TPR-MS, and O2-TPD, contributes to a comprehensive characterization of doped catalysts by providing information on their bulk structure, phase composition, reducibility, oxygen desorption behavior, and surface chemical states. While the literature does not provide specific details about Raman spectral features and their relationship to catalyst properties for Ce-doped CoCr2O4, it suggests that the combination of these techniques allows for a thorough understanding of the catalyst's composition, structure, and reactivity. The use of multiple complementary techniques enables researchers to correlate spectral features with various catalyst properties, potentially providing insights into how cerium doping affects the spinel structure, metal ion distribution, and oxygen mobility in the cobalt chromite catalyst.
