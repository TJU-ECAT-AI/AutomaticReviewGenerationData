[1] "Characterization studies by X-ray diffraction (XRD), Raman spectroscopy, BET, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), temperature-programmed reduction mass spectroscopy (CH4 TPR-MS) and temperature-programmed desorption of oxygen (O2-TPD) were carried out."

[2] "The bulk structure was determined by Raman and XRD and the phase segregation was studied by SEM. The reducibility was studied by CH4 TPR-MS. The oxygen desorption behavior was studied by O2-TPD. The chemical states and surface composition has been analyzed using XPS."

Raman spectroscopy, in combination with other analytical techniques like XRD, SEM, XPS, TPR-MS, and TPD, contributes to a comprehensive characterization of doped catalysts by providing information on bulk structure, phase segregation, reducibility, oxygen desorption behavior, and surface composition. While the literature does not provide specific details on Raman spectral features for Ce-doped CoCr2O4, it indicates that Raman spectroscopy is used alongside XRD to determine the bulk structure of the catalysts. This multi-technique approach allows for a more complete understanding of the catalyst's composition, structure, and potential in situ behavior. The combination of these methods provides insights into how doping affects the catalyst's properties, such as reducibility and oxygen mobility, which are crucial for catalytic performance in methane combustion.

拉曼光谱与其他分析技术如XRD、SEM、XPS、TPR-MS和TPD相结合，通过提供关于体相结构、相分离、可还原性、氧脱附行为和表面组成的信息，为掺杂催化剂的全面表征做出贡献。虽然文献没有提供Ce掺杂CoCr2O4的具体拉曼光谱特征，但它表明拉曼光谱与XRD一起用于确定催化剂的体相结构。这种多技术方法允许对催化剂的组成、结构和潜在的原位行为有更完整的理解。这些方法的组合提供了关于掺杂如何影响催化剂性质的见解，如可还原性和氧移动性，这些对甲烷燃烧的催化性能至关重要。
