[1] "Characterization studies by X-ray diffraction (XRD), Raman spectroscopy, BET, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), temperature-programmed reduction mass spectroscopy (CH4 TPR-MS) and temperature-programmed desorption of oxygen (O2-TPD) were carried out."

[2] "The bulk structure was determined by Raman and XRD and the phase segregation was studied by SEM. The reducibility was studied by CH4 TPR-MS. The oxygen desorption behavior was studied by O2-TPD. The chemical states and surface composition has been analyzed using XPS."

The literature does not provide specific information about how Raman spectroscopy contributes to the characterization of Ce-doped CoCr2O4 catalysts or alkali-doped vanadia on titania. It only mentions that Raman spectroscopy was used alongside other techniques to characterize the catalysts, particularly for determining bulk structure. The document does not discuss the relationship between spectral features and catalyst properties like reducibility. More detailed information about the use of Raman spectroscopy and its specific insights is not provided in this text.

该文献没有提供关于拉曼光谱如何具体贡献于Ce掺杂CoCr2O4催化剂或钛酸钒上碱金属掺杂催化剂表征的信息。它只提到拉曼光谱与其他技术一起用于表征催化剂,特别是用于确定体相结构。文档中没有讨论光谱特征与催化剂性质(如可还原性)之间的关系。本文中没有提供关于拉曼光谱使用及其具体见解的更详细信息。
