          [1] "Characterization studies by X-ray diffraction (XRD), Raman spectroscopy, BET, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), temperature-programmed reduction mass spectroscopy (CH4 TPR-MS) and temperature-programmed desorption of oxygen (O2-TPD) were carried out."

          [2] "The bulk structure was determined by Raman and XRD and the phase segregation was studied by SEM. The reducibility was studied by CH4 TPR-MS. The oxygen desorption behavior was studied by O2-TPD. The chemical states and surface composition has been analyzed using XPS."

          Raman spectroscopy, in combination with other analytical techniques like XRD, SEM, XPS, TPR-MS, and O2-TPD, contributes to a comprehensive characterization of doped catalysts by providing information on their bulk structure, phase composition, reducibility, oxygen desorption behavior, and surface chemical states. Specifically for Ce-doped CoCr2O4 catalysts, Raman spectroscopy is used alongside XRD to determine the bulk structure. While the literature does not provide specific details about Raman spectral features and their relationship to catalyst properties for Ce-doped CoCr2O4 or alkali-doped vanadia on titania, the combination of these techniques allows for a thorough understanding of the catalyst's composition, structure, and reactivity. This multi-technique approach enables researchers to potentially correlate spectral features with various catalyst properties, providing insights into how doping affects the spinel structure, metal ion distribution, oxygen mobility, and overall catalytic performance in processes such as methane combustion.

          拉曼光谱与其他分析技术（如XRD、SEM、XPS、TPR-MS和O2-TPD）相结合，通过提供关于掺杂催化剂的体相结构、相组成、可还原性、氧脱附行为和表面化学态的信息，为其全面表征做出贡献。具体对于Ce掺杂CoCr2O4催化剂，拉曼光谱与XRD一起用于确定体相结构。虽然文献没有提供Ce掺杂CoCr2O4或钛载碱金属掺杂钒氧化物的拉曼光谱特征及其与催化剂性质关系的具体细节，但这些技术的组合允许对催化剂的组成、结构和反应性进行全面了解。这种多技术方法使研究人员能够潜在地将光谱特征与各种催化剂性质相关联，提供关于掺杂如何影响尖晶石结构、金属离子分布、氧移动性以及在甲烷燃烧等过程中的整体催化性能的见解。
