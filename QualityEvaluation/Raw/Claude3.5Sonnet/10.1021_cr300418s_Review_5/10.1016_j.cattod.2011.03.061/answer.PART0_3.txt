[1] "Characterization studies by X-ray diffraction (XRD), Raman spectroscopy, BET, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), temperature-programmed reduction mass spectroscopy (CH4 TPR-MS) and temperature-programmed desorption of oxygen (O2-TPD) were carried out."

[2] "The bulk structure was determined by Raman and XRD and the phase segregation was studied by SEM. The reducibility was studied by CH4 TPR-MS. The oxygen desorption behavior was studied by O2-TPD. The chemical states and surface composition has been analyzed using XPS."

Raman spectroscopy, in combination with other analytical techniques like XRD, SEM, XPS, CH4 TPR-MS, and O2-TPD, contributes to a comprehensive characterization of doped catalysts such as Ce-doped CoCr2O4. These techniques together provide insights into the catalyst's composition, structure, and reactivity. Specifically, Raman and XRD are used to determine the bulk structure, while SEM studies phase segregation. CH4 TPR-MS investigates reducibility, and O2-TPD examines oxygen desorption behavior. XPS analyzes chemical states and surface composition. This multi-technique approach allows for a thorough understanding of the relationship between spectral features and catalyst properties, although the provided literature does not offer specific details about Raman spectral features or their correlation with catalyst properties for Ce-doped CoCr2O4 or alkali-doped vanadia on titania.

拉曼光谱与其他分析技术如XRD、SEM、XPS、CH4 TPR-MS和O2-TPD相结合，为掺杂催化剂（如Ce掺杂CoCr2O4）的综合表征做出了贡献。这些技术共同提供了关于催化剂组成、结构和反应性的见解。具体而言，拉曼和XRD用于确定体相结构，而SEM研究相分离。CH4 TPR-MS调查还原性，O2-TPD考察氧脱附行为。XPS分析化学态和表面组成。这种多技术方法允许全面理解光谱特征与催化剂性质之间的关系，尽管所提供的文献并未提供Ce掺杂CoCr2O4或碱金属掺杂的钛载钒氧化物的拉曼光谱特征或其与催化剂性质相关性的具体细节。
