[1] "Characterization studies by X-ray diffraction (XRD), Raman spectroscopy, BET, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), temperature-programmed reduction mass spectroscopy (CH4 TPR-MS) and temperature-programmed desorption of oxygen (O2-TPD) were carried out."

[2] "The bulk structure was determined by Raman and XRD and the phase segregation was studied by SEM. The reducibility was studied by CH4 TPR-MS. The oxygen desorption behavior was studied by O2-TPD. The chemical states and surface composition has been analyzed using XPS."

Raman spectroscopy, in combination with other analytical techniques like XRD, SEM, XPS, TPR-MS, and TPD, contributes to a comprehensive characterization of doped catalysts by providing information on bulk structure, phase segregation, reducibility, oxygen desorption behavior, and chemical states. In the case of Ce-doped CoCr2O4 catalysts, these techniques collectively offer insights into the composition, structure, and reactivity of the catalysts. While the literature does not provide specific details on the relationship between Raman spectral features and catalyst properties like reducibility, it suggests that the combination of these techniques allows for a thorough understanding of the catalyst's characteristics and behavior under various conditions.

拉曼光谱与其他分析技术（如XRD、SEM、XPS、TPR-MS和TPD）结合使用，通过提供有关体相结构、相分离、可还原性、氧脱附行为和化学状态的信息，为掺杂催化剂的综合表征做出贡献。在Ce掺杂CoCr2O4催化剂的案例中，这些技术共同为催化剂的组成、结构和反应性提供了深入了解。虽然文献中没有具体说明拉曼光谱特征与催化剂性能（如可还原性）之间的关系，但它表明这些技术的组合允许我们全面理解催化剂在各种条件下的特性和行为。
