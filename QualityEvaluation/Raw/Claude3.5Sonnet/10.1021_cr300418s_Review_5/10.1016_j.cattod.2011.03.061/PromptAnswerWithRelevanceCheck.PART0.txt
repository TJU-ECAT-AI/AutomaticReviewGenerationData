Raman spectroscopy, in combination with other analytical techniques like XRD, SEM, XPS, TPR-MS, and TPD, contributes to a comprehensive characterization of doped catalysts by providing information on bulk structure, phase segregation, reducibility, oxygen desorption behavior, and chemical states. In the case of Ce-doped CoCr2O4 catalysts, these techniques collectively offer insights into the composition, structure, and reactivity of the catalysts. While the literature does not provide specific details on the relationship between Raman spectral features and catalyst properties like reducibility, it suggests that the combination of these techniques allows for a thorough understanding of the catalyst's characteristics and behavior under various conditions.

Raman spectroscopy, in combination with other analytical techniques like XRD, SEM, XPS, TPR-MS, and TPD, contributes to a comprehensive characterization of doped catalysts by providing information on bulk structure, phase segregation, reducibility, oxygen desorption behavior, and surface composition. While the literature does not provide specific details on Raman spectral features for Ce-doped CoCr2O4, it indicates that Raman spectroscopy is used alongside XRD to determine the bulk structure of the catalysts. This multi-technique approach allows for a more complete understanding of the catalyst's composition, structure, and potential in situ behavior. The combination of these methods provides insights into how doping affects the catalyst's properties, such as reducibility and oxygen mobility, which are crucial for catalytic performance in methane combustion.
