Raman spectroscopy, when used in combination with other analytical techniques, contributes significantly to the comprehensive characterization and understanding of doped catalysts. It helps identify vibrations associated with both pure phase materials and doped chromites, allowing for composition and structural analysis. In situ Raman measurements under reaction conditions, combined with catalyst reactivity characterizations, provide insights into the behavior of catalysts during reactions. This approach has been used to evaluate the effect of alkali doping on the reducibility of vanadia supported on titania. The studies revealed a correlation between the reducibility of vanadia and the Raman spectrum of the vanadyl group, demonstrating how spectral features can be linked to important catalyst properties. These applications of Raman spectroscopy, exemplified by studies on Ce-doped CoCr2O4 and alkali-doped vanadia on titania, showcase its ability to provide valuable insights into catalyst composition, structure, in situ behavior, and reactivity.
