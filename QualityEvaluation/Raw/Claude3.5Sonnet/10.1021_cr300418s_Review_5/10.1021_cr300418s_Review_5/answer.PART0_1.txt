[1] "In studies of Ce-doped CoCr2O4 catalyst for methane oxidation, Cr was substituted by Ce from 2% to 100%, and the material was characterized by Raman, XRD, and XPS. XRD suggested that a single phase solid solution was produced up to 10% substitution. Raman spectra were used to identify vibrations associated with pure phase materials and with the doped chromite."

[2] "In situ measurements of Raman spectra under reaction conditions were combined with catalyst reactivity characterizations to evaluate the effect of alkali doping on the reducibility of vanadia supported on titania. It was found that reducibility of the vanadia correlates with the Raman spectrum of the vanadyl group."

Raman spectroscopy, when used in combination with other analytical techniques such as XRD and XPS, contributes significantly to the comprehensive characterization and understanding of doped catalysts. In the case of Ce-doped CoCr2O4 catalysts for methane oxidation, Raman spectroscopy was used to identify vibrations associated with both pure phase materials and the doped chromite. This information, combined with XRD data showing single-phase solid solution formation up to 10% substitution, provides insights into the composition and structure of the doped catalyst.

Furthermore, in situ Raman spectroscopy under reaction conditions, when combined with catalyst reactivity characterizations, offers valuable insights into the behavior of doped catalysts during operation. This approach was used to study the effect of alkali doping on vanadia supported on titania. The study revealed a correlation between the reducibility of vanadia and the Raman spectrum of the vanadyl group, demonstrating how Raman spectroscopy can provide information about key catalyst properties such as reducibility.

These examples illustrate how Raman spectroscopy, especially when used in conjunction with other techniques and under in situ conditions, can provide a more complete understanding of doped catalysts' composition, structure, and behavior during reactions. This comprehensive approach allows researchers to establish relationships between spectral features and important catalyst properties, ultimately leading to better design and optimization of catalytic materials.

拉曼光谱法与其他分析技术（如XRD和XPS）结合使用时，对掺杂催化剂的全面表征和理解做出了重要贡献。以用于甲烷氧化的铈掺杂CoCr2O4催化剂为例，拉曼光谱被用来识别与纯相材料和掺杂的铬酸盐相关的振动。这一信息与XRD数据（显示在10%替代率以下形成单相固溶体）相结合，为掺杂催化剂的成分和结构提供了深入的见解。

此外，在反应条件下进行的原位拉曼光谱测量，结合催化剂反应性表征，可以为掺杂催化剂在运行过程中的行为提供宝贵的见解。这种方法被用于研究碱金属掺杂对钛载钒氧化物的影响。研究发现钒氧化物的可还原性与钒酰基的拉曼光谱相关，展示了拉曼光谱如何能够提供关于催化剂关键性质（如可还原性）的信息。

这些例子说明了拉曼光谱，特别是当与其他技术结合使用并在原位条件下使用时，如何能够对掺杂催化剂的成分、结构和反应过程中的行为提供更全面的理解。这种综合方法使研究人员能够建立光谱特征与重要催化剂性质之间的关系，最终导致更好的催化材料设计和优化。
