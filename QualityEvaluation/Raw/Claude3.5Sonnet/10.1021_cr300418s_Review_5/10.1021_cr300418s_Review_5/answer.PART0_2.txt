Raman spectroscopy, when combined with other analytical techniques, contributes significantly to the comprehensive characterization and understanding of doped catalysts. It provides valuable insights into the composition and structure of catalysts by identifying vibrations associated with both pure phase materials and doped compounds. For example, in studies of Ce-doped CoCr2O4 catalysts, Raman spectroscopy was used alongside XRD and XPS to characterize the material's structure and composition.

Furthermore, Raman spectroscopy enables in situ measurements under reaction conditions, allowing researchers to observe changes in the catalyst's structure and behavior during catalytic processes. This capability is particularly useful when combined with catalyst reactivity characterizations, as demonstrated in the study of alkali-doped vanadia supported on titania. 

The technique also provides insights into the relationship between spectral features and catalyst properties. In the case of vanadia catalysts, it was found that the reducibility of the vanadia correlates with the Raman spectrum of the vanadyl group. This correlation demonstrates how Raman spectroscopy can be used to predict or understand important catalyst properties, such as reducibility, which are crucial for catalytic performance.

Overall, Raman spectroscopy, especially when used in conjunction with other analytical methods, offers a powerful tool for investigating the structure, composition, and behavior of doped catalysts under various conditions, providing valuable information for catalyst design and optimization.

拉曼光谱与其他分析技术结合使用时，对掺杂催化剂的全面表征和理解做出了重要贡献。它通过识别与纯相材料和掺杂化合物相关的振动，提供了催化剂成分和结构的宝贵信息。例如，在研究铈掺杂的CoCr2O4催化剂时，拉曼光谱与XRD和XPS一起用于表征材料的结构和成分。

此外，拉曼光谱能够在反应条件下进行原位测量，使研究人员能够观察催化过程中催化剂结构和行为的变化。这种能力在与催化剂反应性表征相结合时特别有用，正如在研究钛载碱金属掺杂钒氧化物的研究中所展示的那样。

该技术还提供了光谱特征与催化剂性能之间关系的见解。在钒氧化物催化剂的案例中，发现钒的可还原性与钒酰基的拉曼光谱相关。这种相关性表明拉曼光谱可以用来预测或理解重要的催化剂性质，如可还原性，这对催化性能至关重要。

总的来说，拉曼光谱，尤其是与其他分析方法结合使用时，为研究各种条件下掺杂催化剂的结构、成分和行为提供了强大的工具，为催化剂设计和优化提供了宝贵的信息。
