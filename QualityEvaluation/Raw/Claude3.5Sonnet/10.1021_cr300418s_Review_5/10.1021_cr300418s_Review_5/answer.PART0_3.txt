[1] "In studies of Ce-doped CoCr2O4 catalyst for methane oxidation, Cr was substituted by Ce from 2% to 100%, and the material was characterized by Raman, XRD, and XPS. XRD suggested that a single phase solid solution was produced up to 10% substitution. Raman spectra were used to identify vibrations associated with pure phase materials and with the doped chromite."

[2] "In situ measurements of Raman spectra under reaction conditions were combined with catalyst reactivity characterizations to evaluate the effect of alkali doping on the reducibility of vanadia supported on titania. It was found that reducibility of the vanadia correlates with the Raman spectrum of the vanadyl group."

Raman spectroscopy, when used in combination with other analytical techniques like XRD and XPS, contributes significantly to the comprehensive characterization and understanding of doped catalysts. In the case of Ce-doped CoCr2O4 catalysts for methane oxidation, Raman spectroscopy was used alongside XRD and XPS to characterize the material composition and structure. While XRD provided information about phase composition, Raman spectra were specifically employed to identify vibrations associated with both pure phase materials and the doped chromite, offering insights into the molecular structure and bonding of the catalyst.

Furthermore, Raman spectroscopy's capability for in situ measurements under reaction conditions makes it particularly valuable for understanding catalyst behavior during operation. This was demonstrated in studies of alkali-doped vanadia supported on titania, where in situ Raman measurements were combined with catalyst reactivity characterizations. This approach revealed a correlation between the reducibility of vanadia and the Raman spectrum of the vanadyl group, providing crucial insights into the relationship between spectral features and catalyst properties.

These examples highlight how Raman spectroscopy, especially when used in conjunction with other techniques and under in situ conditions, can provide detailed information about catalyst composition, structure, and behavior during reactions. This comprehensive approach allows researchers to gain a deeper understanding of how dopants affect catalyst properties and performance, ultimately contributing to the development of more effective catalytic materials.

拉曼光谱法与其他分析技术（如XRD和XPS）结合使用时，对掺杂催化剂的全面表征和理解做出了重要贡献。以用于甲烷氧化的铈掺杂CoCr2O4催化剂为例，拉曼光谱与XRD和XPS一起用于表征材料的组成和结构。XRD提供了相组成信息，而拉曼光谱则专门用于识别与纯相材料和掺杂铬酸盐相关的振动，从而提供了催化剂分子结构和键合的信息。

此外，拉曼光谱在反应条件下进行原位测量的能力使其在理解催化剂运行过程中的行为方面特别有价值。这一点在钛载碱金属掺杂钒氧化物的研究中得到了证明，其中原位拉曼测量与催化剂反应性表征相结合。这种方法揭示了钒氧化物的可还原性与钒酰基团的拉曼光谱之间的相关性，为理解光谱特征与催化剂性能之间的关系提供了关键见解。

这些例子突出显示了拉曼光谱，尤其是当与其他技术结合使用并在原位条件下使用时，如何能提供关于催化剂组成、结构和反应过程中行为的详细信息。这种综合方法使研究人员能够深入了解掺杂剂如何影响催化剂的性能和特性，最终有助于开发更有效的催化材料。
