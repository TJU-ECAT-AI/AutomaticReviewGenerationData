Composition and Structure: Raman spectroscopy reveals the presence of specific structural features, such as the terminal vanadyl group (V=O) identified by the Raman band at 1020 cm-1. It also shows how the addition of alkali promoters affects the catalyst structure, particularly through the observed red shift in the V=O vibration frequency, indicating a weakening of the V=O bond.\n\n2.
