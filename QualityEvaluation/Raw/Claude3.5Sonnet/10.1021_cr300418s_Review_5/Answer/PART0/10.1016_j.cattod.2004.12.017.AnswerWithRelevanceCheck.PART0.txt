          [1] "Among all the available spectroscopic techniques, Raman spectroscopy is particularly suited for in situ studies since there is negligible interference from the gas phase due to the weak light scattering from the low density of molecules in the gas or vapor phase."

[2] "Combination of UVvis-DRS and Raman spectroscopy, however, provide better understanding of oxidation states of supported vanadium oxide catalysts at different surface coverage, on different oxide supports and with different hydrocarbons"

[3] "The combined use of IR and Raman also provides information about the nature of chemisorbed species and the catalytic active sites during reaction conditions [102,104] and under operando conditions [30]."

[4] "Thus, the combined use of several complementary techniques affords more detailed electronic and molecular structural insights into the nature of surface catalytic active sites as well as surface reaction intermediates and their adsorption sites on the catalyst."

[5] "Combined Raman and UVvis-DRS also allows for correction of Raman signal intensity as well as information on the oxidation states of supported oxide catalysts during non-oxidative dehydrogenation conditions"

          Raman spectroscopy, in combination with other analytical techniques, significantly contributes to the comprehensive characterization and understanding of doped catalysts in several ways:

1. In-situ studies: Raman spectroscopy is particularly well-suited for in-situ studies due to minimal interference from gas phase molecules, allowing for real-time observation of catalyst behavior under reaction conditions.

2. Oxidation state analysis: The combination of UV-vis Diffuse Reflectance Spectroscopy (DRS) and Raman spectroscopy provides insights into the oxidation states of supported catalysts, such as vanadium oxide, at different surface coverages, on various oxide supports, and with different hydrocarbons. This combination also allows for correction of Raman signal intensity and provides information on oxidation states during non-oxidative dehydrogenation conditions.

3. Surface species identification: The combined use of IR and Raman spectroscopy offers information about chemisorbed species and catalytic active sites during reaction conditions, including under operando conditions.

4. Structural insights: The use of multiple complementary techniques, including Raman spectroscopy, provides more detailed electronic and molecular structural insights into the nature of surface catalytic active sites, as well as surface reaction intermediates and their adsorption sites on the catalyst.

While the literature does not specifically mention Ce-doped CoCr2O4 or alkali-doped vanadia on titania, the principles discussed can be applied to these systems. The combined spectroscopic approach would likely provide valuable insights into the composition, structure, and reactivity of these doped catalysts, including information about their reducibility and the relationship between their spectral features and catalytic properties.

          拉曼光谱与其他分析技术结合，在多个方面为掺杂催化剂的综合表征和理解做出了重要贡献：

1. 原位研究：由于气相分子的干扰最小，拉曼特别适合进行原位研究，允许在反应条件下实时观察催化剂行为。

2. 氧化态分析：紫外-可见漫反射光谱（DRS）与拉曼光谱的结合可以揭示负载型催化剂（如钒氧化物）在不同表面覆盖度、不同氧化物载体和各种烃类条件下的氧化态。这种组合还允许校正拉曼信号强度，并提供非氧化脱氢条件下的氧化态信息。

3. 表面物种识别：红外和拉曼光谱的结合可以提供关于反应过程中（包括操作条件下）化学吸附物种和催化活性位点的信息。

4. 结构洞察：使用多种互补技术，包括拉曼光谱，可以提供更详细的表面催化活性位点的电子和分子结构洞察，以及表面反应中间体及其在催化剂上的吸附位点。

虽然文献没有特别提到Ce掺杂的CoCr2O4或钛载碱金属掺杂的钒氧化物，但所讨论的原理可以应用于这些体系。组合光谱方法很可能会为这些掺杂催化剂的组成、结构和反应性提供有价值的见解，包括关于它们的可还原性以及它们的光谱特征与催化性能之间关系的信息。
