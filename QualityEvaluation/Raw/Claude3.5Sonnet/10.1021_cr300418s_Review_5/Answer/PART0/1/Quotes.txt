[1] "Characterization studies by X-ray diffraction (XRD), Raman spectroscopy, BET, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), temperature-programmed reduction mass spectroscopy (CH4 TPR-MS) and temperature-programmed desorption of oxygen (O2-TPD) were carried out."

          [2] "The bulk structure was determined by Raman and XRD and the phase segregation was studied by SEM. The reducibility was studied by CH4 TPR-MS. The oxygen desorption behavior was studied by O2-TPD. The chemical states and surface composition has been analyzed using XPS."

[1] "The Raman spectra of alkali-free and titania-supported vanadium oxide species are shown in Fig. 2. The Raman band at 1020 cm1 corresponds to the vibration of the terminal vanadyl group (V
O). The addition of the alkali promoters to the catalysts induces mainly a red shift of the vibration frequency related to V
O bond."

[2] "The presence of the Li ion decreases the reducibility of dispersed vanadium oxide species compared to the undoped system. The reduction becomes more difficult with the period of the alkali atom in the periodic table. Hence, the sequence of the experimental reducibility, undoped >Li > Na > K, agrees with the predicted modeling tendency of the reactivity of titania-supported vanadium oxide catalysts."

[3] "The present work aims to provide a molecular description of the structure and reactivity of the vanadium oxide catalysts supported on titanium oxide and the importance of alkali doping on their structure and reactivity by a combined theoretical and experimental studies. The surface features have been determined by complementary studies of theoretical modeling (DFT) and experimental in situ Raman spectroscopy and temperature-programmed reduction (TPR)."

[4] "The effect of the alkali metal addition to the vanadia/titania catalysts on the reduction profiles is shown in Fig. 4. All catalysts keep the same V/alkali ion atomic ratio. The presence of the Li ion decreases the reducibility of dispersed vanadium oxide species compared to the undoped system. The reduction becomes more difficult with the period of the alkali atom in the periodic table."

[1] "Among all the available spectroscopic techniques, Raman spectroscopy is particularly suited for in situ studies since there is negligible interference from the gas phase due to the weak light scattering from the low density of molecules in the gas or vapor phase."

[2] "Combination of UVvis-DRS and Raman spectroscopy, however, provide better understanding of oxidation states of supported vanadium oxide catalysts at different surface coverage, on different oxide supports and with different hydrocarbons"

[3] "The combined use of IR and Raman also provides information about the nature of chemisorbed species and the catalytic active sites during reaction conditions [102,104] and under operando conditions [30]."

[4] "Thus, the combined use of several complementary techniques affords more detailed electronic and molecular structural insights into the nature of surface catalytic active sites as well as surface reaction intermediates and their adsorption sites on the catalyst."

[5] "Combined Raman and UVvis-DRS also allows for correction of Raman signal intensity as well as information on the oxidation states of supported oxide catalysts during non-oxidative dehydrogenation conditions"

[1] "Raman spectra were used to identify vibrations associated with pure phase materials and with the doped chromite."

[2] "In situ measurements of Raman spectra under reaction conditions were combined with catalyst reactivity characterizations to evaluate the effect of alkali doping on the reducibility of vanadia supported on titania."

[3] "It was found that reducibility of the vanadia correlates with the Raman spectrum of the vanadyl group."

[4] "In studies of Ce-doped CoCr2O4 catalyst for methane oxidation, Cr was substituted by Ce from 2% to 100%, and the material was characterized by Raman, XRD, and XPS. XRD suggested that a single phase solid solution was produced up to 10% substitution."
