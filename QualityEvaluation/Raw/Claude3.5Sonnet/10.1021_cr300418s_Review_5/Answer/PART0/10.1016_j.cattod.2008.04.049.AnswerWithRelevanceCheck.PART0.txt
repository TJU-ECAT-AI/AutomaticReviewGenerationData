          [1] "The Raman spectra of alkali-free and titania-supported vanadium oxide species are shown in Fig. 2. The Raman band at 1020 cm1 corresponds to the vibration of the terminal vanadyl group (V
O). The addition of the alkali promoters to the catalysts induces mainly a red shift of the vibration frequency related to V
O bond."

[2] "The presence of the Li ion decreases the reducibility of dispersed vanadium oxide species compared to the undoped system. The reduction becomes more difficult with the period of the alkali atom in the periodic table. Hence, the sequence of the experimental reducibility, undoped >Li > Na > K, agrees with the predicted modeling tendency of the reactivity of titania-supported vanadium oxide catalysts."

[3] "The present work aims to provide a molecular description of the structure and reactivity of the vanadium oxide catalysts supported on titanium oxide and the importance of alkali doping on their structure and reactivity by a combined theoretical and experimental studies. The surface features have been determined by complementary studies of theoretical modeling (DFT) and experimental in situ Raman spectroscopy and temperature-programmed reduction (TPR)."

[4] "The effect of the alkali metal addition to the vanadia/titania catalysts on the reduction profiles is shown in Fig. 4. All catalysts keep the same V/alkali ion atomic ratio. The presence of the Li ion decreases the reducibility of dispersed vanadium oxide species compared to the undoped system. The reduction becomes more difficult with the period of the alkali atom in the periodic table."

          Raman spectroscopy, in combination with other analytical techniques such as temperature-programmed reduction (TPR) and theoretical modeling (DFT), contributes significantly to the comprehensive characterization and understanding of doped catalysts, particularly in terms of their composition, structure, in situ behavior, and reactivity. In the case of alkali-doped vanadia on titania catalysts, this multi-technique approach provides several key insights:

1. Composition and Structure: Raman spectroscopy reveals the presence of specific structural features, such as the terminal vanadyl group (V=O) identified by the Raman band at 1020 cm-1. It also shows how the addition of alkali promoters affects the catalyst structure, particularly through the observed red shift in the V=O vibration frequency, indicating a weakening of the V=O bond.

2. In Situ Behavior: The use of in situ Raman spectroscopy allows for the observation of catalysts under reaction-like conditions, providing insights into structural changes that occur during catalytic processes.

3. Reactivity: The combination of Raman spectroscopy with TPR provides a correlation between spectral features and catalyst reactivity. The observed red shift in the V=O vibration frequency corresponds to changes in the catalyst's reducibility, as confirmed by TPR studies.

4. Structure-Property Relationships: By correlating Raman spectral features with TPR results, researchers can establish relationships between the catalyst's structure and its properties. For instance, the study demonstrates that the reducibility of the vanadium oxide species decreases in the order of undoped > Li > Na > K, which is consistent with both the Raman spectral shifts and the TPR results.

5. Validation of Theoretical Models: The experimental results from Raman spectroscopy and TPR validate and complement the predictions from theoretical modeling (DFT), enhancing the overall understanding of the catalyst system.

This comprehensive approach provides valuable insights into the effects of doping on catalyst properties and performance, demonstrating how spectral features can be related to important catalyst characteristics such as reducibility. While the study focuses on alkali-doped vanadia on titania, similar approaches can be applied to other doped catalyst systems, including Ce-doped CoCr2O4, to gain insights into their composition, structure, and reactivity.

          拉曼光谱与其他分析技术（如程序升温还原（TPR）和理论建模（DFT））相结合，为掺杂催化剂的全面表征和理解做出了重要贡献，特别是在组成、结构、原位行为和反应性方面。对于碱金属掺杂的钛载钒氧化物催化剂，这种多技术方法提供了几个关键见解：

1. 组成和结构：拉曼光谱揭示了特定结构特征的存在，如通过1020 cm-1处的拉曼带识别的端基钒酰基团（V=O）。它还显示了碱金属助剂的添加如何影响催化剂结构，特别是通过观察到的V=O振动频率红移，表明V=O键减弱。

2. 原位行为：使用原位拉曼光谱可以在类反应条件下观察催化剂，提供了关于催化过程中结构变化的见解。

3. 反应性：将拉曼光谱与TPR相结合，提供了光谱特征与催化剂反应性之间的相关性。观察到的V=O振动频率红移对应于催化剂可还原性的变化，这通过TPR研究得到了证实。

4. 结构-性能关系：通过将拉曼光谱特征与TPR结果相关联，研究人员可以建立催化剂结构与其性能之间的关系。例如，研究表明钒氧化物物种的可还原性按未掺杂 > Li > Na > K的顺序降低，这与拉曼光谱位移和TPR结果一致。

5. 理论模型的验证：来自拉曼光谱和TPR的实验结果验证和补充了理论建模（DFT）的预测，增强了对催化剂系统的整体理解。

这种综合方法为掺杂对催化剂性质和性能的影响提供了宝贵的见解，展示了如何将光谱特征与重要的催化剂特性（如可还原性）联系起来。虽然该研究集中在钛载碱金属掺杂钒氧化物上，但类似的方法可以应用于其他掺杂催化剂系统，包括铈掺杂的CoCr2O4，以获得关于它们的组成、结构和反应性的见解。
