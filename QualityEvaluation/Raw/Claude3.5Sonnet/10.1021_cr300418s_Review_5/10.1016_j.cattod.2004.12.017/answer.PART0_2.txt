[1] "Raman spectroscopy is particularly suited for in situ studies since there is negligible interference from the gas phase due to the weak light scattering from the low density of molecules in the gas or vapor phase."

[2] "Combined Raman and UVvis-DRS also allows for correction of Raman signal intensity as well as information on the oxidation states of supported oxide catalysts during non-oxidative dehydrogenation conditions"

[3] "The combined use of IR and Raman also provides information about the nature of chemisorbed species and the catalytic active sites during reaction conditions [102,104] and under operando conditions [30]."

[4] "Thus, the combined use of several complementary techniques affords more detailed electronic and molecular structural insights into the nature of surface catalytic active sites as well as surface reaction intermediates and their adsorption sites on the catalyst."

Raman spectroscopy, when combined with other analytical techniques, contributes significantly to the comprehensive characterization and understanding of doped catalysts. It provides valuable insights into their composition, structure, in situ behavior, and reactivity.

Raman spectroscopy is particularly well-suited for in situ studies due to minimal interference from gas phase molecules. When combined with UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (DRS), it allows for correction of Raman signal intensity and provides information on the oxidation states of supported oxide catalysts during non-oxidative dehydrogenation conditions. This combination can offer insights into the reducibility of catalysts.

The combined use of IR and Raman spectroscopy provides information about the nature of chemisorbed species and catalytic active sites during reaction conditions and under operando conditions. This is particularly useful for understanding the relationship between spectral features and catalyst properties.

Overall, the use of multiple complementary techniques, including Raman spectroscopy, affords more detailed electronic and molecular structural insights into the nature of surface catalytic active sites, as well as surface reaction intermediates and their adsorption sites on the catalyst. This comprehensive approach is crucial for developing a thorough understanding of doped catalysts and their behavior under various conditions.

While the literature does not specifically mention Ce-doped CoCr2O4 or alkali-doped vanadia on titania, the principles discussed would apply to these systems as well. The combined spectroscopic approach would likely provide valuable insights into the composition, structure, and reactivity of these doped catalysts, including information about their reducibility and the relationship between their spectral features and catalytic properties.

拉曼光谱与其他分析技术相结合，对掺杂催化剂的全面表征和理解做出了重大贡献。它为催化剂的组成、结构、原位行为和反应性提供了宝贵的见解。

拉曼光谱特别适合原位研究，因为气相分子的干扰很小。当与紫外-可见漫反射光谱(DRS)结合时，它可以校正拉曼信号强度，并提供非氧化脱氢条件下支持氧化物催化剂的氧化态信息。这种组合可以提供关于催化剂可还原性的见解。

红外和拉曼光谱的结合使用提供了关于反应条件下和操作条件下化学吸附物种和催化活性位点性质的信息。这对于理解光谱特征与催化剂性质之间的关系特别有用。

总的来说，使用多种互补技术，包括拉曼光谱，可以提供更详细的表面催化活性位点的电子和分子结构洞察，以及表面反应中间体及其在催化剂上的吸附位点。这种综合方法对于全面了解掺杂催化剂及其在各种条件下的行为至关重要。

虽然文献中没有特别提到Ce掺杂的CoCr2O4或钛基碱金属掺杂的钒氧化物，但所讨论的原理同样适用于这些系统。组合光谱方法很可能会为这些掺杂催化剂的组成、结构和反应性提供有价值的见解，包括关于它们的可还原性以及它们的光谱特征与催化性能之间关系的信息。
