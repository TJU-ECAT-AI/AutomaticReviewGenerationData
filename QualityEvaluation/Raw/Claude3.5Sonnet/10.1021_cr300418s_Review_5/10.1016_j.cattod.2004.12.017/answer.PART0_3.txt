[1] "Among all the available spectroscopic techniques, Raman spectroscopy is particularly suited for in situ studies since there is negligible interference from the gas phase due to the weak light scattering from the low density of molecules in the gas or vapor phase."

[2] "Combination of UVvis-DRS and Raman spectroscopy, however, provide better understanding of oxidation states of supported vanadium oxide catalysts at different surface coverage, on different oxide supports and with different hydrocarbons"

[3] "The combined use of IR and Raman also provides information about the nature of chemisorbed species and the catalytic active sites during reaction conditions and under operando conditions"

[4] "Thus, the combined use of several complementary techniques affords more detailed electronic and molecular structural insights into the nature of surface catalytic active sites as well as surface reaction intermediates and their adsorption sites on the catalyst."

Raman spectroscopy, when combined with other analytical techniques, significantly contributes to the comprehensive characterization and understanding of doped catalysts. It is particularly well-suited for in situ studies due to minimal interference from gas phase molecules. When used in conjunction with UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (DRS), it provides insights into the oxidation states of supported catalysts, such as vanadium oxide, at different surface coverages and on various oxide supports. The combination of Raman with infrared (IR) spectroscopy allows for the investigation of chemisorbed species and catalytic active sites under reaction conditions.

While the literature does not specifically mention Ce-doped CoCr2O4 or alkali-doped vanadia on titania, it emphasizes that using multiple complementary techniques provides more detailed electronic and molecular structural insights into surface catalytic active sites, reaction intermediates, and their adsorption sites. This approach would be applicable to studying the relationship between spectral features and catalyst properties like reducibility in these systems.

The operando methodology, which combines spectroscopic measurements with simultaneous online measurement of catalytic activity and selectivity, further enhances our understanding of structure-activity relationships under realistic reaction conditions. This approach is particularly valuable for investigating how doping affects catalyst behavior and performance during actual catalytic processes.

拉曼光谱与其他分析技术结合时，对掺杂催化剂的全面表征和理解做出了重大贡献。由于气相分子的干扰很小，它特别适合原位研究。当与紫外-可见漫反射光谱（DRS）结合使用时，它能够深入了解支持型催化剂（如钒氧化物）在不同表面覆盖度和各种氧化物载体上的氧化态。拉曼与红外（IR）光谱的组合允许在反应条件下研究化学吸附物种和催化活性位点。

虽然文献没有具体提到掺铈的CoCr2O4或掺碱金属的二氧化钛负载钒氧化物，但它强调使用多种互补技术可以提供关于表面催化活性位点、反应中间体及其吸附位点更详细的电子和分子结构信息。这种方法适用于研究这些系统中光谱特征与催化剂性质（如可还原性）之间的关系。

操作中（operando）方法将光谱测量与催化活性和选择性的同步在线测量相结合，进一步增进了我们对实际反应条件下结构-活性关系的理解。这种方法对于研究掺杂如何影响催化剂在实际催化过程中的行为和性能特别有价值。
