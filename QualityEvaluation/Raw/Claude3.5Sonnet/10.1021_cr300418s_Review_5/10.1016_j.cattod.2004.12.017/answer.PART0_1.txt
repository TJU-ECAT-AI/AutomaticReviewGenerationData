[1] "Among all the available spectroscopic techniques, Raman spectroscopy is particularly suited for in situ studies since there is negligible interference from the gas phase due to the weak light scattering from the low density of molecules in the gas or vapor phase."

[2] "Raman spectroscopy is particularly suited to study supported oxides since most oxides employed as support materials are not Raman active (Al2O3), give rise to only very weak Raman bands (SiO2) or do not exhibit intense Raman bands above 700 cm1 (e.g., ZrO2, TiO2, Nb2O5, Ta2O5, SnO2, Fe2O3, etc.) that can interfere with the most informative Raman modes for the supported oxide catalysts"

[3] "Combination of UVvis-DRS and Raman spectroscopy, however, provide better understanding of oxidation states of supported vanadium oxide catalysts at different surface coverage, on different oxide supports and with different hydrocarbons"

[4] "The combined use of IR and Raman also provides information about the nature of chemisorbed species and the catalytic active sites during reaction conditions"

Raman spectroscopy, in combination with other analytical techniques, contributes significantly to the comprehensive characterization and understanding of doped catalysts in several ways:

1. In situ studies: Raman is particularly well-suited for in situ studies due to minimal interference from gas phase molecules, allowing for real-time observation of catalysts under reaction conditions.

2. Supported oxide characterization: Raman is effective for studying supported oxides because many common support materials have weak or no Raman signals that would interfere with the signals from the supported catalyst.

3. Oxidation state analysis: When combined with UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (DRS), Raman provides insights into the oxidation states of supported catalysts, such as vanadium oxide, at various surface coverages and on different supports.

4. Surface species identification: The combination of IR and Raman spectroscopy offers information about chemisorbed species and active sites on the catalyst surface during reactions.

5. Structural changes: Raman can detect structural modifications in catalysts during reactions, helping to establish structure-activity relationships.

While the provided literature does not specifically mention Ce-doped CoCr2O4 or alkali-doped vanadia on titania, the principles discussed can be applied to these systems. Raman spectroscopy, along with complementary techniques, can provide insights into the composition, structure, and in situ behavior of these doped catalysts. By correlating spectral features with catalyst properties like reducibility, researchers can gain a deeper understanding of how dopants affect catalyst performance and reactivity.

拉曼光谱与其他分析技术结合，在多个方面为掺杂催化剂的综合表征和理解做出了重要贡献：

1. 原位研究：由于气相分子的干扰最小，拉曼特别适合进行原位研究，允许在反应条件下实时观察催化剂。

2. 负载氧化物表征：拉曼对于研究负载氧化物非常有效，因为许多常见的载体材料具有微弱或无拉曼信号，不会干扰负载催化剂的信号。

3. 氧化态分析：当与紫外-可见漫反射光谱（DRS）结合时，拉曼可以提供关于负载催化剂（如钒氧化物）在不同表面覆盖度和不同载体上的氧化态信息。

4. 表面物种识别：红外和拉曼光谱的结合可以提供关于反应过程中催化剂表面化学吸附物种和活性位点的信息。

5. 结构变化：拉曼可以检测反应过程中催化剂的结构变化，有助于建立结构-活性关系。

虽然所提供的文献没有特别提到Ce掺杂的CoCr2O4或钛载碱金属掺杂的钒氧化物，但所讨论的原理可以应用于这些体系。拉曼光谱与其他互补技术一起，可以提供这些掺杂催化剂的组成、结构和原位行为的见解。通过将光谱特征与催化剂的性质（如可还原性）相关联，研究人员可以深入了解掺杂剂如何影响催化剂的性能和反应活性。
