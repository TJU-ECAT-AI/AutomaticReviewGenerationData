[1] "Among all the available spectroscopic techniques, Raman spectroscopy is particularly suited for in situ studies since there is negligible interference from the gas phase due to the weak light scattering from the low density of molecules in the gas or vapor phase."

[2] "Combination of UVvis-DRS and Raman spectroscopy, however, provide better understanding of oxidation states of supported vanadium oxide catalysts at different surface coverage, on different oxide supports and with different hydrocarbons"

[3] "The combined use of IR and Raman also provides information about the nature of chemisorbed species and the catalytic active sites during reaction conditions [102,104] and under operando conditions [30]."

[4] "Thus, the combined use of several complementary techniques affords more detailed electronic and molecular structural insights into the nature of surface catalytic active sites as well as surface reaction intermediates and their adsorption sites on the catalyst."

Raman spectroscopy, when combined with other analytical techniques, contributes significantly to the comprehensive characterization and understanding of doped catalysts. While the given text does not specifically mention Ce-doped CoCr2O4 or alkali-doped vanadia on titania, it does provide insights into how Raman spectroscopy can be used in combination with other techniques to study catalysts.

Raman spectroscopy is particularly well-suited for in situ studies of catalysts due to minimal interference from gas phase molecules. When combined with UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (DRS), it provides a better understanding of oxidation states of supported catalysts, such as vanadium oxide, at different surface coverages and on various oxide supports. This combination can reveal information about the reducibility of the catalyst.

The combination of IR and Raman spectroscopy provides information about chemisorbed species and catalytic active sites during reaction conditions, including under operando conditions. This allows for the study of the relationship between spectral features and catalyst properties during actual reaction conditions.

Overall, the use of multiple complementary spectroscopic techniques, including Raman, offers more detailed insights into the electronic and molecular structures of surface catalytic active sites, as well as surface reaction intermediates and their adsorption sites. While the specific examples of Ce-doped CoCr2O4 and alkali-doped vanadia on titania are not discussed, the principles described could be applied to study the composition, structure, in situ behavior, and reactivity of such doped catalysts.

拉曼光谱与其他分析技术结合使用时，对掺杂催化剂的全面表征和理解做出了重要贡献。虽然给定的文本没有特别提到Ce掺杂的CoCr2O4或钛氧化物上的碱金属掺杂钒氧化物，但它确实提供了关于如何将拉曼光谱与其他技术结合使用来研究催化剂的见解。

拉曼光谱特别适合催化剂的原位研究，因为气相分子的干扰很小。当与紫外-可见漫反射光谱（DRS）结合使用时，它可以更好地理解支持催化剂（如钒氧化物）在不同表面覆盖度和各种氧化物支持物上的氧化态。这种组合可以揭示关于催化剂可还原性的信息。

红外和拉曼光谱的结合提供了关于反应条件下（包括操作条件下）化学吸附物种和催化活性位点的信息。这允许在实际反应条件下研究光谱特征与催化剂性质之间的关系。

总的来说，使用多种互补的光谱技术，包括拉曼光谱，可以对表面催化活性位点的电子和分子结构，以及表面反应中间体及其吸附位点提供更详细的见解。虽然没有讨论Ce掺杂CoCr2O4和钛氧化物上碱金属掺杂钒氧化物的具体例子，但所描述的原理可以应用于研究此类掺杂催化剂的成分、结构、原位行为和反应活性。
