[1] "Raman spectroscopy is particularly suited for in situ studies since there is negligible interference from the gas phase due to the weak light scattering from the low density of molecules in the gas or vapor phase."

[2] "The combined use of IR and Raman also provides information about the nature of chemisorbed species and the catalytic active sites during reaction conditions [102,104] and under operando conditions [30]."

[3] "Combination of UVvis-DRS and Raman spectroscopy, however, provide better understanding of oxidation states of supported vanadium oxide catalysts at different surface coverage, on different oxide supports and with different hydrocarbons [98102]."

[4] "Combined Raman and UVvis-DRS also allows for correction of Raman signal intensity as well as information on the oxidation states of supported oxide catalysts during non-oxidative dehydrogenation conditions [8,103]."

Raman spectroscopy, in combination with other analytical techniques, contributes significantly to the comprehensive characterization and understanding of doped catalysts in several ways:

1. In-situ characterization: Raman spectroscopy is well-suited for in-situ studies due to minimal interference from gas phase molecules, allowing for real-time observation of catalyst behavior under reaction conditions.

2. Structural information: When combined with IR spectroscopy, Raman can provide detailed information about the nature of chemisorbed species and catalytic active sites during reactions, both under standard and operando conditions.

3. Oxidation state analysis: The combination of UV-vis Diffuse Reflectance Spectroscopy (DRS) and Raman spectroscopy offers insights into the oxidation states of supported vanadium oxide catalysts. This is valuable for understanding how surface coverage, different oxide supports, and various hydrocarbons affect the catalyst.

4. Signal correction and redox behavior: Combined Raman and UV-vis DRS allows for correction of Raman signal intensity and provides information on the oxidation states of supported oxide catalysts during non-oxidative dehydrogenation conditions.

While the given text does not specifically mention Ce-doped CoCr2O4 or alkali-doped vanadia on titania, the principles described can be applied to these systems. The combination of spectroscopic techniques can reveal information about the composition, structure, and in-situ behavior of these doped catalysts. The relationship between spectral features and catalyst properties like reducibility can be inferred by observing changes in oxidation states and structural modifications under various reaction conditions.
