[1] "Raman spectroscopy is particularly suited for in situ studies since there is negligible interference from the gas phase due to the weak light scattering from the low density of molecules in the gas or vapor phase."

[2] "The combined use of IR and Raman also provides information about the nature of chemisorbed species and the catalytic active sites during reaction conditions [102,104] and under operando conditions [30]."

[3] "Combination of UVvis-DRS and Raman spectroscopy, however, provide better understanding of oxidation states of supported vanadium oxide catalysts at different surface coverage, on different oxide supports and with different hydrocarbons [98102]."

[4] "Combined Raman and UVvis-DRS also allows for correction of Raman signal intensity as well as information on the oxidation states of supported oxide catalysts during non-oxidative dehydrogenation conditions [8,103]."

Raman spectroscopy, in combination with other analytical techniques, contributes significantly to the comprehensive characterization and understanding of doped catalysts in several ways:

1. In-situ characterization: Raman spectroscopy is well-suited for in-situ studies due to minimal interference from gas phase molecules, allowing for real-time observation of catalyst behavior under reaction conditions.

2. Structural information: When combined with IR spectroscopy, Raman can provide detailed information about the nature of chemisorbed species and catalytic active sites during reactions, both under standard and operando conditions.

3. Oxidation state analysis: The combination of UV-vis Diffuse Reflectance Spectroscopy (DRS) and Raman spectroscopy offers insights into the oxidation states of supported vanadium oxide catalysts. This is valuable for understanding how surface coverage, different oxide supports, and various hydrocarbons affect the catalyst.

4. Signal correction and redox behavior: Combined Raman and UV-vis DRS allows for correction of Raman signal intensity and provides information on the oxidation states of supported oxide catalysts during non-oxidative dehydrogenation conditions.

While the given text does not specifically mention Ce-doped CoCr2O4 or alkali-doped vanadia on titania, the principles described can be applied to these systems. The combination of spectroscopic techniques can reveal information about the composition, structure, and in-situ behavior of these doped catalysts. The relationship between spectral features and catalyst properties like reducibility can be inferred by observing changes in oxidation states and structural modifications under various reaction conditions.

拉曼光谱与其他分析技术相结合，对掺杂催化剂的全面表征和理解做出了重要贡献，具体表现在以下几个方面：

1. 原位表征：由于气相分子的干扰很小，拉曼光谱特别适合进行原位研究，可以实时观察反应条件下催化剂的行为。

2. 结构信息：与红外光谱结合使用时，拉曼光谱可以提供有关反应过程中化学吸附物种和催化活性位点性质的详细信息，既适用于标准条件，也适用于操作条件。

3. 氧化态分析：紫外-可见漫反射光谱（DRS）与拉曼光谱的结合可以揭示负载型钒氧化物催化剂的氧化态。这对于理解表面覆盖度、不同氧化物载体和各种烃类如何影响催化剂非常有价值。

4. 信号校正和氧化还原行为：拉曼和紫外-可见DRS的结合允许对拉曼信号强度进行校正，并提供非氧化脱氢条件下负载氧化物催化剂氧化态的信息。

虽然给定的文本没有特别提到Ce掺杂的CoCr2O4或钛上的碱金属掺杂钒氧化物，但所描述的原理可以应用于这些体系。多种光谱技术的组合可以揭示这些掺杂催化剂的成分、结构和原位行为信息。通过观察不同反应条件下氧化态的变化和结构修饰，可以推断光谱特征与催化剂性质（如可还原性）之间的关系。
