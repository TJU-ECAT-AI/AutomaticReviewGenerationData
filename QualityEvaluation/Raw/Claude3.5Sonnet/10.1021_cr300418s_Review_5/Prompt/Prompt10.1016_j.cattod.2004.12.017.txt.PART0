Abstract
Operando spectroscopy is a methodology that combines the spectroscopic characterization of a catalytic material during reaction with the
simultaneous measurement of catalytic activity/selectivity. Operando spectroscopy is a new term that has been introduced into the catalysis
literature at the beginning of the 21st century that underlines the importance of simultaneously combining fundamental spectroscopic surface
phenomenon with catalytic performance, on the same sample, under realistic reaction conditions. The potential impact of operando
spectroscopy on catalysis science lies in its ability to significantly assist in the establishment of fundamental molecular structureactivity/
selectivity relationships for catalytic systems. It is critical that the design of the spectroscopic reaction cell, the catalytic reactor, also allows
for the generation of catalytic performance data that is analogous to those achieved with conventional catalytic reactors. A case study of
operando Raman-GC study is presented along with consideration of the methodology, spectroscopy and samples.

1. Operando catalytic spectroscopy
Heterogeneous catalysts play a key role in chemical
industry since most products are produced by catalytic
processes. Understanding the structureactivity relation-
ships at the molecular and atomic scale is of significant
importance in assisting the improvement of existing
catalytic processes as well as developing new catalytic
processes. In situ spectroscopic studies have significantly
advanced catalysis science by providing fundamental
information about catalytic structure and surface species
under controlled environments [122]. These developments
have allowed for major advances in catalysis science
towards the rational design of new and efficient catalysts.
The electronic and molecular structures of catalytic active
sites and surface intermediates are currently characterized
by a large collection of spectroscopic techniques. Some-
times under vacuum conditions with model catalytic systems
and in other cases under in situ conditions in the presence of
chemical probe molecules, reactive environments (reduc-
tion, oxidation, etc.) or reaction conditions. These different
scenarios provide fundamental information about the
electronic and molecular structures of the catalytic active
sites and surface intermediates. The surface state of a
catalyst is strongly affected by the environmental conditions
(pressure, temperature, reactants, products, etc.). Under
typical catalytic reaction conditions, the reactants concen-
trate on the solid surface [4,5] and induce changes in the
surface structure. A comparison of the surface of Rh and Pt
in vacuum and at nearly atmospheric pressure by infrared
visible sum frequency generation with simultaneous online
gas chromatographic analysis of the gas phase, an operando
investigation, clearly illustrates the reconstruction of the
surface during catalytic operation that is not observed under
vacuum conditions [4]. Exposure of the heterogeneous
catalyst to adsorbates has been shown to reconstruct many
catalytic surfaces [2,5,1517]. Many surface reaction

intermediates may also not be present far from reaction
conditions (e.g., vacuum). It is also important to underline
that a number of industrial catalytic systems undergo
transient activation or deactivation processes, which may
also be related to surface structural changes. These pressure
and material gaps must be bridged for the development of
structureactivity relationships [122]. Thus, unfortunately,
confusion may arise from attempts to correlate the structure
of a catalyst at conditions that are not relevant to its catalytic
operation (e.g., ambient conditions where the surfaces are
hydrated with moisture and their structures are different than
those under reaction conditions) [1214,2335].
Fundamental structureactivity/selectivity relationships
are critical for the development of knowledge-based design
of new and novel catalytic materials for different applica-
tions. True fundamental understanding of the structure
activity/selectivity relationship requires molecular level
characterization
of
catalytic
materials
under
realistic
catalytic operation conditions [2,3,5,23]. I would now like
briefly digress from catalysis science to etymology. The term
in situ spectroscopy is well established and widely used in
the catalysis literature, but operando spectroscopic meth-
odology has just recently been introduced into the catalysis
literature in 2002 [24,25,34] to express a methodology that
combines simultaneous in situ spectroscopy and kinetic
measurements on the same sample and time. The details of
this Latin term are described elsewhere [23]. Operando is
borrowed
from
Latin,
which
means
working
or
operating since the spectra are of an operating
catalyst, whereas, in situ means on site. Etymologi-
cally, the term in situ has no temporal discrimination and it is
possible to describe several different types of in situ studies:
(a) In situ describes the collection of spectra of a
catalytic sample in the same environment were it has
been treated or pretreated and the temperature may no
longer be that of the pretreatment.
(b) Variable-programmed in situ spectra describes the
spectra monitor the transformations occurring versus a
variable.
For
instance,
during
a
temperature-pro-
grammed process such as TPR-Raman for the reduction
of a sample [2628], TPO-Raman [26,29] during for
oxidation of a sample, or TPSR-Raman to investigate
the surface reactions of adsorbates of chemical probe
molecules [30]. Or in general, any transformation that
may
occur
during
heating
[31,32].
The
in
situ
temperature-programmed Raman (TP-Raman) studies
follow the evolution of a sample under controlled
atmosphere versus temperature. Variable-programmed
in situ studies may follow the materials under many
conditions relevant to catalysis (pressure, temperature,
reactant concentration, etc.) [33].
(c) Reaction in situ refers to in situ spectroscopic
measurement under reaction conditions relevant to
catalytic operation. In this case, the spectra are taken
under conditions relevant to catalytic operation (tran-
sient or steady state). To assess if the spectra actually
correspond to a catalyst at work, it is possible to use
online analysis (e.g., mass spectrometry, chromatogra-
phy or infrared) to confirm that the catalytic material is
actually functioning as a catalyst. However, many in situ
reactor cell designs may not be appropriate for true
catalytic reaction kinetic studies because of complica-
tions from gas phase reaction due to large void volumes
or heat and mass transfer gradients.
(d) Operando methodology describes in situ spectra
under
true
catalytic
operation
as
determined
by
simultaneous online activity/selectivity measurements.
The term operando provides a single word that
underlines the simultaneous evaluation of both structure
(catalytic active sites and surface reaction intermedi-
ates) and catalytic activity/selectivity [2325,34,35].
Among all the available spectroscopic techniques, Ra-
man spectroscopy is particularly suited for in situ studies
since there is negligible interference from the gas phase due
to the weak light scattering from the low density of mole-
cules in the gas or vapor phase. The Raman spectra may be
acquired over a wide range of sample temperature (from at
least liquid He and N2 to 1300 8C) [36,37] and pressure
(vacuum to several atmospheres). Visible excitation (typi-
cally, from 488 to 633 nm) is mostly employed and the
convenient optical arrangements of current Raman systems
allow for the design of environmental catalytic reactor cells
that perform similarly to conventional catalytic reactors
during the operando spectroscopic studies. Therefore, Ra-
man spectra can be collected during catalytic operation to
provide molecular level insight into the structureactivity/
selectivity relationships of catalytic active sites and the a-
ssociated surface intermediates when present.
The activity/selectivity measurement method (e.g., GC,
MS, IR, etc.) should also be contained in the operando
spectroscopy nomenclature. For example, Raman spectra
acquired during catalytic operation with simultaneous
online gas-chromatograph activity measurement should be
referred to as operando Raman-GC. Operando spectro-
scopy may also find application in other technological fields
where environmental (temperature, pressure and atmo-
sphere) spectroscopy will provide fundamental information
about the molecular structure and performance of various
the materials. It needs to be further emphasized that
operando means an action, whereas, in situ means at a
location and, consequently, it is grammatically incorrect to
say in operando.
A growing number of papers have appeared in the
catalysis literature using the term operando since it was
first proposed in 2002 [24,25,34,35]. The ISI Web of Science
has 18 entries for papers employing this term, 16 of the
papers are actually using operando spectroscopic techniques
[24,25,34,35,3851]. Several conferences have already been
organized on operando spectroscopy [5256]. Operando
expresses a concept that has previously been employed by

several catalysis researchers. Most of the available in situ
catalyst spectroscopic techniques have already been used in
the operando mode. It appears that the earliest operando
paper is that reported by Tamaru combining pulses of
reactants to an infrared cell containing catalysts with
simultaneous chromatographic analyses of the products
[57]. Possibly the earliest operando Raman study was
reported by Hill et al. [58]. Several researchers have already
also reported reaction in situ studies with simultaneous
evaluation of activity for other spectroscopic techniques:
SFG-MS [5], EPR-GC [59], XRD [60] or NMR [61]. There
is now clearly a trend in the catalysis literature on the
progress of several in situ spectroscopic characterization
techniques with increasing emphasis on catalytic reaction
conditions. An issue devoted to in situ characterization of
catalysts has recently appeared in Topics in Catalysis, edited
by Thomas and Somorjai [62]. On occasion of this 100th
issue of Catalysis Today, it is interesting that one of the
earliest journal issues devoted to in situ spectroscopy under
reaction conditions was published in a special issue of
Catalysis Today edited by Burch [19]. That issue is a
milestone for the combination of in situ spectroscopy and
kinetic analyses in catalytic science and even includes
several operando papers, however, before the operando
word appeared in the catalysis literature: operando DRIFTS-
MS [63], operando thermography-IR product analyzer and
concentration-programmed experiment [33], operando IR-
GC [64], operando IR-mass spectrometry [65], operando
electrochemistry-chromatography
[66],
and
operando
EXAFS-chromatography [67,68].
2. Considerations about operando experiments
Operando studies provide molecular level information
about the dynamic states of catalytic active sites and about the
surface reaction intermediates during catalytic reactions, with
both structure and activity being simultaneously determined.
In addition, the catalytic activity data determined in the
operando reactor cell should also agree with the correspond-
ing results from conventional reactors. Such data are
presented in Table 1 where conversion and selectivity values
for an alumina-supported molybdena-vanadia catalyst during
propane oxidative-dehydrogenation reaction are compared in
a conventional fixed-bed reactor and in an operando fixed-bed
reactor cell [41]. The excellent agreement for the results from
both reactor types demonstrates that this is indeed a realistic
goal for operando spectroscopy studies. Such considerations
had previously also been achieved by other groups that
combined in situ spectroscopy and online activity/selectivity
measurements [60,6973].
In addition, the selection of the specific catalytic reaction
system and the spectroscopic technique will also have a
major impact on the relevance of the electronic and
molecular structure information that can be obtained with
operando spectroscopy investigations. Supported oxide
catalysts are particularly suited for such studies since the
catalytic active sites are generally 100% dispersed on the
oxide support surface and, therefore, directly exposed to the
reaction environment. Raman spectroscopy is particularly
suited to study supported oxides since most oxides employed
as support materials are not Raman active (Al2O3), give rise
to only very weak Raman bands (SiO2) or do not exhibit
intense Raman bands above 700 cm1 (e.g., ZrO2, TiO2,
Nb2O5, Ta2O5, SnO2, Fe2O3, etc.) that can interfere with the
most informative Raman modes for the supported oxide
catalysts [717,34,74]. Thus, the Raman information about
the supported metal oxide is directly relevant to the catalytic
reaction.
Bulk oxides possess a three-dimensional character, and
most typically, only the outermost layer is exposed to the
reacting molecules. Most spectroscopic characterization
techniques, including Raman, able to function under
reaction conditions only provide information about the
bulk structures and are not surface spectroscopic techniques.
Consequently, the spectroscopic signals will be dominated
by the contribution from the oxide bulk rather than the
outermost
surface.
Furthermore,
bulk
electronic
and
molecular structures are not expected to directly correlate
with the catalytic performance taking place on the outermost
surface layer. Nevertheless, the reaction environment may
simultaneous modify both the bulk lattice and the surface
layer of the catalyst [75]. For instance, V-P-O catalysts
undergo significant changes in performance and in situ
spectroscopic studies underline the bulk lattice re-structur-
ing of this system during n-butane oxidation to maleic
anhydride [7682] as well as crystallization of the outermost
layers with reaction time [77]. These bulk and surface
structural transformations have been correlated with the V-
P-O catalytic performance and occur because the redox
catalytic cycles and the water product generated [7582]. It
is interesting to note that the catalytic performance of
surface VOx and POx dispersed on a titania support is
actually similar to that of bulk V-P-O during butane
oxidation [83]. This observation suggests that highly
dispersed supported metal oxide catalytic systems are
probably excellent models for the corresponding bulk mixed
metal oxide systems. Interestingly, several recent investiga-
tions are beginning to reveal that the surface composition of
many mixed metal oxide catalytic systems may also be very
different than the bulk lattice composition [77,8487]. In
some cases, the surfaces of bulk mixed metal oxides have

even been found to be decorated by a complete close-packed
monolayer of only one of the metal oxide components [88
90]. These recent findings have enormous implications for
the catalysis science of mixed metal oxide catalysts.
For most bulk mixed metal oxide systems, the surface-to-
volume ratio is rather low because of their generally modest
surface areas (Fig. 1). This low number of surface sites and
their weak spectroscopic signals accounts for why the spectra
of mixed metal oxides are dominated by the bulk metal oxide
phases. One approach to minimize this limitation is to
minimize the particle size of the mixed metal oxides by
supporting such catalytic materials on a high surface area
support. Thus, the surface-to-volume ratio for such systems is
significantly increased and the spectroscopic analysis of the
outermostsurface layerissignificantly facilitated.Inaddition,
this also allows for the stabilization of nano-sized crystallites
on an oxide support without the typical sintering that is
observed for the corresponding unsupported mixed metal
oxide catalysts [9193] (see Fig. 1).
3. Operando Raman-GC case study
The structural and kinetic behavior of an alumina-
supported nanocrystalline vanadium antimonate mixed
oxide catalytic system during propane ammoxidation is
presented in Fig. 2 [25,42]. The left side of the figure shows
the Raman spectra for the alumina supported mixed SbVO
oxides under different reaction environments, and the right
hand side of the figure contains the corresponding catalytic
activity/selectivity data. Total loading of the supported VOx
and SbOx metal oxides was chosen to be close to monolayer
surface coverage. The catalyst was found to activate during
time on stream under the propane ammoxidation reaction in
a conventional fixed bed reactor at a given temperature [92],
which is in line with literature data. The in situ Raman
spectra of the dehydrated fresh and used catalyst underline
the important modifications in the molecular structures of
the
supported
SbVO
catalyst
during
the
propane
ammoxidation reaction [92]. The fresh catalyst in the
operando
cell
at
200 8C
exhibits
Raman
features
1024 cm1 (corresponding to the terminal V O stretching
vibration) and a broad Raman band centered at 900 cm1
(associated with the stretching vibration of the bridging V
OV bond) that are characteristic of surface vanadia species
on alumina under dehydrated conditions. No features of
antimony oxide are evident due to the weak signal from the
amorphous Sb oxide species on alumina. As the reaction
temperature increases, catalytic activity becomes measur-
able and the Raman spectra of the catalyst undergo
significant transformations. For example, the vibrational
mode at 1024 cm1 belonging to the surface VOx species on
Al2O3 almost disappears and the broad band centered at
900 cm1 shifts to a new broad band centered at
800 cm1, which is characteristic of crystalline VSbO4
(rutile). In addition, new Raman bands at 190 and 250 cm1
also appear that are characteristic of characteristic of
crystalline Sb2O4. The new crystalline metal oxide phases
form at the expense of the surface SbOx and VOx species. At
480 8C, the catalyst possesses nano-crystalline SbVO4 and
Sb2O4 phases and also becomes more selective towards
acrylonitrile formation. The catalytic activity/selectivity
values in the operando spectroscopic reactor are in
agreement with those obtained in the conventional fixed
bed reactor [92,25]. Bulk Sb2O4 is a mixed-valence oxide
containing both Sb3+ and Sb5+ sites. The oxidation states in
crystalline bulk SbVO4 are Sb5+ and V3+ according to
Mo
ssbauer and EPR spectroscopy, respectively [94,95]. An
operando EPR study also confirmed the formation of V3+
species in the corresponding titania-supported V-Sb-O
catalytic system [43]. This operando Raman-GC case study
nicely demonstrates the potential of the operando metho-
dology to follow the genesis of the active catalyst under
reaction conditions and, thus, directly establish links
between catalyst structure and activity/selectivity during
reaction conditions.
Reoxidation does not affect the crystalline bulk VSbO4
phase, but restores some of the surface vanadia V5+ species
(Raman band at 1024 cm1) and decreases the signal from
the
segregated
crystalline
bulk
Sb2O4
phase.
These
structural changes are reversible since upon returning to
the ammoxidation reaction conditions the surface VOx
Raman signal is significantly diminished and the crystalline
Sb2O4 Raman signal is again enhanced. Bulk VSbO4
appears to facilitate these structural transformations since it
is able to form many stoichiometries around the V1Sb1O4
structure [96,97]. Accordingly, incorporation of V3+ into
VSbO4 results in higher amounts of segregated a-Sb2O4 and
vice versa. The reversible migration of V cations from the
VSbO4 lattice appears to be compensated by the migration

the
segregated antimony oxide [25,42].
The above example nicely demonstrates the capabilities
of operando Raman-GC, but each spectroscopic technique
provides a piece of electronic and molecular structural
information of the catalytic materials and the influence of
the catalytic reaction environments. A detailed under-
standing will typically require the concurrence of several
complementary
spectroscopic
techniques
[43].
For
instance, the presence of reduced oxidation states of
supported oxides during reaction cannot always be clearly
established
with
Raman
spectroscopy
measurements.
Combination of UVvis-DRS and Raman spectroscopy,
however, provide better understanding of oxidation states of
supported vanadium oxide catalysts at different surface
coverage, on different oxide supports and with different
hydrocarbons [98102]. Combined Raman and UVvis-
DRS also allows for correction of Raman signal intensity as
well as information on the oxidation states of supported
oxide
catalysts
during
non-oxidative
dehydrogenation
conditions [8,103]. The combined use of IR and Raman
also provides information about the nature of chemisorbed
species and the catalytic active sites during reaction
conditions [102,104] and under operando conditions [30].
Thus,
the
combined
use
of
several
complementary
techniques affords more detailed electronic and molecular
structural insights into the nature of surface catalytic active
sites as well as surface reaction intermediates and their
adsorption sites on the catalyst.
4. Conclusions
The operando methodology is a combined spectroscopic
measurement and simultaneous online measurement of
catalytic activity/selectivity values during catalytic reaction
studies. The contemporary catalyst structural and kinetic
data greatly facilitates the molecular level understanding of
the structureactivity/selectivity relationships of catalytic
materials under different reaction conditions. Both the
catalyst structure and activity/selectivty must be relevant to
the catalytic system being investigated. The optimum
spectroscopic cell for operando studies should be designed
to
provide
catalytic
performance
data
similar
to
a
conventional catalytic reactor. The catalytic material and
spectroscopic techniques should be chosen so that the
structural information obtained is relevant to the realistic
catalytic reaction condition. The use of several spectro-
scopic techniques will provide complementary information
that will significantly contribute to the molecular and
atomic understanding of structureactivity/selectivity rela-
tionships.
