1. Introduction
Vanadium oxide, as an active species, is present in most of the
catalysts for selective oxidation of alkanes [13], which allows
achieving a high productivity at moderate temperature. A rational
model of catalysts needs information on the nature of the active
centers and their role in the catalytic system. The catalytic
properties of the supported vanadium oxide species for the
selective oxidation processes are strongly affected by the vanadia
loading, preparation method, nature of the support and type of
promoter. The vanadium content determines type of the metal
oxide species present on the surface. The surface VOx species occur
in the isolated form at low loading evolving into polymerized
forms when increasing the vanadia content until the monolayer
coverage
is
reached.
The
segregate
V2O5
crystalline
phase
dominates on the surface support above monolayer coverage.
Among the catalysts promoters, alkali metals are usually men-
tioned as promoters for industrial catalysts since they provide a
higher
selectivity
for
partial
oxidation
reactions
[4,5].
The
molecular structure of supported vanadium oxides and oxide
supports (e.g. TiO2) has been studied by different experimental
techniques [68]. The theoretical calculation and modeling permit
to describe the structure, spectra characteristics and reactivity [9
14]. An interaction of the alkali cations with the oxide supports has
been detailed studied by experimental [1517] and theoretical
[1820] techniques. However, the role of alkali dopants on the
structure and properties of supported vanadium oxide is not fully
understood. Titania-supported vanadia catalysts exhibit a notice-
able dependence on the preparation method or the coverage level
of the support. Below monolayer coverage, supported species do
not form the aggregates of the V-alkali-O phases. However, the
evident interaction, which results in the weakening of the vanadyl
group and in the changes of the reactivity exists [1517].
The present work aims to provide a molecular description of the
structure and reactivity of the vanadium oxide catalysts supported
on titanium oxide and the importance of alkali doping on their
structure and reactivity by a combined theoretical and experi-
mental studies. The surface features have been determined by
complementary studies of theoretical modeling (DFT) and experi-
mental in situ Raman spectroscopy and temperature-programmed
reduction (TPR). The structural and reactive features are contrasted
with those described by theoretical calculation. The results
obtained will be
important for
understanding the
changes
occurring during the catalytic act as well as will be complementary
tools to describe the structures and activity observed during
operando studies.

A periodic model has been selected to model the structure and reducibility of vanadia/titania catalysts
and the effect of alkali doping for Li, Na and K. Alkali interact with both the surface vanadia units and the
support. The calculated changes on vanadia structure are consistent with the changes evidenced by
Raman spectroscopy. Reducibility is modeled by adsorption of one hydrogen atom, forming hydroxyl
groups with the bridging VOTi present in the model. The adsorption energy decreases in the series
Li > Na > K, in agreement with experimental TPR results.

2. Experimental
2.1. Computational studies
The periodic DFT calculations have been performed with the
VASP code [21,22] using the PerdewBurkeErnzerhof functional
[23,24] for the total energy determination. Spin-polarized calcula-
tions have been performed for the open shell systems (hydro-
genated and alkali doped systems). The valence electrons have
been described by plane waves based functions (cutoff ener-
gy = 400 eV) with the following electrons treated explicitly: O:
s2p4, Ti: s2d2, V: s2d3, M: s1 (M = Li, Na), K: s1p6. The core electrons
are replaced by PAW generated pseudopotentials [25,26]. The
reciprocal space is sampled with a Monkhorst-Pack 3  3  1 grid.
All atoms of the models are relaxed and the optimization of the
geometry is carried out by the conjugated gradient algorithm.
The models contain both the support, a plane (0 0 1) of TiO2
anatase found in the powder commercial samples, and the active
phase, a V2O5 unit [27]. The final model of the surface is shown in
Fig. 1. A unit cell of dimension 7.57 A

 is used. A
vacuum space of 8 A
 is sufficient to avoid an interaction between
successive layers.
The alkali dopant effect is considered by the addition of a
neutral atom M to the vanadiatitania slab. The alkali atom is
localized between different vanadia units, according to Fig. 1. The
M:V:Tisurface atomic ratio in the model is 1:2:4, which is close to the
experimental preparation [17,28,29]. Therefore, the model pos-
sesses both acidic centers and redox centers (vanadium atoms) as
well as centers (vanadyl group and bridging oxygen atoms)
accessible for the reaction. Detailed description of the geometry of
doped systems is presented below.
2.2. Preparation of samples
The catalysts were prepared by sequential impregnation of
titanium (IV) oxide (Alfa Aesar, 100% anatase, SBET = 166 m2/g). At
the beginning, TiO2 was modified by the solution of alkali
hydroxides. Dissolution of alkali metal precursors was performed
by stirring an aqueous solution during 1020 min. The suspension
was evaporated in rotatory evaporator at 65 8C. The obtained
materials were dried at 110 8C for 16 h and the samples were
calcined at 450 8C for 4 h in air (heating rate = 5 8C min1). Vanadia
supported on alkali-doped titania catalysts were prepared by
impregnation with an aqueous solution of ammonium metava-
nadate (Sigma, 99.99%). Oxalic acid (Panreac, 99.5%) was added to
an aqueous solution of NH4VO3 to facilitate dissolving the salt.
Dissolution of vanadium precursor mixture was carried out by
stirring at 50 8C for 50 min. The solid obtained after impregnation
was dried and calcined at the same conditions like modified
supports.
The total vanadium content corresponds to half monolayer (4 V
atoms/nm2 of TiO2 support). The concentration of alkali cations
was selected by a mode that a V/alkali metal atomic ratio was 4/
0.6. Catalysts are labeled as xV/yK/TiO2, where x and y indicate
the number of atoms per nm2 of vanadia and alkali metal,
respectively.
2.3. Temperature programmed reduction (H2-TPR)
The reducibility properties of the alkali-doped vanadia catalysts
were studied by H2-TPR. The reduction was performed in a U
shaped fixed-bed quartz reactor with a Micromeritics TPD/TPR
2900 analyzer equipped with a thermal conductivity detector
(TCD). The reduction was carried out with 10 vol.%. of H2/Ar
mixture with a flow rate 40 cm3 min1. 30 mg of sample placed in
the reactor was dehydrated in a synthetic air flow at 400 8C
(heating rate = 5 8C min1). Subsequently, the sample was cooled
to room temperature, and then it was reduced at a heating rate
10 8C min1 to 950 8C under 10% H2/Ar. The water produced during
the reduction was condensed in a cold trap dipped in a mixture of
isopropanol and liquid nitrogen.

Renishaw System-1000 microscope Raman equipped with a cooled
CCD detector (73 8C) and holographic super-Notch filter for

with the 514 nm Ar+ line; spectral resolution was near 3 cm1 and
spectrum acquisition consisted of 20 accumulations of 10 s. The
spectra were obtained under in situ dehydrated conditions in a hot
stage (Linkam TS-1500). The samples were dehydrated in synthetic
air at 400 8C for 1 h. The rate of the heating was 5 8C min1. The
spectra of dehydrated samples were recorded at room temperature

after cooling the samples. The spectra of hydrated samples were
obtained at room temperature in a flow of humid air.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Geometry
The presence of alkali atoms disturbs the vanadiatitania
system geometry in different aspects. On the one hand, the alkali
atoms form a strong ionic bond with both the vanadium and the
support units. The alkali atom binds to two vanadium oxide units
dispersed on the titania surface in our model. In accordance to this
model, alkali atom forms bonds with a bridging oxygen OB in VO
Ti and the other one to a terminal oxygen OT in V
O group, as is
presented in Fig. 1. The MO distances obtained from the
optimization are summarized in Table 1. At the same time, alkali
atoms interact with the support oxygen, which is visible from the
MOX bond length. The bond distance (MOX) increases with the
size of the alkali metal with the following order: ca. 1.90 A
 for Li, ca.
2.20 A
 for Na and ca. 2.80 A
 for K. The largest alkali atom, K, is in
interaction with a third vanadium oxide unit (not shown).
The second important geometry effect is the vanadyl group
(V
O) bond elongation due to the close presence of alkali metals.
The V
O bond is lengthened from 1.615 A
 to 1.652 A
 with a
movement of the corresponding Raman band toward minor
energies. The Raman band position of the vanadyl mode is
extremely sensitive to the length of the bond [30]. This elongation
would affect the activity of the material if the vanadyl group were
involved in the reaction.
3.2. Raman
The
Raman
spectra
of
alkali-free
and
titania-supported
vanadium oxide species are shown in Fig. 2. The Raman band at
1020 cm1 corresponds to the vibration of the terminal vanadyl
group (V
O). The addition of the alkali promoters to the catalysts
induces mainly a red shift of the vibration frequency related to
V
O bond. It indicates a weakening of the V
O double bond. A
dependence between bond distance and bond order with V
O
vibration Raman frequency was clearly demonstrated previously
[30]. The experimental results obtained confirm the prediction of
V
O bond elongation by alkali promoters addition to the vanadia/
titania system described by modeling.
3.3. Hydrogenation
At last, the hydrogenation was modeled to probe the redox
properties of the alkali-modified systems. Hydrogen interacts with
surface oxygen sites forming a strong OH bond:
H  Osurf
2 ! OsurfH  1e
The electron is transferred to the surface vanadium sites
reducing them. Hydrogen atom is anchored to different oxygen
sites in the model. Two oxygen sites in the vanadia unit were
explored in the theoretical system: bridging VOTi (OB) and
terminal (OT). The (OB) site is preferable for the hydrogenation
according to the results observed for previous studies of undoped
surface areas [11].
The hydrogenation process is exothermic [31] and more
favorable for undoped systems according to the values shown in
Fig. 3, Table 2. For the same VOTi (OB) site, the alkali-doped
systems show a decrease of the first hydrogen adsorption energy in
the order undoped (2.97 eV) > Li (2.70 eV) > Na (2.63 eV) > K
(2.54 eV). In view of these results, the catalyst doped with lithium
is more reducible than doped with potassium. It is important to
note that the studied model considers a neutral alkali atom, which
reduces the vanadium site immediately and forms a cationic
species M+. Even if the alkali atom is found as a cation, the fact that
the catalyst is already reduced before considering hydrogenation

could affect the results. A parallel study demonstrates that the use
of MOH units instead of M units, at the same V:Ti:M atomic ratio,
points to the same conclusion [32]. In that model the alkali atom is
cationic and no electron transfer occurs between the MOH and the
catalyst. The decrease of the reducibility in the series Li > Na > K
therefore seems to be related to the presence of the cationic alkali,
and recovers the same trend found for the neutral M model.
3.4. H2-TPR profiles
The effect of the alkali metal addition to the vanadia/titania
catalysts on the reduction profiles is shown in Fig. 4. All catalysts
keep the same V/alkali ion atomic ratio. The presence of the Li ion
decreases the reducibility of dispersed vanadium oxide species
compared to the undoped system. The reduction becomes more
difficult with the period of the alkali atom in the periodic table.
Hence, the sequence of the experimental reducibility, undoped
>Li > Na > K, agrees with the predicted modeling tendency of the
reactivity of titania-supported vanadium oxide catalysts.
The structure and reactivity modeling of the solid materials
reflects a close interaction between alkali additives and both
supported oxides and matrices. The alkali atom affects more than
one vanadium center; therefore it can explain a major complexity
of the reduction profiles of the materials doped with Na and K.
It is worthy to notice the vanadyl bond weakening with the
addition of alkali metal; hence it diminishes the reducibility of
the supported vanadium species (Figs. 3 and 4) and activity in the
oxidation reactions [1517]. It was widely discussed in the
literature if the V
O group is an active center for the oxidation
reaction. However, there exist important experimental evidences
suggesting that V
O bond is not involved in the critical step of the
hydrocarbon oxidation reactions [1]. Previous studies pointed out
a great importance of the type of matrices utilized. The change of
the support modifies the V
O bond, which again does not
correspond to the activity changes, but rather points to the
oxygen center associated to an interface between supported oxide
and support (VO-support bond) [33,34]. Unfortunately, the study
of that oxygen centers is not experimentally facile. The theoretical
calculations carried out in this work allow valuing reactivity by a
comparison of the two oxygen centers. The results presented in
this work demonstrate that the reducibility does not correspond to
the strength changes in V
O bond and preferred sites for the
hydrogen interaction are the bridging oxygen (OB) in VOTi bond.
This has a direct implication for the understanding of different
parafins and olefins oxidation reactions, ammonia oxidation or
selective catalytic reduction, among others.
The dispersion of the active phase is crucial for the catalytic
activity and should be carefully studied. Alkali doping appears to
minimize vanadia polymerization due to the strong interaction
with the support and alkali sites at the interface; this is particularly
important for larger alkali units, such as potassium. Modelling
highly dispersed catalysts is technically difficult and needs large
unit cells. However, the reactivity of dispersed systems is found to
depend critically on the surface concentration of vanadia [35].
4. Conclusions
The combination of theoretical and experimental studies
describes in a consistent way the effect of the alkali additives
on the titania-supported vanadium oxide catalysts. The alkali
atoms bind to both vanadia units and support forming strong ionic
bonds. The vanadia/titania materials modified by alkali atoms
possess a lower reducibility than the undoped catalyst. The
bridging oxygen VOTi is more reactive than the terminal oxygen
of vanadyl group (V
O). It determines  a priori  which can be an
active site. The reducibility of the vanadium oxide species
decreases according to a sequence undoped > Li > Na > K.
