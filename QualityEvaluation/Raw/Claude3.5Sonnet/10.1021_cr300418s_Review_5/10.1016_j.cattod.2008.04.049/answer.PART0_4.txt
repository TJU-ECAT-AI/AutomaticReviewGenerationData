[1] "The Raman spectra of alkali-free and titania-supported vanadium oxide species are shown in Fig. 2. The Raman band at 1020 cm1 corresponds to the vibration of the terminal vanadyl group (V
O). The addition of the alkali promoters to the catalysts induces mainly a red shift of the vibration frequency related to V
O bond."

[2] "The presence of the Li ion decreases the reducibility of dispersed vanadium oxide species compared to the undoped system. The reduction becomes more difficult with the period of the alkali atom in the periodic table. Hence, the sequence of the experimental reducibility, undoped >Li > Na > K, agrees with the predicted modeling tendency of the reactivity of titania-supported vanadium oxide catalysts."

[3] "The surface features have been determined by complementary studies of theoretical modeling (DFT) and experimental in situ Raman spectroscopy and temperature-programmed reduction (TPR)."

Raman spectroscopy, combined with other techniques like theoretical modeling (DFT) and temperature-programmed reduction (TPR), provides valuable insights into the characterization and understanding of doped catalysts. In this study on alkali-doped vanadia on titania catalysts, Raman spectroscopy revealed shifts in the vanadyl group vibration frequency upon alkali addition, indicating changes in bond strength. This spectral feature correlates with the catalyst's reducibility, as confirmed by TPR experiments.

The combination of these techniques allows for a comprehensive analysis of the catalyst's composition, structure, and in situ behavior. Raman spectroscopy specifically helps to identify changes in bond strengths and local structures, which can be related to the catalyst's reactivity. The study demonstrates that the reducibility of the vanadium oxide species decreases in the order of undoped > Li > Na > K, a trend that is consistent with both the Raman spectral shifts and the TPR results.

This multi-technique approach provides a more complete understanding of the relationship between spectral features and catalyst properties, such as reducibility. By correlating Raman spectral changes with TPR results and theoretical calculations, researchers can gain deeper insights into the impact of dopants on catalyst structure and performance.

拉曼光谱与其他技术（如理论建模（DFT）和程序升温还原（TPR））相结合，为掺杂催化剂的表征和理解提供了宝贵的见解。在这项关于钛载碱金属掺杂钒氧化物催化剂的研究中，拉曼光谱揭示了碱金属添加后钒基团振动频率的变化，表明键强发生了变化。这一光谱特征与催化剂的可还原性相关，并通过TPR实验得到了证实。

这些技术的结合允许对催化剂的组成、结构和原位行为进行全面分析。拉曼光谱特别有助于识别键强度和局部结构的变化，这些变化可以与催化剂的反应活性相关联。该研究表明，钒氧化物物种的可还原性按未掺杂 > Li > Na > K的顺序降低，这一趋势与拉曼光谱位移和TPR结果一致。

这种多技术方法提供了对光谱特征和催化剂性质（如可还原性）之间关系的更完整理解。通过将拉曼光谱变化与TPR结果和理论计算相关联，研究人员可以更深入地了解掺杂剂对催化剂结构和性能的影响。
