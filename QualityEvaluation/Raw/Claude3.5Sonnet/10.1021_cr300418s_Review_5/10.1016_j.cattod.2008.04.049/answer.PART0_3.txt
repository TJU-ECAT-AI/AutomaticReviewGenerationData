[1] "The Raman spectra of alkali-free and titania-supported vanadium oxide species are shown in Fig. 2. The Raman band at 1020 cm1 corresponds to the vibration of the terminal vanadyl group (V
O). The addition of the alkali promoters to the catalysts induces mainly a red shift of the vibration frequency related to V
O bond."

[2] "The presence of the Li ion decreases the reducibility of dispersed vanadium oxide species compared to the undoped system. The reduction becomes more difficult with the period of the alkali atom in the periodic table. Hence, the sequence of the experimental reducibility, undoped >Li > Na > K, agrees with the predicted modeling tendency of the reactivity of titania-supported vanadium oxide catalysts."

[3] "The surface features have been determined by complementary studies of theoretical modeling (DFT) and experimental in situ Raman spectroscopy and temperature-programmed reduction (TPR)."

Raman spectroscopy, combined with other analytical techniques like temperature-programmed reduction (TPR) and theoretical modeling (DFT), provides comprehensive characterization of doped catalysts. For alkali-doped vanadia on titania catalysts:

1. Raman spectroscopy reveals structural changes, particularly the weakening of the V=O bond upon alkali doping, indicated by a red shift in the vanadyl vibration frequency.

2. TPR profiles show changes in reducibility with alkali doping, demonstrating a decrease in reducibility following the order undoped > Li > Na > K.

3. The combination of these techniques allows correlation between spectral features (Raman shifts) and catalyst properties (reducibility), providing insights into the structure-property relationships.

4. In situ Raman studies enable observation of catalyst behavior under reaction-like conditions.

5. The experimental results validate and complement theoretical predictions, enhancing understanding of the catalyst system.

This multi-technique approach provides a holistic view of the catalyst composition, structure, in situ behavior, and reactivity, offering valuable insights into the effects of doping on catalyst properties and performance.

拉曼光谱与其他分析技术如程序升温还原(TPR)和理论建模(DFT)相结合，为掺杂催化剂提供了全面的表征。对于碱金属掺杂的钛载钒氧化物催化剂：

1. 拉曼光谱揭示了结构变化，特别是碱金属掺杂后V=O键的弱化，这表现为钒酰基振动频率的红移。

2. TPR谱图显示了碱金属掺杂后还原性的变化，表明还原性按未掺杂 > Li > Na > K的顺序降低。

3. 这些技术的组合允许将光谱特征（拉曼位移）与催化剂性质（还原性）相关联，从而深入了解结构-性能关系。

4. 原位拉曼研究能够观察类反应条件下催化剂的行为。

5. 实验结果验证并补充了理论预测，增进了对催化剂系统的理解。

这种多技术方法提供了催化剂组成、结构、原位行为和反应性的整体视图，为掺杂对催化剂性质和性能的影响提供了宝贵的见解。
