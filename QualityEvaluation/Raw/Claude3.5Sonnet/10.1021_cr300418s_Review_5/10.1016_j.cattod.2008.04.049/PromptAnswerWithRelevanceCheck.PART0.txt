[1] "The Raman spectra of alkali-free and titania-supported vanadium oxide species are shown in Fig. 2. The Raman band at 1020 cm1 corresponds to the vibration of the terminal vanadyl group (V
O). The addition of the alkali promoters to the catalysts induces mainly a red shift of the vibration frequency related to V
O bond."

[2] "The experimental results obtained confirm the prediction of V
O bond elongation by alkali promoters addition to the vanadia/titania system described by modeling."

[3] "The present work aims to provide a molecular description of the structure and reactivity of the vanadium oxide catalysts supported on titanium oxide and the importance of alkali doping on their structure and reactivity by a combined theoretical and experimental studies. The surface features have been determined by complementary studies of theoretical modeling (DFT) and experimental in situ Raman spectroscopy and temperature-programmed reduction (TPR)."

[4] "The effect of the alkali metal addition to the vanadia/titania catalysts on the reduction profiles is shown in Fig. 4. All catalysts keep the same V/alkali ion atomic ratio. The presence of the Li ion decreases the reducibility of dispersed vanadium oxide species compared to the undoped system. The reduction becomes more difficult with the period of the alkali atom in the periodic table."

Raman spectroscopy, combined with other analytical techniques like temperature-programmed reduction (TPR) and theoretical modeling (DFT), contributes significantly to the comprehensive characterization and understanding of doped catalysts. In the case of alkali-doped vanadia on titania catalysts, Raman spectroscopy provides valuable insights into the composition and structure of the catalyst surface.

Specifically, Raman spectroscopy reveals changes in the vibrational frequencies of the vanadyl (V=O) group upon alkali doping. The observed red shift in the Raman band corresponding to the V=O vibration indicates a weakening and elongation of the V=O bond due to the presence of alkali promoters. This spectral feature correlates with the structural changes predicted by theoretical modeling.

The combination of in situ Raman spectroscopy with TPR allows for the investigation of the catalyst's behavior under reaction conditions and its reducibility. The TPR profiles show that the addition of alkali metals decreases the reducibility of dispersed vanadium oxide species, with the effect becoming more pronounced for heavier alkali metals.

By correlating the Raman spectral features with TPR results and theoretical calculations, researchers can establish relationships between the catalyst's structure and its properties, such as reducibility. This multi-technique approach provides a more comprehensive understanding of the doped catalyst system, including how the dopants interact with both the active phase and the support, and how these interactions influence the catalyst's reactivity and performance.

拉曼光谱与其他分析技术如程序升温还原（TPR）和理论建模（DFT）相结合，对掺杂催化剂的综合表征和理解做出了重要贡献。在碱金属掺杂的钛载钒氧化物催化剂中，拉曼光谱为催化剂表面的组成和结构提供了宝贵的见解。

具体来说，拉曼光谱揭示了碱金属掺杂后钒酰基（V=O）的振动频率变化。观察到的V=O振动对应的拉曼带红移表明，由于碱金属助剂的存在，V=O键被削弱和伸长。这一光谱特征与理论建模预测的结构变化相吻合。

将原位拉曼光谱与TPR结合使用，可以研究催化剂在反应条件下的行为及其还原性。TPR曲线显示，添加碱金属会降低分散钒氧化物物种的还原性，这种效应随着碱金属原子量的增加而更加明显。

通过将拉曼光谱特征与TPR结果和理论计算相关联，研究人员可以建立催化剂结构与其性质（如还原性）之间的关系。这种多技术方法为掺杂催化剂系统提供了更全面的理解，包括掺杂剂如何与活性相和载体相互作用，以及这些相互作用如何影响催化剂的反应性和性能。

Raman spectroscopy, combined with other techniques like theoretical modeling (DFT) and temperature-programmed reduction (TPR), provides valuable insights into the characterization and understanding of doped catalysts. In this study on alkali-doped vanadia on titania catalysts, Raman spectroscopy revealed shifts in the vanadyl group vibration frequency upon alkali addition, indicating changes in bond strength. This spectral feature correlates with the catalyst's reducibility, as confirmed by TPR experiments.

The combination of these techniques allows for a comprehensive analysis of the catalyst's composition, structure, and in situ behavior. Raman spectroscopy specifically helps to identify changes in bond strengths and local structures, which can be related to the catalyst's reactivity. The study demonstrates that the reducibility of the vanadium oxide species decreases in the order of undoped > Li > Na > K, a trend that is consistent with both the Raman spectral shifts and the TPR results.

This multi-technique approach provides a more complete understanding of the relationship between spectral features and catalyst properties, such as reducibility.
