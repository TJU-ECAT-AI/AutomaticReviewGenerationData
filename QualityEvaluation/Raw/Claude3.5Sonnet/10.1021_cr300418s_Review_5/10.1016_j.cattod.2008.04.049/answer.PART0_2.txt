[1] "The Raman spectra of alkali-free and titania-supported vanadium oxide species are shown in Fig. 2. The Raman band at 1020 cm1 corresponds to the vibration of the terminal vanadyl group (V
O). The addition of the alkali promoters to the catalysts induces mainly a red shift of the vibration frequency related to V
O bond. It indicates a weakening of the V
O double bond."

[2] "The presence of the Li ion decreases the reducibility of dispersed vanadium oxide species compared to the undoped system. The reduction becomes more difficult with the period of the alkali atom in the periodic table. Hence, the sequence of the experimental reducibility, undoped >Li > Na > K, agrees with the predicted modeling tendency of the reactivity of titania-supported vanadium oxide catalysts."

[3] "The present work aims to provide a molecular description of the structure and reactivity of the vanadium oxide catalysts supported on titanium oxide and the importance of alkali doping on their structure and reactivity by a combined theoretical and experimental studies. The surface features have been determined by complementary studies of theoretical modeling (DFT) and experimental in situ Raman spectroscopy and temperature-programmed reduction (TPR)."

Raman spectroscopy, in combination with other analytical techniques, contributes significantly to the comprehensive characterization and understanding of doped catalysts in several ways:

1. Composition and structure: Raman spectroscopy provides information about the vibrational modes of chemical bonds in the catalyst, allowing identification of specific structural features. For example, in the case of alkali-doped vanadia on titania, the Raman band at 1020 cm-1 corresponds to the terminal vanadyl group (V=O).

2. In situ behavior: The use of in situ Raman spectroscopy allows for observation of catalysts under reaction conditions, providing insights into structural changes that occur during catalytic processes.

3. Reactivity: Changes in Raman spectra can indicate alterations in reactivity. In the case of alkali-doped vanadia catalysts, the red shift of the V=O vibration frequency upon alkali addition indicates a weakening of the V=O double bond, which correlates with changes in catalyst reactivity.

4. Relationship between spectral features and catalyst properties: The study demonstrates a correlation between Raman spectral features and catalyst reducibility. The observed red shift in the V=O vibration frequency corresponds to a decrease in catalyst reducibility, as confirmed by temperature-programmed reduction (TPR) studies.

5. Complementary to other techniques: The study combines Raman spectroscopy with theoretical modeling (DFT) and TPR to provide a comprehensive understanding of the catalyst system. This multi-technique approach allows for validation of theoretical predictions and provides a more complete picture of catalyst structure-property relationships.

By integrating Raman spectroscopy with other analytical and theoretical methods, researchers can gain deep insights into the composition, structure, and behavior of doped catalysts, as well as establish relationships between spectral features and important catalyst properties such as reducibility.

拉曼光谱与其他分析技术相结合，在多个方面为掺杂催化剂的全面表征和理解做出了重要贡献：

1. 成分和结构：拉曼光谱提供了催化剂中化学键振动模式的信息，允许识别特定的结构特征。例如，在碱金属掺杂的钛载钒氧化物催化剂中，1020 cm-1处的拉曼带对应于端基钒酰基团（V=O）。

2. 原位行为：使用原位拉曼光谱可以在反应条件下观察催化剂，提供了关于催化过程中结构变化的见解。

3. 反应性：拉曼光谱的变化可以指示反应性的改变。在碱金属掺杂的钒氧化物催化剂中，V=O振动频率的红移表明V=O双键减弱，这与催化剂反应性的变化相关。

4. 光谱特征与催化剂性质之间的关系：该研究展示了拉曼光谱特征与催化剂可还原性之间的相关性。观察到的V=O振动频率红移对应于催化剂可还原性的降低，这通过程序升温还原（TPR）研究得到了证实。

5. 与其他技术互补：该研究将拉曼光谱与理论建模（DFT）和TPR相结合，提供了对催化剂系统的全面理解。这种多技术方法允许验证理论预测，并提供了更完整的催化剂结构-性质关系图景。

通过将拉曼光谱与其他分析和理论方法相结合，研究人员可以深入了解掺杂催化剂的成分、结构和行为，并建立光谱特征与重要催化剂性质（如可还原性）之间的关系。
