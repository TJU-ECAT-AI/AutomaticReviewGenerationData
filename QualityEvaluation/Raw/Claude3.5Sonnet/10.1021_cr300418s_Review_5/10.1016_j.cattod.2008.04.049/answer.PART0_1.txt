[1] "The Raman spectra of alkali-free and titania-supported vanadium oxide species are shown in Fig. 2. The Raman band at 1020 cm1 corresponds to the vibration of the terminal vanadyl group (V
O). The addition of the alkali promoters to the catalysts induces mainly a red shift of the vibration frequency related to V
O bond. It indicates a weakening of the V
O double bond."

[2] "The presence of the Li ion decreases the reducibility of dispersed vanadium oxide species compared to the undoped system. The reduction becomes more difficult with the period of the alkali atom in the periodic table. Hence, the sequence of the experimental reducibility, undoped >Li > Na > K, agrees with the predicted modeling tendency of the reactivity of titania-supported vanadium oxide catalysts."

[3] "The present work aims to provide a molecular description of the structure and reactivity of the vanadium oxide catalysts supported on titanium oxide and the importance of alkali doping on their structure and reactivity by a combined theoretical and experimental studies. The surface features have been determined by complementary studies of theoretical modeling (DFT) and experimental in situ Raman spectroscopy and temperature-programmed reduction (TPR)."

Raman spectroscopy, combined with other analytical techniques, contributes significantly to the comprehensive characterization and understanding of doped catalysts in several ways:

1. Structural information: Raman spectroscopy provides insights into the molecular structure of catalysts. In this study, it revealed the presence and changes in the vanadyl (V=O) bond in vanadia/titania catalysts.

2. In situ behavior: The technique allows for in situ measurements, enabling the observation of catalysts under reaction conditions or during treatments like dehydration.

3. Dopant effects: Raman spectroscopy can detect changes induced by dopants. In this case, it showed a red shift in the V=O vibration frequency upon addition of alkali promoters, indicating a weakening of the bond.

4. Complementary to other techniques: The study combined Raman spectroscopy with theoretical modeling (DFT) and temperature-programmed reduction (TPR) to provide a more comprehensive understanding of the catalysts.

5. Structure-property relationships: By correlating Raman spectral features with other properties like reducibility (from TPR), insights into structure-property relationships can be gained. For instance, the weakening of the V=O bond observed by Raman corresponded to changes in reducibility.

6. Validation of theoretical models: Experimental Raman results can be used to validate theoretical calculations, enhancing the overall understanding of the catalyst system.

While this study focused on alkali-doped vanadia on titania, the approach of combining Raman spectroscopy with other techniques can be applied to various doped catalyst systems, including Ce-doped CoCr2O4, to gain similar insights into their composition, structure, and reactivity.

拉曼光谱与其他分析技术相结合，对掺杂催化剂的全面表征和理解做出了重要贡献，具体表现在以下几个方面：

1. 结构信息：拉曼光谱提供了催化剂分子结构的洞察。在这项研究中，它揭示了钒钛催化剂中钒基（V=O）键的存在和变化。

2. 原位行为：该技术允许进行原位测量，能够在反应条件下或在脱水等处理过程中观察催化剂。

3. 掺杂剂效应：拉曼光谱可以检测掺杂剂引起的变化。在这种情况下，它显示了添加碱性促进剂后V=O振动频率的红移，表明键强度减弱。

4. 与其他技术互补：该研究将拉曼光谱与理论建模（DFT）和程序升温还原（TPR）相结合，以提供对催化剂更全面的理解。

5. 结构-性能关系：通过将拉曼光谱特征与其他性质（如来自TPR的可还原性）相关联，可以获得结构-性能关系的见解。例如，拉曼观察到的V=O键减弱与可还原性的变化相对应。

6. 理论模型的验证：实验拉曼结果可用于验证理论计算，增强对催化剂系统的整体理解。

虽然这项研究集中在钛上的碱掺杂钒，但将拉曼光谱与其他技术相结合的方法可以应用于各种掺杂催化剂系统，包括Ce掺杂的CoCr2O4，以获得关于它们的成分、结构和反应性的类似见解。
