<EnglishVersionAnswer>

The provided literature does not contain any information relevant to answering the question about promoters addressing limitations of CO2's weak oxidation potential and inertness in chromium-based catalytic systems. The text appears to be a citation for an academic article about ordered mesoporous Ce1-xZrxO2 solid solutions, which is unrelated to the topic of the question. Therefore, this question cannot be answered based on the given information.
