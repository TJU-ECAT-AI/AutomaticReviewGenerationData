[1] "CO2 has been proposed to participate in the redox cycles of Cr2+  Cr3+ (59,64) or Cr3+  Cr6+; (56,80,91) however, its oxidation potential is rather weak. Besides, CO2 is quite inert and not easily activated by CrOx."

[2] "The addition of O2 in the reactants as a co-feed with CO2 has been initially proposed to overcome these issues, yet the selectivity drops."

[3] "An alternative is to introduce promoters to facilitate CO2 activation on the Cr2O3 catalysts and to improve its oxidizing ability for selective and stable performance."

[4] "Because of their basic property, alkali metal oxides have been widely used as promoters for CO2 adsorption and activation in CO2 hydrogenation reactions."

[5] "The major role of Ni is to facilitate CO2 dissociation to CO and an adsorbed O* next to the Ni site, which can subsequently regenerate Cr3+ via reoxidation."

Promoters address the limitations of CO2's weak oxidation potential and inertness in chromium-based catalytic systems by facilitating CO2 activation and improving its oxidizing ability. They offer several advantages over O2 co-feeding:

1. Selectivity: While O2 co-feeding can overcome CO2's limitations, it leads to a drop in selectivity. Promoters, on the other hand, can enhance CO2 activation without compromising selectivity.

2. CO2 adsorption and activation: Alkali metal oxides, due to their basic properties, promote CO2 adsorption and activation in CO2 hydrogenation reactions.

3. Improved oxidizing ability: Promoters like Ni facilitate CO2 dissociation, generating adsorbed oxygen species that can regenerate Cr3+ through reoxidation, enhancing the overall oxidizing ability of the system.

4. Stability: Some promoters, such as potassium, can improve the stability of C3H6 yield in the reaction.

5. Tuning of catalyst properties: Promoters can modify the surface properties of the catalyst, such as redox potential and surface acidity, allowing for fine-tuning of catalytic performance.

By addressing these aspects, promoters offer a more balanced approach to enhancing CO2 activation and improving oxidizing ability while maintaining selectivity and stability in chromium-based catalytic systems.

促进剂通过促进CO2活化和提高其氧化能力来解决铬基催化系统中CO2氧化势弱和惰性的限制。与O2共进料相比，它们提供了几个优势：

1. 选择性：虽然O2共进料可以克服CO2的局限性，但会导致选择性下降。相比之下，促进剂可以增强CO2活化而不影响选择性。

2. CO2吸附和活化：碱金属氧化物由于其碱性特性，促进CO2在CO2加氢反应中的吸附和活化。

3. 提高氧化能力：像Ni这样的促进剂促进CO2解离，产生吸附的氧物种，这些物种可以通过再氧化再生Cr3+，从而增强系统的整体氧化能力。

4. 稳定性：一些促进剂，如钾，可以提高反应中C3H6产率的稳定性。

5. 调节催化剂性质：促进剂可以修改催化剂的表面性质，如氧化还原电位和表面酸度，从而可以精细调节催化性能。

通过解决这些方面，促进剂在增强CO2活化和提高氧化能力的同时，还能保持铬基催化系统的选择性和稳定性，从而提供了一种更平衡的方法。
