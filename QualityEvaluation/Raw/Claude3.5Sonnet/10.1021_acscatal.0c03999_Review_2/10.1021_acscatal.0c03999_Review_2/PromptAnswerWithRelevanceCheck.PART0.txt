[1] "CO2 has been proposed to participate in the redox cycles of Cr2+  Cr3+ (59,64) or Cr3+  Cr6+; (56,80,91) however, its oxidation potential is rather weak. Besides, CO2 is quite inert and not easily activated by CrOx."

[2] "The addition of O2 in the reactants as a co-feed with CO2 has been initially proposed to overcome these issues, yet the selectivity drops."

[3] "An alternative is to introduce promoters to facilitate CO2 activation on the Cr2O3 catalysts and to improve its oxidizing ability for selective and stable performance."

[4] "Because of their basic property, alkali metal oxides have been widely used as promoters for CO2 adsorption and activation in CO2 hydrogenation reactions."

[5] "Ru is a potential promoter because of its high activity in CO2 hydrogenation."

[6] "Ni is also a potential candidate because of its activity in CO2 activation for CO2 reforming reactions (96,97) and RWGS."

[7] "The major role of Ni is to facilitate CO2 dissociation to CO and an adsorbed O* next to the Ni site, which can subsequently regenerate Cr3+ via reoxidation."

Promoters address the limitations of CO2's weak oxidation potential and inertness in chromium-based catalytic systems by facilitating CO2 activation and improving its oxidizing ability. They offer several advantages over O2 co-feeding:

1. Selectivity: While O2 co-feeding can overcome CO2's limitations, it leads to a drop in selectivity. Promoters, on the other hand, can enhance CO2 activation while maintaining or improving selectivity.

2. CO2 Adsorption and Activation: Alkali metal oxides, due to their basic properties, promote CO2 adsorption and activation in CO2 hydrogenation reactions.

3. Improved Hydrogenation: Ru serves as a potential promoter due to its high activity in CO2 hydrogenation, which can enhance the overall reaction process.

4. Enhanced CO2 Dissociation: Ni promotes CO2 activation for reforming reactions and water-gas shift reactions. It facilitates CO2 dissociation to CO and adsorbed O*, which can then regenerate Cr3+ through reoxidation.

5. Stability: Some promoters, like K in alkali metal oxides, can improve the stability of C3H6 yield.

By introducing these promoters, the catalytic system can achieve more selective and stable performance compared to O2 co-feeding, while effectively addressing CO2's weak oxidation potential and inertness.

Promoters address the limitations of CO2's weak oxidation potential and inertness in chromium-based catalytic systems by facilitating CO2 activation and improving its oxidizing ability. They offer several advantages over the alternative strategy of O2 co-feeding:

1. Selectivity: While O2 co-feeding can overcome the issues of weak oxidation potential and inertness, it leads to a drop in selectivity. In contrast, promoters can enhance CO2 activation while maintaining or improving selectivity.

2. CO2 Adsorption and Activation: Alkali metal oxides, due to their basic properties, are widely used as promoters for CO2 adsorption and activation in CO2 hydrogenation reactions. This helps overcome CO2's inertness.

3. Improved Oxidizing Ability: Promoters like Ni facilitate CO2 dissociation to CO and an adsorbed O*, which can then regenerate Cr3+ through reoxidation. This process enhances the overall oxidizing ability of the system.

4. Stability: Promoters can contribute to more stable catalytic performance compared to unpromoted systems or those using O2 co-feeding.

5. Tailored Performance: Different promoters can be chosen to target specific aspects of the reaction. For example, alkali metal oxides focus on CO2 adsorption and activation, while transition metals like Ni enhance CO2 dissociation and chromium regeneration.

By addressing both CO2 activation and oxidizing ability, promoters offer a more comprehensive solution to the limitations of CO2 in chromium-based catalytic systems, allowing for selective and stable performance without the drawbacks associated with O2 co-feeding.
