[1] "An alternative is to introduce promoters to facilitate CO2 activation on the Cr2O3 catalysts and to improve its oxidizing ability for selective and stable performance."

[2] "Because of their basic property, alkali metal oxides have been widely used as promoters for CO2 adsorption and activation in CO2 hydrogenation reactions."

[3] "Ru is a potential promoter because of its high activity in CO2 hydrogenation."

[4] "Ni is also a potential candidate because of its activity in CO2 activation for CO2 reforming reactions (96,97) and RWGS."

[5] "The major role of Ni is to facilitate CO2 dissociation to CO and an adsorbed O* next to the Ni site, which can subsequently regenerate Cr3+ via reoxidation."

Promoters address the limitations of CO2's weak oxidation potential and inertness in chromium-based catalytic systems by facilitating CO2 activation and improving its oxidizing ability. They offer several advantages over alternative strategies like O2 co-feeding:

1. Selective and stable performance: Promoters enhance CO2 activation while maintaining selectivity, unlike O2 co-feeding which can lead to a drop in selectivity.

2. Improved CO2 adsorption and activation: Alkali metal oxides, due to their basic properties, promote CO2 adsorption and activation in CO2 hydrogenation reactions.

3. Enhanced CO2 hydrogenation: Ru serves as an effective promoter due to its high activity in CO2 hydrogenation reactions.

4. Facilitated CO2 dissociation: Ni promotes CO2 activation by facilitating its dissociation into CO and adsorbed O*, which can then regenerate Cr3+ through reoxidation.

5. Balanced reactivity: Promoters like Ru can help balance reverse water-gas shift (RWGS) and C3H6 reforming reactions, optimizing both activity and selectivity.

By introducing these promoters, the catalytic system can overcome CO2's limitations and achieve improved performance in terms of activation, oxidizing ability, and overall catalytic efficiency.

促进剂通过促进CO2活化和提高其氧化能力来解决基于铬的催化系统中CO2氧化能力弱和惰性的限制。与O2共进料等替代策略相比，它们提供了几个优势：

1. 选择性和稳定性能：促进剂增强CO2活化的同时保持选择性，而O2共进料可能导致选择性下降。

2. 改善CO2吸附和活化：碱金属氧化物由于其碱性特性，促进CO2在CO2加氢反应中的吸附和活化。

3. 增强CO2加氢：钌由于其在CO2加氢反应中的高活性，作为有效的促进剂。

4. 促进CO2解离：镍通过促进CO2解离为CO和吸附的O*来促进CO2活化，后者可以通过再氧化重新生成Cr3+。

5. 平衡反应性：像钌这样的促进剂可以帮助平衡逆水气变换（RWGS）和C3H6重整反应，优化活性和选择性。

通过引入这些促进剂，催化系统可以克服CO2的局限性，并在活化、氧化能力和整体催化效率方面实现性能改善。
