[1] "CO2 has been proposed to participate in the redox cycles of Cr2+  Cr3+ (59,64) or Cr3+  Cr6+; (56,80,91) however, its oxidation potential is rather weak. Besides, CO2 is quite inert and not easily activated by CrOx."

[2] "The addition of O2 in the reactants as a co-feed with CO2 has been initially proposed to overcome these issues, yet the selectivity drops."

[3] "An alternative is to introduce promoters to facilitate CO2 activation on the Cr2O3 catalysts and to improve its oxidizing ability for selective and stable performance."

[4] "Because of their basic property, alkali metal oxides have been widely used as promoters for CO2 adsorption and activation in CO2 hydrogenation reactions."

[5] "The major role of Ni is to facilitate CO2 dissociation to CO and an adsorbed O* next to the Ni site, which can subsequently regenerate Cr3+ via reoxidation."

Promoters address the limitations of CO2's weak oxidation potential and inertness in chromium-based catalytic systems by facilitating CO2 activation and improving its oxidizing ability. They offer several advantages over the alternative strategy of O2 co-feeding:

1. Selectivity: While O2 co-feeding can overcome the issues of weak oxidation potential and inertness, it leads to a drop in selectivity. In contrast, promoters can enhance CO2 activation while maintaining or improving selectivity.

2. CO2 Adsorption and Activation: Alkali metal oxides, due to their basic properties, are widely used as promoters for CO2 adsorption and activation in CO2 hydrogenation reactions. This helps overcome CO2's inertness.

3. Improved Oxidizing Ability: Promoters like Ni facilitate CO2 dissociation to CO and an adsorbed O*, which can then regenerate Cr3+ through reoxidation. This process enhances the overall oxidizing ability of the system.

4. Stability: Promoters can contribute to more stable catalytic performance compared to unpromoted systems or those using O2 co-feeding.

5. Tailored Performance: Different promoters can be chosen to target specific aspects of the reaction. For example, alkali metal oxides focus on CO2 adsorption and activation, while transition metals like Ni enhance CO2 dissociation and chromium regeneration.

By addressing both CO2 activation and oxidizing ability, promoters offer a more comprehensive solution to the limitations of CO2 in chromium-based catalytic systems, allowing for selective and stable performance without the drawbacks associated with O2 co-feeding.

促进剂通过促进CO2活化和提高其氧化能力来解决铬基催化系统中CO2氧化势弱和惰性的限制。与O2共进料的替代策略相比，它们提供了几个优势：

1. 选择性：虽然O2共进料可以克服氧化势弱和惰性的问题，但会导致选择性下降。相比之下，促进剂可以增强CO2活化，同时保持或提高选择性。

2. CO2吸附和活化：由于其碱性特性，碱金属氧化物被广泛用作CO2加氢反应中CO2吸附和活化的促进剂。这有助于克服CO2的惰性。

3. 改善氧化能力：像Ni这样的促进剂促进CO2解离成CO和吸附的O*，然后可以通过再氧化重新生成Cr3+。这个过程增强了系统的整体氧化能力。

4. 稳定性：与未促进的系统或使用O2共进料的系统相比，促进剂可以贡献更稳定的催化性能。

5. 定制性能：可以选择不同的促进剂来针对反应的特定方面。例如，碱金属氧化物专注于CO2吸附和活化，而像Ni这样的过渡金属增强CO2解离和铬的再生。

通过解决CO2活化和氧化能力两个方面，促进剂为铬基催化系统中CO2的限制提供了更全面的解决方案，允许选择性和稳定性能，而没有与O2共进料相关的缺点。
