Promoters address the limitations of CO2's weak oxidation potential and inertness in chromium-based catalytic systems by facilitating CO2 activation and improving its oxidizing ability. They offer several advantages over alternative strategies like O2 co-feeding:

1. Selective and stable performance: Promoters enhance CO2 activation while maintaining selectivity, unlike O2 co-feeding which can lead to a drop in selectivity.

2. Improved CO2 adsorption and activation: Alkali metal oxides, as basic promoters, enhance CO2 adsorption and activation in CO2 hydrogenation reactions.

3. Enhanced CO2 hydrogenation: Ru promoters contribute to improved CO2 hydrogenation activity.

4. Facilitated CO2 dissociation: Ni promoters assist in CO2 dissociation to CO and adsorbed O*, which can then regenerate Cr3+ through reoxidation.

5. Balanced reactivity: Proper amounts of promoters like Ru can optimize activity and selectivity by balancing reactions such as RWGS and C3H6 reforming.

Overall, promoters offer a more targeted approach to enhancing CO2 activation and improving oxidizing ability while maintaining selectivity and stability in chromium-based catalytic systems.

促进剂通过促进CO2活化和改善其氧化能力来解决铬基催化系统中CO2氧化势弱和惰性的限制。与O2共进料等替代策略相比，它们提供了几个优势：

1. 选择性和稳定性能：促进剂增强CO2活化的同时保持选择性，而O2共进料可能导致选择性下降。

2. 改善CO2吸附和活化：碱金属氧化物作为碱性促进剂，增强了CO2加氢反应中的CO2吸附和活化。

3. 增强CO2加氢：Ru促进剂有助于提高CO2加氢活性。

4. 促进CO2解离：Ni促进剂有助于CO2解离为CO和吸附的O*，后者可以通过再氧化重新生成Cr3+。

5. 平衡反应性：适量的促进剂（如Ru）可以通过平衡RWGS和C3H6重整等反应来优化活性和选择性。

总的来说，促进剂为铬基催化系统提供了一种更有针对性的方法来增强CO2活化和改善氧化能力，同时保持选择性和稳定性。
