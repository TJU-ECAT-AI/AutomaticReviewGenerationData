ABSTRACT 
 
Zeolites ZSM-5, mordenite and SAPO-34 were synthesized hydrothermally, using 
hexamethylenediamine(HMDA), tetraethylammonium bromide (TEABr) and morpholine as 
directing agents, respectively. Their catalytic performances in C4-olefin cracking reactions 
were investigated under a weight hourly space velocity as high 15 h-1. It was found that the 
acid strength of these samples followed the order of H-SAPO-34<H-ZSM-5<H-mordenite; 
and their stability in the catalytic test followed the order of H-SAPO-34 
H-ZSM-5>H-mordenite. Among these samples, the H-ZSM-5 zeolite was the optimal catalyst 
for C4-olefin cracking to produce propylene. The H-ZSM-5 zeolite with small crystal size 
exhibited higher stability than the H-ZSM-5 with large crystal size for a long time-on-stream. 
 
1 . INTRODUCTION 
 
Propylene is one of the most important basic organic feedstocks and is currently faced with a 
serious supply deficit in petrochemical industry as a result of the huge growth in demand for 
propylene derivatives, e.g., polypropylene. However, the traditional methods for increasing 
propylene yield are not satisfactory. For example, the naphtha steam cracking process [1, 2], 
which produces about twice as much ethylene as propylene, is a costly route because of the 
enormous capital investment and the high feedstock cost. Propane dehydrogenation could 
give a high yield of propylene but the feedstock is only cost effective during limited periods 
of the year, making the process expensive enough to limit the production of propylene. 
Propylene could also be generated in FCC units but its yield is relatively low. And the route 
for producing propylene from metathesis of ethylene and butylenes is not attractive since it 
will consume the same high-value ethylene as the main feedstock. Thus the development of 
more reasonable processes with high yield of propylene is desirable. One of the most effective 
approaches for this purpose is to integrate the propylene production process into refinery or 
petrochemical plants from less valuable feedstock, such as catalytic cracking of mixed C4- or 
higher carbon olefins [1-8]. Zeolites, because of their outstanding thermal and hydrothermal 
stability, acidity and shape selectivity, have been widely used in industrial processes [9-11]. In 
this paper, we explored the possibility to produce propylene via catalytic cracking of surplus 
C4-olefin over three typical catalysts, namely H-mordenite, H-ZSM-5 and H-SAPO-34,

covering the range of 12-, 10-, and 8-member-ring zeolites or zeotypes. Among these samples, 
the H-ZSM-5 zeolite is by far the most appropriate zeolite catalyst in terms of both the 
resistance to deactivation and the propylene yield. 
 
2 . EXPERIMENTAL 
 
2.1 Preparation of catalysts  
ZSM-5 (Si/Al = 20), mordenite (Si/Al = 20) and SAPO-34 were synthesized 
hydrothermally in a teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave with a capacity of 100 ml using 
hexamethylenediamine (HMDA), tetraethylammonium bromide (TEABr) and morpholine as 
the template, respectively. SAPO-34 was synthesized following the procedure described in

First, you need to sequentially extract any quotes in the literature that are most relevant to each question, and print them in numbered order, separated by newlines. Quotes should be relatively brief. Do not attempt to summarize or answer questions at this stage, but simply repeat exactly what the corresponding part of the literature says.

Please enclose the full list of quotes in <quotes></quotes> XML tags. If there are no relevant quotes, write "No relevant quotes" instead.

Then, answer the question, starting with "Answer:".  Do not include or reference quoted content verbatim in the answer. Don't say "According to Quote [1]" when answering. Do not write reference number of quotes after answer. Put your answer to the user inside <EnglishVersionAnswer></EnglishVersionAnswer> XML tags. Output formatted text, with line breaks for each question.Separate quotes and answers with a blank line. Provide the answers to all questions in English. After completing the English answers, translate all those answers into Chinese and provide the Chinese version inside <ChineseVersionAnswer></ChineseVersionAnswer> XML tags.

Thus, the format of your overall response should look like what's shown between the <example></example> tags.  Make sure to follow the formatting and spacing exactly.
