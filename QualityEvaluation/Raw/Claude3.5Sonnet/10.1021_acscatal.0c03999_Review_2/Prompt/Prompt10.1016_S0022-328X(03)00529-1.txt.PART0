Abstract
Rhodium nanoparticles supported on g-Al2O3, derived from arene-solvated Rh atoms stabilized by trioctylamine (TOA), are
valuable catalysts in hydrogenation and silylformylation reactions. They are largely more active than the analogous commercial
catalyst, as well as of a sample similarly prepared in the absence of TOA. HRTEM measurements, IR studies on adsorbed CO
species and extended X-ray absorption fine structure analyses evidenced the role of TOA in controlling the particle growth in the
preparative process and in stabilizing the resulting Rh particles against erosion by CO and oxidation.

1. Introduction
Recently, there has been a great deal of attention on
the use of metal nanoparticles as valuable catalysts [1].
Their catalytic properties are strongly related to the
particle size and recent findings on their size-dependent
chemistry has added a new dimension to the subject [2].
However, stabilizers are usually used to avoid agglom-
eration to bulk metal and the kind of stabilizer can also
strongly affect their catalytic behaviour [3]. In the
hydrogenation reaction, for instance, strong interacting
ligands, like tetraalkylammonium halides, poly-N-vinyl-
2-pyrrolidone, 1,10-phenantroline, have been found to
restrict the catalytic activity [1j], while hydroxyalkyl
ammonium salts or aliphatic amines with long alkyl
groups (C8 or higher) have been reported to greatly
improve the efficiency of the catalytic precursor [1i,4].
Moreover, solvent-stabilized metal microclusters, ob-
tained by reaction of metal vapour with weakly co-
ordinating organic ligands (acetone, tetrahydrofuran,
toluene, etc.) (solvated metal atoms), are very active
homogeneous catalytic precursors in a wide range of
reactions, including hydrogenation, hydrosilylation, hy-
droformylation, silylformylation and oligo-polymeriza-
tion of olefins and acetylenes [1c,1l,5]. With the aim to
provide a further insight into the subject, we have

studied the activity of catalysts prepared from arene-
solvated Rh atoms, containing trioctylamine (TOA) as
additional stabilizer. Such systems are excellent starting
materials for the preparation of new supported catalysts
largely more active and selective than analogous samples
commercially available or similarly prepared in the
absence of TOA. We report here evidence for their
peculiar catalytic properties and some data on their
structural features. For this, the catalysts have been
characterized by HRTEM analyses, IR studies on
adsorbed CO species and extended X-ray absorption
fine structure (EXAFS) investigations.
2. Experimental
2.1. General
All operations involving the metal vapour synthesis
(MVS) products were performed under a dry argon
atmosphere. The co-condensation of rhodium and
mesitylene was carried out in a static reactor previously
described [6]. The mesitylene-solvated Rh atoms
solution was worked up under argon atmosphere with
the use of the standard Schlenk techniques. The amount
of rhodium in the above solutions was determined by
atomic absorption spectrometry in a electrochemically
heated graphite furnace with a Perkin/Elmer 4100ZL
instrument. Solvents were purified by conventional
methods, distilled and stored under argon. TOA,
cinnamaldehyde, methyl benzoate, 1-hexyne were com-
mercial products and were degassed and stored under
argon before use. Commercial g-Al2O3 (Chimet product,
type 49, surface area 110 m2 g1, mean particle diameter
31 mm) was dried in a static oven before use. Commer-
cial rhodium on g-Al2O3 (5 wt.% of Rh, surface area 130
m2 g1) was an Engelhardt product.
The infrared spectra of adsorbed CO studies were
obtained with a Bruker IFS-28 spectrometer with MCT
detector (128 scans, resolution 4 cm1). H2 and CO with
high-purity grade were used without further purifica-
tion. The samples, in the form of self-supporting pellet,
were put into an IR quartz cell with KBr windows and
outgassed at room temperature (r.t.) for 50 min (residual
pressure into the vacuum line B/105 Torr). After that,
the samples were treated with H2 (100 Torr) for 12 h at
r.t., outgassed at r.t. for 1 h and then put into contact
with 100 Torr of CO, monitoring the spectra at
increasing contact time with CO up to 2 h.
Electron
micrographs
were
obtained
by
a
Jeol
2000EX microscope. Before the introduction in the
instrument, the samples, in the form of powders, were
ultrasonically dispersed in isopropyl alcohol and a drop
of the suspension was deposited on a copper grid
covered with a lacey carbon film. Histograms of the
particle size distribution were obtained by counting onto
the micrographs at least 300 particles; the mean particle
diameter (dm) was calculated by using the formula dm/
adini/ani where ni was the number of particles of
diameter di. In the case of metal particles of the Rh/g-
Al2O3 (MVS) systems, the diameter di used for the
calculation in these two cases has been the medium value
of each dimensions interval in the histogram, thus with a
resulting uncertainty of 9
/0.25 nm. The reason for this
different data treatment is that rhodium particles in
these two cases were very small and the usual mean
diameter calculation (where the di considered is usually
the highest limit of each dimensions interval) lead to an
uncertainty of 9
/0.5 nm for the mean diameter obtained,
and such uncertainty limit was too high for the
considered metal particles.
The catalytic samples were prepared for the EXAFS
experiments by suspending the fine powders mixed with
boron-nitride in ethanol, drying the mixtures under
vacuum and pressing them into pellets. The sample
amount was calculated in order to achieve a reasonable
edge jump of about 0.7.
The EXAFS measurements at the Rh K-edge (23.220
keV) have been performed at the GILDA beamline [7]
of
the
European
Synchrotron
Radiation
Facility
(ESRF, Grenoble). The radiation was monochromated
and horizontally focused by using a double crystal
Si(3 1 1) monochromator [8]; two Pt mirrors were used
to reject the higher harmonics and focus the beam in the
vertical direction [7].
Two reference samples (a-Rh2O3 and Rh foil) and
two MVS derived catalysts (Rh/g-Al2O3 and Rh(TOA)/
g-Al2O3) were studied, all in transmission mode, using
two Ar-filled ionization chambers to detect the incident
(I0) and transmitted (IT) X-ray beam. The measured
absorption coefficient is defined as m(E)/ln(I0/IT). All
spectra were recorded at 77 K in order to reduce the
thermal effects.
The GLC analyses were performed on a Perkin/
Elmer Auto System gas chromatograph, equipped with
a flame ionization detector (FID), using a SiO2 column
(DB1, 30 m/0.52 mm, 5 mm) and helium as carrier gas.
1H- and 13C-NMR spectra were measured on Varian
Gemini 200 spectrometer
at 200 and 50.3 MHz,
respectively, using chloroform-d as solvent; chemical
shifts are relative to internal Si(CH3)4.
2.2. Preparation of the rhodium catalysts
2.2.1. Synthesis of the solvated Rh atoms
In a typical experiment, rhodium vapour, generated
by resistive heating of a tungsten wire surface coated
with electrodeposited rhodium (100/150 mg), was co-
condensed at liquid nitrogen temperature with mesity-
lene (40 ml) in the glass reactor chamber of the MVS
apparatus in ca. 40 min. The reactor chamber was
warmed to the melting point of the solid matrix (ca. 
/

38
40 8C) and the resulting brown solution was siphoned at
low temperature in a Schlenk tube and kept in a
refrigerator at 
/20 8C. The content of the metal
solution was 1.2 mg Rh ml1 (0.0117 mg atom ml1).
2.2.2. Preparation of rhodium on g-Al2O3 catalysts
The above brown Rh/mesitylene reaction solution
(mesitylene-solvated metal atoms) (8.34 ml, 10 mg Rh)
was added to a suspension of g-Al2O3 (10 g) in
mesitylene (20 ml). The mixture was stirred for 12 h at
room temperature. The colourless solution was removed
and the light-brown solid, containing 0.1 wt.% Rh, was
washed with pentane and dried under reduced pressure.
The Rh/g-Al2O3 catalysts, containing 1 and 5 wt.% Rh,
were prepared similarly using 1 g and 190 mg of g-
Al2O3, respectively.
2.2.3. Preparation of rhodium/trioctylamine (TOA) on
g-Al2O3 catalysts
2.2.3.1. Preparation of Rh(TOA)/mesitylene solution.
TOA (0.30 ml, 0.69 mmol) was added at the MVS Rh/
mesitylene solution (20 ml, 0.23 mg atom) and the
mixture was stirred for 1 h at room temperature. The
resulting
brown
Rh(TOA)/mesitylene
solution
was
stable at room temperature for a long time (ca. 3
months).
2.2.3.2. Preparation of the Rh(TOA)/g-Al2O3 catalysts.
The brown Rh(TOA)/mesitylene solution (8.34 ml, 10
mg Rh) was added to a suspension of g-Al2O3 (10 g) in
mesitylene (20 ml). The mixture was stirred for 12 h at
room temperature. The colourless mesitylene was re-
moved and the light-brown solid, containing 0.1 wt.%
Rh, was washed with pentane and dried under reduced
pressure. The Rh/g-Al2O3 catalysts, containing 1 and 5
wt.% Rh, were prepared similarly using 1 g and 190 mg
of g-Al2O3, respectively.
2.3. Catalytic reactions
2.3.1. Hydrogenation of methylbenzoate: general
procedure
The hydrogenation experiments were performed at 20
atm starting hydrogen pressure using a 75-ml stainless
steel autoclave equipped with a Teflon removable
cylinder Jacker, a magnetic bar, a stainless steel tap
and a manometer (100 atm end scale). The reactions
were performed by heating the autoclave in an oil bath
at 809
/1 8C. In a typical experiment, the autoclave was
charged, under argon atmosphere, with the rhodium
catalyst (0.064 mg atom), THF (10 ml) and methyl-
benzoate (0.8 ml, 6.4 mmol). The autoclave was closed,
argon was eliminated and hydrogen was introduced (20
atm). The reaction mixture was stirred (1200 rpm) and
heated to 80 8C. The reaction was monitored by GLC
analysis of liquid samples removed by the tap. The
methyl cyclohexenoate was identified by comparison of
its GLC retention time with that of an authentic sample.
The conversion as function of the time for different
catalysts is reported in Fig. 1.
2.3.2. Hydrogenation of cinnamaldehyde: general
procedure
A 50-ml round-bottomed flask was charged with the
rhodium catalyst (0.48 mg atom Rh), toluene (15 ml)
and cinnamaldehyde (6.1 ml, 48 mmol). The mixture
was stirred (ca. 1200 rpm) at room temperature for 12 h.
The solution was separated from the catalyst by
decantation and analysed by GLC. The products were
identified by comparison of their GLC retention times
with those of authentic samples. The results obtained
using different catalysts are reported in Table 1.
2.3.3. Silylformylation of 1-hexyne: general procedure
The silylformylation experiments were carried out at
10 atm CO starting pressure and room temperature in a
25-ml stainless steel autoclave previously described (see
Section 2.3.1). In a typical experiment, the autoclave
was charged under argon atmosphere with the rhodium
catalyst (0.002 mg atom), toluene (2 ml), dimethylphe-
nylsilane (0.31 ml, 2 mmol) and 1-hexyne (0.23 ml, 2
mmol). The autoclave was closed, argon was eliminated
and carbon monoxide was introduced (10 atm). The
reaction mixture was stirred (1200 rpm) and monitored
by GLC analysis of liquid samples removed by the tap.
When silane was completely converted, the autoclave
was discharged, pentane (20 ml) was added and the
surnatant liquid was separated from the catalyst by
decantation. The volatile materials were removed under
vacuum and the raw product was recovered by bulb-to-
bulb distillation (1 mmHg). Pure (Z)-1-(dimethylphe-
nylsilyl)-2-formyl-1-hexene was obtained by column
chromatography (silica gel; eluent, pentane:ethylacetate,
95/5) and characterized by 1H- and 13C-NMR [1j].

3. Results and discussion
3.1. Preparation of supported Rh catalysts
The reaction of Rh vapour with mesitylene in large
excess, at liquid nitrogen temperature in a reactor
elsewhere described [6], affords a reddish-brown matrix
which gives, on melting, a brown solution stable at
/ 40 8C containing mesitylene-stabilized Rh-hydride
microclusters [9]. The warming up to room temperature
in the presence of supports, such as g-Al2O3, results, by
a further clustering process, in a gentle deposition of
well-dispersed Rh nanoparticles on the support [10]
(Scheme 1).

In the presence of additional stabilizers, such as TOA,
the mesitylene-solvated Rh atoms become thermally
stable even at room temperature and they can be more
easily handled in order to deposit Rh nanoparticles on
supports (Scheme 2).

systems supported on g-Al2O3 at different Rh loading
