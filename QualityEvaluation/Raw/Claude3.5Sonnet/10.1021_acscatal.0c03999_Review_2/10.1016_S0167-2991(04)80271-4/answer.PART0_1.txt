[1] "CO2 was found to enhance the dehydrogenation of propane2 or ethane3 over silica supported chromium oxide."

[2] "It was confirmed that CO was selectively produced from CO2 in the dehydrogenation of C3H8 over Cr-MCM-41-DHT."

[3] "Not only O2 but also CO2 could regenerate the Cr6+O4 tetrahedra from the reduced Cr3+O6 octahedra as suggested by the results of TPR and EXAFS."

[4] "It is concluded that during the reaction C3H8 is dehydrogenated to C3H6 by Cr6+O4 tetrahedra, which is simultaneously reduced to Cr3+O6 octahedra. The reduced Cr3+O6 octahedra is reoxidized to Cr6+O4 tetrahedra by CO2, and thus the reduction-oxidation cycle between Cr6+O4 tetrahedra and Cr3+O6 octahedra possesses an important role in the dehydrogenation of C3H8 with CO2 over Cr-MCM-41."

The literature does not directly address promoters or compare CO2 to O2 co-feeding. However, it does provide insights into how CO2 functions in chromium-based catalytic systems:

CO2 enhances the dehydrogenation of propane and ethane over silica-supported chromium oxide catalysts. In the Cr-MCM-41 system, CO2 serves as a selective oxidant, producing CO during propane dehydrogenation. 

The key advantage of CO2 is its ability to regenerate the active Cr6+O4 tetrahedra species from reduced Cr3+O6 octahedra. This creates a reduction-oxidation cycle that is crucial for the dehydrogenation reaction. CO2 reoxidizes the reduced chromium species, allowing the catalyst to maintain its activity.

While the document doesn't explicitly compare CO2 to O2 co-feeding, it suggests that CO2 provides a more selective oxidation pathway, producing CO rather than potentially over-oxidizing the hydrocarbons. This selectivity, combined with the ability to regenerate the active catalyst species, indicates that CO2 offers advantages in terms of reaction control and catalyst stability compared to stronger oxidants like O2.

这篇文献没有直接讨论助剂或比较CO2与O2共进料。但是，它确实提供了CO2在铬基催化系统中如何发挥作用的见解：

CO2增强了在二氧化硅负载的氧化铬催化剂上丙烷和乙烷的脱氢反应。在Cr-MCM-41系统中，CO2作为选择性氧化剂，在丙烷脱氢过程中产生CO。

CO2的关键优势在于其能够将还原态的Cr3+O6八面体物种重新氧化为活性Cr6+O4四面体物种。这创造了一个对脱氢反应至关重要的还原-氧化循环。CO2重新氧化还原态的铬物种，使催化剂保持其活性。

虽然文档没有明确比较CO2和O2共进料，但它表明CO2提供了一个更具选择性的氧化途径，产生CO而不是可能过度氧化碳氢化合物。这种选择性，加上再生活性催化剂物种的能力，表明与O2等更强的氧化剂相比，CO2在反应控制和催化剂稳定性方面提供了优势。
