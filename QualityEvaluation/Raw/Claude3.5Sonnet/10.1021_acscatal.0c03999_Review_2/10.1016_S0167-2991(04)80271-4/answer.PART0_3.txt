[1] "CO2 was found to enhance the dehydrogenation of propane2 or ethane3 over silica supported chromium oxide."

[2] "It was confirmed that CO was selectively produced from CO2 in the dehydrogenation of C3H8 over Cr-MCM-41-DHT."

[3] "Not only O2 but also CO2 could regenerate the Cr6+O4 tetrahedra from the reduced Cr3+O6 octahedra as suggested by the results of TPR and EXAFS."

[4] "The reduced Cr3+O6 octahedra is reoxidized to Cr6+O4 tetrahedra by CO2, and thus the reduction-oxidation cycle between Cr6+O4 tetrahedra and Cr3+O6 octahedra possesses an important role in the dehydrogenation of C3H8 with CO2 over Cr-MCM-41."

The literature does not directly address promoters or compare CO2 to O2 co-feeding. However, it does provide some insights into how CO2 functions in chromium-based catalytic systems:

CO2 enhances the dehydrogenation of propane and ethane over silica-supported chromium oxide catalysts. In the Cr-MCM-41 system, CO2 serves as both an oxidant and a source of CO production. The key advantage of using CO2 is its ability to regenerate the active Cr6+O4 tetrahedra species from reduced Cr3+O6 octahedra. This creates a reduction-oxidation cycle between Cr6+ and Cr3+ species that is crucial for the dehydrogenation reaction.

While the paper does not explicitly compare CO2 to O2, it suggests that CO2 can effectively reoxidize the catalyst and maintain its activity. This indicates that CO2 may offer advantages in terms of selectivity and stability, as it participates in the reaction cycle without over-oxidizing the catalyst or products. However, more direct comparisons would be needed to fully assess the relative merits of CO2 versus O2 co-feeding in these systems.

这篇文献并未直接讨论促进剂或将CO2与O2共进料进行比较。然而，它确实提供了一些关于CO2在基于铬的催化系统中如何发挥作用的见解：

CO2增强了在硅胶负载的氧化铬催化剂上丙烷和乙烷的脱氢反应。在Cr-MCM-41系统中，CO2既作为氧化剂，又作为CO生成的来源。使用CO2的关键优势在于其能够将还原态的Cr3+O6八面体物种重新氧化为活性Cr6+O4四面体物种。这在Cr6+和Cr3+物种之间创造了一个还原-氧化循环，对脱氢反应至关重要。

虽然这篇论文没有明确比较CO2和O2，但它表明CO2可以有效地重新氧化催化剂并维持其活性。这表明CO2在选择性和稳定性方面可能具有优势，因为它参与反应循环而不会过度氧化催化剂或产物。然而，需要进行更直接的比较才能全面评估CO2相对于O2共进料在这些系统中的相对优势。
