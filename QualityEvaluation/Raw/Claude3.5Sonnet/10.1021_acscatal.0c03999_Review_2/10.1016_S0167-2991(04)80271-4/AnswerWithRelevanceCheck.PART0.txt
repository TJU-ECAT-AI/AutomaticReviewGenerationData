          [1] "CO2 was found to enhance the dehydrogenation of propane2 or ethane3 over silica supported chromium oxide."

          [2] "It was clearly observed that CO was selectively produced from CO2 during the C3H8 dehydrogenation over Cr-MCM-41."

          [3] "Not only O2 but also CO2 could regenerate the Cr6+O4 tetrahedra from the reduced Cr3+O6 octahedra as suggested by the results of TPR and EXAFS."

          [4] "It is concluded that during the reaction C3H8 is dehydrogenated to C3H6 by Cr6+O4 tetrahedra, which is simultaneously reduced to Cr3+O6 octahedra. The reduced Cr3+O6 octahedra is reoxidized to Cr6+O4 tetrahedra by CO2, and thus the reduction-oxidation cycle between Cr6+O4 tetrahedra and Cr3+O6 octahedra possesses an important role in the dehydrogenation of C3H8 with CO2 over Cr-MCM-41."

          The literature does not directly address promoters or compare CO2 to O2 co-feeding. However, it provides insights into how CO2 functions in chromium-based catalytic systems for propane dehydrogenation:

          1. CO2 enhances the dehydrogenation of propane and ethane over silica-supported chromium oxide catalysts.
          
          2. In the Cr-MCM-41 system, CO2 serves as both an oxidant and a source of CO production. It selectively produces CO during propane dehydrogenation.
          
          3. The key advantage of using CO2 is its ability to regenerate the active Cr6+O4 tetrahedra species from reduced Cr3+O6 octahedra. This creates a reduction-oxidation cycle between Cr6+ and Cr3+ species that is crucial for the dehydrogenation reaction.
          
          4. CO2 effectively reoxidizes the catalyst and maintains its activity, indicating that it can overcome its inherent inertness in this system.
          
          5. While not explicitly compared to O2, the selective oxidation by CO2 suggests it may offer advantages in terms of reaction control, selectivity, and catalyst stability compared to stronger oxidants like O2, which could lead to over-oxidation.
          
          6. The stability of the Cr-MCM-41 catalyst when using CO2 is demonstrated by its ability to be repeatedly regenerated, suggesting CO2 allows for stable catalytic performance in this system.

          These findings indicate that CO2 can effectively address its limitations of weak oxidation potential and inertness in this specific chromium-based catalytic system, providing a selective and stable performance for propane dehydrogenation.

          这篇文献并未直接讨论助剂或将CO2与O2共进料进行比较。然而，它提供了CO2在基于铬的催化系统中用于丙烷脱氢的作用机理：

          1. CO2增强了在二氧化硅负载的氧化铬催化剂上丙烷和乙烷的脱氢反应。

          2. 在Cr-MCM-41系统中，CO2既作为氧化剂，又作为CO生成的来源。它在丙烷脱氢过程中选择性地产生CO。

          3. 使用CO2的关键优势在于其能够将还原态的Cr3+O6八面体物种重新氧化为活性Cr6+O4四面体物种。这在Cr6+和Cr3+物种之间创造了一个对脱氢反应至关重要的还原-氧化循环。

          4. CO2有效地重新氧化催化剂并维持其活性，表明它可以在这个系统中克服其固有的惰性。

          5. 虽然没有明确与O2进行比较，但CO2的选择性氧化表明，相比于可能导致过度氧化的强氧化剂（如O2），它可能在反应控制、选择性和催化剂稳定性方面提供优势。

          6. 使用CO2时Cr-MCM-41催化剂的稳定性通过其能够反复再生得到证明，这表明CO2在该体系中能够实现稳定的催化性能。

          这些发现表明，CO2能够在这种特定的基于铬的催化系统中有效地解决其氧化能力弱和惰性的限制，为丙烷脱氢提供选择性和稳定的性能。
