[1] "It was confirmed that CO was selectively produced from CO2 in the dehydrogenation of C3H8 over Cr-MCM-41-DHT."

[2] "According to the results of curve deconvolution of the EXAFS spectrum of Cr/Cab-O-Sil, it is estimated that the spectrum is consisted of 30 % tetrahedral and 70 % octahedral coordination."

[3] "Not only O2 but also CO2 could regenerate the Cr6+O4 tetrahedra from the reduced Cr3+O6 octahedra as suggested by the results of TPR and EXAFS."

[4] "It is concluded that during the reaction C3H8 is dehydrogenated to C3H6 by Cr6+O4 tetrahedra, which is simultaneously reduced to Cr3+O6 octahedra. The reduced Cr3+O6 octahedra is reoxidized to Cr6+O4 tetrahedra by CO2, and thus the reduction-oxidation cycle between Cr6+O4 tetrahedra and Cr3+O6 octahedra possesses an important role in the dehydrogenation of C3H8 with CO2 over Cr-MCM-41."

The document does not directly address the use of promoters or compare CO2 to O2 co-feeding. However, it does provide insights into how CO2 functions in chromium-based catalytic systems for propane dehydrogenation:

CO2 acts as an oxidizing agent in the catalytic cycle, regenerating the active Cr6+ species. It selectively produces CO while oxidizing the reduced Cr3+ back to Cr6+. This redox cycle between Cr6+ and Cr3+ is crucial for the catalytic activity.

The Cr-MCM-41 catalyst allows for efficient use of CO2 in this role. The highly dispersed tetrahedral Cr6+ sites on MCM-41 can be readily reduced by propane and re-oxidized by CO2. This allows CO2 to effectively function as an oxidant despite its relative inertness.

While the document doesn't compare CO2 to O2 directly, it suggests CO2 provides selective oxidation to regenerate the catalyst while producing valuable CO as a by-product. This selectivity may be an advantage over O2, which could lead to over-oxidation.

The stability of the Cr-MCM-41 catalyst when using CO2 is demonstrated by its ability to be repeatedly regenerated, unlike the Cr/Cab-O-Sil catalyst. This suggests CO2 allows for stable catalytic performance in this system.

该文档并未直接讨论促进剂的使用或将CO2与O2共进料进行比较。但是,它确实提供了CO2在铬基催化系统中用于丙烷脱氢的作用机理:

CO2在催化循环中充当氧化剂,再生活性Cr6+物种。它选择性地产生CO,同时将还原态的Cr3+氧化回Cr6+。Cr6+和Cr3+之间的这种氧化还原循环对催化活性至关重要。

Cr-MCM-41催化剂允许CO2在这一作用中得到有效利用。分散在MCM-41上的四面体Cr6+位点可以被丙烷容易地还原,并被CO2重新氧化。这使得CO2能够有效地充当氧化剂,尽管它相对惰性。

虽然文档没有直接比较CO2和O2,但它表明CO2提供选择性氧化以再生催化剂,同时产生有价值的CO副产品。这种选择性可能是相对于O2的一个优势,因为O2可能导致过度氧化。

使用CO2时Cr-MCM-41催化剂的稳定性通过其能够反复再生得到证明,这与Cr/Cab-O-Sil催化剂不同。这表明CO2在该体系中能够实现稳定的催化性能。
