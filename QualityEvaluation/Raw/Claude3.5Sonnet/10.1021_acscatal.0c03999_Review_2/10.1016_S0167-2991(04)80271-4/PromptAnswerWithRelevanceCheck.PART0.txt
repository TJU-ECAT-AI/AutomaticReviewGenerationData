[1] "CO2 was found to enhance the dehydrogenation of propane2 or ethane3 over silica supported chromium oxide."

[2] "It was clearly observed that CO was selectively produced from CO2 during the C3H8 dehydrogenation over Cr-MCM-41."

[3] "Not only O2 but also CO2 could regenerate the Cr6+O4 tetrahedra from the reduced Cr3+O6 octahedra as suggested by the results of TPR and EXAFS."

[4] "It is concluded that during the reaction C3H8 is dehydrogenated to C3H6 by Cr6+O4 tetrahedra, which is simultaneously reduced to Cr3+O6 octahedra. The reduced Cr3+O6 octahedra is reoxidized to Cr6+O4 tetrahedra by CO2, and thus the reduction-oxidation cycle between Cr6+O4 tetrahedra and Cr3+O6 octahedra possesses an important role in the dehydrogenation of C3H8 with CO2 over Cr-MCM-41."

The literature does not directly address promoters or compare CO2 to O2 co-feeding. However, it does provide insights into how CO2 enhances catalytic performance in chromium-based systems:

CO2 enhances the dehydrogenation of propane and ethane over silica-supported chromium oxide catalysts. In the Cr-MCM-41 system, CO2 selectively produces CO during propane dehydrogenation. 

CO2 plays a crucial role in regenerating the active Cr6+ species. It reoxidizes the reduced Cr3+ octahedra back to Cr6+ tetrahedra, maintaining the catalytic cycle. This redox cycle between Cr6+ and Cr3+ is key to the dehydrogenation of propane with CO2.

While the document doesn't explicitly compare CO2 to O2, it suggests CO2 can effectively oxidize the catalyst and maintain activity. This indicates CO2 can overcome its inherent inertness in this system, likely due to the specific properties of the Cr-MCM-41 catalyst. The selective production of CO also implies CO2 activation is achieved without over-oxidation.

文献并未直接讨论助剂或将CO2与O2共进料进行比较。但是，它确实提供了关于CO2如何增强铬基催化系统性能的洞见：

CO2增强了在硅支撑的氧化铬催化剂上丙烷和乙烷的脱氢反应。在Cr-MCM-41系统中，CO2在丙烷脱氢过程中选择性地产生CO。

CO2在再生活性Cr6+物种方面起着关键作用。它将还原的Cr3+八面体重新氧化回Cr6+四面体，维持催化循环。这种Cr6+和Cr3+之间的氧化还原循环是CO2辅助丙烷脱氢的关键。

虽然文档没有明确比较CO2和O2，但它表明CO2可以有效地氧化催化剂并保持活性。这表明在这个系统中CO2可以克服其固有的惰性，这可能是由于Cr-MCM-41催化剂的特定性质。CO的选择性生成也意味着实现了CO2的活化，而没有过度氧化。

The literature does not directly address promoters or compare CO2 to O2 co-feeding. However, it does provide insights into how CO2 functions in chromium-based catalytic systems:

CO2 enhances the dehydrogenation of propane and ethane over silica-supported chromium oxide catalysts. In the Cr-MCM-41 system, CO2 serves as a selective oxidant, producing CO during propane dehydrogenation. 

The key advantage of CO2 is its ability to regenerate the active Cr6+O4 tetrahedra species from reduced Cr3+O6 octahedra. This creates a reduction-oxidation cycle that is crucial for the dehydrogenation reaction. CO2 reoxidizes the reduced chromium species, allowing the catalyst to maintain its activity.

While the document doesn't explicitly compare CO2 to O2 co-feeding, it suggests that CO2 provides a more selective oxidation pathway, producing CO rather than potentially over-oxidizing the hydrocarbons. This selectivity, combined with the ability to regenerate the active catalyst species, indicates that CO2 offers advantages in terms of reaction control and catalyst stability compared to stronger oxidants like O2.

这篇文献没有直接讨论助剂或比较CO2与O2共进料。但是，它确实提供了CO2在铬基催化系统中如何发挥作用的见解：

CO2增强了在二氧化硅负载的氧化铬催化剂上丙烷和乙烷的脱氢反应。在Cr-MCM-41系统中，CO2作为选择性氧化剂，在丙烷脱氢过程中产生CO。

CO2的关键优势在于其能够将还原态的Cr3+O6八面体物种重新氧化为活性Cr6+O4四面体物种。这创造了一个对脱氢反应至关重要的还原-氧化循环。CO2重新氧化还原态的铬物种，使催化剂保持其活性。

虽然文档没有明确比较CO2和O2共进料，但它表明CO2提供了一个更具选择性的氧化途径，产生CO而不是可能过度氧化碳氢化合物。这种选择性，加上再生活性催化剂物种的能力，表明与O2等更强的氧化剂相比，CO2在反应控制和催化剂稳定性方面提供了优势。

CO2 enhances the dehydrogenation of propane and ethane over silica-supported chromium oxide catalysts. In the Cr-MCM-41 system, CO2 plays a crucial role in the catalytic cycle by selectively producing CO and regenerating the active Cr6+ species.

Specifically, CO2 reoxidizes the reduced Cr3+O6 octahedra back to the active Cr6+O4 tetrahedra form. This reduction-oxidation cycle between Cr6+ and Cr3+ species is key to the dehydrogenation of propane with CO2 over Cr-MCM-41.

While the document doesn't directly compare CO2 to O2, it suggests that CO2 can effectively maintain catalyst activity through this redox cycle. This indicates that CO2 can serve as an effective oxidant in this system, potentially offering advantages in terms of selectivity and stability compared to O2 co-feeding, though further research would be needed to confirm this.

这篇文献并没有直接讨论助剂或比较CO2与O2共进料。然而，它确实提供了CO2在基于铬的催化体系中如何发挥作用的见解：

CO2增强了在硅胶负载的氧化铬催化剂上丙烷和乙烷的脱氢反应。在Cr-MCM-41体系中，CO2在催化循环中扮演着至关重要的角色，选择性地产生CO并再生活性Cr6+物种。

具体来说，CO2将还原态的Cr3+O6八面体重新氧化回活性Cr6+O4四面体形式。这种Cr6+和Cr3+物种之间的还原-氧化循环是Cr-MCM-41上CO2脱氢丙烷的关键。

虽然该文档没有直接比较CO2和O2，但它表明CO2可以通过这种氧化还原循环有效地维持催化剂活性。这表明CO2可以在该体系中作为有效的氧化剂，在选择性和稳定性方面可能比O2共进料具有优势，尽管还需要进一步的研究来证实这一点。

CO2 enhances the dehydrogenation of propane and ethane over silica-supported chromium oxide catalysts. In the Cr-MCM-41 system, CO2 serves as both an oxidant and a source of CO production.

This indicates that CO2 may offer advantages in terms of selectivity and stability, as it participates in the reaction cycle without over-oxidizing the catalyst or products. However, more direct comparisons would be needed to fully assess the relative merits of CO2 versus O2 co-feeding in these systems.

CO2增强了在硅胶负载的氧化铬催化剂上丙烷和乙烷的脱氢反应。在Cr-MCM-41系统中，CO2既作为氧化剂，又作为CO生成的来源。使用CO2的关键优势在于其能够将还原态的Cr3+O6八面体物种重新氧化为活性Cr6+O4四面体物种。这在Cr6+和Cr3+物种之间创造了一个还原-氧化循环，对脱氢反应至关重要。

虽然这篇论文没有明确比较CO2和O2，但它表明CO2可以有效地重新氧化催化剂并维持其活性。这表明CO2在选择性和稳定性方面可能具有优势，因为它参与反应循环而不会过度氧化催化剂或产物。然而，需要进行更直接的比较才能全面评估CO2相对于O2共进料在这些系统中的相对优势。

The document does not directly address the use of promoters or compare CO2 to O2 co-feeding. However, it does provide insights into how CO2 functions in chromium-based catalytic systems for propane dehydrogenation:

CO2 acts as an oxidizing agent in the catalytic cycle, regenerating the active Cr6+ species. It selectively produces CO while oxidizing the reduced Cr3+ back to Cr6+. This redox cycle between Cr6+ and Cr3+ is crucial for the catalytic activity.

The Cr-MCM-41 catalyst allows for efficient use of CO2 in this role. The highly dispersed tetrahedral Cr6+ sites on MCM-41 can be readily reduced by propane and re-oxidized by CO2. This allows CO2 to effectively function as an oxidant despite its relative inertness.

While the document doesn't compare CO2 to O2 directly, it suggests CO2 provides selective oxidation to regenerate the catalyst while producing valuable CO as a by-product. This selectivity may be an advantage over O2, which could lead to over-oxidation.

The stability of the Cr-MCM-41 catalyst when using CO2 is demonstrated by its ability to be repeatedly regenerated, unlike the Cr/Cab-O-Sil catalyst. This suggests CO2 allows for stable catalytic performance in this system.

该文档并未直接讨论促进剂的使用或将CO2与O2共进料进行比较。但是,它确实提供了CO2在铬基催化系统中用于丙烷脱氢的作用机理:

CO2在催化循环中充当氧化剂,再生活性Cr6+物种。它选择性地产生CO,同时将还原态的Cr3+氧化回Cr6+。Cr6+和Cr3+之间的这种氧化还原循环对催化活性至关重要。

Cr-MCM-41催化剂允许CO2在这一作用中得到有效利用。分散在MCM-41上的四面体Cr6+位点可以被丙烷容易地还原,并被CO2重新氧化。这使得CO2能够有效地充当氧化剂,尽管它相对惰性。

虽然文档没有直接比较CO2和O2,但它表明CO2提供选择性氧化以再生催化剂,同时产生有价值的CO副产品。这种选择性可能是相对于O2的一个优势,因为O2可能导致过度氧化。

使用CO2时Cr-MCM-41催化剂的稳定性通过其能够反复再生得到证明,这与Cr/Cab-O-Sil催化剂不同。这表明CO2在该体系中能够实现稳定的催化性能。
