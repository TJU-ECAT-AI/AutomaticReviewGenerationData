[1] "CO2 was found to enhance the dehydrogenation of propane2 or ethane3 over silica supported chromium oxide."

[2] "It was clearly observed that CO was selectively produced from CO2 during the C3H8 dehydrogenation over Cr-MCM-41."

[3] "Not only O2 but also CO2 could regenerate the Cr6+O4 tetrahedra from the reduced Cr3+O6 octahedra as suggested by the results of TPR and EXAFS."

[4] "It is concluded that during the reaction C3H8 is dehydrogenated to C3H6 by Cr6+O4 tetrahedra, which is simultaneously reduced to Cr3+O6 octahedra. The reduced Cr3+O6 octahedra is reoxidized to Cr6+O4 tetrahedra by CO2, and thus the reduction-oxidation cycle between Cr6+O4 tetrahedra and Cr3+O6 octahedra possesses an important role in the dehydrogenation of C3H8 with CO2 over Cr-MCM-41."

The literature does not directly address promoters or compare CO2 to O2 co-feeding. However, it does provide insights into how CO2 enhances catalytic performance in chromium-based systems:

CO2 enhances the dehydrogenation of propane and ethane over silica-supported chromium oxide catalysts. In the Cr-MCM-41 system, CO2 selectively produces CO during propane dehydrogenation. 

CO2 plays a crucial role in regenerating the active Cr6+ species. It reoxidizes the reduced Cr3+ octahedra back to Cr6+ tetrahedra, maintaining the catalytic cycle. This redox cycle between Cr6+ and Cr3+ is key to the dehydrogenation of propane with CO2.

While the document doesn't explicitly compare CO2 to O2, it suggests CO2 can effectively oxidize the catalyst and maintain activity. This indicates CO2 can overcome its inherent inertness in this system, likely due to the specific properties of the Cr-MCM-41 catalyst. The selective production of CO also implies CO2 activation is achieved without over-oxidation.

文献并未直接讨论助剂或将CO2与O2共进料进行比较。但是，它确实提供了关于CO2如何增强铬基催化系统性能的洞见：

CO2增强了在硅支撑的氧化铬催化剂上丙烷和乙烷的脱氢反应。在Cr-MCM-41系统中，CO2在丙烷脱氢过程中选择性地产生CO。

CO2在再生活性Cr6+物种方面起着关键作用。它将还原的Cr3+八面体重新氧化回Cr6+四面体，维持催化循环。这种Cr6+和Cr3+之间的氧化还原循环是CO2辅助丙烷脱氢的关键。

虽然文档没有明确比较CO2和O2，但它表明CO2可以有效地氧化催化剂并保持活性。这表明在这个系统中CO2可以克服其固有的惰性，这可能是由于Cr-MCM-41催化剂的特定性质。CO的选择性生成也意味着实现了CO2的活化，而没有过度氧化。
