[1] "CO2 was found to enhance the dehydrogenation of propane2 or ethane3 over silica supported chromium oxide."

[2] "It was confirmed that CO was selectively produced from CO2 in the dehydrogenation of C3H8 over Cr-MCM-41-DHT."

[3] "Not only O2 but also CO2 could regenerate the Cr6+O4 tetrahedra from the reduced Cr3+O6 octahedra as suggested by the results of TPR and EXAFS."

[4] "It is concluded that during the reaction C3H8 is dehydrogenated to C3H6 by Cr6+O4 tetrahedra, which is simultaneously reduced to Cr3+O6 octahedra. The reduced Cr3+O6 octahedra is reoxidized to Cr6+O4 tetrahedra by CO2, and thus the reduction-oxidation cycle between Cr6+O4 tetrahedra and Cr3+O6 octahedra possesses an important role in the dehydrogenation of C3H8 with CO2 over Cr-MCM-41."

The literature does not directly discuss promoters or compare CO2 to O2 co-feeding. However, it does provide insights into how CO2 functions in chromium-based catalytic systems:

CO2 enhances the dehydrogenation of propane and ethane over silica-supported chromium oxide catalysts. In the Cr-MCM-41 system, CO2 plays a crucial role in the catalytic cycle by selectively producing CO and regenerating the active Cr6+ species.

Specifically, CO2 reoxidizes the reduced Cr3+O6 octahedra back to the active Cr6+O4 tetrahedra form. This reduction-oxidation cycle between Cr6+ and Cr3+ species is key to the dehydrogenation of propane with CO2 over Cr-MCM-41.

While the document doesn't directly compare CO2 to O2, it suggests that CO2 can effectively maintain catalyst activity through this redox cycle. This indicates that CO2 can serve as an effective oxidant in this system, potentially offering advantages in terms of selectivity and stability compared to O2 co-feeding, though further research would be needed to confirm this.

这篇文献并没有直接讨论助剂或比较CO2与O2共进料。然而，它确实提供了CO2在基于铬的催化体系中如何发挥作用的见解：

CO2增强了在硅胶负载的氧化铬催化剂上丙烷和乙烷的脱氢反应。在Cr-MCM-41体系中，CO2在催化循环中扮演着至关重要的角色，选择性地产生CO并再生活性Cr6+物种。

具体来说，CO2将还原态的Cr3+O6八面体重新氧化回活性Cr6+O4四面体形式。这种Cr6+和Cr3+物种之间的还原-氧化循环是Cr-MCM-41上CO2脱氢丙烷的关键。

虽然该文档没有直接比较CO2和O2，但它表明CO2可以通过这种氧化还原循环有效地维持催化剂活性。这表明CO2可以在该体系中作为有效的氧化剂，在选择性和稳定性方面可能比O2共进料具有优势，尽管还需要进一步的研究来证实这一点。
