How do promoters address the limitations of CO2's weak oxidation potential and inertness in chromium-based catalytic systems, and what specific advantages do they offer over alternative strategies like O2 co-feeding in terms of enhancing CO2 activation, improving oxidizing ability, and achieving selective and stable catalytic performance?
