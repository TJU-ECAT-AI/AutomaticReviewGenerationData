[1] "Carbon dioxide (CO2) has been thought to be a possible substitute for oxygen. The introduction of CO2 in the catalytic dehydrogenation of propane has many potential advantages. First, thermodynamic equilibrium limitation is overcome and propylene yield is improved by removal of hydrogen (CO2 + H2 → CO + H2O); second, deep oxidation that occurred as a result of using oxygen as oxidant is avoided; third, it realizes the recycling of greenhouse gas CO2 when used as a soft oxidant."

The literature does not specifically address promoters or compare CO2 to O2 co-feeding for chromium-based catalytic systems. However, it does mention some advantages of using CO2 instead of oxygen as an oxidant in propane dehydrogenation:

1. CO2 helps overcome thermodynamic equilibrium limitations by removing hydrogen, thus improving propylene yield.

2. Using CO2 avoids deep oxidation that can occur with oxygen.

3. CO2 serves as a "soft oxidant" and allows for recycling of this greenhouse gas.

The document does not provide information on how promoters address CO2's weak oxidation potential or inertness, nor does it compare CO2 to O2 co-feeding in terms of CO2 activation, oxidizing ability, or catalytic stability and selectivity.

该文献并未具体讨论助剂或将CO2与O2共同馈入铬基催化系统进行比较。然而，它确实提到了在丙烷脱氢反应中使用CO2代替氧气作为氧化剂的一些优点：

1. CO2通过去除氢气帮助克服热力学平衡限制，从而提高丙烯产率。

2. 使用CO2可避免使用氧气时可能发生的深度氧化。

3. CO2作为"软氧化剂"，同时允许回收这种温室气体。

文献没有提供关于助剂如何解决CO2弱氧化能力和惰性的信息，也没有在CO2活化、氧化能力或催化稳定性和选择性方面将CO2与O2共同馈入进行比较。
