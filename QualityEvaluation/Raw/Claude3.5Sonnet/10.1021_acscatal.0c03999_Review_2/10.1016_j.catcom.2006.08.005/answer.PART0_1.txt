[1] "The introduction of CO2 in the catalytic dehydrogenation of propane has many potential advantages. First, thermodynamic equilibrium limitation is overcome and propylene yield is improved by removal of hydrogen (CO2 + H2 → CO + H2O); second, deep oxidation that occurred as a result of using oxygen as oxidant is avoided; third, it realizes the recycling of greenhouse gas CO2 when used as a soft oxidant."

[2] "Cr/MSU-x catalyst exhibited good activity in the ODH of ethane with CO2 according to our previous study [14]. The catalysts exhibit excellent activity in the dehydrogenation of propane with CO2."

The literature does not directly address promoters or compare CO2 to O2 co-feeding for chromium-based catalysts. However, it does highlight some advantages of using CO2 instead of oxygen in propane dehydrogenation:

1. CO2 helps overcome thermodynamic limitations by removing hydrogen, improving propylene yield.

2. CO2 avoids deep oxidation that occurs when using oxygen as an oxidant.

3. Using CO2 allows for recycling of this greenhouse gas as a soft oxidant.

The study shows that chromium catalysts supported on mesoporous silica (Cr/MSU-x) exhibit excellent activity for propane dehydrogenation with CO2, but does not discuss specific promoters or compare to O2 co-feeding strategies.

该文献并未直接讨论助剂或比较铬基催化剂中CO2与O2共进料的情况。但是，它确实强调了在丙烷脱氢反应中使用CO2而非氧气的一些优点：

1. CO2通过去除氢气帮助克服热力学限制，提高丙烯产率。

2. CO2避免了使用氧气作为氧化剂时发生的深度氧化。

3. 使用CO2允许将这种温室气体作为温和氧化剂进行回收利用。

研究表明，以介孔二氧化硅为载体的铬催化剂(Cr/MSU-x)在CO2存在下的丙烷脱氢反应中表现出优异的活性，但未讨论具体的助剂或与O2共进料策略进行比较。
