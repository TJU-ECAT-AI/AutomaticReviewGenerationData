[1] "Carbon dioxide (CO2) has been thought to be a possible substitute for oxygen. The introduction of CO2 in the catalytic dehydrogenation of propane has many potential advantages."

[2] "First, thermodynamic equilibrium limitation is overcome and propylene yield is improved by removal of hydrogen (CO2 + H2 → CO + H2O); second, deep oxidation that occurred as a result of using oxygen as oxidant is avoided; third, it realizes the recycling of greenhouse gas CO2 when used as a soft oxidant."

The literature does not directly address the use of promoters or compare CO2 to O2 co-feeding in chromium-based catalytic systems. However, it does highlight some advantages of using CO2 instead of oxygen in propane dehydrogenation:

1. CO2 helps overcome thermodynamic equilibrium limitations by removing hydrogen, which improves propylene yield.

2. Using CO2 avoids the deep oxidation that can occur when using oxygen as an oxidant.

3. CO2 acts as a "soft oxidant" and allows for recycling of this greenhouse gas.

The literature does not provide information on how promoters specifically enhance CO2 activation or improve oxidizing ability in chromium-based systems. More research would be needed to fully answer the question about promoters and compare CO2 to O2 co-feeding strategies.

文献并未直接讨论在铬基催化系统中使用促进剂或将CO2与O2共进料进行比较。然而，它确实强调了在丙烷脱氢中使用CO2而非氧气的一些优势：

1. CO2通过去除氢气来帮助克服热力学平衡限制，从而提高丙烯产率。

2. 使用CO2可以避免使用氧气作为氧化剂时可能发生的深度氧化。

3. CO2作为"软氧化剂"，允许回收这种温室气体。

文献没有提供关于促进剂如何具体增强CO2活化或改善铬基系统氧化能力的信息。需要更多研究才能充分回答关于促进剂的问题，并比较CO2和O2共进料策略。
