<EnglishVersionAnswer>

The given literature does not contain any information about chromium-based catalytic systems or the use of promoters to address limitations of CO2's weak oxidation potential and inertness in such systems. The text focuses on copper-based catalysts promoted with potassium and barium for CO2 hydrogenation, and does not discuss chromium catalysts, O2 co-feeding, or strategies for enhancing CO2 activation in chromium systems. Therefore, this question cannot be answered based on the provided document.

<ChineseVersionAnswer>

给定的文献中没有包含任何关于铬基催化体系或使用助剂来解决CO2弱氧化能力和惰性问题的信息。该文本主要讨论了用钾和钡促进的铜基催化剂用于CO2加氢,并未涉及铬催化剂、O2共进料或增强铬系统中CO2活化的策略。因此,无法根据提供的文档回答这个问题。
