Chromium-based catalytic systems have garnered significant attention in recent years due to their potential for enhancing CO2 activation and oxidizing ability. However, these systems face several challenges, including limited catalytic activity, poor selectivity, and rapid deactivation. To address these issues, researchers have employed various strategies, such as optimizing catalyst composition, engineering surface structures, and controlling reaction conditions. One particularly promising approach involves the use of promoters, which are additives that can significantly improve the performance and selectivity of chromium-based catalysts. These promoters work by modifying the electronic properties of the catalyst, creating synergistic effects, or altering the surface chemistry to facilitate CO2 adsorption and activation. As a result, the incorporation of carefully selected promoters can lead to enhanced catalytic activity, improved product yields, and increased stability of the catalytic system. Ongoing research in this field aims to identify novel promoters and elucidate their precise mechanisms of action, ultimately paving the way for more efficient and sustainable CO2 utilization processes in industrial applications.

Enhancing CO2 activation and oxidizing ability in chromium-based catalytic systems: Challenges, strategies, and the role of promoters in improving performance and selectivity

Carbon dioxide (CO2) has emerged as a promising alternative oxidant for catalytic oxidative dehydrogenation of light alkanes to olefins, particularly in chromium-based catalytic systems. However, CO2's weak oxidation potential and inertness present significant challenges that need to be addressed to achieve selective and stable catalytic performance. This review focuses on the strategies employed to overcome these limitations, with particular emphasis on the role of promoters in enhancing CO2 activation and oxidizing ability.

Challenges of using CO2 as an oxidant:
1. Weak oxidation potential: CO2 has limited oxidizing ability in terms of reoxidation of reduced CrOx species due to its thermodynamically stable properties [10.1002/cctc.201200397].
2. Inertness: CO2 is quite inert and not easily activated by CrOx [10.1021/acscatal.0c03999\_2].
3. Competitive adsorption: CO2 can competitively adsorb on the catalyst surface, particularly on basic sites, potentially negatively affecting performance [10.1021/cr5002436].

Strategies to enhance CO2 activation and oxidizing ability:
1. Promoters: The introduction of promoters is a key strategy to facilitate CO2 activation on Cr2O3 catalysts and improve its oxidizing ability for selective and stable performance [10.1021/acscatal.0c03999\_2].

2. Redox cycle mechanisms: In CrOx/MCM-41 catalysts, the reverse water-gas shift (RWGS) reaction proceeds via a redox cycle, where hydrogen from propane dehydrogenation reduces Cr3+ to Cr2+, which is then reoxidized by CO2 [10.1007/s11144-007-5089-1].

3. Support effects: Using supports like silica that promote deep reduction of chromium to Cr2+, especially at low chromium loadings, allows CO2 to more easily reoxidize the chromium [10.1007/s11144-007-5089-1].

4. Low chromium content: Catalysts with low chromium content promote deeper reduction to Cr2+ species, which are more easily reoxidized by CO2 than Cr3+ [10.1007/s11144-007-5089-1].

Role of promoters in improving performance and selectivity:
1. Ni-based promoters:
   a. Enhanced CO2 activation: Ni has an excellent ability to activate CO2, even under harsh reaction conditions [10.1002/cctc.201200397].
   b. Improved oxidizing ability: Ni enhances the oxidizing ability of CO2, allowing it to reoxidize reduced Cr2+ to the active Cr3+ state and further to Cr6+ [10.1002/cctc.201200397].
   c. CO2 dissociation: Ni facilitates CO2 dissociation to CO and an adsorbed O* next to the Ni site, which can subsequently regenerate Cr3+ via reoxidation [10.1021/acscatal.0c03999\_2].
   d. Stable selectivity and activity: Ni-promoted catalysts maintain stable selectivity and catalytic activity while improving performance [10.1002/cctc.201200397].

2. Alkali metal oxide promoters:
   a. CO2 adsorption and activation: Due to their basic properties, alkali metal oxides promote CO2 adsorption and activation in CO2 hydrogenation reactions [10.1021/acscatal.0c03999\_2].
   b. Increased stability and selectivity: Potassium, in particular, has been shown to increase the stability and selectivity of chromium oxide catalysts [10.3103/S0361521912010089].

3. Ru promoters:
   Ru serves as a potential promoter due to its high activity in CO2 hydrogenation, which can enhance the overall reaction process [10.1021/acscatal.0c03999\_2].

Advantages of promoter-enhanced CO2 activation over O2 co-feeding:
1. Higher selectivity: CO2 with promoters allows for higher selectivity compared to using O2 as an oxidizing agent [10.3103/S0361521912010089].
2. Improved stability: Promoted catalysts show improved stability over longer periods compared to O2 co-feeding [10.3103/S0361521912010089].
3. More controlled oxidation: CO2 provides a milder oxidizing environment compared to O2, allowing for better control of the reaction when combined with promoters [10.3103/S0361521912010089].
4. Prevention of deep oxidation: The lower oxidizing activity of CO2 shifts the ODH reaction toward more olefin production by preventing deep oxidation of reactive olefins [10.1016/j.jcat.2019.02.026].
5. Coke inhibition: CO2 can inhibit coke formation and stabilize the catalyst through the reverse Boudouard reaction [10.1016/j.jcat.2019.02.026].

In conclusion, the use of promoters in chromium-based catalytic systems offers a promising approach to enhance CO2 activation and oxidizing ability while maintaining selectivity and stability. By carefully selecting and optimizing promoters, researchers can overcome the limitations of CO2's weak oxidation potential and inertness, leading to more efficient and sustainable catalytic processes for the oxidative dehydrogenation of light alkanes.



Integrative understanding and prospective outlook: The development of promoters for enhancing CO2 activation in chromium-based catalytic systems represents a significant step towards more sustainable and efficient catalytic processes. While current research has focused primarily on Ni, alkali metal oxides, and Ru as promoters, future investigations could explore novel combinations of promoters or entirely new classes of materials to further improve CO2 activation and oxidizing ability.

One promising direction for future research could be the development of multi-functional promoters that can simultaneously enhance CO2 activation, improve oxidizing ability, and resist coke formation. This could potentially be achieved through the design of nanostructured promoters with tailored electronic and structural properties.

Another avenue for exploration could be the integration of advanced characterization techniques, such as operando spectroscopy and in situ electron microscopy, to gain deeper insights into the mechanisms of CO2 activation and the role of promoters under reaction conditions. This could lead to the rational design of more effective catalytic systems.

Furthermore, the concept of using CO2 as a mild oxidant with promoters could be extended to other catalytic systems beyond chromium-based catalysts, potentially opening up new possibilities for CO2 utilization in various chemical processes. This could contribute to the broader goal of developing a more circular carbon economy.

Lastly, future research could focus on scaling up these promoted catalytic systems for industrial applications, addressing challenges related to long-term stability, regeneration strategies, and process integration. This would be crucial for realizing the full potential of CO2 as an alternative oxidant in large-scale chemical production.
