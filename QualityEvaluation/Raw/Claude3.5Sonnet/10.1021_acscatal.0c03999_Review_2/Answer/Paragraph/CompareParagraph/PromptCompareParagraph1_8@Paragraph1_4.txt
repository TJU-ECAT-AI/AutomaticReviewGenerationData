Enhancing CO2 activation and oxidizing ability in chromium-based catalytic systems: Challenges, strategies, and the role of promoters in improving performance and selectivity

Carbon dioxide (CO2) has emerged as a promising alternative oxidant for catalytic oxidative dehydrogenation of light alkanes to olefins, offering several advantages over conventional oxygen-based systems. However, CO2's weak oxidation potential and inertness pose significant challenges in chromium-based catalytic systems. This review focuses on the strategies employed to overcome these limitations, with particular emphasis on the role of promoters in enhancing CO2 activation, improving oxidizing ability, and achieving selective and stable catalytic performance.

Challenges of CO2 as an oxidant:
CO2 has limited oxidizing ability in terms of reoxidation of reduced CrOx species due to its thermodynamically stable properties [10.1002/cctc.201200397]. It is quite inert and not easily activated by CrOx [10.1021/acscatal.0c03999\_2]. The efficiency of reoxidation by CO2 is much lower than that by oxygen [10.1007/s11144-007-5089-1].

Strategies to enhance CO2 activation and oxidizing ability:

1. Promoter addition:
Various promoters have been investigated to facilitate CO2 activation and improve its oxidizing ability in chromium-based catalysts:

a) Nickel (Ni): Ni-based promoters have shown excellent ability to activate CO2, even under harsh reaction conditions [10.1002/cctc.201200397]. Ni enhances the oxidizing ability of CO2 to reoxidize reduced Cr2+ to the active Cr3+ state and further to Cr6+ [10.1002/cctc.201200397]. It facilitates CO2 dissociation to CO and an adsorbed O*, which can subsequently regenerate Cr3+ via reoxidation [10.1021/acscatal.0c03999\_2].

b) Alkali metal oxides: Due to their basic properties, alkali metal oxides promote CO2 adsorption and activation in CO2 hydrogenation reactions [10.1021/acscatal.0c03999\_2]. Potassium (K) has been identified as an effective promoter, with optimum content ranging from 0.2-0.4% in 5% CrOx/SiO2 catalysts [10.3103/S0361521912010089].

c) Ruthenium (Ru): Ru is a potential promoter due to its high activity in CO2 hydrogenation [10.1021/acscatal.0c03999\_2].

2. Support effects:
The choice of support plays a crucial role in enhancing CO2 activation:

a) Silica support: CO2 exerts promoting effects only on SiO2-supported Cr2O3 catalysts [10.1016/S0167-2991(98)80785-4]. The boundaries between Cr2O3 and SiO2 particles have an important role in the promoting effect of CO2 [10.1016/S0167-2991(98)80785-4].

b) Mesoporous supports: Cr/MSU-x catalysts exhibit excellent activity in the dehydrogenation of propane with CO2 [10.1016/j.catcom.2006.08.005].

3. Redox cycle mechanisms:
Leveraging redox cycles can improve CO2 activation and oxidizing ability:

a) Cr6+/Cr3+ cycle: During the reaction, C3H8 is dehydrogenated to C3H6 by Cr6+O4 tetrahedra, which is simultaneously reduced to Cr3+O6 octahedra. The reduced Cr3+O6 octahedra are then reoxidized to Cr6+O4 tetrahedra by CO2 [10.1016/S0167-2991(04)80271-4].

b) Cr3+/Cr2+ cycle: Hydrogen formed in the dehydrogenation of propane reduces Cr3+ to Cr2+ species, which are then reoxidized by CO2 [10.1007/s11144-007-5089-1].

Advantages of CO2 with promoters over O2 co-feeding:

1. Improved selectivity: CO2, being a milder oxidant, shifts the reaction towards more olefin production by preventing deep oxidation of reactive olefins [10.1016/j.jcat.2019.02.026]. This is in contrast to O2 co-feeding, which can significantly decrease selectivity for propylene [10.1002/cctc.201200397].

2. Enhanced stability: Promoters like K and Ni have been shown to increase the stability of chromium oxide catalysts, allowing for longer catalyst lifetimes and sustained performance over extended periods [10.3103/S0361521912010089] [10.1002/cctc.201200397].

3. Coke inhibition: CO2 primarily inhibits coke formation rather than eliminating existing coke [10.1016/j.jcat.2019.02.026]. This is advantageous over O2 co-feeding, which can lead to faster deactivation due to coke formation [10.3103/S0361521912010089].

4. Controlled oxidation: CO2 provides a milder oxidizing environment compared to O2, allowing for better control of the reaction when combined with promoters [10.3103/S0361521912010089].

5. Environmental benefits: CO2 utilization in this process can be environmentally beneficial, especially when using CO2 from waste gases [10.3103/S0361521912010089].


Integrative understanding and prospective outlook:

The development of promoters for enhancing CO2 activation and oxidizing ability in chromium-based catalytic systems has shown significant promise in addressing the limitations of CO2 as an oxidant. The synergistic effects of promoters, support materials, and redox cycle mechanisms have demonstrated the potential to achieve selective and stable catalytic performance in propane dehydrogenation reactions.

Future research directions may focus on:

1. Rational design of multi-functional promoters: Combining the strengths of different promoters (e.g., Ni for CO2 activation, K for stability) could lead to more efficient catalytic systems.

2. In-depth mechanistic studies: Advanced in-situ characterization techniques could provide deeper insights into the role of promoters in CO2 activation and the redox cycles of chromium species.

3. Novel support materials: Exploration of new support materials or hierarchical structures could further enhance CO2 activation and catalyst stability.

4. Process intensification: Integration of membrane technology or microreactor systems could optimize CO2 utilization and product separation.

5. Computational modeling: Advanced modeling techniques could guide the design of more effective promoter-catalyst combinations and predict their performance under various reaction conditions.

6. Sustainable catalyst design: Developing catalysts with lower chromium content or exploring alternative active metals could address environmental concerns while maintaining high performance.

By addressing these research directions, the field of CO2-mediated propane dehydrogenation could move towards more efficient, selective, and environmentally friendly processes, potentially revolutionizing the production of light olefins.

Enhancing CO2 activation and oxidizing ability in chromium-based catalytic systems: Challenges, strategies, and the role of promoters in improving performance and selectivity

Carbon dioxide (CO2) has emerged as a promising alternative oxidant for catalytic oxidative dehydrogenation of light alkanes to olefins, particularly in chromium-based catalytic systems. However, CO2's weak oxidation potential and inertness present significant challenges that need to be addressed to achieve optimal catalytic performance. This review focuses on the strategies employed to overcome these limitations, with particular emphasis on the role of promoters in enhancing CO2 activation, improving oxidizing ability, and achieving selective and stable catalytic performance.

Challenges of CO2 as an Oxidant:
CO2 has limited oxidizing ability due to its thermodynamically stable properties, making it difficult to reoxidize reduced CrOx species [10.1002/cctc.201200397]. Additionally, CO2 is quite inert and not easily activated by CrOx [10.1021/acscatal.0c03999\_2]. These limitations result in lower efficiency of reoxidation compared to oxygen [10.1007/s11144-007-5089-1].

Strategies to Enhance CO2 Activation and Oxidizing Ability:

1. Promoter Addition:
The introduction of promoters is a key strategy to facilitate CO2 activation and improve its oxidizing ability [10.1021/acscatal.0c03999\_2]. Several types of promoters have been investigated:

a) Nickel (Ni):
Ni has shown excellent ability to activate CO2, even under harsh reaction conditions [10.1002/cctc.201200397]. It enhances the oxidizing ability of CO2 by facilitating its dissociation to CO and adsorbed O*, which can then regenerate reduced chromium species [10.1002/cctc.201200397]. Ni-promoted catalysts demonstrate higher CO2 conversion rates and stable propylene production [10.1002/cctc.201200397].

b) Alkali Metal Oxides:
Due to their basic properties, alkali metal oxides promote CO2 adsorption and activation in CO2 hydrogenation reactions [10.1021/acscatal.0c03999\_2]. Potassium (K) has been identified as an effective promoter, enhancing catalyst stability and selectivity [10.3103/S0361521912010089].

c) Ruthenium (Ru):
Ru is a potential promoter due to its high activity in CO2 hydrogenation, which can enhance the overall reaction process [10.1021/acscatal.0c03999\_2].

2. Support Effects:
The choice of support material plays a crucial role in enhancing CO2 activation. Silica supports, especially at low chromium loadings, promote deep reduction of chromium to Cr2+, which is more easily reoxidized by CO2 than Cr3+ [10.1007/s11144-007-5089-1].

3. Redox Cycle Mechanism:
In some chromium-based catalysts, such as CrOx/MCM-41, the reverse water-gas shift (RWGS) reaction proceeds via a redox cycle. This cycle involves the reduction of Cr3+ to Cr2+ by hydrogen from propane dehydrogenation, followed by reoxidation of Cr2+ by CO2 [10.1007/s11144-007-5089-1].

Advantages over O2 Co-feeding:

1. Improved Selectivity:
CO2, being a milder oxidant compared to O2, shifts the oxidative dehydrogenation reaction towards more olefin production by preventing deep oxidation of reactive olefins [10.1016/j.jcat.2019.02.026]. This results in higher selectivity for the desired products.

2. Stable Catalytic Performance:
Promoters like Ni and K help maintain stable catalytic activity and selectivity over extended periods, unlike O2 co-feeding which can lead to significant selectivity drops [10.1002/cctc.201200397] [10.3103/S0361521912010089].

3. Reduced Coke Formation:
CO2 can inhibit coke formation and, in some cases, gasify existing coke through the reverse Boudouard reaction [10.1016/j.jcat.2019.02.026]. This helps in maintaining catalyst stability and prolonging catalyst lifetime.

4. Thermodynamic Equilibrium Shift:
CO2 consumes hydrogen species through the RWGS reaction, which enhances the equilibrium of light alkane conversion [10.1016/j.jcat.2019.02.026].

5. Prevention of Over-oxidation:
CO2 prevents the over-reduction of active oxidative chromium species by consuming excess hydrogen, maintaining the catalyst in its active state [10.1016/j.jcat.2019.02.026].


Integrative understanding and prospective outlook:
The development of promoters to enhance CO2 activation and oxidizing ability in chromium-based catalytic systems represents a significant advancement in the field of oxidative dehydrogenation of light alkanes. The use of CO2 as an oxidant, coupled with carefully selected promoters, offers a more sustainable and selective approach compared to traditional O2-based systems.

Future research directions may include:

1. Exploration of novel promoter combinations: Investigating synergistic effects between different promoters (e.g., Ni-K or Ru-Ni combinations) could lead to further improvements in catalyst performance and stability.

2. In-depth mechanistic studies: Advanced characterization techniques could be employed to elucidate the precise mechanisms by which promoters enhance CO2 activation and influence the catalyst's redox properties.

3. Optimization of support materials: Development of new support materials or modification of existing ones to further enhance CO2 activation and promote the desired redox cycles.

4. Process intensification: Integration of membrane technology or other separation techniques to continuously remove products and shift equilibrium, potentially leading to higher conversions and yields.

5. Computational modeling: Utilizing density functional theory (DFT) and other computational methods to predict and design optimal promoter-catalyst combinations for specific reactions.

6. Scale-up studies: Investigating the performance of promoted catalysts under industrially relevant conditions to address potential challenges in large-scale applications.

7. Life cycle assessment: Conducting comprehensive environmental impact studies to quantify the potential benefits of CO2-based oxidative dehydrogenation processes compared to conventional methods.

By pursuing these research directions, it may be possible to develop even more efficient and sustainable catalytic systems for the production of valuable olefins from light alkanes, while simultaneously contributing to CO2 utilization efforts.
