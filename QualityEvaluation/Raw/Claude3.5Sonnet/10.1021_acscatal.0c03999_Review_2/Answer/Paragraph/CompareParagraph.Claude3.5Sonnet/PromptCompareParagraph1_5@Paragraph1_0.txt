Enhancing CO2 activation and oxidizing ability in chromium-based catalytic systems: Challenges, strategies, and the role of promoters in improving performance and selectivity

Carbon dioxide (CO2) has emerged as a promising alternative oxidant for catalytic oxidative dehydrogenation of light alkanes to olefins, offering several advantages over conventional oxygen-based systems. However, CO2's weak oxidation potential and inertness present significant challenges in chromium-based catalytic systems. This review explores the strategies employed to address these limitations, with a focus on the role of promoters in enhancing CO2 activation, improving oxidizing ability, and achieving selective and stable catalytic performance.

Challenges of CO2 as an Oxidant:
CO2 has limited oxidizing ability in terms of reoxidation of reduced CrOx species due to its thermodynamically stable properties [10.1002/cctc.201200397]. Its oxidation potential is rather weak, and it is not easily activated by CrOx [10.1021/acscatal.0c03999\_2]. The efficiency of reoxidation by CO2 is much lower than that by oxygen [10.1007/s11144-007-5089-1].

Strategies to Overcome CO2 Limitations:
1. Redox Cycle Mechanism: In CrOx/MCM-41 catalysts, the reverse water-gas shift (RWGS) reaction proceeds via a redox cycle. Hydrogen from propane dehydrogenation reduces Cr3+ to Cr2+, which is then reoxidized by CO2 [10.1007/s11144-007-5089-1].

2. Support Effect: Using supports like silica that promote deep reduction of chromium to Cr2+, especially at low chromium loadings, allows CO2 to more easily reoxidize the chromium [10.1007/s11144-007-5089-1].

3. Low Chromium Content: Catalysts with low chromium content promote deeper reduction to Cr2+ species, which are more easily reoxidized by CO2 than Cr3+ [10.1007/s11144-007-5089-1].

4. Promoter Introduction: The development of suitable promoters to activate CO2, enhance its oxidizing ability, and maintain stable selectivity for propylene is highly desirable [10.1002/cctc.201200397].

Role of Promoters:
Various promoters have been investigated to enhance CO2 activation and improve its oxidizing ability in chromium-based catalytic systems:

1. Nickel (Ni):
Ni-based promoters offer several advantages:
- Enhanced CO2 activation: Ni has an excellent ability to activate CO2, even under harsh reaction conditions [10.1002/cctc.201200397].
- Improved oxidizing ability: Ni enhances the oxidizing ability of CO2 to reoxidize reduced Cr2+ to the active Cr3+ state and further to Cr6+ [10.1002/cctc.201200397].
- CO2 dissociation: Ni dissociates CO2 to CO and O*ads, which regenerates the reduced Cr species Cr2+ to Cr3+ through reoxidation [10.1002/cctc.201200397].
- Stable catalytic activity: Ni-promoted catalysts show decreased deactivation rates compared to unpromoted catalysts [10.1002/cctc.201200397].

2. Alkali Metal Oxides:
- CO2 adsorption and activation: Due to their basic properties, alkali metal oxides promote CO2 adsorption and activation in CO2 hydrogenation reactions [10.1021/acscatal.0c03999\_2].
- Improved stability: Potassium (K) has been shown to increase the stability of chromium oxide catalysts [10.3103/S0361521912010089].

3. Ruthenium (Ru):
- Enhanced CO2 hydrogenation: Ru serves as a potential promoter due to its high activity in CO2 hydrogenation [10.1021/acscatal.0c03999\_2].

Advantages over O2 Co-feeding:
1. Selective oxidation: CO2 has lower oxidizing activity than O2, which shifts the reaction towards more olefin production by preventing deep oxidation of reactive olefins [10.1016/j.jcat.2019.02.026].
2. Stable selectivity: Unlike O2 co-feeding, which can significantly decrease selectivity for propylene, promoted CO2 systems maintain stable selectivity while improving catalytic performance [10.1002/cctc.201200397].
3. Coke inhibition: CO2 inhibits coke formation rather than eliminating existing coke, which can be beneficial for catalyst stability [10.1016/j.jcat.2019.02.026].
4. Equilibrium enhancement: CO2 consumes hydrogen species through the reverse water-gas shift (RWGS) reaction, enhancing the equilibrium of light alkane conversion [10.1016/j.jcat.2019.02.026].
5. Prevention of over-reduction: CO2 prevents the over-reduction of active oxidative chromium species by consuming excess hydrogen [10.1016/j.jcat.2019.02.026].


Integrative understanding and prospective outlook:
The development of promoters for enhancing CO2 activation and oxidizing ability in chromium-based catalytic systems represents a significant advancement in the field of oxidative dehydrogenation of light alkanes. By addressing the inherent limitations of CO2 as an oxidant, these promoters offer a more balanced approach to catalyst design, potentially leading to more efficient and environmentally friendly processes.

Future research directions may include:

1. Exploration of novel promoter combinations: Investigating synergistic effects between different promoters (e.g., Ni-K or Ru-Ni combinations) could lead to further improvements in catalytic performance and stability.

2. In-depth mechanistic studies: Advanced spectroscopic techniques could be employed to elucidate the precise mechanisms by which promoters enhance CO2 activation and oxidation, providing insights for rational catalyst design.

3. Catalyst support engineering: Developing new support materials or modifying existing ones to work synergistically with promoters could further enhance CO2 activation and catalyst stability.

4. Process optimization: Integrating promoted catalysts into innovative reactor designs or exploring alternative process conditions could maximize the benefits of enhanced CO2 activation.

5. Sustainability assessment: Comprehensive life cycle analyses of promoted catalyst systems could quantify their environmental benefits compared to traditional O2-based processes.

6. Scale-up studies: Investigating the performance of promoted catalysts at pilot and industrial scales will be crucial for their practical implementation.

By pursuing these research directions, the scientific community can work towards developing more efficient, selective, and sustainable catalytic systems for the valorization of CO2 in chemical production processes.

Promoters play a crucial role in addressing the limitations of CO2's weak oxidation potential and inertness in chromium-based catalytic systems for propane dehydrogenation. They enhance CO2 activation and improve its oxidizing ability, offering several advantages over alternative strategies like O2 co-feeding:

1. Enhanced CO2 activation: Promoters like Ni and Ru have excellent ability to activate CO2, even under harsh reaction conditions. Ni, for instance, dissociates CO2 into CO and activated oxygen (O*ads), which can then regenerate reduced chromium species [10.1002/cctc.201200397]. This overcomes CO2's inherent inertness and low reactivity with CrOx [10.1021/acscatal.0c03999\_2].

2. Improved oxidizing ability: Promoters enhance the oxidizing ability of CO2, allowing it to reoxidize reduced Cr2+ to the active Cr3+ state and further to Cr6+ [10.1002/cctc.201200397]. This helps maintain the active sites of the catalyst and addresses the limitation of CO2's weak oxidation potential.

3. Stable selectivity: Unlike O2 co-feeding, which can significantly decrease selectivity for propylene, promoter-enhanced CO2 systems maintain stable selectivity while improving catalytic performance [10.3103/S0361521912010089]. For example, optimum potassium content in CrOx/SiO2 catalysts resulted in 100% selectivity for propene formation at 22% propane conversion.

4. Reduced deactivation: Promoter-enhanced catalysts show decreased deactivation rates compared to unpromoted catalysts, leading to more stable catalytic activity over time [10.1002/cctc.201200397]. This is particularly important for maintaining long-term catalyst performance.

5. Higher CO2 conversion: Promoted catalysts demonstrate higher CO2 conversion rates, indicating more efficient use of the CO2 reactant [10.1002/cctc.201200397].

6. Coke suppression: The introduction of CO2 as an oxidizing agent, coupled with promoters, helps decrease coke deposition on the catalyst surface [10.3103/S0361521912010089]. This is crucial for maintaining catalyst activity and stability.

7. Thermodynamic equilibrium shift: Promoters help shift the thermodynamic equilibrium of the dehydrogenation reaction towards olefin formation by facilitating CO2's interaction with hydrogen [10.3103/S0361521912010089].

8. Tuning of catalyst properties: Promoters can modify the surface properties of the catalyst, such as redox potential and surface acidity, allowing for fine-tuning of catalytic performance [10.1021/acscatal.0c03999\_2].

Compared to O2 co-feeding, CO2 with promoters offers several key advantages:

1. Higher selectivity: CO2 is less likely to cause deep oxidation of paraffins and olefins compared to O2 [10.1016/j.catcom.2006.08.005].

2. Better stability: Catalysts promoted with alkali metals like potassium show improved stability over longer periods [10.3103/S0361521912010089].

3. More controlled oxidation: CO2 provides a milder oxidizing environment compared to O2, allowing for better control of the reaction when combined with promoters [10.1016/j.jcat.2019.02.026].

4. Improved catalyst lifetime: By reducing coke formation, promoters help extend catalyst life compared to O2 co-feeding, which can lead to faster deactivation [10.3103/S0361521912010089].

5. Environmental benefits: CO2 utilization in this process can be environmentally beneficial, especially when using CO2 from waste gases [10.1016/j.catcom.2006.08.005].


Integrative understanding and prospective outlook: The use of promoters in CO2-based chromium catalytic systems for propane dehydrogenation represents a significant advancement in addressing the limitations of CO2 as an oxidant. This approach not only enhances the catalytic performance but also offers environmental benefits through CO2 utilization. 

Future research directions may focus on:

1. Developing novel multi-functional promoters that can simultaneously enhance CO2 activation, improve oxidizing ability, and suppress coke formation.

2. Investigating the synergistic effects of combining different types of promoters (e.g., alkali metals with transition metals) to further optimize catalyst performance.

3. Exploring the potential of advanced characterization techniques to gain deeper insights into the mechanistic role of promoters in CO2 activation and chromium redox cycles.

4. Studying the long-term stability and regeneration of promoted catalysts under industrial-like conditions to assess their viability for large-scale applications.

5. Investigating the potential of promoter-enhanced CO2-based systems for other dehydrogenation reactions or related processes, expanding the scope of this approach beyond propane dehydrogenation.

6. Developing strategies to integrate these catalytic systems with CO2 capture technologies, creating a more sustainable and circular approach to olefin production.

These research directions could lead to the development of more efficient and environmentally friendly catalytic processes for olefin production, contributing to the broader goals of CO2 utilization and sustainable chemical manufacturing.
