          [1] "CO2 has been proposed to participate in the redox cycles of Cr2+  Cr3+ (59,64) or Cr3+  Cr6+; (56,80,91) however, its oxidation potential is rather weak. Besides, CO2 is quite inert and not easily activated by CrOx."

[2] "The addition of O2 in the reactants as a co-feed with CO2 has been initially proposed to overcome these issues, yet the selectivity drops."

[3] "An alternative is to introduce promoters to facilitate CO2 activation on the Cr2O3 catalysts and to improve its oxidizing ability for selective and stable performance."

[4] "Because of their basic property, alkali metal oxides have been widely used as promoters for CO2 adsorption and activation in CO2 hydrogenation reactions."

[5] "Ru is a potential promoter because of its high activity in CO2 hydrogenation."

[6] "Ni is also a potential candidate because of its activity in CO2 activation for CO2 reforming reactions (96,97) and RWGS."

[7] "The major role of Ni is to facilitate CO2 dissociation to CO and an adsorbed O* next to the Ni site, which can subsequently regenerate Cr3+ via reoxidation."

          Promoters address the limitations of CO2's weak oxidation potential and inertness in chromium-based catalytic systems by facilitating CO2 activation and improving its oxidizing ability. They offer several advantages over O2 co-feeding:

1. Selectivity: While O2 co-feeding can overcome CO2's limitations, it leads to a drop in selectivity. Promoters, on the other hand, can enhance CO2 activation while maintaining or improving selectivity.

2. CO2 Adsorption and Activation: Alkali metal oxides, due to their basic properties, promote CO2 adsorption and activation in CO2 hydrogenation reactions. This helps overcome CO2's inertness.

3. Improved Hydrogenation: Ru serves as a potential promoter due to its high activity in CO2 hydrogenation, which can enhance the overall reaction process.

4. Enhanced CO2 Dissociation: Ni promotes CO2 activation for reforming reactions and water-gas shift reactions. It facilitates CO2 dissociation to CO and adsorbed O*, which can then regenerate Cr3+ through reoxidation.

5. Stability: Some promoters, like K in alkali metal oxides, can improve the stability of C3H6 yield.

6. Balanced Reactivity: Proper amounts of promoters like Ru can optimize activity and selectivity by balancing reactions such as RWGS and C3H6 reforming.

7. Tuning of Catalyst Properties: Promoters can modify the surface properties of the catalyst, such as redox potential and surface acidity, allowing for fine-tuning of catalytic performance.

By introducing these promoters, the catalytic system can achieve more selective and stable performance compared to O2 co-feeding, while effectively addressing CO2's weak oxidation potential and inertness.

          促进剂通过促进CO2的活化和提高其氧化能力来解决铬基催化系统中CO2氧化势弱和惰性的限制。与O2共进料相比，它们提供了几个优势：

1. 选择性：虽然O2共进料可以克服CO2的局限性，但会导致选择性下降。相比之下，促进剂可以增强CO2的活化，同时保持或提高选择性。

2. CO2吸附和活化：碱金属氧化物由于其碱性特性，促进了CO2氢化反应中的CO2吸附和活化。这有助于克服CO2的惰性。

3. 改善氢化：由于Ru在CO2氢化中具有高活性，它可以作为潜在的促进剂，增强整体反应过程。

4. 增强CO2解离：Ni促进了CO2在重整反应和水煤气变换反应中的活化。它促进CO2解离为CO和吸附的O*，后者可以通过再氧化重新生成Cr3+。

5. 稳定性：一些促进剂，如碱金属氧化物中的K，可以提高C3H6产率的稳定性。

6. 平衡反应性：适量的促进剂（如Ru）可以通过平衡RWGS和C3H6重整等反应来优化活性和选择性。

7. 调节催化剂性质：促进剂可以修改催化剂的表面性质，如氧化还原电位和表面酸度，从而可以精细调节催化性能。

通过引入这些促进剂，催化系统可以实现比O2共进料更具选择性和稳定性的性能，同时有效解决CO2氧化势弱和惰性的问题。
