          [1] "The DRS results obtained during the regeneration of the reduced CrOx/SiO2 catalyst show that CO2 is a very weak oxidant and that the efficiency of reoxidation by CO2 is much lower than that by oxygen."

          [2] "Recently, Ohishi et al. [12] have proposed that over the CrOx/MCM-41 catalyst, the RWGS reaction can proceed via a redox cycle."

          [3] "According to this mechanism, hydrogen formed in the dehydrogenation of propane reduces Cr3+ to Cr2+ species (1), which in the next step are reoxidized by CO2 (2)."

          [4] "On the surface of silica, a deep reduction of chromium species to Cr2+ is promoted especially at low Cr content, where the migration of Cr3+ species to form the stable Cr2O3 clusters is slow and further reduction of Cr3+ to Cr2+ species can continue."

          The literature does not directly address promoters or compare CO2 activation strategies to O2 co-feeding for chromium-based catalysts. However, it discusses some mechanisms to address CO2's weak oxidation potential in these systems:

          1. Redox cycle mechanism: In CrOx/MCM-41 catalysts, the reverse water-gas shift (RWGS) reaction proceeds via a redox cycle. Hydrogen from propane dehydrogenation reduces Cr3+ to Cr2+, which is then reoxidized by CO2. This allows CO2 to be activated indirectly.

          2. Support effect: Using supports like silica that promote deep reduction of chromium to Cr2+, especially at low chromium loadings, allows CO2 to more easily reoxidize the chromium.

          3. Low chromium content: Catalysts with low chromium content promote deeper reduction to Cr2+ species, which are more easily reoxidized by CO2 than Cr3+. This is because low Cr content prevents formation of stable Cr2O3 clusters resistant to further reduction/oxidation.

          4. Bi-functional nature: While not explicitly stated, the bi-functional nature of catalysts like CrOx/SiO2 (active for both dehydrogenation and RWGS) likely contributes to improved performance with CO2 compared to inert atmospheres.

          These strategies aim to improve CO2 activation and oxidizing ability compared to direct oxidation of Cr3+ by CO2, which was found to be ineffective. However, the document does not provide information on how these approaches compare to O2 co-feeding in terms of selectivity, stability, and overall catalytic performance.

          该文献并未直接讨论促进剂或将CO2活化策略与O2共进料在铬基催化剂中进行比较。然而，它讨论了一些解决这些系统中CO2弱氧化能力的机制：

          1. 氧化还原循环机制：在CrOx/MCM-41催化剂上，逆水气变换（RWGS）反应通过氧化还原循环进行。丙烷脱氢产生的氢气将Cr3+还原为Cr2+，然后被CO2重新氧化。这允许CO2被间接活化。

          2. 载体效应：使用如二氧化硅等促进铬深度还原为Cr2+的载体，特别是在低铬含量时，使得CO2更容易重新氧化铬。

          3. 低铬含量：低铬含量的催化剂促进了更深层次的还原，生成Cr2+物种，这些物种比Cr3+更容易被CO2重新氧化。这是因为低铬含量防止了形成稳定的Cr2O3团簇，这些团簇会抵抗进一步的还原/氧化。

          4. 双功能性质：虽然没有明确说明，但像CrOx/SiO2这样的催化剂的双功能性质（对脱氢和RWGS反应都有活性）可能有助于在CO2存在下提高性能，相比于惰性气氛。

          这些策略旨在改善CO2的活化和氧化能力，相比于CO2直接氧化Cr3+（被发现是无效的）。然而，该文档并未提供关于这些方法在选择性、稳定性和整体催化性能方面如何与O2共进料相比较的信息。
