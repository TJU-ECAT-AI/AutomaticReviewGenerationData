          [1] "Carbon dioxide exerted promoting effects only on SiO2-supported Cr203 catalyst. The promoting effects of carbon dioxide over a Cr203/SiO2 catalyst were to enhance the yield of C3H6 and to suppress the catalyst deactivation."

[2] "The presence of CO2 markedly improved the yield of C3H6. This catalytic performance is a proof that CO2 plays a promoting role in the conversion of C3H8 to C3H6 over a Cr203/SiO2 catalyst."

[3] "The decrease in the yield of C3H6 was found much less in the presence of CO2 than in the absence of CO2. This finding suggests that the addition of CO2 could suppress the deactivation of the catalyst."

[4] "These findings suggest that the surface of Cr203 on a Cr203/SiO2 catalyst could be reduced during the dehydrogenation of C3H8 in the absence of CO2, whereas the surface of Cr203 might be maintained partially oxidized during the reaction in the presence of CO2."

[5] "The ratio of C3H6 yield in the reaction in the presence of CO2 to that in the absence of CO2 decreased with increasing Cr203 content in the Cr203/SiO2 catalyst, as shown Figure 4. This suggests that the boundaries between Cr203 and SiO2 particles might have an important role in the promoting effect of CO2."

          The literature does not directly address how promoters overcome CO2's weak oxidation potential or compare CO2 to O2 co-feeding in chromium-based catalytic systems. However, it provides insights into the advantages of using CO2 as a promoter:

1. Enhanced yield: CO2 improves the yield of C3H6 in the dehydrogenation of C3H8 over Cr2O3/SiO2 catalysts.

2. Suppressed deactivation: The presence of CO2 reduces catalyst deactivation, maintaining higher activity over time compared to reactions without CO2.

3. Surface oxidation state control: CO2 helps maintain the Cr2O3 surface in a partially oxidized state during the reaction, which appears to be beneficial for catalyst activity and stability. In the absence of CO2, the surface tends to become reduced.

4. Selective promotion: The promoting effects of CO2 are only observed on SiO2-supported Cr2O3 catalysts, suggesting a specific interaction between CO2, the chromium active sites, and the silica support.

5. Interface effect: The boundaries between Cr2O3 and SiO2 particles appear to play an important role in the promoting effect of CO2, as indicated by the relationship between Cr2O3 content and the promoting effect.

These benefits suggest that CO2 can act as an effective promoter in certain chromium-based catalytic systems, potentially offering advantages over other oxidizing agents in terms of selectivity and stability. The ability of CO2 to maintain a partially oxidized catalyst surface while simultaneously improving yield and stability could potentially offer advantages over more aggressive oxidants like O2. However, without direct comparison to O2 co-feeding or other strategies, it's not possible to definitively state the relative advantages of CO2 promotion in all aspects of catalyst performance.

          该文献并未直接讨论促进剂如何克服CO2的弱氧化能力，也没有将CO2与O2共进料在铬基催化系统中进行比较。但是，它提供了关于使用CO2作为促进剂的优势的见解：

1. 提高产率：在Cr2O3/SiO2催化剂上进行C3H8脱氢反应时，CO2提高了C3H6的产率。

2. 抑制失活：CO2的存在减少了催化剂的失活，与没有CO2的反应相比，能够长时间保持较高的活性。

3. 表面氧化状态控制：CO2有助于在反应过程中保持Cr2O3表面处于部分氧化状态，这似乎有利于催化剂的活性和稳定性。在没有CO2的情况下，表面倾向于被还原。

4. 选择性促进：CO2的促进作用仅在SiO2负载的Cr2O3催化剂上观察到，这表明CO2、铬活性位点和二氧化硅载体之间存在特定的相互作用。

5. 界面效应：Cr2O3和SiO2颗粒之间的界面似乎在CO2的促进作用中起重要作用，这从Cr2O3含量与促进效果之间的关系可以看出。

这些优点表明，CO2可以在某些铬基催化系统中作为有效的促进剂，在选择性和稳定性方面可能比其他氧化剂具有优势。CO2能够在维持催化剂表面部分氧化的同时提高产率和稳定性，这可能比O2等更具侵略性的氧化剂具有优势。然而，由于缺乏与O2共进料或其他策略的直接比较，无法确定地说明CO2促进在催化剂性能的所有方面相对于其他方法的优势。
