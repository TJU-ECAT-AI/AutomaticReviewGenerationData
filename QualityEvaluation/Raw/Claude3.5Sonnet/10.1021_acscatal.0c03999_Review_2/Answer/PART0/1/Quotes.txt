[1] "Nakagawa etal. reported that the surface Cr remained in a higher oxidation state in the presence of CO2 than in its absence in the oxidative dehydrogenation of lower alkanes. However, CO2 has limited oxidizing ability, in terms of reoxidation of the reduced CrOx, owing to its thermodynamically stable properties."

[2] "The oxidizing power can be improved by the addition of O2 in the reactant as a cofeed with CO2. The deactivation rate of the CrOx/silica catalyst was decreased by the addition of a small amount of O2. Unfortunately, the selectivity of the reaction for C3H6 was decreased significantly."

[3] "Therefore, the development of a suitable promoter to activate CO2 that would enhance the oxidizing ability of CO2 and also maintain a stable selectivity for propylene is highly desirable."

[4] "Ni-based catalysts are widely used in CO2 reforming reactions and the reverse watergas shift (RWGS) reaction. Such catalysts have an excellent ability to activate CO2, even under harsh reaction conditions."

[5] "Here, we report on the preparation of a Ni-promoted CrOx/SBA-15 catalyst by using a sequential impregnation method to decrease the deactivation of the catalyst in the ODHP reaction."

[6] "We assumed that Ni enhances the oxidizing ability of CO2 to reoxidize the reduced Cr2+ state to the active Cr3+ state and also Cr3+ to Cr6+."

[7] "Importantly, Ni maintained the stable catalytic activity. Higher conversion of CO2 and stable production of propylene imply that Ni dissociates CO2 to CO and O*ads, which regenerates the reduced Cr species Cr2+ to Cr3+ through reoxidation."

[8] "The chemisorbed CO2 undergoes a sequential carbonoxygen bond cleavage to generate CO and activated O (O*ads). Such O*ads generated on Ni could play a role in the reoxidation of the reduced CrOx species during the ODHP reaction."

[9] "By introducing Ni on the Cr/Si catalyst, catalyst deactivation can be reduced and the regeneration of active sites can be achieved."

[10] "The promotional activation of CO2 owed to the added Ni on the Cr/Si catalyst. The deactivation tendency of the 0.5Ni-Cr/Si catalyst was significantly lower than that of the non-promoted catalyst."

[1] "CO2 has been proposed to participate in the redox cycles of Cr2+  Cr3+ (59,64) or Cr3+  Cr6+; (56,80,91) however, its oxidation potential is rather weak. Besides, CO2 is quite inert and not easily activated by CrOx."

[2] "The addition of O2 in the reactants as a co-feed with CO2 has been initially proposed to overcome these issues, yet the selectivity drops."

[3] "An alternative is to introduce promoters to facilitate CO2 activation on the Cr2O3 catalysts and to improve its oxidizing ability for selective and stable performance."

[4] "Because of their basic property, alkali metal oxides have been widely used as promoters for CO2 adsorption and activation in CO2 hydrogenation reactions."

[5] "Ru is a potential promoter because of its high activity in CO2 hydrogenation."

[6] "Ni is also a potential candidate because of its activity in CO2 activation for CO2 reforming reactions (96,97) and RWGS."

[7] "The major role of Ni is to facilitate CO2 dissociation to CO and an adsorbed O* next to the Ni site, which can subsequently regenerate Cr3+ via reoxidation."

[1] "Carbon dioxide exerted promoting effects only on SiO2-supported Cr203 catalyst. The promoting effects of carbon dioxide over a Cr203/SiO2 catalyst were to enhance the yield of C3H6 and to suppress the catalyst deactivation."

[2] "The presence of CO2 markedly improved the yield of C3H6. This catalytic performance is a proof that CO2 plays a promoting role in the conversion of C3H8 to C3H6 over a Cr203/SiO2 catalyst."

[3] "The decrease in the yield of C3H6 was found much less in the presence of CO2 than in the absence of CO2. This finding suggests that the addition of CO2 could suppress the deactivation of the catalyst."

[4] "These findings suggest that the surface of Cr203 on a Cr203/SiO2 catalyst could be reduced during the dehydrogenation of C3H8 in the absence of CO2, whereas the surface of Cr203 might be maintained partially oxidized during the reaction in the presence of CO2."

[5] "The ratio of C3H6 yield in the reaction in the presence of CO2 to that in the absence of CO2 decreased with increasing Cr203 content in the Cr203/SiO2 catalyst, as shown Figure 4. This suggests that the boundaries between Cr203 and SiO2 particles might have an important role in the promoting effect of CO2."

[1] "The introduction of oxidizing agents (O2, CO2) makes it possible to decrease the resulting coke amount. Furthermore, an oxidizing agent interacts with hydrogen to shift the thermodynamic equilibrium of the dehydrogenation reaction toward the formation of olefins."

[2] "The use of CO2 makes it possible to increase the process selectivity and the stability of catalysts."

[3] "The best promoter was K, and its content changed from 0.1 to 1.0% (by weight). The optimum potassium content of the 5% CrOx/SiO2 catalyst was 0.20.4%. At these K concentrations in the catalyst, the selectivity of the formation of propene was 100% at a 22% conversion of propane."

[4] "The introduction of potassium into the chromium oxide catalysts can be effective for increasing their stability and selectivity. On the catalyst containing 2.0% Cr and 0.31% K, the yield of propene was at a high level for 60 h, and the selectivity of the formation of propene on it was higher than on the chromium oxide catalyst without K."

[5] "The introduction of alkaline promoters into chromium oxide catalysts is one of the ways of increasing the effectiveness of them."

[1] "CO2 was found to enhance the dehydrogenation of propane2 or ethane3 over silica supported chromium oxide."

          [2] "It was clearly observed that CO was selectively produced from CO2 during the C3H8 dehydrogenation over Cr-MCM-41."

          [3] "Not only O2 but also CO2 could regenerate the Cr6+O4 tetrahedra from the reduced Cr3+O6 octahedra as suggested by the results of TPR and EXAFS."

          [4] "It is concluded that during the reaction C3H8 is dehydrogenated to C3H6 by Cr6+O4 tetrahedra, which is simultaneously reduced to Cr3+O6 octahedra. The reduced Cr3+O6 octahedra is reoxidized to Cr6+O4 tetrahedra by CO2, and thus the reduction-oxidation cycle between Cr6+O4 tetrahedra and Cr3+O6 octahedra possesses an important role in the dehydrogenation of C3H8 with CO2 over Cr-MCM-41."

"Carbon dioxide (CO2) has been thought to be a possible substitute for oxygen. The introduction of CO2 in the catalytic dehydrogenation of propane has many potential advantages."

"First, thermodynamic equilibrium limitation is overcome and propylene yield is improved by removal of hydrogen (CO2 + H2 â†’ CO + H2O); second, deep oxidation that occurred as a result of using oxygen as oxidant is avoided; third, it realizes the recycling of greenhouse gas CO2 when used as a soft oxidant."

"Cr/MSU-x catalyst exhibited good activity in the ODH of ethane with CO2 according to our previous study [14]. The catalysts exhibit excellent activity in the dehydrogenation of propane with CO2."

[1] "The DRS results obtained during the regeneration of the reduced CrOx/SiO2 catalyst show that CO2 is a very weak oxidant and that the efficiency of reoxidation by CO2 is much lower than that by oxygen."

          [2] "Recently, Ohishi et al. [12] have proposed that over the CrOx/MCM-41 catalyst, the RWGS reaction can proceed via a redox cycle."

          [3] "According to this mechanism, hydrogen formed in the dehydrogenation of propane reduces Cr3+ to Cr2+ species (1), which in the next step are reoxidized by CO2 (2)."

          [4] "On the surface of silica, a deep reduction of chromium species to Cr2+ is promoted especially at low Cr content, where the migration of Cr3+ species to form the stable Cr2O3 clusters is slow and further reduction of Cr3+ to Cr2+ species can continue."

[1] "CO2, being a much milder oxidant, can effectively consume H2 under dehydrogenation conditions, although it is not reactive enough to oxidize the hydrocarbons in the reaction mixture."

[2] "The cofeeding of CO2 may result in additional coke deposition, due to the increased CO and decreased H2 partial pressures brought about by the reverse watergas shift reaction. On the other hand, coke may be gasified by CO2."

[3] "CO2 competitively adsorbs on the surface, specifically on the basic sites of the catalyst materials, which can negatively affect their performance."

[4] "A number of studies have shown that the addition of CO2 to the reactant feed improves the olefin yield."

[5] "Nakagawa et al. found that the addition of steam and CO2 decreased coke deposition on a Ga2O3/TiO2 catalyst by the Boudouart reaction, while also assisting ethylene desorption."

[1] "Recently, carbon dioxide (CO2), as a promising nonconventional oxidant for catalytic oxidative dehydrogenation of light alkanes to olefins, has drawn much attention. In comparison with molecular O2, the lower oxidizing activity of CO2 is shown to shift the ODH reaction toward more olefin production, which means that more reactive olefins are prevented for deep oxidation in the presence of CO2"

          [2] "CO2 can also oxidize active sites and stabilize the catalyst by eliminating coke through the reverse Boudouard reaction"

          [3] "The foremost effect of CO2 is inhibiting rather than eliminating coke. Moreover, a possible new coke formation route is proposed."

          [4] "To open 4%CO2/2%H2/Ar gas and keep 50 ml/min total gas flowing for 60 min, no new peaks were observed (Fig. S5B). But when CO2 gas flow was closed down and H2 gas proportion turned up to 5%H2/Ar, new bands appear at 1395 and 1595 cm1 (assigned to the D-band and G-band of coke, respectively [4648]), and they become sharper with reaction time as shown in Fig. S5C."

          [5] "CO2 consumes hydrogen species through the reverse water-gas shift (RWGS) reaction, which is beneficial for enhancing the equilibrium of light alkane conversion. CO2 can also oxidize active sites and stabilize the catalyst by eliminating coke through the reverse Boudouard reaction"

          [6] "CO2 can inhabit the reduction of active oxidative chromium species by excessive hydrogen species."

[1] "Nakagawa etal. reported that the surface Cr remained in a higher oxidation state in the presence of CO2 than in its absence in the oxidative dehydrogenation of lower alkanes.
