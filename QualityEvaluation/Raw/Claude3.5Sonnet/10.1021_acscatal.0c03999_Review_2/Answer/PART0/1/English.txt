Promoters like Ni address the limitations of CO2's weak oxidation potential and inertness in chromium-based catalytic systems by enhancing CO2 activation and improving its oxidizing ability. Ni-based promoters offer several advantages over alternative strategies like O2 co-feeding:

1. Enhanced CO2 activation: Ni has an excellent ability to activate CO2, even under harsh reaction conditions. It dissociates CO2 into CO and activated oxygen (O*ads), which can then regenerate reduced chromium species.

2. Improved oxidizing ability: Ni enhances the oxidizing ability of CO2, allowing it to reoxidize reduced Cr2+ to the active Cr3+ state and further to Cr6+. This helps maintain the active sites of the catalyst.

3. Stable selectivity: Unlike O2 co-feeding, which can significantly decrease selectivity for propylene, Ni-promoted catalysts maintain stable selectivity while improving catalytic performance.

4. Reduced deactivation: Ni-promoted catalysts show decreased deactivation rates compared to unpromoted catalysts, leading to more stable catalytic activity over time.

5. Higher CO2 conversion: Ni-promoted catalysts demonstrate higher CO2 conversion rates, indicating more efficient use of the CO2 reactant.

6. Stable propylene production: The combination of higher CO2 conversion and maintained selectivity results in stable propylene production, which is a key goal in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reactions.

7. Regeneration of active sites: Ni enables the regeneration of active Cr3+ sites from inactive Cr2+, addressing a key deactivation mechanism.

8. No trade-off between activity and selectivity: Unlike O2 co-feeding which improves activity at the cost of selectivity, Ni promotion enhances both aspects simultaneously.

In summary, Ni promoters offer a more balanced approach to enhancing CO2 activation and oxidizing ability while maintaining selectivity and stability, making them advantageous over O2 co-feeding in chromium-based catalytic systems for ODHP reactions.

Promoters address the limitations of CO2's weak oxidation potential and inertness in chromium-based catalytic systems by facilitating CO2 activation and improving its oxidizing ability. They offer several advantages over O2 co-feeding:

1. Selectivity: While O2 co-feeding can overcome CO2's limitations, it leads to a drop in selectivity. Promoters, on the other hand, can enhance CO2 activation while maintaining or improving selectivity.

2. CO2 Adsorption and Activation: Alkali metal oxides, due to their basic properties, promote CO2 adsorption and activation in CO2 hydrogenation reactions. This helps overcome CO2's inertness.

3. Improved Hydrogenation: Ru serves as a potential promoter due to its high activity in CO2 hydrogenation, which can enhance the overall reaction process.

4. Enhanced CO2 Dissociation: Ni promotes CO2 activation for reforming reactions and water-gas shift reactions. It facilitates CO2 dissociation to CO and adsorbed O*, which can then regenerate Cr3+ through reoxidation.

5. Stability: Some promoters, like K in alkali metal oxides, can improve the stability of C3H6 yield.

6. Balanced Reactivity: Proper amounts of promoters like Ru can optimize activity and selectivity by balancing reactions such as RWGS and C3H6 reforming.

7. Tuning of Catalyst Properties: Promoters can modify the surface properties of the catalyst, such as redox potential and surface acidity, allowing for fine-tuning of catalytic performance.

By introducing these promoters, the catalytic system can achieve more selective and stable performance compared to O2 co-feeding, while effectively addressing CO2's weak oxidation potential and inertness.

The literature does not directly address how promoters overcome CO2's weak oxidation potential or compare CO2 to O2 co-feeding in chromium-based catalytic systems. However, it provides insights into the advantages of using CO2 as a promoter:

1. Enhanced yield: CO2 improves the yield of C3H6 in the dehydrogenation of C3H8 over Cr2O3/SiO2 catalysts.

2. Suppressed deactivation: The presence of CO2 reduces catalyst deactivation, maintaining higher activity over time compared to reactions without CO2.

3. Surface oxidation state control: CO2 helps maintain the Cr2O3 surface in a partially oxidized state during the reaction, which appears to be beneficial for catalyst activity and stability. In the absence of CO2, the surface tends to become reduced.

4. Selective promotion: The promoting effects of CO2 are only observed on SiO2-supported Cr2O3 catalysts, suggesting a specific interaction between CO2, the chromium active sites, and the silica support.

5. Interface effect: The boundaries between Cr2O3 and SiO2 particles appear to play an important role in the promoting effect of CO2, as indicated by the relationship between Cr2O3 content and the promoting effect.

These benefits suggest that CO2 can act as an effective promoter in certain chromium-based catalytic systems, potentially offering advantages over other oxidizing agents in terms of selectivity and stability. The ability of CO2 to maintain a partially oxidized catalyst surface while simultaneously improving yield and stability could potentially offer advantages over more aggressive oxidants like O2. However, without direct comparison to O2 co-feeding or other strategies, it's not possible to definitively state the relative advantages of CO2 promotion in all aspects of catalyst performance.

Promoters, particularly alkaline promoters like potassium, address the limitations of CO2's weak oxidation potential and inertness in chromium-based catalytic systems in several ways:

1. Enhanced CO2 activation: Promoters help shift the thermodynamic equilibrium of the dehydrogenation reaction towards olefin formation by facilitating CO2's interaction with hydrogen.

2. Improved oxidizing ability: The addition of promoters like potassium increases the effectiveness of CO2 as an oxidizing agent.

3. Increased selectivity: CO2 with promoters allows for higher selectivity compared to using O2 as an oxidizing agent. For example, optimum potassium content in CrOx/SiO2 catalysts resulted in 100% selectivity for propene formation at 22% propane conversion.

4. Enhanced catalyst stability: Promoters, especially potassium, have been shown to increase the stability of chromium oxide catalysts, allowing for longer catalyst lifetimes and sustained performance over extended periods.

5. Reduced coke formation: The introduction of CO2 as an oxidizing agent, coupled with promoters, helps decrease coke deposition on the catalyst surface.

Compared to O2 co-feeding, using CO2 with promoters offers several advantages:

1. Higher selectivity: CO2 is less likely to cause deep oxidation of paraffins and olefins compared to O2.

2. Better stability: Catalysts promoted with alkali metals like potassium show improved stability over longer periods.

3. More controlled oxidation: CO2 provides a milder oxidizing environment compared to O2, allowing for better control of the reaction when combined with promoters.

4. Improved catalyst lifetime: By reducing coke formation, promoters help extend catalyst life compared to O2 co-feeding, which can lead to faster deactivation.

5. Environmental benefits: CO2 utilization in this process can be environmentally beneficial, especially when using CO2 from waste gases.

Overall, the use of promoters with CO2 provides a more selective, stable, and controlled catalytic performance compared to O2 co-feeding, while still addressing coke formation issues and shifting equilibrium favorably towards olefin production.

The literature does not directly address promoters or compare CO2 to O2 co-feeding. However, it provides insights into how CO2 functions in chromium-based catalytic systems for propane dehydrogenation:

          1. CO2 enhances the dehydrogenation of propane and ethane over silica-supported chromium oxide catalysts.
          
          2. In the Cr-MCM-41 system, CO2 serves as both an oxidant and a source of CO production. It selectively produces CO during propane dehydrogenation.
          
          3. The key advantage of using CO2 is its ability to regenerate the active Cr6+O4 tetrahedra species from reduced Cr3+O6 octahedra. This creates a reduction-oxidation cycle between Cr6+ and Cr3+ species that is crucial for the dehydrogenation reaction.
          
          4. CO2 effectively reoxidizes the catalyst and maintains its activity, indicating that it can overcome its inherent inertness in this system.
          
          5. While not explicitly compared to O2, the selective oxidation by CO2 suggests it may offer advantages in terms of reaction control, selectivity, and catalyst stability compared to stronger oxidants like O2, which could lead to over-oxidation.
          
          6. The stability of the Cr-MCM-41 catalyst when using CO2 is demonstrated by its ability to be repeatedly regenerated, suggesting CO2 allows for stable catalytic performance in this system.

          These findings indicate that CO2 can effectively address its limitations of weak oxidation potential and inertness in this specific chromium-based catalytic system, providing a selective and stable performance for propane dehydrogenation.

The literature does not directly address the use of promoters or compare CO2 to O2 co-feeding in chromium-based catalytic systems. However, it does highlight some advantages of using CO2 instead of oxygen in propane dehydrogenation:

1. CO2 helps overcome thermodynamic equilibrium limitations by removing hydrogen, thereby improving propylene yield.

2. Using CO2 avoids deep oxidation that can occur when using oxygen as an oxidant.

3. CO2 acts as a "soft oxidant" and allows for recycling of this greenhouse gas.

The study shows that chromium catalysts supported on mesoporous silica (Cr/MSU-x) exhibit excellent activity for propane dehydrogenation with CO2, but does not discuss specific promoters or compare to O2 co-feeding strategies.

The document does not provide information on how promoters specifically enhance CO2 activation or improve oxidizing ability in chromium-based systems. More research would be needed to fully answer the question about promoters and their specific advantages over O2 co-feeding strategies in terms of enhancing CO2 activation, improving oxidizing ability, and achieving selective and stable catalytic performance.

The literature does not directly address promoters or compare CO2 activation strategies to O2 co-feeding for chromium-based catalysts. However, it discusses some mechanisms to address CO2's weak oxidation potential in these systems:

          1. Redox cycle mechanism: In CrOx/MCM-41 catalysts, the reverse water-gas shift (RWGS) reaction proceeds via a redox cycle. Hydrogen from propane dehydrogenation reduces Cr3+ to Cr2+, which is then reoxidized by CO2. This allows CO2 to be activated indirectly.

          2. Support effect: Using supports like silica that promote deep reduction of chromium to Cr2+, especially at low chromium loadings, allows CO2 to more easily reoxidize the chromium.

          3. Low chromium content: Catalysts with low chromium content promote deeper reduction to Cr2+ species, which are more easily reoxidized by CO2 than Cr3+. This is because low Cr content prevents formation of stable Cr2O3 clusters resistant to further reduction/oxidation.

          4. Bi-functional nature: While not explicitly stated, the bi-functional nature of catalysts like CrOx/SiO2 (active for both dehydrogenation and RWGS) likely contributes to improved performance with CO2 compared to inert atmospheres.

          These strategies aim to improve CO2 activation and oxidizing ability compared to direct oxidation of Cr3+ by CO2, which was found to be ineffective. However, the document does not provide information on how these approaches compare to O2 co-feeding in terms of selectivity, stability, and overall catalytic performance.

The literature does not directly address how promoters enhance CO2 activation or improve its oxidizing ability in chromium-based catalytic systems for dehydrogenation. The text mainly discusses general effects and limitations of using CO2 as an oxidant, without mentioning specific promoters or comparing CO2 to O2 co-feeding for chromium catalysts. 

However, the document does mention some general effects of CO2 in catalytic dehydrogenation:

1. CO2 is a milder oxidant than O2, able to consume H2 but not oxidize hydrocarbons.
2. CO2 co-feeding may have both positive and negative effects on coke formation. It can increase coke deposition due to the reverse water-gas shift reaction, but it may also gasify coke.
3. CO2 can competitively adsorb on catalyst basic sites, potentially negatively affecting performance.
4. Some studies have shown that CO2 addition can improve olefin yield.
5. In some systems (e.g., Ga2O3/TiO2), CO2 addition (along with steam) can decrease coke deposition and assist product desorption.

To properly answer the question about promoters for chromium-based systems specifically, their advantages over O2 co-feeding, or their effects on CO2 activation and selective oxidation, additional information would be needed that is not provided in this literature excerpt.

The literature does not directly address promoters for enhancing CO2 activation in chromium-based catalytic systems. However, it discusses several advantages of using CO2 as an oxidant compared to O2:

          1. CO2 has lower oxidizing activity than O2, which shifts the reaction towards more olefin production by preventing deep oxidation of reactive olefins.

          2. CO2 can oxidize active sites and stabilize the catalyst by eliminating coke through the reverse Boudouard reaction.

          3. The main effect of CO2 is inhibiting coke formation rather than eliminating existing coke.

          4. The presence of CO2 prevents the formation of coke bands in Raman spectra, which appear when CO2 is removed and H2 concentration is increased.

          5. CO2 consumes hydrogen species through the reverse water-gas shift (RWGS) reaction, which enhances the equilibrium of light alkane conversion.

          6. CO2 prevents the over-reduction of active oxidative chromium species by consuming excess hydrogen.

          These properties allow CO2 to act as a milder, more selective oxidant compared to O2, potentially improving catalyst stability and product selectivity. However, the document does not discuss specific promoters or compare CO2 to O2 co-feeding strategies in detail. More research would be needed to fully answer the question about promoters enhancing CO2 activation and oxidizing ability in chromium-based systems.
