[1] "The generally accepted role of carbon dioxide in the dehydrogenation of hydrocarbons is removal of hydrogen and suppression of coke deposition on the catalyst surface."

[2] "It is proposed that carbon dioxide can react directly with hydrogen to make the water gas (CO + H2O) or can act as a mild oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation."

[3] "It has been recognized that acidic nature as well as redox one is an important property of CO2. Few studies have been reported that the acidic property of CO2 plays some important role in the dehydrogenation of hydrocarbons with CO2, especially in the determination of the yield of reaction product"

The literature does not directly address promoters or compare CO2 to O2 co-feeding for chromium-based catalysts. However, it does discuss some advantages of using CO2 in dehydrogenation reactions:

CO2 helps remove hydrogen and suppress coke formation on the catalyst surface. It can act as a mild oxidant or react directly with hydrogen to form water gas. The acidic nature of CO2 also plays an important role in determining product yields.

The document does not provide information on specific promoters or compare CO2 activation strategies to O2 co-feeding. More research would be needed to fully answer the question about promoters and alternative strategies for enhancing CO2 activation and improving oxidizing ability in chromium-based catalytic systems.

该文献并未直接讨论助剂或将CO2与O2共进料用于铬基催化剂的比较。但是,它确实讨论了在脱氢反应中使用CO2的一些优点:

CO2有助于去除氢气并抑制催化剂表面的积碳形成。它可以作为温和的氧化剂或直接与氢反应生成水煤气。CO2的酸性特征在决定产物产率方面也起着重要作用。

该文献未提供关于特定助剂的信息,也未将CO2活化策略与O2共进料进行比较。需要进行更多研究才能全面回答有关助剂和替代策略以增强CO2活化和改善铬基催化系统氧化能力的问题。
