[1] "Nakagawa etal. reported that the surface Cr remained in a higher oxidation state in the presence of CO2 than in its absence in the oxidative dehydrogenation of lower alkanes. However, CO2 has limited oxidizing ability, in terms of reoxidation of the reduced CrOx, owing to its thermodynamically stable properties."

[2] "The oxidizing power can be improved by the addition of O2 in the reactant as a cofeed with CO2. The deactivation rate of the CrOx/silica catalyst was decreased by the addition of a small amount of O2. Unfortunately, the selectivity of the reaction for C3H6 was decreased significantly."

[3] "Therefore, the development of a suitable promoter to activate CO2 that would enhance the oxidizing ability of CO2 and also maintain a stable selectivity for propylene is highly desirable."

[4] "Ni-based catalysts are widely used in CO2 reforming reactions and the reverse watergas shift (RWGS) reaction. Such catalysts have an excellent ability to activate CO2, even under harsh reaction conditions."

[5] "Here, we report on the preparation of a Ni-promoted CrOx/SBA-15 catalyst by using a sequential impregnation method to decrease the deactivation of the catalyst in the ODHP reaction."

[6] "We assumed that Ni enhances the oxidizing ability of CO2 to reoxidize the reduced Cr2+ state to the active Cr3+ state and also Cr3+ to Cr6+."

[7] "Importantly, Ni maintained the stable catalytic activity. Higher conversion of CO2 and stable production of propylene imply that Ni dissociates CO2 to CO and O*ads, which regenerates the reduced Cr species Cr2+ to Cr3+ through reoxidation."

Promoters like Ni address the limitations of CO2's weak oxidation potential and inertness in chromium-based catalytic systems by enhancing CO2 activation and improving its oxidizing ability. Ni-based promoters offer several advantages over alternative strategies like O2 co-feeding:

1. Enhanced CO2 activation: Ni has an excellent ability to activate CO2, even under harsh reaction conditions. It dissociates CO2 into CO and activated oxygen (O*ads), which can then regenerate reduced chromium species.

2. Improved oxidizing ability: Ni enhances the oxidizing ability of CO2, allowing it to reoxidize reduced Cr2+ to the active Cr3+ state and further to Cr6+. This helps maintain the active sites of the catalyst.

3. Stable selectivity: Unlike O2 co-feeding, which can significantly decrease selectivity for propylene, Ni-promoted catalysts maintain stable selectivity while improving catalytic performance.

4. Reduced deactivation: Ni-promoted catalysts show decreased deactivation rates compared to unpromoted catalysts, leading to more stable catalytic activity over time.

5. Higher CO2 conversion: Ni-promoted catalysts demonstrate higher CO2 conversion rates, indicating more efficient use of the CO2 reactant.

6. Stable propylene production: The combination of higher CO2 conversion and maintained selectivity results in stable propylene production, which is a key goal in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reactions.

In summary, Ni promoters offer a more balanced approach to enhancing CO2 activation and oxidizing ability while maintaining selectivity and stability, making them advantageous over O2 co-feeding in chromium-based catalytic systems for ODHP reactions.

像Ni这样的促进剂通过增强CO2活化和改善其氧化能力来解决CO2在铬基催化系统中氧化能力弱和惰性的限制。与O2共进料等替代策略相比，Ni基促进剂具有以下几个优势：

1. 增强CO2活化：Ni具有出色的CO2活化能力，即使在苛刻的反应条件下也能发挥作用。它将CO2解离成CO和活性氧（O*ads），后者可以再生还原的铬物种。

2. 改善氧化能力：Ni增强了CO2的氧化能力，使其能够将还原的Cr2+重新氧化为活性Cr3+状态，甚至进一步氧化为Cr6+。这有助于维持催化剂的活性位点。

3. 稳定的选择性：与可能显著降低丙烯选择性的O2共进料不同，Ni促进的催化剂在改善催化性能的同时保持了稳定的选择性。

4. 降低失活：与未促进的催化剂相比，Ni促进的催化剂表现出更低的失活率，从而导致随时间推移催化活性更加稳定。

5. 更高的CO2转化率：Ni促进的催化剂表现出更高的CO2转化率，表明CO2反应物的使用更加高效。

6. 稳定的丙烯产量：更高的CO2转化率和保持的选择性相结合，导致丙烯产量稳定，这是丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）反应的一个关键目标。

总之，Ni促进剂在增强CO2活化和氧化能力的同时保持选择性和稳定性，提供了一种更平衡的方法，使其在用于ODHP反应的铬基催化系统中比O2共进料更具优势。
