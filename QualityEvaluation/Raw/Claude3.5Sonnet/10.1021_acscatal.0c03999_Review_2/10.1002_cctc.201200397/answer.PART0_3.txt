[1] "Nakagawa etal. reported that the surface Cr remained in a higher oxidation state in the presence of CO2 than in its absence in the oxidative dehydrogenation of lower alkanes. However, CO2 has limited oxidizing ability, in terms of reoxidation of the reduced CrOx, owing to its thermodynamically stable properties."

[2] "The oxidizing power can be improved by the addition of O2 in the reactant as a cofeed with CO2. The deactivation rate of the CrOx/silica catalyst was decreased by the addition of a small amount of O2. Unfortunately, the selectivity of the reaction for C3H6 was decreased significantly."

[3] "Here, we report on the preparation of a Ni-promoted CrOx/SBA-15 catalyst by using a sequential impregnation method to decrease the deactivation of the catalyst in the ODHP reaction."

[4] "We assumed that Ni enhances the oxidizing ability of CO2 to reoxidize the reduced Cr2+ state to the active Cr3+ state and also Cr3+ to Cr6+."

[5] "Ni maintained the stable catalytic activity. Higher conversion of CO2 and stable production of propylene imply that Ni dissociates CO2 to CO and O*ads, which regenerates the reduced Cr species Cr2+ to Cr3+ through reoxidation."

Promoters like Ni address the limitations of CO2's weak oxidation potential in chromium-based catalytic systems by enhancing CO2 activation and improving its oxidizing ability. Ni specifically offers several advantages over alternative strategies like O2 co-feeding:

1. Enhanced CO2 activation: Ni promotes the dissociation of CO2 into CO and activated oxygen (O*ads), which can then reoxidize reduced chromium species.

2. Improved oxidizing ability: Ni enables CO2 to more effectively reoxidize reduced Cr2+ to active Cr3+ states, and even Cr3+ to Cr6+, maintaining the catalyst's active phase.

3. Selective and stable performance: Unlike O2 co-feeding, which decreases selectivity for propylene, Ni-promoted catalysts maintain high selectivity while improving stability. They show higher CO2 conversion and stable propylene production over time.

4. Reduced deactivation: Ni helps maintain the active Cr3+ state during the reaction, preventing the formation of inactive Cr2+ and thus reducing catalyst deactivation.

5. Avoiding trade-offs: O2 co-feeding decreases deactivation but significantly reduces propylene selectivity. Ni promotion achieves both improved stability and maintained selectivity without this trade-off.

These advantages make Ni promotion a more effective strategy for enhancing CO2 activation and achieving stable, selective catalytic performance in chromium-based oxidative dehydrogenation of propane with CO2.

像镍这样的助剂通过增强二氧化碳的活化和改善其氧化能力来解决铬基催化系统中二氧化碳氧化能力弱的限制。镍具体提供了几个优于替代策略（如氧气共进料）的优势：

1. 增强二氧化碳活化：镍促进二氧化碳分解为一氧化碳和活性氧（O*ads），后者可以重新氧化还原的铬物种。

2. 改善氧化能力：镍使二氧化碳能够更有效地将还原态的Cr2+重新氧化为活性Cr3+态，甚至将Cr3+氧化为Cr6+，从而维持催化剂的活性相。

3. 选择性和稳定性能：与降低丙烯选择性的氧气共进料不同，镍促进的催化剂在提高稳定性的同时保持了高选择性。它们表现出更高的二氧化碳转化率和长期稳定的丙烯产量。

4. 降低失活：镍有助于在反应过程中维持活性Cr3+态，防止形成非活性Cr2+，从而减少催化剂失活。

5. 避免权衡：氧气共进料虽然减少失活，但显著降低了丙烯选择性。镍促进既实现了改善的稳定性，又保持了选择性，避免了这种权衡。

这些优势使得镍促进成为一种更有效的策略，用于增强二氧化碳活化并在铬基催化剂上实现丙烷与二氧化碳氧化脱氢反应的稳定、选择性催化性能。
