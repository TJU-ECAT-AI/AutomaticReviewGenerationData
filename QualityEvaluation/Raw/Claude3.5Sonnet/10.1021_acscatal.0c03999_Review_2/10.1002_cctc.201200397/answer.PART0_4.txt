[1] "The oxidizing power can be improved by the addition of O2 in the reactant as a cofeed with CO2. The deactivation rate of the CrOx/silica catalyst was decreased by the addition of a small amount of O2. Unfortunately, the selectivity of the reaction for C3H6 was decreased significantly."

[2] "Therefore, the development of a suitable promoter to activate CO2 that would enhance the oxidizing ability of CO2 and also maintain a stable selectivity for propylene is highly desirable."

[3] "Here, we report on the preparation of a Ni-promoted CrOx/SBA-15 catalyst by using a sequential impregnation method to decrease the deactivation of the catalyst in the ODHP reaction."

[4] "We assumed that Ni enhances the oxidizing ability of CO2 to reoxidize the reduced Cr2+ state to the active Cr3+ state and also Cr3+ to Cr6+."

[5] "Importantly, Ni maintained the stable catalytic activity. Higher conversion of CO2 and stable production of propylene imply that Ni dissociates CO2 to CO and O*ads, which regenerates the reduced Cr species Cr2+ to Cr3+ through reoxidation."

Promoters like Ni address the limitations of CO2's weak oxidation potential in chromium-based catalytic systems by enhancing CO2 activation and improving its oxidizing ability. Compared to O2 co-feeding, Ni promoters offer several advantages:

1. Enhanced CO2 activation: Ni dissociates CO2 into CO and activated oxygen (O*ads), effectively activating the otherwise inert CO2 molecule.

2. Improved oxidizing ability: The O*ads generated by Ni-promoted CO2 dissociation can reoxidize reduced Cr species (Cr2+ to Cr3+ and Cr3+ to Cr6+), maintaining the active catalytic sites.

3. Stable selectivity: Unlike O2 co-feeding, which decreases selectivity for propylene, Ni promoters maintain stable selectivity while improving catalytic activity.

4. Reduced deactivation: Ni-promoted catalysts show decreased deactivation rates compared to unpromoted catalysts, leading to more stable long-term performance.

5. Higher CO2 conversion: Ni-promoted catalysts achieve higher CO2 conversion rates, effectively utilizing more of the greenhouse gas in the reaction.

These advantages make Ni promoters a more attractive option for enhancing CO2 activation and oxidizing ability in chromium-based catalytic systems, achieving both selective and stable catalytic performance in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reactions.

像Ni这样的促进剂通过增强CO2的活化和改善其氧化能力来解决铬基催化系统中CO2氧化能力弱的限制。与O2共进料相比，Ni促进剂提供了以下几个优势：

1. 增强CO2活化：Ni将CO2分解为CO和活性氧（O*ads），有效地活化了原本惰性的CO2分子。

2. 改善氧化能力：由Ni促进的CO2分解产生的O*ads可以重新氧化还原的Cr物种（Cr2+到Cr3+和Cr3+到Cr6+），维持活性催化位点。

3. 稳定的选择性：与降低丙烯选择性的O2共进料不同，Ni促进剂在提高催化活性的同时保持了稳定的选择性。

4. 降低失活：Ni促进的催化剂与未促进的催化剂相比，显示出较低的失活率，从而导致更稳定的长期性能。

5. 更高的CO2转化率：Ni促进的催化剂实现了更高的CO2转化率，在反应中更有效地利用了这种温室气体。

这些优势使Ni促进剂成为增强铬基催化系统中CO2活化和氧化能力的更具吸引力的选择，在丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）反应中实现了选择性和稳定性兼备的催化性能。
