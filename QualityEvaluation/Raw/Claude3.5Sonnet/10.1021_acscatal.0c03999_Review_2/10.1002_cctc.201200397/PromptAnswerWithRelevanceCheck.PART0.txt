[1] "Nakagawa etal. reported that the surface Cr remained in a higher oxidation state in the presence of CO2 than in its absence in the oxidative dehydrogenation of lower alkanes. However, CO2 has limited oxidizing ability, in terms of reoxidation of the reduced CrOx, owing to its thermodynamically stable properties."

[2] "The oxidizing power can be improved by the addition of O2 in the reactant as a cofeed with CO2. The deactivation rate of the CrOx/silica catalyst was decreased by the addition of a small amount of O2. Unfortunately, the selectivity of the reaction for C3H6 was decreased significantly."

[3] "Therefore, the development of a suitable promoter to activate CO2 that would enhance the oxidizing ability of CO2 and also maintain a stable selectivity for propylene is highly desirable."

[4] "Ni-based catalysts are widely used in CO2 reforming reactions and the reverse watergas shift (RWGS) reaction. Such catalysts have an excellent ability to activate CO2, even under harsh reaction conditions."

[5] "Here, we report on the preparation of a Ni-promoted CrOx/SBA-15 catalyst by using a sequential impregnation method to decrease the deactivation of the catalyst in the ODHP reaction."

[6] "We assumed that Ni enhances the oxidizing ability of CO2 to reoxidize the reduced Cr2+ state to the active Cr3+ state and also Cr3+ to Cr6+."

[7] "Importantly, Ni maintained the stable catalytic activity. Higher conversion of CO2 and stable production of propylene imply that Ni dissociates CO2 to CO and O*ads, which regenerates the reduced Cr species Cr2+ to Cr3+ through reoxidation."

Promoters like Ni address the limitations of CO2's weak oxidation potential and inertness in chromium-based catalytic systems by enhancing CO2 activation and improving its oxidizing ability. Ni-based promoters offer several advantages over alternative strategies like O2 co-feeding:

1. Enhanced CO2 activation: Ni has an excellent ability to activate CO2, even under harsh reaction conditions. It dissociates CO2 into CO and activated oxygen (O*ads), which can then regenerate reduced chromium species.

2. Improved oxidizing ability: Ni enhances the oxidizing ability of CO2, allowing it to reoxidize reduced Cr2+ to the active Cr3+ state and further to Cr6+. This helps maintain the active sites of the catalyst.

3. Stable selectivity: Unlike O2 co-feeding, which can significantly decrease selectivity for propylene, Ni-promoted catalysts maintain stable selectivity while improving catalytic performance.

4. Reduced deactivation: Ni-promoted catalysts show decreased deactivation rates compared to unpromoted catalysts, leading to more stable catalytic activity over time.

5. Higher CO2 conversion: Ni-promoted catalysts demonstrate higher CO2 conversion rates, indicating more efficient use of the CO2 reactant.

6. Stable propylene production: The combination of higher CO2 conversion and maintained selectivity results in stable propylene production, which is a key goal in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reactions.

In summary, Ni promoters offer a more balanced approach to enhancing CO2 activation and oxidizing ability while maintaining selectivity and stability, making them advantageous over O2 co-feeding in chromium-based catalytic systems for ODHP reactions.

像Ni这样的促进剂通过增强CO2活化和改善其氧化能力来解决CO2在铬基催化系统中氧化能力弱和惰性的限制。与O2共进料等替代策略相比，Ni基促进剂具有以下几个优势：

1. 增强CO2活化：Ni具有出色的CO2活化能力，即使在苛刻的反应条件下也能发挥作用。它将CO2解离成CO和活性氧（O*ads），后者可以再生还原的铬物种。

2. 改善氧化能力：Ni增强了CO2的氧化能力，使其能够将还原的Cr2+重新氧化为活性Cr3+状态，甚至进一步氧化为Cr6+。这有助于维持催化剂的活性位点。

3. 稳定的选择性：与可能显著降低丙烯选择性的O2共进料不同，Ni促进的催化剂在改善催化性能的同时保持了稳定的选择性。

4. 降低失活：与未促进的催化剂相比，Ni促进的催化剂表现出更低的失活率，从而导致随时间推移催化活性更加稳定。

5. 更高的CO2转化率：Ni促进的催化剂表现出更高的CO2转化率，表明CO2反应物的使用更加高效。

6. 稳定的丙烯产量：更高的CO2转化率和保持的选择性相结合，导致丙烯产量稳定，这是丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）反应的一个关键目标。

总之，Ni促进剂在增强CO2活化和氧化能力的同时保持选择性和稳定性，提供了一种更平衡的方法，使其在用于ODHP反应的铬基催化系统中比O2共进料更具优势。

[1] "CrOx/silica catalysts suffer from rapid deactivation15 because of coke deposition and CrOx reduction and so convert the coordinatively unsaturated Cr3+ state into the inactive Cr2+ state."

[2] "The oxidizing power can be improved by the addition of O2 in the reactant as a cofeed with CO2. The deactivation rate of the CrOx/silica catalyst was decreased by the addition of a small amount of O2.20 Unfortunately, the selectivity of the reaction for C3H6 was decreased significantly."

[3] "Ni-based catalysts are widely used in CO2 reforming reactions2123 and the reverse watergas shift (RWGS) reaction.24 Such catalysts have an excellent ability to activate CO2, even under harsh reaction conditions."

[4] "The chemisorbed CO2 undergoes a sequential carbonoxygen bond cleavage to generate CO and activated O (O*ads). Such O*ads generated on Ni could play a role in the reoxidation of the reduced CrOx species during the ODHP reaction."

[5] "By introducing Ni on the Cr/Si catalyst, catalyst deactivation can be reduced and the regeneration of active sites can be achieved."

Promoters like Ni address the limitations of CO2's weak oxidation potential in chromium-based catalytic systems by enhancing CO2 activation and improving its oxidizing ability. Ni-based catalysts have an excellent ability to activate CO2 even under harsh conditions. The chemisorbed CO2 on Ni undergoes cleavage to generate CO and activated oxygen (O*ads), which can reoxidize reduced CrOx species during the reaction.

Compared to O2 co-feeding, Ni promotion offers several advantages:

1. Selective oxidation: While O2 co-feeding can decrease catalyst deactivation, it significantly reduces selectivity for propylene. Ni promotion maintains selectivity while improving stability.

2. Regeneration of active sites: Ni enables the regeneration of active Cr3+ sites from inactive Cr2+, addressing a key deactivation mechanism.

3. Stable performance: By maintaining the active Cr3+ state, Ni-promoted catalysts show more stable catalytic performance over time compared to unpromoted catalysts.

4. No trade-off between activity and selectivity: Unlike O2 co-feeding which improves activity at the cost of selectivity, Ni promotion enhances both aspects simultaneously.

Overall, Ni promotion offers a more balanced approach to enhancing CO2 activation and catalyst stability while preserving selectivity in chromium-based oxidative dehydrogenation reactions.

Promoters like Ni address the limitations of CO2's weak oxidation potential in chromium-based catalytic systems by enhancing CO2 activation and improving its oxidizing ability. Ni specifically offers several advantages over alternative strategies like O2 co-feeding:

1. Enhanced CO2 activation: Ni promotes the dissociation of CO2 into CO and activated oxygen (O*ads), which can then reoxidize reduced chromium species.

2. Improved oxidizing ability: Ni enables CO2 to more effectively reoxidize reduced Cr2+ to active Cr3+ states, and even Cr3+ to Cr6+, maintaining the catalyst's active phase.

3. Selective and stable performance: Unlike O2 co-feeding, which decreases selectivity for propylene, Ni-promoted catalysts maintain high selectivity while improving stability. They show higher CO2 conversion and stable propylene production over time.

4. Reduced deactivation: Ni helps maintain the active Cr3+ state during the reaction, preventing the formation of inactive Cr2+ and thus reducing catalyst deactivation.

5. Avoiding trade-offs: O2 co-feeding decreases deactivation but significantly reduces propylene selectivity. Ni promotion achieves both improved stability and maintained selectivity without this trade-off.

These advantages make Ni promotion a more effective strategy for enhancing CO2 activation and achieving stable, selective catalytic performance in chromium-based oxidative dehydrogenation of propane with CO2.
