[1] "Nakagawa etal. reported that the surface Cr remained in a higher oxidation state in the presence of CO2 than in its absence in the oxidative dehydrogenation of lower alkanes. However, CO2 has limited oxidizing ability, in terms of reoxidation of the reduced CrOx, owing to its thermodynamically stable properties."

[2] "The oxidizing power can be improved by the addition of O2 in the reactant as a cofeed with CO2. The deactivation rate of the CrOx/silica catalyst was decreased by the addition of a small amount of O2. Unfortunately, the selectivity of the reaction for C3H6 was decreased significantly."

[3] "Ni-based catalysts are widely used in CO2 reforming reactions2123 and the reverse watergas shift (RWGS) reaction. Such catalysts have an excellent ability to activate CO2, even under harsh reaction conditions."

[4] "Here, we report on the preparation of a Ni-promoted CrOx/SBA-15 catalyst by using a sequential impregnation method to decrease the deactivation of the catalyst in the ODHP reaction."

[5] "The promotional activation of CO2 owed to the added Ni on the Cr/Si catalyst. The deactivation tendency of the 0.5Ni-Cr/Si catalyst was significantly lower than that of the non-promoted catalyst."

[6] "Higher conversion of CO2 and stable production of propylene imply that Ni dissociates CO2 to CO and O*ads, which regenerates the reduced Cr species Cr2+ to Cr3+ through reoxidation."

Promoters like nickel address the limitations of CO2's weak oxidation potential and inertness in chromium-based catalytic systems by enhancing CO2 activation and improving its oxidizing ability. Ni-based catalysts have an excellent ability to activate CO2 even under harsh reaction conditions. The addition of Ni to CrOx/SBA-15 catalysts decreases deactivation in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reaction.

Compared to O2 co-feeding, Ni promoters offer several advantages:

1. Improved selectivity: While O2 co-feeding decreases deactivation, it significantly reduces selectivity for propylene. Ni-promoted catalysts maintain stable propylene production.

2. Enhanced CO2 activation: Ni dissociates CO2 to CO and activated oxygen (O*ads), which regenerates reduced Cr species from Cr2+ to Cr3+.

3. Lower deactivation: Ni-promoted catalysts show significantly lower deactivation tendency compared to non-promoted catalysts.

4. Higher CO2 conversion: Ni promotion leads to higher CO2 conversion while maintaining stable propylene production.

5. Preservation of active sites: Ni helps maintain the active Cr3+ state during the reaction, whereas non-promoted catalysts quickly transform active Cr3+ to inactive Cr2+.

These advantages result in more selective and stable catalytic performance compared to O2 co-feeding, while effectively addressing CO2's inherent limitations as an oxidant in chromium-based systems.

像镍这样的助剂通过增强CO2的活化和改善其氧化能力，解决了CO2在铬基催化系统中氧化能力弱和惰性的限制。镍基催化剂即使在苛刻的反应条件下也具有出色的CO2活化能力。将镍添加到CrOx/SBA-15催化剂中可以减少丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）反应中的失活。

与O2共进料相比，镍助剂提供了以下几个优势：

1. 提高选择性：虽然O2共进料可以减少失活，但它显著降低了对丙烯的选择性。镍促进的催化剂保持稳定的丙烯产量。

2. 增强CO2活化：镍将CO2解离成CO和活性氧（O*ads），后者可以将还原态的Cr2+物种再生为Cr3+。

3. 降低失活：与未促进的催化剂相比，镍促进的催化剂显示出明显较低的失活趋势。

4. 更高的CO2转化率：镍的促进作用导致更高的CO2转化率，同时保持稳定的丙烯产量。

5. 保护活性位点：镍有助于在反应过程中保持活性Cr3+状态，而未促进的催化剂会迅速将活性Cr3+转化为非活性Cr2+。

这些优势导致比O2共进料更具选择性和稳定性的催化性能，同时有效解决了CO2作为氧化剂在铬基系统中的固有限制。
