[1] "CrOx/silica catalysts suffer from rapid deactivation15 because of coke deposition and CrOx reduction and so convert the coordinatively unsaturated Cr3+ state into the inactive Cr2+ state."

[2] "The oxidizing power can be improved by the addition of O2 in the reactant as a cofeed with CO2. The deactivation rate of the CrOx/silica catalyst was decreased by the addition of a small amount of O2.20 Unfortunately, the selectivity of the reaction for C3H6 was decreased significantly."

[3] "Ni-based catalysts are widely used in CO2 reforming reactions2123 and the reverse watergas shift (RWGS) reaction.24 Such catalysts have an excellent ability to activate CO2, even under harsh reaction conditions."

[4] "The chemisorbed CO2 undergoes a sequential carbonoxygen bond cleavage to generate CO and activated O (O*ads). Such O*ads generated on Ni could play a role in the reoxidation of the reduced CrOx species during the ODHP reaction."

[5] "By introducing Ni on the Cr/Si catalyst, catalyst deactivation can be reduced and the regeneration of active sites can be achieved."

Promoters like Ni address the limitations of CO2's weak oxidation potential in chromium-based catalytic systems by enhancing CO2 activation and improving its oxidizing ability. Ni-based catalysts have an excellent ability to activate CO2 even under harsh conditions. The chemisorbed CO2 on Ni undergoes cleavage to generate CO and activated oxygen (O*ads), which can reoxidize reduced CrOx species during the reaction.

Compared to O2 co-feeding, Ni promotion offers several advantages:

1. Selective oxidation: While O2 co-feeding can decrease catalyst deactivation, it significantly reduces selectivity for propylene. Ni promotion maintains selectivity while improving stability.

2. Regeneration of active sites: Ni enables the regeneration of active Cr3+ sites from inactive Cr2+, addressing a key deactivation mechanism.

3. Stable performance: By maintaining the active Cr3+ state, Ni-promoted catalysts show more stable catalytic performance over time compared to unpromoted catalysts.

4. No trade-off between activity and selectivity: Unlike O2 co-feeding which improves activity at the cost of selectivity, Ni promotion enhances both aspects simultaneously.

Overall, Ni promotion offers a more balanced approach to enhancing CO2 activation and catalyst stability while preserving selectivity in chromium-based oxidative dehydrogenation reactions.

像镍这样的助剂通过增强二氧化碳的活化和改善其氧化能力来解决铬基催化系统中二氧化碳氧化潜力弱的限制。镍基催化剂即使在苛刻条件下也具有出色的二氧化碳活化能力。在镍上吸附的二氧化碳会发生裂解，生成一氧化碳和活性氧（O*ads），后者可以在反应过程中重新氧化还原的CrOx物种。

与共进料氧气相比，镍助剂提供了几个优势：

1. 选择性氧化：虽然共进料氧气可以减少催化剂失活，但它显著降低了丙烯的选择性。镍助剂在提高稳定性的同时保持了选择性。

2. 活性位点再生：镍能够将无活性的Cr2+再生为活性Cr3+，解决了一个关键的失活机制。

3. 稳定性能：通过维持活性Cr3+状态，镍助剂催化剂与未添加助剂的催化剂相比，随时间推移表现出更稳定的催化性能。

4. 活性和选择性之间无权衡：与共进料氧气以牺牲选择性为代价提高活性不同，镍助剂同时增强了这两个方面。

总的来说，在铬基氧化脱氢反应中，镍助剂提供了一种更平衡的方法来增强二氧化碳活化和催化剂稳定性，同时保持选择性。
