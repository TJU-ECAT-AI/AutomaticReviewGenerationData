Read the questions and answers provided below. First, critically assess the overall relevance of the answers provided to the set of questions asked.

If, upon your assessment, you find that the answers do not contain information that is relevant to the questions asked, stop your review process immediately and respond with a single sentence: "※※※※※※※The provided answers are not relevant to the questions.※※※※※※※". Do not provide any additional explanation or background information, only this sentence should be given as a response in case of irrelevant answers.

If, however, the answers are relevant to the questions asked, proceed to compile answers for each question according to the instructions below. Ensure to aggregate all the relevant answers from the multiple answer results provided in the document, and organize them sequentially by their order number, compiling the corresponding quotes, English answers, and Chinese answers for each question.

If the provided answers' quotes are not differentiated by question, ensure to break them down and assign the quotes to each respective question, outputting them separately within each question's section.

To provide a comprehensive review, differentiate the responses into quotes, English answers, and Chinese answers for each question based on the details given in the 'Answer' XML tags. Structure your review using the XML format showcased below if the answers are relevant to the questions asked:

<EnglishVersionAnswer>

The given literature does not contain any information about promoters addressing limitations of CO2's weak oxidation potential and inertness in chromium-based catalytic systems, nor does it discuss advantages of promoters over O2 co-feeding for enhancing CO2 activation, improving oxidizing ability, or achieving selective and stable catalytic performance. The document appears to be only a title page of a manuscript about oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propylene with carbon dioxide, and does not provide any detailed content to answer the specific question posed.

</EnglishVersionAnswer>

<ChineseVersionAnswer>

给定的文献中没有关于促进剂如何解决CO2在铬基催化系统中弱氧化能力和惰性限制的信息，也没有讨论促进剂相对于O2共进料在增强CO2活化、改善氧化能力以及实现选择性和稳定催化性能方面的优势。这份文档似乎只是一个关于用二氧化碳进行丙烷氧化脱氢制丙烯的手稿标题页，没有提供任何详细内容来回答所提出的具体问题。

The given literature does not contain any information to answer this question. The abstract provided does not discuss promoters, chromium-based catalytic systems, CO2 activation, or comparisons with O2 co-feeding strategies for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane. More detailed content from the full paper would be needed to address these specific aspects of catalytic performance and reaction mechanisms.

</EnglishVersionAnswer>

<ChineseVersionAnswer>

所给文献中没有任何信息可以回答这个问题。提供的摘要没有讨论促进剂、基于铬的催化体系、CO2活化,或者与O2共进料策略在丙烷氧化脱氢方面的比较。需要完整论文的更详细内容才能解决这些有关催化性能和反应机理的具体方面。
