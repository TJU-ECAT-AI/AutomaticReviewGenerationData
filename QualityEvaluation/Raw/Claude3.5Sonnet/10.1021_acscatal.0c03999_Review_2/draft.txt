Enhancing CO2 activation and oxidizing ability in chromium-based catalytic systems: Challenges, strategies, and the role of promoters in improving performance and selectivity

Carbon dioxide (CO2) has emerged as a promising alternative oxidant for catalytic oxidative dehydrogenation of light alkanes to olefins, offering several advantages over conventional oxygen-based systems. However, CO2's weak oxidation potential and inertness present significant challenges in chromium-based catalytic systems. This review explores the strategies employed to address these limitations, with a focus on the role of promoters in enhancing CO2 activation, improving oxidizing ability, and achieving selective and stable catalytic performance.

Challenges of CO2 as an Oxidant:
CO2 has limited oxidizing ability due to its thermodynamically stable properties, making it difficult to reoxidize reduced CrOx species [10.1002/cctc.201200397]. Additionally, CO2 is quite inert and not easily activated by CrOx [10.1021/acscatal.0c03999_2]. These limitations result in lower efficiency of reoxidation compared to oxygen [10.1007/s11144-007-5089-1].

Strategies to Enhance CO2 Activation and Oxidizing Ability:

1. Promoter Addition:
The introduction of promoters is a key strategy to facilitate CO2 activation and improve its oxidizing ability [10.1021/acscatal.0c03999_2]. Several types of promoters have been investigated:

a) Nickel (Ni):
Ni has shown excellent ability to activate CO2, even under harsh reaction conditions [10.1002/cctc.201200397]. It enhances the oxidizing ability of CO2 by facilitating its dissociation to CO and adsorbed O*, which can then regenerate reduced chromium species [10.1002/cctc.201200397]. Ni-promoted catalysts demonstrate higher CO2 conversion rates and stable propylene production [10.1002/cctc.201200397].

b) Alkali Metal Oxides:
Due to their basic properties, alkali metal oxides promote CO2 adsorption and activation in CO2 hydrogenation reactions [10.1021/acscatal.0c03999_2]. Potassium (K) has been identified as an effective promoter, enhancing catalyst stability and selectivity [10.3103/S0361521912010089].

c) Ruthenium (Ru):
Ru is a potential promoter due to its high activity in CO2 hydrogenation, which can enhance the overall reaction process [10.1021/acscatal.0c03999_2].

2. Support Effects:
The choice of support material plays a crucial role in enhancing CO2 activation. Silica supports, especially at low chromium loadings, promote deep reduction of chromium to Cr2+, which is more easily reoxidized by CO2 than Cr3+ [10.1007/s11144-007-5089-1].

3. Redox Cycle Mechanism:
In some chromium-based catalysts, such as CrOx/MCM-41, the reverse water-gas shift (RWGS) reaction proceeds via a redox cycle. This cycle involves the reduction of Cr3+ to Cr2+ by hydrogen from propane dehydrogenation, followed by reoxidation of Cr2+ by CO2 [10.1007/s11144-007-5089-1].

Advantages over O2 Co-feeding:

1. Improved Selectivity:
CO2, being a milder oxidant compared to O2, shifts the oxidative dehydrogenation reaction towards more olefin production by preventing deep oxidation of reactive olefins [10.1016/j.jcat.2019.02.026]. This results in higher selectivity for the desired products.

2. Stable Catalytic Performance:
Promoters like Ni and K help maintain stable catalytic activity and selectivity over extended periods, unlike O2 co-feeding which can lead to significant selectivity drops [10.1002/cctc.201200397] [10.3103/S0361521912010089].

3. Reduced Coke Formation:
CO2 can inhibit coke formation and, in some cases, gasify existing coke through the reverse Boudouard reaction [10.1016/j.jcat.2019.02.026]. This helps in maintaining catalyst stability and prolonging catalyst lifetime.

4. Thermodynamic Equilibrium Shift:
CO2 consumes hydrogen species through the RWGS reaction, which enhances the equilibrium of light alkane conversion [10.1016/j.jcat.2019.02.026].

5. Prevention of Over-oxidation:
CO2 prevents the over-reduction of active oxidative chromium species by consuming excess hydrogen, maintaining the catalyst in its active state [10.1016/j.jcat.2019.02.026].

Integrative understanding and prospective outlook:

The development of promoters to enhance CO2 activation and oxidizing ability in chromium-based catalytic systems represents a significant advancement in the field of oxidative dehydrogenation of light alkanes. The use of CO2 as an oxidant, coupled with carefully selected promoters, offers a more sustainable and selective approach compared to traditional O2-based systems.

Future research directions may include:

1. Exploration of novel promoter combinations: Investigating synergistic effects between different promoters (e.g., Ni-K or Ru-Ni combinations) could lead to further improvements in catalyst performance and stability.

2. In-depth mechanistic studies: Advanced characterization techniques could be employed to elucidate the precise mechanisms by which promoters enhance CO2 activation and influence the catalyst's redox properties.

3. Development of new support materials: Creation of novel support materials or modification of existing ones to further enhance CO2 activation and promote the desired redox cycles.

4. Process intensification: Integration of membrane technology or other separation techniques to continuously remove products and shift equilibrium, potentially leading to higher conversions and yields.

5. Computational modeling: Utilizing density functional theory (DFT) and other computational methods to predict and design optimal promoter-catalyst combinations for specific reactions.

6. Scale-up studies: Investigating the performance of promoted catalysts under industrially relevant conditions to address potential challenges in large-scale applications.

7. Life cycle assessment: Conducting comprehensive environmental impact studies to quantify the potential benefits of CO2-based oxidative dehydrogenation processes compared to conventional methods.

By pursuing these research directions, it may be possible to develop even more efficient and sustainable catalytic systems for the production of valuable olefins from light alkanes, while simultaneously contributing to CO2 utilization efforts.
