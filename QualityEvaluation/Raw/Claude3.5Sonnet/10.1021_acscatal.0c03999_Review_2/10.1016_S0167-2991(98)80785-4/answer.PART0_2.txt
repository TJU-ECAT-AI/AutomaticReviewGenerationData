[1] "The promoting effects of carbon dioxide over a Cr203/SiO2 catalyst were to enhance the yield of C3H6 and to suppress the catalyst deactivation."

[2] "The results shown in Figure 3 clearly indicate that the presence of CO2 markedly improved the yield of C3H6. This catalytic performance is a proof that CO2 plays a promoting role in the conversion of C3H8 to C3H6 over a Cr203/SiO2 catalyst."

[3] "Accordingly, these findings suggest that the surface of Cr203 on a Cr203/SiO2 catalyst could be reduced during the dehydrogenation of C3H8 in the absence of CO2, whereas the surface of Cr203 might be maintained partially oxidized during the reaction in the presence of CO2."

[4] "The partially oxidized Cr203 supported on SiO2 catalyst is active for the dehydrogenation of C3H8. In the presence of CO2, the surface of Cr203/SiO2 might be maintained partially oxidized during the reaction."

The literature does not directly address how promoters overcome CO2's weak oxidation potential in chromium-based catalysts, nor does it compare CO2 to O2 co-feeding. However, it does provide insights into how CO2 acts as a promoter in Cr2O3/SiO2 catalytic systems:

1. CO2 enhances the yield of C3H6 in propane dehydrogenation and suppresses catalyst deactivation.

2. CO2 maintains the Cr2O3 surface in a partially oxidized state during the reaction, which is more active for propane dehydrogenation than a fully reduced surface.

3. The promoting effect of CO2 is specific to SiO2-supported Cr2O3 catalysts, suggesting that the interaction between Cr2O3 and SiO2 is crucial for CO2 activation.

4. The boundaries between Cr2O3 and SiO2 particles may play an important role in the promoting effect of CO2.

While these findings don't directly compare CO2 to O2 co-feeding, they suggest that CO2 offers advantages in terms of maintaining catalyst activity and stability by keeping the chromium in a partially oxidized state, which may be difficult to achieve with O2 due to its stronger oxidizing nature.

该文献没有直接讨论促进剂如何克服CO2在铬基催化剂中的弱氧化能力，也没有将CO2与O2共进料进行比较。但是，它确实提供了CO2如何在Cr2O3/SiO2催化系统中作为促进剂的见解：

1. CO2提高了丙烷脱氢反应中C3H6的产率，并抑制了催化剂的失活。

2. 在反应过程中，CO2使Cr2O3表面保持部分氧化状态，这种状态比完全还原的表面更有利于丙烷脱氢反应。

3. CO2的促进作用仅在SiO2负载的Cr2O3催化剂上表现出来，这表明Cr2O3和SiO2之间的相互作用对CO2的活化至关重要。

4. Cr2O3和SiO2颗粒之间的界面可能在CO2的促进作用中起重要作用。

虽然这些发现没有直接将CO2与O2共进料进行比较，但它们表明CO2在保持催化剂活性和稳定性方面具有优势，因为它能使铬保持在部分氧化状态。由于O2的氧化性更强，可能难以用O2达到这种效果。
