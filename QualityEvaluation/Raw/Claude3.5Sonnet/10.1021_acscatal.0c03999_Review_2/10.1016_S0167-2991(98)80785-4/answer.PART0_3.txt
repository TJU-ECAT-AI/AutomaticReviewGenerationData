[1] "Carbon dioxide exerted promoting effects only on SiO2-supported Cr203 catalyst. The promoting effects of carbon dioxide over a Cr203/SiO2 catalyst were to enhance the yield of C3H6 and to suppress the catalyst deactivation."

[2] "The presence of CO2 markedly improved the yield of C3H6. This catalytic performance is a proof that CO2 plays a promoting role in the conversion of C3H8 to C3H6 over a Cr203/SiO2 catalyst."

[3] "The decrease in the yield of C3H6 was found much less in the presence of CO2 than in the absence of CO2. This finding suggests that the addition of CO2 could suppress the deactivation of the catalyst."

[4] "These findings suggest that the surface of Cr203 on a Cr203/SiO2 catalyst could be reduced during the dehydrogenation of C3H8 in the absence of CO2, whereas the surface of Cr203 might be maintained partially oxidized during the reaction in the presence of CO2."

The literature does not directly address how promoters enhance CO2's weak oxidation potential or compare CO2 to O2 co-feeding. However, it does provide insights into the specific advantages of using CO2 in chromium-based catalytic systems:

1. CO2 acts as a promoter specifically for SiO2-supported Cr2O3 catalysts in the dehydrogenation of propane to propylene.

2. The addition of CO2 enhances the yield of propylene (C3H6) in the reaction.

3. CO2 helps suppress catalyst deactivation, leading to more stable performance over time.

4. CO2 maintains the surface of Cr2O3 in a partially oxidized state during the reaction, which appears to be beneficial for catalytic activity.

These effects suggest that CO2 plays a role in modifying the oxidation state of the chromium catalyst, which may be key to its promoting effects. While the study doesn't directly compare CO2 to O2 co-feeding, the ability of CO2 to maintain a partially oxidized catalyst surface while simultaneously improving yield and stability could potentially offer advantages over more aggressive oxidants like O2.

文献并未直接讨论促进剂如何增强CO2的弱氧化潜力，也没有将CO2与O2共馈进行比较。但是，它确实提供了关于在铬基催化系统中使用CO2的具体优势的见解：

1. CO2作为专门针对SiO2负载的Cr2O3催化剂在丙烷脱氢制丙烯反应中的促进剂。

2. 添加CO2可以提高反应中丙烯（C3H6）的产率。

3. CO2有助于抑制催化剂失活，从而导致随时间推移性能更加稳定。

4. CO2在反应过程中保持Cr2O3表面处于部分氧化状态，这似乎对催化活性有益。

这些效果表明，CO2在改变铬催化剂的氧化状态方面发挥了作用，这可能是其促进效果的关键。虽然该研究没有直接将CO2与O2共馈进行比较，但CO2能够在维持催化剂表面部分氧化的同时提高产率和稳定性，这可能比O2等更具侵略性的氧化剂具有优势。
