[1] "The promoting effects of carbon dioxide over a Cr203/SiO2 catalyst were to enhance the yield of C3H6 and to suppress the catalyst deactivation."

[2] "The surface of Cr203 on a Cr203/SiO2 catalyst could be reduced during the dehydrogenation of C3H8 in the absence of CO2, whereas the surface of Cr203 might be maintained partially oxidized during the reaction in the presence of CO2."

[3] "The partially oxidized Cr203 supported on SiO2 catalyst is active for the dehydrogenation of C3H8. In the presence of CO2, the surface of Cr203/SiO2 might be maintained partially oxidized during the reaction."

The literature does not directly address how promoters overcome CO2's weak oxidation potential or compare CO2 to O2 co-feeding. However, it does provide insights into how CO2 promotes catalytic performance in chromium-based systems:

1. CO2 enhances the yield of C3H6 and suppresses catalyst deactivation in Cr2O3/SiO2 catalysts.

2. CO2 helps maintain the Cr2O3 surface in a partially oxidized state during the reaction, whereas without CO2, the surface becomes reduced.

3. The partially oxidized state of Cr2O3 supported on SiO2 is active for propane dehydrogenation.

These findings suggest that CO2 acts as a mild oxidant, helping to maintain the catalyst in an optimal oxidation state for the reaction. This could potentially offer advantages over O2 co-feeding in terms of selectivity and stability, as O2 might over-oxidize the catalyst or lead to unwanted side reactions. However, the literature does not provide a direct comparison to O2 co-feeding or discuss specific promoters beyond CO2 itself.

该文献并未直接讨论促进剂如何克服CO2的弱氧化能力，也没有将CO2与O2共进料进行比较。但是，它确实提供了关于CO2如何在铬基催化系统中促进催化性能的见解：

1. CO2提高了Cr2O3/SiO2催化剂中C3H6的产率，并抑制了催化剂失活。

2. CO2有助于在反应过程中保持Cr2O3表面处于部分氧化状态，而在没有CO2的情况下，表面会被还原。

3. 负载在SiO2上的部分氧化态Cr2O3对丙烷脱氢反应是活性的。

这些发现表明，CO2作为一种温和的氧化剂，有助于将催化剂维持在反应的最佳氧化状态。这可能在选择性和稳定性方面比O2共进料具有优势，因为O2可能会过度氧化催化剂或导致不希望的副反应。然而，该文献并未直接与O2共进料进行比较，也未讨论除CO2本身以外的特定促进剂。
