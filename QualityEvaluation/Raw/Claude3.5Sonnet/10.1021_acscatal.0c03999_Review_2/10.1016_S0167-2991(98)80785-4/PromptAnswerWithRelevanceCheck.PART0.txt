[1] "Carbon dioxide exerted promoting effects only on SiO2-supported Cr203 catalyst. The promoting effects of carbon dioxide over a Cr203/SiO2 catalyst were to enhance the yield of C3H6 and to suppress the catalyst deactivation."

[2] "The ratio of C3H6 yield in the reaction in the presence of CO2 to that in the absence of CO2 decreased with increasing Cr203 content in the Cr203/SiO2 catalyst, as shown Figure 4. This suggests that the boundaries between Cr203 and SiO2 particles might have an important role in the promoting effect of CO2."

[3] "Accordingly, these findings suggest that the surface of Cr203 on a Cr203/SiO2 catalyst could be reduced during the dehydrogenation of C3H8 in the absence of CO2, whereas the surface of Cr203 might be maintained partially oxidized during the reaction in the presence of CO2."

[4] "These findings confirm that partially oxidized Cr203/SiO2 catalyst could be more active for the dehydrogenation of C3H8 than a reduced catalyst."

The literature does not directly compare CO2 promoters to O2 co-feeding or discuss CO2's weak oxidation potential. However, it does provide insights into how CO2 acts as a promoter in chromium-based catalytic systems:

1. CO2 enhances C3H6 yield and suppresses catalyst deactivation, but only on SiO2-supported Cr2O3 catalysts.

2. The promoting effect appears to be related to the boundaries between Cr2O3 and SiO2 particles, suggesting a unique interaction between CO2 and the catalyst support.

3. CO2 helps maintain the Cr2O3 surface in a partially oxidized state during the reaction, which is more active for propane dehydrogenation than a reduced catalyst.

4. This partially oxidized state likely contributes to the improved catalyst stability and performance.

While the document doesn't directly compare CO2 to O2 co-feeding, the ability of CO2 to maintain a partially oxidized catalyst state while also producing valuable C3H6 suggests potential advantages over O2 co-feeding in terms of selectivity and process efficiency. However, more direct comparisons would be needed to fully assess the relative benefits.

虽然文献没有直接比较CO2促进剂和O2共进料，也没有讨论CO2的弱氧化潜力，但它确实提供了关于CO2如何在铬基催化系统中作为促进剂的见解：

1. CO2提高了C3H6的产率并抑制了催化剂失活，但这只在SiO2负载的Cr2O3催化剂上有效。

2. 促进效果似乎与Cr2O3和SiO2颗粒之间的界面有关，这表明CO2与催化剂载体之间存在独特的相互作用。

3. 在反应过程中，CO2有助于保持Cr2O3表面处于部分氧化状态，这种状态对丙烷脱氢更为活跃，比还原态的催化剂更有效。

4. 这种部分氧化状态可能有助于提高催化剂的稳定性和性能。

虽然文档没有直接比较CO2和O2共进料，但CO2能够在生产有价值的C3H6的同时保持催化剂的部分氧化状态，这表明在选择性和过程效率方面可能比O2共进料有优势。然而，需要更直接的比较才能全面评估相对优势。

The literature does not directly address how promoters overcome CO2's weak oxidation potential or compare CO2 to O2 co-feeding. However, it does provide insights into how CO2 promotes catalytic performance in chromium-based systems:

1. CO2 enhances the yield of C3H6 and suppresses catalyst deactivation in Cr2O3/SiO2 catalysts.

2. CO2 helps maintain the Cr2O3 surface in a partially oxidized state during the reaction, whereas without CO2, the surface becomes reduced.

3. The partially oxidized state of Cr2O3 supported on SiO2 is active for propane dehydrogenation.

These findings suggest that CO2 acts as a mild oxidant, helping to maintain the catalyst in an optimal oxidation state for the reaction. This could potentially offer advantages over O2 co-feeding in terms of selectivity and stability, as O2 might over-oxidize the catalyst or lead to unwanted side reactions. However, the literature does not provide a direct comparison to O2 co-feeding or discuss specific promoters beyond CO2 itself.

该文献并未直接讨论促进剂如何克服CO2的弱氧化能力，也没有将CO2与O2共进料进行比较。但是，它确实提供了关于CO2如何在铬基催化系统中促进催化性能的见解：

1. CO2提高了Cr2O3/SiO2催化剂中C3H6的产率，并抑制了催化剂失活。

2. CO2有助于在反应过程中保持Cr2O3表面处于部分氧化状态，而在没有CO2的情况下，表面会被还原。

3. 负载在SiO2上的部分氧化态Cr2O3对丙烷脱氢反应是活性的。

这些发现表明，CO2作为一种温和的氧化剂，有助于将催化剂维持在反应的最佳氧化状态。这可能在选择性和稳定性方面比O2共进料具有优势，因为O2可能会过度氧化催化剂或导致不希望的副反应。然而，该文献并未直接与O2共进料进行比较，也未讨论除CO2本身以外的特定促进剂。

1. CO2 enhances the yield of C3H6 in propane dehydrogenation and suppresses catalyst deactivation.

4. The boundaries between Cr2O3 and SiO2 particles may play an important role in the promoting effect of CO2.

While these findings don't directly compare CO2 to O2 co-feeding, they suggest that CO2 offers advantages in terms of maintaining catalyst activity and stability by keeping the chromium in a partially oxidized state, which may be difficult to achieve with O2 due to its stronger oxidizing nature.

虽然这些发现没有直接将CO2与O2共进料进行比较，但它们表明CO2在保持催化剂活性和稳定性方面具有优势，因为它能使铬保持在部分氧化状态。由于O2的氧化性更强，可能难以用O2达到这种效果。

The literature does not directly address how promoters enhance CO2's weak oxidation potential or compare CO2 to O2 co-feeding. However, it does provide insights into the specific advantages of using CO2 in chromium-based catalytic systems:

1. CO2 acts as a promoter specifically for SiO2-supported Cr2O3 catalysts in the dehydrogenation of propane to propylene.

2. The addition of CO2 enhances the yield of propylene (C3H6) in the reaction.

3. CO2 helps suppress catalyst deactivation, leading to more stable performance over time.

4. CO2 maintains the surface of Cr2O3 in a partially oxidized state during the reaction, which appears to be beneficial for catalytic activity.

These effects suggest that CO2 plays a role in modifying the oxidation state of the chromium catalyst, which may be key to its promoting effects. While the study doesn't directly compare CO2 to O2 co-feeding, the ability of CO2 to maintain a partially oxidized catalyst surface while simultaneously improving yield and stability could potentially offer advantages over more aggressive oxidants like O2.

文献并未直接讨论促进剂如何增强CO2的弱氧化潜力，也没有将CO2与O2共馈进行比较。但是，它确实提供了关于在铬基催化系统中使用CO2的具体优势的见解：

1. CO2作为专门针对SiO2负载的Cr2O3催化剂在丙烷脱氢制丙烯反应中的促进剂。

2. 添加CO2可以提高反应中丙烯（C3H6）的产率。

3. CO2有助于抑制催化剂失活，从而导致随时间推移性能更加稳定。

4. CO2在反应过程中保持Cr2O3表面处于部分氧化状态，这似乎对催化活性有益。

这些效果表明，CO2在改变铬催化剂的氧化状态方面发挥了作用，这可能是其促进效果的关键。虽然该研究没有直接将CO2与O2共馈进行比较，但CO2能够在维持催化剂表面部分氧化的同时提高产率和稳定性，这可能比O2等更具侵略性的氧化剂具有优势。

The literature does not directly compare CO2 promoters to O2 co-feeding or discuss CO2's weak oxidation potential. However, it does highlight several advantages of using CO2 as a promoter in chromium-based catalytic systems:

1. Enhanced yield: CO2 improved the yield of C3H6 in the dehydrogenation of C3H8 over a Cr2O3/SiO2 catalyst.

2. Suppressed deactivation: The presence of CO2 reduced catalyst deactivation, maintaining higher activity over time compared to reactions without CO2.

3. Surface oxidation: CO2 helps maintain the Cr2O3 surface in a partially oxidized state during the reaction, which appears to be beneficial for catalyst activity and stability.

4. Selective promotion: The promoting effects of CO2 were only observed on SiO2-supported Cr2O3 catalysts, suggesting a specific interaction between CO2, the chromium active sites, and the silica support.

These benefits suggest that CO2 can act as an effective promoter in certain chromium-based catalytic systems, potentially offering advantages over other oxidizing agents in terms of selectivity and stability. However, without direct comparison to O2 co-feeding or other strategies, it's not possible to definitively state the relative advantages of CO2 promotion in all aspects of catalyst performance.

该文献并未直接比较CO2促进剂与O2共进料，也没有讨论CO2的弱氧化能力。但是，它确实强调了在铬基催化系统中使用CO2作为促进剂的几个优点：

1. 提高产率：在Cr2O3/SiO2催化剂上进行C3H8脱氢反应时，CO2提高了C3H6的产率。

2. 抑制失活：CO2的存在减少了催化剂的失活，与没有CO2的反应相比，能够长时间保持较高的活性。

3. 表面氧化：CO2有助于在反应过程中保持Cr2O3表面处于部分氧化状态，这似乎有利于催化剂的活性和稳定性。

4. 选择性促进：CO2的促进作用仅在SiO2负载的Cr2O3催化剂上观察到，这表明CO2、铬活性位点和二氧化硅载体之间存在特定的相互作用。

这些优点表明，CO2可以在某些铬基催化系统中作为有效的促进剂，在选择性和稳定性方面可能比其他氧化剂具有优势。然而，由于缺乏与O2共进料或其他策略的直接比较，无法确定地说明CO2促进在催化剂性能的所有方面相对于其他方法的优势。
