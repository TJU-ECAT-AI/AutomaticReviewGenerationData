[1] "Carbon dioxide exerted promoting effects only on SiO2-supported Cr203 catalyst. The promoting effects of carbon dioxide over a Cr203/SiO2 catalyst were to enhance the yield of C3H6 and to suppress the catalyst deactivation."

[2] "The ratio of C3H6 yield in the reaction in the presence of CO2 to that in the absence of CO2 decreased with increasing Cr203 content in the Cr203/SiO2 catalyst, as shown Figure 4. This suggests that the boundaries between Cr203 and SiO2 particles might have an important role in the promoting effect of CO2."

[3] "Accordingly, these findings suggest that the surface of Cr203 on a Cr203/SiO2 catalyst could be reduced during the dehydrogenation of C3H8 in the absence of CO2, whereas the surface of Cr203 might be maintained partially oxidized during the reaction in the presence of CO2."

[4] "These findings confirm that partially oxidized Cr203/SiO2 catalyst could be more active for the dehydrogenation of C3H8 than a reduced catalyst."

The literature does not directly compare CO2 promoters to O2 co-feeding or discuss CO2's weak oxidation potential. However, it does provide insights into how CO2 acts as a promoter in chromium-based catalytic systems:

1. CO2 enhances C3H6 yield and suppresses catalyst deactivation, but only on SiO2-supported Cr2O3 catalysts.

2. The promoting effect appears to be related to the boundaries between Cr2O3 and SiO2 particles, suggesting a unique interaction between CO2 and the catalyst support.

3. CO2 helps maintain the Cr2O3 surface in a partially oxidized state during the reaction, which is more active for propane dehydrogenation than a reduced catalyst.

4. This partially oxidized state likely contributes to the improved catalyst stability and performance.

While the document doesn't directly compare CO2 to O2 co-feeding, the ability of CO2 to maintain a partially oxidized catalyst state while also producing valuable C3H6 suggests potential advantages over O2 co-feeding in terms of selectivity and process efficiency. However, more direct comparisons would be needed to fully assess the relative benefits.

虽然文献没有直接比较CO2促进剂和O2共进料，也没有讨论CO2的弱氧化潜力，但它确实提供了关于CO2如何在铬基催化系统中作为促进剂的见解：

1. CO2提高了C3H6的产率并抑制了催化剂失活，但这只在SiO2负载的Cr2O3催化剂上有效。

2. 促进效果似乎与Cr2O3和SiO2颗粒之间的界面有关，这表明CO2与催化剂载体之间存在独特的相互作用。

3. 在反应过程中，CO2有助于保持Cr2O3表面处于部分氧化状态，这种状态对丙烷脱氢更为活跃，比还原态的催化剂更有效。

4. 这种部分氧化状态可能有助于提高催化剂的稳定性和性能。

虽然文档没有直接比较CO2和O2共进料，但CO2能够在生产有价值的C3H6的同时保持催化剂的部分氧化状态，这表明在选择性和过程效率方面可能比O2共进料有优势。然而，需要更直接的比较才能全面评估相对优势。
