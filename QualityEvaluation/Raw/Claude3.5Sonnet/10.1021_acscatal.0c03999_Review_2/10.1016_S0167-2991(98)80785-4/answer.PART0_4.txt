[1] "Carbon dioxide exerted promoting effects only on SiO2-supported Cr203 catalyst. The promoting effects of carbon dioxide over a Cr203/SiO2 catalyst were to enhance the yield of C3H6 and to suppress the catalyst deactivation."

[2] "The presence of CO2 markedly improved the yield of C3H6. This catalytic performance is a proof that CO2 plays a promoting role in the conversion of C3H8 to C3H6 over a Cr203/SiO2 catalyst."

[3] "The decrease in the yield of C3H6 was found much less in the presence of CO2 than in the absence of CO2. This finding suggests that the addition of CO2 could suppress the deactivation of the catalyst."

[4] "CO2 could oxidize some part of the surface of Cr203 in the catalyst. Accordingly, these findings suggest that the surface of Cr203 on a Cr203/SiO2 catalyst could be reduced during the dehydrogenation of C3H8 in the absence of CO2, whereas the surface of Cr203 might be maintained partially oxidized during the reaction in the presence of CO2."

The literature does not directly compare CO2 promoters to O2 co-feeding or discuss CO2's weak oxidation potential. However, it does highlight several advantages of using CO2 as a promoter in chromium-based catalytic systems:

1. Enhanced yield: CO2 improved the yield of C3H6 in the dehydrogenation of C3H8 over a Cr2O3/SiO2 catalyst.

2. Suppressed deactivation: The presence of CO2 reduced catalyst deactivation, maintaining higher activity over time compared to reactions without CO2.

3. Surface oxidation: CO2 helps maintain the Cr2O3 surface in a partially oxidized state during the reaction, which appears to be beneficial for catalyst activity and stability.

4. Selective promotion: The promoting effects of CO2 were only observed on SiO2-supported Cr2O3 catalysts, suggesting a specific interaction between CO2, the chromium active sites, and the silica support.

These benefits suggest that CO2 can act as an effective promoter in certain chromium-based catalytic systems, potentially offering advantages over other oxidizing agents in terms of selectivity and stability. However, without direct comparison to O2 co-feeding or other strategies, it's not possible to definitively state the relative advantages of CO2 promotion in all aspects of catalyst performance.

该文献并未直接比较CO2促进剂与O2共进料，也没有讨论CO2的弱氧化能力。但是，它确实强调了在铬基催化系统中使用CO2作为促进剂的几个优点：

1. 提高产率：在Cr2O3/SiO2催化剂上进行C3H8脱氢反应时，CO2提高了C3H6的产率。

2. 抑制失活：CO2的存在减少了催化剂的失活，与没有CO2的反应相比，能够长时间保持较高的活性。

3. 表面氧化：CO2有助于在反应过程中保持Cr2O3表面处于部分氧化状态，这似乎有利于催化剂的活性和稳定性。

4. 选择性促进：CO2的促进作用仅在SiO2负载的Cr2O3催化剂上观察到，这表明CO2、铬活性位点和二氧化硅载体之间存在特定的相互作用。

这些优点表明，CO2可以在某些铬基催化系统中作为有效的促进剂，在选择性和稳定性方面可能比其他氧化剂具有优势。然而，由于缺乏与O2共进料或其他策略的直接比较，无法确定地说明CO2促进在催化剂性能的所有方面相对于其他方法的优势。
