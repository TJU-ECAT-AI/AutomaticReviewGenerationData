A
lthough the chemical diversity of ordered composite meso-
porous materials has been expanding during the past decade113,
progress has been limited by the need for a general synthetic
approach that is predictive and makes use ofwell developed fundamen-
tal chemical principles. Researchers have previously used the interac-
tion of organicinorganic (OI) species that are present during the
nucleation of the composite phase, and several synthesis pathways,
such as direct surfactantinorganic interaction (S+I, SI+, S0I0) and
mediated interaction (S+XI+,SX+I),have been proposed2,3.Here we
describe a new perspective in which the self-adjusted inorganic
inorganic (II) interplay between two or more inorganic precursors is
guided by acidbase chemistry considerations,and in this simple way
we produce an overall frameworkfor the sophisticated combination
of synergic inorganic acidbase precursor pairs. We propose several
new routes and demonstrate their versatility and validity through the
successful syntheses of a wide variety of highly ordered, large-pore,
homogeneous,stable and multicomponent mesostructured minerals,
including metal phosphates and metal borates,as well as various metal
oxides and mixed metal oxides. We show that the highly ordered
mesostructured metal phosphates can be moulded into morphologies
ofchoice,and that they show interesting physicochemical properties.
Our general acidbase pairprinciples for rational combinations of
inorganic precursors are depicted in Fig. 1a.Various metallic and non-
metallic sources are sorted according to their relative acidity and
alkalinity on solvation (see detailed classification by dissociation
constant Kin Supplementary Information).In the selection of possible
pair combinations, normally the larger the acidity or alkalinity
difference between the metallic and/or non-metallic sources, the more
effectively the pairs will form and function. No extra reagents (such as
HCl (aq) or NH3 (aq)) are added to adjust the pH of the desired solgel
reactions during the entire preparation. Instead, we use two or more
inorganic species as depicted in Fig. 1 to self-generate a reaction
medium with the correct acidity to favour the solgel process of the
solvated products, and give a self-adjusted solgel synthesis. The
solvents used must be polar organic solvents.Amphoteric solvents,such
as C2H5OH or CH3OH,are recommended because they can easily act as
oxygen donors and aid proton transfer within the synthetic system. In
the acidbase pair approach that is proposed here, two or more
inorganic precursors chosen on the basis of their acidbase properties
are used to promote the assembly of ordered mesostructured materials.
This concept and methodology has not to our knowledge been
previously reported. Non-aqueous synthetic media are used to
maximize the utility of this method, choosing a solvent that is
compatible with the acidbase, solvolysis, inorganicinorganic 
and polymerization reactions of the different inorganic acidbase
precursor reactants.
Routes A, B and E (see Fig. 1) are new routes for the preparation of
mesoporous materials and are reminiscent of the well-known non-
hydrolytic solgel process which produces molecular homogeneous
oxides14,15.Routes C and D have been partially demonstrated previously
for example, syntheses of mesoporous silica2,6 or aluminophosphate16
through route C and syntheses of mesostructured metal chalcogenide17
through route Dand are not the focus ofthe current work.Routes F and
G are experimentally proven to be less effective,and both function poorly,
as suggested in the acidbase pairs diagram. Multiple combinations of
various ofthe above routes (such asroute A + route B) offer precise design
and control ofthe inorganic solgel process.
This new acidbase pair concept is particularly important for the
preparation of
multicomponent mesoporous materials.
The
multicomponent assembly can be guided by the relative acidbase
character of all the species present, so to assemble a multicomponent 
(I1,I2) composition,it is necessary to match acidbase interactions ofthe
various species present during nucleation of the mesostructured phases
in the order I1I2 >> I1I1, I2I2; and O(I1I2) >> OI1, OI2. NMR and
ultravioletvisible spectra (see Supplementary Information) suggest
that precursors with a large difference in intrinsic acidbase character
(quantified by pK values and/or related reactions) tend to form stable
pairs rather than isolated species, and thus achieve an I1I2 dominated
solgel reaction. Examples are alkoxides (esters) and anhydrous
chlorides (such as Ti(OCH2CH3)4 + PCl3).
Here we detail general syntheses and characterizations of
mesoporous metal phosphates to demonstrate this concept.Before now,
mesoporous or mesostructured metal phosphates of aluminium16,18,
titanium19,20, zirconium21,22, vanadium23,24, iron25, zinc2,26 and tin27,28
have been only sporadically reported. The thermal stabilities and/or
structural regularities of those materials are usually less than desired.
Using acidbase pair chemistry, we have synthesized various
mesoscopically ordered, large-pore, homogeneous and stable metal

phosphates with designed morphologies. For example, ordered
mesoporous titanium phosphate (TiPO) can be obtained by carefully
selecting appropriate acidbase pair precursors (see Fig. 1b and
Supplementary Information). Using the PCl3Ti(OC3H7)4 pair as
inorganic precursors and triblock copolymer Pluronic P123
(EO70PO20EO70) as the organic template (P123/(Ti + P) molar ratio of
1.21.6 × 102), we successfully prepared mesoporous TiPO. This
material after calcination gives a resolved X-ray diffraction (XRD)
pattern, and when this is combined with careful transmission electron
microscopy (TEM), these Bragg peaks can be indexed as (100), and
overlapped (110) and (200) of the two-dimensional hexagonal
mesostructure (space group p6m) (Fig. 2a, curve A). Nitrogen (N2)
sorption measurements show typical type IV isotherms similar to that
for mesoporous silica, indicating that highly ordered mesoporous
domains in the TiPO products are formed.The pore size calculated from
the N2 adsorption branch based on the BarrettJoynerHalanda (BJH)
model is centred at 5.4 nm with narrow distribution (full width at half
maximum,FWHM=1.0nm).The BET surface area is around 220m2g1,
which is very reasonable when considering the density, lack of
microporosity and large pore size of the product. Mesoporous TiPO
prepared with a higher P123/(Ti + P) ratio of 1.82.1×102shows four
resolved diffraction peaks (Fig. 2a,curve B),and when this is combined
with the TEM and selected-area electron diffraction (SAED) patterns
(see Supplementary Information),these peaks can roughly be indexed as
(211), (220), (321) and (332) in the space group Ia3d. Typical TEM
images of characteristic projections of the cubic Ia3d structure along
[111] and [311] directions are shown in Fig. 3a, and projections on the
(110) and (100) planes of hexagonal mesoporous TiPO are shown in
Fig. 3b. Further increase of the copolymer/(Ti + P) ratio to above
2.3 × 102 results in the formation of a thermally unstable lamellar
mesostructure (Fig. 2a,curve C).
Body-centred cubic mesoporous TiPO can be synthesized by using
the same acidbase pairs
, but another triblock copolymer, F108
(EO132PO50EO132) as a structure-directing agent. XRD pattern (Fig. 2a,
curve D),N2sorption curves and careful TEM observations all reveal the
ordered cubic (Im3m) mesostructure with a large cage pore size (9.8 nm).
Other ordered and stable mesoporous metal phosphates (AlPO,
NbPO,ZrPO and CePO)can also be successfully prepared.TEM images
of those samples shown in Fig. 3cf clearly confirm their structural
variety (hexagonal or cubic) and quality (high ordering in domains at
least 0.6 m2). XRD patterns of the representative AlPO, NbPO, ZrPO
and CePO samples are shown in Fig. 2b, also indicating that these
compositions have ordered hexagonal or cubic mesostructured
inorganic frameworks.
Although different synthetic routes and different phosphorus
sources were used to prepare the various phosphate mesostructures
with framework metal/phosphorus ratios of 1.0, the results of 31P
magic-angle spinning (MAS) NMR show very similar chemical shifts.
The P chemical shifts for mesoporous TiPO,AlPO,NbPO and ZrPO are
centred at about 25 to 27, 23 to 25, 16 to 19 and 20 to 22,
respectively. The broad distribution of the signal suggests the
amorphous nature of the mesopore walls. X-ray photoelectron
spectroscopy (XPS) data confirm that the P atoms have  valence Vin all
calcined samples, regardless of the phosphorus sources used (for
example,
mesoporous 
TiPO 
prepared 
from 
TiCl4/H3PO4,
Ti(OR)4/PCl3, TiCl4/OP(OR)3 and TiCl4/P(OR)3 pairs all show very
similar P electron bonding energies of 140.00.1eV).The N2 sorption
curves of those materials are typical type IV isotherms with either H1or
H2 hysteresis loops depending on the mesoporous channel structures
(tubular or caged). The pore sizes are normally greater than 4 nm and
have narrow size distributions with FWHM values less than 2 nm.
The aforementioned phosphates have at least five distinct merits
(see details in Supplementary Information) from the structural
point of view. First, they have homogeneous and tunable
compositions.

surfactants,or by using different surfactants,which is in agreement with previous
synthesis pathways2,3,6,7.Here we detail only syntheses using triblock copolymers,but
cationic surfactants such as alkyltrimethylammonium bromide can also be used as
templates to prepare highly ordered mesoporous minerals with much smaller pore sizes
and thinner pore walls.b,Syntheses of various mesoporous metal phosphates through
fundamental routes A to E and their derivatives.Route C is not effective in our synthetic
system,probably because of less-controlled inorganic precipitation,but will work with the
addition of some strong acid,either metal chloride or phosphorus chloride (namely routes
H and K).Route E is suited for the preparation of metal oxides or mixed metal oxides
composites.Routes I and J derive from route A + B and route B + D,respectively.

microscopy/energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (SEM-EDX)
indicate that the different elements are distributed uniformly within
each inorganic framework. The metal/phosphorus ratios of the
samples can be easily tuned by changing the initial composition of
the mother liquor. Normally the prepared materials have a
metal/phosphorus ratio of about 1, as determined by EDX
measurements (see Supplementary Information). Second, highly
ordered periodicity and different symmetry mesostructures are
accessible. Examples are two-dimensional (2D) hexagonal, space
group p6m (such as AlPO, TiPO, NbPO, ZrPO, CePO), 3D body-
centred cubic, Im3m (such as TiPO, NbPO, ZrPO ), 3D hexagonal,
P63/mmc(such as AlPO,TiPO,NbPO ),3D bicontinuous cubic,Ia3d
(such as TiPO) and lamellar, L (such as AlPO, TiPO). It is worth
mentioning here that Im3m and P63/mmc space symmetries are
rarely reported for non-siliceous mesoporous materials and that the
Ia3d space group is the first reported non-siliceous inorganic
mesostructure templated by triblock copolymers.Third,we observe
large adjustable pore sizes when the structure-directing agents are
triblock copolymers whose average relative molecular mass, Mav,
values are above 5,000: for example 813 nm for AlPO; 511 nm
for TiPO; 47 nm for ZrPO and NbPO.Cationic surfactants,such
as alkyltrimethylammonium bromide, can also be used as the

structure-directing agents to produce highly ordered small-pore
mesoporous metal phosphates. To the best of our knowledge,
large-pore mesoporous metal phosphates have not been reported
previously because triblock copolymers have rarely been used in
the syntheses of metal phosphates, whereas ionic surfactants or
amines (smaller molecular size) have been commonly
used11,16,1828. Fourth, XRD curves and N2 sorption data measured
for the samples calcined at different temperatures reveal that these
metal phosphates have remarkable thermal stabilities that greatly
add to their possible uses. This thermal stability has not been
previously achieved for non-siliceous mesoporous compounds:
for example,
the mesostructures are maintained during
calcination to at least 800 C in air for AlPO and ZrPO, 700 C for
NbPO and TiPO, and 400 C for CePO. We associate this with the
new concept of using non-aqueous acidbase pairs for choosing
inorganic species that will fully interact under the self-adjusted
conditions, giving much thicker  inorganic walls (generally above
3 nm) that are homogeneous and more robust. Fifth, various
morphologies,
such as films,
monoliths,
fibres,
macro-
mesoporous hybrid materials, patterned mesoporous materials
and mesoporous tissues (Fig. 4) can be selectively generated in
high yields.We believe that this is the first report of the coordinated
synthesis and processing of mesostructured metal phosphates into
a variety of macroscale morphologies.
Mesoporous or mesostructured phosphates such as REPO
(RE = La, Sm and so on), silicoaluminophosphate (SAPO), MPO and
metal-doped silicoaluminophosphate (MSAPO) (M =V,W,Sn,In,Ca,
Mn,Fe,Co,Ni and so on) can also be prepared using the acidbase pairs
strategy. The concept has been further extended (see details in
Supplementary Information) and also proves effective for the
preparation of ordered mixed metal phosphates such as TixZr1xPO and
LiTi2(PO4)3; for highly ordered mesoporous or mesostructured metal
oxides such as TiO2 (ref. 29),Al2O3, ZrO2, Nb2O5, SnO2,VOx and WO3,
via the combinations of anhydrous metal chlorides (MCln) and the
corresponding metal alkoxides (M(OR)n),namely route E; for ordered
mesoporous mixed metal oxides such as ZrW2O8, SnxTi1xO2 and
CexTi1xO2, via proper combinations of metal chlorides (MClm and
MCln) and metal alkoxides (M(OR)m and M(OR)n); and for
mesoporous metal borates and ceramics, such as AlBO, TiBO and
SixAlyPzBwOv,by means of multiple acidbase pairs.
These ordered, large-pore, stable mesoporous minerals have
properties ofinterest for numerous potentially valuable applications.In
situ Fourier transform infrared spectra (pyridine adsorption) clearly
show that mesoporous NbPO,TiPO,ZrPO,AlBO and SAPO are strong
solid acids even when the temperature is raised to 300C.The bandgaps
calculated from ultravioletvisible spectra are 3.2 and 3.5 eV for TiPO
and NbPO,respectively,suggesting that those two types of mesoporous
metal phosphates may be used as wide-bandgap photocatalysts when
properly doped or functionalized.
Measurements show that
mesoporous TiPO, ZrPO, NbPO and LiTi2(PO4)3 (LTP) have different
conductivities (107 < δ < 104 S cm1) at room temperature, probably
because ofthe mobile protons and/or lithium ions.Mesoporous LTP has
relatively good conductivity (7.9 × 105 S cm1) and offers the
possibility of delivering ions to large accessible pores, which would be
useful for the creation of gas sensors, solid electrolytes and other ion
transport microdevices.
In this work, we predictively extend the mesoporous materials
family by introducing a new concept acid base pairs. This concept
takes a different perspective to address the influence of
inorganicinorganic interplay on the synthesis of mesoporous
materials, and we successfully obtained many composites, including
metal phosphates, metal borates, metal oxides and mixed metal
oxides. These new mesoporous materials are extraordinary in that
they exhibit large channels of cages, very high thermal stabilities,
tunable and homogeneous compositions, various morphologies and
abundant properties useful for potential applications.

METHODS
PREPARATION
Generally,we started by dissolving 0.61.5 g of triblock poly(ethylene oxide)-b-poly(propylene oxide)-b-
poly(ethylene oxide) copolymers (EO20PO70EO20,Pluronic P123;EO106PO70EO106,Pluronic F127;
EO132PO50EO132,Pluronic F108;EO123PO47EO123,Pluronic F98;EO39BO47EO39,B50-6600 and so on) in
1050 g of ethanol.Then metal and phosphorus sources (0.01 mol) were added as a batch.The solutions were
stirred for at least 0.5 h and underwent further treatment to reach the final morphologies.Calcination of
those samples was done in an oven at 350900 C in air for 5 h.
MESOSTRUCTURES
In typical syntheses,the hexagonal,cubic (Ia3d) and lamellar TiPO mesostructures were prepared by 
tuning the P123/(Ti + P) molar ratios to 1.21.6 × 102,1.82.1 × 102 and above 2.3 × 102,respectively.
Cubic (Im3m) mesoporous TiPO products were templated by triblock copolymer F108.The mother liquor
for hexagonal mesoporous AlPO was typically prepared from route D,namely by dissolving 0.91.1 g of
P123,0.667 g of AlCl3 and 0.576 g of H3PO4 (85 wt%) in 30 ml of ethanol.Cubic mesoporous ZrPO was 
prepared from Zr(OC3H7)4,PCl3 and triblock copolymer F108 (route A) in a mass ratio of Zr(OC3H7)4
(70%):PCl3:F108 = 2.33:0.69:0.91.4.Cubic mesoporous NbPO and hexagonal mesoporous CePO were all
prepared by using phosphate ester OP(OCH3)3 (route B).
MORPHOLOGIES
The various morphologies were constructed as follows.The mesoporous AlPO films were deposited on 
silicon wafers by dip-coating (coating rate of 0.3 cm s1).The mesostructured TiPO monoliths were prepared
by a solvent evaporation method.In a typical synthesis,0.8 g of P123,0.69 g of PCl3 and 1.42 g of Ti(OC3H7)4
were mixed with 10 g of ethanol and stirred for at least 3 h.Then the mother liquor was transferred to a plastic
container (such as a test tube).The solvent was controllably evaporated in air for 15 days to obtain a 
transparent brown monolith.The mesoporous ZrPO fibres were prepared by drawing.The mother liquor
was made highly viscous by heat treatment and then the fibres were drawn out with a glass rod.In the 
preparation of patterned mesoporous metal phosphates,the surfactant-containing sols were made to 
penetrate into the interspace of either pre-patterned latex spheres (commercial polystyrene spheres with radii
of 300 nm) or hexagonal etched silicone moulds by capillary forces and then gelled.Mesoporous spine-like
and rod-like TiPO tissueswere templated by palm leaves and bamboo,respectively.The dry plant tissues
were sonicated within a calculated amount of TiPO sol for 20 min,followed by solvent evaporation at 
elevated temperatures.Finally the composites were calcined at 650 C in air for 10 h.
CHARACTERIZATION
XRD patterns were recorded with a Bruker D4 diffractometer with Cu Kα radiation;TEM experiments were
made on a JEOL 2011 microscope operated at 200 kV;N2 sorption measurements were made at 77 K using a
Micromeritics Tri-star 3000 analyser;solid-state NMR data were collected on a DSX300 spectrometer.
Spectra of 31P MAS NMR were measured at 121.50 MHz and 31P chemical shifts are quoted with respect to
external 85% H3PO4.Spectra of 27Al MAS NMR were acquired at 78.20 MHz and the positions of 27Al 
resonances are given in p.p.m.relative to external Al(H2O)6
3+.The XPS spectra were collected on an improved
PHI 5000C ESCA system using Al Kα radiation (hν = 1,486.6 eV).The spectrometer was operated at 14 kV
and 250W with a pass energy of 46.95 eV.The spectrometer was calibrated using Cu 2p3/2 at a binding

First, you need to sequentially extract any quotes in the literature that are most relevant to each question, and print them in numbered order, separated by newlines. Quotes should be relatively brief. Do not attempt to summarize or answer questions at this stage, but simply repeat exactly what the corresponding part of the literature says.

Please enclose the full list of quotes in <quotes></quotes> XML tags. If there are no relevant quotes, write "No relevant quotes" instead.

Then, answer the question, starting with "Answer:".  Do not include or reference quoted content verbatim in the answer. Don't say "According to Quote [1]" when answering. Do not write reference number of quotes after answer. Put your answer to the user inside <EnglishVersionAnswer></EnglishVersionAnswer> XML tags. Output formatted text, with line breaks for each question.Separate quotes and answers with a blank line. Provide the answers to all questions in English. After completing the English answers, translate all those answers into Chinese and provide the Chinese version inside <ChineseVersionAnswer></ChineseVersionAnswer> XML tags.

Thus, the format of your overall response should look like what's shown between the <example></example> tags.  Make sure to follow the formatting and spacing exactly.
