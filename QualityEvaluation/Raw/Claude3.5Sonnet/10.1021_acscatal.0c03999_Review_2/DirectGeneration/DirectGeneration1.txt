Chromium-based catalytic systems have garnered significant attention in recent years due to their potential for enhancing CO2 activation and oxidizing ability. However, these systems face several challenges, including limited catalytic activity, poor selectivity, and rapid deactivation. To address these issues, researchers have employed various strategies, such as optimizing catalyst composition, engineering surface structures, and controlling reaction conditions. One particularly promising approach involves the use of promoters, which are additives that can significantly improve the performance and selectivity of chromium-based catalysts. These promoters work by modifying the electronic properties of the catalyst, creating synergistic effects, or altering the surface chemistry to facilitate CO2 adsorption and activation. As a result, the incorporation of carefully selected promoters can lead to enhanced catalytic activity, improved product yields, and increased stability of the catalytic system. Ongoing research in this field aims to identify novel promoters and elucidate their precise mechanisms of action, ultimately paving the way for more efficient and sustainable CO2 utilization processes in industrial applications.
