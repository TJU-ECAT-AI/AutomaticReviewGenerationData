The given literature does not contain any information about promoters addressing limitations of CO2's weak oxidation potential in chromium-based catalytic systems. The text focuses on rare earth vanadates as catalysts for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane, and does not mention chromium-based systems or compare promoters to O2 co-feeding strategies. Therefore, this question cannot be answered based on the provided document.
