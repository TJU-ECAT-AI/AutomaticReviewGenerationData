If, upon your assessment, you find that the answers do not contain information that is relevant to the questions asked, stop your review process immediately and respond with a single sentence: "※※※※※※※The provided answers are not relevant to the questions.※※※※※※※". Do not provide any additional explanation or background information, only this sentence should be given as a response in case of irrelevant answers.

If, however, the answers are relevant to the questions asked, proceed to compile answers for each question according to the instructions below. Ensure to aggregate all the relevant answers from the multiple answer results provided in the document, and organize them sequentially by their order number, compiling the corresponding quotes, English answers, and Chinese answers for each question.

If the provided answers' quotes are not differentiated by question, ensure to break them down and assign the quotes to each respective question, outputting them separately within each question's section.

To provide a comprehensive review, differentiate the responses into quotes, English answers, and Chinese answers for each question based on the details given in the 'Answer' XML tags. Structure your review using the XML format showcased below if the answers are relevant to the questions asked:

<EnglishVersionAnswer>

The given literature does not contain any information about promoters addressing limitations of CO2's weak oxidation potential and inertness in chromium-based catalytic systems, or their advantages over strategies like O2 co-feeding. The document appears to focus on nickel-based catalysts supported on nanocrystalline MgO for the reverse water gas shift reaction, and does not discuss chromium-based systems or promoters in the context described in the question. Therefore, this question cannot be answered based on the provided literature.

<ChineseVersionAnswer>

所提供的文献中没有关于促进剂如何解决铬基催化系统中CO2弱氧化能力和惰性的限制，也没有提到它们相对于O2共进料等策略在增强CO2活化、改善氧化能力以及实现选择性和稳定催化性能方面的具体优势。该文件似乎主要讨论了以纳米晶MgO为载体的镍基催化剂在逆水煤气变换反应中的应用，并未涉及问题中描述的铬基系统或促进剂。因此，基于提供的文献无法回答这个问题。

The provided literature does not contain any information about promoters addressing limitations of CO2's weak oxidation potential and inertness in chromium-based catalytic systems, or their advantages over O2 co-feeding. The text appears to be a title and author information for a manuscript about the reverse water gas shift reaction and CO2 mitigation using nanocrystalline MgO as a support for nickel-based catalysts. It does not provide details about catalytic systems, promoters, or specific strategies for CO2 activation.

The given literature does not contain any information about promoters addressing limitations of CO2's weak oxidation potential and inertness in chromium-based catalytic systems, nor does it discuss O2 co-feeding or compare strategies for enhancing CO2 activation. The document appears to be focused on using nanocrystalline MgO as a support for nickel-based catalysts in the reverse water gas shift reaction, which is a different topic from what is asked in the question. Therefore, this question cannot be answered based on the provided literature.
