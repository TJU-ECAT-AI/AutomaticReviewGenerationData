<EnglishVersionAnswer>

The given literature does not contain any information about promoters addressing limitations of CO2's weak oxidation potential and inertness in chromium-based catalytic systems, nor does it discuss O2 co-feeding or compare strategies for enhancing CO2 activation. The document appears to be focused on using nanocrystalline MgO as a support for nickel-based catalysts in the reverse water gas shift reaction, which is a different topic from what is asked in the question. Therefore, this question cannot be answered based on the provided literature.

所提供的文献中没有包含任何关于促进剂如何解决铬基催化体系中CO2氧化能力弱和惰性的局限性的信息，也没有讨论O2共进料或比较增强CO2活化的策略。这份文献似乎主要关注使用纳米晶MgO作为镍基催化剂的载体用于逆水气变换反应，这与问题所询问的内容是不同的主题。因此，基于所提供的文献无法回答这个问题。
