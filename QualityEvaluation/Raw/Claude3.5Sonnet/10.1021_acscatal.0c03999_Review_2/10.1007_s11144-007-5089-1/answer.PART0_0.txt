[1] "The DRS results obtained during the regeneration of the reduced CrOx/SiO2 catalyst show that CO2 is a very weak oxidant and that the efficiency of reoxidation by CO2 is much lower than that by oxygen."

[2] "According to this mechanism, hydrogen formed in the dehydrogenation of propane reduces Cr3+ to Cr2+ species (1), which in the next step are reoxidized by CO2 (2)."

[3] "On the surface of silica, a deep reduction of chromium species to Cr2+ is promoted especially at low Cr content, where the migration of Cr3+ species to form the stable Cr2O3 clusters is slow and further reduction of Cr3+ to Cr2+ species can continue."

The literature does not directly address promoters or compare CO2 activation strategies to O2 co-feeding for chromium-based catalysts. However, it does provide some relevant insights:

The document indicates that CO2 is a weak oxidant compared to oxygen for reoxidizing chromium species. It suggests a redox cycle mechanism where hydrogen from propane dehydrogenation reduces Cr3+ to Cr2+, which is then reoxidized by CO2. This cycle allows CO2 to indirectly participate in the reaction despite its weak oxidizing ability.

The paper notes that low chromium content on silica supports promotes deeper reduction to Cr2+, which may enhance this redox cycle. This suggests that controlling chromium loading could be one strategy to improve CO2 activation without promoters.

However, the literature does not discuss specific promoters or compare different CO2 activation approaches. More research would be needed to fully answer the question about promoter advantages over alternative strategies like O2 co-feeding for enhancing CO2 activation and achieving selective, stable catalytic performance in chromium-based systems.

该文献并未直接讨论促进剂或比较铬基催化剂的CO2活化策略与O2共进料。但是，它确实提供了一些相关的见解：

文件指出，与氧气相比，CO2是一种较弱的氧化剂，用于重新氧化铬物种。它提出了一种氧化还原循环机制，其中来自丙烷脱氢的氢还原Cr3+到Cr2+，然后被CO2重新氧化。这个循环允许CO2间接参与反应，尽管它的氧化能力较弱。

论文指出，在二氧化硅载体上的低铬含量促进了更深层次的还原到Cr2+，这可能会增强这种氧化还原循环。这表明控制铬负载可能是一种在不使用促进剂的情况下改善CO2活化的策略。

然而，该文献并未讨论具体的促进剂或比较不同的CO2活化方法。需要进行更多研究才能全面回答关于促进剂相对于其他策略（如O2共进料）在增强CO2活化和实现选择性、稳定的催化性能方面的优势问题。
