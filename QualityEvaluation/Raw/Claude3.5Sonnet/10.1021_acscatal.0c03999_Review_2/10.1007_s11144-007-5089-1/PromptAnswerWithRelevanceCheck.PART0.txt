[1] "The DRS results obtained during the regeneration of the reduced CrOx/SiO2 catalyst show that CO2 is a very weak oxidant and that the efficiency of reoxidation by CO2 is much lower than that by oxygen."

[2] "According to this mechanism, hydrogen formed in the dehydrogenation of propane reduces Cr3+ to Cr2+ species (1), which in the next step are reoxidized by CO2 (2)."

[3] "On the surface of silica, a deep reduction of chromium species to Cr2+ is promoted especially at low Cr content, where the migration of Cr3+ species to form the stable Cr2O3 clusters is slow and further reduction of Cr3+ to Cr2+ species can continue."

The literature does not directly address promoters or compare CO2 activation strategies to O2 co-feeding for chromium-based catalysts. However, it does provide some relevant insights:

The document indicates that CO2 is a weak oxidant compared to oxygen for reoxidizing chromium species. It suggests a redox cycle mechanism where hydrogen from propane dehydrogenation reduces Cr3+ to Cr2+, which is then reoxidized by CO2. This cycle allows CO2 to indirectly participate in the reaction despite its weak oxidizing ability.

The paper notes that low chromium content on silica supports promotes deeper reduction to Cr2+, which may enhance this redox cycle. This suggests that controlling chromium loading could be one strategy to improve CO2 activation without promoters.

However, the literature does not discuss specific promoters or compare different CO2 activation approaches. More research would be needed to fully answer the question about promoter advantages over alternative strategies like O2 co-feeding for enhancing CO2 activation and achieving selective, stable catalytic performance in chromium-based systems.

该文献并未直接讨论促进剂或比较铬基催化剂的CO2活化策略与O2共进料。但是，它确实提供了一些相关的见解：

文件指出，与氧气相比，CO2是一种较弱的氧化剂，用于重新氧化铬物种。它提出了一种氧化还原循环机制，其中来自丙烷脱氢的氢还原Cr3+到Cr2+，然后被CO2重新氧化。这个循环允许CO2间接参与反应，尽管它的氧化能力较弱。

论文指出，在二氧化硅载体上的低铬含量促进了更深层次的还原到Cr2+，这可能会增强这种氧化还原循环。这表明控制铬负载可能是一种在不使用促进剂的情况下改善CO2活化的策略。

然而，该文献并未讨论具体的促进剂或比较不同的CO2活化方法。需要进行更多研究才能全面回答关于促进剂相对于其他策略（如O2共进料）在增强CO2活化和实现选择性、稳定的催化性能方面的优势问题。

The literature does not directly address the use of promoters to enhance CO2 activation in chromium-based catalytic systems. However, it does discuss some mechanisms by which CO2 can be activated despite its weak oxidizing ability:

1. The reverse water-gas shift (RWGS) reaction can proceed via a redox cycle on chromium catalysts. In this cycle, hydrogen from propane dehydrogenation reduces Cr3+ to Cr2+, which is then reoxidized by CO2. This allows CO2 to be activated indirectly.

2. Low chromium content on silica supports promotes deeper reduction to Cr2+ species, which are more easily reoxidized by CO2 than Cr3+. This enhances CO2 activation compared to higher chromium loadings.

3. While not explicitly stated, the bi-functional nature of the CrOx/SiO2 catalyst (active for both dehydrogenation and RWGS) likely contributes to improved performance with CO2 compared to inert atmospheres.

The document does not compare these strategies to O2 co-feeding or discuss other promoters. More research would be needed to fully address the advantages over alternative approaches in terms of selectivity and stability.

该文献并未直接讨论使用促进剂来增强铬基催化系统中CO2活化的问题。然而，它确实讨论了一些CO2可以被活化的机制，尽管其氧化能力较弱：

1. 在铬催化剂上，逆水煤气变换(RWGS)反应可以通过氧化还原循环进行。在这个循环中，丙烷脱氢产生的氢气将Cr3+还原为Cr2+，然后Cr2+被CO2重新氧化。这允许CO2被间接活化。

2. 在二氧化硅载体上低含量的铬促进了更深层次的还原，生成Cr2+物种，这些物种比Cr3+更容易被CO2重新氧化。与高铬负载相比，这增强了CO2的活化。

3. 虽然没有明确说明，但CrOx/SiO2催化剂的双功能性质（对脱氢和RWGS都有活性）可能有助于在CO2存在下提高性能，相比于惰性气氛。

该文档没有将这些策略与O2共进料进行比较，也没有讨论其他促进剂。需要进行更多研究才能全面解答在选择性和稳定性方面相对于其他替代方法的优势。

The literature does not directly address promoters or compare CO2 activation strategies to O2 co-feeding for chromium-based catalysts. However, it does discuss some aspects of CO2 activation and oxidation in these systems:

The document indicates that CO2 is a weak oxidant compared to oxygen for reoxidizing reduced chromium species. To address this limitation, the literature suggests a redox cycle mechanism where hydrogen from propane dehydrogenation first reduces Cr3+ to Cr2+, which can then be more easily reoxidized by CO2. 

This redox cycle appears to be more effective on silica supports with low chromium content, where deeper reduction to Cr2+ is promoted due to slower formation of stable Cr2O3 clusters. The redox cycle allows for continuous reduction and reoxidation of chromium species, potentially improving CO2 activation and catalytic performance.

While not explicitly comparing to O2 co-feeding, this CO2-based redox mechanism may offer advantages in terms of selectivity by avoiding over-oxidation. However, the document does not provide enough information to fully assess the relative merits of this approach versus other strategies for enhancing CO2 utilization in chromium catalysts.

该文献没有直接讨论促进剂或比较CO2活化策略与O2共进料在铬基催化剂中的应用。但是，它确实讨论了这些系统中CO2活化和氧化的一些方面：

文献指出，与氧气相比，CO2是一种较弱的氧化剂，难以重新氧化还原态的铬物种。为了解决这一限制，文献提出了一种氧化还原循环机制，即首先由丙烷脱氢产生的氢将Cr3+还原为Cr2+，然后Cr2+可以更容易地被CO2重新氧化。

这种氧化还原循环在低铬含量的二氧化硅载体上似乎更有效，因为在这种情况下，由于稳定的Cr2O3簇形成较慢，更容易发生深度还原至Cr2+。这种氧化还原循环允许铬物种持续还原和再氧化，可能会改善CO2的活化和催化性能。

虽然没有明确与O2共进料进行比较，但这种基于CO2的氧化还原机制可能在选择性方面具有优势，因为它可以避免过度氧化。然而，该文献并未提供足够的信息来全面评估这种方法相对于其他提高铬催化剂CO2利用率策略的相对优势。

The literature does not directly address promoters or compare them to O2 co-feeding for enhancing CO2 activation in chromium-based catalytic systems. However, it does discuss some strategies to address CO2's weak oxidation potential:

1. Using supports like silica that promote deep reduction of chromium to Cr2+, especially at low chromium loadings. This allows CO2 to more easily reoxidize the chromium.

2. Leveraging the bi-functional nature of chromium catalysts to enable a redox cycle. Hydrogen produced from dehydrogenation reduces Cr3+ to Cr2+, which can then be reoxidized by CO2.

3. Employing catalysts with low chromium content, where chromium species are more dispersed and less likely to form stable Cr2O3 clusters resistant to further reduction/oxidation.

These strategies aim to improve CO2 activation and oxidizing ability compared to direct oxidation of Cr3+ to Cr6+ by CO2, which was found to be ineffective. However, the document does not provide information on how these approaches compare to O2 co-feeding in terms of selectivity and stability.

该文献并未直接讨论促进剂或将其与O2共馈相比较以增强铬基催化体系中的CO2活化。然而，它确实讨论了一些应对CO2弱氧化能力的策略：

1. 使用如二氧化硅等支撑剂，特别是在铬含量低时，促进铬深度还原为Cr2+。这使得CO2更容易重新氧化铬。

2. 利用铬催化剂的双功能性来实现氧化还原循环。脱氢产生的氢气将Cr3+还原为Cr2+，然后可被CO2重新氧化。

3. 采用低铬含量的催化剂，其中铬物种更分散，不太可能形成稳定的Cr2O3团簇，这些团簇会抵抗进一步的还原/氧化。

这些策略旨在改善CO2的活化和氧化能力，相比于CO2直接将Cr3+氧化为Cr6+（被发现是无效的）。然而，该文档并未提供关于这些方法在选择性和稳定性方面如何与O2共馈相比较的信息。

1. The reverse water-gas shift (RWGS) reaction can proceed via a redox cycle on chromium catalysts.

This allows CO2 to be activated and utilized without requiring it to directly oxidize Cr3+ to higher oxidation states.

2. Low chromium content on silica supports promotes deeper reduction to Cr2+ species, which can then be more easily reoxidized by CO2. This is because low Cr content prevents formation of stable Cr2O3 clusters that are resistant to further reduction.

3. While not explicitly stated, the bi-functional nature of the CrOx/SiO2 catalyst (active for both dehydrogenation and RWGS) likely contributes to its ability to utilize CO2 effectively despite CO2's weak oxidizing power.

该文献并未直接讨论使用助剂来增强铬基催化系统中CO2的活化。然而，它讨论了一些机制，通过这些机制，尽管CO2氧化能力较弱，但仍可在这些系统中被活化和利用：

1. 逆水气变换（RWGS）反应可以通过铬催化剂上的氧化还原循环进行。在这个循环中，来自丙烷脱氢的氢气将Cr3+还原为Cr2+，然后Cr2+被CO2重新氧化。这使得CO2可以被活化和利用，而不需要直接将Cr3+氧化到更高的氧化态。

2. 在二氧化硅载体上的低铬含量促进了更深层次的还原，形成Cr2+物种，这些物种随后可以更容易被CO2重新氧化。这是因为低铬含量防止了形成稳定的Cr2O3团簇，这些团簇会抵抗进一步的还原。

3. 虽然没有明确说明，但CrOx/SiO2催化剂的双功能性质（对脱氢和RWGS反应都有活性）可能有助于其有效利用CO2，尽管CO2的氧化能力较弱。

该文献没有将这些策略与O2共进料进行比较，也没有讨论具体的助剂。需要进行更多研究才能完全回答关于助剂的问题，并比较增强这些系统中CO2活化的不同方法。
