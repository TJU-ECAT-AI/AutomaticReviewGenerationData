[1] "The DRS results obtained during the regeneration of the reduced CrOx/SiO2 catalyst show that CO2 is a very weak oxidant and that the efficiency of reoxidation by CO2 is much lower than that by oxygen."

[2] "Recently, Ohishi et al. [12] have proposed that over the CrOx/MCM-41 catalyst, the RWGS reaction can proceed via a redox cycle."

[3] "According to this mechanism, hydrogen formed in the dehydrogenation of propane reduces Cr3+ to Cr2+ species (1), which in the next step are reoxidized by CO2 (2)."

[4] "On the surface of silica, a deep reduction of chromium species to Cr2+ is promoted especially at low Cr content, where the migration of Cr3+ species to form the stable Cr2O3 clusters is slow and further reduction of Cr3+ to Cr2+ species can continue."

The literature does not directly address the use of promoters to enhance CO2 activation in chromium-based catalytic systems. However, it does discuss some mechanisms by which CO2 can be activated despite its weak oxidizing ability:

1. The reverse water-gas shift (RWGS) reaction can proceed via a redox cycle on chromium catalysts. In this cycle, hydrogen from propane dehydrogenation reduces Cr3+ to Cr2+, which is then reoxidized by CO2. This allows CO2 to be activated indirectly.

2. Low chromium content on silica supports promotes deeper reduction to Cr2+ species, which are more easily reoxidized by CO2 than Cr3+. This enhances CO2 activation compared to higher chromium loadings.

3. While not explicitly stated, the bi-functional nature of the CrOx/SiO2 catalyst (active for both dehydrogenation and RWGS) likely contributes to improved performance with CO2 compared to inert atmospheres.

The document does not compare these strategies to O2 co-feeding or discuss other promoters. More research would be needed to fully address the advantages over alternative approaches in terms of selectivity and stability.

该文献并未直接讨论使用促进剂来增强铬基催化系统中CO2活化的问题。然而，它确实讨论了一些CO2可以被活化的机制，尽管其氧化能力较弱：

1. 在铬催化剂上，逆水煤气变换(RWGS)反应可以通过氧化还原循环进行。在这个循环中，丙烷脱氢产生的氢气将Cr3+还原为Cr2+，然后Cr2+被CO2重新氧化。这允许CO2被间接活化。

2. 在二氧化硅载体上低含量的铬促进了更深层次的还原，生成Cr2+物种，这些物种比Cr3+更容易被CO2重新氧化。与高铬负载相比，这增强了CO2的活化。

3. 虽然没有明确说明，但CrOx/SiO2催化剂的双功能性质（对脱氢和RWGS都有活性）可能有助于在CO2存在下提高性能，相比于惰性气氛。

该文档没有将这些策略与O2共进料进行比较，也没有讨论其他促进剂。需要进行更多研究才能全面解答在选择性和稳定性方面相对于其他替代方法的优势。
