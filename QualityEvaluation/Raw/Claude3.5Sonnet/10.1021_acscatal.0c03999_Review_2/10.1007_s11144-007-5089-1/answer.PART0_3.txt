[1] "The DRS results obtained during the regeneration of the reduced CrOx/SiO2 catalyst show that CO2 is a very weak oxidant and that the efficiency of reoxidation by CO2 is much lower than that by oxygen."

[2] "Recently, Ohishi et al. [12] have proposed that over the CrOx/MCM-41 catalyst, the RWGS reaction can proceed via a redox cycle."

[3] "According to this mechanism, hydrogen formed in the dehydrogenation of propane reduces Cr3+ to Cr2+ species (1), which in the next step are reoxidized by CO2 (2)."

[4] "On the surface of silica, a deep reduction of chromium species to Cr2+ is promoted especially at low Cr content, where the migration of Cr3+ species to form the stable Cr2O3 clusters is slow and further reduction of Cr3+ to Cr2+ species can continue."

The literature does not directly address promoters or compare them to O2 co-feeding for enhancing CO2 activation in chromium-based catalytic systems. However, it does discuss some strategies to address CO2's weak oxidation potential:

1. Using supports like silica that promote deep reduction of chromium to Cr2+, especially at low chromium loadings. This allows CO2 to more easily reoxidize the chromium.

2. Leveraging the bi-functional nature of chromium catalysts to enable a redox cycle. Hydrogen produced from dehydrogenation reduces Cr3+ to Cr2+, which can then be reoxidized by CO2.

3. Employing catalysts with low chromium content, where chromium species are more dispersed and less likely to form stable Cr2O3 clusters resistant to further reduction/oxidation.

These strategies aim to improve CO2 activation and oxidizing ability compared to direct oxidation of Cr3+ to Cr6+ by CO2, which was found to be ineffective. However, the document does not provide information on how these approaches compare to O2 co-feeding in terms of selectivity and stability.

该文献并未直接讨论促进剂或将其与O2共馈相比较以增强铬基催化体系中的CO2活化。然而，它确实讨论了一些应对CO2弱氧化能力的策略：

1. 使用如二氧化硅等支撑剂，特别是在铬含量低时，促进铬深度还原为Cr2+。这使得CO2更容易重新氧化铬。

2. 利用铬催化剂的双功能性来实现氧化还原循环。脱氢产生的氢气将Cr3+还原为Cr2+，然后可被CO2重新氧化。

3. 采用低铬含量的催化剂，其中铬物种更分散，不太可能形成稳定的Cr2O3团簇，这些团簇会抵抗进一步的还原/氧化。

这些策略旨在改善CO2的活化和氧化能力，相比于CO2直接将Cr3+氧化为Cr6+（被发现是无效的）。然而，该文档并未提供关于这些方法在选择性和稳定性方面如何与O2共馈相比较的信息。
