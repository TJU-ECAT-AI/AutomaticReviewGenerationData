[1] "The DRS results obtained during the regeneration of the reduced CrOx/SiO2 catalyst show that CO2 is a very weak oxidant and that the efficiency of reoxidation by CO2 is much lower than that by oxygen."

[2] "Recently, Ohishi et al. [12] have proposed that over the CrOx/MCM-41 catalyst, the RWGS reaction can proceed via a redox cycle."

[3] "According to this mechanism, hydrogen formed in the dehydrogenation of propane reduces Cr3+ to Cr2+ species (1), which in the next step are reoxidized by CO2 (2)."

[4] "On the surface of silica, a deep reduction of chromium species to Cr2+ is promoted especially at low Cr content, where the migration of Cr3+ species to form the stable Cr2O3 clusters is slow and further reduction of Cr3+ to Cr2+ species can continue."

The literature does not directly address promoters or compare CO2 activation strategies to O2 co-feeding for chromium-based catalysts. However, it does discuss some aspects of CO2 activation and oxidation in these systems:

The document indicates that CO2 is a weak oxidant compared to oxygen for reoxidizing reduced chromium species. To address this limitation, the literature suggests a redox cycle mechanism where hydrogen from propane dehydrogenation first reduces Cr3+ to Cr2+, which can then be more easily reoxidized by CO2. 

This redox cycle appears to be more effective on silica supports with low chromium content, where deeper reduction to Cr2+ is promoted due to slower formation of stable Cr2O3 clusters. The redox cycle allows for continuous reduction and reoxidation of chromium species, potentially improving CO2 activation and catalytic performance.

While not explicitly comparing to O2 co-feeding, this CO2-based redox mechanism may offer advantages in terms of selectivity by avoiding over-oxidation. However, the document does not provide enough information to fully assess the relative merits of this approach versus other strategies for enhancing CO2 utilization in chromium catalysts.

该文献没有直接讨论促进剂或比较CO2活化策略与O2共进料在铬基催化剂中的应用。但是，它确实讨论了这些系统中CO2活化和氧化的一些方面：

文献指出，与氧气相比，CO2是一种较弱的氧化剂，难以重新氧化还原态的铬物种。为了解决这一限制，文献提出了一种氧化还原循环机制，即首先由丙烷脱氢产生的氢将Cr3+还原为Cr2+，然后Cr2+可以更容易地被CO2重新氧化。

这种氧化还原循环在低铬含量的二氧化硅载体上似乎更有效，因为在这种情况下，由于稳定的Cr2O3簇形成较慢，更容易发生深度还原至Cr2+。这种氧化还原循环允许铬物种持续还原和再氧化，可能会改善CO2的活化和催化性能。

虽然没有明确与O2共进料进行比较，但这种基于CO2的氧化还原机制可能在选择性方面具有优势，因为它可以避免过度氧化。然而，该文献并未提供足够的信息来全面评估这种方法相对于其他提高铬催化剂CO2利用率策略的相对优势。
