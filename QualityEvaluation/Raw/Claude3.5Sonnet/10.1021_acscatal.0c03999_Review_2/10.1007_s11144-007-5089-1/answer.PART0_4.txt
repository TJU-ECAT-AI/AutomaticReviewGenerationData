[1] "The DRS results obtained during the regeneration of the reduced CrOx/SiO2 catalyst show that CO2 is a very weak oxidant and that the efficiency of reoxidation by CO2 is much lower than that by oxygen."

[2] "Recently, Ohishi et al. [12] have proposed that over the CrOx/MCM-41 catalyst, the RWGS reaction can proceed via a redox cycle."

[3] "According to this mechanism, hydrogen formed in the dehydrogenation of propane reduces Cr3+ to Cr2+ species (1), which in the next step are reoxidized by CO2 (2)."

[4] "On the surface of silica, a deep reduction of chromium species to Cr2+ is promoted especially at low Cr content, where the migration of Cr3+ species to form the stable Cr2O3 clusters is slow and further reduction of Cr3+ to Cr2+ species can continue."

The literature does not directly address the use of promoters to enhance CO2 activation in chromium-based catalytic systems. However, it discusses some mechanisms by which CO2 can be activated and utilized in these systems despite its weak oxidizing ability:

1. The reverse water-gas shift (RWGS) reaction can proceed via a redox cycle on chromium catalysts. In this cycle, hydrogen from propane dehydrogenation reduces Cr3+ to Cr2+, which is then reoxidized by CO2. This allows CO2 to be activated and utilized without requiring it to directly oxidize Cr3+ to higher oxidation states.

2. Low chromium content on silica supports promotes deeper reduction to Cr2+ species, which can then be more easily reoxidized by CO2. This is because low Cr content prevents formation of stable Cr2O3 clusters that are resistant to further reduction.

3. While not explicitly stated, the bi-functional nature of the CrOx/SiO2 catalyst (active for both dehydrogenation and RWGS) likely contributes to its ability to utilize CO2 effectively despite CO2's weak oxidizing power.

The literature does not compare these strategies to O2 co-feeding or discuss specific promoters. More research would be needed to fully answer the question about promoters and compare different approaches for enhancing CO2 activation in these systems.

该文献并未直接讨论使用助剂来增强铬基催化系统中CO2的活化。然而，它讨论了一些机制，通过这些机制，尽管CO2氧化能力较弱，但仍可在这些系统中被活化和利用：

1. 逆水气变换（RWGS）反应可以通过铬催化剂上的氧化还原循环进行。在这个循环中，来自丙烷脱氢的氢气将Cr3+还原为Cr2+，然后Cr2+被CO2重新氧化。这使得CO2可以被活化和利用，而不需要直接将Cr3+氧化到更高的氧化态。

2. 在二氧化硅载体上的低铬含量促进了更深层次的还原，形成Cr2+物种，这些物种随后可以更容易被CO2重新氧化。这是因为低铬含量防止了形成稳定的Cr2O3团簇，这些团簇会抵抗进一步的还原。

3. 虽然没有明确说明，但CrOx/SiO2催化剂的双功能性质（对脱氢和RWGS反应都有活性）可能有助于其有效利用CO2，尽管CO2的氧化能力较弱。

该文献没有将这些策略与O2共进料进行比较，也没有讨论具体的助剂。需要进行更多研究才能完全回答关于助剂的问题，并比较增强这些系统中CO2活化的不同方法。
