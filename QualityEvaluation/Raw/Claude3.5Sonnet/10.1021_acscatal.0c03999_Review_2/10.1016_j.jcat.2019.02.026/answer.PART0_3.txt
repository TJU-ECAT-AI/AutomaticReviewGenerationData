[1] "Recently, carbon dioxide (CO2), as a promising nonconventional oxidant for catalytic oxidative dehydrogenation of light alkanes to olefins, has drawn much attention. In comparison with molecular O2, the lower oxidizing activity of CO2 is shown to shift the ODH reaction toward more olefin production, which means that more reactive olefins are prevented for deep oxidation in the presence of CO2"

[2] "CO2 can also oxidize active sites and stabilize the catalyst by eliminating coke through the reverse Boudouard reaction"

[3] "The foremost effect of CO2 is inhibiting rather than eliminating coke. Moreover, a possible new coke formation route is proposed."

[4] "To open 4%CO2/2%H2/Ar gas and keep 50 ml/min total gas flowing for 60 min, no new peaks were observed (Fig. S5B). But when CO2 gas flow was closed down and H2 gas proportion turned up to 5%H2/Ar, new bands appear at 1395 and 1595 cm1 (assigned to the D-band and G-band of coke, respectively)"

The literature does not directly discuss promoters addressing CO2's limitations in chromium-based catalytic systems. However, it does highlight some advantages of using CO2 as an oxidant compared to O2:

1. CO2 has lower oxidizing activity than O2, which helps prevent deep oxidation of olefins and shifts selectivity towards desired olefin products.

2. CO2 can oxidize active sites and stabilize the catalyst by eliminating coke through the reverse Boudouard reaction. 

3. The main effect of CO2 is inhibiting coke formation rather than eliminating existing coke.

4. CO2 prevents reduction of active Cr3+ species to less active Cr2+ species, helping maintain catalyst activity.

5. The presence of CO2 inhibits coke formation by consuming hydrogen species that would otherwise lead to coke.

While these advantages are noted, the literature does not compare CO2 to O2 co-feeding or discuss specific promoters to enhance CO2 activation. More research would be needed to fully address the question's focus on promoters and comparisons to O2 co-feeding strategies.

该文献没有直接讨论促进剂如何解决铬基催化系统中CO2的局限性。但是,它确实强调了使用CO2作为氧化剂相比O2的一些优势:

1. CO2的氧化活性低于O2,这有助于防止烯烃的深度氧化,并将选择性转向所需的烯烃产物。

2. CO2可以通过逆布多瓦反应氧化活性位点并稳定催化剂,消除积碳。

3. CO2的主要作用是抑制积碳形成,而不是消除现有积碳。

4. CO2防止活性Cr3+物种还原为活性较低的Cr2+物种,有助于维持催化剂活性。

5. CO2的存在通过消耗会导致积碳的氢物种来抑制积碳的形成。

虽然注意到了这些优势,但文献并未将CO2与O2共进料进行比较,也没有讨论增强CO2活化的特定促进剂。需要进行更多研究才能充分解决该问题关于促进剂和与O2共进料策略比较的重点。
