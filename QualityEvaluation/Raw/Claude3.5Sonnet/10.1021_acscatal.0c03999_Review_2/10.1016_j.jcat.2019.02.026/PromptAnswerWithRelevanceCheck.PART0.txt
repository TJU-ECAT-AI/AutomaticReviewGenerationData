[1] "Recently, carbon dioxide (CO2), as a promising nonconventional oxidant for catalytic oxidative dehydrogenation of light alkanes to olefins, has drawn much attention. In comparison with molecular O2, the lower oxidizing activity of CO2 is shown to shift the ODH reaction toward more olefin production, which means that more reactive olefins are prevented for deep oxidation in the presence of CO2"

[2] "CO2 can also oxidize active sites and stabilize the catalyst by eliminating coke through the reverse Boudouard reaction"

[3] "The foremost effect of CO2 is inhibiting rather than eliminating coke. Moreover, a possible new coke formation route is proposed."

[4] "To open 4%CO2/2%H2/Ar gas and keep 50 ml/min total gas flowing for 60 min, no new peaks were observed (Fig. S5B). But when CO2 gas flow was closed down and H2 gas proportion turned up to 5%H2/Ar, new bands appear at 1395 and 1595 cm1 (assigned to the D-band and G-band of coke, respectively [4648]), and they become sharper with reaction time as shown in Fig. S5C."

The literature does not directly address promoters for enhancing CO2 activation in chromium-based catalytic systems. However, it does discuss some advantages of using CO2 as an oxidant compared to O2:

1. CO2 has lower oxidizing activity than O2, which shifts the reaction toward more olefin production by preventing deep oxidation of reactive olefins.

2. CO2 can oxidize active sites and stabilize the catalyst by eliminating coke through the reverse Boudouard reaction. 

3. The main effect of CO2 is inhibiting coke formation rather than eliminating existing coke.

4. In the presence of CO2, no coke formation was observed, but when CO2 flow was stopped and H2 increased, coke bands appeared in the Raman spectra.

These advantages suggest CO2 can provide more selective and stable catalytic performance compared to O2. However, the document does not discuss specific promoters or compare CO2 to O2 co-feeding strategies in detail. More research would be needed to fully answer the question about promoters enhancing CO2 activation and oxidizing ability in chromium-based systems.

文献并未直接讨论促进剂在增强铬基催化体系中CO2活化方面的作用。但是，它确实讨论了使用CO2作为氧化剂相比O2的一些优势：

1. CO2的氧化活性比O2低，这使反应向更多烯烃生成方向转移，防止了活性烯烃的深度氧化。

2. CO2可以通过逆布德瓦反应氧化活性位点并稳定催化剂，消除积碳。

3. CO2的主要作用是抑制积碳形成，而不是消除已存在的积碳。

4. 在CO2存在的情况下，没有观察到积碳形成，但当CO2流停止且H2增加时，拉曼光谱中出现了积碳带。

这些优势表明，与O2相比，CO2可以提供更具选择性和稳定性的催化性能。然而，该文档并未详细讨论具体的促进剂或将CO2与O2共同进料策略进行比较。需要进行更多研究才能全面回答关于促进剂增强铬基系统中CO2活化和氧化能力的问题。

3. CO2 inhibits coke formation rather than primarily eliminating existing coke.

4. CO2 prevents the over-reduction of active oxidative chromium species by consuming excess hydrogen.

These properties allow CO2 to act as a milder, more selective oxidant compared to O2, potentially improving catalyst stability and product selectivity. However, the document does not discuss specific promoters or compare CO2 to O2 co-feeding strategies in detail.

该文献并未直接讨论增强铬基催化剂中CO2活化的助剂。但是，它确实讨论了使用CO2作为氧化剂相比O2的一些优势：

1. CO2较低的氧化活性使反应向更多烯烃产物方向转移，防止了活性烯烃的深度氧化。

2. CO2可以通过逆布德瓦反应氧化活性位点并稳定催化剂，消除积碳。

3. CO2主要是抑制积碳形成，而不是消除已存在的积碳。

The literature does not directly discuss promoters addressing CO2's limitations in chromium-based catalytic systems. However, it does highlight some advantages of using CO2 as an oxidant compared to O2:

1. CO2 has lower oxidizing activity than O2, which helps prevent deep oxidation of olefins and shifts selectivity towards desired olefin products.

2. CO2 can oxidize active sites and stabilize the catalyst by eliminating coke through the reverse Boudouard reaction. 

3. The main effect of CO2 is inhibiting coke formation rather than eliminating existing coke.

4. CO2 prevents reduction of active Cr3+ species to less active Cr2+ species, helping maintain catalyst activity.

5. The presence of CO2 inhibits coke formation by consuming hydrogen species that would otherwise lead to coke.

While these advantages are noted, the literature does not compare CO2 to O2 co-feeding or discuss specific promoters to enhance CO2 activation. More research would be needed to fully address the question's focus on promoters and comparisons to O2 co-feeding strategies.

该文献没有直接讨论促进剂如何解决铬基催化系统中CO2的局限性。但是,它确实强调了使用CO2作为氧化剂相比O2的一些优势:

1. CO2的氧化活性低于O2,这有助于防止烯烃的深度氧化,并将选择性转向所需的烯烃产物。

2. CO2可以通过逆布多瓦反应氧化活性位点并稳定催化剂,消除积碳。

3. CO2的主要作用是抑制积碳形成,而不是消除现有积碳。

1. CO2的氧化活性比O2低，这有助于防止过度氧化所需的烯烃产物。
