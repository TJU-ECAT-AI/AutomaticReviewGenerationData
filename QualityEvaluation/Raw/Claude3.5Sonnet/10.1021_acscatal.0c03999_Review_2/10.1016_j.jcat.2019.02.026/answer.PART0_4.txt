[1] "Recently, carbon dioxide (CO2), as a promising nonconventional oxidant for catalytic oxidative dehydrogenation of light alkanes to olefins, has drawn much attention. In comparison with molecular O2, the lower oxidizing activity of CO2 is shown to shift the ODH reaction toward more olefin production, which means that more reactive olefins are prevented for deep oxidation in the presence of CO2"

[2] "CO2 consumes hydrogen species through the reverse water-gas shift (RWGS) reaction, which is beneficial for enhancing the equilibrium of light alkane conversion. CO2 can also oxidize active sites and stabilize the catalyst by eliminating coke through the reverse Boudouard reaction"

[3] "The foremost effect of CO2 is inhibiting rather than eliminating coke. Moreover, a possible new coke formation route is proposed."

The literature does not directly address promoters for enhancing CO2 activation in chromium-based catalysts. However, it does discuss some advantages of using CO2 as an oxidant compared to O2:

1. CO2 has lower oxidizing activity than O2, which helps prevent over-oxidation of desired olefin products. 

2. CO2 consumes hydrogen through the reverse water-gas shift reaction, which enhances alkane conversion equilibrium.

3. CO2 can oxidize active sites and help stabilize the catalyst by inhibiting coke formation.

4. The main effect of CO2 is inhibiting coke formation rather than eliminating existing coke.

While not discussing promoters specifically, the paper suggests CO2 itself acts as a mild oxidant that can enhance stability and selectivity compared to O2. However, the literature does not provide a comprehensive comparison to O2 co-feeding or discuss strategies to further improve CO2 activation.

该文献没有直接讨论用于增强铬基催化剂中CO2活化的助剂。但是，它确实讨论了使用CO2作为氧化剂相比O2的一些优势：

1. CO2的氧化活性比O2低，这有助于防止过度氧化所需的烯烃产物。

2. CO2通过反向水气变换反应消耗氢气，这增强了烷烃转化的平衡。

3. CO2可以氧化活性位点并通过抑制积碳形成来帮助稳定催化剂。

4. CO2的主要作用是抑制积碳形成，而不是消除现有的积碳。

虽然没有具体讨论助剂，但该论文表明CO2本身作为一种温和的氧化剂，可以提高稳定性和选择性，相比O2而言。然而，该文献并没有提供与O2共进料的全面比较，也没有讨论进一步改善CO2活化的策略。
