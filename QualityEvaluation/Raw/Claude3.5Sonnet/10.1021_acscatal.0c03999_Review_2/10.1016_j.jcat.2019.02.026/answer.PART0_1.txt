[1] "Recently, carbon dioxide (CO2), as a promising nonconventional oxidant for catalytic oxidative dehydrogenation of light alkanes to olefins, has drawn much attention. In comparison with molecular O2, the lower oxidizing activity of CO2 is shown to shift the ODH reaction toward more olefin production, which means that more reactive olefins are prevented for deep oxidation in the presence of CO2"

[2] "CO2 can also oxidize active sites and stabilize the catalyst by eliminating coke through the reverse Boudouard reaction"

[3] "The foremost effect of CO2 is inhibiting rather than eliminating coke. Moreover, a possible new coke formation route is proposed."

[4] "To open 4%CO2/2%H2/Ar gas and keep 50 ml/min total gas flowing for 60 min, no new peaks were observed (Fig. S5B). But when CO2 gas flow was closed down and H2 gas proportion turned up to 5%H2/Ar, new bands appear at 1395 and 1595 cm1 (assigned to the D-band and G-band of coke, respectively [4648]), and they become sharper with reaction time as shown in Fig. S5C."

The literature does not directly address promoters for enhancing CO2 activation in chromium-based catalytic systems. However, it does discuss some advantages of using CO2 as an oxidant compared to O2:

1. CO2 has lower oxidizing activity than O2, which shifts the reaction towards more olefin production by preventing deep oxidation of reactive olefins.

2. CO2 can oxidize active sites and stabilize the catalyst by eliminating coke through the reverse Boudouard reaction. 

3. The main effect of CO2 is inhibiting coke formation rather than eliminating existing coke.

4. The presence of CO2 prevents the formation of coke bands in Raman spectra, which appear when CO2 is removed and H2 concentration is increased.

However, the document does not discuss specific promoters or compare CO2 to O2 co-feeding in detail. More information would be needed to fully answer the question about promoters and their specific advantages over O2 co-feeding for CO2 activation and improving oxidizing ability.

这篇文献并没有直接讨论用于增强铬基催化系统中CO2活化的助剂。但是，它确实讨论了使用CO2作为氧化剂相比O2的一些优势：

1. CO2的氧化活性比O2低，这使反应向更多烯烃生产方向转移，通过防止活性烯烃深度氧化。

2. CO2可以通过逆布德瓦反应氧化活性位点并稳定催化剂，消除积碳。

3. CO2的主要作用是抑制积碳形成，而不是消除现有积碳。

4. CO2的存在可以防止拉曼光谱中积碳带的形成，这些积碳带在移除CO2并增加H2浓度时出现。

然而，该文档并未详细讨论具体的助剂或将CO2与O2共进料进行比较。需要更多信息才能完整回答关于助剂及其在CO2活化和提高氧化能力方面相对于O2共进料的具体优势的问题。
