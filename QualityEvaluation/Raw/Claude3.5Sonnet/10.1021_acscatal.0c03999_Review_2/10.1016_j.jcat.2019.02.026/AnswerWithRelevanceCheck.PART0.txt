          [1] "Recently, carbon dioxide (CO2), as a promising nonconventional oxidant for catalytic oxidative dehydrogenation of light alkanes to olefins, has drawn much attention. In comparison with molecular O2, the lower oxidizing activity of CO2 is shown to shift the ODH reaction toward more olefin production, which means that more reactive olefins are prevented for deep oxidation in the presence of CO2"

          [2] "CO2 can also oxidize active sites and stabilize the catalyst by eliminating coke through the reverse Boudouard reaction"

          [3] "The foremost effect of CO2 is inhibiting rather than eliminating coke. Moreover, a possible new coke formation route is proposed."

          [4] "To open 4%CO2/2%H2/Ar gas and keep 50 ml/min total gas flowing for 60 min, no new peaks were observed (Fig. S5B). But when CO2 gas flow was closed down and H2 gas proportion turned up to 5%H2/Ar, new bands appear at 1395 and 1595 cm1 (assigned to the D-band and G-band of coke, respectively [4648]), and they become sharper with reaction time as shown in Fig. S5C."

          [5] "CO2 consumes hydrogen species through the reverse water-gas shift (RWGS) reaction, which is beneficial for enhancing the equilibrium of light alkane conversion. CO2 can also oxidize active sites and stabilize the catalyst by eliminating coke through the reverse Boudouard reaction"

          [6] "CO2 can inhabit the reduction of active oxidative chromium species by excessive hydrogen species."

          The literature does not directly address promoters for enhancing CO2 activation in chromium-based catalytic systems. However, it discusses several advantages of using CO2 as an oxidant compared to O2:

          1. CO2 has lower oxidizing activity than O2, which shifts the reaction towards more olefin production by preventing deep oxidation of reactive olefins.

          2. CO2 can oxidize active sites and stabilize the catalyst by eliminating coke through the reverse Boudouard reaction.

          3. The main effect of CO2 is inhibiting coke formation rather than eliminating existing coke.

          4. The presence of CO2 prevents the formation of coke bands in Raman spectra, which appear when CO2 is removed and H2 concentration is increased.

          5. CO2 consumes hydrogen species through the reverse water-gas shift (RWGS) reaction, which enhances the equilibrium of light alkane conversion.

          6. CO2 prevents the over-reduction of active oxidative chromium species by consuming excess hydrogen.

          These properties allow CO2 to act as a milder, more selective oxidant compared to O2, potentially improving catalyst stability and product selectivity. However, the document does not discuss specific promoters or compare CO2 to O2 co-feeding strategies in detail. More research would be needed to fully answer the question about promoters enhancing CO2 activation and oxidizing ability in chromium-based systems.

          该文献并未直接讨论用于增强铬基催化系统中CO2活化的助剂。但是，它确实讨论了使用CO2作为氧化剂相比O2的几个优势：

          1. CO2的氧化活性比O2低，这使反应向更多烯烃生产方向转移，通过防止活性烯烃深度氧化。

          2. CO2可以通过逆布德瓦反应氧化活性位点并稳定催化剂，消除积碳。

          3. CO2的主要作用是抑制积碳形成，而不是消除现有积碳。

          4. CO2的存在可以防止拉曼光谱中积碳带的形成，这些积碳带在移除CO2并增加H2浓度时出现。

          5. CO2通过反向水气变换反应（RWGS）消耗氢气，这有利于增强烷烃转化的平衡。

          6. CO2通过消耗过量氢气防止活性氧化铬物种被过度还原。

          这些特性使CO2成为比O2更温和、更选择性的氧化剂，可能改善催化剂稳定性和产物选择性。然而，该文档并未详细讨论具体的助剂或将CO2与O2共进料策略进行比较。需要进行更多研究才能全面回答关于助剂增强铬基系统中CO2活化和氧化能力的问题。
