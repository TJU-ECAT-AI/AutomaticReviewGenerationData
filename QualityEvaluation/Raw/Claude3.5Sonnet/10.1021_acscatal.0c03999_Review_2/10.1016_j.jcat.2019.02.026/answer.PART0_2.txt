[1] "Recently, carbon dioxide (CO2), as a promising nonconventional oxidant for catalytic oxidative dehydrogenation of light alkanes to olefins, has drawn much attention. In comparison with molecular O2, the lower oxidizing activity of CO2 is shown to shift the ODH reaction toward more olefin production, which means that more reactive olefins are prevented for deep oxidation in the presence of CO2"

[2] "CO2 can also oxidize active sites and stabilize the catalyst by eliminating coke through the reverse Boudouard reaction"

[3] "The foremost effect of CO2 is inhibiting rather than eliminating coke."

[4] "CO2 can inhabit the reduction of active oxidative chromium species by excessive hydrogen species."

The literature does not directly address promoters for enhancing CO2 activation in chromium-based catalysts. However, it does discuss some advantages of using CO2 as an oxidant compared to O2:

1. CO2's lower oxidizing activity shifts the reaction towards more olefin production by preventing deep oxidation of reactive olefins.

2. CO2 can oxidize active sites and stabilize the catalyst by eliminating coke through the reverse Boudouard reaction. 

3. CO2 inhibits coke formation rather than primarily eliminating existing coke.

4. CO2 prevents the over-reduction of active oxidative chromium species by consuming excess hydrogen.

These properties allow CO2 to act as a milder, more selective oxidant compared to O2, potentially improving catalyst stability and product selectivity. However, the document does not discuss specific promoters or compare CO2 to O2 co-feeding strategies in detail.

该文献并未直接讨论增强铬基催化剂中CO2活化的助剂。但是，它确实讨论了使用CO2作为氧化剂相比O2的一些优势：

1. CO2较低的氧化活性使反应向更多烯烃产物方向转移，防止了活性烯烃的深度氧化。

2. CO2可以通过逆布德瓦反应氧化活性位点并稳定催化剂，消除积碳。

3. CO2主要是抑制积碳形成，而不是消除已存在的积碳。

4. CO2通过消耗过量氢气防止活性氧化铬物种被过度还原。

这些特性使CO2成为比O2更温和、更选择性的氧化剂，可能改善催化剂稳定性和产物选择性。但是，该文档并未详细讨论具体的助剂或将CO2与O2共进料策略进行比较。
