[1] "CO2, being a much milder oxidant, can effectively consume H2 under dehydrogenation conditions, although it is not reactive enough to oxidize the hydrocarbons in the reaction mixture."

[2] "The cofeeding of CO2 may result in additional coke deposition, due to the increased CO and decreased H2 partial pressures brought about by the reverse watergas shift reaction. On the other hand, coke may be gasified by CO2."

[3] "CO2 competitively adsorbs on the surface, specifically on the basic sites of the catalyst materials, which can negatively affect their performance."

</quotes>

<EnglishVersionAnswer>

The literature does not directly address how promoters enhance CO2 activation or improve its oxidizing ability in chromium-based catalytic systems for dehydrogenation reactions. The text mainly discusses the limitations of using CO2 as an oxidant, including its weak oxidation potential and potential negative effects like competitive adsorption on catalyst surfaces. 

The document does not provide specific information on promoters addressing these limitations or compare CO2 use to O2 co-feeding strategies. To properly answer this question, additional information beyond what is provided in the given literature would be needed.

文献并未直接讨论促进剂如何增强CO2的活化或改善其在铬基催化系统中的氧化能力以用于脱氢反应。文本主要讨论了使用CO2作为氧化剂的局限性，包括其弱氧化能力和潜在的负面影响，如在催化剂表面的竞争性吸附。

文献没有提供关于促进剂如何解决这些局限性的具体信息，也没有将CO2的使用与O2共进料策略进行比较。要正确回答这个问题，需要超出给定文献所提供的额外信息。

</quotes>

<EnglishVersionAnswer>

The literature does not specifically discuss how promoters address the limitations of CO2 in chromium-based catalytic systems or compare them to O2 co-feeding. The text only mentions some general effects of CO2 in dehydrogenation reactions, without detailing promoter roles or comparing to O2.

The document notes that CO2 is a mild oxidant that can consume H2 but not oxidize hydrocarbons. It may increase coke deposition through the reverse water-gas shift reaction, but can also gasify coke. CO2 competitively adsorbs on catalyst basic sites, potentially negatively affecting performance. In one case with a Ga2O3/TiO2 catalyst, CO2 and steam addition decreased coke deposition and assisted product desorption.

Without more specific information on promoters in chromium-based systems, their advantages over O2 co-feeding, or their effects on CO2 activation and selective oxidation, the question cannot be fully answered based solely on this text.

文献没有具体讨论促进剂如何解决铬基催化系统中CO2的局限性,也没有将其与O2共进料进行比较。文本仅提到了CO2在脱氢反应中的一些一般效果,没有详细说明促进剂的作用或与O2的比较。

文件指出,CO2是一种温和的氧化剂,可以消耗H2但不能氧化碳氢化合物。它可能通过逆水气变换反应增加积碳沉积,但也可以气化积碳。CO2在催化剂碱性位点上竞争性吸附,可能会对性能产生负面影响。在一个使用Ga2O3/TiO2催化剂的案例中,添加CO2和水蒸气减少了积碳沉积并协助产物脱附。

由于缺乏关于铬基系统中促进剂的更具体信息,以及它们相对于O2共进料的优势,或它们对CO2活化和选择性氧化的影响,仅基于这段文本无法全面回答这个问题。

The literature does not specifically discuss how promoters address the limitations of CO2 in chromium-based catalytic systems or compare them to O2 co-feeding. The text only mentions some general effects of CO2 in dehydrogenation reactions, without relating them to promoters or chromium catalysts specifically. Therefore, the question cannot be fully answered based on the provided information.

However, the text does note that CO2 is a milder oxidant than O2, able to consume H2 but not oxidize hydrocarbons. It can potentially both increase and decrease coke formation through different mechanisms. CO2 can also competitively adsorb on catalyst basic sites, which may negatively impact performance. These factors would likely need to be considered when developing promoters or comparing CO2 to O2 co-feeding, but the document does not provide specific details on addressing these issues or potential advantages.

文献中并没有具体讨论促进剂如何解决基于铬的催化系统中CO2的局限性,也没有将其与O2共进料进行比较。文本仅提到了CO2在脱氢反应中的一些一般性影响,而没有将其与促进剂或铬催化剂具体联系起来。因此,无法根据所提供的信息完整回答这个问题。

然而,文本确实指出CO2是一种比O2更温和的氧化剂,能够消耗H2但不会氧化碳氢化合物。它可能通过不同的机制同时增加和减少积碳形成。CO2还可以在催化剂的碱性位点上发生竞争性吸附,这可能会对性能产生负面影响。在开发促进剂或将CO2与O2共进料进行比较时,可能需要考虑这些因素,但文件并未提供解决这些问题或潜在优势的具体细节。

The literature does not directly address how promoters enhance CO2 activation or oxidizing ability in chromium-based catalytic systems for dehydrogenation. The text mainly discusses general limitations of using CO2 as an oxidant, without mentioning specific promoters or comparing CO2 to O2 co-feeding for chromium catalysts. 

However, the document does mention some general effects of CO2 in catalytic dehydrogenation:

1. CO2 can consume H2 produced during dehydrogenation, but is not reactive enough to oxidize hydrocarbons.

2. CO2 can competitively adsorb on catalyst basic sites, potentially negatively affecting performance.

3. In some systems (e.g. Ga2O3/TiO2), CO2 addition can decrease coke deposition and assist product desorption.

To properly answer the question about promoters for chromium-based systems specifically, additional information would be needed that is not provided in this literature excerpt.

这篇文献并没有直接讨论促进剂如何增强铬基催化体系中CO2的活化或氧化能力。文中主要讨论了使用CO2作为氧化剂的一般局限性,没有提到具体的促进剂或将CO2与O2共进料用于铬催化剂的比较。

然而,文献确实提到了CO2在催化脱氢中的一些普遍效果:

1. CO2可以消耗脱氢过程中产生的H2,但不足以氧化烃类。

2. CO2可以在催化剂的碱性位点上竞争性吸附,可能会对性能产生负面影响。

3. 在某些体系中(如Ga2O3/TiO2),添加CO2可以减少积碳沉积并协助产物脱附。

要正确回答有关专门针对铬基系统的促进剂的问题,需要额外的信息,而这些信息在这篇文献摘录中并未提供。

The literature does not directly address how promoters enhance CO2 activation or improve its oxidizing ability in chromium-based catalytic systems. However, it does mention some general effects of CO2 co-feeding in dehydrogenation reactions:

1. CO2 can effectively consume H2, shifting the equilibrium towards product formation, though it is not reactive enough to oxidize hydrocarbons.

2. CO2 co-feeding may have both positive and negative effects on coke formation. It can increase coke deposition due to the reverse water-gas shift reaction, but it may also gasify coke.

3. CO2 can compete for adsorption sites on the catalyst surface, potentially negatively affecting performance.

4. Some studies have shown that CO2 addition can improve olefin yield.

5. In some cases, CO2 (along with steam) has been found to decrease coke deposition and assist product desorption.

The literature does not provide information on how promoters specifically address CO2's limitations or compare their advantages to O2 co-feeding in chromium-based systems. More research would be needed to answer this question comprehensively.

文献中并未直接讨论促进剂如何增强CO2的活化或改善其在铬基催化体系中的氧化能力。但是,它确实提到了CO2共进料在脱氢反应中的一些普遍效果:

1. CO2可以有效消耗H2,将平衡向产物形成方向移动,但它不够活泼,无法氧化碳氢化合物。

2. CO2共进料可能对积碳形成产生正面和负面影响。由于逆水煤气变换反应,它可能增加积碳沉积,但也可能气化积碳。

3. CO2可能与催化剂表面的吸附位点竞争,可能对性能产生负面影响。

4. 一些研究表明,添加CO2可以提高烯烃产率。

5. 在某些情况下,发现CO2(与蒸汽一起)可以减少积碳沉积并帮助产物脱附。

文献没有提供关于促进剂如何特别解决CO2的局限性,或者与铬基系统中O2共进料相比其优势的信息。需要进行更多研究才能全面回答这个问题。
