[1] "CO2, being a much milder oxidant, can effectively consume H2 under dehydrogenation conditions, although it is not reactive enough to oxidize the hydrocarbons in the reaction mixture."

[2] "The cofeeding of CO2 may result in additional coke deposition, due to the increased CO and decreased H2 partial pressures brought about by the reverse watergas shift reaction. On the other hand, coke may be gasified by CO2."

[3] "CO2 competitively adsorbs on the surface, specifically on the basic sites of the catalyst materials, which can negatively affect their performance."

[4] "Nakagawa et al. found that the addition of steam and CO2 decreased coke deposition on a Ga2O3/TiO2 catalyst by the Boudouart reaction, while also assisting ethylene desorption."

The literature does not specifically discuss how promoters address the limitations of CO2 in chromium-based catalytic systems or compare them to O2 co-feeding. The text only mentions some general effects of CO2 in dehydrogenation reactions, without detailing promoter roles or comparing to O2.

The document notes that CO2 is a mild oxidant that can consume H2 but not oxidize hydrocarbons. It may increase coke deposition through the reverse water-gas shift reaction, but can also gasify coke. CO2 competitively adsorbs on catalyst basic sites, potentially negatively affecting performance. In one case with a Ga2O3/TiO2 catalyst, CO2 and steam addition decreased coke deposition and assisted product desorption.

Without more specific information on promoters in chromium-based systems, their advantages over O2 co-feeding, or their effects on CO2 activation and selective oxidation, the question cannot be fully answered based solely on this text.

文献没有具体讨论促进剂如何解决铬基催化系统中CO2的局限性,也没有将其与O2共进料进行比较。文本仅提到了CO2在脱氢反应中的一些一般效果,没有详细说明促进剂的作用或与O2的比较。

文件指出,CO2是一种温和的氧化剂,可以消耗H2但不能氧化碳氢化合物。它可能通过逆水气变换反应增加积碳沉积,但也可以气化积碳。CO2在催化剂碱性位点上竞争性吸附,可能会对性能产生负面影响。在一个使用Ga2O3/TiO2催化剂的案例中,添加CO2和水蒸气减少了积碳沉积并协助产物脱附。

由于缺乏关于铬基系统中促进剂的更具体信息,以及它们相对于O2共进料的优势,或它们对CO2活化和选择性氧化的影响,仅基于这段文本无法全面回答这个问题。
