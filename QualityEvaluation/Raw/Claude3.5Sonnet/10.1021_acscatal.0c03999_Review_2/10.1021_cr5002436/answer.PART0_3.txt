[1] "CO2, being a much milder oxidant, can effectively consume H2 under dehydrogenation conditions, although it is not reactive enough to oxidize the hydrocarbons in the reaction mixture."

[2] "Finally, CO2 competitively adsorbs on the surface, specifically on the basic sites of the catalyst materials, which can negatively affect their performance."

[3] "Nakagawa et al. found that the addition of steam and CO2 decreased coke deposition on a Ga2O3/TiO2 catalyst by the Boudouart reaction, while also assisting ethylene desorption."

The literature does not directly address how promoters enhance CO2 activation or oxidizing ability in chromium-based catalytic systems for dehydrogenation. The text mainly discusses general limitations of using CO2 as an oxidant, without mentioning specific promoters or comparing CO2 to O2 co-feeding for chromium catalysts. 

However, the document does mention some general effects of CO2 in catalytic dehydrogenation:

1. CO2 can consume H2 produced during dehydrogenation, but is not reactive enough to oxidize hydrocarbons.

2. CO2 can competitively adsorb on catalyst basic sites, potentially negatively affecting performance.

3. In some systems (e.g. Ga2O3/TiO2), CO2 addition can decrease coke deposition and assist product desorption.

To properly answer the question about promoters for chromium-based systems specifically, additional information would be needed that is not provided in this literature excerpt.

这篇文献并没有直接讨论促进剂如何增强铬基催化体系中CO2的活化或氧化能力。文中主要讨论了使用CO2作为氧化剂的一般局限性,没有提到具体的促进剂或将CO2与O2共进料用于铬催化剂的比较。

然而,文献确实提到了CO2在催化脱氢中的一些普遍效果:

1. CO2可以消耗脱氢过程中产生的H2,但不足以氧化烃类。

2. CO2可以在催化剂的碱性位点上竞争性吸附,可能会对性能产生负面影响。

3. 在某些体系中(如Ga2O3/TiO2),添加CO2可以减少积碳沉积并协助产物脱附。

要正确回答有关专门针对铬基系统的促进剂的问题,需要额外的信息,而这些信息在这篇文献摘录中并未提供。
