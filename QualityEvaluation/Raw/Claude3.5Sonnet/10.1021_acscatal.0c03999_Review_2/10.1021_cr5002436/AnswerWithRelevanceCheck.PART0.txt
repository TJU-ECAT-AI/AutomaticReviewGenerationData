          [1] "CO2, being a much milder oxidant, can effectively consume H2 under dehydrogenation conditions, although it is not reactive enough to oxidize the hydrocarbons in the reaction mixture."

[2] "The cofeeding of CO2 may result in additional coke deposition, due to the increased CO and decreased H2 partial pressures brought about by the reverse watergas shift reaction. On the other hand, coke may be gasified by CO2."

[3] "CO2 competitively adsorbs on the surface, specifically on the basic sites of the catalyst materials, which can negatively affect their performance."

[4] "A number of studies have shown that the addition of CO2 to the reactant feed improves the olefin yield."

[5] "Nakagawa et al. found that the addition of steam and CO2 decreased coke deposition on a Ga2O3/TiO2 catalyst by the Boudouart reaction, while also assisting ethylene desorption."

          The literature does not directly address how promoters enhance CO2 activation or improve its oxidizing ability in chromium-based catalytic systems for dehydrogenation. The text mainly discusses general effects and limitations of using CO2 as an oxidant, without mentioning specific promoters or comparing CO2 to O2 co-feeding for chromium catalysts. 

However, the document does mention some general effects of CO2 in catalytic dehydrogenation:

1. CO2 is a milder oxidant than O2, able to consume H2 but not oxidize hydrocarbons.
2. CO2 co-feeding may have both positive and negative effects on coke formation. It can increase coke deposition due to the reverse water-gas shift reaction, but it may also gasify coke.
3. CO2 can competitively adsorb on catalyst basic sites, potentially negatively affecting performance.
4. Some studies have shown that CO2 addition can improve olefin yield.
5. In some systems (e.g., Ga2O3/TiO2), CO2 addition (along with steam) can decrease coke deposition and assist product desorption.

To properly answer the question about promoters for chromium-based systems specifically, their advantages over O2 co-feeding, or their effects on CO2 activation and selective oxidation, additional information would be needed that is not provided in this literature excerpt.

          文献并未直接讨论促进剂如何增强CO2的活化或改善其在铬基催化系统中的氧化能力。文本主要讨论了使用CO2作为氧化剂的一般效果和局限性，没有提到具体的促进剂或将CO2与O2共进料用于铬催化剂的比较。

然而，文献确实提到了CO2在催化脱氢中的一些普遍效果：

1. CO2是比O2更温和的氧化剂，能够消耗H2但不能氧化碳氢化合物。
2. CO2共进料可能对积碳形成产生正面和负面影响。由于逆水煤气变换反应，它可能增加积碳沉积，但也可能气化积碳。
3. CO2可以在催化剂的碱性位点上竞争性吸附，可能会对性能产生负面影响。
4. 一些研究表明，添加CO2可以提高烯烃产率。
5. 在某些体系中（如Ga2O3/TiO2），添加CO2（与蒸汽一起）可以减少积碳沉积并协助产物脱附。

要正确回答有关专门针对铬基系统的促进剂、它们相对于O2共进料的优势，或它们对CO2活化和选择性氧化的影响的问题，需要额外的信息，而这些信息在这篇文献摘录中并未提供。
