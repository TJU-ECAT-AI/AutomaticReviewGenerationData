[1] "CO2, being a much milder oxidant, can effectively consume H2 under dehydrogenation conditions, although it is not reactive enough to oxidize the hydrocarbons in the reaction mixture."

[2] "The cofeeding of CO2 may result in additional coke deposition, due to the increased CO and decreased H2 partial pressures brought about by the reverse watergas shift reaction. On the other hand, coke may be gasified by CO2."

[3] "Finally, CO2 competitively adsorbs on the surface, specifically on the basic sites of the catalyst materials, which can negatively affect their performance."

[4] "A number of studies have shown that the addition of CO2 to the reactant feed improves the olefin yield."

[5] "Nakagawa et al. found that the addition of steam and CO2 decreased coke deposition on a Ga2O3/TiO2 catalyst by the Boudouart reaction, while also assisting ethylene desorption."

The literature does not directly address how promoters enhance CO2 activation or improve its oxidizing ability in chromium-based catalytic systems. However, it does mention some general effects of CO2 co-feeding in dehydrogenation reactions:

1. CO2 can effectively consume H2, shifting the equilibrium towards product formation, though it is not reactive enough to oxidize hydrocarbons.

2. CO2 co-feeding may have both positive and negative effects on coke formation. It can increase coke deposition due to the reverse water-gas shift reaction, but it may also gasify coke.

3. CO2 can compete for adsorption sites on the catalyst surface, potentially negatively affecting performance.

4. Some studies have shown that CO2 addition can improve olefin yield.

5. In some cases, CO2 (along with steam) has been found to decrease coke deposition and assist product desorption.

The literature does not provide information on how promoters specifically address CO2's limitations or compare their advantages to O2 co-feeding in chromium-based systems. More research would be needed to answer this question comprehensively.

文献中并未直接讨论促进剂如何增强CO2的活化或改善其在铬基催化体系中的氧化能力。但是,它确实提到了CO2共进料在脱氢反应中的一些普遍效果:

1. CO2可以有效消耗H2,将平衡向产物形成方向移动,但它不够活泼,无法氧化碳氢化合物。

2. CO2共进料可能对积碳形成产生正面和负面影响。由于逆水煤气变换反应,它可能增加积碳沉积,但也可能气化积碳。

3. CO2可能与催化剂表面的吸附位点竞争,可能对性能产生负面影响。

4. 一些研究表明,添加CO2可以提高烯烃产率。

5. 在某些情况下,发现CO2(与蒸汽一起)可以减少积碳沉积并帮助产物脱附。

文献没有提供关于促进剂如何特别解决CO2的局限性,或者与铬基系统中O2共进料相比其优势的信息。需要进行更多研究才能全面回答这个问题。
