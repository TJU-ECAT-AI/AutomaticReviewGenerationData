[1] "CO2, being a much milder oxidant, can effectively consume H2 under dehydrogenation conditions, although it is not reactive enough to oxidize the hydrocarbons in the reaction mixture."

[2] "The cofeeding of CO2 may result in additional coke deposition, due to the increased CO and decreased H2 partial pressures brought about by the reverse watergas shift reaction. On the other hand, coke may be gasified by CO2."

[3] "Finally, CO2 competitively adsorbs on the surface, specifically on the basic sites of the catalyst materials, which can negatively affect their performance."

The literature does not specifically discuss how promoters address the limitations of CO2 in chromium-based catalytic systems or compare them to O2 co-feeding. The text only mentions some general effects of CO2 in dehydrogenation reactions, without relating them to promoters or chromium catalysts specifically. Therefore, the question cannot be fully answered based on the provided information.

However, the text does note that CO2 is a milder oxidant than O2, able to consume H2 but not oxidize hydrocarbons. It can potentially both increase and decrease coke formation through different mechanisms. CO2 can also competitively adsorb on catalyst basic sites, which may negatively impact performance. These factors would likely need to be considered when developing promoters or comparing CO2 to O2 co-feeding, but the document does not provide specific details on addressing these issues or potential advantages.

文献中并没有具体讨论促进剂如何解决基于铬的催化系统中CO2的局限性,也没有将其与O2共进料进行比较。文本仅提到了CO2在脱氢反应中的一些一般性影响,而没有将其与促进剂或铬催化剂具体联系起来。因此,无法根据所提供的信息完整回答这个问题。

然而,文本确实指出CO2是一种比O2更温和的氧化剂,能够消耗H2但不会氧化碳氢化合物。它可能通过不同的机制同时增加和减少积碳形成。CO2还可以在催化剂的碱性位点上发生竞争性吸附,这可能会对性能产生负面影响。在开发促进剂或将CO2与O2共进料进行比较时,可能需要考虑这些因素,但文件并未提供解决这些问题或潜在优势的具体细节。
