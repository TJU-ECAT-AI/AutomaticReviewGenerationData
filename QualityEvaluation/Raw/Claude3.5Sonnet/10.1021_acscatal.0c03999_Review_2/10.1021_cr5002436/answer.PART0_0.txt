[1] "CO2, being a much milder oxidant, can effectively consume H2 under dehydrogenation conditions, although it is not reactive enough to oxidize the hydrocarbons in the reaction mixture."

[2] "The cofeeding of CO2 may result in additional coke deposition, due to the increased CO and decreased H2 partial pressures brought about by the reverse watergas shift reaction. On the other hand, coke may be gasified by CO2."

[3] "CO2 competitively adsorbs on the surface, specifically on the basic sites of the catalyst materials, which can negatively affect their performance."

<EnglishVersionAnswer>

The literature does not directly address how promoters enhance CO2 activation or improve its oxidizing ability in chromium-based catalytic systems for dehydrogenation reactions. The text mainly discusses the limitations of using CO2 as an oxidant, including its weak oxidation potential and potential negative effects like competitive adsorption on catalyst surfaces. 

The document does not provide specific information on promoters addressing these limitations or compare CO2 use to O2 co-feeding strategies. To properly answer this question, additional information beyond what is provided in the given literature would be needed.

文献并未直接讨论促进剂如何增强CO2的活化或改善其在铬基催化系统中的氧化能力以用于脱氢反应。文本主要讨论了使用CO2作为氧化剂的局限性，包括其弱氧化能力和潜在的负面影响，如在催化剂表面的竞争性吸附。

文献没有提供关于促进剂如何解决这些局限性的具体信息，也没有将CO2的使用与O2共进料策略进行比较。要正确回答这个问题，需要超出给定文献所提供的额外信息。
