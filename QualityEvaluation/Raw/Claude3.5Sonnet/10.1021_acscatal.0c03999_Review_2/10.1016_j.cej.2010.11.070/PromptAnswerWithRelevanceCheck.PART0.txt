Read the questions and answers provided below. First, critically assess the overall relevance of the answers provided to the set of questions asked.

If, upon your assessment, you find that the answers do not contain information that is relevant to the questions asked, stop your review process immediately and respond with a single sentence: "※※※※※※※The provided answers are not relevant to the questions.※※※※※※※". Do not provide any additional explanation or background information, only this sentence should be given as a response in case of irrelevant answers.

If, however, the answers are relevant to the questions asked, proceed to compile answers for each question according to the instructions below. Ensure to aggregate all the relevant answers from the multiple answer results provided in the document, and organize them sequentially by their order number, compiling the corresponding quotes, English answers, and Chinese answers for each question.

If the provided answers' quotes are not differentiated by question, ensure to break them down and assign the quotes to each respective question, outputting them separately within each question's section.

To provide a comprehensive review, differentiate the responses into quotes, English answers, and Chinese answers for each question based on the details given in the 'Answer' XML tags. Structure your review using the XML format showcased below if the answers are relevant to the questions asked:

<EnglishVersionAnswer>

The given scientific literature does not contain any information about promoters addressing limitations of CO2's weak oxidation potential or inertness in chromium-based catalytic systems. The document focuses on describing the preparation and characterization of CrOx/SiO2 catalysts using metal vapor synthesis, and their performance in propane oxidative dehydrogenation using CO2 as a mild oxidant. It does not discuss promoters, CO2 activation strategies, or comparisons with O2 co-feeding. Therefore, this question cannot be answered based on the information provided in the document.

The given literature does not contain any information about promoters addressing limitations of CO2's weak oxidation potential or inertness in chromium-based catalytic systems. The document focuses on describing the preparation and characterization of chromium-based catalysts using metal vapor synthesis, but does not discuss promoters or compare CO2 activation strategies. There is no mention of O2 co-feeding or other approaches for enhancing CO2 activation. The paper is primarily about catalyst preparation methods and characterization, rather than strategies for improving CO2 utilization. Therefore, this specific question cannot be answered based on the given text.
