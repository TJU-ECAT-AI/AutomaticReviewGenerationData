Abstract
The oxidative dehydrogenation of propane on rare earth vanadates is always
in competition with the total oxidation of the alkane which leads to the
formation of C02 and CO. Addition of C02 into the feed results in an increased
C3H6 selectivity together with a decreased CO formation through the total
oxidation of the alkane or the formed alkene. For the tested rare earth
vanadates as well as for the niobium. promoted catalysts an enhancement of the
C3H6 selectivity at isoconversion and thus of the C3H6 yields is observed upon
C02 addition into the feed.
1. INTRODUCTION
Rare
earth
vanadates
are
suitable
catalysts
for
the
oxidative
dehydrogenation of alkanes and were more particularly tested in that reaction
with propane and butane [l-S]. Further, it was shown that these definite
compounds with huttonite (LaV04) or zirkon (other rare earth vanadates)
structures [6] have better performances than catalysts prepared by mixing the
two oxides (La203 - V20S) or the impregnation ofone of these oxides by a salt of
the other component [7,8]. Even more, the definite compounds are much more
stable in the high temperature range (400 to 600°C) of propane dehydrogenation
than the mixtures or impregnates.
The oxidative dehydrogenation of propane is always in competition with the
total oxidation of propane or of the formed propene producing CO and C02 as
shown in the following scheme:

Previous mechanistic studies [9-13] on the oxidative dehydrogenation of
propane are in accordance with a Mars-van Krevelen mechanism involving
the oxygen of the surface of the catalyst in the dehydrogenation reaction and
molecular oxygen in the formation of CO and C02. Each reaction takes place,
in fact, on a specific catalytic site [12].
1050
In order to diminish the unavoidable total oxidation, most of the authors
working on various catalytic systems propose to modify the reaction
conditions: decrease of the 02/CaHs
ratio, of the contact time and/or the
reaction temperature [la]. In most of the experiments an increase of selectivity
and a decrease of activity were observed, but the selectivity at isoconversion
remains constant and the CaH6 yield is never significantly enhanced.
It was found, in our laboratory, that the formation of CaH6 at a given
conversion can be improved by two different means for rare earth vanadates
1- by blocking the basic oxidating sites of the catalytic surface (e.g. rare
earth oxide sites) by promotion of the catalyst with another oxide like
Nb205, MoOa or Bi20a which reacts with the rare earth oxide not involved
in the structure [S]
2- by the addition of C02 into the feed, the absorption - desorption
equilibrium of C02 on the surface, probably on the basic oxidation sites,
decreasing thus the amount of molecular oxygen which is believed to be
responsible for the total oxidation of propane.
The aim of the present work is to study the second possibility and to optimize
the feed composition of the oxidative propane dehydrogenation on rare earth
vanadates.
2. EXPERIMENTAL
LnV04 (Ln = rare earth) catalysts were prepared by a sol-gel process by
precipitation of the precursor from aqueous solutions of rare earth nitrates and
ammonium vanadates. The dried precipitate was annealed in air at T =600°C
during 2 hours. The calcination process was followed by TG and TPD. The BET
surface areas of the prepared vanadates, measured by N2 physisoption are

The XRD analysis of the final products are in accordance with data of
reference 6 and with the corresponding JCPDS powder diffraction files.
The promoted catalyst are prepared by excipient wetness impregnation of the
vanadates by the precursors of the given promotors (as an example Nb(OCHa)5
for Nb205) according to reference S.
The dehydrogenation reaction was performed in a U tube quartz reactor
(inner diameter 6 mm) containing 0.5 g of catalysts. The gas feed is prepared
on line with four massflow regulators and its composition can be changed
within a large range. Thus the flow rate is always maintained at 61 h-1 g-1 and
the most used standard conditions are :
Feed (550): 5 02, 5 CaHs, 50 He (ml min-I)
Feed (555) : 5 02, 5 CaHs, 5 C02 45 He (ml min-I)
After reaction the formed products ~e analyzed on line by GC.

3. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
3.1. Oxidationofpropane on a PrV04 catalyst.
In presence of a PrV04 catalyst the reaction of C3H8 + 02 results in the
formation of propene as well as CO and C02 as combustion products. The
cracking reactions are, below 600°C, of minor importance and their
selectivities remain lower than 1%.
The addition of C02 into the feed results mainly in a decrease of the total
conversion and an increase of the C3H6 selectivity (figure 1).

Reaction conditions: Feed (500) and (555), SV= 61 gcat-1 h-l.
An enhancement of the C3H6 yield from 7.3% to 8.7% at 500°C as well as an
increase of the C3H6 selectivity at isoconversion, from 42% to 49% at 10%
conversion, were observed in the condition of figure 1.
Comparing the product distribution at the different temperatures of the
reaction on PrV04 with a 02 + C3H8 (550) feed (figure 2) and with
02+C3H8+C02 (555) (figure 3). It can be seen that, together with the reported
increase of the C3H6 selectivity, a detrimental effect on the CO formation is
obtained by addition ofC02.
This result is in agreement with a simultaneous formation of CO, C02 and
not with consecutive reactions (C3H8 and/or C3H6 ---> CO ---> C02) for the
main mechanism of total oxidation of propane.

3.2. Reaction in presence
ofother rare earth vanadate.
The catalytic behaviour of the vanadates depends on the reductibility of the
rare earth cations [1,2,5]. The influence of C02 addition in the feed results on
the tested rare earth vanadates (e.g. LaV04, CeV04, SmV04 and ErV04) by a
decrease of the total conversion as well as an increase of the CaH6 selectivity
and yield (figure 4).

3.3. Influence ofthe amount ofadded CO2
Some authors [14-15] have considered that C02 is a mild oxidant and can be
used in the catalytic oxidation of alkanes. The dehydrogenation of propane,
over Cr203 and Ga203 containing catalysts was investigated.
In our reaction conditions, on rare earth vanadates it was found that in
absence of oxygen but in presence of C02, the propene formation was very low
and could be attributed for a minor part to a purely thermal reaction but was
mainly due to the reaction of oxygen from the bulk of the catalyst.
Table 1 shows that with fresh LaV04 the CgH6 formation is always low and
drops with time. After a run with a 02 + C3HS + C02 feed and the switch to a
C02 + C3HS feed, the formation of C3H6 decreases with time. The production of
CO + C02 drops faster than that of propene, this can be attributed to the
consumption of chemisorbed and bulk oxygen during the reactions with an
oxygen free feed. This observation fits well with the proposal that C3H6 and
carbon oxides are formed through two different pathways on two different
catalytic sites [12] .
In a further set of experiments the 02 and C3H6 flows are kept constant but
increasing amounts of C02 were added at constant flow rates (balance with
He). The selectivity increases clearly for 0.5 and 1 equivalent volumes (to C3HS
vol) of C02. Thus a 5% absolute decrease of the conversion can be observed upon
addition of an equivalent (related to the propane) volume of C02 (figure 6). In a
similar way a 7% C3H6 selectivity increase is obtained by the equivalent
addition of C02.

A higher C02 content leads only to low changes in the conversion and the
selectivity remains almost constant.
If one considers the product distribution in these experiments, it can be seen
(figure 7) that the increase of C3H6 and C02 formation appears together with a
sharp decrease of CO. These observations are in good agreement with that of
the other tests and the proposed hypothesis that CO and C02 are formed on
different sites [12] .

As it can be seen in our results, the effect of C02 addition to the feed is less
discernable for high conversions. This can be explained by the in-situ
formation of more C02 during the reaction at higher conversion. Indeed, it has
been shown in the part about the influence of the amount of C02, that a
minimum concentration of C02 is required to reach the best selectivity. These
observations suggest that the influence of C02 can be attributed to a
competition between molecular 02 and C02 adsorption sites or the sites
responsible for oxidation Krylov [16] has proposed. The formation of carbonates
can account for the disappearance of the total oxidation sites in CH4 + C02. In
our case, carbonates could not be evidenced by IRFT on the vanadates with a
relatively strong acidic character.
3.4 ReactiononNiobium promoted.catalysts
Nb20S itself, as a bulk catalyst or supported on Si02, was proposed as a
catalyst for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane. As additive on V20S and
Mo03-V20S catalysts [17-19], Nb20S has been shown to decrease the total
oxidation of ethane and propane and thus to increase the selectivity in olefin
formation.
In the presence of rare earth vanadate catalysts, a comparable selectivity
increase is observed [S] and can be explained by the blocking of the highly
1056
oxidating La203 sites by a possible formation of Ln-Nb-Ox definite compounds,
which are less active in total oxidation.
On a LaV04 catalyst promoted by increased amounts of Nb205, an
enhancement of both the CaH6 selectivity and yield can be obtained by adding
C02 into the feed (figure 8). Itcan be mentioned that the combined promoting
effect of adding niobium oxide to a LaV04 catalyst and C02 into the feed results
in a CaH6 selectivity increase from 22% to a7%.

The selectivities at isoconversion for CaH6+02 and CaH6+02+C02 feeds on
LaV04 promoted with increased amounts of Nb20S are given on figure 9 and
illustrate well the positive effect ofC02 addition to the reaction mixture.
The selectivity increase by C02 addition into the feed is not limited to LaV04
but can also be observed for the other tested vanadates (PrV04,SmV04 and
ErV04). As shown on figure 10, a similar enhancement of CaH6 selectivities
and yields is obtained for various Nb promoted rare earth vanadates. On the
Nb20S promoted catalyst the influence of the addition of C02 to the feed is
however lower than for the unpromoted ones. This observation could be in good
agreement with the proposed assumption that Nb20S and C02 have both an
effect on the sites oftotal oxidation of propane.

4. CONCLUSION
The oxidative dehydrogenation of propane on rare earth vanadates can be
successfully optimized by addition of C02, in equimolar amount with 02 and
C3H8, in the feed. It results mainly in a decrease of the total oxidation of
propane increasing thus the C3H6 selectivity and yield.
The depressing of the CO and C02 formation seems to result from the
blocking of the total oxidation sites of the catalyst by reversible chemisorption of
C02. The effect of C02 addition is thus of less importance at high conversion
since enough C02 is formed in the reaction to block the basic oxidating sites of
the catalyst.
On niobium promoted catalysts as well as for other promoted systems an
additional increase in C3H6 selectivity is also observed after addition of C02 on
the feed. Itseems therefore that the promoting effect of C02 evidenced at first
for LaV04 can also be observed on most of the promoted and unpromoted
catalysts based on combinations of rare earth and vanadium oxides.
