[1] "The introduction of oxidizing agents (O2, CO2) makes it possible to decrease the resulting coke amount. Furthermore, an oxidizing agent interacts with hydrogen to shift the thermodynamic equilibrium of the dehydrogenation reaction toward the formation of olefins."

[2] "The use of CO2 makes it possible to increase the process selectivity and the stability of catalysts."

[3] "The best promoter was K, and its content changed from 0.1 to 1.0% (by weight). The optimum potassium content of the 5% CrOx/SiO2 catalyst was 0.20.4%. At these K concentrations in the catalyst, the selectivity of the formation of propene was 100% at a 22% conversion of propane."

[4] "The positive role of potassium was discovered at the ratio Cr : K = 20 on the catalyst containing 3.0% chromium and at the ratio Cr : K = 6.5 on the catalyst with 2.0%. The chromium content should not be higher than 3.0% since the catalysts with high chromium contents are irreversibly deactivated."

Promoters like potassium address the limitations of CO2's weak oxidation potential and inertness in chromium-based catalytic systems by improving catalyst selectivity and stability. They offer several advantages over O2 co-feeding:

1. Increased process selectivity: The use of CO2 with promoters allows for higher selectivity in olefin formation compared to O2.

2. Enhanced catalyst stability: Promoters like potassium improve the stability of chromium oxide catalysts, allowing for longer operational times.

3. Reduced coke formation: The introduction of CO2 as an oxidizing agent helps decrease coke deposition on the catalyst surface.

4. Optimized reaction equilibrium: CO2 interacts with hydrogen to shift the thermodynamic equilibrium towards olefin formation.

5. Tunable performance: The ratio of chromium to potassium can be optimized to achieve the best catalytic performance, with specific ratios found for different chromium contents.

6. Prevention of deep oxidation: Unlike O2, which can lead to unwanted deep oxidation of paraffins and olefins, CO2 allows for more controlled and selective oxidation.

7. Improved conversion rates: With optimal promoter concentrations, high selectivity can be achieved even at moderate conversion rates.

These advantages make promoter-enhanced, CO2-assisted dehydrogenation an attractive alternative to O2 co-feeding for achieving selective and stable catalytic performance in the production of olefins from paraffins.

Promoters like potassium address the limitations of CO2's weak oxidation potential and inertness in chromium-based catalytic systems in several ways:

1. They help decrease coke formation, which is a major issue in dehydrogenation reactions. This improves catalyst stability and longevity.

2. They enhance the interaction between CO2 and hydrogen, shifting the equilibrium towards olefin formation. This improves the oxidizing ability of CO2.

3. They increase the selectivity of the process, leading to higher yields of desired products like propene.

4. They improve the overall stability of the catalysts, allowing for longer operation times without significant loss of activity.

Compared to O2 co-feeding, using CO2 with promoters offers several advantages:

1. Higher selectivity: CO2 is less likely to cause deep oxidation of paraffins and olefins compared to O2.

2. Better stability: Catalysts promoted with alkali metals like potassium show improved stability over longer periods.

3. Improved catalyst performance: The right concentration of promoters (e.g., 0.2-0.4% K for 5% CrOx/SiO2) can lead to very high selectivity (up to 100%) for propene formation.

4. Utilization of waste gas: CO2 is often present in mine gases, making its use in this process environmentally beneficial.

While O2 co-feeding can make the process more exothermic and allow for lower operating temperatures, the use of CO2 with proper promoters offers a more selective and stable catalytic performance, which is crucial for industrial applications.

2. 更好的稳定性：用钾等碱金属促进的催化剂在更长时间内表现出更好的稳定性。

3. 改善的催化剂性能：适当浓度的促进剂（例如，5% CrOx/SiO2催化剂中0.2-0.4%的K）可以导致丙烯形成的极高选择性（高达100%）。

4. 废气利用：二氧化碳常存在于矿井气中，使其在这个过程中的使用具有环境效益。

虽然氧气共进料可以使过程更具放热性并允许在较低的操作温度下进行，但使用二氧化碳和适当的促进剂可以提供更具选择性和稳定性的催化性能，这对工业应用至关重要。

1. They enhance CO2 activation and improve its oxidizing ability. The addition of promoters like potassium helps shift the thermodynamic equilibrium of the dehydrogenation reaction towards olefin formation by facilitating CO2's interaction with hydrogen.

2. Promoters increase process selectivity. The use of CO2 along with promoters like potassium allows for higher selectivity compared to using O2 as an oxidizing agent. This is because CO2 is less likely to cause deep oxidation of paraffins and olefins.

3. They improve catalyst stability. Promoters, especially potassium, have been shown to increase the stability of chromium oxide catalysts. This allows for longer catalyst lifetimes and sustained performance over extended periods.

4. Promoters enhance propene yield and selectivity. For example, optimum potassium content in CrOx/SiO2 catalysts resulted in 100% selectivity for propene formation at 22% propane conversion.

5. They reduce coke formation. The introduction of oxidizing agents like CO2, coupled with promoters, helps decrease coke deposition on the catalyst surface.

Compared to O2 co-feeding, using CO2 with promoters offers advantages in terms of selectivity and stability. While O2 can lead to unwanted deep oxidation, CO2 provides a milder oxidizing environment, and when combined with promoters like potassium, it allows for more selective and stable catalytic performance in propane dehydrogenation reactions.
