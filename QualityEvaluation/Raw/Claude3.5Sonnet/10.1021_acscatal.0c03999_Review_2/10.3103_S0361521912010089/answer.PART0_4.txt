[1] "The introduction of oxidizing agents (O2, CO2) makes it possible to decrease the resulting coke amount. Furthermore, an oxidizing agent interacts with hydrogen to shift the thermodynamic equilibrium of the dehydrogenation reaction toward the formation of olefins."

[2] "The use of CO2 makes it possible to increase the process selectivity and the stability of catalysts."

[3] "The introduction of alkaline promoters into chromium oxide catalysts is one of the ways of increasing the effectiveness of them."

[4] "The best promoter was K, and its content changed from 0.1 to 1.0% (by weight). The optimum potassium content of the 5% CrOx/SiO2 catalyst was 0.20.4%. At these K concentrations in the catalyst, the selectivity of the formation of propene was 100% at a 22% conversion of propane."

Promoters, particularly alkaline metals like potassium, address the limitations of CO2's weak oxidation potential and inertness in chromium-based catalytic systems in several ways:

1. They increase the effectiveness of chromium oxide catalysts overall.

2. They help improve process selectivity and catalyst stability when using CO2 as an oxidizing agent.

3. Specifically for potassium, it can significantly enhance selectivity - achieving 100% selectivity for propene formation at certain concentrations.

4. Promoters like potassium help decrease coke formation, which is a major issue in dehydrogenation reactions.

5. They assist in shifting the thermodynamic equilibrium towards olefin formation by interacting with hydrogen.

Compared to O2 co-feeding, CO2 with promoters offers advantages in terms of:

1. Higher selectivity - O2 can lead to deep oxidation of paraffins and olefins, while CO2 with promoters allows for more selective reactions.

2. Better stability - catalysts tend to be more stable when using CO2 with promoters compared to O2.

3. Improved catalyst lifetime - by reducing coke formation, promoters help extend catalyst life compared to O2 co-feeding which can lead to faster deactivation.

4. More controlled oxidation - CO2 provides a milder oxidizing environment compared to O2, allowing for better control of the reaction when combined with promoters.

While the document doesn't provide direct comparisons to O2 co-feeding for all aspects, it suggests that the combination of CO2 and promoters offers a more selective, stable, and controlled approach to oxidative dehydrogenation of lower paraffins.

助剂，特别是钾等碱金属，通过以下几种方式解决了二氧化碳在铬基催化系统中氧化能力弱和惰性的限制：

1. 它们提高了铬氧化物催化剂的整体效果。

2. 在使用二氧化碳作为氧化剂时，它们有助于提高过程选择性和催化剂稳定性。

3. 特别是对于钾，在某些浓度下可以显著提高选择性 - 实现100%的丙烯形成选择性。

4. 钾等助剂有助于减少积碳形成，这是脱氢反应中的一个主要问题。

5. 它们通过与氢相互作用，帮助将热力学平衡转向烯烃形成。

与O2共馈相比，使用助剂的CO2在以下方面具有优势：

1. 更高的选择性 - O2可能导致烷烃和烯烃的深度氧化，而使用助剂的CO2允许更选择性的反应。

2. 更好的稳定性 - 使用带助剂的CO2时，催化剂往往比使用O2更稳定。

3. 改善催化剂寿命 - 通过减少积碳形成，助剂有助于延长催化剂寿命，而O2共馈可能导致更快的失活。

4. 更可控的氧化 - 与O2相比，CO2提供了一个更温和的氧化环境，当与助剂结合时，可以更好地控制反应。

虽然文档没有提供与O2共馈的所有方面的直接比较，但它表明CO2和助剂的组合为低级烷烃的氧化脱氢提供了一种更具选择性、稳定性和可控性的方法。
