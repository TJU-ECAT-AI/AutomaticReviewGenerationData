[1] "The introduction of oxidizing agents (O2, CO2) makes it possible to decrease the resulting coke amount. Furthermore, an oxidizing agent interacts with hydrogen to shift the thermodynamic equilibrium of the dehydrogenation reaction toward the formation of olefins."

[2] "The use of CO2 makes it possible to increase the process selectivity and the stability of catalysts."

[3] "The best promoter was K, and its content changed from 0.1 to 1.0% (by weight). The optimum potassium content of the 5% CrOx/SiO2 catalyst was 0.20.4%. At these K concentrations in the catalyst, the selectivity of the formation of propene was 100% at a 22% conversion of propane."

[4] "The introduction of potassium into the chromium oxide catalysts can be effective for increasing their stability and selectivity. On the catalyst containing 2.0% Cr and 0.31% K, the yield of propene was at a high level for 60 h, and the selectivity of the formation of propene on it was higher than on the chromium oxide catalyst without K."

Promoters like potassium address the limitations of CO2's weak oxidation potential and inertness in chromium-based catalytic systems in several ways:

1. They enhance CO2 activation and improve its oxidizing ability. The addition of promoters like potassium helps shift the thermodynamic equilibrium of the dehydrogenation reaction towards olefin formation by facilitating CO2's interaction with hydrogen.

2. Promoters increase process selectivity. The use of CO2 along with promoters like potassium allows for higher selectivity compared to using O2 as an oxidizing agent. This is because CO2 is less likely to cause deep oxidation of paraffins and olefins.

3. They improve catalyst stability. Promoters, especially potassium, have been shown to increase the stability of chromium oxide catalysts. This allows for longer catalyst lifetimes and sustained performance over extended periods.

4. Promoters enhance propene yield and selectivity. For example, optimum potassium content in CrOx/SiO2 catalysts resulted in 100% selectivity for propene formation at 22% propane conversion.

5. They reduce coke formation. The introduction of oxidizing agents like CO2, coupled with promoters, helps decrease coke deposition on the catalyst surface.

Compared to O2 co-feeding, using CO2 with promoters offers advantages in terms of selectivity and stability. While O2 can lead to unwanted deep oxidation, CO2 provides a milder oxidizing environment, and when combined with promoters like potassium, it allows for more selective and stable catalytic performance in propane dehydrogenation reactions.

促进剂（如钾）通过以下几种方式解决了二氧化碳在铬基催化系统中氧化能力弱和惰性的局限性：

1. 它们增强了二氧化碳的活化能力并改善了其氧化能力。添加钾等促进剂有助于通过促进二氧化碳与氢的相互作用，将脱氢反应的热力学平衡向烯烃形成方向转移。

2. 促进剂提高了过程的选择性。与使用氧气作为氧化剂相比，使用二氧化碳和钾等促进剂可以获得更高的选择性。这是因为二氧化碳不太可能导致烷烃和烯烃的深度氧化。

3. 它们提高了催化剂的稳定性。促进剂，特别是钾，已被证明可以提高铬氧化物催化剂的稳定性。这允许催化剂寿命更长，并在较长时间内保持性能。

4. 促进剂提高了丙烯的产率和选择性。例如，在CrOx/SiO2催化剂中，最佳钾含量可在22%的丙烷转化率下实现100%的丙烯形成选择性。

5. 它们减少了积炭形成。引入二氧化碳等氧化剂，再加上促进剂，有助于减少催化剂表面的积炭沉积。

与氧气共进料相比，使用二氧化碳和促进剂在选择性和稳定性方面具有优势。虽然氧气可能导致不需要的深度氧化，但二氧化碳提供了更温和的氧化环境，当与钾等促进剂结合时，它允许在丙烷脱氢反应中实现更具选择性和稳定性的催化性能。
