          [1] "The introduction of oxidizing agents (O2, CO2) makes it possible to decrease the resulting coke amount. Furthermore, an oxidizing agent interacts with hydrogen to shift the thermodynamic equilibrium of the dehydrogenation reaction toward the formation of olefins."

[2] "The use of CO2 makes it possible to increase the process selectivity and the stability of catalysts."

[3] "The best promoter was K, and its content changed from 0.1 to 1.0% (by weight). The optimum potassium content of the 5% CrOx/SiO2 catalyst was 0.20.4%. At these K concentrations in the catalyst, the selectivity of the formation of propene was 100% at a 22% conversion of propane."

[4] "The introduction of potassium into the chromium oxide catalysts can be effective for increasing their stability and selectivity. On the catalyst containing 2.0% Cr and 0.31% K, the yield of propene was at a high level for 60 h, and the selectivity of the formation of propene on it was higher than on the chromium oxide catalyst without K."

[5] "The introduction of alkaline promoters into chromium oxide catalysts is one of the ways of increasing the effectiveness of them."

          Promoters, particularly alkaline promoters like potassium, address the limitations of CO2's weak oxidation potential and inertness in chromium-based catalytic systems in several ways:

1. Enhanced CO2 activation: Promoters help shift the thermodynamic equilibrium of the dehydrogenation reaction towards olefin formation by facilitating CO2's interaction with hydrogen.

2. Improved oxidizing ability: The addition of promoters like potassium increases the effectiveness of CO2 as an oxidizing agent.

3. Increased selectivity: CO2 with promoters allows for higher selectivity compared to using O2 as an oxidizing agent. For example, optimum potassium content in CrOx/SiO2 catalysts resulted in 100% selectivity for propene formation at 22% propane conversion.

4. Enhanced catalyst stability: Promoters, especially potassium, have been shown to increase the stability of chromium oxide catalysts, allowing for longer catalyst lifetimes and sustained performance over extended periods.

5. Reduced coke formation: The introduction of CO2 as an oxidizing agent, coupled with promoters, helps decrease coke deposition on the catalyst surface.

Compared to O2 co-feeding, using CO2 with promoters offers several advantages:

1. Higher selectivity: CO2 is less likely to cause deep oxidation of paraffins and olefins compared to O2.

2. Better stability: Catalysts promoted with alkali metals like potassium show improved stability over longer periods.

3. More controlled oxidation: CO2 provides a milder oxidizing environment compared to O2, allowing for better control of the reaction when combined with promoters.

4. Improved catalyst lifetime: By reducing coke formation, promoters help extend catalyst life compared to O2 co-feeding, which can lead to faster deactivation.

5. Environmental benefits: CO2 utilization in this process can be environmentally beneficial, especially when using CO2 from waste gases.

Overall, the use of promoters with CO2 provides a more selective, stable, and controlled catalytic performance compared to O2 co-feeding, while still addressing coke formation issues and shifting equilibrium favorably towards olefin production.

          促进剂，特别是钾等碱性促进剂，通过以下几种方式解决了二氧化碳在铬基催化系统中氧化能力弱和惰性的限制：

1. 增强二氧化碳活化：促进剂通过促进二氧化碳与氢的相互作用，帮助将脱氢反应的热力学平衡向烯烃形成方向转移。

2. 改善氧化能力：添加钾等促进剂提高了二氧化碳作为氧化剂的有效性。

3. 提高选择性：与使用氧气作为氧化剂相比，使用二氧化碳和促进剂可以获得更高的选择性。例如，在CrOx/SiO2催化剂中，最佳钾含量可在22%的丙烷转化率下实现100%的丙烯形成选择性。

4. 增强催化剂稳定性：促进剂，特别是钾，已被证明可以提高铬氧化物催化剂的稳定性，允许催化剂寿命更长，并在较长时间内保持性能。

5. 减少积碳形成：引入二氧化碳作为氧化剂，再加上促进剂，有助于减少催化剂表面的积碳沉积。

与氧气共进料相比，使用二氧化碳和促进剂提供了几个优势：

1. 更高的选择性：与氧气相比，二氧化碳不太可能导致烷烃和烯烃的深度氧化。

2. 更好的稳定性：用钾等碱金属促进的催化剂在更长时间内表现出更好的稳定性。

3. 更可控的氧化：与氧气相比，二氧化碳提供了一个更温和的氧化环境，当与促进剂结合时，可以更好地控制反应。

4. 改善催化剂寿命：通过减少积碳形成，促进剂有助于延长催化剂寿命，而氧气共进料可能导致更快的失活。

5. 环境效益：在这个过程中利用二氧化碳可以带来环境效益，特别是当使用来自废气的二氧化碳时。

总的来说，与氧气共进料相比，使用促进剂和二氧化碳提供了更具选择性、稳定性和可控性的催化性能，同时仍然解决了积碳形成问题，并有利地将平衡转向烯烃生产。
