[1] "The introduction of oxidizing agents (O2, CO2) makes it possible to decrease the resulting coke amount. Furthermore, an oxidizing agent interacts with hydrogen to shift the thermodynamic equilibrium of the dehydrogenation reaction toward the formation of olefins."

[2] "The use of CO2 makes it possible to increase the process selectivity and the stability of catalysts."

[3] "The best promoter was K, and its content changed from 0.1 to 1.0% (by weight). The optimum potassium content of the 5% CrOx/SiO2 catalyst was 0.20.4%. At these K concentrations in the catalyst, the selectivity of the formation of propene was 100% at a 22% conversion of propane."

[4] "The positive role of potassium was discovered at the ratio Cr : K = 20 on the catalyst containing 3.0% chromium and at the ratio Cr : K = 6.5 on the catalyst with 2.0%. The chromium content should not be higher than 3.0% since the catalysts with high chromium contents are irreversibly deactivated."

Promoters like potassium address the limitations of CO2's weak oxidation potential and inertness in chromium-based catalytic systems by improving catalyst selectivity and stability. They offer several advantages over O2 co-feeding:

1. Increased process selectivity: The use of CO2 with promoters allows for higher selectivity in olefin formation compared to O2.

2. Enhanced catalyst stability: Promoters like potassium improve the stability of chromium oxide catalysts, allowing for longer operational times.

3. Reduced coke formation: The introduction of CO2 as an oxidizing agent helps decrease coke deposition on the catalyst surface.

4. Optimized reaction equilibrium: CO2 interacts with hydrogen to shift the thermodynamic equilibrium towards olefin formation.

5. Tunable performance: The ratio of chromium to potassium can be optimized to achieve the best catalytic performance, with specific ratios found for different chromium contents.

6. Prevention of deep oxidation: Unlike O2, which can lead to unwanted deep oxidation of paraffins and olefins, CO2 allows for more controlled and selective oxidation.

7. Improved conversion rates: With optimal promoter concentrations, high selectivity can be achieved even at moderate conversion rates.

These advantages make promoter-enhanced, CO2-assisted dehydrogenation an attractive alternative to O2 co-feeding for achieving selective and stable catalytic performance in the production of olefins from paraffins.

促进剂（如钾）通过提高催化剂的选择性和稳定性，解决了二氧化碳在铬基催化系统中氧化能力弱和惰性的限制。与氧气共进料相比，它们提供了几个优势：

1. 提高工艺选择性：使用二氧化碳和促进剂可以比使用氧气获得更高的烯烃形成选择性。

2. 增强催化剂稳定性：像钾这样的促进剂可以提高铬氧化物催化剂的稳定性，延长运行时间。

3. 减少积碳形成：引入二氧化碳作为氧化剂有助于减少催化剂表面的积碳沉积。

4. 优化反应平衡：二氧化碳与氢气相互作用，将热力学平衡转向烯烃的形成。

5. 可调性能：可以优化铬与钾的比例以获得最佳的催化性能，不同的铬含量有特定的最佳比例。

6. 防止深度氧化：与可能导致烷烃和烯烃不需要的深度氧化的氧气不同，二氧化碳允许更可控和选择性的氧化。

7. 提高转化率：在最佳促进剂浓度下，即使在中等转化率下也能实现高选择性。

这些优势使得促进剂增强、二氧化碳辅助的脱氢成为氧气共进料的有吸引力的替代方案，可在烷烃生产烯烃过程中实现选择性和稳定的催化性能。
