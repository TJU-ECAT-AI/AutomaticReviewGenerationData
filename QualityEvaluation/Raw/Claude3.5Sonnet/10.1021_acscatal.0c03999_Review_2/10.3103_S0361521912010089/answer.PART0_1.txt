[1] "The introduction of oxidizing agents (O2, CO2) makes it possible to decrease the resulting coke amount. Furthermore, an oxidizing agent interacts with hydrogen to shift the thermodynamic equilibrium of the dehydrogenation reaction toward the formation of olefins."

[2] "The use of CO2 makes it possible to increase the process selectivity and the stability of catalysts."

[3] "The best promoter was K, and its content changed from 0.1 to 1.0% (by weight). The optimum potassium content of the 5% CrOx/SiO2 catalyst was 0.20.4%. At these K concentrations in the catalyst, the selectivity of the formation of propene was 100% at a 22% conversion of propane."

[4] "The introduction of potassium into the chromium oxide catalysts can be effective for increasing their stability and selectivity. On the catalyst containing 2.0% Cr and 0.31% K, the yield of propene was at a high level for 60 h, and the selectivity of the formation of propene on it was higher than on the chromium oxide catalyst without K."

Promoters like potassium address the limitations of CO2's weak oxidation potential and inertness in chromium-based catalytic systems in several ways:

1. They help decrease coke formation, which is a major issue in dehydrogenation reactions. This improves catalyst stability and longevity.

2. They enhance the interaction between CO2 and hydrogen, shifting the equilibrium towards olefin formation. This improves the oxidizing ability of CO2.

3. They increase the selectivity of the process, leading to higher yields of desired products like propene.

4. They improve the overall stability of the catalysts, allowing for longer operation times without significant loss of activity.

Compared to O2 co-feeding, using CO2 with promoters offers several advantages:

1. Higher selectivity: CO2 is less likely to cause deep oxidation of paraffins and olefins compared to O2.

2. Better stability: Catalysts promoted with alkali metals like potassium show improved stability over longer periods.

3. Improved catalyst performance: The right concentration of promoters (e.g., 0.2-0.4% K for 5% CrOx/SiO2) can lead to very high selectivity (up to 100%) for propene formation.

4. Utilization of waste gas: CO2 is often present in mine gases, making its use in this process environmentally beneficial.

While O2 co-feeding can make the process more exothermic and allow for lower operating temperatures, the use of CO2 with proper promoters offers a more selective and stable catalytic performance, which is crucial for industrial applications.

促进剂（如钾）通过以下几种方式解决了二氧化碳在铬基催化系统中氧化能力弱和惰性的限制：

1. 它们有助于减少积碳形成，这是脱氢反应中的一个主要问题。这提高了催化剂的稳定性和寿命。

2. 它们增强了二氧化碳和氢之间的相互作用，将平衡向烯烃形成方向移动。这提高了二氧化碳的氧化能力。

3. 它们提高了过程的选择性，导致所需产品（如丙烯）的产率更高。

4. 它们提高了催化剂的整体稳定性，允许在不显著损失活性的情况下延长操作时间。

与氧气共进料相比，使用二氧化碳和促进剂提供了几个优势：

1. 更高的选择性：与氧气相比，二氧化碳不太可能导致烷烃和烯烃的深度氧化。

2. 更好的稳定性：用钾等碱金属促进的催化剂在更长时间内表现出更好的稳定性。

3. 改善的催化剂性能：适当浓度的促进剂（例如，5% CrOx/SiO2催化剂中0.2-0.4%的K）可以导致丙烯形成的极高选择性（高达100%）。

4. 废气利用：二氧化碳常存在于矿井气中，使其在这个过程中的使用具有环境效益。

虽然氧气共进料可以使过程更具放热性并允许在较低的操作温度下进行，但使用二氧化碳和适当的促进剂可以提供更具选择性和稳定性的催化性能，这对工业应用至关重要。
