[1] "The introduction of oxidizing agents (O2, CO2) makes it possible to decrease the resulting coke amount. Furthermore, an oxidizing agent interacts with hydrogen to shift the thermodynamic equilibrium of the dehydrogenation reaction toward the formation of olefins."

[2] "The use of CO2 makes it possible to increase the process selectivity and the stability of catalysts."

[3] "The introduction of alkaline promoters into chromium oxide catalysts is one of the ways of increasing the effectiveness of them."

[4] "The best promoter was K, and its content changed from 0.1 to 1.0% (by weight). The optimum potassium content of the 5% CrOx/SiO2 catalyst was 0.2–0.4%. At these K concentrations in the catalyst, the selectivity of the formation of propene was 100% at a 22% conversion of propane."

Promoters, particularly alkaline promoters like potassium, address the limitations of CO2's weak oxidation potential and inertness in chromium-based catalytic systems in several ways:

1. They increase the effectiveness of chromium oxide catalysts overall.

2. They help increase the process selectivity and stability of catalysts when using CO2.

3. Specifically for potassium, it can significantly improve selectivity - achieving 100% selectivity for propene formation at certain concentrations.

4. Promoters like potassium can help optimize catalyst performance at relatively low concentrations (0.2-0.4% for a 5% CrOx/SiO2 catalyst).

Compared to O2 co-feeding, using CO2 with promoters offers advantages in terms of:

1. Increased selectivity - CO2 allows for higher process selectivity than O2.

2. Improved catalyst stability - CO2 enhances catalyst stability more than O2.

3. Reduced deep oxidation - CO2 is less likely to cause unwanted deep oxidation of products compared to O2.

4. Better coke reduction - While both O2 and CO2 can decrease coke formation, CO2 does so while maintaining higher selectivity.

Overall, the use of promoters with CO2 provides a more selective and stable catalytic performance compared to O2 co-feeding, while still addressing coke formation issues and shifting equilibrium favorably.

助剂，特别是钾等碱性助剂，通过以下几种方式解决了二氧化碳在铬基催化体系中氧化能力弱和惰性的限制：

1. 它们整体上提高了氧化铬催化剂的效率。

2. 它们有助于在使用二氧化碳时提高过程的选择性和催化剂的稳定性。

3. 特别是对于钾来说，它可以显著提高选择性 - 在某些浓度下实现100%的丙烯形成选择性。

4. 钾等助剂可以在相对较低的浓度下（5% CrOx/SiO2催化剂的0.2-0.4%）帮助优化催化剂性能。

与O2共进料相比，使用CO2和助剂在以下方面提供了优势：

1. 提高选择性 - CO2允许比O2更高的过程选择性。

2. 改善催化剂稳定性 - CO2比O2更能提高催化剂稳定性。

3. 减少深度氧化 - 与O2相比，CO2不太可能导致产品的不需要的深度氧化。

4. 更好的积碳减少 - 虽然O2和CO2都可以减少积碳形成，但CO2在保持较高选择性的同时做到这一点。

总的来说，与O2共进料相比，使用助剂和CO2提供了更具选择性和稳定性的催化性能，同时仍然解决了积碳形成问题并有利地改变了平衡。
