[1] "Hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) is a burgeoning catalyst for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) with impressive light olefins selectivity, which deserves further study to optimize the heat and mass transfer process with the aim of promoting the potential industrial application since ODHP is a highly exothermic process."

[2] "h-BN wash-coated cordierite monolithic catalyst was designed through a chemical vapor deposition method using boron acid and urea as precursors"

[3] "The typical structure of h-BN/Cordierite with well-developed straight-channel and short diffusive pathway of the thin wash-coated h-BN layer guarantee the mass transfer process at high GHSV, achieving a high propylene space time yield of 18.6 gC3H6 gBN1h1 and improving the selectivity towards propylene and ethylene by suppressing secondary reactions of deep oxidation."

[4] "The well-developed straight-channel structure of h-BN/Cordierite provides space for gas phase radical reactions, thus, propane conversion over h-BN/Cordierite is higher than that over h-BN powder."

The h-BN/Cordierite catalyst described in the literature exhibits 3-D dispersed active sites in a porous framework, which enhances catalytic performance in several ways:

1. Improved mass transfer: The well-developed straight-channel structure of the cordierite support and thin wash-coated h-BN layer create short diffusion pathways, enabling efficient mass transfer even at high gas hourly space velocities (GHSV).

2. Enhanced heat transfer: The monolithic structure and excellent thermal conductivity of h-BN help optimize heat transfer during the highly exothermic ODHP reaction, reducing hot spots and suppressing secondary deep oxidation reactions.

3. Increased active site accessibility: The thin h-BN layer coated on the cordierite surface improves the utilization of active sites compared to bulk h-BN powder.

4. Facilitated gas-phase reactions: The straight-channel structure provides space for gas-phase radical reactions, contributing to higher propane conversion.

The method used to incorporate B active components into the structure is chemical vapor deposition (CVD) using boric acid and urea as precursors. This approach is effective for creating a thin, uniform h-BN layer on the cordierite support, resulting in improved catalytic performance compared to bulk h-BN powder. The CVD method allows for precise control of the h-BN loading and ensures strong adhesion between the active layer and the support.

For ODHP applications, this method is particularly effective as it creates a catalyst with high selectivity towards light olefins and excellent productivity. The thin h-BN layer and monolithic structure optimize mass and heat transfer, making it attractive for potential industrial applications. However, the effectiveness of this method for other catalytic applications would depend on the specific reaction requirements and the desired catalyst properties.

文献中描述的h-BN/堇青石催化剂在多孔框架中展现了三维分散的活性位点，这通过以下几种方式增强了催化性能：

1. 改善的质量传递：堇青石支撑体的发达直通道结构和薄层涂覆的h-BN层创造了短扩散路径，即使在高气体时空速度（GHSV）下也能实现高效的质量传递。

2. 增强的热传递：整体式结构和h-BN优异的热导率有助于优化高度放热的ODHP反应中的热传递，减少热点并抑制二次深度氧化反应。

3. 提高活性位点可及性：涂覆在堇青石表面的薄h-BN层相比于块状h-BN粉末提高了活性位点的利用率。

4. 促进气相反应：直通道结构为气相自由基反应提供了空间，有助于提高丙烷转化率。

将B活性组分引入结构的方法是使用硼酸和尿素作为前驱体的化学气相沉积（CVD）。这种方法能有效地在堇青石支撑体上创建薄而均匀的h-BN层，与块状h-BN粉末相比，结果显示出更好的催化性能。CVD方法允许精确控制h-BN的负载量，并确保活性层与支撑体之间的强附着力。

对于ODHP应用，这种方法特别有效，因为它创造了一种对轻烯烃具有高选择性和优异生产力的催化剂。薄h-BN层和整体式结构优化了质量和热传递，使其对潜在的工业应用具有吸引力。然而，这种方法对其他催化应用的有效性将取决于特定反应要求和所需的催化剂性能。
