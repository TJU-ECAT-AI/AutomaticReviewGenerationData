[1] "h-BN wash-coated cordierite monolithic catalyst was designed through a chemical vapor deposition method using boron acid and urea as precursors"

[2] "The typical structure of h-BN/Cordierite with well-developed straight-channel and short diffusive pathway of the thin wash-coated h-BN layer guarantee the mass transfer process at high GHSV, achieving a high propylene space time yield of 18.6 gC3H6 gBN1h1 and improving the selectivity towards propylene and ethylene by suppressing secondary reactions of deep oxidation."

[3] "Combining with the stability test result, we conclude that the mechanical stability is excellent, which was probably attributed to the outstanding adhesiveness between boron-based compounds and cordierite, no extra binders are needed in the wash-coating process."

[4] "The hydrogen bonds interaction can be formed between the surface OH of cordierite and BOH groups of H3BO3. In addition, CVD process could strength the interaction of boron species with cordierite in the form of BOSi and BOAl, which contributes to the outstanding adhesiveness between h-BN layer and cordierite."

The literature describes a hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) wash-coated cordierite monolithic catalyst for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP). This structure enhances catalytic performance through several key features:

1. Well-developed straight channels and thin h-BN layer: This structure optimizes mass transfer, especially at high gas hourly space velocity (GHSV), leading to improved propylene yield and selectivity.

2. 3-D dispersed active sites: The h-BN is uniformly dispersed over the cordierite support, providing accessible active sites throughout the catalyst structure.

3. Strong adhesion: The h-BN layer adheres well to the cordierite support without additional binders, improving mechanical stability.

The method used to incorporate B active components is chemical vapor deposition (CVD) using boric acid and urea as precursors. This method is effective because:

1. It creates a uniform, thin layer of h-BN on the cordierite surface.
2. It promotes strong interactions between the h-BN and the cordierite support through hydrogen bonding and the formation of B-O-Si and B-O-Al linkages.
3. It allows for control of the h-BN loading by adjusting precursor concentrations.

This approach is particularly effective for ODHP, as it creates a catalyst with high selectivity and productivity for propylene. The structure's ability to suppress deep oxidation reactions is especially valuable for this application. However, the effectiveness of this method for other catalytic applications would depend on the specific reaction requirements and whether the unique properties of h-BN (e.g., thermal stability, chemical inertness) are beneficial for the desired reaction.

该文献描述了一种用于丙烷氧化脱氢(ODHP)的六方氮化硼(h-BN)涂覆堇青石整体催化剂。这种结构通过几个关键特征提高了催化性能：

1. 发达的直通道和薄的h-BN层：这种结构优化了物质传递，尤其是在高气体小时空速(GHSV)下，提高了丙烯产率和选择性。

2. 3-D分散的活性位点：h-BN均匀分散在堇青石载体上，在整个催化剂结构中提供可接触的活性位点。

3. 强粘附性：h-BN层与堇青石载体之间有很好的粘附性，无需额外粘合剂，提高了机械稳定性。

用于incorporatng B活性成分的方法是化学气相沉积(CVD)，使用硼酸和尿素作为前驱体。这种方法之所以有效，是因为：

1. 它在堇青石表面创造了均匀、薄的h-BN层。
2. 通过氢键和B-O-Si和B-O-Al键的形成，促进了h-BN与堇青石载体之间的强相互作用。
3. 它允许通过调整前驱体浓度来控制h-BN的负载量。

这种方法对ODHP特别有效，因为它创造了一种对丙烯具有高选择性和生产力的催化剂。该结构抑制深度氧化反应的能力对这一应用特别有价值。然而，这种方法对其他催化应用的有效性将取决于特定反应的要求，以及h-BN的独特性质（如热稳定性、化学惰性）是否对所需反应有益。
