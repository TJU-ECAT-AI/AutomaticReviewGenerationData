[1] "Hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) is a burgeoning catalyst for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) with impressive light olefins selectivity, which deserves further study to optimize the heat and mass transfer process with the aim of promoting the potential industrial application since ODHP is a highly exothermic process."

[2] "The typical structure of h-BN/Cordierite with well-developed straight-channel and short diffusive pathway of the thin wash-coated h-BN layer guarantee the mass transfer process at high GHSV, achieving a high propylene space time yield of 18.6 gC3H6 gBN1h1 and improving the selectivity towards propylene and ethylene by suppressing secondary reactions of deep oxidation."

[3] "h-BN/Cordierite catalyst was prepared by a two-step method. H3BO3 was first deposited onto the cordierite by hydrogen bonds interaction through a dip-coating method. The H3BO3 was converted into B2O3 by heating and then reacted with NH3 derived from decomposition of urea to generate h-BN layers"

[4] "Combined XRD and IR analysis, we confirm that boron nitride is successfully wash-coated on the cordierite with uniform dispersion by CVD method."

The structural characteristics of B-based materials with 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks, as described in the literature, primarily focus on hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) wash-coated on cordierite monolithic catalysts. These structures enhance catalytic performance in several ways:

1. Improved mass transfer: The h-BN/Cordierite structure features well-developed straight channels and a thin wash-coated h-BN layer, which provides a short diffusive pathway. This design ensures efficient mass transfer, especially at high gas hourly space velocities (GHSV).

2. Enhanced heat transfer: The monolithic structure and excellent thermal conductivity of h-BN contribute to better heat transfer during reactions, which is crucial for the highly exothermic oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) process.

3. Increased selectivity: The optimized structure suppresses secondary reactions of deep oxidation, thereby improving selectivity towards desired products like propylene and ethylene.

4. High space time yield: The catalyst achieves a high propylene space time yield of 18.6 gC3H6 gBN-1h-1, indicating efficient utilization of the active sites.

The method used to incorporate B active components into these structures involves a two-step process:

1. Dip-coating: H3BO3 is first deposited onto the cordierite through hydrogen bond interactions using a dip-coating method.

2. Chemical Vapor Deposition (CVD): The H3BO3 is converted to B2O3 by heating, then reacted with NH3 (derived from urea decomposition) to generate h-BN layers.

This method proves effective in creating a uniformly dispersed h-BN layer on the cordierite surface, as confirmed by XRD and IR analysis. The effectiveness of this approach is demonstrated by the catalyst's high performance in ODHP reactions, showing good conversion rates, high selectivity, and impressive stability.

For ODHP applications, this method appears highly effective. However, its relative effectiveness for other catalytic applications is not discussed in the given literature. Further research would be needed to evaluate its suitability for different catalytic processes.

文献中描述的具有三维分散活性位点的B基材料在多孔框架中的结构特征主要集中在六方氮化硼（h-BN）涂覆在堇青石整体催化剂上。这些结构通过以下几种方式增强催化性能：

1. 改善质量传递：h-BN/堇青石结构具有发达的直通道和薄的h-BN涂层，提供了短的扩散路径。这种设计确保了高气体小时空速（GHSV）下的有效质量传递。

2. 增强热传递：整体结构和h-BN优异的热导率有助于反应过程中的热传递，这对于高度放热的丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）过程至关重要。

3. 提高选择性：优化的结构抑制了深度氧化的二次反应，从而提高了对丙烯和乙烯等目标产物的选择性。

4. 高空时产率：催化剂实现了18.6 gC3H6 gBN-1h-1的高丙烯空时产率，表明活性位点的利用效率高。

将B活性组分引入这些结构的方法涉及两个步骤：

1. 浸渍涂层：首先通过氢键相互作用，使用浸渍涂层法将H3BO3沉积到堇青石上。

2. 化学气相沉积（CVD）：通过加热将H3BO3转化为B2O3，然后与NH3（由尿素分解产生）反应生成h-BN层。

这种方法在堇青石表面创建均匀分散的h-BN层方面证明是有效的，这通过XRD和IR分析得到确认。该方法的有效性通过催化剂在ODHP反应中的高性能得到证明，显示出良好的转化率、高选择性和令人印象深刻的稳定性。

对于ODHP应用，这种方法似乎非常有效。然而，给定的文献中没有讨论它对其他催化应用的相对有效性。需要进一步的研究来评估其对不同催化过程的适用性。
