[1] "Hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) is a burgeoning catalyst for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) with impressive light olefins selectivity, which deserves further study to optimize the heat and mass transfer process with the aim of promoting the potential industrial application since ODHP is a highly exothermic process."

[2] "h-BN wash-coated cordierite monolithic catalyst was designed through a chemical vapor deposition method using boron acid and urea as precursors"

[3] "The typical structure of h-BN/Cordierite with well-developed straight-channel and short diffusive pathway of the thin wash-coated h-BN layer guarantee the mass transfer process at high GHSV, achieving a high propylene space time yield of 18.6 gC3H6 gBN1h1 and improving the selectivity towards propylene and ethylene by suppressing secondary reactions of deep oxidation."

[4] "The well-developed straight-channel structure of h-BN/Cordierite provides space for gas phase radical reactions, thus, propane conversion over h-BN/Cordierite is higher than that over h-BN powder."

[5] "Considering that the cordierite was composed of Al2O3, MgO and SiO2, hydroxyl groups will present on the surface of cordierite. The hydrogen bonds interaction can be formed between the surface OH of cordierite and BOH groups of H3BO3. In addition, CVD process could strength the interaction of boron species with cordierite in the form of BOSi and BOAl, which contributes to the outstanding adhesiveness between h-BN layer and cordierite."

The literature describes a hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) catalyst dispersed on a cordierite monolith support for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP). This structure enhances catalytic performance in several ways:

1. The well-developed straight channels of the cordierite monolith provide space for gas-phase radical reactions, improving propane conversion compared to powder h-BN.

2. The thin wash-coated h-BN layer on the cordierite surface creates a short diffusive pathway, optimizing mass transfer at high gas hourly space velocities (GHSV).

3. The 3D structure helps manage heat transfer in the highly exothermic ODHP reaction, suppressing secondary deep oxidation reactions and improving selectivity towards propylene and ethylene.

The method used to incorporate the B active component is chemical vapor deposition (CVD) using boric acid and urea as precursors. This method is effective because:

1. It creates a thin, uniform layer of h-BN on the cordierite surface, maximizing the utilization of the active material.

2. The CVD process strengthens the interaction between boron species and the cordierite support through BOSi and BOAl bonds.

3. Hydrogen bonding between surface OH groups on the cordierite and BOH groups from the boric acid precursor enhances adhesion of the catalyst layer.

This method appears particularly effective for ODHP, as it creates a catalyst with high activity, selectivity, and stability. However, its effectiveness for other catalytic applications would depend on the specific reaction requirements and whether the benefits of the monolithic structure (improved mass and heat transfer, high GHSV operation) are advantageous for those reactions.

这篇文献描述了一种分散在堇青石整体支撑体上的六方氮化硼（h-BN）催化剂，用于丙烷的氧化脱氢（ODHP）。这种结构通过以下几种方式提高了催化性能：

1. 堇青石整体支撑体的发达直通道结构为气相自由基反应提供了空间，与粉末状h-BN相比，提高了丙烷转化率。

2. 堇青石表面的薄层h-BN涂层创造了短扩散路径，在高气体小时空速（GHSV）下优化了质量传递。

3. 三维结构有助于管理高度放热的ODHP反应中的热传递，抑制了二次深度氧化反应，提高了丙烯和乙烯的选择性。

用于引入B活性组分的方法是化学气相沉积（CVD），使用硼酸和尿素作为前驱体。这种方法之所以有效，是因为：

1. 它在堇青石表面创造了一层薄而均匀的h-BN层，最大限度地利用了活性材料。

2. CVD过程通过BOSi和BOAl键加强了硼物种与堇青石支撑体之间的相互作用。

3. 堇青石表面OH基团与硼酸前驱体的BOH基团之间的氢键增强了催化剂层的粘附性。

这种方法对ODHP特别有效，因为它创造了一种具有高活性、选择性和稳定性的催化剂。然而，它对其他催化应用的有效性将取决于特定反应的要求，以及整体结构的优势（改善的质量和热传递，高GHSV操作）是否对这些反应有利。
