[1] "Hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) is a burgeoning catalyst for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) with impressive light olefins selectivity, which deserves further study to optimize the heat and mass transfer process with the aim of promoting the potential industrial application since ODHP is a highly exothermic process."

[2] "The typical structure of h-BN/Cordierite with well-developed straight-channel and short diffusive pathway of the thin wash-coated h-BN layer guarantee the mass transfer process at high GHSV, achieving a high propylene space time yield of 18.6 gC3H6 gBN−1h−1 and improving the selectivity towards propylene and ethylene by suppressing secondary reactions of deep oxidation."

[3] "h-BN/Cordierite catalyst was prepared by a two-step method. H3BO3 was first deposited onto the cordierite by hydrogen bonds interaction through a dip-coating method. The H3BO3 was converted into B2O3 by heating and then reacted with NH3 derived from decomposition of urea to generate h-BN layers"

[4] "The well-developed straight-channel structure of h-BN/Cordierite provides space for gas phase radical reactions, thus, propane conversion over h-BN/Cordierite is higher than that over h-BN powder."

The structural characteristics of B-based materials with 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks, such as h-BN/Cordierite, enhance catalytic performance in several ways:

1. Improved mass transfer: The well-developed straight-channel structure and thin wash-coated h-BN layer provide short diffusive pathways, ensuring efficient mass transfer even at high gas hourly space velocities (GHSV).

2. Enhanced heat transfer: The monolithic structure and excellent thermal conductivity of h-BN help optimize heat transfer during reactions, which is crucial for highly exothermic processes like ODHP.

3. Increased active site accessibility: The thin layer of h-BN coated on the cordierite surface improves the utilization of active sites, making them more accessible to reactants.

4. Suppression of secondary reactions: The optimized structure helps suppress deep oxidation reactions, leading to improved selectivity towards desired products like propylene and ethylene.

The method used to incorporate B active components into these structures involves a two-step process:

1. Dip-coating: H3BO3 is deposited onto the cordierite support through hydrogen bond interactions.

2. Chemical vapor deposition (CVD): The coated H3BO3 is converted to B2O3 by heating and then reacted with NH3 (derived from urea decomposition) to generate h-BN layers.

This method is effective for ODHP catalysis, as it creates a uniform and thin layer of h-BN on the cordierite surface. The process results in strong adhesion between the h-BN layer and the support, contributing to catalyst stability and durability.

For ODHP applications, this incorporation method is particularly effective as it creates a catalyst with high selectivity towards light olefins and improved productivity compared to traditional powder catalysts. The monolithic structure also allows for better control of reaction conditions, such as temperature and contact time, which are crucial for optimizing ODHP performance.

While this method has shown great promise for ODHP, its effectiveness for other catalytic applications would depend on the specific reaction requirements and desired catalyst properties. For reactions that require higher surface areas or different types of active sites, alternative incorporation methods might be more suitable.

具有三维分散活性位点的B基材料在多孔框架中的结构特征，如h-BN/堇青石，通过以下几种方式提高催化性能：

1. 改善质量传递：发达的直通道结构和薄的涂覆h-BN层提供了短的扩散路径，确保即使在高气体小时空速（GHSV）下也能实现高效的质量传递。

2. 增强热传递：整体结构和h-BN优异的热导率有助于优化反应过程中的热传递，这对于ODHP等强放热过程至关重要。

3. 提高活性位点可及性：涂覆在堇青石表面的薄层h-BN提高了活性位点的利用率，使反应物更容易接触到这些位点。

4. 抑制次级反应：优化的结构有助于抑制深度氧化反应，从而提高了对丙烯和乙烯等目标产物的选择性。

将B活性组分引入这些结构的方法涉及两个步骤：

1. 浸涂法：通过氢键相互作用将H3BO3沉积到堇青石载体上。

2. 化学气相沉积（CVD）：通过加热将涂覆的H3BO3转化为B2O3，然后与NH3（由尿素分解产生）反应生成h-BN层。

这种方法对ODHP催化非常有效，因为它在堇青石表面创建了均匀且薄的h-BN层。该过程使h-BN层与载体之间形成了强粘附力，有助于催化剂的稳定性和耐久性。

对于ODHP应用，这种引入方法特别有效，因为它创造了一种对轻烯烃具有高选择性和改善生产力的催化剂，相比传统的粉末催化剂更为优越。整体结构还允许更好地控制反应条件，如温度和接触时间，这对于优化ODHP性能至关重要。

虽然这种方法在ODHP方面显示出巨大潜力，但对其他催化应用的有效性将取决于特定的反应要求和所需的催化剂性质。对于需要更高比表面积或不同类型活性位点的反应，可能需要采用其他引入方法。

The structural characteristics of B-based materials with 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks, as described in the literature, primarily focus on hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) wash-coated on cordierite monolithic catalysts. These structures enhance catalytic performance in several ways:

1. Improved mass transfer: The h-BN/Cordierite structure features well-developed straight channels and a thin wash-coated h-BN layer, which provides a short diffusive pathway. This design ensures efficient mass transfer, especially at high gas hourly space velocities (GHSV).

2. Enhanced heat transfer: The monolithic structure and excellent thermal conductivity of h-BN contribute to better heat transfer during reactions, which is crucial for the highly exothermic oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) process.

3. Increased selectivity: The optimized structure suppresses secondary reactions of deep oxidation, thereby improving selectivity towards desired products like propylene and ethylene.

4. High space time yield: The catalyst achieves a high propylene space time yield of 18.6 gC3H6 gBN-1h-1, indicating efficient utilization of the active sites.

The method used to incorporate B active components into these structures involves a two-step process:

1. Dip-coating: H3BO3 is first deposited onto the cordierite through hydrogen bond interactions using a dip-coating method.

2. Chemical Vapor Deposition (CVD): The H3BO3 is converted to B2O3 by heating, then reacted with NH3 (derived from urea decomposition) to generate h-BN layers.

This method proves effective in creating a uniformly dispersed h-BN layer on the cordierite surface, as confirmed by XRD and IR analysis. The effectiveness of this approach is demonstrated by the catalyst's high performance in ODHP reactions, showing good conversion rates, high selectivity, and impressive stability.

For ODHP applications, this method appears highly effective. However, its relative effectiveness for other catalytic applications is not discussed in the given literature. Further research would be needed to evaluate its suitability for different catalytic processes.

The literature describes a hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) catalyst dispersed on a cordierite monolith support for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP). This structure enhances catalytic performance in several ways:

1. The well-developed straight channels of the cordierite monolith provide space for gas-phase radical reactions, improving propane conversion compared to powder h-BN.

2. The thin wash-coated h-BN layer on the cordierite surface creates a short diffusive pathway, optimizing mass transfer at high gas hourly space velocities (GHSV).

3. The 3D structure helps manage heat transfer in the highly exothermic ODHP reaction, suppressing secondary deep oxidation reactions and improving selectivity towards propylene and ethylene.

The method used to incorporate the B active component is chemical vapor deposition (CVD) using boric acid and urea as precursors. This method is effective because:

1. It creates a thin, uniform layer of h-BN on the cordierite surface, maximizing the utilization of the active material.

2. The CVD process strengthens the interaction between boron species and the cordierite support through BOSi and BOAl bonds.

3. Hydrogen bonding between surface OH groups on the cordierite and BOH groups from the boric acid precursor enhances adhesion of the catalyst layer.

This method appears particularly effective for ODHP, as it creates a catalyst with high activity, selectivity, and stability. However, its effectiveness for other catalytic applications would depend on the specific reaction requirements and whether the benefits of the monolithic structure (improved mass and heat transfer, high GHSV operation) are advantageous for those reactions.

The literature describes a hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) wash-coated cordierite monolithic catalyst for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP). This structure enhances catalytic performance through several key features:

1. Well-developed straight channels and thin h-BN layer: This structure optimizes mass transfer, especially at high gas hourly space velocity (GHSV), leading to improved propylene yield and selectivity.

2. 3-D dispersed active sites: The h-BN is uniformly dispersed over the cordierite support, providing accessible active sites throughout the catalyst structure.

3. Strong adhesion: The h-BN layer adheres well to the cordierite support without additional binders, improving mechanical stability.

The method used to incorporate B active components is chemical vapor deposition (CVD) using boric acid and urea as precursors. This method is effective because:

1. It creates a uniform, thin layer of h-BN on the cordierite surface.
2. It promotes strong interactions between the h-BN and the cordierite support through hydrogen bonding and the formation of B-O-Si and B-O-Al linkages.
3. It allows for control of the h-BN loading by adjusting precursor concentrations.

This approach is particularly effective for ODHP, as it creates a catalyst with high selectivity and productivity for propylene. The structure's ability to suppress deep oxidation reactions is especially valuable for this application. However, the effectiveness of this method for other catalytic applications would depend on the specific reaction requirements and whether the unique properties of h-BN (e.g., thermal stability, chemical inertness) are beneficial for the desired reaction.
