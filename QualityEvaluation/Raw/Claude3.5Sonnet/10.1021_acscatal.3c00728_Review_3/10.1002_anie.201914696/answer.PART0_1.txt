[1] "Using 11B solid-state NMR spectroscopy, we show that the majority of boron species in B-MWW exist as isolated BO3 units, fully incorporated into the zeolite framework."

[2] "B-MWW material showed no conversion above the background observed with a blank reactor (i.e. <0.5% conversion)."

[3] "The 11B isotropic chemical shift (δiso), electric field gradient asymmetry parameter (η) and quadrupolar coupling constant (CQ) values are characteristic of trigonal-planar boron species"

[4] "Based upon the analytical simulations, B(OSi)3 units make up ca. 90% of the boron incorporated into the framework. The peak with δiso(11B)=15ppm and ca. 10% integrated intensity is assigned to a B(OSi)2(OH) species consisting of two bonds to the framework and a terminal hydroxide."

[5] "All of these observations confirm the hypothesis that catalytically inactive B-MWW consist of predominately isolated boron sites incorporated into the zeolite framework, while the active ODH catalyst B/B-MWW contains some partially aggregated boron sites."

The study on B-MWW zeolite provides insights into B-based materials with 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks, but interestingly, it demonstrates that these structural characteristics do not enhance catalytic performance for oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of propane.

The B-MWW zeolite contains predominantly isolated BO3 units fully incorporated into the zeolite framework. About 90% of the boron exists as B(OSi)3 units, while the remaining 10% are B(OSi)2(OH) species. These boron sites are well-dispersed and isolated within the 3-D porous structure of the zeolite.

However, contrary to expectations, this highly dispersed and isolated nature of boron sites did not lead to enhanced catalytic performance. In fact, the B-MWW material showed no catalytic activity for ODH of propane above background levels.

The method used to incorporate B active components into the zeolite structure was hydrothermal synthesis, which resulted in isomorphous substitution of boron into the framework. This method was effective in creating a uniform distribution of isolated boron sites but proved ineffective for ODH catalysis.

The study critically evaluates this incorporation method by comparing B-MWW with B/B-MWW, where additional boron was impregnated onto B-MWW. The B/B-MWW catalyst, which contained some partially aggregated boron sites, showed catalytic activity similar to other active ODH catalysts.

This research suggests that for ODH catalysis, the effectiveness of boron incorporation methods depends on their ability to create partially aggregated boron sites rather than isolated sites. The study concludes that active boron-based ODH catalysts likely require boron species with some degree of B-O-B connectivity, challenging the hypothesis that isolated BO3 sites are active for this reaction.

These findings have important implications for the design of B-based catalysts for ODH applications, suggesting that methods promoting controlled aggregation of boron sites might be more effective than those creating highly dispersed, isolated sites.

B-MWW沸石的研究为多孔框架中具有三维分散活性位点的B基材料提供了见解，但有趣的是，这项研究表明，这些结构特征并不能增强丙烷氧化脱氢（ODH）的催化性能。

B-MWW沸石主要含有完全融入沸石框架的孤立BO3单元。大约90%的硼以B(OSi)3单元的形式存在，而剩余10%是B(OSi)2(OH)物种。这些硼位点在沸石的三维多孔结构中是分散和孤立的。

然而，与预期相反，硼位点的高度分散和孤立性并未导致催化性能的提高。事实上，B-MWW材料在丙烷ODH反应中显示的催化活性并未超过背景水平。

用于将B活性组分纳入沸石结构的方法是水热合成，这导致硼同质异形取代进入框架。这种方法有效地创造了孤立硼位点的均匀分布，但对ODH催化反应却证明是无效的。

该研究通过比较B-MWW和B/B-MWW（在B-MWW上额外浸渍硼）对这种掺入方法进行了批评性评估。含有部分聚集硼位点的B/B-MWW催化剂显示出与其他活性ODH催化剂相似的催化活性。

这项研究表明，对于ODH催化，硼掺入方法的有效性取决于它们创造部分聚集硼位点的能力，而不是孤立位点。研究得出结论，活性硼基ODH催化剂可能需要具有一定程度B-O-B连接的硼物种，这挑战了孤立BO3位点对该反应有活性的假设。

这些发现对ODH应用的B基催化剂设计具有重要意义，表明促进硼位点受控聚集的方法可能比创造高度分散、孤立位点的方法更有效。
