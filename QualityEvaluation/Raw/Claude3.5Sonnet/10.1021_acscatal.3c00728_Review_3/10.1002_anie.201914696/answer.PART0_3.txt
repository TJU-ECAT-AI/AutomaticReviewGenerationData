[1] "B-MWW was hydrothermally synthesized according to an established literature procedure (see Supporting Information)."

[2] "To investigate the source of ODH inactivity in B-MWW, we performed 1H and 11B MAS SSNMR spectroscopy experiments to directly probe the structure and distribution of boron atoms in the zeolite framework."

[3] "Analysis of the 1D D-RINEPT and 2D11B1H D-RINEPT spectra clearly illustrates that distinct 1H and 11B resonances can be observed depending on the duration of heteronuclear dipolar recoupling."

[4] "In summary, the 11B chemical shifts suggest that in B-MWW nearly all boron atoms are incorporated into the framework. The SSNMR data also suggests that these sites are well separated (>34Å apart) from one another, for the reasons given below."

[5] "Although B-MWW has a boron loading sufficient for catalytic activity, testing determined that it did not exhibit any ODH conversion of propane over background levels."

[6] "The difference in boron sites in B-MWW and these other boron materials leads us to the important conclusion that the boron-catalyzed ODH of propane does not proceed over an isolated BO3 site. Rather, active boron-based ODH catalysts likely requires boron species with some degree of B-O-B connectivity."

The structural characteristics of B-based materials with 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks, such as B-MWW zeolite, include the incorporation of boron atoms into the zeolite framework as isolated BO3 units. These boron sites are well-separated, typically more than 3-4 Å apart. However, contrary to expectations, these structural features do not enhance catalytic performance for oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of propane.

The primary method used to incorporate B active components into these structures is hydrothermal synthesis. This method is effective in creating isolated boron sites within the zeolite framework. However, the study shows that this approach is not effective for creating catalysts for propane ODH.

The effectiveness of this incorporation method was critically evaluated using advanced characterization techniques, particularly solid-state NMR spectroscopy. These techniques revealed that nearly all boron atoms were incorporated into the framework as isolated sites. However, catalytic testing showed that these isolated BO3 sites were inactive for propane ODH.

This finding challenges the assumption that isolated active sites are always beneficial for catalysis. In the case of boron-based ODH catalysts, the study suggests that some degree of B-O-B connectivity is required for catalytic activity, rather than isolated BO3 sites.

For ODH catalytic applications, the incorporation method used for B-MWW was found to be ineffective. The study suggests that methods allowing for some aggregation of boron sites or creation of B-O-B connectivity might be more suitable for developing active ODH catalysts.

In conclusion, while the hydrothermal synthesis method is effective for creating well-defined, isolated boron sites in zeolite frameworks, it may not be suitable for all catalytic applications. The study highlights the importance of understanding the specific structural requirements for different catalytic processes when designing and synthesizing catalysts.

具有3-D分散活性位点的B基材料在多孔框架中的结构特征，如B-MWW沸石，包括将硼原子作为孤立的BO3单元掺入沸石框架中。这些硼位点是分散的，通常相距3-4 Å以上。然而，与预期相反，这些结构特征并未增强丙烷氧化脱氢（ODH）的催化性能。

将B活性组分掺入这些结构的主要方法是水热合成。这种方法有效地在沸石框架内创建了孤立的硼位点。然而，研究表明，这种方法对于创建丙烷ODH催化剂并不有效。

使用先进的表征技术，特别是固态核磁共振波谱，对这种掺入方法的有效性进行了严格评估。这些技术揭示了几乎所有的硼原子都以孤立位点的形式掺入框架中。然而，催化测试表明，这些孤立的BO3位点对丙烷ODH无活性。

这一发现挑战了孤立活性位点总是有利于催化的假设。对于硼基ODH催化剂，研究表明需要一定程度的B-O-B连接性，而不是孤立的BO3位点。

对于ODH催化应用，用于B-MWW的掺入方法被发现是无效的。研究表明，允许硼位点聚集或创建B-O-B连接性的方法可能更适合开发活性ODH催化剂。

总之，虽然水热合成方法有效地在沸石框架中创建了明确定义的、孤立的硼位点，但它可能并不适用于所有催化应用。这项研究强调了在设计和合成催化剂时，理解不同催化过程的特定结构要求的重要性。
