[1] "Zeolites, microporous, crystalline materials composed of characteristic SiO4 tetrahedra, are among the most widely used industrial catalysts."

[2] "The so-called T-sites may be replaced with different atoms via isomorphous substitution to tune the catalytic properties by—for example—altering the Brønsted/Lewis acidity or creating a catalytic center."

[4] "Direct excitation 11B spin echo MAS SSNMR spectra of pristine B-MWW (fresh) and after 12 hours on stream (spent) were recorded at 11.7 T (ν0(1H) = 500 MHz) with a 10 kHz MAS frequency"

[5] "Based upon the analytical simulations, B(OSi)3 units make up ca. 90% of the boron incorporated into the framework. The peak with δiso(11B) = 15 ppm and ca. 10% integrated intensity is assigned to a B(OSi)2(OH) species consisting of two bonds to the framework and a terminal hydroxide."

[6] "Surprisingly, the B-MWW material showed no conversion above the background observed with a blank reactor (i.e. <0.5% conversion)."

[7] "The detailed characterization of B-MWW by multi-dimensional 1H and 11B SSNMR spectroscopy showed that boron exists predominantly as isolated B(OSi)3 units that are adjacent to a silanol group."

[8] "As was shown here and in our prior work, catalytically active B/B-MWW, B/SiO2, and boron nitride ODH catalysts contain aggregated boron sites that restructure under reaction conditions, whereas B-MWW is stable under reaction conditions and shows no restructuring of the boron atoms."

The literature primarily focuses on B-MWW, a boron-substituted zeolite with 3-D dispersed active sites in a porous framework. However, contrary to expectations, these structural characteristics did not enhance catalytic performance for the oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of propane.

B-MWW was synthesized using hydrothermal methods, which successfully incorporated boron into the zeolite framework. The majority (90%) of boron species exist as isolated B(OSi)3 units, with the remaining 10% as B(OSi)2(OH) species. This incorporation method resulted in well-dispersed, isolated boron sites within the zeolite structure.

Despite the successful incorporation of boron, B-MWW showed no catalytic activity for propane ODH. This surprising result contradicts the common assumption that isolated active sites in porous frameworks enhance catalytic performance. Instead, the study suggests that some degree of boron aggregation or B-O-B connectivity may be necessary for catalytic activity in ODH reactions.

The methods used to characterize the B-MWW structure, particularly solid-state NMR spectroscopy, were highly effective in elucidating the local environment of boron atoms and their distribution within the zeolite framework. These techniques provided valuable insights into the nature of boron incorporation and its stability under reaction conditions.

In contrast to B-MWW, other boron-based catalysts (B/B-MWW, B/SiO2, and boron nitride) that showed catalytic activity for ODH contained aggregated boron sites that could restructure under reaction conditions. This observation highlights the importance of the specific arrangement and interaction of boron sites for catalytic activity in ODH reactions.

Overall, while the incorporation of isolated boron sites into the MWW framework was successful, this study demonstrates that such isolated sites are not effective for propane ODH. The findings suggest that future research on boron-based ODH catalysts should focus on materials with some degree of boron aggregation or B-O-B connectivity, rather than isolated sites in porous frameworks.

这篇文献主要关注B-MWW，一种在多孔框架中具有三维分散活性位点的硼替代沸石。然而，与预期相反，这些结构特征并没有提高丙烷氧化脱氢（ODH）的催化性能。

B-MWW是通过水热方法合成的，成功地将硼掺入沸石框架。大多数（90%）的硼物种以孤立的B(OSi)3单元存在，其余10%为B(OSi)2(OH)物种。这种掺入方法在沸石结构中形成了分散良好的孤立硼位点。

尽管成功地掺入了硼，但B-MWW对丙烷ODH没有显示出催化活性。这一出人意料的结果与多孔框架中孤立活性位点可以提高催化性能的普遍假设相矛盾。相反，该研究表明，在ODH反应中可能需要某种程度的硼聚集或B-O-B连接才能产生催化活性。

用于表征B-MWW结构的方法，特别是固态核磁共振波谱法，在阐明硼原子的局部环境及其在沸石框架中的分布方面非常有效。这些技术为了解硼的掺入性质及其在反应条件下的稳定性提供了宝贵的见解。

与B-MWW不同，其他表现出ODH催化活性的硼基催化剂（B/B-MWW、B/SiO2和氮化硼）含有可在反应条件下重构的聚集硼位点。这一观察结果强调了硼位点的特定排列和相互作用对ODH反应催化活性的重要性。

总的来说，虽然将孤立的硼位点掺入MWW框架是成功的，但这项研究表明，这种孤立位点对丙烷ODH并不有效。研究结果表明，未来关于硼基ODH催化剂的研究应该关注具有一定程度硼聚集或B-O-B连接的材料，而不是多孔框架中的孤立位点。
