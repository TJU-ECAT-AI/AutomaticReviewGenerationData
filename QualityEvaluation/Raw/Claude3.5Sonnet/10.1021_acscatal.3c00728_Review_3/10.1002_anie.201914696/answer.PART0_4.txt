[1] "Solid-state NMR spectroscopy of hydrothermally synthesized B-MWW reveals that boron is fully incorporated into the zeolite framework as trivalent BO3 units. These isolated sites are inactive for oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of propane, which refutes the hypothesis that site-isolated boron species are the active site on boron-containing ODH catalysts."

[2] "Using 11B solid-state NMR spectroscopy, we show that the majority of boron species in B-MWW exist as isolated BO3 units, fully incorporated into the zeolite framework. However, this material shows no catalytic activity for ODH of propane to propene."

[3] "To investigate the source of ODH inactivity in B-MWW, we performed 1H and 11B MAS SSNMR spectroscopy experiments to directly probe the structure and distribution of boron atoms in the zeolite framework."

[4] "In summary, the 11B chemical shifts suggest that in B-MWW nearly all boron atoms are incorporated into the framework. The SSNMR data also suggests that these sites are well separated (>34Å apart) from one another, for the reasons given below."

[5] "All of these observations confirm the hypothesis that catalytically inactive B-MWW consist of predominately isolated boron sites incorporated into the zeolite framework, while the active ODH catalyst B/B-MWW contains some partially aggregated boron sites."

The structural characteristics of B-based materials with 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks, such as B-MWW zeolite, actually do not enhance catalytic performance for oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of propane. Contrary to expectations, the isolated boron sites in the zeolite framework are catalytically inactive for this reaction.

The main structural features of B-MWW include:
1. Boron is fully incorporated into the zeolite framework as trivalent BO3 units.
2. These boron sites are well-separated, with distances greater than 3-4 Å between them.
3. The majority of boron species exist as isolated B(OSi)3 units (about 90%), with a minor portion as B(OSi)2(OH) units (about 10%).

The method used to incorporate B active components into the B-MWW structure was hydrothermal synthesis. This method was effective in creating a uniform distribution of isolated boron sites within the zeolite framework. However, this structural characteristic, contrary to expectations, resulted in catalytic inactivity for propane ODH.

The study critically evaluates this method by comparing the catalytic performance of B-MWW with other boron-containing materials like B/B-MWW and B/SiO2. The results show that the isolated boron sites in B-MWW are not effective for propane ODH, while materials with partially aggregated boron sites (B/B-MWW) or those that can restructure under reaction conditions (B/SiO2) are catalytically active.

This research challenges the previous hypothesis that site-isolated boron species are the active sites in boron-containing ODH catalysts. Instead, it suggests that some degree of B-O-B connectivity or boron aggregation is necessary for catalytic activity in propane ODH reactions.

In conclusion, while the hydrothermal synthesis method was effective in creating well-dispersed, isolated boron sites in a porous framework, this structural characteristic did not enhance catalytic performance for propane ODH. The study emphasizes the importance of understanding the specific structural requirements for different catalytic applications, as isolated sites may not always be beneficial for all reactions.

含有三维分散活性位点的B基多孔框架材料（如B-MWW沸石）的结构特征实际上并不能提高丙烷氧化脱氢（ODH）反应的催化性能。与预期相反，沸石框架中的孤立硼位点对这种反应没有催化活性。

B-MWW的主要结构特征包括：
1. 硼完全以三价BO3单元的形式掺入沸石框架中。
2. 这些硼位点分布分散，相互之间的距离大于3-4 Å。
3. 大多数硼物种以孤立的B(OSi)3单元存在（约90%），少部分为B(OSi)2(OH)单元（约10%）。

将B活性组分掺入B-MWW结构的方法是水热合成。这种方法有效地在沸石框架内创造了均匀分布的孤立硼位点。然而，这种结构特征与预期相反，导致了丙烷ODH反应的催化失活。

该研究通过比较B-MWW与其他含硼材料（如B/B-MWW和B/SiO2）的催化性能，对这种方法进行了批评性评估。结果表明，B-MWW中的孤立硼位点对丙烷ODH不起作用，而具有部分聚集硼位点的材料（B/B-MWW）或在反应条件下可以重构的材料（B/SiO2）具有催化活性。

这项研究挑战了之前认为位点孤立的硼物种是含硼ODH催化剂活性位点的假设。相反，它表明在丙烷ODH反应中，某种程度的B-O-B连接或硼聚集是催化活性所必需的。

总之，虽然水热合成方法能够在多孔框架中有效地创造出分散良好的孤立硼位点，但这种结构特征并未增强丙烷ODH的催化性能。该研究强调了理解不同催化应用的具体结构要求的重要性，因为孤立位点可能并不总是对所有反应都有益。
