[1] "Solid-state NMR spectroscopy of hydrothermally synthesized B-MWW reveals that boron is fully incorporated into the zeolite framework as trivalent BO3 units. These isolated sites are inactive for oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of propane, which refutes the hypothesis that site-isolated boron species are the active site on boron-containing ODH catalysts."

[2] "Using 11B solid-state NMR spectroscopy, we show that the majority of boron species in B-MWW exist as isolated BO3 units, fully incorporated into the zeolite framework. However, this material shows no catalytic activity for ODH of propane to propene."

[3] "To understand the requirements for active site formation, the synthesis of a material with more controlled, uniform boron oxide speciation is necessary. Here, we focus on zeolite MCM-22 isomorphously substituted with boron (referred to as B-MWW)."

[4] "B-MWW was hydrothermally synthesized according to an established literature procedure (see Supporting Information)."

[5] "The lack of catalytic activity indicates that the boron species in the zeolite framework are surprisingly not active for propane ODH."

[6] "As discussed in detail below, the B-MWW is likely an inactive ODH catalyst because it contains very stable and isolated framework species."

The literature discusses B-MWW, a zeolite material with boron incorporated into its framework, as an example of a B-based material with 3-D dispersed active sites in a porous framework. However, contrary to enhancing catalytic performance, this structural characteristic actually renders the material inactive for oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of propane.

The main structural features of B-MWW include:
1. Boron is fully incorporated into the zeolite framework as trivalent BO3 units.
2. These boron sites are isolated within the framework.
3. The majority of boron species exist as isolated BO3 units.

The method used to incorporate boron into the structure is hydrothermal synthesis, following an established literature procedure. This method effectively creates isolated boron sites within the zeolite framework.

However, the study reveals that this incorporation method and resulting structure are not effective for ODH catalysis. The isolated nature of the boron sites, which was initially thought to be potentially beneficial, actually renders the material catalytically inactive for propane ODH.

This finding challenges previous assumptions about the nature of active sites in boron-based ODH catalysts. It suggests that isolated BO3 units are not the active sites for this reaction, and that some degree of boron aggregation or B-O-B connectivity may be necessary for catalytic activity.

The study demonstrates that while the hydrothermal synthesis method is effective for creating isolated boron sites in a zeolite framework, this structural characteristic is not beneficial for all catalytic applications, particularly propane ODH. This highlights the importance of tailoring the synthesis method and resulting structure to the specific catalytic application intended.

这篇文献讨论了B-MWW，一种在多孔框架中具有三维分散活性位点的含硼材料。然而，与增强催化性能相反，这种结构特征实际上使该材料在丙烷的氧化脱氢（ODH）反应中不活跃。

B-MWW的主要结构特征包括：
1. 硼完全以三价BO3单元的形式掺入沸石框架中。
2. 这些硼位点在框架内是孤立的。
3. 大多数硼物种以孤立的BO3单元存在。

将硼掺入结构的方法是水热合成，遵循已建立的文献程序。这种方法有效地在沸石框架内创建了孤立的硼位点。

然而，研究表明，这种掺入方法和由此产生的结构对ODH催化并不有效。硼位点的孤立性，原本被认为可能是有益的，实际上使得该材料在丙烷ODH反应中催化不活性。

这一发现挑战了先前关于硼基ODH催化剂活性位点性质的假设。它表明，孤立的BO3单元不是这种反应的活性位点，而某种程度的硼聚集或B-O-B连接可能对催化活性是必要的。

这项研究表明，虽然水热合成方法有效地在沸石框架中创建了孤立的硼位点，但这种结构特征并不适用于所有的催化应用，特别是丙烷ODH。这突出了根据特定催化应用来调整合成方法和结构的重要性。

The study on B-MWW zeolite provides insights into B-based materials with 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks, but interestingly, it demonstrates that these structural characteristics do not enhance catalytic performance for oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of propane.

The B-MWW zeolite contains predominantly isolated BO3 units fully incorporated into the zeolite framework. About 90% of the boron exists as B(OSi)3 units, while the remaining 10% are B(OSi)2(OH) species. These boron sites are well-dispersed and isolated within the 3-D porous structure of the zeolite.

However, contrary to expectations, this highly dispersed and isolated nature of boron sites did not lead to enhanced catalytic performance. In fact, the B-MWW material showed no catalytic activity for ODH of propane above background levels.

The method used to incorporate B active components into the zeolite structure was hydrothermal synthesis, which resulted in isomorphous substitution of boron into the framework. This method was effective in creating a uniform distribution of isolated boron sites but proved ineffective for ODH catalysis.

The study critically evaluates this incorporation method by comparing B-MWW with B/B-MWW, where additional boron was impregnated onto B-MWW. The B/B-MWW catalyst, which contained some partially aggregated boron sites, showed catalytic activity similar to other active ODH catalysts.

This research suggests that for ODH catalysis, the effectiveness of boron incorporation methods depends on their ability to create partially aggregated boron sites rather than isolated sites. The study concludes that active boron-based ODH catalysts likely require boron species with some degree of B-O-B connectivity, challenging the hypothesis that isolated BO3 sites are active for this reaction.

These findings have important implications for the design of B-based catalysts for ODH applications, suggesting that methods promoting controlled aggregation of boron sites might be more effective than those creating highly dispersed, isolated sites.

B-MWW沸石的研究为多孔框架中具有三维分散活性位点的B基材料提供了见解，但有趣的是，这项研究表明，这些结构特征并不能增强丙烷氧化脱氢（ODH）的催化性能。

B-MWW沸石主要含有完全融入沸石框架的孤立BO3单元。大约90%的硼以B(OSi)3单元的形式存在，而剩余10%是B(OSi)2(OH)物种。这些硼位点在沸石的三维多孔结构中是分散和孤立的。

然而，与预期相反，硼位点的高度分散和孤立性并未导致催化性能的提高。事实上，B-MWW材料在丙烷ODH反应中显示的催化活性并未超过背景水平。

用于将B活性组分纳入沸石结构的方法是水热合成，这导致硼同质异形取代进入框架。这种方法有效地创造了孤立硼位点的均匀分布，但对ODH催化反应却证明是无效的。

该研究通过比较B-MWW和B/B-MWW（在B-MWW上额外浸渍硼）对这种掺入方法进行了批评性评估。含有部分聚集硼位点的B/B-MWW催化剂显示出与其他活性ODH催化剂相似的催化活性。

这项研究表明，对于ODH催化，硼掺入方法的有效性取决于它们创造部分聚集硼位点的能力，而不是孤立位点。研究得出结论，活性硼基ODH催化剂可能需要具有一定程度B-O-B连接的硼物种，这挑战了孤立BO3位点对该反应有活性的假设。

这些发现对ODH应用的B基催化剂设计具有重要意义，表明促进硼位点受控聚集的方法可能比创造高度分散、孤立位点的方法更有效。

[8] "As was shown here and in our prior work, catalytically active B/B-MWW, B/SiO2, and boron nitride ODH catalysts contain aggregated boron sites that restructure under reaction conditions, whereas B-MWW is stable under reaction conditions and shows no restructuring of the boron atoms."

The literature primarily focuses on B-MWW, a boron-substituted zeolite with 3-D dispersed active sites in a porous framework. However, contrary to expectations, these structural characteristics did not enhance catalytic performance for the oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of propane.

B-MWW was synthesized using hydrothermal methods, which successfully incorporated boron into the zeolite framework. The majority (90%) of boron species exist as isolated B(OSi)3 units, with the remaining 10% as B(OSi)2(OH) species. This incorporation method resulted in well-dispersed, isolated boron sites within the zeolite structure.

Despite the successful incorporation of boron, B-MWW showed no catalytic activity for propane ODH. This surprising result contradicts the common assumption that isolated active sites in porous frameworks enhance catalytic performance. Instead, the study suggests that some degree of boron aggregation or B-O-B connectivity may be necessary for catalytic activity in ODH reactions.

The methods used to characterize the B-MWW structure, particularly solid-state NMR spectroscopy, were highly effective in elucidating the local environment of boron atoms and their distribution within the zeolite framework. These techniques provided valuable insights into the nature of boron incorporation and its stability under reaction conditions.

In contrast to B-MWW, other boron-based catalysts (B/B-MWW, B/SiO2, and boron nitride) that showed catalytic activity for ODH contained aggregated boron sites that could restructure under reaction conditions. This observation highlights the importance of the specific arrangement and interaction of boron sites for catalytic activity in ODH reactions.

Overall, while the incorporation of isolated boron sites into the MWW framework was successful, this study demonstrates that such isolated sites are not effective for propane ODH. The findings suggest that future research on boron-based ODH catalysts should focus on materials with some degree of boron aggregation or B-O-B connectivity, rather than isolated sites in porous frameworks.

这篇文献主要关注B-MWW，一种在多孔框架中具有三维分散活性位点的硼替代沸石。然而，与预期相反，这些结构特征并没有提高丙烷氧化脱氢（ODH）的催化性能。

B-MWW是通过水热方法合成的，成功地将硼掺入沸石框架。大多数（90%）的硼物种以孤立的B(OSi)3单元存在，其余10%为B(OSi)2(OH)物种。这种掺入方法在沸石结构中形成了分散良好的孤立硼位点。

尽管成功地掺入了硼，但B-MWW对丙烷ODH没有显示出催化活性。这一出人意料的结果与多孔框架中孤立活性位点可以提高催化性能的普遍假设相矛盾。相反，该研究表明，在ODH反应中可能需要某种程度的硼聚集或B-O-B连接才能产生催化活性。

用于表征B-MWW结构的方法，特别是固态核磁共振波谱法，在阐明硼原子的局部环境及其在沸石框架中的分布方面非常有效。这些技术为了解硼的掺入性质及其在反应条件下的稳定性提供了宝贵的见解。

与B-MWW不同，其他表现出ODH催化活性的硼基催化剂（B/B-MWW、B/SiO2和氮化硼）含有可在反应条件下重构的聚集硼位点。这一观察结果强调了硼位点的特定排列和相互作用对ODH反应催化活性的重要性。

总的来说，虽然将孤立的硼位点掺入MWW框架是成功的，但这项研究表明，这种孤立位点对丙烷ODH并不有效。研究结果表明，未来关于硼基ODH催化剂的研究应该关注具有一定程度硼聚集或B-O-B连接的材料，而不是多孔框架中的孤立位点。

[6] "The difference in boron sites in B-MWW and these other boron materials leads us to the important conclusion that the boron-catalyzed ODH of propane does not proceed over an isolated BO3 site. Rather, active boron-based ODH catalysts likely requires boron species with some degree of B-O-B connectivity."

The structural characteristics of B-based materials with 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks, such as B-MWW zeolite, include the incorporation of boron atoms into the zeolite framework as isolated BO3 units. These boron sites are well-separated, typically more than 3-4 Å apart. However, contrary to expectations, these structural features do not enhance catalytic performance for oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of propane.

The primary method used to incorporate B active components into these structures is hydrothermal synthesis. This method is effective in creating isolated boron sites within the zeolite framework. However, the study shows that this approach is not effective for creating catalysts for propane ODH.

The effectiveness of this incorporation method was critically evaluated using advanced characterization techniques, particularly solid-state NMR spectroscopy. These techniques revealed that nearly all boron atoms were incorporated into the framework as isolated sites. However, catalytic testing showed that these isolated BO3 sites were inactive for propane ODH.

This finding challenges the assumption that isolated active sites are always beneficial for catalysis. In the case of boron-based ODH catalysts, the study suggests that some degree of B-O-B connectivity is required for catalytic activity, rather than isolated BO3 sites.

For ODH catalytic applications, the incorporation method used for B-MWW was found to be ineffective. The study suggests that methods allowing for some aggregation of boron sites or creation of B-O-B connectivity might be more suitable for developing active ODH catalysts.

In conclusion, while the hydrothermal synthesis method is effective for creating well-defined, isolated boron sites in zeolite frameworks, it may not be suitable for all catalytic applications. The study highlights the importance of understanding the specific structural requirements for different catalytic processes when designing and synthesizing catalysts.

具有3-D分散活性位点的B基材料在多孔框架中的结构特征，如B-MWW沸石，包括将硼原子作为孤立的BO3单元掺入沸石框架中。这些硼位点是分散的，通常相距3-4 Å以上。然而，与预期相反，这些结构特征并未增强丙烷氧化脱氢（ODH）的催化性能。

将B活性组分掺入这些结构的主要方法是水热合成。这种方法有效地在沸石框架内创建了孤立的硼位点。然而，研究表明，这种方法对于创建丙烷ODH催化剂并不有效。

使用先进的表征技术，特别是固态核磁共振波谱，对这种掺入方法的有效性进行了严格评估。这些技术揭示了几乎所有的硼原子都以孤立位点的形式掺入框架中。然而，催化测试表明，这些孤立的BO3位点对丙烷ODH无活性。

这一发现挑战了孤立活性位点总是有利于催化的假设。对于硼基ODH催化剂，研究表明需要一定程度的B-O-B连接性，而不是孤立的BO3位点。

对于ODH催化应用，用于B-MWW的掺入方法被发现是无效的。研究表明，允许硼位点聚集或创建B-O-B连接性的方法可能更适合开发活性ODH催化剂。

总之，虽然水热合成方法有效地在沸石框架中创建了明确定义的、孤立的硼位点，但它可能并不适用于所有催化应用。这项研究强调了在设计和合成催化剂时，理解不同催化过程的特定结构要求的重要性。
