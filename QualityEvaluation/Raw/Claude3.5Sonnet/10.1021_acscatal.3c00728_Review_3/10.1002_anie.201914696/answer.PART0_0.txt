[1] "Solid-state NMR spectroscopy of hydrothermally synthesized B-MWW reveals that boron is fully incorporated into the zeolite framework as trivalent BO3 units. These isolated sites are inactive for oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of propane, which refutes the hypothesis that site-isolated boron species are the active site on boron-containing ODH catalysts."

[2] "Using 11B solid-state NMR spectroscopy, we show that the majority of boron species in B-MWW exist as isolated BO3 units, fully incorporated into the zeolite framework. However, this material shows no catalytic activity for ODH of propane to propene."

[3] "To understand the requirements for active site formation, the synthesis of a material with more controlled, uniform boron oxide speciation is necessary. Here, we focus on zeolite MCM-22 isomorphously substituted with boron (referred to as B-MWW)."

[4] "B-MWW was hydrothermally synthesized according to an established literature procedure (see Supporting Information)."

[5] "The lack of catalytic activity indicates that the boron species in the zeolite framework are surprisingly not active for propane ODH."

[6] "As discussed in detail below, the B-MWW is likely an inactive ODH catalyst because it contains very stable and isolated framework species."

The literature discusses B-MWW, a zeolite material with boron incorporated into its framework, as an example of a B-based material with 3-D dispersed active sites in a porous framework. However, contrary to enhancing catalytic performance, this structural characteristic actually renders the material inactive for oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of propane.

The main structural features of B-MWW include:
1. Boron is fully incorporated into the zeolite framework as trivalent BO3 units.
2. These boron sites are isolated within the framework.
3. The majority of boron species exist as isolated BO3 units.

The method used to incorporate boron into the structure is hydrothermal synthesis, following an established literature procedure. This method effectively creates isolated boron sites within the zeolite framework.

However, the study reveals that this incorporation method and resulting structure are not effective for ODH catalysis. The isolated nature of the boron sites, which was initially thought to be potentially beneficial, actually renders the material catalytically inactive for propane ODH.

This finding challenges previous assumptions about the nature of active sites in boron-based ODH catalysts. It suggests that isolated BO3 units are not the active sites for this reaction, and that some degree of boron aggregation or B-O-B connectivity may be necessary for catalytic activity.

The study demonstrates that while the hydrothermal synthesis method is effective for creating isolated boron sites in a zeolite framework, this structural characteristic is not beneficial for all catalytic applications, particularly propane ODH. This highlights the importance of tailoring the synthesis method and resulting structure to the specific catalytic application intended.

这篇文献讨论了B-MWW，一种在多孔框架中具有三维分散活性位点的含硼材料。然而，与增强催化性能相反，这种结构特征实际上使该材料在丙烷的氧化脱氢（ODH）反应中不活跃。

B-MWW的主要结构特征包括：
1. 硼完全以三价BO3单元的形式掺入沸石框架中。
2. 这些硼位点在框架内是孤立的。
3. 大多数硼物种以孤立的BO3单元存在。

将硼掺入结构的方法是水热合成，遵循已建立的文献程序。这种方法有效地在沸石框架内创建了孤立的硼位点。

然而，研究表明，这种掺入方法和由此产生的结构对ODH催化并不有效。硼位点的孤立性，原本被认为可能是有益的，实际上使得该材料在丙烷ODH反应中催化不活性。

这一发现挑战了先前关于硼基ODH催化剂活性位点性质的假设。它表明，孤立的BO3单元不是这种反应的活性位点，而某种程度的硼聚集或B-O-B连接可能对催化活性是必要的。

这项研究表明，虽然水热合成方法有效地在沸石框架中创建了孤立的硼位点，但这种结构特征并不适用于所有的催化应用，特别是丙烷ODH。这突出了根据特定催化应用来调整合成方法和结构的重要性。
