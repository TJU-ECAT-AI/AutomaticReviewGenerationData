Plasma Tuning Local Environment of Hexagonal Boron Nitride for Oxidative Dehydrogenation of Propane
Graphical Abstract
Plasma (N2, O2, H2, Ar) regulated h-BN with distinct local environment were obtained and employed for ODH of propane: N2 treated BN containing more three-boron center nitrogen-defects exhibited remarkable propane conversion of 26.0% with olefin selectivity of 89.4% at 520C. O2 treated BN showed deactivation due to the sintering effect of BOx. N-H and B-H generated during H2 treatment, may be unable to facilitate the reaction activity.
Abstract
Hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) has lately received great attention in the oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) reaction of propane to propylene for its extraordinary olefin selectivity in contrast to metal oxides. However, high crystallinity of commercial h-BN and elusive cognition of active sites hindered the enhancement of utilization efficiency. Herein, four kinds of plasmas (N2, O2, H2, Ar) were accordingly employed to regulate the local chemical environment of h-BN. N2-treated BN exhibited a remarkable activity, i.e., 26.0% propane conversion with 89.4% selectivity toward olefins at 520C. Spectroscopy demonstrated that three-boron center N-defects in the catalyst played a pivotal role in facilitating the conversion of propane. While the sintering effect of the BOx species in O2-treated BN, led to the suppressed catalytic performance (12.4% conversion at 520C).
Propylene is one of the most essential molecules in modern chemical industry, which has an extensive downstream product chain such as polypropylene, acrylonitrile, and acetone. Due to the transformation of the traditional steam cracking and catalytic cracking (FCC) limits the production space of propylene, and with the large-scale exploitation of shale gas, there is an urgent need to develop the route of propylene production from propane.1 Featured by exothermicity, free of thermodynamic equilibrium limitation, and no coking, oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of propane becomes an attractive competitor in contrast to direct dehydrogenation (DH).2 Unfortunately, a challenging problem arisen in the ODH reaction is that electrophilic oxygen species on the surface of metal oxides can cause the deep-oxidation of electron-rich olefins to COx, running counter to the principles of the atomic economy.3 Recently, the discovery that hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) selectively oxidized propane to propylene with only negligible CO2 formation broke through the restriction of this process.4 With the investigation of various boron-containing catalysts in different alkane atmospheres, it has been generally accepted that the oxygen-containing boron species on the surface of the catalyst is the catalytic origin of the ODH reaction.5 At present, since the high crystallinity of commercial h-BN leads to a limited amount of active sites, it is necessary to effectively improve the reaction performance of this material to boost industrialization. Although the high surface area h-BN and boron-rich materials have been applied to the ODH reaction,6 simplifying the synthesis steps remains an ongoing challenge.
Rational etching and chemical modifications on the surface of catalysts are critical for improving activity and understanding the reaction mechanism. Up to now, various up-to-bottom strategies have been explored to functionalize h-BN such as sonication,7 ball milling,8 hydrothermal reactions,9 and plasma treatment,10 which avoid complicated steps of bottom-to-up synthesis.11 Among them, plasma technology renders an attractive advantage depending on low energy consumption and pollution-emission. As a simple method, plasma has been widely studied in the modification of electrocatalyst,12 while that on h-BN is mainly focused on improving hydrophilic and conductivity.
High energy species (radicals, ions, and electrons) in plasma are capable of modifying surface property and composition of catalytic materials through breaking surface chemical bonds and reacting with surface atoms to form new chemical bonds. In this study, we have chosen four kinds of plasmas (e.g. N2,13 O2,14 H2,15 and Ar16 plasmas) to treat ball-milled BN (Note: in the following context, we use h-BN and BN to accordingly indicate the commercial and ball-milled boron nitride, respectively) thus to selectively construct boron sites with different local environments and investigated the relationship between structure and catalytic activity.
The ODH activity of different plasma-treated BN under identical reaction conditions was shown in Figure1a, together with BN as a reference sample. The outcome indicated that N2-BN displayed the best performance, of which propane conversion of 26.0% and selectivity of 76.7% toward propylene or 89.4% for all olefins were achieved at 520C. In addition, it also exhibited higher olefin productivity of 1.99golefingcat1h1 compared with the previously reported results of h-BN (0.50golefingcat1h1).4a The propane conversion of Ar-BN was similar to BN with 17.5% while that of H2-BN with a slightly reduced value of 14.4%. Propane conversion decreased from 17.0% of BN to 12.4% of O2-BN, demonstrating the negative effect of the O2 plasma. Figure1b showed the ODH catalytic performance of catalysts as a function of reaction temperature (480520C). Possibly due to some active sites were introduced during O2 plasma treatment, at relatively lower reaction temperatures of 480490C, O2-BN exhibited the highest propane conversion among all catalysts. As the temperature further increased, O2-BN performed the worst. Interestingly, O2-BN after water washing (O2-BN-wash) presented a comparable activity to N2-BN (FigureS1), indicating some undesirable effects were able to be eliminated by water washing.

The different catalytic activity ascribed to plasma impelled us to further investigate the structure of the catalysts. The XRD pattern (Figure2a) showed that several diffraction peaks at 2θ=26.8, 41.5, and 43.9 were observed in all materials, corresponding to the (002), (100), and (101) crystal plane of h-BN. There was no significant difference between BN and plasma-treated BN in XRD results except for O2-BN because plasma was insufficient to break the bulk phase of h-BN. However, three new diffraction peaks at 2θ=14.6 and 27.8, and 37.7 appeared in the O2-BN pattern, proving that O2 plasma treatment introduced a considerable amount of new species to h-BN. TGA showed that the oxidation temperature of BN in air was higher than 900C (FigureS2), while O2 plasma could significantly decrease the oxidation temperature of BN. O2-BN possessed the lowest area of 39m2g1 (Figure2b, TableS1), indicating that the new species might sinter BN nanosheets. This phenomenon was more clearly observed by a scanning electron microscope (SEM) (Figure2ce, FigureS3). In O2-BN, cotton-like and fibrous species gather the two-dimensional sheet-layer boron nitride into a block. SEM, XRD, and N2 adsorption-desorption isotherms of O2-BN-wash (FiguresS4-S5) showed that the specific surface area returned to 103m2g1 with the disappearance of the new species, finding clear support for the explanation that the species leached away by water washing could sinter BN nanosheets. The washed filtrate was dried, and white solids were obtained, which were determined to be the mixture of boric acid and amorphous boron oxide (FigureS6). To clarify the role of specific surface area, a series of activity tests with different O2-BN loads and temperatures were carried out (FigureS7). Possibly due to gas phase chain reaction termination events, propane conversion showed a volcano-type dependence on the loading and reached a maximum at 150mg.17 However, the low specific surface area of O2-BN was an important factor to cause its low activity because given 100mg catalysts (less than 150mg) were used for the comparison of activity. Besides, peaks belong at 2θ=14.6, 27.8 and 37.7 were distinctly observed on spent catalysts (FigureS8), indicating that the new species were also generated during the ODH reaction.

The FT-IR spectra of catalysts were given in Figure3a. Prior to the treatment of plasma, the spectrum of BN exhibited the characteristic in-plane B-N transverse stretching vibration at 1385cm1 and out-of-plane bending vibration at 803cm1, respectively.18 The peak of O-H at 3384cm1 was caused by introducing elements H and O during ball-milling since the peak of O-H at 3384cm1 was not found in h-BN (FigureS9). After the treatment of plasma, the peak for O-H disappeared in N2-BN and Ar-BN, while a new peak at 3201cm1 was found in H2-BN, which was assigned to the N-H vibration.8a One to note, the peaks at 2517cm1 and 2300cm1 in H2-BN corresponded to the stretching vibration of B-H,5e, 19 confirming the feasible chemical reaction between H2 plasma and h-BN. The spectra of all spent catalysts apparently exhibited peaks belonging to O-H vibration (Figure3b), illustrating boron sites were hydroxylated during the ODH reaction. Interestingly, peaks ascribed to the N-H and B-H vibration were also found after the ODH reaction. But through judging from the catalytic performance of H2-BN, these two functional groups were unable to facilitate the reaction activity. UV/Vis DRS showed two absorption lines located at 205nm and 218nm for h-BN (Figure3c), whereas a new absorption line at 273nm was found for BN. This may be caused by defects generated during ball-milling, which could introduce additional states and alter the optical properties, leading to a low optical band gap (FigureS10).20 N2-BN exhibited the band gap of 2.6eV, lower than that of other catalysts, proving that N2 plasma could induce more defects in BN.21 On the contrary, influenced by new species, O2-BN exhibited a wider band gap than BN, and the wider band got narrower after washing (O2-BN-wash: 2.7eV, FigureS11). As shown in Figure3d, two typical N-defect signals, whose structural models were shown in FigureS12, i.e., g1 and g2, at g=2.004 were observed on the EPR spectrum of BN, corresponding to three-boron center (TBC) and one-boron center (OBC), respectively.22 Except for H2-BN, the signal intensity of other catalysts after plasma treatment increased, indicating that more radicals were generated. Each plasma atmosphere may lead to different kinds of radicals. In particular, due to abundant unpaired electrons of O atoms in isolated conjugated OB structures formed under the O2 plasma atmosphere, the signal intensity of O2-BN was much greater than that of other catalysts.23 As expected, the concentration of unpaired electrons in O2-BN-wash dropped significantly in contrast to O2-BN (FigureS13). Furthermore, possibly due to the combination between a hydrogen atom and isolated conjugated OB during the ODH reaction, the EPR signal of O2-BN-spent was almost undetectable (FigureS14). Interestingly, as shown in Figure3e, there was a positive correlation between reaction rates and g1 intensity, which meant that g1 defect played a leading role in the ODH reaction compared with g2. This may support the previous report that aggregated boron was in favor to become active sites.5g Raman spectra showed that only one peak was detected at 1363.6cm1 of BN (Figure3f), representing the high-frequency interlayer E2g vibration mode. The peak position in N2-BN was blue-shifted (4.0cm1) relative to that of BN, with the obvious expansion of the full width at half-maximum (BN: 12.3cm1 N2-BN: 14.8cm1). These changes were ascribed to in-plane strain strengthening and interlayer interaction weakening, which evidenced that N2 plasma could create more N-defects.24 Other catalysts showed a similar trend while the changes were smaller than N2-BN.

The mass of each catalyst for the EPR measurement was 100mg.
To further investigate the influence of different plasma on h-BN, the surface chemical properties of three typical samples were analyzed by using XPS measurement. The result (TableS2) evidenced the increase of B/N ratio on the surface after the plasma treatment from 1.28 in BN up to 1.32 in N2-BN and O2-BN, indicating that the loss of nitrogen was greater than that of boron. This transformation demonstrated that more N-defects sites were obtained, possibly due to nitrogen was more likely to leave the surface of h-BN and form low-boiling products such as N2, NOx through reacting with active species produced in plasma. The species were detected by OES (FiguresS15,S16). The concentrations of oxygen increased to 8.3% in O2-BN, illustrating that O2 plasma functionalized h-BN during treatment and remained on the surface in the form of oxygen-containing compounds. The spectra of B 1s were deconvoluted into two species in BN and N2-BN: the main peak at 190.4eV was boron atom bonded with nitrogen on a flat surface, and the subpeak at 191.4eV was assigned to B-O (Figure4a).22 It was noticeable, however, a new peak in O2-BN at 192.6eV was found assigned to BOx,25 proving that an oxygen-containing boron species on the h-BN surface could be introduced during O2 plasma treatment, which was consistent with XRD. As expected, due to the generation of the new species during the ODH reaction, the oxygen content increased in all spent catalysts. Moreover, the blueshift for N-B and O-B evidenced that part of nitrogen atom was replaced by O atom with higher electronegativity (Figure4b; FigureS17). The B 1s spectra showed that the ratio of B-O raised and the peak of BOx appeared in BN-spent and N2-BN-spent. N2-BN-spent contained the most oxygen-containing boron species, corresponding to the best ODH activity. This phenomenon indicated that the generation of active sites preferentially occurred at the boron terminal with N-defects, experimentally supporting the previous theoretical calculations.26 Furthermore, it was certain that B2O3 was not detected on XPS whose binding energy was generally considered to be higher than 193eV. The concentration of oxygen only slightly increased on the surface of O2-BN-spent, indicating that the oxygen-containing boron species on O2-BN was more saturated than the other two catalysts before the ODH reaction. The low activity of O2-BN was due to the sinter of BN nanosheets caused by the BOx species, reducing the utilization of active B sites, despite it possessed higher oxygen concentration and the same B/N ratio as N2-BN. As shown in TableS3 and FigureS18, in the case of sample O2-BN-wash, the peak corresponding to BOx disappeared after washing. The B/N ratio of O2-BN-wash and N2-BN is quite similar, accordingly 1.31 and 1.32. Moreover, O2-BN-wash-spent generated oxygen-containing boron species with similar content (B-O: 18.2% BOx: 9.8%) to N2-BN-spent (B-O: 20.9%, BOx: 9.2%). These results demonstrated that the two samples exhibited similar catalytic conversion, i.e., 27.3% for O2-BN-wash and 26.0% for N2-BN, under the same reaction conditions. The surface areas of H2-BN and Ar-BN decreased as compared to the parent BN. Although the B/N ratio slightly increased from 1.28 of BN to 1.29 of H2-BN and Ar-BN (TableS4), the low activity of H2-BN may be attributed to the suppression of B-H species, and the unchanged activity of Ar-BN may result from the compromised effect between the increased B/N ratio and decreased specific surface area. Furthermore, the N-H peak was found in the N 1s spectrum of H2-BN, also indicating the hydrogenation reaction of BN under H2 plasma atmosphere. Also, the peak at 399.6eV attributed to N-H was found in spent catalysts and H2-BN (FigureS19), which was consistent with the results of IR. The above results suggested the enhanced reactivity was closely related to the increased N-defects. To deeply elucidate the characteristics of oxygen-containing boron species, the acidity of fresh and spent catalysts was investigated by the mean of NH3-TPD for the first time (Figure5; TableS5). The profiles of NH3 desorption during TPD indicated the presence of one acid site in BN and N2-BN, denominated weak acid, whose desorption temperature was 178C (B-O). For O2-BN, the amount of acid increased, and a new strong acid site with a NH3 desorption temperature of 240C was introduced. Similarly, the strong acid site was also generated in BN-spent and N2-BN-spent. According to the XPS results, this site was assigned to BOx. To probe the difference of acidity between this species and B2O3, 10wt% B2O3/ h-BN was synthesized through physical grinding. The results of NH3-TPD showed that only a desorption peak at 184C was detected (FigureS20), and the spent catalyst showed a broad desorption peak covering a wide temperature range was observed. It indicated that the new oxygen-containing boron species were formed, which could be assigned to BOx according to the similar NH3 desorption temperature of the plasma-treated BN after the ODH reactions.

The generation of N-defects and its evolution into BOx during the ODH reaction of propane were proposed and shown in Figure6. Two types of N-defects (TBC and OBC) were generated during plasma treatment while TBC possibly preferred to become active BOx species under the ODH atmosphere and further converted propane to propylene.

In summary, we have prepared a series of BN catalysts with different B sites via N2, O2, H2, and Ar plasma treatments. N2-BN exhibited a remarkable ODH reaction performance (26.0% propane conversion and 89.4% olefins selectivity), while O2-BN showed the undesirable activity with the conversion of 12.4% of propane. Because N2 plasma could break chemical bonds linked in a controlled manner and abstract N element on the surface of BN, more three-boron center N-defects were formed, which were considered to be favorable sites for generating active species. Moreover, existing competition between sintering effect and catalytic activity of BOx formed by O2 plasma. From the performance of H2-BN, although N-H and B-H were generated during the ODH reaction, they may not promote propane conversion. As an efficient up-to-down synthesis method, plasma technology not only provides a feasible way for the design of functionalized or defects-rich catalysts but also deepens the comprehension of active sites.
