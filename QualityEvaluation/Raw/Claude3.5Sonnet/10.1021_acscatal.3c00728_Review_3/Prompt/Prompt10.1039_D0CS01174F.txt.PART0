Oxidative dehydrogenation of light alkanes to olefins on metal-free catalysts
Metal-free boron- and carbon-based catalysts have shown both great fundamental and practical value in oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of light alkanes. In particular, boron-based catalysts show a superior selectivity toward olefins, excellent stability and atom-economy to valuable carbon-based products by minimizing CO2 emission, which are highly promising in future industrialization. The carbonaceous catalysts also exhibited impressive behavior in the ODH of light alkanes helped along by surface oxygen-containing functional groups. This review surveyed and compared the preparation methods of the boron- and carbon-based catalysts and their characterization, their performance in the ODH of light alkanes, and the mechanistic issues of the ODH including the identification of the possible active sites and the exploration of the underlying mechanisms. We discussed different boron-based materials and established versatile methodologies for the investigation of active sites and reaction mechanisms. We also elaborated on the similarities and differences in catalytic and kinetic behaviors, and reaction mechanisms between boron- and carbon-based metal-free materials. A perspective of the potential issues of metal-free ODH catalytic systems in terms of their rational design and their synergy with reactor engineering was sketched.

1 Introduction
The chemical industry has been making a great contribution to the agriculture, transportation and construction industries. The development of the chemical industry strongly relies on catalysis, which is involved in more than 80% of industrial processes. The synthesis of polymers, e.g. polyethylene and polypropylene, is one of the key components of the chemical industry, and mainly takes light olefins, including ethylene, propylene and butylene, as feedstocks. In 2019 the ever-growing worldwide consumption of ethylene and propylene soared to approximately 160 and 115 million tons, respectively (Fig. 1a).1 These light olefins are mainly produced from petroleum-derived steam cracking, fluid catalytic cracking (FCC), methanol to olefins (MTO) and FischerTropsch to olefins (FTO).2,3 These technologies in general feature high energy consumption and enormous carbon emission, and contradict sustainable development criteria that have strict requirements on environmental protection and energy-consumption. This raises challenges both scientifically and technologically, and drives a shift of chemical engineering from energy-demanding chemical processes to more environmentally friendly protocols of catalysis to produce olefins with high atom economy, low energy consumption and low emission.

In recent years, the rich availability and low-cost of worldwide natural gas and shale gas production (Fig. 1b) have motivated the development of industrial techniques towards the gas-based dehydrogenation routes to obtain light olefins. In 2018, the proved reserves of natural gas reached 197 trillion cubic meters. These gas resources are composed of considerable amounts of light alkanes, e.g. methane, ethane, and propane, which can be separated from the natural gas,4 and have been mainly used as fuel rather than chemical feedstocks in the past few decades owing to their relatively inert chemical properties compared to olefins. Currently about 10% of the global propylene is produced via propane dehydrogenation (PDH), which is considered an economically and environmentally friendly route. Hence, PDH is expected to be applied more widely in the forthcoming years according to a forecast that catalytic dehydrogenation of propane would supply approximately 30% of the global propylene production by the year 20255 owing to the success in the large-scale exploitation of natural gas and shale gas. Among the industrialized protocols of direct dehydrogenation of light alkanes,69 two popularly used processes are the Catofin process and Oleflex process4 where the former uses a chromia-alumina catalyst and the latter a platinum-tin based catalyst.4,1017 Since direct dehydrogenation is endothermic in nature, substantial energy input and high temperature is required to achieve acceptable conversion and high yield of target olefins, limiting its overall energy efficiency.4,7,8 In addition, under such tough operation conditions, sintering and coking become serious and cause rapid catalyst deactivation, which thus requires frequent regeneration of the catalysts under high temperature oxidative conditions.15,1822 Coke formation may result in serious consequences, e.g. pressure drop, flow blockage, and decrease of production capacity, leading to low production efficiency.2325
1.1 Thermodynamics aspect of ODH
Oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of alkanes to olefins, featured by its intrinsic exothermicity and being free of coke, is a promising alternative to direct dehydrogenation.2833 It proceeds at a lower temperature without the need of catalyst regeneration. The oxidation of alkanes under aerobic conditions is generally believed to have a complicated reaction pattern demonstrated by the co-existence of various reaction channels under ODH conditions (Table 1).34,35 The rich side reaction channels, e.g. partial oxidation to oxygenated products and deep oxidation to COx, resulted in wide spectrum distribution of products. Thus, an uncatalyzed ODH reaction inevitably suffers from the low selectivity problem, and catalysts are required to promote the targeted reactions by manipulating the reaction kinetics in order to achieve high selectivity for olefins in the oxidative atmosphere.

Considerable efforts have been devoted to the development of efficient ODH catalytic systems to improve the selectivity of olefin products, most of which used metal-based catalysts. These metal-based catalysts displayed high reactivity toward the oxidative conversion of alkanes but suffered from serious deep oxidation to COx, causing significant CO2 emission, owing to the strong interaction between the defected electrophilic metal sites and the electron-rich olefin products. The discovery of boron-based metal-free catalysts showed that this was well circumvented owing to the nucleophilicity of the metal-free catalysts that repelled the approach of olefins.
1.2 Scope of this review
In the past few decades, the research interest in the ODH reaction of light alkanes has been focused on catalytic systems of transition metal oxides (e.g., V2O5, MoO3, and NiO) and alkaline-earth metal oxychlorides.30,36,37
The recent discovery of a novel metal-free catalyst, functionalized hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN), with high activity and selectivity to olefins as well as negligible formation of CO2, represents a breakthrough in the development of the catalytic oxidative dehydrogenation reaction system.38,39 Subsequently, this new catalytic system attracted considerable research interest in the field of catalysis and material science. A series of boron-based catalysts have been synthesized with exceptional activity similar to h-BN, which paved a new route to selective cleavage of CH bonds.4049 In addition, nanocarbons were also reported to be active in ODH reactions, and have been used as a platform for the fundamental understanding of ODH reactions.5053 These metal-free catalytic systems offered alternative choices to industrialize ODH protocols, and nurtured a new growing point in the utilization of light alkanes as clean energy resources. Meanwhile, there is a quick advance in the understanding of the mechanistic issues, including active site, and the catalytic mechanism, to facilitate rational design of the ODH catalytic systems. A timely survey of the current status is highly necessary in order to promote future study. For this reason, we proceeded to write this review on the study of the metal-free boron- and carbon-based ODH catalytic systems, and overviewed the recent progress in the design of metal-free catalytic materials, and the essential reaction characteristics, including the identification of active sites and the fundamental understanding of the catalytic mechanism, to constitute a comprehensive view to share with the community. This article was finalized with a perspective on future directions in metal-free ODH catalysts.
2 Boron-based catalysts for ODH
2.1 Feature of boron-containing compounds
Boron occurred in nature predominantly as an oxyanion in minerals. It is a chameleon-like element, and may adopt various chemical environments, either as a backbone component to build two- or three-dimensional networks or as a doping atom to incorporate into zeolites and carbon materials, through which their surface electron densities, acid/base properties and functional groups can be modified to improve their performance in catalysis.
Owing to its moderate electronegativity (2.0 in Pauling scale), boron may form borides with metal or nonmetal elements. These, denoted as MmBn, are a family of binary compounds constituted by boron and less electronegative metal or nonmetal elements. They are normally prepared by the following methods: direct combination of the elements at high temperature; reduction of mixed oxides with active metals, carbon, or boron carbide; and reduction of metal oxide with boron.54,55
Borides are diverse in their structural morphologies and stoichiometries. For metal borides, they are classified roughly into boron-rich borides (B:M  4:1) and metal-rich borides (B:M < 4:1). The metal-rich borides contain isolated boron atoms, B2 pairs, boron chains or boron sheets. The structures of boron-rich borides are dominated by inter-boron bonding, and comprise three-dimensional networks of boron atoms and clusters in which the atoms of other elements occupy specific voids or vacant sites. Generally, most of the borides are extremely hard, chemically inert and involatile, and are usually used in high-temperature reactor vessels, crucibles, pump impellers and thermocouple sheaths.
Its moderate electronegativity also enables boron to behave similar to carbon and silicon in its propensity to form covalently bound molecular compounds but with one less valence electron than the number of valence orbitals that they can form, a situation sometimes referred to as electron deficiency. This electron-deficient feature results in the complicated and fascinating properties of the compounds containing boron.5557 Its binary and ternary compounds with nonmetal elements, e.g. carbon, nitrogen, phosphorus, and oxygen, usually have similar physical properties and structural morphologies as metal borides.58,59
Boron oxide may breed various compounds by ready association with other elements, e.g. boric acid, borates, borosilicates,60 and boron phosphate.61,62 These compounds expanded the application of boron; for example, boron oxide and boric acid are widely used to prepare borates and other boron-containing materials, and borate has important applications in mineralogy, nonlinear optical materials, laser materials and catalysis. In these oxygenated compounds, boron may adopt two coordination modes, trigonal BO3 and BO4 tetrahedra (B2O6 units), which are generally neighbored to each other via a common vertex or edge to form BxOy polyanion clusters with various configurations.63,64Scheme 1 shows a typical structure of boron-based materials used as ODH catalysts.

2.2 Binary boron-based catalysts
2.2.1 Hexagonal boron nitride Boron nitrides (BN) may exist in three crystalline forms: graphite-like hexagonal BN (h-BN), diamond-like cubic BN (c-BN), and wurtzite BN (w-BN).65 Under standard conditions, h-BN with a layered structure analogous to graphite is the most stable BN phase.65 With the development of modern technology, h-BN has been synthesized through many methods, such as mechanical or chemical exfoliation, chemical vapor deposition (CVD), and solid-state reactions, and has been extensively used in electronics (wide bandgap (5.06.0 eV)), optics (no optical absorption in 390700 nm) and thermotics (high thermal conductivity 33 W m1 K1) benefitted from its excellent physical properties.67,68 In the field of heterogeneous catalysis, h-BN is generally considered to be chemically inert over the years and has been merely employed as a support in various reaction systems, such as ammonia synthesis,69,70 CO oxidation,71 selective oxidation,7275 and FischerTropsch synthesis.76 Besides, Bao et al. designed coreshell nanocatalysts by an encapsulation strategy and confirmed the confinement effect of h-BN shells that could stabilize the active metal components with an enhanced activity and stability for syngas methanation.77 Beyond that, investigation concerning its catalytic activity is scarce.78
Breakthrough was made when the Hermans group38 and Lu group39 independently reported their finding in the highly specific reactivity of h-BN in catalyzing the ODH of propane. Hermans and co-workers38 reported a selectivity of 79% for propylene and 12% for ethylene at 14% propane conversion in the h-BN catalytic system, which ran stably for over 32 h, with a COx proportion of 9%, a value far lower than that produced over traditional VOx/SiO2 catalysts at 9% propane conversion (Fig. 2a).38 Similar product distributions were observed when using BNNTs, but with a higher rate of propylene productivity (kgC3H6 kgcat1 h1) than h-BN by more than five times (Fig. 2b).

Lu and coworkers39 reported more pronounced performance of home-made edge-hydroxylated boron nitride (BNOH) in the ODH of propane and ethane to the corresponding olefins with high selectivity and negligible CO2 formation, on which high propane conversion (20.6%) and olefin selectivity (80.2% for C3 and 90.9% for C23) were achieved with considerably low CO2 formation (0.5%) (Fig. 2c). Meanwhile, feeding propylene and molecular oxygen did not consume propylene, demonstrating the suppression of its over-oxidation in the BNOH catalytic system. BNOH also exhibited olefin productivity of 6.8 golefin gcat1 h1, which was far higher than those of metal oxide catalysts, and remained stable for at least 300 h (Fig. 2d).
In the ODH of ethane on BNOH,42 the ethylene selectivity reached up to 95%, 90%, and 80% at the ethane conversion of 11%, 40%, and 63%, respectively, with only a negligible amount of CO2 (Fig. 3a). These results show that the BNOH catalyzed ODH is comparable to the industrialized ethane steam cracking process in view of their ethylene selectivity (85% at 60% ethane conversion for the latter), but wins over the latter considering the much lower reaction temperature and CO2 emission.79 The BNOH catalyst can also afford high ethylene productivity (9.1 gC2H4 gcat1 h1) with >90% selectivity by modulating the reaction conditions (Fig. 3b). The remarkable stability of the BNOH catalyst was evidenced by the operation for 200 h at 590 C (Fig. 3c). Such stable productivity far exceeded the critical value, 1 gC2H4 gcat1 h1, and demonstrated its potential application for industry.36

By means of various advanced experimental characterization techniques and computational methods, the determining role of edge BOH groups was identified unambiguously,39,42 which represented a distinct understanding with that reported.38 The comparative study40 on the catalytic activity of several boron-containing compounds (B4C, Ti2B, NiB, CoxB, HfB2, and WB) and elemental B in ODH also confirmed the importance of BO sites and showed that the absence of nitrogen sites did not eliminate the catalytic activity of boron-containing compounds. The knowledge on the responsible species in the h-BN catalytic systems has since then been evolving, and it is now a consensus38,39,42,78,8083 that oxygenated boron species dictate the performance of the boron-based catalysts.
The suppression of over-oxidation of alkanes on h-BN was also demonstrated by the ODH reactions of n-butane and isobutane,84 in which the main side products were observed to be C2 and C3 olefins rather than COx. In contrast, the main side product was COx in the Cr-based,85,86 V-based,87 and P modified CNT50 catalytic systems at similar alkane conversion levels. The total selectivity of all formed olefins (ethylene, propylene, butylene, and isobutylene) on the h-BN catalyst was over 85% at 10% alkane conversion. This also showed that h-BN may be used in n-butane oxidative cracking to produce ethylene and propylene by decreasing the presence of O2 to shift the dominant product distribution from butylenes (oxidative dehydrogenation products) to propylene and ethylene (cracking products), which may be further enhanced at elevated reaction temperature with high selectivity for propylene (43.9%) and ethylene (24.2%), and the catalytic system remained stable for over 100 h with low total COx selectivity (1.2%).88
Hexagonal boron nitride is known with the low presence of defects. Accordingly, an option to further optimize its catalytic performance would be to increase the number of active sites. High surface area boron nitride nanosheets synthesized by the reaction of boric acid with urea were reported to show high activity for ODH of ethane with nearly 100% selectivity for ethylene at 10% conversion of ethane, which changed to 60% if raising the ethane conversion to 78% during which the catalytic system remained stable for at least 400 h at 575 C.41 When using dicyanamide to substitute for urea in the preparation for high surface area boron nitride,43 its enhanced catalytic performance was maintained in the ODH of propane in view of the 53% propylene selectivity and 18% ethylene selectivity at a 52% propane conversion. However, the operation time of this catalytic system was measured to be only about 5 h, owing to the oxidation of surface BN bonds in the oxidative atmosphere, which may be improved by the addition of ammonia to more than 100 h. Ball-milled h-BN can expose more edge sites with significantly increased surface area, leading to a significant improvement in view of the ethylene selectivity (92%) at 10% ethane conversion in ODH of ethane compared to pristine h-BN (42%).89
The third way to increase the number of active sites is via nanostructural engineering by assembling 2D h-BN into a 3D spherical superstructure. This catalyst afforded a selectivity of 78% for propylene and 10% for ethylene at the propane conversion of 20% in the ODH of propane and operated for 100 h at 490 C, and increasing the temperature to 510 C resulted in high conversion of propane of 58% but bifurcated olefin selectivity (48% for propylene and 21% for ethylene).47 This study also showed that this morphology lowered the apparent activation energy to 175.3 kJ mol1, implicating that lower energy channels were favored on this catalyst.
The preparation of a boron nitride wash-coated monolithic catalyst49 offered an applicable way to improve, besides the olefin selectivity, the heat and mass transfer which is vital for industrialization owing to the intrinsic feature of high exothermicity of the ODH reaction that could produce hotspots and thus subsequent negative consequences in the olefin selectivity and safety issues. This h-BN wash-coated cordierite monolithic catalyst was fabricated by chemical vapor deposition using boric acid and urea as precursors, and exhibited 82.1% propylene selectivity with only 3.7% CO and no detected CO2 at 16.8% propane conversion in the ODH of propane with high gas hourly space velocity (GHSV, 576000 mL gBN1 h1) (Fig. 4a). The well-developed straight-channel and short diffusive pathway of the thin wash-coated h-BN layer guaranteed the mass transfer process at high GHSV, and achieved a high propylene productivity of 18.6 gC3H6 gBN1 h1, both of which are critical indicators for the potential industrial implementation of ODH.49

The presence of hotspots in the catalyst bed is a typical phenomenon in the ODH of light alkanes owing to its highly exothermic nature, which can significantly accelerate the undesired over-oxidation of olefins, leading to a low selectivity to olefins. It is a consensus that the catalyst design is one of the two key components in an industrial implementation, with another one the reactor engineering, and an ideal strategy is determined by their optimal synergy.9 Boron nitride materials are known with high thermal conductivity (33 W m1 K1), and thus are ideal choices to remove quickly the heat generated in ODH reactions, which is crucial to the industrialization of the ODH protocol. A recent computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulation compared the hotspot and the temperature profiles in the fixed-bed reactor in the ODH of propane using h-BN and VOx/γ-Al2O3 as catalysts, respectively,90 and showed that the temperature of the catalyst bed increased by less than 1 C in the h-BN catalyst bed which was much smaller than that in the VOx/γ-Al2O3 catalyst bed (8 C) at a similar propane conversion (25%) with a micro-tubular reactor of 6 mm in diameter. The high thermal conductivity of an h-BN catalyst could maintain isothermal operation in such a micro-tubular reactor at even up to 590 C with a higher propane conversion of 45%. In contrast, a hotspot of >5 C temperature gradient was inevitable in the VOx/γ-Al2O3 catalyst bed even at the relatively low temperature of 520 C. In an industrially relevant reactor with an inner diameter of 60 mm, the h-BN catalyst bed maintained a uniform temperature profile (a temperature gradient as small as 1.5 C), while the VOx/γ-Al2O3 catalyst bed suffered from a temperature gradient of 47 C (Fig. 4b). These results suggest that the superior thermal conductivity the h-BN catalyst favors its industrial practice in ODH of light alkanes conducted in a fixed-bed reactor.
The investigation of the influence of reactor parameters on the ODH of propane using the h-BN catalyst showed91 that there was little transport limitation, and the use of SiC as an inert catalyst diluent may promote the catalysis significantly. This work attributed this to the contribution of the surface-initiated gas phase radical reactions, which is different from the opinion in the CFD simulation90 that emphasized the known high thermal conductivity of the catalyst. In this work, the authors reported a volcano-like dependence of the propane consumption rate on the mass of h-BN. This may be the consequence of multiple reasons, e.g. the contribution of gas-phase radical chemistry that did not rely on the quantity of the catalyst, the forming and encapsulation of the catalyst, and other issues, which remain to be clarified.
2.2.2 Silicon boride Silicon borides have a number of phases with a stoichiometric ratio of B:Si ranging from 3 to 6 with complicated morphologies varied from homogeneity to heterogeneity.9294 According to a crystallographic study, the unit cell of SiB6 contains 289 atoms with 281 of them building up interconnected icosahedra (18) and icosihexahedra (4).95 Silicon borides are generally synthesized by melting a certain proportion of elemental silicon and boron at high temperature and pressure, and adjusting the temperature and the ratio of B/Si may result in their various phases.
Silicon borides are widely used as substrates in the synthesis of ceramic composite96 and borosilicate glass materials,97 or as an additive in the modification of carbon fibre/lithium aluminosilicate composites.98 They are also used as an antioxidant coating material taking advantage of the facile formation of an oxide film on their surface, showing their good oxidation resistance at high temperatures.99,100
Though rarely used in catalysis, their rich boron sites and good oxidation resistance endow them as potential catalysts to promote ODH of light alkanes. In a recent study, oxygenated silicon borides were prepared with SiB6 as the main phases and remarkable catalytic performance was observed in ODH of light alkanes including ethane (95.8% C2 at 29% ethane conversion, and 90% C2 at 50% conversion), propane (82.2% C3 at 19% propane conversion, and 88.7% C23 at 31% propane conversion) and isobutane (77.1% C4 and 96.4% C24 at 6% isobutane conversion, and 90.9% C24 at 15.6% isobutane conversion),45 showing superior performance in resisting over-oxidation of olefins at high conversion (Fig. 5). In addition, the light olefin productivity was up to 1.22.6 golefins gcat1 h1, and the silicon boride catalyst in the ODH of propane remained stable for more than 100 h.45 Note that most silicon boride materials have relatively low specific surface areas, and the synthesis of silicon boride with high specific surface may be an effective way to improve its catalytic activity.

2.2.3 Boron carbide Boron carbide (B410.4C) is a compositionally disordered material with rhombohedral phase.101,102 The primary structural units of boron carbide are the 12-atom icosahedra located at the vertices of a rhombohedral lattice of trigonal symmetry, and the 3-atom linear chains that link the icosahedra along the (111) rhombohedral axis (Fig. 6a and b).103 Since it was reported in 1883, various protocols for its synthesis have been developed, including magnesiothermic reduction, carbothermic reduction, vapor phase reactions, synthesis from elements and synthesis from polymer precursors,101 to produce boron carbide with distinct morphologies (Fig. 6c and d), e.g. thin films via direct ion-beam deposition and plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition from boranes,104,105 nanorods by reacting carbon nanotubes (CNTs) with boron powder, the boron carbide nanoparticles that can be synthesized by reacting multiwall CNT with magnesium diboride at high temperature in a vacuum or an inert atmosphere,106,107 bulk boron carbide by the reaction of boric acid and polyvinyl alcohol at low temperature,108 and fine powder, fibers, whiskers and thin film coating of boron carbide101 by vapor phase reactions.

Owing to its superior properties such as high hardness (29.1 GPa), high melting point (2450 C), high elastic modulus (448 GPa) and chemical inertness, B4C is widely applied in wear-resistant materials, vehicle armor, and strengthening medium. Furthermore, B4C can also be used as a nuclear reactor, neutron detector and shielding material,111,112 owing to its capability to absorb neutrons without forming long-lived radionuclides.
In recent years, boron carbide has been used in catalysis as a support in methanol oxidation113 and proton exchange membrane (PEM) fuel cells114 to load Pt catalysts or directly participated in catalyzed oxidative desulfurization for ultra-deep desulfurization.115 Its activity in catalyzing oxidative ODH reactions was also reported40 displaying the same catalytic behavior as h-BN in ODH of propane with an alkane consumption rate of 4.7 × 103 molC3H8 kgcat1 s1 at 500 C and remaining stable for 2 days (Fig. 6e).
2.2.4 Boron oxide Boron oxide (B2O3) with low melting point (450 C) and low viscosity (436 Poise at 750 C) is mainly found in the vitreous form116 featuring a random three-dimensional network of BO3-triangles with a comparatively high fraction of six-membered rings (boroxol rings) and a portion of non-ring BO3/2 units,117119 with the boroxol rings decaying in the liquid state with increasing temperature.120 Due to its low melting point of boron oxide and its dispersion behavior, when used in catalysis, it is often used as a supported catalyst, e.g. on Al2O3, ZrO2, TiO2, SiO2, MgO and zeolites,121125 and it has been reported to be active in the Beckmann rearrangement of cyclohexanone oxime,126 cyclohexene hydrogen transfer reaction,127 disproportionation of toluene and isomerization reaction.128 The supported boron oxide catalysts consist of tri-coordinated BO3 species and tetra-coordinated BO4 species, and the proportion of tetra-coordinated BO4 species is closely related to the enhanced Brnsted acidity when increasing the amount of loaded boron oxide.129,130 The morphology of the loaded boron oxide may be manipulated by vapor decomposition of B(OEt)3 onto silica gel126 to produce more active sites and uniformly distributed acidic sites for improved catalytic performance compared to the ordinary impregnation method using H3BO3. Unsupported boron oxide was rarely reported in catalysis.131
Owing to the exothermic feature of alkane oxidation, when used in the partial oxidation and ODH of light alkane, boron oxide was prepared in its supported form to avoid its leakage. In earlier studies, supported boron oxide catalysts on metal oxides (Al2O3, MgO, La2O3, ZnO, etc.) were prepared132,133 for the partial oxidation of ethane, where the B2O3(30 wt%)/Al2O3 exhibited the best catalytic performance in the production of acetaldehyde (selectivity: 2.7%, yield: 1.03%) and ethylene (selectivity: 58.0%, yield: 14.6%) with an ethane conversion of 38.0% at 550 C, but at the cost of emission of a large amount of CO (selectivity: 31.0%). The active site for the initial activation of ethane (CH bond cleavage) was suggested to be crystalline B2O3, but that for further oxidation to acetaldehyde could be different from the formation of ethylene. Similarly, Auroux et al.134 synthesized an alumina-boria catalyst by chemical vapor deposition and obtained more dispersed boron oxide on the support surface for ethane selective oxidation. The highest activity was observed with 30 wt% boron oxide loading on non-porous Al2O3 where the ethylene yield was 16.7% at 18.7% ethane conversion. CO and CH4 were the main by-products, coming from the decomposition of ethylene. Later, Buyevskaya et al.135137 reported selective oxidation of propane to olefins and oxygenates on supported boron oxide catalysts. The highest selectivity of propylene was 42% at 30% propane conversion on B2O3/Al2O3; in addition, the selectivity of C1C3 oxygenates was up to 28%. The trigonal BO3 species present in both crystalline and amorphous phases are active in the dehydrogenation of propane to propylene, and oxygenate formation was favored in the presence of Al6B8O21 phase. The above-mentioned alumina-boria catalysts also displayed catalytic activity for partial oxidation of light alkanes. However, for ODH of light alkanes to olefins, there still existed a significant amount of deep oxidation products, such as oxygenates, CO and CO2, due to the strong acidic sites generated by depositing boron oxide on amphoteric alumina. Besides, the leaching of boron under reaction conditions led to the instability of boron oxide catalysts.
These supported boron oxide catalysts are deficient in common in the nonnegligible deep oxidation. This is most possibly due to the supports which are intrinsically active to catalyze the oxidation of alkanes.
2.2.4.1 Boron oxide supported on silica In order to remove the influence of the support and figure out the origin of the catalytic ability of boron oxide, Lu's group44 reported a supported boron oxide catalyst synthesized by incipient wetness impregnation of boric acid on the high specific area mesoporous silica (B2O3/SBA-15, denoted as BOS catalyst) which showed remarkable selectivity to catalyze the ODH of propane. The BOS catalyst contained four types of boron species (Fig. 7a and b), i.e. boroxol ring (B(3a)), tri-coordinated hydroxylated linear BO3/2 (B(3b)), and tri-coordinated planar boron species (B(3c)) and a tetra-coordinated tetrahedral boron species (B(4)) which were fused into the silica matrix. This catalyst was active at a temperature as low as 405 C, which is about 100 C lower than that of the BN catalyst, showing a propane conversion of 2.8% and a propylene selectivity of 84.1% (C23: 94.6%). Increasing the temperature to 450 C raised the propane conversion to 14.8% with a selectivity of 73.3% for propylene and 87.4% for both propylene and ethylene (C23), and the BOS catalyst was stable during the 30 hours operation at 450 C. Both experimental and theoretical studies indicated that tri-coordinated boroxol ring and hydroxylated linear boron species were the active sites responsible for the low temperature activity and high efficiency in catalyzing ODH of light alkanes. A study138 of the same catalytic system reported consistent results, in which similar responsible oxygenated boron species were proposed (Fig. 7c) and a selectivity of 77% for propylene and of 91% for overall olefin (C23) corresponding to a propane conversion of 5% at 500 C were obtained (Fig. 7d).

2.2.4.2 Boron oxide embedded in zeolites Zeolites are crystalline aluminosilicate materials with three-dimensional network containing channels and cavities of molecular dimensions, and the presence of Al in tetrahedra makes the framework negatively charged.139 In their protonated form, they may be used for acid-catalyzed refining of biomass and crude oil.140 New types of zeolite may be created by means of the so-called isomorphous substitution, e.g. high silica zeolites141 and borosilicate zeolites,142,143 including RUT,144,145 Beta,143 MFI,146,147 MEL,148 MWW,149 CHA,150 FAU,151,152 and UTL.153 Compared with aluminosilicate, borosilicate zeolites exhibit lower acidity owing to the weaker BO bond that was protonated.154 This weaker BO bond can be broken upon dehydration and rebuilt upon hydration, enabling the boron atoms to be tetra-, tri-coordinated or both in the framework.143,155,156 Further hydrolysis leads to the leakage of boron from the framework in the form of boric acid, leaving silanol nests155 which can be used for isomorphous substitution of heteroatoms157,158 or generating mesopores.159
The weak Brnsted acid site of borosilicate zeolites has been confirmed vital to the improvement of selectivity in some reactions, e.g. xylene isomerization,160 olefin oligomerization,161 Beckmann rearrangement of cyclohexanone oxime162,163 and methanol conversion to hydrocarbons.164,165 In methanol to propylene (MTP) reaction, pure B-MFI zeolites were found to be insufficient to activate methanol,166 and those with weak acidity could catalyze methylation which is vital to olefin formation.165 Studies revealed that the acidity of the catalysts was a dominant factor in determining the key step of methanol converting to propylene in the process of olefin formation.167,168 However, strong acidity was shown to be a double-sided sword, e.g. for ZSM-5 zeolite, and may promote the conversion of methanol on one hand, while accelerating the side reaction on the other hand and lead to the deactivation of the catalysts. It was shown that the strong acidic sites of ZSM-5 zeolite may be modified by doping boron to give rise to weak Brnsted acidity, which prevented the formation of ethylene oligomers and resulted in higher propylene selectivity in methanol conversion.142,164,165
Isomorphous substitution of tri- or tetravalent metal atoms (Al, Ti, Fe and V) by borosilicate zeolites is a good route in the production of some new zeolites that need expensive organic structure directing agents (OSDAs), long crystallization time or co-presence of dopant.157,158,169 For example, the Ti-MWW with high crystallinity was successfully synthesized based on the ERB-1 (MWW topology) where the boron acid acted as a structure-supporting agent.170 Furthermore, taking advantage of the high propensity of boron to hydrolyze, its presence benefits the fabrication of mesoporous zeolite, and may increase the mesopore volume by 46%.159
Recently, layered borosilicate zeolite (ERB-1, MWW structure) with defective trigonal boron species was reported as a highly active and selective catalyst for the ODH of propane to take advantage of their specific morphology inherent with large internal surface areas, micropore structure and high thermal stability.171 In these synthesized zeolites, the boron species were classified into five types according to solid-state 11B MAS NMR, i.e. framework trigonal B(OSi)xOH3x(x=1,2), B(OSi)3, tetrahedral B(OH)2(OSi)2, B(OSi)4 and aggregated terminal BOH species (Fig. 8a and b). The layered borosilicate zeolites showed comparable catalytic activity with h-BN in the ODH of propane, and increasing boron content resulted in higher propane conversion with the propane conversion of 5.6%, 9.3% and 30.6% corresponding to the boron content of 1.54 wt.% (BZEO-1), 2.48 wt.% (BZEO-2) and 4.88 wt.% (BZEO-3), respectively (Fig. 8c), among which the BZEO-2 was determined as the optimal recipe which afforded a C3 selectivity of 80.4% and C23 of 91.6% at 15.6% conversion of propane (Fig. 8d). Owing to the large surface area and micropore structure, the catalyst was stable for 20 h under ODH conditions without structural collapse (Fig. 8e). These recipes had similar active sites in view of their similar apparent activation energies in the ODH of propane (Fig. 8f). In ethane ODH, the layered borosilicate zeolite exhibits 30.6% ethylene yield at 37.6% ethane conversion. This catalyst provided a new platform to investigate the influence of the microporous structure on the transport of gaseous species and the construction of a specific chemical environment for boron in the ODH of light alkanes in order to achieve optimal performance.

2.3 Ternary boron-based catalyst: boron phosphate
Boron phosphate (BPO4) has superior thermal stability, high thermal conductivity (ka = 62.4 W m1 K1, kc = 51.5 W m1 K1), strong anisotropic thermal expansion and outstanding oxidation resistance.172175 The crystal structure of BPO4 is featured by a continuous three-dimensional framework composed of corner-sharing BO4 and PO4 tetrahedra (Fig. 9a), isomorphous with α-quartz or β-cristobalite.176179 BPO4 is usually synthesized from precursors H3PO4 and H3BO3, B2O3 and (NH4)2HPO4, or B2O3 and P2O5 at a temperature ranging from 80 to 1200 C.180,181 Other methods e.g. solvothermal synthesis,182,183 top-seeding flux growth184,185 and microwave-assisted methods,181 were also reported.

Benefitting from the coexistence of Brnsted and Lewis acidic sites (Fig. 9b),186 BPO4 manifested itself as an effective solid acid catalyst in organic reactions, such as dehydration,187,188 oligomerization,189 decomposition,190,191 Beckmann rearrangement,192 and alkylation.193 In the study194 of selective dehydration of 1,2-propanediol to propanal by the evaporation method, BPO4 exhibited more durable activity and offered a higher yield of propanal over 95% at low temperature than conventional solid acid catalysts. It was also supported on silica by chemical vapor deposition using a mixture of boron triethoxide and phosphoryl trimethoxide and used in the isomerization of 1-butylene and simultaneous oligomerization of 1-butane.195
In an earlier study,196199 mixed oxides of boron and phosphorus were reported to show activity in the partial oxidation of light alkanes (CH4, C2H6, and C3H8), with high conversion of light alkanes and a wide spectrum of oxygenated products. When the C3H8 conversion approached 53%, the selectivity of C3-oxygenates, C3H6, C2 + C1 oxygenates and CO was 8.1%, 31.7%, 10.4% and 26.7%, respectively. In the CH4 or C2H6 partial oxidation, the selectivity of HCHO and CH3CHO could be obtained as high as 13.7% and 14.2%. In these studies, olefin products did not present as major products, showing that the responsible species in the catalytic system favored mono-oxygen insertion into the CH and CC bonds more than dehydrogenation of the alkane substrates. Note that these studies did not characterize the structure of the catalyst and it is unknown whether the mixed oxides were BPO4 or something else. It is worth carrying out an extensive study to solve these puzzles.
It is known that the preparation of BPO4 crystals often requires high temperature and produces bulk solids with low surface areas. This in general disfavors the exposure of active sites and the maximization of surface area. Methods developed to tackle this issue include the creation of ordered microporous morphology in the bulk of BPO4200 or loading it onto a support. In a recent work, in order to improve the exposure of active sites and the mass transfer, a three-dimensional ordered macroporous BPO4 material was developed200 with a robust framework (Fig. 9c), which exhibited excellent activity and selectivity in the ODH of propane with a selectivity of 91.5% for olefins (propylene: 82.5%, ethylene: 9.0%) at a propane conversion of 14.3% at 515 C and a selectivity for the unwanted deep-oxidized CO2 product of less than 1.0%. Furthermore, the catalyst exhibited a remarkable olefin productivity of 16 golefin gcat1 h1, which well outperformed most ODH catalysts (Fig. 9d).
BPO4 was also used as a support in ODH catalytic systems. A B2O3@BPO4 sandwich-like hollow sphere (Fig. 9e) was reported as a liquid-phase catalyst in ODH of propane,48 and remained stable for 27 h at 550 C with a C3H6 productivity of 0.79 gC3H6 gcat1 h1 and a selectivity of 66.4% for propylene and 18.4% for ethylene at a propane conversion of 24.7%. The loaded B2O3 was proposed in its molten state and worked as the active species, as in previous work of boron-containing catalytic systems, and BPO4 acted not only as a support, but also as a cocatalyst in the reaction.48 Compared to the performance of other boron-based ODH catalysts, this material remains to be improved in its operation stability and olefin productivity (Fig. 9f).
2.4 Mechanistic issue
2.4.1 Nature of the active sites Identification of the active sites of boron-based catalysts is crucial to understand the catalytic origin, and to guide the design and evaluation of new boron-based catalysts. In the survey of h-BN and BNNT catalytic systems, Lu et al. noticed81 a low initial activity (<3%) in ODH of propane prior to reaching their stable performance, which implicated an activation period. This suggested that the intact boron nitrides were inert to the reactants under the ODH reaction conditions, and the high catalytic activity of boron nitrides was the consequence of their in situ surface functionalization. Thus, tailoring functional groups of boron nitride would be beneficial for optimal catalytic performance, and help to understand the nature of the active sites and catalytic origin. The BNOH catalyst offered a good test bed to verify the active sites by a tidy assembly of oxygenated groups at the edges or the defects mainly in the form of >BOH, BOB, which may be easily accessible for substrates.
In a detailed structural analysis of the BNOH catalyst,39 aberration-corrected transmission electron microscopy (TEM) identified a large number of accessible edges generated after functionalization at the edges (Fig. 10a), and showed that lattice relaxations and distortions occurred exclusively at the edge of the layer. Boron K-edge electron energy-loss spectroscopy (EELS) analysis with a high-angle annular dark-field (HAADF) STEM mode showed that the B/N ratio at the edge (1.28, point 2 in Fig. 10b) was higher than that of the in-plane (0.95, point 4 in Fig. 10b). This result suggested that a gradual substitution of nitrogen by oxygen occurred during the functionalization of pristine boron nitride. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and 2D 11B multiple quantum (MQ) magic-angle spinning (MAS) NMR spectrum identified that there were two types of BO groups on the catalyst surface: the edge boron sites bonded to two bridging oxygen atoms and the BOH sites (Fig. 10c and d). Considering the inert nature of pure h-BN, the nascent functional groups (BOB and BOH groups) formed at the edge of BNOH were considered to be responsible for its catalytic activity in the ODH reaction, which was supported by the FTIR spectra that showed that the OH groups interacted with the reactant and incorporated into the reaction network.39

The presence of BOH groups was also reported38 in the study of ODH of propane on h-BN and BNNT through the characterization of the materials in their fresh and spent forms by means of advance experimental techniques, e.g. XPS, ATR-IR, and DRIFTS, and the hypothetical peroxyl-bridged armchair edge of BN (>BOON<) was proposed to serve as an active site in the ODHP reaction. This was different from the abovementioned hypothesis39 that the oxygenated boron species at the zig-zag edge were the active sites. In a later work, Hermans and coworkers characterized80 the structure of h-BN and BNNTs materials in the ODHP reaction by using 11B solid-state NMR, SEM and soft-XAS, and identified the existence of B(OH)xO3x (where x = 03) phase under reaction conditions (Fig. 11a and b). This study showed that approximately 30% of h-BN and 80% of BNNTs were converted to B(OH)xO3x phase in the spent materials, and confirmed the crucial role of oxygenated boron species at the edges or at the defects.39 Recently, Rossini and co-workers201 identified the existence of boron hydroxide/oxide termination on h-BN edges by means of combined 11B, 14N and 15N solid-state NMR spectroscopy and plane-wave DFT calculations.

A latter density functional theory (DFT) study202 tried to compromise the two hypotheses of Hermans and Lu groups in the O2 activation in the ODH of propane on h-BN, in which the reactivities of armchair, boron-atom-terminated zigzag (zig-B), and nitride-atom-terminated zigzag (zig-N) edges of h-BN were compared and proposed that O2 was more likely to be activated at the zig-B edge. This study stressed the important role of the zig-zag edge of h-BN in the ODH of propane, which was consistent with the opinion in earlier work,39 but remained to be improved for a fair comparison of the various potential reactive sites by using an equivalent reference point.
The governing role of oxygenated boron species in the ODH of light alkanes has been extended to explain the activity of other boron-based materials, e.g. B4C, Ti2B, NiB, elemental boron,40 and silicon boride203 In these catalytic systems, resembling surface species and kinetic behaviors to h-BN in the ODH reaction were observed. These results implicated that the boron-based catalysts have similar active phases of oxygenated species (BO or BOH) on the catalyst surfaces.
This was directly demonstrated in a work that used boron oxides supported on silicon oxide as the catalyst that explicitly correlated the catalytic activity to the percentages of oxygenated species. To better understand the structure of the active sites, Lu and coworkers synthesized mesoporous silica-supported boron oxide catalysts (B2O3/SBA-15) and identified four B species by using the 11B NMR technique,44 two of which on the upfield side (B(3a) and B(3B) in Fig. 7a) were considered as the responsible species for the activity by analyzing their variations before and after the ODHP test. With the aid of DFT calculations, these species were characterized as the boroxol ring and the tricoordinated planar BO3/2 species, respectively.
The activity of tricoordinated boron species and the inertness of tetracoordinated species were confirmed in further studies of the boronsilicate zeolite catalytic system.46,171 These studies also showed that clustered distribution of tricoordinated boron species is necessary. In the study using a layered borosilicate zeolite (ERB-1, an MWW borosilicate zeolite) with defective trigonal boron species as the catalyst,171 abundant presence of defective trigonal boron species (OBOH and B(OSi)xOH3x(x=1,2) species) was reported based on the data of FT-IR and 11B MAS NMR, and proposed to be responsible for the activity of propane ODH. These types of species (Fig. 7c) were also proposed to present in the amorphous silica supported oxidized boron catalytic system during the ODH of propane captured by IR, Raman, and solid-state NMR spectroscopy (Fig. 11c, d and e).138 When boron was incorporated into the zeolite framework as isolated BO3 species (equivalent as B(3c) in ref. 44 or isolated BO3 in ref. 138), its activity to catalyze the ODHP reaction was lost.46 This result gives a new perspective to the active sites and implicated that their accumulation at the surface was a prerequisite to promote the ODH reaction. Note that these incorporated species were considered inactive in the ODH of propane in an earlier work.44
2.4.2 Reaction mechanisms Characterization of the kinetics of the ODH reactions via advanced experimental techniques provided abundant information to understand the underlying mechanism. The combination of in situ FTIR and online MS showed39 that the signals of OH groups of the BNOH catalyst remained unchanged in the absence of O2 in the feed gas, but diminished in the presence of O2, implicating that the co-presence of alkane and O2 is a prerequisite in the ODH of light alkanes catalyzed by boron-based catalysts. The diminished signals of an OH group could be recovered under a steam atmosphere (Fig. 12a), which, together with the isotope labelling experiment, showed the direct involvement of water in the replenish of the BOH groups. These spectroscopic data and kinetic experiments indicated that the hydrogen and oxygen atoms of OH(D) groups were involved in the reaction process (Fig. 12b and c), which also lent support to a later computational study of the mechanism that considered the breakage of the BO(H) bond during the reaction.204 The kinetic analysis suggested that the reaction order of O2 was 0.5, implicating the dissociation of O2 in the ODH reaction. The reaction order of C3H8 was calculated to be 2, and the kinetic isotope effects of CH cleavage were measured to be 1.4 for primary hydrogen abstraction and 1.5 for secondary hydrogen abstraction. The results suggested that activation of propane determined the total reaction rate, based on which a reaction mechanism was proposed78,81 (Fig. 12d) initiated by the reaction of BOH groups with O2 to generate active species that may further dehydrogenate propane to produce propylene and water, and recover BOH groups.

Based on experimental results and DFT calculations, a mechanism involving radical chemistry was proposed42,54 with the essence being that the BOH groups of the BNOH catalyst may be dehydrogenated by O2 and generated BNO and HO2 radicals in ODH of propane and ethane (Fig. 13a), which initialized the gas phase radical chemistry. The BNO radical tended to react with ethane leading to the production of alkane radicals (C3H7 and C2H5), which were then dehydrogenated by O2 or H2O2, and produced C2H4. This radical-mediated mechanism was supported by later studies of the ODH of propane on supported boron oxide catalysts44 and on h-BN.91 In the ODH of propane using supported h-BN catalyst,91 the inactive diluent (SiC) was found to be able to affect the gas-phase chemistry (Fig. 13b), and the BOx sites of the h-BN were proposed to act as initiators to generate C3H7 radicals, which can decompose to products in the gas phase and, if reacting with O2, generate HO2 and HO radicals. This radical-mediated selective oxidation mechanism was previously proposed for the Li/MgO and Li/Dy/MgO catalyst systems,205 which catalyzed selective oxidative cracking of n-butane under O2-lean conditions. This pattern of selectivity appeared nearly identical as in the h-BN catalytic system, implicating potential similarities in the mechanisms between these catalytic systems. Further support came from a recent direct detection206 of the gas-phase methyl radicals (CH3) in the ODH of propane by using online synchrotron vacuum ultraviolet photoionization mass spectroscopy (SVUP-MS) in which the C3H6 was revealed to mainly form on the h-BN surface while C2 and C1 products were generated from catalyst surfaces and gas-phase pathways.

Other studies also enriched the understanding of the reaction mechanism. A combined in situ spectroscopy and kinetic analysis study of the ODH of ethane41 proposed that the C2H6 underwent a nearly direct dehydrogenation to produce C2H4 and H2 with the aid of O2 adsorption at a low temperature (XC2H6 < 10%), and at high temperature (XC2H6 > 10%), the ethane promoted the activation of adsorbed O2, resulting in the formation of BO(H) sites, and completed the reaction cycle over BO sites.
In the studies of the ODH of propane, the selectivity of C2-products was noticed to be much higher than that of C1-products over an h-BN catalyst in ODH of propane, implicating complicated channels leading to these cracking products. This puzzle was solved in a later study207 and the C2-products were reported to be formed via oxidative coupling of methyl radicals in addition to the channels of CC breaking of propane, which explained the higher selectivity of C2-products than the C1-products. This hypothesis offered further support to the radical-mediated mechanism.
3 Progress in carbon-based catalysts for ODH
3.1 Carbon-based catalysts used in ODH
Carbonaceous materials as catalysts in ODH reactions were first reported in the 1960s. In earlier studies the pyrolyzed polyacrylonitrile,208 polynaphthoquinone,209 and surface modified activated carbons210,211 were used as catalysts, and the oxygenated functional groups, e.g. carbonyl/quinone groups on the surface were generally considered key to their activity.
Although the production technology of activated carbon is mature in industry, this amorphous carbon with poor crystallinity and abundant micropores usually has the risk of combusting at high temperature and in an oxidative atmosphere. Nanocarbon materials with high crystallinity would be more antioxidative to act as stable catalysts in ODH reactions. Schlgl's group first reported nanocarbons (carbon nanofilaments (CNFs), and onion-like carbons (OLCs)) as efficient metal-free catalysts for oxidative dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene (EB) compared to soot, graphite and industrial KFe catalysts.212,213 CNFs also exhibited considerable catalytic performance in the ODH of propane to propylene,214 but suffered from severe gasification under harsh oxidative reaction conditions, which may be alleviated by loading phosphoric oxides in CNFs to deliver a stable catalytic performance of 17% propylene yield and an inhibition of the over-oxidation of propane.
The importance of the crystallinity of a carbon-based catalyst in the ODH of light alkanes was further confirmed in the study of Su and co-workers who employed carbon nanotubes (CNTs) to convert 1-butylene and obtained a 40% butadiene yield, which was superior to that of activated carbon and iron oxide.215 The passivation of defects of oxidized carbon nanotubes with phosphorus (P-oCNTs) may also enhance the C4 olefin selectivity by suppressing combustion for at least 100 h in the ODH of n-butane compared to CNTs and oCNTs.50
Considerable efforts have been made in ODH of light alkane reaction systems over nanostructured carbonaceous catalysts (Scheme 2), such as nanodiamond (ND),216219 graphitic carbons (GC)220224 and other carbons,225227 which enriched the family of metal-free carbon catalyst and expanded the insight of traditional catalysis.

3.2 Identification of active sites
Carbon materials have complex surface compositions and structures, and are rich in functional groups, defects and edge sites, making it difficult to establish a clear structureactivity relationship regarding their catalytic performance in ODH of alkanes. In earlier studies, oxygen containing carbonaceous species were proposed to be responsible for their activity in ethylbenzene (EB) ODH.209,228,229 This was verified by characterization of the surface oxygenated groups using temperature-programmed desorption (TPD) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) techniques230 and thermal and chemical treatments of carbonaceous materials,231 from which a linear relationship between the EB conversion rates and the surface concentration of carbonyl/quinone groups based on TPD results (Fig. 14a) was established.231

Since the edge sites, defect sites and other oxygenated groups (hydroxyl, carboxylic acid, and anhydride groups) of carbon may convert to carbonyl groups in the aerobic environment at increased temperature, it is not straightforward to identify their specific roles and contributions.52,232 To avoid this ambiguity, Qi et al. proposed a chemical titration method (ex situ and in situ) using an analogous organic molecule, i.e. phenylhydrazine, to selectively passivate the specific oxygenated functional groups (ketonic or quinone carbonyl groups) (Fig. 14b). This method provided an intrinsic catalytic activity value (turnover frequency, TOF, based on ketonic carbonyl groups) among various nanocarbon catalysts (GO materials, CNTs and OLCs), revealing that ketonic or quinone carbonyl groups were identical active sites of nanocarbons for an EB ODH reaction.233,234 Moreover, certain polymers were also synthesized to serve as model catalysts, only containing the quinone carbonyl groups, to provide indirect evidence for identifying active sites.235,236 The important role of quinone groups or ketonic groups was also demonstrated in view of their presence on the spent CNFs and OLCs after the EB ODH212,213 and the sharp increase of the ratio of XPS signal strength I(COH)/I(CO) (from 0.72 to 1.87) was observed after switching off the oxygen in the ODH of n-butane (Fig. 14c).50
Besides the studies that supported the significant role of carbonyl/quinone groups in ODH of hydrocarbon,225,235239 there were also opinions52,220,221 that proposed the edge sites and defects of the carbon catalysts as the active sites rather than the quinone-type groups. DFT study on the role of the surface oxygen content, edge sites and defects of a few-layer graphene model suggested that the exposed edges of carbon materials were essential and the dicarbonyls at the zigzag edges and quinones at armchair edges might be responsible for high activity (Fig. 14d).223,224
By means of first-principles calculations, epoxy groups,240 ketone, diketone and quinone groups241 have been evaluated as potential active sites in the ODH of propane. These studies proposed the CH bond breaking of propane as the rate-determining step, and showed the site-dependence of the activity which emphasized the importance of surface modification.240 The progress of the computational studies on the ODH of light alkanes catalyzed by nanocarbons has been reviewed and close cooperation between experimental and theoretical studies is expected to further promote the development of ODH reaction systems.242
As mentioned above, the carbonyl/quinone groups could be considered as active sites and a plausible mechanism was proposed that carbonyl/quinone groups could abstract hydrogen atoms from the CH bonds of alkane to form olefin, then gas phase oxygen molecules or dissociated oxygen species react with abstracted hydrogen atoms to form water, involving the regeneration of active sites. A recent review of oxidative dehydrogenation on nanocarbon catalysts from an in situ experimental account stressed that the behavior of O2 or dissociated oxygenated species was still not clear enough to establish a detailed catalytic mechanism of the ODH process from the molecular or atomic level, and more in situ characterizations were required to capture the intermediate species during the activation process of oxygen molecules.53
3.3 Selectivity control of olefins
Generally, the selectivity of styrene is close to 90% in EB ODH reaction over carbonaceous catalysts probably due to the stable π-conjugated structure of styrene which enables it to survive from being further oxidized. Such a conjugated structure is absent in olefins produced in the ODH of light alkanes, and their oxidation produces unwanted COx product under the severe reaction conditions. The ODH of alkanes may be considered to include competitive reactions (Scheme 3) from alkanes to olefins (rate constant of k1) and to COx (k3), and the over-oxidation of alkenes to COx (k2),221,243 in which k1 was usually less than k2 and a maximum olefin yield (35%) could be reached when k1 was equal to k2.243
Scheme 3 The competitive pathways in the ODH of light alkanes.
Typically, the surface oxygen species of nanocarbons are classified into electrophilic (superoxide O2, peroxide O22) and nucleophilic (O2) types.50 Electrophilic oxygen species are electron-deficient and they prefer to attack the electron-rich CC bonds in olefins, which could increase the k2 value, causing the rupture of the carbon skeleton and lowering the selectivity of olefins. In contrast, electron-rich nucleophilic oxygen species, like carbonyl/quinone groups, are selective to convert alkanes to olefins and inactive to catalyze the combustion of olefins during an ODH system. Therefore, limiting the generation of electrophilic oxygen species and maintaining the amount of nucleophilic oxygen species can achieve the target for higher selectivity to olefins.
Heteroatomic (boron, nitrogen and phosphorus elements) doping and modification are often used to modulate the electron density, acidity or basicity and oxygen groups on the surface of nanocarbons. Doping boron atoms into CNTs resulted in an increase of propylene at the cost of decreased reaction rate in the ODH of propane,244 showing that the presence of boron weakened the reactivity of the CNTs. The authors observed active oxygen exchange in dynamic isotope oxygen tracer experiments when using oCNT, which was significantly suppressed when using boron doped oCNT catalysts (Fig. 15a), and concluded that the incorporation of boron could inhibit the generation of peroxide and superoxide species that were responsible for both higher rate of propane conversion and its over-oxidation in the undoped oCNT catalytic system, by which the selectivity of propylene was improved dissociation of molecule oxygen and/or cover the combustion sites to increase the propylene selectivity. Similar phenomena were observed in the borate-modified nanodiamond catalytic system when used for the ODH of propane.219

The doping of electron-rich nitrogen element may generate multiple nitrogen species, among which the graphitic nitrogen was shown to play determining roles in the ODH of propane to promote the catalytic activity by reducing the apparent activation energy from 117 kJ mol1 (N-free CNT) to 111 (0.47% surface N) or 106 (0.57%) or 98 (1.44%) kJ mol1 when doped with N, and speeding up the activation of oxygen (Fig. 15b).245 This was confirmed in density functional theory (DFT) calculations which showed that the graphitic nitrogen could lower the barrier to the cleavage of the first CH bond.246
Upon the modification by phosphate,218 nanodiamond behaved similarly as in the B- and N-doped nanodiamond catalytic systems discussed above in their ability to suppress the formation of COx and improve propylene selectivity in the ODH of propane owing to the same reason, i.e. phosphate could react with the phenol groups on the nanodiamond surface and selectively block the defect sites to inhibit the production of electrophilic oxygen species (Fig. 15c).
These above-mentioned nanodiamond catalysts have their surfaces covered by sp2 carbon species. For fresh diamond which was composed of sp3 carbon atoms, fragmented products rather than a dehydrogenated one were formed in the initial stage according to an earlier comparative study of the catalytic transformation of ethylbenzene by sp3-hybridized ultra-dispersed diamond (UDD) and onion-like carbon (OLC), respectively, with benzene formed in the initial stage on the former and styrene formed on the latter.247 The analogous phase-transformation process of carbon from the sp3 to the sp2 hybridization state was also identified in the ODH of n-butane, and the authors proposed that the curved and graphitic surface might be beneficial to generate quinone groups rather than electrophilic oxygenated species, e.g. carboxylic or their anhydrides, resulting in enhanced olefin selectivity.216 The relationship between the quantity of electrophilic oxygen and side reaction rate was revealed using the iodometric titration method in ODH of n-butane, and the selectivity of C4 olefins may be improved by elimination of electrophilic oxygenated species through chemical reduction (LiAlH4 or Grignard reagents) or annealing in nitrogen.248,249
5 Comparison of the ODH catalysts
5.1 Catalytic performance
Table 2 shows the catalytic performance of typical metal-free and metal-based catalysts in ODH reactions. Metal-free carbon-based catalysts usually have lower catalytic activity than metal oxide catalysts, as demonstrated by the lower alkane conversion over the former than over the latter at similar reaction temperature (Table 2), which was attributed to the electronic properties of the center metal ion in the latter. In the ODH of propane, at low reaction temperature (400 C) highly crystalline CNTs and CNFs exhibited relatively high selectivity to propylene (4060%) at low propane conversion level (<5%). CNTs modified with boron or phosphorus oxide could enhance the oxidation resistance at a higher temperature (500 C) with the propylene selectivity maintained (40%) at the 20% conversion level. However, one deficiency that impedes the application of carbon-based catalytic systems is the low productivity of olefins which is always below 1 golefin gcat1 h1, making it hardly profitable for industrialization.

Metal-free boron-based catalysts show high catalytic activity and excellent olefin selectivity, and some of them are even higher than most metal oxide catalysts. In ODH of propane, boron nitride and silicon boride exhibited approximately 80% selectivity to propylene (90% total selectivity to propylene and ethylene) at 20% propane conversion level with propylene productivity far larger than 1 golefin gcat1 h1 over most boron-based catalysts, showing high potential for industrial implementation. This is in contrast to the relatively low propylene selectivity of less than 50% and low propylene productivity of less than 1 golefin gcat1 h1 in the ODH of propane using metal oxide catalysts at a comparable propane conversion level.
Over-oxidation of olefin products in ODH is a common problem in the metal oxide and carbonaceous catalytic systems. On metal oxide catalysts, the facile oxidation of olefin products generates a large amount of COx owing to the favorable interaction between metal sites and olefin products, resulting in a sharp decrease in olefin selectivity. As shown in Table 2, the COx could amount to 20%, and even more than 60% at the 20% propane conversion level. In carbon-based catalytic systems, the electron-withdrawing oxygenated groups on the surface of the catalysts may oxidize the electron-rich olefins, causing the rupture of the carbon skeleton to a considerable amount of COx. Surface modification to optimize these surface oxygenated groups via, e.g. surface chemical modifications (B, P) and reduction treatments (annealing, reducing reagents) have been adopted to suppress the production of COx by blocking these surface electrophilic oxygen sites.
In contrast, boron-based catalysts by their nature disfavor the oxidation of olefins as demonstrated in a control experiment39 that no measurable conversion of propylene was detected when the catalysts were fed with C3H6/O2/He under the ODH conditions, and exhibited low COx selectivity with negligible CO2 emission in the ODH of light alkanes. The total COx selectivity is less than 10% with that of CO2 lower than 1% at ca. 20% propane conversion (Table 2).
The catalytic performance of boron-based catalysts displayed dependence on their composition. In a comparative study,40 several boron-based substances (boron carbide, nickel boride, titanium boride, cobalt boride, elemental boron) showed similar product selectivity in the ODH of propane but differed in the rates of propane consumption, which may be attributed to the difference in their active site density and electronic interactions between the active site and the subsurface bulk structure.
On boron-based catalysts, the selectivity of the target olefin showed dependence on the partial pressure of reactant,203 which is in contrast to that on metal oxide catalysts37 in which the propylene selectivity correlated with the propane conversion but appeared independent on the support materials and the partial pressures of reactants in the ODH of propane. In the ODH of propane on boron-based catalysts, the selectivity of propylene increased with the partial pressure of oxygen and decreased with the propane concentration, e.g. on silicon boride catalysts.203 Similar phenomena were also observed in the ODH of isobutane and n-butane where the product selectivity changed significantly when varying the partial pressure of oxygen over the h-BN catalyst.84 This may be the consequence of the involvement of gas-phase radical reactions in the ODH reaction over boron-based catalysts which can be affected strongly by the composition of the reactants in the gas phase.
5.2 Kinetic behaviors and reaction mechanism
In the metal oxide catalytic systems, the ODH reactions follow the Marsvan Krevelen (MvK) mechanism, encompassing the CH bond activation of alkanes and the oxidation of the reduced center metal by lattice oxygen.36,243,250 It is accepted that the nucleophilic species, including metal bound oxo (MO) sites and bridging oxygen atom between metal centers (MOM), play crucial roles in abstracting the initial hydrogen atom of alkanes to olefins, while the electrophilic species such as metal bound peroxo (M-η2-O2 or MOOM) or superoxo (MO2) are responsible for the deep oxidation of olefins to carbon oxides.82,250,251 The over-oxidation product CO2 amounts to a quite high proportion of the final products, typically more than 20% and in some cases even 60% at the level of 20% propane conversion in ODH reaction.79,252257 Currently the development of precise synthesis methodology258,259 and the understanding of the reaction mechanism205,260,261 are not sufficient to offer a strategy towards acceptable olefin selectivity. There is thus an urgent need to develop applicable catalyst systems to produce olefins with high selectivity and yield under harsh oxidative conditions.
In the boron-based catalytic systems, the reaction orders of propane and dioxygen were measured to be 2 and 0.5, respectively, suggesting the activation and decomposition of dioxygen on the surface.38,39,44,45,48,171 The reported apparent activation energy of propane ranged from 150250 kJ mol1 over boron-based catalysts. On carbon-based catalysts, the reaction order with respect to propane and oxygen were measured to be 0.50.6 and 0.30.4, respectively, and the apparent activation energy of propane was 110 kJ mol1 (Fig. 15b). These intrinsically different kinetic behaviors suggest the different reaction mechanisms on boron-based and carbon-based catalysts.
Similar to that in the metal oxide catalytic system, the activation of the CH bond was considered to be the rate-determining step in both boron- and carbon-based catalytic systems.39,53 On boron-based catalysts, the dehydrogenation did not occur in the pure light alkane atmosphere, implicating that the activation of oxygen or its assistance prior to the cleavage of CH bonds of alkane is required.39,41,45,81 This is not the case on the carbon-based catalysts, and the direct dehydrogenation reaction could proceed in the absence of oxygen, suggesting that the CH bond could be activated by the oxygenated groups on the surface of the catalysts.
The boron- and carbon-based catalytic systems also differ from each other in their major by-products in the ODH of propane, which is the cracking product ethylene in the former while carbon oxides in the latter (Table 2). These results suggest that there is more significant combustion of alkanes or the over-oxidation of olefins on carbon-based catalysts. There are studies207 showing that on boron-based catalysts, the ethylene was produced from the cleavage of CC bonds of propane and the CC coupling of methyl in the gas reaction, and carbon oxides came from the electrophilic oxygenated groups on the surface of carbon-based catalysts.50,218
It is established that in the boron-based catalytic systems, the co-presence of the oxygenated boron sites, gaseous oxygen, and alkane molecule was a prerequisite to fulfill the catalytic reactions. A radical-mediated mechanism was proposed with the reaction initialized at the surface BOH sites by molecular oxygen, leading to the active surface BOOB groups (oxidation step), which then dehydrogenated alkane to produce olefin and water (reduction step). The C1 and C2 products were formed via both surface-mediated and gas-phase pathways. This hypothesis compromised most experimental observations in the h-BN catalytic system reported by various research groups.
6 Summary and perspective
The design of catalyst and the engineering of the reactor are two key components to implement the ODH protocol in industry, and the optimal synergy between them governs the success of an implementation. In recent years, the emerging metal-free boron-based catalysts represent promising alternatives for the industrialization of the ODH of light alkanes with superior selectivity toward light olefins and atom economy for valuable carbon-based products by minimizing CO2 emission, and knowledge on both fundamental and application issues is growing. In these studies, the boron-based catalysts displayed remarkable catalyst stability, superior anti-oxidation ability, and excellent thermal conductivity, and offered high productivity to light olefins (>1 golefin gcat1 h1) with established knowledge indicating that the oxygenated boron species at the edge sites or defects are responsible for the triggering of the ODH reaction of light alkanes.
The endeavors aiming at rational design and improvement of boron-based catalytic systems have been devoted to increasing the surface area and the exposure of oxygenated boron active sites. For h-BN, the edge-hydroxylation of BN, synthesis of BN with boric acid and dicyanamide, and assembly of 2D BN nanosheets into 3D ordered architectures were reported as effective ways to enhance the catalytic activity of BN. By means of similar strategies, functionalized silicon boride, supported B2O3 on high surface area SBA-15, and ordered macroporous boron phosphate were also reported with remarkable performance in the ODH of light alkanes.
The carbonaceous materials have also shown comparative catalytic performance compared to traditional metal oxide catalysts. In these catalytic systems, it has been accepted that the carbonyl/quinone groups on the surface of carbonaceous materials play important roles in activating alkane molecules. However, owing to their reductivity, the oxidative environment required in the ODH of light alkanes seems to be an obstacle hard to pass through for them, although it may be alleviated via doping of heteroatoms. In addition, the COx emission remained a significant problem due to the low stability and weak resistance against oxidation of carbonaceous materials under aerobic and high-temperature conditions. Their application is further limited by the too low olefin productivity which is below 1 golefin gcat1 h1.
There are remaining issues to address. First, detailed spectroscopic evidence of key intermediates under realistic reaction conditions is rare, which is necessary for a deep understanding of the ODH reaction at the molecular level. And extensive studies are expected to combine theoretical simulations and advanced experimental techniques, e.g. microscopic and spectroscopic methods under operando conditions, to capture the key intermediates. These studies will disclose the key issues regarding the reaction mechanism, e.g. the knowledge on the geometric and electronic characters of boron sites, the transformations of the BO and BOH groups, and the roles of the adjacent structure of oxygen-containing boron sites in the alkane ODH reactions, based on which the structureactivity relationship of the boron-based catalysts in the ODH of light alkanes may be established. Second, extensive efforts are needed to develop advanced structure-tuning strategies for more precise synthesis and functionalization of boron-based materials, and thus to enhance the activity and stability of the ODH catalysts. Previous studies have revealed that hydroxylated boron sites on boron nitride edges are decisive for the specific catalytic activity in the ODH reaction. It is beneficial for making use of this finding to improve the activity of catalysts by means of maximization of the presence of OH-containing boron sites. The third issue concerns the synergy of catalyst design and reactor engineering. The ODH is a strongly exothermic reaction which may release approximately 118 kJ mol1 energy in the ODH of propane. This suggests the potential threat from the presence of hotspots in the catalyst bed, and it is necessary to take strategies to transport timely mass and heat away from the catalyst bed. The choice of a suitable strategy requires knowledge on the behavior of the catalytic system in the reactor and the influencing factors. This calls for the close co-operation of experimental evaluation and theoretical simulation of various recipes of relevant parameters covering the composition and the morphology of the catalysts and the engineering of the reactors. The fluid dynamics simulations have been used to understand the heat flow in the reactor. In order to achieve optimal synergy of the catalyst and the reactor, advanced simulation techniques are expected to be applied to achieve more accurate understanding.
In conclusion, the boron-based ODH catalytic systems represent promising choices in industrialization owing to their high catalytic activity and intrinsic properties in suppressing over-oxidation of olefins. The carbon-based ODH catalysts provide a good test bed to extensively understand the mechanistic issues in metal-free ODH catalytic systems. The remaining issues of concern are mainly in three aspects: (1) to develop the in situ characterization and theoretical simulations under realistic reaction conditions to disclose in-depth the reaction mechanism in the boron- and carbon-based ODH catalytic systems; (2) to exploit precise synthesis strategies for promising metal-free catalysts in order to facilitate their application in industrialized ODH processes; and (3) to identify the recipe with an optimal synergy of boron-based catalyst and reactor.
