The given literature does not contain any information relevant to analyzing the structural characteristics of B-based materials with 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks or their catalytic performance. The document appears to be a citation for a scientific paper about boroxol rings in liquid and vitreous B2O3, which is not directly related to the question asked. Without additional relevant information, it is not possible to provide a meaningful answer to the question based solely on this literature.

所给文献不包含任何有关具有三维分散活性位点的多孔框架中B基材料的结构特征分析或其催化性能的相关信息。该文档似乎是一篇关于液态和玻璃态B2O3中硼氧环的科学论文引用,这与所问问题并不直接相关。在没有额外相关信息的情况下,仅凭这篇文献无法对该问题提供有意义的回答。
