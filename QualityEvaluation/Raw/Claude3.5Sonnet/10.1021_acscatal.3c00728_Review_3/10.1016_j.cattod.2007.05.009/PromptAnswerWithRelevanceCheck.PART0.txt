Read the questions and answers provided below. First, critically assess the overall relevance of the answers provided to the set of questions asked.

If, upon your assessment, you find that the answers do not contain information that is relevant to the questions asked, stop your review process immediately and respond with a single sentence: "※※※※※※※The provided answers are not relevant to the questions.※※※※※※※". Do not provide any additional explanation or background information, only this sentence should be given as a response in case of irrelevant answers.

If, however, the answers are relevant to the questions asked, proceed to compile answers for each question according to the instructions below. Ensure to aggregate all the relevant answers from the multiple answer results provided in the document, and organize them sequentially by their order number, compiling the corresponding quotes, English answers, and Chinese answers for each question.

If the provided answers' quotes are not differentiated by question, ensure to break them down and assign the quotes to each respective question, outputting them separately within each question's section.

To provide a comprehensive review, differentiate the responses into quotes, English answers, and Chinese answers for each question based on the details given in the 'Answer' XML tags. Structure your review using the XML format showcased below if the answers are relevant to the questions asked:

<EnglishVersionAnswer>

The given literature does not contain any information about B-based materials with 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks. The document primarily focuses on oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane and propane using various catalysts, mostly based on vanadium and molybdenum oxides. There is no mention of boron-containing catalysts or their structural characteristics. Therefore, this question cannot be answered based on the provided text.

</EnglishVersionAnswer>

<ChineseVersionAnswer>

所给文献中没有包含任何关于具有三维分散活性位点的多孔框架B基材料的信息。该文档主要关注使用各种催化剂(主要基于钒和钼氧化物)进行乙烷和丙烷的氧化脱氢。没有提到含硼催化剂或其结构特征。因此,无法根据提供的文本回答这个问题。
