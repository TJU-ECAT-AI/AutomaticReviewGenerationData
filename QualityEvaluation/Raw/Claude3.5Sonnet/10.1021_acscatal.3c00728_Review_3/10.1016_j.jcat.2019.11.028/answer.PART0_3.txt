[5] "During the cooling process, liquid B2O3 cools down and solidifies into nanowires covering both the inside and outside of the BPO4 hollow sphere, forming sandwich-type B2O3@BPO4 hollow spheres."

The B2O3@BPO4 material exhibits a unique 3-D dispersed active site structure within a porous framework. The sandwich-like hollow sphere structure consists of BPO4 hollow spheres covered with B2O3 nanowires both inside and outside. This structure enhances catalytic performance in several ways:

1. Increased surface area: The hollow sphere structure provides a large surface area for catalytic reactions.

2. 3-D dispersion of active sites: B2O3 nanowires cover both the inside and outside of the BPO4 hollow spheres, allowing for better dispersion and utilization of active sites.

3. Thermal stability: The melted B2O3 supported on BPO4 hollow spheres acts as a catalytically active species at high temperatures (>450°C), providing excellent stability.

4. Improved mass transfer: The hollow structure may facilitate better mass transfer during catalytic reactions.

The method used to incorporate B active components into this structure is a one-step template-free synthesis. This approach is highly effective for creating the sandwich-like hollow sphere structure, which is typically difficult to achieve at the micro/nanoscale. The method allows for the formation of BPO4 hollow spheres and the simultaneous incorporation of B2O3 nanowires on both surfaces during the cooling process.

This synthesis method is particularly effective for high-temperature catalytic applications, such as the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propene. The resulting material shows excellent productivity and stability at temperatures up to 550°C. However, the effectiveness of this method for other catalytic applications would depend on the specific reaction requirements and operating conditions.

B2O3@BPO4材料在多孔框架内展现出独特的三维分散活性位点结构。这种三明治状中空球结构由BPO4中空球组成，内外都覆盖着B2O3纳米线。这种结构通过以下几种方式增强了催化性能：

1. 增加表面积：中空球结构为催化反应提供了较大的表面积。

2. 活性位点的三维分散：B2O3纳米线覆盖在BPO4中空球的内外表面，实现了活性位点的更好分散和利用。

3. 热稳定性：在BPO4中空球表面支撑的熔融B2O3在高温下（>450°C）作为催化活性物种，提供了优异的稳定性。

4. 改善传质：中空结构可能有助于催化反应过程中的更好传质。

将B活性组分引入这种结构的方法是一步无模板合成。这种方法对于创建通常难以在微/纳米尺度实现的三明治状中空球结构非常有效。该方法允许在冷却过程中形成BPO4中空球，同时在两个表面上引入B2O3纳米线。

这种合成方法特别适用于高温催化应用，如丙烷到丙烯的氧化脱氢。所得材料在高达550°C的温度下表现出优异的生产力和稳定性。然而，这种方法对其他催化应用的有效性将取决于特定的反应要求和操作条件。
