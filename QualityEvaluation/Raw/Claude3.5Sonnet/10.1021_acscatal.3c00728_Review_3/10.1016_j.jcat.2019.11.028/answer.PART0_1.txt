The B2O3@BPO4 sandwich-like hollow spheres represent an innovative approach to creating 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks. This structure combines the advantages of homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysis, offering controllable active centers and efficient product-catalyst separation.

The key structural characteristics that enhance catalytic performance include:

1. Hollow sphere support: The BPO4 hollow spheres provide a high surface area and low density, allowing for increased loading capacity of the active B2O3 component.

2. Sandwich-like structure: B2O3 covers both the inside and outside of the BPO4 hollow spheres, maximizing the utilization of the support's surface area.

3. Liquid-phase active sites: At reaction temperatures above 450°C, the B2O3 melts, creating a supported liquid-phase catalyst. This allows for homogeneous-like catalysis with the benefits of heterogeneous support.

The method used to incorporate B active components is highly effective and innovative:

1. One-step template-free synthesis: This simple approach eliminates the need for complex template removal processes, making it more efficient than traditional methods.

2. In-situ formation: The B2O3@BPO4 structure forms during the synthesis process, with B2O3 naturally covering the BPO4 hollow spheres as they cool.

This method is particularly effective for high-temperature catalytic applications, such as the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propene. The B2O3@BPO4 catalyst shows excellent productivity and stability at 550°C, outperforming many metal-based catalysts.

The effectiveness of this approach lies in its ability to create a stable, high-surface-area catalyst that can operate at elevated temperatures while maintaining the benefits of both homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysis. This makes it particularly suitable for reactions requiring high temperatures and those that benefit from liquid-phase catalysis.

B2O3@BPO4三明治状空心球代表了在多孔框架中创建3D分散活性位点的创新方法。这种结构结合了均相和多相催化的优点，提供了可控的活性中心和高效的产物-催化剂分离。

增强催化性能的关键结构特征包括：

1. 空心球支撑：BPO4空心球提供了高比表面积和低密度，允许增加活性B2O3组分的负载容量。

2. 三明治状结构：B2O3覆盖在BPO4空心球的内外表面，最大化利用了支撑体的表面积。

3. 液相活性位点：在高于450°C的反应温度下，B2O3熔化，形成了一个负载型液相催化剂。这允许进行类似均相的催化反应，同时保持多相支撑的优势。

用于引入B活性组分的方法是高效和创新的：

1. 一步无模板合成：这种简单的方法消除了复杂的模板去除过程，比传统方法更加高效。

2. 原位形成：B2O3@BPO4结构在合成过程中形成，B2O3在冷却过程中自然覆盖在BPO4空心球上。

这种方法对于高温催化应用特别有效，例如丙烷氧化脱氢制丙烯。B2O3@BPO4催化剂在550°C下显示出优异的生产力和稳定性，优于许多金属基催化剂。

这种方法的有效性在于其能够创建一个稳定的、高比表面积的催化剂，可以在高温下操作，同时保持均相和多相催化的优点。这使得它特别适用于需要高温的反应和那些受益于液相催化的反应。
