[1] "B2O3@BPO4 sandwich-like hollow spheres were synthesized via a one-step template-free method."

[2] "At reaction temperatures (>450 C), melted B2O3 supported on the surface of BPO4 hollow spheres acts as a catalytically active species for the selective oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propene"

[3] "Commonly, the maximum utilization of the two sides of planar supports is allowed by sandwich-like structures, but sandwich-like structures are rarely used in hollow-sphere structures due to the difficulty of capsulation at micro-/nanoscale."

[4] "Herein, we present a B2O3@BPO4 composite with a sandwich-like hollow sphere structure produced using a one-step template-free method without any postprocessing. The sandwich-like B2O3 composite consists of BPO4 hollow spheres covered with B2O3 nanowires at room temperature."

[5] "During the cooling process, liquid B2O3 cools down and solidifies into nanowires covering both the inside and outside of the BPO4 hollow sphere, forming sandwich-type B2O3@BPO4 hollow spheres."

The B2O3@BPO4 material described in this study features a unique 3-D dispersed active site structure within a porous framework. The key structural characteristics include:

1. Sandwich-like hollow spheres: BPO4 hollow spheres serve as the support, with B2O3 nanowires covering both the inside and outside surfaces.

2. Template-free synthesis: The structure is produced via a one-step method without templates or post-processing.

3. High-temperature liquid phase: At reaction temperatures above 450°C, the B2O3 component melts, acting as a supported liquid-phase catalyst.

These structural features enhance catalytic performance in several ways:

1. Increased surface area: The hollow sphere structure maximizes the available surface area for catalytic reactions.

2. Improved stability: The BPO4 support stabilizes the liquid B2O3 phase at high temperatures.

3. Enhanced accessibility: The sandwich-like structure allows reactants to access active sites on both inner and outer surfaces.

4. Uniform dispersion: B2O3 nanowires provide well-dispersed active sites across the support surface.

The method used to incorporate B active components into this structure is highly effective and innovative. By utilizing a one-step, template-free synthesis, the researchers have developed a simpler and more efficient approach compared to traditional methods that often require multiple steps and template removal. This method is particularly effective for creating a sandwich-like structure in hollow spheres, which has been challenging to achieve at the micro/nanoscale.

For oxidative dehydrogenation of propane, this structure proves highly effective due to its stability at high temperatures and the ability of melted B2O3 to act as a catalytically active species. However, the effectiveness of this method for other catalytic applications would depend on the specific reaction requirements and the suitability of B2O3 as an active component.

4. 均匀分散：B2O3纳米线在支撑体表面提供了良好分散的活性位点。

将B活性组分引入这种结构的方法非常有效和创新。通过使用一步无模板合成，研究人员开发出了比传统方法更简单、更高效的方法，传统方法通常需要多个步骤和模板去除。这种方法对于在空心球中创建三明治状结构特别有效，这在微/纳米尺度上一直是具有挑战性的。

对于丙烷的氧化脱氢，由于该结构在高温下的稳定性以及熔融B2O3作为催化活性物种的能力，证明非常有效。然而，这种方法对其他催化应用的有效性将取决于特定反应要求和B2O3作为活性组分的适用性。
