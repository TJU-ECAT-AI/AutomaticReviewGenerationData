[1] "B2O3@BPO4 sandwich-like hollow spheres were synthesized via a one-step template-free method."

[2] "At reaction temperatures (>450 C), melted B2O3 supported on the surface of BPO4 hollow spheres acts as a catalytically active species for the selective oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propene, with an excellent productivity of 0.79 gC3H6 gcat1 h1 and a high stability at 550 C."

[3] "For traditional supported catalysts, to gain more active sites, hollow micro-/nanostructured materials with low density, large surface area, and high loading capacity are often used as supports"

[4] "Herein, we present a B2O3@BPO4 composite with a sandwich-like hollow sphere structure produced using a one-step template-free method without any postprocessing. The sandwich-like B2O3 composite consists of BPO4 hollow spheres covered with B2O3 nanowires at room temperature."

The B2O3@BPO4 material features a unique 3-D dispersed active site structure within a porous framework. The sandwich-like hollow spheres consist of BPO4 hollow spheres covered with B2O3 nanowires both inside and outside. This structure enhances catalytic performance in several ways:

1. High surface area and loading capacity due to the hollow sphere morphology
2. Efficient utilization of both inner and outer surfaces of the hollow spheres
3. Melted B2O3 at high temperatures acts as a supported liquid-phase catalyst, combining benefits of homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysis

The one-step template-free synthesis method is highly effective for incorporating the B active components into this structure. It allows for the simultaneous formation of the BPO4 hollow spheres and deposition of B2O3 nanowires without requiring additional processing steps or templates. This approach is particularly well-suited for high-temperature catalytic applications, such as the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane, where the melted B2O3 can function as an active liquid-phase catalyst supported on the thermally stable BPO4 framework.

Compared to traditional methods of incorporating B into porous frameworks, this approach offers several advantages:
1. Simplicity of synthesis
2. No need for template removal
3. Formation of a unique sandwich-like structure that maximizes active site accessibility
4. Ability to function as a supported liquid-phase catalyst at high temperatures

While this method is highly effective for the demonstrated catalytic application, its applicability to other reactions may depend on the specific temperature requirements and chemical compatibility of the B2O3-BPO4 system with different reactants.

B2O3@BPO4材料在多孔框架中具有独特的三维分散活性位点结构。这种三明治状的空心球由BPO4空心球组成，内外都覆盖着B2O3纳米线。这种结构通过以下几种方式提高了催化性能：

1. 由于空心球形态，具有高比表面积和高载荷能力
2. 高效利用空心球的内外表面
3. 高温下熔融的B2O3作为支持的液相催化剂，结合了均相和多相催化的优点

一步法无模板合成方法对于将B活性组分引入这种结构非常有效。它允许同时形成BPO4空心球和沉积B2O3纳米线，无需额外的处理步骤或模板。这种方法特别适用于高温催化应用，如丙烷的氧化脱氢，其中熔融的B2O3可以作为活性液相催化剂，支持在热稳定的BPO4框架上。

与传统的将B引入多孔框架的方法相比，这种方法具有以下几个优点：
1. 合成简单
2. 无需去除模板
3. 形成独特的三明治状结构，最大化活性位点的可及性
4. 能够在高温下作为支持的液相催化剂发挥作用

虽然这种方法对所展示的催化应用非常有效，但其对其他反应的适用性可能取决于特定的温度要求和B2O3-BPO4系统与不同反应物的化学兼容性。
