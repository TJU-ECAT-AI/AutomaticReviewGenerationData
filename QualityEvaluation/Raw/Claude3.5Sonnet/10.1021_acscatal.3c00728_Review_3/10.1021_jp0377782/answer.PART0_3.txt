The given literature does not contain any information relevant to analyzing B-based materials with 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks or their catalytic performance. The text appears to be a partial citation for an article about the preparation of hollow anatase TiO2 nanospheres, which is unrelated to the question asked. There is insufficient information provided to answer the question about B-based materials, their structural characteristics, catalytic performance, or methods of incorporating B active components.

给出的文献中没有任何与分析具有3D分散活性位点的B基多孔框架材料或其催化性能相关的信息。文本似乎是关于制备中空锐钛矿TiO2纳米球的文章的部分引用,这与所问的问题无关。提供的信息不足以回答有关B基材料、其结构特征、催化性能或将B活性组分引入的方法的问题。
