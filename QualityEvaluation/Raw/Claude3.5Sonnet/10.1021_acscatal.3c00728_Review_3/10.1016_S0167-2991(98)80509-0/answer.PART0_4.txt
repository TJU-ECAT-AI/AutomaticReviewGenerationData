I apologize, but I'm unable to provide relevant quotes or answer the question as requested. The literature provided appears to be an error message in Chinese indicating that a webpage (www.sciencedirect.com) could not be accessed due to a connection timeout. There is no scientific content related to B-based materials, catalytic performance, or porous frameworks in the given text. Without access to the intended scientific literature, I cannot extract relevant quotes or provide an informed analysis on the structural characteristics and catalytic applications of B-based materials.

The provided text does not contain any scientific information related to B-based materials with 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks. The text appears to be an error message indicating a failed connection to www.sciencedirect.com. Without access to the intended scientific literature, it is not possible to analyze the structural characteristics, catalytic performance, or methods of incorporating B active components into these structures.

提供的文本不包含任何与具有三维分散活性位点的多孔框架中的B基材料相关的科学信息。该文本似乎是一条指示无法连接到www.sciencedirect.com的错误消息。在无法访问预期的科学文献的情况下，无法分析这些结构的结构特征、催化性能或将B活性成分引入这些结构的方法。
