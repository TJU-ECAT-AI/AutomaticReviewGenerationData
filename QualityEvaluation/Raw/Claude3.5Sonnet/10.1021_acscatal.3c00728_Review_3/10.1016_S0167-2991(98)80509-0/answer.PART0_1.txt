I apologize, but I'm unable to provide relevant quotes or answer the question based on the given literature. The content provided appears to be an error message in Chinese indicating that a webpage could not be accessed, rather than scientific literature about B-based materials and catalysis. Without access to the intended scientific content, I cannot extract relevant quotes or provide an informed analysis of the structural characteristics, catalytic performance, or methods for incorporating B active components as requested in the question.
