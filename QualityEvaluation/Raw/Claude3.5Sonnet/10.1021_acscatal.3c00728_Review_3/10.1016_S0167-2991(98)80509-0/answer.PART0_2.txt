I apologize, but I am unable to provide relevant quotes or answer the question based on the given literature. The content provided appears to be an error message in Chinese indicating that a webpage could not be accessed, rather than scientific literature about B-based materials and catalytic performance. Without access to the intended scientific literature, I cannot extract relevant quotes or provide an informed analysis of the structural characteristics, catalytic performance, or methods for incorporating B active components as requested in the question. I would need the actual scientific literature to properly address the question.

The question cannot be answered based on the provided document. The literature section contains an error message about a webpage failing to load, rather than scientific content about B-based materials and catalysis. Without access to the intended scientific literature, it is not possible to analyze the structural characteristics, catalytic performance enhancements, or methods for incorporating B active components as requested.

基于提供的文档无法回答该问题。文献部分包含的是一个网页加载失败的错误信息,而不是关于B基材料和催化作用的科学内容。没有获取到预期的科学文献,无法按要求分析结构特征、催化性能增强或B活性组分的引入方法。
