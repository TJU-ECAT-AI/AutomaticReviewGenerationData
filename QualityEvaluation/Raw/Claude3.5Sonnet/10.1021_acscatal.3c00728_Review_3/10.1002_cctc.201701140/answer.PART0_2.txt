[1] "Aside from BN, we now show that the boron-containing materials boron carbide (B4C), titanium boride (TiB2), nickel boride (NiB), cobalt boride (Co2B/Co3B), hafnium boride (HfB2), and tungsten boride (WB) all catalyze the ODHP reaction and show identical trends in their product distributions (Figure1)."

[2] "The various B-containing materials differ in their catalytic performance only in the rates of propane consumption (Figure2). Of the boron-containing catalysts tested, B4C and WB are the most and least reactive, respectively, and they differ in their specific rates of propane consumption per gram of catalyst by a factor of approximately 5."

[3] "As was previously observed,7 the rate of propane consumption does not scale with the surface area of the boron-containing catalyst (Table1), and disparities are more likely as a result of differences in the active-site densities and/or the electronic interactions between the catalyst surface and the bulk structure."

[4] "Along these lines, the extent of the oxidation of the surfaces of these boron materials and, thus, the active-site density may be influenced by the crystal structure of the material (TableS1 shows the crystal structures of the tested boride catalysts). Layered borides (e.g., NiB, TiB2, hBN) could present different boron surface concentrations than tetragonal borides (e.g., WB, Co2B), which would thus affect the formation of BOx species during ODH."

The literature does not specifically discuss B-based materials with 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks. Instead, it focuses on various boron-containing materials and their performance in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reaction.

The study examines different boron-containing materials such as boron carbide (B4C), titanium boride (TiB2), nickel boride (NiB), cobalt boride (Co2B/Co3B), hafnium boride (HfB2), and tungsten boride (WB). These materials show similar catalytic behavior in the ODHP reaction, differing mainly in their rates of propane consumption.

The catalytic performance of these materials does not directly correlate with their surface area. Instead, the differences in reactivity are attributed to variations in active-site densities and electronic interactions between the catalyst surface and the bulk structure.

The crystal structure of the boron materials is suggested to influence the extent of surface oxidation and, consequently, the active-site density. Layered borides (e.g., NiB, TiB2, hBN) may have different boron surface concentrations compared to tetragonal borides (e.g., WB, Co2B), which could affect the formation of BOx species during the ODH reaction.

However, the literature does not provide specific information on methods to incorporate B active components into 3-D dispersed structures or porous frameworks. It also does not discuss the relative effectiveness of these materials for different catalytic applications beyond the ODHP reaction.

该文献并未特别讨论具有3-D分散活性位点的多孔框架B基材料。相反，它主要关注各种含硼材料及其在丙烷氧化脱氢(ODHP)反应中的性能。

研究考察了不同的含硼材料，如碳化硼(B4C)、硼化钛(TiB2)、硼化镍(NiB)、硼化钴(Co2B/Co3B)、硼化铪(HfB2)和硼化钨(WB)。这些材料在ODHP反应中表现出相似的催化行为，主要区别在于它们的丙烷消耗速率。

这些材料的催化性能与它们的表面积并不直接相关。相反，反应性的差异被归因于活性位点密度的变化以及催化剂表面与体相结构之间的电子相互作用。

硼材料的晶体结构被认为会影响表面氧化的程度，从而影响活性位点密度。层状硼化物（如NiB、TiB2、hBN）可能具有与四方硼化物（如WB、Co2B）不同的硼表面浓度，这可能会影响ODH反应过程中BOx物种的形成。

然而，该文献并未提供将B活性组分incorporation到3-D分散结构或多孔框架中的具体方法。它也没有讨论这些材料在ODHP反应之外的其他催化应用中的相对效果。
