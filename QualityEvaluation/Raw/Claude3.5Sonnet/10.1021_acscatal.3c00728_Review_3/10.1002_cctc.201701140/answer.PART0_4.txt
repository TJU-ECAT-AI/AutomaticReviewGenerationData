[1] "Boron nitride was recently identified as a highly selective catalyst for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane."

[2] "We recently reported that boron nitride (BN) materials, both hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) and boron nitride nanotubes (BNNTs), catalyzed the ODH of propane (ODHP),"

[3] "Aside from BN, we now show that the boron-containing materials boron carbide (B4C), titanium boride (TiB2), nickel boride (NiB), cobalt boride (Co2B/Co3B), hafnium boride (HfB2), and tungsten boride (WB) all catalyze the ODHP reaction and show identical trends in their product distributions"

[4] "The various B-containing materials differ in their catalytic performance only in the rates of propane consumption"

[5] "To elucidate further the role of boron as the element responsible for the ODH activity and to decouple the influence of the non-boron constituent element within the tested materials, the catalytic activity of elemental boron was also evaluated."

The literature does not provide specific information about B-based materials with 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks. The study focuses on various boron-containing compounds and elemental boron as catalysts for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP), but does not discuss 3-D porous structures or methods to incorporate B active components into such frameworks.

The research shows that different boron-containing materials, including boron nitride (BN), boron carbide (B4C), and various metal borides, as well as elemental boron, can catalyze the ODHP reaction. These materials demonstrate similar product distributions but differ in their rates of propane consumption. However, the study does not analyze the structural characteristics of these materials in terms of 3-D dispersed active sites or porous frameworks.

The methods used to incorporate B active components are not explicitly discussed in the literature. Instead, the research focuses on testing existing boron-containing compounds and elemental boron for their catalytic performance in the ODHP reaction.

Given the limited information provided in the literature about 3-D porous structures and methods of incorporating B active components, it is not possible to critically evaluate their effectiveness for different catalytic applications based on this text alone.

该文献没有提供关于具有三维分散活性位点的多孔框架中的B基材料的具体信息。该研究主要关注各种含硼化合物和元素硼作为丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）的催化剂，但没有讨论三维多孔结构或将B活性组分引入这种框架的方法。

研究表明，不同的含硼材料，包括氮化硼（BN）、碳化硼（B4C）和各种金属硼化物，以及元素硼，都可以催化ODHP反应。这些材料表现出相似的产物分布，但在丙烷消耗速率上有所不同。然而，该研究并未从三维分散活性位点或多孔框架的角度分析这些材料的结构特征。

文献中并未明确讨论引入B活性组分的方法。相反，研究重点是测试现有的含硼化合物和元素硼在ODHP反应中的催化性能。

鉴于文献中关于三维多孔结构和引入B活性组分方法的信息有限，仅基于此文本无法对它们在不同催化应用中的有效性进行批判性评估。
