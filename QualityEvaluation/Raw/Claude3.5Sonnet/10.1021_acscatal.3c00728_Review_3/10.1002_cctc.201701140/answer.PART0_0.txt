[1] "We recently reported that boron nitride (BN) materials, both hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) and boron nitride nanotubes (BNNTs), catalyzed the ODH of propane (ODHP),"

[2] "Aside from BN, we now show that the boron-containing materials boron carbide (B4C), titanium boride (TiB2), nickel boride (NiB), cobalt boride (Co2B/Co3B), hafnium boride (HfB2), and tungsten boride (WB) all catalyze the ODHP reaction and show identical trends in their product distributions"

[3] "The various B-containing materials differ in their catalytic performance only in the rates of propane consumption"

[4] "To elucidate further the role of boron as the element responsible for the ODH activity and to decouple the influence of the non-boron constituent element within the tested materials, the catalytic activity of elemental boron was also evaluated."

[5] "Along these lines, the extent of the oxidation of the surfaces of these boron materials and, thus, the active-site density may be influenced by the crystal structure of the material"

The literature does not provide a comprehensive analysis of 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks for B-based materials. Instead, it focuses on various boron-containing compounds and elemental boron as catalysts for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP).

The study examines different boron-containing materials such as boron nitride (BN), boron carbide (B4C), and various metal borides. These materials show similar catalytic behavior in ODHP reactions, with differences mainly in their rates of propane consumption. This suggests that the boron component is primarily responsible for the catalytic activity, rather than the specific 3-D structure or porosity.

The research does not directly discuss methods for incorporating B active components into porous frameworks. Instead, it evaluates the performance of various pre-existing boron compounds and elemental boron. The study suggests that the crystal structure of the boron materials may influence the oxidation of their surfaces and thus the density of active sites, but it does not provide detailed information on how to engineer these structures for enhanced catalytic performance.

In terms of effectiveness for different catalytic applications, the study focuses specifically on ODHP reactions. It does not provide comparative information on the effectiveness of these materials for other catalytic applications.

Overall, while the study provides valuable insights into the catalytic behavior of various boron-containing materials, it does not directly address the question of 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks or methods for incorporating boron into such structures.

这篇文献并没有对具有三维分散活性位点的多孔框架B基材料进行全面分析。相反，它主要关注各种含硼化合物和元素硼作为丙烷氧化脱氢(ODHP)的催化剂。

研究考察了不同的含硼材料，如氮化硼(BN)、碳化硼(B4C)和各种金属硼化物。这些材料在ODHP反应中表现出相似的催化行为，主要差异在于它们的丙烷消耗速率。这表明硼组分是催化活性的主要负责者，而不是特定的三维结构或多孔性。

研究并未直接讨论将B活性组分引入多孔框架的方法。相反，它评估了各种现有硼化合物和元素硼的性能。研究表明，硼材料的晶体结构可能会影响其表面的氧化程度，从而影响活性位点的密度，但并未提供如何设计这些结构以增强催化性能的详细信息。

在对不同催化应用的有效性方面，研究主要集中在ODHP反应上。它没有提供这些材料在其他催化应用中的有效性比较信息。

总的来说，虽然这项研究为各种含硼材料的催化行为提供了宝贵的见解，但它并未直接解答关于多孔框架中三维分散活性位点的问题，也没有讨论将硼引入此类结构的方法。
