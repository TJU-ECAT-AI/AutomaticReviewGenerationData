The structural characteristics of B-based materials with 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks include:

1. Highly dispersed boron and oxygen throughout the carbon nanotube (CNT) substrate.
2. Stability under reaction conditions.
3. Majority of amorphous B2O3 deposited in the cavity and on the tips of CNTs.
4. Minor fraction of outer CNT surface covered by an amorphous coating of about 1-2 nm thickness.
5. Highly dispersed sub-monolayer deposition of BOx species omnipresent on the surface.
6. Covalent bonding of doped samples to the CNT structure.
7. B2O3 filling of CNTs acts as a backbone against oxidation.

These structural features enhance catalytic performance by:

3. Inhibiting the dissociative adsorption of O2, sustaining selective oxygen species on the catalyst surface.
4. Increasing propene selectivity while maintaining high activity.

The method used to incorporate B active components into these structures is incipient wetness impregnation. This method involves using aqueous solutions of (NH4)2B10O16·8H2O to achieve loadings between 0.003 and 5 wt% B2O3. The effectiveness of this method for catalytic applications in oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of propane is demonstrated by:

1. Improved propene selectivity compared to unmodified CNTs.
2. Tunable balance between activity loss and selectivity gain by controlling the amount of boron dopant.
3. Significant effect observed even at very low loadings (0.003 wt%).
4. Stable performance under reaction conditions.

While this method is effective for ODH of propane, its relative effectiveness for other catalytic applications is not discussed in the given literature. Further research would be needed to evaluate its suitability for different catalytic processes.

The structural characteristics of B-based materials with 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks include:

1. High dispersion of boron and oxygen throughout the carbon nanotube (CNT) substrate.
2. Stability of the B-CNT composite under reaction conditions.
3. A thin amorphous coating (1-2 nm) on a minor fraction of the outer CNT surface.
4. Highly dispersed sub-monolayer deposition of BOx species, filling surface defects and holes in graphene layers.

These features enhance catalytic performance by:

1. Providing a large number of accessible active sites.
2. Maintaining catalyst stability during reactions.
3. Modifying the surface properties of CNTs to improve selectivity.
4. Inhibiting dissociative adsorption of O2, leading to more selective oxygen species on the catalyst surface.

The method used to incorporate B active components into these structures is incipient wetness impregnation using aqueous solutions of (NH4)2B10O16·8H2O. This method is effective for creating a highly dispersed boron oxide layer on CNTs. However, it has some limitations:

1. Initial deactivation due to decomposition or thermal spreading of the deposited B2O3 precursor.
2. Potential non-uniform distribution of boron oxide, with more deposition in the cavity and on the tips of CNTs.

The effectiveness of this method for different catalytic applications depends on the desired boron loading and the specific reaction conditions. For oxidative dehydrogenation of propane, even very low loadings (0.003 wt%) showed improved selectivity, indicating high effectiveness. However, for applications requiring higher boron loadings or more uniform distribution, alternative methods might be more suitable.

基于B的材料在多孔框架中具有3-D分散活性位点的结构特征包括：

1. 硼和氧在碳纳米管（CNT）基质中高度分散。
2. B-CNT复合材料在反应条件下稳定。
3. 在外部CNT表面的一小部分上有薄的非晶涂层（1-2 nm）。
4. 高度分散的亚单层BOx物种沉积，填充石墨烯层中的表面缺陷和孔隙。

这些特征通过以下方式增强催化性能：

1. 提供大量可接近的活性位点。
2. 在反应过程中保持催化剂稳定性。
3. 修改CNT的表面性质以提高选择性。
4. 抑制O2的解离吸附，导致催化剂表面上更具选择性的氧物种。

将B活性组分结合到这些结构中的方法是使用(NH4)2B10O16·8H2O水溶液进行浸渍。这种方法对于在CNT上创建高度分散的氧化硼层是有效的。然而，它有一些局限性：

1. 由于沉积的B2O3前体分解或热扩散，初始会出现轻微失活。
2. 氧化硼可能分布不均匀，在CNT的腔体和尖端处沉积更多。

这种方法对不同催化应用的有效性取决于所需的硼负载量和特定的反应条件。对于丙烷的氧化脱氢，即使是非常低的负载量（0.003 wt%）也显示出改善的选择性，表明高度有效。然而，对于需要更高硼负载量或更均匀分布的应用，其他方法可能更合适。

The structural characteristics of B-based materials with 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks include:

1. High dispersion of boron and oxygen throughout the carbon nanotube (CNT) substrate.
2. Deposition of amorphous B2O3 primarily in the cavity and on the tips of CNTs.
3. A thin amorphous coating (1-2 nm) on a minor fraction of the outer CNT surface.
4. Highly dispersed sub-monolayer deposition of BOx species filling surface defects and holes in graphene layers.

The main method used to incorporate B active components into these structures is incipient wetness impregnation using aqueous solutions of (NH4)2B10O16·8H2O. This method is effective for achieving uniform dispersion of boron oxide throughout the CNT structure and allows for precise control of B2O3 loading (between 0.003 and 5 wt%).

The effectiveness of this method for different catalytic applications can be evaluated based on:

1. Its ability to create a highly dispersed and stable boron oxide coating on CNTs.
2. The flexibility in controlling B2O3 loading, allowing for optimization of catalytic performance.
3. The successful enhancement of propene selectivity in oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) reactions.

However, the method's effectiveness may be limited by:

1. The potential for non-uniform distribution of B2O3 in larger-scale applications.
2. Possible agglomeration of B2O3 particles at higher loadings.
3. The need for further optimization to increase overall catalytic activity while maintaining high selectivity.

In conclusion, while the incipient wetness impregnation method has shown promising results for incorporating boron into CNT structures for ODH reactions, further research may be needed to optimize its effectiveness for other catalytic applications and larger-scale production.

The B-based materials discussed in this study feature highly dispersed boron and oxygen throughout the carbon nanotube (CNT) substrate, creating a 3-D network of active sites within the porous CNT framework. This structural characteristic enhances catalytic performance in several ways:

1. Improved selectivity: The dispersed boron oxide acts as an electron-deficient promoter, inhibiting the dissociative adsorption of O2 and maintaining selective oxygen species on the catalyst surface. This leads to enhanced propene selectivity in the oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of propane.

2. Suppressed total combustion: The modification with boron oxide blocks combustion sites, reducing unwanted total oxidation reactions and improving overall selectivity towards the desired product.

3. Increased stability: The presence of boron oxide increases the catalyst's resistance to oxidation, improving its stability under reaction conditions.

The method used to incorporate B active components into these structures is incipient wetness impregnation. This technique involves using aqueous solutions of boron precursors (specifically (NH4)2B10O168H2O) to achieve loadings between 0.003 and 5 wt% B2O3. This method proves effective for several reasons:

1. High dispersion: The technique allows for a highly dispersed distribution of boron and oxygen throughout the CNT substrate.

2. Versatility: It enables precise control over the boron loading, allowing for optimization of catalytic performance.

3. Targeted deposition: The majority of amorphous B2O3 is deposited in the cavity and on the tips of CNTs, with only a minor fraction covering the outer CNT surface.

4. Defect filling: The process results in a highly dispersed sub-monolayer deposition of BOx species, which can fill surface defects and holes in the graphene layers, potentially improving the overall stability of the structure.

This method of boron incorporation is particularly effective for ODH reactions, as demonstrated by the improved selectivity and stability of the B-modified CNT catalysts in propane dehydrogenation. However, its effectiveness for other catalytic applications would depend on the specific reaction requirements and the desired role of boron in the catalytic process.

本研究中讨论的B基材料在碳纳米管（CNT）基质中具有高度分散的硼和氧，在多孔CNT框架内形成了三维活性位点网络。这种结构特征通过以下几种方式增强了催化性能：

1. 提高选择性：分散的氧化硼作为电子缺乏的促进剂，抑制O2的解离吸附，并在催化剂表面维持选择性氧物种。这导致了丙烷氧化脱氢（ODH）反应中丙烯选择性的提高。

2. 抑制完全燃烧：氧化硼的修饰阻断了燃烧位点，减少了不需要的完全氧化反应，提高了对目标产物的整体选择性。

3. 增加稳定性：氧化硼的存在增加了催化剂对氧化的抗性，提高了其在反应条件下的稳定性。

将B活性组分引入这些结构的方法是等体积浸渍法。这种技术涉及使用硼前体的水溶液（具体是(NH4)2B10O168H2O），以达到0.003至5 wt% B2O3的负载。这种方法之所以有效，有以下几个原因：

1. 高度分散：该技术允许硼和氧在CNT基质中高度分散分布。

2. 多样性：它能够精确控制硼的负载量，从而优化催化性能。

3. 定向沉积：大部分无定形B2O3沉积在CNT的空腔和尖端，只有少量覆盖在CNT的外表面。

4. 缺陷填充：该过程导致BOx物种的高度分散亚单层沉积，可以填充石墨烯层中的表面缺陷和孔洞，潜在地提高了结构的整体稳定性。

这种硼掺入方法对ODH反应特别有效，这从B修饰的CNT催化剂在丙烷脱氢反应中选择性和稳定性的提高可以看出。然而，对于其他催化应用的有效性将取决于特定的反应要求和硼在催化过程中所需扮演的角色。

1. Highly dispersed boron and oxygen throughout the carbon nanotube (CNT) substrate.
2. A sub-monolayer deposition of BOx species filling surface defects and holes in the graphene layers.
3. Minimal amorphous coating (1-2 nm thickness) on the outer CNT surface.
4. Covalent bonding of boron to the CNT structure.
5. B2O3 filling the CNTs, acting as a backbone against oxidation.

These structural features enhance catalytic performance by:

This method is effective for achieving precise loadings of B2O3 (0.003 to 5 wt%) and allows for uniform dispersion throughout the CNT structure.

The effectiveness of this incorporation method for different catalytic applications can be critically evaluated:

1. It is highly effective for oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) reactions, particularly for light alkanes like propane, where it significantly improves selectivity towards alkene formation.
2. The method allows for fine-tuning of the B2O3 loading, which is crucial for optimizing the balance between activity and selectivity in ODH reactions.
3. The high dispersion achieved helps in suppressing total oxidation reactions, making it particularly useful for selective oxidation processes.
4. The thermal stability imparted by this method makes the catalysts suitable for high-temperature applications.
5. However, the initial deactivation observed due to decomposition or thermal spreading of the B2O3 precursor suggests that further optimization of the incorporation method may be needed for some applications.

Overall, while this incorporation method is highly effective for ODH reactions and selective oxidation processes, its effectiveness for other catalytic applications would need to be evaluated on a case-by-case basis, considering factors such as reaction conditions, desired selectivity, and stability requirements.
