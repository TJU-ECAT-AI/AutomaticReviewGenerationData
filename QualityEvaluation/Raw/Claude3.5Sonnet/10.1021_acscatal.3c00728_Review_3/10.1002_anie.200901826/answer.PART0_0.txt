[1] "Energy-filtered transmission electron microscopy (EF-TEM) shows that both boron and oxygen are highly dispersed throughout the CNT substrate"

[2] "The composite is stable under reaction conditions, and all of the B2O3 (1.7atom% B for 5B-oCNT) could be detected by electron energy-loss spectroscopy (EELS) after use in ODH"

[3] "Owing to the chosen preparation method, the majority of amorphous B2O3 is deposited in the cavity and on the tips of CNTs. Only a minor fraction of the outer CNT surface is covered by an amorphous coating of about 12nm thickness, whereas a highly dispersed sub-monolayer deposition of BOx species is expected to be omnipresent"

[4] "The good thermal stability of the doped samples during TPO indicates a covalent bonding to the CNT structure, whereas the B2O3/P2O5 filling of the CNTs acts as a backbone against oxidation."

[5] "B- and P-modified samples were prepared by incipient wetness impregnation of oCNTs (6mLg1) using aqueous solutions of (NH4)2B10O168H2O and (NH4)2HPO4 (Sigma Aldrich, >99%), to achieve loadings of between x=0.003 and 5wt% B2O3 or 5wt% P2O5."

The structural characteristics of B-based materials with 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks include:

1. Highly dispersed boron and oxygen throughout the carbon nanotube (CNT) substrate.
2. Stability under reaction conditions.
3. Majority of amorphous B2O3 deposited in the cavity and on the tips of CNTs.
4. Minor fraction of outer CNT surface covered by an amorphous coating of about 1-2 nm thickness.
5. Highly dispersed sub-monolayer deposition of BOx species omnipresent on the surface.
6. Covalent bonding of doped samples to the CNT structure.
7. B2O3 filling of CNTs acts as a backbone against oxidation.

These structural features enhance catalytic performance by:

1. Improving chemical stability and resistance to oxidation.
2. Blocking combustion sites and suppressing total oxidation reactions.
3. Inhibiting the dissociative adsorption of O2, sustaining selective oxygen species on the catalyst surface.
4. Increasing propene selectivity while maintaining high activity.

The method used to incorporate B active components into these structures is incipient wetness impregnation. This method involves using aqueous solutions of (NH4)2B10O16·8H2O to achieve loadings between 0.003 and 5 wt% B2O3. The effectiveness of this method for catalytic applications in oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of propane is demonstrated by:

1. Improved propene selectivity compared to unmodified CNTs.
2. Tunable balance between activity loss and selectivity gain by controlling the amount of boron dopant.
3. Significant effect observed even at very low loadings (0.003 wt%).
4. Stable performance under reaction conditions.

While this method is effective for ODH of propane, its relative effectiveness for other catalytic applications is not discussed in the given literature. Further research would be needed to evaluate its suitability for different catalytic processes.

基于B的材料在多孔框架中具有3-D分散活性位点的结构特征包括：

1. 硼和氧在碳纳米管（CNT）基质中高度分散。
2. 在反应条件下保持稳定。
3. 大部分无定形B2O3沉积在CNT的腔体和尖端。
4. CNT外表面的少部分被约1-2纳米厚的无定形涂层覆盖。
5. BOx物种的高度分散亚单层沉积无处不在。
6. 掺杂样品与CNT结构共价键合。
7. CNT中的B2O3填充物作为抗氧化的骨架。

这些结构特征通过以下方式增强催化性能：

1. 提高化学稳定性和抗氧化能力。
2. 阻塞燃烧位点并抑制总氧化反应。
3. 抑制O2的解离吸附，维持催化剂表面上的选择性氧物种。
4. 提高丙烯选择性，同时保持高活性。

将B活性组分引入这些结构的方法是浸渍法。这种方法涉及使用(NH4)2B10O16·8H2O的水溶液，以实现0.003至5 wt%的B2O3负载。这种方法在丙烷氧化脱氢（ODH）催化应用中的有效性通过以下方面得到证明：

1. 与未改性CNT相比，丙烯选择性提高。
2. 通过控制硼掺杂量，可以调节活性损失和选择性增益之间的平衡。
3. 即使在很低的负载量（0.003 wt%）下也观察到显著效果。
4. 在反应条件下性能稳定。

虽然这种方法对丙烷的ODH有效，但给定文献中没有讨论它对其他催化应用的相对有效性。需要进一步研究来评估其对不同催化过程的适用性。
