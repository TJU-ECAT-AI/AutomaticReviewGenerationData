[1] "Energy-filtered transmission electron microscopy (EF-TEM) shows that both boron and oxygen are highly dispersed throughout the CNT substrate"

[2] "Apart from the suppressed total combustion reaction on the modified CNTs, a further reason for enhanced propene selectivity may also be the lower reoxidation capacity of active sites. Boron oxide as an electron-deficient promoter tends to inhibit the dissociative adsorption of O2 and thus sustains the selective oxygen species on the catalyst surface."

[3] "Owing to the chosen preparation method, the majority of amorphous B2O3 is deposited in the cavity and on the tips of CNTs. Only a minor fraction of the outer CNT surface is covered by an amorphous coating of about 12nm thickness, whereas a highly dispersed sub-monolayer deposition of BOx species is expected to be omnipresent, as the reduced surface area of modified CNTs may also be interpreted as the filling of surface defects and holes in the graphene layers."

[4] "B- and P-modified samples were prepared by incipient wetness impregnation of oCNTs (6mLg1) using aqueous solutions of (NH4)2B10O168H2O and (NH4)2HPO4 (Sigma Aldrich, >99%), to achieve loadings of between x=0.003 and 5wt% B2O3 or 5wt% P2O5."

The B-based materials discussed in this study feature highly dispersed boron and oxygen throughout the carbon nanotube (CNT) substrate, creating a 3-D network of active sites within the porous CNT framework. This structural characteristic enhances catalytic performance in several ways:

1. Improved selectivity: The dispersed boron oxide acts as an electron-deficient promoter, inhibiting the dissociative adsorption of O2 and maintaining selective oxygen species on the catalyst surface. This leads to enhanced propene selectivity in the oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of propane.

2. Suppressed total combustion: The modification with boron oxide blocks combustion sites, reducing unwanted total oxidation reactions and improving overall selectivity towards the desired product.

3. Increased stability: The presence of boron oxide increases the catalyst's resistance to oxidation, improving its stability under reaction conditions.

The method used to incorporate B active components into these structures is incipient wetness impregnation. This technique involves using aqueous solutions of boron precursors (specifically (NH4)2B10O168H2O) to achieve loadings between 0.003 and 5 wt% B2O3. This method proves effective for several reasons:

1. High dispersion: The technique allows for a highly dispersed distribution of boron and oxygen throughout the CNT substrate.

2. Versatility: It enables precise control over the boron loading, allowing for optimization of catalytic performance.

3. Targeted deposition: The majority of amorphous B2O3 is deposited in the cavity and on the tips of CNTs, with only a minor fraction covering the outer CNT surface.

4. Defect filling: The process results in a highly dispersed sub-monolayer deposition of BOx species, which can fill surface defects and holes in the graphene layers, potentially improving the overall stability of the structure.

This method of boron incorporation is particularly effective for ODH reactions, as demonstrated by the improved selectivity and stability of the B-modified CNT catalysts in propane dehydrogenation. However, its effectiveness for other catalytic applications would depend on the specific reaction requirements and the desired role of boron in the catalytic process.

本研究中讨论的B基材料在碳纳米管（CNT）基质中具有高度分散的硼和氧，在多孔CNT框架内形成了三维活性位点网络。这种结构特征通过以下几种方式增强了催化性能：

1. 提高选择性：分散的氧化硼作为电子缺乏的促进剂，抑制O2的解离吸附，并在催化剂表面维持选择性氧物种。这导致了丙烷氧化脱氢（ODH）反应中丙烯选择性的提高。

2. 抑制完全燃烧：氧化硼的修饰阻断了燃烧位点，减少了不需要的完全氧化反应，提高了对目标产物的整体选择性。

3. 增加稳定性：氧化硼的存在增加了催化剂对氧化的抗性，提高了其在反应条件下的稳定性。

将B活性组分引入这些结构的方法是等体积浸渍法。这种技术涉及使用硼前体的水溶液（具体是(NH4)2B10O168H2O），以达到0.003至5 wt% B2O3的负载。这种方法之所以有效，有以下几个原因：

1. 高度分散：该技术允许硼和氧在CNT基质中高度分散分布。

2. 多样性：它能够精确控制硼的负载量，从而优化催化性能。

3. 定向沉积：大部分无定形B2O3沉积在CNT的空腔和尖端，只有少量覆盖在CNT的外表面。

4. 缺陷填充：该过程导致BOx物种的高度分散亚单层沉积，可以填充石墨烯层中的表面缺陷和孔洞，潜在地提高了结构的整体稳定性。

这种硼掺入方法对ODH反应特别有效，这从B修饰的CNT催化剂在丙烷脱氢反应中选择性和稳定性的提高可以看出。然而，对于其他催化应用的有效性将取决于特定的反应要求和硼在催化过程中所需扮演的角色。
