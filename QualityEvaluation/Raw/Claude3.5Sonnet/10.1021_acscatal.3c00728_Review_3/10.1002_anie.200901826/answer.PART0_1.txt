[1] "Energy-filtered transmission electron microscopy (EF-TEM) shows that both boron and oxygen are highly dispersed throughout the CNT substrate"

[2] "The composite is stable under reaction conditions, and all of the B2O3 (1.7atom% B for 5B-oCNT) could be detected by electron energy-loss spectroscopy (EELS) after use in ODH"

[3] "Only a minor fraction of the outer CNT surface is covered by an amorphous coating of about 12nm thickness, whereas a highly dispersed sub-monolayer deposition of BOx species is expected to be omnipresent, as the reduced surface area of modified CNTs may also be interpreted as the filling of surface defects and holes in the graphene layers."

[4] "B2O3-modified CNTs deactivate to a small extent initially, which may be due to the decomposition or thermal spreading of the deposited B2O3 precursor."

[5] "Boron oxide as an electron-deficient promoter tends to inhibit the dissociative adsorption of O2 and thus sustains the selective oxygen species on the catalyst surface."

The structural characteristics of B-based materials with 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks include:

1. High dispersion of boron and oxygen throughout the carbon nanotube (CNT) substrate.
2. Stability of the B-CNT composite under reaction conditions.
3. A thin amorphous coating (1-2 nm) on a minor fraction of the outer CNT surface.
4. Highly dispersed sub-monolayer deposition of BOx species, filling surface defects and holes in graphene layers.

These features enhance catalytic performance by:

1. Providing a large number of accessible active sites.
2. Maintaining catalyst stability during reactions.
3. Modifying the surface properties of CNTs to improve selectivity.
4. Inhibiting dissociative adsorption of O2, leading to more selective oxygen species on the catalyst surface.

The method used to incorporate B active components into these structures is incipient wetness impregnation using aqueous solutions of (NH4)2B10O16·8H2O. This method is effective for creating a highly dispersed boron oxide layer on CNTs. However, it has some limitations:

1. Initial deactivation due to decomposition or thermal spreading of the deposited B2O3 precursor.
2. Potential non-uniform distribution of boron oxide, with more deposition in the cavity and on the tips of CNTs.

The effectiveness of this method for different catalytic applications depends on the desired boron loading and the specific reaction conditions. For oxidative dehydrogenation of propane, even very low loadings (0.003 wt%) showed improved selectivity, indicating high effectiveness. However, for applications requiring higher boron loadings or more uniform distribution, alternative methods might be more suitable.

基于B的材料在多孔框架中具有3-D分散活性位点的结构特征包括：

1. 硼和氧在碳纳米管（CNT）基质中高度分散。
2. B-CNT复合材料在反应条件下稳定。
3. 在外部CNT表面的一小部分上有薄的非晶涂层（1-2 nm）。
4. 高度分散的亚单层BOx物种沉积，填充石墨烯层中的表面缺陷和孔隙。

这些特征通过以下方式增强催化性能：

1. 提供大量可接近的活性位点。
2. 在反应过程中保持催化剂稳定性。
3. 修改CNT的表面性质以提高选择性。
4. 抑制O2的解离吸附，导致催化剂表面上更具选择性的氧物种。

将B活性组分结合到这些结构中的方法是使用(NH4)2B10O16·8H2O水溶液进行浸渍。这种方法对于在CNT上创建高度分散的氧化硼层是有效的。然而，它有一些局限性：

1. 由于沉积的B2O3前体分解或热扩散，初始会出现轻微失活。
2. 氧化硼可能分布不均匀，在CNT的腔体和尖端处沉积更多。

这种方法对不同催化应用的有效性取决于所需的硼负载量和特定的反应条件。对于丙烷的氧化脱氢，即使是非常低的负载量（0.003 wt%）也显示出改善的选择性，表明高度有效。然而，对于需要更高硼负载量或更均匀分布的应用，其他方法可能更合适。
