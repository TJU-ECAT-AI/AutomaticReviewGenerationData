          [1] "Energy-filtered transmission electron microscopy (EF-TEM) shows that both boron and oxygen are highly dispersed throughout the CNT substrate"

[2] "The composite is stable under reaction conditions, and all of the B2O3 (1.7atom% B for 5B-oCNT) could be detected by electron energy-loss spectroscopy (EELS) after use in ODH"

[3] "Owing to the chosen preparation method, the majority of amorphous B2O3 is deposited in the cavity and on the tips of CNTs. Only a minor fraction of the outer CNT surface is covered by an amorphous coating of about 12nm thickness, whereas a highly dispersed sub-monolayer deposition of BOx species is expected to be omnipresent"

[4] "The good thermal stability of the doped samples during TPO indicates a covalent bonding to the CNT structure, whereas the B2O3/P2O5 filling of the CNTs acts as a backbone against oxidation."

[5] "Apart from the suppressed total combustion reaction on the modified CNTs, a further reason for enhanced propene selectivity may also be the lower reoxidation capacity of active sites. Boron oxide as an electron-deficient promoter tends to inhibit the dissociative adsorption of O2 and thus sustains the selective oxygen species on the catalyst surface."

[6] "B- and P-modified samples were prepared by incipient wetness impregnation of oCNTs (6mLg1) using aqueous solutions of (NH4)2B10O168H2O and (NH4)2HPO4 (Sigma Aldrich, >99%), to achieve loadings of between x=0.003 and 5wt% B2O3 or 5wt% P2O5."

[7] "B2O3-modified CNTs deactivate to a small extent initially, which may be due to the decomposition or thermal spreading of the deposited B2O3 precursor."

          The structural characteristics of B-based materials with 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks include:

1. High dispersion of boron and oxygen throughout the carbon nanotube (CNT) substrate.
2. Stability of the B-CNT composite under reaction conditions.
3. Majority of amorphous B2O3 deposited in the cavity and on the tips of CNTs.
4. Minor fraction of the outer CNT surface covered by a thin amorphous coating (1-2 nm thickness).
5. Highly dispersed sub-monolayer deposition of BOx species omnipresent, filling surface defects and holes in graphene layers.
6. Covalent bonding of boron to the CNT structure.
7. B2O3 filling of CNTs acting as a backbone against oxidation.

These structural features enhance catalytic performance by:

1. Providing a large number of accessible active sites.
2. Improving chemical stability and resistance to oxidation.
3. Suppressing total combustion reactions on modified CNTs.
4. Inhibiting dissociative adsorption of O2, sustaining selective oxygen species on the catalyst surface.
5. Enhancing propene selectivity in oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) reactions.
6. Blocking or covering combustion sites on the surface or groups causing COx formation.

The main method used to incorporate B active components into these structures is incipient wetness impregnation using aqueous solutions of (NH4)2B10O16·8H2O. This method is effective for:

1. Achieving uniform dispersion of boron oxide throughout the CNT structure.
2. Allowing precise control of B2O3 loading (between 0.003 and 5 wt%).
3. Creating a highly dispersed and stable boron oxide coating on CNTs.

The effectiveness of this method for different catalytic applications can be evaluated based on:

1. Its success in enhancing propene selectivity in ODH reactions.
2. The flexibility in controlling B2O3 loading, allowing for optimization of catalytic performance.
3. The stability of the resulting catalyst under reaction conditions.

However, the method's effectiveness may be limited by:

1. Initial deactivation due to decomposition or thermal spreading of the deposited B2O3 precursor.
2. Potential non-uniform distribution of B2O3 in larger-scale applications.
3. Possible agglomeration of B2O3 particles at higher loadings.

In conclusion, while the incipient wetness impregnation method has shown promising results for incorporating boron into CNT structures for ODH reactions, further research may be needed to optimize its effectiveness for other catalytic applications and larger-scale production.

          具有3-D分散活性位点的B基材料在多孔框架中的结构特征包括：

1. 硼和氧在碳纳米管（CNT）基质中高度分散。
2. B-CNT复合材料在反应条件下保持稳定。
3. 大部分无定形B2O3沉积在CNT的腔体和尖端。
4. 外部CNT表面的少部分被薄的无定形涂层覆盖（1-2纳米厚度）。
5. 高度分散的亚单层BOx物种沉积无处不在，填充石墨烯层中的表面缺陷和孔洞。
6. 硼与CNT结构共价键合。
7. B2O3填充CNT，作为抗氧化的骨架。

这些结构特征通过以下方式增强催化性能：

1. 提供大量可接近的活性位点。
2. 提高化学稳定性和抗氧化能力。
3. 抑制改性CNT上的完全燃烧反应。
4. 抑制O2的解离吸附，维持催化剂表面上的选择性氧物种。
5. 提高氧化脱氢（ODH）反应中丙烯的选择性。
6. 阻挡或覆盖表面上的燃烧位点或导致COx形成的基团。

将B活性组分引入这些结构的主要方法是使用(NH4)2B10O16·8H2O水溶液进行等体积浸渍。这种方法的有效性体现在：

1. 在CNT结构中实现硼氧化物的均匀分散。
2. 允许精确控制B2O3的负载量（在0.003至5 wt%之间）。
3. 在CNT上创建高度分散和稳定的硼氧化物涂层。

对于不同催化应用，该方法的有效性可以基于以下几点进行评估：

1. 在ODH反应中成功提高丙烯选择性。
2. 在控制B2O3负载量方面的灵活性，允许优化催化性能。
3. 结果催化剂在反应条件下的稳定性。

然而，该方法的有效性可能受到以下因素的限制：

1. 由于沉积的B2O3前体分解或热扩散，初始会出现轻微失活。
2. 在大规模应用中可能出现B2O3分布不均匀的问题。
3. 在较高负载量时可能出现B2O3颗粒团聚。

总之，虽然等体积浸渍法在将硼引入CNT结构用于ODH反应方面显示出良好的效果，但可能需要进一步研究以优化其在其他催化应用和大规模生产中的有效性。
