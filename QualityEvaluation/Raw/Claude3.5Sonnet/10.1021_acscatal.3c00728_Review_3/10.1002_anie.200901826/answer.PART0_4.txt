[1] "Energy-filtered transmission electron microscopy (EF-TEM) shows that both boron and oxygen are highly dispersed throughout the CNT substrate"

[2] "Only a minor fraction of the outer CNT surface is covered by an amorphous coating of about 12nm thickness, whereas a highly dispersed sub-monolayer deposition of BOx species is expected to be omnipresent, as the reduced surface area of modified CNTs may also be interpreted as the filling of surface defects and holes in the graphene layers."

[3] "B2O3-modified CNTs deactivate to a small extent initially, which may be due to the decomposition or thermal spreading of the deposited B2O3 precursor."

[4] "The good thermal stability of the doped samples during TPO indicates a covalent bonding to the CNT structure, whereas the B2O3/P2O5 filling of the CNTs acts as a backbone against oxidation."

[5] "B- and P-modified samples were prepared by incipient wetness impregnation of oCNTs (6mLg1) using aqueous solutions of (NH4)2B10O168H2O and (NH4)2HPO4 (Sigma Aldrich, >99%), to achieve loadings of between x=0.003 and 5wt% B2O3 or 5wt% P2O5."

The structural characteristics of B-based materials with 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks include:

1. Highly dispersed boron and oxygen throughout the carbon nanotube (CNT) substrate.
2. A sub-monolayer deposition of BOx species filling surface defects and holes in the graphene layers.
3. Minimal amorphous coating (1-2 nm thickness) on the outer CNT surface.
4. Covalent bonding of boron to the CNT structure.
5. B2O3 filling the CNTs, acting as a backbone against oxidation.

These structural features enhance catalytic performance by:

1. Providing a high dispersion of active sites throughout the 3-D framework.
2. Improving the thermal stability of the catalyst.
3. Blocking or covering combustion sites on the surface, leading to improved selectivity.
4. Inhibiting the dissociative adsorption of O2, maintaining selective oxygen species on the catalyst surface.

The main method used to incorporate B active components into these structures is incipient wetness impregnation using aqueous solutions of boron precursors. This method is effective for achieving precise loadings of B2O3 (0.003 to 5 wt%) and allows for uniform dispersion throughout the CNT structure.

The effectiveness of this incorporation method for different catalytic applications can be critically evaluated:

1. It is highly effective for oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) reactions, particularly for light alkanes like propane, where it significantly improves selectivity towards alkene formation.
2. The method allows for fine-tuning of the B2O3 loading, which is crucial for optimizing the balance between activity and selectivity in ODH reactions.
3. The high dispersion achieved helps in suppressing total oxidation reactions, making it particularly useful for selective oxidation processes.
4. The thermal stability imparted by this method makes the catalysts suitable for high-temperature applications.
5. However, the initial deactivation observed due to decomposition or thermal spreading of the B2O3 precursor suggests that further optimization of the incorporation method may be needed for some applications.

Overall, while this incorporation method is highly effective for ODH reactions and selective oxidation processes, its effectiveness for other catalytic applications would need to be evaluated on a case-by-case basis, considering factors such as reaction conditions, desired selectivity, and stability requirements.

具有3-D分散活性位点的B基材料在多孔框架中的结构特征包括：

1. 硼和氧在碳纳米管(CNT)基底中高度分散。
2. BOx物种的亚单层沉积填充石墨烯层中的表面缺陷和孔洞。
3. 外部CNT表面上的无定形涂层最小（1-2纳米厚度）。
4. 硼与CNT结构共价键合。
5. B2O3填充CNT，作为抗氧化的骨架。

这些结构特征通过以下方式增强催化性能：

1. 在3-D框架中提供高度分散的活性位点。
2. 提高催化剂的热稳定性。
3. 阻挡或覆盖表面的燃烧位点，从而提高选择性。
4. 抑制O2的解离吸附，保持催化剂表面的选择性氧物种。

将B活性组分结合到这些结构中的主要方法是使用硼前体的水溶液进行等体积浸渍。这种方法可以有效地达到精确的B2O3负载量（0.003至5 wt%），并允许在整个CNT结构中均匀分散。

对于不同的催化应用，这种结合方法的有效性可以进行批评性评估：

1. 它对氧化脱氢（ODH）反应非常有效，特别是对于丙烷等轻烷烃，显著提高了烯烃形成的选择性。
2. 该方法允许微调B2O3的负载量，这对于优化ODH反应中活性和选择性的平衡至关重要。
3. 实现的高度分散有助于抑制完全氧化反应，使其特别适用于选择性氧化过程。
4. 这种方法赋予的热稳定性使催化剂适用于高温应用。
5. 然而，由于B2O3前体的分解或热扩散而观察到的初始失活现象表明，对于某些应用，可能需要进一步优化结合方法。

总的来说，虽然这种结合方法对ODH反应和选择性氧化过程非常有效，但对于其他催化应用的有效性需要根据具体情况进行评估，考虑反应条件、所需选择性和稳定性要求等因素。
