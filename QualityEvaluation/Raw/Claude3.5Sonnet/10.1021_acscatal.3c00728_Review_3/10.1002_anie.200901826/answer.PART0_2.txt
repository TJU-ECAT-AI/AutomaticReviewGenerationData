[1] "Energy-filtered transmission electron microscopy (EF-TEM) shows that both boron and oxygen are highly dispersed throughout the CNT substrate"

[2] "Apart from the suppressed total combustion reaction on the modified CNTs, a further reason for enhanced propene selectivity may also be the lower reoxidation capacity of active sites. Boron oxide as an electron-deficient promoter tends to inhibit the dissociative adsorption of O2 and thus sustains the selective oxygen species on the catalyst surface."

[3] "Owing to the chosen preparation method, the majority of amorphous B2O3 is deposited in the cavity and on the tips of CNTs. Only a minor fraction of the outer CNT surface is covered by an amorphous coating of about 12nm thickness, whereas a highly dispersed sub-monolayer deposition of BOx species is expected to be omnipresent, as the reduced surface area of modified CNTs may also be interpreted as the filling of surface defects and holes in the graphene layers."

[4] "B- and P-modified samples were prepared by incipient wetness impregnation of oCNTs (6mLg1) using aqueous solutions of (NH4)2B10O168H2O and (NH4)2HPO4 (Sigma Aldrich, >99%), to achieve loadings of between x=0.003 and 5wt% B2O3 or 5wt% P2O5."

The structural characteristics of B-based materials with 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks include:

1. High dispersion of boron and oxygen throughout the carbon nanotube (CNT) substrate.
2. Deposition of amorphous B2O3 primarily in the cavity and on the tips of CNTs.
3. A thin amorphous coating (1-2 nm) on a minor fraction of the outer CNT surface.
4. Highly dispersed sub-monolayer deposition of BOx species filling surface defects and holes in graphene layers.

These structural features enhance catalytic performance by:

1. Suppressing total combustion reactions on modified CNTs.
2. Inhibiting dissociative adsorption of O2, sustaining selective oxygen species on the catalyst surface.
3. Improving chemical stability and resistance to oxidation.
4. Blocking or covering combustion sites on the surface or groups causing COx formation.

The main method used to incorporate B active components into these structures is incipient wetness impregnation using aqueous solutions of (NH4)2B10O16·8H2O. This method is effective for achieving uniform dispersion of boron oxide throughout the CNT structure and allows for precise control of B2O3 loading (between 0.003 and 5 wt%).

The effectiveness of this method for different catalytic applications can be evaluated based on:

1. Its ability to create a highly dispersed and stable boron oxide coating on CNTs.
2. The flexibility in controlling B2O3 loading, allowing for optimization of catalytic performance.
3. The successful enhancement of propene selectivity in oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) reactions.

However, the method's effectiveness may be limited by:

1. The potential for non-uniform distribution of B2O3 in larger-scale applications.
2. Possible agglomeration of B2O3 particles at higher loadings.
3. The need for further optimization to increase overall catalytic activity while maintaining high selectivity.

In conclusion, while the incipient wetness impregnation method has shown promising results for incorporating boron into CNT structures for ODH reactions, further research may be needed to optimize its effectiveness for other catalytic applications and larger-scale production.

具有3-D分散活性位点的B基材料在多孔框架中的结构特征包括：

1. 硼和氧在碳纳米管（CNT）基质中高度分散。
2. 无定形B2O3主要沉积在CNT的腔体和顶端。
3. 在少量外部CNT表面上形成薄的无定形涂层（1-2 nm）。
4. 高度分散的BOx亚单层沉积物填充石墨烯层的表面缺陷和孔洞。

这些结构特征通过以下方式增强催化性能：

1. 抑制改性CNT上的完全燃烧反应。
2. 抑制O2的解离吸附，维持催化剂表面上的选择性氧物种。
3. 提高化学稳定性和抗氧化能力。
4. 阻挡或覆盖表面上的燃烧位点或导致COx形成的基团。

将B活性组分引入这些结构的主要方法是使用(NH4)2B10O16·8H2O水溶液进行浸渍。这种方法可以有效地在CNT结构中实现硼氧化物的均匀分散，并允许精确控制B2O3的负载量（在0.003至5 wt%之间）。

对于不同催化应用，该方法的有效性可以基于以下几点进行评估：

1. 能够在CNT上创建高度分散和稳定的硼氧化物涂层。
2. 在控制B2O3负载量方面的灵活性，允许优化催化性能。
3. 成功提高了氧化脱氢（ODH）反应中丙烯的选择性。

然而，该方法的有效性可能受到以下因素的限制：

1. 在大规模应用中可能出现B2O3分布不均匀的问题。
2. 在较高负载量时可能出现B2O3颗粒团聚。
3. 需要进一步优化以提高整体催化活性，同时保持高选择性。

总之，虽然浸渍法在将硼引入CNT结构用于ODH反应方面显示出良好的效果，但可能需要进一步研究以优化其在其他催化应用和大规模生产中的有效性。
