[1] "It is demonstrated that the chromium catalysts supported on MCF exhibit much higher catalytic activity in terms of propane conversion and propylene yield than literature results obtained over chromium-supported mesoporous SBA-15 or MCM-41 catalysts during the ODH of propane."

[2] "Enhanced catalytic performance of the chromium-containing mesoporous MCF catalysts has been attributed to the unique three-dimensional (3D), continuous, ultralarge mesopore structure of the MCF materials, which allow a much faster internal molecular transport during the ODH of propane."

The given literature does not specifically discuss B-based materials or methods for incorporating B active components. Instead, it focuses on chromium-supported mesocellular silica foam (MCF) catalysts for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane. 

The text does highlight some general principles that may be relevant to the question:

1. The 3D structure of the support material (MCF in this case) plays a crucial role in enhancing catalytic performance.

2. The continuous, ultralarge mesopore structure allows for faster internal molecular transport, which contributes to improved catalytic activity.

3. The choice of support material (MCF vs SBA-15 or MCM-41) significantly impacts the catalytic performance, even when using the same active component (chromium in this case).

However, without specific information about B-based materials, it is not possible to directly answer the question about their structural characteristics, methods of incorporation, or relative effectiveness for different catalytic applications based solely on this literature.

给定的文献并未具体讨论基于B的材料或将B活性组分引入的方法。相反，它主要关注铬负载的介孔泡沫硅(MCF)催化剂在丙烷氧化脱氢中的应用。

文本确实突出了一些可能与问题相关的一般原则：

1. 载体材料的三维结构(本例中为MCF)在提高催化性能方面起着至关重要的作用。

2. 连续的超大介孔结构允许更快的内部分子传输，这有助于提高催化活性。

3. 载体材料的选择(MCF与SBA-15或MCM-41)对催化性能有显著影响，即使使用相同的活性组分(本例中为铬)。

然而，由于缺乏关于基于B的材料的具体信息，仅凭这篇文献无法直接回答关于它们的结构特征、引入方法或在不同催化应用中的相对有效性的问题。
