[1] "Enhanced catalytic performance of the chromium-containing mesoporous MCF catalysts has been attributed to the unique three-dimensional (3D), continuous, ultralarge mesopore structure of the MCF materials, which allow a much faster internal molecular transport during the ODH of propane."

The literature does not provide specific information about B-based materials with 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks. The text only mentions chromium-containing mesoporous MCF catalysts with a 3D structure. It does not discuss boron-based materials, methods of incorporating boron, or evaluate their effectiveness for different catalytic applications. The question cannot be fully answered based on the given literature.

The document does highlight that a 3D, continuous, ultralarge mesopore structure enhances catalytic performance by allowing faster internal molecular transport. This principle could potentially apply to other porous catalysts, including B-based materials, but that would be an extrapolation beyond what is directly stated in the text.

该文献没有提供关于具有3-D分散活性位点的B基材料在多孔框架中的具体信息。文本仅提到具有3D结构的含铬介孔MCF催化剂。它没有讨论硼基材料、掺入硼的方法，也没有评估它们在不同催化应用中的有效性。基于给定的文献无法完全回答这个问题。

文档确实强调了3D、连续、超大介孔结构通过允许更快的内部分子传输来增强催化性能。这一原理可能适用于其他多孔催化剂，包括B基材料，但这将超出文本直接陈述的范围。
