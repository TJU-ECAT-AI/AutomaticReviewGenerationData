[1] "It is demonstrated that the chromium catalysts supported on MCF exhibit much higher catalytic activity in terms of propane conversion and propylene yield than literature results obtained over chromium-supported mesoporous SBA-15 or MCM-41 catalysts during the ODH of propane."

[2] "Enhanced catalytic performance of the chromium-containing mesoporous MCF catalysts has been attributed to the unique three-dimensional (3D), continuous, ultralarge mesopore structure of the MCF materials, which allow a much faster internal molecular transport during the ODH of propane."

The provided literature does not contain specific information about B-based materials with 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks. The text focuses on chromium-supported mesocellular silica foam (MCF) catalysts for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane. While this is not directly related to B-based materials, some general insights can be drawn about the importance of 3-D porous structures in enhancing catalytic performance.

The literature demonstrates that the unique three-dimensional, continuous, ultralarge mesopore structure of MCF materials allows for much faster internal molecular transport during catalytic reactions. This structural characteristic leads to higher catalytic activity in terms of propane conversion and propylene yield compared to other mesoporous supports like SBA-15 or MCM-41.

However, the document does not provide information on the methods used to incorporate active components into these structures or their relative effectiveness for different catalytic applications. The focus is specifically on chromium-supported MCF catalysts for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane, and does not discuss B-based materials or other catalytic applications.

所提供的文献中并不包含关于具有3-D分散活性位点的B基材料在多孔框架中的具体信息。该文本主要关注铬支持的介孔泡沫硅胶(MCF)催化剂在丙烷氧化脱氢中的应用。虽然这与B基材料没有直接关系，但可以从中得到一些关于3-D多孔结构在提高催化性能方面重要性的一般见解。

文献表明，MCF材料独特的三维、连续、超大介孔结构允许在催化反应过程中进行更快的内部分子传输。这种结构特征导致了在丙烷转化和丙烯产率方面比其他介孔载体（如SBA-15或MCM-41）具有更高的催化活性。

然而，该文档并未提供将活性组分结合到这些结构中的方法，也未讨论它们对不同催化应用的相对有效性。文章的重点特别在于铬支持的MCF催化剂在丙烷氧化脱氢中的应用，并未讨论B基材料或其他催化应用。
