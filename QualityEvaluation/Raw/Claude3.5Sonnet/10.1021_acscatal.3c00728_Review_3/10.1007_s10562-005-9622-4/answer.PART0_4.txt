[1] "A series of chromium-containing mesocellular silica foam (MCF) catalysts have been prepared and characterized in the oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of propane between 350 and 600 C."

[2] "It is demonstrated that the chromium catalysts supported on MCF exhibit much higher catalytic activity in terms of propane conversion and propylene yield than literature results obtained over chromium-supported mesoporous SBA-15 or MCM-41 catalysts during the ODH of propane."

[3] "Enhanced catalytic performance of the chromium-containing mesoporous MCF catalysts has been attributed to the unique three-dimensional (3D), continuous, ultralarge mesopore structure of the MCF materials, which allow a much faster internal molecular transport during the ODH of propane."

The literature does not specifically discuss B-based materials or methods to incorporate B active components. Instead, it focuses on chromium-containing mesocellular silica foam (MCF) catalysts. However, we can draw some parallels to answer the question:

The structural characteristics described for the MCF catalysts include a three-dimensional (3D), continuous, ultralarge mesopore structure. These features enhance catalytic performance by allowing faster internal molecular transport during the oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of propane. This results in higher catalytic activity in terms of propane conversion and propylene yield compared to other mesoporous supports like SBA-15 or MCM-41.

While the literature doesn't discuss methods for incorporating B active components, it mentions the preparation of chromium-containing MCF catalysts. The effectiveness of this incorporation method is demonstrated by the enhanced catalytic performance in the ODH of propane.

The study suggests that the 3D porous framework with dispersed active sites (in this case, chromium) significantly improves catalytic performance. This principle could potentially be applied to B-based materials in other catalytic applications, though specific examples are not provided in this literature.

这篇文献并没有具体讨论基于B的材料或将B活性组分引入的方法。相反，它主要关注含铬的介孔蜂窝状二氧化硅泡沫（MCF）催化剂。然而，我们可以通过类比来回答这个问题：

文中描述的MCF催化剂的结构特征包括三维（3D）、连续的、超大介孔结构。这些特征通过允许在丙烷的氧化脱氢（ODH）过程中更快的内部分子传输来增强催化性能。与其他介孔载体如SBA-15或MCM-41相比，这导致了更高的催化活性，体现在丙烷转化率和丙烯产率上。

虽然文献没有讨论引入B活性组分的方法，但它提到了含铬MCF催化剂的制备。这种引入方法的有效性通过丙烷ODH过程中增强的催化性能得到了证明。

研究表明，具有分散活性位点（在本例中为铬）的3D多孔框架显著提高了催化性能。这一原理可能适用于其他催化应用中的基于B的材料，尽管本文献中没有提供具体的例子。
