[1] "It is demonstrated that the chromium catalysts supported on MCF exhibit much higher catalytic activity in terms of propane conversion and propylene yield than literature results obtained over chromium-supported mesoporous SBA-15 or MCM-41 catalysts during the ODH of propane."

[2] "Enhanced catalytic performance of the chromium-containing mesoporous MCF catalysts has been attributed to the unique three-dimensional (3D), continuous, ultralarge mesopore structure of the MCF materials, which allow a much faster internal molecular transport during the ODH of propane."

The provided literature does not contain specific information about B-based materials with 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks. The text focuses on chromium-supported mesocellular silica foam (MCF) catalysts for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane. While this is not directly relevant to the question about B-based materials, some general principles can be inferred:

The literature demonstrates that the three-dimensional, continuous, ultralarge mesopore structure of MCF materials enhances catalytic performance by allowing faster internal molecular transport. This principle could potentially apply to other 3-D porous frameworks, including B-based materials.

The study compares MCF-supported catalysts to those supported on SBA-15 or MCM-41, showing improved performance. This suggests that the specific structure of the support material plays a crucial role in catalytic activity.

However, the literature does not provide information on methods for incorporating B active components into porous structures or their relative effectiveness for different catalytic applications. To properly address the question, additional research focusing specifically on B-based materials would be necessary.

提供的文献不包含关于具有三维分散活性位点的B基材料在多孔框架中的具体信息。文本主要关注铬支持的介孔蜂窝状硅泡沫（MCF）催化剂在丙烷氧化脱氢中的应用。虽然这与关于B基材料的问题不直接相关，但可以推断出一些一般原则：

文献表明，MCF材料的三维连续超大介孔结构通过允许更快的内部分子传输来增强催化性能。这一原理可能适用于其他三维多孔框架，包括B基材料。

该研究将MCF支持的催化剂与SBA-15或MCM-41支持的催化剂进行了比较，显示出性能的改善。这表明支持材料的具体结构在催化活性中起着关键作用。

然而，文献并未提供将B活性组分引入多孔结构的方法或它们在不同催化应用中的相对有效性的信息。要正确回答这个问题，需要进行额外的专门针对B基材料的研究。
