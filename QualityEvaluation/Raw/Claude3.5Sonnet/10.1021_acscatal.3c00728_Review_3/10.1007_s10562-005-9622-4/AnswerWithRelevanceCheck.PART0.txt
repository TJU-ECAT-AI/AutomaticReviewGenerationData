          [1] "It is demonstrated that the chromium catalysts supported on MCF exhibit much higher catalytic activity in terms of propane conversion and propylene yield than literature results obtained over chromium-supported mesoporous SBA-15 or MCM-41 catalysts during the ODH of propane."

          [2] "Enhanced catalytic performance of the chromium-containing mesoporous MCF catalysts has been attributed to the unique three-dimensional (3D), continuous, ultralarge mesopore structure of the MCF materials, which allow a much faster internal molecular transport during the ODH of propane."

          [3] "A series of chromium-containing mesocellular silica foam (MCF) catalysts have been prepared and characterized in the oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of propane between 350 and 600 C."

          While the provided literature does not specifically discuss B-based materials, it offers insights into the structural characteristics of 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks, using chromium-containing mesocellular silica foam (MCF) catalysts as an example. The key structural features enhancing catalytic performance include:

          1. Three-dimensional (3D) structure
          2. Continuous framework
          3. Ultralarge mesopore structure

          These characteristics allow for faster internal molecular transport during catalytic reactions, leading to higher catalytic activity. The MCF-supported chromium catalysts demonstrated superior performance in propane conversion and propylene yield compared to other mesoporous supports like SBA-15 or MCM-41.

          Regarding the incorporation of active components, the literature mentions the preparation of chromium-containing MCF catalysts but does not provide specific details on the methods used. The effectiveness of this incorporation is evidenced by the enhanced catalytic performance in the oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of propane.

          While the study focuses on chromium catalysts for propane ODH, the principles of using 3-D porous frameworks with dispersed active sites to enhance catalytic performance could potentially be applied to B-based materials in other catalytic applications. However, the literature does not provide specific information on B-based materials or their relative effectiveness for different catalytic applications.

          虽然提供的文献没有具体讨论基于B的材料，但它通过以含铬的介孔蜂窝状二氧化硅泡沫（MCF）催化剂为例，提供了关于多孔框架中3-D分散活性位点的结构特征的见解。提高催化性能的关键结构特征包括：

          1. 三维（3D）结构
          2. 连续框架
          3. 超大介孔结构

          这些特征允许在催化反应过程中进行更快的内部分子传输，从而导致更高的催化活性。MCF支持的铬催化剂在丙烷转化和丙烯产率方面表现出优于其他介孔载体（如SBA-15或MCM-41）的性能。

          关于活性组分的引入，文献提到了含铬MCF催化剂的制备，但没有提供使用方法的具体细节。这种引入的有效性通过丙烷氧化脱氢（ODH）中增强的催化性能得到了证明。

          虽然该研究重点关注丙烷ODH的铬催化剂，但使用具有分散活性位点的3-D多孔框架来增强催化性能的原理可能适用于其他催化应用中的基于B的材料。然而，文献没有提供关于基于B的材料或它们在不同催化应用中的相对有效性的具体信息。
