[1] "It is demonstrated that the chromium catalysts supported on MCF exhibit much higher catalytic activity in terms of propane conversion and propylene yield than literature results obtained over chromium-supported mesoporous SBA-15 or MCM-41 catalysts during the ODH of propane."

[2] "Enhanced catalytic performance of the chromium-containing mesoporous MCF catalysts has been attributed to the unique three-dimensional (3D), continuous, ultralarge mesopore structure of the MCF materials, which allow a much faster internal molecular transport during the ODH of propane."

The provided literature does not contain specific information about B-based materials with 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks. The text focuses on chromium-supported mesocellular silica foam (MCF) catalysts for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane. While this is not directly relevant to the question about B-based materials, some general principles can be inferred:

The literature demonstrates that the three-dimensional, continuous, ultralarge mesopore structure of MCF materials enhances catalytic performance by allowing faster internal molecular transport. This principle could potentially apply to other 3-D porous frameworks, including B-based materials.

The study compares MCF-supported catalysts to those supported on SBA-15 or MCM-41, showing improved performance. This suggests that the specific structure of the support material plays a crucial role in catalytic activity.

However, the literature does not provide information on methods for incorporating B active components into porous structures or their relative effectiveness for different catalytic applications. To properly address the question, additional research focusing specifically on B-based materials would be necessary.

提供的文献不包含关于具有三维分散活性位点的B基材料在多孔框架中的具体信息。文本主要关注铬支持的介孔蜂窝状硅泡沫（MCF）催化剂在丙烷氧化脱氢中的应用。虽然这与关于B基材料的问题不直接相关，但可以推断出一些一般原则：

文献表明，MCF材料的三维连续超大介孔结构通过允许更快的内部分子传输来增强催化性能。这一原理可能适用于其他三维多孔框架，包括B基材料。

该研究将MCF支持的催化剂与SBA-15或MCM-41支持的催化剂进行了比较，显示出性能的改善。这表明支持材料的具体结构在催化活性中起着关键作用。

然而，文献并未提供将B活性组分引入多孔结构的方法或它们在不同催化应用中的相对有效性的信息。要正确回答这个问题，需要进行额外的专门针对B基材料的研究。

The literature does not provide specific information about B-based materials with 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks. The text only mentions chromium-containing mesoporous MCF catalysts with a 3D structure. It does not discuss boron-based materials, methods of incorporating boron, or evaluate their effectiveness for different catalytic applications. The question cannot be fully answered based on the given literature.

The document does highlight that a 3D, continuous, ultralarge mesopore structure enhances catalytic performance by allowing faster internal molecular transport. This principle could potentially apply to other porous catalysts, including B-based materials, but that would be an extrapolation beyond what is directly stated in the text.

该文献没有提供关于具有3-D分散活性位点的B基材料在多孔框架中的具体信息。文本仅提到具有3D结构的含铬介孔MCF催化剂。它没有讨论硼基材料、掺入硼的方法，也没有评估它们在不同催化应用中的有效性。基于给定的文献无法完全回答这个问题。

文档确实强调了3D、连续、超大介孔结构通过允许更快的内部分子传输来增强催化性能。这一原理可能适用于其他多孔催化剂，包括B基材料，但这将超出文本直接陈述的范围。

The provided literature does not contain specific information about B-based materials with 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks. The text focuses on chromium-supported mesocellular silica foam (MCF) catalysts for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane. While this is not directly related to B-based materials, some general insights can be drawn about the importance of 3-D porous structures in enhancing catalytic performance.

The literature demonstrates that the unique three-dimensional, continuous, ultralarge mesopore structure of MCF materials allows for much faster internal molecular transport during catalytic reactions. This structural characteristic leads to higher catalytic activity in terms of propane conversion and propylene yield compared to other mesoporous supports like SBA-15 or MCM-41.

However, the document does not provide information on the methods used to incorporate active components into these structures or their relative effectiveness for different catalytic applications. The focus is specifically on chromium-supported MCF catalysts for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane, and does not discuss B-based materials or other catalytic applications.

所提供的文献中并不包含关于具有3-D分散活性位点的B基材料在多孔框架中的具体信息。该文本主要关注铬支持的介孔泡沫硅胶(MCF)催化剂在丙烷氧化脱氢中的应用。虽然这与B基材料没有直接关系，但可以从中得到一些关于3-D多孔结构在提高催化性能方面重要性的一般见解。

文献表明，MCF材料独特的三维、连续、超大介孔结构允许在催化反应过程中进行更快的内部分子传输。这种结构特征导致了在丙烷转化和丙烯产率方面比其他介孔载体（如SBA-15或MCM-41）具有更高的催化活性。

然而，该文档并未提供将活性组分结合到这些结构中的方法，也未讨论它们对不同催化应用的相对有效性。文章的重点特别在于铬支持的MCF催化剂在丙烷氧化脱氢中的应用，并未讨论B基材料或其他催化应用。

The given literature does not specifically discuss B-based materials or methods for incorporating B active components. Instead, it focuses on chromium-supported mesocellular silica foam (MCF) catalysts for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane. 

The text does highlight some general principles that may be relevant to the question:

1. The 3D structure of the support material (MCF in this case) plays a crucial role in enhancing catalytic performance.

2. The continuous, ultralarge mesopore structure allows for faster internal molecular transport, which contributes to improved catalytic activity.

3. The choice of support material (MCF vs SBA-15 or MCM-41) significantly impacts the catalytic performance, even when using the same active component (chromium in this case).

However, without specific information about B-based materials, it is not possible to directly answer the question about their structural characteristics, methods of incorporation, or relative effectiveness for different catalytic applications based solely on this literature.

给定的文献并未具体讨论基于B的材料或将B活性组分引入的方法。相反，它主要关注铬负载的介孔泡沫硅(MCF)催化剂在丙烷氧化脱氢中的应用。

文本确实突出了一些可能与问题相关的一般原则：

1. 载体材料的三维结构(本例中为MCF)在提高催化性能方面起着至关重要的作用。

2. 连续的超大介孔结构允许更快的内部分子传输，这有助于提高催化活性。

3. 载体材料的选择(MCF与SBA-15或MCM-41)对催化性能有显著影响，即使使用相同的活性组分(本例中为铬)。

然而，由于缺乏关于基于B的材料的具体信息，仅凭这篇文献无法直接回答关于它们的结构特征、引入方法或在不同催化应用中的相对有效性的问题。

The literature does not specifically discuss B-based materials or methods to incorporate B active components. Instead, it focuses on chromium-containing mesocellular silica foam (MCF) catalysts. However, we can draw some parallels to answer the question:

The structural characteristics described for the MCF catalysts include a three-dimensional (3D), continuous, ultralarge mesopore structure. These features enhance catalytic performance by allowing faster internal molecular transport during the oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of propane. This results in higher catalytic activity in terms of propane conversion and propylene yield compared to other mesoporous supports like SBA-15 or MCM-41.

While the literature doesn't discuss methods for incorporating B active components, it mentions the preparation of chromium-containing MCF catalysts. The effectiveness of this incorporation method is demonstrated by the enhanced catalytic performance in the ODH of propane.

The study suggests that the 3D porous framework with dispersed active sites (in this case, chromium) significantly improves catalytic performance. This principle could potentially be applied to B-based materials in other catalytic applications, though specific examples are not provided in this literature.

这篇文献并没有具体讨论基于B的材料或将B活性组分引入的方法。相反，它主要关注含铬的介孔蜂窝状二氧化硅泡沫（MCF）催化剂。然而，我们可以通过类比来回答这个问题：

文中描述的MCF催化剂的结构特征包括三维（3D）、连续的、超大介孔结构。这些特征通过允许在丙烷的氧化脱氢（ODH）过程中更快的内部分子传输来增强催化性能。与其他介孔载体如SBA-15或MCM-41相比，这导致了更高的催化活性，体现在丙烷转化率和丙烯产率上。

虽然文献没有讨论引入B活性组分的方法，但它提到了含铬MCF催化剂的制备。这种引入方法的有效性通过丙烷ODH过程中增强的催化性能得到了证明。

研究表明，具有分散活性位点（在本例中为铬）的3D多孔框架显著提高了催化性能。这一原理可能适用于其他催化应用中的基于B的材料，尽管本文献中没有提供具体的例子。
