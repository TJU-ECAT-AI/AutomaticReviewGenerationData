          "Boron oxide embedded in zeolites Zeolites are crystalline aluminosilicate materials with three-dimensional network containing channels and cavities of molecular dimensions, and the presence of Al in tetrahedra makes the framework negatively charged."

"Recently, layered borosilicate zeolite (ERB-1, MWW structure) with defective trigonal boron species was reported as a highly active and selective catalyst for the ODH of propane to take advantage of their specific morphology inherent with large internal surface areas, micropore structure and high thermal stability."

"In these synthesized zeolites, the boron species were classified into five types according to solid-state 11B MAS NMR, i.e. framework trigonal B(OSi)xOH3x(x=1,2), B(OSi)3, tetrahedral B(OH)2(OSi)2, B(OSi)4 and aggregated terminal BOH species"

"Isomorphous substitution of tri- or tetravalent metal atoms (Al, Ti, Fe and V) by borosilicate zeolites is a good route in the production of some new zeolites that need expensive organic structure directing agents (OSDAs), long crystallization time or co-presence of dopant."

"Furthermore, taking advantage of the high propensity of boron to hydrolyze, its presence benefits the fabrication of mesoporous zeolite, and may increase the mesopore volume by 46%."

"Lu and coworkers synthesized mesoporous silica-supported boron oxide catalysts (B2O3/SBA-15) and identified four B species by using the 11B NMR technique"

"In order to improve the exposure of active sites and the mass transfer, a three-dimensional ordered macroporous BPO4 material was developed with a robust framework, which exhibited excellent activity and selectivity in the ODH of propane"

"A B2O3@BPO4 sandwich-like hollow sphere was reported as a liquid-phase catalyst in ODH of propane, and remained stable for 27 h at 550 C with a C3H6 productivity of 0.79 gC3H6 gcat1 h1"

"The preparation of a boron nitride wash-coated monolithic catalyst49 offered an applicable way to improve, besides the olefin selectivity, the heat and mass transfer which is vital for industrialization owing to the intrinsic feature of high exothermicity of the ODH reaction that could produce hotspots and thus subsequent negative consequences in the olefin selectivity and safety issues."

"By means of similar strategies, functionalized silicon boride, supported B2O3 on high surface area SBA-15, and ordered macroporous boron phosphate were also reported with remarkable performance in the ODH of light alkanes."

"For h-BN, the edge-hydroxylation of BN, synthesis of BN with boric acid and dicyanamide, and assembly of 2D BN nanosheets into 3D ordered architectures were reported as effective ways to enhance the catalytic activity of BN."

"When using dicyanamide to substitute for urea in the preparation for high surface area boron nitride, its enhanced catalytic performance was maintained in the ODH of propane in view of the 53% propylene selectivity and 18% ethylene selectivity at a 52% propane conversion."

          B-based materials with 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks exhibit several structural characteristics that enhance catalytic performance:

1. Three-dimensional network structure: Materials like zeolites and ordered macroporous structures provide a framework with channels and cavities of molecular dimensions, allowing for high surface area and controlled access to active sites.

2. High surface area: Mesoporous silica supports, layered zeolites, and other porous materials offer large internal surface areas, increasing the number of accessible active sites.

3. Diverse boron species: Multiple types of boron species can be incorporated, including framework trigonal and tetrahedral boron, as well as terminal BOH groups. This diversity of active sites can contribute to improved catalytic activity and selectivity.

4. Micro-, meso-, and macroporous structures: The combination of different pore sizes improves mass transfer properties and accessibility of active sites.

5. Thermal stability: Zeolite frameworks and other robust structures provide high thermal stability, crucial for maintaining catalyst performance under harsh reaction conditions.

6. Hollow spheres and 3D ordered architectures: These structures provide high surface area, improved stability, and enhanced mass transfer properties.

Methods used to incorporate B active components into these structures include:

1. Isomorphous substitution: Replacing Al, Ti, Fe, or V atoms in zeolite frameworks with boron.
2. Direct synthesis: Incorporating boron during the initial material synthesis process.
3. Post-synthesis modification: Treating pre-formed materials with boron-containing compounds.
4. Impregnation: Used for preparing supported catalysts like B2O3/SBA-15.
5. Template-assisted synthesis: Used to create ordered macroporous BPO4 materials.
6. Core-shell synthesis: Employed to create B2O3@BPO4 sandwich-like hollow spheres.
7. Wash-coating: Applied to create monolithic catalysts.
8. Edge-functionalization: Hydroxylation of BN edges to increase active sites.
9. Precursor-based synthesis: Using boric acid and dicyanamide to synthesize BN with desired properties.
10. Assembly techniques: Creating 3D ordered architectures from 2D BN nanosheets.

The effectiveness of these methods varies depending on the desired catalytic application. Each method has its advantages and limitations, and the choice depends on the desired catalyst properties, reaction conditions, and scalability requirements for the specific catalytic application.
