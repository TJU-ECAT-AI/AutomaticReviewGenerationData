          [1] "Zeolites are one of the most common catalyst supports, and widely used in industry due to its large internal surface areas, micropores of molecular dimension, and high thermal stabilities"

[2] "Layered borosilicate zeolites were synthesized."

[3] "The presence of boron in the framework was confirmed by the FT-IR spectra"

[4] "The bands at 1405 and 926 cm1 were assigned to trigonally and tetrahedrally coordinated boron respectively"

[5] "11B MAS NMR spectra of as-prepared BZEO-2 and after different reaction intervals were measured"

[6] "At least five types of major B species (B[3]a, B[3]b, B[3]c, B[4]a and B[4]b) present in the catalysts."

[7] "The peaks at 18, 15 and 11 ppm were ascribed to tri-coordinated boron which denoted as B[3]a, B[3]b and B[3]c respectively."

[8] "Sites B[3]b and B[3]c were assigned to framework B(OSi)xOH3-x(x=1,2) and B(OSi)3 structure"

[9] "The sharp peaks at around 0 ppm and 2.8 ppm were accordingly assigned to B(OH)2(OSi)2 and B(OSi)4 tetrahedral framework, donated as B[4]a and B[4]b"

[10] "We postulate that B[3]a and B[3]b are responsible for the ODH activity."

[11] "The N2 adsorption-desorption isotherms of different boron-containing MWW-typed zeolites exhibited nearly type-I shape (Fig. 2b), featuring predominantly micropores with a small proportion of interstitial mesopores."

[12] "As seen in Fig. 2a, the X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns showed four main diffraction peaks at 2θ = 7.21, 8.02, 10.10 and 26.33, corresponding to the known (1 0 0), (1 0 1), (1 0 2) and (3 1 0) reflections of ERB-1, which confirmed the MWW structure"

          The B-based materials with 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks exhibit several structural characteristics that enhance catalytic performance:

1. Large internal surface areas and micropores of molecular dimensions, which provide abundant active sites and facilitate mass transport.

2. High thermal stability, allowing the catalysts to withstand harsh reaction conditions.

3. Incorporation of boron into the zeolite framework, creating various boron species with different coordination environments.

4. Presence of both trigonal and tetrahedral boron species, with at least five major types identified: B[3]a, B[3]b, B[3]c, B[4]a, and B[4]b.

5. Layered structure with MWW topology, confirmed by XRD patterns.

6. Predominantly microporous structure with a small proportion of interstitial mesopores, as evidenced by N2 adsorption-desorption isotherms.

These structural features enhance catalytic performance by providing a high concentration of accessible active sites, improving thermal stability, and allowing for tailored reactivity through different boron coordination environments.

The methods used to incorporate B active components into these structures include:

1. Hydrothermal synthesis of layered borosilicate zeolites.
2. Direct incorporation of boron into the zeolite framework during synthesis.

The effectiveness of these methods can be evaluated by:

1. FT-IR spectroscopy to confirm the presence of boron in the framework.
2. 11B MAS NMR spectroscopy to identify and quantify different boron species.
3. XRD to confirm the zeolite structure and crystallinity.
4. N2 adsorption-desorption analysis to characterize the pore structure.
5. Catalytic performance testing in reactions such as propane ODH.

The hydrothermal synthesis method appears to be effective for creating borosilicate zeolites with well-dispersed boron species. It allows for the incorporation of boron into the zeolite framework and the creation of various boron coordination environments, including the defective trigonal structures (B[3]a and B[3]b) that are postulated to be responsible for ODH activity.

The effectiveness of this method for different catalytic applications depends on the specific reaction requirements. For ODH reactions, the creation of defective trigonal boron structures appears to be particularly beneficial. However, the relative effectiveness for other catalytic applications would require further investigation and comparison with alternative synthesis methods.

Further research is needed to optimize boron incorporation methods for specific catalytic applications and to better understand the relationship between boron coordination environment and catalytic performance in various reactions.

          具有三维分散活性位点的B基多孔框架材料展现出几个增强催化性能的结构特征：

1. 大的内部表面积和分子尺度的微孔，提供了丰富的活性位点并促进了质量传输。

2. 高热稳定性，使催化剂能够承受严苛的反应条件。

3. 将硼掺入沸石框架，创造了具有不同配位环境的各种硼物种。

4. 同时存在三配位和四配位硼物种，至少识别出五种主要类型：B[3]a、B[3]b、B[3]c、B[4]a和B[4]b。

5. 具有MWW拓扑结构的层状结构，通过XRD图谱确认。

6. 以微孔为主，含有少量介孔的结构，由N2吸附-脱附等温线证实。

这些结构特征通过提供高浓度的可接近活性位点、提高热稳定性，以及通过不同的硼配位环境允许定制反应性，从而增强了催化性能。

将B活性组分掺入这些结构的方法包括：

1. 水热合成层状硼硅沸石。
2. 在合成过程中将硼直接掺入沸石框架。

这些方法的有效性可以通过以下方式评估：

1. 傅里叶变换红外光谱（FT-IR）确认框架中硼的存在。
2. 11B魔角旋转核磁共振（MAS NMR）光谱鉴定和量化不同的硼物种。
3. XRD确认沸石结构和结晶度。
4. N2吸附-脱附分析表征孔结构。
5. 在如丙烷ODH等反应中进行催化性能测试。

水热合成方法似乎对创建具有良好分散硼物种的硼硅沸石有效。它允许将硼掺入沸石框架并创造各种硼配位环境，包括被认为负责ODH活性的缺陷型三配位结构（B[3]a和B[3]b）。

这种方法对不同催化应用的有效性取决于特定反应的要求。对于ODH反应，创造缺陷型三配位硼结构似乎特别有益。然而，对于其他催化应用的相对有效性，需要进行进一步研究和与其他合成方法进行比较。

需要进一步研究以优化特定催化应用的硼掺入方法，并更好地理解硼配位环境与各种反应中催化性能之间的关系。
