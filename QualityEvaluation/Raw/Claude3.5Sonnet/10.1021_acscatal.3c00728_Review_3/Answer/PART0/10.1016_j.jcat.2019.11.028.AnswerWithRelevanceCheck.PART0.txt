          "B2O3@BPO4 sandwich-like hollow spheres were synthesized via a one-step template-free method."

"At reaction temperatures (>450 C), melted B2O3 supported on the surface of BPO4 hollow spheres acts as a catalytically active species for the selective oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propene, with an excellent productivity of 0.79 gC3H6 gcat1 h1 and a high stability at 550 C."

"Herein, we present a B2O3@BPO4 composite with a sandwich-like hollow sphere structure produced using a one-step template-free method without any postprocessing. The sandwich-like B2O3 composite consists of BPO4 hollow spheres covered with B2O3 nanowires at room temperature."

"For traditional supported catalysts, to gain more active sites, hollow micro-/nanostructured materials with low density, large surface area, and high loading capacity are often used as supports"

"Commonly, the maximum utilization of the two sides of planar supports is allowed by sandwich-like structures, but sandwich-like structures are rarely used in hollow-sphere structures due to the difficulty of capsulation at micro-/nanoscale."

"During the cooling process, liquid B2O3 cools down and solidifies into nanowires covering both the inside and outside of the BPO4 hollow sphere, forming sandwich-type B2O3@BPO4 hollow spheres."

          The B2O3@BPO4 material exhibits a unique 3-D dispersed active site structure within a porous framework. The key structural characteristics that enhance catalytic performance include:

1. Sandwich-like hollow sphere structure: BPO4 hollow spheres serve as the support, with B2O3 nanowires covering both the inside and outside surfaces. This structure provides a large surface area, high loading capacity, and efficient utilization of both inner and outer surfaces.

2. 3-D dispersion of active sites: B2O3 nanowires cover both the inside and outside of the BPO4 hollow spheres, allowing for better dispersion and utilization of active sites.

3. High-temperature liquid phase: At reaction temperatures above 450°C, the B2O3 component melts, acting as a supported liquid-phase catalyst. This combines the advantages of homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysis.

4. Thermal stability: The BPO4 support stabilizes the liquid B2O3 phase at high temperatures, providing excellent stability up to 550°C.

5. Improved mass transfer: The hollow structure may facilitate better mass transfer during catalytic reactions.

The method used to incorporate B active components into this structure is a one-step template-free synthesis. This approach is highly effective and innovative for several reasons:

1. Simplicity: No need for templates or post-processing steps, making it more efficient than traditional methods.

2. Direct formation of the desired structure: The sandwich-like hollow spheres are formed in a single step, with B2O3 naturally covering the BPO4 hollow spheres as they cool.

3. Overcoming challenges: This method successfully creates a sandwich-like structure in hollow spheres, which has been difficult to achieve at the micro/nanoscale.

4. Versatility: The method can potentially be adapted for other similar catalyst systems.

This synthesis method is particularly effective for high-temperature catalytic applications, such as the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propene. The resulting catalyst shows excellent productivity and stability at temperatures up to 550°C, outperforming many metal-based catalysts.

However, the effectiveness of this method for other catalytic applications may vary depending on the specific reaction requirements, operating conditions, and the suitability of B2O3 as an active component. For reactions requiring lower temperatures or different active species, alternative synthesis methods might be more suitable.

In conclusion, the one-step template-free synthesis of B2O3@BPO4 sandwich-like hollow spheres effectively creates a 3-D dispersed active site structure that enhances catalytic performance, particularly for high-temperature applications. Future research could explore the adaptability of this method to other catalyst systems and reaction conditions.

          B2O3@BPO4材料在多孔框架中展现出独特的三维分散活性位点结构。增强催化性能的关键结构特征包括：

1. 三明治状中空球结构：BPO4中空球作为支撑体，B2O3纳米线覆盖在内外表面。这种结构提供了大的表面积、高载荷能力，并实现了内外表面的高效利用。

2. 活性位点的三维分散：B2O3纳米线覆盖在BPO4中空球的内外表面，实现了活性位点的更好分散和利用。

3. 高温液相：在450°C以上的反应温度下，B2O3组分熔化，作为负载型液相催化剂。这结合了均相和多相催化的优点。

4. 热稳定性：BPO4支撑体在高温下稳定液态B2O3相，提供了高达550°C的优异稳定性。

5. 改善传质：中空结构可能有助于催化反应过程中的更好传质。

将B活性组分引入这种结构的方法是一步无模板合成。这种方法非常有效和创新，原因如下：

1. 简单性：不需要模板或后处理步骤，比传统方法更高效。

2. 直接形成所需结构：三明治状中空球在单一步骤中形成，B2O3在冷却过程中自然覆盖在BPO4中空球上。

3. 克服挑战：该方法成功地在中空球中创建了三明治状结构，这在微/纳米尺度上一直是具有挑战性的。

4. 多功能性：该方法可能适用于其他类似的催化剂系统。

这种合成方法特别适用于高温催化应用，如丙烷到丙烯的氧化脱氢。所得催化剂在高达550°C的温度下表现出优异的生产力和稳定性，优于许多金属基催化剂。

然而，这种方法对其他催化应用的有效性可能会因特定的反应要求、操作条件以及B2O3作为活性组分的适用性而有所不同。对于需要较低温度或不同活性物种的反应，其他合成方法可能更合适。

总之，B2O3@BPO4三明治状中空球的一步法无模板合成有效地创建了一种三维分散活性位点结构，增强了催化性能，特别适用于高温应用。未来的研究可以探索这种方法对其他催化剂系统和反应条件的适应性。
