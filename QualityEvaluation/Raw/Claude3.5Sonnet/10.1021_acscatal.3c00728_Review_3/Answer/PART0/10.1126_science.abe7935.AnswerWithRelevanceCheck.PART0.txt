          [1] "We report a new active center with a B[OHO(H)Si]2 structure in the borosilicate MFI framework (BS-1) for this reaction that contains only isolated boron species, which differs from general catalysts containing BOB oligomers."

[2] "Such a structure not only efficiently activates molecular oxygen and propane to promote dehydrogenation but also hinders full boron hydrolysis during catalysis."

[3] "The BS-1 catalyst was identified by x-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern and N2 sorption isotherms, exhibiting typical characteristics in its MFI structure"

[4] "Energy dispersive spectroscopic elemental maps of the BS-1 catalyst revealed uniform distribution of boron species on the silica matrix"

[5] "The unusual catalytic performance of BS-1 motivated our investigation of the structure using 11B magic angle spinning (MAS) nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy"

[6] "The BS-1 catalyst retained this ability after the equivalent treatment (Fig. 1C). Further evaluation of the durability of the BS-1 catalyst was performed in a continuous ODHP test with high propane conversion (32.9 to 43.7%) that might produce 10 vol% water in the gas."

[7] "The zeolite structure was maintained and boron leaching was almost negligible in the reaction for 208 hours, as confirmed by the ICP analysis, N2 sorption, XRD pattern, SEM images, and TEM images of the used catalyst"

[8] "The BS-1 catalyst was synthesized from a solvent-free crystallization strategy in the presence of tetrapropylammonium (TPA+) hydroxide from a synthesis gel at 180C for 3 days."

          The structural characteristics of B-based materials with 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks include:

1. Isolated boron species: The BS-1 catalyst contains isolated boron species in a B[OHO(H)Si]2 structure within the borosilicate MFI framework, differing from conventional catalysts with BOB oligomers.

2. Uniform distribution: Boron species are uniformly distributed throughout the silica matrix, ensuring efficient utilization of active sites.

3. Microporous structure: The MFI zeolite structure provides a confined environment that may contribute to enhanced catalytic activity.

4. Stability: The zeolite framework maintains its structure during long-term catalytic use, with minimal boron leaching.

These features enhance catalytic performance by:

1. Efficient activation: The isolated boron structure efficiently activates molecular oxygen and propane, promoting dehydrogenation reactions.

2. Hydrolysis resistance: The framework hinders full boron hydrolysis during catalysis, contributing to improved durability and water tolerance.

3. High durability: The catalyst retains its structure and performance over extended periods (208 hours) with minimal boron leaching.

The method used to incorporate B active components into these structures involves a solvent-free crystallization strategy using tetrapropylammonium hydroxide at 180°C for 3 days. This approach appears to be effective for creating isolated boron sites within the zeolite structure, which is crucial for the catalyst's performance in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP).

This synthesis method's effectiveness lies in its ability to create well-dispersed, isolated boron sites that resist agglomeration and maintain stability under reaction conditions. For ODHP applications, this approach shows significant promise due to the resulting catalyst's high activity, selectivity, and durability.

However, the effectiveness of this method for other catalytic applications would depend on the specific reaction requirements and desired catalyst properties. Further research would be needed to determine its suitability for different catalytic processes and to compare it with alternative methods of incorporating boron into porous frameworks.

          具有三维分散活性位点的B基材料在多孔框架中的结构特征包括：

1. 孤立的硼物种：BS-1催化剂在硼硅酸盐MFI框架中含有B[OHO(H)Si]2结构的孤立硼物种，与传统的含有BOB寡聚物的催化剂不同。

2. 均匀分布：硼物种在硅基质中均匀分布，确保了活性位点的高效利用。

3. 微孔结构：MFI沸石结构提供了一个受限环境，可能有助于提高催化活性。

4. 稳定性：沸石框架在长期催化使用过程中保持其结构，硼的流失最小。

这些特征通过以下方式增强催化性能：

1. 高效活化：孤立的硼结构能够高效活化分子氧和丙烷，促进脱氢反应。

2. 抗水解性：框架结构抑制了催化过程中硼的完全水解，提高了耐久性和抗水性。

3. 高耐久性：催化剂在长时间（208小时）内保持其结构和性能，硼浸出最小。

将B活性组分引入这些结构的方法涉及使用四丙基铵氢氧化物在180°C下进行3天的无溶剂结晶策略。这种方法似乎能有效地在沸石结构中创建孤立的硼位点，这对催化剂在丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）中的性能至关重要。

这种合成方法的有效性在于其能够创建分散良好、孤立的硼位点，这些位点能够抵抗聚集并在反应条件下保持稳定。对于ODHP应用，由于所得催化剂具有高活性、选择性和耐久性，这种方法显示出重要的前景。

然而，这种方法对其他催化应用的有效性将取决于特定反应的要求和所需的催化剂性质。需要进行进一步的研究来确定其对不同催化过程的适用性，并将其与其他将硼引入多孔框架的替代方法进行比较。
