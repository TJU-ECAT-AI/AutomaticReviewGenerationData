[1] "Borosilicate zeolites are the active catalysts in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP), which provide an ideal platform to explore the origin of catalytic activity for boron-containing catalysts as well as the construction of highly active boron centers."

[2] "The incompletely crystallized MFI-type borosilicate zeolite catalyst displays extraordinary performance in ODHP, exhibiting an olefin productivity of 4.75 golefin gcat1 h1 under low reaction temperature (445 C) and high weight-hour-space-velocity (WHSV, 37.6 gC3H8 gcat1 h1)."

[3] "A combination of solid-state NMR, dual-beam FTIR, and in-situ DRIFT measurements reveal that the boron species are anchored to the zeolite matrix in the form of open coordination."

[4] "The ample SiOH groups on the surface facilitate the formation of hydrogen bonds with the BOH in defective boron species and inhibit the excessive leaching of boron."

[5] "During the ODHP process, the isolated boron species would dynamically transform into aggregated ones, being closely related to the increased catalytic activity."

[6] "The BOH groups in aggregated BOx species that hydrogen bond with adjacent SiOH groups are identified as the active center and high efficiency in catalyzing ODHP reaction at low temperature."

[7] "Enabling boron species to be uniformly anchored to hydroxyl-rich MFI-type zeolite matrix in oligomeric form may be a feasible way to construct highly active boron centers."

[8] "The crystallinity was regulated by adjusting the hydrothermal synthesis conditions. It turned out to be that the catalysts with low crystallinity exhibited superior activity and higher productivity of olefin at low temperature."

[1] "We report a new active center with a B[OHO(H)Si]2 structure in the borosilicate MFI framework (BS-1) for this reaction that contains only isolated boron species, which differs from general catalysts containing BOB oligomers."

[2] "Such a structure not only efficiently activates molecular oxygen and propane to promote dehydrogenation but also hinders full boron hydrolysis during catalysis."

[3] "The BS-1 catalyst was identified by x-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern and N2 sorption isotherms, exhibiting typical characteristics in its MFI structure"

[4] "Energy dispersive spectroscopic elemental maps of the BS-1 catalyst revealed uniform distribution of boron species on the silica matrix"

[5] "The unusual catalytic performance of BS-1 motivated our investigation of the structure using 11B magic angle spinning (MAS) nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy"

[6] "The BS-1 catalyst retained this ability after the equivalent treatment (Fig. 1C). Further evaluation of the durability of the BS-1 catalyst was performed in a continuous ODHP test with high propane conversion (32.9 to 43.7%) that might produce 10 vol% water in the gas."

[7] "The zeolite structure was maintained and boron leaching was almost negligible in the reaction for 208 hours, as confirmed by the ICP analysis, N2 sorption, XRD pattern, SEM images, and TEM images of the used catalyst"

[8] "The BS-1 catalyst was synthesized from a solvent-free crystallization strategy in the presence of tetrapropylammonium (TPA+) hydroxide from a synthesis gel at 180C for 3 days."

[1] "The B-based materials with 3-D dispersed active sites generally exhibit porous structures and high specific surface areas."

[2] "The high specific surface area and suitable pore volume provide abundant sites to accommodate the active B species and confined space that influences the reaction behavior of radicals."

[3] "Loading the B active components on the surface of the 3-D porous structure or doping them into the 3-D framework of the porous materials constitutes an effective method to construct 3-D B active sites."

[4] "By doping B species into zeolite frameworks, a 3-D dispersion of the B active site can be achieved."

[5] "The loading of B active species in the 3-D porous materials or doping into the zeolite frameworks not only provides a higher utility of B active sites but also constructs confined space which regulates the reaction behaviors of active radical intermediates and mass transport behaviors"

[6] "The introduction of confined walls is able to directly increase the wall termination possibility of the gas-phase radicals, which exhibits a negative effect on the reaction rate."

[7] "As the confinement also influences the diffusion of reactants, radical intermediates, and products, predicting the net effect of the 3-D dispersion of active sites on the apparent catalytic performances is difficult."

[8] "The 3-D pore structure of zeolite played an important role in the conversion of propane, which could affect the mass and heat transport."

[9] "The suitable 3-D pore structures render ordered macroporous boron phosphate a very promising catalyst for propane oxidative dehydrogenation, and it is expected to meet the industrial standard."

[1] "Zeolites are one of the most common catalyst supports, and widely used in industry due to its large internal surface areas, micropores of molecular dimension, and high thermal stabilities"

[2] "Layered borosilicate zeolites were synthesized."

[3] "The presence of boron in the framework was confirmed by the FT-IR spectra"

[4] "The bands at 1405 and 926 cm1 were assigned to trigonally and tetrahedrally coordinated boron respectively"

[5] "11B MAS NMR spectra of as-prepared BZEO-2 and after different reaction intervals were measured"

[6] "At least five types of major B species (B[3]a, B[3]b, B[3]c, B[4]a and B[4]b) present in the catalysts."

[7] "The peaks at 18, 15 and 11 ppm were ascribed to tri-coordinated boron which denoted as B[3]a, B[3]b and B[3]c respectively."

[8] "Sites B[3]b and B[3]c were assigned to framework B(OSi)xOH3-x(x=1,2) and B(OSi)3 structure"

[9] "The sharp peaks at around 0 ppm and 2.8 ppm were accordingly assigned to B(OH)2(OSi)2 and B(OSi)4 tetrahedral framework, donated as B[4]a and B[4]b"

[10] "We postulate that B[3]a and B[3]b are responsible for the ODH activity."

[11] "The N2 adsorption-desorption isotherms of different boron-containing MWW-typed zeolites exhibited nearly type-I shape (Fig. 2b), featuring predominantly micropores with a small proportion of interstitial mesopores."

[12] "As seen in Fig. 2a, the X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns showed four main diffraction peaks at 2θ = 7.21, 8.02, 10.10 and 26.33, corresponding to the known (1 0 0), (1 0 1), (1 0 2) and (3 1 0) reflections of ERB-1, which confirmed the MWW structure"

[1] "BN@BPO4 self-supporting monolithic foam with oriented bowl-like structure was obtained, which is built by numerous oriented bowl-like blocks and shows a double layer structure with face-to-face opening."

[2] "Further, pure h-BN monolithic foam with oriented bowl-like structure prepared at higher temperature possessed multimodal hierarchically porous structure and excellent performance in the catalytic oxidative dehydrogenation of propane into propene and the removal of organic pollutants."

[3] "Bowl-like structures have great potential in the field of catalysis, environmental remediation, energy storage, etc., because of the large surface area, porous structure, and buffer hollow space."

[4] "We believe the as-generated h-BN can enhance the gas trapping capacity of liquid B2O3 environment foam to precisely control pressure differential between large and small bubbles and thus favors the oriented opening of bowl-like structure."

"Carbon nanofibres (CNFs) were modified with B and P by an exsitu approach. In addition, CNFs doped with N were prepared insitu using ethylenediamine as the N and C source."

"B-CNFs with different B loadings were prepared by the incipient wetness impregnation of aqueous boric acid solutions. Subsequently, the B-CNFs were calcined at 773K as the standard temperature in N2 atmosphere."

"Both the surface area and pore volume (Table1) increase after doping with only minor amounts of B (0.5wt% B). Further B doping diminishes the surface area and pore volume slightly, but the values are still larger than those for pristine CNFs."

"This suggests that boron does not plug the pores of the original CNFs, but instead covers the pore walls. The increased surface area and pore volume could be explained tentatively by the etching of some amorphous carbon during calcination at 773K in the presence of boric acid."

"The thermal stability increases by approximately 80K after only 0.5wt% B is deposited. The increase in thermal resistance is only marginal for further B loading."

"As the calcination temperature increases, the peak widens to higher BEs if the material is calcined above 973K and additionally widens to lower BEs if the material is calcined at a higher temperature of 1173K. This suggests that new B species develop as the calcination temperature increases."

"Pristine CNFs and CNFs with different B loadings were characterised texturally by N2 physisorption. All the isotherms are of Type IV with hysteresis loops at high relative pressures indicative of mesoporous materials."

"The samples exhibit a broad pore size distribution with a peak maximum at 58nm for pristine CNFs and at 80nm for CNFs after B doping (FigureS2)."

"Based on XPS assignments in the literature, after deconvolution of the spectra shown in Figure2, the peaks can be attributed to several B species summarised in Table2 and represented schematically in FigureS4."

"A peak at BE=192.7eV (B1), which is the predominant peak in B-CNF calcined at 673 and 773K, can be attributed to B linked to three O atoms isolated or a (BO3)n chain bonded to the zig-zag face of the graphite lattice (FigureS4a)."

[1] "Boron-based metal-free catalysts for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) have drawn great attention in both academia and industry due to their impressive activity and olefin selectivity."

[2] "SiO2 obtained by TEOS hydrolysis acts as a media layer to bridge the cordierite substrate and boron oxide via abundant SiOH groups."

[3] "The well-developed straight channels of honeycomb cordierite make it possible to carry out the reactor under high gas hourly space velocity (GHSV) and the thin wash-coated B2O3 layer can effectively facilitate the pore diffusion on the catalyst."

[4] "The prepared B2O3/SiO2@HC monolithic catalyst exhibits good catalytic performance at low boron oxide loading and achieves excellent propylene selectivity (86.0%), olefin selectivity (97.6%, propylene and ethylene) and negligible CO2 (0.1%) at 16.9% propane conversion under high GHSV of 345,600ml·(g B2O3)1·h1"

[5] "To solve this problem, the cordierite support was modified by an additional silica coating layer which can attach firmly on the cordierite substrate possibly by forming SiOAl, SiOMg, SiOSi bonds, and attach to the boron oxide layer via SiOB bonds."

[1] "It is demonstrated that the chromium catalysts supported on MCF exhibit much higher catalytic activity in terms of propane conversion and propylene yield than literature results obtained over chromium-supported mesoporous SBA-15 or MCM-41 catalysts during the ODH of propane."

          [2] "Enhanced catalytic performance of the chromium-containing mesoporous MCF catalysts has been attributed to the unique three-dimensional (3D), continuous, ultralarge mesopore structure of the MCF materials, which allow a much faster internal molecular transport during the ODH of propane."

          [3] "A series of chromium-containing mesocellular silica foam (MCF) catalysts have been prepared and characterized in the oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of propane between 350 and 600 C."

[1] "Silicon boride (SiB3-6), a metal-free material enriching in boron sites, exhibits good oxidation resistance property at high temperature and could be as a potential catalyst for ODH of light alkanes."

[2] "The stability was evidenced by the operation of a 100-h test with steady conversion and product selectivity."

[3] "The difference of selectivity between silicon boride with other boron-containing catalysts maybe resulted from the different subsurface structure"

[4] "To further identify the active sites, the structure evolution of the silicon boride catalyst before and after activation was characterized by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis."

[5] "Upon exposure to the ODH of propane reaction (535C), the surface oxygen concentrations increased to 50.4% after 1h (SiB-1h) and 54.8% after 3h (SiB-3h)"

[6] "The functionalised silicon boride showed high ODH activity for light alkanes; more importantly, the antioxidant ability of silicon boride ensured the catalytic stability."

[7] "To better understand the activation and reaction process, XRD measurement was performed to trace the structure evolution of the silicon boride catalyst under different conditions, including heated to 535C, activated in oxygen or reaction atmosphere and then cooled to room temperature"

[8] "After being subjected to ODH reaction, the catalyst retained the bulk structure of silicon boride (Fig. S1), suggesting that the oxyfunctionalization may only occur on the surface of catalyst."

[9] "Furthermore, a higher binding energy of the B 1s signal located at 193.8eV was detected for SiB-1h and SiB-3h catalysts, which was assigned to the boron oxide (B2O3, Fig. 2 b)."

[1] "Boron nitride was first impregnated with 1m sodium nitrite aqueous solution, followed by steam (5vol.% H2O/N2) activation at 530C for 3h; the resulting sample (BNOH) was washed with aqueous ammonia and finally calcined at 500C for 2h in air."

[2] "The BNOH catalyst inherited a hexagonal layered structure of boron nitride (FigureS3). Aberration-corrected transmission electron microscopy (TEM) analyses identified the in-plane lattice retained its hexagonal symmetry with a large number of edges that were newly created during steam activation"

[3] "X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis identified that the surface concentrations of boron and oxygen were 44.3% and 9.2% (Figure2c), respectively. There were two types of boron species (Figure2c); one was coordinated with nitrogen on the flat surface whereas the other was bonded to oxygen at the edge."

[4] "There were two types of boronoxygen bonding at 26.0 and 24.4ppm; the former represents the edge boron sites bonded to two bridging oxygen atoms, and the latter corresponded to BOH bonding, which was identified by the sharp 1H resonance at 1.2ppm in the 1H MAS NMR spectrum"

[5] "The BOH groups at the edges of boron nitride selectively activate the CH bond in propane and simultaneously suppress the overoxidation of propylene into CO2."

"One-dimensional nanomaterials have attracted considerable attention for applications in catalysis because of their conducive to the transmission of substances and the potential for highly active site exposure."

"The chemical and physical properties of nanofibers prepared by the electrospinning method can be easily adjusted by changing conditions in the electrospinning process."

"Meanwhile, there is good interaction between the nanoparticles and the support in the nanocatalyst prepared by the electrospinning method to further ensure their activity, selectivity, and long-term stability."

"The TEM and STEM-EDX mapping images of the h-BN/SiO2 nanofiber catalyst (Figure2fh) showed that the h-BN was uniformly dispersed on the dense SiO2 support."

"The higher activity for the h-BN/SiO2 nanofiber catalyst was mainly because that the one-dimensional structure facilitated active site exposure, participating in the catalysis and achieving a higher conversion."

"Fibrous nanomaterials have drawn considerable attention in the field of catalysis due to the promoted utilization of the surface and facilitated mass transfer process."

"The key is to prepare uniform sols consisting of exfoliated h-BN. The diameters of the nanofiber catalysts can be tuned in the range of 150300nm through h-BN loading change."

"The obtained h-BN/SiO2 nanofiber exhibited a macroscopical film and fibrous microstructure (Figure1b). Besides, some knots were observed in the nanofiber structure, indicating that a few large sizes of particles were involved in the prepared nanofiber, consistent with SEM images of exfoliated h-BN."

[1] "Energy-filtered transmission electron microscopy (EF-TEM) shows that both boron and oxygen are highly dispersed throughout the CNT substrate"

[2] "The composite is stable under reaction conditions, and all of the B2O3 (1.7atom% B for 5B-oCNT) could be detected by electron energy-loss spectroscopy (EELS) after use in ODH"

[3] "Owing to the chosen preparation method, the majority of amorphous B2O3 is deposited in the cavity and on the tips of CNTs. Only a minor fraction of the outer CNT surface is covered by an amorphous coating of about 12nm thickness, whereas a highly dispersed sub-monolayer deposition of BOx species is expected to be omnipresent"

[4] "The good thermal stability of the doped samples during TPO indicates a covalent bonding to the CNT structure, whereas the B2O3/P2O5 filling of the CNTs acts as a backbone against oxidation."

[5] "Apart from the suppressed total combustion reaction on the modified CNTs, a further reason for enhanced propene selectivity may also be the lower reoxidation capacity of active sites. Boron oxide as an electron-deficient promoter tends to inhibit the dissociative adsorption of O2 and thus sustains the selective oxygen species on the catalyst surface."

[6] "B- and P-modified samples were prepared by incipient wetness impregnation of oCNTs (6mLg1) using aqueous solutions of (NH4)2B10O168H2O and (NH4)2HPO4 (Sigma Aldrich, >99%), to achieve loadings of between x=0.003 and 5wt% B2O3 or 5wt% P2O5."

[7] "B2O3-modified CNTs deactivate to a small extent initially, which may be due to the decomposition or thermal spreading of the deposited B2O3 precursor."

[1] "Compared with crystalline zeolite with microporous structure and saturated coordination framework atoms, embryonic zeolitic materials have the feature of extra-large microporosity with several unit cell dimensions of size."

[2] "The greatly exposed small unit cells allow guest molecules easy to diffuse and the extra-large micropores improve the efficiency of mass transfer and accessibility of the active sites."

[3] "More importantly, after embedding boron atoms, the defect-rich zeolitic structures offer abundant SiOH and BOH groups, which contributed to the stabilization of boron species and construction of active boron centers with proton transfer with adjacent SiOH through hydrogen bonds."

[4] "Boron-containing zeolites have been proven potential in catalyzing the oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) process and the boron sites in open coordination are considered as the active center."

[5] "Solid-state NMR reveals the formation of boron sites in open coordination derived from the defect-rich structure of embryonic borosilicate zeolite, guaranteeing ample exposure of the active center."

[6] "The silanol-rich structure was shown to disperse boron species and limit their detachment from the catalytic system through the redispersion of over-hydrolyzed boron species."

[7] "Structure characterizations and kinetic measurements revealed that the H-bonded BOH groups in defect tri-coordination boron species were responsible for activating propane on the catalysts surface and gas phase, and the reactions in the gas phase were mainly responsible for the high performance in ODHP reaction."

[1] "Electrospinning was employed for the synthesis of one-dimensional porous boron-doped silica nanofiber (PBSN) catalysts in one step."

[2] "The TEM image of PBSN-3 (Fig. 1(c)) shows a porous structure associated with a homogeneous distribution of Si, B, and O elements in the entire catalyst"

[3] "The N2 physical sorption isotherms of the PBSN catalysts (Fig. 2(a)) showed a type-IV shape, indicating their accessible mesoporous characteristics."

[4] "The 11B NMR analysis showed that the tri- and tetra-coordinated boron species were immobilized on the catalysts via BOSi bridges, which is consistent with the FTIR results."

[5] "B2O3 signals were not observed, suggesting that the B2O3 species may be highly dispersed in the fiber structure, together with the results of STEM-EDX mapping."

[6] "The one-dimensional nanofibers with open pore structures not only prevented diffusion limitation but also guaranteed high catalytic activity at high weight hourly space velocity (WHSV) in the ODH of alkanes."

[7] "Compared to other supported boron oxide catalysts, PBSN catalysts showed higher olefin selectivity and stability."

[1] "Here, we present both hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) and boron nitride nanotubes (BNNTs) as metal-free materials able to catalyze the ODHP reaction."

[2] "BNNTs exhibit a rate of propane consumption (mol C3H8 kg-cat1 s1) more than one order of magnitude as high as that observed with h-BN (fig. S4). The higher activity of BNNTs at least partially reflects the higher surface area of BNNTs relative to h-BN (BNNT, 97  5 m2 g1 versus h-BN, 16  1 m2 g1)"

[3] "From the combination of catalytic activity, spectroscopic data, and DFT calculations and in line with the observed oxygen-dependence of the kinetics, we therefore propose that an oxygen molecule bonded to one B and one N [an oxygen-terminated armchair edge of BN (>BOON<)] acts as active site for the ODHP reaction."

[4] "We consider that the observed high olefin selectivity may largely be due to the stabilization of the propyl radical by the nitroxyl radical site. Indeed, the one-dimensional (1D) nature of this edge avoids the creation of a highly reactive propyl radical (typical of 0D single-site catalysts) (34), and also the overoxidation of the adsorbed species (typical of 2D surface catalysts) is suppressed (35)."

"B2O3@BPO4 sandwich-like hollow spheres were synthesized via a one-step template-free method."

"At reaction temperatures (>450 C), melted B2O3 supported on the surface of BPO4 hollow spheres acts as a catalytically active species for the selective oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propene, with an excellent productivity of 0.79 gC3H6 gcat1 h1 and a high stability at 550 C."

"Herein, we present a B2O3@BPO4 composite with a sandwich-like hollow sphere structure produced using a one-step template-free method without any postprocessing. The sandwich-like B2O3 composite consists of BPO4 hollow spheres covered with B2O3 nanowires at room temperature."

"For traditional supported catalysts, to gain more active sites, hollow micro-/nanostructured materials with low density, large surface area, and high loading capacity are often used as supports"

"Commonly, the maximum utilization of the two sides of planar supports is allowed by sandwich-like structures, but sandwich-like structures are rarely used in hollow-sphere structures due to the difficulty of capsulation at micro-/nanoscale."

"During the cooling process, liquid B2O3 cools down and solidifies into nanowires covering both the inside and outside of the BPO4 hollow sphere, forming sandwich-type B2O3@BPO4 hollow spheres."

"Solid-state NMR spectroscopy of hydrothermally synthesized B-MWW reveals that boron is fully incorporated into the zeolite framework as trivalent BO3 units. These isolated sites are inactive for oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of propane, which refutes the hypothesis that site-isolated boron species are the active site on boron-containing ODH catalysts."

"Using 11B solid-state NMR spectroscopy, we show that the majority of boron species in B-MWW exist as isolated BO3 units, fully incorporated into the zeolite framework. However, this material shows no catalytic activity for ODH of propane to propene."

"B-MWW was hydrothermally synthesized according to an established literature procedure"

"Based upon the analytical simulations, B(OSi)3 units make up ca. 90% of the boron incorporated into the framework. The peak with δiso(11B) = 15 ppm and ca. 10% integrated intensity is assigned to a B(OSi)2(OH) species consisting of two bonds to the framework and a terminal hydroxide."

"In summary, the 11B chemical shifts suggest that in B-MWW nearly all boron atoms are incorporated into the framework. The SSNMR data also suggests that these sites are well separated (>34Å apart) from one another, for the reasons given below."

"All of these observations confirm the hypothesis that catalytically inactive B-MWW consist of predominately isolated boron sites incorporated into the zeolite framework, while the active ODH catalyst B/B-MWW contains some partially aggregated boron sites."

"The difference in boron sites in B-MWW and these other boron materials leads us to the important conclusion that the boron-catalyzed ODH of propane does not proceed over an isolated BO3 site. Rather, active boron-based ODH catalysts likely requires boron species with some degree of B-O-B connectivity."

"Boron oxide embedded in zeolites Zeolites are crystalline aluminosilicate materials with three-dimensional network containing channels and cavities of molecular dimensions, and the presence of Al in tetrahedra makes the framework negatively charged."

"Recently, layered borosilicate zeolite (ERB-1, MWW structure) with defective trigonal boron species was reported as a highly active and selective catalyst for the ODH of propane to take advantage of their specific morphology inherent with large internal surface areas, micropore structure and high thermal stability."

"In these synthesized zeolites, the boron species were classified into five types according to solid-state 11B MAS NMR, i.e. framework trigonal B(OSi)xOH3x(x=1,2), B(OSi)3, tetrahedral B(OH)2(OSi)2, B(OSi)4 and aggregated terminal BOH species"

"Isomorphous substitution of tri- or tetravalent metal atoms (Al, Ti, Fe and V) by borosilicate zeolites is a good route in the production of some new zeolites that need expensive organic structure directing agents (OSDAs), long crystallization time or co-presence of dopant."

"Furthermore, taking advantage of the high propensity of boron to hydrolyze, its presence benefits the fabrication of mesoporous zeolite, and may increase the mesopore volume by 46%."

"Lu and coworkers synthesized mesoporous silica-supported boron oxide catalysts (B2O3/SBA-15) and identified four B species by using the 11B NMR technique"

"In order to improve the exposure of active sites and the mass transfer, a three-dimensional ordered macroporous BPO4 material was developed with a robust framework, which exhibited excellent activity and selectivity in the ODH of propane"

"A B2O3@BPO4 sandwich-like hollow sphere was reported as a liquid-phase catalyst in ODH of propane, and remained stable for 27 h at 550 C with a C3H6 productivity of 0.79 gC3H6 gcat1 h1"

"The preparation of a boron nitride wash-coated monolithic catalyst49 offered an applicable way to improve, besides the olefin selectivity, the heat and mass transfer which is vital for industrialization owing to the intrinsic feature of high exothermicity of the ODH reaction that could produce hotspots and thus subsequent negative consequences in the olefin selectivity and safety issues."

"By means of similar strategies, functionalized silicon boride, supported B2O3 on high surface area SBA-15, and ordered macroporous boron phosphate were also reported with remarkable performance in the ODH of light alkanes."

"For h-BN, the edge-hydroxylation of BN, synthesis of BN with boric acid and dicyanamide, and assembly of 2D BN nanosheets into 3D ordered architectures were reported as effective ways to enhance the catalytic activity of BN."

"When using dicyanamide to substitute for urea in the preparation for high surface area boron nitride, its enhanced catalytic performance was maintained in the ODH of propane in view of the 53% propylene selectivity and 18% ethylene selectivity at a 52% propane conversion."

"Recently, the discovery that hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) selectively oxidized propane to propylene with only negligible CO2 formation broke through the restriction of this process."

"Rational etching and chemical modifications on the surface of catalysts are critical for improving activity and understanding the reaction mechanism."

"High energy species (radicals, ions, and electrons) in plasma are capable of modifying surface property and composition of catalytic materials through breaking surface chemical bonds and reacting with surface atoms to form new chemical bonds."

"N2-BN exhibited a remarkable ODH reaction performance (26.0% propane conversion and 89.4% olefins selectivity)"

"The enhanced reactivity was closely related to the increased N-defects."

"Two types of N-defects (TBC and OBC) were generated during plasma treatment while TBC possibly preferred to become active BOx species under the ODH atmosphere and further converted propane to propylene."

"Spectroscopy demonstrated that three-boron center N-defects in the catalyst played a pivotal role in facilitating the conversion of propane."

"As an efficient up-to-down synthesis method, plasma technology not only provides a feasible way for the design of functionalized or defects-rich catalysts but also deepens the comprehension of active sites."

[1] "Ordered macroporous materials have an extremely favorable architecture, which can improve mass transport, reduce diffusion limitations, and expose a large number of active sites"

[2] "The ordered macroporous structure was an inverse replica of the template, with an average diameter of 200 nm for the interconnected macropores"

[3] "BPO4(OM) possessed abundant and fully interconnected macropores with a large volume."

[4] "The interconnected and open macropores of BPO4 are beneficial to the mass transfer to allow the active sites easily accessible and lead to better catalytic efficiency under high space velocity conditions"

[5] "The tri-coordinated surface boron species were identified as the active catalytic sites for the ODH of propane."

[6] "The content of tri-coordinated surface boron species increased from ca. 41% in fresh BPO4(OM) to 51% in the spent catalyst"

[7] "The interconnected macropores of the BPO4(OM) sample were formed through the inverse templating effect of the polybenzoxazine polymer spheres, consisting of a matrix of macropores bridged by ink-bottle neck-like channels of 80 nm in diameter."

[8] "The presence of the excess electron density in its vicinity is expected to perturb the binding strength of 1s electron and shift the bind energy to a lower value. The tetra-coordinated boron species represented the transition region to extend the bulk structure to the surface."

[9] "The tri-coordinated B site has less electron density in its vicinity than the tetra-coordinated B site since in these species B always remained with a former oxidation state of +3, which was neutralized when being tri-coordinated while felt excess negative charge when tetra-coordinated."

"Hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) is a burgeoning catalyst for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) with impressive light olefins selectivity, which deserves further study to optimize the heat and mass transfer process with the aim of promoting the potential industrial application since ODHP is a highly exothermic process."

"The typical structure of h-BN/Cordierite with well-developed straight-channel and short diffusive pathway of the thin wash-coated h-BN layer guarantee the mass transfer process at high GHSV, achieving a high propylene space time yield of 18.6 gC3H6 gBN−1h−1 and improving the selectivity towards propylene and ethylene by suppressing secondary reactions of deep oxidation."

"The well-developed straight-channel structure of h-BN/Cordierite provides space for gas phase radical reactions, thus, propane conversion over h-BN/Cordierite is higher than that over h-BN powder."

"h-BN wash-coated cordierite monolithic catalyst was designed through a chemical vapor deposition method using boron acid and urea as precursors"

"Considering that the cordierite was composed of Al2O3, MgO and SiO2, hydroxyl groups will present on the surface of cordierite. The hydrogen bonds interaction can be formed between the surface OH of cordierite and BOH groups of H3BO3. In addition, CVD process could strength the interaction of boron species with cordierite in the form of BOSi and BOAl, which contributes to the outstanding adhesiveness between h-BN layer and cordierite."

[1] "Boron-based catalysts exhibit high alkene selectivity in ODHP, but the understanding of catalytic mechanism remains incomplete, especially regarding the observed supra-linear reaction order of alkanes."

[2] "We studied the impact of spatial confinement on the performance and kinetics of boron oxide supported on silica with different pore structures."

[3] "The formation rate of propylene decreases with the degree of confinement of active boron sites derived from the support."

[4] "The apparent activation energy increases with the ODHP activity, and exhibits a positive correlation with the apparent propane reaction order."

[5] "The apparent propane order of B2O3/SiO2 varies from 1 to 3, which is impacted by pore structure of supports, loading of B2O3, and partial pressure of propane."

[1] "Borosilicate zeolites are the active catalysts in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP), which provide an ideal platform to explore the origin of catalytic activity for boron-containing catalysts as well as the construction of highly active boron centers."

[2] "The incompletely crystallized MFI-type borosilicate zeolite catalyst displays extraordinary performance in ODHP, exhibiting an olefin productivity of 4.75 golefin gcat1 h1 under low reaction temperature (445 C) and high weight-hour-space-velocity (WHSV, 37.6 gC3H8 gcat1 h1)."

[3] "A combination of solid-state NMR, dual-beam FTIR, and in-situ DRIFT measurements reveal that the boron species are anchored to the zeolite matrix in the form of open coordination."

[4] "The ample SiOH groups on the surface facilitate the formation of hydrogen bonds with the BOH in defective boron species and inhibit the excessive leaching of boron."

[5] "During the ODHP process, the isolated boron species would dynamically transform into aggregated ones, being closely related to the increased catalytic activity."

[6] "The BOH groups in aggregated BOx species that hydrogen bond with adjacent SiOH groups are identified as the active center and high efficiency in catalyzing ODHP reaction at low temperature."

[7] "Enabling boron species to be uniformly anchored to hydroxyl-rich MFI-type zeolite matrix in oligomeric form may be a feasible way to construct highly active boron centers."

[8] "The crystallinity was regulated by adjusting the hydrothermal synthesis conditions. It turned out to be that the catalysts with low crystallinity exhibited superior activity and higher productivity of olefin at low temperature."

[1] "We report a new active center with a B[OHO(H)Si]2 structure in the borosilicate MFI framework (BS-1) for this reaction that contains only isolated boron species, which differs from general catalysts containing BOB oligomers."

[2] "Such a structure not only efficiently activates molecular oxygen and propane to promote dehydrogenation but also hinders full boron hydrolysis during catalysis."

[3] "The BS-1 catalyst was identified by x-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern and N2 sorption isotherms, exhibiting typical characteristics in its MFI structure"

[4] "Energy dispersive spectroscopic elemental maps of the BS-1 catalyst revealed uniform distribution of boron species on the silica matrix"

[5] "The unusual catalytic performance of BS-1 motivated our investigation of the structure using 11B magic angle spinning (MAS) nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy"

[6] "The BS-1 catalyst retained this ability after the equivalent treatment (Fig. 1C). Further evaluation of the durability of the BS-1 catalyst was performed in a continuous ODHP test with high propane conversion (32.9 to 43.7%) that might produce 10 vol% water in the gas."

[7] "The zeolite structure was maintained and boron leaching was almost negligible in the reaction for 208 hours, as confirmed by the ICP analysis, N2 sorption, XRD pattern, SEM images, and TEM images of the used catalyst"

[8] "The BS-1 catalyst was synthesized from a solvent-free crystallization strategy in the presence of tetrapropylammonium (TPA+) hydroxide from a synthesis gel at 180C for 3 days."

[1] "The B-based materials with 3-D dispersed active sites generally exhibit porous structures and high specific surface areas."

[2] "The high specific surface area and suitable pore volume provide abundant sites to accommodate the active B species and confined space that influences the reaction behavior of radicals."

[3] "Loading the B active components on the surface of the 3-D porous structure or doping them into the 3-D framework of the porous materials constitutes an effective method to construct 3-D B active sites."

[4] "By doping B species into zeolite frameworks, a 3-D dispersion of the B active site can be achieved."

[5] "The loading of B active species in the 3-D porous materials or doping into the zeolite frameworks not only provides a higher utility of B active sites but also constructs confined space which regulates the reaction behaviors of active radical intermediates and mass transport behaviors"

[6] "The introduction of confined walls is able to directly increase the wall termination possibility of the gas-phase radicals, which exhibits a negative effect on the reaction rate."

[7] "As the confinement also influences the diffusion of reactants, radical intermediates, and products, predicting the net effect of the 3-D dispersion of active sites on the apparent catalytic performances is difficult."

[8] "The 3-D pore structure of zeolite played an important role in the conversion of propane, which could affect the mass and heat transport."

[9] "The suitable 3-D pore structures render ordered macroporous boron phosphate a very promising catalyst for propane oxidative dehydrogenation, and it is expected to meet the industrial standard."

[1] "Zeolites are one of the most common catalyst supports, and widely used in industry due to its large internal surface areas, micropores of molecular dimension, and high thermal stabilities"

[2] "Layered borosilicate zeolites were synthesized."

[3] "The presence of boron in the framework was confirmed by the FT-IR spectra"

[4] "The bands at 1405 and 926 cm1 were assigned to trigonally and tetrahedrally coordinated boron respectively"

[5] "11B MAS NMR spectra of as-prepared BZEO-2 and after different reaction intervals were measured"

[6] "At least five types of major B species (B[3]a, B[3]b, B[3]c, B[4]a and B[4]b) present in the catalysts."

[7] "The peaks at 18, 15 and 11 ppm were ascribed to tri-coordinated boron which denoted as B[3]a, B[3]b and B[3]c respectively."

[8] "Sites B[3]b and B[3]c were assigned to framework B(OSi)xOH3-x(x=1,2) and B(OSi)3 structure"

[9] "The sharp peaks at around 0 ppm and 2.8 ppm were accordingly assigned to B(OH)2(OSi)2 and B(OSi)4 tetrahedral framework, donated as B[4]a and B[4]b"

[10] "We postulate that B[3]a and B[3]b are responsible for the ODH activity."

[11] "The N2 adsorption-desorption isotherms of different boron-containing MWW-typed zeolites exhibited nearly type-I shape (Fig. 2b), featuring predominantly micropores with a small proportion of interstitial mesopores."

[12] "As seen in Fig. 2a, the X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns showed four main diffraction peaks at 2θ = 7.21, 8.02, 10.10 and 26.33, corresponding to the known (1 0 0), (1 0 1), (1 0 2) and (3 1 0) reflections of ERB-1, which confirmed the MWW structure"

[1] "BN@BPO4 self-supporting monolithic foam with oriented bowl-like structure was obtained, which is built by numerous oriented bowl-like blocks and shows a double layer structure with face-to-face opening."

[2] "Further, pure h-BN monolithic foam with oriented bowl-like structure prepared at higher temperature possessed multimodal hierarchically porous structure and excellent performance in the catalytic oxidative dehydrogenation of propane into propene and the removal of organic pollutants."

[3] "Bowl-like structures have great potential in the field of catalysis, environmental remediation, energy storage, etc., because of the large surface area, porous structure, and buffer hollow space."

[4] "We believe the as-generated h-BN can enhance the gas trapping capacity of liquid B2O3 environment foam to precisely control pressure differential between large and small bubbles and thus favors the oriented opening of bowl-like structure."

"Carbon nanofibres (CNFs) were modified with B and P by an exsitu approach. In addition, CNFs doped with N were prepared insitu using ethylenediamine as the N and C source."

"B-CNFs with different B loadings were prepared by the incipient wetness impregnation of aqueous boric acid solutions. Subsequently, the B-CNFs were calcined at 773K as the standard temperature in N2 atmosphere."

"Both the surface area and pore volume (Table1) increase after doping with only minor amounts of B (0.5wt% B). Further B doping diminishes the surface area and pore volume slightly, but the values are still larger than those for pristine CNFs."

"This suggests that boron does not plug the pores of the original CNFs, but instead covers the pore walls. The increased surface area and pore volume could be explained tentatively by the etching of some amorphous carbon during calcination at 773K in the presence of boric acid."

"The thermal stability increases by approximately 80K after only 0.5wt% B is deposited. The increase in thermal resistance is only marginal for further B loading."

"As the calcination temperature increases, the peak widens to higher BEs if the material is calcined above 973K and additionally widens to lower BEs if the material is calcined at a higher temperature of 1173K. This suggests that new B species develop as the calcination temperature increases."

"Pristine CNFs and CNFs with different B loadings were characterised texturally by N2 physisorption. All the isotherms are of Type IV with hysteresis loops at high relative pressures indicative of mesoporous materials."

"The samples exhibit a broad pore size distribution with a peak maximum at 58nm for pristine CNFs and at 80nm for CNFs after B doping (FigureS2)."

"Based on XPS assignments in the literature, after deconvolution of the spectra shown in Figure2, the peaks can be attributed to several B species summarised in Table2 and represented schematically in FigureS4."

"A peak at BE=192.7eV (B1), which is the predominant peak in B-CNF calcined at 673 and 773K, can be attributed to B linked to three O atoms isolated or a (BO3)n chain bonded to the zig-zag face of the graphite lattice (FigureS4a)."

[1] "Boron-based metal-free catalysts for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) have drawn great attention in both academia and industry due to their impressive activity and olefin selectivity."

[2] "SiO2 obtained by TEOS hydrolysis acts as a media layer to bridge the cordierite substrate and boron oxide via abundant SiOH groups."

[3] "The well-developed straight channels of honeycomb cordierite make it possible to carry out the reactor under high gas hourly space velocity (GHSV) and the thin wash-coated B2O3 layer can effectively facilitate the pore diffusion on the catalyst."

[4] "The prepared B2O3/SiO2@HC monolithic catalyst exhibits good catalytic performance at low boron oxide loading and achieves excellent propylene selectivity (86.0%), olefin selectivity (97.6%, propylene and ethylene) and negligible CO2 (0.1%) at 16.9% propane conversion under high GHSV of 345,600ml·(g B2O3)1·h1"

[5] "To solve this problem, the cordierite support was modified by an additional silica coating layer which can attach firmly on the cordierite substrate possibly by forming SiOAl, SiOMg, SiOSi bonds, and attach to the boron oxide layer via SiOB bonds."

[1] "It is demonstrated that the chromium catalysts supported on MCF exhibit much higher catalytic activity in terms of propane conversion and propylene yield than literature results obtained over chromium-supported mesoporous SBA-15 or MCM-41 catalysts during the ODH of propane."

          [2] "Enhanced catalytic performance of the chromium-containing mesoporous MCF catalysts has been attributed to the unique three-dimensional (3D), continuous, ultralarge mesopore structure of the MCF materials, which allow a much faster internal molecular transport during the ODH of propane."

          [3] "A series of chromium-containing mesocellular silica foam (MCF) catalysts have been prepared and characterized in the oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of propane between 350 and 600 C."

[1] "Silicon boride (SiB3-6), a metal-free material enriching in boron sites, exhibits good oxidation resistance property at high temperature and could be as a potential catalyst for ODH of light alkanes."

[2] "The stability was evidenced by the operation of a 100-h test with steady conversion and product selectivity."

[3] "The difference of selectivity between silicon boride with other boron-containing catalysts maybe resulted from the different subsurface structure"

[4] "To further identify the active sites, the structure evolution of the silicon boride catalyst before and after activation was characterized by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis."

[5] "Upon exposure to the ODH of propane reaction (535C), the surface oxygen concentrations increased to 50.4% after 1h (SiB-1h) and 54.8% after 3h (SiB-3h)"

[6] "The functionalised silicon boride showed high ODH activity for light alkanes; more importantly, the antioxidant ability of silicon boride ensured the catalytic stability."

[7] "To better understand the activation and reaction process, XRD measurement was performed to trace the structure evolution of the silicon boride catalyst under different conditions, including heated to 535C, activated in oxygen or reaction atmosphere and then cooled to room temperature"

[8] "After being subjected to ODH reaction, the catalyst retained the bulk structure of silicon boride (Fig. S1), suggesting that the oxyfunctionalization may only occur on the surface of catalyst."

[9] "Furthermore, a higher binding energy of the B 1s signal located at 193.8eV was detected for SiB-1h and SiB-3h catalysts, which was assigned to the boron oxide (B2O3, Fig. 2 b)."

[1] "Boron nitride was first impregnated with 1m sodium nitrite aqueous solution, followed by steam (5vol.% H2O/N2) activation at 530C for 3h; the resulting sample (BNOH) was washed with aqueous ammonia and finally calcined at 500C for 2h in air."

[2] "The BNOH catalyst inherited a hexagonal layered structure of boron nitride (FigureS3). Aberration-corrected transmission electron microscopy (TEM) analyses identified the in-plane lattice retained its hexagonal symmetry with a large number of edges that were newly created during steam activation"

[3] "X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis identified that the surface concentrations of boron and oxygen were 44.3% and 9.2% (Figure2c), respectively. There were two types of boron species (Figure2c); one was coordinated with nitrogen on the flat surface whereas the other was bonded to oxygen at the edge."

[4] "There were two types of boronoxygen bonding at 26.0 and 24.4ppm; the former represents the edge boron sites bonded to two bridging oxygen atoms, and the latter corresponded to BOH bonding, which was identified by the sharp 1H resonance at 1.2ppm in the 1H MAS NMR spectrum"

[5] "The BOH groups at the edges of boron nitride selectively activate the CH bond in propane and simultaneously suppress the overoxidation of propylene into CO2."

"One-dimensional nanomaterials have attracted considerable attention for applications in catalysis because of their conducive to the transmission of substances and the potential for highly active site exposure."

"The chemical and physical properties of nanofibers prepared by the electrospinning method can be easily adjusted by changing conditions in the electrospinning process."

"Meanwhile, there is good interaction between the nanoparticles and the support in the nanocatalyst prepared by the electrospinning method to further ensure their activity, selectivity, and long-term stability."

"The TEM and STEM-EDX mapping images of the h-BN/SiO2 nanofiber catalyst (Figure2fh) showed that the h-BN was uniformly dispersed on the dense SiO2 support."

"The higher activity for the h-BN/SiO2 nanofiber catalyst was mainly because that the one-dimensional structure facilitated active site exposure, participating in the catalysis and achieving a higher conversion."

"Fibrous nanomaterials have drawn considerable attention in the field of catalysis due to the promoted utilization of the surface and facilitated mass transfer process."

"The key is to prepare uniform sols consisting of exfoliated h-BN. The diameters of the nanofiber catalysts can be tuned in the range of 150300nm through h-BN loading change."

"The obtained h-BN/SiO2 nanofiber exhibited a macroscopical film and fibrous microstructure (Figure1b). Besides, some knots were observed in the nanofiber structure, indicating that a few large sizes of particles were involved in the prepared nanofiber, consistent with SEM images of exfoliated h-BN."

[1] "Energy-filtered transmission electron microscopy (EF-TEM) shows that both boron and oxygen are highly dispersed throughout the CNT substrate"

[2] "The composite is stable under reaction conditions, and all of the B2O3 (1.7atom% B for 5B-oCNT) could be detected by electron energy-loss spectroscopy (EELS) after use in ODH"

[3] "Owing to the chosen preparation method, the majority of amorphous B2O3 is deposited in the cavity and on the tips of CNTs. Only a minor fraction of the outer CNT surface is covered by an amorphous coating of about 12nm thickness, whereas a highly dispersed sub-monolayer deposition of BOx species is expected to be omnipresent"

[4] "The good thermal stability of the doped samples during TPO indicates a covalent bonding to the CNT structure, whereas the B2O3/P2O5 filling of the CNTs acts as a backbone against oxidation."

[5] "Apart from the suppressed total combustion reaction on the modified CNTs, a further reason for enhanced propene selectivity may also be the lower reoxidation capacity of active sites. Boron oxide as an electron-deficient promoter tends to inhibit the dissociative adsorption of O2 and thus sustains the selective oxygen species on the catalyst surface."

[6] "B- and P-modified samples were prepared by incipient wetness impregnation of oCNTs (6mLg1) using aqueous solutions of (NH4)2B10O168H2O and (NH4)2HPO4 (Sigma Aldrich, >99%), to achieve loadings of between x=0.003 and 5wt% B2O3 or 5wt% P2O5."

[7] "B2O3-modified CNTs deactivate to a small extent initially, which may be due to the decomposition or thermal spreading of the deposited B2O3 precursor."

[1] "Compared with crystalline zeolite with microporous structure and saturated coordination framework atoms, embryonic zeolitic materials have the feature of extra-large microporosity with several unit cell dimensions of size."

[2] "The greatly exposed small unit cells allow guest molecules easy to diffuse and the extra-large micropores improve the efficiency of mass transfer and accessibility of the active sites."

[3] "More importantly, after embedding boron atoms, the defect-rich zeolitic structures offer abundant SiOH and BOH groups, which contributed to the stabilization of boron species and construction of active boron centers with proton transfer with adjacent SiOH through hydrogen bonds."

[4] "Boron-containing zeolites have been proven potential in catalyzing the oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) process and the boron sites in open coordination are considered as the active center."

[5] "Solid-state NMR reveals the formation of boron sites in open coordination derived from the defect-rich structure of embryonic borosilicate zeolite, guaranteeing ample exposure of the active center."

[6] "The silanol-rich structure was shown to disperse boron species and limit their detachment from the catalytic system through the redispersion of over-hydrolyzed boron species."

[7] "Structure characterizations and kinetic measurements revealed that the H-bonded BOH groups in defect tri-coordination boron species were responsible for activating propane on the catalysts surface and gas phase, and the reactions in the gas phase were mainly responsible for the high performance in ODHP reaction."

[1] "Electrospinning was employed for the synthesis of one-dimensional porous boron-doped silica nanofiber (PBSN) catalysts in one step."

[2] "The TEM image of PBSN-3 (Fig. 1(c)) shows a porous structure associated with a homogeneous distribution of Si, B, and O elements in the entire catalyst"

[3] "The N2 physical sorption isotherms of the PBSN catalysts (Fig. 2(a)) showed a type-IV shape, indicating their accessible mesoporous characteristics."

[4] "The 11B NMR analysis showed that the tri- and tetra-coordinated boron species were immobilized on the catalysts via BOSi bridges, which is consistent with the FTIR results."

[5] "B2O3 signals were not observed, suggesting that the B2O3 species may be highly dispersed in the fiber structure, together with the results of STEM-EDX mapping."

[6] "The one-dimensional nanofibers with open pore structures not only prevented diffusion limitation but also guaranteed high catalytic activity at high weight hourly space velocity (WHSV) in the ODH of alkanes."

[7] "Compared to other supported boron oxide catalysts, PBSN catalysts showed higher olefin selectivity and stability."

[1] "Here, we present both hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) and boron nitride nanotubes (BNNTs) as metal-free materials able to catalyze the ODHP reaction."

[2] "BNNTs exhibit a rate of propane consumption (mol C3H8 kg-cat1 s1) more than one order of magnitude as high as that observed with h-BN (fig. S4). The higher activity of BNNTs at least partially reflects the higher surface area of BNNTs relative to h-BN (BNNT, 97  5 m2 g1 versus h-BN, 16  1 m2 g1)"

[3] "From the combination of catalytic activity, spectroscopic data, and DFT calculations and in line with the observed oxygen-dependence of the kinetics, we therefore propose that an oxygen molecule bonded to one B and one N [an oxygen-terminated armchair edge of BN (>BOON<)] acts as active site for the ODHP reaction."

[4] "We consider that the observed high olefin selectivity may largely be due to the stabilization of the propyl radical by the nitroxyl radical site. Indeed, the one-dimensional (1D) nature of this edge avoids the creation of a highly reactive propyl radical (typical of 0D single-site catalysts) (34), and also the overoxidation of the adsorbed species (typical of 2D surface catalysts) is suppressed (35)."

"B2O3@BPO4 sandwich-like hollow spheres were synthesized via a one-step template-free method."

"At reaction temperatures (>450 C), melted B2O3 supported on the surface of BPO4 hollow spheres acts as a catalytically active species for the selective oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propene, with an excellent productivity of 0.79 gC3H6 gcat1 h1 and a high stability at 550 C."

"Herein, we present a B2O3@BPO4 composite with a sandwich-like hollow sphere structure produced using a one-step template-free method without any postprocessing. The sandwich-like B2O3 composite consists of BPO4 hollow spheres covered with B2O3 nanowires at room temperature."

"For traditional supported catalysts, to gain more active sites, hollow micro-/nanostructured materials with low density, large surface area, and high loading capacity are often used as supports"

"Commonly, the maximum utilization of the two sides of planar supports is allowed by sandwich-like structures, but sandwich-like structures are rarely used in hollow-sphere structures due to the difficulty of capsulation at micro-/nanoscale."

"During the cooling process, liquid B2O3 cools down and solidifies into nanowires covering both the inside and outside of the BPO4 hollow sphere, forming sandwich-type B2O3@BPO4 hollow spheres."

"Solid-state NMR spectroscopy of hydrothermally synthesized B-MWW reveals that boron is fully incorporated into the zeolite framework as trivalent BO3 units. These isolated sites are inactive for oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of propane, which refutes the hypothesis that site-isolated boron species are the active site on boron-containing ODH catalysts."

"Using 11B solid-state NMR spectroscopy, we show that the majority of boron species in B-MWW exist as isolated BO3 units, fully incorporated into the zeolite framework. However, this material shows no catalytic activity for ODH of propane to propene."

"B-MWW was hydrothermally synthesized according to an established literature procedure"

"Based upon the analytical simulations, B(OSi)3 units make up ca. 90% of the boron incorporated into the framework. The peak with δiso(11B) = 15 ppm and ca. 10% integrated intensity is assigned to a B(OSi)2(OH) species consisting of two bonds to the framework and a terminal hydroxide."

"In summary, the 11B chemical shifts suggest that in B-MWW nearly all boron atoms are incorporated into the framework. The SSNMR data also suggests that these sites are well separated (>34Å apart) from one another, for the reasons given below."

"All of these observations confirm the hypothesis that catalytically inactive B-MWW consist of predominately isolated boron sites incorporated into the zeolite framework, while the active ODH catalyst B/B-MWW contains some partially aggregated boron sites."

"The difference in boron sites in B-MWW and these other boron materials leads us to the important conclusion that the boron-catalyzed ODH of propane does not proceed over an isolated BO3 site. Rather, active boron-based ODH catalysts likely requires boron species with some degree of B-O-B connectivity."

"Boron oxide embedded in zeolites Zeolites are crystalline aluminosilicate materials with three-dimensional network containing channels and cavities of molecular dimensions, and the presence of Al in tetrahedra makes the framework negatively charged."

"Recently, layered borosilicate zeolite (ERB-1, MWW structure) with defective trigonal boron species was reported as a highly active and selective catalyst for the ODH of propane to take advantage of their specific morphology inherent with large internal surface areas, micropore structure and high thermal stability."

"In these synthesized zeolites, the boron species were classified into five types according to solid-state 11B MAS NMR, i.e. framework trigonal B(OSi)xOH3x(x=1,2), B(OSi)3, tetrahedral B(OH)2(OSi)2, B(OSi)4 and aggregated terminal BOH species"

"Isomorphous substitution of tri- or tetravalent metal atoms (Al, Ti, Fe and V) by borosilicate zeolites is a good route in the production of some new zeolites that need expensive organic structure directing agents (OSDAs), long crystallization time or co-presence of dopant."

"Furthermore, taking advantage of the high propensity of boron to hydrolyze, its presence benefits the fabrication of mesoporous zeolite, and may increase the mesopore volume by 46%."

"Lu and coworkers synthesized mesoporous silica-supported boron oxide catalysts (B2O3/SBA-15) and identified four B species by using the 11B NMR technique"

"In order to improve the exposure of active sites and the mass transfer, a three-dimensional ordered macroporous BPO4 material was developed with a robust framework, which exhibited excellent activity and selectivity in the ODH of propane"

"A B2O3@BPO4 sandwich-like hollow sphere was reported as a liquid-phase catalyst in ODH of propane, and remained stable for 27 h at 550 C with a C3H6 productivity of 0.79 gC3H6 gcat1 h1"

"The preparation of a boron nitride wash-coated monolithic catalyst49 offered an applicable way to improve, besides the olefin selectivity, the heat and mass transfer which is vital for industrialization owing to the intrinsic feature of high exothermicity of the ODH reaction that could produce hotspots and thus subsequent negative consequences in the olefin selectivity and safety issues."

"By means of similar strategies, functionalized silicon boride, supported B2O3 on high surface area SBA-15, and ordered macroporous boron phosphate were also reported with remarkable performance in the ODH of light alkanes."

"For h-BN, the edge-hydroxylation of BN, synthesis of BN with boric acid and dicyanamide, and assembly of 2D BN nanosheets into 3D ordered architectures were reported as effective ways to enhance the catalytic activity of BN."

"When using dicyanamide to substitute for urea in the preparation for high surface area boron nitride, its enhanced catalytic performance was maintained in the ODH of propane in view of the 53% propylene selectivity and 18% ethylene selectivity at a 52% propane conversion."

"Recently, the discovery that hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) selectively oxidized propane to propylene with only negligible CO2 formation broke through the restriction of this process."

"Rational etching and chemical modifications on the surface of catalysts are critical for improving activity and understanding the reaction mechanism."

"High energy species (radicals, ions, and electrons) in plasma are capable of modifying surface property and composition of catalytic materials through breaking surface chemical bonds and reacting with surface atoms to form new chemical bonds."

"N2-BN exhibited a remarkable ODH reaction performance (26.0% propane conversion and 89.4% olefins selectivity)"

"The enhanced reactivity was closely related to the increased N-defects."

"Two types of N-defects (TBC and OBC) were generated during plasma treatment while TBC possibly preferred to become active BOx species under the ODH atmosphere and further converted propane to propylene."

"Spectroscopy demonstrated that three-boron center N-defects in the catalyst played a pivotal role in facilitating the conversion of propane."

"As an efficient up-to-down synthesis method, plasma technology not only provides a feasible way for the design of functionalized or defects-rich catalysts but also deepens the comprehension of active sites."

[1] "Ordered macroporous materials have an extremely favorable architecture, which can improve mass transport, reduce diffusion limitations, and expose a large number of active sites"

[2] "The ordered macroporous structure was an inverse replica of the template, with an average diameter of 200 nm for the interconnected macropores"

[3] "BPO4(OM) possessed abundant and fully interconnected macropores with a large volume."

[4] "The interconnected and open macropores of BPO4 are beneficial to the mass transfer to allow the active sites easily accessible and lead to better catalytic efficiency under high space velocity conditions"

[5] "The tri-coordinated surface boron species were identified as the active catalytic sites for the ODH of propane."

[6] "The content of tri-coordinated surface boron species increased from ca. 41% in fresh BPO4(OM) to 51% in the spent catalyst"

[7] "The interconnected macropores of the BPO4(OM) sample were formed through the inverse templating effect of the polybenzoxazine polymer spheres, consisting of a matrix of macropores bridged by ink-bottle neck-like channels of 80 nm in diameter."

[8] "The presence of the excess electron density in its vicinity is expected to perturb the binding strength of 1s electron and shift the bind energy to a lower value. The tetra-coordinated boron species represented the transition region to extend the bulk structure to the surface."

[9] "The tri-coordinated B site has less electron density in its vicinity than the tetra-coordinated B site since in these species B always remained with a former oxidation state of +3, which was neutralized when being tri-coordinated while felt excess negative charge when tetra-coordinated."

"Hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) is a burgeoning catalyst for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) with impressive light olefins selectivity, which deserves further study to optimize the heat and mass transfer process with the aim of promoting the potential industrial application since ODHP is a highly exothermic process."

"The typical structure of h-BN/Cordierite with well-developed straight-channel and short diffusive pathway of the thin wash-coated h-BN layer guarantee the mass transfer process at high GHSV, achieving a high propylene space time yield of 18.6 gC3H6 gBN−1h−1 and improving the selectivity towards propylene and ethylene by suppressing secondary reactions of deep oxidation."

"The well-developed straight-channel structure of h-BN/Cordierite provides space for gas phase radical reactions, thus, propane conversion over h-BN/Cordierite is higher than that over h-BN powder."

"h-BN wash-coated cordierite monolithic catalyst was designed through a chemical vapor deposition method using boron acid and urea as precursors"

"Considering that the cordierite was composed of Al2O3, MgO and SiO2, hydroxyl groups will present on the surface of cordierite. The hydrogen bonds interaction can be formed between the surface OH of cordierite and BOH groups of H3BO3. In addition, CVD process could strength the interaction of boron species with cordierite in the form of BOSi and BOAl, which contributes to the outstanding adhesiveness between h-BN layer and cordierite."

[1] "Boron-based catalysts exhibit high alkene selectivity in ODHP, but the understanding of catalytic mechanism remains incomplete, especially regarding the observed supra-linear reaction order of alkanes."

[2] "We studied the impact of spatial confinement on the performance and kinetics of boron oxide supported on silica with different pore structures."

[3] "The formation rate of propylene decreases with the degree of confinement of active boron sites derived from the support."

[4] "The apparent activation energy increases with the ODHP activity, and exhibits a positive correlation with the apparent propane reaction order."

[5] "The apparent propane order of B2O3/SiO2 varies from 1 to 3, which is impacted by pore structure of supports, loading of B2O3, and partial pressure of propane."
