B-based materials with 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks, such as borosilicate zeolites, exhibit several structural characteristics that enhance catalytic performance:

1. Open coordination: Boron species are anchored to the zeolite matrix in an open coordination form, allowing for better accessibility of reactants to the active sites.

2. Hydrogen bonding: The presence of ample SiOH groups on the surface facilitates the formation of hydrogen bonds with BOH in defective boron species. This interaction not only stabilizes the boron species but also creates active centers for catalysis.

3. Dynamic transformation: During the catalytic process, isolated boron species can dynamically transform into aggregated ones, which is associated with increased catalytic activity.

4. Defect-rich structure: Incompletely crystallized zeolites with low crystallinity exhibit superior catalytic activity and higher olefin productivity at low temperatures. This is attributed to the enrichment of defect boron sites in these structures.

5. Uniform dispersion: Boron species are uniformly anchored to the hydroxyl-rich MFI-type zeolite matrix, ensuring a homogeneous distribution of active sites throughout the catalyst.

6. Oligomeric form: The boron species exist in an oligomeric form, which contributes to the construction of highly active boron centers.

These structural features enhance catalytic performance by:

1. Increasing the accessibility and number of active sites
2. Stabilizing the boron species and preventing excessive leaching
3. Allowing for dynamic optimization of catalytic activity during the reaction
4. Creating a high concentration of defect sites that are crucial for certain reactions
5. Ensuring a uniform distribution of active sites for consistent catalytic performance

Methods used to incorporate B active components into these structures include:

1. Hydrothermal synthesis: The crystallinity of the zeolite is regulated by adjusting hydrothermal synthesis conditions, allowing for control over the formation of defect boron sites.

2. Incomplete crystallization: This method is particularly effective in creating catalysts with low crystallinity and enriched defect boron sites, which exhibit superior activity in reactions like ODHP.

3. Post-synthesis modification: Although not explicitly mentioned in the given text, this method is often used to introduce or modify boron species in zeolite frameworks.

The effectiveness of these methods varies depending on the specific catalytic application. For oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP), the incomplete crystallization method proves to be highly effective, as it results in a catalyst with high olefin productivity at low reaction temperatures and high weight-hour-space-velocity. The hydrothermal synthesis method allows for control over the crystallinity and distribution of boron species, which is crucial for tailoring the catalyst's properties for specific applications.

In conclusion, the incorporation of B active components into 3-D porous frameworks through methods that promote open coordination, hydrogen bonding, and the formation of defect sites appears to be highly effective for enhancing catalytic performance, particularly in low-temperature oxidative dehydrogenation reactions.

The structural characteristics of B-based materials with 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks include:

3. Microporous structure: The MFI zeolite structure provides a confined environment that may contribute to enhanced catalytic activity.

4. Stability: The zeolite framework maintains its structure during long-term catalytic use, with minimal boron leaching.

These features enhance catalytic performance by:

1. Efficient activation: The isolated boron structure efficiently activates molecular oxygen and propane, promoting dehydrogenation reactions.

2. Hydrolysis resistance: The framework hinders full boron hydrolysis during catalysis, contributing to improved durability and water tolerance.

3. High durability: The catalyst retains its structure and performance over extended periods (208 hours) with minimal boron leaching.

The method used to incorporate B active components into these structures involves a solvent-free crystallization strategy using tetrapropylammonium hydroxide at 180Â°C for 3 days. This approach appears to be effective for creating isolated boron sites within the zeolite structure, which is crucial for the catalyst's performance in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP).

This synthesis method's effectiveness lies in its ability to create well-dispersed, isolated boron sites that resist agglomeration and maintain stability under reaction conditions. For ODHP applications, this approach shows significant promise due to the resulting catalyst's high activity, selectivity, and durability.

However, the effectiveness of this method for other catalytic applications would depend on the specific reaction requirements and desired catalyst properties. Further research would be needed to determine its suitability for different catalytic processes and to compare it with alternative methods of incorporating boron into porous frameworks.

The hydrothermal synthesis method appears to be effective for creating borosilicate zeolites with well-dispersed boron species. It allows for the incorporation of boron into the zeolite framework and the creation of various boron coordination environments, including the defective trigonal structures (B[3]a and B[3]b) that are postulated to be responsible for ODH activity.

The effectiveness of this method for different catalytic applications depends on the specific reaction requirements. For ODH reactions, the creation of defective trigonal boron structures appears to be particularly beneficial. However, the relative effectiveness for other catalytic applications would require further investigation and comparison with alternative synthesis methods.

Further research is needed to optimize boron incorporation methods for specific catalytic applications and to better understand the relationship between boron coordination environment and catalytic performance in various reactions.

The structural characteristics of B-based materials with 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks include:

1. Oriented bowl-like structure: The materials are composed of numerous oriented bowl-like blocks arranged in a double layer structure with face-to-face openings.

2. Multimodal hierarchically porous structure: This feature is present in pure h-BN monolithic foam prepared at higher temperatures.

3. Large surface area: The bowl-like structures provide a large surface area for catalytic reactions.

4. Porous structure: The materials exhibit a porous nature, enhancing mass transfer and accessibility of active sites.

5. Buffer hollow space: The bowl-like structures create buffer hollow spaces, which can be advantageous for certain catalytic processes.

These structural features enhance catalytic performance by:
- Increasing the number of accessible active sites
- Improving mass transfer of reactants and products
- Facilitating better interaction between reactants and catalysts
- Potentially trapping and concentrating reactants in buffer hollow spaces

The method used to incorporate B active components into these structures involves a self-assembly strategy at the gas/liquid interface of liquid B2O3 environment foam. This approach allows for:
- Control over the opening direction of bowl-like structures
- Adjustment of opening size by changing the amount of Cu(NO3)2 additives
- Enhancement of gas trapping capacity, which helps control pressure differentials between bubbles and favors the oriented opening of bowl-like structures

The effectiveness of this method is demonstrated by the excellent performance of the resulting materials in:
- Catalytic oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propene
- Removal of organic pollutants

However, the literature does not provide a comprehensive comparison of this method with other approaches for incorporating B active components into porous frameworks. Therefore, it is difficult to critically evaluate its relative effectiveness for different catalytic applications beyond the specific examples mentioned.

The structural characteristics of B-based materials with dispersed active sites in porous frameworks, as described in the literature, include:

1. Mesoporous structure: The materials show Type IV isotherms with hysteresis loops, indicating a mesoporous nature.

2. Increased surface area and pore volume: Doping with small amounts of B (0.5 wt%) increases both surface area and pore volume.

3. Broad pore size distribution: The pore sizes range from 58 nm for pristine CNFs to 80 nm for B-doped CNFs.

4. Boron distribution: B covers the pore walls without plugging the pores, maintaining the porous structure while introducing active sites.

5. Multiple B species: XPS analysis reveals different B species present in the structure, including B linked to three O atoms and (BO3)n chains bonded to the graphite lattice.

6. Enhanced thermal stability: B doping increases thermal stability by approximately 80K with 0.5 wt% B.

These structural features enhance catalytic performance by:

1. Providing more accessible active sites due to increased surface area and pore volume.
2. Maintaining pore structure and accessibility for efficient mass transfer.
3. Improving catalyst stability at higher temperatures.
4. Offering diverse B species as potential active sites for catalysis.

The main method used to incorporate B active components is incipient wetness impregnation of aqueous boric acid solutions, followed by calcination at 773K in N2 atmosphere. This method appears effective for creating well-dispersed B sites without compromising the porous structure of the CNFs.

The effectiveness of this method for different catalytic applications is not comprehensively evaluated in the given literature. For the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane, B-doped CNFs showed improved selectivity to propene compared to pristine CNFs, indicating effectiveness for this particular application. However, a critical evaluation across different reactions and comparison with other incorporation methods is not possible based solely on this information.

The structural characteristics of B-based materials with 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks, as described in the literature, primarily focus on a honeycomb cordierite monolithic catalyst coated with SiO2 and B2O3. These structural features enhance catalytic performance in several ways:

1. Improved dispersion: The honeycomb cordierite structure provides a high surface area for dispersing the active B2O3 component, leading to better accessibility of active sites.

2. Enhanced mass transfer: The well-developed straight channels of the honeycomb structure facilitate high gas hourly space velocity (GHSV) and improve pore diffusion, resulting in better reactant-catalyst contact.

3. Stability: The SiO2 coating acts as a bridging layer between the cordierite substrate and B2O3, improving the attachment and stability of the active component. It forms SiO-Al, SiO-Mg, SiO-Si bonds with the substrate and SiO-B bonds with the boron oxide layer.

4. Thin active layer: The thin wash-coated B2O3 layer effectively facilitates pore diffusion on the catalyst surface.

The method used to incorporate B active components into these structures involves a two-step coating process:

1. First, SiO2 is coated onto the cordierite support using TEOS hydrolysis. This creates a media layer with abundant SiOH groups.
2. Then, B2O3 is coated onto the SiO2 layer using a boric acid solution.

This method proves effective for ODHP catalysis, as evidenced by the high propylene selectivity (86.0%), olefin selectivity (97.6%), and low CO2 production (0.1%) under high GHSV conditions (345,600 mlÂ·(g B2O3)^-1Â·h^-1). The catalyst shows good performance even at low boron oxide loading.

While this method is highly effective for ODHP, its relative effectiveness for other catalytic applications is not explicitly discussed in the given literature. However, the principles of using a porous support structure and a mediating layer to disperse and stabilize active sites could potentially be applied to other catalytic systems, although further research would be needed to confirm this.

While the provided literature does not specifically discuss B-based materials, it offers insights into the structural characteristics of 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks, using chromium-containing mesocellular silica foam (MCF) catalysts as an example. The key structural features enhancing catalytic performance include:

          1. Three-dimensional (3D) structure
          2. Continuous framework
          3. Ultralarge mesopore structure

          These characteristics allow for faster internal molecular transport during catalytic reactions, leading to higher catalytic activity. The MCF-supported chromium catalysts demonstrated superior performance in propane conversion and propylene yield compared to other mesoporous supports like SBA-15 or MCM-41.

          Regarding the incorporation of active components, the literature mentions the preparation of chromium-containing MCF catalysts but does not provide specific details on the methods used. The effectiveness of this incorporation is evidenced by the enhanced catalytic performance in the oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of propane.

          While the study focuses on chromium catalysts for propane ODH, the principles of using 3-D porous frameworks with dispersed active sites to enhance catalytic performance could potentially be applied to B-based materials in other catalytic applications. However, the literature does not provide specific information on B-based materials or their relative effectiveness for different catalytic applications.

The literature primarily focuses on silicon boride (SiB3-6) as a B-based catalyst for oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of light alkanes, rather than providing a comprehensive analysis of B-based materials with 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks.

   - Silicon boride is used as a starting material, and active sites are formed through activation and reaction processes.
   - Surface oxyfunctionalization occurs during the reaction, creating active boron-oxygen species.

4. Effectiveness for catalytic applications:
   - The silicon boride catalyst shows high activity and stability for ODH of light alkanes.
   - The difference in selectivity between silicon boride and other boron-containing catalysts is attributed to differences in subsurface structure, highlighting the importance of overall material structure in determining catalytic performance.

While these insights provide some understanding of B-based catalysts, the study does not offer a comprehensive analysis of 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks or compare different methods of incorporating B active components for various catalytic applications.

The literature primarily discusses edge-hydroxylated boron nitride (BNOH), which is a 2-D material rather than a 3-D porous framework. However, we can analyze its structural characteristics and how they enhance catalytic performance:

1. Structure: BNOH retains the hexagonal layered structure of boron nitride, with newly created edges during steam activation. These edges serve as the primary locations for active sites.

2. Active sites: Two types of boron-oxygen bonding exist at the edges:
   a) Edge boron sites bonded to two bridging oxygen atoms (B-O-B)
   b) Boron hydroxyl groups (B-OH)

3. Composition: XPS analysis shows the surface contains 44.3% boron and 9.2% oxygen, indicating a significant presence of oxygen-containing active sites.

4. Catalytic mechanism: The B-OH groups at the edges selectively activate C-H bonds in propane while suppressing over-oxidation of propylene to CO2, enhancing selectivity and performance.

The method used to incorporate B active components involves:
1. Impregnation with sodium nitrite solution
2. Steam activation at high temperature (530Â°C)
3. Washing with aqueous ammonia
4. Calcination in air (500Â°C)

This approach effectively creates edge-functionalized 2-D materials with active sites for oxidative dehydrogenation reactions. The steam activation step is crucial for generating the active edge sites.

While effective for this specific application (propane dehydrogenation), the literature does not discuss the method's effectiveness for other catalytic applications or compare it to other methods for creating 3-D porous frameworks with dispersed active sites.

The structural characteristics of B-based materials with 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks include:

1. One-dimensional nanofiber structure: This facilitates substance transmission, exposes more active sites, and enhances catalytic performance by improving mass transfer and increasing active site accessibility.

2. Uniform dispersion: h-BN is evenly dispersed on the SiO2 support, creating a 3-D network of active sites throughout the porous framework.

3. Tunable fiber diameters: The ability to control fiber diameter (150-300 nm) through h-BN loading allows for optimization of the catalyst structure.

4. Fibrous microstructure: The nanofiber structure provides a high surface area and allows for better mass transfer, contributing to improved catalytic efficiency.

5. Good interaction between nanoparticles and support: This ensures better activity, selectivity, and long-term stability of the catalyst.

These structural features enhance catalytic performance by:

1. Increasing active site exposure: The one-dimensional structure and uniform dispersion of h-BN maximize the number of accessible active sites.

2. Improving mass transfer: The fibrous structure facilitates the movement of reactants and products within the catalyst.

3. Enhancing stability: The strong interaction between the active component and support improves the catalyst's long-term performance.

The primary method discussed for incorporating B active components into these structures is electrospinning. This technique is effective because:

1. It allows for easy adjustment of the chemical and physical properties of the nanofibers by modifying the electrospinning conditions.

2. It enables uniform dispersion of the active component (h-BN) on the support material (SiO2).

3. It produces a one-dimensional nanostructure that enhances catalytic performance.

4. It allows for control over fiber diameter and morphology by adjusting process parameters.

The effectiveness of this method is demonstrated by the superior catalytic performance of the h-BN/SiO2 nanofiber catalyst in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reaction, showing significantly higher productivity compared to bulk h-BN and other reported boron-based catalysts.

While the study focuses primarily on ODHP, the electrospinning method for incorporating B-based active components into nanofiber structures could potentially be applied to other catalytic applications that benefit from high surface area, improved mass transfer, and well-dispersed active sites. However, further research would be needed to evaluate its effectiveness for different types of reactions and catalytic systems.

The structural characteristics of B-based materials with 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks include:

1. High dispersion of boron and oxygen throughout the carbon nanotube (CNT) substrate.
2. Stability of the B-CNT composite under reaction conditions.
3. Majority of amorphous B2O3 deposited in the cavity and on the tips of CNTs.
4. Minor fraction of the outer CNT surface covered by a thin amorphous coating (1-2 nm thickness).
5. Highly dispersed sub-monolayer deposition of BOx species omnipresent, filling surface defects and holes in graphene layers.
6. Covalent bonding of boron to the CNT structure.
7. B2O3 filling of CNTs acting as a backbone against oxidation.

These structural features enhance catalytic performance by:

1. Providing a large number of accessible active sites.
2. Improving chemical stability and resistance to oxidation.
3. Suppressing total combustion reactions on modified CNTs.
4. Inhibiting dissociative adsorption of O2, sustaining selective oxygen species on the catalyst surface.
5. Enhancing propene selectivity in oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) reactions.
6. Blocking or covering combustion sites on the surface or groups causing COx formation.

The main method used to incorporate B active components into these structures is incipient wetness impregnation using aqueous solutions of (NH4)2B10O16Â·8H2O. This method is effective for:

1. Achieving uniform dispersion of boron oxide throughout the CNT structure.
2. Allowing precise control of B2O3 loading (between 0.003 and 5 wt%).
3. Creating a highly dispersed and stable boron oxide coating on CNTs.

The effectiveness of this method for different catalytic applications can be evaluated based on:

1. Its success in enhancing propene selectivity in ODH reactions.
2. The flexibility in controlling B2O3 loading, allowing for optimization of catalytic performance.
3. The stability of the resulting catalyst under reaction conditions.

However, the method's effectiveness may be limited by:

1. Initial deactivation due to decomposition or thermal spreading of the deposited B2O3 precursor.
2. Potential non-uniform distribution of B2O3 in larger-scale applications.
3. Possible agglomeration of B2O3 particles at higher loadings.

In conclusion, while the incipient wetness impregnation method has shown promising results for incorporating boron into CNT structures for ODH reactions, further research may be needed to optimize its effectiveness for other catalytic applications and larger-scale production.

The structural characteristics of B-based materials with 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks include:

1. Extra-large microporosity: Compared to crystalline zeolites, these materials have larger pore sizes, improving mass transfer and accessibility of active sites.

2. Defect-rich structure: This feature provides abundant SiOH and BOH groups, contributing to the stabilization of boron species and the formation of active boron centers through hydrogen bonding.

3. Open coordination of boron sites: This configuration allows for better exposure of the active centers, increasing their accessibility to reactants.

4. Silanol-rich structure: This helps disperse boron species and prevents their detachment from the catalytic system.

5. H-bonded BOH groups in defect tri-coordination boron species: These are responsible for activating propane on both the catalyst surface and in the gas phase.

These structural characteristics enhance catalytic performance by:

1. Improving diffusion of guest molecules and mass transfer efficiency.
2. Increasing the accessibility and exposure of active sites.
3. Stabilizing boron species within the framework.
4. Facilitating the activation of reactants (e.g., propane in ODHP reactions).
5. Promoting gas-phase reactions, which contribute to high performance in certain catalytic processes.

The primary method used to incorporate B active components into these structures is the synthesis of embryonic borosilicate zeolites. This typically involves using tetrapropylammonium hydroxide (TPAOH) as an organic structure-directing agent and varying the B2O3:SiO2 ratio in the synthesis gel. This approach results in an amorphous, defect-rich zeolitic structure with well-dispersed boron sites.

The effectiveness of this method is demonstrated in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reactions, where embryonic borosilicate zeolite catalysts show improved olefin and propylene selectivity compared to conventional MFI-type borosilicate zeolites. However, the effectiveness for other catalytic applications may vary and requires further investigation.

While this method is effective for creating highly accessible and stable boron sites, it may have limitations in controlling the precise distribution and content of boron in the structure. Alternative methods such as post-synthesis modification might offer more control but could result in less uniform distribution of boron species.

In conclusion, the choice of incorporation method should be based on the specific requirements of the catalytic application, considering factors such as desired boron distribution, stability of active sites, and the nature of the zeolitic framework.

The structural characteristics of B-based materials with 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks include:

1. One-dimensional porous nanofiber structure
2. Homogeneous distribution of Si, B, and O elements
3. Accessible mesoporous characteristics
4. Highly dispersed B2O3 species within the fiber structure
5. Immobilization of tri- and tetra-coordinated boron species via BOSi bridges
6. Open pore structures

These features enhance catalytic performance by:

1. Preventing diffusion limitations
2. Ensuring high catalytic activity at high weight hourly space velocity (WHSV)
3. Providing higher olefin selectivity and stability compared to other supported boron oxide catalysts
4. Offering a large surface area for catalytic reactions
5. Maintaining stability of active boron species during reactions

The primary method used to incorporate B active components into these structures is electrospinning. This technique is highly effective for creating porous boron-doped silica nanofibers in a single step. It ensures:

1. Uniform dispersion and stability of boron species on the open silica nanofiber framework
2. Formation of an open nanofiber structure that enhances catalytic activity
3. Strong interaction between boron and silica through B-O-Si bonds

Electrospinning appears to be particularly effective for oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) reactions of light alkanes, as evidenced by the higher olefin selectivity and catalytic stability shown by the PBSN catalysts. This method addresses limitations of traditional supported catalysts, such as aggregation of active components and instability during reactions.

However, the effectiveness of this method for other catalytic applications would require further investigation and comparison with alternative synthesis techniques. While the structural characteristics achieved through electrospinning are generally beneficial for many heterogeneous catalytic processes, its relative effectiveness across different catalytic applications needs more comprehensive research.

The literature primarily focuses on hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) and boron nitride nanotubes (BNNTs) as catalysts for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP), rather than B-based materials with 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks. However, several structural characteristics that enhance catalytic performance can be identified:

1. Higher surface area: BNNTs have a significantly higher surface area compared to h-BN (97 Â± 5 m2/g vs. 16 Â± 1 m2/g), which contributes to their increased catalytic activity. This larger surface area provides more accessible active sites for the reaction to occur.

2. One-dimensional edge sites: The active sites are proposed to be oxygen-terminated armchair edges of BN (>BOON<). The 1D nature of these edge sites plays a crucial role in enhancing selectivity by stabilizing reaction intermediates and preventing overoxidation.

3. Metal-free composition: Both h-BN and BNNTs are metal-free materials, which offers advantages in terms of stability and selectivity compared to traditional metal-based catalysts.

The method used to incorporate B active components into these structures is not explicitly discussed in the given literature. The study focuses on the inherent properties of h-BN and BNNTs rather than on methods of incorporating additional B active components.

The effectiveness of these B-based materials for ODHP is demonstrated by their high selectivity towards propene and ethene, as well as their stability under reaction conditions. The unique structural characteristics of these materials, particularly the 1D edge sites, contribute to their superior performance compared to traditional catalysts.

While the literature does not discuss the effectiveness of these materials for other catalytic applications, the insights gained from this study could potentially be applied to develop B-based catalysts for other selective oxidation reactions. However, to fully address the question about 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks, additional research would be necessary.

The B2O3@BPO4 material exhibits a unique 3-D dispersed active site structure within a porous framework. The key structural characteristics that enhance catalytic performance include:

1. Sandwich-like hollow sphere structure: BPO4 hollow spheres serve as the support, with B2O3 nanowires covering both the inside and outside surfaces. This structure provides a large surface area, high loading capacity, and efficient utilization of both inner and outer surfaces.

2. 3-D dispersion of active sites: B2O3 nanowires cover both the inside and outside of the BPO4 hollow spheres, allowing for better dispersion and utilization of active sites.

3. High-temperature liquid phase: At reaction temperatures above 450Â°C, the B2O3 component melts, acting as a supported liquid-phase catalyst. This combines the advantages of homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysis.

4. Thermal stability: The BPO4 support stabilizes the liquid B2O3 phase at high temperatures, providing excellent stability up to 550Â°C.

5. Improved mass transfer: The hollow structure may facilitate better mass transfer during catalytic reactions.

The method used to incorporate B active components into this structure is a one-step template-free synthesis. This approach is highly effective and innovative for several reasons:

1. Simplicity: No need for templates or post-processing steps, making it more efficient than traditional methods.

2. Direct formation of the desired structure: The sandwich-like hollow spheres are formed in a single step, with B2O3 naturally covering the BPO4 hollow spheres as they cool.

3. Overcoming challenges: This method successfully creates a sandwich-like structure in hollow spheres, which has been difficult to achieve at the micro/nanoscale.

4. Versatility: The method can potentially be adapted for other similar catalyst systems.

This synthesis method is particularly effective for high-temperature catalytic applications, such as the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propene. The resulting catalyst shows excellent productivity and stability at temperatures up to 550Â°C, outperforming many metal-based catalysts.

However, the effectiveness of this method for other catalytic applications may vary depending on the specific reaction requirements, operating conditions, and the suitability of B2O3 as an active component. For reactions requiring lower temperatures or different active species, alternative synthesis methods might be more suitable.

In conclusion, the one-step template-free synthesis of B2O3@BPO4 sandwich-like hollow spheres effectively creates a 3-D dispersed active site structure that enhances catalytic performance, particularly for high-temperature applications. Future research could explore the adaptability of this method to other catalyst systems and reaction conditions.

The structural characteristics of B-based materials with 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks, such as B-MWW zeolite, include:

1. Boron is fully incorporated into the zeolite framework as trivalent BO3 units.
2. The majority (about 90%) of boron species exist as isolated B(OSi)3 units.
3. A minor portion (about 10%) exists as B(OSi)2(OH) units.
4. These boron sites are well-separated, with distances greater than 3-4 Ã between them.

However, contrary to expectations, these structural features do not enhance catalytic performance for oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of propane. In fact, the isolated boron sites in the zeolite framework are catalytically inactive for this reaction.

The method used to incorporate B active components into these structures is hydrothermal synthesis. This method is effective in creating isolated boron sites within the zeolite framework. However, the study shows that this approach is not effective for creating catalysts for propane ODH.

The effectiveness of this incorporation method was critically evaluated using advanced characterization techniques, particularly solid-state NMR spectroscopy. These techniques revealed that nearly all boron atoms were incorporated into the framework as isolated sites. However, catalytic testing showed that these isolated BO3 sites were inactive for propane ODH.

This finding challenges the assumption that isolated active sites are always beneficial for catalysis. In the case of boron-based ODH catalysts, the study suggests that some degree of B-O-B connectivity is required for catalytic activity, rather than isolated BO3 sites.

The research concludes that active boron-based ODH catalysts likely require boron species with some degree of B-O-B connectivity, rather than the isolated sites found in B-MWW. This highlights the importance of understanding the specific structural requirements for different catalytic processes when designing and synthesizing catalysts.

B-based materials with 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks exhibit several structural characteristics that enhance catalytic performance:

1. Three-dimensional network structure: Materials like zeolites and ordered macroporous structures provide a framework with channels and cavities of molecular dimensions, allowing for high surface area and controlled access to active sites.

4. Impact on catalytic behavior:
   - The apparent propane reaction order for B2O3/SiO2 varies from 1 to 3, influenced by the pore structure of supports, B2O3 loading, and propane partial pressure.
   - This variation in reaction order indicates that the structural characteristics of the support and the distribution of boron species significantly impact catalytic behavior.

The study primarily focuses on kinetic investigations rather than structural characterization. Further research would be needed to provide a comprehensive analysis of 3-D dispersed active sites and critically evaluate the methods used to incorporate B active components for different catalytic applications.

B-based materials with 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks, such as borosilicate zeolites, exhibit several structural characteristics that enhance catalytic performance:

1. Open coordination: Boron species are anchored to the zeolite matrix in an open coordination form, allowing for better accessibility of reactants to the active sites.

3. Post-synthesis modification: Although not explicitly mentioned in the given text, this method is often used to introduce or modify boron species in zeolite frameworks.

The effectiveness of these methods varies depending on the specific catalytic application. For oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP), the incomplete crystallization method proves to be highly effective, as it results in a catalyst with high olefin productivity at low reaction temperatures and high weight-hour-space-velocity.

However, the literature does not provide a comprehensive comparison of this method with other approaches for incorporating B active components into porous frameworks. Therefore, it is difficult to critically evaluate its relative effectiveness for different catalytic applications beyond the specific examples mentioned.

The structural characteristics of B-based materials with dispersed active sites in porous frameworks, as described in the literature, include:

The effectiveness of this method is demonstrated by the superior catalytic performance of the h-BN/SiO2 nanofiber catalyst in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reaction, showing significantly higher productivity compared to bulk h-BN and other reported boron-based catalysts.

While the study focuses primarily on ODHP, the electrospinning method for incorporating B-based active components into nanofiber structures could potentially be applied to other catalytic applications that benefit from high surface area, improved mass transfer, and well-dispersed active sites. However, further research would be needed to evaluate its effectiveness for different types of reactions and catalytic systems.

3. Stabilizing boron species within the framework.
4. Facilitating the activation of reactants (e.g., propane in ODHP reactions).
5. Promoting gas-phase reactions, which contribute to high performance in certain catalytic processes.

The primary method used to incorporate B active components into these structures is the synthesis of embryonic borosilicate zeolites. This typically involves using tetrapropylammonium hydroxide (TPAOH) as an organic structure-directing agent and varying the B2O3:SiO2 ratio in the synthesis gel. This approach results in an amorphous, defect-rich zeolitic structure with well-dispersed boron sites.

The effectiveness of this method is demonstrated in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reactions, where embryonic borosilicate zeolite catalysts show improved olefin and propylene selectivity compared to conventional MFI-type borosilicate zeolites. However, the effectiveness for other catalytic applications may vary and requires further investigation.

While this method is effective for creating highly accessible and stable boron sites, it may have limitations in controlling the precise distribution and content of boron in the structure. Alternative methods such as post-synthesis modification might offer more control but could result in less uniform distribution of boron species.

In conclusion, the choice of incorporation method should be based on the specific requirements of the catalytic application, considering factors such as desired boron distribution, stability of active sites, and the nature of the zeolitic framework.

The structural characteristics of B-based materials with 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks include:

1. One-dimensional porous nanofiber structure
2. Homogeneous distribution of Si, B, and O elements
3. Accessible mesoporous characteristics
4. Highly dispersed B2O3 species within the fiber structure
5. Immobilization of tri- and tetra-coordinated boron species via BOSi bridges
6. Open pore structures

These features enhance catalytic performance by:

1. Preventing diffusion limitations
2. Ensuring high catalytic activity at high weight hourly space velocity (WHSV)
3. Providing higher olefin selectivity and stability compared to other supported boron oxide catalysts
4. Offering a large surface area for catalytic reactions
5. Maintaining stability of active boron species during reactions

The primary method used to incorporate B active components into these structures is electrospinning. This technique is highly effective for creating porous boron-doped silica nanofibers in a single step. It ensures:

1. Uniform dispersion and stability of boron species on the open silica nanofiber framework
2. Formation of an open nanofiber structure that enhances catalytic activity
3. Strong interaction between boron and silica through B-O-Si bonds

Electrospinning appears to be particularly effective for oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) reactions of light alkanes, as evidenced by the higher olefin selectivity and catalytic stability shown by the PBSN catalysts. This method addresses limitations of traditional supported catalysts, such as aggregation of active components and instability during reactions.

However, the effectiveness of this method for other catalytic applications would require further investigation and comparison with alternative synthesis techniques. While the structural characteristics achieved through electrospinning are generally beneficial for many heterogeneous catalytic processes, its relative effectiveness across different catalytic applications needs more comprehensive research.

The literature primarily focuses on hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) and boron nitride nanotubes (BNNTs) as catalysts for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP), rather than B-based materials with 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks. However, several structural characteristics that enhance catalytic performance can be identified:

1. Higher surface area: BNNTs have a significantly higher surface area compared to h-BN (97 Â± 5 m2/g vs. 16 Â± 1 m2/g), which contributes to their increased catalytic activity. This larger surface area provides more accessible active sites for the reaction to occur.

2. One-dimensional edge sites: The active sites are proposed to be oxygen-terminated armchair edges of BN (>BOON<). The 1D nature of these edge sites plays a crucial role in enhancing selectivity by stabilizing reaction intermediates and preventing overoxidation.

3. Metal-free composition: Both h-BN and BNNTs are metal-free materials, which offers advantages in terms of stability and selectivity compared to traditional metal-based catalysts.

The method used to incorporate B active components into these structures is not explicitly discussed in the given literature. The study focuses on the inherent properties of h-BN and BNNTs rather than on methods of incorporating additional B active components.

The effectiveness of these B-based materials for ODHP is demonstrated by their high selectivity towards propene and ethene, as well as their stability under reaction conditions. The unique structural characteristics of these materials, particularly the 1D edge sites, contribute to their superior performance compared to traditional catalysts.

While the literature does not discuss the effectiveness of these materials for other catalytic applications, the insights gained from this study could potentially be applied to develop B-based catalysts for other selective oxidation reactions. However, to fully address the question about 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks, additional research would be necessary.

The B2O3@BPO4 material exhibits a unique 3-D dispersed active site structure within a porous framework. The key structural characteristics that enhance catalytic performance include:

1. Sandwich-like hollow sphere structure: BPO4 hollow spheres serve as the support, with B2O3 nanowires covering both the inside and outside surfaces. This structure provides a large surface area, high loading capacity, and efficient utilization of both inner and outer surfaces.

2. 3-D dispersion of active sites: B2O3 nanowires cover both the inside and outside of the BPO4 hollow spheres, allowing for better dispersion and utilization of active sites.

3. High-temperature liquid phase: At reaction temperatures above 450Â°C, the B2O3 component melts, acting as a supported liquid-phase catalyst. This combines the advantages of homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysis.

4. Thermal stability: The BPO4 support stabilizes the liquid B2O3 phase at high temperatures, providing excellent stability up to 550Â°C.

5. Improved mass transfer: The hollow structure may facilitate better mass transfer during catalytic reactions.

The method used to incorporate B active components into this structure is a one-step template-free synthesis. This approach is highly effective and innovative for several reasons:

1. Simplicity: No need for templates or post-processing steps, making it more efficient than traditional methods.

2. Direct formation of the desired structure: The sandwich-like hollow spheres are formed in a single step, with B2O3 naturally covering the BPO4 hollow spheres as they cool.

3. Overcoming challenges: This method successfully creates a sandwich-like structure in hollow spheres, which has been difficult to achieve at the micro/nanoscale.

4. Versatility: The method can potentially be adapted for other similar catalyst systems.

This synthesis method is particularly effective for high-temperature catalytic applications, such as the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propene. The resulting catalyst shows excellent productivity and stability at temperatures up to 550Â°C, outperforming many metal-based catalysts.

However, the effectiveness of this method for other catalytic applications may vary depending on the specific reaction requirements, operating conditions, and the suitability of B2O3 as an active component. For reactions requiring lower temperatures or different active species, alternative synthesis methods might be more suitable.

In conclusion, the one-step template-free synthesis of B2O3@BPO4 sandwich-like hollow spheres effectively creates a 3-D dispersed active site structure that enhances catalytic performance, particularly for high-temperature applications. Future research could explore the adaptability of this method to other catalyst systems and reaction conditions.

The structural characteristics of B-based materials with 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks, such as B-MWW zeolite, include:

1. Boron is fully incorporated into the zeolite framework as trivalent BO3 units.
2. The majority (about 90%) of boron species exist as isolated B(OSi)3 units.
3. A minor portion (about 10%) exists as B(OSi)2(OH) units.
4. These boron sites are well-separated, with distances greater than 3-4 Ã between them.

However, contrary to expectations, these structural features do not enhance catalytic performance for oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of propane. In fact, the isolated boron sites in the zeolite framework are catalytically inactive for this reaction.

The method used to incorporate B active components into these structures is hydrothermal synthesis. This method is effective in creating isolated boron sites within the zeolite framework. However, the study shows that this approach is not effective for creating catalysts for propane ODH.

The effectiveness of this incorporation method was critically evaluated using advanced characterization techniques, particularly solid-state NMR spectroscopy. These techniques revealed that nearly all boron atoms were incorporated into the framework as isolated sites. However, catalytic testing showed that these isolated BO3 sites were inactive for propane ODH.

This finding challenges the assumption that isolated active sites are always beneficial for catalysis. In the case of boron-based ODH catalysts, the study suggests that some degree of B-O-B connectivity is required for catalytic activity, rather than isolated BO3 sites.

The research concludes that active boron-based ODH catalysts likely require boron species with some degree of B-O-B connectivity, rather than the isolated sites found in B-MWW. This highlights the importance of understanding the specific structural requirements for different catalytic processes when designing and synthesizing catalysts.

B-based materials with 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks exhibit several structural characteristics that enhance catalytic performance:

1. Three-dimensional network structure: Materials like zeolites and ordered macroporous structures provide a framework with channels and cavities of molecular dimensions, allowing for high surface area and controlled access to active sites.

2. High surface area: Mesoporous silica supports, layered zeolites, and other porous materials offer large internal surface areas, increasing the number of accessible active sites.

3. Diverse boron species: Multiple types of boron species can be incorporated, including framework trigonal and tetrahedral boron, as well as terminal BOH groups. This diversity of active sites can contribute to improved catalytic activity and selectivity.

4. Micro-, meso-, and macroporous structures: The combination of different pore sizes improves mass transfer properties and accessibility of active sites.

5. Thermal stability: Zeolite frameworks and other robust structures provide high thermal stability, crucial for maintaining catalyst performance under harsh reaction conditions.

6. Hollow spheres and 3D ordered architectures: These structures provide high surface area, improved stability, and enhanced mass transfer properties.

Methods used to incorporate B active components into these structures include:

1. Isomorphous substitution: Replacing Al, Ti, Fe, or V atoms in zeolite frameworks with boron.
2. Direct synthesis: Incorporating boron during the initial material synthesis process.
3. Post-synthesis modification: Treating pre-formed materials with boron-containing compounds.
4. Impregnation: Used for preparing supported catalysts like B2O3/SBA-15.
5. Template-assisted synthesis: Used to create ordered macroporous BPO4 materials.
6. Core-shell synthesis: Employed to create B2O3@BPO4 sandwich-like hollow spheres.
7. Wash-coating: Applied to create monolithic catalysts.
8. Edge-functionalization: Hydroxylation of BN edges to increase active sites.
9. Precursor-based synthesis: Using boric acid and dicyanamide to synthesize BN with desired properties.
10. Assembly techniques: Creating 3D ordered architectures from 2D BN nanosheets.

The effectiveness of these methods varies depending on the desired catalytic application. Each method has its advantages and limitations, and the choice depends on the desired catalyst properties, reaction conditions, and scalability requirements for the specific catalytic application.

The literature does not directly discuss 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks for B-based materials. Instead, it focuses on enhancing the catalytic performance of hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) through surface modifications using plasma treatment. 

Key structural characteristics and methods for incorporating B active components include:

1. Surface Modification: Plasma treatment is used to modify the surface properties and composition of h-BN catalysts. This creates defects and introduces new chemical bonds, enhancing catalytic activity.

2. N-defects Creation: N2 plasma treatment is particularly effective in creating N-defects, especially three-boron center (TBC) defects. These defects serve as favorable sites for generating active species during the oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of propane.

3. Plasma Treatment Variations: Different plasma treatments (N2, O2, H2, and Ar) were evaluated. N2-treated BN showed the best performance with 26.0% propane conversion and 89.4% olefins selectivity.

4. Active Site Formation: TBC defects are believed to evolve into active BOx species under ODH reaction conditions, facilitating the conversion of propane to propylene.

5. Controlled Modification: Plasma technology allows for controlled modification of the catalyst surface, crucial for improving activity and understanding reaction mechanisms.

This approach enhances catalytic performance by creating specific defects and tailoring the local chemical environment of B-based catalysts. While not addressing 3-D porous frameworks directly, it demonstrates an effective method for creating active sites in B-based materials, potentially applicable to more complex structures.

The effectiveness of this method varies depending on the specific catalytic application, with the study focusing primarily on the ODH of propane. Further research would be needed to determine its applicability to other reactions or more complex B-based catalyst structures.

The structural characteristics of B-based materials with 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks include:

1. Ordered macroporous structure: An inverse replica of the template with interconnected macropores of average diameter 200 nm.
2. Large pore volume and high surface area: Abundant and fully interconnected macropores.
3. Hierarchical pore structure: Matrix of macropores bridged by ink-bottle neck-like channels of 80 nm in diameter.
4. Well-dispersed active sites: Tri-coordinated surface boron species identified as the active catalytic sites.
5. Tailored electronic properties: Different coordination environments (tri- vs tetra-coordinated) of boron sites influencing their electron density and binding properties.

These features enhance catalytic performance by:

1. Improving mass transport and reducing diffusion limitations.
2. Exposing a higher number of active sites.
3. Enabling better accessibility to reactive sites, especially under high space velocity conditions.
4. Allowing for lower reaction temperatures to achieve equivalent conversion.
5. Greatly improving yield due to enhanced kinetic diffusion.
6. Providing stability during catalytic reactions.

The main method used to incorporate B active components into these structures is hydrothermal-assisted synthesis using a hard template approach. This method involves:

1. Using boric acid as the boron source.
2. Employing polybenzoxazine polymer spheres as templates to create the ordered macroporous structure.
3. Calcination to remove the template and form the final BPO4 structure.

This approach is particularly effective for creating metal-free oxide catalysts with enhanced performance in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions. It allows for precise control over pore size, interconnectivity, and active site dispersion.

The effectiveness of this method for different catalytic applications varies:

1. Highly effective for reactions requiring improved mass transfer and high accessibility of active sites, such as oxidative dehydrogenation of propane.
2. May be less beneficial for reactions that are not diffusion-limited or require different types of active sites.
3. The balance between high surface area, accessible active sites, and structural stability is key to achieving high catalytic productivity and selectivity.

Overall, this method shows promise for creating catalysts with tailored properties, but its effectiveness should be evaluated on a case-by-case basis for different catalytic applications.

The structural characteristics of B-based materials with 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks, specifically h-BN/Cordierite, enhance catalytic performance in several ways:

1. Improved mass transfer: The well-developed straight-channel structure and thin wash-coated h-BN layer provide short diffusive pathways, ensuring efficient mass transfer even at high gas hourly space velocities (GHSV).

2. Enhanced heat transfer: The monolithic structure and excellent thermal conductivity of h-BN help optimize heat transfer during reactions, which is crucial for highly exothermic processes like ODHP.

3. Increased active site accessibility: The thin layer of h-BN coated on the cordierite surface improves the utilization of active sites, making them more accessible to reactants.

4. Suppression of secondary reactions: The optimized structure helps suppress deep oxidation reactions, leading to improved selectivity towards desired products like propylene and ethylene.

5. Facilitated gas-phase reactions: The straight-channel structure provides space for gas-phase radical reactions, contributing to higher propane conversion compared to h-BN powder.

The method used to incorporate B active components into these structures involves chemical vapor deposition (CVD) using boric acid and urea as precursors. This method is effective because:

1. It creates a uniform, thin layer of h-BN on the cordierite surface.
2. It promotes strong interactions between the h-BN and the cordierite support through hydrogen bonding and the formation of B-O-Si and B-O-Al linkages.
3. It allows for precise control of the h-BN loading by adjusting precursor concentrations.
4. It results in excellent adhesion between the h-BN layer and cordierite support without the need for additional binders.

For ODHP applications, this incorporation method is particularly effective as it creates a catalyst with high selectivity towards light olefins and improved productivity compared to traditional powder catalysts. The monolithic structure also allows for better control of reaction conditions, such as temperature and contact time, which are crucial for optimizing ODHP performance.

While this method has shown great promise for ODHP, its effectiveness for other catalytic applications would depend on the specific reaction requirements and desired catalyst properties. For reactions that require higher surface areas or different types of active sites, alternative incorporation methods might be more suitable.

The literature does not provide comprehensive information to fully analyze the structural characteristics of B-based materials with 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks or critically evaluate methods for incorporating B active components. However, it offers some relevant insights:

1. Structural characteristics: The study focuses on boron oxide supported on silica with different pore structures, suggesting a 3-D dispersed active site configuration. The spatial confinement of active boron sites, derived from the support structure, impacts catalytic performance.

2. Enhancement of catalytic performance: 
   - Boron-based catalysts exhibit high alkene selectivity in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP).
   - The degree of confinement of active boron sites affects the formation rate of propylene, with increased confinement leading to decreased rates.
   - The apparent activation energy increases with ODHP activity and shows a positive correlation with the apparent propane reaction order.

3. Incorporation of B active components:
   - While not explicitly discussed, the study implies that loading B2O3 on silica supports is a method used to create catalysts with dispersed boron sites.
   - The effectiveness of this method appears to depend on the pore structure of the support, the amount of B2O3 loaded, and the partial pressure of propane.

4. Impact on catalytic behavior:
   - The apparent propane reaction order for B2O3/SiO2 varies from 1 to 3, influenced by the pore structure of supports, B2O3 loading, and propane partial pressure.
   - This variation in reaction order indicates that the structural characteristics of the support and the distribution of boron species significantly impact catalytic behavior.

The study primarily focuses on kinetic investigations rather than structural characterization. Further research would be needed to provide a comprehensive analysis of 3-D dispersed active sites and critically evaluate the methods used to incorporate B active components for different catalytic applications.
