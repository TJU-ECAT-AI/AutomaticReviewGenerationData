Uniform dispersion: Boron species are uniformly anchored to the hydroxyl-rich MFI-type zeolite matrix, ensuring a homogeneous distribution of active sites throughout the catalyst.\n\n6. Oligomeric form: The boron species exist in an oligomeric form, which contributes to the construction of highly active boron centers.\n\nThese structural features enhance catalytic performance by:\n\n1.

Ensuring a uniform distribution of active sites for consistent catalytic performance\n\nMethods used to incorporate B active components into these structures include:\n\n1. Hydrothermal synthesis: The crystallinity of the zeolite is regulated by adjusting hydrothermal synthesis conditions, allowing for control over the formation of defect boron sites.\n\n2. Incomplete crystallization: This method is particularly effective in creating catalysts with low crystallinity and enriched defect boron sites, which exhibit superior activity in reactions like ODHP.\n\n3. Post-synthesis modification: Although not explicitly mentioned in the given text, this method is often used to introduce or modify boron species in zeolite frameworks.\n\nThe effectiveness of these methods varies depending on the specific catalytic application. For oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP), the incomplete crystallization method proves to be highly effective, as it results in a catalyst with high olefin productivity at low reaction temperatures and high weight-hour-space-velocity. The hydrothermal synthesis method allows for control over the crystallinity and distribution of boron species, which is crucial for tailoring the catalyst's properties for specific applications.\n\nIn conclusion, the incorporation of B active components into 3-D porous frameworks through methods that promote open coordination, hydrogen bonding, and the formation of defect sites appears to be highly effective for enhancing catalytic performance, particularly in low-temperature oxidative dehydrogenation reactions.", "Chinese": "具有三维分散活性位点的B基多孔框架材料，如硼硅分子筛，展现出几种增强催化性能的结构特征：\n\n1. 开放配位：硼物种以开放配位形式锚定在分子筛骨架上，使反应物能更好地接触活性位点。\n\n2. 氢键作用：表面上丰富的SiOH基团有助于与缺陷硼物种中的BOH形成氢键。这种相互作用不仅稳定了硼物种，还创造了催化活性中心。\n\n3. 动态转化：在催化过程中，孤立的硼物种可以动态转化为聚集态，这与催化活性的增加有关。\n\n4. 富缺陷结构：结晶度低的不完全结晶分子筛在低温下表现出优越的催化活性和更高的烯烃生产率。这归因于这些结构中缺陷硼位点的富集。\n\n5. 均匀分散：硼物种均匀地锚定在富含羟基的MFI型分子筛骨架上，确保活性位点在整个催化剂中均匀分布。\n\n6. 寡聚体形式：硼物种以寡聚体形式存在，有助于构建高活性硼中心。\n\n这些结构特征通过以下方式增强催化性能：\n\n1. 增加活性位点的可接近性和数量\n2. 稳定硼物种并防止过度流失\n3. 允许在反应过程中动态优化催化活性\n4. 创造高浓度的缺陷位点，这对某些反应至关重要\n5. 确保活性位点的均匀分布，以保持一致的催化性能\n\n将B活性组分引入这些结构的方法包括：\n\n1. 水热合成：通过调节水热合成条件来调控分子筛的结晶度，从而控制缺陷硼位点的形成。\n\n2. 不完全结晶：这种方法在创造低结晶度和富集缺陷硼位点的催化剂方面特别有效，这些催化剂在ODHP等反应中表现出优越的活性。\n\n3. 后合成修饰：虽然在给定文本中没有明确提到，但这种方法经常用于在分子筛骨架中引入或修饰硼物种。\n\n这些方法的有效性可能因催化应用的不同而有所差异。对于丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP），不完全结晶方法证明是非常有效的，因为它在低反应温度和高重时空速下产生了高烯烃生产率的催化剂。水热合成方法允许控制结晶度和硼物种的分布，这对于针对特定应用调整催化剂的性能至关重要。\n\n总之，通过促进开放配位、氢键形成和缺陷位点形成的方法将B活性组分引入三维多孔框架，似乎对增强催化性能非常有效，特别是在低温氧化脱氢反应中。", "Doi": "10.1016/j.jcat.2022.02.017"},
