          "Carbon nanofibres (CNFs) were modified with B and P by an exsitu approach. In addition, CNFs doped with N were prepared insitu using ethylenediamine as the N and C source."

"B-CNFs with different B loadings were prepared by the incipient wetness impregnation of aqueous boric acid solutions. Subsequently, the B-CNFs were calcined at 773K as the standard temperature in N2 atmosphere."

"Both the surface area and pore volume (Table1) increase after doping with only minor amounts of B (0.5wt% B). Further B doping diminishes the surface area and pore volume slightly, but the values are still larger than those for pristine CNFs."

"This suggests that boron does not plug the pores of the original CNFs, but instead covers the pore walls. The increased surface area and pore volume could be explained tentatively by the etching of some amorphous carbon during calcination at 773K in the presence of boric acid."

"The thermal stability increases by approximately 80K after only 0.5wt% B is deposited. The increase in thermal resistance is only marginal for further B loading."

"As the calcination temperature increases, the peak widens to higher BEs if the material is calcined above 973K and additionally widens to lower BEs if the material is calcined at a higher temperature of 1173K. This suggests that new B species develop as the calcination temperature increases."

"Pristine CNFs and CNFs with different B loadings were characterised texturally by N2 physisorption. All the isotherms are of Type IV with hysteresis loops at high relative pressures indicative of mesoporous materials."

"The samples exhibit a broad pore size distribution with a peak maximum at 58nm for pristine CNFs and at 80nm for CNFs after B doping (FigureS2)."

"Based on XPS assignments in the literature, after deconvolution of the spectra shown in Figure2, the peaks can be attributed to several B species summarised in Table2 and represented schematically in FigureS4."

"A peak at BE=192.7eV (B1), which is the predominant peak in B-CNF calcined at 673 and 773K, can be attributed to B linked to three O atoms isolated or a (BO3)n chain bonded to the zig-zag face of the graphite lattice (FigureS4a)."

          The structural characteristics of B-based materials with dispersed active sites in porous frameworks, as described in the literature, include:

1. Mesoporous structure: The materials show Type IV isotherms with hysteresis loops, indicating a mesoporous nature.

2. Increased surface area and pore volume: Doping with small amounts of B (0.5 wt%) increases both surface area and pore volume.

3. Broad pore size distribution: The pore sizes range from 58 nm for pristine CNFs to 80 nm for B-doped CNFs.

4. Boron distribution: B covers the pore walls without plugging the pores, maintaining the porous structure while introducing active sites.

5. Multiple B species: XPS analysis reveals different B species present in the structure, including B linked to three O atoms and (BO3)n chains bonded to the graphite lattice.

6. Enhanced thermal stability: B doping increases thermal stability by approximately 80K with 0.5 wt% B.

These structural features enhance catalytic performance by:

1. Providing more accessible active sites due to increased surface area and pore volume.
2. Maintaining pore structure and accessibility for efficient mass transfer.
3. Improving catalyst stability at higher temperatures.
4. Offering diverse B species as potential active sites for catalysis.

The main method used to incorporate B active components is incipient wetness impregnation of aqueous boric acid solutions, followed by calcination at 773K in N2 atmosphere. This method appears effective for creating well-dispersed B sites without compromising the porous structure of the CNFs.

The effectiveness of this method for different catalytic applications is not comprehensively evaluated in the given literature. For the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane, B-doped CNFs showed improved selectivity to propene compared to pristine CNFs, indicating effectiveness for this particular application. However, a critical evaluation across different reactions and comparison with other incorporation methods is not possible based solely on this information.

          文献中描述的具有分散活性位点的多孔框架B基材料的结构特征包括：

1. 介孔结构：材料显示IV型等温线和滞后环，表明具有介孔性质。

2. 增加的表面积和孔体积：用少量B（0.5 wt%）掺杂会增加表面积和孔体积。

3. 宽泛的孔径分布：孔径范围从原始CNFs的58 nm到B掺杂CNFs的80 nm。

4. 硼的分布：B覆盖在孔壁上而不堵塞孔隙，在引入活性位点的同时保持多孔结构。

5. 多种B物种：XPS分析显示结构中存在不同的B物种，包括与三个O原子连接的B和与石墨晶格结合的(BO3)n链。

6. 增强的热稳定性：0.5 wt% B掺杂使热稳定性提高约80K。

这些结构特征通过以下方式增强催化性能：

1. 由于表面积和孔体积增加，提供更多可接近的活性位点。
2. 保持孔结构和可接近性，实现高效的质量传递。
3. 提高催化剂在较高温度下的稳定性。
4. 提供多样的B物种作为潜在的催化活性位点。

用于引入B活性组分的主要方法是硼酸水溶液的浸渍法，随后在N2气氛下773K煅烧。这种方法似乎能有效地创造分散良好的B位点，而不影响CNFs的多孔结构。

给定的文献中没有全面评估这种方法对不同催化应用的有效性。对于丙烷氧化脱氢反应，B掺杂的CNFs与原始CNFs相比显示出更高的丙烯选择性，表明这种方法对这个特定应用是有效的。然而，仅基于这些信息无法对不同反应进行全面评估或与其他掺杂方法进行比较。
