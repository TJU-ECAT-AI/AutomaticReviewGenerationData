          "Hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) is a burgeoning catalyst for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) with impressive light olefins selectivity, which deserves further study to optimize the heat and mass transfer process with the aim of promoting the potential industrial application since ODHP is a highly exothermic process."

"The typical structure of h-BN/Cordierite with well-developed straight-channel and short diffusive pathway of the thin wash-coated h-BN layer guarantee the mass transfer process at high GHSV, achieving a high propylene space time yield of 18.6 gC3H6 gBN−1h−1 and improving the selectivity towards propylene and ethylene by suppressing secondary reactions of deep oxidation."

"The well-developed straight-channel structure of h-BN/Cordierite provides space for gas phase radical reactions, thus, propane conversion over h-BN/Cordierite is higher than that over h-BN powder."

"h-BN wash-coated cordierite monolithic catalyst was designed through a chemical vapor deposition method using boron acid and urea as precursors"

"Considering that the cordierite was composed of Al2O3, MgO and SiO2, hydroxyl groups will present on the surface of cordierite. The hydrogen bonds interaction can be formed between the surface OH of cordierite and BOH groups of H3BO3. In addition, CVD process could strength the interaction of boron species with cordierite in the form of BOSi and BOAl, which contributes to the outstanding adhesiveness between h-BN layer and cordierite."

          The structural characteristics of B-based materials with 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks, specifically h-BN/Cordierite, enhance catalytic performance in several ways:

1. Improved mass transfer: The well-developed straight-channel structure and thin wash-coated h-BN layer provide short diffusive pathways, ensuring efficient mass transfer even at high gas hourly space velocities (GHSV).

2. Enhanced heat transfer: The monolithic structure and excellent thermal conductivity of h-BN help optimize heat transfer during reactions, which is crucial for highly exothermic processes like ODHP.

3. Increased active site accessibility: The thin layer of h-BN coated on the cordierite surface improves the utilization of active sites, making them more accessible to reactants.

4. Suppression of secondary reactions: The optimized structure helps suppress deep oxidation reactions, leading to improved selectivity towards desired products like propylene and ethylene.

5. Facilitated gas-phase reactions: The straight-channel structure provides space for gas-phase radical reactions, contributing to higher propane conversion compared to h-BN powder.

The method used to incorporate B active components into these structures involves chemical vapor deposition (CVD) using boric acid and urea as precursors. This method is effective because:

1. It creates a uniform, thin layer of h-BN on the cordierite surface.
2. It promotes strong interactions between the h-BN and the cordierite support through hydrogen bonding and the formation of B-O-Si and B-O-Al linkages.
3. It allows for precise control of the h-BN loading by adjusting precursor concentrations.
4. It results in excellent adhesion between the h-BN layer and cordierite support without the need for additional binders.

For ODHP applications, this incorporation method is particularly effective as it creates a catalyst with high selectivity towards light olefins and improved productivity compared to traditional powder catalysts. The monolithic structure also allows for better control of reaction conditions, such as temperature and contact time, which are crucial for optimizing ODHP performance.

While this method has shown great promise for ODHP, its effectiveness for other catalytic applications would depend on the specific reaction requirements and desired catalyst properties. For reactions that require higher surface areas or different types of active sites, alternative incorporation methods might be more suitable.

          具有三维分散活性位点的B基材料在多孔框架中的结构特征，特别是h-BN/堇青石，通过以下几种方式提高催化性能：

1. 改善质量传递：发达的直通道结构和薄的涂覆h-BN层提供了短的扩散路径，确保即使在高气体小时空速（GHSV）下也能实现高效的质量传递。

2. 增强热传递：整体结构和h-BN优异的热导率有助于优化反应过程中的热传递，这对于ODHP等强放热过程至关重要。

3. 提高活性位点可及性：涂覆在堇青石表面的薄层h-BN提高了活性位点的利用率，使反应物更容易接触到这些位点。

4. 抑制次级反应：优化的结构有助于抑制深度氧化反应，从而提高了对丙烯和乙烯等目标产物的选择性。

5. 促进气相反应：直通道结构为气相自由基反应提供了空间，与h-BN粉末相比，有助于提高丙烷转化率。

将B活性组分引入这些结构的方法涉及使用硼酸和尿素作为前驱体的化学气相沉积（CVD）。这种方法之所以有效，是因为：

1. 它在堇青石表面创造了均匀、薄的h-BN层。
2. 通过氢键和B-O-Si和B-O-Al键的形成，促进了h-BN与堇青石载体之间的强相互作用。
3. 它允许通过调整前驱体浓度来精确控制h-BN的负载量。
4. 它在h-BN层和堇青石载体之间形成了优异的粘附性，无需额外的粘合剂。

对于ODHP应用，这种引入方法特别有效，因为它创造了一种对轻烯烃具有高选择性和改善生产力的催化剂，相比传统的粉末催化剂更为优越。整体结构还允许更好地控制反应条件，如温度和接触时间，这对于优化ODHP性能至关重要。

虽然这种方法在ODHP方面显示出巨大潜力，但对其他催化应用的有效性将取决于特定的反应要求和所需的催化剂性质。对于需要更高比表面积或不同类型活性位点的反应，可能需要采用其他引入方法。
