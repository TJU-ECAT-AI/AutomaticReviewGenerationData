          [1] "Boron-based catalysts exhibit high alkene selectivity in ODHP, but the understanding of catalytic mechanism remains incomplete, especially regarding the observed supra-linear reaction order of alkanes."

[2] "We studied the impact of spatial confinement on the performance and kinetics of boron oxide supported on silica with different pore structures."

[3] "The formation rate of propylene decreases with the degree of confinement of active boron sites derived from the support."

[4] "The apparent activation energy increases with the ODHP activity, and exhibits a positive correlation with the apparent propane reaction order."

[5] "The apparent propane order of B2O3/SiO2 varies from 1 to 3, which is impacted by pore structure of supports, loading of B2O3, and partial pressure of propane."

          The literature does not provide comprehensive information to fully analyze the structural characteristics of B-based materials with 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks or critically evaluate methods for incorporating B active components. However, it offers some relevant insights:

1. Structural characteristics: The study focuses on boron oxide supported on silica with different pore structures, suggesting a 3-D dispersed active site configuration. The spatial confinement of active boron sites, derived from the support structure, impacts catalytic performance.

2. Enhancement of catalytic performance: 
   - Boron-based catalysts exhibit high alkene selectivity in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP).
   - The degree of confinement of active boron sites affects the formation rate of propylene, with increased confinement leading to decreased rates.
   - The apparent activation energy increases with ODHP activity and shows a positive correlation with the apparent propane reaction order.

3. Incorporation of B active components:
   - While not explicitly discussed, the study implies that loading B2O3 on silica supports is a method used to create catalysts with dispersed boron sites.
   - The effectiveness of this method appears to depend on the pore structure of the support, the amount of B2O3 loaded, and the partial pressure of propane.

4. Impact on catalytic behavior:
   - The apparent propane reaction order for B2O3/SiO2 varies from 1 to 3, influenced by the pore structure of supports, B2O3 loading, and propane partial pressure.
   - This variation in reaction order indicates that the structural characteristics of the support and the distribution of boron species significantly impact catalytic behavior.

The study primarily focuses on kinetic investigations rather than structural characterization. Further research would be needed to provide a comprehensive analysis of 3-D dispersed active sites and critically evaluate the methods used to incorporate B active components for different catalytic applications.

          文献没有提供足够的信息来全面分析具有3-D分散活性位点的B基材料在多孔框架中的结构特征，或批判性地评估将B活性组分纳入这些结构的方法。然而，它提供了一些相关见解：

1. 结构特征：研究集中在具有不同孔结构的硅胶上负载的三氧化二硼，这表明存在3-D分散的活性位点配置。源自载体结构的活性硼位点的空间限制影响催化性能。

2. 催化性能的增强：
   - 硼基催化剂在丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）中表现出高烯烃选择性。
   - 活性硼位点的限制程度影响丙烯的生成速率，限制程度增加导致速率降低。
   - 表观活化能随ODHP活性增加而增加，并与表观丙烷反应级数呈正相关。

3. B活性组分的引入：
   - 虽然没有明确讨论，但研究暗示在二氧化硅载体上负载B2O3是创建具有分散硼位点的催化剂的一种方法。
   - 这种方法的有效性似乎取决于载体的孔结构、负载的B2O3量和丙烷的分压。

4. 对催化行为的影响：
   - B2O3/SiO2的表观丙烷反应级数从1到3不等，受载体的孔结构、B2O3负载量和丙烷分压的影响。
   - 反应级数的这种变化表明，载体的结构特征和硼物种的分布显著影响催化行为。

该研究主要集中在动力学研究上，而不是结构表征。需要进一步的研究来提供3-D分散活性位点的全面分析，并批判性地评估用于不同催化应用的B活性组分引入方法。
