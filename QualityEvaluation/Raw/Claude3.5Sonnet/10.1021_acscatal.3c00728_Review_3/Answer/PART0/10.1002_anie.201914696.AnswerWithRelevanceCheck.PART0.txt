          "Solid-state NMR spectroscopy of hydrothermally synthesized B-MWW reveals that boron is fully incorporated into the zeolite framework as trivalent BO3 units. These isolated sites are inactive for oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of propane, which refutes the hypothesis that site-isolated boron species are the active site on boron-containing ODH catalysts."

"Using 11B solid-state NMR spectroscopy, we show that the majority of boron species in B-MWW exist as isolated BO3 units, fully incorporated into the zeolite framework. However, this material shows no catalytic activity for ODH of propane to propene."

"B-MWW was hydrothermally synthesized according to an established literature procedure"

"Based upon the analytical simulations, B(OSi)3 units make up ca. 90% of the boron incorporated into the framework. The peak with δiso(11B) = 15 ppm and ca. 10% integrated intensity is assigned to a B(OSi)2(OH) species consisting of two bonds to the framework and a terminal hydroxide."

"In summary, the 11B chemical shifts suggest that in B-MWW nearly all boron atoms are incorporated into the framework. The SSNMR data also suggests that these sites are well separated (>34Å apart) from one another, for the reasons given below."

"All of these observations confirm the hypothesis that catalytically inactive B-MWW consist of predominately isolated boron sites incorporated into the zeolite framework, while the active ODH catalyst B/B-MWW contains some partially aggregated boron sites."

"The difference in boron sites in B-MWW and these other boron materials leads us to the important conclusion that the boron-catalyzed ODH of propane does not proceed over an isolated BO3 site. Rather, active boron-based ODH catalysts likely requires boron species with some degree of B-O-B connectivity."

          The structural characteristics of B-based materials with 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks, such as B-MWW zeolite, include:

1. Boron is fully incorporated into the zeolite framework as trivalent BO3 units.
2. The majority (about 90%) of boron species exist as isolated B(OSi)3 units.
3. A minor portion (about 10%) exists as B(OSi)2(OH) units.
4. These boron sites are well-separated, with distances greater than 3-4 Å between them.

However, contrary to expectations, these structural features do not enhance catalytic performance for oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of propane. In fact, the isolated boron sites in the zeolite framework are catalytically inactive for this reaction.

The method used to incorporate B active components into these structures is hydrothermal synthesis. This method is effective in creating isolated boron sites within the zeolite framework. However, the study shows that this approach is not effective for creating catalysts for propane ODH.

The effectiveness of this incorporation method was critically evaluated using advanced characterization techniques, particularly solid-state NMR spectroscopy. These techniques revealed that nearly all boron atoms were incorporated into the framework as isolated sites. However, catalytic testing showed that these isolated BO3 sites were inactive for propane ODH.

This finding challenges the assumption that isolated active sites are always beneficial for catalysis. In the case of boron-based ODH catalysts, the study suggests that some degree of B-O-B connectivity is required for catalytic activity, rather than isolated BO3 sites.

The research concludes that active boron-based ODH catalysts likely require boron species with some degree of B-O-B connectivity, rather than the isolated sites found in B-MWW. This highlights the importance of understanding the specific structural requirements for different catalytic processes when designing and synthesizing catalysts.

          具有3-D分散活性位点的B基材料在多孔框架中的结构特征，如B-MWW沸石，包括：

1. 硼完全以三价BO3单元的形式掺入沸石框架中。
2. 大多数（约90%）的硼物种以孤立的B(OSi)3单元存在。
3. 少部分（约10%）为B(OSi)2(OH)单元。
4. 这些硼位点分布分散，相互之间的距离大于3-4 Å。

然而，与预期相反，这些结构特征并未增强丙烷氧化脱氢（ODH）的催化性能。事实上，沸石框架中的孤立硼位点对这种反应没有催化活性。

将B活性组分掺入这些结构的主要方法是水热合成。这种方法有效地在沸石框架内创建了孤立的硼位点。然而，研究表明，这种方法对于创建丙烷ODH催化剂并不有效。

使用先进的表征技术，特别是固态核磁共振波谱，对这种掺入方法的有效性进行了严格评估。这些技术揭示了几乎所有的硼原子都以孤立位点的形式掺入框架中。然而，催化测试表明，这些孤立的BO3位点对丙烷ODH无活性。

这一发现挑战了孤立活性位点总是有利于催化的假设。对于硼基ODH催化剂，研究表明需要一定程度的B-O-B连接性，而不是孤立的BO3位点。

研究得出结论，活性硼基ODH催化剂可能需要具有一定程度B-O-B连接的硼物种，而不是B-MWW中发现的孤立位点。这强调了在设计和合成催化剂时，理解不同催化过程的特定结构要求的重要性。
