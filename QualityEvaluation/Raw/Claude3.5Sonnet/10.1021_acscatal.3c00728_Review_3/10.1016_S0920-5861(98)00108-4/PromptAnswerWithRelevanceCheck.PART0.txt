The given literature does not contain any information about the structural characteristics of B-based materials with 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks or methods to incorporate B active components into these structures. The document primarily discusses catalytic oxidation of propane using various catalysts, including V2O5-based, rare-earth oxide-based, and B2O3/Al2O3 catalysts. It does not provide specific details about 3-D dispersed B-based materials or their synthesis methods.

The literature only mentions B2O3/Al2O3 catalysts briefly, focusing on their catalytic performance in propane oxidation rather than their structural characteristics or synthesis methods. Without more relevant information, it is not possible to analyze the structural features, evaluate incorporation methods, or discuss their effectiveness for different catalytic applications as requested in the question.

给定的文献中没有关于具有三维分散活性位点的B基多孔框架材料的结构特征或将B活性组分引入这些结构的方法的信息。该文档主要讨论了使用各种催化剂进行丙烷的催化氧化,包括V2O5基、稀土氧化物基和B2O3/Al2O3催化剂。它没有提供有关三维分散B基材料或其合成方法的具体细节。

文献仅简要提及B2O3/Al2O3催化剂,主要关注其在丙烷氧化中的催化性能,而不是其结构特征或合成方法。由于缺乏更多相关信息,无法按问题要求分析结构特征、评估引入方法或讨论它们在不同催化应用中的有效性。

The given literature does not contain any information about the structural characteristics of B-based materials with 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks or methods to incorporate B active components into these structures. The document focuses on catalytic oxidation of propane using different types of catalysts, including V2O5-based, rare-earth oxide-based, and B2O3/Al2O3 catalysts. It does not discuss 3-D dispersed active sites or porous frameworks for B-based materials.

The literature only briefly mentions B2O3/Al2O3 catalysts in the context of propane oxidation, stating that propane activation likely occurs on Lewis acid sites with the formation of propyl radicals. However, it does not provide detailed information about the structural characteristics or incorporation methods for B-based materials in porous frameworks.

Given the lack of relevant information in the provided literature, this question cannot be adequately answered based solely on the given text.

给定的文献中没有包含关于具有三维分散活性位点的B基材料的结构特征,或将B活性组分引入这些结构的方法的信息。该文档主要关注使用不同类型催化剂(包括V2O5基、稀土氧化物基和B2O3/Al2O3催化剂)的丙烷催化氧化。它没有讨论B基材料的三维分散活性位点或多孔框架。

文献仅在丙烷氧化的背景下简要提到了B2O3/Al2O3催化剂,指出丙烷活化可能发生在Lewis酸性位点上,形成丙基自由基。然而,它没有提供关于B基材料在多孔框架中的结构特征或引入方法的详细信息。

鉴于所提供的文献中缺乏相关信息,仅基于给定的文本无法充分回答这个问题。

The given literature does not contain any information about the structural characteristics of B-based materials with 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks or methods of incorporating B active components into these structures. The document mainly discusses the catalytic performance of B2O3/Al2O3 catalysts in the oxidative conversion of propane, but does not go into detail about the structural features or preparation methods of B-based porous materials. Therefore, this question cannot be adequately answered based solely on the information provided in the given literature.

给定的文献中没有包含关于具有三维分散活性位点的多孔框架中B基材料的结构特征,或将B活性组分引入这些结构的方法的信息。该文档主要讨论了B2O3/Al2O3催化剂在丙烷氧化转化中的催化性能,但没有详细介绍B基多孔材料的结构特征或制备方法。因此,仅基于给定文献中提供的信息,无法充分回答这个问题。

[1] "B2O3-containing catalysts were chosen taking into account the above classification. The aim of the work was to compare the catalytic performance of these systems, which is expected to activate propane in different ways."

[2] "As reported earlier [20], the dissociative adsorption of both oxygen and propane is suppressed on B2O3 (30 wt%)/γ-Al2O3 catalyst as confirmed by HD and oxygen isotopic exchange reactions."

[3] "Thus, the boria/alumina catalyst possesses most likely a Lewis acidity which determines the activation of propane."

[4] "Boriaalumina catalysts show high propene and oxygenates selectivities even at degrees of propane conversions higher than 20%. The unique performance of this catalyst is most probably due to B2O3 being, however, melted under reaction conditions"

The literature does not provide sufficient information to fully analyze the structural characteristics of B-based materials with 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks or critically evaluate methods for incorporating B active components. However, some insights can be drawn from the available information:

1. B2O3-containing catalysts, specifically B2O3/Al2O3, are discussed as one type of catalyst for propane activation.

2. The B2O3/Al2O3 catalyst suppresses dissociative adsorption of oxygen and propane, which distinguishes it from other catalyst types.

3. The catalyst likely possesses Lewis acidity, which is believed to be responsible for propane activation.

4. B2O3/Al2O3 catalysts show high selectivity for propene and oxygenates, even at higher propane conversion rates.

5. The unique performance is attributed to B2O3, which melts under reaction conditions.

These points suggest that the B-based catalyst has a unique structure and mechanism compared to other catalysts discussed, but the document does not provide detailed information on 3-D dispersion or porous frameworks. The incorporation method is not explicitly described, but it's mentioned that B2O3 is present at 30 wt% on γ-Al2O3.

To fully answer the question, more specific information on the structural characteristics, 3-D dispersion, and incorporation methods would be needed.

文献中没有提供足够的信息来全面分析具有三维分散活性位点的多孔框架B基材料的结构特征，或者批判性地评估将B活性组分引入这些结构的方法。然而，从可用信息中可以得出一些见解：

1. 文中讨论了含B2O3的催化剂，特别是B2O3/Al2O3，作为丙烷活化的一种催化剂类型。

2. B2O3/Al2O3催化剂抑制了氧气和丙烷的解离吸附，这使其与其他类型的催化剂有所不同。

3. 该催化剂可能具有Lewis酸性，被认为是负责丙烷活化的原因。

4. B2O3/Al2O3催化剂即使在较高的丙烷转化率下也表现出对丙烯和含氧化合物的高选择性。

5. 其独特的性能归因于B2O3，它在反应条件下会熔化。

这些点表明，与讨论的其他催化剂相比，B基催化剂具有独特的结构和机制，但文档并未提供关于三维分散或多孔框架的详细信息。虽然没有明确描述引入方法，但提到B2O3在γ-Al2O3上的含量为30 wt%。

要全面回答这个问题，还需要更多关于结构特征、三维分散和引入方法的具体信息。
