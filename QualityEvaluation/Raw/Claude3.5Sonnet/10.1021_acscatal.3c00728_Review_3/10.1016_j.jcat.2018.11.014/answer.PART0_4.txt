[1] "Silicon boride (SiB3-6), a metal-free material enriching in boron sites, exhibits good oxidation resistance property at high temperature and could be as a potential catalyst for ODH of light alkanes."

[2] "The stability was evidenced by the operation of a 100-h test with steady conversion and product selectivity."

[3] "The difference of selectivity between silicon boride with other boron-containing catalysts maybe resulted from the different subsurface structure"

[4] "To further identify the active sites, the structure evolution of the silicon boride catalyst before and after activation was characterized by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis."

[5] "Furthermore, a higher binding energy of the B 1s signal located at 193.8eV was detected for SiB-1h and SiB-3h catalysts, which was assigned to the boron oxide (B2O3, Fig. 2 b)."

The literature does not provide sufficient information to fully analyze the structural characteristics of B-based materials with 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks or critically evaluate methods for incorporating B active components into these structures.

However, the study does discuss some relevant aspects of silicon boride as a B-based catalyst:

1. Silicon boride (SiB3-6) is described as a metal-free material enriched with boron sites, exhibiting good oxidation resistance at high temperatures.

2. The catalyst showed high stability, maintaining steady conversion and product selectivity over a 100-hour test.

3. The catalytic performance, particularly selectivity, of silicon boride differs from other boron-containing catalysts, which may be due to differences in subsurface structure.

4. XPS analysis was used to study the evolution of active sites on the silicon boride catalyst surface before and after activation.

5. After activation, boron oxide (B2O3) species were detected on the catalyst surface, which may contribute to its catalytic activity.

While these points provide some insight into the structural characteristics and incorporation of B active components in silicon boride, they do not fully address the question's focus on 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks or compare different methods of incorporating B active components. The study primarily focuses on silicon boride as a specific B-based catalyst rather than providing a broader analysis of B-based materials with 3-D dispersed active sites.

该文献没有提供足够的信息来全面分析具有三维分散活性位点的多孔框架中B基材料的结构特征，或对将B活性组分掺入这些结构的方法进行批判性评估。

然而，该研究确实讨论了硅硼化物作为B基催化剂的一些相关方面：

1. 硅硼化物(SiB3-6)被描述为一种富含硼位点的无金属材料，在高温下表现出良好的抗氧化性。

2. 该催化剂显示出高稳定性，在100小时的测试中保持稳定的转化率和产品选择性。

3. 硅硼化物的催化性能，特别是选择性，与其他含硼催化剂不同，这可能是由于亚表面结构的差异。

4. 使用XPS分析来研究硅硼化物催化剂表面活性位点在活化前后的演变。

5. 活化后，在催化剂表面检测到三氧化二硼(B2O3)物种，这可能有助于其催化活性。

虽然这些点提供了一些关于硅硼化物中B活性组分的结构特征和掺入的见解，但它们并没有完全解答问题中关于多孔框架中三维分散活性位点的重点，也没有比较掺入B活性组分的不同方法。该研究主要关注硅硼化物作为一种特定的B基催化剂，而不是对具有三维分散活性位点的B基材料进行更广泛的分析。
