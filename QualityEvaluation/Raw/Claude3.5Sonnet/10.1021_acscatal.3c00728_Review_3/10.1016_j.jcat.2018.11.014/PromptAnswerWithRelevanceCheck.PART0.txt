[1] "Silicon boride (SiB3-6), a metal-free material enriching in boron sites, exhibits good oxidation resistance property at high temperature and could be as a potential catalyst for ODH of light alkanes."

[2] "The stability was evidenced by the operation of a 100-h test with steady conversion and product selectivity."

[3] "The difference of selectivity between silicon boride with other boron-containing catalysts maybe resulted from the different subsurface structure"

[4] "To further identify the active sites, the structure evolution of the silicon boride catalyst before and after activation was characterized by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis."

[5] "Upon exposure to the ODH of propane reaction (535C), the surface oxygen concentrations increased to 50.4% after 1h (SiB-1h) and 54.8% after 3h (SiB-3h)"

The literature does not provide sufficient information to fully analyze the structural characteristics of B-based materials with 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks or evaluate methods for incorporating B active components. The study focuses primarily on silicon boride as a catalyst for oxidative dehydrogenation of light alkanes.

However, some insights can be drawn from the available information:

1. Silicon boride (SiB3-6) is described as a metal-free material enriched with boron sites, suggesting a structure where boron is dispersed throughout the material.

2. The catalyst exhibits good oxidation resistance at high temperatures, indicating a stable structure that can withstand harsh reaction conditions.

3. The material undergoes surface changes during activation and reaction, with increased oxygen concentration and formation of boron-oxygen species. This suggests that the active sites are primarily on the surface rather than in a 3-D porous framework.

4. The stability of the catalyst over a 100-hour test demonstrates that the active sites remain accessible and effective over extended periods.

5. The difference in selectivity between silicon boride and other boron-containing catalysts is attributed to differences in subsurface structure, highlighting the importance of the overall material structure in determining catalytic performance.

The study does not discuss specific methods for incorporating B active components into the structure, as silicon boride is used as a starting material. The activation process involves exposing the material to reaction conditions, which leads to the formation of active boron-oxygen species on the surface.

In conclusion, while this study provides some insights into the use of boron-containing materials as catalysts, it does not offer a comprehensive analysis of 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks or methods for incorporating B active components into such structures.

该文献没有提供足够的信息来全面分析具有3-D分散活性位点的多孔框架B基材料的结构特征，或评估将B活性成分纳入这些结构的方法。该研究主要集中在硅硼化物作为轻烷烃氧化脱氢催化剂的应用。

然而，从可用信息中可以得出一些见解：

1. 硅硼化物(SiB3-6)被描述为一种富含硼位点的无金属材料，这表明硼在整个材料中是分散的。

2. 该催化剂在高温下表现出良好的抗氧化性能，表明其结构稳定，能够承受苛刻的反应条件。

3. 在活化和反应过程中，材料表面发生变化，氧浓度增加，形成硼-氧物种。这表明活性位点主要位于表面，而不是在3-D多孔框架中。

4. 该催化剂在100小时测试中的稳定性表明，活性位点在长时间内保持可访问和有效。

5. 硅硼化物与其他含硼催化剂之间的选择性差异归因于亚表面结构的不同，这突出了整体材料结构在决定催化性能方面的重要性。

该研究没有讨论将B活性成分纳入结构的具体方法，因为硅硼化物被用作起始材料。活化过程涉及将材料暴露在反应条件下，这导致表面形成活性硼-氧物种。

总之，虽然这项研究为含硼材料作为催化剂的使用提供了一些见解，但它并没有对多孔框架中的3-D分散活性位点或将B活性成分纳入这些结构的方法进行全面分析。

[1] "Silicon boride (SiB3-6), a metal-free material enriching in boron sites, exhibits good oxidation resistance property at high temperature and could be as a potential catalyst for ODH of light alkanes."

[2] "The functionalised silicon boride showed high ODH activity for light alkanes; more importantly, the antioxidant ability of silicon boride ensured the catalytic stability."

[3] "To better understand the activation and reaction process, XRD measurement was performed to trace the structure evolution of the silicon boride catalyst under different conditions, including heated to 535C, activated in oxygen or reaction atmosphere and then cooled to room temperature"

[4] "After being subjected to ODH reaction, the catalyst retained the bulk structure of silicon boride (Fig. S1), suggesting that the oxyfunctionalization may only occur on the surface of catalyst."

The literature does not provide detailed information about 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks for B-based materials. The study focuses on silicon boride (SiB3-6) as a metal-free catalyst for oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of light alkanes.

The structural characteristics mentioned include:
1. Enrichment of boron sites in silicon boride
2. Good oxidation resistance at high temperatures
3. Retention of bulk structure after ODH reactions
4. Surface oxyfunctionalization during catalysis

These features enhance catalytic performance by providing stable active sites and allowing for surface modifications without compromising the overall structure. The oxidation resistance contributes to the catalyst's stability.

The method used to incorporate B active components involved functionalizing silicon boride, though specific details are not provided. The effectiveness of this approach is demonstrated through high ODH activity for light alkanes and good catalytic stability.

However, the document does not discuss 3-D dispersed active sites or porous frameworks, nor does it compare different methods of incorporating B active components for various catalytic applications. The focus is primarily on silicon boride as a specific B-containing catalyst for ODH reactions.

该文献没有提供关于B基材料在多孔框架中3-D分散活性位点的详细信息。研究主要集中在硅硼化物(SiB3-6)作为一种无金属催化剂用于轻烃的氧化脱氢(ODH)反应。

提到的结构特征包括：
1. 硅硼化物中富含硼位点
2. 高温下具有良好的抗氧化性
3. ODH反应后保持体相结构
4. 催化过程中表面发生氧化官能化

这些特征通过提供稳定的活性位点并允许表面修饰而不影响整体结构来增强催化性能。抗氧化性有助于催化剂的稳定性。

所使用的引入B活性组分的方法涉及对硅硼化物进行功能化，尽管没有提供具体细节。这种方法的有效性通过对轻烃的高ODH活性和良好的催化稳定性得到证实。

然而，该文档并未讨论3-D分散活性位点或多孔框架，也没有比较将B活性组分引入各种催化应用的不同方法。研究主要集中在硅硼化物作为ODH反应的特定含B催化剂上。

The literature does not provide sufficient information to fully analyze the structural characteristics of B-based materials with 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks or critically evaluate methods for incorporating B active components into these structures.

However, the study does discuss some relevant aspects of silicon boride as a B-based catalyst:

1. Silicon boride (SiB3-6) is described as a metal-free material enriched with boron sites, exhibiting good oxidation resistance at high temperatures.

2. The catalyst showed high stability, maintaining steady conversion and product selectivity over a 100-hour test.

3. The catalytic performance, particularly selectivity, of silicon boride differs from other boron-containing catalysts, which may be due to differences in subsurface structure.

4. XPS analysis was used to study the evolution of active sites on the silicon boride catalyst surface before and after activation.

5. After activation, boron oxide (B2O3) species were detected on the catalyst surface, which may contribute to its catalytic activity.

While these points provide some insight into the structural characteristics and incorporation of B active components in silicon boride, they do not fully address the question's focus on 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks or compare different methods of incorporating B active components. The study primarily focuses on silicon boride as a specific B-based catalyst rather than providing a broader analysis of B-based materials with 3-D dispersed active sites.

该文献没有提供足够的信息来全面分析具有三维分散活性位点的多孔框架中B基材料的结构特征，或对将B活性组分掺入这些结构的方法进行批判性评估。

然而，该研究确实讨论了硅硼化物作为B基催化剂的一些相关方面：

1. 硅硼化物(SiB3-6)被描述为一种富含硼位点的无金属材料，在高温下表现出良好的抗氧化性。

2. 该催化剂显示出高稳定性，在100小时的测试中保持稳定的转化率和产品选择性。

3. 硅硼化物的催化性能，特别是选择性，与其他含硼催化剂不同，这可能是由于亚表面结构的差异。

4. 使用XPS分析来研究硅硼化物催化剂表面活性位点在活化前后的演变。

5. 活化后，在催化剂表面检测到三氧化二硼(B2O3)物种，这可能有助于其催化活性。

虽然这些点提供了一些关于硅硼化物中B活性组分的结构特征和掺入的见解，但它们并没有完全解答问题中关于多孔框架中三维分散活性位点的重点，也没有比较掺入B活性组分的不同方法。该研究主要关注硅硼化物作为一种特定的B基催化剂，而不是对具有三维分散活性位点的B基材料进行更广泛的分析。
