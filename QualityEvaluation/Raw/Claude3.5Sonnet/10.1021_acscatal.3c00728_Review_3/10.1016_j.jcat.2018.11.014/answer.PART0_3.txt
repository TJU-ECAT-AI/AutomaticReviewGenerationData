[1] "Silicon boride (SiB3-6), a metal-free material enriching in boron sites, exhibits good oxidation resistance property at high temperature and could be as a potential catalyst for ODH of light alkanes."

[2] "The functionalised silicon boride showed high ODH activity for light alkanes; more importantly, the antioxidant ability of silicon boride ensured the catalytic stability."

[3] "To better understand the activation and reaction process, XRD measurement was performed to trace the structure evolution of the silicon boride catalyst under different conditions, including heated to 535C, activated in oxygen or reaction atmosphere and then cooled to room temperature"

[4] "After being subjected to ODH reaction, the catalyst retained the bulk structure of silicon boride (Fig. S1), suggesting that the oxyfunctionalization may only occur on the surface of catalyst."

The literature does not provide detailed information about 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks for B-based materials. The study focuses on silicon boride (SiB3-6) as a metal-free catalyst for oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of light alkanes.

The structural characteristics mentioned include:
1. Enrichment of boron sites in silicon boride
2. Good oxidation resistance at high temperatures
3. Retention of bulk structure after ODH reactions
4. Surface oxyfunctionalization during catalysis

These features enhance catalytic performance by providing stable active sites and allowing for surface modifications without compromising the overall structure. The oxidation resistance contributes to the catalyst's stability.

The method used to incorporate B active components involved functionalizing silicon boride, though specific details are not provided. The effectiveness of this approach is demonstrated through high ODH activity for light alkanes and good catalytic stability.

However, the document does not discuss 3-D dispersed active sites or porous frameworks, nor does it compare different methods of incorporating B active components for various catalytic applications. The focus is primarily on silicon boride as a specific B-containing catalyst for ODH reactions.

该文献没有提供关于B基材料在多孔框架中3-D分散活性位点的详细信息。研究主要集中在硅硼化物(SiB3-6)作为一种无金属催化剂用于轻烃的氧化脱氢(ODH)反应。

提到的结构特征包括：
1. 硅硼化物中富含硼位点
2. 高温下具有良好的抗氧化性
3. ODH反应后保持体相结构
4. 催化过程中表面发生氧化官能化

这些特征通过提供稳定的活性位点并允许表面修饰而不影响整体结构来增强催化性能。抗氧化性有助于催化剂的稳定性。

所使用的引入B活性组分的方法涉及对硅硼化物进行功能化，尽管没有提供具体细节。这种方法的有效性通过对轻烃的高ODH活性和良好的催化稳定性得到证实。

然而，该文档并未讨论3-D分散活性位点或多孔框架，也没有比较将B活性组分引入各种催化应用的不同方法。研究主要集中在硅硼化物作为ODH反应的特定含B催化剂上。
