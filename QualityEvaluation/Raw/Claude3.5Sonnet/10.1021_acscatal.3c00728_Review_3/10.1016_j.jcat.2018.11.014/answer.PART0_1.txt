The literature does not provide sufficient information to fully analyze the structural characteristics of B-based materials with 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks or evaluate methods for incorporating B active components. The study focuses primarily on silicon boride as a catalyst for oxidative dehydrogenation of light alkanes.

However, some insights can be drawn from the available information:

1. Silicon boride (SiB3-6) is described as a metal-free material enriched with boron sites, suggesting a structure where boron is dispersed throughout the material.

2. The catalyst exhibits good oxidation resistance at high temperatures, indicating a stable structure that can withstand harsh reaction conditions.

3. The material undergoes surface changes during activation and reaction, with increased oxygen concentration and formation of boron-oxygen species. This suggests that the active sites are primarily on the surface rather than in a 3-D porous framework.

4. The stability of the catalyst over a 100-hour test demonstrates that the active sites remain accessible and effective over extended periods.

5. The difference in selectivity between silicon boride and other boron-containing catalysts is attributed to differences in subsurface structure, highlighting the importance of the overall material structure in determining catalytic performance.

The study does not discuss specific methods for incorporating B active components into the structure, as silicon boride is used as a starting material. The activation process involves exposing the material to reaction conditions, which leads to the formation of active boron-oxygen species on the surface.

In conclusion, while this study provides some insights into the use of boron-containing materials as catalysts, it does not offer a comprehensive analysis of 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks or methods for incorporating B active components into such structures.

该文献没有提供足够的信息来全面分析具有3-D分散活性位点的多孔框架B基材料的结构特征，或评估将B活性成分纳入这些结构的方法。该研究主要集中在硅硼化物作为轻烷烃氧化脱氢催化剂的应用。

然而，从可用信息中可以得出一些见解：

1. 硅硼化物(SiB3-6)被描述为一种富含硼位点的无金属材料，这表明硼在整个材料中是分散的。

2. 该催化剂在高温下表现出良好的抗氧化性能，表明其结构稳定，能够承受苛刻的反应条件。

3. 在活化和反应过程中，材料表面发生变化，氧浓度增加，形成硼-氧物种。这表明活性位点主要位于表面，而不是在3-D多孔框架中。

4. 该催化剂在100小时测试中的稳定性表明，活性位点在长时间内保持可访问和有效。

5. 硅硼化物与其他含硼催化剂之间的选择性差异归因于亚表面结构的不同，这突出了整体材料结构在决定催化性能方面的重要性。

该研究没有讨论将B活性成分纳入结构的具体方法，因为硅硼化物被用作起始材料。活化过程涉及将材料暴露在反应条件下，这导致表面形成活性硼-氧物种。

总之，虽然这项研究为含硼材料作为催化剂的使用提供了一些见解，但它并没有对多孔框架中的3-D分散活性位点或将B活性成分纳入这些结构的方法进行全面分析。
