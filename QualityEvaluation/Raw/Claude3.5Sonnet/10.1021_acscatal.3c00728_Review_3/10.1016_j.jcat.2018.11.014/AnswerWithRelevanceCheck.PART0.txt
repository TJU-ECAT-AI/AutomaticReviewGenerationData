          [1] "Silicon boride (SiB3-6), a metal-free material enriching in boron sites, exhibits good oxidation resistance property at high temperature and could be as a potential catalyst for ODH of light alkanes."

[2] "The stability was evidenced by the operation of a 100-h test with steady conversion and product selectivity."

[3] "The difference of selectivity between silicon boride with other boron-containing catalysts maybe resulted from the different subsurface structure"

[4] "To further identify the active sites, the structure evolution of the silicon boride catalyst before and after activation was characterized by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis."

[5] "Upon exposure to the ODH of propane reaction (535C), the surface oxygen concentrations increased to 50.4% after 1h (SiB-1h) and 54.8% after 3h (SiB-3h)"

[6] "The functionalised silicon boride showed high ODH activity for light alkanes; more importantly, the antioxidant ability of silicon boride ensured the catalytic stability."

[7] "To better understand the activation and reaction process, XRD measurement was performed to trace the structure evolution of the silicon boride catalyst under different conditions, including heated to 535C, activated in oxygen or reaction atmosphere and then cooled to room temperature"

[8] "After being subjected to ODH reaction, the catalyst retained the bulk structure of silicon boride (Fig. S1), suggesting that the oxyfunctionalization may only occur on the surface of catalyst."

[9] "Furthermore, a higher binding energy of the B 1s signal located at 193.8eV was detected for SiB-1h and SiB-3h catalysts, which was assigned to the boron oxide (B2O3, Fig. 2 b)."

          The literature primarily focuses on silicon boride (SiB3-6) as a B-based catalyst for oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of light alkanes, rather than providing a comprehensive analysis of B-based materials with 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks. However, some relevant structural characteristics and features that enhance catalytic performance can be inferred:

1. Structural characteristics:
   - Silicon boride is enriched with boron sites, suggesting a dispersion of boron throughout the material.
   - The catalyst retains its bulk structure after ODH reactions, indicating stability.
   - Surface oxyfunctionalization occurs during catalysis, while the bulk structure remains intact.
   - Boron oxide (B2O3) species form on the catalyst surface after activation.

2. Features enhancing catalytic performance:
   - Good oxidation resistance at high temperatures contributes to stability.
   - The antioxidant ability of silicon boride ensures catalytic stability.
   - The material exhibits high ODH activity for light alkanes.
   - Stable performance is demonstrated over a 100-hour test with steady conversion and product selectivity.

3. Methods for incorporating B active components:
   - The study does not explicitly discuss methods for incorporating B active components into 3-D porous frameworks.
   - Silicon boride is used as a starting material, and active sites are formed through activation and reaction processes.
   - Surface oxyfunctionalization occurs during the reaction, creating active boron-oxygen species.

4. Effectiveness for catalytic applications:
   - The silicon boride catalyst shows high activity and stability for ODH of light alkanes.
   - The difference in selectivity between silicon boride and other boron-containing catalysts is attributed to differences in subsurface structure, highlighting the importance of overall material structure in determining catalytic performance.

While these insights provide some understanding of B-based catalysts, the study does not offer a comprehensive analysis of 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks or compare different methods of incorporating B active components for various catalytic applications.

          这篇文献主要关注硅硼化物(SiB3-6)作为轻烷烃氧化脱氢(ODH)反应的B基催化剂，而不是对具有三维分散活性位点的多孔框架B基材料进行全面分析。然而，我们可以从中推断出一些相关的结构特征和增强催化性能的特点：

1. 结构特征：
   - 硅硼化物富含硼位点，表明硼在材料中的分散性。
   - 催化剂在ODH反应后保持其体相结构，显示出稳定性。
   - 催化过程中发生表面氧化官能化，而体相结构保持完整。
   - 活化后，催化剂表面形成三氧化二硼(B2O3)物种。

2. 增强催化性能的特点：
   - 高温下良好的抗氧化性有助于稳定性。
   - 硅硼化物的抗氧化能力确保了催化稳定性。
   - 该材料对轻烷烃表现出高ODH活性。
   - 在100小时的测试中表现出稳定的性能，转化率和产品选择性保持稳定。

3. 引入B活性组分的方法：
   - 该研究没有明确讨论将B活性组分引入三维多孔框架的方法。
   - 硅硼化物被用作起始材料，活性位点通过活化和反应过程形成。
   - 反应过程中发生表面氧化官能化，形成活性硼-氧物种。

4. 对催化应用的有效性：
   - 硅硼化物催化剂对轻烷烃的ODH反应表现出高活性和稳定性。
   - 硅硼化物与其他含硼催化剂之间的选择性差异归因于亚表面结构的不同，突出了整体材料结构在决定催化性能方面的重要性。

虽然这些见解提供了对B基催化剂的一些理解，但该研究并没有对多孔框架中的三维分散活性位点进行全面分析，也没有比较将B活性组分引入不同催化应用的各种方法。
