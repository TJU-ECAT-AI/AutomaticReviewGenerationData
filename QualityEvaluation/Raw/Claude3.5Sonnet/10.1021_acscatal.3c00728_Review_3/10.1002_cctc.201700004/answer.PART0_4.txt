[1] "Boron nitride was first impregnated with 1m sodium nitrite aqueous solution, followed by steam (5vol.% H2O/N2) activation at 530C for 3h; the resulting sample (BNOH) was washed with aqueous ammonia and finally calcined at 500C for 2h in air."

[2] "The BNOH catalyst inherited a hexagonal layered structure of boron nitride (FigureS3). Aberration-corrected transmission electron microscopy (TEM) analyses identified the in-plane lattice retained its hexagonal symmetry with a large number of edges that were newly created during steam activation (Figure2a, FiguresS4 and S5)."

[3] "XPS analysis identified that the surface concentrations of boron and oxygen were 44.3% and 9.2% (Figure2c), respectively. There were two types of boron species (Figure2c); one was coordinated with nitrogen on the flat surface whereas the other was bonded to oxygen at the edge."

[4] "There were two types of boronoxygen bonding at 26.0 and 24.4ppm; the former represents the edge boron sites bonded to two bridging oxygen atoms, and the latter corresponded to BOH bonding, which was identified by the sharp 1H resonance at 1.2ppm in the 1H MAS NMR spectrum (Figure2d, inset)."

The literature does not provide comprehensive information about 3-D dispersed active sites in porous B-based materials. Instead, it focuses on edge-hydroxylated boron nitride, which has a 2-D layered structure. However, we can analyze the structural characteristics and catalytic performance of this material:

1. Structure: The BNOH catalyst maintains a hexagonal layered structure of boron nitride, with newly created edges from steam activation. The active sites are primarily located at these edges.

2. Active sites: The catalyst contains two types of boron-oxygen bonding at the edges: BOB (boron bonded to two bridging oxygen atoms) and BOH (boron hydroxyl groups). These edge sites are the primary active components for catalysis.

3. Incorporation method: The active boron components are incorporated through a multi-step process involving impregnation with sodium nitrite solution, steam activation, washing with aqueous ammonia, and calcination in air. This process creates oxygen-containing functional groups at the edges of the boron nitride structure.

4. Catalytic performance: The edge-hydroxylated boron nitride shows high selectivity and activity for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propylene, with minimal CO2 formation. The BOH groups at the edges selectively activate the C-H bond in propane while suppressing propylene overoxidation.

While this material doesn't feature 3-D dispersed active sites in a porous framework, the incorporation method effectively creates active edge sites that enhance catalytic performance. The steam activation process is particularly crucial in generating these active edge sites. This approach may be effective for reactions requiring selective C-H bond activation, but its applicability to other catalytic processes would need further investigation.

这篇文献并没有提供关于多孔B基材料中3-D分散活性位点的全面信息。相反，它主要关注边缘羟基化的氮化硼，这是一种2-D层状结构。然而，我们可以分析这种材料的结构特征和催化性能：

1. 结构：BNOH催化剂保持了氮化硼的六方层状结构，通过蒸汽活化创造了新的边缘。活性位点主要位于这些边缘处。

2. 活性位点：催化剂在边缘含有两种类型的硼-氧键合：BOB（硼与两个桥接氧原子键合）和BOH（硼羟基）。这些边缘位点是催化的主要活性成分。

3. 引入方法：活性硼组分通过多步骤过程引入，包括浸渍硝酸钠溶液、蒸汽活化、用氨水洗涤和在空气中煅烧。这个过程在氮化硼结构的边缘创造了含氧官能团。

4. 催化性能：边缘羟基化的氮化硼在丙烷氧化脱氢生成丙烯的反应中表现出高选择性和活性，同时CO2生成量最小。边缘的BOH基团选择性地活化丙烷中的C-H键，同时抑制丙烯过度氧化。

虽然这种材料不具有多孔框架中的3-D分散活性位点，但其引入方法有效地创造了增强催化性能的活性边缘位点。蒸汽活化过程在生成这些活性边缘位点方面尤为重要。这种方法可能对需要选择性C-H键活化的反应有效，但其在其他催化过程中的适用性需要进一步研究。
