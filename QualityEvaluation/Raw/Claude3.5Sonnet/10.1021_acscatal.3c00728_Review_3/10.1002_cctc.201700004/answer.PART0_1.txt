[1] "Boron nitride was first impregnated with 1m sodium nitrite aqueous solution, followed by steam (5vol.% H2O/N2) activation at 530C for 3h; the resulting sample (BNOH) was washed with aqueous ammonia and finally calcined at 500C for 2h in air."

[2] "Aberration-corrected transmission electron microscopy (TEM) analyses identified the in-plane lattice retained its hexagonal symmetry with a large number of edges that were newly created during steam activation"

[3] "There were two types of boron species (Figure2c); one was coordinated with nitrogen on the flat surface whereas the other was bonded to oxygen at the edge."

[4] "There were two types of boronoxygen bonding at 26.0 and 24.4ppm; the former represents the edge boron sites bonded to two bridging oxygen atoms, and the latter corresponded to BOH bonding"

[5] "The BOH groups at the edges of boron nitride selectively activate the CH bond in propane and simultaneously suppress the overoxidation of propylene into CO2."

The literature describes a boron nitride-based catalyst with active sites dispersed at the edges, rather than a 3D porous framework structure. However, we can analyze the key structural characteristics and synthesis methods that enhance its catalytic performance:

1. Edge-hydroxylated structure: The boron nitride sheets retain their hexagonal in-plane structure, but have hydroxyl groups (BOH) incorporated at the edges through steam activation. This creates dispersed active sites along the 2D sheet edges.

2. Selective active sites: The BOH groups at the edges selectively activate C-H bonds in propane while suppressing over-oxidation to CO2. This enhances selectivity for the desired propylene product.

3. Synthesis method: The material is prepared by impregnating boron nitride with sodium nitrite solution, followed by steam activation, washing, and calcination. This introduces the key BOH edge sites.

4. Characterization: Advanced techniques like aberration-corrected TEM, XPS, and solid-state NMR were used to confirm the edge structure and bonding of the active sites.

While not a 3D porous framework, this 2D edge-functionalized structure demonstrates how controlled incorporation of boron-based active sites can dramatically improve catalytic selectivity and performance. The steam activation method proved effective for creating the desired edge structure for this oxidative dehydrogenation application.

This approach of edge functionalization could potentially be extended to other 2D materials or adapted to create more 3D porous architectures with dispersed active sites. However, the literature does not directly discuss 3D porous boron-based frameworks or compare different methods of incorporating boron sites into such structures.

这篇文献描述了一种在边缘具有分散活性位点的氮化硼基催化剂，而不是3D多孔框架结构。然而，我们可以分析提高其催化性能的关键结构特征和合成方法：

1. 边缘羟基化结构：氮化硼片保留了其六方面内结构，但通过蒸汽活化在边缘引入了羟基基团（BOH）。这在2D片边缘创造了分散的活性位点。

2. 选择性活性位点：边缘的BOH基团选择性地活化丙烷中的C-H键，同时抑制过度氧化成CO2。这提高了目标产物丙烯的选择性。

3. 合成方法：该材料通过将氮化硼浸渍在亚硝酸钠溶液中，然后进行蒸汽活化、洗涤和煅烧制备而成。这引入了关键的BOH边缘位点。

4. 表征：使用了像球差校正TEM、XPS和固态NMR等先进技术来确认活性位点的边缘结构和键合情况。

虽然不是3D多孔框架，但这种2D边缘功能化结构展示了如何通过控制引入硼基活性位点来显著提高催化选择性和性能。蒸汽活化方法证明对于创建这种氧化脱氢应用所需的边缘结构是有效的。

这种边缘功能化的方法可能会扩展到其他2D材料，或适用于创建具有分散活性位点的更多3D多孔结构。然而，文献并未直接讨论3D多孔硼基框架或比较将硼位点引入此类结构的不同方法。
