[1] "Boron nitride was first impregnated with 1m sodium nitrite aqueous solution, followed by steam (5vol.% H2O/N2) activation at 530C for 3h; the resulting sample (BNOH) was washed with aqueous ammonia and finally calcined at 500C for 2h in air."

[2] "The BNOH catalyst inherited a hexagonal layered structure of boron nitride (FigureS3). Aberration-corrected transmission electron microscopy (TEM) analyses identified the in-plane lattice retained its hexagonal symmetry with a large number of edges that were newly created during steam activation"

[3] "X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis identified that the surface concentrations of boron and oxygen were 44.3% and 9.2% (Figure2c), respectively. There were two types of boron species (Figure2c); one was coordinated with nitrogen on the flat surface whereas the other was bonded to oxygen at the edge."

[4] "There were two types of boronoxygen bonding at 26.0 and 24.4ppm; the former represents the edge boron sites bonded to two bridging oxygen atoms, and the latter corresponded to BOH bonding, which was identified by the sharp 1H resonance at 1.2ppm in the 1H MAS NMR spectrum"

The literature describes the structural characteristics of a boron nitride-based catalyst (BNOH) with active sites dispersed at the edges of its hexagonal layered structure. However, it does not discuss 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks as asked in the question.

The key structural features of BNOH that enhance catalytic performance include:

1. Edge-hydroxylated structure: The boron nitride is activated with steam to create BOH groups at the edges.

2. Hexagonal layered structure: The catalyst retains the hexagonal symmetry of boron nitride, with newly created edges during steam activation.

3. Surface composition: XPS analysis shows 44.3% boron and 9.2% oxygen on the surface, with two types of boron species - one coordinated with nitrogen on the flat surface and another bonded to oxygen at the edge.

4. Boron-oxygen bonding: Two types of B-O bonds are identified through NMR spectroscopy - edge boron sites bonded to two bridging oxygen atoms and BOH bonding.

The method used to incorporate B active components into the structure involves:

1. Impregnation with sodium nitrite solution
2. Steam activation at high temperature
3. Washing with aqueous ammonia
4. Calcination in air

This method appears effective for creating edge-hydroxylated boron nitride for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane, but the literature does not discuss its effectiveness for other catalytic applications or compare it to other methods.

文献描述了一种基于氮化硼的催化剂(BNOH)的结构特征，其活性位点分散在其六方层状结构的边缘。然而，它并没有讨论问题中提到的在多孔框架中3D分散的活性位点。

BNOH提高催化性能的关键结构特征包括：

1. 边缘羟基化结构：氮化硼通过蒸汽活化在边缘生成BOH基团。

2. 六方层状结构：催化剂保留了氮化硼的六方对称性，在蒸汽活化过程中产生了新的边缘。

3. 表面组成：XPS分析显示表面含44.3%的硼和9.2%的氧，有两种类型的硼物种 - 一种与平面上的氮配位，另一种在边缘与氧键合。

4. 硼-氧键合：通过核磁共振波谱鉴定出两种类型的B-O键 - 边缘硼位点与两个桥接氧原子键合，以及BOH键合。

将B活性组分引入结构的方法包括：

1. 用亚硝酸钠溶液浸渍
2. 高温蒸汽活化
3. 用氨水洗涤
4. 空气中煅烧

这种方法似乎对于创建用于丙烷氧化脱氢的边缘羟基化氮化硼是有效的，但文献并未讨论其对其他催化应用的有效性，也没有与其他方法进行比较。
