[1] "Boron nitride was first impregnated with 1m sodium nitrite aqueous solution, followed by steam (5vol.% H2O/N2) activation at 530C for 3h; the resulting sample (BNOH) was washed with aqueous ammonia and finally calcined at 500C for 2h in air."

[2] "Aberration-corrected transmission electron microscopy (TEM) analyses identified the in-plane lattice retained its hexagonal symmetry with a large number of edges that were newly created during steam activation"

[3] "X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis identified that the surface concentrations of boron and oxygen were 44.3% and 9.2% (Figure2c), respectively. There were two types of boron species (Figure2c); one was coordinated with nitrogen on the flat surface whereas the other was bonded to oxygen at the edge."

[4] "There were two types of boronoxygen bonding at 26.0 and 24.4ppm; the former represents the edge boron sites bonded to two bridging oxygen atoms, and the latter corresponded to BOH bonding, which was identified by the sharp 1H resonance at 1.2ppm in the 1H MAS NMR spectrum"

The literature describes the preparation and structural characteristics of an edge-hydroxylated boron nitride (BNOH) catalyst, rather than 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks. However, we can analyze the structural features of this 2-D material and how they enhance catalytic performance:

1. The BNOH catalyst is prepared by steam activation of boron nitride, creating edge sites with hydroxyl groups.

2. The material retains a hexagonal lattice structure with newly created edges during activation.

3. Active sites are primarily located at the edges, where boron is bonded to oxygen, either as B-O-B bridges or B-OH groups.

4. The surface contains 44.3% boron and 9.2% oxygen, indicating a significant presence of oxygen-containing active sites.

5. Two types of boron-oxygen bonding are identified: edge boron sites bonded to two bridging oxygen atoms and B-OH groups.

These structural features enhance catalytic performance by:

1. Providing accessible active sites at the edges of the 2-D structure.
2. Creating a high concentration of oxygen-containing functional groups (B-O-B and B-OH) that serve as active sites.
3. Maintaining the hexagonal lattice structure, which likely contributes to the material's stability.

The method used to incorporate B active components involves steam activation of boron nitride, followed by washing and calcination. This approach appears effective for creating edge-functionalized 2-D materials with active sites for oxidative dehydrogenation reactions. However, the effectiveness of this method for other catalytic applications or for creating 3-D porous frameworks is not discussed in the given literature.

该文献描述了边缘羟基化氮化硼(BNOH)催化剂的制备和结构特征，而不是三维多孔框架中分散的活性位点。然而，我们可以分析这种二维材料的结构特征及其如何提高催化性能：

1. BNOH催化剂是通过氮化硼的蒸汽活化制备的，在边缘创造了含羟基的活性位点。

2. 该材料在活化过程中保持六方晶格结构，并创造了新的边缘。

3. 活性位点主要位于边缘，其中硼与氧结合，形成B-O-B桥或B-OH基团。

4. 表面含有44.3%的硼和9.2%的氧，表明存在大量含氧活性位点。

5. 鉴定出两种硼-氧键合类型：与两个桥接氧原子结合的边缘硼位点和B-OH基团。

这些结构特征通过以下方式提高催化性能：

1. 在二维结构的边缘提供可接触的活性位点。
2. 创造高浓度的含氧官能团（B-O-B和B-OH），作为活性位点。
3. 保持六方晶格结构，可能有助于材料的稳定性。

用于引入B活性组分的方法包括氮化硼的蒸汽活化，随后进行洗涤和煅烧。这种方法似乎对于创造具有氧化脱氢反应活性位点的边缘功能化二维材料是有效的。然而，该文献并未讨论这种方法对其他催化应用或创造三维多孔框架的有效性。
