[1] "Here we report edge-hydroxylated boron nitride, a metal-free catalyst, that efficiently catalyzed dehydrogenation of propane to propylene with superior selectivity (80.2%) but with only negligible CO2 formation (0.5%) at a given propane conversion of 20.6%."

[2] "Aberration-corrected transmission electron microscopy (TEM) analyses identified the in-plane lattice retained its hexagonal symmetry with a large number of edges that were newly created during steam activation"

[3] "Boron K-edge electron energy-loss spectroscopy (EELS) analysis with a high-angle annular dark-field (HAADF) STEM mode (Figure2b and FigureS8) showed that the edge possesses a higher π* to σ* ratio (1.27, point2) than that (0.52, point4) of the in-plane, primarily because of the local warp or wrinkle at the edge"

[4] "There were two types of boron species (Figure2c); one was coordinated with nitrogen on the flat surface whereas the other was bonded to oxygen at the edge."

[5] "FTIR analysis was performed to identify the roles of the BOB and BOH groups under the reaction conditions. The characteristic band of hydroxyl stretching vibration was clearly observed at approximately 3400cm1 (Figure3a)."

The literature does not directly discuss 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks for B-based materials. Instead, it focuses on edge-hydroxylated boron nitride, which is a 2-D material. However, we can analyze some relevant structural characteristics and their impact on catalytic performance:

1. Edge-hydroxylated boron nitride has active sites (BOH groups) concentrated at the edges of its 2-D structure, rather than dispersed in a 3-D framework.

2. The hexagonal lattice structure of boron nitride is maintained, with new edges created during steam activation. This increases the number of potential active sites.

3. The edges of the boron nitride sheets show local warping or wrinkling, which affects the electronic structure and reactivity of the edge sites.

4. Two types of boron species are present: one coordinated with nitrogen on the flat surface, and another bonded to oxygen at the edges. This creates distinct active sites for catalysis.

5. The BOH groups at the edges play a crucial role in the catalytic process, as evidenced by FTIR analysis.

The method used to incorporate B active components in this case is steam activation, which creates hydroxylated edges on the boron nitride sheets. This method is effective for creating active sites for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane, resulting in high selectivity and low CO2 formation.

While this approach is effective for the specific catalytic application described (propane dehydrogenation), it may not be directly applicable to other catalytic systems requiring 3-D dispersed active sites. The effectiveness of this method is limited to 2-D materials and edge-based catalysis.

To fully address the question about 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks, additional research on different B-based materials and incorporation methods would be necessary.

这篇文献并没有直接讨论B基材料在多孔框架中的3-D分散活性位点。相反，它聚焦于边缘羟基化的氮化硼，这是一种2-D材料。然而，我们可以分析一些相关的结构特征及其对催化性能的影响：

1. 边缘羟基化的氮化硼的活性位点（BOH基团）集中在其2-D结构的边缘，而不是分散在3-D框架中。

2. 氮化硼的六方晶格结构得以保持，在蒸汽活化过程中创造了新的边缘。这增加了潜在活性位点的数量。

3. 氮化硼片的边缘显示局部弯曲或褶皱，这影响了边缘位点的电子结构和反应活性。

4. 存在两种类型的硼物种：一种与平面表面的氮配位，另一种在边缘与氧键合。这创造了独特的催化活性位点。

5. FTIR分析证实，边缘的BOH基团在催化过程中起着关键作用。

在这种情况下，用于引入B活性组分的方法是蒸汽活化，它在氮化硼片上创造了羟基化边缘。这种方法有效地创造了丙烷氧化脱氢的活性位点，resulting in高选择性和低CO2生成。

虽然这种方法对所描述的特定催化应用（丙烷脱氢）是有效的，但它可能不直接适用于需要3-D分散活性位点的其他催化系统。这种方法的有效性仅限于2-D材料和基于边缘的催化。

要全面回答关于多孔框架中3-D分散活性位点的问题，需要对不同的B基材料和引入方法进行额外的研究。

The literature describes a boron nitride-based catalyst with active sites dispersed at the edges, rather than a 3D porous framework structure. However, we can analyze the key structural characteristics and synthesis methods that enhance its catalytic performance:

1. Edge-hydroxylated structure: The boron nitride sheets retain their hexagonal in-plane structure, but have hydroxyl groups (BOH) incorporated at the edges through steam activation. This creates dispersed active sites along the 2D sheet edges.

2. Selective active sites: The BOH groups at the edges selectively activate C-H bonds in propane while suppressing over-oxidation to CO2. This enhances selectivity for the desired propylene product.

3. Synthesis method: The material is prepared by impregnating boron nitride with sodium nitrite solution, followed by steam activation, washing, and calcination. This introduces the key BOH edge sites.

4. Characterization: Advanced techniques like aberration-corrected TEM, XPS, and solid-state NMR were used to confirm the edge structure and bonding of the active sites.

While not a 3D porous framework, this 2D edge-functionalized structure demonstrates how controlled incorporation of boron-based active sites can dramatically improve catalytic selectivity and performance. The steam activation method proved effective for creating the desired edge structure for this oxidative dehydrogenation application.

This approach of edge functionalization could potentially be extended to other 2D materials or adapted to create more 3D porous architectures with dispersed active sites. However, the literature does not directly discuss 3D porous boron-based frameworks or compare different methods of incorporating boron sites into such structures.

这篇文献描述了一种在边缘具有分散活性位点的氮化硼基催化剂，而不是3D多孔框架结构。然而，我们可以分析提高其催化性能的关键结构特征和合成方法：

1. 边缘羟基化结构：氮化硼片保留了其六方面内结构，但通过蒸汽活化在边缘引入了羟基基团（BOH）。这在2D片边缘创造了分散的活性位点。

2. 选择性活性位点：边缘的BOH基团选择性地活化丙烷中的C-H键，同时抑制过度氧化成CO2。这提高了目标产物丙烯的选择性。

3. 合成方法：该材料通过将氮化硼浸渍在亚硝酸钠溶液中，然后进行蒸汽活化、洗涤和煅烧制备而成。这引入了关键的BOH边缘位点。

4. 表征：使用了像球差校正TEM、XPS和固态NMR等先进技术来确认活性位点的边缘结构和键合情况。

虽然不是3D多孔框架，但这种2D边缘功能化结构展示了如何通过控制引入硼基活性位点来显著提高催化选择性和性能。蒸汽活化方法证明对于创建这种氧化脱氢应用所需的边缘结构是有效的。

这种边缘功能化的方法可能会扩展到其他2D材料，或适用于创建具有分散活性位点的更多3D多孔结构。然而，文献并未直接讨论3D多孔硼基框架或比较将硼位点引入此类结构的不同方法。

The literature describes the preparation and structural characteristics of an edge-hydroxylated boron nitride (BNOH) catalyst, rather than 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks. However, we can analyze the structural features of this 2-D material and how they enhance catalytic performance:

1. The BNOH catalyst is prepared by steam activation of boron nitride, creating edge sites with hydroxyl groups.

2. The material retains a hexagonal lattice structure with newly created edges during activation.

3. Active sites are primarily located at the edges, where boron is bonded to oxygen, either as B-O-B bridges or B-OH groups.

4. The surface contains 44.3% boron and 9.2% oxygen, indicating a significant presence of oxygen-containing active sites.

5. Two types of boron-oxygen bonding are identified: edge boron sites bonded to two bridging oxygen atoms and B-OH groups.

These structural features enhance catalytic performance by:

1. Providing accessible active sites at the edges of the 2-D structure.
2. Creating a high concentration of oxygen-containing functional groups (B-O-B and B-OH) that serve as active sites.
3. Maintaining the hexagonal lattice structure, which likely contributes to the material's stability.

The method used to incorporate B active components involves steam activation of boron nitride, followed by washing and calcination. This approach appears effective for creating edge-functionalized 2-D materials with active sites for oxidative dehydrogenation reactions. However, the effectiveness of this method for other catalytic applications or for creating 3-D porous frameworks is not discussed in the given literature.

该文献描述了边缘羟基化氮化硼(BNOH)催化剂的制备和结构特征，而不是三维多孔框架中分散的活性位点。然而，我们可以分析这种二维材料的结构特征及其如何提高催化性能：

1. BNOH催化剂是通过氮化硼的蒸汽活化制备的，在边缘创造了含羟基的活性位点。

2. 该材料在活化过程中保持六方晶格结构，并创造了新的边缘。

3. 活性位点主要位于边缘，其中硼与氧结合，形成B-O-B桥或B-OH基团。

5. 鉴定出两种硼-氧键合类型：与两个桥接氧原子结合的边缘硼位点和B-OH基团。

这些结构特征通过以下方式提高催化性能：

3. 保持六方晶格结构，可能有助于材料的稳定性。

用于引入B活性组分的方法包括氮化硼的蒸汽活化，随后进行洗涤和煅烧。这种方法似乎对于创造具有氧化脱氢反应活性位点的边缘功能化二维材料是有效的。然而，该文献并未讨论这种方法对其他催化应用或创造三维多孔框架的有效性。

The literature describes the structural characteristics of a boron nitride-based catalyst (BNOH) with active sites dispersed at the edges of its hexagonal layered structure. However, it does not discuss 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks as asked in the question.

The key structural features of BNOH that enhance catalytic performance include:

1. Edge-hydroxylated structure: The boron nitride is activated with steam to create BOH groups at the edges.

2. Hexagonal layered structure: The catalyst retains the hexagonal symmetry of boron nitride, with newly created edges during steam activation.

3. Surface composition: XPS analysis shows 44.3% boron and 9.2% oxygen on the surface, with two types of boron species - one coordinated with nitrogen on the flat surface and another bonded to oxygen at the edge.

4. Boron-oxygen bonding: Two types of B-O bonds are identified through NMR spectroscopy - edge boron sites bonded to two bridging oxygen atoms and BOH bonding.

The method used to incorporate B active components into the structure involves:

1. Impregnation with sodium nitrite solution
2. Steam activation at high temperature
3. Washing with aqueous ammonia
4. Calcination in air

This method appears effective for creating edge-hydroxylated boron nitride for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane, but the literature does not discuss its effectiveness for other catalytic applications or compare it to other methods.

The literature does not provide comprehensive information about 3-D dispersed active sites in porous B-based materials. Instead, it focuses on edge-hydroxylated boron nitride, which has a 2-D layered structure. However, we can analyze the structural characteristics and catalytic performance of this material:

1. Structure: The BNOH catalyst maintains a hexagonal layered structure of boron nitride, with newly created edges from steam activation. The active sites are primarily located at these edges.

2. Active sites: The catalyst contains two types of boron-oxygen bonding at the edges: BOB (boron bonded to two bridging oxygen atoms) and BOH (boron hydroxyl groups). These edge sites are the primary active components for catalysis.

3. Incorporation method: The active boron components are incorporated through a multi-step process involving impregnation with sodium nitrite solution, steam activation, washing with aqueous ammonia, and calcination in air. This process creates oxygen-containing functional groups at the edges of the boron nitride structure.

4. Catalytic performance: The edge-hydroxylated boron nitride shows high selectivity and activity for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propylene, with minimal CO2 formation. The BOH groups at the edges selectively activate the C-H bond in propane while suppressing propylene overoxidation.

While this material doesn't feature 3-D dispersed active sites in a porous framework, the incorporation method effectively creates active edge sites that enhance catalytic performance. The steam activation process is particularly crucial in generating these active edge sites. This approach may be effective for reactions requiring selective C-H bond activation, but its applicability to other catalytic processes would need further investigation.
