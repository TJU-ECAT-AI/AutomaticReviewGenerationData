Edge-hydroxylated Boron Nitride for Oxidative Dehydrogenation of Propane to Propylene
Graphical Abstract
Olefin generation without a metal: Edge-hydroxylated boron nitride shows superior selectivity for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propylene with only negligible CO2 formation. The dynamically generated active BNO. site triggers propane dehydrogenation by selectively breaking the CH bond by concomitantly avoiding propylene oxidation to CO2.
Abstract
Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to olefins is a promising alternative route to industrialized direct dehydrogenation, but encounters the difficulty in selectivity control for olefins because of the overoxidation reactions that produce a substantial amount of undesired CO2. Here we report edge-hydroxylated boron nitride, a metal-free catalyst, that efficiently catalyzed dehydrogenation of propane to propylene with superior selectivity (80.2%) but with only negligible CO2 formation (0.5%) at a given propane conversion of 20.6%. Remarkable stability was evidenced by the operation of a 300h test with steady conversion and product selectivity. The active BNO. site, generated dynamically through hydrogen abstraction of BOH groups by molecular oxygen, triggered propane dehydrogenation by selectively breaking the CH bond but simultaneously shut off the pathway of propylene overoxidation towards CO2.
Introduction
Propylene, which is one of the most important light olefins in the petrochemical industry, is currently produced mainly by catalytic cracking of petroleum-derived hydrocarbons or multistage coal-based methanol-to-olefins processes, both involving extensive energy consumption and significant emission of CO2.1 Direct catalytic dehydrogenation of propane to propylene has been developed as a more economical and environmentally friendly route and has been commercialized by UOP and ABB Lummus in the 1990s, using Pt- and CrOx-based catalysts, respectively.2 However, this process practically suffered from thermodynamic limitations in further prompting the reaction efficiency and also rapid catalyst deactivation by coking and catalyst sintering that required a frequent regeneration of the catalysts under harsh conditions.3
Oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of propane, catalyzed by transition-metal oxides and alkaline-earth metal oxychlorides,4 offers an attractive alternative route with the prominent characters of free coking and no equilibrium limitation in propane conversion, but the selectivity toward propylene is often lower than in the direct dehydrogenation route, primarily because of overoxidation of the formed propylene to CO2 (1060%).5 Under the reaction conditions, the formed electron-rich propylene reacted more easily with molecular oxygen over the metal oxide catalysts, resulting in the cleavage of the CC bond through consecutive oxygen insertion and thus forming the final product, CO2. From a chemical point of view, an ideal catalyst should be highly selective for CH bond cleavage but not for CC bond cleavage under the oxidative dehydrogenation conditions. Unfortunately, the development of such a highly selective catalyst is still challenging.
Recently, Hermans's group reported that boron nitride exhibits a high selectivity to propylene (79%) and ethylene (12%) at 14% conversion in the ODH reaction of propane.6 Nevertheless, in view of activity, selectivity, and stability, there is still room for improvements, and a detailed structural characterization of this novel catalytic system and a better understanding of the structureactivity correlation in the ODH reaction of propane are still needed. As reported herein our group found that boron nitride, after steam hydroxylation at the edges, can efficiently catalyze the ODH of propane. We show that edge-hydroxylated boron nitride offers high selectivity toward propylene (up to 80.2%) at higher propane conversion (20.6%). At a 6.5% conversion level of propane, it offers a surprising propylene selectivity as high as 97.4%. As we aimed at understanding the catalytic origin of boron nitride in the ODH reaction of propane, we could show that the BOH groups at the edges of boron nitride selectively activate the CH bond in propane and simultaneously suppress the overoxidation of propylene into CO2.
Results and Discussion
Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane
Boron nitride was first impregnated with 1m sodium nitrite aqueous solution, followed by steam (5vol.% H2O/N2) activation at 530C for 3h; the resulting sample (BNOH) was washed with aqueous ammonia and finally calcined at 500C for 2h in air. The BNOH catalyst provided surprisingly high selectivity toward propylene during ODH of propane at 530C. The conversion of propane approached 20.6%, which is equivalent to a reaction rate of 7.74g gcat1h1; the product slate consisted of propylene, ethylene, methane, CO, and CO2. In particular, the selectivity was 80.2% for propylene and only 0.5% for CO2 (Figure1a). Taking the equally important product ethylene into account, the selectivity for light olefins (ethylene+propylene, C23=) was up to 90.9%, which was much higher than the selectivities obtained over the well-developed metal or metal oxide catalysts at a comparable propane conversion level, as well as over carbon and carbonaceous materials.4b, 5e, 5f, 7 More significantly, the formation of CO2 (0.5%) was considerably lower than for the traditional ODH processes (1060% CO2),5 demonstrating the excellent performance of the current BNOH catalyst in the selective activation of the CH bond in propane.

Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane over the BNOH catalyst. a)Propane conversion and product selectivity, b)long-term stability test. Reaction conditions: temperature, 530C; catalyst weight, 100mg; gas feed, 16.7vol.% C3H8, 25.1vol% O2, and He balance; space velocity, 37.6g gcat1h1.
A control experiment with a feed gas of C3H6/O2/He showed no measurable conversion of propylene (Supporting Information, FigureS1), evidencing that the BNOH catalyst does not activate the CC bond of propylene and thus avoids its overoxidation under ODH conditions. The remarkable stability of the BNOH catalyst in the ODH of propane was evidenced by the operation of a 300h test at 530C, in which no significant variations in the conversion and product selectivity occurred (Figure1b), demonstrating the potential for industrial application. Moreover, the selectivity toward propylene can be further promoted by mediating the reaction conditions. For example, propylene selectivity of 97.4% (C23=: 99.1%) was obtained at 510C at a propane conversion level of 6.5%; whereas it approached 59.8% (C23=: 76.3%) at 540C with a propane conversion level of 38.2% (FigureS2).
Structural characterization of the BNOH catalyst
To verify the origin of the unique selectivity of the BNOH catalyst, detailed structural analyses were conducted. The BNOH catalyst inherited a hexagonal layered structure of boron nitride (FigureS3). Aberration-corrected transmission electron microscopy (TEM) analyses identified the in-plane lattice retained its hexagonal symmetry with a large number of edges that were newly created during steam activation (Figure2a, FiguresS4 and S5). TEM images viewed along the [001] direction (Figure2a and FigureS6) revealed that the most frequently exposed lateral termination facets were {10 0}, {01 0}, and {1 00}, suggesting that the terminated configuration had zigzag edges.8 Lattice relaxations and distortions occurred exclusively at the edge of the layer (Figure2a and FigureS7).

Boron K-edge electron energy-loss spectroscopy (EELS) analysis with a high-angle annular dark-field (HAADF) STEM mode (Figure2b and FigureS8) showed that the edge possesses a higher π* to σ* ratio (1.27, point2) than that (0.52, point4) of the in-plane, primarily because of the local warp or wrinkle at the edge,9 and the B/N ratio (1.28, point2) at the edge was higher than that (0.95, point4) of the in-plane (Figure2b). X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis identified that the surface concentrations of boron and oxygen were 44.3% and 9.2% (Figure2c), respectively. There were two types of boron species (Figure2c); one was coordinated with nitrogen on the flat surface whereas the other was bonded to oxygen at the edge.10 The chemical environment for the coordination between boron and oxygen was further verified by the 2D 11B multiple quantum (MQ) magic-angle spinning (MAS) NMR spectrum of the BNOH catalyst (Figure2d). There were two types of boronoxygen bonding at 26.0 and 24.4ppm; the former represents the edge boron sites bonded to two bridging oxygen atoms, and the latter corresponded to BOH bonding, which was identified by the sharp 1H resonance at 1.2ppm in the 1H MAS NMR spectrum (Figure2d, inset).
Identification of active sites of the BNOH catalyst
FTIR analysis was performed to identify the roles of the BOB and BOH groups under the reaction conditions. The characteristic band of hydroxyl stretching vibration was clearly observed at approximately 3400cm1 (Figure3a).11 Upon exposure to C3H8 atmosphere at 530C, the band position of the hydroxyl stretches remained unchanged, and no propane conversion was detected (Figure3a). With the addition of molecular oxygen (O2/C3H8/He), however, the absorption of hydroxyl vibrational stretches gradually weakened (Figure3a), accompanied with the formation of propylene, indicating that the OH groups interacted with molecular oxygen and incorporated into the reaction network. The intensities of hydroxyl vibrational stretches were fully recovered upon steam activation (Figure3a and FigureS9), suggesting that the OH groups could be readily regenerated.

Isotopic measurements further confirmed the catalytic role of the BOH groups. If C3H8 and O2 were pulsed into the deuterated BNOH(D) catalyst at 530C, both HDO and D2O were formed immediately, and their amounts gradually decreased during subsequent pulses (Figure3b and FigureS10). This indicated that the H/D atoms in the BNOH(D) catalyst were abstracted during the reaction process. The neighboring oxygen atoms were also involved in the reaction process. If the BNOH catalyst was exposed to a mixture of 18O2 and C3H8 (Figure3c), both H216O and H218O were produced, suggesting that the 16O atom in the BOH groups participated in the formation of the H216O molecule. During subsequent pulses, the amount of H218O continuously increased while the amount of H216O decreased, further verifying the isotopic exchange between 16O sites at the BNOH edge and gaseous 18O2.
DFT calculations demonstrated that two adjacent BOH groups could dehydrate through the transition state with a four-membered ring, leading to the formation of BOB bridges. Reversibly, the gaseous H2O could insert into the BOB bridges to recover the two adjacent BOH groups. The freshly formed H218O during the ODH will participate in the reversible breakage of the BOB bridges, through which the exchange between the gaseous 18O and the 16O at the BNOH edge site will be fulfilled, and the edge BOH sites can remain at their active state (FigureS11).
Kinetic behavior of propane ODH over the BNOH catalyst
The kinetic characters of the ODH reaction of propane over the BNOH catalyst nicely supported the conclusion from insitu FTIR and isotope-labeling experiments. Initially, the apparent activation energies (Ea) of two reactants, propane and oxygen, were obtained by evaluating the dependence of their converting rates on the reaction temperature. It was found that the Ea of propane conversion was 184kJmol1, lower than that (250kJmol1) reported by Hermans's group.6 In the current study, the Ea (213kJmol1) of oxygen activation was estimated to be higher than that of propane conversion (Figure4a). This means that the cleavage of CH bonds readily happens after oxygen activation in the BNOH catalytic system for the ODH of propane.

Reaction rates of propane and oxygen were measured in the range of 500535C with a feed gas of 16.7vol% C3H8/25.1vol% O2/He at the space velocity of 75.2gC3H8gcat1h1. b)Reaction rates of C3H8, CH3CD2CH3, and C3D8 as function of reaction time in ODH of propane. Reaction rates were measured at 530C with a feed gas of 16.7vol% C3H8 or CH3CD2CH3 or C3D8/25.1vol%O2/He at the space velocity of 75.2gC3H8gcat1h1. c) and d)Effect of partial pressure of propane and oxygen on propane conversion in the ODH reaction over the BNOH catalyst. Reaction conditions: catalyst weight, 100mg; gas feed, 025.2 vol % C3H8, 025.2vol% O2, and He balance; reaction temperature, 530C; space velocity, 75.2gC3H8gcat1h1; 0.1MPa.
This deduction was further verified by measuring the kinetic isotope effects (KIEs) of CH cleavage. The low KIEs for primary hydrogen abstraction (k1,CH/k1,CD=1.4 using C3H8 and CH3CD2CH3 as reactants) and secondary hydrogen abstraction (k2,CH/k2,CD=1.5 using CH3CD2CH3 and C3D8 as reactants) also indicated that the cleavage of CH bonds readily happened in our BNOH catalytic system for propane ODH (Figure4b), supporting the deduction from activation energy measurements.
Moreover, the effect of reactant concentrations on the reaction rate was measured to investigate the kinetic behaviors (Figure4c and Figure4d). A Langmuir-type dependence on oxygen concentration corresponds with a reaction mechanism that is controlled by adsorption or activation of molecular oxygen on the catalyst surface. Second-order dependence on propane concentration suggested that the propane reacted directly from the gas phase with the active oxygen species on the surface of the BNOH catalyst.12
Conclusions
We have demonstrated that boron nitride, upon steam activation to generate BOH groups at the edges, efficiently catalyzes the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane with a superior selectivity toward propylene and a significantly minimized CO2 emission. Hydrogen abstraction of BOH groups by molecular oxygen dynamically generates the active sites, which triggers propane dehydrogenation. This novel and metal-free catalyst system not only opens up a new research direction in the selective activation of the CH bond of alkanes, but also serves as a highly potential catalyst for the industrial ODH process.
Experimental Section
Catalyst preparation
Pristine boron nitride was synthesized by using a high-temperature solid-phase reaction employing boric acid (H3BO3) and melamine (C3H6N6) together with urea (CO(NH2)2) as the boron and nitrogen sources, respectively. The typical synthesis procedure was as follows: H3BO3 (1.856g) and C3H6N6 (0.755g) were dissolved in methanol (10mL), and then CO(NH2)2 (0.269g) was added into the solution. Subsequently, the methanol was completely evaporated at 25C under vigorous stirring conditions. The resulting solid was heated to 1500C and maintained at that temperature for 1h in a graphite boat (total length, 55mm; width, 22mm; height, 22mm) in a quartz-tube furnace under N2 flow of 80mLmin1. The product was washed by using deionized water of 90C for three times and filtered to remove excess boron oxide. The white boron nitride had a specific surface area of 32m2g1 and a pore volume of 0.23cm3g1.
The as-prepared boron nitride was hydroxylated by a sodiumassisted high-temperature steam activation process.13 A typical procedure was as follows: sodium nitrite solution (200μL, 1molL1) was initially impregnated in boron nitride powder (1.0g) and then maintained at 50C for 6 h, followed by calcination in air at 560C for 1h. After air cooling to room temperature, the solid product was transferred to a fixed-bed reactor and then treated with 5vol.% H2O/N2 at 530C for 3h. Sodium ions were further leached out at reflux in 3molL1 ammonia at 80C for 3times, followed by extensive washing with ultrapure water (40times, 50mL water each). The obtained powders were treated in air at 500C for 2h with a heating rate of 10Cmin1, and the resultant sample was denoted as BNOH. The inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy (ICPOES) measurement showed that the residual content of sodium was 0.18wt.%.
Catalytic evaluation
Catalytic reactions were performed in a packed-bed quartz microreactor (I.D.=6mm). Prior to testing, the catalyst was heated to 560C at a rate of 10Cmin1 in 20vol.% O2/N2 and maintained at this temperature for 1h. The reaction mixture was C3H8/O2/He with a molar ratio of 1/1.5/3.5 at atmospheric pressure. The flow rate was fixed at 192mLmin1, and the reaction temperature was varied in the range of 500550C. Reactants and products were analyzed by an online gas chromatograph (Techcomp, GC 7900). A GDX-102 and 5A molecular sieve column, connected to a TCD were used to analyze the O2, He, C3H8, C3H6, C2H4, CH4, CO, and CO2.
Conversion was defined as the number of moles of carbon converted divided by the number of moles of carbon present in the feed. Selectivity was defined as the number of moles of carbon in the product divided by the number of moles of carbon reacted. The carbon balance was checked by comparing the number of moles of carbon in the outlet stream to the number of moles of carbon in the feed. Under our typical evaluating conditions, the carbon balance was within 3%. To account for the volume expansion in the reaction, helium was used as the internal standard.
In kinetic analysis, reaction rates were measured in a packed-bed single-pass flow microreactor with plug-flow hydrodynamics. Experimental data of propane and oxygen conversion at different temperature levels were used to obtain the apparent activation energy. Reaction orders of propane and oxygen were obtained by measuring the effect of reactant partial pressure on reaction rates. Catalytic reaction was supposed to proceed under net kinetic control.
Catalyst characterization
Powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) measurements were performed on a Rigaku D/Max 2400 diffractometer using CuKα radiation (λ=0.15406nm). The powder catalyst was placed inside a quartz-glass sample holder prior to testing. Rietveld refinements of PXRD pattern were conducted with GSAS program.
HRTEM images were recorded on an aberration-corrected and monochromated FEI Titan ETEM 80300 microscope. The microscope was operated at an accelerating voltage of 80kV to limit structural damage to the sample. HAADFSTEM images and EELS were taken on an aberration-corrected Nion Ultra STEM 100 at 100kV equipped with a Gatan Enfinium Spectrometer. The specimen was prepared by ultrasonically dispersing the powder sample in ethanol and droplets of the suspension were deposited onto a carbon-coated copper grid.
Solid-state MAS NMR spectra were recorded on an Agilent DD2-500MHz spectrometer. 11B and 1H MAS NMR experiments were performed at 160.3MHz and 499.8MHz, respectively, using a 4-mm MAS NMR probe with a spinning rate of 10kHz. 1H MAS NMR spectra were accumulated for 32scans with a 5s recycle delay. The chemical shifts were referenced to tetramethylsilane (TMS). 2D 11B multiple-quantum (MQ) MAS NMR experiments were performed using a three-pulse sequence incorporating a z-filter at a spinning speed of 10kHz. A two-dimensional Fourier transformation followed by a shearing transformation gave a pure absorption mode 2D contour plot. The chemical shifts were referenced to a 1m H3BO3 aqueous solution at 19.6ppm. Prior to testing, the sample was dehydrated at 400C for 1h at 104Pa and then transferred to a 4-mm MAS rotor in a home-made device without exposure to air.
XPS analysis was performed on an Omicron Sphera II hemispherical electron energy analyzer with an insitu reaction cell attached to the instrument. Monochromatic ALK X-ray source (1486.6eV, anode operating at 15kV and 300W) was used as incident radiation. The binding energy of the element was calibrated using an N1s photoelectron peak at 398.1eV.10, 14 Before the measurements, all the samples were treated insitu at 500C for 1h under an Ar stream (32mLmin1) and then moved to the measured chamber under vacuum conditions.
ICPOES measurements were conducted to monitor the sodium content in the hydroxylation process. The samples were dissolved in a mixture of HNO3 and HF under microwave-assisted heating conditions. Nitrogen adsorptiondesorption isotherms were measured with a Micromeritics TriStar 3000 adsorption analyzer. Before the measurements, the sample was degassed at 200C for 4h. The specific surface area was calculated from the adsorption data in the relative pressure range from 0.05 to 0.3 using the BET method.
Insitu infrared spectroscopy
Insitu FTIR spectra were recorded under reaction condition on a Nicolet 6700 FTIR spectrometer equipped with mercury cadmium telluride (MCT) detector. The BNOH catalyst of 25mg was compressed as a thin disk (Φ=1.2cm), and placed in a quartz transmission cell equipped with CaF2 windows and a thermocouple mount that allowed direct measurement of the surface temperature. Spectra were averaged over 512scans in the range 4004000cm1 with a 2cm1 resolution. Prior to collecting spectra, the catalysts were pretreated for 1h at 530C in helium (40mLmin1). The gas composition at the reactor outlet during insitu FTIR experiments was controlled by online mass spectrometry (MS, Pfeiffer, OminStarTM). The propane and oxygen conversions were calculated from the inlet and outlet concentration of these components. The following mass-to-charge (m/z) signals were analyzed: 29 (C3H8), 32 (O2), 41 (C3H6, C3H8), 44 (C3H8, CO2), and 18 (H2O). A rehydroxylation of the used catalysts was made with a 4vol.% H2O/He stream.
Isotope-labeling experiments
Isotopic tracer experiments were performed in a packed-bed single-pass flow microreactor. The chemical and isotopic compositions of the reactor effluent were measured by online mass spectrometry (MS, Pfeiffer, OminStarTM) at 10s intervals. In the deuterium-labeling studies, the BNOH catalyst was initially treated at 530C under helium (40mLmin1) for 1h, and then a 6h H/D exchange process on the BNOH surface was accomplished by passing a He feed (28mLmin1) through a water saturator held at 25C by a thermostat to produce a 3.5vol.% D2O/He feed. Heavy water (D2O, Cambridge Isotope Lab., 99.9%) was not further purified. Subsequently, the deuterated BNOH catalyst was purged with the dry helium (32mLmin1) for 3h to remove the excess D2O. C3H8, O2, or a mixture of the two (800μL each time) was then directly pulsed into the deuterated BNOH catalyst using helium (32mLmin1) as the carrier gas. The products were analyzed by a mass spectrometer with the following mass-to-charge (m/z) signals: 29 for C3H8, 41 for C3H6, 32 for O2, 18 for H2O, 19 for HDO, and 20 for D2O.
Before the 18O-labeling experiments, the BNOH catalyst was treated at 530C under helium (40mLmin1) for 1h and then the mixture of C3H8 and 18O2 (800μL each time) was pulsed into the BNOH catalyst using helium (40mLmin1) as the carrier gas. The products were analyzed by a mass spectrometer with the following m/z signals: 29 for C3H8, 41 for C3H6 and C3H8, 36 for 18O2, 18 for H216O, and 20 H218O. Propane (C3H8, research grade, 99.99%), oxygen (16O2, research grade, 99.99%), and isotopic oxygen (18O2, Cambridge Isotope Lab., 99%) were used as reactants without further purification.
DFT calculations
All stationary points were fully optimized using the B3LYP hybrid exchangecorrelation functional15 as implemented in Gaussian09 program with all atoms described by a double ξ quality basis set, 6-31G(d, p),16 followed by vibrational frequency analysis to identify the stationary points, either as minima or transition states. Intrinsic reaction coordinate (IRC) calculations17 were performed to confirm that each transition state connects the two minima along the reaction pathway.
