[1] "Here we report edge-hydroxylated boron nitride, a metal-free catalyst, that efficiently catalyzed dehydrogenation of propane to propylene with superior selectivity (80.2%) but with only negligible CO2 formation (0.5%) at a given propane conversion of 20.6%."

[2] "Aberration-corrected transmission electron microscopy (TEM) analyses identified the in-plane lattice retained its hexagonal symmetry with a large number of edges that were newly created during steam activation"

[3] "Boron K-edge electron energy-loss spectroscopy (EELS) analysis with a high-angle annular dark-field (HAADF) STEM mode (Figure2b and FigureS8) showed that the edge possesses a higher π* to σ* ratio (1.27, point2) than that (0.52, point4) of the in-plane, primarily because of the local warp or wrinkle at the edge"

[4] "There were two types of boron species (Figure2c); one was coordinated with nitrogen on the flat surface whereas the other was bonded to oxygen at the edge."

[5] "FTIR analysis was performed to identify the roles of the BOB and BOH groups under the reaction conditions. The characteristic band of hydroxyl stretching vibration was clearly observed at approximately 3400cm1 (Figure3a)."

The literature does not directly discuss 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks for B-based materials. Instead, it focuses on edge-hydroxylated boron nitride, which is a 2-D material. However, we can analyze some relevant structural characteristics and their impact on catalytic performance:

1. Edge-hydroxylated boron nitride has active sites (BOH groups) concentrated at the edges of its 2-D structure, rather than dispersed in a 3-D framework.

2. The hexagonal lattice structure of boron nitride is maintained, with new edges created during steam activation. This increases the number of potential active sites.

3. The edges of the boron nitride sheets show local warping or wrinkling, which affects the electronic structure and reactivity of the edge sites.

4. Two types of boron species are present: one coordinated with nitrogen on the flat surface, and another bonded to oxygen at the edges. This creates distinct active sites for catalysis.

5. The BOH groups at the edges play a crucial role in the catalytic process, as evidenced by FTIR analysis.

The method used to incorporate B active components in this case is steam activation, which creates hydroxylated edges on the boron nitride sheets. This method is effective for creating active sites for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane, resulting in high selectivity and low CO2 formation.

While this approach is effective for the specific catalytic application described (propane dehydrogenation), it may not be directly applicable to other catalytic systems requiring 3-D dispersed active sites. The effectiveness of this method is limited to 2-D materials and edge-based catalysis.

To fully address the question about 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks, additional research on different B-based materials and incorporation methods would be necessary.

这篇文献并没有直接讨论B基材料在多孔框架中的3-D分散活性位点。相反，它聚焦于边缘羟基化的氮化硼，这是一种2-D材料。然而，我们可以分析一些相关的结构特征及其对催化性能的影响：

1. 边缘羟基化的氮化硼的活性位点（BOH基团）集中在其2-D结构的边缘，而不是分散在3-D框架中。

2. 氮化硼的六方晶格结构得以保持，在蒸汽活化过程中创造了新的边缘。这增加了潜在活性位点的数量。

3. 氮化硼片的边缘显示局部弯曲或褶皱，这影响了边缘位点的电子结构和反应活性。

4. 存在两种类型的硼物种：一种与平面表面的氮配位，另一种在边缘与氧键合。这创造了独特的催化活性位点。

5. FTIR分析证实，边缘的BOH基团在催化过程中起着关键作用。

在这种情况下，用于引入B活性组分的方法是蒸汽活化，它在氮化硼片上创造了羟基化边缘。这种方法有效地创造了丙烷氧化脱氢的活性位点，resulting in高选择性和低CO2生成。

虽然这种方法对所描述的特定催化应用（丙烷脱氢）是有效的，但它可能不直接适用于需要3-D分散活性位点的其他催化系统。这种方法的有效性仅限于2-D材料和基于边缘的催化。

要全面回答关于多孔框架中3-D分散活性位点的问题，需要对不同的B基材料和引入方法进行额外的研究。
