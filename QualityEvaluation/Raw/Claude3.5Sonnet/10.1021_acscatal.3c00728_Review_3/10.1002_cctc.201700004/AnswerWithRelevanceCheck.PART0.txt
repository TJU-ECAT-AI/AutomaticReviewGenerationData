          [1] "Boron nitride was first impregnated with 1m sodium nitrite aqueous solution, followed by steam (5vol.% H2O/N2) activation at 530C for 3h; the resulting sample (BNOH) was washed with aqueous ammonia and finally calcined at 500C for 2h in air."

[2] "The BNOH catalyst inherited a hexagonal layered structure of boron nitride (FigureS3). Aberration-corrected transmission electron microscopy (TEM) analyses identified the in-plane lattice retained its hexagonal symmetry with a large number of edges that were newly created during steam activation"

[3] "X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis identified that the surface concentrations of boron and oxygen were 44.3% and 9.2% (Figure2c), respectively. There were two types of boron species (Figure2c); one was coordinated with nitrogen on the flat surface whereas the other was bonded to oxygen at the edge."

[4] "There were two types of boronoxygen bonding at 26.0 and 24.4ppm; the former represents the edge boron sites bonded to two bridging oxygen atoms, and the latter corresponded to BOH bonding, which was identified by the sharp 1H resonance at 1.2ppm in the 1H MAS NMR spectrum"

[5] "The BOH groups at the edges of boron nitride selectively activate the CH bond in propane and simultaneously suppress the overoxidation of propylene into CO2."

          The literature primarily discusses edge-hydroxylated boron nitride (BNOH), which is a 2-D material rather than a 3-D porous framework. However, we can analyze its structural characteristics and how they enhance catalytic performance:

1. Structure: BNOH retains the hexagonal layered structure of boron nitride, with newly created edges during steam activation. These edges serve as the primary locations for active sites.

2. Active sites: Two types of boron-oxygen bonding exist at the edges:
   a) Edge boron sites bonded to two bridging oxygen atoms (B-O-B)
   b) Boron hydroxyl groups (B-OH)

3. Composition: XPS analysis shows the surface contains 44.3% boron and 9.2% oxygen, indicating a significant presence of oxygen-containing active sites.

4. Catalytic mechanism: The B-OH groups at the edges selectively activate C-H bonds in propane while suppressing over-oxidation of propylene to CO2, enhancing selectivity and performance.

The method used to incorporate B active components involves:
1. Impregnation with sodium nitrite solution
2. Steam activation at high temperature (530°C)
3. Washing with aqueous ammonia
4. Calcination in air (500°C)

This approach effectively creates edge-functionalized 2-D materials with active sites for oxidative dehydrogenation reactions. The steam activation step is crucial for generating the active edge sites.

While effective for this specific application (propane dehydrogenation), the literature does not discuss the method's effectiveness for other catalytic applications or compare it to other methods for creating 3-D porous frameworks with dispersed active sites.

          该文献主要讨论了边缘羟基化的氮化硼（BNOH），这是一种二维材料，而不是三维多孔框架。然而，我们可以分析其结构特征以及它们如何增强催化性能：

1. 结构：BNOH保留了氮化硼的六方层状结构，在蒸汽活化过程中创造了新的边缘。这些边缘成为活性位点的主要位置。

2. 活性位点：边缘存在两种类型的硼-氧键合：
   a) 与两个桥接氧原子键合的边缘硼位点（B-O-B）
   b) 硼羟基（B-OH）

3. 组成：XPS分析显示表面含有44.3%的硼和9.2%的氧，表明存在大量含氧活性位点。

4. 催化机制：边缘的B-OH基团选择性地活化丙烷中的C-H键，同时抑制丙烯过度氧化为CO2，提高了选择性和性能。

用于引入B活性组分的方法包括：
1. 用亚硝酸钠溶液浸渍
2. 高温（530°C）蒸汽活化
3. 用氨水洗涤
4. 空气中煅烧（500°C）

这种方法有效地创造了具有氧化脱氢反应活性位点的边缘功能化二维材料。蒸汽活化步骤对于生成活性边缘位点至关重要。

虽然这种方法对特定应用（丙烷脱氢）有效，但文献并未讨论该方法对其他催化应用的有效性，也没有与创建具有分散活性位点的三维多孔框架的其他方法进行比较。
