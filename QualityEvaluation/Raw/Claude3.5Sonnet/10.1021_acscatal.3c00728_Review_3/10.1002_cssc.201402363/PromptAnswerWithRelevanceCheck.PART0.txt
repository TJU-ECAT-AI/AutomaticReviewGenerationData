[1] "Carbon nanofibres (CNFs) were modified with B and P by an exsitu approach. In addition, CNFs doped with N were prepared insitu using ethylenediamine as the N and C source."

[2] "For B-CNFs, the effects of boron loading and calcination temperature on B speciation and catalytic conversion were studied."

[3] "The increase in thermal resistance is only marginal for further B loading. The inhibition of carbon oxidation by modification with B has been studied widely for the preparation of oxidation-resistant carbon/carbon composites used as friction materials in aircraft brakes."

[4] "B-CNF samples seem to be stable in air until approximately 873K. The residue after carbon gasification increases slightly as the B content in the CNFs increases, presumably because of residual boron oxide."

[5] "As the calcination temperature increases, the peak widens to higher BEs if the material is calcined above 973K and additionally widens to lower BEs if the material is calcined at a higher temperature of 1173K. This suggests that new B species develop as the calcination temperature increases."

The literature does not provide sufficient information to fully analyze the structural characteristics of B-based materials with 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks. However, it does discuss some aspects of B incorporation into carbon nanofibers (CNFs) and its effects on catalytic performance:

1. B was incorporated into CNFs using an ex-situ approach, likely through impregnation with boric acid solutions.

2. The boron loading and calcination temperature affected the B speciation and catalytic conversion of the materials.

3. B modification improved the thermal resistance and oxidation stability of CNFs, with stability in air up to approximately 873K.

4. Higher calcination temperatures (above 973K) led to the development of new B species, as evidenced by changes in XPS peaks.

5. The incorporation of B enhanced selectivity to propene in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane, though excessive B loading could block active sites.

The methods described for incorporating B into CNFs appear effective for improving thermal stability and catalytic selectivity in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions. However, the literature does not provide a comprehensive evaluation of the effectiveness of these methods for different catalytic applications or a detailed analysis of the 3-D structural characteristics of the materials.

该文献并未提供足够的信息来全面分析具有3-D分散活性位点的多孔框架B基材料的结构特征。然而，它确实讨论了B掺杂到碳纳米纤维(CNFs)中的一些方面及其对催化性能的影响：

1. B是通过非原位方法掺杂到CNFs中的，可能是通过硼酸溶液浸渍实现的。

2. 硼的负载量和煅烧温度影响了材料中B的物种形态和催化转化率。

3. B的修饰提高了CNFs的耐热性和抗氧化稳定性，在空气中的稳定性可达约873K。

4. 较高的煅烧温度（高于973K）导致新的B物种的形成，这从XPS峰的变化中可以看出。

5. B的掺入提高了丙烷氧化脱氢反应中对丙烯的选择性，但过量的B负载可能会阻塞活性位点。

文献中描述的将B掺入CNFs的方法似乎对提高氧化脱氢反应的热稳定性和催化选择性是有效的。然而，该文献并未对这些方法在不同催化应用中的有效性进行全面评估，也未对材料的3-D结构特征进行详细分析。

[4] "This suggests that boron does not plug the pores of the original CNFs, but instead covers the pore walls. The increased surface area and pore volume could be explained tentatively by the etching of some amorphous carbon during calcination at 773K in the presence of boric acid."

[5] "The thermal stability increases by approximately 80K after only 0.5wt% B is deposited. The increase in thermal resistance is only marginal for further B loading."

The literature does not provide a comprehensive analysis of B-based materials with 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks. However, it does discuss some aspects of incorporating boron into carbon nanofibers (CNFs), which can be considered as a type of porous framework.

The structural characteristics of B-doped CNFs include:

1. Increased surface area and pore volume after doping with small amounts of boron (0.5 wt%).
2. Boron covering the pore walls rather than plugging the pores.
3. Enhanced thermal stability, with an increase of approximately 80K after 0.5 wt% B deposition.

These features can potentially enhance catalytic performance by:

1. Providing more accessible active sites due to increased surface area.
2. Maintaining pore structure and accessibility.
3. Improving catalyst stability at higher temperatures.

The method used to incorporate B active components into CNFs was incipient wetness impregnation of aqueous boric acid solutions, followed by calcination at 773K in N2 atmosphere. This method appears to be effective for creating well-dispersed B sites on the CNF surface without significantly altering the pore structure.

However, the literature does not provide enough information to critically evaluate the effectiveness of this method compared to others for different catalytic applications. More research would be needed to make such comparisons and to fully understand the 3-D dispersion of B sites within the CNF framework.

这篇文献并未全面分析具有三维分散活性位点的多孔框架中的硼基材料。然而，它确实讨论了将硼掺入碳纳米纤维(CNFs)的一些方面，这可以被视为一种多孔框架。

掺硼CNFs的结构特征包括：

1. 掺入少量硼(0.5 wt%)后，表面积和孔体积增加。
2. 硼覆盖在孔壁上，而不是堵塞孔道。
3. 热稳定性增强，在沉积0.5 wt%硼后，稳定性提高约80K。

这些特征可能通过以下方式增强催化性能：

1. 由于表面积增加，提供更多可接近的活性位点。
2. 保持孔结构和可接近性。
3. 提高催化剂在较高温度下的稳定性。

将硼活性组分掺入CNFs的方法是使用硼酸水溶液进行浸渍，然后在氮气氛围下773K焙烧。这种方法似乎能有效地在CNF表面创造分散良好的硼位点，而不显著改变孔结构。

然而，文献并未提供足够的信息来批判性地评估这种方法与其他方法相比在不同催化应用中的有效性。需要进行更多研究来进行这样的比较，并充分理解硼位点在CNF框架内的三维分散情况。

[1] "Pristine CNFs and CNFs with different B loadings were characterised texturally by N2 physisorption. All the isotherms are of Type IV with hysteresis loops at high relative pressures indicative of mesoporous materials."

[2] "The samples exhibit a broad pore size distribution with a peak maximum at 58nm for pristine CNFs and at 80nm for CNFs after B doping (FigureS2)."

[3] "Both the surface area and pore volume (Table1) increase after doping with only minor amounts of B (0.5wt% B). Further B doping diminishes the surface area and pore volume slightly, but the values are still larger than those for pristine CNFs."

[4] "This suggests that boron does not plug the pores of the original CNFs, but instead covers the pore walls. The increased surface area and pore volume could be explained tentatively by the etching of some amorphous carbon during calcination at 773K in the presence of boric acid."

[5] "Based on XPS assignments in the literature, after deconvolution of the spectra shown in Figure2, the peaks can be attributed to several B species summarised in Table2 and represented schematically in FigureS4."

[6] "A peak at BE=192.7eV (B1), which is the predominant peak in B-CNF calcined at 673 and 773K, can be attributed to B linked to three O atoms isolated or a (BO3)n chain bonded to the zig-zag face of the graphite lattice (FigureS4a)."

The B-based materials described in the literature exhibit several structural characteristics that enhance catalytic performance:

1. Mesoporous structure: The materials show Type IV isotherms with hysteresis loops, indicating a mesoporous nature. This provides good accessibility to active sites.

2. Broad pore size distribution: The pore sizes range from 58 nm for pristine CNFs to 80 nm for B-doped CNFs, allowing for efficient mass transfer of reactants and products.

3. Increased surface area and pore volume: Doping with small amounts of B (0.5 wt%) increases both surface area and pore volume, potentially providing more active sites for catalysis.

4. Boron distribution: B does not plug the pores but covers the pore walls, maintaining the porous structure while introducing active sites.

5. Multiple B species: XPS analysis reveals different B species present in the structure, including B linked to three O atoms and (BO3)n chains bonded to the graphite lattice.

The method used to incorporate B active components involves incipient wetness impregnation of aqueous boric acid solutions, followed by calcination at 773K in N2 atmosphere. This method appears effective for creating well-dispersed B sites without compromising the porous structure of the CNFs.

The effectiveness of this method for different catalytic applications depends on the specific reaction requirements. For the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane discussed in the paper, the B-doped CNFs showed improved selectivity to propene compared to pristine CNFs, indicating that this method is effective for this particular application. However, the literature does not provide information on the effectiveness of this method for other catalytic applications, so a comprehensive evaluation across different reactions is not possible based solely on this text.

文献中描述的B基材料展现了几个增强催化性能的结构特征：

1. 介孔结构：材料显示IV型等温线和滞后环，表明具有介孔性质。这为活性位点提供了良好的可及性。

2. 宽泛的孔径分布：孔径范围从原始CNFs的58 nm到B掺杂CNFs的80 nm，允许反应物和产物高效的质量传递。

3. 增加的表面积和孔体积：用少量B（0.5 wt%）掺杂会增加表面积和孔体积，可能提供更多的催化活性位点。

4. 硼的分布：B不会堵塞孔隙，而是覆盖在孔壁上，在引入活性位点的同时保持多孔结构。

5. 多种B物种：XPS分析显示结构中存在不同的B物种，包括与三个O原子连接的B和与石墨晶格结合的(BO3)n链。

用于引入B活性组分的方法包括硼酸水溶液的浸渍法，随后在N2气氛下773K下煅烧。这种方法似乎能有效地创造分散良好的B位点，而不影响CNFs的多孔结构。

这种方法对不同催化应用的有效性取决于特定反应的要求。对于文中讨论的丙烷氧化脱氢反应，B掺杂的CNFs与原始CNFs相比显示出更高的丙烯选择性，表明这种方法对这个特定应用是有效的。然而，文献没有提供这种方法对其他催化应用有效性的信息，因此仅基于这篇文章无法对不同反应进行全面评估。

The pore size distribution was estimated by the BarrettJoynerHalenda (BJH) method from the adsorption branch."

The literature does not provide a comprehensive analysis of B-based materials with 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks. However, it does discuss some aspects of B incorporation into carbon nanofibers (CNFs) and its effects on structure and catalytic performance:

1. Incorporation methods: The main method described for incorporating B into CNFs is incipient wetness impregnation using aqueous boric acid solutions, followed by calcination at 773K in N2 atmosphere. This ex-situ approach allows for controlled B loading.

2. Structural characteristics: B doping affects the surface area and pore volume of CNFs. Initially, with small amounts of B (0.5 wt%), both surface area and pore volume increase. Further B doping slightly decreases these values, but they remain higher than those of pristine CNFs. This suggests that B incorporation modifies the porous structure of CNFs.

3. Catalytic performance: While the text doesn't explicitly discuss 3-D dispersed active sites, it mentions that B-doped CNFs show enhanced selectivity in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane compared to pristine CNFs. This improvement in catalytic performance is likely related to the structural modifications induced by B incorporation.

4. Characterization methods: The study uses N2 adsorption (BET method) to measure specific surface area and the BJH method to estimate pore size distribution. XPS is also employed to analyze B speciation on the CNF surface.

The literature does not provide a critical evaluation of different B incorporation methods for various catalytic applications. To fully address the question, more comprehensive studies comparing different B incorporation techniques and their effects on 3-D active site distribution and catalytic performance in various reactions would be needed.

该文献并没有全面分析具有三维分散活性位点的多孔框架B基材料。然而，它确实讨论了将B掺入碳纳米纤维(CNFs)的一些方面及其对结构和催化性能的影响：

1. 掺入方法：描述的将B掺入CNFs的主要方法是使用水性硼酸溶液进行浸渍，然后在N2气氛下773K煅烧。这种非原位方法允许控制B的负载量。

2. 结构特征：B掺杂影响CNFs的比表面积和孔体积。最初，少量B（0.5wt%）的掺入会增加表面积和孔体积。进一步的B掺杂略微降低这些值，但仍高于原始CNFs。这表明B的掺入改变了CNFs的多孔结构。

3. 催化性能：虽然文本没有明确讨论三维分散活性位点，但提到B掺杂的CNFs在丙烷氧化脱氢反应中表现出比原始CNFs更高的选择性。这种催化性能的提高可能与B掺入导致的结构改变有关。

4. 表征方法：该研究使用N2吸附（BET方法）测量比表面积，使用BJH方法估算孔径分布。还使用XPS分析CNF表面的B物种。

文献没有对不同催化应用中各种B掺入方法进行批判性评估。要全面回答这个问题，需要更多比较不同B掺入技术及其对三维活性位点分布和各种反应中催化性能影响的综合研究。
