[1] "Carbon nanofibres (CNFs) were modified with B and P by an exsitu approach. In addition, CNFs doped with N were prepared insitu using ethylenediamine as the N and C source."

[2] "For B-CNFs, the effects of boron loading and calcination temperature on B speciation and catalytic conversion were studied."

[3] "The increase in thermal resistance is only marginal for further B loading. The inhibition of carbon oxidation by modification with B has been studied widely for the preparation of oxidation-resistant carbon/carbon composites used as friction materials in aircraft brakes."

[4] "B-CNF samples seem to be stable in air until approximately 873K. The residue after carbon gasification increases slightly as the B content in the CNFs increases, presumably because of residual boron oxide."

[5] "As the calcination temperature increases, the peak widens to higher BEs if the material is calcined above 973K and additionally widens to lower BEs if the material is calcined at a higher temperature of 1173K. This suggests that new B species develop as the calcination temperature increases."

The literature does not provide sufficient information to fully analyze the structural characteristics of B-based materials with 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks. However, it does discuss some aspects of B incorporation into carbon nanofibers (CNFs) and its effects on catalytic performance:

1. B was incorporated into CNFs using an ex-situ approach, likely through impregnation with boric acid solutions.

2. The boron loading and calcination temperature affected the B speciation and catalytic conversion of the materials.

3. B modification improved the thermal resistance and oxidation stability of CNFs, with stability in air up to approximately 873K.

4. Higher calcination temperatures (above 973K) led to the development of new B species, as evidenced by changes in XPS peaks.

5. The incorporation of B enhanced selectivity to propene in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane, though excessive B loading could block active sites.

The methods described for incorporating B into CNFs appear effective for improving thermal stability and catalytic selectivity in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions. However, the literature does not provide a comprehensive evaluation of the effectiveness of these methods for different catalytic applications or a detailed analysis of the 3-D structural characteristics of the materials.

该文献并未提供足够的信息来全面分析具有3-D分散活性位点的多孔框架B基材料的结构特征。然而，它确实讨论了B掺杂到碳纳米纤维(CNFs)中的一些方面及其对催化性能的影响：

1. B是通过非原位方法掺杂到CNFs中的，可能是通过硼酸溶液浸渍实现的。

2. 硼的负载量和煅烧温度影响了材料中B的物种形态和催化转化率。

3. B的修饰提高了CNFs的耐热性和抗氧化稳定性，在空气中的稳定性可达约873K。

4. 较高的煅烧温度（高于973K）导致新的B物种的形成，这从XPS峰的变化中可以看出。

5. B的掺入提高了丙烷氧化脱氢反应中对丙烯的选择性，但过量的B负载可能会阻塞活性位点。

文献中描述的将B掺入CNFs的方法似乎对提高氧化脱氢反应的热稳定性和催化选择性是有效的。然而，该文献并未对这些方法在不同催化应用中的有效性进行全面评估，也未对材料的3-D结构特征进行详细分析。
