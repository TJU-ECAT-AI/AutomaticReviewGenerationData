[1] "Carbon nanofibres (CNFs) were modified with B and P by an exsitu approach. In addition, CNFs doped with N were prepared insitu using ethylenediamine as the N and C source."

[2] "B-CNFs with different B loadings were prepared by the incipient wetness impregnation of aqueous boric acid solutions. Subsequently, the B-CNFs were calcined at 773K as the standard temperature in N2 atmosphere."

[3] "Both the surface area and pore volume (Table1) increase after doping with only minor amounts of B (0.5wt% B). Further B doping diminishes the surface area and pore volume slightly, but the values are still larger than those for pristine CNFs."

[4] "This suggests that boron does not plug the pores of the original CNFs, but instead covers the pore walls. The increased surface area and pore volume could be explained tentatively by the etching of some amorphous carbon during calcination at 773K in the presence of boric acid."

[5] "The thermal stability increases by approximately 80K after only 0.5wt% B is deposited. The increase in thermal resistance is only marginal for further B loading."

The literature does not provide a comprehensive analysis of B-based materials with 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks. However, it does discuss some aspects of incorporating boron into carbon nanofibers (CNFs), which can be considered as a type of porous framework.

The structural characteristics of B-doped CNFs include:

1. Increased surface area and pore volume after doping with small amounts of boron (0.5 wt%).
2. Boron covering the pore walls rather than plugging the pores.
3. Enhanced thermal stability, with an increase of approximately 80K after 0.5 wt% B deposition.

These features can potentially enhance catalytic performance by:

1. Providing more accessible active sites due to increased surface area.
2. Maintaining pore structure and accessibility.
3. Improving catalyst stability at higher temperatures.

The method used to incorporate B active components into CNFs was incipient wetness impregnation of aqueous boric acid solutions, followed by calcination at 773K in N2 atmosphere. This method appears to be effective for creating well-dispersed B sites on the CNF surface without significantly altering the pore structure.

However, the literature does not provide enough information to critically evaluate the effectiveness of this method compared to others for different catalytic applications. More research would be needed to make such comparisons and to fully understand the 3-D dispersion of B sites within the CNF framework.

这篇文献并未全面分析具有三维分散活性位点的多孔框架中的硼基材料。然而，它确实讨论了将硼掺入碳纳米纤维(CNFs)的一些方面，这可以被视为一种多孔框架。

掺硼CNFs的结构特征包括：

1. 掺入少量硼(0.5 wt%)后，表面积和孔体积增加。
2. 硼覆盖在孔壁上，而不是堵塞孔道。
3. 热稳定性增强，在沉积0.5 wt%硼后，稳定性提高约80K。

这些特征可能通过以下方式增强催化性能：

1. 由于表面积增加，提供更多可接近的活性位点。
2. 保持孔结构和可接近性。
3. 提高催化剂在较高温度下的稳定性。

将硼活性组分掺入CNFs的方法是使用硼酸水溶液进行浸渍，然后在氮气氛围下773K焙烧。这种方法似乎能有效地在CNF表面创造分散良好的硼位点，而不显著改变孔结构。

然而，文献并未提供足够的信息来批判性地评估这种方法与其他方法相比在不同催化应用中的有效性。需要进行更多研究来进行这样的比较，并充分理解硼位点在CNF框架内的三维分散情况。
