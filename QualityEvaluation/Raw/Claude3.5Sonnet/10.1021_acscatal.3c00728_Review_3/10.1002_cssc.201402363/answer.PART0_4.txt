[1] "Carbon nanofibres (CNFs) were modified with B and P by an exsitu approach. In addition, CNFs doped with N were prepared insitu using ethylenediamine as the N and C source."

[2] "B-CNFs with different B loadings were prepared by the incipient wetness impregnation of aqueous boric acid solutions. Subsequently, the B-CNFs were calcined at 773K as the standard temperature in N2 atmosphere."

[3] "Both the surface area and pore volume (Table1) increase after doping with only minor amounts of B (0.5wt% B). Further B doping diminishes the surface area and pore volume slightly, but the values are still larger than those for pristine CNFs."

[4] "The thermal stability increases by approximately 80K after only 0.5wt% B is deposited. The increase in thermal resistance is only marginal for further B loading."

[5] "As the calcination temperature increases, the peak widens to higher BEs if the material is calcined above 973K and additionally widens to lower BEs if the material is calcined at a higher temperature of 1173K. This suggests that new B species develop as the calcination temperature increases."

The literature does not provide a comprehensive analysis of B-based materials with 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks. However, it does discuss some aspects of B incorporation into carbon nanofibers (CNFs) and its effects on catalytic performance:

1. B incorporation method: B was incorporated into CNFs using an ex-situ approach, specifically through incipient wetness impregnation of aqueous boric acid solutions followed by calcination at 773K in N2 atmosphere.

2. Structural characteristics: 
- Surface area and pore volume increased with minor B doping (0.5 wt%), though further B doping slightly decreased these values.
- Thermal stability of CNFs increased by approximately 80K with 0.5 wt% B doping.

3. Effect of preparation conditions:
- Calcination temperature affected the types of B species formed. Higher temperatures (above 973K) led to the development of new B species.

4. Catalytic performance enhancement:
- The literature does not provide direct information on how these structural features enhance catalytic performance for B-doped CNFs.

5. Evaluation of incorporation methods:
- The study focuses primarily on one method (incipient wetness impregnation) for B incorporation. It does not critically evaluate or compare different methods for incorporating B active components.

While the study provides some insights into B incorporation in CNFs, it lacks a comprehensive analysis of 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks and does not critically evaluate various incorporation methods for different catalytic applications.

该文献并未提供对具有3D分散活性位点的多孔框架B基材料的全面分析。然而，它确实讨论了B掺杂到碳纳米纤维(CNFs)中的一些方面及其对催化性能的影响：

1. B掺杂方法：B通过非原位方法掺杂到CNFs中，具体是通过硼酸水溶液的浸渍impregnation法，然后在773K下的N2气氛中煅烧。

2. 结构特征：
- 少量B掺杂(0.5 wt%)会增加表面积和孔体积，但进一步增加B掺杂量会略微降低这些值。
- 0.5 wt%的B掺杂使CNFs的热稳定性提高了约80K。

3. 制备条件的影响：
- 煅烧温度影响形成的B物种类型。较高的温度(高于973K)会导致新的B物种的形成。

4. 催化性能的提升：
- 该文献并未直接提供这些结构特征如何提高B掺杂CNFs的催化性能的信息。

5. 掺杂方法的评估：
- 该研究主要关注B掺杂的一种方法(浸渍impregnation法)。它没有对不同的B活性组分掺杂方法进行批评性评估或比较。

虽然该研究提供了一些关于B掺杂到CNFs中的见解，但缺乏对多孔框架中3D分散活性位点的全面分析，也没有对不同催化应用的各种掺杂方法进行批评性评估。
