[1] "Pristine CNFs and CNFs with different B loadings were characterised texturally by N2 physisorption. All the isotherms are of Type IV with hysteresis loops at high relative pressures indicative of mesoporous materials."

[2] "The samples exhibit a broad pore size distribution with a peak maximum at 58nm for pristine CNFs and at 80nm for CNFs after B doping (FigureS2)."

[3] "Both the surface area and pore volume (Table1) increase after doping with only minor amounts of B (0.5wt% B). Further B doping diminishes the surface area and pore volume slightly, but the values are still larger than those for pristine CNFs."

[4] "This suggests that boron does not plug the pores of the original CNFs, but instead covers the pore walls. The increased surface area and pore volume could be explained tentatively by the etching of some amorphous carbon during calcination at 773K in the presence of boric acid."

[5] "Based on XPS assignments in the literature, after deconvolution of the spectra shown in Figure2, the peaks can be attributed to several B species summarised in Table2 and represented schematically in FigureS4."

[6] "A peak at BE=192.7eV (B1), which is the predominant peak in B-CNF calcined at 673 and 773K, can be attributed to B linked to three O atoms isolated or a (BO3)n chain bonded to the zig-zag face of the graphite lattice (FigureS4a)."

The B-based materials described in the literature exhibit several structural characteristics that enhance catalytic performance:

1. Mesoporous structure: The materials show Type IV isotherms with hysteresis loops, indicating a mesoporous nature. This provides good accessibility to active sites.

2. Broad pore size distribution: The pore sizes range from 58 nm for pristine CNFs to 80 nm for B-doped CNFs, allowing for efficient mass transfer of reactants and products.

3. Increased surface area and pore volume: Doping with small amounts of B (0.5 wt%) increases both surface area and pore volume, potentially providing more active sites for catalysis.

4. Boron distribution: B does not plug the pores but covers the pore walls, maintaining the porous structure while introducing active sites.

5. Multiple B species: XPS analysis reveals different B species present in the structure, including B linked to three O atoms and (BO3)n chains bonded to the graphite lattice.

The method used to incorporate B active components involves incipient wetness impregnation of aqueous boric acid solutions, followed by calcination at 773K in N2 atmosphere. This method appears effective for creating well-dispersed B sites without compromising the porous structure of the CNFs.

The effectiveness of this method for different catalytic applications depends on the specific reaction requirements. For the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane discussed in the paper, the B-doped CNFs showed improved selectivity to propene compared to pristine CNFs, indicating that this method is effective for this particular application. However, the literature does not provide information on the effectiveness of this method for other catalytic applications, so a comprehensive evaluation across different reactions is not possible based solely on this text.

文献中描述的B基材料展现了几个增强催化性能的结构特征：

1. 介孔结构：材料显示IV型等温线和滞后环，表明具有介孔性质。这为活性位点提供了良好的可及性。

2. 宽泛的孔径分布：孔径范围从原始CNFs的58 nm到B掺杂CNFs的80 nm，允许反应物和产物高效的质量传递。

3. 增加的表面积和孔体积：用少量B（0.5 wt%）掺杂会增加表面积和孔体积，可能提供更多的催化活性位点。

4. 硼的分布：B不会堵塞孔隙，而是覆盖在孔壁上，在引入活性位点的同时保持多孔结构。

5. 多种B物种：XPS分析显示结构中存在不同的B物种，包括与三个O原子连接的B和与石墨晶格结合的(BO3)n链。

用于引入B活性组分的方法包括硼酸水溶液的浸渍法，随后在N2气氛下773K下煅烧。这种方法似乎能有效地创造分散良好的B位点，而不影响CNFs的多孔结构。

这种方法对不同催化应用的有效性取决于特定反应的要求。对于文中讨论的丙烷氧化脱氢反应，B掺杂的CNFs与原始CNFs相比显示出更高的丙烯选择性，表明这种方法对这个特定应用是有效的。然而，文献没有提供这种方法对其他催化应用有效性的信息，因此仅基于这篇文章无法对不同反应进行全面评估。
