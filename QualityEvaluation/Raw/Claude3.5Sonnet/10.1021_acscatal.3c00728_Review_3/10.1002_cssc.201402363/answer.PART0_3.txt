[1] "Carbon nanofibres (CNFs) were modified with B and P by an exsitu approach. In addition, CNFs doped with N were prepared insitu using ethylenediamine as the N and C source."

[2] "B-CNFs with different B loadings were prepared by the incipient wetness impregnation of aqueous boric acid solutions. Subsequently, the B-CNFs were calcined at 773K as the standard temperature in N2 atmosphere."

[3] "CNFs were also doped with P by incipient wetness impregnation employing triphenylphosphine and ammonium phosphate as precursors. After impregnation, the samples were dried at RT and calcined at 773K."

[4] "The specific surface area was measured by N2 adsorption using the BET method in the relative pressure range 0.010.10 following the ASTM-4365 standard by using a Micromeritics ASAP 2020 instrument at 77K. The pore size distribution was estimated by the BarrettJoynerHalenda (BJH) method from the adsorption branch."

[5] "Both the surface area and pore volume (Table1) increase after doping with only minor amounts of B (0.5wt% B). Further B doping diminishes the surface area and pore volume slightly, but the values are still larger than those for pristine CNFs."

The literature does not provide a comprehensive analysis of B-based materials with 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks. However, it does discuss some aspects of B incorporation into carbon nanofibers (CNFs) and its effects on structure and catalytic performance:

1. Incorporation methods: The main method described for incorporating B into CNFs is incipient wetness impregnation using aqueous boric acid solutions, followed by calcination at 773K in N2 atmosphere. This ex-situ approach allows for controlled B loading.

2. Structural characteristics: B doping affects the surface area and pore volume of CNFs. Initially, with small amounts of B (0.5 wt%), both surface area and pore volume increase. Further B doping slightly decreases these values, but they remain higher than those of pristine CNFs. This suggests that B incorporation modifies the porous structure of CNFs.

3. Catalytic performance: While the text doesn't explicitly discuss 3-D dispersed active sites, it mentions that B-doped CNFs show enhanced selectivity in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane compared to pristine CNFs. This improvement in catalytic performance is likely related to the structural modifications induced by B incorporation.

4. Characterization methods: The study uses N2 adsorption (BET method) to measure specific surface area and the BJH method to estimate pore size distribution. XPS is also employed to analyze B speciation on the CNF surface.

The literature does not provide a critical evaluation of different B incorporation methods for various catalytic applications. To fully address the question, more comprehensive studies comparing different B incorporation techniques and their effects on 3-D active site distribution and catalytic performance in various reactions would be needed.

该文献并没有全面分析具有三维分散活性位点的多孔框架B基材料。然而，它确实讨论了将B掺入碳纳米纤维(CNFs)的一些方面及其对结构和催化性能的影响：

1. 掺入方法：描述的将B掺入CNFs的主要方法是使用水性硼酸溶液进行浸渍，然后在N2气氛下773K煅烧。这种非原位方法允许控制B的负载量。

2. 结构特征：B掺杂影响CNFs的比表面积和孔体积。最初，少量B（0.5wt%）的掺入会增加表面积和孔体积。进一步的B掺杂略微降低这些值，但仍高于原始CNFs。这表明B的掺入改变了CNFs的多孔结构。

3. 催化性能：虽然文本没有明确讨论三维分散活性位点，但提到B掺杂的CNFs在丙烷氧化脱氢反应中表现出比原始CNFs更高的选择性。这种催化性能的提高可能与B掺入导致的结构改变有关。

4. 表征方法：该研究使用N2吸附（BET方法）测量比表面积，使用BJH方法估算孔径分布。还使用XPS分析CNF表面的B物种。

文献没有对不同催化应用中各种B掺入方法进行批判性评估。要全面回答这个问题，需要更多比较不同B掺入技术及其对三维活性位点分布和各种反应中催化性能影响的综合研究。
