The given literature does not contain information specifically related to B-based materials with 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks or their catalytic performance. The text primarily focuses on the synthesis and characterization of hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) thin films using nanocrystalline graphene (nc-G) as a catalytic seed layer. It does not discuss 3-D porous B-based materials or their catalytic applications.

The document does mention some structural characteristics of h-BN thin films and their growth mechanism, but these are 2-D structures rather than 3-D porous frameworks. The text also does not provide information on methods to incorporate B active components into porous structures for catalytic applications.

Given the lack of relevant information in the provided literature, it is not possible to answer the question about B-based materials with 3-D dispersed active sites, their catalytic performance, or methods to incorporate B active components into porous frameworks for catalytic applications.

所给的文献并不包含特别关于具有三维分散活性位点的多孔框架B基材料或其催化性能的信息。该文本主要关注使用纳米晶石墨烯(nc-G)作为催化种子层合成和表征六方氮化硼(h-BN)薄膜。它没有讨论三维多孔B基材料或其催化应用。

文档确实提到了h-BN薄膜的一些结构特征及其生长机制，但这些是二维结构而不是三维多孔框架。文本也没有提供将B活性组分掺入多孔结构用于催化应用的方法信息。

鉴于所提供的文献中缺乏相关信息，无法回答关于具有三维分散活性位点的B基材料、其催化性能或将B活性组分掺入多孔框架用于催化应用的方法的问题。
