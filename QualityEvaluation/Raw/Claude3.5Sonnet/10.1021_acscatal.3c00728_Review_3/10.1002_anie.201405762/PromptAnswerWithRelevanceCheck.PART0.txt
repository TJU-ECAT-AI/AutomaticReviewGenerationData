Read the questions and answers provided below. First, critically assess the overall relevance of the answers provided to the set of questions asked.

If, upon your assessment, you find that the answers do not contain information that is relevant to the questions asked, stop your review process immediately and respond with a single sentence: "※※※※※※※The provided answers are not relevant to the questions.※※※※※※※". Do not provide any additional explanation or background information, only this sentence should be given as a response in case of irrelevant answers.

If, however, the answers are relevant to the questions asked, proceed to compile answers for each question according to the instructions below. Ensure to aggregate all the relevant answers from the multiple answer results provided in the document, and organize them sequentially by their order number, compiling the corresponding quotes, English answers, and Chinese answers for each question.

If the provided answers' quotes are not differentiated by question, ensure to break them down and assign the quotes to each respective question, outputting them separately within each question's section.

To provide a comprehensive review, differentiate the responses into quotes, English answers, and Chinese answers for each question based on the details given in the 'Answer' XML tags. Structure your review using the XML format showcased below if the answers are relevant to the questions asked:

<EnglishVersionAnswer>

The given literature does not contain information specifically related to B-based materials with 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks or their catalytic performance. The text primarily focuses on the synthesis and characterization of hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) thin films using nanocrystalline graphene (nc-G) as a catalytic seed layer. It does not discuss 3-D porous B-based materials or their catalytic applications.

The document does mention some structural characteristics of h-BN thin films and their growth mechanism, but these are 2-D structures rather than 3-D porous frameworks. The text also does not provide information on methods to incorporate B active components into porous structures for catalytic applications.

Given the lack of relevant information in the provided literature, it is not possible to answer the question about B-based materials with 3-D dispersed active sites, their catalytic performance, or methods to incorporate B active components into porous frameworks for catalytic applications.

所给的文献并不包含特别关于具有三维分散活性位点的多孔框架B基材料或其催化性能的信息。该文本主要关注使用纳米晶石墨烯(nc-G)作为催化种子层合成和表征六方氮化硼(h-BN)薄膜。它没有讨论三维多孔B基材料或其催化应用。

文档确实提到了h-BN薄膜的一些结构特征及其生长机制，但这些是二维结构而不是三维多孔框架。文本也没有提供将B活性组分掺入多孔结构用于催化应用的方法信息。

鉴于所提供的文献中缺乏相关信息，无法回答关于具有三维分散活性位点的B基材料、其催化性能或将B活性组分掺入多孔框架用于催化应用的方法的问题。
