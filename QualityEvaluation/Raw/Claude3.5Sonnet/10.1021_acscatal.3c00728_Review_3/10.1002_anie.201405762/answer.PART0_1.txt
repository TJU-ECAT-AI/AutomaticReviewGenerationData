<EnglishVersionAnswer>

The given literature does not contain information specifically about B-based materials with 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks or their catalytic performance. The document primarily focuses on the synthesis and characteristics of hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) thin films grown using nanocrystalline graphene (nc-G) as a seed layer. It does not discuss 3-D porous structures or catalytic applications of boron-based materials. Therefore, this question cannot be adequately answered based on the provided literature.
