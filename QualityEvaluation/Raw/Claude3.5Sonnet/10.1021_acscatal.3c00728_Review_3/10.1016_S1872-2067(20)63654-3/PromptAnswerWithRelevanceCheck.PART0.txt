The structural characteristics of B-based materials with 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks include:

1. Ordered macroporous structure with interconnected pores
2. Large pore volume and high surface area
3. Inverse replica of the template used in synthesis
4. Tri-coordinated boron species as active sites

These features enhance catalytic performance by:

1. Improving mass transport and reducing diffusion limitations
2. Exposing a higher number of active sites
3. Enabling better accessibility to reactive sites
4. Allowing for lower reaction temperatures to achieve equivalent conversion
5. Greatly improving yield due to enhanced kinetic diffusion

The method used to incorporate B active components into these structures was hydrothermal-assisted synthesis followed by calcination. This method appears to be effective for creating ordered macroporous BPO4 with well-dispersed active sites for oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of propane. The effectiveness of this method for other catalytic applications would depend on the specific reaction requirements and desired catalyst properties.

This approach is particularly beneficial for diffusion-limited reaction processes and high-temperature oxidative reactions. However, its effectiveness may vary for different catalytic applications depending on factors such as:

1. Required pore size and distribution
2. Nature of active sites needed
3. Thermal and chemical stability requirements
4. Specific mass transfer and diffusion needs of the reaction

Overall, this method shows promise for creating metal-free oxide catalysts with enhanced performance, but further research would be needed to evaluate its effectiveness across a broader range of catalytic applications.

具有3D分散活性位点的B基材料在多孔框架中的结构特征包括：

1. 有序的大孔结构，孔洞互连
2. 大孔体积和高比表面积
3. 合成中使用的模板的反向复制
4. 三配位硼物种作为活性位点

这些特征通过以下方式增强催化性能：

1. 改善质量传递并减少扩散限制
2. 暴露更多的活性位点
3. 提高反应位点的可及性
4. 在较低反应温度下实现相同的转化率
5. 由于动力学扩散增强，大大提高产率

将B活性组分结合到这些结构中的方法是水热辅助合成，然后进行煅烧。这种方法似乎对于创建具有良好分散活性位点的有序大孔BPO4非常有效，适用于丙烷的氧化脱氢（ODH）。这种方法对其他催化应用的有效性将取决于特定的反应要求和所需的催化剂性质。

这种方法特别有利于扩散受限的反应过程和高温氧化反应。然而，其对不同催化应用的有效性可能会因以下因素而异：

1. 所需的孔隙大小和分布
2. 所需活性位点的性质
3. 热稳定性和化学稳定性要求
4. 反应的特定质量传递和扩散需求

总的来说，这种方法在创建具有增强性能的无金属氧化物催化剂方面显示出前景，但需要进一步研究以评估其在更广泛的催化应用范围内的有效性。

The 3-D dispersed active sites in porous B-based materials significantly enhance catalytic performance through several structural characteristics:

1. Improved mass transport: The ordered macroporous structure facilitates better diffusion of reactants and products throughout the catalyst.

2. Reduced diffusion limitations: Interconnected macropores with large volumes allow for easier access to active sites, especially under high space velocity conditions.

3. Increased active site exposure: The porous framework exposes a larger number of active sites compared to bulk materials.

4. Structural stability: The ordered macroporous BPO4 framework exhibits remarkable stability during catalytic reactions.

The main method used to incorporate B active components into these structures is hydrothermal-assisted synthesis using a hard template (polybenzoxazine polymer spheres). This approach effectively creates an inverse replica of the template, resulting in interconnected macropores with an average diameter of 200 nm.

The effectiveness of this method for catalytic applications is demonstrated by:

1. Higher catalytic activity: BPO4(OM) showed significantly better performance than BPO4(bulk) in the oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of propane.

2. Increased productivity: The ordered macroporous structure allowed for much higher olefin productivity compared to bulk materials and other reported catalysts.

3. Enhanced selectivity: The catalyst maintained high selectivity for desired products (propene and ethene) while minimizing unwanted deep oxidation products.

4. Stability: The structure remained stable during long-term catalytic testing.

The tri-coordinated surface boron species were identified as the active catalytic sites, with their content increasing during the reaction. This suggests that the method is effective in creating and maintaining the desired active sites for ODH reactions.

While this approach has proven highly effective for the ODH of propane, its relative effectiveness for other catalytic applications would require further investigation. However, the principles of improved mass transport and increased active site accessibility are likely to be beneficial in various catalytic processes, particularly those involving gas-phase reactions or diffusion-limited systems.

基于B的材料中的3D分散活性位点通过几个结构特征显著提高了催化性能：

1. 改善的质量传输：有序的大孔结构有助于反应物和产物在整个催化剂中更好地扩散。

2. 减少扩散限制：大体积的互连大孔使活性位点更容易被接触到，特别是在高空速条件下。

3. 增加活性位点暴露：与块状材料相比，多孔框架暴露了更多的活性位点。

4. 结构稳定性：有序大孔BPO4框架在催化反应过程中表现出显著的稳定性。

将B活性组分引入这些结构的主要方法是使用硬模板（聚苯并恶嗪聚合物球）进行水热辅助合成。这种方法有效地创造了模板的反向复制品，形成了平均直径为200nm的互连大孔。

这种方法对催化应用的有效性体现在：

1. 更高的催化活性：在丙烷的氧化脱氢（ODH）反应中，BPO4(OM)比BPO4(bulk)表现出显著更好的性能。

2. 提高的生产力：有序大孔结构允许比块状材料和其他报道的催化剂具有更高的烯烃生产力。

3. 增强的选择性：催化剂保持了对目标产物（丙烯和乙烯）的高选择性，同时最小化了不需要的深度氧化产物。

4. 稳定性：在长期催化测试中，结构保持稳定。

三配位表面硼物种被确定为活性催化位点，其含量在反应过程中增加。这表明该方法在创建和维持ODH反应所需的活性位点方面是有效的。

虽然这种方法已被证明对丙烷的ODH非常有效，但对其他催化应用的相对有效性还需要进一步研究。然而，改善的质量传输和增加的活性位点可及性原则可能对各种催化过程都有益，特别是涉及气相反应或扩散限制系统的过程。

The 3-D dispersed active sites in porous B-based materials significantly enhance catalytic performance through several structural characteristics:

1. Improved mass transport and reduced diffusion limitations due to the ordered macroporous architecture. This allows reactants to access active sites more easily and products to diffuse away quickly.

2. Increased exposure of active sites. The porous structure provides a larger surface area, exposing more active sites for catalysis.

3. Enhanced stability. The interconnected framework of macropores bridged by smaller channels creates a robust structure that maintains catalytic activity over time.

4. Tailored electronic properties. The coordination environment of boron sites (tri- vs tetra-coordinated) influences their electron density and binding properties, which can be optimized for specific catalytic applications.

The main method used to incorporate B active components in this study was hydrothermal-assisted synthesis using a hard template approach. This method proved effective for creating an ordered macroporous structure with well-dispersed active sites. The use of polybenzoxazine polymer spheres as templates allowed for precise control over pore size and interconnectivity.

This approach is particularly effective for oxidative dehydrogenation reactions, where mass transfer and heat dissipation are crucial. However, its effectiveness may vary for other catalytic applications. For reactions less sensitive to diffusion limitations, simpler synthesis methods might suffice.

The critical factor in this method's success is its ability to create a high surface area material with accessible active sites while maintaining structural stability. This balance is key to achieving high catalytic productivity and selectivity.

B基多孔材料中的三维分散活性位点通过以下结构特征显著提高了催化性能：

1. 有序大孔结构改善了质量传输并减少了扩散限制。这使反应物更容易接触到活性位点，产物也能快速扩散。

2. 增加了活性位点的暴露。多孔结构提供了更大的表面积，暴露出更多的催化活性位点。

3. 增强稳定性。由小通道连接的大孔互连框架形成了一个稳固的结构，能长期保持催化活性。

4. 定制的电子性质。硼位点的配位环境（三配位与四配位）影响其电子密度和结合性质，可针对特定催化应用进行优化。

本研究中用于引入B活性组分的主要方法是利用硬模板法进行水热辅助合成。这种方法在创建具有均匀分散活性位点的有序大孔结构方面证明是有效的。使用聚苯并恶嗪聚合物球体作为模板，可以精确控制孔隙大小和互连性。

这种方法对于氧化脱氢反应特别有效，因为在这类反应中质量传递和热量耗散至关重要。然而，对于其他催化应用，其有效性可能会有所不同。对于扩散限制不那么敏感的反应，可能更简单的合成方法就足够了。

这种方法成功的关键在于它能够创造出具有可接触活性位点的高比表面积材料，同时保持结构稳定性。这种平衡是实现高催化生产力和选择性的关键。
