[1] "Ordered macroporous materials have an extremely favorable architecture, which can improve mass transport, reduce diffusion limitations, and expose a large number of active sites"

[2] "BPO4(OM) exhibited a productivity of 16 golefin gcat1 h1. This value was remarkably higher than that of the BPO4(bulk) (1.2 golefin gcat1 h1) and of the reported catalysts (Table S1) used in the ODH process"

[3] "The interconnected macropores of the BPO4(OM) sample were formed through the inverse templating effect of the polybenzoxazine polymer spheres, consisting of a matrix of macropores bridged by ink-bottle neck-like channels of 80 nm in diameter."

[4] "The tri-coordinated surface boron species were identified as the active catalytic sites for the ODH of propane."

[5] "The content of tri-coordinated surface boron species increased from ca. 41% in fresh BPO4(OM) to 51% in the spent catalyst (Table S3). These results likely indicate that the tri-coordinated boron species were responsible for the ODH of propane."

The structural characteristics of B-based materials with 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks include:

1. Ordered macroporous structure that improves mass transport and reduces diffusion limitations.

2. Interconnected macropores formed through inverse templating, creating a matrix of macropores bridged by ink-bottle neck-like channels.

3. High exposure of active sites, particularly tri-coordinated boron species on the surface.

These features enhance catalytic performance by:

1. Facilitating mass transfer and allowing easier access to active sites.
2. Providing a large number of exposed active sites for catalysis.
3. Enabling high productivity under high space velocity conditions.

The method used to incorporate B active components into these structures involves:

1. Hydrothermal-assisted synthesis using boric acid as a boron source.
2. Using polybenzoxazine polymer spheres as a hard template to create the ordered macroporous structure.
3. Calcination to remove the template and form the final BPO4 structure.

This method is effective for creating catalysts with high surface area and well-dispersed active sites, particularly suitable for oxidative dehydrogenation reactions. The effectiveness of this approach is demonstrated by the significantly higher productivity of the ordered macroporous BPO4 compared to bulk BPO4 and other reported catalysts in the ODH process.

However, the effectiveness of this method may vary for different catalytic applications. While it excels in reactions requiring high mass transfer and exposed active sites, it may not be as beneficial for reactions that are not diffusion-limited or require different types of active sites.

具有3-D分散活性位点的B基材料在多孔框架中的结构特征包括：

1. 有序的大孔结构，可改善质量传输并减少扩散限制。
2. 通过反向模板形成的互连大孔，创建了由墨水瓶颈状通道连接的大孔矩阵。
3. 活性位点高度暴露，特别是表面上的三配位硼物种。

这些特征通过以下方式增强催化性能：

1. 促进质量传递，使活性位点更容易接近。
2. 提供大量暴露的活性位点用于催化。
3. 在高空速条件下实现高生产力。

将B活性成分引入这些结构的方法包括：

1. 使用硼酸作为硼源的水热辅助合成。
2. 使用聚苯并恶嗪聚合物球体作为硬模板来创建有序的大孔结构。
3. 煅烧以去除模板并形成最终的BPO4结构。

这种方法对于创建具有高比表面积和良好分散活性位点的催化剂非常有效，特别适用于氧化脱氢反应。有序大孔BPO4与块状BPO4和其他报道的催化剂相比，在ODH过程中显著更高的生产力证明了这种方法的有效性。

然而，这种方法对不同催化应用的有效性可能会有所不同。虽然它在需要高质量传递和暴露活性位点的反应中表现出色，但对于不受扩散限制或需要不同类型活性位点的反应可能不太有利。
