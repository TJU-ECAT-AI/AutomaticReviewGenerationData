          [1] "Ordered macroporous materials have an extremely favorable architecture, which can improve mass transport, reduce diffusion limitations, and expose a large number of active sites"

[2] "The ordered macroporous structure was an inverse replica of the template, with an average diameter of 200 nm for the interconnected macropores"

[3] "BPO4(OM) possessed abundant and fully interconnected macropores with a large volume."

[4] "The interconnected and open macropores of BPO4 are beneficial to the mass transfer to allow the active sites easily accessible and lead to better catalytic efficiency under high space velocity conditions"

[5] "The tri-coordinated surface boron species were identified as the active catalytic sites for the ODH of propane."

[6] "The content of tri-coordinated surface boron species increased from ca. 41% in fresh BPO4(OM) to 51% in the spent catalyst"

[7] "The interconnected macropores of the BPO4(OM) sample were formed through the inverse templating effect of the polybenzoxazine polymer spheres, consisting of a matrix of macropores bridged by ink-bottle neck-like channels of 80 nm in diameter."

[8] "The presence of the excess electron density in its vicinity is expected to perturb the binding strength of 1s electron and shift the bind energy to a lower value. The tetra-coordinated boron species represented the transition region to extend the bulk structure to the surface."

[9] "The tri-coordinated B site has less electron density in its vicinity than the tetra-coordinated B site since in these species B always remained with a former oxidation state of +3, which was neutralized when being tri-coordinated while felt excess negative charge when tetra-coordinated."

          The structural characteristics of B-based materials with 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks include:

1. Ordered macroporous structure: An inverse replica of the template with interconnected macropores of average diameter 200 nm.
2. Large pore volume and high surface area: Abundant and fully interconnected macropores.
3. Hierarchical pore structure: Matrix of macropores bridged by ink-bottle neck-like channels of 80 nm in diameter.
4. Well-dispersed active sites: Tri-coordinated surface boron species identified as the active catalytic sites.
5. Tailored electronic properties: Different coordination environments (tri- vs tetra-coordinated) of boron sites influencing their electron density and binding properties.

These features enhance catalytic performance by:

1. Improving mass transport and reducing diffusion limitations.
2. Exposing a higher number of active sites.
3. Enabling better accessibility to reactive sites, especially under high space velocity conditions.
4. Allowing for lower reaction temperatures to achieve equivalent conversion.
5. Greatly improving yield due to enhanced kinetic diffusion.
6. Providing stability during catalytic reactions.

The main method used to incorporate B active components into these structures is hydrothermal-assisted synthesis using a hard template approach. This method involves:

1. Using boric acid as the boron source.
2. Employing polybenzoxazine polymer spheres as templates to create the ordered macroporous structure.
3. Calcination to remove the template and form the final BPO4 structure.

This approach is particularly effective for creating metal-free oxide catalysts with enhanced performance in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions. It allows for precise control over pore size, interconnectivity, and active site dispersion.

The effectiveness of this method for different catalytic applications varies:

1. Highly effective for reactions requiring improved mass transfer and high accessibility of active sites, such as oxidative dehydrogenation of propane.
2. May be less beneficial for reactions that are not diffusion-limited or require different types of active sites.
3. The balance between high surface area, accessible active sites, and structural stability is key to achieving high catalytic productivity and selectivity.

Overall, this method shows promise for creating catalysts with tailored properties, but its effectiveness should be evaluated on a case-by-case basis for different catalytic applications.

          具有3-D分散活性位点的B基材料在多孔框架中的结构特征包括：

1. 有序的大孔结构：模板的反向复制品，具有平均直径200 nm的互连大孔。
2. 大孔体积和高比表面积：丰富且完全互连的大孔。
3. 分层孔结构：由直径80 nm的墨水瓶颈状通道连接的大孔矩阵。
4. 良好分散的活性位点：三配位表面硼物种被确定为活性催化位点。
5. 定制的电子性质：硼位点的不同配位环境（三配位vs四配位）影响其电子密度和结合性质。

这些特征通过以下方式增强催化性能：

1. 改善质量传输并减少扩散限制。
2. 暴露更多的活性位点。
3. 使反应位点更容易接触，特别是在高空速条件下。
4. 允许在较低反应温度下实现相同的转化率。
5. 由于动力学扩散增强，大大提高产率。
6. 在催化反应过程中提供稳定性。

将B活性组分引入这些结构的主要方法是使用硬模板法进行水热辅助合成。这种方法包括：

1. 使用硼酸作为硼源。
2. 使用聚苯并恶嗪聚合物球体作为模板来创建有序的大孔结构。
3. 煅烧以去除模板并形成最终的BPO4结构。

这种方法特别适用于创建具有增强性能的无金属氧化物催化剂，用于氧化脱氢反应。它允许精确控制孔隙大小、互连性和活性位点分散。

这种方法对不同催化应用的有效性各不相同：

1. 对于需要改善质量传递和活性位点高可及性的反应（如丙烷的氧化脱氢）非常有效。
2. 对于不受扩散限制或需要不同类型活性位点的反应可能不太有利。
3. 高比表面积、可接触活性位点和结构稳定性之间的平衡是实现高催化生产力和选择性的关键。

总的来说，这种方法在创建具有定制性能的催化剂方面显示出前景，但其对不同催化应用的有效性应该根据具体情况进行评估。
