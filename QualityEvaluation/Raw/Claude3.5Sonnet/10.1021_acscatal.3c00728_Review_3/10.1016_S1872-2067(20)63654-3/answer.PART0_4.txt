[1] "Ordered macroporous materials have an extremely favorable architecture, which can improve mass transport, reduce diffusion limitations, and expose a large number of active sites"

[2] "BPO4(OM) exhibited a productivity of 16 golefin gcat1 h1. This value was remarkably higher than that of the BPO4(bulk) (1.2 golefin gcat1 h1) and of the reported catalysts"

[3] "The interconnected macropores of the BPO4(OM) sample were formed through the inverse templating effect of the polybenzoxazine polymer spheres, consisting of a matrix of macropores bridged by ink-bottle neck-like channels of 80 nm in diameter."

[4] "The presence of the excess electron density in its vicinity is expected to perturb the binding strength of 1s electron and shift the bind energy to a lower value. The tetra-coordinated boron species represented the transition region to extend the bulk structure to the surface."

[5] "The tri-coordinated B site has less electron density in its vicinity than the tetra-coordinated B site since in these species B always remained with a former oxidation state of +3, which was neutralized when being tri-coordinated while felt excess negative charge when tetra-coordinated."

The 3-D dispersed active sites in porous B-based materials significantly enhance catalytic performance through several structural characteristics:

1. Improved mass transport and reduced diffusion limitations due to the ordered macroporous architecture. This allows reactants to access active sites more easily and products to diffuse away quickly.

2. Increased exposure of active sites. The porous structure provides a larger surface area, exposing more active sites for catalysis.

3. Enhanced stability. The interconnected framework of macropores bridged by smaller channels creates a robust structure that maintains catalytic activity over time.

4. Tailored electronic properties. The coordination environment of boron sites (tri- vs tetra-coordinated) influences their electron density and binding properties, which can be optimized for specific catalytic applications.

The main method used to incorporate B active components in this study was hydrothermal-assisted synthesis using a hard template approach. This method proved effective for creating an ordered macroporous structure with well-dispersed active sites. The use of polybenzoxazine polymer spheres as templates allowed for precise control over pore size and interconnectivity.

This approach is particularly effective for oxidative dehydrogenation reactions, where mass transfer and heat dissipation are crucial. However, its effectiveness may vary for other catalytic applications. For reactions less sensitive to diffusion limitations, simpler synthesis methods might suffice.

The critical factor in this method's success is its ability to create a high surface area material with accessible active sites while maintaining structural stability. This balance is key to achieving high catalytic productivity and selectivity.

B基多孔材料中的三维分散活性位点通过以下结构特征显著提高了催化性能：

1. 有序大孔结构改善了质量传输并减少了扩散限制。这使反应物更容易接触到活性位点，产物也能快速扩散。

2. 增加了活性位点的暴露。多孔结构提供了更大的表面积，暴露出更多的催化活性位点。

3. 增强稳定性。由小通道连接的大孔互连框架形成了一个稳固的结构，能长期保持催化活性。

4. 定制的电子性质。硼位点的配位环境（三配位与四配位）影响其电子密度和结合性质，可针对特定催化应用进行优化。

本研究中用于引入B活性组分的主要方法是利用硬模板法进行水热辅助合成。这种方法在创建具有均匀分散活性位点的有序大孔结构方面证明是有效的。使用聚苯并恶嗪聚合物球体作为模板，可以精确控制孔隙大小和互连性。

这种方法对于氧化脱氢反应特别有效，因为在这类反应中质量传递和热量耗散至关重要。然而，对于其他催化应用，其有效性可能会有所不同。对于扩散限制不那么敏感的反应，可能更简单的合成方法就足够了。

这种方法成功的关键在于它能够创造出具有可接触活性位点的高比表面积材料，同时保持结构稳定性。这种平衡是实现高催化生产力和选择性的关键。
