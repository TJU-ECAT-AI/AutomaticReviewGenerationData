The 3-D dispersed active sites in porous B-based materials significantly enhance catalytic performance through several structural characteristics:

1. Improved mass transport: The ordered macroporous structure facilitates better diffusion of reactants and products throughout the catalyst.

2. Reduced diffusion limitations: Interconnected macropores with large volumes allow for easier access to active sites, especially under high space velocity conditions.

3. Increased active site exposure: The porous framework exposes a larger number of active sites compared to bulk materials.

4. Structural stability: The ordered macroporous BPO4 framework exhibits remarkable stability during catalytic reactions.

The main method used to incorporate B active components into these structures is hydrothermal-assisted synthesis using a hard template (polybenzoxazine polymer spheres). This approach effectively creates an inverse replica of the template, resulting in interconnected macropores with an average diameter of 200 nm.

The effectiveness of this method for catalytic applications is demonstrated by:

1. Higher catalytic activity: BPO4(OM) showed significantly better performance than BPO4(bulk) in the oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of propane.

2. Increased productivity: The ordered macroporous structure allowed for much higher olefin productivity compared to bulk materials and other reported catalysts.

3. Enhanced selectivity: The catalyst maintained high selectivity for desired products (propene and ethene) while minimizing unwanted deep oxidation products.

4. Stability: The structure remained stable during long-term catalytic testing.

The tri-coordinated surface boron species were identified as the active catalytic sites, with their content increasing during the reaction. This suggests that the method is effective in creating and maintaining the desired active sites for ODH reactions.

While this approach has proven highly effective for the ODH of propane, its relative effectiveness for other catalytic applications would require further investigation. However, the principles of improved mass transport and increased active site accessibility are likely to be beneficial in various catalytic processes, particularly those involving gas-phase reactions or diffusion-limited systems.

基于B的材料中的3D分散活性位点通过几个结构特征显著提高了催化性能：

1. 改善的质量传输：有序的大孔结构有助于反应物和产物在整个催化剂中更好地扩散。

2. 减少扩散限制：大体积的互连大孔使活性位点更容易被接触到，特别是在高空速条件下。

3. 增加活性位点暴露：与块状材料相比，多孔框架暴露了更多的活性位点。

4. 结构稳定性：有序大孔BPO4框架在催化反应过程中表现出显著的稳定性。

将B活性组分引入这些结构的主要方法是使用硬模板（聚苯并恶嗪聚合物球）进行水热辅助合成。这种方法有效地创造了模板的反向复制品，形成了平均直径为200nm的互连大孔。

这种方法对催化应用的有效性体现在：

1. 更高的催化活性：在丙烷的氧化脱氢（ODH）反应中，BPO4(OM)比BPO4(bulk)表现出显著更好的性能。

2. 提高的生产力：有序大孔结构允许比块状材料和其他报道的催化剂具有更高的烯烃生产力。

3. 增强的选择性：催化剂保持了对目标产物（丙烯和乙烯）的高选择性，同时最小化了不需要的深度氧化产物。

4. 稳定性：在长期催化测试中，结构保持稳定。

三配位表面硼物种被确定为活性催化位点，其含量在反应过程中增加。这表明该方法在创建和维持ODH反应所需的活性位点方面是有效的。

虽然这种方法已被证明对丙烷的ODH非常有效，但对其他催化应用的相对有效性还需要进一步研究。然而，改善的质量传输和增加的活性位点可及性原则可能对各种催化过程都有益，特别是涉及气相反应或扩散限制系统的过程。
