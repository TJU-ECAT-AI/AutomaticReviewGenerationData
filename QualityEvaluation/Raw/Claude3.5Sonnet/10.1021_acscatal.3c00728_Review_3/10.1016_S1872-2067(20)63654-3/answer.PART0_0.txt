The structural characteristics of B-based materials with 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks include:

1. Ordered macroporous structure with interconnected pores
2. Large pore volume and high surface area
3. Inverse replica of the template used in synthesis
4. Tri-coordinated boron species as active sites

These features enhance catalytic performance by:

1. Improving mass transport and reducing diffusion limitations
2. Exposing a higher number of active sites
3. Enabling better accessibility to reactive sites
4. Allowing for lower reaction temperatures to achieve equivalent conversion
5. Greatly improving yield due to enhanced kinetic diffusion

The method used to incorporate B active components into these structures was hydrothermal-assisted synthesis followed by calcination. This method appears to be effective for creating ordered macroporous BPO4 with well-dispersed active sites for oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of propane. The effectiveness of this method for other catalytic applications would depend on the specific reaction requirements and desired catalyst properties.

This approach is particularly beneficial for diffusion-limited reaction processes and high-temperature oxidative reactions. However, its effectiveness may vary for different catalytic applications depending on factors such as:

1. Required pore size and distribution
2. Nature of active sites needed
3. Thermal and chemical stability requirements
4. Specific mass transfer and diffusion needs of the reaction

Overall, this method shows promise for creating metal-free oxide catalysts with enhanced performance, but further research would be needed to evaluate its effectiveness across a broader range of catalytic applications.

具有3D分散活性位点的B基材料在多孔框架中的结构特征包括：

1. 有序的大孔结构，孔洞互连
2. 大孔体积和高比表面积
3. 合成中使用的模板的反向复制
4. 三配位硼物种作为活性位点

这些特征通过以下方式增强催化性能：

1. 改善质量传递并减少扩散限制
2. 暴露更多的活性位点
3. 提高反应位点的可及性
4. 在较低反应温度下实现相同的转化率
5. 由于动力学扩散增强，大大提高产率

将B活性组分结合到这些结构中的方法是水热辅助合成，然后进行煅烧。这种方法似乎对于创建具有良好分散活性位点的有序大孔BPO4非常有效，适用于丙烷的氧化脱氢（ODH）。这种方法对其他催化应用的有效性将取决于特定的反应要求和所需的催化剂性质。

这种方法特别有利于扩散受限的反应过程和高温氧化反应。然而，其对不同催化应用的有效性可能会因以下因素而异：

1. 所需的孔隙大小和分布
2. 所需活性位点的性质
3. 热稳定性和化学稳定性要求
4. 反应的特定质量传递和扩散需求

总的来说，这种方法在创建具有增强性能的无金属氧化物催化剂方面显示出前景，但需要进一步研究以评估其在更广泛的催化应用范围内的有效性。
