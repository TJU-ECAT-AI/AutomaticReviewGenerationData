[1] "Ordered macroporous materials have an extremely favorable architecture, which can improve mass transport, reduce diffusion limitations, and expose a large number of active sites"

[2] "BPO4(OM) exhibited a productivity of 16 golefin gcat1 h1. This value was remarkably higher than that of the BPO4(bulk) (1.2 golefin gcat1 h1) and of the reported catalysts (Table S1) used in the ODH process"

[3] "The interconnected macropores of the BPO4(OM) sample were formed through the inverse templating effect of the polybenzoxazine polymer spheres, consisting of a matrix of macropores bridged by ink-bottle neck-like channels of 80 nm in diameter."

[4] "The tri-coordinated surface boron species were identified as the active catalytic sites for the ODH of propane."

[5] "The content of tri-coordinated surface boron species increased from ca. 41% in fresh BPO4(OM) to 51% in the spent catalyst (Table S3). These results likely indicate that the tri-coordinated boron species were responsible for the ODH of propane."

The structural characteristics of B-based materials with 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks include:

1. Ordered macroporous structure that improves mass transport and reduces diffusion limitations
2. Interconnected macropores formed through inverse templating
3. High exposure of active sites, particularly tri-coordinated boron species

These features enhance catalytic performance by:

1. Facilitating rapid mass transfer to and from active sites
2. Providing a large number of accessible active sites
3. Allowing for higher conversion rates and productivity compared to bulk materials

The method used to incorporate B active components into these structures was hydrothermal-assisted synthesis using boric acid as the boron source and polybenzoxazine polymer spheres as templates. This method proved effective for creating an ordered macroporous BPO4 framework with well-dispersed active sites.

The effectiveness of this approach for catalytic applications is demonstrated by:

1. Significantly higher olefin productivity compared to bulk BPO4 and other reported catalysts
2. Improved mass transfer and accessibility of active sites under high space velocity conditions
3. Excellent structural stability during the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane

While this method has shown great promise for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane, its effectiveness for other catalytic applications would need to be evaluated on a case-by-case basis. The approach may be particularly suitable for reactions that benefit from improved mass transfer and high accessibility of active sites.

具有三维分散活性位点的B基材料在多孔框架中的结构特征包括：

1. 有序的大孔结构，可改善质量传输并减少扩散限制
2. 通过反向模板形成的相互连接的大孔
3. 活性位点高度暴露，特别是三配位硼物种

这些特征通过以下方式增强催化性能：

1. 促进活性位点之间的快速物质传递
2. 提供大量可接触的活性位点
3. 与块状材料相比，允许更高的转化率和生产力

将B活性成分引入这些结构的方法是使用硼酸作为硼源和聚苯并恶嗪聚合物球体作为模板的水热辅助合成。这种方法被证明可有效创建具有良好分散活性位点的有序大孔BPO4框架。

这种方法对催化应用的有效性通过以下方面得到证明：

1. 与块状BPO4和其他报道的催化剂相比，烯烃生产力显著提高
2. 在高空速条件下改善了质量传递和活性位点的可及性
3. 在丙烷氧化脱氢过程中表现出优异的结构稳定性

虽然这种方法在丙烷氧化脱氢方面表现出巨大潜力，但对其他催化应用的有效性需要逐案评估。这种方法可能特别适用于受益于改善质量传递和活性位点高可及性的反应。
