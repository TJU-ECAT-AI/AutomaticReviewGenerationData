Abstract
Borosilicate zeolites are the active catalysts in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP), which provide an ideal platform to explore the origin of catalytic activity for boron-containing catalysts as well as the construction of highly active boron centers. Herein, we report that the incompletely crystallized MFI-type borosilicate zeolite catalyst displays extraordinary performance in ODHP, exhibiting an olefin productivity of 4.75 golefin gcat1 h1 under low reaction temperature (445 C) and high weight-hour-space-velocity (WHSV, 37.6 gC3H8 gcat1 h1). A combination of solid-state NMR, dual-beam FTIR, and in-situ DRIFT measurements reveal that the boron species are anchored to the zeolite matrix in the form of open coordination. Meanwhile, the ample SiOH groups on the surface facilitate the formation of hydrogen bonds with the BOH in defective boron species and inhibit the excessive leaching of boron. During the ODHP process, the isolated boron species would dynamically transform into aggregated ones, being closely related to the increased catalytic activity. The BOH groups in aggregated BOx species that hydrogen bond with adjacent SiOH groups are identified as the active center and high efficiency in catalyzing ODHP reaction at low temperature.

1. Introduction
Boron-containing materials generally showed immense potential in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane owing to their superior catalytic activity and high selectivity to olefin, particularly by avoiding the deep oxidation reaction of olefin

. Nevertheless, increasing boron loading for supported catalysts is an straightforward route to create more active sites for the ODH reactions
[11]

[12]

[19]

[20]
. Hence, it is highly desirable to establish a way to prepare boron-containing catalysts with well-dispersed and accessible active boron species.
Borosilicate zeolites with homogeneous distribution of boron have been proved as the promising catalyst in ODHP reaction and the micro-environment of boron species is the dominant factor for the catalytic properties
[14]
,
[21]
. The isolated B(OSi)3 units that are fully incorporated into the zeolite framework are confirmed inactive for ODHP reaction over B-MWW zeolite
[22]
. On the contrary, the defect boron sites are of the essence in catalyzing the ODHP reaction, and the aggregated boron species are more efficient in CH bond activation of propane than the isolated species
[14]
,
[22]
. Lately, the isolated boron (B[OHO(H)Si]2) in borosilicate MFI-type zeolite shows superior durability with olefin productivity of 0.2 golefin gcat1 h1, and the hydrogen bond formed between BOH with adjacent SiOH facilitates the synergistic conversion of oxygen and propane
[21]
. While a higher reaction temperature (up to 560 C) is required to achieve substantial olefin productivity over such isolated boron sites. Our previous work shows that the boroxol ring and the tri-coordinated planar BO3/2 species in BOS (B2O3/SBA-15) catalysts are responsible for the low-temperature ODHP reaction and boron sites with more OH groups are easier to dehydrogenate by dioxygen
[12]
. In the view of the micro-environment of boron species on the zeolite catalysts, enabling boron species to be uniformly anchored to hydroxyl-rich MFI-type zeolite matrix in oligomeric form may be a feasible way to construct highly active boron centers.
In this work, a series of boron-containing MFI-type zeolite (BMFI) catalysts with different crystallinity and well-dispersed boron species were prepared, and investigated for catalyzing the ODHP reaction. The crystallinity was regulated by adjusting the hydrothermal synthesis conditions. It turned out to be that the catalysts with low crystallinity exhibited superior activity and higher productivity of olefin at low temperature. Structure characterizations revealed that the incomplete crystallization could enrich the defect boron sites with hydrogen bonded to adjacent silanols, which were responsible for the superior catalytic activity of the BMFI catalysts.
2. Experimental methods
2.1. Synthesis of BMFI catalysts
The BMFI zeolites were synthesized according to an earlier report with slight modifications
[23]
. 0.433 g boric acid (Sinopharm) was dissolved in 4.8 g aqueous solution of tetrapropylammonium hydroxide (TPAOH, 25 wt%, Guangfu) and 24 mL deionized water with stirring at room temperature. Then, 2.5 g nano fumed silica (Aladdin) was slowed added to the mixture and strongly stirred for an hour to obtain a gel with a molar composition of 1SiO2: 0.084B2O3: 0.1TPAOH: 36H2O. The gel was sealed into a 50 mL Teflon-lined stainless-steel autoclave and subjected to hydrothermal treatment at 150 C statically for several days to obtain the zeolites with different crystallinity. After cooling down to room temperature, the product was filtered, dried, and finally calcined at 550 C in air for 6 h to remove the templating agent. The samples were labeled as BMFI-x, x for the time in hydrothermal treatment (days). The BMFI-3.0-AT was prepared by stirring 500 mg BMFI-3.0 in 10 mL nitric acid (15 mol/L) at 80 C for 5 h. After cooling down to room temperature, the product was filtered, washed, dried at 120 C, and finally calcined at 550 C in air for 2 h.
2.2. Catalyst characterizations
The actual boron content of the zeolites was measured by inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES) on Optima2000DV. Before the measurements, the sample (10 mg) was dissolved by hydrochloric acid (1 mL) and hydrofluoric acid (1 mL) mixed solution in a Teflon-lined autoclave at 150 C for 1.5 h. After evaporating up the solution that contained hydrochloric acid and hydrofluoric acid, we repeatedly added deionized water into the Teflon container and then collected the solution into a polypropylene volumetric flask, finally fixed the solution volume as 25 mL.
The powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) was recorded on PANalytical XPert3 Powder diffractometer using Cu Kα radiation (λ = 0.15406 nm). The zeolite powder was placed inside a quartz-glass sample holder for testing. The tube voltage was 40 kV, and the current was 40 mA, and the relative crystallinity of BMFI was calculated based on the area of the peaks of angle 2θ = 2225.
N2 adsorptiondesorption isotherms were measured with an ASAP 3000 sorption analyzer (Micromeritics). Prior to the measurement, the sample was degassed by evacuation at 200 C for 4 h. The Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) method was used to calculate the specific surface area (SBET). Total pore volume (Vtotal) was calculated from the amount of gas adsorbed at a relative pressure P/P0 of 0.99. Micropore volume (Vmicro) was calculated using the t-plot method.
Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) spectra were recorded on a Nicolet 6700 FT-IR spectrometer equipped with a mercury cadmium telluride (MCT) detector. The evolutions in the hydroxyl regions under different temperatures were monitored by dual-beam Fourier transform infrared spectrometry (DB-FTIR) with a Nicolet 10 FTIR spectrometer. The spectra were processed by subtracting from the measured sample spectra a background spectrum recorded in an empty IR cell in the absence of the catalyst. In-situ Diffuse Reflectance Infrared Fourier Transform (DRIFT) spectra were collected on a Bruker 70 V spectrometer equipped with an in-situ reaction cell (HARRICK) and MCT detector. The catalyst powder (30 mg) was placed in the cell and pretreated at 500 C for 3 h in a flow of 30 vol% O2/N2. Subsequently, the sample was maintained at 450 C in flowing C3H8/O2/N2 (volume ratio of 1:1.5:3.5) gas mixture. The evolution of surface species was monitored by IR by averaging 256 scans at a resolution of 4 cm1.
11B MAS NMR spectra were recorded on an Agilent DD2-500 MHz spectrometer with an 11.7 T magnet, using a 4-mm MAS NMR probe with a spinning rate of 10 kHz. The spectra were acquired with 600 scans per increment, a recycle delay of 3 s. The pulse length and power were 0.425 μs and 53. Chemical shifts were referenced to a 1 M H3BO3 aqueous solution at 19.6 ppm. The DMFIT program was used to deconvolute the spectra and fit the peaks
[24]
. The peak areas represented the number of nuclear spins, i.e., the content of corresponding B species; therefore, the relative amount of B species in each spectrum could be derived. The BMFI catalysts were stored after reactions under an inert atmosphere and packed into NMR rotors, and then conducted measurements at room temperature.
1H MAS NMR experiments were carried out at 499.8 MHz using a 4 mm MAS NMR probe with a spinning rate of 10 kHz, 64 scans, and 4 s pulse delay. The pulse length and power were 2.6 μs and 61. Hexafluoroisopropanol was used as the standard sample for 1H MAS NMR quantification. The chemical shifts were referenced to tetramethylsilane. Prior to measurement, the sample was dehydrated at 400 C for 10 h at 104 Pa and then transferred to a 4 mm MAS rotor in a glove box without exposure to air.
2.3. Catalytic reaction
Selective oxidation of propane studied in a fixed bed reactor (I. D. = 8 mm, length = 42 cm) packed with 50 mg catalyst (the height of catalyst bed is 3 mm) and heated to 400550 C under atmospheric pressure. The feed gas contains C3H8/O2/N2 with a volume ratio of 1:1.5:3.5 at a fixed total flow rate of 96 mL/min. Before reaction, each BMFI catalyst was pretreated to stabilize the coordination environment of boron species under reaction conditions. Reactants and products were analyzed using an online gas chromatograph (Techcomp, GC 7980) equipped with a GDX-102 and molecular sieve 5A column. A TCD was used to detect O2, N2, C3H8, C3H6, C2H4, CO, and CO2. The conversion was defined as the number of moles of carbon converted divided by the number of moles of carbon present in the feed. Selectivity was defined as the number of moles of carbon in the product divided by the number of moles of carbon reacted. The turnover frequency (TOF) was calculated based on the hypothesis that B[3]a were the active sites. The quantity of B[3]a species was calculated from the results of 11B MAS NMR spectra and ICP-OES. The carbon balance was checked by comparing the number of moles of carbon in the outlet stream to the number of moles of carbon in the feed. Under our typical evaluating conditions, the carbon balance was generally higher than 95%.
The mass and heat transfer diffusion limitation have been ruled out for the highest propane reaction rate based on Weisz-Prater criterion and Mears criterion
