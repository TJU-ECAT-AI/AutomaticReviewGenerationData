[1] "Borosilicate zeolites are the active catalysts in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP), which provide an ideal platform to explore the origin of catalytic activity for boron-containing catalysts as well as the construction of highly active boron centers."

[2] "The incompletely crystallized MFI-type borosilicate zeolite catalyst displays extraordinary performance in ODHP, exhibiting an olefin productivity of 4.75 golefin gcat1 h1 under low reaction temperature (445 C) and high weight-hour-space-velocity (WHSV, 37.6 gC3H8 gcat1 h1)."

[3] "A combination of solid-state NMR, dual-beam FTIR, and in-situ DRIFT measurements reveal that the boron species are anchored to the zeolite matrix in the form of open coordination."

[4] "The ample SiOH groups on the surface facilitate the formation of hydrogen bonds with the BOH in defective boron species and inhibit the excessive leaching of boron."

[5] "The BOH groups in aggregated BOx species that hydrogen bond with adjacent SiOH groups are identified as the active center and high efficiency in catalyzing ODHP reaction at low temperature."

[6] "Enabling boron species to be uniformly anchored to hydroxyl-rich MFI-type zeolite matrix in oligomeric form may be a feasible way to construct highly active boron centers."

[7] "The crystallinity was regulated by adjusting the hydrothermal synthesis conditions. It turned out to be that the catalysts with low crystallinity exhibited superior activity and higher productivity of olefin at low temperature."

B-based materials with 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks, such as borosilicate zeolites, exhibit enhanced catalytic performance due to several structural characteristics:

1. Open coordination: Boron species are anchored to the zeolite matrix in an open coordination form, allowing for better accessibility of reactants to the active sites.

2. Hydrogen bonding: The presence of ample SiOH groups on the surface facilitates the formation of hydrogen bonds with BOH in defective boron species. This interaction not only stabilizes the boron species but also creates active centers for catalysis.

3. Defect-rich structure: Incompletely crystallized zeolites with low crystallinity exhibit superior catalytic activity and higher olefin productivity at low temperatures. This is attributed to the enrichment of defect boron sites in these structures.

4. Uniform dispersion: Boron species are uniformly anchored to the hydroxyl-rich MFI-type zeolite matrix, ensuring a homogeneous distribution of active sites throughout the catalyst.

5. Oligomeric form: The boron species exist in an oligomeric form, which contributes to the construction of highly active boron centers.

The methods used to incorporate B active components into these structures include:

1. Hydrothermal synthesis: The crystallinity of the zeolite is regulated by adjusting hydrothermal synthesis conditions, allowing for control over the formation of defect boron sites.

2. Post-synthesis modification: Techniques such as acid treatment (e.g., BMFI-3.0-AT) can be used to modify the boron species' coordination environment and enhance catalytic performance.

These methods are effective for catalytic applications such as oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP), where the resulting catalysts show extraordinary performance at low reaction temperatures and high weight-hour-space-velocity. The hydrothermal synthesis method appears to be particularly effective in creating catalysts with low crystallinity and enriched defect boron sites, which exhibit superior activity in ODHP reactions.

However, the effectiveness of these methods may vary for different catalytic applications. For reactions that require different types of active sites or operating conditions, alternative incorporation methods or modifications to the existing techniques may be necessary to optimize catalyst performance.

具有三维分散活性位点的B基多孔框架材料，如硼硅分子筛，由于以下结构特征而表现出增强的催化性能：

1. 开放配位：硼物种以开放配位形式锚定在分子筛骨架上，使反应物能更好地接触活性位点。

2. 氢键作用：表面上丰富的SiOH基团有助于与缺陷硼物种中的BOH形成氢键。这种相互作用不仅稳定了硼物种，还创造了催化活性中心。

3. 富缺陷结构：结晶度低的不完全结晶分子筛在低温下表现出优越的催化活性和更高的烯烃生产率。这归因于这些结构中缺陷硼位点的富集。

4. 均匀分散：硼物种均匀地锚定在富含羟基的MFI型分子筛骨架上，确保活性位点在整个催化剂中均匀分布。

5. 寡聚体形式：硼物种以寡聚体形式存在，有助于构建高活性硼中心。

将B活性组分引入这些结构的方法包括：

1. 水热合成：通过调节水热合成条件来调控分子筛的结晶度，从而控制缺陷硼位点的形成。

2. 后合成修饰：使用酸处理等技术（如BMFI-3.0-AT）可以修改硼物种的配位环境，提高催化性能。

这些方法对丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）等催化应用非常有效，所得催化剂在低反应温度和高重时空速下表现出卓越的性能。水热合成方法在创造低结晶度和富集缺陷硼位点的催化剂方面特别有效，这些催化剂在ODHP反应中表现出优越的活性。

然而，这些方法的有效性可能因催化应用的不同而有所差异。对于需要不同类型活性位点或操作条件的反应，可能需要替代的引入方法或对现有技术进行修改，以优化催化剂性能。
