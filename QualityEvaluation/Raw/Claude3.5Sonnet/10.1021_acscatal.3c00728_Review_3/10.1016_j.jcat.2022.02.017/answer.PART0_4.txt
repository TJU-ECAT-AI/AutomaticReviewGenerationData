[1] "Borosilicate zeolites are the active catalysts in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP), which provide an ideal platform to explore the origin of catalytic activity for boron-containing catalysts as well as the construction of highly active boron centers."

[2] "The incompletely crystallized MFI-type borosilicate zeolite catalyst displays extraordinary performance in ODHP, exhibiting an olefin productivity of 4.75 golefin gcat1 h1 under low reaction temperature (445 C) and high weight-hour-space-velocity (WHSV, 37.6 gC3H8 gcat1 h1)."

[3] "A combination of solid-state NMR, dual-beam FTIR, and in-situ DRIFT measurements reveal that the boron species are anchored to the zeolite matrix in the form of open coordination."

[4] "The ample SiOH groups on the surface facilitate the formation of hydrogen bonds with the BOH in defective boron species and inhibit the excessive leaching of boron."

[5] "During the ODHP process, the isolated boron species would dynamically transform into aggregated ones, being closely related to the increased catalytic activity."

[6] "The BOH groups in aggregated BOx species that hydrogen bond with adjacent SiOH groups are identified as the active center and high efficiency in catalyzing ODHP reaction at low temperature."

B-based materials with 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks, such as borosilicate zeolites, exhibit several structural characteristics that enhance catalytic performance:

1. Open coordination: Boron species are anchored to the zeolite matrix in an open coordination form, allowing for better accessibility to reactants.

2. Defective boron sites: The presence of defective boron species with BOH groups enables the formation of hydrogen bonds with adjacent SiOH groups on the zeolite surface.

3. Dynamic transformation: During the catalytic process, isolated boron species can transform into aggregated ones, which is associated with increased catalytic activity.

4. Porous structure: The MFI-type zeolite framework provides a high surface area and well-dispersed active sites throughout the 3-D structure.

These structural features enhance catalytic performance by:

1. Increasing the number of accessible active sites
2. Facilitating the formation of hydrogen bonds, which play a crucial role in the catalytic process
3. Allowing for dynamic changes in boron species during the reaction, optimizing catalytic activity
4. Providing a stable environment for boron species, preventing excessive leaching

Methods used to incorporate B active components into these structures include:

1. Hydrothermal synthesis: Adjusting crystallization conditions to obtain incompletely crystallized MFI-type borosilicate zeolites with enriched defect boron sites.

2. Post-synthesis modification: Acid treatment of synthesized zeolites to modify the coordination environment of boron species.

The effectiveness of these methods depends on the specific catalytic application:

1. For oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP), the incompletely crystallized MFI-type borosilicate zeolite catalyst shows excellent performance at low temperatures and high space velocities.

2. The acid treatment method can be used to fine-tune the boron species' coordination environment, potentially optimizing the catalyst for different reactions.

In conclusion, the incorporation of B active components into 3-D porous frameworks creates materials with unique structural characteristics that significantly enhance catalytic performance. The choice of incorporation method should be based on the desired catalytic application and the specific properties required for optimal performance.
