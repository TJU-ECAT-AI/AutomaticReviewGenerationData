Borosilicate zeolites with 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks enhance catalytic performance in several ways:

1. Ideal platform for exploring catalytic activity: The borosilicate zeolite structure provides an excellent environment to study the origin of catalytic activity for boron-containing catalysts and construct highly active boron centers.

2. Defect boron sites are crucial: Unlike fully incorporated B(OSi)3 units, which are inactive, defect boron sites are essential for catalyzing reactions like oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP).

3. Aggregated boron species are more efficient: In CH bond activation of propane, aggregated boron species show higher efficiency compared to isolated species.

4. Hydrogen bonding enhances activity: The formation of hydrogen bonds between BOH and adjacent SiOH groups facilitates synergistic conversion of oxygen and propane, improving catalytic performance.

5. Uniform anchoring in oligomeric form: Anchoring boron species uniformly to hydroxyl-rich zeolite matrices in oligomeric form is a promising approach to construct highly active boron centers.

Methods used to incorporate B active components and their effectiveness:

1. Incomplete crystallization: This method enriches defect boron sites with hydrogen bonding to adjacent silanols, resulting in superior catalytic activity. It is particularly effective for reactions like ODHP.

2. Hydrothermal synthesis with boric acid: This approach allows for the incorporation of boron into the zeolite framework during synthesis. The effectiveness can be modulated by adjusting synthesis conditions such as temperature and duration.

3. Post-synthesis modification: Although not explicitly mentioned in the given text, this method is often used to introduce boron into existing zeolite structures. Its effectiveness may vary depending on the specific zeolite and desired boron distribution.

4. Control of boron speciation: By carefully controlling synthesis conditions, it's possible to favor the formation of specific boron species (isolated, aggregated, or oligomeric) within the zeolite structure. This method's effectiveness depends on the target reaction and desired catalytic properties.

The effectiveness of these methods can vary depending on the specific catalytic application. For ODHP reactions, methods that promote the formation of defect boron sites and aggregated boron species appear to be more effective. However, for other applications requiring high durability, methods that produce isolated boron species might be preferred.

含有三维分散活性位点的B基多孔框架材料在结构上增强催化性能的几个方面：

1. 理想的催化活性研究平台：硼硅分子筛结构为研究含硼催化剂的催化活性起源和构建高活性硼中心提供了优秀的环境。

2. 缺陷硼位点至关重要：与完全并入框架的B(OSi)3单元不同，缺陷硼位点对催化反应（如丙烷的氧化脱氢（ODHP））至关重要。

3. 聚集态硼物种效率更高：在丙烷C-H键活化中，聚集态硼物种比孤立态硼物种显示出更高的效率。

4. 氢键增强活性：B-OH与相邻Si-OH基团之间形成的氢键有利于氧气和丙烷的协同转化，提高催化性能。

5. 寡聚体形式的均匀锚定：将硼物种以寡聚体形式均匀锚定到富羟基的分子筛基质上是构建高活性硼中心的一种有前景的方法。

用于引入B活性组分的方法及其有效性：

1. 不完全结晶：这种方法能富集与相邻硅醇基形成氢键的缺陷硼位点，从而获得优异的催化活性。这对ODHP等反应特别有效。

2. 硼酸水热合成：这种方法允许在合成过程中将硼并入分子筛骨架。其有效性可以通过调整合成条件（如温度和持续时间）来调节。

3. 后合成修饰：虽然在给定文本中没有明确提到，但这种方法经常用于向现有分子筛结构中引入硼。其有效性可能因特定的分子筛和所需的硼分布而异。

4. 控制硼物种形态：通过仔细控制合成条件，可以在分子筛结构中优先形成特定的硼物种（孤立态、聚集态或寡聚态）。这种方法的有效性取决于目标反应和所需的催化性能。

这些方法的有效性可能因特定的催化应用而异。对于ODHP反应，促进缺陷硼位点和聚集态硼物种形成的方法似乎更有效。然而，对于其他需要高耐久性的应用，产生孤立态硼物种的方法可能更受青睐。
