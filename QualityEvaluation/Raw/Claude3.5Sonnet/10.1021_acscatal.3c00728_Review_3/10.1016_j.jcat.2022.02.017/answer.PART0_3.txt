[1] "Borosilicate zeolites are the active catalysts in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP), which provide an ideal platform to explore the origin of catalytic activity for boron-containing catalysts as well as the construction of highly active boron centers."

[2] "The incompletely crystallized MFI-type borosilicate zeolite catalyst displays extraordinary performance in ODHP, exhibiting an olefin productivity of 4.75 golefin gcat1 h1 under low reaction temperature (445 C) and high weight-hour-space-velocity (WHSV, 37.6 gC3H8 gcat1 h1)."

[3] "A combination of solid-state NMR, dual-beam FTIR, and in-situ DRIFT measurements reveal that the boron species are anchored to the zeolite matrix in the form of open coordination."

[4] "The ample SiOH groups on the surface facilitate the formation of hydrogen bonds with the BOH in defective boron species and inhibit the excessive leaching of boron."

[5] "During the ODHP process, the isolated boron species would dynamically transform into aggregated ones, being closely related to the increased catalytic activity."

[6] "The BOH groups in aggregated BOx species that hydrogen bond with adjacent SiOH groups are identified as the active center and high efficiency in catalyzing ODHP reaction at low temperature."

The structural characteristics of B-based materials with 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks, such as borosilicate zeolites, enhance catalytic performance through several key features:

1. Open coordination: Boron species are anchored to the zeolite matrix in an open coordination form, allowing for better accessibility of reactants to the active sites.

2. Defective boron sites: The presence of defective boron species, particularly those with BOH groups, contributes to increased catalytic activity.

3. Hydrogen bonding: The ample SiOH groups on the surface form hydrogen bonds with BOH in defective boron species, which helps stabilize the active sites and prevent excessive boron leaching.

4. Dynamic transformation: During the catalytic process, isolated boron species can transform into aggregated ones, leading to increased catalytic activity.

5. Low-temperature activity: The structural features enable efficient catalysis at relatively low temperatures, as demonstrated by the high olefin productivity at 445°C.

Methods used to incorporate B active components into these structures include:

1. Hydrothermal synthesis: The study describes the synthesis of BMFI zeolites using a hydrothermal method, which allows for control over crystallinity and boron incorporation.

2. Crystallinity modulation: By adjusting the hydrothermal synthesis conditions, the researchers were able to create incompletely crystallized MFI-type borosilicate zeolites with enhanced catalytic performance.

3. Post-synthesis acid treatment: The study mentions the preparation of BMFI-3.0-AT by treating BMFI-3.0 with nitric acid, which may be used to modify the boron species' environment.

The effectiveness of these methods varies depending on the catalytic application. For oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP), the incompletely crystallized zeolites showed superior performance, indicating that the hydrothermal synthesis method with controlled crystallinity is particularly effective for this application. The creation of defective boron sites and the presence of hydrogen-bonding SiOH groups appear to be crucial for enhancing catalytic activity in ODHP reactions.

However, the study primarily focuses on ODHP, so the relative effectiveness of these methods for other catalytic applications cannot be fully assessed based on the given information. Further research would be needed to evaluate their efficacy in different catalytic processes.

具有三维分散活性位点的B基材料在多孔框架中的结构特征通过以下几个关键特性增强了催化性能：

1. 开放配位：硼物种以开放配位形式锚定在沸石基质上，使反应物更容易接近活性位点。

2. 缺陷硼位点：存在缺陷硼物种，特别是含有BOH基团的物种，有助于提高催化活性。

3. 氢键作用：表面上丰富的SiOH基团与缺陷硼物种中的BOH形成氢键，有助于稳定活性位点并防止过度的硼流失。

4. 动态转化：在催化过程中，孤立的硼物种可以转化为聚集态，导致催化活性增加。

5. 低温活性：这些结构特征使得在相对较低的温度下能够进行高效催化，如在445°C下展现出高烯烃生产率。

将B活性组分引入这些结构的方法包括：

1. 水热合成：研究描述了使用水热方法合成BMFI沸石，该方法允许控制结晶度和硼的掺入。

2. 结晶度调控：通过调整水热合成条件，研究人员能够创造出结晶不完全的MFI型硼硅沸石，具有增强的催化性能。

3. 后合成酸处理：研究提到了通过用硝酸处理BMFI-3.0来制备BMFI-3.0-AT，这可能用于修饰硼物种的环境。

这些方法的有效性因催化应用而异。对于丙烷的氧化脱氢（ODHP），结晶不完全的沸石显示出优越的性能，表明控制结晶度的水热合成方法对这种应用特别有效。创造缺陷硼位点和存在氢键SiOH基团对于增强ODHP反应的催化活性似乎至关重要。

然而，该研究主要集中在ODHP上，因此无法根据给定信息全面评估这些方法对其他催化应用的相对有效性。需要进一步研究来评估它们在不同催化过程中的效果。
