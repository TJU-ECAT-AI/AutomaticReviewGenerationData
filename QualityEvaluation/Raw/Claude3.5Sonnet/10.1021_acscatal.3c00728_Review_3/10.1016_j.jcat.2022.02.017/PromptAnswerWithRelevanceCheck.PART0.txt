B-based materials with 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks, such as borosilicate zeolites, exhibit enhanced catalytic performance due to several structural characteristics:

1. Open coordination: Boron species are anchored to the zeolite matrix in an open coordination form, allowing for better accessibility of reactants to the active sites.

2. Hydrogen bonding: The presence of ample SiOH groups on the surface facilitates the formation of hydrogen bonds with BOH in defective boron species. This interaction not only stabilizes the boron species but also creates active centers for catalysis.

3. Defect-rich structure: Incompletely crystallized zeolites with low crystallinity exhibit superior catalytic activity and higher olefin productivity at low temperatures. This is attributed to the enrichment of defect boron sites in these structures.

4. Uniform dispersion: Boron species are uniformly anchored to the hydroxyl-rich MFI-type zeolite matrix, ensuring a homogeneous distribution of active sites throughout the catalyst.

5. Oligomeric form: The boron species exist in an oligomeric form, which contributes to the construction of highly active boron centers.

The methods used to incorporate B active components into these structures include:

1. Hydrothermal synthesis: The crystallinity of the zeolite is regulated by adjusting hydrothermal synthesis conditions, allowing for control over the formation of defect boron sites.

2. Post-synthesis modification: Techniques such as acid treatment (e.g., BMFI-3.0-AT) can be used to modify the boron species' coordination environment and enhance catalytic performance.

These methods are effective for catalytic applications such as oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP), where the resulting catalysts show extraordinary performance at low reaction temperatures and high weight-hour-space-velocity. The hydrothermal synthesis method appears to be particularly effective in creating catalysts with low crystallinity and enriched defect boron sites, which exhibit superior activity in ODHP reactions.

However, the effectiveness of these methods may vary for different catalytic applications. For reactions that require different types of active sites or operating conditions, alternative incorporation methods or modifications to the existing techniques may be necessary to optimize catalyst performance.

For ODHP reactions, the incomplete crystallization method proves to be highly effective, as it results in a catalyst with high olefin productivity at low reaction temperatures and high weight-hour-space-velocity. This method enriches the defect boron sites with hydrogen bonding to adjacent silanols, which are responsible for the superior catalytic activity.

The hydrothermal synthesis method allows for control over the crystallinity and distribution of boron species, which is crucial for tailoring the catalyst's properties for specific applications. However, the optimal degree of crystallinity may vary depending on the target reaction.

In conclusion, the incorporation of B active components into 3-D porous frameworks through methods that promote open coordination, hydrogen bonding, and the formation of defect sites appears to be highly effective for enhancing catalytic performance, particularly in low-temperature oxidative dehydrogenation reactions.
