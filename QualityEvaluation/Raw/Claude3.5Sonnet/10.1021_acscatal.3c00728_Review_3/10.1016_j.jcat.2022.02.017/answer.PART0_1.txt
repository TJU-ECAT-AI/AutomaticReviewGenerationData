B-based materials with 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks, such as borosilicate zeolites, exhibit several structural characteristics that enhance catalytic performance:

1. Open coordination: Boron species are anchored to the zeolite matrix in an open coordination form, allowing for better accessibility of reactants to the active sites.

2. Hydrogen bonding: The presence of ample SiOH groups on the surface facilitates the formation of hydrogen bonds with BOH in defective boron species. This interaction not only stabilizes the boron species but also inhibits excessive leaching of boron during catalysis.

3. Dynamic transformation: During the catalytic process, isolated boron species can dynamically transform into aggregated ones, which is associated with increased catalytic activity.

4. Active centers: The BOH groups in aggregated BOx species that form hydrogen bonds with adjacent SiOH groups are identified as highly efficient active centers for catalyzing reactions at low temperatures.

The methods used to incorporate B active components into these structures include:

1. Hydrothermal synthesis: This method is used to prepare borosilicate zeolites with different crystallinity by adjusting the synthesis conditions.

2. Incomplete crystallization: The study shows that incompletely crystallized MFI-type borosilicate zeolite catalysts display extraordinary performance in ODHP reactions.

3. Post-synthesis modification: Although not explicitly mentioned in the given text, this method is often used to introduce or modify boron species in zeolite frameworks.

The effectiveness of these methods varies depending on the catalytic application. For ODHP reactions, the incomplete crystallization method proves to be highly effective, as it results in a catalyst with high olefin productivity at low reaction temperatures and high weight-hour-space-velocity. This method enriches the defect boron sites with hydrogen bonding to adjacent silanols, which are responsible for the superior catalytic activity.

The hydrothermal synthesis method allows for control over the crystallinity and distribution of boron species, which is crucial for tailoring the catalyst's properties for specific applications. However, the optimal degree of crystallinity may vary depending on the target reaction.

In conclusion, the incorporation of B active components into 3-D porous frameworks through methods that promote open coordination, hydrogen bonding, and the formation of defect sites appears to be highly effective for enhancing catalytic performance, particularly in low-temperature oxidative dehydrogenation reactions.

具有三维分散活性位点的多孔框架B基材料展现出几种增强催化性能的结构特征：

1. 开放配位：硼物种以开放配位形式锚定在沸石基质上，使反应物更容易接触到活性位点。

2. 氢键作用：表面上大量的SiOH基团促进了与缺陷硼物种中BOH的氢键形成。这种相互作用不仅稳定了硼物种，还抑制了催化过程中硼的过度流失。

3. 动态转化：在催化过程中，孤立的硼物种可以动态转化为聚集态，这与催化活性的增加有关。

4. 活性中心：与相邻SiOH基团形成氢键的聚集BOx物种中的BOH基团被确定为在低温下高效催化反应的活性中心。

将B活性组分引入这些结构的方法包括：

1. 水热合成：这种方法通过调整合成条件来制备具有不同结晶度的硼硅沸石。

2. 不完全结晶：研究表明，不完全结晶的MFI型硼硅沸石催化剂在ODHP反应中表现出卓越的性能。

3. 后合成修饰：虽然在给定文本中没有明确提到，但这种方法经常用于在沸石骨架中引入或修饰硼物种。

这些方法的有效性因催化应用而异。对于ODHP反应，不完全结晶方法证明是非常有效的，因为它在低反应温度和高重时空速下产生了高烯烃生产率的催化剂。这种方法富集了与相邻硅醇基形成氢键的缺陷硼位点，这是其优异催化活性的原因。

水热合成方法允许控制结晶度和硼物种的分布，这对于针对特定应用调整催化剂的性能至关重要。然而，最佳结晶度可能因目标反应而异。

总之，通过促进开放配位、氢键形成和缺陷位点形成的方法将B活性组分引入三维多孔框架，似乎对增强催化性能非常有效，特别是在低温氧化脱氢反应中。
