[1] "One-dimensional nanomaterials have attracted considerable attention for applications in catalysis because of their conducive to the transmission of substances and the potential for highly active site exposure."

[2] "The chemical and physical properties of nanofibers prepared by the electrospinning method can be easily adjusted by changing conditions in the electrospinning process."

[3] "Meanwhile, there is good interaction between the nanoparticles and the support in the nanocatalyst prepared by the electrospinning method to further ensure their activity, selectivity, and long-term stability."

[4] "The TEM and STEM-EDX mapping images of the h-BN/SiO2 nanofiber catalyst (Figure2fh) showed that the h-BN was uniformly dispersed on the dense SiO2 support."

[5] "The h-BN/SiO2 nanofiber catalyst exhibited a productivity of 24.9golefinsgBN1h1 under 500C at a space velocity of 48000mlgcat1h1. This value was remarkably higher than that of the bulk h-BN catalyst and most reported boron-based catalysts (Table1) used in the ODHP reaction."

[6] "It revealed that the one-dimensional h-BN/SiO2 nanofiber catalyst with well-dispersed h-BN exhibited better catalytic efficiency under high space velocity conditions, possibly because it enhanced the mass transfer to allow the active sites easily exposed."

The structural characteristics of B-based materials with 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks include:

1. One-dimensional nanostructure: This allows for better transmission of substances and higher exposure of active sites.

2. Uniform dispersion: The active B component (h-BN in this case) is uniformly dispersed on the support material (SiO2).

3. Good interaction between nanoparticles and support: This ensures better activity, selectivity, and long-term stability of the catalyst.

These features enhance catalytic performance by:

1. Improving mass transfer: The one-dimensional structure facilitates the movement of reactants and products.

2. Increasing active site exposure: The uniform dispersion and nanostructure allow for more active sites to be accessible to reactants.

3. Enhancing stability: The strong interaction between the active component and support improves the catalyst's long-term performance.

The method used to incorporate B active components into these structures in this study is electrospinning. This method is effective because:

1. It allows for easy adjustment of chemical and physical properties of the nanofibers by changing the electrospinning conditions.

2. It results in good interaction between the active component (h-BN) and the support (SiO2).

3. It produces a one-dimensional nanostructure that enhances catalytic performance.

The effectiveness of this method is demonstrated by the significantly higher productivity of the h-BN/SiO2 nanofiber catalyst compared to bulk h-BN and other reported boron-based catalysts in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reaction.

For different catalytic applications, the effectiveness of electrospinning may vary depending on the specific requirements of the reaction and the nature of the active component and support material. However, its ability to create well-dispersed, one-dimensional nanostructures with good component interactions makes it a promising method for many catalytic applications, especially those that benefit from enhanced mass transfer and high active site exposure.

具有3-D分散活性位点的B基材料在多孔框架中的结构特征包括：

1. 一维纳米结构：这允许更好的物质传输和更高的活性位点暴露。

2. 均匀分散：活性B组分（在这种情况下为h-BN）均匀分散在支撑材料（SiO2）上。

3. 纳米颗粒与支撑材料之间的良好相互作用：这确保了催化剂更好的活性、选择性和长期稳定性。

这些特征通过以下方式增强催化性能：

1. 改善物质传输：一维结构有助于反应物和产物的移动。

2. 增加活性位点暴露：均匀分散和纳米结构允许更多的活性位点接触反应物。

3. 提高稳定性：活性组分与支撑材料之间的强相互作用改善了催化剂的长期性能。

本研究中用于将B活性组分纳入这些结构的方法是电纺丝。这种方法之所以有效，是因为：

1. 它允许通过改变电纺丝条件来轻松调整纳米纤维的化学和物理性质。

2. 它导致活性组分（h-BN）和支撑材料（SiO2）之间的良好相互作用。

3. 它产生了一种增强催化性能的一维纳米结构。

该方法的有效性通过h-BN/SiO2纳米纤维催化剂在丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）反应中的产率显著高于块状h-BN和其他报道的硼基催化剂得到了证明。

对于不同的催化应用，电纺丝的有效性可能会因反应的具体要求以及活性组分和支撑材料的性质而有所不同。然而，它创造良好分散的一维纳米结构并具有良好组分相互作用的能力使其成为许多催化应用的有前景方法，特别是那些受益于增强的物质传输和高活性位点暴露的应用。
