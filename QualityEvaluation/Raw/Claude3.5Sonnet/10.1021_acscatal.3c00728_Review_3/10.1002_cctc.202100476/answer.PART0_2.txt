[1] "One-dimensional nanomaterials have attracted considerable attention for applications in catalysis because of their conducive to the transmission of substances and the potential for highly active site exposure."

[2] "Meanwhile, there is good interaction between the nanoparticles and the support in the nanocatalyst prepared by the electrospinning method to further ensure their activity, selectivity, and long-term stability."

[3] "The TEM and STEM-EDX mapping images of the h-BN/SiO2 nanofiber catalyst (Figure2fh) showed that the h-BN was uniformly dispersed on the dense SiO2 support."

[4] "The h-BN/SiO2 nanofiber catalyst exhibited a productivity of 24.9golefinsgBN1h1 under 500C at a space velocity of 48000mlgcat1h1. This value was remarkably higher than that of the bulk h-BN catalyst and most reported boron-based catalysts (Table1) used in the ODHP reaction."

[5] "The higher activity for the h-BN/SiO2 nanofiber catalyst was mainly because that the one-dimensional structure facilitated active site exposure, participating in the catalysis and achieving a higher conversion."

The study focuses on h-BN/SiO2 nanofiber catalysts, which represent a type of B-based material with 3-D dispersed active sites in a porous framework. These structural characteristics enhance catalytic performance in several ways:

1. Improved mass transfer: The one-dimensional nanofiber structure facilitates the transmission of substances, allowing reactants to access active sites more easily.

2. Increased active site exposure: The nanofiber structure provides a high surface area, exposing more active sites for catalysis.

3. Enhanced stability: The good interaction between h-BN nanoparticles and the SiO2 support ensures long-term stability of the catalyst.

4. Uniform dispersion: The h-BN is uniformly dispersed on the SiO2 support, leading to a more efficient utilization of the active components.

The method used to incorporate B active components into these structures is electrospinning. This technique appears to be highly effective for creating nanofiber catalysts with well-dispersed active sites. The electrospinning method allows for:

1. Control over fiber diameter and morphology by adjusting process parameters.
2. Uniform dispersion of h-BN within the SiO2 matrix.
3. Creation of a one-dimensional structure that enhances mass transfer and active site exposure.

The effectiveness of this method is demonstrated by the superior catalytic performance of the h-BN/SiO2 nanofiber catalyst in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reaction. The nanofiber catalyst showed remarkably higher olefin productivity compared to bulk h-BN and other reported boron-based catalysts.

While this study focuses on ODHP, the electrospinning method for incorporating B-based active components into nanofiber structures could potentially be applied to other catalytic applications that benefit from high surface area, improved mass transfer, and well-dispersed active sites. However, further research would be needed to evaluate its effectiveness for different types of reactions and catalytic systems.

这项研究主要关注h-BN/SiO2纳米纤维催化剂，这是一种在多孔框架中具有3-D分散活性位点的B基材料。这些结构特征通过以下几种方式增强了催化性能：

1. 改善物质传递：一维纳米纤维结构有利于物质的传输，使反应物更容易接触到活性位点。

2. 增加活性位点暴露：纳米纤维结构提供了高比表面积，暴露出更多的催化活性位点。

3. 提高稳定性：h-BN纳米颗粒与SiO2载体之间的良好相互作用确保了催化剂的长期稳定性。

4. 均匀分散：h-BN在SiO2载体上均匀分散，导致活性组分的利用更加高效。

将B活性组分引入这些结构的方法是电纺丝。这种技术似乎在创建具有良好分散活性位点的纳米纤维催化剂方面非常有效。电纺丝方法允许：

1. 通过调整工艺参数来控制纤维直径和形态。
2. h-BN在SiO2基质中均匀分散。
3. 创建一维结构，增强物质传递和活性位点暴露。

这种方法的有效性通过h-BN/SiO2纳米纤维催化剂在丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）反应中的优异催化性能得到证明。纳米纤维催化剂显示出比块状h-BN和其他报道的硼基催化剂明显更高的烯烃生产率。

虽然这项研究集中在ODHP上，但将B基活性组分通过电纺丝法引入纳米纤维结构的方法可能适用于其他受益于高比表面积、改善物质传递和良好分散活性位点的催化应用。然而，还需要进一步研究来评估其对不同类型反应和催化系统的有效性。
