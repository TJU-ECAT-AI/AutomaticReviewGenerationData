          "One-dimensional nanomaterials have attracted considerable attention for applications in catalysis because of their conducive to the transmission of substances and the potential for highly active site exposure."

"The chemical and physical properties of nanofibers prepared by the electrospinning method can be easily adjusted by changing conditions in the electrospinning process."

"Meanwhile, there is good interaction between the nanoparticles and the support in the nanocatalyst prepared by the electrospinning method to further ensure their activity, selectivity, and long-term stability."

"The TEM and STEM-EDX mapping images of the h-BN/SiO2 nanofiber catalyst (Figure2fh) showed that the h-BN was uniformly dispersed on the dense SiO2 support."

"The higher activity for the h-BN/SiO2 nanofiber catalyst was mainly because that the one-dimensional structure facilitated active site exposure, participating in the catalysis and achieving a higher conversion."

"Fibrous nanomaterials have drawn considerable attention in the field of catalysis due to the promoted utilization of the surface and facilitated mass transfer process."

"The key is to prepare uniform sols consisting of exfoliated h-BN. The diameters of the nanofiber catalysts can be tuned in the range of 150300nm through h-BN loading change."

"The obtained h-BN/SiO2 nanofiber exhibited a macroscopical film and fibrous microstructure (Figure1b). Besides, some knots were observed in the nanofiber structure, indicating that a few large sizes of particles were involved in the prepared nanofiber, consistent with SEM images of exfoliated h-BN."

          The structural characteristics of B-based materials with 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks include:

1. One-dimensional nanofiber structure: This facilitates substance transmission, exposes more active sites, and enhances catalytic performance by improving mass transfer and increasing active site accessibility.

2. Uniform dispersion: h-BN is evenly dispersed on the SiO2 support, creating a 3-D network of active sites throughout the porous framework.

3. Tunable fiber diameters: The ability to control fiber diameter (150-300 nm) through h-BN loading allows for optimization of the catalyst structure.

4. Fibrous microstructure: The nanofiber structure provides a high surface area and allows for better mass transfer, contributing to improved catalytic efficiency.

5. Good interaction between nanoparticles and support: This ensures better activity, selectivity, and long-term stability of the catalyst.

These structural features enhance catalytic performance by:

1. Increasing active site exposure: The one-dimensional structure and uniform dispersion of h-BN maximize the number of accessible active sites.

2. Improving mass transfer: The fibrous structure facilitates the movement of reactants and products within the catalyst.

3. Enhancing stability: The strong interaction between the active component and support improves the catalyst's long-term performance.

The primary method discussed for incorporating B active components into these structures is electrospinning. This technique is effective because:

1. It allows for easy adjustment of the chemical and physical properties of the nanofibers by modifying the electrospinning conditions.

2. It enables uniform dispersion of the active component (h-BN) on the support material (SiO2).

3. It produces a one-dimensional nanostructure that enhances catalytic performance.

4. It allows for control over fiber diameter and morphology by adjusting process parameters.

The effectiveness of this method is demonstrated by the superior catalytic performance of the h-BN/SiO2 nanofiber catalyst in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reaction, showing significantly higher productivity compared to bulk h-BN and other reported boron-based catalysts.

While the study focuses primarily on ODHP, the electrospinning method for incorporating B-based active components into nanofiber structures could potentially be applied to other catalytic applications that benefit from high surface area, improved mass transfer, and well-dispersed active sites. However, further research would be needed to evaluate its effectiveness for different types of reactions and catalytic systems.

          具有3-D分散活性位点的B基材料在多孔框架中的结构特征包括：

1. 一维纳米纤维结构：这促进了物质传输，暴露了更多的活性位点，并通过改善质量传递和增加活性位点可及性来增强催化性能。

2. 均匀分散：h-BN在SiO2支撑体上均匀分散，在多孔框架中形成了3-D活性位点网络。

3. 可调节的纤维直径：通过调节h-BN负载量来控制纤维直径（150-300 nm）的能力允许优化催化剂结构。

4. 纤维状微观结构：纳米纤维结构提供了高比表面积，并允许更好的质量传递，有助于提高催化效率。

5. 纳米颗粒与支撑材料之间的良好相互作用：这确保了催化剂更好的活性、选择性和长期稳定性。

这些结构特征通过以下方式增强催化性能：

1. 增加活性位点暴露：一维结构和h-BN的均匀分散最大化了可访问的活性位点数量。

2. 改善质量传递：纤维状结构有利于反应物和产物在催化剂内的移动。

3. 提高稳定性：活性组分与支撑材料之间的强相互作用改善了催化剂的长期性能。

讨论的将B活性成分纳入这些结构中的主要方法是电纺丝。这种技术之所以有效，是因为：

1. 它允许通过修改电纺丝条件来轻松调整纳米纤维的化学和物理性质。

2. 它能够在支撑材料（SiO2）上均匀分散活性成分（h-BN）。

3. 它产生了一种增强催化性能的一维纳米结构。

4. 它通过调整工艺参数来控制纤维直径和形态。

该方法的有效性通过h-BN/SiO2纳米纤维催化剂在丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）反应中的优异催化性能得到证明，与块状h-BN和其他报道的硼基催化剂相比，显示出显著更高的生产力。

虽然这项研究主要集中在ODHP上，但将B基活性组分通过电纺丝法引入纳米纤维结构的方法可能适用于其他受益于高比表面积、改善物质传递和良好分散活性位点的催化应用。然而，还需要进行进一步研究来评估其对不同类型反应和催化系统的有效性。
