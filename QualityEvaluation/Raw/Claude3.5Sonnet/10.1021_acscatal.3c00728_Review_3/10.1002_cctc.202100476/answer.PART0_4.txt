[1] "One-dimensional nanomaterials have attracted considerable attention for applications in catalysis because of their conducive to the transmission of substances and the potential for highly active site exposure."

[2] "The obtained h-BN/SiO2 nanofiber exhibited a macroscopical film and fibrous microstructure (Figure1b). Besides, some knots were observed in the nanofiber structure, indicating that a few large sizes of particles were involved in the prepared nanofiber, consistent with SEM images of exfoliated h-BN."

[3] "The TEM and STEM-EDX mapping images of the h-BN/SiO2 nanofiber catalyst (Figure2fh) showed that the h-BN was uniformly dispersed on the dense SiO2 support."

[4] "The h-BN/SiO2 nanofiber catalyst exhibited a productivity of 24.9golefinsgBN1h1 under 500C at a space velocity of 48000mlgcat1h1. This value was remarkably higher than that of the bulk h-BN catalyst and most reported boron-based catalysts (Table1) used in the ODHP reaction."

[5] "The nanofiber catalysts with different h-BN loading showed excellent catalytic performance in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane due to the one-dimensional structure and evenly dispersion of h-BN in the support, as evidenced by high propane conversion and high propylene selectivity."

The structural characteristics of B-based materials with 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks include:

1. One-dimensional nanofiber structure: This facilitates substance transmission and exposes more active sites, enhancing catalytic performance.

2. Uniform dispersion: h-BN is evenly dispersed on the SiO2 support, creating a 3-D network of active sites throughout the porous framework.

3. Fibrous microstructure: The nanofiber structure provides a high surface area and allows for better mass transfer, contributing to improved catalytic efficiency.

These structural features enhance catalytic performance by:

1. Increasing active site exposure: The one-dimensional structure and uniform dispersion of h-BN maximize the number of accessible active sites.

2. Improving mass transfer: The fibrous structure facilitates the movement of reactants and products within the catalyst.

3. Enhancing stability: The SiO2 support anchors the h-BN particles, potentially improving long-term stability.

The method used to incorporate B active components into these structures is electrospinning. This technique involves:

1. Preparing a spinning solution containing exfoliated h-BN, TEOS, and PVA.
2. Ejecting the solution through a needle under an electric field to form nanofibers.
3. Calcinating the collected nanofibers to remove organic components and form the final h-BN/SiO2 structure.

The effectiveness of this method is demonstrated by:

1. Achieving uniform dispersion of h-BN in the SiO2 support.
2. Producing nanofibers with tunable diameters based on h-BN loading.
3. Resulting in significantly higher catalytic productivity compared to bulk h-BN and other reported boron-based catalysts.

For oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP), this method proves highly effective, as evidenced by the superior olefin productivity. However, the effectiveness for other catalytic applications would need further investigation, as this study focused specifically on ODHP.

具有3-D分散活性位点的B基材料在多孔框架中的结构特征包括：

1. 一维纳米纤维结构：这促进了物质传输并暴露了更多的活性位点，从而增强了催化性能。

2. 均匀分散：h-BN在SiO2支撑体上均匀分散，在多孔框架中形成了3-D活性位点网络。

3. 纤维状微观结构：纳米纤维结构提供了高比表面积，并允许更好的质量传递，有助于提高催化效率。

这些结构特征通过以下方式增强催化性能：

1. 增加活性位点暴露：一维结构和h-BN的均匀分散最大化了可访问的活性位点数量。

2. 改善质量传递：纤维状结构有利于反应物和产物在催化剂内的移动。

3. 提高稳定性：SiO2支撑体锚定h-BN颗粒，可能改善长期稳定性。

将B活性组分整合到这些结构中的方法是静电纺丝。这种技术包括：

1. 制备含有剥离h-BN、TEOS和PVA的纺丝溶液。
2. 在电场作用下通过针头喷射溶液形成纳米纤维。
3. 煅烧收集到的纳米纤维以去除有机组分并形成最终的h-BN/SiO2结构。

该方法的有效性体现在：

1. 实现了h-BN在SiO2支撑体中的均匀分散。
2. 根据h-BN负载量生产出可调直径的纳米纤维。
3. 与块状h-BN和其他报道的硼基催化剂相比，催化生产力显著提高。

对于丙烷的氧化脱氢（ODHP），这种方法被证明是非常有效的，这从其优越的烯烃生产力可以看出。然而，对于其他催化应用的有效性还需要进一步研究，因为这项研究主要集中在ODHP上。
