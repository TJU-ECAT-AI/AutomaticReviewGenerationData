The structural characteristics of B-based materials with 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks typically involve one-dimensional nanomaterials, such as nanofibers, which enhance catalytic performance through improved substance transmission and increased active site exposure. These structures facilitate mass transfer and allow for better utilization of the catalyst surface.

The primary method discussed for incorporating B active components into these structures is electrospinning. This technique is effective because:

1. It allows for easy adjustment of the chemical and physical properties of the nanofibers by modifying the electrospinning conditions.
2. It promotes good interaction between the nanoparticles (in this case, h-BN) and the support material (SiO2), leading to improved activity, selectivity, and long-term stability.
3. It enables uniform dispersion of the active component (h-BN) on the support material.

The effectiveness of this method for catalytic applications is demonstrated by the superior performance of the h-BN/SiO2 nanofiber catalyst in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reaction. The one-dimensional structure facilitates active site exposure, resulting in higher conversion rates compared to bulk catalysts.

While the study focuses primarily on the electrospinning method, it suggests that this approach can be extended to prepare other efficient boron-based catalysts in the future. The strategy of effectively dispersing h-BN to enhance space utilization and productivity could potentially be applied to various catalytic applications involving boron-based materials.

具有3-D分散活性位点的B基材料在多孔框架中的结构特征通常涉及一维纳米材料，如纳米纤维，这些材料通过改善物质传输和增加活性位点暴露来增强催化性能。这些结构促进了质量传递，并允许更好地利用催化剂表面。

讨论的将B活性成分incorporation到这些结构中的主要方法是电纺丝。这种技术之所以有效，是因为：

1. 它允许通过修改电纺丝条件来轻松调整纳米纤维的化学和物理性质。
2. 它促进了纳米颗粒（在本例中为h-BN）和支撑材料（SiO2）之间的良好相互作用，从而提高了活性、选择性和长期稳定性。
3. 它能够在支撑材料上均匀分散活性成分（h-BN）。

这种方法在催化应用中的有效性通过h-BN/SiO2纳米纤维催化剂在丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）反应中的优越性能得到了证明。一维结构促进了活性位点的暴露，与块状催化剂相比，转化率更高。

虽然该研究主要集中在电纺丝方法上，但它表明这种方法可以扩展到未来制备其他高效的硼基催化剂。有效分散h-BN以提高空间利用率和生产力的策略可能适用于涉及硼基材料的各种催化应用。
