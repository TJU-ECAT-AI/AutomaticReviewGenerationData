[1] "Fibrous nanomaterials have drawn considerable attention in the field of catalysis due to the promoted utilization of the surface and facilitated mass transfer process."

[2] "The key is to prepare uniform sols consisting of exfoliated h-BN. The diameters of the nanofiber catalysts can be tuned in the range of 150300nm through h-BN loading change."

[3] "When used in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP), the obtained nanofibrous catalysts exhibited a 12.4% conversion of propane and 85.1% selectivity towards propylene, with remarkable olefins productivity of 24.9golefinsgBN1h1, which is more than 5 times higher than that of bulk ODHP catalysts reported to date."

[4] "The TEM and STEM-EDX mapping images of the h-BN/SiO2 nanofiber catalyst (Figure2fh) showed that the h-BN was uniformly dispersed on the dense SiO2 support."

[5] "The higher activity for the h-BN/SiO2 nanofiber catalyst was mainly because that the one-dimensional structure facilitated active site exposure, participating in the catalysis and achieving a higher conversion."

The h-BN/SiO2 nanofiber catalyst described in this study demonstrates how 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks can enhance catalytic performance. The one-dimensional fibrous structure of the catalyst promotes surface utilization and facilitates mass transfer, leading to improved catalytic activity. The uniform dispersion of h-BN on the SiO2 support creates a 3-D network of active sites throughout the porous nanofiber structure.

The structural characteristics that enhance catalytic performance include:

1. One-dimensional nanofiber morphology: This facilitates active site exposure and mass transfer.
2. Tunable fiber diameters: The ability to control fiber diameter (150-300 nm) through h-BN loading allows for optimization of the catalyst structure.
3. Uniform dispersion of h-BN: This ensures a high density of active sites throughout the catalyst.

The method used to incorporate B active components into these structures is electrospinning. This technique proves effective for creating one-dimensional nanofibers with well-dispersed h-BN. The key steps in this method include:

1. Preparation of uniform sols with exfoliated h-BN
2. Electrospinning of the sol to form nanofibers
3. Calcination to remove organic components and form the final catalyst structure

The effectiveness of this method is demonstrated by the superior catalytic performance of the h-BN/SiO2 nanofiber catalyst in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP). The catalyst shows high propane conversion (12.4%), excellent selectivity towards propylene (85.1%), and remarkable olefins productivity (24.9 g olefins g BN^-1 h^-1), which is more than 5 times higher than bulk ODHP catalysts.

While this method proves highly effective for ODHP, its applicability to other catalytic applications would depend on the specific reaction requirements and the nature of the active sites needed. The flexibility of the electrospinning method in terms of material selection and structural control suggests it could be adapted for various catalytic applications requiring dispersed active sites in porous frameworks.

本研究中描述的h-BN/SiO2纳米纤维催化剂展示了多孔框架中三维分散活性位点如何增强催化性能。催化剂的一维纤维结构促进了表面利用率并加速了质量传递过程，从而提高了催化活性。h-BN在SiO2支撑体上的均匀分散在多孔纳米纤维结构中形成了三维活性位点网络。

增强催化性能的结构特征包括：

1. 一维纳米纤维形态：这有利于活性位点暴露和质量传递。
2. 可调节的纤维直径：通过调节h-BN负载量来控制纤维直径（150-300 nm）的能力允许优化催化剂结构。
3. h-BN的均匀分散：这确保了整个催化剂中高密度的活性位点。

将B活性组分引入这些结构的方法是电纺丝。这种技术被证明可以有效地创建具有良好分散h-BN的一维纳米纤维。该方法的关键步骤包括：

1. 制备含有剥离h-BN的均匀溶胶
2. 对溶胶进行电纺丝以形成纳米纤维
3. 煅烧以去除有机组分并形成最终的催化剂结构

该方法的有效性通过h-BN/SiO2纳米纤维催化剂在丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）反应中的优异催化性能得到证明。该催化剂表现出高丙烷转化率（12.4%），优异的丙烯选择性（85.1%），以及显著的烯烃生产力（24.9 g烯烃 g BN^-1 h^-1），比体相ODHP催化剂高5倍以上。

虽然这种方法在ODHP中被证明非常有效，但其对其他催化应用的适用性将取决于特定反应要求和所需活性位点的性质。电纺丝方法在材料选择和结构控制方面的灵活性表明，它可以适用于各种需要在多孔框架中分散活性位点的催化应用。
