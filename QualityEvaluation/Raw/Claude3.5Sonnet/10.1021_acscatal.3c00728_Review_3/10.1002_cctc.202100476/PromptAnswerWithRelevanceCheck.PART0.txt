The structural characteristics of B-based materials with 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks typically involve one-dimensional nanomaterials, such as nanofibers, which enhance catalytic performance through improved substance transmission and increased active site exposure. These structures facilitate mass transfer and allow for better utilization of the catalyst surface.

The primary method discussed for incorporating B active components into these structures is electrospinning. This technique is effective because:

1. It allows for easy adjustment of the chemical and physical properties of the nanofibers by modifying the electrospinning conditions.
2. It promotes good interaction between the nanoparticles (in this case, h-BN) and the support material (SiO2), leading to improved activity, selectivity, and long-term stability.
3. It enables uniform dispersion of the active component (h-BN) on the support material.

The effectiveness of this method for catalytic applications is demonstrated by the superior performance of the h-BN/SiO2 nanofiber catalyst in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reaction. The one-dimensional structure facilitates active site exposure, resulting in higher conversion rates compared to bulk catalysts.

While the study focuses primarily on the electrospinning method, it suggests that this approach can be extended to prepare other efficient boron-based catalysts in the future. The strategy of effectively dispersing h-BN to enhance space utilization and productivity could potentially be applied to various catalytic applications involving boron-based materials.

The structural characteristics of B-based materials with 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks include:

1. One-dimensional nanostructure: This allows for better transmission of substances and higher exposure of active sites.

2. Uniform dispersion: The active B component (h-BN in this case) is uniformly dispersed on the support material (SiO2).

3. Good interaction between nanoparticles and support: This ensures better activity, selectivity, and long-term stability of the catalyst.

These features enhance catalytic performance by:

1. Improving mass transfer: The one-dimensional structure facilitates the movement of reactants and products.

2. Increasing active site exposure: The uniform dispersion and nanostructure allow for more active sites to be accessible to reactants.

3. Enhancing stability: The strong interaction between the active component and support improves the catalyst's long-term performance.

The method used to incorporate B active components into these structures in this study is electrospinning. This method is effective because:

1. It allows for easy adjustment of chemical and physical properties of the nanofibers by changing the electrospinning conditions.

2. It results in good interaction between the active component (h-BN) and the support (SiO2).

3. It produces a one-dimensional nanostructure that enhances catalytic performance.

The effectiveness of this method is demonstrated by the significantly higher productivity of the h-BN/SiO2 nanofiber catalyst compared to bulk h-BN and other reported boron-based catalysts in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reaction.

For different catalytic applications, the effectiveness of electrospinning may vary depending on the specific requirements of the reaction and the nature of the active component and support material. However, its ability to create well-dispersed, one-dimensional nanostructures with good component interactions makes it a promising method for many catalytic applications, especially those that benefit from enhanced mass transfer and high active site exposure.

The study focuses on h-BN/SiO2 nanofiber catalysts, which represent a type of B-based material with 3-D dispersed active sites in a porous framework. These structural characteristics enhance catalytic performance in several ways:

1. Improved mass transfer: The one-dimensional nanofiber structure facilitates the transmission of substances, allowing reactants to access active sites more easily.

2. Increased active site exposure: The nanofiber structure provides a high surface area, exposing more active sites for catalysis.

3. Enhanced stability: The good interaction between h-BN nanoparticles and the SiO2 support ensures long-term stability of the catalyst.

4. Uniform dispersion: The h-BN is uniformly dispersed on the SiO2 support, leading to a more efficient utilization of the active components.

The method used to incorporate B active components into these structures is electrospinning. This technique appears to be highly effective for creating nanofiber catalysts with well-dispersed active sites. The electrospinning method allows for:

1. Control over fiber diameter and morphology by adjusting process parameters.
2. Uniform dispersion of h-BN within the SiO2 matrix.
3. Creation of a one-dimensional structure that enhances mass transfer and active site exposure.

The effectiveness of this method is demonstrated by the superior catalytic performance of the h-BN/SiO2 nanofiber catalyst in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reaction. The nanofiber catalyst showed remarkably higher olefin productivity compared to bulk h-BN and other reported boron-based catalysts.

While this study focuses on ODHP, the electrospinning method for incorporating B-based active components into nanofiber structures could potentially be applied to other catalytic applications that benefit from high surface area, improved mass transfer, and well-dispersed active sites. However, further research would be needed to evaluate its effectiveness for different types of reactions and catalytic systems.

The h-BN/SiO2 nanofiber catalyst described in this study demonstrates how 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks can enhance catalytic performance. The one-dimensional fibrous structure of the catalyst promotes surface utilization and facilitates mass transfer, leading to improved catalytic activity. The uniform dispersion of h-BN on the SiO2 support creates a 3-D network of active sites throughout the porous nanofiber structure.

The structural characteristics that enhance catalytic performance include:

1. One-dimensional nanofiber morphology: This facilitates active site exposure and mass transfer.
2. Tunable fiber diameters: The ability to control fiber diameter (150-300 nm) through h-BN loading allows for optimization of the catalyst structure.
3. Uniform dispersion of h-BN: This ensures a high density of active sites throughout the catalyst.

The method used to incorporate B active components into these structures is electrospinning. This technique proves effective for creating one-dimensional nanofibers with well-dispersed h-BN. The key steps in this method include:

1. Preparation of uniform sols with exfoliated h-BN
2. Electrospinning of the sol to form nanofibers
3. Calcination to remove organic components and form the final catalyst structure

The effectiveness of this method is demonstrated by the superior catalytic performance of the h-BN/SiO2 nanofiber catalyst in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP). The catalyst shows high propane conversion (12.4%), excellent selectivity towards propylene (85.1%), and remarkable olefins productivity (24.9 g olefins g BN^-1 h^-1), which is more than 5 times higher than bulk ODHP catalysts.

While this method proves highly effective for ODHP, its applicability to other catalytic applications would depend on the specific reaction requirements and the nature of the active sites needed. The flexibility of the electrospinning method in terms of material selection and structural control suggests it could be adapted for various catalytic applications requiring dispersed active sites in porous frameworks.
