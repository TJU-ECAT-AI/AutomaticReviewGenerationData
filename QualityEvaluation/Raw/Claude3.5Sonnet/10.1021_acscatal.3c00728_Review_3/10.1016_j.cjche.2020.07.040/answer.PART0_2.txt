[1] "Boron-based metal-free catalysts for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) have drawn great attention in both academia and industry due to their impressive activity and olefin selectivity."

[2] "The well-developed straight channels of honeycomb cordierite make it possible to carry out the reactor under high gas hourly space velocity (GHSV) and the thin wash-coated B2O3 layer can effectively facilitate the pore diffusion on the catalyst."

[3] "SiO2 obtained by TEOS hydrolysis acts as a media layer to bridge the cordierite substrate and boron oxide via abundant SiOH groups."

[4] "The presence of B2O3 largely promoted the catalytic activity as compared to the SiO2@HC support."

[5] "To solve this problem, the cordierite support was modified by an additional silica coating layer which can attach firmly on the cordierite substrate possibly by forming SiOAl, SiOMg, SiOSi bonds, and attach to the boron oxide layer via SiOB bonds."

The structural characteristics of B-based materials with 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks enhance catalytic performance in several ways:

1. Improved dispersion: The honeycomb cordierite structure provides a high surface area for dispersing the active B2O3 component, leading to better accessibility of active sites.

2. Enhanced mass transfer: The straight channels of the honeycomb structure facilitate high gas hourly space velocity (GHSV) and improve pore diffusion, resulting in better reactant-catalyst contact.

3. Stability: The SiO2 coating acts as a bridging layer between the cordierite substrate and B2O3, improving the attachment and stability of the active component.

The methods used to incorporate B active components into these structures include:

1. Two-step wash-coating: First, SiO2 is coated on the cordierite support, followed by B2O3 coating. This method is effective in creating a stable, well-dispersed catalyst.

2. Direct coating: B2O3 can be directly coated on the cordierite, but this method may result in lower stability and active component loss.

3. Chemical vapor deposition (CVD): Used for preparing h-BN/Cordierite catalysts, this method can create uniform coatings but may require higher temperatures.

The effectiveness of these methods depends on the specific catalytic application:

- For ODHP, the two-step wash-coating method proves most effective, as it provides high stability, good dispersion, and excellent catalytic performance.

- For other applications requiring higher temperature stability, CVD methods may be more suitable.

The choice of method should consider factors such as desired catalyst structure, thermal stability requirements, and the specific chemistry of the target reaction.

基于B的材料在多孔框架中具有3-D分散活性位点的结构特征通过以下几种方式增强了催化性能：

1. 改善分散性：蜂窝状堇青石结构提供了高表面积，用于分散活性B2O3组分，从而提高了活性位点的可及性。

2. 增强物质传递：蜂窝结构的直通道有利于高气体空速（GHSV）并改善孔扩散，从而实现更好的反应物-催化剂接触。

3. 稳定性：SiO2涂层作为堇青石基底和B2O3之间的桥接层，提高了活性组分的附着力和稳定性。

将B活性组分引入这些结构的方法包括：

1. 两步涂覆法：首先在堇青石支撑体上涂覆SiO2，然后涂覆B2O3。这种方法可以有效地制造稳定、分散良好的催化剂。

2. 直接涂覆：B2O3可以直接涂覆在堇青石上，但这种方法可能导致稳定性较低和活性组分流失。

3. 化学气相沉积（CVD）：用于制备h-BN/堇青石催化剂，这种方法可以创造均匀的涂层，但可能需要更高的温度。

这些方法的有效性取决于具体的催化应用：

- 对于ODHP，两步涂覆法被证明最有效，因为它提供了高稳定性、良好的分散性和优异的催化性能。

- 对于需要更高温度稳定性的其他应用，CVD方法可能更合适。

选择方法时应考虑诸如所需的催化剂结构、热稳定性要求以及目标反应的具体化学性质等因素。
