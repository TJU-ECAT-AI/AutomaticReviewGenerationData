The structural characteristics of B-based materials with 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks include:

1. Use of boron oxide (B2O3) as the active component, which provides impressive activity and olefin selectivity for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP).

2. Incorporation of B2O3 onto a porous support structure, typically silica-based, which helps disperse and stabilize the active boron species.

3. Utilization of a honeycomb cordierite monolith structure with straight channels, allowing for high gas hourly space velocity (GHSV) and improved mass transfer.

These structural features enhance catalytic performance by:

1. Providing a large surface area for dispersing active boron sites.
2. Improving mass transfer and reducing diffusion limitations through the porous structure and straight channels.
3. Allowing operation at high GHSV, which can improve selectivity by reducing over-oxidation.

The main method used to incorporate B active components in this study was a two-step wash-coating process:

1. First, coating the cordierite support with silica (SiO2) obtained from TEOS hydrolysis.
2. Then, coating with boron oxide (B2O3) using a boric acid solution.

This method proved effective by:

1. Using SiO2 as a bridging layer between the cordierite substrate and B2O3, improving adhesion and stability.
2. Forming SiO-B bonds, which help anchor the active boron species.
3. Allowing for precise control of B2O3 loading and uniform distribution.

The effectiveness of this method is demonstrated by the high catalytic performance achieved, with excellent propylene selectivity and high GHSV. However, it's important to note that the optimal preparation conditions (e.g., B2O3 loading, calcination temperature) need to be carefully controlled to achieve the best performance.

While this method was specifically developed for ODHP catalysts, similar approaches could potentially be adapted for other catalytic applications requiring dispersed active sites in porous frameworks. However, the effectiveness would depend on the specific requirements of each application, such as the nature of the active species, reaction conditions, and desired catalytic properties.

具有三维分散活性位点的B基材料在多孔框架中的结构特征包括：

1. 使用三氧化硼（B2O3）作为活性组分，为丙烷的氧化脱氢（ODHP）提供了出色的活性和烯烃选择性。

2. 将B2O3引入到多孔支撑结构中，通常是硅基的，这有助于分散和稳定活性硼物种。

3. 利用蜂窝状堇青石整体结构，具有直通道，允许高气体时空速度（GHSV）和改善的传质。

这些结构特征通过以下方式增强催化性能：

1. 为分散活性硼位点提供大表面积。
2. 通过多孔结构和直通道改善传质并减少扩散限制。
3. 允许在高GHSV下操作，这可以通过减少过度氧化来提高选择性。

本研究中用于引入B活性组分的主要方法是两步涂覆过程：

1. 首先，用通过TEOS水解获得的二氧化硅（SiO2）涂覆堇青石支撑体。
2. 然后，使用硼酸溶液涂覆三氧化硼（B2O3）。

这种方法证明是有效的，因为：

1. 使用SiO2作为堇青石基底和B2O3之间的桥接层，改善粘附性和稳定性。
2. 形成Si-O-B键，有助于锚定活性硼物种。
3. 允许精确控制B2O3负载量和均匀分布。

该方法的有效性通过达到的高催化性能得到证明，具有优异的丙烯选择性和高GHSV。然而，需要注意的是，最佳制备条件（如B2O3负载量、煅烧温度）需要仔细控制以达到最佳性能。

虽然这种方法是专门为ODHP催化剂开发的，但类似的方法可能会被调整用于其他需要在多孔框架中分散活性位点的催化应用。然而，其有效性将取决于每个应用的具体要求，如活性物种的性质、反应条件和所需的催化性能。

The structural characteristics of B-based materials with 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks, as described in the literature, primarily focus on a honeycomb cordierite monolithic catalyst coated with SiO2 and B2O3. This structure enhances catalytic performance in several ways:

1. The honeycomb cordierite provides well-developed straight channels, allowing for high gas hourly space velocity (GHSV) and improved mass transfer.

2. The thin wash-coated B2O3 layer facilitates pore diffusion on the catalyst surface.

3. The SiO2 layer acts as a media between the cordierite substrate and boron oxide, providing abundant SiOH groups for better attachment of the active B2O3 layer.

The method used to incorporate B active components into these structures involves a two-step coating process:

1. First, SiO2 is coated onto the cordierite support using TEOS hydrolysis.
2. Then, B2O3 is coated onto the SiO2 layer.

This method proves effective for ODHP catalysis, as evidenced by the high propylene selectivity, olefin selectivity, and low CO2 production under high GHSV conditions. The SiO2 layer plays a crucial role in stabilizing the active boron species by forming SiOB bonds, which improves the catalyst's thermal stability and performance.

While this method is highly effective for ODHP, its relative effectiveness for other catalytic applications is not discussed in the given literature. However, the principles of using a porous support structure and a mediating layer to disperse and stabilize active sites could potentially be applied to other catalytic systems, although further research would be needed to confirm this.

文献中描述的具有3D分散活性位点的B基材料在多孔框架中的结构特征主要集中在涂覆有SiO2和B2O3的蜂窝状堇青石整体催化剂上。这种结构通过以下几种方式提高了催化性能：

1. 蜂窝状堇青石提供了发达的直通道，允许高气体小时空速（GHSV）和改善的传质。

2. 薄的涂覆B2O3层有利于催化剂表面的孔扩散。

3. SiO2层作为堇青石基底和氧化硼之间的媒介，提供了丰富的SiOH基团，使活性B2O3层更好地附着。

将B活性组分结合到这些结构中的方法涉及两步涂覆过程：

1. 首先，使用TEOS水解将SiO2涂覆在堇青石支撑体上。
2. 然后，将B2O3涂覆在SiO2层上。

这种方法在ODHP催化中证明是有效的，这从高丙烯选择性、烯烃选择性以及高GHSV条件下低CO2产生量可以看出。SiO2层通过形成SiOB键在稳定活性硼物种方面起着关键作用，这提高了催化剂的热稳定性和性能。

虽然这种方法对ODHP非常有效，但给定的文献中并未讨论它对其他催化应用的相对有效性。然而，使用多孔支撑结构和中间层来分散和稳定活性位点的原理可能适用于其他催化系统，尽管需要进一步的研究来证实这一点。

The structural characteristics of B-based materials with 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks enhance catalytic performance in several ways:

1. Improved dispersion: The honeycomb cordierite structure provides a high surface area for dispersing the active B2O3 component, leading to better accessibility of active sites.

2. Enhanced mass transfer: The straight channels of the honeycomb structure facilitate high gas hourly space velocity (GHSV) and improve pore diffusion, resulting in better reactant-catalyst contact.

3. Stability: The SiO2 coating acts as a bridging layer between the cordierite substrate and B2O3, improving the attachment and stability of the active component.

The methods used to incorporate B active components into these structures include:

1. Two-step wash-coating: First, SiO2 is coated on the cordierite support, followed by B2O3 coating. This method is effective in creating a stable, well-dispersed catalyst.

2. Direct coating: B2O3 can be directly coated on the cordierite, but this method may result in lower stability and active component loss.

3. Chemical vapor deposition (CVD): Used for preparing h-BN/Cordierite catalysts, this method can create uniform coatings but may require higher temperatures.

The effectiveness of these methods depends on the specific catalytic application:

- For ODHP, the two-step wash-coating method proves most effective, as it provides high stability, good dispersion, and excellent catalytic performance.

- For other applications requiring higher temperature stability, CVD methods may be more suitable.

The choice of method should consider factors such as desired catalyst structure, thermal stability requirements, and the specific chemistry of the target reaction.

The structural characteristics of B-based materials with 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks described in this literature primarily focus on a honeycomb cordierite monolithic catalyst with B2O3 as the active component. This structure enhances catalytic performance in several ways:

1. The honeycomb cordierite provides well-developed straight channels, allowing for high gas hourly space velocity (GHSV) and improved mass transfer.

2. The thin wash-coated B2O3 layer on the cordierite walls facilitates pore diffusion, leading to more efficient use of the catalyst.

3. The 3-D structure of the honeycomb allows for better dispersion of the active B2O3 component throughout the catalyst.

The method used to incorporate B active components into these structures involves a two-step coating process:

1. First, a SiO2 layer is coated onto the cordierite substrate using TEOS hydrolysis. This silica layer acts as a media layer, providing abundant SiOH groups to anchor the boron oxide.

2. Second, the B2O3 is coated onto the SiO2-modified cordierite through a dipping process using boric acid solution, followed by calcination.

This method is effective for ODHP catalysis, as evidenced by the high propylene selectivity and low CO2 production achieved. The silica coating layer improves catalyst stability without negatively affecting selectivity, which is an advantage over some other SiO2-supported boron catalysts.

The effectiveness of this method for other catalytic applications is not directly addressed in the literature. However, the principles of using a media layer to improve active component adhesion and stability, combined with a monolithic structure for improved mass transfer, could potentially be applied to other catalytic systems. The specific effectiveness would depend on the particular reaction and active components involved.

本文献中描述的具有三维分散活性位点的B基材料的结构特征主要集中在以B2O3为活性组分的蜂窝状堇青石整体催化剂上。这种结构通过以下几种方式增强了催化性能：

1. 蜂窝状堇青石提供了发达的直通道，允许高气体小时空速（GHSV）和改善的传质。

2. 在堇青石壁上涂覆的薄B2O3层有助于孔扩散，从而更有效地利用催化剂。

3. 蜂窝的三维结构允许活性B2O3组分在整个催化剂中更好地分散。

将B活性组分引入这些结构的方法涉及两步涂覆过程：

1. 首先，使用TEOS水解在堇青石基底上涂覆一层SiO2。这个硅层作为媒介层，提供丰富的SiOH基团来锚定氧化硼。

2. 其次，通过使用硼酸溶液的浸渍过程，将B2O3涂覆在经SiO2修饰的堇青石上，然后进行煅烧。

这种方法对ODHP催化反应效果显著，从achieved的高丙烯选择性和低CO2产量可以证明。硅涂层改善了催化剂稳定性，同时不会对选择性产生负面影响，这是相对于其他一些SiO2负载的硼催化剂的优势。

文献中没有直接讨论这种方法对其他催化应用的有效性。然而，使用媒介层来改善活性组分的粘附性和稳定性，结合整体结构以改善传质的原理，可能适用于其他催化系统。具体的有效性将取决于特定的反应和涉及的活性组分。

The literature discusses B-based materials in monolithic honeycomb structures rather than 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks. However, some insights can be drawn about the structural characteristics and incorporation methods of B-based catalysts:

1. The B2O3/SiO2@HC catalyst uses a two-step coating method to incorporate boron oxide onto a cordierite honeycomb support. This creates a thin, well-dispersed B2O3 layer on the channel walls.

2. The honeycomb structure with straight channels enables high gas hourly space velocity and facilitates pore diffusion, enhancing catalytic performance.

3. SiO2 is used as a mediating layer between the cordierite substrate and B2O3, providing abundant SiOH groups to anchor the boron species. This improves the stability and dispersion of the active component.

4. The coating method allows for low B2O3 loading while maintaining good catalytic performance, indicating efficient utilization of active sites.

5. Proper calcination temperature is critical to prevent B2O3 vitrification or densification, which could reduce accessible active sites.

This coating approach on a structured support appears effective for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane, providing high selectivity and stability. However, the effectiveness for other catalytic applications is not discussed in the given literature.

这篇文献讨论的是单片蜂窝结构中的B基材料,而不是多孔框架中的3-D分散活性位点。然而,我们可以从中获得一些关于B基催化剂的结构特征和掺入方法的见解:

1. B2O3/SiO2@HC催化剂采用两步涂覆法将三氧化硼掺入堇青石蜂窝支撑体上。这在通道壁上形成了一层薄而分散均匀的B2O3层。

2. 具有直通道的蜂窝结构能够实现高空速,并促进孔扩散,从而提高催化性能。

3. SiO2被用作堇青石基底和B2O3之间的中间层,提供大量的SiOH基团来锚定硼物种。这提高了活性组分的稳定性和分散性。

4. 涂覆方法允许在低B2O3负载量的情况下保持良好的催化性能,表明活性位点得到了有效利用。

5. 适当的煅烧温度对防止B2O3玻璃化或致密化至关重要,因为这可能会减少可接触的活性位点。

这种在结构化支撑体上的涂覆方法似乎对丙烷的氧化脱氢反应很有效,提供了高选择性和稳定性。然而,该文献没有讨论这种方法对其他催化应用的有效性。
