[1] "Boron-based metal-free catalysts for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) have drawn great attention in both academia and industry due to their impressive activity and olefin selectivity."

[2] "SiO2 obtained by TEOS hydrolysis acts as a media layer to bridge the cordierite substrate and boron oxide via abundant SiOH groups."

[3] "The well-developed straight channels of honeycomb cordierite make it possible to carry out the reactor under high gas hourly space velocity (GHSV) and the thin wash-coated B2O3 layer can effectively facilitate the pore diffusion on the catalyst."

[4] "The prepared B2O3/SiO2@HC monolithic catalyst exhibits good catalytic performance at low boron oxide loading and achieves excellent propylene selectivity (86.0%), olefin selectivity (97.6%, propylene and ethylene) and negligible CO2 (0.1%) at 16.9% propane conversion under high GHSV of 345,600ml·(g B2O3)1·h1"

[5] "To solve this problem, the cordierite support was modified by an additional silica coating layer which can attach firmly on the cordierite substrate possibly by forming SiOAl, SiOMg, SiOSi bonds, and attach to the boron oxide layer via SiOB bonds."

The structural characteristics of B-based materials with 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks include:

1. Use of boron oxide (B2O3) as the active component, which provides impressive activity and olefin selectivity for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP).

2. Incorporation of B2O3 onto a porous support structure, typically silica-based, which helps disperse and stabilize the active boron species.

3. Utilization of a honeycomb cordierite monolith structure with straight channels, allowing for high gas hourly space velocity (GHSV) and improved mass transfer.

These structural features enhance catalytic performance by:

1. Providing a large surface area for dispersing active boron sites.
2. Improving mass transfer and reducing diffusion limitations through the porous structure and straight channels.
3. Allowing operation at high GHSV, which can improve selectivity by reducing over-oxidation.

The main method used to incorporate B active components in this study was a two-step wash-coating process:

1. First, coating the cordierite support with silica (SiO2) obtained from TEOS hydrolysis.
2. Then, coating with boron oxide (B2O3) using a boric acid solution.

This method proved effective by:

1. Using SiO2 as a bridging layer between the cordierite substrate and B2O3, improving adhesion and stability.
2. Forming SiO-B bonds, which help anchor the active boron species.
3. Allowing for precise control of B2O3 loading and uniform distribution.

The effectiveness of this method is demonstrated by the high catalytic performance achieved, with excellent propylene selectivity and high GHSV. However, it's important to note that the optimal preparation conditions (e.g., B2O3 loading, calcination temperature) need to be carefully controlled to achieve the best performance.

While this method was specifically developed for ODHP catalysts, similar approaches could potentially be adapted for other catalytic applications requiring dispersed active sites in porous frameworks. However, the effectiveness would depend on the specific requirements of each application, such as the nature of the active species, reaction conditions, and desired catalytic properties.

具有三维分散活性位点的B基材料在多孔框架中的结构特征包括：

1. 使用三氧化硼（B2O3）作为活性组分，为丙烷的氧化脱氢（ODHP）提供了出色的活性和烯烃选择性。

2. 将B2O3引入到多孔支撑结构中，通常是硅基的，这有助于分散和稳定活性硼物种。

3. 利用蜂窝状堇青石整体结构，具有直通道，允许高气体时空速度（GHSV）和改善的传质。

这些结构特征通过以下方式增强催化性能：

1. 为分散活性硼位点提供大表面积。
2. 通过多孔结构和直通道改善传质并减少扩散限制。
3. 允许在高GHSV下操作，这可以通过减少过度氧化来提高选择性。

本研究中用于引入B活性组分的主要方法是两步涂覆过程：

1. 首先，用通过TEOS水解获得的二氧化硅（SiO2）涂覆堇青石支撑体。
2. 然后，使用硼酸溶液涂覆三氧化硼（B2O3）。

这种方法证明是有效的，因为：

1. 使用SiO2作为堇青石基底和B2O3之间的桥接层，改善粘附性和稳定性。
2. 形成Si-O-B键，有助于锚定活性硼物种。
3. 允许精确控制B2O3负载量和均匀分布。

该方法的有效性通过达到的高催化性能得到证明，具有优异的丙烯选择性和高GHSV。然而，需要注意的是，最佳制备条件（如B2O3负载量、煅烧温度）需要仔细控制以达到最佳性能。

虽然这种方法是专门为ODHP催化剂开发的，但类似的方法可能会被调整用于其他需要在多孔框架中分散活性位点的催化应用。然而，其有效性将取决于每个应用的具体要求，如活性物种的性质、反应条件和所需的催化性能。
