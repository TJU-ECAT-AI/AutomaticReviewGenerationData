          [1] "Boron-based metal-free catalysts for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) have drawn great attention in both academia and industry due to their impressive activity and olefin selectivity."

[2] "SiO2 obtained by TEOS hydrolysis acts as a media layer to bridge the cordierite substrate and boron oxide via abundant SiOH groups."

[3] "The well-developed straight channels of honeycomb cordierite make it possible to carry out the reactor under high gas hourly space velocity (GHSV) and the thin wash-coated B2O3 layer can effectively facilitate the pore diffusion on the catalyst."

[4] "The prepared B2O3/SiO2@HC monolithic catalyst exhibits good catalytic performance at low boron oxide loading and achieves excellent propylene selectivity (86.0%), olefin selectivity (97.6%, propylene and ethylene) and negligible CO2 (0.1%) at 16.9% propane conversion under high GHSV of 345,600ml·(g B2O3)1·h1"

[5] "To solve this problem, the cordierite support was modified by an additional silica coating layer which can attach firmly on the cordierite substrate possibly by forming SiOAl, SiOMg, SiOSi bonds, and attach to the boron oxide layer via SiOB bonds."

          The structural characteristics of B-based materials with 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks, as described in the literature, primarily focus on a honeycomb cordierite monolithic catalyst coated with SiO2 and B2O3. These structural features enhance catalytic performance in several ways:

1. Improved dispersion: The honeycomb cordierite structure provides a high surface area for dispersing the active B2O3 component, leading to better accessibility of active sites.

2. Enhanced mass transfer: The well-developed straight channels of the honeycomb structure facilitate high gas hourly space velocity (GHSV) and improve pore diffusion, resulting in better reactant-catalyst contact.

3. Stability: The SiO2 coating acts as a bridging layer between the cordierite substrate and B2O3, improving the attachment and stability of the active component. It forms SiO-Al, SiO-Mg, SiO-Si bonds with the substrate and SiO-B bonds with the boron oxide layer.

4. Thin active layer: The thin wash-coated B2O3 layer effectively facilitates pore diffusion on the catalyst surface.

The method used to incorporate B active components into these structures involves a two-step coating process:

1. First, SiO2 is coated onto the cordierite support using TEOS hydrolysis. This creates a media layer with abundant SiOH groups.
2. Then, B2O3 is coated onto the SiO2 layer using a boric acid solution.

This method proves effective for ODHP catalysis, as evidenced by the high propylene selectivity (86.0%), olefin selectivity (97.6%), and low CO2 production (0.1%) under high GHSV conditions (345,600 ml·(g B2O3)^-1·h^-1). The catalyst shows good performance even at low boron oxide loading.

While this method is highly effective for ODHP, its relative effectiveness for other catalytic applications is not explicitly discussed in the given literature. However, the principles of using a porous support structure and a mediating layer to disperse and stabilize active sites could potentially be applied to other catalytic systems, although further research would be needed to confirm this.

          文献中描述的具有3D分散活性位点的B基材料在多孔框架中的结构特征主要集中在涂覆有SiO2和B2O3的蜂窝状堇青石整体催化剂上。这些结构特征通过以下几种方式提高了催化性能：

1. 改善分散性：蜂窝状堇青石结构提供了高表面积，用于分散活性B2O3组分，从而提高了活性位点的可及性。

2. 增强物质传递：蜂窝结构的发达直通道有利于高气体空速（GHSV）并改善孔扩散，从而实现更好的反应物-催化剂接触。

3. 稳定性：SiO2涂层作为堇青石基底和B2O3之间的桥接层，提高了活性组分的附着力和稳定性。它与基底形成SiO-Al、SiO-Mg、SiO-Si键，与氧化硼层形成SiO-B键。

4. 薄活性层：薄的涂覆B2O3层有效地促进了催化剂表面的孔扩散。

将B活性组分引入这些结构的方法涉及两步涂覆过程：

1. 首先，使用TEOS水解将SiO2涂覆在堇青石支撑体上。这创造了一个具有丰富SiOH基团的媒介层。
2. 然后，使用硼酸溶液将B2O3涂覆在SiO2层上。

这种方法在ODHP催化中被证明是有效的，这从高丙烯选择性（86.0%）、烯烃选择性（97.6%）以及高GHSV条件下（345,600 ml·(g B2O3)^-1·h^-1）低CO2产生量（0.1%）可以看出。该催化剂即使在低硼氧化物负载下也表现出良好的性能。

虽然这种方法对ODHP非常有效，但给定的文献中并未明确讨论它对其他催化应用的相对有效性。然而，使用多孔支撑结构和中间层来分散和稳定活性位点的原理可能适用于其他催化系统，尽管需要进一步的研究来证实这一点。
