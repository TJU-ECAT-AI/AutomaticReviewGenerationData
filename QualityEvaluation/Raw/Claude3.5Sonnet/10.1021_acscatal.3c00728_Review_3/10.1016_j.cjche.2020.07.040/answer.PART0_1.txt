[1] "Boron-based metal-free catalysts for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) have drawn great attention in both academia and industry due to their impressive activity and olefin selectivity."

[2] "SiO2 obtained by TEOS hydrolysis acts as a media layer to bridge the cordierite substrate and boron oxide via abundant SiOH groups."

[3] "The well-developed straight channels of honeycomb cordierite make it possible to carry out the reactor under high gas hourly space velocity (GHSV) and the thin wash-coated B2O3 layer can effectively facilitate the pore diffusion on the catalyst."

[4] "The prepared B2O3/SiO2@HC monolithic catalyst exhibits good catalytic performance at low boron oxide loading and achieves excellent propylene selectivity (86.0%), olefin selectivity (97.6%, propylene and ethylene) and negligible CO2 (0.1%) at 16.9% propane conversion under high GHSV of 345,600ml·(g B2O3)1·h1"

[5] "To solve this problem, the cordierite support was modified by an additional silica coating layer which can attach firmly on the cordierite substrate possibly by forming SiOAl, SiOMg, SiOSi bonds, and attach to the boron oxide layer via SiOB bonds."

The structural characteristics of B-based materials with 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks, as described in the literature, primarily focus on a honeycomb cordierite monolithic catalyst coated with SiO2 and B2O3. This structure enhances catalytic performance in several ways:

1. The honeycomb cordierite provides well-developed straight channels, allowing for high gas hourly space velocity (GHSV) and improved mass transfer.

2. The thin wash-coated B2O3 layer facilitates pore diffusion on the catalyst surface.

3. The SiO2 layer acts as a media between the cordierite substrate and boron oxide, providing abundant SiOH groups for better attachment of the active B2O3 layer.

The method used to incorporate B active components into these structures involves a two-step coating process:

1. First, SiO2 is coated onto the cordierite support using TEOS hydrolysis.
2. Then, B2O3 is coated onto the SiO2 layer.

This method proves effective for ODHP catalysis, as evidenced by the high propylene selectivity, olefin selectivity, and low CO2 production under high GHSV conditions. The SiO2 layer plays a crucial role in stabilizing the active boron species by forming SiOB bonds, which improves the catalyst's thermal stability and performance.

While this method is highly effective for ODHP, its relative effectiveness for other catalytic applications is not discussed in the given literature. However, the principles of using a porous support structure and a mediating layer to disperse and stabilize active sites could potentially be applied to other catalytic systems, although further research would be needed to confirm this.

文献中描述的具有3D分散活性位点的B基材料在多孔框架中的结构特征主要集中在涂覆有SiO2和B2O3的蜂窝状堇青石整体催化剂上。这种结构通过以下几种方式提高了催化性能：

1. 蜂窝状堇青石提供了发达的直通道，允许高气体小时空速（GHSV）和改善的传质。

2. 薄的涂覆B2O3层有利于催化剂表面的孔扩散。

3. SiO2层作为堇青石基底和氧化硼之间的媒介，提供了丰富的SiOH基团，使活性B2O3层更好地附着。

将B活性组分结合到这些结构中的方法涉及两步涂覆过程：

1. 首先，使用TEOS水解将SiO2涂覆在堇青石支撑体上。
2. 然后，将B2O3涂覆在SiO2层上。

这种方法在ODHP催化中证明是有效的，这从高丙烯选择性、烯烃选择性以及高GHSV条件下低CO2产生量可以看出。SiO2层通过形成SiOB键在稳定活性硼物种方面起着关键作用，这提高了催化剂的热稳定性和性能。

虽然这种方法对ODHP非常有效，但给定的文献中并未讨论它对其他催化应用的相对有效性。然而，使用多孔支撑结构和中间层来分散和稳定活性位点的原理可能适用于其他催化系统，尽管需要进一步的研究来证实这一点。
