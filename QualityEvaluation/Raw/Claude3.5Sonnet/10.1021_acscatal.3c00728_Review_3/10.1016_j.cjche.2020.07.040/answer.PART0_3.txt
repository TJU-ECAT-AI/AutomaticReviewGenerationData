[3] "The well-developed straight channels of honeycomb cordierite make it possible to carry out the reactor under high gas hourly space velocity (GHSV) and the thin wash-coated B2O3 layer can effectively facilitate the pore diffusion on the catalyst."

[4] "The prepared B2O3/SiO2@HC monolithic catalyst exhibits good catalytic performance at low boron oxide loading and achieves excellent propylene selectivity (86.0%), olefin selectivity (97.6%, propylene and ethylene) and negligible CO2 (0.1%) at 16.9% propane conversion under high GHSV of 345,600ml·(g B2O3)1·h1"

[5] "The cordierite support was modified by an additional silica coating layer which can attach firmly on the cordierite substrate possibly by forming SiOAl, SiOMg, SiOSi bonds, and attach to the boron oxide layer via SiOB bonds."

The structural characteristics of B-based materials with 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks described in this literature primarily focus on a honeycomb cordierite monolithic catalyst with B2O3 as the active component. This structure enhances catalytic performance in several ways:

1. The honeycomb cordierite provides well-developed straight channels, allowing for high gas hourly space velocity (GHSV) and improved mass transfer.

2. The thin wash-coated B2O3 layer on the cordierite walls facilitates pore diffusion, leading to more efficient use of the catalyst.

3. The 3-D structure of the honeycomb allows for better dispersion of the active B2O3 component throughout the catalyst.

The method used to incorporate B active components into these structures involves a two-step coating process:

1. First, a SiO2 layer is coated onto the cordierite substrate using TEOS hydrolysis. This silica layer acts as a media layer, providing abundant SiOH groups to anchor the boron oxide.

2. Second, the B2O3 is coated onto the SiO2-modified cordierite through a dipping process using boric acid solution, followed by calcination.

This method is effective for ODHP catalysis, as evidenced by the high propylene selectivity and low CO2 production achieved. The silica coating layer improves catalyst stability without negatively affecting selectivity, which is an advantage over some other SiO2-supported boron catalysts.

The effectiveness of this method for other catalytic applications is not directly addressed in the literature. However, the principles of using a media layer to improve active component adhesion and stability, combined with a monolithic structure for improved mass transfer, could potentially be applied to other catalytic systems. The specific effectiveness would depend on the particular reaction and active components involved.

本文献中描述的具有三维分散活性位点的B基材料的结构特征主要集中在以B2O3为活性组分的蜂窝状堇青石整体催化剂上。这种结构通过以下几种方式增强了催化性能：

1. 蜂窝状堇青石提供了发达的直通道，允许高气体小时空速（GHSV）和改善的传质。

2. 在堇青石壁上涂覆的薄B2O3层有助于孔扩散，从而更有效地利用催化剂。

3. 蜂窝的三维结构允许活性B2O3组分在整个催化剂中更好地分散。

将B活性组分引入这些结构的方法涉及两步涂覆过程：

1. 首先，使用TEOS水解在堇青石基底上涂覆一层SiO2。这个硅层作为媒介层，提供丰富的SiOH基团来锚定氧化硼。

2. 其次，通过使用硼酸溶液的浸渍过程，将B2O3涂覆在经SiO2修饰的堇青石上，然后进行煅烧。

这种方法对ODHP催化反应效果显著，从achieved的高丙烯选择性和低CO2产量可以证明。硅涂层改善了催化剂稳定性，同时不会对选择性产生负面影响，这是相对于其他一些SiO2负载的硼催化剂的优势。

文献中没有直接讨论这种方法对其他催化应用的有效性。然而，使用媒介层来改善活性组分的粘附性和稳定性，结合整体结构以改善传质的原理，可能适用于其他催化系统。具体的有效性将取决于特定的反应和涉及的活性组分。
