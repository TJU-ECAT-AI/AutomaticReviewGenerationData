[1] "Boron-based metal-free catalysts for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) have drawn great attention in both academia and industry due to their impressive activity and olefin selectivity."

[3] "The well-developed straight channels of honeycomb cordierite make it possible to carry out the reactor under high gas hourly space velocity (GHSV) and the thin wash-coated B2O3 layer can effectively facilitate the pore diffusion on the catalyst."

[4] "The prepared B2O3/SiO2@HC monolithic catalyst exhibits good catalytic performance at low boron oxide loading and achieves excellent propylene selectivity (86.0%), olefin selectivity (97.6%, propylene and ethylene) and negligible CO2 (0.1%) at 16.9% propane conversion under high GHSV of 345,600ml·(g B2O3)1·h1"

[5] "The catalyst structure stability remains an important inspection parameter for the monolithic catalyst that the coating layer usually detaches from the support, leading to the deactivation of catalyst"

The literature discusses B-based materials in monolithic honeycomb structures rather than 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks. However, some insights can be drawn about the structural characteristics and incorporation methods of B-based catalysts:

1. The B2O3/SiO2@HC catalyst uses a two-step coating method to incorporate boron oxide onto a cordierite honeycomb support. This creates a thin, well-dispersed B2O3 layer on the channel walls.

2. The honeycomb structure with straight channels enables high gas hourly space velocity and facilitates pore diffusion, enhancing catalytic performance.

3. SiO2 is used as a mediating layer between the cordierite substrate and B2O3, providing abundant SiOH groups to anchor the boron species. This improves the stability and dispersion of the active component.

4. The coating method allows for low B2O3 loading while maintaining good catalytic performance, indicating efficient utilization of active sites.

5. Proper calcination temperature is critical to prevent B2O3 vitrification or densification, which could reduce accessible active sites.

This coating approach on a structured support appears effective for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane, providing high selectivity and stability. However, the effectiveness for other catalytic applications is not discussed in the given literature.

这篇文献讨论的是单片蜂窝结构中的B基材料,而不是多孔框架中的3-D分散活性位点。然而,我们可以从中获得一些关于B基催化剂的结构特征和掺入方法的见解:

1. B2O3/SiO2@HC催化剂采用两步涂覆法将三氧化硼掺入堇青石蜂窝支撑体上。这在通道壁上形成了一层薄而分散均匀的B2O3层。

2. 具有直通道的蜂窝结构能够实现高空速,并促进孔扩散,从而提高催化性能。

3. SiO2被用作堇青石基底和B2O3之间的中间层,提供大量的SiOH基团来锚定硼物种。这提高了活性组分的稳定性和分散性。

4. 涂覆方法允许在低B2O3负载量的情况下保持良好的催化性能,表明活性位点得到了有效利用。

5. 适当的煅烧温度对防止B2O3玻璃化或致密化至关重要,因为这可能会减少可接触的活性位点。

这种在结构化支撑体上的涂覆方法似乎对丙烷的氧化脱氢反应很有效,提供了高选择性和稳定性。然而,该文献没有讨论这种方法对其他催化应用的有效性。
