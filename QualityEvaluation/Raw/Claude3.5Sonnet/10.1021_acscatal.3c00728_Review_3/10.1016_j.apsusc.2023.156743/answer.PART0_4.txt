[1] "BN@BPO4 self-supporting monolithic foam with oriented bowl-like structure was obtained, which is built by numerous oriented bowl-like blocks and shows a double layer structure with face-to-face opening."

[2] "Further, pure h-BN monolithic foam with oriented bowl-like structure prepared at higher temperature possessed multimodal hierarchically porous structure and excellent performance in the catalytic oxidative dehydrogenation of propane into propene and the removal of organic pollutants."

[3] "Bowl-like structures have great potential in the field of catalysis, environmental remediation, energy storage, etc., because of the large surface area, porous structure, and buffer hollow space."

[4] "We believe the as-generated h-BN can enhance the gas trapping capacity of liquid B2O3 environment foam to precisely control pressure differential between large and small bubbles and thus favors the oriented opening of bowl-like structure."

The document discusses B-based materials with 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks, specifically focusing on boron nitride (BN) structures. The structural characteristics described include:

1. Oriented bowl-like structure: The material is composed of numerous oriented bowl-like blocks arranged in a double layer structure with face-to-face openings.

2. Multimodal hierarchically porous structure: The pure h-BN monolithic foam prepared at higher temperatures exhibits this feature.

3. Large surface area, porous structure, and buffer hollow space: These characteristics are attributed to the bowl-like structures.

These structural features enhance catalytic performance by providing a large surface area for reactions, facilitating mass transfer through the porous structure, and offering buffer hollow spaces that can potentially trap and concentrate reactants.

The method used to incorporate B active components into these structures involves a self-assembly strategy at the gas/liquid interface of liquid B2O3 environment foam. The process allows for control over the opening direction of bowl-like structures and the adjustment of opening size by changing the amount of Cu(NO3)2 additives.

This method appears to be effective for creating materials with excellent performance in catalytic oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propene and the removal of organic pollutants. However, the document does not provide a comparison with other methods or discuss the relative effectiveness for different catalytic applications beyond these two examples.

该文档讨论了具有3D分散活性位点的多孔框架B基材料，特别关注了氮化硼（BN）结构。所描述的结构特征包括：

1. 定向碗状结构：材料由众多定向排列的碗状块组成，形成面对面开口的双层结构。

2. 多模态分层多孔结构：在较高温度下制备的纯h-BN整体泡沫展现了这一特征。

3. 大表面积、多孔结构和缓冲空腔：这些特征归因于碗状结构。

这些结构特征通过提供大的反应表面积、促进多孔结构中的质量传递，以及提供可能捕获和浓缩反应物的缓冲空腔来增强催化性能。

将B活性组分引入这些结构的方法涉及在液态B2O3环境泡沫的气/液界面上进行自组装策略。该过程允许控制碗状结构的开口方向，并通过改变Cu(NO3)2添加剂的量来调节开口大小。

这种方法似乎能有效地创造出在丙烷催化氧化脱氢制丙烯和去除有机污染物方面表现出色的材料。然而，该文档并未提供与其他方法的比较，也没有讨论除这两个例子之外的不同催化应用的相对有效性。
