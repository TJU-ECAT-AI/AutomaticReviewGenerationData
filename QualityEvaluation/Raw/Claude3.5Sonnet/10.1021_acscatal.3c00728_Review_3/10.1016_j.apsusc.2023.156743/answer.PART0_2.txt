The literature describes a B-based material with a 3-D dispersed structure in the form of a monolithic foam with oriented bowl-like structures. This unique structure enhances catalytic performance through several key features:

1. Oriented bowl-like blocks: The material is composed of numerous oriented bowl-like structures, creating a double layer structure with face-to-face openings. This orientation likely increases the surface area and accessibility of active sites.

2. Multimodal hierarchically porous structure: The pure h-BN monolithic foam prepared at higher temperatures possesses a multimodal hierarchically porous structure. This feature enhances mass transfer and increases the number of accessible active sites.

3. Gas trapping capacity: The h-BN component enhances the gas trapping capacity of the foam, which allows for precise control of pressure differentials between large and small bubbles. This property favors the oriented opening of the bowl-like structure, potentially improving catalytic performance by optimizing reactant-catalyst interactions.

The method used to incorporate B active components into these structures involves a self-assembly strategy at the gas/liquid interface of a liquid B2O3 environment foam. This approach allows for control over the opening direction of the bowl-like structures. The effectiveness of this method is demonstrated by the material's excellent performance in catalytic oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propene and the removal of organic pollutants.

While the literature does not provide a comparative analysis of different methods for incorporating B active components, the described approach appears to be effective for creating a highly structured, porous material with promising catalytic applications. However, more research would be needed to critically evaluate its effectiveness relative to other methods across a broader range of catalytic applications.

文献描述了一种具有3-D分散结构的B基材料，它以具有定向碗状结构的整体泡沫形式存在。这种独特的结构通过几个关键特征增强了催化性能：

1. 定向碗状块：该材料由众多定向碗状结构组成，形成面对面开口的双层结构。这种定向可能增加了表面积和活性位点的可及性。

2. 多模态层级多孔结构：在较高温度下制备的纯h-BN整体泡沫具有多模态层级多孔结构。这一特征增强了质量传递并增加了可接触的活性位点数量。

3. 气体捕获能力：h-BN组分增强了泡沫的气体捕获能力，这允许精确控制大小气泡之间的压力差。这一特性有利于碗状结构的定向开口，通过优化反应物-催化剂相互作用可能提高催化性能。

将B活性组分incorporation到这些结构中的方法涉及在液态B2O3环境泡沫的气/液界面上进行自组装策略。这种方法允许控制碗状结构的开口方向。该方法的有效性通过材料在丙烷催化氧化脱氢制丙烯和有机污染物去除方面的优异性能得到了证明。

虽然文献没有提供不同B活性组分incorporation方法的比较分析，但所描述的方法似乎能有效地创建一种高度结构化的多孔材料，具有很有前景的催化应用。然而，需要进行更多研究来严格评估其相对于其他方法在更广泛的催化应用范围内的有效性。
