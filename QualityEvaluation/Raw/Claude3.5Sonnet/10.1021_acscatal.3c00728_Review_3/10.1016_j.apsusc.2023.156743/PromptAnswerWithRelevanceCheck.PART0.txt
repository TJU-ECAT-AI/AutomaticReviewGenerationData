[1] "BN@BPO4 self-supporting monolithic foam with oriented bowl-like structure was obtained, which is built by numerous oriented bowl-like blocks and shows a double layer structure with face-to-face opening."

[2] "Further, pure h-BN monolithic foam with oriented bowl-like structure prepared at higher temperature possessed multimodal hierarchically porous structure and excellent performance in the catalytic oxidative dehydrogenation of propane into propene and the removal of organic pollutants."

[3] "We believe the as-generated h-BN can enhance the gas trapping capacity of liquid B2O3 environment foam to precisely control pressure differential between large and small bubbles and thus favors the oriented opening of bowl-like structure."

</quotes>

The literature describes B-based materials with 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks, specifically BN@BPO4 and h-BN monolithic foams with oriented bowl-like structures. These materials exhibit several structural characteristics that enhance catalytic performance:

1. Oriented bowl-like structure: The materials are built from numerous oriented bowl-like blocks, creating a double layer structure with face-to-face openings. This orientation likely increases the accessible surface area and improves mass transfer.

2. Multimodal hierarchically porous structure: The pure h-BN monolithic foam prepared at higher temperatures possesses a multimodal hierarchically porous structure, which can enhance diffusion of reactants and products, as well as provide more active sites for catalysis.

3. Self-supporting monolithic foam: The BN@BPO4 material is described as a self-supporting monolithic foam, which suggests good mechanical stability and potential for practical applications.

The method used to incorporate B active components into these structures involves a self-assembly strategy at the gas/liquid interface of liquid B2O3 environment foam. This approach allows for control over the opening direction of bowl-like structures. The addition of Cu(NO3)2 is mentioned as a way to adjust the opening size and promote the production of h-BN.

The effectiveness of this method is demonstrated by the excellent performance of the resulting materials in catalytic oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propene and the removal of organic pollutants. However, the literature does not provide comparative data on the effectiveness of this method for different catalytic applications, making it difficult to critically evaluate its relative effectiveness across various reactions.

该文献描述了具有3-D分散活性位点的多孔框架B基材料，特别是具有定向碗状结构的BN@BPO4和h-BN整体泡沫。这些材料表现出几个增强催化性能的结构特征：

1. 定向碗状结构：材料由众多定向碗状块构建而成，形成面对面开口的双层结构。这种定向可能会增加可接触的表面积并改善物质传递。

2. 多模态分级多孔结构：在更高温度下制备的纯h-BN整体泡沫具有多模态分级多孔结构，这可以增强反应物和产物的扩散，并提供更多的催化活性位点。

3. 自支撑整体泡沫：BN@BPO4材料被描述为自支撑整体泡沫，这表明其具有良好的机械稳定性和实际应用潜力。

将B活性组分纳入这些结构的方法涉及在液态B2O3环境泡沫的气/液界面进行自组装策略。这种方法允许控制碗状结构的开口方向。提到添加Cu(NO3)2可以调节开口大小并促进h-BN的生成。

该方法的有效性通过所得材料在丙烷催化氧化脱氢生成丙烯和去除有机污染物方面的优异性能得到了证明。然而，文献并未提供该方法在不同催化应用中的有效性比较数据，因此很难对其在各种反应中的相对有效性进行批判性评估。

The literature describes B-based materials with 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks, specifically focusing on boron nitride (BN) structures. The key structural characteristics that enhance catalytic performance include:

1. Oriented bowl-like structure: The material is composed of numerous oriented bowl-like blocks arranged in a double layer structure with face-to-face openings.

2. Multimodal hierarchically porous structure: The pure h-BN monolithic foam prepared at higher temperatures exhibits a multimodal hierarchically porous structure.

3. Large surface area: The bowl-like structures provide a large surface area, which is beneficial for catalytic applications.

4. Porous structure: The material's porous nature contributes to its effectiveness in catalysis and other applications.

5. Buffer hollow space: The bowl-like structures create buffer hollow spaces, which can be advantageous for certain catalytic processes.

These structural features enhance catalytic performance by providing more active sites, improving mass transfer, and allowing for better interaction between reactants and catalysts.

The method used to incorporate B active components into these structures involves a self-assembly strategy at the gas/liquid interface of liquid B2O3 environment foam. This approach allows for the controlled synthesis of BN-based monolithic foam with a directional bowl-like structure on the extended assembly interface. The effectiveness of this method is demonstrated by the excellent performance of the resulting material in catalytic oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propene and the removal of organic pollutants.

While the literature does not provide a comparative analysis of different methods for incorporating B active components, it highlights the success of this particular approach in creating a material with desirable structural characteristics and catalytic properties.

The literature describes a B-based material with a 3-D dispersed structure in the form of a monolithic foam with oriented bowl-like structures. This unique structure enhances catalytic performance through several key features:

1. Oriented bowl-like blocks: The material is composed of numerous oriented bowl-like structures, creating a double layer structure with face-to-face openings. This orientation likely increases the surface area and accessibility of active sites.

2. Multimodal hierarchically porous structure: The pure h-BN monolithic foam prepared at higher temperatures possesses a multimodal hierarchically porous structure. This feature enhances mass transfer and increases the number of accessible active sites.

3. Gas trapping capacity: The h-BN component enhances the gas trapping capacity of the foam, which allows for precise control of pressure differentials between large and small bubbles. This property favors the oriented opening of the bowl-like structure, potentially improving catalytic performance by optimizing reactant-catalyst interactions.

The method used to incorporate B active components into these structures involves a self-assembly strategy at the gas/liquid interface of a liquid B2O3 environment foam. This approach allows for control over the opening direction of the bowl-like structures. The effectiveness of this method is demonstrated by the material's excellent performance in catalytic oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propene and the removal of organic pollutants.

While the literature does not provide a comparative analysis of different methods for incorporating B active components, the described approach appears to be effective for creating a highly structured, porous material with promising catalytic applications. However, more research would be needed to critically evaluate its effectiveness relative to other methods across a broader range of catalytic applications.
