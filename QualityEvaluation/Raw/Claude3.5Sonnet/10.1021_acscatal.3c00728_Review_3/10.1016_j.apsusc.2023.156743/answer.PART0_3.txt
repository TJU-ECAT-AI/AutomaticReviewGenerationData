[1] "BN@BPO4 self-supporting monolithic foam with oriented bowl-like structure was obtained, which is built by numerous oriented bowl-like blocks and shows a double layer structure with face-to-face opening."

[2] "Further, pure h-BN monolithic foam with oriented bowl-like structure prepared at higher temperature possessed multimodal hierarchically porous structure and excellent performance in the catalytic oxidative dehydrogenation of propane into propene and the removal of organic pollutants."

[3] "We believe the as-generated h-BN can enhance the gas trapping capacity of liquid B2O3 environment foam to precisely control pressure differential between large and small bubbles and thus favors the oriented opening of bowl-like structure."

The literature discusses a B-based material with a 3-D dispersed active site structure in a porous framework, specifically a BN@BPO4 self-supporting monolithic foam with an oriented bowl-like structure. This structure enhances catalytic performance through several features:

1. Oriented bowl-like blocks: The material is composed of numerous oriented bowl-like structures, which likely increase the surface area and create a unique spatial arrangement of active sites.

2. Double layer structure: The face-to-face opening of the double layer structure may facilitate mass transfer and increase accessibility to active sites.

3. Multimodal hierarchically porous structure: This feature, present in the pure h-BN monolithic foam, can enhance diffusion of reactants and products, improving overall catalytic efficiency.

4. Gas trapping capacity: The h-BN component enhances gas trapping, which may contribute to better control of reaction conditions and improved catalytic performance.

The method used to incorporate B active components involves a self-assembly strategy at the gas/liquid interface of a liquid B2O3 environment foam. This approach appears to be effective for creating oriented bowl-like structures with controllable opening sizes. The effectiveness of this method is demonstrated by the excellent performance of the resulting material in catalytic oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propene and organic pollutant removal.

However, the literature does not provide a comprehensive comparison of this method with other approaches for incorporating B active components into porous frameworks. Therefore, it is difficult to critically evaluate its relative effectiveness for different catalytic applications beyond the specific examples mentioned.

这篇文献讨论了一种在多孔框架中具有三维分散活性位点结构的B基材料，具体是一种具有定向碗状结构的BN@BPO4自支撑整体泡沫。这种结构通过以下几个特征增强了催化性能：

1. 定向碗状块：该材料由众多定向碗状结构组成，可能增加表面积并创造活性位点的独特空间排列。

2. 双层结构：双层结构的面对面开口可能有助于质量传递并增加活性位点的可及性。

3. 多模态分层多孔结构：这一特征存在于纯h-BN整体泡沫中，可以增强反应物和产物的扩散，提高整体催化效率。

4. 气体捕获能力：h-BN组分增强了气体捕获能力，这可能有助于更好地控制反应条件并提高催化性能。

用于引入B活性组分的方法涉及在液态B2O3环境泡沫的气/液界面上进行自组装策略。这种方法似乎能有效地创造出具有可控开口尺寸的定向碗状结构。该方法的有效性通过所得材料在丙烷催化氧化脱氢制丙烯和有机污染物去除方面的优异性能得到了证明。

然而，文献没有提供这种方法与其他将B活性组分引入多孔框架的方法的全面比较。因此，很难对其在除所提到的特定例子之外的不同催化应用中的相对有效性进行批判性评估。
