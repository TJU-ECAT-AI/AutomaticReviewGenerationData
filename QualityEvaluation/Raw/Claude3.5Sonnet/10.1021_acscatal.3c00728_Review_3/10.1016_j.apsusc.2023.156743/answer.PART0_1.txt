The literature describes B-based materials with 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks, specifically focusing on boron nitride (BN) structures. The key structural characteristics that enhance catalytic performance include:

1. Oriented bowl-like structure: The material is composed of numerous oriented bowl-like blocks arranged in a double layer structure with face-to-face openings.

2. Multimodal hierarchically porous structure: The pure h-BN monolithic foam prepared at higher temperatures exhibits a multimodal hierarchically porous structure.

3. Large surface area: The bowl-like structures provide a large surface area, which is beneficial for catalytic applications.

4. Porous structure: The material's porous nature contributes to its effectiveness in catalysis and other applications.

5. Buffer hollow space: The bowl-like structures create buffer hollow spaces, which can be advantageous for certain catalytic processes.

These structural features enhance catalytic performance by providing more active sites, improving mass transfer, and allowing for better interaction between reactants and catalysts.

The method used to incorporate B active components into these structures involves a self-assembly strategy at the gas/liquid interface of liquid B2O3 environment foam. This approach allows for the controlled synthesis of BN-based monolithic foam with a directional bowl-like structure on the extended assembly interface. The effectiveness of this method is demonstrated by the excellent performance of the resulting material in catalytic oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propene and the removal of organic pollutants.

While the literature does not provide a comparative analysis of different methods for incorporating B active components, it highlights the success of this particular approach in creating a material with desirable structural characteristics and catalytic properties.

该文献描述了具有三维分散活性位点的多孔框架B基材料，特别关注了氮化硼（BN）结构。提高催化性能的主要结构特征包括：

1. 定向碗状结构：该材料由众多定向排列的碗状块组成，形成面对面开口的双层结构。

2. 多模态分级多孔结构：在较高温度下制备的纯h-BN整体泡沫exhib呈现多模态分级多孔结构。

3. 大比表面积：碗状结构提供了大的表面积，这对催化应用有利。

4. 多孔结构：材料的多孔性有助于其在催化和其他应用中的效果。

5. 缓冲空腔：碗状结构创造了缓冲空腔，这对某些催化过程可能有利。

这些结构特征通过提供更多的活性位点、改善质量传递以及允许反应物与催化剂之间更好的相互作用来提高催化性能。

将B活性组分引入这些结构的方法涉及在液态B2O3环境泡沫的气/液界面上进行自组装策略。这种方法允许在扩展的组装界面上控制合成具有定向碗状结构的BN基整体泡沫。该方法的有效性通过所得材料在丙烷催化氧化脱氢制丙烯和有机污染物去除方面的优异性能得到了证明。

尽管文献没有提供不同B活性组分引入方法的比较分析，但它强调了这种特定方法在创造具有理想结构特征和催化性能的材料方面的成功。
