          [1] "BN@BPO4 self-supporting monolithic foam with oriented bowl-like structure was obtained, which is built by numerous oriented bowl-like blocks and shows a double layer structure with face-to-face opening."

[2] "Further, pure h-BN monolithic foam with oriented bowl-like structure prepared at higher temperature possessed multimodal hierarchically porous structure and excellent performance in the catalytic oxidative dehydrogenation of propane into propene and the removal of organic pollutants."

[3] "Bowl-like structures have great potential in the field of catalysis, environmental remediation, energy storage, etc., because of the large surface area, porous structure, and buffer hollow space."

[4] "We believe the as-generated h-BN can enhance the gas trapping capacity of liquid B2O3 environment foam to precisely control pressure differential between large and small bubbles and thus favors the oriented opening of bowl-like structure."

          The structural characteristics of B-based materials with 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks include:

1. Oriented bowl-like structure: The materials are composed of numerous oriented bowl-like blocks arranged in a double layer structure with face-to-face openings.

2. Multimodal hierarchically porous structure: This feature is present in pure h-BN monolithic foam prepared at higher temperatures.

3. Large surface area: The bowl-like structures provide a large surface area for catalytic reactions.

4. Porous structure: The materials exhibit a porous nature, enhancing mass transfer and accessibility of active sites.

5. Buffer hollow space: The bowl-like structures create buffer hollow spaces, which can be advantageous for certain catalytic processes.

These structural features enhance catalytic performance by:
- Increasing the number of accessible active sites
- Improving mass transfer of reactants and products
- Facilitating better interaction between reactants and catalysts
- Potentially trapping and concentrating reactants in buffer hollow spaces

The method used to incorporate B active components into these structures involves a self-assembly strategy at the gas/liquid interface of liquid B2O3 environment foam. This approach allows for:
- Control over the opening direction of bowl-like structures
- Adjustment of opening size by changing the amount of Cu(NO3)2 additives
- Enhancement of gas trapping capacity, which helps control pressure differentials between bubbles and favors the oriented opening of bowl-like structures

The effectiveness of this method is demonstrated by the excellent performance of the resulting materials in:
- Catalytic oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propene
- Removal of organic pollutants

However, the literature does not provide a comprehensive comparison of this method with other approaches for incorporating B active components into porous frameworks. Therefore, it is difficult to critically evaluate its relative effectiveness for different catalytic applications beyond the specific examples mentioned.

          具有3-D分散活性位点的多孔框架B基材料的结构特征包括：

1. 定向碗状结构：材料由众多定向排列的碗状块组成，形成面对面开口的双层结构。

2. 多模态分层多孔结构：在较高温度下制备的纯h-BN整体泡沫中存在这一特征。

3. 大表面积：碗状结构提供了大的表面积用于催化反应。

4. 多孔结构：材料表现出多孔性，增强了质量传递和活性位点的可及性。

5. 缓冲空腔：碗状结构创造了缓冲空腔，这对某些催化过程可能有利。

这些结构特征通过以下方式增强催化性能：
- 增加可接触的活性位点数量
- 改善反应物和产物的质量传递
- 促进反应物与催化剂之间更好的相互作用
- 可能在缓冲空腔中捕获和浓缩反应物

将B活性组分引入这些结构的方法涉及在液态B2O3环境泡沫的气/液界面上进行自组装策略。这种方法可以：
- 控制碗状结构的开口方向
- 通过改变Cu(NO3)2添加剂的量来调节开口大小
- 增强气体捕获能力，这有助于控制气泡之间的压力差，有利于碗状结构的定向开口

该方法的有效性通过所得材料在以下方面的优异性能得到了证明：
- 丙烷催化氧化脱氢制丙烯
- 有机污染物的去除

然而，文献没有提供这种方法与其他将B活性组分引入多孔框架的方法的全面比较。因此，很难对其在除所提到的特定例子之外的不同催化应用中的相对有效性进行批判性评估。
