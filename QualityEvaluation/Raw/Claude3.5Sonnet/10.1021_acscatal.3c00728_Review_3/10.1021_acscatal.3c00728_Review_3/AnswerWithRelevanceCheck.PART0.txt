          [1] "The B-based materials with 3-D dispersed active sites generally exhibit porous structures and high specific surface areas."

[2] "The high specific surface area and suitable pore volume provide abundant sites to accommodate the active B species and confined space that influences the reaction behavior of radicals."

[3] "Loading the B active components on the surface of the 3-D porous structure or doping them into the 3-D framework of the porous materials constitutes an effective method to construct 3-D B active sites."

[4] "By doping B species into zeolite frameworks, a 3-D dispersion of the B active site can be achieved."

[5] "The loading of B active species in the 3-D porous materials or doping into the zeolite frameworks not only provides a higher utility of B active sites but also constructs confined space which regulates the reaction behaviors of active radical intermediates and mass transport behaviors"

[6] "The introduction of confined walls is able to directly increase the wall termination possibility of the gas-phase radicals, which exhibits a negative effect on the reaction rate."

[7] "As the confinement also influences the diffusion of reactants, radical intermediates, and products, predicting the net effect of the 3-D dispersion of active sites on the apparent catalytic performances is difficult."

[8] "The 3-D pore structure of zeolite played an important role in the conversion of propane, which could affect the mass and heat transport."

[9] "The suitable 3-D pore structures render ordered macroporous boron phosphate a very promising catalyst for propane oxidative dehydrogenation, and it is expected to meet the industrial standard."

          B-based materials with 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks are characterized by:

1. Porous structures with high specific surface areas
2. Suitable pore volumes that accommodate active B species
3. Confined spaces that influence radical reaction behavior and mass transport

These structural features enhance catalytic performance by:

1. Providing abundant sites for active B species
2. Regulating reaction behaviors of active radical intermediates
3. Controlling mass and heat transport behaviors

Methods used to incorporate B active components into these structures include:

1. Loading B active components on the surface of 3-D porous structures
2. Doping B species into the 3-D framework of porous materials (e.g., zeolites)
3. Synthesizing ordered macroporous boron-containing materials (e.g., boron phosphate)

The effectiveness of these methods varies:

1. Both loading and doping approaches increase the utility of B active sites
2. They create confined spaces that can both positively and negatively affect reactions
3. Doping B species into zeolite frameworks appears particularly effective for creating well-dispersed active sites
4. Synthesizing ordered macroporous structures shows promise for industrial applications due to improved mass and heat transfer properties

Critical evaluation:

1. The confined walls can increase wall termination of gas-phase radicals, potentially reducing reaction rates
2. Confinement influences diffusion of reactants, intermediates, and products
3. The interplay between surface-mediated and gas-phase pathways makes optimization challenging
4. The net effect on catalytic performance is complex and difficult to predict
5. Each method has its advantages and limitations, and the choice depends on the specific catalytic requirements
6. Further research is needed to optimize these methods for different catalytic processes and to better understand the relationship between 3-D structure and catalytic performance

Overall, while 3-D dispersed active sites offer promising advantages, their effectiveness depends on carefully balancing various factors to achieve optimal catalytic performance for specific applications.

          具有3-D分散活性位点的B基材料在多孔框架中的结构特征包括：

1. 具有高比表面积的多孔结构
2. 适当的孔体积，可容纳活性B物种
3. 影响自由基反应行为和质量传输的受限空间

这些结构特征通过以下方式增强催化性能：

1. 为活性B物种提供丰富的位点
2. 调节活性自由基中间体的反应行为
3. 控制质量和热传输行为

将B活性组分引入这些结构的方法包括：

1. 将B活性组分负载在3-D多孔结构表面
2. 将B物种掺杂到多孔材料的3-D框架中（如沸石）
3. 合成有序大孔硼含材料（如硼酸盐）

这些方法的有效性各不相同：

1. 负载和掺杂方法都增加了B活性位点的利用率
2. 它们创造了可以对反应产生正面和负面影响的受限空间
3. 将B物种掺杂到沸石框架中似乎特别有效，可以创建分散良好的活性位点
4. 合成有序大孔结构由于改善了质量和热传递性质，显示出工业应用的前景

批评性评估：

1. 受限的壁可以增加气相自由基的壁终止，可能会降低反应速率
2. 限制影响反应物、中间体和产物的扩散
3. 表面介导和气相途径之间的相互作用使优化变得具有挑战性
4. 对催化性能的净效果是复杂的，难以预测
5. 每种方法都有其优缺点，选择取决于特定的催化要求
6. 需要进一步研究来优化这些方法用于不同的催化过程，并更好地理解3-D结构与催化性能之间的关系

总的来说，虽然3-D分散活性位点提供了有前景的优势，但其有效性取决于仔细平衡各种因素，以实现特定应用的最佳催化性能。
