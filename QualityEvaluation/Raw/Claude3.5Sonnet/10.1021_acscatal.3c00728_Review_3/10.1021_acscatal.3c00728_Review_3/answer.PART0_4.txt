B-based materials with 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks are characterized by:

1. Porous structures and high specific surface areas
2. Abundant sites to accommodate active B species
3. Confined spaces that influence radical reaction behavior
4. Ability to affect mass and heat transport

These structural features enhance catalytic performance by:

1. Providing more active sites for reactions
2. Influencing radical behavior in confined spaces
3. Improving mass and heat transfer

Methods to incorporate B active components into these structures include:

1. Loading B components on the surface of 3-D porous structures
2. Doping B species into the 3-D framework of porous materials (e.g., zeolites)
3. Synthesizing ordered macroporous boron-containing materials (e.g., boron phosphate)

The effectiveness of these methods varies depending on the catalytic application. Doping B species into zeolite frameworks appears to be particularly effective for creating well-dispersed active sites. Loading B components on porous surfaces can achieve high B loadings but may be less stable. Synthesizing ordered macroporous structures shows promise for industrial applications due to improved mass and heat transfer properties.

Each method has its advantages and limitations, and the choice depends on the specific catalytic requirements, such as desired activity, selectivity, and stability. Further research is needed to optimize these methods for different catalytic processes and to better understand the relationship between 3-D structure and catalytic performance.

具有3-D分散活性位点的B基材料在多孔框架中的结构特征包括：

1. 多孔结构和高比表面积
2. 丰富的活性B物种容纳位点
3. 影响自由基反应行为的受限空间
4. 能够影响质量和热传递

这些结构特征通过以下方式增强催化性能：

1. 提供更多的反应活性位点
2. 在受限空间中影响自由基行为
3. 改善质量和热传递

将B活性组分引入这些结构的方法包括：

1. 将B组分负载在3-D多孔结构表面
2. 将B物种掺杂到多孔材料的3-D框架中（如沸石）
3. 合成有序大孔硼含材料（如硼酸盐）

这些方法的有效性因催化应用而异。将B物种掺杂到沸石框架中似乎特别有效，可以创建分散良好的活性位点。在多孔表面上负载B组分可以实现高B负载，但可能稳定性较差。合成有序大孔结构由于改善了质量和热传递性质，显示出工业应用的前景。

每种方法都有其优缺点，选择取决于特定的催化要求，如所需的活性、选择性和稳定性。需要进一步研究以优化这些方法用于不同的催化过程，并更好地理解3-D结构与催化性能之间的关系。
