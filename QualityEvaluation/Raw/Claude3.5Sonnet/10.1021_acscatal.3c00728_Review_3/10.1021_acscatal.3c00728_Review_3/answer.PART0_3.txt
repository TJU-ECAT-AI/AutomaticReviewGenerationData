[1] "The B-based materials with 3-D dispersed active sites generally exhibit porous structures and high specific surface areas."

[2] "The high specific surface area and suitable pore volume provide abundant sites to accommodate the active B species and confined space that influences the reaction behavior of radicals."

[3] "Loading the B active components on the surface of the 3-D porous structure or doping them into the 3-D framework of the porous materials constitutes an effective method to construct 3-D B active sites."

[4] "The loading of B active species in the 3-D porous materials or doping into the zeolite frameworks not only provides a higher utility of B active sites but also constructs confined space which regulates the reaction behaviors of active radical intermediates and mass transport behaviors"

[5] "The introduction of confined walls is able to directly increase the wall termination possibility of the gas-phase radicals, which exhibits a negative effect on the reaction rate."

[6] "As the confinement also influences the diffusion of reactants, radical intermediates, and products, predicting the net effect of the 3-D dispersion of active sites on the apparent catalytic performances is difficult."

B-based materials with 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks are characterized by:

1. Porous structures with high specific surface areas
2. Suitable pore volumes that accommodate active B species
3. Confined spaces that influence radical reaction behavior and mass transport

These structural features enhance catalytic performance by:

1. Providing abundant sites for active B species
2. Regulating reaction behaviors of active radical intermediates
3. Controlling mass transport behaviors

Methods used to incorporate B active components into these structures include:

1. Loading B active components on the surface of 3-D porous structures
2. Doping B active components into the 3-D framework of porous materials

The effectiveness of these methods varies:

1. Both approaches increase the utility of B active sites
2. They create confined spaces that can both positively and negatively affect reactions
3. The net effect on catalytic performance is complex and difficult to predict

Critical evaluation:

1. The confined walls can increase wall termination of gas-phase radicals, potentially reducing reaction rates
2. Confinement influences diffusion of reactants, intermediates, and products
3. The interplay between surface-mediated and gas-phase pathways makes optimization challenging
4. Further research is needed to decouple the multiple parameters involved in these complex systems

Overall, while 3-D dispersed active sites offer promising advantages, their effectiveness depends on carefully balancing various factors to achieve optimal catalytic performance for specific applications.

具有3-D分散活性位点的多孔框架B基材料的特征包括：

1. 具有高比表面积的多孔结构
2. 适当的孔体积，可容纳活性B物种
3. 影响自由基反应行为和质量传输的受限空间

这些结构特征通过以下方式增强催化性能：

1. 为活性B物种提供丰富的位点
2. 调节活性自由基中间体的反应行为
3. 控制质量传输行为

将B活性组分引入这些结构的方法包括：

1. 将B活性组分负载在3-D多孔结构表面
2. 将B活性组分掺杂到多孔材料的3-D框架中

这些方法的有效性各不相同：

1. 两种方法都增加了B活性位点的利用率
2. 它们创造了可以对反应产生正面和负面影响的受限空间
3. 对催化性能的净效果是复杂的，难以预测

批评性评估：

1. 受限的壁可以增加气相自由基的壁终止，可能会降低反应速率
2. 限制影响反应物、中间体和产物的扩散
3. 表面介导和气相途径之间的相互作用使优化变得具有挑战性
4. 需要进一步研究来解耦这些复杂系统中涉及的多个参数

总的来说，虽然3-D分散活性位点提供了有前景的优势，但其有效性取决于仔细平衡各种因素，以实现特定应用的最佳催化性能。
