B-based materials with 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks typically feature high specific surface areas and porous structures. These characteristics enhance catalytic performance in several ways:

1. Increased active site density: The high surface area and pore volume provide abundant sites for accommodating active B species, leading to a higher concentration of catalytic centers.

2. Confinement effects: The porous structure creates confined spaces that influence the behavior of radicals and intermediates during reactions, potentially improving selectivity and efficiency.

3. Improved mass transport: The 3-D porous structure can regulate mass transport behaviors, facilitating the movement of reactants and products throughout the catalyst.

Two main methods are used to incorporate B active components into these structures:

1. Loading B active components on the surface of 3-D porous structures: This method allows for high dispersion of B species on the external and internal surfaces of the support material.

2. Doping B species into the 3-D framework of porous materials: This approach integrates B atoms directly into the structure of materials like zeolites, creating isolated active sites within the framework.

Both methods can be effective, but their relative effectiveness depends on the specific catalytic application:

- Surface loading may be more suitable for reactions requiring high accessibility of active sites and when the support material's properties are crucial for the overall catalytic performance.

- Framework doping can be particularly effective for shape-selective catalysis and when isolated B sites are desired, as demonstrated by the improved performance of some B-doped zeolites in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reactions.

The choice between these methods should consider factors such as the desired active site distribution, the nature of the catalytic reaction, and the stability requirements of the catalyst under reaction conditions.

具有3-D分散活性位点的B基材料在多孔框架中通常具有高比表面积和多孔结构。这些特征通过以下几种方式增强了催化性能：

1. 增加活性位点密度：高表面积和孔隙体积为活性B物种提供了大量位点，从而增加了催化中心的浓度。

2. 限域效应：多孔结构创造了限制空间，影响反应过程中自由基和中间体的行为，可能提高选择性和效率。

3. 改善质量传输：3-D多孔结构可以调节质量传输行为，促进反应物和产物在催化剂中的移动。

将B活性组分纳入这些结构的两种主要方法是：

1. 将B活性组分负载在3-D多孔结构的表面上：这种方法允许B物种在支撑材料的外部和内部表面上高度分散。

2. 将B物种掺杂到多孔材料的3-D框架中：这种方法将B原子直接整合到诸如沸石等材料的结构中，在框架内创建孤立的活性位点。

这两种方法都可能有效，但它们的相对有效性取决于具体的催化应用：

- 表面负载可能更适合于需要高度可及性活性位点的反应，以及当支撑材料的性质对整体催化性能至关重要时。

- 框架掺杂对于形状选择性催化特别有效，当需要孤立的B位点时也很有用，正如某些B掺杂沸石在丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）反应中表现出的改进性能所示。

在这些方法之间进行选择时，应考虑诸如所需的活性位点分布、催化反应的性质以及催化剂在反应条件下的稳定性要求等因素。
