B-based materials with 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks are characterized by:

1. Porous structures and high specific surface areas
2. Abundant sites for active B species
3. Confined spaces that influence radical behavior
4. Regulated mass transport

These structural features enhance catalytic performance by:

1. Increasing the density and availability of active sites
2. Providing confined spaces that regulate reaction behavior of radicals
3. Improving mass transport and reactant/product diffusion

Methods to incorporate B active components into 3-D porous structures include:

1. Loading B components on the surface of 3-D porous structures
2. Doping B species into zeolite frameworks

The effectiveness of these methods varies depending on the specific catalytic application. Surface loading may be more suitable for reactions requiring easy access to active sites, while framework doping may be preferable for reactions benefiting from shape selectivity or confinement effects. The choice between these methods should consider factors such as desired active site density, pore structure requirements, and the nature of the catalytic reaction.

Both methods have shown promise in enhancing catalytic performance, but each has its own advantages and limitations. Surface loading may offer easier preparation and higher flexibility in tuning the active site concentration, while framework doping may provide better stability and more uniform distribution of active sites. The optimal method will depend on the specific requirements of the catalytic process and the desired properties of the final catalyst.

具有3-D分散活性位点的B基材料在多孔框架中的结构特征包括：

1. 多孔结构和高比表面积
2. 丰富的活性B物种位点
3. 影响自由基行为的受限空间
4. 受调节的质量传输

这些结构特征通过以下方式增强催化性能：

1. 增加活性位点的密度和可用性
2. 提供调节自由基反应行为的受限空间
3. 改善质量传输和反应物/产物扩散

将B活性组分引入3-D多孔结构的方法包括：

1. 将B组分负载在3-D多孔结构表面
2. 将B物种掺杂到沸石骨架中

这些方法的有效性因具体催化应用而异。表面负载可能更适合需要易于接触活性位点的反应，而骨架掺杂可能更适合受益于形状选择性或限域效应的反应。在这些方法之间的选择应考虑所需的活性位点密度、孔结构要求和催化反应的性质等因素。

这两种方法都显示出增强催化性能的潜力，但各有优缺点。表面负载可能提供更容易的制备和更高的活性位点浓度调节灵活性，而骨架掺杂可能提供更好的稳定性和更均匀的活性位点分布。最佳方法将取决于催化过程的具体要求和最终催化剂的期望性能。
