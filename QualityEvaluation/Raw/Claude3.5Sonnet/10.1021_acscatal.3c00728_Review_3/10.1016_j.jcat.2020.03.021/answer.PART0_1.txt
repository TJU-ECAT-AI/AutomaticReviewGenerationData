The B-based materials with 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks exhibit several structural characteristics that enhance catalytic performance:

1. Large internal surface areas and micropores of molecular dimensions, which provide abundant active sites and facilitate mass transfer.

2. High thermal stability, allowing for reactions at elevated temperatures.

3. Incorporation of boron into the zeolite framework, creating both trigonal and tetrahedral coordinated boron species.

4. Presence of defective trigonal boron structures (B[3]a and B[3]b), which are postulated to be the active sites for oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) reactions.

The methods used to incorporate B active components into these structures include:

1. Hydrothermal synthesis of layered borosilicate zeolites, which allows for the controlled introduction of boron into the framework.

2. Calcination treatment to remove templating agents and create the final porous structure.

These methods are effective for creating catalysts for ODH reactions, as evidenced by the high activity and selectivity reported in the study. The hydrothermal synthesis method allows for precise control of boron content and distribution within the zeolite structure, which is crucial for optimizing catalytic performance.

However, the effectiveness of these methods may vary for different catalytic applications. For reactions that require different types of active sites or pore structures, alternative synthesis methods or post-synthesis modifications might be necessary. Additionally, the stability of the boron species under different reaction conditions should be considered when evaluating the suitability of these materials for other catalytic applications.

含有三维分散活性位点的B基多孔框架材料具有以下几个增强催化性能的结构特征：

1. 大的内部表面积和分子尺寸的微孔，提供了丰富的活性位点并促进了物质传递。

2. 高热稳定性，允许在高温下进行反应。

3. 将硼掺入沸石框架中，形成三配位和四配位的硼物种。

4. 存在缺陷型三配位硼结构（B[3]a和B[3]b），被认为是氧化脱氢（ODH）反应的活性位点。

将B活性组分引入这些结构的方法包括：

1. 水热合成层状硼硅沸石，可以控制地将硼引入框架。

2. 煅烧处理以去除模板剂并形成最终的多孔结构。

这些方法对于创建ODH反应催化剂是有效的，研究报告的高活性和选择性证明了这一点。水热合成方法允许精确控制沸石结构中的硼含量和分布，这对于优化催化性能至关重要。

然而，这些方法对不同催化应用的有效性可能会有所不同。对于需要不同类型活性位点或孔结构的反应，可能需要替代的合成方法或合成后修饰。此外，在评估这些材料对其他催化应用的适用性时，应考虑不同反应条件下硼物种的稳定性。
