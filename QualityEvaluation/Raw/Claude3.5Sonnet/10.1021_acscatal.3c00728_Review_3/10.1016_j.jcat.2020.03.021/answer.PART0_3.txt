[4] "The bands at 1405 and 926 cm1 were assigned to trigonally and tetrahedrally coordinated boron respectively"

[5] "One-dimensional 11B MAS NMR were performed to distinguish the B species and identify the active sites. Each spectrum can be deconvoluted into five peaks with chemical shifts at ca.18, 15, 11, 0 and 2.8 ppm."

[6] "Sites B[3]b and B[3]c were assigned to framework B(OSi)xOH3-x(x=1,2) and B(OSi)3 structure"

The B-based materials with 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks described in this study are layered borosilicate zeolites. These materials enhance catalytic performance through several structural characteristics:

1. Large internal surface areas and micropores of molecular dimensions, providing high accessibility to reactants.

2. High thermal stability, allowing for reactions at elevated temperatures.

3. Incorporation of boron into the zeolite framework, creating active sites for catalysis.

4. Presence of both trigonally and tetrahedrally coordinated boron species, offering different types of active sites.

5. Specific boron species (B[3]a and B[3]b) identified as responsible for oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) activity.

The method used to incorporate B active components into these structures was hydrothermal synthesis, followed by calcination to remove templating agents. This approach appears effective for creating a range of boron species within the zeolite framework, including both trigonal and tetrahedral coordinations.

The effectiveness of this incorporation method for catalytic applications is demonstrated by the material's performance in propane ODH. The catalysts showed good stability and high selectivity towards desired products (propylene and ethylene). The ability to tune the boron content and the resulting distribution of boron species allows for optimization of catalytic performance.

However, the study focuses primarily on ODH reactions. To fully evaluate the effectiveness of this incorporation method for different catalytic applications, further research would be needed on a broader range of reactions. Additionally, comparing this method to other approaches for incorporating boron into porous frameworks would provide a more comprehensive assessment of its relative effectiveness.

本研究中描述的具有三维分散活性位点的多孔框架B基材料是层状硼硅沸石。这些材料通过几个结构特征增强催化性能：

1. 大的内部表面积和分子尺寸的微孔，为反应物提供高可及性。

2. 高热稳定性，允许在高温下进行反应。

3. 硼掺入沸石框架，创造催化活性位点。

4. 同时存在三配位和四配位硼物种，提供不同类型的活性位点。

5. 确定特定的硼物种（B[3]a和B[3]b）负责氧化脱氢（ODH）活性。

将B活性组分掺入这些结构的方法是水热合成，然后煅烧去除模板剂。这种方法似乎能有效地在沸石框架内创造出各种硼物种，包括三配位和四配位配位。

这种掺入方法对催化应用的有效性通过材料在丙烷ODH中的性能得到了证明。催化剂表现出良好的稳定性和对目标产物（丙烯和乙烯）的高选择性。能够调节硼含量和由此产生的硼物种分布，允许优化催化性能。

然而，该研究主要集中在ODH反应上。为了全面评估这种掺入方法对不同催化应用的有效性，需要对更广泛的反应进行进一步研究。此外，将这种方法与其他将硼掺入多孔框架的方法进行比较，将提供对其相对有效性更全面的评估。
