The B-based materials with 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks exhibit several structural characteristics that enhance catalytic performance:

1. Large internal surface areas and micropores of molecular dimensions, which provide abundant active sites and facilitate mass transport.

2. High thermal stability, allowing the catalysts to withstand harsh reaction conditions.

3. Incorporation of boron into the zeolite framework, creating various boron species with different coordination environments.

4. Presence of both trigonal and tetrahedral boron species, with at least five major types identified: B[3]a, B[3]b, B[3]c, B[4]a, and B[4]b.

5. Trigonal boron species (B[3]a, B[3]b, B[3]c) are believed to be the active sites for oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) reactions.

These structural features enhance catalytic performance by providing a high concentration of accessible active sites, improving thermal stability, and allowing for tailored reactivity through different boron coordination environments.

The methods used to incorporate B active components into these structures include:

1. Hydrothermal synthesis of layered borosilicate zeolites.
2. Direct incorporation of boron into the zeolite framework during synthesis.

The effectiveness of these methods can be evaluated by:

1. FT-IR spectroscopy to confirm the presence of boron in the framework.
2. 11B MAS NMR spectroscopy to identify and quantify different boron species.
3. Catalytic performance testing in reactions such as propane ODH.

The hydrothermal synthesis method appears to be effective for creating borosilicate zeolites with well-dispersed boron species. However, the relative effectiveness of different incorporation methods may vary depending on the specific catalytic application. For ODH reactions, the ability to create and maintain trigonal boron species (B[3]a and B[3]b) is crucial for high catalytic activity.

Further research is needed to optimize boron incorporation methods for specific catalytic applications and to better understand the relationship between boron coordination environment and catalytic performance.

[5] "One-dimensional 11B MAS NMR were performed to distinguish the B species and identify the active sites. Each spectrum can be deconvoluted into five peaks with chemical shifts at ca.18, 15, 11, 0 and 2.8 ppm.

[6] "We postulate that B[3]a and B[3]b are responsible for the ODH activity. The results agreed well that the defective trigonal structures were the active sites, being consistent with the previous reports that BO3 rather than BO4 species were required for propane ODH to propylene"

The structural characteristics of B-based materials with 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks include:

1. Layered borosilicate zeolites with MWW structure
2. Predominantly microporous structure with some interstitial mesopores
3. Boron incorporated into the zeolite framework
4. Presence of different boron species, including tri-coordinated and tetra-coordinated boron

These features enhance catalytic performance by:

1. Providing a high surface area and well-dispersed active sites
2. Allowing for controlled incorporation of boron into the zeolite structure
3. Creating defective trigonal boron structures (B[3]a and B[3]b) that act as active sites for oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH)

The method used to incorporate B active components into these structures was hydrothermal synthesis, which appears to be effective for creating the desired borosilicate zeolite with dispersed boron species. This method allows for the incorporation of boron into the zeolite framework and the creation of various boron coordination environments.

The effectiveness of this incorporation method for different catalytic applications depends on the specific reaction requirements. For ODH of propane, the creation of defective trigonal boron structures (B[3]a and B[3]b) appears to be particularly beneficial. However, the relative effectiveness for other catalytic applications would require further investigation and comparison with alternative synthesis methods.

The B-based materials with 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks described in this study are layered borosilicate zeolites. These materials enhance catalytic performance through several structural characteristics:

1. Large internal surface areas and micropores of molecular dimensions, providing high accessibility to reactants.

2. High thermal stability, allowing for reactions at elevated temperatures.

3. Incorporation of boron into the zeolite framework, creating active sites for catalysis.

4. Presence of both trigonally and tetrahedrally coordinated boron species, offering different types of active sites.

5. Specific boron species (B[3]a and B[3]b) identified as responsible for oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) activity.

The method used to incorporate B active components into these structures was hydrothermal synthesis, followed by calcination to remove templating agents. This approach appears effective for creating a range of boron species within the zeolite framework, including both trigonal and tetrahedral coordinations.

The effectiveness of this incorporation method for catalytic applications is demonstrated by the material's performance in propane ODH. The catalysts showed good stability and high selectivity towards desired products (propylene and ethylene). The ability to tune the boron content and the resulting distribution of boron species allows for optimization of catalytic performance.

However, the study focuses primarily on ODH reactions. To fully evaluate the effectiveness of this incorporation method for different catalytic applications, further research would be needed on a broader range of reactions. Additionally, comparing this method to other approaches for incorporating boron into porous frameworks would provide a more comprehensive assessment of its relative effectiveness.

The B-based materials with 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks exhibit several structural characteristics that enhance catalytic performance:

1. Large internal surface areas: This provides more accessible active sites for catalysis.

2. Micropores of molecular dimension: These allow for shape selectivity and confinement effects.

3. High thermal stability: This enables the catalysts to withstand high-temperature reactions.

4. Framework incorporation of boron: Boron is incorporated into the zeolite framework, creating well-dispersed active sites throughout the 3-D structure.

5. Multiple boron coordination environments: Both trigonal (B[3]) and tetrahedral (B[4]) boron species are present, with different local structures providing various catalytic functionalities.

The methods used to incorporate B active components into these structures include:

1. Hydrothermal synthesis: Layered borosilicate zeolites are synthesized using this method, which allows for the direct incorporation of boron into the framework during crystal growth.

2. Post-synthesis modification: Although not explicitly mentioned in the text, this is a common method for introducing heteroatoms into zeolite frameworks.

The effectiveness of these methods for different catalytic applications depends on the desired boron species and their distribution:

1. Hydrothermal synthesis is effective for creating a variety of boron environments (B[3] and B[4]) within the zeolite framework. This method is particularly useful for applications requiring well-dispersed boron sites throughout the structure.

2. The presence of defective trigonal boron species (B[3]a and B[3]b) is correlated with higher activity for propane oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH). The hydrothermal synthesis method used in this study successfully created these active sites.

3. The ability to control the boron content and distribution of different boron species (B[3]a, B[3]b, B[3]c, B[4]a, B[4]b) allows for tuning the catalyst for specific applications.

4. The stability of the incorporated boron species under reaction conditions is crucial. In this case, the defective trigonal boron species remained stable and active during the ODH reaction.
