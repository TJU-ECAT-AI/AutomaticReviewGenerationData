The B-based materials with 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks exhibit several structural characteristics that enhance catalytic performance:

1. Large internal surface areas and micropores of molecular dimensions, which provide abundant active sites and facilitate mass transport.

2. High thermal stability, allowing the catalysts to withstand harsh reaction conditions.

3. Incorporation of boron into the zeolite framework, creating various boron species with different coordination environments.

4. Presence of both trigonal and tetrahedral boron species, with at least five major types identified: B[3]a, B[3]b, B[3]c, B[4]a, and B[4]b.

5. Trigonal boron species (B[3]a, B[3]b, B[3]c) are believed to be the active sites for oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) reactions.

These structural features enhance catalytic performance by providing a high concentration of accessible active sites, improving thermal stability, and allowing for tailored reactivity through different boron coordination environments.

The methods used to incorporate B active components into these structures include:

1. Hydrothermal synthesis of layered borosilicate zeolites.
2. Direct incorporation of boron into the zeolite framework during synthesis.

The effectiveness of these methods can be evaluated by:

1. FT-IR spectroscopy to confirm the presence of boron in the framework.
2. 11B MAS NMR spectroscopy to identify and quantify different boron species.
3. Catalytic performance testing in reactions such as propane ODH.

The hydrothermal synthesis method appears to be effective for creating borosilicate zeolites with well-dispersed boron species. However, the relative effectiveness of different incorporation methods may vary depending on the specific catalytic application. For ODH reactions, the ability to create and maintain trigonal boron species (B[3]a and B[3]b) is crucial for high catalytic activity.

Further research is needed to optimize boron incorporation methods for specific catalytic applications and to better understand the relationship between boron coordination environment and catalytic performance.

具有三维分散活性位点的B基多孔框架材料展现出几个增强催化性能的结构特征：

1. 大的内部表面积和分子尺度的微孔，提供了丰富的活性位点并促进了质量传输。

2. 高热稳定性，使催化剂能够承受严苛的反应条件。

3. 将硼掺入沸石框架，创造了具有不同配位环境的各种硼物种。

4. 同时存在三配位和四配位硼物种，至少识别出五种主要类型：B[3]a、B[3]b、B[3]c、B[4]a和B[4]b。

5. 三配位硼物种（B[3]a、B[3]b、B[3]c）被认为是氧化脱氢（ODH）反应的活性位点。

这些结构特征通过提供高浓度的可接近活性位点、提高热稳定性，以及通过不同的硼配位环境允许定制反应性，从而增强了催化性能。

将B活性组分掺入这些结构的方法包括：

1. 水热合成层状硼硅沸石。
2. 在合成过程中将硼直接掺入沸石框架。

这些方法的有效性可以通过以下方式评估：

1. 傅里叶变换红外光谱（FT-IR）确认框架中硼的存在。
2. 11B魔角旋转核磁共振（MAS NMR）光谱鉴定和量化不同的硼物种。
3. 在如丙烷ODH等反应中进行催化性能测试。

水热合成方法似乎对创建具有良好分散硼物种的硼硅沸石有效。然而，不同掺入方法的相对有效性可能因具体的催化应用而异。对于ODH反应，创建和维持三配位硼物种（B[3]a和B[3]b）的能力对于高催化活性至关重要。

需要进一步研究以优化特定催化应用的硼掺入方法，并更好地理解硼配位环境与催化性能之间的关系。
