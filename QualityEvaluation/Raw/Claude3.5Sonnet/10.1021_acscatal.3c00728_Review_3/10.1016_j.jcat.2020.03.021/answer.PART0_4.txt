The B-based materials with 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks exhibit several structural characteristics that enhance catalytic performance:

1. Large internal surface areas: This provides more accessible active sites for catalysis.

2. Micropores of molecular dimension: These allow for shape selectivity and confinement effects.

3. High thermal stability: This enables the catalysts to withstand high-temperature reactions.

4. Framework incorporation of boron: Boron is incorporated into the zeolite framework, creating well-dispersed active sites throughout the 3-D structure.

5. Multiple boron coordination environments: Both trigonal (B[3]) and tetrahedral (B[4]) boron species are present, with different local structures providing various catalytic functionalities.

The methods used to incorporate B active components into these structures include:

1. Hydrothermal synthesis: Layered borosilicate zeolites are synthesized using this method, which allows for the direct incorporation of boron into the framework during crystal growth.

2. Post-synthesis modification: Although not explicitly mentioned in the text, this is a common method for introducing heteroatoms into zeolite frameworks.

The effectiveness of these methods for different catalytic applications depends on the desired boron species and their distribution:

1. Hydrothermal synthesis is effective for creating a variety of boron environments (B[3] and B[4]) within the zeolite framework. This method is particularly useful for applications requiring well-dispersed boron sites throughout the structure.

2. The presence of defective trigonal boron species (B[3]a and B[3]b) is correlated with higher activity for propane oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH). The hydrothermal synthesis method used in this study successfully created these active sites.

3. The ability to control the boron content and distribution of different boron species (B[3]a, B[3]b, B[3]c, B[4]a, B[4]b) allows for tuning the catalyst for specific applications.

4. The stability of the incorporated boron species under reaction conditions is crucial. In this case, the defective trigonal boron species remained stable and active during the ODH reaction.

In conclusion, the hydrothermal synthesis method used in this study effectively created a 3-D dispersed boron-containing zeolite structure with multiple boron environments. This approach proved particularly effective for the ODH of propane, demonstrating the importance of defective trigonal boron species as active sites.

具有三维分散活性位点的B基多孔框架材料展现出几个增强催化性能的结构特征：

1. 大的内部表面积：这提供了更多可接触的催化活性位点。

2. 分子尺度的微孔：这允许形状选择性和限域效应。

3. 高热稳定性：这使催化剂能够承受高温反应。

4. 硼的框架掺入：硼被掺入沸石框架中，在整个三维结构中创造出分散良好的活性位点。

5. 多种硼配位环境：存在三配位(B[3])和四配位(B[4])硼物种，不同的局部结构提供各种催化功能。

将B活性组分掺入这些结构的方法包括：

1. 水热合成：使用此方法合成层状硼硅沸石，允许在晶体生长过程中将硼直接掺入框架。

2. 后合成修饰：虽然文本中没有明确提到，但这是向沸石框架中引入杂原子的常用方法。

这些方法对不同催化应用的有效性取决于所需的硼物种及其分布：

1. 水热合成对于在沸石框架内创造各种硼环境(B[3]和B[4])是有效的。这种方法特别适用于需要在整个结构中分散良好的硼位点的应用。

2. 缺陷型三配位硼物种(B[3]a和B[3]b)的存在与丙烷氧化脱氢(ODH)的更高活性相关。本研究中使用的水热合成方法成功创造了这些活性位点。

3. 控制硼含量和不同硼物种(B[3]a、B[3]b、B[3]c、B[4]a、B[4]b)分布的能力允许针对特定应用调整催化剂。

4. 掺入的硼物种在反应条件下的稳定性至关重要。在这种情况下，缺陷型三配位硼物种在ODH反应过程中保持稳定和活性。

总之，本研究中使用的水热合成方法有效地创造了具有多种硼环境的三维分散硼含沸石结构。这种方法对丙烷的ODH特别有效，证明了缺陷型三配位硼物种作为活性位点的重要性。
