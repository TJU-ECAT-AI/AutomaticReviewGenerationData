[1] "Layered borosilicate zeolites were synthesized."

[2] "The presence of boron in the framework was confirmed by the FT-IR spectra"

[3] "As seen in Fig. 2a, the X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns showed four main diffraction peaks at 2θ = 7.21, 8.02, 10.10 and 26.33, corresponding to the known (1 0 0), (1 0 1), (1 0 2) and (3 1 0) reflections of ERB-1, which confirmed the MWW structure"

[4] "The N2 adsorption-desorption isotherms of different boron-containing MWW-typed zeolites exhibited nearly type-I shape (Fig. 2b), featuring predominantly micropores with a small proportion of interstitial mesopores."

[5] "One-dimensional 11B MAS NMR were performed to distinguish the B species and identify the active sites. Each spectrum can be deconvoluted into five peaks with chemical shifts at ca.18, 15, 11, 0 and 2.8 ppm. The peaks at 18, 15 and 11 ppm were ascribed to tri-coordinated boron which denoted as B[3]a, B[3]b and B[3]c respectively."

[6] "We postulate that B[3]a and B[3]b are responsible for the ODH activity. The results agreed well that the defective trigonal structures were the active sites, being consistent with the previous reports that BO3 rather than BO4 species were required for propane ODH to propylene"

The structural characteristics of B-based materials with 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks include:

1. Layered borosilicate zeolites with MWW structure
2. Predominantly microporous structure with some interstitial mesopores
3. Boron incorporated into the zeolite framework
4. Presence of different boron species, including tri-coordinated and tetra-coordinated boron

These features enhance catalytic performance by:

1. Providing a high surface area and well-dispersed active sites
2. Allowing for controlled incorporation of boron into the zeolite structure
3. Creating defective trigonal boron structures (B[3]a and B[3]b) that act as active sites for oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH)

The method used to incorporate B active components into these structures was hydrothermal synthesis, which appears to be effective for creating the desired borosilicate zeolite with dispersed boron species. This method allows for the incorporation of boron into the zeolite framework and the creation of various boron coordination environments.

The effectiveness of this incorporation method for different catalytic applications depends on the specific reaction requirements. For ODH of propane, the creation of defective trigonal boron structures (B[3]a and B[3]b) appears to be particularly beneficial. However, the relative effectiveness for other catalytic applications would require further investigation and comparison with alternative synthesis methods.

含有三维分散活性位点的B基材料在多孔框架中的结构特征包括：

1. 具有MWW结构的层状硼硅沸石
2. 以微孔为主，含有少量介孔的结构
3. 硼被整合到沸石框架中
4. 存在不同的硼物种，包括三配位和四配位硼

这些特征通过以下方式增强催化性能：

1. 提供高比表面积和分散良好的活性位点
2. 允许将硼以可控方式整合到沸石结构中
3. 创造缺陷型三角硼结构（B[3]a和B[3]b），作为氧化脱氢（ODH）的活性位点

将B活性组分整合到这些结构中的方法是水热合成，这种方法似乎对创造所需的具有分散硼物种的硼硅沸石是有效的。该方法允许将硼整合到沸石框架中，并创造各种硼配位环境。

这种整合方法对不同催化应用的有效性取决于特定反应的要求。对于丙烷的ODH反应，创造缺陷型三角硼结构（B[3]a和B[3]b）似乎特别有益。然而，对于其他催化应用的相对有效性，需要进一步研究和与其他合成方法进行比较。
