Read the questions and answers provided below. First, critically assess the overall relevance of the answers provided to the set of questions asked.

If, upon your assessment, you find that the answers do not contain information that is relevant to the questions asked, stop your review process immediately and respond with a single sentence: "※※※※※※※The provided answers are not relevant to the questions.※※※※※※※". Do not provide any additional explanation or background information, only this sentence should be given as a response in case of irrelevant answers.

If, however, the answers are relevant to the questions asked, proceed to compile answers for each question according to the instructions below. Ensure to aggregate all the relevant answers from the multiple answer results provided in the document, and organize them sequentially by their order number, compiling the corresponding quotes, English answers, and Chinese answers for each question.

If the provided answers' quotes are not differentiated by question, ensure to break them down and assign the quotes to each respective question, outputting them separately within each question's section.

To provide a comprehensive review, differentiate the responses into quotes, English answers, and Chinese answers for each question based on the details given in the 'Answer' XML tags. Structure your review using the XML format showcased below if the answers are relevant to the questions asked:

<EnglishVersionAnswer>

The given literature does not contain information about B-based materials with 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks. The document primarily discusses Ni-promoted CrOx catalysts supported on SBA-15 for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane with CO2 (ODHP). It does not mention boron-based materials or their structural characteristics. Therefore, this question cannot be answered based on the provided literature.

</EnglishVersionAnswer>

<ChineseVersionAnswer>

所给的文献并不包含关于具有三维分散活性位点的多孔框架B基材料的信息。该文档主要讨论了用于丙烷与CO2氧化脱氢(ODHP)的负载在SBA-15上的镍促进的CrOx催化剂。它没有提到硼基材料或其结构特征。因此,无法根据提供的文献回答这个问题。
