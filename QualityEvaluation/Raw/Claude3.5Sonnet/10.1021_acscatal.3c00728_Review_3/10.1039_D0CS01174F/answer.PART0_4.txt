[1] "When using dicyanamide to substitute for urea in the preparation for high surface area boron nitride, its enhanced catalytic performance was maintained in the ODH of propane in view of the 53% propylene selectivity and 18% ethylene selectivity at a 52% propane conversion."

[2] "A three-dimensional ordered macroporous BPO4 material was developed with a robust framework (Fig. 9c), which exhibited excellent activity and selectivity in the ODH of propane with a selectivity of 91.5% for olefins (propylene: 82.5%, ethylene: 9.0%) at a propane conversion of 14.3% at 515 C and a selectivity for the unwanted deep-oxidized CO2 product of less than 1.0%."

[3] "BPO4 was also used as a support in ODH catalytic systems. A B2O3@BPO4 sandwich-like hollow sphere (Fig. 9e) was reported as a liquid-phase catalyst in ODH of propane, and remained stable for 27 h at 550 C with a C3H6 productivity of 0.79 gC3H6 gcat1 h1 and a selectivity of 66.4% for propylene and 18.4% for ethylene at a propane conversion of 24.7%."

[4] "Zeolites are crystalline aluminosilicate materials with three-dimensional network containing channels and cavities of molecular dimensions, and the presence of Al in tetrahedra makes the framework negatively charged."

[5] "Recently, layered borosilicate zeolite (ERB-1, MWW structure) with defective trigonal boron species was reported as a highly active and selective catalyst for the ODH of propane to take advantage of their specific morphology inherent with large internal surface areas, micropore structure and high thermal stability."

B-based materials with 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks exhibit several structural characteristics that enhance catalytic performance:

1. High surface area: Materials like high surface area boron nitride and ordered macroporous boron phosphate provide more exposed active sites, leading to improved catalytic activity.

2. Ordered porous structure: 3-D ordered macroporous structures, as seen in BPO4, allow for better mass transfer and accessibility of reactants to active sites.

3. Microporous structure: Zeolite-based materials with micropores offer shape selectivity and confinement effects that can improve reaction selectivity.

4. Dispersed active sites: The incorporation of boron species throughout the framework, as in borosilicate zeolites, ensures a high density of accessible active sites.

Methods used to incorporate B active components into these structures include:

1. Direct synthesis: Using precursors like dicyanamide instead of urea to create high surface area boron nitride.

2. Template-assisted synthesis: Creating ordered macroporous BPO4 using templating methods.

3. Support-based approaches: Depositing B2O3 on BPO4 to create sandwich-like hollow spheres.

4. Isomorphous substitution: Incorporating boron into zeolite frameworks to create borosilicate zeolites.

The effectiveness of these methods varies depending on the desired application. Direct synthesis and templating methods are effective for creating high surface area materials with ordered porosity, suitable for gas-phase reactions like ODH. Support-based approaches can be useful for creating stable catalysts for liquid-phase reactions. Isomorphous substitution in zeolites is particularly effective for creating materials with well-defined microporous structures and tunable acidity, which can be advantageous for shape-selective catalysis and reactions requiring specific acid-base properties.

Each method has its strengths and limitations, and the choice depends on the specific catalytic application, desired structural features, and the nature of the reaction being catalyzed.

具有三维分散活性位点的多孔框架B基材料展现了几个增强催化性能的结构特征：

1. 高比表面积：像高比表面积的氮化硼和有序大孔磷酸硼这样的材料提供了更多暴露的活性位点，从而提高了催化活性。

2. 有序多孔结构：如BPO4中所见的三维有序大孔结构，允许更好的质量传递和反应物对活性位点的可及性。

3. 微孔结构：具有微孔的沸石基材料提供形状选择性和限域效应，可以提高反应选择性。

4. 分散的活性位点：硼硅沸石中硼物种在整个框架中的分散，确保了高密度的可接触活性位点。

将B活性组分引入这些结构的方法包括：

1. 直接合成：使用二氰胺代替尿素来创造高比表面积的氮化硼。

2. 模板辅助合成：使用模板方法创建有序大孔BPO4。

3. 基于载体的方法：在BPO4上沉积B2O3以创建三明治状空心球。

4. 同晶替代：将硼掺入沸石框架以创建硼硅沸石。

这些方法的有效性因所需应用而异。直接合成和模板法对于创造具有有序孔隙度的高比表面积材料很有效，适用于ODH等气相反应。基于载体的方法可用于创造稳定的液相反应催化剂。沸石中的同晶替代特别有效，可以创造具有明确定义的微孔结构和可调酸度的材料，这对于形状选择性催化和需要特定酸碱性质的反应有利。

每种方法都有其优势和局限性，选择取决于特定的催化应用、所需的结构特征以及被催化反应的性质。
