[1] "Boron oxide embedded in zeolites Zeolites are crystalline aluminosilicate materials with three-dimensional network containing channels and cavities of molecular dimensions, and the presence of Al in tetrahedra makes the framework negatively charged."

[2] "Recently, layered borosilicate zeolite (ERB-1, MWW structure) with defective trigonal boron species was reported as a highly active and selective catalyst for the ODH of propane to take advantage of their specific morphology inherent with large internal surface areas, micropore structure and high thermal stability."

[3] "In these synthesized zeolites, the boron species were classified into five types according to solid-state 11B MAS NMR, i.e. framework trigonal B(OSi)xOH3x(x=1,2), B(OSi)3, tetrahedral B(OH)2(OSi)2, B(OSi)4 and aggregated terminal BOH species"

[4] "Isomorphous substitution of tri- or tetravalent metal atoms (Al, Ti, Fe and V) by borosilicate zeolites is a good route in the production of some new zeolites that need expensive organic structure directing agents (OSDAs), long crystallization time or co-presence of dopant."

[5] "Furthermore, taking advantage of the high propensity of boron to hydrolyze, its presence benefits the fabrication of mesoporous zeolite, and may increase the mesopore volume by 46%."

B-based materials with 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks, such as boron-embedded zeolites, offer several structural advantages that enhance catalytic performance:

1. Three-dimensional network structure: Zeolites provide a crystalline aluminosilicate framework with channels and cavities of molecular dimensions, allowing for high surface area and controlled access to active sites.

2. Diverse boron species: Multiple types of boron species can be incorporated, including framework trigonal and tetrahedral boron, as well as terminal BOH groups. This diversity of active sites can contribute to improved catalytic activity and selectivity.

3. Mesopore generation: The inclusion of boron can facilitate the creation of mesopores, increasing pore volume and improving mass transfer properties.

4. Thermal stability: The zeolite framework provides high thermal stability, which is crucial for maintaining catalyst performance under harsh reaction conditions.

Methods for incorporating B active components into these structures include:

1. Isomorphous substitution: Replacing Al, Ti, Fe, or V atoms in the zeolite framework with boron. This method is effective for creating new zeolite structures without requiring expensive organic structure-directing agents or long crystallization times.

2. Direct synthesis: Incorporating boron during the initial zeolite synthesis process, which can result in a more uniform distribution of boron species throughout the framework.

3. Post-synthesis modification: Treating pre-formed zeolites with boron-containing compounds to introduce boron species, which can be effective for creating defect sites or surface-bound boron species.

The effectiveness of these methods varies depending on the desired catalytic application. Isomorphous substitution is particularly useful for creating new zeolite structures with well-defined boron sites. Direct synthesis can provide a more homogeneous distribution of boron, which may be beneficial for reactions requiring a high density of active sites. Post-synthesis modification offers flexibility in tailoring the boron species and their location within the zeolite structure, which can be advantageous for fine-tuning catalyst selectivity.

Overall, the incorporation of boron into 3-D porous frameworks like zeolites offers a versatile approach to creating highly active and selective catalysts for various applications, including oxidative dehydrogenation reactions.

具有三维分散活性位点的B基多孔框架材料，如嵌入硼的沸石，具有几个可以提高催化性能的结构优势：

1. 三维网络结构：沸石提供了具有分子尺寸通道和孔穴的结晶铝硅酸盐框架，允许高比表面积和对活性位点的可控访问。

2. 多样的硼物种：可以incorporate多种类型的硼物种，包括框架三配位和四配位硼，以及端基BOH基团。这种活性位点的多样性可以贡献于改善催化活性和选择性。

3. 介孔生成：硼的存在可以促进介孔的产生，增加孔体积并改善物质传递性能。

4. 热稳定性：沸石框架提供了高热稳定性，这对于在苛刻反应条件下维持催化剂性能至关重要。

将B活性组分incorporate入这些结构的方法包括：

1. 同构替换：用硼替换沸石框架中的Al、Ti、Fe或V原子。这种方法对于创建新的沸石结构很有效，无需昂贵的有机结构导向剂或长时间结晶。

2. 直接合成：在初始沸石合成过程中incorporate硼，这可以导致硼物种在整个框架中更均匀的分布。

3. 后合成修饰：用含硼化合物处理预先形成的沸石，以引入硼物种，这对于创建缺陷位点或表面结合的硼物种很有效。

这些方法的有效性因所需的催化应用而异。同构替换特别适用于创建具有明确定义的硼位点的新沸石结构。直接合成可以提供更均匀的硼分布，这可能对需要高密度活性位点的反应有利。后合成修饰在调整沸石结构中的硼物种及其位置方面提供了灵活性，这对于微调催化剂选择性可能有优势。

总的来说，将硼incorporate入像沸石这样的三维多孔框架中，为创建高活性和高选择性的催化剂提供了一种多功能方法，适用于各种应用，包括氧化脱氢反应。
