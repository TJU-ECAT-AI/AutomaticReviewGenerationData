[1] "Lu and coworkers synthesized mesoporous silica-supported boron oxide catalysts (B2O3/SBA-15) and identified four B species by using the 11B NMR technique"

[2] "Layered borosilicate zeolite (ERB-1, MWW structure) with defective trigonal boron species was reported as a highly active and selective catalyst for the ODH of propane to take advantage of their specific morphology inherent with large internal surface areas, micropore structure and high thermal stability."

[3] "In order to improve the exposure of active sites and the mass transfer, a three-dimensional ordered macroporous BPO4 material was developed with a robust framework, which exhibited excellent activity and selectivity in the ODH of propane"

[4] "A B2O3@BPO4 sandwich-like hollow sphere was reported as a liquid-phase catalyst in ODH of propane, and remained stable for 27 h at 550 C with a C3H6 productivity of 0.79 gC3H6 gcat1 h1"

B-based materials with 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks exhibit several structural characteristics that enhance catalytic performance:

1. High surface area: Mesoporous silica supports like SBA-15 and layered zeolites provide large internal surface areas, increasing the number of accessible active sites.

2. Microporous structure: Zeolites offer a microporous framework that can improve mass transfer and provide shape selectivity.

3. Ordered macroporous structure: 3D ordered macroporous materials like BPO4 improve mass transfer and accessibility of active sites.

4. Hollow spheres: Structures like B2O3@BPO4 sandwich-like hollow spheres provide high surface area and improved stability.

Methods used to incorporate B active components into these structures include:

1. Impregnation: Used for preparing B2O3/SBA-15 catalysts.
2. Direct synthesis: Layered borosilicate zeolites are synthesized with B incorporated into the framework.
3. Template-assisted synthesis: Used to create ordered macroporous BPO4 materials.
4. Core-shell synthesis: Employed to create B2O3@BPO4 sandwich-like hollow spheres.

The effectiveness of these methods varies depending on the application:

- Impregnation is simple but may result in non-uniform distribution of active sites.
- Direct synthesis of borosilicate zeolites allows for precise control of B content and distribution but may be more complex.
- Template-assisted synthesis can create highly ordered structures but may require additional steps for template removal.
- Core-shell synthesis can create unique structures with enhanced stability but may be more challenging to scale up.

Each method has its advantages and limitations, and the choice depends on the desired catalytic properties and application requirements.

具有三维分散活性位点的多孔框架B基材料展现了几个增强催化性能的结构特征：

1. 高比表面积：如SBA-15的介孔硅支撑材料和层状沸石提供了大的内部表面积，增加了可接触的活性位点数量。

2. 微孔结构：沸石提供了微孔框架，可以改善物质传递并提供形状选择性。

3. 有序大孔结构：如BPO4的三维有序大孔材料改善了物质传递和活性位点的可接触性。

4. 空心球：如B2O3@BPO4三明治状空心球结构提供了高比表面积和改善的稳定性。

将B活性组分引入这些结构的方法包括：

1. 浸渍法：用于制备B2O3/SBA-15催化剂。
2. 直接合成：层状硼硅沸石的合成过程中将B直接引入框架。
3. 模板辅助合成：用于创建有序大孔BPO4材料。
4. 核壳合成：用于创建B2O3@BPO4三明治状空心球。

这些方法的有效性因应用而异：

- 浸渍法简单但可能导致活性位点分布不均匀。
- 硼硅沸石的直接合成允许精确控制B含量和分布，但可能更复杂。
- 模板辅助合成可以创建高度有序的结构，但可能需要额外的步骤来去除模板。
- 核壳合成可以创建具有增强稳定性的独特结构，但可能更难放大规模。

每种方法都有其优点和局限性，选择取决于所需的催化性能和应用要求。
