[1] "Boron oxide embedded in zeolites Zeolites are crystalline aluminosilicate materials with three-dimensional network containing channels and cavities of molecular dimensions, and the presence of Al in tetrahedra makes the framework negatively charged."

[2] "Recently, layered borosilicate zeolite (ERB-1, MWW structure) with defective trigonal boron species was reported as a highly active and selective catalyst for the ODH of propane to take advantage of their specific morphology inherent with large internal surface areas, micropore structure and high thermal stability."

[3] "In these synthesized zeolites, the boron species were classified into five types according to solid-state 11B MAS NMR, i.e. framework trigonal B(OSi)xOH3x(x=1,2), B(OSi)3, tetrahedral B(OH)2(OSi)2, B(OSi)4 and aggregated terminal BOH species"

[4] "Isomorphous substitution of tri- or tetravalent metal atoms (Al, Ti, Fe and V) by borosilicate zeolites is a good route in the production of some new zeolites that need expensive organic structure directing agents (OSDAs), long crystallization time or co-presence of dopant."

[5] "Furthermore, taking advantage of the high propensity of boron to hydrolyze, its presence benefits the fabrication of mesoporous zeolite, and may increase the mesopore volume by 46%."

B-based materials with 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks, such as boron-embedded zeolites, offer several structural advantages that enhance catalytic performance:

1. Three-dimensional network structure: Zeolites provide a crystalline aluminosilicate framework with channels and cavities of molecular dimensions, allowing for high surface area and controlled access to active sites.

2. Diverse boron species: Multiple types of boron species can be incorporated, including framework trigonal and tetrahedral boron, as well as terminal BOH groups. This diversity of active sites can contribute to improved catalytic activity and selectivity.

3. Mesopore generation: The inclusion of boron can facilitate the creation of mesopores, increasing pore volume and improving mass transfer properties.

4. Thermal stability: The zeolite framework provides high thermal stability, which is crucial for maintaining catalyst performance under harsh reaction conditions.

Methods for incorporating B active components into these structures include:

1. Isomorphous substitution: Replacing Al, Ti, Fe, or V atoms in the zeolite framework with boron. This method is effective for creating new zeolite structures without requiring expensive organic structure-directing agents or long crystallization times.

2. Direct synthesis: Incorporating boron during the initial zeolite synthesis process, which can result in a more uniform distribution of boron species throughout the framework.

3. Post-synthesis modification: Treating pre-formed zeolites with boron-containing compounds to introduce boron species, which can be effective for creating defect sites or surface-bound boron species.

The effectiveness of these methods varies depending on the desired catalytic application. Isomorphous substitution is particularly useful for creating new zeolite structures with well-defined boron sites. Direct synthesis can provide a more homogeneous distribution of boron, which may be beneficial for reactions requiring a high density of active sites. Post-synthesis modification offers flexibility in tailoring the boron species and their location within the zeolite structure, which can be advantageous for fine-tuning catalyst selectivity.

Overall, the incorporation of boron into 3-D porous frameworks like zeolites offers a versatile approach to creating highly active and selective catalysts for various applications, including oxidative dehydrogenation reactions.
