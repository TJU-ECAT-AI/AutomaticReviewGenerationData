[1] "The endeavors aiming at rational design and improvement of boron-based catalytic systems have been devoted to increasing the surface area and the exposure of oxygenated boron active sites. For h-BN, the edge-hydroxylation of BN, synthesis of BN with boric acid and dicyanamide, and assembly of 2D BN nanosheets into 3D ordered architectures were reported as effective ways to enhance the catalytic activity of BN."

[2] "By means of similar strategies, functionalized silicon boride, supported B2O3 on high surface area SBA-15, and ordered macroporous boron phosphate were also reported with remarkable performance in the ODH of light alkanes."

[3] "A three-dimensional ordered macroporous BPO4 material was developed200 with a robust framework (Fig. 9c), which exhibited excellent activity and selectivity in the ODH of propane with a selectivity of 91.5% for olefins (propylene: 82.5%, ethylene: 9.0%) at a propane conversion of 14.3% at 515 C and a selectivity for the unwanted deep-oxidized CO2 product of less than 1.0%."

[4] "A B2O3@BPO4 sandwich-like hollow sphere (Fig. 9e) was reported as a liquid-phase catalyst in ODH of propane,48 and remained stable for 27 h at 550 C with a C3H6 productivity of 0.79 gC3H6 gcat1 h1 and a selectivity of 66.4% for propylene and 18.4% for ethylene at a propane conversion of 24.7%."

B-based materials with 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks offer enhanced catalytic performance due to their increased surface area and exposure of oxygenated boron active sites. These structural characteristics allow for better accessibility of reactants to the active sites and improved mass transfer.

Several methods have been used to incorporate B active components into these structures:

1. Edge-hydroxylation of BN: This technique increases the number of active BOH sites on the edges of BN sheets.

2. Synthesis of BN with boric acid and dicyanamide: This approach allows for the creation of BN materials with higher surface areas and more exposed active sites.

3. Assembly of 2D BN nanosheets into 3D ordered architectures: This method creates hierarchical structures with improved mass transfer properties and increased accessibility to active sites.

4. Functionalization of silicon boride: This technique modifies the surface of silicon boride to create more active boron sites.

5. Supporting B2O3 on high surface area materials like SBA-15: This method disperses boron oxide on a high surface area support, increasing the number of accessible active sites.

6. Development of ordered macroporous boron phosphate: This approach creates a robust 3D framework with high surface area and well-dispersed active sites.

These methods have shown varying degrees of effectiveness for different catalytic applications. For example, the ordered macroporous BPO4 material exhibited excellent activity and selectivity in the ODH of propane, while the B2O3@BPO4 sandwich-like hollow sphere showed good stability and selectivity in liquid-phase ODH of propane.

The effectiveness of these methods depends on the specific catalytic application, as different reactions may require different structural properties and active site distributions. However, all these approaches aim to maximize the exposure of active boron sites and improve mass transfer, which are crucial factors in enhancing catalytic performance.

具有三维分散活性位点的多孔框架B基材料由于其增加的表面积和暴露的含氧硼活性位点而表现出增强的催化性能。这些结构特征允许反应物更好地接触活性位点，并改善了传质效果。

几种方法被用来将B活性组分引入这些结构中：

1. BN的边缘羟基化：这种技术增加了BN片边缘上活性BOH位点的数量。

2. 用硼酸和二氰胺合成BN：这种方法允许创建具有更高表面积和更多暴露活性位点的BN材料。

3. 将2D BN纳米片组装成3D有序结构：这种方法创建了具有改善的传质性能和增加的活性位点可及性的分层结构。

4. 硅化硼的功能化：这种技术修饰硅化硼的表面以创建更多活性硼位点。

5. 将B2O3负载在高比表面积材料如SBA-15上：这种方法将氧化硼分散在高比表面积载体上，增加了可接触的活性位点数量。

6. 开发有序大孔硼酸盐：这种方法创建了具有高表面积和良好分散活性位点的稳固3D框架。

这些方法对不同催化应用的有效性各不相同。例如，有序大孔BPO4材料在丙烷ODH反应中表现出优异的活性和选择性，而B2O3@BPO4三明治状空心球在液相丙烷ODH反应中表现出良好的稳定性和选择性。

这些方法的有效性取决于特定的催化应用，因为不同的反应可能需要不同的结构特性和活性位点分布。然而，所有这些方法都旨在最大化暴露活性硼位点并改善传质效果，这些都是提高催化性能的关键因素。
