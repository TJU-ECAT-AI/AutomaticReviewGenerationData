[1] "The preparation of a boron nitride wash-coated monolithic catalyst49 offered an applicable way to improve, besides the olefin selectivity, the heat and mass transfer which is vital for industrialization owing to the intrinsic feature of high exothermicity of the ODH reaction that could produce hotspots and thus subsequent negative consequences in the olefin selectivity and safety issues."

[2] "In order to improve the exposure of active sites and the mass transfer, a three-dimensional ordered macroporous BPO4 material was developed200 with a robust framework (Fig. 9c), which exhibited excellent activity and selectivity in the ODH of propane with a selectivity of 91.5% for olefins (propylene: 82.5%, ethylene: 9.0%) at a propane conversion of 14.3% at 515 C and a selectivity for the unwanted deep-oxidized CO2 product of less than 1.0%."

[3] "By means of similar strategies, functionalized silicon boride, supported B2O3 on high surface area SBA-15, and ordered macroporous boron phosphate were also reported with remarkable performance in the ODH of light alkanes."

[4] "For h-BN, the edge-hydroxylation of BN, synthesis of BN with boric acid and dicyanamide, and assembly of 2D BN nanosheets into 3D ordered architectures were reported as effective ways to enhance the catalytic activity of BN."

B-based materials with 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks exhibit enhanced catalytic performance due to several structural characteristics:

1. Improved heat and mass transfer: The 3-D porous structure allows for better distribution of heat and facilitates the movement of reactants and products throughout the catalyst.

2. Increased surface area: The porous framework exposes more active sites, leading to higher catalytic activity.

3. Enhanced stability: The robust 3-D structure provides better resistance to sintering and deactivation under reaction conditions.

4. Better selectivity: The controlled environment within the pores can influence product selectivity by limiting unwanted side reactions.

Methods used to incorporate B active components into these structures include:

1. Wash-coating: Applied to create monolithic catalysts, improving olefin selectivity and heat/mass transfer.

2. Ordered macroporous synthesis: Used to develop 3-D ordered macroporous BPO4 materials with excellent activity and selectivity.

3. Support-based methods: B2O3 supported on high surface area materials like SBA-15.

4. Edge-functionalization: Hydroxylation of BN edges to increase active sites.

5. Precursor-based synthesis: Using boric acid and dicyanamide to synthesize BN with desired properties.

6. Assembly techniques: Creating 3-D ordered architectures from 2D BN nanosheets.

The effectiveness of these methods varies depending on the specific catalytic application. Wash-coating and ordered macroporous synthesis appear particularly effective for ODH reactions, offering improved selectivity and stability. Support-based methods are versatile and allow for high dispersion of active sites. Edge-functionalization and precursor-based synthesis are effective for tailoring the properties of BN-based catalysts. Assembly techniques show promise in creating hierarchical structures with enhanced performance.

Overall, the choice of method depends on the desired catalyst properties, reaction conditions, and scalability requirements for the specific catalytic application.
