[1] "Here, we present both hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) and boron nitride nanotubes (BNNTs) as metal-free materials able to catalyze the ODHP reaction."

[2] "BNNTs exhibit a rate of propane consumption (mol C3H8 kg-cat1 s1) more than one order of magnitude as high as that observed with h-BN (fig. S4). The higher activity of BNNTs at least partially reflects the higher surface area of BNNTs relative to h-BN (BNNT, 97  5 m2 g1 versus h-BN, 16  1 m2 g1)"

[3] "From the combination of catalytic activity, spectroscopic data, and DFT calculations and in line with the observed oxygen-dependence of the kinetics, we therefore propose that an oxygen molecule bonded to one B and one N [an oxygen-terminated armchair edge of BN (>BOON<)] acts as active site for the ODHP reaction."

[4] "We consider that the observed high olefin selectivity may largely be due to the stabilization of the propyl radical by the nitroxyl radical site. Indeed, the one-dimensional (1D) nature of this edge avoids the creation of a highly reactive propyl radical (typical of 0D single-site catalysts) (34), and also the overoxidation of the adsorbed species (typical of 2D surface catalysts) is suppressed (35)."

The literature primarily focuses on hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) and boron nitride nanotubes (BNNTs) as catalysts for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP), rather than B-based materials with 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks. However, we can analyze some relevant aspects of these materials' structural characteristics and their impact on catalytic performance.

The study shows that BNNTs exhibit higher catalytic activity compared to h-BN, which is partially attributed to their higher surface area. This suggests that increasing the accessible surface area of B-based materials can enhance catalytic performance by providing more active sites for the reaction.

The proposed active site for the ODHP reaction is an oxygen-terminated armchair edge of BN (>BOON<). This one-dimensional edge structure is crucial for the high olefin selectivity observed. The 1D nature of the edge helps stabilize the propyl radical intermediate, avoiding the creation of highly reactive species that could lead to overoxidation. This is in contrast to 0D single-site catalysts or 2D surface catalysts, which are more prone to overoxidation.

While the study doesn't directly discuss methods for incorporating B active components into 3-D porous frameworks, the insights gained from h-BN and BNNTs suggest that creating structures with high surface area and controlled edge sites could be beneficial for catalytic applications. Potential strategies could involve synthesizing 3-D porous BN materials or incorporating BN structures into existing porous frameworks to maximize the number of accessible edge sites.

The effectiveness of these approaches for different catalytic applications would likely depend on the specific reaction requirements. For ODHP, the ability to create and control the density of oxygen-terminated armchair edge sites would be crucial. For other reactions, different types of active sites or structural features might be more important.

In summary, while the study doesn't directly address 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks, it provides valuable insights into how structural characteristics of B-based materials can enhance catalytic performance, particularly through surface area optimization and control of edge site structures.

该文献主要集中在六方氮化硼（h-BN）和氮化硼纳米管（BNNTs）作为丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）的催化剂，而不是具有3-D分散活性位点的多孔框架B基材料。然而，我们可以分析这些材料的一些相关结构特征及其对催化性能的影响。

研究表明，与h-BN相比，BNNTs表现出更高的催化活性，这部分归因于它们更高的比表面积。这表明增加B基材料的可接触表面积可以通过提供更多的反应活性位点来提高催化性能。

ODHP反应的proposed活性位点是氮化硼的含氧扶手椅边缘（>BOON<）。这种一维边缘结构对观察到的高烯烃选择性至关重要。边缘的一维性质有助于稳定丙基自由基中间体，避免产生高反应活性的物种，从而导致过度氧化。这与更容易发生过度氧化的0D单点催化剂或2D表面催化剂形成对比。

虽然该研究没有直接讨论将B活性组分引入3-D多孔框架的方法，但从h-BN和BNNTs获得的见解表明，创建具有高比表面积和可控边缘位点的结构可能有利于催化应用。潜在的策略可能包括合成3-D多孔BN材料或将BN结构引入现有的多孔框架，以最大化可接触边缘位点的数量。

这些方法对不同催化应用的有效性可能取决于特定反应的要求。对于ODHP，创建和控制含氧扶手椅边缘位点的密度将是至关重要的。对于其他反应，不同类型的活性位点或结构特征可能更为重要。

总之，虽然该研究没有直接涉及多孔框架中的3-D分散活性位点，但它为B基材料的结构特征如何增强催化性能提供了宝贵的见解，特别是通过表面积优化和边缘位点结构的控制。
