[1] "Here, we present both hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) and boron nitride nanotubes (BNNTs) as metal-free materials able to catalyze the ODHP reaction."

[2] "BNNTs exhibit a rate of propane consumption (mol C3H8 kg-cat1 s1) more than one order of magnitude as high as that observed with h-BN (fig. S4). The higher activity of BNNTs at least partially reflects the higher surface area of BNNTs relative to h-BN (BNNT, 97  5 m2 g1 versus h-BN, 16  1 m2 g1)"

[3] "From the combination of catalytic activity, spectroscopic data, and DFT calculations and in line with the observed oxygen-dependence of the kinetics, we therefore propose that an oxygen molecule bonded to one B and one N [an oxygen-terminated armchair edge of BN (>BOON<)] acts as active site for the ODHP reaction."

[4] "We consider that the observed high olefin selectivity may largely be due to the stabilization of the propyl radical by the nitroxyl radical site. Indeed, the one-dimensional (1D) nature of this edge avoids the creation of a highly reactive propyl radical (typical of 0D single-site catalysts) (34), and also the overoxidation of the adsorbed species (typical of 2D surface catalysts) is suppressed (35)."

The literature primarily focuses on hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) and boron nitride nanotubes (BNNTs) as catalysts for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP), rather than discussing B-based materials with 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks. However, we can analyze some structural characteristics and their impact on catalytic performance based on the information provided.

The structural characteristics of h-BN and BNNTs enhance catalytic performance in several ways:

1. Higher surface area: BNNTs have a significantly higher surface area compared to h-BN, which contributes to their increased catalytic activity. This larger surface area provides more accessible active sites for the reaction to occur.

2. One-dimensional edge sites: The active sites are proposed to be oxygen-terminated armchair edges of BN (>BOON<). The 1D nature of these edge sites plays a crucial role in enhancing selectivity by stabilizing reaction intermediates and preventing overoxidation.

3. Metal-free composition: Both h-BN and BNNTs are metal-free materials, which offers advantages in terms of stability and selectivity compared to traditional metal-based catalysts.

The method used to incorporate B active components into these structures is not explicitly discussed in the given literature. However, the study focuses on the inherent properties of h-BN and BNNTs rather than on methods of incorporating additional B active components.

The effectiveness of these B-based materials for ODHP is demonstrated by their high selectivity towards propene and ethene, as well as their stability under reaction conditions. The unique structural characteristics of these materials, particularly the 1D edge sites, contribute to their superior performance compared to traditional catalysts.

While the literature does not discuss the effectiveness of these materials for other catalytic applications, the insights gained from this study could potentially be applied to develop B-based catalysts for other selective oxidation reactions.

这篇文献主要关注六方氮化硼（h-BN）和氮化硼纳米管（BNNTs）作为丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）的催化剂，而不是讨论具有3D分散活性位点的多孔框架B基材料。然而，我们可以根据所提供的信息分析一些结构特征及其对催化性能的影响。

h-BN和BNNTs的结构特征通过以下几种方式增强了催化性能：

1. 更高的比表面积：与h-BN相比，BNNTs具有显著更高的比表面积，这有助于提高其催化活性。较大的表面积为反应提供了更多可接触的活性位点。

2. 一维边缘位点：活性位点被认为是氧化物端接的BN扶手边缘（>BOON<）。这些边缘位点的一维性质在增强选择性方面起着关键作用，通过稳定反应中间体和防止过度氧化。

3. 无金属成分：h-BN和BNNTs都是无金属材料，与传统的金属基催化剂相比，在稳定性和选择性方面具有优势。

该文献中并未明确讨论将B活性组分引入这些结构的方法。然而，该研究侧重于h-BN和BNNTs的固有特性，而不是引入额外B活性组分的方法。

这些B基材料对ODHP的有效性通过其对丙烯和乙烯的高选择性以及在反应条件下的稳定性得到了证明。这些材料的独特结构特征，特别是一维边缘位点，使其性能优于传统催化剂。

虽然文献没有讨论这些材料对其他催化应用的有效性，但从这项研究中获得的见解可能有助于开发用于其他选择性氧化反应的B基催化剂。
