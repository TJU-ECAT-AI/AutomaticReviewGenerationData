[1] "Here, we present both hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) and boron nitride nanotubes (BNNTs) as metal-free materials able to catalyze the ODHP reaction."

[2] "BNNTs exhibit a rate of propane consumption (mol C3H8 kg-cat1 s1) more than one order of magnitude as high as that observed with h-BN (fig. S4). The higher activity of BNNTs at least partially reflects the higher surface area of BNNTs relative to h-BN (BNNT, 97  5 m2 g1 versus h-BN, 16  1 m2 g1)"

[3] "From the combination of catalytic activity, spectroscopic data, and DFT calculations and in line with the observed oxygen-dependence of the kinetics, we therefore propose that an oxygen molecule bonded to one B and one N [an oxygen-terminated armchair edge of BN (>BOON<)] acts as active site for the ODHP reaction."

[4] "We consider that the observed high olefin selectivity may largely be due to the stabilization of the propyl radical by the nitroxyl radical site. Indeed, the one-dimensional (1D) nature of this edge avoids the creation of a highly reactive propyl radical (typical of 0D single-site catalysts) (34), and also the overoxidation of the adsorbed species (typical of 2D surface catalysts) is suppressed (35)."

The literature does not provide a comprehensive analysis of B-based materials with 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks. Instead, it focuses on hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) and boron nitride nanotubes (BNNTs) as catalysts for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reaction.

The structural characteristics discussed are primarily related to the 1D nature of the active sites on the edges of these materials, rather than 3-D dispersed sites in porous frameworks. The study proposes that oxygen-terminated armchair edges of BN (>BOON<) act as the active sites for the ODHP reaction.

The enhanced catalytic performance is attributed to several factors:

1. The 1D nature of the edge sites, which avoids the creation of highly reactive propyl radicals and suppresses overoxidation of adsorbed species.

2. Higher surface area of BNNTs compared to h-BN, leading to increased catalytic activity.

3. The stabilization of propyl radicals by nitroxyl radical sites on the BN edges.

The methods used to incorporate B active components are not explicitly discussed in the given literature. Instead, the study focuses on the inherent properties of h-BN and BNNTs as catalysts.

While this research provides valuable insights into the catalytic properties of BN materials, it does not address 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks or compare different methods of incorporating B active components for various catalytic applications. To fully answer the question, additional research on B-based materials with 3-D porous structures would be necessary.

该文献并未对具有3-D分散活性位点的多孔框架中的B基材料进行全面分析。相反，它主要关注六方氮化硼（h-BN）和氮化硼纳米管（BNNTs）作为丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）反应的催化剂。

讨论的结构特征主要与这些材料边缘上的1D性质的活性位点有关，而不是多孔框架中的3-D分散位点。研究提出，氮化硼的氧化末端扶手边缘（>BOON<）作为ODHP反应的活性位点。

增强的催化性能归因于以下几个因素：

1. 边缘位点的1D性质，避免了高度活性丙基自由基的产生，并抑制了吸附物种的过度氧化。

2. BNNTs比h-BN具有更高的表面积，导致催化活性增加。

3. BN边缘上的亚硝基自由基位点对丙基自由基的稳定作用。

文献中没有明确讨论引入B活性组分的方法。相反，研究重点关注h-BN和BNNTs作为催化剂的固有特性。

虽然这项研究为BN材料的催化特性提供了有价值的见解，但它并未涉及多孔框架中的3-D分散活性位点，也没有比较将B活性组分引入不同催化应用的各种方法。要全面回答这个问题，还需要对具有3-D多孔结构的B基材料进行额外的研究。

The literature does not directly address 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks for B-based materials. However, it does discuss the structural characteristics and catalytic performance of hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) and boron nitride nanotubes (BNNTs) for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reaction.

The study shows that BNNTs exhibit higher catalytic activity than h-BN, which is partially attributed to their higher surface area. This suggests that increasing the surface area of B-based materials can enhance catalytic performance.

The research proposes that the high olefin selectivity observed is due to the one-dimensional nature of the oxygen-terminated armchair edge sites in these materials. These 1D sites are thought to stabilize propyl radicals and suppress overoxidation, leading to improved catalytic performance compared to 0D single-site catalysts or 2D surface catalysts.

The study does not discuss methods for incorporating B active components into porous frameworks. Instead, it focuses on the inherent properties of h-BN and BNNTs as catalysts. The incorporation of boron in these materials is a result of their natural structure rather than a specific synthesis method.

While this research provides valuable insights into the catalytic properties of B-based materials, it does not directly address 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks or methods for incorporating B active components into such structures. Further research would be needed to explore these aspects and their potential impact on catalytic applications beyond the ODHP reaction studied here.

该文献并未直接讨论多孔框架中具有三维分散活性位点的B基材料。然而，它确实讨论了六方氮化硼(h-BN)和氮化硼纳米管(BNNTs)在丙烷氧化脱氢(ODHP)反应中的结构特征和催化性能。

研究表明，BNNTs表现出比h-BN更高的催化活性，这部分归因于其更高的表面积。这表明增加B基材料的表面积可以提高催化性能。

研究提出，观察到的高烯烃选择性是由于这些材料中含氧扶手椅边缘位点的一维性质。这些一维位点被认为可以稳定丙基自由基并抑制过度氧化，从而导致与零维单一位点催化剂或二维表面催化剂相比，催化性能得到改善。

该研究没有讨论将B活性组分纳入多孔框架的方法。相反，它侧重于h-BN和BNNTs作为催化剂的固有特性。这些材料中硼的掺入是其天然结构的结果，而不是特定的合成方法。

虽然这项研究为B基材料的催化性质提供了有价值的见解，但它并没有直接涉及多孔框架中的三维分散活性位点或将B活性组分纳入此类结构的方法。需要进一步的研究来探索这些方面及其对本研究中ODHP反应以外的催化应用的潜在影响。

The literature does not directly discuss B-based materials with 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks. Instead, it focuses on hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) and boron nitride nanotubes (BNNTs) as catalysts for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP).

The structural characteristics mentioned are primarily 2-D (h-BN) and 1-D (BNNTs) in nature, rather than 3-D porous frameworks. The active sites are proposed to be oxygen-terminated armchair edges of BN (>BOON<), which are one-dimensional in nature.

The enhanced catalytic performance is attributed to several factors:

1. The 1-D nature of the active sites, which stabilizes intermediates and prevents overoxidation.
2. Higher surface area of BNNTs compared to h-BN, leading to increased activity.
3. The unique oxygen activation at BN edge vacancies.

The method of incorporating B active components is not explicitly discussed in the literature. Instead, the study focuses on the use of existing BN materials (h-BN and BNNTs) and their behavior under reaction conditions.

Given the limited information provided in the literature about 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks, a critical evaluation of methods to incorporate B active components into these structures is not possible based on this text alone.

文献中并未明确讨论引入B活性组分的方法。相反，研究重点关注现有BN材料（h-BN和BNNTs）及其在反应条件下的行为。

鉴于文献中关于3-D分散活性位点在多孔框架中的信息有限，仅基于此文本无法对将B活性组分引入这些结构的方法进行批评性评估。

The literature primarily focuses on hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) and boron nitride nanotubes (BNNTs) as catalysts for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP), rather than discussing B-based materials with 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks. However, we can analyze some structural characteristics and their impact on catalytic performance based on the information provided.

The structural characteristics of h-BN and BNNTs enhance catalytic performance in several ways:

1. Higher surface area: BNNTs have a significantly higher surface area compared to h-BN, which contributes to their increased catalytic activity. This larger surface area provides more accessible active sites for the reaction to occur.

2. One-dimensional edge sites: The active sites are proposed to be oxygen-terminated armchair edges of BN (>BOON<). The 1D nature of these edge sites plays a crucial role in enhancing selectivity by stabilizing reaction intermediates and preventing overoxidation.

3. Metal-free composition: Both h-BN and BNNTs are metal-free materials, which offers advantages in terms of stability and selectivity compared to traditional metal-based catalysts.

The method used to incorporate B active components into these structures is not explicitly discussed in the given literature. However, the study focuses on the inherent properties of h-BN and BNNTs rather than on methods of incorporating additional B active components.

The effectiveness of these B-based materials for ODHP is demonstrated by their high selectivity towards propene and ethene, as well as their stability under reaction conditions. The unique structural characteristics of these materials, particularly the 1D edge sites, contribute to their superior performance compared to traditional catalysts.

While the literature does not discuss the effectiveness of these materials for other catalytic applications, the insights gained from this study could potentially be applied to develop B-based catalysts for other selective oxidation reactions.

这篇文献主要关注六方氮化硼（h-BN）和氮化硼纳米管（BNNTs）作为丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）的催化剂，而不是讨论具有3D分散活性位点的多孔框架B基材料。然而，我们可以根据所提供的信息分析一些结构特征及其对催化性能的影响。

h-BN和BNNTs的结构特征通过以下几种方式增强了催化性能：

1. 更高的比表面积：与h-BN相比，BNNTs具有显著更高的比表面积，这有助于提高其催化活性。较大的表面积为反应提供了更多可接触的活性位点。

2. 一维边缘位点：活性位点被认为是氧化物端接的BN扶手边缘（>BOON<）。这些边缘位点的一维性质在增强选择性方面起着关键作用，通过稳定反应中间体和防止过度氧化。

3. 无金属成分：h-BN和BNNTs都是无金属材料，与传统的金属基催化剂相比，在稳定性和选择性方面具有优势。

该文献中并未明确讨论将B活性组分引入这些结构的方法。然而，该研究侧重于h-BN和BNNTs的固有特性，而不是引入额外B活性组分的方法。

这些B基材料对ODHP的有效性通过其对丙烯和乙烯的高选择性以及在反应条件下的稳定性得到了证明。这些材料的独特结构特征，特别是一维边缘位点，使其性能优于传统催化剂。

虽然文献没有讨论这些材料对其他催化应用的有效性，但从这项研究中获得的见解可能有助于开发用于其他选择性氧化反应的B基催化剂。

The literature primarily focuses on hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) and boron nitride nanotubes (BNNTs) as catalysts for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP), rather than B-based materials with 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks. However, we can analyze some relevant aspects of these materials' structural characteristics and their impact on catalytic performance.

The study shows that BNNTs exhibit higher catalytic activity compared to h-BN, which is partially attributed to their higher surface area. This suggests that increasing the accessible surface area of B-based materials can enhance catalytic performance by providing more active sites for the reaction.

The proposed active site for the ODHP reaction is an oxygen-terminated armchair edge of BN (>BOON<). This one-dimensional edge structure is crucial for the high olefin selectivity observed. The 1D nature of the edge helps stabilize the propyl radical intermediate, avoiding the creation of highly reactive species that could lead to overoxidation. This is in contrast to 0D single-site catalysts or 2D surface catalysts, which are more prone to overoxidation.

While the study doesn't directly discuss methods for incorporating B active components into 3-D porous frameworks, the insights gained from h-BN and BNNTs suggest that creating structures with high surface area and controlled edge sites could be beneficial for catalytic applications. Potential strategies could involve synthesizing 3-D porous BN materials or incorporating BN structures into existing porous frameworks to maximize the number of accessible edge sites.

The effectiveness of these approaches for different catalytic applications would likely depend on the specific reaction requirements. For ODHP, the ability to create and control the density of oxygen-terminated armchair edge sites would be crucial. For other reactions, different types of active sites or structural features might be more important.

In summary, while the study doesn't directly address 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks, it provides valuable insights into how structural characteristics of B-based materials can enhance catalytic performance, particularly through surface area optimization and control of edge site structures.

该文献主要集中在六方氮化硼（h-BN）和氮化硼纳米管（BNNTs）作为丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）的催化剂，而不是具有3-D分散活性位点的多孔框架B基材料。然而，我们可以分析这些材料的一些相关结构特征及其对催化性能的影响。

研究表明，与h-BN相比，BNNTs表现出更高的催化活性，这部分归因于它们更高的比表面积。这表明增加B基材料的可接触表面积可以通过提供更多的反应活性位点来提高催化性能。

ODHP反应的proposed活性位点是氮化硼的含氧扶手椅边缘（>BOON<）。这种一维边缘结构对观察到的高烯烃选择性至关重要。边缘的一维性质有助于稳定丙基自由基中间体，避免产生高反应活性的物种，从而导致过度氧化。这与更容易发生过度氧化的0D单点催化剂或2D表面催化剂形成对比。

虽然该研究没有直接讨论将B活性组分引入3-D多孔框架的方法，但从h-BN和BNNTs获得的见解表明，创建具有高比表面积和可控边缘位点的结构可能有利于催化应用。潜在的策略可能包括合成3-D多孔BN材料或将BN结构引入现有的多孔框架，以最大化可接触边缘位点的数量。

这些方法对不同催化应用的有效性可能取决于特定反应的要求。对于ODHP，创建和控制含氧扶手椅边缘位点的密度将是至关重要的。对于其他反应，不同类型的活性位点或结构特征可能更为重要。

总之，虽然该研究没有直接涉及多孔框架中的3-D分散活性位点，但它为B基材料的结构特征如何增强催化性能提供了宝贵的见解，特别是通过表面积优化和边缘位点结构的控制。
