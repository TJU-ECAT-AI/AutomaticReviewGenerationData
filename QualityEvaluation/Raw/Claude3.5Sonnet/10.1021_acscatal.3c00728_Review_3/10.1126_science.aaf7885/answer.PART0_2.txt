[1] "Here, we present both hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) and boron nitride nanotubes (BNNTs) as metal-free materials able to catalyze the ODHP reaction."

[2] "BNNTs exhibit a rate of propane consumption (mol C3H8 kg-cat1 s1) more than one order of magnitude as high as that observed with h-BN (fig. S4). The higher activity of BNNTs at least partially reflects the higher surface area of BNNTs relative to h-BN (BNNT, 97  5 m2 g1 versus h-BN, 16  1 m2 g1)"

[3] "We therefore propose that an oxygen molecule bonded to one B and one N [an oxygen-terminated armchair edge of BN (>BOON<)] acts as active site for the ODHP reaction."

[4] "We consider that the observed high olefin selectivity may largely be due to the stabilization of the propyl radical by the nitroxyl radical site. Indeed, the one-dimensional (1D) nature of this edge avoids the creation of a highly reactive propyl radical (typical of 0D single-site catalysts) (34), and also the overoxidation of the adsorbed species (typical of 2D surface catalysts) is suppressed (35)."

The literature does not directly discuss B-based materials with 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks. Instead, it focuses on hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) and boron nitride nanotubes (BNNTs) as catalysts for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP).

The structural characteristics mentioned are primarily 2-D (h-BN) and 1-D (BNNTs) in nature, rather than 3-D porous frameworks. The active sites are proposed to be oxygen-terminated armchair edges of BN (>BOON<), which are one-dimensional in nature.

The enhanced catalytic performance is attributed to several factors:

1. The 1-D nature of the active sites, which stabilizes intermediates and prevents overoxidation.
2. Higher surface area of BNNTs compared to h-BN, leading to increased activity.
3. The unique oxygen activation at BN edge vacancies.

The method of incorporating B active components is not explicitly discussed in the literature. Instead, the study focuses on the use of existing BN materials (h-BN and BNNTs) and their behavior under reaction conditions.

Given the limited information provided in the literature about 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks, a critical evaluation of methods to incorporate B active components into these structures is not possible based on this text alone.

该文献并未直接讨论具有3-D分散活性位点的多孔框架中的B基材料。相反，它主要关注六方氮化硼（h-BN）和氮化硼纳米管（BNNTs）作为丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）的催化剂。

提到的结构特征主要是2-D（h-BN）和1-D（BNNTs）性质，而不是3-D多孔框架。活性位点被认为是氧化端基的BN扶手边缘（>BOON<），这是一维的。

增强的催化性能归因于几个因素：

1. 活性位点的一维性质，可以稳定中间体并防止过度氧化。
2. BNNTs比h-BN具有更高的比表面积，导致活性增加。
3. BN边缘空位处独特的氧气活化。

文献中并未明确讨论引入B活性组分的方法。相反，研究重点关注现有BN材料（h-BN和BNNTs）及其在反应条件下的行为。

鉴于文献中关于3-D分散活性位点在多孔框架中的信息有限，仅基于此文本无法对将B活性组分引入这些结构的方法进行批评性评估。
