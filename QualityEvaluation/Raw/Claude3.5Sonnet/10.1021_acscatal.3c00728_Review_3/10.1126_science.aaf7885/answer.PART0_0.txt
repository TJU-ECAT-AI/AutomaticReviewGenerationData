[1] "Here, we present both hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) and boron nitride nanotubes (BNNTs) as metal-free materials able to catalyze the ODHP reaction."

[2] "BNNTs exhibit a rate of propane consumption (mol C3H8 kg-cat1 s1) more than one order of magnitude as high as that observed with h-BN (fig. S4). The higher activity of BNNTs at least partially reflects the higher surface area of BNNTs relative to h-BN (BNNT, 97  5 m2 g1 versus h-BN, 16  1 m2 g1)"

[3] "From the combination of catalytic activity, spectroscopic data, and DFT calculations and in line with the observed oxygen-dependence of the kinetics, we therefore propose that an oxygen molecule bonded to one B and one N [an oxygen-terminated armchair edge of BN (>BOON<)] acts as active site for the ODHP reaction."

[4] "We consider that the observed high olefin selectivity may largely be due to the stabilization of the propyl radical by the nitroxyl radical site. Indeed, the one-dimensional (1D) nature of this edge avoids the creation of a highly reactive propyl radical (typical of 0D single-site catalysts) (34), and also the overoxidation of the adsorbed species (typical of 2D surface catalysts) is suppressed (35)."

The literature does not provide a comprehensive analysis of B-based materials with 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks. Instead, it focuses on hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) and boron nitride nanotubes (BNNTs) as catalysts for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reaction.

The structural characteristics discussed are primarily related to the 1D nature of the active sites on the edges of these materials, rather than 3-D dispersed sites in porous frameworks. The study proposes that oxygen-terminated armchair edges of BN (>BOON<) act as the active sites for the ODHP reaction.

The enhanced catalytic performance is attributed to several factors:

1. The 1D nature of the edge sites, which avoids the creation of highly reactive propyl radicals and suppresses overoxidation of adsorbed species.

2. Higher surface area of BNNTs compared to h-BN, leading to increased catalytic activity.

3. The stabilization of propyl radicals by nitroxyl radical sites on the BN edges.

The methods used to incorporate B active components are not explicitly discussed in the given literature. Instead, the study focuses on the inherent properties of h-BN and BNNTs as catalysts.

While this research provides valuable insights into the catalytic properties of BN materials, it does not address 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks or compare different methods of incorporating B active components for various catalytic applications. To fully answer the question, additional research on B-based materials with 3-D porous structures would be necessary.

该文献并未对具有3-D分散活性位点的多孔框架中的B基材料进行全面分析。相反，它主要关注六方氮化硼（h-BN）和氮化硼纳米管（BNNTs）作为丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）反应的催化剂。

讨论的结构特征主要与这些材料边缘上的1D性质的活性位点有关，而不是多孔框架中的3-D分散位点。研究提出，氮化硼的氧化末端扶手边缘（>BOON<）作为ODHP反应的活性位点。

增强的催化性能归因于以下几个因素：

1. 边缘位点的1D性质，避免了高度活性丙基自由基的产生，并抑制了吸附物种的过度氧化。

2. BNNTs比h-BN具有更高的表面积，导致催化活性增加。

3. BN边缘上的亚硝基自由基位点对丙基自由基的稳定作用。

文献中没有明确讨论引入B活性组分的方法。相反，研究重点关注h-BN和BNNTs作为催化剂的固有特性。

虽然这项研究为BN材料的催化特性提供了有价值的见解，但它并未涉及多孔框架中的3-D分散活性位点，也没有比较将B活性组分引入不同催化应用的各种方法。要全面回答这个问题，还需要对具有3-D多孔结构的B基材料进行额外的研究。
