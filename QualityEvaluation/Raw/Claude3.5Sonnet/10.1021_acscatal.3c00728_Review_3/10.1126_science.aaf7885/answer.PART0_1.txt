[1] "Here, we present both hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) and boron nitride nanotubes (BNNTs) as metal-free materials able to catalyze the ODHP reaction."

[2] "BNNTs exhibit a rate of propane consumption (mol C3H8 kg-cat1 s1) more than one order of magnitude as high as that observed with h-BN (fig. S4). The higher activity of BNNTs at least partially reflects the higher surface area of BNNTs relative to h-BN (BNNT, 97  5 m2 g1 versus h-BN, 16  1 m2 g1)"

[3] "We consider that the observed high olefin selectivity may largely be due to the stabilization of the propyl radical by the nitroxyl radical site. Indeed, the one-dimensional (1D) nature of this edge avoids the creation of a highly reactive propyl radical (typical of 0D single-site catalysts) (34), and also the overoxidation of the adsorbed species (typical of 2D surface catalysts) is suppressed (35)."

The literature does not directly address 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks for B-based materials. However, it does discuss the structural characteristics and catalytic performance of hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) and boron nitride nanotubes (BNNTs) for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reaction.

The study shows that BNNTs exhibit higher catalytic activity than h-BN, which is partially attributed to their higher surface area. This suggests that increasing the surface area of B-based materials can enhance catalytic performance.

The research proposes that the high olefin selectivity observed is due to the one-dimensional nature of the oxygen-terminated armchair edge sites in these materials. These 1D sites are thought to stabilize propyl radicals and suppress overoxidation, leading to improved catalytic performance compared to 0D single-site catalysts or 2D surface catalysts.

The study does not discuss methods for incorporating B active components into porous frameworks. Instead, it focuses on the inherent properties of h-BN and BNNTs as catalysts. The incorporation of boron in these materials is a result of their natural structure rather than a specific synthesis method.

While this research provides valuable insights into the catalytic properties of B-based materials, it does not directly address 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks or methods for incorporating B active components into such structures. Further research would be needed to explore these aspects and their potential impact on catalytic applications beyond the ODHP reaction studied here.

该文献并未直接讨论多孔框架中具有三维分散活性位点的B基材料。然而，它确实讨论了六方氮化硼(h-BN)和氮化硼纳米管(BNNTs)在丙烷氧化脱氢(ODHP)反应中的结构特征和催化性能。

研究表明，BNNTs表现出比h-BN更高的催化活性，这部分归因于其更高的表面积。这表明增加B基材料的表面积可以提高催化性能。

研究提出，观察到的高烯烃选择性是由于这些材料中含氧扶手椅边缘位点的一维性质。这些一维位点被认为可以稳定丙基自由基并抑制过度氧化，从而导致与零维单一位点催化剂或二维表面催化剂相比，催化性能得到改善。

该研究没有讨论将B活性组分纳入多孔框架的方法。相反，它侧重于h-BN和BNNTs作为催化剂的固有特性。这些材料中硼的掺入是其天然结构的结果，而不是特定的合成方法。

虽然这项研究为B基材料的催化性质提供了有价值的见解，但它并没有直接涉及多孔框架中的三维分散活性位点或将B活性组分纳入此类结构的方法。需要进一步的研究来探索这些方面及其对本研究中ODHP反应以外的催化应用的潜在影响。
