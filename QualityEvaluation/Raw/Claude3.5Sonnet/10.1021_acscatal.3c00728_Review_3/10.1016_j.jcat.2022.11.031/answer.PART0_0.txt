[1] "Compared with crystalline zeolite with microporous structure and saturated coordination framework atoms, embryonic zeolitic materials have the feature of extra-large microporosity with several unit cell dimensions of size."

[2] "The greatly exposed small unit cells allow guest molecules easy to diffuse and the extra-large micropores improve the efficiency of mass transfer and accessibility of the active sites."

[3] "More importantly, after embedding boron atoms, the defect-rich zeolitic structures offer abundant SiOH and BOH groups, which contributed to the stabilization of boron species and construction of active boron centers with proton transfer with adjacent SiOH through hydrogen bonds."

The structural characteristics of B-based materials with 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks include extra-large microporosity, defect-rich zeolitic structures, and open coordination boron sites. These features enhance catalytic performance by improving diffusion of guest molecules, increasing mass transfer efficiency, and providing better accessibility to active sites. The abundance of SiOH and BOH groups in the defect-rich structure contributes to the stabilization of boron species and the formation of active boron centers through hydrogen bonding.

The method used to incorporate B active components into these structures involves the synthesis of embryonic borosilicate zeolite (EBZ) using tetrapropylammonium hydroxide (TPAOH) as an organic structure-directing agent. This approach is effective in creating a defect-rich structure with highly exposed active boron centers, which leads to improved olefin and propylene selectivity compared to conventional MFI-type borosilicate zeolites.

The effectiveness of this method for different catalytic applications is demonstrated by the superior performance of EBZ catalysts in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reaction. The open coordination of boron sites derived from the defect-rich structure ensures ample exposure of the active centers, contributing to enhanced catalytic activity. However, the literature does not provide information on the effectiveness of this method for other catalytic applications beyond ODHP, limiting a comprehensive evaluation of its broader applicability.

具有三维分散活性位点的B基材料在多孔框架中的结构特征包括超大微孔、缺陷丰富的沸石结构和开放配位的硼位点。这些特征通过改善客体分子的扩散、提高质量传递效率和提供更好的活性位点可及性来增强催化性能。缺陷丰富结构中大量的SiOH和BOH基团有助于硼物种的稳定和通过氢键形成活性硼中心。

将B活性组分引入这些结构的方法涉及使用四丙基氢氧化铵(TPAOH)作为有机结构导向剂合成胚胎型硼硅沸石(EBZ)。这种方法能有效地创造具有高度暴露的活性硼中心的缺陷丰富结构，从而导致与传统MFI型硼硅沸石相比，烯烃和丙烯选择性得到改善。

这种方法对不同催化应用的有效性通过EBZ催化剂在丙烷氧化脱氢(ODHP)反应中的卓越性能得到证明。源自缺陷丰富结构的硼位点的开放配位确保了活性中心的充分暴露，有助于增强催化活性。然而，文献没有提供关于这种方法在ODHP之外的其他催化应用中的有效性信息，限制了对其更广泛适用性的全面评估。
