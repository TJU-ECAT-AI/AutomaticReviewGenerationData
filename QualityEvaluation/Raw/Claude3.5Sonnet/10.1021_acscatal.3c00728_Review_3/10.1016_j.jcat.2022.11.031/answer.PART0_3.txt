[1] "Boron-containing zeolites have been proven potential in catalyzing the oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) process and the boron sites in open coordination are considered as the active center."

B-based materials with 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks exhibit several structural characteristics that enhance catalytic performance:

1. Open coordination of boron sites: This feature allows for greater exposure of the active centers, increasing their accessibility to reactants.

2. Defect-rich structure: The presence of abundant SiOH and BOH groups contributes to the stabilization of boron species and the construction of active boron centers through hydrogen bonding with adjacent SiOH groups.

3. Large microporous spaces: These provide free environments for gas-phase reactions, which are crucial for high performance in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reactions.

4. H-bonded BOH groups in defect tri-coordination boron species: These are responsible for activating propane on both the catalyst surface and in the gas phase.

The incorporation of B active components into these structures is primarily achieved through the synthesis of embryonic borosilicate zeolites. This method involves using tetrapropylammonium hydroxide (TPAOH) as an organic structure-directing agent and varying the B2O3:SiO2 ratio in the synthesis gel. This approach results in an amorphous, defect-rich zeolitic structure with well-dispersed boron sites.

The effectiveness of this method for catalytic applications, particularly in ODHP reactions, is demonstrated by the improved olefin and propylene selectivity compared to conventional MFI-type borosilicate zeolites. The embryonic borosilicate zeolite catalysts show enhanced propylene productivity and selectivity due to the increased contribution of gas-phase reactions facilitated by their unique structural features.

However, it's important to note that this study focuses primarily on ODHP reactions. The effectiveness of this incorporation method for other catalytic applications would require further investigation and may vary depending on the specific reaction requirements and conditions.

具有3-D分散活性位点的多孔框架B基材料展现出几个增强催化性能的结构特征：

1. 硼位点的开放配位：这一特征允许活性中心更大程度的暴露，增加了它们对反应物的可及性。

2. 缺陷丰富的结构：大量SiOH和BOH基团的存在有助于硼物种的稳定和通过与相邻SiOH基团氢键形成活性硼中心的构建。

3. 大微孔空间：这为气相反应提供了自由环境，对于丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）反应的高性能至关重要。

4. 缺陷三配位硼物种中的H键BOH基团：这些基团负责在催化剂表面和气相中活化丙烷。

将B活性组分incorporation到这些结构中主要是通过合成胚胎型硼硅沸石来实现的。这种方法涉及使用四丙基氢氧化铵（TPAOH）作为有机结构导向剂，并在合成凝胶中改变B2O3:SiO2比例。这种方法产生了一种无定形、缺陷丰富的沸石结构，其中硼位点分散良好。

这种方法对催化应用，特别是ODHP反应的有效性，通过与传统MFI型硼硅沸石相比改善的烯烃和丙烯选择性得到了证明。由于其独特的结构特征促进了气相反应的贡献增加，胚胎型硼硅沸石催化剂显示出增强的丙烯生产率和选择性。

然而，需要注意的是，这项研究主要集中在ODHP反应上。这种incorporation方法对其他催化应用的有效性需要进一步研究，并且可能因特定反应要求和条件而异。
