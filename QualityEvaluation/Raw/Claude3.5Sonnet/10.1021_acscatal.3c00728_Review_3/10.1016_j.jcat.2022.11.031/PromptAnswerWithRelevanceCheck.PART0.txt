The structural characteristics of B-based materials with 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks include extra-large microporosity, defect-rich zeolitic structures, and open coordination boron sites. These features enhance catalytic performance by improving diffusion of guest molecules, increasing mass transfer efficiency, and providing better accessibility to active sites. The abundance of SiOH and BOH groups in the defect-rich structure contributes to the stabilization of boron species and the formation of active boron centers through hydrogen bonding.

The method used to incorporate B active components into these structures involves the synthesis of embryonic borosilicate zeolite (EBZ) using tetrapropylammonium hydroxide (TPAOH) as an organic structure-directing agent. This approach is effective in creating a defect-rich structure with highly exposed active boron centers, which leads to improved olefin and propylene selectivity compared to conventional MFI-type borosilicate zeolites.

The effectiveness of this method for different catalytic applications is demonstrated by the superior performance of EBZ catalysts in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reaction. The open coordination of boron sites derived from the defect-rich structure ensures ample exposure of the active centers, contributing to enhanced catalytic activity. However, the literature does not provide information on the effectiveness of this method for other catalytic applications beyond ODHP, limiting a comprehensive evaluation of its broader applicability.

具有三维分散活性位点的B基材料在多孔框架中的结构特征包括超大微孔、缺陷丰富的沸石结构和开放配位的硼位点。这些特征通过改善客体分子的扩散、提高质量传递效率和提供更好的活性位点可及性来增强催化性能。缺陷丰富结构中大量的SiOH和BOH基团有助于硼物种的稳定和通过氢键形成活性硼中心。

将B活性组分引入这些结构的方法涉及使用四丙基氢氧化铵(TPAOH)作为有机结构导向剂合成胚胎型硼硅沸石(EBZ)。这种方法能有效地创造具有高度暴露的活性硼中心的缺陷丰富结构，从而导致与传统MFI型硼硅沸石相比，烯烃和丙烯选择性得到改善。

这种方法对不同催化应用的有效性通过EBZ催化剂在丙烷氧化脱氢(ODHP)反应中的卓越性能得到证明。源自缺陷丰富结构的硼位点的开放配位确保了活性中心的充分暴露，有助于增强催化活性。然而，文献没有提供关于这种方法在ODHP之外的其他催化应用中的有效性信息，限制了对其更广泛适用性的全面评估。

B-based materials with 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks exhibit several structural characteristics that enhance catalytic performance:

1. Open coordination of boron sites: This configuration allows for better exposure of the active centers, increasing their accessibility to reactants.

2. Defect-rich structure: The presence of defects in the zeolitic framework creates more open coordination sites for boron, further enhancing the exposure of active centers.

3. Extra-large microporosity: Compared to crystalline zeolites, embryonic zeolitic materials feature larger pores, which improve mass transfer and accessibility of active sites.

4. Silanol-rich structure: This feature helps disperse boron species and prevents their detachment from the catalytic system.

5. Abundant SiOH and BOH groups: These groups contribute to the stabilization of boron species and the formation of active boron centers through hydrogen bonding.

These structural characteristics collectively enhance catalytic performance by increasing the number and accessibility of active sites, improving mass transfer, and stabilizing the boron species within the framework.

The methods used to incorporate B active components into these structures include:

1. Direct synthesis: Boron is incorporated during the initial synthesis of the zeolitic material, as demonstrated in the preparation of embryonic borosilicate zeolite catalysts.

2. Post-synthesis modification: This method involves treating pre-synthesized zeolites with boron-containing compounds to introduce boron into the framework.

The effectiveness of these methods can vary depending on the specific catalytic application. Direct synthesis appears to be more effective for creating a uniform distribution of boron throughout the structure and forming the desired open coordination sites. This method is particularly useful for applications requiring a high density of well-dispersed active sites, such as oxidative dehydrogenation of propane.

Post-synthesis modification may be more suitable for fine-tuning the boron content or for introducing boron into pre-existing zeolite structures. However, this method may result in a less uniform distribution of boron and potentially lower stability of the active sites.

In conclusion, the choice of incorporation method should be based on the specific requirements of the catalytic application, considering factors such as desired boron distribution, stability of active sites, and the nature of the zeolitic framework.

具有三维分散活性位点的多孔框架B基材料展现出几个增强催化性能的结构特征：

1. 硼位点的开放配位：这种构型允许活性中心更好地暴露，增加了它们与反应物的可及性。

2. 缺陷丰富的结构：沸石框架中存在的缺陷为硼创造了更多的开放配位位点，进一步增强了活性中心的暴露。

3. 超大微孔：与晶态沸石相比，胚胎沸石材料具有更大的孔隙，这改善了质量传递和活性位点的可及性。

4. 硅羟基丰富的结构：这一特征有助于分散硼物种并防止它们从催化系统中脱离。

5. 丰富的SiOH和BOH基团：这些基团通过氢键作用促进了硼物种的稳定和活性硼中心的形成。

这些结构特征共同通过增加活性位点的数量和可及性、改善质量传递以及稳定框架内的硼物种来增强催化性能。

将B活性组分引入这些结构的方法包括：

1. 直接合成：在沸石材料的初始合成过程中引入硼，如在制备胚胎硼硅沸石催化剂中所示。

2. 后合成修饰：这种方法涉及用含硼化合物处理预先合成的沸石，以将硼引入框架。

这些方法的有效性可能因特定的催化应用而异。直接合成似乎更有效地在整个结构中创建均匀分布的硼，并形成所需的开放配位位点。这种方法特别适用于需要高密度well分散活性位点的应用，如丙烷的氧化脱氢。

后合成修饰可能更适合微调硼含量或将硼引入预先存在的沸石结构中。然而，这种方法可能导致硼分布不太均匀，并可能降低活性位点的稳定性。

总之，incorporation方法的选择应基于催化应用的具体要求，考虑诸如所需的硼分布、活性位点的稳定性以及沸石框架的性质等因素。

4. H-bonded BOH groups in defect tri-coordination boron species: These are responsible for activating propane on both the catalyst surface and in the gas phase.

The incorporation of B active components into these structures is primarily achieved through the synthesis of embryonic borosilicate zeolites. This method involves using tetrapropylammonium hydroxide (TPAOH) as an organic structure-directing agent and varying the B2O3:SiO2 ratio in the synthesis gel. This approach results in an amorphous, defect-rich zeolitic structure with well-dispersed boron sites.

The effectiveness of this method for catalytic applications, particularly in ODHP reactions, is demonstrated by the improved olefin and propylene selectivity compared to conventional MFI-type borosilicate zeolites. The embryonic borosilicate zeolite catalysts show enhanced propylene productivity and selectivity due to the increased contribution of gas-phase reactions facilitated by their unique structural features.

However, it's important to note that this study focuses primarily on ODHP reactions. The effectiveness of this incorporation method for other catalytic applications would require further investigation and may vary depending on the specific reaction requirements and conditions.

2. Efficient propane activation: Aggregated boron species embedded in zeolite structures show high efficiency in activating propane molecules.

3. Durability and synergistic conversion: Isolated boron sites with specific structures (e.g., B[OHO(H)Si]2) in borosilicate zeolites demonstrate long-term durability and enable synergistic conversion of oxygen and propane through hydrogen bonding.

4. Enhanced diffusion and accessibility: Embryonic zeolitic materials with extra-large microporosity allow for easier diffusion of guest molecules and improved mass transfer, increasing the accessibility of active sites.

5. Stabilization of active sites: Defect-rich zeolitic structures with abundant SiOH and BOH groups contribute to the stabilization of boron species and the construction of active boron centers through hydrogen bonding.

Methods used to incorporate B active components into these structures include:

1. Direct synthesis: Incorporating boron sources during the zeolite synthesis process, allowing for the creation of boron-containing frameworks.

2. Post-synthesis modification: Introducing boron species into pre-formed zeolite structures through techniques such as ion exchange or impregnation.

3. Embryonic zeolite synthesis: Preparing amorphous or partially crystalline zeolitic materials with high defect concentrations, which can then be used to incorporate boron species.

The effectiveness of these methods varies depending on the specific catalytic application:

1. Direct synthesis is effective for creating well-dispersed boron sites within the zeolite framework but may limit the flexibility in controlling boron content and distribution.

2. Post-synthesis modification allows for more precise control over boron content and can be used to target specific locations within the zeolite structure, but may result in less uniform distribution of boron species.

3. Embryonic zeolite synthesis is particularly effective for creating highly accessible boron sites with enhanced stability, making it suitable for reactions requiring high catalytic activity and selectivity, such as oxidative dehydrogenation of propane.

Each method has its advantages and limitations, and the choice depends on the desired catalytic properties and the specific reaction requirements. Further research is needed to optimize these methods for different catalytic applications and to develop new techniques for incorporating boron active components into porous frameworks.
