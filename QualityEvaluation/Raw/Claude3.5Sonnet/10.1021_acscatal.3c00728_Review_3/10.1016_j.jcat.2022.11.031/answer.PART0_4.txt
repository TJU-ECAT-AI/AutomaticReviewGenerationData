[1] "Boron-based catalysts have received significant attention for their inhibition of deep oxidation of olefins in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) process for the production of propylene"

[2] "The aggregated boron species embedded in MWW- and MFI-typed zeolite displayed high efficiency in activating propane"

[3] "Lately, the isolated boron site with B[OHO(H)Si]2 structure in borosilicate zeolite showed durability in long period test and enabled the synergistic conversion of oxygen and propane through three hydrogen bonds on the boron site"

[4] "Compared with crystalline zeolite with microporous structure and saturated coordination framework atoms, embryonic zeolitic materials have the feature of extra-large microporosity with several unit cell dimensions of size. The greatly exposed small unit cells allow guest molecules easy to diffuse and the extra-large micropores improve the efficiency of mass transfer and accessibility of the active sites."

[5] "More importantly, after embedding boron atoms, the defect-rich zeolitic structures offer abundant SiOH and BOH groups, which contributed to the stabilization of boron species and construction of active boron centers with proton transfer with adjacent SiOH through hydrogen bonds."

B-based materials with 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks exhibit several key structural characteristics that enhance catalytic performance:

1. Inhibition of deep oxidation: Boron-based catalysts can inhibit the deep oxidation of olefins in oxidative dehydrogenation processes, improving selectivity towards desired products.

2. Efficient propane activation: Aggregated boron species embedded in zeolite structures show high efficiency in activating propane molecules.

3. Durability and synergistic conversion: Isolated boron sites with specific structures (e.g., B[OHO(H)Si]2) in borosilicate zeolites demonstrate long-term durability and enable synergistic conversion of oxygen and propane through hydrogen bonding.

4. Enhanced diffusion and accessibility: Embryonic zeolitic materials with extra-large microporosity allow for easier diffusion of guest molecules and improved mass transfer, increasing the accessibility of active sites.

5. Stabilization of active sites: Defect-rich zeolitic structures with abundant SiOH and BOH groups contribute to the stabilization of boron species and the construction of active boron centers through hydrogen bonding.

Methods used to incorporate B active components into these structures include:

1. Direct synthesis: Incorporating boron sources during the zeolite synthesis process, allowing for the creation of boron-containing frameworks.

2. Post-synthesis modification: Introducing boron species into pre-formed zeolite structures through techniques such as ion exchange or impregnation.

3. Embryonic zeolite synthesis: Preparing amorphous or partially crystalline zeolitic materials with high defect concentrations, which can then be used to incorporate boron species.

The effectiveness of these methods varies depending on the specific catalytic application:

1. Direct synthesis is effective for creating well-dispersed boron sites within the zeolite framework but may limit the flexibility in controlling boron content and distribution.

2. Post-synthesis modification allows for more precise control over boron content and can be used to target specific locations within the zeolite structure, but may result in less uniform distribution of boron species.

3. Embryonic zeolite synthesis is particularly effective for creating highly accessible boron sites with enhanced stability, making it suitable for reactions requiring high catalytic activity and selectivity, such as oxidative dehydrogenation of propane.

Each method has its advantages and limitations, and the choice depends on the desired catalytic properties and the specific reaction requirements. Further research is needed to optimize these methods for different catalytic applications and to develop new techniques for incorporating boron active components into porous frameworks.

具有3-D分散活性位点的B基材料在多孔框架中展现出几个关键的结构特征，这些特征能够增强催化性能：

1. 抑制深度氧化：硼基催化剂能够抑制氧化脱氢过程中烯烃的深度氧化，提高目标产物的选择性。

2. 高效活化丙烷：嵌入沸石结构中的聚集硼物种在活化丙烷分子方面表现出高效性。

3. 耐久性和协同转化：硼硅酸盐沸石中具有特定结构（如B[OHO(H)Si]2）的孤立硼位点表现出长期耐久性，并通过氢键实现氧气和丙烷的协同转化。

4. 增强扩散和可及性：具有超大微孔的胚胎沸石材料允许客体分子更容易扩散，改善了质量传递，增加了活性位点的可及性。

5. 稳定活性位点：具有丰富SiOH和BOH基团的缺陷丰富的沸石结构有助于稳定硼物种，并通过氢键构建活性硼中心。

将B活性组分引入这些结构的方法包括：

1. 直接合成：在沸石合成过程中引入硼源，允许创建含硼框架。

2. 后合成修饰：通过离子交换或浸渍等技术将硼物种引入预先形成的沸石结构中。

3. 胚胎沸石合成：制备具有高缺陷浓度的无定形或部分结晶的沸石材料，然后用于引入硼物种。

这些方法的有效性因特定的催化应用而异：

1. 直接合成对于在沸石框架内创建分散良好的硼位点很有效，但可能限制对硼含量和分布的控制灵活性。

2. 后合成修饰允许更精确地控制硼含量，并可用于靶向沸石结构中的特定位置，但可能导致硼物种分布不均匀。

3. 胚胎沸石合成特别有效，可创建高度可及的硼位点，具有增强的稳定性，使其适用于需要高催化活性和选择性的反应，如丙烷的氧化脱氢。

每种方法都有其优点和局限性，选择取决于所需的催化性能和特定的反应要求。需要进一步研究以优化这些方法用于不同的催化应用，并开发将硼活性组分引入多孔框架的新技术。
