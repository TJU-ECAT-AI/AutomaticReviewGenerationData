[1] "Compared with crystalline zeolite with microporous structure and saturated coordination framework atoms, embryonic zeolitic materials have the feature of extra-large microporosity with several unit cell dimensions of size."

[2] "The greatly exposed small unit cells allow guest molecules easy to diffuse and the extra-large micropores improve the efficiency of mass transfer and accessibility of the active sites."

[3] "More importantly, after embedding boron atoms, the defect-rich zeolitic structures offer abundant SiOH and BOH groups, which contributed to the stabilization of boron species and construction of active boron centers with proton transfer with adjacent SiOH through hydrogen bonds."

[4] "The amorphous embryonic borosilicate zeolite catalysts were synthesized using tetrapropylammonium hydroxide (TPAOH) as organic structure-directing agents (OSDA) from clear homogeneous sols with a molar composition of SiO2: B2O3: TPAOH: H2O: EtOH = 1: x: 0.14: 21: 4 (x = 0.084, 0.168, 0.252 and 0.336)."

The structural characteristics of B-based materials with 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks include:

1. Extra-large microporosity with several unit cell dimensions of size, compared to crystalline zeolites.
2. Greatly exposed small unit cells that allow easy diffusion of guest molecules.
3. Improved efficiency of mass transfer and accessibility of active sites due to extra-large micropores.
4. Defect-rich zeolitic structures offering abundant SiOH and BOH groups after embedding boron atoms.
5. Stabilization of boron species and construction of active boron centers through hydrogen bonds between BOH and adjacent SiOH groups.

These features enhance catalytic performance by:

1. Facilitating the diffusion of reactants and products through the porous structure.
2. Increasing the accessibility of active sites.
3. Improving mass transfer efficiency.
4. Stabilizing the boron species, which act as active sites.
5. Creating active boron centers through hydrogen bonding.

The method used to incorporate B active components into these structures involves synthesizing amorphous embryonic borosilicate zeolite catalysts using tetrapropylammonium hydroxide (TPAOH) as an organic structure-directing agent. The synthesis is carried out using clear homogeneous sols with a specific molar composition of SiO2, B2O3, TPAOH, H2O, and EtOH.

This method appears to be effective for creating catalysts with dispersed boron active sites in a porous framework. However, the literature does not provide information on the relative effectiveness of this method for different catalytic applications compared to other incorporation techniques. Further research would be needed to critically evaluate its effectiveness across various catalytic processes.

含有三维分散活性位点的B基多孔框架材料的结构特征包括：

1. 与晶态沸石相比，具有数个单元晶胞尺寸的超大微孔结构。
2. 高度暴露的小单元晶胞，允许客体分子容易扩散。
3. 由于超大微孔结构，提高了物质传递效率和活性位点的可及性。
4. 嵌入硼原子后，缺陷丰富的沸石结构提供大量SiOH和BOH基团。
5. 通过BOH与相邻SiOH基团之间的氢键，稳定硼物种并构建活性硼中心。

这些特征通过以下方式增强催化性能：

1. 促进反应物和产物通过多孔结构的扩散。
2. 提高活性位点的可及性。
3. 提高物质传递效率。
4. 稳定作为活性位点的硼物种。
5. 通过氢键作用创建活性硼中心。

将B活性组分引入这些结构的方法涉及使用四丙基氢氧化铵（TPAOH）作为有机结构导向剂合成无定形胚胎型硼硅沸石催化剂。合成过程使用具有特定SiO2、B2O3、TPAOH、H2O和EtOH摩尔比的清澈均匀溶胶。

这种方法似乎能有效地创建具有分散硼活性位点的多孔框架催化剂。然而，文献中并未提供该方法相对于其他引入技术在不同催化应用中的相对有效性信息。需要进一步研究以评估其在各种催化过程中的有效性。
