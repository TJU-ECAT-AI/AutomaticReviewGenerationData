          [1] "Compared with crystalline zeolite with microporous structure and saturated coordination framework atoms, embryonic zeolitic materials have the feature of extra-large microporosity with several unit cell dimensions of size."

[2] "The greatly exposed small unit cells allow guest molecules easy to diffuse and the extra-large micropores improve the efficiency of mass transfer and accessibility of the active sites."

[3] "More importantly, after embedding boron atoms, the defect-rich zeolitic structures offer abundant SiOH and BOH groups, which contributed to the stabilization of boron species and construction of active boron centers with proton transfer with adjacent SiOH through hydrogen bonds."

[4] "Boron-containing zeolites have been proven potential in catalyzing the oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) process and the boron sites in open coordination are considered as the active center."

[5] "Solid-state NMR reveals the formation of boron sites in open coordination derived from the defect-rich structure of embryonic borosilicate zeolite, guaranteeing ample exposure of the active center."

[6] "The silanol-rich structure was shown to disperse boron species and limit their detachment from the catalytic system through the redispersion of over-hydrolyzed boron species."

[7] "Structure characterizations and kinetic measurements revealed that the H-bonded BOH groups in defect tri-coordination boron species were responsible for activating propane on the catalysts surface and gas phase, and the reactions in the gas phase were mainly responsible for the high performance in ODHP reaction."

          The structural characteristics of B-based materials with 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks include:

1. Extra-large microporosity: Compared to crystalline zeolites, these materials have larger pore sizes, improving mass transfer and accessibility of active sites.

2. Defect-rich structure: This feature provides abundant SiOH and BOH groups, contributing to the stabilization of boron species and the formation of active boron centers through hydrogen bonding.

3. Open coordination of boron sites: This configuration allows for better exposure of the active centers, increasing their accessibility to reactants.

4. Silanol-rich structure: This helps disperse boron species and prevents their detachment from the catalytic system.

5. H-bonded BOH groups in defect tri-coordination boron species: These are responsible for activating propane on both the catalyst surface and in the gas phase.

These structural characteristics enhance catalytic performance by:

1. Improving diffusion of guest molecules and mass transfer efficiency.
2. Increasing the accessibility and exposure of active sites.
3. Stabilizing boron species within the framework.
4. Facilitating the activation of reactants (e.g., propane in ODHP reactions).
5. Promoting gas-phase reactions, which contribute to high performance in certain catalytic processes.

The primary method used to incorporate B active components into these structures is the synthesis of embryonic borosilicate zeolites. This typically involves using tetrapropylammonium hydroxide (TPAOH) as an organic structure-directing agent and varying the B2O3:SiO2 ratio in the synthesis gel. This approach results in an amorphous, defect-rich zeolitic structure with well-dispersed boron sites.

The effectiveness of this method is demonstrated in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reactions, where embryonic borosilicate zeolite catalysts show improved olefin and propylene selectivity compared to conventional MFI-type borosilicate zeolites. However, the effectiveness for other catalytic applications may vary and requires further investigation.

While this method is effective for creating highly accessible and stable boron sites, it may have limitations in controlling the precise distribution and content of boron in the structure. Alternative methods such as post-synthesis modification might offer more control but could result in less uniform distribution of boron species.

In conclusion, the choice of incorporation method should be based on the specific requirements of the catalytic application, considering factors such as desired boron distribution, stability of active sites, and the nature of the zeolitic framework.

          具有3-D分散活性位点的B基材料在多孔框架中的结构特征包括：

1. 超大微孔：与晶态沸石相比，这些材料具有更大的孔径，改善了质量传递和活性位点的可及性。

2. 缺陷丰富的结构：这一特征提供了丰富的SiOH和BOH基团，有助于硼物种的稳定和通过氢键形成活性硼中心。

3. 硼位点的开放配位：这种构型允许活性中心更好地暴露，增加了它们与反应物的可及性。

4. 硅羟基丰富的结构：这有助于分散硼物种并防止它们从催化系统中脱离。

5. 缺陷三配位硼物种中的H键BOH基团：这些基团负责在催化剂表面和气相中活化丙烷。

这些结构特征通过以下方式增强催化性能：

1. 改善客体分子的扩散和质量传递效率。
2. 增加活性位点的可及性和暴露程度。
3. 稳定框架内的硼物种。
4. 促进反应物的活化（例如ODHP反应中的丙烷）。
5. 促进气相反应，这对某些催化过程的高性能有贡献。

将B活性组分引入这些结构的主要方法是合成胚胎型硼硅沸石。这通常涉及使用四丙基氢氧化铵（TPAOH）作为有机结构导向剂，并在合成凝胶中改变B2O3:SiO2比例。这种方法产生了一种无定形、缺陷丰富的沸石结构，其中硼位点分散良好。

这种方法的有效性在丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）反应中得到了证明，其中胚胎型硼硅沸石催化剂相比传统MFI型硼硅沸石显示出改善的烯烃和丙烯选择性。然而，对其他催化应用的有效性可能会有所不同，需要进一步研究。

虽然这种方法有效地创建了高度可及和稳定的硼位点，但在控制结构中硼的精确分布和含量方面可能存在局限性。后合成修饰等替代方法可能提供更多控制，但可能导致硼物种分布不太均匀。

总之，incorporation方法的选择应基于催化应用的具体要求，考虑诸如所需的硼分布、活性位点的稳定性以及沸石框架的性质等因素。
