[1] "Boron-containing zeolites have been proven potential in catalyzing the oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) process and the boron sites in open coordination are considered as the active center."

[2] "Solid-state NMR reveals the formation of boron sites in open coordination derived from the defect-rich structure of embryonic borosilicate zeolite, guaranteeing ample exposure of the active center."

[3] "The silanol-rich structure was shown to disperse boron species and limit their detachment from the catalytic system through the redispersion of over-hydrolyzed boron species."

[4] "Compared with crystalline zeolite with microporous structure and saturated coordination framework atoms, embryonic zeolitic materials have the feature of extra-large microporosity with several unit cell dimensions of size."

[5] "More importantly, after embedding boron atoms, the defect-rich zeolitic structures offer abundant SiOH and BOH groups, which contributed to the stabilization of boron species and construction of active boron centers with proton transfer with adjacent SiOH through hydrogen bonds."

B-based materials with 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks exhibit several structural characteristics that enhance catalytic performance:

1. Open coordination of boron sites: This configuration allows for better exposure of the active centers, increasing their accessibility to reactants.

2. Defect-rich structure: The presence of defects in the zeolitic framework creates more open coordination sites for boron, further enhancing the exposure of active centers.

3. Extra-large microporosity: Compared to crystalline zeolites, embryonic zeolitic materials feature larger pores, which improve mass transfer and accessibility of active sites.

4. Silanol-rich structure: This feature helps disperse boron species and prevents their detachment from the catalytic system.

5. Abundant SiOH and BOH groups: These groups contribute to the stabilization of boron species and the formation of active boron centers through hydrogen bonding.

These structural characteristics collectively enhance catalytic performance by increasing the number and accessibility of active sites, improving mass transfer, and stabilizing the boron species within the framework.

The methods used to incorporate B active components into these structures include:

1. Direct synthesis: Boron is incorporated during the initial synthesis of the zeolitic material, as demonstrated in the preparation of embryonic borosilicate zeolite catalysts.

2. Post-synthesis modification: This method involves treating pre-synthesized zeolites with boron-containing compounds to introduce boron into the framework.

The effectiveness of these methods can vary depending on the specific catalytic application. Direct synthesis appears to be more effective for creating a uniform distribution of boron throughout the structure and forming the desired open coordination sites. This method is particularly useful for applications requiring a high density of well-dispersed active sites, such as oxidative dehydrogenation of propane.

Post-synthesis modification may be more suitable for fine-tuning the boron content or for introducing boron into pre-existing zeolite structures. However, this method may result in a less uniform distribution of boron and potentially lower stability of the active sites.

In conclusion, the choice of incorporation method should be based on the specific requirements of the catalytic application, considering factors such as desired boron distribution, stability of active sites, and the nature of the zeolitic framework.

具有三维分散活性位点的多孔框架B基材料展现出几个增强催化性能的结构特征：

1. 硼位点的开放配位：这种构型允许活性中心更好地暴露，增加了它们与反应物的可及性。

2. 缺陷丰富的结构：沸石框架中存在的缺陷为硼创造了更多的开放配位位点，进一步增强了活性中心的暴露。

3. 超大微孔：与晶态沸石相比，胚胎沸石材料具有更大的孔隙，这改善了质量传递和活性位点的可及性。

4. 硅羟基丰富的结构：这一特征有助于分散硼物种并防止它们从催化系统中脱离。

5. 丰富的SiOH和BOH基团：这些基团通过氢键作用促进了硼物种的稳定和活性硼中心的形成。

这些结构特征共同通过增加活性位点的数量和可及性、改善质量传递以及稳定框架内的硼物种来增强催化性能。

将B活性组分引入这些结构的方法包括：

1. 直接合成：在沸石材料的初始合成过程中引入硼，如在制备胚胎硼硅沸石催化剂中所示。

2. 后合成修饰：这种方法涉及用含硼化合物处理预先合成的沸石，以将硼引入框架。

这些方法的有效性可能因特定的催化应用而异。直接合成似乎更有效地在整个结构中创建均匀分布的硼，并形成所需的开放配位位点。这种方法特别适用于需要高密度well分散活性位点的应用，如丙烷的氧化脱氢。

后合成修饰可能更适合微调硼含量或将硼引入预先存在的沸石结构中。然而，这种方法可能导致硼分布不太均匀，并可能降低活性位点的稳定性。

总之，incorporation方法的选择应基于催化应用的具体要求，考虑诸如所需的硼分布、活性位点的稳定性以及沸石框架的性质等因素。
