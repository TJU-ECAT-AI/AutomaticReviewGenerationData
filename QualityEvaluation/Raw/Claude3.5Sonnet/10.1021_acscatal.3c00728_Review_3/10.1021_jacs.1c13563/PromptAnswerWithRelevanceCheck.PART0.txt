Read the questions and answers provided below. First, critically assess the overall relevance of the answers provided to the set of questions asked.

If, upon your assessment, you find that the answers do not contain information that is relevant to the questions asked, stop your review process immediately and respond with a single sentence: "※※※※※※※The provided answers are not relevant to the questions.※※※※※※※". Do not provide any additional explanation or background information, only this sentence should be given as a response in case of irrelevant answers.

If, however, the answers are relevant to the questions asked, proceed to compile answers for each question according to the instructions below. Ensure to aggregate all the relevant answers from the multiple answer results provided in the document, and organize them sequentially by their order number, compiling the corresponding quotes, English answers, and Chinese answers for each question.

If the provided answers' quotes are not differentiated by question, ensure to break them down and assign the quotes to each respective question, outputting them separately within each question's section.

To provide a comprehensive review, differentiate the responses into quotes, English answers, and Chinese answers for each question based on the details given in the 'Answer' XML tags. Structure your review using the XML format showcased below if the answers are relevant to the questions asked:

<EnglishVersionAnswer>

The given literature does not provide any information to answer the question about B-based materials with 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks. The text appears to be a truncated citation for a scientific article and does not contain any content related to the structural characteristics, catalytic performance, or methods of incorporating B active components into porous structures. Therefore, this question cannot be answered based on the provided literature.

</EnglishVersionAnswer>

<ChineseVersionAnswer>

所提供的文献并未提供任何关于具有三维分散活性位点的多孔框架中B基材料的信息。该文本似乎是一篇科学文章的不完整引用，不包含任何与结构特征、催化性能或将B活性组分引入多孔结构的方法相关的内容。因此，无法根据所提供的文献回答这个问题。
