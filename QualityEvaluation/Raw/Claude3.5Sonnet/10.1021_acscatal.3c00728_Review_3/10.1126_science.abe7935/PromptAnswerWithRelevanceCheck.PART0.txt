[1] "We report a new active center with a B[OHO(H)Si]2 structure in the borosilicate MFI framework (BS-1) for this reaction that contains only isolated boron species, which differs from general catalysts containing BOB oligomers."

[2] "Such a structure not only efficiently activates molecular oxygen and propane to promote dehydrogenation but also hinders full boron hydrolysis during catalysis."

[3] "The BS-1 catalyst retained this ability after the equivalent treatment (Fig. 1C). Further evaluation of the durability of the BS-1 catalyst was performed in a continuous ODHP test with high propane conversion (32.9 to 43.7%) that might produce 10 vol% water in the gas."

[4] "The zeolite structure was maintained and boron leaching was almost negligible in the reaction for 208 hours, as confirmed by the ICP analysis, N2 sorption, XRD pattern, SEM images, and TEM images of the used catalyst"

[5] "These data all confirm the substantially improved water tolerance of the BS-1 compared with the general boron catalysts, where the zeolite framework hinders the hydrolysis and/or dissolution of boron species by water under humid ODHP conditions."

[6] "The BS-1 catalyst was synthesized from a solvent-free crystallization strategy in the presence of tetrapropylammonium (TPA+) hydroxide from a synthesis gel at 180C for 3 days."

</quotes>

<EnglishVersionAnswer>

The BS-1 catalyst with isolated boron species in a borosilicate MFI framework demonstrates enhanced catalytic performance due to several structural characteristics:

1. Isolated B[OHO(H)Si]2 active centers: These unique structures efficiently activate oxygen and propane for dehydrogenation, differing from conventional BOB oligomers.

2. Hydrolysis resistance: The zeolite framework prevents full boron hydrolysis, maintaining catalyst stability and activity in humid conditions.

3. High durability: The catalyst retains its structure and performance over extended periods (208 hours) with minimal boron leaching.

4. Water tolerance: The zeolite framework significantly improves resistance to hydrolysis and dissolution compared to general boron catalysts.

The method used to incorporate B active components into the porous framework involves a solvent-free crystallization strategy using tetrapropylammonium hydroxide at 180°C for 3 days. This approach appears to be effective for creating isolated boron sites within the zeolite structure, which is crucial for the catalyst's performance in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP).

This synthesis method's effectiveness lies in its ability to create well-dispersed, isolated boron sites that resist agglomeration and maintain stability under reaction conditions. For ODHP applications, this approach shows significant promise due to the resulting catalyst's high activity, selectivity, and durability.

However, the effectiveness of this method for other catalytic applications would depend on the specific reaction requirements and desired catalyst properties. Further research would be needed to determine its suitability for different catalytic processes.

BS-1催化剂在硼硅酸盐MFI框架中具有孤立的硼物种，由于几个结构特征而表现出增强的催化性能：

1. 孤立的B[OHO(H)Si]2活性中心：这些独特的结构能有效激活氧气和丙烷进行脱氢，与传统的BOB寡聚物不同。

2. 耐水解性：沸石框架防止硼完全水解，在潮湿条件下保持催化剂的稳定性和活性。

3. 高耐久性：催化剂在长时间（208小时）内保持其结构和性能，硼浸出最小。

4. 耐水性：与一般的硼催化剂相比，沸石框架显著提高了对水解和溶解的抵抗力。

将B活性组分引入多孔框架的方法涉及使用四丙基铵氢氧化物在180°C下进行3天的无溶剂结晶策略。这种方法似乎能有效地在沸石结构中创建孤立的硼位点，这对催化剂在丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）中的性能至关重要。

这种合成方法的有效性在于其能够创建分散良好、孤立的硼位点，这些位点能够抵抗聚集并在反应条件下保持稳定。对于ODHP应用，由于所得催化剂具有高活性、选择性和耐久性，这种方法显示出重要的前景。

然而，这种方法对其他催化应用的有效性将取决于特定反应的要求和所需的催化剂性质。需要进行进一步的研究来确定其对不同催化过程的适用性。

The structural characteristics of B-based materials with 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks, as exemplified by the BS-1 catalyst, significantly enhance catalytic performance in several ways:

1. Isolated boron species: The BS-1 catalyst contains isolated boron species in a B[OHO(H)Si]2 structure within the borosilicate MFI framework. This differs from conventional catalysts with BOB oligomers and provides unique catalytic properties.

2. Efficient activation: The isolated boron structure efficiently activates molecular oxygen and propane, promoting dehydrogenation reactions.

3. Hydrolysis resistance: The framework hinders full boron hydrolysis during catalysis, contributing to improved durability and water tolerance.

4. Uniform distribution: Boron species are uniformly distributed throughout the silica matrix, ensuring efficient utilization of active sites.

5. Microporous structure: The MFI zeolite structure provides a confined environment that may contribute to enhanced catalytic activity.

The methods used to incorporate B active components into these structures include:

1. Solvent-free crystallization: BS-1 was synthesized using a solvent-free crystallization strategy with tetrapropylammonium hydroxide at 180°C.

2. Framework incorporation: Boron is directly incorporated into the zeolite framework during synthesis, rather than being loaded onto a pre-existing support.

These methods appear to be highly effective for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) applications, as evidenced by the catalyst's high activity, selectivity, and durability. The framework incorporation method is particularly effective in creating isolated boron sites that resist hydrolysis and maintain activity over extended periods.

For other catalytic applications, the effectiveness of these methods may vary depending on the specific reaction requirements. However, the ability to create isolated, uniformly distributed active sites within a stable framework suggests that this approach could be beneficial for a wide range of catalytic processes, especially those requiring high selectivity and resistance to deactivation.

具有三维分散活性位点的B基材料在多孔框架中的结构特征，以BS-1催化剂为例，通过以下几种方式显著提高了催化性能：

1. 孤立的硼物种：BS-1催化剂在硼硅酸盐MFI框架中含有B[OHO(H)Si]2结构的孤立硼物种。这与传统的含有BOB寡聚物的催化剂不同，提供了独特的催化性能。

2. 高效活化：孤立的硼结构能够高效活化分子氧和丙烷，促进脱氢反应。

3. 抗水解性：框架结构抑制了催化过程中硼的完全水解，提高了耐久性和抗水性。

4. 均匀分布：硼物种在硅基质中均匀分布，确保了活性位点的高效利用。

5. 微孔结构：MFI沸石结构提供了一个受限环境，可能有助于提高催化活性。

将B活性组分引入这些结构的方法包括：

1. 无溶剂结晶法：BS-1是在180°C下使用四丙基铵氢氧化物通过无溶剂结晶策略合成的。

2. 框架掺入法：硼在合成过程中直接掺入沸石框架，而不是负载在预先存在的载体上。

这些方法在丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）应用中表现出高效性，证据是催化剂具有高活性、高选择性和高耐久性。框架掺入法在创建抗水解和长期保持活性的孤立硼位点方面特别有效。

对于其他催化应用，这些方法的有效性可能会因具体反应要求而异。然而，在稳定框架内创建孤立、均匀分布的活性位点的能力表明，这种方法可能对广泛的催化过程有益，特别是那些需要高选择性和抗失活性的过程。

The structural characteristics of B-based materials with 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks include:

1. Isolated boron species in zeolite frameworks
2. B[OHO(H)Si]2 structure as the active center
3. Uniform distribution of boron species on the silica matrix
4. Maintenance of zeolite structure during long-term reactions

These features enhance catalytic performance by:

1. Exhibiting high activity and selectivity for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP)
2. Hindering full hydrolysis of boron, preventing leaching in humid atmospheres
3. Providing superior durability in long-period tests
4. Maintaining catalytic activity and stability over extended periods

This method appears to be effective for creating isolated boron sites in the zeolite framework, which is crucial for the observed catalytic performance in ODHP.

The effectiveness of this method for different catalytic applications would depend on the specific reaction requirements. For ODHP, it proves highly effective due to the formation of stable, isolated boron sites that resist hydrolysis and maintain activity. However, for reactions that may benefit from different boron configurations or require alternative framework structures, this specific method might need modification or alternative approaches may be necessary.

Critical evaluation of this method shows its strengths in creating well-dispersed, isolated boron sites and producing a stable catalyst structure. However, limitations may include the specific nature of the resulting boron sites, which may not be suitable for all catalytic applications. Further research into adaptations of this method or development of new incorporation techniques could expand its applicability to a broader range of catalytic processes.
