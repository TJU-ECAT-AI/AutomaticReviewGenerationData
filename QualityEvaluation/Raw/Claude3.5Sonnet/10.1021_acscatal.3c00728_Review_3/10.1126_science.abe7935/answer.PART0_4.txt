[1] "Herein, we report a new active center with a B[OHO(H)Si]2 structure in the borosilicate MFI framework (BS-1) for this reaction that contains only isolated boron species, which differs from general catalysts containing BOB oligomers."

[2] "Such a structure not only efficiently activates molecular oxygen and propane to promote dehydrogenation but also hinders full boron hydrolysis during catalysis."

[3] "The BS-1 catalyst was synthesized from a solvent-free crystallization strategy in the presence of tetrapropylammonium (TPA+) hydroxide from a synthesis gel at 180C for 3 days."

[4] "Energy dispersive spectroscopic elemental maps of the BS-1 catalyst revealed uniform distribution of boron species on the silica matrix"

The structural characteristics of B-based materials with 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks include:

1. Isolated boron species: The active centers consist of B[OHO(H)Si]2 structures in the borosilicate MFI framework, differing from typical BOB oligomers.

2. Uniform distribution: Boron species are uniformly distributed throughout the silica matrix.

3. Stable framework: The zeolite structure remains intact during long reaction periods, with minimal boron leaching.

These features enhance catalytic performance by:

1. Efficient activation: The isolated boron sites effectively activate oxygen and propane for dehydrogenation.

2. Hydrolysis resistance: The structure hinders full boron hydrolysis during catalysis, improving durability.

3. Confinement effect: The zeolite microporous structure contributes to reaction activity.

The method used to incorporate B active components into these structures involves:

1. Solvent-free crystallization: Synthesis using tetrapropylammonium hydroxide in a gel at 180°C for 3 days.

This method appears effective for creating isolated boron sites in zeolite frameworks for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP). However, the literature does not provide information on its effectiveness for other catalytic applications. Further research would be needed to evaluate its broader applicability.

The incorporation method's effectiveness lies in its ability to create isolated, stable boron sites within the zeolite framework, which is crucial for the desired catalytic performance in ODHP. However, the lack of comparison with other incorporation methods in the literature limits a comprehensive evaluation of its relative effectiveness.

基于硼的材料在多孔框架中具有3D分散活性位点的结构特征包括：

1. 孤立的硼物种：活性中心由硼硅酸盐MFI框架中的B[OHO(H)Si]2结构组成，不同于典型的BOB寡聚体。

2. 均匀分布：硼物种在硅基质中均匀分布。

3. 稳定框架：在长时间反应期间，沸石结构保持完整，硼的流失极少。

这些特征通过以下方式增强催化性能：

1. 高效活化：孤立的硼位点有效地活化氧气和丙烷进行脱氢。

2. 抗水解性：该结构在催化过程中阻碍硼的完全水解，提高耐久性。

3. 限域效应：沸石微孔结构有助于反应活性。

将B活性组分引入这些结构的方法包括：

1. 无溶剂结晶：在180°C下使用四丙基铵氢氧化物在凝胶中合成3天。

这种方法似乎对于在沸石框架中创建用于丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）的孤立硼位点是有效的。然而，文献没有提供关于其对其他催化应用有效性的信息。需要进一步研究来评估其更广泛的适用性。

该引入方法的有效性在于其能够在沸石框架内创建孤立、稳定的硼位点，这对于ODHP中所需的催化性能至关重要。然而，文献中缺乏与其他引入方法的比较，限制了对其相对有效性的全面评估。
