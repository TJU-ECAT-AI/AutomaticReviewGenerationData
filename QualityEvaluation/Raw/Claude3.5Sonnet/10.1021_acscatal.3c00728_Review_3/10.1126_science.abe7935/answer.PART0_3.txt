[1] "We show here that the isolated boron in a zeolite framework without such oligomers exhibits high activity and selectivity for ODHP, which also hinders full hydrolysis for boron leaching in a humid atmosphere because of the BOSiOx linkage, achieving superior durability in a long-period test."

[2] "Herein, we report a new active center with a B[OHO(H)Si]2 structure in the borosilicate MFI framework (BS-1) for this reaction that contains only isolated boron species, which differs from general catalysts containing BOB oligomers."

[3] "The BS-1 catalyst was synthesized from a solvent-free crystallization strategy in the presence of tetrapropylammonium (TPA+) hydroxide from a synthesis gel at 180C for 3 days."

[4] "Energy dispersive spectroscopic elemental maps of the BS-1 catalyst revealed uniform distribution of boron species on the silica matrix"

[5] "The zeolite structure was maintained and boron leaching was almost negligible in the reaction for 208 hours, as confirmed by the ICP analysis, N2 sorption, XRD pattern, SEM images, and TEM images of the used catalyst"

The structural characteristics of B-based materials with 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks include:

1. Isolated boron species in zeolite frameworks
2. B[OHO(H)Si]2 structure as the active center
3. Uniform distribution of boron species on the silica matrix
4. Maintenance of zeolite structure during long-term reactions

These features enhance catalytic performance by:

1. Exhibiting high activity and selectivity for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP)
2. Hindering full hydrolysis of boron, preventing leaching in humid atmospheres
3. Providing superior durability in long-period tests
4. Maintaining catalytic activity and stability over extended periods

The method used to incorporate B active components into these structures is a solvent-free crystallization strategy using tetrapropylammonium (TPA+) hydroxide at 180°C for 3 days. This method appears to be effective for creating isolated boron sites in the zeolite framework, which is crucial for the observed catalytic performance in ODHP.

The effectiveness of this method for different catalytic applications would depend on the specific reaction requirements. For ODHP, it proves highly effective due to the formation of stable, isolated boron sites that resist hydrolysis and maintain activity. However, for reactions that may benefit from different boron configurations or require alternative framework structures, this specific method might need modification or alternative approaches may be necessary.

Critical evaluation of this method shows its strengths in creating well-dispersed, isolated boron sites and producing a stable catalyst structure. However, limitations may include the specific nature of the resulting boron sites, which may not be suitable for all catalytic applications. Further research into adaptations of this method or development of new incorporation techniques could expand its applicability to a broader range of catalytic processes.

基于B的材料在多孔框架中具有3-D分散活性位点的结构特征包括：

1. 沸石框架中的孤立硼物种
2. B[OHO(H)Si]2结构作为活性中心
3. 硼物种在硅基质上的均匀分布
4. 在长期反应中保持沸石结构

这些特征通过以下方式提高催化性能：

1. 对丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）表现出高活性和选择性
2. 阻碍硼的完全水解，防止在潮湿环境中流失
3. 在长期测试中提供卓越的耐久性
4. 在长时间内保持催化活性和稳定性

将B活性组分引入这些结构的方法是使用四丙基铵(TPA+)氢氧化物在180°C下进行3天的无溶剂结晶策略。这种方法似乎对于在沸石框架中创建孤立的硼位点非常有效，这对于ODHP中观察到的催化性能至关重要。

这种方法对不同催化应用的有效性取决于特定反应的要求。对于ODHP，由于形成了稳定的、抗水解的孤立硼位点并保持活性，因此证明非常有效。然而，对于可能受益于不同硼构型或需要替代框架结构的反应，这种特定方法可能需要修改，或者可能需要替代方法。

对这种方法的批评性评价显示了它在创建分散良好的孤立硼位点和产生稳定催化剂结构方面的优势。然而，局限性可能包括所得硼位点的特定性质，这可能不适用于所有催化应用。对这种方法的进一步研究或开发新的引入技术可能会扩大其在更广泛催化过程中的适用性。
