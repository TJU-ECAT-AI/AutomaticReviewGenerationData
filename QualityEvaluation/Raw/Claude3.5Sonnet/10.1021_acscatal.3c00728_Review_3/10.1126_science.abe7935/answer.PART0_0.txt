[1] "We report a new active center with a B[OHO(H)Si]2 structure in the borosilicate MFI framework (BS-1) for this reaction that contains only isolated boron species, which differs from general catalysts containing BOB oligomers."

[2] "Such a structure not only efficiently activates molecular oxygen and propane to promote dehydrogenation but also hinders full boron hydrolysis during catalysis."

[3] "The BS-1 catalyst retained this ability after the equivalent treatment (Fig. 1C). Further evaluation of the durability of the BS-1 catalyst was performed in a continuous ODHP test with high propane conversion (32.9 to 43.7%) that might produce 10 vol% water in the gas."

[4] "The zeolite structure was maintained and boron leaching was almost negligible in the reaction for 208 hours, as confirmed by the ICP analysis, N2 sorption, XRD pattern, SEM images, and TEM images of the used catalyst"

[5] "These data all confirm the substantially improved water tolerance of the BS-1 compared with the general boron catalysts, where the zeolite framework hinders the hydrolysis and/or dissolution of boron species by water under humid ODHP conditions."

The BS-1 catalyst with isolated boron species in a borosilicate MFI framework demonstrates enhanced catalytic performance due to several structural characteristics:

1. Isolated B[OHO(H)Si]2 active centers: These unique structures efficiently activate oxygen and propane for dehydrogenation, differing from conventional BOB oligomers.

2. Hydrolysis resistance: The zeolite framework prevents full boron hydrolysis, maintaining catalyst stability and activity in humid conditions.

3. High durability: The catalyst retains its structure and performance over extended periods (208 hours) with minimal boron leaching.

4. Water tolerance: The zeolite framework significantly improves resistance to hydrolysis and dissolution compared to general boron catalysts.

The method used to incorporate B active components into the porous framework involves a solvent-free crystallization strategy using tetrapropylammonium hydroxide at 180°C for 3 days. This approach appears to be effective for creating isolated boron sites within the zeolite structure, which is crucial for the catalyst's performance in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP).

This synthesis method's effectiveness lies in its ability to create well-dispersed, isolated boron sites that resist agglomeration and maintain stability under reaction conditions. For ODHP applications, this approach shows significant promise due to the resulting catalyst's high activity, selectivity, and durability.

However, the effectiveness of this method for other catalytic applications would depend on the specific reaction requirements and desired catalyst properties. Further research would be needed to determine its suitability for different catalytic processes.

BS-1催化剂在硼硅酸盐MFI框架中具有孤立的硼物种，由于几个结构特征而表现出增强的催化性能：

1. 孤立的B[OHO(H)Si]2活性中心：这些独特的结构能有效激活氧气和丙烷进行脱氢，与传统的BOB寡聚物不同。

2. 耐水解性：沸石框架防止硼完全水解，在潮湿条件下保持催化剂的稳定性和活性。

3. 高耐久性：催化剂在长时间（208小时）内保持其结构和性能，硼浸出最小。

4. 耐水性：与一般的硼催化剂相比，沸石框架显著提高了对水解和溶解的抵抗力。

将B活性组分引入多孔框架的方法涉及使用四丙基铵氢氧化物在180°C下进行3天的无溶剂结晶策略。这种方法似乎能有效地在沸石结构中创建孤立的硼位点，这对催化剂在丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）中的性能至关重要。

这种合成方法的有效性在于其能够创建分散良好、孤立的硼位点，这些位点能够抵抗聚集并在反应条件下保持稳定。对于ODHP应用，由于所得催化剂具有高活性、选择性和耐久性，这种方法显示出重要的前景。

然而，这种方法对其他催化应用的有效性将取决于特定反应的要求和所需的催化剂性质。需要进行进一步的研究来确定其对不同催化过程的适用性。
