[1] "Herein, we report a new active center with a B[OHO(H)Si]2 structure in the borosilicate MFI framework (BS-1) for this reaction that contains only isolated boron species, which differs from general catalysts containing BOB oligomers."

[2] "Such a structure not only efficiently activates molecular oxygen and propane to promote dehydrogenation but also hinders full boron hydrolysis during catalysis."

[3] "The BS-1 catalyst was synthesized from a solvent-free crystallization strategy in the presence of tetrapropylammonium (TPA+) hydroxide from a synthesis gel at 180C for 3 days."

[4] "Energy dispersive spectroscopic elemental maps of the BS-1 catalyst revealed uniform distribution of boron species on the silica matrix"

[5] "The zeolite structure was maintained and boron leaching was almost negligible in the reaction for 208 hours, as confirmed by the ICP analysis, N2 sorption, XRD pattern, SEM images, and TEM images of the used catalyst"

The structural characteristics of B-based materials with 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks include:

1. Isolated boron species in a zeolite framework, specifically with a B[OHO(H)Si]2 structure in the case of BS-1.

2. Uniform distribution of boron species throughout the silica matrix.

3. Maintenance of the zeolite structure even after long periods of catalytic use.

These features enhance catalytic performance by:

1. Efficiently activating molecular oxygen and propane to promote dehydrogenation.

2. Hindering full boron hydrolysis during catalysis, leading to improved durability.

3. Preventing boron leaching, maintaining catalyst stability over extended periods.

The method used to incorporate B active components into these structures, as described in the literature, is a solvent-free crystallization strategy. This method involves:

1. Using tetrapropylammonium (TPA+) hydroxide in the synthesis gel.

2. Crystallization at 180°C for 3 days.

This method appears to be effective for creating isolated boron sites within the zeolite framework, which is crucial for the catalytic application of oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP). The effectiveness of this method is demonstrated by:

1. The high activity and selectivity of the resulting catalyst in ODHP.

2. The excellent durability of the catalyst, maintaining performance over extended periods.

3. The uniform distribution of boron species achieved in the final structure.

However, the literature does not provide information on the effectiveness of this method for other catalytic applications or compare it to alternative methods of incorporating boron into porous frameworks. Further research would be needed to evaluate its broader applicability and relative effectiveness across different catalytic processes.

具有三维分散活性位点的B基材料在多孔框架中的结构特征包括：

1. 沸石框架中的孤立硼物种，特别是BS-1中的B[OHO(H)Si]2结构。

2. 硼物种在硅基质中的均匀分布。

3. 即使在长时间的催化使用后，沸石结构仍能保持。

这些特征通过以下方式增强催化性能：

1. 有效激活分子氧和丙烷，促进脱氢。

2. 在催化过程中阻碍硼的完全水解，从而提高耐久性。

3. 防止硼的流失，保持催化剂在长时间内的稳定性。

文献中描述的将B活性成分引入这些结构的方法是无溶剂结晶策略。该方法包括：

1. 在合成凝胶中使用四丙基铵(TPA+)氢氧化物。

2. 在180°C下结晶3天。

这种方法似乎对于在沸石框架内创建孤立的硼位点很有效，这对于丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）的催化应用至关重要。该方法的有效性通过以下方面得到证明：

1. 所得催化剂在ODHP中表现出高活性和选择性。

2. 催化剂具有优异的耐久性，能在长时间内保持性能。

3. 在最终结构中实现硼物种的均匀分布。

然而，文献并未提供该方法对其他催化应用的有效性信息，也没有将其与其他将硼引入多孔框架的替代方法进行比较。需要进一步研究来评估其在不同催化过程中的广泛适用性和相对有效性。
