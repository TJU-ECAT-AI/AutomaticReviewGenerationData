The structural characteristics of B-based materials with 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks, as exemplified by the BS-1 catalyst, significantly enhance catalytic performance in several ways:

1. Isolated boron species: The BS-1 catalyst contains isolated boron species in a B[OHO(H)Si]2 structure within the borosilicate MFI framework. This differs from conventional catalysts with BOB oligomers and provides unique catalytic properties.

2. Efficient activation: The isolated boron structure efficiently activates molecular oxygen and propane, promoting dehydrogenation reactions.

3. Hydrolysis resistance: The framework hinders full boron hydrolysis during catalysis, contributing to improved durability and water tolerance.

4. Uniform distribution: Boron species are uniformly distributed throughout the silica matrix, ensuring efficient utilization of active sites.

5. Microporous structure: The MFI zeolite structure provides a confined environment that may contribute to enhanced catalytic activity.

The methods used to incorporate B active components into these structures include:

1. Solvent-free crystallization: BS-1 was synthesized using a solvent-free crystallization strategy with tetrapropylammonium hydroxide at 180°C.

2. Framework incorporation: Boron is directly incorporated into the zeolite framework during synthesis, rather than being loaded onto a pre-existing support.

These methods appear to be highly effective for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) applications, as evidenced by the catalyst's high activity, selectivity, and durability. The framework incorporation method is particularly effective in creating isolated boron sites that resist hydrolysis and maintain activity over extended periods.

For other catalytic applications, the effectiveness of these methods may vary depending on the specific reaction requirements. However, the ability to create isolated, uniformly distributed active sites within a stable framework suggests that this approach could be beneficial for a wide range of catalytic processes, especially those requiring high selectivity and resistance to deactivation.

具有三维分散活性位点的B基材料在多孔框架中的结构特征，以BS-1催化剂为例，通过以下几种方式显著提高了催化性能：

1. 孤立的硼物种：BS-1催化剂在硼硅酸盐MFI框架中含有B[OHO(H)Si]2结构的孤立硼物种。这与传统的含有BOB寡聚物的催化剂不同，提供了独特的催化性能。

2. 高效活化：孤立的硼结构能够高效活化分子氧和丙烷，促进脱氢反应。

3. 抗水解性：框架结构抑制了催化过程中硼的完全水解，提高了耐久性和抗水性。

4. 均匀分布：硼物种在硅基质中均匀分布，确保了活性位点的高效利用。

5. 微孔结构：MFI沸石结构提供了一个受限环境，可能有助于提高催化活性。

将B活性组分引入这些结构的方法包括：

1. 无溶剂结晶法：BS-1是在180°C下使用四丙基铵氢氧化物通过无溶剂结晶策略合成的。

2. 框架掺入法：硼在合成过程中直接掺入沸石框架，而不是负载在预先存在的载体上。

这些方法在丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）应用中表现出高效性，证据是催化剂具有高活性、高选择性和高耐久性。框架掺入法在创建抗水解和长期保持活性的孤立硼位点方面特别有效。

对于其他催化应用，这些方法的有效性可能会因具体反应要求而异。然而，在稳定框架内创建孤立、均匀分布的活性位点的能力表明，这种方法可能对广泛的催化过程有益，特别是那些需要高选择性和抗失活性的过程。
