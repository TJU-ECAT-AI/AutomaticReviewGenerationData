The structural characteristics of B-based materials with 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks include:

1. One-dimensional porous nanofiber structure
2. Uniform dispersion of boron species on the open silica fiber framework
3. Accessible mesoporous characteristics with pore sizes around 4 nm
4. Highly dispersed B2O3 species within the fiber structure
5. Immobilization of tri- and tetra-coordinated boron species via BOSi bridges

These structural features enhance catalytic performance by:

1. Preventing diffusion limitations
2. Ensuring high catalytic activity at high weight hourly space velocity (WHSV)
3. Providing higher olefin selectivity and stability compared to other supported boron oxide catalysts

The method used to incorporate B active components into these structures is electrospinning, which is highly effective for creating one-dimensional porous boron-doped silica nanofibers (PBSN) in a single step. This method ensures uniform dispersion and stability of boron species on the open silica fiber framework.

The effectiveness of electrospinning for incorporating B active components is particularly high for oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of alkanes, as demonstrated by the superior performance of PBSN catalysts in this application. The method allows for precise control of the porous structure and boron dispersion, which are crucial for achieving high catalytic activity and selectivity in ODH reactions.

However, the literature does not provide information on the effectiveness of this method for other catalytic applications. To fully evaluate its relative effectiveness across different catalytic processes, further research would be needed to compare PBSN catalysts with other B-based materials in various reactions.

具有三维分散活性位点的B基材料在多孔框架中的结构特征包括：

1. 一维多孔纳米纤维结构
2. 硼物种在开放的硅纤维框架上均匀分散
3. 具有约4纳米孔径的可及性介孔特征
4. 高度分散在纤维结构中的B2O3物种
5. 通过BOSi桥键固定的三配位和四配位硼物种

这些结构特征通过以下方式增强催化性能：

1. 防止扩散限制
2. 确保在高重时空速度（WHSV）下的高催化活性
3. 与其他负载型硼氧化物催化剂相比，提供更高的烯烃选择性和稳定性

用于将B活性组分引入这些结构的方法是静电纺丝，这种方法在一步中创建一维多孔硼掺杂二氧化硅纳米纤维（PBSN）非常有效。该方法确保了硼物种在开放的硅纤维框架上的均匀分散和稳定性。

静电纺丝法在引入B活性组分方面的有效性在烷烃氧化脱氢（ODH）反应中表现尤为突出，这一点通过PBSN催化剂在该应用中的优异性能得到了证实。该方法允许精确控制多孔结构和硼的分散，这对于在ODH反应中实现高催化活性和选择性至关重要。

然而，文献中并未提供该方法在其他催化应用中的有效性信息。要全面评估其在不同催化过程中的相对有效性，需要进一步研究，比较PBSN催化剂与其他B基材料在各种反应中的表现。
