[1] "Electrospinning was employed for the synthesis of one-dimensional porous boron-doped silica nanofiber (PBSN) catalysts in one step."

[2] "The results of the catalytic tests confirmed that the PBSN catalyst showed higher olefin selectivity and catalytic stability in the ODH of ethane and propane."

[3] "Electrospinning ensures high dispersion and stability of boron species on the surface of the open silica nanofiber framework in ODH processes."

[4] "The TEM image of PBSN-3 (Fig. 1(c)) shows a porous structure associated with a homogeneous distribution of Si, B, and O elements in the entire catalyst"

[5] "The 11B NMR analysis showed that the tri- and tetra-coordinated boron species were immobilized on the catalysts via BOSi bridges, which is consistent with the FTIR results."

[6] "The boron species were almost unchanged in the PBSN-3 catalyst, suggesting that they were stably immobilized on the PBSN catalyst compared to the supported ones."

The structural characteristics of B-based materials with 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks include:

1. One-dimensional porous nanofiber structure
2. Homogeneous distribution of Si, B, and O elements
3. High dispersion and stability of boron species on the open silica nanofiber framework
4. Immobilization of tri- and tetra-coordinated boron species via BOSi bridges

These features enhance catalytic performance by:

1. Providing easy diffusion and ensuring high catalytic activity at high WHSV
2. Offering uniform and stable catalyst structure
3. Maintaining catalytic stability even at high space velocity
4. Preventing aggregation of B2O3 and maintaining high dispersion of active sites

The method used to incorporate B active components into these structures is electrospinning. This method is highly effective for catalytic applications because:

1. It allows for one-step synthesis of porous boron-doped silica nanofiber catalysts
2. It ensures high dispersion and stability of boron species on the surface of the open silica nanofiber framework
3. It creates a uniform and stable catalyst structure that maintains its integrity during reactions
4. It results in stably immobilized boron species compared to supported catalysts

The electrospinning method appears to be particularly effective for oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) reactions of light alkanes, as evidenced by the higher olefin selectivity and catalytic stability shown by the PBSN catalysts in the ODH of ethane and propane. This method addresses limitations of traditional supported catalysts, such as aggregation of active components and instability during reactions.

具有三维分散活性位点的B基材料在多孔框架中的结构特征包括：

1. 一维多孔纳米纤维结构
2. Si、B和O元素的均匀分布
3. 硼物种在开放式硅纳米纤维框架上的高度分散和稳定性
4. 通过BOSi桥键固定的三配位和四配位硼物种

这些特征通过以下方式增强催化性能：

1. 提供易扩散性，确保在高WHSV下的高催化活性
2. 提供均匀和稳定的催化剂结构
3. 即使在高空速下也保持催化稳定性
4. 防止B2O3聚集并保持活性位点的高分散性

将B活性组分引入这些结构的方法是电纺丝。这种方法对催化应用非常有效，因为：

1. 它允许一步合成多孔硼掺杂二氧化硅纳米纤维催化剂
2. 它确保硼物种在开放式硅纳米纤维框架表面上的高度分散和稳定性
3. 它创造了一个均匀和稳定的催化剂结构，在反应过程中保持其完整性
4. 与负载型催化剂相比，它产生稳定固定的硼物种

电纺丝方法似乎对轻烷烃的氧化脱氢（ODH）反应特别有效，这从PBSN催化剂在乙烷和丙烷ODH反应中表现出的更高烯烃选择性和催化稳定性可以看出。这种方法解决了传统负载型催化剂的局限性，如活性组分聚集和反应过程中的不稳定性。
