[1] "Electrospinning was employed for the synthesis of one-dimensional porous boron-doped silica nanofiber (PBSN) catalysts in one step."

[2] "The results of the catalytic tests confirmed that the PBSN catalyst showed higher olefin selectivity and catalytic stability in the ODH of ethane and propane."

[3] "Electrospinning ensures high dispersion and stability of boron species on the surface of the open silica nanofiber framework in ODH processes."

[4] "The TEM image of PBSN-3 (Fig. 1(c)) shows a porous structure associated with a homogeneous distribution of Si, B, and O elements in the entire catalyst (Fig. 1(d))."

[5] "The N2 physical sorption isotherms of the PBSN catalysts (Fig. 2(a)) showed a type-IV shape, indicating their accessible mesoporous characteristics."

[6] "B2O3 signals were not observed, suggesting that the B2O3 species may be highly dispersed in the fiber structure, together with the results of STEM-EDX mapping."

[7] "The peaks at 1425 and 1370 cm−1 correspond to the signals of trigonal BO3 units"

[8] "The bending of the B–O–Si peak was detected at 920 cm−1, indicating that the BO species were bridged by chemical bonds in the catalysts."

The structural characteristics of B-based materials with 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks include:

1. One-dimensional porous nanofiber structure
2. Homogeneous distribution of Si, B, and O elements
3. Accessible mesoporous characteristics
4. Highly dispersed B2O3 species within the fiber structure
5. Presence of trigonal BO3 units
6. BO species bridged by chemical bonds to the silica framework

These features enhance catalytic performance by:

1. Providing high surface area and accessibility to active sites
2. Ensuring uniform distribution of active components
3. Facilitating mass transfer and diffusion of reactants/products
4. Stabilizing the active boron species
5. Creating synergistic effects between boron and silica components

The primary method used to incorporate B active components into these structures is electrospinning. This technique is highly effective for creating B-based catalysts for oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) reactions, as it ensures:

1. One-step synthesis of porous boron-doped silica nanofibers
2. High dispersion and stability of boron species on the silica framework
3. Formation of an open nanofiber structure that enhances catalytic activity
4. Strong interaction between boron and silica through B-O-Si bonds

Compared to traditional impregnation methods, electrospinning appears to be more effective in creating stable and highly dispersed boron-based catalysts for ODH reactions. The resulting materials show higher olefin selectivity and catalytic stability, making them particularly suitable for light alkane ODH applications. However, the effectiveness of this method for other catalytic applications would require further investigation and comparison with alternative synthesis techniques.

具有三维分散活性位点的B基材料在多孔框架中的结构特征包括：

1. 一维多孔纳米纤维结构
2. Si、B和O元素的均匀分布
3. 可访问的介孔特性
4. 高度分散在纤维结构中的B2O3物种
5. 存在三角形BO3单元
6. 通过化学键与二氧化硅骨架桥接的BO物种

这些特征通过以下方式增强催化性能：

1. 提供高比表面积和活性位点的可及性
2. 确保活性组分的均匀分布
3. 促进反应物/产物的质量传递和扩散
4. 稳定活性硼物种
5. 在硼和二氧化硅组分之间创造协同效应

将B活性组分引入这些结构的主要方法是电纺丝。这种技术对于创建用于氧化脱氢（ODH）反应的B基催化剂非常有效，因为它确保：

1. 一步合成多孔掺硼二氧化硅纳米纤维
2. 硼物种在二氧化硅骨架上的高度分散和稳定性
3. 形成增强催化活性的开放纳米纤维结构
4. 通过B-O-Si键实现硼和二氧化硅之间的强相互作用

与传统的浸渍方法相比，电纺丝在创建稳定和高度分散的硼基催化剂用于ODH反应方面似乎更有效。由此产生的材料显示出更高的烯烃选择性和催化稳定性，使其特别适用于轻烷烃ODH应用。然而，这种方法对其他催化应用的有效性还需要进一步研究和与其他合成技术进行比较。
