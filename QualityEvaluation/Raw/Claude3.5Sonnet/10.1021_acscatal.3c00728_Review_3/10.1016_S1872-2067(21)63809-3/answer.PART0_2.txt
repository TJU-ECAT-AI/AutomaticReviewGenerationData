[1] "Electrospinning was employed for the synthesis of one-dimensional porous boron-doped silica nanofiber (PBSN) catalysts in one step."

[2] "The results of the catalytic tests confirmed that the PBSN catalyst showed higher olefin selectivity and catalytic stability in the ODH of ethane and propane."

[3] "Electrospinning ensures high dispersion and stability of boron species on the surface of the open silica nanofiber framework in ODH processes."

[4] "The TEM image of PBSN-3 (Fig. 1(c)) shows a porous structure associated with a homogeneous distribution of Si, B, and O elements in the entire catalyst (Fig. 1(d))."

[5] "The 11B NMR analysis showed that the tri- and tetra-coordinated boron species were immobilized on the catalysts via BOSi bridges, which is consistent with the FTIR results."

[6] "The boron species were almost unchanged in the PBSN-3 catalyst, suggesting that they were stably immobilized on the PBSN catalyst compared to the supported ones."

The structural characteristics of B-based materials with 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks include:

1. One-dimensional porous nanofiber structure
2. Homogeneous distribution of Si, B, and O elements
3. High dispersion and stability of boron species on the surface
4. Immobilization of tri- and tetra-coordinated boron species via BOSi bridges

These features enhance catalytic performance by:

1. Providing easy diffusion and ensuring high catalytic activity at high WHSV
2. Offering a large surface area for catalytic reactions
3. Maintaining stability of active boron species during reactions
4. Preventing aggregation of boron species

The method used to incorporate B active components into these structures is electrospinning. This technique is highly effective for creating porous boron-doped silica nanofibers in a single step. It ensures uniform dispersion and stability of boron species on the open silica nanofiber framework, which is particularly beneficial for oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) processes.

Compared to other methods like impregnation on various supports (e.g., TiO2, SiO2, Al2O3), electrospinning appears to be more effective in creating stable and highly dispersed boron species. This results in higher olefin selectivity and catalytic stability in the ODH of ethane and propane.

For ODH catalytic applications, the electrospinning method shows superior performance due to the stable immobilization of boron species and the maintenance of the porous structure during reactions. However, the effectiveness of this method for other catalytic applications would require further investigation, as the study primarily focused on ODH reactions.

B基材料在多孔框架中具有3-D分散活性位点的结构特征包括：

1. 一维多孔纳米纤维结构
2. Si、B和O元素的均匀分布
3. 表面上硼物种的高分散性和稳定性
4. 通过BOSi桥键固定的三配位和四配位硼物种

这些特征通过以下方式增强催化性能：

1. 提供易扩散性并确保在高WHSV下的高催化活性
2. 为催化反应提供大表面积
3. 在反应过程中维持活性硼物种的稳定性
4. 防止硼物种的聚集

将B活性组分引入这些结构的方法是电纺丝。这种技术在一步中创建多孔硼掺杂二氧化硅纳米纤维方面非常有效。它确保了硼物种在开放的二氧化硅纳米纤维框架上的均匀分散和稳定性，这对氧化脱氢（ODH）过程特别有利。

与其他方法（如在各种载体上如TiO2、SiO2、Al2O3进行浸渍）相比，电纺丝在创建稳定和高度分散的硼物种方面似乎更有效。这导致了乙烷和丙烷ODH反应中更高的烯烃选择性和催化稳定性。

对于ODH催化应用，由于硼物种的稳定固定和反应过程中多孔结构的维持，电纺丝方法显示出优越的性能。然而，这种方法对其他催化应用的有效性还需要进一步研究，因为该研究主要集中在ODH反应上。
