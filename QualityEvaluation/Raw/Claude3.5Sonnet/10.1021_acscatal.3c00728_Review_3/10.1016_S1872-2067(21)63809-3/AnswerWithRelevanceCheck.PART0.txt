          [1] "Electrospinning was employed for the synthesis of one-dimensional porous boron-doped silica nanofiber (PBSN) catalysts in one step."

[2] "The TEM image of PBSN-3 (Fig. 1(c)) shows a porous structure associated with a homogeneous distribution of Si, B, and O elements in the entire catalyst"

[3] "The N2 physical sorption isotherms of the PBSN catalysts (Fig. 2(a)) showed a type-IV shape, indicating their accessible mesoporous characteristics."

[4] "The 11B NMR analysis showed that the tri- and tetra-coordinated boron species were immobilized on the catalysts via BOSi bridges, which is consistent with the FTIR results."

[5] "B2O3 signals were not observed, suggesting that the B2O3 species may be highly dispersed in the fiber structure, together with the results of STEM-EDX mapping."

[6] "The one-dimensional nanofibers with open pore structures not only prevented diffusion limitation but also guaranteed high catalytic activity at high weight hourly space velocity (WHSV) in the ODH of alkanes."

[7] "Compared to other supported boron oxide catalysts, PBSN catalysts showed higher olefin selectivity and stability."

          The structural characteristics of B-based materials with 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks include:

1. One-dimensional porous nanofiber structure
2. Homogeneous distribution of Si, B, and O elements
3. Accessible mesoporous characteristics
4. Highly dispersed B2O3 species within the fiber structure
5. Immobilization of tri- and tetra-coordinated boron species via BOSi bridges
6. Open pore structures

These features enhance catalytic performance by:

1. Preventing diffusion limitations
2. Ensuring high catalytic activity at high weight hourly space velocity (WHSV)
3. Providing higher olefin selectivity and stability compared to other supported boron oxide catalysts
4. Offering a large surface area for catalytic reactions
5. Maintaining stability of active boron species during reactions

The primary method used to incorporate B active components into these structures is electrospinning. This technique is highly effective for creating porous boron-doped silica nanofibers in a single step. It ensures:

1. Uniform dispersion and stability of boron species on the open silica nanofiber framework
2. Formation of an open nanofiber structure that enhances catalytic activity
3. Strong interaction between boron and silica through B-O-Si bonds

Electrospinning appears to be particularly effective for oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) reactions of light alkanes, as evidenced by the higher olefin selectivity and catalytic stability shown by the PBSN catalysts. This method addresses limitations of traditional supported catalysts, such as aggregation of active components and instability during reactions.

However, the effectiveness of this method for other catalytic applications would require further investigation and comparison with alternative synthesis techniques. While the structural characteristics achieved through electrospinning are generally beneficial for many heterogeneous catalytic processes, its relative effectiveness across different catalytic applications needs more comprehensive research.

          具有三维分散活性位点的B基材料在多孔框架中的结构特征包括：

1. 一维多孔纳米纤维结构
2. Si、B和O元素的均匀分布
3. 可及的介孔特性
4. 高度分散在纤维结构中的B2O3物种
5. 通过BOSi桥键固定的三配位和四配位硼物种
6. 开放的孔结构

这些特征通过以下方式增强催化性能：

1. 防止扩散限制
2. 确保在高重时空速度（WHSV）下的高催化活性
3. 与其他负载型硼氧化物催化剂相比，提供更高的烯烃选择性和稳定性
4. 为催化反应提供大表面积
5. 在反应过程中维持活性硼物种的稳定性

将B活性组分引入这些结构的主要方法是电纺丝。这种技术在一步中创建多孔硼掺杂二氧化硅纳米纤维方面非常有效。它确保：

1. 硼物种在开放的二氧化硅纳米纤维框架上的均匀分散和稳定性
2. 形成增强催化活性的开放纳米纤维结构
3. 通过B-O-Si键实现硼和二氧化硅之间的强相互作用

电纺丝方法似乎对轻烷烃的氧化脱氢（ODH）反应特别有效，这从PBSN催化剂表现出的更高烯烃选择性和催化稳定性可以看出。这种方法解决了传统负载型催化剂的局限性，如活性组分聚集和反应过程中的不稳定性。

然而，这种方法对其他催化应用的有效性还需要进一步研究和与其他合成技术进行比较。虽然通过电纺丝实现的结构特征通常对许多多相催化过程都有益，但其在不同催化应用中的相对有效性需要更全面的研究。
