The structural characteristics of B-based materials with 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks include:

1. One-dimensional porous nanofiber structure
2. Homogeneous distribution of Si, B, and O elements
3. High dispersion and stability of boron species on the open silica nanofiber framework
4. Immobilization of tri- and tetra-coordinated boron species via BOSi bridges

These features enhance catalytic performance by:

1. Providing easy diffusion and ensuring high catalytic activity at high WHSV
2. Offering uniform and stable catalyst structure
3. Maintaining catalytic stability even at high space velocity
4. Preventing aggregation of B2O3 and maintaining high dispersion of active sites

The method used to incorporate B active components into these structures is electrospinning. This method is highly effective for catalytic applications because:

1. It allows for one-step synthesis of porous boron-doped silica nanofiber catalysts
2. It ensures high dispersion and stability of boron species on the surface of the open silica nanofiber framework
3. It creates a uniform and stable catalyst structure that maintains its integrity during reactions
4. It results in stably immobilized boron species compared to supported catalysts

The electrospinning method appears to be particularly effective for oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) reactions of light alkanes, as evidenced by the higher olefin selectivity and catalytic stability shown by the PBSN catalysts in the ODH of ethane and propane. This method addresses limitations of traditional supported catalysts, such as aggregation of active components and instability during reactions.

2. 提供均匀和稳定的催化剂结构
3. 即使在高空速下也保持催化稳定性
4. 防止B2O3聚集并保持活性位点的高分散性

将B活性组分引入这些结构的方法是电纺丝。这种方法对催化应用非常有效，因为：

It ensures uniform dispersion and stability of boron species on the open silica nanofiber framework, which is particularly beneficial for oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) processes.

Compared to other methods like impregnation on various supports (e.g., TiO2, SiO2, Al2O3), electrospinning appears to be more effective in creating stable and highly dispersed boron species. This results in higher olefin selectivity and catalytic stability in the ODH of ethane and propane.

For ODH catalytic applications, the electrospinning method shows superior performance due to the stable immobilization of boron species and the maintenance of the porous structure during reactions. However, the effectiveness of this method for other catalytic applications would require further investigation, as the study primarily focused on ODH reactions.
