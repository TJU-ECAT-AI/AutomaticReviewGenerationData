[1] "Electrospinning was employed for the synthesis of one-dimensional porous boron-doped silica nanofiber (PBSN) catalysts in one step."

[2] "The results of the catalytic tests confirmed that the PBSN catalyst showed higher olefin selectivity and catalytic stability in the ODH of ethane and propane."

[3] "Electrospinning ensures high dispersion and stability of boron species on the surface of the open silica nanofiber framework in ODH processes."

[4] "The TEM image of PBSN-3 (Fig. 1(c)) shows a porous structure associated with a homogeneous distribution of Si, B, and O elements in the entire catalyst (Fig. 1(d))."

[5] "The N2 physical sorption isotherms of the PBSN catalysts (Fig. 2(a)) showed a type-IV shape, indicating their accessible mesoporous characteristics."

[6] "The XRD patterns of the PBSN catalysts in Fig. 2(c) show a broad reflection in the 2θ range of 15–29°, which is attributed to the amorphous nature of SiO2. B2O3 signals were not observed, suggesting that the B2O3 species may be highly dispersed in the fiber structure"

[7] "The 11B NMR analysis showed that the tri- and tetra-coordinated boron species were immobilized on the catalysts via B–O–Si bridges, which is consistent with the FTIR results."

The structural characteristics of B-based materials with 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks include:

1. One-dimensional porous nanofiber structure
2. Homogeneous distribution of Si, B, and O elements
3. Accessible mesoporous characteristics
4. Amorphous nature of SiO2 with highly dispersed B2O3 species
5. Tri- and tetra-coordinated boron species immobilized via B-O-Si bridges

These features enhance catalytic performance by:

1. Ensuring high dispersion and stability of boron species
2. Providing an open framework structure for easy diffusion
3. Offering high surface area for catalytic reactions
4. Maintaining stability of active sites during reactions

The method used to incorporate B active components into these structures is electrospinning. This one-step synthesis approach is highly effective for creating porous boron-doped silica nanofibers. The electrospinning method ensures:

1. Uniform dispersion of boron species
2. Stability of boron species on the silica nanofiber framework
3. Formation of a porous, one-dimensional structure

Compared to other methods like impregnation, electrospinning appears to be more effective in creating a stable, highly dispersed boron-based catalyst for oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) reactions. The resulting PBSN catalysts show higher olefin selectivity and catalytic stability in the ODH of ethane and propane compared to other supported boron oxide catalysts.

While this method has proven effective for ODH reactions, its relative effectiveness for other catalytic applications would need further investigation. However, the structural characteristics achieved through electrospinning, such as high dispersion, stability, and accessible porosity, are generally beneficial for many heterogeneous catalytic processes.

具有三维分散活性位点的B基材料在多孔框架中的结构特征包括：

1. 一维多孔纳米纤维结构
2. Si、B和O元素的均匀分布
3. 可接近的介孔特性
4. SiO2的无定形性质，B2O3物种高度分散
5. 通过B-O-Si桥键固定的三配位和四配位硼物种

这些特征通过以下方式增强催化性能：

1. 确保硼物种的高度分散和稳定性
2. 提供易于扩散的开放框架结构
3. 为催化反应提供高比表面积
4. 在反应过程中保持活性位点的稳定性

将B活性组分纳入这些结构的方法是静电纺丝。这种一步合成方法对于制造多孔硼掺杂二氧化硅纳米纤维非常有效。静电纺丝方法确保：

1. 硼物种的均匀分散
2. 硼物种在二氧化硅纳米纤维框架上的稳定性
3. 形成多孔的一维结构

与其他方法（如浸渍法）相比，静电纺丝在创造稳定、高度分散的硼基催化剂用于氧化脱氢（ODH）反应方面似乎更为有效。由此产生的PBSN催化剂在乙烷和丙烷的ODH反应中表现出更高的烯烃选择性和催化稳定性，优于其他负载型硼氧化物催化剂。

虽然这种方法在ODH反应中已证明是有效的，但对于其他催化应用的相对效果还需要进一步研究。然而，通过静电纺丝实现的结构特征，如高分散性、稳定性和可接近的孔隙度，通常对许多多相催化过程都有益。
