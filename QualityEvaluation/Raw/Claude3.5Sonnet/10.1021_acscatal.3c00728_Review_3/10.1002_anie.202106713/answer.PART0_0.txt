The literature does not directly discuss 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks for B-based materials. However, it does provide insights into how plasma treatment can modify the structure of hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) to enhance its catalytic performance in oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of propane.

The study focuses on using different plasma treatments (N2, O2, H2, and Ar) to modify the surface of h-BN and create defects that serve as active sites. These treatments break chemical bonds and react with surface atoms to form new bonds, effectively creating a more active catalyst surface.

N2 plasma treatment was found to be particularly effective in creating nitrogen defects, specifically three-boron center (TBC) defects, which were associated with improved catalytic performance. The N2-treated BN (N2-BN) showed the best catalytic activity, with 26.0% propane conversion and 89.4% olefins selectivity.

The effectiveness of the plasma treatment was evidenced by changes in the material's properties, such as a lower band gap for N2-BN (2.6 eV), indicating more defects. XPS analysis showed changes in the B 1s spectra, with peaks corresponding to B-N and B-O bonds, suggesting the creation of oxygen-containing boron species during treatment and reaction.

While this method doesn't create a 3-D porous framework, it demonstrates an effective way to modify 2-D h-BN sheets to incorporate more active boron sites. The plasma treatment approach offers a relatively simple and controllable method for creating defects and modifying the catalyst surface, which could potentially be applied to other B-based materials or extended to create more complex structures.

The study highlights the importance of creating specific types of defects (e.g., TBC nitrogen defects) rather than just increasing surface area or porosity. This suggests that for B-based catalysts, the local chemical environment around the boron sites is crucial for catalytic activity.

In conclusion, while the study doesn't directly address 3-D porous frameworks, it provides valuable insights into how surface modification and defect creation can enhance the catalytic performance of B-based materials, which could inform future design of more complex catalytic structures.

文献并未直接讨论B基材料中具有3-D分散活性位点的多孔框架结构。然而，它确实提供了关于如何使用等离子体处理来修饰六方氮化硼（h-BN）结构以提高其在丙烷氧化脱氢（ODH）反应中的催化性能的见解。

研究重点关注使用不同的等离子体处理（N2、O2、H2和Ar）来修饰h-BN表面并创造作为活性位点的缺陷。这些处理破坏化学键并与表面原子反应形成新的键，有效地创造了更活跃的催化剂表面。

N2等离子体处理被发现特别有效地创造氮缺陷，特别是三硼中心（TBC）缺陷，这与改善的催化性能有关。N2处理的BN（N2-BN）显示出最佳的催化活性，丙烷转化率为26.0%，烯烃选择性为89.4%。

等离子体处理的有效性通过材料性质的变化得到证实，例如N2-BN的较低带隙（2.6 eV），表明存在更多缺陷。XPS分析显示B 1s谱图发生变化，出现对应于B-N和B-O键的峰，表明在处理和反应过程中生成了含氧硼物种。

虽然这种方法并不创造3-D多孔框架，但它展示了一种有效修饰2-D h-BN片以引入更多活性硼位点的方法。等离子体处理方法提供了一种相对简单且可控的方法来创造缺陷和修饰催化剂表面，这可能适用于其他B基材料或扩展到创造更复杂的结构。

研究强调了创造特定类型缺陷（如TBC氮缺陷）的重要性，而不仅仅是增加表面积或孔隙率。这表明对于B基催化剂，硼位点周围的局部化学环境对催化活性至关重要。

总之，虽然该研究没有直接涉及3-D多孔框架，但它为表面修饰和缺陷创造如何提高B基材料的催化性能提供了宝贵的见解，这可能为未来设计更复杂的催化结构提供参考。
