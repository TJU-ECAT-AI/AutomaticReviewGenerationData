          "Recently, the discovery that hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) selectively oxidized propane to propylene with only negligible CO2 formation broke through the restriction of this process."

"Rational etching and chemical modifications on the surface of catalysts are critical for improving activity and understanding the reaction mechanism."

"High energy species (radicals, ions, and electrons) in plasma are capable of modifying surface property and composition of catalytic materials through breaking surface chemical bonds and reacting with surface atoms to form new chemical bonds."

"N2-BN exhibited a remarkable ODH reaction performance (26.0% propane conversion and 89.4% olefins selectivity)"

"The enhanced reactivity was closely related to the increased N-defects."

"Two types of N-defects (TBC and OBC) were generated during plasma treatment while TBC possibly preferred to become active BOx species under the ODH atmosphere and further converted propane to propylene."

"Spectroscopy demonstrated that three-boron center N-defects in the catalyst played a pivotal role in facilitating the conversion of propane."

"As an efficient up-to-down synthesis method, plasma technology not only provides a feasible way for the design of functionalized or defects-rich catalysts but also deepens the comprehension of active sites."

          The literature does not directly discuss 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks for B-based materials. Instead, it focuses on enhancing the catalytic performance of hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) through surface modifications using plasma treatment. 

Key structural characteristics and methods for incorporating B active components include:

1. Surface Modification: Plasma treatment is used to modify the surface properties and composition of h-BN catalysts. This creates defects and introduces new chemical bonds, enhancing catalytic activity.

2. N-defects Creation: N2 plasma treatment is particularly effective in creating N-defects, especially three-boron center (TBC) defects. These defects serve as favorable sites for generating active species during the oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of propane.

3. Plasma Treatment Variations: Different plasma treatments (N2, O2, H2, and Ar) were evaluated. N2-treated BN showed the best performance with 26.0% propane conversion and 89.4% olefins selectivity.

4. Active Site Formation: TBC defects are believed to evolve into active BOx species under ODH reaction conditions, facilitating the conversion of propane to propylene.

5. Controlled Modification: Plasma technology allows for controlled modification of the catalyst surface, crucial for improving activity and understanding reaction mechanisms.

This approach enhances catalytic performance by creating specific defects and tailoring the local chemical environment of B-based catalysts. While not addressing 3-D porous frameworks directly, it demonstrates an effective method for creating active sites in B-based materials, potentially applicable to more complex structures.

The effectiveness of this method varies depending on the specific catalytic application, with the study focusing primarily on the ODH of propane. Further research would be needed to determine its applicability to other reactions or more complex B-based catalyst structures.

          文献并未直接讨论B基材料中具有三维分散活性位点的多孔框架结构。相反，它侧重于通过使用等离子体处理进行表面修饰来提高六方氮化硼（h-BN）的催化性能。

关键的结构特征和引入B活性组分的方法包括：

1. 表面修饰：利用等离子体处理来修改h-BN催化剂的表面性质和组成。这创造了缺陷并引入了新的化学键，从而增强催化活性。

2. N缺陷创造：N2等离子体处理特别有效地创造N缺陷，尤其是三硼中心（TBC）缺陷。这些缺陷在丙烷氧化脱氢（ODH）反应中作为生成活性物种的有利位点。

3. 等离子体处理变化：评估了不同的等离子体处理（N2、O2、H2和Ar）。N2处理的BN表现最佳，丙烷转化率为26.0%，烯烃选择性为89.4%。

4. 活性位点形成：TBC缺陷被认为在ODH反应条件下演变为活性BOx物种，促进丙烷向丙烯的转化。

5. 可控修饰：等离子体技术允许对催化剂表面进行可控修饰，这对提高活性和理解反应机理至关重要。

这种方法通过创造特定缺陷和调整B基催化剂的局部化学环境来提高催化性能。虽然没有直接涉及三维多孔框架，但它展示了一种在B基材料中创造活性位点的有效方法，可能适用于更复杂的结构。

该方法的有效性因特定的催化应用而异，该研究主要集中在丙烷的ODH反应上。需要进一步研究以确定其对其他反应或更复杂的B基催化剂结构的适用性。
