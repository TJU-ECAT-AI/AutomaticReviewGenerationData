The literature does not directly discuss 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks for B-based materials. However, it does provide insights into how plasma treatment can modify the structure of hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) to enhance its catalytic performance in oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of propane.

The study focuses on using different plasma treatments (N2, O2, H2, and Ar) to modify the surface of h-BN and create defects that serve as active sites. These treatments break chemical bonds and react with surface atoms to form new bonds, effectively creating a more active catalyst surface.

N2 plasma treatment was found to be particularly effective in creating nitrogen defects, specifically three-boron center (TBC) defects, which were associated with improved catalytic performance. The N2-treated BN (N2-BN) showed the best catalytic activity, with 26.0% propane conversion and 89.4% olefins selectivity.

The effectiveness of the plasma treatment was evidenced by changes in the material's properties, such as a lower band gap for N2-BN (2.6 eV), indicating more defects. XPS analysis showed changes in the B 1s spectra, with peaks corresponding to B-N and B-O bonds, suggesting the creation of oxygen-containing boron species during treatment and reaction.

While this method doesn't create a 3-D porous framework, it demonstrates an effective way to modify 2-D h-BN sheets to incorporate more active boron sites. The plasma treatment approach offers a relatively simple and controllable method for creating defects and modifying the catalyst surface, which could potentially be applied to other B-based materials or extended to create more complex structures.

The study highlights the importance of creating specific types of defects (e.g., TBC nitrogen defects) rather than just increasing surface area or porosity. This suggests that for B-based catalysts, the local chemical environment around the boron sites is crucial for catalytic activity.

In conclusion, while the study doesn't directly address 3-D porous frameworks, it provides valuable insights into how surface modification and defect creation can enhance the catalytic performance of B-based materials, which could inform future design of more complex catalytic structures.

文献并未直接讨论B基材料中具有3-D分散活性位点的多孔框架结构。然而，它确实提供了关于如何使用等离子体处理来修饰六方氮化硼（h-BN）结构以提高其在丙烷氧化脱氢（ODH）反应中的催化性能的见解。

研究重点关注使用不同的等离子体处理（N2、O2、H2和Ar）来修饰h-BN表面并创造作为活性位点的缺陷。这些处理破坏化学键并与表面原子反应形成新的键，有效地创造了更活跃的催化剂表面。

N2等离子体处理被发现特别有效地创造氮缺陷，特别是三硼中心（TBC）缺陷，这与改善的催化性能有关。N2处理的BN（N2-BN）显示出最佳的催化活性，丙烷转化率为26.0%，烯烃选择性为89.4%。

等离子体处理的有效性通过材料性质的变化得到证实，例如N2-BN的较低带隙（2.6 eV），表明存在更多缺陷。XPS分析显示B 1s谱图发生变化，出现对应于B-N和B-O键的峰，表明在处理和反应过程中生成了含氧硼物种。

虽然这种方法并不创造3-D多孔框架，但它展示了一种有效修饰2-D h-BN片以引入更多活性硼位点的方法。等离子体处理方法提供了一种相对简单且可控的方法来创造缺陷和修饰催化剂表面，这可能适用于其他B基材料或扩展到创造更复杂的结构。

研究强调了创造特定类型缺陷（如TBC氮缺陷）的重要性，而不仅仅是增加表面积或孔隙率。这表明对于B基催化剂，硼位点周围的局部化学环境对催化活性至关重要。

总之，虽然该研究没有直接涉及3-D多孔框架，但它为表面修饰和缺陷创造如何提高B基材料的催化性能提供了宝贵的见解，这可能为未来设计更复杂的催化结构提供参考。

The literature does not specifically discuss 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks for B-based materials. However, it does provide insights into enhancing catalytic performance of B-based materials through surface modifications:

1. Plasma treatment is used to modify the surface properties and composition of boron nitride (BN) catalysts. This method can create defects and introduce new chemical bonds, potentially enhancing catalytic activity.

2. Different plasma treatments (N2, O2, H2, Ar) were employed to regulate the local chemical environment of BN. Among these, N2-plasma treatment showed the best results for the oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of propane.

3. N2-plasma treatment created more N-defects on the BN surface, particularly three-boron center (TBC) defects. These defects were found to be favorable sites for generating active species during the ODH reaction.

4. The incorporation of oxygen-containing boron species (BOx) on the catalyst surface during the reaction was observed to enhance catalytic activity. However, excessive BOx formation (as in O2-plasma treated BN) led to sintering and reduced performance.

5. The effectiveness of plasma treatment varied depending on the gas used. N2-plasma was most effective for ODH of propane, while O2-plasma had negative effects due to sintering. H2-plasma introduced N-H and B-H bonds but did not significantly improve catalytic performance.

While this study focuses on surface modification rather than 3-D porous frameworks, it demonstrates the importance of tailoring the local chemical environment of B-based catalysts to enhance their performance in specific applications.

虽然文献并未具体讨论B基材料在多孔框架中的3-D分散活性位点，但它确实提供了通过表面修饰来增强B基材料催化性能的见解：

1. 等离子体处理被用于修改氮化硼（BN）催化剂的表面性质和组成。这种方法可以创造缺陷并引入新的化学键，从而可能增强催化活性。

2. 使用了不同的等离子体处理（N2、O2、H2、Ar）来调节BN的局部化学环境。其中，N2等离子体处理在丙烷的氧化脱氢（ODH）反应中表现最佳。

3. N2等离子体处理在BN表面创造了更多的N缺陷，特别是三硼中心（TBC）缺陷。这些缺陷被发现是ODH反应中产生活性物种的有利位点。

4. 在反应过程中，催化剂表面含氧硼物种（BOx）的形成被观察到可以增强催化活性。然而，过多的BOx形成（如在O2等离子体处理的BN中）会导致烧结和性能降低。

5. 等离子体处理的效果因所使用的气体而异。N2等离子体对丙烷的ODH最有效，而O2等离子体由于烧结作用而产生负面影响。H2等离子体引入了N-H和B-H键，但并未显著改善催化性能。

虽然这项研究侧重于表面修饰而非3-D多孔框架，但它展示了调整B基催化剂局部化学环境对于增强其在特定应用中的性能的重要性。

The literature primarily focuses on hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) catalysts modified by plasma treatment, rather than 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks. However, some insights can be drawn from the study:

1. Structural characteristics: The h-BN catalysts have a 2D sheet-like structure with active sites primarily on the surface. Plasma treatment creates N-defects, particularly three-boron center (TBC) defects, which enhance catalytic performance.

2. Enhancement of catalytic performance: The creation of N-defects, especially TBC defects, improves the catalytic activity of h-BN. These defects serve as precursors for active BOx species formation during the oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) reaction, leading to higher propane conversion and olefin selectivity.

3. Methods for incorporating B active components: The study uses plasma treatment (N2, O2, H2, and Ar) to modify the h-BN structure and create active sites. This method proves effective in selectively constructing boron sites with different local environments.

4. Effectiveness for catalytic applications: N2 plasma treatment was found to be the most effective for the ODH of propane, achieving 26.0% propane conversion with 89.4% selectivity toward olefins at 520°C. O2 plasma treatment, while creating oxygen-containing boron species, led to sintering and reduced catalytic performance.

While the study does not directly address 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks, it demonstrates the importance of creating and controlling defects in B-based materials to enhance catalytic performance. The plasma treatment method offers a promising approach for modifying catalyst surfaces and creating active sites, which could potentially be applied to other B-based materials with different structures.

这篇文献主要关注通过等离子体处理修饰的六方氮化硼（h-BN）催化剂，而非多孔框架中的三维分散活性位点。然而，我们可以从这项研究中得到一些见解：

1. 结构特征：h-BN催化剂具有二维片状结构，活性位点主要分布在表面。等离子体处理会创造N缺陷，特别是三硼中心（TBC）缺陷，这些缺陷能够提高催化性能。

2. 催化性能的提升：N缺陷的创造，尤其是TBC缺陷，提高了h-BN的催化活性。这些缺陷在氧化脱氢（ODH）反应过程中作为活性BOx物种形成的前体，从而提高了丙烷转化率和烯烃选择性。

3. 引入B活性组分的方法：研究使用等离子体处理（N2、O2、H2和Ar）来修饰h-BN结构并创造活性位点。这种方法在选择性构建具有不同局部环境的硼位点方面证明是有效的。

4. 对催化应用的有效性：N2等离子体处理被发现对丙烷的ODH最有效，在520°C下实现了26.0%的丙烷转化率和89.4%的烯烃选择性。O2等离子体处理虽然创造了含氧硼物种，但导致烧结和催化性能下降。

虽然这项研究没有直接涉及多孔框架中的三维分散活性位点，但它证明了在B基材料中创造和控制缺陷对提高催化性能的重要性。等离子体处理方法为修饰催化剂表面和创造活性位点提供了一种有前景的方法，这可能适用于具有不同结构的其他B基材料。

[1] "N2-treated BN exhibited a remarkable activity, i.e., 26.0% propane conversion with 89.4% selectivity toward olefins at 520C."

[2] "Spectroscopy demonstrated that three-boron center N-defects in the catalyst played a pivotal role in facilitating the conversion of propane."

[3] "Although the B/N ratio slightly increased from 1.28 of BN to 1.29 of H2-BN and Ar-BN (TableS4), the low activity of H2-BN may be attributed to the suppression of B-H species, and the unchanged activity of Ar-BN may result from the compromised effect between the increased B/N ratio and decreased specific surface area."

[4] "The above results suggested the enhanced reactivity was closely related to the increased N-defects."

The literature does not directly discuss 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks for B-based materials. However, it does provide insights into the structural characteristics and incorporation of B active components that enhance catalytic performance in hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) materials.

The study focuses on using plasma treatment to modify the surface of h-BN and create N-defects, which serve as active sites for the oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of propane. The most effective treatment was N2 plasma, which created three-boron center (TBC) N-defects. These defects played a crucial role in improving catalytic activity, resulting in 26.0% propane conversion with 89.4% selectivity toward olefins.

The method of incorporating B active components involves using different types of plasma (N2, O2, H2, and Ar) to treat ball-milled BN. This approach creates various types of defects and modifies the local chemical environment of h-BN. The effectiveness of this method varies depending on the type of plasma used:

1. N2 plasma: Most effective, creating TBC N-defects that enhance catalytic performance.
2. O2 plasma: Less effective due to the formation of BOx species that cause sintering and reduce activity.
3. H2 plasma: Generates B-H species that suppress catalytic activity.
4. Ar plasma: Shows minimal changes in activity due to the balance between increased B/N ratio and decreased surface area.

The study demonstrates that the enhanced reactivity is closely related to the increased N-defects, particularly the TBC defects. These defects are thought to evolve into active BOx species under ODH reaction conditions, which then facilitate the conversion of propane to propylene.

While this method is effective for creating active sites in h-BN for ODH reactions, its applicability to other catalytic applications may vary. The study focuses specifically on propane dehydrogenation, so the effectiveness of this approach for other reactions would require further investigation.

In conclusion, although the study does not directly address 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks, it provides valuable insights into creating and incorporating B active components in h-BN materials through plasma treatment. This method proves effective for enhancing catalytic performance in the ODH of propane, with N2 plasma treatment showing the most promising results.

该文献并未直接讨论多孔框架中具有三维分散活性位点的B基材料。然而，它确实提供了关于六方氮化硼（h-BN）材料中结构特征和B活性组分incorporation的见解，这些特征和组分能够提高催化性能。

研究重点是使用等离子体处理来修饰h-BN的表面并创造N缺陷，这些缺陷作为丙烷氧化脱氢（ODH）反应的活性位点。最有效的处理方法是N2等离子体，它创造了三硼中心（TBC）N缺陷。这些缺陷在提高催化活性方面起着关键作用，使丙烷转化率达到26.0%，烯烃选择性达到89.4%。

incorporation B活性组分的方法涉及使用不同类型的等离子体（N2、O2、H2和Ar）处理球磨BN。这种方法创造了各种类型的缺陷并修饰了h-BN的局部化学环境。该方法的有效性因所使用的等离子体类型而异：

1. N2等离子体：最有效，创造TBC N缺陷，提高催化性能。
2. O2等离子体：由于形成BOx物种导致烧结和降低活性，效果较差。
3. H2等离子体：生成抑制催化活性的B-H物种。
4. Ar等离子体：由于B/N比例增加和比表面积减少之间的平衡，活性变化很小。

研究表明，提高的反应活性与N缺陷的增加密切相关，特别是TBC缺陷。这些缺陷被认为在ODH反应条件下演变成活性BOx物种，然后促进丙烷转化为丙烯。

虽然这种方法对于在h-BN中创造ODH反应的活性位点是有效的，但其对其他催化应用的适用性可能会有所不同。该研究主要集中在丙烷脱氢反应上，因此这种方法对其他反应的有效性需要进一步研究。

总之，尽管该研究没有直接涉及多孔框架中的三维分散活性位点，但它为通过等离子体处理在h-BN材料中创造和incorporation B活性组分提供了宝贵的见解。这种方法在丙烷的ODH反应中证明能有效提高催化性能，其中N2等离子体处理显示出最有前景的结果。

The literature does not directly discuss 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks for B-based materials. However, it does provide insights into enhancing catalytic performance through surface modifications of hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) using plasma treatment.

The study demonstrates that plasma treatment can effectively modify the surface properties and composition of h-BN catalysts. This method creates defects and introduces new chemical bonds, which can enhance catalytic activity. Specifically, N2 plasma treatment was found to create more three-boron center N-defects, which were favorable for generating active sites and improving catalytic performance in the oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of propane.

The effectiveness of different plasma treatments (N2, O2, H2, and Ar) was evaluated. N2-treated BN showed the best performance, with 26.0% propane conversion and 89.4% olefins selectivity. In contrast, O2-treated BN exhibited lower activity due to sintering effects.

While this study focuses on surface modifications rather than 3-D porous frameworks, it demonstrates the potential of plasma technology as an efficient top-down synthesis method for creating functionalized or defect-rich catalysts. This approach allows for controlled modification of the catalyst surface, which is crucial for improving activity and understanding reaction mechanisms.

The study highlights the importance of rational etching and chemical modifications in catalyst design. By selectively creating defects and introducing specific chemical bonds, researchers can tailor the catalytic properties of materials like h-BN for specific applications, such as the ODH of propane.

In conclusion, while the literature does not directly address 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks, it provides valuable insights into enhancing catalytic performance through surface modifications. The plasma treatment method described offers a promising approach for creating active sites and improving catalytic activity in B-based materials.

该文献并未直接讨论多孔框架中具有三维分散活性位点的B基材料。然而，它确实提供了通过等离子体处理对六方氮化硼（h-BN）进行表面改性来提高催化性能的见解。

研究表明，等离子体处理可以有效地改变h-BN催化剂的表面性质和组成。这种方法可以创造缺陷并引入新的化学键，从而提高催化活性。具体来说，N2等离子体处理被发现可以创造更多的三硼中心N缺陷，这有利于生成活性位点并提高丙烷氧化脱氢（ODH）的催化性能。

研究评估了不同等离子体处理（N2、O2、H2和Ar）的效果。N2处理的BN表现最佳，丙烷转化率为26.0%，烯烃选择性为89.4%。相比之下，O2处理的BN由于烧结效应而表现出较低的活性。

虽然这项研究侧重于表面改性而非三维多孔框架，但它展示了等离子体技术作为一种高效的自上而下合成方法在创造功能化或缺陷丰富的催化剂方面的潜力。这种方法允许对催化剂表面进行可控修饰，这对于提高活性和理解反应机理至关重要。

研究强调了催化剂设计中理性蚀刻和化学改性的重要性。通过选择性地创造缺陷和引入特定的化学键，研究人员可以针对特定应用（如丙烷的ODH）调整h-BN等材料的催化性能。

总之，虽然文献没有直接讨论多孔框架中的三维分散活性位点，但它为通过表面改性提高催化性能提供了宝贵的见解。所描述的等离子体处理方法为在B基材料中创造活性位点和提高催化活性提供了一种有前景的方法。
