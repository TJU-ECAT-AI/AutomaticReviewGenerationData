The literature does not specifically discuss 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks for B-based materials. However, it does provide insights into enhancing catalytic performance of B-based materials through surface modifications:

1. Plasma treatment is used to modify the surface properties and composition of boron nitride (BN) catalysts. This method can create defects and introduce new chemical bonds, potentially enhancing catalytic activity.

2. Different plasma treatments (N2, O2, H2, Ar) were employed to regulate the local chemical environment of BN. Among these, N2-plasma treatment showed the best results for the oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of propane.

3. N2-plasma treatment created more N-defects on the BN surface, particularly three-boron center (TBC) defects. These defects were found to be favorable sites for generating active species during the ODH reaction.

4. The incorporation of oxygen-containing boron species (BOx) on the catalyst surface during the reaction was observed to enhance catalytic activity. However, excessive BOx formation (as in O2-plasma treated BN) led to sintering and reduced performance.

5. The effectiveness of plasma treatment varied depending on the gas used. N2-plasma was most effective for ODH of propane, while O2-plasma had negative effects due to sintering. H2-plasma introduced N-H and B-H bonds but did not significantly improve catalytic performance.

While this study focuses on surface modification rather than 3-D porous frameworks, it demonstrates the importance of tailoring the local chemical environment of B-based catalysts to enhance their performance in specific applications.

虽然文献并未具体讨论B基材料在多孔框架中的3-D分散活性位点，但它确实提供了通过表面修饰来增强B基材料催化性能的见解：

1. 等离子体处理被用于修改氮化硼（BN）催化剂的表面性质和组成。这种方法可以创造缺陷并引入新的化学键，从而可能增强催化活性。

2. 使用了不同的等离子体处理（N2、O2、H2、Ar）来调节BN的局部化学环境。其中，N2等离子体处理在丙烷的氧化脱氢（ODH）反应中表现最佳。

3. N2等离子体处理在BN表面创造了更多的N缺陷，特别是三硼中心（TBC）缺陷。这些缺陷被发现是ODH反应中产生活性物种的有利位点。

4. 在反应过程中，催化剂表面含氧硼物种（BOx）的形成被观察到可以增强催化活性。然而，过多的BOx形成（如在O2等离子体处理的BN中）会导致烧结和性能降低。

5. 等离子体处理的效果因所使用的气体而异。N2等离子体对丙烷的ODH最有效，而O2等离子体由于烧结作用而产生负面影响。H2等离子体引入了N-H和B-H键，但并未显著改善催化性能。

虽然这项研究侧重于表面修饰而非3-D多孔框架，但它展示了调整B基催化剂局部化学环境对于增强其在特定应用中的性能的重要性。
