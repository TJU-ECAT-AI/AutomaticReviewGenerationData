The literature primarily focuses on hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) catalysts modified by plasma treatment, rather than 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks. However, some insights can be drawn from the study:

1. Structural characteristics: The h-BN catalysts have a 2D sheet-like structure with active sites primarily on the surface. Plasma treatment creates N-defects, particularly three-boron center (TBC) defects, which enhance catalytic performance.

2. Enhancement of catalytic performance: The creation of N-defects, especially TBC defects, improves the catalytic activity of h-BN. These defects serve as precursors for active BOx species formation during the oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) reaction, leading to higher propane conversion and olefin selectivity.

3. Methods for incorporating B active components: The study uses plasma treatment (N2, O2, H2, and Ar) to modify the h-BN structure and create active sites. This method proves effective in selectively constructing boron sites with different local environments.

4. Effectiveness for catalytic applications: N2 plasma treatment was found to be the most effective for the ODH of propane, achieving 26.0% propane conversion with 89.4% selectivity toward olefins at 520°C. O2 plasma treatment, while creating oxygen-containing boron species, led to sintering and reduced catalytic performance.

While the study does not directly address 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks, it demonstrates the importance of creating and controlling defects in B-based materials to enhance catalytic performance. The plasma treatment method offers a promising approach for modifying catalyst surfaces and creating active sites, which could potentially be applied to other B-based materials with different structures.

这篇文献主要关注通过等离子体处理修饰的六方氮化硼（h-BN）催化剂，而非多孔框架中的三维分散活性位点。然而，我们可以从这项研究中得到一些见解：

1. 结构特征：h-BN催化剂具有二维片状结构，活性位点主要分布在表面。等离子体处理会创造N缺陷，特别是三硼中心（TBC）缺陷，这些缺陷能够提高催化性能。

2. 催化性能的提升：N缺陷的创造，尤其是TBC缺陷，提高了h-BN的催化活性。这些缺陷在氧化脱氢（ODH）反应过程中作为活性BOx物种形成的前体，从而提高了丙烷转化率和烯烃选择性。

3. 引入B活性组分的方法：研究使用等离子体处理（N2、O2、H2和Ar）来修饰h-BN结构并创造活性位点。这种方法在选择性构建具有不同局部环境的硼位点方面证明是有效的。

4. 对催化应用的有效性：N2等离子体处理被发现对丙烷的ODH最有效，在520°C下实现了26.0%的丙烷转化率和89.4%的烯烃选择性。O2等离子体处理虽然创造了含氧硼物种，但导致烧结和催化性能下降。

虽然这项研究没有直接涉及多孔框架中的三维分散活性位点，但它证明了在B基材料中创造和控制缺陷对提高催化性能的重要性。等离子体处理方法为修饰催化剂表面和创造活性位点提供了一种有前景的方法，这可能适用于具有不同结构的其他B基材料。
