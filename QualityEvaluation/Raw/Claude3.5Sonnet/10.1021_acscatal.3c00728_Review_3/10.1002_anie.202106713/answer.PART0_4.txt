The literature does not directly discuss 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks for B-based materials. However, it does provide insights into enhancing catalytic performance through surface modifications of hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) using plasma treatment.

The study demonstrates that plasma treatment can effectively modify the surface properties and composition of h-BN catalysts. This method creates defects and introduces new chemical bonds, which can enhance catalytic activity. Specifically, N2 plasma treatment was found to create more three-boron center N-defects, which were favorable for generating active sites and improving catalytic performance in the oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of propane.

The effectiveness of different plasma treatments (N2, O2, H2, and Ar) was evaluated. N2-treated BN showed the best performance, with 26.0% propane conversion and 89.4% olefins selectivity. In contrast, O2-treated BN exhibited lower activity due to sintering effects.

While this study focuses on surface modifications rather than 3-D porous frameworks, it demonstrates the potential of plasma technology as an efficient top-down synthesis method for creating functionalized or defect-rich catalysts. This approach allows for controlled modification of the catalyst surface, which is crucial for improving activity and understanding reaction mechanisms.

The study highlights the importance of rational etching and chemical modifications in catalyst design. By selectively creating defects and introducing specific chemical bonds, researchers can tailor the catalytic properties of materials like h-BN for specific applications, such as the ODH of propane.

In conclusion, while the literature does not directly address 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks, it provides valuable insights into enhancing catalytic performance through surface modifications. The plasma treatment method described offers a promising approach for creating active sites and improving catalytic activity in B-based materials.

该文献并未直接讨论多孔框架中具有三维分散活性位点的B基材料。然而，它确实提供了通过等离子体处理对六方氮化硼（h-BN）进行表面改性来提高催化性能的见解。

研究表明，等离子体处理可以有效地改变h-BN催化剂的表面性质和组成。这种方法可以创造缺陷并引入新的化学键，从而提高催化活性。具体来说，N2等离子体处理被发现可以创造更多的三硼中心N缺陷，这有利于生成活性位点并提高丙烷氧化脱氢（ODH）的催化性能。

研究评估了不同等离子体处理（N2、O2、H2和Ar）的效果。N2处理的BN表现最佳，丙烷转化率为26.0%，烯烃选择性为89.4%。相比之下，O2处理的BN由于烧结效应而表现出较低的活性。

虽然这项研究侧重于表面改性而非三维多孔框架，但它展示了等离子体技术作为一种高效的自上而下合成方法在创造功能化或缺陷丰富的催化剂方面的潜力。这种方法允许对催化剂表面进行可控修饰，这对于提高活性和理解反应机理至关重要。

研究强调了催化剂设计中理性蚀刻和化学改性的重要性。通过选择性地创造缺陷和引入特定的化学键，研究人员可以针对特定应用（如丙烷的ODH）调整h-BN等材料的催化性能。

总之，虽然文献没有直接讨论多孔框架中的三维分散活性位点，但它为通过表面改性提高催化性能提供了宝贵的见解。所描述的等离子体处理方法为在B基材料中创造活性位点和提高催化活性提供了一种有前景的方法。
