[1] "N2-treated BN exhibited a remarkable activity, i.e., 26.0% propane conversion with 89.4% selectivity toward olefins at 520C."

[2] "Spectroscopy demonstrated that three-boron center N-defects in the catalyst played a pivotal role in facilitating the conversion of propane."

[3] "Although the B/N ratio slightly increased from 1.28 of BN to 1.29 of H2-BN and Ar-BN (TableS4), the low activity of H2-BN may be attributed to the suppression of B-H species, and the unchanged activity of Ar-BN may result from the compromised effect between the increased B/N ratio and decreased specific surface area."

[4] "The above results suggested the enhanced reactivity was closely related to the increased N-defects."

[5] "Two types of N-defects (TBC and OBC) were generated during plasma treatment while TBC possibly preferred to become active BOx species under the ODH atmosphere and further converted propane to propylene."

The literature does not directly discuss 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks for B-based materials. However, it does provide insights into the structural characteristics and incorporation of B active components that enhance catalytic performance in hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) materials.

The study focuses on using plasma treatment to modify the surface of h-BN and create N-defects, which serve as active sites for the oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of propane. The most effective treatment was N2 plasma, which created three-boron center (TBC) N-defects. These defects played a crucial role in improving catalytic activity, resulting in 26.0% propane conversion with 89.4% selectivity toward olefins.

The method of incorporating B active components involves using different types of plasma (N2, O2, H2, and Ar) to treat ball-milled BN. This approach creates various types of defects and modifies the local chemical environment of h-BN. The effectiveness of this method varies depending on the type of plasma used:

1. N2 plasma: Most effective, creating TBC N-defects that enhance catalytic performance.
2. O2 plasma: Less effective due to the formation of BOx species that cause sintering and reduce activity.
3. H2 plasma: Generates B-H species that suppress catalytic activity.
4. Ar plasma: Shows minimal changes in activity due to the balance between increased B/N ratio and decreased surface area.

The study demonstrates that the enhanced reactivity is closely related to the increased N-defects, particularly the TBC defects. These defects are thought to evolve into active BOx species under ODH reaction conditions, which then facilitate the conversion of propane to propylene.

While this method is effective for creating active sites in h-BN for ODH reactions, its applicability to other catalytic applications may vary. The study focuses specifically on propane dehydrogenation, so the effectiveness of this approach for other reactions would require further investigation.

In conclusion, although the study does not directly address 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks, it provides valuable insights into creating and incorporating B active components in h-BN materials through plasma treatment. This method proves effective for enhancing catalytic performance in the ODH of propane, with N2 plasma treatment showing the most promising results.

该文献并未直接讨论多孔框架中具有三维分散活性位点的B基材料。然而，它确实提供了关于六方氮化硼（h-BN）材料中结构特征和B活性组分incorporation的见解，这些特征和组分能够提高催化性能。

研究重点是使用等离子体处理来修饰h-BN的表面并创造N缺陷，这些缺陷作为丙烷氧化脱氢（ODH）反应的活性位点。最有效的处理方法是N2等离子体，它创造了三硼中心（TBC）N缺陷。这些缺陷在提高催化活性方面起着关键作用，使丙烷转化率达到26.0%，烯烃选择性达到89.4%。

incorporation B活性组分的方法涉及使用不同类型的等离子体（N2、O2、H2和Ar）处理球磨BN。这种方法创造了各种类型的缺陷并修饰了h-BN的局部化学环境。该方法的有效性因所使用的等离子体类型而异：

1. N2等离子体：最有效，创造TBC N缺陷，提高催化性能。
2. O2等离子体：由于形成BOx物种导致烧结和降低活性，效果较差。
3. H2等离子体：生成抑制催化活性的B-H物种。
4. Ar等离子体：由于B/N比例增加和比表面积减少之间的平衡，活性变化很小。

研究表明，提高的反应活性与N缺陷的增加密切相关，特别是TBC缺陷。这些缺陷被认为在ODH反应条件下演变成活性BOx物种，然后促进丙烷转化为丙烯。

虽然这种方法对于在h-BN中创造ODH反应的活性位点是有效的，但其对其他催化应用的适用性可能会有所不同。该研究主要集中在丙烷脱氢反应上，因此这种方法对其他反应的有效性需要进一步研究。

总之，尽管该研究没有直接涉及多孔框架中的三维分散活性位点，但它为通过等离子体处理在h-BN材料中创造和incorporation B活性组分提供了宝贵的见解。这种方法在丙烷的ODH反应中证明能有效提高催化性能，其中N2等离子体处理显示出最有前景的结果。
