B-based materials with 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks have garnered significant attention in the field of catalysis due to their unique structural characteristics and catalytic advantages. These materials typically feature a highly interconnected network of pores and channels, providing a large surface area and improved mass transport properties. The incorporation of boron atoms throughout the framework creates a multitude of active sites dispersed in three dimensions, enhancing catalytic activity and selectivity. Various methods can be employed to synthesize these materials, including templating techniques, hydrothermal synthesis, and post-synthetic modification. The resulting structures often exhibit improved thermal and chemical stability compared to their 2-D counterparts. The 3-D distribution of active sites allows for more efficient utilization of the catalyst, reducing the likelihood of site blockage and deactivation. These materials have shown promise in a wide range of catalytic applications, including oxidation reactions, acid-catalyzed processes, and fine chemical synthesis, offering improved performance and recyclability compared to traditional catalysts.
