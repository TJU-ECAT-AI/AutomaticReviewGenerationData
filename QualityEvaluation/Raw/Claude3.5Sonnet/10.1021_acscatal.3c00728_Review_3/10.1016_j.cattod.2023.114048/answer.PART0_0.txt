The literature does not provide sufficient information to fully analyze the structural characteristics of B-based materials with 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks or critically evaluate the methods used to incorporate B active components into these structures. However, some relevant insights can be drawn from the available information:

The study focuses on boron oxide supported on silica with different pore structures, which suggests a 3-D dispersed active site configuration. The impact of spatial confinement on the performance and kinetics of these materials was investigated, indicating that the porous framework plays a crucial role in catalytic performance.

The research found that the formation rate of propylene decreases with increasing confinement of active boron sites. This suggests that the structural characteristics of the porous framework, particularly the degree of confinement, can significantly influence catalytic performance.

The apparent propane reaction order varies from 1 to 3, affected by the pore structure of supports, B2O3 loading, and propane partial pressure. This variability indicates that the structural characteristics of the support and the distribution of boron active sites within the porous framework have a substantial impact on the reaction kinetics.

The study does not provide detailed information on the methods used to incorporate B active components into the structures or their relative effectiveness for different catalytic applications. However, it is clear that the interaction between the boron oxide and the silica support, as well as the pore structure of the support, plays a crucial role in determining the catalytic performance in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane.

文献没有提供足够的信息来全面分析具有3-D分散活性位点的B基材料在多孔框架中的结构特征，或批判性地评估将B活性组分纳入这些结构的方法。但是，从可用信息中可以得出一些相关见解：

研究重点关注了在具有不同孔结构的二氧化硅上负载的三氧化二硼，这表明存在3-D分散的活性位点配置。研究了空间限制对这些材料性能和动力学的影响，表明多孔框架在催化性能中起着关键作用。

研究发现，随着活性硼位点限制程度的增加，丙烯的生成速率降低。这表明多孔框架的结构特征，特别是限制程度，可以显著影响催化性能。

表观丙烷反应级数从1到3不等，受载体的孔结构、B2O3负载量和丙烷分压的影响。这种可变性表明，载体的结构特征和硼活性位点在多孔框架中的分布对反应动力学有实质性影响。

该研究没有提供将B活性组分纳入结构的详细方法，或它们对不同催化应用的相对有效性。然而，很明显，三氧化二硼与二氧化硅载体之间的相互作用，以及载体的孔结构，在决定丙烷氧化脱氢的催化性能中起着关键作用。
