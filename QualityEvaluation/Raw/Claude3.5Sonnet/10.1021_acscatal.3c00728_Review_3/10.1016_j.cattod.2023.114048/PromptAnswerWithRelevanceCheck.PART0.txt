The literature does not provide sufficient information to fully analyze the structural characteristics of B-based materials with 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks or critically evaluate the methods used to incorporate B active components into these structures. However, some relevant insights can be drawn from the available information:

The study focuses on boron oxide supported on silica with different pore structures, which suggests a 3-D dispersed active site configuration. The impact of spatial confinement on the performance and kinetics of these materials was investigated, indicating that the porous framework plays a crucial role in catalytic performance.

The research found that the formation rate of propylene decreases with increasing confinement of active boron sites. This suggests that the structural characteristics of the porous framework, particularly the degree of confinement, can significantly influence catalytic performance.

The apparent propane reaction order varies from 1 to 3, affected by the pore structure of supports, B2O3 loading, and propane partial pressure. This variability indicates that the structural characteristics of the support and the distribution of boron active sites within the porous framework have a substantial impact on the reaction kinetics.

The study does not provide detailed information on the methods used to incorporate B active components into the structures or their relative effectiveness for different catalytic applications. However, it is clear that the interaction between the boron oxide and the silica support, as well as the pore structure of the support, plays a crucial role in determining the catalytic performance in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane.

文献没有提供足够的信息来全面分析具有3-D分散活性位点的B基材料在多孔框架中的结构特征，或批判性地评估将B活性组分纳入这些结构的方法。但是，从可用信息中可以得出一些相关见解：

研究重点关注了在具有不同孔结构的二氧化硅上负载的三氧化二硼，这表明存在3-D分散的活性位点配置。研究了空间限制对这些材料性能和动力学的影响，表明多孔框架在催化性能中起着关键作用。

研究发现，随着活性硼位点限制程度的增加，丙烯的生成速率降低。这表明多孔框架的结构特征，特别是限制程度，可以显著影响催化性能。

表观丙烷反应级数从1到3不等，受载体的孔结构、B2O3负载量和丙烷分压的影响。这种可变性表明，载体的结构特征和硼活性位点在多孔框架中的分布对反应动力学有实质性影响。

该研究没有提供将B活性组分纳入结构的详细方法，或它们对不同催化应用的相对有效性。然而，很明显，三氧化二硼与二氧化硅载体之间的相互作用，以及载体的孔结构，在决定丙烷氧化脱氢的催化性能中起着关键作用。

The literature does not provide detailed information on the structural characteristics of B-based materials with 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks or methods to incorporate B active components into these structures. The text primarily focuses on the kinetics of oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) on boron oxide catalysts.

However, the literature does mention some aspects related to the porous structure and its impact on catalytic performance:

1. Boron oxide supported on silica with different pore structures was studied.

2. The degree of confinement of active boron sites, derived from the support, affects the formation rate of propylene. Specifically, the rate decreases with increased confinement.

3. The pore structure of supports influences the apparent propane reaction order of B2O3/SiO2.

These observations suggest that the structural characteristics of the support and the degree of confinement of boron active sites play a role in the catalytic performance. However, the literature does not provide enough information to fully analyze the structural characteristics or evaluate the methods used to incorporate B active components into these structures.

该文献并未提供有关具有三维分散活性位点的B基材料在多孔框架中的结构特征或将B活性组分并入这些结构的方法的详细信息。文本主要集中在硼氧化物催化剂上丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）的动力学研究。

然而，文献确实提到了一些与多孔结构及其对催化性能影响相关的方面：

1. 研究了不同孔结构的硅胶负载的硼氧化物。

2. 源自载体的活性硼位点的限域程度影响丙烯的生成速率。具体来说，随着限域程度的增加，速率降低。

3. 载体的孔结构影响B2O3/SiO2的表观丙烷反应级数。

这些观察结果表明，载体的结构特征和硼活性位点的限域程度对催化性能起着作用。然而，该文献没有提供足够的信息来全面分析结构特征或评估将B活性组分并入这些结构的方法。

The literature does not provide sufficient information to fully analyze the structural characteristics of B-based materials with 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks or critically evaluate methods for incorporating B active components. However, it does offer some insights related to the question:

The study focuses on boron oxide (B2O3) supported on silica with different pore structures, which represents a form of B-based material in a porous framework. The research indicates that the degree of confinement of active boron sites, derived from the support structure, impacts catalytic performance. Specifically, increased confinement leads to decreased propylene formation rates in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP).

The catalytic behavior is influenced by the pore structure of supports, the loading of B2O3, and the partial pressure of propane. These factors affect the apparent reaction order of propane, which varies from 1 to 3. This suggests that the structural characteristics of the support and the distribution of boron active sites play crucial roles in determining catalytic performance.

While the study does not explicitly discuss methods for incorporating B active components, it implies that the choice of support material and the loading of B2O3 are important factors in creating effective catalysts. The research also highlights the complexity of the catalytic mechanism, which is not yet fully understood, particularly regarding the observed supra-linear reaction order of alkanes.

Overall, this study emphasizes the importance of spatial confinement and support structure in B-based catalysts for ODHP, but does not provide a comprehensive analysis of 3-D dispersed active sites or methods for incorporating B active components for different catalytic applications.

文献没有提供足够的信息来全面分析具有三维分散活性位点的B基材料的结构特征，或批判性地评估引入B活性组分的方法。然而，它确实提供了一些与问题相关的见解：

这项研究关注于以不同孔结构的二氧化硅为载体的三氧化二硼（B2O3），这代表了多孔框架中B基材料的一种形式。研究表明，源自载体结构的活性硼位点的限制程度影响催化性能。具体来说，限制程度的增加导致丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）中丙烯生成速率的降低。

催化行为受到载体的孔结构、B2O3的负载量以及丙烷分压的影响。这些因素影响丙烷的表观反应级数，该级数在1到3之间变化。这表明载体的结构特征和硼活性位点的分布在决定催化性能方面起着关键作用。

虽然该研究没有明确讨论引入B活性组分的方法，但它暗示了载体材料的选择和B2O3的负载量是创建有效催化剂的重要因素。研究还强调了催化机理的复杂性，特别是关于烷烃观察到的超线性反应级数，这一机理尚未完全理解。

总的来说，这项研究强调了空间限制和载体结构在ODHP的B基催化剂中的重要性，但没有提供关于三维分散活性位点的全面分析，也没有提供针对不同催化应用引入B活性组分的方法。

The literature does not provide comprehensive information about the structural characteristics of B-based materials with 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks or methods to incorporate B active components into these structures. However, it does mention some aspects related to the catalytic performance of boron-based materials in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP).

Boron-based catalysts, including B2O3 supported on silica, demonstrate high alkene selectivity in ODHP. The catalytic performance is influenced by the spatial confinement of active boron sites. The formation rate of propylene decreases as the degree of confinement increases, suggesting that the dispersion and accessibility of boron active sites play a crucial role in catalytic activity.

The apparent reaction order of propane varies from 1 to 3 for B2O3/SiO2 catalysts, which is affected by the pore structure of supports, B2O3 loading, and partial pressure of propane. This variation in reaction order indicates that the structural characteristics of the support and the distribution of boron species impact the catalytic behavior.

While the literature doesn't explicitly discuss methods for incorporating B active components into porous frameworks, it implies that the loading of B2O3 on silica supports is a method used to create catalysts with dispersed boron sites. The effectiveness of this method appears to depend on the pore structure of the support and the amount of B2O3 loaded.

The study focuses primarily on kinetic investigations rather than structural characterization, so a comprehensive analysis of the 3-D dispersed active sites and their enhancement of catalytic performance is not possible based solely on this literature. Further research would be needed to critically evaluate the methods used to incorporate B active components and their effectiveness for different catalytic applications.

该文献并未提供关于具有三维分散活性位点的B基材料在多孔框架中的结构特征或将B活性组分引入这些结构的方法的全面信息。然而，它确实提到了一些与硼基材料在丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）中的催化性能相关的方面。

硼基催化剂，包括负载在二氧化硅上的B2O3，在ODHP中表现出高烯烃选择性。催化性能受到活性硼位点空间限制的影响。随着限制程度的增加，丙烯的生成速率降低，这表明硼活性位点的分散性和可及性在催化活性中起着至关重要的作用。

对于B2O3/SiO2催化剂，丙烷的表观反应级数从1到3不等，这受到载体的孔结构、B2O3负载量和丙烷分压的影响。反应级数的这种变化表明，载体的结构特征和硼物种的分布影响着催化行为。

虽然文献没有明确讨论将B活性组分引入多孔框架的方法，但它暗示在二氧化硅载体上负载B2O3是一种用于创建具有分散硼位点的催化剂的方法。这种方法的有效性似乎取决于载体的孔结构和负载的B2O3量。

该研究主要集中在动力学研究上，而不是结构表征，因此仅基于这篇文献无法对三维分散活性位点及其对催化性能的增强进行全面分析。需要进一步的研究来批判性地评估用于引入B活性组分的方法及其对不同催化应用的有效性。

The structural characteristics of these B-based materials appear to influence catalytic performance. Specifically, the degree of confinement of active boron sites affects the formation rate of propylene, with higher confinement leading to decreased rates.

The pore structure of supports, along with B2O3 loading and propane partial pressure, impacts the apparent propane reaction order. This indicates that the structural characteristics of the support and the distribution of boron oxide within the porous framework play a crucial role in determining catalytic behavior.
