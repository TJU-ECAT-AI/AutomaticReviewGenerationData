The literature does not provide comprehensive information about the structural characteristics of B-based materials with 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks or methods to incorporate B active components into these structures. However, it does mention some aspects related to the catalytic performance of boron-based materials in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP).

Boron-based catalysts, including B2O3 supported on silica, demonstrate high alkene selectivity in ODHP. The catalytic performance is influenced by the spatial confinement of active boron sites. The formation rate of propylene decreases as the degree of confinement increases, suggesting that the dispersion and accessibility of boron active sites play a crucial role in catalytic activity.

The apparent reaction order of propane varies from 1 to 3 for B2O3/SiO2 catalysts, which is affected by the pore structure of supports, B2O3 loading, and partial pressure of propane. This variation in reaction order indicates that the structural characteristics of the support and the distribution of boron species impact the catalytic behavior.

While the literature doesn't explicitly discuss methods for incorporating B active components into porous frameworks, it implies that the loading of B2O3 on silica supports is a method used to create catalysts with dispersed boron sites. The effectiveness of this method appears to depend on the pore structure of the support and the amount of B2O3 loaded.

The study focuses primarily on kinetic investigations rather than structural characterization, so a comprehensive analysis of the 3-D dispersed active sites and their enhancement of catalytic performance is not possible based solely on this literature. Further research would be needed to critically evaluate the methods used to incorporate B active components and their effectiveness for different catalytic applications.

该文献并未提供关于具有三维分散活性位点的B基材料在多孔框架中的结构特征或将B活性组分引入这些结构的方法的全面信息。然而，它确实提到了一些与硼基材料在丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）中的催化性能相关的方面。

硼基催化剂，包括负载在二氧化硅上的B2O3，在ODHP中表现出高烯烃选择性。催化性能受到活性硼位点空间限制的影响。随着限制程度的增加，丙烯的生成速率降低，这表明硼活性位点的分散性和可及性在催化活性中起着至关重要的作用。

对于B2O3/SiO2催化剂，丙烷的表观反应级数从1到3不等，这受到载体的孔结构、B2O3负载量和丙烷分压的影响。反应级数的这种变化表明，载体的结构特征和硼物种的分布影响着催化行为。

虽然文献没有明确讨论将B活性组分引入多孔框架的方法，但它暗示在二氧化硅载体上负载B2O3是一种用于创建具有分散硼位点的催化剂的方法。这种方法的有效性似乎取决于载体的孔结构和负载的B2O3量。

该研究主要集中在动力学研究上，而不是结构表征，因此仅基于这篇文献无法对三维分散活性位点及其对催化性能的增强进行全面分析。需要进一步的研究来批判性地评估用于引入B活性组分的方法及其对不同催化应用的有效性。
