[1] "Boron-based catalysts exhibit high alkene selectivity in ODHP, but the understanding of catalytic mechanism remains incomplete, especially regarding the observed supra-linear reaction order of alkanes."

[2] "The formation rate of propylene decreases with the degree of confinement of active boron sites derived from the support."

[3] "The apparent propane order of B2O3/SiO2 varies from 1 to 3, which is impacted by pore structure of supports, loading of B2O3, and partial pressure of propane."

The literature does not provide detailed information on the structural characteristics of B-based materials with 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks or methods to incorporate B active components into these structures. The text primarily focuses on the kinetics of oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) on boron oxide catalysts.

However, the literature does mention some aspects related to the porous structure and its impact on catalytic performance:

1. Boron oxide supported on silica with different pore structures was studied.

2. The degree of confinement of active boron sites, derived from the support, affects the formation rate of propylene. Specifically, the rate decreases with increased confinement.

3. The pore structure of supports influences the apparent propane reaction order of B2O3/SiO2.

These observations suggest that the structural characteristics of the support and the degree of confinement of boron active sites play a role in the catalytic performance. However, the literature does not provide enough information to fully analyze the structural characteristics or evaluate the methods used to incorporate B active components into these structures.

该文献并未提供有关具有三维分散活性位点的B基材料在多孔框架中的结构特征或将B活性组分并入这些结构的方法的详细信息。文本主要集中在硼氧化物催化剂上丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）的动力学研究。

然而，文献确实提到了一些与多孔结构及其对催化性能影响相关的方面：

1. 研究了不同孔结构的硅胶负载的硼氧化物。

2. 源自载体的活性硼位点的限域程度影响丙烯的生成速率。具体来说，随着限域程度的增加，速率降低。

3. 载体的孔结构影响B2O3/SiO2的表观丙烷反应级数。

这些观察结果表明，载体的结构特征和硼活性位点的限域程度对催化性能起着作用。然而，该文献没有提供足够的信息来全面分析结构特征或评估将B活性组分并入这些结构的方法。
