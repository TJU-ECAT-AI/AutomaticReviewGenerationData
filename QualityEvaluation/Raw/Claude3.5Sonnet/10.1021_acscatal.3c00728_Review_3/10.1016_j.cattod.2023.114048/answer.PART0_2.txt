The literature does not provide sufficient information to fully analyze the structural characteristics of B-based materials with 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks or critically evaluate methods for incorporating B active components. However, it does offer some insights related to the question:

The study focuses on boron oxide (B2O3) supported on silica with different pore structures, which represents a form of B-based material in a porous framework. The research indicates that the degree of confinement of active boron sites, derived from the support structure, impacts catalytic performance. Specifically, increased confinement leads to decreased propylene formation rates in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP).

The catalytic behavior is influenced by the pore structure of supports, the loading of B2O3, and the partial pressure of propane. These factors affect the apparent reaction order of propane, which varies from 1 to 3. This suggests that the structural characteristics of the support and the distribution of boron active sites play crucial roles in determining catalytic performance.

While the study does not explicitly discuss methods for incorporating B active components, it implies that the choice of support material and the loading of B2O3 are important factors in creating effective catalysts. The research also highlights the complexity of the catalytic mechanism, which is not yet fully understood, particularly regarding the observed supra-linear reaction order of alkanes.

Overall, this study emphasizes the importance of spatial confinement and support structure in B-based catalysts for ODHP, but does not provide a comprehensive analysis of 3-D dispersed active sites or methods for incorporating B active components for different catalytic applications.

文献没有提供足够的信息来全面分析具有三维分散活性位点的B基材料的结构特征，或批判性地评估引入B活性组分的方法。然而，它确实提供了一些与问题相关的见解：

这项研究关注于以不同孔结构的二氧化硅为载体的三氧化二硼（B2O3），这代表了多孔框架中B基材料的一种形式。研究表明，源自载体结构的活性硼位点的限制程度影响催化性能。具体来说，限制程度的增加导致丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）中丙烯生成速率的降低。

催化行为受到载体的孔结构、B2O3的负载量以及丙烷分压的影响。这些因素影响丙烷的表观反应级数，该级数在1到3之间变化。这表明载体的结构特征和硼活性位点的分布在决定催化性能方面起着关键作用。

虽然该研究没有明确讨论引入B活性组分的方法，但它暗示了载体材料的选择和B2O3的负载量是创建有效催化剂的重要因素。研究还强调了催化机理的复杂性，特别是关于烷烃观察到的超线性反应级数，这一机理尚未完全理解。

总的来说，这项研究强调了空间限制和载体结构在ODHP的B基催化剂中的重要性，但没有提供关于三维分散活性位点的全面分析，也没有提供针对不同催化应用引入B活性组分的方法。
