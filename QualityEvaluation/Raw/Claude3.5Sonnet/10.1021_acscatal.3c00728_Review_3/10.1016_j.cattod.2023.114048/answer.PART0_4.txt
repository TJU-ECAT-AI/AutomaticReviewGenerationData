The literature does not provide sufficient information to fully analyze the structural characteristics of B-based materials with 3-D dispersed active sites in porous frameworks or critically evaluate the methods used to incorporate B active components into these structures. However, some relevant insights can be drawn from the available information:

The study focuses on boron oxide supported on silica with different pore structures, which suggests a 3-D dispersed active site configuration. The research investigates the impact of spatial confinement on catalytic performance and kinetics.

The structural characteristics of these B-based materials appear to influence catalytic performance. Specifically, the degree of confinement of active boron sites affects the formation rate of propylene, with higher confinement leading to decreased rates.

The pore structure of supports, along with B2O3 loading and propane partial pressure, impacts the apparent propane reaction order. This indicates that the structural characteristics of the support and the distribution of boron oxide within the porous framework play a crucial role in determining catalytic behavior.

The study does not provide detailed information on the methods used to incorporate B active components into the structures or their relative effectiveness for different catalytic applications. However, it does highlight the importance of considering spatial confinement and support characteristics when designing B-based catalysts for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP).

Further research would be needed to fully address the question and provide a comprehensive analysis of 3-D dispersed B-based materials in porous frameworks and their incorporation methods for various catalytic applications.

文献没有提供足够的信息来全面分析具有3-D分散活性位点的B基材料在多孔框架中的结构特征，或批判性地评估将B活性组分纳入这些结构的方法。然而，从可用信息中可以得出一些相关见解：

该研究集中在具有不同孔结构的硅胶上负载的三氧化二硼，这表明存在3-D分散的活性位点配置。研究调查了空间限制对催化性能和动力学的影响。

这些B基材料的结构特征似乎影响催化性能。具体来说，活性硼位点的限制程度影响丙烯的生成速率，限制程度越高，速率越低。

载体的孔结构，以及B2O3负载量和丙烷分压，影响表观丙烷反应级数。这表明载体的结构特征和三氧化二硼在多孔框架中的分布在决定催化行为方面起着关键作用。

该研究没有提供将B活性组分纳入结构的详细方法信息，也没有提供它们对不同催化应用的相对有效性。然而，它确实强调了在设计用于丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）的B基催化剂时，考虑空间限制和载体特性的重要性。

需要进一步的研究来全面回答这个问题，并对多孔框架中的3-D分散B基材料及其在各种催化应用中的纳入方法进行全面分析。
