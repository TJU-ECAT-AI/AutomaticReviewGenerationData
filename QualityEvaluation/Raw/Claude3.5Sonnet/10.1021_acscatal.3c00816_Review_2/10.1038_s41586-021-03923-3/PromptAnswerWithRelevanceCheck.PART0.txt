[1] "Here, we introduce a method for preparation of environmentally compatible supported catalysts based on commercial ZnO. This metal oxide and a support (zeolite or common metal oxide) are used as a physical mixture or in the form of two layers with ZnO as the upstream layer."

[2] "Supported ZnOx species are in situ formed through a reaction of support OH groups with Zn atoms generated from ZnO upon reductive treatment above 550C."

[3] "Using different complementary characterization methods, we identify the decisive role of defective OH groups for the formation of active ZnOx species."

The literature does not provide specific information about MFI and BEA topological zeolites or their dominance in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. Instead, it introduces a new method for preparing environmentally compatible supported catalysts using commercial ZnO and a support, which can be a zeolite or common metal oxide. The synthesis method involves either a physical mixture or a two-layer arrangement with ZnO as the upstream layer.

The formation of active ZnOx species occurs in situ through a reaction between support OH groups and Zn atoms generated from ZnO during reductive treatment above 550°C. The study identifies the crucial role of defective OH groups in forming these active species.

While this information doesn't directly address the question about MFI and BEA zeolites, it does provide insights into a novel approach for PDH catalyst design. The focus on environmentally compatible catalysts and the use of ZnO suggests a shift towards more sustainable and efficient catalyst development in PDH reactions. Future developments in PDH catalyst design may build upon this approach, exploring different zeolite supports and their interactions with ZnO to optimize catalyst performance and environmental compatibility.

该文献没有提供关于MFI和BEA拓扑结构沸石或它们在丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中占主导地位的具体信息。相反，它介绍了一种使用商业ZnO和支撑体（可以是沸石或常见金属氧化物）制备环境兼容性负载型催化剂的新方法。合成方法涉及物理混合或以ZnO为上游层的两层排列。

活性ZnOx物种的形成是通过在550°C以上还原处理过程中，支撑体OH基团与从ZnO生成的Zn原子之间的反应原位形成的。研究确定了缺陷OH基团在形成这些活性物种中的关键作用。

虽然这些信息并不直接回答关于MFI和BEA沸石的问题，但它确实为PDH催化剂设计提供了一种新颖的方法。对环境兼容性催化剂的关注和ZnO的使用表明，PDH反应中催化剂开发正朝着更可持续和高效的方向发展。PDH催化剂设计的未来发展可能会在此方法的基础上，探索不同的沸石支撑体及其与ZnO的相互作用，以优化催化剂性能和环境兼容性。

The literature does not provide specific information about MFI and BEA topological zeolites or their dominance in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. Instead, it introduces a new method for preparing supported catalysts based on commercial ZnO. The synthesis method described involves using ZnO with a support, which can be a zeolite or common metal oxide. The supports are used either as a physical mixture with ZnO or in a layered configuration with ZnO as the upstream layer.

The formation of active ZnOx species occurs in situ through a reaction between the support's OH groups and Zn atoms generated from ZnO during reductive treatment above 550°C. The study emphasizes the crucial role of defective OH groups in forming these active species.

While this information doesn't directly address the question about MFI and BEA zeolites, it does provide insight into a novel approach for PDH catalyst design. The use of ZnO-based catalysts with various supports, including zeolites, suggests that the structural characteristics of the support material play a significant role in catalyst effectiveness. This approach may have implications for future developments in PDH catalyst design, potentially offering an environmentally compatible alternative to traditional Cr- or Pt-based catalysts.
