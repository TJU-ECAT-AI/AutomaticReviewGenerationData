The literature does not provide specific information about MFI and BEA topological zeolites or their dominance in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) applications. Instead, it introduces a new method for preparing environmentally compatible supported catalysts using commercial ZnO and a support, which can be a zeolite or common metal oxide. The synthesis method involves either a physical mixture or a two-layer structure with ZnO as the upstream layer.

The formation of active ZnOx species occurs in situ through a reaction between the support's OH groups and Zn atoms generated from ZnO during reductive treatment above 550°C. The study emphasizes the crucial role of defective OH groups in forming these active species.

While this information doesn't directly address the question about MFI and BEA zeolites, it does provide insight into a novel approach for PDH catalyst design. The use of ZnO-based catalysts offers an environmentally friendly alternative to traditional Cr- or Pt-containing catalysts, which have toxicity or regeneration issues. This new method could have implications for future developments in PDH catalyst design, potentially shifting focus towards more sustainable and efficient catalysts that utilize zeolites or other metal oxides as supports for active ZnOx species.

该文献没有提供关于MFI和BEA拓扑结构沸石或它们在丙烷脱氢(PDH)应用中的主导地位的具体信息。相反，它介绍了一种使用商业ZnO和支撑物（可以是沸石或常见金属氧化物）制备环境兼容性负载型催化剂的新方法。合成方法涉及物理混合或以ZnO作为上游层的两层结构。

活性ZnOx物种的形成是通过在550°C以上还原处理过程中，支撑物的OH基团与由ZnO产生的Zn原子反应in situ形成的。研究强调了缺陷OH基团在形成这些活性物种中的关键作用。

虽然这些信息并不直接回答关于MFI和BEA沸石的问题，但它确实为PDH催化剂设计提供了一种新颖的方法。使用基于ZnO的催化剂为传统的含Cr或Pt催化剂提供了一种环境友好的替代方案，后者存在毒性或再生问题。这种新方法可能对未来PDH催化剂设计的发展产生影响，可能会将焦点转向更可持续和高效的催化剂，这些催化剂利用沸石或其他金属氧化物作为活性ZnOx物种的支撑物。
