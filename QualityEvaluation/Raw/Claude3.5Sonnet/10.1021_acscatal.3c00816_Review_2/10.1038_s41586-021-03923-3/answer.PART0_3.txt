[1] "Here, we introduce a method for preparation of environmentally compatible supported catalysts based on commercial ZnO. This metal oxide and a support (zeolite or common metal oxide) are used as a physical mixture or in the form of two layers with ZnO as the upstream layer."

[2] "Supported ZnOx species are in situ formed through a reaction of support OH groups with Zn atoms generated from ZnO upon reductive treatment above 550C."

[3] "Using different complementary characterization methods, we identify the decisive role of defective OH groups for the formation of active ZnOx species."

The literature does not provide specific information about the primary synthesis methods for metal-zeolite catalysts used in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions, nor does it explain why MFI and BEA topological zeolites dominate in this application. The document focuses on a new method for preparing environmentally compatible supported catalysts based on commercial ZnO, rather than discussing traditional metal-zeolite catalysts.

The literature describes a synthesis method involving the use of ZnO with a support (which can be a zeolite or common metal oxide) either as a physical mixture or in two layers with ZnO as the upstream layer. The active ZnOx species are formed in situ through a reaction between the support's OH groups and Zn atoms generated from ZnO during reductive treatment above 550°C. The study emphasizes the importance of defective OH groups in forming active ZnOx species.

While this information provides insights into a novel catalyst preparation method, it does not address the specific questions about MFI and BEA zeolites or their structural characteristics in PDH applications. Therefore, based solely on the provided literature, it is not possible to fully answer the question as posed.

该文献没有提供关于丙烷脱氢(PDH)反应中使用的金属-沸石催化剂的主要合成方法的具体信息，也没有解释为什么MFI和BEA拓扑结构的沸石在这一应用中占主导地位。该文档主要关注基于商业ZnO的环境友好型负载催化剂的新制备方法，而不是讨论传统的金属-沸石催化剂。

文献描述了一种合成方法，该方法使用ZnO与支撑体（可以是沸石或普通金属氧化物）以物理混合物或两层形式（ZnO作为上游层）组合。活性ZnOx物种通过支撑体上的OH基团与在550°C以上还原处理过程中从ZnO生成的Zn原子反应而原位形成。研究强调了缺陷OH基团在形成活性ZnOx物种中的重要性。

虽然这些信息提供了关于新型催化剂制备方法的见解，但它并未回答有关MFI和BEA沸石或它们在PDH应用中的结构特征的具体问题。因此，仅基于所提供的文献，无法全面回答所提出的问题。
