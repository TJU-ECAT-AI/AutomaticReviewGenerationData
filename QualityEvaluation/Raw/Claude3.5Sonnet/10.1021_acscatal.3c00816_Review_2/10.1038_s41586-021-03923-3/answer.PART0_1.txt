The literature does not provide specific information about MFI and BEA topological zeolites or their dominance in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. Instead, it introduces a new method for preparing supported catalysts based on commercial ZnO. The synthesis method described involves using ZnO with a support, which can be a zeolite or common metal oxide. The supports are used either as a physical mixture with ZnO or in a layered configuration with ZnO as the upstream layer.

The formation of active ZnOx species occurs in situ through a reaction between the support's OH groups and Zn atoms generated from ZnO during reductive treatment above 550°C. The study emphasizes the crucial role of defective OH groups in forming these active species.

While this information doesn't directly address the question about MFI and BEA zeolites, it does provide insight into a novel approach for PDH catalyst design. The use of ZnO-based catalysts with various supports, including zeolites, suggests that the structural characteristics of the support material play a significant role in catalyst effectiveness. This approach may have implications for future developments in PDH catalyst design, potentially offering an environmentally compatible alternative to traditional Cr- or Pt-based catalysts.

该文献并未提供关于MFI和BEA拓扑结构沸石或它们在丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中占主导地位的具体信息。相反，它介绍了一种基于商业ZnO制备负载型催化剂的新方法。所描述的合成方法涉及使用ZnO与支撑体，支撑体可以是沸石或常见的金属氧化物。这些支撑体要么与ZnO以物理混合的方式使用，要么以ZnO作为上游层的层状配置使用。

活性ZnOx物种的形成是通过在550°C以上还原处理过程中，支撑体的OH基团与从ZnO生成的Zn原子反应而原位形成的。研究强调了缺陷OH基团在形成这些活性物种中的关键作用。

虽然这些信息并未直接回答关于MFI和BEA沸石的问题，但它确实为PDH催化剂设计提供了一种新的方法。使用基于ZnO的催化剂与各种支撑体（包括沸石）的做法表明，支撑材料的结构特性在催化剂有效性中起着重要作用。这种方法可能对未来PDH催化剂设计的发展产生影响，可能为传统的基于Cr或Pt的催化剂提供一种环境友好的替代方案。
