[1] "Here, we introduce a method for preparation of environmentally compatible supported catalysts based on commercial ZnO. This metal oxide and a support (zeolite or common metal oxide) are used as a physical mixture or in the form of two layers with ZnO as the upstream layer."

[2] "Supported ZnOx species are in situ formed through a reaction of support OH groups with Zn atoms generated from ZnO upon reductive treatment above 550C."

[3] "Using different complementary characterization methods, we identify the decisive role of defective OH groups for the formation of active ZnOx species."

The provided literature does not contain specific information about MFI and BEA topological zeolites or their dominance in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) applications. The text focuses on a new method for preparing supported catalysts based on commercial ZnO, rather than discussing traditional metal-zeolite catalysts.

The synthesis method described involves using ZnO with a support, which can be a zeolite or common metal oxide. The supported ZnOx species are formed in situ through a reaction between the support's OH groups and Zn atoms generated from ZnO during reductive treatment above 550°C. The study emphasizes the importance of defective OH groups in forming active ZnOx species.

While this information doesn't directly address the question about MFI and BEA zeolites, it does provide insight into a novel approach for PDH catalyst design. The use of ZnO-based catalysts with various supports, including zeolites, suggests that future developments in PDH catalyst design may explore a wider range of materials and synthesis methods beyond traditional metal-zeolite catalysts.

提供的文献中没有关于MFI和BEA拓扑结构沸石或它们在丙烷脱氢（PDH）应用中的主导地位的具体信息。该文本主要关注一种基于商业ZnO的新型负载型催化剂制备方法，而不是讨论传统的金属-沸石催化剂。

所描述的合成方法涉及使用ZnO与一种载体，可以是沸石或常见的金属氧化物。负载的ZnOx物种是通过载体的OH基团与在550°C以上还原处理过程中从ZnO产生的Zn原子反应而原位形成的。研究强调了缺陷OH基团在形成活性ZnOx物种中的重要性。

虽然这些信息并不直接回答关于MFI和BEA沸石的问题，但它确实为PDH催化剂设计提供了一种新颖的方法。使用基于ZnO的催化剂和各种载体（包括沸石）的做法表明，未来PDH催化剂设计的发展可能会探索更广泛的材料和合成方法，而不仅限于传统的金属-沸石催化剂。
