[1] "The synthesis method of metal-zeolite catalysts mainly includes postsynthesis (e.g., ion exchange and impregnation) and direct synthesis (in situ introduce metal sites along with zeolite crystallization)."

[2] "Among them, the MFI and BEA topological zeolites dominate in PDH study (Tables 12), which may be attributed to their relatively facile synthesis procedure, tunable acidity, and moderate pore size."

[3] "Kumar et al. (131) synthesized a set of catalysts with identical Pt loadings and similar Pt dispersion but varied pore geometries (SBA-15, Beta, and ZSM-5). Among the investigated catalysts, Pt-ZSM-5 with the smallest pores shows the highest TOF of 0.24 s1, followed by Pt-Beta (0.21 s1) and Pt-SBA-15 (0.17 s1)."

[4] "The authors attributed the superior performance of microporous materials to the small 3D pores, which may facilitate the interaction between active sites and reactants."

[5] "ZSM-5 also enables various heteroatoms to be incorporated within its framework to anchor impregnated Pt species."

The primary synthesis methods for metal-zeolite catalysts used in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions include postsynthesis methods such as ion exchange and impregnation, as well as direct synthesis methods where metal sites are introduced during zeolite crystallization.

MFI and BEA topological zeolites dominate in PDH applications due to several factors:

1. Facile synthesis procedure: These zeolites are relatively easy to produce, making them attractive for industrial applications.

2. Tunable acidity: The ability to adjust the acidity of these zeolites allows for optimization of catalytic performance in PDH reactions.

3. Moderate pore size: The pore structure of MFI and BEA zeolites contributes to their effectiveness in PDH reactions.

4. Superior performance: Studies have shown that microporous materials like ZSM-5 (MFI topology) exhibit higher turnover frequencies (TOF) compared to mesoporous materials in PDH reactions.

5. Enhanced interaction: The small 3D pores of these zeolites facilitate better interaction between active sites and reactants, leading to improved catalytic performance.

6. Versatility: These zeolites, particularly ZSM-5, allow for the incorporation of various heteroatoms within their framework, which can help anchor impregnated metal species like platinum.

These structural characteristics and properties of MFI and BEA zeolites contribute to their effectiveness in PDH reactions by providing a suitable environment for the active metal species, optimizing reactant-catalyst interactions, and allowing for fine-tuning of catalytic properties.

The implications for future developments in PDH catalyst design include:

1. Further exploration of zeolite framework modifications to enhance metal dispersion and stability.

2. Investigation of novel synthesis methods to create more efficient metal-zeolite interactions.

3. Development of strategies to optimize pore size and structure for improved mass transfer and product selectivity.

4. Research into the incorporation of different heteroatoms to create more active and stable catalysts.

5. Exploration of bimetallic or multi-component systems within zeolite frameworks to enhance catalytic performance and stability.

These directions could lead to the development of more efficient, stable, and selective PDH catalysts based on zeolite materials.
