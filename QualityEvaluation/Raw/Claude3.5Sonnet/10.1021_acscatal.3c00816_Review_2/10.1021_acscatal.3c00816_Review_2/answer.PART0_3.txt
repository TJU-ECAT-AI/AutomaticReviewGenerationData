[1] "Zeolites are microporous crystalline materials consisting of tetrahedra TO4 (T could be Si, Al, P, etc.) linked together at the oxygen corners to form a uniform three-dimensional network."

[2] "The synthesis method of metal-zeolite catalysts mainly includes postsynthesis (e.g., ion exchange and impregnation) and direct synthesis (in situ introduce metal sites along with zeolite crystallization)."

[3] "Among them, the MFI and BEA topological zeolites dominate in PDH study (Tables 12), which may be attributed to their relatively facile synthesis procedure, tunable acidity, and moderate pore size."

[4] "Besides, the propylene selectivity over microporous Pt-ZSM-5 and Pt-Beta is also higher than that over mesoporous Pt-SBA-15. The authors attributed the superior performance of microporous materials to the small 3D pores, which may facilitate the interaction between active sites and reactants."

[5] "S-1 is the Al-free analogue of ZSM-5. The absence of Bronsted acid sites facilitates propylene desorption toward superior propylene selectivity compared to the counterparts with ZSM-5 supports."

The primary synthesis methods for metal-zeolite catalysts used in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions are postsynthesis and direct synthesis. Postsynthesis methods include ion exchange and impregnation, while direct synthesis involves introducing metal sites during zeolite crystallization.

MFI and BEA topological zeolites dominate in PDH applications due to several factors:

1. Facile synthesis procedure: These zeolites are relatively easy to synthesize, making them more accessible for research and industrial applications.

2. Tunable acidity: The ability to adjust the acidity of these zeolites allows for optimizing catalytic performance in PDH reactions.

3. Moderate pore size: The microporous structure of MFI and BEA zeolites, particularly their small 3D pores, facilitates better interaction between active sites and reactants, leading to superior performance compared to mesoporous materials.

4. High propylene selectivity: Microporous materials like Pt-ZSM-5 (MFI) and Pt-Beta (BEA) exhibit higher propylene selectivity compared to mesoporous alternatives.

The structural characteristics of MFI and BEA zeolites contribute to their effectiveness in PDH reactions:

1. Three-dimensional network: The uniform 3D network of interconnected pores allows for efficient mass transfer and access to active sites.

2. Microporous nature: The small pore size enhances the interaction between active sites and reactants, improving catalytic performance.

3. Framework composition: The ability to incorporate various heteroatoms (e.g., Al, Si, Ti) into the framework allows for tailoring the catalyst's properties to suit PDH reactions.

These factors have significant implications for future developments in PDH catalyst design:

1. Optimization of pore size and structure: Researchers may focus on fine-tuning the pore dimensions and connectivity to further enhance reactant-catalyst interactions.

2. Acidity control: Developing methods to precisely control the acidity of zeolites, such as modifying the Si/Al ratio or incorporating other elements, could lead to improved catalytic performance and selectivity.

3. Metal site dispersion: Exploring new techniques to achieve better dispersion and stability of metal active sites within the zeolite framework could enhance catalyst longevity and activity.

4. Multifunctional catalysts: Combining the advantages of different zeolite types or incorporating additional components (e.g., promoters) may lead to more efficient and stable PDH catalysts.

5. Novel synthesis methods: Developing new approaches to synthesize zeolites with desired properties, such as hierarchical structures or defect engineering, could open up new possibilities for PDH catalyst design.

By focusing on these aspects, researchers can continue to improve the performance, selectivity, and stability of metal-zeolite catalysts for PDH reactions, potentially leading to more efficient and sustainable industrial processes.
