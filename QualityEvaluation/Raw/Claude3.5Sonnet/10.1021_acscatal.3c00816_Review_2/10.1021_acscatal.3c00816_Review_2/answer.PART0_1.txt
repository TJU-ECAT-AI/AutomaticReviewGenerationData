[1] "The synthesis method of metal-zeolite catalysts mainly includes postsynthesis (e.g., ion exchange and impregnation) and direct synthesis (in situ introduce metal sites along with zeolite crystallization)."

[2] "Among them, the MFI and BEA topological zeolites dominate in PDH study (Tables 12), which may be attributed to their relatively facile synthesis procedure, tunable acidity, and moderate pore size."

[3] "Kumar et al. (131) synthesized a set of catalysts with identical Pt loadings and similar Pt dispersion but varied pore geometries (SBA-15, Beta, and ZSM-5). Among the investigated catalysts, Pt-ZSM-5 with the smallest pores shows the highest TOF of 0.24 s1, followed by Pt-Beta (0.21 s1) and Pt-SBA-15 (0.17 s1)."

[4] "The authors attributed the superior performance of microporous materials to the small 3D pores, which may facilitate the interaction between active sites and reactants."

The primary synthesis methods for metal-zeolite catalysts used in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions are postsynthesis and direct synthesis. Postsynthesis methods include ion exchange and impregnation, while direct synthesis involves introducing metal sites during zeolite crystallization.

MFI and BEA topological zeolites dominate in PDH applications due to several factors:

1. Facile synthesis procedure: These zeolites are relatively easy to produce, making them attractive for large-scale applications.

2. Tunable acidity: The ability to adjust the acidity of these zeolites allows for better control over catalyst performance and selectivity.

3. Moderate pore size: The pore size of MFI and BEA zeolites is optimal for PDH reactions, facilitating the interaction between active sites and reactants.

4. Superior performance: Studies have shown that microporous materials like ZSM-5 (MFI topology) exhibit higher turnover frequencies (TOF) compared to mesoporous materials.

5. Versatility: These zeolites can incorporate various heteroatoms within their framework, allowing for better anchoring of impregnated metal species.

The structural characteristics of MFI and BEA zeolites, particularly their small 3D pores, contribute to their effectiveness by enhancing the interaction between active sites and reactants. This leads to improved catalytic performance in PDH reactions.

The implications for future developments in PDH catalyst design include:

1. Focus on optimizing pore size and structure to further enhance catalyst-reactant interactions.
2. Exploration of novel methods to incorporate heteroatoms and metal species within zeolite frameworks.
3. Development of strategies to fine-tune acidity and other physicochemical properties of zeolites for improved PDH performance.
4. Investigation of new zeolite topologies that may offer similar or superior characteristics to MFI and BEA for PDH applications.
