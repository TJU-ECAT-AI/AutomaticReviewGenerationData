[1] "The synthesis method of metal-zeolite catalysts mainly includes postsynthesis (e.g., ion exchange and impregnation) and direct synthesis (in situ introduce metal sites along with zeolite crystallization)."

[2] "Among them, the MFI and BEA topological zeolites dominate in PDH study (Tables 12), which may be attributed to their relatively facile synthesis procedure, tunable acidity, and moderate pore size."

[3] "Kumar et al. (131) synthesized a set of catalysts with identical Pt loadings and similar Pt dispersion but varied pore geometries (SBA-15, Beta, and ZSM-5). Among the investigated catalysts, Pt-ZSM-5 with the smallest pores shows the highest TOF of 0.24 s1, followed by Pt-Beta (0.21 s1) and Pt-SBA-15 (0.17 s1)."

[4] "The authors attributed the superior performance of microporous materials to the small 3D pores, which may facilitate the interaction between active sites and reactants."

[5] "ZSM-5 also enables various heteroatoms to be incorporated within its framework to anchor impregnated Pt species."

The primary synthesis methods for metal-zeolite catalysts used in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions are postsynthesis (including ion exchange and impregnation) and direct synthesis. MFI and BEA topological zeolites dominate in PDH applications due to several factors:

1. Facile synthesis procedure: These zeolites are relatively easy to produce, making them more accessible for research and industrial applications.

2. Tunable acidity: The ability to adjust the acidity of these zeolites allows for better control over catalytic properties and reaction outcomes.

3. Moderate pore size: The pore size of MFI and BEA zeolites is particularly suitable for PDH reactions, striking a balance between reactant accessibility and product selectivity.

4. Superior performance: Studies have shown that microporous materials like ZSM-5 (MFI topology) exhibit higher turnover frequencies (TOF) compared to mesoporous materials, likely due to the enhanced interaction between active sites and reactants facilitated by the small 3D pores.

5. Versatility in metal incorporation: These zeolites, particularly ZSM-5, can accommodate various heteroatoms within their framework, which helps anchor impregnated metal species like platinum.

These characteristics contribute to the effectiveness of MFI and BEA zeolites in PDH reactions by providing a stable, tunable, and efficient catalyst support. The implications for future developments in PDH catalyst design include:

1. Further optimization of pore size and structure to enhance reactant-catalyst interactions and product selectivity.

2. Exploration of novel heteroatom incorporations to improve metal dispersion and stability.

3. Development of synthesis methods that allow for even greater control over acidity and metal site distribution.

4. Investigation of hybrid structures or hierarchical porous systems that combine the benefits of microporous and mesoporous materials.

5. Focus on sustainable and cost-effective synthesis methods to make these catalysts more accessible for large-scale industrial applications.
