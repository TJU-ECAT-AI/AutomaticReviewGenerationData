[1] "Zeolites are microporous crystalline materials consisting of tetrahedra TO4 (T could be Si, Al, P, etc.) linked together at the oxygen corners to form a uniform three-dimensional network."

[2] "The synthesis method of metal-zeolite catalysts mainly includes postsynthesis (e.g., ion exchange and impregnation) and direct synthesis (in situ introduce metal sites along with zeolite crystallization)."

[3] "Among them, the MFI and BEA topological zeolites dominate in PDH study (Tables 12), which may be attributed to their relatively facile synthesis procedure, tunable acidity, and moderate pore size."

[4] "Kumar et al. (131) synthesized a set of catalysts with identical Pt loadings and similar Pt dispersion but varied pore geometries (SBA-15, Beta, and ZSM-5). Among the investigated catalysts, Pt-ZSM-5 with the smallest pores shows the highest TOF of 0.24 s1, followed by Pt-Beta (0.21 s1) and Pt-SBA-15 (0.17 s1)."

[5] "Besides, the propylene selectivity over microporous Pt-ZSM-5 and Pt-Beta is also higher than that over mesoporous Pt-SBA-15. The authors attributed the superior performance of microporous materials to the small 3D pores, which may facilitate the interaction between active sites and reactants."

The primary synthesis methods for metal-zeolite catalysts used in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions are postsynthesis and direct synthesis. Postsynthesis methods include ion exchange and impregnation, while direct synthesis involves introducing metal sites during zeolite crystallization.

MFI and BEA topological zeolites dominate in PDH applications due to several factors:

1. Facile synthesis procedure: These zeolites are relatively easy to produce, making them attractive for industrial applications.

2. Tunable acidity: The ability to adjust the acidity of these zeolites allows for better control over catalytic performance and selectivity.

3. Moderate pore size: The pore structure of MFI and BEA zeolites is particularly suitable for PDH reactions.

The structural characteristics of MFI and BEA zeolites contribute to their effectiveness in PDH reactions. Their microporous nature, with small 3D pores, facilitates better interaction between active sites and reactants. This leads to higher turnover frequencies (TOF) and improved propylene selectivity compared to mesoporous materials.

For example, Pt-ZSM-5 (an MFI-type zeolite) shows higher TOF and propylene selectivity compared to Pt-Beta (BEA-type) and Pt-SBA-15 (mesoporous material). This superior performance is attributed to the small 3D pores of the microporous materials.

These findings have important implications for future developments in PDH catalyst design:

1. Focus on microporous materials: The superior performance of microporous zeolites suggests that future catalyst designs should prioritize materials with similar pore structures.

2. Pore size optimization: Fine-tuning the pore size of zeolites could lead to further improvements in catalytic performance.

3. Acidity control: Developing methods to precisely control the acidity of zeolites could allow for better catalyst customization for specific PDH applications.

4. Exploring new topologies: While MFI and BEA dominate current research, investigating other zeolite topologies with similar characteristics could potentially lead to even more effective PDH catalysts.

5. Improving synthesis methods: Enhancing both postsynthesis and direct synthesis techniques could result in more efficient and cost-effective production of high-performance PDH catalysts.

用于丙烷脱氢(PDH)反应的金属-沸石催化剂的主要合成方法是后合成法和直接合成法。后合成法包括离子交换和浸渍，而直接合成法则涉及在沸石结晶过程中引入金属位点。

MFI和BEA拓扑结构的沸石在PDH应用中占主导地位，原因有以下几点：

1. 合成过程简单：这些沸石相对容易生产，使其在工业应用中具有吸引力。

2. 可调酸度：调节这些沸石酸度的能力可以更好地控制催化性能和选择性。

3. 适中的孔径：MFI和BEA沸石的孔结构特别适合PDH反应。

MFI和BEA沸石的结构特征对其在PDH反应中的有效性有重要贡献。它们的微孔性质，具有小的三维孔道，有利于活性位点和反应物之间的更好相互作用。这导致比介孔材料具有更高的转化频率（TOF）和更好的丙烯选择性。

例如，Pt-ZSM-5（MFI型沸石）显示出比Pt-Beta（BEA型）和Pt-SBA-15（介孔材料）更高的TOF和丙烯选择性。这种优越的性能归因于微孔材料的小型三维孔道。

这些发现对PDH催化剂设计的未来发展有重要启示：

1. 关注微孔材料：微孔沸石的优越性能表明，未来的催化剂设计应优先考虑具有类似孔结构的材料。

2. 孔径优化：精细调节沸石的孔径可能会进一步提高催化性能。

3. 酸度控制：开发精确控制沸石酸度的方法可以允许更好地为特定PDH应用定制催化剂。

4. 探索新的拓扑结构：虽然MFI和BEA目前主导研究，但研究具有类似特征的其他沸石拓扑结构可能会导致更有效的PDH催化剂。

5. 改进合成方法：提高后合成和直接合成技术可能会导致更高效、更具成本效益的高性能PDH催化剂生产。
