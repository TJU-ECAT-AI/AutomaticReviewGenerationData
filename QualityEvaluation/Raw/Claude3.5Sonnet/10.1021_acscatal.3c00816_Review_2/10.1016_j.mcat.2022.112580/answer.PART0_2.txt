[1] "Propylene is a vital and basic building block in petrochemical industry, which could be used for the synthesis of various chemicals such as polypropylene, acrylic acid, and acrylonitrile etc"

[2] "Currently, the primary processes for the production of propylene are fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) and steam cracking of naphtha, while they suffer from high-energy consumption, low propylene selectivity and could not meet the increasing demand for propylene."

[3] "In recent decade, with the development of shale-gas and nature gas hydrate extraction technology, raw material propane becomes more abundant and cheaper, correspondingly, propane dehydrogenation to propylene (PDH) is considered as one of the most promising routes to obtain propylene with the advantages of high propylene selectivity"

[4] "Co-based catalysts have attracted much attention for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) because of their low price, environmental friendliness, and high activity, while the synthesis of anti-reduction Co species to suppress cracking side reactions to realize high-performance PDH is critical."

[5] "Recently, Yang and Xie et al [18,19] synthesized the Fe and Zn species incorporated into the framework of MFI zeolite by hydrothermal route and applied to alkane dehydrogenation reaction, the stabilized of Fe and Zn species by zeolite framework facilitated the catalytic activity."

The primary synthesis methods for metal-zeolite catalysts used in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions include hydrothermal synthesis and post-synthesis modification techniques such as ion exchange and impregnation. MFI and BEA topological zeolites dominate in PDH applications due to their unique structural characteristics.

MFI (such as ZSM-5 and Silicalite-1) and BEA (Beta) zeolites have three-dimensional pore systems with medium-sized pores, which are suitable for PDH reactions. These structures allow for the efficient diffusion of propane molecules and product propylene, while also providing high surface area for active metal species dispersion.

The effectiveness of MFI and BEA zeolites in PDH catalysts can be attributed to several factors:

1. Shape selectivity: Their pore sizes are appropriate for propane/propylene molecules, enhancing selectivity.

2. High thermal and hydrothermal stability: Essential for withstanding PDH reaction conditions.

3. Acidity control: The Si/Al ratio can be adjusted to optimize acidity, which is crucial for balancing activity and selectivity.

4. Framework incorporation: These zeolites can accommodate various metal species within their framework, leading to highly dispersed and stable active sites.

5. Synergistic effects: The interaction between metal species and the zeolite structure can enhance catalytic performance.

The implications for future developments in PDH catalyst design include:

1. Further optimization of metal-zeolite interactions to enhance stability and selectivity.

2. Exploration of novel synthesis methods to achieve better control over metal dispersion and location.

3. Development of hierarchical zeolite structures to improve mass transfer properties.

4. Investigation of bimetallic or multi-metal systems incorporated into zeolite frameworks for enhanced performance.

5. Focus on sustainable and environmentally friendly synthesis routes for large-scale production.

These advancements aim to address the ongoing challenges in PDH catalysis, such as catalyst deactivation, coking resistance, and improving propylene yield and selectivity.
