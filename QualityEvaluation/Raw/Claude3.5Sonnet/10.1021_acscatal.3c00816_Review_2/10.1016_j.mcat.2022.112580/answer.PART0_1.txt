[1] "Propylene is a vital and basic building block in petrochemical industry, which could be used for the synthesis of various chemicals such as polypropylene, acrylic acid, and acrylonitrile etc"

[2] "Currently, the primary processes for the production of propylene are fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) and steam cracking of naphtha, while they suffer from high-energy consumption, low propylene selectivity and could not meet the increasing demand for propylene."

[3] "With the development of shale-gas and nature gas hydrate extraction technology, raw material propane becomes more abundant and cheaper, correspondingly, propane dehydrogenation to propylene (PDH) is considered as one of the most promising routes to obtain propylene with the advantages of high propylene selectivity"

[4] "Co-based catalysts have attracted much attention for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) because of their low price, environmental friendliness, and high activity, while the synthesis of anti-reduction Co species to suppress cracking side reactions to realize high-performance PDH is critical."

[5] "It is reported that the tetrahedral coordinated Co2+ species over Al2O3 and SiO2 show high propylene selectivity and catalytic activity, while CoOx clusters and Co3O4 particles would result in severe side reactions including propane cracking and generating coke."

[6] "Recently, Yang and Xie et al [18, 19] synthesized the Fe and Zn species incorporated into the framework of MFI zeolite by hydrothermal route and applied to alkane dehydrogenation reaction, the stabilized of Fe and Zn species by zeolite framework facilitated the catalytic activity."

The primary synthesis methods for metal-zeolite catalysts used in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions include hydrothermal synthesis and incorporation of metal species into zeolite frameworks. MFI and BEA topological zeolites dominate in PDH applications due to their unique structural characteristics that contribute to their effectiveness.

MFI zeolites (such as ZSM-5 and Silicalite-1) have a three-dimensional pore system with straight channels intersected by sinusoidal channels. This structure provides high surface area, shape selectivity, and stability, which are crucial for PDH reactions. BEA zeolites (Beta) have a three-dimensional 12-ring pore system, offering large pore openings and high accessibility for reactants and products.

These zeolites' effectiveness in PDH catalysis stems from several factors:

1. Framework stability: MFI and BEA zeolites have high thermal and hydrothermal stability, allowing them to withstand the harsh conditions of PDH reactions.

2. Acidity control: Their Si/Al ratio can be easily adjusted, allowing fine-tuning of acidity, which is crucial for balancing activity and selectivity in PDH.

3. Metal incorporation: These zeolites can effectively incorporate various metal species (e.g., Co, Fe, Zn) into their framework, stabilizing the active sites and enhancing catalytic performance.

4. Pore structure: Their pore sizes are suitable for propane and propylene molecules, promoting shape selectivity and minimizing side reactions.

5. High dispersion of active sites: The zeolite framework helps in achieving highly dispersed metal species, which is essential for high activity and selectivity in PDH.

The implications for future developments in PDH catalyst design include:

1. Focusing on novel synthesis methods to achieve better control over metal incorporation and distribution within zeolite frameworks.

2. Exploring new combinations of metals and zeolites to further enhance activity, selectivity, and stability.

3. Developing hierarchical zeolite structures to improve mass transfer and accessibility of active sites.

4. Investigating the synergistic effects between different metal species and zeolite frameworks to optimize PDH performance.

5. Employing advanced characterization techniques to gain deeper insights into the nature of active sites and reaction mechanisms, guiding rational catalyst design.

By leveraging these structural advantages and focusing on these areas of development, researchers can continue to improve PDH catalysts based on MFI and BEA zeolites, potentially leading to more efficient and sustainable propylene production processes.
