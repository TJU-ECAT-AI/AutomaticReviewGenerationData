The primary synthesis methods for metal-zeolite catalysts used in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions include hydrothermal synthesis and impregnation methods. The literature describes the synthesis of Silicalite-1 (MFI topology) using a hydrothermal method, which is a common approach for zeolite synthesis.

MFI and BEA topological zeolites dominate in PDH applications due to several factors:

1. Structural characteristics: MFI zeolites, like Silicalite-1, have a three-dimensional pore system with straight and sinusoidal channels. This structure provides high surface area and allows for good dispersion of metal species, which is crucial for catalytic activity.

2. Stability: These zeolites exhibit high thermal and hydrothermal stability, which is essential for the harsh conditions of PDH reactions.

3. Acidity control: MFI and BEA zeolites allow for precise control of acidity, which is important for balancing the dehydrogenation reaction and minimizing side reactions.

4. Metal incorporation: These zeolites can effectively incorporate metal species, such as cobalt, into their framework or as highly dispersed species on the surface.

5. Shape selectivity: The pore structure of MFI and BEA zeolites can provide shape selectivity, potentially enhancing propylene selectivity in PDH reactions.

The effectiveness of these zeolites in PDH is further enhanced by their ability to stabilize active metal species, such as Co2+, in a highly dispersed state. This is evident from the superior performance of Co-S-1-Ar catalyst, which contains highly dispersed tetrahedral Co2+ species incorporated into the Silicalite-1 framework.

Future developments in PDH catalyst design will likely focus on:

1. Optimizing metal incorporation methods to achieve higher dispersion and stability of active species.
2. Fine-tuning zeolite acidity and pore structure to further enhance propylene selectivity.
3. Developing novel synthesis methods to create hierarchical pore structures that combine the benefits of micro- and mesoporosity.
4. Exploring new metal-zeolite combinations to improve catalyst activity, selectivity, and stability.
5. Investigating the use of bimetallic or multi-metallic systems in zeolite frameworks to enhance catalytic performance.

These advancements will aim to address the ongoing challenges in PDH catalysis, such as improving catalyst stability, increasing propylene yield, and minimizing coke formation.
