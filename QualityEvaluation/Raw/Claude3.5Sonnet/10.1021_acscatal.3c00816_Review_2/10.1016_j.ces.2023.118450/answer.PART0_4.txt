MFI and BEA topological zeolites dominate in PDH catalyst applications due to their unique structural characteristics that enable the creation of highly dispersed active sites and tunable metal-support interactions. These zeolites provide a suitable framework for constructing bimetal-siliceous catalysts, which are among the most promising for PDH reactions.

The primary synthesis methods for metal-zeolite catalysts used in PDH reactions involve:

1. Creating mesoporous structures: For MFI zeolites, a method has been developed to synthesize mesoporous Si-MFI structures rich in silanol nests by eliminating framework Ga from Ga-MFI zeolite. This approach increases the surface area and accessibility of active sites.

2. Utilizing high-silica zeolites: For BEA zeolites, high-silica variants are used to construct stable nanoalloy catalysts. The high silica content provides a suitable environment for dispersing metal clusters.

3. Exploiting defect sites: Silanol nests in high-silica zeolites serve as anchoring points for dispersing metal clusters inside the zeolite channels. These defect sites play a crucial role in achieving high dispersion of active sites.

4. Incorporating trace metal sites: Small amounts of metal sites (e.g., Al) in the zeolite framework help stabilize the active site structure by regulating metal-support interactions.

The effectiveness of MFI and BEA zeolites in PDH catalysts stems from their ability to:
- Provide a porous structure that allows for high dispersion of active sites
- Offer tunable metal-support interactions
- Create an environment rich in silanol nests for anchoring metal clusters
- Allow for the incorporation of trace metal sites to enhance stability

These structural characteristics contribute to improved catalyst performance, stability, and longevity in PDH reactions.

Future developments in PDH catalyst design are likely to focus on:
- Further optimization of zeolite structures to enhance metal dispersion and stability
- Fine-tuning of metal-support interactions through precise control of framework composition
- Exploration of new bimetallic combinations compatible with zeolite structures
- Development of synthesis methods that allow for even greater control over defect site creation and metal incorporation

By building upon the strengths of MFI and BEA zeolites while addressing their limitations, researchers can continue to improve the efficiency and durability of PDH catalysts, potentially leading to more sustainable and economical propylene production processes.
