[1] "The titanium silicon zeolite TS-1 required for the catalyst preparation was hydrothermally synthesized using tetrabutyl titanate (TBOT) and fumed silica as the titanium and silicon source, respectively."

[2] "The typical catalysts PtZn/xTS-y and PtZn/S-y containing 0.5 wt% Pt and 0.67 wt% Zn were prepared by impregnating xTS-y and S-y, respectively, with a solution containing the desired amount of Pt(NH3)4(NO3)2 and Zn(NO3)2."

[3] "Clearly, these results are in line with those measured using IR spectroscopy, indicating that the framework Ti could significantly decrease the undesired residual silanol groups on the catalyst surface."

[4] "The PtZn/0.02TS-170 catalyst is not only very highly active, selective, and catalytically durable, but also economically applicable for industrial DHP applications, as the catalyst could be obtained via a simple impregnation process and TS-1 zeolite synthesis is easy and low-cost."

The primary synthesis methods for metal-zeolite catalysts used in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions involve hydrothermal synthesis of the zeolite support followed by impregnation with metal precursors. In this study, TS-1 (titanium silicalite-1) zeolite with MFI topology was synthesized hydrothermally using tetrabutyl titanate and fumed silica. The metal components (Pt and Zn) were then introduced via impregnation.

While the literature does not explicitly discuss why MFI and BEA topologies dominate in PDH applications, we can infer some reasons based on the information provided:

1. Framework structure: MFI zeolites like TS-1 have a three-dimensional pore system that allows good access to active sites and efficient diffusion of reactants and products.

2. Incorporation of heteroatoms: The ability to incorporate titanium into the framework (as in TS-1) enhances metal dispersion and modifies the electronic properties of the active metals.

3. Reduction of silanol groups: The framework Ti in TS-1 decreases undesired residual silanol groups on the catalyst surface, which can improve catalyst durability.

4. Ease of synthesis and cost-effectiveness: TS-1 synthesis is described as easy and low-cost, making it attractive for industrial applications.

These structural characteristics contribute to the effectiveness of MFI zeolites in PDH by providing a stable support with well-dispersed active sites, improved metal-support interactions, and enhanced durability.

The implications for future developments in PDH catalyst design include:

1. Further optimization of zeolite composition and structure to enhance metal dispersion and stability.
2. Exploration of other framework heteroatoms or combinations to tune catalyst properties.
3. Development of synthesis methods to control the distribution and nature of active sites within the zeolite structure.
4. Focus on scalable and economical synthesis routes for industrial viability.

Overall, the success of MFI-based catalysts like TS-1 in PDH reactions suggests that future developments will likely continue to leverage the advantageous properties of zeolitic materials while seeking to further enhance their performance and cost-effectiveness.

用于丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应的金属-沸石催化剂的主要合成方法包括沸石支撑体的水热合成，随后进行金属前体的浸渍。在这项研究中，具有MFI拓扑结构的TS-1（钛硅石-1）沸石是通过四丁基钛酸酯和气相二氧化硅的水热合成制备的。金属组分（Pt和Zn）然后通过浸渍法引入。

虽然文献没有明确讨论为什么MFI和BEA拓扑结构在PDH应用中占主导地位，但我们可以根据提供的信息推断一些原因：

1. 框架结构：像TS-1这样的MFI沸石具有三维孔道系统，可以让活性位点更容易被接触到，并且使反应物和产物能够高效扩散。

2. 杂原子的引入：将钛引入框架（如TS-1中）可以提高金属分散度并修饰活性金属的电子性质。

3. 硅羟基的减少：TS-1中的框架钛可以减少催化剂表面上不需要的残余硅羟基，从而提高催化剂的耐久性。

4. 合成简便和成本效益：TS-1的合成被描述为简单且低成本，这使其在工业应用中具有吸引力。

这些结构特征通过提供具有良好分散活性位点的稳定载体、改善金属-载体相互作用以及提高耐久性，为MFI沸石在PDH中的有效性做出了贡献。

对PDH催化剂设计未来发展的启示包括：

1. 进一步优化沸石的组成和结构，以提高金属分散度和稳定性。
2. 探索其他框架杂原子或组合以调节催化剂性能。
3. 开发合成方法以控制沸石结构中活性位点的分布和性质。
4. 关注可扩展和经济的合成路线，以实现工业可行性。

总的来说，TS-1等基于MFI的催化剂在PDH反应中的成功表明，未来的发展很可能会继续利用沸石材料的优势特性，同时寻求进一步提高其性能和成本效益。
