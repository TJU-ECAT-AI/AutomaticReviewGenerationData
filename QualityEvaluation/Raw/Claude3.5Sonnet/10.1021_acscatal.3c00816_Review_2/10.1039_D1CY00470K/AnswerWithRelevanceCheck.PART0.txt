          [1] "The titanium silicon zeolite TS-1 required for the catalyst preparation was hydrothermally synthesized using tetrabutyl titanate (TBOT) and fumed silica as the titanium and silicon source, respectively."

[2] "The typical catalysts PtZn/xTS-y and PtZn/S-y containing 0.5 wt% Pt and 0.67 wt% Zn were prepared by impregnating xTS-y and S-y, respectively, with a solution containing the desired amount of Pt(NH3)4(NO3)2 and Zn(NO3)2."

[3] "Clearly, the XRD patterns confirm that the two zeolites have the same typical MFI topology structure"

[4] "The use of the titanium silicon zeolite TS-1 as the PtZn support for preparing the DHP catalyst can significantly improve Pt dispersion, modify Pt and decrease undesired residual silanol groups on the catalyst surface. As a result, it greatly enhanced the activity and the catalytic durability of the catalyst."

[5] "The important roles of TS-1 as the support could be ascribed to the framework titanium, which localizes Pt and Zn together, increasing the dispersion degree of Pt and improving its modification by Zn, as indicated by CO adsorption IR spectra as well as C3H6-TPD."

          The primary synthesis methods for metal-zeolite catalysts used in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions involve hydrothermal synthesis of the zeolite support followed by impregnation with metal precursors. In this study, TS-1 (titanium silicalite-1) zeolite with MFI topology was synthesized hydrothermally using tetrabutyl titanate and fumed silica as titanium and silicon sources, respectively. The metal components (Pt and Zn) were then introduced via impregnation.

MFI topological zeolites dominate in PDH applications due to several structural characteristics that contribute to their effectiveness:

1. Framework incorporation of heteroatoms: The ability to incorporate titanium into the MFI framework (as in TS-1) allows for enhanced metal dispersion and modification.

2. Pore structure: The MFI topology provides suitable pore sizes for PDH reactions, allowing reactant and product diffusion while providing shape selectivity.

3. High surface area: MFI zeolites typically have high surface areas, providing numerous active sites for catalysis.

4. Thermal and hydrothermal stability: MFI zeolites are known for their stability under PDH reaction conditions.

5. Silanol group control: The incorporation of titanium in TS-1 helps reduce undesired silanol groups on the catalyst surface, improving catalytic performance.

The effectiveness of MFI zeolites in PDH catalysts stems from their ability to:
- Improve metal dispersion (particularly Pt)
- Modify metal properties through framework interactions
- Provide a stable support under reaction conditions
- Offer shape selectivity for desired products

These factors contribute to enhanced catalyst activity, selectivity, and durability in PDH reactions.

The implications for future developments in PDH catalyst design include:
- Further exploration of framework heteroatom incorporation to optimize metal-support interactions
- Fine-tuning of pore structures to balance diffusion and shape selectivity
- Development of synthesis methods to control silanol groups and other surface properties
- Investigation of bimetallic systems (like PtZn) supported on modified MFI zeolites to enhance catalytic performance
- Exploration of other zeolite topologies that may offer similar or improved characteristics for PDH reactions

          用于丙烷脱氢(PDH)反应的金属-沸石催化剂的主要合成方法包括沸石支撑体的水热合成，随后进行金属前体的浸渍。在这项研究中，具有MFI拓扑结构的TS-1（钛硅石-1）沸石是通过使用四丁基钛酸酯和气相二氧化硅作为钛源和硅源进行水热合成的，然后用铂和锌的前体进行浸渍，形成PtZn/TS-1催化剂。

MFI拓扑结构的沸石在PDH应用中占主导地位，这是由于几个结构特征对其有效性的贡献：

1. 杂原子的骨架掺杂：将钛掺入MFI骨架（如TS-1中）的能力可以增强金属分散和改性。

2. 孔道结构：MFI拓扑结构为PDH反应提供了合适的孔径，允许反应物和产物扩散，同时提供形状选择性。

3. 高比表面积：MFI沸石通常具有高比表面积，为催化反应提供了众多活性位点。

4. 热稳定性和水热稳定性：MFI沸石以其在PDH反应条件下的稳定性而闻名。

5. 硅羟基控制：TS-1中钛的掺入有助于减少催化剂表面上不需要的硅羟基，从而提高催化性能。

MFI沸石在PDH催化剂中的有效性源于其能够：
- 改善金属分散（尤其是Pt）
- 通过骨架相互作用改性金属性质
- 在反应条件下提供稳定的支撑体
- 为目标产物提供形状选择性

这些因素有助于提高PDH反应中催化剂的活性、选择性和耐久性。

对PDH催化剂设计未来发展的启示包括：
- 进一步探索骨架杂原子掺杂，以优化金属-支撑体相互作用
- 精细调节孔道结构，平衡扩散和形状选择性
- 开发合成方法以控制硅羟基和其他表面性质
- 研究在改性MFI沸石上负载的双金属体系（如PtZn），以增强催化性能
- 探索可能为PDH反应提供类似或更好特性的其他沸石拓扑结构
