[1] "The titanium silicon zeolite TS-1 required for the catalyst preparation was hydrothermally synthesized using tetrabutyl titanate (TBOT) and fumed silica as the titanium and silicon source, respectively."

[2] "The TS-1 zeolites were designated as xTS-y, according to the crystallization conditions, where x indicates the Ti/Si atomic ratio of the mixture and y represents the temperature applied for the crystallization."

[3] "Fig. 1 shows the XRD patterns and SEM images of the two zeolites used as the catalyst supports, 0.02TS-95 and S-95. Flat baselines without bulges in the 2θ range of 15–35 degrees associated with silica could be observed in the XRD patterns, indicating that complete crystallinity was achieved for both zeolites. Moreover, the XRD patterns confirm that the two zeolites have the same typical MFI topology structure"

[4] "The typical catalysts PtZn/xTS-y and PtZn/S-y containing 0.5 wt% Pt and 0.67 wt% Zn were prepared by impregnating xTS-y and S-y, respectively, with a solution containing the desired amount of Pt(NH3)4(NO3)2 and Zn(NO3)2."

[5] "The use of the titanium silicon zeolite TS-1 as the PtZn support for preparing the DHP catalyst can significantly improve Pt dispersion, modify Pt and decrease undesired residual silanol groups on the catalyst surface. As a result, it greatly enhanced the activity and the catalytic durability of the catalyst."

The primary synthesis methods for metal-zeolite catalysts used in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions involve hydrothermal synthesis of the zeolite support followed by impregnation with metal precursors. In this study, TS-1 zeolites with MFI topology were synthesized using tetrabutyl titanate and fumed silica as titanium and silicon sources, respectively. The metal (Pt and Zn) was then loaded onto the zeolite support through impregnation with metal salt solutions.

MFI topological zeolites dominate in PDH applications due to their structural characteristics that contribute to their effectiveness. The MFI structure provides a suitable framework for dispersing and stabilizing metal particles, which is crucial for catalytic activity and durability. The incorporation of titanium into the MFI framework, as in TS-1 zeolites, further enhances the catalyst's performance by improving metal dispersion, modifying the electronic properties of the metal, and reducing undesired silanol groups on the catalyst surface.

The effectiveness of MFI zeolites in PDH catalysts can be attributed to several factors:

1. High surface area and porosity, allowing for good accessibility of reactants to active sites.
2. Thermal and hydrothermal stability, which is important for the high-temperature conditions of PDH reactions.
3. Ability to incorporate heteroatoms (like Ti) into the framework, which can modify the electronic and chemical properties of the catalyst.
4. Strong metal-support interactions, leading to better dispersion and stability of metal particles.

The implications for future developments in PDH catalyst design include:

1. Further optimization of zeolite composition and structure to enhance metal dispersion and stability.
2. Exploration of other zeolite topologies or hierarchical structures that may offer improved mass transfer properties.
3. Investigation of novel metal combinations or alloys that can be effectively supported on zeolite structures.
4. Development of synthesis methods that allow for precise control over the location and distribution of metal species within the zeolite framework.

These advancements could lead to more efficient, stable, and selective catalysts for propane dehydrogenation, potentially improving the economics and sustainability of this important industrial process.

用于丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应的金属-沸石催化剂的主要合成方法包括沸石载体的水热合成，随后进行金属前体的浸渍。在这项研究中，使用四丁基钛酸酯和气相二氧化硅作为钛源和硅源，合成了具有MFI拓扑结构的TS-1沸石。然后通过金属盐溶液的浸渍将金属（Pt和Zn）负载到沸石载体上。

MFI拓扑结构的沸石在PDH应用中占主导地位，这是由于其结构特征有助于其有效性。MFI结构为分散和稳定金属颗粒提供了合适的框架，这对催化活性和耐久性至关重要。将钛掺入MFI框架（如TS-1沸石）进一步提高了催化剂的性能，改善了金属分散度，修饰了金属的电子性质，并减少了催化剂表面不需要的硅羟基。

MFI沸石在PDH催化剂中的有效性可归因于以下几个因素：

1. 高比表面积和孔隙率，使反应物能够很好地接触活性位点。
2. 热稳定性和水热稳定性，这对PDH反应的高温条件很重要。
3. 能够将杂原子（如Ti）掺入框架，可以改变催化剂的电子和化学性质。
4. 强金属-载体相互作用，导致金属颗粒更好的分散和稳定性。

对PDH催化剂设计未来发展的启示包括：

1. 进一步优化沸石组成和结构，以提高金属分散度和稳定性。
2. 探索其他可能提供更好传质性能的沸石拓扑结构或分级结构。
3. 研究可以有效负载在沸石结构上的新型金属组合或合金。
4. 开发允许精确控制金属物种在沸石框架内位置和分布的合成方法。

这些进展可能导致更高效、更稳定和更选择性的丙烷脱氢催化剂，潜在地改善这一重要工业过程的经济性和可持续性。
