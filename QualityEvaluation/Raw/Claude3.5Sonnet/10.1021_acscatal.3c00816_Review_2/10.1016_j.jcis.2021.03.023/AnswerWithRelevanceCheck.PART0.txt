          [1] "Herein, spatially isolated cobalt oxide sites within nitrogen-doped carbon (NC) layers supported on silicalite-1 zeolite (S-1, MFI zeotype) were synthesized by a two-step process consisting of the pyrolysis of bimetallic Zn/Co zeolitic imidazole frameworks loaded on silicalite-1 (ZnCo-ZIF/S-1) under N2 and the subsequent calcination in air atmosphere."

[2] "Silicalite-1 zeolite was prepared according to the reported procedure"

[3] "ZnCo-ZIF/S-1 sample was prepared by introducing the metal precursor onto the silicalite-1 using the wet impregnation method."

[4] "CoOx@NC/S-1(4) (4 represents the molar ratio of Zn and Co) was fabricated through the carbonization process of ZnCo-ZIF/S-1 in N2 atmosphere at 850 C for 2 h with a 5 C min1 heating rate, and the subsequent calcination in air at 300 C for 4 h with a heating rate of 3 C min1."

[5] "Co/S-1 sample was prepared by the incipient wetness co-impregnation method"

[6] "CoOx@NC/S-1 catalyst shows a propane conversion of 40% with the propene selectivity of 97%, and the propane conversion does not decrease significantly after a 10 h PDH reaction at 600 C."

          The literature does not provide a comprehensive analysis of primary synthesis methods for metal-zeolite catalysts used in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions, nor does it explicitly explain why MFI and BEA topological zeolites dominate in this application. However, it does describe some synthesis methods for metal-zeolite catalysts, focusing on a specific cobalt-based catalyst supported on silicalite-1 (MFI-type) zeolite.

The synthesis methods described include:
1. Preparation of silicalite-1 zeolite (MFI type)
2. Wet impregnation method for loading metal precursors onto silicalite-1
3. A two-step process involving:
   a) Pyrolysis of bimetallic Zn/Co zeolitic imidazole frameworks (ZIFs) loaded on silicalite-1 under N2 atmosphere
   b) Subsequent calcination in air
4. Incipient wetness co-impregnation method for preparing Co/S-1 sample

The resulting catalyst (CoOx@NC/S-1) shows good performance in PDH reactions, with 40% propane conversion and 97% propene selectivity, maintaining stability over 10 hours at 600°C.

While the document doesn't explicitly discuss why MFI and BEA zeolites dominate in PDH applications, it does use an MFI-type zeolite (silicalite-1) as a support, suggesting its effectiveness. The high surface area and porous structure of MFI zeolites likely contribute to their usefulness in PDH catalysts by providing good dispersion of active sites and facilitating mass transfer.

For future developments in PDH catalyst design, this synthesis method demonstrates the potential of combining metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) with zeolites to create catalysts with isolated active sites. This approach could be extended to other metal species or zeolite types to further optimize PDH catalyst performance. The focus on creating and stabilizing isolated metal sites suggests that future research may continue to explore strategies for site isolation and protection to enhance catalytic performance and stability in PDH reactions.

          该文献并未提供关于丙烷脱氢(PDH)反应中使用的金属-沸石催化剂的主要合成方法的全面分析，也没有明确解释为什么MFI和BEA拓扑结构的沸石在这一应用中占主导地位。然而，它确实描述了一些金属-沸石催化剂的合成方法，主要集中在以硅铝酸盐-1(MFI型)沸石为载体的特定钴基催化剂上。

所描述的合成方法包括：
1. 制备硅铝酸盐-1沸石(MFI型)
2. 湿法浸渍法将金属前体负载到硅铝酸盐-1上
3. 一个两步过程，包括：
   a) 在N2气氛下对负载在硅铝酸盐-1上的双金属Zn/Co沸石咪唑骨架(ZIFs)进行热解
   b) 随后在空气中煅烧
4. 浸渍共浸渍法制备Co/S-1样品

所得到的催化剂(CoOx@NC/S-1)在PDH反应中表现良好，丙烷转化率为40%，丙烯选择性为97%，在600°C下保持10小时的稳定性。

虽然文档没有明确讨论为什么MFI和BEA沸石在PDH应用中占主导地位，但它确实使用了MFI型沸石(硅铝酸盐-1)作为载体，这表明了其有效性。MFI沸石的高比表面积和多孔结构可能有助于其在PDH催化剂中的应用，因为它们可以提供良好的活性位点分散性并促进物质传递。

对于PDH催化剂设计的未来发展，这种合成方法展示了将金属有机骨架(MOFs)与沸石结合以创造具有隔离活性位点的催化剂的潜力。这种方法可以扩展到其他金属物种或沸石类型，以进一步优化PDH催化剂性能。对创建和稳定孤立金属位点的关注表明，未来的研究可能会继续探索位点隔离和保护的策略，以提高PDH反应中的催化性能和稳定性。
