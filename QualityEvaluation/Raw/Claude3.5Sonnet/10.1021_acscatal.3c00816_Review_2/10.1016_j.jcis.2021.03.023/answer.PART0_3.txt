The literature does not directly address why MFI and BEA topological zeolites dominate in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) applications. However, it does describe some synthesis methods for metal-zeolite catalysts used in PDH reactions:

1. Wet impregnation: Used to prepare ZnCo-ZIF/S-1 by introducing metal precursors onto silicalite-1 (MFI topology).

2. Carbonization and calcination: Used to fabricate CoOx@NC/S-1 from ZnCo-ZIF/S-1 through a two-step process involving pyrolysis in N2 atmosphere followed by calcination in air.

3. Incipient wetness co-impregnation: Used to prepare Co/S-1 sample.

The document focuses on the synthesis of a novel catalyst (CoOx@NC/S-1) using silicalite-1 (MFI topology) as a support, but does not provide information on why MFI and BEA zeolites are preferred for PDH reactions. To fully answer this question, additional research on the structural characteristics of MFI and BEA zeolites and their specific advantages in PDH applications would be necessary.

The synthesis methods described in the literature aim to create isolated metal sites, which have been shown to enhance catalytic performance in PDH reactions. This suggests that future developments in PDH catalyst design may focus on strategies to create and stabilize isolated active sites, potentially using zeolites as supports or templates.

该文献并未直接解释为什么MFI和BEA拓扑结构的沸石在丙烷脱氢（PDH）应用中占主导地位。但是，它确实描述了一些用于PDH反应的金属-沸石催化剂的合成方法：

1. 湿法浸渍：用于通过将金属前体引入硅铝酸盐-1（MFI拓扑结构）来制备ZnCo-ZIF/S-1。

2. 碳化和煅烧：用于通过两步过程制备CoOx@NC/S-1，包括在N2气氛下热解，然后在空气中煅烧。

3. 等体积浸渍法：用于制备Co/S-1样品。

该文献主要关注使用硅铝酸盐-1（MFI拓扑结构）作为载体合成新型催化剂（CoOx@NC/S-1），但没有提供关于为什么MFI和BEA沸石在PDH反应中更受青睐的信息。要全面回答这个问题，需要对MFI和BEA沸石的结构特征及其在PDH应用中的具体优势进行额外研究。

文献中描述的合成方法旨在创建孤立的金属位点，这些位点已被证明可以提高PDH反应的催化性能。这表明，未来PDH催化剂设计的发展可能会集中在创建和稳定孤立活性位点的策略上，可能会使用沸石作为载体或模板。
