[1] "Silicalite-1 zeolite was prepared according to the reported procedure"

[2] "ZnCo-ZIF/S-1 sample was prepared by introducing the metal precursor onto the silicalite-1 using the wet impregnation method."

[3] "CoOx@NC/S-1 (4) (4 represents the molar ratio of Zn and Co) was fabricated through the carbonization process of ZnCo-ZIF/S-1 in N2 atmosphere at 850 C for 2 h with a 5 C min1 heating rate, and the subsequent calcination in air at 300 C for 4 h with a heating rate of 3 C min1."

[4] "Co/S-1 sample was prepared by the incipient wetness co-impregnation method"

The literature does not provide a comprehensive analysis of primary synthesis methods for metal-zeolite catalysts used in PDH reactions, nor does it explain why MFI and BEA topological zeolites dominate in this application. The document focuses on a specific synthesis method for a cobalt-based catalyst supported on silicalite-1 (MFI type) zeolite.

The synthesis methods mentioned in the literature include:
1. Preparation of silicalite-1 zeolite (MFI type)
2. Wet impregnation method for loading metal precursors onto silicalite-1
3. Carbonization and calcination process for creating isolated cobalt oxide sites
4. Incipient wetness co-impregnation method for preparing Co/S-1 sample

The document does not discuss the structural characteristics of MFI and BEA zeolites or their specific contributions to PDH catalyst effectiveness. It also does not provide information on the implications for future developments in PDH catalyst design.

Given the limited information provided in the literature, a comprehensive answer to the question cannot be formulated based solely on this document.

该文献并未对丙烷脱氢(PDH)反应中使用的金属-沸石催化剂的主要合成方法进行全面分析，也没有解释为什么MFI和BEA拓扑结构的沸石在这一应用中占主导地位。文档主要关注了一种特定的合成方法，用于制备以硅铝酸盐-1(MFI型)沸石为载体的钴基催化剂。

文献中提到的合成方法包括：
1. 制备硅铝酸盐-1沸石(MFI型)
2. 湿法浸渍法将金属前体负载到硅铝酸盐-1上
3. 碳化和煅烧过程，用于创建孤立的氧化钴位点
4. 浸渍共浸渍法制备Co/S-1样品

文档并未讨论MFI和BEA沸石的结构特征或它们对PDH催化剂有效性的具体贡献。它也没有提供关于PDH催化剂设计未来发展的启示信息。

鉴于文献提供的信息有限，仅基于这份文档无法对该问题提供全面的回答。
