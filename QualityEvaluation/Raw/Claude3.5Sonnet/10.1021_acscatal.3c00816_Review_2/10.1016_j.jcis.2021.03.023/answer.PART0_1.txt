[1] "Silicalite-1 zeolite was prepared according to the reported procedure"

[2] "ZnCo-ZIF/S-1 sample was prepared by introducing the metal precursor onto the silicalite-1 using the wet impregnation method."

[3] "CoOx@NC/S-1(4) (4 represents the molar ratio of Zn and Co) was fabricated through the carbonization process of ZnCo-ZIF/S-1 in N2 atmosphere at 850 C for 2 h with a 5 C min1 heating rate, and the subsequent calcination in air at 300 C for 4 h with a heating rate of 3 C min1."

[4] "Co/S-1 sample was prepared by the incipient wetness co-impregnation method"

The literature does not provide a comprehensive analysis of primary synthesis methods for metal-zeolite catalysts used in PDH reactions, nor does it explain why MFI and BEA topological zeolites dominate in this application. The document only mentions silicalite-1 (MFI zeotype) as a support material for the catalyst synthesis.

The synthesis methods described in the text include:
1. Preparation of silicalite-1 zeolite
2. Wet impregnation method for ZnCo-ZIF/S-1
3. Carbonization and calcination process for CoOx@NC/S-1
4. Incipient wetness co-impregnation method for Co/S-1

The literature does not discuss the structural characteristics of MFI and BEA zeolites or their contribution to PDH catalyst effectiveness. It also does not provide information on future developments in PDH catalyst design based on these zeolite types.

Given the limited information provided, it is not possible to fully answer the question as posed. More comprehensive research on metal-zeolite catalysts for PDH reactions, including comparisons between different zeolite topologies and their structural advantages, would be needed to address the question adequately.

文献并未提供用于PDH反应的金属-沸石催化剂的主要合成方法的全面分析，也没有解释为什么MFI和BEA拓扑结构的沸石在这一应用中占主导地位。文档仅提到了硅酸盐-1（MFI类型）作为催化剂合成的支撑材料。

文中描述的合成方法包括：
1. 硅酸盐-1沸石的制备
2. ZnCo-ZIF/S-1的湿法浸渍法
3. CoOx@NC/S-1的碳化和煅烧过程
4. Co/S-1的浸渍共浸渍法

文献没有讨论MFI和BEA沸石的结构特征或它们对PDH催化剂有效性的贡献。它也没有提供基于这些沸石类型的PDH催化剂设计的未来发展信息。

鉴于提供的信息有限，无法全面回答所提出的问题。需要对PDH反应的金属-沸石催化剂进行更全面的研究，包括不同沸石拓扑结构之间的比较及其结构优势，才能充分回答这个问题。
