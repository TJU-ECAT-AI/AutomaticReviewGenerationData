The literature does not provide comprehensive information about primary synthesis methods for metal-zeolite catalysts used in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions, nor does it explain why MFI and BEA topological zeolites dominate in this application. The document focuses on a specific synthesis method for a cobalt-based catalyst supported on silicalite-1 (MFI-type) zeolite.

The synthesis method described involves a two-step process:
1. Pyrolysis of bimetallic Zn/Co zeolitic imidazole frameworks (ZIFs) loaded on silicalite-1 under N2 atmosphere.
2. Subsequent calcination in air.

This method results in spatially isolated cobalt oxide sites within nitrogen-doped carbon layers supported on silicalite-1 zeolite. The catalyst shows good performance in PDH reactions, with 40% propane conversion and 97% propene selectivity, maintaining stability over 10 hours at 600°C.

While the document doesn't explicitly discuss why MFI and BEA zeolites dominate in PDH applications, it does use an MFI-type zeolite (silicalite-1) as a support, suggesting its effectiveness. The high surface area and porous structure of MFI zeolites likely contribute to their usefulness in PDH catalysts by providing good dispersion of active sites and facilitating mass transfer.

For future developments in PDH catalyst design, this synthesis method demonstrates the potential of combining metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) with zeolites to create catalysts with isolated active sites. This approach could be extended to other metal species or zeolite types to further optimize PDH catalyst performance.

该文献并未提供关于丙烷脱氢(PDH)反应中使用的金属-沸石催化剂的主要合成方法的全面信息，也没有解释为什么MFI和BEA拓扑结构的沸石在这一应用中占主导地位。文档主要集中讨论了一种以硅铝酸盐-1(MFI型)沸石为载体的钴基催化剂的特定合成方法。

所描述的合成方法包括两个步骤：
1. 在N2气氛下对负载在硅铝酸盐-1上的双金属Zn/Co沸石咪唑骨架(ZIFs)进行热解。
2. 随后在空气中煅烧。

这种方法产生了空间隔离的钴氧化物位点，这些位点位于以硅铝酸盐-1沸石为载体的氮掺杂碳层内。该催化剂在PDH反应中表现良好，丙烷转化率为40%，丙烯选择性为97%，在600°C下保持10小时的稳定性。

虽然文档没有明确讨论为什么MFI和BEA沸石在PDH应用中占主导地位，但它确实使用了MFI型沸石(硅铝酸盐-1)作为载体，这表明了其有效性。MFI沸石的高比表面积和多孔结构可能有助于其在PDH催化剂中的应用，因为它们可以提供良好的活性位点分散性并促进物质传递。

对于PDH催化剂设计的未来发展，这种合成方法展示了将金属有机骨架(MOFs)与沸石结合以创造具有隔离活性位点的催化剂的潜力。这种方法可以扩展到其他金属物种或沸石类型，以进一步优化PDH催化剂性能。
