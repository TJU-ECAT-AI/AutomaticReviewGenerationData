CrOx supported on high-silica HZSM-5 for propane dehydrogenation
Abstract
Industrial propane dehydrogenation (PDH) catalysts generally suffer from low catalytic stability due to the coke formation onto the catalyst surface to cover the active sites. The exploitation of an efficient catalyst with both high catalytic selectivity and long-term stability toward PDH is of great importance but challenging to make. Herein CrOx supported on high-silica HZSM-5 with a SiO2/Al2O3 ratio of 260 (Cr/Z-5(260) is synthesized by a simple wet impregnation method, which exhibits high catalytic activity, good selectivity and excellent stability for PDH. At a weight hourly space velocity (WHSV) of 0.59 h1, a propylene formation rate of 4.1 mmol gcat1 h1 ( 32.6% propane conversion and  94.2% propylene selectivity) can be maintained over the 5%Cr/Z-5(260) catalyst after 50 h time on stream, which is much better than commercial Cr/Al2O3 (Catofin process, catalyst life is several hours) at the same reaction conditions. With increasing the WHSV to 5.9 h1, a high propylene formation rate of 27.9 mmol gcat1 h1 can be obtained over the 5%Cr/Z-5(260) catalyst after 50 h time on stream, demonstrating a very promising PDH catalyst. Characterization results and Na+ doping experiments reveal that the Cr species combined with Brnsted acid sites in Cr/HZSM-5 catalysts are responsible for the high catalytic performance. In particular, the Brnsted acid sites in HZSM-5 zeolite could increase the propane adsorption and enhance the CH bond activation. Furthermore, the high surface area and well-defined pores of HZSM-5 zeolite can provide a special environment for the dispersion and stabilization of Cr species, thus guaranteeing high catalytic activity and stability.

1. Introduction
Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) has drawn particular attention in recent years due to the growing demand of propylene and the increasing production of propane from shale gas

. For various reasons, CrOx-Al2O3 based catalysts have been commercially utilized in Catofin process
[1

. However, a great challenge for this catalyst system is the serious coke formation during the catalytic reaction, which significantly shortens the catalyst life. In the past decades, considerable efforts have been made to increase the stability of CrOx catalysts by loading them onto porous supports such as SBA-15, mesoporous carbon and ordered mesoporous ZrO2
[11
,

,

. After Cr species are supported, their physicochemical properties (e.g., reducibility, dispersion, structure and electronic properties) would be greatly changed
[1
,

. It was reported that the low-coordinated Cr3+ species were the active sites for PDH, but they tended to aggregate, leading to low activity and regenerability
[1
,

,

,

. For instance, Cr species supported on ZrO2 were observed to deactivate faster than Cr/Al2O3 in PDH due to the presence of weak metal-support interactions between Cr species and ZrO2
[13]
. Also, it was reported that metal species supported on nanocarbons exhibited high catalytic activity and stability for dehydrogenation and hydrogenation reactions, due to the presence of strong interactions between metal and nanocarbon supports
[21]
,
[22]
,
[23]
. Therefore, the selection of supports for preparation of Cr-based catalysts for PDH is of great significance.
Zeolites, possessing high surface area, well-defined channels, good thermal stability and tunable acidity, can be used as catalysts or supports for various catalytic reactions
[24]
,
[25]
,
[26]
,
[27]
,
[28]
,
[29]
. In particular, ZSM-5 zeolite has a channel of 0.56 × 0.51 nm, a little larger than propane ( 0.47 nm)
[30]
, which might be good for propane adsorption. De Moor et al.
[31]
and Tranca et al.
[32]
have reported that the adsorption of propane in HZSM-5 zeolite was exothermic, where the adsorption of propane on Brnsted acid sites was much easier than propane adsorbed in the channels of HZSM-5 zeolite. In recent years, several studies have reported that metal species (such as ZnO, GaOx and MoOx) supported on HZSM-5 zeolites exhibited high catalytic activity for alkane dehydrogenation to olefin, however, the high acidity of HZSM-5 led to serious secondary reactions such as cracking and deep dehydrogenation
[33]
,
[34]
,
[35]
,
[36]
. The exploitation of an efficient PDH catalyst based on HZSM-5 zeolite to achieve both high selectivity and stability is still a great challenge.
In zeolite supported catalysts, zeolite is usually not an inert support, which can provide a special environment (e.g., channel confinement effects, acidic sites and electron transfer) for catalytic reactions. Especially, the acidic sites in zeolites play a key role in determining the catalytic performance of zeolite catalysts in alkane conversion
[34
,
37
,
38]
. Song et al.
[37]
found that the adjacent Brnsted acid sites in HZSM-5 zeolite displayed higher alkane cracking activity than isolated Brnsted acid site due to the presence of more positive intrinsic activation entropies at the adjacent Brnsted acid sites. Halsz et al.
[38]
reported that the dehydrogenation activity of Ga/HZSM-5 catalysts was associated with Lewis acid sites, while coking and cracking were related to Brnsted acid sites. Differently, a recent mechanism about Ga/HZSM-5 catalysts in alkane dehydrogenation reported by Lercher et al. that the LewisBrnsted acid pairs (originating from Ga species and HZSM-5 zeolite) on Ga/HZSM-5 catalysts could heterolytically activate the CH bond of alkane with a low intrinsic enthalpy barrier
[34]
. Up to now, the role of acid sites of metal-zeolite catalysts in alkane dehydrogenation has been still discussed controversially.
Here a series of CrOx catalysts supported on high-silica HZSM-5 zeolites were prepared and used for PDH, which exhibited high catalytic activity, good selectivity and excellent stability. The effect of Cr loading amount and SiO2/Al2O3 ratio on the catalytic performance of Cr/HZSM-5 catalysts was investigated in detail. For comparison, CrOx catalysts supported on commonly used supports (i.e., Al2O3 and SiO2) were synthesized for PDH, which exhibited much lower catalytic performance than Cr/HZSM-5(260). The role of Cr species and Brnsted acid sites in Cr/HZSM-5 catalysts was elucidated on the basis of the physicochemical characterizations, PDH tests and Na+ doping experiments.
2. Experimental
2.1. Catalyst preparation
Al2O3, SiO2 and HZSM-5 (SiO2/Al2O3 = 28, 43, 80 and 260) were provided by Tianjin Shenneng Sci-Tech Co., Ltd. NaNO3 and Cr(NO3)3·9H2O were purchased from Tianjin Guangfu Fine Chem. Co.
The supported CrOx catalysts were prepared by a wet-impregnation method. Briefly, the calculated Cr(NO3)3·9H2O was dissolved into 20 mL of deionized water, and 1 g of support (Al2O3, SiO2 and HZSM-5 zeolites) was added into the above solution. After stirring for 1 h, the mixture was dried at 80 C and subsequently calcined in a muffle furnace at 600 C for 4 h (heating rate, 5 C min1). The resultant catalysts were named as x%Cr/Al2O3, x%Cr/SiO2 and x%Cr/Z-5(y) (x represents the calculated Cr loading amount, y represents the SiO2/Al2O3 ratio), respectively.
Furthermore, 1 g of 5%Cr/Z-5(260) was added into 20 mL of deionized water with 37 mg of NaNO3 (Na content = 1 wt%). After stirring for 1 h, the mixture was dried at 80 C and then calcined in a muffle furnace at 600 C for 1 h. The corresponding samples were denoted as 5%Cr/Z-5(260) + 1%Na. NaZSM-5(260) zeolites were prepared from HZSM-5(260) by ion exchange with 50 mL of NaNO3 solution (1 M) per 1 g zeolite for three times. The 5%Cr/NaZ-5(260) catalysts were synthesized like 5%Cr/Z-5(260) sample. Furthermore, 5%Cr/Z-5(28) + 1%Na and 5%Cr/NaZ-5(28) catalysts were prepared as the same method to 5%Cr/Z-5(260) + 1%Na and 5%Cr/NaZ-5(260) samples. The used 5%Cr/Z-5(260) catalysts after a period time on stream were named as 5%Cr/Z-5(260)-z (z represents the reaction time).
2.2. Catalysts characterization
Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images were recorded on a Jeol JEM-2800 microscope at 200 kV. X-ray diffraction patterns (XRD) were obtained on a Rigaku Mini Flex II diffractometer. Therogravimetry analysis (TGA) was carried out on a TA SDT Q600 analyzer with α-Al2O3 as the reference in air atmosphere. The heating rate and air flowing rate are 10 C min1 and 100 mL min1, respectively.
Ammonia temperature-programed desorption (NH3-TPD) experiments were performed on a Quantachrome CHEMBET3000 analyzer with a thermal conductivity detector (TCD) analyzer. Before the tests, 0.2 g sample was degassed at 400 C for 30 min, and subsequently cooled down to room temperature. Afterwards, the dried samples were saturated with 5%NH3/Ar (20 mL min1) at 60 C. Then, the samples were purged by He until the baseline flat and subsequently heated to target temperature with a heating rate of 10 C min1. The signals of the desorbed compounds were detected by a TCD analyzer. Propane and propylene temperature-programed desorption (C3H8/C3H6-TPD) experiments were performed on a Quantachrome CHEMBET3000 analyzer with a TCD analyzer. Before the tests, 0.2 g sample was degassed at 550 C for 1 h and subsequently reduced in H2 atmosphere (580 C, 20 mL min1) for 0.5 h. After cooling down to 100 C, the dried samples were saturated with pure C3H8 (or C3H6). Then, the samples were purged by He and subsequently heated to target temperature with a heating rate of 10 C min1. The signals of the desorbed compounds were detected by a TCD analyzer. Propane pulse experiments were carried out on a Quantachrome CHEMBET3000 analyzer with a TCD analyzer. Before the tests, all the samples were desorbed at 550 C for 1 h and subsequently cooled down to 100 C. Then, 0.1 mL propane was injected into the sample for several times until saturated adsorption. The un-adsorbed propane was detected by a TCD analyzer.
N2 sorption analysis was performed at 77 K on a Quantachrome NOVA 2000e sorption analyzer. Before the test, all the samples were degassed in vacuum at 200 C for over 8 h. The specific surface area was estimated by BrunauerEmmettTeller (BET) method, and the pore volume was calculated at P/P0 = 0.99.
X-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS) were recorded on a Kratos Axis Ultra DLD (delay line detector) spectrometer equipped with an Al-Kα X-ray source (1486.6 eV). Each XPS spectrum was measured on an aperture slot 300 × 700 m and corrected by C 1s at 284.8 eV.
1H MAS NMR experiments were carried out on a Bruker AVC400 instrument (400.1 MHz, π/2 single pulse excitation) with repetition time of 10 s using a 2.5 mm MAS NMR probe (spinning rate, 25 kHz). Prior to the test, the sample was degassed at 500 C in He flowing for 4 h. Then, the degassed sample was transformed into a glovebox and loaded into a 2.5 mm MAS NMR probe under Ar atmosphere.
2.3. Propane dehydrogenation tests
All the PDH tests were performed in a quartz flow micro-reactor (5 mm i.d.). In a typical experiment, 0.2 g catalyst (sieve fraction 450  900 m) was loaded into the flat-temperature zone of the reactor. Then, the reactants (5% C3H8 and 95% N2) were fed (20 mL min1, weight hourly space velocity (WHSV) of 0.59 h1) through the catalyst. Afterwards, the reactor was heated to objective temperature and maintained for 10 min. The products were measured by an online gas chromatograph (SP-6890) equipped with an FID detector. Furthermore, 5%Cr/HZSM-5(260) was tested at a high WHSV of 5.9 h1 (10% C3H8 and 20% N2). The propane conversion and propylene selectivity are defined as follows:
(1)
(2)
The propylene formation rates (r) of the supported CrOx catalysts are calculated as follows:
(3)
The calculated apparent turn over frequencies (TOFs) of the supported CrOx catalysts are based on all the Cr atoms at propane conversion below 15%
[37]
.
(4)
The actual TOF values of the supported CrOx catalysts are calculated based on the exposed Cr atoms at propane conversion below 15%. Normally, the exposed Cr atoms were calculated by C3H8 pulse results
[26]
.
(5)
The absence of mass transfer effect on the reaction rate was checked by MadonBoudart tests
[39
,
40]
. Typically, Cr/Z-5(260) catalysts with different Cr loadings are synthesized and tested for PDH. Fig. S1 shows the linear relationship between the propane conversion rates and the exposed Cr amounts, showing an excellent liner relationship. This indicates the absence of internal diffusion limitations.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Catalytic performance of the supported CrOx catalysts
The catalytic tests over all the prepared CrOx-based catalysts for PDH are carried out at the same conditions. As shown in
Fig. 1
(a), 5%Cr/Z-5(260) exhibits comparable initial propylene formation rate to 5%Cr/Al2O3 catalyst. When the CrOx species are loaded on HZSM-5 with a low SiO2/Al2O3 ratio (SiO2/Al2O3 = 28, 43 and 80), the propylene formation rate decreases obviously. In particular, 5%Cr/Z-5(28) shows the lowest initial propylene formation rate of 2.0 mmol gcat1 h1. After 5 h time on stream, the propylene formation rates of 5%Cr/SiO2 and 5%Cr/Al2O3 decrease obviously. However, no obvious decrease of the propylene formation rates can be observed over the Cr/Z-5 catalysts. In particular, the propylene formation rate of 5%Cr/Z-5(260) increases from 5.6 to 6.1 mmol gcat1 h1 after 5 h time on stream.
Fig. 1
(b) shows the initial propylene formation rates of 5%Cr/Z-5 catalysts as a function of SiO2/Al2O3 ratio. Clearly, the propylene formation rates of 5%Cr/Z-5 catalysts increases with the increase of SiO2/Al2O3 ratio. This indicates that the SiO2/Al2O3 ratio of HZSM-5 plays an important role on determining the catalytic performance of Cr/Z-5 catalysts. Fig. S2 provides the detail catalytic performances (propane conversion, propylene selectivity and propylene yield) of 5%Cr/SiO2, 5%Cr/Al2O3 and 5%Cr/Z-5 catalysts (SiO2/Al2O3 = 28, 43, 80 and 260) as a function of time-on-stream. All the Cr/Z-5 catalysts exhibit much higher stability than 5%Cr/SiO2 and 5%Cr/Al2O3 catalysts. After 5 h time on stream, a high propylene yield of 45.2% can be maintained over the 5%Cr/Z-5(260) catalyst, which is much higher than that of 5%Cr/Al2O3 (25.5%), 5%Cr/SiO2 (9.6%), 5%Cr/Z-5(28) (14.3%), 5%Cr/Z-5(43) (21.5%) and 5%Cr/Z-5(80) (30.6%).

(b) Initial propylene formation rates of 5%Cr/Z-5 catalysts as a function of SiO2/Al2O3 ratio. (c) Initial propylene formation rates of Cr/Z-5(260) catalysts as a function of Cr loading amount. (d) Stability testing (propylene formation rates) of 5%Cr/Z-5(260) catalyst at WHSV of 0.59 and 5.9 h1 for 50 h time-on-stream. The tests in (ac) were performed at a WHSV of 0.59 h1.
To investigate the influence of Cr loading amounts on the catalytic performance of Cr/Z-5(260) catalysts, Cr/Z-5(260) samples with different Cr loading amounts are prepared and tested for PDH (
Figs. 1
c and S3). It is shown that the propylene formation rates of Cr/Z-5(260) catalysts exhibit a volcano type variation tendency (
Fig. 1
c). At low Cr loading amount of 1%3%, the propylene formation rates of Cr/Z-5(260) catalysts increase obviously with the increase of Cr loading amount. When the Cr loading is higher than 3% (i.e., 5% and 7%), only a slight increase of the propylene formation rate can be observed over the Cr/Z-5(260) catalyst. After further increase the Cr loading to 10%, an obvious decrease of the propylene formation rate can be seen.
Figs. 1
(d) and S4 show the stability testing of 5%Cr/Z-5(260) catalyst at different WHSV values. It is shown that the 5%Cr/Z-5(260) exhibits high catalytic performance and excellent stability toward PDH at various reaction conditions. At the WHSV of 5.9 h1, a high propylene formation rate of 27.9 mmol gcat1 h1 can be obtained over the 5%Cr/Z-5(260) catalyst after 50 h time-on-stream, demonstrating a very promising PDH catalyst. This result is much better than previous reported Pt- and CrOx-based catalysts. The detail comparisons are listed in Tables S1 and S2.
3.2. Structural and surface properties
The structural properties of the prepared CrOx catalysts are detected by N2 sorption technique (
Table 1
). It is shown that 5%Cr species supported on HZSM-5 zeolite with different SiO2/Al2O3 possess similar specific surface area, which are much larger than that of 5%Cr/Al2O3 and 5%Cr/SiO2 samples. As to Cr/Z-5(260) catalysts, their specific surface areas decrease with the increase of Cr contents, which is probably due to the Cr species blocking a number of nanopores and/or the decrease of zeolite in Cr/Z-5(260) catalyst
[41
,
42]
.
Fig. 2
shows the TEM and EDS elemental mapping images of Cr/Z-5(260) catalysts with different Cr loading amounts. As to 3%Cr/Z-5(260), no particles and aggregations can be observed on the surface of HZSM-5 zeolite (
Fig. 2
a-c). The corresponding EDS mapping images reveal that the Cr species are highly dispersed throughout the HZSM-5 zeolites at the nanoscale (
Fig. 2
c). For 5%Cr/Z-5(260) (
Fig. 2
df), its microtopography is similar to that of 3%Cr/Z-5(260). With the Cr loading amount increasing to 7%, some large particles can be clearly seen over the TEM and Cr mapping images (
Fig. 2
g and i). The high resolution TEM image of these particles possesses clear lattice fringes of 0.167 nm, corresponding to the (116) plane of rhombohedral Cr2O3 (
Fig. 2
h). This result illustrates that the Cr loading amount can affect the dispersion of Cr species.

The XRD patterns of parent HZSM-5(260) and Cr/Z-5(260) samples are very similar (
Fig. 3
a), indicating that the Cr loading makes little influence on the crystallite structure of HZSM-5 zeolite. Noticeably, a series of new diffraction peaks at 2θ = 33.6 and 41.5 can be observed over the partially enlarged XRD patterns of 5%  10%Cr/Z-5(260) catalysts, corresponding to the (104) and (113) crystallite planes of Cr2O3 (JCPDS No. 38-1479), respectively (
Fig. 3
b). This indicates the formation of crystallite Cr2O3 in Cr/Z-5(260) catalysts at high Cr loading, in good agreement with the TEM results (
Fig. 2
). The TEM images and XRD pattern of 5%Cr/Z-5(260) after 50 h time-on-stream are provided in Figs. S5 and S6, respectively, showing similar microtopography and crystal structure to that of fresh 5%Cr/Z-5(260) catalyst (
Figs. 2
and

). This indicates that the Cr/Z-5(260) catalysts possess high thermal stability during the PDH process.

The acidity properties of the prepared Cr/Z-5, Cr/SiO2 and Cr/Al2O3 catalysts are detected by NH3-TPD technique (
Figs. 4
and S7). As shown in
Fig. 4
(a), the NH3-TPD curves of parent HZSM-5(260) and Cr/Z-5(260) catalysts display an obvious signal in the temperature range of 50  600 C, which can be deconvoluted into three Gaussian peaks centered at around 130 160, 190  240 and 400  430 C, respectively, corresponding to the physically adsorbed NH3 (peak α), weakly acid sites (peak β) and strongly acid sites (peak γ), respectively
[43]
,
[44]
,
[45]
. It is notable that the areas of peak β and γ in Cr/Z-5 catalysts are a little larger than those in HZSM-5(260), which is probably due to the formation of some new Lewis acid sites (such as Crn+ sites)
[44
,

.

The metal-support interactions between Cr species and HZSM-5 support were measured by XPS spectroscopy (
Fig. 5
). As to bulk Cr2O3, four peaks can be observed in the Cr 2p XPS spectrum, corresponding to the Cr3+ 2p3/2 (576.8, 577.9 and 579.5 eV), and Cr3+ 2p1/2 (587.3 eV), respectively
[46
,
47]
. While only two obvious peaks can be seen in the 5%Cr/Z-5(28) and 5%Cr/Z-5(260), corresponding to the Cr6+ 2p3/2 (578.8 eV) and Cr6+ 2p1/2 (588.6 eV), respectively. The main Cr6+ species in 5%Cr/Z-5 catalysts must be due to the presence of strong interactions between Cr species and zeolite supports, such as the formation of Al-O-Cr and/or Si-O-Cr linkages

3.3. Coke formation
During the PDH tests, the high reaction temperature would result in coke formation onto the catalyst, which is the main cause of catalyst deactivation. In general, coke hinders the diffusion of reactants to the catalyst surface by blocking both pores and active sites
[50]
. So, the anti-coking capability of catalysts is very crucial for PDH catalysts. To quantify the coke content, 5%Cr/Z-5(260) catalysts after different reaction periods are tested by TG analysis. And the 5%Cr/Al2O3 sample after 5 h time on stream was also tested for comparison. As shown in
Fig. 6
, 5%Cr/Al2O3-5 h displays a weight loss of 5.7% from 300 to 600 C. However, 5%Cr/Z-5(260)5 h possesses a slight weight loss of 0.6%, indicating the formation of only a little coke. After 50 h time-on-stream, a weight loss of 5.8% can be detected over the 5%Cr/Z-5(260)50 h sample, which is comparable to that of 5%Cr/Al2O3-5 h (5.7%). This illustrates that the Cr/Z-5(260) catalyst system possesses strong anti-coking capability in PDH process, in good agreement with its excellent catalytic stability (
Fig. 1
).

Fig. 7. (a) C3H8-TPD and (b) C3H6-TPD curves of CrOx catalyst supported on different supports.
As shown in
Fig. 7
(a), all the Cr/Z-5 catalysts exhibit an obvious C3H8 desorbed signal in the temperature range of 150  500 C. In particular, the peak centers of Cr/Z-5 catalysts increase with the decrease of SiO2/Al2O3 ratio, i.e., the peak centers of Cr/Z-5(260), Cr/Z-5(80), Cr/Z-5(43) and Cr/Z-5(28) are 312, 320, 335 and 396 C, respectively. This indicates that the SiO2/Al2O3 ratio of HZSM-5 support can affect the interactions between propane and 5%Cr/Z-5 catalysts. For better understanding the role of HZSM-5 support, the HZSM-5(260) zeolite was tested by C3H8-TPD (Fig. S8). Interestingly, HZSM-5(260) possesses an obvious propane desorbed signal in the temperature range of 200  500 C, indicating the presence of a certain interaction between propane and HZSM-5 support. Many previous studies have reported that propane could be adsorbed onto the Brnsted acid sites of zeolite, which is very crucial for propane activation and conversion
[31

.
The C3H6-TPD results of 5%Cr/Z-5 catalysts with different SiO2/Al2O3 ratios are shown in
Fig. 7
(b). Obviously, the C3H6-TPD curves of 5%Cr/Z-5 catalysts can be fitted into three peaks centered at  270,  310 and  380 C respectively, corresponding to the weakly adsorbed propylene (peak I#), moderately adsorbed propylene (peak II#) and strongly adsorbed propylene species (peak III#), respectively
[53
,
54]
. Noticeably, the propane desorbed signals of Cr/Z-5 catalysts are strongly dependent on the SiO2/Al2O3 ratio of HZSM-5 supports. At high SiO2/Al2O3 ratio of 260, almost no strongly adsorbed propylene species (peak III#) can be seen over the 5%Cr/Z-5(260) catalyst. When the SiO2/Al2O3 decreases from 260 to 28, the intensity of peak III# increases obviously. Especially, the 5%Cr/Z-5(28) shows the strongest peak III#, indicating the presence of much stronger interactions between propylene and 5%Cr/Z-5(28) sample. This result also reveals that the Cr/Z-5 catalysts with lower SiO2/Al2O3 possess stronger interactions between propylene and Cr/Z-5 catalysts, further revealing the important role of Brnsted acid sites in Cr/Z-5 catalysts.
On the basis of C3H8/C3H6-TPD results, it can be found that Brnsted acid sites in zeolite are good for propane adsorption and activation, however, too high amount of Brnsted acid sites in zeolite would result in deep dehydrogenation, cracking and/or coke formation. Gong et al. have reported that the strongly adsorbed propylene upon catalyst would be deep dehydrogenated and/or cracked, which is negative for PDH process
[53
,
54]
. Also, Song et al. reported that the adjacent Brnsted acid sites in HZSM-5 zeolite (ZSM-5 with low SiO2/Al2O3 ratio) displayed higher alkane cracking activity than isolated Brnsted acid site due to the presence of more positive intrinsic activation entropies at the adjacent Brnsted acid sites
[37]
. So, HZSM-5 zeolite with suitable amount of acidic sites would be very crucial for Cr/Z-5 catalysts in PDH reaction. The detail discussion and experimental results are provided in

3.5. Discussion
In previous studies concerning PDH, a great challenge for Cr-based catalysts is the serious coke formation during the catalytic reaction
[1
,
4
,
5]
. For improving the catalytic stability, many novel materials (such as ZrO2, mesoporous SiO2 and nanocarbons) are used as supports for preparation of CrOx catalysts
[11
,
13
,
18
,
19]
. It is reported that CrZrO2 prepared by a coprecipitation method with 40 times lower Cr content exhibited comparable activity to commercial K-CrOx/Al2O3 in PDH reaction
[13]
. Furthermore, ordered mesoporous Cr-Zr-O and Cr-Zr-K-O catalysts were synthesized and used for PDH, exhibiting enhanced catalytic activity and stability
[19]
. For 120 min time on stream, the propylene yield of CrZr5 decreased from 46.8% to 5%. Also, Cr/SBA-15 and Cr/CMK-3 catalysts with highly ordered mesopores were prepared and used for PDH, which exhibited higher stability than Cr/Al2O3 catalysts
[11
,
18]
. Although many efficient Cr-based catalysts have been exploited for PDH, no obvious improvement of the catalytic stability was achieved.
3.5.1. The effect of Cr loading amount
Here CrOx species supported on high-silica HZSM-5(260) are prepared by a simple wet-impregnation method, which exhibit high activity, good selectivity and excellent stability for PDH. It is revealed that the Cr/Z-5(260) catalysts possess many advantages such as large porosity (as evidenced by N2 sorption), high dispersion (as evidenced by TEM and XRD), moderate acidity (as evidenced by NH3-TPD) and strong metal-support interactions (as evidenced by XPS). Especially, the Cr loading amounts can affect the dispersion of Cr species on Cr/Z-5(260) catalysts, affecting their catalytic performance toward PDH. In general, isolated and/or unsaturated Cr3+ species are reported as the active sites in Cr-based catalysts
[20
,
50
,
55]
.
For elucidating the intrinsic activity of Cr/Z-5(260) catalysts, we performed a series of PDH tests at the propane conversion below 15%, and the calculated TOF values based on all Cr atoms and actual TOF values based on the exposed Cr species as a function of Cr loading are shown in
Fig. 8
. Because the assumption of all Cr atoms is served as the active sites, the calculated TOFs of Cr/Z-5(260) catalysts with isolated and clustered Cr species would be close to actual TOF, while the Cr/Z-5(260) catalysts having crystallite Cr2O3 would possess lower calculated TOFs than actual TOFs due to the fact that the internal Cr species of Cr2O3 crystallites are inactive for dehydrogenation process
[56
,
57]
. As shown in
Fig. 8
(a), the calculated TOF values of Cr/Z-5(260) catalysts decrease with the increase of Cr loading from 1% to 10%. However, the actual TOF values of 1%  10%Cr/Z-5(260) are similar to each other (
Fig. 8
b). In particular, the calculated TOF value of 1%Cr/Z-5(260) is close to that of its actual TOF value, suggesting that almost all Cr atoms are the active sites in 1%Cr/Z-5(260) catalyst. As evidenced by TEM images (
Fig. 2
) and XRD patterns (
Fig. 3
), most of the Cr species are highly dispersed onto the HZSM-5 at low Cr loading amount. As increasing the Cr loading, bulk Cr2O3 particles would be formed in 3%  10%Cr/Z-5(260) catalysts. So, a number of active sites would be covered by bulk Cr2O3 crystallite, resulting in the decrease of calculated TOF values. This further indicates that highly dispersed Cr species are the active sites in PDH process.

3.5.2. The effect of SiO2/Al2O3 ratio of HZSM-5 support
In alkane dehydrogenation reaction, the well-known HoriutiPolanyi mechanism suggests that alkane dehydrogenation consists four main steps: (a) Dissociative adsorption of the alkane, (b) CH cleavage, (c) hydrogen molecule formation, and (d) olefin and hydrogen desorption
[1
,

,
58
,
59]
. Also, Copret group reported that PDH process on Cr-SiO2 catalyst follows: (1) The formation of Cr(III)-C3H8 species, (2) Heterolytic activation of the CH bond of Cr(III)-C3H8 results in a Cr(III)-C3H7 intermediate, (3) The Cr(III)-C3H7 intermediate undergoes β-H elimination to form a Cr(III)-C3H6 hydride surface specie, (4) Propene release and Cr-H species were formed, (5) H2 was released by proton transferring, completing the reaction cycle
[50
,
51]
. During the PDH process, the dissociative adsorption of propane (formation of Cr(III)-C3H8 species) and the heterolytic activation of the CH bond of Cr(III)-C3H8 are very crucial for Cr-based catalysts, which can significantly affect their PDH performance.
On the basis of C3H8-TPD analysis (
Fig. 7
a), it can be seen that the Cr/Z-5 samples possess strong interactions to propane. So, propane molecules could be adsorbed onto the catalyst surface, forming C3H8-S species (S represents the surface of catalysts)
[1
,
54
,
58
,
59]
. Subsequently, the adsorbed propane could be activated and reacted by the activated sites
[1
,
53
,
54]
. However, 5%Cr/SiO2 catalyst possesses almost no propane desorption signal (Fig. S9), indicating the presence of very weak interactions between propane and 5%Cr/SiO2 catalyst. So, the propane molecular is hard to active on 5%Cr/SiO2 catalyst. In Fig. S2, 5%Cr/SiO2 exhibits much lower catalytic activity than 5%Cr/Z-5 catalysts, in good accordance with the C3H8-TPD results.
Additionally, the propylene desorption property can also affect the selectivity, stability and anti-coking capability of PDH catalysts due to the fact that the strongly adsorbed propylene would be deep dehydrogenated, cracked and/or polymerized
[1
,
9]
. In particular, the polymerization reaction would lead to coke formation onto the catalysts, which can cover the active sites and result in catalyst deactivation
[1
,

[10]

[11]

[13]
. As shown in
Figs. 7
(b) and S9, the C3H6-TPD curves of 5%Cr/Z-5(28) display a very strong propylene desorbed peak in the high temperature range of 450  600 C (peak 2#), revealing the presence of many strongly adsorbed propylene molecules. So, the product propylene cannot be easily desorbed, which would result in cracking, deep dehydrogenation and/or coke formation. With increasing SiO2/Al2O3 ratio of HZSM-5 zeolite, the strongly adsorbed propylene decreases obviously. In particular, almost no strongly adsorbed propylene peak can be seen over the 5%Cr/Z-5(260), indicating the presence of weak interactions between propylene molecular and 5%Cr/Z-5(260) catalyst (
Fig. 7
b). Thus, the product propylene formed on Cr/Z-5(260) catalysts can be easily desorbed during the PDH process, guaranteeing high catalytic activity, selectivity and stability.
As shown in
Fig. 1
(a and b), it can be found that the catalytic performances of Cr/Z-5 catalysts are strongly dependent on the SiO2/Al2O3 ratio of ZSM-5 support. The NH3-TPD curves of 5%Cr/Z-5 catalysts (SiO2/Al2O3 = 28, 43, 80 and 260) have revealed that the acidity of 5%Cr/Z-5 catalysts decreases with the increase of SiO2/Al2O3 ratio (
Fig. 4
and Table S3). To better understand the acidity of Cr/Z-5 in PDH process, the relationships between the ammonia desorption amounts and propane conversion, propylene selectivity and propylene yield are shown in
Fig. 9
. The propane conversions of Cr/Z-5 catalysts improve with the increase of the amount of acidic sites, while their propylene selectivity and yield decrease with the increase of the amount of acidic sites, in well accordance with the trends in
Fig. 1
(b). This indicates that the high amounts of acidic sites of HZSM-5 zeolites are negative for PDH reaction. Only HZSM-5 zeolite has suitable acidic sites that can be used as a good support for CrOx catalysts for PDH process.

3.5.3. The important role of acidic sites
To further understand the acidic sites of Cr/Z-5 catalysts, here we designed a series of Na+ doping experiments according to previous studies
[60]
,
[61]
,
[62]
. Typically, ZSM-5 zeolites with controlled Na+ contents were prepared and used as supports for CrOx catalysts (i.e., 5%Cr/Z-5(260) + 1%Na and 5%Cr/NaZ-5(260) (Na content  2.3%) catalysts). As shown in
Fig. 10
(a), the NH3-TPD curves of 5%Cr/Z-5(260) decrease with the increase of Na doping, indicating the decrease of acidity.
Fig. 10
(b) shows the 1H MAS NMR spectra of 5%Cr/Z-5(260) before and after Na+ doping. The 5%Cr/Z-5(260) sample possesses three peaks at 4.5, 2.6 and 1.2 ppm, which can be assigned to the bridging hydroxyl Si(OH)Al groups (4.5 ppm), hydroxyl groups bonded to Al species (2.6 ppm) and silanol groups at framework defects (1.2 ppm), respectively
[63
,
64]
. With Na+ doping, the 1H MAS NMR peaks of 5%Cr/Z-5(260) at 4.5 ppm decrease obviously, indicating the decrease of Brnsted acid sites. The influence of Na+ doping on the propane adsorption properties of 5%Cr/Z-5(260) catalysts was evaluated by C3H8-TPD (
Fig. 10
c). It is notable that the C3H8-TPD signal of 5%Cr/Z-5(260) decreases obviously after Na+ doping, revealing that the Brnsted acid sites in HZSM-5 support play an important role in determining the propane adsorption process.
Fig. 10
(d) provides the PDH results of 5%Cr/Z-5(260) before and after Na+ doping at the reaction temperature of 580 C. The activity of 5%Cr/Z-5(260) decreases obviously with the increase of Na doping. Especially, the 5%Cr/NaZ-5(260) displays a very low propane conversion of 1.9%. Fig. S10 shows the PDH results of 5%Cr/Z-5(28) before and after Na+ doping, showing similar trend to that of 5%Cr/Z-5(260) catalysts (
Fig. 10
d). This illustrates that the Brnsted acid sites play an important role in determining the catalytic performance of Cr/Z-5 catalyst system. In Fig. S11, we proposed two possible processes for propane adsorbed on HZSM-5 and NaZSM-5. Typically, the propane molecules would be adsorbed and activated on the Brnsted acid sites in HZSM-5, whereas, the NaZSM-5 with almost no Brnsted acid sites processes very few propane adsorption. Thus, propane molecules on Cr/NaZSM-5 catalysts cannot be activated by the active CrOx species.

On the basis of above characterizations and analysis, it can be concluded that the Brnsted acid sites in HZSM-5 zeolite can significantly affect the propane adsorption and propylene desorption processes, and thus, affecting the catalytic performance of Cr/Z-5 catalysts in PDH. In particular, HZSM-5 zeolite with suitable acidic sites (Brnsted acid sites) is good for propane adsorption and propylene desorption, guaranteeing high PDH performance. However, too large amount of acidic sites of HZSM-5 would result in serious cracking and deep dehydrogenation of propane, which is negative for PDH process.
4. Conclusions
An efficient and highly stable PDH catalyst system of Cr species supported on high-silica HZSM-5 zeolite (SiO2/Al2O3 = 260) has been exploited by a simple wet-impregnation method. The resulting Cr/Z-5(260) catalysts possess many advantages such as large porosity, high dispersion, suitable amount of acidic sites and strong metal-support interactions, which exhibit high activity, good selectivity and excellent stability for PDH reaction. Characterization results, PDH tests and Na+ doping experiments demonstrate that Lewis and Brnsted acid sites (originating from Cr species and HZSM-5 zeolites) are responsible for the high catalytic performance. In particular, the Brnsted acid sites (Si(OH)Al) in HZSM-5(260) play a key role in propane adsorption and activation, affecting their catalytic performance. Furthermore, the SiO2/Al2O3 ratio of HZSM-5 can significantly affect the catalytic performance of Cr/Z-5 catalysts. The Cr species supported on HZSM-5 with low SiO2/Al2O3 ratio (i.e., SiO2/Al2O3 = 28, 43 and 80) possess low propylene selectivity during the PDH, due to the high amount of acidic sites of HZSM-5 support resulting in deep dehydrogenation and cracking of propane. By optimization of preparation conditions, 5 wt% Cr supported on HZSM-5(260) exhibits the best catalytic performance, with a high propylene formation rate of 27.9 mmol gcat1 h1 after 50 h time-on-stream at a high WHSV of 5.9 h1. This study may provide an important instruction to design and synthesize stable dehydrogenation catalysts with high activity and selectivity.
