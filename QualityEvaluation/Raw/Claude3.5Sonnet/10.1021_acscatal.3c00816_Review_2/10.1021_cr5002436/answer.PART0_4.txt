[1] "Xu et al. reported that in the absence of an oxidizing agent, the conversion obtained using Ga2O3 supported on ZrO2, Al2O3, and TiO2 was high, medium, and low, respectively, while SiO2 and MgO-supported Ga2O3 were inactive in alkane dehydrogenation."

[2] "Different carriers have been used in gallium oxide-based dehydrogenation catalysts, the inclusion of acid and basic sites on the support being important to achieve a high conversion."

[3] "Xu et al. reported dehydrogenation activity on both Lewis and Brnsted acid sites on GaO3/H-ZSM-5. A zeolitic support displaying a low concentration of medium and strong acid sites and a relatively high concentration of weak acid sites was found to lead to the most active and stable catalyst."

[4] "Work on the promotion of GaOx-based dehydrogenation catalysts appears to be limited, although a patent by Iezzi et al. claims that a catalyst comprising 1.2 wt % Ga2O3, <99 ppm of Pt, and 1.6 wt % of SiO2 on an Al2O3 support represents a highly active formulation in the dehydrogenation reaction."

The literature does not provide comprehensive information on the primary synthesis methods for metal-zeolite catalysts used in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. It also does not specifically explain why MFI and BEA topological zeolites dominate in this application. However, based on the available information, we can infer some insights about PDH catalyst design:

1. Support material is crucial for catalyst performance. Different supports like ZrO2, Al2O3, TiO2, SiO2, and MgO have been tested for Ga2O3-based catalysts, with varying results.

2. The acidity of the support plays a significant role. Both Lewis and Brønsted acid sites contribute to dehydrogenation activity.

3. For zeolitic supports, a low concentration of medium and strong acid sites combined with a high concentration of weak acid sites leads to the most active and stable catalysts.

4. Promoters and additional components can enhance catalyst performance. For example, a patent describes a highly active PDH catalyst comprising Ga2O3, trace amounts of Pt, and SiO2 on an Al2O3 support.

These factors suggest that MFI and BEA zeolites may be preferred due to their ability to provide an optimal balance of acid site types and strengths, as well as their structural characteristics that allow for efficient diffusion of reactants and products. Future developments in PDH catalyst design may focus on fine-tuning the acidity of zeolite supports, incorporating promoters, and optimizing the interaction between the active metal species and the support.

文献并未提供关于丙烷脱氢(PDH)反应中使用的金属-沸石催化剂的主要合成方法的全面信息。它也没有具体解释为什么MFI和BEA拓扑结构的沸石在这一应用中占主导地位。然而，根据可用信息，我们可以推断出一些关于PDH催化剂设计的见解：

1. 载体材料对催化剂性能至关重要。已经对Ga2O3基催化剂测试了不同的载体，如ZrO2、Al2O3、TiO2、SiO2和MgO，结果各不相同。

2. 载体的酸性起着重要作用。路易斯酸位和布朗斯特酸位都对脱氢活性有贡献。

3. 对于沸石载体，中强酸位浓度低而弱酸位浓度高的组合可以产生最活跃和稳定的催化剂。

4. 助剂和其他组分可以增强催化剂性能。例如，一项专利描述了一种高活性PDH催化剂，由Ga2O3、微量Pt和SiO2在Al2O3载体上组成。

这些因素表明，MFI和BEA沸石可能因其能够提供酸位类型和强度的最佳平衡，以及允许反应物和产物高效扩散的结构特征而受到青睐。未来PDH催化剂设计的发展可能会集中在微调沸石载体的酸性、引入助剂以及优化活性金属物种与载体之间的相互作用。
