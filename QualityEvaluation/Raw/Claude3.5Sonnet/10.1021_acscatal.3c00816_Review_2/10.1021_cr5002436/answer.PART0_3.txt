[1] "Xu et al. reported that in the absence of an oxidizing agent, the conversion obtained using Ga2O3 supported on ZrO2, Al2O3, and TiO2 was high, medium, and low, respectively, while SiO2 and MgO-supported Ga2O3 were inactive in alkane dehydrogenation."

[2] "Albeit all of the noble metals of group VIIIB are active in the nonoxidative hydrogenation of alkanes, Pt is the only noble metal utilized in commercial applications due to its superior activation of paraffinic CH bonds and low activity to CC cleavage."

[3] "For example, Fujdala and Tilley have reported the use of a cothermolysis method involving several thermolytic molecular precursors to produce a Cr/Si/Zr/O catalyst capable of showing propane conversions greater than 35% and propylene selectivities exceeding 90% at 450 C."

[4] "Far below the theoretical monolayer coverage isolated vanadium species are present, at intermediate surface coverage polymeric species or sheets of vanadium oxide are favored, and above monolayer coverage V2O5 crystallites become dominant."

The literature does not provide specific information about the primary synthesis methods for metal-zeolite catalysts used in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions or why MFI and BEA topological zeolites dominate in this application. The document focuses more on other types of catalysts like platinum, chromium oxide, and gallium oxide supported on various oxides. It does not discuss the structural characteristics of MFI and BEA zeolites or their effectiveness in PDH reactions.

However, based on the information provided about other catalysts, we can infer some general principles that might apply to zeolite catalysts as well:

1. Support material is crucial: Different supports (ZrO2, Al2O3, TiO2, SiO2, MgO) significantly affect catalyst performance in PDH reactions.

2. Metal dispersion is important: The literature mentions isolated species, polymeric species, and crystallites for vanadium oxide catalysts, suggesting that metal dispersion affects catalytic properties.

3. Synthesis method impacts performance: The cothermolysis method mentioned for Cr/Si/Zr/O catalysts demonstrates that novel synthesis techniques can lead to improved catalytic performance.

4. Acidity plays a role: The document mentions acid sites in several contexts, suggesting that the acidity of the support material (which zeolites can provide) may be important for PDH catalysts.

For future developments in PDH catalyst design, these principles suggest that researchers should focus on optimizing metal dispersion within zeolite structures, controlling acidity, and exploring novel synthesis methods to enhance catalyst performance. However, without specific information about MFI and BEA zeolites in the context of PDH reactions, it's difficult to draw more precise conclusions about their dominance or future developments.

文献没有提供关于用于丙烷脱氢(PDH)反应的金属-沸石催化剂的主要合成方法的具体信息，也没有说明为什么MFI和BEA拓扑结构的沸石在这种应用中占主导地位。文档更多地关注其他类型的催化剂，如铂、氧化铬和氧化镓等负载在各种氧化物上的催化剂。它没有讨论MFI和BEA沸石的结构特征或它们在PDH反应中的有效性。

然而，根据提供的关于其他催化剂的信息，我们可以推断一些可能也适用于沸石催化剂的一般原则：

1. 载体材料至关重要：不同的载体（ZrO2、Al2O3、TiO2、SiO2、MgO）显著影响PDH反应中催化剂的性能。

2. 金属分散度很重要：文献提到了钒氧化物催化剂的孤立物种、聚合物种和晶体，表明金属分散度影响催化性能。

3. 合成方法影响性能：文献提到的Cr/Si/Zr/O催化剂的共热解方法表明，新型合成技术可以带来改进的催化性能。

4. 酸性起作用：文档在几个背景下提到了酸性位点，表明载体材料的酸性（沸石可以提供）可能对PDH催化剂很重要。

对于PDH催化剂设计的未来发展，这些原则表明研究人员应该专注于优化沸石结构内的金属分散度，控制酸性，并探索新的合成方法以增强催化剂性能。然而，由于缺乏关于MFI和BEA沸石在PDH反应背景下的具体信息，很难对它们的主导地位或未来发展得出更精确的结论。
