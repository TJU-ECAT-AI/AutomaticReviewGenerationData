[1] "Xu et al. reported that in the absence of an oxidizing agent, the conversion obtained using Ga2O3 supported on ZrO2, Al2O3, and TiO2 was high, medium, and low, respectively, while SiO2 and MgO-supported Ga2O3 were inactive in alkane dehydrogenation."

[2] "Notably, the structure of the support is also important, as a mesoporous GaAl mixed oxide exhibited an increased resistance to catalyst coking."

[3] "Xu et al. found that a zeolitic support displaying a low concentration of medium and strong acid sites and a relatively high concentration of weak acid sites was found to lead to the most active and stable catalyst."

[4] "Several authors claim that two-dimensional polymeric V3+ or V4+ species are the most active for dehydrogenation, the vanadium species bonded directly with the γ/θ-alumina support being the most active sites in PDH."

The literature does not provide specific details on the primary synthesis methods for metal-zeolite catalysts used in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. It also does not explain why MFI and BEA topological zeolites dominate in this application. 

However, the document does provide some insights into factors that contribute to catalyst effectiveness in PDH reactions:

1. Support material: The choice of support material significantly affects catalyst performance. Ga2O3 supported on ZrO2, Al2O3, and TiO2 showed varying levels of conversion, while SiO2 and MgO supports were inactive.

2. Porosity: Mesoporous structures, such as in GaAl mixed oxides, can increase resistance to catalyst coking, which is a major issue in PDH reactions.

3. Acidity: Zeolitic supports with a low concentration of medium and strong acid sites, but a high concentration of weak acid sites, lead to more active and stable catalysts.

4. Metal-support interaction: For some catalysts, such as vanadium-based ones, the species directly bonded to the support (e.g., γ/θ-alumina) are the most active sites for PDH.

These factors suggest that future developments in PDH catalyst design should focus on:

1. Optimizing support materials and their interactions with active metal species.
2. Developing mesoporous structures to enhance coking resistance.
3. Tailoring the acidity of zeolitic supports to balance activity and stability.
4. Investigating novel metal-support combinations to maximize the number of active sites.

While the document doesn't specifically address MFI and BEA zeolites, their popularity in PDH applications may be related to their ability to meet these criteria, particularly in terms of pore structure and acidity control.

文献没有提供用于丙烷脱氢(PDH)反应的金属-沸石催化剂的主要合成方法的具体细节。它也没有解释为什么MFI和BEA拓扑结构的沸石在这一应用中占主导地位。

然而，该文件确实提供了一些关于影响PDH反应中催化剂有效性的因素的见解：

1. 载体材料：载体材料的选择显著影响催化剂性能。在ZrO2、Al2O3和TiO2上负载的Ga2O3显示出不同程度的转化率，而SiO2和MgO载体则不活跃。

2. 孔隙度：介孔结构，如GaAl混合氧化物中的结构，可以增加对催化剂结焦的抗性，这是PDH反应中的一个主要问题。

3. 酸度：具有低浓度中强酸位和高浓度弱酸位的沸石载体可导致更活跃和稳定的催化剂。

4. 金属-载体相互作用：对于某些催化剂，如钒基催化剂，直接与载体（如γ/θ-氧化铝）结合的物种是PDH最活跃的位点。

这些因素表明，PDH催化剂设计的未来发展应关注：

1. 优化载体材料及其与活性金属物种的相互作用。
2. 开发介孔结构以增强抗结焦能力。
3. 调整沸石载体的酸度，以平衡活性和稳定性。
4. 研究新型金属-载体组合，以最大化活性位点数量。

虽然文档没有具体提到MFI和BEA沸石，但它们在PDH应用中的普及可能与它们满足这些标准的能力有关，特别是在孔结构和酸度控制方面。
