The primary synthesis methods for metal-zeolite catalysts used in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions include hydrothermal synthesis and isomorphous substitution. ZSM-5 (MFI topology) is highlighted as a dominant zeolite in PDH applications due to its unique physical properties that make it suitable as a catalyst carrier.

The effectiveness of MFI zeolites in PDH reactions can be attributed to their structural characteristics, such as their pore size and shape, which allow for selective reactions. Additionally, these zeolites can be modified through isomorphous substitution of Al or Si with other atoms, creating new physicochemical properties that enhance catalytic performance.

The incorporation of metal species into the zeolite matrix is noted as an effective way to create more active centers and improve catalyst stability. This approach allows for better dispersion of active metals and stronger metal-support interactions, which are crucial for PDH reactions.

Future developments in PDH catalyst design may focus on further optimizing the incorporation of metals and other elements into MFI and BEA zeolites to enhance their catalytic properties. This could involve exploring new synthesis methods, investigating the effects of different metal combinations, and fine-tuning the zeolite structure to improve selectivity and stability in PDH reactions.

用于丙烷脱氢(PDH)反应的金属-沸石催化剂的主要合成方法包括水热合成和同构替代。ZSM-5（MFI拓扑结构）因其独特的物理性质而被强调为PDH应用中占主导地位的沸石，使其适合作为催化剂载体。

MFI沸石在PDH反应中的有效性可归因于其结构特征，如孔径和形状，这些特征允许选择性反应发生。此外，这些沸石可以通过将Al或Si与其他原子进行同构替代来进行修饰，创造出新的物理化学性质，从而增强催化性能。

将金属物种掺入沸石基质被认为是创造更多活性中心和提高催化剂稳定性的有效方法。这种方法允许活性金属更好地分散，并增强金属-载体之间的相互作用，这对PDH反应至关重要。

PDH催化剂设计的未来发展可能集中于进一步优化金属和其他元素在MFI和BEA沸石中的掺入，以增强其催化性能。这可能涉及探索新的合成方法，研究不同金属组合的效果，以及微调沸石结构以提高PDH反应中的选择性和稳定性。
