The primary synthesis method for metal-zeolite catalysts used in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions mentioned in this study is incipient wetness impregnation. The document does not explicitly explain why MFI (ZSM-5) and BEA (Beta) topological zeolites dominate in PDH applications, but it does provide insights into their effectiveness.

The structural characteristics contributing to the effectiveness of MFI and BEA zeolites include their microporous nature and smaller pore sizes compared to mesoporous materials like SBA-15. The study shows that catalytic activity for propane dehydrogenation decreases with increasing pore size, with Pt-ZSM-5 showing the highest propane conversion, followed by Pt-Beta and then Pt-SBA-15.

The three-dimensional microporous structure of zeolites like ZSM-5 and Beta appears to induce optimal catalytic properties of Pt sites. This suggests that the confined space within the micropores may create a favorable environment for the PDH reaction, possibly by influencing the electronic state of the Pt or by affecting the adsorption and diffusion of reactants and products.

For future developments in PDH catalyst design, these findings imply that focusing on three-dimensional microporous materials with optimized pore sizes could lead to more effective catalysts. Further research could explore fine-tuning the pore geometry and size distribution to balance activity, selectivity, and stability in PDH reactions.

本研究中提到的用于丙烷脱氢(PDH)反应的金属-沸石催化剂的主要合成方法是浸渍法。虽然文献并未明确解释为什么MFI (ZSM-5)和BEA (Beta)拓扑结构的沸石在PDH应用中占主导地位，但它确实提供了关于它们有效性的见解。

MFI和BEA沸石的结构特征对其有效性的贡献包括它们的微孔性质以及与介孔材料（如SBA-15）相比较小的孔径。研究表明，丙烷脱氢的催化活性随着孔径的增大而降低，其中Pt-ZSM-5显示出最高的丙烷转化率，其次是Pt-Beta，然后是Pt-SBA-15。

像ZSM-5和Beta这样的沸石的三维微孔结构似乎能诱导Pt位点的最佳催化特性。这表明微孔内的受限空间可能为PDH反应创造了有利环境，可能是通过影响Pt的电子状态或影响反应物和产物的吸附和扩散。

对于PDH催化剂设计的未来发展，这些发现意味着关注具有优化孔径的三维微孔材料可能会导致更有效的催化剂。进一步的研究可以探索微调孔隙几何结构和尺寸分布，以平衡PDH反应中的活性、选择性和稳定性。
