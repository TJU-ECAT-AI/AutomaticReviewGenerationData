The primary synthesis method for metal-zeolite catalysts used in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions, as mentioned in the literature, is incipient wetness impregnation. The study focuses on ZSM-5 (MFI topology) and Beta (BEA topology) zeolites, which are indeed dominant in PDH applications.

These zeolites are effective due to their structural characteristics, particularly their pore geometry. The literature indicates that catalytic activity decreases with increasing pore size, with ZSM-5 showing the highest propane conversion, followed by Beta and then SBA-15 (a mesoporous material). This suggests that the microporous nature of MFI and BEA zeolites contributes significantly to their effectiveness in PDH reactions.

The three-dimensional microporous structure of these zeolites appears to induce optimal catalytic properties of platinum sites. This intrinsic nature of the microporous materials makes them better catalytic supports for dehydrogenation of propane compared to mesoporous materials like SBA-15.

For future developments in PDH catalyst design, these findings imply that focus should be maintained on optimizing microporous structures, particularly those with smaller pore sizes like ZSM-5. However, it's important to note that while smaller pores lead to higher activity, they may also contribute to increased coking, as evidenced by the higher coke formation on Pt-ZSM-5. Therefore, future research might aim to balance pore size for optimal activity while minimizing coke formation to improve catalyst stability and longevity.

文献中提到的丙烷脱氢(PDH)反应中使用的金属-沸石催化剂的主要合成方法是浸渍法。研究重点关注ZSM-5(MFI拓扑结构)和Beta(BEA拓扑结构)沸石，这两种沸石确实在PDH应用中占主导地位。

这些沸石之所以有效，是由于它们的结构特征，特别是孔道几何结构。文献表明，催化活性随着孔径的增大而降低，ZSM-5显示出最高的丙烷转化率，其次是Beta，然后是SBA-15(一种介孔材料)。这表明MFI和BEA沸石的微孔性质对PDH反应的有效性贡献显著。

这些沸石的三维微孔结构似乎能够诱导铂位点的最佳催化性能。微孔材料的这种本质特性使它们成为比SBA-15等介孔材料更好的丙烷脱氢催化剂载体。

对于PDH催化剂设计的未来发展，这些发现意味着应该继续关注微孔结构的优化，特别是像ZSM-5这样具有较小孔径的结构。然而，需要注意的是，虽然较小的孔径导致更高的活性，但它们也可能导致更多的积碳，这从Pt-ZSM-5上更高的积碳形成可以看出。因此，未来的研究可能会致力于平衡孔径大小，以获得最佳活性，同时最小化积碳形成，从而提高催化剂的稳定性和寿命。
