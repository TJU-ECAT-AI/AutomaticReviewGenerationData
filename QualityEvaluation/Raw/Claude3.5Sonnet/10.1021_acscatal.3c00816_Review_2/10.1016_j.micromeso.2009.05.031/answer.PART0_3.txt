The primary synthesis method for metal-zeolite catalysts used in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions, as mentioned in the literature, is incipient wetness impregnation. While the document does not explicitly state why MFI (ZSM-5) and BEA (Beta) topological zeolites dominate in PDH applications, it does provide insights into their effectiveness.

The structural characteristics contributing to the effectiveness of MFI and BEA zeolites include their microporous nature and three-dimensional structure. These features appear to induce optimal catalytic properties for platinum sites. The smaller pore size of ZSM-5 and Beta compared to mesoporous SBA-15 correlates with higher propane conversion, suggesting that the confined space in microporous materials enhances catalytic activity.

The literature indicates that catalytic activity decreases with increasing pore size in the order ZSM-5 > Beta > SBA-15. This trend implies that the microporous structure of MFI and BEA zeolites provides a more favorable environment for PDH reactions compared to mesoporous materials.

For future developments in PDH catalyst design, these findings suggest that focusing on three-dimensional microporous materials with optimized pore geometries could lead to more effective catalysts. The challenge would be to balance the benefits of confined spaces with the need to minimize coke formation, which was observed to be higher in ZSM-5 compared to Beta. Further research into tailoring pore structures and sizes within the microporous range could potentially yield catalysts with improved activity, selectivity, and stability for PDH reactions.

文献中提到的用于丙烷脱氢(PDH)反应的金属-沸石催化剂的主要合成方法是浸渍法。虽然文献没有明确说明为什么MFI（ZSM-5）和BEA（Beta）拓扑结构的沸石在PDH应用中占主导地位，但它确实提供了关于它们有效性的见解。

MFI和BEA沸石的结构特征对其有效性的贡献包括它们的微孔性质和三维结构。这些特征似乎能够诱导铂位点的最佳催化性能。与介孔SBA-15相比，ZSM-5和Beta的较小孔径与更高的丙烷转化率相关，这表明微孔材料中的受限空间增强了催化活性。

文献指出，催化活性随着孔径的增大而降低，顺序为ZSM-5 > Beta > SBA-15。这一趋势意味着MFI和BEA沸石的微孔结构为PDH反应提供了比介孔材料更有利的环境。

对于PDH催化剂设计的未来发展，这些发现表明，专注于具有优化孔隙几何结构的三维微孔材料可能会导致更有效的催化剂。挑战在于平衡受限空间的优势与最小化积碳形成的需求，因为观察到ZSM-5的积碳形成比Beta更高。进一步研究在微孔范围内定制孔结构和尺寸可能会产生具有改进的活性、选择性和稳定性的PDH反应催化剂。
