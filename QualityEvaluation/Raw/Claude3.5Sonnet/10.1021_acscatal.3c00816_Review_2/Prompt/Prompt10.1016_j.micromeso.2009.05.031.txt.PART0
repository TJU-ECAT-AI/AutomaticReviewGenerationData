I'm going to give you a scientific literature. Then I'm going to ask you some questions about it. I'd like you to first write down exact quotes of parts of the document word by word that would help answer the question, and then I'd like you to answer the question using facts from the quoted content. Do not omit any relevant information from the text, and avoid introducing any falsehoods or assumptions that aren't directly supported by the literature. Here is the literature, in <literature></literature> XML tags:

Abstract
The influence of the pore geometry of the catalyst supports on dehydrogenation of propane (DHP) activity, selectivity to propylene and the degree of coke formation was evaluated over micro-(Pt-ZSM-5 and Pt-Beta) and meso-(Pt-SBA-15) porous materials in a tapered element oscillating microbalance (TEOM) reactor by analyzing reaction products and mass changes simultaneously. The catalysts were prepared by incipient wetness impregnation and were characterized by N2-physisorption, X-ray diffraction (XRD) and H2-chemisorption. The characterization results indicate that catalysts contain Pt within the pores and Pt nanoparticles of more or less similar sizes however stabilized on markedly different pore geometries (structure and size). This allowed to (i) largely marginalize the effect of the sizes of Pt particles on DHP and (ii) evaluate exclusively the vital role of pore geometry of the supports, where a fraction of Pt is located within the pores, on the catalytic performance. Pt-ZSM-5 presents the highest propane conversion followed by Pt-Beta and Pt-SBA-15 indicating that the activity decreases with increasing pore size (ZSM-5 < Beta < SBA-15) of the support. TEOM results evidence that the amount of coke formed during DHP is the highest on Pt-ZSM-5 and is the lowest on Pt-Beta thus, the latter exhibits better catalytic stability than the former and Pt-SBA-15. Among Pt-ZSM-5 and Pt-SBA-15, the former shows better selectivity and stability than the latter despite higher coke content. These observations demonstrate that the three dimensional microporous materials are better catalytic supports for DHP than the mesoporous SBA-15 because of their intrinsic nature that may induce optimum catalytic properties of Pt sites.

Here are the question lists, in <questions></questions>XML tags:
<questions>


Analyze the primary synthesis methods for metal-zeolite catalysts used in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions, explaining why MFI and BEA topological zeolites dominate in this application. How do their structural characteristics and other factors contribute to their effectiveness, and what are the implications for future developments in PDH catalyst design?

First, you need to sequentially extract any quotes in the literature that are most relevant to each question, and print them in numbered order, separated by newlines. Quotes should be relatively brief. Do not attempt to summarize or answer questions at this stage, but simply repeat exactly what the corresponding part of the literature says.

Please enclose the full list of quotes in <quotes></quotes> XML tags. If there are no relevant quotes, write "No relevant quotes" instead.

Then, answer the question, starting with "Answer:".  Do not include or reference quoted content verbatim in the answer. Don't say "According to Quote [1]" when answering. Do not write reference number of quotes after answer. Put your answer to the user inside <EnglishVersionAnswer></EnglishVersionAnswer> XML tags. Output formatted text, with line breaks for each question.Separate quotes and answers with a blank line. Provide the answers to all questions in English. After completing the English answers, translate all those answers into Chinese and provide the Chinese version inside <ChineseVersionAnswer></ChineseVersionAnswer> XML tags.

Thus, the format of your overall response should look like what's shown between the <example></example> tags.  Make sure to follow the formatting and spacing exactly.
