Silicalite-1 Supported ZnO as an Efficient Catalyst for Direct Propane Dehydrogenation
Graphical Abstract
Silicalite-1 supported ZnO catalysts were prepared by a simple impregnation method. The as-prepared catalysts exhibited an excellent catalytic activity and stability for PDH reaction. Dispersed ZnO species could be obtained and stabilized via interaction between silanol nests of silicalite-1 support and ZnO species. The interaction between silanol nests and ZnO species could suppress aggregation of ZnO species under reaction conditions.
Abstract
Direct propane dehydrogenation (PDH) is an attractive on-purpose strategy for propylene production. Compared with high-priced Platinum and toxic Chromium oxide, ZnO based catalysts attract wide attention due to its low-cost and environment-friendly character. Herein we report silicalite-1 supported ZnO catalysts for PDH reaction. They exhibited an excellent catalytic performance. The catalyst with 5wt% Zn exhibited the best propane yield with propane conversion reaching 49% and propylene selectivity around 90% at a space velocity of 5000mlg1h1. Characterization with N2 adsorption, XRD, SEM, TEM, EDS, NH3-TPD, UVvis, XPS, 29Si MAS NMR, FT-IR, Py-IR and TGA reveal that the high activity and stability can be attributed to the dispersed ZnO species due to the interaction between silanol nests of silicalite-1 support and ZnO species. This study may open a promising way for development of highly efficient PDH catalysts.
Introduction
Propylene is a vital and basic building block and used for production of a variety of chemicals such as polypropylene, acrylic acid and acrylonitrile.1-5 Propylene is generally produced from petroleum-derived steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) process. However, the current production capacity cannot fully meet the rapidly increasing demand.4, 5 As the hydraulic fracturing technology improves, large volumes of shale gas containing propane can be extracted and direct propane dehydrogenation (PDH) attracts wide attention for propylene production with the advantage of less byproducts.3 Pt and CrOx based catalysts are widely used in industrial PDH process and the representative processes are Catofin and Oleflex, which were developed by UOP and Lummus, respectively.1, 3, 6-10 However, the high cost of Pt, strong toxicity of CrOx in addition to the fast deactivation still hinder their wide applications. Therefore, it is desirable to develop alternative catalysts with low-cost and environment-benign non-noble catalysts.
Among Zn, V, Zr, Co and Fe-based catalysts,11-15 Zn-based catalysts have received more attention due to its low-cost and environment-friendly properties. Both isolated Zn2+ species and nanosized ZnO assemblies were active for PDH reactions.16 However, small ZnO assemblies were generally unstable especially under harsh reaction conditions17 and they were frequently dispersed and stabilized on supports. Schweitzer etal. reported an over 95% propylene selectivity although the catalytic activity was low over the isolated Zn2+ supported on silica exhibiting Lewis acid property.18 A TiZrOx-supported ZnO-containing catalyst was reported to exhibit excellent PDH catalytic performance and isolated tricoordinated Zn2+ species were concluded as the active sites. Its intrinsic activity was enhanced when ZrO2 was promoted by TiO2.19 ZnO/Al2O3 modified by a trace amount of Pt showed excellent PDH activity, in which Lewis acidic ZnO served as active sites and Pt worked as a promoter by increasing the Lewis acidity of Zn2+.20 Furthermore, it was much more stable than the unpromoted ZnO/Al2O3 catalyst. In addition, zeolites were also employed for dispersion of ZnO clusters. For instance, well dispersed small ZnO nanoclusters anchored in the framework of dealuminated Beta zeolite was shown with a high activity and propylene selectivity.17 Chen etal. reported that a high PDH activity was obtained over high silica H-ZSM-5 supported ZnO catalyst. The propylene selectivity and reaction stability increase with elevating SiO2/Al2O3 ratios while the strong acidity of low-silica H-ZSM-5 favors the side reactions and ZnO aggregation.21 In comparison, silicalite-1 (S-1) zeolite has the same MFI topology without strong acidity. Recently, Li etal. contructed Zn-containing catalysts Zn@S-1 throngh in-situ hydrothermal synthesis for PDH reaction and the partially reduced zinc cations were identified as the active sites.22 Furthermore, the presence of abundant defects makes S-1 widely used as catalyst support.23 We wonder whether S-1 is an effective support to directly disperse and stabilize active ZnO species for PDH reaction.
Therefore, S-1 supported ZnO catalysts were prepared by a simple impregnation method and used for PDH reaction, which demonstrated excellent PDH performance. The effect of Zn loading on the catalytic performance was investigated. For comparision, ZnO supported on SiO2, Al2O3 and high-silica H-ZSM-5 were also synthesized for PDH reaction. The results show that 5%Zn/S-1 exhibited a much higher propylene yield than 5%Zn/SiO2, 5%Zn/Al2O3 and 5%Zn/H-ZSM-5 (SiO2/Al2O3=360) under the same reaction condition. The role of ZnO species and support in Zn/S-1 catalysts was elucidated on the basis of detailed characterizations and PDH catalytic performance.
Results and Discussion
Catalytic activity, selectivity, and stability
Figure1 shows that there is almost no conversion of C3H8 on S-1 zeolite. In comparison, the C3H8 conversion increases obviously with introduction of Zn species. The initial propane conversion jumps up from 5.7% to 40.7% as Zn loading increases from 1% to 3%. It further increases to 49.3% with Zn loading increasing to 5%. These results suggest that the catalytic activity is attributed to the presence of Zn species. It is worth noting that all Zn/S-1 catalysts with Zn loading varying in the range of 15% exhibit a good stability. For instance, propane conversion only slightly decreases from 40.7% to 36.5% for 3%Zn/S-1 after 6h reaction. In comparison, the 10%Zn/S-1 exhibits similar initial propane conversion with 5%Zn/S-1 but it suffers a slightly faster deactivation probably due to the formation of a small number of larger ZnO particles with the increase of Zn loading, as evidenced by XRD (Figure4) and TEM (FigureS3) results. A high initial propylene selectivity ranging from 89.2% to 98.8% is achieved on Zn/S-1 catalysts with Zn loading from 1% to 5% with a small amount of methane, ethane, ethylene and C4+ species (Figure1b and TableS1).

The propylene yields are summarized in TableS1, which shows that 5%Zn/S-1 gives a highest yield (44.0%) among the studied catalysts. As show in Figure2, the propane conversions on 5%Zn/SiO2 and 5%Zn/Al2O3 are only 0.32% and 1.67%, respectively. Although 5%Zn/H-ZSM-5 gives a higher initial propane conversion (66.2%) than 5%Zn/S-1, its initial propylene selectivity is only 39.8% thus exhibiting a low propylene yield of only 26.3%. This could be attributed to the strong Brnsted acid sites on H-ZSM-5 zeolite, which catalyze undesirable side reactions.24 Although the propylene selectivity on 5%Zn/H-ZSM-5 increases with time on stream, it remains as low as only 60.7% after 6h time on stream.

Considering the thermodynamic constraints, PDH reactions were also carried out over 5%Zn/S-1 catalyst at different reaction temperatures of 500, 525, 550 and 575C. As shown in Figure3, the initial propane conversion significantly increases from 18.8% to 66.7% while propylene selectivity decreases with the stepwise increasing temperature. The propylene selectivity at 575C decreases significantly due to the facilitated side reactions at high temperature.25 Therefore, the most suitable temperature is chosen as 550C in order to achieve high propane conversion and propylene selectivity simultaneously. FigureS1 shows that a higher space velocity benefits selective formation of propylene. For example, propane conversion only decreases slightly, while propylene selectivity improves with the GHSV increasing from 4000 to 8000mLg1h1. In terms of propylene spacetimeyield (STY), 5%Zn/S-1 exhibits a comparable value compared with zeolite supported Zn-based catalysts reported before under comparable reaction conditions (TableS2).

Characterizations of the catalysts
The XRD patterns in Figure4 show that the S-1 zeolite exhibits a typical MFI structure. Its crystal structure remains unchanged after being supported with ZnO. No diffraction peaks corresponding to ZnO are observed for the catalysts with Zn loading up to 5%, suggesting that Zn species are well dispersed or existing as tiny ZnO particles which are beyond XRD detection limitation.26 However, at 10% loading, weak diffraction peaks attributed to ZnO appear, indicating the growth of Zn species.

XRD patterns of S-1 zeolite and Zn/S-1 catalysts
The SEM images in FigureS2 show that S-1 zeolite is well crystallized with a uniform size distribution about 100nm. The introduction of Zn species has little influence on the morphology. The TEM images in Figure5a and 5b show that small nanoparticles with an average particle size of 3.1nm are distributed uniformly on the fresh 5%Zn/S-1 catalyst. The HRTEM image inserted in Figure5b shows an interplanar spacing 0.247nm, which corresponds to the (101) plane of ZnO crystalline.21 Furthermore, the EDS mapping confirms the homogeneous distribution of Zn species (Figure5). Large ZnO particles appear when the Zn loading increases to 10% (FigureS3), which is consistent with XRD. As shown in Figure5c and 5d, the average particle size of the ZnO nanoparticles over the used 5%Zn/S-1 catalyst remains 3.1nm and no obvious aggregation is observed in comparison with the fresh catalyst. The results demonstrate a good stability of the ZnO species on 5%Zn/S-1 catalyst.

N2 physisorption results (Table1) indicate that the specific surface area and pore volume gradually decrease with the increasing Zn loadings. Below 5% Zn loading, mainly the external surface area decreases, indicating that ZnO species are dispersed on the external surface. Meanwhile, it is reasonable to assume that some ZnO species deposit inside the zeolitic pores considering the slight decrease of microporous surface area.27 As the Zn loading further increases to 10%, both the external surface area and the microporous surface area decrease. This may be attributed to large ZnO particles at a high Zn loading blocking the pore openings of S-1.28

The DR UV-vis in Figure6 shows a band at around 370nm and a weak shoulder one at about 265nm upon introduction of zinc species to S-1 zeolite. These two bands are generally attributed to ZnO crystals on the external zeolite surface and subnanometric ZnO clusters inside zeolitic pores, respectively.29 Furthermore, the intensity of the 370nm band is enhanced with the increasing Zn loading, especially for Zn/S-1 catalyst with higher Zn loading such as 10%Zn/S-1 indicating enhanced formation of ZnO species on the external surface.

DR UV-vis spectra of the catalysts
NH3-TPD and Py-IR are employed to characterize the acidic properties of the catalysts considering that Zn species exhibiting Lewis acidity are generally considered as active sites in PDH reaction.20 As shown in Figure7a and Table1, S-1 zeolite only has a slight signal of NH3 desorption, demonstrating its weak acidic property. However, the acid amount of catalysts is significantly improved after supporting ZnO with the desorption peaks of Zn/S-1 catalysts falling in similar temperature range from 100500C. The Py-IR spectra in Fig. 7b further show that the Zn/S-1 catalysts exhibit Lewis acidity, confirmed by the infrared band at 1453cm1 and no Brnsted acid sites (1540cm1) are decteted.30 The amounts of Lewis acid sites determined from the NH3 desorption amounts gradually increase with the increase of Zn loading. Concretely, the acid amount increase from 0.227mmol/g (1%Zn/S-1) to 0.416mmol/g (3%Zn/S-1), 0.484mmol/g (5%Zn/S-1) and 0.552 mmol/g (10%Zn/S-1).

The XPS spectra in Figure8 shows the spin-orbit splitting value of the Zn 2p peaks in Zn/S-1 is 23eV, which is typical for Zn2+,31 consistent with TEM and UV-vis results. In addition, the binding energy peaks of Zn 2p in Zn/S-1 is 1.1eV higher than that of ZnO (1045eV and 1022eV), suggesting that Zn2+ becomes more electron deficient.19 It indicates SiOZn exists considering that the electron density of Zn in the SiOZn bond is lower than that in the ZnOZn bond. The above result indicates interaction develops between the ZnO species and the support.32

29Si MAS NMR is further applied to explore the interaction between the ZnO species and S-1 zeolite. As shown in Figure9a, two signals are observed over S-1. The Q4 signal at 113ppm is generally assigned to Si(SiO)4 while the Q3 signal at around 103ppm is attributed to (SiOH)(SiO)3 group.33 After the introduction of Zn, the intensity of the 103ppm signal significantly declines, indicating the consumption of silanol groups by interaction with ZnO species. FT-IR is applied to characterize the hydroxyl groups on S-1 and Zn/S-1 catalysts. As shown in Figure9b, there are two major types of OH groups present for S-1 zeolite. The band at 3731cm1 is attributed to isolated silanol groups exposed on external surface while the broad band centered at 3500cm1 is generally characteristic of silanol nests.28, 34 The presence of abundant silanol groups indicates the existence of a large number of defects in S-1 zeolite.35 After the introduction of Zn species at increasing loading, the peak at 3731cm1 weakens slightly. In comparison, the decreased intensity of the 3500cm1 signal is much more significant, indicating that ZnO species are attached to the support mainly through interaction with the silanol nests. In addition, with the increasing Zn loading to 3%, a new band appears at 3672cm1, which may arise from the external Zn-OH groups.36

Yue etal. reported that silanol groups were important for the dispersion of active chromium and GaOx species onto Na-form ZSM-5 support in PDH reaction with silanol nests more helpful.37, 26 Better dispersion of active species can be obtained by interaction between silanol nests and CrOx/GaOx species, resulting in higher dehydrogenation activity thereof. For S-1 supported ZnO catalysts in our work, silanol groups especially silanol nests should have the similar effect. The interaction between silanol nests and ZnO species also suppresses aggregation of ZnO species under reaction conditions, as verified by TEM. Therefore, dispersed active ZnO species through interaction with abundant silanol nests lead to excellent PDH catalytic performance. Furthermore, TGA shows that the amount of coke over the spent 5%Zn/S-1 catalyst after 6h reaction at 550C and a space velocity 8000mLg1h1 is determined to be as low as 2.03% (FigureS4). The good anti-coking ability is another reason for the reaction stability in PDH.
Conclusion
In summary, S-1 zeolite has been demonstrated to be a good support for dispersion and stabilization of ZnO species. ZnO species interact with silanol nests of S-1 zeolite. Thus, the resulting Zn/S-1 catalysts exhibit excellent PDH catalytic performance. For instance, propane conversion reaches 49% and propylene selectivity is around 90% under the conditions of 550C, 0.1Mpa and a space velocity 5000mLh1gcat1. By contrast, propane conversion is only 0.32% and 1.67% over 5%Zn/SiO2 and 5%Zn/Al2O3, and propylene selectivity is 39.8% over 5%Zn/H-ZSM-5. The 5%Zn/S-1 delivers a stable performance within a 6h PDH test and there is little coke detected.
Experimental Section
Catalyst preparation
S-1 zeolite was synthesized as follows. 41.66g tetraethyl orthosilicate (TEOS) and 40.67g tetrapropylammonium hydroxide (TPAOH, 25wt%) were mixed to form a clear solution. The obtained solution was stirred for 4h at room temperature to fully hydrolyze TEOS. Then, it was placed in a 150mL Teflon stainless-steel autoclave to crystallize at 170C for 24h under static conditions. The precipitate was obtained by centrifugation, washed three times with deionized water, and then dried at 80C overnight, which was followed by calcination in air at 550C for 4h.
The S-1 supported ZnO was prepared by impregnation method. The appropriate amount of Zn(NO3)26H2O was dissolved in a certain amount of deionized water and then 2g S-1 zeolite was added to the above solution. The mixture was sonicated and then dried in a rotary evaporator. Then the sample was dried at 80C overnight and calcined at 550C for 4h in air to obtain n%Zn/S-1 (nZn/S-1) catalyst where n% (n) represented the weight percentage of Zn. For comparison, 5% Zn was also supported on SiO2 (fumed silica, 380m2/g), Al2O3 and H-ZSM-5 (SiO2/Al2O3 ratio of 360, purchased from Catalyst plant of Nankai University) following the same procedure and the obtained catalysts were named as 5%Zn/SiO2, 5%Zn/Al2O3 and 5%Zn/H-ZSM-5, respectively.
Catalyst characterization
X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of all the catalysts were obtained on a PANalytical XPert PRO X-ray diffractometer with Cu Kα radiation. N2 adsorption and desorption were measured at a Micromeritics ASAP 2020 instrument at 77K. Before the measurement, the sample was degassed in vacuum at 625K for 4h. The Zn loadings were measured on a Philips Magix-601 XRF spectrometer. Transmission electron microscopes (TEM) and Energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) were performed on a JEM-2100 and JEM-2100F microscope operating at 200kV, respectively. Scanning electron microscopes (SEM) images were recorded on a Hitachi SU8020 instrument.
Temperature-programmed desorption of NH3 (NH3-TPD) experiments were conducted on the Micromeritics AutoChem 2920 analyzer. Before the measurement, the sample (100mg) was firstly treated with He at 550C for 1h. Then, the sample was cooled to 100C and 10% NH3/He was introduced into the sample keeping 100C for 30min followed by flushing with He. Subsequently, the sample was heated in flowing He at a rate of 10Cmin1 with desorbed NH3 recorded using a TCD detector.
Diffuse reflectance UV-vis (DR UV-vis) spectra were recorded on a VARIAN Cary-5000 UV-vis-NIR spectrophotometer with BaSO4 used as a reference. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) spectra were recorded with an ESCALAB 250Xi spectrometer using monochromatized Al Kα radiation. The binding energy of C1s at 284.8eV was used as the reference. 29Si MAS NMR measurements were performed on a Bruker Avance III 600 spectrometer equipped with a 14.1T wide-bore magnet at a resonance frequency of 119.2MHz. The spectra were recorded with a high power proton decoupling sequence at a spinning rate of 8KHz. Chemical shift of 29Si spectra was referenced to kaolinite at 91.5ppm. Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectra were measured at 150C on a Bruker tensor 27 instrument with the samples pretreated at 450C in N2 flow for 1h. Pyridine adsorption experiment (Py-IR) was carried out on a Bruker XF808-04 Spectrometer. The sample was pressed into a thin self-supporting wafer and pretreated in a vacuum at 500C for 30min. Then the sample adsorbed pyridine for 5min after cooling to 30C and the physically adsorbed pyridine was removed in a vacuum at 150C for 30min.
Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was performed on a TA SDT Q600 instrument with the heating rate of 10C min1 from room temperature to 900C in a flowing air.
Catalytic activity measurement
PDH reaction was carried out in a fixed-bed stainless steel reactor. In a typical test, 0.3g catalyst (4060mesh) diluted with 0.5g SiO2 (4060mesh) was loaded in the reactor and heated to 400C for 1h and 550C for 1h in N2 flow (30mLmin1). The feed gas (5% C3H8, balanced by Ar) was fed into the reactor at 25mLmin1 and atmospheric pressure. The effluents were analyzed by an on-line gas chromatograph (Agilent 7890B) equipped with a flame ionization detector (FID) and a thermal conductivity detector (TCD). The sampling was started 5min after the feeding of reactant gas. Propane conversion (XC3H8) and propylene selectivity (SC3H6) were calculated on a carbon atom basis according to the following equations with moles of carbon determined according to the peak area of effluents measured by FID. The selectivity of other products is calculated as the same method as the selectivity to propylene
