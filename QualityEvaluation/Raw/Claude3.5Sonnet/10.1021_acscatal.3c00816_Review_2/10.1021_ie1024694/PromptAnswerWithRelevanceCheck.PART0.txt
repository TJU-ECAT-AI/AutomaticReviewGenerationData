Read the questions and answers provided below. First, critically assess the overall relevance of the answers provided to the set of questions asked.

If, upon your assessment, you find that the answers do not contain information that is relevant to the questions asked, stop your review process immediately and respond with a single sentence: "※※※※※※※The provided answers are not relevant to the questions.※※※※※※※". Do not provide any additional explanation or background information, only this sentence should be given as a response in case of irrelevant answers.

If, however, the answers are relevant to the questions asked, proceed to compile answers for each question according to the instructions below. Ensure to aggregate all the relevant answers from the multiple answer results provided in the document, and organize them sequentially by their order number, compiling the corresponding quotes, English answers, and Chinese answers for each question.

If the provided answers' quotes are not differentiated by question, ensure to break them down and assign the quotes to each respective question, outputting them separately within each question's section.

To provide a comprehensive review, differentiate the responses into quotes, English answers, and Chinese answers for each question based on the details given in the 'Answer' XML tags. Structure your review using the XML format showcased below if the answers are relevant to the questions asked:

<EnglishVersionAnswer>

The given literature does not contain sufficient information to answer the question about synthesis methods for metal-zeolite catalysts in propane dehydrogenation reactions, or about the dominance of MFI and BEA topological zeolites in this application. The provided text appears to be only a title and some metadata for a scientific article, without the full content needed to analyze catalyst synthesis methods or zeolite properties. To properly address this question, we would need access to the full text of the article or additional relevant literature on the topic of propane dehydrogenation catalysts.

The given literature does not contain sufficient information to answer the question about synthesis methods for metal-zeolite catalysts in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions, or about the dominance of MFI and BEA topological zeolites in this application. The provided text only contains the title and some basic publication information for an article about Sn-modified ZSM-5 as a support for platinum catalysts in propane dehydrogenation. Without access to the full text of the article, it is not possible to analyze the synthesis methods, structural characteristics, or effectiveness of these catalysts for PDH reactions. The limited information available does not allow for a meaningful discussion of future developments in PDH catalyst design.
