The literature primarily discusses the synthesis and application of Sn-Beta zeolites for propane dehydrogenation (PDH), rather than providing a comprehensive analysis of different metal-zeolite catalysts. However, we can draw some insights from the information provided:

1. Synthesis methods: The main synthesis method described is a two-step post-synthesis procedure involving dealumination of parent H-Beta zeolite followed by incorporation of Sn species into the framework. This method allows for the creation of single-site catalysts, which are highly effective for PDH reactions.

2. Zeolite topology: The literature focuses on BEA (Beta) topology zeolites, particularly Sn-Beta. While MFI topology is not explicitly mentioned, the effectiveness of BEA topology is highlighted due to its open pore system with 3-dimensional 12-membered ring channels.

3. Structural characteristics: The key structural feature contributing to the effectiveness of Sn-Beta zeolites is the presence of single-site Sn atoms isomorphously substituted in the zeolite framework. This creates isolated Lewis acid sites that are crucial for C-H bond activation and propane dehydrogenation.

4. Other factors: The high thermal stability, resistance to coking, and ability to maintain activity over extended periods (72 hours) are important factors contributing to the effectiveness of Sn-Beta zeolites in PDH reactions.

5. Implications for future developments: The success of Sn-Beta zeolites suggests that future PDH catalyst design should focus on:
   - Creating well-defined single-site metal centers in zeolite frameworks
   - Optimizing the balance between Lewis and Brønsted acidity
   - Enhancing thermal stability and resistance to deactivation
   - Exploring other metal-zeolite combinations that can offer similar or superior performance

While the literature doesn't explicitly compare MFI and BEA topologies, the demonstrated effectiveness of BEA topology in Sn-Beta zeolites for PDH reactions provides valuable insights for future catalyst design and optimization.

该文献主要讨论了Sn-Beta沸石在丙烷脱氢(PDH)中的合成和应用，而不是对不同金属-沸石催化剂进行全面分析。然而，我们可以从提供的信息中得出一些见解：

1. 合成方法：描述的主要合成方法是一个两步后合成程序，包括对母体H-Beta沸石进行脱铝，然后将Sn物种掺入骨架中。这种方法允许创建单点催化剂，对PDH反应高度有效。

2. 沸石拓扑结构：文献重点关注BEA（Beta）拓扑结构沸石，特别是Sn-Beta。虽然没有明确提到MFI拓扑结构，但强调了BEA拓扑结构的有效性，因为它具有由三维12元环通道组成的开放孔系统。

3. 结构特征：Sn-Beta沸石有效性的关键结构特征是沸石骨架中同构取代的单点Sn原子的存在。这创造了对C-H键活化和丙烷脱氢至关重要的孤立Lewis酸位点。

4. 其他因素：高热稳定性、抗积碳性以及在长时间（72小时）内保持活性的能力是Sn-Beta沸石在PDH反应中有效性的重要因素。

5. 对未来发展的影响：Sn-Beta沸石的成功表明，未来PDH催化剂设计应关注：
   - 在沸石骨架中创建明确定义的单点金属中心
   - 优化Lewis酸和Brønsted酸之间的平衡
   - 提高热稳定性和抗失活能力
   - 探索可以提供类似或更优性能的其他金属-沸石组合

虽然文献没有明确比较MFI和BEA拓扑结构，但Sn-Beta沸石在PDH反应中的BEA拓扑结构的有效性为未来催化剂设计和优化提供了宝贵的见解。
