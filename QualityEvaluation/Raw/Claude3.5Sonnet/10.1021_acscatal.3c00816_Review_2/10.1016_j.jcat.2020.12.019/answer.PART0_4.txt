The primary synthesis methods for metal-zeolite catalysts used in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions include:

1. Loading metal species onto metal oxides like SiO2 and Al2O3 to create single-site catalysts.

2. Incorporating metal species into zeolite lattice or framework to construct single-site catalysts.

3. A two-step post-synthesis procedure for Sn-Beta zeolites, involving dealumination of parent H-Beta followed by incorporation of Sn species into the dealuminated Si-Beta framework through impregnation.

While the literature does not explicitly state why MFI and BEA topological zeolites dominate in PDH applications, it does highlight the effectiveness of BEA topology, specifically Sn-Beta zeolite. The BEA framework's structural characteristics contributing to its effectiveness include:

1. Single-site Sn atoms isomorphously substituted in the framework.
2. An open pore system with 3-dimensional 12-membered ring channels.

These features likely contribute to the catalyst's performance by providing well-defined active sites and facilitating mass transport of reactants and products.

The implications for future developments in PDH catalyst design include:

1. Focus on creating single-site catalysts with well-defined structures to elucidate reaction pathways more easily.
2. Exploration of other zeolite topologies or metal species that can be incorporated into zeolite frameworks.
3. Further optimization of synthesis methods to enhance the control over active site distribution and accessibility.
4. Development of catalysts with improved stability and selectivity under PDH reaction conditions.

用于丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应的金属-沸石催化剂的主要合成方法包括：

1. 将金属物种负载到如SiO2和Al2O3等金属氧化物上，创建单点催化剂。

2. 将金属物种掺入沸石晶格或骨架中，构建单点催化剂。

3. 对于Sn-Beta沸石，采用两步后合成程序，包括对母体H-Beta进行脱铝，然后通过浸渍法将Sn物种掺入脱铝后的Si-Beta骨架中。

虽然文献没有明确说明为什么MFI和BEA拓扑结构的沸石在PDH应用中占主导地位，但它确实强调了BEA拓扑结构的有效性，特别是Sn-Beta沸石。BEA框架的结构特征对其有效性的贡献包括：

1. 单点Sn原子同构替代框架中的硅原子。
2. 具有三维12元环通道的开放孔道系统。

这些特征可能通过提供明确定义的活性位点和促进反应物和产物的质量传输来提高催化剂的性能。

对PDH催化剂设计的未来发展的启示包括：

1. 专注于创建具有明确定义结构的单点催化剂，以更容易阐明反应途径。
2. 探索其他可以掺入沸石骨架的沸石拓扑结构或金属物种。
3. 进一步优化合成方法，以增强对活性位点分布和可及性的控制。
4. 开发在PDH反应条件下具有改进稳定性和选择性的催化剂。
