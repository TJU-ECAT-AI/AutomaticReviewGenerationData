[1] "The indirect synthesis of Sn-Beta involves two basic steps: (1) removal of Al atoms from the zeolite framework structure to generate the lattice defects, (2) incorporation of Sn atoms into the vacancies to form Sn containing zeolite"

[2] "Sn-Beta zeolites with different Sn/Si ratios obtained from two steps were investigated with XRD characterization, to verify the possible structural changes in the post-synthesis procedures."

[3] "The feature structure of these samples can be further investigated by IR spectra (Figure S4). All the samples display strong peaks at 820750 cm1 and 10001100 cm1. The adsorption at 820750 cm1 is assigned to the O-T-O (T = Si or Sn) symmetric stretching vibration mode, and characteristic vibration at 10001100 cm1 is ascribed to the five- and six-membered rings of T-O-T in the structure of zeolite Beta"

[4] "The irregular of Beta zeolite in its morphology is ascribed to the coexistence of three polytypes in its crystalline structure with different ratios"

The primary synthesis methods for metal-zeolite catalysts used in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions, particularly for MFI and BEA topological zeolites, involve a two-step post-synthesis procedure. This method includes dealumination of the parent zeolite followed by incorporation of metal species (in this case, Sn) into the framework vacancies.

MFI and BEA zeolites dominate in PDH applications due to their unique structural characteristics. BEA zeolites, for instance, possess an open pore system consisting of 3-dimensional 12-membered ring channels. This structure provides excellent accessibility to active sites and facilitates the diffusion of reactants and products.

The effectiveness of these zeolites in PDH reactions is attributed to several factors:

1. Framework incorporation: The metal species (e.g., Sn) can be incorporated into the zeolite framework, creating isolated single-site metal centers that act as Lewis acid sites. These sites are crucial for the dehydrogenation reaction.

2. Thermal stability: The strong interaction between the metal species and the zeolite framework enhances the catalyst's thermal stability, which is essential for the high-temperature PDH process.

3. Tunable acidity: The synthesis method allows for control over the ratio of Lewis to Brønsted acid sites, which is critical for optimizing selectivity towards the desired product (propylene) while minimizing unwanted side reactions like cracking.

4. Structural flexibility: The coexistence of different polytypes in the crystalline structure of Beta zeolites provides some flexibility, which may contribute to their catalytic performance.

These insights have important implications for future developments in PDH catalyst design. Researchers may focus on:

1. Refining synthesis methods to achieve more precise control over metal incorporation and distribution.
2. Exploring other metal species or combinations that could enhance catalytic performance.
3. Developing strategies to further increase the Lewis to Brønsted acid site ratio to improve selectivity.
4. Investigating the role of zeolite polytypes in catalytic performance and potentially tailoring synthesis methods to favor certain polytypes.
5. Exploring post-synthesis modifications to enhance stability and regeneration capabilities of the catalysts.

By building on these fundamental understandings of zeolite structure and metal incorporation, future PDH catalyst designs could achieve higher activity, selectivity, and stability, leading to more efficient and sustainable propylene production processes.

在丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中使用的金属-沸石催化剂，特别是MFI和BEA拓扑结构的沸石，其主要合成方法涉及两步后合成程序。这种方法包括对母体沸石进行脱铝，然后将金属物种（在本例中为Sn）引入框架空位。

MFI和BEA沸石之所以在PDH应用中占主导地位，是因为它们独特的结构特征。例如，BEA沸石具有由三维12元环通道组成的开放孔道系统。这种结构为活性位提供了极佳的可及性，并促进了反应物和产物的扩散。

这些沸石在PDH反应中的有效性归因于几个因素：

1. 框架掺杂：金属物种（如Sn）可以被掺杂到沸石框架中，形成孤立的单一位点金属中心，作为路易斯酸位点。这些位点对脱氢反应至关重要。

2. 热稳定性：金属物种与沸石框架之间的强相互作用增强了催化剂的热稳定性，这对高温PDH过程至关重要。

3. 可调酸度：合成方法允许控制路易斯酸位与布朗斯特酸位的比例，这对优化目标产物（丙烯）的选择性同时最小化不需要的副反应（如裂解）至关重要。

4. 结构灵活性：Beta沸石晶体结构中不同多型体的共存提供了一定的灵活性，这可能有助于其催化性能。

这些见解对PDH催化剂设计的未来发展有重要启示。研究人员可能会关注：

1. 完善合成方法，以实现对金属掺杂和分布的更精确控制。
2. 探索其他可能增强催化性能的金属物种或组合。
3. 开发策略进一步提高路易斯酸位与布朗斯特酸位的比例，以改善选择性。
4. 研究沸石多型体在催化性能中的作用，并可能调整合成方法以倾向于某些多型体。
5. 探索后合成修饰以增强催化剂的稳定性和再生能力。

通过在这些关于沸石结构和金属掺杂的基本理解上进行深入研究，未来的PDH催化剂设计可以实现更高的活性、选择性和稳定性，从而导致更高效和可持续的丙烯生产过程。
