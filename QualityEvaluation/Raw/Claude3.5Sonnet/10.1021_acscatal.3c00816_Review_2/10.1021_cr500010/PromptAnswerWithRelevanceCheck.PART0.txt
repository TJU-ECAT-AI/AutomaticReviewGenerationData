<EnglishVersionAnswer>

The literature provided does not contain any information specifically about metal-zeolite catalysts for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions or the use of MFI and BEA topological zeolites in this application. The document focuses on general advances in zeolite structures, synthesis, and characterization techniques, but does not discuss catalytic applications or specific zeolite frameworks for PDH reactions. Without relevant information from the given text, I cannot provide a meaningful answer to this question based solely on the content of the document.

<EnglishVersionAnswer>

The given literature does not contain specific information about metal-zeolite catalysts for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions or the dominance of MFI and BEA topological zeolites in this application. The text primarily focuses on recent developments in zeolite structure description, discovery of new zeolite structures, advances in structure determination methods, structure prediction, and evaluation of zeolite feasibility. It does not discuss synthesis methods for PDH catalysts or the effectiveness of particular zeolite topologies for this reaction.

To properly answer this question, additional information from other sources would be required, specifically addressing the synthesis of metal-zeolite catalysts for PDH reactions, the properties of MFI and BEA zeolites that make them suitable for this application, and current research in PDH catalyst design.

所给文献中没有包含关于丙烷脱氢(PDH)反应的金属-沸石催化剂或MFI和BEA拓扑结构沸石在这一应用中占主导地位的具体信息。该文本主要集中在沸石结构描述的最新发展、新沸石结构的发现、结构测定方法的进展、结构预测以及沸石可行性的评估等方面。它没有讨论PDH催化剂的合成方法或特定沸石拓扑结构对这种反应的有效性。

要正确回答这个问题，需要其他来源的额外信息，特别是涉及PDH反应金属-沸石催化剂的合成、使MFI和BEA沸石适合这种应用的特性，以及PDH催化剂设计的当前研究。

The literature provided does not contain any information specifically about metal-zeolite catalysts for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions or the use of MFI and BEA topological zeolites in this application. The text focuses on general aspects of zeolite structures, synthesis, and characterization methods, but does not discuss catalytic applications or specific zeolite types for PDH reactions. Therefore, I cannot provide a direct answer to this question based solely on the given literature.

To properly address this question, additional information would be needed about:

1. The catalytic properties of MFI and BEA zeolites
2. The specific requirements for PDH catalysts
3. How the structural characteristics of MFI and BEA zeolites contribute to their effectiveness in PDH reactions
4. Recent developments in metal-zeolite catalysts for PDH

Without this information, it is not possible to explain why MFI and BEA zeolites dominate in PDH applications or discuss the implications for future catalyst design based on the provided text.

所提供的文献没有包含任何关于丙烷脱氢(PDH)反应的金属-沸石催化剂或MFI和BEA拓扑沸石在该应用中使用的具体信息。该文本主要关注沸石结构、合成和表征方法的一般方面,但没有讨论催化应用或PDH反应的特定沸石类型。因此,我无法仅基于给定的文献对这个问题做出直接回答。

要正确回答这个问题,需要额外的信息,包括:

1. MFI和BEA沸石的催化性能
2. PDH催化剂的具体要求
3. MFI和BEA沸石的结构特征如何contribu对PDH反应的有效性
4. PDH金属-沸石催化剂的最新发展

没有这些信息,我们无法解释为什么MFI和BEA沸石在PDH应用中占主导地位,也无法根据提供的文本讨论未来催化剂设计的影响。
