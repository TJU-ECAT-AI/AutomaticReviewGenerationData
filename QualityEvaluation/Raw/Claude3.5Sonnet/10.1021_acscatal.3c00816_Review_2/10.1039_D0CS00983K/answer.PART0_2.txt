[1] "Ga-containing MFI catalysts also exhibit high dehydrogenation activity, while the nature of the active sites under reaction conditions as well as the role of Brnsted and Lewis acid sites is still discussed controversially."

[2] "Brnsted acid sites are considered to catalyze cracking, dehydrocyclization and coking reactions. In order to modify the acidity caused by the presence of aluminum, aluminum-free gallosilicate MFI without Ga introduction, has been synthesized and evaluated for propane dehydrogenation."

[3] "The obtained material shows a reduction in Brnsted acid sites and enhanced Lewis acidity, and decreasing the B/L acidity ratio is beneficial for the high dehydrogenation activity and propylene selectivity; that is, the most effective catalyst should possess a small amount of Brnsted acidity coupled with strong Lewis acid sites."

[4] "Besides, Brnsted acid sites are important for propane dehydrogenation. Attributed to the large microporosity and Brnsted acidity, a high silica GaBeta catalyst with a Si/Ga ratio of up to 177 synthesized shows relatively good dehydrogenation performance."

[5] "Moreover, Lewis(Ga+)-Brnsted acid pairs are identified as the active sites for propane dehydrogenation over Ga/H-ZSM-5. The increased Lewis acidity facilitates heterolytic CH bond activation, and Brnsted acidity reduces the activation barrier for the elimination of hydrogen."

Metal-zeolite catalysts for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions are primarily synthesized using MFI and BEA topological zeolites due to their unique structural characteristics and acidic properties. These zeolites dominate in PDH applications for several reasons:

1. Balanced acidity: MFI and BEA zeolites offer a good balance between Brønsted and Lewis acid sites. This balance is crucial for PDH reactions, as Lewis acidity facilitates the activation of C-H bonds, while a small amount of Brønsted acidity aids in hydrogen elimination.

2. Microporosity: The large microporosity of these zeolites, particularly in BEA structures, contributes to their effectiveness in PDH reactions by providing a high surface area for catalytic activity.

3. Tunable Si/Al or Si/Ga ratios: These zeolites allow for easy modification of their acidity through the adjustment of Si/Al or Si/Ga ratios. This flexibility enables researchers to optimize the catalyst's performance for PDH reactions.

4. Formation of active sites: MFI and BEA zeolites facilitate the formation of Lewis(Ga+)-Brønsted acid pairs, which are identified as active sites for propane dehydrogenation, especially in Ga-modified ZSM-5 (MFI) catalysts.

5. Resistance to side reactions: By carefully controlling the acidity, these zeolites can be designed to minimize undesirable side reactions such as cracking, dehydrocyclization, and coking, which are typically catalyzed by strong Brønsted acid sites.

The effectiveness of MFI and BEA zeolites in PDH reactions implies that future developments in catalyst design should focus on:

1. Further optimization of the Lewis to Brønsted acid ratio to enhance activity and selectivity.
2. Exploration of novel metal modifications (beyond Ga) to create more efficient active sites.
3. Development of hierarchical structures to improve mass transfer and catalyst stability.
4. Investigation of bimetallic or multi-metal systems within these zeolite frameworks to enhance catalytic performance.
5. Integration of advanced characterization techniques to better understand the nature of active sites under reaction conditions.

These insights suggest that MFI and BEA zeolites will continue to play a crucial role in the development of next-generation PDH catalysts, with a focus on fine-tuning their acidic properties and structural characteristics to achieve higher activity, selectivity, and stability.

金属-沸石催化剂在丙烷脱氢(PDH)反应中主要使用MFI和BEA拓扑结构的沸石，这是由于它们独特的结构特征和酸性质。这些沸石在PDH应用中占主导地位，原因如下：

1. 平衡的酸性：MFI和BEA沸石提供了布朗斯特酸位和路易斯酸位之间的良好平衡。这种平衡对PDH反应至关重要，因为路易斯酸性有助于C-H键的活化，而少量的布朗斯特酸性则有助于氢的消除。

2. 微孔结构：这些沸石的大微孔结构，特别是BEA结构，通过提供高比表面积来促进催化活性，从而提高PDH反应的效率。

3. 可调节的Si/Al或Si/Ga比：这些沸石允许通过调整Si/Al或Si/Ga比来轻松修改其酸性。这种灵活性使研究人员能够优化催化剂在PDH反应中的性能。

4. 活性位点的形成：MFI和BEA沸石有助于形成路易斯(Ga+)-布朗斯特酸对，这被认为是丙烷脱氢的活性位点，特别是在Ga改性的ZSM-5（MFI）催化剂中。

5. 抑制副反应：通过仔细控制酸性，这些沸石可以被设计来最小化不希望的副反应，如裂解、脱氢环化和结焦，这些副反应通常由强布朗斯特酸位催化。

MFI和BEA沸石在PDH反应中的有效性意味着未来催化剂设计的发展应该关注：

1. 进一步优化路易斯酸与布朗斯特酸的比例，以提高活性和选择性。
2. 探索新的金属改性（除Ga外），以创造更高效的活性位点。
3. 开发分级结构，以改善传质和催化剂稳定性。
4. 研究这些沸石框架内的双金属或多金属系统，以提高催化性能。
5. 整合先进的表征技术，以更好地理解反应条件下活性位点的本质。

这些见解表明，MFI和BEA沸石将继续在下一代PDH催化剂的开发中发挥关键作用，重点是精细调节它们的酸性质和结构特征，以实现更高的活性、选择性和稳定性。
