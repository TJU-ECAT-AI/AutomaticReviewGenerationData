[1] "Ga-containing MFI catalysts also exhibit high dehydrogenation activity, while the nature of the active sites under reaction conditions as well as the role of Brnsted and Lewis acid sites is still discussed controversially."

[2] "Brnsted acid sites are considered to catalyze cracking, dehydrocyclization and coking reactions. In order to modify the acidity caused by the presence of aluminum, aluminum-free gallosilicate MFI without Ga introduction, has been synthesized and evaluated for propane dehydrogenation."

[3] "Besides, Brnsted acid sites are important for propane dehydrogenation. Attributed to the large microporosity and Brnsted acidity, a high silica GaBeta catalyst with a Si/Ga ratio of up to 177 synthesized shows relatively good dehydrogenation performance."

[4] "Moreover, Lewis(Ga+)-Brnsted acid pairs are identified as the active sites for propane dehydrogenation over Ga/H-ZSM-5. The increased Lewis acidity facilitates heterolytic CH bond activation, and Brnsted acidity reduces the activation barrier for the elimination of hydrogen."

The primary synthesis methods for metal-zeolite catalysts used in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions typically involve incorporating metals like gallium into MFI and BEA topological zeolites. These zeolites dominate PDH applications due to their unique structural characteristics and acidity properties.

MFI (such as ZSM-5) and BEA (Beta) zeolites are preferred for several reasons:

1. Microporosity: Their microporous structure provides a high surface area and allows for better dispersion of active metal sites.

2. Acidity control: These zeolites offer a good balance of Brønsted and Lewis acid sites, which can be tuned by controlling the Si/Al or Si/Ga ratio.

3. Thermal stability: MFI and BEA zeolites have high thermal stability, which is crucial for the high-temperature conditions of PDH reactions.

4. Shape selectivity: Their pore structures can enhance selectivity towards desired products.

The effectiveness of these catalysts is attributed to:

1. Balanced acidity: The presence of both Brønsted and Lewis acid sites contributes to the catalytic activity. Lewis acidity facilitates C-H bond activation, while Brønsted acidity aids in hydrogen elimination.

2. Metal-support interaction: The incorporation of metals like Ga into the zeolite framework creates active sites for dehydrogenation.

3. Resistance to coking: The pore structure and acidity of these zeolites can help mitigate coke formation.

Future developments in PDH catalyst design may focus on:

1. Further optimization of metal-zeolite interactions to enhance activity and stability.

2. Development of hierarchical zeolite structures to improve mass transfer and catalyst lifetime.

3. Exploration of bimetallic or multi-metal systems within zeolite frameworks for synergistic effects.

4. Fine-tuning of acidity and pore structure to maximize propylene selectivity while minimizing side reactions.

These insights suggest that future PDH catalyst design will likely continue to leverage the advantageous properties of MFI and BEA zeolites while exploring novel modifications to enhance their performance and longevity.

用于丙烷脱氢(PDH)反应的金属-沸石催化剂的主要合成方法通常涉及将镓等金属掺入MFI和BEA拓扑结构的沸石中。这些沸石在PDH应用中占主导地位，主要是由于它们独特的结构特征和酸度性质。

MFI（如ZSM-5）和BEA（Beta）沸石之所以受到青睐，原因如下：

1. 微孔结构：它们的微孔结构提供了高比表面积，并允许活性金属位点更好地分散。

2. 酸度控制：这些沸石提供了布朗斯特酸位和路易斯酸位的良好平衡，可以通过控制Si/Al或Si/Ga比来调节。

3. 热稳定性：MFI和BEA沸石具有高热稳定性，这对于PDH反应的高温条件至关重要。

4. 形状选择性：它们的孔道结构可以增强对目标产物的选择性。

这些催化剂的有效性归因于：

1. 平衡的酸度：布朗斯特酸位和路易斯酸位的存在有助于催化活性。路易斯酸性有助于C-H键活化，而布朗斯特酸性则有助于氢消除。

2. 金属-载体相互作用：将镓等金属掺入沸石骨架创造了脱氢活性位点。

3. 抗结焦性：这些沸石的孔道结构和酸度可以帮助减少焦炭形成。

PDH催化剂设计的未来发展可能集中在：

1. 进一步优化金属-沸石相互作用，以提高活性和稳定性。

2. 开发分级沸石结构，以改善传质和延长催化剂寿命。

3. 探索沸石骨架内的双金属或多金属体系，以产生协同效应。

4. 精细调节酸度和孔道结构，以最大化丙烯选择性，同时最小化副反应。

这些见解表明，未来PDH催化剂设计可能会继续利用MFI和BEA沸石的优势特性，同时探索新颖的改进方法以提高它们的性能和使用寿命。
