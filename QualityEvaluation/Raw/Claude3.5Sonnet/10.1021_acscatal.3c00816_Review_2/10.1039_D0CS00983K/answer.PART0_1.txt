[1] "Ga-containing MFI catalysts also exhibit high dehydrogenation activity, while the nature of the active sites under reaction conditions as well as the role of Brnsted and Lewis acid sites is still discussed controversially."

[2] "In order to modify the acidity caused by the presence of aluminum, aluminum-free gallosilicate MFI without Ga introduction, has been synthesized and evaluated for propane dehydrogenation."

[3] "The obtained material shows a reduction in Brnsted acid sites and enhanced Lewis acidity, and decreasing the B/L acidity ratio is beneficial for the high dehydrogenation activity and propylene selectivity; that is, the most effective catalyst should possess a small amount of Brnsted acidity coupled with strong Lewis acid sites."

[4] "Besides, Brnsted acid sites are important for propane dehydrogenation. Attributed to the large microporosity and Brnsted acidity, a high silica GaBeta catalyst with a Si/Ga ratio of up to 177 synthesized shows relatively good dehydrogenation performance."

[5] "Moreover, Lewis(Ga+)-Brnsted acid pairs are identified as the active sites for propane dehydrogenation over Ga/H-ZSM-5. The increased Lewis acidity facilitates heterolytic CH bond activation, and Brnsted acidity reduces the activation barrier for the elimination of hydrogen."

Metal-zeolite catalysts for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions are primarily synthesized using MFI and BEA topological zeolites due to their unique structural characteristics and acidic properties. These zeolites dominate PDH applications for several reasons:

1. Acidity control: MFI and BEA zeolites allow for precise control of Brønsted and Lewis acidity. The ability to modify the ratio of these acid sites is crucial for optimizing PDH performance. A balance of small amounts of Brønsted acidity coupled with strong Lewis acidity has been found to be most effective.

2. Microporosity: The large microporosity of these zeolites, particularly in BEA structures, contributes to their effectiveness in PDH reactions. This porosity allows for better dispersion of active metal species and facilitates the diffusion of reactants and products.

3. Active site formation: MFI and BEA zeolites provide an excellent framework for creating active sites, such as Lewis(Ga+)-Brønsted acid pairs, which are crucial for PDH reactions. These sites facilitate the heterolytic C-H bond activation and hydrogen elimination steps.

4. Flexibility in metal incorporation: These zeolites can accommodate various metal species, with gallium being particularly effective. The ability to synthesize aluminum-free gallosilicate MFI structures allows for further fine-tuning of catalytic properties.

5. High thermal stability: MFI and BEA zeolites exhibit good thermal stability, which is essential for the high-temperature conditions typically used in PDH reactions.

The effectiveness of these zeolites in PDH reactions stems from their ability to balance various factors such as acidity, porosity, and active site distribution. This balance promotes high dehydrogenation activity and propylene selectivity while minimizing side reactions.

For future developments in PDH catalyst design, the insights gained from MFI and BEA zeolites suggest several directions:

1. Further optimization of the Brønsted to Lewis acidity ratio to enhance activity and selectivity.
2. Exploration of novel metal combinations or incorporation methods to create more efficient active sites.
3. Development of hierarchical zeolite structures to improve mass transfer and catalyst longevity.
4. Investigation of other zeolite topologies that might offer similar or superior properties for PDH reactions.
5. Focus on enhancing the stability of active sites to prolong catalyst lifetime and reduce deactivation rates.

These advancements could lead to more efficient, stable, and selective PDH catalysts, potentially improving the economic viability and sustainability of propylene production through this route.

用于丙烷脱氢(PDH)反应的金属-沸石催化剂主要使用MFI和BEA拓扑结构的沸石合成，这是由于它们独特的结构特征和酸性质。这些沸石在PDH应用中占主导地位，原因如下：

1. 酸度控制：MFI和BEA沸石允许精确控制布朗斯特酸和路易斯酸的比例。调节这些酸性位点的比例对优化PDH性能至关重要。研究发现，少量布朗斯特酸性与强路易斯酸性的平衡最为有效。

2. 微孔结构：这些沸石的大微孔结构，特别是BEA结构，对其在PDH反应中的有效性贡献很大。这种孔隙度有利于活性金属物种的更好分散，并促进反应物和产物的扩散。

3. 活性位点形成：MFI和BEA沸石为创建活性位点提供了优秀的框架，如路易斯(Ga+)-布朗斯特酸对，这对PDH反应至关重要。这些位点促进了C-H键的异裂活化和氢气脱除步骤。

4. 金属掺杂的灵活性：这些沸石可以容纳各种金属物种，其中镓特别有效。合成无铝的镓硅MFI结构的能力允许进一步微调催化性能。

5. 高热稳定性：MFI和BEA沸石表现出良好的热稳定性，这对于PDH反应通常使用的高温条件至关重要。

这些沸石在PDH反应中的有效性源于它们能够平衡酸度、孔隙度和活性位点分布等各种因素。这种平衡促进了高脱氢活性和丙烯选择性，同时最小化了副反应。

对于PDH催化剂设计的未来发展，从MFI和BEA沸石获得的见解提供了几个方向：

1. 进一步优化布朗斯特酸与路易斯酸的比例，以提高活性和选择性。
2. 探索新的金属组合或掺杂方法，创造更高效的活性位点。
3. 开发分级沸石结构，改善传质效果和催化剂寿命。
4. 研究可能为PDH反应提供类似或更优性能的其他沸石拓扑结构。
5. 专注于提高活性位点的稳定性，延长催化剂寿命并减少失活率。

这些进展可能导致更高效、更稳定、更具选择性的PDH催化剂，潜在地提高通过这种路线生产丙烯的经济可行性和可持续性。
