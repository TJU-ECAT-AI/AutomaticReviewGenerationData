[1] "Ga-containing MFI catalysts also exhibit high dehydrogenation activity, while the nature of the active sites under reaction conditions as well as the role of Brnsted and Lewis acid sites is still discussed controversially."

[2] "Besides, Brnsted acid sites are important for propane dehydrogenation. Attributed to the large microporosity and Brnsted acidity, a high silica GaBeta catalyst with a Si/Ga ratio of up to 177 synthesized shows relatively good dehydrogenation performance."

[3] "In order to modify the acidity caused by the presence of aluminum, aluminum-free gallosilicate MFI without Ga introduction, has been synthesized and evaluated for propane dehydrogenation. The obtained material shows a reduction in Brnsted acid sites and enhanced Lewis acidity, and decreasing the B/L acidity ratio is beneficial for the high dehydrogenation activity and propylene selectivity; that is, the most effective catalyst should possess a small amount of Brnsted acidity coupled with strong Lewis acid sites."

[4] "Subsequently, the same research group synthesized hierarchical Ga-MFI zeolites with higher Lewis acid site concentration. Compared with bulk Ga-MFI catalyst, hierarchical zeolites are intrinsically more active, with elevated propylene selectivity."

The primary synthesis methods for metal-zeolite catalysts used in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions include introducing gallium into MFI and BEA zeolite frameworks. These topologies dominate PDH applications due to their unique structural characteristics and acidity properties.

MFI and BEA zeolites are effective for PDH reactions because:

1. Microporosity: Their large microporous structure allows for efficient diffusion of reactants and products.

2. Acidity control: These zeolites allow for precise tuning of Brønsted and Lewis acid sites, which is crucial for PDH performance.

3. High stability: MFI and BEA frameworks exhibit good thermal and hydrothermal stability under PDH conditions.

4. Gallium incorporation: These zeolites can effectively incorporate gallium, which enhances PDH activity and selectivity.

The synthesis methods focus on optimizing the balance between Brønsted and Lewis acidity. Researchers have developed strategies such as:

1. Aluminum-free gallosilicate MFI synthesis to reduce Brønsted acidity and enhance Lewis acidity.

2. High silica Ga-Beta zeolite synthesis to maintain some Brønsted acidity while introducing gallium.

3. Hierarchical Ga-MFI zeolite synthesis to increase Lewis acid site concentration and improve catalytic performance.

These developments suggest that future PDH catalyst design will likely focus on:

1. Further optimization of the Brønsted to Lewis acid ratio in zeolite frameworks.

2. Development of novel synthesis methods to achieve more precise control over acid site distribution and strength.

3. Exploration of hierarchical structures to enhance diffusion properties and catalytic activity.

4. Investigation of new metal dopants or combinations to improve PDH performance while maintaining zeolite stability.

5. Tailoring of zeolite pore structures to enhance shape selectivity and minimize side reactions in PDH processes.

用于丙烷脱氢(PDH)反应的金属-沸石催化剂的主要合成方法包括将镓引入MFI和BEA沸石框架中。这些拓扑结构在PDH应用中占主导地位，是因为它们独特的结构特征和酸性质。

MFI和BEA沸石之所以对PDH反应有效，是因为：

1. 微孔性：它们的大微孔结构允许反应物和产物有效扩散。

2. 酸度控制：这些沸石允许精确调节Brønsted和Lewis酸位，这对PDH性能至关重要。

3. 高稳定性：MFI和BEA框架在PDH条件下表现出良好的热稳定性和水热稳定性。

4. 镓的引入：这些沸石可以有效地引入镓，从而增强PDH活性和选择性。

合成方法主要集中在优化Brønsted酸和Lewis酸之间的平衡。研究人员已经开发了以下策略：

1. 无铝镓硅MFI沸石的合成，以减少Brønsted酸性并增强Lewis酸性。

2. 高硅Ga-Beta沸石的合成，以保持一定的Brønsted酸性，同时引入镓。

3. 层次结构Ga-MFI沸石的合成，以增加Lewis酸位浓度并提高催化性能。

这些发展表明，未来PDH催化剂设计可能会集中在：

1. 进一步优化沸石框架中Brønsted酸与Lewis酸的比例。

2. 开发新的合成方法，以实现对酸位分布和强度的更精确控制。

3. 探索层次结构，以增强扩散性能和催化活性。

4. 研究新的金属掺杂剂或组合，以提高PDH性能，同时保持沸石稳定性。

5. 定制沸石孔结构，以增强形状选择性并最小化PDH过程中的副反应。
