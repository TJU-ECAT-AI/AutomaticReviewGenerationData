[1] "Ga-containing MFI catalysts also exhibit high dehydrogenation activity, while the nature of the active sites under reaction conditions as well as the role of Brnsted and Lewis acid sites is still discussed controversially."

[2] "Besides, Brnsted acid sites are important for propane dehydrogenation. Attributed to the large microporosity and Brnsted acidity, a high silica GaBeta catalyst with a Si/Ga ratio of up to 177 synthesized shows relatively good dehydrogenation performance."

[3] "In order to modify the acidity caused by the presence of aluminum, aluminum-free gallosilicate MFI without Ga introduction, has been synthesized and evaluated for propane dehydrogenation. The obtained material shows a reduction in Brnsted acid sites and enhanced Lewis acidity, and decreasing the B/L acidity ratio is beneficial for the high dehydrogenation activity and propylene selectivity; that is, the most effective catalyst should possess a small amount of Brnsted acidity coupled with strong Lewis acid sites."

[4] "Subsequently, the same research group synthesized hierarchical Ga-MFI zeolites with higher Lewis acid site concentration. Compared with bulk Ga-MFI catalyst, hierarchical zeolites are intrinsically more active, with elevated propylene selectivity."
