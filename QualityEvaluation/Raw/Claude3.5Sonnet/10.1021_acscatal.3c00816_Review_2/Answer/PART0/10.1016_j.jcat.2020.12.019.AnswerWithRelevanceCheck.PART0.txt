          "The incorporation of metal species into zeolite lattice or framework has been confirmed to be another effective strategy for the construction of single-site catalyst"

"Sn-Beta zeolites were synthesized via a well-established two-step post-synthesis procedure, which is composed of the dealumination of parent H-Beta and then incorporation of Sn species into the framework of dealuminated Si-Beta through an impregnation process"

"The Sn-Beta zeolite, which contains the single-site Sn atoms isomorphously substituted in the BEA framework and possesses an open pore system consisting of 3-dimensional 12-membered ring channels, has gained great applications in catalytic biomass conversion"

"Sn-Beta zeolite is able to activate the C-H bond of propane at a high temperature, and it exhibits high selectivity, good activity, and excellent stability in propane dehydrogenation."

"Loading metal species onto metal oxide, such as SiO2 and Al2O3, is a common way for the fabrication of single-site catalysts, and the obtained isolated metal oxide species deliver high performance in propane dehydrogenation reaction"

          The primary synthesis methods for metal-zeolite catalysts used in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions include:

1. Incorporation of metal species into zeolite lattice or framework to create single-site catalysts.
2. A two-step post-synthesis procedure for zeolites like Sn-Beta, involving:
   a) Dealumination of the parent zeolite (e.g., H-Beta)
   b) Incorporation of metal species (e.g., Sn) into the dealuminated framework through impregnation
3. Loading metal species onto metal oxides such as SiO2 and Al2O3 to create single-site catalysts.

MFI and BEA topological zeolites dominate in PDH applications due to their structural characteristics:

1. BEA zeolites (e.g., Sn-Beta) possess an open pore system with 3-dimensional 12-membered ring channels, providing accessibility to reactants and products.
2. These structures allow for the isomorphous substitution of metal atoms (e.g., Sn) into the framework, creating single-site catalysts.
3. The framework structure provides thermal stability and allows for strong anchoring of metal species, leading to excellent stability under harsh reaction conditions.

The effectiveness of these zeolites in PDH reactions is attributed to:

1. Ability to activate C-H bonds at high temperatures.
2. High selectivity towards desired products.
3. Good catalytic activity.
4. Excellent stability over long periods.

Implications for future developments in PDH catalyst design include:

1. Focus on creating more efficient single-site catalysts within zeolite frameworks.
2. Exploration of other zeolite topologies that can provide similar or better structural advantages.
3. Fine-tuning of metal incorporation methods to optimize catalyst performance.
4. Development of synthesis methods that allow for precise control over the distribution and nature of active sites within the zeolite structure.
5. Further investigation into the relationship between zeolite structure and catalytic performance in PDH reactions.

          用于丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应的金属-沸石催化剂的主要合成方法包括：

1. 将金属物种掺入沸石晶格或骨架，创造单位点催化剂。
2. 对于像Sn-Beta这样的沸石，采用两步后合成程序：
   a) 对母体沸石（如H-Beta）进行脱铝
   b) 通过浸渍将金属物种（如Sn）掺入脱铝后的骨架
3. 将金属物种负载到如SiO2和Al2O3等金属氧化物上，创建单位点催化剂。

MFI和BEA拓扑结构的沸石在PDH应用中占主导地位，这是由于它们的结构特征：

1. BEA沸石（如Sn-Beta）具有由三维12元环通道组成的开放孔系统，为反应物和产物提供可达性。
2. 这些结构允许金属原子（如Sn）同形取代进入骨架，创造单位点催化剂。
3. 骨架结构提供热稳定性，并允许金属物种强烈锚定，在苛刻的反应条件下具有优异的稳定性。

这些沸石在PDH反应中的有效性归因于：

1. 能够在高温下活化C-H键。
2. 对目标产物具有高选择性。
3. 良好的催化活性。
4. 长期优异的稳定性。

对PDH催化剂设计未来发展的启示包括：

1. 专注于在沸石骨架内创造更高效的单位点催化剂。
2. 探索可提供类似或更好结构优势的其他沸石拓扑结构。
3. 精细调整金属掺入方法以优化催化剂性能。
4. 开发允许精确控制沸石结构内活性位点分布和性质的合成方法。
5. 进一步研究沸石结构与PDH反应中催化性能之间的关系。
