          [1] "The synthesis method of metal-zeolite catalysts mainly includes postsynthesis (e.g., ion exchange and impregnation) and direct synthesis (in situ introduce metal sites along with zeolite crystallization)."

[2] "Among them, the MFI and BEA topological zeolites dominate in PDH study (Tables 12), which may be attributed to their relatively facile synthesis procedure, tunable acidity, and moderate pore size."

[3] "Kumar et al. (131) synthesized a set of catalysts with identical Pt loadings and similar Pt dispersion but varied pore geometries (SBA-15, Beta, and ZSM-5). Among the investigated catalysts, Pt-ZSM-5 with the smallest pores shows the highest TOF of 0.24 s1, followed by Pt-Beta (0.21 s1) and Pt-SBA-15 (0.17 s1)."

[4] "The authors attributed the superior performance of microporous materials to the small 3D pores, which may facilitate the interaction between active sites and reactants."

[5] "ZSM-5 also enables various heteroatoms to be incorporated within its framework to anchor impregnated Pt species."

[6] "S-1 is the Al-free analogue of ZSM-5. The absence of Bronsted acid sites facilitates propylene desorption toward superior propylene selectivity compared to the counterparts with ZSM-5 supports."

          The primary synthesis methods for metal-zeolite catalysts used in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions are postsynthesis (including ion exchange and impregnation) and direct synthesis (in situ introduction of metal sites during zeolite crystallization).

MFI and BEA topological zeolites dominate in PDH applications due to several factors:

1. Facile synthesis procedure: These zeolites are relatively easy to produce.
2. Tunable acidity: The ability to adjust the acidity allows for better control over catalytic properties.
3. Moderate pore size: Suitable for PDH reactions, striking a balance between reactant accessibility and product selectivity.
4. Superior performance: Microporous materials like ZSM-5 (MFI topology) exhibit higher turnover frequencies (TOF) compared to mesoporous materials.
5. Enhanced interaction: The small 3D pores facilitate better interaction between active sites and reactants.
6. Versatility: These zeolites can incorporate various heteroatoms within their framework, helping to anchor impregnated metal species.

The structural characteristics of MFI and BEA zeolites contribute to their effectiveness by:

1. Providing a stable and efficient catalyst support.
2. Enhancing reactant-catalyst interactions due to their microporous nature.
3. Allowing for the incorporation of different metals and heteroatoms to optimize catalytic properties.

Implications for future developments in PDH catalyst design include:

1. Further optimization of pore size and structure to enhance reactant-catalyst interactions and product selectivity.
2. Exploration of novel heteroatom incorporations to improve metal dispersion and stability.
3. Development of synthesis methods for greater control over acidity and metal site distribution.
4. Investigation of hybrid structures or hierarchical porous systems.
5. Focus on sustainable and cost-effective synthesis methods for large-scale industrial applications.
6. Exploration of Al-free analogues like S-1 (Al-free ZSM-5) to enhance propylene selectivity by facilitating desorption.

          用于丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应的金属-沸石催化剂的主要合成方法包括后合成法（如离子交换和浸渍）和直接合成法（在沸石结晶过程中原位引入金属位点）。

MFI和BEA拓扑结构的沸石在PDH应用中占主导地位，原因如下：

1. 合成过程简单：这些沸石相对容易生产。
2. 可调酸度：调节酸度的能力允许更好地控制催化性能。
3. 适中的孔径：适合PDH反应，在反应物可及性和产物选择性之间取得平衡。
4. 优越的性能：像ZSM-5（MFI拓扑结构）这样的微孔材料比介孔材料表现出更高的转化频率（TOF）。
5. 增强相互作用：小型3D孔道促进了活性位点与反应物之间的更好相互作用。
6. 多功能性：这些沸石可以在其骨架中掺入各种杂原子，有助于固定浸渍的金属物种。

MFI和BEA沸石的结构特征通过以下方式提高其有效性：

1. 提供稳定和高效的催化剂支持。
2. 由于其微孔性质，增强了反应物-催化剂相互作用。
3. 允许掺入不同的金属和杂原子以优化催化性能。

对PDH催化剂设计未来发展的启示包括：

1. 进一步优化孔径和结构，以增强反应物-催化剂相互作用和产物选择性。
2. 探索新型杂原子掺杂，以改善金属分散性和稳定性。
3. 开发合成方法，以更好地控制酸度和金属位点分布。
4. 研究混合结构或分级多孔系统。
5. 关注可持续和成本效益高的合成方法，以适应大规模工业应用。
6. 探索无铝类似物如S-1（无铝ZSM-5），通过促进脱附来提高丙烯选择性。
