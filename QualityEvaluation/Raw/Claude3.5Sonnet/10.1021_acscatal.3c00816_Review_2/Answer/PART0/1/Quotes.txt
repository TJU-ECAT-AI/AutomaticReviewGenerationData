"Supported platinum-tin catalysts have been studied in depth, they show high activity and selectivity in the process"

"Generally speaking, the Z-La(OH)2+ species can change into the Z-LaO(OH) as the temperature is raised. In this way, the strong interaction between La3+ and the support can partially restrict the breaking of the SiOAl bonds of the ZSM-5 zeolite, thus preventing the dealumination of the support."

"Sn-Beta zeolite is able to activate the C-H bond of propane at a high temperature, and it exhibits high selectivity, good activity, and excellent stability in propane dehydrogenation."

"Loading metal species onto metal oxide, such as SiO2 and Al2O3, is a common way for the fabrication of single-site catalysts, and the obtained isolated metal oxide species deliver high performance in propane dehydrogenation reaction"

[1] "Our search for a highly active and more durable PDH catalyst has focused on using a siliceous MFI zeolite with a hierarchical micro-/mesoporous structure as a replacement for the alumina support."

[2] "This zeolite, synthesized using a multi-ammonium surfactant as a structure-directing agent, has attracted attention as an advanced catalyst support owing to its unique structure, which comprises ultrathin zeolite frameworks and three-dimensionally interconnected mesopores that boost the catalytic performance of supported metals by providing both facile reactant and product diffusion and high metal nanoparticle dispersion within the mesopores"

"Pt-based catalysts as one of the most used industrial catalysts in heterogeneous catalysis, it is essential for the on-purpose catalytic dehydrogenation of propane to propylene (PDH)."

"The optimal 0.5Pt0.5Ce/Beta-557 catalyst showed excellent catalytic performance because the well dispersed PtCe species formed stable structure of PtCe nanoalloys, which is attributed to the dense silanol nests and trace Al sites of the high-silica Beta-557 zeolite."

[1] "Herein, spatially isolated cobalt oxide sites within nitrogen-doped carbon (NC) layers supported on silicalite-1 zeolite (S-1, MFI zeotype) were synthesized by a two-step process consisting of the pyrolysis of bimetallic Zn/Co zeolitic imidazole frameworks loaded on silicalite-1 (ZnCo-ZIF/S-1) under N2 and the subsequent calcination in air atmosphere."

          [2] "Pt-ZSM-5 presents the highest propane conversion followed by Pt-Beta and Pt-SBA-15 indicating that the activity decreases with increasing pore size (ZSM-5 < Beta < SBA-15) of the support."

          [3] "These observations demonstrate that the three dimensional microporous materials are better catalytic supports for DHP than the mesoporous SBA-15 because of their intrinsic nature that may induce optimum catalytic properties of Pt sites."

[1] "Chen etal. reported that a high PDH activity was obtained over high silica H-ZSM-5 supported ZnO catalyst. The propylene selectivity and reaction stability increase with elevating SiO2/Al2O3 ratios while the strong acidity of low-silica H-ZSM-5 favors the side reactions and ZnO aggregation."

[2] "In comparison, silicalite-1 (S-1) zeolite has the same MFI topology without strong acidity. Recently, Li etal. contructed Zn-containing catalysts Zn@S-1 throngh in-situ hydrothermal synthesis for PDH reaction and the partially reduced zinc cations were identified as the active sites."

[1] "Ga-containing MFI catalysts also exhibit high dehydrogenation activity, while the nature of the active sites under reaction conditions as well as the role of Brnsted and Lewis acid sites is still discussed controversially."

[2] "Besides, Brnsted acid sites are important for propane dehydrogenation. Attributed to the large microporosity and Brnsted acidity, a high silica GaBeta catalyst with a Si/Ga ratio of up to 177 synthesized shows relatively good dehydrogenation performance."

[3] "In order to modify the acidity caused by the presence of aluminum, aluminum-free gallosilicate MFI without Ga introduction, has been synthesized and evaluated for propane dehydrogenation."

[4] "The obtained material shows a reduction in Brnsted acid sites and enhanced Lewis acidity, and decreasing the B/L acidity ratio is beneficial for the high dehydrogenation activity and propylene selectivity; that is, the most effective catalyst should possess a small amount of Brnsted acidity coupled with strong Lewis acid sites."

[5] "Moreover, Lewis(Ga+)-Brnsted acid pairs are identified as the active sites for propane dehydrogenation over Ga/H-ZSM-5. The increased Lewis acidity facilitates heterolytic CH bond activation, and Brnsted acidity reduces the activation barrier for the elimination of hydrogen."

[1] "The synthesis method of metal-zeolite catalysts mainly includes postsynthesis (e.g., ion exchange and impregnation) and direct synthesis (in situ introduce metal sites along with zeolite crystallization)."

[2] "Among them, the MFI and BEA topological zeolites dominate in PDH study (Tables 12), which may be attributed to their relatively facile synthesis procedure, tunable acidity, and moderate pore size."

[3] "Kumar et al. (131) synthesized a set of catalysts with identical Pt loadings and similar Pt dispersion but varied pore geometries (SBA-15, Beta, and ZSM-5). Among the investigated catalysts, Pt-ZSM-5 with the smallest pores shows the highest TOF of 0.24 s1, followed by Pt-Beta (0.21 s1) and Pt-SBA-15 (0.17 s1)."

[3] "ZnO supported on the high-silica HZSM-5 was found to be an efficient catalyst for PDH as compared to the ZnO catalysts on other supports (e.g. low-silica HZSM-5, silicalite-1, Al2O3 and SiO2)."

[4] "The high specific surface area and large pore volume, well-defined structure and sparse Al sites in the high-silica HZSM-5 cause Zn species distribute well throughout the support, which is directly related to the catalytic activity"

[5] "The structural properties of bare HZSM-5 zeolites with varying SiO2/Al2O3 ratios and 10%Zn/xHZSM-5 catalysts were analyzed by using of powder XRD patterns, wherein all the samples exhibit typical MFI diffraction peaks of ZSM-5 zeolite."

[6] "Clearly, four kinds of elements, including Si, O, Al, and Zn, distribute well throughout the whole selected area, revealing a good dispersion of Zn species."

[7] "The activity test results show that the catalytic performance of Zn/HZSM-5 catalyst is enhanced as raising the SiO2/Al2O3 ratio. Further increasing the SiO2/Al2O3 ratio to 1500 results in a decrease of propane conversion, suggesting there is a trade-off between framework Al atoms and active Zn species."

[8] "In combination with above characterizations, the high SiO2/Al2O3 ratio of HZSM-5 support, with low Al content and good structural properties, shows positive effects on the catalytic performance of ZnO in PDH by providing appropriate acidic condition, dispersing Zn species and having strong interaction with the supported Zn species."

"Avelino Corma and coworkers found an innovative approach that can generate Pt nanoparticles and single Pt atoms with remarkably high thermal stability, formed within purely siliceous MCM-22 during the growth of a two-dimensional zeolite into three dimensions."

"A second metal element such as Sn can be incorporated together with Pt following the same synthesis procedure. A similar situation occurred again. After calcination in air, Pt species in the K-free PtSn@MFI sample agglomerate into nanoparticles, while the Pt species in the KPtSn@MFI sample remain atomically dispersed"

"Xu et al. reported that a zeolitic support displaying a low concentration of medium and strong acid sites and a relatively high concentration of weak acid sites was found to lead to the most active and stable catalyst."

"Xu et al. reported dehydrogenation activity on both Lewis and Brnsted acid sites on GaO3/H-ZSM-5. A zeolitic support displaying a low concentration of medium and strong acid sites and a relatively high concentration of weak acid sites was found to lead to the most active and stable catalyst."

"Work on the promotion of GaOx-based dehydrogenation catalysts appears to be limited, although a patent by Iezzi et al. claims that a catalyst comprising 1.2 wt % Ga2O3, <99 ppm of Pt, and 1.6 wt % of SiO2 on an Al2O3 support represents a highly active formulation in the dehydrogenation reaction."

"Notably, the structure of the support is also important, as a mesoporous GaAl mixed oxide exhibited an increased resistance to catalyst coking."

"Several authors claim that two-dimensional polymeric V3+ or V4+ species are the most active for dehydrogenation, the vanadium species bonded directly with the γ/θ-alumina support being the most active sites in PDH."

"For example, Fujdala and Tilley have reported the use of a cothermolysis method involving several thermolytic molecular precursors to produce a Cr/Si/Zr/O catalyst capable of showing propane conversions greater than 35% and propylene selectivities exceeding 90% at 450 C."

[6] "CoOx@NC/S-1 catalyst shows a propane conversion of 40% with the propene selectivity of 97%, and the propane conversion does not decrease significantly after a 10 h PDH reaction at 600 C."

[1] "As reported, ZSM-5 zeolite has some unique physical properties, which makes the ZSM-5 as an interesting material for applications as a catalyst carrier in the reaction of propane dehydrogenation."

[2] "Ce-containing ZSM-5 zeolites were hydrothermally synthesized and then used as supports for platinumtin catalysts in propane dehydrogenation."

[3] "To further create more active centers and enhance the tolerance against catalyst deactivation, the incorporation of metal species into the material matrix has been confirmed as effective way."

[4] "An approach to overcome this inconvenience is the isomorphous substitution of Al or Si in the zeolite framework by other atoms to prepare modified zeolites having new physicochemical properties."

[5] "Among the several reported catalysts, bimetallic PtSn ones exhibit relatively high reaction activities,2,8,9 which have been commercialized by UOP."

[6] "PtSnNa/Ce(X)-ZSM-5 catalysts were prepared by sequential impregnation method."

[1] "The catalysts were prepared by incipient wetness impregnation and were characterized by N2-physisorption, X-ray diffraction (XRD) and H2-chemisorption."

          [2] "Pt-ZSM-5 presents the highest propane conversion followed by Pt-Beta and Pt-SBA-15 indicating that the activity decreases with increasing pore size (ZSM-5 < Beta < SBA-15) of the support."

          [3] "These observations demonstrate that the three dimensional microporous materials are better catalytic supports for DHP than the mesoporous SBA-15 because of their intrinsic nature that may induce optimum catalytic properties of Pt sites."

[1] "Chen etal. reported that a high PDH activity was obtained over high silica H-ZSM-5 supported ZnO catalyst. The propylene selectivity and reaction stability increase with elevating SiO2/Al2O3 ratios while the strong acidity of low-silica H-ZSM-5 favors the side reactions and ZnO aggregation."

[2] "In comparison, silicalite-1 (S-1) zeolite has the same MFI topology without strong acidity. Recently, Li etal. contructed Zn-containing catalysts Zn@S-1 throngh in-situ hydrothermal synthesis for PDH reaction and the partially reduced zinc cations were identified as the active sites."

[3] "For instance, well dispersed small ZnO nanoclusters anchored in the framework of dealuminated Beta zeolite was shown with a high activity and propylene selectivity."

[4] "The S-1 supported ZnO was prepared by impregnation method."

[5] "The interaction between silanol nests and ZnO species could suppress aggregation of ZnO species under reaction conditions."

[6] "Furthermore, the presence of abundant defects makes S-1 widely used as catalyst support."

[7] "Yue etal. reported that silanol groups were important for the dispersion of active chromium and GaOx species onto Na-form ZSM-5 support in PDH reaction with silanol nests more helpful."

[1] "Ga-containing MFI catalysts also exhibit high dehydrogenation activity, while the nature of the active sites under reaction conditions as well as the role of Brnsted and Lewis acid sites is still discussed controversially."

[2] "Besides, Brnsted acid sites are important for propane dehydrogenation. Attributed to the large microporosity and Brnsted acidity, a high silica GaBeta catalyst with a Si/Ga ratio of up to 177 synthesized shows relatively good dehydrogenation performance."

[3] "In order to modify the acidity caused by the presence of aluminum, aluminum-free gallosilicate MFI without Ga introduction, has been synthesized and evaluated for propane dehydrogenation."

[4] "The obtained material shows a reduction in Brnsted acid sites and enhanced Lewis acidity, and decreasing the B/L acidity ratio is beneficial for the high dehydrogenation activity and propylene selectivity; that is, the most effective catalyst should possess a small amount of Brnsted acidity coupled with strong Lewis acid sites."

[5] "Moreover, Lewis(Ga+)-Brnsted acid pairs are identified as the active sites for propane dehydrogenation over Ga/H-ZSM-5. The increased Lewis acidity facilitates heterolytic CH bond activation, and Brnsted acidity reduces the activation barrier for the elimination of hydrogen."

[1] "The synthesis method of metal-zeolite catalysts mainly includes postsynthesis (e.g., ion exchange and impregnation) and direct synthesis (in situ introduce metal sites along with zeolite crystallization)."

[2] "Among them, the MFI and BEA topological zeolites dominate in PDH study (Tables 12), which may be attributed to their relatively facile synthesis procedure, tunable acidity, and moderate pore size."

[3] "Kumar et al. (131) synthesized a set of catalysts with identical Pt loadings and similar Pt dispersion but varied pore geometries (SBA-15, Beta, and ZSM-5). Among the investigated catalysts, Pt-ZSM-5 with the smallest pores shows the highest TOF of 0.24 s1, followed by Pt-Beta (0.21 s1) and Pt-SBA-15 (0.17 s1)."

[4] "The authors attributed the superior performance of microporous materials to the small 3D pores, which may facilitate the interaction between active sites and reactants."

[5] "ZSM-5 also enables various heteroatoms to be incorporated within its framework to anchor impregnated Pt species."

[6] "S-1 is the Al-free analogue of ZSM-5. The absence of Bronsted acid sites facilitates propylene desorption toward superior propylene selectivity compared to the counterparts with ZSM-5 supports."

[1] "HZSM-5 zeolites with varying molar SiO2/Al2O3 ratios (30, 50, 80 and 250) were provided by Tianjin Shenneng Sci-Tech Co., Ltd. The preparation procedure of Zn/xHZSM-5 catalyst as follows: 10%Zn/xHZSM-5 (Zn nominal loading is 10wt%) catalysts were prepared by conventional impregnation method."

[2] "The well-crystalline structure of high-silica HZSM-5, with high specific surface area and large pore volume, greatly promotes the Zn distributions and minimizes the sizes of ZnO particles."

[3] "ZnO supported on the high-silica HZSM-5 was found to be an efficient catalyst for PDH as compared to the ZnO catalysts on other supports (e.g. low-silica HZSM-5, silicalite-1, Al2O3 and SiO2)."

[4] "The high specific surface area and large pore volume, well-defined structure and sparse Al sites in the high-silica HZSM-5 cause Zn species distribute well throughout the support, which is directly related to the catalytic activity"

[5] "The structural properties of bare HZSM-5 zeolites with varying SiO2/Al2O3 ratios and 10%Zn/xHZSM-5 catalysts were analyzed by using of powder XRD patterns, wherein all the samples exhibit typical MFI diffraction peaks of ZSM-5 zeolite."

[6] "Clearly, four kinds of elements, including Si, O, Al, and Zn, distribute well throughout the whole selected area, revealing a good dispersion of Zn species."

[7] "The activity test results show that the catalytic performance of Zn/HZSM-5 catalyst is enhanced as raising the SiO2/Al2O3 ratio. Further increasing the SiO2/Al2O3 ratio to 1500 results in a decrease of propane conversion, suggesting there is a trade-off between framework Al atoms and active Zn species."

[8] "In combination with above characterizations, the high SiO2/Al2O3 ratio of HZSM-5 support, with low Al content and good structural properties, shows positive effects on the catalytic performance of ZnO in PDH by providing appropriate acidic condition, dispersing Zn species and having strong interaction with the supported Zn species."

"Avelino Corma and coworkers found an innovative approach that can generate Pt nanoparticles and single Pt atoms with remarkably high thermal stability, formed within purely siliceous MCM-22 during the growth of a two-dimensional zeolite into three dimensions."

"A second metal element such as Sn can be incorporated together with Pt following the same synthesis procedure. A similar situation occurred again. After calcination in air, Pt species in the K-free PtSn@MFI sample agglomerate into nanoparticles, while the Pt species in the KPtSn@MFI sample remain atomically dispersed"

"Using mineral-type precursors with exchangeable metal cations homogeneously distributed in a well-defined crystal, metal nanoparticles highly dispersed on thermally and chemically stable oxides are readily formed upon calcination and reduction."

"Xu et al. reported that in the absence of an oxidizing agent, the conversion obtained using Ga2O3 supported on ZrO2, Al2O3, and TiO2 was high, medium, and low, respectively, while SiO2 and MgO-supported Ga2O3 were inactive in alkane dehydrogenation."

"Xu et al. reported that a zeolitic support displaying a low concentration of medium and strong acid sites and a relatively high concentration of weak acid sites was found to lead to the most active and stable catalyst."

"Xu et al. reported dehydrogenation activity on both Lewis and Brnsted acid sites on GaO3/H-ZSM-5. A zeolitic support displaying a low concentration of medium and strong acid sites and a relatively high concentration of weak acid sites was found to lead to the most active and stable catalyst."

"Work on the promotion of GaOx-based dehydrogenation catalysts appears to be limited, although a patent by Iezzi et al. claims that a catalyst comprising 1.2 wt % Ga2O3, <99 ppm of Pt, and 1.6 wt % of SiO2 on an Al2O3 support represents a highly active formulation in the dehydrogenation reaction."

"Notably, the structure of the support is also important, as a mesoporous GaAl mixed oxide exhibited an increased resistance to catalyst coking."

"Several authors claim that two-dimensional polymeric V3+ or V4+ species are the most active for dehydrogenation, the vanadium species bonded directly with the γ/θ-alumina support being the most active sites in PDH."

"For example, Fujdala and Tilley have reported the use of a cothermolysis method involving several thermolytic molecular precursors to produce a Cr/Si/Zr/O catalyst capable of showing propane conversions greater than 35% and propylene selectivities exceeding 90% at 450 C."

[3] "Co-based catalysts have attracted much attention for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) because of their low price, environmental friendliness, and high activity"

[4] "Recently, Yang and Xie et al [18, 19] synthesized the Fe and Zn species incorporated into the framework of MFI zeolite by hydrothermal route and applied to alkane dehydrogenation reaction, the stabilized of Fe and Zn species by zeolite framework facilitated the catalytic activity."

[5] "Silicalite-1 was synthesized with molar composition 1.0 SiO2: 0.18 TPAOH: 18 H2O under conventional hydrothermal conditions at 170C for 2 days as described previously."

[6] "Both Co-S-1-Ar and Co/S-1-Air samples show the characteristic peaks of MFI structure at 8.0o, 8.9o, 23.2o, 23.9o and 24.3o"
