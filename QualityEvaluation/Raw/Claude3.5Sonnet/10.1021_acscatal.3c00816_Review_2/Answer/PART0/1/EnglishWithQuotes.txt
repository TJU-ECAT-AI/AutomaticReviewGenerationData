Their three-dimensional microporous nature\n          2. Smaller pore sizes compared to mesoporous materials like SBA-15\n\n          The study shows that catalytic activity for propane dehydrogenation decreases with increasing pore size, with Pt-ZSM-5 showing the highest propane conversion, followed by Pt-Beta and then Pt-SBA-15. This trend suggests that the confined space within the micropores creates a favorable environment for the PDH reaction, possibly by influencing the electronic state of the Pt or by affecting the adsorption and diffusion of reactants and products.\n\n          The three-dimensional microporous structure of these zeolites appears to induce optimal catalytic properties of Pt sites. This intrinsic nature makes them better catalytic supports for dehydrogenation of propane compared to mesoporous materials like SBA-15.\n\n          For future developments in PDH catalyst design, these findings imply:\n          1. Focus should be maintained on optimizing three-dimensional microporous structures, particularly those with smaller pore sizes like ZSM-5.\n          2. The challenge would be to balance the benefits of confined spaces with the need to minimize coke formation, which was observed to be higher in ZSM-5 compared to Beta.\n          3. Further research into tailoring pore structures and sizes within the microporous range could potentially yield catalysts with improved activity, selectivity, and stability for PDH reactions.\n          4.
