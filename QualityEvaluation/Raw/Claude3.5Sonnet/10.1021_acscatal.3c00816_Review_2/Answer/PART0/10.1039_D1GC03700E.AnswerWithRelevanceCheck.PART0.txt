          [1] "Zeolites have also been considered as catalyst supports for Cr2O3. Zhang et al. prepared CrOx/Na-ZSM-5 via incipient wetness."

[2] "Zhu et al. investigated a range of MFI supports, including silicalite-1 and H[B]MFI."

[3] "Recently, Michorczyk et al. prepared a Cr-β-zeolite and investigated the effect of dealumination, which clearly elucidated the effect of acidity on the catalytic performance."

[4] "It was reported that the dealuminated catalyst, Cr-SiBeta, exhibited significantly higher propene yields (up to 27%), compared to the Al-containing catalyst, Cr-AlBeta (2%)."

          The primary synthesis methods for metal-zeolite catalysts used in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions include incipient wetness impregnation, ion exchange, and direct synthesis. MFI (e.g., ZSM-5) and BEA (beta) zeolites dominate in PDH applications due to their unique structural characteristics.

MFI and BEA zeolites are preferred for several reasons:

1. Pore structure: Both MFI and BEA have three-dimensional pore systems that allow for efficient diffusion of reactants and products. The medium pore size of MFI (5.5 x 5.1 Å) and large pore size of BEA (6.6 x 6.7 Å) are suitable for propane and propene molecules.

2. High surface area: These zeolites provide a large surface area for metal dispersion, increasing the number of active sites.

3. Thermal and hydrothermal stability: MFI and BEA zeolites exhibit excellent stability under the high-temperature conditions required for PDH reactions.

4. Tunable acidity: The Si/Al ratio can be adjusted to optimize the acidity of the zeolite, which is crucial for balancing the desired dehydrogenation reaction and unwanted side reactions.

5. Versatility in metal incorporation: These zeolites can accommodate various metals (e.g., Ga, Cr, Pt) through different synthesis methods, allowing for tailored catalyst designs.

The effectiveness of MFI and BEA zeolites in PDH catalysts is attributed to their ability to provide a balance between metal dispersion, acidity control, and molecular transport. Their structural characteristics contribute to enhanced catalytic performance by promoting the formation of isolated metal sites, preventing metal sintering, and facilitating the adsorption-desorption of reactants and products.

Future developments in PDH catalyst design using MFI and BEA zeolites may focus on:

1. Hierarchical structures: Introducing mesopores or macropores to improve mass transfer and accessibility to active sites.

2. Bimetallic systems: Incorporating two or more metals to enhance selectivity and stability.

3. Surface modifications: Tailoring the external surface of zeolites to control the acidic properties and prevent coke formation.

4. Novel synthesis techniques: Developing methods to create single-atom catalysts or highly dispersed metal clusters within the zeolite framework.

5. In-situ characterization: Utilizing advanced techniques to better understand the catalyst behavior under reaction conditions, leading to more rational design approaches.

By leveraging the unique properties of MFI and BEA zeolites and addressing their limitations, researchers can continue to develop more efficient and stable PDH catalysts, potentially leading to improved industrial processes for propene production.

          丙烷脱氢(PDH)反应中使用的金属-沸石催化剂的主要合成方法包括浸渍法、离子交换法和直接合成法。MFI(如ZSM-5)和BEA(β沸石)在PDH应用中占主导地位，这是由于它们独特的结构特征和多功能性。

MFI和BEA沸石之所以受到青睐，原因如下：

1. 孔道结构：MFI和BEA都具有三维孔道系统，可以实现反应物和产物的高效扩散。MFI的中孔尺寸(5.5 x 5.1 Å)和BEA的大孔尺寸(6.6 x 6.7 Å)适合丙烷和丙烯分子。

2. 高比表面积：这些沸石提供了大的表面积用于金属分散，增加了活性位点的数量。

3. 热稳定性和水热稳定性：MFI和BEA沸石在PDH反应所需的高温条件下表现出优异的稳定性。

4. 可调酸度：可以通过调整Si/Al比来优化沸石的酸度，这对于平衡所需的脱氢反应和不需要的副反应至关重要。

5. 金属掺杂的多样性：这些沸石可以通过不同的合成方法容纳各种金属(如Ga、Cr、Pt)，允许定制催化剂设计。

MFI和BEA沸石在PDH催化剂中的有效性归因于它们能够在金属分散、酸度控制和分子传输之间提供平衡。它们的结构特征通过促进孤立金属位点的形成、防止金属烧结以及促进反应物和产物的吸附-脱附来提高催化性能。

未来使用MFI和BEA沸石的PDH催化剂设计可能关注以下方面：

1. 分级结构：引入介孔或大孔以改善传质和活性位点的可及性。

2. 双金属系统：结合两种或多种金属以提高选择性和稳定性。

3. 表面改性：调整沸石的外表面以控制酸性质并防止积碳形成。

4. 新型合成技术：开发在沸石骨架内创建单原子催化剂或高度分散金属簇的方法。

5. 原位表征：利用先进技术更好地理解催化剂在反应条件下的行为，从而导致更合理的设计方法。

通过利用MFI和BEA沸石的独特性质并解决它们的局限性，研究人员可以继续开发更高效和稳定的PDH催化剂，有可能改进丙烯生产的工业过程。
