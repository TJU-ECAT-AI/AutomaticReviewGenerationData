Metal-zeolite catalysts, particularly those based on MFI and BEA zeolite frameworks, have gained significant attention for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions due to their unique structural characteristics and catalytic performance. These catalysts are typically synthesized through various methods, including ion exchange, incipient wetness impregnation, and in-situ crystallization, which allow for precise control over metal loading and distribution. The MFI and BEA zeolites offer distinct advantages for PDH reactions, such as their three-dimensional pore systems, high surface areas, and tunable acidity. The performance of these catalysts is influenced by several factors, including the nature and concentration of the active metal species, the zeolite's Si/Al ratio, and the presence of promoters or modifiers. Metal-zeolite catalysts often exhibit enhanced stability and selectivity compared to traditional supported metal catalysts, owing to the zeolite's ability to confine metal particles and suppress coke formation. However, optimizing the balance between acidity and metal function remains a crucial challenge in achieving high propylene yields while maintaining catalyst longevity in PDH processes.
