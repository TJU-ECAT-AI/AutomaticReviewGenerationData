[1] "HZSM-5 zeolites with varying molar SiO2/Al2O3 ratios (30, 50, 80 and 250) were provided by Tianjin Shenneng Sci-Tech Co., Ltd. The preparation procedure of Zn/xHZSM-5 catalyst as follows: 10%Zn/xHZSM-5 (Zn nominal loading is 10wt%) catalysts were prepared by conventional impregnation method."

[2] "The well-crystalline structure of high-silica HZSM-5, with high specific surface area and large pore volume, greatly promotes the Zn distributions and minimizes the sizes of ZnO particles."

[3] "The activity test results show that the catalytic performance of Zn/HZSM-5 catalyst is enhanced as raising the SiO2/Al2O3 ratio. Further increasing the SiO2/Al2O3 ratio to 1500 results in a decrease of propane conversion, suggesting there is a trade-off between framework Al atoms and active Zn species."

[4] "In combination with above characterizations, the high SiO2/Al2O3 ratio of HZSM-5 support, with low Al content and good structural properties, shows positive effects on the catalytic performance of ZnO in PDH by providing appropriate acidic condition, dispersing Zn species and having strong interaction with the supported Zn species."

The primary synthesis method for metal-zeolite catalysts used in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions, as described in the literature, is the conventional impregnation method. This method involves impregnating the zeolite support with a metal precursor solution, followed by drying and calcination.

While the literature specifically focuses on HZSM-5 (MFI topology) zeolites, it does not directly compare MFI and BEA topologies or explain why they dominate in PDH applications. However, we can infer some reasons for the effectiveness of MFI zeolites based on the information provided:

1. Well-defined crystalline structure: HZSM-5 zeolites have a well-crystalline structure that promotes good distribution of metal species.

2. High specific surface area and large pore volume: These characteristics help to disperse metal species and minimize particle sizes.

3. Tunable SiO2/Al2O3 ratio: The ability to adjust the Si/Al ratio allows for optimization of acidity and metal-support interactions.

4. Strong metal-support interactions: HZSM-5 supports show strong interactions with supported metal species, which is beneficial for catalytic performance.

5. Appropriate acidity: The acidity of HZSM-5 can be adjusted to provide an optimal environment for PDH reactions.

The implications for future developments in PDH catalyst design include:

1. Optimizing the SiO2/Al2O3 ratio: Finding the ideal balance between framework Al atoms and active metal species.

2. Enhancing metal dispersion: Developing methods to further improve the distribution of metal species on the zeolite support.

3. Tailoring acidity: Fine-tuning the acidity of the support to maximize propylene selectivity and minimize side reactions.

4. Exploring other zeolite topologies: Investigating whether other zeolite structures can offer similar or better performance than MFI in PDH reactions.

5. Improving metal-support interactions: Developing strategies to enhance the interaction between metal species and the zeolite framework for better catalytic performance and stability.

文献中描述的用于丙烷脱氢(PDH)反应的金属-分子筛催化剂的主要合成方法是常规浸渍法。这种方法包括将分子筛载体浸渍在金属前体溶液中，然后进行干燥和煅烧。

虽然文献特别关注HZSM-5(MFI拓扑结构)分子筛，但并未直接比较MFI和BEA拓扑结构，也没有解释它们为何在PDH应用中占主导地位。然而，根据提供的信息，我们可以推断MFI分子筛有效性的一些原因：

1. 结构明确的晶体结构：HZSM-5分子筛具有良好的晶体结构，促进金属物种的良好分布。

2. 高比表面积和大孔容：这些特征有助于分散金属物种并最小化颗粒尺寸。

3. 可调节的SiO2/Al2O3比：能够调节Si/Al比允许优化酸度和金属-载体相互作用。

4. 强金属-载体相互作用：HZSM-5载体与负载的金属物种表现出强相互作用，这对催化性能有益。

5. 适当的酸度：HZSM-5的酸度可以调节，为PDH反应提供最佳环境。

对PDH催化剂设计未来发展的启示包括：
