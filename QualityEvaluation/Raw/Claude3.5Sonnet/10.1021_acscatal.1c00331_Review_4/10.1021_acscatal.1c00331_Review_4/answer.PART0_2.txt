Our understanding of coke deposition in Pt-based catalysts has evolved to recognize the complex interplay between the structure, composition, and location of cokes. However, the details of coke composition remain debated, indicating ongoing challenges in fully comprehending this phenomenon.

Primary challenges associated with coke deposition include its detrimental effects on catalyst performance and the need for frequent regeneration. The complexity of coke formation mechanisms at the molecular level also poses significant research challenges.

Various strategies have been developed to address these challenges:

1. Prevention methods: Cofeeding gas (particularly hydrogen), metal promoters, and support modification have proven effective in preventing coke formation. These methods work by removing coke precursors, weakening support acidity, and tuning catalytic properties.

2. Novel catalyst designs: Single atom/site strategies and confined subnanosized Pt clusters in zeolites have shown promise in resisting coke formation. These designs exploit size-dependent reactions and unique catalyst-support interactions.

3. Regeneration techniques: While regeneration is still necessary, research is focused on lowering regeneration temperatures to reduce costs and maintain catalyst activity.

The effectiveness of these strategies varies. While they alleviate coke formation to some extent, complete prevention remains elusive. Regeneration is still required for long-term catalyst use.

Remaining obstacles requiring further research include:
1. Developing a deeper understanding of coke formation kinetics at the molecular level.
2. Exploring coke migration mechanisms between metal and support.
3. Optimizing promoter types and loadings.
4. Enhancing collaborations between experimental and computational techniques to address the complexity of coke formation in heterogeneous catalysis.

These areas of research are crucial for developing more effective strategies to combat coke deposition and improve the performance and longevity of Pt-based catalysts.

我们对铂基催化剂中焦炭沉积的理解已经发展到认识到焦炭的结构、成分和位置之间复杂的相互作用。然而，关于焦炭成分的细节仍存在争议，这表明在完全理解这一现象方面仍面临持续的挑战。

与焦炭沉积相关的主要挑战包括其对催化剂性能的不利影响以及频繁再生的需求。在分子水平上理解焦炭形成机制的复杂性也构成了重大的研究挑战。

已经开发了各种策略来解决这些挑战：

1. 预防方法：共进料气体（特别是氢气）、金属助剂和载体改性已被证明在防止焦炭形成方面是有效的。这些方法通过去除焦炭前体、减弱载体酸性和调节催化性能来发挥作用。

2. 新型催化剂设计：单原子/单位点策略和限制在分子筛中的亚纳米铂簇在抵抗焦炭形成方面显示出promising的前景。这些设计利用了尺寸依赖的反应和独特的催化剂-载体相互作用。

3. 再生技术：虽然再生仍然是必要的，但研究重点在于降低再生温度以降低成本并维持催化剂活性。

这些策略的有效性各不相同。虽然它们在一定程度上缓解了焦炭形成，但完全预防仍然难以实现。长期使用催化剂仍需要再生。

需要进一步研究的剩余障碍包括：
1. 在分子水平上深入理解焦炭形成动力学。
2. 探索金属和载体之间的焦炭迁移机制。
3. 优化助剂类型和负载量。
4. 加强实验和计算技术之间的合作，以解决多相催化中焦炭形成的复杂性。

这些研究领域对于开发更有效的策略来对抗焦炭沉积并提高铂基催化剂的性能和寿命至关重要。
