Our understanding of coke deposition in Pt-based catalysts has evolved significantly, recognizing it as a crucial issue for commercial catalysts. The primary challenges associated with this phenomenon include:

1. Complexity of coke formation: The structure, composition, and location of cokes are interrelated, and their details are still debated.

2. Lack of molecular-level understanding: Current models provide only phenomenological descriptions, and there's a scarcity of investigations into coke kinetics at the molecular level.

3. Inevitable nature of coke formation: Despite various prevention methods, coke formation cannot be completely eliminated in processes like propane dehydrogenation (PDH).

Various strategies have been developed to address these challenges:

Prevention methods:
1. Cofeeding gas: Hydrogen cofeeding can remove coke precursors and weaken support acidity.
2. Metal promoters: Elements like Sn can tune Pt's catalytic properties, increasing activity and stability.
3. Support modification: Additives to alumina can modify acid/base strength and facilitate coke transfer.

Novel catalyst designs:
1. Single atom/site strategy: This approach exploits the different size dependence of dehydrogenation and side reactions in PDH.
2. Confined subnanosized Pt clusters in zeolites: These exhibit excellent resistance to coke formation due to unique catalyst-support interactions.

Regeneration techniques:
While not explicitly detailed in the text, regeneration is mentioned as necessary to prolong catalyst life. Some strategies aim to lower regeneration temperatures, which is important for reducing costs and maintaining activity.

These strategies have shown effectiveness in alleviating coke formation, but challenges remain:

1. Optimal promoter selection: There's a lack of guiding principles for determining the best type and loading of promoters.
2. Coke migration: Understanding and controlling coke migration from active metal to support requires further research.
3. Molecular-level kinetics: More detailed investigations are needed to understand coke formation mechanisms and transformations between disordered and graphitic coke.

Future research directions include developing novel active center designs, improving coke migration understanding, and enhancing kinetic models of coke formation at the molecular level.

我们对铂基催化剂中焦炭沉积的理解已经显著演变，认识到这是商业催化剂的一个关键问题。与这一现象相关的主要挑战包括：

1. 焦炭形成的复杂性：焦炭的结构、成分和位置是相互关联的，其细节仍存在争议。

2. 缺乏分子水平的理解：现有模型仅提供现象学描述，对分子水平焦炭动力学的研究仍然稀缺。

3. 焦炭形成的不可避免性：尽管有各种预防方法，但在丙烷脱氢（PDH）等过程中无法完全消除焦炭形成。

已经开发了各种策略来应对这些挑战：

预防方法：
1. 共进料气体：氢气共进料可以去除焦炭前体物并减弱载体酸性。
2. 金属助剂：如锡等元素可以调节铂的催化性能，提高活性和稳定性。
3. 载体改性：氧化铝的添加剂可以改变酸碱强度并促进焦炭转移。

新型催化剂设计：
1. 单原子/位点策略：这种方法利用了PDH中脱氢和副反应的不同尺寸依赖性。
2. 沸石中受限的亚纳米铂簇：由于独特的催化剂-载体相互作用，这些展现出优秀的抗焦炭形成能力。

再生技术：
虽然文本中没有详细说明，但提到再生是延长催化剂寿命所必需的。一些策略旨在降低再生温度，这对降低成本和维持活性很重要。

这些策略在减轻焦炭形成方面显示出效果，但仍然存在挑战：

1. 最佳助剂选择：缺乏确定最佳助剂类型和负载量的指导原则。
2. 焦炭迁移：理解和控制从活性金属到载体的焦炭迁移需要进一步研究。
3. 分子水平动力学：需要更详细的研究来理解焦炭形成机制以及无序焦炭和石墨化焦炭之间的转化。

未来研究方向包括开发新型活性中心设计、改进对焦炭迁移的理解，以及在分子水平上增强焦炭形成的动力学模型。
