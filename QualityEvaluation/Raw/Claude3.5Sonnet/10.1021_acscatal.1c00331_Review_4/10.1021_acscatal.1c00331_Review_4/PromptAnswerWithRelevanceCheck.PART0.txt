Our understanding of coke deposition in Pt-based catalysts has evolved to recognize the complex interplay between the structure, composition, and location of cokes. However, the field still faces challenges in fully understanding coke composition and formation mechanisms at the molecular level.

Primary challenges associated with coke deposition include its detrimental effects on catalyst performance and the need for frequent regeneration. The complexity of coke formation and the diversity of coke precursors make it difficult to develop comprehensive models and effective prevention strategies.

Various strategies have been developed to address these challenges:

1. Prevention methods: Cofeeding gas (especially hydrogen), metal promoters, and support modification have been proven effective in preventing coke formation. These methods work by removing coke precursors, weakening support acidity, or tuning catalytic properties.

2. Novel catalyst designs: Single atom/site strategies and confined subnanosized Pt clusters in zeolites have shown promise in reducing coke formation by exploiting size-dependent reactions and unique catalyst-support interactions. The geometry of the active site has been identified as a crucial factor in controlling coke formation.

3. Regeneration techniques: While various methods alleviate coke formation, regeneration is still necessary to prolong catalyst life. Efforts are being made to lower regeneration temperatures to reduce costs and maintain catalyst stability.

Despite these advancements, several obstacles remain:

1. The need for a deeper understanding of coke formation kinetics at the molecular level.
2. The lack of a guiding principle for optimizing promoter selection and loading.
3. The challenge of developing more effective coke migration strategies from active metal to support.

Further research is required to address these obstacles, potentially through collaborations between experimental and computational techniques, as well as the application of machine learning for catalyst design and optimization.

已经开发了各种策略来应对这些挑战：

1. 预防方法：共进料气体（尤其是氢气）、金属助剂和载体改性已被证明在防止焦炭形成方面很有效。这些方法通过去除焦炭前体、减弱载体酸性或调节催化性能来发挥作用。

2. 新型催化剂设计：单原子/位点策略和在沸石中confined的亚纳米铂簇通过利用尺寸依赖性反应和独特的催化剂-载体相互作用，在减少焦炭形成方面显示出前景。活性位点的几何构型已被确定为控制焦炭形成的关键因素。

3. 再生技术：虽然各种方法可以缓解焦炭形成，但再生仍然是延长催化剂寿命所必需的。目前正在努力降低再生温度，以减少成本并保持催化剂稳定性。

尽管取得了这些进展，仍然存在一些障碍：

1. 需要在分子水平上更深入地理解焦炭形成动力学。
2. 缺乏优化助剂选择和负载的指导原则。
3. 开发更有效的焦炭从活性金属向载体迁移策略的挑战。

需要进一步研究来解决这些障碍，可能通过实验和计算技术的合作，以及机器学习在催化剂设计和优化中的应用来实现。
