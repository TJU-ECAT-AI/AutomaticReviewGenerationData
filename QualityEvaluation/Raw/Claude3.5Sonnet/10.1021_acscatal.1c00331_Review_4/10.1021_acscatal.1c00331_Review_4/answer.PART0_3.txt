Our understanding of coke deposition in Pt-based catalysts has evolved significantly, recognizing it as a crucial issue for commercial catalysts. The primary challenges associated with this phenomenon include the complex interplay between the structure, composition, and location of cokes, as well as the ongoing debate regarding coke composition details.

Various strategies have been developed to address these challenges:

1. Prevention methods:
- Cofeeding gas (particularly hydrogen)
- Metal promoters (e.g., Sn)
- Support modification

2. Novel catalyst designs:
- Single atom/site strategy
- Confined subnanosized Pt clusters in zeolites
- Atomic Pt wire and Pt single atom/site surrounded by inactive elements

3. Regeneration techniques:
- Lowering regeneration temperature to reduce costs and stabilize activity

These strategies have shown effectiveness in alleviating coke formation, but challenges remain. The optimal type and loading of promoters are still undetermined due to a lack of guiding principles. Additionally, while novel catalyst designs have shown promise, regeneration is still necessary to prolong catalyst life.

Remaining obstacles requiring further research include:

1. Understanding coke migration mechanisms between metal and support
2. Developing more detailed kinetic models of coke formation at the molecular level
3. Investigating the transformation between disordered and graphitic coke
4. Utilizing machine learning to screen for highly effective catalyst candidates
5. Exploring the local environment's impact on single Pt atom/site catalysts

In conclusion, while significant progress has been made in understanding and mitigating coke deposition, further research is needed to develop more effective and long-lasting solutions for Pt-based catalysts in industrial applications.

我们对铂基催化剂中焦炭沉积的理解已经显著发展，认识到这是商业催化剂的一个关键问题。与这一现象相关的主要挑战包括焦炭的结构、成分和位置之间的复杂相互作用，以及关于焦炭成分细节的持续争论。

已经开发了各种策略来应对这些挑战：

1. 预防方法：
- 共进料气体（特别是氢气）
- 金属助剂（如锡）
- 支撑体改性

2. 新型催化剂设计：
- 单原子/单点策略
- 在分子筛中限制的亚纳米铂簇
- 被惰性元素包围的原子铂线和单原子/单点铂

3. 再生技术：
- 降低再生温度以减少成本并稳定活性

这些策略在减轻焦炭形成方面显示出效果，但仍然存在挑战。由于缺乏指导原则，助剂的最佳类型和负载量仍未确定。此外，虽然新型催化剂设计显示出前景，但再生仍然是延长催化剂寿命所必需的。

需要进一步研究的剩余障碍包括：

1. 理解金属和支撑体之间的焦炭迁移机制
2. 在分子水平上开发更详细的焦炭形成动力学模型
3. 研究无序焦炭和石墨化焦炭之间的转化
4. 利用机器学习筛选高效催化剂候选者
5. 探索局部环境对单原子/单点铂催化剂的影响

总之，虽然在理解和缓解焦炭沉积方面取得了重大进展，但仍需进一步研究以开发更有效和更持久的解决方案，用于工业应用中的铂基催化剂。
