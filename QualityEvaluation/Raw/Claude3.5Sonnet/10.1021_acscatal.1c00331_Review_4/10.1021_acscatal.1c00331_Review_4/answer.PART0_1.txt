Our understanding of coke deposition in Pt-based catalysts has evolved to recognize the complexity of the issue. The primary challenges include the entangled nature of coke structure, composition, and location, as well as the ongoing debate about coke composition details. Additionally, the lack of understanding of coke kinetics at the molecular level hinders the development of effective suppression methods.

Various strategies have been developed to address these challenges:

1. Prevention methods: Cofeeding gas (particularly hydrogen), metal promoters, and support modification have been verified as effective methods to prevent coke formation. These approaches work by removing coke precursors, weakening support acidity, and tuning catalytic properties.

2. Novel catalyst designs: Single atom/site strategies and confined subnanosized Pt clusters in zeolites have shown promise in reducing coke formation. These designs exploit the size dependence of reactions and unique catalyst-support interactions to improve resistance to coking.

3. Regeneration techniques: Despite prevention methods, regeneration is still necessary to prolong catalyst life. Some strategies aim to lower regeneration temperatures, which is important for reducing costs and maintaining catalyst activity.

While these strategies have shown effectiveness in alleviating coke formation, several obstacles remain:

1. The need for a guiding principle to determine optimal promoter types and loadings.
2. The challenge of understanding and controlling coke migration between metal and support.
3. The lack of detailed models describing coke formation kinetics at the molecular level.

Further research is needed to address these remaining challenges, potentially through advanced characterization techniques, computational modeling, and machine learning approaches to catalyst design and optimization.

我们对铂基催化剂中焦炭沉积的理解已经发展到认识到这个问题的复杂性。主要挑战包括焦炭结构、成分和位置的相互纠缠性质，以及对焦炭成分细节的持续争议。此外，对分子水平上焦炭动力学缺乏理解阻碍了有效抑制方法的开发。

已经开发了各种策略来应对这些挑战：

1. 预防方法：共进料气体（特别是氢气）、金属助剂和载体改性已被证实是有效防止焦炭形成的方法。这些方法通过去除焦炭前体、减弱载体酸性和调节催化性能来发挥作用。

2. 新型催化剂设计：单原子/单位点策略和在沸石中限制的亚纳米铂簇在减少焦炭形成方面显示出前景。这些设计利用反应的尺寸依赖性和独特的催化剂-载体相互作用来提高抗结焦能力。

3. 再生技术：尽管有预防方法，再生仍然是延长催化剂寿命所必需的。一些策略旨在降低再生温度，这对于降低成本和维持催化剂活性很重要。

虽然这些策略在缓解焦炭形成方面显示出效果，但仍然存在几个障碍：

1. 需要一个指导原则来确定最佳助剂类型和负载量。
2. 理解和控制金属与载体之间焦炭迁移的挑战。
3. 缺乏描述分子水平上焦炭形成动力学的详细模型。

需要进一步研究来解决这些剩余的挑战，可能通过先进的表征技术、计算模拟和机器学习方法来进行催化剂设计和优化。
