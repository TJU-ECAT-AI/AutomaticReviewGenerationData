Abstract
Classical strong metal–support interactions (SMSI), which play a crucial role in the preparation of supported metal nanoparticle catalysts, is one of the most important concepts in heterogeneous catalysis. The conventional wisdom for construction of classical SMSI involves in redox treatments at high-temperatures by molecular oxygen or hydrogen, sometimes causing sintered metal nanoparticles before SMSI formation. Herein, we report that the aforementioned issue can be effectively avoided by a wet-chemistry methodology. As a typical example, we demonstrate a new concept of wet-chemistry SMSI (wcSMSI) that can be constructed on titania-supported Au nanoparticles (Au/TiO2-wcSMSI), where the key is to employ a redox interaction between Auδ+ and Ti3+ precursors in aqueous solution. The wcSMSI is evidenced by covering Au nanoparticles with the TiOx overlayer, electronic interaction between Au and TiO2, and suppression of CO adsorption on Au nanoparticles. Owing to the wcSMSI, the Au–TiOx interface with an improved redox property is favorable for oxygen activation, accelerating CO oxidation. In addition, the oxide overlayer efficiently stabilizes the Au nanoparticles, achieving sinter-resistant Au/TiO2-wcSMSI catalyst in CO oxidation.

Introduction
Metal nanoparticles are dominant among heterogeneous catalysts used for technological applications, (1−5) where a general strategy for preparing heterogeneous catalysts is to load the metal nanoparticles on solids with high surface areas. The principle role of the support is to increase the metal dispersion, minimize the metal leaching, and adjust the activity/selectivity by the metal–support charge transfer and support participation in catalysis, which are all known as carrier effects. (6−10) Owing to the carrier effects, a wide scope of catalysts with enhanced catalytic activity and/or selectivity were developed and partly utilized commercially. (6−11) However, a major challenge for these catalysts is the deactivation, which results from metal sintering and surface area loss. (12−17) Regeneration of supported metal catalysts is complex and expensive, often requiring metal leaching, purification, and redeposition. (18,19)
Among the wide scope of carrier effects, capsulation of the metal nanoparticles with reducible metal oxide overlayers is very effective, which prevents their sintering by forming oxide barriers on the metal nanoparticle surface. (20−33) Generally, this phenomenon is known as strong-metal support interaction (SMSI), which was first described by Tauster et al. in the late 1970s to explain the suppressed CO and H2 adsorption on titania-supported Pt nanoparticles after high-temperature reduction treatments, giving overlayer capsulation on metal nanoparticles. (34,35) Until now, the SMSI has been extensively studied, where the excitement is to control the catalytic activity, selectivity, and/or durability by geometric and electronic modification to the metal nanoparticles. (20−25,36−40) In the modern heterogeneous catalysis, the SMSI has been regarded to be a general principle for developing alternative supported-metal nanoparticle catalysts.
A classic strategy for constructing SMSI was performed under high-temperature treatment with hydrogen on reducible metal oxide carriers, such as TiO2, V2O3, Nb2O5, Ta2O5, and CeO2, where the oxide surface was activated to make thermodynamically favorable migration of oxide overlayer onto the metal nanoparticles. (9,17,32,37) In addition, most of the research is focused on the platinum-group metals. The Au nanoparticles are believed a challenge to construct SMSI in previous experimental and theoretical investigations because of the low work function and surface energy of Au as well as the low ability for dissociation of molecular H2 to active the oxide surface. (41,42) Under this premise, a few successes have been realized to construct an oxide overlayer on Au catalysts by high-temperature calcination in molecular oxygen, which avoids the use of reductive conditions, but the supports are limited such as phosphates, (43) hydroxyapatite, (21) and ZnO. (25) These examples are regarded as new systems of SMSI because they satisfy the characteristics of oxide-layer coverage and Au-oxide electronic interaction. Recently, another success has been made in extending the concept of classical SMSI, where the additional species of HCOx was employed to construct the overlayers, denoted as adsorbate-mediated SMSI. (20) Notably, the SMSI on these successful examples was still constructed via the high-temperature redox treatments, where the metal nanoparticles might sinter into larger ones before the formation of SMSI during the high-temperature treatment, particularly for the metals (e.g., Au) with low Tammann temperature (half of the bulk melting point in degrees Kelvin). For example, the reported SMSI for supported Au catalysts usually occurred on the Au nanoparticles with diameters larger than 5 nm (21,23) because of the Au sintering under the high-temperature redox treatments. To overcome this issue, it is reasonable to expect a SMSI constructed at relatively low temperature, even at room temperature, but it is still unachieved.
Herein, we addressed this challenge by demonstrating a SMSI constructed via a wet-chemistry method in aqueous solution at room temperature. Key to the success is the construction of redox interactions between the host and guest species. A persuasive example is the Au nanoparticles on titania, a catalyst that has been extensively investigated in both synthesis and catalysis. (16,23,24,44) In our method, Ti3+ cations were employed as a strong reductant to readily interact with the oxidized surface of Au nanoparticles to form oxide thin-layer-covered on Au nanoparticles. The electronic interaction between Au and TiO2 and suppression of CO adsorption are identical to those of the classic SMSI except that it was achieved in liquor at room temperature, so defined as wet-chemistry SMSI (wcSMSI). This method avoided the conventional high-temperature redox conditions with Au sintering, realizing the oxide overlayers on Au nanoparticles with mean diameter at ∼2 nm. Owing to the wcSMSI, the redox Au–TiOx interface is favorable for the oxygen activation, accelerating the CO oxidation. In addition, the Au nanoparticles are sinter resistant in the CO oxidation for a long period. More importantly, the concept of wcSMSI is universal and can be extended to synthesize other metal catalysts such as supported Pt, Pd, and Rh nanoparticles.
Results and Discussion
Features of wcSMSI
The preparation started from loading Au nanoparticles on anatase support via a sol-immobilization method (23,45) to obtain an Au/TiO2 sample, whose high-resolution TEM image is shown in Figure 1A. The Au nanoparticles with average diameter at 2.0 nm are dispersed on anatase support (Figure S1A), where the undetectable oxide overlayers on Au nanoparticles demonstrate the lack of SMSI. For the synthesis of Au/TiO2-wcSMSI, the Au nanoparticles were pretreated with TiCl3 species at room temperature, followed by loading on anatase support. Figure 1B shows the high-resolution TEM image of Au/TiO2-wcSMSI, where the Au nanoparticle diameters are unchanged compared to that of Au/TiO2 (Figure S1B), but exhibiting an oxide overlayer covered on the Au nanoparticle.

The amount of catalyst was controlled to obtain similar CO conversions for comparison the life of the two samples. As a result, 25 mg of Au/TiO2 and 60 mg of Au/TiO2-wcSMSI were used. The red arrows in B highlight the oxide overlayer.
Figure 1C shows the CO-adsorption FT-IR spectra of Au/TiO2-wcSMSI and Au/TiO2 samples at room temperature. The spectrum of Au/TiO2 exhibits obvious bands at 2171, 2110, and 2073 cm–1, which are assigned to the gaseous CO, CO adsorbed on metallic Au nanoparticles (Au0), and CO on negatively charged Au species (Auδ−), respectively. (23,44,46) In this case, the dominant CO-adsorption band at 2073 cm–1 suggests the existence of abundant Auδ− species due to the electronic interaction between Au nanoparticles and TiO2 support, where the electrons migrated from TiOx to Au sites on the interfaces. (23,44) In contrast, the CO adsorbed on Au/TiO2-wcSMSI exhibits the bands at 2171 and 2119 cm–1 of gaseous CO and 2056 cm–1 assigned to Auδ−. The weak band of CO adsorption on Au evidences a loss in CO adsorption sites after treatment by Ti3+. Considering that the Au/TiO2-wcSMSI and Au/TiO2 have similar Au nanoparticle diameters, the decreased CO adsorption sites are reasonably assigned to the partial coverage of Au nanoparticles by the TiOx overlayer on the Au/TiO2-wcSMSI, which is also confirmed by the Au dispersion tests (Table S1), in good agreement with the phenomenon on classical SMSI. Because the Au nanoparticles are capsulated by TiOx, the CO molecules should access the Au sites through the pores/gaps on the TiOx layer. Compared with Au/TiO2, the Au/TiO2-wcSMSI exhibits a red shift in the band of CO on Auδ− (2056 cm–1), demonstrating the enhanced electronic interaction between Au and TiOx overlayer, leading to an electron shift from TiOx to Au nanoparticles on the Au/TiO2-wcSMSI. These results confirm the successful construction of oxide overlayers on Au nanoparticles, which exhibited the significant features including controllable CO adsorption and electronic interaction.
The CO adsorption on Au/TiO2-wcSMSI was further investigated via the operando FTIR spectra under various redox treatments (Figure 1C). After the Au/TiO2-wcSMSI was reduced with hydrogen at 300 °C, the CO-adsorption band was almost undetectable. It is generally known that hydrogen treatment at high temperature (>450 °C) can motivate the coverage of metal nanoparticles on titania support by enhancing the SMSI, and the low temperature (e.g., 300 °C) could not influence the oxide coverage (Figure S2), which is confirmed by the model reaction test in acetone hydrogenation (Figure S3). (20,34) Therefore, we conclude that the complete loss of CO adsorption could not result from a change in TiOx coverage but from the charge transfer on the Au nanoparticles. In the reduction treatment with hydrogen, the oxygen species on the Au sites are removed to form excessively negatively charged Au with an extremely weak adsorption ability to CO. (44) A similar phenomenon was also observed on the Au/TiO2 catalyst, where the CO adsorption was suppressed after reduction treatment at 300 °C (Figure S4). When the Au/TiO2-wcSMSI sample was reoxidized at low temperature of 200 °C, a treatment condition that is insensitive to the movement of TiOx overlayers, the excessive electrons on the negatively charged Au would partly migrate to molecular oxygen, (47,48) and the adsorption ability to CO molecule was regenerated. These phenomena confirm the electronic interaction between Au and titania with redox properties, which remarkably changes the CO adsorption.
This conclusion is further identified by the CO oxidation tests of the Au/TiO2-wcSMSI under redox treatments (Figure 2). The H2-reduced Au/TiO2-wcSMSI gives an initial reaction rate at 964.9 molCO molAu–1 h–1 in the beginning of CO oxidation. The relatively low reaction rate might be explained by excessive electrons on the interfacial Au sites from the hydrogen reduction treatment. Notably, after reaction for another 60 min, the reaction rate is effectively increased, giving 1125.7 molCO molAu–1 h–1, because the O2 interacted with the negative charged Au to partly remove the excessive electrons. When the catalyst was fully treated by O2 at 200 °C, the CO conversion rate was remarkably enhanced to 2953.9 molCO molAu–1 h–1. In this case, further reaction for longer time still gives unchanged reaction rate because of the enough interfacial oxygen. Owing to this feature, the catalytic activity in CO oxidation could be easily controlled by the redox treatments (Figures S5–S9).

Feed gas composition at 1.0% CO/1.0% O2/98% He. Feed gas rate at 50 mL/min, 50 mg of catalyst, and reaction temperature at 60 °C.
Furthermore, it is generally known that the Au catalysts are promising for CO oxidation reactions but suffer from the low sinter resistance, which hindered the practical application. (44,49)Figure 1D shows the data characterizing the catalysis life of various catalysts in the oxidation of CO using a feed gas containing CO, O2, H2O, propene, and toluene at 300 °C. The presence of impurity such as propene, H2O, and toluene fits with the harsh conditions to the emission gas from the mobile engines. (23) The Au/TiO2 gave the high initial CO conversion at 85.5% in the beginning of the reaction, but the CO conversion was continuously decreased with the reaction time, giving 69.5% after reaction for 100 h. The catalyst deactivation should be reasonably attributed to the undesired aggregation of Au nanoparticles to lose the active centers, as confirmed by the TEM characterization (Figure S10). Interestingly, the Au/TiO2-wcSMSI exhibited constant CO conversion at ∼93.0% in the reaction for 100 h with negligible deactivation. The TEM image of the used Au/TiO2-wcSMSI catalyst showed the Au nanoparticle diameter distribution at ∼2.0 nm (Figure 3A), which is similar to that of the as-synthesized catalyst. High-resolution TEM image demonstrates that the TiOx overlayers are still partly covering on the Au nanoparticles after the reaction, leading to sinter-resistant Au nanoparticles (Figure 3B).

Mechanism for the Formation of wcSMSI
Considering that the Au/TiO2-wcSMSI and Au/TiO2 have similar TiO2 support and Au nanoparticles, the SMSI on the Au/TiO2-wcSMSI sample should be reasonably assigned to the TiCl3 treatment rather than other factors. We believe that study in the interaction between Au nanoparticles and the Ti3+ precursors should benefit from an understanding of the origin of wcSMSI.
In order to avoid the influence of TiO2 support, we employed the Au nanoparticle colloid without solid carrier to interact with Ti3+ species, which was characterized by UV–vis spectroscopy because of the sensitivity of TiOx status in UV adsorption (Figure 4A). (41) The TiCl3 solution (containing HCl, pH at ∼2) gives a sole peak between 205 and 230 nm assigned to the UV adsorption of Ti3+ (Figure 4A-a). When a slight amount of NaHCO3 (the deacid reagent) was added into the liquor to decrease the acidity, the bands were broadened and shifted to 210–260 nm in the UV–vis spectra assigned to titania (Figure 4A-b–d), which should be caused by the hydrolysis of TiCl3. (42) Very interestingly, when a slight amount of Au colloid was subsequently added into the liquor, the band intensity was drastically increased, which even exceeded the detection limitation of UV–vis spectroscopy, confirming the fast formation of abundant TiOx species (Figure 4A-f). A similar phenomenon was also observed when TiCl3 solution was added into the Au nanoparticle colloid (Figures 4B and S11), confirming the interaction between Au nanoparticles and Ti3+ cations.

(A) UV–vis spectra of TiCl3 aqueous solution (10 mg/mL) under different treatments: (a) fresh, (b) 40, (c) 80, and (d) 200 μL of NaHCO3 aqueous solution (4 mg/mL) was added, and (e) 750 μL of NaHCO3 aqueous solution and 0.2 mL of Au nanoparticle colloid (0.17 mg/mL) were added into (a), (f) 0.2 mL of Au nanoparticle colloid was added into (d); (B) UV–visible spectra of various liquors: (a and b) Au nanoparticle colloid with Au concentration at (a) 0.68 and (b) 6.8 mg/L, (c–e) 40 μL of TiCl3 aqueous solution (0.37 mg/mL) was added into (c) H2O, (d) colloid a and (e) colloid b.

The Au–Ti3+ interaction was further explored by the XPS spectra. Figure S12A-a shows the Au 4f XPS spectrum of Au colloids (the Au species was loaded on a silicon slice for XPS characterization), giving the dominant Au 4f7/2 binding energy at 83.8 eV and a weak peak at 84.7 eV assigned to the metallic Au and Au+ species. After addition of Ti3+ cations, the signals of Au+ (84.7 eV) and metallic Au (83.8 eV) are extremely weak or even completely undetectable but give a dominant peak at 83.4 eV assigned to the negatively charged Au (Auδ−). (50,51) These results indicate that the Au species were reduced after addition of Ti3+ to the colloid. At the same time, the Ti4+ was detected as the sole Ti species in the Ti 2p XPS spectrum, suggesting the oxidation of Ti3+ into Ti4+ in this process (Figures S12B and S13). The reduction of Au species by Ti3+ cations easily occurred because of the strong reducibility of Ti3+ species (Figure S13). In this process, the Au nanoparticles might also act as seeds to promote the nucleation of titania species. These features benefit the formation of oxide overlayers on the Au nanoparticles, realizing the wcSMSI through wet-chemistry treatments.
Effect of wcSMSI in CO Oxidation
Because the TiOx coverage partially suppresses CO adsorption, the apparent specific rate of CO transformation over the Au/TiO2-wcSMSI is lower than that over the conventionally supported catalysts (Table S2, a general phenomenon over the catalysts with SMSI), but the average turnover frequency (TOF) of Au/TiO2-wcSMSI is higher (0.68 molCO molAu–1 s–1) than the conventionally supported Au catalyst, commercial AUROlite catalyst (52−55) (Table S2), and the normal Au catalysts with SMSI (Table S3). This phenomenon inspired us to investigate the effect of wcSMSI on the catalytic activities of Au in CO oxidation. To focus the attention onto the TiOx overlayers and avoid the influence of TiO2 support, we employed Au nanoparticle supported on inert carrier of silica (Au/SiO2) as a model catalyst and constructed TiOx overlayer on the Au nanoparticles by Ti3+ treatment (Au@Ti/SiO2-wcSMSI, Ti loading at 2.0 wt%), which was characterized by the electronic microscopy (Figures S14 and S15), XRD patterns (Figure S16), and CO-adsorption tests (Figure S17). Particularly, in the EDS elemental mapping analysis, the Au and Ti element distributions are highly constant, confirming the Ti species indeed existed on the Au nanoparticles (Figure S15).
Figure 4C gives the data characterizing the performances of various catalysts in CO oxidation. The positive role of the TiOx overlayer on Au catalysts is evidenced by the remarkably improved catalytic performances over the Au@Ti/SiO2-wcSMSI samples. For example, over 99% conversion of CO was achieved at much lower temperature (91 °C) on Au@Ti/SiO2-wcSMSI than that on Au/SiO2 (393 °C). Given the experimental points correlating the inverse of the absolute temperature (1/T) with the initial reaction rates, the apparent activation energies over the Au@Ti/SiO2-wcSMSI and Au/SiO2 were 36.2 and 74.8 kJ/mol, respectively (Figure S18). The relatively lower apparent activation energy confirmed that the CO oxidation over the Au@Ti/SiO2-wcSMSI was easier. Figure S19 shows the dependence of reaction rate on oxygen partial pressure over different catalysts. Under relatively low oxygen pressure (1.0–4.0 KPa), the reaction rates over the Au/SiO2 increased constantly with the oxygen pressure, showing a reaction kinetic order at 1.45. In contrast, the influence of oxygen pressure on r0 over the Au@Ti/SiO2-wcSMSI is very slight, exhibiting a kinetic order at 0.36. Considering that the Au@Ti/SiO2-wcSMSI solely differs from the Au/SiO2 on the existence of wcSMSI, these data confirm the TiOx overlayers accelerate the CO oxidation efficiently. Furthermore, adjustment of Ti loading amounts on the Au@Ti/SiO2-wcSMSI catalysts to 0.35, 1.0, and 3.3 wt%, the catalytic performances in CO oxidation are decreased compared with the sample with Ti loading at 2.0 wt % because fewer Ti species constructed unsatisfied Au–TiOx interfaces while more Ti species blocked the Au sites.
Operando Au 4f XPS characterization of the Au@Ti/SiO2-wcSMSI under cascade treatments by molecular O2 and H2 (Figure 4D) provided further insight into the role of wcSMSI. The O2-treated Au@Ti/SiO2-wcSMSI exhibits significant Au 4f7/2 binding energies of Au0(83.8 eV) and Auδ− (83.4 eV) with Auδ− concentration [Auδ−/(Au0 + Auδ−)] at 36%, but the value was increased to 53% by H2 reduction at 150 °C (Table S4). Exposing the sample to air at room temperature caused a remarkable decrease of Auδ− concentration to 45%, demonstrating the interaction with oxygen at mild condition. In this process, the Au@Ti/SiO2-wcSMSI exhibited almost the same Ti 2p XPS spectra associated with typical Ti4+ species (Figure S20), (23) suggesting the redox feature dominantly origins from the interfacial Au and oxygen species. Meanwhile, the reduction treatment also leads to significant reduction of the Raman mode of E1g on the Au@Ti/SiO2-wcSMSI (Figures S21 and S22), which is due to the influence of surface/subsurface oxygen on the TiOx overlayers to change the symmetry of Ti–O–Ti species. Interestingly, the intensity of the E1g mode was fully regenerated after accessing molecular oxygen at room temperature (Figures S21 and S22). These results provided evidence for the origin of reducibility and oxidizability of the Au@Ti/SiO2-wcSMSI due to the adsorbed/activated oxygen, which are regarded to be active sites for occurring CO oxidation.
These phenomena demonstrate that the wcSMSI constructed Au–TiOx interfacial sites to increase the redox property, whose catalytic importance in CO oxidation has been recognized. (56−58) Compared with the conventional supported catalyst (Au/TiO2), the catalyst with wcSMSI has achieved more significant advances with enhanced redox features, as confirmed by the almost undetectable interaction with molecular oxygen on the Au/TiO2 in Au 4f XPS spectra under the equivalent redox treatment (Figure S23).
DFT Simulation
All of the aforementioned results have confirmed the successful construction of wcSMSI to give characteristics coinciding with the classical SMSI. Following this principle, the wcSMSI is not only limited to the Au nanoparticles supported on TiO2 but also provides a proof-of-concept design to enhance the catalytic activity of the Au nanoparticles on inert support (e.g., SiO2) via the TiOx overlayer capsulation.
The previous works in SMSI investigation are mostly focused on the enhanced encapsulation and charge transfer, where the interfacial effect on the catalytic reactions is sometimes overlooked. To help identify the positive role of wcSMSI for the CO oxidation, we carried the DFT calculations by using a SiO2 supported Au55 cluster covered by TiOx overlayers with one or two atom-layer thickness to model the Au@Ti/SiO2-wcSMSI catalyst (Au55@Ti/SiO2) because it provides a reliable model of the interfacial sites at the Au-TiOx interfaces (Figure S24).
Figure 5 gives the reaction energies (ΔE) and activation barriers (Ea) for all of the reaction steps during CO oxidation over Au55@Ti/SiO2. Multiple reaction pathways have been considered, and only the structures with lowest barriers are discussed. The CO oxidation on the Au55@Ti/SiO2 starts with O2 adsorption (step B) because of higher binding energy of O2 compared to that of the CO molecule as shown in Figure S25c. It is noted that the O2 molecule was trapped at the Au–TiOx interfaces with significantly enhanced binding energy compared with Au/SiO2 catalyst. From step B to D, the adsorbed oxygen molecule reoriented to interact with incoming CO molecule and the reaction energies are all exothermic. The CO molecule can readily react with the interfacial O2 molecule to produce the O═C–O2 intermediate with a low activation energy at 0.12 eV (Figure 5, step E), which is consistent with the indication of CO adsorption revealed by FTIR measurements (Figures 1C and S17). In this case, the O2 molecule was activated as observed from the remarkably elongated O–O bond length to 1.48 Å. The O═C–O2 intermediate dissociates with an activation energy at only 0.08 eV to generate the CO2 product and isolated O sites on the interfaces (Ti–O–Au, step F). Then the resulted Ti–O–Au can react with the second CO molecule to form another CO2 (step G, H) with an energy barrier at 0.28 eV, which is similar to 36.2 kJ/mol in the experimental measurements. This step regenerates the catalytically active Au–TiOx interfacial sites to the initial status to finish a reaction cycle.

The Ti, O, Au, and Si atoms are shown as gray, red, yellow, and brown balls, respectively. Eads, Ea, and ΔE are the adsorption energy, activation energy, and energy difference, respectively.
The mechanisms of CO oxidation on the Au–TiO2 have been extensively studied experimentally and theoretically, and multiple mechanisms are proposed. (44,56−64) Oxygen activation has been recognized as the crucial step, where Au–metal oxide interfaces with redox properties are regarded to be favorable for oxygen activation. (63,65−67) In the elementary steps over the Au55@Ti/SiO2 (Figure 5), the calculated activation energy barriers for O═C–O2 intermediate formation and O2 dissolution are very low (0.12 and 0.08 eV), demonstrating the reaction easily occurred on the Au55@Ti/SiO2. When the TiOx was reduced into one atomic layer, the activation energy barrier for O2 dissolution was slightly increased to 0.24 eV, suggesting the sensitivity of TiOx overlayer for the activation of O2 (Figure S26). In contrast, the reaction over bare Au NPs without interfaces is relatively difficult, as confirmed by the high energy barriers of 0.8 eV for O═C–O2 intermediate formation and 0.71 eV for CO2 desorption (Figure S27). This result confirms the positive role of wcSMSI, which constructs TiOx overlayers on Au nanoparticles to form Au–TiOx interfaces to enhance the oxygen activation.
Apart from the aforementioned reaction steps, we also investigated the diffusion of CO molecules on the catalyst surface. Considering the CO oxidation test was performed over 0 °C, it is concluded that the CO molecules were adsorbed on the coordinately unsaturated Au sites rather than Ti sites according to the previous results. (59,61,68) As shown in Figure S28, the CO molecule is less mobile on Au. Once the CO molecules are adsorbed on the bare Au sites, a high energy barrier (∼0.8 eV) has to be overcome to diffuse to the catalytically active interfacial sites. Although the CO diffusion should be made easier on the Au surface by increasing the reaction temperature, it might influence the CO oxidation efficacy over the conventional supported Au nanoparticle catalyst (Au/TiO2). However, for the Au/TiO2-wcSMSI catalyst with the TiOx layer covered on the Au nanoparticles, the CO molecules diffuse through the gaps/pores on the TiOx layer (Scheme 1) and access to the Au sites, making the accessible Au sites on the Au nanoparticles almost interfacial sites. This structure makes the CO molecule directly adsorb on the interfacial sites, avoiding CO diffusion from bare Au atoms to the interfacial sites. This feature significantly differs from the conventional TiO2 supported Au nanoparticle catalyst, making the wcSMSI not only increase the number of interfacial sites but also minimize the CO diffusion on Au surface to accelerate the CO oxidation.

The aforementioned results demonstrate that the CO adsorbed on the interfacial sites indeed accelerates the oxygen dissolution and CO oxidation. This result is in agreement with the known results in Au–titania interfacial effects on titania-supported Au catalyst. However, the catalyst with wcSMSI has remarkable advantages compared to the conventional supported catalysts in regard to the stability of Au nanoparticles. The enhanced oxygen activation and sinter-resistant Au nanoparticles are both important for the wcSMSI. More importantly, the concept of wcSMSI is not limited to the supported Au nanoparticles but can be extended to the Pt, Pd, and Rh nanoparticles supported on TiO2, giving obvious oxide overlayer coverage on the metal nanoparticle as confirmed by the TEM images (Figures S29–31). Furthermore, when the wet-chemical method was extended to the synthesis of widely investigated Pt–FeOx catalysts, (69−71) it is not successful for construction of FeOx overlayers on Pt nanoparticles (Figure S32). Therefore, it is emphasized that the Ti3+ species with strong reducibility play a crucial role for the formation of thin overlayers on the metal nanoparticles.
Conclusion
In summary, we have demonstrated the strong metal–support interactions in titania supported Au nanoparticles achieved via wet-chemical strategy (Au/TiO2-wcSMSI). The wcSMSI was evidenced by covering Au nanoparticles with a TiOx overlayer, electronic interaction between Au and TiO2, and suppression of CO adsorption, which are consistent with those of the classical SMSI achieved by high-temperature reduction or oxidation treatment but has conceptual advances beyond it by employing the additional Ti3+ species under wet-chemical conditions at room temperature. These features might extend the concept of classical SMSI. Owing to the wcSMSI, the enhanced redox properties and molecular oxygen activation are realized. In addition, the wcSMSI also stabilized the Au nanoparticles, achieving sinter-resistant catalysis in CO oxidation for a long period. Importantly, this wcSMSI is universal and can be extended to other metals including Pt, Pd, and Rh. In addition, the methodology also provides a proof-of-concept design to enhance the catalytic activity of the Au nanoparticles on inert support (e.g., SiO2) via the TiOx overlayer capsulation.
Experimental Methods
Synthesis of Au/TiO2-wcSMSI
As a typical run, 12 mg of PVA was dissolved in 100 mL of HAuCl4 aqueous solution (0.5 mmol/L) under stirring at 0 °C for 30 min. Then 5 mL of newly made NaBH4 aqueous solution (0.05 mol/L) was quickly added into the solution under stirring. After being stirred for another 2 h, the Au nanoparticle colloid was outgassed with flowing nitrogen (30 mL/min), switched to flowing oxygen (30 mL/min) to partially oxidize the Au nanoparticle surface, and then switched back to flowing nitrogen (30 mL/min) to remove the exceeded oxygen. Meanwhile, the TiOx colloid was prepared by slow addition of 18 mg of NaHCO3 into 10 mL of TiCl3 aqueous solution (9.2 mg of TiCl3) and stirred for 3 h at room temperature.
The aforementioned TiOx colloid was dropwisely added into the Au nanoparticle colloid under stirring, followed by addition of 1 g of anatase. After being stirred for 1 h, 10 mL of H2SO4 (0.7 mol/L) was dropwisely added into the mixture and stirred for another 2 h, which benefited the maximized loading of Au nanoparticles on the anatase carrier (Figure S33). This process is known as a sol-immobilization method. Finally, the solid was filtrated, washed with 300 mL of H2O multiple times to remove the PVA species, and dried at 100 °C for 2 h and 300 °C for 1 h to obtain the Au/TiO2-wcSMSI sample.
Synthesis of Au@Ti/SiO2-wcSMSI
The synthesis procedure of Au@Ti/SiO2-wcSMSI is similar to that of Au/TiO2-wcSMSI except SiO2 was sued instead of TiO2. The loading amount of TiOx could be adjusted by changing the amount of TiCl3 in the starting solution.
The experimental details of the characterization, catalytic tests, and theoretical simulation are presented in the Supporting Information.
