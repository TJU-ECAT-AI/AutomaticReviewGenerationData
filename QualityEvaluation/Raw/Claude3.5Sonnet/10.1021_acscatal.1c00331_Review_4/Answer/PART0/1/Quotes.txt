[1] "Coke deposition is a crucial issue for the commercial Pt-based catalysts, and many efforts have been made to understand and alleviate the detrimental effects."

[2] "The structure, composition, and location of cokes are the prerequisite to inhibit coke formation. It is revealed that these factors are entangled, and the details regarding coke composition are still under debate."

[3] "The cofeeding gas, metal promoter, and support modification are the verified effective methods to prevent coke formation."

[4] "The success of single atom/site strategy wisely exploited the different size dependence of dehydrogenation and side reaction in PDH. The confined subnanosized Pt cluster in zeolite could be deposited at particular position with the unique interaction between catalyst and support, which exhibited excellent resistance to coke formation."

[5] "Although these methods indeed alleviate the coke formation, the regeneration is still needed to prolong the life of the catalyst."

[6] "The advance of novel design of active center: the geometry of active site has been verified to be a crucial factor to control coke formation."

[7] "The coke migration from the active metal to the support is a feasible way to keep activity."

[8] "Investigations of coke kinetics at the molecular level and the transformation between disordered coke and graphitic coke are extremely scarce, which hinders the discovery of effective methods to suppress coke."

[1] "Sykes et al., Pt SA/Cu SAAs with an atomic ratio of Pt:Cu = 1:1.25 exhibited excellent CO tolerance in H2 activation"

[2] "Compared to Pt nanoparticles, the Pt/Cu single atom alloys exhibited intermediate barriers for CH activation, which kept active but prevented from coking."

[3] "Gong et al. reported Pt/Cu single atom alloys could promote the desorption of surface-bonded propylene and prohibit its further dehydrogenation, resulting in high propylene selectivity ( 90%)"

[4] "Lu et al. prepared Pt single atoms anchored on Co3O4 through strong electronic metalsupport interactions, and they exhibited enhanced activity for dehydrogenation of ammonia borane [84]."

[5] "Li et al., due to the organized PtOTi3+ coordination, single Pt atoms anchored on defective TiO2 support exhibited unprecedentedly high photocatalytic hydrogen evolution rate [75]."
