Our understanding of coke deposition in Pt-based catalysts has evolved significantly, recognizing it as a crucial issue for commercial catalysts. The primary challenges include:

1. Complexity of coke formation: The structure, composition, and location of cokes are interrelated, with details still under debate.
2. Lack of molecular-level understanding: There's a scarcity of investigations into coke kinetics at the molecular level and transformations between disordered and graphitic coke.
3. Inevitable nature of coke formation: Despite prevention methods, coke formation cannot be completely eliminated in processes like propane dehydrogenation (PDH).

Various strategies have been developed to address these challenges:

1. Prevention methods:
   - Cofeeding gas (particularly hydrogen)
   - Metal promoters
   - Support modification

2. Novel catalyst designs:
   - Single atom/site strategy
   - Confined subnanosized Pt clusters in zeolites
   - Geometry optimization of active sites

3. Regeneration techniques:
   - While still necessary, efforts focus on lowering regeneration temperatures

4. Coke migration:
   - Facilitating coke transfer from active metal to support

These strategies have shown effectiveness in alleviating coke formation, but challenges remain:

1. Optimal promoter selection
2. Understanding and controlling coke migration
3. Developing detailed molecular-level kinetic models

Future research directions include improving coke migration understanding, enhancing kinetic models, and developing more effective prevention and regeneration strategies through advanced characterization techniques and computational modeling.

Our understanding of coke deposition in Pt-based catalysts has evolved to recognize it as a significant challenge that can deactivate catalysts and reduce selectivity. The primary challenges include preventing carbon accumulation while maintaining high catalytic performance.

Strategies to address these challenges include:

1. Developing single-atom alloys (SAAs): Pt/Cu SAAs have shown excellent CO tolerance and selective CH activation while preventing coking. They exhibit intermediate barriers for CH activation, allowing them to remain active but avoid carbon buildup.

2. Promoting desorption: Pt/Cu SAAs can promote the desorption of surface-bonded intermediates like propylene, preventing further dehydrogenation that leads to coke formation.

3. Tuning electronic structure: By alloying Pt with other metals like Cu, the electronic structure is modified to balance reactivity and resistance to coking.

4. Strong metal-support interactions: Pt single atoms anchored on supports like Co3O4 or defective TiO2 through strong electronic metal-support interactions have shown enhanced activity for specific reactions.

These strategies have shown effectiveness in maintaining high selectivity (e.g., 90% for propylene) while mitigating coke formation. However, further research is needed to:

1. Optimize SAA compositions for different reactions
2. Improve long-term stability under industrial conditions
3. Develop scalable synthesis methods for SAAs
4. Understand the fundamental mechanisms of coke resistance in SAAs
5. Explore regeneration techniques specific to these novel catalyst designs
6. Investigate the applicability of these strategies across a broader range of catalytic applications
