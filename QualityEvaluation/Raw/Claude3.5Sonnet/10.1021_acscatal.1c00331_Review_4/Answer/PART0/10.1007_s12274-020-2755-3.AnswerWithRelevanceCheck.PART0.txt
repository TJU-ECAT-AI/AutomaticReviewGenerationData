          [1] "Sykes et al., Pt SA/Cu SAAs with an atomic ratio of Pt:Cu = 1:1.25 exhibited excellent CO tolerance in H2 activation"

[2] "Compared to Pt nanoparticles, the Pt/Cu single atom alloys exhibited intermediate barriers for CH activation, which kept active but prevented from coking."

[3] "Gong et al. reported Pt/Cu single atom alloys could promote the desorption of surface-bonded propylene and prohibit its further dehydrogenation, resulting in high propylene selectivity ( 90%)"

[4] "Lu et al. prepared Pt single atoms anchored on Co3O4 through strong electronic metalsupport interactions, and they exhibited enhanced activity for dehydrogenation of ammonia borane [84]."

[5] "Li et al., due to the organized PtOTi3+ coordination, single Pt atoms anchored on defective TiO2 support exhibited unprecedentedly high photocatalytic hydrogen evolution rate [75]."

          Our understanding of coke deposition in Pt-based catalysts has evolved to recognize it as a significant challenge that can deactivate catalysts and reduce selectivity. The primary challenges include preventing carbon accumulation while maintaining high catalytic performance.

Strategies to address these challenges include:

1. Developing single-atom alloys (SAAs): Pt/Cu SAAs have shown excellent CO tolerance and selective CH activation while preventing coking. They exhibit intermediate barriers for CH activation, allowing them to remain active but avoid carbon buildup.

2. Promoting desorption: Pt/Cu SAAs can promote the desorption of surface-bonded intermediates like propylene, preventing further dehydrogenation that leads to coke formation.

3. Tuning electronic structure: By alloying Pt with other metals like Cu, the electronic structure is modified to balance reactivity and resistance to coking.

4. Strong metal-support interactions: Pt single atoms anchored on supports like Co3O4 or defective TiO2 through strong electronic metal-support interactions have shown enhanced activity for specific reactions.

These strategies have shown effectiveness in maintaining high selectivity (e.g., 90% for propylene) while mitigating coke formation. However, further research is needed to:

1. Optimize SAA compositions for different reactions
2. Improve long-term stability under industrial conditions
3. Develop scalable synthesis methods for SAAs
4. Understand the fundamental mechanisms of coke resistance in SAAs
5. Explore regeneration techniques specific to these novel catalyst designs
6. Investigate the applicability of these strategies across a broader range of catalytic applications

          我们对铂基催化剂中焦炭沉积的理解已经演变为认识到这是一个可能使催化剂失活并降低选择性的重大挑战。主要挑战包括在保持高催化性能的同时防止碳积累。

解决这些挑战的策略包括：

1. 开发单原子合金（SAAs）：铂/铜SAAs表现出优异的CO耐受性和选择性CH活化，同时防止结焦。它们表现出中等的CH活化能垒，使其保持活性但避免碳积累。

2. 促进脱附：铂/铜SAAs可以促进表面结合中间体（如丙烯）的脱附，防止进一步脱氢导致焦炭形成。

3. 调节电子结构：通过将铂与铜等其他金属合金化，修改电子结构以平衡反应性和抗结焦性。

4. 强金属-载体相互作用：通过强电子金属-载体相互作用固定在Co3O4或缺陷TiO2等载体上的Pt单原子对特定反应表现出增强的活性。

这些策略在保持高选择性（例如，丙烯的90%）的同时减轻焦炭形成方面表现出效果。然而，还需要进一步研究：

1. 优化不同反应的SAA组成
2. 提高工业条件下的长期稳定性
3. 开发SAAs的可扩展合成方法
4. 了解SAAs中抗结焦的基本机制
5. 探索针对这些新型催化剂设计的再生技术
6. 研究这些策略在更广泛的催化应用中的适用性
