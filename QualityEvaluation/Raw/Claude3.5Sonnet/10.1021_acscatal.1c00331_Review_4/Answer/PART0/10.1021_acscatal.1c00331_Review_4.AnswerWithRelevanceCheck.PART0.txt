          [1] "Coke deposition is a crucial issue for the commercial Pt-based catalysts, and many efforts have been made to understand and alleviate the detrimental effects."

[2] "The structure, composition, and location of cokes are the prerequisite to inhibit coke formation. It is revealed that these factors are entangled, and the details regarding coke composition are still under debate."

[3] "The cofeeding gas, metal promoter, and support modification are the verified effective methods to prevent coke formation."

[4] "The success of single atom/site strategy wisely exploited the different size dependence of dehydrogenation and side reaction in PDH. The confined subnanosized Pt cluster in zeolite could be deposited at particular position with the unique interaction between catalyst and support, which exhibited excellent resistance to coke formation."

[5] "Although these methods indeed alleviate the coke formation, the regeneration is still needed to prolong the life of the catalyst."

[6] "The advance of novel design of active center: the geometry of active site has been verified to be a crucial factor to control coke formation."

[7] "The coke migration from the active metal to the support is a feasible way to keep activity."

[8] "Investigations of coke kinetics at the molecular level and the transformation between disordered coke and graphitic coke are extremely scarce, which hinders the discovery of effective methods to suppress coke."

          Our understanding of coke deposition in Pt-based catalysts has evolved significantly, recognizing it as a crucial issue for commercial catalysts. The primary challenges include:

1. Complexity of coke formation: The structure, composition, and location of cokes are interrelated, with details still under debate.
2. Lack of molecular-level understanding: There's a scarcity of investigations into coke kinetics at the molecular level and transformations between disordered and graphitic coke.
3. Inevitable nature of coke formation: Despite prevention methods, coke formation cannot be completely eliminated in processes like propane dehydrogenation (PDH).

Various strategies have been developed to address these challenges:

1. Prevention methods:
   - Cofeeding gas (particularly hydrogen)
   - Metal promoters
   - Support modification

2. Novel catalyst designs:
   - Single atom/site strategy
   - Confined subnanosized Pt clusters in zeolites
   - Geometry optimization of active sites

3. Regeneration techniques:
   - While still necessary, efforts focus on lowering regeneration temperatures

4. Coke migration:
   - Facilitating coke transfer from active metal to support

These strategies have shown effectiveness in alleviating coke formation, but challenges remain:

1. Optimal promoter selection
2. Understanding and controlling coke migration
3. Developing detailed molecular-level kinetic models

Future research directions include improving coke migration understanding, enhancing kinetic models, and developing more effective prevention and regeneration strategies through advanced characterization techniques and computational modeling.

          我们对铂基催化剂中焦炭沉积的理解已经显著发展，认识到这是商业催化剂的一个关键问题。主要挑战包括：

1. 焦炭形成的复杂性：焦炭的结构、成分和位置是相互关联的，细节仍存在争议。
2. 缺乏分子水平的理解：对分子水平焦炭动力学和无序焦炭与石墨化焦炭之间转化的研究仍然稀缺。
3. 焦炭形成的不可避免性：尽管有预防方法，但在丙烷脱氢（PDH）等过程中无法完全消除焦炭形成。

已经开发了各种策略来应对这些挑战：

1. 预防方法：
   - 共进料气体（特别是氢气）
   - 金属助剂
   - 载体改性

2. 新型催化剂设计：
   - 单原子/位点策略
   - 沸石中受限的亚纳米铂簇
   - 活性位点几何构型优化

3. 再生技术：
   - 虽然仍然必要，但努力降低再生温度

4. 焦炭迁移：
   - 促进焦炭从活性金属向载体转移

这些策略在减轻焦炭形成方面显示出效果，但仍然存在挑战：

1. 最佳助剂选择
2. 理解和控制焦炭迁移
3. 开发详细的分子水平动力学模型

未来研究方向包括改进对焦炭迁移的理解、增强动力学模型，以及通过先进表征技术和计算建模开发更有效的预防和再生策略。
