Coke deposition remains a crucial challenge for commercial Pt-based catalysts in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) processes, necessitating significant efforts to understand and mitigate its detrimental effects [10.1021/acscatal.1c00331\_4]. The complexity of coke formation, involving interrelated factors such as structure, composition, and location, presents a formidable obstacle to developing effective prevention strategies. Moreover, the scarcity of molecular-level investigations into coke kinetics and transformations between disordered and graphitic coke further hinders progress in this field [10.1021/acscatal.1c00331\_4].

To address these challenges, researchers have explored various strategies:

1. Prevention methods: Cofeeding gas (particularly hydrogen), metal promoters, and support modification have been verified as effective methods to prevent coke formation [10.1021/acscatal.1c00331\_4]. These approaches aim to alter the reaction environment or catalyst properties to minimize carbon accumulation.

2. Novel catalyst designs: The single atom/site strategy has wisely exploited the different size dependence of dehydrogenation and side reactions in PDH. Confined subnanosized Pt clusters in zeolites, deposited at particular positions with unique catalyst-support interactions, have exhibited excellent resistance to coke formation [10.1021/acscatal.1c00331\_4]. Additionally, the geometry of the active site has been verified as a crucial factor in controlling coke formation [10.1021/acscatal.1c00331\_4].

3. Single-atom alloys (SAAs): Pt/Cu SAAs have shown promising results in balancing activity and coke resistance. With an atomic ratio of Pt:Cu = 1:1.25, these catalysts exhibit excellent CO tolerance in H2 activation and intermediate barriers for CH activation, allowing them to remain active while preventing coking [10.1007/s12274-020-2755-3]. Furthermore, Pt/Cu SAAs promote the desorption of surface-bonded propylene, inhibiting further dehydrogenation and resulting in high propylene selectivity (~90%) [10.1007/s12274-020-2755-3].

4. Strong metal-support interactions: Pt single atoms anchored on supports like Co3O4 or defective TiO2 through strong electronic metal-support interactions have demonstrated enhanced activity for specific reactions, such as the dehydrogenation of ammonia borane and photocatalytic hydrogen evolution [10.1007/s12274-020-2755-3].

5. Coke migration: Facilitating coke transfer from the active metal to the support has been identified as a feasible way to maintain catalyst activity [10.1021/acscatal.1c00331\_4].

Despite these advancements, challenges persist. The inevitable nature of coke formation in PDH processes necessitates ongoing research into regeneration techniques, albeit with a focus on lowering regeneration temperatures [10.1021/acscatal.1c00331\_4]. Additionally, optimal promoter selection, understanding and controlling coke migration, and developing detailed molecular-level kinetic models remain areas requiring further investigation.



Integrative understanding and prospective outlook: Considering the advancements and findings discussed, future research endeavors in the field of coke deposition in Pt-based catalysts for PDH should focus on:

1. Developing advanced in-situ characterization techniques to elucidate the molecular-level mechanisms of coke formation, migration, and transformation between disordered and graphitic forms.

2. Exploring novel combinations of single-atom alloys and support materials to optimize the balance between catalytic activity and coke resistance.

3. Investigating the potential of machine learning algorithms to predict optimal catalyst compositions and geometries for specific reaction conditions.

4. Designing intelligent regeneration strategies that can be integrated into continuous PDH processes, minimizing downtime and extending catalyst lifetime.

5. Exploring the synergistic effects of combining multiple coke mitigation strategies, such as SAAs with tailored support modifications and controlled coke migration pathways.

6. Developing multi-scale modeling approaches that bridge the gap between molecular-level coke formation mechanisms and macroscopic catalyst performance in industrial reactors.

These research directions aim to address the remaining challenges in understanding and mitigating coke deposition, ultimately leading to the development of more efficient and durable Pt-based catalysts for propane dehydrogenation and related processes.

Coke deposition remains a crucial challenge for commercial Pt-based catalysts in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions, necessitating extensive research to understand and mitigate its detrimental effects [10.1021/acscatal.1c00331\_4]. The complexity of coke formation, involving interrelated factors such as structure, composition, and location, presents a significant obstacle in developing effective prevention strategies. Moreover, the scarcity of investigations into coke kinetics at the molecular level and the transformation between disordered and graphitic coke hinders the discovery of efficient suppression methods [10.1021/acscatal.1c00331\_4].

To address these challenges, various strategies have been developed:

1. Prevention methods:
   Cofeeding gas, particularly hydrogen, metal promoters, and support modification have been verified as effective methods to prevent coke formation [10.1021/acscatal.1c00331\_4]. These approaches aim to alter the reaction environment or catalyst properties to minimize carbon accumulation.

   The geometry of the active site has been identified as a crucial factor in controlling coke formation. Advanced designs of active centers focus on optimizing this geometry to enhance coke resistance while maintaining catalytic activity [10.1021/acscatal.1c00331\_4].

4. Coke migration:
   Facilitating coke transfer from the active metal to the support has been proposed as a feasible way to maintain catalyst activity [10.1021/acscatal.1c00331\_4]. This approach aims to preserve the accessibility of active sites by redirecting coke deposition.

5. Strong metal-support interactions:
   Pt single atoms anchored on supports like Co3O4 or defective TiO2 through strong electronic metal-support interactions have shown enhanced activity for specific reactions, such as the dehydrogenation of ammonia borane and photocatalytic hydrogen evolution [10.1007/s12274-020-2755-3].

Despite these advancements, challenges persist. The optimal selection of promoters, understanding and controlling coke migration, and developing detailed molecular-level kinetic models remain areas requiring further research. Additionally, while these methods alleviate coke formation, regeneration is still necessary to prolong catalyst life [10.1021/acscatal.1c00331\_4].



Integrative understanding and prospective outlook: The evolution of our understanding of coke deposition in Pt-based catalysts has opened new avenues for catalyst design and optimization. Future research endeavors might focus on:

1. Advanced in-situ characterization techniques to elucidate the real-time formation and transformation of coke species at the molecular level.
2. Computational modeling to predict coke formation mechanisms and guide the design of novel catalyst structures with enhanced coke resistance.
3. Development of "smart" catalysts capable of self-regeneration or coke mitigation during the reaction process.
4. Exploration of novel support materials or promoters that can synergistically enhance activity while suppressing coke formation.
5. Investigation of the long-term stability and scalability of promising strategies like single-atom alloys and confined subnanosized clusters under industrial conditions.
6. Integration of machine learning algorithms to optimize catalyst compositions and reaction conditions for minimal coke formation.

These future directions aim to bridge the gap between fundamental understanding and practical applications, ultimately leading to the development of more efficient and durable Pt-based catalysts for propane dehydrogenation and related processes.
