Coke deposition in Pt-based catalysts has been recognized as a critical issue for commercial catalysts, particularly in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) processes. Our understanding of this phenomenon has evolved significantly, revealing the complexity and interrelated nature of coke formation factors, including structure, composition, and location [10.1021/acscatal.1c00331\_4]. The primary challenges associated with coke deposition include the lack of molecular-level understanding of coke kinetics and transformations between disordered and graphitic coke, as well as the inevitable nature of coke formation in PDH processes [10.1021/acscatal.1c00331\_4].

To address these challenges, various strategies have been developed and implemented:

1. Prevention methods:
   - Cofeeding gas, particularly hydrogen, has been verified as an effective method to prevent coke formation [10.1021/acscatal.1c00331\_4].
   - Metal promoters and support modifications have also shown promise in mitigating coke deposition [10.1021/acscatal.1c00331\_4].

2. Novel catalyst designs:
   - Single atom/site strategy: This approach exploits the different size dependence of dehydrogenation and side reactions in PDH [10.1021/acscatal.1c00331\_4].
   - Confined subnanosized Pt clusters in zeolites: These catalysts, deposited at particular positions with unique catalyst-support interactions, exhibit excellent resistance to coke formation [10.1021/acscatal.1c00331\_4].
   - Geometry optimization of active sites: The geometry of the active site has been verified as a crucial factor in controlling coke formation [10.1021/acscatal.1c00331\_4].

3. Single-atom alloys (SAAs):
   - Pt/Cu SAAs have demonstrated excellent CO tolerance and selective CH activation while preventing coking [10.1007/s12274-020-2755-3].
   - These SAAs exhibit intermediate barriers for CH activation, allowing them to remain active while avoiding carbon buildup [10.1007/s12274-020-2755-3].
   - Pt/Cu SAAs promote the desorption of surface-bonded propylene, prohibiting further dehydrogenation and resulting in high propylene selectivity (â‰ˆ90%) [10.1007/s12274-020-2755-3].

4. Strong metal-support interactions:
   - Pt single atoms anchored on supports like Co3O4 or defective TiO2 through strong electronic metal-support interactions have shown enhanced activity for specific reactions [10.1007/s12274-020-2755-3].

5. Coke migration:
   - Facilitating coke transfer from the active metal to the support has been identified as a feasible way to maintain catalyst activity [10.1021/acscatal.1c00331\_4].

6. Regeneration techniques:
   - While still necessary to prolong catalyst life, efforts are focused on lowering regeneration temperatures [10.1021/acscatal.1c00331\_4].

Despite the effectiveness of these strategies in alleviating coke formation, several challenges remain:

1. Optimal promoter selection for specific catalytic systems.
2. Understanding and controlling coke migration mechanisms.
3. Developing detailed molecular-level kinetic models for coke formation and transformation.
4. Improving long-term stability of novel catalyst designs under industrial conditions.
5. Developing scalable synthesis methods for advanced catalysts like SAAs.
6. Understanding the fundamental mechanisms of coke resistance in novel catalyst designs.


Integrative understanding and prospective outlook: Considering the advancements and findings discussed, future research endeavors might focus on:

1. Developing in-situ characterization techniques to study coke formation and migration at the molecular level during catalytic reactions.
2. Utilizing machine learning and artificial intelligence to predict optimal catalyst compositions and structures for minimizing coke formation while maintaining high activity and selectivity.
3. Exploring the synergistic effects of combining multiple coke mitigation strategies, such as integrating SAAs with zeolite confinement or novel support materials.
4. Investigating the potential of dynamic catalyst systems that can adapt to changing reaction conditions to minimize coke formation throughout the catalytic cycle.
5. Developing novel regeneration techniques specifically tailored for advanced catalyst designs, focusing on maintaining the unique structural and electronic properties of these catalysts.
6. Expanding the application of successful coke mitigation strategies to other catalytic processes beyond propane dehydrogenation, potentially revolutionizing a broader range of industrial chemical processes.

These future directions aim to address the remaining challenges in understanding and mitigating coke deposition, ultimately leading to more efficient and sustainable catalytic processes in the chemical industry.

Coke deposition in Pt-based catalysts remains a critical challenge in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) processes, significantly impacting catalyst performance and longevity. Our understanding of this phenomenon has evolved substantially, recognizing its complexity and the need for multifaceted approaches to mitigate its effects [10.1021/acscatal.1c00331\_4].

The primary challenges associated with coke deposition include:

1. Complexity of coke formation: The interrelated nature of coke structure, composition, and location, with many aspects still under debate [10.1021/acscatal.1c00331\_4].
2. Limited molecular-level understanding: A scarcity of investigations into coke kinetics at the molecular level and transformations between disordered and graphitic coke [10.1021/acscatal.1c00331\_4].
3. Inevitability of coke formation: Despite prevention methods, complete elimination of coke formation remains challenging in PDH processes [10.1021/acscatal.1c00331\_4].

To address these challenges, researchers have developed various strategies:

1. Prevention methods:
   - Cofeeding gas (particularly hydrogen)
   - Metal promoters
