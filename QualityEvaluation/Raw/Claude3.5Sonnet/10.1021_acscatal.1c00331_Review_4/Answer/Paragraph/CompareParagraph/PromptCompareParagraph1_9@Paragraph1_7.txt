4. SUMMARY AND OUTLOOK
ARTICLE SECTIONSJump To
In summary, coke deposition is a crucial issue for the commercial Pt-based catalysts, and many efforts have been made to understand and alleviate the detrimental effects. The structure, composition, and location of cokes are the prerequisite to inhibit coke formation. It is revealed that these factors are entangled, and the details regarding coke composition are still under debate. The kinetics of coke growth has an apparent importance for coke formation. Although there are several models available, none of them could resolve the mechanism at the molecular level. The cofeeding gas, metal promoter, and support modification are the verified effective methods to prevent coke formation. The cofeeding of hydrogen can remove the coke precursor and weaken the acidity of the support. Furthermore, hydrogens also aggregate the degree of coke graphitization which requires a higher regeneration temperature. The promoters, such as Sn, directly tune the catalytic properties of Pt from both a geometry and electronic perspective, which simultaneously increase activity and stability. However, the optimal kind and loading of promoter is still not concluded as there is a lack of guiding principle to govern a search. The additive to conventional support alumina can modify the acid/base strength and facilitate the coke transfer between metal and support. New developments of effective catalyst design are also noted. The success of single atom/site strategy wisely exploited the different size dependence of dehydrogenation and side reaction in PDH. The confined subnanosized Pt cluster in zeolite could be deposited at particular position with the unique interaction between catalyst and support, which exhibited excellent resistance to coke formation. Although these methods indeed alleviate the coke formation, the regeneration is still needed to prolong the life of the catalyst. Some strategies seem to be useful to lower temperature in regeneration which is important to reduce cost and stabilize activity. In the end, the collaborations between experimental and computational techniques are urgently needed to address the complicated issue in heterogeneous catalysis such as coke formation. On the basis of the previous studies, three aspects are proposed to reduce the effect of coke further:
1. The advance of novel design of active center: the geometry of active site has been verified to be a crucial factor to control coke formation. The rationale is that single Pt has been sufficient to abstract hydrogen from propane, while side reactions such as hydrogenolysis required multiple Pt&ndash;Pt site. Hence, the catalyst with a small ensemble of Pt, such as atomic Pt wire and Pt single atom/site surrounding by inactive elements, seems to be a good candidate, which may be synthesized via alloying and spatial confinement by support. (105) In addition, the local environment has significant impact on single Pt atom/site as indicated in the other single atom catalysts. (106,107) In particular, these inert surrounding coordinated species induced significant charge transfer from/to an active center, which consequently modifies the electronic structure. It is obvious that the combinations of active species and neighboring elements will be enormous. It is suggested that machine learning can be exerted to meet this challenge. The data from either experiment or computation feed into a machine learning model, which not only efficiently screens highly effective catalysts candidates but also possibly identifies a valid descriptor.
2. The coke migration: it is evident that coke formation is inevitable in PDH. To accommodate more cokes before regeneration is an effective way to extend the durability of the catalyst. The coke migration from the active metal to the support is a feasible way to keep activity. The migration is closely connected with the nature of the metal and the properties of the support, such as mobility of oxygen and structure of pores. Moreover, the interface between the metal and the support also determine the coke migration to some extent. Therefore, to resolve the mechanism of coke migration will require both experimental characterization and DFT simulation. The latter is capable to give a detailed description of metal&ndash;support interaction. (108,109)
3. The kinetics of coke formation: most available models provide a phenomenological description. Investigations of coke kinetics at the molecular level and the transformation between disordered coke and graphitic coke are extremely scarce, which hinders the discovery of effective methods to suppress coke. The difficulties are most likely originated from the diversity of coke precursor and complex network. Although it is not straightforward to extrapolate to coke on Pt, the methodologies adopted for graphene growth on a metal catalyst might be a potential candidate to supply more insights, which included large-scale kinetic Monte Carlo simulations (110−112) and molecular dynamics. (113−115)

Coke deposition in Pt-based catalysts remains a crucial challenge for commercial applications, particularly in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) processes. Our understanding of this phenomenon has evolved significantly, revealing the complexity of coke formation mechanisms and the need for innovative strategies to mitigate its detrimental effects [10.1021/acscatal.1c00331\_4].

The primary challenges associated with coke deposition include:

1. Complexity of coke formation: The structure, composition, and location of cokes are intricately interrelated, with many details still under debate [10.1021/acscatal.1c00331\_4].

2. Lack of molecular-level understanding: There is a scarcity of investigations into coke kinetics at the molecular level and transformations between disordered and graphitic coke, hindering the development of effective suppression methods [10.1021/acscatal.1c00331\_4].

3. Inevitable nature of coke formation: Despite various prevention methods, complete elimination of coke formation in PDH processes remains elusive [10.1021/acscatal.1c00331\_4].

To address these challenges, researchers have developed several strategies:

1. Prevention methods:
   - Cofeeding gas (particularly hydrogen)
   - Metal promoters
   - Support modification
These approaches have shown effectiveness in alleviating coke formation [10.1021/acscatal.1c00331\_4].

2. Novel catalyst designs:
   - Single atom/site strategy: This approach exploits the different size dependence of dehydrogenation and side reactions in PDH [10.1021/acscatal.1c00331\_4].
   - Confined subnanosized Pt clusters in zeolites: These catalysts exhibit excellent resistance to coke formation due to unique interactions between the catalyst and support [10.1021/acscatal.1c00331\_4].
   - Single-atom alloys (SAAs): Pt/Cu SAAs have demonstrated excellent CO tolerance and selective CH activation while preventing coking. They exhibit intermediate barriers for CH activation, allowing them to remain active but avoid carbon buildup [10.1007/s12274-020-2755-3].

3. Geometry optimization of active sites: The geometry of the active site has been verified as a crucial factor in controlling coke formation [10.1021/acscatal.1c00331\_4].

4. Promoting desorption: Pt/Cu SAAs can promote the desorption of surface-bonded intermediates like propylene, preventing further dehydrogenation that leads to coke formation. This results in high propylene selectivity (∼90%) [10.1007/s12274-020-2755-3].

5. Strong metal-support interactions: Pt single atoms anchored on supports like Co3O4 or defective TiO2 through strong electronic metal-support interactions have shown enhanced activity for specific reactions [10.1007/s12274-020-2755-3].

6. Coke migration: Facilitating coke transfer from active metal to support is a feasible way to maintain catalyst activity [10.1021/acscatal.1c00331\_4].

Despite these advancements, challenges remain:
1. Optimal promoter selection
2. Understanding and controlling coke migration
3. Developing detailed molecular-level kinetic models
4. Improving long-term stability under industrial conditions
5. Developing scalable synthesis methods for novel catalyst designs



Integrative understanding and prospective outlook: Taking into consideration the advancements and findings discussed in the file, there lies an opportunity to explore emerging fields and innovative methodologies. Future research endeavors might focus on:

1. Advanced in-situ characterization techniques: Developing and applying cutting-edge spectroscopic and microscopic methods to study coke formation and migration in real-time under reaction conditions.

2. Machine learning and artificial intelligence: Utilizing these tools to predict optimal catalyst compositions, geometries, and operating conditions for minimizing coke formation while maintaining high activity and selectivity.

3. Multifunctional catalyst design: Combining multiple strategies, such as SAAs with optimized support materials and promoters, to create synergistic effects for coke resistance and improved catalytic performance.

4. Green regeneration methods: Exploring environmentally friendly and energy-efficient techniques for catalyst regeneration, potentially incorporating renewable energy sources or novel oxidation methods.

5. Molecular-level modeling: Developing comprehensive computational models that can accurately predict coke formation kinetics and transformations between different types of coke at the atomic scale.

6. Tailored coke management: Designing catalysts that can selectively form less detrimental types of coke or promote controlled coke migration to non-critical areas of the catalyst surface.

These research directions aim to address the remaining challenges in understanding and mitigating coke deposition in Pt-based catalysts, ultimately leading to more efficient and sustainable PDH processes.
