Coke deposition in Pt-based catalysts: Understanding mechanisms, developing mitigation strategies, and advancing catalyst design for improved performance and longevity

Coke deposition remains a crucial issue for commercial Pt-based catalysts, particularly in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) processes. Our understanding of this phenomenon has evolved significantly, revealing the complexity of coke formation and its detrimental effects on catalyst performance and longevity [10.1021/acscatal.1c00331\_4]. The primary challenges associated with coke deposition include:

1. Complexity of coke formation: The structure, composition, and location of cokes are interrelated, with details still under debate [10.1021/acscatal.1c00331\_4].
2. Lack of molecular-level understanding: There is a scarcity of investigations into coke kinetics at the molecular level and transformations between disordered and graphitic coke [10.1021/acscatal.1c00331\_4].
3. Inevitable nature of coke formation: Despite prevention methods, coke formation cannot be completely eliminated in PDH processes [10.1021/acscatal.1c00331\_4].

To address these challenges, researchers have developed various strategies:

1. Prevention methods:
   - Cofeeding gas (particularly hydrogen)
   - Metal promoters
   - Support modification
These methods have been verified as effective in preventing coke formation [10.1021/acscatal.1c00331\_4].

2. Novel catalyst designs:
   - Single atom/site strategy: This approach exploits the different size dependence of dehydrogenation and side reactions in PDH [10.1021/acscatal.1c00331\_4].
   - Confined subnanosized Pt clusters in zeolites: These exhibit excellent resistance to coke formation due to unique interactions between catalyst and support [10.1021/acscatal.1c00331\_4].
   - Geometry optimization of active sites: The geometry of active sites has been verified as a crucial factor in controlling coke formation [10.1021/acscatal.1c00331\_4].
   - Single-atom alloys (SAAs): Pt/Cu SAAs have shown excellent CO tolerance and selective CH activation while preventing coking [10.1007/s12274-020-2755-3].

3. Regeneration techniques: Although prevention methods alleviate coke formation, regeneration is still necessary to prolong catalyst life [10.1021/acscatal.1c00331\_4].

4. Coke migration: Facilitating coke transfer from active metal to support is a feasible way to maintain activity [10.1021/acscatal.1c00331\_4].

These strategies have shown effectiveness in alleviating coke formation and maintaining high selectivity. For instance, Pt/Cu SAAs have demonstrated high propylene selectivity (~90%) by promoting the desorption of surface-bonded propylene and inhibiting further dehydrogenation [10.1007/s12274-020-2755-3].

However, challenges remain:
1. Optimal promoter selection
2. Understanding and controlling coke migration
3. Developing detailed molecular-level kinetic models
4. Improving long-term stability under industrial conditions
5. Developing scalable synthesis methods for novel catalyst designs


Integrative understanding and prospective outlook:

The evolution of our understanding of coke deposition in Pt-based catalysts has opened new avenues for research and development. Future efforts should focus on:

1. Advanced characterization techniques: Developing and applying cutting-edge methods to investigate coke formation and transformation at the molecular level, potentially unveiling the mechanisms of disordered to graphitic coke conversion.

2. Computational modeling: Utilizing advanced simulation techniques to predict coke formation, migration, and catalyst deactivation, enabling the design of more effective prevention strategies.

3. Tailored regeneration protocols: Developing regeneration techniques specific to novel catalyst designs, such as SAAs and confined Pt clusters, to optimize their longevity and performance.

4. Synergistic approaches: Combining multiple strategies, such as SAAs with optimized support materials and cofeeding gases, to create next-generation catalysts with enhanced coke resistance and catalytic performance.

5. In situ and operando studies: Conducting real-time investigations of coke formation and catalyst deactivation under realistic reaction conditions to bridge the gap between laboratory findings and industrial applications.

6. Sustainable catalyst design: Exploring environmentally friendly approaches to catalyst synthesis and regeneration, aligning with the growing emphasis on green chemistry and sustainable industrial processes.

By addressing these areas, researchers can potentially develop Pt-based catalysts with unprecedented coke resistance, selectivity, and longevity, revolutionizing propane dehydrogenation and related industrial processes.

Coke deposition in Pt-based catalysts has been recognized as a critical issue for commercial catalysts, particularly in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) processes. Our understanding of this phenomenon has evolved significantly, revealing the complexity and interrelated nature of coke formation factors, including structure, composition, and location [10.1021/acscatal.1c00331\_4]. The primary challenges associated with coke deposition include the lack of molecular-level understanding of coke kinetics and transformations between disordered and graphitic coke, as well as the inevitable nature of coke formation in PDH processes [10.1021/acscatal.1c00331\_4].

To address these challenges, various strategies have been developed and implemented:

1. Prevention methods:
   - Cofeeding gas, particularly hydrogen, has been verified as an effective method to prevent coke formation [10.1021/acscatal.1c00331\_4].
   - Metal promoters and support modifications have also shown promise in mitigating coke deposition [10.1021/acscatal.1c00331\_4].

2. Novel catalyst designs:
   - Single atom/site strategy: This approach exploits the different size dependence of dehydrogenation and side reactions in PDH [10.1021/acscatal.1c00331\_4].
   - Confined subnanosized Pt clusters in zeolites: These catalysts, deposited at particular positions with unique catalyst-support interactions, exhibit excellent resistance to coke formation [10.1021/acscatal.1c00331\_4].
   - Geometry optimization of active sites: The geometry of the active site has been verified as a crucial factor in controlling coke formation [10.1021/acscatal.1c00331\_4].

3. Single-atom alloys (SAAs):
   - Pt/Cu SAAs have demonstrated excellent CO tolerance and selective CH activation while preventing coking [10.1007/s12274-020-2755-3].
   - These SAAs exhibit intermediate barriers for CH activation, allowing them to remain active while avoiding carbon buildup [10.1007/s12274-020-2755-3].
   - Pt/Cu SAAs promote the desorption of surface-bonded propylene, prohibiting further dehydrogenation and resulting in high propylene selectivity (≈90%) [10.1007/s12274-020-2755-3].

4. Strong metal-support interactions:
   - Pt single atoms anchored on supports like Co3O4 or defective TiO2 through strong electronic metal-support interactions have shown enhanced activity for specific reactions [10.1007/s12274-020-2755-3].

5. Coke migration:
   - Facilitating coke transfer from the active metal to the support has been identified as a feasible way to maintain catalyst activity [10.1021/acscatal.1c00331\_4].

6. Regeneration techniques:
   - While still necessary to prolong catalyst life, efforts are focused on lowering regeneration temperatures [10.1021/acscatal.1c00331\_4].

Despite the effectiveness of these strategies in alleviating coke formation, several challenges remain:

1. Optimal promoter selection for specific catalytic systems.
2. Understanding and controlling coke migration mechanisms.
3. Developing detailed molecular-level kinetic models for coke formation and transformation.
4. Improving long-term stability of novel catalyst designs under industrial conditions.
5. Developing scalable synthesis methods for advanced catalysts like SAAs.
6. Understanding the fundamental mechanisms of coke resistance in novel catalyst designs.


Integrative understanding and prospective outlook: Considering the advancements and findings discussed, future research endeavors might focus on:

1. Developing in-situ characterization techniques to study coke formation and migration at the molecular level during catalytic reactions.
2. Utilizing machine learning and artificial intelligence to predict optimal catalyst compositions and structures for minimizing coke formation while maintaining high activity and selectivity.
3. Exploring the synergistic effects of combining multiple coke mitigation strategies, such as integrating SAAs with zeolite confinement or novel support materials.
4. Investigating the potential of dynamic catalyst systems that can adapt to changing reaction conditions to minimize coke formation throughout the catalytic cycle.
5. Developing novel regeneration techniques specifically tailored for advanced catalyst designs, focusing on maintaining the unique structural and electronic properties of these catalysts.
6. Expanding the application of successful coke mitigation strategies to other catalytic processes beyond propane dehydrogenation, potentially revolutionizing a broader range of industrial chemical processes.

These future directions aim to address the remaining challenges in understanding and mitigating coke deposition, ultimately leading to more efficient and sustainable catalytic processes in the chemical industry.
