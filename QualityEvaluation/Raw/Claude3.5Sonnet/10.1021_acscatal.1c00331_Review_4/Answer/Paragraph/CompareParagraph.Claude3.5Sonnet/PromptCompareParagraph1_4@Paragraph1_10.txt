Coke deposition in Pt-based catalysts remains a critical challenge in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) processes, significantly impacting catalyst performance and longevity. Our understanding of this phenomenon has evolved substantially, recognizing it as a complex issue with interrelated factors such as structure, composition, and location of coke deposits [10.1021/acscatal.1c00331\_4]. The primary challenges in addressing coke deposition include its inherent complexity, the lack of molecular-level understanding, and the inevitable nature of coke formation in PDH processes [10.1021/acscatal.1c00331\_4].

To mitigate these challenges, researchers have developed various strategies:

1. Prevention methods:
   - Cofeeding gas, particularly hydrogen, has been verified as an effective method to prevent coke formation [10.1021/acscatal.1c00331\_4].
   - Metal promoters and support modifications have shown promise in alleviating coke deposition [10.1021/acscatal.1c00331\_4].

2. Novel catalyst designs:
   - Single atom/site strategy: This approach exploits the different size dependence of dehydrogenation and side reactions in PDH [10.1021/acscatal.1c00331\_4]. For instance, Pt/Cu single-atom alloys (SAAs) have demonstrated excellent CO tolerance and selective CH activation while preventing coking [10.1007/s12274-020-2755-3].
   - Confined subnanosized Pt clusters in zeolites: These catalysts, deposited at particular positions with unique catalyst-support interactions, exhibit excellent resistance to coke formation [10.1021/acscatal.1c00331\_4].
   - Geometry optimization of active sites: The geometry of the active site has been verified as a crucial factor in controlling coke formation [10.1021/acscatal.1c00331\_4].

3. Regeneration techniques:
   - While still necessary to prolong catalyst life, efforts focus on lowering regeneration temperatures [10.1021/acscatal.1c00331\_4].

4. Coke migration:
   - Facilitating coke transfer from the active metal to the support has been identified as a feasible way to maintain activity [10.1021/acscatal.1c00331\_4].

These strategies have shown effectiveness in alleviating coke formation and maintaining high selectivity. For example, Pt/Cu SAAs can promote the desorption of surface-bonded propylene and prohibit its further dehydrogenation, resulting in high propylene selectivity (~90%) [10.1007/s12274-020-2755-3].

However, several challenges remain:
1. Optimal promoter selection for different reaction conditions.
2. Understanding and controlling coke migration mechanisms.
3. Developing detailed molecular-level kinetic models, particularly for the transformation between disordered and graphitic coke [10.1021/acscatal.1c00331\_4].


Integrative understanding and prospective outlook: The evolution of our understanding of coke deposition in Pt-based catalysts has opened up new avenues for research and development. Future efforts may focus on:

1. Advanced in-situ characterization techniques to elucidate the real-time formation and migration of coke deposits at the molecular level.
2. Computational modeling to predict coke formation mechanisms and guide the design of novel catalyst structures.
3. Exploring hybrid approaches that combine multiple strategies, such as SAAs with optimized support materials, to synergistically combat coke deposition.
4. Developing "smart" catalysts that can self-regenerate or actively resist coke formation through dynamic structural changes.
5. Investigating the potential of emerging materials, such as 2D materials or metal-organic frameworks, as supports or co-catalysts to enhance coke resistance.
6. Studying the long-term stability and scalability of novel catalyst designs under industrial conditions to bridge the gap between laboratory research and practical applications.

These research directions could potentially lead to breakthroughs in catalyst design, significantly improving the efficiency and sustainability of propane dehydrogenation processes and other related catalytic applications.

Coke deposition is a significant challenge in Pt-based catalysts, impacting their performance and longevity in various industrial processes. This phenomenon occurs when carbon-rich deposits accumulate on the catalyst surface, blocking active sites and reducing catalytic efficiency. Understanding the mechanisms behind coke formation is crucial for developing effective mitigation strategies. Researchers are investigating factors such as temperature, pressure, and feedstock composition that contribute to coking. Advanced characterization techniques, including in-situ spectroscopy and microscopy, are being employed to observe coke formation in real-time. Armed with this knowledge, scientists are exploring innovative approaches to enhance catalyst resistance to coking, such as modifying catalyst supports, incorporating promoters, and optimizing reaction conditions. Additionally, novel catalyst designs are being developed, focusing on nanostructured materials and bimetallic formulations that exhibit improved coke resistance. These advancements in understanding and mitigating coke deposition are paving the way for more efficient and durable Pt-based catalysts, ultimately benefiting industries ranging from petroleum refining to fuel cell technology.
