Coke deposition in Pt-based catalysts: Understanding mechanisms, developing mitigation strategies, and advancing catalyst design for improved performance and longevity

Coke deposition remains a crucial issue for commercial Pt-based catalysts, particularly in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) processes. Our understanding of this phenomenon has evolved significantly, revealing the complexity of coke formation and its detrimental effects on catalyst performance and longevity [10.1021/acscatal.1c00331\_4]. The primary challenges associated with coke deposition include:

1. Complexity of coke formation: The structure, composition, and location of cokes are interrelated, with details still under debate [10.1021/acscatal.1c00331\_4].
2. Lack of molecular-level understanding: There is a scarcity of investigations into coke kinetics at the molecular level and transformations between disordered and graphitic coke [10.1021/acscatal.1c00331\_4].
3. Inevitable nature of coke formation: Despite prevention methods, coke formation cannot be completely eliminated in PDH processes [10.1021/acscatal.1c00331\_4].

To address these challenges, researchers have developed various strategies:

1. Prevention methods:
   - Cofeeding gas (particularly hydrogen)
   - Metal promoters
   - Support modification
These methods have been verified as effective in preventing coke formation [10.1021/acscatal.1c00331\_4].

2. Novel catalyst designs:
   - Single atom/site strategy: This approach exploits the different size dependence of dehydrogenation and side reactions in PDH [10.1021/acscatal.1c00331\_4].
   - Confined subnanosized Pt clusters in zeolites: These exhibit excellent resistance to coke formation due to unique interactions between catalyst and support [10.1021/acscatal.1c00331\_4].
   - Geometry optimization of active sites: The geometry of active sites has been verified as a crucial factor in controlling coke formation [10.1021/acscatal.1c00331\_4].
   - Single-atom alloys (SAAs): Pt/Cu SAAs have shown excellent CO tolerance and selective CH activation while preventing coking [10.1007/s12274-020-2755-3].

3. Regeneration techniques: Although prevention methods alleviate coke formation, regeneration is still necessary to prolong catalyst life [10.1021/acscatal.1c00331\_4].

4. Coke migration: Facilitating coke transfer from active metal to support is a feasible way to maintain activity [10.1021/acscatal.1c00331\_4].

These strategies have shown effectiveness in alleviating coke formation and maintaining high selectivity. For instance, Pt/Cu SAAs have demonstrated high propylene selectivity (~90%) by promoting the desorption of surface-bonded propylene and inhibiting further dehydrogenation [10.1007/s12274-020-2755-3].

However, challenges remain:
1. Optimal promoter selection
2. Understanding and controlling coke migration
3. Developing detailed molecular-level kinetic models
4. Improving long-term stability under industrial conditions
5. Developing scalable synthesis methods for novel catalyst designs


Integrative understanding and prospective outlook:

The evolution of our understanding of coke deposition in Pt-based catalysts has opened new avenues for research and development. Future efforts should focus on:

1. Advanced characterization techniques: Developing and applying cutting-edge methods to investigate coke formation and transformation at the molecular level, potentially unveiling the mechanisms of disordered to graphitic coke conversion.

2. Computational modeling: Utilizing advanced simulation techniques to predict coke formation, migration, and catalyst deactivation, enabling the design of more effective prevention strategies.

3. Tailored regeneration protocols: Developing regeneration techniques specific to novel catalyst designs, such as SAAs and confined Pt clusters, to optimize their longevity and performance.

4. Synergistic approaches: Combining multiple strategies, such as SAAs with optimized support materials and cofeeding gases, to create next-generation catalysts with enhanced coke resistance and catalytic performance.

5. In situ and operando studies: Conducting real-time investigations of coke formation and catalyst deactivation under realistic reaction conditions to bridge the gap between laboratory findings and industrial applications.

6. Sustainable catalyst design: Exploring environmentally friendly approaches to catalyst synthesis and regeneration, aligning with the growing emphasis on green chemistry and sustainable industrial processes.

By addressing these areas, researchers can potentially develop Pt-based catalysts with unprecedented coke resistance, selectivity, and longevity, revolutionizing propane dehydrogenation and related industrial processes.

Coke deposition in Pt-based catalysts remains a critical challenge in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) processes, significantly impacting catalyst performance and longevity.

2. Understanding and controlling coke migration mechanisms.
3. Developing detailed molecular-level kinetic models, particularly for the transformation between disordered and graphitic coke [10.1021/acscatal.1c00331\_4].


Integrative understanding and prospective outlook: The evolution of our understanding of coke deposition in Pt-based catalysts has opened up new avenues for research and development. Future efforts may focus on:

1. Advanced in-situ characterization techniques to elucidate the real-time formation and migration of coke deposits at the molecular level.
2. Computational modeling to predict coke formation mechanisms and guide the design of novel catalyst structures.
3. Exploring hybrid approaches that combine multiple strategies, such as SAAs with optimized support materials, to synergistically combat coke deposition.
4. Developing "smart" catalysts that can self-regenerate or actively resist coke formation through dynamic structural changes.
5. Investigating the potential of emerging materials, such as 2D materials or metal-organic frameworks, as supports or co-catalysts to enhance coke resistance.
6. Studying the long-term stability and scalability of novel catalyst designs under industrial conditions to bridge the gap between laboratory research and practical applications.

These research directions could potentially lead to breakthroughs in catalyst design, significantly improving the efficiency and sustainability of propane dehydrogenation processes and other related catalytic applications.
