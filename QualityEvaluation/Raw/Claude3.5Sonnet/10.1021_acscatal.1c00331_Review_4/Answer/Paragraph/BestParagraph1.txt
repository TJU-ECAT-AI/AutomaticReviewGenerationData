Coke deposition in Pt-based catalysts for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) has been recognized as a crucial issue affecting the performance and longevity of commercial catalysts [10.1021/acscatal.1c00331_4]. The complexity of coke formation, involving interrelated factors such as structure, composition, and location, presents significant challenges in developing effective mitigation strategies [10.1021/acscatal.1c00331_4]. Moreover, the lack of molecular-level understanding of coke kinetics and transformations between disordered and graphitic coke hinders the discovery of more efficient methods to suppress coke formation [10.1021/acscatal.1c00331_4].

To address these challenges, researchers have developed various strategies:

1. Prevention methods:
   Cofeeding gas (particularly hydrogen), metal promoters, and support modification have been verified as effective methods to prevent coke formation [10.1021/acscatal.1c00331_4]. These approaches aim to alter the reaction environment or catalyst properties to minimize coke precursor formation.

2. Novel catalyst designs:
   The single atom/site strategy has successfully exploited the different size dependence of dehydrogenation and side reactions in PDH [10.1021/acscatal.1c00331_4]. Confined subnanosized Pt clusters in zeolites, deposited at particular positions with unique catalyst-support interactions, have exhibited excellent resistance to coke formation [10.1021/acscatal.1c00331_4]. Additionally, the geometry of active sites has been verified as a crucial factor in controlling coke formation [10.1021/acscatal.1c00331_4].

   Single-atom alloys (SAAs) have emerged as a promising approach. Pt/Cu SAAs with an atomic ratio of Pt:Cu = 1:1.25 have shown excellent CO tolerance in H2 activation [10.1007/s12274-020-2755-3]. These SAAs exhibit intermediate barriers for CH activation, maintaining activity while preventing coking [10.1007/s12274-020-2755-3]. Furthermore, Pt/Cu SAAs promote the desorption of surface-bonded propylene, inhibiting further dehydrogenation and resulting in high propylene selectivity of approximately 90% [10.1007/s12274-020-2755-3].

3. Strong metal-support interactions:
   Pt single atoms anchored on supports like Co3O4 through strong electronic metal-support interactions have demonstrated enhanced activity for specific reactions, such as the dehydrogenation of ammonia borane [10.1007/s12274-020-2755-3]. Similarly, single Pt atoms anchored on defective TiO2 support, due to organized PtOTi3+ coordination, exhibited unprecedentedly high photocatalytic hydrogen evolution rates [10.1007/s12274-020-2755-3].

4. Coke migration:
   Facilitating coke transfer from the active metal to the support has been identified as a feasible way to maintain catalyst activity [10.1021/acscatal.1c00331_4]. This approach allows for the continuous operation of the catalyst by preventing the accumulation of coke on active sites.

5. Regeneration techniques:
   Although prevention methods have shown promise in alleviating coke formation, regeneration is still necessary to prolong catalyst life [10.1021/acscatal.1c00331_4]. Current efforts focus on lowering regeneration temperatures to minimize thermal stress on the catalyst.

Despite these advancements, several challenges remain:
1. Optimal promoter selection for different catalyst systems and reaction conditions.
2. Understanding and controlling coke migration mechanisms.
3. Developing detailed molecular-level kinetic models to predict and prevent coke formation.
4. Improving the long-term stability of novel catalyst designs under industrial conditions.
5. Developing scalable synthesis methods for advanced catalysts like SAAs.

※※※

Integrative understanding and prospective outlook: The evolution of our understanding of coke deposition in Pt-based catalysts has led to significant advancements in catalyst design and mitigation strategies. However, there are still numerous opportunities for further research and development in this field.

Future research endeavors might focus on:

1. Advanced in-situ characterization techniques: Developing and applying cutting-edge spectroscopic and microscopic methods to study coke formation and migration in real-time under reaction conditions. This could provide unprecedented insights into the molecular-level mechanisms of coke formation and transformation.

2. Machine learning and artificial intelligence: Utilizing these tools to analyze large datasets of catalyst performance, composition, and reaction conditions to identify optimal catalyst designs and operating parameters for minimizing coke formation.

3. Multiscale modeling: Integrating molecular simulations with reactor-scale models to predict coke formation and catalyst deactivation over extended periods, enabling the design of more robust and long-lasting catalysts.

4. Hybrid materials: Exploring the synergistic effects of combining different catalyst designs, such as incorporating single-atom sites into zeolite frameworks or developing hierarchical porous structures to optimize mass transport and coke resistance.

5. Green regeneration methods: Investigating environmentally friendly and energy-efficient regeneration techniques, such as plasma-assisted or electrochemical regeneration, to reduce the carbon footprint of catalyst recycling processes.

6. Catalyst design for circular economy: Developing catalysts that not only resist coke formation but also facilitate the conversion of deposited carbon into valuable products, turning a waste product into a resource.

These research directions have the potential to revolutionize the field of propane dehydrogenation catalysis, leading to more efficient, stable, and sustainable processes for the production of valuable chemical intermediates.
