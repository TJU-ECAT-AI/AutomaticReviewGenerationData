Coke deposition in Pt-based catalysts: Understanding mechanisms, developing mitigation strategies, and advancing catalyst design for improved performance and longevity

Coke deposition remains a crucial issue for commercial Pt-based catalysts, particularly in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) processes. Our understanding of this phenomenon has evolved significantly, revealing the complexity of coke formation and its detrimental effects on catalyst performance and longevity [10.1021/acscatal.1c00331_4]. The primary challenges associated with coke deposition include:

1. Complexity of coke formation: The structure, composition, and location of cokes are interrelated, with details still under debate [10.1021/acscatal.1c00331_4].
2. Lack of molecular-level understanding: There is a scarcity of investigations into coke kinetics at the molecular level and transformations between disordered and graphitic coke [10.1021/acscatal.1c00331_4].
3. Inevitable nature of coke formation: Despite prevention methods, coke formation cannot be completely eliminated in PDH processes [10.1021/acscatal.1c00331_4].

To address these challenges, researchers have developed various strategies:

1. Prevention methods:
   - Cofeeding gas (particularly hydrogen)
   - Metal promoters
   - Support modification
These methods have been verified as effective in preventing coke formation [10.1021/acscatal.1c00331_4].

2. Novel catalyst designs:
   - Single atom/site strategy: This approach exploits the different size dependence of dehydrogenation and side reactions in PDH [10.1021/acscatal.1c00331_4].
   - Confined subnanosized Pt clusters in zeolites: These exhibit excellent resistance to coke formation due to unique interactions between catalyst and support [10.1021/acscatal.1c00331_4].
   - Geometry optimization of active sites: The geometry of active sites has been verified as a crucial factor in controlling coke formation [10.1021/acscatal.1c00331_4].
   - Single-atom alloys (SAAs): Pt/Cu SAAs have shown excellent CO tolerance and selective CH activation while preventing coking [10.1007/s12274-020-2755-3].

3. Regeneration techniques: Although prevention methods alleviate coke formation, regeneration is still necessary to prolong catalyst life [10.1021/acscatal.1c00331_4].

4. Coke migration: Facilitating coke transfer from active metal to support is a feasible way to maintain activity [10.1021/acscatal.1c00331_4].

These strategies have shown effectiveness in alleviating coke formation and maintaining high selectivity. For instance, Pt/Cu SAAs have demonstrated high propylene selectivity (~90%) by promoting the desorption of surface-bonded propylene and inhibiting further dehydrogenation [10.1007/s12274-020-2755-3].

However, challenges remain:
1. Optimal promoter selection
2. Understanding and controlling coke migration
3. Developing detailed molecular-level kinetic models
4. Improving long-term stability under industrial conditions
5. Developing scalable synthesis methods for novel catalyst designs

※※※
Integrative understanding and prospective outlook:

The evolution of our understanding of coke deposition in Pt-based catalysts has opened new avenues for research and development. Future efforts should focus on:

1. Advanced characterization techniques: Developing and applying cutting-edge methods to investigate coke formation and transformation at the molecular level, potentially unveiling the mechanisms of disordered to graphitic coke conversion.

2. Computational modeling: Utilizing advanced simulation techniques to predict coke formation, migration, and catalyst deactivation, enabling the design of more effective prevention strategies.

3. Tailored regeneration protocols: Developing regeneration techniques specific to novel catalyst designs, such as SAAs and confined Pt clusters, to optimize their longevity and performance.

4. Synergistic approaches: Combining multiple strategies, such as SAAs with optimized support materials and cofeeding gases, to create next-generation catalysts with enhanced coke resistance and catalytic performance.

5. In situ and operando studies: Conducting real-time investigations of coke formation and catalyst deactivation under realistic reaction conditions to bridge the gap between laboratory findings and industrial applications.

   Cofeeding gas (particularly hydrogen), metal promoters, and support modification have been verified as effective methods to prevent coke formation [10.1021/acscatal.1c00331_4]. These approaches aim to alter the reaction environment or catalyst properties to minimize coke precursor formation.

2. Novel catalyst designs:
   The single atom/site strategy has successfully exploited the different size dependence of dehydrogenation and side reactions in PDH [10.1021/acscatal.1c00331_4].

Additionally, the geometry of active sites has been verified as a crucial factor in controlling coke formation [10.1021/acscatal.1c00331_4].

   Single-atom alloys (SAAs) have emerged as a promising approach. Pt/Cu SAAs with an atomic ratio of Pt:Cu = 1:1.25 have shown excellent CO tolerance in H2 activation [10.1007/s12274-020-2755-3]. These SAAs exhibit intermediate barriers for CH activation, maintaining activity while preventing coking [10.1007/s12274-020-2755-3]. Furthermore, Pt/Cu SAAs promote the desorption of surface-bonded propylene, inhibiting further dehydrogenation and resulting in high propylene selectivity of approximately 90% [10.1007/s12274-020-2755-3].

3. Strong metal-support interactions:
   Pt single atoms anchored on supports like Co3O4 through strong electronic metal-support interactions have demonstrated enhanced activity for specific reactions, such as the dehydrogenation of ammonia borane [10.1007/s12274-020-2755-3]. Similarly, single Pt atoms anchored on defective TiO2 support, due to organized PtOTi3+ coordination, exhibited unprecedentedly high photocatalytic hydrogen evolution rates [10.1007/s12274-020-2755-3].

4. Coke migration:
   Facilitating coke transfer from the active metal to the support has been identified as a feasible way to maintain catalyst activity [10.1021/acscatal.1c00331_4]. This approach allows for the continuous operation of the catalyst by preventing the accumulation of coke on active sites.

5. Regeneration techniques:
   Although prevention methods have shown promise in alleviating coke formation, regeneration is still necessary to prolong catalyst life [10.1021/acscatal.1c00331_4]. Current efforts focus on lowering regeneration temperatures to minimize thermal stress on the catalyst.

Despite these advancements, several challenges remain:
1. Optimal promoter selection for different catalyst systems and reaction conditions.

For instance, Pt/Cu SAAs with an atomic ratio of Pt:Cu = 1:1.25 demonstrated excellent CO tolerance in H2 activation and exhibited intermediate barriers for CH activation, maintaining activity while preventing coking [10.1007/s12274-020-2755-3].

3. Geometry optimization:
   The geometry of the active site has been identified as a crucial factor in controlling coke formation. Advanced designs of active centers focus on optimizing this geometry to enhance coke resistance while maintaining catalytic activity [10.1021/acscatal.1c00331_4].

4. Coke migration:
   Facilitating coke transfer from the active metal to the support has been proposed as a feasible way to maintain catalyst activity [10.1021/acscatal.1c00331_4]. This approach aims to preserve the accessibility of active sites by redirecting coke deposition.

5. Strong metal-support interactions:
   Pt single atoms anchored on supports like Co3O4 or defective TiO2 through strong electronic metal-support interactions have shown enhanced activity for specific reactions, such as the dehydrogenation of ammonia borane and photocatalytic hydrogen evolution [10.1007/s12274-020-2755-3].

Despite these advancements, challenges persist. The optimal selection of promoters, understanding and controlling coke migration, and developing detailed molecular-level kinetic models remain areas requiring further research. Additionally, while these methods alleviate coke formation, regeneration is still necessary to prolong catalyst life [10.1021/acscatal.1c00331_4].
