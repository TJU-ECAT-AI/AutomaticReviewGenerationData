The given literature does not contain any information relevant to coke deposition in Pt-based catalysts, its challenges, prevention methods, novel catalyst designs, or regeneration techniques. The document appears to be about molecular dynamics simulation of graphene growth on a Ni surface, which is unrelated to the question asked. Therefore, this question cannot be answered based on the provided text.

所提供的文献中没有任何与Pt基催化剂中焦炭沉积、其挑战、预防方法、新型催化剂设计或再生技术相关的信息。这篇文档似乎是关于镍表面石墨烯生长的分子动力学模拟，与所问的问题无关。因此，无法根据提供的文本回答这个问题。
