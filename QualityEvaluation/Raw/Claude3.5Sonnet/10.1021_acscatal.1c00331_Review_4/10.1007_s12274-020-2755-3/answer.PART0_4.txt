Our understanding of coke deposition in Pt-based catalysts has evolved to recognize it as a major challenge that reduces catalytic activity and selectivity. The primary challenges are preventing carbon accumulation while maintaining high catalytic performance.

Strategies to address these challenges include:

1. Developing single-atom alloys (SAAs): Pt/Cu SAAs have shown excellent CO tolerance and selective CH activation while preventing coking. They exhibit intermediate barriers for CH activation, allowing them to remain active but avoid carbon buildup.

2. Promoting desorption: Pt/Cu SAAs can promote the desorption of surface-bonded intermediates like propylene, preventing further dehydrogenation that leads to coke formation.

3. Tuning electronic structure: By alloying Pt with other metals like Cu, the electronic structure is modified to balance reactivity and resistance to coking.

These strategies have shown effectiveness in maintaining high selectivity (e.g., 90% for propylene) while mitigating coke formation. However, further research is needed to:

1. Optimize SAA compositions for different reactions
2. Improve long-term stability under industrial conditions
3. Develop scalable synthesis methods for SAAs
4. Understand the fundamental mechanisms of coke resistance in SAAs

我们对铂基催化剂积碳沉积的理解已经发展到认识到这是一个降低催化活性和选择性的主要挑战。主要挑战是在保持高催化性能的同时防止碳积累。

解决这些挑战的策略包括：

1. 开发单原子合金（SAAs）：铂/铜SAAs表现出优异的CO耐受性和选择性CH活化，同时防止积碳。它们表现出中等的CH活化障碍，使其保持活性但避免碳积累。

2. 促进脱附：铂/铜SAAs可以促进表面结合中间体（如丙烯）的脱附，防止进一步脱氢导致积碳形成。

3. 调节电子结构：通过将铂与铜等其他金属合金化，修改电子结构以平衡反应性和抗积碳性。

这些策略在保持高选择性（例如，丙烯的90%）的同时减轻积碳形成方面表现出效果。然而，还需要进一步研究：

1. 优化不同反应的SAA组成
2. 提高工业条件下的长期稳定性
3. 开发SAAs的可扩展合成方法
4. 了解SAAs中抗积碳的基本机制
