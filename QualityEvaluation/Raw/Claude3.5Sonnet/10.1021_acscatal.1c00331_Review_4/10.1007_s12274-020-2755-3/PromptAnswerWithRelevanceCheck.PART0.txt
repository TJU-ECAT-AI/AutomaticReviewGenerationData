</quotes>

<EnglishVersionAnswer>

The literature provides limited information specifically about coke deposition in Pt-based catalysts, but it does mention some strategies to address related challenges:

1. The use of single atom alloys (SAAs), particularly Pt/Cu SAAs, has shown promise in addressing coking issues. These catalysts exhibit excellent CO tolerance in H2 activation.

2. Compared to Pt nanoparticles, Pt/Cu SAAs demonstrate intermediate barriers for C-H activation. This allows them to remain catalytically active while preventing coking.

3. Pt/Cu SAAs can promote the desorption of surface-bonded hydrocarbons (like propylene) and inhibit further dehydrogenation. This results in high selectivity (around 90%) for desired products.

These strategies address some challenges associated with coke deposition by modifying the electronic and geometric properties of Pt catalysts through alloying with Cu at the atomic level. However, the literature does not provide comprehensive information on prevention methods, novel catalyst designs, regeneration techniques, or remaining obstacles in this field. Further research would be needed to fully address the question's scope.

文献对Pt基催化剂中焦炭沉积的信息有限，但确实提到了一些解决相关挑战的策略：

1. 单原子合金(SAAs)，特别是Pt/Cu SAAs的使用在解决结焦问题方面显示出了前景。这些催化剂在H2活化中表现出优异的CO耐受性。

2. 与Pt纳米颗粒相比，Pt/Cu SAAs表现出中等的C-H键活化能垒。这使它们保持催化活性的同时防止结焦。

3. Pt/Cu SAAs可以促进表面结合烃类(如丙烯)的脱附，并抑制进一步脱氢。这导致了所需产物的高选择性(约90%)。

这些策略通过在原子水平上将Pt与Cu合金化来修改Pt催化剂的电子和几何性质，从而解决了一些与焦炭沉积相关的挑战。然而，文献并未提供关于预防方法、新型催化剂设计、再生技术或该领域剩余障碍的全面信息。需要进一步的研究才能全面解答问题的范围。

Our understanding of coke deposition in Pt-based catalysts has evolved to recognize it as a significant challenge that can deactivate catalysts. The primary challenge is preventing coking while maintaining catalytic activity. One strategy to address this is using single atom alloys (SAAs), such as Pt/Cu SAAs. These exhibit intermediate barriers for C-H activation, which allows them to remain catalytically active while resisting coke formation. This approach shows promise, but further research is needed to fully optimize SAA designs for different reactions and to understand the long-term stability and regeneration possibilities of these catalysts.

The understanding of coke deposition in Pt-based catalysts has evolved to recognize it as a significant challenge that can deactivate catalysts. The primary challenge is balancing catalytic activity with coke resistance. 

Strategies to address this include:

1. Novel catalyst designs: Pt/Cu single atom alloys (SAAs) have been developed to maintain activity while preventing coking. These SAAs exhibit intermediate barriers for C-H activation, allowing them to remain active but resist coke formation.

2. Promoting desorption: Pt/Cu SAAs can promote the desorption of surface-bonded hydrocarbons like propylene, preventing further dehydrogenation that leads to coke.

3. Tuning selectivity: By modifying the electronic structure of Pt atoms through alloying, high selectivity (around 90%) for desired products like propylene can be achieved, reducing unwanted side reactions that form coke.

These strategies have shown effectiveness in lab-scale studies. However, challenges remain in scaling up production of precisely structured SAAs, understanding long-term stability under industrial conditions, and developing regeneration techniques specific to these novel catalyst designs. Further research is needed to address these obstacles and fully realize the potential of SAA catalysts in preventing coke deposition while maintaining high activity.

对Pt基催化剂中积炭沉积的认识已经演变为将其视为可使催化剂失活的重大挑战。主要挑战是平衡催化活性与抗积炭性能。

解决这一问题的策略包括：

1. 新型催化剂设计：开发了Pt/Cu单原子合金(SAAs)以保持活性同时防止积炭。这些SAAs表现出C-H活化的中等能垒，使其保持活性但能抵抗积炭形成。

2. 促进脱附：Pt/Cu SAAs可以促进表面结合烃类(如丙烯)的脱附，防止进一步脱氢导致积炭。

3. 调节选择性：通过合金化修改Pt原子的电子结构，可以实现对所需产物(如丙烯)的高选择性(约90%)，减少导致积炭的不良副反应。

这些策略在实验室规模的研究中已显示出效果。然而，在精确结构SAAs的规模化生产、了解工业条件下的长期稳定性以及开发针对这些新型催化剂设计的再生技术方面仍存在挑战。需要进一步研究以解决这些障碍，充分实现SAA催化剂在防止积炭沉积的同时保持高活性的潜力。

The literature does not provide comprehensive information to fully answer the question about coke deposition in Pt-based catalysts. However, it does offer some insights into strategies for addressing catalytic challenges using single-atom catalysts (SACs).

The development of Pt/Cu single atom alloys has shown promise in preventing coking while maintaining catalytic activity. These alloys exhibit intermediate barriers for C-H activation, which allows them to remain active while avoiding coke formation. This suggests that alloying Pt with other metals at the atomic level can be an effective strategy for mitigating coking issues.

Strong metal-support interactions have also been explored as a way to enhance catalytic performance. For example, Pt single atoms anchored on Co3O4 through electronic metal-support interactions have shown improved activity for certain reactions. Similarly, single Pt atoms on defective TiO2 supports with organized Pt-O-Ti3+ coordination demonstrated exceptional photocatalytic hydrogen evolution rates.

These approaches highlight the importance of tailoring the local coordination environment of Pt atoms to optimize catalytic performance and potentially address challenges like coke deposition. However, the literature does not provide specific information on coke deposition prevention methods, regeneration techniques, or a comprehensive evaluation of the effectiveness of these strategies in addressing coking issues.

Further research is needed to fully understand the mechanisms of coke formation on Pt-based catalysts and to develop more targeted approaches for preventing and mitigating this phenomenon across a broader range of catalytic applications.

该文献并未提供足够的信息来全面回答关于Pt基催化剂积炭的问题。然而，它确实提供了一些关于使用单原子催化剂(SACs)解决催化挑战的策略的见解。

Pt/Cu单原子合金的开发显示出防止积炭同时保持催化活性的前景。这些合金对C-H活化表现出中等程度的能垒，使它们能够保持活性同时避免积炭形成。这表明在原子水平上将Pt与其他金属合金化可能是缓解积炭问题的有效策略。

强金属-载体相互作用也被探索用于提高催化性能。例如，通过电子金属-载体相互作用固定在Co3O4上的Pt单原子对某些反应表现出更好的活性。同样，在具有组织化Pt-O-Ti3+配位的缺陷TiO2载体上的单个Pt原子也表现出异常高的光催化产氢速率。

这些方法强调了调整Pt原子局部配位环境以优化催化性能并可能解决积炭等挑战的重要性。然而，该文献并未提供关于积炭防止方法、再生技术的具体信息，也没有对这些策略在解决积炭问题方面的有效性进行全面评估。

需要进一步的研究来充分理解Pt基催化剂上积炭形成的机制，并开发更有针对性的方法来防止和缓解这种现象在更广泛的催化应用中的发生。

Our understanding of coke deposition in Pt-based catalysts has evolved to recognize it as a major challenge that reduces catalytic activity and selectivity. The primary challenges are preventing carbon accumulation while maintaining high catalytic performance.

Strategies to address these challenges include:

1. Developing single-atom alloys (SAAs): Pt/Cu SAAs have shown excellent CO tolerance and selective CH activation while preventing coking. They exhibit intermediate barriers for CH activation, allowing them to remain active but avoid carbon buildup.

2. Promoting desorption: Pt/Cu SAAs can promote the desorption of surface-bonded intermediates like propylene, preventing further dehydrogenation that leads to coke formation.

3. Tuning electronic structure: By alloying Pt with other metals like Cu, the electronic structure is modified to balance reactivity and resistance to coking.

These strategies have shown effectiveness in maintaining high selectivity (e.g., 90% for propylene) while mitigating coke formation. However, further research is needed to:

1. Optimize SAA compositions for different reactions
2. Improve long-term stability under industrial conditions
3. Develop scalable synthesis methods for SAAs
4. Understand the fundamental mechanisms of coke resistance in SAAs
