The understanding of coke deposition in Pt-based catalysts has evolved to recognize it as a significant challenge that can deactivate catalysts. The primary challenge is balancing catalytic activity with coke resistance. 

Strategies to address this include:

1. Novel catalyst designs: Pt/Cu single atom alloys (SAAs) have been developed to maintain activity while preventing coking. These SAAs exhibit intermediate barriers for C-H activation, allowing them to remain active but resist coke formation.

2. Promoting desorption: Pt/Cu SAAs can promote the desorption of surface-bonded hydrocarbons like propylene, preventing further dehydrogenation that leads to coke.

3. Tuning selectivity: By modifying the electronic structure of Pt atoms through alloying, high selectivity (around 90%) for desired products like propylene can be achieved, reducing unwanted side reactions that form coke.

These strategies have shown effectiveness in lab-scale studies. However, challenges remain in scaling up production of precisely structured SAAs, understanding long-term stability under industrial conditions, and developing regeneration techniques specific to these novel catalyst designs. Further research is needed to address these obstacles and fully realize the potential of SAA catalysts in preventing coke deposition while maintaining high activity.

对Pt基催化剂中积炭沉积的认识已经演变为将其视为可使催化剂失活的重大挑战。主要挑战是平衡催化活性与抗积炭性能。

解决这一问题的策略包括：

1. 新型催化剂设计：开发了Pt/Cu单原子合金(SAAs)以保持活性同时防止积炭。这些SAAs表现出C-H活化的中等能垒，使其保持活性但能抵抗积炭形成。

2. 促进脱附：Pt/Cu SAAs可以促进表面结合烃类(如丙烯)的脱附，防止进一步脱氢导致积炭。

3. 调节选择性：通过合金化修改Pt原子的电子结构，可以实现对所需产物(如丙烯)的高选择性(约90%)，减少导致积炭的不良副反应。

这些策略在实验室规模的研究中已显示出效果。然而，在精确结构SAAs的规模化生产、了解工业条件下的长期稳定性以及开发针对这些新型催化剂设计的再生技术方面仍存在挑战。需要进一步研究以解决这些障碍，充分实现SAA催化剂在防止积炭沉积的同时保持高活性的潜力。
