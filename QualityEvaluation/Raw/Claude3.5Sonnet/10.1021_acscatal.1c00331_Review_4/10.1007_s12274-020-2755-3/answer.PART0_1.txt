Our understanding of coke deposition in Pt-based catalysts has evolved to recognize it as a significant challenge that can deactivate catalysts. The primary challenge is preventing coking while maintaining catalytic activity. One strategy to address this is using single atom alloys (SAAs), such as Pt/Cu SAAs. These exhibit intermediate barriers for C-H activation, which allows them to remain catalytically active while resisting coke formation. This approach shows promise, but further research is needed to fully optimize SAA designs for different reactions and to understand the long-term stability and regeneration possibilities of these catalysts.

我们对铂基催化剂中焦炭沉积的理解已经演变为认识到这是一个可能使催化剂失活的重大挑战。主要挑战是在保持催化活性的同时防止结焦。解决这一问题的一种策略是使用单原子合金(SAAs)，如Pt/Cu SAAs。这些合金表现出C-H活化的中等能垒，使它们能够保持催化活性同时抵抗焦炭形成。这种方法显示了前景，但还需要进一步研究以充分优化不同反应的SAA设计，并了解这些催化剂的长期稳定性和再生可能性。
