[1] "Sykes et al., Pt SA/Cu SAAs with an atomic ratio of Pt:Cu = 1:1.25 exhibited excellent CO tolerance in H2 activation"

[2] "Compared to Pt nanoparticles, the Pt/Cu single atom alloys exhibited intermediate barriers for CH activation, which kept active but prevented from coking."

The literature provides limited information specifically about coke deposition in Pt-based catalysts, but it does mention some strategies to address related challenges:

1. The use of single atom alloys (SAAs), particularly Pt/Cu SAAs, has shown promise in addressing coking issues. These catalysts exhibit excellent CO tolerance in H2 activation.

2. Compared to Pt nanoparticles, Pt/Cu SAAs demonstrate intermediate barriers for C-H activation. This allows them to remain catalytically active while preventing coking.

3. Pt/Cu SAAs can promote the desorption of surface-bonded hydrocarbons (like propylene) and inhibit further dehydrogenation. This results in high selectivity (around 90%) for desired products.

These strategies address some challenges associated with coke deposition by modifying the electronic and geometric properties of Pt catalysts through alloying with Cu at the atomic level. However, the literature does not provide comprehensive information on prevention methods, novel catalyst designs, regeneration techniques, or remaining obstacles in this field. Further research would be needed to fully address the question's scope.

文献对Pt基催化剂中焦炭沉积的信息有限，但确实提到了一些解决相关挑战的策略：

1. 单原子合金(SAAs)，特别是Pt/Cu SAAs的使用在解决结焦问题方面显示出了前景。这些催化剂在H2活化中表现出优异的CO耐受性。

2. 与Pt纳米颗粒相比，Pt/Cu SAAs表现出中等的C-H键活化能垒。这使它们保持催化活性的同时防止结焦。

3. Pt/Cu SAAs可以促进表面结合烃类(如丙烯)的脱附，并抑制进一步脱氢。这导致了所需产物的高选择性(约90%)。

这些策略通过在原子水平上将Pt与Cu合金化来修改Pt催化剂的电子和几何性质，从而解决了一些与焦炭沉积相关的挑战。然而，文献并未提供关于预防方法、新型催化剂设计、再生技术或该领域剩余障碍的全面信息。需要进一步的研究才能全面解答问题的范围。
