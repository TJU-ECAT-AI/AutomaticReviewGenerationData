[1] "Sykes et al., they prepared Pt/Cu single atom alloys which exhibited efficient and highly selective CH activation catalytic property [20]. Compared to Pt nanoparticles, the Pt/Cu single atom alloys exhibited intermediate barriers for CH activation, which kept active but prevented from coking."

The literature does not provide comprehensive information to fully answer the question about coke deposition in Pt-based catalysts. However, it does offer some insights into strategies for addressing catalytic challenges using single-atom catalysts (SACs).

The development of Pt/Cu single atom alloys has shown promise in preventing coking while maintaining catalytic activity. These alloys exhibit intermediate barriers for C-H activation, which allows them to remain active while avoiding coke formation. This suggests that alloying Pt with other metals at the atomic level can be an effective strategy for mitigating coking issues.

Strong metal-support interactions have also been explored as a way to enhance catalytic performance. For example, Pt single atoms anchored on Co3O4 through electronic metal-support interactions have shown improved activity for certain reactions. Similarly, single Pt atoms on defective TiO2 supports with organized Pt-O-Ti3+ coordination demonstrated exceptional photocatalytic hydrogen evolution rates.

These approaches highlight the importance of tailoring the local coordination environment of Pt atoms to optimize catalytic performance and potentially address challenges like coke deposition. However, the literature does not provide specific information on coke deposition prevention methods, regeneration techniques, or a comprehensive evaluation of the effectiveness of these strategies in addressing coking issues.

Further research is needed to fully understand the mechanisms of coke formation on Pt-based catalysts and to develop more targeted approaches for preventing and mitigating this phenomenon across a broader range of catalytic applications.

该文献并未提供足够的信息来全面回答关于Pt基催化剂积炭的问题。然而，它确实提供了一些关于使用单原子催化剂(SACs)解决催化挑战的策略的见解。

Pt/Cu单原子合金的开发显示出防止积炭同时保持催化活性的前景。这些合金对C-H活化表现出中等程度的能垒，使它们能够保持活性同时避免积炭形成。这表明在原子水平上将Pt与其他金属合金化可能是缓解积炭问题的有效策略。

强金属-载体相互作用也被探索用于提高催化性能。例如，通过电子金属-载体相互作用固定在Co3O4上的Pt单原子对某些反应表现出更好的活性。同样，在具有组织化Pt-O-Ti3+配位的缺陷TiO2载体上的单个Pt原子也表现出异常高的光催化产氢速率。

这些方法强调了调整Pt原子局部配位环境以优化催化性能并可能解决积炭等挑战的重要性。然而，该文献并未提供关于积炭防止方法、再生技术的具体信息，也没有对这些策略在解决积炭问题方面的有效性进行全面评估。

需要进一步的研究来充分理解Pt基催化剂上积炭形成的机制，并开发更有针对性的方法来防止和缓解这种现象在更广泛的催化应用中的发生。
