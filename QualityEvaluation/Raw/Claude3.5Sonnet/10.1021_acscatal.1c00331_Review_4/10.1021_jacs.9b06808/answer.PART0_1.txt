This document does not contain any information about coke deposition in Pt-based catalysts, challenges associated with it, or strategies to address these challenges. The title and limited content provided focus on constructing high-loading single-atom/cluster catalysts via an electrochemical potential window strategy, which is unrelated to the question asked. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer based on this literature.

该文件不包含任何关于Pt基催化剂中焦炭沉积、相关挑战或解决这些挑战的策略的信息。文献标题和提供的有限内容集中于通过电化学电位窗口策略构建高负载单原子/簇催化剂，这与所问问题无关。因此，我无法根据这篇文献提供答案。
