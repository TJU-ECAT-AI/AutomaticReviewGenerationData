Coke deposition is a significant challenge in Pt-based catalysts, impacting their performance and longevity in various industrial processes. This phenomenon occurs when carbon-rich deposits accumulate on the catalyst surface, blocking active sites and reducing catalytic efficiency. Understanding the mechanisms behind coke formation is crucial for developing effective mitigation strategies. Researchers are investigating factors such as temperature, pressure, and feedstock composition that contribute to coking. Advanced characterization techniques, including in-situ spectroscopy and microscopy, are being employed to observe coke formation in real-time. Armed with this knowledge, scientists are exploring innovative approaches to enhance catalyst resistance to coking, such as modifying catalyst supports, incorporating promoters, and optimizing reaction conditions. Additionally, novel catalyst designs are being developed, focusing on nanostructured materials and bimetallic formulations that exhibit improved coke resistance. These advancements in understanding and mitigating coke deposition are paving the way for more efficient and durable Pt-based catalysts, ultimately benefiting industries ranging from petroleum refining to fuel cell technology.
