Abstract
Conspectus
Epitaxial growth is a promising strategy to produce high-quality graphene samples. At the same time, this method has great flexibility for industrial scale-up. To optimize growth protocols, it is essential to understand the underlying growth mechanisms. This is, however, very challenging, as the growth process is complicated and involves many elementary steps. Experimentally, atomic-scale in situ characterization methods are generally not feasible at the high temperature of graphene growth. Therefore, kinetics is the main experimental information to study growth mechanisms. Theoretically, first-principles calculations routinely provide atomic structures and energetics but have a stringent limit on the accessible spatial and time scales. Such gap between experiment and theory can be bridged by atomistic simulations using first-principles atomic details as input and providing the overall growth kinetics, which can be directly compared with experiment, as output. Typically, system-specific approximations should be applied to make such simulations computationally feasible.
By feeding kinetic Monte Carlo (kMC) simulations with first-principles parameters, we can directly simulate the graphene growth process and thus understand the growth mechanisms. Our simulations suggest that the carbon dimer is the dominant feeding species in the epitaxial growth of graphene on both Cu(111) and Cu(100) surfaces, which enables us to understand why the reaction is diffusion limited on Cu(111) but attachment limited on Cu(100). When hydrogen is explicitly considered in the simulation, the central role hydrogen plays in graphene growth is revealed, which solves the long-standing puzzle into why H2 should be fed in the chemical vapor deposition of graphene.
The simulation results can be directly compared with the experimental kinetic data, if available. Our kMC simulations reproduce the experimentally observed quintic-like behavior of graphene growth on Ir(111). By checking the simulation results, we find that such nonlinearity is caused by lattice mismatch, and the induced growth front inhomogeneity can be universally used to predict growth behaviors in other heteroepitaxial systems. Notably, although experimental kinetics usually gives useful insight into atomic mechanisms, it can sometimes be misleading. Such pitfalls can be avoided via atomistic simulations, as demonstrated in our study of the graphene etching process.
Growth protocols can be designed theoretically with computational kinetic and mechanistic information. By contrasting the different activation energies involved in an atom-exchange-based carbon penetration process for monolayer and bilayer graphene, we propose a three-step strategy to grow high-quality bilayer graphene. Based on first-principles parameters, a kinetic pathway toward the high-density, ordered N doping of epitaxial graphene on Cu(111) using a C5NCl5 precursor is also identified.
These studies demonstrate that atomistic simulations can unambiguously produce or reproduce the kinetic information on graphene growth, which is pivotal to understanding the growth mechanism and designing better growth protocols. A similar strategy can be used in growth mechanism studies of other two-dimensional atomic crystals.

1. Introduction
Graphene is an important material that has attracted intense research interest from both academia and industry. (1,2) Among the available methods for its synthesis, epitaxial growth is promising for the realization of both high quality and large quantity of the obtained graphene samples. (3,4) By using different metal substrates, (3,57) carbon sources, (8) and growth environments (temperature, pressure, etc.), (9) different groups have developed very different protocols to grow graphene, which has led to diverse growth behaviors and sample morphologies. (10,11) Guided optimization of the growth conditions requires a deep understanding of the growth mechanisms. Unfortunately, characterization of the atomic details of graphene growth in situ and in operando is still a great challenge, mainly due to the high growth temperature. Kinetic information is thus the main experimental clue to conjecture growth mechanisms.
First-principles, semiempirical, and empirical theoretical methods are routinely used in geometry optimizations and energy calculations to compare the relative stabilities of different species on a metal surface. Such results of atomistic resolution certainly provide useful insight for understanding the growth mechanism. (1218) However, the energetics, in principle, is an equilibrium state property and is difficult to be directly related to the overall kinetics obtained from experiment. To fill this gap between theory and experiment, explicit simulations of graphene growth are desirable. Due to the complexity, multiscale simulation techniques, from molecular dynamics (MD) (19) to kinetic Monte Carlo (kMC), (2022) rate equations, (21,23) kinetic Wulff construction, (24,25) phase field, (26) and even computational fluid dynamics (CFD), (27) have been used to study graphene growth. To gain enough mechanistic insight, maintaining atomistic resolution in the simulation is desirable.
In this Account, we summarize our recent progress in the atomistic simulation of graphene growth. Based on our simulation results, we can now largely understand the mechanism of graphene growth on different substrates, even for the most complicated and most widely adopted case of chemical vapor deposition (CVD) on a Cu substrate. A direct comparison between the simulation results and experimental data provides an ultimate way to judge mechanistic hypotheses gained from experiment. With kinetic and mechanistic information from simulations, we can also theoretically design growth protocols to tune graphene growth. These results demonstrate that atomistic simulation plays an important role in understanding two-dimensional (2D) van der Waals (vdW) epitaxy.
2. Simulation Techniques
The most straightforward atomistic simulation technique is MD. In a classical MD simulation, the atoms move following Newtons law. To discretize Newtons equation with a desirable accuracy, the proper time step is about 1 fs. Therefore, the time scale accessible for an MD simulation is typically much shorter than that of graphene growth, which makes MD more suitable for studying specific problems in graphene growth instead of obtaining an overall picture. High temperature and/or high oversaturation may be required in MD simulations to artificially speed up the growth. Alternatively, MD simulations can be used with enhanced sampling techniques, such as metadynamics (28) and umbrella sampling, (29) to obtain the potential of mean force and kinetic information on key reactions.
To go beyond MD, a time scale coarse grain technique such as kMC can be adopted. In a typical kMC simulation, the whole system is represented by a lattice, where different sites can be occupied by different species. The occupation status of all sites determines the configuration of the system. At each step, all events that can change the current system configuration are listed in a table along with their rates, which are typically provided by first-principles calculations within the framework of transition state theory. A specific event is selected with a probability proportional to its rate, which changes the lattice configuration and advances the simulation. However, even with kMC, an explicit simulation of graphene growth may still be computationally unfeasible. Therefore, we developed some system-specific techniques to speed up kMC simulations of graphene growth.
2.1. Floating Simulation Box
To obtain a statistically significant growth rate, the graphene edge as the growth front must be propagated forward over a long distance, which requires a very large simulation cell. To solve this problem, we divided the whole system into four regions (Figure 1): graphene area, where graphene is already formed (black dashed box); far field, in which a stationary distribution of different surface species can be assumed (blue dashed box); diffusion layer, through which a carbon flux passes (yellow dashed box); growth front, whose velocity determines the growth rate (red dashed box). If we focus on the last region and use a simulation box moving with the growth front, the so-called standing-on-the-growth-front (SOF) model permits us to use a very small simulation box but still obtain a statistically significant growth rate. (20)

2.2. Time Scale Separation
If there is a large rate gap in the event list, the possibility to select low-rate events, which will determine the overall growth kinetics, becomes extremely low. Most of the simulation time will be wasted on fast events and the system is trapped in local equilibrium states. In this situation, a time scale separation technique can be used. (20) If slow events have not been selected for a long time, then the fast events can be temporarily removed from the event list. After a slow event is selected, the full event list is restored.
2.3. Mean Field Approximation for Specific Species
A species that diffuses quickly can reach its equilibrium distribution quickly for any configuration of other species. In an explicit kMC simulation, the diffusion of this species, if abundant, will have a very high probability to be selected and thus consumes a large amount of simulation time. To avoid this situation, we can apply a mean field approximation for this species, (22) where its lattice distribution is not bookkept and only its total number is recorded. Fast diffusion events for this species are permanently removed from the event list, and the rates of all other events involving this species are adjusted according to its total number.
3. Identification of Dominant Kinetic Pathways
Because it can explicitly simulate the graphene growth process, atomistic modeling provides an independent means to investigate growth mechanisms. For example, dominant kinetic pathways of growth can be identified without any input from experiment.
3.1. Hydrogen-Free Growth on a Cu Substrate
Graphene growth on Cu(111) has been found experimentally to be diffusion limited. (30) Because the diffusion of carbon atoms on Cu(111) is almost barrierless, this is a surprising observation if graphene growth occurs through the attachment of carbon atoms to graphene edges. One possibility is that carbon atom attachment is not the dominant kinetic pathway of graphene growth. We performed an atomistic simulation study to find the actual feeding species for graphene growth. (21)
First, we calculated the energy barriers of all possible events on the surface involving carbon species up to trimers from first principles. As expected, monomer attachment to the graphene edges has a high barrier (1.17 eV), which blocks the pathway of graphene growth via carbon monomer attachment. The dimer is energetically much more favorable than the monomer on Cu(111), (12) and the formation of a dimer from two monomers is kinetically feasible with a low barrier (0.3 eV). Further increasing the cluster size to form a trimer has a large barrier (1.15 eV). Therefore, many dimers will be formed on the surface. By solving the rate equations, we found that the steady-state concentration of dimer is indeed at least 2 orders of magnitude higher than that of other species. Although the barrier to dimer diffusion (0.49 eV) is still slightly lower than that to attachment at the graphene edge (0.58 eV), the low concentrations of carbon species and graphene islands on the surface may make graphene growth diffusion limited.
To determine whether dimer attachment is the dominant growth pathway and whether this pathway will lead to diffusion-limited growth behavior, kMC simulations were performed. First, the dominance of the dimer predicted by the rate-equation approach within the mean field approximation was confirmed. More importantly, a carbon concentration gradient around the graphene islands, which is characteristic of diffusion-limited growth, was observed (Figure 2a). We also used kMC simulations to perform virtual experiments by, for example, artificially increasing the dimer attachment barrier. In this case, the carbon concentration gradient disappears (Figure 2b). This result confirms that the experimentally observed diffusion-limited growth behavior is indeed a result of the dimer being the dominant feeding species of graphene growth on Cu(111).

Similar simulations can be performed for graphene growth on Cu(100). In this case, the dimer is also the dominant feeding species, but the growth behavior becomes attachment limited. This conclusion is consistent with experimental observations. (31) Identification of the dimer as the dominant feeding species can also be used to explain the experimentally observed graphene island morphology transformation at different temperatures. (30) Generally, the formation of dendritic or compact islands is determined by the competition between carbon attachment and its diffusion along the edge. Based on such a model, we can estimate the transition temperatures, which reasonably agree with experiment. (21)
3.2. Hydrogen-Involved Growth on a Cu Substrate
Hydrogen is highly involved in the industry-compatible CVD growth of graphene, where hydrocarbon molecules, such as methane, are used as the carbon source. Our density functional theory (DFT) calculations indicate that the dehydrogenation of methane and other intermediate species is coupled with other elementary steps of graphene growth. (32) Therefore, all CxHy species should be considered in H-involved CVD growth on Cu substrates.
What makes things more complicated is that, in most CVD experiments, H2 gas is also provided. Because the overall reaction of graphene CVD growth with methane is CH4  C + 2H2, it is counterintuitive as to why H2, which is a byproduct of the reaction, should be supplied. Both hydrogen-promoted growth (33,34) and hydrogen-induced graphene etching (35,36) have been observed experimentally, but the underlying mechanism is still under debate. (37) Hydrogen can affect the surface species concentration, graphene edge configuration, and carbon attachment/detachment dynamics. Relevant elementary processes form a complicated kinetic network. To understand the mechanisms behind this network, the dominant kinetic pathways should be unambiguously identified. (22)
DFT calculations indicate that H2 can easily dissociate into H adatoms on Cu(111). In contrast, the dehydrogenation of CH4 is endothermic with a high activation barrier, making the surface sticking coefficient of CH4 extremely low. As a result, the surface concentration of H atoms is typically much higher than those of carbon-containing species, even if the partial pressure of H2 is lower than that of CH4. Our kMC simulations indicate that the surface H atom concentration is almost exclusively determined by the H2 partial pressure. At low H2 pressures, the most abundant carbon-containing species is C2, and CH becomes dominant at high H2 pressure. The graphene edge configuration also depends on the H2 partial pressure. Between metal passivation at low H2 pressures (16) and hydrogen saturation at high H2 pressures, (38) homogeneous partially hydrogen-saturated configurations exist due to entropic effects.
The attachment of different carbon-containing species to the graphene edge is generally easier at metal-passivated sites than at hydrogen-saturated sites. The same trend also stands for carbon detachment. An overall picture of growth can be obtained via kMC simulations. As shown in Figure 3, under a relatively low H2 pressure, CH and C2 are the most commonly attached species. Although the raw attachment frequencies of these two species are comparable, the contribution to graphene growth from C2 is much higher. The reason is that the C2 detachment barrier at metal-passivated edge sites (2.19 eV) is much higher than the CH detachment barrier (1.08 eV). Because the concentration of carbon-containing species in graphene CVD growth is extremely low (<105 ML), a high detachment barrier is critical for a species to be stable at the graphene edge. Otherwise, it will easily detach from the edge and not stay until the next carbon-containing species arrives. Because detachment from H-saturated edges is generally much slower than from metal-passivated edges, hydrogen saturation stabilizes the graphene edges during growth. At the same time, hydrogen also reacts with carbon-containing species on the surface, which finally leads to desorption of these species. The competition between these two mechanisms can describe many experimentally observed hydrogen effects in graphene growth, such as the change in growth rate with H2 partial pressure. (34)

4. Reproducing Experimental Kinetics
The ability of atomistic simulations to be used as an independent tool to study the kinetics of graphene growth makes it possible to directly compare simulation results with experimental kinetic data, when available.
4.1. Nonlinear Growth on an Ir Substrate
Experimental kinetic data have been obtained for graphene growth on Ru(0001) (39) and Ir(111) (40) surfaces via low-energy electron microscopy (LEEM). The growth rate was described by a nonlinear quintic-like function of the surface carbon concentration. Such kinetic information provides valuable insight into the growth mechanism, indicating that the growth rate is somehow determined by the attachment of five-membered carbon clusters. Unfortunately, further atomic details are not available. (41)
Using the Ir(111) surface as an example, we systematically studied such interesting growth behavior. (20) First, the energetics of all possible carbon clusters on the surface were determined by DFT calculations to obtain a stationary distribution of different clusters in the far field. The concentration of carbon monomers determines the concentration of larger clusters via the chemical equilibrium Cn  nC. Then, diffusion barriers were calculated for these clusters, which determines their mobility and the strength of the carbon flux from the far field to the growth front (Figure 1). Large clusters, such as C5, have similar or even higher mobility than small clusters, but their concentrations are more than 10 orders of magnitude lower.
DFT calculations on carbon cluster attachment at the graphene edge indicate that small cluster attachment can be either endothermic or exothermic depending on the attaching edge site. Due to lattice mismatch, a Moir pattern forms for graphene grown on Ir(111), and each edge site has a different chemical environment. Taking carbon monomer as an example, if the attached carbon sits on top of a substrate Ir atom, the attachment is endothermic. When the attached carbon atom is located in a surface hollow site, the corresponding monomer attachment becomes exothermic. Because carbon monomer is present on Ir(111) in a much higher concentration than the other clusters, there is a large monomer flux to the graphene edges, and carbon atoms will attach to all sites with exothermic monomer attachment (Figure 4a). For other sites to which attachment is endothermic, attached carbon monomers will soon detach. If a large cluster such as C5 is available, the gap can be filled by an exothermic cluster attachment event (Figure 4b). Because large clusters have extremely low concentrations, their attachment is rare, which eventually determines the overall growth rate.

To obtain quantitative results, we performed SOF-kMC simulations using the time scale separation technique. By repeating simulations at different carbon concentrations, we finally obtained a relation between the growth rate and carbon monomer concentration, which was well fit by a curve with an exponent of 5.25 (Figure 4c). Such good agreement between simulation and experiment gives us high confidence in the revealed mechanism, as everything in our simulations comes from first principles without fitting to experiment. Virtual experiments with artificial kMC parameters indicate that nonlinear growth induced by lattice mismatch is a universal mechanism, (42) which explains why similar kinetics have been observed in experiments for substrates with contrasting interactions with carbon.
4.2. Ni Nanoparticle-Catalyzed Graphene Cutting
Although it helps describe the mechanism in most cases, experimental kinetic information can sometimes be misleading. An interesting example is metal nanoparticle-catalyzed graphene cutting in H2 atmosphere, (4345) which is the reverse process of graphene growth and is also a useful tool for device fabrication after graphene growth, as the cutting is usually along a specific direction, in most cases the zigzag direction. (46) The gasification rate of carbon atoms has been experimentally found to be proportional to the nanoparticle surface area. (47) Based on this experimental kinetic information, we may expect that the rate-limiting step involves the surface of the metal nanoparticles. However, all possible surface reactions, such as hydrogen dissociation and carbon hydrogenation, seem no more difficult than CC bond breaking at the nanoparticle-graphene interface. If CC bond breaking is the most difficult step, the cutting rate is expected to be linearly dependent on the nanoparticle radius.
To solve this puzzle, we performed multiscale simulations of Ni nanoparticle-catalyzed graphene cutting. (48) Reactive MD simulations using the ReaxFF force field (49) at an elevated temperature indicate that at least two Ni atoms are required to break the CC bond, and intimate contact between the metal nanoparticle and graphene edge is critical. This explains why the more open and flexible armchair edge is easier to etch than the zigzag edge. With knowledge from our MD simulations, we can go beyond previous single metal atom (50) or metal surface (51,52) approximations and construct a minimal but still realistic model for a DFT-level investigation of graphene cutting, where four and six Ni atoms are used to represent the nanoparticle for zigzag and armchair edge site cutting, respectively. DFT calculations predict a higher cutting barrier for zigzag CC bonds than for armchair bonds and confirm that the ReaxFF force field is reliable for this system.
Using the reliable force field, metadynamics simulations at the experimental temperature were performed to obtain the free energy profile. The free energy barrier to breaking a zigzag CC bond is 1.73 eV. For armchair CC bond breaking, using the coordination number of the two outmost carbon atoms as reaction coordinates, we obtain a complicated free energy surface (Figure 5a). The most favorable reaction pathway is marked with green arrows in Figure 5b. The corresponding free energy barrier is 1.11 eV, which is much lower than the zigzag case.

Our kMC simulations based on kinetic parameters from metadynamics successfully reproduce the surface area dependence of the cutting rate k. Because the zigzag site is difficult to etch, most of the cutting time is spent on waiting for the first zigzag CC bond to be cut after a new zigzag edge is formed. Then, kink sites, which are even more open and flexible than pristine armchair sites, are formed. By etching these kink sites, a whole zigzag row can be quickly etched, and a new zigzag edge is formed. In such a triggering mechanism, the etching time t for a specific cutting distance is determined by the wait time for etching of the first zigzag site, which is inversely proportional to the nanoparticle radius R, because the larger the nanoparticle, the longer the graphene-metal interface, and thus, more sites have potential to be the first zigzag site. At the same time, the number of etched carbon atoms N for a specific cutting distance is proportional to R, as the cutting channel is wider for larger nanoparticles. Finally, the etching rate k = N/t  R2. Therefore, the R2 dependence is not derived from a rate-limiting surface reaction. Atomistic simulations enable us to understand such interface-reaction limited cutting processes with the surface area-dependent kinetics.
5. Mechanistic Study Based Growth Protocol Design
With a deep understanding of the growth mechanisms, we can theoretically design optimal growth protocols for a specific purpose, such as bilayer graphene growth or heteroatom-doped graphene growth.
5.1. Bilayer Graphene Growth
Because it does not have a finite gap, graphene cannot be used in digital devices requiring a high onoff ratio. Bilayer graphene is suitable for this purpose, as a band gap can be easily induced by an electric field. However, graphene growth on a Cu surface is traditionally considered to be a self-limiting process leading to graphene monolayers. The main reason for this behavior is that if a graphene overlayer is formed, it will cover the Cu surface and block carbon-containing species from reaching the substrate.
Our mechanistic study suggests that carbon atoms can actually penetrate a graphene overlayer on a Cu surface by atom exchange. (53) At the same time, the barrier to penetrate the second graphene layer becomes much higher, which provides a possible method to controllably grow bilayer graphene. We propose the multistep protocol shown in Figure 6, which can be described as follows: (a) monolayer graphene is grown via the standard CVD method on a Cu surface, (b) penetration-based carbon monomer intercalation leads to the growth of a second layer using molecular-beam epitaxy (MBE), (c) hydrogen gas is supplied to etch extra carbon species, and (d) high-quality bilayer graphene is finally obtained after hydrocarbon desorption. According to our calculations, the optimal temperature of the MBE step is 693 K.

(d) After hydrocarbon desorption, high-quality bilayer graphene is obtained. Adapted from ref (53). Copyright 2014 American Chemical Society.
5.2. N-Doped Graphene Growth
Doping is an effective strategy to increase the carrier density in graphene. However, the realization of uniform doping and the avoidance of defects during doping are still challenges. (8,54) We suggest using C5NCl5 as the precursor to grow graphene containing high-density and highly ordered nitrogen dopants on a Cu(111) surface. (55)
Such a process relies on the elegant concerted roles played by London dispersion, chemical bonding, and screened Coulomb repulsive forces in enhancing molecular adsorption, facilitating easy dechlorination, and dictating the overall orientation of the C5N radicals, respectively. First-principles calculations show that C5NCl5 can be stably adsorbed on Cu(111) due to strong London dispersion forces (Figure 7a). The dechlorination barrier of C5NCl5 is below 0.76 eV, and the whole dechlorination process is exothermic (Figure 7b). Moderate migration barriers and strong Coulomb repulsion can assemble C5N radicals in an orderly manner (Figure 7c). The obtained free-standing N-doped graphene is stable and metallic with a high carrier density.

6. Summary and Outlook
In this Account, we summarized our recent progress in understanding graphene growth. We demonstrated that atomistic simulations are a powerful tool for mechanism exploration. From the simulations, we can construct a complex kinetic network of growth and identify the dominant pathways. The obtained kinetics can also be directly compared with experiment. Agreement between simulation and experiment can further verify the obtained mechanisms. With such mechanistic insight, we can theoretically design new growth protocols, in which key experimental parameters can be quantitatively estimated from theory. We expect that this encouraging progress will inspire more theoretical studies into 2D material growth using atomistic simulations.
Certainly, large challenges remain. Although we now largely understand the growth mechanisms, atomic details of the graphene nucleation process remain elusive. On the methodology side, kinetic parameters in kMC simulations are typically obtained from DFT calculations on an ideal surface model within the transition state theory framework. Distortion of the substrate structure and the anharmonicity effect are generally not incorporated in the determination of event rates, though these effects are expected to be significant at the high temperature of graphene growth. A possible remedy is feeding kMC simulations with rates determined from MD simulations supported by advanced sampling techniques. To avoid overlooking important events, on-the-fly kMC simulations can be used. All these considerations require vast computational resources. An accurate force field, possibly based on machine learning, (56) is thus highly desirable. Future progress in these directions will further deepen our understanding of graphene growth and enhance the use of atomistic simulations as a tool for mechanism exploration.
