[1] "The oxidative dehydrogenation of propane by CO2 (CO2-ODHP) can potentially fill this gap while consuming a greenhouse gas."

[2] "Non-precious FeNi and precious NiPt catalysts supported on CeO2 have been identified as promising catalysts for CO2-ODHP and dry reforming, respectively, in flow reactor studies conducted at 823 K."

[3] "The XANES data identified that under reaction conditions the Ni3Pt catalyst consisted of metallic Pt (Supplementary Fig. 9) and that both the Fe3Ni and Ni3Pt catalysts consisted of metallic Ni (Fig. 3a). On the other hand, the Fe in the Fe3Ni catalyst was in the oxidized form."

[4] "DFT calculations were performed on bulk-terminated-Fe3Ni(111) and Pt-terminated-Ni3Pt(111) surfaces (Supplementary Fig. 10) to further gain insight into the potential reaction pathways for the oxidative CH and CC bond cleavage of propane to form *CH3CHCH2+H2O(g) and *CH3CH2+*CO+H2O(g), respectively."

[5] "Overall the DFT results reveal that the CC bond cleavage pathway is preferred on Ni3Pt(111), while bulk-terminated-Fe3Ni (111) favors the CH bond cleavage pathway."

The literature does not provide a comprehensive comparison of C-H bond activation mechanisms and catalyst regeneration for redox-active and redox-inactive metal oxide catalysts in oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes. However, it does discuss some aspects of CO2-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (CO2-ODHP) using bimetallic catalysts.

The study focuses on two types of bimetallic catalysts supported on CeO2: non-precious FeNi and precious NiPt. These catalysts were found to be promising for CO2-ODHP and dry reforming, respectively. The mechanisms of C-H bond activation differ between these catalysts:

1. Fe3Ni catalyst: 
- Favors CH bond cleavage pathway
- Fe is in an oxidized form under reaction conditions
- Selective for propylene production (CO2-ODHP)

2. Ni3Pt catalyst:
- Favors CC bond cleavage pathway
- Both Ni and Pt are in metallic form under reaction conditions
- Shows good activity and CO selectivity (dry reforming)

The study does not explicitly discuss the role of traditional oxidants versus CO2 in these reactions. However, it mentions that CO2 acts as a mild oxidant, which can increase the equilibrium conversion of propane by consuming H2 through the reverse water gas shift reaction.

Regarding the effectiveness of different catalysts in activating CO2 for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane, the study does not provide a comprehensive comparison including V2O5, VOx/SiO2, or other transition metal clusters. It focuses primarily on the Fe3Ni and Ni3Pt bimetallic catalysts supported on CeO2.

The proposed mechanisms and energy barriers for CO2 dissociation are not explicitly discussed in the given literature. However, DFT calculations were performed to understand the reaction pathways for oxidative CH and CC bond cleavage of propane on the catalyst surfaces. These calculations suggest that the bulk-terminated Fe3Ni(111) surface and the FeO/Ni(111) interface favor CH bond scission for the CO2-ODHP pathway, while the Pt-terminated Ni3Pt(111) surface favors CC bond cleavage for the dry reforming pathway.

该文献并未全面比较氧化还原活性和氧化还原惰性金属氧化物催化剂在烷烃氧化脱氢中的C-H键活化机理和催化剂再生。然而，它确实讨论了一些使用双金属催化剂进行CO2辅助丙烷氧化脱氢(CO2-ODHP)的方面。

研究重点关注了两种类型的以CeO2为载体的双金属催化剂：非贵金属FeNi和贵金属NiPt。这些催化剂分别被发现对CO2-ODHP和干重整反应有良好的催化效果。这些催化剂的C-H键活化机理不同：

1. Fe3Ni催化剂：
- 倾向于CH键断裂途径
- 在反应条件下Fe处于氧化状态
- 对丙烯生产具有选择性(CO2-ODHP)

2. Ni3Pt催化剂：
- 倾向于CC键断裂途径
- 在反应条件下Ni和Pt都处于金属态
- 显示出良好的活性和CO选择性(干重整)

该研究并未明确讨论传统氧化剂与CO2在这些反应中的作用。然而，它提到CO2作为温和的氧化剂，可以通过逆水气变换反应消耗H2来增加丙烷的平衡转化率。

关于不同催化剂在活化CO2进行丙烷氧化脱氢方面的有效性，该研究并未提供包括V2O5、VOx/SiO2或其他过渡金属簇在内的全面比较。它主要关注以CeO2为载体的Fe3Ni和Ni3Pt双金属催化剂。

给定的文献中并未明确讨论CO2解离的提议机理和能量障碍。然而，进行了密度泛函理论(DFT)计算，以了解在催化剂表面上丙烷氧化CH和CC键断裂的反应途径。这些计算表明，体相终止的Fe3Ni(111)表面和FeO/Ni(111)界面有利于CO2-ODHP途径的CH键断裂，而Pt终止的Ni3Pt(111)表面有利于干重整途径的CC键断裂。
