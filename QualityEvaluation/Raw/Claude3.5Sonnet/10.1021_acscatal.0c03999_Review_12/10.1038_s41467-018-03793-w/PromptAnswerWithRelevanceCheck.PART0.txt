[4] "Unlike regular oxidative dehydrogenation with molecular oxygen, CO2 as a mild oxidant suppresses over-oxidation and thus minimizes the production of carbon oxides."

[5] "The DFT calculation results indicate that the bulk Fe3Ni(111) surface and the FeO/Ni(111) interface should favor CH bond scission for the CO2-ODHP pathway, whereas the Pt-terminated Ni3Pt(111) surface should favor the CC bond cleavage for the DRP pathway."

The mechanisms of C-H bond activation and catalyst regeneration differ between redox-active and redox-inactive metal oxide catalysts in the oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of alkanes. Traditional oxidants like O2 typically involve a Mars-van Krevelen mechanism with redox-active catalysts, where lattice oxygen participates in the reaction. In contrast, CO2 as an oxidant offers a milder alternative that can suppress over-oxidation.

For CO2-ODHP, the effectiveness of catalysts varies. CeO2-supported bimetallic catalysts like FeNi and NiPt have shown promise. The FeNi catalyst favors C-H bond activation for the ODH pathway, while NiPt promotes C-C bond cleavage for dry reforming. The choice of catalyst influences the reaction pathway and product selectivity.

CO2 activation mechanisms differ among catalysts. On FeNi surfaces, CO2 likely dissociates to provide oxygen for the ODH reaction. The FeO/Ni interface facilitates selective C-H bond scission to produce propylene. In contrast, on Pt-terminated Ni3Pt surfaces, CO2 activation leads to C-C bond cleavage, promoting the dry reforming pathway.

The effectiveness of CO2 as an oxidant is also related to its ability to shift the reaction equilibrium by consuming H2 through the reverse water-gas shift reaction. This increases propane conversion compared to direct dehydrogenation.

While specific energy barriers for CO2 dissociation are not provided, the study suggests that the nature of the catalyst surface (e.g., bulk Fe3Ni, FeO/Ni interface, or Pt-terminated Ni3Pt) significantly influences the activation pathway and energy barriers for CO2-mediated reactions.

在烷烃的氧化脱氢(ODH)反应中，氧化还原活性和非活性金属氧化物催化剂的C-H键活化和催化剂再生机理存在差异。传统的氧化剂如O2通常在氧化还原活性催化剂上遵循Mars-van Krevelen机理，其中晶格氧参与反应。相比之下，CO2作为氧化剂提供了一种更温和的替代方案，可以抑制过度氧化。

对于CO2-ODHP，不同催化剂的有效性各不相同。CeO2负载的双金属催化剂如FeNi和NiPt表现出良好的前景。FeNi催化剂有利于ODH途径的C-H键活化，而NiPt促进干重整的C-C键断裂。催化剂的选择影响反应途径和产物选择性。

CO2的活化机理因催化剂而异。在FeNi表面，CO2可能解离以提供ODH反应所需的氧。FeO/Ni界面促进选择性C-H键断裂生成丙烯。相比之下，在Pt终止的Ni3Pt表面，CO2的活化导致C-C键断裂，促进干重整途径。

CO2作为氧化剂的有效性还与其通过逆水气变换反应消耗H2从而改变反应平衡的能力有关。这增加了与直接脱氢相比的丙烷转化率。

虽然没有提供CO2解离的具体能垒，但研究表明催化剂表面的性质（如体相Fe3Ni、FeO/Ni界面或Pt终止的Ni3Pt）显著影响CO2介导反应的活化途径和能垒。

The literature does not provide a comprehensive comparison of C-H bond activation mechanisms and catalyst regeneration for redox-active and redox-inactive metal oxide catalysts in oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes. However, it does discuss some aspects of CO2-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (CO2-ODHP) using bimetallic catalysts.

The study focuses on two types of bimetallic catalysts supported on CeO2: non-precious FeNi and precious NiPt. These catalysts were found to be promising for CO2-ODHP and dry reforming, respectively. The mechanisms of C-H bond activation differ between these catalysts:

1. Fe3Ni catalyst: 
- Favors CH bond cleavage pathway
- Fe is in an oxidized form under reaction conditions
- Selective for propylene production (CO2-ODHP)

2. Ni3Pt catalyst:
- Favors CC bond cleavage pathway
- Both Ni and Pt are in metallic form under reaction conditions
- Shows good activity and CO selectivity (dry reforming)

The study does not explicitly discuss the role of traditional oxidants versus CO2 in these reactions. However, it mentions that CO2 acts as a mild oxidant, which can increase the equilibrium conversion of propane by consuming H2 through the reverse water gas shift reaction.

Regarding the effectiveness of different catalysts in activating CO2 for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane, the study does not provide a comprehensive comparison including V2O5, VOx/SiO2, or other transition metal clusters. It focuses primarily on the Fe3Ni and Ni3Pt bimetallic catalysts supported on CeO2.

The proposed mechanisms and energy barriers for CO2 dissociation are not explicitly discussed in the given literature. However, DFT calculations were performed to understand the reaction pathways for oxidative CH and CC bond cleavage of propane on the catalyst surfaces. These calculations suggest that the bulk-terminated Fe3Ni(111) surface and the FeO/Ni(111) interface favor CH bond scission for the CO2-ODHP pathway, while the Pt-terminated Ni3Pt(111) surface favors CC bond cleavage for the dry reforming pathway.

该文献并未全面比较氧化还原活性和氧化还原惰性金属氧化物催化剂在烷烃氧化脱氢中的C-H键活化机理和催化剂再生。然而，它确实讨论了一些使用双金属催化剂进行CO2辅助丙烷氧化脱氢(CO2-ODHP)的方面。

研究重点关注了两种类型的以CeO2为载体的双金属催化剂：非贵金属FeNi和贵金属NiPt。这些催化剂分别被发现对CO2-ODHP和干重整反应有良好的催化效果。这些催化剂的C-H键活化机理不同：

1. Fe3Ni催化剂：
- 倾向于CH键断裂途径
- 在反应条件下Fe处于氧化状态
- 对丙烯生产具有选择性(CO2-ODHP)

2. Ni3Pt催化剂：
- 倾向于CC键断裂途径
- 在反应条件下Ni和Pt都处于金属态
- 显示出良好的活性和CO选择性(干重整)

该研究并未明确讨论传统氧化剂与CO2在这些反应中的作用。然而，它提到CO2作为温和的氧化剂，可以通过逆水气变换反应消耗H2来增加丙烷的平衡转化率。

关于不同催化剂在活化CO2进行丙烷氧化脱氢方面的有效性，该研究并未提供包括V2O5、VOx/SiO2或其他过渡金属簇在内的全面比较。它主要关注以CeO2为载体的Fe3Ni和Ni3Pt双金属催化剂。

给定的文献中并未明确讨论CO2解离的提议机理和能量障碍。然而，进行了密度泛函理论(DFT)计算，以了解在催化剂表面上丙烷氧化CH和CC键断裂的反应途径。这些计算表明，体相终止的Fe3Ni(111)表面和FeO/Ni(111)界面有利于CO2-ODHP途径的CH键断裂，而Pt终止的Ni3Pt(111)表面有利于干重整途径的CC键断裂。

The literature does not provide a comprehensive comparison of C-H bond activation mechanisms between redox-active and redox-inactive metal oxide catalysts for oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes. However, it does offer some insights into the use of CO2 as an oxidant and the performance of certain catalysts for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP).

CO2 is described as a mild oxidant that suppresses over-oxidation and minimizes the production of carbon oxides compared to regular oxidative dehydrogenation with molecular oxygen. This suggests that CO2 may play a unique role in the catalyst regeneration process, potentially allowing for more selective oxidation of the alkane.

The study focuses on bimetallic catalysts supported on CeO2 for CO2-ODHP. Specifically, Fe3Ni/CeO2 shows promising selectivity towards propylene production via the CO2-ODHP pathway. The mechanism proposed involves CH bond scission, which is favored by the bulk Fe3Ni(111) surface and the FeO/Ni(111) interface according to DFT calculations.

In situ XANES measurements reveal that the Fe3Ni catalyst consists of oxidized Fe and metallic Ni. This suggests that the oxidized Fe may play a role in activating CO2, while the metallic Ni could be involved in C-H bond activation.

The study does not explicitly discuss the effectiveness of V2O5, VOx/SiO2, or transition metal clusters in activating CO2 for ODHP. However, it does mention that CeO2 was used as a support due to its ability to store/release oxygen and potentially induce direct CO bond scission of CO2.

Overall, while the study provides valuable insights into CO2-ODHP using bimetallic catalysts, it does not offer a comprehensive comparison of mechanisms across different types of metal oxide catalysts or a detailed discussion of CO2 activation barriers for various catalysts.

文献并未提供氧化还原活性和氧化还原非活性金属氧化物催化剂在烷烃氧化脱氢反应中C-H键活化机理的全面比较。然而，它确实提供了一些关于使用CO2作为氧化剂以及某些催化剂在丙烷氧化脱氢(ODHP)中性能的见解。

CO2被描述为一种温和的氧化剂，与常规分子氧氧化脱氢相比，它抑制过度氧化并最大限度地减少碳氧化物的产生。这表明CO2可能在催化剂再生过程中发挥独特作用，potentially允许更选择性地氧化烷烃。

该研究主要关注了CeO2负载的双金属催化剂用于CO2-ODHP。具体来说，Fe3Ni/CeO2通过CO2-ODHP途径显示出良好的丙烯生成选择性。根据DFT计算，所提出的机理涉及CH键断裂，这一过程在Fe3Ni(111)体相表面和FeO/Ni(111)界面上更容易发生。

原位XANES测量表明，Fe3Ni催化剂由氧化态Fe和金属态Ni组成。这表明氧化态Fe可能在活化CO2中发挥作用，而金属态Ni可能参与C-H键的活化。

该研究并未明确讨论V2O5、VOx/SiO2或过渡金属簇在活化CO2用于ODHP方面的有效性。然而，它确实提到CeO2被用作载体，因为它具有储存/释放氧的能力，并可能诱导CO2的直接CO键断裂。

总的来说，虽然该研究为使用双金属催化剂进行CO2-ODHP提供了宝贵的见解，但它并未提供不同类型金属氧化物催化剂机理的全面比较，也没有详细讨论各种催化剂的CO2活化能垒。

However, it does offer some insights into the role of CO2 as an oxidant and the effectiveness of different catalysts for CO2-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (CO2-ODHP).

CO2 acts as a mild oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation process, offering several advantages over traditional oxidants like molecular oxygen:

1. It increases the equilibrium conversion of propane by consuming H2 through the reverse water gas shift reaction.

2. It suppresses over-oxidation, minimizing the production of carbon oxides.

3. It can potentially mitigate coke formation on catalysts.

The literature discusses several catalysts for CO2-ODHP, including:

1. CeO2 (ceria): It can store and release oxygen, potentially inducing direct CO bond scission of CO2 and providing lattice oxygen for coke suppression.

2. Bimetallic catalysts:

   - Ni3Pt: Favors C-C bond cleavage for the dry reforming of propane (DRP) pathway.

3. Precious metal catalysts (e.g., Rh, Re, Ru) on high surface area Al2O3: Used to alleviate coke formation.

The effectiveness of these catalysts varies based on their composition and structure. The bimetallic catalysts show different selectivities, with Fe3Ni promoting propylene production through C-H bond activation, while Ni3Pt favors syngas production through C-C bond cleavage.

The literature does not provide specific information on the proposed mechanisms and energy barriers for CO2 dissociation on these catalysts. However, it suggests that the ability of CeO2 to store and release oxygen may play a role in CO2 activation and subsequent oxidative dehydrogenation.

However, it does offer some insights into the role of CO2 as an oxidant and the effectiveness of different catalysts for CO2-ODHP (oxidative dehydrogenation of propane with CO2).

CO2 acts as a mild oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane, offering several advantages over traditional oxidants like molecular oxygen:

1. It increases the equilibrium conversion of propane by consuming H2 through the reverse water gas shift reaction.
2. It suppresses over-oxidation, minimizing the production of carbon oxides.

The effectiveness of different catalysts for CO2-ODHP varies:

1. Ceria (CeO2) is considered a good oxide support due to its oxygen storage/release capability, which may facilitate direct CO bond scission of CO2 and provide lattice oxygen for coke suppression.

2. Bimetallic catalysts show promising results:
   - Fe3Ni supported on CeO2 favors C-H bond scission, promoting the CO2-ODHP pathway to produce propylene.
   - Pt-terminated Ni3Pt favors C-C bond cleavage, leading to dry reforming of propane (DRP) to produce syngas.

3. Precious metal catalysts (e.g., Rh, Re, Ru) on high surface area Al2O3 have been investigated to alleviate coke formation, which is a common issue in these reactions.

The mechanisms and energy barriers for CO2 dissociation are not explicitly discussed in the given literature. However, the study emphasizes the importance of catalyst composition and structure in determining the preferred reaction pathway (C-H vs. C-C bond activation) and product selectivity.

In conclusion, while the literature provides some insights into CO2-ODHP catalysts and their effectiveness, it does not offer a comprehensive comparison of redox-active and redox-inactive metal oxide catalysts or detailed mechanisms for C-H bond activation and catalyst regeneration across different catalyst types.
