The literature does not provide a comprehensive comparison of C-H bond activation mechanisms between redox-active and redox-inactive metal oxide catalysts for oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes. However, it does offer some insights into the use of CO2 as an oxidant and the performance of certain catalysts for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP).

CO2 is described as a mild oxidant that suppresses over-oxidation and minimizes the production of carbon oxides compared to regular oxidative dehydrogenation with molecular oxygen. This suggests that CO2 may play a unique role in the catalyst regeneration process, potentially allowing for more selective oxidation of the alkane.

The study focuses on bimetallic catalysts supported on CeO2 for CO2-ODHP. Specifically, Fe3Ni/CeO2 shows promising selectivity towards propylene production via the CO2-ODHP pathway. The mechanism proposed involves CH bond scission, which is favored by the bulk Fe3Ni(111) surface and the FeO/Ni(111) interface according to DFT calculations.

In situ XANES measurements reveal that the Fe3Ni catalyst consists of oxidized Fe and metallic Ni. This suggests that the oxidized Fe may play a role in activating CO2, while the metallic Ni could be involved in C-H bond activation.

The study does not explicitly discuss the effectiveness of V2O5, VOx/SiO2, or transition metal clusters in activating CO2 for ODHP. However, it does mention that CeO2 was used as a support due to its ability to store/release oxygen and potentially induce direct CO bond scission of CO2.

Overall, while the study provides valuable insights into CO2-ODHP using bimetallic catalysts, it does not offer a comprehensive comparison of mechanisms across different types of metal oxide catalysts or a detailed discussion of CO2 activation barriers for various catalysts.

文献并未提供氧化还原活性和氧化还原非活性金属氧化物催化剂在烷烃氧化脱氢反应中C-H键活化机理的全面比较。然而，它确实提供了一些关于使用CO2作为氧化剂以及某些催化剂在丙烷氧化脱氢(ODHP)中性能的见解。

CO2被描述为一种温和的氧化剂，与常规分子氧氧化脱氢相比，它抑制过度氧化并最大限度地减少碳氧化物的产生。这表明CO2可能在催化剂再生过程中发挥独特作用，potentially允许更选择性地氧化烷烃。

该研究主要关注了CeO2负载的双金属催化剂用于CO2-ODHP。具体来说，Fe3Ni/CeO2通过CO2-ODHP途径显示出良好的丙烯生成选择性。根据DFT计算，所提出的机理涉及CH键断裂，这一过程在Fe3Ni(111)体相表面和FeO/Ni(111)界面上更容易发生。

原位XANES测量表明，Fe3Ni催化剂由氧化态Fe和金属态Ni组成。这表明氧化态Fe可能在活化CO2中发挥作用，而金属态Ni可能参与C-H键的活化。

该研究并未明确讨论V2O5、VOx/SiO2或过渡金属簇在活化CO2用于ODHP方面的有效性。然而，它确实提到CeO2被用作载体，因为它具有储存/释放氧的能力，并可能诱导CO2的直接CO键断裂。

总的来说，虽然该研究为使用双金属催化剂进行CO2-ODHP提供了宝贵的见解，但它并未提供不同类型金属氧化物催化剂机理的全面比较，也没有详细讨论各种催化剂的CO2活化能垒。
