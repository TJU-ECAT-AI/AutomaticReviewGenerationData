The mechanisms of C-H bond activation and catalyst regeneration in oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of alkanes differ between redox-active and redox-inactive metal oxide catalysts:

For redox-active metal oxides like Cr, V, and Co oxides, the ODH process typically follows a Mars-van Krevelen mechanism. In this mechanism, the metal oxide catalyst provides lattice oxygen for C-H bond activation, forming the alkene and leaving an oxygen vacancy. The catalyst is then regenerated by oxidation with CO2, which fills the lattice oxygen vacancy.

In contrast, redox-inactive metal oxides like Ga oxides operate through a different mechanism involving heterolytic dissociation of the alkane and activation of CO2. This process does not rely on the redox properties of the catalyst.

Traditional oxidants like O2 can lead to over-oxidation and formation of CO2, while CO2 acts as a milder oxidant in ODH reactions. CO2 can modify catalyst surfaces, influencing activity and selectivity.

Different catalysts show varying effectiveness in activating CO2 for ODH of propane:

1. V2O5 and supported VOx catalysts: These can follow either a one-step ODH pathway or a two-step pathway involving the reverse water-gas shift (RWGS) reaction.

2. CeO2: While not explicitly discussed for propane ODH, CeO2 is known for its oxygen storage capacity and ability to activate CO2, which could be beneficial for ODH reactions.

3. Transition metal clusters: Bimetallic catalysts like Fe-Ni supported on CeO2 have shown promise in CO2 activation and selective C-H bond cleavage.

4. Mo2C: DFT calculations suggest that Mo2C has a high affinity for atomic oxygen adsorption and favors C-H bond cleavage over C-C bond scission in ethane ODH with CO2.

The effectiveness of these catalysts in CO2 activation and ODH depends on factors such as metal-support interactions, redox properties, and the ability to selectively cleave C-H bonds while preserving C-C bonds. The energy barriers for CO2 dissociation vary among catalysts, with some materials like CeO2 and certain transition metal clusters showing particular promise in facilitating CO2 activation.

烷烃氧化脱氢（ODH）反应中C-H键活化和催化剂再生的机制在氧化还原活性和非氧化还原活性金属氧化物催化剂之间存在差异：

对于Cr、V和Co等氧化还原活性金属氧化物，ODH过程通常遵循Mars-van Krevelen机制。在这种机制中，金属氧化物催化剂提供晶格氧用于C-H键活化，形成烯烃并留下氧空位。然后，催化剂通过与CO2的氧化作用再生，填补晶格氧空位。

相比之下，像Ga氧化物这样的非氧化还原活性金属氧化物通过不同的机制运作，包括烷烃的异裂解离和CO2的活化。这个过程不依赖于催化剂的氧化还原性质。

传统氧化剂如O2可能导致过度氧化和CO2的形成，而CO2在ODH反应中作为一种较温和的氧化剂。CO2可以修饰催化剂表面，影响活性和选择性。

不同的催化剂在活化CO2用于丙烷ODH方面表现出不同的效果：

1. V2O5和负载型VOx催化剂：这些可以遵循单步ODH途径或涉及逆水气变换（RWGS）反应的两步途径。

2. CeO2：虽然没有明确讨论用于丙烷ODH，但CeO2以其氧储存能力和活化CO2的能力而闻名，这可能对ODH反应有利。

3. 过渡金属簇：像负载在CeO2上的Fe-Ni这样的双金属催化剂在CO2活化和选择性C-H键断裂方面表现出前景。

4. Mo2C：DFT计算表明，Mo2C对原子氧吸附具有高亲和力，并且在CO2存在下的乙烷ODH中倾向于C-H键断裂而非C-C键断裂。

这些催化剂在CO2活化和ODH中的效果取决于金属-载体相互作用、氧化还原性质以及选择性断裂C-H键同时保留C-C键的能力等因素。CO2解离的能量障碍在不同催化剂之间有所不同，其中一些材料如CeO2和某些过渡金属簇在促进CO2活化方面表现出特别的前景。

The mechanisms of C-H bond activation and catalyst regeneration in oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of alkanes differ significantly between redox-active and redox-inactive metal oxide catalysts.

For redox-active metal oxide catalysts like Cr and V oxides, the mechanism involves a Mars-van Krevelen cycle. These catalysts readily donate lattice oxygen atoms to activate the C-H bonds in alkanes, forming alkenes and water. The reduced metal centers are then reoxidized by CO2, completing the catalytic cycle. This process allows for efficient turnover but can lead to issues with catalyst stability and coking.

In contrast, redox-inactive metal oxide catalysts like Ga oxides operate through a different mechanism. They activate alkanes through heterolytic dissociation and activate CO2 separately. This process does not involve the donation of lattice oxygen atoms, resulting in a different reaction pathway.

The effectiveness of different catalysts in activating CO2 for ODH of propane varies:

1. V2O5 and VOx/SiO2: These catalysts show activity for CO2-ODH, but their performance is heavily influenced by the nature of the support, which affects reducibility and dispersion.

2. CeO2: As a reducible support, CeO2 can release and recover oxygen atoms, facilitating CO2 activation through direct C=O scission. This property makes it an effective component in CO2-ODH catalysts.

3. Transition metal clusters: Bimetallic systems, such as FeOx/Ni interfaces, have shown promising results. DFT calculations predict that these interfaces are active for dehydrogenation of ethane, with lower energy barriers for oxidative dehydrogenation compared to competing reactions.

The proposed mechanisms and energy barriers for CO2 dissociation vary depending on the catalyst system. For instance, on FeOx/Ni(111) surfaces, DFT calculations show that oxidative dehydrogenation is energetically more favorable than oxygen insertion, explaining the high selectivity observed experimentally.

In summary, the choice of catalyst significantly impacts the CO2-ODH mechanism, with redox-active oxides following a Mars-van Krevelen cycle and redox-inactive oxides operating through heterolytic dissociation. The effectiveness of CO2 activation depends on the catalyst's ability to facilitate C=O bond scission and promote the desired reaction pathway over competing processes.

烷烃氧化脱氢(ODH)中C-H键活化和催化剂再生的机理在氧化还原活性和非氧化还原活性金属氧化物催化剂之间存在显著差异。

对于像Cr和V氧化物这样的氧化还原活性金属氧化物催化剂，其机理涉及Mars-van Krevelen循环。这些催化剂容易贡献晶格氧原子来活化烷烃中的C-H键，形成烯烃和水。然后，还原的金属中心被CO2重新氧化，完成催化循环。这个过程允许高效的周转，但可能导致催化剂稳定性和结焦问题。

相比之下，像Ga氧化物这样的非氧化还原活性金属氧化物催化剂通过不同的机理运作。它们通过杂化解离来活化烷烃，并单独活化CO2。这个过程不涉及晶格氧原子的贡献，导致不同的反应路径。

不同催化剂在活化CO2用于丙烷ODH方面的有效性各不相同：

1. V2O5和VOx/SiO2：这些催化剂显示出CO2-ODH的活性，但它们的性能受到支持物性质的严重影响，这影响了可还原性和分散性。

2. CeO2：作为一种可还原的支持物，CeO2可以释放和恢复氧原子，通过直接C=O断裂促进CO2活化。这种特性使其成为CO2-ODH催化剂的有效组分。

3. 过渡金属簇：双金属系统，如FeOx/Ni界面，已显示出有前景的结果。DFT计算预测这些界面对乙烷脱氢是活性的，与竞争反应相比，氧化脱氢的能量障碍更低。

CO2解离的提议机理和能量障碍根据催化剂系统的不同而变化。例如，在FeOx/Ni(111)表面上，DFT计算表明氧化脱氢在能量上比氧插入更有利，解释了实验中观察到的高选择性。

总之，催化剂的选择显著影响CO2-ODH机理，氧化还原活性氧化物遵循Mars-van Krevelen循环，而非氧化还原活性氧化物通过杂化解离运作。CO2活化的有效性取决于催化剂促进C=O键断裂和促进所需反应路径而非竞争过程的能力。

The mechanisms of C-H bond activation and catalyst regeneration in oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of alkanes differ between redox-active and redox-inactive metal oxide catalysts.

For redox-active metal oxide catalysts like Cr and V oxides, the mechanism typically involves a Mars-van Krevelen cycle. In this process, the metal oxide donates lattice oxygen to activate the C-H bond of the alkane, forming the alkene and reducing the metal oxide. The catalyst is then regenerated by reoxidation with an oxidant. When using CO2 as the oxidant (CO2-ODH), it fills the oxygen vacancy created in the metal oxide lattice.

Redox-inactive catalysts like Ga oxides operate through a different mechanism. They activate alkanes through heterolytic dissociation and activate CO2 separately. This typically occurs in a two-step process: first, the catalyst dehydrogenates the alkane to form the alkene and H2, then the H2 reacts with CO2 in a reverse water-gas shift reaction to form CO and H2O.

Traditional oxidants like O2 can lead to over-oxidation and formation of COx products, while CO2 acts as a milder oxidant. CO2 can also modify the surface properties of catalysts, influencing their activity and selectivity.

The effectiveness of different catalysts in activating CO2 for ODH of propane varies:

1. V2O5 and supported VOx catalysts are active for CO2-ODH but can suffer from low selectivity due to side reactions.

2. CeO2 supports can enhance CO2 activation due to their reducibility and oxygen storage capacity.

3. Transition metal clusters, particularly bimetallic systems like Fe-Ni supported on CeO2, have shown promising results. The FeO-Ni interface has been found to promote C-H bond activation over C-C bond cleavage, leading to higher selectivity for ODH products.

DFT calculations have provided insights into the energy barriers for different reaction pathways. For example, on the FeOx/Ni(111) surface, the oxidative dehydrogenation pathway has a lower activation energy (1.08 eV) compared to the competing O insertion pathway (1.67 eV), explaining the higher selectivity for ODH products.

The choice of catalyst and support plays a crucial role in determining the reaction mechanism and product distribution in CO2-ODH reactions. Balancing the ability to activate both CO2 and the alkane substrate while maintaining selectivity towards the desired alkene product remains a key challenge in catalyst design for these reactions.

像Ga氧化物这样的非氧化还原活性催化剂则通过不同的机理运作。它们通过异裂解离来活化烷烃，并单独活化CO2。这通常发生在两个步骤中：首先，催化剂使烷烃脱氢形成烯烃和H2，然后H2与CO2在逆水气变换反应中反应生成CO和H2O。

传统氧化剂如O2可能导致过度氧化并形成COx产物，而CO2作为一种较温和的氧化剂。CO2还可以修改催化剂的表面性质，影响其活性和选择性。

不同催化剂在活化CO2用于丙烷ODH反应的效果各不相同：

1. V2O5和负载型VOx催化剂对CO2-ODH反应有活性，但由于副反应可能导致选择性较低。

2. CeO2载体可以增强CO2的活化，这归因于其可还原性和储氧能力。

3. 过渡金属簇，特别是负载在CeO2上的双金属体系如Fe-Ni，已显示出有前景的结果。研究发现FeO-Ni界面促进C-H键活化而不是C-C键断裂，从而提高了ODH产物的选择性。

密度泛函理论（DFT）计算为不同反应途径的能量障碍提供了洞见。例如，在FeOx/Ni(111)表面上，氧化脱氢途径的活化能（1.08 eV）低于竞争性O插入途径（1.67 eV），解释了ODH产物较高的选择性。

催化剂和载体的选择在决定CO2-ODH反应的反应机理和产物分布方面起着关键作用。在催化剂设计中，平衡活化CO2和烷烃底物的能力，同时保持对所需烯烃产物的选择性，仍然是这些反应的一个关键挑战。

The mechanisms of C-H bond activation and catalyst regeneration in oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of alkanes differ between redox-active and redox-inactive metal oxide catalysts.

For redox-active metal oxide catalysts like Cr, V, and Co oxides, the mechanism typically follows a Mars-van Krevelen type redox cycle. In this process, the metal oxide donates an oxygen atom to the alkane, facilitating C-H bond activation and dehydrogenation. The reduced metal center is then re-oxidized by CO2, which fills the lattice oxygen vacancy. This completes the catalytic cycle and regenerates the active site.

In contrast, redox-inactive metal oxide catalysts like Ga oxides operate through a different mechanism. These catalysts facilitate the heterolytic dissociation of the alkane and activation of CO2 without undergoing redox changes themselves. The exact details of this mechanism are less well understood compared to the redox-active catalysts.

Traditional oxidants like O2 can lead to over-oxidation and formation of CO2, while CO2 acts as a milder oxidant in ODH reactions. CO2 not only serves as an oxidant but also shifts the reaction equilibrium by removing H2 through the reverse water-gas shift (RWGS) reaction.

Regarding the effectiveness of different catalysts in activating CO2 for ODH of propane:

1. V2O5 and supported VOx catalysts are among the most studied systems. They can operate through both a one-step ODH pathway and a two-step pathway involving the RWGS reaction. The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism is predominant for these catalysts.

2. CeO2-based catalysts have shown promise due to their ability to facilitate CO2 dissociation. The oxygen vacancies in CeO2 play a crucial role in CO2 activation, generating reactive oxygen species that participate in alkane activation.

3. Transition metal clusters, particularly when supported on CeO2, have shown interesting properties. For example, Ni particles at Ni-CeO2 interfaces can activate C2H6 using the oxygen species generated from CO2 dissociation on CeO2.

The energy barriers for CO2 dissociation vary depending on the catalyst system. CeO2-based catalysts generally show lower barriers for CO2 dissociation compared to other oxide supports. However, the overall effectiveness of a catalyst depends not only on its ability to activate CO2 but also on its selectivity towards the desired alkene product and its stability under reaction conditions.

烷烃氧化脱氢（ODH）中C-H键活化和催化剂再生的机理在氧化还原活性和非氧化还原活性金属氧化物催化剂之间存在差异。

对于Cr、V和Co氧化物等氧化还原活性金属氧化物催化剂，机理通常遵循Mars-van Krevelen型氧化还原循环。在这个过程中，金属氧化物向烷烃提供一个氧原子，促进C-H键活化和脱氢。然后，还原的金属中心被CO2重新氧化，填补晶格氧空位。这完成了催化循环并再生了活性位点。

相比之下，像Ga氧化物这样的非氧化还原活性金属氧化物催化剂通过不同的机理运作。这些催化剂促进烷烃的异裂解离和CO2的活化，而自身不发生氧化还原变化。与氧化还原活性催化剂相比，这种机理的确切细节还不太清楚。

传统的氧化剂如O2可能导致过度氧化和CO2的形成，而CO2在ODH反应中作为一种更温和的氧化剂。CO2不仅作为氧化剂，还通过逆水气变换（RWGS）反应除去H2来移动反应平衡。

关于不同催化剂在活化CO2用于丙烷ODH方面的效果：

1. V2O5和负载的VOx催化剂是研究最多的体系之一。它们可以通过单步ODH途径和涉及RWGS反应的两步途径运作。Mars-van Krevelen机理在这些催化剂中占主导地位。

2. 基于CeO2的催化剂由于其促进CO2解离的能力而显示出前景。CeO2中的氧空位在CO2活化中起关键作用，产生参与烷烃活化的活性氧物种。

3. 过渡金属簇，特别是当负载在CeO2上时，显示出有趣的性质。例如，Ni-CeO2界面上的Ni颗粒可以利用CeO2上CO2解离产生的氧物种来活化C2H6。

CO2解离的能垒因催化剂系统而异。与其他氧化物载体相比，基于CeO2的催化剂通常表现出较低的CO2解离能垒。然而，催化剂的整体效果不仅取决于其活化CO2的能力，还取决于其对所需烯烃产物的选择性以及在反应条件下的稳定性。
