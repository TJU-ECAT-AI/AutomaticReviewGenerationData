The mechanisms of C-H bond activation and catalyst regeneration in oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of alkanes differ between redox-active and redox-inactive metal oxide catalysts.

For redox-active metal oxide catalysts like Cr, V, and Co oxides, the mechanism typically follows a Mars-van Krevelen type redox cycle. In this process, the metal oxide donates an oxygen atom to the alkane, facilitating C-H bond activation and dehydrogenation. The reduced metal center is then re-oxidized by CO2, which fills the lattice oxygen vacancy. This completes the catalytic cycle and regenerates the active site.

In contrast, redox-inactive metal oxide catalysts like Ga oxides operate through a different mechanism. These catalysts facilitate the heterolytic dissociation of the alkane and activation of CO2 without undergoing redox changes themselves. The exact details of this mechanism are less well understood compared to the redox-active catalysts.

Traditional oxidants like O2 can lead to over-oxidation and formation of CO2, while CO2 acts as a milder oxidant in ODH reactions. CO2 not only serves as an oxidant but also shifts the reaction equilibrium by removing H2 through the reverse water-gas shift (RWGS) reaction.

Regarding the effectiveness of different catalysts in activating CO2 for ODH of propane:

1. V2O5 and supported VOx catalysts are among the most studied systems. They can operate through both a one-step ODH pathway and a two-step pathway involving the RWGS reaction. The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism is predominant for these catalysts.

2. CeO2-based catalysts have shown promise due to their ability to facilitate CO2 dissociation. The oxygen vacancies in CeO2 play a crucial role in CO2 activation, generating reactive oxygen species that participate in alkane activation.

3. Transition metal clusters, particularly when supported on CeO2, have shown interesting properties. For example, Ni particles at Ni-CeO2 interfaces can activate C2H6 using the oxygen species generated from CO2 dissociation on CeO2.

The energy barriers for CO2 dissociation vary depending on the catalyst system. CeO2-based catalysts generally show lower barriers for CO2 dissociation compared to other oxide supports. However, the overall effectiveness of a catalyst depends not only on its ability to activate CO2 but also on its selectivity towards the desired alkene product and its stability under reaction conditions.

烷烃氧化脱氢（ODH）中C-H键活化和催化剂再生的机理在氧化还原活性和非氧化还原活性金属氧化物催化剂之间存在差异。

对于Cr、V和Co氧化物等氧化还原活性金属氧化物催化剂，机理通常遵循Mars-van Krevelen型氧化还原循环。在这个过程中，金属氧化物向烷烃提供一个氧原子，促进C-H键活化和脱氢。然后，还原的金属中心被CO2重新氧化，填补晶格氧空位。这完成了催化循环并再生了活性位点。

相比之下，像Ga氧化物这样的非氧化还原活性金属氧化物催化剂通过不同的机理运作。这些催化剂促进烷烃的异裂解离和CO2的活化，而自身不发生氧化还原变化。与氧化还原活性催化剂相比，这种机理的确切细节还不太清楚。

传统的氧化剂如O2可能导致过度氧化和CO2的形成，而CO2在ODH反应中作为一种更温和的氧化剂。CO2不仅作为氧化剂，还通过逆水气变换（RWGS）反应除去H2来移动反应平衡。

关于不同催化剂在活化CO2用于丙烷ODH方面的效果：

1. V2O5和负载的VOx催化剂是研究最多的体系之一。它们可以通过单步ODH途径和涉及RWGS反应的两步途径运作。Mars-van Krevelen机理在这些催化剂中占主导地位。

2. 基于CeO2的催化剂由于其促进CO2解离的能力而显示出前景。CeO2中的氧空位在CO2活化中起关键作用，产生参与烷烃活化的活性氧物种。

3. 过渡金属簇，特别是当负载在CeO2上时，显示出有趣的性质。例如，Ni-CeO2界面上的Ni颗粒可以利用CeO2上CO2解离产生的氧物种来活化C2H6。

CO2解离的能垒因催化剂系统而异。与其他氧化物载体相比，基于CeO2的催化剂通常表现出较低的CO2解离能垒。然而，催化剂的整体效果不仅取决于其活化CO2的能力，还取决于其对所需烯烃产物的选择性以及在反应条件下的稳定性。
