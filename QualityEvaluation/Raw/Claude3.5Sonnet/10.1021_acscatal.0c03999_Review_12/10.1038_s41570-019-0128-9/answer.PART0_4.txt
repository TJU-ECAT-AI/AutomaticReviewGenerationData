[1] "The most prevalent catalysts for CO2-ODH of light alkanes are oxides3,24,28 of Cr (refs2931), V (refs3234), Ga(refs35,36) and, to a lesser extent, In (refs37,38) and Co (refs3941). The catalytic activity of transition-metal oxides is typically attributed to their redox activity, which is necessary to effect O atom transfers."

[2] "Cr oxide catalysts. Cr oxide catalysts for the CO2-ODH can give high C2H6 conversions even after short reaction times, but the selectivity for CO2 conversion is low and the catalysts have short life cycles because they are unstable towards coking52."

[3] "The activation of CO2 over CrOx dispersed in MCM-41 has been attributed to isolated Crvi centres generated from Criii in a redox cycle5559"

[4] "Ga oxide catalysts for the CO2-ODH differ from those described above because the former are typically not redox-active over the relevant potential range and the catalysts operate through heterolytic dissociation of the alkane and activation of CO2"

[5] "DFT calculations of the oxidative dehydrogenation and reforming pathways on Ni(111) and FeOx/Ni(111) surfaces predict that Ni(111) should favour CC scission, while FeOx/Ni(111) could promote CH cleavage."

The mechanisms of C-H bond activation and catalyst regeneration in oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of alkanes differ significantly between redox-active and redox-inactive metal oxide catalysts.

For redox-active catalysts like Cr and V oxides, the mechanism typically involves a Mars-van Krevelen cycle. The metal center undergoes reduction as it donates an oxygen atom to dehydrogenate the alkane. The reduced metal is then reoxidized by CO2, completing the cycle. This redox activity allows for efficient O atom transfer and catalyst regeneration.

In contrast, redox-inactive catalysts like Ga oxides operate through a different mechanism. They activate alkanes through heterolytic dissociation and activate CO2 separately. The process does not involve changes in the oxidation state of the metal.

Regarding CO2 activation, different catalysts show varying effectiveness:

1. Cr oxides can efficiently activate CO2, but suffer from rapid deactivation due to coking.

2. V oxides, particularly when supported (e.g., VOx/SiO2), show good activity for CO2 activation and ODH.

3. CeO2, while not discussed extensively for propane ODH, is known for its ability to activate CO2 due to its oxygen storage capacity and mobility.

4. Transition metal clusters, such as FeNi bimetallic catalysts, show promise in activating CO2 for ODH. The FeOx/Ni interface has been found to promote C-H bond cleavage over C-C bond scission, making it effective for ODH.

The effectiveness of these catalysts in activating CO2 for ODH depends on their ability to dissociate CO2 and their selectivity towards C-H bond activation over C-C bond cleavage. The energy barriers for CO2 dissociation and subsequent reactions play a crucial role in determining catalyst performance, but specific values were not provided in the given literature.

烷烃氧化脱氢（ODH）中C-H键活化和催化剂再生的机理在氧化还原活性和非氧化还原活性金属氧化物催化剂之间存在显著差异。

对于像Cr和V氧化物这样的氧化还原活性催化剂，机理通常涉及Mars-van Krevelen循环。金属中心在向烷烃提供氧原子进行脱氢时会发生还原。然后，还原的金属被CO2重新氧化，完成循环。这种氧化还原活性允许高效的O原子转移和催化剂再生。

相比之下，像Ga氧化物这样的非氧化还原活性催化剂通过不同的机理运作。它们通过异裂解离活化烷烃，并单独活化CO2。这个过程不涉及金属氧化态的变化。

关于CO2的活化，不同的催化剂表现出不同的有效性：

1. Cr氧化物可以有效地活化CO2，但由于结焦而迅速失活。

2. V氧化物，特别是在有载体时（如VOx/SiO2），表现出良好的CO2活化和ODH活性。

3. CeO2虽然在丙烷ODH中没有广泛讨论，但由于其氧存储能力和移动性而被认为能够活化CO2。

4. 过渡金属簇，如FeNi双金属催化剂，在活化CO2用于ODH方面显示出前景。研究发现FeOx/Ni界面能够促进C-H键断裂而非C-C键断裂，使其对ODH有效。

这些催化剂在活化CO2用于ODH的有效性取决于它们解离CO2的能力以及对C-H键活化相对于C-C键断裂的选择性。CO2解离和后续反应的能量障碍在决定催化剂性能方面起着关键作用，但给定的文献中没有提供具体的数值。
