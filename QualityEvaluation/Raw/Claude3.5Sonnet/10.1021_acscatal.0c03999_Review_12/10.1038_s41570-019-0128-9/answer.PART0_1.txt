[1] "The best catalysts are oxides of reducible metal ions  metal centres that readily donate abundant lattice O atoms to allow efficient turnover"

[2] "Ga oxide catalysts for the CO2-ODH differ from those described above because the former are typically not redox-active over the relevant potential range and the catalysts operate through heterolytic dissociation of the alkane and activation of CO2"

[3] "Cr oxide catalysts. Cr oxide catalysts for the CO2-ODH can give high C2H6 conversions even after short reaction times, but the selectivity for CO2 conversion is low and the catalysts have short life cycles because they are unstable towards coking"

[4] "V oxide catalysts. As with Cr oxide catalysts for CO2-ODH, the activity of V derivatives also depends on the nature of the supports due to the latters effects on reducibility, acidbase properties and dispersion"

[5] "CeO2 because it is a reducible support that can release O atoms and then recover them by inducing direct C=O scission"

[6] "DFT calculations on FeOx/Ni(111) show that oxidative dehydrogenation (E=0.13eV and Ea=1.08eV) is more favourable than *O insertion (E=0.04eV and Ea=1.67eV). Thus, in agreement with the experimental results, the DFT calculations predict that the NiFeOx interface should be active for the dehydrogenation of C2H6, leading to the high CO2-ODH selectivity"

The mechanisms of C-H bond activation and catalyst regeneration in oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of alkanes differ significantly between redox-active and redox-inactive metal oxide catalysts.

For redox-active metal oxide catalysts like Cr and V oxides, the mechanism involves a Mars-van Krevelen cycle. These catalysts readily donate lattice oxygen atoms to activate the C-H bonds in alkanes, forming alkenes and water. The reduced metal centers are then reoxidized by CO2, completing the catalytic cycle. This process allows for efficient turnover but can lead to issues with catalyst stability and coking.

In contrast, redox-inactive metal oxide catalysts like Ga oxides operate through a different mechanism. They activate alkanes through heterolytic dissociation and activate CO2 separately. This process does not involve the donation of lattice oxygen atoms, resulting in a different reaction pathway.

The effectiveness of different catalysts in activating CO2 for ODH of propane varies:

1. V2O5 and VOx/SiO2: These catalysts show activity for CO2-ODH, but their performance is heavily influenced by the nature of the support, which affects reducibility and dispersion.

2. CeO2: As a reducible support, CeO2 can release and recover oxygen atoms, facilitating CO2 activation through direct C=O scission. This property makes it an effective component in CO2-ODH catalysts.

3. Transition metal clusters: Bimetallic systems, such as FeOx/Ni interfaces, have shown promising results. DFT calculations predict that these interfaces are active for dehydrogenation of ethane, with lower energy barriers for oxidative dehydrogenation compared to competing reactions.

The proposed mechanisms and energy barriers for CO2 dissociation vary depending on the catalyst system. For instance, on FeOx/Ni(111) surfaces, DFT calculations show that oxidative dehydrogenation is energetically more favorable than oxygen insertion, explaining the high selectivity observed experimentally.

In summary, the choice of catalyst significantly impacts the CO2-ODH mechanism, with redox-active oxides following a Mars-van Krevelen cycle and redox-inactive oxides operating through heterolytic dissociation. The effectiveness of CO2 activation depends on the catalyst's ability to facilitate C=O bond scission and promote the desired reaction pathway over competing processes.

烷烃氧化脱氢(ODH)中C-H键活化和催化剂再生的机理在氧化还原活性和非氧化还原活性金属氧化物催化剂之间存在显著差异。

对于像Cr和V氧化物这样的氧化还原活性金属氧化物催化剂，其机理涉及Mars-van Krevelen循环。这些催化剂容易贡献晶格氧原子来活化烷烃中的C-H键，形成烯烃和水。然后，还原的金属中心被CO2重新氧化，完成催化循环。这个过程允许高效的周转，但可能导致催化剂稳定性和结焦问题。

相比之下，像Ga氧化物这样的非氧化还原活性金属氧化物催化剂通过不同的机理运作。它们通过杂化解离来活化烷烃，并单独活化CO2。这个过程不涉及晶格氧原子的贡献，导致不同的反应路径。

不同催化剂在活化CO2用于丙烷ODH方面的有效性各不相同：

1. V2O5和VOx/SiO2：这些催化剂显示出CO2-ODH的活性，但它们的性能受到支持物性质的严重影响，这影响了可还原性和分散性。

2. CeO2：作为一种可还原的支持物，CeO2可以释放和恢复氧原子，通过直接C=O断裂促进CO2活化。这种特性使其成为CO2-ODH催化剂的有效组分。

3. 过渡金属簇：双金属系统，如FeOx/Ni界面，已显示出有前景的结果。DFT计算预测这些界面对乙烷脱氢是活性的，与竞争反应相比，氧化脱氢的能量障碍更低。

CO2解离的提议机理和能量障碍根据催化剂系统的不同而变化。例如，在FeOx/Ni(111)表面上，DFT计算表明氧化脱氢在能量上比氧插入更有利，解释了实验中观察到的高选择性。

总之，催化剂的选择显著影响CO2-ODH机理，氧化还原活性氧化物遵循Mars-van Krevelen循环，而非氧化还原活性氧化物通过杂化解离运作。CO2活化的有效性取决于催化剂促进C=O键断裂和促进所需反应路径而非竞争过程的能力。
