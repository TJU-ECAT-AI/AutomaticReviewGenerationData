"The most prevalent catalysts for CO2-ODH of light alkanes are oxides3,24,28 of Cr (refs2931), V (refs3234), Ga(refs35,36) and, to a lesser extent, In (refs37,38) and Co (refs3941)."

"The catalytic activity of transition-metal oxides is typically attributed to their redox activity, which is necessary to effect O atom transfers."

"To complete this redox-type Marsvan Krevelen mechanism, the metal centre undergoes oxidation by CO2 to fill the lattice O vacancy49"

"Ga oxide catalysts for the CO2-ODH differ from those described above because the former are typically not redox-active over the relevant potential range and the catalysts operate through heterolytic dissociation of the alkane and activation of CO2"

"DFT calculations and isotopic labelling experiments on the CO2-ODH of alkanes over (supported or unsupported) V-based catalysts indicate that both a one-step oxidative dehydrogenation pathway or a two-step pathway with the RWGS reaction are possible66,67."

"The majority of V-based catalysts operate through a Marsvan Krevelen mechanism68, a greater participation of O atoms from the support improves alkene selectivity, as observed for V2O5/CeO2ZrO2 in the CO2-ODH of C4H10"

"CeO2 helps enable facile CO2 dissociation to give a *O species that participates in C2H6 activation on the Ni particles at the NiCeO2 interfaces."

"Cr oxide catalysts for the CO2-ODH can give high C2H6 conversions even after short reaction times, but the selectivity for CO2 conversion is low and the catalysts have short life cycles because they are unstable towards coking52."

"The activation of CO2 over CrOx dispersed in MCM-41 has been attributed to isolated Crvi centres generated from Criii in a redox cycle5559"

"DFT calculations of the oxidative dehydrogenation and reforming pathways on Ni(111) and FeOx/Ni(111) surfaces predict that Ni(111) should favour CC scission, while FeOx/Ni(111) could promote CH cleavage."

The mechanisms of C-H bond activation and catalyst regeneration in oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of alkanes differ significantly between redox-active and redox-inactive metal oxide catalysts:

Redox-active catalysts (e.g., Cr, V, Co oxides):
- Operate through a Mars-van Krevelen mechanism
- Donate lattice oxygen for C-H bond activation, forming alkenes and reducing the metal center
- Regenerate by reoxidation with CO2, filling the oxygen vacancy

Redox-inactive catalysts (e.g., Ga oxides):
- Operate through heterolytic dissociation of alkanes and separate CO2 activation
- Do not involve changes in metal oxidation state

CO2 serves as a milder oxidant compared to O2, which can lead to over-oxidation. CO2 can also modify catalyst surfaces, influencing activity and selectivity.

Effectiveness of different catalysts in activating CO2 for ODH of propane:

1. V2O5 and supported VOx catalysts:
   - Can follow one-step ODH or two-step pathway with RWGS reaction
   - Operate primarily through Mars-van Krevelen mechanism
   - Support participation can improve alkene selectivity (e.g., V2O5/CeO2-ZrO2)

2. CeO2-based catalysts:
   - Facilitate CO2 dissociation, generating reactive oxygen species
   - Enhance CO2 activation due to oxygen storage capacity and oxygen vacancies
   - Improve performance when used as a support (e.g., Ni-CeO2 interfaces)

3. Cr oxide catalysts:
   - High initial activity but suffer from low selectivity and rapid deactivation due to coking
   - CO2 activation attributed to isolated Cr(VI) centers generated from Cr(III) in a redox cycle

4. Transition metal clusters:
   - Bimetallic systems (e.g., Fe-Ni) show promise in CO2 activation and selective C-H bond cleavage
   - FeOx/Ni(111) interfaces promote C-H cleavage over C-C scission

The effectiveness of these catalysts depends on their ability to activate both CO2 and the alkane substrate while maintaining selectivity towards the desired alkene product. Energy barriers for CO2 dissociation vary among catalysts, with CeO2-based systems generally showing lower barriers compared to other oxide supports.

烷烃氧化脱氢（ODH）反应中C-H键活化和催化剂再生的机制在氧化还原活性和非氧化还原活性金属氧化物催化剂之间存在显著差异：

氧化还原活性催化剂（如Cr、V、Co氧化物）：
- 通过Mars-van Krevelen机制运作
- 提供晶格氧用于C-H键活化，形成烯烃并还原金属中心
- 通过CO2再氧化再生，填补氧空位

非氧化还原活性催化剂（如Ga氧化物）：
- 通过烷烃的异裂解离和单独的CO2活化运作
- 不涉及金属氧化态的变化

CO2作为一种较温和的氧化剂，相比O2不易导致过度氧化。CO2还可以修饰催化剂表面，影响活性和选择性。

不同催化剂在活化CO2用于丙烷ODH方面的有效性：

1. V2O5和负载型VOx催化剂：
   - 可以遵循单步ODH或涉及RWGS反应的两步途径
   - 主要通过Mars-van Krevelen机制运作
   - 载体的参与可以提高烯烃选择性（如V2O5/CeO2-ZrO2）

2. 基于CeO2的催化剂：
   - 促进CO2解离，产生活性氧物种
   - 由于氧存储能力和氧空位而增强CO2活化
   - 作为载体时改善性能（如Ni-CeO2界面）

3. Cr氧化物催化剂：
   - 初始活性高但选择性低，由于结焦而迅速失活
   - CO2活化归因于在氧化还原循环中由Cr(III)生成的孤立Cr(VI)中心

4. 过渡金属簇：
   - 双金属系统（如Fe-Ni）在CO2活化和选择性C-H键断裂方面显示出前景
   - FeOx/Ni(111)界面促进C-H键断裂而非C-C键断裂

这些催化剂的有效性取决于它们活化CO2和烷烃底物的能力，同时保持对所需烯烃产物的选择性。CO2解离的能垒因催化剂而异，与其他氧化物载体相比，基于CeO2的系统通常表现出较低的能垒。
