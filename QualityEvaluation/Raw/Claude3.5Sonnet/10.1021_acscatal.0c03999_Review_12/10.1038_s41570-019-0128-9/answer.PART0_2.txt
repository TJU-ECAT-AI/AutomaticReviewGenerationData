[1] "The most prevalent catalysts for CO2-ODH of light alkanes are oxides of Cr, V, Ga and, to a lesser extent, In and Co. The catalytic activity of transition-metal oxides is typically attributed to their redox activity, which is necessary to effect O atom transfers."

[2] "Cr oxide catalysts for the CO2-ODH can give high C2H6 conversions even after short reaction times, but the selectivity for CO2 conversion is low and the catalysts have short life cycles because they are unstable towards coking."

[3] "Ga oxide catalysts for the CO2-ODH differ from those described above because the former are typically not redox-active over the relevant potential range and the catalysts operate through heterolytic dissociation of the alkane and activation of CO2"

[4] "Over Ni(111), the initial step of CC cleavage is more favourable than the corresponding step in CH scission. At the FeONi(111) interface, the initial steps in CH and CC cleavage are in competition, but the subsequent two steps of CH scission are more energetically favourable and afford surface-bound 1,3-butadiene."

[5] "DFT calculations on FeOx/Ni(111) show that oxidative dehydrogenation (ΔE=−0.13eV and Ea=1.08eV) is more favourable than *O insertion (ΔE=0.04eV and Ea=1.67eV). Thus, in agreement with the experimental results, the DFT calculations predict that the NiFeOx interface should be active for the dehydrogenation of C2H6, leading to the high CO2-ODH selectivity."

The mechanisms of C-H bond activation and catalyst regeneration in oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of alkanes differ between redox-active and redox-inactive metal oxide catalysts.

For redox-active metal oxide catalysts like Cr and V oxides, the mechanism typically involves a Mars-van Krevelen cycle. In this process, the metal oxide donates lattice oxygen to activate the C-H bond of the alkane, forming the alkene and reducing the metal oxide. The catalyst is then regenerated by reoxidation with an oxidant. When using CO2 as the oxidant (CO2-ODH), it fills the oxygen vacancy created in the metal oxide lattice.

Redox-inactive catalysts like Ga oxides operate through a different mechanism. They activate alkanes through heterolytic dissociation and activate CO2 separately. This typically occurs in a two-step process: first, the catalyst dehydrogenates the alkane to form the alkene and H2, then the H2 reacts with CO2 in a reverse water-gas shift reaction to form CO and H2O.

Traditional oxidants like O2 can lead to over-oxidation and formation of COx products, while CO2 acts as a milder oxidant. CO2 can also modify the surface properties of catalysts, influencing their activity and selectivity.

The effectiveness of different catalysts in activating CO2 for ODH of propane varies:

1. V2O5 and supported VOx catalysts are active for CO2-ODH but can suffer from low selectivity due to side reactions.

2. CeO2 supports can enhance CO2 activation due to their reducibility and oxygen storage capacity.

3. Transition metal clusters, particularly bimetallic systems like Fe-Ni supported on CeO2, have shown promising results. The FeO-Ni interface has been found to promote C-H bond activation over C-C bond cleavage, leading to higher selectivity for ODH products.

DFT calculations have provided insights into the energy barriers for different reaction pathways. For example, on the FeOx/Ni(111) surface, the oxidative dehydrogenation pathway has a lower activation energy (1.08 eV) compared to the competing O insertion pathway (1.67 eV), explaining the higher selectivity for ODH products.

The choice of catalyst and support plays a crucial role in determining the reaction mechanism and product distribution in CO2-ODH reactions. Balancing the ability to activate both CO2 and the alkane substrate while maintaining selectivity towards the desired alkene product remains a key challenge in catalyst design for these reactions.

烷烃氧化脱氢（ODH）反应中C-H键活化和催化剂再生的机理在氧化还原活性和非氧化还原活性金属氧化物催化剂之间存在差异。

对于像Cr和V氧化物这样的氧化还原活性金属氧化物催化剂，机理通常涉及Mars-van Krevelen循环。在这个过程中，金属氧化物提供晶格氧来活化烷烃的C-H键，形成烯烃并还原金属氧化物。然后催化剂通过氧化剂再氧化而再生。当使用CO2作为氧化剂（CO2-ODH）时，它会填补金属氧化物晶格中产生的氧空位。

像Ga氧化物这样的非氧化还原活性催化剂则通过不同的机理运作。它们通过异裂解离来活化烷烃，并单独活化CO2。这通常发生在两个步骤中：首先，催化剂使烷烃脱氢形成烯烃和H2，然后H2与CO2在逆水气变换反应中反应生成CO和H2O。

传统氧化剂如O2可能导致过度氧化并形成COx产物，而CO2作为一种较温和的氧化剂。CO2还可以修改催化剂的表面性质，影响其活性和选择性。

不同催化剂在活化CO2用于丙烷ODH反应的效果各不相同：

1. V2O5和负载型VOx催化剂对CO2-ODH反应有活性，但由于副反应可能导致选择性较低。

2. CeO2载体可以增强CO2的活化，这归因于其可还原性和储氧能力。

3. 过渡金属簇，特别是负载在CeO2上的双金属体系如Fe-Ni，已显示出有前景的结果。研究发现FeO-Ni界面促进C-H键活化而不是C-C键断裂，从而提高了ODH产物的选择性。

密度泛函理论（DFT）计算为不同反应途径的能量障碍提供了洞见。例如，在FeOx/Ni(111)表面上，氧化脱氢途径的活化能（1.08 eV）低于竞争性O插入途径（1.67 eV），解释了ODH产物较高的选择性。

催化剂和载体的选择在决定CO2-ODH反应的反应机理和产物分布方面起着关键作用。在催化剂设计中，平衡活化CO2和烷烃底物的能力，同时保持对所需烯烃产物的选择性，仍然是这些反应的一个关键挑战。
