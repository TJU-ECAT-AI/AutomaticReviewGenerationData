The mechanisms of C-H bond activation and catalyst regeneration differ between redox-active and redox-inactive metal oxide catalysts in the oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes. 

For redox-active catalysts like V2O5 and Cr2O3, the mechanism typically involves lattice oxygen participating in C-H bond activation, forming the alkene and reduced metal sites. These reduced sites are then re-oxidized by the oxidant. Traditional oxidants like O2 can directly re-oxidize the catalyst, decreasing reaction temperatures effectively. CO2 acts as a milder oxidant that helps maintain higher oxidation states of the metal species.

Redox-inactive catalysts like CeO2 generally activate C-H bonds through acid-base interactions rather than redox processes. Their regeneration does not involve changes in metal oxidation states.

The role of CO2 in oxidative dehydrogenation appears to be multifaceted:
1. Maintaining higher oxidation states of the catalyst, particularly for V2O5 and Cr2O3.
2. Removing hydrogen from products via the reverse water-gas shift reaction (CO2 + H2 → CO + H2O).
3. Eliminating deposited carbon through the reverse Boudouard reaction (CO2 + C → 2CO).

These mechanisms could help shift the equilibrium towards product formation and prevent catalyst deactivation due to coking.

Regarding catalyst effectiveness, oxidized diamond-supported Cr2O3 and V2O5 catalysts showed promising results for propane dehydrogenation in the presence of CO2. However, the literature does not provide direct comparisons to VOx/SiO2, CeO2, or transition metal clusters for CO2 activation.

The mechanisms for CO2 dissociation are not explicitly discussed, and the energy barriers for this process are not provided in the given text. More detailed mechanistic studies and comparisons to other catalyst systems would be needed to fully address the effectiveness of different catalysts in activating CO2 for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane.

The mechanisms of C-H bond activation and catalyst regeneration in oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of alkanes differ between redox-active and redox-inactive metal oxide catalysts. 

For redox-active catalysts like NiMo/Al2O3, the Mars-van Krevelen mechanism is typically followed. This involves the abstraction of hydrogen from the alkane by lattice oxygen (e.g., O-Mo species), followed by catalyst reoxidation by gas-phase oxidants. The process involves:
1. Transfer of hydrogens to surface oxygen species (e.g., O-Mo)
2. Formation of water molecules
3. Desorption of water, creating oxygen vacancies
4. Replenishment of vacancies with oxygen from gaseous oxidants (O2, N2O, or CO2)

Redox-inactive catalysts operate through different mechanisms, often involving the formation of active oxygen species on the catalyst surface.

Traditional oxidants like O2 are highly reactive but can lead to over-oxidation and lower selectivity. CO2 and N2O, considered "soft oxidants," offer improved selectivity by limiting the formation of electrophilic oxygen species that promote total oxidation. This results in higher selectivity towards desired products like butadiene.

The effectiveness of catalysts in activating CO2 for ODH varies. While specific information on V2O5, VOx/SiO2, CeO2, or transition metal clusters is not provided, the general principle is that catalysts capable of efficiently dissociating CO2 and creating active oxygen species without over-oxidizing the surface are considered more effective for CO2-assisted ODH reactions.

The mechanisms of C-H bond activation and catalyst regeneration differ between redox-active and redox-inactive metal oxide catalysts in oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of alkanes. CO2 acts as a milder oxidant compared to traditional oxidants like O2, suppressing over-oxidation and minimizing carbon oxide production.

For CO2-ODHP, bimetallic catalysts supported on CeO2 show promise:
1. Fe3Ni/CeO2 favors C-H bond activation for the ODH pathway, promoting propylene production.
2. Ni3Pt/CeO2 favors C-C bond cleavage, leading to dry reforming of propane.

The effectiveness of catalysts in activating CO2 varies:
- CeO2 support can store/release oxygen, potentially facilitating CO2 activation and providing lattice oxygen for coke suppression.
- Fe3Ni surfaces likely dissociate CO2 to provide oxygen for the ODH reaction.
- The FeO/Ni interface facilitates selective C-H bond scission.
- Pt-terminated Ni3Pt surfaces promote C-C bond cleavage for dry reforming.

CO2 also enhances propane conversion by consuming H2 through the reverse water-gas shift reaction. While specific energy barriers for CO2 dissociation are not provided, the catalyst surface composition significantly influences the activation pathway and energy barriers for CO2-mediated reactions.

The mechanism of C-H bond activation and catalyst regeneration in oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of alkanes over redox-active metal oxide catalysts, such as vanadium and molybdenum oxides, follows the Mars-van Krevelen redox mechanism. The process involves:

1. C-H bond activation: Ethane adsorbs to a surface or lattice oxygen atom, followed by C-H bond cleavage to form an ethoxy intermediate and a hydroxyl group on the catalyst surface. This step is considered rate-limiting.

2. Catalyst reduction: As the reaction proceeds, the catalyst surface is reduced as lattice oxygen atoms activate alkane molecules to form olefins.

3. Catalyst regeneration: Gas-phase oxygen adsorbs to the vacancies created on the catalyst surface and reoxidizes the active sites.

The choice of oxidant significantly affects the catalyst's oxidation state and performance:

1. O2 as oxidant: The catalyst remains fully oxidized, and increasing O2 concentration does not affect the ethylene formation rate. The molybdenum catalyst stays in the Mo(VI) state.

2. N2O as oxidant: The catalyst operates in a more reduced state, with a mixture of Mo(VI), Mo(V), and Mo(IV). Increasing N2O concentration increases the rate of catalyst re-oxidation. The activation energy for re-oxidation with N2O is 2.4 times higher than with O2, making the re-oxidation step kinetically relevant.

The use of N2O allows the catalyst to operate in a more reduced state, which can improve selectivity to desired olefin products. However, O2 can oxidize the reduced catalyst at lower temperatures due to its lower activation energy for re-oxidation.

The provided information does not discuss redox-inactive catalysts, the use of CO2 as an oxidant, or the effectiveness of different catalysts (V2O5, VOx/SiO2, CeO2, and transition metal clusters) in activating CO2 for propane ODH. Therefore, these aspects of the question cannot be addressed based on the given information.

The mechanisms of C-H bond activation and catalyst regeneration in oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of alkanes differ significantly between redox-active and redox-inactive metal oxide catalysts:

Redox-active catalysts (e.g., Cr, V, Co oxides):
- Operate through a Mars-van Krevelen mechanism
- Donate lattice oxygen for C-H bond activation, forming alkenes and reducing the metal center
- Regenerate by reoxidation with CO2, filling the oxygen vacancy

Redox-inactive catalysts (e.g., Ga oxides):
- Operate through heterolytic dissociation of alkanes and separate CO2 activation
- Do not involve changes in metal oxidation state

CO2 serves as a milder oxidant compared to O2, which can lead to over-oxidation. CO2 can also modify catalyst surfaces, influencing activity and selectivity.

Effectiveness of different catalysts in activating CO2 for ODH of propane:

1. V2O5 and supported VOx catalysts:
   - Can follow one-step ODH or two-step pathway with RWGS reaction
   - Operate primarily through Mars-van Krevelen mechanism
   - Support participation can improve alkene selectivity (e.g., V2O5/CeO2-ZrO2)

2. CeO2-based catalysts:
   - Facilitate CO2 dissociation, generating reactive oxygen species
   - Enhance CO2 activation due to oxygen storage capacity and oxygen vacancies
   - Improve performance when used as a support (e.g., Ni-CeO2 interfaces)

3. Cr oxide catalysts:
   - High initial activity but suffer from low selectivity and rapid deactivation due to coking
   - CO2 activation attributed to isolated Cr(VI) centers generated from Cr(III) in a redox cycle

4. Transition metal clusters:
   - Bimetallic systems (e.g., Fe-Ni) show promise in CO2 activation and selective C-H bond cleavage
   - FeOx/Ni(111) interfaces promote C-H cleavage over C-C scission

The effectiveness of these catalysts depends on their ability to activate both CO2 and the alkane substrate while maintaining selectivity towards the desired alkene product. Energy barriers for CO2 dissociation vary among catalysts, with CeO2-based systems generally showing lower barriers compared to other oxide supports.

The mechanisms of C-H bond activation and catalyst regeneration in oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of alkanes are primarily discussed for redox-active VOx catalysts, with a comparison between O2 and N2O as oxidants:

1. C-H bond activation:
   - The breaking of the weakest C-H bond in the alkane molecule is the rate-limiting step in ODH reactions.
   - This step occurs on the catalyst surface and is independent of the oxidant used.
   - The reactivity of alkanes increases as the strength of the weakest C-H bond decreases, following the order C2H6 < C3H8 < n-C4H10 < iso-C4H10.

2. Catalyst regeneration:
   - Follows a Mars-van Krevelen mechanism for both O2 and N2O oxidants.
   - Reduced VOx species are reoxidized by the oxidant, restoring lattice oxygen.
   - With O2: Forms peroxo species on reduced VOx, which then transform to lattice oxygen.
   - With N2O: Directly restores lattice oxygen without forming peroxo intermediates.

3. Oxidant comparison (O2 vs N2O):
   - N2O shows superior performance in terms of olefin selectivity.
   - N2O suppresses COx formation more effectively than O2.
   - O2 forms additional reactive oxygen species (possibly bi-atomic) that contribute to non-selective oxidation, while N2O does not form these species.

The literature does not discuss redox-inactive catalysts or the use of CO2 as an oxidant. It also does not provide information on other catalysts like V2O5, VOx/SiO2, CeO2, or transition metal clusters for CO2 activation in propane ODH.

The mechanisms of C-H bond activation and catalyst regeneration differ significantly between redox-active and redox-inactive metal oxide catalysts in the oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes.

For redox-active catalysts like traditional vanadium and molybdenum-based metal oxides, the reaction follows a redox mechanism. The rate-limiting step is the oxidation of propane by surface lattice oxygen from the transition metal oxides. This process involves the transfer of oxygen from the catalyst to the reactant, followed by the regeneration of the catalyst through re-oxidation.

In contrast, redox-inactive catalysts like hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) operate through a different mechanism. These catalysts have poor redox ability and cannot easily transfer oxygen from their lattice to the reactants. Instead, they catalyze the reaction through heterolytic C-H cleavage, followed by a reduction of the gas-phase oxidant rather than the surface.

The difference in mechanisms leads to distinct product distributions. Redox-active catalysts tend to produce more carbon oxides (COx) as by-products, while redox-inactive catalysts like h-BN show very low selectivity to carbon oxides and higher selectivity to ethylene.

Regarding the effectiveness of different catalysts in activating CO2 for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane, the role of traditional oxidants and CO2, and the proposed mechanisms and energy barriers for CO2 dissociation, the provided literature does not contain specific information about these aspects. Therefore, a comparison of V2O5, VOx/SiO2, CeO2, and transition metal clusters in terms of CO2 activation cannot be made based on the given information.

The literature does not directly compare redox-active and redox-inactive metal oxide catalysts for oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of alkanes. However, it provides insights into the mechanism for vanadium-based catalysts, which are redox-active:

          1. C-H bond activation: For vanadia-based catalysts, the ODH of propane proceeds via a Mars-van Krevelen mechanism. Propane removes lattice oxygen from VOx species, producing propene, water, and reduced VOx.

          2. Catalyst regeneration: After C-H activation, gas-phase oxygen (O2 or N2O) replenishes the lattice oxygen in a re-oxidation step. The rate of this re-oxidation affects the overall catalytic performance.

          3. Role of oxidants: N2O re-oxidizes reduced VOx sites more slowly than O2, resulting in a lower concentration and density of active lattice oxygen. This leads to higher propene selectivity with N2O compared to O2.

          4. Selectivity considerations: The formation of COx requires several oxygen species, while C3H6 formation requires fewer. Therefore, lower densities/concentrations of active oxygen species favor propene formation over COx formation.

          The document does not provide information on redox-inactive catalysts, CO2 as an oxidant, or the effectiveness of other catalysts like CeO2 and transition metal clusters in activating CO2 for ODP. Therefore, a comprehensive comparison of these aspects cannot be made based on the given literature.

The mechanisms of C-H bond activation and catalyst regeneration in oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes differ between redox-active and redox-inactive metal oxide catalysts:

For redox-active oxides:
- C-H activation occurs homolytically via H abstraction by surface oxygen species.
- A Mars-van Krevelen (MvK) mechanism is common, where hydrogen forms a hydroxide and abstracts a second hydrogen.
- Water desorbs, leaving an oxygen vacancy that must be filled by an oxidant to regenerate the catalyst.

For redox-inactive oxides:
- C-H activation occurs heterolytically over an acid-base pair.
- No oxygen vacancy formation is required.
- The catalyst surface brings together hydrogen and the oxidant, which is reduced directly.

Regarding the role of traditional oxidants and CO2:
- Traditional oxidants like O2 can easily fill oxygen vacancies in redox-active oxides.
- When CO2 is used as an oxidant, two main mechanisms are proposed:
  1. Direct CO2 dissociation to CO and O
  2. CO2 hydrogenation to HOCO or COOH before forming CO

The effectiveness of different catalysts in activating CO2 for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane varies:

1. V2O5: Very ineffective, with a high barrier of 3.16 eV for CO2 oxidation of VIII sites.
2. VOx/SiO2: Moderately effective, with a lower but still significant barrier of 1.76 eV.
3. CeO2: More effective, especially on surfaces with oxygen vacancies, with a barrier of 1.36 eV.
4. Transition metal clusters (e.g., Ni4/MgO): Highly effective, with a low barrier of 0.35 eV for CO2 dissociation.

The effectiveness of these catalysts in activating CO2 follows the order: Ni4/MgO > CeO2 > VOx/SiO2 > V2O5. This trend is based on the energy barriers for CO2 dissociation or activation, which is the proposed mechanism for CO2 utilization in these systems.

The mechanisms of C-H bond activation and catalyst regeneration in oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of alkanes differ between redox-active and redox-inactive metal oxide catalysts. For redox-active catalysts, the Mars-van Krevelen mechanism is typically involved, where lattice oxygen participates in the reaction. When using CO2 as an oxidant, the mechanism involves a two-step process: first, the catalyst dehydrogenates the alkane (e.g., ethane to ethylene), producing H2; then, H2 reduces CO2 to CO through the reverse water-gas shift reaction, regenerating the catalyst and producing water as a byproduct.

Catalyst effectiveness varies:
1. Mo2C-based catalysts show promise for ethylene production but suffer from deactivation due to the formation of an oxycarbide phase. Adding small amounts of H2 to the feed can help mitigate deactivation.
2. Pt-based catalysts, particularly Pt/CeO2, are more effective for producing synthesis gas through reforming rather than ODH. CeO2-based materials show high activity toward CO2 activation.

Energy barriers for CO2 dissociation and C-H bond activation differ among catalysts. On Pt/CeO2, CO2 has a lower activation barrier compared to ethane, while on Mo2C/γ-Al2O3, the trend is reversed. These differences contribute to varying product selectivities.

Traditional oxidants like O2 are not explicitly compared to CO2 in the given information. However, CO2 is described as a "mild oxidant," suggesting it may be less aggressive than O2 in oxidation reactions.

The mechanisms of C-H bond activation and catalyst regeneration differ between redox-active and redox-inactive metal oxide catalysts in oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of alkanes.

For redox-active catalysts like V2O5 or VOx/SiO2, the Mars-van Krevelen mechanism typically operates. This involves lattice oxygen participating in C-H bond activation, followed by catalyst re-oxidation by gas-phase oxygen. The catalyst undergoes redox cycles during the reaction.

In contrast, redox-inactive catalysts like CeO2 cannot easily change oxidation states. They likely activate C-H bonds through surface oxygen species or defect sites. Regeneration occurs through gas-phase oxygen replenishing surface oxygen rather than redox cycling of the metal.

When using CO2 instead of O2 as the oxidant, the mechanisms change. CO2 acts as a softer oxidant that can avoid deep oxidation of products. It participates in the reverse water-gas shift reaction, which favors alkane conversion.

Different catalysts show varying effectiveness in activating CO2 for propane ODH:

- CeO2 is considered highly promising due to its ability to directly cleave the C=O bond in CO2.
- Fe-Ni bimetallic catalysts on CeO2 favor C-H bond activation.
- Pt-containing bimetallic catalysts tend to promote C-C cleavage instead.

The effectiveness depends on the catalyst's ability to lower energy barriers for CO2 dissociation and subsequent ODH steps. CeO2-based catalysts, especially when doped with transition metals like Fe, show good potential for CO2 activation and selective ODH of propane.

The bimetallic composition can be tuned to balance competitive pathways like ODH, reverse water-gas shift, and dry reforming to optimize olefin selectivity. Overall, CO2-assisted ODH over metal-doped CeO2 catalysts offers a promising approach by combining the benefits of CO2 as a soft oxidant with tunable C-H activation properties of transition metals and the CO2 activation ability of CeO2.

The mechanisms of C-H bond activation and catalyst regeneration differ between redox-active and redox-inactive metal oxide catalysts in the oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of alkanes.

For redox-active catalysts like V2O5 and VOx/SiO2, the Mars-Van Krevelen mechanism is generally accepted. In this mechanism, lattice oxygen from the metal oxide participates in C-H bond activation, forming water and reducing the metal oxide. The catalyst is then regenerated by re-oxidation with an oxidant.

Traditional oxidants like O2 can fully re-oxidize these catalysts, but CO2 acts as a milder oxidant. For vanadium-based catalysts, CO2 can oxidize V2O3 to V2O4, but not to V2O5. This partial re-oxidation leads to higher selectivity towards propylene and reduced carbon formation compared to using O2.

For redox-inactive catalysts like CeO2, the mechanism likely involves surface-adsorbed oxygen species rather than lattice oxygen. These catalysts may activate CO2 differently, potentially through the formation of carbonate species on the surface.

The effectiveness of different catalysts in activating CO2 for ODH of propane varies:

1. Vanadium-based catalysts (V2O5, VOx/SiO2) show good activity, with CO2 re-oxidizing the partially reduced metal oxide.
2. Chromium-based catalysts also demonstrate the ability to be re-oxidized by CO2.
3. Gallium and indium-based catalysts utilize CO2 differently, promoting coke removal and participating in the reverse water gas shift reaction.
4. Transition metal clusters may activate CO2 through different mechanisms, but specific information is not provided in the given text.

DFT calculations for VOx/SiO2 catalysts suggest that the rate-limiting step is the activation of the secondary C-H bond of propane (activation energy of 158 kJ/mol), while the re-oxidation of the catalyst with CO2 is faster. This implies that CO2 activation is not the limiting factor for this particular catalyst system.

In summary, the effectiveness of catalysts in activating CO2 for ODH of propane depends on their ability to facilitate CO2 dissociation and incorporate the resulting oxygen into the catalyst structure or reaction mechanism. The specific mechanisms and energy barriers vary among different catalyst types, with redox-active metal oxides showing promising results in CO2-assisted ODH of propane.

The mechanisms of C-H bond activation and catalyst regeneration differ between redox-active and redox-inactive metal oxide catalysts in the oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes. 

For redox-active catalysts like V2O5 and Cr2O3, the mechanism typically involves lattice oxygen participating in C-H bond activation, forming the alkene and reduced metal sites. These reduced sites are then re-oxidized by the oxidant. Traditional oxidants like O2 can directly re-oxidize the catalyst, decreasing reaction temperatures effectively. CO2 acts as a milder oxidant that helps maintain higher oxidation states of the metal species.

Redox-inactive catalysts like CeO2 generally activate C-H bonds through acid-base interactions rather than redox processes. Their regeneration does not involve changes in metal oxidation states.

The role of CO2 in oxidative dehydrogenation appears to be multifaceted:
1. Maintaining higher oxidation states of the catalyst, particularly for V2O5 and Cr2O3.
2. Removing hydrogen from products via the reverse water-gas shift reaction (CO2 + H2 → CO + H2O).
3. Eliminating deposited carbon through the reverse Boudouard reaction (CO2 + C → 2CO).

These mechanisms could help shift the equilibrium towards product formation and prevent catalyst deactivation due to coking.

Regarding catalyst effectiveness, oxidized diamond-supported Cr2O3 and V2O5 catalysts showed promising results for propane dehydrogenation in the presence of CO2. However, the literature does not provide direct comparisons to VOx/SiO2, CeO2, or transition metal clusters for CO2 activation.

The mechanisms for CO2 dissociation are not explicitly discussed, and the energy barriers for this process are not provided in the given text. More detailed mechanistic studies and comparisons to other catalyst systems would be needed to fully address the effectiveness of different catalysts in activating CO2 for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane.

The mechanisms of C-H bond activation and catalyst regeneration in oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of alkanes differ between redox-active and redox-inactive metal oxide catalysts. 

For redox-active catalysts like NiMo/Al2O3, the Mars-van Krevelen mechanism is typically followed. This involves the abstraction of hydrogen from the alkane by lattice oxygen (e.g., O-Mo species), followed by catalyst reoxidation by gas-phase oxidants. The process involves:
1. Transfer of hydrogens to surface oxygen species (e.g., O-Mo)
2. Formation of water molecules
3. Desorption of water, creating oxygen vacancies
4. Replenishment of vacancies with oxygen from gaseous oxidants (O2, N2O, or CO2)

Redox-inactive catalysts operate through different mechanisms, often involving the formation of active oxygen species on the catalyst surface.

Traditional oxidants like O2 are highly reactive but can lead to over-oxidation and lower selectivity. CO2 and N2O, considered "soft oxidants," offer improved selectivity by limiting the formation of electrophilic oxygen species that promote total oxidation. This results in higher selectivity towards desired products like butadiene.

The effectiveness of catalysts in activating CO2 for ODH varies. While specific information on V2O5, VOx/SiO2, CeO2, or transition metal clusters is not provided, the general principle is that catalysts capable of efficiently dissociating CO2 and creating active oxygen species without over-oxidizing the surface are considered more effective for CO2-assisted ODH reactions.

The mechanisms of C-H bond activation and catalyst regeneration differ between redox-active and redox-inactive metal oxide catalysts in oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of alkanes. CO2 acts as a milder oxidant compared to traditional oxidants like O2, suppressing over-oxidation and minimizing carbon oxide production.

For CO2-ODHP, bimetallic catalysts supported on CeO2 show promise:
1. Fe3Ni/CeO2 favors C-H bond activation for the ODH pathway, promoting propylene production.
2. Ni3Pt/CeO2 favors C-C bond cleavage, leading to dry reforming of propane.

The effectiveness of catalysts in activating CO2 varies:
- CeO2 support can store/release oxygen, potentially facilitating CO2 activation and providing lattice oxygen for coke suppression.
- Fe3Ni surfaces likely dissociate CO2 to provide oxygen for the ODH reaction.
- The FeO/Ni interface facilitates selective C-H bond scission.
- Pt-terminated Ni3Pt surfaces promote C-C bond cleavage for dry reforming.

CO2 also enhances propane conversion by consuming H2 through the reverse water-gas shift reaction. While specific energy barriers for CO2 dissociation are not provided, the catalyst surface composition significantly influences the activation pathway and energy barriers for CO2-mediated reactions.

The mechanism of C-H bond activation and catalyst regeneration in oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of alkanes over redox-active metal oxide catalysts, such as vanadium and molybdenum oxides, follows the Mars-van Krevelen redox mechanism. The process involves:

1. C-H bond activation: Ethane adsorbs to a surface or lattice oxygen atom, followed by C-H bond cleavage to form an ethoxy intermediate and a hydroxyl group on the catalyst surface. This step is considered rate-limiting.

2. Catalyst reduction: As the reaction proceeds, the catalyst surface is reduced as lattice oxygen atoms activate alkane molecules to form olefins.

3. Catalyst regeneration: Gas-phase oxygen adsorbs to the vacancies created on the catalyst surface and reoxidizes the active sites.

The choice of oxidant significantly affects the catalyst's oxidation state and performance:

1. O2 as oxidant: The catalyst remains fully oxidized, and increasing O2 concentration does not affect the ethylene formation rate. The molybdenum catalyst stays in the Mo(VI) state.

2. N2O as oxidant: The catalyst operates in a more reduced state, with a mixture of Mo(VI), Mo(V), and Mo(IV). Increasing N2O concentration increases the rate of catalyst re-oxidation. The activation energy for re-oxidation with N2O is 2.4 times higher than with O2, making the re-oxidation step kinetically relevant.

The use of N2O allows the catalyst to operate in a more reduced state, which can improve selectivity to desired olefin products. However, O2 can oxidize the reduced catalyst at lower temperatures due to its lower activation energy for re-oxidation.

The provided information does not discuss redox-inactive catalysts, the use of CO2 as an oxidant, or the effectiveness of different catalysts (V2O5, VOx/SiO2, CeO2, and transition metal clusters) in activating CO2 for propane ODH. Therefore, these aspects of the question cannot be addressed based on the given information.

The mechanisms of C-H bond activation and catalyst regeneration in oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of alkanes differ significantly between redox-active and redox-inactive metal oxide catalysts:

Redox-active catalysts (e.g., Cr, V, Co oxides):
- Operate through a Mars-van Krevelen mechanism
- Donate lattice oxygen for C-H bond activation, forming alkenes and reducing the metal center
- Regenerate by reoxidation with CO2, filling the oxygen vacancy

Redox-inactive catalysts (e.g., Ga oxides):
- Operate through heterolytic dissociation of alkanes and separate CO2 activation
- Do not involve changes in metal oxidation state

CO2 serves as a milder oxidant compared to O2, which can lead to over-oxidation. CO2 can also modify catalyst surfaces, influencing activity and selectivity.

Effectiveness of different catalysts in activating CO2 for ODH of propane:

1. V2O5 and supported VOx catalysts:
   - Can follow one-step ODH or two-step pathway with RWGS reaction
   - Operate primarily through Mars-van Krevelen mechanism
   - Support participation can improve alkene selectivity (e.g., V2O5/CeO2-ZrO2)

2. CeO2-based catalysts:
   - Facilitate CO2 dissociation, generating reactive oxygen species
   - Enhance CO2 activation due to oxygen storage capacity and oxygen vacancies
   - Improve performance when used as a support (e.g., Ni-CeO2 interfaces)

3. Cr oxide catalysts:
   - High initial activity but suffer from low selectivity and rapid deactivation due to coking
   - CO2 activation attributed to isolated Cr(VI) centers generated from Cr(III) in a redox cycle

4. Transition metal clusters:
   - Bimetallic systems (e.g., Fe-Ni) show promise in CO2 activation and selective C-H bond cleavage
   - FeOx/Ni(111) interfaces promote C-H cleavage over C-C scission

The effectiveness of these catalysts depends on their ability to activate both CO2 and the alkane substrate while maintaining selectivity towards the desired alkene product. Energy barriers for CO2 dissociation vary among catalysts, with CeO2-based systems generally showing lower barriers compared to other oxide supports.

The mechanisms of C-H bond activation and catalyst regeneration in oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of alkanes are primarily discussed for redox-active VOx catalysts, with a comparison between O2 and N2O as oxidants:

1. C-H bond activation:
   - The breaking of the weakest C-H bond in the alkane molecule is the rate-limiting step in ODH reactions.
   - This step occurs on the catalyst surface and is independent of the oxidant used.
   - The reactivity of alkanes increases as the strength of the weakest C-H bond decreases, following the order C2H6 < C3H8 < n-C4H10 < iso-C4H10.

2. Catalyst regeneration:
   - Follows a Mars-van Krevelen mechanism for both O2 and N2O oxidants.
   - Reduced VOx species are reoxidized by the oxidant, restoring lattice oxygen.
   - With O2: Forms peroxo species on reduced VOx, which then transform to lattice oxygen.
   - With N2O: Directly restores lattice oxygen without forming peroxo intermediates.

3. Oxidant comparison (O2 vs N2O):
   - N2O shows superior performance in terms of olefin selectivity.
   - N2O suppresses COx formation more effectively than O2.
   - O2 forms additional reactive oxygen species (possibly bi-atomic) that contribute to non-selective oxidation, while N2O does not form these species.

The literature does not discuss redox-inactive catalysts or the use of CO2 as an oxidant. It also does not provide information on other catalysts like V2O5, VOx/SiO2, CeO2, or transition metal clusters for CO2 activation in propane ODH.

The mechanisms of C-H bond activation and catalyst regeneration differ significantly between redox-active and redox-inactive metal oxide catalysts in the oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes.

For redox-active catalysts like traditional vanadium and molybdenum-based metal oxides, the reaction follows a redox mechanism. The rate-limiting step is the oxidation of propane by surface lattice oxygen from the transition metal oxides. This process involves the transfer of oxygen from the catalyst to the reactant, followed by the regeneration of the catalyst through re-oxidation.

In contrast, redox-inactive catalysts like hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) operate through a different mechanism. These catalysts have poor redox ability and cannot easily transfer oxygen from their lattice to the reactants. Instead, they catalyze the reaction through heterolytic C-H cleavage, followed by a reduction of the gas-phase oxidant rather than the surface.

The difference in mechanisms leads to distinct product distributions. Redox-active catalysts tend to produce more carbon oxides (COx) as by-products, while redox-inactive catalysts like h-BN show very low selectivity to carbon oxides and higher selectivity to ethylene.

Regarding the effectiveness of different catalysts in activating CO2 for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane, the role of traditional oxidants and CO2, and the proposed mechanisms and energy barriers for CO2 dissociation, the provided literature does not contain specific information about these aspects. Therefore, a comparison of V2O5, VOx/SiO2, CeO2, and transition metal clusters in terms of CO2 activation cannot be made based on the given information.

The literature does not directly compare redox-active and redox-inactive metal oxide catalysts for oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of alkanes. However, it provides insights into the mechanism for vanadium-based catalysts, which are redox-active:

          1. C-H bond activation: For vanadia-based catalysts, the ODH of propane proceeds via a Mars-van Krevelen mechanism. Propane removes lattice oxygen from VOx species, producing propene, water, and reduced VOx.

          2. Catalyst regeneration: After C-H activation, gas-phase oxygen (O2 or N2O) replenishes the lattice oxygen in a re-oxidation step. The rate of this re-oxidation affects the overall catalytic performance.

          3. Role of oxidants: N2O re-oxidizes reduced VOx sites more slowly than O2, resulting in a lower concentration and density of active lattice oxygen. This leads to higher propene selectivity with N2O compared to O2.

          4. Selectivity considerations: The formation of COx requires several oxygen species, while C3H6 formation requires fewer. Therefore, lower densities/concentrations of active oxygen species favor propene formation over COx formation.

          The document does not provide information on redox-inactive catalysts, CO2 as an oxidant, or the effectiveness of other catalysts like CeO2 and transition metal clusters in activating CO2 for ODP. Therefore, a comprehensive comparison of these aspects cannot be made based on the given literature.

The mechanisms of C-H bond activation and catalyst regeneration in oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes differ between redox-active and redox-inactive metal oxide catalysts:

For redox-active oxides:
- C-H activation occurs homolytically via H abstraction by surface oxygen species.
- A Mars-van Krevelen (MvK) mechanism is common, where hydrogen forms a hydroxide and abstracts a second hydrogen.
- Water desorbs, leaving an oxygen vacancy that must be filled by an oxidant to regenerate the catalyst.

For redox-inactive oxides:
- C-H activation occurs heterolytically over an acid-base pair.
- No oxygen vacancy formation is required.
- The catalyst surface brings together hydrogen and the oxidant, which is reduced directly.

Regarding the role of traditional oxidants and CO2:
- Traditional oxidants like O2 can easily fill oxygen vacancies in redox-active oxides.
- When CO2 is used as an oxidant, two main mechanisms are proposed:
  1. Direct CO2 dissociation to CO and O
  2. CO2 hydrogenation to HOCO or COOH before forming CO

The effectiveness of different catalysts in activating CO2 for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane varies:

1. V2O5: Very ineffective, with a high barrier of 3.16 eV for CO2 oxidation of VIII sites.
2. VOx/SiO2: Moderately effective, with a lower but still significant barrier of 1.76 eV.
3. CeO2: More effective, especially on surfaces with oxygen vacancies, with a barrier of 1.36 eV.
4. Transition metal clusters (e.g., Ni4/MgO): Highly effective, with a low barrier of 0.35 eV for CO2 dissociation.

The effectiveness of these catalysts in activating CO2 follows the order: Ni4/MgO > CeO2 > VOx/SiO2 > V2O5. This trend is based on the energy barriers for CO2 dissociation or activation, which is the proposed mechanism for CO2 utilization in these systems.

The mechanisms of C-H bond activation and catalyst regeneration in oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of alkanes differ between redox-active and redox-inactive metal oxide catalysts. For redox-active catalysts, the Mars-van Krevelen mechanism is typically involved, where lattice oxygen participates in the reaction. When using CO2 as an oxidant, the mechanism involves a two-step process: first, the catalyst dehydrogenates the alkane (e.g., ethane to ethylene), producing H2; then, H2 reduces CO2 to CO through the reverse water-gas shift reaction, regenerating the catalyst and producing water as a byproduct.

Catalyst effectiveness varies:
1. Mo2C-based catalysts show promise for ethylene production but suffer from deactivation due to the formation of an oxycarbide phase. Adding small amounts of H2 to the feed can help mitigate deactivation.
2. Pt-based catalysts, particularly Pt/CeO2, are more effective for producing synthesis gas through reforming rather than ODH. CeO2-based materials show high activity toward CO2 activation.

Energy barriers for CO2 dissociation and C-H bond activation differ among catalysts. On Pt/CeO2, CO2 has a lower activation barrier compared to ethane, while on Mo2C/γ-Al2O3, the trend is reversed. These differences contribute to varying product selectivities.

Traditional oxidants like O2 are not explicitly compared to CO2 in the given information. However, CO2 is described as a "mild oxidant," suggesting it may be less aggressive than O2 in oxidation reactions.

The mechanisms of C-H bond activation and catalyst regeneration differ between redox-active and redox-inactive metal oxide catalysts in oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of alkanes.

For redox-active catalysts like V2O5 or VOx/SiO2, the Mars-van Krevelen mechanism typically operates. This involves lattice oxygen participating in C-H bond activation, followed by catalyst re-oxidation by gas-phase oxygen. The catalyst undergoes redox cycles during the reaction.

In contrast, redox-inactive catalysts like CeO2 cannot easily change oxidation states. They likely activate C-H bonds through surface oxygen species or defect sites. Regeneration occurs through gas-phase oxygen replenishing surface oxygen rather than redox cycling of the metal.

When using CO2 instead of O2 as the oxidant, the mechanisms change. CO2 acts as a softer oxidant that can avoid deep oxidation of products. It participates in the reverse water-gas shift reaction, which favors alkane conversion.

Different catalysts show varying effectiveness in activating CO2 for propane ODH:

- CeO2 is considered highly promising due to its ability to directly cleave the C=O bond in CO2.
- Fe-Ni bimetallic catalysts on CeO2 favor C-H bond activation.
- Pt-containing bimetallic catalysts tend to promote C-C cleavage instead.

The effectiveness depends on the catalyst's ability to lower energy barriers for CO2 dissociation and subsequent ODH steps. CeO2-based catalysts, especially when doped with transition metals like Fe, show good potential for CO2 activation and selective ODH of propane.

The bimetallic composition can be tuned to balance competitive pathways like ODH, reverse water-gas shift, and dry reforming to optimize olefin selectivity. Overall, CO2-assisted ODH over metal-doped CeO2 catalysts offers a promising approach by combining the benefits of CO2 as a soft oxidant with tunable C-H activation properties of transition metals and the CO2 activation ability of CeO2.

The mechanisms of C-H bond activation and catalyst regeneration differ between redox-active and redox-inactive metal oxide catalysts in the oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of alkanes.

For redox-active catalysts like V2O5 and VOx/SiO2, the Mars-Van Krevelen mechanism is generally accepted. In this mechanism, lattice oxygen from the metal oxide participates in C-H bond activation, forming water and reducing the metal oxide. The catalyst is then regenerated by re-oxidation with an oxidant.

Traditional oxidants like O2 can fully re-oxidize these catalysts, but CO2 acts as a milder oxidant. For vanadium-based catalysts, CO2 can oxidize V2O3 to V2O4, but not to V2O5. This partial re-oxidation leads to higher selectivity towards propylene and reduced carbon formation compared to using O2.

For redox-inactive catalysts like CeO2, the mechanism likely involves surface-adsorbed oxygen species rather than lattice oxygen. These catalysts may activate CO2 differently, potentially through the formation of carbonate species on the surface.

The effectiveness of different catalysts in activating CO2 for ODH of propane varies:

1. Vanadium-based catalysts (V2O5, VOx/SiO2) show good activity, with CO2 re-oxidizing the partially reduced metal oxide.
2. Chromium-based catalysts also demonstrate the ability to be re-oxidized by CO2.
3. Gallium and indium-based catalysts utilize CO2 differently, promoting coke removal and participating in the reverse water gas shift reaction.
4. Transition metal clusters may activate CO2 through different mechanisms, but specific information is not provided in the given text.

DFT calculations for VOx/SiO2 catalysts suggest that the rate-limiting step is the activation of the secondary C-H bond of propane (activation energy of 158 kJ/mol), while the re-oxidation of the catalyst with CO2 is faster. This implies that CO2 activation is not the limiting factor for this particular catalyst system.

In summary, the effectiveness of catalysts in activating CO2 for ODH of propane depends on their ability to facilitate CO2 dissociation and incorporate the resulting oxygen into the catalyst structure or reaction mechanism. The specific mechanisms and energy barriers vary among different catalyst types, with redox-active metal oxides showing promising results in CO2-assisted ODH of propane.
