[2] "The following oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes using oxygen as an oxidant of alkanes has been proposed as effective in decreasing reaction temperature."

[3] "Recently, several attempts were made to use carbon dioxide as an oxidant for the coupling of methane [1113], and the dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene [1418], iso-propylbenzene [19], propane [20,21], or iso-butane [22]."

[4] "UV-Vis analyses of the fresh and the reacted catalysts in the presence and absence of CO2 revealed that CO2 kept the surface V2O5 and Cr2O3 in a state of oxidation slightly higher than that in the absence of CO2."

[5] "We propose that maintenance of the higher oxidation state of chromium and vanadium species might be one of the important factors for high catalytic activities in the dehydrogenation of alkane in the presence of CO2."

[6] "In dehydrogenation under a CO2 atmosphere, the roles of CO2 would be considered as follows:
CO2 + H2 → CO + H2O
CO2 + C → 2CO"

"The oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of n-butane to butene and 1,3-butadiene follows the Marsvan Krevelen mechanism, as also reported by several researchers"

"Selective oxidation of butane to butenes and, ultimately, butadiene proceeds with the transfer of hydrogens to O-Mo species on the catalyst. Total oxidation proceeds on fully oxygen-terminated surface via O-Ni species and yields cracked products and COx."

"As typical for Mars van Krevelen mechanism, surface oxygen species (O-Mo and O-Ni) are recovered via recombination with two hydrogen atoms to water molecule, its desorption and the replenishment of the ensuing vacancy with oxygen from gaseous oxidant (O2, N2O, or CO2)."

"CO2 and N2O have been reported as soft oxidants for ODH of light alkanes"

"Using soft oxidants like N2O and CO2 limits the formation of electrophilic oxygen species, which promote the oxidation of alkenes to carbon oxides, on the surface of the catalyst, thereby increasing the selectivity towards butadiene."

"Unlike regular oxidative dehydrogenation with molecular oxygen, CO2 as a mild oxidant suppresses over-oxidation and thus minimizes the production of carbon oxides."

"The presence of CO2 can also increase the equilibrium conversion of propane by consuming H2 through the reverse water gas shift reaction (RWGS)"

"Non-precious FeNi and precious NiPt catalysts supported on CeO2 have been identified as promising catalysts for CO2-ODHP and dry reforming, respectively, in flow reactor studies conducted at 823 K."

"The DFT calculation results indicate that the bulk Fe3Ni(111) surface and the FeO/Ni(111) interface should favor CH bond scission for the CO2-ODHP pathway, whereas the Pt-terminated Ni3Pt(111) surface should favor the CC bond cleavage for the DRP pathway."

"Ceria (CeO2) is a good choice of oxide support because it has the ability to store/release oxygen and thus may induce direct CO bond scission of CO2, while also providing available lattice oxygen for coke suppression"

"It is widely accepted that the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane over easily reducible transition metal oxides proceeds via a Mars–van Krevelen redox mechanism."

"Ethane must first adsorb (reaction 1) to a surface or lattice oxygen atom (O*), and a C–H bond must be cleaved forming an ethoxy intermediate and a hydroxyl group on the catalyst surface (reaction 2). This initial cleavage of the ethane C–H bond is considered the rate-limiting step"

"Gas-phase oxygen must then adsorb to a vacancy and reoxidize the active site (reaction 5)."

"Argyle et al. (4) have suggested that during ethane ODH on vanadium catalysts, the catalyst surface is reduced as lattice oxygen atoms activate ethane molecules, ultimately forming olefins."

"When using O2 as the oxidant, increasing the O2 concentration does not lead to an increase in ethylene formation rate because the molybdenum is already fully oxidized. When using N2O as the oxidant, however, an increase in concentration of N2O will increase the rate of catalyst re-oxidation."

"The use of N2O as oxidant makes the activation energy of re-oxidation much closer to the apparent ODH activation energy, which suggests that the rates of catalyst re-oxidation and reduction will be much closer when using N2O as oxidant."

"The XPS results indicate that molybdenum is in a lower oxidation state in the post-N2O oxidative dehydrogenation sample. The post-N2O sample contained Mo(VI), Mo(V), and Mo(IV), whereas the post-O2 sample appeared fully oxidized with only Mo(VI) appearing."

"The activation energy of re-oxidation when using N2O is 2.4 times higher than that required when using O2. This difference likely accounts for the ability of O2 to oxidize the reduced sample at lower temperatures than N2O."

"The most prevalent catalysts for CO2-ODH of light alkanes are oxides3,24,28 of Cr (refs2931), V (refs3234), Ga(refs35,36) and, to a lesser extent, In (refs37,38) and Co (refs3941)."

"The catalytic activity of transition-metal oxides is typically attributed to their redox activity, which is necessary to effect O atom transfers."

"To complete this redox-type Marsvan Krevelen mechanism, the metal centre undergoes oxidation by CO2 to fill the lattice O vacancy49"

"Ga oxide catalysts for the CO2-ODH differ from those described above because the former are typically not redox-active over the relevant potential range and the catalysts operate through heterolytic dissociation of the alkane and activation of CO2"

"DFT calculations and isotopic labelling experiments on the CO2-ODH of alkanes over (supported or unsupported) V-based catalysts indicate that both a one-step oxidative dehydrogenation pathway or a two-step pathway with the RWGS reaction are possible66,67."

"The majority of V-based catalysts operate through a Marsvan Krevelen mechanism68, a greater participation of O atoms from the support improves alkene selectivity, as observed for V2O5/CeO2ZrO2 in the CO2-ODH of C4H10"

"CeO2 helps enable facile CO2 dissociation to give a *O species that participates in C2H6 activation on the Ni particles at the NiCeO2 interfaces."

"Cr oxide catalysts for the CO2-ODH can give high C2H6 conversions even after short reaction times, but the selectivity for CO2 conversion is low and the catalysts have short life cycles because they are unstable towards coking52."

"The activation of CO2 over CrOx dispersed in MCM-41 has been attributed to isolated Crvi centres generated from Criii in a redox cycle5559"

"DFT calculations of the oxidative dehydrogenation and reforming pathways on Ni(111) and FeOx/Ni(111) surfaces predict that Ni(111) should favour CC scission, while FeOx/Ni(111) could promote CH cleavage."

"Irrespective of the alkane and the oxidant applied, the overall rate of alkane conversion increases with a decrease in the strength of the weakest CH bond in the alkane molecule indicating that alkane activation is the rate-limiting step."

"Alkanes react with oxidized VOx species yielding reduced ones. The reduced VOx species are reoxidized by N2O resulting in gas-phase N2 and restoring lattice oxygen species."

"TAP results, and SSITKA data consistent with Mar-van-Krevelen mechanism, where selective, and non-selective reactions occur on lattice oxygen of VOx species. This is valid for O2- and N2O-containing feeds."

"Recent DFT calculations of interaction of O2 and N2O with reduced and oxidized VOx species suggest that peroxo species are formed upon interaction of O2 but not N2O with reduced VOx species [26]. These bi-atomic oxygen species are further transformed to lattice oxygen ones. The latter species are also formed upon reoxidation of reduced VOx species by N2O."

"For both oxidants, the initial rate of alkane conversion follows the order: C2H6<C3H8<n-C4H10<iso-C4H10. It is important to highlight that the same order is also valid for the strength of the weakest CH bond in these alkanes [15,16]. Considering both experimental facts, it is suggested that the breaking of the weakest CH bond limits the ODH reaction over highly dispersed VOx species independent of the oxidant applied."

[1] "Generally, the ODHP reaction catalyzed by transition metal oxide catalysts was demonstrated to follow the redox mechanism, in which the oxidation of propane by surface lattice oxygen of transitional metal oxides is the rate-limiting step."

[2] "Different from the traditional vanadium and molybdenum-based redox metal oxide catalysts in ODHP reaction, h-BN shows very low selectivity to carbon oxides and relatively high selectivity to ethylene, compared to V-based catalysts where the main by-products are COx."

[3] "The high thermodynamic (and kinetic) unfavorability of the subsequent CH activation by the BOB oxygen is explained by poor redox ability of the surface, which differs from conventional ODHP catalysts such as vanadia and other transition-metal oxides."

[4] "Instead, we have found the redox-poor surface catalyzes the reaction by heterolytic CH cleavage followed by a reduction of the gas phase oxidant rather than the surface."

"It is commonly accepted that the ODP reaction over vanadia-based catalysts proceeds via a Mars–van Krevelen mechanism. This mechanism suggests that C3H8 removes lattice oxygen from VOx species, yielding C3H6, H2O, and a reduced VOx center (Eq. (3)). Subsequently, the lattice oxygen is replenished by gas-phase oxygen in a re-oxidation step (Eq. (4))."

          "Since the rate of catalyst re-oxidation by N2O is slower than that by O2, a lower steady-state concentration of lattice oxygen is expected to be responsible for C3H8 activation in the presence of N2O."

          "From the stoichiometric requirements of the ODP reaction it is postulated that one selective catalyst site should contain one to two active lattice-oxygen anions to obtain the desired propene. Active sites with more than two active lattice oxygen anions would favor the formation of waste products (i.e., CO and CO2) by consecutive total oxidation steps."

[1] "In metal oxides, this commonly occurs homolytically via H abstraction by surface oxygen species, or heterolytically over an acidbase pair. (266268) In the redox-active oxides, a MvK mechanism is commonly observed where the hydrogen, adsorbed on an oxygen forms a hydroxide, and abstracts a second hydrogen either from a CH bond or a neighboring hydroxyl group. (269) This forms water, which desorbs and leaves behind an oxygen vacancy that must be filled by an oxidant to regenerate the catalyst. (270272)"

[2] "In an alternative mechanism, the formation of the vacancy is not required and instead, the catalyst surface brings together the hydrogen and the oxidant, which is reduced directly. This is more commonly observed in redox-inactive oxides, such as MgO and La2O3, as reported from theoretical studies. (273275)"

[3] "When CO2 is used as an oxidant, there are generally two proposed mechanisms for its participation in ODHP. One involves direct CO2 dissociation to form CO and O, and the other involves the hydrogenation of CO2 to HOCO or COOH before forming CO."

[4] "Fan et al. have explored the feasibility of ethylbenzene dehydrogenation with CO2 on a V2O5 catalyst. (276) They found the barrier for CO2 to oxidize the VIII site is 3.16 eV, with an endothermic reaction energy of 2.21 eV, suggesting an extremely difficult process."

[5] "Meanwhile, on a VOx/SiO2 catalyst, Ascoop et al. find that CO2 reoxidizes the site with a barrier of 1.76 eV, which is lower than on the pure V2O5 surface but still significant in energy. (28)"

[6] "In contrast, CO2 dissociation can occur more easily on the CeO2 (110) surface with a rate-limiting barrier of 1.36 eV on a site containing oxygen vacancies. (277)"

[7] "One study found a low CO2 dissociation barrier of 0.35 eV could be obtained on Ni4/MgO which provides active oxygen species for alkane CH activation. (281)"

"ODH of ethane with CO2 as a mild oxidant is proposed to occur through a Mars-van-Krevelen-type mechanism, where the catalyst first dehydrogenates ethane into ethylene and H2, then H2 reduces CO2 to CO through the reverse water-gas shift (RWGS) reaction, producing H2O as a byproduct."

"To help mitigate the high deactivation over Mo2C/γ-Al2O3, a small amount of H2 (5vol%) was added to the reaction feed to remove inactive oxide species to complete the catalytic cycle and restore some of the active carbidic phase, leading to higher activity"

"Treatment in pure CO2, however, completely oxidizes Mo2C. Therefore, the adsorbed O from CO2 is necessary to form an oxycarbide phase, which dehydrogenates ethane, but also likely contributes, at least partially, to the deactivation seen over Mo2C-based catalysts."

"DFT was also used to calculate the enthalpy change for the oxidative CC and CH bond cleavage of ethane on Pt(111) and Mo2C(001) surfaces."

"The lower activation barrier of CO2 over Pt/CeO2 confirms the relatively high activity of CeO2-based materials toward CO2."

"Pt/CeO2 shows higher activity and selectivity toward reforming products, but Mo2C/γ-Al2O3 has a lower activity with increased ethylene selectivity"

"The use of CO2 as, alternative to oxygen, soft oxidant has the potential to i) avoid deep oxidation of alkanes/alkenes, ii) reduce coke formation and iii) favor propane conversion due to participation of the produced hydrogen in the reverse water-gas shift reaction (RWGS)."

"Pioneering work by the research group of JG Chen has provided molecular level understanding on light alkane CO2 assisted ODH over non-precious metal (Fe-Ni) and precious metal (Fe-Pt, Ni-Pt) over CeO2"

"DFT calculations suggested that Fe-Ni surface favors C-H bond scissoring while Pt-determined surface favors C-C cleavage."

"CeO2 as the most promising support due to its ability to activate CO2 via direct C=O bond scission."

"The well-recognized properties of cerium oxide materials regarding imporved oxygen mobility and oxygen storage capacity (OSC) was utilized towards the synthesis of stable catalytic systems."

"Olefin selectivity was found to depend on competitive reaction pathways such as ODH, reverse water gas shift as well as alkane dry reforming that can be tuned via rational selection of the bimetallic composition of active sites."

"CO2 has the ability to oxidize V2O3 to V2O4 and participates in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propylene."

"When using chromium or vanadium oxide based catalysts, CO2 can re-oxidize partially reduced metal oxides. It is generally accepted that it follows a proposed pathway which is in agreement with the Mars-Van Krevelen mechanism"

"For gallium and indium based catalysts, the promoting effect of CO2 is related to its enhancing effect on the removal of coke, the Boudouard reaction, and the reverse water gas shift (RWGS) reaction."

"According to the DFT-calculated Gibbs free energy profile at 600 C, the activation of the secondary CAH bond of propane (EDFT,act = 158 kJ/mol) is rate-limiting, while re-oxidation of the catalyst with CO2 is potentially much faster."

"CO2-assisted propane dehydrogenation results in a higher selectivity toward propylene production and a reduction of carbon formation."

"When the catalyst is reduced, and subsequently re-oxidized with CO2 instead of O2 at the same temperature, the H2 consumption peak is about 0.86 ± 0.13 mol/molVOx which is 45 ± 7% of that of the samples that have been oxidized by O2. This clearly indicates that less than half of the exchangeable oxygen is regenerated by CO2, which can be attributed to the oxidation of V2O3 into V2O4 instead of V2O5."
