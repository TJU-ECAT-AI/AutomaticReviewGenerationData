          "It is widely accepted that the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane over easily reducible transition metal oxides proceeds via a Mars–van Krevelen redox mechanism."

"Ethane must first adsorb (reaction 1) to a surface or lattice oxygen atom (O*), and a C–H bond must be cleaved forming an ethoxy intermediate and a hydroxyl group on the catalyst surface (reaction 2). This initial cleavage of the ethane C–H bond is considered the rate-limiting step"

"Gas-phase oxygen must then adsorb to a vacancy and reoxidize the active site (reaction 5)."

"Argyle et al. (4) have suggested that during ethane ODH on vanadium catalysts, the catalyst surface is reduced as lattice oxygen atoms activate ethane molecules, ultimately forming olefins."

"When using O2 as the oxidant, increasing the O2 concentration does not lead to an increase in ethylene formation rate because the molybdenum is already fully oxidized. When using N2O as the oxidant, however, an increase in concentration of N2O will increase the rate of catalyst re-oxidation."

"The use of N2O as oxidant makes the activation energy of re-oxidation much closer to the apparent ODH activation energy, which suggests that the rates of catalyst re-oxidation and reduction will be much closer when using N2O as oxidant."

"The XPS results indicate that molybdenum is in a lower oxidation state in the post-N2O oxidative dehydrogenation sample. The post-N2O sample contained Mo(VI), Mo(V), and Mo(IV), whereas the post-O2 sample appeared fully oxidized with only Mo(VI) appearing."

"The activation energy of re-oxidation when using N2O is 2.4 times higher than that required when using O2. This difference likely accounts for the ability of O2 to oxidize the reduced sample at lower temperatures than N2O."

          The mechanism of C-H bond activation and catalyst regeneration in oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of alkanes over redox-active metal oxide catalysts, such as vanadium and molybdenum oxides, follows the Mars-van Krevelen redox mechanism. The process involves:

1. C-H bond activation: Ethane adsorbs to a surface or lattice oxygen atom, followed by C-H bond cleavage to form an ethoxy intermediate and a hydroxyl group on the catalyst surface. This step is considered rate-limiting.

2. Catalyst reduction: As the reaction proceeds, the catalyst surface is reduced as lattice oxygen atoms activate alkane molecules to form olefins.

3. Catalyst regeneration: Gas-phase oxygen adsorbs to the vacancies created on the catalyst surface and reoxidizes the active sites.

The choice of oxidant significantly affects the catalyst's oxidation state and performance:

1. O2 as oxidant: The catalyst remains fully oxidized, and increasing O2 concentration does not affect the ethylene formation rate. The molybdenum catalyst stays in the Mo(VI) state.

2. N2O as oxidant: The catalyst operates in a more reduced state, with a mixture of Mo(VI), Mo(V), and Mo(IV). Increasing N2O concentration increases the rate of catalyst re-oxidation. The activation energy for re-oxidation with N2O is 2.4 times higher than with O2, making the re-oxidation step kinetically relevant.

The use of N2O allows the catalyst to operate in a more reduced state, which can improve selectivity to desired olefin products. However, O2 can oxidize the reduced catalyst at lower temperatures due to its lower activation energy for re-oxidation.

The provided information does not discuss redox-inactive catalysts, the use of CO2 as an oxidant, or the effectiveness of different catalysts (V2O5, VOx/SiO2, CeO2, and transition metal clusters) in activating CO2 for propane ODH. Therefore, these aspects of the question cannot be addressed based on the given information.

          在氧化还原活性金属氧化物催化剂（如钒和钼氧化物）上进行烷烃氧化脱氢（ODH）的C-H键活化和催化剂再生机理遵循Mars-van Krevelen氧化还原机制。该过程包括：

1. C-H键活化：乙烷吸附在表面或晶格氧原子上，随后C-H键断裂形成乙氧基中间体和催化剂表面的羟基。这一步被认为是速率限制步骤。

2. 催化剂还原：随着反应进行，催化剂表面被还原，晶格氧原子活化烷烃分子形成烯烃。

3. 催化剂再生：气相氧吸附到催化剂表面产生的空位上并重新氧化活性位点。

氧化剂的选择显著影响催化剂的氧化状态和性能：

1. O2作为氧化剂：催化剂保持完全氧化状态，增加O2浓度不影响乙烯形成速率。钼催化剂保持在Mo(VI)状态。

2. N2O作为氧化剂：催化剂在更还原的状态下运行，Mo(VI)、Mo(V)和Mo(IV)混合存在。增加N2O浓度会增加催化剂再氧化速率。使用N2O再氧化的活化能是使用O2时的2.4倍，使再氧化步骤在动力学上变得相关。

使用N2O允许催化剂在更还原的状态下运行，这可以提高目标烯烃产物的选择性。然而，由于O2再氧化的活化能较低，它可以在较低温度下氧化还原的催化剂。

提供的信息没有讨论氧化还原非活性催化剂、CO2作为氧化剂的使用，或不同催化剂（V2O5、VOx/SiO2、CeO2和过渡金属簇）在活化CO2用于丙烷ODH方面的效果。因此，基于给定信息无法讨论这些问题的方面。
