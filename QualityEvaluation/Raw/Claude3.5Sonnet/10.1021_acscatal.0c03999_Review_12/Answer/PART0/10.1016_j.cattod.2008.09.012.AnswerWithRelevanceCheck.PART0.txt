          "Irrespective of the alkane and the oxidant applied, the overall rate of alkane conversion increases with a decrease in the strength of the weakest CH bond in the alkane molecule indicating that alkane activation is the rate-limiting step."

"Alkanes react with oxidized VOx species yielding reduced ones. The reduced VOx species are reoxidized by N2O resulting in gas-phase N2 and restoring lattice oxygen species."

"TAP results, and SSITKA data consistent with Mar-van-Krevelen mechanism, where selective, and non-selective reactions occur on lattice oxygen of VOx species. This is valid for O2- and N2O-containing feeds."

"Recent DFT calculations of interaction of O2 and N2O with reduced and oxidized VOx species suggest that peroxo species are formed upon interaction of O2 but not N2O with reduced VOx species [26]. These bi-atomic oxygen species are further transformed to lattice oxygen ones. The latter species are also formed upon reoxidation of reduced VOx species by N2O."

"For both oxidants, the initial rate of alkane conversion follows the order: C2H6<C3H8<n-C4H10<iso-C4H10. It is important to highlight that the same order is also valid for the strength of the weakest CH bond in these alkanes [15,16]. Considering both experimental facts, it is suggested that the breaking of the weakest CH bond limits the ODH reaction over highly dispersed VOx species independent of the oxidant applied."

          The mechanisms of C-H bond activation and catalyst regeneration in oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of alkanes are primarily discussed for redox-active VOx catalysts, with a comparison between O2 and N2O as oxidants:

1. C-H bond activation:
   - The breaking of the weakest C-H bond in the alkane molecule is the rate-limiting step in ODH reactions.
   - This step occurs on the catalyst surface and is independent of the oxidant used.
   - The reactivity of alkanes increases as the strength of the weakest C-H bond decreases, following the order C2H6 < C3H8 < n-C4H10 < iso-C4H10.

2. Catalyst regeneration:
   - Follows a Mars-van Krevelen mechanism for both O2 and N2O oxidants.
   - Reduced VOx species are reoxidized by the oxidant, restoring lattice oxygen.
   - With O2: Forms peroxo species on reduced VOx, which then transform to lattice oxygen.
   - With N2O: Directly restores lattice oxygen without forming peroxo intermediates.

3. Oxidant comparison (O2 vs N2O):
   - N2O shows superior performance in terms of olefin selectivity.
   - N2O suppresses COx formation more effectively than O2.
   - O2 forms additional reactive oxygen species (possibly bi-atomic) that contribute to non-selective oxidation, while N2O does not form these species.

The literature does not discuss redox-inactive catalysts or the use of CO2 as an oxidant. It also does not provide information on other catalysts like V2O5, VOx/SiO2, CeO2, or transition metal clusters for CO2 activation in propane ODH.

          烷烃氧化脱氢(ODH)反应中C-H键活化和催化剂再生机理主要针对氧化还原活性VOx催化剂进行讨论，并比较了O2和N2O作为氧化剂的情况：

1. C-H键活化：
   - 烷烃分子中最弱C-H键的断裂是ODH反应的限速步骤。
   - 这一步骤发生在催化剂表面，与所使用的氧化剂无关。
   - 烷烃的反应活性随最弱C-H键强度的降低而增加，顺序为C2H6 < C3H8 < n-C4H10 < iso-C4H10。

2. 催化剂再生：
   - 对O2和N2O氧化剂都遵循Mars-van Krevelen机理。
   - 还原态VOx物种被氧化剂重新氧化，恢复晶格氧。
   - 使用O2时：在还原态VOx上形成过氧物种，然后转化为晶格氧。
   - 使用N2O时：直接恢复晶格氧，不形成过氧中间体。

3. 氧化剂比较（O2 vs N2O）：
   - N2O在烯烃选择性方面表现更优。
   - N2O比O2更有效地抑制COx的形成。
   - O2形成额外的活性氧物种（可能是双原子的），导致非选择性氧化，而N2O不形成这些物种。

该文献没有讨论氧化还原非活性催化剂或CO2作为氧化剂的使用。它也没有提供关于其他催化剂如V2O5、VOx/SiO2、CeO2或过渡金属簇在丙烷ODH中活化CO2的信息。
