          "It is commonly accepted that the ODP reaction over vanadia-based catalysts proceeds via a Mars–van Krevelen mechanism. This mechanism suggests that C3H8 removes lattice oxygen from VOx species, yielding C3H6, H2O, and a reduced VOx center (Eq. (3)). Subsequently, the lattice oxygen is replenished by gas-phase oxygen in a re-oxidation step (Eq. (4))."

          "Since the rate of catalyst re-oxidation by N2O is slower than that by O2, a lower steady-state concentration of lattice oxygen is expected to be responsible for C3H8 activation in the presence of N2O."

          "From the stoichiometric requirements of the ODP reaction it is postulated that one selective catalyst site should contain one to two active lattice-oxygen anions to obtain the desired propene. Active sites with more than two active lattice oxygen anions would favor the formation of waste products (i.e., CO and CO2) by consecutive total oxidation steps."

          The literature does not directly compare redox-active and redox-inactive metal oxide catalysts for oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of alkanes. However, it provides insights into the mechanism for vanadium-based catalysts, which are redox-active:

          1. C-H bond activation: For vanadia-based catalysts, the ODH of propane proceeds via a Mars-van Krevelen mechanism. Propane removes lattice oxygen from VOx species, producing propene, water, and reduced VOx.

          2. Catalyst regeneration: After C-H activation, gas-phase oxygen (O2 or N2O) replenishes the lattice oxygen in a re-oxidation step. The rate of this re-oxidation affects the overall catalytic performance.

          3. Role of oxidants: N2O re-oxidizes reduced VOx sites more slowly than O2, resulting in a lower concentration and density of active lattice oxygen. This leads to higher propene selectivity with N2O compared to O2.

          4. Selectivity considerations: The formation of COx requires several oxygen species, while C3H6 formation requires fewer. Therefore, lower densities/concentrations of active oxygen species favor propene formation over COx formation.

          The document does not provide information on redox-inactive catalysts, CO2 as an oxidant, or the effectiveness of other catalysts like CeO2 and transition metal clusters in activating CO2 for ODP. Therefore, a comprehensive comparison of these aspects cannot be made based on the given literature.

          该文献并未直接比较氧化还原活性和非活性金属氧化物催化剂在烷烃氧化脱氢(ODH)中的作用。但是,它提供了关于钒基催化剂(氧化还原活性催化剂)反应机理的见解:

          1. C-H键活化：对于钒基催化剂，丙烷的ODH通过Mars-van Krevelen机理进行。丙烷从VOx物种中移除晶格氧,生成丙烯、水和还原态的VOx。

          2. 催化剂再生：在C-H活化步骤之后，气相氧(O2或N2O)在再氧化步骤中补充晶格氧。这种再氧化的速率影响整体催化性能。

          3. 氧化剂的作用：N2O比O2更慢地再氧化还原态的VOx位点，导致活性晶格氧的浓度和密度较低。这使得使用N2O时的丙烯选择性高于使用O2时。

          4. 选择性考虑：COx的形成需要多个氧物种，而C3H6的形成需要的氧物种较少。因此，较低密度/浓度的活性氧物种有利于丙烯的形成而不是COx的形成。

          该文档没有提供关于氧化还原惰性催化剂、CO2作为氧化剂，或其他催化剂如CeO2和过渡金属簇在活化CO2用于ODP方面的有效性的信息。因此，基于给定的文献无法对这些方面进行全面的比较。
