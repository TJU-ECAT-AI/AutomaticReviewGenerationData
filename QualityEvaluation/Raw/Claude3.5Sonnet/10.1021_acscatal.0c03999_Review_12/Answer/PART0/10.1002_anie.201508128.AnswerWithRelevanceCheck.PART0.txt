          "ODH of ethane with CO2 as a mild oxidant is proposed to occur through a Mars-van-Krevelen-type mechanism, where the catalyst first dehydrogenates ethane into ethylene and H2, then H2 reduces CO2 to CO through the reverse water-gas shift (RWGS) reaction, producing H2O as a byproduct."

"To help mitigate the high deactivation over Mo2C/γ-Al2O3, a small amount of H2 (5vol%) was added to the reaction feed to remove inactive oxide species to complete the catalytic cycle and restore some of the active carbidic phase, leading to higher activity"

"Treatment in pure CO2, however, completely oxidizes Mo2C. Therefore, the adsorbed O from CO2 is necessary to form an oxycarbide phase, which dehydrogenates ethane, but also likely contributes, at least partially, to the deactivation seen over Mo2C-based catalysts."

"DFT was also used to calculate the enthalpy change for the oxidative CC and CH bond cleavage of ethane on Pt(111) and Mo2C(001) surfaces."

"The lower activation barrier of CO2 over Pt/CeO2 confirms the relatively high activity of CeO2-based materials toward CO2."

"Pt/CeO2 shows higher activity and selectivity toward reforming products, but Mo2C/γ-Al2O3 has a lower activity with increased ethylene selectivity"

          The mechanisms of C-H bond activation and catalyst regeneration in oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of alkanes differ between redox-active and redox-inactive metal oxide catalysts. For redox-active catalysts, the Mars-van Krevelen mechanism is typically involved, where lattice oxygen participates in the reaction. When using CO2 as an oxidant, the mechanism involves a two-step process: first, the catalyst dehydrogenates the alkane (e.g., ethane to ethylene), producing H2; then, H2 reduces CO2 to CO through the reverse water-gas shift reaction, regenerating the catalyst and producing water as a byproduct.

Catalyst effectiveness varies:
1. Mo2C-based catalysts show promise for ethylene production but suffer from deactivation due to the formation of an oxycarbide phase. Adding small amounts of H2 to the feed can help mitigate deactivation.
2. Pt-based catalysts, particularly Pt/CeO2, are more effective for producing synthesis gas through reforming rather than ODH. CeO2-based materials show high activity toward CO2 activation.

Energy barriers for CO2 dissociation and C-H bond activation differ among catalysts. On Pt/CeO2, CO2 has a lower activation barrier compared to ethane, while on Mo2C/γ-Al2O3, the trend is reversed. These differences contribute to varying product selectivities.

Traditional oxidants like O2 are not explicitly compared to CO2 in the given information. However, CO2 is described as a "mild oxidant," suggesting it may be less aggressive than O2 in oxidation reactions.

          烷烃氧化脱氢(ODH)中C-H键活化和催化剂再生的机理在氧化还原活性和非氧化还原活性金属氧化物催化剂之间存在差异。对于氧化还原活性催化剂，通常涉及Mars-van Krevelen机理，其中晶格氧参与反应。当使用CO2作为氧化剂时，机理涉及两步过程：首先，催化剂使烷烃（如乙烷到乙烯）脱氢，产生H2；然后，H2通过逆水气变换反应将CO2还原为CO，再生催化剂并产生水作为副产品。

催化剂效果各不相同：
1. 基于Mo2C的催化剂在乙烯生产方面显示出前景，但由于氧碳化物相的形成而遭受失活。向进料中添加少量H2可以帮助减轻失活。
2. 基于Pt的催化剂，特别是Pt/CeO2，通过重整而不是ODH更有效地生产合成气。基于CeO2的材料对CO2活化表现出高活性。

CO2解离和C-H键活化的能垒在不同催化剂之间存在差异。在Pt/CeO2上，CO2的活化能垒比乙烷低，而在Mo2C/γ-Al2O3上，这一趋势相反。这些差异导致了不同的产物选择性。

在给出的信息中没有明确比较传统氧化剂如O2与CO2。然而，CO2被描述为"温和氧化剂"，这表明它在氧化反应中可能比O2更温和。
