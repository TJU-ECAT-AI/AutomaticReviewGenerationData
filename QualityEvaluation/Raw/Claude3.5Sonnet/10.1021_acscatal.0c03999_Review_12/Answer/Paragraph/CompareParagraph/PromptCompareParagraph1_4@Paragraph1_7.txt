The mechanisms of C-H bond activation and catalyst regeneration in oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of alkanes differ significantly between redox-active and redox-inactive metal oxide catalysts. This review focuses on these mechanisms, emphasizing the role of traditional oxidants and CO2, and the effectiveness of various catalysts in activating CO2 for ODH of propane.

Redox-active catalysts, such as V2O5, VOx/SiO2, and Cr2O3, typically operate through a Mars-van Krevelen (MvK) mechanism [10.1016/j.cattod.2008.09.012]. In this process, lattice oxygen participates in C-H bond activation, forming alkenes and reducing the metal center. The catalyst is then regenerated by reoxidation with an oxidant, filling the oxygen vacancy [10.1038/s41570-019-0128-9]. The breaking of the weakest C-H bond in the alkane molecule is generally the rate-limiting step, with reactivity increasing as bond strength decreases: C2H6 < C3H8 < n-C4H10 < iso-C4H10 [10.1016/j.cattod.2008.09.012].

In contrast, redox-inactive catalysts like Ga2O3 and h-BN operate through heterolytic dissociation of alkanes and separate CO2 activation, without involving changes in metal oxidation state [10.1038/s41570-019-0128-9] [10.1002/anie.202002440]. These catalysts often show lower selectivity to carbon oxides and higher selectivity to desired olefins compared to redox-active catalysts [10.1002/anie.202002440].

The choice of oxidant significantly impacts catalyst performance and reaction mechanisms. Traditional oxidants like O2 can fully reoxidize redox-active catalysts but may lead to over-oxidation and lower selectivity. CO2, as a milder oxidant, offers several advantages:

1. Suppression of over-oxidation, minimizing carbon oxide production [10.1038/s41467-018-03793-w].
2. Enhanced propane conversion through the reverse water-gas shift (RWGS) reaction [10.1038/s41467-018-03793-w].
3. Reduction of coke formation [10.1039/D0CY00586J].

The effectiveness of different catalysts in activating CO2 for ODH of propane varies:

1. V2O5 and VOx/SiO2: These show moderate activity, with CO2 reoxidizing partially reduced metal oxides. However, the energy barrier for CO2 oxidation of V sites is significant (1.76-3.16 eV) [10.1021/acscatal.0c03999\_12].

2. CeO2-based catalysts: These are highly promising due to their ability to activate CO2 via direct C=O bond scission, with a lower energy barrier (1.36 eV) [10.1021/acscatal.0c03999\_12]. CeO2's oxygen storage capacity and improved oxygen mobility contribute to its effectiveness [10.1039/D0CY00586J].

3. Bimetallic catalysts on CeO2: Fe-Ni/CeO2 favors C-H bond activation for the ODH pathway, while Pt-containing catalysts tend to promote C-C bond cleavage [10.1038/s41467-018-03793-w].

4. Transition metal clusters: Ni4/MgO shows a remarkably low CO2 dissociation barrier (0.35 eV), making it highly effective for CO2 activation [10.1021/acscatal.0c03999\_12].

The effectiveness of these catalysts in activating CO2 generally follows the order: Ni4/MgO > CeO2 > VOx/SiO2 > V2O5 [10.1021/acscatal.0c03999\_12].



Integrative understanding and prospective outlook: The development of efficient catalysts for CO2-assisted ODH of alkanes represents a promising direction in sustainable chemistry. The use of CO2 as a mild oxidant not only addresses environmental concerns but also offers improved selectivity and reduced coking. Future research should focus on:

1. Designing novel multi-component catalysts that combine the CO2 activation ability of CeO2 with the selective C-H bond activation properties of transition metals.

2. Exploring the potential of other redox-inactive supports beyond CeO2 to further enhance CO2 activation and selectivity.

3. Developing in-situ characterization techniques to better understand the dynamic nature of catalyst surfaces under reaction conditions, particularly the interaction between CO2 and the catalyst.

4. Investigating the long-term stability of catalysts under CO2-rich environments and developing strategies to mitigate deactivation.

5. Scaling up CO2-assisted ODH processes for industrial application, considering aspects such as heat management and process integration with CO2 capture technologies.

These research directions could lead to more efficient and environmentally friendly processes for olefin production, contributing to the broader goal of CO2 utilization in chemical manufacturing.

The mechanisms of C-H bond activation and catalyst regeneration in oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of alkanes differ significantly between redox-active and redox-inactive metal oxide catalysts. This review will focus on these mechanisms, the role of traditional oxidants and CO2, and the effectiveness of different catalysts in activating CO2 for ODH of propane.

Redox-active catalysts, such as V2O5, VOx/SiO2, and Cr2O3, typically operate via a Mars-van Krevelen (MvK) mechanism [10.1016/j.cattod.2008.09.012]. In this process, lattice oxygen from the metal oxide participates in C-H bond activation, forming the desired alkene and reducing the metal center. The catalyst is then regenerated by re-oxidation with a gas-phase oxidant [10.1021/jp810664u]. The rate-limiting step in this mechanism is usually the breaking of the weakest C-H bond in the alkane molecule [10.1016/j.cattod.2008.09.012].

In contrast, redox-inactive catalysts like Ga2O3 and h-BN operate through different mechanisms. These catalysts typically activate C-H bonds through heterolytic dissociation over acid-base pairs and do not involve changes in metal oxidation states [10.1038/s41570-019-0128-9] [10.1002/anie.202002440]. The catalyst surface brings together hydrogen and the oxidant, which is reduced directly without forming oxygen vacancies [10.1021/acscatal.0c03999\_12].

Traditional oxidants like O2 can fully re-oxidize redox-active catalysts, but they often lead to over-oxidation and lower selectivity. CO2, as a milder oxidant, offers several advantages:

1. It suppresses over-oxidation and minimizes carbon oxide production [10.1038/s41467-018-03793-w].
2. It can increase propane conversion by consuming H2 through the reverse water-gas shift (RWGS) reaction [10.1038/s41467-018-03793-w].
3. It helps maintain higher oxidation states of metal species, particularly for V2O5 and Cr2O3 [10.1016/S0920-5861(03)00268-2].
4. It assists in coke removal and participates in the Boudouard reaction [10.1016/j.jcat.2015.12.015].

The effectiveness of different catalysts in activating CO2 for ODH of propane varies:

1. V2O5 and VOx/SiO2: These catalysts show moderate activity. CO2 can re-oxidize V2O3 to V2O4, but not to V2O5, leading to higher propylene selectivity [10.1016/j.jcat.2015.12.015]. However, the energy barrier for CO2 activation is still significant (1.76 eV for VOx/SiO2) [10.1021/acscatal.0c03999\_12].

2. CeO2-based catalysts: These are considered highly promising due to their ability to activate CO2 via direct C=O bond scission [10.1039/D0CY00586J]. CeO2 can store and release oxygen, facilitating CO2 dissociation with a lower energy barrier (1.36 eV) [10.1021/acscatal.0c03999\_12].

3. Bimetallic catalysts on CeO2: Fe-Ni/CeO2 favors C-H bond activation for the ODH pathway, while Pt-containing catalysts tend to promote C-C bond cleavage [10.1038/s41467-018-03793-w].

4. Transition metal clusters: Some studies have shown promising results, such as Ni4/MgO with a low CO2 dissociation barrier of 0.35 eV [10.1021/acscatal.0c03999\_12].

The effectiveness of these catalysts in activating CO2 generally follows the order: Transition metal clusters > CeO2-based catalysts > VOx/SiO2 > V2O5 [10.1021/acscatal.0c03999\_12].



Integrative understanding and prospective outlook: The development of efficient catalysts for CO2-assisted ODH of alkanes represents a promising direction for sustainable chemical production. The use of CO2 as a mild oxidant offers multiple benefits, including improved selectivity, reduced carbon formation, and potential CO2 utilization. Future research should focus on:

1. Designing multi-functional catalysts that combine the CO2 activation ability of CeO2 with the selective C-H bond activation properties of transition metals.
2. Exploring novel bimetallic compositions to optimize the balance between ODH, RWGS, and dry reforming pathways.
3. Investigating the role of support materials in enhancing CO2 activation and improving catalyst stability.
4. Developing in-situ characterization techniques to better understand the dynamic changes in catalyst structure and oxidation states during CO2-assisted ODH reactions.
5. Exploring the potential of artificial intelligence and machine learning in predicting and designing more effective catalyst compositions for CO2-assisted ODH.

These research directions could lead to more efficient and sustainable processes for alkane conversion, contributing to the broader goals of carbon dioxide utilization and green chemistry.
