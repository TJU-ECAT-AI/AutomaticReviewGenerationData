The oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of alkanes is a promising alternative to traditional dehydrogenation processes, offering potential energy savings and improved selectivity. At the heart of this process are the mechanisms of C-H bond activation, catalyst regeneration, and oxidant utilization, particularly when employing metal oxide catalysts. The C-H bond activation typically occurs through a Mars-van Krevelen mechanism, where lattice oxygen from the metal oxide catalyst abstracts hydrogen from the alkane, forming a reactive intermediate. Catalyst regeneration is crucial for maintaining activity and involves replenishing the lattice oxygen, traditionally accomplished using molecular oxygen. However, recent research has explored the use of CO2 as an alternative oxidant, which not only serves to regenerate the catalyst but also offers the potential for CO2 utilization and mitigation. The use of CO2 in ODH presents unique challenges and opportunities, including the need for carefully designed catalysts that can activate both the alkane and CO2 efficiently. Understanding these mechanisms is essential for developing more effective and sustainable ODH processes, with potential applications in the production of valuable olefins and the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions.

The mechanisms of C-H bond activation and catalyst regeneration in oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of alkanes differ significantly between redox-active and redox-inactive metal oxide catalysts. This review will focus on these mechanisms, the role of traditional oxidants and CO2, and the effectiveness of different catalysts in activating CO2 for ODH of propane.

Redox-active catalysts, such as V2O5, VOx/SiO2, and Cr2O3, typically operate via a Mars-van Krevelen (MvK) mechanism [10.1016/j.cattod.2008.09.012]. In this process, lattice oxygen from the metal oxide participates in C-H bond activation, forming the desired alkene and reducing the metal center. The catalyst is then regenerated by re-oxidation with a gas-phase oxidant [10.1021/jp810664u]. The rate-limiting step in this mechanism is usually the breaking of the weakest C-H bond in the alkane molecule [10.1016/j.cattod.2008.09.012].

In contrast, redox-inactive catalysts like Ga2O3 and h-BN operate through different mechanisms. These catalysts typically activate C-H bonds through heterolytic dissociation over acid-base pairs and do not involve changes in metal oxidation states [10.1038/s41570-019-0128-9] [10.1002/anie.202002440]. The catalyst surface brings together hydrogen and the oxidant, which is reduced directly without forming oxygen vacancies [10.1021/acscatal.0c03999\_12].

Traditional oxidants like O2 can fully re-oxidize redox-active catalysts, but they often lead to over-oxidation and lower selectivity. CO2, as a milder oxidant, offers several advantages:

1. It suppresses over-oxidation and minimizes carbon oxide production [10.1038/s41467-018-03793-w].
2. It can increase propane conversion by consuming H2 through the reverse water-gas shift (RWGS) reaction [10.1038/s41467-018-03793-w].
3. It helps maintain higher oxidation states of metal species, particularly for V2O5 and Cr2O3 [10.1016/S0920-5861(03)00268-2].
4. It assists in coke removal and participates in the Boudouard reaction [10.1016/j.jcat.2015.12.015].

The effectiveness of different catalysts in activating CO2 for ODH of propane varies:

1. V2O5 and VOx/SiO2: These catalysts show moderate activity. CO2 can re-oxidize V2O3 to V2O4, but not to V2O5, leading to higher propylene selectivity [10.1016/j.jcat.2015.12.015]. However, the energy barrier for CO2 activation is still significant (1.76 eV for VOx/SiO2) [10.1021/acscatal.0c03999\_12].

2. CeO2-based catalysts: These are considered highly promising due to their ability to activate CO2 via direct C=O bond scission [10.1039/D0CY00586J]. CeO2 can store and release oxygen, facilitating CO2 dissociation with a lower energy barrier (1.36 eV) [10.1021/acscatal.0c03999\_12].

3. Bimetallic catalysts on CeO2: Fe-Ni/CeO2 favors C-H bond activation for the ODH pathway, while Pt-containing catalysts tend to promote C-C bond cleavage [10.1038/s41467-018-03793-w].

4. Transition metal clusters: Some studies have shown promising results, such as Ni4/MgO with a low CO2 dissociation barrier of 0.35 eV [10.1021/acscatal.0c03999\_12].

The effectiveness of these catalysts in activating CO2 generally follows the order: Transition metal clusters > CeO2-based catalysts > VOx/SiO2 > V2O5 [10.1021/acscatal.0c03999\_12].



Integrative understanding and prospective outlook: The development of efficient catalysts for CO2-assisted ODH of alkanes represents a promising direction for sustainable chemical production. The use of CO2 as a mild oxidant offers multiple benefits, including improved selectivity, reduced carbon formation, and potential CO2 utilization. Future research should focus on:

1. Designing multi-functional catalysts that combine the CO2 activation ability of CeO2 with the selective C-H bond activation properties of transition metals.
2. Exploring novel bimetallic compositions to optimize the balance between ODH, RWGS, and dry reforming pathways.
3. Investigating the role of support materials in enhancing CO2 activation and improving catalyst stability.
4. Developing in-situ characterization techniques to better understand the dynamic changes in catalyst structure and oxidation states during CO2-assisted ODH reactions.
5. Exploring the potential of artificial intelligence and machine learning in predicting and designing more effective catalyst compositions for CO2-assisted ODH.

These research directions could lead to more efficient and sustainable processes for alkane conversion, contributing to the broader goals of carbon dioxide utilization and green chemistry.
