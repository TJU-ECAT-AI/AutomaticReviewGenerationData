The mechanisms of C-H bond activation and catalyst regeneration in oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of alkanes differ significantly between redox-active and redox-inactive metal oxide catalysts. This review focuses on these mechanisms, emphasizing the role of traditional oxidants and CO2, and the effectiveness of various catalysts in activating CO2 for propane ODH.

Redox-active catalysts, such as V2O5, VOx/SiO2, and Cr2O3, typically operate via a Mars-van Krevelen (MvK) mechanism [10.1016/S0920-5861(03)00268-2]. In this process, lattice oxygen participates in C-H bond activation, forming alkenes and reducing the metal center. The catalyst is then regenerated by re-oxidation with gas-phase oxidants [10.1021/jp810664u]. For traditional oxidants like O2, this re-oxidation is rapid and keeps the catalyst in a highly oxidized state. When using CO2 as an oxidant, the mechanism involves a two-step process: first, the catalyst dehydrogenates the alkane, producing H2; then, H2 reduces CO2 to CO through the reverse water-gas shift (RWGS) reaction, regenerating the catalyst [10.1002/anie.201508128].

In contrast, redox-inactive catalysts like CeO2 and Ga2O3 operate through different mechanisms. They activate C-H bonds through acid-base interactions or heterolytic dissociation, without involving changes in metal oxidation states [10.1038/s41570-019-0128-9]. For these catalysts, CO2 activation often occurs separately from the C-H activation step.

The effectiveness of different catalysts in activating CO2 for ODH of propane varies:

1. V2O5 and VOx/SiO2: These catalysts show moderate activity in CO2 activation. On pure V2O5, the barrier for CO2 to oxidize VIII sites is high (3.16 eV), while on VOx/SiO2, the barrier is lower but still significant (1.76 eV) [10.1021/acscatal.0c03999_12].

2. CeO2-based catalysts: These are considered highly promising due to their ability to activate CO2 via direct C=O bond scission. The CeO2 (110) surface with oxygen vacancies shows a lower barrier for CO2 dissociation (1.36 eV) compared to vanadium-based catalysts [10.1021/acscatal.0c03999_12] [10.1039/D0CY00586J].

3. Transition metal clusters: Some systems, like Ni4/MgO, show very low barriers for CO2 dissociation (0.35 eV), making them highly effective in activating CO2 [10.1021/acscatal.0c03999_12].

4. Bimetallic catalysts: Fe-Ni and Ni-Pt catalysts supported on CeO2 show promise in CO2-assisted ODH. The Fe-Ni surface favors C-H bond activation, while Pt-containing surfaces tend to promote C-C bond cleavage [10.1038/s41467-018-03793-w].

CO2 as an oxidant offers several advantages over traditional oxidants like O2. It acts as a milder oxidant, suppressing over-oxidation and minimizing carbon oxide production [10.1038/s41467-018-03793-w]. For vanadium-based catalysts, CO2 can oxidize V2O3 to V2O4, but not to V2O5, leading to higher selectivity towards propylene and reduced carbon formation [10.1016/j.jcat.2015.12.015].

The effectiveness of these catalysts in CO2-assisted ODH depends on their ability to activate both CO2 and the alkane substrate while maintaining selectivity towards the desired alkene product. The energy barriers for CO2 dissociation and C-H bond activation play crucial roles in determining catalyst performance.

※※※

Integrative understanding and prospective outlook: The field of CO2-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes presents exciting opportunities for sustainable chemical production. The use of CO2 as a soft oxidant not only provides a pathway for CO2 utilization but also offers improved selectivity in alkane conversion. Future research directions may include:

1. Rational design of multi-component catalysts: Combining the CO2 activation ability of CeO2 with the selective C-H activation properties of transition metals could lead to highly efficient catalysts. Exploring novel combinations of metals and supports may yield synergistic effects that further lower energy barriers for both CO2 dissociation and alkane activation.

2. In-situ characterization techniques: Developing advanced spectroscopic methods to study the catalyst surface under reaction conditions could provide deeper insights into the reaction mechanisms and the nature of active sites. This could help bridge the gap between theoretical predictions and experimental observations.

3. Computational screening: High-throughput computational studies could be employed to predict the performance of a wide range of catalyst compositions, guiding experimental efforts towards the most promising systems.

4. Process intensification: Exploring innovative reactor designs or coupling CO2-assisted ODH with other reactions (e.g., RWGS) in a single process could improve overall efficiency and economics.

5. Expanding to other alkanes: While much focus has been on ethane and propane, investigating the applicability of CO2-assisted ODH to higher alkanes or cyclic hydrocarbons could open new avenues for valuable chemical production.

By addressing these research directions, we can work towards developing more efficient and sustainable processes for alkane conversion, contributing to the broader goals of CO2 utilization and green chemistry.

The mechanisms of C-H bond activation and catalyst regeneration in oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of alkanes differ significantly between redox-active and redox-inactive metal oxide catalysts.

The catalyst is then regenerated by reoxidation with an oxidant, filling the oxygen vacancy [10.1038/s41570-019-0128-9].

For redox-inactive catalysts like CeO2 and Ga2O3, the mechanism differs. These catalysts operate through heterolytic dissociation of alkanes and separate CO2 activation, without involving changes in metal oxidation states [10.1038/s41570-019-0128-9]. The C-H activation occurs heterolytically over an acid-base pair, and the catalyst surface brings together hydrogen and the oxidant, which is reduced directly [10.1021/acscatal.0c03999_12].

Traditional oxidants like O2 can fully reoxidize redox-active catalysts, but they often lead to over-oxidation and lower selectivity [10.1039/C7CY01033H]. CO2, on the other hand, acts as a milder oxidant, suppressing over-oxidation and minimizing carbon oxide production [10.1038/s41467-018-03793-w]. CO2 also participates in the reverse water-gas shift reaction, which can enhance alkane conversion [10.1039/D0CY00586J].

The effectiveness of different catalysts in activating CO2 for ODH of propane varies:

1. V2O5 and VOx/SiO2: These catalysts show moderate activity. CO2 can oxidize V2O3 to V2O4, but not to V2O5, leading to higher selectivity towards propylene [10.1016/j.jcat.2015.12.015].

2. CeO2-based catalysts: These are considered highly promising due to their ability to activate CO2 via direct C=O bond scission [10.1039/D0CY00586J]. CeO2 facilitates CO2 dissociation with a lower energy barrier (1.36 eV) on surfaces with oxygen vacancies [10.1021/acscatal.0c03999_12].

3. Transition metal clusters: Some show high effectiveness in CO2 activation. For example, Ni4/MgO exhibits a low CO2 dissociation barrier of 0.35 eV [10.1021/acscatal.0c03999_12].

4. Bimetallic catalysts: Fe-Ni and Ni-Pt catalysts supported on CeO2 show promise for CO2-ODHP. Fe-Ni surfaces favor C-H bond activation, while Pt-containing surfaces tend to promote C-C bond cleavage [10.1038/s41467-018-03793-w].

The effectiveness of these catalysts in activating CO2 generally follows the order: Transition metal clusters (e.g., Ni4/MgO) > CeO2-based catalysts > VOx/SiO2 > V2O5 [10.1021/acscatal.0c03999_12].

Integrative understanding and prospective outlook: The field of oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes using CO2 as an oxidant presents exciting opportunities for future research and development. The use of CO2 as a mild oxidant offers potential advantages in terms of selectivity and carbon utilization, addressing both environmental and economic concerns.

Future research directions may include:

1. Rational design of multi-functional catalysts: Combining the CO2 activation ability of CeO2 with the selective C-H activation properties of transition metals could lead to more efficient catalysts. Exploring novel bimetallic or even trimetallic combinations supported on CeO2 or other reducible oxides may yield catalysts with superior performance.

2. In-depth mechanistic studies: Advanced in-situ and operando characterization techniques could provide deeper insights into the reaction mechanisms, particularly for redox-inactive catalysts and the role of CO2 in these systems.

3. Computational screening and machine learning: High-throughput computational screening coupled with machine learning algorithms could accelerate the discovery of new catalyst compositions with optimal CO2 activation and C-H bond cleavage properties.

4. Process intensification: Exploring novel reactor designs or process configurations that can enhance the synergy between CO2 activation and alkane dehydrogenation could lead to more efficient and economically viable processes.

5. Expanding to other alkanes: While much of the current research focuses on ethane and propane, extending these concepts to higher alkanes or even cyclic alkanes could open up new possibilities for valuable chemical production.

By addressing these research directions, we can anticipate significant advancements in CO2-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation technology, potentially leading to more sustainable and efficient processes for olefin production in the future.

The catalyst is then regenerated by re-oxidation with gas-phase oxidants [10.1016/j.cattod.2008.09.012]. The breaking of the weakest C-H bond in the alkane molecule is generally considered the rate-limiting step, with reactivity increasing as bond strength decreases in the order C2H6 < C3H8 < n-C4H10 < iso-C4H10 [10.1016/j.cattod.2008.09.012].

In contrast, redox-inactive catalysts like Ga2O3 or CeO2 operate through different mechanisms. These catalysts activate C-H bonds through heterolytic dissociation over acid-base pairs or via surface oxygen species, without involving changes in metal oxidation states [10.1038/s41570-019-0128-9]. The catalyst regeneration occurs through direct reduction of the oxidant on the surface rather than through redox cycling of the metal [10.1021/acscatal.0c03999_12].

The choice of oxidant significantly impacts catalyst performance and selectivity. Traditional oxidants like O2 can fully re-oxidize redox-active catalysts but may lead to over-oxidation and lower selectivity. CO2, as a milder oxidant, offers several advantages:

1. Suppression of over-oxidation, minimizing carbon oxide production [10.1038/s41467-018-03793-w].

3. Reduced coke formation on the catalyst surface [10.1039/D0CY00586J].

For redox-active catalysts, CO2 can partially re-oxidize reduced metal centers. For example, CO2 can oxidize V2O3 to V2O4 in vanadium-based catalysts, but not to V2O5, leading to higher propylene selectivity compared to O2 [10.1016/j.jcat.2015.12.015].

The effectiveness of different catalysts in activating CO2 for propane ODH varies:

1. V2O5 and VOx/SiO2: These catalysts show moderate activity, with CO2 activation barriers of 3.16 eV and 1.76 eV, respectively [10.1021/acscatal.0c03999_12].

4. Transition metal clusters: Ni4/MgO shows a remarkably low CO2 dissociation barrier of 0.35 eV, making it highly effective for CO2 activation [10.1021/acscatal.0c03999_12].

Integrative understanding and prospective outlook: The field of CO2-assisted ODH of alkanes presents exciting opportunities for developing more efficient and sustainable catalytic processes. The use of CO2 as a mild oxidant offers a promising route to enhance selectivity and reduce carbon footprint simultaneously. Future research directions may include:

1. Rational design of multi-functional catalysts: Combining the CO2 activation ability of CeO2 with the selective C-H bond activation properties of transition metals could lead to highly efficient catalysts for CO2-assisted ODH.

4. Process intensification: Integrating CO2-assisted ODH with other reactions, such as the reverse water-gas shift, could lead to more efficient utilization of CO2 and improved overall process economics.

5. Computational screening: Leveraging high-throughput computational methods to predict catalyst performance and guide experimental efforts could accelerate the discovery of novel, high-performance catalysts for CO2-assisted ODH.

2. CeO2-based catalysts: These are highly effective due to their ability to store and release oxygen, facilitating CO2 dissociation [10.1038/s41467-018-03793-w]. The energy barrier for CO2 dissociation on CeO2 (110) surface with oxygen vacancies is 1.36 eV [10.1021/acscatal.0c03999_12].

The proposed mechanisms for CO2 participation in ODH include direct CO2 dissociation to CO and O, and CO2 hydrogenation to HOCO or COOH before forming CO [10.1021/acscatal.0c03999_12]. The effectiveness of these pathways depends on the catalyst's ability to lower energy barriers for CO2 dissociation and subsequent ODH steps.

Integrative understanding and prospective outlook: The development of efficient catalysts for CO2-assisted ODH of propane represents a significant opportunity in the field of sustainable chemistry. The use of CO2 as a mild oxidant not only addresses environmental concerns but also offers improved selectivity in alkane activation. Future research directions may include:

1. Designing multi-functional catalysts that combine the CO2 activation properties of CeO2 with the selective C-H bond activation capabilities of transition metals.
2. Exploring novel redox-inactive materials that can facilitate CO2 activation without promoting over-oxidation.
3. Developing in-situ characterization techniques to better understand the dynamic surface processes during CO2-assisted ODH.
4. Investigating the potential of metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) or single-atom catalysts for precise control over active sites in CO2-assisted ODH reactions.
5. Exploring the use of renewable energy sources to drive the endothermic CO2 activation process, further enhancing the sustainability of the ODH process.

These research avenues could lead to more efficient and environmentally friendly processes for olefin production, contributing to the broader goals of carbon utilization and sustainable chemical manufacturing.

The effectiveness of different catalysts in activating CO2 for ODH of propane varies:

1. V2O5 and VOx/SiO2: These show moderate activity, with CO2 reoxidizing partially reduced metal oxides. However, the energy barrier for CO2 oxidation of V sites is significant (1.76-3.16 eV) [10.1021/acscatal.0c03999_12].

Integrative understanding and prospective outlook: The development of efficient catalysts for CO2-assisted ODH of alkanes represents a promising direction in sustainable chemistry. The use of CO2 as a mild oxidant not only addresses environmental concerns but also offers improved selectivity and reduced coking. Future research should focus on:

1. Designing novel multi-component catalysts that combine the CO2 activation ability of CeO2 with the selective C-H bond activation properties of transition metals.

The mechanisms of C-H bond activation and catalyst regeneration in oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of alkanes differ significantly between redox-active and redox-inactive metal oxide catalysts. This review focuses on these mechanisms, emphasizing the role of traditional oxidants and CO2, and discusses the effectiveness of various catalysts in activating CO2 for ODH of propane.

Redox-active catalysts, such as V2O5, VOx/SiO2, and Cr2O3, typically operate via a Mars-van Krevelen (MvK) mechanism [10.1016/j.jcat.2005.05.025]. In this process, lattice oxygen participates in C-H bond activation, forming alkenes and reducing the metal center. The catalyst is then regenerated by re-oxidation with gas-phase oxidants [10.1016/j.cattod.2008.09.012]. The breaking of the weakest C-H bond in the alkane molecule is generally considered the rate-limiting step, with reactivity increasing as bond strength decreases [10.1016/j.cattod.2008.09.012].

Redox-inactive catalysts, such as Ga2O3 and h-BN, operate through different mechanisms. These catalysts activate C-H bonds through heterolytic dissociation over acid-base pairs and do not involve changes in metal oxidation states [10.1038/s41570-019-0128-9]. The catalyst surface brings together hydrogen and the oxidant, which is reduced directly without forming oxygen vacancies [10.1021/acscatal.0c03999_12].

Traditional oxidants like O2 can fully re-oxidize redox-active catalysts, but they often lead to over-oxidation and lower selectivity. CO2, when used as an oxidant, acts as a milder alternative with several advantages:

1. It suppresses over-oxidation, minimizing carbon oxide production [10.1038/s41467-018-03793-w].
2. It reduces coke formation [10.1039/D0CY00586J].
3. It enhances alkane conversion through the reverse water-gas shift (RWGS) reaction [10.1038/s41467-018-03793-w].

The effectiveness of different catalysts in activating CO2 for ODH of propane varies:

1. V2O5 and VOx/SiO2: These catalysts show moderate activity. CO2 can oxidize V2O3 to V2O4, but not to V2O5, leading to higher propylene selectivity [10.1016/j.jcat.2015.12.015]. The energy barrier for CO2 to re-oxidize VOx/SiO2 is 1.76 eV, which is lower than pure V2O5 but still significant [10.1021/acscatal.0c03999_12].

2. CeO2-based catalysts: These are considered highly promising due to their ability to activate CO2 via direct C=O bond scission [10.1039/D0CY00586J]. CeO2 facilitates CO2 dissociation with a rate-limiting barrier of 1.36 eV on surfaces with oxygen vacancies [10.1021/acscatal.0c03999_12].

3. Transition metal clusters: Some systems, like Ni4/MgO, show remarkably low CO2 dissociation barriers (0.35 eV), making them highly effective for CO2 activation [10.1021/acscatal.0c03999_12].

4. Bimetallic catalysts: Fe-Ni surfaces supported on CeO2 favor C-H bond activation, while Pt-containing surfaces tend to promote C-C bond cleavage [10.1038/s41467-018-03793-w].

The effectiveness of these catalysts in activating CO2 generally follows the order: Transition metal clusters > CeO2-based catalysts > VOx/SiO2 > V2O5. This trend is based on the energy barriers for CO2 dissociation or activation, which is the proposed mechanism for CO2 utilization in these systems.

Integrative understanding and prospective outlook: The development of efficient catalysts for CO2-assisted ODH of alkanes represents a significant opportunity in the field of sustainable chemistry. The use of CO2 as a mild oxidant not only addresses environmental concerns but also offers improved selectivity and reduced coke formation compared to traditional oxidants.

Future research directions may include:

1. Designing novel multi-component catalysts that combine the CO2 activation ability of CeO2 with the selective C-H bond activation properties of transition metals.

2. Exploring the potential of single-atom catalysts or metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) for precise control over active sites and improved CO2 activation.

3. Investigating the role of catalyst support materials in facilitating CO2 activation and enhancing catalyst stability.

4. Developing in-situ characterization techniques to better understand the dynamic nature of catalyst surfaces under reaction conditions, particularly in the presence of CO2.

5. Computational studies to predict and design catalysts with optimal binding energies for both CO2 and alkane substrates, potentially leading to more efficient and selective ODH processes.

These advancements could pave the way for more sustainable production of olefins and contribute to the broader goal of CO2 utilization in chemical processes.

In this process, lattice oxygen participates in C-H bond activation, forming alkenes and reducing the metal center. The catalyst is then regenerated by re-oxidation with gas-phase oxidants [10.1021/jp810664u]. For vanadium-based catalysts, the breaking of the weakest C-H bond in the alkane molecule is the rate-limiting step, with reactivity increasing as C-H bond strength decreases: C2H6 < C3H8 < n-C4H10 < iso-C4H10 [10.1016/j.cattod.2008.09.012].

Redox-inactive catalysts, such as Ga2O3 and h-BN, operate through different mechanisms. They typically activate C-H bonds through heterolytic dissociation over acid-base pairs and do not involve changes in metal oxidation states [10.1038/s41570-019-0128-9]. These catalysts show lower selectivity towards carbon oxides and higher selectivity to desired alkenes compared to redox-active catalysts [10.1002/anie.202002440].

The choice of oxidant significantly impacts catalyst performance and selectivity. Traditional oxidants like O2 can fully re-oxidize redox-active catalysts but may lead to over-oxidation and lower selectivity. CO2, as a milder oxidant, offers several advantages:

1. Suppression of over-oxidation, minimizing carbon oxide production [10.1038/s41467-018-03793-w].

3. Reduced coke formation on the catalyst surface [10.1016/j.jcat.2015.12.015].

The effectiveness of different catalysts in activating CO2 for propane ODH varies:

1. V2O5 and VOx/SiO2: Moderately effective, with CO2 re-oxidizing partially reduced metal oxides. VOx/SiO2 shows a lower barrier (1.76 eV) for CO2 activation compared to pure V2O5 (3.16 eV) [10.1021/acscatal.0c03999_12].

2. CeO2-based catalysts: Highly effective due to their ability to activate CO2 via direct C=O bond scission. CeO2 (110) surfaces with oxygen vacancies show a lower barrier (1.36 eV) for CO2 dissociation [10.1021/acscatal.0c03999_12]. CeO2 supports also enhance CO2 activation when combined with transition metals [10.1002/anie.201508128].

3. Bimetallic catalysts on CeO2: Fe-Ni systems favor C-H bond activation, while Pt-containing catalysts promote C-C bond cleavage [10.1038/s41467-018-03793-w].

Integrative understanding and prospective outlook: The research on CO2-assisted ODH of alkanes has revealed promising pathways for more sustainable and selective olefin production. The use of CO2 as a mild oxidant offers a unique opportunity to address multiple challenges in the field of catalysis and petrochemical industry.

Future research directions may focus on:

1. Developing novel multi-component catalysts that combine the CO2 activation ability of CeO2 with the selective C-H bond activation properties of transition metals.

2. Exploring the potential of other redox-inactive supports or 2D materials that can facilitate CO2 activation while maintaining high selectivity towards desired olefins.

3. Investigating the long-term stability and regeneration strategies for CO2-ODH catalysts, particularly addressing issues related to coke formation and metal sintering.

4. Integrating CO2-ODH processes with CO2 capture technologies to create a more sustainable and circular approach to olefin production.

5. Conducting detailed mechanistic studies using advanced in-situ and operando spectroscopic techniques to better understand the interplay between CO2 activation, C-H bond cleavage, and catalyst regeneration.

6. Exploring the potential of CO2-ODH for activating more challenging substrates, such as methane or higher alkanes, to expand the scope of this technology.

By addressing these research directions, the field of CO2-assisted ODH has the potential to revolutionize the production of valuable chemical feedstocks while simultaneously contributing to CO2 utilization and mitigation strategies.

This review section will focus on these mechanisms, emphasizing the role of traditional oxidants and CO2, and discuss the effectiveness of various catalysts in activating CO2 for ODH of propane.

Redox-active catalysts, such as V2O5, VOx/SiO2, and Cr2O3, typically operate via a Mars-van Krevelen (MvK) mechanism [10.1016/j.jcat.2005.05.025]. In this process, lattice oxygen participates in C-H bond activation, forming alkenes and reduced metal sites. The catalyst is then regenerated through re-oxidation by gas-phase oxidants [10.1021/jp810664u]. For traditional oxidants like O2, this re-oxidation is rapid and efficient, often keeping the catalyst in a fully oxidized state [10.1021/jp810664u].

When CO2 is used as an oxidant, the mechanism becomes more complex. CO2 acts as a milder oxidant compared to O2, suppressing over-oxidation and minimizing carbon oxide production [10.1038/s41467-018-03793-w]. For vanadium-based catalysts, CO2 can oxidize V2O3 to V2O4, but not to V2O5, resulting in a partially reduced catalyst state that favors higher propylene selectivity [10.1016/j.jcat.2015.12.015]. The ODH reaction with CO2 is proposed to occur in two steps: first, the catalyst dehydrogenates the alkane, producing H2; then, H2 reduces CO2 to CO through the reverse water-gas shift (RWGS) reaction [10.1002/anie.201508128].

Redox-inactive catalysts, such as Ga2O3 or CeO2, operate through different mechanisms. These catalysts typically activate C-H bonds through heterolytic dissociation over acid-base pairs, without involving changes in metal oxidation states [10.1038/s41570-019-0128-9]. CO2 activation on these catalysts often occurs through direct C=O bond scission, particularly on CeO2 surfaces with oxygen vacancies [10.1039/D0CY00586J].

The effectiveness of different catalysts in activating CO2 for ODH of propane varies significantly:

1. V2O5 and VOx/SiO2: These catalysts show moderate effectiveness. The barrier for CO2 to re-oxidize VOx/SiO2 is 1.76 eV, which is lower than pure V2O5 but still significant [10.1021/acscatal.0c03999_12].

2. CeO2-based catalysts: These are highly effective in CO2 activation due to their oxygen storage capacity and ability to form oxygen vacancies. CO2 dissociation on CeO2 (110) surfaces has a rate-limiting barrier of 1.36 eV [10.1021/acscatal.0c03999_12].

3. Bimetallic catalysts on CeO2: Fe-Ni/CeO2 catalysts favor C-H bond activation, while Pt-containing catalysts tend to promote C-C bond cleavage [10.1038/s41467-018-03793-w].

4. Transition metal clusters: Some, like Ni4/MgO, show exceptionally low barriers for CO2 dissociation (0.35 eV), making them highly effective for CO2 activation [10.1021/acscatal.0c03999_12].

The effectiveness of these catalysts in activating CO2 generally follows the order: Transition metal clusters > CeO2-based catalysts > VOx/SiO2 > V2O5. This trend is based on the energy barriers for CO2 dissociation or activation, which is crucial for CO2 utilization in ODH reactions.

Integrative understanding and prospective outlook: The field of CO2-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes presents exciting opportunities for sustainable chemical production. The use of CO2 as a mild oxidant offers advantages in selectivity and coke suppression, addressing key challenges in traditional ODH processes. Future research directions may focus on:

1. Developing novel bimetallic catalysts that combine the CO2 activation properties of CeO2 with the selective C-H activation abilities of transition metals.

2. Exploring the potential of single-atom catalysts or metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) for precise control over active sites and enhanced CO2 activation.

3. Investigating the role of catalyst support interactions in tuning the balance between ODH, RWGS, and dry reforming pathways.

4. Utilizing advanced in-situ characterization techniques and machine learning approaches to gain deeper insights into the complex mechanisms involved in CO2-assisted ODH.

5. Exploring the potential of plasma-assisted or photo-catalytic processes to further enhance CO2 activation and improve energy efficiency in ODH reactions.

These research avenues could lead to more efficient and sustainable processes for olefin production, contributing to the broader goal of CO2 utilization in the chemical industry.
