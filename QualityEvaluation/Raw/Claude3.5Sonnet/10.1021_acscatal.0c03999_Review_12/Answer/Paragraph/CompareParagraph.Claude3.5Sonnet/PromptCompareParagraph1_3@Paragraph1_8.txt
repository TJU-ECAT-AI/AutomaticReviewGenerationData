The mechanisms of C-H bond activation and catalyst regeneration in oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of alkanes differ significantly between redox-active and redox-inactive metal oxide catalysts. This review focuses on these mechanisms, emphasizing the role of traditional oxidants and CO2, and the effectiveness of various catalysts in activating CO2 for propane ODH.

Redox-active catalysts, such as V2O5, VOx/SiO2, and Cr2O3, typically operate via a Mars-van Krevelen (MvK) mechanism [10.1016/j.cattod.2008.09.012]. In this process, lattice oxygen participates in C-H bond activation, forming alkenes and reducing the metal center. The catalyst is then regenerated by reoxidation with an oxidant, filling the oxygen vacancy [10.1038/s41570-019-0128-9]. The rate-limiting step is usually the breaking of the weakest C-H bond in the alkane molecule [10.1016/j.cattod.2008.09.012].

In contrast, redox-inactive catalysts like Ga2O3 and h-BN operate through heterolytic dissociation of alkanes and separate CO2 activation, without changes in metal oxidation state [10.1038/s41570-019-0128-9] [10.1002/anie.202002440]. These catalysts typically show lower selectivity to carbon oxides and higher selectivity to desired olefins compared to redox-active catalysts [10.1002/anie.202002440].

Traditional oxidants like O2 can fully reoxidize redox-active catalysts, but often lead to over-oxidation and lower selectivity. CO2, as a milder oxidant, offers several advantages:
1. Suppression of over-oxidation, minimizing carbon oxide production [10.1038/s41467-018-03793-w].
2. Participation in the reverse water-gas shift reaction, enhancing alkane conversion [10.1038/s41467-018-03793-w].
3. Removal of coke deposits through the reverse Boudouard reaction [10.1016/S0920-5861(03)00268-2].

The effectiveness of different catalysts in activating CO2 for propane ODH varies:

1. V2O5 and VOx/SiO2: These catalysts show moderate effectiveness. CO2 can oxidize V2O3 to V2O4, but not to V2O5, leading to higher propylene selectivity [10.1016/j.jcat.2015.12.015]. The energy barrier for CO2 reoxidation of VOx/SiO2 is 1.76 eV, which is significant but lower than for pure V2O5 (3.16 eV) [10.1021/acscatal.0c03999\_12].

2. CeO2-based catalysts: These are highly effective due to their ability to store and release oxygen, facilitating CO2 dissociation [10.1038/s41467-018-03793-w]. The energy barrier for CO2 dissociation on CeO2 (110) surface with oxygen vacancies is 1.36 eV [10.1021/acscatal.0c03999\_12].

3. Transition metal clusters: Some show excellent CO2 activation properties. For example, Ni4/MgO has a low CO2 dissociation barrier of 0.35 eV [10.1021/acscatal.0c03999\_12].

4. Bimetallic catalysts on CeO2: Fe-Ni/CeO2 favors C-H bond activation for the ODH pathway, while Pt-containing catalysts tend to promote C-C bond cleavage [10.1038/s41467-018-03793-w] [10.1039/D0CY00586J].

The proposed mechanisms for CO2 participation in ODH include direct CO2 dissociation to CO and O, and CO2 hydrogenation to HOCO or COOH before forming CO [10.1021/acscatal.0c03999\_12]. The effectiveness of these pathways depends on the catalyst's ability to lower energy barriers for CO2 dissociation and subsequent ODH steps.


Integrative understanding and prospective outlook: The development of efficient catalysts for CO2-assisted ODH of propane represents a significant opportunity in the field of sustainable chemistry. The use of CO2 as a mild oxidant not only addresses environmental concerns but also offers improved selectivity in alkane activation. Future research directions may include:

1. Designing multi-functional catalysts that combine the CO2 activation properties of CeO2 with the selective C-H bond activation capabilities of transition metals.
2. Exploring novel redox-inactive materials that can facilitate CO2 activation without promoting over-oxidation.
3. Developing in-situ characterization techniques to better understand the dynamic surface processes during CO2-assisted ODH.
4. Investigating the potential of metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) or single-atom catalysts for precise control over active sites in CO2-assisted ODH reactions.
5. Exploring the use of renewable energy sources to drive the endothermic CO2 activation process, further enhancing the sustainability of the ODH process.

These research avenues could lead to more efficient and environmentally friendly processes for olefin production, contributing to the broader goals of carbon utilization and sustainable chemical manufacturing.

The mechanisms of C-H bond activation and catalyst regeneration in oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of alkanes differ significantly between redox-active and redox-inactive metal oxide catalysts. This review section will focus on these mechanisms, emphasizing the role of traditional oxidants and CO2, and discuss the effectiveness of various catalysts in activating CO2 for ODH of propane.

Redox-active catalysts, such as V2O5, VOx/SiO2, and Cr2O3, typically operate via a Mars-van Krevelen (MvK) mechanism [10.1016/j.jcat.2005.05.025]. In this process, lattice oxygen participates in C-H bond activation, forming alkenes and reduced metal sites. The catalyst is then regenerated through re-oxidation by gas-phase oxidants [10.1021/jp810664u]. For traditional oxidants like O2, this re-oxidation is rapid and efficient, often keeping the catalyst in a fully oxidized state [10.1021/jp810664u].

When CO2 is used as an oxidant, the mechanism becomes more complex. CO2 acts as a milder oxidant compared to O2, suppressing over-oxidation and minimizing carbon oxide production [10.1038/s41467-018-03793-w]. For vanadium-based catalysts, CO2 can oxidize V2O3 to V2O4, but not to V2O5, resulting in a partially reduced catalyst state that favors higher propylene selectivity [10.1016/j.jcat.2015.12.015]. The ODH reaction with CO2 is proposed to occur in two steps: first, the catalyst dehydrogenates the alkane, producing H2; then, H2 reduces CO2 to CO through the reverse water-gas shift (RWGS) reaction [10.1002/anie.201508128].

Redox-inactive catalysts, such as Ga2O3 or CeO2, operate through different mechanisms. These catalysts typically activate C-H bonds through heterolytic dissociation over acid-base pairs, without involving changes in metal oxidation states [10.1038/s41570-019-0128-9]. CO2 activation on these catalysts often occurs through direct C=O bond scission, particularly on CeO2 surfaces with oxygen vacancies [10.1039/D0CY00586J].

The effectiveness of different catalysts in activating CO2 for ODH of propane varies significantly:

1. V2O5 and VOx/SiO2: These catalysts show moderate effectiveness. The barrier for CO2 to re-oxidize VOx/SiO2 is 1.76 eV, which is lower than pure V2O5 but still significant [10.1021/acscatal.0c03999\_12].

2. CeO2-based catalysts: These are highly effective in CO2 activation due to their oxygen storage capacity and ability to form oxygen vacancies. CO2 dissociation on CeO2 (110) surfaces has a rate-limiting barrier of 1.36 eV [10.1021/acscatal.0c03999\_12].

3. Bimetallic catalysts on CeO2: Fe-Ni/CeO2 catalysts favor C-H bond activation, while Pt-containing catalysts tend to promote C-C bond cleavage [10.1038/s41467-018-03793-w].

4. Transition metal clusters: Some, like Ni4/MgO, show exceptionally low barriers for CO2 dissociation (0.35 eV), making them highly effective for CO2 activation [10.1021/acscatal.0c03999\_12].

The effectiveness of these catalysts in activating CO2 generally follows the order: Transition metal clusters > CeO2-based catalysts > VOx/SiO2 > V2O5. This trend is based on the energy barriers for CO2 dissociation or activation, which is crucial for CO2 utilization in ODH reactions.



Integrative understanding and prospective outlook: The field of CO2-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes presents exciting opportunities for sustainable chemical production. The use of CO2 as a mild oxidant offers advantages in selectivity and coke suppression, addressing key challenges in traditional ODH processes. Future research directions may focus on:

1. Developing novel bimetallic catalysts that combine the CO2 activation properties of CeO2 with the selective C-H activation abilities of transition metals.

2. Exploring the potential of single-atom catalysts or metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) for precise control over active sites and enhanced CO2 activation.

3. Investigating the role of catalyst support interactions in tuning the balance between ODH, RWGS, and dry reforming pathways.

4. Utilizing advanced in-situ characterization techniques and machine learning approaches to gain deeper insights into the complex mechanisms involved in CO2-assisted ODH.

5. Exploring the potential of plasma-assisted or photo-catalytic processes to further enhance CO2 activation and improve energy efficiency in ODH reactions.

These research avenues could lead to more efficient and sustainable processes for olefin production, contributing to the broader goal of CO2 utilization in the chemical industry.
