The oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of alkanes is a promising alternative to traditional dehydrogenation processes, offering potential energy savings and improved selectivity. At the heart of this process are the mechanisms of C-H bond activation, catalyst regeneration, and oxidant utilization, particularly when employing metal oxide catalysts. The C-H bond activation typically occurs through a Mars-van Krevelen mechanism, where lattice oxygen from the metal oxide catalyst abstracts hydrogen from the alkane, forming a reactive intermediate. Catalyst regeneration is crucial for maintaining activity and involves replenishing the lattice oxygen, traditionally accomplished using molecular oxygen. However, recent research has explored the use of CO2 as an alternative oxidant, which not only serves to regenerate the catalyst but also offers the potential for CO2 utilization and mitigation. The use of CO2 in ODH presents unique challenges and opportunities, including the need for carefully designed catalysts that can activate both the alkane and CO2 efficiently. Understanding these mechanisms is essential for developing more effective and sustainable ODH processes, with potential applications in the production of valuable olefins and the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions.
