The literature does not provide a comprehensive comparison of C-H bond activation mechanisms for redox-active and redox-inactive metal oxide catalysts in oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes. However, it does offer some insights into the role of CO2 as an oxidant.

Traditional oxidative dehydrogenation uses oxygen as an oxidant, which can effectively decrease reaction temperatures. CO2 has been explored as an alternative oxidant for various dehydrogenation reactions, including propane and iso-butane.

The key role of CO2 in oxidative dehydrogenation appears to be maintaining higher oxidation states of the catalyst. UV-Vis analyses showed that CO2 kept surface V2O5 and Cr2O3 in a slightly higher oxidation state compared to reactions without CO2. This maintenance of higher oxidation states is proposed to be an important factor for high catalytic activities in alkane dehydrogenation.

The literature does not provide specific information on the effectiveness of different catalysts like V2O5, VOx/SiO2, CeO2, and transition metal clusters in activating CO2 for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane. It also does not discuss proposed mechanisms or energy barriers for CO2 dissociation.

In summary, while the document provides some information on the use of CO2 as an oxidant and its effect on catalyst oxidation states, it lacks detailed comparisons of mechanisms for different types of catalysts and does not discuss CO2 activation mechanisms or energy barriers.

该文献并未提供氧化还原活性和非氧化还原活性金属氧化物催化剂在烷烃氧化脱氢中C-H键活化机理的全面比较。然而，它确实对CO2作为氧化剂的作用提供了一些见解。

传统的氧化脱氢使用氧气作为氧化剂，可以有效降低反应温度。CO2被探索用作各种脱氢反应的替代氧化剂，包括丙烷和异丁烷。

CO2在氧化脱氢中的关键作用似乎是维持催化剂的较高氧化态。紫外-可见光谱分析表明，与无CO2的反应相比，CO2使表面V2O5和Cr2O3保持在略高的氧化态。维持较高的氧化态被认为是烷烃脱氢高催化活性的一个重要因素。

该文献没有提供不同催化剂（如V2O5、VOx/SiO2、CeO2和过渡金属簇）在活化CO2用于丙烷氧化脱氢方面的效果的具体信息。它也没有讨论CO2解离的提议机制或能量障碍。

总之，虽然该文档提供了一些关于CO2作为氧化剂的使用及其对催化剂氧化态的影响的信息，但缺乏对不同类型催化剂机理的详细比较，也没有讨论CO2活化机理或能量障碍。
