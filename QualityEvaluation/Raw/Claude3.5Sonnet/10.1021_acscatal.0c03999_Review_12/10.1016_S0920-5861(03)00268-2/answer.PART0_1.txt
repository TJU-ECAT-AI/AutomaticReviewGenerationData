The literature does not provide a comprehensive comparison of C-H bond activation and catalyst regeneration mechanisms for redox-active and redox-inactive metal oxide catalysts in oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes. However, it does offer some insights into the role of CO2 as an oxidant for certain catalysts.

For redox-active catalysts like Cr2O3 and V2O5 supported on oxidized diamond, CO2 appears to play a crucial role in maintaining the metal oxides in a higher oxidation state during the dehydrogenation reaction. This suggests that CO2 acts as a mild oxidant, helping to regenerate the active sites on the catalyst surface.

The study focuses primarily on Cr2O3 and V2O5 catalysts and does not provide information on CeO2 or transition metal clusters. It also doesn't discuss traditional oxidants or compare them with CO2.

Regarding the effectiveness of different catalysts in activating CO2 for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane, the study shows that oxidized diamond-supported Cr2O3 and V2O5 catalysts exhibited higher catalytic activities in the presence of CO2. However, it doesn't provide specific information on energy barriers for CO2 dissociation or detailed mechanistic proposals.

The research suggests that the ability of CO2 to maintain higher oxidation states of the metal species is a key factor in the improved catalytic performance. This implies that the activation of CO2 is linked to its ability to act as an oxidant, rather than direct participation in C-H bond activation.

Overall, while the study provides valuable insights into the role of CO2 in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions with specific catalysts, it does not offer a comprehensive comparison of mechanisms across different types of catalysts or a detailed analysis of CO2 activation processes.

虽然这篇文献没有全面比较氧化脱氢反应中氧化还原活性和非活性金属氧化物催化剂的C-H键活化和催化剂再生机制，但它确实为某些催化剂使用CO2作为氧化剂提供了一些见解。

对于氧化还原活性催化剂，如氧化金刚石负载的Cr2O3和V2O5，CO2似乎在脱氢反应过程中维持金属氧化物的高氧化态方面起着关键作用。这表明CO2作为一种温和的氧化剂，有助于再生催化剂表面的活性位点。

这项研究主要集中在Cr2O3和V2O5催化剂上，没有提供关于CeO2或过渡金属簇的信息。它也没有讨论传统氧化剂或将其与CO2进行比较。

关于不同催化剂在活化CO2用于丙烷氧化脱氢的有效性，研究表明，在CO2存在下，氧化金刚石负载的Cr2O3和V2O5催化剂表现出更高的催化活性。然而，它没有提供CO2解离的具体能量障碍或详细的机理建议。

研究表明，CO2维持金属物种高氧化态的能力是提高催化性能的关键因素。这意味着CO2的活化与其作为氧化剂的能力有关，而不是直接参与C-H键的活化。

总的来说，虽然这项研究为特定催化剂在氧化脱氢反应中CO2的作用提供了有价值的见解，但它并没有提供不同类型催化剂机理的全面比较，也没有对CO2活化过程进行详细分析。
