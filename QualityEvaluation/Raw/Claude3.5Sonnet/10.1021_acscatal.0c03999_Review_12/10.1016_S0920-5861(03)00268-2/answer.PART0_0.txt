The literature does not provide a comprehensive comparison of C-H bond activation and catalyst regeneration mechanisms for redox-active and redox-inactive metal oxide catalysts in oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes. However, it does offer some insights into the role of CO2 as an oxidant compared to traditional oxidants like oxygen.

Traditional oxidative dehydrogenation using oxygen as an oxidant is mentioned as effective in decreasing reaction temperature. In contrast, CO2 is shown to promote dehydrogenation reactions over certain catalysts, particularly oxidized diamond-supported Cr2O3, V2O5, and Ga2O3 catalysts.

The effectiveness of CO2 as an oxidant is demonstrated by the fact that activity of oxidized diamond-supported Cr2O3 and V2O5 catalysts was twice as high in the presence of CO2 compared to its absence. This suggests that CO2 plays a role in maintaining higher oxidation states of chromium and vanadium species, which is proposed as an important factor for high catalytic activities in alkane dehydrogenation.

The literature does not provide specific information on the effectiveness of different catalysts like VOx/SiO2, CeO2, or transition metal clusters in activating CO2 for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane. It also does not discuss proposed mechanisms or energy barriers for CO2 dissociation.

In summary, while the document provides some information on the use of CO2 as an oxidant in dehydrogenation reactions, it lacks detailed mechanistic comparisons between different types of catalysts and oxidants. The focus is primarily on the promotional effect of CO2 on specific oxidized diamond-supported catalysts.

该文献并未全面比较氧化还原活性和非氧化还原活性金属氧化物催化剂在烷烃氧化脱氢中的C-H键活化和催化剂再生机制。但是，它确实提供了一些关于CO2作为氧化剂与传统氧化剂（如氧气）相比的作用的见解。

文中提到使用氧气作为氧化剂的传统氧化脱氢反应可有效降低反应温度。相比之下，CO2被证实可以促进某些催化剂的脱氢反应，特别是氧化金刚石负载的Cr2O3、V2O5和Ga2O3催化剂。

CO2作为氧化剂的有效性体现在氧化金刚石负载的Cr2O3和V2O5催化剂在CO2存在下的活性是在其不存在时的两倍。这表明CO2在维持铬和钒物种的较高氧化态方面发挥作用，这被认为是烷烃脱氢反应中高催化活性的重要因素之一。

文献没有提供关于VOx/SiO2、CeO2或过渡金属簇等不同催化剂在活化CO2用于丙烷氧化脱氢方面的有效性的具体信息。它也没有讨论CO2解离的提议机制或能量障碍。

总之，虽然该文档提供了一些关于CO2作为脱氢反应中氧化剂的使用信息，但缺乏不同类型催化剂和氧化剂之间的详细机制比较。重点主要是CO2对特定氧化金刚石负载催化剂的促进作用。
