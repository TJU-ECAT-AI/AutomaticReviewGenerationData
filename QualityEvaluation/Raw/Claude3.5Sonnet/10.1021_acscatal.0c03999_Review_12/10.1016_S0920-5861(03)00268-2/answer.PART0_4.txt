The literature does not provide a comprehensive comparison of C-H bond activation mechanisms for redox-active and redox-inactive metal oxide catalysts in oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes. However, it does discuss some aspects of catalyst behavior and the role of CO2.

For redox-active catalysts like Cr2O3 and V2O5 supported on oxidized diamond, the presence of CO2 appears to help maintain higher oxidation states of the metal species. This suggests that CO2 may play a role in catalyst regeneration by re-oxidizing reduced metal sites.

The document proposes two main roles for CO2 in the dehydrogenation process:
1. Removing hydrogen from products via the reverse water-gas shift reaction (CO2 + H2 → CO + H2O)
2. Eliminating deposited carbon through the reverse Boudouard reaction (CO2 + C → 2CO)

These mechanisms could help shift the equilibrium towards product formation and prevent catalyst deactivation due to coking.

The literature does not provide specific information on the effectiveness of different catalysts like VOx/SiO2, CeO2, or transition metal clusters in activating CO2 for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane. It also does not discuss energy barriers for CO2 dissociation.

The document focuses primarily on oxidized diamond-supported Cr2O3 and V2O5 catalysts, which showed the highest alkene yields for C3-C4 alkane dehydrogenation in the presence of CO2. The promoting effect of CO2 was more pronounced for these catalysts compared to others tested.

Overall, while the literature provides some insights into the role of CO2 and the behavior of specific catalysts, it does not offer a comprehensive comparison of mechanisms across different types of metal oxide catalysts or a detailed discussion of CO2 activation processes.

该文献并未提供氧化脱氢烷烃反应中氧化还原活性和非活性金属氧化物催化剂的C-H键活化机理的全面比较。然而，它确实讨论了一些催化剂行为和CO2作用的方面。

对于氧化金刚石负载的Cr2O3和V2O5等氧化还原活性催化剂，CO2的存在似乎有助于维持金属物种的较高氧化态。这表明CO2可能在催化剂再生中起作用，通过再氧化还原的金属位点。

文献提出CO2在脱氢过程中有两个主要作用：
1. 通过逆水气变换反应（CO2 + H2 → CO + H2O）去除产物中的氢
2. 通过逆布道反应（CO2 + C → 2CO）消除沉积的碳

这些机制可能有助于将平衡向产物形成方向移动，并防止因结焦导致的催化剂失活。

文献没有提供VOx/SiO2、CeO2或过渡金属簇等不同催化剂在活化CO2用于丙烷氧化脱氢方面的有效性的具体信息。它也没有讨论CO2解离的能量障碍。

该文献主要关注氧化金刚石负载的Cr2O3和V2O5催化剂，这些催化剂在CO2存在下对C3-C4烷烃脱氢显示出最高的烯烃产率。与其他测试的催化剂相比，CO2的促进作用对这些催化剂更为显著。

总的来说，虽然文献提供了一些关于CO2作用和特定催化剂行为的见解，但它没有提供不同类型金属氧化物催化剂机理的全面比较，也没有详细讨论CO2活化过程。
