          The mechanisms of C-H bond activation and catalyst regeneration differ between redox-active and redox-inactive metal oxide catalysts in the oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes. 

For redox-active catalysts like V2O5 and Cr2O3, the mechanism typically involves lattice oxygen participating in C-H bond activation, forming the alkene and reduced metal sites. These reduced sites are then re-oxidized by the oxidant. Traditional oxidants like O2 can directly re-oxidize the catalyst, decreasing reaction temperatures effectively. CO2 acts as a milder oxidant that helps maintain higher oxidation states of the metal species.

Redox-inactive catalysts like CeO2 generally activate C-H bonds through acid-base interactions rather than redox processes. Their regeneration does not involve changes in metal oxidation states.

The role of CO2 in oxidative dehydrogenation appears to be multifaceted:
1. Maintaining higher oxidation states of the catalyst, particularly for V2O5 and Cr2O3.
2. Removing hydrogen from products via the reverse water-gas shift reaction (CO2 + H2 → CO + H2O).
3. Eliminating deposited carbon through the reverse Boudouard reaction (CO2 + C → 2CO).

These mechanisms could help shift the equilibrium towards product formation and prevent catalyst deactivation due to coking.

Regarding catalyst effectiveness, oxidized diamond-supported Cr2O3 and V2O5 catalysts showed promising results for propane dehydrogenation in the presence of CO2. However, the literature does not provide direct comparisons to VOx/SiO2, CeO2, or transition metal clusters for CO2 activation.

The mechanisms for CO2 dissociation are not explicitly discussed, and the energy barriers for this process are not provided in the given text. More detailed mechanistic studies and comparisons to other catalyst systems would be needed to fully address the effectiveness of different catalysts in activating CO2 for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane.

          在烷烃的氧化脱氢过程中，氧化还原活性和非氧化还原活性金属氧化物催化剂的C-H键活化和催化剂再生机制存在差异。

对于V2O5和Cr2O3等氧化还原活性催化剂，机制通常涉及晶格氧参与C-H键活化，形成烯烃和还原的金属位点。然后这些还原位点被氧化剂重新氧化。传统的氧化剂如O2可以直接重新氧化催化剂，有效降低反应温度。CO2作为一种较温和的氧化剂，有助于维持金属物种的较高氧化态。

像CeO2这样的非氧化还原催化剂通常通过酸碱相互作用而不是氧化还原过程来活化C-H键。它们的再生不涉及金属氧化态的变化。

CO2在氧化脱氢中的作用似乎是多方面的：
1. 维持催化剂的较高氧化态，特别是对于V2O5和Cr2O3。
2. 通过逆水气变换反应（CO2 + H2 → CO + H2O）去除产物中的氢。
3. 通过逆布道反应（CO2 + C → 2CO）消除沉积的碳。

这些机制可能有助于将平衡向产物形成方向移动，并防止因结焦导致的催化剂失活。

关于催化剂的有效性，负载在氧化金刚石上的Cr2O3和V2O5催化剂在CO2存在下的丙烷脱氢反应中显示出有前景的结果。然而，文献没有提供与VOx/SiO2、CeO2或过渡金属簇在CO2活化方面的直接比较。

文中没有明确讨论CO2解离的机制，也没有提供这一过程的能量障碍。需要更详细的机理研究和与其他催化剂系统的比较，才能全面评估不同催化剂在活化CO2用于丙烷氧化脱氢方面的有效性。
