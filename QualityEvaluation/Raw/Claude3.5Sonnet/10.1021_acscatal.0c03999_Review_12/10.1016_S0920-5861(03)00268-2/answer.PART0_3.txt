The mechanisms of C-H bond activation and catalyst regeneration differ between redox-active and redox-inactive metal oxide catalysts in the oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes.

For redox-active catalysts like V2O5 and Cr2O3, the mechanism typically involves lattice oxygen participating in C-H bond activation, forming the alkene and reduced metal sites. These reduced sites are then re-oxidized by the oxidant. Traditional oxidants like O2 can directly re-oxidize the catalyst, while CO2 acts as a milder oxidant that helps maintain higher oxidation states of the metal species.

Redox-inactive catalysts like CeO2 generally activate C-H bonds through acid-base interactions rather than redox processes. Their regeneration does not involve changes in metal oxidation states.

Regarding CO2 activation, V2O5 and Cr2O3 supported on oxidized diamond showed promising results for propane dehydrogenation. The UV-Vis data suggests CO2 helps maintain higher oxidation states of V and Cr species compared to inert atmospheres, which may contribute to their effectiveness. However, the literature does not provide direct comparisons to VOx/SiO2 or transition metal clusters for CO2 activation.

The mechanisms for CO2 dissociation are not explicitly discussed, but the results imply that supported V2O5 and Cr2O3 can facilitate CO2 activation to some degree under reaction conditions. The energy barriers for this process are not provided in the given text.

Overall, while the oxidized diamond-supported V2O5 and Cr2O3 catalysts showed promising performance with CO2, more detailed mechanistic studies and comparisons to other catalyst systems would be needed to fully address the effectiveness of different catalysts in activating CO2 for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane.

在烷烃的氧化脱氢过程中,氧化还原活性和非氧化还原活性金属氧化物催化剂的C-H键活化和催化剂再生机制存在差异。

对于V2O5和Cr2O3等氧化还原活性催化剂,机制通常涉及晶格氧参与C-H键活化,形成烯烃和还原的金属位点。然后这些还原位点被氧化剂重新氧化。传统的氧化剂如O2可以直接重新氧化催化剂,而CO2作为一种较温和的氧化剂,有助于维持金属物种的较高氧化态。

像CeO2这样的非氧化还原催化剂通常通过酸碱相互作用而不是氧化还原过程来活化C-H键。它们的再生不涉及金属氧化态的变化。

关于CO2的活化,负载在氧化金刚石上的V2O5和Cr2O3在丙烷脱氢方面显示出有前景的结果。UV-Vis数据表明,与惰性气氛相比,CO2有助于维持V和Cr物种的较高氧化态,这可能有助于它们的有效性。然而,文献没有提供与VOx/SiO2或过渡金属簇在CO2活化方面的直接比较。

文中没有明确讨论CO2解离的机制,但结果表明,在反应条件下,负载的V2O5和Cr2O3能在一定程度上促进CO2的活化。文中没有提供这一过程的能量障碍。

总的来说,虽然氧化金刚石负载的V2O5和Cr2O3催化剂在CO2存在下表现出良好的性能,但需要更详细的机理研究和与其他催化剂系统的比较,才能全面评估不同催化剂在活化CO2用于丙烷氧化脱氢方面的有效性。
