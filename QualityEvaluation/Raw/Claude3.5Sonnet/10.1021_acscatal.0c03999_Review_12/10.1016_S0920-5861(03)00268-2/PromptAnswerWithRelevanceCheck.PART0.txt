The literature does not provide a comprehensive comparison of C-H bond activation and catalyst regeneration mechanisms for redox-active and redox-inactive metal oxide catalysts in oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes. However, it does offer some insights into the role of CO2 as an oxidant compared to traditional oxidants like oxygen.

Traditional oxidative dehydrogenation using oxygen as an oxidant is mentioned as effective in decreasing reaction temperature. In contrast, CO2 is shown to promote dehydrogenation reactions over certain catalysts, particularly oxidized diamond-supported Cr2O3, V2O5, and Ga2O3 catalysts.

The effectiveness of CO2 as an oxidant is demonstrated by the fact that activity of oxidized diamond-supported Cr2O3 and V2O5 catalysts was twice as high in the presence of CO2 compared to its absence. This suggests that CO2 plays a role in maintaining higher oxidation states of chromium and vanadium species, which is proposed as an important factor for high catalytic activities in alkane dehydrogenation.

The literature does not provide specific information on the effectiveness of different catalysts like VOx/SiO2, CeO2, or transition metal clusters in activating CO2 for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane. It also does not discuss proposed mechanisms or energy barriers for CO2 dissociation.

In summary, while the document provides some information on the use of CO2 as an oxidant in dehydrogenation reactions, it lacks detailed mechanistic comparisons between different types of catalysts and oxidants. The focus is primarily on the promotional effect of CO2 on specific oxidized diamond-supported catalysts.

该文献并未全面比较氧化还原活性和非氧化还原活性金属氧化物催化剂在烷烃氧化脱氢中的C-H键活化和催化剂再生机制。但是，它确实提供了一些关于CO2作为氧化剂与传统氧化剂（如氧气）相比的作用的见解。

文中提到使用氧气作为氧化剂的传统氧化脱氢反应可有效降低反应温度。相比之下，CO2被证实可以促进某些催化剂的脱氢反应，特别是氧化金刚石负载的Cr2O3、V2O5和Ga2O3催化剂。

CO2作为氧化剂的有效性体现在氧化金刚石负载的Cr2O3和V2O5催化剂在CO2存在下的活性是在其不存在时的两倍。这表明CO2在维持铬和钒物种的较高氧化态方面发挥作用，这被认为是烷烃脱氢反应中高催化活性的重要因素之一。

文献没有提供关于VOx/SiO2、CeO2或过渡金属簇等不同催化剂在活化CO2用于丙烷氧化脱氢方面的有效性的具体信息。它也没有讨论CO2解离的提议机制或能量障碍。

总之，虽然该文档提供了一些关于CO2作为脱氢反应中氧化剂的使用信息，但缺乏不同类型催化剂和氧化剂之间的详细机制比较。重点主要是CO2对特定氧化金刚石负载催化剂的促进作用。

The literature does not provide a comprehensive comparison of C-H bond activation and catalyst regeneration mechanisms for redox-active and redox-inactive metal oxide catalysts in oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes. However, it does offer some insights into the role of CO2 as an oxidant for certain catalysts.

For redox-active catalysts like Cr2O3 and V2O5 supported on oxidized diamond, CO2 appears to play a crucial role in maintaining the metal oxides in a higher oxidation state during the dehydrogenation reaction. This suggests that CO2 acts as a mild oxidant, helping to regenerate the active sites on the catalyst surface.

The study focuses primarily on Cr2O3 and V2O5 catalysts and does not provide information on CeO2 or transition metal clusters. It also doesn't discuss traditional oxidants or compare them with CO2.

Regarding the effectiveness of different catalysts in activating CO2 for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane, the study shows that oxidized diamond-supported Cr2O3 and V2O5 catalysts exhibited higher catalytic activities in the presence of CO2. However, it doesn't provide specific information on energy barriers for CO2 dissociation or detailed mechanistic proposals.

The research suggests that the ability of CO2 to maintain higher oxidation states of the metal species is a key factor in the improved catalytic performance. This implies that the activation of CO2 is linked to its ability to act as an oxidant, rather than direct participation in C-H bond activation.

Overall, while the study provides valuable insights into the role of CO2 in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions with specific catalysts, it does not offer a comprehensive comparison of mechanisms across different types of catalysts or a detailed analysis of CO2 activation processes.

Traditional oxidative dehydrogenation uses oxygen as an oxidant, which can effectively decrease reaction temperatures. CO2 has been explored as an alternative oxidant for various dehydrogenation reactions, including propane and iso-butane.

The key role of CO2 in oxidative dehydrogenation appears to be maintaining higher oxidation states of the catalyst. UV-Vis analyses showed that CO2 kept surface V2O5 and Cr2O3 in a slightly higher oxidation state compared to reactions without CO2. This maintenance of higher oxidation states is proposed to be an important factor for high catalytic activities in alkane dehydrogenation.

The literature does not provide specific information on the effectiveness of different catalysts like V2O5, VOx/SiO2, CeO2, and transition metal clusters in activating CO2 for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane.

The mechanisms of C-H bond activation and catalyst regeneration differ between redox-active and redox-inactive metal oxide catalysts in the oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes.

For redox-active catalysts like V2O5 and Cr2O3, the mechanism typically involves lattice oxygen participating in C-H bond activation, forming the alkene and reduced metal sites. These reduced sites are then re-oxidized by the oxidant. Traditional oxidants like O2 can directly re-oxidize the catalyst, while CO2 acts as a milder oxidant that helps maintain higher oxidation states of the metal species.

Redox-inactive catalysts like CeO2 generally activate C-H bonds through acid-base interactions rather than redox processes. Their regeneration does not involve changes in metal oxidation states.

Regarding CO2 activation, V2O5 and Cr2O3 supported on oxidized diamond showed promising results for propane dehydrogenation. The UV-Vis data suggests CO2 helps maintain higher oxidation states of V and Cr species compared to inert atmospheres, which may contribute to their effectiveness. However, the literature does not provide direct comparisons to VOx/SiO2 or transition metal clusters for CO2 activation.

The mechanisms for CO2 dissociation are not explicitly discussed, but the results imply that supported V2O5 and Cr2O3 can facilitate CO2 activation to some degree under reaction conditions. The energy barriers for this process are not provided in the given text.

Overall, while the oxidized diamond-supported V2O5 and Cr2O3 catalysts showed promising performance with CO2, more detailed mechanistic studies and comparisons to other catalyst systems would be needed to fully address the effectiveness of different catalysts in activating CO2 for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane.

在烷烃的氧化脱氢过程中,氧化还原活性和非氧化还原活性金属氧化物催化剂的C-H键活化和催化剂再生机制存在差异。

对于V2O5和Cr2O3等氧化还原活性催化剂,机制通常涉及晶格氧参与C-H键活化,形成烯烃和还原的金属位点。然后这些还原位点被氧化剂重新氧化。传统的氧化剂如O2可以直接重新氧化催化剂,而CO2作为一种较温和的氧化剂,有助于维持金属物种的较高氧化态。

像CeO2这样的非氧化还原催化剂通常通过酸碱相互作用而不是氧化还原过程来活化C-H键。它们的再生不涉及金属氧化态的变化。

关于CO2的活化,负载在氧化金刚石上的V2O5和Cr2O3在丙烷脱氢方面显示出有前景的结果。UV-Vis数据表明,与惰性气氛相比,CO2有助于维持V和Cr物种的较高氧化态,这可能有助于它们的有效性。然而,文献没有提供与VOx/SiO2或过渡金属簇在CO2活化方面的直接比较。

文中没有明确讨论CO2解离的机制,但结果表明,在反应条件下,负载的V2O5和Cr2O3能在一定程度上促进CO2的活化。文中没有提供这一过程的能量障碍。

总的来说,虽然氧化金刚石负载的V2O5和Cr2O3催化剂在CO2存在下表现出良好的性能,但需要更详细的机理研究和与其他催化剂系统的比较,才能全面评估不同催化剂在活化CO2用于丙烷氧化脱氢方面的有效性。

The literature does not provide a comprehensive comparison of C-H bond activation mechanisms for redox-active and redox-inactive metal oxide catalysts in oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes. However, it does discuss some aspects of catalyst behavior and the role of CO2.

For redox-active catalysts like Cr2O3 and V2O5 supported on oxidized diamond, the presence of CO2 appears to help maintain higher oxidation states of the metal species. This suggests that CO2 may play a role in catalyst regeneration by re-oxidizing reduced metal sites.

The document proposes two main roles for CO2 in the dehydrogenation process:
1. Removing hydrogen from products via the reverse water-gas shift reaction (CO2 + H2 → CO + H2O)
2. Eliminating deposited carbon through the reverse Boudouard reaction (CO2 + C → 2CO)

These mechanisms could help shift the equilibrium towards product formation and prevent catalyst deactivation due to coking.

The literature does not provide specific information on the effectiveness of different catalysts like VOx/SiO2, CeO2, or transition metal clusters in activating CO2 for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane. It also does not discuss energy barriers for CO2 dissociation.

The document focuses primarily on oxidized diamond-supported Cr2O3 and V2O5 catalysts, which showed the highest alkene yields for C3-C4 alkane dehydrogenation in the presence of CO2. The promoting effect of CO2 was more pronounced for these catalysts compared to others tested.

Overall, while the literature provides some insights into the role of CO2 and the behavior of specific catalysts, it does not offer a comprehensive comparison of mechanisms across different types of metal oxide catalysts or a detailed discussion of CO2 activation processes.

文献提出CO2在脱氢过程中有两个主要作用：
1. 通过逆水气变换反应（CO2 + H2 → CO + H2O）去除产物中的氢
2. 通过逆布道反应（CO2 + C → 2CO）消除沉积的碳
