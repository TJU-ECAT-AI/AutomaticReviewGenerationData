Introduction 
It is well established 
that 
the conversion 
of lower alkanes 
into aro- 
matics is considerably 
enhanced 
by the introduction 
of gallium or zinc into 
HZSM-5 zeolites 
[l - 71. It is agreed that over HZSM-5, the dehydrogena- 
tion 
of propane 
into propene 
and the concurrent 
cracking 
reaction 
into 
methane 
and ethene 
are catalyzed 
by protons. 
It was found 
that the con- 
version 
of propane 
increased 
with the acidity 
of HZSM-5, i.e., with 
Al 
content. 
Recent 
publications 
have 
indicated 
that 
over 
Ga,O,--HZSM-5 
zeolites, 
additional 
dehydrogenation 
of 
propane 
occurred 
over 
Ga*O, 
[8, 91. Furthermore, 
it was shown that H, was heterolytically 
dissociated 
over 
Gaz03 
[lo]. 
Since 
it was considered 
that 
the dehydrogenation 
of 
propane 
is difficult 
over H+ but rather 
rapid 
over Zn2+-HZSM-5 
[2] or 
Ga-HZSM-5 
[3, 51, factors 
such 
as the 
zinc or gallium 
content 
would 
increasingly 
influence 
the conversion 
of propane. 
In fact, a careful analysis 
of published 
results 
[6, 8, 91 indicates 
that the intrinsic 
dehydrogenating 
properties 
of gallium in Ga,O,-HZSM-5 
catalysts 
are better 
than those of 
pure Gaz03. 
The possible 
interpretation, 
that over Ga,O,-HZSM-5 
a dual 
site mechanism 
involving 
both 
Gaz03 and H+ is operative 
for propane 
de- 
hydrogenation, 
has prompted 
us to 
reinvestigate 
the 
dehydrogenating 
activity of Gaz03 as a function 
of the zeolite acidity. 
Experimental 
Catalyst preparation 
NaZSM-5 
zeolite 
was synthesised 
according 
to a procedure 
available 
in the literature 
in the presence 
of tetrapropylammonium 
bromide. 
The 
H-form 
was obtained 
via ammonium 
exchange 
and calcination 
of the Na- 
form. 
Gallium 
oxide-supported 
zeolites 
were 
prepared 
by 
the incipient 
wetness 
impregnation 
method, 
using 
an aqueous 
solution 
of Ga(NO&. 
The catalysts 
were dried at 373 K and then calcined at 773 K under flowing

oxygen. 
The chemical 
composition 
of the zeolite was measured 
by absorp- 
tion 
spectrophotomet. 
The 
synthesed 
ZSMd 
was chacriz 
by 
Si/Al = 15. 
5 wt.% Ga was introduced 
onto 
both 
the Na-form 
(sample 
A) and 
H-form 
(sample B). Samples A and B were then calcined under 0, at 773 K. 
The sodium-form 
GazO,-NaZSM-5 
(sample 
A) was converted 
into H-form, 
by exchange 
with NH&l 
solution 
followed 
by calcination 
at 773 K (sample 
A). Conversely, 
the H-form 
Ga,Os-HZSM-5 
(sample B) was transformed 
into Na-form-supported 
GazOs by re-exchange 
with NaCl solution 
(sample 
B). It was obvious 
that during 
these re-exchange 
operations 
Ga was not 
lost from 
the zeolite, 
since it is known 
that Ga,Os is almost 
insoluble 
in 
NH&l or NaCl solution. 
Catalytic reactions 
Catalytic 
evaluations 
were carried 
out at atmospheric 
pressure 
using 
a continuous 
fixed-bed 
microreator. 
The desired conversions 
were obtained 
by choosing 
the appropriate 
weight 
ple/flow 
rate ratios. 
The reaction 
of propane 
was studied 
at 773 K with 760 torr C&H,. Feed and products 
were analyzed 
on an IGC 120 FB Intersmat 
gas chromatograph 
equipped 
with a Shimadzu 
CR 3A data processor. 
Before 
starting 
the reaction, 
the 
catalyst 
packed 
into the microreactor 
was sIowly heated 
in flowing oxygen 
to 773 K. 
Results 
In Table 
1 are listed the conditions 
of catalytic 
tests, the conversion 
of propane 
into 
methane 
and ethylene 
and the rates of overall 
propene 
formation, 
considering 
that aromatics 
are issued from C,H,. 
The rates of 
reaction 
are given in arbitrary 
units, normalized 
to rate of CsH, production 
on 5 wt.% GazO,-NaZSM-5 
{sample A). 
In order to study the role of H+ and GazOs in the formation 
of propene 
from 
propane, 
it was importt 
to minimize 
the consecutive 
oligomeriza- 
tion and aromatization 
of the propene. 
As shown in Table 1, at low propane 
conversion 
the yield of aromatics 
is small and the main product 
is propene. 
The Table 
shows, 
in agreement 
with the literature, 
that deposition 
of 5 
wt.% Gaz03 onto 
HZSM-5 greatly 
enhances 
the rate of propene 
formation 
with respect 
to HZSM-5 
catalyst. 
The rate of methane 
formation 
which 
corresponds 
to the cracking 
activity 
of the catalyst 
is very small for the 
non-acidic 
Na-form 
zeolites 
(samples 
A and B). In contrast, 
propane 
is 
cracked 
at a significant 
rate over H-form zeolites. 
It is worth pointing 
out 
that an almost 
identical 
rate of CH4 formation 
is obtained 
on pure HZSM-5 
and Ga,O,-doped 
HZSM-5, 
which 
indicates 
that the deposition 
of GazO, 
onto HZSM-5 does not generate 
proton 
acid sites [ 3,5]. 
Table 
1 further 
confirms 
that 
deposition 
of GazO, 
onto 
HZSM-5 
greatly 
enhances 
the rate 
of propene 
formation. 
The striking 
feature 
ob- 
served in this study 
is the role of the acidity 
on the apparent 
activity 
of 
GazOs for 
the 
dehydrogenation 
of propane.

GazOs-Na form (sample A) into the Ga20s-H form (sample A) a two-fold 
increase in the rate of dehydrogenation into propene is observed. Conver- 
sely by changing the Ga,Os-H form (sample B) into the non-acidic Ga,O,- 
Na form (sample B), a loo-fold 
decrease in the dehydrogenation rate of 
propane is observed. Thermodynamic calculations for the dehydrogenation 
of propane to propylene at 773 K would give an equilibrium conversion 
propane + propylene around 16% at a total pressure of 1 atm [2]. This 
equilibrium conversion of 16% is much larger than the conversions reported 
in the Table 1, which indicates that the equilibrium propane -+ propene 
is not established in our experimental conditions. Thus, the increase in the 
dehydrogenation 
rate of propane into propene by substituting Ga,Os- 
NaZSM-5 with Ga,Os-HZSM-5 
is a true kinetic effect, which will not neces- 
sarily depend on the subsequent reactions, such as oligomerisation and 
aromatisation, which occur. 
It has been shown that GazOs has an intrinsic catalytic activity for 
propane dehydrogenation 
[8,9]. 
Thus, one could conclude that the higher 
dehydrogenation activity of Ga,Os supported on HZSM-5 over the GazOs- 
NaZSM-5 catalyst was due to a better dispersion of the gallium oxide phase. 
However, it is difficult to explain how the support acidity could increase 
the surface area of the supported oxide phase by two orders of magnitude. 
Furthermore, it appears rather improbable that back-exchange of Ga,O,- 
HZSM-5 with NaCl (sample B) will drastically reduce the surface area of 
the supported GazOs. Consequently, the enhanced dehydrogenating activity 
of the Ga,Os-HZSM-5 
in comparison of the GazOs-NaZSM-5 catalyst was 
not expected on the basis of GazO, dispersion, but rather on the basis of 
a bifunctional reaction where both GazO, and H+ intervene. On HZSM-5 
the formation of propene from propane has been interpreted as follows 
121: 
C,Hs + H+ - 
CsH,+ + H, 
(1) 
C3H,+ - 
CsH, + H+ 
(2) 
Reaction (1) is slow and is apparently the rate-limiting step. It is obvious 
that propyl carbenium ions could be also formed on Lewis acid sites, via 
hydride ion abstraction. Over GazOs, we might suggest [ll] 
that C&H, is 
heterolytically dissociatively adsorbed, thus forming gallium hydride and 
gallium alkoxide species. Apparently this reaction is fast. 
H- 
CsH,+ 
Ga+-O---Ga+ 
+ C3Hs _ 
G!ax+-&--Gax+ 
(3) 
These alkoxides would decompose further to form dehydrogenation 
products and H+ bound to surface oxygen. This reaction is slow and is the 
limiting step of the formation of propene.

(5) 
When both Ga,O, and H+ are present within the catalyst, one can 
assume that the propyl carbenium species formed by reaction (3) over 
gallium oxide will readily exchange with a zeolite proton through an alkyl 
surface migration reaction: 
H- 
C&,+ 
H- 
H+ 
GaX+ 
-_d----Gax+ 
+ HZ s 
G+r----Ga+X 
+ CaH, + Z 
(6) 
This is a reasonable assumption in view of the high mobility of protons 
in zeolites, and the high instability of gallium alkyl compounds [ 121. Prop- 
ylene thus resulted from the rapidly established equilibrium: 
C3H,+Z - 
CsH, + H+Z 
(7) 
Consequently, the conjugated effect of gallium oxide and proton is 
to bypass the slow step (4): 
GaOCsH, --+ 
GaOH + C&H, 
which is replaced by the fast equilibrium (6). 
The above mechanism would account for the enhanced dehydro- 
genating activity of Ga@-HZSM-5 
in comparison to HZSM-5 and Ga- 
NaZSM-5 catalysts, and indeed is compatible with all the experimental 
findings; propene hydrogenation was not observed during a D,--C,H, ex- 
change study in the range 413 - 503 K [ 131. Similarly, in this study, 
Ga,O,based 
catalysts were found to be almost inactive for the hydrogena- 
tion of propene up to 503 K, which rules out that dehydrogenation- 
hydrogenation reactions over Ga20s proceed via a classical mechanism. 
Conclusion 
It has been established that dehydrogenation of propane over GazOs 
HZSM-5 zeolite occurs through a gallium alkoxide intermediate which 
rapidly exchanges with a zeolite proton to form the classical propyl car- 
benium ion. Propene is formed through the breakdown of this carbenium 
ion, releasing H+. Three different mechanisms for the dehydrogenation 
of propane would operate: 
(i) Over HZSM-5, the formation of C3H,+ carbenium ions through hydride 
abstraction is the slow and limiting step. 
(ii) Over Ga20s, C&l, is rapidly dissociatively adsorbed on the surface to 
produce a surface gallium alkoxide intermediate, GaOCsH,. The decom- 
position of this intermediate into C,H, and GaOH is the slow, limiting 
step. 
(iii) Over Ga,O,-HZSM-5, 
surface alkyl migration and exchange between 
GaOC3H7 and HZ are rapidly established, thus bypassing the slow processes 
L36 
(i) and (ii). The formation 
of C3H,+ on Zn++ ions in ZSM-5 has already 
been suggested 
in [2] ; similar results 
and a similar mechanism 
will be re- 
ported 
subsequently.
