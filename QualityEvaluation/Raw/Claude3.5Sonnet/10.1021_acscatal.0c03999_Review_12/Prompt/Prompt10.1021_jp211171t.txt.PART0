Abstract
Combined experimental infrared (IR) and theoretical approaches have been carried out in an attempt to specify the actual structure of the CO2 species adsorbed on the magnesium oxide surface. The interaction of CO2 with regular sites of the MgO(100), (111), and (110) surfaces as well as MgO(100) defect sites (steps, corners, kinks, and divacancies) has been investigated by means of density functional theory study. Theoretical IR frequencies compared with IR experiments show distinguishable carbonate species, adsorbed on different planes and defects, vibrating in different IR-frequency ranges. In addition, by means of thermodynamic model, the stability of carbonates as a function of temperature have been calculated and compared to the experiment. Analyzing the nature of basic sites, the results show that the most active site versus CO2, which is a Lewis acid, is not the same as the strongest site for the deprotonating adsorption of Brnsted acids. The present work revisits and improves the understanding of carbonate species that could exist on the magnesium oxide surface and gives a picture of the accessible planes of magnesium oxide as well as their surface Lewis basicity.

1 Introduction
Because of environmental questions, the interest for developing the use of basic catalysts is increasing. (1, 2) One of the main drawbacks of these basic catalysts is that they are naturally polluted by water and carbon dioxide forming, by the way of an acidbase reaction, hydroxyl and carbonate groups on the catalyst surface. These adsorbates are usually considered as poisons of the reactivity even if they can be desorbed at specific temperatures depending on their nature and local environment. (3) In order to understand the catalytic properties of the basic catalysts linked to the pretreatment conditions, it is important to be able to characterize the adsorbates remaining on the surface before the catalytic reaction and, as a consequence, to know which basic sites are available after the thermal treatment.
Such an attempt has already been made with hydroxyl groups of magnesium oxide, (4, 5) which is a well-known basic catalyst involved in numerous studies of industrial interest. (3, 6-9) The aim of this article is to investigate, by a mixed experimentaltheoretical approach, the nature of the carbonates formed by interaction with CO2 on MgO surface defects and their stability upon thermal treatment. As CO2 is a Lewis acid, while H2O or methanol used in previous studies are Brnsted acidic molecules, the discussion of the results will involve a comparison between Lewis and Brnsted basic properties of MgO.
Infrared spectroscopy is one of the more informative techniques for the characterization of adsorbed molecules, (10) as carbonate species, formed on MgO surfaces. (11-19) The literature describes the carbonates present on MgO surface as monodentates or bidentates, but their detailed pictures have been unclear so far and the interpretation of IR band spectra, and their attributions in connection to specific adsorbed species are questions, which are far from being resolved. (2) In this work, using DRIFT spectroscopy, we have followed, for different temperature ranges, the interaction of CO2 with MgO powder sample, prepared by precipitation. The originality of the pretreatment operated here resides in covering the surface previously cleaned up from hydroxyl and carbonates groups by different amounts of CO2. In addition, we have attempted to specify adsorbed CO2 species by the ab initio DFT method. The theoretical investigation of CO2 interactions with the MgO surface has often concerned (100) flat surface, (20-22) step and corner defects. (20, 22, 23) Because of their lower stability compared to the (100) surface, the (110) (24) and (111) (23) lattice planes have attracted much less attention. Nevertheless, as the adsorption of molecules such as water or CO2 can modify the relative stabilities of the lattice planes, (25) this work presents results obtained on all these surfaces and also includes kinks and divacancies, which can be formed on the (100) surface.
In the following, the configuration and energetic stability as well as electronic structures of the different carbonate species that could be formed over MgO support are investigated using DFT calculations. In addition, by means of a thermodynamic model, the stabilities of carbonates are drawn as a function of temperature. Thus, the comparison of DFT calculated frequencies and measured IR data leads to a detailed description of the surface state depending on the temperature treatment.
2 Experimental and Computational Details
2.1 Materials and Experiments
2.1.1 Preparation of the Catalyst
Mg(OH)2 was obtained from Mg(NO3)2 (Aldrich, 99.99%) solution using ammonium hydroxide (Aldrich, 99%) (8 mol·L1) as the precipitating agent. Thus, the latter was added to a magnesium nitrate solution (1 mol·L1) and the pH value adjusted to 10 at 303 K. After stirring for 30 min, the precipitate was washed several times with deionized water and then filtered. The hydroxide sample was finally treated in vacuum (106 Torr) up to 1273 K (ramp 1 K·min1) and maintained at this temperature for 2 h.
2.1.2 Thermal Treatments
Figure 1 reports the different steps of the thermal treatments of the magnesium oxide sample. During the pretreatment phase, the sample is cleaned-up for 2 h at 1023 K under nitrogen flow (Air Liquide, U nitrogen >99.995% pure) (20 cm3·min1), then cooled down to 323 K. During the treatment phase, the sample is first contacted with carbon dioxide (Air Liquide, Alphagaz, >99.9% pure) diluted in nitrogen (5% in a 20 cm3·min1 flow) for 15 min. Then, it is once again heated at intermediate temperature (473 K < T < 1073 K) in a nitrogen flow (20 cm3·min1) for 2 h. In the following, only the final temperature T that determines the degree of carbonatation of the sample will be indicated.

2.1.3 Spectroscopic Measurement
DRIFT spectra were recorded on a Brker IFS 66 V spectrometer in the 4000600 cm1 range (4 cm1 resolution, 256 scans/spectrum) using a Thermo Spectra-Tech high temperature cell. All spectra were converted into KubelkaMunk units after subtraction of the spectrum recorded on dehydrated KBr sample. All spectra are recorded in situ after the pretreatment procedure described in section and the cooling down of the sample to 333 K. Finally, Raman spectra were recorded on a Model HL5R of Kaiser Optical System Inc. in the 3450100 cm1 range (4 cm1 resolution). It is equipped with a high-powered near-IR laser diode working at 785 nm.
2.2 Computational Details
2.2.1 Methods
All calculations were performed using the ab initio plane-wave pseudopotential approach as implemented in VASP. (26, 27) The generalized gradient approximation exchange-correlation functional of Perdew and Wang, PW91, (28) was chosen to perform the periodic DFT calculations with reliable accuracy on the convergence criteria. The one electron wave function was developed on a basis set of plane waves and the interaction between the core and the valence electrons is described by the projector augmented waves (PAW) approach. (29) The selected description of the oxygen atomic core allows a good convergence on the energy for a cutoff of 400 eV. The convergence criterion for the electronic self-consistent cycle was fixed to 106 eV per supercell. Geometry optimizations were performed within a conjugate-gradient algorithm until the convergence criterion on forces (102 eV·Å1) was reached. A dipolar correction along the perpendicular to the slab was applied in order to remove the effect of electrostatic interaction between the slab and its periodic images along the z axis. The adsorption energy of carbonates on the MgO surfaces was calculated as
(1)
where Esurf represents the energy of bare surface, ECO2free is the energy of CO2 gas, and ECO2/surf is that of the adsorbed system.
Vibrational spectra were calculated for selected surface species within the harmonic approximation. In addition to CO2 molecules, magnesium and oxygen surface atoms in direct interaction with adsorbed species were allowed to relax. The Hessian matrix was computed by the finite difference method followed by a diagonalization procedure. The eigenvalues of the resulting matrix lead to the frequency values. The assignment of the vibrational modes is done by inspection of the corresponding eigenvectors. A free carbon dioxide molecule is used as a reference in order to estimate the systematic deviation between experimental and calculated νCO values. The DFT calculated vibration frequencies for free CO2 are 2366 (2349), 1318(1340), and 637(667) cm1 (experimental frequencies (30) are indicated in parentheses). As the average of calculated frequencies fit the average experimental values quite well, no empirical scaling factors were applied to the DFT reported frequencies.
2.2.2 Surfaces
The computed models representing MgO (100) irregularities such as monatomic steps (S1), diatomic steps (S2), corners (C3), divacancies (D), and kinks (K), used in this work, were the same ones that were already considered by C. Chizallet and H. Petitjean et al. regarding the interaction of water (4, 5) and methanol molecules. (31) The MgO (100) terrace (T) involving five coordinated oxygen ions (O25C) was modeled by considering a slab formed by 5 layers where only the 3 topmost ones were allowed to relax during the optimization process. Each layer was formed by 8 MgO pairs and was separated from the other by optimized distance of 2.13 Å.
The MgO (110) surface consists of alternating rows of Mg and O ions. The slab was formed by 6 layers and only the 4 topmost layers were allowed to relax. The rows were 6 dMgO of length and were separated by an optimized distance of 3.01 Å.
The MgO (111) surface was modeled by repeated slabs of 12 layers. Because we are interested here into the formation of carbonate species by interaction of CO2 with the oxide surface, we have limited our investigation to the oxygen terminated rocksalt (111) surface model. The central 6 atomic layers (including 3 Mg and 3 O layers) were kept fixed in the structure optimization process, and the other topmost layers were free to relax. To avoid artificial surfacesurface interactions, the vacuum between the repeated slabs was fixed to 20 Å. We have tested that our optimized properties as surface atomic distances and interplanar distances between O and Mg close-packed (111) planes are in line with previous reliable models used in the literature. (32, 33)
The Brillouin zone integrations are performed on a Monkhorst-Pack 2 × 1 × 1 k-point mesh for the (100) surface and defects and 2 × 2 × 1 k-point mesh for the (110) and (111) surfaces. For MgO (100), (110), and (111) surfaces, we have checked that the calculated average surface energies for each surface orientation are comparable to literature values. (34-36) As expected, the calculated surface energy for the (111) facet was found to be relatively high (5.3 J·m2 (4.16 J·m2 (34))) compared to (110) facet (2.2 J·m2 (2.18 J·m2 (34))) and (100) facet (1.73 J·m2 (1.29 J·m2 (34))). This difference reflects well the instability of the polar terminated surface compared to the (100) one.
2.2.3 Thermodynamics
In order to study the adsorption phase diagram of the CO2 molecule on the different considered surfaces, a model of atomistic thermodynamics was developed. This model was inspired from the one developed by D. Loffreda et al. (37) for a realistic description of adsorption thermodynamics of multifunctional molecules on metal surfaces.
The Gibbs free adsorption energy depends on the adsorption internal energy and on the vibrational entropy change during the adsorption process. Thus, for an accurate description of the free Gibbs energy, the vibrational contributions of the initial (bare surface and gas phase) and final system (adsorbed system) should be included in the formalism. In this work, the Gibbs free adsorption energy was calculated as follows:
(2)
where ΔEads is the adsorption energy calculated from DFT (see eq 1), ΔE0 is the zero point energy (ZPE) change during the adsorption process, and ΔSvib and ΔStrans,rot are the vibrational and transitional/rotational entropy changes, respectively. The calculated vibrational properties in carbonated systems included the interacting molecule and all topmost surface atoms. Similarly for decarbonated systems, the first surface layer was considered.
When several adsorption sites (Nsite) are available on the surface, an additional term called configurational or positional entropy, Sconfig is included in the formalism. It defines the logarithm of all possible arrangements of the molecule on the surface. Its value is given by the eq 3.
(3)
Finally, ΔSvib is derived from the reduced vibrational partition functions Qvib of the adsorbate system, gas phase, and surfaces (eq 4), and ΔStrans,rot is calculated (eq 5) on the basis of the transitional partition function of the adsorbate system Qadstrans and the gas phase Qgastrans as well as the rotational partition function of gas phase Qgasrot.

3 Results and Discussion
3.1 Experimental IR Data
The effect of the pretreatment (1023 K, 2 h under N2) on the adsorbed species over the MgO surface is shown by the comparison of the DRIFT spectra of the initial sample and of the treated one (Figure 2). The considered high temperature process cleans up the surface from almost all hydroxides and carbonates. The IR spectra (black line) shows a weak remaining absorption band at 3750 cm1, which is attributed to strongly bounded hydroxides, (5) and some carbonates with IR bands at 1657 and 1329 cm1.
Figure 2
Figure 2. DRIFT spectra of the adsorbed species over magnesium oxide before (red line) and after (black line) pretreatment at 1023 K (arbitrary unit for absorbance).
After the addition of CO2, DRIFT data show strong modifications in the IR range 18001000 cm1. Figure 3 gathers the set of IR spectra obtained after the surface treatments at temperatures T = 523 K, 673 K, and 873 K. As expected, the spectra show the formation of carbonate species, the amount of which decreases upon the successive thermal treatments. After the treatment at 873 K, the obtained spectra show the same absorption in the 10002000 cm1 range as the one recorded after the pretreatment at 1023 K. In addition, the successive thermal treatments (T) do not affect the recorded high frequencies (>2000 cm1) on the magnesium dioxide surface. In the lower frequency ranges, the absorptions are always very high due to the bulk infrared absorption of MgO with a lateral phonon frequency at 800 cm1. (38)

According to the literature, adsorption of carbonate species leads to the splitting of the ν3 stretching vibration band of the free ion, located at 1415 cm1, and gives different contributions depending on the geometry of the adsorbed ion. (2, 13) The carbonate ν3 stretching mode is split to ν3high and ν3low contributions. Generally, a consensus is gained that the more coordinated the carbonate ion, the more split the two contributions. In addition, the average Δν for each species has also been determined. (13) As reported in Table 1, which summarizes the IR results from numerous experimental studies, the vibrational frequency bands recorded on magnesium oxide surfaces have been assigned either to monodentate, bidentate, or hydrogen carbonate species. (11, 12, 14-16, 18) This table also evidences many discrepancies relative to the IR values assigned to different carbonate species, which may be due to the different states of the MgO surfaces obtained after the thermal treatment such as hydration state, morphology, etc.

In this work (see Figure 3), the MgO surface is almost free of residual adsorbates. Therefore, no hydrogen carbonate can be found on the surface even at T = 523 K (no contribution at 1220 cm1). Comparing the position of our recorded spectra with IR attributions reported in Table 1, one can assign, at first sight, all the identified bands in the range of 13701590 cm1 to monodentate species and those in the ranges of 12701390 cm1 and 16201710 cm1 to bidentate species. Moreover, two minor contributions located at 1252 and 1275 cm1do not change with the thermal treatment and can be linked to the small amount of silicon, which is a residual impurity in the sample. This attribution of the carbonate bands goes on line with the evolution of the spectra with T: the most stable species are reported as bidendate (11) and are the only ones remaining on the MgO surface after a treatment at 873 K, giving contributions at 1661 cm1 and 1321 cm1. Nevertheless, for each carbonate species, several contributions are obtained. For instance, in the infrared range attributed to bidentate species, two bands at 1680 and 1651 cm1 (split bands at 1321 and 1304 cm1) can be attributed to two different bidentate species. The same analysis can be made with the monodentate species. These different contributions are probably linked to the carbonate formation on different MgO defects. Because in catalytic applications these defects may behave differently, (39-41) it is important to know which of them are poisoned by carbonates as a function of the thermal treatment process. Modeling is thus necessary to calculate the theoretical position of the IR band linked to carbonate species depending on their topological environment.
3.2 Computational Results
3.2.1 On the Nomenclature of Carbonates
The earlier work of Fukuda and Tanabe (11) described the carbonates as bidentate or unidentate for the carbonate linked with only one magnesium ion and bridging for the one bonded with two magnesium ions (see Scheme 1). Busca and Lorenzelli (13) added some complexity to this model by considering polydentate species. The improvement in the description of the carbonates by the way of computational methods allows us to give a more precise description of the carbonates. Those carbonates should be given an unambiguous name. We propose that the carbonates should be ranked by the number of oxygen atoms making connection with the surface (ionic or covalent bonds), such connections being the bonds that lengths are less or equal to the MgO bond length in the bulk magnesium oxide (2.1 Å). Let us add that a thorough description of the nature of carbonate bonds will be evaluated through DFT electronic analysis. Thus, mono-, di-, and tridentate carbonates refer, from now on, to carbonate species in which one, two, and three oxygen atoms are connected to the surface, respectively. In addition, among a general type of carbonate species, for example, bidentate, distinctions will be made considering the type of plane or surface defect on which the interaction occurs. The carbonates will be named by the combination of a letter for each type (M, monodentate; B, bidentate; T, tridentate) and of the name of defect or plane. For instance, T-S1 will refer to a tridentate carbonate formed on a S1 step, and M-(111) will refer to a monodentate carbonate on a (111) plane.

3.2.2.1 Adsorption on the Flat Surface
The low calculated adsorption energy (0.09 eV) for a linear CO2 molecule on flat (100) terraces T confirms that five coordinated O25C ions of MgO surface are totally unreactive for the formation of carbonates in agreement with literature data. (21, 42)
3.2.2.2 Adsorption on Surface Defects
DFT calculations of CO2 interactions with four and three coordinated oxygen ions (O24C and O23C), involved in the defects of the MgO(100) plane, show largely more stable adsorbed carbonate species compared with flat MgO(100), (Table 2). Pacchioni has investigated the interaction of CO2 on regular and defect sites of the MgO(100) surface by means of ab initio cluster model SCF calculations. (42) He explained that because of the considerably large Madelung potential of a surface five coordinated oxygen ion (O25C site) compared to the lower coordinated site as the four coordinated O24C sites, the electron cloud of the O24C ion is more spatially diffuse and can easily overlap with the CO2 empty orbitals interacting with the surface.
DFT optimizations predict that the CO2 molecule adsorbs with energy values of 2.26 and 2.16 eV on the S1 and S2 step systems, respectively (Figure 4a,b). The molecule interacts with O24C ions with an average dCO distance of 1.37 Å and assumes an orientation parallel to the edge, which allows a direct electrostatic interaction of its O atoms with the Mg2+4C cations of the surface. The OCO angle is predicted to be of about 130. These results are in line with those of Olsbye and co-workers (20) who have called a similar configuration of adsorbed carbonate species as monodentate. Nevertheless, as in a such configuration, the carbonate species forms three connections (short bonds < 2.10 Å) with the MgO surface (one O2 is already inserted in the magnesium oxide network (Oβ) and two Mg2+ are linked to the oxygen ions (Oα) of CO2). Thus, we propose (see section ) to call them tridentate carbonates (T-S1 and T-S2).
Figure 4
Figure 4. Optimized configurations of adsorbed carbonates over MgO(100) defects and MgO(110) and (111) surfaces. Red, gray, and blue balls represent oxygen, magnesium, and carbon atoms, respectively. Oβ is the oxygen of the carbonate inserted in the magnesium oxide network, Oα is the oxygen coming from the CO2 bonded to magnesium cation, and Oγ is the oxygen that does not make a connection with the surface.
One way in which one can gain further insight into the molecule/surface interactions as well as the character of the bonding from the results of the DFT calculations is to investigate the change in the electron density distribution in the surface as a result of the adsorbate bonding. This can be reached by calculating the difference charge electron density obtained by subtracting from the charge electron density of the adsorbed carbonate system of both the charge electron density of the clean MgO surface and that of an isolated CO2. The atomic positions of the clean surface and of the isolated gas are taken to be the same as those of the relaxed adsorbate system. (43) Figure 5 depicts the charge density difference of computed carbonate species graphically represented (44) by isosurface contours. These 3D visualizations reveal that all relevant electronic changes are suffered by the O orbitals of carbonates. Concerning the T-S1 configuration, there is clearly evidence of three connections occurring between carbonate and the edge of the MgO step. The electron charge appearing into O2p orbitals pointing toward Mg2+4C cations indicates the formation of two polar covalent bonding. The third connection is the ionic one between (Oβ) and the magnesium cations of the oxide network.

In order to investigate the effect of coverage on the surface interactions of carbonates, we report in Table 3 the calculated adsorption energies of carbonates with increasing coverage. With respect to the adsorption energy of single T-S1 (S1 surface includes 3 adsorption sites), the adsorption of a second and a third carbonate is lowered by 1.01 and 1.94 eV, respectively (the adsorption energies are calculated by considering the surface already adsorbing CO2 molecules). Because of the strong repulsive interaction between oxygen carbonates, the second adsorbed T-S1, which has a similar geometry, adopts an orientation shifted with regard to the first carbonate. In that conformation (see Figure 6), one magnesium ion of the edge is connected to two carbonates and so tries to reach the MgO bulk octahedral geometry.

Figure 6
Figure 6. Minimum energy configuration of the adsorption of two carbonates over the stepped MgO(100) defects; as the S1 has 3 adsorption sites on the edge, the coverage is supposed to be 2/3 ML.
The calculated Hessian matrix (Table 2) of the adsorbed tridentate species indicates wavenumbers of 1603 cm1 (T-S1), 1639 cm1 (T-S2), and 1300 cm1 (T-S1), 1287 cm1 (T-S2) for ν3h and ν3l, respectively. As shown in Table 3, these later frequencies are affected by the presence of the second and the third neighboring carbonate surface (θ = 2/3 and θ = 1 ML). Thus, compared to the case of isolated carbonate, the calculated vibrations vary by less than 100 cm1 for θ = 2/3 ML and highly change for the monolayer coverage. The split between low and high frequencies grows when the coverage increases, due to the coupling between the adsorbed carbonates sharing a Mg2+ cation. Similar results were also observed for CO2 adsorbed on the ZnO surface. (45)
Considering these results, the experimental bands (Figures 2 and 3) observed around 1660 and 1320 cm1, that remain clearly visible whether the temperature is considered, can be attributed to single tridentate species strongly attached on the step defects of the magnesium oxide surface.
The modeled corner, kink, and divacancy systems (Figure 4ce) involve a three coordinated ion O23C, which interacts directly with the adsorbed CO2 molecule. On these sites, the adsorption energy of carbonate species are found to be lower than on the four coordinated sites. The analysis of the distances between Oα and the surface (Table 2) show that carbonates are doubly bounded to the surface through the network oxygen (Oβ) and one oxygen atom (Oα) from CO2. The bond character of these bidentate carbonates (B-C3, B-K, and B-D) can be analyzed from the charge density difference graphic represented in Figure 5. On the kink (the same trend is observed for divacancy (not represented)), the adsorption does not strongly modify the slab. The electron rich zones appearing into O2p orbitals indicate only one polar covalent bond between (Oα) from CO2 and Mg2+4C. The electron rich zone around the third oxygen atom, the (Oγ) of the carbonate molecule, is orientated out of the plane, and thus, that oxygen does not make any connection with the surface. On the corner, the interaction of B-C3 induces a strong modification on the substrate. The surface oxygen atom (Oβ) is strongly displaced in order to ensure the double connection of carbonate species with the surface. IR νCO (ν3hν3l) frequencies of carbonates adsorbed on corners, kinks, and divacancies are calculated to be of 17271198 cm1 (B-C3), 16791125 cm1 (B-K), and 16491149 cm1 (B-D), respectively. These resulted values can predict that the experimental band observed at 1680 cm1 on the sample treated at T = 523 and 673 K is the signature of bidentate carbonate species adsorbed on corner, kink, and/or divacancie defects. The ν3l band frequencies are out of the range of this study. As there is only one adsorption site, the effect of coverage is not considered here.
Finally, it remains the question of the observed IR bands between 1350 and 1600 cm1 (namely, located at 1516 cm1, 1423 cm1, and 1367 cm1) for the sample treated at T = 523 and 673 K, which cannot be explained by the presence of carbonate species on the MgO(100) defects. Moreover, Yanagisawa et al. (14) have already considered the adsorption of CO2 on cubic crystallites of the MgO smoke, which exhibit well-defined (100) facets, and they have not observed any IR adsorption between 1350 and 1600 cm1. This means that the recorded IR frequencies on our samples would result from different adsorption configurations on other crystallographic planes even if they are known to be less stable in vacuum conditions compared to the (100) plane. In fact, several theoretical (34, 46, 47) and experimental (48) studies have shown the change in the stability of surface orientations after the addition of adsorbates such as water. As IR spectroscopy showed that, in our conditions, few OH groups remain on the surface, we investigate, in the following section, the adsorption configurations and properties of CO2 on faceted (110) and (111) surfaces of MgO.
3.2.3 CO2 Species Adsorbed on MgO(111) and (110) Surfaces
In Figure 4f,g is reported the configurations of carbonate species formed over the modeled MgO(111) and (110) surfaces, respectively. As shown in Table 2, the most energetically stable species (2.75 eV) is formed over the MgO(110) surface. Over this plane, the orientations as well as the geometry of carbonates are similar to T-S1 and T-S2; thus, this carbonate is called tridentate T-110. Therefore, while the charge density difference graphic (Figure 5) shows a similar isosurface shape for the electron rich zones of tridentate species, the adsorption is energetically favorable, by 0.49 eV, on the (110) than on the stepped (100). The vibrational frequency calculations of T-110 indicate values at 1559 and 1331 cm1 for the νCO3h and νCO3l, respectively. This carbonate type may correspond to the species vibrating around 1510 and 1360 cm1 on our sample treated at T = 523 and 673 K.
As for the stepped (100) surface, in the presence of neighboring carbonates, the νCO values strongly vary, and the split between low and high frequencies of T-110 grows as the coverage increases (Table 3).
Over the (111) surface terminated by oxygen atoms, the carbonate lies on the surface through a single connection. Thus, the carbonates adsorb as monodentate species on the MgO(111) surface. In spite of the short dCO(β) bound distance of 1.31 Å, which is the same as that for the tridentate configuration, the small OCO angle of 115 illustrates the repulsive interactions that undergo between the oxygen atoms (Oγ) and the surface (Figure 4g). These repulsive interactions can clearly be attested in Figure 5 by the charge density difference on M-111 configuration that evidence the low electron density between (Oγ) and the surface. This may explain the low energetic stability of these species. In addition, as the carbonate presents a symmetry close to D3h, the split between νCO3h and νCO3l is very low: 1440 and 1378 cm1 (1415 cm1 for the free carbonate (49)). These values are smaller than the frequency values calculated by Allen et al. (23) who predicted vibrational frequencies for adsorbed carbonates on the MgO(111) surface in the ranges of 14401459 and 15721631 cm1. This is probably due to the empirical method used by these authors. In this work, the resulted monodentate carbonate, with a weakly degenerated IR band, could be attributed to the species vibrating at 1423 cm1 on the DRIFT spectra for the sample treated at T = 523 and 673 K. Nevertheless, the low bonding energy of 0.8 eV is not consistent with the persistence of the IR bands for high temperature treatments. This point will be discussed in the next section. In Table 3 are also reported the adsorption energies and νCO frequency values of carbonate M-111 for increasing coverage. The high coverage was not reached because of the strong repulsive interactions occurring between surface/carbonates and carbonate/carbonate species. Thus, as depicted in Table 3, for coverage of 3/4 monolayer, the adsorption is highly endothermic, and the calculated frequency values are highly different from those of single carbonate calculations.
3.2.4 Adsorption Thermodynamics
In order to get a more precise picture of the respective stabilities of adsorbed carbon dioxide on different planes and defects and more particularly, to determine the temperature of desorption of the different adsorbed carbonates, the Gibbs free adsorption energy diagram was plotted for each considered system (see Figure 7). The partial pressure is set to 0.001 Pa, and the desorption is presumed to occur when the Gibbs free adsorption energy becomes positive.
Figure 7
Figure 7. Gibbs free energy diagrams (kJ/mol) at a constant pressure (PCO2 = 0.001 Pa) as a function of temperature (K) for adsorbed carbonates on different MgO surfaces and defects.
As reported in Figure 7, Gibbs free adsorption energies of carbonates follow the same linear trend. On the (100) plane, the bidentate carbonate species that populate the corners, kinks, and divacancies are predicted to leave the MgO support for the temperature range of 722822 K. Tridentate carbonates formed on the Mg(100) steps would desorb at higher temperature and remain on the surface for temperatures as high as 908 K. This is in agreement with the assignment we made for the IR bands recorded at T = 873 K for the highly adsorbed tridentate species
The same kind of tridentate species is also strongly adsorbed on the (110) surface and thus should not disappear at T < 1200 K, but experimentally, it is shown that the corresponding IR bands (1516 and 1367 cm1) disappear from the spectrum at 673 < T < 873 K. We suppose that this contradiction may be explained considering the well-known stability of the (100) surface compared to the (110) surface: surface recombination may thus occur at T < 873 K, leading to the disappearance of the (110) plane and to the desorption of these species at lower temperature than predicted by our thermodynamic calculations. Moreover, the surface reconstruction of the (110) planes into the reconstructed stepped (100) surface (50) may also explain the enhancement of the IR adsorption at 1321 cm1 assigned to T-S1. Let us add that this reconstruction phenomenon should be confirmed by an appropriate kinetic study.
Finally, on the (111) surface, the desorption of monodentate carbonates is predicted to occur at 314 K. Regarding this result, the IR band observed at 1440 cm1 for temperature as high as T = 673 K can not be attributed to the monodentate species. Du and co-workers have attributed similar infrared recorded bands of νCO3h = 1445 cm1 and νCO3l = 1375 cm1 to bulk-like carbonates, which could desorb at high temperature. (19) Mekhemer et al. (17) have reported a similar suggestion. In order to characterize such carbonates, we have performed Raman spectra on a sample treated at 673 K. Nevertheless, no absorption band at 1100 cm1, characteristic of the ν1 Raman active bulk carbonates, (51, 52) was observed on this sample. As bulk carbonates can be present but their amount may be under the detection limit of the Raman spectrometer, a conclusion on that point is difficult to be made.
3.3 New Insights on Basicity Characterization
As underlined in the introduction, in order to study the catalysis, we need to know the nature of the basic sites available after the pretreatment step. For that purpose, the data obtained in this study on carbonate species, their nature, localization, desorption temperature, and IR vibration bands (calculated and experimentally detected), are summed up in Table 4. The new nomenclature of these species is also reported in order to take into account not only their mono-, bi-, or tridentate character but also the topology of their adsorption site.

Moreover, the literature dealing with basic catalyst reactivity shows that the characterization of the basic sites is a key point for the interpretation of the catalytic results. One of the most popular methods to determine these basic properties is CO2 TPD that consists of following the progressive desorption of preadsorbed CO2 with increasing temperature (see as an example, Hattoris review (53)). An attempt to discuss the relevance of this method has already been made (54) underlining that CO2 adsorption probes the Lewis basic character of the surface, whereas Brnsted basicity is mainly involved in a catalytic reaction. Let us remind that Lewis basicity is the ability of the surface to give an electronic pair to a Lewis acid molecule, while Brnsted basicity is, according to Brnsted definition, (55) the ability to deprotonate a molecule. It implies that all Lewis bases are also Brnsted bases and reciprocally, but we demonstrate here, in the particular case of oxides ions, that the strength scale is different depending on the nature of the considered basicity.
This demonstration is made from the comparison of the deprotonating adsorption energy of water (a Brnsted acid) and the formation of the Lewis adducts of CO2 (a Lewis acid) on MgO(100) plane defects. Using a similar theoretical approach, C. Chizallet and co-workers have established the desorption temperature of H2O from the MgO (100) defects. According to these authors, water leaves S1, K, D, and C3 defects at temperatures of 620 K, 805 K, 1110 K, and 740 K, respectively. (4) Thus, it can be seen that the strongest interaction between water and the surface is achieved on kinks and divacancies, whereas the most stabilizing sites for CO2 adsorption are predicted here to be the steps. By consequence, direct correlation between the information obtained by CO2 TPD and a reaction in which the first step is deprotonation has to be made very cautiously.
4 Conclusions
Attribution of the IR bands of the carbonates adsorbed on MgO is a very important tool to identify the nature of the active basic sites available after a pretreatment. DFT calculations combined with the DRIFT measurement on the MgO sample after peculiar pretreatments allow us to give a new assignment to these IR bands considering the adsorption on (100) defects and (110) and (111) planes. These attributions are confirmed by the thermodynamic calculations of the stability of all carbonate species. Moreover, these results give a new tool to identify the crystallographic plane and defects by analyzing the formation of the IR band when absorbing the CO2 on it. Results show that the strongest basic site versus CO2, which is a Lewis acid, is not the same as that of the strongest basic site for the deprotonating adsorption of Brnsted acids. Thus, even of the same nature, Lewis and Brnsted basic sites differ by their basicity strength scale. This conclusion should have consequences on the use of CO2 TPD when it has to be correlated with kinetic studies of basic Brnsted reactivity.
