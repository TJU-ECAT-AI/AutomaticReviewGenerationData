<questions>

Compare and contrast the mechanisms of C-H bond activation and catalyst regeneration in oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes for redox-active and redox-inactive metal oxide catalysts, explaining the role of traditional oxidants and CO2. Include a discussion on the effectiveness of different catalysts (such as V2O5, VOx/SiO2, CeO2, and transition metal clusters) in activating CO2 for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane, considering the proposed mechanisms and energy barriers for CO2 dissociation.

The given literature does not contain information to answer this question. The document focuses on propane selective oxidation over vanadium oxide catalysts, but does not discuss CO2 as an oxidant or compare redox-active and redox-inactive metal oxide catalysts. It also does not mention CeO2 or transition metal clusters. The mechanisms and energy barriers for CO2 activation are not addressed in this text. To properly answer this question would require information from other sources beyond what is provided in the given literature.

The given literature does not contain information to answer this question. The document focuses on the selective oxidation of propane over V2O5 and V2O5/TiO2 catalysts using periodic density functional theory calculations. It does not discuss the mechanisms of C-H bond activation and catalyst regeneration in oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes for different types of metal oxide catalysts, nor does it mention the use of CO2 as an oxidant. The literature also does not provide information on the effectiveness of different catalysts in activating CO2 for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane. Therefore, this question cannot be adequately answered based solely on the provided document.
