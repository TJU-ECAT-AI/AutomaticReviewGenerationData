[1] "In the redox-active oxides, a MvK mechanism is commonly observed where the hydrogen, adsorbed on an oxygen forms a hydroxide, and abstracts a second hydrogen either from a CH bond or a neighboring hydroxyl group. This forms water, which desorbs and leaves behind an oxygen vacancy that must be filled by an oxidant to regenerate the catalyst."

[2] "In an alternative mechanism, the formation of the vacancy is not required and instead, the catalyst surface brings together the hydrogen and the oxidant, which is reduced directly. This is more commonly observed in redox-inactive oxides, such as MgO and La2O3, as reported from theoretical studies."

[3] "Fan et al. have explored the feasibility of ethylbenzene dehydrogenation with CO2 on a V2O5 catalyst. They found the barrier for CO2 to oxidize the VIII site is 3.16 eV, with an endothermic reaction energy of 2.21 eV, suggesting an extremely difficult process."

[4] "Meanwhile, on a VOx/SiO2 catalyst, Ascoop et al. find that CO2 reoxidizes the site with a barrier of 1.76 eV, which is lower than on the pure V2O5 surface but still significant in energy."

[5] "In contrast, CO2 dissociation can occur more easily on the CeO2 (110) surface with a rate-limiting barrier of 1.36 eV on a site containing oxygen vacancies."

[6] "One study found a low CO2 dissociation barrier of 0.35 eV could be obtained on Ni4/MgO which provides active oxygen species for alkane CH activation."

The mechanisms of C-H bond activation and catalyst regeneration in oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes differ between redox-active and redox-inactive metal oxide catalysts.

For redox-active oxides, the Mars-van Krevelen (MvK) mechanism is common. In this process, hydrogen is first adsorbed on a surface oxygen, forming a hydroxide. This hydroxide then abstracts a second hydrogen from either a C-H bond or a nearby hydroxyl group, resulting in water formation. The water desorbs, leaving an oxygen vacancy that must be filled by an oxidant to regenerate the catalyst.

In contrast, redox-inactive oxides like MgO and La2O3 typically follow a different mechanism. Here, no oxygen vacancy is formed. Instead, the catalyst surface facilitates the direct interaction between hydrogen and the oxidant, leading to the reduction of the oxidant.

Regarding the role of CO2 as an oxidant, its effectiveness varies significantly across different catalysts:

1. V2O5: CO2 activation is extremely difficult, with a high barrier of 3.16 eV for oxidizing the VIII site.

2. VOx/SiO2: Shows improved CO2 activation compared to V2O5, but still faces a significant energy barrier of 1.76 eV.

3. CeO2: Demonstrates better CO2 dissociation capability, especially on the (110) surface with oxygen vacancies, having a lower rate-limiting barrier of 1.36 eV.

4. Transition metal clusters: Some, like Ni4/MgO, show promising results with a very low CO2 dissociation barrier of 0.35 eV, making them potentially effective for providing active oxygen species for alkane C-H activation.

These findings highlight the importance of catalyst choice in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions using CO2 as an oxidant. While traditional redox-active oxides struggle with CO2 activation, certain materials like CeO2 and transition metal clusters show more promise in effectively utilizing CO2 for this process.

在烷烃的氧化脱氢过程中，氧化还原活性和非氧化还原活性金属氧化物催化剂的C-H键活化和催化剂再生机制存在差异。

对于氧化还原活性氧化物，常见的是Mars-van Krevelen（MvK）机制。在此过程中，氢首先被吸附在表面氧上，形成氢氧化物。然后，这个氢氧化物从C-H键或邻近的羟基中提取第二个氢，形成水。水脱附后留下氧空位，必须由氧化剂填充以再生催化剂。

相比之下，像MgO和La2O3这样的非氧化还原活性氧化物通常遵循不同的机制。在这里，不形成氧空位。相反，催化剂表面促进了氢和氧化剂之间的直接相互作用，导致氧化剂的还原。

关于CO2作为氧化剂的作用，其有效性在不同催化剂间存在显著差异：

1. V2O5：CO2活化极其困难，氧化VIII位点的能垒高达3.16 eV。

2. VOx/SiO2：相比V2O5显示出改善的CO2活化能力，但仍面临1.76 eV的显著能垒。

3. CeO2：表现出更好的CO2解离能力，特别是在含氧空位的(110)表面，具有较低的1.36 eV限速能垒。

4. 过渡金属簇：一些如Ni4/MgO的催化剂显示出令人鼓舞的结果，CO2解离能垒很低，仅为0.35 eV，使其有潜力为烷烃C-H活化提供活性氧物种。

这些发现突出了在使用CO2作为氧化剂的氧化脱氢反应中选择催化剂的重要性。虽然传统的氧化还原活性氧化物在CO2活化方面存在困难，但某些材料如CeO2和过渡金属簇在有效利用CO2进行这一过程方面显示出更大的潜力。
