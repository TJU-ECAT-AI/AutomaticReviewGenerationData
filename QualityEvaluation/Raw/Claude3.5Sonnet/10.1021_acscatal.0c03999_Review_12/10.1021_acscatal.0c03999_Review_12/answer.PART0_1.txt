[1] "In the redox-active oxides, a MvK mechanism is commonly observed where the hydrogen, adsorbed on an oxygen forms a hydroxide, and abstracts a second hydrogen either from a CH bond or a neighboring hydroxyl group. This forms water, which desorbs and leaves behind an oxygen vacancy that must be filled by an oxidant to regenerate the catalyst."

[2] "In an alternative mechanism, the formation of the vacancy is not required and instead, the catalyst surface brings together the hydrogen and the oxidant, which is reduced directly. This is more commonly observed in redox-inactive oxides, such as MgO and La2O3, as reported from theoretical studies."

[3] "When CO2 is used as an oxidant, there are generally two proposed mechanisms for its participation in ODHP. One involves direct CO2 dissociation to form CO and O, and the other involves the hydrogenation of CO2 to HOCO or COOH before forming CO."

[4] "Fan et al. have explored the feasibility of ethylbenzene dehydrogenation with CO2 on a V2O5 catalyst. They found the barrier for CO2 to oxidize the VIII site is 3.16 eV, with an endothermic reaction energy of 2.21 eV, suggesting an extremely difficult process."

[5] "Meanwhile, on a VOx/SiO2 catalyst, Ascoop et al. find that CO2 reoxidizes the site with a barrier of 1.76 eV, which is lower than on the pure V2O5 surface but still significant in energy."

[6] "In contrast, CO2 dissociation can occur more easily on the CeO2 (110) surface with a rate-limiting barrier of 1.36 eV on a site containing oxygen vacancies."

[7] "One study found a low CO2 dissociation barrier of 0.35 eV could be obtained on Ni4/MgO which provides active oxygen species for alkane CH activation."

The mechanisms of C-H bond activation and catalyst regeneration in oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes differ between redox-active and redox-inactive metal oxide catalysts:

For redox-active oxides:
- C-H activation occurs via a Mars-van Krevelen (MvK) mechanism
- Hydrogen is adsorbed on surface oxygen, forming a hydroxide
- A second hydrogen is abstracted from either a C-H bond or neighboring hydroxyl group
- Water forms and desorbs, leaving an oxygen vacancy
- The vacancy must be filled by an oxidant to regenerate the catalyst

For redox-inactive oxides:
- No oxygen vacancy formation is required
- The catalyst surface brings together hydrogen and the oxidant
- The oxidant is reduced directly on the surface

When CO2 is used as an oxidant, two main mechanisms are proposed:
1. Direct CO2 dissociation to form CO and O
2. Hydrogenation of CO2 to HOCO or COOH before forming CO

The effectiveness of different catalysts in activating CO2 for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane varies:

- V2O5: Very high barrier (3.16 eV) for CO2 to oxidize VIII sites, making the process extremely difficult
- VOx/SiO2: Lower barrier (1.76 eV) than V2O5, but still significant
- CeO2 (110): More facile CO2 dissociation with a lower barrier (1.36 eV) on sites with oxygen vacancies
- Ni4/MgO: Very low CO2 dissociation barrier (0.35 eV), providing active oxygen species for alkane C-H activation

In summary, CeO2 and Ni4/MgO show the most promise for CO2 activation in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane, with significantly lower energy barriers compared to vanadium-based catalysts.

烷烃氧化脱氢反应中C-H键活化和催化剂再生的机理在氧化还原活性和非氧化还原活性金属氧化物催化剂之间存在差异：

对于氧化还原活性氧化物：
- C-H活化通过Mars-van Krevelen (MvK)机理进行
- 氢被吸附在表面氧上，形成氢氧化物
- 第二个氢从C-H键或相邻的羟基中被抽离
- 水形成并脱附，留下氧空位
- 空位必须由氧化剂填充以再生催化剂

对于非氧化还原活性氧化物：
- 不需要形成氧空位
- 催化剂表面将氢和氧化剂聚集在一起
- 氧化剂直接在表面上被还原

当CO2用作氧化剂时，提出了两种主要机理：
1. CO2直接解离形成CO和O
2. CO2先被氢化为HOCO或COOH，然后形成CO

不同催化剂在活化CO2用于丙烷氧化脱氢方面的效果各不相同：

- V2O5：CO2氧化VIII位点的能垒非常高（3.16 eV），使该过程极其困难
- VOx/SiO2：能垒（1.76 eV）比V2O5低，但仍然显著
- CeO2 (110)：在含有氧空位的位点上，CO2解离更容易，能垒更低（1.36 eV）
- Ni4/MgO：CO2解离能垒非常低（0.35 eV），为烷烃C-H活化提供活性氧物种

总之，CeO2和Ni4/MgO在丙烷氧化脱氢中的CO2活化方面表现最为promising，与钒基催化剂相比，能垒显著降低。
