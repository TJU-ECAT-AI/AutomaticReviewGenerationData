(266268) In the redox-active oxides, a MvK mechanism is commonly observed where the hydrogen, adsorbed on an oxygen forms a hydroxide, and abstracts a second hydrogen either from a CH bond or a neighboring hydroxyl group. (269) This forms water, which desorbs and leaves behind an oxygen vacancy that must be filled by an oxidant to regenerate the catalyst."

[2] "In an alternative mechanism, the formation of the vacancy is not required and instead, the catalyst surface brings together the hydrogen and the oxidant, which is reduced directly. This is more commonly observed in redox-inactive oxides, such as MgO and La2O3, as reported from theoretical studies."

[4] "Meanwhile, on a VOx/SiO2 catalyst, Ascoop et al. find that CO2 reoxidizes the site with a barrier of 1.76 eV, which is lower than on the pure V2O5 surface but still significant in energy."

The mechanisms of C-H bond activation and catalyst regeneration in oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes differ between redox-active and redox-inactive metal oxide catalysts:

For redox-active oxides:
- C-H activation occurs homolytically via H abstraction by surface oxygen species
- A Mars-van Krevelen (MvK) mechanism is common
- Hydrogen forms a hydroxide on the surface, then abstracts a second hydrogen
- Water desorbs, leaving an oxygen vacancy
- The vacancy must be filled by an oxidant to regenerate the catalyst

For redox-inactive oxides:
- C-H activation can occur heterolytically over an acid-base pair
- No oxygen vacancy formation is required
- The catalyst surface directly brings together hydrogen and the oxidant
- The oxidant is reduced directly on the surface

Regarding CO2 activation for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane:

1. V2O5: Very ineffective, with a high barrier of 3.16 eV and endothermic reaction energy.

2. VOx/SiO2: Somewhat more effective than pure V2O5, but still challenging with a barrier of 1.76 eV.

3. CeO2: More effective, especially on surfaces with oxygen vacancies, with a lower barrier of 1.36 eV.

4. Transition metal clusters (e.g., Ni4/MgO): Highly effective, with a very low barrier of 0.35 eV for CO2 dissociation.

The effectiveness of CO2 activation follows the order: Transition metal clusters > CeO2 > VOx/SiO2 > V2O5. This trend is based on the energy barriers for CO2 dissociation, which is the proposed mechanism for CO2 activation in these systems. The lower the barrier, the more effective the catalyst is at activating CO2 for use in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane.

1. V2O5：效果很差，能垒高达3.16 eV，反应吸热。

2. VOx/SiO2：比纯V2O5稍好，但仍具有挑战性，能垒为1.76 eV。

3. CeO2：更有效，特别是在含有氧空位的表面，能垒降低到1.36 eV。

4. 过渡金属簇（如Ni4/MgO）：非常有效，CO2解离能垒很低，仅为0.35 eV。

CO2活化的有效性顺序为：过渡金属簇 > CeO2 > VOx/SiO2 > V2O5。这一趋势基于CO2解离的能垒，这是这些系统中CO2活化的提议机理。能垒越低，催化剂在丙烷氧化脱氢中活化CO2的效果越好。

In summary, CeO2 and Ni4/MgO show the most promise for CO2 activation in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane, with significantly lower energy barriers compared to vanadium-based catalysts.

对于氧化还原活性氧化物：
- C-H活化通过Mars-van Krevelen (MvK)机理进行
- 氢被吸附在表面氧上，形成氢氧化物
- 第二个氢从C-H键或相邻的羟基中被抽离

- 空位必须由氧化剂填充以再生催化剂

对于非氧化还原活性氧化物：
- 不需要形成氧空位
- 催化剂表面将氢和氧化剂聚集在一起
- 氧化剂直接在表面上被还原

当CO2用作氧化剂时，提出了两种主要机理：
1. CO2直接解离形成CO和O
2. CO2先被氢化为HOCO或COOH，然后形成CO

不同催化剂在活化CO2用于丙烷氧化脱氢方面的效果各不相同：

- V2O5：CO2氧化VIII位点的能垒非常高（3.16 eV），使该过程极其困难
- VOx/SiO2：能垒（1.76 eV）比V2O5低，但仍然显著
- CeO2 (110)：在含有氧空位的位点上，CO2解离更容易，能垒更低（1.36 eV）
- Ni4/MgO：CO2解离能垒非常低（0.35 eV），为烷烃C-H活化提供活性氧物种

总之，CeO2和Ni4/MgO在丙烷氧化脱氢中的CO2活化方面表现最为promising，与钒基催化剂相比，能垒显著降低。

The mechanisms of C-H bond activation and catalyst regeneration in oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes differ between redox-active and redox-inactive metal oxide catalysts.

For redox-active oxides, the Mars-van Krevelen (MvK) mechanism is common. In this process, hydrogen is first adsorbed on a surface oxygen, forming a hydroxide. This hydroxide then abstracts a second hydrogen from either a C-H bond or a nearby hydroxyl group, resulting in water formation. The water desorbs, leaving an oxygen vacancy that must be filled by an oxidant to regenerate the catalyst.

In contrast, redox-inactive oxides like MgO and La2O3 typically follow a different mechanism. Here, no oxygen vacancy is formed. Instead, the catalyst surface facilitates the direct interaction between hydrogen and the oxidant, leading to the reduction of the oxidant.

Regarding the role of CO2 as an oxidant, its effectiveness varies significantly across different catalysts:

1. V2O5: CO2 activation is extremely difficult, with a high barrier of 3.16 eV for oxidizing the VIII site.

2. VOx/SiO2: Shows improved CO2 activation compared to V2O5, but still faces a significant energy barrier of 1.76 eV.

3. CeO2: Demonstrates better CO2 dissociation capability, especially on the (110) surface with oxygen vacancies, having a lower rate-limiting barrier of 1.36 eV.

4. Transition metal clusters: Some, like Ni4/MgO, show promising results with a very low CO2 dissociation barrier of 0.35 eV, making them potentially effective for providing active oxygen species for alkane C-H activation.

These findings highlight the importance of catalyst choice in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions using CO2 as an oxidant. While traditional redox-active oxides struggle with CO2 activation, certain materials like CeO2 and transition metal clusters show more promise in effectively utilizing CO2 for this process.

在烷烃的氧化脱氢过程中，氧化还原活性和非氧化还原活性金属氧化物催化剂的C-H键活化和催化剂再生机制存在差异。

对于氧化还原活性氧化物，常见的是Mars-van Krevelen（MvK）机制。在此过程中，氢首先被吸附在表面氧上，形成氢氧化物。然后，这个氢氧化物从C-H键或邻近的羟基中提取第二个氢，形成水。水脱附后留下氧空位，必须由氧化剂填充以再生催化剂。

相比之下，像MgO和La2O3这样的非氧化还原活性氧化物通常遵循不同的机制。在这里，不形成氧空位。相反，催化剂表面促进了氢和氧化剂之间的直接相互作用，导致氧化剂的还原。

关于CO2作为氧化剂的作用，其有效性在不同催化剂间存在显著差异：

1. V2O5：CO2活化极其困难，氧化VIII位点的能垒高达3.16 eV。

2. VOx/SiO2：相比V2O5显示出改善的CO2活化能力，但仍面临1.76 eV的显著能垒。

3. CeO2：表现出更好的CO2解离能力，特别是在含氧空位的(110)表面，具有较低的1.36 eV限速能垒。

4. 过渡金属簇：一些如Ni4/MgO的催化剂显示出令人鼓舞的结果，CO2解离能垒很低，仅为0.35 eV，使其有潜力为烷烃C-H活化提供活性氧物种。

这些发现突出了在使用CO2作为氧化剂的氧化脱氢反应中选择催化剂的重要性。虽然传统的氧化还原活性氧化物在CO2活化方面存在困难，但某些材料如CeO2和过渡金属簇在有效利用CO2进行这一过程方面显示出更大的潜力。
