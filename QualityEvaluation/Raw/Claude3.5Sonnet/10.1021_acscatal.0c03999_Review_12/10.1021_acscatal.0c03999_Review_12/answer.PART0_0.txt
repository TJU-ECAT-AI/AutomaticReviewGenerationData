[1] "In metal oxides, this commonly occurs homolytically via H abstraction by surface oxygen species, or heterolytically over an acidbase pair. (266268) In the redox-active oxides, a MvK mechanism is commonly observed where the hydrogen, adsorbed on an oxygen forms a hydroxide, and abstracts a second hydrogen either from a CH bond or a neighboring hydroxyl group. (269) This forms water, which desorbs and leaves behind an oxygen vacancy that must be filled by an oxidant to regenerate the catalyst."

[2] "In an alternative mechanism, the formation of the vacancy is not required and instead, the catalyst surface brings together the hydrogen and the oxidant, which is reduced directly. This is more commonly observed in redox-inactive oxides, such as MgO and La2O3, as reported from theoretical studies."

[3] "Fan et al. have explored the feasibility of ethylbenzene dehydrogenation with CO2 on a V2O5 catalyst. (276) They found the barrier for CO2 to oxidize the VIII site is 3.16 eV, with an endothermic reaction energy of 2.21 eV, suggesting an extremely difficult process."

[4] "Meanwhile, on a VOx/SiO2 catalyst, Ascoop et al. find that CO2 reoxidizes the site with a barrier of 1.76 eV, which is lower than on the pure V2O5 surface but still significant in energy."

[5] "In contrast, CO2 dissociation can occur more easily on the CeO2 (110) surface with a rate-limiting barrier of 1.36 eV on a site containing oxygen vacancies."

[6] "One study found a low CO2 dissociation barrier of 0.35 eV could be obtained on Ni4/MgO which provides active oxygen species for alkane CH activation."

The mechanisms of C-H bond activation and catalyst regeneration in oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes differ between redox-active and redox-inactive metal oxide catalysts:

For redox-active oxides:
- C-H activation occurs homolytically via H abstraction by surface oxygen species
- A Mars-van Krevelen (MvK) mechanism is common
- Hydrogen forms a hydroxide on the surface, then abstracts a second hydrogen
- Water desorbs, leaving an oxygen vacancy
- The vacancy must be filled by an oxidant to regenerate the catalyst

For redox-inactive oxides:
- C-H activation can occur heterolytically over an acid-base pair
- No oxygen vacancy formation is required
- The catalyst surface directly brings together hydrogen and the oxidant
- The oxidant is reduced directly on the surface

Regarding CO2 activation for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane:

1. V2O5: Very ineffective, with a high barrier of 3.16 eV and endothermic reaction energy.

2. VOx/SiO2: Somewhat more effective than pure V2O5, but still challenging with a barrier of 1.76 eV.

3. CeO2: More effective, especially on surfaces with oxygen vacancies, with a lower barrier of 1.36 eV.

4. Transition metal clusters (e.g., Ni4/MgO): Highly effective, with a very low barrier of 0.35 eV for CO2 dissociation.

The effectiveness of CO2 activation follows the order: Transition metal clusters > CeO2 > VOx/SiO2 > V2O5. This trend is based on the energy barriers for CO2 dissociation, which is the proposed mechanism for CO2 activation in these systems. The lower the barrier, the more effective the catalyst is at activating CO2 for use in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane.

氧化脱氢反应中烷烃C-H键活化和催化剂再生的机理在氧化还原活性和非氧化还原活性金属氧化物催化剂之间存在差异：

对于氧化还原活性氧化物：
- C-H活化通过表面氧物种的均裂H抽提发生
- 常见Mars-van Krevelen (MvK)机理
- 氢在表面形成氢氧化物，然后抽提第二个氢
- 水脱附，留下氧空位
- 空位必须由氧化剂填充以再生催化剂

对于非氧化还原活性氧化物：
- C-H活化可以在酸碱对上异裂发生
- 不需要形成氧空位
- 催化剂表面直接将氢和氧化剂结合
- 氧化剂直接在表面被还原

关于CO2在丙烷氧化脱氢中的活化：

1. V2O5：效果很差，能垒高达3.16 eV，反应吸热。

2. VOx/SiO2：比纯V2O5稍好，但仍具有挑战性，能垒为1.76 eV。

3. CeO2：更有效，特别是在含有氧空位的表面，能垒降低到1.36 eV。

4. 过渡金属簇（如Ni4/MgO）：非常有效，CO2解离能垒很低，仅为0.35 eV。

CO2活化的有效性顺序为：过渡金属簇 > CeO2 > VOx/SiO2 > V2O5。这一趋势基于CO2解离的能垒，这是这些系统中CO2活化的提议机理。能垒越低，催化剂在丙烷氧化脱氢中活化CO2的效果越好。
