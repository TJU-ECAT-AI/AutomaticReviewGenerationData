[1] "In metal oxides, this commonly occurs homolytically via H abstraction by surface oxygen species, or heterolytically over an acidbase pair. (266268) In the redox-active oxides, a MvK mechanism is commonly observed where the hydrogen, adsorbed on an oxygen forms a hydroxide, and abstracts a second hydrogen either from a CH bond or a neighboring hydroxyl group. (269) This forms water, which desorbs and leaves behind an oxygen vacancy that must be filled by an oxidant to regenerate the catalyst. (270272)"

[2] "In an alternative mechanism, the formation of the vacancy is not required and instead, the catalyst surface brings together the hydrogen and the oxidant, which is reduced directly. This is more commonly observed in redox-inactive oxides, such as MgO and La2O3, as reported from theoretical studies. (273275)"

[3] "Fan et al. have explored the feasibility of ethylbenzene dehydrogenation with CO2 on a V2O5 catalyst. (276) They found the barrier for CO2 to oxidize the VIII site is 3.16 eV, with an endothermic reaction energy of 2.21 eV, suggesting an extremely difficult process."

[4] "Meanwhile, on a VOx/SiO2 catalyst, Ascoop et al. find that CO2 reoxidizes the site with a barrier of 1.76 eV, which is lower than on the pure V2O5 surface but still significant in energy. (28)"

[5] "In contrast, CO2 dissociation can occur more easily on the CeO2 (110) surface with a rate-limiting barrier of 1.36 eV on a site containing oxygen vacancies. (277)"

[6] "One study found a low CO2 dissociation barrier of 0.35 eV could be obtained on Ni4/MgO which provides active oxygen species for alkane CH activation. (281)"

The mechanisms of C-H bond activation and catalyst regeneration in oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes differ between redox-active and redox-inactive metal oxide catalysts:

For redox-active oxides:
- C-H activation occurs homolytically via H abstraction by surface oxygen species.
- A Mars-van Krevelen (MvK) mechanism is common, where hydrogen forms a hydroxide and abstracts a second hydrogen.
- Water desorbs, leaving an oxygen vacancy that must be filled by an oxidant to regenerate the catalyst.

For redox-inactive oxides:
- C-H activation occurs heterolytically over an acid-base pair.
- The formation of an oxygen vacancy is not required.
- The catalyst surface brings together hydrogen and the oxidant, which is reduced directly.

Traditional oxidants like O2 are generally more effective in regenerating the catalyst compared to CO2. However, the effectiveness of CO2 as an oxidant varies among different catalysts:

- V2O5: CO2 activation is extremely difficult, with a high barrier of 3.16 eV.
- VOx/SiO2: CO2 reoxidizes the site with a lower but still significant barrier of 1.76 eV.
- CeO2: CO2 dissociation occurs more easily, with a barrier of 1.36 eV on oxygen vacancy sites.
- Ni4/MgO: Highly effective for CO2 dissociation, with a low barrier of 0.35 eV.

The effectiveness of these catalysts in activating CO2 for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane follows the order: Ni4/MgO > CeO2 > VOx/SiO2 > V2O5. Transition metal clusters, particularly on MgO supports, show the most promise for CO2 activation due to their ability to achieve low dissociation barriers.

烷烃氧化脱氢过程中C-H键活化和催化剂再生的机理在氧化还原活性和非活性金属氧化物催化剂之间存在差异：

对于氧化还原活性氧化物：
- C-H活化通过表面氧物种的均裂H抽提发生。
- 常见的是Mars-van Krevelen (MvK)机理，氢形成氢氧化物并抽提第二个氢。
- 水脱附，留下氧空位，必须由氧化剂填充以再生催化剂。

对于氧化还原非活性氧化物：
- C-H活化在酸碱对上发生异裂。
- 不需要形成氧空位。
- 催化剂表面将氢和氧化剂聚集在一起，氧化剂直接被还原。

传统氧化剂如O2在再生催化剂方面通常比CO2更有效。然而，CO2作为氧化剂的有效性在不同催化剂间有所不同：

- V2O5：CO2活化极其困难，有3.16 eV的高能垒。
- VOx/SiO2：CO2重新氧化位点的能垒较低但仍显著，为1.76 eV。
- CeO2：在含氧空位的位点上，CO2解离更容易发生，能垒为1.36 eV。
- Ni4/MgO：CO2解离高度有效，能垒低至0.35 eV。

这些催化剂在活化CO2用于丙烷氧化脱氢的有效性顺序为：Ni4/MgO > CeO2 > VOx/SiO2 > V2O5。过渡金属簇，特别是在MgO载体上的，由于能够实现低解离能垒，在CO2活化方面显示出最大的潜力。
