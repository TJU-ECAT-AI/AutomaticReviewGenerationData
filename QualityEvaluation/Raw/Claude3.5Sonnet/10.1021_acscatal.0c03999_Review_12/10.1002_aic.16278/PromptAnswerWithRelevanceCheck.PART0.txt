Read the questions and answers provided below. First, critically assess the overall relevance of the answers provided to the set of questions asked.

If, upon your assessment, you find that the answers do not contain information that is relevant to the questions asked, stop your review process immediately and respond with a single sentence: "※※※※※※※The provided answers are not relevant to the questions.※※※※※※※". Do not provide any additional explanation or background information, only this sentence should be given as a response in case of irrelevant answers.

If, however, the answers are relevant to the questions asked, proceed to compile answers for each question according to the instructions below. Ensure to aggregate all the relevant answers from the multiple answer results provided in the document, and organize them sequentially by their order number, compiling the corresponding quotes, English answers, and Chinese answers for each question.

If the provided answers' quotes are not differentiated by question, ensure to break them down and assign the quotes to each respective question, outputting them separately within each question's section.

To provide a comprehensive review, differentiate the responses into quotes, English answers, and Chinese answers for each question based on the details given in the 'Answer' XML tags. Structure your review using the XML format showcased below if the answers are relevant to the questions asked:

<questions>

Compare and contrast the mechanisms of C-H bond activation and catalyst regeneration in oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes for redox-active and redox-inactive metal oxide catalysts, explaining the role of traditional oxidants and CO2. Include a discussion on the effectiveness of different catalysts (such as V2O5, VOx/SiO2, CeO2, and transition metal clusters) in activating CO2 for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane, considering the proposed mechanisms and energy barriers for CO2 dissociation.

The given literature does not contain information relevant to answering this question. The document focuses on SAPO-34 zeolite membranes for hydrogen separation, particularly for propane dehydrogenation applications. It does not discuss oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes, C-H bond activation mechanisms, or the use of CO2 as an oxidant. The literature also does not mention the specific catalysts (V2O5, VOx/SiO2, CeO2, and transition metal clusters) or their effectiveness in activating CO2 for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane. Therefore, this question cannot be answered based on the provided document.
