Abstract
The application of catalytic mixed conducting ceramic membrane reactors show 
great promise for industrial processes to produce value-added chemicals. A catalytic 
membrane reactor combines separation and reaction in one unit and also synergistically 
enhances the membrane permeability and catalyst activity, resulting in process 
intensification. This article presents a review on the development of O2 permeable, H2 
permeable and CO2 permeable catalytic mixed conducting ceramic membrane reactors 
for methane conversion. Majority of such studies focus on the application of O2 
permeable ceramic membrane reactors while fewer applications of H2 permeable and 
CO2 permeable ceramic membrane reactors have also been reported. These catalytic 
mixed conducting ceramic membrane reactors are mainly applied in several CH4 
conversion reactions, such as partial oxidation of methane (POM), steam reforming of 
methane (SRM), dry reforming of methane (DRM), oxidative/nonoxidative coupling of 
methane (OCM/NCM), methane aromatization (MA) and bi-functional membrane 
reactors. The performance, advantages and challenges of catalytic membrane reactors 
for various reactions are summarized and discussed. Finally, the prospects and direction 
of future development of mixed conducting membranes for industrial application are 
discussed and highlighted.

Here are the question lists, in <questions></questions>XML tags:
<questions>


Compare and contrast the mechanisms of C-H bond activation and catalyst regeneration in oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes for redox-active and redox-inactive metal oxide catalysts, explaining the role of traditional oxidants and CO2. Include a discussion on the effectiveness of different catalysts (such as V2O5, VOx/SiO2, CeO2, and transition metal clusters) in activating CO2 for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane, considering the proposed mechanisms and energy barriers for CO2 dissociation.

First, you need to sequentially extract any quotes in the literature that are most relevant to each question, and print them in numbered order, separated by newlines. Quotes should be relatively brief. Do not attempt to summarize or answer questions at this stage, but simply repeat exactly what the corresponding part of the literature says.

Please enclose the full list of quotes in <quotes></quotes> XML tags. If there are no relevant quotes, write "No relevant quotes" instead.

Then, answer the question, starting with "Answer:".  Do not include or reference quoted content verbatim in the answer. Don't say "According to Quote [1]" when answering. Do not write reference number of quotes after answer. Put your answer to the user inside <EnglishVersionAnswer></EnglishVersionAnswer> XML tags. Output formatted text, with line breaks for each question.Separate quotes and answers with a blank line. Provide the answers to all questions in English. After completing the English answers, translate all those answers into Chinese and provide the Chinese version inside <ChineseVersionAnswer></ChineseVersionAnswer> XML tags.

Thus, the format of your overall response should look like what's shown between the <example></example> tags.  Make sure to follow the formatting and spacing exactly.
