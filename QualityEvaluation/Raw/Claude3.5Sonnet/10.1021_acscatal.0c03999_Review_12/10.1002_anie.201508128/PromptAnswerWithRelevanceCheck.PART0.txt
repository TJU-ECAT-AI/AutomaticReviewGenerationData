[1] "ODH of ethane with CO2 as a mild oxidant is proposed to occur through a Mars-van-Krevelen-type mechanism, where the catalyst first dehydrogenates ethane into ethylene and H2, then H2 reduces CO2 to CO through the reverse water-gas shift (RWGS) reaction, producing H2O as a byproduct."

[2] "To help mitigate the high deactivation over Mo2C/γ-Al2O3, a small amount of H2 (5vol%) was added to the reaction feed to remove inactive oxide species to complete the catalytic cycle and restore some of the active carbidic phase, leading to higher activity"

[3] "Pt/CeO2 and Mo2C-based catalysts have been evaluated to catalytically control the products of CO2 reduction by ethane to produce either synthesis gas or ethylene, respectively. Results of this study indicate that Pt/CeO2 is a promising catalyst to produce synthesis gas, while Mo2C/γ-Al2O3 preserves the CC bond of ethane to produce ethylene, although the catalyst deactivates."

The literature does not provide a comprehensive comparison of C-H bond activation mechanisms and catalyst regeneration for redox-active and redox-inactive metal oxide catalysts in oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of alkanes. However, it does offer some insights into the use of CO2 as an oxidant and the behavior of specific catalysts.

For CO2-mediated ODH, a Mars-van-Krevelen-type mechanism is proposed. In this mechanism, the catalyst first dehydrogenates the alkane (in this case, ethane) to produce the alkene (ethylene) and H2. Then, the H2 reduces CO2 to CO through the reverse water-gas shift reaction, producing H2O as a byproduct.

The study focuses on two types of catalysts: Pt/CeO2 and Mo2C-based catalysts. Pt/CeO2 was found to be effective in producing synthesis gas (CO + H2) through the reforming reaction, while Mo2C/γ-Al2O3 was more selective in preserving the C-C bond to produce ethylene.

Regarding catalyst regeneration, the study mentions that for Mo2C/γ-Al2O3, which suffers from high deactivation, adding a small amount of H2 (5 vol%) to the reaction feed helps remove inactive oxide species. This completes the catalytic cycle and restores some of the active carbidic phase, leading to higher activity.

The effectiveness of different catalysts in activating CO2 for ODH of propane is not directly addressed in this literature. The study focuses on ethane rather than propane, and does not discuss V2O5, VOx/SiO2, or transition metal clusters. However, it does mention that CeO2-based materials have a relatively high activity toward CO2, as evidenced by the lower activation barrier of CO2 over Pt/CeO2.

The literature does not provide specific information on the proposed mechanisms and energy barriers for CO2 dissociation over different catalysts. Further research would be needed to fully address these aspects of the question.

虽然这篇文献没有全面比较氧化还原活性和氧化还原非活性金属氧化物催化剂在烷烃氧化脱氢(ODH)中的C-H键活化机理和催化剂再生，但它确实提供了一些关于使用CO2作为氧化剂和特定催化剂行为的见解。

对于CO2介导的ODH，提出了一种Mars-van-Krevelen型机理。在这种机理中，催化剂首先使烷烃（在本例中为乙烷）脱氢产生烯烃（乙烯）和H2。然后，H2通过逆水气变换反应将CO2还原为CO，同时产生H2O作为副产品。

该研究主要关注两类催化剂：Pt/CeO2和基于Mo2C的催化剂。研究发现，Pt/CeO2在通过重整反应生产合成气（CO + H2）方面效果显著，而Mo2C/γ-Al2O3则更倾向于保持C-C键以产生乙烯。

关于催化剂再生，研究提到对于存在高失活性的Mo2C/γ-Al2O3，向反应进料中添加少量H2（5体积%）有助于去除无活性的氧化物物种。这完成了催化循环并恢复了部分活性碳化物相，从而提高了活性。

文献中没有直接讨论不同催化剂在活化CO2用于丙烷ODH方面的效果。该研究主要关注乙烷而非丙烷，也没有讨论V2O5、VOx/SiO2或过渡金属团簇。然而，它确实提到基于CeO2的材料对CO2具有相对较高的活性，这从Pt/CeO2上CO2较低的活化能障可以看出。

文献没有提供不同催化剂上CO2解离的具体机理和能量障碍信息。要全面解答这些问题的方面，需要进行更多的研究。

The literature provided does not contain sufficient information to fully compare and contrast the mechanisms of C-H bond activation and catalyst regeneration in oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes for redox-active and redox-inactive metal oxide catalysts. However, some relevant information can be extracted and discussed.

For CO2-based oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH), the literature suggests a Mars-van-Krevelen-type mechanism. In this process, the catalyst first dehydrogenates the alkane (in this case, ethane) to produce the corresponding alkene (ethylene) and H2. Then, the H2 reduces CO2 to CO through the reverse water-gas shift reaction, with H2O as a byproduct.

The effectiveness of different catalysts in activating CO2 for ODH of propane is not directly addressed in the given literature. However, the study focuses on ethane ODH using Mo2C-based and Pt-based catalysts. Mo2C/γ-Al2O3 showed selectivity towards ethylene production, while Pt/CeO2 favored the reforming reaction to produce synthesis gas.

Regarding catalyst regeneration, the literature mentions that for Mo2C/γ-Al2O3, adding a small amount of H2 (5 vol%) to the reaction feed helps remove inactive oxide species and restore the active carbidic phase, leading to higher activity. This suggests that hydrogen plays a role in regenerating the catalyst by reducing oxidized species.

The study also highlights that CO2 can lead to catalyst deactivation, particularly for Mo2C-based catalysts. Pure CO2 treatment completely oxidizes Mo2C, forming an oxycarbide phase. While this phase is necessary for ethane dehydrogenation, it also contributes to catalyst deactivation.

It's important to note that the literature doesn't provide specific information on V2O5, VOx/SiO2, or transition metal clusters for CO2 activation in propane ODH. The energy barriers for CO2 dissociation are also not discussed in detail for the catalysts mentioned.

提供的文献中没有足够的信息来全面比较和对比氧化还原活性和氧化还原非活性金属氧化物催化剂在烷烃氧化脱氢中C-H键活化和催化剂再生的机理。然而，可以提取和讨论一些相关信息。

对于基于CO2的氧化脱氢(ODH)，文献提出了一种Mars-van-Krevelen型机理。在这个过程中，催化剂首先使烷烃(在这种情况下是乙烷)脱氢，产生相应的烯烃(乙烯)和H2。然后，H2通过逆水气变换反应将CO2还原为CO，副产物是H2O。

文献中没有直接讨论不同催化剂在活化CO2用于丙烷ODH方面的有效性。然而，这项研究主要集中在使用Mo2C基和Pt基催化剂进行乙烷ODH。Mo2C/γ-Al2O3表现出对乙烯生产的选择性，而Pt/CeO2则倾向于重整反应，生产合成气。

关于催化剂再生，文献提到对于Mo2C/γ-Al2O3，在反应进料中添加少量H2(5体积%)有助于去除无活性的氧化物物种，恢复活性碳化物相，从而提高活性。这表明氢在通过还原氧化物物种来再生催化剂方面起着作用。

研究还强调，CO2可能导致催化剂失活，特别是对于Mo2C基催化剂。纯CO2处理会完全氧化Mo2C，形成氧碳化物相。虽然这个相对乙烷脱氢是必要的，但它也会导致催化剂失活。

需要注意的是，文献中没有提供关于V2O5、VOx/SiO2或过渡金属簇在丙烷ODH中CO2活化的具体信息。对于所提到的催化剂，CO2解离的能量壁垒也没有详细讨论。

The mechanisms of C-H bond activation and catalyst regeneration in oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of alkanes differ between redox-active and redox-inactive metal oxide catalysts.

For redox-active catalysts like V2O5 and CeO2, the Mars-van Krevelen mechanism is typically proposed. In this mechanism, lattice oxygen from the catalyst activates the C-H bond, forming the dehydrogenated product and leaving an oxygen vacancy. This vacancy is then refilled by the oxidant.

When using traditional oxidants like O2, the oxygen vacancy is directly replenished. However, when using CO2 as the oxidant, an additional step is required. CO2 first dissociates on the catalyst surface, providing oxygen to fill the vacancy and producing CO as a byproduct. This process often involves the reverse water-gas shift reaction.

Redox-inactive catalysts, such as some supported metal catalysts, typically operate through a different mechanism. They may activate C-H bonds through direct interaction with the metal site, without involving lattice oxygen.

For catalyst regeneration, redox-active catalysts using CO2 as an oxidant face challenges due to the stability of the CO2 molecule. The effectiveness of different catalysts in activating CO2 for ODH varies:

1. CeO2-based catalysts show promise due to their high oxygen mobility and ability to activate CO2.
2. Transition metal clusters, particularly Pt-based catalysts, demonstrate high activity for CO2 activation and reforming reactions.
3. Mo2C-based catalysts show selectivity towards ethylene production but face deactivation issues due to oxidation by CO2.

The energy barriers for CO2 dissociation play a crucial role in determining catalyst effectiveness. Catalysts that can lower this barrier while maintaining selectivity towards the desired products are most effective.

It's important to note that while CO2 can serve as a mild oxidant, it often leads to lower overall conversion compared to traditional oxidants like O2. This is due to the higher stability of CO2 and the additional energy required for its activation.

Catalyst deactivation is a significant challenge in these systems, often caused by coke formation or over-oxidation of the catalyst. Strategies to mitigate deactivation include adding small amounts of H2 to the feed to remove inactive oxide species and restore the active phase of the catalyst.

In summary, the choice of catalyst and oxidant significantly impacts the mechanism and effectiveness of C-H bond activation and catalyst regeneration in ODH reactions. While CO2 offers potential environmental benefits as an oxidant, its use introduces additional complexities in catalyst design and reaction engineering.

烷烃氧化脱氢（ODH）反应中，C-H键活化和催化剂再生的机理在氧化还原活性和非氧化还原活性金属氧化物催化剂之间存在差异。

对于V2O5和CeO2等氧化还原活性催化剂，通常提出Mars-van Krevelen机理。在这种机理中，催化剂的晶格氧活化C-H键，形成脱氢产物并留下氧空位。然后，这个空位被氧化剂重新填充。

当使用O2等传统氧化剂时，氧空位直接被补充。但是，当使用CO2作为氧化剂时，需要一个额外的步骤。CO2首先在催化剂表面解离，提供氧来填充空位，并产生CO作为副产物。这个过程通常涉及逆水气变换反应。

某些负载金属催化剂等非氧化还原活性催化剂通常通过不同的机理运作。它们可能通过与金属位点的直接相互作用来活化C-H键，而不涉及晶格氧。

对于催化剂再生，使用CO2作为氧化剂的氧化还原活性催化剂面临挑战，这是由于CO2分子的稳定性。不同催化剂在活化CO2用于ODH方面的有效性各不相同：

1. 基于CeO2的催化剂由于其高氧移动性和活化CO2的能力而显示出潜力。
2. 过渡金属簇，特别是基于Pt的催化剂，表现出对CO2活化和重整反应的高活性。
3. 基于Mo2C的催化剂对乙烯生产表现出选择性，但由于CO2的氧化作用面临失活问题。

CO2解离的能量障碍在决定催化剂有效性方面起着关键作用。能够降低这一障碍同时保持对所需产物选择性的催化剂最为有效。

值得注意的是，虽然CO2可以作为温和的氧化剂，但与O2等传统氧化剂相比，它通常导致较低的总体转化率。这是由于CO2的稳定性更高，其活化需要额外的能量。

催化剂失活是这些系统中的一个重大挑战，通常由焦炭形成或催化剂过度氧化引起。缓解失活的策略包括向进料中添加少量H2以去除无活性的氧化物物种，并恢复催化剂的活性相。

总之，催化剂和氧化剂的选择显著影响ODH反应中C-H键活化和催化剂再生的机理和有效性。虽然CO2作为氧化剂提供了潜在的环境效益，但其使用在催化剂设计和反应工程方面引入了额外的复杂性。

The mechanisms of C-H bond activation and catalyst regeneration in oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of alkanes differ between redox-active and redox-inactive metal oxide catalysts. For redox-active catalysts, the Mars-van Krevelen mechanism is typically involved, where lattice oxygen participates in the reaction. The catalyst first dehydrogenates the alkane, then the reduced catalyst is re-oxidized by the oxidant.

When using CO2 as an oxidant, the mechanism is slightly different. CO2 acts as a mild oxidant, and the reaction proceeds through a two-step process. First, the catalyst dehydrogenates the alkane (e.g., ethane to ethylene), producing H2. Then, the H2 reduces CO2 to CO through the reverse water-gas shift reaction, regenerating the catalyst and producing water as a byproduct.

For redox-inactive catalysts, the mechanism is less clear, but it likely involves surface-mediated reactions rather than lattice oxygen participation.

Regarding catalyst effectiveness, the literature focuses on Mo2C and Pt-based catalysts rather than V2O5, VOx/SiO2, or CeO2 for CO2 activation in ODH of propane. However, it does discuss Mo2C and Pt catalysts for ethane ODH with CO2.

Mo2C-based catalysts show promise for preserving the C-C bond and producing ethylene, but they suffer from deactivation. The deactivation is partly due to the formation of an oxycarbide phase from CO2 adsorption, which is necessary for ethane dehydrogenation but also contributes to catalyst deactivation. Adding a small amount of H2 to the reaction feed can help mitigate this deactivation by removing inactive oxide species and restoring the active carbidic phase.

Pt-based catalysts, particularly Pt/CeO2, are more effective for producing synthesis gas (CO + H2) through reforming rather than ODH. This is due to the lower activation barrier for CO2 on Pt/CeO2 compared to ethane.

The energy barriers for CO2 dissociation and C-H bond activation vary depending on the catalyst. On Pt/CeO2, the activation barriers are 16.0 kcal/mol for CO2 and 21.6 kcal/mol for ethane. On Mo2C/γ-Al2O3, the values are 19.5 kcal/mol for CO2 and 17.5 kcal/mol for ethane. These differences in activation barriers contribute to the different product selectivities observed for these catalysts.

烷烃氧化脱氢(ODH)中C-H键活化和催化剂再生的机理在氧化还原活性和非氧化还原活性金属氧化物催化剂之间存在差异。对于氧化还原活性催化剂，通常涉及Mars-van Krevelen机理，其中晶格氧参与反应。催化剂首先使烷烃脱氢，然后还原的催化剂被氧化剂重新氧化。

当使用CO2作为氧化剂时，机理略有不同。CO2作为温和的氧化剂，反应通过两步过程进行。首先，催化剂使烷烃（如乙烷到乙烯）脱氢，产生H2。然后，H2通过逆水气变换反应将CO2还原为CO，再生催化剂并产生水作为副产品。

对于非氧化还原活性催化剂，机理不太清楚，但可能涉及表面介导的反应，而不是晶格氧的参与。

关于催化剂效果，文献主要关注Mo2C和基于Pt的催化剂，而不是V2O5、VOx/SiO2或CeO2在丙烷ODH中的CO2活化。然而，它确实讨论了Mo2C和Pt催化剂用于CO2存在下的乙烷ODH。

基于Mo2C的催化剂在保持C-C键和生产乙烯方面显示出前景，但它们会发生失活。失活部分是由于CO2吸附形成氧碳化物相，这对乙烷脱氢是必要的，但也导致催化剂失活。向反应进料中添加少量H2可以帮助减轻这种失活，通过移除无活性的氧化物物种和恢复活性碳化物相。

基于Pt的催化剂，特别是Pt/CeO2，通过重整而不是ODH更有效地生产合成气（CO + H2）。这是由于Pt/CeO2上CO2的活化能垒比乙烷低。

CO2解离和C-H键活化的能垒因催化剂而异。在Pt/CeO2上，CO2的活化能垒为16.0 kcal/mol，乙烷为21.6 kcal/mol。在Mo2C/γ-Al2O3上，CO2的值为19.5 kcal/mol，乙烷为17.5 kcal/mol。这些活化能垒的差异导致了这些催化剂观察到的不同产物选择性。
