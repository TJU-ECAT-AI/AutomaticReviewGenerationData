[1] "ODH of ethane with CO2 as a mild oxidant is proposed to occur through a Mars-van-Krevelen-type mechanism, where the catalyst first dehydrogenates ethane into ethylene and H2, then H2 reduces CO2 to CO through the reverse water-gas shift (RWGS) reaction, producing H2O as a byproduct."

[2] "To help mitigate the high deactivation over Mo2C/γ-Al2O3, a small amount of H2 (5vol%) was added to the reaction feed to remove inactive oxide species to complete the catalytic cycle and restore some of the active carbidic phase, leading to higher activity"

[3] "Treatment in pure CO2, however, completely oxidizes Mo2C. Therefore, the adsorbed O from CO2 is necessary to form an oxycarbide phase, which dehydrogenates ethane, but also likely contributes, at least partially, to the deactivation seen over Mo2C-based catalysts."

[4] "DFT was also used to calculate the enthalpy change for the oxidative CC and CH bond cleavage of ethane on Pt(111) and Mo2C(001) surfaces."

[5] "Over Mo2C(001), the atomic hydrogen prefers to recombine and desorb from the surface in the form of hydrogen gas."

The mechanisms of C-H bond activation and catalyst regeneration in oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of alkanes differ between redox-active and redox-inactive metal oxide catalysts. For redox-active catalysts, the Mars-van Krevelen mechanism is typically involved, where lattice oxygen participates in the reaction. The catalyst first dehydrogenates the alkane, then the reduced catalyst is re-oxidized by the oxidant.

When using CO2 as an oxidant, the mechanism is slightly different. CO2 acts as a mild oxidant, and the reaction proceeds through a two-step process. First, the catalyst dehydrogenates the alkane (e.g., ethane to ethylene), producing H2. Then, the H2 reduces CO2 to CO through the reverse water-gas shift reaction, regenerating the catalyst and producing water as a byproduct.

For redox-inactive catalysts, the mechanism is less clear, but it likely involves surface-mediated reactions rather than lattice oxygen participation.

Regarding catalyst effectiveness, the literature focuses on Mo2C and Pt-based catalysts rather than V2O5, VOx/SiO2, or CeO2 for CO2 activation in ODH of propane. However, it does discuss Mo2C and Pt catalysts for ethane ODH with CO2.

Mo2C-based catalysts show promise for preserving the C-C bond and producing ethylene, but they suffer from deactivation. The deactivation is partly due to the formation of an oxycarbide phase from CO2 adsorption, which is necessary for ethane dehydrogenation but also contributes to catalyst deactivation. Adding a small amount of H2 to the reaction feed can help mitigate this deactivation by removing inactive oxide species and restoring the active carbidic phase.

Pt-based catalysts, particularly Pt/CeO2, are more effective for producing synthesis gas (CO + H2) through reforming rather than ODH. This is due to the lower activation barrier for CO2 on Pt/CeO2 compared to ethane.

The energy barriers for CO2 dissociation and C-H bond activation vary depending on the catalyst. On Pt/CeO2, the activation barriers are 16.0 kcal/mol for CO2 and 21.6 kcal/mol for ethane. On Mo2C/γ-Al2O3, the values are 19.5 kcal/mol for CO2 and 17.5 kcal/mol for ethane. These differences in activation barriers contribute to the different product selectivities observed for these catalysts.

烷烃氧化脱氢(ODH)中C-H键活化和催化剂再生的机理在氧化还原活性和非氧化还原活性金属氧化物催化剂之间存在差异。对于氧化还原活性催化剂，通常涉及Mars-van Krevelen机理，其中晶格氧参与反应。催化剂首先使烷烃脱氢，然后还原的催化剂被氧化剂重新氧化。

当使用CO2作为氧化剂时，机理略有不同。CO2作为温和的氧化剂，反应通过两步过程进行。首先，催化剂使烷烃（如乙烷到乙烯）脱氢，产生H2。然后，H2通过逆水气变换反应将CO2还原为CO，再生催化剂并产生水作为副产品。

对于非氧化还原活性催化剂，机理不太清楚，但可能涉及表面介导的反应，而不是晶格氧的参与。

关于催化剂效果，文献主要关注Mo2C和基于Pt的催化剂，而不是V2O5、VOx/SiO2或CeO2在丙烷ODH中的CO2活化。然而，它确实讨论了Mo2C和Pt催化剂用于CO2存在下的乙烷ODH。

基于Mo2C的催化剂在保持C-C键和生产乙烯方面显示出前景，但它们会发生失活。失活部分是由于CO2吸附形成氧碳化物相，这对乙烷脱氢是必要的，但也导致催化剂失活。向反应进料中添加少量H2可以帮助减轻这种失活，通过移除无活性的氧化物物种和恢复活性碳化物相。

基于Pt的催化剂，特别是Pt/CeO2，通过重整而不是ODH更有效地生产合成气（CO + H2）。这是由于Pt/CeO2上CO2的活化能垒比乙烷低。

CO2解离和C-H键活化的能垒因催化剂而异。在Pt/CeO2上，CO2的活化能垒为16.0 kcal/mol，乙烷为21.6 kcal/mol。在Mo2C/γ-Al2O3上，CO2的值为19.5 kcal/mol，乙烷为17.5 kcal/mol。这些活化能垒的差异导致了这些催化剂观察到的不同产物选择性。
