[1] "ODH of ethane with CO2 as a mild oxidant is proposed to occur through a Mars-van-Krevelen-type mechanism, where the catalyst first dehydrogenates ethane into ethylene and H2, then H2 reduces CO2 to CO through the reverse water-gas shift (RWGS) reaction, producing H2O as a byproduct."

[2] "To help mitigate the high deactivation over Mo2C/γ-Al2O3, a small amount of H2 (5vol%) was added to the reaction feed to remove inactive oxide species to complete the catalytic cycle and restore some of the active carbidic phase, leading to higher activity"

[3] "Cr2O3 catalysts convert high amounts of ethane, but overall CO2 conversion is low with short lifetimes, likely because of coke formation."

[4] "Pt/CeO2 shows higher activity and selectivity toward reforming products, but Mo2C/γ-Al2O3 has a lower activity with increased ethylene selectivity"

[5] "Upon reaction of ethane and CO2, Mo2C is oxidized to a greater degree. Treatment in pure CO2, however, completely oxidizes Mo2C. Therefore, the adsorbed O from CO2 is necessary to form an oxycarbide phase, which dehydrogenates ethane, but also likely contributes, at least partially, to the deactivation seen over Mo2C-based catalysts."

The mechanisms of C-H bond activation and catalyst regeneration in oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of alkanes differ between redox-active and redox-inactive metal oxide catalysts.

For redox-active catalysts like V2O5 and CeO2, the Mars-van Krevelen mechanism is typically proposed. In this mechanism, lattice oxygen from the catalyst activates the C-H bond, forming the dehydrogenated product and leaving an oxygen vacancy. This vacancy is then refilled by the oxidant.

When using traditional oxidants like O2, the oxygen vacancy is directly replenished. However, when using CO2 as the oxidant, an additional step is required. CO2 first dissociates on the catalyst surface, providing oxygen to fill the vacancy and producing CO as a byproduct. This process often involves the reverse water-gas shift reaction.

Redox-inactive catalysts, such as some supported metal catalysts, typically operate through a different mechanism. They may activate C-H bonds through direct interaction with the metal site, without involving lattice oxygen.

For catalyst regeneration, redox-active catalysts using CO2 as an oxidant face challenges due to the stability of the CO2 molecule. The effectiveness of different catalysts in activating CO2 for ODH varies:

1. CeO2-based catalysts show promise due to their high oxygen mobility and ability to activate CO2.
2. Transition metal clusters, particularly Pt-based catalysts, demonstrate high activity for CO2 activation and reforming reactions.
3. Mo2C-based catalysts show selectivity towards ethylene production but face deactivation issues due to oxidation by CO2.

The energy barriers for CO2 dissociation play a crucial role in determining catalyst effectiveness. Catalysts that can lower this barrier while maintaining selectivity towards the desired products are most effective.

It's important to note that while CO2 can serve as a mild oxidant, it often leads to lower overall conversion compared to traditional oxidants like O2. This is due to the higher stability of CO2 and the additional energy required for its activation.

Catalyst deactivation is a significant challenge in these systems, often caused by coke formation or over-oxidation of the catalyst. Strategies to mitigate deactivation include adding small amounts of H2 to the feed to remove inactive oxide species and restore the active phase of the catalyst.

In summary, the choice of catalyst and oxidant significantly impacts the mechanism and effectiveness of C-H bond activation and catalyst regeneration in ODH reactions. While CO2 offers potential environmental benefits as an oxidant, its use introduces additional complexities in catalyst design and reaction engineering.

烷烃氧化脱氢（ODH）反应中，C-H键活化和催化剂再生的机理在氧化还原活性和非氧化还原活性金属氧化物催化剂之间存在差异。

对于V2O5和CeO2等氧化还原活性催化剂，通常提出Mars-van Krevelen机理。在这种机理中，催化剂的晶格氧活化C-H键，形成脱氢产物并留下氧空位。然后，这个空位被氧化剂重新填充。

当使用O2等传统氧化剂时，氧空位直接被补充。但是，当使用CO2作为氧化剂时，需要一个额外的步骤。CO2首先在催化剂表面解离，提供氧来填充空位，并产生CO作为副产物。这个过程通常涉及逆水气变换反应。

某些负载金属催化剂等非氧化还原活性催化剂通常通过不同的机理运作。它们可能通过与金属位点的直接相互作用来活化C-H键，而不涉及晶格氧。

对于催化剂再生，使用CO2作为氧化剂的氧化还原活性催化剂面临挑战，这是由于CO2分子的稳定性。不同催化剂在活化CO2用于ODH方面的有效性各不相同：

1. 基于CeO2的催化剂由于其高氧移动性和活化CO2的能力而显示出潜力。
2. 过渡金属簇，特别是基于Pt的催化剂，表现出对CO2活化和重整反应的高活性。
3. 基于Mo2C的催化剂对乙烯生产表现出选择性，但由于CO2的氧化作用面临失活问题。

CO2解离的能量障碍在决定催化剂有效性方面起着关键作用。能够降低这一障碍同时保持对所需产物选择性的催化剂最为有效。

值得注意的是，虽然CO2可以作为温和的氧化剂，但与O2等传统氧化剂相比，它通常导致较低的总体转化率。这是由于CO2的稳定性更高，其活化需要额外的能量。

催化剂失活是这些系统中的一个重大挑战，通常由焦炭形成或催化剂过度氧化引起。缓解失活的策略包括向进料中添加少量H2以去除无活性的氧化物物种，并恢复催化剂的活性相。

总之，催化剂和氧化剂的选择显著影响ODH反应中C-H键活化和催化剂再生的机理和有效性。虽然CO2作为氧化剂提供了潜在的环境效益，但其使用在催化剂设计和反应工程方面引入了额外的复杂性。
