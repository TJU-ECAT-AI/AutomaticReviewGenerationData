[1] "ODH of ethane with CO2 as a mild oxidant is proposed to occur through a Mars-van-Krevelen-type mechanism, where the catalyst first dehydrogenates ethane into ethylene and H2, then H2 reduces CO2 to CO through the reverse water-gas shift (RWGS) reaction, producing H2O as a byproduct."

[2] "To help mitigate the high deactivation over Mo2C/γ-Al2O3, a small amount of H2 (5vol%) was added to the reaction feed to remove inactive oxide species to complete the catalytic cycle and restore some of the active carbidic phase, leading to higher activity"

[3] "For carbide catalysts, Mo2C/SiO2 has about 10% conversion with high ethylene selectivity; however, pure Mo2C and MoO3/SiO2 are not reported as active."

[4] "The lower activation barrier of CO2 over Pt/CeO2 confirms the relatively high activity of CeO2-based materials toward CO2."

The literature does not provide a comprehensive comparison of C-H bond activation mechanisms and catalyst regeneration for redox-active and redox-inactive metal oxide catalysts in oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of alkanes. However, it does offer some insights into the role of CO2 as an oxidant and the performance of different catalysts.

For CO2-based ODH, a Mars-van-Krevelen mechanism is proposed. The catalyst first dehydrogenates the alkane (in this case, ethane) to produce the alkene (ethylene) and H2. Then, H2 reduces CO2 to CO through the reverse water-gas shift reaction, producing H2O as a byproduct.

Regarding catalyst regeneration, the study mentions that for Mo2C/γ-Al2O3, adding a small amount of H2 (5 vol%) to the reaction feed helps remove inactive oxide species and restore the active carbidic phase. This leads to higher activity but also increases CO selectivity while decreasing ethylene selectivity.

The effectiveness of different catalysts for CO2 activation in ODH varies:

1. Mo2C-based catalysts: Mo2C/SiO2 shows about 10% conversion with high ethylene selectivity. However, pure Mo2C and MoO3/SiO2 are not reported as active.

2. CeO2-based catalysts: Pt/CeO2 demonstrates a lower activation barrier for CO2, indicating high activity towards CO2 activation.

3. Pt-based catalysts: These favor the reforming reaction, producing synthesis gas rather than preserving the C-C bond for ethylene production.

The literature does not provide specific information on V2O5, VOx/SiO2, or transition metal clusters for CO2-based ODH of propane. It also lacks detailed discussions on energy barriers for CO2 dissociation across different catalysts.

文献没有全面比较氧化脱氢(ODH)反应中氧化还原活性和非活性金属氧化物催化剂的C-H键活化机理和催化剂再生。但它确实提供了一些关于CO2作为氧化剂的作用以及不同催化剂性能的见解。

对于基于CO2的ODH，提出了Mars-van-Krevelen机理。催化剂首先使烷烃(在本例中为乙烷)脱氢产生烯烃(乙烯)和H2。然后，H2通过逆水气变换反应将CO2还原为CO，同时产生H2O作为副产物。

关于催化剂再生，研究提到对于Mo2C/γ-Al2O3，在反应进料中添加少量H2(5 vol%)有助于去除无活性的氧化物物种并恢复活性碳化物相。这导致活性提高，但也增加了CO选择性，同时降低了乙烯选择性。

不同催化剂在CO2活化用于ODH方面的效果各不相同：

1. 基于Mo2C的催化剂：Mo2C/SiO2显示约10%的转化率，具有高乙烯选择性。然而，纯Mo2C和MoO3/SiO2未被报道具有活性。

2. 基于CeO2的催化剂：Pt/CeO2对CO2表现出较低的活化能垒，表明对CO2活化具有高活性。

3. 基于Pt的催化剂：这些催化剂倾向于重整反应，产生合成气而不是保留C-C键以产生乙烯。

文献未提供V2O5、VOx/SiO2或过渡金属簇用于基于CO2的丙烷ODH的具体信息。它也缺乏关于不同催化剂CO2解离能垒的详细讨论。
