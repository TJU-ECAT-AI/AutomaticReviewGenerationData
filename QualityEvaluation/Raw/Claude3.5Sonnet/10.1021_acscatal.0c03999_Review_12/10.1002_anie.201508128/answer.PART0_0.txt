[1] "ODH of ethane with CO2 as a mild oxidant is proposed to occur through a Mars-van-Krevelen-type mechanism, where the catalyst first dehydrogenates ethane into ethylene and H2, then H2 reduces CO2 to CO through the reverse water-gas shift (RWGS) reaction, producing H2O as a byproduct."

[2] "To help mitigate the high deactivation over Mo2C/γ-Al2O3, a small amount of H2 (5vol%) was added to the reaction feed to remove inactive oxide species to complete the catalytic cycle and restore some of the active carbidic phase, leading to higher activity"

[3] "Pt/CeO2 and Mo2C-based catalysts have been evaluated to catalytically control the products of CO2 reduction by ethane to produce either synthesis gas or ethylene, respectively. Results of this study indicate that Pt/CeO2 is a promising catalyst to produce synthesis gas, while Mo2C/γ-Al2O3 preserves the CC bond of ethane to produce ethylene, although the catalyst deactivates."

The literature does not provide a comprehensive comparison of C-H bond activation mechanisms and catalyst regeneration for redox-active and redox-inactive metal oxide catalysts in oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of alkanes. However, it does offer some insights into the use of CO2 as an oxidant and the behavior of specific catalysts.

For CO2-mediated ODH, a Mars-van-Krevelen-type mechanism is proposed. In this mechanism, the catalyst first dehydrogenates the alkane (in this case, ethane) to produce the alkene (ethylene) and H2. Then, the H2 reduces CO2 to CO through the reverse water-gas shift reaction, producing H2O as a byproduct.

The study focuses on two types of catalysts: Pt/CeO2 and Mo2C-based catalysts. Pt/CeO2 was found to be effective in producing synthesis gas (CO + H2) through the reforming reaction, while Mo2C/γ-Al2O3 was more selective in preserving the C-C bond to produce ethylene.

Regarding catalyst regeneration, the study mentions that for Mo2C/γ-Al2O3, which suffers from high deactivation, adding a small amount of H2 (5 vol%) to the reaction feed helps remove inactive oxide species. This completes the catalytic cycle and restores some of the active carbidic phase, leading to higher activity.

The effectiveness of different catalysts in activating CO2 for ODH of propane is not directly addressed in this literature. The study focuses on ethane rather than propane, and does not discuss V2O5, VOx/SiO2, or transition metal clusters. However, it does mention that CeO2-based materials have a relatively high activity toward CO2, as evidenced by the lower activation barrier of CO2 over Pt/CeO2.

The literature does not provide specific information on the proposed mechanisms and energy barriers for CO2 dissociation over different catalysts. Further research would be needed to fully address these aspects of the question.

虽然这篇文献没有全面比较氧化还原活性和氧化还原非活性金属氧化物催化剂在烷烃氧化脱氢(ODH)中的C-H键活化机理和催化剂再生，但它确实提供了一些关于使用CO2作为氧化剂和特定催化剂行为的见解。

对于CO2介导的ODH，提出了一种Mars-van-Krevelen型机理。在这种机理中，催化剂首先使烷烃（在本例中为乙烷）脱氢产生烯烃（乙烯）和H2。然后，H2通过逆水气变换反应将CO2还原为CO，同时产生H2O作为副产品。

该研究主要关注两类催化剂：Pt/CeO2和基于Mo2C的催化剂。研究发现，Pt/CeO2在通过重整反应生产合成气（CO + H2）方面效果显著，而Mo2C/γ-Al2O3则更倾向于保持C-C键以产生乙烯。

关于催化剂再生，研究提到对于存在高失活性的Mo2C/γ-Al2O3，向反应进料中添加少量H2（5体积%）有助于去除无活性的氧化物物种。这完成了催化循环并恢复了部分活性碳化物相，从而提高了活性。

文献中没有直接讨论不同催化剂在活化CO2用于丙烷ODH方面的效果。该研究主要关注乙烷而非丙烷，也没有讨论V2O5、VOx/SiO2或过渡金属团簇。然而，它确实提到基于CeO2的材料对CO2具有相对较高的活性，这从Pt/CeO2上CO2较低的活化能障可以看出。

文献没有提供不同催化剂上CO2解离的具体机理和能量障碍信息。要全面解答这些问题的方面，需要进行更多的研究。
