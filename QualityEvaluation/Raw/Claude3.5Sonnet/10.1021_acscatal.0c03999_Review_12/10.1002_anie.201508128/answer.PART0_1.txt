[1] "ODH of ethane with CO2 as a mild oxidant is proposed to occur through a Mars-van-Krevelen-type mechanism, where the catalyst first dehydrogenates ethane into ethylene and H2, then H2 reduces CO2 to CO through the reverse water-gas shift (RWGS) reaction, producing H2O as a byproduct."

[2] "To help mitigate the high deactivation over Mo2C/γ-Al2O3, a small amount of H2 (5vol%) was added to the reaction feed to remove inactive oxide species to complete the catalytic cycle and restore some of the active carbidic phase, leading to higher activity"

[3] "Treatment in pure CO2, however, completely oxidizes Mo2C. Therefore, the adsorbed O from CO2 is necessary to form an oxycarbide phase, which dehydrogenates ethane, but also likely contributes, at least partially, to the deactivation seen over Mo2C-based catalysts."

[4] "For carbide catalysts, Mo2C/SiO2 has about 10% conversion with high ethylene selectivity; however, pure Mo2C and MoO3/SiO2 are not reported as active."

The literature provided does not contain sufficient information to fully compare and contrast the mechanisms of C-H bond activation and catalyst regeneration in oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes for redox-active and redox-inactive metal oxide catalysts. However, some relevant information can be extracted and discussed.

For CO2-based oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH), the literature suggests a Mars-van-Krevelen-type mechanism. In this process, the catalyst first dehydrogenates the alkane (in this case, ethane) to produce the corresponding alkene (ethylene) and H2. Then, the H2 reduces CO2 to CO through the reverse water-gas shift reaction, with H2O as a byproduct.

The effectiveness of different catalysts in activating CO2 for ODH of propane is not directly addressed in the given literature. However, the study focuses on ethane ODH using Mo2C-based and Pt-based catalysts. Mo2C/γ-Al2O3 showed selectivity towards ethylene production, while Pt/CeO2 favored the reforming reaction to produce synthesis gas.

Regarding catalyst regeneration, the literature mentions that for Mo2C/γ-Al2O3, adding a small amount of H2 (5 vol%) to the reaction feed helps remove inactive oxide species and restore the active carbidic phase, leading to higher activity. This suggests that hydrogen plays a role in regenerating the catalyst by reducing oxidized species.

The study also highlights that CO2 can lead to catalyst deactivation, particularly for Mo2C-based catalysts. Pure CO2 treatment completely oxidizes Mo2C, forming an oxycarbide phase. While this phase is necessary for ethane dehydrogenation, it also contributes to catalyst deactivation.

It's important to note that the literature doesn't provide specific information on V2O5, VOx/SiO2, or transition metal clusters for CO2 activation in propane ODH. The energy barriers for CO2 dissociation are also not discussed in detail for the catalysts mentioned.

提供的文献中没有足够的信息来全面比较和对比氧化还原活性和氧化还原非活性金属氧化物催化剂在烷烃氧化脱氢中C-H键活化和催化剂再生的机理。然而，可以提取和讨论一些相关信息。

对于基于CO2的氧化脱氢(ODH)，文献提出了一种Mars-van-Krevelen型机理。在这个过程中，催化剂首先使烷烃(在这种情况下是乙烷)脱氢，产生相应的烯烃(乙烯)和H2。然后，H2通过逆水气变换反应将CO2还原为CO，副产物是H2O。

文献中没有直接讨论不同催化剂在活化CO2用于丙烷ODH方面的有效性。然而，这项研究主要集中在使用Mo2C基和Pt基催化剂进行乙烷ODH。Mo2C/γ-Al2O3表现出对乙烯生产的选择性，而Pt/CeO2则倾向于重整反应，生产合成气。

关于催化剂再生，文献提到对于Mo2C/γ-Al2O3，在反应进料中添加少量H2(5体积%)有助于去除无活性的氧化物物种，恢复活性碳化物相，从而提高活性。这表明氢在通过还原氧化物物种来再生催化剂方面起着作用。

研究还强调，CO2可能导致催化剂失活，特别是对于Mo2C基催化剂。纯CO2处理会完全氧化Mo2C，形成氧碳化物相。虽然这个相对乙烷脱氢是必要的，但它也会导致催化剂失活。

需要注意的是，文献中没有提供关于V2O5、VOx/SiO2或过渡金属簇在丙烷ODH中CO2活化的具体信息。对于所提到的催化剂，CO2解离的能量壁垒也没有详细讨论。
