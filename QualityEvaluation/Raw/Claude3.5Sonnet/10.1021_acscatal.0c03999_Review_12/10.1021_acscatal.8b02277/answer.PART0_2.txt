The given literature does not contain any information relevant to answering the question about C-H bond activation mechanisms, catalyst regeneration, or oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes. The document appears to be a title and author list for a research article on dry reforming of methane using Ni/MgO catalysts, which is unrelated to the topic of the question. Without additional relevant information, it is not possible to provide an accurate answer to the question based solely on the given literature.
