          [1] "Generally, the ODHP reaction catalyzed by transition metal oxide catalysts was demonstrated to follow the redox mechanism, in which the oxidation of propane by surface lattice oxygen of transitional metal oxides is the rate-limiting step."

[2] "Different from the traditional vanadium and molybdenum-based redox metal oxide catalysts in ODHP reaction, h-BN shows very low selectivity to carbon oxides and relatively high selectivity to ethylene, compared to V-based catalysts where the main by-products are COx."

[3] "The high thermodynamic (and kinetic) unfavorability of the subsequent CH activation by the BOB oxygen is explained by poor redox ability of the surface, which differs from conventional ODHP catalysts such as vanadia and other transition-metal oxides."

[4] "Instead, we have found the redox-poor surface catalyzes the reaction by heterolytic CH cleavage followed by a reduction of the gas phase oxidant rather than the surface."

          The mechanisms of C-H bond activation and catalyst regeneration differ significantly between redox-active and redox-inactive metal oxide catalysts in the oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes.

For redox-active catalysts like traditional vanadium and molybdenum-based metal oxides, the reaction follows a redox mechanism. The rate-limiting step is the oxidation of propane by surface lattice oxygen from the transition metal oxides. This process involves the transfer of oxygen from the catalyst to the reactant, followed by the regeneration of the catalyst through re-oxidation.

In contrast, redox-inactive catalysts like hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) operate through a different mechanism. These catalysts have poor redox ability and cannot easily transfer oxygen from their lattice to the reactants. Instead, they catalyze the reaction through heterolytic C-H cleavage, followed by a reduction of the gas-phase oxidant rather than the surface.

The difference in mechanisms leads to distinct product distributions. Redox-active catalysts tend to produce more carbon oxides (COx) as by-products, while redox-inactive catalysts like h-BN show very low selectivity to carbon oxides and higher selectivity to ethylene.

Regarding the effectiveness of different catalysts in activating CO2 for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane, the role of traditional oxidants and CO2, and the proposed mechanisms and energy barriers for CO2 dissociation, the provided literature does not contain specific information about these aspects. Therefore, a comparison of V2O5, VOx/SiO2, CeO2, and transition metal clusters in terms of CO2 activation cannot be made based on the given information.

          在烷烃的氧化脱氢反应中，氧化还原活性和氧化还原惰性金属氧化物催化剂的C-H键活化和催化剂再生机制有显著差异。

对于传统的钒和钼基金属氧化物等氧化还原活性催化剂，反应遵循氧化还原机制。速率限制步骤是过渡金属氧化物表面晶格氧对丙烷的氧化。这个过程涉及氧从催化剂转移到反应物，然后通过再氧化重新生成催化剂。

相比之下，六方氮化硼（h-BN）等氧化还原惰性催化剂通过不同的机制运作。这些催化剂具有较差的氧化还原能力，不能轻易地将氧从晶格转移到反应物。相反，它们通过异裂C-H键裂解来催化反应，随后是气相氧化剂的还原，而不是表面的还原。

机制的差异导致了不同的产物分布。氧化还原活性催化剂倾向于产生更多的碳氧化物（COx）副产品，而氧化还原惰性催化剂如h-BN对碳氧化物的选择性很低，对乙烯的选择性较高。

关于不同催化剂在活化CO2用于丙烷氧化脱氢方面的效果，传统氧化剂和CO2的作用，以及CO2解离的提议机制和能量障碍，所提供的文献并不包含有关这些方面的具体信息。因此，无法基于给定信息比较V2O5、VOx/SiO2、CeO2和过渡金属簇在CO2活化方面的效果。
