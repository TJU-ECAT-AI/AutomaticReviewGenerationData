[1] "Generally, the ODHP reaction catalyzed by transition metal oxide catalysts was demonstrated to follow the redox mechanism, in which the oxidation of propane by surface lattice oxygen of transitional metal oxides is the rate-limiting step."

[2] "Different from the traditional vanadium and molybdenum-based redox metal oxide catalysts in ODHP reaction, h-BN shows very low selectivity to carbon oxides and relatively high selectivity to ethylene, compared to V-based catalysts where the main by-products are COx."

[3] "The high thermodynamic (and kinetic) unfavorability of the subsequent CH activation by the BOB oxygen is explained by poor redox ability of the surface, which differs from conventional ODHP catalysts such as vanadia and other transition-metal oxides."

[4] "Instead, we have found the redox-poor surface catalyzes the reaction by heterolytic CH cleavage followed by a reduction of the gas phase oxidant rather than the surface."

The mechanisms of C-H bond activation and catalyst regeneration differ significantly between redox-active and redox-inactive metal oxide catalysts in the oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes.

For redox-active catalysts like traditional vanadium and molybdenum-based metal oxides, the reaction follows a redox mechanism. The rate-limiting step is the oxidation of propane by surface lattice oxygen from the transitional metal oxides. This process involves the transfer of oxygen from the catalyst to the reactant, followed by the re-oxidation of the catalyst by gas-phase oxygen to regenerate the active sites.

In contrast, redox-inactive catalysts like hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) operate through a different mechanism. These catalysts have poor redox ability and cannot easily transfer lattice oxygen to the reactant. Instead, they catalyze the reaction through heterolytic C-H cleavage, followed by a reduction of the gas-phase oxidant rather than the surface. This mechanism results in lower selectivity to carbon oxides and higher selectivity to ethylene compared to redox-active catalysts.

The role of traditional oxidants like O2 is crucial in both cases, but for different reasons. In redox-active catalysts, O2 is used to regenerate the active sites by re-oxidizing the reduced metal centers. For redox-inactive catalysts, O2 acts as a gas-phase oxidant that directly participates in the reaction after the initial C-H bond activation.

The literature provided does not contain specific information about CO2 activation or the effectiveness of different catalysts (such as V2O5, VOx/SiO2, CeO2, and transition metal clusters) in activating CO2 for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane. Therefore, I cannot provide a detailed discussion on these aspects or compare the proposed mechanisms and energy barriers for CO2 dissociation.

在烷烃氧化脱氢反应中，氧化还原活性和氧化还原惰性金属氧化物催化剂的C-H键活化和催化剂再生机制存在显著差异。

对于传统的钒和钼基金属氧化物等氧化还原活性催化剂，反应遵循氧化还原机制。反应的速率限制步骤是过渡金属氧化物表面晶格氧对丙烷的氧化。这个过程涉及氧从催化剂转移到反应物，然后催化剂被气相氧再氧化以再生活性位点。

相比之下，六方氮化硼（h-BN）等氧化还原惰性催化剂通过不同的机制运作。这些催化剂的氧化还原能力较差，不能轻易将晶格氧转移给反应物。相反，它们通过异裂C-H键断裂来催化反应，随后是气相氧化剂的还原，而不是表面的还原。这种机制导致与氧化还原活性催化剂相比，碳氧化物的选择性较低，而乙烯的选择性较高。

在这两种情况下，传统氧化剂如O2的作用都至关重要，但原因不同。在氧化还原活性催化剂中，O2用于通过再氧化还原后的金属中心来再生活性位点。对于氧化还原惰性催化剂，O2作为气相氧化剂，在初始C-H键活化后直接参与反应。

所提供的文献中没有关于CO2活化或不同催化剂（如V2O5、VOx/SiO2、CeO2和过渡金属簇）在丙烷氧化脱氢中活化CO2的效能的具体信息。因此，我无法就这些方面提供详细讨论，也无法比较CO2解离的提议机制和能量障碍。
