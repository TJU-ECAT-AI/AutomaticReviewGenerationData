[1] "Generally, the ODHP reaction catalyzed by transition metal oxide catalysts was demonstrated to follow the redox mechanism, in which the oxidation of propane by surface lattice oxygen of transitional metal oxides is the rate-limiting step."

[2] "Different from the traditional vanadium and molybdenum-based redox metal oxide catalysts in ODHP reaction, h-BN shows very low selectivity to carbon oxides and relatively high selectivity to ethylene, compared to V-based catalysts where the main by-products are COx."

[3] "The high thermodynamic (and kinetic) unfavorability of the subsequent CH activation by the BOB oxygen is explained by poor redox ability of the surface, which differs from conventional ODHP catalysts such as vanadia and other transition-metal oxides."

[4] "Instead, we have found the redox-poor surface catalyzes the reaction by heterolytic CH cleavage followed by a reduction of the gas phase oxidant rather than the surface."

The mechanisms of C-H bond activation and catalyst regeneration in oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes differ significantly between redox-active and redox-inactive metal oxide catalysts.

For redox-active catalysts like transition metal oxides (e.g., V2O5, VOx/SiO2), the reaction follows a redox mechanism. The C-H bond activation occurs through oxidation of propane by surface lattice oxygen of the metal oxide. This step is typically rate-limiting. The catalyst is then regenerated by reoxidation of the reduced metal oxide surface using gas-phase oxygen.

In contrast, redox-inactive catalysts like hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) operate via a different mechanism. These catalysts have poor redox ability and cannot easily activate C-H bonds using lattice oxygen. Instead, they catalyze the reaction through heterolytic C-H cleavage, followed by reduction of gas-phase oxidants rather than the surface itself. This leads to lower selectivity towards carbon oxides and higher selectivity to ethylene compared to vanadium-based catalysts.

The literature does not provide specific information about the role of CO2 as an oxidant or the effectiveness of different catalysts in activating CO2 for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane. Similarly, there is no mention of proposed mechanisms or energy barriers for CO2 dissociation in this context. Therefore, these aspects of the question cannot be answered based on the given information.

在烷烃氧化脱氢反应中，氧化还原活性和氧化还原惰性金属氧化物催化剂的C-H键活化和催化剂再生机理有显著差异。

对于氧化还原活性催化剂，如过渡金属氧化物（例如V2O5，VOx/SiO2），反应遵循氧化还原机理。C-H键活化通过金属氧化物表面晶格氧对丙烷的氧化来实现。这一步通常是反应的限速步骤。然后，催化剂通过气相氧对还原后的金属氧化物表面的再氧化来实现再生。

相比之下，氧化还原惰性催化剂如六方氮化硼（h-BN）通过不同的机理运作。这些催化剂的氧化还原能力较差，不能轻易使用晶格氧活化C-H键。相反，它们通过异裂C-H键断裂来催化反应，随后是气相氧化剂的还原，而不是表面本身的还原。这导致与钒基催化剂相比，碳氧化物的选择性较低，而乙烯的选择性较高。

文献中没有提供关于CO2作为氧化剂的作用，或不同催化剂在活化CO2用于丙烷氧化脱氢方面的有效性的具体信息。同样，也没有提到在这种背景下CO2解离的提议机制或能量障碍。因此，基于给定的信息无法回答问题的这些方面。
