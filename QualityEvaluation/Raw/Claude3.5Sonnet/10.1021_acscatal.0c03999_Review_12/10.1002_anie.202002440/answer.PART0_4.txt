[1] "Generally, the ODHP reaction catalyzed by transition metal oxide catalysts was demonstrated to follow the redox mechanism, in which the oxidation of propane by surface lattice oxygen of transitional metal oxides is the rate-limiting step."

[2] "Different from the traditional vanadium and molybdenum-based redox metal oxide catalysts in ODHP reaction, h-BN shows very low selectivity to carbon oxides and relatively high selectivity to ethylene, compared to V-based catalysts where the main by-products are COx."

[3] "The high thermodynamic (and kinetic) unfavorability of the subsequent CH activation by the BOB oxygen is explained by poor redox ability of the surface, which differs from conventional ODHP catalysts such as vanadia and other transition-metal oxides."

The mechanisms of C-H bond activation and catalyst regeneration differ significantly between redox-active and redox-inactive metal oxide catalysts in the oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes.

For redox-active catalysts like traditional vanadium and molybdenum-based metal oxides, the reaction follows a redox mechanism. In this process, the oxidation of propane occurs through the surface lattice oxygen of the transition metal oxides, which is the rate-limiting step. The catalyst is then regenerated by re-oxidation of the reduced metal oxide surface.

In contrast, redox-inactive catalysts like hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) operate through a different mechanism. These catalysts have poor redox ability, making the activation of C-H bonds by surface oxygen thermodynamically and kinetically unfavorable. Instead, they catalyze the reaction through heterolytic C-H cleavage, followed by the reduction of a gas-phase oxidant rather than the surface itself.

This fundamental difference in mechanism leads to significant variations in product distribution. Redox-active catalysts tend to produce more carbon oxides (COx) as by-products, while redox-inactive catalysts like h-BN show very low selectivity to carbon oxides and higher selectivity to ethylene.

Regarding the role of traditional oxidants and CO2, the literature does not provide specific information about their effectiveness or the mechanisms involved for different catalysts in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane. Similarly, there is no discussion on the activation of CO2 by various catalysts such as V2O5, VOx/SiO2, CeO2, or transition metal clusters, nor any information on the proposed mechanisms or energy barriers for CO2 dissociation in this context.

在烷烃的氧化脱氢过程中，氧化还原活性和非活性金属氧化物催化剂的C-H键活化和催化剂再生机制存在显著差异。

对于传统的钒和钼基金属氧化物等氧化还原活性催化剂，反应遵循氧化还原机制。在这个过程中，丙烷的氧化是通过过渡金属氧化物的表面晶格氧进行的，这是反应的限速步骤。然后，通过还原的金属氧化物表面的再氧化来实现催化剂的再生。

相比之下，像六方氮化硼（h-BN）这样的氧化还原非活性催化剂通过不同的机制运作。这些催化剂的氧化还原能力较差，使得表面氧对C-H键的活化在热力学和动力学上都不利。相反，它们通过异裂C-H键断裂来催化反应，随后是气相氧化剂的还原，而不是表面本身的还原。

这种机制的根本差异导致了产品分布的显著变化。氧化还原活性催化剂倾向于产生更多的碳氧化物（COx）作为副产品，而像h-BN这样的氧化还原非活性催化剂对碳氧化物的选择性很低，对乙烯的选择性较高。

关于传统氧化剂和CO2的作用，文献中没有提供关于它们在丙烷氧化脱氢中对不同催化剂的有效性或涉及的机制的具体信息。同样，也没有讨论V2O5、VOx/SiO2、CeO2或过渡金属簇等各种催化剂对CO2的活化，也没有关于CO2解离的提议机制或能量障碍的信息。
