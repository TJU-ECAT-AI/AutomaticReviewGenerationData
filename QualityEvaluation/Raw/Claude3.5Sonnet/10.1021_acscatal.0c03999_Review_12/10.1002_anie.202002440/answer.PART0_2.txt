[1] "Generally, the ODHP reaction catalyzed by transition metal oxide catalysts was demonstrated to follow the redox mechanism, in which the oxidation of propane by surface lattice oxygen of transitional metal oxides is the rate-limiting step."

[2] "Different from the traditional vanadium and molybdenum-based redox metal oxide catalysts in ODHP reaction, h-BN shows very low selectivity to carbon oxides and relatively high selectivity to ethylene, compared to V-based catalysts where the main by-products are COx."

[3] "The high thermodynamic (and kinetic) unfavorability of the subsequent CH activation by the BOB oxygen is explained by poor redox ability of the surface, which differs from conventional ODHP catalysts such as vanadia and other transition-metal oxides."

[4] "Instead, we have found the redox-poor surface catalyzes the reaction by heterolytic CH cleavage followed by a reduction of the gas phase oxidant rather than the surface. The proposed mechanism bears similarities to other redox-poor oxides such as MgO, and shares their capacity for selective alkane conversions."

The mechanisms of C-H bond activation and catalyst regeneration differ significantly between redox-active and redox-inactive metal oxide catalysts in the oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of alkanes.

For redox-active catalysts like traditional vanadium and molybdenum-based metal oxides, the reaction follows a redox mechanism. In this case, the rate-limiting step is the oxidation of propane by surface lattice oxygen from the transitional metal oxides. These catalysts typically show high selectivity to carbon oxides (COx) as by-products.

In contrast, redox-inactive catalysts like hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) operate through a different mechanism. These catalysts have poor redox ability, making C-H activation by surface oxygen thermodynamically and kinetically unfavorable. Instead, they catalyze the reaction through heterolytic C-H cleavage, followed by reduction of a gas-phase oxidant rather than the surface itself. This mechanism is similar to other redox-poor oxides like MgO.

The difference in mechanisms leads to distinct product distributions. Redox-inactive catalysts like h-BN show very low selectivity to carbon oxides and higher selectivity to ethylene compared to vanadium-based catalysts.

Regarding the role of traditional oxidants and CO2, and the effectiveness of different catalysts in activating CO2 for ODH of propane, the provided literature does not contain specific information on these aspects. Further research would be needed to address these points, particularly concerning CO2 activation and the performance of catalysts like V2O5, VOx/SiO2, CeO2, and transition metal clusters in this context.

在烷烃氧化脱氢（ODH）反应中，氧化还原活性和氧化还原惰性金属氧化物催化剂的C-H键活化和催化剂再生机理存在显著差异。

对于传统的钒和钼基金属氧化物等氧化还原活性催化剂，反应遵循氧化还原机理。在这种情况下，限速步骤是过渡金属氧化物表面晶格氧对丙烷的氧化。这些催化剂通常对一氧化碳（COx）副产品具有高选择性。

相比之下，像六方氮化硼（h-BN）这样的氧化还原惰性催化剂通过不同的机理运作。这些催化剂的氧化还原能力较差，使得表面氧对C-H活化在热力学和动力学上都不利。相反，它们通过异裂C-H断裂来催化反应，随后是气相氧化剂的还原，而不是表面本身的还原。这种机理类似于其他氧化还原能力较差的氧化物，如MgO。

机理的差异导致了不同的产品分布。像h-BN这样的氧化还原惰性催化剂对碳氧化物的选择性很低，而对乙烯的选择性比钒基催化剂高。

关于传统氧化剂和CO2的作用，以及不同催化剂在活化CO2用于丙烷ODH方面的有效性，所提供的文献中没有具体信息。需要进一步研究来解决这些问题，特别是关于CO2的活化以及V2O5、VOx/SiO2、CeO2和过渡金属簇等催化剂在这方面的性能。
