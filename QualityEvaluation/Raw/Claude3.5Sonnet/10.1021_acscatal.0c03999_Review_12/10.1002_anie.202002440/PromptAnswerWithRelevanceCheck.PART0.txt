The mechanisms of C-H bond activation and catalyst regeneration differ significantly between redox-active and redox-inactive metal oxide catalysts in the oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes.

For redox-active catalysts like traditional vanadium and molybdenum-based metal oxides, the reaction follows a redox mechanism. The rate-limiting step is the oxidation of propane by surface lattice oxygen from the transitional metal oxides. This process involves the transfer of oxygen from the catalyst to the reactant, followed by the re-oxidation of the catalyst by gas-phase oxygen to regenerate the active sites.

In contrast, redox-inactive catalysts like hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) operate through a different mechanism. These catalysts have poor redox ability and cannot easily transfer lattice oxygen to the reactant. Instead, they catalyze the reaction through heterolytic C-H cleavage, followed by a reduction of the gas-phase oxidant rather than the surface. This mechanism results in lower selectivity to carbon oxides and higher selectivity to ethylene compared to redox-active catalysts.

The role of traditional oxidants like O2 is crucial in both cases, but for different reasons. In redox-active catalysts, O2 is used to regenerate the active sites by re-oxidizing the reduced metal centers. For redox-inactive catalysts, O2 acts as a gas-phase oxidant that directly participates in the reaction after the initial C-H bond activation.

The literature provided does not contain specific information about CO2 activation or the effectiveness of different catalysts (such as V2O5, VOx/SiO2, CeO2, and transition metal clusters) in activating CO2 for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane. Therefore, I cannot provide a detailed discussion on these aspects or compare the proposed mechanisms and energy barriers for CO2 dissociation.

在烷烃氧化脱氢反应中，氧化还原活性和氧化还原惰性金属氧化物催化剂的C-H键活化和催化剂再生机制存在显著差异。

对于传统的钒和钼基金属氧化物等氧化还原活性催化剂，反应遵循氧化还原机制。反应的速率限制步骤是过渡金属氧化物表面晶格氧对丙烷的氧化。这个过程涉及氧从催化剂转移到反应物，然后催化剂被气相氧再氧化以再生活性位点。

相比之下，六方氮化硼（h-BN）等氧化还原惰性催化剂通过不同的机制运作。这些催化剂的氧化还原能力较差，不能轻易将晶格氧转移给反应物。相反，它们通过异裂C-H键断裂来催化反应，随后是气相氧化剂的还原，而不是表面的还原。这种机制导致与氧化还原活性催化剂相比，碳氧化物的选择性较低，而乙烯的选择性较高。

在这两种情况下，传统氧化剂如O2的作用都至关重要，但原因不同。在氧化还原活性催化剂中，O2用于通过再氧化还原后的金属中心来再生活性位点。对于氧化还原惰性催化剂，O2作为气相氧化剂，在初始C-H键活化后直接参与反应。

所提供的文献中没有关于CO2活化或不同催化剂（如V2O5、VOx/SiO2、CeO2和过渡金属簇）在丙烷氧化脱氢中活化CO2的效能的具体信息。因此，我无法就这些方面提供详细讨论，也无法比较CO2解离的提议机制和能量障碍。

The mechanisms of C-H bond activation and catalyst regeneration in oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes differ significantly between redox-active and redox-inactive metal oxide catalysts.

For redox-active catalysts like transition metal oxides (e.g., V2O5, VOx/SiO2), the reaction follows a redox mechanism. The C-H bond activation occurs through oxidation of propane by surface lattice oxygen of the metal oxide. This step is typically rate-limiting. The catalyst is then regenerated by reoxidation of the reduced metal oxide surface using gas-phase oxygen.

In contrast, redox-inactive catalysts like hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) operate via a different mechanism. These catalysts have poor redox ability and cannot easily activate C-H bonds using lattice oxygen. Instead, they catalyze the reaction through heterolytic C-H cleavage, followed by reduction of gas-phase oxidants rather than the surface itself. This leads to lower selectivity towards carbon oxides and higher selectivity to ethylene compared to vanadium-based catalysts.

The literature does not provide specific information about the role of CO2 as an oxidant or the effectiveness of different catalysts in activating CO2 for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane. Similarly, there is no mention of proposed mechanisms or energy barriers for CO2 dissociation in this context. Therefore, these aspects of the question cannot be answered based on the given information.

在烷烃氧化脱氢反应中，氧化还原活性和氧化还原惰性金属氧化物催化剂的C-H键活化和催化剂再生机理有显著差异。

对于氧化还原活性催化剂，如过渡金属氧化物（例如V2O5，VOx/SiO2），反应遵循氧化还原机理。C-H键活化通过金属氧化物表面晶格氧对丙烷的氧化来实现。这一步通常是反应的限速步骤。然后，催化剂通过气相氧对还原后的金属氧化物表面的再氧化来实现再生。

相比之下，氧化还原惰性催化剂如六方氮化硼（h-BN）通过不同的机理运作。这些催化剂的氧化还原能力较差，不能轻易使用晶格氧活化C-H键。相反，它们通过异裂C-H键断裂来催化反应，随后是气相氧化剂的还原，而不是表面本身的还原。这导致与钒基催化剂相比，碳氧化物的选择性较低，而乙烯的选择性较高。

文献中没有提供关于CO2作为氧化剂的作用，或不同催化剂在活化CO2用于丙烷氧化脱氢方面的有效性的具体信息。同样，也没有提到在这种背景下CO2解离的提议机制或能量障碍。因此，基于给定的信息无法回答问题的这些方面。

The mechanisms of C-H bond activation and catalyst regeneration differ significantly between redox-active and redox-inactive metal oxide catalysts in the oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of alkanes.

For redox-active catalysts like traditional vanadium and molybdenum-based metal oxides, the reaction follows a redox mechanism. In this case, the rate-limiting step is the oxidation of propane by surface lattice oxygen from the transitional metal oxides. These catalysts typically show high selectivity to carbon oxides (COx) as by-products.

In contrast, redox-inactive catalysts like hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) operate through a different mechanism. These catalysts have poor redox ability, making C-H activation by surface oxygen thermodynamically and kinetically unfavorable. Instead, they catalyze the reaction through heterolytic C-H cleavage, followed by reduction of a gas-phase oxidant rather than the surface itself. This mechanism is similar to other redox-poor oxides like MgO.

The difference in mechanisms leads to distinct product distributions. Redox-inactive catalysts like h-BN show very low selectivity to carbon oxides and higher selectivity to ethylene compared to vanadium-based catalysts.

Regarding the role of traditional oxidants and CO2, and the effectiveness of different catalysts in activating CO2 for ODH of propane, the provided literature does not contain specific information on these aspects. Further research would be needed to address these points, particularly concerning CO2 activation and the performance of catalysts like V2O5, VOx/SiO2, CeO2, and transition metal clusters in this context.

对于传统的钒和钼基金属氧化物等氧化还原活性催化剂，反应遵循氧化还原机理。在这种情况下，限速步骤是过渡金属氧化物表面晶格氧对丙烷的氧化。这些催化剂通常对一氧化碳（COx）副产品具有高选择性。

相比之下，像六方氮化硼（h-BN）这样的氧化还原惰性催化剂通过不同的机理运作。这些催化剂的氧化还原能力较差，使得表面氧对C-H活化在热力学和动力学上都不利。相反，它们通过异裂C-H断裂来催化反应，随后是气相氧化剂的还原，而不是表面本身的还原。这种机理类似于其他氧化还原能力较差的氧化物，如MgO。

机理的差异导致了不同的产品分布。像h-BN这样的氧化还原惰性催化剂对碳氧化物的选择性很低，而对乙烯的选择性比钒基催化剂高。

关于传统氧化剂和CO2的作用，以及不同催化剂在活化CO2用于丙烷ODH方面的有效性，所提供的文献中没有具体信息。需要进一步研究来解决这些问题，特别是关于CO2的活化以及V2O5、VOx/SiO2、CeO2和过渡金属簇等催化剂在这方面的性能。
