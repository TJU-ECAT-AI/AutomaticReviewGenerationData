[1] "The activation of CO2 is one of the key steps for dry reforming of CH3CH3 by CO2, which produces CO and provides *O species as oxidizing agent for CH3CH3 oxidation."

[2] "By comparison, in the presence of *H dissociated from *CH3CH3, *CO2 prefers to undergo the reverse-water-gas-shift (RWGS) reaction to form *HOCO (E = 0.23 eV, Ea = 1.02 eV) or *HCOO (E = 0.40 eV, Ea = 1.33 eV) intermediate with lower barriers according to the DFT calculated barriers."

[3] "The direct *CO2 dissociation to *CO + *O is a potentially difficult step (E = 1.52 eV and Ea = 2.13 eV, Table S3)."

[4] "The KMC simulation results reveal that the rate for *CO2 dissociation to *CO is much higher than the rate for *HOCO formation and dissociation (Figure S3), though the preference should be opposite according to the barriers from DFT calculations in section 3.1."

[5] "The presence of *O as a surface intermediate suggests that direct *CO2 dissociation to *CO + *O is plausible, rather than hydrogenation to *HOCO."

The mechanisms of C-H bond activation and catalyst regeneration differ between redox-active and redox-inactive metal oxide catalysts in the oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes:

For redox-active catalysts like V2O5 and VOx/SiO2, the lattice oxygen participates directly in abstracting hydrogen from the alkane, forming hydroxyl groups on the catalyst surface. The catalyst is then regenerated by reoxidation using a traditional oxidant like O2.

For redox-inactive catalysts like CeO2, the C-H activation occurs via a different mechanism, likely involving surface oxygen species or coordinatively unsaturated metal sites. The catalyst regeneration does not involve bulk lattice oxygen exchange.

When using CO2 as an oxidant instead of O2, the mechanisms differ:

CO2 activation is more challenging than O2 activation. On transition metal clusters, CO2 can dissociate directly to CO and O, providing surface oxygen for the dehydrogenation reaction. The activation barriers for CO2 dissociation are generally higher than for O2.

On oxide catalysts, CO2 likely activates via formation of carbonate or carboxylate surface species rather than direct dissociation. These species can then participate in the dehydrogenation reaction.

For propane dehydrogenation specifically:

V2O5 and VOx/SiO2 catalysts are effective with O2 but less so with CO2 due to the more difficult CO2 activation. 

CeO2 shows some activity for propane dehydrogenation with CO2, likely due to its oxygen storage capacity and ability to form surface carbonates.

Transition metal clusters (e.g. Pt, PtNi) are more effective at activating CO2 via direct dissociation, making them promising for propane dehydrogenation with CO2.

The effectiveness of different catalysts for CO2-assisted propane dehydrogenation depends on their ability to activate CO2 and provide reactive oxygen species, as well as their propensity for side reactions like dry reforming. Catalysts that can dissociate CO2 at lower energy barriers while maintaining selectivity for dehydrogenation are most promising for this reaction.

烷烃氧化脱氢反应中,红氧化物和非红氧化物金属氧化物催化剂的C-H键活化和催化剂再生机理存在差异:

对于V2O5和VOx/SiO2等红氧化物催化剂,晶格氧直接参与从烷烃中提取氢,在催化剂表面形成羟基。然后,催化剂通过使用O2等传统氧化剂再氧化来再生。

对于CeO2等非红氧化物催化剂,C-H活化通过不同的机制进行,可能涉及表面氧物种或配位不饱和金属位点。催化剂再生不涉及体相晶格氧交换。

使用CO2代替O2作为氧化剂时,机理有所不同:

CO2的活化比O2的活化更具挑战性。在过渡金属簇上,CO2可以直接解离成CO和O,为脱氢反应提供表面氧。CO2解离的活化能垒通常高于O2。

在氧化物催化剂上,CO2可能通过形成碳酸盐或羧酸盐表面物种而不是直接解离来活化。这些物种随后可以参与脱氢反应。

具体到丙烷脱氢:

V2O5和VOx/SiO2催化剂在O2存在下有效,但在CO2存在下效果较差,这是由于CO2活化更困难。

CeO2显示出一些CO2辅助丙烷脱氢的活性,这可能是由于其氧存储能力和形成表面碳酸盐的能力。

过渡金属簇(如Pt、PtNi)更有效地通过直接解离来活化CO2,使其成为CO2辅助丙烷脱氢的有前景的催化剂。

不同催化剂对CO2辅助丙烷脱氢的有效性取决于它们活化CO2和提供活性氧物种的能力,以及它们对干重整等副反应的倾向性。能够在较低能量障碍下解离CO2,同时保持脱氢选择性的催化剂对这种反应最有前景。
