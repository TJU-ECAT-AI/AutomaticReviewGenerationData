Read the questions and answers provided below. First, critically assess the overall relevance of the answers provided to the set of questions asked.

If, upon your assessment, you find that the answers do not contain information that is relevant to the questions asked, stop your review process immediately and respond with a single sentence: "※※※※※※※The provided answers are not relevant to the questions.※※※※※※※". Do not provide any additional explanation or background information, only this sentence should be given as a response in case of irrelevant answers.

If, however, the answers are relevant to the questions asked, proceed to compile answers for each question according to the instructions below. Ensure to aggregate all the relevant answers from the multiple answer results provided in the document, and organize them sequentially by their order number, compiling the corresponding quotes, English answers, and Chinese answers for each question.

If the provided answers' quotes are not differentiated by question, ensure to break them down and assign the quotes to each respective question, outputting them separately within each question's section.

To provide a comprehensive review, differentiate the responses into quotes, English answers, and Chinese answers for each question based on the details given in the 'Answer' XML tags. Structure your review using the XML format showcased below if the answers are relevant to the questions asked:

Compare and contrast the mechanisms of C-H bond activation and catalyst regeneration in oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes for redox-active and redox-inactive metal oxide catalysts, explaining the role of traditional oxidants and CO2. Include a discussion on the effectiveness of different catalysts (such as V2O5, VOx/SiO2, CeO2, and transition metal clusters) in activating CO2 for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane, considering the proposed mechanisms and energy barriers for CO2 dissociation.

The given literature does not contain any relevant information to answer the question about comparing and contrasting the mechanisms of C-H bond activation and catalyst regeneration in oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes for redox-active and redox-inactive metal oxide catalysts. The text provided is only a title and author list for a research article, without any content about the mechanisms, catalysts, or processes mentioned in the question. There is no information about traditional oxidants, CO2 activation, or the effectiveness of different catalysts like V2O5, VOx/SiO2, CeO2, and transition metal clusters in activating CO2 for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane. The document does not discuss any proposed mechanisms or energy barriers for CO2 dissociation. Therefore, this question cannot be answered based on the given literature.

给出的文献不包含任何相关信息来回答关于比较和对比氧化脱氢烷烃的C-H键活化和催化剂再生机制的问题，无论是对于氧化还原活性还是氧化还原惰性的金属氧化物催化剂。所提供的文本只是一篇研究文章的标题和作者列表，没有任何关于问题中提到的机制、催化剂或过程的内容。文中没有关于传统氧化剂、CO2活化的信息，也没有关于不同催化剂（如V2O5、VOx/SiO2、CeO2和过渡金属簇）在活化CO2用于丙烷氧化脱氢方面的有效性的信息。文档没有讨论任何CO2解离的提议机制或能量障碍。因此，基于给定的文献无法回答这个问题。
