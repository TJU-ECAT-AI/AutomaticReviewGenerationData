<EnglishVersionAnswer>

The mechanisms of C-H bond activation and catalyst regeneration differ between redox-active and redox-inactive metal oxide catalysts in oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of alkanes. 

For redox-active catalysts like V2O5 or VOx/SiO2, the Mars-van Krevelen mechanism typically operates. The lattice oxygen participates in C-H bond activation, forming hydroxyl groups and reducing the metal center. The catalyst is then regenerated by gas-phase oxygen, which re-oxidizes the metal and removes the hydroxyl groups.

In contrast, redox-inactive catalysts like CeO2 cannot easily change oxidation states. Instead, they may activate C-H bonds through surface oxygen vacancies or Lewis acid sites. Regeneration occurs through adsorption and activation of oxidants on the surface.

Traditional oxidants like O2 are strong and can lead to overoxidation. CO2 as a soft oxidant offers several advantages: it reduces deep oxidation and coking, while promoting propane conversion through the reverse water-gas shift reaction.

Different catalysts show varying effectiveness in activating CO2 for propane ODH:

- CeO2 is promising due to its ability to directly cleave the C=O bond in CO2.
- Fe-Ni clusters on CeO2 favor C-H bond activation.
- Pt-containing bimetallic clusters tend to promote C-C cleavage instead.

The effectiveness depends on the catalyst's ability to lower the energy barrier for CO2 dissociation and subsequent oxygen insertion into the alkane. CeO2-based catalysts, especially when doped with transition metals like Fe, show good potential for CO2 activation and selective ODH of propane.

在烷烃氧化脱氢(ODH)反应中，氧化还原活性和非氧化还原活性金属氧化物催化剂的C-H键活化和催化剂再生机理存在差异。

对于V2O5或VOx/SiO2等氧化还原活性催化剂，通常遵循Mars-van Krevelen机理。晶格氧参与C-H键活化，形成羟基并还原金属中心。然后气相氧重新氧化金属并去除羟基，从而再生催化剂。

相比之下，CeO2等氧化还原非活性催化剂难以改变氧化态。它们可能通过表面氧空位或Lewis酸位活化C-H键。再生是通过氧化剂在表面吸附和活化实现的。

传统氧化剂如O2强度较大，可能导致过度氧化。CO2作为软氧化剂具有几个优势：它减少深度氧化和积碳，同时通过逆水煤气反应促进丙烷转化。

不同催化剂在活化CO2用于丙烷ODH方面表现不同：

- CeO2由于能够直接裂解CO2中的C=O键而具有前景。
- CeO2上的Fe-Ni簇有利于C-H键活化。
- 含Pt的双金属簇倾向于促进C-C键裂解。

效果取决于催化剂降低CO2解离能垒和随后氧插入烷烃的能力。基于CeO2的催化剂，尤其是掺杂Fe等过渡金属时，在CO2活化和选择性丙烷ODH方面表现出良好的潜力。

The mechanisms of C-H bond activation and catalyst regeneration differ between redox-active and redox-inactive metal oxide catalysts in oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of alkanes. 

For redox-active catalysts like V2O5 and VOx/SiO2, the Mars-van Krevelen mechanism typically operates. This involves the lattice oxygen of the metal oxide participating in C-H bond activation, followed by catalyst re-oxidation by gas-phase oxygen. The catalyst undergoes redox cycles during the reaction.

In contrast, redox-inactive catalysts like CeO2 cannot easily change oxidation states. They likely operate via a different mechanism where surface oxygen species or defect sites activate C-H bonds. Regeneration occurs through gas-phase oxygen replenishing surface oxygen.

When using CO2 instead of O2 as the oxidant, the mechanisms change. CO2 acts as a softer oxidant that can avoid deep oxidation of products. It participates in the reverse water-gas shift reaction, which favors alkane conversion. 

Different catalysts show varying effectiveness in activating CO2 for propane ODH:

- CeO2 is considered highly promising due to its ability to directly cleave the C=O bond in CO2.
- Fe-Ni bimetallic catalysts on CeO2 favor C-H bond activation.
- Pt-containing bimetallic catalysts tend to promote C-C cleavage instead.

The bimetallic composition can be tuned to balance competitive pathways like ODH, reverse water-gas shift, and dry reforming to optimize olefin selectivity. Overall, CO2 activation appears to occur more readily on CeO2-based catalysts compared to traditional metal oxides, making them attractive for CO2-assisted ODH reactions.

- 含Pt的双金属催化剂倾向于促进C-C键裂解。

可以调节双金属组成以平衡ODH、逆水煤气反应和干重整等竞争性反应途径,以优化烯烃选择性。总的来说,与传统金属氧化物相比,CO2在基于CeO2的催化剂上的活化似乎更容易发生,这使得它们在CO2辅助ODH反应中具有吸引力。

The literature does not provide a comprehensive comparison of C-H bond activation mechanisms between redox-active and redox-inactive metal oxide catalysts for oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of alkanes. However, it does offer some insights into CO2-assisted ODH over certain catalysts.

For CO2-assisted ODH of propane, the literature highlights the effectiveness of Fe-doped CeO2 catalysts. CeO2 is described as a promising support due to its ability to activate CO2 through direct C=O bond scission. This suggests that CeO2 plays a crucial role in CO2 activation for the ODH process.

The study mentions that olefin selectivity depends on competitive reaction pathways, including ODH, reverse water gas shift, and alkane dry reforming. These pathways can be tuned by selecting the appropriate bimetallic composition of active sites. This implies that the choice of metals in the catalyst significantly influences the reaction mechanism and product distribution.

Regarding C-H bond activation, DFT calculations cited in the literature suggest that Fe-Ni surfaces favor C-H bond scission, while Pt-determined surfaces favor C-C cleavage. This indicates that different metal combinations can lead to different bond activation preferences, which in turn affects the overall reaction pathway and product selectivity.

The literature emphasizes the importance of oxygen mobility and oxygen storage capacity (OSC) of cerium oxide materials in creating stable catalytic systems. This suggests that the redox properties of CeO2 play a crucial role in the catalyst's performance and stability.

While the document doesn't explicitly compare traditional oxidants with CO2, it does focus on CO2 as an oxidant for propane ODH. The use of CO2 as a soft oxidant is presented as a strategy to avoid deep oxidation of alkanes/alkenes and reduce coke formation, which are common issues with traditional oxidants like O2.

Overall, the literature suggests that CO2-assisted ODH over Fe-doped CeO2 catalysts involves a complex interplay of CO2 activation, C-H bond scission, and redox properties of the catalyst. The specific mechanisms and energy barriers for CO2 dissociation are not detailed in the provided excerpt, but the importance of CeO2 in CO2 activation is emphasized.

虽然文献没有全面比较氧化还原活性和氧化还原非活性金属氧化物催化剂在烷烃氧化脱氢(ODH)中C-H键活化机理的差异，但它确实提供了一些关于某些催化剂在CO2辅助ODH中的见解。

对于CO2辅助的丙烷ODH，文献强调了Fe掺杂CeO2催化剂的有效性。CeO2被描述为一种有前景的载体，因为它能够通过直接C=O键断裂来活化CO2。这表明CeO2在ODH过程中的CO2活化中起着关键作用。

研究提到，烯烃选择性取决于竞争性反应途径，包括ODH、逆水煤气变换和烷烃干重整。这些途径可以通过选择适当的活性位点双金属组成来调节。这意味着催化剂中金属的选择显著影响反应机理和产物分布。

关于C-H键活化，文献中引用的DFT计算表明，Fe-Ni表面有利于C-H键断裂，而Pt主导的表面有利于C-C键断裂。这表明不同的金属组合可以导致不同的键活化偏好，从而影响整体反应途径和产物选择性。

文献强调了氧化铈材料的氧移动性和氧储存能力(OSC)在创建稳定催化系统中的重要性。这表明CeO2的氧化还原性质在催化剂的性能和稳定性中起着关键作用。

虽然文档没有明确比较传统氧化剂和CO2，但它确实关注了CO2作为丙烷ODH的氧化剂。使用CO2作为软氧化剂被认为是一种避免烷烃/烯烃深度氧化和减少积炭形成的策略，这些是使用传统氧化剂如O2时常见的问题。

总的来说，文献表明，Fe掺杂CeO2催化剂上的CO2辅助ODH涉及CO2活化、C-H键断裂和催化剂氧化还原性质的复杂相互作用。虽然所提供的摘录中没有详细说明CO2解离的具体机理和能量障碍，但强调了CeO2在CO2活化中的重要性。

For redox-active catalysts like V2O5 or VOx/SiO2, the Mars-van Krevelen mechanism typically operates. The lattice oxygen participates in C-H bond activation, forming hydroxyl groups and reducing the metal center. The catalyst is then regenerated by reoxidation with gas-phase oxygen.

In contrast, redox-inactive catalysts like CeO2 cannot easily change oxidation state. They likely activate C-H bonds through surface oxygen species or defect sites. Regeneration occurs through oxygen exchange with the gas phase rather than redox cycling of the metal.

When using CO2 instead of O2 as the oxidant, the mechanisms change. CO2 is a milder oxidant that can help avoid overoxidation. It can regenerate the catalyst through the reverse water-gas shift reaction, consuming H2 produced during dehydrogenation.

For CO2 activation, CeO2 appears particularly effective due to its ability to directly cleave the C=O bond. This likely occurs at oxygen vacancy sites. Transition metal clusters like Fe-Ni also show promise, with Fe-Ni surfaces favoring C-H activation while Pt-containing surfaces favor C-C cleavage.

The effectiveness of different catalysts in activating CO2 for propane ODH depends on their surface properties and ability to cleave the C=O bond. CeO2 and Fe-doped CeO2 show good performance due to oxygen mobility and vacancy formation. Bimetallic systems like Fe-Ni offer tunability in selectivity between ODH and competing reactions.

Overall, using CO2 as a soft oxidant in ODH reactions over carefully designed catalysts like Fe-doped CeO2 allows for improved stability and selectivity compared to traditional ODH with O2. The key is balancing C-H activation, CO2 dissociation, and suppression of overoxidation pathways through rational catalyst design.

对于V2O5或VOx/SiO2等氧化还原活性催化剂，通常遵循Mars-van Krevelen机理。晶格氧参与C-H键的活化，形成羟基并还原金属中心。然后催化剂通过气相氧的再氧化而再生。

相比之下，像CeO2这样的非氧化还原活性催化剂不易改变氧化态。它们可能通过表面氧物种或缺陷位点来活化C-H键。再生是通过与气相的氧交换而不是金属的氧化还原循环来实现的。

当使用CO2代替O2作为氧化剂时，机理会发生变化。CO2是一种较温和的氧化剂，可以帮助避免过度氧化。它可以通过逆水气变换反应来再生催化剂，消耗脱氢过程中产生的H2。

对于CO2的活化，CeO2由于其直接裂解C=O键的能力而显得特别有效。这可能发生在氧空位处。Fe-Ni等过渡金属簇也显示出前景，Fe-Ni表面有利于C-H活化，而含Pt表面有利于C-C裂解。

不同催化剂在活化CO2用于丙烷ODH的有效性取决于它们的表面性质和裂解C=O键的能力。由于氧的移动性和空位的形成，CeO2和Fe掺杂CeO2表现出良好的性能。Fe-Ni等双金属系统在ODH和竞争反应之间的选择性方面提供了可调性。

总的来说，在精心设计的催化剂（如Fe掺杂CeO2）上使用CO2作为温和氧化剂进行ODH反应，与传统的O2 ODH相比，可以获得更好的稳定性和选择性。关键是通过合理的催化剂设计来平衡C-H活化、CO2解离和抑制过度氧化途径。
