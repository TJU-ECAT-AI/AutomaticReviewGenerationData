The literature does not provide a comprehensive comparison of C-H bond activation mechanisms between redox-active and redox-inactive metal oxide catalysts for oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of alkanes. However, it does offer some insights into CO2-assisted ODH over certain catalysts.

For CO2-assisted ODH of propane, the literature highlights the effectiveness of Fe-doped CeO2 catalysts. CeO2 is described as a promising support due to its ability to activate CO2 through direct C=O bond scission. This suggests that CeO2 plays a crucial role in CO2 activation for the ODH process.

The study mentions that olefin selectivity depends on competitive reaction pathways, including ODH, reverse water gas shift, and alkane dry reforming. These pathways can be tuned by selecting the appropriate bimetallic composition of active sites. This implies that the choice of metals in the catalyst significantly influences the reaction mechanism and product distribution.

Regarding C-H bond activation, DFT calculations cited in the literature suggest that Fe-Ni surfaces favor C-H bond scission, while Pt-determined surfaces favor C-C cleavage. This indicates that different metal combinations can lead to different bond activation preferences, which in turn affects the overall reaction pathway and product selectivity.

The literature emphasizes the importance of oxygen mobility and oxygen storage capacity (OSC) of cerium oxide materials in creating stable catalytic systems. This suggests that the redox properties of CeO2 play a crucial role in the catalyst's performance and stability.

While the document doesn't explicitly compare traditional oxidants with CO2, it does focus on CO2 as an oxidant for propane ODH. The use of CO2 as a soft oxidant is presented as a strategy to avoid deep oxidation of alkanes/alkenes and reduce coke formation, which are common issues with traditional oxidants like O2.

Overall, the literature suggests that CO2-assisted ODH over Fe-doped CeO2 catalysts involves a complex interplay of CO2 activation, C-H bond scission, and redox properties of the catalyst. The specific mechanisms and energy barriers for CO2 dissociation are not detailed in the provided excerpt, but the importance of CeO2 in CO2 activation is emphasized.

虽然文献没有全面比较氧化还原活性和氧化还原非活性金属氧化物催化剂在烷烃氧化脱氢(ODH)中C-H键活化机理的差异，但它确实提供了一些关于某些催化剂在CO2辅助ODH中的见解。

对于CO2辅助的丙烷ODH，文献强调了Fe掺杂CeO2催化剂的有效性。CeO2被描述为一种有前景的载体，因为它能够通过直接C=O键断裂来活化CO2。这表明CeO2在ODH过程中的CO2活化中起着关键作用。

研究提到，烯烃选择性取决于竞争性反应途径，包括ODH、逆水煤气变换和烷烃干重整。这些途径可以通过选择适当的活性位点双金属组成来调节。这意味着催化剂中金属的选择显著影响反应机理和产物分布。

关于C-H键活化，文献中引用的DFT计算表明，Fe-Ni表面有利于C-H键断裂，而Pt主导的表面有利于C-C键断裂。这表明不同的金属组合可以导致不同的键活化偏好，从而影响整体反应途径和产物选择性。

文献强调了氧化铈材料的氧移动性和氧储存能力(OSC)在创建稳定催化系统中的重要性。这表明CeO2的氧化还原性质在催化剂的性能和稳定性中起着关键作用。

虽然文档没有明确比较传统氧化剂和CO2，但它确实关注了CO2作为丙烷ODH的氧化剂。使用CO2作为软氧化剂被认为是一种避免烷烃/烯烃深度氧化和减少积炭形成的策略，这些是使用传统氧化剂如O2时常见的问题。

总的来说，文献表明，Fe掺杂CeO2催化剂上的CO2辅助ODH涉及CO2活化、C-H键断裂和催化剂氧化还原性质的复杂相互作用。虽然所提供的摘录中没有详细说明CO2解离的具体机理和能量障碍，但强调了CeO2在CO2活化中的重要性。
