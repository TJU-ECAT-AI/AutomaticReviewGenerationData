The mechanisms of C-H bond activation and catalyst regeneration differ between redox-active and redox-inactive metal oxide catalysts in oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of alkanes. 

For redox-active catalysts like V2O5 or VOx/SiO2, the Mars-van Krevelen mechanism typically operates. The lattice oxygen participates in C-H bond activation, forming hydroxyl groups and reducing the metal center. The catalyst is then regenerated by reoxidation with gas-phase oxygen.

In contrast, redox-inactive catalysts like CeO2 cannot easily change oxidation state. They likely activate C-H bonds through surface oxygen species or defect sites. Regeneration occurs through oxygen exchange with the gas phase rather than redox cycling of the metal.

When using CO2 instead of O2 as the oxidant, the mechanisms change. CO2 is a milder oxidant that can help avoid overoxidation. It can regenerate the catalyst through the reverse water-gas shift reaction, consuming H2 produced during dehydrogenation.

For CO2 activation, CeO2 appears particularly effective due to its ability to directly cleave the C=O bond. This likely occurs at oxygen vacancy sites. Transition metal clusters like Fe-Ni also show promise, with Fe-Ni surfaces favoring C-H activation while Pt-containing surfaces favor C-C cleavage.

The effectiveness of different catalysts in activating CO2 for propane ODH depends on their surface properties and ability to cleave the C=O bond. CeO2 and Fe-doped CeO2 show good performance due to oxygen mobility and vacancy formation. Bimetallic systems like Fe-Ni offer tunability in selectivity between ODH and competing reactions.

Overall, using CO2 as a soft oxidant in ODH reactions over carefully designed catalysts like Fe-doped CeO2 allows for improved stability and selectivity compared to traditional ODH with O2. The key is balancing C-H activation, CO2 dissociation, and suppression of overoxidation pathways through rational catalyst design.

在烷烃的氧化脱氢(ODH)反应中，氧化还原活性和非氧化还原活性金属氧化物催化剂的C-H键活化和催化剂再生机理是不同的。

对于V2O5或VOx/SiO2等氧化还原活性催化剂，通常遵循Mars-van Krevelen机理。晶格氧参与C-H键的活化，形成羟基并还原金属中心。然后催化剂通过气相氧的再氧化而再生。

相比之下，像CeO2这样的非氧化还原活性催化剂不易改变氧化态。它们可能通过表面氧物种或缺陷位点来活化C-H键。再生是通过与气相的氧交换而不是金属的氧化还原循环来实现的。

当使用CO2代替O2作为氧化剂时，机理会发生变化。CO2是一种较温和的氧化剂，可以帮助避免过度氧化。它可以通过逆水气变换反应来再生催化剂，消耗脱氢过程中产生的H2。

对于CO2的活化，CeO2由于其直接裂解C=O键的能力而显得特别有效。这可能发生在氧空位处。Fe-Ni等过渡金属簇也显示出前景，Fe-Ni表面有利于C-H活化，而含Pt表面有利于C-C裂解。

不同催化剂在活化CO2用于丙烷ODH的有效性取决于它们的表面性质和裂解C=O键的能力。由于氧的移动性和空位的形成，CeO2和Fe掺杂CeO2表现出良好的性能。Fe-Ni等双金属系统在ODH和竞争反应之间的选择性方面提供了可调性。

总的来说，在精心设计的催化剂（如Fe掺杂CeO2）上使用CO2作为温和氧化剂进行ODH反应，与传统的O2 ODH相比，可以获得更好的稳定性和选择性。关键是通过合理的催化剂设计来平衡C-H活化、CO2解离和抑制过度氧化途径。
