[1] "The use of CO2 as, alternative to oxygen, soft oxidant has the potential to i) avoid deep oxidation of alkanes/alkenes, ii) reduce coke formation and iii) favor propane conversion due to participation of the produced hydrogen in the reverse water-gas shift reaction (RWGS)."

[2] "DFT calculations suggested that Fe-Ni surface favors C-H bond scissoring while Pt-determined surface favors C-C cleavage."

[3] "Pioneering work by the research group of JG Chen has provided molecular level understanding on light alkane CO2 assisted ODH over non-precious metal (Fe-Ni) and precious metal (Fe-Pt, Ni-Pt) over CeO2"

[4] "CeO2 as the most promising support due to its ability to activate CO2 via direct C=O bond scission."

[5] "Olefin selectivity was found to depend on competitive reaction pathways such as ODH, reverse water gas shift as well as alkane dry reforming that can be tuned via rational selection of the bimetallic composition of active sites."

The mechanisms of C-H bond activation and catalyst regeneration differ between redox-active and redox-inactive metal oxide catalysts in oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of alkanes. 

For redox-active catalysts like V2O5 and VOx/SiO2, the Mars-van Krevelen mechanism typically operates. This involves the lattice oxygen of the metal oxide participating in C-H bond activation, followed by catalyst re-oxidation by gas-phase oxygen. The catalyst undergoes redox cycles during the reaction.

In contrast, redox-inactive catalysts like CeO2 cannot easily change oxidation states. They likely operate via a different mechanism where surface oxygen species or defect sites activate C-H bonds. Regeneration occurs through gas-phase oxygen replenishing surface oxygen.

When using CO2 instead of O2 as the oxidant, the mechanisms change. CO2 acts as a softer oxidant that can avoid deep oxidation of products. It participates in the reverse water-gas shift reaction, which favors alkane conversion. 

Different catalysts show varying effectiveness in activating CO2 for propane ODH:

- CeO2 is considered highly promising due to its ability to directly cleave the C=O bond in CO2.
- Fe-Ni bimetallic catalysts on CeO2 favor C-H bond activation.
- Pt-containing bimetallic catalysts tend to promote C-C cleavage instead.

The bimetallic composition can be tuned to balance competitive pathways like ODH, reverse water-gas shift, and dry reforming to optimize olefin selectivity. Overall, CO2 activation appears to occur more readily on CeO2-based catalysts compared to traditional metal oxides, making them attractive for CO2-assisted ODH reactions.

在烷烃的氧化脱氢(ODH)反应中,氧化还原活性和非氧化还原活性金属氧化物催化剂的C-H键活化和催化剂再生机理是不同的。

对于V2O5和VOx/SiO2等氧化还原活性催化剂,通常遵循Mars-van Krevelen机理。这涉及金属氧化物的晶格氧参与C-H键活化,然后由气相氧重新氧化催化剂。催化剂在反应过程中经历氧化还原循环。

相比之下,像CeO2这样的非氧化还原活性催化剂不能轻易改变氧化态。它们可能通过不同的机理运作,其中表面氧物种或缺陷位点活化C-H键。再生是通过气相氧补充表面氧来实现的。

当使用CO2而不是O2作为氧化剂时,机理发生变化。CO2作为一种较弱的氧化剂,可以避免产物的深度氧化。它参与逆水煤气反应,有利于烷烃转化。

不同的催化剂在活化CO2用于丙烷ODH方面显示出不同的效果:

- CeO2由于其直接裂解CO2中C=O键的能力而被认为是非常有前途的。
- CeO2上的Fe-Ni双金属催化剂有利于C-H键活化。
- 含Pt的双金属催化剂倾向于促进C-C键裂解。

可以调节双金属组成以平衡ODH、逆水煤气反应和干重整等竞争性反应途径,以优化烯烃选择性。总的来说,与传统金属氧化物相比,CO2在基于CeO2的催化剂上的活化似乎更容易发生,这使得它们在CO2辅助ODH反应中具有吸引力。
