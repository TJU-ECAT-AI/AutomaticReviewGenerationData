Abstract
A 10% Mo/Si−Ti catalyst was tested for ethane oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) activity using either O2 or N2O as the oxidant. Ethane ODH activity was tested at contact times varying from 0.46 to 1.0 mg min/cm−3. N2O gives superior ethylene selectivities at a given ethane conversion outperforming oxygen at all contact times tested. Ethylene selectivities decrease with contact time at a far slower rate when using N2O as the oxidant. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) experiments demonstrate that molybdenum in the catalyst is fully oxidized to Mo(VI) during ethane ODH using O2, whereas the reduction state decreases to an average of +5.8 when using N2O as the oxidant. Temperature-programmed oxidation experiments of pre-reduced 10% Mo/Si−Ti were carried out at different temperature ramp rates. The activation energy of re-oxidation when using N2O is 98 kJ/mol, whereas that of O2 is 41 kJ/mol leading to a re-oxidation rate at least 1700 times faster when O2 is the oxidant. This difference in rates accounts for the less oxidized state of molybdenum during ethane ODH with N2O and explains the behavior observed during reaction experiments.

1 Introduction
The chemical industry relies heavily on unsaturated hydrocarbons as feedstock for many industrially significant processes. Oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of alkanes offers an attractive alternative to the traditional technologies of steam cracking, catalytic cracking, and catalytic dehydrogenation which are all endothermic, require high temperatures, and lead to coke formation. The ODH reaction is exothermic, and the presence of oxygen prevents coke formation leading to catalyst stability with time-on-stream. Selectivity control, however, is a major challenge, and olefin yields are limited by their undesired combustion to form CO and CO2.
Vanadium and molybdenum are the most often used active metals for low-temperature ODH of lower alkanes. Vanadium has been the subject of many ODH studies, (1-4) whereas molybdenum has been studied less often. (5, 6) Supporting the active metal on an inert substrate can significantly alter its activity. Good ODH performance has been achieved by supporting the active metal on a mixed oxide support which provides the necessary complex functionality. (7, 8) Silica−titania mixed oxide, in particular, has been studied due to its high surface area, thermal stability, and mechanical stability. (9, 10) Previous research has shown that a mixed oxide sol−gel catalyst containing 10 wt% molybdenum and silica and titania at a 1:1 molar ratio is quite active and selective for the oxidative dehydrogenation of lower alkanes, particularly when doped with potassium or chlorine. (11-14) In addition to the catalyst structure, the choice of oxidant can have interesting effects on ODH performance. Lunsford and co-workers studied N2O dissociation on a number of catalysts including MoOx/SiO2 and MgO. (15-17) They suggest that N2O dissociates to predominantly form O− species and that these O− species are able to undergo exchange with oxide ions in the lattice of MoOx/SiO2 catalysts. (18) They have used N2O during ethane ODH and methane partial oxidation and observed activities and selectivities that differ from those obtained using molecular oxygen over these MoOx/SiO2 catalysts. (15) They conclude that the O− species is formed on molybdenum reduced to the Mo5+ state and that O− is the active form of oxygen for C2H6 dehydrogenation. This conflicts with the more common view that lattice oxygen is responsible for C2H6 dehydrogenation.
More recently, propane ODH has been carried out on vanadium catalysts using N2O as the oxidant, yielding improved propylene selectivities. Using UV−vis spectroscopy, Kondratenko and co-workers (19-21) have demonstrated that VOx/Al2O3, VOx/SiO2 (including MCM-41 and MCM-48), and bulk vanadates (VO2, V2O3, and V2O5) operate in a more reduced state when N2O is used as the oxidant. The increase in propylene selectivity is attributed to this decrease in catalyst oxidation state. On the basis of density functional theory (DFT), Rozanska et al. (22) have proposed that oxygen is able to form a peroxovanadate species that N2O cannot. This peroxovanadate is considered active for the oxidation of propylene and may explain the decreased selectivity when using O2.
The present study examines the effect of using N2O and O2 as oxidant during ethane ODH on a molybdenum-based catalyst. Special emphasis is placed on the effect of oxidant on the structure of the catalyst and on the kinetics of the ethane ODH reaction. With these goals in mind, steady-state ethane ODH using O2 or N2O as oxidant was performed at various contact times and various oxidant concentrations. Catalyst structure was characterized using post-reaction X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and temperature-programmed reduction and re-oxidation experiments (TPR/TPO) monitored with laser Raman spectroscopy.
2 Experimental Methods
2.1 Catalyst Synthesis
A previously described one-pot sol−gel/coprecipitation technique was used to prepare a 10 wt% Mo/Si−Ti catalyst. (14, 23) Tetraethylorthosilicate (TEOS), from Aldrich, and titanium(IV)isopropoxide (TIPO), also from Aldrich, were placed in a 1:1 volume mixture of ethyl and propyl alcohol. TEOS and TIPO were added in quantities such that the molar ratio of SiO2 to TiO2 would be 1:1. The solution was continually stirred using a PTFE magnetic stir bar. While stirring, an aqueous solution containing ammonium heptamolybdate, from Mallinckrodt, was slowly added dropwise using a syringe pump. Ammonium heptamolybdate was added in a quantity such that the final catalyst contained 10 wt% molybdenum. A controlled inorganic polymerization reaction occurred, dispersing molybdenum through the silica/titania network. The solution was allowed to stir for 15 min after the entirety of the ammonium heptamolybdate solution had been added. The resulting gel was then dried in an oven at 110 °C overnight. After drying, the catalyst was ground into a fine powder using a mortar and pestle. The powder was then calcined at 550 °C in air for 5 h to oxidize the sample and remove any remaining organics.
2.2 Catalyst Activity Testing
Steady-state activity measurements were conducted using either O2 or N2O to determine their relative performance in the ethane oxidative dehydrogenation reaction. An amount of 50 mg of 10% Mo/Si−Ti catalyst was mixed thoroughly with 250 mg of quartz powder and placed into a fixed-bed quartz reactor with quartz frit bed. A type K thermocouple in contact with the upstream side of the catalyst bed was used to measure temperature. In all experiments, ethane conversion was kept below 5%.
Experiments were run at 600 °C at differing contact times. Contact times were changed by varying the total gas flow rate (using Brooks 5850E mass flow controllers) while maintaining the relative concentrations of each gas-phase component. The gas-phase compositions were 5% C2H6, 2.5% O2, and balance helium or 5% C2H6, 5% N2O, and balance helium. A separate set of steady-state experiments was run at 600 °C and a constant contact time of 0.625 mg min/cm3. During these experiments, ethane concentration was held constant at 5% while the oxidant concentration was varied.
In all experiments, dead volume within the reactor was filled with loosely packed quartz wool to minimize the possibility of homogeneous gas-phase reactions. Blank runs were conducted without catalyst using a quartz reactor packed with quartz wool. The results showed negligible ethane conversion at the feed conditions studied. Feed and effluent composition analyses were conducted using an Agilent 3000A micro gas chromatograph (GC) equipped with 0.32 mm PLOT molsieve and 0.32 mm PLOT Q columns with backflush and variable volume injectors, respectively. Both columns used thermal conductivity detectors (TCD). GC data points were collected and averaged after 60 min on stream, and all carbon balances closed within ± 5%.
Ethane conversion (XC2H6), selectivity (Si), and yield (Yi) are all calculated based on atomic carbon as follows:
where ni is the molar flow rate of an arbitrary reaction product i, n0C2H6 is the molar flow rate of ethane into the reactor, and Ci is the number of carbon atoms contained in arbitrary reaction product i. On a graph of selectivity versus ethane conversion, the product with the higher selectivity at a given conversion will also have the higher yield.
2.3 Catalyst Characterization
Static surface area and pore volume measurements were made using a Micromeritics ASAP 2010 accelerated surface area and porosimetry instrument. Nitrogen was the adsorbent at liquid nitrogen temperature (77 K). N2 adsorption and desorption isotherms were collected at relative pressures (P/Po) between 0 and 1, whereas BET surface area was calculated using eight points lying on the adsorption isotherm between 0 and 0.1 P/Po. Samples were degassed under vacuum at 200 °C overnight before being analyzed.
The chemical state of molybdenum following ethane ODH was investigated by XPS. Post-reaction samples were prepared using the reaction system described in section 2.2. The steady-state reaction was carried out for 6 h at 600 °C, and the reaction feed was composed of 10% C2H6, 5% O2 (or 10% N2O), balance helium at 50 mL/min. At the end of 6 h, the reactor was flushed with helium (50 mL/min) for 30 min at 600 °C and cooled to room temperature under the same atmosphere. The reactor was then sealed under helium and transferred to a glovebox. The samples were pressed into stainless steel sample cups inside the glovebox and transferred to the vacuum chamber. X-ray photoelectron spectra were collected using a Kratos Axis Ultra spectrometer operated at 13 kV and 10 mA using Al Kα radiation. Data analysis with background subtraction and curve fitting was done on XPSPeak 4.1. Doublet splitting for all deconvoluted Mo 3d peaks was held constant at 3.2 eV, and the area ratio between 3d5/2 and 3d3/2 was held constant at 3:2. For each spectrum, the counts per second were divided by the number of sweeps and the transmission value at that binding energy. This allowed peak area ratios to be compared between spectra.
Laser Raman spectra (LRS) were acquired using a Horiba-Jovin Yvon LabRam HR confocal Raman spectrometer with 800 mm focal length. The spectrometer was equipped with a 50× long working distance microscope objective, 1200 mm grating, He−Ne red laser (633 nm), argon ion laser (514 and 482 nm), and a Peltier-cooled CCD camera. Spectra were collected using the 633 nm line by averaging 50 scans with an acquisition time of 8 s and a power of less than 5 mW at the sample. The 10% Mo/Si−Ti sample was pretreated in situ in a Linkam Scientific CCR1000 catalyst cell reactor with quartz window and an alumina/silica sample cup. The sample was treated under 10% O2/He at 500 °C for 30 min and then cooled to room temperature under helium before being reduced in 5% H2/He using a 10 °C/min ramp rate to 550 °C. The pretreatment ensures that the catalyst surface is dehydrated and that any other adsorbed species arising from exposure to ambient air are removed. The sample was then cooled to room temperature under helium before a temperature-programmed oxidation experiment was performed in either 5% O2/He or 10% N2O/He using a 10 °C/min ramp rate to 550 °C. Raman spectra were collected at room temperature before the experiment, after the reduction step, and after the re-oxidation steps.
Temperature-programmed oxidation of pre-reduced 10% Mo/Si−Ti was carried out in a quartz reactor with a quartz frit bed using a fast response furnace (Carbolite, MTF 10/15/130) for precise temperature control. A microGC (Agilent 3000A) equipped with molecular sieve and plot Q columns and programmed for fast analysis was utilized for quantitative determination of oxidant consumption. The microGC was used because of its ability to quantitatively measure N2O and O2 concentrations and because of its reproducibility and accuracy. The pre-reduced catalyst samples were prepared in situ by reduction of 150 mg of sample in 5% H2/He (40 mL/min) using a temperature ramp rate of 10 °C/min and a set point and hold time of 550 °C and 30 min, respectively. The reactor was then flushed with helium (40 mL/min) for another 30 min at 550 °C and cooled to room temperature under the same atmosphere. The feed, consisting of 4% N2O or 2% O2 in helium (40 mL/min), was then introduced to the reactor at room temperature. The temperature program was started 30 min after the introduction of the oxidizing agent to the reactor. The same experiment was repeated with different heating rates to determine the activation energy for the re-oxidation of 10% Mo/Si−Ti using N2O and O2. The temperature program was as follows: holding for 30 min at room temperature; heating at 10, 13, 16, or 19 °C/min to 630 °C, and holding at 630 °C for 20 min. During both reduction and re-oxidation of the catalyst, the line from the reactor to the microGC was heated to 100 °C with a heating cord to prevent condensation. Activation energies of re-oxidation with O2 and N2O were estimated using the Kissinger method. (24) In this method, a series of temperature-programmed experiments are run at various temperature ramp rates (β). The activation energy of the oxidation process can be estimated using the temperature at which the maximum oxidant conversion occurs (Tmax). A plot of 1/Tmax vs ln(β/Tmax2) yields a straight line giving a slope of −EA/R, where −EA is the activation energy and R is the universal gas constant.
3 Results and Discussion
3.1 Steady-State Activity
N2 adsorption/desorption isotherms (not shown) were collected for 10% Mo/Si−Ti. The results are clearly identifiable as type IV according to the IUPAC classification system indicating a mesoporous material with pores in the range of 2−50 nm. BET measurements indicate a surface area of 130 m2/g in agreement with previous results on this catalyst, (25) and the BJH adsorption calculations indicate a pore size distribution centered at 5 nm.
The catalytic activity of 10% Mo/Si−Ti for ethane ODH was determined at 600 °C at contact times ranging from 0.46 to 1.0 mg min/cm3 using O2 or N2O as oxidant. The feed concentrations for these experiments were C2H6/O2/He = 5/2.5/92.5 and C2H6/N2O/He = 5/5/90. The sole reaction products during all reaction experiments were C2H4, CO, and CO2. Figure 1 shows the ethane conversion for each oxidant as a function of contact time. Regardless of the oxidant used, ethane conversion increases monotonically with contact time. Ethane conversion, when using oxygen, varies from 2.8% at 0.46 mg min/cm3 to 4.3% at 1.0 mg min/cm3. When using N2O, the ethane conversion varies from 2.4% at 0.46 mg min/cm3 to 4.1% at 1.0 mg min/cm3. At a given contact time, ODH reactions run using oxygen always show greater ethane conversion than reactions run using nitrous oxide.

Figure 2 shows the selectivities for CO, CO2, and C2H4 as a function of ethane conversion when using either O2 or N2O as oxidant. The main product observed when altering contact times was ethylene regardless of the oxidant used. Ethylene selectivities are always 75% and above, whereas the next most abundant product, CO, always has selectivities of 15% and below. The results were reproducible within 5%. Ethylene selectivity is higher when using nitrous oxide than when using oxygen regardless of the ethane conversions achieved in these experiments. When ethane conversion is 4.2% using N2O, ethylene selectivity is 85%, whereas the experiment using O2 achieves a selectivity of 83% at a much lower ethane conversion of 2.8% (the lowest conversion achieved when using O2). At low ethane conversion, ethylene selectivity reaches as high as 88% when using nitrous oxide. Oxygen, on the other hand, starts at an ethylene selectivity of 83% at low ethane conversion and decreases with increasing conversion until reaching 75% at 4.3% ethane conversion. It should be noted that, while using oxygen, the ethylene selectivity decreases much more quickly with increasing ethane conversion than when using nitrous oxide.

Reactions run using C2/O2/He = 5/2.5/92.5 and C2/N2O/He = 5/5/90 are represented by dashed and solid lines, respectively. Selectivities of ethylene, CO, and CO2 are represented by ◼, ●, and ▲, respectively.
Carbon monoxide is the second most abundant product, and its selectivity is always higher when using oxygen as oxidant during ethane ODH. CO selectivity varies from 12% to 15% at ethane conversions of 2.8% and 4.3%, respectively. When using nitrous oxide, on the other hand, CO selectivity varies from 10% to 11% at ethane conversions of 2.4% and 4.2%, respectively. CO2 selectivity is the lowest of all the products and, like carbon monoxide, it is more abundant when using O2 as oxidant. CO2 selectivity varies from 4.3% to 9.5% as ethane conversion varies from 2.8% to 4.7% when using oxygen. When using N2O, CO2 selectivity varies from 2.5% to 3.8% at 2.4% and 4.2% ethane conversion, respectively.
It is interesting to note that, when using N2O as the oxidant, the product distribution is relatively invariant to ethane conversion. Though ethylene selectivity does decrease slightly and CO and CO2 selectivities increase slightly with increasing ethane conversion, the trend is far less pronounced than when O2 is used as oxidant, such that the change in selectivity is at least twice as high when using O2 as opposed to N2O. While changing the contact time has a similar effect on ethane conversion regardless of oxidant, the effect of contact time on selectivity is far more pronounced when using O2.
The inverse relationship between ethane conversion and ethylene selectivity is well-known and widely reported in the literature. (2, 26, 27) This phenomenon is due to the consecutive conversion of ethylene to CO and CO2. The smaller decrease in C2H4 selectivity in the presence of N2O suggests that the consecutive oxidation of C2H4 is suppressed when using nitrous oxide. When using O2, on the other hand, the consecutive oxidation of C2H4 proceeds more quickly. The increase in CO and CO2 selectivities is similar when using the same oxidant. This suggests that CO and CO2 are both formed from the consecutive oxidation of ethylene though they are not formed exclusively from this reaction.
Steady-state ethane ODH experiments were run at a constant ethane concentration of 5% and a varying concentration of oxidant. Figure 3 shows ethane conversion during ODH as a function of atomic O to C2H6 ratio. When using oxygen as the oxidant, the ethane conversion and ethylene yield change by 2% and 1% relative, respectively, as the O/C2H6 ratio changes from 0.5 to 2.0. When using nitrous oxide as oxidant, the ethane conversion and ethylene yield increase by over 25% and 24% relative, respectively, as the O/C2H6 ratio changes from 0.5 to 2.0.

The results shown in Figure 3 for O2 are not surprising considering that numerous studies have shown that varying oxygen concentration during ODH of ethane has no effect on the olefin formation rate. (4, 28) This is due to the vastly different time scales involved in catalyst oxidation by oxygen and catalyst reduction by C2H6. Transient reaction experiments monitored by UV−vis have suggested that oxygen can oxidize the surface at rates of 103−105 times faster than the rate-limiting C−H bond abstraction step over an alumina-supported vanadium catalyst. (29) Even at relatively low O2 concentrations the catalyst is fully oxidized, and increasing O2 concentration does not result in any greater degree of catalyst oxidation. The results shown in Figure 3 suggest that when using N2O as oxidant in ethane ODH the re-oxidation step becomes kinetically relevant. It is conceivable that this step is kinetically relevant because of slower catalyst re-oxidation when using N2O. This possibility is explored in detail in sections 3.2, 3.3, and 3.4.
3.2 Post-reaction Oxidation State
In order to investigate the oxidation state of the 10% Mo/Si−Ti catalysts during ODH, post-reaction XPS analyses were conducted after steady-state ethane ODH using either O2 or N2O as oxidant. XPS spectrum of fresh 10% Mo/Si−Ti (not shown) shows a single doublet at 232.8 and 236.0 eV corresponding to Mo 3d5/2 and 3d3/2 peaks, respectively. (30, 31) This indicates that the “as-prepared” catalyst has molybdenum fully oxidized to Mo(VI) on the surface. Figure 4a shows the deconvoluted Mo 3d spectrum for post-reaction ethane ODH using oxygen as the oxidant. The spectrum shows one doublet characteristic of Mo(VI) located at 232.8 and 236.0 eV corresponding to the Mo 3d5/2 and 3d3/2 peaks, respectively. There are no indications of additional peaks. These results show that the 10% Mo/Si−Ti catalyst was operating at a molybdenum oxidation state of 6+ and that the catalyst surface is not reduced when exposed to helium before transfer to the XPS chamber.
Figure 4
Figure 4. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy of Mo 3d region collected after steady-state ethane ODH: (a) C2/O2/He = 10/5/85; (b) C2/N2O/He = 10/10/80.
The deconvoluted Mo 3d spectrum for post-reaction ethane ODH using nitrous oxide as oxidant is shown in Figure 4b. This spectrum, in contrast to post-oxygen ODH, shows multiple molybdenum doublets. The intense Mo(VI) doublet is still present at 232.8 and 326.0 eV corresponding to Mo 3d5/2 and 3d3/2 peaks, respectively. Now, however, the Mo(VI) 3d5/2 peak has a distinct shoulder on the low binding energy side. The deconvolution shows that there is a doublet at 230.7 and 233.8 eV with the lower binding energy peak component accounting for this shoulder. This doublet at 230.7 and 233.8 eV is associated with Mo(V) 3d5/2 and 3d3/2 peaks, respectively. A peak due to Mo(IV) 3d5/2 is also clearly seen at 229.2 eV, and the corresponding 3d3/2 peak is located at 232.4 eV. (30, 31)
The XPS results indicate that molybdenum is in a lower oxidation state in the post-N2O oxidative dehydrogenation sample. The post-N2O sample contained Mo(VI), Mo(V), and Mo(IV), whereas the post-O2 sample appeared fully oxidized with only Mo(VI) appearing. The post-N2O ODH catalyst has peak area ratios of Mo(VI)/Mo(V)/Mo(IV) = 84/8.3/7.7 corresponding to an average molybdenum oxidation state of 5.8. Similar XPS results have been reported on vanadium catalyst during propane ODH with N2O. (32) Sixteen percent of the molybdenum atoms detected by XPS are reduced after post-N2O ODH. Kondratenko and co-workers (19, 21) have reported similar results using UV−vis. Their vanadia catalysts were in a more reduced state when using N2O as the oxidant in propane ODH. This may suggest that N2O is either unable to oxidize certain sites or that the oxidation of the catalyst is slower leaving a greater fraction of sites reduced. It should also be noted that we observed visible changes in color of post-N2O ODH 10% Mo/Si−Ti. Fresh 10% Mo/Si−Ti is white, and the color remains unchanged after ODH using O2. After ODH using N2O, however, the catalyst color has become purple, and it is well-known that MoO2 is violet in color.
Clearly, the working oxidation state of the catalyst is different when performing ODH with O2 or N2O. It is widely accepted that the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane over easily reducible transition metal oxides proceeds via a Mars−van-Krevelen redox mechanism. Argyle et al. (4) have suggested that during ethane ODH on vanadium catalysts, the catalyst surface is reduced as lattice oxygen atoms activate ethane molecules, ultimately forming olefins. Ethane must first adsorb (reaction 1) to a surface or lattice oxygen atom (O*), and a C−H bond must be cleaved forming an ethoxy intermediate and a hydroxyl group on the catalyst surface (reaction 2). This initial cleavage of the ethane C−H bond is considered the rate-limiting step, and the literature consistently shows that ethylene formation rates are first order in ethane concentration. (4, 33) The ethoxy intermediate, which is adsorbed to an oxygen atom, then loses a second hydrogen atom forming ethylene and another hydroxyl group on the catalyst surface (reaction 3). Finally, two hydroxyl groups combine to form water and a lattice vacancy (V*) leaving the active site in a reduced state (reaction 4). Gas-phase oxygen must then adsorb to a vacancy and reoxidize the active site (reaction 5).

Changes in oxidation state could account for the behavior observed in Figure 2. During ODH, a catalyst in a more oxidized state would have a greater number of reactive lattice oxygen atoms. Therefore, when the ethane conversion is increased, the ethylene that is formed would have access to many reactive lattice oxygen atoms, making ethylene relatively likely to be further oxidized. During N2O ODH, the ethylene molecule would be near fewer lattice oxygen atoms making ethylene less likely to be oxidized to CO or CO2. This could account for the relative invariance in product selectivities versus ethane conversion (Figure 2) when using N2O as the oxidant. This is a concept known as site isolation and was originally proposed by Grasselli (34, 35) to account for hydrocarbon oxidation and ammoxidation. Callahan and Grasselli (35) stated that oxidation catalysts become selective when the number of active oxygen species on the surface are limited and when these species are spatially isolated from one another. The site isolation concept is often applied to the preparation of catalysts of a specific “selective” structure. Bordes (36) has worked extensively on this topic and has reviewed, in detail, the concept as it applies to n-butane selective oxidation to maleic anhydride. It is conceivable that a catalyst with a greater degree of reduction could possess fewer active oxygen sites capable of further oxidizing the resulting olefin molecules. This has been proposed as one possible explanation for the improved selectivities when using N2O in propane ODH over vanadia. (19-21, 37) Regardless of which oxidation agent is used, as ethane conversion increases, the concentration of ethylene also increases. This higher concentration results in an increased rate of ethylene combustion and a lower selectivity to ethylene. This effect is more prominent in the case of O2; therefore, the selectivity to ethylene decreases with a steeper slope as the conversion increases. When N2O is the oxidizing agent, however, molybdenum is more reduced, and the availability of oxygen controls the ethylene oxidation more than the ethylene concentration. Therefore, the rate of ethylene combustion is lower during ODH with N2O resulting in a higher ethylene selectivity. While discussing the effect of the type of oxidant on the ethane ODH activity of Mo/Si−Ti, it is also worthwhile to note that the contribution of mass transfer related limitations to the observed activity should be recognized in addition to the difference between the intrinsic catalytic activities of the sample under different oxidants. Another possible explanation that has arisen from DFT studies on propane over supported vanadium catalysts suggests the existence of a peroxovanadate intermediate when using O2 as the oxidant. (22) It has been reported that these peroxovanadate species, which are active for propane oxidation and 10−100 times more active for propene oxidation, cannot form in the presence of N2O. This type of species could account for the greater decrease in ethylene selectivity as a function of ethane conversion when using O2 as the oxidant. Peroxomolybdate species have been observed in solution by Raman spectroscopy and 95Mo NMR. (38-40) It is possible that O2 is forming active peroxomolybdate species during the re-oxidation process. The absence of peroxomolybdate species could account for a higher selectivity when using N2O.
The XPS results are also consistent with the ODH reaction data collected at different oxidant concentrations (Figure 3). When using O2 as the oxidant, increasing the O2 concentration does not lead to an increase in ethylene formation rate because the molybdenum is already fully oxidized. When using N2O as the oxidant, however, an increase in concentration of N2O will increase the rate of catalyst re-oxidation. This will lead to a steady state with a higher proportion of oxidized molybdenum. In a Mars−van Krevelen mechanism, the rate of ethane C−H bond activation is proportional to the number of active oxygen sites on the catalyst surface.
3.3 Characterization of 10% Mo/Si−Ti during Reduction and Re-oxidation
Temperature-programmed reduction and re-oxidation experiments were performed to determine the redox properties of the 10% Mo/Si−Ti catalyst. Temperature-programmed reduction of 10% Mo/Si−Ti in 5% H2/N2 gives a single hydrogen consumption peak located at 460 °C (see the inset in Figure 5) suggesting a single reduction step. Figure 5 shows the re-oxidation of 10% Mo/Si−Ti using 2% O2/He or 4% N2O/He. The results for oxygen and nitrous oxide both show a single oxidant consumption peak suggesting a single oxidation step. O2 is able to oxidize the 10% Mo/Si−Ti at much lower temperatures than N2O. O2 consumption reaches a maximum at 265 °C, whereas the N2O peak does not reach a maximum until 481 °C, suggesting that oxygen is a stronger oxidizing agent than nitrous oxide. The result supports the conclusions reached from steady-state ethane ODH and post-reaction XPS that the catalyst re-oxidation was kinetically relevant when using N2O and that molybdenum was at a more reduced state after using N2O as oxidant.

During the nitrous oxide TPO, a total of 0.16 mmol of atomic oxygen was consumed, whereas the O2 TPO showed a total of 0.15 mmol of atomic oxygen consumed. These values correspond to the oxidation of all the molybdenum in the sample from Mo(IV) to Mo(VI) to within 5% for both oxidants. These results suggest that the peaks observed in both the TPR and TPO experiments are due to the catalyst oxidation state changing from Mo(VI) to Mo(IV) and vice versa. It is interesting to note that, according to the measured N2O consumption, nitrous oxide is able to fully oxidize the molybdenum in 10% Mo/Si−Ti from Mo(IV) to Mo(VI) even though the oxidation does not occur until a higher temperature.
The structure of molybdenum in the 10% Mo/Si−Ti catalyst was monitored using Raman spectroscopy before and after reduction by 5% H2/N2 (see Figure 6). The fresh pre-reduced catalyst shows a band at 635 cm−1 corresponding to anatase titania. Previous research on this catalyst using X-ray diffraction has shown a broad anatase titania band indicating its presence in a finely dispersed state. (13) A broad weak band from 750 to 950 cm−1 can be assigned to the Mo−O−Mo asymmetric stretch and the Si−O−Si symmetric stretch. (25) The band located at 995 cm−1 is due to terminal Mo═O groups. Previous work on this catalyst has shown that crystalline molybdenum will not form until loading levels of 20 wt% molybdenum. (41) Crystalline MoO3 is a very strong scatterer and would be easily detected by sharp, intense bands at 820 and 995 cm−1. After reduction in hydrogen, the signal intensity decreases significantly. Therefore, the spectrum of the reduced sample was collected using longer acquisition times and more scans than the other spectra. Though the intensity of all bands has decreased, the same bands as the fresh catalyst are observed. Recent literature has demonstrated that molybdenum on silica supports possess dioxo species with two terminal oxygen bonds (42, 43) ((Si−O)2Mo═(O)2). The oxidant consumption from the TPR/TPO results presented above suggest that the catalyst is reduced from Mo(VI) to Mo(IV). With this extent of reduction, and assuming that at least some of the molybdenum is in a dioxo structure, Mo═O terminal bonds would remain.

The catalyst structure was also monitored after re-oxidation by N2O or O2. The observed bands are identical for the pre-reduced catalyst, the catalyst reoxidized with O2, and the catalyst reoxidized with N2O. Bands are still observed at 635, 820, and 995 cm−1 but the sharp, intense bands located at 995 and 820 cm−1 associated with crystalline MoO3 are not present. This suggests that both oxygen and nitrous oxide are able to restore the molybdenum to its pre-reduction state. Apparently molybdenum atoms bound to the support and not able to aggregate together to form metallic molybdenum at the reduction temperatures used in this study. Given that crystalline molybdenum is an extremely strong Raman scatterer, its formation would be readily visible in the Raman spectrum. These results agree with the TPR and TPO results that indicated reduction of Mo(VI) to Mo(IV) and subsequent re-oxidation back to the original state regardless of the oxidant used. Additionally, this provides evidence that the structure of the molybdenum species is not changing with reduction and re-oxidation regardless of oxidant used.
3.4 10% Mo/Si−Ti Activation Energies of Re-oxidation Using O2 and N2O
Temperature-programmed re-oxidation studies were performed at varying temperature ramp rates to determine activation energies of re-oxidation using N2O and O2. The 10% Mo/Si−Ti was pre-reduced in 5% H2/He before being oxidized in 2% O2/He or 4% N2O/He at ramp rates of 10, 13, 16, and 19 °C/min. Figure 7a shows O2 TPO experiments at varying heating rates. As heating rates increase, Tmax shifts higher, from 244 to 274 °C. Figure 7b shows that during N2O TPO experiments, Tmax shifts from 460.5 to 487.5 °C as heating rate increases from 10 to 19 °C/min. The insets in Figure 7, parts a and b, show plots of ln(β/Tmax2) versus 1/Tmax used to determine the activation energies of re-oxidation using O2 and N2O. Figure 7a inset gives a slope of −4.98, which corresponds to an activation energy of 41 kJ/mol for re-oxidation using O2. Figure 7b inset gives a slope of −11.76, which corresponds to an activation energy of 98 kJ/mol for re-oxidation using N2O.

The use of N2O as oxidant makes the activation energy of re-oxidation much closer to the apparent ODH activation energy, which suggests that the rates of catalyst re-oxidation and reduction will be much closer when using N2O as oxidant. Heracleous et al. (44) have shown that ethane ODH on titania- and alumina-supported molybdenum catalysts had apparent activation energies of 104 and 91 kJ/mol, respectively, using O2 as oxidant. Vanadia-based catalysts have been shown to have activation energies of 120 ± 15 kJ/mol during ethane ODH with O2. (45)
The TPO experiments show that the activation energy of re-oxidation using N2O is 2.4 times higher than that required when using O2. This difference likely accounts for the ability of O2 to oxidize the reduced sample at lower temperatures than N2O. At a given extent of conversion and temperature, we can calculate a rough estimate of differences in the TPO re-oxidation rates of O2 and N2O using the following equation:
where r is the rate or re-oxidation, k is the pre-exponential factor, and E is the activation energy of re-oxidation. Argyle et al. (29) suggested that the rate of re-oxidation during propane ODH with O2 was 103−105 times faster than the C−H bond breaking step. On the basis of our TPO activation energies and assuming equal pre-exponential factors, the O2 re-oxidation rate would be approximately 1700 times faster than the N2O re-oxidation rate at 550 °C.
N2O can adsorb to the catalyst surface either through a nitrogen atom or the oxygen atom. DFT calculations on a vanadia-based catalyst have suggested that adsorbed N2O is more stable when adsorbed via a nitrogen atom but only decomposes when adsorbed through an oxygen atom. (22) This limitation in the orientations that lead to reaction would result in a decreased pre-exponential factor relative to oxygen. Additionally, the nonreactive adsorption of N2O would lead to a decrease in the number of sites available for re-oxidation by nitrous oxide and a further decrease in the re-oxidation rate. Therefore, we may expect the O2 pre-exponential factor to be greater than N2O so that the difference between re-oxidation rates would be even higher. The O2/N2O re-oxidation rate ratio of 1700, arrived at by assuming equal pre-exponential factors, serves as a lower boundary for the actual value. On the basis of these results, we can expect that re-oxidation with N2O proceeds much more slowly than when using O2 and that the re-oxidation step is no longer kinetically decoupled from the reduction process.
Considering that N2O has a higher activation energy of oxidation and a higher enthalpy of formation than O2, the transition state that O2 passes through must be of lower energy than that available to N2O. The most obvious choice of transition states available to O2 but not to N2O would be a peroxomolybdate-type species. Peroxomolybdates have been detected spectroscopically in liquid-phase reactions. (38-40) Additionally, a peroxomolybdate species has been suggested as an intermediate in the oxidation of reduced molybdenum with O2. (46) It is possible that the peroxomolybdate species could provide a low-energy transition state not accessible to nitrous oxide, but to the authors’ knowledge, there have been no theoretical studies of molybdenum oxidation using O2 and N2O that could help to confirm or refute this possibility.
4 Conclusions
Use of O2 or N2O as the oxidant was investigated over a Mo/Si−Ti catalyst for ethane oxidative dehydrogenation. N2O gives higher selectivities to ethylene than O2, and the selectivities decrease at a lower rate with increasing contact time. Additionally, the rate of ethylene formation increases with increasing N2O concentration but is constant with increasing O2 concentration. These ODH performances are attributed to the less oxidized state of the catalyst when using N2O as the oxidant, as evidenced by XPS. The activation energy of re-oxidation when using N2O is 2.5 times higher than when using O2. The rate of re-oxidation when using N2O is at least 1700 times greater as determined by activation energies calculated in temperature-programmed oxidation experiments. The experimentally measured re-oxidation rate in an N2O TPO is within an order of magnitude of the ethane consumption rate under similar conditions in steady-state ethane ODH experiments making the re-oxidation step kinetically relevant when using N2O as oxidant.
