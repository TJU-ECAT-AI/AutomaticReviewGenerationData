Abstract
Dry reforming is a potential process to convert CO2 and light alkanes into syngas (H2 and CO), which can be subsequently transformed to chemicals and fuels. In this work, PtNi bimetallic catalysts have been investigated for dry reforming of ethane and butane using both model surfaces and supported powder catalysts. The PtNi bimetallic catalyst shows an improvement in both activity and stability in comparison to the corresponding monometallic catalysts. The formation of PtNi alloy and the partial reduction of Ce4+ to Ce3+ under reaction conditions are demonstrated by in situ ambient-pressure X-ray photoemission spectroscopy (AP-XPS), X-ray diffraction (XRD), and X-ray absorption fine structure (XAFS) measurements. A Pt-rich bimetallic surface is revealed by diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy (DRIFTS) following CO adsorption. Combined in situ experimental results and density functional theory (DFT) calculations suggest that the Pt-rich PtNi bimetallic surface structure would weaken the binding of surface oxygenate/carbon species and reduce the activation energy for C–C bond scission, leading to an enhanced dry reforming activity.

1 Introduction
Catalytic conversion of CO2 to chemicals has been widely investigated (1-4) as a promising approach to migrate potential problems caused by global CO2 emission. Dry reforming of methane (DRM) is an attractive process, as it converts two greenhouse gases (CO2 and methane) into syngas (CO and H2), (5) which can be subsequently transformed into value-added chemicals and fuels by methanol or Fischer–Tropsch (FT) synthesis reactions. Supported precious metals (Pt, Ru, Rh, Pd) as well as inexpensive transition metals (Ni, Co, Fe) have been extensively explored as active DRM catalysts. (6) However, DRM is a highly endothermic reaction and requires high operating temperatures to attain considerable conversion, leading to rapid catalyst deactivation due to carbon deposition. (6) An alternative way to convert CO2 to syngas is to use ethane and other light hydrocarbons (e.g., butane) in shale gas. (7, 8) Dry reforming of ethane (DRE, eq 1) and dry reforming of butane (DRB, eq 2) produce syngas via

Under equilibrium conditions of stoichiometric ratio, the 50% conversion of CO2 in DRE and DRB can be reached at 761 and 717 K, respectively (Figure S1 in the Supporting Information), significantly lower than 863 K for DRM. The decrease in reaction temperatures provides more options in designing stable catalysts due to a lower extent of catalyst deactivation. These reactions also have important practical applications, as ethane and butane are commonly found in shale gas, typically about 10 and 0.2 wt %, respectively. (7, 8)
The modification of Ni-based catalysts is considered to be an effective way to increase the catalytic activity and stability. (8-11) Though catalysts with high loadings of precious metals (such as Pt) are generally uneconomical in large-scale processes, they typically show higher coking resistance and can be used to promote Ni-based catalysts in order to reduce carbon deposition and increase catalyst lifetime. Effective activation of CO2 is also a critical step in improving the overall reaction activity. It is generally believed that the activation of CO2 occurs at the support or the interfacial site between the active metal and the oxide support. Therefore, a key factor in activating CO2 is the reducibility of the metal oxides. (12) CeO2 is a highly reducible oxide, which can be readily reduced to Ce3+ thermally or chemically. (13, 14) The reduced oxide has a strong tendency to react with CO2, even causing direct C–O bond scission. The combination of bimetallic active sites over highly reducible oxides should increase the catalytic activity and coking resistance. However, little is known about the reaction and deactivation mechanisms when these catalysts are applied to DRE and DRB, which involve breaking both the C–H and C–C bonds, instead of only C–H scission in DRM.
In this study, dry reforming of ethane and butane on CeO2 model thin films and supported powder catalysts has been explored using both experiments and density functional theory (DFT) calculations. Multiple spectroscopic techniques, including in situ ambient-pressure X-ray photoemission spectroscopy (AP-XPS), in situ X-ray diffraction (XRD), in situ X-ray absorption fine structure (XAFS), and diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy (DRIFTS), are utilized to probe catalyst structures and surface species under reaction conditions. Kinetic studies using a flow reactor show that the PtNi/CeO2 catalyst is more active and stable for both DRE and DRB. The formation of the PtNi alloy is observed by both the in situ XRD and XAFS measurements. Ce3+ species under reaction conditions are identified by both in situ XRD and AP-XPS. DFT calculations are performed to further understand the reaction mechanisms. The improved activity and stability of PtNi/CeO2 over the corresponding monometallic catalysts can be attributed to the formation of the Pt-rich PtNi bimetallic surface, which decreases the activation energy of C–C bond scission and weakens the binding strength of adsorbed oxygenates.
2 Experimental and Theoretical Methods
2.1 AP-XPS on Model Surfaces
Thin films of PtNi/CeO2, Pt/CeO2, and Ni/CeO2 were prepared by depositing small coverages of PtNi, Pt, or Ni (0.1 ML) onto a CeO2 film (3 ML) over a TiO2(110) substrate at 303 K. After sample preparation, survey scans in XPS were recorded at a photon energy of 700 eV. During the reaction, the C 1s peaks in XPS were recorded at a photon energy of 538 eV. All reported binding energies were calibrated with the Au 4f7/2 peak of a gold foil at 84.0 eV. Low-pressure CO2 (100 mTorr) and butane (200 mTorr) were leaked into the chamber, and the subsequent surfaces with adsorbates were heated to 723 K. The surface carbon species generated by activation of CO2 and butane were probed by XPS spectra, which were taken at 303 K (before reaction) and 723 K (under reaction).
2.2 Preparation and Characterization of Supported Catalysts
The PtNi/CeO2 bimetallic catalyst (1.7 wt % for Pt and 1.5 wt % for Ni, corresponding to an atomic ratio of 1:3 for Pt:Ni) and Pt/CeO2 (1.7 wt % for Pt) and Ni/CeO2 (1.5 wt % for Ni) monometallic catalysts were synthesized by incipient wetness impregnation (15, 16) over as-is commercial support (CeO2, 35–45 m2/g, cubic, Sigma-Aldrich) with an aqueous solution of the respective metal precursors ((NH3)4Pt(NO3)2 and Ni(NO3)2·6H2O from Alfa Aesar).
Pulse CO chemisorption was performed using an Altamira AMI-300 iP catalyst characterization system to measure the number of reduced metal sites (i.e., active sites) on each supported catalyst. Temperature-programmed reduction (TPR) experiments using H2 were carried out in the same Altamira AMI-300 iP instrument to compare the reducibility of active metals in the supported catalysts.
In situ XRD measurements of the PtNi/CeO2 catalyst were performed using an amorphous silica capillary mounted to a flow cell setup, as described in detail in previous work. (17, 18) During the measurement, a gaseous mixture of C2H6, CO2, and He in a volume ratio of 1:5:4 was passed through the capillary at a total flow rate of 10 mL/min. The temperature was increased from 300 to 873 K at a rate of 10 K/min and then held at 873 K for 30 min before being ramped down to room temperature.
The in situ Pt L3 edge (11564 eV) and Ni K edge (8333 eV) XAFS spectra were collected at beamline 2-2 of the Stanford Synchrotron Radiation Lightsource (SSRL). A 50 mg portion of PtNi/CeO2 powder catalyst (60–80 mesh) was loaded into a 3 mm o.d. glassy-carbon tube, packed with quartz wool at both sides of the sample. The sample was first reduced under a H2/He flow (10 mL/min each) at 723 K for 30 min. To avoid the thermal disturbance at high temperature, the spectra (three scans) were collected after the sample was cooled down to 373 K under an H2/He flow. After measurement, the gas was switched to a mixture of reactants (10 mL/min of CO2, 5 mL/min of C2H6, and 5 mL/min of He), and then the sample was heated to 873 K at a rate of 20 K/min. After 60 min reaction, the sample was cooled to 373 K under the CO2/C2H6/He flow to take the XAFS spectra (three scans). The data were treated using the IFEFFIT package. Pt foil and Ni foil were employed as references of EXAFS fitting.
DRIFTS experiments were performed using an FTIR spectrometer (Thermo Nicolet 6700). The background spectrum for each catalyst was recorded at room temperature after reduction under a 25% H2/75% He mixture at 673 K. Following reduction, the sample was treated with a 25% CO/75% He mixture and then finally pure He. The sample spectrum was recorded after purging the reaction cell with He for 15 min.
Flow reactor studies of DRE and DRB over CeO2-supported catalysts were performed in a quartz tube reactor with an inner diameter of 4 mm under atmospheric pressure. Catalysts were reduced under a H2/Ar mixture at 873 K for 1 h prior to reaction. For steady-state measurements, the catalysts were held at 873 K for over 13 h. Then, the reaction temperature was changed from 873 to 843 K with 5 K increments, in order to study the effect of temperature on the reaction rate of CO2 and ethane/butane as well as to obtain the apparent activation energies. More details about the experimental methods are provided in the section S2 in the Supporting Information.
2.3 DFT Calculations
Periodic self-consistent DFT (19, 20) total energy calculations were carried out using the Vienna Ab initio Simulation Package (VASP) code. (21, 22) The Kohn–Sham one-electron wave functions were expanded by using a plane wave basis set with a kinetic energy cutoff of 400 eV. The Brillouin zone was sampled using a 3 × 3 × 1 Monkhorst–Pack k-point grid. (23) The exchange-correlation energy was described using projector augmented wave (PAW) potentials with the generalized gradient approximation (GGA) (24, 25) using PW91 functionals. (26) Spin polarized DFT calculations were performed to account for the magnetic nature of Ni atoms.
The Pt(111) and Ni(111) surfaces were modeled using a four-layer 3 × 3 unit cell, and the Pt-terminated-PtNi-Pt(111) surface was modeled by replacing subsurface (second layer) Pt atoms of the Pt(111) slab by Ni atoms. The mixed-PtNi-Pt(111) surface was modeled using a four-layer 4 × 4 surface slab, and it was modeled by replacing half of the Pt atoms in the top two layers of the Pt(111) surface with Ni atoms. A vacuum layer of ∼14 Å thickness was added in the unit cell along the direction perpendicular to the surface. During structure optimization calculations, the positions of the atoms in the bottom two surface layers were fixed while the positions of all the other atoms were fully relaxed until the Hellman–Feynman force on each ion was smaller than 0.02 eV/Å. The binding energy of an adsorbate is calculated as

3 Results
3.1 AP-XPS on Model Surfaces
Figure 1 compares the XPS results of PtNi/CeO2, Pt/CeO2, and Ni/CeO2 model surfaces after sample preparation and under reaction conditions. Due to the stronger interaction of butane in comparison to ethane with the model surfaces, the reaction of butane with CO2 was investigated using AP-XPS. During the reaction, the chamber was filled with 100 mTorr CO2 and 200 mTorr butane. CeO2 was deposited on a TiO2(110) substrate by physical vapor deposition of Ce under an O2 atmosphere. After the deposition of approximately three layers of CeO2, Ti 3p from the TiO2 substrate was still visible in the spectra. After CeO2 was deposited, multiple Ce 4d peaks, due to spin–orbit splitting in the 4d orbitals, and different 4f orbitals (27) were observed. The peaks at 125.5 and 122.2 eV originated from the final state without any f electrons (f0), which is the typical XPS feature of CeO2. Under reaction conditions, the features at 125.5 and 122.2 eV decrease in intensity, indicating that some of the Ce4+ is reduced to Ce3+. After sample preparation, the oxidation of the active metals (Pt and Ni) was found for all surfaces. Reduction of metals (shifting to lower binding energy in XPS) was observed after reaction for all catalysts except for the Ni of Ni/CeO2. Interestingly, the Ni of PtNi/CeO2 was reduced to Ni0, indicating that the presence of Pt promotes Ni reduction.

Figure 2 shows the C 1s region for carbon species in the gas phase and the surface adsorbates on PtNi/CeO2, Pt/CeO2, and Ni/CeO2. After 100 mTorr CO2 and 200 mTorr butane were introduced at 303 K, three C 1s peaks were observed and their intensities varied for each surface. The peak at 292.4–292.6 eV is due to gas-phase CO2. The peak at 285.2 eV is assigned to gas-phase butane. The peak at 288.8–289.2 eV could be assigned as carbonate and carboxyl (CO2δ−), which have been identified by combined XPS and infrared reflection–absorption spectroscopy (IRRAS) measurements. (28) The observation of carbonates/carboxyl indicates that all three surfaces effectively activate CO2.

The C 1s spectra in red are the surface species after the surfaces were heated to 723 K in the CO2/butane mixture. Under reaction conditions there are mainly two peaks (289.8 and 284.5 eV) in the C 1s spectra. The feature due to gas-phase CO2 is barely visible, indicating that the reaction consumed most of the CO2 near the surface. The peak at 289.8 eV could be assigned to the adsorbed formate, (29) which was formed through the hydrogenation of adsorbed carbonate and carboxylate species. The unsymmetrical peak at 284.5 eV with its shoulder at 286.0 eV is assigned to the adsorbed O–CxHy species, generated from butane decomposition and surface oxidation at high temperatures. It is worth noting that the peak intensity of the adsorbed O–CxHy varies for different surfaces, following the trend PtNi/CeO2 > Ni/CeO2 > Pt/CeO2. This indicates that Ni is more active than Pt and the formation of the PtNi bimetallic surface further improves the activation of butane.
3.2 Supported Catalysts
3.2.1 TPR
TPR profiles of the three catalysts are shown in Figure 3. The profile of the Pt/CeO2 catalyst shows two peaks at 370 and 390 K. The peak at 370 K is assigned to the reduction of surface PtOx in contact with Pt0 species; (30) the peak at 390 K is attributed to the reduction of PtOx species formed during the calcination step. (31) A reduction peak at 561 K is observed for the Ni/CeO2 catalyst, which can be assigned to the reduction of NiO particles. (32) The PtNi/CeO2 catalyst exhibits reduction peaks pertaining to PtOx (387 K) and NiO (539 K). In comparison to the monometallic Ni/CeO2 catalyst, the reduction peak at 561 K is shifted to 539 K for the bimetallic catalyst. This indicates that the reduction of NiO species is promoted by the coimpregnated Pt. This suggests a synergistic interaction between the two metals, as indicated by the AP-XPS results in Figure 1. The formation of the bimetallic alloy on PtNi/CeO2 after reduction in hydrogen was confirmed in our previous work (15) by extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) characterizations.

3.2.2 In Situ XRD Characterization on PtNi/CeO2 Catalyst
The XRD pattern of the as-prepared PtNi/CeO2 sample reveals that it contains crystalline CeO2 with an average crystallite size of 19 nm. The size was calculated from the refined peak profile parameters using the GSAS software. Barely seen in the 2θ range of 7–9° are two humps that can be assigned to the (111) and (200) reflections of NiO, as shown in the inset in Figure 4. XRD signatures of Pt or Pt oxides are not observed in the starting sample. Also plotted in Figure 4 is the XRD pattern after the reaction with CO2 and ethane in the in situ XRD cell. The main differences are the appearance of three weak peaks between 8 and 9° of 2θ. The peak at 8.2° is assigned to the Pt(111) reflection, and the calculated lattice constant using this diffraction peak is 3.924 Å, the same value as that of bulk Pt metal. The peak at 8.8° is assigned to the Ni(111) reflection, on the basis of which the calculated lattice constant is 3.578 Å. This is slightly larger than the value of 3.527 Å for bulk Ni. The larger Ni cell parameter measured in this sample may indicate that the Ni particles are alloyed with Pt, or it is from the effect of having the size of nanoparticles. The peak in the middle of the three, at 8.5°, is not indexed to any known phases of Pt, Ni, Ce or their oxide forms. Considering that the position is between the Pt(111) and Ni(111) peaks, it is likely that the peak at 8.5° is associated with the formation of the PtNi alloy.
Figure 4
Figure 4. XRD profiles of PtNi/CeO2 bimetallic catalyst before (blue line) and after reaction (red line).
The change of the CeO2 lattice constant and the evolution of XRD profiles between 7 and 9° following the reaction of CO2 with ethane are plotted as a function of reaction temperature in Figure 5. As shown in Figure 5a, an abrupt lattice expansion occurred between 523 and 583 K, on top of an upward-sloping background line from the thermal effect. The abrupt expansion of the CeO2 lattice corresponds to an increase of the average Ce–O bond length, indicating a partial reduction of Ce4+ to Ce3+.
Figure 5
Figure 5. Change of the CeO2 lattice constant (a) and peak intensity of various phases (b) and evolution of XRD profiles between 7 and 9° (c) with an increase in temperature under the reaction atmosphere of CO2 with ethane.
As can be seen from the evolution of the hump centered at 8.2°, the reduction of amorphous Pt oxides starts at a temperature as low as 443 K. The reduction of the NiO phase can be tracked by following its (111) peak at 7.5° or Ni (111) peak at 8.8°, which does not show a clear decrease in intensity until above 533 K. The formation of the PtNi alloy (a broad hump centered at 8.5°) can be observed once the Pt oxides are reduced. This indicates that metallic Pt facilitates the reduction of NiO to Ni by decreasing the reduction temperature, where bulk NiO is usually reduced at around 673 K. (33) This observation is consistent with the TPR results (Figure 3), which illustrate that the presence of Pt decreases the reduction temperature of NiO. Moreover, the fact that the reduction temperature of surface CeO2 (523–583 K) is much lower in comparison to 723 K, the reduction temperature of pure ceria, (34) may also be attributed to the presence of Pt.
3.2.3 In Situ XAFS Measurement on PtNi/CeO2 Catalyst
As shown in Figure 6, the Pt L3 edge and Ni K edge XANES spectra of PtNi/CeO2 catalyst indicated that the active metals were reduced after 723 K H2 treatment. The XANES spectra also suggest that the valence state and local structure of both Pt and Ni remain relatively stable under reaction conditions at 873 K, although a slight increase at the “white line” was observed. Detailed EXAFS fittings of the Pt L3 edge and Ni K edge spectra were carried out to investigate the specific structure of Pt and Ni in the PtNi/CeO2 catalyst (Table 1). After H2 reduction at 723 K, the Pt L3 edge EXAFS fitting results suggest that Pt atoms form chemical bonds with both Pt (2.70 Å) and Ni (2.58 Å). The corresponding coordination numbers (CNs) of Pt–Pt and Pt–Ni shells are determined to be 2.6 and 6.4, respectively. The relatively large CN of Pt–Ni in comparison to that of Pt–Pt demonstrates that Pt forms an alloy with Ni in which the Pt–Ni intermetallic coordination is the main component of the Pt local environment. This conclusion is also confirmed by the Ni K edge fitting results (Ni–Pt with a bond length of 2.58 Å and CN of 3.2). Under the reaction conditions, the Pt–Ni shell is still observed with a bond length of 2.57 Å and CN of 8.8. Meanwhile, Ni–Pt is also one of the main components at the Ni K edge spectrum, suggesting that the bimetallic particle is still in the form of Pt–Ni alloy.

3.2.4 DRIFTS
The DRIFT spectra following the adsorption of CO at room temperature are compared for the reduced Pt/CeO2, Ni/CeO2, and PtNi/CeO2 catalysts in the region of 2150–1750 cm–1. As shown in Figure 7, adsorption of CO on Pt/CeO2 produces two main bands at 2066 and 1965 cm–1. The strong, broad band at 2066 cm–1 is assigned to the linear (on top) CO species adsorbed on the terrace or step site of Pt0 atoms. (35) The band at 1965 cm–1 and a weak band at 1882 cm–1 are assigned to bridge-bonded CO species. (36-38) However, the main CO absorption bands on Ni/CeO2 are observed at 1967 and 1880 cm–1, which can be assigned to bridge-bonded CO species. However, the weak band at 2050 cm–1 is attributed to linearly adsorbed CO on Ni. (39)
Figure 7
Figure 7. DRIFT spectra of CO adsorption on reduced PtNi bimetallic catalyst (black line) with respective monometallic catalysts (Pt, blue line; Ni, red line) at room temperature.
A strong band at 2062 cm–1 is observed on the bimetallic PtNi/CeO2 catalyst, which is similar to the vibrational frequency of the Pt/CeO2 catalyst. The absorption band corresponding to CO adsorption on Ni is largely suppressed, and the band due to bridge-bonded CO species is weakened in the bimetallic sample. The comparison of the three spectra indicates that the PtNi bimetallic surface is much richer with Pt atoms, resulting from the formation of the Pt-dominant PtNi bimetallic surface on CeO2. This is consistent with previous DFT studies of stable surface structures of Ni/Pt(111), predicting that a Pt-terminated bimetallic surface is thermodynamically stable after reducing the surface with H2. (40)
3.2.5 Flow Reactor Evaluation
The conversions of CO2 and ethane as a function of time on stream are shown in Figure 8 for bimetallic and monometallic catalysts at 873 K. The steady-state conversions, turnover frequencies (TOF), space−time yields (STY), and CO selectivity are given in Table 2. Two definitions of TOF, one calculated by normalizing conversion with the CO uptake value of the freshly reduced catalyst (Table S1 in the Supporting Information) and the other obtained by normalizing conversion with the loading amount of active metals for each catalyst, are adopted in this work. The activities of PtNi/CeO2, Pt/CeO2, and Ni/CeO2 for DRB are summarized in the same fashion, as shown in Figure 9 and Table 3.

Tables 2 and 3 show that the steady-state conversions of CO2 and ethane/butane on the bimetallic catalyst are higher than the sum of those on the corresponding monometallic catalysts. Furthermore, the TOF values and STYs of products in Table 2 clearly suggest that the PtNi/CeO2 catalyst has much higher activity for the DRE reaction, in comparison to the monometallic catalysts. As shown in Table 3, the PtNi/CeO2 catalyst also presents the highest activity for DRB reaction on the basis of active metal loading amount, though its activity is only slightly higher than that of Ni/CeO2.
As shown in Figure 8, the steady-state ethane conversions on the Pt/CeO2 and Ni/CeO2 monometallic catalysts decrease by about 46% and 38%, respectively, in comparison to their initial values. The corresponding value for the bimetallic catalyst declines by a lower extent, 28%. The same trend is observed in Figure 9, which shows that the decrease in catalytic activity for butane conversion on PtNi/CeO2 (17%) is less than that on Pt/CeO2 (38%) and Ni/CeO2 (35%), illustrating that the PtNi/CeO2 bimetallic catalyst is more stable.
The reaction rates of CO2 and ethane, as well as that of CO2 and butane on PtNi/CeO2, Pt/CeO2, and Ni/CeO2 at different temperatures after 13 h operation are plotted as a function of 1/T in Figures 10 and 11, respectively. It is apparent that the PtNi/CeO2 bimetallic catalyst is more active for both DRE and DRB reactions over a wide range of temperatures. The apparent activation energies on these three supported catalysts for both CO2 and ethane/butane can be estimated from the Arrhenius plot. For the DRE reaction, the apparent activation energy on the bimetallic catalyst is much lower than the two on the monometallic catalysts, indicating that the ethane reforming activity is greatly improved over the bimetallic catalyst. For the DRB reaction, the apparent activation energies on the PtNi/CeO2 and Ni/CeO2 catalysts are almost the same, while the Pt/CeO2 catalyst shows a very low butane reforming activity. In most cases, the activation energy of CO2 is smaller than the corresponding value of ethane/butane. This is due to the fact that the reforming reaction is always accompanied by the reverse water-gas shift (RWGS) reaction, and its activation barrier is much lower than that of the dry reforming reactions (Figures S2 and S3 in the Supporting Information). Previous studies have shown that CO2 activation by H2 occurs readily at 573 K over PtNi/CeO2. (8, 15) In comparison, the dry reforming reactions (activation of CO2 by ethane and butane) require significantly higher temperatures, suggesting that the activation of alkane should be a key step for dry reforming over the PtNi/CeO2 catalyst.

3.3 DFT Calculations
In order to further understand the bimetallic effects, the binding energies of potential reaction intermediates for the C–C bond cleavage in ethane (given in Table 4) are calculated on Pt(111), Ni(111), Pt-terminated-PtNi-Pt(111), and mixed-PtNi-Pt(111) surfaces. Herein, the surface models without the support (CeO2) are used to study the oxidative C–C bond cleavage of ethane, as our previous study showed that such models are adequate to identify the trend in energy profiles for the C–C bond cleavage in ethane. (8) The DFT calculated binding energies in Table 4 show that O-bound surface species, O, CH3CH2O, CH3CHO, and CH3CO (Figure 12), bind more strongly on Ni(111) than on Pt(111). In contrast, C-bound surface species, CH3 (Figure 12), bind more strongly on Pt(111) than on Ni(111). In comparison, on the Pt-terminated-PtNi-Pt(111) surface, the binding strengths of all intermediates are generally weaker than those on both Pt(111) and Ni(111) surfaces. It is also noted that the binding energies of the intermediates on the mixed-PtNi-Pt(111) surface are very close to those on the Ni(111) surface due to the presence of Ni on the surface. Thus, the mixed-PtNi-Pt(111) surface is predicted to show similar activity/selectivity in ethane reforming reactions with the Ni(111) surface.

Binding geometries of all intermediates on Pt(111), Ni(111), and mixed-PtNi-Pt(111) surfaces are similar to those shown here on Pt-terminated-PtNi-Pt(111) surface. Color scheme: light gray, Pt; green, Ni; dark gray, C; red, O; blue, H.
The change in binding energies along with a potential reforming pathway for ethane, via C–C bond cleavage leading to products *CH3, *CO and H2(g), is calculated on Pt(111), Ni(111), Pt-terminated-PtNi-Pt(111) and mixed-PtNi-Pt(111) surfaces in the presence of preadsorbed O atoms. The DFT-calculated energy diagrams show that the C–C bond cleavage (via the pathway in Figure 13) is energetically least favorable on Ni(111) and most favorable on Pt-terminated-PtNi-Pt(111), while Pt(111) lies between Ni(111) and Pt-terminated-PtNi-Pt(111). In contrast, mixed-PtNi-Pt(111) lies very close to Ni(111) in Figure 13. Therefore, the DFT calculations predict that Pt-terminated-PtNi-Pt(111) would show better activity for ethane reforming than Pt(111) and Ni(111). It is noted that the catalytic activity predicted on the basis of DFT-calculated thermodynamics decreases with O binding energy. Surfaces that bind O strongly are less active than the surfaces that bind O weakly for O-assisted ethane reforming (via the pathway shown in Figure 13). Ni(111) binds O most strongly and is predicted to be least active for ethane reforming, while Pt-terminated-PtNi-Pt(111) binds O most weakly and is predicted to be most active among Pt, Ni, Pt-terminated-PtNi-Pt(111), and mixed-PtNi-Pt(111) surfaces.

4 Discussion
Results from both model surfaces and supported catalysts reveal that the PtNi/CeO2 bimetallic catalyst shows higher activity than the corresponding monometallic catalysts. The AP-XPS measurements for butane reforming on the PtNi/CeO2 model surface show that the presence of Pt promotes Ni reduction, suggesting a synergistic interaction between the two metals during the high-temperature reaction. This PtNi/CeO2 model surface then exhibits the highest extent of butane activation and results in the most intense C 1s peak of the adsorbed O–CxHy, indicating that the formation of the PtNi bimetallic surface enhances the activity in activating butane. The model surface results are well supported by DFT calculations of the O binding energy on different surfaces for the reaction of ethane. For O-assisted ethane reforming, the weaker surface O binding strength makes adsorbed O more reactive to form the C–O bond (i.e., O–CxHy species). Therefore, the Pt-terminated-PtNi-Pt(111) surface that binds O most weakly is predicted to be the most active for alkane reforming in comparison to Pt and Ni surfaces.
The presence of Pt can facilitate the reduction of NiO and surface CeO2 species (from Ce4+ to Ce3+) by decreasing the reduction temperature on the supported PtNi/CeO2 bimetallic catalyst, observed in the TPR experiments and in situ XRD characterization. The reduced state of CeO2 shows a strong tendency to react with CO2 and promotes its dissociation, (12, 14) leading to a higher CO2 activation. The formation of the PtNi alloy under reaction conditions was evidenced with the detection of the reflection peak at 8.5° in the in situ XRD measurements, as shown Figure 4. The formation of the PtNi alloy after H2 reduction at 723 K and under reaction conditions at 873 K was further confirmed by in situ XAFS characterizations. The XANES spectra suggested that the valence state and local structure of both Pt and Ni under both conditions were basically the same. Detailed EXAFS fittings of Pt L3 edge and Ni K edge spectra revealed the formation of the PtNi alloy, indicating that Pt–Ni intermetallic coordination was the main component of the Pt local environment, while Ni–Pt was also one of the main components of the Ni local environment. The supported PtNi bimetallic catalyst shows a Pt-like CO binding behavior (DRIFT spectra in Figure 7), suggesting that the PtNi bimetallic alloy has a Pt-rich surface. Pt-terminated-PtNi-Pt(111) and mixed-PtNi-Pt(111) surfaces were therefore employed as different simplified parts of the Pt-rich bimetallic surface. The calculated energy required for C–C bond breakage for the DRE reaction via the pathway shown in Figure 13 follows the trend PtNi/CeO2 < Pt/CeO2 < Ni/CeO2, which is consistent with the trend of ethane reforming activities in term of the steady-state formation rate of CO in the flow reactor tests (73.8, 45.2, and 37.4 mol molmetal–1 min–1 for PtNi/CeO2, Pt/CeO2, and Ni/CeO2, respectively). Furthermore, DFT calculations show that the bimetallic surface binds C most weakly, which potentially reduces the stability of deposited carbon atoms on the surface. This could enhance the resistance to coke formation and is consistent with the experimental observation of a higher steady-state stability of the bimetallic PtNi/CeO2 catalyst (Figures 8 and 9).
As given in Table S1 in the Supporting Information, the CO uptake values of the spent PtNi/CeO2 catalysts after oxygen treatment (to completely remove carbon deposits on the surface) for DRE and DRB are almost the same as those of the freshly reduced catalysts, suggesting that the deactivation of the bimetallic catalyst is mainly caused by coking on the surface rather than sintering of the active metals. The conclusion is further confirmed by both EDX-STEM mappings (Figure S4 in the Supporting Information) and TEM images (Figure S5 in the Supporting Information) of the reduced and spent PtNi/CeO2 catalysts for both DRE and DRB reactions. The EDX element mappings show that the active metals, Pt and Ni, are still well dispersed on the spent sample even though a very small agglomerations of Ni is observed. The average metal particle sizes estimated from the TEM images are 2.3, 2.3, and 2.5 nm for reduced and spent PtNi/CeO2 catalysts for DRE and for DRB, respectively, indicating that the metal particle sintering was almost negligible during the reaction. The CO uptake value of the spent PtNi/CeO2 catalysts for the DRE reaction before oxygen treatment is 13.7 μmol CO gcatalyst–1, suggesting that about 40% of the active sites on the spent catalyst was covered by carbon deposits. The CO uptake value of the spent PtNi/CeO2 catalysts after oxygen treatment is 22.6 μmol CO gcatalyst–1, which is very close to that of the fresh sample, suggesting that the sintering of the active metals is not significant. According to the TPO-TGA results (Figure S6 in the Supporting Information), three types of carbon deposits on the spent PtNi/CeO2 catalyst for the DRE reaction are identified by its distinct peaks (peak 1 at 664 K, peak 2 at 767 K, and peak 3 at 846 K). All of these carbon deposits could be removed in the air flow below the reaction temperature (i.e., 873 K), indicating that the in situ regeneration of the spent PtNi/CeO2 catalyst can be easily achieved.
Although DRB is thermodynamically more favorable than DRE, the catalytic activity evaluation on the PtNi/CeO2 bimetallic catalyst shows an opposite trend. The steady-state formation rates of CO, which represents the activity of the dry reforming reaction, are 73.8 and 69.0 mol molmetal–1 min–1 over PtNi/CeO2 in DRE and DRB, respectively. The apparent activation energy on the bimetallic catalyst at the steady state also follows the reverse trend of DRE (71.6 kJ/mol) < DRB (101.8 kJ/mol), which indicates that DRE is kinetically more favorable than DRB.
5 Conclusions
Dry reforming of ethane and butane has been studied on the PtNi/CeO2 bimetallic catalyst and the corresponding monometallic catalysts using model surfaces and supported catalysts. The results show that the bimetallic catalyst presents an enhanced reforming activity over the monometallic catalysts. Results from DFT calculations and in situ experimental measurements indicate that the enhanced activity of bimetallic catalyst can be attributed to the formation of the Pt–Ni bimetallic bonds. DFT calculations show that the Pt-dominant bimetallic surface would not only weaken the surface O binding strength to improve the activity but also reduce the stability of deposited carbon atom to potentially improve the stability. Results from the current study also demonstrate the importance of combining DFT calculations, in situ characterization, and reactor evaluation for understanding catalytic properties of bimetallic catalysts.
