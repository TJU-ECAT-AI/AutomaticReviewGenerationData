Abstract 
Molecular structures of the unpromoted and K2O-promoted supported WO3/Al2O3 catalysts 
were studied with in situ Raman and UV-vis spectroscopy. In situ Raman spectra revealed that 
supported 20% WO3/Al2O3 corresponds to near monolayer coverage of isolated and oligomeric

surface WOx species on Al2O3. Above monolayer surface WOx coverage (21% WO3/Al2O3), 
crystalline WO3 nanoparticles are also present. The addition of K2O to the supported WO3/Al2O3 
catalyst increased the concentration of isolated surface WOx species and did not form K2WO4 
nanoparticles. The reducibility of the tungsten oxide structures depends on their structures (2D or 
3D) and the K2O promoter. Their interaction with acidic CO2 and SO2 gases was also 
investigated. Adsorption of CO2 creates several surface carbonate species of varying acidity that 
were detected using a combination of in situ IR and mass spectroscopy. Adsorbed bicarbonate 
form on weakly basic surface sites on tungsten oxide monolayer WO3/Al2O3 catalyst as well as 
in the presence of low 2.5% K2O loading. At high 5% K2O loading, the presence of the strong 
surface basic sites yields adsorbed carbonates. After SO2 pretreatment, however, new strongly 
adsorbed sulfate appears on the surface that inhibits CO2 adsorption.

1. Introduction  
Abundant, yet difficult to utilize sour natural gas contains a large number of acidic 
components such as CO2 and H2S at quite high concentrations. Approximately 40 % of the 
world’s conventional natural gas reserves contain significant amounts of H2S and CO2 while 
about 30 % contain <15 % CO2 and 1-15 % H2S [1]. These sour gas concentrations are treatable 
with conventional methods such as amine absorption/desorption [2–4], but the question remains 
whether this can be achieved economically. A major problem of conventional sour gas removal 
from natural gas remains utilization of the large amounts of environmentally non-friendly CO2 
and H2S byproducts. Conventionally, the acidic CO2 is emitted into the atmosphere acting as a 
major greenhouse gas motivating the need for new catalytic methods of converting CO2 into 
hydrocarbons [5–7]. The H2S, however, is a sour gas with high toxicity that is oxidized via the 
Claus process to yield unreactive elemental sulfur that can be used for the manufacture of 
sulfuric acid or deposited in chemical landfills [8]. An alternative is to directly convert H2S and 
carbon oxides with the addition of H2 to form the reactive CH3SH intermediate that can be 
further converted to a mixture of paraffin and olefins to avoid the high conventional CH4-CO2-
H2S separation costs [9–16]. Early studies have revealed the catalytic activity of supported 
tungsten based catalysts for such reaction, as well as the promotional effect of K2O [17–20]. For 
example, Barrault et al. have achieved high selectivity towards two major products of CO (49%) 
and CH3SH (51%) from a mixture of CO2, H2S and H2 by using a supported 10 % K2WO4/-
Al2O3 catalyst [20].  
As a widely used catalyst, supported WO3/Al2O3 is active for a variety of reactions such as 
alkane metathesis [21,22], hydrogenation [23,24], dehydration [25,26], hydro-desulfurization 
[27,28] and hydrocarbon cracking [29,30]. Its molecular structure and surface chemistry have 
been extensively investigated in the literature, showing the existence of isolated, oligomeric and 
crystalized WOx species depending on catalyst loadings [31–33]. Addition of K2O has been 
found to play an important role as a promoter for the supported WO3/Al2O3 catalyst and favors 
the production of methyl mercaptan from methanol and hydrogen sulfide [34]. Much less 
research, however, has been dedicated to elucidating the structure of the K2O-promoted 
supported WOx/Al2O3 catalyst.  
In this work, we aim at elucidating the promotional effect of K2O to WO3/Al2O3 catalyst 
with an emphasis on its modification of surface chemistry, especially the interplay with two

weakly adsorbed reactant molecules including H2 and CO2. In addition, the performance of 
competitive CO2 adsorption under sulfur containing acidic environment was evaluated with the 
aid of SO2 pre-adsorption. The application of modern characterization techniques including 
STEM, in situ Raman, in situ UV-vis, in-situ Diffuse Reflectance Infrared Fourier Transform 
Spectroscopy (DRIFTS), H2 temperature programmed reduction (TPR) and CO2 temperature 
programmed desorption (TPD) has enabled the understanding of the surface chemistry for K2O 
promoted  WOx/Al2O3 catalyst. Those fundamental insights will have the potential to guide the 
rational design of improved tungsten based catalysts for direct methyl mercaptan synthesis from 
sour natural gas. 
 
2. Experimental 
2.1.Catalyst preparation.  
Ternary K2O promoted WO3/Al2O3 catalysts (K2O/WO3/Al2O3) were synthesized with 
incipient-wetness impregnation method using water soluble ammonium metatungstate 
((NH4)6H2W12O40xH2O) and potassium hydroxide (KOH) as precursors [35,36]. The active 
catalyst materials support was Toyota γ-Al2O3 with surface area 170 m2/g. The synthesis 
involved two separate steps. In particular, tungsten oxide was initially impregnated into the γ-
Al2O3 support and followed by impregnation of K2O in the second step. Specific amount of 
ammonium metatungstate ((NH4)6H2W12O40xH2O) was placed into a ceramic crucible, dissolved 
in 1 ml of deionized water and 1 gram of γ-Al2O3 was added into the ceramic crucible and stirred 
for 30 minutes. The samples were dried under ambient conditions overnight, further dried at 120 
°C for 16 hours and finally calcined at 500oC for 4 hours. 
2.2. Scanning Transmission Electron Microscopy 
The morphology of the catalyst particles was investigated using a dedicated Scanning 
Transmission Electron Microscope (STEM) (Hitachi 2700C) operating at 200 kV. 
2.3. In Situ UV-vis Diffuse Reflectance Spectroscopy (DRS)  
In situ UV-vis DR spectra of WO3/Al2O3 and K2O/WO3/Al2O3 catalysts were obtained 
using a Cary 5000 UV-vis NIR spectrometer. The samples were loaded into an in situ cell 
(Harrick, HVC-DR2) and dehydrated under the flow of 10% O2/He at 400°C for 1 hour. A 
magnesium oxide sample was used as the reflectance standard for collecting baseline in the 200-
800 nm region.

2.4. In Situ Raman spectroscopy 
Raman spectra were collected using a LabRam-HR spectrometer (Horiba-Jobin Yvon) 
equipped with a confocal microscope, 2400/900 grooves/mm gratings and a notch filter. The 
532-nm visible laser was focused on the samples using a confocal microscope equipped with a 
50x long working distance objective (Olympus, BX-30- LWD). The scattered photons were 
directed and focused onto a single-stage monochromator and measured with a UV-sensitive LN2-
cooled CCD detector (Horiba, CCD-3000V). Catalyst samples were placed in an 
environmentally controlled high-temperature cell reactor (Harrick). Dehydrated spectra were 
collected after catalysts were dehydrated in the stream of 10 % O2/Ar at 400°C for 1 hour. 
2.5. H2-Temperature Programmed Reduction (TPR) Spectroscopy 
The H2-TPR experiments were carried out using an Altamira Instruments (AMI-200) 
instrument connected to a TCD detector. Approximately 30 mg of catalyst was loaded into a U-
tube sample holder for analysis. The catalysts tested were first dehydrated under 10% O2/Ar at 
400°C for 1 hour then cooled down to 100°C. The H2-TPR experiments were then performed by 
ramping up the temperature under 10% H2/Ar (30 ml/min) at a rate of 10°C/min. 
2.6. CO2-Temperature Programmed Desorption (TPD) Spectroscopy 
The CO2-TPD experiments were performed using an Altamira Instruments system (AMI-
200) with a TCD detector. Approximately 50 mg of catalyst was loaded into a U-tube sample 
holder for analysis. The catalysts tested were first dehydrated under 10% O2/Ar at 400°C for 1 
hour then cooled down to room temperature. The catalysts were then saturated under CO2 flow 
for 1 hour and flushed with He for 30 min. After the He flush, the CO2-TPD experiments were 
performed by ramping the temperature under He at a rate of 10°C/min. 
2.7. 
Surface Chemistry and Acidity 
Catalyst surface acidity was examined using a combination of NH3 probe molecule and 
infrared spectroscopy. A Thermo Nicolet iS50 infrared spectrometer equipped with a Mercury-
Cadmium-Tellurium (MCT) liquid nitrogen cooled detector was used with a Harrick Praying 
Mantis™ diffuse reflection accessory and ZnSe windows for determination of the acid sites. 
Catalysts were initially dehydrated by heating to 400°C (heating rate of 10°C/min) and holding 
at 400°C for 1 h under air flow (30 mL/min). The in situ IR spectra were collected under N2 (30 
ml/min) while cooling down at 400°C, 300°C, 200°C and 120°C. Subsequently, N2 was replaced 
with a flow of 1% NH3/N2 (30 mL/min; 30 min). Physisorbed NH3 was removed by flowing N2

6 
 
(30 mL/min; 30 min). Spectra were then continuously recorded every minute during the 
temperature programming until 400°C under 30 ml/min N2 flow. The spectra of dehydrated 
catalysts at specified temperatures were subtracted from the spectra containing contributions of 
the catalyst and adsorbed NH3 surface species at the same temperature. 
2.8. In Situ Diffuse Reflectance Infrared Fourier Transformed Spectroscopy (DRIFTS) 
DRIFTS experiments were performed using in the diffuse reflectance mode in a Thermo 
Nicolet Nexus 670 spectrometer. Quadrupole mass spectrometer (Omnistar GSD-301 O2, Pfeiffer 
Vacuum) was used to analyze the reaction products from the DRIFTS cell (Pike Technologies 
HC-900). Catalyst samples were first dehydrated under 5%O2/He at 500°C for 1 hour and then 
cooled down to room temperature. After that, 30 ml/min CO2 (2% CO2/N2) was introduced for 
30 min, followed by a 20-min flush with He. The samples were then heated up to 500°C under 
He with a rate of 10°C/min. The catalysts then were cooled down to room temperature again, 
pre-treated with 30 ml/min SO2 (210 ppm) for 30 min and flushed with He for 20 min. The 
pretreated samples were further saturated with CO2 by flowing 30 ml/min 2% CO2/N2 for 30 min 
and flushed with He for 20 min and subsequently heated up under flowing He to 500°C with a 
rate of 10°C/min. 
 
3. Results and discussion 
3.1. Surface structure 
The detailed composition, K/W atomic ratio and BET surface areas of all prepared catalysts 
were shown in Table 1. The Eg values were also calculated and provided from the corresponding 
in-situ UV-vis spectra under dehydrated conditions (Figure 1). Those values are within the range 
of oligomers of WO6 (2.8 eV) and isolated WO4 units (5.2 eV), indicating the coexistence of 
isolated and oligomeric species [37]. The smaller Eg value for 20% WO3/Al2O3 than 21% 
WO3/Al2O3 reflects the presence of a greater amount of oligomeric tungsten oxide component in 
the latter catalyst. Adding small amount of potassium oxide (K/W=0.65) has negligible effect on 
UV-vis Eg value as well as the relative populations of isolated and oligomeric surface WOx 
species. The addition of more potassium oxide (K/W=1.26), however, increases the UV-vis Eg 
value to 4.9 eV, reflecting an increase in the population of isolated surface WOx species at the 
expense of the oligomeric surface WOx species.

Catalyst surface information and the interaction between K and W species were further 
studied with in situ Raman spectra. Crystalline WO3 exhibits strong and sharp Raman bands at 
273, 719 and 809 cm-1, while crystalline K2WO4 possesses strong and sharp Raman bands at 324 
and 927 cm-1, reflecting the presence of oligomeric WO6 and isolated WO4 sites in the WO3 and 
K2WO4 crystals, respectively [37]. The Raman spectrum of supported 20% WO3/Al2O3 
exclusively exhibits a band at 1021 cm-1 and is assigned to surface WOx species on the Al2O3 
support, which is also confirmed by STEM image (Figure 2b, Figure S1). The Raman band at 
1021 cm-1 corresponds to the stretching mode of isolated and oligomeric mono-oxo O=WO4/5 
surface species [32]. Supported 21% WO3/Al2O3 catalyst contains the surface O=WO4/5 species 
(1021 cm-1) and crystalline WO3 nanoparticles (NPs) with strong characteristic bands at 260,

327, 711 and 804 cm-1. The much stronger intensity for crystalline nanoparticles is due to the 
higher Raman cross sections. The Raman spectra for the K-promoted 2.5% K2O/19.5% 
WO3/Al2O3 and 5% K2O/19% WO3/Al2O3 catalysts exhibit the W=O bands at 985 cm-1 and 963 
cm-1 with the absence of crystalline K2WO4 bands [38]. The shift of the W=O Raman band from 
1021 to 963-985 cm-1 indicates that the potassium is interacting with the surface WOx species 
and reflects lengthening of the W=O bond [33].

3.2. H2-TPR 
The interaction of the supported 20% WO3/Al2O3, 21% WO3/Al2O3, 2.5% K2O/19.5% 
WO3/Al2O3 and 5% K2O/19% WO3/Al2O3 catalysts with H2 molecules was assessed with H2-
TPR and the results are shown in Figure 3. All four catalysts exhibited reduction peak at a 
temperature higher than 600°C, corresponding to the reduction of surface tungsten oxide species. 
Such a high reduction temperature has also been previously confirmed both theoretically and 
experimentally [39,40]. The supported 21% WO3/Al2O3 catalyst possesses an extra reduction 
peak at 578°C that is assigned to the reduction of crystalline WO3 NPs [41,42]. Addition of K2O 
ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT
9 
 
to the catalyst shifted the reduction peak of surface tungsten species to lower temperature 
(Tp~725°C) and is probably due to enhanced H2 adsorption or dissociation on K atoms.

3.3. CO2-TPD 
The desorption of CO2, SO2 and H2O from dehydrated catalysts, with and without SO2 
pretreatment, during temperature programming are shown in Figure 4 (a-d). In the absence of 
SO2 pretreatment, the supported 20% WO3/Al2O3 and 21% WO3/Al2O3 catalysts exhibit poor 
CO2 adsorption capacity with barely a trace of CO2 desorption at ~50 °C (see Figure 4 (a and d)) 
because acidic CO2 very weakly interacts with the acidic surface WOx sites [43]. The absence of 
CO2 adsorption capacity of these two supported WO3/Al2O3 catalysts reflects the presence of a 
surface WOx monolayer that covers the basic sites of the alumina support. The addition of 
potassium oxide enhances CO2 adsorption as reflected by CO2 desorption at ~50 °C because of 
the interaction of acidic CO2 with basic surface K2O sites. The CO2 adsorption capacity of the 
dehydrated catalysts follows the order 5% K2O/19% WO3/Al2O3 > 2.5% K2O/19.5% WO3/Al2O3 
> 20% WO3/Al2O3 > 21% WO3/Al2O3.  
The adsorption capacity of SO2 on the catalysts is shown in Figure 4 and is significantly 
greater than that of CO2 because of the stronger acidity of SO2 compared to CO2. Unlike the very 
ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT
10 
 
weak CO2 adsorption on the K-free supported WO3/Al2O3 catalysts, SO2 modestly adsorbs on the 
K-free supported WO3/Al2O3 catalysts. The adsorption capacity of SO2 greatly increases, by ~5x, 
with K2O content because of the increased number of surface basic sites introduced by potassium 
oxide.  
Although there is no H2O desorption for the catalysts not pretreated with SO2, as expected 
for the dehydrated catalysts, all the supported WO3/Al2O3 catalysts exhibit H2O desorption after 
SO2 pretreatment (Figure S2). The amount of H2O desorbed appears to decrease with potassium 
oxide promotion. The formation of H2O after SO2 treatment suggests that SO2 is either reacting 
with alumina surface hydroxyls or making the catalyst hygroscopic and retains the trace moisture 
in the environmental cell. 
The weak CO2 adsorption capability was further decreased from the catalysts, especially the 
K-promoted catalysts, when SO2 was pre-adsorbed on the catalysts. The supported 2.5% 
K2O/19.5% WO3/Al2O3 catalyst exhibited negligible CO2 desorption indicating that that acidic 
SO2 coordinated to the basic surface K2O sites and blocked coordinating of acidic CO2. The 
supported 5% K2O/19% WO3/Al2O3 catalyst however, still possesses CO2 adsorption capacity 
after SO2 pretreatment reflecting the presence of residual basic surface sites (~50%,). The SO2 
pretreatment also appears to slightly weaken the CO2 binding to the catalyst with Tp decreasing 
from ~75 to ~60 oC when the supported 5% K2O/19% WO3/Al2O3 catalyst was exposed to SO2.

3.4. Surface acidity probed with NH3 adsorption 
The surface acidity of the dehydrated supported WOx catalysts was probed with NH3-
DRIFTS and the temperature dependent spectrum are presented in Figure 5. After NH3 
adsorption at 120°C, the 20% WO3/Al2O3 catalyst (Figure 5(a)) exhibits IR bands for both 
adsorbed NH3 species (1615 and 1279 cm-1) and NH4+ species (1674 and 1432 cm-1) [44,45]. The 
existence of two type of adsorbed ammonia species clearly demonstrates that surface of the 20% 
WO3/Al2O3 catalyst possesses both Lewis (NH3) and Brønsted (NH4+) acidity. Upon increasing 
the temperature, the population of the adsorbed NH3 species decrease slower than surface NH4+ 
species that shows their greater stability on the surface. The NH3-IR spectrum for the supported 
5% K2O/19% WO3/Al2O3 catalyst is shown in Figure 5(b) and the addition of potassium greatly 
ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT
12 
 
modifies the surface acidity of supported WOx catalyst. The lack of the predominant 1279 cm-1 
band for adsorbed NH3 species and the 1432 cm-1 band for adsorbed NH4+ species suggest that 
K2O completely suppressed both Brønsted and Lewis acidity from the surface WOx species or 
exposed Al2O3 sites. The weak IR band at 1646 cm-1, which diminishes at higher temperature, 
may arise from adsorbed ammonia species on K sites. Similarly, a sole band at 1610 cm-1 was 
observed for very low NH3 coverages on Fe{111} pre-covered with 0.25 monolayer of K and 
was attributed to antisymmetric deformation mode of ammonia, a [46]. This vibration was 
attributed specifically to the interaction between ammonia and potassium atoms.

3.5. In-situ DRIFTS using CO2 and SO2 as acidic probe molecules 
Carbonate in its free ion form has a Raman active vibration of 1063 cm-1 due to the 
symmetric C-O stretching (υ1), an IR active vibration of 879 cm-1 due to out-of-plane 
deformation (υ2), and two Raman-IR active vibrations of 1415 and 680 cm-1, due to CO 
asymmetric stretching (υ3) and in-plane deformation (υ4), respectively [47,48]. Changes in 
molecular symmetry from electrostatic, hydrogen and covalent binding induce important shifts as 
well as the doubly degenerate υ3 and υ4 split. The magnitude of this υ3 shift is attributed to 
different binding modes of the carbonate species formed. The surface species and their thermal 
stability on supported γ-Al2O3 after CO2 adsorption has previously been well investigated in the 
literature [35,47]. Four types of surface chemisorbed carbonate species were identified: a) 
monodentate, 2) bidentate (1730-1660 and 1270-1230 cm-1), 3) bridged surface carbonate 
ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT
13 
 
(~1900-1750 cm-1 and 1180 cm-1) and 4) bicarbonate (~3610-3605, 1650-1639, 1490-1440 and 
1236-1225 cm-1). The temperature-dependent in situ IR spectra of γ-Al2O3 obtained after CO2 
adsorption are presented in Figure 6. Adsorption of CO2 on γ-Al2O3 exhibits three peaks (1659, 
1441 and 1229 cm-1) that are attributed to surface bicarbonate species [47]. These are weakly 
bound to the alumina surface and completely desorb at 250°C.  
 
 
Figure 6. IR spectra of γ-Al2O3 obtained at different temperature after CO2 adsorption. 
 
The temperature programmed-IR spectra of CO2 adsorption products 20 and 21% WO3/Al2O3 
catalysts are shown in Figure 7a and b, respectively. The 21% WO3/Al2O3 catalyst (Figure 7a) 
possesses a characteristic band at 1641 shifts to 1622 cm-1, with increasing temperature and starts 
to desorb at 255 °C. The band position and desorbing temperatures (Td) indicate the presence of 
bicarbonate species. Alternatively, this shift with temperature can be associated with 
transformation of adsorbed bicarbonate into more stable bidentate-II carbonate species. This is 
consistent with the release of gaseous H2O observed in Figure 4 where reactive surface hydroxyl 
recombine and desorb while adsorbed carbonate species are formed. The supported 20% 
WO3/Al2O3 catalyst (figure 7b) contains an IR band at 1678 that shifts to 1630 cm-1 at 225°C. 
That band further transforms into a distinct high temperature-stable carbonate species at 325°C. 
According to Figures 2b and 3, both the supported 20 and 21% WO3/Al2O3 catalysts possess a 
ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT
14 
 
distinct WOx surface structure. It can be suggested that when WO3 nanoparticles are absent on 
the surface WOx monolayer the adsorbed CO2 forms an adsorbed carbonate species at 1581 cm-1. 
Strong CO2 interactions with WO3 nanoparticles, however, are not observed. A detailed literature 
review based on well-defined organometallic CO2-containing molecular infrared vibrations 
revealed that formate species can form with recorded vibration at 1612 cm-1 [47,49]. Other 
adsorbed CO2 species on the W binding centers, such as 2-2, with asymmetric C-O stretch at 
1541 cm-1 or 2-3 Class I at 1321 cm-1 are less likely since they are not stable at elevated 
temperatures [50,51]. 
The intensities of adsorbed CO2 species increase for K2O promoted catalysts, which is 
consistent with the CO2-TPD findings. For the supported 5% K2O/19% WO3/Al2O3 catalyst, 
three IR bands are observed at 1684, 1659 and 1344 cm-1 (Figure 7c). The IR band at 1684 cm-1 
represents bidentate-I species that desorbed at 150°C. The IR band at 1659 cm-1 represented 
bicarbonate species that desorbed at ~125°C. The IR band at 1344 cm-1 disappears much faster 
than the higher wavenumber peaks and can be associated with monodentate species that 
desorbed at ~50 °C. The 2.5% K2O/19.5% WO3/Al2O3 catalyst only exhibit a characteristic IR 
band at 1639 cm-1 (Figure 7d) that starts to desorb at ~125°C and is assigned to bicarbonate 
species.

The CO2 temperature-programmed IR spectroscopy of the catalysts after the SO2 
pretreatment are presented in Figure 8. Interestingly, the supported 20 and 21% WO3/Al2O3 
catalysts contain adsorbed species analogous to those shown in Figure 7 after CO2 adsorption 
with no obvious SO2 species observed. This is due to the weak interactions between the SO2 and 
WO3/Al2O3 and different molar extinction coefficient for CO2,ads and SO2,ads. On the -Al2O3 
support, many surface species form depending on the termination of -Al2O3 and its degree of 
dehydration. In general, they range from weakly bound SO2 coordinated to surface Al-OH, AlO 
or Al sites with vibrations at 1334, 1322, 1255-1189 cm-1, respectively, while adsorbed sulfite, 
AlOSO2, exhibits a band at 1135 cm-1 [52,53]. The absence of these bands in Figure 8a and b 
suggests limited availability of adsorption sites due to the near monolayer surface WOx coverage.

For the supported 5% K2O/19% WO3/Al2O3 catalyst, the IR bands at 1740 and 1670 cm-1 
represent the bridged carbonate species, and the bands at 1639 cm-1 are assigned to bidentate-I 
species which desorb at 150 °C. The band at 1394 cm-1 is assigned to the formation of aluminum 
sulfate, Al2(SO4)3 and the band at 1313 cm-1 is assigned to the physisorbed SO2 species 
[40,52,53]. The supported 2.5% K2O/19.5% WO3/Al2O3 catalyst exhibits an IR band at 1637 cm-
1 (Td=255°C) that is attributed to bidentate-II species. The IR band at 1390 cm-1 is attributed to 
the formation of aluminum sulfate, Al2(SO4)3 [54]. The characteristic peak at 1371 cm-1 
represented the asymmetric stretching of the SO2 vibration and the band at 1325 cm-1 is 
attributed to physisorbed SO2 species [47,54,55].  The peak assignment of DRIFT spectra 
obtained under two different conditions are summarized in Table 2.

Figure 9 Pictorial representation of the acid gas, CO2 and SO2, interactions with WO3/Al2O3 and 
K2O/19.5% WO3/Al2O3 catalyst surfaces. 
 
Surface WOx species dominate un-promoted and K2O-promoted supported WO3/Al2O3 
catalysts. For dehydrated supported WO3/Al2O3 catalysts with high tungsten oxide coverage, the 
surface WOx sites contain both isolated and oligomeric sites. With increasing potassium oxide 
loading, the surface WOx sites become more isolated. The isolated surface WOx sites on Al2O3 
are difficult to reduce while K2O promotion improves reduction of surface WOx sites at elevated 
temperatures. For the monolayer covered supported WO3/Al2O3 catalysts, CO2 adsorption results 
in weakly bound surface bicarbonate species and addition of K2O changed both the surface 
carbonate speciation and the CO2 adsorption capacity. The adsorption of CO2 on the supported 
WO3/Al2O3 catalyst mostly results in surface bidentate species. On the K2O-promoted supported 
WO3/Al2O3 catalyst, surface bidentate and monodentate species are mainly formed. After SO2 
pretreatment, the new sulfate stretching modes are observed over K2O-promoted catalyst, but 
carbonate stretching vibrations also exist showing a competitive adsorption. With SO2 
pretreatment, the capacity of CO2 adsorption was suppressed while supported 5%K2O/19% 
WO3/Al2O3 catalyst showed the best resistance. As a result, the promotion of K2O for direct 
synthesis of methyl mercaptan from sour gas can be attributed to 1) enhanced H2 adsorption 
and/or dissociation, 2) increased CO2 adsorption and 3) improved resistance to strong acidic 
condition for CO2 adsorption.
