Abstract
Waste nitrous oxide was used as an oxidant for ethane oxydehydrogenation performed at the range of temperature from 350 to 450 8C over iron
modiﬁed zeolite catalysts. Different zeolite matrices (zeolite ZSM-5 of different Si/Al ratio, H-Y, mordenite) modiﬁed with iron cations introduced
into zeolite by means of ionic exchange were applied as catalysts for the reaction under study. Additionally, amorphous silica and alumina silica as
well as silicalite of MFI structure were also used as a matrix for iron ions accommodation and they were tested for oxydehydrogenation reaction. It
was found that only iron modiﬁed zeolites showed activity for reaction under study. Amorphous oxide supports and crystalline neutral silicalite
modiﬁed with iron cations by means of impregnation were completely inactive for oxydehydrogenation reaction. The best catalytic performance
was found on iron modiﬁed zeolites of MFI structure. The Si/Al ratio of the ZSM-5 matrix inﬂuenced the activity for ethane oxydehydrogenation
reaction insigniﬁcantly. N2O oxidant was partly utilized for ethane oxidation (towards ethene or carbon oxides), while some part of the oxidant was
decomposed to nitrogen and oxygen. Performing the reaction at 450 8C resulted in a high ethene yield and complete N2O removal.

1. Introduction
Nitrous oxide, a waste by-product generated in many
industrial processes such as adipic acid and nitric acid
production, has been shown to be an excellent oxidant for
performing some difﬁcult oxidation processes. Direct benzene
to phenol oxidation (BTOP) with N2O as an oxidant has been
recently commercialised by SOLUTIA and it seems to be one
of the cleanest and most elegant methods for phenol production
[1]. The success in the development of a new method for phenol
production involving N2O utilization opened a new perspective
for the other complex oxidation processes. The generation of a-
oxygen, which was believed to insert itself into a C–H bond and
to form hydroxy group connected to hydrocarbons [2] seemed
very promising for light parafﬁns hydroxylation. Considering
the speciﬁc features of a-oxygen one could expect an alcohol
formation as a result of light parafﬁns oxidation in the presence
of iron modiﬁed ZSM-5 zeolite using N2O as an oxidant. The
contact of methane and N2O with iron modiﬁed zeolite ZSM-5
at ambient temperature resulted in the appearance of methanol
adsorbed on the catalyst, which was observed by IR spectra.
However, the oxidation product was not desorbed and at higher
temperature it was oxidised to CO2. As in the case of methane,
oxidation of ethane in the presence of N2O did not result in
oxygen bearing products. On the other hand, it has been shown
that in the presence of N2O as an oxidant, light parafﬁns were
transformed mainly to oleﬁns if iron modiﬁed zeolite ZSM-5
was used as a catalyst [3,4]. The oxydehydrogenation of light
parafﬁns, therefore, seems attractive as a potential source of
oleﬁns, which are essential reagents for many industrial
processes and the use of waste N2O as an oxidant for light
parafﬁns to oleﬁns transformation reveals a new perspective for
light parafﬁns utilization.
In the presented study, nitrous oxide was used as an oxidant
for the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane in the presence of
iron modiﬁed zeolites. Our earlier experience with propane
oxydehydrogenation [4] allowed us to expect an essential
activity of iron modiﬁed zeolites ZSM-5 for oxidative
dehydrogenation of alkanes. Considering that the O species,
which was found to be involved in the oxydehydrogenation
reaction [5,6] could be formed as a result of N2O decomposition
on different transition oxide species, the iron oxides supported
on different zeolite structures and on non-zeolite supports were
also applied as catalysts for the reaction under study.

2. Experimental
Commercial zeolites ZSM-5, faujasite Y and mordenite
were used as a matrix for iron(III) ions accommodation. Iron
ions were introduced into zeolites by means of ionic
exchange from aqueous solution. ZSM-5 zeolites were
commercial products from Su
¨d Chemie (the samples with Si/
Al ratio equal to 25, 50 and 100). Amorphous silica and
alumina silica as well as silicalite were modiﬁed with iron
species by means of impregnation with aqueous solution of
iron(III) nitrate. For comparison additional samples of
zeolite ZSM-5 (Si/Al = 25), faujasite Y and mordenite were
also modiﬁed with iron species by means of impregnation.
All the iron modiﬁed samples were calcined at 600 8C
for 2 h. Fe-ZSM-5 zeolites were also calcined at 900 8C for
2 h.
The activity for ethane oxidative dehydrogenation was
measured in a continuous ﬂow reactor at a temperature of
400 8C usually for 4 h, using N2O as an oxidant. For some
experiments oxygen was used instead of N2O. The catalytic
test was performed at atmospheric pressure, WHSV =
4500 ml/h/gcat and contact time of 0.8 s. Prior to the
experiments the catalysts were pretreated in ﬂowing helium
at 450 8C. Substrates: ethane and N2O were diluted with
helium. Experiments were performed for the molar ratio of
ethane:nitrous oxide:helium equal to 1:1.5:12.5. If oxygen was
used as an oxidant the reagents’ ratio was as follows:
ethane:oxygen:helium was equal to 1:0.6:13.4. Products were
analyzed
using
on-line
GC
equipped
with
a
thermal
conductivity detector.
In order to estimate the acidity of the applied catalysts,
measurements of the temperature-programmed desorption of
ammonia were carried out. Before the experiment the
sample was pretreated in helium at 550 8C for 2 h to
remove adsorbed water. Ammonia was adsorbed on the
samples at 100 8C using an AMI-100 apparatus made by the
Altamira
company.
After
the
catalyst
surface
became
saturated the sample was kept at 50 8C for 2 h to remove
the base excess. Desorption of ammonia was performed
by
ramping
the
temperature
at
10 8C/min
to
900 8C.
The amount of NH3 desorbed was measured by a TCD
detector.
The model reaction of cumene cracking was also used for
estimation of the acidity of the iron modiﬁed zeolites. The
catalytic test was performed at 350 8C in a pulse microreactor
connected to GC.
The interaction of reagents with the catalyst surface was
examined by means of FT-IR spectra. Ethane and N2O were
contacted with a catalyst wafer placed in a vacuum cell and
evacuated previously at 300 8C. FT-IR spectra were recorded
after contact with reagents in the range of temperature from RT
to 300 8C.
The structure of iron modiﬁed zeolites calcined at 600 and
900 8C was characterised by XRD patterns recorded with a
Brucker diffractometer using Cu Ka radiation.
Reﬂectance UV–vis spectra were recorded using Carry 100,
Varian spectrometer.
3. Results and discussion
Extraframework iron species accommodated in high silica
zeolites of MFI structure may be localized in different centers
and, depending on their localization and concentration, they
can form various complexes. Wichterlova
´ et al. [7] deﬁned the
possible localization of extraframework cobalt(II) ions and they
suggested that iron(III) may be localized in the very the same
position. Iron modiﬁed zeolites ZSM-5 showed high activity for
NOx
decomposition.
Iron
complexes
accommodated
in
molecular sieves matrix have been reported in many papers
as active catalysts for N2O decomposition. The decomposition
of N2O over active catalytic centers resulted in the formation of
different oxygen species (O, Oa, O2) characterised with
different thermal stability and different reactivity [8,9]. Some
of these species can be utilized for hydrocarbons oxidation.
Panov et al. [10] have found that mononuclear iron complexes
containing Fe(II) ions may be responsible for a-oxygen
formation and, as a consequence, for benzene to phenol
hydroxylation. On the other hand Pe
´rez-Ramirez and Gallardo-
Llamas [11] and also Sachtler et al. [12] reported that
multinuclear iron clusters were required for the decomposition
of N2O leading to oxygen and nitrogen formation.
N2O decomposition occurs according to Eqs. (1)–(3) [3] and
O* removal from the active site of the catalyst surface is a rate
determining step of N2O decomposition. O* removal may occur
by means of a reaction with the next N2O molecule (Eq. (2)) or
by recombination and formation of O2 molecules (Eq. (3)). O*
species can also react with hydrocarbons forming oleﬁns and
water molecules according to Eq. (4).

Taking into consideration that the ﬁrst reaction step both for
N2O decomposition and for hydrocarbon ODH requires N2O
activation with the subsequent formation of active oxygen
species O* one could expect that iron complexes of similar
structure should be responsible both for N2O decomposition
and ODH reaction, as consistent with the suggestion of
Kondratenko and Pe
´rez-Ramirez [3]. However, one has to
consider that active oxygen species formed over different iron
complexes may indicate different susceptibilities for interac-
tion with subsequent reagents (according to Eqs. (2)–(4)).
Regarding the above, both the number of iron species and their
structure (isolated or oligomeric complexes) should inﬂuence
the catalyst activity.
The number of iron ions introduced into the zeolites ZSM-5
matrix was affected by the Si/Al ratio and it was found to be
equal to 1.4, 0.4 and 0.09 wt.% of Fe for Si/Al ratio 25, 50 and
100, respectively (Table 1). The activities for N2O decom-
position and ethane ODH reaction recorded in our measure-
ments changed parallel to the iron species concentration

202
(Fig. 1). However, N2O decomposition occurred with distinctly
higher conversion than ethane ODH reaction. This difference
should be understandable on the grounds of analysis of
Eqs. (1)–(4) and also on the basis of the results published
recently by Reitzmann and Ates [9]. The decomposition of N2O
led to the formation of different oxygen species. Some of them
may recombine (Eq. (3)) or react with a subsequent N2O
molecule (Eq. (2)) forming O2 molecules almost inactive for
ODH reaction performed in the presence of iron modiﬁed
zeolites. Only a portion of active oxygen species is enable to
react with ethane according to Eq. (4). Therefore, the activity
for ethane ODH reaction should be lower than the activity for
N2O decomposition.
The net charge of zeolite structure, and, the consequent
appearance of cationic centres in the zeolites matrix results
from the presence of aluminium atoms in silica–alumina crystal
structure. The Si/Al ratio inﬂuences both the number of iron
ions introduced by the exchange procedure into the cationic
position as well as the environment of iron species and the
samples acidity [13]. All of these parameters may affect the
oxidative activity of the samples, therefore, one could expect at
least an indirect effect of the Si/Al ratio on the activity for
oxydehydrogenation reaction.
The important role of cationic centres in the mechanism of
the formation of a-iron complexes active for the BTOP process
has been stressed by Panov et al. [14] and by other authors [15].
The presented study has also shown that the presence of
exchangeable cationic centres in the matrix accommodating
iron complexes has a crucial role in the formation of iron
species active for ODH reaction. Only iron species accom-
modated in zeolite channels (ZSM-5, mordenite) or cages
(faujasite) (Fig. 2) showed activity for the oxydehydrogenation
of ethane in the presence of N2O as an oxidant. The oxidative
activity of iron complexes accommodated in the zeolite matrix
of various structures differed noticeably and it increased in the
following sequence Fe-Y < Fe-Mor < Fe-ZSM-5 (Fig. 3). Iron
modiﬁed ZSM-5 showed high selectivity towards ethene (in the
range from 55% to 87%), while Fe-mordenite and Fe-Y
catalysed mainly the total oxidation process. These results
indicated that the zeolite structure played an important role in
the formation of iron complexes active for oxydehydrogenation
reaction. The question arises whether the correct zeolite
structure used for accommodation of iron species is the only
condition for the preparation of an active catalyst for ODH
reaction. To answer this question, the silicalite of correct MFI
structure was modiﬁed with iron ions introduced by means of
impregnation. Taking into consideration that the iron species
were introduced into silicalite by means of impregnation (as it
was into silica and alumina–silica), while the zeolites matrices
were modiﬁed by ionic exchange, additional experiments with
zeolites impregnated with the same amount of iron ions
(1.4 wt.% of iron) were performed. All impregnated samples
were calcined at the same temperature (600 8C). The catalytic
tests showed that iron impregnated zeolites indicated activities

comparable to the one noted for iron exchanged samples, while
Fe-silicalite and Fe-silica and Fe-alumina–silica showed no
activity for ODH reaction (Fig. 4). Considering the above, one
can conclude that both zeolite structure and the presence of
cationic centres located inside zeolite channels or cages are
indispensable for the formation of iron species active for ODH
reaction. In numerous papers [13,14,16] the cationic sites were
indicated as parameters affecting the formation of various
active iron species.
The Si/Al ratio also affects zeolite acidity. It is commonly
accepted that the number and strength of acidic centres affects
both the activity and selectivity of oxidation reactions. The
acidity of the samples under study was estimated on the
grounds of activity for the cumene cracking reaction and it was
further measured by TPD of ammonia. The acidity estimated
from the activity for cumene cracking was very near to that of
the samples with an Si/Al ratio 25 and 50 (cumene conversion
98%, 91% and 49%, 47% for the samples calcined at 600 and
900 8C, respectively) while it was distinctively lower for the
sample with an Si/Al ratio equal to 100 (Fig. 5).
All TPD proﬁles recorded for Fe-ZSM-5 zeolites showed
two peaks of ammonia desorption. Low temperature (LT)
desorption (200 8C) was commonly ascribed to weak acidic
centres or to the physisorption of ammonia. High temperature
desorption (HT) was due to the presence of acidic zeolite
centres (Brønsted or Lewis ones) [17]. The TPD proﬁles
recorded for Fe-ZSM-5 calcined at 600 8C showed two peaks
both in the low and high temperature range. The LT proﬁle of
ammonia desorption recorded for Fe-ZSM-5 zeolites calcined
at 900 8C showed a much lower intensity and the HT peak was
only slightly measurable (Fig. 6). Calculation of zeolites acidity
carried out on the basis of TPD measurements showed very low
disparity in acidity of the samples with an Si/Al ratio equal to
25 and 50 and much lower number of acidic centres on Fe-
ZSM-5-100 (Table 2). TPD proﬁles of ammonia recorded for
the samples calcined at 900 8C indicated much lower acidity
when compared to the samples calcined at 600 8C. Taking into
consideration a distinctive difference in the acidity of the
samples calcined at 600 and 900 8C one could expect some
disparity in ethane conversion and selectivity towards ethene
resulting from different adsorption of reagents and products.
The effect of calcination temperature (600 and 900 8C) for
samples with different Si/Al ratio on ethane conversion and
selectivity towards ethene is presented in Fig. 7. The iron
modiﬁed zeolites of MFI structure with the same iron
concentration calcined at 900 and 600 8C showed a comparable
ethane conversion, while selectivity towards ethene showed
slightly higher values for the samples calcined at 900 8C
(Fig. 7). This indicates that the presence of strong acidic centres
inﬂuences insigniﬁcantly the activity of Fe-ZSM-5 catalyst for
ethane ODH reaction.
Despite the signiﬁcantly various iron capacity in ZSM-5
zeolites of an Si/Al ratio 25 and 50 (1.4 and 0.4 wt.% of iron,
respectively) the ethane conversion over the samples was very
similar. The oxidation process over Fe-ZSM-5-100 containing
0.09 wt.% of iron as well as on H-ZSM-5 with only impurities
of iron (0.06 wt.%) originating from the synthesis process,
occurred with lower conversion. Calculation of TOF (turnover
frequency) for ODH reaction on the studied samples results in

the conclusion that very low contents of iron (0.06 wt.%) led to
the best utilization of iron species, bringing about the highest
value of TOF (Fig. 8). This conclusion is in agreement with
results reported by Pe
´rez-Ramirez and Gallardo-Llamas [11]
who have found that the iron impurities play a decisive role in
the propane oxydehydrogenation reaction. High TOF for the
samples with very low iron contents suggests that isolated iron
species play an important role for the reaction under study.
They are also regarded as being active centres for benzene
hydroxylation performed on iron modiﬁed ZSM-5 zeolites in
the presence of N2O as an oxidant [14]. On the other hand, as
we have shown in this paper, iron species active for ethane ODH
reaction may be formed not only in the channels of Fe-ZSM-5
zeolites

also
in
other
zeolite
structures

mordenite), while benzene to phenol hydroxylation in the
presence of N2O occurs only over iron species accommodated
in the MFI structure and no activity was found over Fe-Y and
Fe-mordenite [16]. N2O decomposition over a-iron complexes,
indispensable for benzene hydroxylation, results in the
formation of a-oxygen [14], which may be inserted into the
C–H bond forming OH group. The ODH reaction requires the
formation of O species, which are able to combine hydrogen
with water formation. Therefore, it seems, that although
isolated iron species are important both for ODH and for BTOP,
the structure of the iron complexes should be different.
According to Panov et al. [14] and also to our earlier report
[15,18] high thermal treatment (700–900 8C) is very important
for the formation of a-iron complexes, which are indispensable
for benzene to phenol hydroxylation. Lower temperature
calcinations resulted in very poor activity for BTOP [15,18].
The iron modiﬁed zeolites of MFI structure, applied for ethane
oxydehydrogenation and previously calcined at 600 and 900 8C
showed comparable ethane conversion and more or less similar
selectivity towards ethene (Fig. 7). This indicates that milder
conditions are sufﬁcient for the formation of iron complexes
indispensable for ODH reaction.
The environment of iron species generated in zeolite matrix
may be, to some extent, characterised by UV–vis reﬂectance
spectra. UV–vis spectra were recorded for unmodiﬁed, as well
as for iron modiﬁed samples calcined at 600 and 900 8C
(Fig. 9A and B). The bands recorded at about 215 and 260 nm
are due to the presence of iron species and they are almost
invisible in the spectrum of an unmodiﬁed sample. According
to Pe
´rez-Ramirez [19] the bands in the region of 200–300 nm
should be ascribed to charge transfer interaction of isolated
iron(III) ions in tetrahedral or octahedral coordination. Iron
ions in octahedral coordination distributed in an alumina
(corundum) matrix showed charge transfer spectra in the range
of 200–300 nm [20]. Taking into consideration that iron ions
were introduced into samples under study by means of ionic
exchange, the recorded bands should be ascribed to the isolated
extra framework iron species in octahedral coordination.
Additional bands at about 350 and 440 nm characterising the
oligomeric iron species and iron oxides particles, respectively,
were also visible. According to Ref. [12] oligomeric iron
species are responsible for high activity of N2O decomposition.
The activity of the samples under study for N2O decomposition
increased with iron concentration (Fig. 1). Simultaneously, with
the growth of iron concentration, the intensity of UV–vis bands
recorded at 350 and 440 nm also increased (Fig. 9B).
Ethane oxidation over iron modiﬁed zeolites of MFI structure
resulted in ethene formation with selectivity in the range from
55% to 87% (Fig. 7). Besides ethene, the outlet gas combined
COx, products of total oxidation. However, contrary to propane
oxidationcarriedoutundersimilar conditions(N2O asan oxidant
and Fe-ZSM-5 as catalyst), which resulted in oxygen bearing
products formed with selectivity up to 30% [4], ethane oxidation
did not provide any oxygenates in the range of applied
temperatures (350–450 8C). Heracleus et al. [21] have observed
similar differences in ethane and propane ODH on vanadia and
molybdena supported catalysts using oxygen as an oxidant. They
discussed the difference considering the disparity in reactivity of
propane and ethane and also the different stability of respective
ODH products. The C–H bond in ethane (420 kJ/mol) is clearly
stronger than the C–H bond in propane (two C–H bonds in
propane show energy equal to 401 kJ/mol). Additionally, ethene
formed as a product of the ODH reaction shows a higher stability
than propene. The C–H vinylic bond in ethene shows energy at
445 kJ/mol, while the allylic bond in propene only 361 kJ/mol.
This disparity in energy bonds may be responsible for the
absence of oxygenates among the ethane oxidation products.
Taking
into
consideration
that
oxygen
radicals
O,
indispensable for alkane oxydehydrogenation [5,6], may be
formed not only as a result of N2O decomposition but also by
oxygen adsorption on the transition metal oxide system [22] we
have also used oxygen for ethane oxidation. The use of oxygen
for propane oxidation in the presence of Fe-ZSM-5 zeolites [4]
resulted in very low propane conversion and also in very low
selectivity towards propene when compared to N2O applica-
tion. The main products in this reaction were oxygenates and
COx. Ethane oxidation with oxygen in the presence of iron
modiﬁed zeolite ZSM-5 resulted also in very low ethane
conversion, however, selectivity towards ethene was still high
(Fig. 10). This difference in the direction of propane and ethane
oxidation may also originate from the different stability of
oleﬁn being a main product of ODH reaction. The high stability

of ethene resulted from the high energy of C–H bonds, while
much weaker C–H bonds in propene led to further oxidation of
the ODH product towards oxygenates and COx.
The interaction of reagents (ethane and N2O) with active
centres in the range of temperature from RT to 400 8C was
performed in a vacuum cell and recorded by FT-IR spectra
(Fig. 11). The adsorption of reagents resulted in a simultaneous
decrease in the intensity of IR bands characteristic of OH groups.
This indicates a participation of OH groups in reagents
adsorption. Additionally, bands of the –C–H bond in the region
of 2880–2973 cm1 and a very weak band at about 3040 cm1
indicating the presence of
C–H bond were noted. The band at
3040 cm1, which conﬁrmed ethene formation appeared starting
from300 8C.IR spectra have also showntheformationof oxygen
containing species. The band at approximately 1715 cm1,
which can be ascribed to a carbonyl group present in aldehyde
[23], appeared already at 300 8C and its intensity rose up with
heating to 400 8C. A short evacuation at RT resulted in the
disappearanceallof thesebands. Propionaldehyde formationasa
result of propane oxidation over Fe-ZSM-5 in the presence of
N2O has also been reported by Kondratenko and Pe
´rez-Ramirez
[3]. However, acetaldehyde was not observed among the
products of ethane oxidation performed in the continuous ﬂow
reactor. This can be explained on the grounds of the mechanism
of ethane oxidation as suggested by Heracleous et al. [23].
According to quoted authors acetaldehyde formed in ethane
oxidation reaction is an intermediate in the total oxidation
process and is easily transformed to carbon oxides.
Nitrous oxide introduced into the reaction medium was partly
utilized for ethane oxidation and it was also directly decomposed
to N2 and O2 over iron modiﬁed catalysts. The activity for N2O
decomposition of iron modiﬁed zeolites was reported earlier
[12] and it has been found that concentration of iron cations
affects the rate constant signiﬁcantly. In the presented study
the conversion of N2O depended on the amount of iron in the
zeolite matrix and also on the kind of matrix (Fig. 12) applied to

iron complexes accommodation. The highest activity for N2O
decomposition showed iron modiﬁed ZSM-5 zeolites, while
the activity of faujasite and mordenite modiﬁed with iron
cations was lower when compared to Fe-ZSM-5 with a similar
amount of iron. On the other hand, iron modiﬁed faujasite did
not show any deactivation either for N2O decomposition or for
ethane oxidation during 4 h on stream. Both N2O decomposi-
tion and ethane oxidation depended on reaction temperature.
Ethane conversion at 350 and 370 8C was relatively low (up to
about 10 mol%) and increased notably at 400 8C. However,
further growth of temperature resulted only in a little change in
ethane conversion. Simultaneously, with the growth of reaction
temperature from 350 to 450 8C, N2O decomposition increased
considerably and at 450 8C no N2O remainder was recorded
(Fig. 13). Considering the above, the process of ethane
oxydehydrogenation with N2O as an oxidant in the presence of
iron modiﬁed zeolites may be treated both as an effective
method of light parafﬁns functionalisation and also as a useful
procedure for N2O utilization.
4. Conclusions
1. Iron modiﬁed zeolites (ZSM-5, mordenite, faujasite) show
activity for ethane oxydehydrogenation in the presence of
N2O as an oxidant, while iron compounds impregnated on
amorphous silica–alumina or silica did not show any activity
for ODH reaction.
2. Iron complexes accommodated in channels of ZSM-5 zeolite
show the highest activity for ODH reaction.
3. Iron complexes generated in silicalite of MFI structure and
activated under the same conditions as Fe-ZSM-5 did not
show any activity for ODH reaction. This indicates that not
only crystalline structure but also the net charge of the zeolite
matrix play signiﬁcant role in the formation of active iron
complexes.
4. The use of N2O as an oxidant for ethane oxydehydrogenation
results in simultaneous, effective N2O utilization.
