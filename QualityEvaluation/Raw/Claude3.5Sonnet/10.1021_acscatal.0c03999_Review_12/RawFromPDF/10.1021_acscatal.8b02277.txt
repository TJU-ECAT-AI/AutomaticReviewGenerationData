Abstract
Single-site catalysts (SSCs) have drawn considerable attention, because of their superior behaviors in catalysis. However, the origin of promoting the effect of a single site is not well understood. Here, we take the single-atom Ni1/Mg(100) and single-site Ni4/Mg(100) catalysts as a case study to elucidate their behaviors under the complex dry reforming of methane (DRM, CO2 + CH4→ 2CO + 2H2) reaction by combining theoretical modeling (density functional theory and kinetic Monte Carlo simulation) and experimental studies. The synergy between single Ni atom and MgO is found to improve the binding property of MgO; yet, it is not enough to dissociate CO2 and CH4. It can be achieved by the single-site Ni4/MgO(100) catalyst, enabling the formations of CO, H2, and H2O under the DRM conditions. During this process, coking, as observed for bulklike Ni particles, is eliminated. By confining the reaction to occur at the isolated Ni sites in the SSC, the Ni4/MgO(100) catalyst is able to balance the CO2 and CH4 activations, which is identified as the key for tuning the DRM activity and selectivity of Ni/MgO catalysts. The theory-identified promotion introduced by increasing the size of MgO-supported Ni clusters from Ni1 to Ni4 and the MgO-introduced site confinement of single-site catalysts are verified by corresponding experimental studies, highlighting the essential roles of confined sites in tuning the performance of SSCs during complex catalytic processes.

1. Introduction
Single-site catalysts (SSCs) have been found to not only promote the efficiency of expensive catalysts, but also result in the tuning of catalytic activity and selectivity for various important processes, e.g. water–gas shift (WGS) reaction, methane dissociation, CO oxidation, NO reduction, and oxygen reduction reaction. (1−8) Each site of a SSC is constructed by one or more atoms, has the same atomic arrangement, and provides the same binding energy to a reactant, with no spectroscopic or other crosstalk among such sites. (9) Thus, the SSCs are also beneficial for fundamental studies, enabling the quantitative comparison to corresponding homogeneous catalysts involving the same active centers. In addition, it allows the accurate description and mechanistic understanding from state-of-the-art theoretical modeling, which is devoted to evolve strategic principles for the design of improved catalysts. (3,5,6,10,11) Several mechanisms have been proposed for the promoting effect of SSCs, including the generation of low-coordinated active sites, increase of interaction with support, and/or synergy between active sites and support. (11−14) However, the contribution from each mechanism always interacts with each other, (3,10) and the catalytic nature is still not well understood, which hinders the rational development of SSCs. Besides, so far, the catalysis for SSCs has been performed for the relatively simple reactions. (7) By comparison, the performance within a complex reaction network, which involves multiple reaction intermediates and products, is given little attention.
In this study, a combined density functional theory (DFT) calculations and kinetic Monte Carlo (KMC) simulations together with the coordinative studies in experiment was employed and the complex dry reforming of methane (DRM, CO2 + CH4 → 2CO + 2H2) on single-atom Ni1/MgO(001) and single-site Ni4/MgO(001) model catalysts was used as a case study, aiming to understand the behavior of SSCs toward complex catalytic processes. The DRM is one of the effective ways for utilizing two of the greenhouse gases—carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4)—to produce syngas, (15−17) which can be used as the feedstock for catalytic processes, such as Fischer–Tropsch and methanol synthesis. (18−20) However, the conventional Ni catalysts for the DRM deactivate quickly, because of sintering of the active metal phase and carbon deposition via the Boudouard reaction (2CO → C + CO2) and/or CH4 decomposition (CH4 → C + 4H). (17,21−24) One of the solutions is the formation of small Ni particles supported on MgO (25−27) by reducing NiO–MgO solid solutions, being able to exhibit a high stability against metal sintering and a strong coking resistance. (28−32) Alternatively, several possibilities including Ni concentration, (33,34) the oxygen vacancies (Ovac) produced during the reduction, (30,35) and the electronic modification introduced by the strong Ni-MgO interaction have been proposed. (36) However, because of the complexity of the reaction, the origin of promoting effects remains elusive.
The combination of DFT and KMC allows us to gain better understanding of the reaction mechanism on the SSCs: the interplay of different reaction pathways, overall conversion and selectivity, source of carbon deposition (Boudouard reaction or CH4 decomposition)/elimination, the size effect of single Ni site, and the roles that the single Ni site and the MgO support play. In addition, the key descriptors that can control or selectively tune the conversion and selectivity are also provided. More importantly, the independent promoting effect of site confinement on the catalytic activity of the single-site Ni/MgO catalysts is identified by the KMC simulations, which is verified by corresponding experimental studies, highlighting the essential roles of confined sites in tuning the performance of SSCs during complex catalytic processes. Such fundamental insight can help in guiding the further optimization of Ni-based catalysts for the DRM reaction.
2. Methods
2.1. Theory
All the calculations were studied using DFT, which was implemented with the Vienna Ab Initio Simulation Package. (37−40) The spin-polarized generalized gradient approximation (GGA) with the PW91 functional and pseudopotential generated in the projector-augmented wave method were employed. (41) Although the GGA functional is not enough to accurately describe adsorption of small molecules on Ni/MgO(100), (42,43) it has been shown to works reasonably well to capture the difference in energy from one system to the next, (36,44−46) which is the interest in the current study. A 3 × 3 × 1 k-point mesh was used to sample the Brillouin zone. A cutoff energy of 400 eV was sufficient to obtain a satisfactory convergence of the total energy. The transition state (TS) search was performed by using the nudged elastic band (NEB) method, (47) where the identified transition state (TS) was confirmed by one imaginary frequency.
MgO(100) surface was modeled by a five-layer slab with a 3 × 3 array in each layer. Ni4/MgO(100) was built based on Ni1/MgO(100), which was described by replacing one of the Mg ions or filling in a Mg vacancy (Mgvac) in the surface by Ni (Figure 1a) or following the previous study of NiO–MgO solid solutions. (46) Here, we assumed that the substitution of one Mg atom by Ni does not change the MgO lattice. It is reasonable according to the previous study, showing that NiO is soluble in MgO in the entire composition range without significant changes in lattice parameters due to close ionic radii of Ni2+ and Mg2+. (48) In the case of Ni4/MgO(100), three Ni atoms were located over the Ni ion that resides at the Mg position and is available for the reaction, to form a Ni tetrahedron cluster with no Ovac (see Figure 1b). After relaxation, Ni4 cluster was slightly lifted from the surface and bound over the Mgvac site via Ni–O bonds. Such model was different from the previous study, where Ni4 either anchored on the ideal MgO(100) surface or occupied the Ovac site. (36) In the DFT calculations, the bottom two layers were fixed, and the other layers and the adsorbates were allowed to relax. In order to ensure no significant interaction between the layers, the vacuum region between adjacent slabs was 15 Å. The average magnetic moment per atom of Ni is 0.50 μB, which is slightly smaller than the experiment value (∼0.60 μB). (49) We also tested, using the GGA+U (U = 5.3 eV for Ni) (50,51) method for the binding of CO adsorption on Ni1/defected MgO(100), and the difference of binding energy is only 0.05 eV. Accordingly, the effect of Hubbard U was not included in this work. The adsorption energy (Eads) of reaction intermediates were calculated as
where E(adsorbate/surface), E(surface) and E(adsorbate) represent the total energy of surface with and without interaction with adsorbate, and the adsorbate in gas phase, respectively. The DFT method currently employed may not be accurate to calculate the absolute values of binding energies and activation barriers, which determine the DRM activity. However, as shown in the following, it is capable enough to capture the difference in binding and DRM activity induced by Ni size and site confinement observed experimentally, which is our interest here.

2.2. Experiment
2.2.1. Catalyst Preparation
Ni/MgO catalysts were prepared via a coprecipitation method. Typically, an aqueous solution of magnesium nitrate (1 M) was mixed with desired amount of nickel nitrate aqueous solution (1 M). The mixed solution then was added dropwise to the Na2CO3 solution (1 M) under vigorous stirring. The pH value was adjusted to 10 by adding the NaOH solution (10 M). The obtained mixture was kept at 75 °C for 1 h under stirring. Subsequently, the resulting gel was filtered and washed, then dried at 120 °C for overnight, followed by calcination at 850 °C for 5 h to obtain the final products. The obtained catalysts were denoted as 2.5% Ni/MgO, 5% Ni/MgO, and 10% Ni/MgO.
2.2.2. Catalyst Characterization
Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) were employed to characterize the structure and morphology of the Ni/MgO catalysts. High-resolution TEM (HRTEM) was performed on a Philips Model CM 200 facility operating at 200 kV. The high-angle annular dark field scanning transmission electron microscopy (HAADF-STEM) images and energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) spectra were recorded on a TEM system (JEOL, Model JEM-ARM200F) with an EDX detector. Similar to pretreatment for the activity test, the sample was reduced in hydrogen for 1 h and then was used for microscopic imaging. Under the reaction conditions, no obvious activity loss was observed for the catalysts. Therefore, no microscopic imaging was performed after reaction.
2.2.3. Catalytic Activity Test
The catalytic CO2 reforming of CH4 was performed under atmospheric pressure in a fixed-bed stainless steel reactor (300 mm long and 6 mm internal diameter) that was packed with 200 mg of catalyst. The catalyst was preheated under a nitrogen flow (20 mL/min) to 750 °C (heating rate 10 °C/min) and held at this temperature for 1 h. Prior to the reaction, the catalyst was reduced in situ at 750 °C for 1 h with a flow rate of 50% H2/N2 mixture gas (10 mL/min N2 and 10 mL/min H2) and cooled to 600 °C. The reactant gases, consisting of CH4 (15 mL/min), CO2 (15 mL/min), and N2 (15 mL/min) with a total flow of 45 mL/min, then were introduced into the reactor. The reaction temperature was increased from 600 °C to 800 °C in 50 °C increments with a heating rate of 10 °C/min and held for 0.5 h until the conversion was stabilized at each temperature. A Varian 490 Quad Micro-GC equipped with three thermal conductivity detectors (TCDs) with three columns (Agilent PoroBond Q, CPMolsiever 5A, and HayeSep Q) was used for H2, CO, CO2, and CH4 analysis.
3. Results and Discussion
3.1. DFT Calculation
3.1.1. DRM on MgO(100)
The DRM on MgO(100) surface was studied as a reference. CO2 prefers to occupy the Mg–O–Mg site, where two O atoms bind to two Mg sites, respectively, and C interacts with the O atom (see Figure S1 in the Supporting Information) to form carbonate-like (*CO3) species. The corresponding Eads value is −0.42 eV (see Table 1), which is in agreement with the experimental value of −0.41 eV. (52) The O═C═O bond is bent to an angle of 133.5° and the C–O bond is slightly elongated; however, the dissociation reaction, *CO2 + * → *CO + *O, is highly endothermic, with a reaction energy (ΔE) of 3.95 eV, as both *CO (Eads = −0.17 eV) and *O (Eads = −2.40 eV) interact with the surface weakly at the Mg and Mg–O–Mg hollow sites, respectively (see Figure 2 and Table 1), which is consistent with the previous studies. (53−55) For the same reason, CH4 decomposition is also unlikely. As observed in other studies, (54,56) CH4 is only physisorbed on the surface (Eads= −0.04 eV; see Table 1). The dehydrogenation is hindered both thermodynamically with ΔE of 2.40 eV and kinetically with barrier (Ea) of 2.59 eV, because of the low stability of methoxy (*CH3) species (Eads= −0.12 eV; see Table 1), which are barely adsorbed and stay away from the surface by ∼3 Å (Figure 2); yet, *H is fairly stable at the O site (Eads= −0.45 eV). Accordingly, the DRM should not occur on MgO(100), because of its low adsorption properties, as observed experimentally. (57)

We note that the step edge of MgO(100) was not considered in the current calculation. According to the calculations by Mazheika and Levchenko, similar enhancement in CO2 and CH4 adsorption energy was observed when going from the terrace sites to the step sites on both MgO and Ni1/MgO. (58) Thus, the difference in DRM activity between MgO and Ni1/MgO likely follows the same trend, which is one of our focuses in the current study.
3.1.2. DRM on Single-Atom Ni1/MgO(100) Catalysts
In Table 1, our calculations show that the formation of single-atom Ni1/MgO(100) catalysts does not vary the binding of *CH4 on MgO(100) and the corresponding adsorption energy remains as −0.04 eV. This is consistent with previous DFT calculations using the slab model and the HSE(0.3)+vdW functional, which shows a difference in binding energy of 0.02 eV. (58) In the case of *CO2 adsorption (see Table 1), the adsorption energy on the Mg–O–Ni site (Eads= −0.23 eV) is less than that of Mg–O–Mg site (Eads= −0.42 eV). That is, the Ni/MgO is not as favorable as MgO alone for *CO2 adsorption, which is also reported previously. (58) In our study, Ni1/MgO(100) binds CO more strongly than that on MgO(100) by 0.56 eV (see Table 1). The same trend is also observed by Mazheika and Levchenko. (58) Yet, the corresponding magnitude is different, which may be associated with the variation in Ni concentration on the surface.
SACs have been reported to well catalyze various catalytic processes. (7) However, for the complex DRM, our calculations show that this is not the case for the SAC Ni1/MgO(100). Compared to MgO(100) (see Figure S1 in the Supporting Information), the presence of isolated individual Ni1 cations on MgO(100), in cooperation with MgO, facilitates the *CH4 decomposition to *CH3 with ΔE = 1.36 eV and Ea = 1.57 eV (Figure S2 in the Supporting Information); yet, it is not as active as Ni(111) (59,60) and the sequential activation of *CH3 is still energetically difficult with Ea > 2.3 eV. In addition, the *CO2 dissociation is still very difficult (ΔE = 3.62 eV), because of the limited number of neighboring Ni sites, and, therefore, weak bindings to the reaction intermediates are observed, relative to that of MgO(100) (see Table 1). That is, the SAC Ni1/MgO(100) is not active enough to help for the C–O bond scission, C–H bond cleavage, and overall DRM reaction.
We also considered the effect of Ovac on Ni1/MgO(100), which was found to be energetically favorable at low Ni loading in our previous study. (46) The results show that the Ovac is not likely to survive under the DRM conditions. The presence of Ovac does not help to stabilize CH4 (Eads = −0.14 eV), but substantially increase the binding of CO2 (Eads = −2.45 eV). For *CO2, one of C–O bonds is nearly parallel over Ovac (see Figure S3 in the Supporting Information), resulting in the longer C–O bond of 1.33 Å and more-bent O═C═O bond angle of 118.9° than that of Ni1/MgO(100) and MgO(100). Similar promotion in stability over the Ovac site is also observed for *O and *CO (see Figure S3 in the Supporting Information). As a result, *CO2 dissociation is greatly facilitated (ΔE = −0.28 eV, Ea = 0.54 eV), where the dissociated *O fills the Ovac site. This is also the case for *CH4 dissociation to form CH3* (ΔE = 0.15 eV, Ea = 0.70 eV), *CH2 (ΔE = 0.60 eV, Ea = 1.35 eV), *CH (ΔE = 0.88 eV, Ea = 1.56 eV), and eventually *C (ΔE = 2.02 eV, Ea = 2.44 eV) to occupy the Ovac site (see Figure S3). According to the DFT calculations, *COx and *CHx species compete for the Ovac sites to gain the increased activity. However, the binding of CH4 is much weaker than that of CO2. That is, under the DRM conditions, the Ovac sites are mostly occupied by *CO2, followed by a facile C–O bond scission to fill the vacancy. Given that, the Ovac cannot survive. The defected Ni1/MgO(100) surface likely transforms back to a Ni1/MgO(100) surface and eventually loses activity toward the DRM. Accordingly, the Ovac was not considered in our Ni4/MgO(100) model as follows. The size increase of MgO-supported Ni cluster from Ni1 to Ni4 allows the formation of a Ni4 ensemble, which consists of three neighboring Ni sites to provide strong binding to the reactants and enable the proceeding of the DRM reaction.
3.1.3. DRM on Confined Single-Site Ni4/MgO(100) Catalysts
The binding capability of Ni1/MgO(100) can be enhanced by increasing the size of Ni sites from Ni1 to Ni4 (see Figure 1). A 3-fold hollow site is formed over a Ni4 cluster of Ni4/MgO(100) (see Figure 1b). It is constructed by the three Ni atoms, which are less positively charged than the underlying Ni atom embedded in the MgO(100) surface by ∼1 e, and, consequently, on Ni4/MgO(100), binds the reaction intermediates more strongly than that on Ni1/MgO(100) (see Table 1). Unlike the case of Ni1/MgO(100), all reaction intermediates solely prefer to adsorb at the Ni sites and MgO(100) does not participate in the reaction directly (see Figure 2). That is, if the Ni4 clusters are well-dispersed and isolated from each other by MgO (see Figure 1), all reactions are confined to occur within each individual Ni4 cluster. Accordingly, the effect of lateral interaction among the adsorbates on Eads, ΔE, and Ea cannot be ignored and plays aessential role in promoting the catalytic performance of Ni/MgO toward the DRM reaction, as demonstrated in the following.
3.1.4. CO2 on Ni4/MgO(100)
CO2 favors the Ni bridge site (Eads = −0.99 eV; see Table 1), where one of C–O bonds is stretched to 1.27 Å and the O–C–O bond angle is bent to 135.9° (see Figure 2); The increased binding of CO2 on Ni4/MgO(100) facilitates the dissociation to CO chemisorbed on the surface, *CO in our notation (ΔE = −0.70 eV and Ea = 0.35 eV; see Table 2), which is more facile than that on the Ni(111) surface (Ea = 0.42 eV). (59) Here, the *CO2 dissociation is confined to the same Ni4 cluster and the final state corresponds to the coadsorption of *CO + *O (Figure 3). This is due to the fact that MgO(100) is too inert to directly participate in the binding and allow the diffusion of adsorbed species among the isolated Ni clusters from one to another. Such site confinement by MgO can be released by increasing the coverage of Ni4 cluster, which allows the formation of neighboring Ni4 clusters, as shown in section 3.2. In this way, the *CO and *O fragments from *CO2 dissociation do not necessarily suffer the lateral repulsion; instead, they can diffuse separately to two neighboring Ni4 clusters (see Figure 2) under the reaction conditions to reach a stabilized final state, and an increase in Ea by 0.04 eV for the reverse step is observed. The energy for the forward step remains the same (Table 2). By comparison, such site confinement displays a more significant effect on the further decomposition of *CO to *C. In this case, the coadsorption of *C + *O (Figure 3) destabilizes the final state by 0.88 eV than the case with the separate adsorptions (Figure 2), which facilitates the reverse step, oxidation of *C to *CO (Ea = 0.56 eV vs Ea = 1.44 eV; see Table 2) significantly. Again, it does not affect the forward step and the corresponding Ea (1.90 eV) is much higher than that of Ni(111) (0.55 eV). (59) Thus, the single-site Ni4/MgO(100) likely facilitates the *C oxidation and may help in releasing the long-standing coking problem for Ni-based catalysts by hindering the *C formation from CO2 dissociation.

3.1.5. CH4 on Ni4/MgO(100)
Compared to CO2, the promotion for CH4 binding by size increasing is rather small (Eads= −0.17 eV). The dehydrogenation of *CH4 to *CH3 is also accelerated on Ni4/MgO(100) (ΔE = −0.36 eV and Ea = 0.53 eV; see Table 2) in comparison with Ni1/MgO(100) (Ea = 1.57 eV) and Ni(111) (Ea = 0.91 or 1.17 eV). (59) Interestingly, the corresponding Ea is also lower than those by simply depositing Ni4 cluster on ideal MgO(100) (Ea = 1.15 eV) and Al2O3 (Ea = 0.71 eV) surfaces. (36,59,61,62) In addition, the decomposition of *CH3 to *CH2 (ΔE = 0.21 eV and Ea = 0.55 eV; Table 2) and *CH (ΔE = 0.01 eV and Ea = 0.38 eV; Table 2) is facile, while the formation of *C is more difficult from *CH dissociation (ΔE = 0.63 eV and Ea = 1.06 eV; Table 2).
Like CO2 dissociation, the release of site confinement for CH4 dissociation allows the diffusion of dehydrogenated states, *CH3 + *H, from coadoption (Figure 3) to separate adsorption (Figure 2), which results in the stabilization and the increased Ea for the reverse hydrogenation steps. Such an effect is increasingly significant during the conversion from *CH4 to *C (Table 2), because of the requirement of highly symmetric sites (in particular, for stabilization of *CH and *C; see Figure 2) and, therefore, the strong lateral repulsion introduced by the coadsorbed *H.
3.1.6. Effect of *H on Ni4/MgO(100)
As a result of facile dissociations of CO2 and CH4 on Ni4/MgO(100), *H, *O and *C may be available on the surface during the DRM reaction. These surface species can open new pathways for the reaction of intermediates involved in the DRM reaction.
The *H species on the surface can either desorb in the form of H2 (ΔE = 1.42 eV; Table 2) or be involved in hydrogenation reactions. The presence of *H may enable the CO2 activation as reported previously for metal/oxide catalysts. (63−65) However, neither formate (*HCOO; ΔE = 0.07 eV and Ea = 1.39 eV) nor carboxyl (*HOCO: ΔE = 0.78 eV and Ea = 1.98 eV) is formed as favorably as the *CO2 dissociation (Ea = 0.22 eV). That is, the CO2 hydrogenation is unlikely, but is preferred, instead of direct dissociation. The *CO species can also be hydrogenated to *HCO (ΔE = 0.77 eV and Ea = 1.11 eV; Table 2) rather than *COH (ΔE = 1.27 and Ea = 2.87 eV; Table 2), which is more favorable than the formation of *C via either C–O bond scission (ΔE = 1.34 and Ea = 1.90 eV; Table 2) or Boudouard reaction (ΔE = 0.63 and Ea = 3.49 eV; Table 2). According to the KMC simulations below, neither process can compete with *CO desorption, because of the entropic contribution under the DRM conditions. In addition, the hydrogenation of *O to *OH on the surface (ΔE = 0.19 eV and Ea = 1.13 eV; Table 2) is possible; yet, the reverse step is slightly preferred. By comparison, the hydrogenation of *OH to *H2O is more difficult both thermodynamically and kinetically (ΔE = 1.34 eV and Ea = 1.80 eV; Table 2) and the reverse step is more preferential. The following KMC simulations show that desorption of *H2O is facile under reaction conditions, because of the entropic contribution of H2O gas. Therefore, the *OH species cannot be observed on the surface. For both *CO and *O hydrogenations, the confinement effect introduced by the coadsorption with *H is small.
3.1.7. Effect of *O on Ni4/MgO(100)
The *O species on the surface can directly oxidize *CHx to *CHxO species or assist the dissociation of *CHx via the formation of *OH. The effect may also be indirect via destabilization of the dehydrogenated states due to lateral repulsion. For the first C–H bond breaking of *CH4, the direct participation of *O, or the oxidative dehydrogenation in our notation, stabilizes the dissociated *H by the formation of *OH (ΔE = −0.88 eV), compared to the case without *O (ΔE = −0.36 eV), or the nonoxidative dehydrogenation in our notation, while without direct participation, the presence of *O results in a less-negative reaction energy (ΔE = −0.32 eV). In both cases, the *O species on the surface slightly raises the barrier for C–H bond breaking (Ea = 0.62 eV, 0.60 eV vs 0.53 eV; Table 2). A similar situation is observed for the second and third C–H bond cleavages of *CH4, where the direct dissociation on the bare Ni sites (Ea = 0.55 eV for *CH3, 0.38 eV for *CH2) is more favorable than the case in the presence of *O with or without the formation of *OH (Ea = 0.83 eV and 0.64 eV for *CH3, 0.78 and 0.70 eV for *CH2; Table 2). For both *CH3 and *CH2, the oxidation to form *CHxO is highly activated (Ea = 1.44 eV for *CH3, 1.16 eV for *CH2, Table 2), because of their strong interactions with the Ni sites. However, this is not the case for *CH, where the formation of *CHO is favored (ΔE = −0.12 eV, Ea = 0.75 eV) over the dissociation step to produce *C (Ea > 1 eV; Table 2). The formed *CHO then either dissociates to *CO (ΔE = −0.77 and Ea = 0.34 eV; Table 2) or hydrogenates to *CH2O (ΔE = 0.27 eV and Ea = 0.57 eV; Table 2), rather than undergoing hydrogenation to *CHOH (ΔE = 0.53 eV and Ea = 1.12 eV; Table 2). Eventually, *CO desorbs from the surface, while *CH2O is hydrogenated to either *CH3O (ΔE = 0.08 eV and Ea = 0.80 eV; Table 2) or *CH2OH (ΔE = 0.90 eV and Ea = 0.95 eV; Table 2) and finally *CH3OH (ΔE = 0.87 eV and Ea = 1.72 eV via *CH3O; ΔE = 0.52 eV and Ea = 1.51 eV via *CH2OH; Table 2). Accordingly, the formation of *C seems very difficult: *CO is more preferred on Ni4/MgO(100).
3.1.8. Effect of *C on Ni4/MgO(100)
Under the extreme situation that *C is formed on Ni4/MgO(100), there are three possible pathways for carbon elimination: the first is recombination to form a C–C chain (*C + *C → *C2 + *); the second is oxidation (*C + *O → *CO + *); the third is reverse Boudouard reaction (*C + *CO2 → *CO + *CO), which proceeds via *CCOO intermediate. Among them, the C–C chain formation on the Ni4 cluster is the most preferred, with Ea values as low as 0.08 eV; by comparison, the other routes are less competitive (recall Table 2), which correspond to a higher barrier (Ea = 0.56 eV for oxidation, Ea = 0.66 eV for *CCOO formation, and Ea = 1.37 eV for *CCOO + *→ 2*CO). Therefore, to avoid coking, the coverage of *C should be minimized, to prevent facile carbon accumulation on Ni4/MgO(100).
Overall, the DFT calculations clearly addressed the energetics involved the reaction network for the DRM on Ni1,4/MgO(100). The single-atom Ni1/MgO(100) catalyst cannot catalyze the DRM reaction, as the Ni sites are too inert and are limited to activate CH4 and CO2. The growth of Ni1 to Ni4 provides adequate and active Ni sites, being able to provide binding strong enough to activate CO2 and CH4, but weak enough to avoid coking. Again, if the site confinement is released, the stability of reactant or products—and, therefore, ΔE and Ea—change accordingly for each elementary step involved in the DRM reaction.
However, it is not clear how the energetics calculated using DFT affects the reaction kinetics under the DRM reaction conditions: the dominant pathways, the overall conversion rate, and the selectivity among CO, H2, H2O, and CH3OH, the resources for carbon deposition and elimination, the key descriptors to promote the catalytic performance, and, more importantly, the role of site confinement of Ni cluster supported on Mg(100) in tuning the catalytic activity of Ni/MgO. To answer these questions, KMC simulations were conducted to describe the DRM reaction over Ni4/MgO(100) based on the DFT calculations.
3.2. KMC Simulations
The KMC simulations included 45 elementary steps identified in the DFT calculations (Table 2). The rate constant for reaction N was described as
where QTS and QR are the partition functions per unit volume for a transition state and a reactant, respectively, while Ea,N is a predicted reaction barrier for reaction N. Predicted prefactors (A) at various temperatures are listed in Table S1 in the Supporting Information. The terms kB, T, and h represent the Boltzmann constant, the temperature and Planck’s constant, respectively. For the reactions involving molecules in the gas phase, the contribution from the entropy is taken from the NIST database (66) and is included in the KMC simulations. The adsorption coefficient (kads) was calculated according to the expression (67)
where P is the pressure of the adsorption gas, Asite the area of a single site, σ the sticking coefficient, and m the mass of adsorption gas. Both forward and backward reactions are included in the KMC model. The turnover frequency (TOF) is estimated as
where is the number of occurrences for a reaction and is counted according to the KMC simulations.
To address the role of site confinement on the catalytic performance of Ni4/Mg(100), two surface matrixes are constructed. One is in the format of SSC with site confinement, where each Ni4 ensemble consists of three neighboring Ni atoms and are well-dispersed on the MgO(100) support (see Figure 4a). Since MgO is too inert to participate in the reaction directly according to DFT calculations in section 3.1, the overall DRM reaction is confined to occur at Ni triangle sites of a Ni4 cluster and there is no diffusion of adsorbates from one cluster to another. As a result, in many cases, the effect of coadsorption involving two or three adsorbed species as initial/final states must be considered (see Table 2). The other is the Ni4/Mg(100) catalyst without site confinement, or nonconfined Ni4/Mg(100) in our notation. It was constructed by increasing the coverage of Ni4 on MgO(100) to a level high enough to allow connection of three exposed Ni sites of Ni4 (see Figure 4b). Compared to the case with site confinement (Figure 4a), the nonconfined Ni4/Mg(100) catalyst (Figure 4b) provided the larger area of Ni sites, while the binding and catalytic activity of each Ni site was assumed to remain the same. In this way, the site confinement of single-site Ni4/Mg(100) catalyst is partially released. Each elementary can occur over the large area constructed by many neighboring Ni4 clusters, rather than being limited within an isolated Ni4 cluster of single-site Ni4/Mg(100) catalyst (Figure 4). As a result, for a reaction involving two adsorbed surface species, for example, each of them can reside in the most stable site, which can be away from each other to avoid lateral repulsion. This is followed by diffusion, coadsorption, and finally reaction as the case with site confinement. Similar situation was assumed for the final states, enabling the diffusion of the produced surface species from the neighboring coadsorption sites to the stable location without lateral repulsion. Following this idea, the description of DRM on Ni4/Mg(100) catalyst with and without site confinement uses different sets of energies (see Table 2).
Figure 4
Figure 4. KMC-simulated surface matrix for the Ni4/MgO(100) (a, c) with and (b, d) without site confinement before (panels (a) and (b)) and during the DRM reaction at 700 °C and 1 atm with CO2:CH4 ratio of 1. [Legend: gray, MgO; blue, Ni; and red, *O.]
According to the DFT calculations, the release of site confinement promotes the stability of initial/final sites including two or three adsorbed species and tunes the corresponding ΔE and Ea, as demonstrated in section 3.1. When going from the single-site Ni4/MgO(100) catalyst to the nonconfined case, only the ensemble of active sites varies, featured by the increasing coverage of Ni4 and partial lift of site confinement, while the electronic contribution associated with the release of site confinement can be excluded. In this way, the comparison in catalytic performance of the two model systems allows us to identify the independent effect of site confinement of SSCs.
We note that the diffusion barriers were not included in the KMC simulations. For the confined single-site Ni4/MgO(100) catalyst, the diffusion of an adsorbate is not necessary to enable the reaction to occur within the limit of Ni4 cluster. In addition, the diffusion among Ni4 clusters isolated by MgO was limited, because of the high preference of the reaction intermediates to the Ni sites of Ni4/MgO over MgO sites (see Table 1). In the case of nonconfined Ni4/MgO(100), the diffusion of an adsorbate from one Ni site to the neighboring ones was assumed to be facile in consideration of high temperature for the DRM reaction.
3.2.1. Activity and Selectivity of Confined Single-Site Ni4/MgO(100) Catalysts
According to our KMC simulations, the single-site Ni4/MgO(100) catalyst is able to catalyze the DRM well, ranging from 600 °C to 900 °C and at 1 atm with a CO2:CH4 ratio of 1. Three products are observed, including CO, H2, and H2O, and CH3OH is not observed (see Figure 5a). In terms of selectivity, CO is the major product (∼58% at 700 °C), while the yield of H2 and H2O (∼21% for each at 700 °C) is less. The increase in temperature, from 600 °C to 900 °C, is able to enhance the yield of all three products (see Figure 5a).
Figure 5
Figure 5. KMC simulated turnover frequency (TOF) for (a) the production of CO, H2, and H2O and (b) the H2/CO ratio for the DRM reaction on the confined single-site Ni4/MgO(100) catalyst from 600 °C to 900 °C at 1 atm with a CO2:CH4 ratio of 1.
Both CH4 and CO2 are sources for CO production. Because of the faster activation of CO2 than CH4, the contribution from CO2 is more significant than that from CH4. CH4 provides the only hydrogen source to produce both H2 and H2O. The selectivity to H2 and H2O is always lower than that to CO (Figure 5b). With the temperature increasing from 600 °C to 900 °C, both the H2/CO ratio and the H2/H2O ratio increase (see Figure 5b). That is, the CH4 conversion is increased more significantly than that of CO2; yet, the former cannot compete with the latter within the temperature range studied. Our results agree well with the experimental results on the conventional NiO–MgO–Al2O3 catalyst, showing that the conversion and selectivity to H2 increase with the temperature, although both values are lower than the previously reported values. (34) More importantly, the only stable reaction intermediate observed during the reaction is *O and the carbon deposition is completely eliminated on the single-site Ni4/MgO(100) catalyst (see Figure 4c).
3.2.2. Reaction Pathway of the Confined Single-Site Ni4/MgO(100) Catalyst
To simplify the complex reaction network for the DRM reaction on the single-site Ni4/MgO(100) catalyst, among the 45 steps studied (Table 2), only those that are observed to significantly contribute to the reaction rate are identified by the KMC simulations and are considered as part of the preferential pathway (see Figure 6). Our results show that the reaction starts with the facial CO2 dissociation to *CO and *O and *CO desorption as CO gas. The formed *O is stable and occupies one-third of the Ni sites exposed on the surface (see Figure 4c). It opens the new oxidative mechanism for CH4 dehydrogenation to *CH3 via the *OH intermediate. The further oxidative dehydrogenation to *CH3 produces *CH2 and H2O, together with the removal of *O from the surface. Yet, the first and second C–H bond cleavages of CH4 are preferred via nonoxidative mechanisms (see Table 2), which competes for the three free Ni sites with the *CO2 dissociation. However, the *CO2 dissociation is more facile than that of CH4 (see Tables 1 and 2, and Figure 7). It enhances the possibility of the presence of *O on the surface (one-third of Ni sites; see Figure 4c) and the CH4 dehydrogenation is forced to occur via the oxidative mechanism, which shows the higher TOF than that via the nonoxidative pathway (see Figure 7). At the elevated temperatures, the preference for the *CO2 dissociation over the oxidative and dehydrogenation of CH4 is increased; while the promotion for the nonoxidative CH4 dehydrogenation is rather small (see Figure 7).

Figure 7
Figure 7. KMC-simulated turnover frequency (TOF) for CO2 + * → *O + CO, CH4 + 2* → *CH3 + *H and CH4 + *O + * → *CH3 + *OH involved in the DRM reaction on the confined single-site Ni4/MgO(100) catalyst from 600 °C to 900 °C at 1 atm with CO2:CH4 ratio of 1.
The *CH2 that is produced undergoes two successive nonoxidative dehydrogenations, to form *CH and *C, which is accompanied by the production of H2 (see Figure 6). Although the *CH nonoxidative dehydrogenation to *C corresponds to a higher barrier than the oxidation to *CHO, according to the DFT calculations (see Table 2), the presence of *CH2 or *CH hinders the CO2 approaching and dissociation due to the steric repulsion and, therefore, there is no *O at the neighboring site of *CH. For the same reason, the contribution from the oxidative dehydrogenation of *CH2 is small, which results in the formation of H2O instead of H2.
The resource for *C is dominantly from the *CH2 successive dehydrogenation via the nonoxidative mechanism (see Figure 6), rather than the Boudouard reaction, where ∼80% undergoes the reverse step back to *CH and, therefore, *CH2, and the rest are eliminated via either oxidation or the reverse Boudouard reaction to form *CO via *CCOO intermediate. This is consistent with the previous studies on Ni(hkl) surfaces, proposing that the carbon deposition is from *CH dissociation and *C elimination is mainly due to oxidation and hydroxylation. (62,68) Yet, the main resource for *C was recently suggested from the Boudouard reaction on Ni(111). (69) However, different from pure Ni catalysts, carbon deposition, which is the long-standing problem for Ni-based DRM catalysts, can be completely eliminated by forming the single-site Ni4 cluster isolated on MgO(100), according to our KMC simulations, showing that no *C is present on the surface during the reaction (see Figure 4c). Such a single-site Ni/MgO(100) catalyst is able to not only limit *C accumulation via *CH dehydrogenation, but also enhances the *C elimination via oxidation or reverse Boudouard reaction.
According to the KMC simulations, the DRM on the single-site Ni4/MgO(100) catalyst is dominated by *CO2 dissociation to *CO and *O, which is the main contribution for the production of CO (Figure 6). CH4 is the only resource for *H or H2 and *C or carbon deposition; however, the CH4 dehydrogenation is not as favorable as that of the CO2 dissociation. As a result, under reaction conditions, the active Ni sites are always partially covered by *O at a coverage of 1/3 ML (see Figure 4c), and *O is the only observable species on Ni4/Mg(100). One of the drawbacks is that one-third of Ni sites are blocked by *O, which hinders the CO2 dissociation and, in particular, the nonoxidative CH4 dehydrogenation. Nevertheless, the partial coverage of *O does not poison the catalyst as completely as that of *C on Ni catalysts. It acts as an oxidizing agent, to enable the oxidative dehydrogenation of CH4 to *CH2 and, therefore, the formation of H2, *H oxidation to *OH, and, therefore, the formation of H2O and the formation of CO from *C (see Figures 3 and 6). Yet, the H2/CO ratio for Ni4/Mg(100) is <1. This is due to the hindering of nonoxidative CH4 dissociation on the *O partially covered Ni4/Mg(100), which allows 100% conversion of the formed *H to H2. Instead, the only way to produce H2 is via the oxidative dehydrogenation of CH4, where the dissociated *H is consumed by the formation of both H2 and H2O. This is very important for the many catalytic processes using H2 and CO mixture as feedstocks, e.g., Fischer–Tropsch reactions and methanol synthesis, which typically require high H2/CO ratio to ensure the high conversion and selectivity. (70,71)
3.2.3. Key Descriptor
To improve the yield of CO and H2 and the H2 selectivity, the sensitivity analysis was performed to identify the keys that control the activity and selectivity. Each Ea value in the KMC model is shifted by a small amount from its original value, ±0.4 eV in this case, and the other parameters are kept constant. (72,73) It is found that the overall conversion and selectivity of Ni4/MgO(100) toward the DRM reaction are controlled by the Ea values of three steps or descriptors. To increase the conversion of CH4, one way is to facilitate the nonoxidative dehydrogenation of *CH4 via lowering the Ea for *CH4 + * → *CH3 + *H (see Figure 8a). As a result, the yield for all three products is promoted. More importantly, the increase in yield is less significant for CO than H2, while the least effect is observed for H2O. As shown in Figure 6, the accelerated nonoxidative CH4 dehydrogenation indeed enables the balance with CO2 dissociation, which promotes the pathway to allow the 100% conversion of *H to H2. Therefore, enhancing nonoxidative CH4 dehydrogenation on the single-site Ni4/MgO(100) catalyst helps to effectively increase the overall yield and the selectivity to H2 (Figure 8b). A similar increase in production is observed in the presence of *O (Figure 8c), where the increase of overall yield with the reduced Ea value for oxidative CH4 dehydrogenation, *CH4 + *O → *CH3 + *OH, is more significant than that for nonoxidative dehydrogenation (Figure 8a). Again, the balance between CH4 and CO2 activation can be essential to promote the overall conversion and production for the DRM reaction on Ni4/MgO(100). However, the facilitated oxidative CH4 dehydrogenation has little effect on the H2/CO ratio (Figure 8d). Although there is more *H produced, it equally promotes both H2 and H2O production along the oxidative pathway (Figure 6). On the other hand, the increase in Ea can block the oxidative dehydrogenation and therefore populate the nonoxidative dehydrogenation of CH4, which is able to effectively enhance the H2/CO ratio (Figure 8d); yet, the conversion and production remain the same. That is, the suppression of oxidative CH4 dehydrogenation is able to selectively enhance the selectivity toward H2. The increased Ea for the reversion of *CH2 dehydrogenation, *CH + *H → *CH2 + *, can stabilize *CH and promote the formation of H2 from *CH2 successive dehydrogenation (Figure 6). As a result, the H2 yield and the corresponding selectivity is selectively accelerated, while the CO and H2O productions are suppressed (see Figures 8e and 8f). However, for the single-site Ni4/MgO(100) catalyst, tuning the stability of *CH does not impact the yield and selectivity as significantly as that of CH4 dehydrogenation (see Figures 8a–d).
Figure 8
Figure 8. Sensitivity in turnover frequency (TOF) of H2, CO, and H2O and the H2/CO ratio during the DRM reaction on the confined single-site Ni4/MgO(100) catalyst to the activation energies of (a, b) CH4* + * → *CH3 + *H, (c, d) CH4* + *O → *CH3 + *OH, and (e, f) *CH + *H → *CH2 at 700 °C and 1 atm with a CO2:CH4 ratio of 1. The zero-energy point corresponds to the DFT-calculated Ea value.
The sensitivity analysis clearly shows that, for the single-site Ni4/MgO(100) catalyst, the *CO2 dissociation is faster than that of *CH4. To achieve a balance between the two processes and increase the overall yield effectively, the *CH4 dehydrogenation via either nonoxidative or oxidative pathways should be facilitated (see Figures 9a and 9c). We also test the suppression of CO2 scission, which does not show a significant effect within the applied variation range in energy, ±0.4 eV. That is, the C–O bond breaking should be deactivated severely. Such a big change may also affect other steps as well and cannot be handled by the current sensitivity analysis. Wherein, the acceleration of nonoxidative CH4 dehydrogenation enables the promotion of both yield and H2/CO ratio. In the case of oxidative CH4 dehydrogenation, the facilitation results in selective enhancement in the yield and the suppression enables selective increases in the H2/CO ratio.

3.2.4. Role of Site Confinement
The combined DFT and KMC simulations show that the confined single-site Ni4/MgO(100) catalyst is able to catalyze the DRM reaction and completely eliminate the carbon deposition. Now, the question is whether the formation of SSCs is beneficial. The low-coordinated sites of Ni4 cluster and the strong interaction between Ni4 and MgO(100) modifies the electronic structures of Ni atoms and, therefore, their binding properties, as previously reported for various metal/oxide catalysts. (3,5,6,10,11) Such electronic effect interplays with the site confinement to catalyze the DRM on the single-site Ni4/MgO(100) catalyst. Using the nonconfined Ni4/MgO(100) model (recall Figure 4b), the confinement of the reaction within an isolated Ni site is removed, as indicated above.
Our KMC results show that, under the DRM conditions, the confined single-site Ni4/MgO(100) catalyst starts with a big spike for CO production, which decays and reaches to a steady state with time (see Figure 9a). The production of H2 during this process is also observed and the corresponding TOF is lower than that of CO. According to the identified reaction pathway (recall Figure 6), the initial CO spike is due to the rapid CO2 dissociation. This leads to the Ni sites being partially covered by *O (Figure 4c), which slows the CO2 dissociation and reaches a steady state. Without the site confinement, Ni4/MgO(100) behaves differently. After the big CO peak at the initial stage, the reaction stops quickly and the H2 production is not observed (see Figure 9b). In this case, the CO2 dissociation is populated more significantly than the case with site confinement. This is due to the fact that the release of site confinement introduces the decrease in Ea of CO2 dissociation from 1.49 eV to 0.35 eV (Table 2). As a result, the coverage of *O on the Ni sites increases from 1/3 ML (Figure 4c) to 2/3 ML (Figure 4d). Thus, the free sites required for CO2 and CH4 dissociation are not sufficient and, therefore, the entire reaction stops. That is, the single-site Ni4/MgO(100) catalyst is deactivated by removing the site confinement, although the binding of active Ni sites remains the same.
According to the sensitivity analysis, balancing the activation of CO2 and CH4 is essential to promote the DRM reaction on Ni/MgO catalysts. Indeed, by confining the reaction to occur at the isolated three Ni sites, the single-site Ni4/MgO(100) catalyst slows the facial CO2 dissociation to a level, which provides enough oxidizing agent, *O, to prevent the carbon deposition, but still allows the CH4 dehydrogenation via the oxidative mechanism to catch up. This is different from the previously reported promotional effect of site confinement in catalysis for SACs, two-dimensional layered materials, porous materials, interfacial materials, and nanotubes, (7,74−78) where the direct participation of the environmental sites within the confined area via various forms is necessary to facilitate the defect generation, the bond formation, or bond cleavage. The confined single-site Ni4/MgO(100) catalyst forces the adsorption of reaction intermediates to occur at the three neighboring Ni sites provided by each isolated Ni4 cluster, enabling the direct interplay among the adsorbates to tune the binding, the reaction barrier for elementary steps, and the overall catalytic performance. Our results highlight the essential roles of confined sites in tuning the catalytic performance in single-site catalysis. One must be very careful when using SSCs. Increasing the loading of supported particles may release the site confinement, which can have significant effect on the catalytic performance.
According to our calculations, the DRM catalysis on the confined single-site Ni4/MgO(100) catalyst is dependent on the well interplay between Ni and MgO. The three Ni atoms on the top of Ni4 cluster are the only active sites, which participate in the reaction directly to allow the adsorption of reactant, the generation of reaction intermediates, and removal of the product. The underneath Ni atom, which is embedded in the Mgvac site, is not exposed for adsorption. Instead, it acts as a contact point with the MgO support. Finally, MgO alone is not active for the DRM reaction and does not involve in the reaction directly, even in combination with Ni4 as the SSC. However, it plays indirect roles. On one hand, the Mgvac on MgO provides a strong anchor for Ni4 to strengthen the metal–support interaction and prevent the diffusion and aggregation of Ni4 cluster, which can result in the carbon deposition during the DRM reaction; on the other hand, the inert nature of MgO to the reaction ensures the isolation of Ni4 clusters and, therefore, the site confinement of Ni4/MgO(100), which is key to the DRM proceeding.
3.3. Experimental Verification
To verify the theory-identified effect of site confinement on the catalytic performance of Ni/MgO catalysts during the DRM reaction, the experimental studies was performed accordingly. The HRTEM (see Figure S4 in the Supporting Information) and elemental mapping images (Figure 10) were applied to investigate the size distribution on the synthesized Ni/MgO catalysts. It shows that most of the Ni species in Ni/MgO are well-mixed throughout the MgO matrix at low Ni loadings (2.5%, 5%, and 10%; see Figure 10, as well as Figure S4). Mainly, Ni particles with a size centered at 0.3 nm (1–2 Ni atoms; see Figure S5a in the Supporting Information) can be observed for 2.5% Ni/MgO. As the Ni loading increases to 5%, there is a slight increase in Ni particle size, centered within 0.6–0.8 nm (3–4 Ni atoms; see Figures S5b in the Supporting Inforamtion and Figure 10b). However, going from 5% to 10%, the size distribution of Ni cluster remains and the Ni clusters with 3–4 Ni atoms are still the majority, while the corresponding coverage increases (see Figure 10c, a swell as Figure S5c in the Supporting Information). In addition, the large Ni particles, centered at ca. 1.1 nm, was observed in 5% Ni/MgO and 10% Ni/MgO, because of the increased Ni loading (see Figures S5b and S5c). Yet, the corresponding amount is approximately the same for both cases. Thus, the difference in DRM activity between 5% Ni/MgO and 10% Ni/MgO, which is our interest here, is likely associated with the variation in coverage of Ni clusters with 3–4 Ni atoms.

The synthesized Ni/MgO catalysts with different Ni loadings can represent the structural difference in our theoretical models in Section 3.1 well. The 2.5% Ni/MgO sample (Figure 10a and Figure S4a) describes the Ni1/MgO, where single Ni atoms are isolated from each other by MgO (recall Figure 1a). The 5% Ni/MgO sample (Figure 10b and Figure S4b) likely corresponds to the confined single-site Ni4/MgO catalyst, with each Ni cluster separated by MgO (see Figure 4a). The 2.5% Ni/MgO and 5% Ni/MgO samples have similar atomic dispersions of Ni on the MgO surface, and the only difference is the cluster size, which is also represented by the structural difference between Ni1/MgO and Ni4/MgO (Figure 1). Upon going from 5% to 10% Ni/MgO, the difference in structure has a tendency to capture the effect of site confinement, which corresponds to an increase in coverage of the Ni clusters (Figure 4b), rather than the particle size (Figure 10c and Figure S5c). Yet, the amount of nonconfined Ni clusters in the 10% Ni/MgO is not as extensive as that in the nonconfined confined Ni4/MgO (see Figure 4b).
Under the DRM conditions, no carbon deposition was observed for all three Ni/MgO catalysts, which agrees with the theoretical studies. It is shown that 2.5% Ni/MgO displays almost no activity (see Figure S6 in the Supporting Information). As the Ni loading increases to 5%, not only the conversion of CH4 (Figure S5a) and CO2 (Figure S6b), but also the production of H2 (Figure S6c) and CO (Figure S6d) emerge and increase with the temperature under the DRM conditions, which is also observed by the KMC simulations (Figure 5). Similar behavior is also observed for 10% Ni/MgO (Figure S6) and the corresponding conversion and production are higher than that of 5% Ni/MgO; yet, the magnitude of the increase is not as significant as that observed when going from 2.5% Ni/MgO to 5% Ni/MgO.
To improve the comparability in activity among the Ni/MgO catalysts with different Ni loadings, the measured activities of Ni/MgO catalysts were expressed based on the reactant conversion per amount of Ni loaded (see Figure 11). Obviously, 5% Ni/MgO exhibits the highest activity, in comparison with both 2.5% Ni/MgO and 10% Ni/MgO. As predicted by the DFT calculations, the Ni/MgO with the low Ni loading (SAC Ni1/MgO in modeling and 2.5% Ni/MgO in experiment) is too inert to activate both CH4 and CO2 during the DRM. Both KMC simulations (Figure 5) and experimental activity testing (Figure 11) show that, with the same dispersion, increasing the size of each Ni cluster to the confined single-site Ni4/MgO catalysts in modeling and 5% Ni/MgO in the experiment enables the formation of neighboring Ni sites, which can work together and significantly boost the activity of Ni/MgO. The further increase in Ni loading can selectively promote the coverage of Ni clusters and enable the formation of connected Ni assembles, rather than the size of Ni cluster (nonconfined Ni4/MgO in modeling and 10% Ni/MgO in experiment), which allows the identification of site confinement effect. Experimentally, 10% Ni/MgO is not as active as 5% Ni/MgO (Figure 11). This is due to the formation of connected Ni cluster assembles, which partially releases the site confinement for the SSC and results in the poisoning of Ni sites by *O, according to the KMC simulations (see Figure 4d). However, the amount of nonconfined Ni4 ensembles in 10% Ni/MgO (Figure 10c) is not as significant as that in nonconfined Ni4/MgO in modeling (see Figure 4b). As a result, the DRM activity can still be measured experimentally on 10% Ni/MgO (see Figure 11) due to the supported Ni clusters, which still remain as confined SSCs, while no activity is observed for the nonconfined Ni4/MgO in modeling (Figure 9b). In fact, the actual amount of confined Ni clusters in 10% Ni/MgO is more than that in 5% Ni/MgO, which is demonstrated by the higher total conversion and production (see Figure S5).

Overall, formation of the confined single-site Ni/MgO catalyst is essential to catalyze the DRM reaction on NiO–MgO solid solution. A moderate amount of Ni, in our case 5%, should be chosen to intermix with MgO, as observed experimentally. According to the present theoretical calculations and experiments, if the Ni loading is too low (2.5% in our case) and the SAC Ni1/MgO catalyst is formed under reducing conditions, Ni is embedded in the MgO matrix and remains ionic. As a result, the catalyst binds the reaction intermediates too weakly and the number of neighboring Ni sites is too limited to catalyze the complex DRM reaction. If the Ni loading is high, even 10% in our case, the site confinement of the single-site Ni4/MgO catalyst can be partially lifted, which results in the poisoning of active Ni sites by *O. Thus, NiO–MgO solid solution with a high content of Ni shows low stability. Therefore, a NiO–MgO solid solution with a suitable Ni loading (5% in our case) allows the formation of single-site Ni4/MgO catalysts, which shows high activity and stability. It binds more strongly than the SAC Ni1/MgO catalyst and a sufficient number of neighboring Ni sites work cooperatively to balance the activation of CO2 and CH4 and, therefore, the H2/CO ratio, while still being able to maintain the site confinement for each Ni cluster to eliminate the poisoning by *O.
4. Conclusion
The performances of single-site Ni/MgO catalysts, during the DRM reaction, were systemically studied by combining theoretical modeling (DFT and KMC simulations) and experimental studies. The DFT calculations show that the synergy between single Ni atoms and MgO in the SAC Ni1/MgO is not active, because of the weak bindings to the reaction intermediates, relative to that of MgO, and the limited number of neighboring active sites. This is confirmed by the experiment on the 2.5% Ni/MgO catalyst including small Ni clusters of 1–2 Ni atoms. By increasing the Ni size, the single-site Ni4/MgO catalyst is able to provide stronger bindings than Ni1/MgO. It offers enough active Ni sites isolated from each other, which are able to work cooperatively for activation of both CH4 and CO2, enable the production of CO, H2, and H2O, and completely eliminate carbon deposition, which is also observed experimentally on the 5% Ni/MgO catalyst, including Ni clusters of 3–4 Ni atoms.
According to the KMC simulations, the site confinement of single-site Ni4/MgO catalysts helps to balance the activations of CO2 and CH4, which is essential not only to achieve the high yield and the H2/CO ratio of 1, but also to prevent the poisoning of active sites during the DRM reaction. It is able to slow the facial CO2 dissociation to a level that provides enough oxidizing agent (*O) to prevent the carbon deposition, but still allows the oxidative dehydrogenation of CH4. The complete release of site confinement, nonconfined Ni4/MgO, facilitates the CO2 dissociation and results in the deactivated Ni sites by *O and hinders the DRM reaction. Similar deactivation in DRM activity introduced by removing the site confinement is also verified experimentally on the 10% Ni/MgO catalyst, which enables the partial formation of nonconfined Ni4 assemblies and, therefore, removal of site confinement of 5% Ni/MgO.
The catalytic performance of confined single-site Ni4/MgO catalyst during the DRM reaction is dependent on the well interplay between Ni and MgO. The Ni cluster provides the only active sites, which participate in the reaction directly. MgO plays indirect roles. It offers the Mgvac as a strong anchor for Ni clusters to prevent the aggregation of Ni cluster and therefore the carbon deposition; on the other hand, the inert nature of MgO to the reaction ensures the isolation and the site confinement of single-site Ni4/MgO catalysts, which is key for the proceeding of the DRM. Our study identifies the essential roles of confined sites in tuning the catalytic performance in single-site catalysis.
