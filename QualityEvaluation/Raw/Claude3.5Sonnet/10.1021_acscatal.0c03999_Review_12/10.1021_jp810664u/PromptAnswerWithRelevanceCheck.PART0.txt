[1] "Argyle et al. (4) have suggested that during ethane ODH on vanadium catalysts, the catalyst surface is reduced as lattice oxygen atoms activate ethane molecules, ultimately forming olefins."

[2] "Gas-phase oxygen must then adsorb to a vacancy and reoxidize the active site (reaction 5)."

[3] "When using O2 as the oxidant, increasing the O2 concentration does not lead to an increase in ethylene formation rate because the molybdenum is already fully oxidized. When using N2O as the oxidant, however, an increase in concentration of N2O will increase the rate of catalyst re-oxidation."

[4] "The use of N2O as oxidant makes the activation energy of re-oxidation much closer to the apparent ODH activation energy, which suggests that the rates of catalyst re-oxidation and reduction will be much closer when using N2O as oxidant."

The mechanism of C-H bond activation and catalyst regeneration in oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of alkanes differs between redox-active and redox-inactive metal oxide catalysts. For redox-active catalysts like vanadium oxides, the process follows a Mars-van Krevelen mechanism. The catalyst surface is reduced as lattice oxygen atoms activate alkane molecules to form olefins. The reduced catalyst is then reoxidized by gas-phase oxygen.

Traditional oxidants like O2 rapidly reoxidize the catalyst, keeping it in a highly oxidized state. This can lead to over-oxidation of products. N2O, on the other hand, reoxidizes the catalyst more slowly, allowing it to operate in a more reduced state. This can improve selectivity to desired olefin products.

The effectiveness of catalysts in activating CO2 for ODH of propane varies. While the literature does not directly discuss CO2 activation, it suggests that oxidant choice affects catalyst oxidation state and product selectivity. Catalysts that can effectively dissociate CO2 may provide similar benefits to using N2O, allowing operation in a more reduced state with improved selectivity.

The mechanisms and energy barriers for CO2 dissociation likely differ between catalyst types. Transition metal clusters or ceria may activate CO2 more readily than traditional vanadium oxide catalysts. However, the specific mechanisms and effectiveness of different catalysts for CO2-mediated ODH are not detailed in the provided literature.

烷烃氧化脱氢(ODH)中C-H键活化和催化剂再生的机理在氧化还原活性和非活性金属氧化物催化剂之间有所不同。对于钒氧化物等氧化还原活性催化剂,该过程遵循Mars-van Krevelen机理。催化剂表面被还原,同时晶格氧原子活化烷烃分子形成烯烃。然后还原的催化剂被气相氧再氧化。

O2等传统氧化剂能快速再氧化催化剂,使其保持高度氧化状态。这可能导致产物过度氧化。相比之下,N2O再氧化催化剂的速度较慢,使其在更还原的状态下运行。这可以提高目标烯烃产物的选择性。

催化剂在活化CO2用于丙烷ODH方面的有效性各不相同。虽然文献没有直接讨论CO2的活化,但它表明氧化剂的选择会影响催化剂的氧化状态和产物选择性。能有效解离CO2的催化剂可能提供类似于使用N2O的好处,允许在更还原的状态下运行,从而提高选择性。

CO2解离的机理和能量障碍可能因催化剂类型而异。过渡金属簇或氧化铈可能比传统的钒氧化物催化剂更容易活化CO2。然而,所提供的文献中没有详细介绍不同催化剂在CO2介导的ODH中的具体机理和有效性。

The literature primarily discusses the mechanism of oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of ethane over redox-active metal oxide catalysts, specifically molybdenum-based catalysts. For these catalysts, the Mars-van Krevelen redox mechanism is widely accepted. The process involves:

1. C-H bond activation: Ethane adsorbs to a surface or lattice oxygen atom, followed by C-H bond cleavage to form an ethoxy intermediate and a hydroxyl group on the catalyst surface. This step is considered rate-limiting.

2. Catalyst regeneration: After the formation of ethylene and water, leaving oxygen vacancies, gas-phase oxygen adsorbs to these vacancies to reoxidize the active sites.

The literature compares the use of O2 and N2O as oxidants. With O2, the catalyst remains fully oxidized, and increasing O2 concentration does not affect the ethylene formation rate. With N2O, increasing its concentration increases the rate of catalyst re-oxidation, suggesting that re-oxidation becomes kinetically relevant.

The document does not provide information on redox-inactive catalysts, CO2 as an oxidant, or specific catalysts like V2O5, VOx/SiO2, CeO2, and transition metal clusters for propane ODH. Therefore, a comprehensive comparison of mechanisms for different types of catalysts and oxidants, including CO2, cannot be made based solely on this literature.

这篇文献主要讨论了在氧化还原活性金属氧化物催化剂，特别是基于钼的催化剂上进行乙烷氧化脱氢（ODH）的机理。对于这些催化剂，广泛接受Mars-van Krevelen氧化还原机制。该过程包括：

1. C-H键活化：乙烷吸附在表面或晶格氧原子上，随后C-H键断裂形成乙氧基中间体和催化剂表面的羟基。这一步被认为是速率限制步骤。

2. 催化剂再生：在形成乙烯和水后，留下氧空位，气相氧吸附到这些空位上重新氧化活性位点。

文献比较了使用O2和N2O作为氧化剂的情况。使用O2时，催化剂保持完全氧化状态，增加O2浓度不会影响乙烯的生成速率。使用N2O时，增加其浓度会增加催化剂再氧化的速率，表明再氧化在动力学上变得相关。

该文献没有提供关于氧化还原非活性催化剂、CO2作为氧化剂，或特定催化剂如V2O5、VOx/SiO2、CeO2和过渡金属簇用于丙烷ODH的信息。因此，仅基于这篇文献无法对不同类型的催化剂和氧化剂（包括CO2）的机理进行全面比较。

The provided literature does not contain sufficient information to fully compare and contrast the mechanisms of C-H bond activation and catalyst regeneration for redox-active and redox-inactive metal oxide catalysts in oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of alkanes. The text also does not discuss the use of CO2 as an oxidant or its activation by different catalysts for propane ODH.

However, based on the available information, we can discuss some aspects of the ODH mechanism for redox-active catalysts:

1. Redox-active catalysts: The text mentions vanadium and molybdenum as commonly used active metals for low-temperature ODH of lower alkanes. These are typically redox-active catalysts.

2. Mars-van Krevelen mechanism: For easily reducible transition metal oxides (redox-active catalysts), the ODH reaction proceeds via a Mars-van Krevelen redox mechanism.

3. C-H bond activation: The initial step involves ethane adsorption on a surface or lattice oxygen atom, followed by C-H bond cleavage to form an ethoxy intermediate and a hydroxyl group on the catalyst surface. This C-H bond cleavage is considered the rate-limiting step.

4. Catalyst regeneration: After the formation of the product (e.g., ethylene) and water, gas-phase oxygen adsorbs to the vacancy created on the catalyst surface and reoxidizes the active site.

5. Oxidant effects: The study compares O2 and N2O as oxidants. With O2, the catalyst remains fully oxidized, and increasing O2 concentration does not affect the ethylene formation rate. With N2O, increasing its concentration leads to a higher rate of catalyst re-oxidation, suggesting that the re-oxidation step becomes kinetically relevant.

The literature does not provide information on redox-inactive catalysts, the use of CO2 as an oxidant, or the effectiveness of different catalysts (V2O5, VOx/SiO2, CeO2, and transition metal clusters) in activating CO2 for propane ODH. Therefore, these aspects of the question cannot be addressed based on the given information.

根据提供的文献，我们无法全面比较和对比氧化脱氢(ODH)反应中氧化还原活性和非活性金属氧化物催化剂的C-H键活化和催化剂再生机理。文本也没有讨论CO2作为氧化剂的使用，或不同催化剂在丙烷ODH中活化CO2的效果。

然而，基于可用信息，我们可以讨论氧化还原活性催化剂ODH机理的一些方面：

1. 氧化还原活性催化剂：文本提到钒和钼是低温下烷烃ODH常用的活性金属。这些通常是氧化还原活性催化剂。

2. Mars-van Krevelen机理：对于易还原的过渡金属氧化物（氧化还原活性催化剂），ODH反应通过Mars-van Krevelen氧化还原机理进行。

3. C-H键活化：初始步骤涉及乙烷在表面或晶格氧原子上的吸附，随后C-H键断裂形成乙氧基中间体和催化剂表面的羟基。这个C-H键断裂被认为是速率限制步骤。

4. 催化剂再生：在产物（如乙烯）和水形成后，气相氧吸附到催化剂表面产生的空位上并重新氧化活性位点。

5. 氧化剂效应：研究比较了O2和N2O作为氧化剂。使用O2时，催化剂保持完全氧化状态，增加O2浓度不影响乙烯形成速率。使用N2O时，增加其浓度会导致催化剂再氧化速率更高，表明再氧化步骤在动力学上变得相关。

文献没有提供关于氧化还原非活性催化剂、CO2作为氧化剂的使用，或不同催化剂（V2O5、VOx/SiO2、CeO2和过渡金属簇）在活化CO2用于丙烷ODH方面的效果信息。因此，基于给定信息无法讨论这些问题的方面。

The mechanisms of C-H bond activation and catalyst regeneration in oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of alkanes differ between redox-active and redox-inactive metal oxide catalysts. 

For redox-active catalysts like vanadium and molybdenum oxides, the Mars-van Krevelen mechanism is widely accepted. In this process, lattice oxygen atoms from the catalyst activate the C-H bonds of alkanes, forming olefins and reducing the catalyst surface. The catalyst is then regenerated by the oxidant.

The effectiveness of the catalyst depends on its oxidation state. A more oxidized catalyst has more reactive lattice oxygen atoms available for C-H activation. However, this can also lead to over-oxidation of the desired products.

Traditional oxidants like O2 are very effective at regenerating the catalyst. The study shows that when using O2, the molybdenum catalyst remains fully oxidized (Mo(VI)). In contrast, when using N2O as an oxidant, the catalyst operates in a more reduced state (mixture of Mo(VI), Mo(V), and Mo(IV)). This difference in oxidation state affects the selectivity and activity of the catalyst.

The literature does not provide information on redox-inactive catalysts or the use of CO2 as an oxidant for ODH. It also doesn't discuss the effectiveness of different catalysts like V2O5, VOx/SiO2, CeO2, or transition metal clusters in activating CO2 for ODH of propane. The mechanisms and energy barriers for CO2 dissociation are not mentioned in the given text.

烷烃氧化脱氢（ODH）过程中C-H键活化和催化剂再生的机理在氧化还原活性和非活性金属氧化物催化剂之间存在差异。

对于钒和钼氧化物等氧化还原活性催化剂，普遍接受Mars-van Krevelen机理。在这个过程中，催化剂的晶格氧原子活化烷烃的C-H键，形成烯烃并还原催化剂表面。然后催化剂被氧化剂再生。

催化剂的效果取决于其氧化状态。更氧化的催化剂有更多的反应性晶格氧原子可用于C-H活化。然而，这也可能导致目标产物的过度氧化。

传统氧化剂如O2在催化剂再生方面非常有效。研究表明，使用O2时，钼催化剂保持完全氧化状态（Mo(VI)）。相比之下，使用N2O作为氧化剂时，催化剂在更还原的状态下运行（Mo(VI)、Mo(V)和Mo(IV)的混合物）。这种氧化状态的差异影响了催化剂的选择性和活性。

文献中没有提供关于氧化还原非活性催化剂或使用CO2作为ODH氧化剂的信息。它也没有讨论V2O5、VOx/SiO2、CeO2或过渡金属簇等不同催化剂在活化CO2用于丙烷ODH方面的效果。给定的文本中没有提到CO2解离的机理和能量障碍。

For redox-active catalysts like vanadium oxides, the Mars-van Krevelen mechanism is typically observed.

The catalyst is then regenerated by gas-phase oxidants like O2 or N2O.

Traditional oxidants like O2 are generally more effective at regenerating the catalyst compared to alternatives like N2O. O2 can rapidly reoxidize the catalyst even at low concentrations, while N2O shows a concentration-dependent effect on reoxidation rates. The activation energy for reoxidation with N2O is significantly higher than with O2, explaining why O2 can oxidize catalysts at lower temperatures.

Regarding CO2 as an oxidant for propane ODH, the literature provided does not contain specific information about its effectiveness or mechanisms with different catalysts like V2O5, VOx/SiO2, CeO2, or transition metal clusters. To properly discuss CO2 activation and its use in propane ODH would require additional sources beyond the given text.
