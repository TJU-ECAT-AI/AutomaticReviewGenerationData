[1] "Argyle et al. (4) have suggested that during ethane ODH on vanadium catalysts, the catalyst surface is reduced as lattice oxygen atoms activate ethane molecules, ultimately forming olefins."

[2] "Gas-phase oxygen must then adsorb to a vacancy and reoxidize the active site (reaction 5)."

[3] "When using O2 as the oxidant, increasing the O2 concentration does not lead to an increase in ethylene formation rate because the molybdenum is already fully oxidized. When using N2O as the oxidant, however, an increase in concentration of N2O will increase the rate of catalyst re-oxidation."

[4] "The use of N2O as oxidant makes the activation energy of re-oxidation much closer to the apparent ODH activation energy, which suggests that the rates of catalyst re-oxidation and reduction will be much closer when using N2O as oxidant."

The mechanism of C-H bond activation and catalyst regeneration in oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of alkanes differs between redox-active and redox-inactive metal oxide catalysts. For redox-active catalysts like vanadium oxides, the process follows a Mars-van Krevelen mechanism. The catalyst surface is reduced as lattice oxygen atoms activate alkane molecules to form olefins. The reduced catalyst is then reoxidized by gas-phase oxygen.

Traditional oxidants like O2 rapidly reoxidize the catalyst, keeping it in a highly oxidized state. This can lead to over-oxidation of products. N2O, on the other hand, reoxidizes the catalyst more slowly, allowing it to operate in a more reduced state. This can improve selectivity to desired olefin products.

The effectiveness of catalysts in activating CO2 for ODH of propane varies. While the literature does not directly discuss CO2 activation, it suggests that oxidant choice affects catalyst oxidation state and product selectivity. Catalysts that can effectively dissociate CO2 may provide similar benefits to using N2O, allowing operation in a more reduced state with improved selectivity.

The mechanisms and energy barriers for CO2 dissociation likely differ between catalyst types. Transition metal clusters or ceria may activate CO2 more readily than traditional vanadium oxide catalysts. However, the specific mechanisms and effectiveness of different catalysts for CO2-mediated ODH are not detailed in the provided literature.

烷烃氧化脱氢(ODH)中C-H键活化和催化剂再生的机理在氧化还原活性和非活性金属氧化物催化剂之间有所不同。对于钒氧化物等氧化还原活性催化剂,该过程遵循Mars-van Krevelen机理。催化剂表面被还原,同时晶格氧原子活化烷烃分子形成烯烃。然后还原的催化剂被气相氧再氧化。

O2等传统氧化剂能快速再氧化催化剂,使其保持高度氧化状态。这可能导致产物过度氧化。相比之下,N2O再氧化催化剂的速度较慢,使其在更还原的状态下运行。这可以提高目标烯烃产物的选择性。

催化剂在活化CO2用于丙烷ODH方面的有效性各不相同。虽然文献没有直接讨论CO2的活化,但它表明氧化剂的选择会影响催化剂的氧化状态和产物选择性。能有效解离CO2的催化剂可能提供类似于使用N2O的好处,允许在更还原的状态下运行,从而提高选择性。

CO2解离的机理和能量障碍可能因催化剂类型而异。过渡金属簇或氧化铈可能比传统的钒氧化物催化剂更容易活化CO2。然而,所提供的文献中没有详细介绍不同催化剂在CO2介导的ODH中的具体机理和有效性。
