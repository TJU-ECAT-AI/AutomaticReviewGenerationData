[1] "It is widely accepted that the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane over easily reducible transition metal oxides proceeds via a Mars–van Krevelen redox mechanism."

[2] "Ethane must first adsorb (reaction 1) to a surface or lattice oxygen atom (O*), and a C–H bond must be cleaved forming an ethoxy intermediate and a hydroxyl group on the catalyst surface (reaction 2). This initial cleavage of the ethane C–H bond is considered the rate-limiting step"

[3] "Gas-phase oxygen must then adsorb to a vacancy and reoxidize the active site (reaction 5)."

[4] "When using O2 as the oxidant, increasing the O2 concentration does not lead to an increase in ethylene formation rate because the molybdenum is already fully oxidized. When using N2O as the oxidant, however, an increase in concentration of N2O will increase the rate of catalyst re-oxidation."

[5] "The use of N2O as oxidant makes the activation energy of re-oxidation much closer to the apparent ODH activation energy, which suggests that the rates of catalyst re-oxidation and reduction will be much closer when using N2O as oxidant."

The literature primarily discusses the mechanism of oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of ethane over redox-active metal oxide catalysts, specifically molybdenum-based catalysts. For these catalysts, the Mars-van Krevelen redox mechanism is widely accepted. The process involves:

1. C-H bond activation: Ethane adsorbs to a surface or lattice oxygen atom, followed by C-H bond cleavage to form an ethoxy intermediate and a hydroxyl group on the catalyst surface. This step is considered rate-limiting.

2. Catalyst regeneration: After the formation of ethylene and water, leaving oxygen vacancies, gas-phase oxygen adsorbs to these vacancies to reoxidize the active sites.

The literature compares the use of O2 and N2O as oxidants. With O2, the catalyst remains fully oxidized, and increasing O2 concentration does not affect the ethylene formation rate. With N2O, increasing its concentration increases the rate of catalyst re-oxidation, suggesting that re-oxidation becomes kinetically relevant.

The document does not provide information on redox-inactive catalysts, CO2 as an oxidant, or specific catalysts like V2O5, VOx/SiO2, CeO2, and transition metal clusters for propane ODH. Therefore, a comprehensive comparison of mechanisms for different types of catalysts and oxidants, including CO2, cannot be made based solely on this literature.

这篇文献主要讨论了在氧化还原活性金属氧化物催化剂，特别是基于钼的催化剂上进行乙烷氧化脱氢（ODH）的机理。对于这些催化剂，广泛接受Mars-van Krevelen氧化还原机制。该过程包括：

1. C-H键活化：乙烷吸附在表面或晶格氧原子上，随后C-H键断裂形成乙氧基中间体和催化剂表面的羟基。这一步被认为是速率限制步骤。

2. 催化剂再生：在形成乙烯和水后，留下氧空位，气相氧吸附到这些空位上重新氧化活性位点。

文献比较了使用O2和N2O作为氧化剂的情况。使用O2时，催化剂保持完全氧化状态，增加O2浓度不会影响乙烯的生成速率。使用N2O时，增加其浓度会增加催化剂再氧化的速率，表明再氧化在动力学上变得相关。

该文献没有提供关于氧化还原非活性催化剂、CO2作为氧化剂，或特定催化剂如V2O5、VOx/SiO2、CeO2和过渡金属簇用于丙烷ODH的信息。因此，仅基于这篇文献无法对不同类型的催化剂和氧化剂（包括CO2）的机理进行全面比较。
