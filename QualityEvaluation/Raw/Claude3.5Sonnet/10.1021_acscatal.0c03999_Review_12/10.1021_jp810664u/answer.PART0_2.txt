[1] "Vanadium and molybdenum are the most often used active metals for low-temperature ODH of lower alkanes."

[2] "Previous research has shown that a mixed oxide solgel catalyst containing 10 wt% molybdenum and silica and titania at a 1:1 molar ratio is quite active and selective for the oxidative dehydrogenation of lower alkanes"

[3] "It is widely accepted that the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane over easily reducible transition metal oxides proceeds via a Marsvan-Krevelen redox mechanism."

[4] "Ethane must first adsorb (reaction 1) to a surface or lattice oxygen atom (O*), and a CH bond must be cleaved forming an ethoxy intermediate and a hydroxyl group on the catalyst surface (reaction 2). This initial cleavage of the ethane CH bond is considered the rate-limiting step"

[5] "Gas-phase oxygen must then adsorb to a vacancy and reoxidize the active site (reaction 5)."

[6] "When using O2 as the oxidant, increasing the O2 concentration does not lead to an increase in ethylene formation rate because the molybdenum is already fully oxidized. When using N2O as the oxidant, however, an increase in concentration of N2O will increase the rate of catalyst re-oxidation."

The provided literature does not contain sufficient information to fully compare and contrast the mechanisms of C-H bond activation and catalyst regeneration for redox-active and redox-inactive metal oxide catalysts in oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of alkanes. The text also does not discuss the use of CO2 as an oxidant or its activation by different catalysts for propane ODH.

However, based on the available information, we can discuss some aspects of the ODH mechanism for redox-active catalysts:

1. Redox-active catalysts: The text mentions vanadium and molybdenum as commonly used active metals for low-temperature ODH of lower alkanes. These are typically redox-active catalysts.

2. Mars-van Krevelen mechanism: For easily reducible transition metal oxides (redox-active catalysts), the ODH reaction proceeds via a Mars-van Krevelen redox mechanism.

3. C-H bond activation: The initial step involves ethane adsorption on a surface or lattice oxygen atom, followed by C-H bond cleavage to form an ethoxy intermediate and a hydroxyl group on the catalyst surface. This C-H bond cleavage is considered the rate-limiting step.

4. Catalyst regeneration: After the formation of the product (e.g., ethylene) and water, gas-phase oxygen adsorbs to the vacancy created on the catalyst surface and reoxidizes the active site.

5. Oxidant effects: The study compares O2 and N2O as oxidants. With O2, the catalyst remains fully oxidized, and increasing O2 concentration does not affect the ethylene formation rate. With N2O, increasing its concentration leads to a higher rate of catalyst re-oxidation, suggesting that the re-oxidation step becomes kinetically relevant.

The literature does not provide information on redox-inactive catalysts, the use of CO2 as an oxidant, or the effectiveness of different catalysts (V2O5, VOx/SiO2, CeO2, and transition metal clusters) in activating CO2 for propane ODH. Therefore, these aspects of the question cannot be addressed based on the given information.

根据提供的文献，我们无法全面比较和对比氧化脱氢(ODH)反应中氧化还原活性和非活性金属氧化物催化剂的C-H键活化和催化剂再生机理。文本也没有讨论CO2作为氧化剂的使用，或不同催化剂在丙烷ODH中活化CO2的效果。

然而，基于可用信息，我们可以讨论氧化还原活性催化剂ODH机理的一些方面：

1. 氧化还原活性催化剂：文本提到钒和钼是低温下烷烃ODH常用的活性金属。这些通常是氧化还原活性催化剂。

2. Mars-van Krevelen机理：对于易还原的过渡金属氧化物（氧化还原活性催化剂），ODH反应通过Mars-van Krevelen氧化还原机理进行。

3. C-H键活化：初始步骤涉及乙烷在表面或晶格氧原子上的吸附，随后C-H键断裂形成乙氧基中间体和催化剂表面的羟基。这个C-H键断裂被认为是速率限制步骤。

4. 催化剂再生：在产物（如乙烯）和水形成后，气相氧吸附到催化剂表面产生的空位上并重新氧化活性位点。

5. 氧化剂效应：研究比较了O2和N2O作为氧化剂。使用O2时，催化剂保持完全氧化状态，增加O2浓度不影响乙烯形成速率。使用N2O时，增加其浓度会导致催化剂再氧化速率更高，表明再氧化步骤在动力学上变得相关。

文献没有提供关于氧化还原非活性催化剂、CO2作为氧化剂的使用，或不同催化剂（V2O5、VOx/SiO2、CeO2和过渡金属簇）在活化CO2用于丙烷ODH方面的效果信息。因此，基于给定信息无法讨论这些问题的方面。
