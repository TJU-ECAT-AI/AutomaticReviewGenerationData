[1] "Argyle et al. (4) have suggested that during ethane ODH on vanadium catalysts, the catalyst surface is reduced as lattice oxygen atoms activate ethane molecules, ultimately forming olefins."

[2] "Gas-phase oxygen must then adsorb to a vacancy and reoxidize the active site (reaction 5)."

[3] "When using O2 as the oxidant, increasing the O2 concentration does not lead to an increase in ethylene formation rate because the molybdenum is already fully oxidized. When using N2O as the oxidant, however, an increase in concentration of N2O will increase the rate of catalyst re-oxidation."

[4] "The activation energy of re-oxidation when using N2O is 2.4 times higher than that required when using O2. This difference likely accounts for the ability of O2 to oxidize the reduced sample at lower temperatures than N2O."

The mechanisms of C-H bond activation and catalyst regeneration in oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of alkanes differ between redox-active and redox-inactive metal oxide catalysts. For redox-active catalysts like vanadium oxides, the Mars-van Krevelen mechanism is typically observed. In this process, lattice oxygen atoms from the catalyst activate the C-H bonds in alkanes, resulting in the reduction of the catalyst surface. The catalyst is then regenerated by gas-phase oxidants like O2 or N2O.

Traditional oxidants like O2 are generally more effective at regenerating the catalyst compared to alternatives like N2O. O2 can rapidly reoxidize the catalyst even at low concentrations, while N2O shows a concentration-dependent effect on reoxidation rates. The activation energy for reoxidation with N2O is significantly higher than with O2, explaining why O2 can oxidize catalysts at lower temperatures.

Regarding CO2 as an oxidant for propane ODH, the literature provided does not contain specific information about its effectiveness or mechanisms with different catalysts like V2O5, VOx/SiO2, CeO2, or transition metal clusters. To properly discuss CO2 activation and its use in propane ODH would require additional sources beyond the given text.

烷烃氧化脱氢(ODH)中C-H键活化和催化剂再生的机理在氧化还原活性和非活性金属氧化物催化剂之间存在差异。对于像钒氧化物这样的氧化还原活性催化剂，通常观察到Mars-van Krevelen机理。在这个过程中，催化剂中的晶格氧原子活化烷烃中的C-H键，导致催化剂表面被还原。然后催化剂通过气相氧化剂如O2或N2O再生。

传统氧化剂如O2通常比N2O等替代品更有效地再生催化剂。O2即使在低浓度下也能快速重新氧化催化剂，而N2O的再氧化速率则显示出浓度依赖性。用N2O再氧化的活化能明显高于O2，这解释了为什么O2能在较低温度下氧化催化剂。

关于CO2作为丙烷ODH的氧化剂，所提供的文献并不包含关于它在不同催化剂（如V2O5、VOx/SiO2、CeO2或过渡金属簇）上的效果或机理的具体信息。要正确讨论CO2的活化及其在丙烷ODH中的应用，需要超出给定文本的额外资料。
