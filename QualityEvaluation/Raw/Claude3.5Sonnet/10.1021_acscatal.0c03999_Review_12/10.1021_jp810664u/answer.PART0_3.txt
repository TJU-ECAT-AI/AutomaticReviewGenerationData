[1] "Vanadium and molybdenum are the most often used active metals for low-temperature ODH of lower alkanes."

[2] "Clearly, the working oxidation state of the catalyst is different when performing ODH with O2 or N2O. It is widely accepted that the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane over easily reducible transition metal oxides proceeds via a Mars–van Krevelen redox mechanism."

[3] "Argyle et al. (4) have suggested that during ethane ODH on vanadium catalysts, the catalyst surface is reduced as lattice oxygen atoms activate ethane molecules, ultimately forming olefins."

[4] "Changes in oxidation state could account for the behavior observed in Figure 2. During ODH, a catalyst in a more oxidized state would have a greater number of reactive lattice oxygen atoms."

[5] "The XPS results indicate that molybdenum is in a lower oxidation state in the post-N2O oxidative dehydrogenation sample. The post-N2O sample contained Mo(VI), Mo(V), and Mo(IV), whereas the post-O2 sample appeared fully oxidized with only Mo(VI) appearing."

The mechanisms of C-H bond activation and catalyst regeneration in oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of alkanes differ between redox-active and redox-inactive metal oxide catalysts. 

For redox-active catalysts like vanadium and molybdenum oxides, the Mars-van Krevelen mechanism is widely accepted. In this process, lattice oxygen atoms from the catalyst activate the C-H bonds of alkanes, forming olefins and reducing the catalyst surface. The catalyst is then regenerated by the oxidant.

The effectiveness of the catalyst depends on its oxidation state. A more oxidized catalyst has more reactive lattice oxygen atoms available for C-H activation. However, this can also lead to over-oxidation of the desired products.

Traditional oxidants like O2 are very effective at regenerating the catalyst. The study shows that when using O2, the molybdenum catalyst remains fully oxidized (Mo(VI)). In contrast, when using N2O as an oxidant, the catalyst operates in a more reduced state (mixture of Mo(VI), Mo(V), and Mo(IV)). This difference in oxidation state affects the selectivity and activity of the catalyst.

The literature does not provide information on redox-inactive catalysts or the use of CO2 as an oxidant for ODH. It also doesn't discuss the effectiveness of different catalysts like V2O5, VOx/SiO2, CeO2, or transition metal clusters in activating CO2 for ODH of propane. The mechanisms and energy barriers for CO2 dissociation are not mentioned in the given text.

烷烃氧化脱氢（ODH）过程中C-H键活化和催化剂再生的机理在氧化还原活性和非活性金属氧化物催化剂之间存在差异。

对于钒和钼氧化物等氧化还原活性催化剂，普遍接受Mars-van Krevelen机理。在这个过程中，催化剂的晶格氧原子活化烷烃的C-H键，形成烯烃并还原催化剂表面。然后催化剂被氧化剂再生。

催化剂的效果取决于其氧化状态。更氧化的催化剂有更多的反应性晶格氧原子可用于C-H活化。然而，这也可能导致目标产物的过度氧化。

传统氧化剂如O2在催化剂再生方面非常有效。研究表明，使用O2时，钼催化剂保持完全氧化状态（Mo(VI)）。相比之下，使用N2O作为氧化剂时，催化剂在更还原的状态下运行（Mo(VI)、Mo(V)和Mo(IV)的混合物）。这种氧化状态的差异影响了催化剂的选择性和活性。

文献中没有提供关于氧化还原非活性催化剂或使用CO2作为ODH氧化剂的信息。它也没有讨论V2O5、VOx/SiO2、CeO2或过渡金属簇等不同催化剂在活化CO2用于丙烷ODH方面的效果。给定的文本中没有提到CO2解离的机理和能量障碍。
