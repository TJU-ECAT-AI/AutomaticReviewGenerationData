"CO2 has the ability to oxidize V2O3 to V2O4 and participates in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propylene."

"When using chromium or vanadium oxide based catalysts, CO2 can re-oxidize partially reduced metal oxides. It is generally accepted that it follows a proposed pathway which is in agreement with the Mars-Van Krevelen mechanism"

"For gallium and indium based catalysts, the promoting effect of CO2 is related to its enhancing effect on the removal of coke, the Boudouard reaction, and the reverse water gas shift (RWGS) reaction."

"According to the DFT-calculated Gibbs free energy profile at 600 C, the activation of the secondary CAH bond of propane (EDFT,act = 158 kJ/mol) is rate-limiting, while re-oxidation of the catalyst with CO2 is potentially much faster."

"CO2-assisted propane dehydrogenation results in a higher selectivity toward propylene production and a reduction of carbon formation."

"When the catalyst is reduced, and subsequently re-oxidized with CO2 instead of O2 at the same temperature, the H2 consumption peak is about 0.86 ± 0.13 mol/molVOx which is 45 ± 7% of that of the samples that have been oxidized by O2. This clearly indicates that less than half of the exchangeable oxygen is regenerated by CO2, which can be attributed to the oxidation of V2O3 into V2O4 instead of V2O5."

The mechanisms of C-H bond activation and catalyst regeneration differ between redox-active and redox-inactive metal oxide catalysts in the oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of alkanes.

For redox-active catalysts like V2O5 and VOx/SiO2, the Mars-Van Krevelen mechanism is generally accepted. In this mechanism, lattice oxygen from the metal oxide participates in C-H bond activation, forming water and reducing the metal oxide. The catalyst is then regenerated by re-oxidation with an oxidant.

Traditional oxidants like O2 can fully re-oxidize these catalysts, but CO2 acts as a milder oxidant. For vanadium-based catalysts, CO2 can oxidize V2O3 to V2O4, but not to V2O5. This partial re-oxidation leads to higher selectivity towards propylene and reduced carbon formation compared to using O2.

For redox-inactive catalysts like CeO2, the mechanism likely involves surface-adsorbed oxygen species rather than lattice oxygen. These catalysts may activate CO2 differently, potentially through the formation of carbonate species on the surface.

The effectiveness of different catalysts in activating CO2 for ODH of propane varies:

1. Vanadium-based catalysts (V2O5, VOx/SiO2) show good activity, with CO2 re-oxidizing the partially reduced metal oxide.
2. Chromium-based catalysts also demonstrate the ability to be re-oxidized by CO2.
3. Gallium and indium-based catalysts utilize CO2 differently, promoting coke removal and participating in the reverse water gas shift reaction.
4. Transition metal clusters may activate CO2 through different mechanisms, but specific information is not provided in the given text.

DFT calculations for VOx/SiO2 catalysts suggest that the rate-limiting step is the activation of the secondary C-H bond of propane (activation energy of 158 kJ/mol), while the re-oxidation of the catalyst with CO2 is faster. This implies that CO2 activation is not the limiting factor for this particular catalyst system.

In summary, the effectiveness of catalysts in activating CO2 for ODH of propane depends on their ability to facilitate CO2 dissociation and incorporate the resulting oxygen into the catalyst structure or reaction mechanism. The specific mechanisms and energy barriers vary among different catalyst types, with redox-active metal oxides showing promising results in CO2-assisted ODH of propane.

在烷烃的氧化脱氢(ODH)反应中，氧化还原活性和非氧化还原活性金属氧化物催化剂的C-H键活化和催化剂再生机理存在差异。

对于V2O5和VOx/SiO2等氧化还原活性催化剂，普遍接受Mars-Van Krevelen机理。在这个机理中，金属氧化物的晶格氧参与C-H键的活化，形成水并还原金属氧化物。然后催化剂通过氧化剂再氧化而再生。

传统的氧化剂如O2可以完全再氧化这些催化剂，但CO2作为一种较温和的氧化剂。对于钒基催化剂，CO2可以将V2O3氧化到V2O4，但不能氧化到V2O5。与使用O2相比，这种部分再氧化导致了更高的丙烯选择性和更少的碳沉积。

对于CeO2等非氧化还原活性催化剂，其机理可能涉及表面吸附氧物种而不是晶格氧。这些催化剂可能以不同方式活化CO2，可能通过在表面形成碳酸盐物种。

不同催化剂在活化CO2用于丙烷ODH反应的效果各不相同：

1. 钒基催化剂(V2O5, VOx/SiO2)显示出良好的活性，CO2可以再氧化部分还原的金属氧化物。
2. 铬基催化剂也表现出可以被CO2再氧化的能力。
3. 镓和铟基催化剂以不同方式利用CO2，促进焦炭去除并参与逆水气变换反应。
4. 过渡金属簇可能通过不同的机理活化CO2，但给定文本中没有提供具体信息。

对于VOx/SiO2催化剂，DFT计算表明，限速步骤是丙烷二级C-H键的活化(活化能为158 kJ/mol)，而催化剂被CO2再氧化的过程更快。这意味着对于这个特定的催化剂体系，CO2的活化不是限制因素。

总之，催化剂在活化CO2用于丙烷ODH反应的效果取决于它们促进CO2解离并将所得氧并入催化剂结构或反应机理的能力。不同类型催化剂的具体机理和能量障碍各不相同，其中氧化还原活性金属氧化物在CO2辅助的丙烷ODH反应中显示出有前景的结果。
