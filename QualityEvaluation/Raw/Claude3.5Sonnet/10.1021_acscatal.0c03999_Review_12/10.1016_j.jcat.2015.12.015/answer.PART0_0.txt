The mechanisms of C-H bond activation and catalyst regeneration differ between redox-active and redox-inactive metal oxide catalysts in the oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes.

For redox-active catalysts like V2O5 and VOx/SiO2, the Mars-Van Krevelen mechanism is generally accepted. In this mechanism, lattice oxygen from the metal oxide participates in the C-H bond activation, forming the desired alkene and reducing the metal oxide. The catalyst is then regenerated by the oxidant, which in traditional ODH is typically O2. 

When using CO2 as an oxidant with vanadium-based catalysts, it can re-oxidize partially reduced metal oxides, specifically oxidizing V2O3 to V2O4. This allows CO2 to participate in the oxidative dehydrogenation cycle, albeit with a lower oxidation potential compared to O2. The DFT calculations suggest that while C-H bond activation remains the rate-limiting step, catalyst re-oxidation by CO2 is relatively fast.

For redox-inactive catalysts like CeO2, the mechanism is different. These catalysts typically activate C-H bonds through surface oxygen species or defect sites, rather than lattice oxygen. The role of CO2 with these catalysts is more focused on coke removal, participating in the Boudouard reaction, and promoting the reverse water gas shift (RWGS) reaction.

Regarding the effectiveness of different catalysts in activating CO2 for ODH of propane:

1. V2O5 and VOx/SiO2: These are effective in utilizing CO2, as they can be partially re-oxidized by CO2, allowing it to participate directly in the ODH cycle.

2. CeO2: While not explicitly mentioned in the text, CeO2 is known to activate CO2, but its role is likely more focused on coke removal and RWGS rather than direct participation in the ODH cycle.

3. Ga2O3 and In2O3: These catalysts effectively use CO2 for coke removal and RWGS, indirectly promoting ODH by shifting equilibrium and maintaining catalyst activity.

4. Transition metal clusters: The text doesn't provide specific information on these.

The use of CO2 as an oxidant generally results in higher selectivity towards propylene and reduced carbon formation compared to traditional oxidants. However, the energy barriers for CO2 dissociation are not explicitly provided in the text, making it difficult to compare the effectiveness of CO2 activation across different catalysts.

In summary, while traditional oxidants like O2 can fully re-oxidize catalysts, CO2 acts as a milder oxidant. Its effectiveness and mechanism of action vary depending on the catalyst type, ranging from direct participation in the ODH cycle for redox-active catalysts to indirect promotion through coke removal and equilibrium shifting for redox-inactive catalysts.

在烷烃氧化脱氢过程中，氧化还原活性和非氧化还原活性金属氧化物催化剂的C-H键活化和催化剂再生机理存在差异。

对于V2O5和VOx/SiO2等氧化还原活性催化剂，普遍接受Mars-Van Krevelen机理。在此机理中，金属氧化物的晶格氧参与C-H键活化，形成所需的烯烃并还原金属氧化物。然后，催化剂通过氧化剂再生，在传统ODH中通常是O2。

当使用CO2作为钒基催化剂的氧化剂时，它可以重新氧化部分还原的金属氧化物，特别是将V2O3氧化为V2O4。这使得CO2可以参与氧化脱氢循环，尽管与O2相比氧化能力较低。DFT计算表明，虽然C-H键活化仍然是速率限制步骤，但CO2对催化剂的再氧化相对较快。

对于CeO2等非氧化还原活性催化剂，机理不同。这些催化剂通常通过表面氧物种或缺陷位点活化C-H键，而不是通过晶格氧。CO2在这些催化剂中的作用更多地集中在焦炭去除、参与Boudouard反应和促进逆水气变换（RWGS）反应。

关于不同催化剂在活化CO2用于丙烷ODH的有效性：

1. V2O5和VOx/SiO2：这些催化剂有效利用CO2，因为它们可以被CO2部分再氧化，使其直接参与ODH循环。

2. CeO2：虽然文本中没有明确提到，但已知CeO2可以活化CO2，但其作用可能更多地集中在焦炭去除和RWGS上，而不是直接参与ODH循环。

3. Ga2O3和In2O3：这些催化剂有效地利用CO2进行焦炭去除和RWGS，通过移动平衡和维持催化剂活性间接促进ODH。

4. 过渡金属簇：文本没有提供关于这些的具体信息。

使用CO2作为氧化剂通常会导致更高的丙烯选择性和较低的碳生成，相比传统氧化剂。然而，文本中没有明确提供CO2解离的能量障碍，因此难以比较CO2在不同催化剂上的活化效率。

总之，虽然O2等传统氧化剂可以完全再氧化催化剂，但CO2作为一种较温和的氧化剂。其有效性和作用机制因催化剂类型而异，对于氧化还原活性催化剂，它直接参与ODH循环；对于非氧化还原活性催化剂，它通过焦炭去除和平衡移动间接促进反应。
