The mechanisms of C-H bond activation and catalyst regeneration differ between redox-active and redox-inactive metal oxide catalysts in the oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes.

For redox-active catalysts like V2O5 and VOx/SiO2, the Mars-Van Krevelen mechanism is generally accepted. In this mechanism, lattice oxygen from the metal oxide participates in the C-H bond activation, forming the desired alkene and reducing the metal oxide. The catalyst is then regenerated by the oxidant, which in traditional ODH is typically O2. 

When using CO2 as an oxidant with vanadium-based catalysts, it can re-oxidize partially reduced metal oxides, specifically oxidizing V2O3 to V2O4. This allows CO2 to participate in the oxidative dehydrogenation cycle, albeit with a lower oxidation potential compared to O2. The DFT calculations suggest that while C-H bond activation remains the rate-limiting step, catalyst re-oxidation by CO2 is relatively fast.

For redox-inactive catalysts like CeO2, the mechanism is different. These catalysts typically activate C-H bonds through surface oxygen species or defect sites, rather than lattice oxygen. The role of CO2 with these catalysts is more focused on coke removal, participating in the Boudouard reaction, and promoting the reverse water gas shift (RWGS) reaction.

Regarding the effectiveness of different catalysts in activating CO2 for ODH of propane:

1. V2O5 and VOx/SiO2: These are effective in utilizing CO2, as they can be partially re-oxidized by CO2, allowing it to participate directly in the ODH cycle.

2. CeO2: While not explicitly mentioned in the text, CeO2 is known to activate CO2, but its role is likely more focused on coke removal and RWGS rather than direct participation in the ODH cycle.

3. Ga2O3 and In2O3: These catalysts effectively use CO2 for coke removal and RWGS, indirectly promoting ODH by shifting equilibrium and maintaining catalyst activity.

4. Transition metal clusters: The text doesn't provide specific information on these.

The use of CO2 as an oxidant generally results in higher selectivity towards propylene and reduced carbon formation compared to traditional oxidants. However, the energy barriers for CO2 dissociation are not explicitly provided in the text, making it difficult to compare the effectiveness of CO2 activation across different catalysts.

In summary, while traditional oxidants like O2 can fully re-oxidize catalysts, CO2 acts as a milder oxidant. Its effectiveness and mechanism of action vary depending on the catalyst type, ranging from direct participation in the ODH cycle for redox-active catalysts to indirect promotion through coke removal and equilibrium shifting for redox-inactive catalysts.

在烷烃氧化脱氢过程中，氧化还原活性和非氧化还原活性金属氧化物催化剂的C-H键活化和催化剂再生机理存在差异。

对于V2O5和VOx/SiO2等氧化还原活性催化剂，普遍接受Mars-Van Krevelen机理。在此机理中，金属氧化物的晶格氧参与C-H键活化，形成所需的烯烃并还原金属氧化物。然后，催化剂通过氧化剂再生，在传统ODH中通常是O2。

当使用CO2作为钒基催化剂的氧化剂时，它可以重新氧化部分还原的金属氧化物，特别是将V2O3氧化为V2O4。这使得CO2可以参与氧化脱氢循环，尽管与O2相比氧化能力较低。DFT计算表明，虽然C-H键活化仍然是速率限制步骤，但CO2对催化剂的再氧化相对较快。

对于CeO2等非氧化还原活性催化剂，机理不同。这些催化剂通常通过表面氧物种或缺陷位点活化C-H键，而不是通过晶格氧。CO2在这些催化剂中的作用更多地集中在焦炭去除、参与Boudouard反应和促进逆水气变换（RWGS）反应。

关于不同催化剂在活化CO2用于丙烷ODH的有效性：

1. V2O5和VOx/SiO2：这些催化剂有效利用CO2，因为它们可以被CO2部分再氧化，使其直接参与ODH循环。

2. CeO2：虽然文本中没有明确提到，但已知CeO2可以活化CO2，但其作用可能更多地集中在焦炭去除和RWGS上，而不是直接参与ODH循环。

3. Ga2O3和In2O3：这些催化剂有效地利用CO2进行焦炭去除和RWGS，通过移动平衡和维持催化剂活性间接促进ODH。

4. 过渡金属簇：文本没有提供关于这些的具体信息。

使用CO2作为氧化剂通常会导致更高的丙烯选择性和较低的碳生成，相比传统氧化剂。然而，文本中没有明确提供CO2解离的能量障碍，因此难以比较CO2在不同催化剂上的活化效率。

总之，虽然O2等传统氧化剂可以完全再氧化催化剂，但CO2作为一种较温和的氧化剂。其有效性和作用机制因催化剂类型而异，对于氧化还原活性催化剂，它直接参与ODH循环；对于非氧化还原活性催化剂，它通过焦炭去除和平衡移动间接促进反应。

The mechanisms of C-H bond activation and catalyst regeneration differ between redox-active and redox-inactive metal oxide catalysts in the oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes.

For redox-active catalysts like vanadium and chromium oxides, the Mars-Van Krevelen mechanism is generally accepted. In this mechanism, lattice oxygen from the metal oxide participates in C-H bond activation, forming the alkene product and reducing the metal center. The catalyst is then regenerated by the oxidant, which reoxidizes the reduced metal center.

When using CO2 as an oxidant with redox-active catalysts, it can reoxidize partially reduced metal oxides. For example, CO2 can oxidize V2O3 to V2O4, participating in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propylene. This regeneration step with CO2 is faster than the rate-limiting C-H activation step.

For redox-inactive catalysts like gallium and indium oxides, CO2 plays a different role. It enhances the removal of coke, participates in the Boudouard reaction, and drives the reverse water gas shift (RWGS) reaction. In these cases, CO2 does not directly participate in the redox cycle of the catalyst but rather helps maintain catalyst activity and shift the equilibrium towards dehydrogenation products.

Regarding the effectiveness of different catalysts in activating CO2 for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane:

1. V2O5 and VOx/SiO2: These are effective catalysts for CO2-assisted propane dehydrogenation. DFT calculations show that the rate-limiting step is the activation of the secondary C-H bond of propane, while the reoxidation of the catalyst by CO2 occurs faster.

2. CeO2: While not explicitly mentioned in the given text, cerium oxide is known for its oxygen storage capacity and ability to participate in redox reactions, which could make it potentially useful for CO2 activation.

3. Transition metal clusters: The text does not provide specific information on these catalysts for CO2-assisted propane dehydrogenation.

The proposed mechanism for CO2 activation on vanadium-based catalysts involves the reoxidation of reduced vanadium species (V2O3 to V2O4). The energy barrier for this step is lower than that of C-H bond activation, making it relatively efficient.

In summary, redox-active metal oxides like vanadium-based catalysts appear to be more effective in activating CO2 for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane, as they can directly incorporate CO2 into their redox cycle. The effectiveness of other catalysts like CeO2 and transition metal clusters would require further investigation to determine their specific mechanisms and energy barriers for CO2 activation in this reaction.

对于像钒和铬氧化物这样的氧化还原活性催化剂，通常接受Mars-Van Krevelen机制。在这种机制中，金属氧化物的晶格氧参与C-H键的活化，形成烯烃产物并还原金属中心。然后，氧化剂重新氧化还原的金属中心，从而再生催化剂。

当使用CO2作为氧化剂与氧化还原活性催化剂时，它可以重新氧化部分还原的金属氧化物。例如，CO2可以将V2O3氧化为V2O4，参与丙烷到丙烯的氧化脱氢。这个使用CO2的再生步骤比限速的C-H活化步骤更快。

对于像镓和铟氧化物这样的非氧化还原活性催化剂，CO2起着不同的作用。它增强了积碳的去除，参与布道反应，并推动逆水气变换（RWGS）反应。在这些情况下，CO2不直接参与催化剂的氧化还原循环，而是帮助维持催化剂活性并将平衡转向脱氢产物。

关于不同催化剂在活化CO2用于丙烷氧化脱氢的有效性：

1. V2O5和VOx/SiO2：这些是CO2辅助丙烷脱氢的有效催化剂。DFT计算表明，限速步骤是丙烷二级C-H键的活化，而CO2对催化剂的再氧化发生得更快。

2. CeO2：虽然在给定的文本中没有明确提到，但氧化铈以其氧储存能力和参与氧化还原反应的能力而闻名，这可能使其对CO2活化有潜在用途。

3. 过渡金属簇：文本没有提供这些催化剂用于CO2辅助丙烷脱氢的具体信息。

在钒基催化剂上CO2活化的提议机制涉及还原钒物种的再氧化（V2O3到V2O4）。这个步骤的能量障碍低于C-H键活化，使其相对高效。

总之，像钒基催化剂这样的氧化还原活性金属氧化物似乎在活化CO2用于丙烷的氧化脱氢方面更有效，因为它们可以直接将CO2纳入其氧化还原循环。其他催化剂如CeO2和过渡金属簇的有效性需要进一步研究，以确定它们在这个反应中活化CO2的具体机制和能量障碍。

The mechanisms of C-H bond activation and catalyst regeneration differ between redox-active and redox-inactive metal oxide catalysts in the oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes. For redox-active catalysts like V2O5 and VOx/SiO2, the process typically follows a Mars-van Krevelen mechanism, where lattice oxygen participates in the reaction and is then replenished by the oxidant. 

In the case of CO2 as an oxidant, it can oxidize V2O3 to V2O4, participating in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propylene. The reaction proceeds through both oxidative dehydrogenation and non-oxidative dehydrogenation routes, coupled with the reverse water gas shift reaction.

For redox-inactive catalysts like CeO2, the mechanism is different, often involving the formation of active oxygen species on the catalyst surface without changing the oxidation state of the metal.

Regarding the effectiveness of different catalysts in activating CO2 for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane, VOx/SiO2 catalysts show promising results. The DFT calculations indicate that while the rate-limiting step is the activation of the secondary C-H bond of propane (with an activation energy of 158 kJ/mol), the re-oxidation of the catalyst by CO2 is faster. This suggests that VOx/SiO2 catalysts are effective in activating CO2 for this reaction.

The use of CO2 as an oxidant leads to higher selectivity towards propylene and reduces carbon formation on the catalyst. The proposed mechanism involves parallel pathways of direct oxidative dehydrogenation and non-oxidative dehydrogenation followed by the reverse water gas shift reaction.

While the literature doesn't provide specific information on CeO2 or transition metal clusters for this reaction, the effectiveness of VOx/SiO2 catalysts in activating CO2 for propane dehydrogenation is clearly demonstrated.

The mechanisms of C-H bond activation and catalyst regeneration differ between redox-active and redox-inactive metal oxide catalysts in the oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of alkanes.

For redox-active catalysts like V2O5 and VOx/SiO2, the Mars-Van Krevelen mechanism is generally accepted. In this mechanism, lattice oxygen from the metal oxide participates in C-H bond activation, forming water and reducing the metal oxide. The catalyst is then regenerated by re-oxidation with an oxidant.

Traditional oxidants like O2 can fully re-oxidize these catalysts, but CO2 acts as a milder oxidant. For vanadium-based catalysts, CO2 can oxidize V2O3 to V2O4, but not to V2O5. This partial re-oxidation leads to higher selectivity towards propylene and reduced carbon formation compared to using O2.

For redox-inactive catalysts like CeO2, the mechanism likely involves surface-adsorbed oxygen species rather than lattice oxygen. These catalysts may activate CO2 differently, potentially through the formation of carbonate species on the surface.

The effectiveness of different catalysts in activating CO2 for ODH of propane varies:

1. Vanadium-based catalysts (V2O5, VOx/SiO2) show good activity, with CO2 re-oxidizing the partially reduced metal oxide.

2. Chromium-based catalysts also demonstrate the ability to be re-oxidized by CO2.

3. Gallium and indium-based catalysts utilize CO2 differently, promoting coke removal and participating in the reverse water gas shift reaction.

4. Transition metal clusters may activate CO2 through different mechanisms, but specific information is not provided in the given text.

The energy barrier for CO2 dissociation is not explicitly stated for most catalysts. However, for the VOx/SiO2 catalyst, DFT calculations suggest that the rate-limiting step is the activation of the secondary C-H bond of propane (activation energy of 158 kJ/mol), while the re-oxidation of the catalyst with CO2 is faster. This implies that CO2 activation is not the limiting factor for this particular catalyst system.

In summary, the effectiveness of catalysts in activating CO2 for ODH of propane depends on their ability to facilitate CO2 dissociation and incorporate the resulting oxygen into the catalyst structure or reaction mechanism. The specific mechanisms and energy barriers vary among different catalyst types, with redox-active metal oxides showing promising results in CO2-assisted ODH of propane.

总之，催化剂在活化CO2用于丙烷ODH反应的效果取决于它们促进CO2解离并将所得氧并入催化剂结构或反应机理的能力。不同类型催化剂的具体机理和能量障碍各不相同，其中氧化还原活性金属氧化物在CO2辅助的丙烷ODH反应中显示出有前景的结果。

The re-oxidation of the catalyst by CO2 is calculated to be faster than this C-H activation step.

For redox-inactive catalysts like CeO2, the mechanism likely involves direct activation of the C-H bond on the catalyst surface, followed by reaction with adsorbed oxidant species. The effectiveness of CO2 activation on these catalysts would depend on their ability to adsorb and activate CO2.

While the literature doesn't provide specific information on transition metal clusters, their mechanism would likely depend on their redox properties and ability to activate CO2. More research would be needed to compare their effectiveness to the other catalysts mentioned.

Overall, the choice of oxidant (traditional vs CO2) and catalyst type significantly impacts the reaction mechanism and effectiveness of oxidative dehydrogenation of propane.
