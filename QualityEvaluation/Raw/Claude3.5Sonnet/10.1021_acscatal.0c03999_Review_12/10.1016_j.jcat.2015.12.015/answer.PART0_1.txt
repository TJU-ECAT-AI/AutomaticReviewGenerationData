The mechanisms of C-H bond activation and catalyst regeneration differ between redox-active and redox-inactive metal oxide catalysts in the oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes.

For redox-active catalysts like vanadium and chromium oxides, the Mars-Van Krevelen mechanism is generally accepted. In this mechanism, lattice oxygen from the metal oxide participates in C-H bond activation, forming the alkene product and reducing the metal center. The catalyst is then regenerated by the oxidant, which reoxidizes the reduced metal center.

When using CO2 as an oxidant with redox-active catalysts, it can reoxidize partially reduced metal oxides. For example, CO2 can oxidize V2O3 to V2O4, participating in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propylene. This regeneration step with CO2 is faster than the rate-limiting C-H activation step.

For redox-inactive catalysts like gallium and indium oxides, CO2 plays a different role. It enhances the removal of coke, participates in the Boudouard reaction, and drives the reverse water gas shift (RWGS) reaction. In these cases, CO2 does not directly participate in the redox cycle of the catalyst but rather helps maintain catalyst activity and shift the equilibrium towards dehydrogenation products.

Regarding the effectiveness of different catalysts in activating CO2 for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane:

1. V2O5 and VOx/SiO2: These are effective catalysts for CO2-assisted propane dehydrogenation. DFT calculations show that the rate-limiting step is the activation of the secondary C-H bond of propane, while the reoxidation of the catalyst by CO2 occurs faster.

2. CeO2: While not explicitly mentioned in the given text, cerium oxide is known for its oxygen storage capacity and ability to participate in redox reactions, which could make it potentially useful for CO2 activation.

3. Transition metal clusters: The text does not provide specific information on these catalysts for CO2-assisted propane dehydrogenation.

The proposed mechanism for CO2 activation on vanadium-based catalysts involves the reoxidation of reduced vanadium species (V2O3 to V2O4). The energy barrier for this step is lower than that of C-H bond activation, making it relatively efficient.

In summary, redox-active metal oxides like vanadium-based catalysts appear to be more effective in activating CO2 for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane, as they can directly incorporate CO2 into their redox cycle. The effectiveness of other catalysts like CeO2 and transition metal clusters would require further investigation to determine their specific mechanisms and energy barriers for CO2 activation in this reaction.

在烷烃的氧化脱氢过程中，氧化还原活性和非氧化还原活性金属氧化物催化剂的C-H键活化和催化剂再生机制是不同的。

对于像钒和铬氧化物这样的氧化还原活性催化剂，通常接受Mars-Van Krevelen机制。在这种机制中，金属氧化物的晶格氧参与C-H键的活化，形成烯烃产物并还原金属中心。然后，氧化剂重新氧化还原的金属中心，从而再生催化剂。

当使用CO2作为氧化剂与氧化还原活性催化剂时，它可以重新氧化部分还原的金属氧化物。例如，CO2可以将V2O3氧化为V2O4，参与丙烷到丙烯的氧化脱氢。这个使用CO2的再生步骤比限速的C-H活化步骤更快。

对于像镓和铟氧化物这样的非氧化还原活性催化剂，CO2起着不同的作用。它增强了积碳的去除，参与布道反应，并推动逆水气变换（RWGS）反应。在这些情况下，CO2不直接参与催化剂的氧化还原循环，而是帮助维持催化剂活性并将平衡转向脱氢产物。

关于不同催化剂在活化CO2用于丙烷氧化脱氢的有效性：

1. V2O5和VOx/SiO2：这些是CO2辅助丙烷脱氢的有效催化剂。DFT计算表明，限速步骤是丙烷二级C-H键的活化，而CO2对催化剂的再氧化发生得更快。

2. CeO2：虽然在给定的文本中没有明确提到，但氧化铈以其氧储存能力和参与氧化还原反应的能力而闻名，这可能使其对CO2活化有潜在用途。

3. 过渡金属簇：文本没有提供这些催化剂用于CO2辅助丙烷脱氢的具体信息。

在钒基催化剂上CO2活化的提议机制涉及还原钒物种的再氧化（V2O3到V2O4）。这个步骤的能量障碍低于C-H键活化，使其相对高效。

总之，像钒基催化剂这样的氧化还原活性金属氧化物似乎在活化CO2用于丙烷的氧化脱氢方面更有效，因为它们可以直接将CO2纳入其氧化还原循环。其他催化剂如CeO2和过渡金属簇的有效性需要进一步研究，以确定它们在这个反应中活化CO2的具体机制和能量障碍。
