[1] "CO2 has the ability to oxidize V2O3 to V2O4 and participates in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propylene."

[2] "Only 45% of the resulting water contains D2O. This confirms that the reaction follows the oxidative dehydrogenation route of propane but is also accompanied by the reverse water gas shift reaction in combination with the non-oxidative dehydrogenation route."

[3] "According to the DFT-calculated Gibbs free energy profile at 600 C, the activation of the secondary CAH bond of propane (EDFT,act = 158 kJ/mol) is rate-limiting, while re-oxidation of the catalyst with CO2 is potentially much faster."

[4] "CO2-assisted propane dehydrogenation results in a higher selectivity toward propylene production and a reduction of carbon formation."

[5] "Based on the DFT-calculated Gibbs free energy profile at 600 C, CO2-assisted propane dehydrogenation is limited by the activation of the secondary CAH bond of propane, while re-oxidation of the catalyst with CO2 is occurring on a smaller timescale."

The mechanisms of C-H bond activation and catalyst regeneration differ between redox-active and redox-inactive metal oxide catalysts in the oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes. For redox-active catalysts like V2O5 and VOx/SiO2, the process typically follows a Mars-van Krevelen mechanism, where lattice oxygen participates in the reaction and is then replenished by the oxidant. 

In the case of CO2 as an oxidant, it can oxidize V2O3 to V2O4, participating in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propylene. The reaction proceeds through both oxidative dehydrogenation and non-oxidative dehydrogenation routes, coupled with the reverse water gas shift reaction.

For redox-inactive catalysts like CeO2, the mechanism is different, often involving the formation of active oxygen species on the catalyst surface without changing the oxidation state of the metal.

Regarding the effectiveness of different catalysts in activating CO2 for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane, VOx/SiO2 catalysts show promising results. The DFT calculations indicate that while the rate-limiting step is the activation of the secondary C-H bond of propane (with an activation energy of 158 kJ/mol), the re-oxidation of the catalyst by CO2 is faster. This suggests that VOx/SiO2 catalysts are effective in activating CO2 for this reaction.

The use of CO2 as an oxidant leads to higher selectivity towards propylene and reduces carbon formation on the catalyst. The proposed mechanism involves parallel pathways of direct oxidative dehydrogenation and non-oxidative dehydrogenation followed by the reverse water gas shift reaction.

While the literature doesn't provide specific information on CeO2 or transition metal clusters for this reaction, the effectiveness of VOx/SiO2 catalysts in activating CO2 for propane dehydrogenation is clearly demonstrated.

在烷烃氧化脱氢过程中，氧化还原活性和非氧化还原活性金属氧化物催化剂的C-H键活化和催化剂再生机制存在差异。对于V2O5和VOx/SiO2等氧化还原活性催化剂，该过程通常遵循Mars-van Krevelen机制，其中晶格氧参与反应，然后由氧化剂补充。

当CO2作为氧化剂时，它可以将V2O3氧化为V2O4，参与丙烷到丙烯的氧化脱氢。反应通过氧化脱氢和非氧化脱氢两种途径进行，并伴随逆水气变换反应。

对于CeO2等非氧化还原活性催化剂，机制不同，通常涉及在催化剂表面形成活性氧物种，而不改变金属的氧化态。

关于不同催化剂在活化CO2用于丙烷氧化脱氢的效果，VOx/SiO2催化剂显示出promising的结果。DFT计算表明，虽然限速步骤是丙烷次级C-H键的活化（活化能为158 kJ/mol），但催化剂被CO2再氧化的速度更快。这表明VOx/SiO2催化剂在活化CO2用于此反应方面是有效的。

使用CO2作为氧化剂可以提高丙烯的选择性，并减少催化剂上的碳沉积。提出的机制涉及直接氧化脱氢和非氧化脱氢随后进行逆水气变换反应的平行途径。

虽然文献没有提供CeO2或过渡金属簇用于此反应的具体信息，但VOx/SiO2催化剂在活化CO2用于丙烷脱氢方面的有效性已得到明确证实。
