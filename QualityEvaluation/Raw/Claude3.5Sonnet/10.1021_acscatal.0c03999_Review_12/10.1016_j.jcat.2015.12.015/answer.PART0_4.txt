[1] "CO2 has the ability to oxidize V2O3 to V2O4 and participates in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propylene."

[2] "CO2 can re-oxidize partially reduced metal oxides. It is generally accepted that it follows a proposed pathway which is in agreement with the Mars-Van Krevelen mechanism"

[3] "When the catalyst is reduced, and subsequently re-oxidized with CO2 instead of O2 at the same temperature, the H2 consumption peak is about 0.86 ± 0.13 mol/molVOx which is 45 ± 7% of that of the samples that have been oxidized by O2. This clearly indicates that less than half of the exchangeable oxygen is regenerated by CO2, which can be attributed to the oxidation of V2O3 into V2O4 instead of V2O5."

[4] "According to the DFT-calculated Gibbs free energy profile at 600°C, the activation of the secondary C–H bond of propane (EDFT,act = 158 kJ/mol) is rate-limiting, while re-oxidation of the catalyst with CO2 is potentially much faster."

[5] "Based on the DFT-calculated Gibbs free energy profile at 600°C, CO2-assisted propane dehydrogenation is limited by the activation of the secondary C–H bond of propane, while re-oxidation of the catalyst with CO2 is occurring on a smaller timescale."

The mechanisms of C-H bond activation and catalyst regeneration differ between redox-active and redox-inactive metal oxide catalysts in the oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes.

For redox-active catalysts like V2O5 and VOx/SiO2, the Mars-Van Krevelen mechanism is generally accepted. In this mechanism, lattice oxygen from the metal oxide participates in the C-H bond activation, forming the alkene product and reducing the metal oxide. The catalyst is then re-oxidized by the oxidant.

Traditional oxidants like O2 can fully re-oxidize the catalyst. However, CO2 acts as a milder oxidant. It can oxidize V2O3 to V2O4 but cannot fully regenerate V2O5. This partial re-oxidation still allows the catalyst to participate in the oxidative dehydrogenation cycle, albeit with potentially different selectivity.

The effectiveness of catalysts in activating CO2 for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane varies. V2O5-based catalysts show good activity, with CO2 able to re-oxidize the reduced vanadium species. The DFT calculations suggest that for VOx/SiO2 catalysts, the rate-limiting step is the activation of the secondary C-H bond of propane, with an activation energy of 158 kJ/mol. The re-oxidation of the catalyst by CO2 is calculated to be faster than this C-H activation step.

For redox-inactive catalysts like CeO2, the mechanism likely involves direct activation of the C-H bond on the catalyst surface, followed by reaction with adsorbed oxidant species. The effectiveness of CO2 activation on these catalysts would depend on their ability to adsorb and activate CO2.

While the literature doesn't provide specific information on transition metal clusters, their mechanism would likely depend on their redox properties and ability to activate CO2. More research would be needed to compare their effectiveness to the other catalysts mentioned.

Overall, the choice of oxidant (traditional vs CO2) and catalyst type significantly impacts the reaction mechanism and effectiveness of oxidative dehydrogenation of propane.

在烷烃的氧化脱氢过程中，氧化还原活性和非氧化还原活性金属氧化物催化剂的C-H键活化和催化剂再生机理存在差异。

对于V2O5和VOx/SiO2等氧化还原活性催化剂，通常接受Mars-Van Krevelen机理。在这种机理中，金属氧化物的晶格氧参与C-H键的活化，形成烯烃产物并还原金属氧化物。然后催化剂被氧化剂再氧化。

传统氧化剂如O2可以完全再氧化催化剂。然而，CO2作为一种较温和的氧化剂，可以将V2O3氧化到V2O4，但不能完全再生V2O5。这种部分再氧化仍然允许催化剂参与氧化脱氢循环，尽管可能具有不同的选择性。

催化剂在活化CO2用于丙烷氧化脱氢方面的有效性各不相同。基于V2O5的催化剂显示出良好的活性，CO2能够再氧化还原的钒物种。DFT计算表明，对于VOx/SiO2催化剂，速率限制步骤是丙烷仲碳C-H键的活化，活化能为158 kJ/mol。计算表明，CO2对催化剂的再氧化比这个C-H活化步骤更快。

对于CeO2等非氧化还原活性催化剂，其机理可能涉及催化剂表面上C-H键的直接活化，然后与吸附的氧化剂物种反应。CO2在这些催化剂上的活化效果将取决于它们吸附和活化CO2的能力。

虽然文献没有提供有关过渡金属簇的具体信息，但它们的机理可能取决于它们的氧化还原性质和活化CO2的能力。需要进行更多研究来比较它们与其他提到的催化剂的有效性。

总的来说，氧化剂（传统vs CO2）和催化剂类型的选择显著影响丙烷氧化脱氢的反应机理和有效性。
