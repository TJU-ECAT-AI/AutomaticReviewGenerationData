[1] "It is commonly accepted that the ODP reaction over vanadia-based catalysts proceeds via a Mars–van Krevelen mechanism. This mechanism suggests that C3H8 removes lattice oxygen from VOx species, yielding C3H6, H2O, and a reduced VOx center (Eq. (3)). Subsequently, the lattice oxygen is replenished by gas-phase oxygen in a re-oxidation step (Eq. (4))."

[2] "Since the rate of catalyst re-oxidation by N2O is slower than that by O2, a lower steady-state concentration of lattice oxygen is expected to be responsible for C3H8 activation in the presence of N2O."

[3] "From the stoichiometric requirements of the ODP reaction it is postulated that one selective catalyst site should contain one to two active lattice-oxygen anions to obtain the desired propene. Active sites with more than two active lattice oxygen anions would favor the formation of waste products (i.e., CO and CO2) by consecutive total oxidation steps."

The literature does not directly compare redox-active and redox-inactive metal oxide catalysts or discuss CO2 as an oxidant for oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes. However, it does provide some insights into the mechanism for vanadium-based catalysts:

For redox-active catalysts like vanadium oxides, the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane proceeds via a Mars-van Krevelen mechanism. This involves:

1. C-H bond activation: Propane removes lattice oxygen from the VOx species, producing propene, water, and reduced VOx.

2. Catalyst regeneration: Gas-phase oxygen (O2 or N2O) re-oxidizes the reduced VOx, replenishing the lattice oxygen.

The effectiveness of the oxidant impacts the reaction:

- O2 re-oxidizes the catalyst more quickly than N2O, leading to higher activity but potentially lower selectivity due to over-oxidation.
- N2O re-oxidizes more slowly, resulting in lower activity but higher propene selectivity due to a lower density of active lattice oxygen species.

The literature does not discuss CO2 activation or other catalysts like CeO2 or transition metal clusters for this reaction. To fully answer the question, additional information on redox-inactive catalysts, CO2 activation, and other catalyst types would be needed.

该文献没有直接比较氧化还原活性和非活性金属氧化物催化剂，也没有讨论CO2作为烷烃氧化脱氢的氧化剂。然而，它确实提供了一些关于钒基催化剂机理的见解：

对于钒氧化物等氧化还原活性催化剂，丙烷的氧化脱氢通过Mars-van Krevelen机理进行。这包括：

1. C-H键活化：丙烷从VOx物种中移除晶格氧，产生丙烯、水和还原的VOx。

2. 催化剂再生：气相氧（O2或N2O）重新氧化还原的VOx，补充晶格氧。

氧化剂的有效性影响反应：

- O2比N2O更快地重新氧化催化剂，导致活性更高，但由于过度氧化可能导致选择性较低。
- N2O重新氧化较慢，导致活性较低但丙烯选择性较高，这是由于活性晶格氧物种密度较低。

文献没有讨论CO2的活化或其他催化剂如CeO2或过渡金属簇对这个反应的影响。要全面回答这个问题，还需要有关氧化还原非活性催化剂、CO2活化和其他类型催化剂的额外信息。

[2] "For the calculation of TOF values, the total number of vanadium atoms (including those in the bulk) was used without consideration of the fact that not vanadium atoms, but the lattice oxygen of VOx species, participates in C3H8 activation."

[3] "Since several oxygen species are needed for COx formation in contrast to C3H6 formation, the latter reaction pathway prevails at low densities/concentrations of active oxygen species."

[4] "N2O re-oxidizes reduced VOx sites more slowly as compared with O2, yielding a lower concentration of active lattice oxygen and, therefore, its lower density."

It also does not discuss the role of CO2 as an oxidant or the effectiveness of different catalysts like CeO2 and transition metal clusters in activating CO2 for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane.

However, the document does provide some insights into the mechanism for vanadia-based catalysts, which are redox-active:

1. C-H bond activation: For vanadia-based catalysts, the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODP) proceeds via a Mars-van Krevelen mechanism. In this process, propane removes lattice oxygen from VOx species, resulting in the formation of propene, water, and a reduced VOx center.

2. Catalyst regeneration: After the C-H activation step, the lattice oxygen is replenished by gas-phase oxygen in a re-oxidation step. The rate of this re-oxidation affects the overall catalytic performance.

3. Role of oxidants: The study compares O2 and N2O as oxidants. N2O re-oxidizes reduced VOx sites more slowly than O2, resulting in a lower concentration and density of active lattice oxygen. This leads to higher propene selectivity with N2O compared to O2.

4. Selectivity considerations: The formation of COx requires several oxygen species, while C3H6 formation requires fewer. Therefore, lower densities/concentrations of active oxygen species favor propene formation over COx formation.

The document does not provide information on redox-inactive catalysts, CO2 as an oxidant, or the effectiveness of other catalysts like CeO2 and transition metal clusters in activating CO2 for ODP. Therefore, a comprehensive comparison of these aspects cannot be made based on the given literature.

该文献并未直接比较和对比氧化还原活性和氧化还原惰性金属氧化物催化剂在烷烃氧化脱氢中的C-H键活化和催化剂再生机制。它也没有讨论CO2作为氧化剂的作用，或者CeO2和过渡金属簇等不同催化剂在活化CO2用于丙烷氧化脱氢方面的有效性。

然而，该文档确实提供了一些关于钒基催化剂（属于氧化还原活性催化剂）机制的见解：

1. C-H键活化：对于钒基催化剂，丙烷的氧化脱氢（ODP）通过Mars-van Krevelen机制进行。在这个过程中，丙烷从VOx物种中移除晶格氧，生成丙烯、水和还原态的VOx中心。

2. 催化剂再生：在C-H活化步骤之后，晶格氧通过气相氧在再氧化步骤中得到补充。这种再氧化的速率影响整体催化性能。

3. 氧化剂的作用：该研究比较了O2和N2O作为氧化剂。N2O比O2更慢地再氧化还原态的VOx位点，导致活性晶格氧的浓度和密度较低。这使得使用N2O时的丙烯选择性高于使用O2时。

4. 选择性考虑：COx的形成需要多个氧物种，而C3H6的形成需要的氧物种较少。因此，较低密度/浓度的活性氧物种有利于丙烯的形成而不是COx的形成。

该文档没有提供关于氧化还原惰性催化剂、CO2作为氧化剂，或其他催化剂如CeO2和过渡金属簇在活化CO2用于ODP方面的有效性的信息。因此，基于给定的文献无法对这些方面进行全面的比较。

The literature does not directly compare redox-active and redox-inactive metal oxide catalysts for oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of alkanes. However, it does discuss the mechanism for vanadium-based catalysts, which are redox-active.

For redox-active catalysts like vanadium oxides, the ODH reaction proceeds via a Mars-van Krevelen mechanism. In this process, propane removes lattice oxygen from VOx species, producing propene, water, and reduced VOx. The catalyst is then regenerated by gas-phase oxygen, which replenishes the lattice oxygen.

The literature does not discuss CO2 as an oxidant for ODH. It compares O2 and N2O, noting that N2O is a weaker oxidant that re-oxidizes the catalyst more slowly than O2. This results in a lower steady-state concentration of active lattice oxygen, which can improve selectivity towards propene by reducing over-oxidation to COx.

The document does not provide information on CeO2 or transition metal clusters for CO2 activation in ODH of propane. It also does not discuss energy barriers for CO2 dissociation or proposed mechanisms for CO2 activation on different catalysts.

The literature suggests that catalyst design should aim for high dispersion of reducible metal oxides on inert supports, with the metal oxides being more easily reduced by hydrocarbons than re-oxidized by the oxidant. This approach spatially isolates active lattice oxygen species, favoring selective oxidation over combustion reactions.

这篇文献没有直接比较氧化还原活性和非活性金属氧化物催化剂在烷烃氧化脱氢(ODH)中的作用。但是,它确实讨论了钒基催化剂(氧化还原活性催化剂)的反应机理。

对于像钒氧化物这样的氧化还原活性催化剂,ODH反应是通过Mars-van Krevelen机理进行的。在这个过程中,丙烷从VOx物种中移除晶格氧,生成丙烯、水和还原态的VOx。然后催化剂被气相氧再生,补充晶格氧。

文献没有讨论CO2作为ODH的氧化剂。它比较了O2和N2O,指出N2O是一种较弱的氧化剂,比O2更慢地再氧化催化剂。这导致活性晶格氧的稳态浓度较低,可以通过减少过氧化到COx来提高对丙烯的选择性。

该文档没有提供关于CeO2或过渡金属簇在丙烷ODH中活化CO2的信息。它也没有讨论CO2解离的能量障碍或不同催化剂上CO2活化的proposed机理。

文献建议,催化剂设计应该在惰性载体上高度分散可还原的金属氧化物,使金属氧化物更容易被烃类还原而不是被氧化剂再氧化。这种方法可以使活性晶格氧物种空间隔离,有利于选择性氧化而不是燃烧反应。

2. The rate of catalyst re-oxidation affects the steady-state concentration of lattice oxygen, which in turn influences the catalyst's activity and selectivity. For example, N2O re-oxidizes the catalyst more slowly than O2, resulting in a lower concentration of lattice oxygen and higher propene selectivity.

3. The number of active lattice-oxygen anions at a catalyst site influences the product distribution. Sites with one to two oxygen anions favor propene formation, while sites with more than two oxygen anions promote total oxidation to CO and CO2.

The document does not provide information on CO2 activation or its use as an oxidant in ODP reactions, nor does it discuss other catalysts like CeO2 or transition metal clusters.
