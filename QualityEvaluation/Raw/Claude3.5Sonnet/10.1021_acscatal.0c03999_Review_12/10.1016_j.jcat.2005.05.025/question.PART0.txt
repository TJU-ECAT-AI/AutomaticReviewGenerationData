Abstract
A series of V/MCM-41 catalytic materials was synthesized by impregnation of MCM-41 and the addition of vanadium during the prepa-
ration of MCM-41. The nature and distribution of the VOx species were studied by different spectroscopic techniques (TEM, TPR, in situ
UVvis, and in situ Raman). Highly dispersed VOx species, which can be classified as monomeric and small two-dimensional VOx aggre-
gates, are present in materials with a vanadium loading of up to 5.3 wt% under conditions of the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODP)
and are independent of the preparation method. These VOx species exhibit similar specific catalytic performance in the ODP reaction as a
function of vanadium loading or apparent vanadium surface density. Crystalline V2O5 nanoparticles, however, are formed for 11.2 wt% V
when the MCM-41 porous structure collapses. For all V/MCM-41 catalysts used in this study, higher propene selectivity is achieved with
N2O as compared with O2 at similar degrees of C3H8 conversion. The catalytic activity is lower, however, in the presence of N2O as com-
pared with O2 because of the weaker oxidizing potential of N2O relative to O2 for the re-oxidation of the reduced surface VOx sites during
the ODP reaction. There is no significant difference in propene selectivity between highly dispersed surface VOx species and crystalline
V2O5 nanoparticles when N2O is used as an oxidant. In contrast to highly dispersed VOx on the surface of MCM-41, the crystalline V2O5
nanoparticles are not selective for the ODP reaction in the presence of O2. The positive effect of N2O is related to the inhibition of direct
C3H8 oxidation and the consecutive oxidation of C3H6 to COx. The inhibition is ascribed to reducing surface density (spatial separation) of
active surface lattice oxygen in VOx species, since N2O is a weaker oxidant for re-oxidation of reduced VOx species as compared with O2.
From a stoichiometric point of view of the ODP reaction, selective propene formation is favored over combustion reactions at lower surface
densities.

Conversion of low alkanes to value-added olefins, the
building blocks of the petrochemical industry, by selective
oxidative dehydrogenation reactions may become a poten-

improved. The oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODP)
to propene has been intensively investigated because of in-
creasing world demand for propene. However, this reaction
is kinetically limited for attaining high propene yields, since
the selective reaction product, propene, is more reactive than
propane and is easily combusted in the oxidizing environ-
ment [1]. Therefore, designing suitable catalysts and/or a
suitable process environment is an important challenge for
the coming years. Numerous catalytic systems have been
evaluated for the ODP reaction, and the relevant results have

recently been reviewed [2,3]. Vanadium- and molybdenum-
based catalytic materials are claimed to be most active and
selective for the ODP reaction with O2 [46]. Supported
vanadium oxide catalysts have typically been found to be
more selective than the unsupported bulk V2O5 material
because of the interactions of VOx species with the oxide
support substrates (e.g., Al2O3, Nb2O5, TiO2, ZrO2, SiO2,
etc.) [79]. It has been reported that the interaction between
the oxide support and the deposited vanadium oxide deter-
mines the structure of the resulting surface VOx species [10].
Dehydrated surface VOx species have been found to pos-
sess VO4 coordination with one terminal V=O bond, with
varying degrees of polymerization on the different supports.
At high surface vanadium oxide coverage, crystalline V2O5
nanoparticles also exist. The catalytic activity in ODP and
the propene selectivity are considered to be a function of
these different vanadium oxide species and the specific sup-
port used. The factors that govern the catalytic performance
of the surface VOx species, however, are still being debated.
Recent studies of supported vanadium oxide on differ-
ent mesoporous silicas have revealed that such materials are
active and selective for the oxidative dehydrogenation of
propane and ethane [1115]. Mesoporous materials provide
high surface areas and, hence, the potential for high disper-
sion of the catalytic active surface VOx species. The rate
of propene formation appears to vary with the dispersion of
these species. Therefore the challenge is to achieve maxi-
mum dispersion of surface VOx species. The overall per-
formance of mesoporous supported vanadia catalysts for the
ODP reaction is also a function of the chosen reaction condi-
tions. The addition of small amounts of H2O, CO2, and N2O
to the ODP reaction feed [1618] has been found to increase
the propene selectivity at the expense of catalytic activity.
When CO2 was used as the oxidant, the propene selectiv-
ity over a gallium oxide catalyst was enhanced [19]. The use
of CO2 as an alternative oxidant, however, is limited by cata-
lyst coking and by-product CO formation. Nitrous oxide was
also applied as an oxidant for the ODP reaction over sup-
ported VOx/γ -Al2O3 [20], resulting in an improved propene
selectivity as compared with molecular oxygen. This finding
suggests that N2O may be promising as an oxidant for the
ODP reaction.
Based on the above background, the present investiga-
tion is focused on understanding the influence of N2O and
O2 as oxidants on the catalytic performance (activity and
selectivityconversion relationship) of supported V/MCM-
41 catalytic materials for the ODP reaction. The effect of
preparation methods and vanadium loadings on the distrib-
ution of VOx species on the MCM-41 support among iso-
lated surface VO4 species, polymeric surface VO4 species,
and crystalline V2O5 nanoparticles will be elucidated with
the application of different in situ spectroscopic methods.
This molecular-level information will be used in deriving
structurereactivityselectivity relationships of V/MCM-41
catalytic materials for the ODP reaction.
2. Experimental
2.1. Catalyst preparation
Two different preparation methods were chosen for depo-
sition of vanadia on the mesoporous MCM-41 support pre-
pared according to methods described in the literature [21].
One type of catalyst was prepared by impregnation of MCM-
41 with a predetermined amount of vanadium acetyl acetate
([CH3COCH=C(O)CH3]2VO) in toluene. The final mix-
ture was stirred at 300 K for 24 h, followed by filtering and
washing of the impregnated catalyst with toluene to remove
weakly bonded VOx species. The resulting catalyst precur-
sor was subsequently subjected to drying at 400 K for 12 h
and calcination at 823 K for 12 h. The second type of cata-
lyst was prepared with vanadyl sulfate (VO(SO)4) dissolved
in water that was mixed with tetraethylorthosilicate (TEOS)
and cetyltrimethyl ammonium bromide (CTAB); the latter
were templates used for the preparation of MCM-41 sup-
port. The resulting mixture was stirred for 24 h at 300 K
and subjected to filtration, drying, and calcination as de-
scribed above. Samples with different amounts of vanadium
loadings varying from 0.2 to 11.2 wt% were synthesized.
The catalysts are denoted here by their amount of vanadium
loading [e.g., V(2.7)/MCM-41 contains 2.7 wt% V in the
sample].
2.2. Catalyst characterization
The surface areas and the final vanadium contents were
determined by BET and ICP analysis, respectively, after
catalyst calcinations. The physical distribution of vanadium
over the MCM-41 support was examined with TEM. The
molecular distribution among the dehydrated isolated and
polymeric surface VO4 species and crystalline V2O5 was
studied by in situ Raman and in situ UVvis DRS. Crys-
talline V2O5 nanoparticles greater than 4 nm were subjected
to XRD. The reducibility of VOx species in the supported
V/MCM-41 catalysts was investigated by in situ UVvis
DRS and H2-TPR. A short description of each of the char-
acterization methods and experimental procedures is given
below.
Nitrogen physisorption was used to obtain specific sur-
face areas in a single-point BET analyzer (Gemini III 2375,
Micromeritics), with the use of N2 physisorption at 77 K.
The BET values are listed in Table 1. The method of Barret,
Joyner, and Halenda (BJH) was used to determine the pore
size distribution.
Inductively coupled plasma (ICP) measurements were
used to determine the vanadium concentrations of each cat-
alyst after calcination at 823 K. The final vanadium contents
of the different catalysts are listed in Table 1.
Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) investigations
of V/MCM-41 catalytic materials were performed for mor-
phology determinations on a Philips CM 200 FEG field
emission transmission electron microscope operated at
200 kV in vacuum.

UV Raman spectra were collected with a Jobin Yvon
Labram HR (high-resolution) spectrometer system with ex-
citation at 325 nm (0.2 mW) and spectral resolution better
than 2 cm1. The Raman system was equipped with a notch
filter to reject the Rayleigh scattering down to 300 cm1.
The scattered photons were directed and focused onto a
single-stage monochromator, with 1800 grooves/mm, and
a UV-sensitive CCD detector maintained at liquid-nitrogen
temperature. The in situ Raman spectra were taken of the
loose samples (1020 mg) at room temperature after dehy-
dration at 723 K in flowing oxygen (O2/He = 20:80) in an
environmental cell (Linkam, model T1600). Visible Raman
spectra were collected with a Kaiser Optical Systems RXN
spectrometer with excitation at 785 nm.
UVvis DRS measurements were performed on a Cary
400 Varian spectrometer equipped with an in situ environ-
mental cell (praying mantis, Harrick). The samples were
diluted with Al2O3 in a 1:10 ratio. The samples for in situ
measurements were pretreated in an O2/N2 (20% O2) mix-
ture at 773 K for 1 h. After this pretreatment, the in situ UV
vis DRS spectra of the catalytic materials were recorded at
773 K in an atmosphere of either hydrogen (H2/N2 = 10:90)
or propane (C3H8/N20 = 10:90). The spectra were con-
verted into the KubelkaMunk function F(R).
X-ray diffraction (XRD) analyses were carried out with
a STADIP transmission powder diffractometer (Stoe) with
Cu-Kα1 radiation.
We made H2-TPR measurements by heating 100 mg of
sample at 20 K/min to 1073 K in a gas mixture of hydrogen
(10 vol% in argon) with a total flow rate of 50 cm3
STP/min.
Hydrogen consumption was monitored by a thermal conduc-
tivity detector (TCD). Water formed or desorbed during TPR
measurements was removed by a 4-Å molecular sieve before
the flow entered the TCD. The hydrogen consumption was
calibrated by argon pulses continuously introduced into the
gas flow during sample heating.
2.3. Catalytic tests
A U-shaped fixed-bed quartz reactor (i.d. 5 mm) was used
for the catalytic tests. The quartz reactor was immersed in a
fluidized bed of sand serving as a source of heat. The tem-
perature within the fixed bed of catalyst particles was mea-
sured with an axially movable thermocouple located inside
a quartz capillary. Typically, 0.010.1 g of catalyst was di-
luted with similarly sized quartz particles and charged in the
reactor for further temperature control. The oxidative con-
version of propane was investigated with a feed of 40 vol%
C3H8 and 40 vol% N2O in Ne (C3H8/N2O/Ne = 40:40:20)
or 40 vol% C3H8 and 20 vol% O2 in N2 (C3H8/O2/N2 =
40:20:40) at 1 bar. Neon was used to control the formation
of N2 and O2 in the case of N2O decomposition. The total
flow rate and the reaction temperature were varied between
30 and 240 cm3
STP/min and 673 and 793 K, respectively.
All V/MCM-41 catalysts were slightly deactivating during
the first hour of time on stream with N2O as oxidant. Char-
acteristic reaction rates and product selectivities were only
determined after pseudo-steady state was reached. The feed
and products were analyzed with an online GC (HP 5800)
equipped with Porapak Q and molecular sieve-5 columns.
The contact times for kinetic measurements were adjusted to
achieve propane conversions of less than 4%, which allowed
for the determination of the initial propene selectivity and
the initial rates of product formation. The rate of propene
formation and turnover frequencie (TOFs) were calculated
according to Eqs. (1) and (2), respectively. The rate unit
is nC3H6·min1 g1, where nC3H6 is the number of propene
moles, g refers to the catalyst, and TOF is the number of
propene molecules formed per V atom and second.

3. Results
The following three sections describe the results of physi-
cal and chemical characterization of the supported V/MCM-
41 catalytic materials. The catalytic performance of these
materials in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane in the
presence of O2 and N2O is subsequently presented.
3.1. Morphology of V/MCM-41 materials as a function of
V content and preparation method
The specific surface areas (SBET) of the catalytic materi-
als and the pure MCM-41 support are listed in Table 1. There
is only a slight decrease in SBET of the supported V/MCM-
41 catalysts for vanadium loadings up to 5.3 wt%. This
is valid for both supported V/MCM-41 and materials pre-
pared by vanadium addition during synthesis of MCM-41.

SBET of V(11.2)/MCM-41 is significantly lower than that of
the other catalytic materials, indicating that the microstruc-
ture of MCM-41 is influenced by the comparatively high
vanadium loading. The average pore size was calculated to
be 2.7 nm for all of the catalytic materials, with the excep-
tion of V(11.2)/MCM-41. Thus, the mesoporous structure of
the support was preserved in most of the synthesized mate-
rials. This conclusion is further supported by the results of
the morphology as obtained by TEM measurements (Fig. 1);
the TEM image of the supported V(0.2)/MCM-41 catalyst is
shown in Fig. 1a, where the micrograph was taken with an
electron beam parallel to the pores. The TEM image reveals
that the highly ordered nanoporous structure of MCM-41 is
preserved after it is loaded with vanadium oxide. Although
X-ray energy-dispersive spectroscopy with the TEM reveals
the presence of vanadium, the absence of any vanadium ox-
ide contrast in Fig. 1a indicates that vanadium oxide must be
present in a dimension of less than 1 nm that is not detectable
in the TEM image. With increased vanadium loading, no
significant changes in the structure of MCM-41 or in the
vanadium distribution are observed (Fig. 1b). Higher load-
ings of vanadium cause a dramatic change in the MCM-41
structure, as shown for V(11.2)/MCM-41 in Fig. 1c: (i) all of
the nanoporous channels disappear; (ii) the MCM-41 struc-
ture undergoes a morphological change by agglomeration to
large debris, giving the polymer-like contrast in Fig. 1c; and
(iii) V2O5 crystals as large as several tens of nanometers are
found in this sample. These morphological changes result in
a dramatic drop of SBET from 800900 m2/g to 52 m2/g
(see Table 1).
The effect of vanadium loading on the crystallization
of V/MCM-41 materials was also investigated by powder
XRD. For samples with vanadium loading up to 5.3 wt%,
no spectral features indicating the presence of crystalline
V2O5 are present. This may be understood either as the
presence of small crystalline nanoparticles (<4 nm) or as
surface VOx species that cannot be detected by XRD be-
cause of the absence of long-range order. Intense reflexes
corresponding to crystalline V2O5 are visible, however, in
the XRD patterns of V(11.2)/MCM-41 (Fig. 2), which is in
agreement with the TEM observation shown in Fig. 1c. Ra-
man and UVvis spectroscopic characterization studies were

also undertaken to obtain more definitive information about
the possible presence of XRD-amorphous crystalline V2O5
nanoparticles and surface VOx species for samples possess-
ing up to 5.3 wt% V.
3.2. Determination of different VOx molecular structures
and their partitioning in V/MCM-41
A comparison of the in situ UVvis spectra of the
V/MCM-41 samples investigated is shown in Fig. 3. The
spectra were taken at 773 K in a flow of O2 (O2/N2 =
20:80). Under such conditions water is released from the
coordination sphere of V5+, leaving behind tetrahedrally co-
ordinated V5+. The spectra are essentially the same for all
dehydrated V/MCM-41 catalysts, with the exception of the
highly loaded V(11.2)/MCM-41 sample, which also con-
tains XRD-detectable crystalline V2O5 (Section 3.1, Fig. 2).
The absorption at 295 nm and its correspondingly high band-
gap energy value (Eg 3.4 eV) are characteristic of isolated
dehydrated surface VO4 species [22]. In order to derive more
precise insights into the structure of VOx species in low
loaded (5 wt%) V/MCM-41 samples, their UV/vis spec-
tra were compared with those of magnesium vanadates with
structures of Mg3V2O8 and Mg2V2O7, where isolated VO4
units and VOx species with VOV bonds, respectively,

are present. Fig. 4 compares these spectra. It is clear that
spectra of low loaded (5 wt%) V/MCM-41 samples dif-
fer from that of pure Mg3V2O8, but they are similar to that
of a mixture of Mg3V2O8 and Mg2V2O7. Taking into ac-
count these experimental observations, it is concluded that
both isolated VO4 units and small VOx aggregates that have
VOV bonds are present on the surface of the low loaded
(5 wt%) V/MCM-41 samples. Here the above VOx species
are referred to as highly dispersed. Increasing the vanadium
content to 11.2 wt% gives rise to a new broad UVvis band
between 400 and 600 nm, with a corresponding low band-
gap energy value (Eg 2.9 eV) characteristic of crystalline
V2O5 [23].
The in situ Raman spectra of the V/MCM-41 catalysts,
after dehydration at 723 K, are compared in Fig. 5. The
spectra in Figs. 5a and 5b were taken under 325 and 785-
nm excitation. The band at 477 cm1 originated from
vibrations of SiOSi rings of the MCM-41 support, and
the band at 1031 cm1 is associated with dehydrated,
highly dispersed surface O=V(OSi)3 species [2426].
However, recent theoretical and experimental studies on Ra-
man spectra of V/SiO2 provide an indication that the band at
1031 cm1 cannot be assigned to vanadyl species exclu-
sively [27]. Since no Raman band at 966 cm1 was iden-
tified, according to [28] the highly dispersed surface VOx
species are concluded to be in non-framework sites. The
absence of a sharp Raman band at 994 cm1, with its mul-
tiple associated sharp bands at lower wave numbers, demon-
strates that crystalline V2O5 nanoparticles are not present
in any of the V/MCM-41 samples with vanadium loadings
up to 5 wt%. This band was identified in V(11.2)/MCM-
41 only (Fig. 5). Since polymeric VOx species can eas-
ily be detected under visible excitation [28], in contrast to
isolated vanadyl species, Raman spectra of V(5.3)/MCM-
41 and V(11.2)/MCM-41 samples were collected at 785-
nm excitation. The respective spectra are given in Fig. 5b.
This figure shows nicely that crystalline V2O5 nanoparti-

cles in the V(11.2)/MCM-41 sample are strongly resonance-
enhanced under visible laser excitation. Since no signs of
the presence of crystalline V2O5 nanoparticles was found
in V(5.3)/MCM-41 even under visible laser excitation, it is
concluded that V/MCM-41 samples with vanadium loading
lower than 5.3 wt% are free of crystalline V2O5 nanoparti-
cles.
3.3. Redox properties
The in situ UVvis spectra obtained after reduction of
fully oxidized V(2.7)/MCM-41 by C3H8 or H2 at 773 K
are presented in Fig. 6. The intensity of the ligand-to-metal
charge transfer (LMCT) bands in the 200400-nm region
decreases upon exposure to the reducing C3H8 and H2 be-
cause of reduction of the V5+ to V4+ or V3+. The UVvis
bands for surface V4+ and/or V3+ species arise from dd
transitions and appear as broad and weak features in the
400700-nm region (note the nonzero value of the absorp-
tion for the reduced samples in this region) [22,29]. The
reduced samples were subjected to re-oxidation by oxygen.
The reduced surface VOx species are easily re-oxidized to
the surface V5+ species, but the re-oxidation is incomplete
for the chosen experimental conditions (see Fig. 6). Similar

results are also characteristic for all of the V/MCM-41 cata-
lysts.
The H2-TPR spectra of the V/MCM-41 materials are
shown in Fig. 7. T max, which qualitatively reflects the re-
ducibility of the supported vanadia, increases slightly from
778 to 793 K as the vanadium loading increases from 0.2 to
5.3 wt% for the samples prepared by the addition of vana-
dium during synthesis of MCM-41. For the impregnated
samples, T max is slightly higher and around 808 K. These
slight shifts to higher T max are a consequence of the higher
H2O partial pressures formed with higher V-loaded samples
that retard the reduction process. The single T max obtained
for all samples represents a single stage reduction of the sur-
face V5+ to surface V3+ [2931]. The H2-TPR profile for

tures.
V(11.2)/MCM-41 has an additional shoulder with a maxi-
mum shifted to higher temperatures due to the presence of
crystalline V2O5 nanoparticles in this sample. Higher T max
for crystalline V2O5 than for the surface VOx species arises
from the more difficult reduction of the internal V5+ sites in
the V2O5 crystalline lattice during H2-TPR.
3.4. Catalytic performance of V/MCM-41 materials with
O2 and N2O
C3H6, CO, and CO2 were the main reaction products,
with oxygen and nitrous oxide as oxidants in the ODP re-
action over the differently loaded and prepared V/MCM-41
catalytic materials. Very small amounts (<0.01 vol%) of
acetaldehyde and acrolein were also produced as reaction
by-products. V loading, method of catalyst preparation, and
the oxidant were examined for their influence on the rate
of propene formation (C3H6 mol/(min g)), with oxygen and
nitrous oxide as oxidants. The corresponding activity results
are plotted in Figs. 8a and 8b as a function of the V con-

tent and apparent V surface density, respectively. These re-
sults reveal that the activity for propene formation is higher
with O2 than with N2O for all vanadium loadings or surface
densities. Regardless of the oxidizing agent, the activity in-
creases with increasing vanadium loading up to 5.3 wt% (ca.
1 V/nm2). There is no significant difference in the rates of
propene formation for samples prepared by different meth-
ods. This indicates a similarity of VOx species in differently
prepared V/MCM-41 materials. To understand the intrinsic
activity of surface VOx species, we calculated the turnover
frequency (TOF) (presented in Fig. 9) according to Eq. (2).
The nearly constant TOF values for the catalysts with vana-
dium loadings of up to 5.3 wt% (V surface density is below
ca. 1 V/nm2) suggest that all of the surface VOx sites are
essentially identical. V(11.2)/MCM-41 has the lowest TOF
value because of formation of sintered V2O5 nanoparticles
(dispersion <100%). The catalytic ODP reaction is sensitive
to the specific oxidant, and lower TOF values were obtained
with N2O than with O2. This observation is discussed in de-
tail in Section 4.1.

The effect of vanadium loading and type of oxidant on
propene selectivity at a degree of propane conversion of ca.
2% is shown in Fig. 10. The selectivity increases slightly
with an increase in vanadium loading of up to 5.3 wt% and
decreases with a further increase in vanadium loading; the
selectivity maximum is difficult to define because of the lack
of experimental data. This is valid for catalytic tests with
both N2O and O2. However, for an N2O-containing mixture
this decrease is not as clear as that for an O2-containing re-
action feed. It should also be emphasized that the propene
selectivity with N2O is slightly higher over all of the cata-
lysts than that with O2. Further studies were made to under-
stand the reaction pathways for ODP; the ODP tests were
conducted with N2O and O2 at different contact times (i.e.,
different degrees of propane conversion). The selectivity
conversion relationships for different catalysts in the pres-
ence of O2 and N2O are compared in Fig. 11. The propene
selectivity decreases whereas CO and CO2 selectivities in-
crease with increasing propane conversion for both oxidants.
The relationship obtained indicates the secondary nature for
COx formation, that is, CO and CO2 are formed via consecu-
tive C3H6 oxidation. Taking into account this finding and the
non-zero CO and CO2 selectivities at near-zero C3H8 con-
version, it is suggested that both CO2 and CO can also be pri-
mary products of total propane oxidation. However, this re-
action pathway plays a significant role at low degrees (<2%)
of propane conversion only. The contribution of the con-
secutive C3H6 oxidation to total COx production increases
strongly with a progressive increase in C3H8 conversion and
prevails at high degrees. From a more detailed analysis of
the results in Fig. 11 it is concluded that CO formation is
more strongly influenced by the degree of C3H8 conver-
sion as compared with CO2 formation. For an O2-containing
feed, relative changes in CO selectivity over V(2.7)/MCM-

41, V(3.1)/MCM-41, and V(11.2)/MCM-41 are 13, 8, and
15% as C3H8 conversion is increased from 0.8 to 7.6, from
1.5 to 7.4, and from 2 to 7.5, respectively. The respective
changes in CO2 selectivity are 6, 5, and 2.7%. From a com-
parison of the relative changes in CO and CO2 selectivities,
it is obvious that CO selectivity as compared with that of
CO2 is a stronger function of the degree of C3H8 conver-
sion. Thus it is concluded that propene is largely oxidized
to CO as compared with CO2. The extent of the decrease
in propene selectivity, however, is smaller with N2O than
that with O2. For similar propane conversions, the selectiv-
ity for carbon oxides is ca. 23 times higher with O2 than
with N2O. The above observations suggest a complex reac-
tion scheme of parallel and consecutive steps for the ODP
reaction using either O2 or N2O; the scheme is presented in
Fig. 12.
4. Discussion
4.1. Nature of surface VOx species and their relationship
to the activity and selectivity in the ODP reaction
The results for materials characterization revealed that
highly dispersed surface VOx species are present in the sup-
ported V/MCM-41 catalysts up to 5 wt% V. These species
reside in extra-framework positions, since the characteristic
960 cm1 band typical for framework cations in siliceous
molecular sieves [28] is not observed for the supported
V/MCM-41 catalysts. The molecular structure of the surface
VOx species on MCM-41 is independent of the synthesis
method, since the same structure results from either incorpo-
ration of vanadium during the MCM-41 synthesis process or
by post-impregnation of the formed MCM-41 support with
vanadium (Section 3.2). This agrees well with previously
reported results on the characterization of V/MCM-41 [13,
32], V/MCM-48 [22], and V/HSM silica [33]. The Raman
spectra suggest that all of the vanadia species are located in
accessible surface sites, since these dehydrated sites read-
ily become hydrated upon exposure to ambient air [29]. The
V(11.2)/MCM-41 sample, however, consists of a collapsed
MCM-41 structure and crystalline V2O5 nanoparticles.
The experimental data showed that the catalytic perfor-
mance (i.e., activity and the relationship between propene
selectivity and propane conversion) of V/MCM-41 catalysts
in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane depends on the
distribution of VOx species on the catalyst surface and the
nature of the oxidant. From Fig. 10 it can be seen that the
propene selectivity at a propane conversion of ca. 2% in-
creases slightly with vanadium loadings up to 5.3 wt% for
both oxidants. The weak differences in C3H6 selectivity of
catalysts with low vanadium loadings (up to 5.3 wt%) is a
strong indication of the participation of surface VOx species
of the same nature in C3H8 activation yielding C3H6. This is
supported by the results from characterization techniques,
such as UVvis and Raman spectroscopy (Section 3.2),
which demonstrate the presence of highly dispersed surface
VOx in these samples. For V(11.2)/MCM-41, which pos-
sesses crystalline V2O5 nanoparticles (Section 3.2), there is
only a slight decrease in propene selectivity from ca. 90 to
85% when N2O is used, whereas for O2 there is a marked de-
crease from ca. 80 to 30% at comparable degrees of propane
conversion. A possible reason for these phenomena is pre-
sented and discussed in Section 4.2.
As shown in Fig. 8, the rate of C3H6 formation and the
TOF values are lower with N2O than with O2 as the oxidant.
This can be explained in the following way. It is commonly
accepted that the ODP reaction over vanadia-based cata-
lysts proceeds via a Marsvan Krevelen mechanism. This
mechanism suggests that C3H8 removes lattice oxygen from
VOx species, yielding C3H6, H2O, and a reduced VOx cen-
ter (Eq. (3)). Subsequently, the lattice oxygen is replenished
by gas-phase oxygen in a re-oxidation step (Eq. (4)). In the
case of N2O, the catalyst re-oxidation proceeds according to
Eq. (5). The reaction steps involved are assumed to be ir-
reversible. In our previous work on the ODP reaction over
VOx/γ -Al2O3, it was shown that the same oxygen species,
lattice oxygen of vanadia, is formed from O2 and N2O [20].

where [O] stands for the lattice oxygen of VOx and [ ] corre-
sponds to an anion vacancy after removal of lattice oxygen
from VOx species. Under steady-state conditions and in the
presence of O2 and N2O, the rate of C3H6 formation can be
described as follows:
(6)

C3H6 = kC3H8p(C3H8)

kC3H8p(C3H8)

.
In addition to the product of the C3H8 partial pressure and
the reaction constant of propane activation, Eqs. (6) and
(7) include a complex expression (squared brackets). Since
the product of the C3H8 partial pressure and the reaction
constant of propane activation is the same in Eqs. (6) and
140

(7), it cannot be responsible for differences in the rates
of C3H6 formation with O2 and N2O (Fig. 8). Therefore,
the expression in squared brackets contains information on
factors influencing the catalytic activity with both O2 and
N2O. The lower the denominator in this expression, the
higher is the rate of propene formation. Two experimental
facts should be taken into account: (i) kC3H8 is the same
for O2- and N2O-containing mixtures; and (ii) the ratios of
p(C3H8)/p(O2) and p(C3H8)/p(N2O) are 2 and 1, respec-
tively. From Eqs. (6) and (7) and the two above facts, a lower
reaction rate with O2 as compared with N2O would be ex-
pected if kN2O and kO2 were the same or kN2O were greater
than kO2. However, it would contradict the experimental ob-
servations in Figs. 8 and 9. Therefore, the lower rate of C3H6
formation in the presence of N2O as compared with that in
the presence of O2 is related to the lower ability of N2O to re-
oxidize the reduced surface VOx sites. Previously, this low
activity of N2O was experimentally proved for differently
loaded catalytic materials of the type VOx/γ -Al2O3 [20].
Taking this into account, the lower intrinsic activity (TOF)
of VOx species for C3H8 activation with N2O than with O2
(see Fig. 9) can be explained as follows. For the calcula-
tion of TOF values, the total number of vanadium atoms
(including those in the bulk) was used without consideration
of the fact that not vanadium atoms, but the lattice oxygen
of VOx species, participates in C3H8 activation. Accord-
ing to Eqs. (3)(7), the steady-state concentration of lattice
oxygen is a function of the rates of catalyst reduction and
re-oxidation. Since the rate of catalyst re-oxidation by N2O
is slower than that by O2, a lower steady-state concentra-
tion of lattice oxygen is expected to be responsible for C3H8
activation in the presence of N2O. Therefore, the TOF val-
ues presented in Fig. 9 do not reflect the discrepancy in the
intrinsic activity of VOx species for the ODP reaction with
O2 and N2O, but the difference in the ability of the catalyst
for its re-oxidation by different oxidants, that is, differences
in steady-state concentrations of lattice oxygen in the pres-
ence of two different oxidants. Thus, it is concluded that the
intrinsic activity of VOx species does not depend on the ox-
idant used, and the rate of re-oxidation by the oxidants is
responsible for the different ODP reactivities with O2 and
N2O.
4.2. Role of oxidant in selective and non-selective routes of
ODP
As shown in Section 3.4, the selectivity (distribution of
products) of the ODP reaction strongly depends on the na-
ture of the oxidant applied (Figs. 10 and 11). Although
propene is the main olefin with both N2O and O2, the
propene selectivity achieved is lower when O2 is used as the
oxidant as compared with N2O. Similar results were previ-
ously reported in [20] for the oxidative dehydrogenation of
propane over differently loaded VOx/γ -Al2O3 catalytic ma-
terials. Two important improving effects of N2O on the ODP
reaction should be especially emphasized: (i) a higher pri-
Fig. 13. Schematic presentation of the role of lattice oxygen isolation in
COx formation.
mary C3H6 selectivity is achieved, and (ii) the decrease in
C3H6 selectivity with increasing degree of propane conver-
sion is less marked.
This effect of the oxidant on the catalytic performance
can be associated with the activation of the oxidant. As dis-
cussed in Section 4.1, N2O re-oxidizes reduced VOx sites
more slowly as compared with O2, yielding a lower con-
centration of active lattice oxygen and, therefore, its lower
density. From the stoichiometric requirements of the ODP
reaction it is postulated that one selective catalyst site should
contain one to two active lattice-oxygen anions to obtain
the desired propene. Active sites with more than two active
lattice oxygen anions would favor the formation of waste
products (i.e., CO and CO2) by consecutive total oxidation
steps. Since several oxygen species are needed for COx for-
mation in contrast to C3H6 formation, the latter reaction
pathway prevails at low densities/concentrations of active
oxygen species. This is schematically illustrated in Fig. 13.
According to this figure, COx formation is favored at high
densities of active lattice oxygen in VOx surface species.
Such a situation occurs when the rate of catalyst re-oxidation
(Eqs. (4) and (5)) is faster than that of reduction (Eq. (3)).
As discussed in Section 4.1, N2O re-oxidizes reduced VOx
sites more slowly as compared with O2, yielding a lower
concentration of active lattice oxygen; that is, its surface
density is lower. This is particularly valid for V(11.2)/MCM-
41, since it has the highest surface density of lattice oxygen
in the presence of O2 and, respectively, the lowest propene
selectivity. The influence of the surface density of active lat-
tice oxygen in VOx species on propene selectivity is clearly
visible for this catalyst as compared with other materials
(Figs. 10 and 11). Thus, spatial separation of active lattice

oxygen anions from each other on the catalyst surface fa-
vors propene formation and simultaneously minimizes its
further oxidation to COx. Such a hypothesis of active site
isolation in selective oxidation of hydrocarbons was first
formulated and published by Callaham and Grasselli [34].
However, in the present discussion, it cannot be excluded
that in addition to lattice oxygen, adsorbed oxygen species
also participate in the oxidation of surface intermediates to
COx, as recently shown for a complex mixed-oxide cata-
lyst [35]. In this case, active sites containing one to two
lattice oxygen anions may become active for COx forma-
tion, if additional adsorbed oxygen species are formed in the
vicinity of these selective active sites. A detailed understand-
ing of the role of adsorbed oxygen species is still needed and
is currently being worked on.
5. Summary and conclusions
The findings from the present investigation can be sum-
marized as follows:
1. Combination of the characterization results obtained by
different techniques (TEM, TPR, in situ UV/vis DRS,
and Raman spectroscopy) for vanadia supported on
high-surface-area mesoporous MCM-41 reveals that the
nature and distribution of VOx species do not depend
on vanadium loading up to at least 5.3 wt%. In these
samples the VOx surface species are highly dispersed
as monomeric and small surface VOx clusters under
conditions of the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane
(ODP). Crystalline V2O5 nanoparticles are formed on
V/MCM-41 with 11.2 wt% vanadium when the meso-
porous structure collapses.
2. Regardless of vanadium loading (up to 5.3 wt%), the
highly dispersed surface VOx species show similar in-
trinsic catalytic activity. However, the measured activity
of these species is lower when N2O is used as the oxi-
dant, in comparison with O2. The difference is due to the
lower ability of N2O to re-oxidize reduced VOx species
rather than re-oxidation by O2.
3. In contrast to highly dispersed surface VOx species, the
crystalline V2O5 nanoparticles are not selective when
O2 is used as the oxidant. However, in the presence of
N2O, there is no strong difference in propene selectivity.
4. For all of the V/MCM-41 materials, the use of N2O
instead of O2 favors selective propane oxidation to
propene over the total combustion of propane or propene.
The improving effect of N2O is related to site isolation
of the active surface lattice oxygen species; thereby the
direct deep propane and consecutive propene oxidation
to COx is inhibited.
5. For catalyst design it appears important to ascertain a
high dispersion of the reducible metal oxides (MeOx)
on an inert support. These metal oxides should be easily
reduced by hydrocarbon rather than re-oxidized by an
oxidant. This will spatially isolate active lattice oxygen
species in MeOx aggregates favoring selective oxida-
tion over a combustion reaction. With respect to process
design, it is well known that N2O is also a suitable oxi-
dant for selective benzene oxidation to phenol. Whether
such a process operation can be also applied to selective
alkane oxidation remains to be seen. Moreover, activ-
ity and selectivity improvements need to be made, the
availability of N2O in sufficient quantities has to be as-
certained, and, finally, process economics must be stud-
ied.
