[1] "It is commonly accepted that the ODP reaction over vanadia-based catalysts proceeds via a Mars–van Krevelen mechanism. This mechanism suggests that C3H8 removes lattice oxygen from VOx species, yielding C3H6, H2O, and a reduced VOx center (Eq. (3)). Subsequently, the lattice oxygen is replenished by gas-phase oxygen in a re-oxidation step (Eq. (4))."

[2] "For the calculation of TOF values, the total number of vanadium atoms (including those in the bulk) was used without consideration of the fact that not vanadium atoms, but the lattice oxygen of VOx species, participates in C3H8 activation."

[3] "Since several oxygen species are needed for COx formation in contrast to C3H6 formation, the latter reaction pathway prevails at low densities/concentrations of active oxygen species."

[4] "N2O re-oxidizes reduced VOx sites more slowly as compared with O2, yielding a lower concentration of active lattice oxygen and, therefore, its lower density."

The literature does not directly compare and contrast the mechanisms of C-H bond activation and catalyst regeneration for redox-active and redox-inactive metal oxide catalysts in oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes. It also does not discuss the role of CO2 as an oxidant or the effectiveness of different catalysts like CeO2 and transition metal clusters in activating CO2 for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane.

However, the document does provide some insights into the mechanism for vanadia-based catalysts, which are redox-active:

1. C-H bond activation: For vanadia-based catalysts, the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODP) proceeds via a Mars-van Krevelen mechanism. In this process, propane removes lattice oxygen from VOx species, resulting in the formation of propene, water, and a reduced VOx center.

2. Catalyst regeneration: After the C-H activation step, the lattice oxygen is replenished by gas-phase oxygen in a re-oxidation step. The rate of this re-oxidation affects the overall catalytic performance.

3. Role of oxidants: The study compares O2 and N2O as oxidants. N2O re-oxidizes reduced VOx sites more slowly than O2, resulting in a lower concentration and density of active lattice oxygen. This leads to higher propene selectivity with N2O compared to O2.

4. Selectivity considerations: The formation of COx requires several oxygen species, while C3H6 formation requires fewer. Therefore, lower densities/concentrations of active oxygen species favor propene formation over COx formation.

The document does not provide information on redox-inactive catalysts, CO2 as an oxidant, or the effectiveness of other catalysts like CeO2 and transition metal clusters in activating CO2 for ODP. Therefore, a comprehensive comparison of these aspects cannot be made based on the given literature.

该文献并未直接比较和对比氧化还原活性和氧化还原惰性金属氧化物催化剂在烷烃氧化脱氢中的C-H键活化和催化剂再生机制。它也没有讨论CO2作为氧化剂的作用，或者CeO2和过渡金属簇等不同催化剂在活化CO2用于丙烷氧化脱氢方面的有效性。

然而，该文档确实提供了一些关于钒基催化剂（属于氧化还原活性催化剂）机制的见解：

1. C-H键活化：对于钒基催化剂，丙烷的氧化脱氢（ODP）通过Mars-van Krevelen机制进行。在这个过程中，丙烷从VOx物种中移除晶格氧，生成丙烯、水和还原态的VOx中心。

2. 催化剂再生：在C-H活化步骤之后，晶格氧通过气相氧在再氧化步骤中得到补充。这种再氧化的速率影响整体催化性能。

3. 氧化剂的作用：该研究比较了O2和N2O作为氧化剂。N2O比O2更慢地再氧化还原态的VOx位点，导致活性晶格氧的浓度和密度较低。这使得使用N2O时的丙烯选择性高于使用O2时。

4. 选择性考虑：COx的形成需要多个氧物种，而C3H6的形成需要的氧物种较少。因此，较低密度/浓度的活性氧物种有利于丙烯的形成而不是COx的形成。

该文档没有提供关于氧化还原惰性催化剂、CO2作为氧化剂，或其他催化剂如CeO2和过渡金属簇在活化CO2用于ODP方面的有效性的信息。因此，基于给定的文献无法对这些方面进行全面的比较。
