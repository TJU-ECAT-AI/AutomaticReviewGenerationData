[1] "It is commonly accepted that the ODP reaction over vanadia-based catalysts proceeds via a Mars–van Krevelen mechanism. This mechanism suggests that C3H8 removes lattice oxygen from VOx species, yielding C3H6, H2O, and a reduced VOx center (Eq. (3)). Subsequently, the lattice oxygen is replenished by gas-phase oxygen in a re-oxidation step (Eq. (4))."

[2] "Since the rate of catalyst re-oxidation by N2O is slower than that by O2, a lower steady-state concentration of lattice oxygen is expected to be responsible for C3H8 activation in the presence of N2O."

[3] "From the stoichiometric requirements of the ODP reaction it is postulated that one selective catalyst site should contain one to two active lattice-oxygen anions to obtain the desired propene. Active sites with more than two active lattice oxygen anions would favor the formation of waste products (i.e., CO and CO2) by consecutive total oxidation steps."

The literature does not directly compare and contrast the mechanisms of C-H bond activation and catalyst regeneration for redox-active and redox-inactive metal oxide catalysts in oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes. It also does not discuss the role of CO2 as an oxidant or the effectiveness of different catalysts like CeO2 or transition metal clusters in activating CO2 for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane.

However, the document does provide some insights into the mechanism of oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODP) over vanadia-based catalysts:

1. The reaction proceeds via a Mars-van Krevelen mechanism, where propane removes lattice oxygen from VOx species to form propene, water, and a reduced VOx center. The catalyst is then re-oxidized by gas-phase oxygen.

2. The rate of catalyst re-oxidation affects the steady-state concentration of lattice oxygen, which in turn influences the catalyst's activity and selectivity. For example, N2O re-oxidizes the catalyst more slowly than O2, resulting in a lower concentration of lattice oxygen and higher propene selectivity.

3. The number of active lattice-oxygen anions at a catalyst site influences the product distribution. Sites with one to two oxygen anions favor propene formation, while sites with more than two oxygen anions promote total oxidation to CO and CO2.

The document does not provide information on CO2 activation or its use as an oxidant in ODP reactions, nor does it discuss other catalysts like CeO2 or transition metal clusters.

该文献并未直接比较和对比氧化还原活性和非活性金属氧化物催化剂在烷烃氧化脱氢中C-H键活化和催化剂再生的机制。它也没有讨论CO2作为氧化剂的作用，或不同催化剂如CeO2或过渡金属簇在活化CO2用于丙烷氧化脱氢方面的效果。

然而，该文档确实提供了一些关于钒基催化剂上丙烷氧化脱氢（ODP）反应机理的见解：

1. 该反应通过Mars-van Krevelen机制进行，其中丙烷从VOx物种中移除晶格氧以形成丙烯、水和还原的VOx中心。然后催化剂被气相氧再氧化。

2. 催化剂再氧化的速率影响晶格氧的稳态浓度，进而影响催化剂的活性和选择性。例如，N2O比O2更慢地再氧化催化剂，导致更低的晶格氧浓度和更高的丙烯选择性。

3. 催化剂位点上活性晶格氧阴离子的数量影响产物分布。具有一到两个氧阴离子的位点有利于丙烯的形成，而具有两个以上氧阴离子的位点促进完全氧化生成CO和CO2。

该文档没有提供关于CO2活化或其在ODP反应中作为氧化剂使用的信息，也没有讨论其他催化剂如CeO2或过渡金属簇。
