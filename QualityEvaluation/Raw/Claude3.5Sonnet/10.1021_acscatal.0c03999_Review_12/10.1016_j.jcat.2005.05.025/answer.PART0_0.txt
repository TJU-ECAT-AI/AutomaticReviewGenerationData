[1] "It is commonly accepted that the ODP reaction over vanadia-based catalysts proceeds via a Mars–van Krevelen mechanism. This mechanism suggests that C3H8 removes lattice oxygen from VOx species, yielding C3H6, H2O, and a reduced VOx center (Eq. (3)). Subsequently, the lattice oxygen is replenished by gas-phase oxygen in a re-oxidation step (Eq. (4))."

[2] "Since the rate of catalyst re-oxidation by N2O is slower than that by O2, a lower steady-state concentration of lattice oxygen is expected to be responsible for C3H8 activation in the presence of N2O."

[3] "From the stoichiometric requirements of the ODP reaction it is postulated that one selective catalyst site should contain one to two active lattice-oxygen anions to obtain the desired propene. Active sites with more than two active lattice oxygen anions would favor the formation of waste products (i.e., CO and CO2) by consecutive total oxidation steps."

The literature does not directly compare redox-active and redox-inactive metal oxide catalysts or discuss CO2 as an oxidant for oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes. However, it does provide some insights into the mechanism for vanadium-based catalysts:

For redox-active catalysts like vanadium oxides, the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane proceeds via a Mars-van Krevelen mechanism. This involves:

1. C-H bond activation: Propane removes lattice oxygen from the VOx species, producing propene, water, and reduced VOx.

2. Catalyst regeneration: Gas-phase oxygen (O2 or N2O) re-oxidizes the reduced VOx, replenishing the lattice oxygen.

The effectiveness of the oxidant impacts the reaction:

- O2 re-oxidizes the catalyst more quickly than N2O, leading to higher activity but potentially lower selectivity due to over-oxidation.
- N2O re-oxidizes more slowly, resulting in lower activity but higher propene selectivity due to a lower density of active lattice oxygen species.

The literature does not discuss CO2 activation or other catalysts like CeO2 or transition metal clusters for this reaction. To fully answer the question, additional information on redox-inactive catalysts, CO2 activation, and other catalyst types would be needed.

该文献没有直接比较氧化还原活性和非活性金属氧化物催化剂，也没有讨论CO2作为烷烃氧化脱氢的氧化剂。然而，它确实提供了一些关于钒基催化剂机理的见解：

对于钒氧化物等氧化还原活性催化剂，丙烷的氧化脱氢通过Mars-van Krevelen机理进行。这包括：

1. C-H键活化：丙烷从VOx物种中移除晶格氧，产生丙烯、水和还原的VOx。

2. 催化剂再生：气相氧（O2或N2O）重新氧化还原的VOx，补充晶格氧。

氧化剂的有效性影响反应：

- O2比N2O更快地重新氧化催化剂，导致活性更高，但由于过度氧化可能导致选择性较低。
- N2O重新氧化较慢，导致活性较低但丙烯选择性较高，这是由于活性晶格氧物种密度较低。

文献没有讨论CO2的活化或其他催化剂如CeO2或过渡金属簇对这个反应的影响。要全面回答这个问题，还需要有关氧化还原非活性催化剂、CO2活化和其他类型催化剂的额外信息。
