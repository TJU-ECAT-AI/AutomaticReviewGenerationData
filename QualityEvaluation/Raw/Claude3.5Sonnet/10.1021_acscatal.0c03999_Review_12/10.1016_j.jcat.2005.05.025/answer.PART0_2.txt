[1] "It is commonly accepted that the ODP reaction over vanadia-based catalysts proceeds via a Mars–van Krevelen mechanism. This mechanism suggests that C3H8 removes lattice oxygen from VOx species, yielding C3H6, H2O, and a reduced VOx center (Eq. (3)). Subsequently, the lattice oxygen is replenished by gas-phase oxygen in a re-oxidation step (Eq. (4))."

[2] "Since the rate of catalyst re-oxidation by N2O is slower than that by O2, a lower steady-state concentration of lattice oxygen is expected to be responsible for C3H8 activation in the presence of N2O."

[3] "From the stoichiometric requirements of the ODP reaction it is postulated that one selective catalyst site should contain one to two active lattice-oxygen anions to obtain the desired propene. Active sites with more than two active lattice oxygen anions would favor the formation of waste products (i.e., CO and CO2) by consecutive total oxidation steps."

The literature does not directly compare redox-active and redox-inactive metal oxide catalysts for oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of alkanes. However, it does discuss the mechanism for vanadium-based catalysts, which are redox-active.

For redox-active catalysts like vanadium oxides, the ODH reaction proceeds via a Mars-van Krevelen mechanism. In this process, propane removes lattice oxygen from VOx species, producing propene, water, and reduced VOx. The catalyst is then regenerated by gas-phase oxygen, which replenishes the lattice oxygen.

The literature does not discuss CO2 as an oxidant for ODH. It compares O2 and N2O, noting that N2O is a weaker oxidant that re-oxidizes the catalyst more slowly than O2. This results in a lower steady-state concentration of active lattice oxygen, which can improve selectivity towards propene by reducing over-oxidation to COx.

The document does not provide information on CeO2 or transition metal clusters for CO2 activation in ODH of propane. It also does not discuss energy barriers for CO2 dissociation or proposed mechanisms for CO2 activation on different catalysts.

The literature suggests that catalyst design should aim for high dispersion of reducible metal oxides on inert supports, with the metal oxides being more easily reduced by hydrocarbons than re-oxidized by the oxidant. This approach spatially isolates active lattice oxygen species, favoring selective oxidation over combustion reactions.

这篇文献没有直接比较氧化还原活性和非活性金属氧化物催化剂在烷烃氧化脱氢(ODH)中的作用。但是,它确实讨论了钒基催化剂(氧化还原活性催化剂)的反应机理。

对于像钒氧化物这样的氧化还原活性催化剂,ODH反应是通过Mars-van Krevelen机理进行的。在这个过程中,丙烷从VOx物种中移除晶格氧,生成丙烯、水和还原态的VOx。然后催化剂被气相氧再生,补充晶格氧。

文献没有讨论CO2作为ODH的氧化剂。它比较了O2和N2O,指出N2O是一种较弱的氧化剂,比O2更慢地再氧化催化剂。这导致活性晶格氧的稳态浓度较低,可以通过减少过氧化到COx来提高对丙烯的选择性。

该文档没有提供关于CeO2或过渡金属簇在丙烷ODH中活化CO2的信息。它也没有讨论CO2解离的能量障碍或不同催化剂上CO2活化的proposed机理。

文献建议,催化剂设计应该在惰性载体上高度分散可还原的金属氧化物,使金属氧化物更容易被烃类还原而不是被氧化剂再氧化。这种方法可以使活性晶格氧物种空间隔离,有利于选择性氧化而不是燃烧反应。
