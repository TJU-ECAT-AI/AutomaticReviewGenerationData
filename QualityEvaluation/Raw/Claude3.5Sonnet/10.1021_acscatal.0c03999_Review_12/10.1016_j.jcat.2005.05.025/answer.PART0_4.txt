[1] "It is commonly accepted that the ODP reaction over vanadia-based catalysts proceeds via a Mars–van Krevelen mechanism. This mechanism suggests that C3H8 removes lattice oxygen from VOx species, yielding C3H6, H2O, and a reduced VOx center (Eq. (3)). Subsequently, the lattice oxygen is replenished by gas-phase oxygen in a re-oxidation step (Eq. (4))."

[2] "Since the rate of catalyst re-oxidation by N2O is slower than that by O2, a lower steady-state concentration of lattice oxygen is expected to be responsible for C3H8 activation in the presence of N2O."

[3] "From the stoichiometric requirements of the ODP reaction it is postulated that one selective catalyst site should contain one to two active lattice-oxygen anions to obtain the desired propene. Active sites with more than two active lattice oxygen anions would favor the formation of waste products (i.e., CO and CO2) by consecutive total oxidation steps."

The literature does not directly compare redox-active and redox-inactive metal oxide catalysts or discuss CO2 as an oxidant for oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes. However, it does provide insights into the mechanism for vanadium-based catalysts:

For redox-active catalysts like vanadium oxides, the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane proceeds via a Mars-van Krevelen mechanism. This involves:

1. C-H bond activation: Propane removes lattice oxygen from VOx species, producing propene, water, and reduced VOx.

2. Catalyst regeneration: Gas-phase oxygen (O2 or N2O) replenishes the lattice oxygen.

The effectiveness of the catalyst depends on the balance between these steps. Using N2O instead of O2 leads to slower re-oxidation and lower steady-state concentration of lattice oxygen. This results in higher propene selectivity by limiting over-oxidation to CO and CO2.

The literature does not discuss CO2 activation or other catalysts like CeO2 or transition metal clusters for propane dehydrogenation. It focuses solely on vanadium-based catalysts with O2 and N2O as oxidants.

该文献没有直接比较氧化还原活性和非氧化还原活性的金属氧化物催化剂,也没有讨论CO2作为烷烃氧化脱氢的氧化剂。然而,它确实提供了关于钒基催化剂机理的见解:

对于钒氧化物等氧化还原活性催化剂,丙烷的氧化脱氢通过Mars-van Krevelen机理进行。这包括:

1. C-H键活化:丙烷从VOx物种中移除晶格氧,产生丙烯、水和还原的VOx。

2. 催化剂再生:气相氧(O2或N2O)补充晶格氧。

催化剂的有效性取决于这些步骤之间的平衡。使用N2O代替O2会导致再氧化速度较慢,晶格氧的稳态浓度较低。这通过限制过度氧化成CO和CO2来提高丙烯选择性。

该文献没有讨论CO2的活化或其他催化剂(如CeO2或过渡金属簇)用于丙烷脱氢。它仅关注使用O2和N2O作为氧化剂的钒基催化剂。
