[1] "Compared to state-of-the-art chemical production technologies, we illustrate that chemical looping offers significant opportunities for process intensification and exergy loss minimization. In many cases, an order of magnitude reduction in energy consumption and CO2 emission can be realized without the needs for carbon dioxide capture."

[2] "ODH of light alkanes"

[3] "In addition to providing various CLBC examples, this article elaborates on generalized design principles for CLBC, potential benefits and pitfalls, as well as redox catalyst selection, design, optimization, and redox reaction mechanism."

The provided literature does not contain sufficient information to fully answer the question about comparing and contrasting the mechanisms of C-H bond activation and catalyst regeneration in oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes for different types of metal oxide catalysts. The document mentions oxidative dehydrogenation of light alkanes as an application of chemical looping beyond combustion, but it does not go into detail about specific mechanisms, catalysts, or the role of CO2 as an oxidant.

The literature appears to be more focused on providing an overview of chemical looping beyond combustion (CLBC) and its potential benefits in terms of process intensification and emission reduction. It mentions that the article discusses redox catalyst selection, design, optimization, and reaction mechanisms, but the specific details requested in the question are not present in the given excerpt.

To properly answer this question, more detailed information about the specific catalysts, their mechanisms, and the role of CO2 in oxidative dehydrogenation would be needed.

提供的文献不包含足够的信息来全面回答关于不同类型金属氧化物催化剂在烷烃氧化脱氢过程中C-H键活化和催化剂再生机制的比较和对比问题。文档提到了轻烷烃的氧化脱氢作为化学链循环燃烧以外的应用，但没有详细讨论具体机制、催化剂或CO2作为氧化剂的作用。

这篇文献似乎更多地关注于概述化学链循环燃烧以外的应用(CLBC)及其在过程强化和减排方面的潜在益处。它提到文章讨论了氧化还原催化剂的选择、设计、优化和反应机制，但问题中要求的具体细节在给定的摘录中并不存在。

要正确回答这个问题，需要更多关于特定催化剂、它们的机制以及CO2在氧化脱氢中的作用的详细信息。
