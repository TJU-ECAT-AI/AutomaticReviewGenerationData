[1] "Compared to state-of-the-art chemical production technologies, we illustrate that chemical looping offers significant opportunities for process intensification and exergy loss minimization."

[2] "Facilitated by a redox catalyst, a rationally designed chemical looping scheme can reduce the number of unit operations and significantly decrease the exergy loss for chemical production."

[3] "ODH of light alkanes"

[4] "In some cases, the chemical looping strategy can facilitate a chemical conversion that would be otherwise infeasible in a conventional reaction scheme."

The provided literature does not contain specific information to fully answer the question about comparing and contrasting the mechanisms of C-H bond activation and catalyst regeneration in oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes for different types of metal oxide catalysts. The document lacks detailed explanations of the role of traditional oxidants and CO2, as well as discussions on the effectiveness of specific catalysts like V2O5, VOx/SiO2, CeO2, and transition metal clusters in activating CO2 for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane.

The literature mentions chemical looping and its potential for process intensification and exergy loss minimization in chemical production. It also briefly mentions oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of light alkanes as one of the applications of chemical looping beyond combustion. However, it does not provide the specific mechanistic details or comparisons requested in the question.

Given the limited information available in the provided text, a comprehensive answer to the question cannot be formulated based solely on this literature.

所提供的文献不包含足够的具体信息来全面回答关于不同类型金属氧化物催化剂在烷烃氧化脱氢中C-H键活化和催化剂再生机理的比较和对比问题。该文档缺乏对传统氧化剂和CO2作用的详细解释，也没有讨论V2O5、VOx/SiO2、CeO2和过渡金属簇等特定催化剂在活化CO2用于丙烷氧化脱氢方面的有效性。

文献提到了化学链循环及其在化学生产中实现过程强化和减少能量损失的潜力。它还简要提到了轻烷烃的氧化脱氢(ODH)作为超越燃烧的化学链循环应用之一。然而，它并未提供问题中要求的具体机理细节或比较。

鉴于提供的文本中可用信息有限，无法仅基于该文献来formulate一个全面的答案。
