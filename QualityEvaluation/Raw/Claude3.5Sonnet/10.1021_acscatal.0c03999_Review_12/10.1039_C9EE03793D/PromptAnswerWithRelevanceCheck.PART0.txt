The provided literature does not contain specific information to fully answer the question about comparing and contrasting the mechanisms of C-H bond activation and catalyst regeneration in oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes for different types of metal oxide catalysts. The document lacks detailed explanations of the role of traditional oxidants and CO2, as well as discussions on the effectiveness of specific catalysts like V2O5, VOx/SiO2, CeO2, and transition metal clusters in activating CO2 for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane.

The literature mentions chemical looping and its potential for process intensification and exergy loss minimization in chemical production. It also briefly mentions oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of light alkanes as one of the applications of chemical looping beyond combustion. However, it does not provide the specific mechanistic details or comparisons requested in the question.

Given the limited information available in the provided text, a comprehensive answer to the question cannot be formulated based solely on this literature.

The document does not provide sufficient information to fully answer the question about the mechanisms of C-H bond activation and catalyst regeneration in oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes for different types of metal oxide catalysts. It also lacks specific details on the effectiveness of various catalysts like V2O5, VOx/SiO2, CeO2, and transition metal clusters in activating CO2 for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane.

The document mentions oxidative dehydrogenation of light alkanes and epoxidation of olefins as examples of chemical looping beyond combustion (CLBC) processes, but does not delve into the specific mechanisms or compare different catalysts. It emphasizes the potential of CLBC to reduce exergy loss and the number of unit operations in chemical production, as well as the importance of rational design of redox catalysts. However, it does not provide the detailed mechanistic information or comparisons requested in the question.

To fully address the question, more specific information on reaction mechanisms, catalyst behaviors, and comparative studies would be needed. The document appears to be a broader overview of CLBC rather than a detailed examination of specific reaction mechanisms or catalyst comparisons for oxidative dehydrogenation reactions.
