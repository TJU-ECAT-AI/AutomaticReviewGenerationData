1. Mechanisms of C-H bond activation, catalyst regeneration, and oxidant utilization in oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes, with a focus on metal oxide catalysts and CO2 as an alternative oxidant

The mechanisms of C-H bond activation and catalyst regeneration in oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of alkanes differ significantly between redox-active and redox-inactive metal oxide catalysts. This review focuses on these mechanisms, emphasizing the role of traditional oxidants and CO2, and the effectiveness of various catalysts in activating CO2 for propane ODH.

Redox-active catalysts, such as V2O5, VOx/SiO2, and Cr2O3, typically operate via a Mars-van Krevelen (MvK) mechanism [10.1016/S0920-5861(03)00268-2]. In this process, lattice oxygen participates in C-H bond activation, forming alkenes and reducing the metal center. The catalyst is then regenerated by re-oxidation with gas-phase oxidants [10.1021/jp810664u]. For traditional oxidants like O2, this re-oxidation is rapid and keeps the catalyst in a highly oxidized state. When using CO2 as an oxidant, the mechanism involves a two-step process: first, the catalyst dehydrogenates the alkane, producing H2; then, H2 reduces CO2 to CO through the reverse water-gas shift (RWGS) reaction, regenerating the catalyst [10.1002/anie.201508128].

In contrast, redox-inactive catalysts like CeO2 and Ga2O3 operate through different mechanisms. They activate C-H bonds through acid-base interactions or heterolytic dissociation, without involving changes in metal oxidation states [10.1038/s41570-019-0128-9]. For these catalysts, CO2 activation often occurs separately from the C-H activation step.

The effectiveness of different catalysts in activating CO2 for ODH of propane varies:

1. V2O5 and VOx/SiO2: These catalysts show moderate activity in CO2 activation. On pure V2O5, the barrier for CO2 to oxidize VIII sites is high (3.16 eV), while on VOx/SiO2, the barrier is lower but still significant (1.76 eV) [10.1021/acscatal.0c03999_12].

2. CeO2-based catalysts: These are considered highly promising due to their ability to activate CO2 via direct C=O bond scission. The CeO2 (110) surface with oxygen vacancies shows a lower barrier for CO2 dissociation (1.36 eV) compared to vanadium-based catalysts [10.1021/acscatal.0c03999_12] [10.1039/D0CY00586J].

3. Transition metal clusters: Some systems, like Ni4/MgO, show very low barriers for CO2 dissociation (0.35 eV), making them highly effective in activating CO2 [10.1021/acscatal.0c03999_12].

4. Bimetallic catalysts: Fe-Ni and Ni-Pt catalysts supported on CeO2 show promise in CO2-assisted ODH. The Fe-Ni surface favors C-H bond activation, while Pt-containing surfaces tend to promote C-C bond cleavage [10.1038/s41467-018-03793-w].

CO2 as an oxidant offers several advantages over traditional oxidants like O2. It acts as a milder oxidant, suppressing over-oxidation and minimizing carbon oxide production [10.1038/s41467-018-03793-w]. For vanadium-based catalysts, CO2 can oxidize V2O3 to V2O4, but not to V2O5, leading to higher selectivity towards propylene and reduced carbon formation [10.1016/j.jcat.2015.12.015].

The effectiveness of these catalysts in CO2-assisted ODH depends on their ability to activate both CO2 and the alkane substrate while maintaining selectivity towards the desired alkene product. The energy barriers for CO2 dissociation and C-H bond activation play crucial roles in determining catalyst performance.

Integrative understanding and prospective outlook: The field of CO2-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes presents exciting opportunities for sustainable chemical production. The use of CO2 as a soft oxidant not only provides a pathway for CO2 utilization but also offers improved selectivity in alkane conversion. Future research directions may include:

1. Rational design of multi-component catalysts: Combining the CO2 activation ability of CeO2 with the selective C-H activation properties of transition metals could lead to highly efficient catalysts. Exploring novel combinations of metals and supports may yield synergistic effects that further lower energy barriers for both CO2 dissociation and alkane activation.

2. In-situ characterization techniques: Developing advanced spectroscopic methods to study the catalyst surface under reaction conditions could provide deeper insights into the reaction mechanisms and the nature of active sites. This could help bridge the gap between theoretical predictions and experimental observations.

3. Computational screening: High-throughput computational studies could be employed to predict the performance of a wide range of catalyst compositions, guiding experimental efforts towards the most promising systems.

4. Process intensification: Exploring innovative reactor designs or coupling CO2-assisted ODH with other reactions (e.g., RWGS) in a single process could improve overall efficiency and economics.

5. Expanding to other alkanes: While much focus has been on ethane and propane, investigating the applicability of CO2-assisted ODH to higher alkanes or cyclic hydrocarbons could open new avenues for valuable chemical production.

By addressing these research directions, we can work towards developing more efficient and sustainable processes for alkane conversion, contributing to the broader goals of CO2 utilization and green chemistry.
