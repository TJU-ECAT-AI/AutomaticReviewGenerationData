Abstract 
Commercial heterogeneous NiMo/Al2O3 catalyst was tested for the oxidative 
dehydrogenation (ODH) reaction of n-butane with different oxidant species: O2, CO2 and 
N2O. The effect of the lattice oxygen mobility and storage in NiMo/Al2O3 on catalytic 
conversion performance was investigated. Experiments indicated that a high O2-
storing/release is beneficial for activity, however at the expense of selectivity. A significant 
amount of butadiene with no oxygenated compound products was formed upon using 
carbon dioxide and nitrous oxide, while O2 favoured the formation of cracked hydrocarbon 
chains and COx. The highest turnover yield to 1,3-butadiene was achieved at the oxidant-to-
butane molar ratio of 2:1 at the temperatures of 350 C and 450 C. With CO2, significant 
amounts of hydrogen and carbon monoxide were evolving due to parallel reforming 
pathway. A partial nickel/molybdenum oxidation was also observed under CO2 and N2O 
atmospheres. TPR revealed the transformation of the high valence oxides into structurally 
distinct metal sub-oxides. In TPRO, three distinct peaks were visible and ascribed to 
surface oxygen sites and two framework positions. With N2O, these shifted towards lower 
temperature region, indicating a better diffusional accessibility and an easier bulk-to-
surface migration. XRD revealed α-NiMoO4 active phase presence, which was used in DFT 
modelling as (110) plane. Theoretical ab initio calculations elucidated fundamentally 
different reactive chemical intermediates when using CO2/N2O or O2 as oxidant. The 
former promote Mo atom oxygen termination, while in O2 environment, Ni is also 
oxygenated. Consequently, CO2 and N2O selectively dehydrogenate C4H10 through serial 
hydrogen abstraction: butane  butyl  1-butene  1-butene-3-nyl  butadiene. With 
O2, butane is firstly transformed into butanol and butanal, which are prone to subsequent 
CC bond cleavage. The latter is mirrored in different mechanisms and rate-determining 
steps, which are essential for efficient butadiene monomer process productivity and the 
optimisation thereof.

1 Introduction 
One of main tasks of chemical industry today is production of large amounts of organic 
compounds 1. Mono-olefins and di-olefins (butenes, butadiene, etc.) are extensively used in 
various chemical processes for production of synthetic resins, plastics, and other valuable 
products 2, 3. Nowadays, it is desirable to find substitute procedures for production of these 
compounds from more economically suitable raw materials and with smaller impact for the 
environment 4. The major industrial process for production of mono-olefins and di-olefins has 
a drawback of producing other raw materials, such as ethylene, propylene, and isobutene in 
high quantities 5, 6. Direct dehydrogenation of n-butane is an endothermic reaction that 
requires relatively high temperature in order to obtain high yields of butenes and butadiene 7. 
High reaction temperature favours thermal cracking reactions, production of lower alkanes 
and coke formation, resulting in decreased product yield and catalyst deactivation 8. On the 
other hand, oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of n-butane usually gives a lower yield of coke 
and cracking products because the reaction is exothermic 9, 10.  
Recent studies have focused on ODH of n-butane for producing butenes and butadiene (BD) 2, 
7, 8, 11. ODH of butenes can efficiently produce BD in high yields 9, 12. Molybdenum-based 
catalysts have been widely used for many selective oxidation reactions, especially the 
oxidation of butanes to butadiene 13. In particular, NiMoO4 shows potential for ODH of 
lighter paraffins, ethane, propane and n-butane 8, 14.  
Recently, metal molybdates have been proposed as selective catalysts for oxy-
dehydrogenation reactions 15, 16, although they show lower catalytic activity than the 
vanadium-containing catalysts 17, 18. On the other hand, the ODH of short-chain alkanes on V-
containing catalysts has been demonstrated to depend on the nature of the support 13, 19. Basic 
supports seem to be preferable for n-butane or propane 7, 8, 13 , whereas acid supports are more 
appropriate for obtaining ethylene from ethane 20, 21. In all cases, γ-Al2O3 (with a surface area 
ranging 150210 m2/g) was used 22, 23. Mesoporous alumina was used as support for 
vanadium oxide in the ODH of ethane 19, 22, showing high productivity towards ethylene as a 
consequence of a remarkable dispersion of vanadium on the support surface. However, an 
even better metal dispersion can be achieved using γ-Al2O3 as support 8, 12, 16, 18, 24, which 
makes it more interesting for use in ODH of n-butane.  
To the best of our knowledge, only ODH of butane using O2 or air as an oxidant has been 
reported in the literature and patents 5, 25. Due to the strong oxidative capacity of oxygen, the

reported BD selectivity is not as high as desired. CO2 and N2O have been reported as soft 
oxidants for ODH of light alkanes 26, 27. The use of these soft oxidants has several benefits 
over molecular oxygen, such as minimising the total oxidation reaction, further improving the 
selectivity towards partially oxidized products, increasing the process safety by reducing the 
explosion risk and using up N2O and CO2, which are major greenhouse gases in the 
atmosphere 4, 26, 27. Recently, Fe2O3/Al2O3 catalysts have been used for ODH of 1-butene 
using CO2 as a soft oxidant 27. It has been found that CO2 is essential in activation of 1-butene 
over the Fe2O3 catalysts and thus BD production. N2O has also been used as an oxidant in the 
ODH of propane over NiMoO4 catalysts 26, with a small concentration of N2O leading to the 
increase in the selectivity and propylene yields. 
Based on these findings, in this work a commercial Ni-Mo on γ-Al2O3 catalyst was tested for 
ODH of butane in the presence of O2, CO2 and N2O. TPRO (temperature programmed re-
oxidation) experiments were carried out to determine the oxygen properties of the catalyst. 
Effect of oxygen capacity and acidity of the catalyst on the catalytic performance was then 
discussed. The experimental results were supported with theoretical DFT calculations. 
2 Experimental 
The Ni-Mo commercial catalyst with a Ni and Mo wt % of 1.8 and 6.5 on alumina support 
was used for this reaction. The physisorption analyses were carried out by degassing the 
catalysts under N2 flow for 2 h at 200 C. The degassed samples were analysed in a 
Micrometrics ASAP 2020. Temperature programmed reduction (TPR) was performed with 
Micromeritics 2920 Autochem II Chemisorption Analyser. Prior to the reduction of the 
sample in TPR, the catalyst was pre-treated by heating under a stream of argon (30 mL/min) 
at 400 C for 30 min and then cooled to 80 C. Thereafter, 4.9 % hydrogen in argon was used 
as a reducing agent at a flow rate of 30 mL/min. Samples were analysed from room 
temperature to 700 C using a ramp rate of 10 C/min.  In order to determine the oxygen 
capacity and oxygen mobility of the catalysts, temperature programmed re-oxidation (TPRO) 
experiments were carried out. For a TPRO experiment, each catalyst was reduced by n-butane 
(5 % n-butane in He) with a flow rate of 30 mL/min at 500 C for 2 h in the absence of 
oxygen feed in order to consume the lattice oxygen from the catalyst. After that the 
temperature was lowered to 60 C and an appropriate oxidant (10 % O2 in He, 10 % N2O in 
He, or 10 % CO2 in He) with a flow rate of 30 mL/min was passed through the catalyst, while

the temperature was raised to 700 C at a heating rate of 10 C/min. The amount of oxidant 
consumed was measured using a thermal conductivity detector.  
Metal dispersion on the surface of the catalyst was measured with oxygen pulse 
chemisorption by Micromeritics AutoChemII 2920. Samples (200 mg), placed in a U-shaped 
quartz reactor with an inner diameter of 0.5 cm, were pre-treated under 5 % H2 in Ar at the 
temperature 350 C for 2 h. Then, the catalyst was cooled down to 80 C in He flow of 
50 mL/min and kept at this temperature for 3 h before being heated to the desired temperature 
for chemisorption. This was done in order to clean the catalyst surface and to remove any 
residual adsorbed hydrogen. Oxygen pulse chemisorption was performed at the temperature 
of 350 C. Volume of the injection loop was 0.5 cm3, the carrier gas was Ar and pulses of O2 
(5.0 % O2 in Ar), injected in the catalytic reactor, corresponded to 0.5 mol of O2  The O2 
consumption was measured with the same TCD that was used for TPR, but equipped with a 
water trap. Pulses injection, sample temperature and TCD signals were controlled and 
monitored by a computer equipped with the Micromeritics AutoChemII software. TCD data 
were analysed in Origin program suite. 
Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) studies were conducted using a PAN analytical XPert Pro 
instrument. Scans from 10 to 90 were carried out using a Cu/Kα radiation source with a 
wavelength of 1.5406 Å. Particle size, morphology and elemental mapping, performed by 
EDXS analysis, were further investigated using Cs-corrected scanning transmission electron 
microscope (TEM) (JEOL, JEM-ARM200CF), equipped with JEOL Centurio 100 mm2 
EDXS system.  
The oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of n-butane was were carried out in a vertical fixed-
bed U-shaped quartz reactor (100 cm length and 1.5 cm ID). Electric furnace fitted with a 
temperature-programmed controller heated the reactor and reactor temperature was monitored 
with a K-type thermocouple. The gas flow rates were measured and controlled by Brooks 
mass flow controllers. Prior to reaction, each catalyst was pre-treated in situ with He flow 
(50 mL/min) at 400 C for 1 h. The reaction was carried out at different temperatures from 
250 to 550 C, with steps of 50 C. The oxidant-to-butane molar ratio (O2, CO2, or N2O) was 
varied from 1 to 2.75. The experiments were conducted at varying W/F ratio (0.1 to 0.7) at a 
fixed oxidant-to-butane ratio of 2.0 and temperature 450 C. Outlet gases, including butenes, 
butadiene (BD), cracked products (mainly propane and ethane), CO, CO2, H2 and H2O were 
analysed with online quadrupole mass spectrometry (MS). All catalytic tests were carried out

in duplicates and the values obtained for CO conversion showed a standard deviation below

diffusion, Weisz-Prater criterion and Mears Criterion for combined interphase and 
intraparticle heat and mass transport is given in Electronic Supplementary Information. 
The values obtained through these calculations indicate that no interphase and intraparticle 
heat transfer or mass transport limitations involved in the present study 31, 32.  
3 Theoretical 
Plane-wave density functional calculations (DFT) were carried out in Quantum Espresso 
program 33, using open-source PWscf code to calculate the electronic structure and energies. 
Electron-ion-core interactions were described with projector augmented wave (PAW) method 
34 with generalized gradient approximation (GGA) exchange potential of Perdew, Burke and 
Ernzerhof (PBE) 35. Kinetic energy cutoff of 550 eV and electron density cut-off eight times 
as large were found to be sufficient to obtain accurate results, as proved with convergence 
testing. Cutoffs that large were needed as oxygen atoms require very large basis sets to 
converge. Dispersion effects were included semi-empirically via DFT-D2 method of Grimme 
36, 37. Since PBE is known to overbind the oxygen molecule, the energy of isolated O2 
molecule was corrected by E(O2) = 1.59 eV to have the experimentally determined bond 
energy of 5.15 eV, which is standard procedure.

4 Results and discussion  
The Ni and Mo wt % are 1.7 and 6.3, respectively, obtained from the elemental analysis. This 
is in agreement with the nominal wt % of Ni and Mo on alumina support. No presence of 
phosphate, which is sometimes used as a promoter, was detected. Surface area of the catalyst 
was 154 m2/g as measured by N2 physisorption method. This is lower than the surface area of 
γ-Al2O3 (225 m2/g), which could be due to the blockage of pores of alumina with Ni and Mo. 
This is corroborated by total metal dispersion, which was measured as 38  2 % in the oxygen 
pulse chemisorption experiment.  The surface concentration of Ni and Mo was 0.4 mmol NiO 
g-1 and 1.042 mmol MoO3 g-1 and the number of Ni and Mo atoms are 2.5 x 1020 and 6.3 x 
1020. This catalyst is active and selective in the ODH of n-butane with oxygen. The main 
reaction products identified in the reaction mixture were butenes, butadiene, cracked products 
(ethane and propane) and carbon oxides. There were no other products, such as acetaldehyde, 
maleic anhydride, other oxygenates or products of significant catalyst coking when using O2 
oxidant. The homogenous conversion of n-butane without the catalyst is about 0.1 % at 450 
C, which is markedly lower that the conversions obtained with the catalyst.  
4.1 Oxidant-to-butane ratio 
The product distribution is given as a function of the oxygen-to-butane ratio at temperatures 
of 350 C and 450 C. The highest selectivity towards BD was achieved at a molar ratio of 2.0 
at both temperatures (Figure 1). Selectivity towards BD was low, while the amount of CO2 
formed increases with the temperature, which may be due to the increase of coke deposition at 
lower oxygen-to-butane molar ratios 2. At lower oxygen-to-butane molar ratio, more oxygen 
is used to burn the coke deposited on the catalyst surface, leaving no oxygen available for the 
ODH. Increased conversion at higher oxygen-to-butane molar ratio can be attributed to the 
participation of oxygen in the oxidation of n-butane and the intermediates, increasing the 
amount of carbon oxides formed and decreasing the selectivity towards BD 8. The amount of 
butenes formed decreases much more slowly with increased oxygen-to-butane molar ratio.

At higher temperature i.e. 450 C, an oxygen-to-butane molar ratio of 2.0 led to the highest

amount of carbon oxides formed is lower at higher oxygen-to-butane ration, suggesting that 
ODH of butane is favoured at higher temperatures, which is also supported by higher 
conversion. Formation of cracked products is not favourable, being especially low for 
oxygen-to-butane molar ratios 1.5 to 2.2. They form more readily at 450 C than at 350 C,

which is probably due to the thermal cracking of intermediates formed in the ODH of n-
butane (Figure 1). Higher selectivity towards cracked products at low oxygen-to-butane molar 
ratio can be attributed to the oxidative cracking of butane or butene isomers (Figure 1). At 
both temperatures, the catalyst showed a steady state for more than 72 h at oxygen-to-butane 
molar ratio of 2.0.

After evaluating the catalytic activity of the catalyst in the presence of oxygen, the ODH of 
butane with CO2 as the oxidant was performed at temperatures of 350 C and 450 C. At both 
temperatures, the catalyst showed higher selectivity towards BD compared to oxygen 
(Figure 2). Very low conversion (< 10 %) of n-butane was obtained, showing that n-butane is 
not directly oxidised in the presence of CO2 but may undergo the oxidative cracking 
mechanism. This argument also supported by a high selectivity towards cracked products at a 
low CO2-to-butane molar ratio (Figure 2). A low amount of butane and butadiene was 
detected at low CO2-to-butane molar ratios despite the fact that C-H bond dissociation can 
occur on molybdenum metal 38. In the presence of CO2, significant amount of hydrogen and 
CO are formed. Instead of dehydrogenation reaction, CO2 reforming reaction can also take 
place. Hence the results obtained from ODH of n-butane with CO2 indicate that by using CO2 
a new route of reaction is available, namely the formation of hydrogen and CO 39. Of course, 
CO2 can be converted to CO via reverse water-gas shift reaction by consuming the H2 formed 
through dehydrogenation 40. As the CO2-to-butane molar ratio increases, the catalytic activity 
increases, as well as the amount of CO and H2 formed. The butane reactivity studies with CO2 
reveal that the activity of the catalyst also depends on the nature of the oxidant and the 
amount of oxidant present in the feed composition (Figure 2).

Effect of oxidative environment on the ODH of butane at various N2O-to-butane molar ratios 
is shown in Figure 3. With N2O, the main products are butenes and butadiene, while the 
formation of carbon oxides is low. The conversion is low compared to using O2 and increased 
from 2 to 9 % as N2O-to-butane molar ratio increased from 1 to 2.8. This is accompanied by 
increasing the selectivity towards butadiene (Figure 3). No molecular oxygen was detected in 
the effluent gas in these experiments, which evidences the high reactivity of oxygen species. 
At both temperatures, the conversion of butane increases dramatically with increasing N2O-
to-butane ratio up to 2.0. As this ratio is further increases, conversion and selectivity towards 
BD only marginally increase.  
4.2 Flow-rate 
Flow rate of feed gas is an important parameter in catalytic reaction that warrants additional 
attention. The Ni-Mo/Al2O3 catalyst was tested under different weight-to-flow velocities at 
450 C. With increase in W/F, the butane conversion exhibits an increase and the selectivity 
towards BD also increases in all oxidative atmospheres. Similar BD selectivity observed 
suggests that the surface ODH is a relatively slow reaction, favoured from high to low W/F. 
On the contrary, selectivity to both trans-2-butene and cis-2-butene monotonically increases 
as W/F increases, clearly proving that isomerisation of 2-butenes is a fast reaction 41. 
However, the isomerisation to iso-butene seems to be a relatively slow reaction, since a low 
flowrate favours its formation. As expected, formation of coke is concomitantly supressed as 
W/F increases 42. The coke content on the used catalysts seems to correlate well with the BD 
selectivity, suggesting that BD may be a coke precursor, thereby promoting coke formation 
(Table 1). Among the oxidants used, the catalyst used with N2O oxidant showed a high 
amount of coke formation (18 %) on the surface of the catalyst which was measured by TOC 
analysis.

4.3 Oxygen species 
The comparison of runs of butane oxidative dehydrogenation by different oxidizing agents, 
i.e. O2, N2O and CO2 at 450 C, are summarized in Table 1. It can be clearly seen that the 
substitution of O2 with N2O and leads to substantial increase in selectivity to butadiene from 
25 % to 61 %. The higher selectivity to butadiene in the presence of N2O was also observed 
over Ni-Mo/Al2O3 catalyst. On the other hand, fewer carbon oxides were observed. The 
differences between runs with different oxidizing agents are caused by the different natures of 
oxygen species formed on the catalyst surface. The active species in oxidative 
dehydrogenation with oxygen is the O2 - ion, which is less selective and supports the total and 
incomplete combustion of hydrocarbons, in contrast to the oxygen species formed upon 
decomposition of nitrous oxide1, 43, 44. Most authors consider O- radical or neutral atomic 
oxygen to be the active oxidizing species in the presence of N2O. These oxygen species 
govern the activity and selectivity in dehydrogenation step. 
When using O2 as oxidant, there is a negligible amount of H2 formed as any would be 
instantly consumed by the oxygen. When using N2O and CO2 as oxidants, some hydrogen is 
formed as the two are weaker oxidants. Hydrogen can form via water-gas shift reaction from 
H2O, which is formed during butane oxidation, and a side product CO.

In literature 1, 13, 39, 45, it was reported that the reaction of C1- C4 alkanes with O- gives 
significant amounts of olefins, but no oxygenated products over transition metal oxides. The 
remarkable selectivity of N2O relates to a particular state of anion radical oxygen species Oα
- 
which is named as α-oxygen 1, 46. N2O forms α-sites on the surface of the catalysts, but cannot 
form an O2 site. It is assumed that oxygen, upon adsorption on the catalyst surface can accept 
electrons one by one until transforming into a fully reduced form 47. Oxygen species may 
differ not only in charge but also in coordination, bond energy etc. In general, molybdate 
catalysts contains terminal oxygen species, leading to a conclusion that the doubly bonded 
lattice oxygen is responsible for selective oxidation 1, 46, 48. Selective oxidation is provided by 
strongly bonded lattice oxygen having nucleophilic nature, and complete oxidation is 
provided by weakly bonded reactive oxygen having electrophilic nature 26, 48. Under the 
conditions employed in the present study, we couldnt distinct between different oxidation 
species available on the catalyst surface. Therefore, one cannot exclude that lattice oxygen 
may react via its preliminary conversion into come more reactive form i.e. O- radical species 1, 
26, 48.  
The reaction with oxygen as oxidant showed higher butane TOF compared to the reactions 
with CO2 and N2O as oxidants (Table 2). Obtained TOF over Ni-Mo/Al2O3 catalyst in the 
present study is higher compared to other catalytic systems (Electronic Supplementary 
Information, Table S1). Thus, the anion radical oxygen species (α-oxygen) are the selective 
oxygen species for the production of butadienes from butane as observed by the productivity 
with the reaction which used N2O as oxidant.

4.4 Mars-van-Krevelen mechanism 
The oxidative dehydrogenation of n-butane to butene and 1,3-butadiene follows the Marsvan 
Krevelen mechanism, as also reported by several researchers 2, 7, 8, 38. In this mechanism, 
chemisorption of n-butane, activation of CH bond, and abstraction of hydrogen from n-
butane to form alkyl radical-metal cation intermediate are important steps in the oxidative 
dehydrogenation of n-butane 27, 49, 50. The rates of ODH are enhanced if the cation present in 
the catalyst is a weak acid and can be reduced with two electrons transferred from C-H bonds. 
Additionally, a high concentration of surface oxygen can also enhance the rate of ODH 7, 8, 13. 
This suggests that oxygen properties and acid properties of the catalyst play a very important 
role in the oxidative dehydrogenation of n-butane. Considering the mechanism of n-butane 
activation reported by various researchers 2, 9, 13, 39, 51, 52, it can be inferred that the amount of 
oxygen in the catalyst involved in the reaction (oxygen capacity) may serve as a crucial factor 
determining the catalytic performance, while the intrinsic mobility of oxygen in the catalyst 
involved in the reaction (oxygen mobility) may affect the working regeneration cycles of the 
catalyst during this reaction. However, to the best of our knowledge, a systematic research to 
see the influence of oxygen capacity and mobility of the catalyst in the oxidative 
dehydrogenation of n-butane has not been endeavoured yet.

An oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes is considered to proceed by a redox mechanism in 
which the reducibility of active sites is a key factor the catalyst activity 53. In order to measure 
the reducibility of Ni and Mo species and metal oxide support interaction, TPR analyses were

catalyst exhibited similar reduction behaviour with the Tmax of hydrogen consumption 
between 400460 C. The catalyst reduced at lower temperature under butane, which is 
probably due to the strong reducing nature of butane compared to hydrogen 13, 52, 54. The TPR 
profiles indicate that the surface species on alumina widely modified the reduction behaviour 
of molybdenum and nickel oxides. Usually, the reduction of supported MoO3 species occurs 
in several steps 13, while the reduction of NiO occurs above 500 C 55. The single peak at low 
temperature (< 500 C) can be due to the partial reduction of molybdenum along with NiO 53, 
55, 56. The aggregated MoO3 may also promote Ni intermediate reducible species of Ni and 
Mo, which may also occur in a single step reduction. It was also reported 56, 57 that the Ni-Mo 
active phase over various supports is reduced at lower temperature (<500 C) and exhibited a 
single reduction peak (<500 C), which is in agreement with the observations in our work.  
The reducibility of the catalyst is 89 % and 51 % under n-butane and hydrogen respectively. 
The XPS spectra of the fresh catalyst shows only Mo6+ species with Mo 3d5/2 and Mo 3d3/2 
binding energies at 233.1 and 236.2 eV, respectively. After reduction with n-butane, the 
catalyst shows the Mo species with 3d5/2 binding energies for Mo5+ and Mo4+ species at 231.2 
and 229.0 eV, respectively (Electronic Supplementary Information, Figures S1). In 
addition to this, the XPS profile of the fresh catalyst showed the Ni peaks which can be 
identified with Ni2+ in NiO species, with Ni 2p3/2 binding energies appearing at 854 eV. After 
reduction, this peak shifted to 853 eV, which represented the formation of Ni0 after reduction. 
However, the interactions of support depend on different parameters, such as isoelectric point 
of the support and the number of hydroxyl groups present on the surface of the support. 
According to Banares 58, there is some disagreement arising from the fact that some reports 
show correlation between catalytic activity and bulk reducibility of the molybdate catalyst, 
which may differ significantly from that of the surface sites and lead to different conclusions. 
TPR studies performed in this work showed no a correlation between bulk reducibility and 
activity of the catalyst. In this study, TPR profiles reflect the structural transformation of the 
starting high valence oxides into structurally distinct suboxides. Numerous investigations 59-61 
claim that what could have a major effect on the activity in oxidative dehydrogenation is the 
re-oxidation and not the reduction of the catalyst during reaction conditions. 
It has been reported in literature 7, 38, 48, 49 that oxygen capacity and oxygen mobility of 
catalyst serve as crucial factors determining the catalytic performance in oxidative 
dehydrogenation of n-butane. In order to investigate the effect of various oxidants on the 
oxygen property of catalysts, TPRO experiments were carried out, where we tried to correlate

the catalytic performance under different oxygen sources with the oxygen capacity of 
catalysts. In the TPRO experiment, the TPRO peak temperature and TPRO peak area reflect 
the oxygen mobility and the oxygen capacity, respectively 50, 60, 61.  The lower TPRO peak 
temperature (< 350 C) and the larger TPRO peak area correspond to the higher oxygen 
mobility and the larger oxygen capacity, respectively.  Figure 5b shows the TPRO profile of 
the catalyst under various oxygen sources. The three peaks in the range of 150 to 450 C 
under oxygen atmosphere specify that under oxygen environment the reduced catalyst 
undergoes a step-wise re-oxidation (Mo4+  Mo6+). The first peak can be ascribed to the 
surface oxygen sites of the catalyst, while the other two peaks can be attributed to fraction of 
lattice oxygens on the surface of the catalyst 62. Under CO2 atmosphere, there is a broad peak 
observed in the temperature range of 80-450 C, which indicates much adsorption and high 
activation ability of CO2 on the surface of the catalyst 39, 63. In general, the peak shift towards 
lower temperatures indicates a superior accessibility of the lattice oxygen. The peak shift 
towards lower temperatures was observed in the TPRO profile under N2O atmosphere along 
with a shoulder peak in the range of 250-350 C, suggesting that N2O has a stronger 
adsorption capability on the surface of the catalyst and it facilitates an easier migration of 
lattice oxygen from bulk to surface to complete the oxidation process 43, 62.  The degree of 
reduction is 84 % in the case of O2, 51 % in the case of CO2 and 61 % in the case of N2O. The 
XPS spectra of the re-oxidised catalyst ( with O2) showed Mo6+ species with Mo 3d5/2 and Mo 
3d3/2 binding energies at 233.8 and 236.7 eV, respectively (Electronic Supplementary 
Information, Figures S1). The spectra were deconvoluted using the constraints of having 
equal spin-orbit splitting of Mo 3d peaks, and it showed most of the Mo species in the +6 
oxidation state (68%). 
Among the oxidants used in this study, N2O showed an important difference in the catalytic 
performance. The observation made from both catalytic testing and TPRO experiments is that 
when N2O interacts with nickel molybdate catalysts, modifying the nature of the sites on the 
surface of the catalysts. When O2 is an oxidant, the amount of re-oxidised sites is higher than 
those observed in the presence of N2O. In other words, the surface of the catalysts is in a 
higher oxidation state in the presence of O2. Multiple peaks in the broad temperature range 
observed in TPRO profile are in agreement with this. To the contrary, the oxidation of surface 
is limited in the presence of N2O. These results suggest that under reaction conditions, N2O 
inhibits the total oxidation of the catalyst.

To investigate the rates of reduction and oxidation a series of experiments with various 
heating rates were conducted (Electronic Supplementary Information, 4).  The rate of 
reduction (in the presence of 5 % H2) was obtained as 2.4 x 10-7 mol g-1 s-1 which is similar to 
the rate of oxidation (in the presence of 5 % O2) was obtained as 2.1 x 10-7 mol g-1 s-1.  The 
lower rate of oxidation could be due to the oxygen mobility in the Ni-Mo/Al2O3 catalyst. The 
activation energies were obtained as 110.3 kJ/mol for reduction and 132.2 kJ/mol for 
oxidation (Electronic Supplementary Information, Figures S2-S4). The similarity in the 
oxidation and reduction rates along with TPRO profiles indicates that the oxidative 
dehydrogenation of n-butane to butene and 1,3-butadiene over the Ni-Mo/Al2O3 catalyst 
follows the Marsvan Krevelen mechanism.  
To investigate the phases present after re-oxidation under various atmospheres, powder XRD 
was done. In the XRD profile of the present catalyst, two prominent diffraction peaks shown 
in the 2θ range at 46 and 67, which can be assigned to γ-Al2O3. An amorphous peak at 37 
indicates the presence of NiO. On the other hand, lack of characteristic diffraction peaks for 
NiO at 43 and 67 indicates the presence of amorphous phase or monocrystalline NiO phases 
(PDF card no. 47-1049). Similar pattern was observed for the diffraction peaks of MoO3. The 
amorphous peak at 26 indicates the presence of MoO3 (PDF card no. 65-2421). The other 
characteristic peaks at 39, 46 and 66  were not observed clearly, which might be due to the 
presence of amorphous or monocrystalline phase of molybdenum oxide. 
After re-oxidation with O2, the catalyst showed the similar XRD pattern, which is supported 
by the TPRO profile that the surface oxygen species and the lattice oxygen species are 
completely redistributed into catalyst after TPRO experiment. After TPRO with N2O and 
CO2, catalyst showed an XRD pattern, different from that observed with O2, with some 
additional peaks. The peaks at 23, 32, 38 and 62 indicate the formation of NiMoO4 phase 
(PDF, card no.9-175) on the surface of alumina after TPRO experiment. The enhancement of 
peak intensity at 37, 46 and 67 suggested the conversion of NiO and MoO3 to NiMoO4 
phase. The formation of peak at 23 with a shoulder indicates the overlap of MoO3 and 
NiMoO4 phase. The enhancement in the characteristic peak intensity of NiO and MoO3 
suggests the formation of crystalline oxide phases of Ni and Mo after the oxidation with N2O 
and CO2. This could be due to the partial oxidation of metal oxides due to the low oxidation 
environment. In addition to NiMoO4 phase, the increase in the peak intensity at 46 and 67 
might be due to the formation of stoichiometric NiAl2O4 spinel phase, as well.

4.6 Activation energy 
The activation energies (EA) for oxidative dehydrogenation of butane were determined 
through Arrhenius equation in the temperature range from 250 C to 550 C. The activation 
energy depend on the oxidant used, as shown in Table 2. When using O2 as oxidant, EA is 
75 kJ mol-1. In CO2 and N2O atmosphere, however, EA is 161 and 112 kJ mol-1. Together with 
noticeably different conversion and selectivity, this further proves that reaction proceeds via 
fundamentally different mechanism and rate-determining step in O2 atmosphere. 
In O2 atmosphere, we postulate the rate-determining step to be the re-oxidation of active site 
on the catalyst, namely the formation of O-Mo and O-Ni species. In milder conditions, e.g. 
when using N2O and CO2, the surface oxygen is less reactive and the rate-determining step is 
abstraction of the first hydrogen atom from butane. This was further investigated and 
corroborated (vide infra) with DFT theoretical studies. 
4.7 Density functional theory calculations 
In DFT calculations, active catalyst phase was modelled as {110} facet of α-NiMoO4 64. In 
bulk, Ni and Mo atoms are octahedrally coordinated with oxygen atoms. The {110} facet can

be additionally oxygen-terminated on Mo atoms, Ni atoms, or both. We found that Mo atoms 
were oxygen-terminated regardless of the oxidant used, while Ni atoms are oxygen-
terminated only in the presence of O2, but with CO2 and N2O (see Figure 7).

energetically favoured, as the CO produced is adsorbed atop Ni atoms in the first irreversible 
exothermic step, only to be subsequently desorbed.

This difference in surface composition has profound effects on the conversion and selectivity, 
as fully oxygen-terminated facet favours oxidative decomposition of butane into cracked 
products and COx, while surfaces with only oxygen-terminated Mo atoms favour selective 
oxidation of butane into butenes and 1,3-butadiene, as shown below.

hydrogen is +1.49 eV (144 kJ mol-1), while the abstraction of methylenic hydrogen is 
somewhat less likely with the barrier of +1.71 eV (165 kJ mol-1). These are the rate-
determining steps with values in good agreement with experimental data from Section 4.6. 
Further dehydrogenation steps lead first to the formation of 1-butene and 2-butene, which 
have similar activation energies for desorption and further dehydrogenation, thus all products 
are expected and were identified among the products. Ultimately, butadiene is formed. As 
shown in Figure 9, the most likely pathway for selective oxidation to butadiene is therefore

Abstraction of hydrogen atom from the reactant results in the formation of OH groups on the 
catalyst, which is typical of Mars van Krevelen mechanism of catalysis (Figure 10). Hydrogen 
atoms are extremely mobile on the surface; activation barrier for migration of hydrogen 
between two adjacent OH groups was found to be 0.02 eV (2 kJ mol-1). This results in the 
recovery of one oxygen site and the formation of adsorbed water molecule with adsorption 
energy of 1.10 eV (106 kJ mol-1), which then desorbs. Oxygen vacancies are replenished

with oxygen from the oxidant. Activation barriers for the reaction with N2O is 0.74 eV 
(71 kJ mol-1) and for CO2 is 0.73 eV (70 kJ mol-1), which is clearly not a rate-determining 
step. 
When molecular oxygen is used as oxidant, however, the barrier for vacancies replenishment 
drops to 0.64 eV (62 kJ mol-1) and leads to non-negligible formation of both, O-Mo and O-Ni 
surface species. Pathway for selective oxidation would remain as in Figure 10, but new 
pathway for total oxidation becomes possible. Such fully oxygen-terminated surface shows 
much greater reactivity towards butane decomposition. Butane weakly physisorbs (Eads = 
0.27 eV). It immediately reacts with surface O-Ni species into strongly bound butan-1-ol 
(EA = 0.05 eV, E = 3.57 eV) in a very exothermic reaction. Butan-1-ol is then quickly 
decomposed into cracked products and COx. Hydroxyl hydrogen quickly migrates across the 
surface 
O-Ni 
groups 
(EA = 0.10 eV), 
yielding 
butyloxidanyl 
(CH3CH2CH2CH2O·). 
Subsequently, both hydrogen atoms are abstracted, yielding butanal (CH3CH2CH2CHO) and 
butyloxidanyl (CH3CH2CH2CO·) in the process with activation barriers of 0.25 eV (24 kJ mol-
1) and 0.49 eV (48 kJ mol-1), respectively. Butyloxidanyl is prone to C-C bond cleavage, 
ultimately yielding cracked products and COx. These results support experimental data.  
Different surface species when using O2 (O-Ni and O-Mo) as oxidant in comparison to using 
N2O and CO2 (only O-Mo) are responsible for markedly different conversion and selectivity. 
Our calculations show the abstraction of first hydrogen atom to be the rate-determining step in 
selective oxidation of butane with activation energy of 144 kJ mol-1. This is in good 
agreement with experimental values of 161 kJ mol-1 and 112 kJ mol-1 when using N2O and 
CO2, respectively. CO2 is deemed a weaker oxidant on the account of having higher activation 
energy, lower productivity, and lower butadiene/butenes ratio. Despite the same reaction 
mechanism postulated in DFT modelling, we aim to explain these differences by different 
affinity of the surface for replenishing oxygen with CO2 (E = 0.19 eV) and N2O (E = 
3.14 eV). In case of N2O, all Mo atoms are believed to be oxygen-terminated, which might 
not be the case with CO2. Additionally, CO2 is converted into CO in the process, which can 
stay adsorbed on the catalyst, diminishing its active surface further. 
Fully oxygen-terminated surface favours total oxidation of butane to cracked products and 
COx, as butane immediately and irreversibly transforms into butan-1-ol. The rate-determining 
step is replenishing surface vacancies with oxygen, which has a calculated reaction barrier of

75 kJ mol-1. 
Conclusions 
From our experimental and theoretical results, we conclude the following: 
1. CO2 and N2O are useful reagents for oxidative dehydrogenation of n-butane over Ni-
Mo/Al2O3 catalyst, exhibiting advantageous selectivity over using oxygen. 
2. The most abundant product of selective oxidation was butadiene with productivity up 
to 0.89 gbutadiene. gcat
-1 h-1 when using N2O as an oxidant, 0.61 gbutadiene. gcat
-1 h-1 when 
using CO2 as an oxidant and 0.21 gbutadiene. gcat
-1 h-1when using O2 as an oxidant. 
Cumulative selectivity of all C4 olefins was up to 80 % when CO2 and N2O were used 
as oxidants. 
3. Using soft oxidants like N2O and CO2 limits the formation of electrophilic oxygen 
species, which promote the oxidation of alkenes to carbon oxides, on the surface of the 
catalyst, thereby increasing the selectivity towards butadiene. The coke content on the 
used catalysts correlates well with the selectivity towards butadiene, suggesting that 
butadiene may be a coke precursor. 
4. TPRO profiles showed N2O had a stronger adsorption capability on the surface of the 
catalyst compared to CO2 and O2 and that it facilitates easier migration of lattice 
oxygen from bulk to surface to complete the oxidation process. After TPRO 
experiment with CO2 and N2O, a partial oxidation of the catalyst was observed in 
XRD.  
5. The experimentally determined activation energy (EA) with CO2 and N2O as oxidants, 
161 and 112 kJ mol-1, respectively, is in good agreement with theoretically predicted 
activation energy 144 kJ mol-1 for the abstraction of first hydrogen atom from butane, 
suggesting that this is the rate-determining step. 
6. In oxygen atmosphere, the experimentally determined activation energy 75 kJ mol-1. 
This is in close agreement with theoretically calculated value of 62 kJ mol-1 for re-
oxidation of the surface. Calculated activation barriers for other steps are lower, 
confirming that the re-oxidation of surface is the rate-determining step. 
7. Calculated reaction barriers from DFT are in excellent agreement with experimental 
data, proving the postulated reaction mechanism to be sound. Selective oxidation of 
butane to butenes and, ultimately, butadiene proceeds with the transfer of hydrogens to

O-Mo species on the catalyst. Total oxidation proceeds on fully oxygen-terminated 
surface via O-Ni species and yields cracked products and COx. As typical for Mars 
van Krevelen mechanism, surface oxygen species (O-Mo and O-Ni) are recovered via 
recombination with two hydrogen atoms to water molecule, its desorption and the 
replenishment of the ensuing vacancy with oxygen from gaseous oxidant (O2, N2O, or 
CO2).

Compare and contrast the mechanisms of C-H bond activation and catalyst regeneration in oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes for redox-active and redox-inactive metal oxide catalysts, explaining the role of traditional oxidants and CO2. Include a discussion on the effectiveness of different catalysts (such as V2O5, VOx/SiO2, CeO2, and transition metal clusters) in activating CO2 for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane, considering the proposed mechanisms and energy barriers for CO2 dissociation.
