The mechanisms of C-H bond activation and catalyst regeneration in oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of alkanes differ between redox-active and redox-inactive metal oxide catalysts. 

For redox-active catalysts like vanadium oxides, the Mars-van Krevelen mechanism is typically followed. This involves the abstraction of hydrogen from the alkane by lattice oxygen, followed by catalyst reoxidation by gas-phase oxidants. The catalyst's lattice oxygen mobility and storage capacity play crucial roles in this process.

Redox-inactive catalysts like CeO2 operate through a different mechanism, often involving the formation of active oxygen species on the catalyst surface, which then abstract hydrogen from the alkane.

Traditional oxidants like O2 are highly effective but can lead to over-oxidation and lower selectivity. CO2 and N2O, considered "soft oxidants," offer improved selectivity by limiting the formation of electrophilic oxygen species that promote total oxidation.

For CO2 activation in ODH, catalysts like V2O5, VOx/SiO2, and transition metal clusters have shown promise. The effectiveness of these catalysts depends on their ability to dissociate CO2 and create active oxygen species. The proposed mechanisms often involve CO2 adsorption, dissociation to CO and surface oxygen, and subsequent reaction with the alkane.

Energy barriers for CO2 dissociation vary depending on the catalyst. Transition metal clusters and certain oxide surfaces can lower these barriers, making CO2 activation more feasible. However, the energy barriers for CO2 dissociation are generally higher than those for traditional oxidants, which can limit conversion rates.

CO2 as an oxidant in ODH reactions offers several advantages, including improved selectivity and the potential for CO2 utilization. However, its effectiveness is often lower than traditional oxidants due to the challenges in CO2 activation. The choice between traditional oxidants and CO2 depends on the specific catalyst system and the desired balance between conversion and selectivity.

烷烃氧化脱氢(ODH)反应中C-H键活化和催化剂再生的机理在氧化还原活性和非氧化还原活性金属氧化物催化剂之间存在差异。

对于钒氧化物等氧化还原活性催化剂,通常遵循Mars-van Krevelen机理。这涉及晶格氧从烷烃中夺取氢,然后催化剂被气相氧化剂重新氧化。催化剂的晶格氧移动性和储存能力在这个过程中起着关键作用。

像CeO2这样的非氧化还原活性催化剂通过不同的机理运作,通常涉及在催化剂表面形成活性氧物种,然后从烷烃中夺取氢。

O2等传统氧化剂效果很好,但可能导致过度氧化和选择性降低。CO2和N2O被认为是"软氧化剂",通过限制促进完全氧化的亲电氧物种的形成,提高了选择性。

对于CO2在ODH中的活化,V2O5、VOx/SiO2和过渡金属簇等催化剂显示出了前景。这些催化剂的有效性取决于它们解离CO2和创造活性氧物种的能力。提出的机理通常涉及CO2吸附、解离为CO和表面氧,然后与烷烃反应。

CO2解离的能垒因催化剂而异。过渡金属簇和某些氧化物表面可以降低这些能垒,使CO2活化更容易实现。然而,CO2解离的能垒通常高于传统氧化剂,这可能限制转化率。

CO2作为ODH反应的氧化剂具有几个优势,包括提高选择性和CO2利用的潜力。然而,由于CO2活化的挑战,其有效性通常低于传统氧化剂。在传统氧化剂和CO2之间的选择取决于特定的催化剂系统以及所需的转化率和选择性之间的平衡。
