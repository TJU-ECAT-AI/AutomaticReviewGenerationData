[1] "Oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of n-butane usually gives a lower yield of coke and cracking products because the reaction is exothermic"

[2] "CO2 and N2O have been reported as soft oxidants for ODH of light alkanes"

[3] "The use of these soft oxidants has several benefits over molecular oxygen, such as minimising the total oxidation reaction, further improving the selectivity towards partially oxidized products, increasing the process safety by reducing the explosion risk and using up N2O and CO2, which are major greenhouse gases in the atmosphere"

[4] "The oxidative dehydrogenation of n-butane to butene and 1,3-butadiene follows the Marsvan Krevelen mechanism"

[5] "Using soft oxidants like N2O and CO2 limits the formation of electrophilic oxygen species, which promote the oxidation of alkenes to carbon oxides, on the surface of the catalyst, thereby increasing the selectivity towards butadiene."

[6] "Selective oxidation of butane to butenes and, ultimately, butadiene proceeds with the transfer of hydrogens to O-Mo species on the catalyst. Total oxidation proceeds on fully oxygen-terminated surface via O-Ni species and yields cracked products and COx."

[7] "As typical for Mars van Krevelen mechanism, surface oxygen species (O-Mo and O-Ni) are recovered via recombination with two hydrogen atoms to water molecule, its desorption and the replenishment of the ensuing vacancy with oxygen from gaseous oxidant (O2, N2O, or CO2)."

The mechanisms of C-H bond activation and catalyst regeneration in oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of alkanes differ between redox-active and redox-inactive metal oxide catalysts. 

For redox-active catalysts like NiMo/Al2O3, the Mars-van Krevelen mechanism is followed. C-H bond activation occurs through hydrogen abstraction by surface oxygen species, particularly O-Mo species. The catalyst is then regenerated by replenishing oxygen vacancies with gaseous oxidants.

Traditional oxidants like O2 are highly reactive but can lead to over-oxidation and lower selectivity. CO2 and N2O act as "soft oxidants", providing several advantages:

1. They minimize total oxidation reactions
2. Improve selectivity towards partially oxidized products
3. Increase process safety by reducing explosion risk
4. Utilize greenhouse gases

The effectiveness of different catalysts in activating CO2 for ODH of propane varies:

1. V2O5 and VOx/SiO2 are effective due to their redox properties
2. CeO2 can activate CO2 through oxygen vacancies
3. Transition metal clusters may offer unique CO2 activation pathways

The proposed mechanisms generally involve CO2 adsorption, dissociation, and oxygen incorporation into the catalyst. Energy barriers for CO2 dissociation depend on the catalyst composition and structure, with some catalysts lowering the activation energy significantly compared to gas-phase dissociation.

Overall, the choice of catalyst and oxidant in ODH reactions greatly influences the reaction pathway, selectivity, and efficiency. Soft oxidants like CO2 offer promising alternatives to traditional oxidants for more selective and environmentally friendly ODH processes.

在烷烃的氧化脱氢(ODH)反应中，氧化还原活性和氧化还原惰性金属氧化物催化剂的C-H键活化和催化剂再生机制存在差异。

对于NiMo/Al2O3等氧化还原活性催化剂，遵循Mars-van Krevelen机制。C-H键活化通过表面氧物种（特别是O-Mo物种）的氢原子抽提发生。然后通过气相氧化剂补充氧空位来再生催化剂。

传统氧化剂如O2反应性很高，但可能导致过度氧化和较低的选择性。CO2和N2O作为"软氧化剂"提供了几个优势：

1. 最大限度地减少总氧化反应
2. 提高对部分氧化产物的选择性
3. 通过降低爆炸风险提高工艺安全性
4. 利用温室气体

不同催化剂在活化CO2用于丙烷ODH方面的效果各不相同：

1. V2O5和VOx/SiO2由于其氧化还原特性而有效
2. CeO2可以通过氧空位活化CO2
3. 过渡金属团簇可能提供独特的CO2活化途径

提出的机制通常涉及CO2吸附、解离和氧掺入催化剂。CO2解离的能量障碍取决于催化剂的组成和结构，某些催化剂与气相解离相比可显著降低活化能。

总的来说，ODH反应中催化剂和氧化剂的选择极大地影响反应途径、选择性和效率。CO2等软氧化剂为更具选择性和环境友好的ODH过程提供了有前景的替代方案。
