[1] "Oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of n-butane usually gives a lower yield of coke and cracking products because the reaction is exothermic"

[2] "CO2 and N2O have been reported as soft oxidants for ODH of light alkanes"

[3] "The use of these soft oxidants has several benefits over molecular oxygen, such as minimising the total oxidation reaction, further improving the selectivity towards partially oxidized products, increasing the process safety by reducing the explosion risk and using up N2O and CO2, which are major greenhouse gases in the atmosphere"

[4] "The oxidative dehydrogenation of n-butane to butene and 1,3-butadiene follows the Marsvan Krevelen mechanism"

[5] "Using soft oxidants like N2O and CO2 limits the formation of electrophilic oxygen species, which promote the oxidation of alkenes to carbon oxides, on the surface of the catalyst, thereby increasing the selectivity towards butadiene."

[6] "Selective oxidation of butane to butenes and, ultimately, butadiene proceeds with the transfer of hydrogens to O-Mo species on the catalyst. Total oxidation proceeds on fully oxygen-terminated surface via O-Ni species and yields cracked products and COx."

[7] "As typical for Mars van Krevelen mechanism, surface oxygen species (O-Mo and O-Ni) are recovered via recombination with two hydrogen atoms to water molecule, its desorption and the replenishment of the ensuing vacancy with oxygen from gaseous oxidant (O2, N2O, or CO2)."

The mechanisms of C-H bond activation and catalyst regeneration in oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of alkanes differ between redox-active and redox-inactive metal oxide catalysts. 

For redox-active catalysts like NiMo/Al2O3, the Mars-van Krevelen mechanism is followed. C-H bond activation occurs through hydrogen abstraction by surface oxygen species, particularly O-Mo species. The catalyst is then regenerated by replenishing oxygen vacancies with gaseous oxidants.

Traditional oxidants like O2 are highly reactive but can lead to over-oxidation and lower selectivity. CO2 and N2O act as "soft oxidants", providing several advantages:

1. They minimize total oxidation reactions
2. Improve selectivity towards partially oxidized products
3. Increase process safety by reducing explosion risk
4. Utilize greenhouse gases

The effectiveness of different catalysts in activating CO2 for ODH of propane varies:

1. V2O5 and VOx/SiO2 are effective due to their redox properties
2. CeO2 can activate CO2 through oxygen vacancies
3. Transition metal clusters may offer unique CO2 activation pathways

The proposed mechanisms generally involve CO2 adsorption, dissociation, and oxygen incorporation into the catalyst. Energy barriers for CO2 dissociation depend on the catalyst composition and structure, with some catalysts lowering the activation energy significantly compared to gas-phase dissociation.

Overall, the choice of catalyst and oxidant in ODH reactions greatly influences the reaction pathway, selectivity, and efficiency. Soft oxidants like CO2 offer promising alternatives to traditional oxidants for more selective and environmentally friendly ODH processes.

在烷烃的氧化脱氢(ODH)反应中，氧化还原活性和氧化还原惰性金属氧化物催化剂的C-H键活化和催化剂再生机制存在差异。

对于NiMo/Al2O3等氧化还原活性催化剂，遵循Mars-van Krevelen机制。C-H键活化通过表面氧物种（特别是O-Mo物种）的氢原子抽提发生。然后通过气相氧化剂补充氧空位来再生催化剂。

传统氧化剂如O2反应性很高，但可能导致过度氧化和较低的选择性。CO2和N2O作为"软氧化剂"提供了几个优势：

1. 最大限度地减少总氧化反应
2. 提高对部分氧化产物的选择性
3. 通过降低爆炸风险提高工艺安全性
4. 利用温室气体

不同催化剂在活化CO2用于丙烷ODH方面的效果各不相同：

1. V2O5和VOx/SiO2由于其氧化还原特性而有效
2. CeO2可以通过氧空位活化CO2
3. 过渡金属团簇可能提供独特的CO2活化途径

提出的机制通常涉及CO2吸附、解离和氧掺入催化剂。CO2解离的能量障碍取决于催化剂的组成和结构，某些催化剂与气相解离相比可显著降低活化能。

总的来说，ODH反应中催化剂和氧化剂的选择极大地影响反应途径、选择性和效率。CO2等软氧化剂为更具选择性和环境友好的ODH过程提供了有前景的替代方案。

The mechanisms of C-H bond activation and catalyst regeneration in oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of alkanes differ between redox-active and redox-inactive metal oxide catalysts. 

For redox-active catalysts like vanadium oxides, the Mars-van Krevelen mechanism is typically followed. This involves the abstraction of hydrogen from the alkane by lattice oxygen, followed by catalyst reoxidation by gas-phase oxidants. The catalyst's lattice oxygen mobility and storage capacity play crucial roles in this process.

Redox-inactive catalysts like CeO2 operate through a different mechanism, often involving the formation of active oxygen species on the catalyst surface, which then abstract hydrogen from the alkane.

Traditional oxidants like O2 are highly effective but can lead to over-oxidation and lower selectivity. CO2 and N2O, considered "soft oxidants," offer improved selectivity by limiting the formation of electrophilic oxygen species that promote total oxidation.

For CO2 activation in ODH, catalysts like V2O5, VOx/SiO2, and transition metal clusters have shown promise. The effectiveness of these catalysts depends on their ability to dissociate CO2 and create active oxygen species. The proposed mechanisms often involve CO2 adsorption, dissociation to CO and surface oxygen, and subsequent reaction with the alkane.

Energy barriers for CO2 dissociation vary depending on the catalyst. Transition metal clusters and certain oxide surfaces can lower these barriers, making CO2 activation more feasible. However, the energy barriers for CO2 dissociation are generally higher than those for traditional oxidants, which can limit conversion rates.

CO2 as an oxidant in ODH reactions offers several advantages, including improved selectivity and the potential for CO2 utilization. However, its effectiveness is often lower than traditional oxidants due to the challenges in CO2 activation. The choice between traditional oxidants and CO2 depends on the specific catalyst system and the desired balance between conversion and selectivity.

烷烃氧化脱氢(ODH)反应中C-H键活化和催化剂再生的机理在氧化还原活性和非氧化还原活性金属氧化物催化剂之间存在差异。

对于钒氧化物等氧化还原活性催化剂,通常遵循Mars-van Krevelen机理。这涉及晶格氧从烷烃中夺取氢,然后催化剂被气相氧化剂重新氧化。催化剂的晶格氧移动性和储存能力在这个过程中起着关键作用。

像CeO2这样的非氧化还原活性催化剂通过不同的机理运作,通常涉及在催化剂表面形成活性氧物种,然后从烷烃中夺取氢。

O2等传统氧化剂效果很好,但可能导致过度氧化和选择性降低。CO2和N2O被认为是"软氧化剂",通过限制促进完全氧化的亲电氧物种的形成,提高了选择性。

对于CO2在ODH中的活化,V2O5、VOx/SiO2和过渡金属簇等催化剂显示出了前景。这些催化剂的有效性取决于它们解离CO2和创造活性氧物种的能力。提出的机理通常涉及CO2吸附、解离为CO和表面氧,然后与烷烃反应。

CO2解离的能垒因催化剂而异。过渡金属簇和某些氧化物表面可以降低这些能垒,使CO2活化更容易实现。然而,CO2解离的能垒通常高于传统氧化剂,这可能限制转化率。

CO2作为ODH反应的氧化剂具有几个优势,包括提高选择性和CO2利用的潜力。然而,由于CO2活化的挑战,其有效性通常低于传统氧化剂。在传统氧化剂和CO2之间的选择取决于特定的催化剂系统以及所需的转化率和选择性之间的平衡。

This involves the transfer of hydrogen atoms from the alkane to surface oxygen species, followed by the regeneration of these oxygen species through the oxidant.

Traditional oxidants like O2 are highly reactive and can lead to over-oxidation, resulting in the formation of carbon oxides. In contrast, soft oxidants like CO2 and N2O offer improved selectivity towards desired products like butadiene. This is because they limit the formation of electrophilic oxygen species on the catalyst surface, which are responsible for undesired total oxidation reactions.

The effectiveness of different catalysts in activating CO2 for ODH of propane varies. While the document doesn't provide specific information on V2O5, VOx/SiO2, CeO2, or transition metal clusters, it does discuss the use of NiMo/Al2O3 catalyst. For this catalyst, CO2 activation involves the replenishment of oxygen vacancies on the catalyst surface. The energy barrier for this process with CO2 is similar to that of N2O, but higher than O2, making CO2 a milder oxidant.

The proposed mechanism for selective oxidation involves the transfer of hydrogens to O-Mo species on the catalyst surface, leading to the formation of butenes and butadiene. In contrast, total oxidation occurs on fully oxygen-terminated surfaces via O-Ni species, resulting in cracked products and COx. The catalyst regeneration step involves the recombination of surface oxygen species with hydrogen atoms to form water, which desorbs, creating a vacancy that is then filled by oxygen from the gaseous oxidant.

While the document doesn't provide specific energy barriers for CO2 dissociation on different catalysts, it does mention that the activation energy for vacancy replenishment with CO2 is similar to that of N2O, suggesting that CO2 can be effectively activated for ODH reactions under appropriate conditions.

传统的氧化剂如O2反应性很高,可能导致过度氧化,形成碳氧化物。相比之下,CO2和N2O等软氧化剂可以提高对目标产物(如丁二烯)的选择性。这是因为它们限制了催化剂表面亲电氧物种的形成,这些物种会导致不需要的完全氧化反应。

不同催化剂在活化CO2用于丙烷ODH方面的有效性各不相同。虽然文档没有提供关于V2O5、VOx/SiO2、CeO2或过渡金属簇的具体信息,但确实讨论了NiMo/Al2O3催化剂的使用。对于这种催化剂,CO2的活化涉及催化剂表面氧空位的补充。这一过程的能量障碍与N2O相似,但高于O2,使CO2成为一种更温和的氧化剂。

选择性氧化的建议机理涉及氢转移到催化剂表面的O-Mo物种,从而形成丁烯和丁二烯。相比之下,完全氧化发生在完全氧终止的表面上,通过O-Ni物种进行,产生裂解产物和COx。催化剂再生步骤包括表面氧物种与氢原子重组形成水,水脱附后创造一个空位,然后被气态氧化剂中的氧填充。

虽然文档没有提供CO2在不同催化剂上解离的具体能量障碍,但确实提到CO2的空位补充活化能与N2O相似,这表明在适当条件下CO2可以被有效活化用于ODH反应。

For redox-active catalysts like NiMo/Al2O3, the Mars-van Krevelen mechanism is typically observed. This involves the transfer of hydrogen atoms from the alkane to surface oxygen species (O-Mo in this case), followed by the regeneration of these oxygen vacancies using gaseous oxidants.

Traditional oxidants like O2 are highly reactive and tend to fully oxidize the catalyst surface, leading to lower selectivity towards desired products. CO2 and N2O, considered "soft oxidants," limit the formation of electrophilic oxygen species on the catalyst surface. This results in higher selectivity towards alkenes and alkadienes.

The effectiveness of different catalysts in activating CO2 for ODH of propane varies. While the study focuses on NiMo/Al2O3 for butane ODH, the principles can be extended to propane. Catalysts like V2O5, VOx/SiO2, CeO2, and transition metal clusters have been studied for CO2 activation in propane ODH. Their effectiveness depends on their ability to dissociate CO2 and create active oxygen species without over-oxidizing the catalyst surface.

The proposed mechanisms for CO2 dissociation often involve the formation of carbonate-like species on the catalyst surface, which then decompose to release an oxygen atom for the ODH reaction. The energy barriers for CO2 dissociation vary depending on the catalyst composition and structure. Catalysts that can efficiently dissociate CO2 at lower temperatures while maintaining selectivity towards desired products are considered more effective for CO2-assisted ODH reactions.

The mechanisms of C-H bond activation and catalyst regeneration in oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of alkanes differ between redox-active and redox-inactive metal oxide catalysts. 

For redox-active catalysts like vanadium oxides (V2O5, VOx/SiO2), the Mars-van Krevelen mechanism typically operates. In this mechanism, lattice oxygen from the catalyst participates in C-H bond activation, abstracting hydrogen from the alkane to form hydroxyl groups on the catalyst surface. The alkane is then dehydrogenated to form the corresponding alkene. The catalyst is regenerated by gaseous oxidants (O2, N2O, or CO2), which replenish the oxygen vacancies created during the reaction.

Redox-inactive catalysts like CeO2 cannot easily change their oxidation state, so they rely on different mechanisms for C-H activation. These often involve the formation of reactive oxygen species on the catalyst surface, which then abstract hydrogen from the alkane. The catalyst regeneration step is less critical for these materials, as they do not directly incorporate oxygen from the gas phase into their lattice.

Traditional oxidants like O2 are highly effective for catalyst regeneration but can lead to over-oxidation and decreased selectivity. CO2, as a milder oxidant, offers improved selectivity towards desired products like butadiene. However, CO2 activation is more challenging and often requires more active catalysts or higher temperatures.

For CO2-mediated ODH of propane, different catalysts show varying effectiveness:

1. V2O5 and VOx/SiO2: These catalysts can activate CO2, but the process is less efficient compared to O2. The proposed mechanism involves CO2 dissociation on oxygen vacancies, with higher energy barriers compared to O2 dissociation.

2. CeO2: This catalyst shows some ability to activate CO2, likely through the formation of surface carbonates. However, the activation barriers are generally higher than for vanadium-based catalysts.

3. Transition metal clusters: Some studies have shown that small clusters of transition metals (e.g., Pt, Pd) supported on metal oxides can effectively activate CO2 for ODH reactions. The proposed mechanisms often involve CO2 adsorption and dissociation on the metal clusters, followed by oxygen spillover to the support.

The effectiveness of these catalysts in activating CO2 for ODH reactions is generally lower than their effectiveness with O2, due to the higher stability of CO2. This results in higher energy barriers for CO2 dissociation and often requires higher reaction temperatures or more active catalyst formulations to achieve comparable performance to O2-mediated ODH.

对于钒氧化物(V2O5, VOx/SiO2)等氧化还原活性催化剂,通常遵循Mars-van Krevelen机理。在该机理中,催化剂的晶格氧参与C-H键活化,从烷烃中提取氢以在催化剂表面形成羟基。然后烷烃脱氢形成相应的烯烃。催化剂通过气相氧化剂(O2、N2O或CO2)再生,这些氧化剂补充反应过程中产生的氧空位。

CeO2等非氧化还原活性催化剂不能轻易改变其氧化态,因此它们依赖于不同的C-H活化机理。这些机理通常涉及在催化剂表面形成活性氧物种,然后从烷烃中提取氢。对这些材料而言,催化剂再生步骤不那么关键,因为它们不直接将气相中的氧掺入晶格。

传统的氧化剂如O2对催化剂再生非常有效,但可能导致过度氧化和选择性降低。CO2作为一种较温和的氧化剂,可以提高对目标产物(如丁二烯)的选择性。然而,CO2的活化更具挑战性,通常需要更活泼的催化剂或更高的温度。

对于CO2介导的丙烷ODH反应,不同催化剂显示出不同的有效性:

1. V2O5和VOx/SiO2:这些催化剂可以活化CO2,但效率比O2低。提出的机理涉及CO2在氧空位上解离,与O2解离相比具有更高的能量障碍。

2. CeO2:该催化剂显示出一定的CO2活化能力,可能通过形成表面碳酸盐。然而,活化障碍通常高于钒基催化剂。

3. 过渡金属簇:一些研究表明,负载在金属氧化物上的小型过渡金属簇(如Pt、Pd)可以有效地活化CO2用于ODH反应。提出的机理通常涉及CO2在金属簇上吸附和解离,随后氧溢流到载体上。

这些催化剂在活化CO2用于ODH反应方面的有效性通常低于使用O2时的有效性,这是由于CO2的稳定性较高。这导致CO2解离的能量障碍较高,通常需要更高的反应温度或更活泼的催化剂配方才能达到与O2介导的ODH相当的性能。
