[1] "The oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) reaction of n-butane with different oxidant species: O2, CO2 and N2O. The effect of the lattice oxygen mobility and storage in NiMo/Al2O3 on catalytic conversion performance was investigated."

[2] "Using soft oxidants like N2O and CO2 limits the formation of electrophilic oxygen species, which promote the oxidation of alkenes to carbon oxides, on the surface of the catalyst, thereby increasing the selectivity towards butadiene."

[3] "TPRO profiles showed N2O had a stronger adsorption capability on the surface of the catalyst compared to CO2 and O2 and that it facilitates easier migration of lattice oxygen from bulk to surface to complete the oxidation process."

[4] "Selective oxidation of butane to butenes and, ultimately, butadiene proceeds with the transfer of hydrogens to O-Mo species on the catalyst. Total oxidation proceeds on fully oxygen-terminated surface via O-Ni species and yields cracked products and COx."

[5] "As typical for Mars van Krevelen mechanism, surface oxygen species (O-Mo and O-Ni) are recovered via recombination with two hydrogen atoms to water molecule, its desorption and the replenishment of the ensuing vacancy with oxygen from gaseous oxidant (O2, N2O, or CO2)."

The mechanisms of C-H bond activation and catalyst regeneration in oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of alkanes differ between redox-active and redox-inactive metal oxide catalysts. For redox-active catalysts like NiMo/Al2O3, the Mars-van Krevelen mechanism is typically observed. This involves the transfer of hydrogen atoms from the alkane to surface oxygen species (O-Mo in this case), followed by the regeneration of these oxygen vacancies using gaseous oxidants.

Traditional oxidants like O2 are highly reactive and tend to fully oxidize the catalyst surface, leading to lower selectivity towards desired products. CO2 and N2O, considered "soft oxidants," limit the formation of electrophilic oxygen species on the catalyst surface. This results in higher selectivity towards alkenes and alkadienes.

The effectiveness of different catalysts in activating CO2 for ODH of propane varies. While the study focuses on NiMo/Al2O3 for butane ODH, the principles can be extended to propane. Catalysts like V2O5, VOx/SiO2, CeO2, and transition metal clusters have been studied for CO2 activation in propane ODH. Their effectiveness depends on their ability to dissociate CO2 and create active oxygen species without over-oxidizing the catalyst surface.

The proposed mechanisms for CO2 dissociation often involve the formation of carbonate-like species on the catalyst surface, which then decompose to release an oxygen atom for the ODH reaction. The energy barriers for CO2 dissociation vary depending on the catalyst composition and structure. Catalysts that can efficiently dissociate CO2 at lower temperatures while maintaining selectivity towards desired products are considered more effective for CO2-assisted ODH reactions.

烷烃氧化脱氢(ODH)反应中C-H键活化和催化剂再生的机理在氧化还原活性和非活性金属氧化物催化剂之间有所不同。对于像NiMo/Al2O3这样的氧化还原活性催化剂,通常遵循Mars-van Krevelen机理。这涉及将氢原子从烷烃转移到表面氧物种(在这种情况下是O-Mo),然后使用气态氧化剂再生这些氧空位。

像O2这样的传统氧化剂反应活性很高,倾向于完全氧化催化剂表面,导致目标产物的选择性降低。CO2和N2O被认为是"软氧化剂",限制了催化剂表面亲电氧物种的形成。这导致烯烃和二烯烃的选择性更高。

不同催化剂在活化CO2用于丙烷ODH方面的有效性各不相同。虽然该研究focused on NiMo/Al2O3用于丁烷ODH,但这些原理可以扩展到丙烷。V2O5、VOx/SiO2、CeO2和过渡金属簇等催化剂已被研究用于丙烷ODH中的CO2活化。它们的有效性取决于它们分解CO2和创建活性氧物种的能力,而不会过度氧化催化剂表面。

CO2分解的提议机理通常涉及在催化剂表面形成类碳酸盐物种,然后分解释放氧原子用于ODH反应。CO2分解的能垒因催化剂组成和结构而异。能够在较低温度下有效分解CO2同时保持对目标产物选择性的催化剂被认为更适合CO2辅助ODH反应。
