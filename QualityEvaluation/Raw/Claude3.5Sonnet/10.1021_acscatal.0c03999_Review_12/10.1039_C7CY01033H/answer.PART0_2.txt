[4] "Using soft oxidants like N2O and CO2 limits the formation of electrophilic oxygen species, which promote the oxidation of alkenes to carbon oxides, on the surface of the catalyst, thereby increasing the selectivity towards butadiene."

[5] "Selective oxidation of butane to butenes and, ultimately, butadiene proceeds with the transfer of hydrogens to O-Mo species on the catalyst. Total oxidation proceeds on fully oxygen-terminated surface via O-Ni species and yields cracked products and COx."

[6] "As typical for Mars van Krevelen mechanism, surface oxygen species (O-Mo and O-Ni) are recovered via recombination with two hydrogen atoms to water molecule, its desorption and the replenishment of the ensuing vacancy with oxygen from gaseous oxidant (O2, N2O, or CO2)."

The mechanisms of C-H bond activation and catalyst regeneration in oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of alkanes differ between redox-active and redox-inactive metal oxide catalysts. For redox-active catalysts like NiMo/Al2O3, the Mars-van Krevelen mechanism is typically followed. This involves the transfer of hydrogen atoms from the alkane to surface oxygen species, followed by the regeneration of these oxygen species through the oxidant.

Traditional oxidants like O2 are highly reactive and can lead to over-oxidation, resulting in the formation of carbon oxides. In contrast, soft oxidants like CO2 and N2O offer improved selectivity towards desired products like butadiene. This is because they limit the formation of electrophilic oxygen species on the catalyst surface, which are responsible for undesired total oxidation reactions.

The effectiveness of different catalysts in activating CO2 for ODH of propane varies. While the document doesn't provide specific information on V2O5, VOx/SiO2, CeO2, or transition metal clusters, it does discuss the use of NiMo/Al2O3 catalyst. For this catalyst, CO2 activation involves the replenishment of oxygen vacancies on the catalyst surface. The energy barrier for this process with CO2 is similar to that of N2O, but higher than O2, making CO2 a milder oxidant.

The proposed mechanism for selective oxidation involves the transfer of hydrogens to O-Mo species on the catalyst surface, leading to the formation of butenes and butadiene. In contrast, total oxidation occurs on fully oxygen-terminated surfaces via O-Ni species, resulting in cracked products and COx. The catalyst regeneration step involves the recombination of surface oxygen species with hydrogen atoms to form water, which desorbs, creating a vacancy that is then filled by oxygen from the gaseous oxidant.

While the document doesn't provide specific energy barriers for CO2 dissociation on different catalysts, it does mention that the activation energy for vacancy replenishment with CO2 is similar to that of N2O, suggesting that CO2 can be effectively activated for ODH reactions under appropriate conditions.

烷烃氧化脱氢(ODH)中C-H键活化和催化剂再生的机理在氧化还原活性和非活性金属氧化物催化剂之间有所不同。对于像NiMo/Al2O3这样的氧化还原活性催化剂,通常遵循Mars-van Krevelen机理。这涉及氢原子从烷烃转移到表面氧物种,然后通过氧化剂再生这些氧物种。

传统的氧化剂如O2反应性很高,可能导致过度氧化,形成碳氧化物。相比之下,CO2和N2O等软氧化剂可以提高对目标产物(如丁二烯)的选择性。这是因为它们限制了催化剂表面亲电氧物种的形成,这些物种会导致不需要的完全氧化反应。

不同催化剂在活化CO2用于丙烷ODH方面的有效性各不相同。虽然文档没有提供关于V2O5、VOx/SiO2、CeO2或过渡金属簇的具体信息,但确实讨论了NiMo/Al2O3催化剂的使用。对于这种催化剂,CO2的活化涉及催化剂表面氧空位的补充。这一过程的能量障碍与N2O相似,但高于O2,使CO2成为一种更温和的氧化剂。

选择性氧化的建议机理涉及氢转移到催化剂表面的O-Mo物种,从而形成丁烯和丁二烯。相比之下,完全氧化发生在完全氧终止的表面上,通过O-Ni物种进行,产生裂解产物和COx。催化剂再生步骤包括表面氧物种与氢原子重组形成水,水脱附后创造一个空位,然后被气态氧化剂中的氧填充。

虽然文档没有提供CO2在不同催化剂上解离的具体能量障碍,但确实提到CO2的空位补充活化能与N2O相似,这表明在适当条件下CO2可以被有效活化用于ODH反应。
