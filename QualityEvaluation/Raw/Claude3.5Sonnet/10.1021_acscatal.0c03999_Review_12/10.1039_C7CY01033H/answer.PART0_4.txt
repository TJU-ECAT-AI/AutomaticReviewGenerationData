[1] "On the other hand, oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of n-butane usually gives a lower yield of coke and cracking products because the reaction is exothermic"

[2] "The oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of n-butane to butene and 1,3-butadiene follows the Marsvan Krevelen mechanism, as also reported by several researchers"

[3] "Using soft oxidants like N2O and CO2 limits the formation of electrophilic oxygen species, which promote the oxidation of alkenes to carbon oxides, on the surface of the catalyst, thereby increasing the selectivity towards butadiene."

[4] "As typical for Mars van Krevelen mechanism, surface oxygen species (O-Mo and O-Ni) are recovered via recombination with two hydrogen atoms to water molecule, its desorption and the replenishment of the ensuing vacancy with oxygen from gaseous oxidant (O2, N2O, or CO2)."

[5] "Selective oxidation of butane to butenes and, ultimately, butadiene proceeds with the transfer of hydrogens to O-Mo species on the catalyst. Total oxidation proceeds on fully oxygen-terminated surface via O-Ni species and yields cracked products and COx."

The mechanisms of C-H bond activation and catalyst regeneration in oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of alkanes differ between redox-active and redox-inactive metal oxide catalysts. 

For redox-active catalysts like vanadium oxides (V2O5, VOx/SiO2), the Mars-van Krevelen mechanism typically operates. In this mechanism, lattice oxygen from the catalyst participates in C-H bond activation, abstracting hydrogen from the alkane to form hydroxyl groups on the catalyst surface. The alkane is then dehydrogenated to form the corresponding alkene. The catalyst is regenerated by gaseous oxidants (O2, N2O, or CO2), which replenish the oxygen vacancies created during the reaction.

Redox-inactive catalysts like CeO2 cannot easily change their oxidation state, so they rely on different mechanisms for C-H activation. These often involve the formation of reactive oxygen species on the catalyst surface, which then abstract hydrogen from the alkane. The catalyst regeneration step is less critical for these materials, as they do not directly incorporate oxygen from the gas phase into their lattice.

Traditional oxidants like O2 are highly effective for catalyst regeneration but can lead to over-oxidation and decreased selectivity. CO2, as a milder oxidant, offers improved selectivity towards desired products like butadiene. However, CO2 activation is more challenging and often requires more active catalysts or higher temperatures.

For CO2-mediated ODH of propane, different catalysts show varying effectiveness:

1. V2O5 and VOx/SiO2: These catalysts can activate CO2, but the process is less efficient compared to O2. The proposed mechanism involves CO2 dissociation on oxygen vacancies, with higher energy barriers compared to O2 dissociation.

2. CeO2: This catalyst shows some ability to activate CO2, likely through the formation of surface carbonates. However, the activation barriers are generally higher than for vanadium-based catalysts.

3. Transition metal clusters: Some studies have shown that small clusters of transition metals (e.g., Pt, Pd) supported on metal oxides can effectively activate CO2 for ODH reactions. The proposed mechanisms often involve CO2 adsorption and dissociation on the metal clusters, followed by oxygen spillover to the support.

The effectiveness of these catalysts in activating CO2 for ODH reactions is generally lower than their effectiveness with O2, due to the higher stability of CO2. This results in higher energy barriers for CO2 dissociation and often requires higher reaction temperatures or more active catalyst formulations to achieve comparable performance to O2-mediated ODH.

烷烃氧化脱氢(ODH)反应中C-H键活化和催化剂再生的机理在氧化还原活性和非氧化还原活性金属氧化物催化剂之间存在差异。

对于钒氧化物(V2O5, VOx/SiO2)等氧化还原活性催化剂,通常遵循Mars-van Krevelen机理。在该机理中,催化剂的晶格氧参与C-H键活化,从烷烃中提取氢以在催化剂表面形成羟基。然后烷烃脱氢形成相应的烯烃。催化剂通过气相氧化剂(O2、N2O或CO2)再生,这些氧化剂补充反应过程中产生的氧空位。

CeO2等非氧化还原活性催化剂不能轻易改变其氧化态,因此它们依赖于不同的C-H活化机理。这些机理通常涉及在催化剂表面形成活性氧物种,然后从烷烃中提取氢。对这些材料而言,催化剂再生步骤不那么关键,因为它们不直接将气相中的氧掺入晶格。

传统的氧化剂如O2对催化剂再生非常有效,但可能导致过度氧化和选择性降低。CO2作为一种较温和的氧化剂,可以提高对目标产物(如丁二烯)的选择性。然而,CO2的活化更具挑战性,通常需要更活泼的催化剂或更高的温度。

对于CO2介导的丙烷ODH反应,不同催化剂显示出不同的有效性:

1. V2O5和VOx/SiO2:这些催化剂可以活化CO2,但效率比O2低。提出的机理涉及CO2在氧空位上解离,与O2解离相比具有更高的能量障碍。

2. CeO2:该催化剂显示出一定的CO2活化能力,可能通过形成表面碳酸盐。然而,活化障碍通常高于钒基催化剂。

3. 过渡金属簇:一些研究表明,负载在金属氧化物上的小型过渡金属簇(如Pt、Pd)可以有效地活化CO2用于ODH反应。提出的机理通常涉及CO2在金属簇上吸附和解离,随后氧溢流到载体上。

这些催化剂在活化CO2用于ODH反应方面的有效性通常低于使用O2时的有效性,这是由于CO2的稳定性较高。这导致CO2解离的能量障碍较高,通常需要更高的反应温度或更活泼的催化剂配方才能达到与O2介导的ODH相当的性能。
