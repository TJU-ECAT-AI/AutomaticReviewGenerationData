          "The oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of n-butane to butene and 1,3-butadiene follows the Marsvan Krevelen mechanism, as also reported by several researchers"

"Selective oxidation of butane to butenes and, ultimately, butadiene proceeds with the transfer of hydrogens to O-Mo species on the catalyst. Total oxidation proceeds on fully oxygen-terminated surface via O-Ni species and yields cracked products and COx."

"As typical for Mars van Krevelen mechanism, surface oxygen species (O-Mo and O-Ni) are recovered via recombination with two hydrogen atoms to water molecule, its desorption and the replenishment of the ensuing vacancy with oxygen from gaseous oxidant (O2, N2O, or CO2)."

"CO2 and N2O have been reported as soft oxidants for ODH of light alkanes"

"Using soft oxidants like N2O and CO2 limits the formation of electrophilic oxygen species, which promote the oxidation of alkenes to carbon oxides, on the surface of the catalyst, thereby increasing the selectivity towards butadiene."

          The mechanisms of C-H bond activation and catalyst regeneration in oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of alkanes differ between redox-active and redox-inactive metal oxide catalysts. 

For redox-active catalysts like NiMo/Al2O3, the Mars-van Krevelen mechanism is typically followed. This involves the abstraction of hydrogen from the alkane by lattice oxygen (e.g., O-Mo species), followed by catalyst reoxidation by gas-phase oxidants. The process involves:
1. Transfer of hydrogens to surface oxygen species (e.g., O-Mo)
2. Formation of water molecules
3. Desorption of water, creating oxygen vacancies
4. Replenishment of vacancies with oxygen from gaseous oxidants (O2, N2O, or CO2)

Redox-inactive catalysts operate through different mechanisms, often involving the formation of active oxygen species on the catalyst surface.

Traditional oxidants like O2 are highly reactive but can lead to over-oxidation and lower selectivity. CO2 and N2O, considered "soft oxidants," offer improved selectivity by limiting the formation of electrophilic oxygen species that promote total oxidation. This results in higher selectivity towards desired products like butadiene.

The effectiveness of catalysts in activating CO2 for ODH varies. While specific information on V2O5, VOx/SiO2, CeO2, or transition metal clusters is not provided, the general principle is that catalysts capable of efficiently dissociating CO2 and creating active oxygen species without over-oxidizing the surface are considered more effective for CO2-assisted ODH reactions.

          烷烃氧化脱氢(ODH)反应中C-H键活化和催化剂再生的机理在氧化还原活性和非活性金属氧化物催化剂之间存在差异。

对于NiMo/Al2O3等氧化还原活性催化剂,通常遵循Mars-van Krevelen机理。这涉及晶格氧(例如O-Mo物种)从烷烃中夺取氢,然后催化剂被气相氧化剂重新氧化。该过程包括:
1. 氢转移到表面氧物种(例如O-Mo)
2. 形成水分子
3. 水脱附,创造氧空位
4. 用气态氧化剂(O2、N2O或CO2)中的氧填充空位

非氧化还原活性催化剂通过不同的机理运作,通常涉及在催化剂表面形成活性氧物种。

O2等传统氧化剂反应性很高,但可能导致过度氧化和选择性降低。CO2和N2O被认为是"软氧化剂",通过限制促进完全氧化的亲电氧物种的形成,提高了选择性。这导致对目标产物(如丁二烯)的选择性更高。

催化剂在活化CO2用于ODH方面的有效性各不相同。虽然没有提供关于V2O5、VOx/SiO2、CeO2或过渡金属簇的具体信息,但一般原则是能够有效解离CO2并创造活性氧物种而不过度氧化表面的催化剂被认为更适合CO2辅助ODH反应。
