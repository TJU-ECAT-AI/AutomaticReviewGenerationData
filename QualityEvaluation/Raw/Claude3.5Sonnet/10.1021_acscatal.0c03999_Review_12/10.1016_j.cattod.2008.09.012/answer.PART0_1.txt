[1] "For all the reactions studied, olefin selectivity was significantly improved upon replacing O2 with N2O. This is due to suppressing COx formation in the presence of N2O."

[2] "Possible origins of the superior performance of N2O were derived from transient experiments using 18O2 traces. 18O16O species were detected in 18O2 and 18O2C3H8 transient experiments indicating reversible oxygen chemisorption."

[3] "Based on the distribution of labeled oxygen in COx and in O2 as well as on the increased COx formation in sequential O2C3H8 experiments, it is suggested that non-lattice oxygen species (possibly of a bi-atomic nature) originating from O2 are non-selective ones and responsible for COx formation. These species are not formed from N2O."

[4] "Alkanes react with oxidized VOx species yielding reduced ones. The reduced VOx species are reoxidized by N2O resulting in gas-phase N2 and restoring lattice oxygen species."

[5] "Recent DFT calculations of interaction of O2 and N2O with reduced and oxidized VOx species suggest that peroxo species are formed upon interaction of O2 but not N2O with reduced VOx species [26]. These bi-atomic oxygen species are further transformed to lattice oxygen ones. The latter species are also formed upon reoxidation of reduced VOx species by N2O."

The literature does not directly compare redox-active and redox-inactive metal oxide catalysts for oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of alkanes. It primarily focuses on VOx species supported on MCM-41 and compares the use of O2 and N2O as oxidants. However, based on the information provided, we can infer some insights about the mechanisms:

For redox-active catalysts like VOx:

1. C-H bond activation: Alkanes react with oxidized VOx species, reducing them and forming olefins.

2. Catalyst regeneration: Reduced VOx species are reoxidized by the oxidant (O2 or N2O), restoring lattice oxygen.

3. O2 vs N2O: O2 forms non-selective bi-atomic oxygen species (possibly peroxo species) responsible for COx formation, while N2O does not form these species, leading to higher olefin selectivity.

The document does not discuss redox-inactive catalysts or the use of CO2 as an oxidant for ODH. It also does not mention specific catalysts like CeO2 or transition metal clusters for CO2 activation in propane ODH.

Regarding the effectiveness of different catalysts in activating CO2 for ODH of propane, the literature does not provide information on this topic. The study focuses on comparing O2 and N2O as oxidants for VOx/MCM-41 catalysts, without discussing CO2 activation or other catalyst types.

该文献并未直接比较氧化还原活性和非活性金属氧化物催化剂在烷烃氧化脱氢(ODH)中的作用。它主要关注了负载在MCM-41上的VOx物种，并比较了O2和N2O作为氧化剂的使用。然而，根据所提供的信息，我们可以推断出一些关于机理的见解：

对于像VOx这样的氧化还原活性催化剂：

1. C-H键活化：烷烃与氧化态VOx物种反应，将其还原并形成烯烃。

2. 催化剂再生：还原态VOx物种被氧化剂(O2或N2O)重新氧化，恢复晶格氧。

3. O2与N2O对比：O2形成非选择性的双原子氧物种(可能是过氧物种)，负责COx的形成，而N2O不形成这些物种，从而导致更高的烯烃选择性。

该文档没有讨论氧化还原非活性催化剂或CO2作为ODH氧化剂的使用。它也没有提到特定的催化剂，如CeO2或过渡金属簇在丙烷ODH中活化CO2的情况。

关于不同催化剂在活化CO2用于丙烷ODH的效果，文献没有提供这方面的信息。该研究集中于比较O2和N2O作为VOx/MCM-41催化剂的氧化剂，没有讨论CO2的活化或其他催化剂类型。
