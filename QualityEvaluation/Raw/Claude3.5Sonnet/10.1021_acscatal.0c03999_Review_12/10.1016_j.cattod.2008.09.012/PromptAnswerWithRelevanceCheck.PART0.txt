[1] "Irrespective of the alkane and the oxidant applied, the overall rate of alkane conversion increases with a decrease in the strength of the weakest CH bond in the alkane molecule indicating that alkane activation is the rate-limiting step."

[2] "Upon replacing O2 with N2O, the overall activity decreases but the olefin selectivity increases. The selectivity increase is due to suppressing non-selective production of CO and CO2 via direct alkane combustion and consecutive alkene oxidation."

[3] "Transient experiments in the TAP reactor and in a SSITKA set up evidenced, that N2O does not decompose over oxidized VOx species in the absence of alkane, while heterogenenous oxygen isotopic exchange between gas-phase 18O2 and lattice 16O of VOx species takes place yielding 18O16O."

[4] "Both, the decomposition of N2O and the oxygen isotopic exchange are significantly accelerated in the presence of alkanes indicating that reduced VOx species are more reactive for these processes than the oxidized ones."

[5] "TAP results, and SSITKA data consistent with Mar-van-Krevelen mechanism, where selective, and non-selective reactions occur on lattice oxygen of VOx species. This is valid for O2- and N2O-containing feeds."

[6] "O2 and C3H8 sequential pulsing in the TAP reactor and 16O2C3H8/18O2C3H8 SSITKA experiment indicate that COx formation in the presence of O2 involves additional another type of oxygen species. These oxygen species are assumed to be of molecular nature and are not formed from N2O. This may be a reason of the superior performance of N2O over O2."

The literature does not directly compare redox-active and redox-inactive metal oxide catalysts or discuss CO2 as an oxidant for oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of alkanes. However, we can extract some information about the mechanisms of C-H bond activation and catalyst regeneration for VOx catalysts using O2 and N2O as oxidants:

1. C-H bond activation: The rate-limiting step in ODH is the activation of the weakest C-H bond in the alkane molecule. This step occurs on the catalyst surface and is independent of the oxidant used.

2. Catalyst regeneration: The regeneration mechanism differs between O2 and N2O:
   - With O2: Oxygen isotopic exchange experiments show that O2 dissociatively adsorbs on oxidized VOx species, forming lattice oxygen. This process is reversible.
   - With N2O: N2O does not decompose on oxidized VOx species in the absence of alkanes. However, reduced VOx species (formed after C-H activation) can decompose N2O, regenerating the catalyst.

3. Reaction mechanism: Both O2 and N2O follow a Mars-van Krevelen mechanism, where lattice oxygen participates in selective and non-selective reactions.

4. Selectivity differences: N2O shows superior performance compared to O2 in terms of olefin selectivity. This is attributed to the suppression of non-selective CO and CO2 formation. With O2, additional oxygen species (possibly molecular in nature) are formed, which contribute to non-selective oxidation. These species are not formed with N2O, explaining its higher selectivity.

5. Catalyst state effects: Reduced VOx species are more reactive than oxidized ones for both N2O decomposition and oxygen isotopic exchange.

The literature does not provide information on CO2 activation or its use as an oxidant for ODH of propane, nor does it discuss other catalysts like CeO2 or transition metal clusters in this context.

该文献并未直接比较氧化还原活性和非氧化还原活性的金属氧化物催化剂，也没有讨论CO2作为烷烃氧化脱氢(ODH)的氧化剂。但是，我们可以提取一些关于使用O2和N2O作为氧化剂的VOx催化剂的C-H键活化和催化剂再生机理的信息：

1. C-H键活化：ODH的限速步骤是烷烃分子中最弱C-H键的活化。这一步骤发生在催化剂表面，与所使用的氧化剂无关。

2. 催化剂再生：O2和N2O的再生机理不同：
   - 对于O2：氧同位素交换实验表明，O2在氧化的VOx物种上解离吸附，形成晶格氧。这个过程是可逆的。
   - 对于N2O：在没有烷烃的情况下，N2O不会在氧化的VOx物种上分解。但是，还原的VOx物种（在C-H活化后形成）可以分解N2O，从而再生催化剂。

3. 反应机理：O2和N2O都遵循Mars-van Krevelen机理，其中晶格氧参与选择性和非选择性反应。

4. 选择性差异：与O2相比，N2O在烯烃选择性方面表现更优。这归因于抑制了非选择性CO和CO2的形成。使用O2时，会形成额外的氧物种（可能是分子性质的），这些物种会导致非选择性氧化。使用N2O时不会形成这些物种，这解释了其更高的选择性。

5. 催化剂状态效应：对于N2O分解和氧同位素交换，还原态的VOx物种比氧化态的更具反应活性。

该文献没有提供关于CO2活化或将其用作丙烷ODH氧化剂的信息，也没有在这方面讨论其他催化剂如CeO2或过渡金属簇。

[1] "For all the reactions studied, olefin selectivity was significantly improved upon replacing O2 with N2O. This is due to suppressing COx formation in the presence of N2O."

[2] "Possible origins of the superior performance of N2O were derived from transient experiments using 18O2 traces. 18O16O species were detected in 18O2 and 18O2C3H8 transient experiments indicating reversible oxygen chemisorption."

[3] "Based on the distribution of labeled oxygen in COx and in O2 as well as on the increased COx formation in sequential O2C3H8 experiments, it is suggested that non-lattice oxygen species (possibly of a bi-atomic nature) originating from O2 are non-selective ones and responsible for COx formation. These species are not formed from N2O."

[4] "Alkanes react with oxidized VOx species yielding reduced ones. The reduced VOx species are reoxidized by N2O resulting in gas-phase N2 and restoring lattice oxygen species."

[5] "Recent DFT calculations of interaction of O2 and N2O with reduced and oxidized VOx species suggest that peroxo species are formed upon interaction of O2 but not N2O with reduced VOx species [26]. These bi-atomic oxygen species are further transformed to lattice oxygen ones. The latter species are also formed upon reoxidation of reduced VOx species by N2O."

The literature does not directly compare redox-active and redox-inactive metal oxide catalysts for oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of alkanes. It primarily focuses on VOx species supported on MCM-41 and compares the use of O2 and N2O as oxidants. However, based on the information provided, we can infer some insights about the mechanisms:

For redox-active catalysts like VOx:

1. C-H bond activation: Alkanes react with oxidized VOx species, reducing them and forming olefins.

2. Catalyst regeneration: Reduced VOx species are reoxidized by the oxidant (O2 or N2O), restoring lattice oxygen.

3. O2 vs N2O: O2 forms non-selective bi-atomic oxygen species (possibly peroxo species) responsible for COx formation, while N2O does not form these species, leading to higher olefin selectivity.

The document does not discuss redox-inactive catalysts or the use of CO2 as an oxidant for ODH. It also does not mention specific catalysts like CeO2 or transition metal clusters for CO2 activation in propane ODH.

Regarding the effectiveness of different catalysts in activating CO2 for ODH of propane, the literature does not provide information on this topic. The study focuses on comparing O2 and N2O as oxidants for VOx/MCM-41 catalysts, without discussing CO2 activation or other catalyst types.

该文献并未直接比较氧化还原活性和非活性金属氧化物催化剂在烷烃氧化脱氢(ODH)中的作用。它主要关注了负载在MCM-41上的VOx物种，并比较了O2和N2O作为氧化剂的使用。然而，根据所提供的信息，我们可以推断出一些关于机理的见解：

对于像VOx这样的氧化还原活性催化剂：

1. C-H键活化：烷烃与氧化态VOx物种反应，将其还原并形成烯烃。

2. 催化剂再生：还原态VOx物种被氧化剂(O2或N2O)重新氧化，恢复晶格氧。

3. O2与N2O对比：O2形成非选择性的双原子氧物种(可能是过氧物种)，负责COx的形成，而N2O不形成这些物种，从而导致更高的烯烃选择性。

该文档没有讨论氧化还原非活性催化剂或CO2作为ODH氧化剂的使用。它也没有提到特定的催化剂，如CeO2或过渡金属簇在丙烷ODH中活化CO2的情况。

关于不同催化剂在活化CO2用于丙烷ODH的效果，文献没有提供这方面的信息。该研究集中于比较O2和N2O作为VOx/MCM-41催化剂的氧化剂，没有讨论CO2的活化或其他催化剂类型。

The literature does not directly compare redox-active and redox-inactive metal oxide catalysts for oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of alkanes. It primarily focuses on VOx/MCM-41 catalysts using O2 and N2O as oxidants. However, some insights can be drawn from the provided information:

For VOx catalysts (redox-active):

1. C-H bond activation: The rate of alkane conversion correlates with the strength of the weakest C-H bond, suggesting that breaking this bond is the rate-limiting step in ODH reactions.

2. Catalyst regeneration: Reduced VOx species are reoxidized by the oxidant (O2 or N2O), restoring lattice oxygen. N2O decomposition is more efficient on reduced VOx species.

3. Oxidant comparison: N2O leads to higher olefin selectivity and lower COx formation compared to O2. This is attributed to N2O's inability to form peroxo species, which are thought to be responsible for non-selective oxidation.

The literature does not discuss CO2 as an oxidant or compare different catalyst types (V2O5, VOx/SiO2, CeO2, transition metal clusters) for CO2 activation in propane ODH. It also doesn't provide information on energy barriers for CO2 dissociation.

In general, the mechanism involves alkane activation by lattice oxygen, followed by catalyst reoxidation. The choice of oxidant significantly impacts selectivity, with N2O offering superior performance due to its inability to form highly reactive oxygen species that lead to overoxidation.

该文献并未直接比较氧化还原活性和非活性金属氧化物催化剂在烷烃氧化脱氢(ODH)中的表现。它主要集中于使用O2和N2O作为氧化剂的VOx/MCM-41催化剂。然而，从所提供的信息中可以得出一些见解：

对于VOx催化剂（氧化还原活性）：

1. C-H键活化：烷烃转化率与最弱C-H键强度相关，表明在ODH反应中断裂该键是限速步骤。

2. 催化剂再生：还原态VOx物种被氧化剂（O2或N2O）重新氧化，恢复晶格氧。N2O在还原态VOx物种上的分解更有效。

3. 氧化剂比较：与O2相比，N2O导致更高的烯烃选择性和更低的COx生成。这归因于N2O无法形成过氧物种，而过氧物种被认为是非选择性氧化的原因。

该文献未讨论CO2作为氧化剂，也未比较不同类型催化剂（V2O5、VOx/SiO2、CeO2、过渡金属簇）在丙烷ODH中活化CO2的情况。它也没有提供CO2解离的能量障碍信息。

总的来说，机理涉及烷烃被晶格氧活化，随后催化剂被重新氧化。氧化剂的选择显著影响选择性，N2O由于无法形成导致过度氧化的高活性氧物种，因此表现出更优异的性能。

It is important to highlight that the same order is also valid for the strength of the weakest CH bond in these alkanes [15,16]. Considering both experimental facts, it is suggested that the breaking of the weakest CH bond limits the ODH reaction over highly dispersed VOx species independent of the oxidant applied."

[2] "Irrespective of the alkane applied, two important improving effects of N2O have been identified for the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane, propane, n-butane and iso-butane: (i) higher primary olefin selectivity, and (ii) lower decrease in olefin selectivity with increasing alkane conversion, i.e. lower ability for consecutive alkene overoxidation."

The literature does not directly compare redox-active and redox-inactive metal oxide catalysts for oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of alkanes, nor does it discuss CO2 as an oxidant or the effectiveness of catalysts like CeO2 and transition metal clusters. However, it does provide some insights into the mechanisms of C-H bond activation and catalyst regeneration for VOx catalysts using O2 and N2O as oxidants.

For VOx catalysts, the breaking of the weakest C-H bond in the alkane molecule appears to be the rate-limiting step in ODH reactions, regardless of the oxidant used (O2 or N2O). This is evidenced by the correlation between alkane reactivity order and the strength of the weakest C-H bond.

The catalyst regeneration mechanism follows a Mars-van Krevelen type process, where both selective and non-selective reactions occur on lattice oxygen of VOx species. This is true for both O2 and N2O oxidants. However, O2 appears to form additional oxygen species (possibly of molecular nature) that are not formed from N2O. These additional species contribute to COx formation, explaining why N2O shows superior performance as an oxidant in terms of olefin selectivity.

N2O demonstrates two key advantages over O2 in ODH reactions: (1) higher primary olefin selectivity, and (2) lower decrease in olefin selectivity with increasing alkane conversion. This suggests that N2O is less prone to causing consecutive alkene overoxidation compared to O2.

The study does not provide information on CO2 activation or its use as an oxidant in ODH reactions. Similarly, it does not discuss other catalysts like CeO2 or transition metal clusters, focusing primarily on VOx species supported on MCM-41.

该文献并未直接比较氧化还原活性和非活性金属氧化物催化剂在烷烃氧化脱氢(ODH)中的表现，也没有讨论CO2作为氧化剂的使用，或者CeO2和过渡金属簇等催化剂的效果。然而，它确实提供了一些关于VOx催化剂使用O2和N2O作为氧化剂时C-H键活化和催化剂再生机制的见解。

对于VOx催化剂，无论使用何种氧化剂（O2或N2O），烷烃分子中最弱C-H键的断裂似乎是ODH反应的限速步骤。这一点从烷烃反应活性顺序与最弱C-H键强度的相关性中得到证实。

催化剂再生机制遵循Mars-van Krevelen类型过程，其中选择性和非选择性反应都发生在VOx物种的晶格氧上。这对O2和N2O氧化剂都适用。然而，O2似乎形成了额外的氧物种（可能是分子性质的），这些物种不是由N2O形成的。这些额外的物种导致COx的形成，解释了为什么N2O作为氧化剂在烯烃选择性方面表现更优。

N2O在ODH反应中显示出两个关键优势：(1)更高的初级烯烃选择性，(2)随着烷烃转化率增加，烯烃选择性降低的程度较小。这表明与O2相比，N2O不太容易导致连续的烯烃过度氧化。

该研究没有提供关于CO2活化或其作为ODH反应中氧化剂使用的信息。同样，它也没有讨论其他催化剂如CeO2或过渡金属簇，主要集中在支持在MCM-41上的VOx物种。

The literature does not directly compare redox-active and redox-inactive metal oxide catalysts for oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of alkanes. However, it provides insights into the mechanism of ODH using VOx species, which are redox-active catalysts.

For VOx catalysts, C-H bond activation appears to be the rate-limiting step in ODH reactions. The reactivity of alkanes increases as the strength of the weakest C-H bond decreases, following the order C2H6 < C3H8 < n-C4H10 < iso-C4H10.

Catalyst regeneration occurs through reoxidation of reduced VOx species. With O2 as the oxidant, this process can form peroxo species, which are highly reactive and contribute to non-selective oxidation. When N2O is used instead, it directly restores lattice oxygen without forming these reactive intermediates, leading to improved selectivity.

The literature does not discuss CO2 as an oxidant or compare different catalysts like V2O5, VOx/SiO2, CeO2, and transition metal clusters for CO2 activation in propane ODH. It also does not mention proposed mechanisms or energy barriers for CO2 dissociation.

In summary, while the document provides valuable information on the ODH mechanism using VOx catalysts with O2 and N2O as oxidants, it does not address all aspects of the question, particularly regarding redox-inactive catalysts, CO2 as an oxidant, and comparisons between different catalyst types for CO2 activation.

该文献并未直接比较氧化脱氢(ODH)反应中氧化还原活性和非活性金属氧化物催化剂。然而，它提供了使用VOx物种（氧化还原活性催化剂）进行ODH的机理见解。

对于VOx催化剂，C-H键活化似乎是ODH反应的限速步骤。烷烃的反应活性随最弱C-H键强度的降低而增加，顺序为C2H6 < C3H8 < n-C4H10 < iso-C4H10。

催化剂再生是通过还原态VOx物种的再氧化实现的。当使用O2作为氧化剂时，这个过程可能形成过氧物种，这些物种具有高反应性，导致非选择性氧化。而使用N2O时，它直接恢复晶格氧而不形成这些活性中间体，从而提高选择性。

文献没有讨论CO2作为氧化剂的情况，也没有比较V2O5、VOx/SiO2、CeO2和过渡金属簇等不同催化剂在丙烷ODH中活化CO2的情况。它也没有提到CO2解离的提议机制或能量障碍。

总之，虽然该文档提供了使用VOx催化剂以O2和N2O作为氧化剂进行ODH机理的有价值信息，但它并未涉及问题的所有方面，特别是关于氧化还原非活性催化剂、CO2作为氧化剂以及不同类型催化剂在CO2活化方面的比较。
