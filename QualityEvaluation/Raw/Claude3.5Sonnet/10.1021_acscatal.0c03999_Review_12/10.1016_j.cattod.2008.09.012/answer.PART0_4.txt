[1] "Selectivity to olefins is significantly increased, and COx formation is suppressed, when N2O is used as oxidizing agent [712]."

[2] "Irrespective of the oxidant applied, the initial rate of alkane conversion follows the order: C2H6<C3H8<n-C4H10<iso-C4H10. It is important to highlight that the same order is also valid for the strength of the weakest CH bond in these alkanes [15,16]."

[3] "When N2O is used instead of O2, the rates of alkane conversion and alkene formation decrease by factor of 38 and 1.66,while the ratesofCOand CO2 formationbecomelower in630and 1570 times, respectively."

[4] "Alkanes react with oxidized VOx species yielding reduced ones. The reduced VOx species are reoxidized by N2O resulting in gas-phase N2 and restoring lattice oxygen species."

[5] "Recent DFT calculations of interaction of O2 and N2O with reduced and oxidized VOx species suggest that peroxo species are formed upon interaction of O2 but not N2O with reduced VOx species [26]. These bi-atomic oxygen species are further transformed to lattice oxygen ones."

The literature does not directly compare redox-active and redox-inactive metal oxide catalysts for oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of alkanes. However, it provides insights into the mechanism of ODH using VOx species, which are redox-active catalysts.

For VOx catalysts, C-H bond activation appears to be the rate-limiting step in ODH reactions. The reactivity of alkanes increases as the strength of the weakest C-H bond decreases, following the order C2H6 < C3H8 < n-C4H10 < iso-C4H10.

Catalyst regeneration occurs through reoxidation of reduced VOx species. With O2 as the oxidant, this process can form peroxo species, which are highly reactive and contribute to non-selective oxidation. When N2O is used instead, it directly restores lattice oxygen without forming these reactive intermediates, leading to improved selectivity.

The literature does not discuss CO2 as an oxidant or compare different catalysts like V2O5, VOx/SiO2, CeO2, and transition metal clusters for CO2 activation in propane ODH. It also does not mention proposed mechanisms or energy barriers for CO2 dissociation.

In summary, while the document provides valuable information on the ODH mechanism using VOx catalysts with O2 and N2O as oxidants, it does not address all aspects of the question, particularly regarding redox-inactive catalysts, CO2 as an oxidant, and comparisons between different catalyst types for CO2 activation.

该文献并未直接比较氧化脱氢(ODH)反应中氧化还原活性和非活性金属氧化物催化剂。然而，它提供了使用VOx物种（氧化还原活性催化剂）进行ODH的机理见解。

对于VOx催化剂，C-H键活化似乎是ODH反应的限速步骤。烷烃的反应活性随最弱C-H键强度的降低而增加，顺序为C2H6 < C3H8 < n-C4H10 < iso-C4H10。

催化剂再生是通过还原态VOx物种的再氧化实现的。当使用O2作为氧化剂时，这个过程可能形成过氧物种，这些物种具有高反应性，导致非选择性氧化。而使用N2O时，它直接恢复晶格氧而不形成这些活性中间体，从而提高选择性。

文献没有讨论CO2作为氧化剂的情况，也没有比较V2O5、VOx/SiO2、CeO2和过渡金属簇等不同催化剂在丙烷ODH中活化CO2的情况。它也没有提到CO2解离的提议机制或能量障碍。

总之，虽然该文档提供了使用VOx催化剂以O2和N2O作为氧化剂进行ODH机理的有价值信息，但它并未涉及问题的所有方面，特别是关于氧化还原非活性催化剂、CO2作为氧化剂以及不同类型催化剂在CO2活化方面的比较。
