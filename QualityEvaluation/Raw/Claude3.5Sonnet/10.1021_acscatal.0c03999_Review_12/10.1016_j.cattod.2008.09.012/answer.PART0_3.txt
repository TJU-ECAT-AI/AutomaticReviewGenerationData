[1] "For both oxidants, the initial rate of alkane conversion follows the order: C2H6<C3H8<n-C4H10<iso-C4H10. It is important to highlight that the same order is also valid for the strength of the weakest CH bond in these alkanes [15,16]. Considering both experimental facts, it is suggested that the breaking of the weakest CH bond limits the ODH reaction over highly dispersed VOx species independent of the oxidant applied."

[2] "Irrespective of the alkane applied, two important improving effects of N2O have been identified for the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane, propane, n-butane and iso-butane: (i) higher primary olefin selectivity, and (ii) lower decrease in olefin selectivity with increasing alkane conversion, i.e. lower ability for consecutive alkene overoxidation."

[3] "TAP results, and SSITKA data consistent with Mar-van-Krevelen mechanism, where selective, and non-selective reactions occur on lattice oxygen of VOx species. This is valid for O2- and N2O-containing feeds. O2 and C3H8 sequential pulsing in the TAP reactor and 16O2C3H8/18O2C3H8 SSITKA experiment indicate that COx formation in the presence of O2 involves additional another type of oxygen species. These oxygen species are assumed to be of molecular nature and are not formed from N2O. This may be a reason of the superior performance of N2O over O2."

The literature does not directly compare redox-active and redox-inactive metal oxide catalysts for oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of alkanes, nor does it discuss CO2 as an oxidant or the effectiveness of catalysts like CeO2 and transition metal clusters. However, it does provide some insights into the mechanisms of C-H bond activation and catalyst regeneration for VOx catalysts using O2 and N2O as oxidants.

For VOx catalysts, the breaking of the weakest C-H bond in the alkane molecule appears to be the rate-limiting step in ODH reactions, regardless of the oxidant used (O2 or N2O). This is evidenced by the correlation between alkane reactivity order and the strength of the weakest C-H bond.

The catalyst regeneration mechanism follows a Mars-van Krevelen type process, where both selective and non-selective reactions occur on lattice oxygen of VOx species. This is true for both O2 and N2O oxidants. However, O2 appears to form additional oxygen species (possibly of molecular nature) that are not formed from N2O. These additional species contribute to COx formation, explaining why N2O shows superior performance as an oxidant in terms of olefin selectivity.

N2O demonstrates two key advantages over O2 in ODH reactions: (1) higher primary olefin selectivity, and (2) lower decrease in olefin selectivity with increasing alkane conversion. This suggests that N2O is less prone to causing consecutive alkene overoxidation compared to O2.

The study does not provide information on CO2 activation or its use as an oxidant in ODH reactions. Similarly, it does not discuss other catalysts like CeO2 or transition metal clusters, focusing primarily on VOx species supported on MCM-41.

该文献并未直接比较氧化还原活性和非活性金属氧化物催化剂在烷烃氧化脱氢(ODH)中的表现，也没有讨论CO2作为氧化剂的使用，或者CeO2和过渡金属簇等催化剂的效果。然而，它确实提供了一些关于VOx催化剂使用O2和N2O作为氧化剂时C-H键活化和催化剂再生机制的见解。

对于VOx催化剂，无论使用何种氧化剂（O2或N2O），烷烃分子中最弱C-H键的断裂似乎是ODH反应的限速步骤。这一点从烷烃反应活性顺序与最弱C-H键强度的相关性中得到证实。

催化剂再生机制遵循Mars-van Krevelen类型过程，其中选择性和非选择性反应都发生在VOx物种的晶格氧上。这对O2和N2O氧化剂都适用。然而，O2似乎形成了额外的氧物种（可能是分子性质的），这些物种不是由N2O形成的。这些额外的物种导致COx的形成，解释了为什么N2O作为氧化剂在烯烃选择性方面表现更优。

N2O在ODH反应中显示出两个关键优势：(1)更高的初级烯烃选择性，(2)随着烷烃转化率增加，烯烃选择性降低的程度较小。这表明与O2相比，N2O不太容易导致连续的烯烃过度氧化。

该研究没有提供关于CO2活化或其作为ODH反应中氧化剂使用的信息。同样，它也没有讨论其他催化剂如CeO2或过渡金属簇，主要集中在支持在MCM-41上的VOx物种。
