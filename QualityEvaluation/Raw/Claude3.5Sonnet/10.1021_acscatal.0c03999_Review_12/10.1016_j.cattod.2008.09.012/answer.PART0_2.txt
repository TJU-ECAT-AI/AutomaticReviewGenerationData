[1] "Selectivity to olefins is significantly increased, and COx formation is suppressed, when N2O is used as oxidizing agent [712]."

[2] "For both oxidants, the initial rate of alkane conversion follows the order: C2H6<C3H8<n-C4H10<iso-C4H10. It is important to highlight that the same order is also valid for the strength of the weakest CH bond in these alkanes [15,16]."

[3] "When N2O is used instead of O2, the rates of alkane conversion and alkene formation decrease by factor of 38 and 1.66,while the ratesofCOand CO2 formationbecomelower in630and 1570 times, respectively."

[4] "Irrespective of the oxidant applied, olefin selectivity decreases with an increase in the alkane conversion, while COx selectivity increases"

[5] "Alkanes react with oxidized VOx species yielding reduced ones. The reduced VOx species are reoxidized by N2O resulting in gas-phase N2 and restoring lattice oxygen species."

[6] "Recent DFT calculations of interaction of O2 and N2O with reduced and oxidized VOx species suggest that peroxo species are formed upon interaction of O2 but not N2O with reduced VOx species [26]. These bi-atomic oxygen species are further transformed to lattice oxygen ones."

The literature does not directly compare redox-active and redox-inactive metal oxide catalysts for oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of alkanes. It primarily focuses on VOx/MCM-41 catalysts using O2 and N2O as oxidants. However, some insights can be drawn from the provided information:

For VOx catalysts (redox-active):

1. C-H bond activation: The rate of alkane conversion correlates with the strength of the weakest C-H bond, suggesting that breaking this bond is the rate-limiting step in ODH reactions.

2. Catalyst regeneration: Reduced VOx species are reoxidized by the oxidant (O2 or N2O), restoring lattice oxygen. N2O decomposition is more efficient on reduced VOx species.

3. Oxidant comparison: N2O leads to higher olefin selectivity and lower COx formation compared to O2. This is attributed to N2O's inability to form peroxo species, which are thought to be responsible for non-selective oxidation.

The literature does not discuss CO2 as an oxidant or compare different catalyst types (V2O5, VOx/SiO2, CeO2, transition metal clusters) for CO2 activation in propane ODH. It also doesn't provide information on energy barriers for CO2 dissociation.

In general, the mechanism involves alkane activation by lattice oxygen, followed by catalyst reoxidation. The choice of oxidant significantly impacts selectivity, with N2O offering superior performance due to its inability to form highly reactive oxygen species that lead to overoxidation.

该文献并未直接比较氧化还原活性和非活性金属氧化物催化剂在烷烃氧化脱氢(ODH)中的表现。它主要集中于使用O2和N2O作为氧化剂的VOx/MCM-41催化剂。然而，从所提供的信息中可以得出一些见解：

对于VOx催化剂（氧化还原活性）：

1. C-H键活化：烷烃转化率与最弱C-H键强度相关，表明在ODH反应中断裂该键是限速步骤。

2. 催化剂再生：还原态VOx物种被氧化剂（O2或N2O）重新氧化，恢复晶格氧。N2O在还原态VOx物种上的分解更有效。

3. 氧化剂比较：与O2相比，N2O导致更高的烯烃选择性和更低的COx生成。这归因于N2O无法形成过氧物种，而过氧物种被认为是非选择性氧化的原因。

该文献未讨论CO2作为氧化剂，也未比较不同类型催化剂（V2O5、VOx/SiO2、CeO2、过渡金属簇）在丙烷ODH中活化CO2的情况。它也没有提供CO2解离的能量障碍信息。

总的来说，机理涉及烷烃被晶格氧活化，随后催化剂被重新氧化。氧化剂的选择显著影响选择性，N2O由于无法形成导致过度氧化的高活性氧物种，因此表现出更优异的性能。
