[1] "Irrespective of the alkane and the oxidant applied, the overall rate of alkane conversion increases with a decrease in the strength of the weakest CH bond in the alkane molecule indicating that alkane activation is the rate-limiting step."

[2] "Upon replacing O2 with N2O, the overall activity decreases but the olefin selectivity increases. The selectivity increase is due to suppressing non-selective production of CO and CO2 via direct alkane combustion and consecutive alkene oxidation."

[3] "Transient experiments in the TAP reactor and in a SSITKA set up evidenced, that N2O does not decompose over oxidized VOx species in the absence of alkane, while heterogenenous oxygen isotopic exchange between gas-phase 18O2 and lattice 16O of VOx species takes place yielding 18O16O."

[4] "Both, the decomposition of N2O and the oxygen isotopic exchange are significantly accelerated in the presence of alkanes indicating that reduced VOx species are more reactive for these processes than the oxidized ones."

[5] "TAP results, and SSITKA data consistent with Mar-van-Krevelen mechanism, where selective, and non-selective reactions occur on lattice oxygen of VOx species. This is valid for O2- and N2O-containing feeds."

[6] "O2 and C3H8 sequential pulsing in the TAP reactor and 16O2C3H8/18O2C3H8 SSITKA experiment indicate that COx formation in the presence of O2 involves additional another type of oxygen species. These oxygen species are assumed to be of molecular nature and are not formed from N2O. This may be a reason of the superior performance of N2O over O2."

The literature does not directly compare redox-active and redox-inactive metal oxide catalysts or discuss CO2 as an oxidant for oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of alkanes. However, we can extract some information about the mechanisms of C-H bond activation and catalyst regeneration for VOx catalysts using O2 and N2O as oxidants:

1. C-H bond activation: The rate-limiting step in ODH is the activation of the weakest C-H bond in the alkane molecule. This step occurs on the catalyst surface and is independent of the oxidant used.

2. Catalyst regeneration: The regeneration mechanism differs between O2 and N2O:
   - With O2: Oxygen isotopic exchange experiments show that O2 dissociatively adsorbs on oxidized VOx species, forming lattice oxygen. This process is reversible.
   - With N2O: N2O does not decompose on oxidized VOx species in the absence of alkanes. However, reduced VOx species (formed after C-H activation) can decompose N2O, regenerating the catalyst.

3. Reaction mechanism: Both O2 and N2O follow a Mars-van Krevelen mechanism, where lattice oxygen participates in selective and non-selective reactions.

4. Selectivity differences: N2O shows superior performance compared to O2 in terms of olefin selectivity. This is attributed to the suppression of non-selective CO and CO2 formation. With O2, additional oxygen species (possibly molecular in nature) are formed, which contribute to non-selective oxidation. These species are not formed with N2O, explaining its higher selectivity.

5. Catalyst state effects: Reduced VOx species are more reactive than oxidized ones for both N2O decomposition and oxygen isotopic exchange.

The literature does not provide information on CO2 activation or its use as an oxidant for ODH of propane, nor does it discuss other catalysts like CeO2 or transition metal clusters in this context.

该文献并未直接比较氧化还原活性和非氧化还原活性的金属氧化物催化剂，也没有讨论CO2作为烷烃氧化脱氢(ODH)的氧化剂。但是，我们可以提取一些关于使用O2和N2O作为氧化剂的VOx催化剂的C-H键活化和催化剂再生机理的信息：

1. C-H键活化：ODH的限速步骤是烷烃分子中最弱C-H键的活化。这一步骤发生在催化剂表面，与所使用的氧化剂无关。

2. 催化剂再生：O2和N2O的再生机理不同：
   - 对于O2：氧同位素交换实验表明，O2在氧化的VOx物种上解离吸附，形成晶格氧。这个过程是可逆的。
   - 对于N2O：在没有烷烃的情况下，N2O不会在氧化的VOx物种上分解。但是，还原的VOx物种（在C-H活化后形成）可以分解N2O，从而再生催化剂。

3. 反应机理：O2和N2O都遵循Mars-van Krevelen机理，其中晶格氧参与选择性和非选择性反应。

4. 选择性差异：与O2相比，N2O在烯烃选择性方面表现更优。这归因于抑制了非选择性CO和CO2的形成。使用O2时，会形成额外的氧物种（可能是分子性质的），这些物种会导致非选择性氧化。使用N2O时不会形成这些物种，这解释了其更高的选择性。

5. 催化剂状态效应：对于N2O分解和氧同位素交换，还原态的VOx物种比氧化态的更具反应活性。

该文献没有提供关于CO2活化或将其用作丙烷ODH氧化剂的信息，也没有在这方面讨论其他催化剂如CeO2或过渡金属簇。
