Similarity and differences in the oxidative dehydrogenation of C2C4 alkanes
over nano-sized VOx species using N2O and O2

1. Introduction
Oxidative conversion of light alkanes to respective olefins and
oxygenates is still a challenging approach in modern oxidation
catalysis not only from a fundamental but also from an applied
point of view [16]. The main challenge is to minimize the
formation of carbon oxides (COx) in favor of selective products.
Selectivity to olefins is significantly increased, and COx formation is
suppressed, when N2O is used as oxidizing agent [712]. Under-
standing the origins of the superior performance of N2O as
compared to O2 may help to identify selective and non-selective
pathways/oxygen species. This knowledge is of high scientific and
industrial interest to design catalytic materials or catalytic
processes performing selectively with O2, too.
The present contribution was aimed to elucidate the effect of O2
and N2O on catalytic performance of highly dispersed surface VOx
species supported over MCM-41 in the oxidative dehydrogenation
(ODH) of ethane, propane, n-butane, and iso-butane. To this end,
steady-state catalytic tests at different contact times were
combined with transient isotopic experiments in vacuum and at
ambient pressure using the TAP (temporal analysis of products)
and
SSITKA
(steady-state transient
kinetic
analysis)
reactor
systems, respectively. The catalyst has been previously well
characterized [10] by various physico-chemical methods (BET,
EPR, XRD, in situ UV/vis-DRS and Raman spectroscopies as well as
H2-TPR). VOx species over MCM-41 with vanadium loading up to
5.3 wt.% has been classified as mainly monomer and small two-
dimensional VOx aggregates.
2. Experimental
2.1. Preparation of catalytic materials
VOx/MCM-41 was prepared by impregnation of MCM-41 with a
predetermined
amount
of
vanadium
acetyl
acetate
([CH3COCH
C(O)CH3]2VO) in toluene. The resulting catalyst
precursor was calcined at 823 K for 12 h in air. Details of catalyst
preparation and characterization have been reported previously
[10]. In the present study, a sample with V loading of 5.3 wt.%,
designated as VOx(5)/MCM-41, was used.
2.2. Steady-state catalytic testing
Catalytic measurements were carried out in a U-type fixed-bed
reactor made of quartz (i.d. = 6 mm) at T = 773 K and ambient
pressure. The catalyst particle size was between 255 and 350 mm.

The effect of O2 and N2O on alkane reactivity and olefin selectivity in the oxidative dehydrogenation of
ethane, propane, n-butane, and iso-butane over highly dispersed VOx species (0.79 V/nm2) supported on
MCM-41 has been systematically investigated. For all the reactions studied, olefin selectivity was
significantly improved upon replacing O2 with N2O. This is due to suppressing COx formation in the
presence of N2O. The most significant improving effect of N2O was observed for iso-butane
dehydrogenation: S(iso-butene) was ca. 67% at X(iso-butane) of 25%.
Possible origins of the superior performance of N2O were derived from transient experiments using
18O2 traces. 18O16O species were detected in 18O2 and 18O2C3H8 transient experiments indicating
reversible oxygen chemisorption. In the presence of alkanes, the isotopic heteroexchange of O2 strongly
increased. Based on the distribution of labeled oxygen in COx and in O2 as well as on the increased COx
formation in sequential O2C3H8 experiments, it is suggested that non-lattice oxygen species (possibly of
a bi-atomic nature) originating from O2 are non-selective ones and responsible for COx formation. These
species are not formed from N2O.

The following reaction feeds were used: CnH2n+2:O2:Ne = 40:20:40
and CnH2n+2:N2O:Ne = 40:40:20, where CnH2n+2 were ethane,
propane, n-butane and iso-butane. Ne was used as internal
standard for gas chromatographic product analysis (HP-5890
equipped with Poraplot Q and Molsiev 5 columns).
2.3. Transient catalytic experiments
The TAP-2 reactor system has been comprehensively described
elsewhere [13]. The catalyst (ca. 20 mg, sieve fraction 250
350 mm) was packed in the micro-reactor made of quartz (40 mm
length and 6 mm i.d.) between two layers of quartz of the same
particle size. The catalyst was treated in a flow of O2 (30 ml/min) at
773 K and ambient pressure for ca. 1 h before each experiment.
Then, the micro-reactor was evacuated at 773 K to 105 Pa. Two
types of transient experiments were carried out using a pulse size
of ca. 1015 molecules:
 Single pulsing of C3H8:Ne = 1:1 or 18O2:Ne = 1:1 over V16Ox/
MCM-41.
 16O2:Xe = 1:1 and C3H8:Ne = 1:1 reaction mixtures were sequen-
tially pulsed over V16Ox/MCM-41 from two pulse valves with a
time delay of 0.1 s.
Under conditions applied, gas-phase interactions are strongly
minimized. Therefore, only heterogeneous reaction steps were
under investigation. In the experiments, Ne (99.995%), Xe (99.99%),
O2 (99.995%), and C3H8 (99.95%) were used. The 18O2 oxygen
isotope was purchased from ISOTEC. Transient responses were
monitored using a quadruple mass spectrometer (HAL RC 301
Hiden Analytical). For more detailed description see [12].
Steady-state isotopic transient kinetic analysis (SSITKA) experi-
ments were performed in a tubular quartz reactor at 773 K and
ambient pressure. Catalyst amount and gas flows were fixed to
80 mg and 30 ml/min (STP), respectively. The following reaction
feeds
were
used:
16O2:Ar = 2:98,
18O2:Ne:Ar = 2:2:96,
C3H8:16O2:Ar = 4:2:94 and C3H8:18O2:Ne:Ar = 4:2:2:92. Oxygen
tracing experiments were performed by switching from non-
labeled to labeled reaction feeds after a steady-state operation was
achieved with the non-labeled feed. The gas composition at the
reactor outlet was monitored by on-line mass spectrometry
(Balzer Omnistar). For more experimental details see [14].
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Steady-state performance of oxidative dehydrogenation with O2
and N2O
Corresponding olefins, CO and CO2 were the main carbon-
containing products in the oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of
ethane, propane, n-butane and iso-butane over VOx(5)/MCM-41 at
773 K using O2 and N2O. Another minor products were acetalde-
hyde, acrolein, ethane, and propane. However, the overall selectivity
to these products was not higher as 10% under reaction conditions
applied and alkane conversion below 15%. In order to compare the
reactivity of highly dispersed VOx species for alkane oxidation with
O2 and N2O, the initial rates of alkane conversion as well as the rates
of formation of olefins, CO and CO2 were determined at low degrees
of
alkane
and
oxidant
conversion
(X(CnH2n+2) < 5%,
X(O2/
N2O) < 10%). These rates are summarized in Table 1. Since the
amount of oxygen atoms in O2- and N2O-containing feeds was the
same, the activity and selectivity of these oxidants in the ODH
reactions can be correctly compared. For both oxidants, the initial
rate of alkane conversion follows the order: C2H6<C3H8<n-
C4H10<iso-C4H10. It is important to highlight that the same order
is also valid for the strength of the weakest CH bond in these
alkanes [15,16]. Considering both experimental facts, it is suggested
that the breaking of the weakest CH bond limits the ODH reaction
over highly dispersed VOx species independent of the oxidant
applied. However, the oxidant influences strongly the activity and
the selectivity. When N2O is used instead of O2, the rates of alkane
conversion and alkene formation decrease by factor of 38 and 1.6
6,while the ratesofCOand CO2 formationbecomelower in630and
1570 times, respectively. Such a dramatic decrease in the COx
production clearly distinguishes the low ability of N2O for non-
selective alkane/alkene conversion in favor of the selective olefin
production.
In order to further elucidate the role of oxidizing agent, ODH
catalytic tests were performed at different degrees of alkane
conversion. The results obtained are presented in Fig. 1. Irrespec-
tive of the oxidant applied, olefin selectivity decreases with an
increase in the alkane conversion, while COx selectivity increases
(data are not shown for brevity). For an O2-containig feed, primary
(extrapolated to zero alkane conversion) alkene selectivity in the
ODH of propane, n-butane, and iso-butane is close to ca. 7080%,
while it is only ca. 30% for the ethane ODH. This indicates that
direct ethane oxidation to COx strongly contributes to the overall
COx production as compared to the ODH of other alkanes. Upon
replacing O2 with N2O, olefin selectivity significantly increases
(Fig. 1(b)), while COx selectivity decreases. The highest effect of
N2O on olefin selectivity was found for the ODH of iso-C4H10.
Primary iso-C4H8 selectivity with O2 is ca. 7075%, but falls to 10%
with an increase in the conversion of iso-C4H10 up to 10%, while
COx selectivity strongly increases. Such a low ODH performance
agrees well with the literature data reporting maximal yield of iso-
C4H8 of 611% [1721]. The overall CO and CO2 selectivity was
lower than 7% at X(iso-C4H10) of 25%, when N2O was used as
oxidant. The selectivity towards iso-C4H8 amounted to 65%
resulting in a yield of 16%.
Irrespective of the alkane applied, two important improving
effects of N2O have been identified for the oxidative dehydrogena-
tion of ethane, propane, n-butane and iso-butane: (i) higher
primary olefin selectivity, and (ii) lower decrease in olefin
selectivity with increasing alkane conversion, i.e. lower ability
for
consecutive
alkene
overoxidation.
These
results
are
in
agreement with our previous studies of the oxidative dehydro-
genation of propane [10]. For deriving deeper insights into primary
and secondary reaction pathways of the ODH reaction with O2 and
N2O over VOx(5)/MCM-41, transient experiments were carried out
in the TAP and SSITKA reactor systems using 18O2 traces. Particular
attention was paid to COx formation and, hence, to the factors

determining the olefin selectivity loss. The results are presented
below.
3.2. Mechanistic analysis of the ODH reaction with O2 and N2O
3.2.1. Interaction of O2 and N2O with oxidized and reduced VOx species
Fig. 2(a) illustrates height-normalized transient responses of
18O2, 18O16O and 16O2 upon pulsing 18O2 in the TAP reactor over
oxidized V16Ox/MCM-41. The normalization was done for better
comparing the shape and the order of appearance of gas-phase
components. The transient of 18O2 appears after the shortest time
interval followed by those of 18O16O and 16O2. The appearance of
18O16O before
16O2 in the gas-phase indicates simple hetero-
exchange mechanism with participation of one lattice oxygen of
VOx species [22]. The formation of 18O16O due to homoexchange,
i.e. 18O2(gas) + 16O2(gas) $ 18O16O(gas) [23], can be excluded because
16O2 and 18O2 were not pulsed together. The presence of 18O16O
indicates reversible oxygen adsorption over VOx species. We would
like to emphasize that no gas-phase 18O16O was detected under
similar conditions in our previous work over VOx/g-Al2O3 in the
TAP-reactor [24] and in the literature over VOx/ZrO2 [25]. This can
be explained by faster incorporation of gas-phase oxygen into VOx
species over VOx/g-Al2O3 and VOx/ZrO2 as compared to VOx(5)/
MCM-41.
The presence of
18O16O over VOx(5)/MCM-41 was also
observed at ambient pressure during SSITKA experiments. The
transients
of
oxygen
isotopes
upon
switching
from
16O2:Ar = 2:98 to 18O2:Ar:Ne = 2:96:2 are shown in Fig. 2(b) as
black lines. The concentration of non-labeled oxygen (16O2)
decreases, while the concentration of labeled oxygen (18O2)
increases. The 18O16O transient passes over a maximum at ca.
2 min after switching. The presence of
18O16O proves that
oxidized V16Ox species are active for oxygen isotopic exchange.
This means that the double bond in the O2 molecule is broken
and restored, i.e., lattice oxygen of VOx species is able to activate
gas-phase O2. However, the distribution of oxygen isotopic labels
changes, when propane and oxygen are fed together (Fig. 2(b)
grey lines). A significantly higher ratio of
18O16O/18O2 was
detected in the presence of propane. This means that isotopic
scrambling is enhanced when propane is present. This difference
can be explained by higher concentration of reduced VOx sites in
presence of propane, over which gas-phase oxygen is initially
activated
and
further
participates
in
the
oxygen
isotopic
exchange and in the ODH reaction.

In order to prove whether oxidized VOx species are active for
direct N2O decomposition, this reaction was studied at 773 K by
feeding an N2O-containing mixture (N2O:Ne = 40:60) over the
catalyst. Only traces of N2 but no O2 were detected at the reactor
outlet. This means that oxidized VOx species do not decompose
N2O (reduced VOx species, which can be formed at 773 K in an O2-
free atmosphere, participate in N2O decomposition without O2
formation). We repeated the above experiment, however, in the
presence of alkanes. N2O conversion strongly increases when N2O
and alkane were fed together to the reactor (Table 2). It should be
especially emphasized that no gas-phase O2 was also observed in
the experiments with alkaneN2O mixtures at various conversions
of alkane and N2O. This result can be explained as follows. Alkanes
react with oxidized VOx species yielding reduced ones. The reduced
VOx species are reoxidized by N2O resulting in gas-phase N2 and
restoring lattice oxygen species. The high activity of reduced VOx
species for N2O decomposition agrees well with recent DFT
calculations of interaction of N2O with oxidized and reduced
isolated and dimeric VOx species over SiO2 [26]. Thus, oxidized VOx
species are able to activate O2 but not N2O. In the presence of
propane, oxidized VOx species are transformed to the reduced
ones,
which
are
highly
active
for
O2
activation
and
N2O
decomposition.
3.2.2. Products of propane reactions with VOx species in the absence
and presence of gas-phase O2
The interaction of C3H8 with VOx(5)/MCM-41 was studied at
773 K by means of single C3H8 as well as sequential O2 and C3H8
pulse experiments in the TAP-reactor. In these both experiments,
the degree of C3H8 conversion did not exceed 2%. In the oxygen-
free experiments, C3H6 was the only carbon-containing reaction
product. Since gas-phase O2 was not present in the C3H8 pulse, it is
concluded that C3H6 is formed by C3H8 oxidation with lattice
oxygen of VOx species. Low amounts of CO and CO2 could not be
unambiguously identified due to overlapping mass spectra of C3H8,
CO2, and CO. However, CO2 was observed, when O2 and C3H8 were
sequentially pulsed with a time delay of 0.1 s between the O2 and
C3H8 pulses (Fig. 3(a)). A definitive detection of CO was not
possible. This result implies that CO2 formation is accelerated in
the presence of gas-phase O2. Either this could be due to higher
oxidation degree of VOx species when compared to single C3H8
pulse experiments in the absence of O2 or due to the presence of
other surface oxygen species, which are formed from gas-phase O2.
Mechanistic insights into the participation of oxygen from VOx
species and from gas-phase O2 in CO2 formation were derived from
the analysis of temporal profiles of C16O2, C18O16O, and C18O2
formed over V16Ox(5)/MCM-41 at 773 K upon switching from a
C3H8:16O2:Ar = 4:2:94 mixture to a C3H8:18O2:Ar:Ne = 4:2:92:2
mixture in the SSITKA set-up at ambient pressure (Fig. 3(b)). Since
non-labeled oxygen (16O2) was not present in the latter feed but
C16O2 and C18O16O were observed as reaction products, it is
concluded that lattice oxygen of VOx species participates in carbon
dioxide formation.
The question here is whether all oxygen species responsible for
the formation of CO2 are chemically equivalent. To this end, we
analyze time-on-stream distribution of differently labeled carbon
dioxides in Fig. 3(b). The C16O2 transient response approaches zero
after ca. 20 min on stream in the C3H8:18O2:Ar:Ne = 4:2:92:2
mixture.
C18O16O
and
C18O2,
which
contain
oxygen
atoms
from gas-phase
18O2, start to be formed immediately after
switching
from
a
C3H8:16O2:Ar = 4:2:94
mixture
to
a
C3H8:18O2:Ar:Ne = 4:2:92:2 mixture. However, their transients
differ strongly in the shape. The intensity of C18O16O transient
increases strongly with time approaching a maximum after ca.
5 min on stream in the C3H8:18O2:Ar:Ne = 4:2:92:2 flow followed
by a slow decay, while the intensity of the C18O2 transient
increases slower, but continuously. The permanent increase of
C18O2 production is attributed to slow replacing of non-labeled
(16O) lattice oxygen in VOx species by labeled (18O) ones
originating from gas-phase 18O2. Another important observation
is the difference in the temporal profiles of C16O2 and C16O18O in
Fig. 3 (b). These two isotopically labeled carbon dioxides contain
16O, which originates from the lattice oxygen of VOx species. While
the concentration of C16O2 drops to zero within first 20 min on
stream in the C3H8:18O2:Ar:Ne = 4:2:92:2 flow, the concentration
of C16O18O is much higher and similar to C18O2. Let us compare the

above experimental results with a statistical distribution of
isotopically labeled oxygen in CO2 assuming all active surface
oxygen species are chemically equivalent. If we express the
fraction of 18O in lattice oxygen as y, the fraction of 16O is (1  y).
The probability to find two 18O and two 16O atoms in VOx species is
equal to y2 and (1  y)2, respectively. The probability to find one
18O and one
16O is 2y(1  y). From experimentally obtained
fraction of C16O2, y can be calculated without any assumption
about the kinetics of isotopic exchange. The calculated fractions of
differently labeled carbon dioxides are presented in Fig. 3(b) as
dotted lines. It has to be repeated that these isotopic distribution
should be observed if all the surface oxygen species would be
chemically equivalent. It is obvious that the statistical model does
not correctly describe the experiment. Therefore, it is suggested
that surface oxygen species participating in the formation of CO2
are not chemically equivalent. However, no definitive conclusion
on the nature of these oxygen species could be derived from our
experiments. Recent DFT calculations of interaction of O2 and N2O
with reduced and oxidized VOx species suggest that peroxo species
are formed upon interaction of O2 but not N2O with reduced VOx
species [26]. These bi-atomic oxygen species are further trans-
formed to lattice oxygen ones. The latter species are also formed
upon reoxidation of reduced VOx species by N2O. Our transient
results in Section 3.2 in agreement with literature demonstrate
that lattice oxygen participates in both selective alkane dehy-
drogenation and non-selective COx formation. According to the
DFT calculations in [26], peroxovanadates, which are formed from
O2 only, are highly reactive for consecutive propene oxidation to
COx. At this stage, it is important to stress that the slope of the ODH
selectivity-conversion relationships in Fig. 1 depends on the
oxidant applied. This slope reflects the catalyst ability for
consecutive combustion of primarily formed olefins to COx. Upon
replacing O2 with N2O, olefin selectivity in the ODH decreases
slower with an increase in alkane conversion indicating lower
ability of N2O for consecutive olefin oxidation. This experimental
result nicely correlates with the theoretical predictions. It is also
important to mention the following order of consecutive olefin
oxidation with O2: C2H4  C3H6 < n-C4H8  iso-C4H8. This order is
also valid for the stability of ions or radicals formed from the
respective alkanes by abstraction of one hydrogen atom. Based on
these experimental facts it can be suggested that the long-living
ions/radicals are easily oxidized to COx.
Based on the above experimental results and DFT calculation in
[26], the improving effect of N2O on the ODH selectivity over highly
dispersed VOx species supported over MCM-41 can be due to the
inability
of
N2O
to
generate
non-selective
oxygen
species
originating upon reoxidation of reduced VOx species by O2.
However, there is a need for direct experimental evidences. Our
experimental effort to unravel the nature of these oxygen species is
now in progress.
4. Summary
The oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane, propane, n-butane
and iso-butane to respective olefins with O2 and N2O was
investigated over highly dispersed VOx species supported over
MCM-41. Irrespective of the alkane and the oxidant applied, the
overall rate of alkane conversion increases with a decrease in the
strength of the weakest CH bond in the alkane molecule
indicating that alkane activation is the rate-limiting step. Upon
replacing O2 with N2O, the overall activity decreases but the olefin
selectivity increases. The selectivity increase is due to suppressing
non-selective
production of CO
and
CO2 via
direct alkane
combustion and consecutive alkene oxidation.
Transient experiments in the TAP reactor and in a SSITKA set up
evidenced, that N2O does not decompose over oxidized VOx species
in the absence of alkane, while heterogenenous oxygen isotopic
exchange between gas-phase 18O2 and lattice 16O of VOx species
takes place yielding 18O16O. The presence of mixed oxygen isotope
proves reversible dissociative O2 adsorption over oxidized VOx
species. Both, the decomposition of N2O and the oxygen isotopic
exchange are significantly accelerated in the presence of alkanes
indicating that reduced VOx species are more reactive for these
processes than the oxidized ones.
TAP results, and SSITKA data consistent with Mar-van-
Krevelen mechanism, where selective, and non-selective reac-
tions occur on lattice oxygen of VOx species. This is valid for O2-
and N2O-containing feeds. O2 and C3H8 sequential pulsing in the
TAP
reactor
and
16O2C3H8/18O2C3H8
SSITKA
experiment
indicate that COx formation in the presence of O2 involves
additional another type of oxygen species. These oxygen species
are assumed to be of molecular nature and are not formed from
N2O. This may be a reason of the superior performance of N2O
over O2.

<questions>


Compare and contrast the mechanisms of C-H bond activation and catalyst regeneration in oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes for redox-active and redox-inactive metal oxide catalysts, explaining the role of traditional oxidants and CO2. Include a discussion on the effectiveness of different catalysts (such as V2O5, VOx/SiO2, CeO2, and transition metal clusters) in activating CO2 for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane, considering the proposed mechanisms and energy barriers for CO2 dissociation.

First, you need to sequentially extract any quotes in the literature that are most relevant to each question, and print them in numbered order, separated by newlines. Quotes should be relatively brief. Do not attempt to summarize or answer questions at this stage, but simply repeat exactly what the corresponding part of the literature says.

Please enclose the full list of quotes in <quotes></quotes> XML tags. If there are no relevant quotes, write "No relevant quotes" instead.

Then, answer the question, starting with "Answer:".  Do not include or reference quoted content verbatim in the answer. Don't say "According to Quote [1]" when answering. Do not write reference number of quotes after answer. Put your answer to the user inside <EnglishVersionAnswer></EnglishVersionAnswer> XML tags. Output formatted text, with line breaks for each question.Separate quotes and answers with a blank line. Provide the answers to all questions in English. After completing the English answers, translate all those answers into Chinese and provide the Chinese version inside <ChineseVersionAnswer></ChineseVersionAnswer> XML tags.

Thus, the format of your overall response should look like what's shown between the <example></example> tags.  Make sure to follow the formatting and spacing exactly.
