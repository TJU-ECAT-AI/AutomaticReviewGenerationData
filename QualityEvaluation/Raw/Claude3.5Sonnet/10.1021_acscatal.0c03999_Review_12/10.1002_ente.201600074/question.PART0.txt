I'm going to give you a scientific literature. Then I'm going to ask you some questions about it. I'd like you to first write down exact quotes of parts of the document word by word that would help answer the question, and then I'd like you to answer the question using facts from the quoted content. Do not omit any relevant information from the text, and avoid introducing any falsehoods or assumptions that aren't directly supported by the literature. Here is the literature, in <literature></literature> XML tags:

Abstract
The current study investigates a chemical-looping-based oxidative dehydrogenation (CL-ODH) concept for ethane-to-ethylene conversion. In this cyclic redox scheme, an oxide-based redox catalyst is used to selectively combust hydrogen from ethane dehydrogenation. As the hydrogen product limits ethane conversion, insitu oxidation of hydrogen enhances the ethane conversion and ethylene yield. Moreover, heat required in ODH is compensated by re-oxidation of the oxygen-deprived redox catalyst, enabling auto-thermal operation for the overall process. Compared to steam cracking, CL-ODH can potentially achieve higher efficiency with lower CO2 and NOx emissions. Silica and magnesia-supported manganese oxides are investigated. It is determined that unpromoted Mn/SiO2 and Mn/MgO redox catalysts exhibit low selectivity towards ethylene. The addition of promoters such as sodium and tungsten renders effective redox catalysts with satisfactory activity, selectivity, oxygen carrying capacity, and redox stability.

Here are the question lists, in <questions></questions>XML tags:
<questions>


Compare and contrast the mechanisms of C-H bond activation and catalyst regeneration in oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes for redox-active and redox-inactive metal oxide catalysts, explaining the role of traditional oxidants and CO2. Include a discussion on the effectiveness of different catalysts (such as V2O5, VOx/SiO2, CeO2, and transition metal clusters) in activating CO2 for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane, considering the proposed mechanisms and energy barriers for CO2 dissociation.


</questions>

First, you need to sequentially extract any quotes in the literature that are most relevant to each question, and print them in numbered order, separated by newlines. Quotes should be relatively brief. Do not attempt to summarize or answer questions at this stage, but simply repeat exactly what the corresponding part of the literature says.

Please enclose the full list of quotes in <quotes></quotes> XML tags. If there are no relevant quotes, write "No relevant quotes" instead.

Then, answer the question, starting with "Answer:".  Do not include or reference quoted content verbatim in the answer. Don't say "According to Quote [1]" when answering. Do not write reference number of quotes after answer. Put your answer to the user inside <EnglishVersionAnswer></EnglishVersionAnswer> XML tags. Output formatted text, with line breaks for each question.Separate quotes and answers with a blank line. Provide the answers to all questions in English. After completing the English answers, translate all those answers into Chinese and provide the Chinese version inside <ChineseVersionAnswer></ChineseVersionAnswer> XML tags.

Thus, the format of your overall response should look like what's shown between the <example></example> tags.  Make sure to follow the formatting and spacing exactly.
