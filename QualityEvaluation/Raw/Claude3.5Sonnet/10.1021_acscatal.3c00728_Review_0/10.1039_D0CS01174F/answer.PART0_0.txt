[1] "In 2019 the ever-growing worldwide consumption of ethylene and propylene soared to approximately 160 and 115 million tons, respectively (Fig. 1a)."

[2] "Currently about 10% of the global propylene is produced via propane dehydrogenation (PDH), which is considered an economically and environmentally friendly route. Hence, PDH is expected to be applied more widely in the forthcoming years according to a forecast that catalytic dehydrogenation of propane would supply approximately 30% of the global propylene production by the year 2025"

[3] "Since direct dehydrogenation is endothermic in nature, substantial energy input and high temperature is required to achieve acceptable conversion and high yield of target olefins, limiting its overall energy efficiency."

[4] "Oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of alkanes to olefins, featured by its intrinsic exothermicity and being free of coke, is a promising alternative to direct dehydrogenation."

Propene's significance in the chemical industry has grown substantially, with worldwide consumption reaching 115 million tons in 2019. This increasing demand is driving the adoption of propane dehydrogenation (PDH) as a preferred production method. Currently, PDH accounts for about 10% of global propylene production, but it is expected to grow to approximately 30% by 2025.

The economic and environmental advantages of PDH in meeting the growing needs for propene include:

1. It is considered an economically and environmentally friendly route compared to traditional methods.

2. It allows for the utilization of abundant propane from natural gas and shale gas resources.

3. It offers a more direct and efficient route to propene production compared to traditional petroleum-based methods.

However, direct dehydrogenation has some limitations, such as high energy requirements due to its endothermic nature. This has led to interest in oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) as a promising alternative, which is exothermic and free of coke formation. ODH potentially offers further economic and environmental benefits by reducing energy consumption and avoiding catalyst deactivation issues associated with direct dehydrogenation.

丙烯在化学工业中的重要性大幅增长，2019年全球消费量达到1.15亿吨。这种不断增长的需求推动了丙烷脱氢(PDH)作为首选生产方法的采用。目前，PDH约占全球丙烯产量的10%，但预计到2025年将增长到约30%。

PDH在满足丙烯不断增长需求方面的经济和环境优势包括：

1. 与传统方法相比，它被认为是一种经济和环保的路线。

2. 它允许利用来自天然气和页岩气资源的丰富丙烷。

3. 与传统的基于石油的方法相比，它提供了一种更直接和高效的丙烯生产路线。

然而，直接脱氢也有一些局限性，如由于其吸热性质而需要高能耗。这导致了对氧化脱氢(ODH)作为有前景的替代方案的兴趣，ODH是放热的并且没有焦炭形成。ODH可能通过减少能源消耗和避免与直接脱氢相关的催化剂失活问题，提供进一步的经济和环境效益。
