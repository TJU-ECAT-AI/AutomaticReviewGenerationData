[1] "In 2019 the ever-growing worldwide consumption of ethylene and propylene soared to approximately 160 and 115 million tons, respectively (Fig. 1a)."

[2] "Currently about 10% of the global propylene is produced via propane dehydrogenation (PDH), which is considered an economically and environmentally friendly route."

[3] "Hence, PDH is expected to be applied more widely in the forthcoming years according to a forecast that catalytic dehydrogenation of propane would supply approximately 30% of the global propylene production by the year 2025"

[4] "These technologies in general feature high energy consumption and enormous carbon emission, and contradict sustainable development criteria that have strict requirements on environmental protection and energy-consumption."

Propene's significance in the chemical industry has grown substantially, with worldwide consumption reaching 115 million tons in 2019. This increasing demand is driving greater adoption of propane dehydrogenation (PDH) as a production method. Currently, PDH accounts for about 10% of global propylene production, but this is expected to increase to approximately 30% by 2025.

The shift towards PDH offers both economic and environmental advantages. It is considered an economically viable route for propylene production. From an environmental perspective, PDH is seen as a more sustainable alternative to traditional production methods like steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking, which are characterized by high energy consumption and substantial carbon emissions. PDH aligns better with sustainable development criteria, particularly in terms of environmental protection and energy efficiency.

The growing adoption of PDH reflects the chemical industry's efforts to meet the increasing demand for propylene while addressing environmental concerns and energy efficiency requirements. This transition demonstrates the industry's adaptation to stricter sustainability standards and the need for more environmentally friendly production processes to meet the versatile applications of propylene across various sectors.

丙烯在化学工业中的重要性显著增长，2019年全球消费量达到1.15亿吨。这种不断增长的需求推动了丙烷脱氢（PDH）作为生产方法的更广泛采用。目前，PDH占全球丙烯产量的约10%，预计到2025年将增加到约30%。

转向PDH提供了经济和环境双重优势。它被认为是丙烯生产的经济可行路线。从环境角度来看，PDH被视为比传统生产方法（如蒸汽裂解和流化催化裂化）更可持续的替代方案，后者以高能耗和大量碳排放为特征。PDH更符合可持续发展标准，特别是在环境保护和能源效率方面。

PDH的日益采用反映了化学工业在满足丙烯不断增长的需求的同时，努力解决环境问题和能源效率要求。这种转变显示了该行业对更严格的可持续性标准的适应，以及对更环保的生产过程的需求，以满足丙烯在各个领域的多样化应用。
