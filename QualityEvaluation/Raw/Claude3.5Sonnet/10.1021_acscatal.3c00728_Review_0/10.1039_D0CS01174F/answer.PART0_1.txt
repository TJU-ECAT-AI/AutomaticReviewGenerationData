[1] "In 2019 the ever-growing worldwide consumption of ethylene and propylene soared to approximately 160 and 115 million tons, respectively (Fig. 1a)."

[2] "Currently about 10% of the global propylene is produced via propane dehydrogenation (PDH), which is considered an economically and environmentally friendly route. Hence, PDH is expected to be applied more widely in the forthcoming years according to a forecast that catalytic dehydrogenation of propane would supply approximately 30% of the global propylene production by the year 2025"

[3] "Since direct dehydrogenation is endothermic in nature, substantial energy input and high temperature is required to achieve acceptable conversion and high yield of target olefins, limiting its overall energy efficiency."

[4] "Oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of alkanes to olefins, featured by its intrinsic exothermicity and being free of coke, is a promising alternative to direct dehydrogenation."

Propene's significance in the chemical industry has grown substantially, with worldwide consumption reaching 115 million tons in 2019. This increasing demand is driving the adoption of propane dehydrogenation (PDH) as a preferred production method. Currently, PDH accounts for about 10% of global propylene production, but this is expected to increase to 30% by 2025.

The economic and environmental advantages of PDH in meeting the growing needs for propene include:

1. It is considered an economically and environmentally friendly route compared to traditional methods.

2. It allows for the utilization of abundant and low-cost propane from natural gas and shale gas resources.

3. It offers a more direct and efficient route to propene production compared to other methods like steam cracking or fluid catalytic cracking.

However, traditional PDH has some limitations, such as being endothermic and requiring substantial energy input and high temperatures. This has led to interest in oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) as a promising alternative, as it is exothermic and avoids coke formation issues. ODH potentially offers improved energy efficiency and reduced environmental impact in propene production.

丙烯在化工行业的重要性显著增长，2019年全球消耗量达到1.15亿吨。这种不断增长的需求正推动丙烷脱氢（PDH）成为首选的生产方法。目前，PDH占全球丙烯产量的约10%，但预计到2025年将增加到30%。

PDH在满足不断增长的丙烯需求方面具有以下经济和环境优势：

1. 与传统方法相比，它被认为是一种经济和环保的路线。

2. 它允许利用来自天然气和页岩气资源的丰富且低成本的丙烷。

3. 与其他方法（如蒸汽裂解或流化催化裂解）相比，它为丙烯生产提供了更直接和高效的路线。

然而，传统的PDH也有一些局限性，比如反应吸热，需要大量能量输入和高温。这导致人们对氧化脱氢（ODH）产生了兴趣，将其视为一种有前景的替代方案，因为它是放热的，并且避免了积碳问题。ODH有潜力在丙烯生产中提供更高的能源效率和更低的环境影响。
