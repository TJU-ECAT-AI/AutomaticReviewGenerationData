[1] "In 2019 the ever-growing worldwide consumption of ethylene and propylene soared to approximately 160 and 115 million tons, respectively (Fig. 1a)."

[2] "These light olefins are mainly produced from petroleum-derived steam cracking, fluid catalytic cracking (FCC), methanol to olefins (MTO) and FischerTropsch to olefins (FTO)."

[3] "Currently about 10% of the global propylene is produced via propane dehydrogenation (PDH), which is considered an economically and environmentally friendly route. Hence, PDH is expected to be applied more widely in the forthcoming years according to a forecast that catalytic dehydrogenation of propane would supply approximately 30% of the global propylene production by the year 2025"

[4] "Oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of alkanes to olefins, featured by its intrinsic exothermicity and being free of coke, is a promising alternative to direct dehydrogenation."

Propene's significance in the chemical industry has grown substantially, with worldwide consumption reaching 115 million tons in 2019. This increasing demand is driving the adoption of propane dehydrogenation (PDH) as a preferred production method. Currently, PDH accounts for about 10% of global propylene production, but it is expected to grow to approximately 30% by 2025.

The economic and environmental advantages of PDH in meeting the growing needs for propene include:

1. It is considered an economically viable route compared to traditional methods like steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking.

2. PDH is seen as a more environmentally friendly option.

3. It allows for the utilization of propane from natural gas and shale gas resources, which are becoming increasingly abundant.

4. Oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH), a variation of PDH, offers additional benefits such as being exothermic and coke-free, making it even more promising for industrial applications.

These advantages position PDH and ODH as attractive methods to meet the growing demand for propene across various applications in the chemical industry, while potentially reducing environmental impact and leveraging abundant feedstock resources.

丙烯在化学工业中的重要性已经显著增长，2019年全球消耗量达到1.15亿吨。这种不断增长的需求正推动丙烷脱氢(PDH)成为首选的生产方法。目前，PDH占全球丙烯产量的约10%，但预计到2025年将增长到约30%。

PDH在满足日益增长的丙烯需求方面具有以下经济和环境优势：

1. 与传统的蒸汽裂解和流化催化裂解相比，它被认为是一种经济可行的路线。

2. PDH被视为一种更环保的选择。

3. 它允许利用来自天然气和页岩气资源的丙烷，这些资源正变得越来越丰富。

4. 氧化脱氢(ODH)作为PDH的一种变体，提供了额外的优势，如放热和无积碳，使其在工业应用中更具前景。

这些优势使PDH和ODH成为满足化学工业各种应用中不断增长的丙烯需求的有吸引力的方法，同时有可能减少环境影响并利用丰富的原料资源。
