[1] "In 2019 the ever-growing worldwide consumption of ethylene and propylene soared to approximately 160 and 115 million tons, respectively (Fig. 1a)."

[2] "Currently about 10% of the global propylene is produced via propane dehydrogenation (PDH), which is considered an economically and environmentally friendly route. Hence, PDH is expected to be applied more widely in the forthcoming years according to a forecast that catalytic dehydrogenation of propane would supply approximately 30% of the global propylene production by the year 2025"

[3] "Since direct dehydrogenation is endothermic in nature, substantial energy input and high temperature is required to achieve acceptable conversion and high yield of target olefins, limiting its overall energy efficiency."

[4] "Oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of alkanes to olefins, featured by its intrinsic exothermicity and being free of coke, is a promising alternative to direct dehydrogenation."

Propene's significance in the chemical industry has grown substantially, with worldwide consumption reaching 115 million tons in 2019. This increasing demand is driving greater adoption of propane dehydrogenation (PDH) as a production method. Currently, PDH accounts for about 10% of global propylene production, but this is expected to increase to 30% by 2025.

The economic and environmental advantages of PDH in meeting growing propene needs include:

1. It is considered an economically viable route.
2. It is viewed as environmentally friendly compared to other methods.
3. It allows for direct conversion of propane, which is abundant in natural gas, to propylene.

However, traditional PDH has some limitations:

1. It is endothermic, requiring substantial energy input and high temperatures.
2. This limits its overall energy efficiency.

As an alternative, oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) offers some additional advantages:

1. It is exothermic, potentially requiring less energy input.
2. It is free of coke formation, which can be an issue in traditional PDH.

These factors make ODH a promising option for meeting the growing demand for propylene across various applications in a more sustainable and efficient manner.

丙烯在化学工业中的重要性已显著增长，2019年全球消费量达到1.15亿吨。这种不断增长的需求正推动丙烷脱氢（PDH）作为生产方法被更广泛地采用。目前，PDH占全球丙烯产量的约10%，预计到2025年将增加到30%。

PDH在满足不断增长的丙烯需求方面具有以下经济和环境优势：

1. 被认为是经济可行的路线。
2. 与其他方法相比，被视为环保友好。
3. 允许直接将天然气中丰富的丙烷转化为丙烯。

然而，传统的PDH也有一些局限性：

1. 它是吸热反应，需要大量能量输入和高温。
2. 这限制了其整体能源效率。

作为替代方案，氧化脱氢（ODH）提供了一些额外的优势：

1. 它是放热反应，可能需要较少的能量输入。
2. 它不会形成焦炭，这在传统PDH中可能是个问题。

这些因素使ODH成为一个更有前景的选择，可以以更可持续和高效的方式满足各种应用中不断增长的丙烯需求。
