          [1] "In 2019 the ever-growing worldwide consumption of ethylene and propylene soared to approximately 160 and 115 million tons, respectively (Fig. 1a)."

[2] "Currently about 10% of the global propylene is produced via propane dehydrogenation (PDH), which is considered an economically and environmentally friendly route. Hence, PDH is expected to be applied more widely in the forthcoming years according to a forecast that catalytic dehydrogenation of propane would supply approximately 30% of the global propylene production by the year 2025"

[3] "Since direct dehydrogenation is endothermic in nature, substantial energy input and high temperature is required to achieve acceptable conversion and high yield of target olefins, limiting its overall energy efficiency."

[4] "Oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of alkanes to olefins, featured by its intrinsic exothermicity and being free of coke, is a promising alternative to direct dehydrogenation."

[5] "These technologies in general feature high energy consumption and enormous carbon emission, and contradict sustainable development criteria that have strict requirements on environmental protection and energy-consumption."

          Propene's significance in the chemical industry has grown substantially, with worldwide consumption reaching 115 million tons in 2019. This increasing demand is driving the adoption of propane dehydrogenation (PDH) as a preferred production method. Currently, PDH accounts for about 10% of global propylene production, but it is expected to grow to approximately 30% by 2025.

The economic and environmental advantages of PDH in meeting the growing needs for propene include:

1. It is considered an economically viable and environmentally friendly route compared to traditional methods like steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking.
2. It allows for the utilization of abundant propane from natural gas and shale gas resources.
3. It offers a more direct and efficient route to propene production.

However, traditional PDH has some limitations:
1. It is endothermic, requiring substantial energy input and high temperatures.
2. This limits its overall energy efficiency.

As an alternative, oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) offers additional advantages:
1. It is exothermic, potentially requiring less energy input.
2. It is free of coke formation, which can be an issue in traditional PDH.

The shift towards PDH and ODH reflects the chemical industry's efforts to meet the increasing demand for propylene while addressing environmental concerns and energy efficiency requirements. This transition demonstrates the industry's adaptation to stricter sustainability standards and the need for more environmentally friendly production processes to meet the versatile applications of propylene across various sectors.

          丙烯在化学工业中的重要性显著增长，2019年全球消费量达到1.15亿吨。这种不断增长的需求推动了丙烷脱氢（PDH）作为首选生产方法的采用。目前，PDH占全球丙烯产量的约10%，但预计到2025年将增长到约30%。

PDH在满足不断增长的丙烯需求方面具有以下经济和环境优势：

1. 与传统的蒸汽裂解和流化催化裂解相比，它被认为是一种经济可行和环保友好的路线。
2. 它允许利用来自天然气和页岩气资源的丰富丙烷。
3. 它为丙烯生产提供了更直接和高效的路线。

然而，传统的PDH也有一些局限性：
1. 它是吸热反应，需要大量能量输入和高温。
2. 这限制了其整体能源效率。

作为替代方案，氧化脱氢（ODH）提供了额外的优势：
1. 它是放热反应，可能需要较少的能量输入。
2. 它不会形成焦炭，这在传统PDH中可能是个问题。

向PDH和ODH的转变反映了化学工业在满足丙烯不断增长的需求的同时，努力解决环境问题和能源效率要求。这种转变显示了该行业对更严格的可持续性标准的适应，以及对更环保的生产过程的需求，以满足丙烯在各个领域的多样化应用。
