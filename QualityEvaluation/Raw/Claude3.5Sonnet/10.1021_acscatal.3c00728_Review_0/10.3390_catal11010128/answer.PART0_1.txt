[1] "Propylene, relatively non-toxic to humans, is a widely used raw material in the production of several important chemicals like polypropylene, acrolein and isopropyl alcohol, among others"

[2] "Propylene manufacture via catalytic dehydrogenation of propane is a common practice and, is also one of the most promising methods given that propane is readily available in natural gas, and also, as a consequence of the discovery and exploration of shale gas"

Propene (propylene) has become increasingly significant in the chemical industry as a key raw material for producing important chemicals like polypropylene, acrolein, and isopropyl alcohol. Its growing demand has driven the adoption of propane dehydrogenation as a preferred production method. This approach offers economic and environmental advantages by utilizing readily available propane from natural gas and shale gas sources. The abundance of these feedstocks, especially with the recent exploration of shale gas, makes propane dehydrogenation a promising and sustainable method for meeting the rising demand for propylene across various industrial applications.
