[1] "Propylene, relatively non-toxic to humans, is a widely used raw material in the production of several important chemicals like polypropylene, acrolein and isopropyl alcohol, among others [1,2]."

[2] "Propylene manufacture via catalytic dehydrogenation of propane is a common practice and, is also one of the most promising methods given that propane is readily available in natural gas, and also, as a consequence of the discovery and exploration of shale gas [3]."

Propylene has become increasingly significant in the chemical industry as a key raw material for producing various important chemicals such as polypropylene, acrolein, and isopropyl alcohol. The growing demand for these products has driven the adoption of propane dehydrogenation as a preferred production method for propylene. This approach has gained popularity due to the readily available propane from natural gas sources, including the recent discovery and exploration of shale gas. The economic advantages of propane dehydrogenation stem from the abundance of feedstock, while the environmental benefits include the relatively non-toxic nature of propylene. This method helps meet the growing needs for this versatile olefin across various applications in a more sustainable and cost-effective manner.
