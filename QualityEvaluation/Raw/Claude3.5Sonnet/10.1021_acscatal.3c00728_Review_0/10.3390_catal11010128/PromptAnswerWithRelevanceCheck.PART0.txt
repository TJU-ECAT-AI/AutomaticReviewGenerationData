[1] "Propylene, relatively non-toxic to humans, is a widely used raw material in the production of several important chemicals like polypropylene, acrolein and isopropyl alcohol, among others"

[2] "Propylene manufacture via catalytic dehydrogenation of propane is a common practice and, is also one of the most promising methods given that propane is readily available in natural gas, and also, as a consequence of the discovery and exploration of shale gas"

Propene has become increasingly significant in the chemical industry as a key raw material for producing various important chemicals, including polypropylene, acrolein, and isopropyl alcohol. The growing demand for these products has driven the adoption of propane dehydrogenation as a preferred production method for propene. This approach has gained popularity due to the ready availability of propane from natural gas sources, including the recent exploitation of shale gas reserves. The economic advantages of this method stem from the abundant supply of propane feedstock, while environmental benefits may include the relatively low toxicity of propene compared to some other chemical precursors. As industries continue to expand their use of propene-derived products, propane dehydrogenation offers a scalable and potentially sustainable solution to meet the increasing demand for this versatile olefin across various applications.

Propylene has become increasingly significant in the chemical industry as a key raw material for producing various important chemicals like polypropylene, acrolein, and isopropyl alcohol. The growing demand for these products has driven the adoption of propane dehydrogenation as a preferred production method for propylene. This approach is particularly promising due to the ready availability of propane in natural gas and shale gas reserves. The economic advantages of propane dehydrogenation include utilizing abundant feedstock sources and potentially lower production costs compared to traditional methods. Environmentally, this process may offer benefits such as reduced carbon footprint if utilizing natural gas instead of oil-based feedstocks. However, the literature does not provide detailed information on the specific economic and environmental advantages, so further research would be needed to fully assess these aspects of propane dehydrogenation for meeting growing propylene demand across various applications.
