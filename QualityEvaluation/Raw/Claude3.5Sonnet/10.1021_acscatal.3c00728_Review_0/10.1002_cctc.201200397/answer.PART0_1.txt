[1] "Propylene is one of the most useful chemicals in the petrochemical industry because it can serve as a precursor for the production of valuable products such as cumene, acrylonitrile, propylene oxide, and polypropylene."

[2] "Of the processes used in the synthesis of propylene, the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane with CO2 (ODHP) has received considerable attention because it uses the greenhouse gas CO2."

The literature does not provide detailed information about the evolution of propene's significance in the chemical industry or the adoption of propane dehydrogenation as a preferred production method. However, it does mention that propylene is highly valuable in the petrochemical industry as a precursor for important products. The oxidative dehydrogenation of propane with CO2 (ODHP) is highlighted as an attractive process for propylene synthesis due to its use of the greenhouse gas CO2. This suggests some environmental advantages, but the document does not elaborate on economic benefits or discuss how this approach meets growing demand across various applications.

该文献并未提供关于丙烯在化学工业中重要性演变的详细信息,也没有讨论丙烷脱氢作为首选生产方法的采用情况。然而,它确实提到丙烯在石油化工行业作为重要产品的前体非常有价值。文中强调了以CO2进行丙烷氧化脱氢(ODHP)是一种有吸引力的丙烯合成工艺,因为它利用了温室气体CO2。这表明了一些环境优势,但文档并未详细说明经济效益,也没有讨论这种方法如何满足各种应用中日益增长的需求。
