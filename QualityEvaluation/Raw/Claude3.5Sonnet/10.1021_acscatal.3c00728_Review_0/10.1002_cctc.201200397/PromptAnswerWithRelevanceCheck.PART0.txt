<quotes>

[1] "Propylene is one of the most useful chemicals in the petrochemical industry because it can serve as a precursor for the production of valuable products such as cumene, acrylonitrile, propylene oxide, and polypropylene."

[2] "Of the processes used in the synthesis of propylene, the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane with CO2 (ODHP) has received considerable attention because it uses the greenhouse gas CO2."

</quotes>

<EnglishVersionAnswer>

The literature does not provide specific information about the evolution of propene's significance or the economic and environmental advantages of propane dehydrogenation. However, it does mention that propylene is a highly useful chemical in the petrochemical industry, serving as a precursor for valuable products like cumene, acrylonitrile, propylene oxide, and polypropylene. This indicates its importance across various applications.

The text also notes that oxidative dehydrogenation of propane with CO2 (ODHP) has gained attention as a production method for propylene because it utilizes the greenhouse gas CO2. This suggests a potential environmental advantage of this approach, as it may help reduce greenhouse gas emissions by using CO2 as a reactant. However, the document does not provide detailed information on the economic benefits or the extent to which this method is preferred over others.

文献中没有提供关于丙烯重要性演变或丙烷脱氢的经济和环境优势的具体信息。然而，它确实提到丙烯是石油化工行业中非常有用的化学品，可作为生产有价值产品如异丙苯、丙烯腈、环氧丙烷和聚丙烯的前体。这表明了它在各种应用中的重要性。

文本还指出，由于使用了温室气体CO2，用CO2进行丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）作为丙烯的生产方法引起了关注。这表明这种方法可能具有潜在的环境优势，因为它可能通过使用CO2作为反应物来帮助减少温室气体排放。然而，该文档并未提供关于经济效益或这种方法相对于其他方法更受青睐程度的详细信息。

The literature does not provide detailed information about the evolution of propene's significance in the chemical industry or the adoption of propane dehydrogenation as a preferred production method. However, it does mention that propylene is highly valuable in the petrochemical industry as a precursor for important products. The oxidative dehydrogenation of propane with CO2 (ODHP) is highlighted as an attractive process for propylene synthesis due to its use of the greenhouse gas CO2. This suggests some environmental advantages, but the document does not elaborate on economic benefits or discuss how this approach meets growing demand across various applications.

The literature does not directly address the evolution of propene's significance or the adoption of propane dehydrogenation as a preferred production method. However, it does highlight propylene's importance in the petrochemical industry as a precursor for valuable products like cumene, acrylonitrile, propylene oxide, and polypropylene. This suggests a wide range of applications and potentially growing demand.

The document mentions oxidative dehydrogenation of propane with CO2 (ODHP) as a process for propylene synthesis that has gained attention. One environmental advantage of this approach is that it utilizes CO2, a greenhouse gas, as a reactant. This could potentially help reduce CO2 emissions while producing a valuable chemical product.

The literature does not provide information on economic advantages or specific details about meeting growing needs across various applications. To fully answer the question, more information would be needed on propene demand trends, comparative economics of different production methods, and quantitative environmental impacts.
