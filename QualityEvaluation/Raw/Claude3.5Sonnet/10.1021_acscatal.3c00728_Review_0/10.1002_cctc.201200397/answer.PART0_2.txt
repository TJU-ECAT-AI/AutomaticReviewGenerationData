[1] "Propylene is one of the most useful chemicals in the petrochemical industry because it can serve as a precursor for the production of valuable products such as cumene, acrylonitrile, propylene oxide, and polypropylene."

[2] "Of the processes used in the synthesis of propylene, the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane with CO2 (ODHP) has received considerable attention because it uses the greenhouse gas CO2."

The literature does not provide comprehensive information about the evolution of propene's significance in the chemical industry or detailed economic and environmental advantages of propane dehydrogenation. However, it does indicate that propylene is a highly valuable chemical in the petrochemical industry, serving as a precursor for important products like cumene, acrylonitrile, propylene oxide, and polypropylene. The oxidative dehydrogenation of propane with CO2 (ODHP) is mentioned as a process gaining attention for propylene production, partly due to its use of the greenhouse gas CO2. This suggests some environmental benefit, but the text does not elaborate on economic advantages or compare ODHP to other production methods.

文献没有提供关于丙烯在化学工业中重要性演变的全面信息，也没有详细说明丙烷脱氢的经济和环境优势。然而，它确实指出丙烯是石油化工行业中一种非常有价值的化学品，可作为生产重要产品如异丙苯、丙烯腈、环氧丙烷和聚丙烯的前体。文中提到了利用二氧化碳进行丙烷氧化脱氢(ODHP)这一工艺正在受到关注，部分原因是它利用了温室气体二氧化碳。这暗示了一些环境效益，但文本并未详细阐述经济优势或将ODHP与其他生产方法进行比较。
