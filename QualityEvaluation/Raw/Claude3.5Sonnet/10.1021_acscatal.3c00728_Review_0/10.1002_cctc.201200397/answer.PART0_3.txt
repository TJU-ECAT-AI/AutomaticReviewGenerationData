[1] "Propylene is one of the most useful chemicals in the petrochemical industry because it can serve as a precursor for the production of valuable products such as cumene, acrylonitrile, propylene oxide, and polypropylene."

[2] "Of the processes used in the synthesis of propylene, the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane with CO2 (ODHP) has received considerable attention because it uses the greenhouse gas CO2."

The literature does not directly address the evolution of propene's significance or the adoption of propane dehydrogenation as a preferred production method. However, it does highlight propylene's importance in the petrochemical industry as a precursor for valuable products like cumene, acrylonitrile, propylene oxide, and polypropylene. This suggests a wide range of applications and potentially growing demand.

The document mentions oxidative dehydrogenation of propane with CO2 (ODHP) as a process for propylene synthesis that has gained attention. One environmental advantage of this approach is that it utilizes CO2, a greenhouse gas, as a reactant. This could potentially help reduce CO2 emissions while producing a valuable chemical product.

The literature does not provide information on economic advantages or specific details about meeting growing needs across various applications. To fully answer the question, more information would be needed on propene demand trends, comparative economics of different production methods, and quantitative environmental impacts.

文献并未直接讨论丙烯重要性的演变或丙烷脱氢作为首选生产方法的采用情况。然而，它确实强调了丙烯在石油化工行业的重要性，作为生产异丙苯、丙烯腈、环氧丙烷和聚丙烯等有价值产品的前体。这表明丙烯有广泛的应用范围，可能需求不断增长。

文件提到了使用二氧化碳进行丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）作为一种引起关注的丙烯合成过程。这种方法的一个环境优势是它利用温室气体CO2作为反应物。这可能有助于在生产有价值的化学产品的同时减少CO2排放。

文献没有提供关于经济优势或满足各种应用不断增长需求的具体细节。要全面回答这个问题，还需要更多关于丙烯需求趋势、不同生产方法的比较经济性以及量化环境影响的信息。
