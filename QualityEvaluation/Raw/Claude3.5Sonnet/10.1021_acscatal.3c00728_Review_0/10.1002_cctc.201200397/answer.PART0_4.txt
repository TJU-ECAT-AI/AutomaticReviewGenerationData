[1] "Propylene is one of the most useful chemicals in the petrochemical industry because it can serve as a precursor for the production of valuable products such as cumene, acrylonitrile, propylene oxide, and polypropylene."

[2] "Of the processes used in the synthesis of propylene, the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane with CO2 (ODHP) has received considerable attention because it uses the greenhouse gas CO2."

The literature does not provide specific information about the evolution of propene's significance in the chemical industry or details on the adoption of propane dehydrogenation as a preferred production method. However, it does indicate that propylene is highly valuable in the petrochemical industry as a precursor for important products like cumene, acrylonitrile, propylene oxide, and polypropylene. 

The oxidative dehydrogenation of propane with CO2 (ODHP) is mentioned as a process that has gained attention for propylene synthesis, primarily due to its use of the greenhouse gas CO2. This suggests an environmental advantage of the ODHP approach, as it utilizes a greenhouse gas in the production process. However, the document does not provide detailed information on the economic advantages or how this method specifically meets growing needs across various applications.

文献没有提供关于丙烯在化学工业中重要性演变的具体信息，也没有详细说明丙烷脱氢作为首选生产方法的采用情况。但是，它确实表明丙烯在石油化工行业中非常有价值，是生产重要产品如异丙苯、丙烯腈、环氧丙烷和聚丙烯的前体。

文中提到丙烷与二氧化碳的氧化脱氢（ODHP）作为一种合成丙烯的方法受到了关注，主要是因为它使用了温室气体二氧化碳。这表明ODHP方法具有环境优势，因为它在生产过程中利用了温室气体。然而，文档并未提供关于经济优势的详细信息，也没有具体说明这种方法如何满足各种应用领域日益增长的需求。
