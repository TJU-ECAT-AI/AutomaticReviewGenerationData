[1] "Propylene is one of the important feedstocks in the chemical industry to produce different valuable products. Approximately two thirds of the propylene produced worldwide is consumed in the production of thermoplastic polypropylene, a commonly used compound in the fabrication of household appliances, plastic films and many other applications. The present worldwide propylene sales/demand reaches over ninety billion dollars."

[2] "Contrary to the above discussed commercial processes, the oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of propane to propylene is more attractive due to its low operational cost and minimal environmental impacts. The abundant availability of propane in natural gas and refinery off gases can make the propylene production by ODH propane even more sustainable compared to the conventional processes."

Propene's significance in the chemical industry has grown substantially, with worldwide demand now exceeding $90 billion. It is a crucial feedstock for producing various valuable products, with about two-thirds of global production used to make thermoplastic polypropylene. This versatile material is widely used in household appliances, plastic films, and many other applications.

The increasing demand for propene is driving the adoption of propane dehydrogenation, particularly oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH), as a preferred production method. ODH of propane to propylene offers several economic and environmental advantages compared to conventional processes:

1. Lower operational costs
2. Minimal environmental impacts
3. Increased sustainability due to the abundant availability of propane in natural gas and refinery off-gases

These benefits make ODH an attractive alternative to traditional propene production methods, allowing manufacturers to meet the growing demand for this versatile olefin more efficiently and sustainably across various industrial applications.

丙烯在化工行业的重要性显著增长，全球需求现已超过900亿美元。它是生产各种有价值产品的关键原料，全球约三分之二的产量用于生产热塑性聚丙烯。这种多功能材料广泛应用于家用电器、塑料薄膜和许多其他领域。

丙烯需求的不断增长推动了丙烷脱氢，特别是氧化脱氢（ODH）作为首选生产方法的采用。与传统工艺相比，丙烷到丙烯的ODH提供了多项经济和环境优势：

1. 较低的运营成本
2. 最小的环境影响
3. 由于天然气和炼油厂尾气中丙烷的丰富可用性，可持续性更高

这些优势使ODH成为传统丙烯生产方法的有吸引力的替代方案，使制造商能够更高效、更可持续地满足各种工业应用对这种多功能烯烃日益增长的需求。
