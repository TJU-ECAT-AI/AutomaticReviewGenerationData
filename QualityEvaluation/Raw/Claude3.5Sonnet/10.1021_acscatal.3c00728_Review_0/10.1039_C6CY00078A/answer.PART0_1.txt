[1] "Propylene is one of the important feedstocks in the chemical industry to produce different valuable products. Approximately two thirds of the propylene produced worldwide is consumed in the production of thermoplastic polypropylene, a commonly used compound in the fabrication of household appliances, plastic films and many other applications. The present worldwide propylene sales/demand reaches over ninety billion dollars."

[2] "Contrary to the above discussed commercial processes, the oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of propane to propylene is more attractive due to its low operational cost and minimal environmental impacts. The abundant availability of propane in natural gas and refinery off gases can make the propylene production by ODH propane even more sustainable compared to the conventional processes."

Propylene has become a crucial feedstock in the chemical industry, with its importance growing significantly. The demand for propylene has increased to the point where worldwide sales now exceed $90 billion. This rising demand is driven by its versatile applications, particularly in the production of thermoplastic polypropylene, which accounts for about two-thirds of global propylene consumption. Thermoplastic polypropylene is widely used in manufacturing household appliances, plastic films, and numerous other products.

The increasing demand for propylene has led to a shift towards propane dehydrogenation as a preferred production method. This shift is primarily due to the economic and environmental advantages of this approach. Propane dehydrogenation, specifically oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of propane, offers lower operational costs compared to conventional methods. It also has minimal environmental impacts, making it a more sustainable option.

Additionally, the abundance of propane in natural gas and refinery off-gases further enhances the sustainability and economic viability of propane dehydrogenation. This availability of raw materials contributes to making ODH of propane an attractive alternative to traditional propylene production methods, aligning with the growing need for more environmentally friendly and cost-effective manufacturing processes in the chemical industry.

丙烯已成为化学工业中的一种关键原料，其重要性显著增长。丙烯的需求已经增加到全球销售额超过900亿美元的程度。这种不断增长的需求主要来自于其广泛的应用，特别是在热塑性聚丙烯的生产中，占全球丙烯消耗量的约三分之二。热塑性聚丙烯广泛应用于家用电器、塑料薄膜和许多其他产品的制造。

丙烯需求的增加导致了向丙烷脱氢作为首选生产方法的转变。这种转变主要是由于这种方法在经济和环境方面的优势。丙烷脱氢，特别是丙烷的氧化脱氢（ODH），与传统方法相比具有更低的运营成本。它还具有最小的环境影响，使其成为一个更可持续的选择。

此外，天然气和炼油厂尾气中丙烷的丰富进一步提高了丙烷脱氢的可持续性和经济可行性。这种原材料的可用性有助于使丙烷ODH成为传统丙烯生产方法的一个有吸引力的替代方案，符合化学工业对更环保和成本效益更高的制造过程的日益增长的需求。
