[1] "Propylene is one of the important feedstocks in the chemical industry to produce different valuable products. Approximately two thirds of the propylene produced worldwide is consumed in the production of thermoplastic polypropylene, a commonly used compound in the fabrication of household appliances, plastic films and many other applications. The present worldwide propylene sales/demand reaches over ninety billion dollars."

[2] "Contrary to the above discussed commercial processes, the oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of propane to propylene is more attractive due to its low operational cost and minimal environmental impacts. The abundant availability of propane in natural gas and refinery off gases can make the propylene production by ODH propane even more sustainable compared to the conventional processes."

Propylene has become an increasingly important feedstock in the chemical industry, with worldwide demand reaching over $90 billion. Its significance has grown due to its versatile applications, particularly in the production of thermoplastic polypropylene used in household appliances, plastic films, and many other products. About two-thirds of global propylene production is consumed in making polypropylene.

The adoption of propane dehydrogenation, specifically oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH), as a preferred production method is driven by several factors. Economically, ODH offers lower operational costs compared to conventional processes. Environmentally, it has minimal impacts. Additionally, the abundant availability of propane in natural gas and refinery off gases makes this approach more sustainable than traditional methods.

The growing demand for propylene across various applications, coupled with the economic and environmental advantages of ODH, is pushing the industry towards adopting this method. It offers a more efficient and sustainable way to meet the increasing needs for this versatile olefin, aligning with both market demands and environmental considerations.

丙烯已经成为化工行业越来越重要的原料，全球需求达到900多亿美元。由于其在家用电器、塑料薄膜和许多其他产品中的多种应用，特别是在热塑性聚丙烯的生产中，其重要性不断增加。全球约三分之二的丙烯产量用于生产聚丙烯。

采用丙烷脱氢法，特别是氧化脱氢法（ODH）作为首选生产方法，是由多个因素驱动的。从经济角度来看，与传统工艺相比，ODH的运营成本更低。从环境角度来看，它的影响最小。此外，天然气和炼油厂尾气中丙烷的大量存在使得这种方法比传统方法更加可持续。

丙烯在各种应用中不断增长的需求，加上ODH在经济和环境方面的优势，正推动行业采用这种方法。它提供了一种更高效、更可持续的方式来满足这种多功能烯烃日益增长的需求，既符合市场需求，又考虑到环境因素。
