[1] "Propylene is one of the important feedstocks in the chemical industry to produce different valuable products. Approximately two thirds of the propylene produced worldwide is consumed in the production of thermoplastic polypropylene, a commonly used compound in the fabrication of household appliances, plastic films and many other applications. The present worldwide propylene sales/demand reaches over ninety billion dollars."

[2] "Contrary to the above discussed commercial processes, the oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of propane to propylene is more attractive due to its low operational cost and minimal environmental impacts. The abundant availability of propane in natural gas and refinery off gases can make the propylene production by ODH propane even more sustainable compared to the conventional processes."

Propylene has become an increasingly important feedstock in the chemical industry, with global demand reaching over $90 billion. Its significance has grown due to its versatile applications, particularly in the production of thermoplastic polypropylene, which is used in household appliances, plastic films, and many other products. About two-thirds of worldwide propylene production goes into making polypropylene.

The adoption of propane dehydrogenation, specifically oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH), as a preferred production method is driven by several factors. Economically, ODH offers lower operational costs compared to conventional processes. Environmentally, it has minimal impacts. Additionally, the abundant availability of propane in natural gas and refinery off gases makes this approach more sustainable than traditional methods.

The growing needs for propylene across various applications are better met through ODH due to its economic and environmental advantages. This method allows for more efficient and cost-effective production to keep up with increasing demand, while also aligning with sustainability goals in the chemical industry.

丙烯已成为化工行业中越来越重要的原料，全球需求已达900多亿美元。由于其在生产热塑性聚丙烯方面的广泛应用，特别是在家用电器、塑料薄膜和许多其他产品中的应用，其重要性日益增长。全球约三分之二的丙烯产量用于生产聚丙烯。

采用丙烷脱氢法，特别是氧化脱氢法（ODH）作为首选生产方法，是由几个因素驱动的。从经济角度来看，与传统工艺相比，ODH的运营成本更低。从环境角度来看，它的影响最小。此外，天然气和炼油厂尾气中丙烷的大量存在使得这种方法比传统方法更具可持续性。

由于ODH在经济和环境方面的优势，它能更好地满足丙烯在各种应用中不断增长的需求。这种方法允许更高效、更具成本效益的生产，以跟上不断增长的需求，同时也符合化工行业的可持续发展目标。
