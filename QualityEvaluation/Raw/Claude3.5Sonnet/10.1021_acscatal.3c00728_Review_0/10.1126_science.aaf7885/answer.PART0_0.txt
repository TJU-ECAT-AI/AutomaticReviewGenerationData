[1] "Propene is one of the highest-volume organic chemicals produced. Propene has mainly been made from naphtha, but changes in the global supply chain are creating shortages."

[2] "Direct conversion from propane, a component of natural gas, via reaction with oxygen is an attractive alternative, but existing approaches produce a large fraction of unwanted CO and CO2."

[3] "Although propene is conventionally produced via steam cracking of large hydrocarbons in naphtha, the more recent trend to use shale gas as feeds to steam cracker units greatly increases the availability of low-cost ethene but also results in a gap between demand and supply of propene, as well as other higher olefins"

[4] "This disparity motivates the exploration of on-purpose propene technologies. Even though nonoxidative propane dehydrogenation is the emerging technology used today, ODHP has the potential to improve reaction efficiency over its nonoxidative counterpart because of favorable thermodynamics (exothermic and lower reaction temperatures) and enhanced catalyst stability (prevention of coke deposition on the catalyst surface)."

Propene's significance in the chemical industry has evolved due to changes in the global supply chain. Traditionally produced from naphtha, propene is now facing shortages as the industry shifts towards using shale gas for steam cracking. This shift has increased the availability of low-cost ethene but created a gap between propene demand and supply.

The growing demand for propene is driving the adoption of propane dehydrogenation as a preferred production method. Specifically, oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) is being explored as an on-purpose propene technology. ODHP offers several advantages over nonoxidative propane dehydrogenation, including improved reaction efficiency, favorable thermodynamics, and enhanced catalyst stability.

The economic and environmental advantages of ODHP in meeting the growing needs for propene include:

1. Energy savings: It is estimated that moving to ODHP could result in a 45% reduction in energy consumption compared to current methods.

2. Lower reaction temperatures: ODHP operates at lower temperatures, which can lead to reduced operational costs.

3. Exothermic reaction: The exothermic nature of ODHP can potentially improve overall process efficiency.

4. Enhanced catalyst stability: ODHP prevents coke deposition on the catalyst surface, potentially reducing maintenance costs and improving longevity of catalysts.

5. Utilization of natural gas: ODHP allows for the direct conversion of propane, a component of natural gas, providing a new pathway for utilizing this abundant resource.

These advantages position ODHP as a promising technology to meet the increasing demand for propene across various applications while potentially offering both economic and environmental benefits to the chemical industry.

丙烯在化工行业的重要性已经发生了演变，这是由于全球供应链的变化。传统上，丙烯主要由石脑油生产，但随着行业转向使用页岩气进行蒸汽裂解，丙烯现在面临短缺。这种转变增加了低成本乙烯的供应，但也造成了丙烯供需之间的差距。

丙烯需求的增长正在推动丙烷脱氢作为首选生产方法的采用。具体而言，正在探索丙烷的氧化脱氢（ODHP）作为一种定向丙烯生产技术。与非氧化丙烷脱氢相比，ODHP提供了几个优势，包括改进的反应效率、有利的热力学特性和增强的催化剂稳定性。

ODHP在满足丙烯不断增长的需求方面的经济和环境优势包括：

1. 节能：据估计，转向ODHP可以比当前方法减少45%的能源消耗。

2. 较低的反应温度：ODHP在较低的温度下运行，可能导致运营成本降低。

3. 放热反应：ODHP的放热性质可能提高整体过程效率。

4. 增强的催化剂稳定性：ODHP防止催化剂表面的焦炭沉积，可能降低维护成本并提高催化剂的使用寿命。

5. 天然气的利用：ODHP允许直接转化丙烷（天然气的一种成分），为利用这种丰富资源提供了新的途径。

这些优势使ODHP成为一种有前景的技术，可以满足各种应用中不断增长的丙烯需求，同时为化工行业带来潜在的经济和环境效益。
