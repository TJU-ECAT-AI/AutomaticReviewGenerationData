[1] "Propene is one of the highest-volume organic chemicals produced. Propene has mainly been made from naphtha, but changes in the global supply chain are creating shortages."

[2] "Although propene is conventionally produced via steam cracking of large hydrocarbons in naphtha, the more recent trend to use shale gas as feeds to steam cracker units greatly increases the availability of low-cost ethene but also results in a gap between demand and supply of propene, as well as other higher olefins"

[3] "This disparity motivates the exploration of on-purpose propene technologies. Even though nonoxidative propane dehydrogenation is the emerging technology used today, ODHP has the potential to improve reaction efficiency over its nonoxidative counterpart because of favorable thermodynamics (exothermic and lower reaction temperatures) and enhanced catalyst stability (prevention of coke deposition on the catalyst surface)."

[4] "It is estimated that the potential energy savings for moving to ODHP would be 45% of the energy consumption"

[5] "This gain in reaction efficiency, coupled with the facts that demand for propene is around 100,000 kt and its production consumes around 1 quad of energy, illustrates the potential impact of ODHP if it could be implemented on a large scale."

Propene's significance in the chemical industry has evolved due to changes in the global supply chain. Traditionally produced from naphtha, propene is now facing shortages as the industry shifts towards using shale gas for steam cracking. This shift has increased the availability of low-cost ethene but created a gap between propene supply and demand.

The growing demand for propene is driving the adoption of propane dehydrogenation as a preferred production method. Specifically, oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) is being explored as an on-purpose propene technology. ODHP offers several advantages over non-oxidative methods, including improved reaction efficiency, favorable thermodynamics (exothermic reaction and lower temperatures), and enhanced catalyst stability.

The economic and environmental advantages of ODHP in meeting the growing needs for propene are significant. It is estimated that switching to ODHP could result in energy savings of up to 45% compared to current production methods. Given that propene demand is around 100,000 kt and its production consumes about 1 quad of energy, implementing ODHP on a large scale could have a substantial impact on energy efficiency in the chemical industry. These advantages make ODHP an attractive option for meeting the increasing demand for propene across various applications while potentially reducing environmental impact through improved energy efficiency.

由于全球供应链的变化，丙烯在化学工业中的重要性已经发生了演变。传统上从石脑油生产的丙烯，现在由于行业转向使用页岩气进行蒸汽裂解而面临短缺。这种转变增加了低成本乙烯的供应，但也造成了丙烯供需之间的差距。

丙烯需求的增长推动了丙烷脱氢作为首选生产方法的采用。具体来说，正在探索丙烷的氧化脱氢（ODHP）作为一种定向丙烯技术。与非氧化方法相比，ODHP提供了几个优势，包括提高反应效率、有利的热力学特性（放热反应和较低温度），以及增强的催化剂稳定性。

ODHP在满足丙烯不断增长的需求方面具有显著的经济和环境优势。据估计，转向ODHP可能会使能源消耗减少45%。考虑到丙烯需求约为10万千吨，其生产消耗约1夸能源，大规模实施ODHP可能会对化学工业的能源效率产生重大影响。这些优势使ODHP成为满足各种应用中丙烯不断增长需求的有吸引力的选择，同时通过提高能源效率可能减少环境影响。
