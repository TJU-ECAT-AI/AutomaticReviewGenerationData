[1] "Propene is one of the highest-volume organic chemicals produced. Propene has mainly been made from naphtha, but changes in the global supply chain are creating shortages."

[2] "Although propene is conventionally produced via steam cracking of large hydrocarbons in naphtha, the more recent trend to use shale gas as feeds to steam cracker units greatly increases the availability of low-cost ethene but also results in a gap between demand and supply of propene, as well as other higher olefins"

[3] "This disparity motivates the exploration of on-purpose propene technologies. Even though nonoxidative propane dehydrogenation is the emerging technology used today, ODHP has the potential to improve reaction efficiency over its nonoxidative counterpart because of favorable thermodynamics (exothermic and lower reaction temperatures) and enhanced catalyst stability (prevention of coke deposition on the catalyst surface)."

[4] "It is estimated that the potential energy savings for moving to ODHP would be 45% of the energy consumption"

[5] "This gain in reaction efficiency, coupled with the facts that demand for propene is around 100,000 kt and its production consumes around 1 quad of energy, illustrates the potential impact of ODHP if it could be implemented on a large scale."

Propene's significance in the chemical industry has evolved due to changes in global supply chains, creating shortages in its traditional production from naphtha. The increasing demand for propene, coupled with shifts in feedstock availability, has driven the adoption of propane dehydrogenation as a preferred production method.

The use of shale gas in steam cracker units has increased the availability of low-cost ethene but created a gap between propene supply and demand. This disparity has motivated the exploration of on-purpose propene technologies, with oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) showing particular promise.

The economic and environmental advantages of ODHP in meeting the growing needs for propene include:

1. Improved reaction efficiency: ODHP offers favorable thermodynamics with lower reaction temperatures and exothermic reactions.

2. Enhanced catalyst stability: ODHP prevents coke deposition on the catalyst surface.

3. Significant energy savings: It is estimated that moving to ODHP could reduce energy consumption by 45%.

4. Large-scale impact potential: With propene demand around 100,000 kt and its production consuming about 1 quad of energy, ODHP implementation on a large scale could have substantial economic and environmental benefits.

These advantages position ODHP as a promising method to meet the growing demand for propene across various applications while addressing economic and environmental concerns in the chemical industry.

丙烯在化学工业中的重要性已经发生了演变，这是由于全球供应链的变化导致了其传统的石脑油生产方式出现短缺。丙烯需求的增加，加上原料供应的变化，推动了丙烷脱氢作为首选生产方法的采用。

在蒸汽裂解装置中使用页岩气增加了低成本乙烯的供应，但也造成了丙烯供需之间的差距。这种差异促使人们探索定向丙烯生产技术，其中丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）显示出特别的潜力。

ODHP在满足不断增长的丙烯需求方面的经济和环境优势包括：

1. 提高反应效率：ODHP具有有利的热力学特性，反应温度较低，反应为放热反应。

2. 增强催化剂稳定性：ODHP可防止催化剂表面的积碳。

3. 显著的能源节省：据估计，转向ODHP可以减少45%的能源消耗。

4. 大规模影响潜力：丙烯需求约为10万千吨，其生产消耗约1夸德的能源，大规模实施ODHP可能会带来巨大的经济和环境效益。

这些优势使ODHP成为一种有前景的方法，可以满足各种应用中不断增长的丙烯需求，同时解决化学工业中的经济和环境问题。
