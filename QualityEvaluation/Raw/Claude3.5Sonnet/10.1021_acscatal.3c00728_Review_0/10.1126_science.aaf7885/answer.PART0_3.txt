[1] "Propene is one of the highest-volume organic chemicals produced. Propene has mainly been made from naphtha, but changes in the global supply chain are creating shortages."

[2] "Although propene is conventionally produced via steam cracking of large hydrocarbons in naphtha, the more recent trend to use shale gas as feeds to steam cracker units greatly increases the availability of low-cost ethene but also results in a gap between demand and supply of propene, as well as other higher olefins"

[3] "This disparity motivates the exploration of on-purpose propene technologies. Even though nonoxidative propane dehydrogenation is the emerging technology used today, ODHP has the potential to improve reaction efficiency over its nonoxidative counterpart because of favorable thermodynamics (exothermic and lower reaction temperatures) and enhanced catalyst stability (prevention of coke deposition on the catalyst surface)."

[4] "It is estimated that the potential energy savings for moving to ODHP would be 45% of the energy consumption"

[5] "This gain in reaction efficiency, coupled with the facts that demand for propene is around 100,000 kt and its production consumes around 1 quad of energy, illustrates the potential impact of ODHP if it could be implemented on a large scale."

Propene's significance in the chemical industry has evolved due to changes in global supply chains and production methods. Traditionally, propene was primarily produced from naphtha through steam cracking. However, the recent shift towards using shale gas in steam cracker units has led to an abundance of low-cost ethene but created a shortage of propene and other higher olefins.

This supply-demand gap has driven the adoption of propane dehydrogenation as a preferred production method, specifically on-purpose propene technologies. While non-oxidative propane dehydrogenation is currently the emerging technology, oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) shows great potential for improving reaction efficiency.

The economic and environmental advantages of ODHP in meeting the growing needs for propene include:

1. Improved reaction efficiency due to favorable thermodynamics (exothermic reaction and lower reaction temperatures).
2. Enhanced catalyst stability by preventing coke deposition on the catalyst surface.
3. Potential energy savings of up to 45% compared to current production methods.
4. Ability to meet the high demand for propene (around 100,000 kt) while potentially reducing the significant energy consumption (currently around 1 quad) associated with its production.

These advantages make ODHP an attractive option for large-scale implementation, potentially revolutionizing propene production to meet the growing needs across various applications in the chemical industry.

丙烯在化工行业的重要性已经发生了演变，这是由于全球供应链和生产方法的变化。传统上，丙烯主要通过石脑油蒸汽裂解生产。然而，最近向页岩气作为蒸汽裂解装置原料的转变导致了低成本乙烯的丰富，但也造成了丙烯和其他高级烯烃的短缺。

这种供需差距推动了丙烷脱氢作为首选生产方法的采用，特别是定向丙烯技术。虽然非氧化丙烷脱氢目前是新兴技术，但丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）显示出提高反应效率的巨大潜力。

ODHP在满足日益增长的丙烯需求方面的经济和环境优势包括：

1. 由于有利的热力学条件（放热反应和较低的反应温度），反应效率得到提高。
2. 通过防止焦炭沉积在催化剂表面上，提高了催化剂的稳定性。
3. 与当前生产方法相比，潜在节能可达45%。
4. 能够满足丙烯的高需求（约100,000千吨），同时可能减少与其生产相关的大量能源消耗（目前约1夸德）。

这些优势使ODHP成为大规模实施的一个有吸引力的选择，有可能彻底改变丙烯生产，以满足化工行业各种应用中日益增长的需求。
