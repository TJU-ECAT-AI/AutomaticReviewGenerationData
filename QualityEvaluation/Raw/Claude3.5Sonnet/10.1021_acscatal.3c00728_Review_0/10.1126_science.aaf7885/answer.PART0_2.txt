[1] "Propene is one of the highest-volume organic chemicals produced. Propene has mainly been made from naphtha, but changes in the global supply chain are creating shortages."

[2] "Although propene is conventionally produced via steam cracking of large hydrocarbons in naphtha, the more recent trend to use shale gas as feeds to steam cracker units greatly increases the availability of low-cost ethene but also results in a gap between demand and supply of propene, as well as other higher olefins"

[3] "This disparity motivates the exploration of on-purpose propene technologies. Even though nonoxidative propane dehydrogenation is the emerging technology used today, ODHP has the potential to improve reaction efficiency over its nonoxidative counterpart because of favorable thermodynamics (exothermic and lower reaction temperatures) and enhanced catalyst stability (prevention of coke deposition on the catalyst surface)."

[4] "It is estimated that the potential energy savings for moving to ODHP would be 45% of the energy consumption"

[5] "This gain in reaction efficiency, coupled with the facts that demand for propene is around 100,000 kt and its production consumes around 1 quad of energy, illustrates the potential impact of ODHP if it could be implemented on a large scale."

Propene's significance in the chemical industry has evolved due to changes in the global supply chain. Traditionally produced from naphtha, propene is now facing shortages as the industry shifts towards using shale gas in steam cracker units. This shift has increased the availability of low-cost ethene but created a gap between propene demand and supply.

The growing demand for propene is driving the adoption of propane dehydrogenation as a preferred production method. Specifically, oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) is being explored as an on-purpose propene technology. While non-oxidative propane dehydrogenation is currently the emerging technology, ODHP offers potential improvements in reaction efficiency.

The economic and environmental advantages of ODHP in meeting the growing needs for propene include:

1. Improved reaction efficiency due to favorable thermodynamics (exothermic reaction and lower reaction temperatures).
2. Enhanced catalyst stability by preventing coke deposition on the catalyst surface.
3. Potential energy savings of up to 45% compared to current production methods.
4. Ability to meet the high demand for propene (around 100,000 kt) more efficiently.
5. Significant potential impact on the chemical industry if implemented on a large scale, given that propene production currently consumes around 1 quad of energy.

These advantages make ODHP an attractive option for meeting the increasing demand for propene across various applications while potentially reducing energy consumption and improving overall production efficiency.

由于全球供应链的变化，丙烯在化工行业的重要性已经发生了演变。传统上，丙烯主要从石脑油中生产，但随着行业转向在蒸汽裂解装置中使用页岩气，丙烯正面临短缺。这种转变增加了低成本乙烯的供应，但也造成了丙烯供需之间的缺口。

丙烯需求的增长正推动丙烷脱氢成为首选的生产方法。具体而言，正在探索丙烷的氧化脱氢（ODHP）作为一种定向丙烯技术。虽然非氧化丙烷脱氢目前是新兴技术，但ODHP在反应效率方面提供了潜在的改进。

ODHP在满足丙烯不断增长的需求方面的经济和环境优势包括：

1. 由于热力学有利（放热反应和较低的反应温度），反应效率得到提高。
2. 通过防止焦炭沉积在催化剂表面，提高了催化剂的稳定性。
3. 与当前生产方法相比，可能节省高达45%的能源。
4. 能够更有效地满足丙烯的高需求（约100,000千吨）。
5. 如果在大规模实施，将对化工行业产生重大影响，考虑到目前丙烯生产消耗约1夸的能量。

这些优势使ODHP成为满足各种应用中不断增长的丙烯需求的一个有吸引力的选择，同时可能减少能源消耗并提高整体生产效率。
