I'm going to give you a scientific literature. Then I'm going to ask you some questions about it. I'd like you to first write down exact quotes of parts of the document word by word that would help answer the question, and then I'd like you to answer the question using facts from the quoted content. Do not omit any relevant information from the text, and avoid introducing any falsehoods or assumptions that aren't directly supported by the literature.

Abstract
BP mixed oxide was the active and selective catalyst for partial oxidation of propane. The selectivity and the yield of the partial oxidation products (propionaldehyde, acetone, acetaldehyde, propylene, etc.) were 50% and 27%, respectively, under the reaction conditions; T=806 K, P(C3H8)=20 kPa, P(O2)=30 kPa,and W/F=0.67 g h 11.

Here are the question lists, in <questions></questions>XML tags:
<questions>


How has propene's significance in the chemical industry evolved, and in what ways does its increasing demand drive the adoption of propane dehydrogenation as a preferred production method? Additionally, what are the economic and environmental advantages of this approach in meeting the growing needs for this versatile olefin across various applications?


</questions>

First, you need to sequentially extract any quotes in the literature that are most relevant to each question, and print them in numbered order, separated by newlines. Quotes should be relatively brief. Do not attempt to summarize or answer questions at this stage, but simply repeat exactly what the corresponding part of the literature says.

Please enclose the full list of quotes in <quotes></quotes> XML tags. If there are no relevant quotes, write "No relevant quotes" instead.

Then, answer the question, starting with "Answer:".  Do not include or reference quoted content verbatim in the answer. Don't say "According to Quote [1]" when answering. Do not write reference number of quotes after answer. Put your answer to the user inside <EnglishVersionAnswer></EnglishVersionAnswer> XML tags. Output formatted text, with line breaks for each question.Separate quotes and answers with a blank line. Provide the answers to all questions in English. After completing the English answers, translate all those answers into Chinese and provide the Chinese version inside <ChineseVersionAnswer></ChineseVersionAnswer> XML tags.

Thus, the format of your overall response should look like what's shown between the <example></example> tags.  Make sure to follow the formatting and spacing exactly.
