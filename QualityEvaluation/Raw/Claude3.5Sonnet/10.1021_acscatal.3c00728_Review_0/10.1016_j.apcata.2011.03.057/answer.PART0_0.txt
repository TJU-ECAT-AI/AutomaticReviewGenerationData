[1] "The demand for propylene world-wide is growing faster than ethylene, which causes a shortfall of propylene supply from steam cracking. As a result, propane dehydrogenation has been considered to address the propylene shortfall."

</quotes>

<EnglishVersionAnswer>

Propylene demand is outpacing ethylene demand globally, creating a supply shortage from traditional steam cracking methods. This has led to increased interest in propane dehydrogenation as an alternative production method to meet the growing propylene demand. The literature does not provide specific details on the economic or environmental advantages of propane dehydrogenation, nor does it elaborate on propylene's applications or significance in the chemical industry beyond mentioning its increasing demand relative to ethylene.
