<quotes>

[1] "The demand for propylene world-wide is growing faster than ethylene, which causes a shortfall of propylene supply from steam cracking. As a result, propane dehydrogenation has been considered to address the propylene shortfall."

</quotes>

<EnglishVersionAnswer>

Propylene demand is outpacing ethylene demand globally, creating a supply shortage from traditional steam cracking methods. This has led to increased interest in propane dehydrogenation as an alternative production method to meet the growing propylene demand. The literature does not provide specific details on the economic or environmental advantages of propane dehydrogenation, nor does it elaborate on propylene's applications or significance in the chemical industry beyond mentioning its increasing demand relative to ethylene.

</quotes>

<EnglishVersionAnswer>

The significance of propene in the chemical industry has grown due to its demand increasing faster than that of ethylene. This has led to a supply shortfall from traditional steam cracking methods. To address this shortfall, propane dehydrogenation has emerged as a preferred production method. This approach offers advantages in meeting the growing needs for propene across various applications by providing a dedicated production route. While the document does not explicitly state the economic and environmental advantages, propane dehydrogenation likely offers benefits such as improved efficiency and potentially reduced environmental impact compared to steam cracking.

</quotes>

<EnglishVersionAnswer>

Propylene demand is growing faster than ethylene demand globally, creating a supply shortfall from traditional steam cracking methods. To address this shortfall, propane dehydrogenation has emerged as an important alternative production method. This shift is driven by the need to meet increasing propylene demand independently of ethylene production. While the literature does not explicitly state the economic and environmental advantages, propane dehydrogenation likely offers benefits such as more targeted production of propylene and potentially reduced energy usage or emissions compared to steam cracking. The growing adoption of this method indicates its effectiveness in addressing the propylene supply gap across various industrial applications.

</quotes>

<EnglishVersionAnswer>

Propene's significance in the chemical industry has grown due to increasing global demand outpacing that of ethylene. This has led to a supply shortfall from traditional steam cracking methods. To address this gap, propane dehydrogenation has emerged as a preferred production method. While the literature does not explicitly state the economic and environmental advantages, it implies that propane dehydrogenation offers a more targeted approach to meeting propylene demand compared to steam cracking, which produces both ethylene and propylene. This method likely allows for more efficient use of resources and potentially reduced environmental impact by focusing solely on propylene production.
