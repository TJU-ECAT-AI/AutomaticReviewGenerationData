          "The demand for propylene world-wide is growing faster than ethylene, which causes a shortfall of propylene supply from steam cracking. As a result, propane dehydrogenation has been considered to address the propylene shortfall."

          Propene's significance in the chemical industry has evolved due to its demand growing faster than ethylene globally. This increasing demand has led to a supply shortfall from traditional steam cracking methods. To address this gap, propane dehydrogenation has emerged as a preferred production method. While the literature does not explicitly state the economic and environmental advantages, it implies that propane dehydrogenation offers a more targeted approach to meeting propylene demand compared to steam cracking, which produces both ethylene and propylene. This method likely allows for more efficient use of resources and potentially reduced environmental impact by focusing solely on propylene production. The growing adoption of this method indicates its effectiveness in addressing the propylene supply gap across various industrial applications. However, the literature does not provide specific details on the economic or environmental advantages of propane dehydrogenation, nor does it elaborate on propylene's applications or significance in the chemical industry beyond mentioning its increasing demand relative to ethylene.
