The significance of propene in the chemical industry has grown due to its demand increasing faster than that of ethylene. This has led to a supply shortfall from traditional steam cracking methods. To address this shortfall, propane dehydrogenation has emerged as a preferred production method. This approach offers advantages in meeting the growing needs for propene across various applications by providing a dedicated production route. While the document does not explicitly state the economic and environmental advantages, propane dehydrogenation likely offers benefits such as improved efficiency and potentially reduced environmental impact compared to steam cracking.
