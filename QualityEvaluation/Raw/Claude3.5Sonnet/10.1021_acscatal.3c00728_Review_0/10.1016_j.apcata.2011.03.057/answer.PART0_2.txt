[1] "The demand for propylene world-wide is growing faster than ethylene, which causes a shortfall of propylene supply from steam cracking. As a result, propane dehydrogenation has been considered to address the propylene shortfall."

Propylene demand is growing faster than ethylene demand globally, creating a supply shortfall from traditional steam cracking methods. To address this shortfall, propane dehydrogenation has emerged as an important alternative production method. This shift is driven by the need to meet increasing propylene demand independently of ethylene production. While the literature does not explicitly state the economic and environmental advantages, propane dehydrogenation likely offers benefits such as more targeted production of propylene and potentially reduced energy usage or emissions compared to steam cracking. The growing adoption of this method indicates its effectiveness in addressing the propylene supply gap across various industrial applications.

全球丙烯需求的增长速度快于乙烯,这导致传统蒸汽裂解方法无法满足供应需求。为了解决这一短缺问题,丙烷脱氢已成为一种重要的替代生产方法。这一转变是由于需要独立于乙烯生产来满足不断增长的丙烯需求。虽然文献中没有明确说明经济和环境优势,但丙烷脱氢可能在以下方面提供好处:更有针对性地生产丙烯,以及与蒸汽裂解相比可能减少能源使用或排放。这种方法的日益普及表明它在满足各种工业应用中丙烯供应缺口方面的有效性。
