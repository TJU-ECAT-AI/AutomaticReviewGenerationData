Propene's significance in the chemical industry has evolved due to its demand growing faster than ethylene. This increasing demand has led to a shortfall in propylene supply from traditional steam cracking methods. As a result, propane dehydrogenation has emerged as a preferred production method to address this shortfall.

The literature does not provide specific information about the economic and environmental advantages of propane dehydrogenation or details about propene's various applications. To fully answer the question, more information would be needed from other sources.

在化工行业中，丙烯的重要性不断演变，其需求增长速度超过了乙烯。这种不断增长的需求导致了传统蒸汽裂解方法无法满足丙烯供应。因此，丙烷脱氢已成为一种首选的生产方法，以解决这一供应短缺问题。

文献中没有提供关于丙烷脱氢的经济和环境优势，或丙烯在各种应用中的详细信息。要全面回答这个问题，需要从其他来源获取更多信息。
