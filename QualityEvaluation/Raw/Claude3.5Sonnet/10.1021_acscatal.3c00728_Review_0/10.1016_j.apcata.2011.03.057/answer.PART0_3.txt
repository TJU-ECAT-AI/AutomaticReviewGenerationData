[1] "The demand for propylene world-wide is growing faster than ethylene, which causes a shortfall of propylene supply from steam cracking. As a result, propane dehydrogenation has been considered to address the propylene shortfall."

Propene's significance in the chemical industry has grown due to increasing global demand outpacing that of ethylene. This has led to a supply shortfall from traditional steam cracking methods. To address this gap, propane dehydrogenation has emerged as a preferred production method. While the literature does not explicitly state the economic and environmental advantages, it implies that propane dehydrogenation offers a more targeted approach to meeting propylene demand compared to steam cracking, which produces both ethylene and propylene. This method likely allows for more efficient use of resources and potentially reduced environmental impact by focusing solely on propylene production.

丙烯在化工行业的重要性日益增长，其全球需求增长速度超过了乙烯。这导致了传统蒸汽裂解方法的供应短缺。为了解决这一缺口，丙烷脱氢已成为首选的生产方法。虽然文献没有明确说明经济和环境优势，但它暗示了与产生乙烯和丙烯的蒸汽裂解相比，丙烷脱氢提供了一种更有针对性的方法来满足丙烯需求。这种方法可能允许更有效地利用资源，并通过专注于丙烯生产而潜在地减少环境影响。
