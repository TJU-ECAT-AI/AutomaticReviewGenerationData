[1] "The demand for olefins, especially ethylene and propylene, is expected to increase significantly in the near future."

[2] "At the present time, the main sources of olefins are: steam cracking, fluid-catalytic-cracking, and catalytic dehydrogenation."

[3] "In steam cracking, ethylene is the preferred product, but the demand for propylene is growing faster than that for ethylene, especially in Western Europe"

[4] "Also, in the case of FCC, smaller amounts of propylene are produced. Therefore, the current production of olefins is not in line with the forecast market demand for olefins."

[5] "Dehydrogenation's thermodynamic constraints limit alkane conversion; furthermore, a major problem is coking, which causes rapid catalyst deactivation."

The significance of propene in the chemical industry has grown considerably, with its demand increasing faster than that of ethylene, particularly in Western Europe. This rising demand is driving the adoption of propane dehydrogenation as a preferred production method because traditional sources like steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) are not producing sufficient quantities of propylene to meet market needs.

Propane dehydrogenation offers several economic and environmental advantages in meeting the growing needs for this versatile olefin:

1. Targeted production: Unlike steam cracking, which primarily produces ethylene, propane dehydrogenation specifically targets propylene production, allowing for better alignment with market demand.

2. Feedstock flexibility: It allows the use of propane as a feedstock, which can be advantageous in regions with abundant natural gas liquids.

3. Energy efficiency: Compared to steam cracking, propane dehydrogenation is generally more energy-efficient, as it doesn't require the high temperatures needed for cracking larger hydrocarbons.

4. Reduced CO2 emissions: The process typically results in lower CO2 emissions compared to steam cracking, contributing to a reduced environmental footprint.

5. Improved yield: Propane dehydrogenation can offer higher propylene yields compared to FCC, which produces relatively small amounts of propylene.

However, it's important to note that propane dehydrogenation also faces challenges, such as thermodynamic constraints limiting alkane conversion and coking issues leading to catalyst deactivation. These factors drive ongoing research into catalysts and process improvements to enhance the economic and environmental benefits of this production method.

丙烯在化工行业的重要性已显著增长，其需求增长速度超过乙烯，特别是在西欧地区。这种不断增长的需求正在推动丙烷脱氢成为首选的生产方法，因为蒸汽裂解和流化催化裂化(FCC)等传统来源无法生产足够数量的丙烯来满足市场需求。

丙烷脱氢在满足这种多用途烯烃不断增长的需求方面提供了几个经济和环境优势：

1. 定向生产：与主要生产乙烯的蒸汽裂解不同，丙烷脱氢专门针对丙烯生产，能更好地满足市场需求。

2. 原料灵活性：它允许使用丙烷作为原料，这在天然气液体丰富的地区可能具有优势。

3. 能源效率：与蒸汽裂解相比，丙烷脱氢通常更加节能，因为它不需要裂解较大烃类所需的高温。

4. 减少二氧化碳排放：与蒸汽裂解相比，该过程通常导致较低的二氧化碳排放，有助于减少环境足迹。

5. 提高产率：与产生相对少量丙烯的FCC相比，丙烷脱氢可以提供更高的丙烯产率。

然而，需要注意的是，丙烷脱氢也面临挑战，如热力学限制烷烃转化和积碳问题导致催化剂失活。这些因素推动了对催化剂和工艺改进的持续研究，以增强这种生产方法的经济和环境效益。
