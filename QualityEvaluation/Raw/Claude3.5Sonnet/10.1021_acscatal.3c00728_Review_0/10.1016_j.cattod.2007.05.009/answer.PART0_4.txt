[1] "In steam cracking, ethylene is the preferred product, but the demand for propylene is growing faster than that for ethylene, especially in Western Europe"

[2] "Therefore, the need exists for new technologies devoted to the production of specific olefins, which have none of the disadvantages characterizing dehydrogenation."

[3] "Dehydrogenation's thermodynamic constraints limit alkane conversion; furthermore, a major problem is coking, which causes rapid catalyst deactivation."

Propene's significance in the chemical industry has grown as its demand is increasing faster than that of ethylene, particularly in Western Europe. This trend is driving the adoption of propane dehydrogenation as a preferred production method. The economic advantages of this approach include overcoming the limitations of traditional steam cracking, which favors ethylene production. Environmentally, propane dehydrogenation addresses the issue of coking that plagues conventional dehydrogenation processes, reducing catalyst deactivation and potentially improving overall efficiency. This method also allows for more targeted production of propylene to meet specific market demands across various applications, offering greater flexibility in olefin production compared to steam cracking.
