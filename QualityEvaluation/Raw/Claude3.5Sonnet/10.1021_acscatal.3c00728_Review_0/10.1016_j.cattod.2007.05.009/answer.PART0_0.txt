[1] "In steam cracking, ethylene is the preferred product, but the demand for propylene is growing faster than that for ethylene, especially in Western Europe"

[2] "Therefore, the need exists for new technologies devoted to the production of specific olefins, which have none of the disadvantages characterizing dehydrogenation."

[3] "Dehydrogenation's thermodynamic constraints limit alkane conversion; furthermore, a major problem is coking, which causes rapid catalyst deactivation."

Propene's significance in the chemical industry has evolved with its demand growing faster than that of ethylene, especially in Western Europe. This increasing demand is driving the adoption of propane dehydrogenation as a preferred production method because existing technologies like steam cracking produce more ethylene than propylene. Propane dehydrogenation offers economic and environmental advantages over traditional methods by allowing for more targeted production of propylene to meet growing needs across various applications. It avoids some of the disadvantages of conventional dehydrogenation, such as thermodynamic constraints limiting alkane conversion and coking issues causing catalyst deactivation. This approach enables more efficient and selective propylene production to satisfy increasing market demand for this versatile olefin.

丙烯在化工行业的重要性已经发生了变化，其需求增长速度快于乙烯，尤其是在西欧地区。这种不断增长的需求正在推动丙烷脱氢作为首选生产方法的采用，因为现有技术如蒸汽裂解生产的乙烯多于丙烯。与传统方法相比，丙烷脱氢在经济和环境方面具有优势，可以更有针对性地生产丙烯，以满足各种应用领域日益增长的需求。它避免了传统脱氢的一些缺点，如热力学限制导致烷烃转化受限以及积碳问题导致催化剂失活。这种方法能够更高效、更有选择性地生产丙烯，以满足市场对这种多功能烯烃不断增长的需求。
