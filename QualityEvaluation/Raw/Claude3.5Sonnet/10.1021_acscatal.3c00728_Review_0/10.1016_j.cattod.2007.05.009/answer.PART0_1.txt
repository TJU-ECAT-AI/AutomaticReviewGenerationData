[1] "In steam cracking, ethylene is the preferred product, but the demand for propylene is growing faster than that for ethylene, especially in Western Europe"

[2] "Therefore, the need exists for new technologies devoted to the production of specific olefins, which have none of the disadvantages characterizing dehydrogenation."

[3] "Dehydrogenation's thermodynamic constraints limit alkane conversion; furthermore, a major problem is coking, which causes rapid catalyst deactivation."

The significance of propene in the chemical industry has evolved due to its growing demand outpacing that of ethylene, particularly in Western Europe. This trend is driving the adoption of propane dehydrogenation as a preferred production method to meet the specific need for propylene. The economic advantages of this approach include the ability to produce propylene more selectively compared to traditional steam cracking, which favors ethylene production. Environmental benefits stem from avoiding the disadvantages of conventional dehydrogenation, such as thermodynamic limitations on conversion and rapid catalyst deactivation due to coking. By offering a more targeted and efficient route to propylene, propane dehydrogenation helps meet the growing needs for this versatile olefin across various applications while potentially reducing energy consumption and catalyst waste.

在化工行业中,丙烯的重要性不断提升,其需求增长速度超过了乙烯,尤其是在西欧地区。这一趋势推动了丙烷脱氢作为首选生产方法的采用,以满足对丙烯的特定需求。这种方法的经济优势包括能够比传统的蒸汽裂解更有选择性地生产丙烯,而蒸汽裂解更倾向于生产乙烯。环境效益来自于避免了传统脱氢方法的缺点,如转化率的热力学限制和由于结焦导致的催化剂快速失活。通过提供一种更有针对性和更高效的丙烯生产途径,丙烷脱氢有助于满足这种多用途烯烃在各种应用中日益增长的需求,同时可能减少能源消耗和催化剂浪费。
