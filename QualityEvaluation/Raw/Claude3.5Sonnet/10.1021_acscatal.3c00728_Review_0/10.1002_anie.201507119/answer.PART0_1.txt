The literature does not provide comprehensive information about the evolution of propene's significance in the chemical industry or its increasing demand. However, it does mention that propane dehydrogenation (DHP) is becoming a preferred production method for propylene due to its economic and environmental advantages.

DHP is described as more economical and environmentally friendly compared to traditional methods like thermal or catalytic cracking of naphtha. The main advantages of DHP are:

1. Lower energy requirements: Traditional methods require large amounts of energy, while DHP is presumably more energy-efficient.

2. Reduced CO2 emissions: The conventional naphtha cracking process generates enormous CO2 emissions, whereas DHP likely produces less greenhouse gas emissions.

3. Utilization of propane feedstock: DHP allows for the direct conversion of propane to propylene, potentially offering a more efficient use of resources.

While the text doesn't explicitly discuss the growing needs for propylene across various applications, the emphasis on developing improved catalysts for DHP suggests that there is indeed an increasing demand for this versatile olefin in the chemical industry.

文献并未提供关于丙烯在化工行业中重要性演变或其需求增长的全面信息。然而，它确实提到由于经济和环境优势，丙烷脱氢(DHP)正成为生产丙烯的首选方法。

DHP被描述为比传统的石脑油热裂解或催化裂解方法更经济、更环保。DHP的主要优势包括：

1. 能源需求更低：传统方法需要大量能源，而DHP推测能源效率更高。

2. 减少二氧化碳排放：传统的石脑油裂解过程产生大量二氧化碳排放，而DHP可能产生较少的温室气体排放。

3. 利用丙烷原料：DHP允许直接将丙烷转化为丙烯，可能提供更有效的资源利用。

虽然文本没有明确讨论丙烯在各种应用中的需求增长，但对改进DHP催化剂的强调表明，化工行业对这种多用途烯烃的需求确实在增加。
