[1] "The dehydrogenation of propane (DHP) to propylene represents an economical and environmentally friendly route compared to the traditional thermal or catalytic cracking of crude-oil-derived naphtha, which requires large amounts of energy and generates enormous CO2 emissions."

<EnglishVersionAnswer>

The literature does not provide comprehensive information about propene's evolving significance in the chemical industry or its increasing demand. However, it does mention that propane dehydrogenation (DHP) is becoming a preferred production method for propylene due to economic and environmental advantages.

DHP is described as more economical and environmentally friendly compared to traditional methods like thermal or catalytic cracking of crude-oil-derived naphtha. The main advantages of DHP are:

1. Lower energy requirements
2. Reduced CO2 emissions

These benefits make DHP an attractive alternative for meeting the growing demand for propylene, although the specific applications and extent of demand increase are not detailed in the given literature.

The adoption of DHP appears to be driven by the need for more sustainable and cost-effective production methods in the chemical industry, particularly as environmental concerns become more prominent. However, the text does not provide specific information about propene's various applications or quantify its growing demand across different sectors.

文献并未提供关于丙烯在化学工业中日益重要性或其需求增长的全面信息。然而，它确实提到由于经济和环境优势，丙烷脱氢(DHP)正成为生产丙烯的首选方法。

DHP被描述为比传统方法（如原油衍生石脑油的热裂解或催化裂解）更经济和环保。DHP的主要优势是：

1. 能源需求更低
2. 减少二氧化碳排放

这些优势使DHP成为满足丙烯不断增长需求的有吸引力的替代方案，尽管给定的文献中没有详细说明具体应用和需求增长的程度。

采用DHP似乎是由化学工业对更可持续和具有成本效益的生产方法的需求所驱动，特别是当环境问题变得更加突出时。然而，文本并未提供有关丙烯各种应用的具体信息，也未量化其在不同行业的需求增长。
