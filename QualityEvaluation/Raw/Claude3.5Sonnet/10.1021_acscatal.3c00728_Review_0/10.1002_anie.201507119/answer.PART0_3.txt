The literature does not provide detailed information about the evolution of propene's significance in the chemical industry or its increasing demand. However, it does mention that propane dehydrogenation (DHP) is becoming a preferred production method for propylene due to its economic and environmental advantages.

DHP is considered more economical and environmentally friendly compared to traditional methods like thermal or catalytic cracking of crude-oil-derived naphtha. The main advantages of DHP include:

1. Lower energy requirements: Traditional methods require large amounts of energy, while DHP is presumably more energy-efficient.

2. Reduced CO2 emissions: Conventional processes generate enormous CO2 emissions, whereas DHP likely produces fewer greenhouse gases.

3. Direct conversion: DHP allows for the direct conversion of propane to propylene, potentially simplifying the production process.

These advantages make DHP an attractive option for meeting the growing demand for propylene in various applications, although the specific applications are not mentioned in the given text.

文献没有提供关于丙烯在化学工业中重要性演变或其需求增加的详细信息。然而，它确实提到了由于经济和环境优势，丙烷脱氢(DHP)正成为生产丙烯的首选方法。

与传统的原油衍生石脑油热裂解或催化裂解相比，DHP被认为更经济、更环保。DHP的主要优势包括：

1. 更低的能源需求：传统方法需要大量能源，而DHP推测更加节能。

2. 减少二氧化碳排放：常规工艺产生大量二氧化碳排放，而DHP可能产生较少的温室气体。

3. 直接转化：DHP允许丙烷直接转化为丙烯，可能简化了生产过程。

这些优势使DHP成为满足各种应用中不断增长的丙烯需求的有吸引力的选择，尽管给定文本中没有提到具体的应用。
