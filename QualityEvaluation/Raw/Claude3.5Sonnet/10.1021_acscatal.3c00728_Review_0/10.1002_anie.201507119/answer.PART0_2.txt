The literature does not provide comprehensive information about the evolution of propene's significance in the chemical industry or its increasing demand. However, it does mention that propane dehydrogenation (DHP) has become a preferred production method for propylene due to its economic and environmental advantages.

DHP is described as more economical and environmentally friendly compared to traditional methods like thermal or catalytic cracking of crude-oil-derived naphtha. The main advantages of DHP are:

1. Lower energy requirements: Traditional methods require large amounts of energy, while DHP is presumably more energy-efficient.

2. Reduced CO2 emissions: Conventional processes generate enormous CO2 emissions, whereas DHP likely produces less greenhouse gas.

These benefits make DHP an attractive option for meeting the growing demand for propylene in various applications, although the specific applications are not detailed in the given text. The adoption of DHP as a preferred production method suggests that the chemical industry is moving towards more sustainable and cost-effective processes to produce this versatile olefin.

该文献没有提供关于丙烯在化工行业中重要性演变或其需求增长的全面信息。但是，它确实提到了丙烷脱氢(DHP)由于其经济和环境优势已成为生产丙烯的首选方法。

DHP被描述为比传统方法（如原油衍生的石脑油的热裂解或催化裂解）更经济和环保。DHP的主要优势是：

1. 较低的能源需求：传统方法需要大量能源，而DHP可能更加节能。

2. 减少CO2排放：传统工艺产生大量CO2排放，而DHP可能产生较少的温室气体。

这些优势使DHP成为满足各种应用中丙烯日益增长需求的有吸引力的选择，尽管给定文本中没有详细说明具体应用。采用DHP作为首选生产方法表明，化工行业正在向更可持续和具有成本效益的工艺发展，以生产这种用途广泛的烯烃。
