The literature does not provide comprehensive information about the evolution of propene's significance in the chemical industry or its increasing demand. However, it does mention that propane dehydrogenation (DHP) is becoming a preferred production method for propylene due to its economic and environmental advantages.

DHP is described as more economical and environmentally friendly compared to traditional methods like thermal or catalytic cracking of crude-oil-derived naphtha. The main advantages of DHP are:

1. Lower energy requirements: Traditional methods require large amounts of energy, while DHP is implied to be more energy-efficient.

2. Reduced CO2 emissions: Conventional processes generate enormous CO2 emissions, whereas DHP is presented as a more environmentally friendly alternative.

3. Direct conversion: DHP allows for the direct conversion of propane to propylene, potentially simplifying the production process.

While the text doesn't explicitly discuss the growing needs for propylene across various applications, the emphasis on developing more efficient catalysts for DHP suggests an increasing demand for this versatile olefin in the chemical industry.

文献并未提供关于丙烯在化学工业中重要性演变或其需求增长的全面信息。但是，它确实提到丙烷脱氢（DHP）正成为丙烯生产的首选方法，这是由于其经济和环境方面的优势。

DHP被描述为比传统方法（如原油衍生石脑油的热裂解或催化裂解）更经济、更环保。DHP的主要优势包括：

1. 较低的能源需求：传统方法需要大量能源，而DHP被暗示为更加节能。

2. 减少CO2排放：常规工艺会产生大量CO2排放，而DHP被视为更环保的替代方案。

3. 直接转化：DHP允许丙烷直接转化为丙烯，可能简化了生产过程。

虽然文本没有明确讨论丙烯在各种应用中不断增长的需求，但对开发更高效DHP催化剂的强调表明，化学工业对这种多用途烯烃的需求正在增加。
