[1] "The dehydrogenation of propane (DHP) to propylene represents an economical and environmentally friendly route compared to the traditional thermal or catalytic cracking of crude-oil-derived naphtha, which requires large amounts of energy and generates enormous CO2 emissions."
</quotes>

<EnglishVersionAnswer>

The literature does not provide comprehensive information about propene's evolving significance in the chemical industry or its increasing demand. However, it does mention that propane dehydrogenation (DHP) is becoming a preferred production method for propylene due to economic and environmental advantages.

DHP is described as more economical and environmentally friendly compared to traditional methods like thermal or catalytic cracking of crude-oil-derived naphtha. The main advantages of DHP are:

1. Lower energy requirements
2. Reduced CO2 emissions

These benefits make DHP an attractive alternative for meeting the growing demand for propylene, although the specific applications and extent of demand increase are not detailed in the given literature.

The adoption of DHP appears to be driven by the need for more sustainable and cost-effective production methods in the chemical industry, particularly as environmental concerns become more prominent. However, the text does not provide specific information about propene's various applications or quantify its growing demand across different sectors.

文献并未提供关于丙烯在化学工业中日益重要性或其需求增长的全面信息。然而，它确实提到由于经济和环境优势，丙烷脱氢(DHP)正成为生产丙烯的首选方法。

DHP被描述为比传统方法（如原油衍生石脑油的热裂解或催化裂解）更经济和环保。DHP的主要优势是：

1. 能源需求更低
2. 减少二氧化碳排放

这些优势使DHP成为满足丙烯不断增长需求的有吸引力的替代方案，尽管给定的文献中没有详细说明具体应用和需求增长的程度。

采用DHP似乎是由化学工业对更可持续和具有成本效益的生产方法的需求所驱动，特别是当环境问题变得更加突出时。然而，文本并未提供有关丙烯各种应用的具体信息，也未量化其在不同行业的需求增长。

The literature does not provide comprehensive information about the evolution of propene's significance in the chemical industry or its increasing demand. However, it does mention that propane dehydrogenation (DHP) is becoming a preferred production method for propylene due to its economic and environmental advantages.

DHP is described as more economical and environmentally friendly compared to traditional methods like thermal or catalytic cracking of naphtha. The main advantages of DHP are:

1. Lower energy requirements: Traditional methods require large amounts of energy, while DHP is presumably more energy-efficient.

2. Reduced CO2 emissions: The conventional naphtha cracking process generates enormous CO2 emissions, whereas DHP likely produces less greenhouse gas emissions.

3. Utilization of propane feedstock: DHP allows for the direct conversion of propane to propylene, potentially offering a more efficient use of resources.

While the text doesn't explicitly discuss the growing needs for propylene across various applications, the emphasis on developing improved catalysts for DHP suggests that there is indeed an increasing demand for this versatile olefin in the chemical industry.

文献并未提供关于丙烯在化工行业中重要性演变或其需求增长的全面信息。然而，它确实提到由于经济和环境优势，丙烷脱氢(DHP)正成为生产丙烯的首选方法。

DHP被描述为比传统的石脑油热裂解或催化裂解方法更经济、更环保。DHP的主要优势包括：

1. 能源需求更低：传统方法需要大量能源，而DHP推测能源效率更高。

2. 减少二氧化碳排放：传统的石脑油裂解过程产生大量二氧化碳排放，而DHP可能产生较少的温室气体排放。

3. 利用丙烷原料：DHP允许直接将丙烷转化为丙烯，可能提供更有效的资源利用。

虽然文本没有明确讨论丙烯在各种应用中的需求增长，但对改进DHP催化剂的强调表明，化工行业对这种多用途烯烃的需求确实在增加。

The literature does not provide detailed information about the evolution of propene's significance in the chemical industry or its increasing demand. However, it does mention that propane dehydrogenation (DHP) is becoming a preferred production method for propylene due to its economic and environmental advantages.

DHP is considered more economical and environmentally friendly compared to traditional methods like thermal or catalytic cracking of crude-oil-derived naphtha. The main advantages of DHP include:

1. Lower energy requirements: Traditional methods require large amounts of energy, while DHP is presumably more energy-efficient.

2. Reduced CO2 emissions: Conventional processes generate enormous CO2 emissions, whereas DHP likely produces fewer greenhouse gases.
