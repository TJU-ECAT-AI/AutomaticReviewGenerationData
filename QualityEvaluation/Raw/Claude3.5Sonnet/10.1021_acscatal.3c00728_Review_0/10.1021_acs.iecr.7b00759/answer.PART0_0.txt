Propylene has become increasingly important as a building block in the petrochemical industry, with diverse applications driving growing demand. While traditional production methods like steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking can meet global propylene needs, they have significant drawbacks including high energy requirements, coke formation, high costs, and low efficiency.

Oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of propane has emerged as an attractive alternative production method for several reasons:

1. It is exothermic, resulting in minimal energy demand compared to endothermic cracking processes.

2. It offers high product selectivity, minimizing waste and improving efficiency.

3. It produces water as a byproduct, avoiding thermodynamic limitations of cracking reactions.

4. It contributes minimal environmental pollution due to low energy use and high selectivity.

5. Propane feedstock is abundantly available from natural gas and refinery gases, making production potentially less expensive.

These economic and environmental advantages make propane ODH increasingly appealing as a method to meet growing propylene demand more sustainably and cost-effectively across its many industrial applications. The technology addresses key challenges of traditional production while leveraging widely available propane feedstock.

丙烯作为石油化工行业的重要基础原料，其应用范围广泛，需求不断增长。虽然传统的蒸汽裂解和流化催化裂解方法可以满足全球丙烯需求，但这些方法存在能耗高、焦炭形成多、成本高和效率低等显著缺点。

丙烷的氧化脱氢(ODH)作为一种有吸引力的替代生产方法，具有以下几个原因：

1. 它是放热反应，与吸热的裂解过程相比，能量需求最小。

2. 它提供了高产品选择性，最大限度地减少了废物并提高了效率。

3. 它生成水作为副产品，避免了裂解反应的热力学限制。

4. 由于低能耗和高选择性，它对环境污染的贡献最小。

5. 丙烷原料可从天然气和炼厂气中大量获得，使生产成本可能更低。

这些经济和环境优势使丙烷ODH成为一种越来越有吸引力的方法，可以更可持续和更具成本效益地满足丙烯在其众多工业应用中不断增长的需求。该技术解决了传统生产方法的关键挑战，同时利用了广泛可用的丙烷原料。
