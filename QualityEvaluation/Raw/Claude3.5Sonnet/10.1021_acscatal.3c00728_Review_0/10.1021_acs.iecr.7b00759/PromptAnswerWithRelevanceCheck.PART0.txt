Propylene has become increasingly important as a building block in the petrochemical industry, with diverse applications driving growing demand. While traditional production methods like steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking can meet global propylene needs, they have significant drawbacks including high energy requirements, coke formation, high costs, and low efficiency.

Oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of propane has emerged as an attractive alternative production method for several reasons:

1. It is exothermic, resulting in minimal energy demand compared to endothermic cracking processes.

2. It offers high product selectivity, minimizing waste and improving efficiency.

3. It produces water as a byproduct, avoiding thermodynamic limitations of cracking reactions.

4. It contributes minimal environmental pollution due to low energy use and high selectivity.

5. Propane feedstock is abundantly available from natural gas and refinery gases, making production potentially less expensive.

These economic and environmental advantages make propane ODH increasingly appealing as a method to meet growing propylene demand more sustainably and cost-effectively across its many industrial applications. The technology addresses key challenges of traditional production while leveraging widely available propane feedstock.
