[1] "Propylene is one of the most important building blocks in the petrochemical industry, having a wide range of applications."

[2] "Steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking of petroleum feedstocks are the other sources of propylene."

[3] "Although the catalytic cracking technologies are capable of meeting the worldwide propylene demand, they suffer with high energy requirement, considerable coke formation, high operating cost, and low efficiency."

[4] "In this regard, production of propylene via oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of propane is an attractive alternative due to the exothermic nature of the overall reactions, which results in minimal energy demand."

[5] "The ODH of propane also contributes minimum environmental pollution due to its low energy demand and high product selectivity."

Propylene's significance in the chemical industry has grown as it has become one of the most important building blocks in petrochemicals, with diverse applications. The increasing demand for propylene has driven the adoption of propane dehydrogenation as a preferred production method due to several factors:

1. Limitations of traditional methods: While steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking can meet global propylene demand, they have drawbacks including high energy requirements, coke formation, high operating costs, and low efficiency.

2. Energy efficiency: Oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of propane is an attractive alternative due to its exothermic nature, resulting in minimal energy demand compared to traditional methods.

3. Environmental benefits: The ODH process contributes to minimum environmental pollution because of its low energy demand and high product selectivity.

4. Economic advantages: The lower energy requirements and higher efficiency of propane dehydrogenation likely translate to reduced production costs compared to traditional methods.

5. Feedstock availability: The abundant availability of propane in natural gas and refinery gases makes propylene production via ODH potentially less expensive.

These factors combine to make propane dehydrogenation an increasingly attractive method for meeting the growing demand for propylene across its various applications in the petrochemical industry.

丙烯在化工行业的重要性日益增长，它已成为石油化工领域最重要的基础原料之一，应用广泛。丙烯需求的增加推动了丙烷脱氢作为首选生产方法的采用，原因如下：

1. 传统方法的局限性：虽然蒸汽裂解和流化催化裂解可以满足全球丙烯需求，但它们存在能耗高、结焦严重、运营成本高和效率低等缺点。

2. 能源效率：由于丙烷氧化脱氢（ODH）过程的放热性质，与传统方法相比，能量需求最小，因此是一种具有吸引力的替代方法。

3. 环境效益：ODH过程由于能量需求低和产品选择性高，对环境污染最小。

4. 经济优势：与传统方法相比，丙烷脱氢的较低能源需求和较高效率可能会转化为较低的生产成本。

5. 原料可用性：天然气和炼厂气中丙烷的大量存在，使得通过ODH生产丙烯的成本可能更低。

这些因素综合起来，使得丙烷脱氢成为一种越来越具有吸引力的方法，可以满足石油化工行业各种应用中不断增长的丙烯需求。
