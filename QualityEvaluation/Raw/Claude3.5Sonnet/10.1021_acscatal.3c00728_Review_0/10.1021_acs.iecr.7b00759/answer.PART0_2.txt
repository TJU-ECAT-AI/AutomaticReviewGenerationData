Propylene's significance in the chemical industry has grown substantially, as it is now recognized as one of the most important building blocks in the petrochemical sector with diverse applications. Initially produced as a byproduct of petroleum refining, the supply could not meet the increasing market demand.

While catalytic cracking technologies can meet global propylene demand, they have significant drawbacks including high energy requirements, coke formation, high operating costs, and low efficiency. These factors have driven the adoption of propane dehydrogenation, specifically oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH), as a preferred production method.

The economic advantages of propane ODH include minimal energy demand due to the exothermic nature of the reactions. This results in lower operating costs compared to traditional methods. Environmentally, ODH of propane contributes minimal pollution because of its low energy requirements and high product selectivity. These benefits make ODH an attractive alternative for meeting the growing needs for this versatile olefin across various applications in a more sustainable and cost-effective manner.

丙烯在化工行业的重要性已经显著提高，现在被认为是石油化工行业最重要的建筑基块之一，具有多样化的应用。最初作为石油炼制的副产品生产，其供应无法满足日益增长的市场需求。

虽然催化裂解技术能够满足全球丙烯需求，但它们存在严重缺点，包括高能耗、焦炭形成、高运营成本和低效率。这些因素推动了丙烷脱氢，特别是氧化脱氢（ODH）作为首选生产方法的采用。

丙烷ODH的经济优势包括由于反应的放热性质而导致的最小能源需求。与传统方法相比，这导致了较低的运营成本。从环境角度来看，由于其低能耗和高产品选择性，丙烷的ODH对污染的贡献最小。这些优势使ODH成为一种更具吸引力的替代方案，能以更可持续和更具成本效益的方式满足这种多用途烯烃在各种应用中不断增长的需求。
