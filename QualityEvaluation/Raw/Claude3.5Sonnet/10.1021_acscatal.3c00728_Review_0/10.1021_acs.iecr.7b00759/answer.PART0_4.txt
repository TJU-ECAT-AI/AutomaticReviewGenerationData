[1] "Propylene is one of the most important building blocks in the petrochemical industry, having a wide range of applications."

[2] "Although the catalytic cracking technologies are capable of meeting the worldwide propylene demand, they suffer with high energy requirement, considerable coke formation, high operating cost, and low efficiency."

[3] "In this regard, production of propylene via oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of propane is an attractive alternative due to the exothermic nature of the overall reactions, which results in minimal energy demand."

[4] "In addition, the abundant availability of propane in natural gas/refinery gases makes propylene production less expensive via the ODH route."

[5] "The ODH of propane also contributes minimum environmental pollution due to its low energy demand and high product selectivity."

Propene's significance in the chemical industry has grown due to its importance as a key building block with wide-ranging applications. The increasing demand for propene has driven the adoption of propane dehydrogenation as a preferred production method for several reasons:

1. Traditional catalytic cracking methods, while capable of meeting demand, have drawbacks including high energy requirements, coke formation, high costs, and low efficiency.

2. Oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of propane offers advantages as an alternative production method:

- It is exothermic, resulting in minimal energy demand.
- Propane feedstock is abundantly available in natural gas and refinery gases, making production less expensive.
- The process contributes minimal environmental pollution due to low energy use and high product selectivity.

These economic and environmental advantages make propane dehydrogenation via ODH an attractive method for meeting the growing needs for propene across various industrial applications. The approach addresses issues with traditional methods while providing a more sustainable and cost-effective production route for this versatile olefin.

由于丙烯作为一种关键的建筑模块在各种应用中的重要性，其在化学工业中的重要性不断增长。丙烯需求的增加推动了丙烷脱氢作为首选生产方法的采用，原因如下：

1. 传统的催化裂解方法虽然能够满足需求，但存在缺点，包括高能耗、焦炭形成、高成本和低效率。

2. 丙烷的氧化脱氢（ODH）作为替代生产方法提供了以下优势：

- 它是放热的，导致能量需求最小。
- 丙烷原料在天然气和炼厂气中丰富可得，使生产成本更低。
- 由于能源使用低和产品选择性高，该过程对环境污染最小。

这些经济和环境优势使丙烷脱氢通过ODH成为满足各种工业应用中丙烯不断增长需求的一种有吸引力的方法。这种方法解决了传统方法的问题，同时为这种多功能烯烃提供了更可持续和更具成本效益的生产途径。
