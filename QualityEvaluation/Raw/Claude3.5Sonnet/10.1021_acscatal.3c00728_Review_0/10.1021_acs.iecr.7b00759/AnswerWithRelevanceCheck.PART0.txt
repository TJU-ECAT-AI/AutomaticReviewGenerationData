          [1] "Propylene is one of the most important building blocks in the petrochemical industry, having a wide range of applications."
          
          [2] "It was first produced as a byproduct of petroleum refining, which could not meet the market demand for propylene."
          
          [3] "Although the catalytic cracking technologies are capable of meeting the worldwide propylene demand, they suffer with high energy requirement, considerable coke formation, high operating cost, and low efficiency."
          
          [4] "In this regard, production of propylene via oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of propane is an attractive alternative due to the exothermic nature of the overall reactions, which results in minimal energy demand."
          
          [5] "The ODH of propane also contributes minimum environmental pollution due to its low energy demand and high product selectivity."
          
          [6] "Another important advantage of ODH of propane is the availability of water as a product, which helps to avoid thermodynamics limitations as observed during catalytic cracking reactions."
          
          [7] "In addition, the abundant availability of propane in natural gas/refinery gases makes propylene production less expensive via the ODH route."

          Propylene's significance in the chemical industry has evolved significantly. Initially produced as a byproduct of petroleum refining, it has become one of the most important building blocks in the petrochemical industry with a wide range of applications. The increasing demand for propylene has driven the adoption of propane dehydrogenation, specifically oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH), as a preferred production method due to several factors:

          1. Limitations of traditional methods: While catalytic cracking technologies can meet global propylene demand, they have drawbacks including high energy requirements, coke formation, high operating costs, and low efficiency.

          2. Energy efficiency: ODH of propane is an attractive alternative due to its exothermic nature, resulting in minimal energy demand compared to traditional methods.

          3. Environmental benefits: The ODH process contributes to minimum environmental pollution because of its low energy demand and high product selectivity.

          4. Economic advantages: Lower energy requirements, higher efficiency, and the abundant availability of propane in natural gas and refinery gases make propylene production potentially less expensive via the ODH route.

          5. Process advantages: The production of water as a byproduct helps avoid thermodynamic limitations observed in catalytic cracking reactions.

          These economic and environmental advantages make propane dehydrogenation via ODH an increasingly attractive method for meeting the growing needs for this versatile olefin across various industrial applications in a more sustainable and cost-effective manner.

          丙烯在化工行业的重要性已经发生了显著的演变。最初作为石油炼制的副产品生产，它已成为石油化工行业最重要的基础原料之一，应用广泛。丙烯需求的增加推动了丙烷脱氢，特别是氧化脱氢（ODH）作为首选生产方法的采用，原因如下：

          1. 传统方法的局限性：虽然催化裂解技术可以满足全球丙烯需求，但它们存在能耗高、结焦严重、运营成本高和效率低等缺点。

          2. 能源效率：由于丙烷ODH过程的放热性质，与传统方法相比，能量需求最小，因此是一种具有吸引力的替代方法。

          3. 环境效益：ODH过程由于能量需求低和产品选择性高，对环境污染最小。

          4. 经济优势：较低的能源需求、较高的效率，以及天然气和炼厂气中丙烷的大量存在，使得通过ODH路线生产丙烯的成本可能更低。

          5. 工艺优势：水作为副产品的生成有助于避免在催化裂解反应中观察到的热力学限制。

          这些经济和环境优势使得通过ODH进行的丙烷脱氢成为一种越来越具有吸引力的方法，可以以更可持续和更具成本效益的方式满足这种多用途烯烃在各种工业应用中不断增长的需求。
