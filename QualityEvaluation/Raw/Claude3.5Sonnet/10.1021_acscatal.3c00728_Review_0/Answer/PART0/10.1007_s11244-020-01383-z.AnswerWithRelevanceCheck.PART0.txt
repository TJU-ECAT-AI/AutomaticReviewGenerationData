          [1] "As ethane cracking only produces sparing amounts of olefins heavier than ethylene [1], a gap between the supply of propylene from crackers and the demand for propylene has emerged [2]."

          [2] "To fill this gap, so-called on-purpose propylene production processes have been implemented such as propane dehydrogenation (PDH) which benefits from high propylene selectivity from catalysts that are typically platinum- or chromium-based [3]."

          [3] "However, these processes also have significant disadvantages. PDH is highly endothermic and equilibrium-limited owing to the coproduction of H2, thus high reaction temperatures are required to drive conversion. Additionally, PDH catalysts deactivate rapidly due to the deposition of carbon (coke) on the surface and capital-intensive reactor designs allowing for semi-continuous catalyst regeneration have been engineered to work around this caveat."

          Propene's significance in the chemical industry has evolved due to a growing gap between supply from traditional cracking processes and increasing demand. Ethane cracking, which has become more prevalent due to the abundance of natural gas, produces very little propylene compared to naphtha cracking. This supply-demand imbalance has driven the adoption of on-purpose propylene production methods, particularly propane dehydrogenation (PDH).

          PDH has become a preferred production method due to its high propylene selectivity using platinum- or chromium-based catalysts. However, it comes with certain disadvantages:
          1. It is highly endothermic, requiring high reaction temperatures, which increases energy costs.
          2. The process is equilibrium-limited due to hydrogen co-production.
          3. PDH catalysts deactivate quickly from carbon deposition, necessitating expensive reactor designs for frequent catalyst regeneration.

          While the economic advantages of PDH in meeting growing propylene needs are not explicitly stated, it can be inferred that PDH's ability to produce propylene selectively helps address the supply-demand gap more effectively than traditional cracking methods. However, the high temperatures and frequent catalyst regeneration required add to operating costs.

          The literature does not provide specific information on the environmental advantages of PDH or the various applications driving propylene demand growth. More context would be needed to fully address these aspects of the question.

          丙烯在化工行业的重要性已经发生了变化，这是由于传统裂解工艺的供应与日益增长的需求之间出现了差距。由于天然气的丰富，乙烷裂解变得更加普遍，但与石脑油裂解相比，它产生的丙烯量很少。这种供需不平衡推动了定向丙烯生产方法的采用，特别是丙烷脱氢（PDH）。

          PDH之所以成为首选的生产方法，是因为它使用铂基或铬基催化剂可以提供高丙烯选择性。然而，它也有一些缺点：
          1. 它是高度吸热的，需要高反应温度，这增加了能源成本。
          2. 由于副产氢气，该过程受到平衡限制。
          3. PDH催化剂由于碳沉积而迅速失活，需要昂贵的反应器设计以进行频繁的催化剂再生。

          虽然文中没有明确说明PDH在满足不断增长的丙烯需求方面的经济优势，但可以推断，与传统裂解方法相比，PDH选择性生产丙烯的能力有助于更有效地解决供需差距。然而，所需的高温和频繁的催化剂再生会增加运营成本。

          文献中没有提供PDH的环境优势或推动丙烯需求增长的各种应用的具体信息。需要更多背景信息才能全面回答这些问题的方面。
