          [1] "Propylene is one of the important feedstocks in the chemical industry to produce different valuable products. Approximately two thirds of the propylene produced worldwide is consumed in the production of thermoplastic polypropylene, a commonly used compound in the fabrication of household appliances, plastic films and many other applications. The present worldwide propylene sales/demand reaches over ninety billion dollars."

[2] "Contrary to the above discussed commercial processes, the oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of propane to propylene is more attractive due to its low operational cost and minimal environmental impacts. The abundant availability of propane in natural gas and refinery off gases can make the propylene production by ODH propane even more sustainable compared to the conventional processes."

          Propene's significance in the chemical industry has evolved substantially, with global demand now exceeding $90 billion. It is a crucial feedstock for various valuable products, with about two-thirds of worldwide production going into thermoplastic polypropylene, used in household appliances, plastic films, and many other applications.

The increasing demand for propene is driving the adoption of propane dehydrogenation, particularly oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH), as a preferred production method. This approach offers several economic and environmental advantages in meeting the growing needs for this versatile olefin:

1. Lower operational costs compared to conventional processes.
2. Minimal environmental impacts.
3. Increased sustainability due to the abundant availability of propane in natural gas and refinery off gases.
4. Potential to meet the rising global demand more efficiently.

These factors make propane dehydrogenation, especially ODH, an attractive alternative to traditional propene production methods, aligning with both economic and environmental considerations in the chemical industry. It offers a more efficient and sustainable way to meet the increasing needs for this versatile olefin across various applications, while also aligning with sustainability goals in the chemical industry.

          丙烯在化学工业中的重要性已大幅提升，全球需求现已超过900亿美元。它是多种有价值产品的关键原料，全球约三分之二的产量用于生产热塑性聚丙烯，应用于家用电器、塑料薄膜和许多其他领域。

丙烯需求的增长正推动丙烷脱氢法，特别是氧化脱氢法(ODH)，成为首选的生产方法。这种方法在满足这种多用途烯烃日益增长的需求方面具有多项经济和环境优势：

1. 与传统工艺相比，运营成本更低。
2. 对环境的影响最小。
3. 由于天然气和炼油厂尾气中丙烷资源丰富，可提高可持续性。
4. 有潜力更有效地满足不断增长的全球需求。

这些因素使得丙烷脱氢法，尤其是ODH，成为传统丙烯生产方法的有吸引力的替代方案，符合化学工业的经济和环境考虑。它提供了一种更高效、更可持续的方式来满足这种多功能烯烃在各种应用中日益增长的需求，同时也符合化工行业的可持续发展目标。
