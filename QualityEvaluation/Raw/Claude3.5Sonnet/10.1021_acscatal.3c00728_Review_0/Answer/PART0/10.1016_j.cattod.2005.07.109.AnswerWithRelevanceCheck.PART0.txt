          [1] "Propylene is the key building block for the production of important petrochemicals, such as polypropylene, acrylonitrile, propylene oxide, cumene, phenol, isopropylic alcohol and many others"

[2] "As shown in Fig. 1, propylene worldwide demand has been increasing at an annual average of 5.7% since 1990; by year 2000, propylene production was about 52 million tonnes, and it is projected that by year 2010, demand will grow to 84 million tonnes, due to the increasing polypropylene demand"

[3] "Currently, about 70% of propylene worldwide production comes from steam crackers, 28% from refinery fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) units and 2% from specific on-purpose processes, such as propane dehydrogenation, metathesis and others."

[4] "It is expected that in order to cover the future demand, the propylene market share from other processes than steam cracking will importantly grow, since it is forecast that propylene market will grow faster than ethylene market"

[5] "Although capacity of propylene on-purpose processes is going to be quadrupled in the next 5 years, it will still cover only a small part of the propylene demand, and other sources have to be developed."

          Propene's significance in the chemical industry has evolved substantially over the years. It is a key building block for many important petrochemicals, including polypropylene, acrylonitrile, propylene oxide, cumene, phenol, and isopropyl alcohol. The demand for propylene has been steadily increasing, with an annual average growth rate of 5.7% since 1990. By 2000, propylene production was about 52 million tonnes, and it was projected to reach 84 million tonnes by 2010, primarily driven by the increasing demand for polypropylene.

However, the literature does not specifically discuss propane dehydrogenation as a preferred production method or its economic and environmental advantages. Currently, only about 2% of worldwide propylene production comes from specific on-purpose processes, which include propane dehydrogenation. The majority of propylene (70%) is produced from steam crackers, followed by fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) units (28%).

The document suggests that to meet future demand, the market share of propylene from processes other than steam cracking is expected to grow significantly. This is because the propylene market is forecast to grow faster than the ethylene market. While the capacity of on-purpose propylene processes (including propane dehydrogenation) is expected to quadruple in the next 5 years, it will still only cover a small part of the growing propylene demand, indicating that other sources will need to be developed.

The provided information does not discuss the economic and environmental advantages of propane dehydrogenation or its increasing adoption as a preferred production method. Instead, it focuses on the overall growth of propylene demand and the need for alternative production methods to supplement traditional sources.

          丙烯在化工行业的重要性多年来已显著演变。它是许多重要石油化学品的关键构建模块，包括聚丙烯、丙烯腈、环氧丙烷、异丙苯、苯酚和异丙醇。丙烯的需求一直在稳步增长，自1990年以来年平均增长率为5.7%。到2000年，丙烯产量约为5200万吨，预计到2010年将达到8400万吨，主要是由于聚丙烯需求的增加。

然而，文献并未具体讨论丙烷脱氢作为首选生产方法或其经济和环境优势。目前，全球丙烯产量中只有约2%来自特定的定向工艺，其中包括丙烷脱氢。大部分丙烯（70%）是由蒸汽裂解装置生产的，其次是流化催化裂化（FCC）装置（28%）。

文档表明，为满足未来需求，预计来自蒸汽裂解以外工艺的丙烯市场份额将显著增长。这是因为预计丙烯市场的增长速度将快于乙烯市场。虽然定向丙烯生产工艺（包括丙烷脱氢）的产能预计在未来五年内将增加四倍，但它们仍将只能满足不断增长的丙烯需求的一小部分，这表明需要开发其他来源。

提供的信息并未讨论丙烷脱氢的经济和环境优势，或其作为首选生产方法的采用增加。相反，它侧重于丙烯需求的整体增长以及需要替代生产方法来补充传统来源。
