          [1] "Light olefins (especially C=2C=4) are the most important feedstocks (>250 million metric tons per year) employed in the production of a vast array of chemicals, including polymers, oxygenates, and other derivatives."

[2] "Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) has supplied 5% of global propylene, which will anticipatively increase to 20% by 2020."

[3] "Direct dehydrogenation can be used by industry for the production of light olefins like ethylene, propylene, and butylenes, and so on. However, these processes are reversible and suffer from several limitations, such as, thermodynamic restriction on conversion and selectivity, strong endothermic main reaction and necessity to supply heat at high temperature, coke formation and resulting catalyst deactivation."

[4] "In contrast, oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) overcomes most of the obstacles existing in a direct dehydrogenation process. Because of the introduction of oxygen, there are no coking and equilibrium-limited problems; the reaction becomes exothermic and is able to proceed at lower temperature; furthermore, the rate of oxidation reaction is several orders of magnitude faster than that of the direct dehydrogenation."

          Propene's significance in the chemical industry has grown substantially, with light olefins including propene now being crucial feedstocks for producing over 250 million metric tons of various chemicals annually. These include polymers, oxygenates, and other derivatives, highlighting propene's versatility and importance across multiple applications.

The increasing demand for propene is driving greater adoption of propane dehydrogenation (PDH) as a production method. PDH's contribution to global propylene supply was expected to grow from 5% to 20% by 2020, indicating a rapid shift towards this approach to meet growing demand.

Propane dehydrogenation, particularly oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH), offers several economic and environmental advantages compared to traditional methods:

1. Improved efficiency: ODH overcomes limitations of direct dehydrogenation, such as thermodynamic restrictions and coke formation.
2. Lower energy requirements: ODH is exothermic and can proceed at lower temperatures, reducing energy costs.
3. Higher reaction rates: The oxidation reaction in ODH is orders of magnitude faster than direct dehydrogenation.
4. Reduced catalyst deactivation: The presence of oxygen prevents coking, extending catalyst life.
5. No equilibrium limitations: This allows for potentially higher yields.

These advantages make ODH a more sustainable and economically viable option for meeting the growing demand for propene across various industries and applications.

          丙烯在化工行业的重要性已显著提高，轻质烯烃（包括丙烯）现在是生产超过2.5亿公吨各种化学品的关键原料。这些化学品包括聚合物、含氧化合物和其他衍生物，突显了丙烯在多个应用领域的多功能性和重要性。

丙烯需求的增加正推动丙烷脱氢（PDH）作为生产方法的更广泛采用。PDH对全球丙烯供应的贡献预计将从5%增长到2020年的20%，表明为满足不断增长的需求，行业正在迅速转向这种方法。

丙烷脱氢，特别是氧化脱氢（ODH），与传统方法相比提供了几个经济和环境优势：

1. 提高效率：ODH克服了直接脱氢的局限性，如热力学限制和积碳形成。
2. 降低能源需求：ODH是放热反应，可在较低温度下进行，降低能源成本。
3. 更高的反应速率：ODH中的氧化反应比直接脱氢快几个数量级。
4. 减少催化剂失活：氧的存在防止了积碳，延长了催化剂寿命。
5. 无平衡限制：这可能允许更高的产率。

这些优势使ODH成为满足各行业和应用中不断增长的丙烯需求的更可持续和经济可行的选择。
