          [1] "Shale gas revolution in North America has recently promoted the mass production of natural gas liquids, specifically ethane and propane, making on-purpose olefin production from alkane dehydrogenation an attractive alternative to the traditional olefin production processes, such as steam crackers and fluid catalytic cracking of naphtha, light diesel, and other oil byproducts"

          [2] "Because of the economical feedstock, relatively higher selectivity towards propylene, and lower energy demand, propane dehydrogenation (PDH) has become one of the most competitive propylene production processes and has already been successfully commercialized by Honeywell UOP (Oleflex), CB&I Lummus (Catofin), and Uhde (STAR)."

          The significance of propene in the chemical industry has evolved due to the shale gas revolution in North America, which has led to increased production of natural gas liquids like propane. This abundance of economical feedstock has driven the adoption of propane dehydrogenation (PDH) as a preferred production method for propene.

          The growing demand for propene is driving the adoption of PDH for several reasons:

          1. Economical feedstock: The availability of low-cost propane from shale gas makes PDH more cost-effective.
          2. Higher selectivity: PDH provides relatively higher selectivity towards propylene compared to traditional methods.
          3. Lower energy demand: The process requires less energy than conventional olefin production techniques.

          These economic and environmental advantages have made PDH one of the most competitive propylene production processes. As a result, it has been successfully commercialized by major companies like Honeywell UOP, CB&I Lummus, and Uhde.

          The economic advantages of PDH include lower production costs due to cheaper feedstock and reduced energy consumption. Environmentally, the lower energy demand of PDH potentially translates to reduced carbon emissions compared to traditional olefin production methods.

          As the demand for propene grows across various applications in the chemical industry, PDH offers a more efficient and potentially more sustainable way to meet these needs, driving its adoption as a preferred production method for this versatile olefin.

          由于北美页岩气革命，丙烯在化工行业的重要性已经发生了变化，这导致了天然气液体（如丙烷）产量的增加。这种经济实惠的原料丰富，推动了丙烷脱氢（PDH）作为生产丙烯的首选方法的采用。

          丙烯需求的增长推动了PDH的采用，原因如下：

          1. 经济实惠的原料：来自页岩气的低成本丙烷使PDH更具成本效益。
          2. 更高的选择性：与传统方法相比，PDH提供了相对更高的丙烯选择性。
          3. 较低的能源需求：该过程比传统烯烃生产技术需要更少的能源。

          这些经济和环境优势使PDH成为最具竞争力的丙烯生产工艺之一。因此，它已被霍尼韦尔UOP、CB&I Lummus和Uhde等大公司成功商业化。

          PDH的经济优势包括由于更便宜的原料和降低的能源消耗而降低生产成本。从环境角度来看，PDH较低的能源需求可能意味着与传统烯烃生产方法相比，碳排放量有所减少。

          随着化工行业各种应用对丙烯需求的增长，PDH提供了一种更有效且可能更可持续的方式来满足这些需求，推动其成为这种多用途烯烃的首选生产方法。
