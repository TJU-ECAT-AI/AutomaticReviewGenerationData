The significance of propene in the chemical industry has evolved substantially over the past decades, driven by increasing demand across various applications. Propene has become one of the most important building blocks in the petrochemical industry, second only to ethylene, with global production capacity reaching 110-115 million metric tons annually [10.1039/D0CS01174F]. Its versatility is evident in its wide range of applications, including the production of polypropylene, acrylonitrile, propylene oxide, acrylic acid, isopropylbenzene, and butyl alcohol [10.1021/acscatal.3c00728\_0].

The growing demand for propene, outpacing that of ethylene, has created a supply gap that traditional production methods like steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) struggle to fill [10.1016/j.cattod.2007.05.009]. This shortfall has driven the adoption of propane dehydrogenation (PDH) as a preferred production method. PDH, particularly its variant oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH), offers several economic and environmental advantages:

1. Economic Viability: PDH utilizes abundant and cheap propane feedstock from natural gas and shale gas, making it cost-effective [10.1016/j.cej.2018.09.210]. It's estimated that by 2025, PDH could supply approximately 30% of global propylene production [10.1039/D0CS01174F].

2. Energy Efficiency: ODH is exothermic, requiring lower reaction temperatures and potentially reducing energy consumption by up to 45% compared to traditional methods [10.1126/science.aaf7885].

3. Environmental Benefits: PDH, especially ODH, contributes to minimal environmental pollution due to its lower energy demand and high product selectivity [10.1021/acs.iecr.7b00759].

4. Process Advantages: ODH overcomes limitations of direct dehydrogenation, such as coke formation and thermodynamic constraints, leading to improved catalyst stability and potentially higher yields [10.1039/C8CC04604B].

5. CO2 Utilization: Recent developments in using CO2 as a co-feed gas in PDH offer additional environmental benefits by utilizing this greenhouse gas [10.1016/j.jcat.2015.12.015].

However, challenges remain, particularly in terms of catalyst performance and selectivity. Ongoing research focuses on developing more efficient catalysts to further improve the economic and environmental advantages of PDH and ODH [10.1016/j.cattod.2009.01.018].



Integrative understanding and prospective outlook: The evolution of propene production methods reflects the chemical industry's adaptation to changing market demands and environmental concerns. As the demand for propene continues to grow, driven by the expansion of its applications in various sectors, the industry is likely to see further innovations in production technologies.

Future research may focus on:
1. Advanced catalyst design: Developing catalysts that offer higher selectivity, improved stability, and resistance to coking, potentially using novel materials or nanotechnology.
2. Process intensification: Integrating PDH/ODH with other processes to create more efficient, closed-loop systems that minimize waste and energy consumption.
3. Renewable feedstocks: Exploring bio-based sources of propane or direct routes to propene from biomass to reduce dependence on fossil fuels.
4. AI and machine learning applications: Utilizing these technologies for optimizing reactor conditions, predicting catalyst performance, and accelerating the discovery of new catalytic materials.
5. Circular economy approaches: Developing technologies for efficient recycling of polypropylene and other propene-derived products to create a more sustainable production cycle.

These advancements could further enhance the economic and environmental benefits of propene production, solidifying its position as a key building block in the sustainable chemical industry of the future.

Propene's significance in the chemical industry has evolved substantially over the past few decades, driven by increasing demand across various applications. Initially produced as a byproduct of petroleum refining, propene has become one of the most important building blocks in the petrochemical industry, second only to ethylene [10.1021/acscatal.3c00728\_0]. Global demand for propene has grown rapidly, with consumption reaching approximately 115 million tons in 2019 [10.1039/D0CS01174F]. This increasing demand is primarily driven by the production of various value-added chemicals and polymer products, including polypropylene, propylene oxide, acrylonitrile, acrylic acid, isopropylbenzene, and butyl alcohol [10.1021/acscatal.3c00728\_0].

The growing demand for propene, coupled with changes in feedstock availability, has led to a supply gap that traditional production methods such as steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) cannot adequately fill [10.1016/j.ces.2004.07.103]. This shortfall has driven the adoption of propane dehydrogenation (PDH) as a preferred production method. PDH offers several economic and environmental advantages:

1. On-purpose production: PDH allows for targeted propene production, aligning better with market demand compared to steam cracking, which favors ethylene production [10.1016/j.cattod.2007.05.009].

2. Feedstock flexibility: PDH can utilize propane from natural gas and shale gas resources, which have become increasingly abundant and cost-effective [10.1016/j.cej.2018.09.210].

3. Energy efficiency: While traditional PDH is endothermic, oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of propane is exothermic, potentially requiring less energy input [10.1039/D0CS01174F].

4. Reduced CO2 emissions: PDH typically results in lower CO2 emissions compared to steam cracking, contributing to a reduced environmental footprint [10.1016/j.cattod.2007.05.009].

5. Improved yield: PDH can offer higher propylene yields compared to FCC, which produces relatively small amounts of propylene [10.1016/j.cattod.2007.05.009].

6. Economic viability: With increasing oil prices, PDH has become more economically attractive, especially when using abundant and low-cost propane feedstock [10.1016/j.cattod.2009.01.018].

However, traditional PDH faces challenges such as coke formation and catalyst deactivation. To address these issues, oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) has emerged as a promising alternative. ODH offers additional advantages, including:

1. Lower reaction temperatures: ODH can proceed at lower temperatures, reducing energy requirements [10.1021/acscatal.3c00728\_0].

2. Reduced coking: The presence of oxygen in ODH helps prevent coke formation, extending catalyst life [10.1039/C8CC04604B].

3. No equilibrium limitations: This allows for potentially higher conversions [10.1021/acs.accounts.8b00330].

4. Potential for CO2 utilization: Using CO2 as a co-feed gas in ODH can act as a mild oxidant, potentially utilizing this greenhouse gas in the process [10.1016/j.jcat.2015.12.015].

The adoption of PDH and ODH for propene production is expected to grow significantly. By 2025, it is forecasted that catalytic dehydrogenation of propane could supply approximately 30% of global propylene production [10.1039/D0CS01174F]. This shift towards more efficient and environmentally friendly production methods reflects the chemical industry's efforts to meet the increasing demand for propene while addressing sustainability concerns.



Integrative understanding and prospective outlook: The evolution of propene production methods, particularly the shift towards PDH and ODH, represents a significant adaptation in the chemical industry to meet growing demand while addressing environmental and economic challenges. This trend is likely to continue, with further research and development focusing on improving catalyst performance, process efficiency, and environmental sustainability.

Future research may concentrate on:

1. Advanced catalyst design: Developing catalysts that offer higher selectivity, improved stability, and resistance to coking, potentially incorporating novel materials or nanotechnology.

2. Process intensification: Exploring innovative reactor designs and process configurations to enhance energy efficiency and reduce capital costs.

3. CO2 utilization: Further investigating the use of CO2 as a co-feed in ODH, potentially contributing to carbon capture and utilization efforts.

4. Renewable feedstocks: Exploring the potential for bio-based propane or other renewable sources as feedstocks for PDH/ODH processes.

5. Hybrid technologies: Investigating the integration of PDH/ODH with other processes or renewable energy sources to create more sustainable and efficient production systems.

6. Artificial intelligence and machine learning: Utilizing these technologies for process optimization, predictive maintenance, and catalyst design.

As the demand for propene continues to grow and environmental regulations become more stringent, these research directions could play a crucial role in shaping the future of propene production, potentially leading to more sustainable and economically viable processes in the petrochemical industry.
