Propene's significance in the chemical industry has evolved substantially over the past few decades, driven by its versatility as a key building block for numerous valuable products. The demand for propene has been growing faster than that of ethylene, especially in Western Europe, with global consumption reaching 115 million tons in 2019 [10.1039/D0CS01174F]. This increasing demand is primarily due to the expanding use of propene-derived products such as polypropylene, propylene oxide, acrylonitrile, acrylic acid, isopropylbenzene, and butyl alcohol [10.1021/acscatal.3c00728\_0].

The growing demand for propene has driven the adoption of propane dehydrogenation (PDH) as a preferred production method. Traditional sources like steam crackers and fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) units are no longer sufficient to meet the increasing market needs [10.1016/j.cattod.2007.05.009]. PDH has become more attractive due to several economic and environmental advantages:

1. Targeted production: PDH allows for on-purpose propene production, aligning better with market demand compared to steam cracking, which favors ethylene production [10.1016/j.cattod.2007.05.009].

2. Feedstock flexibility: PDH can utilize propane from natural gas and shale gas resources, which have become increasingly abundant and cost-effective [10.1016/j.cej.2018.09.210].

3. Energy efficiency: PDH generally requires less energy than steam cracking, as it doesn't need the high temperatures for cracking larger hydrocarbons [10.1016/j.cattod.2007.05.009].

4. Reduced CO2 emissions: PDH typically results in lower CO2 emissions compared to steam cracking, contributing to a reduced environmental footprint [10.1016/j.cattod.2007.05.009].

5. Improved yield: PDH can offer higher propylene yields compared to FCC, which produces relatively small amounts of propylene [10.1016/j.cattod.2007.05.009].

However, traditional PDH faces some challenges, such as being highly endothermic, requiring high temperatures, and suffering from rapid catalyst deactivation due to coke formation [10.1007/s11244-020-01383-z]. To address these issues, oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) has emerged as a promising alternative, offering additional advantages:

1. Exothermic reaction: ODH is exothermic, potentially requiring less energy input [10.1039/D0CS01174F].

2. Lower operating temperatures: ODH can proceed at lower temperatures, reducing energy costs [10.1039/C8CC04604B].

3. Reduced coking: The presence of oxygen in ODH prevents coke formation, extending catalyst life [10.1039/C8CC04604B].

4. No equilibrium limitations: This allows for potentially higher yields [10.1039/C8CC04604B].

5. Faster reaction rates: The oxidation reaction in ODH is orders of magnitude faster than direct dehydrogenation [10.1039/C8CC04604B].

The adoption of PDH and ODH reflects the chemical industry's efforts to meet the increasing demand for propylene while addressing environmental concerns and energy efficiency requirements. It is estimated that by 2025, catalytic dehydrogenation of propane would supply approximately 30% of the global propylene production [10.1039/D0CS01174F].



Integrative understanding and prospective outlook: The evolution of propene production methods, particularly the shift towards PDH and ODH, represents a significant paradigm shift in the chemical industry. This transition not only addresses the growing demand for propene but also aligns with broader sustainability goals and energy efficiency requirements.

Looking forward, research efforts are likely to focus on further improving catalyst performance for PDH and ODH processes. This may include developing novel catalysts with higher selectivity, improved stability, and resistance to coking. Additionally, there is potential for exploring hybrid processes that combine the advantages of different production methods.

The use of CO2 as a co-feed gas in dehydrogenation processes [10.1016/j.jcat.2015.12.015] opens up exciting possibilities for carbon utilization and mitigation of greenhouse gas emissions. Future research could explore the integration of CO2 capture technologies with propene production, creating a more circular and sustainable production cycle.

As the demand for propene continues to grow, there may also be increased interest in developing bio-based routes for propene production, further reducing reliance on fossil fuel feedstocks. This could involve the development of new catalytic processes for converting bio-derived compounds into propene or its precursors.

The ongoing evolution of propene production methods highlights the dynamic nature of the chemical industry and its ability to adapt to changing economic and environmental pressures. As we move towards a more sustainable future, the lessons learned from the development of PDH and ODH technologies may inform the development of cleaner, more efficient processes for other important chemical commodities.

Propene's significance in the chemical industry has evolved substantially over the past few decades, driven by its versatility as a key building block for numerous valuable products. The demand for propene has been growing faster than that of ethylene, especially in Western Europe [10.1016/j.cattod.2007.05.009]. This increasing demand has led to a shift in production methods, with propane dehydrogenation (PDH) emerging as a preferred approach.

The adoption of PDH, particularly oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH), is driven by several factors:

1. Economic viability: PDH offers a more cost-effective route for propene production, especially with the availability of cheap propane from shale gas and natural gas sources [10.1016/j.cej.2018.09.210]. By 2020, it was estimated that approximately 20% of propylene would be produced by on-purpose processes like PDH [10.1021/acs.accounts.8b00330].

2. Environmental benefits: PDH, especially ODH, is considered more environmentally friendly compared to traditional methods like steam cracking or fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) [10.1039/D0CS01174F]. ODH offers lower energy requirements and reduced CO2 emissions [10.1002/anie.201507119].

3. Process advantages: ODH overcomes limitations of direct dehydrogenation, such as coke formation and thermodynamic constraints. It is exothermic, allowing for lower reaction temperatures and potentially higher conversion rates [10.1039/C8CC04604B].

4. Feedstock flexibility: The abundant availability of propane in natural gas and refinery off-gases makes PDH a sustainable option for propene production [10.1039/C6CY00078A].

5. Market demand: The propylene market is growing faster than the ethylene market, necessitating dedicated production methods like PDH [10.1016/j.cattod.2005.07.109].

However, challenges remain in the widespread adoption of PDH and ODH:

1. Catalyst development: Improving catalyst performance, stability, and selectivity is crucial for enhancing the economic attractiveness of PDH processes [10.1016/j.cattod.2009.01.018].

2. Process optimization: While ODH offers advantages over direct dehydrogenation, issues like overoxidation of propylene to CO2 need to be addressed to improve overall efficiency [10.1002/cctc.201700004].

3. Scale-up: Despite the potential benefits, on-purpose propylene production processes, including PDH, still only cover a small part of the growing propylene demand [10.1016/j.cattod.2005.07.109].



Integrative understanding and prospective outlook: The evolution of propene's significance in the chemical industry and the shift towards propane dehydrogenation methods highlight a broader trend in the petrochemical sector towards more sustainable and efficient production processes. As the demand for propene continues to grow, driven by its diverse applications in polymers, oxygenates, and other chemical intermediates, the industry is likely to see further innovations in catalyst design and process engineering for PDH and ODH.

Future research efforts may focus on developing novel catalysts that can further improve selectivity and stability in ODH processes, potentially incorporating advanced materials like metal-organic frameworks or nanostructured composites. Additionally, the integration of PDH processes with renewable energy sources could further enhance their environmental benefits, aligning with global efforts to reduce carbon emissions in industrial processes.

The use of CO2 as a co-feed gas in dehydrogenation processes also presents an intriguing avenue for future development, potentially offering a way to utilize this greenhouse gas productively. This approach could contribute to circular economy initiatives in the chemical industry, turning a waste product into a valuable resource.

As the chemical industry continues to evolve, we may see increased integration of propene production with other chemical processes, creating more efficient and sustainable value chains. This could include the development of modular, small-scale PDH units that can be deployed flexibly to meet local demand, reducing transportation costs and associated emissions.

The ongoing transition towards more sustainable propene production methods also underscores the need for comprehensive life cycle assessments to fully understand the environmental impacts and benefits of these new technologies. This holistic approach will be crucial in guiding future developments and ensuring that innovations in propene production truly contribute to a more sustainable chemical industry.
