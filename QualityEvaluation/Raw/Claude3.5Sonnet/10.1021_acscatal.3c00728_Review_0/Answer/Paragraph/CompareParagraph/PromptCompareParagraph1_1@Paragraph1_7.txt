Propene's significance in the chemical industry has evolved substantially over the past few decades, driven by its versatility as a key building block for numerous valuable products. The demand for propene has been growing faster than that of ethylene, especially in Western Europe, with global consumption reaching 115 million tons in 2019 [10.1039/D0CS01174F]. This increasing demand is primarily due to its use in producing a wide range of petrochemicals, including polypropylene, acrylonitrile, propylene oxide, cumene, phenol, acrylic acid, isopropyl alcohol, and many others [10.1021/acscatal.3c00728\_0].

The growing demand for propene has outpaced the supply from traditional sources such as steam crackers and fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) units [10.1016/j.ces.2004.07.103]. This supply-demand gap has driven the adoption of propane dehydrogenation (PDH) as a preferred production method. PDH, particularly oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH), offers several economic and environmental advantages:

1. Economic viability: PDH is considered more economical compared to traditional methods, especially with increasing oil prices [10.1016/j.cattod.2009.01.018]. It allows for the utilization of abundant and cheap propane from natural gas and shale gas resources [10.1016/j.cej.2018.09.210].

2. Energy efficiency: ODH is exothermic, potentially requiring less energy input compared to endothermic processes like steam cracking [10.1039/C8CC04604B]. It is estimated that the potential energy savings for moving to ODH could be 45% of the energy consumption [10.1126/science.aaf7885].

3. Environmental benefits: PDH, especially ODH, contributes to minimum environmental pollution due to its low energy demand and high product selectivity [10.1021/acs.iecr.7b00759]. It also offers the potential for reduced CO2 emissions compared to traditional methods [10.1002/anie.201507119].

4. Process advantages: ODH overcomes limitations such as coke formation and equilibrium constraints faced by traditional dehydrogenation methods [10.1039/C8CC04604B]. The use of CO2 as a co-feed gas in some ODH processes provides additional benefits, acting as a mild oxidant and utilizing an abundant greenhouse gas [10.1016/j.jcat.2015.12.015].

5. Targeted production: PDH allows for on-purpose propene production, better aligning with market demands compared to steam cracking, which favors ethylene production [10.1016/j.cattod.2007.05.009].

The adoption of PDH has been growing rapidly, with its share in global propylene production expected to increase from about 10% currently to approximately 30% by 2025 [10.1039/D0CS01174F]. However, challenges remain, including the need for improved catalysts to enhance selectivity and stability [10.1016/j.jcat.2008.11.014].



Integrative understanding and prospective outlook: The evolution of propene production methods, particularly the shift towards propane dehydrogenation, reflects the chemical industry's adaptation to changing feedstock availability, increasing demand, and stricter environmental regulations. As we look to the future, several key areas emerge for potential research and development:

1. Advanced catalyst design: Future research could focus on developing more efficient and stable catalysts for PDH and ODH processes, potentially incorporating nanotechnology or novel materials to enhance selectivity and reduce energy requirements.

2. Process intensification: Innovative reactor designs and process integration techniques could further improve the efficiency and economics of propene production, possibly combining PDH with other processes for synergistic benefits.

3. Renewable feedstocks: As the world moves towards more sustainable practices, exploring the potential of bio-based feedstocks for propene production could become increasingly important, aligning with circular economy principles.

4. CO2 utilization: Building on the use of CO2 as a co-feed in ODH, future research could explore more extensive integration of CO2 utilization in propene production, contributing to carbon capture and utilization efforts.

5. Artificial intelligence and machine learning: These technologies could be leveraged to optimize process conditions, predict catalyst performance, and guide the discovery of new materials for propene production.

6. Life cycle assessment: Comprehensive studies on the environmental impact of different propene production methods across their entire life cycle could guide future policy decisions and industry practices.

As the demand for propene continues to grow and diversify, these research directions could pave the way for more sustainable, efficient, and economically viable production methods, ensuring that this versatile olefin remains a cornerstone of the chemical industry in an increasingly environmentally conscious world.

The significance of propene in the chemical industry has evolved substantially over the past decades, driven by increasing demand across various applications. Propene has become one of the most important building blocks in the petrochemical industry, second only to ethylene, with global production capacity reaching 110-115 million metric tons annually [10.1039/D0CS01174F]. Its versatility is evident in its wide range of applications, including the production of polypropylene, acrylonitrile, propylene oxide, acrylic acid, isopropylbenzene, and butyl alcohol [10.1021/acscatal.3c00728\_0].

The growing demand for propene, outpacing that of ethylene, has created a supply gap that traditional production methods like steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) struggle to fill [10.1016/j.cattod.2007.05.009]. This shortfall has driven the adoption of propane dehydrogenation (PDH) as a preferred production method. PDH, particularly its variant oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH), offers several economic and environmental advantages:

1. Economic Viability: PDH utilizes abundant and cheap propane feedstock from natural gas and shale gas, making it cost-effective [10.1016/j.cej.2018.09.210]. It's estimated that by 2025, PDH could supply approximately 30% of global propylene production [10.1039/D0CS01174F].

2. Energy Efficiency: ODH is exothermic, requiring lower reaction temperatures and potentially reducing energy consumption by up to 45% compared to traditional methods [10.1126/science.aaf7885].

3. Environmental Benefits: PDH, especially ODH, contributes to minimal environmental pollution due to its lower energy demand and high product selectivity [10.1021/acs.iecr.7b00759].

4. Process Advantages: ODH overcomes limitations of direct dehydrogenation, such as coke formation and thermodynamic constraints, leading to improved catalyst stability and potentially higher yields [10.1039/C8CC04604B].

5. CO2 Utilization: Recent developments in using CO2 as a co-feed gas in PDH offer additional environmental benefits by utilizing this greenhouse gas [10.1016/j.jcat.2015.12.015].

However, challenges remain, particularly in terms of catalyst performance and selectivity. Ongoing research focuses on developing more efficient catalysts to further improve the economic and environmental advantages of PDH and ODH [10.1016/j.cattod.2009.01.018].



Integrative understanding and prospective outlook: The evolution of propene production methods reflects the chemical industry's adaptation to changing market demands and environmental concerns. As the demand for propene continues to grow, driven by the expansion of its applications in various sectors, the industry is likely to see further innovations in production technologies.

Future research may focus on:
1. Advanced catalyst design: Developing catalysts that offer higher selectivity, improved stability, and resistance to coking, potentially using novel materials or nanotechnology.
2. Process intensification: Integrating PDH/ODH with other processes to create more efficient, closed-loop systems that minimize waste and energy consumption.
3. Renewable feedstocks: Exploring bio-based sources of propane or direct routes to propene from biomass to reduce dependence on fossil fuels.
4. AI and machine learning applications: Utilizing these technologies for optimizing reactor conditions, predicting catalyst performance, and accelerating the discovery of new catalytic materials.
5. Circular economy approaches: Developing technologies for efficient recycling of polypropylene and other propene-derived products to create a more sustainable production cycle.

These advancements could further enhance the economic and environmental benefits of propene production, solidifying its position as a key building block in the sustainable chemical industry of the future.
