Propene's significance in the chemical industry has evolved substantially over the past few decades, driven by its versatility as a key building block for numerous valuable products. The demand for propene has been growing faster than that of ethylene, especially in Western Europe, with global consumption reaching 115 million tons in 2019 [10.1039/D0CS01174F]. This increasing demand is primarily due to its use in producing a wide range of petrochemicals, including polypropylene, acrylonitrile, propylene oxide, cumene, phenol, acrylic acid, isopropyl alcohol, and many others [10.1021/acscatal.3c00728\_0].

The growing demand for propene has outpaced the supply from traditional sources such as steam crackers and fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) units [10.1016/j.ces.2004.07.103]. This supply-demand gap has driven the adoption of propane dehydrogenation (PDH) as a preferred production method. PDH, particularly oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH), offers several economic and environmental advantages:

1. Economic viability: PDH is considered more economical compared to traditional methods, especially with increasing oil prices [10.1016/j.cattod.2009.01.018]. It allows for the utilization of abundant and cheap propane from natural gas and shale gas resources [10.1016/j.cej.2018.09.210].

2. Energy efficiency: ODH is exothermic, potentially requiring less energy input compared to endothermic processes like steam cracking [10.1039/C8CC04604B]. It is estimated that the potential energy savings for moving to ODH could be 45% of the energy consumption [10.1126/science.aaf7885].

3. Environmental benefits: PDH, especially ODH, contributes to minimum environmental pollution due to its low energy demand and high product selectivity [10.1021/acs.iecr.7b00759]. It also offers the potential for reduced CO2 emissions compared to traditional methods [10.1002/anie.201507119].

4. Process advantages: ODH overcomes limitations such as coke formation and equilibrium constraints faced by traditional dehydrogenation methods [10.1039/C8CC04604B]. The use of CO2 as a co-feed gas in some ODH processes provides additional benefits, acting as a mild oxidant and utilizing an abundant greenhouse gas [10.1016/j.jcat.2015.12.015].

5. Targeted production: PDH allows for on-purpose propene production, better aligning with market demands compared to steam cracking, which favors ethylene production [10.1016/j.cattod.2007.05.009].

The adoption of PDH has been growing rapidly, with its share in global propylene production expected to increase from about 10% currently to approximately 30% by 2025 [10.1039/D0CS01174F]. However, challenges remain, including the need for improved catalysts to enhance selectivity and stability [10.1016/j.jcat.2008.11.014].



Integrative understanding and prospective outlook: The evolution of propene production methods, particularly the shift towards propane dehydrogenation, reflects the chemical industry's adaptation to changing feedstock availability, increasing demand, and stricter environmental regulations. As we look to the future, several key areas emerge for potential research and development:

1. Advanced catalyst design: Future research could focus on developing more efficient and stable catalysts for PDH and ODH processes, potentially incorporating nanotechnology or novel materials to enhance selectivity and reduce energy requirements.

2. Process intensification: Innovative reactor designs and process integration techniques could further improve the efficiency and economics of propene production, possibly combining PDH with other processes for synergistic benefits.

3. Renewable feedstocks: As the world moves towards more sustainable practices, exploring the potential of bio-based feedstocks for propene production could become increasingly important, aligning with circular economy principles.

4. CO2 utilization: Building on the use of CO2 as a co-feed in ODH, future research could explore more extensive integration of CO2 utilization in propene production, contributing to carbon capture and utilization efforts.

5. Artificial intelligence and machine learning: These technologies could be leveraged to optimize process conditions, predict catalyst performance, and guide the discovery of new materials for propene production.

6. Life cycle assessment: Comprehensive studies on the environmental impact of different propene production methods across their entire life cycle could guide future policy decisions and industry practices.

As the demand for propene continues to grow and diversify, these research directions could pave the way for more sustainable, efficient, and economically viable production methods, ensuring that this versatile olefin remains a cornerstone of the chemical industry in an increasingly environmentally conscious world.

Propene's significance in the chemical industry has evolved substantially over the past few decades, driven by its versatility as a key building block for numerous valuable products. The demand for propene has been growing faster than that of ethylene, especially in Western Europe [10.1016/j.cattod.2007.05.009]. This increasing demand has led to a shift in production methods, with propane dehydrogenation (PDH) emerging as a preferred approach.

The adoption of PDH, particularly oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH), is driven by several factors:

1. Economic viability: PDH offers a more cost-effective route for propene production, especially with the availability of cheap propane from shale gas and natural gas sources [10.1016/j.cej.2018.09.210]. By 2020, it was estimated that approximately 20% of propylene would be produced by on-purpose processes like PDH [10.1021/acs.accounts.8b00330].

2. Environmental benefits: PDH, especially ODH, is considered more environmentally friendly compared to traditional methods like steam cracking or fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) [10.1039/D0CS01174F]. ODH offers lower energy requirements and reduced CO2 emissions [10.1002/anie.201507119].

3. Process advantages: ODH overcomes limitations of direct dehydrogenation, such as coke formation and thermodynamic constraints. It is exothermic, allowing for lower reaction temperatures and potentially higher conversion rates [10.1039/C8CC04604B].

4. Feedstock flexibility: The abundant availability of propane in natural gas and refinery off-gases makes PDH a sustainable option for propene production [10.1039/C6CY00078A].

5. Market demand: The propylene market is growing faster than the ethylene market, necessitating dedicated production methods like PDH [10.1016/j.cattod.2005.07.109].

However, challenges remain in the widespread adoption of PDH and ODH:

1. Catalyst development: Improving catalyst performance, stability, and selectivity is crucial for enhancing the economic attractiveness of PDH processes [10.1016/j.cattod.2009.01.018].

2. Process optimization: While ODH offers advantages over direct dehydrogenation, issues like overoxidation of propylene to CO2 need to be addressed to improve overall efficiency [10.1002/cctc.201700004].

3. Scale-up: Despite the potential benefits, on-purpose propylene production processes, including PDH, still only cover a small part of the growing propylene demand [10.1016/j.cattod.2005.07.109].



Integrative understanding and prospective outlook: The evolution of propene's significance in the chemical industry and the shift towards propane dehydrogenation methods highlight a broader trend in the petrochemical sector towards more sustainable and efficient production processes.
