The increasing demand for propene has outpaced the supply from traditional sources such as steam crackers and fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) units [10.1016/j.ces.2004.07.103]. This supply-demand gap has driven the adoption of propane dehydrogenation (PDH) as a preferred production method. PDH, particularly oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH), offers several economic and environmental advantages:

1. Economic viability: PDH is considered more economical compared to traditional methods, especially with rising oil prices [10.1016/j.cattod.2009.01.018]. It allows for the utilization of abundant and cheap propane from natural gas and shale gas resources [10.1016/j.cej.2018.09.210].

2. Energy efficiency: ODH is exothermic, requiring lower reaction temperatures and potentially reducing energy consumption by up to 45% compared to current production methods [10.1126/science.aaf7885].

3. Environmental benefits: PDH processes, especially ODH, contribute to minimal environmental pollution due to lower energy demand and high product selectivity [10.1021/acs.iecr.7b00759].

4. Improved catalyst stability: ODH prevents coke deposition on catalyst surfaces, extending catalyst life and reducing regeneration needs [10.1039/C8CC04604B].

5. Higher selectivity: PDH offers relatively higher selectivity towards propylene compared to traditional cracking methods [10.1016/j.cej.2018.09.210].

6. Utilization of CO2: Recent developments in using CO2 as a co-feed gas for dehydrogenation offer additional environmental benefits by utilizing this greenhouse gas [10.1016/j.jcat.2015.12.015].

Despite these advantages, challenges remain in the widespread adoption of PDH and ODH technologies. These include optimizing catalyst performance, improving selectivity, and scaling up processes to meet the growing global demand for propene [10.1002/cctc.201700004].



Integrative understanding and prospective outlook: The evolution of propene's significance in the chemical industry and the shift towards propane dehydrogenation technologies represent a broader trend in the petrochemical sector towards more sustainable and efficient production methods. As global demand for propene continues to grow, driven by expanding applications in various industries, the need for innovative production technologies becomes increasingly critical.

Future research and development efforts are likely to focus on several key areas:

1. Advanced catalyst design: Developing more efficient and stable catalysts for PDH and ODH processes, potentially incorporating novel materials or nanotechnology to enhance performance and selectivity.

2. Process intensification: Exploring new reactor designs and process configurations to improve energy efficiency and reduce capital costs associated with propene production.

3. Integration with renewable energy sources: Investigating ways to couple PDH processes with renewable energy to further reduce the carbon footprint of propene production.

4. Circular economy approaches: Developing technologies for the recycling and upcycling of propene-based products, creating a more sustainable lifecycle for this versatile olefin.

5. Hybrid technologies: Combining PDH with other emerging technologies, such as membrane separation or electrochemical processes, to create more efficient and flexible production systems.

6. Artificial intelligence and machine learning: Utilizing advanced data analytics and modeling techniques to optimize process conditions and predict catalyst performance in real-time.

As the chemical industry continues to evolve towards more sustainable practices, propene production through advanced dehydrogenation technologies is likely to play a crucial role in meeting the growing global demand while addressing environmental concerns and energy efficiency requirements.

Propene's significance in the chemical industry has evolved substantially over the past few decades, driven by increasing demand across various applications. Initially produced as a byproduct of petroleum refining, propene has become one of the most important building blocks in the petrochemical industry, second only to ethylene [10.1021/acscatal.3c00728\_0]. Global demand for propene has grown rapidly, with consumption reaching approximately 115 million tons in 2019 [10.1039/D0CS01174F]. This increasing demand is primarily driven by the production of various value-added chemicals and polymer products, including polypropylene, propylene oxide, acrylonitrile, acrylic acid, isopropylbenzene, and butyl alcohol [10.1021/acscatal.3c00728\_0].

The growing demand for propene, coupled with changes in feedstock availability, has led to a supply gap that traditional production methods such as steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) cannot adequately fill [10.1016/j.ces.2004.07.103]. This shortfall has driven the adoption of propane dehydrogenation (PDH) as a preferred production method. PDH offers several economic and environmental advantages:

1. On-purpose production: PDH allows for targeted propene production, aligning better with market demand compared to steam cracking, which favors ethylene production [10.1016/j.cattod.2007.05.009].

2. Feedstock flexibility: PDH can utilize propane from natural gas and shale gas resources, which have become increasingly abundant and cost-effective [10.1016/j.cej.2018.09.210].

3. Energy efficiency: While traditional PDH is endothermic, oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of propane is exothermic, potentially requiring less energy input [10.1039/D0CS01174F].

4. Reduced CO2 emissions: PDH typically results in lower CO2 emissions compared to steam cracking, contributing to a reduced environmental footprint [10.1016/j.cattod.2007.05.009].

5. Improved yield: PDH can offer higher propylene yields compared to FCC, which produces relatively small amounts of propylene [10.1016/j.cattod.2007.05.009].

6. Economic viability: With increasing oil prices, PDH has become more economically attractive, especially when using abundant and low-cost propane feedstock [10.1016/j.cattod.2009.01.018].

However, traditional PDH faces challenges such as coke formation and catalyst deactivation. To address these issues, oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) has emerged as a promising alternative. ODH offers additional advantages, including:

1. Lower reaction temperatures: ODH can proceed at lower temperatures, reducing energy requirements [10.1021/acscatal.3c00728\_0].

2. Reduced coking: The presence of oxygen in ODH helps prevent coke formation, extending catalyst life [10.1039/C8CC04604B].

3. No equilibrium limitations: This allows for potentially higher conversions [10.1021/acs.accounts.8b00330].

4. Potential for CO2 utilization: Using CO2 as a co-feed gas in ODH can act as a mild oxidant, potentially utilizing this greenhouse gas in the process [10.1016/j.jcat.2015.12.015].

The adoption of PDH and ODH for propene production is expected to grow significantly. By 2025, it is forecasted that catalytic dehydrogenation of propane could supply approximately 30% of global propylene production [10.1039/D0CS01174F]. This shift towards more efficient and environmentally friendly production methods reflects the chemical industry's efforts to meet the increasing demand for propene while addressing sustainability concerns.



Integrative understanding and prospective outlook: The evolution of propene production methods, particularly the shift towards PDH and ODH, represents a significant adaptation in the chemical industry to meet growing demand while addressing environmental and economic challenges. This trend is likely to continue, with further research and development focusing on improving catalyst performance, process efficiency, and environmental sustainability.

Future research may concentrate on:

1. Advanced catalyst design: Developing catalysts that offer higher selectivity, improved stability, and resistance to coking, potentially incorporating novel materials or nanotechnology.

2. Process intensification: Exploring innovative reactor designs and process configurations to enhance energy efficiency and reduce capital costs.

3. CO2 utilization: Further investigating the use of CO2 as a co-feed in ODH, potentially contributing to carbon capture and utilization efforts.

4. Renewable feedstocks: Exploring the potential for bio-based propane or other renewable sources as feedstocks for PDH/ODH processes.

5. Hybrid technologies: Investigating the integration of PDH/ODH with other processes or renewable energy sources to create more sustainable and efficient production systems.

6. Artificial intelligence and machine learning: Utilizing these technologies for process optimization, predictive maintenance, and catalyst design.

As the demand for propene continues to grow and environmental regulations become more stringent, these research directions could play a crucial role in shaping the future of propene production, potentially leading to more sustainable and economically viable processes in the petrochemical industry.
