3. Reduced CO2 emissions: PDH typically results in lower CO2 emissions compared to steam cracking [10.1016/j.jcat.2008.11.014].

4. Utilization of CO2: Some PDH processes use CO2 as a co-feed gas, potentially helping to reduce greenhouse gas emissions [10.1016/j.jcat.2015.12.015].

5. Catalyst stability: ODH processes can reduce coking issues, improving catalyst stability and reducing the need for frequent regeneration [10.1039/C8CC04604B].

6. Process simplicity: ODH offers a simpler process compared to traditional methods, potentially reducing capital and operating costs [10.1016/j.cattod.2009.01.018].

However, challenges remain in the widespread adoption of PDH technologies. These include the need for further catalyst development to improve efficiency and selectivity, as well as addressing the endothermic nature of traditional PDH processes [10.1007/s11244-020-01383-z].



Integrative understanding and prospective outlook: The evolution of propene's significance in the chemical industry and the adoption of propane dehydrogenation technologies represent a significant shift in how we approach the production of this vital chemical feedstock. Looking forward, several key areas of development and research opportunities emerge:

1. Advanced catalyst design: Future research will likely focus on developing more efficient and stable catalysts for PDH processes, potentially incorporating novel materials or nanotechnology to enhance performance and selectivity.

2. Process intensification: Integrating PDH processes with other chemical production streams or renewable energy sources could lead to more efficient and sustainable production methods.

3. CO2 utilization: Further development of PDH processes that use CO2 as a co-feed could contribute to carbon capture and utilization efforts, aligning with broader sustainability goals.

4. Bioderived feedstocks: Exploring the potential of producing propane or propene from renewable sources could offer a more sustainable long-term solution for meeting propene demand.

5. Artificial intelligence and machine learning: These technologies could be applied to optimize PDH processes, predict catalyst performance, and improve overall efficiency.

6. Modular and distributed production: Developing smaller-scale, modular PDH units could enable more localized production, reducing transportation costs and improving supply chain resilience.

7. Hybrid technologies: Combining PDH with other emerging technologies, such as membrane reactors or microwave-assisted processes, could lead to novel production methods with improved efficiency and selectivity.

As the demand for propene continues to grow and environmental concerns become increasingly pressing, these areas of research and development will be crucial in shaping the future of propene production and its role in the chemical industry.

Propene's significance in the chemical industry has evolved substantially over the past few decades, driven by increasing demand across various applications. Initially produced as a byproduct of petroleum refining, propene has become one of the most important building blocks in the petrochemical industry, second only to ethylene [10.1021/acscatal.3c00728\_0]. Global demand for propene has grown rapidly, with consumption reaching approximately 115 million tons in 2019 [10.1039/D0CS01174F]. This increasing demand is primarily driven by the production of various value-added chemicals and polymer products, including polypropylene, propylene oxide, acrylonitrile, acrylic acid, isopropylbenzene, and butyl alcohol [10.1021/acscatal.3c00728\_0].

The growing demand for propene, coupled with changes in feedstock availability, has led to a supply gap that traditional production methods such as steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) cannot adequately fill [10.1016/j.ces.2004.07.103]. This shortfall has driven the adoption of propane dehydrogenation (PDH) as a preferred production method. PDH offers several economic and environmental advantages:

1. On-purpose production: PDH allows for targeted propene production, aligning better with market demand compared to steam cracking, which favors ethylene production [10.1016/j.cattod.2007.05.009].

2. Feedstock flexibility: PDH can utilize propane from natural gas and shale gas resources, which have become increasingly abundant and cost-effective [10.1016/j.cej.2018.09.210].

3. Energy efficiency: While traditional PDH is endothermic, oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of propane is exothermic, potentially requiring less energy input [10.1039/D0CS01174F].

4. Reduced CO2 emissions: PDH typically results in lower CO2 emissions compared to steam cracking, contributing to a reduced environmental footprint [10.1016/j.cattod.2007.05.009].

5. Improved yield: PDH can offer higher propylene yields compared to FCC, which produces relatively small amounts of propylene [10.1016/j.cattod.2007.05.009].

6. Economic viability: With increasing oil prices, PDH has become more economically attractive, especially when using abundant and low-cost propane feedstock [10.1016/j.cattod.2009.01.018].

However, traditional PDH faces challenges such as coke formation and catalyst deactivation. To address these issues, oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) has emerged as a promising alternative. ODH offers additional advantages, including:

1. Lower reaction temperatures: ODH can proceed at lower temperatures, reducing energy requirements [10.1021/acscatal.3c00728\_0].

2. Reduced coking: The presence of oxygen in ODH helps prevent coke formation, extending catalyst life [10.1039/C8CC04604B].

3. No equilibrium limitations: This allows for potentially higher conversions [10.1021/acs.accounts.8b00330].

4. Potential for CO2 utilization: Using CO2 as a co-feed gas in ODH can act as a mild oxidant, potentially utilizing this greenhouse gas in the process [10.1016/j.jcat.2015.12.015].

The adoption of PDH and ODH for propene production is expected to grow significantly. By 2025, it is forecasted that catalytic dehydrogenation of propane could supply approximately 30% of global propylene production [10.1039/D0CS01174F]. This shift towards more efficient and environmentally friendly production methods reflects the chemical industry's efforts to meet the increasing demand for propene while addressing sustainability concerns.



Integrative understanding and prospective outlook: The evolution of propene production methods, particularly the shift towards PDH and ODH, represents a significant adaptation in the chemical industry to meet growing demand while addressing environmental and economic challenges. This trend is likely to continue, with further research and development focusing on improving catalyst performance, process efficiency, and environmental sustainability.

Future research may concentrate on:

1. Advanced catalyst design: Developing catalysts that offer higher selectivity, improved stability, and resistance to coking, potentially incorporating novel materials or nanotechnology.

2. Process intensification: Exploring innovative reactor designs and process configurations to enhance energy efficiency and reduce capital costs.

3. CO2 utilization: Further investigating the use of CO2 as a co-feed in ODH, potentially contributing to carbon capture and utilization efforts.

4. Renewable feedstocks: Exploring the potential for bio-based propane or other renewable sources as feedstocks for PDH/ODH processes.

5. Hybrid technologies: Investigating the integration of PDH/ODH with other processes or renewable energy sources to create more sustainable and efficient production systems.

6. Artificial intelligence and machine learning: Utilizing these technologies for process optimization, predictive maintenance, and catalyst design.

As the demand for propene continues to grow and environmental regulations become more stringent, these research directions could play a crucial role in shaping the future of propene production, potentially leading to more sustainable and economically viable processes in the petrochemical industry.
