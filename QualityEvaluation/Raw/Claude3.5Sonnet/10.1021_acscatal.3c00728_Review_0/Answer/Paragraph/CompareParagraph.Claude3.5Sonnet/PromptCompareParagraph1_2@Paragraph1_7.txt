The significance of propene in the chemical industry has evolved substantially over the past few decades, driven by its increasing demand and versatility as a key building block for numerous products. Propene, also known as propylene, has become one of the most important organic feedstocks in the petrochemical industry, with global production capacity reaching 110-115 million metric tons annually [10.1021/acs.accounts.8b00330][10.1039/D0CS01174F]. Its applications span a wide range of valuable products, including polypropylene, acrylonitrile, propylene oxide, cumene, phenol, isopropyl alcohol, and many others [10.1016/j.cattod.2005.07.109][10.1021/acscatal.3c00728\_0].

The increasing demand for propene has outpaced the supply from traditional sources such as steam crackers and fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) units [10.1016/j.ces.2004.07.103]. This supply-demand gap has driven the adoption of propane dehydrogenation (PDH) as a preferred production method. PDH, particularly oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH), offers several economic and environmental advantages:

1. Economic viability: PDH is considered more economical compared to traditional methods, especially with rising oil prices [10.1016/j.cattod.2009.01.018]. It allows for the utilization of abundant and cheap propane from natural gas and shale gas resources [10.1016/j.cej.2018.09.210].

2. Energy efficiency: ODH is exothermic, requiring lower reaction temperatures and potentially reducing energy consumption by up to 45% compared to current production methods [10.1126/science.aaf7885].

3. Environmental benefits: PDH processes, especially ODH, contribute to minimal environmental pollution due to lower energy demand and high product selectivity [10.1021/acs.iecr.7b00759].

4. Improved catalyst stability: ODH prevents coke deposition on catalyst surfaces, extending catalyst life and reducing regeneration needs [10.1039/C8CC04604B].

5. Higher selectivity: PDH offers relatively higher selectivity towards propylene compared to traditional cracking methods [10.1016/j.cej.2018.09.210].

6. Utilization of CO2: Recent developments in using CO2 as a co-feed gas for dehydrogenation offer additional environmental benefits by utilizing this greenhouse gas [10.1016/j.jcat.2015.12.015].

Despite these advantages, challenges remain in the widespread adoption of PDH and ODH technologies. These include optimizing catalyst performance, improving selectivity, and scaling up processes to meet the growing global demand for propene [10.1002/cctc.201700004].



Integrative understanding and prospective outlook: The evolution of propene's significance in the chemical industry and the shift towards propane dehydrogenation technologies represent a broader trend in the petrochemical sector towards more sustainable and efficient production methods. As global demand for propene continues to grow, driven by expanding applications in various industries, the need for innovative production technologies becomes increasingly critical.

Future research and development efforts are likely to focus on several key areas:

1. Advanced catalyst design: Developing more efficient and stable catalysts for PDH and ODH processes, potentially incorporating novel materials or nanotechnology to enhance performance and selectivity.

2. Process intensification: Exploring new reactor designs and process configurations to improve energy efficiency and reduce capital costs associated with propene production.

3. Integration with renewable energy sources: Investigating ways to couple PDH processes with renewable energy to further reduce the carbon footprint of propene production.

4. Circular economy approaches: Developing technologies for the recycling and upcycling of propene-based products, creating a more sustainable lifecycle for this versatile olefin.

5. Hybrid technologies: Combining PDH with other emerging technologies, such as membrane separation or electrochemical processes, to create more efficient and flexible production systems.

6. Artificial intelligence and machine learning: Utilizing advanced data analytics and modeling techniques to optimize process conditions and predict catalyst performance in real-time.

As the chemical industry continues to evolve towards more sustainable practices, propene production through advanced dehydrogenation technologies is likely to play a crucial role in meeting the growing global demand while addressing environmental concerns and energy efficiency requirements.

The significance of propene in the chemical industry has evolved substantially over the past decades, driven by increasing demand across various applications. Propene has become one of the most important building blocks in the petrochemical industry, second only to ethylene, with global production capacity reaching 110-115 million metric tons annually [10.1039/D0CS01174F]. Its versatility is evident in its wide range of applications, including the production of polypropylene, acrylonitrile, propylene oxide, acrylic acid, isopropylbenzene, and butyl alcohol [10.1021/acscatal.3c00728\_0].

The growing demand for propene, outpacing that of ethylene, has created a supply gap that traditional production methods like steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) struggle to fill [10.1016/j.cattod.2007.05.009]. This shortfall has driven the adoption of propane dehydrogenation (PDH) as a preferred production method. PDH, particularly its variant oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH), offers several economic and environmental advantages:

1. Economic Viability: PDH utilizes abundant and cheap propane feedstock from natural gas and shale gas, making it cost-effective [10.1016/j.cej.2018.09.210]. It's estimated that by 2025, PDH could supply approximately 30% of global propylene production [10.1039/D0CS01174F].

2. Energy Efficiency: ODH is exothermic, requiring lower reaction temperatures and potentially reducing energy consumption by up to 45% compared to traditional methods [10.1126/science.aaf7885].

3. Environmental Benefits: PDH, especially ODH, contributes to minimal environmental pollution due to its lower energy demand and high product selectivity [10.1021/acs.iecr.7b00759].

4. Process Advantages: ODH overcomes limitations of direct dehydrogenation, such as coke formation and thermodynamic constraints, leading to improved catalyst stability and potentially higher yields [10.1039/C8CC04604B].

5. CO2 Utilization: Recent developments in using CO2 as a co-feed gas in PDH offer additional environmental benefits by utilizing this greenhouse gas [10.1016/j.jcat.2015.12.015].

However, challenges remain, particularly in terms of catalyst performance and selectivity. Ongoing research focuses on developing more efficient catalysts to further improve the economic and environmental advantages of PDH and ODH [10.1016/j.cattod.2009.01.018].



Integrative understanding and prospective outlook: The evolution of propene production methods reflects the chemical industry's adaptation to changing market demands and environmental concerns. As the demand for propene continues to grow, driven by the expansion of its applications in various sectors, the industry is likely to see further innovations in production technologies.

Future research may focus on:
1. Advanced catalyst design: Developing catalysts that offer higher selectivity, improved stability, and resistance to coking, potentially using novel materials or nanotechnology.
2. Process intensification: Integrating PDH/ODH with other processes to create more efficient, closed-loop systems that minimize waste and energy consumption.
3. Renewable feedstocks: Exploring bio-based sources of propane or direct routes to propene from biomass to reduce dependence on fossil fuels.
4. AI and machine learning applications: Utilizing these technologies for optimizing reactor conditions, predicting catalyst performance, and accelerating the discovery of new catalytic materials.
5. Circular economy approaches: Developing technologies for efficient recycling of polypropylene and other propene-derived products to create a more sustainable production cycle.

These advancements could further enhance the economic and environmental benefits of propene production, solidifying its position as a key building block in the sustainable chemical industry of the future.
