Propene's significance in the chemical industry has evolved substantially over the past few decades, driven by increasing demand across various applications. Initially produced as a byproduct of petroleum refining, propene has become one of the most important building blocks in the petrochemical industry, second only to ethylene [10.1021/acscatal.3c00728_0]. Global demand for propene has grown rapidly, with consumption reaching approximately 115 million tons in 2019 [10.1039/D0CS01174F]. This increasing demand is primarily driven by the production of various value-added chemicals and polymer products, including polypropylene, propylene oxide, acrylonitrile, acrylic acid, isopropylbenzene, and butyl alcohol [10.1021/acscatal.3c00728_0].

The growing demand for propene, coupled with changes in feedstock availability, has led to a supply gap that traditional production methods such as steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) cannot adequately fill [10.1016/j.ces.2004.07.103]. This shortfall has driven the adoption of propane dehydrogenation (PDH) as a preferred production method. PDH offers several economic and environmental advantages:

1. On-purpose production: PDH allows for targeted propene production, aligning better with market demand compared to steam cracking, which favors ethylene production [10.1016/j.cattod.2007.05.009].

2. Feedstock flexibility: PDH can utilize propane from natural gas and shale gas resources, which have become increasingly abundant and cost-effective [10.1016/j.cej.2018.09.210].

3. Energy efficiency: While traditional PDH is endothermic, oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of propane is exothermic, potentially requiring less energy input [10.1039/D0CS01174F].

4. Reduced CO2 emissions: PDH typically results in lower CO2 emissions compared to steam cracking, contributing to a reduced environmental footprint [10.1016/j.cattod.2007.05.009].

5. Improved yield: PDH can offer higher propylene yields compared to FCC, which produces relatively small amounts of propylene [10.1016/j.cattod.2007.05.009].

6. Economic viability: With increasing oil prices, PDH has become more economically attractive, especially when using abundant and low-cost propane feedstock [10.1016/j.cattod.2009.01.018].

However, traditional PDH faces challenges such as coke formation and catalyst deactivation. To address these issues, oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) has emerged as a promising alternative. ODH offers additional advantages, including:

1. Lower reaction temperatures: ODH can proceed at lower temperatures, reducing energy requirements [10.1021/acscatal.3c00728_0].

2. Reduced coking: The presence of oxygen in ODH helps prevent coke formation, extending catalyst life [10.1039/C8CC04604B].

3. No equilibrium limitations: This allows for potentially higher conversions [10.1021/acs.accounts.8b00330].

4. Potential for CO2 utilization: Using CO2 as a co-feed gas in ODH can act as a mild oxidant, potentially utilizing this greenhouse gas in the process [10.1016/j.jcat.2015.12.015].

The adoption of PDH and ODH for propene production is expected to grow significantly. By 2025, it is forecasted that catalytic dehydrogenation of propane could supply approximately 30% of global propylene production [10.1039/D0CS01174F]. This shift towards more efficient and environmentally friendly production methods reflects the chemical industry's efforts to meet the increasing demand for propene while addressing sustainability concerns.

※※※

Integrative understanding and prospective outlook: The evolution of propene production methods, particularly the shift towards PDH and ODH, represents a significant adaptation in the chemical industry to meet growing demand while addressing environmental and economic challenges. This trend is likely to continue, with further research and development focusing on improving catalyst performance, process efficiency, and environmental sustainability.

Future research may concentrate on:

1. Advanced catalyst design: Developing catalysts that offer higher selectivity, improved stability, and resistance to coking, potentially incorporating novel materials or nanotechnology.

2. Process intensification: Exploring innovative reactor designs and process configurations to enhance energy efficiency and reduce capital costs.

3. CO2 utilization: Further investigating the use of CO2 as a co-feed in ODH, potentially contributing to carbon capture and utilization efforts.

4. Renewable feedstocks: Exploring the potential for bio-based propane or other renewable sources as feedstocks for PDH/ODH processes.

5. Hybrid technologies: Investigating the integration of PDH/ODH with other processes or renewable energy sources to create more sustainable and efficient production systems.

6. Artificial intelligence and machine learning: Utilizing these technologies for process optimization, predictive maintenance, and catalyst design.

As the demand for propene continues to grow and environmental regulations become more stringent, these research directions could play a crucial role in shaping the future of propene production, potentially leading to more sustainable and economically viable processes in the petrochemical industry.

Propene's significance in the chemical industry has evolved substantially over the past few decades, driven by its versatility as a key building block for numerous valuable products. The demand for propene has been growing faster than that of ethylene, especially in Western Europe [10.1016/j.cattod.2007.05.009]. This increasing demand has led to a shift in production methods, with propane dehydrogenation (PDH) emerging as a preferred approach.

The adoption of PDH, particularly oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH), is driven by several factors:

1. Economic viability: PDH offers a more cost-effective route for propene production, especially with the availability of cheap propane from shale gas and natural gas sources [10.1016/j.cej.2018.09.210]. By 2020, it was estimated that approximately 20% of propylene would be produced by on-purpose processes like PDH [10.1021/acs.accounts.8b00330].

2. Environmental benefits: PDH, especially ODH, is considered more environmentally friendly compared to traditional methods like steam cracking or fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) [10.1039/D0CS01174F]. ODH offers lower energy requirements and reduced CO2 emissions [10.1002/anie.201507119].

3. Process advantages: ODH overcomes limitations of direct dehydrogenation, such as coke formation and thermodynamic constraints. It is exothermic, allowing for lower reaction temperatures and potentially higher conversion rates [10.1039/C8CC04604B].

4. Feedstock flexibility: The abundant availability of propane in natural gas and refinery off-gases makes PDH a sustainable option for propene production [10.1039/C6CY00078A].

5. Market demand: The propylene market is growing faster than the ethylene market, necessitating dedicated production methods like PDH [10.1016/j.cattod.2005.07.109].

Propene's significance in the chemical industry has evolved substantially over the past few decades, driven by its versatility as a key building block for numerous valuable products. The demand for propene has been growing faster than that of ethylene, especially in Western Europe, with global consumption reaching 115 million tons in 2019 [10.1039/D0CS01174F]. This increasing demand is primarily due to the expanding use of propene-derived products such as polypropylene, propylene oxide, acrylonitrile, acrylic acid, isopropylbenzene, and butyl alcohol [10.1021/acscatal.3c00728_0].

The growing demand for propene has driven the adoption of propane dehydrogenation (PDH) as a preferred production method. Traditional sources like steam crackers and fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) units are no longer sufficient to meet the increasing market needs [10.1016/j.cattod.2007.05.009]. PDH has become more attractive due to several economic and environmental advantages:

1. Targeted production: PDH allows for on-purpose propene production, aligning better with market demand compared to steam cracking, which favors ethylene production [10.1016/j.cattod.2007.05.009].

2. Feedstock flexibility: PDH can utilize propane from natural gas and shale gas resources, which have become increasingly abundant and cost-effective [10.1016/j.cej.2018.09.210].

3. Energy efficiency: PDH generally requires less energy than steam cracking, as it doesn't need the high temperatures for cracking larger hydrocarbons [10.1016/j.cattod.2007.05.009].

4. Reduced CO2 emissions: PDH typically results in lower CO2 emissions compared to steam cracking, contributing to a reduced environmental footprint [10.1016/j.cattod.2007.05.009].

5. Improved yield: PDH can offer higher propylene yields compared to FCC, which produces relatively small amounts of propylene [10.1016/j.cattod.2007.05.009].

However, traditional PDH faces some challenges, such as being highly endothermic, requiring high temperatures, and suffering from rapid catalyst deactivation due to coke formation [10.1007/s11244-020-01383-z]. To address these issues, oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) has emerged as a promising alternative, offering additional advantages:

1. Exothermic reaction: ODH is exothermic, potentially requiring less energy input [10.1039/D0CS01174F].

2. Lower operating temperatures: ODH can proceed at lower temperatures, reducing energy costs [10.1039/C8CC04604B].

3. Reduced coking: The presence of oxygen in ODH prevents coke formation, extending catalyst life [10.1039/C8CC04604B].

4. No equilibrium limitations: This allows for potentially higher yields [10.1039/C8CC04604B].

5. Faster reaction rates: The oxidation reaction in ODH is orders of magnitude faster than direct dehydrogenation [10.1039/C8CC04604B].

The adoption of PDH and ODH reflects the chemical industry's efforts to meet the increasing demand for propylene while addressing environmental concerns and energy efficiency requirements. It is estimated that by 2025, catalytic dehydrogenation of propane would supply approximately 30% of the global propylene production [10.1039/D0CS01174F].

※※※

Integrative understanding and prospective outlook: The evolution of propene production methods, particularly the shift towards PDH and ODH, represents a significant paradigm shift in the chemical industry. This transition not only addresses the growing demand for propene but also aligns with broader sustainability goals and energy efficiency requirements.

Looking forward, research efforts are likely to focus on further improving catalyst performance for PDH and ODH processes. This may include developing novel catalysts with higher selectivity, improved stability, and resistance to coking. Additionally, there is potential for exploring hybrid processes that combine the advantages of different production methods.

The use of CO2 as a co-feed gas in dehydrogenation processes [10.1016/j.jcat.2015.12.015] opens up exciting possibilities for carbon utilization and mitigation of greenhouse gas emissions. Future research could explore the integration of CO2 capture technologies with propene production, creating a more circular and sustainable production cycle.

As the demand for propene continues to grow, there may also be increased interest in developing bio-based routes for propene production, further reducing reliance on fossil fuel feedstocks. This could involve the development of new catalytic processes for converting bio-derived compounds into propene or its precursors.

The ongoing evolution of propene production methods highlights the dynamic nature of the chemical industry and its ability to adapt to changing economic and environmental pressures. As we move towards a more sustainable future, the lessons learned from the development of PDH and ODH technologies may inform the development of cleaner, more efficient processes for other important chemical commodities.

The adoption of PDH has been rapid, with estimates suggesting that by 2020, approximately 20% of propylene would be produced by on-purpose processes like PDH [10.1021/acs.accounts.8b00330]. This shift is driven by the limitations of traditional methods in meeting the growing demand for propene across various applications, including the production of polypropylene, propylene oxide, acrylonitrile, acrylic acid, isopropylbenzene, and butyl alcohol [10.1021/acscatal.3c00728_0].

However, challenges remain in the widespread adoption of PDH technologies. Traditional PDH processes face issues such as high energy requirements due to the endothermic nature of the reaction, equilibrium limitations, and catalyst deactivation due to coke formation [10.1007/s11244-020-01383-z]. To address these challenges, research is ongoing into improving catalysts and exploring alternative processes like oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP).

ODHP offers additional advantages, such as being exothermic, not equilibrium limited, and less prone to coke formation [10.1021/acs.accounts.8b00330]. It is estimated that moving to ODHP could result in energy savings of up to 45% compared to current production methods [10.1126/science.aaf7885]. This improvement in reaction efficiency, coupled with the high demand for propene (around 100,000 kt annually), illustrates the potential impact of ODHP if implemented on a large scale [10.1126/science.aaf7885].
