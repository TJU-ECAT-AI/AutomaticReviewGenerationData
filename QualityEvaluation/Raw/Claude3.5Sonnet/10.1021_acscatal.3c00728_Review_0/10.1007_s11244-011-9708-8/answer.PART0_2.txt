Propylene demand has been rapidly increasing in recent years, driving the search for new production methods. Propane dehydrogenation, which was commercially developed in the 1980s, has emerged as a purposeful technique for propylene production. This method has been making significant contributions to the global propylene supply in recent years.

The document does not provide specific information about the economic and environmental advantages of propane dehydrogenation. However, the fact that it is described as making "big contributions" to propylene supply suggests it may have benefits in meeting growing demand. The text does not elaborate on the versatile applications of propylene or compare propane dehydrogenation to other production methods in terms of economics or environmental impact.

近年来，丙烯的需求迅速增长，推动了新生产方法的探索。丙烷脱氢法作为一种有目的的丙烯生产技术，于20世纪80年代实现商业化。近年来，这种方法为全球丙烯供应做出了重大贡献。

文档中没有提供关于丙烷脱氢法在经济和环境方面优势的具体信息。然而，文中将其描述为对丙烯供应做出"重大贡献"，这表明它可能在满足不断增长的需求方面具有优势。文本没有详细说明丙烯的多样化应用，也没有在经济或环境影响方面将丙烷脱氢法与其他生产方法进行比较。
