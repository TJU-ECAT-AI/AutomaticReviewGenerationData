Propylene demand has been rapidly increasing in recent years, driving the search for new production methods. Propane dehydrogenation, developed commercially in the 1980s, has emerged as a significant on-purpose technique for propylene production. This method is now making substantial contributions to global propylene supply.

The literature does not provide specific information about the economic and environmental advantages of propane dehydrogenation or details about propylene's applications. However, the adoption of this method suggests it likely offers benefits in meeting growing propylene demand compared to alternative production techniques.

近年来，丙烯的需求快速增长，推动了新生产方法的探索。丙烷脱氢技术在20世纪80年代实现商业化，已成为一种重要的定向丙烯生产技术。这种方法现在对全球丙烯供应做出了重大贡献。

文献中没有提供关于丙烷脱氢的经济和环境优势的具体信息，也没有详细说明丙烯的应用。然而，这种方法的采用表明，与其他生产技术相比，它可能在满足不断增长的丙烯需求方面具有优势。
