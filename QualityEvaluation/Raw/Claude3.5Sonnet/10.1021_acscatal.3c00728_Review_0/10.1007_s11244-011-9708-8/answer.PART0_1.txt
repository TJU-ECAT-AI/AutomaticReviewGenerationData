Propylene demand has been rapidly increasing in recent years, driving the search for new production methods. Propane dehydrogenation, developed commercially in the 1980s, has emerged as a significant on-purpose technique for propylene production. This method is now making substantial contributions to the global propylene supply.

The literature does not provide specific information about the economic and environmental advantages of propane dehydrogenation. However, its growing adoption suggests it may offer benefits in meeting the rising demand for propylene across various applications more efficiently than traditional methods.
