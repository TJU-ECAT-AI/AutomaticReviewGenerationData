The significance of propene in the chemical industry has grown substantially, as evidenced by the rapidly rising demand for propylene. This increasing demand has driven the search for new propylene production techniques, with propane dehydrogenation emerging as a preferred method. Developed commercially in the 1980s, propane dehydrogenation is now making significant contributions to the global propylene supply.

While the literature does not explicitly state the economic and environmental advantages of propane dehydrogenation, it is implied that this method offers benefits in meeting the growing needs for propylene across various applications. As an "on-purpose" technique, it likely provides more control over production and potentially better efficiency compared to traditional methods. However, without more specific information from the text, we cannot definitively state the exact economic or environmental advantages of this approach.

丙烯在化工行业的重要性已大幅提升,这从丙烯需求的快速增长中可以看出。这种不断增长的需求推动了新的丙烯生产技术的研究,其中丙烷脱氢法成为首选方法。丙烷脱氢法在20世纪80年代实现商业化,现在正为全球丙烯供应做出重大贡献。

虽然文献中没有明确说明丙烷脱氢法的经济和环境优势,但暗示这种方法在满足各种应用对丙烯不断增长的需求方面提供了好处。作为一种"定向"技术,它可能提供了更好的生产控制和潜在的更高效率,相比传统方法而言。然而,由于文本中没有更具体的信息,我们无法明确说明这种方法的确切经济或环境优势。
