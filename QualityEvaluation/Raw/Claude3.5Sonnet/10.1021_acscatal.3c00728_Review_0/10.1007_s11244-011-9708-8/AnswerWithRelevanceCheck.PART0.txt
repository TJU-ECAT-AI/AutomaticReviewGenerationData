          "Recently the rapidly rising needs for propylene [13] have driven searching for new propylene production techniques."

          "Propane dehydrogenation, developed commercially in 1980s, is an on-purpose technique for propylene production and is now making big contributions to the world propylene supply in recent years [4]."

          Propene's significance in the chemical industry has evolved rapidly in recent years, with demand increasing substantially. This rising demand has driven the search for new production methods, including propane dehydrogenation. Propane dehydrogenation was developed commercially in the 1980s as an on-purpose technique for propylene production. It has since become an important contributor to the global propylene supply, helping to meet the growing needs for this versatile olefin.

          While the literature does not provide specific information about the economic and environmental advantages of propane dehydrogenation compared to other methods, its description as an "on-purpose" technique suggests it may offer more targeted and efficient production of propylene compared to traditional methods like steam cracking, which produces propylene as a by-product. The adoption of propane dehydrogenation implies it has some advantages in meeting the increasing demand, but the exact nature of these benefits is not specified in the given text.

          近年来，丙烯在化工行业的重要性迅速增长，需求量大幅上升。这种不断增长的需求推动了新生产方法的探索，其中包括丙烷脱氢。丙烷脱氢技术在20世纪80年代实现了商业化，作为一种专门生产丙烯的技术。自那时起，它已成为全球丙烯供应的重要贡献者，帮助满足这种多用途烯烃日益增长的需求。

          文献中没有提供关于丙烷脱氢相比其他方法在经济和环境方面的具体优势信息。然而，将其描述为"专门"技术表明，与传统的蒸汽裂解等将丙烯作为副产品生产的方法相比，它可能提供更有针对性和更高效的丙烯生产。丙烷脱氢技术的采用意味着它在满足不断增长的需求方面具有一些优势，但给定文本中并未具体说明这些优势的确切性质。
