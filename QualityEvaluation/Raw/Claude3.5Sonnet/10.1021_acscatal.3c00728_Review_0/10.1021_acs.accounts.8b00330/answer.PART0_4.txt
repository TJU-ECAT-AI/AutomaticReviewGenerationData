[1] "Ethylene and propylene are the most important organic feedstocks with global production capacities of 160 Mt and 110 Mt, respectively."

[2] "UOP estimates that by 2020 approximately 20% of propylene will be produced by on-purpose processes like DH."

[3] "There are several drawbacks inherent to DH that have an impact on process design. The reaction is endothermic and equilibrium limited, requiring high temperatures and low pressures to push alkane conversion to desired levels. Additionally, the two main catalysts employed in DH, CrOx/Al2O3 and PtSn/Al2O3, deactivate with time-on-stream due to severe coke deposition, which must be burned off periodically to regain activity."

[4] "A potential alternative to DH is oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH), which is exothermic, not equilibrium limited, and does not suffer from coke deposition. These differences with DH may lower capital costs due to lower operating temperatures and the avoidance of catalyst regeneration schemes."

Propene (propylene) has become increasingly significant in the chemical industry, with a global production capacity of 110 million metric tons. Its growing demand has driven the adoption of propane dehydrogenation (DH) as a preferred production method, with estimates suggesting that by 2020, about 20% of propylene would be produced by on-purpose processes like DH.

The economic advantages of propane dehydrogenation include meeting the growing demand for propylene more efficiently than traditional methods. However, DH has some drawbacks, such as being endothermic and equilibrium-limited, requiring high temperatures and low pressures. The catalysts used in DH also suffer from coke deposition, necessitating periodic regeneration.

To address these issues, oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) has emerged as a potential alternative. ODH offers several environmental and economic advantages:

1. It is exothermic, unlike DH, which is endothermic.
2. It is not equilibrium-limited.
3. It does not suffer from coke deposition.
4. It allows for lower operating temperatures.
5. It eliminates the need for catalyst regeneration schemes.

These factors contribute to potentially lower capital costs and improved operational efficiency in meeting the growing needs for propylene across various applications in the chemical industry.

丙烯在化工行业中的重要性日益增加，全球产能达到1.1亿吨。其不断增长的需求推动了丙烷脱氢(DH)作为首选生产方法的采用，估计到2020年，约20%的丙烯将通过DH等定向工艺生产。

丙烷脱氢的经济优势包括比传统方法更有效地满足日益增长的丙烯需求。然而，DH也有一些缺点，如反应吸热且受平衡限制，需要高温和低压。DH使用的催化剂还会遭受积碳沉积，需要定期再生。

为解决这些问题，氧化脱氢(ODH)作为潜在的替代方案应运而生。ODH提供了几个环境和经济优势：

1. 它是放热的，而DH是吸热的。
2. 它不受平衡限制。
3. 它不会遭受积碳沉积。
4. 它允许更低的操作温度。
5. 它消除了催化剂再生方案的需要。

这些因素有助于降低资本成本，提高运营效率，从而满足化工行业各种应用对丙烯不断增长的需求。
