[1] "Ethylene and propylene are the most important organic feedstocks with global production capacities of 160 Mt and 110 Mt, respectively."

[2] "UOP estimates that by 2020 approximately 20% of propylene will be produced by on-purpose processes like DH."

[3] "There are several drawbacks inherent to DH that have an impact on process design. The reaction is endothermic and equilibrium limited, requiring high temperatures and low pressures to push alkane conversion to desired levels. Additionally, the two main catalysts employed in DH, CrOx/Al2O3 and PtSn/Al2O3, deactivate with time-on-stream due to severe coke deposition, which must be burned off periodically to regain activity."

[4] "A potential alternative to DH is oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH), which is exothermic, not equilibrium limited, and does not suffer from coke deposition. These differences with DH may lower capital costs due to lower operating temperatures and the avoidance of catalyst regeneration schemes."

Propene's significance in the chemical industry has grown substantially, with global production capacity reaching 110 million metric tons. The increasing demand for propene is driving the adoption of propane dehydrogenation (DH) as a preferred production method, with estimates suggesting that by 2020, about 20% of propylene would be produced by on-purpose processes like DH.

The economic and environmental advantages of propane dehydrogenation in meeting the growing needs for propene include:

1. On-purpose production: DH allows for targeted propene production, helping to close the gap between supply and demand.

2. Utilization of abundant feedstock: DH takes advantage of the increased availability of propane from natural gas sources.

However, traditional DH processes have some drawbacks:

1. High energy requirements: The endothermic nature of the reaction necessitates high temperatures.
2. Equilibrium limitations: Low pressures are needed to achieve desired conversion levels.
3. Catalyst deactivation: Periodic regeneration is required due to coke deposition.

To address these issues, oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) is being explored as a potential alternative. ODH offers several advantages:

1. Exothermic reaction: Requires lower operating temperatures, potentially reducing energy costs.
2. No equilibrium limitations: Allows for higher conversion rates.
3. Reduced coking: Eliminates the need for frequent catalyst regeneration.
4. Lower capital costs: Due to lower operating temperatures and avoidance of catalyst regeneration schemes.

These advantages make ODH a promising approach for meeting the growing demand for propene in a more economical and environmentally friendly manner across various applications in the chemical industry.

丙烯在化学工业中的重要性显著增长，全球产能达到1.1亿公吨。丙烯需求的增加推动了丙烷脱氢(DH)作为首选生产方法的采用，估计到2020年，约20%的丙烯将通过DH等定向工艺生产。

丙烷脱氢在满足丙烯日益增长需求方面的经济和环境优势包括：

1. 定向生产：DH允许有针对性地生产丙烯，有助于缩小供需差距。

2. 利用丰富的原料：DH利用了来自天然气源的丙烷供应增加的优势。

然而，传统的DH工艺存在一些缺点：

1. 高能耗：反应的吸热性质需要高温。
2. 平衡限制：需要低压才能达到理想的转化水平。
3. 催化剂失活：由于焦炭沉积，需要定期再生。

为解决这些问题，正在探索氧化脱氢(ODH)作为潜在的替代方案。ODH提供了几个优势：

1. 放热反应：需要较低的操作温度，可能降低能源成本。
2. 无平衡限制：允许更高的转化率。
3. 减少结焦：消除了频繁催化剂再生的需求。
4. 较低的资本成本：由于较低的操作温度和避免催化剂再生方案。

这些优势使ODH成为在化学工业各种应用中以更经济和环境友好的方式满足日益增长的丙烯需求的有前景的方法。
