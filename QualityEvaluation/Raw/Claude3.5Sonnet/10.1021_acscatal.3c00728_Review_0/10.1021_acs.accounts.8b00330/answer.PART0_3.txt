[1] "Ethylene and propylene are the most important organic feedstocks with global production capacities of 160 Mt and 110 Mt, respectively."

[2] "UOP estimates that by 2020 approximately 20% of propylene will be produced by on-purpose processes like DH."

[3] "There are several drawbacks inherent to DH that have an impact on process design. The reaction is endothermic and equilibrium limited, requiring high temperatures and low pressures to push alkane conversion to desired levels. Additionally, the two main catalysts employed in DH, CrOx/Al2O3 and PtSn/Al2O3, deactivate with time-on-stream due to severe coke deposition, which must be burned off periodically to regain activity."

[4] "A potential alternative to DH is oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH), which is exothermic, not equilibrium limited, and does not suffer from coke deposition. These differences with DH may lower capital costs due to lower operating temperatures and the avoidance of catalyst regeneration schemes."

Propene (propylene) has become increasingly significant in the chemical industry, with a global production capacity of 110 million metric tons. Its growing demand has driven the adoption of propane dehydrogenation (DH) as a preferred production method, with estimates suggesting that by 2020, about 20% of propylene would be produced by on-purpose processes like DH.

The increasing demand for propene is driving the adoption of DH due to the limitations of traditional production methods. However, DH has its own drawbacks, including being endothermic, equilibrium-limited, and requiring high temperatures and low pressures. The catalysts used in DH also suffer from coke deposition, necessitating periodic regeneration.

Oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) is emerging as a potential alternative to DH, offering several economic and environmental advantages. ODH is exothermic, not equilibrium-limited, and doesn't suffer from coke deposition. These characteristics can lead to lower capital costs due to lower operating temperatures and the elimination of catalyst regeneration schemes. These advantages make ODH an attractive option for meeting the growing needs for propene across various applications in a more efficient and environmentally friendly manner.

丙烯在化工行业中的重要性日益增加，全球产能达到1.1亿吨。其不断增长的需求推动了丙烷脱氢(DH)作为首选生产方法的采用，据估计，到2020年，约20%的丙烯将通过DH等定向工艺生产。

由于传统生产方法的局限性，丙烯需求的增加正在推动DH的采用。然而，DH也有其自身的缺点，包括吸热反应、受平衡限制，以及需要高温和低压条件。DH使用的催化剂还会受到积碳沉积的影响，需要定期再生。

氧化脱氢(ODH)正在成为DH的潜在替代方法，提供了几个经济和环境优势。ODH是放热的，不受平衡限制，也不受积碳沉积的影响。这些特性可以降低资本成本，因为它需要较低的操作温度，并且无需催化剂再生方案。这些优势使ODH成为一个吸引人的选择，可以以更高效和环保的方式满足各种应用领域对丙烯日益增长的需求。
