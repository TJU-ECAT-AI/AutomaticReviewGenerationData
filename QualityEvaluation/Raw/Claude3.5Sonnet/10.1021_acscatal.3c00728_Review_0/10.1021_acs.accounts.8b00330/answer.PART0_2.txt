[1] "Ethylene and propylene are the most important organic feedstocks with global production capacities of 160 Mt and 110 Mt, respectively."

[2] "UOP estimates that by 2020 approximately 20% of propylene will be produced by on-purpose processes like DH."

[3] "There are several drawbacks inherent to DH that have an impact on process design. The reaction is endothermic and equilibrium limited, requiring high temperatures and low pressures to push alkane conversion to desired levels."

[4] "A potential alternative to DH is oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH), which is exothermic, not equilibrium limited, and does not suffer from coke deposition. These differences with DH may lower capital costs due to lower operating temperatures and the avoidance of catalyst regeneration schemes."

Propene (propylene) has become increasingly significant in the chemical industry, with a global production capacity of 110 million metric tons. Its growing demand has led to the adoption of propane dehydrogenation (DH) as a preferred production method, with estimates suggesting that by 2020, about 20% of propylene would be produced through on-purpose processes like DH.

The increasing demand for propylene is driving the adoption of DH due to the gap between supply from traditional cracking processes and market demand. However, DH has some drawbacks, including being endothermic and equilibrium-limited, which requires high temperatures and low pressures to achieve desired conversion levels.

As an alternative, oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) offers several economic and environmental advantages. ODH is exothermic, not equilibrium-limited, and doesn't suffer from coke deposition. These characteristics can lead to lower capital costs due to lower operating temperatures and the elimination of catalyst regeneration schemes. These benefits make ODH an attractive option for meeting the growing needs for propylene across various applications in a more efficient and potentially more environmentally friendly manner.

丙烯在化工行业中的重要性日益增长，全球产能达到1.1亿公吨。其不断增长的需求导致了丙烷脱氢（DH）作为首选生产方法的采用，估计到2020年，约20%的丙烯将通过DH等定向工艺生产。

丙烯需求的增加推动了DH的采用，这是因为传统裂解工艺的供应与市场需求之间存在差距。然而，DH存在一些缺点，包括吸热反应和平衡限制，这需要高温和低压才能达到所需的转化水平。

作为替代方案，氧化脱氢（ODH）提供了几个经济和环境优势。ODH是放热的，不受平衡限制，也不会出现积碳问题。这些特性可以降低资本成本，因为它需要较低的操作温度，并且无需催化剂再生方案。这些优势使ODH成为一个有吸引力的选择，可以更高效、可能更环保地满足各种应用中不断增长的丙烯需求。
