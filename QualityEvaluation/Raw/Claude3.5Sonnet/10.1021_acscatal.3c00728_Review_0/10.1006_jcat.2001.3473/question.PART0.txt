I'm going to give you a scientific literature. Then I'm going to ask you some questions about it. I'd like you to first write down exact quotes of parts of the document word by word that would help answer the question, and then I'd like you to answer the question using facts from the quoted content. Do not omit any relevant information from the text, and avoid introducing any falsehoods or assumptions that aren't directly supported by the literature.

Oxidative Dehydrogenation of Propane over VanadiaMagnesia Catalysts Prepared by Thermolysis of OV(OtBu)3 in the Presence of Nanocrystalline MgO
Abstract
The influence of vanadium content on the performance of VMgO catalysts for the oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of propane was investigated. High-surface-area (380 m2/g) MgO was prepared by hydrolysis of Mg(OCH3)2 followed by hypercritical drying. Vanadia was deposited on this support by thermolysis of OV(OtBu)3. Catalysts prepared by this means have BET surface areas of 187299 m2/g and apparent surface densities of V2O5 of 1.110.3 VOx/nm2. All of the catalysts were characterized by X-ray diffraction, temperature-programmed reduction, and Raman, UVvisible, and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. The environment of the V atoms depends strongly on the apparent surface density of vanadia. Isolated VO42 units are present at very low apparent surface densities (1 VOx/nm2). As the vanadia density increases, magnesium vanadate structures are formed and above a surface density of 3.5 VOx/nm2 well-dispersed magnesium orthovanadate domains become evident. The rate of ODH per V atom increases with increasing VOx surface density and reaches a maximum value at 3.5 VOx/nm2. Above this surface density, the rate of ODH per V atom decreases because an increasing fraction of the V atoms lie below the catalyst surface and, hence, are inaccessible. Consistent with this interpretation, the ODH activity per unit surface area reaches a plateau at a VOx surface density of about 4 VOx/nm2. The propane ODH selectivity of the catalysts increases with increasing VOx surface density and reaches a plateau of 80% for an apparent surface density of about 4 VOx/nm2. Rate coefficients for propane ODH (k1), propane combustion (k2), and propene combustion (k3) were calculated for each catalyst. The value of k1 increases with increasing VOx surface density, reaching a maximum at about 4 VOx/nm2. By contrast, the ratios (k2/k1) and (k3/k1) decrease monotonically with increasing VOx surface density. The observed trends in k1, (k2/k1), and (k3/k1) are discussed in terms of the surface structure of the catalyst.

First, you need to sequentially extract any quotes in the literature that are most relevant to each question, and print them in numbered order, separated by newlines. Quotes should be relatively brief. Do not attempt to summarize or answer questions at this stage, but simply repeat exactly what the corresponding part of the literature says.

Please enclose the full list of quotes in <quotes></quotes> XML tags. If there are no relevant quotes, write "No relevant quotes" instead.

Then, answer the question, starting with "Answer:".  Do not include or reference quoted content verbatim in the answer. Don't say "According to Quote [1]" when answering. Do not write reference number of quotes after answer. Put your answer to the user inside <EnglishVersionAnswer></EnglishVersionAnswer> XML tags. Output formatted text, with line breaks for each question.Separate quotes and answers with a blank line. Provide the answers to all questions in English. After completing the English answers, translate all those answers into Chinese and provide the Chinese version inside <ChineseVersionAnswer></ChineseVersionAnswer> XML tags.

Thus, the format of your overall response should look like what's shown between the <example></example> tags.  Make sure to follow the formatting and spacing exactly.
