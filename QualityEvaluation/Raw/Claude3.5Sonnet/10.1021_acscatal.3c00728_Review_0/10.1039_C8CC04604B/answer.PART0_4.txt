[3] "Direct dehydrogenation can be used by industry for the production of light olefins like ethylene, propylene, and butylenes, and so on. However, these processes are reversible and suffer from several limitations, such as, thermodynamic restriction on conversion and selectivity, strong endothermic main reaction and necessity to supply heat at high temperature, coke formation and resulting catalyst deactivation."

[4] "In contrast, oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) overcomes most of the obstacles existing in a direct dehydrogenation process. Because of the introduction of oxygen, there are no coking and equilibrium-limited problems; the reaction becomes exothermic and is able to proceed at lower temperature; furthermore, the rate of oxidation reaction is several orders of magnitude faster than that of the direct dehydrogenation."

Propene's significance in the chemical industry has grown tremendously, as light olefins (C2-C4) are now the most important feedstocks, with over 250 million metric tons produced annually. These olefins are used to create a wide range of chemicals, including polymers, oxygenates, and other derivatives.

The increasing demand for propene has driven the adoption of propane dehydrogenation (PDH) as a preferred production method. In fact, PDH has already supplied 5% of global propylene, with projections indicating this could rise to 20% by 2020. This rapid growth demonstrates the method's increasing importance in meeting propene demand.

Propane dehydrogenation offers several economic and environmental advantages over traditional methods:

1. Overcome limitations: Unlike direct dehydrogenation, which suffers from thermodynamic restrictions, high energy requirements, and coke formation, oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) addresses these issues.

2. Improved efficiency: ODH eliminates coking and equilibrium-limited problems, allowing for lower operating temperatures and faster reaction rates.

3. Energy savings: The exothermic nature of ODH reduces the need for external heat input, potentially lowering energy costs and environmental impact.

4. Higher yields: The absence of equilibrium limitations in ODH can lead to higher propene yields compared to direct dehydrogenation.

5. Reduced catalyst deactivation: By eliminating coke formation, ODH can extend catalyst life and reduce maintenance costs.

These advantages make propane dehydrogenation, particularly through ODH, an attractive option for meeting the growing demand for propene across various applications in a more economical and environmentally friendly manner.

丙烯在化工行业的重要性已经大幅增长，轻质烯烃（C2-C4）现在是最重要的原料，年产量超过2.5亿公吨。这些烯烃用于生产各种化学品，包括聚合物、含氧化合物和其他衍生物。

丙烯需求的增加推动了丙烷脱氢（PDH）作为首选生产方法的采用。事实上，PDH已经供应了全球5%的丙烯，预计到2020年这一比例可能上升到20%。这种快速增长表明了该方法在满足丙烯需求方面日益重要。

与传统方法相比，丙烷脱氢提供了几个经济和环境优势：

1. 克服局限性：与受热力学限制、高能耗和积碳形成困扰的直接脱氢不同，氧化脱氢（ODH）解决了这些问题。

2. 提高效率：ODH消除了积碳和平衡限制问题，允许在更低的操作温度下实现更快的反应速率。

3. 节能：ODH的放热性质减少了外部热输入的需求，可能降低能源成本和环境影响。

4. 更高产率：与直接脱氢相比，ODH没有平衡限制，可以获得更高的丙烯产率。

5. 减少催化剂失活：通过消除积碳形成，ODH可以延长催化剂寿命并降低维护成本。

这些优势使丙烷脱氢，特别是通过ODH，成为以更经济和环保的方式满足各种应用中日益增长的丙烯需求的有吸引力的选择。
