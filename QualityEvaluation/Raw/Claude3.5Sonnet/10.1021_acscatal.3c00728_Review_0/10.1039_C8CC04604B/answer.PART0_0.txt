) are the most important feedstocks (>250 million metric tons per year) employed in the production of a vast array of chemicals, including polymers, oxygenates, and other derivatives."

[2] "Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) has supplied 5% of global propylene, which will anticipatively increase to 20% by 2020."

[3] "Direct dehydrogenation can be used by industry for the production of light olefins like ethylene, propylene, and butylenes, and so on. However, these processes are reversible and suffer from several limitations, such as, thermodynamic restriction on conversion and selectivity, strong endothermic main reaction and necessity to supply heat at high temperature, coke formation and resulting catalyst deactivation."

[4] "In contrast, oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) overcomes most of the obstacles existing in a direct dehydrogenation process. Because of the introduction of oxygen, there are no coking and equilibrium-limited problems; the reaction becomes exothermic and is able to proceed at lower temperature; furthermore, the rate of oxidation reaction is several orders of magnitude faster than that of the direct dehydrogenation."

Propene's significance in the chemical industry has grown substantially, with light olefins like propene now being critical feedstocks for producing over 250 million metric tons of various chemicals annually. This increasing demand has driven greater adoption of propane dehydrogenation (PDH) as a production method, with PDH's share of global propylene production expected to rise from 5% to 20% by 2020.

The shift towards propane dehydrogenation offers several economic and environmental advantages compared to traditional methods. While direct dehydrogenation has limitations such as thermodynamic restrictions, high energy requirements, and catalyst deactivation due to coking, oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) addresses many of these issues. ODH eliminates coking and equilibrium limitations, operates at lower temperatures due to its exothermic nature, and offers faster reaction rates. These benefits make ODH a more efficient and potentially more cost-effective approach to meeting the growing demand for propene across various applications in the chemical industry.

丙烯在化学工业中的重要性已大幅提升，轻质烯烃(如丙烯)现已成为年产超过2.5亿吨各类化学品的关键原料。这种日益增长的需求推动了丙烷脱氢(PDH)作为生产方法的广泛采用，预计到2020年PDH在全球丙烯生产中的份额将从5%上升到20%。

相比传统方法，转向丙烷脱氢提供了几项经济和环境优势。虽然直接脱氢存在热力学限制、高能耗和因结焦导致的催化剂失活等问题，但氧化脱氢(ODH)解决了许多这些问题。ODH消除了结焦和平衡限制，由于其放热性质可在较低温度下运行，并提供更快的反应速率。这些优势使ODH成为一种更高效、潜在更具成本效益的方法，以满足化学工业各种应用对丙烯日益增长的需求。
