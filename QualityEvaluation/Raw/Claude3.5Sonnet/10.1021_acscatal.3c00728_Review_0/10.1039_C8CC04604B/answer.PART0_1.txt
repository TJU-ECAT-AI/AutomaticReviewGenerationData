[2] "Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) has supplied 5% of global propylene, which will anticipatively increase to 20% by 2020."

[3] "Direct dehydrogenation can be used by industry for the production of light olefins like ethylene, propylene, and butylenes, and so on. However, these processes are reversible and suffer from several limitations, such as, thermodynamic restriction on conversion and selectivity, strong endothermic main reaction and necessity to supply heat at high temperature, coke formation and resulting catalyst deactivation."

[4] "In contrast, oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) overcomes most of the obstacles existing in a direct dehydrogenation process. Because of the introduction of oxygen, there are no coking and equilibrium-limited problems; the reaction becomes exothermic and is able to proceed at lower temperature; furthermore, the rate of oxidation reaction is several orders of magnitude faster than that of the direct dehydrogenation."

Propene's significance in the chemical industry has grown substantially, as light olefins like propene are now crucial feedstocks for producing a wide range of chemicals, including polymers and oxygenates. The demand for propene has increased to the point where over 250 million metric tons of light olefins are used annually in chemical production.

The adoption of propane dehydrogenation (PDH) as a preferred production method for propene is driven by the increasing demand and limitations of traditional production methods. PDH has already grown to supply 5% of global propylene, with projections indicating it could reach 20% by 2020. This rapid growth demonstrates the industry's shift towards this method to meet rising demand.

The economic and environmental advantages of PDH, particularly oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH), in meeting the growing needs for propene are significant. ODH overcomes many limitations of direct dehydrogenation, such as thermodynamic restrictions, high energy requirements, and catalyst deactivation due to coke formation. By introducing oxygen into the process, ODH eliminates coking and equilibrium limitations, allows the reaction to proceed at lower temperatures, and significantly increases the reaction rate. These improvements lead to more efficient and cost-effective production, reduced energy consumption, and potentially lower environmental impact compared to traditional methods. As a result, ODH of propane presents a promising approach to sustainably meet the growing demand for propene across various applications in the chemical industry.

丙烯在化工行业的重要性已显著增长，轻质烯烃如丙烯现在是生产广泛化学品（包括聚合物和含氧化合物）的关键原料。丙烯的需求已增长到每年使用超过2.5亿公吨的轻质烯烃用于化学品生产。

采用丙烷脱氢（PDH）作为丙烯生产的首选方法是由于需求增加和传统生产方法的局限性所驱动的。PDH已经增长到供应全球5%的丙烯，预计到2020年可能达到20%。这种快速增长表明了行业为满足不断增长的需求而转向这种方法。

PDH，特别是氧化脱氢（ODH），在满足丙烯不断增长需求方面具有显著的经济和环境优势。ODH克服了直接脱氢的许多限制，如热力学限制、高能耗要求和因积碳导致的催化剂失活。通过在过程中引入氧气，ODH消除了积碳和平衡限制，允许反应在较低温度下进行，并显著提高了反应速率。这些改进导致了更高效和更具成本效益的生产，降低了能耗，并可能比传统方法具有更低的环境影响。因此，丙烷的ODH为可持续地满足化工行业各种应用中不断增长的丙烯需求提供了一种有前景的方法。
