) are the most important feedstocks (>250 million metric tons per year) employed in the production of a vast array of chemicals, including polymers, oxygenates, and other derivatives."

[2] "Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) has supplied 5% of global propylene, which will anticipatively increase to 20% by 2020."

[3] "Direct dehydrogenation can be used by industry for the production of light olefins like ethylene, propylene, and butylenes, and so on. However, these processes are reversible and suffer from several limitations, such as, thermodynamic restriction on conversion and selectivity, strong endothermic main reaction and necessity to supply heat at high temperature, coke formation and resulting catalyst deactivation."

[4] "In contrast, oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) overcomes most of the obstacles existing in a direct dehydrogenation process. Because of the introduction of oxygen, there are no coking and equilibrium-limited problems; the reaction becomes exothermic and is able to proceed at lower temperature; furthermore, the rate of oxidation reaction is several orders of magnitude faster than that of the direct dehydrogenation."

Propene's significance in the chemical industry has grown substantially, as light olefins like propene are now crucial feedstocks for producing over 250 million metric tons of various chemicals annually, including polymers and oxygenates. This increasing demand has driven the adoption of propane dehydrogenation (PDH) as a preferred production method. PDH's share in global propylene production is expected to rise from 5% to 20% by 2020, indicating its growing importance.

The shift towards propane dehydrogenation, particularly oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH), offers several economic and environmental advantages in meeting the growing needs for propene:

1. Improved efficiency: ODH overcomes limitations of direct dehydrogenation, such as thermodynamic restrictions on conversion and selectivity.

2. Lower energy consumption: ODH is exothermic and can proceed at lower temperatures, reducing the need for high-temperature heat supply.

3. Reduced catalyst deactivation: The presence of oxygen in ODH eliminates coking problems, extending catalyst life.

4. Higher reaction rates: Oxidation reactions in ODH are several orders of magnitude faster than direct dehydrogenation.

5. Better equilibrium: ODH is not equilibrium-limited, allowing for potentially higher yields.

These advantages make ODH a more sustainable and economically viable option for meeting the growing demand for propene across various applications in the chemical industry.

丙烯在化工行业的重要性已大幅提升，作为轻质烯烃，丙烯现在是生产超过2.5亿公吨各种化学品的关键原料，包括聚合物和含氧化合物。这种不断增长的需求推动了丙烷脱氢（PDH）作为首选生产方法的采用。预计到2020年，PDH在全球丙烯生产中的份额将从5%上升到20%，表明其重要性日益增加。

向丙烷脱氢，特别是氧化脱氢（ODH）的转变，在满足丙烯不断增长的需求方面提供了几个经济和环境优势：

1. 提高效率：ODH克服了直接脱氢的局限性，如转化率和选择性的热力学限制。

2. 降低能耗：ODH是放热反应，可以在较低温度下进行，减少了高温供热的需求。

3. 减少催化剂失活：ODH中氧气的存在消除了结焦问题，延长了催化剂寿命。

4. 更高的反应速率：ODH中的氧化反应比直接脱氢快几个数量级。

5. 更好的平衡：ODH不受平衡限制，可能实现更高的产率。

这些优势使ODH成为在化工行业各种应用中满足丙烯不断增长需求的更可持续和经济可行的选择。
