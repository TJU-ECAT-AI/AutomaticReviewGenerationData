Abstract
The production of ethylene and propylene through aerobic alkane oxidation without significant coproduction of CO and CO2 (COx) presents a challenge to academic and industrial researchers alike. Recently, boron-containing materials such as hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) have been identified as active and selective catalysts for the oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of propane to propylene with minimal COx selectivity. Additionally, high olefin selectivity is also obtained in the oxidation of other alkanes and other materials such as metal borides and supported B/SiO2 have been successfully applied to this transformation. Recent advances in the understanding of these catalysts in the oxidation of light alkanes are presented here providing a framework for further study of this exciting field.

1 Introduction
Ethylene and propylene are considered to be some of the most important chemical building blocks as they form the foundation of many polymers, oxygenates, and other bulk chemical intermediates. Traditionally, these light olefins are produced by cracking naphtha. In more recent years, natural gas-derived ethane has become a cheap and abundant resource for the production of feedstock chemicals and many crackers have been retrofitted or newly constructed for the cracking of ethane. As ethane cracking only produces sparing amounts of olefins heavier than ethylene [1], a gap between the supply of propylene from crackers and the demand for propylene has emerged [2]. To fill this gap, so-called on-purpose propylene production processes have been implemented such as propane dehydrogenation (PDH) which benefits from high propylene selectivity from catalysts that are typically platinum- or chromium-based [3]. However, these processes also have significant disadvantages. PDH is highly endothermic and equilibrium-limited owing to the coproduction of H2, thus high reaction temperatures are required to drive conversion. Additionally, PDH catalysts deactivate rapidly due to the deposition of carbon (coke) on the surface and capital-intensive reactor designs allowing for semi-continuous catalyst regeneration have been engineered to work around this caveat.
The oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) has been studied as an alternative to PDH and is exothermic, not equilibrium-limited, and does not require regeneration as coke deposition is inhibited by the presence of O2 within the feed [4]. These advantages may lead to lower capital and operating costs due to lower reaction temperatures and catalyst stability. Until recently, the most widely studied catalysts for ODHP were supported metal oxides like V/SiO2 [5]. They show decent selectivity to propylene, however, at industrially relevant conversions, propylene yield is compromised from over-oxidation preventing implementation [6].
In 2016, our group reported that hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) and boron nitride nanotubes (BNNTs) are active and selective catalysts for ODHP [7]. Beyond the serendipitous discovery of the reactivity displayed by supposedly inert materials, we showed that boron nitride offered higher selectivity to propylene than exhibited by previously studied catalysts. For example, hBN demonstrates a propylene selectivity of 79% at a propylene conversion of 14%, while V/SiO2 only shows a propylene selectivity of 60% at a propane conversion of 10% [8]. Additionally, the major byproduct observed in this reaction is ethylene and not COx as observed with metal oxide catalysts. We subsequently followed up on our disclosure of ODHP over hBN with the study of the ODH of n-butane and isobutane over hBN, which also demonstrated high selectivity to the corresponding olefins and displayed similar trends in kinetics as to that of ODHP [9]. Additionally, studies from other researchers demonstrate success in the ODH of ethane over hBN [10, 11]. Table 1 summarizes our results as well as those found in the literature for the ODH of light alkanes over hBN materials.

A wide array of techniques, including X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), infrared, solid-state NMR (SSNMR), and X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) revealed that upon exposure to reaction conditions, the surface of hBN becomes functionalized with oxygen to form B-O and B-OH species [7, 9, 13]. Interestingly, exposure of hBN to only air at reaction temperature does not afford surface oxidation. These findings coupled with computational investigations led us to hypothesize that the origin of activity of BN materials involved O2 activation on armchair edges [7]. However, our findings that other boron-containing materials such as B4C, NiB, WB2 among other inorganic borides are similarly selective ODHP catalysts falsified this hypothesis. Examination of these materials using XPS after reaction gave evidence in favor of a common BOx phase that emerges on the surface of each material under reaction conditions [14]. Subsequently, evaluation of fresh and used BN materials using solid-state 11B-NMR revealed that the phase generated after ODHP is an amorphous mixed boron oxide hydroxide [13].
In a previous account, we have outlined the ways in which the field of boron-based alkane oxidation catalysts had developed since its serendipitous discovery [15]. Since then, we have made further advances in the study of these materials. This contribution serves to characterize our most recent work regarding the understanding of the kinetics and mechanism of boron-catalyzed alkane oxidation and the dynamic transformation of boron materials after exposure to reaction conditions. Alongside recent work, this perspective also contains previously unpublished results. Together, these studies will inform future investigations of boron-containing catalysts.
2 Progress in Understanding Alkane Oxidation Over Boron-Containing Catalysts
2.1 Kinetics and Mechanism
Previously studied metal oxide ODH catalysts like VOx/SiO2 typically follow Mars-van Krevelen kinetics, where the rate of alkane consumption is first order with respect to Palkane and zero order with respect to PO2 [5]. However, the kinetics of ODH over boron-based materials do not follow these trends. Over hBN, the consumption of alkane (ethane, propane, n-butane, and isobutane) has been reported to be second order with respect to Palkane and follow partial order in PO2 [7, 9, 10]. Our recent work provides further insight into the kinetics and mechanism of hBN-catalyzed alkane ODH.
The determination of the influence of mass and heat transfer influence in the testing of catalysts is critical. Many studies in the literature forgo such calculations that are important in evaluating mechanistic hypotheses as they directly influence the apparent reaction kinetics. In the case of hBN, we recently examined the influence of transport phenomena in ODHP [16]. Our analytical estimates fell well within the bounds set by literature criterion for external and internal mass and heat transfer. Despite this being the case, we observed that the rate of propane consumption did not track with WBN/Fo. In fact, we saw that larger catalysts masses led to an overall lower rate of reaction per mass. Expecting that this observation may have been linked to boundary layer gradients, we anticipated that moving to smaller reactor diameters should minimize transport effects. However, we observed that 4 mm ID reactor tubes, even at a higher reaction temperature of 525 °C, showed overall lower reaction rates than the reaction performed with an 8 mm ID tube at 500 °C (Fig. 1). This evidenced that complex gas–solid interactions or gas phase chemistry have significant control over the reaction rate.

To further interrogate the origin of these unexpected trends in reactivity, SiC was employed as a inert diluent to evaluate the kinetic role of catalyst particle spacing. To eliminate the influence of catalyst mass, the mass of hBN in the catalyst bed was held constant but the amount of SiC was modulated to create the desired dilution. Unexpectedly, the increase of volume of SiC diluent in the catalyst led to a concomitant increase in the propane consumption rate. Typically, the introduction of diluent leads to better heat dissipation and less localized hot spots in a catalyst bed and thus lower reaction rates. Thus, we hypothesized that the SiC must react with reaction intermediates resulting in higher propane conversions. However, catalytic testing of SiC without hBN with both feeds of propane and propylene did not show significant reactivity. Additionally, layering of hBN over SiC (stacked bed configuration) did not lead to the same enhanced reactivity seen with homogeneously mixed diluted samples. Therefore, we proposed that the influence of increasing dilution arises from a mixed heterogeneous-homogeneous ODH mechanism occurring over boron-containing materials. Along these lines, we hypothesize that the mixed boron oxide hydroxide phase on the surface of the catalyst acts as an initiator to form alkyl radicals that further react in the gas phase.
Alkyl radical mechanisms have been studied in the past with other selective oxidation catalysts such as Li/MgO for propane ODH [17] or Mn/Na2WO4/SiO2 for the oxidative coupling of methane [18]. When the bed volume was held constant, a volcano-type dependence of the propane consumption rate as a function of hBN mass (Fig. 2). This behavior indicates that there needs to be sufficient catalyst to initiate the radical reaction, but excess hBN leads to significant chain termination events on the catalyst surface.

The selectivity of alkane oxidation over hBN is dependent upon the PO2 within the feed but mostly independent of Palkane [9]. This O2 dependence is mostly easily observed during the oxidation of n-butane, where selectivity to cracking products predominates at low PO2 (Sethylene + Spropylene > 50% at PO2 < 0.005 atm) and gives way to higher olefin selectivity at high PO2 (SC4-olefins > 50% at PO2 > 0.01 atm). Recently, we optimized the yield of cracking products in the oxidation of n-butane over hBN, as oxidative cracking of hydrocarbons may prove to be an efficient alternative to nonoxidative cracking [19]. Reduced PO2 leads to lower alkane consumption but this can be overcome at higher reaction temperatures to deliver higher yields of ethylene and propylene. We observed that the dependence of the product formation rates (and thus the selectivity) as a function of PO2 can be explained through the gas phase mechanism, as reaction with O2 compete with unimolecular alkyl radical decomposition (Fig. 3a). The formation of products was also studied over a Li2O/Dy2O3/MgO alkane cracking catalyst (Fig. 3b), which is known for significant homogeneous contributions to the reaction mechanism [17]. Nearly identical trends in the formation of products were observed over this material compared to hBN, providing further evidence for the importance of gas phase reactions in these alkane cracking systems.

There are few methods available that allow for the probing of the existence of radical species under oxidative reaction conditions at elevated temperatures. Early investigations into the mechanisms of non-catalyzed alkane decompositions under non-oxidative conditions suggested that the addition of olefins resulted in a decrease in the rate of alkane decomposition [20]. Therefore, in this previously unpublished experiment, we employed isobutene as a “radical clock” in the oxidation of n-butane under lean PO2 conditions. Isobutene, rather than another light olefin, was chosen as it is not produced in more than trace amounts in the oxidation of n-butane and therefore eases analytic measurements. Under lean PO2 conditions, where there is significant competition between unimolecular decomposition of n-butyl radicals and their reaction with O2, we observed a decrease in formation rate for all products aside from COx with increasing Pi-C4H10 (Fig. 4a). COx production initially increases at low Pi-C4H8 from combustion of isobutene but decreases at higher Pi-C4H8. Assuming that the decrease in n-butane conversion may be due to kinetic competition with isobutene, we examined isobutene consumption as a function of Pi-C4H10 (Fig. 4b). This assumption is proved false as the rate of isobutene consumption approaches a maximum as product formation continually decreases at higher Pi-C4H10. Additionally, other products such as oxygenates and heavier higher hydrocarbons were not detected in significant amounts. Therefore, olefins inhibit the radical reactions in the oxidation of alkanes over boron-containing catalysts. Ongoing research in our group is focused on identifying the mechanism of inhibition.

2.2 Active Site Hypothesis
The origin of activity on boron-based catalysts has so far remained elusive despite several studies on the subject [13, 21, 22]. As mentioned above, the initial hypothesis that armchair edges on hBN are the active site was quickly invalidated, as other boron-containing materials (e.g., B4C, WB2, NiB) exhibit the same highly selective behavior as hBN. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy of these bulk boron materials reveals a common boron oxide phase on the surface of the catalysts after reaction. Using a combination of detailed solid state NMR, microscopy, and X-ray absorption spectroscopy, we showed that a boron oxyhydroxide layer with the general formula B2(OH)xO5-x forms on the surface of hBN [13]. The goal of recent studies has been to derive the influence of specific BOx surface structures on reactivity through the use of model systems.
To study the surface boron oxide layer more closely, we synthesized a series of silica-supported boron materials with different weight loadings of B using incipient wetness impregnation with triisopropyl borate (material denoted as B/SiO2) [21]. When evaluated for propane ODH activity, B/SiO2 showed a similar product distribution to hBN but with ca. 10% lower propylene selectivity. This loss of selectivity is attributed to the SiO2 support, as the presence of 5 wt% SiO2 was also shown to have a deleterious effect on propylene selectivity over hBN. Despite slightly lower selectivity, the the reactivity of B/SiO2 confirms that oxidized boron is responsible for catalytic activity. Interestingly, the B/SiO2 materials undergo an induction period and exhibit a loss of boron content, both of which are dependent on the initial boron weight loading. We hypothesize that during the induction period, the boron species restructure and some boron is leached from the surface to generate stable and selective active species. We used a combination of transmission IR, in situ Raman and detailed SSNMR to understand the boron speciation on the fresh and spent catalysts. A summary of the proposed species on fresh and spent B/SiO2 and the corresponding method of elucidation is shown in Fig. 5. Transmission IR shows the existence of silanol (SiOH) and boronol (BOH) species on the fresh and spent materials. In situ Raman spectroscopy of the fresh B/SiO2 shows that above 100 °C, boric acid-like features condense to form six-member boroxol rings and that the condensation is reversible. These same features cannot be seen in the spent materials, which we attribute to the loss of the boroxol ring species either to leaching or restructuring to different types of boron species.

SSNMR reveals a distribution of boron species with varying numbers of hydroxyl and bridging oxide groups. The oxide groups bridge to either the surface (B-O-Si) or to other boron species (B-O-B). We denote this phase as B(OH)xO3-x/B2(OH)2xO5-x. Analysis of the spent B/SiO2 shows a shift to a higher degree of boron agglomeration, as seen in the 11B-11B double quantum-single quantum (DQ-SQ) NMR spectra, which shows boron species that are proximate to other boron species, as in chain-type metaborates. Comparison of the 11B DQ-SQ spectra for the fresh and spent materials at similar accumulation times shows a higher signal to noise ratio and a better overlap with the 11B spin echo spectrum for the spent material, indicating a higher degree of boron agglomeration (Fig. 6).

This shift to more agglomeration along with the induction period suggest that the boron oxide layer is dynamic and that it restructures under reaction conditions to generate the active site. This restructuring is in line with a recent computational study that predicts a highly dynamic boron oxide phase on the surface on hBN at 500 °C in an oxidizing atmosphere [23]. The distribution of surface species and their dynamic nature prevent the identification of a precise active site. Therefore, we seek to understand the surface requirements for active site formation through controlled synthesis.
To interrogate the significance of boron speciation in ODH, we hydrothermally synthesized borosilicate MWW (B-MWW) with 1.1 wt.% B [24]. SSNMR revealed that the majority of boron exists as isolated BO3 units fully incorporated into the framework. Despite considerable B loading, catalytic testing for propane ODH revealed that this material is not an active ODH catalyst. Post-reaction SSNMR analysis demonstrated that these boron species are stable under ODH reaction conditions and do not agglomerate as observed with supported B/SiO2. This study suggests that isolated BO3 units immobilized within a framework cannot form the active site and boron proximity achieved either through synthesis or restructuring under reaction conditions is a requirement for ODH activity.
3 Outlook
As outlined above, recent investigations have brought significant advances into both the kinetics and structure of boron-based catalysts for alkane oxidation. However, many questions still remain open and this section will describe key research areas for further understanding of boron-based catalysts.
3.1 Reaction Kinetics
Many reports on boron-based catalysts establish a second order dependence on Palkane pressure and an adsorption-type dependence on PO2. However, current studies indicate that this latter statement is inaccurate. We observe a reaction order closer to 0.25 in our latest investigations. The mischaracterization of the kinetics of ODH over boron catalysts most likely stems from the dismissal of gas phase reactions and associated kinetics owing to their complexity and the difficult nature of directly characterizing radicals in high-temperature plug-flow reactors. Future studies must include the impact of the reaction of surface-generated radicals of the contribution of alkyl radical formation and their subsequent decomposition into cracking products or reaction with gas-phase O2, as these reactions lead to the superb selectivity olefin selectivity observed. In order to develop a more accurate kinetic model, spectroscopic techniques that allow for the accurate identification of reaction intermediates must be employed, such as synchrotron vacuum ultraviolet photoionization mass spectrometry (SVUV-PIMS) [25] or laser induced fluorescence (LIF) spectroscopy [18].
3.2 Active Site Generation and Structure
hBN, metal borides, and supported boron oxide achieve high selectivity in the ODH of propane despite highly different surface compositions prior to exposure to reaction conditions. Our spectroscopic investigations into bulk and supported boron-containing catalysts indicate that there is significant restructuring that occurs under reaction conditions [13, 21]. It is not rigorously known how catalyst structure at the onset of reaction influences the types and quantities of active sites that arise after hours time-on-stream (TOS). Synthesis of well-characterized model systems with highly uniform surfaces combined with in situ spectroscopy will aid in the identification of surface structures that are precursors to active sites. Comparisons of reactivity between boron-containing catalysts must also be performed such that the influence of gas-phase chemistry is controlled, (e.g., employing equivalent catalyst bed dead volume). Ongoing studies in our group into the surface sites present during reaction include the use of diffuse reflectance Fourier transform (DRIFTS) combined with the modulation excitation spectroscopy (MES) data treatment to enhance resolution [26, 27]. This technique may aid in the identification of active sites and rate determining steps which will highlight paths to designing more active catalysts.
3.3 Catalyst Stability
The stability of boron-containing catalysts at long times-on-stream is still under question. It has been observed that hBN is stable for up to 530 h TOS in the ODH of ethane [11]. However, the hBN catalyst synthesized by Chaturbedy et al. has been shown to quickly deactivate in the ODH of propane unless catalysts are regenerated using NH3. These conflicting observations likely stem to differences in synthetic protocols which lead to samples of varying crystallinity and surface area which may alter stability. Reports of B2O3/Al2O3 catalysts showed that slight deactivation occurred owing to the leaching of B2O3 under reaction conditions [28], likely exacerbated by the melting temperature of B2O3 (Tmelt = 450 °C). In our study of B/SiO2 catalysts, we observed leaching of boron during propane ODH led to asymptotic catalyst deactivation that became steady after 24 h TOS. ICP-OES analysis of used B/SiO2 catalysts suggested that there is a stable loading of BOx at which point leaching no longer occurred under our conditions [21]. Further studies are required to identify the factors that lead to the leaching of boron-containing materials to inform the design of more stable catalysts.
4 Conclusion
Here we have described recent advances in the understanding of boron-containing catalysts for the selective oxidation of light alkanes to olefins. Unlike metal oxide alkane oxidation catalysts, the mechanism of oxidation over boron catalysts consists of a significant gas phase contribution where alkyl radicals generated by active surface BOx species undergo reaction with gas phase O2 or unimolecular decomposition. These gas phase reactions likely lead to the enhanced olefin selectivity observed and the suppression of overoxidations pathways that produce COx. The active site for ODH on these materials likely requires aggregated oxidized boron clusters but careful material synthesis combined with in situ spectroscopy are required in order to identify the active site under reaction conditions. Further investigations into both the surface and gas-phase contributions involved in the selective oxidation of alkanes to olefins over boron-containing catalysts will provide pathways for enhancing the performance of this emerging class of catalysts.
