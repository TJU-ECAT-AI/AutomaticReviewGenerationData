          [1] "Over the past decade the demand for propene has increased significantly, outgrowing the quantity that can be supplied by the conventional sources, ethane steam crackers and FCCs (fluidized catalytic crackers)"

          [2] "Consequently, the dehydrogenation of propane is becoming more attractive."

          Propene's significance in the chemical industry has grown substantially over the past decade, with demand outpacing supply from traditional sources like ethane steam crackers and fluidized catalytic crackers (FCCs). This increasing demand has made propane dehydrogenation a more attractive production method. While the literature does not provide specific information on the economic and environmental advantages of propane dehydrogenation or details about propene's various applications, it can be inferred that this method is being adopted as a preferred production method to meet the growing needs for propene that cannot be satisfied by conventional sources alone. The fact that propane dehydrogenation is becoming more attractive suggests there may be benefits to this approach in meeting growing propene needs, though these are not explicitly stated in the given text.

          在过去十年中，丙烯在化工行业的重要性显著增长，其需求已经超过了传统来源如乙烷蒸汽裂解器和流化催化裂化装置（FCCs）的供应能力。这种不断增长的需求使得丙烷脱氢成为一种更具吸引力的生产方法。虽然文献中没有提供关于丙烷脱氢的经济和环境优势的具体信息，也没有详细说明丙烯的各种应用，但可以推断，这种方法正在被采用作为首选生产方法，以满足仅靠传统来源无法满足的不断增长的丙烯需求。丙烷脱氢变得更具吸引力这一事实表明，在满足不断增长的丙烯需求方面，这种方法可能存在一些优势，尽管这些优势在给定的文本中并未明确说明。
