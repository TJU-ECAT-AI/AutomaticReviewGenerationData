The significance of propene in the chemical industry has grown substantially over the past decade, with demand outpacing supply from traditional sources like ethane steam crackers and fluidized catalytic crackers. This increasing demand has made propane dehydrogenation a more attractive production method.

The document does not provide specific information on the economic and environmental advantages of propane dehydrogenation or details about propene's various applications. However, it can be inferred that propane dehydrogenation is being adopted as a preferred production method to meet the growing demand for propene that cannot be satisfied by conventional sources alone.

在过去的十年里，丙烯在化工行业的重要性显著增长，其需求已经超过了传统来源如乙烷蒸汽裂解器和流化催化裂化装置的供应能力。这种不断增长的需求使得丙烷脱氢成为一种更具吸引力的生产方法。

文献并未提供关于丙烷脱氢的经济和环境优势的具体信息，也没有详细说明丙烯的各种应用。然而，可以推断，丙烷脱氢正在被采用作为首选生产方法，以满足仅靠传统来源无法满足的不断增长的丙烯需求。
