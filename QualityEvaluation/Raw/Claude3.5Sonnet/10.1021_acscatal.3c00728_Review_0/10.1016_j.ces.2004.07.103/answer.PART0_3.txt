The demand for propene has grown substantially over the past decade, exceeding the supply capacity of traditional production methods like ethane steam crackers and fluidized catalytic crackers (FCCs). This increased demand has made propane dehydrogenation a more attractive production method.

The literature does not provide specific information on the economic and environmental advantages of propane dehydrogenation or details about propene's applications. However, the adoption of this method is primarily driven by the need to meet the growing demand for propene that cannot be satisfied by conventional production processes.

过去十年中，丙烯的需求显著增长，超过了传统生产方法如乙烷蒸汽裂解和流化催化裂化（FCC）的供应能力。这种需求的增加使得丙烷脱氢成为一种更具吸引力的生产方法。

文献中没有提供关于丙烷脱氢的经济和环境优势，或丙烯应用的具体信息。然而，采用这种方法主要是由于需要满足传统生产工艺无法满足的不断增长的丙烯需求。
