[1] "Over the past decade the demand for propene has increased significantly, outgrowing the quantity that can be supplied by the conventional sources, ethane steam crackers and FCCs (fluidized catalytic crackers)"

[2] "Consequently, the dehydrogenation of propane is becoming more attractive."

Propene's significance in the chemical industry has grown substantially over the past decade, with demand outpacing supply from traditional sources like ethane steam crackers and fluidized catalytic crackers. This increasing demand has made propane dehydrogenation a more attractive production method.

The literature does not provide specific information on the economic and environmental advantages of propane dehydrogenation or details about propene's various applications. However, it can be inferred that this method is being adopted to meet the growing needs for propene in the industry.

在过去十年中，丙烯在化工行业的重要性显著增长，其需求量已超过了传统来源（如乙烷蒸汽裂解器和流化催化裂化装置）的供应能力。这种不断增长的需求使得丙烷脱氢成为一种更具吸引力的生产方法。

文献中没有提供关于丙烷脱氢的经济和环境优势的具体信息，也没有详细说明丙烯的各种应用。但可以推断，采用这种方法是为了满足工业界对丙烯日益增长的需求。
