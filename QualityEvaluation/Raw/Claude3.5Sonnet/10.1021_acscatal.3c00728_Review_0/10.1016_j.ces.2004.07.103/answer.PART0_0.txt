[1] "Over the past decade the demand for propene has increased significantly, outgrowing the quantity that can be supplied by the conventional sources, ethane steam crackers and FCCs (fluidized catalytic crackers)"

[2] "Consequently, the dehydrogenation of propane is becoming more attractive."

Propene's significance in the chemical industry has grown substantially over the past decade, with demand outpacing supply from traditional sources like ethane steam crackers and fluidized catalytic crackers. This increasing demand has made propane dehydrogenation a more attractive production method. The literature does not provide specific information on the economic and environmental advantages of this approach or its applications across various industries. However, it can be inferred that propane dehydrogenation offers a more direct and potentially efficient route to meet the growing propene demand compared to conventional methods.

在过去十年中，丙烯在化学工业中的重要性显著增长，其需求超过了传统来源（如乙烷蒸汽裂解器和流化催化裂化装置）的供应能力。这种不断增长的需求使得丙烷脱氢成为一种更具吸引力的生产方法。文献中没有提供关于这种方法的经济和环境优势，或其在各行业应用的具体信息。然而，可以推断，与传统方法相比，丙烷脱氢为满足不断增长的丙烯需求提供了一种更直接、可能更高效的途径。
