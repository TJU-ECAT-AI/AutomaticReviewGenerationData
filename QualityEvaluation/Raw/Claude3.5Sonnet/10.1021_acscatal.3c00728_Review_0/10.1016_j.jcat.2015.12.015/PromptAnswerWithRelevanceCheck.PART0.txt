[1] "The demand for olefins, especially propylene, is expected to increase significantly in the near future."

[2] "Steam cracking, Fluid Catalytic Cracking (FCC) and dehydrogenation (DH) are the primary methods to obtain olefins. Although these methods are commonly used to produce alkenes, they have some disadvantages: they are endothermic and suffer from the production of coke. In case of DH, alkane conversion is limited by thermodynamic constraints"

[3] "An attractive alternative to this approach is the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODP) by molecular oxygen, which enables lower reaction temperatures and more effective inhibition of surface coke formation."

The significance of propene in the chemical industry has grown, with demand expected to increase substantially in the coming years. This rising demand is driving the adoption of propane dehydrogenation as a preferred production method. While traditional methods like steam cracking, fluid catalytic cracking, and dehydrogenation are commonly used, they have drawbacks such as being endothermic and producing coke. Propane dehydrogenation offers advantages over these methods, particularly when done oxidatively. Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane allows for lower reaction temperatures and more effective prevention of surface coke formation. These benefits make propane dehydrogenation an attractive option for meeting the growing needs for propene across various applications, offering both economic and environmental advantages compared to traditional production methods.

丙烯在化学工业中的重要性日益增长，预计在不久的将来需求会显著增加。这种不断增长的需求正在推动丙烷脱氢作为首选生产方法的采用。虽然蒸汽裂解、流化催化裂解(FCC)和脱氢(DH)等传统方法常被使用，但它们存在缺点，如吸热和产生焦炭。

丙烷脱氢，特别是丙烷的氧化脱氢(ODP)，在满足这种多用途烯烃不断增长的需求方面提供了经济和环境优势。它能够在较低的反应温度下进行，并更有效地抑制表面焦炭的形成。这些优势使其成为传统方法的一个有吸引力的替代方案，可能减少能源消耗并提高过程效率。随着丙烯在各种应用中的需求持续增长，丙烷脱氢可能在满足行业需求的同时解决环境问题方面发挥越来越重要的作用。

[2] "An attractive alternative to this approach is the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODP) by molecular oxygen, which enables lower reaction temperatures and more effective inhibition of surface coke formation."

[3] "Recently, CO2 has received much attention as a co-feed gas for dehydrogenation, because CO2 can act as a mild oxidant. Unlike oxygen, CO2 will not be able to fully oxidize the catalyst to its original state due to its weak oxidation capacity. It is a thermodynamically stable and a kinetically inert molecule, and it is also cheap and abundant"

The literature indicates that propene demand is projected to grow substantially in the coming years, driving interest in propane dehydrogenation as a production method. This approach offers several advantages:

1. It allows for lower reaction temperatures compared to traditional methods.

2. It more effectively inhibits surface coke formation during the reaction process.

3. Using CO2 as a co-feed gas acts as a mild oxidant, providing benefits over using oxygen.

4. CO2 is cheap, abundant, and thermodynamically stable, making it an attractive option economically and environmentally.

5. The use of CO2 prevents full oxidation of the catalyst, potentially improving catalyst lifespan.

While not explicitly stated, these factors suggest propane dehydrogenation could offer economic and environmental benefits in meeting growing propene demand across various applications by improving reaction efficiency, reducing energy requirements, and utilizing an abundant greenhouse gas as a feedstock.

The significance of propene in the chemical industry has evolved with its increasing demand, which is expected to grow significantly in the near future. This rising demand is driving the adoption of propane dehydrogenation as a preferred production method. While steam cracking, Fluid Catalytic Cracking (FCC), and dehydrogenation (DH) are the primary methods to obtain olefins, propane dehydrogenation offers certain advantages over these traditional methods.

The economic and environmental advantages of propane dehydrogenation in meeting the growing needs for propene include:

1. Potentially lower energy requirements compared to endothermic processes like steam cracking.
2. Reduced coke production, which is a common issue with other olefin production methods.
3. More focused production of propene, as opposed to steam cracking which produces a mix of olefins.

However, it's important to note that propane dehydrogenation still faces challenges, such as thermodynamic constraints on alkane conversion. The literature does not provide specific information on the various applications driving propene demand or detailed economic comparisons between production methods.

丙烯在化学工业中的重要性随着其需求的增加而发展，预计在不久的将来会显著增长。这种不断增长的需求正在推动丙烷脱氢作为首选生产方法的采用。虽然蒸汽裂解、流化催化裂化（FCC）和脱氢（DH）是获得烯烃的主要方法，但丙烷脱氢相比这些传统方法具有一定优势。

丙烷脱氢在满足丙烯不断增长需求方面的经济和环境优势包括：

1. 与蒸汽裂解等吸热过程相比，可能具有更低的能源需求。
2. 减少焦炭生成，这是其他烯烃生产方法常见的问题。
3. 更专注于丙烯的生产，而不像蒸汽裂解那样产生混合烯烃。

然而，需要注意的是，丙烷脱氢仍面临挑战，如烷烃转化的热力学限制。文献中没有提供关于推动丙烯需求的各种应用的具体信息，也没有详细的生产方法经济比较。
