[1] "The demand for olefins, especially propylene, is expected to increase significantly in the near future."

[2] "Steam cracking, Fluid Catalytic Cracking (FCC) and dehydrogenation (DH) are the primary methods to obtain olefins. Although these methods are commonly used to produce alkenes, they have some disadvantages: they are endothermic and suffer from the production of coke."

[3] "An attractive alternative to this approach is the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODP) by molecular oxygen, which enables lower reaction temperatures and more effective inhibition of surface coke formation."

The demand for propylene is expected to increase significantly in the near future, driving the adoption of propane dehydrogenation as a production method. Traditional methods like steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking have disadvantages, being endothermic and producing coke. Propane dehydrogenation offers economic and environmental advantages by enabling lower reaction temperatures and more effectively inhibiting coke formation. This makes it a more attractive option for meeting the growing demand for propylene across various applications in the chemical industry.
