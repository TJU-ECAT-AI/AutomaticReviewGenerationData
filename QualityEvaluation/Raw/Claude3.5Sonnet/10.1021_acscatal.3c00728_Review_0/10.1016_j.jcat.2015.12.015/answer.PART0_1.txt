[1] "The demand for olefins, especially propylene, is expected to increase significantly in the near future."

[2] "Steam cracking, Fluid Catalytic Cracking (FCC) and dehydrogenation (DH) are the primary methods to obtain olefins. Although these methods are commonly used to produce alkenes, they have some disadvantages: they are endothermic and suffer from the production of coke."

[3] "An attractive alternative to this approach is the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODP) by molecular oxygen, which enables lower reaction temperatures and more effective inhibition of surface coke formation."

The significance of propene in the chemical industry has grown, with demand expected to increase significantly in the near future. This increasing demand is driving the adoption of propane dehydrogenation as a preferred production method. While traditional methods like steam cracking, Fluid Catalytic Cracking (FCC), and dehydrogenation (DH) are commonly used, they have disadvantages such as being endothermic and producing coke.

Propane dehydrogenation, particularly oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODP), offers economic and environmental advantages in meeting the growing needs for this versatile olefin. It enables lower reaction temperatures and more effectively inhibits surface coke formation. These benefits make it an attractive alternative to traditional methods, potentially reducing energy consumption and improving process efficiency. As the demand for propene continues to grow across various applications, propane dehydrogenation is likely to play an increasingly important role in meeting industry needs while addressing environmental concerns.

丙烯在化学工业中的重要性日益增长，预计在不久的将来需求会显著增加。这种不断增长的需求正在推动丙烷脱氢作为首选生产方法的采用。虽然蒸汽裂解、流化催化裂解(FCC)和脱氢(DH)等传统方法常被使用，但它们存在缺点，如吸热和产生焦炭。

丙烷脱氢，特别是丙烷的氧化脱氢(ODP)，在满足这种多用途烯烃不断增长的需求方面提供了经济和环境优势。它能够在较低的反应温度下进行，并更有效地抑制表面焦炭的形成。这些优势使其成为传统方法的一个有吸引力的替代方案，可能减少能源消耗并提高过程效率。随着丙烯在各种应用中的需求持续增长，丙烷脱氢可能在满足行业需求的同时解决环境问题方面发挥越来越重要的作用。
