The role of CO2 in the dehydrogenation of propane over WOxVOx/SiO2
Highlights
•
CO2 oxidizes V2O3 to V2O4 and participates in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane.
•
Oxidative dehydrogenation accompanied by RWGS and non-oxidative dehydrogenation.
•
CH bond activation is rate-limiting; catalyst re-oxidation with CO2 is faster.
Abstract
A series of WOxVOx catalysts supported on porous silica, with W/V molar ratios between 0 and 0.6, are examined for propane dehydrogenation in the presence and absence of CO2 from 500 C to 600 C and at atmospheric pressure. Catalysts characterization using temperature programmed reduction (H2-TPR), temperature programmed oxidation (CO2-TPO), Raman spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction and transmission electron microscopy shows that the combination of the two metal components allows retention of VOx dispersion during the reaction.
CO2 has the ability to oxidize V2O3 to V2O4 and participates in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propylene. When the reaction is carried out with D2 present in the feed together with C3H8 and CO2 (D2:C3H8:CO2 = 1:1:1), only 45% of the resulting water contains D2O. This confirms that the reaction follows the oxidative dehydrogenation route of propane but is also accompanied by the reverse water gas shift reaction in combination with the non-oxidative dehydrogenation route. Moreover, one of the major roles of CO2 is the suppression of the formation of surface carbon. A partially reduced vanadia dimer was used to represent the active site and density functional theory (DFT) calculations were performed. This allowed to confirm that propane dehydrogenation in the presence of CO2 can proceed simultaneously via direct oxidative dehydrogenation and non-oxidative dehydrogenation followed by the reverse water gas shift reaction. According to the DFT-calculated Gibbs free energy profile at 600 C, the activation of the secondary CH bond of propane (EDFT,act = 158 kJ/mol) is rate-limiting, while re-oxidation of the catalyst with CO2 is potentially much faster.
The catalyst with a W/V = 0.1 M ratio has the highest C3H6 average turnover frequency but higher selectivities were obtained with W/V = 0.6. In agreement with the value predicted from DFT, the experimental apparent activation energy for all investigated W/V ratios is similar and varies from 127  11 kJ/mol to 147  12 kJ/mol with W/V molar ratios between 0 and 0.6.

1. Introduction
The demand for olefins, especially propylene, is expected to increase significantly in the near future. Steam cracking, Fluid Catalytic Cracking (FCC) and dehydrogenation (DH) are the primary methods to obtain olefins. Although these methods are commonly used to produce alkenes, they have some disadvantages: they are endothermic and suffer from the production of coke. In case of DH, alkane conversion is limited by thermodynamic constraints
[1]
,
[2]
,
[3]
,
[4]
,
[5]
.
An attractive alternative to this approach is the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODP) by molecular oxygen, which enables lower reaction temperatures and more effective inhibition of surface coke formation. The primary drawback of this process is a low propylene selectivity due to total oxidation of propane and propylene at high conversion. Thus there is an ongoing search for a selective catalyst in this process.
Vanadium oxide is considered to be one of the most important compounds in metal oxide catalysis
[6]
,
[7]
,
[8]
,
[9]
. The catalytic activity and selectivity of vanadium oxide for oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) depends on its structure, dispersion and the characteristics of its supporting material. The most active catalytic form for this type of reaction is the monomeric, isolated VOx species. The oxygen of the VO (=vanadyl) group of this isolated VOx is responsible for the ODH of propane to propylene and is also selective for propylene formation
[10]
,
[11]
,
[12]
,
[13]
. The presence of bulk V2O5 on the other hand decreases the selectivity and favors total oxidation. At this point the best reported performance of a VOx/SiO2 catalyst is a yield of 30%
[14]
.
Improvement in this yield is possible with the addition of WOx. It has been reported that tungsten oxide influences the dispersion of VOx and improves the abundance of moderately distorted vanadium oxide species
[15]
,
[16]
. Alternatively, it has been suggested that the promoting effect of tungsten oxide could also be beneficial for the WOxVOx/SiO2 catalyst by inhibiting the strong tendency for island formation of VOx and by interacting with neighboring vanadium oxide species. The WOx hinders the compression of vanadium oxide species from tetrahedral, isolated species to oligomer, polymer or bulk V2O5
[9]
,
[17]
. The interaction between neighboring tungsten and vanadium oxides can also favor the reduction of VOx, which is further beneficial to the dehydrogenation performance
[17]
,
[18]
.
Recently, CO2 has received much attention as a co-feed gas for dehydrogenation, because CO2 can act as a mild oxidant. Unlike oxygen, CO2 will not be able to fully oxidize the catalyst to its original state due to its weak oxidation capacity. It is a thermodynamically stable and a kinetically inert molecule, and it is also cheap and abundant
[19]
,
[20]
,
[21]
,
[22]
. Moreover, because of its high heat capacity, using CO2 as a co-feed can alleviate the effects of the exothermal ODP reaction, avoiding hot spots that can lead to cracking of the alkane
[21]
,
[23]
.
Utilization of carbon dioxide in some partial oxidation reactions, such as CO2 reforming of methane and oxidative coupling of methane has already been reported

based materials are most frequently reported in the field of propane dehydrogenation by CO2. However, the role of CO2 in oxidative dehydrogenation and the mechanism of this reaction remain unclear and are dependent on the nature of the catalyst and its supporting material.
When using chromium or vanadium oxide based catalysts, CO2 can re-oxidize partially reduced metal oxides. It is generally accepted that it follows a proposed pathway which is in agreement with the Mars-Van Krevelen mechanism
[39]
, but DH can occur simultaneously with the ODH reaction. For gallium and indium based catalysts, the promoting effect of CO2 is related to its enhancing effect on the removal of coke, the Boudouard reaction, and the reverse water gas shift (RWGS) reaction. Carbon dioxide can eliminate the hydrogen produced by non-oxidative dehydrogenation reactions by the RWGS. Coupling of the reverse water gas shift reaction with DH therefore improves the equilibrium conversion in these DH reactions toward propylene production
[19]
,
[21]
. A thermodynamic analysis of propane dehydrogenation with carbon dioxide was performed using the constrained Gibbs free energy minimization method
[40]
. The influences of the CO2/C3H8 molar ratio, temperature and pressure on equilibrium conversion and product composition were examined. In the presence of CO2 with a molar ratio of CO2/C3H8 = 1, the temperature of dehydrogenation can be 50 C lower than that of simple dehydrogenation to achieve 60% conversion of propane at 650 C. It was found that the occurrence of dry reforming of propane and coke forming side reactions could strongly impact the equilibrium product composition of the multireaction system and, therefore, these reactions should be kinetically controlled
[40]
.
Nevertheless, CO2 assisted propane dehydrogenation with the use of vanadium oxide based catalysts remains poorly understood. Herein we report on the dynamic behavior of the WOxVOx-based catalyst and have examined the role of CO2 and the effects of tungsten on its catalytic activity, selectivity toward propylene, structural characteristics of the catalyst and coke formation. Moreover, density functional theory (DFT) calculations were performed to elucidate the reaction mechanism of propane dehydrogenation in the presence and in the absence of CO2.
2. Experimental procedures
2.1. Catalyst preparation
Catalysts were prepared via the incipient wetness method. Silicagel (Kieselge l60, Sigma Aldrich) was impregnated with an aqueous solution of ammonium metavanadate (>99% NH4VO3, Sigma Aldrich) and ammonium tungstate (99.99% [NH4]10H2[W2O7]6, Sigma Aldrich). A molar equivalent of oxalic acid dihydrate (99%, Chimica Janssen) was added to the solution to increase the solubility of the ammonium metal complexes. The impregnated molar concentration of ammonium metavanadate in the impregnated solution (0.75 mL/g) remained 2 mmol/0.75 mL, while the concentration of the ammonium tungstate varied from 0.2, 0.6 to 1.2 mmol/0.75 mL. After impregnation, the powders were vacuum dried overnight at room temperature. Finally, the powders were dried in a furnace at 100 C for 6 h and subsequently calcined in air at 600 C for 6 h with a heating rate of 4 K/min. The bulk chemical composition of the tested catalysts (see
Table 1
) was determined by means of inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectrometry (ICP-AES) (IRIS Advantage system, Thermo Jarrell Ash). The investigated catalysts contain approximately the same amount of vanadium (ca. 3.5 wt.% V) and are denoted based on their weight percentage of tungsten as 0WV (0 wt.% W), 1.5WV (1.5 wt.% W), 4.5WV (4.5 wt.% W), and 6.8WV (6.8 wt.% W).

Sample W V

0WV   3.2 0.63
1.5WV 1.5 0.08 3.4 0.67
4.5WV 4.5 0.25 4.1 0.81
6.8WV 6.8 0.37 3.3 0.65
2.2. Catalyst characterization
Crystallographic analysis of the tested catalysts was performed by means of X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements in θ2θ mode using an ARL XTRA Diffractometer (Thermo Scientific) apparatus with lynx eye detector covering 3 and 192 channels over the range 560 with a step of 0.02. Raman analysis of the samples was performed on a RXN1 Raman spectrometer (Kaiser Optical Systems) fitted with a 532 nm laser operating at 40 mW. H2-TPR measurements were carried out in a U-shaped quartz reactor with 50 mg of catalyst. The temperature was increased to 800 C at a rate of 10 K/min. Microscopy High-Resolution Transmission Electron Microscopy (HRTEM), Bright Field (BF) and Dark Field (DF) Scanning Transmission Electron Microscopy (STEM BF) were used for structural analysis. Energy Dispersive X-ray spectrometry (EDX) was used for local chemical analysis. These techniques were implemented using a JEOL JEM-2200FS, Cs-corrected microscope operated at 200 kV, which was equipped with a Schottky-type field-emission gun (FEG) and EDX JEOL JED-2300D. All samples were deposited by immersion of the catalyst onto a lacey carbon film on a copper support grid.
In view of obtaining information regarding the average oxidation state of the catalyst, a chemical method was applied to the catalysts using redox titration. Starting from the as prepared sample, this procedure includes the following steps: (1) catalyst reduction with 5%H2/Ar at 600 C followed by re-oxidation with O2 or CO2 and (2) second isothermal reduction with hydrogen (5%H2/Ar, 600 C) to determine the amount of exchangeable oxygen in the O2 or CO2 pretreated catalyst.
An ex situ XPS study of several vanadium oxides catalysts was performed to try and identify clearly the different oxidation states present on the surface of these oxides. The amount of V and W in the samples is small and thus only small peaks could be observed in XPS (
Figs. S1S3
), even after prolonged measuring times. Peak positions were determined using Casa XPS software, Shirley background subtraction and mixed GaussianLorentzian peaks. However, the ex situ nature of these measurements does not allow the determination of the oxidation state of the catalyst during reaction conditions.
2.3. Catalytic tests
Catalytic tests were performed at atmospheric pressure in a quartz tube microreactor with an internal diameter of 10 mm, which was housed inside an electric furnace (Autochem II 2920, Micromeritics equipped with a TCD detector). Typically, 50 mg of sample was packed between quartz wool plugs. The temperature of the catalyst bed was measured with K-type thermocouples touching the outside and inside of the reactor at the position of the catalyst bed. The inlet gas flow rates were controlled using Brooks mass flow controllers. The feed and product gas streams were monitored online using a calibrated OmniStar Pfeiffer Mass Spectrometer. MS signals were recorded for all major fragments of C3H8, C3H6, C2H6, and C2H4. 29 amu was the most intense fragment of C3H8, while its contribution for C2H6 and C2H4 was minor, as verified by additional control experiments. For experiments reported in this manuscript, the appropriately scaled 29 amu signal (based on the C3H8 fragmentation ratios tabulated in the NIST database) was subtracted from the 2728 amu signals. The remaining 2728 amu signals and the 26 amu signal were not significant within experimental error, which led us to conclude that C2 formation is negligible in our experiments. The 41 amu signal was used to follow C3H6 while the 16 amu signal was used to follow CH4. The carbon balance was verified using Ar as an internal standard and accounting for deposited carbon a maximum deviation of 15% was obtained.
The reaction temperature was limited to 600 C because above that temperature non-catalytic reactions were observed. Kinetic measurements were conducted at Wcat/FC3H8,0 = 44.8 kgcat s mol1 and PC3H8,0 = 5 kPa (1 N ml/s of 5 vol.% C3H8/He mixture). Three types of experiments were performed. In the first type of experiments, the sample was oxidized in 1 N ml/s flow of 20% O2/N2 at 600 C for 0.5 h. Then, at reaction temperature the reactor was purged with He for 5 min and a catalytic measurement was performed. In the second type of experiments, the sample was reduced at 600 C for 5 min by 5% H2/Ar. After purging with helium for 5 min, 1 N ml/s of 20 vol.% CO2/He was introduced to re-oxidize the catalyst and a catalytic test was conducted. In the third type of experiments, a mixture of C3H8 and CO2 was fed into the reactor. After activity measurements, the reactor was purged with helium, and 1 N ml/s of 20% O2/He was introduced in order to burn off carbon deposits until the CO2 signal returned to the baseline.
Experiments were repeated three times with as prepared sample material in order to obtain standard deviations. The average turnover frequency (TOF, mol s1 molVOx1) was calculated from the difference in the inlet and outlet molar flow rates, as measured relative to an internal standard (Ar) using an online quadrupole mass spectrometer, i.e.

with Fi the molar flow rate of component i (mol s1), and NVOx,s the amount of exposed (surface) VOx atoms in the sample (molVOx,s). The conversion of propane is calculated as
(2)
with FC3H8,0 and FC3H8 (mol s1) the propane inlet and outlet molar flow rate.
The isotopic labeling experiments were performed with 600 C as a standard temperature and a total flow rate of 1 N ml/s. D2 was co-fed with C3H8 and CO2 with D2:C3H8:CO2 = 1:1:1 ratio. D2 gas (99.9% isotopic purity) was obtained from SigmaAldrich.
3. Computational procedures
Density functional theory (DFT) cluster calculations have been performed with Gaussian 09
[41]
, using the B3LYP functional
[42]
and triple-ζ plus polarization basis sets
[43]
(TZVP) on all atoms. All atoms were allowed to relax during geometry optimization, while the optimized structures were characterized as minima or transition states by frequency calculations. The Gibbs free energy for all structures was calculated using statistical thermodynamics
[44]
. The partition functions for the gas-phase species included vibrational, rotational and translational degrees of freedom, while only the vibrational contributions were taken into account for the surface species.
4. Results and discussions
4.1. Catalyst characterization
XRD measurements were performed to determine whether metal clusters and thus crystalline V2O5 and WO3 were present in the samples (
Fig. 1
). As shown in
Table 1
, the catalysts contain a similar V-loading and only differ in the amount of impregnated tungsten oxide. XRD shows no significant diffractions attributed to bulk V2O5 for any sample, although the presence of crystalline clusters, smaller than 3 nm, cannot be excluded based on XRD. When the loading of tungsten oxide increases, two distinct diffraction lines arise at 2θ = 24 and 2θ = 34 which is a strong indication that crystalline monoclinic WO3 was formed. Similar observations have been observed in the literature
[45]
,
[46]
. For 1.5WV, the sample with the lowest amount of tungsten, no WO3 diffractions can be detected. This suggests that WOx is either dispersed on the surface or that the WO3 crystallites are too small to be detected. The broad peak between 2θ = 2030 originates from the amorphous silica supporting material
[10]
. After catalysis and subsequent re-oxidation, a similar XRD diffractogram was observed.

H2-TPR was carried out to investigate the reducibility of vanadium oxide surface species deposited on the SiO2 support. Comparing the H2-TPR profiles of bulk V2O5 and 0WV sample, shown in
Fig. 2
, the reduction profile for bulk V2O5 exhibits two major peaks at 660 C and 790 C while for 0WV only one signal at 580 C can be observed. Similar observations on the reduction of bulk V2O5 were reported by Shee and Deo
[47]
. The presence of multiple peaks is attributed to the reduction of V2O5 to V2O3 through the intermediate formation of oxide species with different oxidation states according to the following sequence:

The symmetrical signal at 580 C for the 0WV sample indicates the presence of VOx in its isolated, monomeric form
[11]
,
[48]
.
The effect of the amount of WOx on the reducibility of the VOx species is shown in the inset of
Fig. 2
. H2-TPR shows a small increase in the H2 consumption by vanadium oxide for the WOxVOx/SiO2 impregnated samples in comparison with the 0WV sample. Oxidation of the H2 by WO3 does not take place in this temperature range
[17]
. The position of the peak remains unchanged and is approximately 580 C, indicating the reduction of amorphous monomeric VOx surface species and that the reducibility of all the samples remains the same.
STEM images (
Fig. 3
) show that the WO3 species remain rather dispersed, for the lowest loading, and subsequently begin to cluster into larger particles with increasing loading of tungsten. The largest particles are estimated to have a size of 30 nm. It has been previously reported that thermal treatment at an elevated temperature of 500 C results in the coalescence of grafted WOx species to form WO3 clusters of 10 nm
[46]
. In this case, the calcination procedure is mainly responsible for the WO3 crystal growth seen in
Fig. 3
(b) and (c). The STEM image of the sample with the lowest tungsten loading, i.e.
Fig. 3
(a), shows that here the WO3 crystals are better dispersed on the mesoporous silica supporting material.

Raman spectroscopy was performed to study the structural properties of the catalysts. The Raman spectrum in
Fig. 4
(a) shows that no bulk V2O5 (995 cm1) was formed on the silica surface for any sample. The signal at 1035 cm1 is generally attributed to the vanadium oxide species. This signal indicates that VOx is present in its mono-vanadyl (VO) form on the surface of the porous silica supporting material
[12]
,
[49]
. If V2O5 crystallites would have been formed, this VO signal would be shifted toward 995 cm1
[18]
. Every sample contains a signal at 487 cm1, which correlates with the amorphous silica supporting material
[50]
. Around 800 cm1, two features overlap. There is a Si-O-Si symmetrical stretch at 800 cm1 that is present in all samples, but for the samples containing higher loadings of WOx (spectra 3 and 4 in
Fig. 4
(a)), another feature emerges at 800 cm1 that is assigned to the presence of bulk WO3
[17]
,
[51]
. This is also confirmed by the XRD diffractograms of the samples.

To obtain information concerning the role of tungsten in retaining VOx in a dispersed state, Raman spectra were also measured after a reaction followed by a re-oxidation process. During the re-oxidation step, the catalysts were calcined in air at 500 C with a heating rate of 4 K/min for a period of 6 h. Comparing the Raman spectra of the as-prepared (see
Fig. 4
(a)) and re-oxidized (see
Fig. 4
(b)) catalysts, it is clear that the WOx-containing catalysts maintain VOx in a highly dispersed state. The sample without the WOx presented (spectrum 1) shows much broader peaks and a shift toward 995 cm1, indicating the start of bulk V2O5 formation. This is expected since VOx species have the tendency to cluster on silica surfaces during high temperature treatments
[52]
.
5. Propane dehydrogenation
5.1. O2 pre-oxidized catalysts
The observed relaxation to a steady-state corresponds to variations in the chemical or phase composition of the surface under the effect of the reaction conditions and can be called extrinsic relaxation
[53]
. Two different start-up conditions were used i.e. O2 or CO2 pretreated catalyst. Representative results of relaxation experiments at 600 C on a O2 pretreated catalyst are depicted in

a and d shows the H2O MS signal vs. time on stream.
The catalytic performance of the 0WV catalyst, i.e. without WOx, was examined in order to establish the catalytic properties. In
Fig. 5
(a), the average turnover frequencies of propylene, hydrogen, and carbon dioxide, which are the only detectable products, are shown as function of time on-stream. In the initial state of reaction, the catalyst is fully oxidized and oxidative dehydrogenation proceeds through the redox mechanism by reduction of V5+ to V3+ combined with C3H6 and CO2 formation (Eqs.
(3)
,
(4)
). As stated in the introduction, the formation of C3H6 and the unwanted CO2 proceeds via different mechanisms on different surface oxygens in vanadium oxide. During the relaxation period, the formation of carbon dioxide passes through a maximum and completely disappears after 120 s. The propylene average turnover frequency monotonically increases toward a steady-state value of 8.3 mmol/s/molVOx after 60 s. Beyond 180 s, the average turnover frequency of hydrogen increases systematically to reach 24.9 mmol/s/molVOx. The amount of hydrogen is higher than that of propylene at any time during the reaction. Since the oxidation of V3+ cannot proceed after this stage, only non-oxidative dehydrogenation is possible over these reduced sites according to Eq.
(5)
(steady state dehydrogenation):
(3)
(4)
(5)
Experimental data for the WOx-containing catalysts,
Fig. 5
(bd), show similar trends, but there are pronounced differences with increasing WOx loading in the catalysts. The average turnover frequency of both carbon dioxide and hydrogen decreases compared to the catalyst containing no WOx, i.e. the 0WV sample. Propylene generation begins increasing earlier and reaches a higher steady-state value up to 13.3 mmol/s/molVOx for the 1.5WV sample. The 6.8WV catalyst shows the highest initial selectivity toward propylene, i.e. less carbon dioxide formation. Like carbon dioxide, water formation passes through a maximum and then, completely disappears after 80 s (
Fig. 5
d). This can be attributed to the same oxygen storage capacity of the samples. Since non-selective bulk V2O5 is not present in the promoted catalysts (see
Fig. 4
), the carbon dioxide yield was five times smaller compared to the non-promoted catalyst. The amount of hydrogen produced by all WOx promoted catalysts was less than the amount of propylene produced during the initial 90 s of the experiments. However, after this relaxation period, the average turnover frequency of hydrogen production for all promoted samples was higher than the propylene production. This can be attributed to dehydrogenation reactions that are accompanied by complete propane dehydrogenation to surface carbon and hydrogen (Eq.
(6)
.

After the catalytic test, the reactor was purged with helium, and 1 N ml/s of 20% O2/He was introduced in order to burn off carbon deposits from the catalysts. The quantity of carbon in mmolC/molVOx deposited on the catalyst after reaction (
Fig. 6
) was more than three times lower for the tungsten promoted catalysts.

5.2. CO2 pre-oxidized catalysts
After reduction of WOxVOx/SiO2 with 5% H2/Ar at 600 C followed by re-oxidation with O2 or CO2, the isothermal reduction profiles show an intense H2 consumption peak attributed to the reduction of V2O5 to V2O3
[54]
,
[55]
. The reduction profiles for 1.5WV are shown in
Fig. 7
. The amount of oxygen present in the O2 oxidized catalyst was 1.9 mol/molVOx. This result is close to the theoretical amount of available oxygen for reduction of V5+ to V3+. When the catalyst is reduced, and subsequently re-oxidized with CO2 instead of O2 at the same temperature, the H2 consumption peak is about 0.86  0.13 mol/molVOx which is 45  7% of that of the samples that have been oxidized by O2. This clearly indicates that less than half of the exchangeable oxygen is regenerated by CO2, which can be attributed to the oxidation of V2O3 into V2O4 instead of V2O5. Reduction of WO3 by H2 does not take place under these experimental conditions.

In order to avoid the effects of surface carbon on catalyst activity, kinetic measurements of propane dehydrogenation over CO2 re-oxidized catalysts were performed after reduction of the as prepared catalysts by 5% H2/Ar for 10 min at 600 C and catalyst re-oxidation in 20% CO2/He.
Representative results of extrinsic relaxation measurements at 600 C are depicted in
Fig. 8
. The average turnover frequencies of propylene and hydrogen are shown as a function of time-on-stream. The propylene yield monotonically increased toward a steady-state value after 40 s for all catalysts. Beyond 180 s, the yield of hydrogen systematically increased. The amount of hydrogen at any time during the reaction was higher than the propylene yield for the VOx unpromoted catalyst. The amount of hydrogen produced by all promoted WOx catalysts was less than the propylene yield during the initial 40 s period of the experiments. Compared to the unpromoted catalyst at the same time-on-stream (i.e. 40 s), the amount of hydrogen produced by the promoted catalysts decreased from 13 mmol/s/molVOx to 9.9 mmol/s/molVOx for 1.5WV, to 8.1 mmol/s/molVOx for 4.8WV, and to 5.3 mmol/s/molVOx for 6.8WV. Carbon dioxide was not observed in all cases. Water formation passed through a maximum and then completely disappeared after 80 s (

d). This can be explained by the fact that initially the catalyst is partially oxidized and that selective oxidative dehydrogenation is accompanied by non-oxidative dehydrogenation. Furthermore, the absence of CO2 as a product clearly shows that only selective surface oxygen was formed after catalyst reoxidation by carbon dioxide.

Following catalytic experiments, the carbon deposits were burnt off from the catalysts. The amount of carbon in mmolC/molVOx deposited on the catalyst after the reaction was approximately the same as for the O2 oxidized catalysts (see
Fig. 6
).
5.3. In the presence of CO2
The effect of the presence of CO2 in the gas phase on propane dehydrogenation was also investigated in order to clarify the contribution of CO2 to the reaction. The average turnover frequencies of propylene, hydrogen, carbon monoxide and water, which are the only detectable products, are shown in
Fig. 9
(a) as function of time-on-stream for the 6.8WV sample. During the relaxation period, C3H6 passed through a maximum and then reached a steady-state value of 10.4 mmol/s/molVOx after 450 s. The yield of hydrogen increased systematically reaching 3.7 mmol/s/molVOx after 30 min. The amount of produced carbon monoxide was equal to propylene only in the initial 100 s period of reaction before decreasing to 9 mmol/s/molVOx. Water formation monotonically increased and reached a steady-state value. Clearly, CO and H2O are produced from CO2 and C3H8 during oxidative dehydrogenation via a redox mechanism

[56]
. In this case, the amount of propylene and carbon monoxide must be equal. On the other hand, reaction of H2 and CO2 (RWGS) could also be responsible for CO formation (Eq.
(7)
). Hydrogen can be produced by non-oxidative dehydrogenation of propane as discussed above (see

(a) Average turnover frequency for C3H6, CO and H2 (TOF, mol s1 molVOx) versus time-on-stream for CO2 assisted propane dehydrogenation at 600 C (Wcat/FC3H8,0 = 44.8 kgcat s mol1 and PC3H8,0 = 5 kPa PCO2,0 = 20 kPa at a total pressure of 101.3 kPa) over CO2 re-oxidized 6.8WV catalyst. Inset shows the H2O MS signal vs. time on stream. (b) The amount of carbon in mmolC/molVOx deposited on the catalyst at different times on stream. (The error bar indicates 95% confidence interval.)
In order to investigate the catalytic properties of the 6.8WV catalyst in a RWGS reaction, experiments were performed while feeding a gaseous mixture containing 20% CO2 and 20% H2 in the He flow. The reaction of propane dehydrogenation was performed first in order to obtain reduced vanadium oxide, and then the CO2 and H2 mixture was fed to the catalyst. The conversion of CO2 and H2 was 28%, which confirms a high activity of the catalyst in a RWGS reaction.
Therefore, it cannot be excluded that propylene is produced by non-oxidative dehydrogenation (Eq.
(5)
)
[31]
,
[57]
,
[58]
and that the formation of CO and H2O is a result of the RWGS reaction (Eq.
(7)
). In order to understand the origin of water formation, D2 was co-fed with C3H8 and CO2. This experiment was carried out at 600 C with a D2:C3H8:CO2 = 1:1:1 ratio. Only 45% of the resulting water contained D2O under these experimental conditions, supporting the idea that in the case of dehydrogenation of C3H8 in the presence of carbon dioxide, interaction of surface oxygen with propane occurs. Thus, the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane over the WV catalyst in the presence of CO2 is accompanied by the RWGS reaction. The amount of carbon deposited on the catalyst after reaction with a mixture of CO2 and C3H8 at the different reaction times depicted in
Fig. 9
(b) is three times less than that which is deposited after reaction with only C3H8 for the same time on stream. This result strongly suggests that one of the major roles of the CO2 is suppression of surface carbon formation on the catalyst. The reaction rate of propylene formation by the catalyst under the described conditions is 6 mmol/s/kg. This value is similar to existing C3H6 production methods and suggests viability for commercialization of this catalyst.
In order to clarify the contribution of C3H8 and CO2 to the reaction, the effect of the partial pressure of compounds on the catalytic activity was investigated and the results are shown in
Fig. S4a and b
. The reaction orders for C3H8 and CO2 were determined by plotting the logarithm of the average TOF versus the logarithm of the inlet molar flow rate of the corresponding compound. From the resulting slope, the reaction orders were found to be 0.82  0.17 and 0.17  0.03 for propane and carbon dioxide, respectively. These results suggest that CH bond activation in C3H8 is the rate-determining step. Similar results for propane dehydrogenation with CO2 were observed previously
[31]
.
The apparent activation energies for the catalysts were calculated using Arrhenius plots. These data were obtained from experiments performed at a temperature interval of 500 C to 600 C. The Arrhenius plots yielded an apparent activation energy that is very similar for all the investigated samples, namely 136  12 kJ/mol for 0WV, 145  12 kJ/mol for 1.5WV, 141  15 kJ/mol for 4.5WV, and 127  11 kJ/mol for 6.8WV (
