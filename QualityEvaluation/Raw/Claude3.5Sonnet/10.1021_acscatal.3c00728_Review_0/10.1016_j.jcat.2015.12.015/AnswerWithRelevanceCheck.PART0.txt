          [1] "The demand for olefins, especially propylene, is expected to increase significantly in the near future."

          [2] "Steam cracking, Fluid Catalytic Cracking (FCC) and dehydrogenation (DH) are the primary methods to obtain olefins. Although these methods are commonly used to produce alkenes, they have some disadvantages: they are endothermic and suffer from the production of coke. In case of DH, alkane conversion is limited by thermodynamic constraints"

          [3] "An attractive alternative to this approach is the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODP) by molecular oxygen, which enables lower reaction temperatures and more effective inhibition of surface coke formation."

          [4] "Recently, CO2 has received much attention as a co-feed gas for dehydrogenation, because CO2 can act as a mild oxidant. Unlike oxygen, CO2 will not be able to fully oxidize the catalyst to its original state due to its weak oxidation capacity. It is a thermodynamically stable and a kinetically inert molecule, and it is also cheap and abundant"

          The significance of propene in the chemical industry has evolved with its increasing demand, which is expected to grow significantly in the near future. This rising demand is driving the adoption of propane dehydrogenation as a preferred production method. While traditional methods like steam cracking, Fluid Catalytic Cracking (FCC), and dehydrogenation (DH) are commonly used, they have disadvantages such as being endothermic, producing coke, and facing thermodynamic constraints.

          Propane dehydrogenation, particularly oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODP), offers several economic and environmental advantages in meeting the growing needs for this versatile olefin:

          1. It enables lower reaction temperatures compared to traditional methods.
          2. It more effectively inhibits surface coke formation during the reaction process.
          3. Using CO2 as a co-feed gas acts as a mild oxidant, providing benefits over using oxygen.
          4. CO2 is cheap, abundant, and thermodynamically stable, making it an attractive option economically and environmentally.
          5. The use of CO2 prevents full oxidation of the catalyst, potentially improving catalyst lifespan.
          6. It offers more focused production of propene, as opposed to steam cracking which produces a mix of olefins.
          7. It potentially has lower energy requirements compared to endothermic processes like steam cracking.

          These advantages make propane dehydrogenation an attractive alternative to traditional methods, potentially reducing energy consumption, improving process efficiency, and utilizing an abundant greenhouse gas as a feedstock. As the demand for propene continues to grow across various applications, propane dehydrogenation is likely to play an increasingly important role in meeting industry needs while addressing environmental concerns.

          丙烯在化学工业中的重要性随着其需求的增加而发展，预计在不久的将来会显著增长。这种不断增长的需求正在推动丙烷脱氢作为首选生产方法的采用。虽然蒸汽裂解、流化催化裂化（FCC）和脱氢（DH）等传统方法常被使用，但它们存在缺点，如吸热反应、产生焦炭和面临热力学限制。

          丙烷脱氢，特别是丙烷的氧化脱氢（ODP），在满足这种多用途烯烃不断增长的需求方面提供了几个经济和环境优势：

          1. 与传统方法相比，它能够在较低的反应温度下进行。
          2. 它更有效地抑制了反应过程中的表面焦炭形成。
          3. 使用CO2作为共进料气体起到温和氧化剂的作用，比使用氧气具有优势。
          4. CO2便宜、丰富且热力学稳定，使其在经济和环境方面成为一个有吸引力的选择。
          5. CO2的使用防止了催化剂的完全氧化，可能延长催化剂寿命。
          6. 它提供了更专注于丙烯的生产，而不像蒸汽裂解那样产生混合烯烃。
          7. 与蒸汽裂解等吸热过程相比，可能具有更低的能源需求。

          这些优势使丙烷脱氢成为传统方法的一个有吸引力的替代方案，可能减少能源消耗，提高过程效率，并利用丰富的温室气体作为原料。随着丙烯在各种应用中的需求持续增长，丙烷脱氢可能在满足行业需求的同时解决环境问题方面发挥越来越重要的作用。
