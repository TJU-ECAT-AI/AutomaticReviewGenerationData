[1] "The demand for olefins, especially propylene, is expected to increase significantly in the near future."

[2] "An attractive alternative to this approach is the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODP) by molecular oxygen, which enables lower reaction temperatures and more effective inhibition of surface coke formation."

[3] "Recently, CO2 has received much attention as a co-feed gas for dehydrogenation, because CO2 can act as a mild oxidant. Unlike oxygen, CO2 will not be able to fully oxidize the catalyst to its original state due to its weak oxidation capacity. It is a thermodynamically stable and a kinetically inert molecule, and it is also cheap and abundant"

The literature indicates that propene demand is projected to grow substantially in the coming years, driving interest in propane dehydrogenation as a production method. This approach offers several advantages:

1. It allows for lower reaction temperatures compared to traditional methods.

2. It more effectively inhibits surface coke formation during the reaction process.

3. Using CO2 as a co-feed gas acts as a mild oxidant, providing benefits over using oxygen.

4. CO2 is cheap, abundant, and thermodynamically stable, making it an attractive option economically and environmentally.

5. The use of CO2 prevents full oxidation of the catalyst, potentially improving catalyst lifespan.

While not explicitly stated, these factors suggest propane dehydrogenation could offer economic and environmental benefits in meeting growing propene demand across various applications by improving reaction efficiency, reducing energy requirements, and utilizing an abundant greenhouse gas as a feedstock.

文献表明,丙烯的需求预计在未来几年将大幅增长,推动了对丙烷脱氢作为生产方法的兴趣。这种方法提供了几个优势:

1. 与传统方法相比,它允许较低的反应温度。

2. 它更有效地抑制了反应过程中的表面积碳形成。

3. 使用CO2作为共进料气体起到温和氧化剂的作用,比使用氧气具有优势。

4. CO2便宜、丰富且热力学稳定,使其在经济和环境方面成为一个有吸引力的选择。

5. CO2的使用防止了催化剂的完全氧化,可能延长催化剂寿命。

虽然没有明确说明,但这些因素表明,丙烷脱氢可能通过提高反应效率、降低能源需求和利用丰富的温室气体作为原料,在满足各种应用中不断增长的丙烯需求方面提供经济和环境效益。
