[1] "The demand for olefins, especially propylene, is expected to increase significantly in the near future."

[2] "Steam cracking, Fluid Catalytic Cracking (FCC) and dehydrogenation (DH) are the primary methods to obtain olefins. Although these methods are commonly used to produce alkenes, they have some disadvantages: they are endothermic and suffer from the production of coke. In case of DH, alkane conversion is limited by thermodynamic constraints"

[3] "An attractive alternative to this approach is the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODP) by molecular oxygen, which enables lower reaction temperatures and more effective inhibition of surface coke formation."

The significance of propene in the chemical industry has grown, with demand expected to increase substantially in the coming years. This rising demand is driving the adoption of propane dehydrogenation as a preferred production method. While traditional methods like steam cracking, fluid catalytic cracking, and dehydrogenation are commonly used, they have drawbacks such as being endothermic and producing coke. Propane dehydrogenation offers advantages over these methods, particularly when done oxidatively. Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane allows for lower reaction temperatures and more effective prevention of surface coke formation. These benefits make propane dehydrogenation an attractive option for meeting the growing needs for propene across various applications, offering both economic and environmental advantages compared to traditional production methods.
