[1] "The demand for olefins, especially propylene, is expected to increase significantly in the near future."

[2] "Steam cracking, Fluid Catalytic Cracking (FCC) and dehydrogenation (DH) are the primary methods to obtain olefins. Although these methods are commonly used to produce alkenes, they have some disadvantages: they are endothermic and suffer from the production of coke. In case of DH, alkane conversion is limited by thermodynamic constraints"

The significance of propene in the chemical industry has evolved with its increasing demand, which is expected to grow significantly in the near future. This rising demand is driving the adoption of propane dehydrogenation as a preferred production method. While steam cracking, Fluid Catalytic Cracking (FCC), and dehydrogenation (DH) are the primary methods to obtain olefins, propane dehydrogenation offers certain advantages over these traditional methods.

The economic and environmental advantages of propane dehydrogenation in meeting the growing needs for propene include:

1. Potentially lower energy requirements compared to endothermic processes like steam cracking.
2. Reduced coke production, which is a common issue with other olefin production methods.
3. More focused production of propene, as opposed to steam cracking which produces a mix of olefins.

However, it's important to note that propane dehydrogenation still faces challenges, such as thermodynamic constraints on alkane conversion. The literature does not provide specific information on the various applications driving propene demand or detailed economic comparisons between production methods.

丙烯在化学工业中的重要性随着其需求的增加而发展，预计在不久的将来会显著增长。这种不断增长的需求正在推动丙烷脱氢作为首选生产方法的采用。虽然蒸汽裂解、流化催化裂化（FCC）和脱氢（DH）是获得烯烃的主要方法，但丙烷脱氢相比这些传统方法具有一定优势。

丙烷脱氢在满足丙烯不断增长需求方面的经济和环境优势包括：

1. 与蒸汽裂解等吸热过程相比，可能具有更低的能源需求。
2. 减少焦炭生成，这是其他烯烃生产方法常见的问题。
3. 更专注于丙烯的生产，而不像蒸汽裂解那样产生混合烯烃。

然而，需要注意的是，丙烷脱氢仍面临挑战，如烷烃转化的热力学限制。文献中没有提供关于推动丙烯需求的各种应用的具体信息，也没有详细的生产方法经济比较。
