[1] "With increasing oil prices, an alternative process for the production of lower alkenes is economically reasonable. Oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH), e.g., of propane, is an attractive reaction route instead of steam cracking of naphtha or catalytic cracking/dehydrogenation"

[2] "Due to the increasing world demand for propene, the ODH reaction is a great challenge for catalysis research and development, and growing attention has been focused on this topic in the past decade."

[3] "The effectiveness of the catalyst, that is the activity for alkane conversion and the selectivity to desired products, will ultimately determine the economic attractiveness of an alkane-based chemical process."

[4] "However, in the case of alkenes produced from alkanes, the lower cost of the feedstock is not a real incentive, since current commercial technologies for olefin production already use fuel-grade feedstocks. In this case, conversely, the improved energy efficiency (ODH is exothermal, while dehydrogenation and cracking are endothermal), and process simplicity are effective incentives"

The significance of propene in the chemical industry has grown due to increasing world demand, driving research into alternative production methods like propane dehydrogenation. This shift is motivated by several factors:

1. Economic considerations: With rising oil prices, finding alternative processes for lower alkene production has become economically reasonable. 

2. Energy efficiency: Oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of propane is exothermic, offering improved energy efficiency compared to endothermic processes like steam cracking or catalytic cracking/dehydrogenation.

3. Process simplicity: ODH provides a simpler process compared to traditional methods.

4. Catalyst development: The effectiveness of catalysts in terms of activity for alkane conversion and selectivity to desired products is crucial for the economic viability of alkane-based chemical processes.

While the lower cost of feedstock isn't a primary driver (as current technologies already use fuel-grade feedstocks), the improved energy efficiency and process simplicity of ODH make it an attractive option for meeting the growing propene demand across various applications. The development of effective catalysts for this process has become a significant focus of research in recent years, aiming to optimize the economic and environmental advantages of this approach.

由于全球需求的增加，丙烯在化学工业中的重要性日益增长，推动了对替代生产方法如丙烷脱氢的研究。这种转变是由几个因素驱动的：

1. 经济考虑：随着油价上涨，寻找生产低级烯烃的替代工艺在经济上变得合理。

2. 能源效率：丙烷的氧化脱氢（ODH）是放热反应，与蒸汽裂解或催化裂解/脱氢等吸热过程相比，能源效率更高。

3. 工艺简单：ODH提供了比传统方法更简单的工艺。

4. 催化剂开发：催化剂在烷烃转化活性和目标产物选择性方面的有效性，对烷烃基化学工艺的经济可行性至关重要。

虽然原料成本较低并不是主要驱动因素（因为当前技术已经使用燃料级原料），但ODH在能源效率和工艺简单性方面的改进使其成为满足各种应用中日益增长的丙烯需求的有吸引力的选择。近年来，为这一过程开发有效催化剂已成为研究的重点，旨在优化这种方法的经济和环境优势。
