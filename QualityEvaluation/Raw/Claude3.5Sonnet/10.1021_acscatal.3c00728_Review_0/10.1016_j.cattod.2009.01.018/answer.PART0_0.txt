[1] "With increasing oil prices, an alternative process for the production of lower alkenes is economically reasonable. Oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH), e.g., of propane, is an attractive reaction route instead of steam cracking of naphtha or catalytic cracking/dehydrogenation"

[2] "Due to the increasing world demand for propene, the ODH reaction is a great challenge for catalysis research and development, and growing attention has been focused on this topic in the past decade."

[3] "The effectiveness of the catalyst, that is the activity for alkane conversion and the selectivity to desired products, will ultimately determine the economic attractiveness of an alkane-based chemical process."

[4] "In this case, conversely, the improved energy efficiency (ODH is exothermal, while dehydrogenation and cracking are endothermal), and process simplicity are effective incentives"

The significance of propene in the chemical industry has grown due to increasing world demand, driving adoption of propane dehydrogenation as a preferred production method. This is evident from the growing research attention on oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of propane in the past decade.

Propane dehydrogenation, specifically ODH, offers several economic and environmental advantages:

1. Economic reasonability: With rising oil prices, ODH provides an economically viable alternative for producing lower alkenes like propene.

2. Energy efficiency: ODH is an exothermic process, unlike traditional endothermic dehydrogenation and cracking methods, leading to improved energy efficiency.

3. Process simplicity: ODH offers a simpler production process compared to steam cracking of naphtha or catalytic cracking/dehydrogenation.

4. Catalyst effectiveness: The economic attractiveness of alkane-based chemical processes, including propane dehydrogenation, largely depends on catalyst activity and selectivity.

These advantages position propane dehydrogenation as a preferred method to meet the growing needs for propene across various applications in the chemical industry.

丙烯在化工行业的重要性不断增长，这主要是由于全球需求的增加，推动了丙烷脱氢作为首选生产方法的采用。这一点从过去十年中对丙烷氧化脱氢（ODH）研究关注度的增加可以看出。

丙烷脱氢，特别是ODH，提供了几个经济和环境方面的优势：

1. 经济合理性：随着油价上涨，ODH为生产低级烯烃（如丙烯）提供了一种经济可行的替代方法。

2. 能源效率：与传统的吸热脱氢和裂解方法不同，ODH是一个放热过程，从而提高了能源效率。

3. 工艺简单：与石脑油蒸汽裂解或催化裂解/脱氢相比，ODH提供了一个更简单的生产过程。

4. 催化剂效率：基于烷烃的化学过程（包括丙烷脱氢）的经济吸引力在很大程度上取决于催化剂的活性和选择性。

这些优势使丙烷脱氢成为满足化工行业各种应用对丙烯日益增长需求的首选方法。
