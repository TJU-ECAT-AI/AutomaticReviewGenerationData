[1] "With increasing oil prices, an alternative process for the production of lower alkenes is economically reasonable. Oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH), e.g., of propane, is an attractive reaction route instead of steam cracking of naphtha or catalytic cracking/dehydrogenation"

[2] "Due to the increasing world demand for propene, the ODH reaction is a great challenge for catalysis research and development, and growing attention has been focused on this topic in the past decade."

[3] "The effectiveness of the catalyst, that is the activity for alkane conversion and the selectivity to desired products, will ultimately determine the economic attractiveness of an alkane-based chemical process."

[4] "However, in the case of alkenes produced from alkanes, the lower cost of the feedstock is not a real incentive, since current commercial technologies for olefin production already use fuel-grade feedstocks. In this case, conversely, the improved energy efficiency (ODH is exothermal, while dehydrogenation and cracking are endothermal), and process simplicity are effective incentives"

The significance of propene in the chemical industry has grown due to increasing world demand, driving research into alternative production methods like propane dehydrogenation. This growing demand has made oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of propane an attractive alternative to traditional methods like steam cracking of naphtha or catalytic cracking/dehydrogenation.

The economic advantages of propane dehydrogenation include:

1. Improved energy efficiency: ODH is exothermic, while traditional dehydrogenation and cracking processes are endothermic.
2. Process simplicity: ODH offers a simpler production process compared to existing methods.

Environmental advantages are not explicitly mentioned in the given text, but the improved energy efficiency of ODH likely results in reduced carbon emissions compared to more energy-intensive traditional methods.

The adoption of propane dehydrogenation is driven by the need for more efficient and economical production methods to meet the growing demand for propene across various applications. The effectiveness of catalysts in terms of alkane conversion activity and selectivity to desired products is crucial in determining the economic viability of this process.

由于全球需求的增长，丙烯在化学工业中的重要性不断提高，推动了对替代生产方法如丙烷脱氢的研究。这种日益增长的需求使得丙烷的氧化脱氢(ODH)成为传统方法(如石脑油蒸汽裂解或催化裂解/脱氢)的一个有吸引力的替代方案。

丙烷脱氢的经济优势包括：

1. 提高能源效率：ODH是放热反应，而传统的脱氢和裂解过程是吸热反应。
2. 工艺简单：与现有方法相比，ODH提供了一个更简单的生产过程。

虽然文中没有明确提到环境优势，但ODH的能源效率提高可能会导致与更耗能的传统方法相比，碳排放减少。

丙烷脱氢的采用是由于需要更高效和经济的生产方法来满足各种应用领域对丙烯日益增长的需求。催化剂在烷烃转化活性和目标产品选择性方面的效果对于确定这一过程的经济可行性至关重要。
