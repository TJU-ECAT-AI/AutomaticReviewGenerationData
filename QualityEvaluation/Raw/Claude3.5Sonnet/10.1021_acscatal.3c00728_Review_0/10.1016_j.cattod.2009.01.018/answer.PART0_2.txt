[1] "With increasing oil prices, an alternative process for the production of lower alkenes is economically reasonable. Oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH), e.g., of propane, is an attractive reaction route instead of steam cracking of naphtha or catalytic cracking/dehydrogenation"

[2] "Due to the increasing world demand for propene, the ODH reaction is a great challenge for catalysis research and development, and growing attention has been focused on this topic in the past decade."

[3] "The effectiveness of the catalyst, that is the activity for alkane conversion and the selectivity to desired products, will ultimately determine the economic attractiveness of an alkane-based chemical process."

[4] "However, in the case of alkenes produced from alkanes, the lower cost of the feedstock is not a real incentive, since current commercial technologies for olefin production already use fuel-grade feedstocks. In this case, conversely, the improved energy efficiency (ODH is exothermal, while dehydrogenation and cracking are endothermal), and process simplicity are effective incentives"

The significance of propene in the chemical industry has grown due to increasing world demand, driving research into alternative production methods like propane dehydrogenation. This trend is partly motivated by rising oil prices, which make alternative processes for lower alkene production more economically viable. 

Oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of propane has emerged as an attractive alternative to traditional methods like steam cracking of naphtha or catalytic cracking/dehydrogenation. The main advantages of propane ODH include:

1. Improved energy efficiency: ODH is exothermic, while traditional dehydrogenation and cracking processes are endothermic.

2. Process simplicity: ODH offers a simpler production process compared to conventional methods.

3. Economic potential: The effectiveness of catalysts in terms of alkane conversion activity and selectivity to desired products will ultimately determine the economic attractiveness of this alkane-based chemical process.

It's worth noting that the lower cost of the alkane feedstock itself is not a primary incentive, as current commercial technologies already use fuel-grade feedstocks. Instead, the focus is on developing more efficient and selective catalysts to make the ODH process economically competitive and environmentally advantageous in meeting the growing demand for propene across various applications.

由于世界对丙烯的需求不断增加，丙烯在化学工业中的重要性日益增长，这推动了对替代生产方法（如丙烷脱氢）的研究。这一趋势部分是由于油价上涨，使得低级烯烃生产的替代工艺在经济上更具可行性。

丙烷的氧化脱氢（ODH）已成为传统方法（如石脑油蒸汽裂解或催化裂解/脱氢）的一个有吸引力的替代方案。丙烷ODH的主要优势包括：

1. 能源效率提高：ODH是放热反应，而传统的脱氢和裂解过程是吸热反应。

2. 工艺简单：与传统方法相比，ODH提供了更简单的生产工艺。

3. 经济潜力：催化剂在烷烃转化活性和目标产物选择性方面的有效性，最终将决定这种基于烷烃的化学工艺的经济吸引力。

值得注意的是，烷烃原料本身的低成本并不是主要动力，因为当前的商业技术已经使用燃料级原料。相反，重点是开发更高效、更具选择性的催化剂，使ODH工艺在经济上具有竞争力，并在环境方面具有优势，以满足各种应用领域对丙烯日益增长的需求。
