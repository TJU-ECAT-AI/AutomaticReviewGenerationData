          [1] "With increasing oil prices, an alternative process for the production of lower alkenes is economically reasonable. Oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH), e.g., of propane, is an attractive reaction route instead of steam cracking of naphtha or catalytic cracking/dehydrogenation"

[2] "Due to the increasing world demand for propene, the ODH reaction is a great challenge for catalysis research and development, and growing attention has been focused on this topic in the past decade."

[3] "The effectiveness of the catalyst, that is the activity for alkane conversion and the selectivity to desired products, will ultimately determine the economic attractiveness of an alkane-based chemical process."

[4] "In this case, conversely, the improved energy efficiency (ODH is exothermal, while dehydrogenation and cracking are endothermal), and process simplicity are effective incentives"

          The significance of propene in the chemical industry has grown due to increasing global demand, driving the adoption of propane dehydrogenation, specifically oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH), as a preferred production method. This shift is motivated by several factors:

1. Economic considerations: With rising oil prices, alternative processes for lower alkene production have become economically viable.

2. Energy efficiency: ODH of propane is exothermic, offering improved energy efficiency compared to endothermic processes like steam cracking or catalytic cracking/dehydrogenation.

3. Process simplicity: ODH provides a simpler process compared to traditional methods.

4. Catalyst development: The effectiveness of catalysts in terms of activity for alkane conversion and selectivity to desired products is crucial for the economic viability of alkane-based chemical processes.

The economic advantages of propane ODH include:
- It is economically reasonable, especially with increasing oil prices.
- It offers an alternative to traditional methods like steam cracking of naphtha or catalytic cracking/dehydrogenation.
- The effectiveness of the catalyst in terms of activity and selectivity determines the economic attractiveness of the process.

Environmental advantages include:
- Improved energy efficiency, as ODH is exothermal while traditional dehydrogenation and cracking are endothermal.
- Process simplicity, which can lead to reduced environmental impact.

These advantages position propane dehydrogenation, particularly ODH, as an attractive option for meeting the growing needs for propene across various applications in the chemical industry. The development of effective catalysts for this process has become a significant focus of research in recent years, aiming to optimize the economic and environmental advantages of this approach.

          由于全球需求的增加，丙烯在化学工业中的重要性日益增长，推动了丙烷脱氢，特别是氧化脱氢（ODH）成为首选的生产方法。这种转变是由几个因素驱动的：

1. 经济考虑：随着油价上涨，生产低级烯烃的替代工艺在经济上变得可行。

2. 能源效率：丙烷的氧化脱氢（ODH）是放热反应，与蒸汽裂解或催化裂解/脱氢等吸热过程相比，能源效率更高。

3. 工艺简单：ODH提供了比传统方法更简单的工艺。

4. 催化剂开发：催化剂在烷烃转化活性和目标产物选择性方面的有效性，对烷烃基化学工艺的经济可行性至关重要。

丙烷ODH的经济优势包括：
- 随着油价上涨，它在经济上是合理的。
- 它为传统方法如石脑油蒸汽裂解或催化裂解/脱氢提供了替代方案。
- 催化剂在活性和选择性方面的有效性决定了这一烷烃基化学过程的经济吸引力。

环境优势包括：
- 能源效率提高，因为ODH是放热反应，而传统的脱氢和裂解是吸热反应。
- 工艺简单，可以减少对环境的影响。

这些优势使丙烷脱氢，特别是ODH，成为满足化工行业各种应用中日益增长的丙烯需求的有吸引力的选择。近年来，为这一过程开发有效催化剂已成为研究的重点，旨在优化这种方法的经济和环境优势。
