The significance of propene in the chemical industry has grown due to increasing world demand, driving adoption of propane dehydrogenation as a preferred production method. This is evident from the growing research attention on oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of propane in the past decade.

Propane dehydrogenation, specifically ODH, offers several economic and environmental advantages:

1. Economic reasonability: With rising oil prices, ODH provides an economically viable alternative for producing lower alkenes like propene.

2. Energy efficiency: ODH is an exothermic process, unlike traditional endothermic dehydrogenation and cracking methods, leading to improved energy efficiency.

3. Process simplicity: ODH offers a simpler production process compared to steam cracking of naphtha or catalytic cracking/dehydrogenation.

4. Catalyst effectiveness: The economic attractiveness of alkane-based chemical processes, including propane dehydrogenation, largely depends on catalyst activity and selectivity.

These advantages position propane dehydrogenation as a preferred method to meet the growing needs for propene across various applications in the chemical industry.

丙烯在化工行业的重要性不断增长，这主要是由于全球需求的增加，推动了丙烷脱氢作为首选生产方法的采用。这一点从过去十年中对丙烷氧化脱氢（ODH）研究关注度的增加可以看出。

丙烷脱氢，特别是ODH，提供了几个经济和环境方面的优势：

1. 经济合理性：随着油价上涨，ODH为生产低级烯烃（如丙烯）提供了一种经济可行的替代方法。

2. 能源效率：与传统的吸热脱氢和裂解方法不同，ODH是一个放热过程，从而提高了能源效率。

3. 工艺简单：与石脑油蒸汽裂解或催化裂解/脱氢相比，ODH提供了一个更简单的生产过程。

4. 催化剂效率：基于烷烃的化学过程（包括丙烷脱氢）的经济吸引力在很大程度上取决于催化剂的活性和选择性。

这些优势使丙烷脱氢成为满足化工行业各种应用对丙烯日益增长需求的首选方法。

The significance of propene in the chemical industry has grown due to increasing world demand, driving research into alternative production methods like propane dehydrogenation. This growing demand has made oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of propane an attractive alternative to traditional methods like steam cracking of naphtha or catalytic cracking/dehydrogenation.

The economic advantages of propane dehydrogenation include:

1. Improved energy efficiency: ODH is exothermic, while traditional dehydrogenation and cracking processes are endothermic.
2. Process simplicity: ODH offers a simpler production process compared to existing methods.

Environmental advantages are not explicitly mentioned in the given text, but the improved energy efficiency of ODH likely results in reduced carbon emissions compared to more energy-intensive traditional methods.

The adoption of propane dehydrogenation is driven by the need for more efficient and economical production methods to meet the growing demand for propene across various applications. The effectiveness of catalysts in terms of alkane conversion activity and selectivity to desired products is crucial in determining the economic viability of this process.

The significance of propene in the chemical industry has grown due to increasing world demand, driving research into alternative production methods like propane dehydrogenation. This trend is partly motivated by rising oil prices, which make alternative processes for lower alkene production more economically viable. 

Oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of propane has emerged as an attractive alternative to traditional methods like steam cracking of naphtha or catalytic cracking/dehydrogenation. The main advantages of propane ODH include:

1. Improved energy efficiency: ODH is exothermic, while traditional dehydrogenation and cracking processes are endothermic.

2. Process simplicity: ODH offers a simpler production process compared to conventional methods.

3. Economic potential: The effectiveness of catalysts in terms of alkane conversion activity and selectivity to desired products will ultimately determine the economic attractiveness of this alkane-based chemical process.

It's worth noting that the lower cost of the alkane feedstock itself is not a primary incentive, as current commercial technologies already use fuel-grade feedstocks. Instead, the focus is on developing more efficient and selective catalysts to make the ODH process economically competitive and environmentally advantageous in meeting the growing demand for propene across various applications.

The significance of propene in the chemical industry has grown due to increasing world demand, driving research into alternative production methods like propane dehydrogenation. This shift is motivated by several factors:

1. Economic considerations: With rising oil prices, finding alternative processes for lower alkene production has become economically reasonable. 

2. Energy efficiency: Oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of propane is exothermic, offering improved energy efficiency compared to endothermic processes like steam cracking or catalytic cracking/dehydrogenation.

3. Process simplicity: ODH provides a simpler process compared to traditional methods.

4. Catalyst development: The effectiveness of catalysts in terms of activity for alkane conversion and selectivity to desired products is crucial for the economic viability of alkane-based chemical processes.

While the lower cost of feedstock isn't a primary driver (as current technologies already use fuel-grade feedstocks), the improved energy efficiency and process simplicity of ODH make it an attractive option for meeting the growing propene demand across various applications. The development of effective catalysts for this process has become a significant focus of research in recent years, aiming to optimize the economic and environmental advantages of this approach.
