[1] "With increasing oil prices, an alternative process for the production of lower alkenes is economically reasonable. Oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH), e.g., of propane, is an attractive reaction route instead of steam cracking of naphtha or catalytic cracking/dehydrogenation"

[2] "Due to the increasing world demand for propene, the ODH reaction is a great challenge for catalysis research and development, and growing attention has been focused on this topic in the past decade."

[3] "The effectiveness of the catalyst, that is the activity for alkane conversion and the selectivity to desired products, will ultimately determine the economic attractiveness of an alkane-based chemical process."

[4] "In this case, conversely, the improved energy efficiency (ODH is exothermal, while dehydrogenation and cracking are endothermal), and process simplicity are effective incentives"

The significance of propene in the chemical industry has grown due to increasing world demand, as mentioned in the literature. This rising demand is driving the adoption of propane dehydrogenation, specifically oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH), as a preferred production method.

The economic advantages of propane ODH include:

1. It is economically reasonable, especially with increasing oil prices.
2. It offers an alternative to traditional methods like steam cracking of naphtha or catalytic cracking/dehydrogenation.
3. The effectiveness of the catalyst in terms of activity and selectivity determines the economic attractiveness of the process.

Environmental advantages include:

1. Improved energy efficiency, as ODH is exothermal while traditional dehydrogenation and cracking are endothermal.
2. Process simplicity, which can lead to reduced environmental impact.

These advantages make propane ODH an attractive option for meeting the growing needs for propene across various applications in the chemical industry. The literature suggests that this method is seen as a promising solution to address the increasing demand for this versatile olefin.

根据文献所述，丙烯在化工行业的重要性因全球需求增加而不断提高。这种不断增长的需求正推动丙烷脱氢，特别是氧化脱氢（ODH）成为首选的生产方法。

丙烷ODH的经济优势包括：

1. 随着油价上涨，它在经济上是合理的。
2. 它为传统方法如石脑油蒸汽裂解或催化裂解/脱氢提供了替代方案。
3. 催化剂在活性和选择性方面的有效性决定了这一烷烃基化学过程的经济吸引力。

环境优势包括：

1. 能源效率提高，因为ODH是放热反应，而传统的脱氢和裂解是吸热反应。
2. 工艺简单，可以减少对环境的影响。

这些优势使丙烷ODH成为满足化工行业各种应用中不断增长的丙烯需求的一个有吸引力的选择。文献表明，这种方法被视为解决这种多功能烯烃需求增加的一个有前景的解决方案。
