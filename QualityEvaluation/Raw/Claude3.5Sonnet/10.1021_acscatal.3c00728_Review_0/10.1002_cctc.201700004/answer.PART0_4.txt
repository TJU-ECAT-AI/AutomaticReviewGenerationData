Propylene has become one of the most important light olefins in the petrochemical industry. Its increasing demand has driven the adoption of propane dehydrogenation as a preferred production method. Traditional production methods like catalytic cracking of petroleum hydrocarbons and coal-based methanol-to-olefins processes are energy-intensive and emit significant amounts of CO2.

Direct catalytic dehydrogenation of propane to propylene has emerged as a more economical and environmentally friendly route. This method was commercialized in the 1990s by companies like UOP and ABB Lummus using platinum and chromium oxide-based catalysts.

The economic advantages of propane dehydrogenation include lower energy consumption and reduced CO2 emissions compared to traditional methods. Environmentally, it offers a cleaner production process with less carbon footprint.

Additionally, oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of propane has been developed as an attractive alternative. This method offers advantages such as freedom from coking issues and no equilibrium limitations on propane conversion, further improving the efficiency and sustainability of propylene production.

These advancements in propane dehydrogenation methods are crucial in meeting the growing demand for propylene across various applications in the petrochemical industry, while also addressing economic and environmental concerns.

丙烯已成为石油化工行业最重要的轻质烯烃之一。其不断增长的需求推动了丙烷脱氢作为首选生产方法的采用。传统的生产方法，如石油烃的催化裂解和煤基甲醇制烯烃工艺，都需要大量能源消耗，并排放大量二氧化碳。

丙烷直接催化脱氢制丙烯已成为一种更经济、更环保的路线。这种方法在20世纪90年代被UOP和ABB Lummus等公司商业化，使用铂和氧化铬基催化剂。

丙烷脱氢的经济优势包括与传统方法相比降低能源消耗和减少二氧化碳排放。从环境角度来看，它提供了一个碳足迹更小的清洁生产过程。

此外，丙烷的氧化脱氢（ODH）已被开发为一种有吸引力的替代方法。这种方法提供了诸如无积碳问题和丙烷转化无平衡限制等优势，进一步提高了丙烯生产的效率和可持续性。

这些丙烷脱氢方法的进步对于满足石油化工行业各种应用中不断增长的丙烯需求至关重要，同时也解决了经济和环境方面的问题。
