[1] "Propylene, which is one of the most important light olefins in the petrochemical industry, is currently produced mainly by catalytic cracking of petroleum-derived hydrocarbons or multistage coal-based methanol-to-olefins processes, both involving extensive energy consumption and significant emission of CO2."

[2] "Direct catalytic dehydrogenation of propane to propylene has been developed as a more economical and environmentally friendly route and has been commercialized by UOP and ABB Lummus in the 1990s, using Pt- and CrOx-based catalysts, respectively."

[3] "Oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of propane, catalyzed by transition-metal oxides and alkaline-earth metal oxychlorides, offers an attractive alternative route with the prominent characters of free coking and no equilibrium limitation in propane conversion, but the selectivity toward propylene is often lower than in the direct dehydrogenation route, primarily because of overoxidation of the formed propylene to CO2 (10–60%)."

Propylene has become one of the most crucial light olefins in the petrochemical industry. Its increasing importance has led to the development of propane dehydrogenation as a preferred production method. This shift is driven by several factors:

1. Economic advantages: Direct catalytic dehydrogenation of propane to propylene is more economical compared to traditional methods like catalytic cracking of petroleum-derived hydrocarbons or coal-based methanol-to-olefins processes.

2. Environmental benefits: Propane dehydrogenation is more environmentally friendly, as it involves less energy consumption and lower CO2 emissions compared to conventional production methods.

3. Commercialization: The viability of this approach has been demonstrated by its commercialization in the 1990s by companies like UOP and ABB Lummus, using Pt- and CrOx-based catalysts.

4. Process improvements: Oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of propane offers additional advantages, such as freedom from coking and no equilibrium limitations in propane conversion.

However, challenges remain, particularly in terms of selectivity. The ODH process often results in lower selectivity toward propylene compared to direct dehydrogenation, primarily due to overoxidation of propylene to CO2.

The adoption of propane dehydrogenation methods reflects the industry's efforts to meet the growing demand for propylene more efficiently and sustainably. This approach aligns with the need to develop more economical and environmentally conscious production processes for this versatile olefin, which finds applications across various sectors of the petrochemical industry.

丙烯已成为石油化工行业最重要的轻质烯烃之一。它日益增长的重要性导致了丙烷脱氢作为首选生产方法的发展。这种转变是由几个因素驱动的：

1. 经济优势：与传统的石油衍生烃催化裂解或煤基甲醇制烯烃等方法相比，丙烷直接催化脱氢制丙烯更加经济。

2. 环境效益：丙烷脱氢更加环保，因为与传统生产方法相比，它涉及的能源消耗更少，二氧化碳排放量更低。

3. 商业化：这种方法的可行性已在20世纪90年代由UOP和ABB Lummus等公司使用Pt和CrOx基催化剂进行商业化得到证实。

4. 工艺改进：丙烷氧化脱氢（ODH）提供了额外的优势，如无结焦和丙烷转化无平衡限制。

然而，仍然存在挑战，特别是在选择性方面。与直接脱氢相比，ODH过程通常导致丙烯选择性较低，主要是由于丙烯过度氧化为二氧化碳。

丙烷脱氢方法的采用反映了行业为更有效和可持续地满足丙烯日益增长的需求所做的努力。这种方法符合为这种多用途烯烃开发更经济和环保的生产工艺的需求，而这种烯烃在石油化工行业的各个领域都有应用。
