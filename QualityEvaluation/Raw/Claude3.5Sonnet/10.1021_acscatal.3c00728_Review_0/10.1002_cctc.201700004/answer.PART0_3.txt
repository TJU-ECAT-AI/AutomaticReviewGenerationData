Propylene has become one of the most important light olefins in the petrochemical industry. Its increasing demand has led to the development and adoption of propane dehydrogenation as a preferred production method. This shift is driven by several factors:

1. Economic advantages: Direct catalytic dehydrogenation of propane to propylene is more economical compared to traditional methods like catalytic cracking of petroleum-derived hydrocarbons or coal-based methanol-to-olefins processes.

2. Environmental benefits: Propane dehydrogenation is more environmentally friendly, as it involves less energy consumption and lower CO2 emissions compared to conventional production methods.

3. Technological advancements: The commercialization of propane dehydrogenation technologies by companies like UOP and ABB Lummus in the 1990s, using Pt- and CrOx-based catalysts, has made this method more accessible and efficient.

4. Process improvements: Oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of propane offers additional advantages, such as freedom from coking and no equilibrium limitation in propane conversion, making it an attractive alternative route.

These factors collectively contribute to meeting the growing needs for propylene across various applications in the petrochemical industry, while addressing both economic and environmental concerns.

丙烯已成为石油化工行业最重要的轻烯烃之一。其不断增长的需求导致了丙烷脱氢作为首选生产方法的发展和采用。这种转变是由几个因素推动的：

1. 经济优势：与传统方法（如石油衍生烃的催化裂解或煤基甲醇制烯烃工艺）相比，丙烷直接催化脱氢制丙烯更加经济。

2. 环境效益：与传统生产方法相比，丙烷脱氢更加环保，因为它消耗的能源更少，二氧化碳排放量更低。

3. 技术进步：20世纪90年代，UOP和ABB Lummus等公司使用铂和铬氧化物基催化剂将丙烷脱氢技术商业化，使这种方法更加accessible和高效。

4. 工艺改进：丙烷的氧化脱氢（ODH）提供了额外的优势，如无积碳和丙烷转化无平衡限制，使其成为一种有吸引力的替代路线。

这些因素共同为满足石油化工行业各种应用中日益增长的丙烯需求做出贡献，同时解决了经济和环境问题。
