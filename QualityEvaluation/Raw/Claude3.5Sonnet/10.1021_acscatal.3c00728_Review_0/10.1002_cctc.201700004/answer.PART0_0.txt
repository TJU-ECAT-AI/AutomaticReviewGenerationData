[1] "Propylene, which is one of the most important light olefins in the petrochemical industry, is currently produced mainly by catalytic cracking of petroleum-derived hydrocarbons or multistage coal-based methanol-to-olefins processes, both involving extensive energy consumption and significant emission of CO2."

[3] "Oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of propane, catalyzed by transition-metal oxides and alkaline-earth metal oxychlorides, offers an attractive alternative route with the prominent characters of free coking and no equilibrium limitation in propane conversion, but the selectivity toward propylene is often lower than in the direct dehydrogenation route, primarily because of overoxidation of the formed propylene to CO2 (10–60%)."

Propylene has become one of the most important light olefins in the petrochemical industry. The increasing demand for propylene has driven the adoption of propane dehydrogenation as a preferred production method. This shift is motivated by several factors:

1. Economic advantages: Direct catalytic dehydrogenation of propane to propylene is more economical compared to traditional methods like catalytic cracking of petroleum-derived hydrocarbons or coal-based methanol-to-olefins processes.

2. Environmental benefits: Propane dehydrogenation is considered more environmentally friendly than conventional production methods. It involves less energy consumption and lower CO2 emissions.

3. Commercialization: The process has been successfully commercialized since the 1990s by companies like UOP and ABB Lummus, using Pt- and CrOx-based catalysts respectively.

4. Process improvements: Oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of propane offers additional advantages such as freedom from coking and no equilibrium limitations on propane conversion.

However, there are still challenges to overcome, particularly in terms of selectivity. The ODH process often results in lower selectivity toward propylene compared to direct dehydrogenation, mainly due to overoxidation of propylene to CO2. 

As the demand for propylene continues to grow across various applications, further research and development in propane dehydrogenation technologies are likely to focus on improving selectivity, efficiency, and environmental performance to meet the increasing needs of this versatile olefin.

丙烯已成为石油化工行业最重要的轻烯烃之一。对丙烯日益增长的需求推动了丙烷脱氢作为首选生产方法的采用。这种转变是由几个因素驱动的：

1. 经济优势：与传统方法（如石油衍生碳氢化合物的催化裂解或煤基甲醇制烯烃工艺）相比，丙烷直接催化脱氢制丙烯更加经济。

2. 环境效益：与传统生产方法相比，丙烷脱氢被认为更加环保。它涉及的能耗更少，CO2排放量更低。

3. 商业化：自20世纪90年代以来，这一工艺已被UOP和ABB Lummus等公司成功商业化，分别使用Pt和CrOx基催化剂。

4. 工艺改进：丙烷的氧化脱氢（ODH）提供了额外的优势，如无结焦和丙烷转化无平衡限制。

然而，仍然存在需要克服的挑战，特别是在选择性方面。与直接脱氢相比，ODH工艺通常导致对丙烯的选择性较低，主要是由于丙烯过度氧化成CO2。

随着各种应用领域对丙烯需求的持续增长，丙烷脱氢技术的进一步研究和开发可能会集中在提高选择性、效率和环境性能上，以满足这种多用途烯烃日益增长的需求。
