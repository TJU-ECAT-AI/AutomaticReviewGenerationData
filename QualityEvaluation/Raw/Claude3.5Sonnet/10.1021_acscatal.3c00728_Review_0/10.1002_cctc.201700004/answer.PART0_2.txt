[1] "Propylene, which is one of the most important light olefins in the petrochemical industry, is currently produced mainly by catalytic cracking of petroleum-derived hydrocarbons or multistage coal-based methanol-to-olefins processes, both involving extensive energy consumption and significant emission of CO2."

[2] "Direct catalytic dehydrogenation of propane to propylene has been developed as a more economical and environmentally friendly route and has been commercialized by UOP and ABB Lummus in the 1990s, using Pt- and CrOx-based catalysts, respectively."

[3] "Oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of propane, catalyzed by transition-metal oxides and alkaline-earth metal oxychlorides, offers an attractive alternative route with the prominent characters of free coking and no equilibrium limitation in propane conversion, but the selectivity toward propylene is often lower than in the direct dehydrogenation route, primarily because of overoxidation of the formed propylene to CO2 (10–60%)."

Propylene has become one of the most important light olefins in the petrochemical industry. Its increasing demand has driven the adoption of propane dehydrogenation as a preferred production method for several reasons:

1. Economic advantages: Direct catalytic dehydrogenation of propane to propylene is more economical compared to traditional methods like catalytic cracking of petroleum-derived hydrocarbons or coal-based methanol-to-olefins processes.

2. Environmental benefits: Propane dehydrogenation is more environmentally friendly, as it involves less energy consumption and lower CO2 emissions compared to conventional production methods.

3. Commercialization: The process has been successfully commercialized since the 1990s, demonstrating its viability on an industrial scale.

4. Alternative routes: Oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of propane offers additional advantages, such as freedom from coking and no equilibrium limitations on propane conversion.

However, challenges remain, particularly in improving selectivity towards propylene and reducing overoxidation to CO2 in the ODH process. The development of more efficient catalysts and processes continues to drive research in this field to meet the growing demand for propylene across various applications in the chemical industry.

丙烯已成为石油化工行业最重要的轻质烯烃之一。其需求的不断增长推动了丙烷脱氢作为首选生产方法的采用，原因如下：

1. 经济优势：与传统的石油衍生烃催化裂解或基于煤的多级甲醇制烯烃工艺相比，丙烷直接催化脱氢制丙烯更加经济。

2. 环境效益：与传统生产方法相比，丙烷脱氢更加环保，因为它涉及的能源消耗更少，CO2排放量更低。

3. 商业化：该工艺自20世纪90年代以来已成功实现商业化，证明了其在工业规模上的可行性。

4. 替代路线：丙烷的氧化脱氢（ODH）提供了额外的优势，如无结焦问题和丙烷转化无平衡限制。

然而，仍然存在挑战，特别是在提高ODH过程中丙烯的选择性和减少过度氧化生成CO2方面。更高效催化剂和工艺的开发继续推动着这一领域的研究，以满足化工行业各种应用对丙烯日益增长的需求。
