[1] "Light olefins, such as ethylene, propylene and butene, are bulk commodities and platform building blocks for the production of value-adding polymers, oxygenates and important chemical intermediates."

[2] "The demand for these useful olefins has increased rapidly."

[3] "Catalytic non-oxidative dehydrogenation of light alkanes including ethane, propane and butane offers an alternative, practical and environmentally friendly approach for the production of light olefins, because cheap light alkanes separated from abundant shale gas or natural gas can be readily used as the feedstock in this process, and high olefin selectivity can be obtained."

Propene has become increasingly significant in the chemical industry as a key building block for producing valuable polymers, oxygenates, and chemical intermediates. The rapidly growing demand for propene and other light olefins has driven the adoption of propane dehydrogenation as a preferred production method.

Propane dehydrogenation offers several economic and environmental advantages in meeting the growing needs for propene:

1. It utilizes cheap and abundant light alkanes from shale gas or natural gas as feedstock, making it economically attractive.

2. It is a more environmentally friendly approach compared to traditional production methods.

3. The process can achieve high selectivity to propene, improving efficiency.

4. It provides an alternative route to meet increasing propene demand that cannot be satisfied by existing production methods alone.

5. As a non-oxidative process, it avoids issues associated with deep oxidation to CO2 that oxidative dehydrogenation faces.

Overall, propane dehydrogenation has emerged as a practical and sustainable solution to produce propene at scale, aligning with both economic interests and environmental considerations as demand continues to grow across various applications in the chemical industry.
