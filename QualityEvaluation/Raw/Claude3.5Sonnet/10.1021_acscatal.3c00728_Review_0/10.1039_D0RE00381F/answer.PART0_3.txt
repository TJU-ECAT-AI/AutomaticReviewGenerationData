[1] "Light olefins, such as ethylene, propylene and butene, are bulk commodities and platform building blocks for the production of value-adding polymers, oxygenates and important chemical intermediates."

[2] "The demand for these useful olefins has increased rapidly."

[3] "Catalytic non-oxidative dehydrogenation of light alkanes including ethane, propane and butane offers an alternative, practical and environmentally friendly approach for the production of light olefins,"

[4] "because cheap light alkanes separated from abundant shale gas or natural gas can be readily used as the feedstock in this process, and high olefin selectivity can be obtained."

Propene's significance in the chemical industry has grown as it has become an important platform chemical for producing various value-added products like polymers, oxygenates, and other chemical intermediates. The rapidly increasing demand for propene is driving the adoption of propane dehydrogenation as a preferred production method.

Propane dehydrogenation offers several economic and environmental advantages in meeting the growing needs for propene:

1. It uses cheap and abundant light alkanes from shale gas or natural gas as feedstock, making it economically attractive.

2. It is a more environmentally friendly approach compared to traditional olefin production methods.

3. The process can achieve high selectivity to propene, improving efficiency.

4. It provides an alternative production route to help meet rapidly growing demand that existing methods cannot satisfy.

5. As a non-oxidative process, it avoids issues with deep oxidation and loss of yield associated with oxidative dehydrogenation.

Overall, propane dehydrogenation allows for more sustainable and cost-effective production of propene to meet increasing industrial demand across various applications.
