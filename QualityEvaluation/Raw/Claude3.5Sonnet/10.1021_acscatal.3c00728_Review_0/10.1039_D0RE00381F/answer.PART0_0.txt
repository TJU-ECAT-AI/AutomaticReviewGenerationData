[1] "Light olefins, such as ethylene, propylene and butene, are bulk commodities and platform building blocks for the production of value-adding polymers, oxygenates and important chemical intermediates."

[2] "The demand for these useful olefins has increased rapidly."

[3] "Catalytic non-oxidative dehydrogenation of light alkanes including ethane, propane and butane offers an alternative, practical and environmentally friendly approach for the production of light olefins,"

[4] "because cheap light alkanes separated from abundant shale gas or natural gas can be readily used as the feedstock in this process, and high olefin selectivity can be obtained."

Propene's significance in the chemical industry has grown as it has become an essential building block for producing valuable polymers, oxygenates, and chemical intermediates. The rapidly increasing demand for propene and other light olefins has driven the adoption of propane dehydrogenation as a preferred production method.

Propane dehydrogenation offers several economic and environmental advantages in meeting the growing needs for propene:

1. It utilizes cheap and abundant feedstocks like shale gas or natural gas, making it cost-effective.

2. The process achieves high selectivity to propene, improving yield and efficiency.

3. It provides an alternative to traditional olefin production methods that rely on crude oil derivatives.

4. As a non-oxidative process, it is more environmentally friendly than some other production routes.

5. It allows for on-purpose propene production to meet specific market demands.

These factors make propane dehydrogenation an attractive option for producing propene to meet its increasing demand across various applications in the chemical industry.
