[1] "Light olefins, such as ethylene, propylene and butene, are bulk commodities and platform building blocks for the production of value-adding polymers, oxygenates and important chemical intermediates."

[2] "The demand for these useful olefins has increased rapidly."

[3] "Catalytic non-oxidative dehydrogenation of light alkanes including ethane, propane and butane offers an alternative, practical and environmentally friendly approach for the production of light olefins,"

[4] "because cheap light alkanes separated from abundant shale gas or natural gas can be readily used as the feedstock in this process, and high olefin selectivity can be obtained."

Propene's significance in the chemical industry has grown as it has become an essential building block for producing various valuable products like polymers, oxygenates, and chemical intermediates. The rapidly increasing demand for propene and other light olefins has driven the adoption of propane dehydrogenation as a preferred production method.

Propane dehydrogenation offers several economic and environmental advantages in meeting the growing needs for propene:

1. It uses cheap and abundant feedstock: Light alkanes like propane can be readily obtained from shale gas or natural gas.

2. High selectivity: The process can achieve high selectivity towards propene.

3. Environmental friendliness: As a non-oxidative process, it likely produces fewer emissions compared to traditional production methods.

4. Practicality: It provides an alternative, practical approach to producing light olefins like propene.

These advantages make propane dehydrogenation an attractive method for meeting the increasing demand for propene across its various applications in the chemical industry.
