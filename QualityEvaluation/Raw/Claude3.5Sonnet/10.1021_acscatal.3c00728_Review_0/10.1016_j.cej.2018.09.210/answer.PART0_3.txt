[1] "Shale gas revolution in North America has recently promoted the mass production of natural gas liquids, specifically ethane and propane, making on-purpose olefin production from alkane dehydrogenation an attractive alternative to the traditional olefin production processes, such as steam crackers and fluid catalytic cracking of naphtha, light diesel, and other oil byproducts"

[2] "Because of the economical feedstock, relatively higher selectivity towards propylene, and lower energy demand, propane dehydrogenation (PDH) has become one of the most competitive propylene production processes and has already been successfully commercialized by Honeywell UOP (Oleflex), CB&I Lummus (Catofin), and Uhde (STAR)."

The significance of propene in the chemical industry has evolved due to the shale gas revolution in North America, which has led to increased production of natural gas liquids like propane. This abundance of economical feedstock has driven the adoption of propane dehydrogenation (PDH) as a preferred production method for propene.

PDH offers several economic and environmental advantages in meeting the growing demand for propene:

1. Economical feedstock: The availability of low-cost propane from shale gas makes PDH more cost-effective.

2. Higher selectivity: PDH provides relatively higher selectivity towards propylene compared to traditional methods.

3. Lower energy demand: The process requires less energy than conventional olefin production methods.

4. Competitiveness: These factors have made PDH one of the most competitive propylene production processes.

5. Commercial success: PDH has been successfully commercialized by major companies, indicating its viability and efficiency in meeting market demands.

The adoption of PDH helps meet the increasing needs for propene across various applications while offering economic benefits and potentially reducing environmental impact due to its lower energy requirements compared to traditional methods.

由于北美页岩气革命，丙烯在化工行业的重要性发生了变化，这导致了天然气液体如丙烷产量的增加。这种经济实惠的原料的丰富推动了丙烷脱氢(PDH)作为生产丙烯的首选方法的采用。

PDH在满足日益增长的丙烯需求方面提供了几个经济和环境优势：

1. 经济实惠的原料：来自页岩气的低成本丙烷使PDH更具成本效益。

2. 更高的选择性：与传统方法相比，PDH提供了较高的丙烯选择性。

3. 较低的能源需求：该过程比传统的烯烃生产方法需要更少的能源。

4. 竞争力：这些因素使PDH成为最具竞争力的丙烯生产工艺之一。

5. 商业成功：PDH已被主要公司成功商业化，表明其在满足市场需求方面的可行性和效率。

PDH的采用有助于满足各种应用对丙烯日益增长的需求，同时提供经济效益，并且由于其与传统方法相比能源需求较低，可能减少环境影响。
