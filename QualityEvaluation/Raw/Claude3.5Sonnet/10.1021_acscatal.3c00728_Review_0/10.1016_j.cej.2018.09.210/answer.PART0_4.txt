[1] "Shale gas revolution in North America has recently promoted the mass production of natural gas liquids, specifically ethane and propane, making on-purpose olefin production from alkane dehydrogenation an attractive alternative to the traditional olefin production processes, such as steam crackers and fluid catalytic cracking of naphtha, light diesel, and other oil byproducts"

[2] "Because of the economical feedstock, relatively higher selectivity towards propylene, and lower energy demand, propane dehydrogenation (PDH) has become one of the most competitive propylene production processes and has already been successfully commercialized by Honeywell UOP (Oleflex), CB&I Lummus (Catofin), and Uhde (STAR)."

The significance of propene in the chemical industry has evolved due to the shale gas revolution in North America, which has led to increased production of natural gas liquids like propane. This abundance of propane has made propane dehydrogenation (PDH) an attractive method for producing propene.

PDH is becoming a preferred production method for several reasons:

1. Economical feedstock: The availability of cheap propane from shale gas makes PDH more cost-effective.

2. Higher selectivity: PDH offers relatively higher selectivity towards propylene compared to traditional methods.

3. Lower energy demand: The process requires less energy than conventional olefin production methods.

These advantages have made PDH one of the most competitive propylene production processes, leading to its commercialization by major companies like Honeywell UOP, CB&I Lummus, and Uhde.

The economic advantages of PDH include lower production costs due to cheap feedstock and reduced energy consumption. Environmentally, the lower energy demand of PDH potentially translates to reduced carbon emissions compared to traditional olefin production methods.

As the demand for propene grows across various applications in the chemical industry, PDH offers a more efficient and potentially more sustainable way to meet these needs, driving its adoption as a preferred production method.

由于北美页岩气革命，丙烯在化工行业的重要性已经发生了变化，这导致了天然气液体如丙烷产量的增加。丙烷的丰富使得丙烷脱氢(PDH)成为生产丙烯的一种有吸引力的方法。

PDH正成为首选的生产方法，原因有几个：

1. 经济实惠的原料：页岩气提供的廉价丙烷使PDH更具成本效益。

2. 更高的选择性：与传统方法相比，PDH对丙烯的选择性相对较高。

3. 较低的能源需求：该过程比传统的烯烃生产方法需要更少的能源。

这些优势使PDH成为最具竞争力的丙烯生产工艺之一，导致霍尼韦尔UOP、CB&I Lummus和Uhde等大公司将其商业化。

PDH的经济优势包括由于廉价原料和减少能源消耗而降低的生产成本。从环境角度来看，PDH较低的能源需求可能意味着与传统烯烃生产方法相比，碳排放量减少。

随着化工行业各种应用对丙烯需求的增长，PDH提供了一种更有效且可能更可持续的方式来满足这些需求，推动其成为首选的生产方法。
