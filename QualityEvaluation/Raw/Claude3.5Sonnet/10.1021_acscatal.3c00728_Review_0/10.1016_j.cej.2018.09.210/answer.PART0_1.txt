[1] "Shale gas revolution in North America has recently promoted the mass production of natural gas liquids, specifically ethane and propane, making on-purpose olefin production from alkane dehydrogenation an attractive alternative to the traditional olefin production processes, such as steam crackers and fluid catalytic cracking of naphtha, light diesel, and other oil byproducts"

[2] "Because of the economical feedstock, relatively higher selectivity towards propylene, and lower energy demand, propane dehydrogenation (PDH) has become one of the most competitive propylene production processes and has already been successfully commercialized by Honeywell UOP (Oleflex), CB&I Lummus (Catofin), and Uhde (STAR)."

Propene's significance in the chemical industry has evolved due to the shale gas revolution in North America, which has led to increased production of natural gas liquids like propane. This abundance of economical feedstock has driven the adoption of propane dehydrogenation (PDH) as a preferred production method for propene.

The economic advantages of PDH include the use of cheaper propane feedstock and lower energy demand compared to traditional olefin production processes. Environmentally, PDH offers relatively higher selectivity towards propylene, potentially reducing unwanted byproducts.

PDH has become one of the most competitive propylene production processes, meeting the growing needs for this versatile olefin across various applications. Its commercial success is evidenced by its adoption by major companies like Honeywell UOP, CB&I Lummus, and Uhde.

由于北美页岩气革命，丙烯在化工行业的重要性发生了演变，这导致了天然气液体如丙烷产量的增加。这种经济实惠的原料供应充足，推动了丙烷脱氢(PDH)作为生产丙烯的首选方法的采用。

PDH的经济优势包括使用更便宜的丙烷原料，以及与传统烯烃生产工艺相比能源需求更低。从环境角度来看，PDH提供了相对更高的丙烯选择性，potentially减少了不需要的副产品。

PDH已成为最具竞争力的丙烯生产工艺之一，满足了这种多用途烯烃在各种应用中日益增长的需求。其商业成功由霍尼韦尔UOP、CB&I Lummus和Uhde等大公司的采用得到证实。
