[1] "Shale gas revolution in North America has recently promoted the mass production of natural gas liquids, specifically ethane and propane, making on-purpose olefin production from alkane dehydrogenation an attractive alternative to the traditional olefin production processes, such as steam crackers and fluid catalytic cracking of naphtha, light diesel, and other oil byproducts"

[2] "Because of the economical feedstock, relatively higher selectivity towards propylene, and lower energy demand, propane dehydrogenation (PDH) has become one of the most competitive propylene production processes and has already been successfully commercialized by Honeywell UOP (Oleflex), CB&I Lummus (Catofin), and Uhde (STAR)."

Propene's significance in the chemical industry has evolved significantly due to the shale gas revolution in North America. This revolution has led to increased production of natural gas liquids, including propane, which has made propane dehydrogenation (PDH) an attractive method for producing propene.

The growing demand for propene is driving the adoption of PDH as a preferred production method for several reasons:

1. Economical feedstock: The abundance of propane from shale gas makes it a cost-effective raw material.

2. Higher selectivity: PDH offers relatively higher selectivity towards propylene compared to traditional methods.

3. Lower energy demand: The process requires less energy than conventional olefin production processes.

These factors have made PDH one of the most competitive propylene production processes, leading to its successful commercialization by major companies.

The economic advantages of PDH include lower production costs due to cheaper feedstock and reduced energy consumption. Environmentally, the lower energy demand of PDH potentially translates to reduced carbon emissions compared to traditional olefin production methods.

By offering a more efficient and potentially cleaner production route, PDH is well-positioned to meet the growing needs for propene across various applications in the chemical industry, such as the production of polypropylene, acrylonitrile, and other derivatives used in manufacturing plastics, fibers, and numerous consumer products.

丙烯在化学工业中的重要性已经发生了显著的演变，这主要是由于北美页岩气革命。这场革命导致天然气液体（包括丙烷）的产量增加，使得丙烷脱氢（PDH）成为生产丙烯的一种有吸引力的方法。

丙烯需求的增长推动了PDH作为首选生产方法的采用，原因如下：

1. 经济的原料：页岩气提供的丙烷丰富，使其成为一种具有成本效益的原材料。

2. 更高的选择性：与传统方法相比，PDH对丙烯的选择性相对较高。

3. 较低的能源需求：该过程比传统的烯烃生产工艺需要更少的能源。

这些因素使PDH成为最具竞争力的丙烯生产工艺之一，导致其被主要公司成功商业化。

PDH的经济优势包括由于更便宜的原料和降低的能源消耗而降低生产成本。从环境角度来看，PDH较低的能源需求可能意味着与传统烯烃生产方法相比，碳排放量有所减少。

通过提供更高效和潜在更清洁的生产路线，PDH能够很好地满足化学工业中各种应用对丙烯日益增长的需求，例如生产聚丙烯、丙烯腈和其他用于制造塑料、纤维和众多消费品的衍生物。
