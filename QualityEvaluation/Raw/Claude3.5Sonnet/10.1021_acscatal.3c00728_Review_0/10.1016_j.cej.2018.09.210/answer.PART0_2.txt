[1] "Shale gas revolution in North America has recently promoted the mass production of natural gas liquids, specifically ethane and propane, making on-purpose olefin production from alkane dehydrogenation an attractive alternative to the traditional olefin production processes, such as steam crackers and fluid catalytic cracking of naphtha, light diesel, and other oil byproducts"

[2] "Because of the economical feedstock, relatively higher selectivity towards propylene, and lower energy demand, propane dehydrogenation (PDH) has become one of the most competitive propylene production processes and has already been successfully commercialized by Honeywell UOP (Oleflex), CB&I Lummus (Catofin), and Uhde (STAR)."

The significance of propene in the chemical industry has evolved due to the shale gas revolution in North America, which has led to increased production of natural gas liquids like propane. This abundance of economical feedstock has made propane dehydrogenation (PDH) an attractive alternative to traditional olefin production methods.

The growing demand for propene is driving the adoption of PDH as a preferred production method because it offers several advantages:

1. Economical feedstock: The availability of low-cost propane from shale gas makes PDH more cost-effective.

2. Higher selectivity: PDH provides relatively higher selectivity towards propylene compared to traditional methods.

3. Lower energy demand: The process requires less energy than conventional olefin production techniques.

These economic and environmental advantages have made PDH one of the most competitive propylene production processes. As a result, it has been successfully commercialized by major companies like Honeywell UOP, CB&I Lummus, and Uhde, indicating its growing importance in meeting the increasing demand for propene across various applications in the chemical industry.

由于北美页岩气革命，丙烯在化工行业的重要性发生了变化，这导致了天然气液体（如丙烷）产量的增加。这种经济实惠的原料丰富，使得丙烷脱氢（PDH）成为传统烯烃生产方法的有吸引力的替代方案。

丙烯需求的增长推动了PDH作为首选生产方法的采用，因为它具有以下几个优势：

1. 经济实惠的原料：来自页岩气的低成本丙烷使PDH更具成本效益。

2. 更高的选择性：与传统方法相比，PDH提供了相对更高的丙烯选择性。

3. 更低的能源需求：该过程比传统烯烃生产技术需要更少的能源。

这些经济和环境优势使PDH成为最具竞争力的丙烯生产工艺之一。因此，它已被霍尼韦尔UOP、CB&I Lummus和Uhde等大公司成功商业化，表明它在满足化工行业各种应用对丙烯日益增长的需求方面的重要性不断提高。
