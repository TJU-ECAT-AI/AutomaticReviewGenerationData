[1] "As ethane cracking only produces sparing amounts of olefins heavier than ethylene [1], a gap between the supply of propylene from crackers and the demand for propylene has emerged [2]."

[2] "To fill this gap, so-called on-purpose propylene production processes have been implemented such as propane dehydrogenation (PDH) which benefits from high propylene selectivity from catalysts that are typically platinum- or chromium-based [3]."

[3] "However, these processes also have significant disadvantages. PDH is highly endothermic and equilibrium-limited owing to the coproduction of H2, thus high reaction temperatures are required to drive conversion. Additionally, PDH catalysts deactivate rapidly due to the deposition of carbon (coke) on the surface and capital-intensive reactor designs allowing for semi-continuous catalyst regeneration have been engineered to work around this caveat."

Propene's significance in the chemical industry has evolved due to a growing gap between its supply from traditional cracking processes and increasing demand. This gap has emerged because ethane cracking, which has become more prevalent due to the abundance of natural gas, produces very little propylene compared to naphtha cracking.

To address this supply-demand imbalance, on-purpose propylene production methods like propane dehydrogenation (PDH) have been adopted. PDH is preferred because it offers high propylene selectivity using platinum- or chromium-based catalysts.

However, PDH has some economic and environmental drawbacks. It is highly endothermic, requiring high reaction temperatures, which increases energy costs. The process is also equilibrium-limited due to hydrogen co-production. Additionally, PDH catalysts deactivate quickly from carbon deposition, necessitating expensive reactor designs for frequent catalyst regeneration.

The literature does not provide specific information on the economic and environmental advantages of PDH in meeting growing propylene needs across various applications. However, it can be inferred that despite its drawbacks, PDH is still considered a viable solution to bridge the propylene supply gap, likely due to its high selectivity and the abundance of propane feedstock from natural gas.

丙烯在化工行业的重要性已经发生了变化，这是由于传统裂解工艺的供应与日益增长的需求之间出现了差距。这种差距的出现是因为乙烷裂解（由于天然气的丰富而变得更加普遍）与石脑油裂解相比，产生的丙烯量很少。

为了解决这种供需不平衡，已经采用了诸如丙烷脱氢（PDH）等定向丙烯生产方法。PDH之所以受到青睐，是因为它使用铂基或铬基催化剂可以提供高丙烯选择性。

然而，PDH也存在一些经济和环境方面的缺点。它是高度吸热的，需要高反应温度，这增加了能源成本。由于副产氢气，该过程也受到平衡限制。此外，PDH催化剂由于碳沉积而迅速失活，需要昂贵的反应器设计以进行频繁的催化剂再生。

文献中没有提供PDH在满足各种应用中日益增长的丙烯需求方面的具体经济和环境优势信息。然而，可以推断，尽管存在缺点，PDH仍被认为是弥补丙烯供应缺口的可行解决方案，这可能是由于其高选择性和天然气中丙烷原料的丰富性。
