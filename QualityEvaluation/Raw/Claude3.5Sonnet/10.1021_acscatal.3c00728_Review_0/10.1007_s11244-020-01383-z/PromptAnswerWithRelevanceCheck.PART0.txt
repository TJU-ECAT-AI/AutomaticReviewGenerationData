[1] "As ethane cracking only produces sparing amounts of olefins heavier than ethylene [1], a gap between the supply of propylene from crackers and the demand for propylene has emerged [2]."

[2] "To fill this gap, so-called on-purpose propylene production processes have been implemented such as propane dehydrogenation (PDH) which benefits from high propylene selectivity from catalysts that are typically platinum- or chromium-based [3]."

[3] "However, these processes also have significant disadvantages. PDH is highly endothermic and equilibrium-limited owing to the coproduction of H2, thus high reaction temperatures are required to drive conversion. Additionally, PDH catalysts deactivate rapidly due to the deposition of carbon (coke) on the surface and capital-intensive reactor designs allowing for semi-continuous catalyst regeneration have been engineered to work around this caveat."

Propene's significance in the chemical industry has evolved due to a growing gap between supply and demand. As ethane cracking, a traditional production method, produces limited amounts of heavier olefins like propylene, there has been an increasing demand that outpaces supply from crackers.

To address this gap, propane dehydrogenation (PDH) has been adopted as a preferred production method. PDH offers high propylene selectivity using platinum- or chromium-based catalysts. This approach helps meet the growing needs for propylene across various applications in the chemical industry.

However, PDH has some economic and environmental drawbacks. It is highly endothermic and equilibrium-limited due to H2 coproduction, requiring high reaction temperatures. PDH catalysts also deactivate quickly from carbon deposition, necessitating expensive reactor designs for frequent catalyst regeneration. These factors impact the economic viability and environmental footprint of PDH.

The literature does not provide specific information on the economic and environmental advantages of PDH compared to other methods. It focuses more on the challenges of PDH, suggesting that while it helps meet demand, it may not offer significant economic or environmental benefits over traditional methods without further improvements.

丙烯在化工行业的重要性已经发生了演变,这是由于供需之间日益扩大的差距。由于乙烷裂解这种传统的生产方法只能生产有限数量的较重的烯烃(如丙烯),因此出现了需求增长超过裂解装置供应的情况。

为了填补这一缺口,丙烷脱氢(PDH)已被采用为首选生产方法。PDH使用铂或铬基催化剂,具有高丙烯选择性。这种方法有助于满足化工行业各种应用对丙烯日益增长的需求。

然而,PDH也存在一些经济和环境方面的缺点。由于副产氢气,PDH反应高度吸热且受平衡限制,需要高反应温度。PDH催化剂也会因碳沉积而快速失活,需要昂贵的反应器设计以实现频繁的催化剂再生。这些因素影响了PDH的经济可行性和环境影响。

文献并未提供PDH与其他方法相比在经济和环境方面的具体优势信息。它更多地关注PDH的挑战,这表明虽然PDH有助于满足需求,但如果没有进一步改进,它可能不会比传统方法提供显著的经济或环境效益。

Propene's significance in the chemical industry has evolved due to a growing gap between its supply from traditional cracking processes and increasing demand. This gap has emerged because ethane cracking, which has become more prevalent due to the abundance of natural gas, produces very little propylene compared to naphtha cracking.

To address this supply-demand imbalance, on-purpose propylene production methods like propane dehydrogenation (PDH) have been adopted. PDH is preferred because it offers high propylene selectivity using platinum- or chromium-based catalysts.

However, PDH has some economic and environmental drawbacks. It is highly endothermic, requiring high reaction temperatures, which increases energy costs. The process is also equilibrium-limited due to hydrogen co-production. Additionally, PDH catalysts deactivate quickly from carbon deposition, necessitating expensive reactor designs for frequent catalyst regeneration.

The literature does not provide specific information on the economic and environmental advantages of PDH in meeting growing propylene needs across various applications. However, it can be inferred that despite its drawbacks, PDH is still considered a viable solution to bridge the propylene supply gap, likely due to its high selectivity and the abundance of propane feedstock from natural gas.

丙烯在化工行业的重要性已经发生了变化，这是由于传统裂解工艺的供应与日益增长的需求之间出现了差距。这种差距的出现是因为乙烷裂解（由于天然气的丰富而变得更加普遍）与石脑油裂解相比，产生的丙烯量很少。

为了解决这种供需不平衡，已经采用了诸如丙烷脱氢（PDH）等定向丙烯生产方法。PDH之所以受到青睐，是因为它使用铂基或铬基催化剂可以提供高丙烯选择性。

然而，PDH也存在一些经济和环境方面的缺点。它是高度吸热的，需要高反应温度，这增加了能源成本。由于副产氢气，该过程也受到平衡限制。此外，PDH催化剂由于碳沉积而迅速失活，需要昂贵的反应器设计以进行频繁的催化剂再生。

文献中没有提供PDH在满足各种应用中日益增长的丙烯需求方面的具体经济和环境优势信息。然而，可以推断，尽管存在缺点，PDH仍被认为是弥补丙烯供应缺口的可行解决方案，这可能是由于其高选择性和天然气中丙烷原料的丰富性。

Propene's significance in the chemical industry has evolved due to a growing gap between supply from traditional cracking processes and increasing demand. As ethane cracking produces limited amounts of heavier olefins like propylene, there is now insufficient propylene supply from crackers to meet demand.

This supply-demand gap has driven the adoption of propane dehydrogenation (PDH) as a preferred "on-purpose" propylene production method. PDH offers high propylene selectivity using platinum or chromium catalysts. 

However, PDH has some economic and environmental drawbacks. It is highly endothermic, requiring high temperatures. The catalysts also deactivate quickly due to coking, necessitating expensive reactor designs for frequent regeneration. The literature does not provide specific information on the economic or environmental advantages of PDH compared to other methods in meeting growing propylene needs across applications.

丙烯在化工行业的重要性已经发生了变化，这是由于传统裂解工艺的供应和不断增长的需求之间存在日益扩大的差距。由于乙烷裂解生产的重质烯烃如丙烯的量有限，现在裂解装置无法提供足够的丙烯来满足需求。

这种供需差距推动了丙烷脱氢(PDH)作为首选的"定向"丙烯生产方法的采用。PDH使用铂或铬催化剂提供高丙烯选择性。

然而，PDH也有一些经济和环境方面的缺点。它是高度吸热的，需要高温。催化剂也会因结焦而快速失活，需要昂贵的反应器设计以便频繁再生。文献没有提供PDH相比其他方法在满足各种应用中不断增长的丙烯需求方面的具体经济或环境优势信息。

Propene's significance in the chemical industry has evolved due to a growing gap between supply and demand. While ethane cracking produces limited amounts of heavier olefins like propylene, the demand for propylene has increased. This mismatch has driven the adoption of on-purpose propylene production methods, particularly propane dehydrogenation (PDH).

PDH has become a preferred production method due to its high propylene selectivity using platinum- or chromium-based catalysts. However, it comes with certain disadvantages, including being highly endothermic, equilibrium-limited due to H2 coproduction, and requiring high reaction temperatures. PDH catalysts also suffer from rapid deactivation caused by carbon (coke) deposition, necessitating capital-intensive reactor designs for semi-continuous catalyst regeneration.

The economic advantages of PDH in meeting growing propylene needs are not explicitly stated in the given text. However, it can be inferred that PDH's ability to produce propylene selectively helps address the supply-demand gap more effectively than traditional cracking methods. Environmental advantages are not mentioned in the provided literature.

丙烯在化工行业的重要性随着供需差距的扩大而演变。虽然乙烷裂解产生的重烯烃如丙烯量有限，但丙烯的需求却在增加。这种不匹配推动了定向丙烯生产方法的采用，特别是丙烷脱氢（PDH）。

PDH之所以成为首选的生产方法，是因为它使用铂或铬基催化剂可以高选择性地生产丙烯。然而，它也有一些缺点，包括高度吸热、由于副产H2而受平衡限制，并且需要高反应温度。PDH催化剂还因碳（焦炭）沉积而快速失活，需要资本密集型反应器设计来实现半连续催化剂再生。

文中没有明确说明PDH在满足不断增长的丙烯需求方面的经济优势。但可以推断，与传统裂解方法相比，PDH选择性生产丙烯的能力有助于更有效地解决供需差距。文献中没有提到环境优势。
