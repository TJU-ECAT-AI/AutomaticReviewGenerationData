[1] "As ethane cracking only produces sparing amounts of olefins heavier than ethylene [1], a gap between the supply of propylene from crackers and the demand for propylene has emerged [2]."

[2] "To fill this gap, so-called on-purpose propylene production processes have been implemented such as propane dehydrogenation (PDH) which benefits from high propylene selectivity from catalysts that are typically platinum- or chromium-based [3]."

[3] "However, these processes also have significant disadvantages. PDH is highly endothermic and equilibrium-limited owing to the coproduction of H2, thus high reaction temperatures are required to drive conversion. Additionally, PDH catalysts deactivate rapidly due to the deposition of carbon (coke) on the surface and capital-intensive reactor designs allowing for semi-continuous catalyst regeneration have been engineered to work around this caveat."

Propene's significance in the chemical industry has evolved due to a growing gap between supply from traditional cracking processes and increasing demand. As ethane cracking produces limited amounts of heavier olefins like propylene, there is now insufficient propylene supply from crackers to meet demand.

This supply-demand gap has driven the adoption of propane dehydrogenation (PDH) as a preferred "on-purpose" propylene production method. PDH offers high propylene selectivity using platinum or chromium catalysts. 

However, PDH has some economic and environmental drawbacks. It is highly endothermic, requiring high temperatures. The catalysts also deactivate quickly due to coking, necessitating expensive reactor designs for frequent regeneration. The literature does not provide specific information on the economic or environmental advantages of PDH compared to other methods in meeting growing propylene needs across applications.

丙烯在化工行业的重要性已经发生了变化，这是由于传统裂解工艺的供应和不断增长的需求之间存在日益扩大的差距。由于乙烷裂解生产的重质烯烃如丙烯的量有限，现在裂解装置无法提供足够的丙烯来满足需求。

这种供需差距推动了丙烷脱氢(PDH)作为首选的"定向"丙烯生产方法的采用。PDH使用铂或铬催化剂提供高丙烯选择性。

然而，PDH也有一些经济和环境方面的缺点。它是高度吸热的，需要高温。催化剂也会因结焦而快速失活，需要昂贵的反应器设计以便频繁再生。文献没有提供PDH相比其他方法在满足各种应用中不断增长的丙烯需求方面的具体经济或环境优势信息。
