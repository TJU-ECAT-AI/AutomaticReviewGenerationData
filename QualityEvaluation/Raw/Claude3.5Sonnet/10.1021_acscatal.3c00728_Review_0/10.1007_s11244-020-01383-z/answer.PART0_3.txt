[1] "As ethane cracking only produces sparing amounts of olefins heavier than ethylene [1], a gap between the supply of propylene from crackers and the demand for propylene has emerged [2]."

[2] "To fill this gap, so-called on-purpose propylene production processes have been implemented such as propane dehydrogenation (PDH) which benefits from high propylene selectivity from catalysts that are typically platinum- or chromium-based [3]."

[3] "However, these processes also have significant disadvantages. PDH is highly endothermic and equilibrium-limited owing to the coproduction of H2, thus high reaction temperatures are required to drive conversion. Additionally, PDH catalysts deactivate rapidly due to the deposition of carbon (coke) on the surface and capital-intensive reactor designs allowing for semi-continuous catalyst regeneration have been engineered to work around this caveat."

Propene's significance in the chemical industry has evolved due to a growing gap between supply and demand. While ethane cracking produces limited amounts of heavier olefins like propylene, the demand for propylene has increased. This mismatch has driven the adoption of on-purpose propylene production methods, particularly propane dehydrogenation (PDH).

PDH has become a preferred production method due to its high propylene selectivity using platinum- or chromium-based catalysts. However, it comes with certain disadvantages, including being highly endothermic, equilibrium-limited due to H2 coproduction, and requiring high reaction temperatures. PDH catalysts also suffer from rapid deactivation caused by carbon (coke) deposition, necessitating capital-intensive reactor designs for semi-continuous catalyst regeneration.

The economic advantages of PDH in meeting growing propylene needs are not explicitly stated in the given text. However, it can be inferred that PDH's ability to produce propylene selectively helps address the supply-demand gap more effectively than traditional cracking methods. Environmental advantages are not mentioned in the provided literature.

丙烯在化工行业的重要性随着供需差距的扩大而演变。虽然乙烷裂解产生的重烯烃如丙烯量有限，但丙烯的需求却在增加。这种不匹配推动了定向丙烯生产方法的采用，特别是丙烷脱氢（PDH）。

PDH之所以成为首选的生产方法，是因为它使用铂或铬基催化剂可以高选择性地生产丙烯。然而，它也有一些缺点，包括高度吸热、由于副产H2而受平衡限制，并且需要高反应温度。PDH催化剂还因碳（焦炭）沉积而快速失活，需要资本密集型反应器设计来实现半连续催化剂再生。

文中没有明确说明PDH在满足不断增长的丙烯需求方面的经济优势。但可以推断，与传统裂解方法相比，PDH选择性生产丙烯的能力有助于更有效地解决供需差距。文献中没有提到环境优势。
