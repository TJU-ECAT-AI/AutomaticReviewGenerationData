[1] "As ethane cracking only produces sparing amounts of olefins heavier than ethylene [1], a gap between the supply of propylene from crackers and the demand for propylene has emerged [2]."

[2] "To fill this gap, so-called on-purpose propylene production processes have been implemented such as propane dehydrogenation (PDH) which benefits from high propylene selectivity from catalysts that are typically platinum- or chromium-based [3]."

[3] "However, these processes also have significant disadvantages. PDH is highly endothermic and equilibrium-limited owing to the coproduction of H2, thus high reaction temperatures are required to drive conversion. Additionally, PDH catalysts deactivate rapidly due to the deposition of carbon (coke) on the surface and capital-intensive reactor designs allowing for semi-continuous catalyst regeneration have been engineered to work around this caveat."

Propene's significance in the chemical industry has evolved due to a growing gap between supply and demand. As ethane cracking, a traditional production method, produces limited amounts of heavier olefins like propylene, there has been an increasing demand that outpaces supply from crackers.

To address this gap, propane dehydrogenation (PDH) has been adopted as a preferred production method. PDH offers high propylene selectivity using platinum- or chromium-based catalysts. This approach helps meet the growing needs for propylene across various applications in the chemical industry.

However, PDH has some economic and environmental drawbacks. It is highly endothermic and equilibrium-limited due to H2 coproduction, requiring high reaction temperatures. PDH catalysts also deactivate quickly from carbon deposition, necessitating expensive reactor designs for frequent catalyst regeneration. These factors impact the economic viability and environmental footprint of PDH.

The literature does not provide specific information on the economic and environmental advantages of PDH compared to other methods. It focuses more on the challenges of PDH, suggesting that while it helps meet demand, it may not offer significant economic or environmental benefits over traditional methods without further improvements.

丙烯在化工行业的重要性已经发生了演变,这是由于供需之间日益扩大的差距。由于乙烷裂解这种传统的生产方法只能生产有限数量的较重的烯烃(如丙烯),因此出现了需求增长超过裂解装置供应的情况。

为了填补这一缺口,丙烷脱氢(PDH)已被采用为首选生产方法。PDH使用铂或铬基催化剂,具有高丙烯选择性。这种方法有助于满足化工行业各种应用对丙烯日益增长的需求。

然而,PDH也存在一些经济和环境方面的缺点。由于副产氢气,PDH反应高度吸热且受平衡限制,需要高反应温度。PDH催化剂也会因碳沉积而快速失活,需要昂贵的反应器设计以实现频繁的催化剂再生。这些因素影响了PDH的经济可行性和环境影响。

文献并未提供PDH与其他方法相比在经济和环境方面的具体优势信息。它更多地关注PDH的挑战,这表明虽然PDH有助于满足需求,但如果没有进一步改进,它可能不会比传统方法提供显著的经济或环境效益。
