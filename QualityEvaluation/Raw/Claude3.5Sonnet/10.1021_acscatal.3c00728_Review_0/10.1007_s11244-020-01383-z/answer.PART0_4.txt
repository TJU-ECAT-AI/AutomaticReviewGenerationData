[1] "As ethane cracking only produces sparing amounts of olefins heavier than ethylene [1], a gap between the supply of propylene from crackers and the demand for propylene has emerged [2]."

[2] "To fill this gap, so-called on-purpose propylene production processes have been implemented such as propane dehydrogenation (PDH) which benefits from high propylene selectivity from catalysts that are typically platinum- or chromium-based [3]."

[3] "However, these processes also have significant disadvantages. PDH is highly endothermic and equilibrium-limited owing to the coproduction of H2, thus high reaction temperatures are required to drive conversion. Additionally, PDH catalysts deactivate rapidly due to the deposition of carbon (coke) on the surface and capital-intensive reactor designs allowing for semi-continuous catalyst regeneration have been engineered to work around this caveat."

Propene's significance in the chemical industry has evolved due to a growing gap between supply and demand. As ethane cracking produces limited amounts of heavier olefins like propylene, there is insufficient propylene supply from traditional cracking processes to meet increasing demand.

To address this gap, on-purpose propylene production methods like propane dehydrogenation (PDH) have been adopted. PDH offers high propylene selectivity using platinum or chromium-based catalysts. 

However, PDH has some disadvantages. It is highly endothermic and equilibrium-limited due to H2 coproduction, requiring high reaction temperatures. PDH catalysts also deactivate quickly from carbon deposition, necessitating expensive reactor designs for frequent catalyst regeneration.

The economic advantages of PDH include its ability to produce propylene selectively to meet growing demand. However, the high temperatures and frequent catalyst regeneration required add to operating costs. Environmental advantages are not explicitly stated in the given text.

The literature does not provide specific information on the various applications driving propylene demand growth. More context would be needed to fully address that aspect of the question.

丙烯在化工行业的重要性已经发生了变化,这是由于供需之间日益扩大的差距。由于乙烷裂解只能生产有限数量的重质烯烃(如丙烯),传统的裂解工艺无法提供足够的丙烯来满足不断增长的需求。

为了填补这一缺口,采用了定向丙烯生产方法,如丙烷脱氢(PDH)。PDH使用铂或铬基催化剂,具有较高的丙烯选择性。

然而,PDH也存在一些缺点。由于副产品H2的生成,该过程高度吸热且受平衡限制,需要高反应温度。PDH催化剂也会因碳沉积而快速失活,需要昂贵的反应器设计来频繁再生催化剂。

PDH的经济优势包括能够选择性地生产丙烯以满足不断增长的需求。但是,所需的高温和频繁的催化剂再生会增加运营成本。文中并未明确说明环境优势。

文献中并未提供有关推动丙烯需求增长的各种应用的具体信息。需要更多背景信息才能全面回答该问题的这一方面。
