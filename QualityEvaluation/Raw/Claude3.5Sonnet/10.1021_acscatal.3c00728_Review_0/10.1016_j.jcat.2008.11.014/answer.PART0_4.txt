Propylene has become an increasingly important feedstock in the petrochemical industry, particularly for producing polypropylene. The growing demand for propylene has outpaced the supply from traditional sources like fluid catalytic cracking (FCC). As a result, propane dehydrogenation (PDH) has emerged as a significant on-purpose production method to bridge this supply gap. PDH offers advantages in terms of feedstock flexibility and potentially improved economics compared to traditional cracking processes. It allows for more targeted propylene production to meet specific market demands. Additionally, PDH plants can be built closer to shale gas sources, reducing transportation costs. From an environmental perspective, PDH may offer benefits in terms of energy efficiency and reduced carbon emissions compared to steam cracking. However, the literature does not provide specific details on the economic or environmental advantages of PDH.

丙烯已成为石油化工行业越来越重要的原料，尤其是用于生产聚丙烯。丙烯的需求增长已超过了传统来源(如流化催化裂化FCC)的供应。因此，丙烷脱氢(PDH)已成为一种重要的定向生产方法，以弥补这一供应缺口。与传统的裂解工艺相比，PDH在原料灵活性和潜在的经济性方面具有优势。它允许更有针对性地生产丙烯以满足特定的市场需求。此外，PDH装置可以建在更靠近页岩气源的地方，从而降低运输成本。从环境角度来看，与蒸汽裂解相比，PDH可能在能源效率和减少碳排放方面提供益处。然而，文献中并未提供PDH在经济或环境方面优势的具体细节。
