[1] "Propylene is an important building block in a myriad of (petro)chemical applications, for instance in the production of polypropylene"

[2] "Dehydrogenation of propane (DHP) is one of the on-purpose propylene production technologies that has received much attention in the recent past due to it's potential to make-up the shortfall of propylene supply left by conventional crackers (e.g., FCC)"

[3] "Typically, the CrOxAl2O3 catalyst system is used for industrial processes, for example in the Catofin process (ABB Lummus) that runs at cyclic operation (reaction and regeneration) at 850 K"

[4] "However, major challenges associated with this catalytic system are cracking and coking which influence the product selectivity and catalyst stability, respectively. Thus, the deactivated catalyst must frequently be regenerated without losing dehydrogenation activity, selectivity to propylene and catalyst stability, which makes the process not only complex but also expensive."

Propene's significance in the chemical industry has grown due to its importance as a building block in various petrochemical applications, particularly in the production of polypropylene. The increasing demand for propene has driven the adoption of propane dehydrogenation (DHP) as a preferred production method because it can help address the shortfall in propene supply from conventional cracking processes.

The economic advantages of DHP include its ability to produce propene on-demand, helping to meet growing needs across various applications. This on-purpose production method allows for more targeted and efficient propene manufacturing compared to traditional cracking processes.

However, there are challenges associated with the current catalytic systems used in DHP, such as cracking and coking, which affect product selectivity and catalyst stability. These issues necessitate frequent catalyst regeneration, making the process complex and expensive. Therefore, while DHP offers advantages in meeting propene demand, there is still room for improvement in terms of process efficiency and cost-effectiveness.

The environmental advantages of DHP are not explicitly mentioned in the given text. However, it can be inferred that as an on-purpose production method, DHP might allow for more controlled and potentially less wasteful propene production compared to obtaining it as a byproduct from other processes.

丙烯在化工行业的重要性日益增长，因为它是各种石油化工应用的重要组成部分，特别是在聚丙烯生产中。丙烯需求的增加推动了丙烷脱氢(DHP)作为首选生产方法的采用，因为它可以帮助解决传统裂解工艺中丙烯供应不足的问题。

DHP的经济优势包括其按需生产丙烯的能力，有助于满足各种应用领域日益增长的需求。与传统的裂解工艺相比，这种定向生产方法允许更有针对性和高效的丙烯生产。

然而，DHP当前使用的催化系统存在一些挑战，如裂解和结焦，这些问题影响产品选择性和催化剂稳定性。这些问题需要频繁进行催化剂再生，使得该过程变得复杂且昂贵。因此，虽然DHP在满足丙烯需求方面具有优势，但在工艺效率和成本效益方面仍有改进的空间。

文中并未明确提及DHP的环境优势。然而，可以推断，作为一种定向生产方法，与从其他工艺中获得丙烯作为副产品相比，DHP可能允许更加受控且潜在地减少浪费的丙烯生产。
