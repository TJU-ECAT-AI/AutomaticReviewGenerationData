Propylene has become increasingly significant in the chemical industry as an important building block for many petrochemical applications, particularly in the production of polypropylene. The growing demand for propylene has led to increased interest in propane dehydrogenation (DHP) as a preferred production method. This technology has gained attention recently due to its potential to address the shortfall in propylene supply from conventional production methods like fluid catalytic cracking (FCC).

DHP offers economic and environmental advantages in meeting the growing needs for propylene across various applications. As an on-purpose production technology, it allows for more targeted and efficient propylene production compared to traditional cracking processes. This can help chemical manufacturers better match supply with demand. Additionally, DHP potentially offers improved selectivity and yield of propylene compared to FCC, which produces a mixture of products. From an environmental perspective, DHP may result in lower overall emissions and energy usage compared to extracting propylene from mixed hydrocarbon streams. However, the document does not provide specific details on the economic or environmental benefits, so these advantages are inferred based on the nature of the technology.

丙烯作为许多石油化工应用的重要建筑材料，特别是在聚丙烯生产中，在化学工业中的重要性日益增加。丙烯需求的增长导致人们对丙烷脱氢(DHP)作为首选生产方法的兴趣增加。这项技术最近受到关注，因为它有潜力弥补传统生产方法（如流化催化裂化FCC）所造成的丙烯供应短缺。

DHP在满足各种应用对丙烯日益增长的需求方面具有经济和环境优势。作为一种定向生产技术，与传统的裂解工艺相比，它允许更有针对性和更高效的丙烯生产。这可以帮助化学品制造商更好地使供应与需求相匹配。此外，与生产混合产品的FCC相比，DHP可能提供更高的丙烯选择性和产率。从环境角度来看，与从混合烃流中提取丙烯相比，DHP可能会导致更低的总体排放和能源使用。然而，文档没有提供具体的经济或环境效益细节，因此这些优势是根据技术的性质推断出来的。
