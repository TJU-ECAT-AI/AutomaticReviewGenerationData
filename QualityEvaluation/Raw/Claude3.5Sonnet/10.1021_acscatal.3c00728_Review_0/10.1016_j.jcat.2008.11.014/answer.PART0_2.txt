Propylene has become increasingly important as a building block in various petrochemical applications, particularly in the production of polypropylene. The growing demand for propylene has outpaced the supply from conventional production methods like fluid catalytic cracking (FCC). As a result, propane dehydrogenation (DHP) has emerged as a significant on-purpose propylene production technology to address this supply shortfall.

DHP offers several advantages as a propylene production method. It allows for targeted, on-demand propylene production to meet market needs. The process is also more efficient and selective compared to traditional cracking methods. Economically, DHP enables petrochemical producers to capitalize on the relatively low cost of propane feedstock, especially in regions with abundant natural gas resources.

From an environmental perspective, DHP is generally considered a cleaner process than some alternatives, as it produces fewer byproducts and can potentially have a lower carbon footprint when optimized. The use of catalysts like chromium oxide on alumina (CrOx/Al2O3) in industrial DHP processes, such as the Catofin process, allows for efficient conversion at moderate temperatures around 850 K.

However, challenges remain in terms of catalyst deactivation and the need for periodic regeneration, which impacts process economics and complexity. Ongoing research aims to improve catalyst performance, stability, and process efficiency to further enhance the viability of DHP as a key technology for meeting the growing global demand for propylene across diverse applications.

丙烯作为各种石化应用的重要建筑块，其重要性日益增加，特别是在聚丙烯的生产中。丙烯的需求增长已经超过了传统生产方法（如流化催化裂化FCC）的供应能力。因此，丙烷脱氢（DHP）作为一种重要的定向丙烯生产技术应运而生，以解决这一供应短缺问题。

DHP作为丙烯生产方法具有多项优势。它允许根据市场需求进行有针对性的、按需丙烯生产。与传统的裂解方法相比，这个过程更高效、更具选择性。从经济角度来看，DHP使石化生产商能够利用相对低成本的丙烷原料，特别是在天然气资源丰富的地区。

从环境角度来看，DHP通常被认为是一种比某些替代方法更清洁的工艺，因为它产生的副产品较少，并且在优化后可能具有较低的碳足迹。在工业DHP工艺中使用氧化铬/氧化铝（CrOx/Al2O3）等催化剂，如Catofin工艺，可以在约850 K的适度温度下实现高效转化。

然而，在催化剂失活和需要定期再生方面仍然存在挑战，这影响了工艺经济性和复杂性。正在进行的研究旨在改善催化剂性能、稳定性和工艺效率，以进一步提高DHP作为满足全球各种应用领域日益增长的丙烯需求的关键技术的可行性。
