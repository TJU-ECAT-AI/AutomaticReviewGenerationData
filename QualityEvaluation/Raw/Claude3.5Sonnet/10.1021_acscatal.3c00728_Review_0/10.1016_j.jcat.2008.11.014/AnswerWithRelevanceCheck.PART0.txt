          [1] "Propylene is an important building block in a myriad of (petro)chemical applications, for instance in the production of polypropylene"

          [2] "Dehydrogenation of propane (DHP) is one of the on-purpose propylene production technologies that has received much attention in the recent past"

          [3] "due to it's potential to make-up the shortfall of propylene supply left by conventional crackers (e.g., FCC)"

          [4] "Typically, the CrOxAl2O3 catalyst system is used for industrial processes, for example in the Catofin process (ABB Lummus) that runs at cyclic operation (reaction and regeneration) at 850 K"

          [5] "However, major challenges associated with this catalytic system are cracking and coking which influence the product selectivity and catalyst stability, respectively. Thus, the deactivated catalyst must frequently be regenerated without losing dehydrogenation activity, selectivity to propylene and catalyst stability, which makes the process not only complex but also expensive."

          Propene's significance in the chemical industry has evolved due to its importance as a building block in various petrochemical applications, particularly in the production of polypropylene. The increasing demand for propene has driven the adoption of propane dehydrogenation (DHP) as a preferred production method because it can help address the shortfall in propene supply from conventional cracking processes like fluid catalytic cracking (FCC).

          Economic advantages of DHP include:
          1. On-demand production to meet growing needs across various applications
          2. More targeted and efficient propene manufacturing compared to traditional cracking processes
          3. Utilization of propane feedstock from natural gas liquids, providing a cost-effective route
          4. Ability to scale and strategically locate plants to serve regional markets

          Environmental advantages of DHP include:
          1. Potentially lower carbon footprint compared to steam cracking of naphtha
          2. Fewer carbon-containing byproducts due to the targeted nature of the reaction
          3. Lower operating temperatures than steam crackers, reducing energy requirements and associated emissions
          4. More controlled and potentially less wasteful production compared to obtaining propene as a byproduct

          However, challenges remain with the current catalytic systems used in DHP, such as:
          1. Cracking and coking issues affecting product selectivity and catalyst stability
          2. Need for frequent catalyst regeneration, making the process complex and expensive
          3. Ongoing research to improve catalyst performance, stability, and process efficiency

          The industrial process typically uses a CrOxAl2O3 catalyst system, as seen in the Catofin process, which operates at 850 K in cyclic operation (reaction and regeneration).

          丙烯在化工行业的重要性日益增长，因为它是各种石油化工应用的重要组成部分，特别是在聚丙烯生产中。丙烯需求的增加推动了丙烷脱氢(DHP)作为首选生产方法的采用，因为它可以帮助解决传统裂解工艺（如流化催化裂化FCC）中丙烯供应不足的问题。

          DHP的经济优势包括：
          1. 按需生产，满足各种应用领域日益增长的需求
          2. 与传统裂解工艺相比，更有针对性和高效的丙烯生产
          3. 利用来自天然气液体的丙烷原料，提供一种具有成本效益的生产途径
          4. 能够进行规模调整，并战略性地布局工厂以服务区域市场

          DHP的环境优势包括：
          1. 与石脑油蒸汽裂解相比，潜在的碳足迹更低
          2. 由于反应的针对性，产生较少的含碳副产品
          3. 比蒸汽裂解装置的操作温度更低，减少了能源需求和相关排放
          4. 与作为副产品获得丙烯相比，生产过程更受控制，潜在地减少浪费

          然而，DHP当前使用的催化系统仍存在一些挑战，如：
          1. 裂解和结焦问题影响产品选择性和催化剂稳定性
          2. 需要频繁进行催化剂再生，使得该过程变得复杂且昂贵
          3. 正在进行研究以改善催化剂性能、稳定性和工艺效率

          工业过程通常使用CrOxAl2O3催化剂系统，如Catofin工艺，在850 K下进行循环操作（反应和再生）。
