Propene has become increasingly significant in the chemical industry as the second most important olefin building block and raw material. It is used to produce a wide range of value-added chemicals and polymer products, including polypropylene, propylene oxide, acrylonitrile, acrylic acid, isopropylbenzene, and butyl alcohol. The growing demand for propene is driven by the development of the modern chemical industry and the increased consumption of high-value-added products.

Propane dehydrogenation has emerged as a preferred production method for propene due to its economic viability and environmental friendliness compared to other existing technologies. This approach is better suited to meet the growing needs for propene across various applications in a cost-effective and sustainable manner.
