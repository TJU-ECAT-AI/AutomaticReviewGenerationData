Propene's significance in the chemical industry has evolved to become the second most important olefin building block and raw material. It is extensively used in the production of various value-added chemicals and polymer products, including polypropylene, propylene oxide, acrylonitrile, acrylic acid, isopropylbenzene, and butyl alcohol. The increasing demand for propene is driven by the development of the modern chemical industry and the growing consumption of high-value-added products.

Propane dehydrogenation has emerged as a preferred production method for propene due to its economic viability and environmental friendliness compared to other existing technologies. This approach is better suited to meet the growing needs for this versatile olefin across various applications in a more sustainable and cost-effective manner.
