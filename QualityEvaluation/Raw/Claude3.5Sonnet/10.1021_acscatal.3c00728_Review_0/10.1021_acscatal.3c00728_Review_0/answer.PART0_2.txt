[1] "Propene, the second most important olefin building block and raw material in the chemical industry, is widely used to prepare value-added chemicals and polymer products such as polypropylene, propylene oxide, acrylonitrile, acrylic acid, isopropylbenzene, and butyl alcohol."

[2] "With the development of the modern chemical industry and the increase in consumption of high-value-added products, the annual demand for propene is increasing."

[3] "Among the existing propene production technologies, the synthesis of propene through propane dehydrogenation is more economically viable and environmentally friendly."

[4] "Compared with the direct dehydrogenation of propane, oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propene (ODHP) requires a lower reaction temperature owing to the exothermicity of the oxidation reaction. This characteristic of ODHP exhibits considerable advantages and broad prospects for the efficient and continuous conversion of propane to propene."

Propene's significance in the chemical industry has evolved to become the second most important olefin building block and raw material. It is widely used in the production of various value-added chemicals and polymer products, including polypropylene, propylene oxide, acrylonitrile, acrylic acid, isopropylbenzene, and butyl alcohol. The increasing demand for propene is driven by the development of the modern chemical industry and the growing consumption of high-value-added products.

The adoption of propane dehydrogenation as a preferred production method is driven by its economic viability and environmental friendliness compared to other existing propene production technologies. Specifically, oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propene (ODHP) offers additional advantages, such as requiring lower reaction temperatures due to the exothermicity of the oxidation reaction. This characteristic of ODHP provides considerable benefits and broad prospects for efficient and continuous conversion of propane to propene, making it an attractive option to meet the growing needs for this versatile olefin across various applications.

丙烯在化学工业中的重要性已发展成为第二重要的烯烃建筑块和原材料。它被广泛用于生产各种高附加值化学品和聚合物产品，包括聚丙烯、丙烯氧化物、丙烯腈、丙烯酸、异丙苯和丁醇。丙烯需求的增加是由现代化学工业的发展和高附加值产品消费的增长所驱动的。

采用丙烷脱氢作为首选生产方法是由于它相比其他现有的丙烯生产技术具有经济可行性和环境友好性。具体而言，丙烷氧化脱氢制丙烯（ODHP）提供了额外的优势，如由于氧化反应的放热性而需要较低的反应温度。ODHP的这一特性为高效和连续地将丙烷转化为丙烯提供了相当大的好处和广阔的前景，使其成为满足这种多用途烯烃在各种应用中不断增长的需求的一个有吸引力的选择。
