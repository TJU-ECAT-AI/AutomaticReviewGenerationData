Propene's significance in the chemical industry has evolved to become the second most important olefin building block and raw material. It is widely used in the production of various value-added chemicals and polymer products, including polypropylene, propylene oxide, acrylonitrile, acrylic acid, isopropylbenzene, and butyl alcohol. The increasing demand for propene is driven by the development of the modern chemical industry and the growing consumption of high-value-added products.

The adoption of propane dehydrogenation as a preferred production method is driven by its economic viability and environmental friendliness compared to other existing propene production technologies. This approach helps meet the growing needs for propene across various applications in a more sustainable and cost-effective manner.
