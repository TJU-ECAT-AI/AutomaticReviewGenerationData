[3] "Among the existing propene production technologies, the synthesis of propene through propane dehydrogenation is more economically viable and environmentally friendly."

[4] "Compared with the direct dehydrogenation of propane, oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propene (ODHP) requires a lower reaction temperature owing to the exothermicity of the oxidation reaction. This characteristic of ODHP exhibits considerable advantages and broad prospects for the efficient and continuous conversion of propane to propene."
