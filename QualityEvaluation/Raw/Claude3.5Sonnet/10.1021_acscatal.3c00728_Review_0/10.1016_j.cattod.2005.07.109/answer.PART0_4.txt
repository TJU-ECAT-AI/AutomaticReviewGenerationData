[1] "Propylene is the key building block for the production of important petrochemicals, such as polypropylene, acrylonitrile, propylene oxide, cumene, phenol, isopropylic alcohol and many others"

[2] "As shown in Fig. 1, propylene worldwide demand has been increasing at an annual average of 5.7% since 1990; by year 2000, propylene production was about 52 million tonnes, and it is projected that by year 2010, demand will grow to 84 million tonnes, due to the increasing polypropylene demand"

[3] "Currently, about 70% of propylene worldwide production comes from steam crackers, 28% from refinery fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) units and 2% from specific on-purpose processes, such as propane dehydrogenation, metathesis and others."

[4] "It is expected that in order to cover the future demand, the propylene market share from other processes than steam cracking will importantly grow, since it is forecast that propylene market will grow faster than ethylene market"

Propylene's significance in the chemical industry has grown substantially over the years. It is a key building block for many important petrochemicals, including polypropylene, acrylonitrile, and propylene oxide. The demand for propylene has been increasing steadily, with an annual average growth rate of 5.7% since 1990. By 2000, propylene production was around 52 million tonnes, and it was projected to reach 84 million tonnes by 2010, primarily driven by the increasing demand for polypropylene.

However, the literature does not specifically discuss propane dehydrogenation as a preferred production method or its economic and environmental advantages. Instead, it mentions that currently, most propylene (70%) comes from steam crackers, with 28% from fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) units, and only 2% from specific on-purpose processes, which include propane dehydrogenation.

The document suggests that to meet future demand, production methods other than steam cracking will need to grow in importance, as the propylene market is expected to grow faster than the ethylene market. However, it does not provide specific details about the advantages of propane dehydrogenation or its adoption rate.

丙烯在化工行业的重要性多年来显著增长。它是许多重要石化产品的关键原料，包括聚丙烯、丙烯腈和环氧丙烷。丙烯的需求一直稳步增长，自1990年以来年均增长率为5.7%。到2000年，丙烯产量约为5200万吨，预计到2010年将达到8400万吨，主要是由于聚丙烯需求的增加。

然而，文献并未特别讨论丙烷脱氢作为首选生产方法，或其经济和环境优势。相反，它提到目前大部分丙烯（70%）来自蒸汽裂解装置，28%来自流化催化裂化（FCC）装置，只有2%来自特定的定向工艺，其中包括丙烷脱氢。

文档表明，为满足未来需求，除蒸汽裂解外的其他生产方法需要变得更加重要，因为丙烯市场预计将比乙烯市场增长更快。但是，它没有提供关于丙烷脱氢的具体优势或其采用率的详细信息。
