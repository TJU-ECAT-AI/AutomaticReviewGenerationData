Propene's significance in the chemical industry has grown substantially over the years. It is a key building block for many important petrochemicals, including polypropylene, acrylonitrile, and propylene oxide. The demand for propylene has been increasing rapidly, with an average annual growth rate of 5.7% since 1990. By 2000, propylene production was about 52 million tonnes, and it was projected to reach 84 million tonnes by 2010, largely driven by increasing demand for polypropylene.

However, the literature does not specifically discuss propane dehydrogenation as a preferred production method for meeting this growing demand. Instead, it mentions that currently, about 70% of worldwide propylene production comes from steam crackers, 28% from refinery fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) units, and only 2% from specific on-purpose processes, which include propane dehydrogenation among others.

The document suggests that to meet future demand, the market share of propylene from processes other than steam cracking is expected to grow significantly. This is because the propylene market is forecast to grow faster than the ethylene market. However, the economic and environmental advantages of propane dehydrogenation are not specifically discussed in the given literature.

The text focuses more on alternative methods to increase propylene production, particularly through modifications to the FCC process and reprocessing of light FCC naphtha, rather than on propane dehydrogenation.

丙烯在化工行业的重要性多年来已大幅增长。它是许多重要石化产品的关键原料，包括聚丙烯、丙烯腈和环氧丙烷。丙烯的需求一直在快速增长，自1990年以来年均增长率达5.7%。到2000年，丙烯产量约为5200万吨，预计到2010年将达到8400万吨，主要是由于聚丙烯需求的增加。

然而，文献并未特别讨论丙烷脱氢作为满足这一不断增长需求的首选生产方法。相反，它提到目前全球丙烯产量约70%来自蒸汽裂解装置，28%来自炼油厂流化催化裂化（FCC）装置，只有2%来自特定的定向工艺，其中包括丙烷脱氢等。

文件表明，为满足未来需求，预计来自蒸汽裂解以外工艺的丙烯市场份额将显著增长。这是因为预计丙烯市场的增长速度将快于乙烯市场。然而，给定的文献中并未具体讨论丙烷脱氢的经济和环境优势。

该文本更多地关注通过改进FCC工艺和重新处理轻质FCC石脑油来增加丙烯产量的替代方法，而不是丙烷脱氢。
