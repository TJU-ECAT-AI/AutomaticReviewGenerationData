Propylene's significance in the chemical industry has grown substantially over the years. It is a key building block for numerous important petrochemicals, including polypropylene, acrylonitrile, propylene oxide, and others. The demand for propylene has been increasing steadily, with an annual average growth of 5.7% since 1990. By 2000, propylene production reached about 52 million tonnes, and it was projected to grow to 84 million tonnes by 2010, primarily driven by increasing demand for polypropylene.

However, the literature does not specifically address propane dehydrogenation as a preferred production method or its economic and environmental advantages. Instead, it mentions that currently, 70% of worldwide propylene production comes from steam crackers, 28% from refinery fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) units, and only 2% from specific on-purpose processes, which include propane dehydrogenation among others.

The document suggests that to meet future demand, the market share of propylene from processes other than steam cracking is expected to grow significantly. This is because the propylene market is forecast to grow faster than the ethylene market. However, the specific advantages or preference for propane dehydrogenation are not discussed in the provided literature.

丙烯在化工行业的重要性多年来显著增长。它是许多重要石化产品的关键原料，包括聚丙烯、丙烯腈、环氧丙烷等。丙烯的需求一直在稳步增长，自1990年以来年均增长率为5.7%。到2000年，丙烯产量达到约5200万吨，预计到2010年将增长到8400万吨，主要由聚丙烯需求增长驱动。

然而，文献并未特别提到丙烷脱氢作为首选生产方法，也未讨论其经济和环境优势。相反，它提到目前全球丙烯产量的70%来自蒸汽裂解装置，28%来自炼油厂流化催化裂化（FCC）装置，只有2%来自特定的专用工艺，其中包括丙烷脱氢等。

文档表明，为满足未来需求，预计来自蒸汽裂解以外工艺的丙烯市场份额将显著增长。这是因为丙烯市场预计将比乙烯市场增长更快。然而，提供的文献中并未讨论丙烷脱氢的具体优势或偏好。
