[1] "Propylene is the key building block for the production of important petrochemicals, such as polypropylene, acrylonitrile, propylene oxide, cumene, phenol, isopropylic alcohol and many others"

[2] "As shown in Fig. 1, propylene worldwide demand has been increasing at an annual average of 5.7% since 1990; by year 2000, propylene production was about 52 million tonnes, and it is projected that by year 2010, demand will grow to 84 million tonnes, due to the increasing polypropylene demand"

[3] "Currently, about 70% of propylene worldwide production comes from steam crackers, 28% from refinery fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) units and 2% from specific on-purpose processes, such as propane dehydrogenation, metathesis and others."

Propylene's significance in the chemical industry has grown substantially over the years. It is a key building block for many important petrochemicals, including polypropylene, acrylonitrile, and propylene oxide. The demand for propylene has been increasing steadily, with an annual average growth rate of 5.7% since 1990. By 2000, propylene production was about 52 million tonnes, and it was projected to reach 84 million tonnes by 2010, primarily driven by the increasing demand for polypropylene.

However, the literature does not specifically discuss propane dehydrogenation as a preferred production method. In fact, it mentions that currently, only about 2% of worldwide propylene production comes from specific on-purpose processes, which include propane dehydrogenation. The majority of propylene (70%) is produced from steam crackers, followed by fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) units (28%).

The document does not provide information about the economic and environmental advantages of propane dehydrogenation. Instead, it focuses on other methods to increase propylene production, such as reprocessing light FCC naphtha and modifying existing FCC units.

The literature suggests that while on-purpose propylene production processes (including propane dehydrogenation) are expected to quadruple in capacity over the next five years, they will still only cover a small part of the growing propylene demand. This indicates that while propane dehydrogenation may be increasing in importance, it is not presented as the primary solution to meet the growing demand for propylene.

丙烯在化学工业中的重要性多年来已显著增长。它是许多重要石油化学品的关键构建模块，包括聚丙烯、丙烯腈和环氧丙烷。丙烯的需求一直在稳步增长，自1990年以来年平均增长率为5.7%。到2000年，丙烯产量约为5200万吨，预计到2010年将达到8400万吨，主要是由于聚丙烯需求的增加。

然而，文献并未特别讨论丙烷脱氢作为首选生产方法。事实上，它提到目前全球丙烯产量中只有约2%来自特定的定向工艺，其中包括丙烷脱氢。大部分丙烯（70%）是由蒸汽裂解装置生产的，其次是流化催化裂化（FCC）装置（28%）。

文件没有提供关于丙烷脱氢的经济和环境优势的信息。相反，它侧重于其他增加丙烯产量的方法，如重新处理轻质FCC石脑油和改造现有FCC装置。

文献表明，虽然定向丙烯生产工艺（包括丙烷脱氢）的产能预计在未来五年内将增加四倍，但它们仍将只能满足不断增长的丙烯需求的一小部分。这表明，虽然丙烷脱氢的重要性可能在增加，但它并未被呈现为满足不断增长的丙烯需求的主要解决方案。
