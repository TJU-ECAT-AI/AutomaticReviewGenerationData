[1] "Propylene is the key building block for the production of important petrochemicals, such as polypropylene, acrylonitrile, propylene oxide, cumene, phenol, isopropylic alcohol and many others"

[2] "As shown in Fig. 1, propylene worldwide demand has been increasing at an annual average of 5.7% since 1990; by year 2000, propylene production was about 52 million tonnes, and it is projected that by year 2010, demand will grow to 84 million tonnes, due to the increasing polypropylene demand"

Propylene's significance in the chemical industry has grown substantially over the years. It serves as a crucial building block for various important petrochemicals, including polypropylene, acrylonitrile, propylene oxide, cumene, phenol, and isopropyl alcohol. The demand for propylene has been steadily increasing, with an annual growth rate of 5.7% since 1990. By 2000, propylene production reached 52 million tonnes, and projections indicated a demand of 84 million tonnes by 2010, primarily driven by the increasing demand for polypropylene.

However, the literature does not specifically discuss propane dehydrogenation as a preferred production method or its economic and environmental advantages. Instead, it mentions that currently, 70% of worldwide propylene production comes from steam crackers, 28% from refinery fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) units, and only 2% from specific on-purpose processes, which include propane dehydrogenation among others.

The document suggests that to meet future demand, the market share of propylene from processes other than steam cracking is expected to grow significantly. This is because the propylene market is forecasted to grow faster than the ethylene market. However, the text does not provide specific information about the advantages or increasing adoption of propane dehydrogenation as a production method.

丙烯在化工行业的重要性多年来已显著增长。它是多种重要石化产品的关键原料，包括聚丙烯、丙烯腈、环氧丙烷、异丙苯、苯酚和异丙醇。丙烯的需求一直在稳步增长，自1990年以来年增长率为5.7%。到2000年，丙烯产量达到5200万吨，预计到2010年需求量将达到8400万吨，主要是由于聚丙烯需求的增加。

然而，文献并未具体讨论丙烷脱氢作为首选生产方法或其经济和环境优势。相反，它提到目前全球丙烯产量的70%来自蒸汽裂解装置，28%来自炼油厂流化催化裂化（FCC）装置，只有2%来自特定的定向工艺，其中包括丙烷脱氢等。

文档表明，为满足未来需求，预计来自蒸汽裂解以外工艺的丙烯市场份额将显著增长。这是因为预计丙烯市场的增长速度将快于乙烯市场。然而，文本并未提供关于丙烷脱氢作为生产方法的优势或其采用增加的具体信息。
