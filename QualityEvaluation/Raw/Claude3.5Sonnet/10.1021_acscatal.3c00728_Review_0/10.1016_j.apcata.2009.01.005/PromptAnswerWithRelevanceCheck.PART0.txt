The given scientific literature does not contain any information about propene's significance in the chemical industry, the increasing demand for propane dehydrogenation, or the economic and environmental advantages of this approach. The document focuses on chromium-loaded calcium-hydroxyapatite catalysts for propane oxidative dehydrogenation, but does not discuss broader industry trends or economic factors. To answer this question, additional sources would be needed that provide information on propene market dynamics and industrial production methods.
