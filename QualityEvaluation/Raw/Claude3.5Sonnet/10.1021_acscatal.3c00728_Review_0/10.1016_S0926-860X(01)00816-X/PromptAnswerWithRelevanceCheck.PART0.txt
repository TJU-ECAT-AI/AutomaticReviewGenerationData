<EnglishVersionAnswer>

The provided literature does not contain specific information about the evolution of propene's significance in the chemical industry, the increasing demand driving adoption of propane dehydrogenation, or the economic and environmental advantages of this approach. The document focuses primarily on technical aspects of various dehydrogenation processes for ethane and propane, but does not discuss market trends or comparative advantages of propane dehydrogenation specifically. To properly answer this question, additional sources with more market and industry-focused information would be needed.

The given literature does not contain information specifically addressing propene's evolving significance in the chemical industry, the increasing demand driving adoption of propane dehydrogenation, or the economic and environmental advantages of this approach. The document focuses primarily on catalytic dehydrogenation and oxydehydrogenation processes for producing olefins from paraffins, but does not provide details about propene demand or production trends. To answer this question, additional sources with more recent market and industry data would be needed.

The given scientific literature does not contain information specifically addressing propene's evolving significance in the chemical industry, the increasing demand driving adoption of propane dehydrogenation, or the economic and environmental advantages of this approach. The document focuses more on the technical aspects of various dehydrogenation processes for paraffins, including propane, but does not discuss market trends or comparative advantages in detail.

To fully answer this question would require additional information not present in the provided text. The literature does mention propane dehydrogenation as one of the processes discussed, but does not go into depth about its adoption drivers or advantages compared to other methods.

所提供的科学文献并未包含特别涉及丙烯在化工行业中不断发展的重要性、推动丙烷脱氢法采用的需求增长，或这种方法的经济和环境优势的信息。该文档更多地关注各种烷烃（包括丙烷）脱氢过程的技术方面，但并未详细讨论市场趋势或比较优势。

要全面回答这个问题需要额外的信息，而这些信息在所提供的文本中并不存在。文献确实提到了丙烷脱氢作为讨论的过程之一，但并未深入探讨其采用驱动因素或与其他方法相比的优势。
