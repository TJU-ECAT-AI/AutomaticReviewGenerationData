[1] "The gas-phase dehydrogenation of cyclohexane was carried out at 270 C and atmospheric pressure in a similar experimental setup."

[2] "It is generally assumed that the dehydrogenation of cyclohexane proceeds via the adsorption of cyclohexane on a metal site followed by sequential CH bond cleavage steps that lead to the formation of benzene and hydrogen atoms adsorbed on adjacent metal sites"

[3] "The close proximity between Pt and Fe in such sites leads to the reduction of Fe, which can thus become active for cyclohexane dehydrogenation."

The literature does not directly address the broader significance of selective dehydrogenation reactions or compare reactor and UHV studies. However, it does provide some relevant information on cyclohexane dehydrogenation over supported catalysts:

Selective dehydrogenation of cyclohexane is studied as a model reaction, often used to evaluate catalytic performance. The reaction is typically carried out in gas phase at elevated temperatures (e.g. 270°C) and atmospheric pressure in fixed-bed reactors. 

The mechanism is thought to involve adsorption of cyclohexane on metal sites, followed by sequential C-H bond cleavage to form benzene and adsorbed hydrogen. Key characterization techniques used include FTIR spectroscopy, hydrogen chemisorption, HRTEM, and EXAFS to probe the catalyst structure and metal-support interactions.

The study demonstrates how bimetallic catalysts like PtFe/SiO2 can enhance activity compared to monometallic Pt. The proximity of Pt and Fe is proposed to facilitate Fe reduction, creating new active sites. This illustrates how detailed characterization of bimetallic interactions can inform catalyst optimization.

While the paper focuses on a specific system, it exemplifies common approaches in studying dehydrogenation catalysts, including evaluation of metal particle size, oxidation state, and electronic effects on activity and selectivity. Combining reaction studies with advanced spectroscopic techniques provides insights into structure-activity relationships.

虽然文献没有直接讨论选择性脱氢反应的更广泛意义或比较反应器和超高真空研究,但它确实提供了一些关于负载型催化剂上环己烷脱氢的相关信息:

环己烷的选择性脱氢被研究作为一种模型反应,经常用于评估催化性能。该反应通常在固定床反应器中以气相形式在升高的温度(如270°C)和大气压下进行。

反应机理被认为涉及环己烷在金属位点上的吸附,随后是顺序C-H键断裂形成苯和吸附氢。使用的关键表征技术包括FTIR光谱、氢气化学吸附、HRTEM和EXAFS,以探测催化剂结构和金属-载体相互作用。

研究表明,像PtFe/SiO2这样的双金属催化剂可以提高活性,相比于单金属Pt。Pt和Fe的邻近被认为有助于Fe的还原,创造新的活性位点。这说明了详细表征双金属相互作用如何能为催化剂优化提供信息。

虽然该论文集中在一个特定系统上,但它例证了研究脱氢催化剂的常见方法,包括评估金属粒子大小、氧化态和电子效应对活性和选择性的影响。将反应研究与先进的光谱技术相结合,可以深入了解结构-活性关系。
