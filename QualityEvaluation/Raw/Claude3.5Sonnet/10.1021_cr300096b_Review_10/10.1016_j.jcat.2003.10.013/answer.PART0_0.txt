<EnglishVersionAnswer>

The given literature does not contain information directly relevant to answering the question about selective dehydrogenation reactions, their significance in various fields, or comparisons between reactor studies and UHV studies. The document focuses on in situ EXAFS studies of Pd and BiPd catalysts during liquid-phase oxidation of 1-phenylethanol, which is not closely related to the topics mentioned in the question. Therefore, this question cannot be adequately answered based solely on the provided literature.

给定的文献中没有直接相关的信息来回答关于选择性脱氢反应、它们在各个领域的重要性,或反应器研究与超高真空研究之间比较的问题。该文档主要集中于1-苯基乙醇液相氧化过程中Pd和BiPd催化剂的原位EXAFS研究,这与问题中提到的主题并不密切相关。因此,仅基于所提供的文献无法充分回答这个问题。
