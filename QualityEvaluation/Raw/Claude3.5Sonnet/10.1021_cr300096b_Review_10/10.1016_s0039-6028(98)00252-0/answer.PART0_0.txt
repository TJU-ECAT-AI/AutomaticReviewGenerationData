[1] "Hydrogenation of methylacetylene to form propylene is the most favored reaction pathway on all three surfaces accounting for ca 20% of the adsorbed monolayer."

[2] "The alloy surfaces also greatly increase the amount of reversibly adsorbed methylacetylene, from none on Pt(111) to 60% of the adsorbed layer on the (E3×E3)R30Sn/Pt(111) surface alloy."

[3] "Experiments were performed in a stainless steel UHV chamber equipped with instrumentation for Auger electron spectroscopy (AES), low energy electron diffraction (LEED) and Ar+ ion sputtering. A shielded UTI 100C quadrupole mass spectrometer (QMS) was used for TPD."

[4] "All TPD measurements were made using the QMS in line-of-sight with the sample surface and using a linear heating rate of 4 K s1."

[5] "Previous studies of ethylene, propylene [31] and acetylene [21] on Pt(111) and the PtSn alloys have determined the chemisorbed monolayer coverage of these molecules to be 0.25, 0.25 and 0.27 ML, respectively, independent of the concentration of Sn in the surface alloy."

This study provides insights into selective dehydrogenation reactions, particularly focusing on C-H bond dehydrogenation over supported catalysts. While it does not directly address N-H bond dehydrogenation, fuel synthesis, or hydrogen storage, it offers valuable information on reaction pathways and catalytic behavior relevant to these fields.

The research methods employed in this ultra-high vacuum (UHV) study include:

1. Temperature Programmed Desorption (TPD): This technique was used to investigate the adsorption, desorption, and reaction of methylacetylene on Pt(111) and Sn/Pt(111) surface alloys.

2. Auger Electron Spectroscopy (AES): Used to check surface cleanliness and composition.

3. Low Energy Electron Diffraction (LEED): Employed to verify surface structure and long-range order.

4. Mass Spectrometry: Utilized to analyze reaction products and monitor various mass fragments during TPD experiments.

The reaction conditions investigated included:
- Ultra-high vacuum environment
- Temperature range from 95 K to 1200 K
- Various surface compositions (Pt(111) and two Sn/Pt(111) alloys)
- Different methylacetylene exposures

Key findings that inform the optimization of catalytic processes include:

1. Alloy surfaces increased reversible adsorption of methylacetylene, suggesting potential for improved catalyst reusability.

2. Hydrogenation to propylene was the favored reaction pathway, indicating selectivity towards this valuable product.

3. Sn alloying suppressed complete decomposition to surface carbon, potentially extending catalyst lifetime.

4. Different product distributions were observed on various surfaces, demonstrating the ability to tune selectivity through alloy composition.

These UHV studies contribute to our understanding of fundamental surface reactions and catalyst behavior at the atomic level. While industrial conditions differ significantly, such studies provide crucial insights into reaction mechanisms, surface interactions, and the effects of catalyst composition. This knowledge can guide the design and optimization of practical catalytic systems for selective dehydrogenation reactions in chemical production and related fields.
