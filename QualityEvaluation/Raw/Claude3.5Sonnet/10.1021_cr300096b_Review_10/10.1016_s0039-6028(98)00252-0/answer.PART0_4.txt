[1] "Hydrogenation of methylacetylene to form propylene is the most favored reaction pathway on all three surfaces accounting for ca 20% of the adsorbed monolayer."

[2] "The alloy surfaces also greatly increase the amount of reversibly adsorbed methylacetylene, from none on Pt(111) to 60% of the adsorbed layer on the (E3×E3)R30Sn/Pt(111) surface alloy."

[3] "Experiments were performed in a stainless steel UHV chamber equipped with instrumentation for Auger electron spectroscopy (AES), low energy electron diffraction (LEED) and Ar+ ion sputtering. A shielded UTI 100C quadrupole mass spectrometer (QMS) was used for TPD."

[4] "All TPD measurements were made using the QMS in line-of-sight with the sample surface and using a linear heating rate of 4 K s1."

[5] "Previous studies of ethylene, propylene [31] and acetylene [21] on Pt(111) and the PtSn alloys have determined the chemisorbed monolayer coverage of these molecules to be 0.25, 0.25 and 0.27 ML, respectively, independent of the concentration of Sn in the surface alloy."

This study provides insights into selective dehydrogenation reactions, particularly focusing on C-H bond dehydrogenation over supported catalysts. The research methods and characterization techniques used include:

1. Ultra-High Vacuum (UHV) studies: The experiments were conducted in a UHV chamber, which allows for precise control of surface conditions and reactants.

2. Temperature Programmed Desorption (TPD): This technique was used to study the adsorption, desorption, and reaction of methylacetylene on various surfaces.

3. Auger Electron Spectroscopy (AES): Used for surface analysis and to check surface cleanliness.

4. Low Energy Electron Diffraction (LEED): Employed to verify surface structure and long-range order.

5. Mass Spectrometry: A quadrupole mass spectrometer was used to analyze desorption products during TPD.

The study investigated the reaction of methylacetylene on Pt(111) and PtSn alloy surfaces, focusing on hydrogenation and dehydrogenation pathways. Key findings include:

1. Hydrogenation of methylacetylene to propylene was the most favored reaction pathway on all surfaces, accounting for about 20% of the adsorbed monolayer.

2. The addition of Sn to the Pt surface increased the amount of reversibly adsorbed methylacetylene, demonstrating how alloying can modify surface reactivity.

3. The study determined monolayer coverages for various molecules on these surfaces, providing important information for understanding surface reactions.

These UHV studies contribute to our understanding of selective dehydrogenation processes by:

1. Allowing precise control and characterization of surface conditions and reactions.
2. Providing insights into the effects of surface composition on reactivity and selectivity.
3. Enabling the study of reaction mechanisms and pathways at a molecular level.

While UHV studies may not directly replicate industrial conditions, they provide fundamental insights that can inform the optimization of catalytic processes in chemical production, fuel synthesis, and hydrogen storage. The understanding gained from these studies can guide the design of more efficient and selective catalysts for various applications.
