[1] "Hydrogenation of methylacetylene to form propylene is the most favored reaction pathway on all three surfaces accounting for ca 20% of the adsorbed monolayer."

[2] "The alloy surfaces also greatly increase the amount of reversibly adsorbed methylacetylene, from none on Pt(111) to 60% of the adsorbed layer on the (E3×E3)R30Sn/Pt(111) surface alloy."

[3] "Experiments were performed in a stainless steel UHV chamber equipped with instrumentation for Auger electron spectroscopy (AES), low energy electron diffraction (LEED) and Ar+ ion sputtering. A shielded UTI 100C quadrupole mass spectrometer (QMS) was used for TPD."

[4] "All TPD measurements were made using the QMS in line-of-sight with the sample surface and using a linear heating rate of 4 K s1."

[5] "Increasing the concentration of Sn in the Pt(111) surface also changes the H2 desorption temperature from dehydrogenation during TPD."

This study provides insights into selective dehydrogenation reactions, particularly focusing on C-H bond dehydrogenation over supported catalysts. The research methods and characterization techniques used include:

1. Ultra-High Vacuum (UHV) studies: The experiments were conducted in a UHV chamber, allowing for precise control of reaction conditions and surface analysis.

2. Temperature Programmed Desorption (TPD): This technique was used to study the adsorption, desorption, and reaction of methylacetylene on various surfaces.

3. Auger Electron Spectroscopy (AES): Used for surface composition analysis.

4. Low Energy Electron Diffraction (LEED): Employed to study surface structure.

5. Mass Spectrometry: A quadrupole mass spectrometer was used to analyze desorption products.

The study investigated the reaction of methylacetylene on Pt(111) and Sn/Pt(111) surface alloys under UHV conditions. Key findings include:

1. Hydrogenation of methylacetylene to propylene was the most favored reaction pathway on all surfaces.

2. Alloying Sn with Pt increased the amount of reversibly adsorbed methylacetylene and changed the dehydrogenation behavior.

3. The concentration of Sn in the surface alloy affected the H2 desorption temperature, indicating changes in the C-H bond breaking process.

These UHV studies contribute to our understanding of selective dehydrogenation by providing detailed insights into surface reactions, adsorption behaviors, and the effects of alloying on catalytic properties. Such information is crucial for optimizing catalytic processes in chemical production and fuel synthesis.

However, it's important to note that UHV studies have limitations in directly representing industrial conditions. To fully optimize catalytic processes, these fundamental studies need to be complemented with studies under more realistic reaction conditions and on supported catalysts.

3. 俄歇电子能谱（AES）：用于表面成分分析。

4. 低能电子衍射（LEED）：用于研究表面结构。

5. 质谱：使用四极质谱仪分析脱附产物。

该研究在UHV条件下研究了甲基乙炔在Pt(111)和Sn/Pt(111)表面合金上的反应。主要发现包括：

1. 甲基乙炔氢化生成丙烯是所有表面上最有利的反应途径。

2. 将Sn与Pt合金化增加了可逆吸附的甲基乙炔量，并改变了脱氢行为。

3. 表面合金中Sn的浓度影响了H2的脱附温度，表明C-H键断裂过程发生了变化。

这些UHV研究通过提供表面反应、吸附行为以及合金化对催化性能影响的详细见解，有助于我们理解选择性脱氢。这些信息对于优化化学生产和燃料合成中的催化过程至关重要。

然而，需要注意的是，UHV研究在直接代表工业条件方面存在局限性。为了充分优化催化过程，这些基础研究需要与在更真实反应条件下和supported催化剂上进行的研究相互补充。
