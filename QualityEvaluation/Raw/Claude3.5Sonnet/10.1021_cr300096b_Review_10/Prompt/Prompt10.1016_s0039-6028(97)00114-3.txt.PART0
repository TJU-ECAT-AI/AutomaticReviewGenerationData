Chemisorption of ethylene, propylene and isobutylene on ordered Sn/Pt(111) surface alloys
Abstract
The adsorption and decomposition of a series of alkenes  ethylene, propylene and isobutylene  on Pt(111) and the (2×2) and
Sn/Pt(111) surface alloys was investigated with temperature programmed desorption (TPD), low energy electron diffraction (LEED) and sticking coefficient measurements. In the case of ethylene, this study extends a previous investigation [M.T. Paffett, S.C. Gebhard, R.G. Windham and B.E. Koel. Surf. Sci. 223 (1989) 449]. We report for the first time a
ordered structure for ethylene chemisorbed on the (2×2)Sn/Pt(111) surface alloy. In general for these small alkenes, sticking coefficient and TPD measurements show little or no effect of alloyed Sn on either the initial sticking coefficient or the saturation coverage of these molecules on the two Sn/Pt(111) ordered surface alloys when compared with the clean Pt(111) surface at 100 K. As was reported previously for ethylene, these PtSn surface alloys have weaker propylene and isobutylene chemisorption bonding and strongly suppressed decomposition. Considering propylene and isobutylene as methyl-substituted ethylene reveals a small trend toward decreasing adsorption energy and on all of these surfaces as the amount of methyl substitution increases. The propylene adsorption energy decreases from 17.4 to 14.8 and then to 11.7 kcal mol1 as the substrate is changed from Pt(111) to the (2×2) and the
alloys, as estimated by TPD peak temperatures. The isobutylene adsorption energy decreases from 17.1 to 14.7 and then to 10.8 kcal mol1 for the same series. This implicates that the Pt-only three-fold hollow sites are very important for strong alkene chemisorption, since removal of these sites on the
alloy causes a sharper decrease in the adsorption energy than expected based upon the changes observed for the (2×2) alloy. Even though propylene and isobutylene contain allylic CH bonds that are much weaker than the vinylic CH bonds in ethylene, only ca. 57% as much propylene and isobutylene decomposes on the (2×2) alloy compared to the Pt(111) surface and no decomposition occurs on the
alloy. This result shows the importance of adjacent Pt-only three-fold hollow sites in alkene decomposition.
1. Introduction
The chemisorption of alkenes on Pt(111) has been investigated rather extensively due to a fundamental interest in the chemistry of these molecules as reactants, products and intermediates in hydrocarbon conversion catalysis

. Commercial supported metal heterogeneous catalysts used for this catalysis, and in particular for hydrocarbon reforming, are bimetallic catalysts, but few fundamental studies have explored the chemisorption of alkenes on bimetallic surfaces. To better understand the fundamental properties and reactivity of PtSn bimetallic surfaces, we have studied the adsorption of a series of hydrocarbons on two ordered Sn/Pt(111) surface alloys. The initial investigation of these surfaces was made by Paffett and Windham
[6]
, and they proposed that surface alloys were formed by annealing to near 1000 K after depositing Sn on the Pt(111) surface. Their proposal was first confirmed by angular dependent low energy ion scattering spectroscopy (LEISS)
[7]
and later by low electron energy diffraction (LEED) IV
[8]
and X-ray photoelectron diffraction (XPD) analysis
[9]
. Previous work in our laboratory has led to reports on the surface chemistry of these Sn/Pt(111) surface alloys for chemisorption of CO, H2 and O2
[10]
, C2H4
[11]
, C2H2
[12]
, butane and isobutane
[13]
, several C4 alkenes
[14]
, and larger hydrocarbons like cyclohexane, benzene and cyclohexyl
[15]
, cyclohexene
[16]
, cyclohexadiene
[17]
and methylcyclohexane

.
The small (C2C5) linear alkenes are all di-σ-bonded to Pt(111) at 100230 K

,

,

. Alkylidyne species are the stable products of dehydrogenation of these hydrocarbons on Pt(111) at room temperature as explored by various techniques, for example, LEED IV analysis
[20]
, static secondary ion mass spectroscopy (SSIMS)
[21]
, near edge X-ray adsorption fine structure (NEXAFS)
[22]
, and infrared reflection-absorption spectroscopy (IRAS)
[23]
. Determining the coverage of ethylene chemisorbed on Pt(111) at 100 K and of ethylidyne in the (2×2) structure was the subject of some controversy. Estimates usually fell into two ranges [Ref.
[24]
and Refs therein], either 0.25 or 0.5 monolayers (ML). This issue has now been resolved by an absolute determination using nuclear isotope reactions
[25]
. Adsorption of C2H4 on Pt(111) at 100 K leads to a disordered C2H4 overlayer with 0.25 ML coverage. Heating the adlayer to 300 K results in desorption of 56% of the ethylene and leaves ethylidyne on the surface
[24]
. Adsorbing C2H4 at 300 K forms a saturation coverage of 0.25 ML ethylidyne in an ordered (2×2) structure. A direct observation of ethylene to ethylidyne conversion on Pt(111) using scanning tunneling microscopy (STM)
[26]
also gave results consistent with the coverage assignments of ethylene and ethylidyne. The coverages of the other molecularly adsorbed alkenes and the corresponding alkylidynes are not as certain, but slightly lower coverage structures should be formed in the molecularly chemisorbed monolayer due to the larger molecular sizes. However, it is possible that similar alkylidyne coverages could result at saturation.
This paper extends a previous study of the adsorption and desorption behavior of ethylene
[11]
on the (2×2)Sn/Pt(111) and the
Sn/Pt(111) surface alloys and also investigates for the first time the chemistry of propylene and isobutylene on these surfaces. These alkenes can be considered as methyl-substituted ethylenes: propylene replaces one H atom in ethylene with a methyl group, while isobutylene substitutes both H atoms on the same carbon in ethylene with two methyl groups. The chemistry of this series should be similar. The methyl group inductive effect should not appreciably affect the molecular chemisorption bond strength, that is, the PtC covalent σ bond strength in the adsorbed alkene. One might expect higher reactivity for both propylene and isobutylene compared to ethylene since these molecules have allylic CH bonds that are ca. 22 kcal mol1 weaker than the vinylic CH bonds in ethylene.
2. Experimental methods
These experiments were performed in an ultrahigh vacuum (UHV) chamber with a base pressure of 1×1010 Torr pumped by a 220 l s1 ion pump, a Ti sublimation pump and a 170 l s1 turbomolecular pump. This chamber was equipped with four-grid optics for LEED, a cylindrical mirror analyzer (CMA) for Auger electron spectroscopy (AES), an ion sputtering gun, and a UTI 100 C quadrupole mass spectrometer (QMS) for temperature programmed desorption (TPD). A stainless steel shield with an aperture of ca. 1 cm diameter covered the ionizer region of the QMS. In order to stop electron emission from the ionizer, two high transparency stainless steel screens were used  one across the end of the ionizer grid (with a bias of 55 V) and one across the entrance aperture of the shield (at ground potential)  between the ionizer region and the sample. For TPD measurements, the sample was positioned ca. 1 mm in front of the entrance aperture for the QMS. The heating rate was 4 K s1 in TPD.
The substrate was a Pt(111) single crystal (Atomergic, 5N purity) and was cleaned with the same procedure as before
[24]
. The substrate cleanliness was carefully checked by AES prior to each TPD experiment. The sample is in close contact to a liquid nitrogen-cooled Cu block and can be resistively heated. The temperature was measured by a chromelalumel thermocouple that was spot-welded directly to the side of the crystal.
The gases used were propylene (Matheson, 99%), ethylene (Matheson, 99.5%) and isobutylene (Aldrich, 99% purity). The gases were used as received without further purification, and appeared to be free from any large concentration of impurities as monitored by in situ mass spectrometry. Gas exposures given in this paper are in units of Langmuir (1 L=106 Torr·s1) after an approximate correction for the flux enhancement factor of our directed beam-doser and ion gauge sensitivity (a correction factor of ca. 30 was derived from forcing the initial slope of the uptake curves to reflect an initial sticking coefficient of unity, as measured by our beam reflection technique). All gas exposures were given with temperature of the sample at 100 K or below. Measurements of the sticking coefficient of ethylene and propylene were made in our laboratory as before
[27]
by using a direct beam reflection method adapted from King and Wells
[28]
. This method provides absolute determinations of sticking probabilities and also surface coverages. The coverages used throughout this paper are referenced to the Pt(111) surface atom density of 1.505×1015 atoms cm2, corresponding to Θ=1.0.
3. Results
3.1. Structure of the Sn/Pt(111) surface alloys
Following the work of Paffett and Windham
[6]
, the Sn/Pt surface alloys were prepared by evaporation of Sn onto a Pt(111) single crystal at 300 K and then annealing the crystal at 1000 K for 10 s. Depending upon the amount of Sn deposition initially, the structures that are formed after annealing have either a (2×2) or
LEED pattern. Both of these surfaces have been studied by angle-dependent LEISS measurement with Li+ at 5001000 eV, and it was found that Sn is incorporated into the Pt surface layer to form a surface alloy rather than forming adatoms, with the Sn almost coplanar with the Pt top layer atoms; Sn atoms protrude 0.02 nm above the surface Pt plane
[7]
. This structure determination has since been confirmed by LEED IV
[8]
and XPD
[9]
measurements. The top view of these two Sn/Pt surface alloys with a stoichiometry of Pt3Sn and Pt2Sn are shown in
Fig. 1
. For brevity, we refer to these two surface alloys as the (2×2) alloy and the
alloy in the rest of the paper.

Sn/Pt(111). Several small ensembles of contiguous Pt atom clusters are cross-hatched and identified by the number of Pt atoms in the ensemble.
These ordered alloys sharply constrain the Pt ensemble size (number of contiguous reactive Pt atoms) available for adsorption and reaction to rather small numbers and also allow fine control of the reactive sites available at the surface. For the (2×2) structure, three-fold Pt sites are present but no adjacent three-fold Pt sites are present. All three-fold sites comprised of only Pt are eliminated for the
structure and the distance between adjacent two-fold sites is increased. Sn site-blocking within the alloy layer may play a key role in the chemistry of these surface alloys since it has been shown by ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) that alloying causes only small changes in the Pt d-DOS and in particular the DOS near EF
[29]
.
3.2. Ethylene
Ethylene adsorption and desorption on the (2×2) and
PtSn surface alloys has been studied previously
[11]
. In
Fig. 2
, we report new TPD measurements following ethylene adsorption to saturate the chemisorbed monolayer on Pt(111) and the (2×2) and
PtSn surface alloys at 100 K.
Fig. 2
a compares C2H4 desorption on these surfaces. Although not shown here, we also observed that the C2H4 desorption temperature decreased as the coverage increased for each substrate in a manner consistent with that in the previous report
[11]
. In comparison with Ref.
[11]
, we have excellent agreement for the peak temperatures, but it appears that we have produced higher quality phases of the surface alloys since our TPD spectra are without the high temperature tails on both the (2×2) and
surface alloys. For example, the small higher temperature peak at ca. 240 K on the
alloy in Ref.
[11]
occurs at the same temperature as C2H4 desorption from the (2×2) alloy and we conclude that the presence of some of the (2×2) phase as an impurity can account for this feature. We have shown very clearly in our previous studies of the adsorption of isobutane on these surface alloys that multiple TPD peaks result from multiple phases at the surface

In
Fig. 3
a, we show H2 desorption after C2H4 chemisorption on these three surfaces. With better quality spectra than that reported before
[11]
, our H2 TPD spectra clearly reveal that no H2 desorption occurs up to 800 K and C2H4 decomposition is completely suppressed on the
surface alloy, but a small amount of decomposition occurs on the (2×2) alloy. The H2 desorption peak at 500 K from the (2×2) alloy suggests that similar surface fragments may be produced from ethylene decomposition on both the Pt(111) and (2×2) alloy surfaces, but confirmation of this will have to come from further study. The H2 desorption peaks below 300 K on the (2×2) and
surfaces are simply due to a cracking fraction from C2H4 in the QMS ionizer. The small ethane desorption yield that occurs in TPD on Pt(111) was absent on the alloys, and no desorption products other than C2H4 and H2 were observed on these two alloy surfaces.

surfaces. (b) Surface stoichiometry of hydrocarbon fragments resulting from C2H4 dehydrogenation as a function of temperature on Pt(111).
On clean Pt(111), the H2 desorption profile showing distinctive peaks arises from the sequential dehydrogenation of ethylene to form ethylidyne and then at higher temperatures forming CnHy species
[1]
. We show in
Fig. 3
b a quantitative analysis of the amount of H2 desorption that occurs for these reactions. The ordinate in
Fig. 3
b is the H2 TPD area as a function of temperature, obtained by the integration of the H2 TPD spectrum from Pt(111), after normalization of the mass spectrometer intensity to correct for the influence of the surface temperature on the H2 sensitivity
1
. As expected on Pt(111), the H2 desorption peak at 302 K is clearly due to the removal of one H atom per ethylene molecule to produce ethylidyne near 365 K. Ethylidyne decomposition produces a rapid loss of surface hydrogen in a peak at 500 K to produce surface species with a stoichiometry of C2H. Further dehydrogenation probably occurs via condensation of these species, producing surface species with a stoichiometry of C3H at 600 K.
The amount of H2 desorption in
Fig. 3
a from ethylene decomposition on the (2×2) alloy is 5.4% of the H2 desorption yield from ethylene decomposition on Pt(111). Using the same saturation coverage for C2H4 chemisorption on Pt(111) and the (2×2) surface alloy, vida infra, we calculate that this corresponds to the decomposition of 2.4% of the chemisorbed ethylene.
The ethylene saturation coverage of 0.25 ML on Pt(111) at 100 K has now been determined unambiguously by nuclear reaction analysis
[25]
. It is of interest to determine the ethylene saturation coverage on the two alloy surfaces. This can be done by using our TPD data. The C2H4 TPD peak area from Pt(111) following C2H4 saturation coverage (0.25 ML) at 100 K is 0.135 ML (54% of 0.25 ML; 2% desorbs as ethane)
[24]
. By normalizing to this value, the C2H4 TPD peak areas from the (2×2) and
surfaces correspond to the desorption of 0.26 and 0.27 ML C2H4. Since the amount of H2 desorption was also calibrated, that is, the H2 area from Pt(111) is due to 44% decomposition of the C2H4 monolayer at 100 K
[24]
, the ethylene saturation coverage on the (2×2) and
surface was calculated as the sum of the reversibly and irreversibly adsorbed contributions to be 0.26 and 0.27 ML, respectively, at 100 K.
New measurements of the ethylene adsorption kinetics on Pt(111) and the two surface alloys were also made in order to determine the influence of alloyed Sn on the sticking coefficient and saturation coverage of ethylene on these surfaces. Overall, these sticking coefficient curves appeared very similar to those that we have reported previously for cyclohexene on these surfaces
[16]
, except that we observed a stronger precursor influence (constant sticking coefficient) for C2H4 adsorption on Pt(111) at 100 K compared to cyclohexene adsorption on Pt(111) at 180 K. Two regions of these curves are of particular interest:
1.
the value of initial sticking coefficient at zero C2H4 coverage, SO; and
2.
the value of the ethylene saturation coverage, Θsat, when S approaches zero.
Two conclusions can be made from this data. First, SO for C2H4 on all of these substrates at 100 K had a value of 1.00.1. Thus, the value of SO is not affected by the presence of Sn in the surface layer, even though Sn atoms are most likely not involved in bonding of di-σ-bonded ethylene to the surface. This is consistent with the important influence of a precursor state present at the Sn sites that we have previously discussed as the modifier precursor state
[30]
. We also note that SO for C2H4 adsorption on all of these substrates at 150 K was slightly lower (0.1) than that at 100 K. Secondly, the sticking coefficient curves indicate relative saturation coverages on the three surfaces at 100 K of 0.25, 0.23 and 0.20 ML C2H4 on Pt(111), (2×2) and
PtSn surface alloys, respectively, reasonably consistent with the more accurate TPD results above. Thus, the C2H4 monolayer coverage is not affected by the presence of Sn in the surface layer of these PtSn alloys.
Ethylidyne, C2H3(a), species produced after exposing ethylene on Pt(111) at room temperature form an ordered (2×2) structure
[2]
. However, no LEED pattern has ever been reported for ethylene molecularly adsorbed on Pt(111). [Steininger et al.
[31]
did report a (2×2) LEED pattern for C2H4 on Pt(111) <200 K, but this was most likely due to electron induced dissociation of the adlayer
2
,

.] We report here the first observation of an ordered adlayer structure for di-σ-bonded ethylene
[11]
molecules on the (2×2)Sn/Pt(111) surface alloy. A saturation coverage of C2H4 on the (2×2) alloy at 100 K only caused an enhancement in the background intensity [in addition to the pre-existing (2×2) pattern]. However, after annealing this surface with an ethylene monolayer to 185 K, a sharp
LEED pattern was observed, as redrawn schematically in
Fig. 4
.

Fig. 4. Schematic drawing of the
LEED pattern that is produced by annealing a monolayer of C2H4 on the (2×2) alloy to 185 K.
No ordered structures were observed for C2H4 adsorbed on the
surface alloy under any conditions. Even though ethylene has a similar monolayer coverage on both the (2×2) and
surface alloys, ethylene only produced an ordered structure on the (2×2) alloy. An obvious difference in the structure of the (2×2) and
surface alloys is that there are no three-fold Pt-only hollow sites on the
surface alloy, as shown in
Fig. 1
. Perhaps one reason for the lack of an ordered structure on the
surface alloy is the lack of three-fold hollow sites. Later, we will show a couple of the possible adsorption structures using this information and the ethylene coverage.
3.3. Propylene
The results of measurements of propylene adsorption kinetics on the three surfaces using the beam reflection method can be summarized as follows. We observed no difference between the values of SO on the three surfaces at 100150 K within experimental error; SO=1.00.05 independent of the Sn concentration. With the Pt(111) sample at 150 K to avoid any physisorbed species, the propylene monolayer coverage can be obtained by integration of the uptake curve and normalization of the propylene beam flux
[28]
with that for ethylene to match the known saturation coverage of C2H4 under these conditions. The saturation coverage of propylene on Pt(111) at 150 K is ca. 0.20 ML by this procedure. One might expect that di-σ-bonded propylene would adsorb at the same sites as those for di-σ-bonded ethylene, giving rise to a similar saturation coverage, unless steric repulsion between the adsorbates due to the larger size of propylene inhibit it. The maximum coverage of propylene in a closest-packed adsorbed layer, neglecting considerations of adsorption sites, is ca. 0.27 ML and this represents an upper limit to the coverage in the chemisorbed propylene layer. For our purposes in the rest of this paper, we will assume that the propylene monolayer coverage is 0.25 ML.
The C3H6 coverages from adsorption kinetics measurements on the two alloys were strongly dependent on temperature over the range 100150 K due to the population of weakly bound states (vide infra) on the alloys, and thus it is difficult to reliably report the influence of the Sn concentration on the propylene monolayer coverage. However, all evidence is that propylene chemisorption occurs without any substantial decrease in coverage due to site-blocking by alloyed Sn.
Fig. 5
summarizes the adsorption kinetics obtained from TPD measurements. We have two goals in constructing such plots. First, we need to evaluate the amount of adsorbed propylene that decomposes during TPD, that is, is irreversibly adsorbed, and secondly, to determine the saturation coverage of the propylene monolayer. We use the H2 TPD area from ethylene decomposition to give a calibration for the hydrogen coverage. This calibrates the irreversibly adsorbed propylene coverage by simply using stoichiometry. We know from the sticking coefficient measurements described above, and our previous work on the condensation of a number of small hydrocarbons
[27]
, that S=1 on Pt(111) at 100 K, and thus the slope of the irreversible chemisorption curve determines the propylene exposure scale (under conditions that no other desorption products are observed). Furthermore, S=1 independent of coverage on Pt(111) at 100 K and so the C3H6 TPD area can be calibrated to propylene coverage by forcing the slope of the reversibly chemisorbed propylene curve to be the same as that for the irreversibly adsorbed curve under conditions that the H2 TPD yield is constant. The coverage of propylene in the chemisorbed monolayer (0.20 ML) is given by the sum of the two curves, and the amount of reversibly and irreversibly adsorbed propylene as a function of coverage are simply given by the amounts of C3H6 and H2 desorption, respectively. For the propylene monolayer, 0.13 ML desorbs molecularly and 0.07 ML decomposes during TPD.

Fig. 6
a shows propylene TPD spectra after two different C3H6 exposures on Pt(111) at 100 K. This low exposure produces a submonolayer propylene coverage while the high exposure forms both strongly and weakly bound propylene states. We associate the peak at 120 K with population of physisorbed states in the second layer. These results are consistent with previous spectra

,

. By taking the TPD peak at 284 K obtained at low exposure, we can estimate a desorption activation energy of 17.4 kcal mol1 by Redhead analysis
[32]
with the assumption of first-order desorption kinetics and a pre-exponential factor of 1013 s1. At saturation coverage, the monolayer peak broadens and shifts down to 272 K, indicating a decrease in an activation energy of ca. 1 kcal mol1 (most likely two desorption states comprise this peak). This behavior is similar to that of other alkenes on Pt(111)
14
,
15

16
and this decrease in the adsorption energy is usually interpreted as due to adsorbateadsorbate repulsive interactions.

Fig. 6
b shows propylene TPD spectra after propylene exposures on the (2×2) alloy at 100 K. The highest temperature desorption peak occurs at a lower temperature than on Pt(111), shifting from 246 to 232 K with increasing coverages up to a saturation monolayer coverage. These peak temperatures correspond to desorption activation energies of 14.813.8 kcal mol1. Following saturation of the high temperature state, desorption of physisorbed propylene occurs in a peak near 124 K, the same as on Pt(111). There is an additional small peak at ca. 180 K that occurs at high coverages that could be due to desorption from a small concentration of the
alloy phase. Propylene TPD spectra obtained after propylene was exposed on the
surface alloy is given in
Fig. 6
c. At the lowest coverage shown, the chemisorbed peak occurs at 196 K, corresponding to an activation energy of 11.7 kcal mol1. At monolayer and higher coverages, this peak broadens to lower temperatures with a peak maximum at 180 K (10.8 kcal mol1). Desorption of physisorbed propylene occurs in a peak at 124 K as on the other substrates studied.
A comparison of the molecular propylene TPD spectra from all three surfaces is made in
Fig. 7
. An exposure of 1.4 L propylene was used which saturates the chemisorbed monolayer and also forms some additional physisorbed species. The desorption temperature of the chemisorbed state shifts down as the Sn surface concentration goes up. The same tendency has been observed for all of the other hydrocarbons that we have studied on these two Sn/Pt surface alloys. A key feature, which is shown clearly in
Fig. 7
is that the amount of molecular propylene desorption from the (2×2) and
alloys is much more than that from the Pt(111) surface for the same propylene coverage. In other words, the PtSn alloys have a much higher selectivity for reversible propylene adsorption. We will now show that this occurs concomitantly with a dramatic decrease in H2 desorption due to the suppression of propylene decomposition.

The bottom TPD spectrum in
Fig. 8
a shows H2 desorption resulting from dehydrogenation of the propylene monolayer on Pt(111). The exposure used was large enough to saturate the chemisorbed monolayer and form physisorbed propylene. This H2 TPD spectrum shows several sharp peaks at temperatures <450 K (296, 330 and 432 K) and a broad peak at 624 K which extends to 780 K. This result agrees well with previous data

. All of the H2 desorption peaks >400 K are clearly reaction-rate limited, where H2 desorption occurs immediately upon CH bond scission. Assuming that this process follows first-order kinetics, and also assuming that the lower temperature H2 evolution is also reaction-rate limited (due to the destabilization of the PtH bond owing to the coadsorbed hydrocarbons) allows us to use Redhead analysis to roughly estimate the activation energies of 18.0, 19.8, 25.9 and 37.5 kcal mol1, respectively, for the barriers to the dehydrogenation reaction steps on the surface. These assumptions appear justified by the SSIMS data of Ogle et al.
[5]
which they use to determine 17.52 and 22.52 kcal mol1 for propylidyne formation and decomposition, respectively, on Pt(111).

An overall picture of the dehydrogenation mechanism of propylene on Pt(111) is available from Avery and Sheppard
[4]
. At low temperatures, the high-resolution electron energy loss spectroscopy (HREELS) spectra indicate that C3H6 rehybridizes and forms a di-σ-bonded C3H6 species. At room temperature, Avery's TPD spectra show that one H is lost per complex and a propylidyne species is formed. At temperatures of 450 K or higher, the decomposition fragments on the surface were assigned to CH(a) and C2H(a) species by HREELS and TPD. Integration of our H2 TPD spectra after a propylene exposure to produce a monolayer on Pt(111) at 100 K indicate that the H2 peaks in
Fig. 8
a, after normalizing the data as described for ethylene, have relative ratios of 1:3:2 for the three regions divided by 360 and 485 K, as shown in
Fig. 8
b. Thus, heating to 360 K produces C3H5, propylidyne, and further heating to 485 K produces species with an overall surface stoichiometry of C3H2.
Alloyed Sn sharply suppresses the H2 yield in TPD. The TPD spectra for H2 evolution from the (2×2) and
alloys after similar large C3H6 exposures as that on Pt(111) are also shown in
Fig. 8
a. The amount of H2 evolution from the (2×2) alloy is only 7% of the H2 yield from Pt(111), and no desorption of H2 occurs from the
alloy (and thus no propylene decomposition occurs) even though the coverage of chemisorbed propylene is nearly the same as on Pt(111). Using the normalized C3H6 and H2 TPD areas on Pt(111) and the (2×2) surface alloy, we calculate that this corresponds to the decomposition of 4% of the chemisorbed propylene.
Fig. 9
shows the H2 TPD spectra following several coverages of propylene on the (2×2) surface alloy. The main peak occurs at 440 K, very close to the temperature of the main H2 peak on Pt(111) due to propylidyne decomposition, and we propose that propylidyne formation may occur on this surface too. In these spectra, the peaks near 230 K arise from molecular propylene desorption and cracking in the QMS ionizer. The H2 evolution from initial dehydrogenation of propylene (possibly to form propylidyne) appears as a shoulder near 370 K. This is very similar to the H2 desorption feature resulting from ethylene dehydrogenation on the (2×2) alloy. However, since H2 desorption from atomic H dosed to the (2×2) alloy surface occurs at 337371 K
10
,
33
, it is not clear whether or not this H2 evolution is desorption rate limited or reaction rate limited. The first step in the propylidyne decomposition mechanism on the (2×2) alloy and the corresponding activation energy appears to be quite similar to that on Pt(111) since the H2 evolution has a similar peak temperature and profile. The main differences occur in the higher temperature region where relatively larger peaks at 530 and 680 K are present along with the absence of the peak at 624 K compared to that on Pt(111), indicating a different propylidyne decomposition mechanism. AES spectra taken of the surface alloys after TPD were consistent with these H2 TPD results and no carbon was detected.

Fig. 9. H2 desorption resulting from C3H6 decomposition on the (2×2) surfaces. The exposures were 0.0, 0.30, 0.90 and 1.4 L C3H6.
No desorption products other than H2 and propylene were found on any of these surfaces. During TPD, signals at 2, 15, 16, 27, 28, 39, 40, 41, 42 and 78 amu were monitored. From our results for propylene uptake on Pt(111), where the H2 and C3H6 TPD areas were converted to coverages, we can now determine the coverage of the strongly adsorbed propylene on both alloy surfaces to be the same and equal to 0.30 ML. This value can be compared to the density of 0.27 ML expected if the monolayer exhibited closest-packing.
We looked carefully using LEED after sequential annealing from 100 to 800 K on both the (2×2) and
alloys following the adsorption of a multilayer coverage of propylene on the surface at 100 K. The (2×2) or
LEED patterns were always present, and no extra spots in addition to those from the substrate were observed due to propylene. This indicates that no long range ordered structures were formed from propylene on these two surface alloys.
3.4. Isobutylene
The adsorption of isobutylene on Pt(111) at 95 K is described by the uptake curves shown in
Fig. 10
. These curves were generated from the TPD spectra shown below and using a similar calibration procedure as described above for propylene. The coverage in the isobutylene monolayer is 0.115 ML. During TPD of the chemisorbed monolayer, 0.05 ML desorbs molecularly as isobutylene and 0.065 ML decomposes to liberate hydrogen from the surface.

Isobutylene TPD spectra for increasing isobutylene exposures on Pt(111) at 95 K are shown in
Fig. 11
a. At small exposures, isobutylene is irreversibly adsorbed and no molecular desorption occurs. Chemisorbed C4H8 desorbs at 280 K, which is quite close to that for low coverages of both ethylene (296 K) and propylene (284 K) on Pt(111). This similar desorption temperature indicates that all three alkenes form the same type of di-σ-bonding to Pt(111) at 95 K. Repulsive interactions between adsorbates leads to a decrease in the desorption temperature to 268 K for a monolayer coverage of isobutylene. This corresponds to a desorption energy of 17.116.3 kcal mol1 for the chemisorbed state. Physisorbed species formed from higher isobutylene exposures desorb near 126 K. These results are in good agreement with a previous spectrum from Avery and Sheppard

Isobutylene TPD spectra are shown in
Fig. 11
b after isobutylene exposures on the (2×2) surface alloy at 95 K. Even at low exposure, the monolayer peak appears at 240 K due to some reversible adsorption. Higher isobutylene exposures shift this peak to a lower temperature, and it occurs at 212 K for the saturation chemisorbed layer. These peaks indicate desorption activation energies of 14.712.7 kcal mol1 from the monolayer. Desorption from a weakly bonded state was found at 140 K. This peak was not observed for ethylene or propylene desorption from any of the substrates studied, but was observed for all of the other butene isomers
[14]
. A high temperature shoulder on the multilayer peak on Pt(111) in
Fig. 11
a also exists, modifying the peak shape from the typical zero order desorption profile for sublimation (which has a very sharp decrease on the high temperature edge), and at lower coverages desorption occurs near 145 K. Obviously, it is difficult to assign the origin of this peak, for example, it could be due to a species in the chemisorbed monolayer that was π-bonded to the surface or species in the second layer (first physisorbed layer). The assignment of this peak is aided by a quantitative analysis of the isobutylene uptake curve constructed from the TPD areas (not shown here). The TPD peaks at 212 and 140 K have the same areas and so each of the states giving rise to these peaks have the same coverage. We do not believe that this peak arises from the chemisorbed monolayer because this assignment would force the monolayer coverage of 1-butene, which has a similar peak, to far exceed the 1-butene density allowed by closest-packing. We also do not believe that this peak arises from the second layer because the coverage associated with this peak should then be ca. 0.23 ML, the closest-packed two-dimensional density, and this is never achieved (however, clustering could decrease the amount desorbing in this feature). We favor an assignment of this peak to species that are not part of the chemisorbed layer, that is, not forming site-specific and geometry-specific bonding interactions with the surface, but that do have a fair energetic distinction from the formation of the multilayer state on this surface due to some appreciable interaction with the surface. We envision that this interaction occurs via (nonoptimal) coordination of additional isobutylene molecules to the surface in the rather large amount of open space existing in the chemisorbed monolayer, which has a coverage much less than the closest-packed density of 0.23 ML. We note that exposing large doses of isobutylene on the (2×2) alloy at 105 K will not form the multilayer desorption peak at 126 K, but fully populates the peak at 140 K.
A series of isobutylene TPD spectra for increasing exposures on the
alloy at 95 K are presented in
Fig. 11
c. At low isobutylene coverage, reversible adsorption gives rise to a peak at 180 K. It shifts to 170 K as the coverage reaches saturation of the monolayer, corresponding to desorption energies of 10.810.2 kcal mol1. The desorption profile broadens significantly to lower temperatures near completion of the monolayer due to desorption of physisorbed species of similar origin to those that give rise to the 140 K peak on the (2×2) alloy. A multilayer desorption peak is seen at 122 K, the same as that from the surface of Pt(111) and the (2×2) alloy.
Fig. 12
shows a comparison of the molecular isobutylene TPD spectra from all three surfaces. An exposure of 0.94 L isobutylene was used which saturates the chemisorbed monolayer and also forms some additional physisorbed species. Consistent with our results on ethylene and propylene, the desorption temperature of the strongly chemisorbed isobutylene state shifts down as the Sn surface concentration goes up. The PtSn alloys have a much higher selectivity for reversible isobutylene adsorption and the amount of molecular isobutylene desorption from the (2×2) and
alloys is much more than that from the Pt(111) surface for the same coverage.

b shows, utilizing the corrected data from the bottom curve of
Fig. 13
a, the C4Hx stoichiometry for the species formed from dehydrogenation of an isobutylene monolayer on Pt(111) as a function of substrate temperature. H2 evolution can be used to account for the overall stoichiometry since H2 is the only product we detected in TPD in addition to isobutylene. The H2 desorption ratios for isobutylene are 1.2:2.0:2.0:1.3:1.5 corresponding to the peaks at 330, 400, 480, 535 and 628 K in
Fig. 13
a. Thus, the following reactions are indicated:
The overall relationships of the stoichiometry and H2 desorption temperatures are in good agreement with the results reported earlier by Avery and Sheppard
[4]
. They determined that di-σ-bonded isobutylene was the surface species at 170 K, and our results are consistent with the first step in dehydrogenation being the formation of isobutylidyne (C4H7). However, our TPD results indicate slightly different C4Hx species from Avery and Sheppard's
[4]
result at higher temperatures (>400 K). For example, at 420 K, we find C4H5 instead of C4H4.5 in Ref.
[4]
.
H2 TPD spectra from the (2×2) and
alloys after C4H8 exposures sufficient to saturate the monolayer are also shown in
Fig. 13
a. About 5% of the H2 yield from Pt(111) is observed for the H2 evolution from the (2×2) alloy, corresponding to the decomposition of 3% of the chemisorbed isobutylene. No desorption of H2 occurs from the
alloy. Alloyed Sn sharply suppresses the H2 yield in TPD from both alloys, even though the coverage of chemisorbed isobutylene is nearly the same as on Pt(111). AES spectra taken of the surface alloys after TPD were consistent with these H2 TPD results and no carbon was detected.
The monolayer coverage of strongly adsorbed isobutylene on the (2×2) and
alloys can be determined to be 0.11 and 0.14 ML, respectively, using our results for isobutylene uptake on Pt(111). This value is much lower than the density of 0.23 ML expected if the monolayer exhibited closest-packing.
No extra spots in LEED were observed following isobutylene adsorption on both the (2×2) and
surface alloy at 95 K, indicating that no ordered structures of the adsorbate were formed. A number of annealing experiments to various temperatures up to 800 K were carried out following multilayer adsorption with no new spots observed.
4. Discussion
4.1. Influence of alloyed Sn on alkene adsorption and dehydrogenation
The kinetics of adsorption of ethylene, propylene and isobutylene on the two PtSn alloys are essentially unmodified from those on the Pt(111) surface at 100 K. The hydrocarbon sticking coefficient results were obtained from both direct, reflected-beam kinetics measurements and the uptake curves constructed by integration of the TPD spectra, and both results were consistent. This is quite amazing behavior given that the surface contains either 25 or 33% Sn atoms and Sn is considered to be inert for chemisorption of alkenes. The origin for the enhanced sticking coefficient of these alkenes on the alloy surface containing Sn site-blockers is the important role played by a modifier precursor state in adsorption on bimetallic surfaces
[30]
.
The small influence of Sn on the coverage of ethylene, propylene and isobutylene in the chemisorbed monolayer is due to only a small adsorption ensemble requirement for chemisorption of these molecules on Pt. It is clear that at most two to three Pt atoms are sufficient to form the di-σ-bonded adsorbates. This result lowers our previous estimate of four Pt atoms as the ethylene adsorption ensemble requirement, resulting from Bi adatom site-blocking experiments
[34]
. Bi site-blocking experiments such as those in Ref.
[34]
determined as a lower limit the van der Waals size of the molecular rather than the adsorption ensemble requirement since the Bi adatoms compete for space within the adlayer
[35]
. In fact, TPD uptake curves show the same or higher rather than lower monolayer coverages of propylene and isobutylene chemisorbed on the two surface alloys compared to Pt(111) even in the presence of substantial amounts of surface Sn. Separate sticking coefficient measurements for propylene using beam reflection indicated lower saturation coverages on the alloys than on Pt(111), but these are not as accurate as the TPD uptake results in these case due to the desorption of some fraction of the monolayer that occurs on the alloys at 150 K, which we were forced to use to completely stop formation of the condensed multilayer phase.
Table 1
summarizes all of the coverage values determined in our work, including the saturation monolayer coverage (Θsat), fraction of reversibly (Rev) and irreversibly (Irr) chemisorbed alkenes on these three surfaces, and the saturation monolayer coverage calculated from a closest-packing model (Θcp). The coverage Θcp is the upper limit for the number of molecules in the chemisorbed monolayer. The value we found for Θsat on Pt(111) is consistent with the alkene molecular size, with the larger molecule having a lower monolayer coverage (0.25, 0.17 and 0.115 ML for ethylene, propylene and isobutylene, respectively), but in all cases is significantly smaller than Θcp. This is because Θcp is calculated ignoring the importance of specific sites and bonding geometries that are obviously required to form the strongly chemisorbed di-σ-bonded alkenes. This effect is strongest for isobutylene since it has the largest size (di-methyl substituted ethylene) and so self site-blocking plays a more important role. The result that the chemisorption capacity of the two surface alloys is not reduced compared to Pt(111) shows that the adsorption ensemble requirement for chemisorption of these alkenes on Pt(111) and the two Sn/Pt(111) alloys is at most two to three Pt atoms. Higher alkene chemisorption coverages on the (2×2) and
alloy than on Pt(111) are probably due to a small relaxation of the bonding geometry/site requirements that results from slightly weaker bonding interactions between the alkenes and these surfaces.

bThis value determined from the AES measurement of the irreversibly adsorbed fraction.
The extent of irreversible adsorption, that is, the fraction of the chemisorbed monolayer that dehydrogenates to liberate H2 and leave carbon on the surface after TPD, reported in
Table 1
can be calculated in two ways. First, as discussed in the
Section 3
using C2H4 as a reference, we have used TPD uptake curves to determine these fractions for propylene and isobutylene as 35 and 56%, respectively. The uncertainty for propylene arises from too few data points in the uptake curve in that case. Secondly, the decomposition amount can be obtained from the AES C(272)/Pt(237 eV) peak-to-peak height ratio measured after TPD experiments (up to 800 K). Calibration can be obtained from C/Pt=0.22 corresponding to ΘC=0.22 ML due to 44% decomposition of 0.25 ML C2H4 on Pt(111). Assuming a linear relationship of the C/Pt AES ratio and ΘC over this small range gives an independent determination of the irreversibly adsorbed fraction of isobutylene of 54%, in good agreement with the value of 56% from TPD uptakes. For propylene, if we assume that the saturation monolayer coverage of propylene is the same for Pt(111) and
alloy, as is the case for ethylene and isobutylene, then AES indicates 56% of the chemisorbed layer decomposes on Pt(111).
The above analysis shows that the fraction of the monolayer that undergoes decomposition for C2H4, C3H6 and i-C4H8 on Pt(111) is 44, 56 and 56%, respectively. These molecules are all di-σ-bonded on Pt(111)

, and all dehydrogenate to form alkylidyne species at elevated temperatures, but differ from each other in principle in their reactivity. The activation energy required for dehydrogenation of a molecule should decrease with decreasing CH bond strength in the molecule. In the gas phase, the CH bond dissociation energy, D300(CH), for the vinylic hydrogen in ethylene is 111.2 kcal mol1, while D300(CH)=88.8 kcal mol1 for the allylic hydrogen in propylene
[40]
. Thus, one might expect that propylene with one methyl group providing allylic hydrogens and isobutylene with two methyl groups providing allylic hydrogens would have lower activation energies for dehydrogenation than would ethylene. However, there are no large differences in the activation energies required to form the respective alkylidynes on Pt(111), since TPD and ELS studies show very similar conversion temperature (<280 K) for alkenes from di-σ-bonded to another stable surface species. A careful sum frequency generation (SFG) measurement
[38]
monitored the conversion of di-σ-bonded ethylene to ethylidyne on Pt(111) starting ca. 255 K. This result can be explained by recalling that in the di-σ-bonded adsorbates the C atoms are all sp3-hydridized and thus the CH bonds evidently have quite similar strengths, and therefore similar activation energies for bond dissociation. To the extent that the initial state and/or transition state for CH bond breaking retains some sp2 character, one should observe an increased reactivity in the order ethylene, propylene, isobutylene, as expected from the gas phase energetics, due to the ease of dissociation of the β-CH (allylic) bonds compared to the α-CH (vinylic) bonds. On Pt(111), this trend does exist with >10% additional decomposition of propylene and isobutylene over that for ethylene.
We show for comparison in
Fig. 14
a the H2 TPD spectra from ethylene, propylene and isobutylene monolayers on Pt(111). As mentioned above, C2H4, C3H6 and i-C4H8 form alkylidynes on the Pt(111) surface at similar temperatures (260300 K) and H2 desorption starts at ca. 280 K in each case. However, the stability of the alkylidyne species formed decreases as the molecular weight increases. Ethylidyne decomposition peaks at 500 K, while propylidyne and isobutylidyne decompose to yield H2 peaks at 432 and 400 K, respectively. The H2 TPD spectra for ethylene, propylene and isobutylene monolayers on the two surface alloys are not compared in detail here, but are shown in
Fig. 3
,
Fig. 8
,
Fig. 12
. These H2 TPD spectra have a principal peak at the same temperature as the corresponding alkylidyne decomposition peak on Pt(111), indicating that alkylidyne species may be formed on the (2×2) alloy and possess similar thermal stabilities. While it is tempting to assign the small H2 evolution on the (2×2) alloy to defective Pt(111)-like regions, and we cannot rule out a small concentration of such defects, it is quite likely that these results reflect appropriately the alkene chemistry of the nondefective alloy. We make this conclusion because low coverages of alkylidynes on Pt(111) thermally decompose to give quite different H2 TPD spectra and also because we have observed in related work nearly 7% decomposition of cis-2-butene on the same (2×2) alloy, and this exceeds by far the defect concentrations typical of these surfaces.

15
,

discusses some aspects of the origin of the reduced reactivity of these surfaces and we will not repeat that here. However, several important points can be made. One would expect a low reactivity for the
alloy surface since it does not contain three-fold Pt sites. These sites are required to adsorb the ethylidyne product of ethylene dehydrogenation on Pt(111). Koestner et al.
[2]
used LEED IV analysis to show the ethylidyne occupies the fcc-threefold site on Pt(111). The (2×2) alloy has three-fold Pt sites, but still only a small amount of ethylene decomposition takes place on this surface alloy. As we discussed before
[11]
, perhaps the ensemble of Pt atoms required to stabilize the transition state or the reaction products [H(a)+CCH3(a)] must include two adjacent three-fold Pt sites. These do not exist on the (2×2) surface alloy. Another factor which is difficult to account for without additional careful kinetic measurements has to do with the fact that alkene desorption and CH bond breaking can be competitive reactions at high coverages. The observed decrease in alkene adsorption energy or a possible small increase in the CH dissociation barrier due to weak electronic effects at the alloy surfaces could possibly be sufficient to change the branching ratios of the reaction and lead to a reduction in the amount of dehydrogenation during TPD.
Fig. 15
shows how the molecular desorption peak temperature of chemisorbed ethylene, propylene and isobutylene changes as a function of surface Sn concentration in the surface alloys. In addition, the right-hand axis in
Fig. 15
gives the corresponding desorption activation energy as estimated by Redhead analysis. Increasing the Sn concentration decreases the desorption temperature, but in a nonlinear fashion. The largest effect is observed at a Sn concentration >25%. Also, very similar curves are found for these three alkenes. We are now piecing together a picture in which the influence of the surface Sn concentration on adsorption energies depends upon the degree of unsaturation of the adsorbed hydrocarbon. For alkanes, a weak nearly linear change with Sn concentration is observed. For alkenes (olefins), such as those studied here and which contain a CC double-bond in the gas phase but are strongly rehybridized on Pt(111) to have essentially a CC single bond, that is, to form a di-σ-bonded species, the changes are much stronger upon changing from the (2×2) to the
alloy than from Pt(111) to the (2×2) alloy, even though the change in Sn concentration is not as large. Now the bonding mode and geometry of all of these alkenes on the PtSn alloys is not known, however, we showed some time ago that C2H4 is di-σ-bonded on both alloy surfaces
[11]
, and we anticipate that these alkenes are similarly bonded on the alloy surfaces. The effect of Sn in the (2×2) alloy on the alkenes is similar to the effect on the alkanes  about a 40 K drop in the desorption temperature from Pt(111) to the (2×2) alloy. Thus, we attribute this to a weak electronic effect having to do with the polarizability of the surface. A much sharper change occurs when the Sn concentration is increased to form the
alloy. The chief difference in changing from the (2×2) to the
alloy is the elimination of three-fold Pt sites. We attribute the large effect of this change on the desorption temperature of the alkenes to the elimination of specific adsorption sites. Since there exists no determination to date of the surface crystallography of adsorbed alkenes on Pt(111), we cannot evaluate at this time the exact role played by the three-fold Pt sites.

4.2. Proposed adlayer structures for C2H4 adsorption on (2×2) Sn/Pt(111) alloy
The discovery of an ordered chemisorbed ethylene overlayer structure on the (2×2) Sn/Pt(111) alloy is one of the most important results from this work. Ethylene chemisorbed on Pt(111) does not form an adlayer with long range order, and so LEED IV analysis has not been applicable to determine the bonding site and molecular geometry on this important surface. We know from our previous HREELS studies
[11]
that ethylene is also di-σ-bonded on the (2×2) alloy, and so new information on the ethylene structure on the alloy which should be forthcoming may also directly relate to Pt(111) surfaces.
Some preliminary considerations for the adlayer structure are available from space-filling models of adsorbed ethylene. The molecular geometry for di-σ-bonded C2H4 on the (2×2) PtSn alloy has the molecular plane of ethylene parallel to the surface, as shown in the side view of adsorbed C2H4 drawn schematically at the top of
Fig. 16
a. We used the CC bond length of di-σ-bonded ethylene (dCC=1.49 Å
41
,
42
), the CH bond length (dCH=1.10 Å) of C2H4 in the gas phase, and tilted the two CH2 planes up out of the molecular plane (ΘCCH and ΘHCH=109) to account for sp3 rehybridization. Addition of the van der Waals radii to this framework (rH=1.2 Å and rC=1.46 Å) produces the space-filling models shown in the top views of adsorbed C2H4 at the middle and bottom of
Fig. 16

LEED pattern. In (b), all ethylene molecules occupy the same sites directly above Pt atoms. In (c), all ethylene molecules occupy the same sites directly above pure Pt three-fold hollow sites. In (d), two-thirds of the ethylene molecules sit above atop sites, and one-third sit above pure Pt two-fold bridge sites. All of the proposed structures have an ethylene coverage of 0.25 ML. The
unit cell is also shown in each of the drawings.
Three possible adsorption structures (of many) derived from the
LEED pattern that are consistent with the known coverage (0.25 ML) are presented in
Fig. 16
bd. Since C2H4 does not chemisorb on Sn surfaces, we considered only models where ethylene molecules solely bond to the Pt atoms in the alloy surface. In addition, the ordered C2H4 structure was found only on the (2×2) alloy and not on the
alloy. Since the main difference between these two alloys is that the
alloy does not contain any pure Pt three-fold hollow sites, the ordered adsorption structure on the (2×2) alloy may be due to the existence of these three-fold sites. The adlayer structure on the (2×2) alloy may be due to the existence of these three-fold sites. The adlayer structures shown in

, this structure would also be accounted for nicely since the center of all of the C2H4 molecules lie directly above a Pt atom. This highly symmetric distribution of adsorbed C2H4 has the long axis of the molecular skeleton parallel to the long axis of various 5-Pt atom clusters. The second structure illustrated in
Fig. 16
c contains C2H4 molecules that all lie directly above Pt three-fold hollow sites. Here, the di-σ bonds point to different Pt sites, one toward a Pt atop site and one toward a three-fold hollow site that contains two Pt atoms and one Sn atom. As in
Fig. 16
b, this structure has all the ethylene molecules equivalently bonded to the surface. The third structure illustrated in
Fig. 16
d, but also contains C2H4 molecules in which both of the di-σ bonds point to pure Pt three-fold hollow sites, as in
Fig. 16
b, but also contains C2H4 molecules in which both of the di-σ-bonds point at atop sites. These molecules lie directly above a Pt two-fold bridge site. One-third of the ethylene molecules (those centered on bridge sites) line up along a pure Pt row and the rest of the ethylenes sit on the center of 5-Pt atom clusters with an orientation of 60 away from the other molecules. The structure in
Fig. 16
b only involves one kind of adsorption site and has an appealing symmetry and so we favor that structure.
A determination of which, if either, of these three structures is correct will have to await a LEED IV study. We conclude by pointing out that the formation of specific, ordered alloy surfaces may give us a general tool for imposing order in molecular adlayers on reactive surfaces, thereby allowing us to bring to bear powerful probes of surface structure such as LEED that cannot be used on the unalloyed surface. This suggestion is related to previous applications by Somorjai and coworkers of the use of coadsorbates to induce ordering in molecularly adsorbed layers
[45]
. In those cases, the authors point out the importance of donoracceptor interactions in the formation of ordered structures. The formation of ordered alloy surfaces induces order by preparation of highly restrictive templates for chemisorption in the organization of reactive sites.
5. Conclusion
Alloying Sn with Pt(111) to form the (2×2) and
surface alloys has no measurable effect on the initial sticking coefficient of ethylene, propylene and isobutylene compared to clean Pt(111) at low temperatures and no significant effect on the saturation coverage of these molecules in the chemisorbed monolayer on these surfaces. Alloying Pt with Sn weakens the chemisorption bonding of all three of these molecules, with a relatively stronger effect produced on the
alloy. For the three alkenes studied, the desorption temperature on the (2×2) alloy (Sn=25%) is ca. 40 K lower than that on Pt(111) while an extra 4560 K lowering occurs on the
alloy (Sn=33%), even though only an additional 8% Sn was added in the top layer. We interpret that this change arises from the elimination of the pure Pt three-fold hollow sites and thus infer the importance of these sites in bonding alkenes on Pt(111). The similarity in the desorption temperatures (280296 K) for ethylene, propylene and isobutylene on Pt(111) shows that the chemisorption bond strength (via di-σ-bonding) is essentially the same for all three of these molecules; there is no substantial inductive effect on the PtC covalent bond strength due to methyl substitution of ethylene. The most dramatic effect of alloying Sn into Pt is the large reduction in the amount of dehydrogenation that occurs during TPD of alkenes from the PtSn alloys. In all cases, including in the presence of relatively weak allylic CH bonds, only ca. 4% of the chemisorbed monolayer of ethylene, propylene and isobutylene decomposes on the (2×2) alloy and no decomposition occurs on the
alloy. Elimination of adjacent Pt-only three-fold hollow sites on the (2×2) alloy suppresses >90% of the amount of decomposition on Pt(111), implicating adjacent Pt three-fold hollow sites as a key ensemble requirement for alkene decomposition. We also report in this paper for the first time the formation of an ordered structure of di-σ-bonded ethylene molecules on the (2×2) alloy: a
-CH4 ordered structure with an ethylene coverage of 0.25 ML.
