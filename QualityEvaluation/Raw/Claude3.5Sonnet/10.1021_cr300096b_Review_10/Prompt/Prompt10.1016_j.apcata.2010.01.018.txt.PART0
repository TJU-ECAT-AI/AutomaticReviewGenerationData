Inhibition of coking and CO poisoning of Pt catalysts by the formation of Au/Pt bimetallic surfaces
Abstract
The surface of Pt catalysts can be deactivated or poisoned during catalytic and electrocatalytic processes because of its strong bonding to hydrocarbon intermediates and carbon monoxide (CO). In the current work we have evaluated whether the formation of an Au/Pt bimetallic surface alloy would improve the resistance to coking and CO poisoning, using a combination of density functional theory (DFT) modeling and temperature-programmed desorption (TPD) experiments. The DFT results indicated that the binding energies of adsorbates, such as atomic hydrogen and oxygen, were much weaker on Au/Pt surfaces in comparison to Pt. The CO desorption TPD revealed that the Au/Pt surface bonded CO more weakly than Pt, indicating that modifying Pt with Au could potentially help reduce CO poisoning. In addition, the decomposition and dehydrogenation of cyclohexene were used as probe reactions to compare the extent of carbon deposition on the Pt and AuPt surfaces. TPD results showed that the presence of Au on Pt promoted the selective dehydrogenation of cyclohexene to benzene. In addition, Auger electron spectroscopy (AES) measurements revealed that the Au/Pt bimetallic surfaces inhibited carbon deposition on the surface, suggesting that the Au/Pt bimetallic alloy could be potentially resistant to coking.
Graphical abstract
Results from DFT modeling indicate that the formation of AuPt surface alloy reduces the biding energy of adsorbates, which should lead to a reduction in the extent of coke formation and CO poisoning on Pt. The reduction of coke formation is verified experimentally based on the decomposition of cyclohexene; the weakening of CO adsorption is confirmed based on the desorption temperatures of CO from Pt and AuPt surfaces.

1. Introduction
Pt is one of the most commonly used catalysts and electrocatalysts in a wide range of applications. However, monometallic Pt is susceptible to deactivation or poisoning during catalytic and electrocatalytic processes. For example, Pt catalysts can be deactivated due to carbon deposition or coking in many heterogeneous catalytic reactions. They can also be poisoned by carbon monoxide adsorption due to the strong bonding of CO on the Pt surface. The main objective of the current paper is to improve the resistance to deactivation by modifying the Pt surfaces with the presence of submonolayer to monolayer coverages of Au.
Bimetallic catalysts often show enhanced catalytic selectivity, activity and stability as compared to those of the parent metals. For instance, Au is inert and considered as a poor catalyst when present in the bulk state. In contrast, Au/Pt bimetallic catalysts have been found highly active in a number of reactions

. Previous study found that Au could electronically modify the Pt sites
[9]
and Au/Pt nanoparticles could not only suppress the adsorption of CO but also modify the strength of the surface adsorption
[10]
. Although many studies have been reported for the supported Au/Pt catalysts, fundamental surface science studies of the modification effects of Au on Pt are not well understood at present.

. In this paper we investigated Au/Pt bimetallic surfaces produced by depositing Au on a polycrystalline Pt substrate, using a combination of density functional theory (DFT) modeling and temperature programmed desorption (TPD) experiments. In particular, we performed comparative studies to determine how the presence of Au affected the binding energies of atomic hydrogen and CO; we also investigated the extent of carbon deposition from the decomposition of cyclohexene to determine the effect of bimetallic formation towards the potential resistance to coking.
2. Experimental and DFT methods
2.1. Preparation of bimetallic surfaces
The experiments were carried out in a two-level stainless steel ultra-high vacuum (UHV) chamber with a base pressure of 1 × 1010 Torr, as described previously
[23]
. The UHV system was equipped with a single-pass cylindrical mirror analyzer for Auger electron spectroscopy (AES) characterization and a quadrupole mass spectrometer (QMS) for temperature-programmed desorption (TPD) experiments and in situ verification of the purity of dosed molecules. A polycrystalline Pt foil (Alfa Aesar, 99.997%) was spot welded to two Ta posts which served as electrical contacts for resistive heating as well as thermal contacts for liquid nitrogen cooling. The temperature could be controlled between 100 K and 1200 K and was monitored by spot welding a K-type thermocouple to the back of the polycrystalline Pt foil and connecting this signal to a feed back controller.
The polycrystalline Pt foil was cleaned using several Ne+ sputtering cycles at 300 K followed by heating in vacuum to 1050 K, as described previously
[24]
. The surface was then exposed to oxygen (1 × 108 Torr for 100 s) at 890 K and annealed at 1050 K for 5 min. This process was repeated several times until it was confirmed by AES that the levels of surface impurities, such as C, S and O were negligible.
The Au/Pt bimetallic surfaces were prepared by depositing Au onto the polycrystalline Pt surface at 300 K. The Au source was made by wrapping a 0.1 mm diameter wire of Au metal (Alfa Aesar, 99.95%) around a 0.5 mm diameter W wire (Alfa Aesar, 99.95%). The deposition was performed through resistive heating of the W wire to evaporate the Au. An accelerating voltage of 5 kV was used in all AES measurements to determine the coverages of Au. Based on the calibration procedures to be discussed later, 1 ML Au on Pt corresponded to a peak-to-peak ratio of Au (2022 eV)/Pt (1969 eV) around 0.17.
2.2. TPD experiments
After synthesizing the surfaces of interest, hydrogen (Matheson, 99.999%), carbon monoxide (CO) (Matheson, 99.999%), and cyclohexene (c-C6H10) (Aldrich, 99+ %) were dosed with the surface temperature at or below 145 K. Cyclohexene was purified with successive freezepumpthaw cycles before use while hydrogen and CO were used without additional purification. Exposures used were 10 L for hydrogen and 5 L for both carbon monoxide and cyclohexene. These exposures were high enough to achieve a monolayer coverage on the Pt foil. The TPD spectra were taken from 105 K to 800 K with a linear heating rate of 3 K/s.
2.3. DFT modeling
The ab initio calculations were implemented using the Vienna ab-initio simulation package (VASP) version 4.6
[25]
,
[26]
,
[27]
. Ultrasoft Vanderbilt pseudopotentials (US-PP)
[28]
,
[29]
were used to represent the core electrons. The exchange-correlation energy was approximated using the PW91 functional
[30]
within the generalized gradient approximation (GGA)
[31]
with a basis set of plane waves up to an energy cutoff of 396 eV. The Pt (1 1 1) and Au (1 1 1) surfaces were modeled using a periodic 2 × 2 unit cell slab with four layers of metal and six equivalent layers of vacuum separating each slab. The surface Au/Pt/Pt (1 1 1) configuration was modeled by substituting the entire first layer of Pt (1 1 1) with Au while the remaining three layers were composed of Pt. To model the subsurface Pt/Au/Pt (1 1 1) configuration, Au replaced the second layer of the Pt (1 1 1) slab, while the first, third, and fourth layers remained composed of Pt. The intermixed configurations, labeled PtxAu1xPt where x is the percent of surface Pt, were modeled by switching either 1, 2, or 3 Au/Pt atom pairs in the top two layers. To simulate 0.5 ML H or O adatoms, two of the four three-fold hollow sites for the (1 1 1) plane were occupied by adatoms. The binding energies were calculated with the top two layers being allowed to relax to the lowest energy configuration while the third and fourth layers were frozen at the bulk PtPt distance of 2.83 Å or AuAu distance of 2.95 Å, as previously determined for the PW91 exchange/correlation functional
[32]
. A 3 × 3 × 1 Monkhorst-Pack k-point mesh
[33]
was used which resulted in 5 irreducible k-points in the first Brillouin zone.
3. Results and discussions
3.1. Characterization of Au/Pt surfaces
The AES peak-to-peak heights of Au (2022 eV) and Pt (1969 eV), along with the Au/Pt AES ratio, are monitored during Au deposition on Pt foil, as shown in
Fig. 1
a. For single crystal surfaces, layer-by-layer growth is characterized by distinct breaks in the AES features of both the overlayer and substrate as a function of deposition time
[18]
. In the current study, other than a sharp reduction in the Pt feature upon the initial deposition, there are no distinct breaks in either the Au (2022 eV) or Pt (1969 eV) intensity in
Fig. 1
a. The absence of the breaks can be due to either the polycrystalline nature of the Pt substrate or a growth mechanism that is not layer-by-layer.

Fig. 1. AES measurements following the deposition of Au on the Pt foil at 300 K as a function of deposition time.
In order to further understand the growth mechanism, the Au coverage on the Pt surface is correlated to the AES peak ratio of the Au (2022 eV) to Pt (1969 eV) features. Based on a 5 keV accelerating voltage, the Au coverage can be determined using the following equation
[34]
:
where I is the AES intensity, s is the sensitivity factor, d is the average thickness of the Au overlayer, θ is the emission angle, and
is the electron inelastic mean free path (IMFP) of electrons in Au. The calculated average thickness of Au, calculated from the corresponding AES Au/Pt ratio, is displayed as a function of deposition time in
Fig. 1
b. The nearly linear correlation between the average thickness of Au and deposition time suggests that growth of Au on Pt follows a layer-by-layer mechanism without significant cluster formation. The calibration curve in
Fig. 1
b indicates that 1 ML Au coverage corresponds to the IAu/IPt ratio of 0.17, which requires a deposition time of approximately 150 s.
The thermal behavior of 1.3 ML Au on Pt foil is shown in
Fig. 2
. Au was deposited onto Pt surface at 300 K. The surface was then heated at 3 K/s to increasingly higher temperatures. The AES scans were recorded after the surface was cooled below 500 K. It is clear that the Au/Pt ratio remains unchanged in the temperature range of 300800 K. At higher temperatures, the Au/Pt ratio decreases steadily, but levels off at a Au/Pt Auger ratio of 0.05 as the temperature approaches 1100 K. This suggests that Au remains on the surface of Pt, with the decrease in AES ratio arising from the agglomeration of the Au ML. This observation is different from the thermal behavior of 3d metals, such as Fe, Co and Ni, on Pt
[35]
, where the AES signals of the 3d metal overlayer reached zero at 1100 K due to their diffusion into the bulk Pt at high temperatures.

Fig. 2. AES measurements of thermal stability of an Au/Pt surface with an initial Au coverage of 1.3 ML.
The thermodynamic stability of the monolayer Au/Pt surface has been investigated by Christoffersen et al. based on DFT calculations of the segregation energy for the Au/Pt bimetallic systems
[36]
. Their calculations revealed a negative segregation energy for Au/Pt, suggesting that Au atoms prefer to stay on the surface of Pt. Such prediction is consistent with our AES measurement following the thermal annealing of Au on Pt (
Fig. 2
).
3.2. Effect of bimetallic formation on the binding strength of atomic H and O
As described in many previous theoretical and experimental studies, bimetallic surfaces with weak binding energies of hydrogen and oxygen also bond more weakly to other adsorbates, including CO and hydrocarbon molecules
[18]
.
Fig. 3
compares the calculated binding energies of atomic H and O on several bimetallic configurations at 1 ML Au coverage, including subsurface Pt/Au/Pt with Au residing between the first and third Pt layers, surface Au/Pt/Pt with Au on top of Pt, and several intermixed surfaces (PtxAu1x) with Au residing in the top two surface layers. The binding energy of atomic H follows the trend of Pt  Pt/Au/Pt > PtxAu1x > Au/Pt/Pt; the binding of atomic O follows a similar trend of Pt > Pt/Au/Pt > PtxAu1x > Au/Pt/Pt. Overall, results from the DFT calculations predict that the binding energies on Pt would decrease as the coverage of Au increases.

The DFT results in
Fig. 3
are consistent with the previous DFT predictions by Christoffersen et al.
[36]
regarding the binding energy of atomic hydrogen on the Au/Pt bimetallic surface with one monolayer of Au residing on a Pt substrate. These authors predicted that the binding of atomic hydrogen would be weaker on Au/Pt than on Pt due the electronic interaction between Au and Pt. Using a similar argument, these authors also predicted that the binding energy of molecular CO and other adsorbates should be weaker on Au/Pt than on Pt. The weaker interaction between the adsorbates and the Au/Pt surface should lead to a reduction for both the degree of CO poisoning by weakening the bonding strength of CO and the extent of coke formation by reducing the adsorption energies of hydrocarbons and their reaction intermediates, as demonstrated below.
3.3. Effect of bimetallic formation on binding of molecular CO
Fig. 4
shows the TPD results following the adsorption of CO on the Pt and Au/Pt surfaces. 5 L exposure of CO was used to achieve a saturation coverage on the Pt foil. Two CO desorption peaks are observed on the Pt surface at 415 K and 518 K. Since it was reported that CO desorbed at 400 K from Pt (1 1 1) and at 525 K
[37]
from Pt (1 0 0), it is most likely that the two desorption peaks are from Pt (1 1 1) and Pt (1 0 0) facets of the polycrystalline Pt foil. In comparison, on 0.5 ML Au/Pt surface, the CO desorption peaks shift to significantly lower temperatures, to 174 K and 237 K, respectively. Because the CO adsorption is an unactivated process, the desorption temperature of molecularly adsorbed CO can be correlated to the binding energy of CO by using the Redhead equation
[38]
. Assuming a first-order desorption process with a pre-exponential factor of 1 × 1013 s1, the binding energies of the two different desorption peaks of CO on Au/Pt surface can be estimated as 10.5 kcal/mol and 14.4 kcal/mol, which are much weaker than those of Pt surfaces (25.8 kcal/mol and 32.4 kcal/mol). In addition to the two low temperature peaks, another desorption peak is also observed on the 0.5 ML Au/Pt at 470 K, which is likely from the uncovered portion of the Pt foil. This desorption peak is nearly absent on the 1 ML Au/Pt, consistent with the AES results that the growth of Au on Pt occurs through the layer-by-layer mechanism.

Fig. 4. CO TPD results on Pt and Au/Pt surfaces. The changes in the Au/Pt AES ratios before and after annealing: from 0.167 to 0.133 in vacuum; from 0.182 to 0.129 in H2; from 0.185 to 0.118 in O2 and from 0.164 to 0.142 in CO.
As shown in
Fig. 4
, in order to further understand the thermal stability of the 1 ML Au/Pt surface, it was annealed to 950 K in vacuum and in the presence of H2, O2 and CO. A fresh ML Au/Pt surface was prepared for each annealing experiment. The AES ratios of Au/Pt before and after annealing are listed in the figure caption for each surface. The AES Au/Pt ratios did not decrease as significantly as that shown previously in
Fig. 2
. There are two possible reasons to account for such difference. First, in the thermal stability experiment, the Au/Pt surface was annealed by several heating and cooling cycles before reaching 950 K, whereas in
Fig. 4
the surfaces were annealed along to 950 K in one single step. Second, in the annealing experiment in
Fig. 2
the initial Au coverage was 1.3 ML instead of 1.0 ML, which should lead to a larger percentage decrease in the Au/Pt ratio. The annealed surfaces were characterized by the CO TPD measurement of CO (5 L exposure), as compared in
Fig. 4
. The characteristic desorption temperatures from Au/Pt, at 174 K and 237 K, are the main desorption features on the annealed surfaces, consistent with the AES ratios that the Au/Pt surfaces remain relatively stable even after annealing to 950 K in H2, O2 and CO.
In summary, the lower CO desorption temperatures on Au/Pt surfaces indicate a weaker binding energy of CO on the Au/Pt bimetallic surface, as predicted based on the extrapolation from the DFT calculations of H and O binding energies. In addition, the CO desorption peaks remain the same regardless of the annealing environment, indicating that the surface composition and morphology of the 1 ML Au/Pt bimetallic surfaces are stable in the potentially deactivated environment. The weaker binding of CO on Au/Pt, with desorption temperatures below room temperature, illustrates the possibility of using Au/Pt bimetallic alloy to reduce CO poisoning both as catalysts for the reforming of oxygenates and as electrocatalysts for the anodic oxidation of hydrogen and alcohols in low temperature fuel cells. By comparing the TPD spectra of the unannealed and annealed 1 ML Au/Pt surfaces, there is only a slight increase in the temperature range expected for the desorption from bare Pt (between 400 K and 550 K) on the annealed surfaces, suggesting that surface Au atoms do not undergo significant agglomeration at the conditions in
Fig. 4
.
3.4. Effect of bimetallic formation on carbon deposition from cyclohexene
Fig. 5
shows the TPD results after 5 L cyclohexene was dosed on the Au/Pt surfaces with and without pre-dosed H2. Pre-dosed H2 was used to mimic the hydrogenation condition. Cyclohexene is used as a probe molecule to study the coking of Pt and Au/Pt because cyclic hydrocarbons are important reaction intermediates in many refinery and petrochemical processes, in addition to serving as building blocks for many chemicals produced in the chemical industry. Cyclohexene has several competitive reaction pathways, including decomposition, dehydrogenation, disproportionation (self-hydrogenation), and hydrogenation.

Fig. 5. TPD experiments following the reaction of cyclohexene on Pt and Au/Pt surfaces, both with and without pre-adsorbed hydrogen.
As compared in
Fig. 5
, cyclohexene (C6H10, 82 amu) desorbs as a sharp feature at 147 K (physisorbed multiplayer) from Pt and Au/Pt surfaces and as a broad peak at 218 K (monolayer) from the Au/Pt surfaces.
Fig. 5
also compares the gas-phase products from three reaction pathways in the cyclohexene reaction: dehydrogenation to produce benzene and H2, hydrogenation or disproportionation to produce cyclohexane, and total decomposition to produce H2 (and surface atomic carbon). These reactions can be described in the following equations:
Dehydrogenation:
(1)
C6H10  C6H6 + 2H2
Self-hydrogenation:
(2)
C6H10 + H2  C6H12
Total decomposition:
(3)
C6H10  6C(ads) + 5H2
For benzene (C6H6, 78 amu) production on clean Pt, two desorption peaks are observed at 298 K and 375 K. The two peaks could be from the reaction of cyclohexene from the Pt (1 1 1) and Pt (1 0 0) facets in the polycrystalline foil. On the 0.5 ML Au/Pt surfaces, an intense and relatively sharp benzene desorption peak appears at 324 K. For the 1 ML Au/Pt surfaces, a broad desorption peak is observed with a center temperature at 330 K. For cyclohexane (C6H12, 84 amu) production, a desorption peak is observed on clean Pt at 261 K. Cyclohexane appears as a weak and broad peak at 300 K from 0.5 ML Au/Pt surfaces and is nearly absent from the 1 ML Au/Pt surfaces. The pre-adsorbed hydrogen does not significantly affect the reactivity of Au/Pt surfaces, though it contributes to a slightly higher yield of cyclohexane on Pt. Due to the polycrystalline nature of the Pt foil, it is difficult to quantify the absolute activity as previously performed on the Pt (1 1 1) single crystal surfaces
[35]
. Instead, a relative yield is provided in
Table 1
by defining the yield of benzene (C6H6, 78 amu) of clean Pt foil without co-adsorbed H2 as 1.0. The yield of cyclohexane (C6H12, 84 amu) is determined by comparing the peak areas of cyclohexane and benzene, after normalization using the sensitive factors of mass spectrometer for the two molecules, as described previously

The extent of total decomposition to produce atomic carbon, which is the initial process for coking of the Pt surfaces, is evaluated by the post-TPD AES, as shown in
Fig. 6
. An intense carbon peak (275 eV) is detected on the Pt foil, indicating that total decomposition to atomic carbon and hydrogen is a main reaction pathway on the Pt surface. In contrast, the absence of the carbon peak on the 1 ML Au/Pt surface implies that no decomposition reaction occurs on the Au/Pt bimetallic surfaces, indicating that the bimetallic surface should be much more resistant to coking. The extent of carbon deposition can be estimated from the AES C/Pt ratio using the quantification method reported elsewhere

Fig. 6. AES measurements of carbon deposition after cyclohexene TPD experiments on Pt and Au/Pt surfaces.
As summarized in
Table 1
, cyclohexene undergoes three reaction pathways on Pt surface, in which the total decomposition is the main pathway. Different from Pt, the reaction of cyclohexene on Au/Pt bimetallic surfaces, in particular the 0.5 ML Au/Pt surface, is mainly dehydrogenation; the extent of carbon deposition on 0.5 ML AuPt is also significantly reduced. No atomic carbon is detected after the TPD experiments on the 1 ML Au/Pt surfaces. Overall, the results in
Table 1
indicate that the activity of Pt toward cyclohexene is reduced by the formation of the Au/Pt bimetallic surface, consistent with a weaker binding energy of cyclohexene based on extrapolation from the DFT calculations of H and O binding energies.
4. Conclusions
Based on the results and discussion presented above, the following conclusions can be drawn regarding the effect of Au/Pt alloy formation on the surface reactivities of Pt:
(1)
DFT calculations predict that the binding energies of atomic H and O on Pt are significantly reduced upon the formation of the Au/Pt bimetallic surfaces. Based on existing correlations between the binding energies of atomic H and O with other molecular adsorbates
[18]
, DFT results suggest that the binding energies of CO and cyclohexene should also be reduced on the Au/Pt bimetallic surfaces.
(2)
TPD results reveal that CO binds more weakly to Au/Pt bimetallic surfaces than to the Pt surface, suggesting that the formation of Au/Pt bimetallic surface can reduce the extent of CO poisoning. In addition, the Au/Pt bimetallic surface is stable, as judged by the nearly identical CO TPD spectra after annealing ML Au/Pt surfaces in H2, O2, and CO.
(3)
The formation of Au/Pt bimetallic alloy helps reduce the coking problem by inhibiting the accumulation of atomic carbon from the reaction with cyclohexene. This suggests that the modification of surface Pt with Au should offer an opportunity to reduce the extent of coking of Pt during the reactions with hydrocarbon molecules.
