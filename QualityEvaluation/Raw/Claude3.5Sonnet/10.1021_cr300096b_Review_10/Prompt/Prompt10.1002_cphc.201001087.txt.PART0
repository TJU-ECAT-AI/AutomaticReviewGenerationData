Segregation and Stability in Surface Alloys:
PdxRu1x/Ru(0001) and PtxRu1x/Ru(0001)
Andreas Bergbreiter, Harry E. Hoster, and R. Jrgen Behm*[a]
1. Introduction
Surface alloys, with a single two-dimensional (2D) alloy layer
on a monometallic substrate, have attracted increasing interest
as model systems for bimetallic surfaces due to their well-de-
fined structure.[1,2] Vertically, the surface layer rests on a homo-
geneous substrate, at least in the ideal case of negligible bulk
diffusion, while the lateral distribution of the surface compo-
nents is accessible by high-resolution scanning tunneling mi-
croscopy (STM) with chemical contrast.[36] Phenomena such as
2D intermixing,[714] adsorption,[6,1532] or the catalytic/electroca-
talytic reactivity[3335] have been investigated and linked to the
atomic scale structure of the respective bimetallic surfaces.
For the energetic interpretation of the resulting structures,
in terms of interaction energies between the two components
and of the segregation energies, it is important to know
whether they are thermodynamically stable, at least when ex-
cluding bulk dissolution, or whether they represent a metasta-
ble and possibly ill-defined configuration. Experimentally, this
can be decided, for example, by variation of the preparation
procedure. If significant variation of this procedure or their pa-
rameters results in the same configuration, this is clear evi-
dence for a stable surface configuration, which is metastable
only with respect to bulk dissolution. Because of the general
tendency of surface alloys towards bulk dissolutionthe enor-
mous reservoir of monometallic substrate underneath the 2D
alloy layer of 107 atomic layers will always favor bulk dissolu-
tion at sufficiently high temperatures due to entropy effects
they can be prepared only under conditions where bulk disso-
lution is essentially inhibited. Considering that surface alloys
are generally prepared 1) by deposition of both metal compo-
nents on an inert metal substrate and subsequent thermally in-
duced 2D intermixing or 2) by deposition of submonolayer
amounts of the one component on a substrate of the other
component and subsequent thermal intermixing, exchange be-
tween the two components in the topmost two layers and lat-
eral intermixing in the topmost layer have to be active at tem-
peratures below the onset of bulk dissolution of the deposited
metal species. Often this leaves little room for variation of the
preparation procedure or parameters, and the question for the
thermodynamic stability of the resulting surface alloys can not
be easily answered.
This is topic of the present contribution, where we investi-
gated the stability of laterally equilibrated monolayer PtxRu1x/
Ru(0001) and PdxRu1x/Ru(0001) surface alloys. These surface
alloys have already been characterized structurally, including
the 2D distribution of surface atoms,[29,36] and structure-related
properties relevant for (electro-)catalysis have been investigat-
ed
intensely
[PtRu/Ru(0001),[6,20,25,26,28,31,32,34]
PdRu/
Ru(0001)[29,30]]. It was shown by atomically resolved STM imag-
ing with chemical contrast that surface alloy formation is con-
fined to the exposed outermost atom layer, which means that
virtually no Pt or Pd is present underneath the outermost sur-
face layer or the alloy islands and that loss of deposit material
due to bulk dissolution or desorption is negligible up to cover-
ages of 0.8 ML.[29,36] The confinement of the guest metals Pt
and Pd to the surface layer and therefore the stability of the
surface alloy was associated with the tendency of the guest
metals to stay in the outermost layer, in addition to kinetic ef-
fects such as a lower barrier for exchange between the top-
The stability of PdRu/Ru(0001) and PtRu/Ru(0001) surface
alloys and the tendency for surface segregation of Pd and Pt
subsurface guest metals in these surface alloys is studied by
scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) and Auger electron spec-
troscopy (AES). Atomic resolution STM imaging and AES mea-
surements reveal that upon overgrowing the surface alloys
with a 12 monolayer Ru film and subsequent annealing to
the temperatures required for initial surface alloy formation,
the Ru-covered Pd (Pt) atoms float back to the outermost
layer. The lateral distribution of these species is also essentially
identical to that of the initial surface alloys, before overgrowth
by Ru. In combination, this clearly demonstrates that the sur-
face alloys represent stable surface configurations, metastable
only towards entropically favored bulk dissolution, and that
there is a distinct driving force for surface segregation of these
species. Consequences of these data on the mechanism for
surface alloy formation are discussed.

most two layers as compared to bulk diffusion.[3739] Herein, the
stability of these surface alloys and the tendency for segrega-
tion were investigated by depositing a cover layer of 12 ML
of Ru on top of the equilibrated surface alloys and subsequent
annealing. Comparison of the resulting surface structures with
those of the equilibrated surface alloys before Ru deposition
should give a clear answer on the questions raised above. If
there is a strong tendency for segregation of the guest metals
Pd and Pt, these should float up upon annealing and lead to
2D structures identical to those of the original equilibrated sur-
face alloys. Floating of buried

2. Results and Discussion
Submonolayer deposition of Pt[6,36,59,60] or Pd[14,29,61] on a
Ru(0001) single crystal at 300 K results in pseudomorphic and
triangular-shaped islands with opposite orientation on consec-
utive terraces separated by steps of monolayer height. Subse-
quent flash annealing to 1350 K [PtRu/Ru(0001)[36]] or 10 s an-
nealing at 1150 K [PdRu/Ru(0001)[29]] leads to surface alloys
with equilibrated lateral atom distribution of the surface
atoms. While PtRu/Ru(0001) is characterized by a random atom
distribution,[36] PdRu/Ru(0001) shows a distinct tendency for 2D
clustering.[29]
The floating behavior was studied in detail by following the
variation in the surface morphology and structure during a
series of four preparation steps: 1) deposition of Pt (Pd) on
Ru(0001), 2) surface alloy formation by annealing to 1350 K
(annealing at 1150 K for 10 s), 3) deposition of Ru on the sur-
face alloy at 500 K, and 4) re-alloying by annealing to 1350 K
(annealing at 1150 K for 10 s). After each preparation step de-
tailed STM measurements were performed to determine the
morphology, composition and atom distribution of the respec-
tive surface. The island growth of Pt and Pd on Ru(0001) at
300 K as well as the morphology and the atom distribution of
the surface alloys formed after annealing are shown in Fig-
ures 1ac and Figures 2ac, respectively. In both cases, the
island growth behavior during the initial deposition step illus-
trated in Figure 1a and Figure 2a resembles that reported pre-
viously.[6,14,29,36,60] After surface alloy formation, the surface mor-
phology has changed in a characteristic way, including the for-
mation of rounded monolayer islands or, on smaller terraces,
the attachment at ascending steps (Figure 1b, Figure 2b), in
full agreement with previous observations.[29,36] Atomically re-
solved STM images with chemical contrast (Figure 1c, Fig-
ure 2c) reveal that the deposited amount of 0.7 ML Pt (Fig-
ure 1a) and 0.44 ML Pd (Figure 2a) is completely conserved in
the outermost layer. Subsequently, both surfaces were covered
with a 12 ML film of substrate metal by Ru deposition at
500 K sample temperature [PtRu/Ru(0001): 1.13 ML Ru, PdRu/
Ru(0001): 1.2 ML Ru]. The resulting surface morphologies are il-
lustrated in Figure 1d and Figure 2d. Both surfaces show dis-
tinct island morphology. As discussed in more detail below,
there is a characteristic difference between the two systems.
Whereas for Ru1.2/Pd0.44Ru0.56/Ru(0001), the islands exhibit a typ-
ical layer-by-layer growth, with the first layer of Ru islands
almost filled and the second layer beginning to be populated,
Ru1.13/Pt0.70Ru0.30/Ru(0001) shows a distinct growth of bilayer is-
lands. Subsequent annealing to the respective surface alloying

Segregation and Stability in Surface Alloys
nealing for 10 s at 1150 K for PdRu/Ru(0001)] restores the sur-
face morphologies observed after the initial surface alloy for-
mation (Figure 1b, Figure 2b), with rounded islands on larger
terraces or attachment at ascending steps on smaller ones
(Figure 1e, Figure 2e). Quantitative evaluation of atomically re-
solved STM images of the re-alloyed surface yielded surface
compositions of Pt0.66Ru0.34/Ru(0001) and Pd0.44Ru0.56/Ru(0001),
respectively, with a composition accuracy of 0.02 and the
random or clustered, respectively, atom distribution typical for
these systems. Hence, almost all buried Pt atoms float up to
the outermost layer, accompanied by only a slight Pt loss of
about 6% (relative loss), and essentially no loss, within the
error of the experiment, for the PdRu/Ru(0001) surface alloy.
To further support these observations, both experimental se-
quences were repeated and characterized by AES after each
preparation step. For better visualization and comparability
with each other, the AE spectra are normalized on a constant
intensity of the main Ru peak at 273 eV (RuMNN), so that
changes in the intensity of the main Pt peak at 64 eV (PtMNN)
directly indicate the changes in the I(PtMNN)/I(RuMNN) intensity
ratio and therefore in the Pt amount present in the outermost
atom layer. The AE spectra were recorded after each step of
the experimental sequence described above. In Figures 3ad,
the Auger spectra of the PtRu/Ru(0001) sequence are com-
pared. A characteristic spectrum recorded after the initial Pt
deposition is presented in Figure 3a, with an intensity ratio
I(PtMNN)/I(RuMNN) of 0.25. After surface alloy formation (Fig-
ure 3b), the characteristic shape of the spectrum and the in-
tensity ratio I(PtMNN)/I(RuMNN) (0.24) remain constant, which con-
firms that within the precision of the measurement all Pt
atoms stay in the outermost atom layer and neither Pt diffu-
sion into the Ru bulk nor Pt de-
sorption from the Ru(0001) sur-
face occur during flash anneal-
ing to 1350 K. After deposition
of
1.13 ML
Ru
onto
the
Pt0.70Ru0.30/Ru(0001) surface alloy
at 500 K, the I(PtMNN)/I(RuMNN) in-
tensity
ratio
decreases
signifi-
cantly, to 0.11, due to the partial
burying of the Pt atoms (Fig-
ure 3c).
Re-alloying
by
subse-
quent flash annealing to 1350 K
restores the intensity ratio ob-
served before on the original
surface alloy [I(PtMNN)/I(RuMNN)=
0.22, Figure 3d].

trated

After
deposition of 0.44 ML [I(PdMNN)/

an-
nealing at 1150 K results in a
Pd0.44Ru0.56/Ru(0001) surface alloy
with no measurable Pd loss due
to bulk diffusion or desorption
[I(PdMNN)/I(RuMNN)=0.33,
Fig-
ure 3 f]. Subsequent deposition of 1.2 ML Ru at 500 K leads to
a significant decrease of the I(PdMNN)/I(RuMNN) intensity ratio,
due to burying of the surface Pd by a Ru monolayer [I(PdMNN)/
I(RuMNN)=0.20, Figure 3 g], Finally, annealing at 1150 K com-
pletely

composition
of
the

[I(PdMNN)/I(RuMNN)=0.32,

Hence, the AES results confirm the findings of the STM mea-
surements, with an (almost) complete restoration of the origi-
nal surface alloy composition after Ru deposition and subse-
quent re-alloying, indicative of (almost) complete segregation
of the buried Pd (Pt) to the surface layer, and a slight loss of Pt
during the re-alloying step.
The slight differences in the stability of the surface alloy may
be caused by the lower Pd content (44%) in the surface alloy
compared to Pt (70%). As already demonstrated for both sys-
tems earlier, subsurface/bulk diffusion becomes more pro-
nounced, or even starts only at higher content of the deposit-
ed metal.[29,36] Another reason might be different tendencies
for surface segregation. The preference for surface segregation
of a metal atom dissolved in a host metal is related to the dif-
ference in surface energies of the two species and the differ-
ence of the two optimal nearest-neighbor distances of host
and guest metal.[6265] The surface energies decrease in the
order Ru(0001) (1.31.6 eVatom1), Pt(111) (1 eVatom1) and
Pd(111) (0.8 eVatom1),[6669] in good agreement with the ob-
served tendency for segregation of Pt and Pd. Also the size
mismatch of the larger guest metals Pt (0.277 nm) and Pd
(0.275 nm) compared to the Ru(0001) single crystal (0.270 nm)
would favor the inclusion of the impurity metals in the tensile
stressed outermost Ru layer, providing additional driving force
for surface segregation. Recently, DFT based calculations yield-

ed segregation energies of 0.8 eV for Pt and 1.0 eV for Pd
dissolved (at infinite dissolution) in Ru(0001).[68,70] Based on
these data, considering only exchange between the surface
layer and the subsurface region consisting of the second (bulk
dissolution inhibited) and using the annealing temperatures of
1350 K and 1150 K, respectively, the probability that a small
amount of Pt (Pd) on Ru(0001) is dissolved in the subsurface
region (buried by a layer of substrate material) during surface
alloy formation can be estimated by a simple Boltzmann ap-
proach given by Equation (1):
pbury  exp  DEseg

This estimate results in very low probabilities of 0.16% to
bury Pt in the subsurface region for PtRu/Ru(0001)[36] and of
0.004% for Pd in PdRu/Ru(0001),[29] which are negligible within
the experimental accuracy. Hence, the slight differences in the
segregation behavior of Pd and Pt observed in our experi-
ments must be due to effects not considered in this simple
model.
Previous studies had provided clear evidence that during
the initial stages of PtRu/Ru(0001)[36] and PdRu/Ru(0001)[14]
monolayer surface alloy formation, growth of mixed islands
occurs on Pt (Pd) free areas only. For PtRu/Ru(0001), this was
additionally supported by results of further experiments. First,
during Pt deposition on Ru(0001) at elevated temperatures
(500600 K), Pt atoms prefer to adsorb on the Ru substrate
rather than on the pseudomorphic Pt islands grown thereon.[36]
Furthermore, Ru was observed to grow in bilayer islands upon
deposition on Pt(111) at 400500 K[71] or upon deposition on
pseudomorphically grown Pt islands on Ru(0001) at 500
600 K.[72] These observations show that both, Pt and Ru depos-
its prefer adsorption on Ru3 sites rather than on Pt3 sites. This
is supported also by the present findings, by the growth be-
havior of Ru on the Pt0.70Ru0.30/Ru(0001) and Pd0.44Ru0.56/
Ru(0001) surface alloys (Figure 1d, Figure 2d). A closer look at
the Ru-overgrown bimetallic surfaces is given in Figure 4. Rep-
resentative height profiles along the black-white dashed lines

posit. Similar to the growth behavior on Pt/Ru(0001), Ru

Pt0.70Ru0.30/Ru(0001) surface alloy proceeds via formation of bi-
layer islands (Figure 4a), in full agreement with a much stron-
ger adsorption strength of Ru on Ru3 sites rather than on Pt
(or a Pt dominated PtRu surface alloy layer). In contrast, Ru
overgrowth of the Pd0.44Ru0.56/Ru(0001) surface alloy under sim-
ilar growth conditions exhibits essentially a layer-by-layer
growth behavior (Figure 4b). Possible reasons for this differ-
ence in growth behavior may be the lower Pd surface content
as compared to the Pt surface content, the distinct differences
in the 2D distribution of the components in the surface alloy,
with a much higher fraction of Ru3 sites in PdRu/Ru(0001) [2D

Segregation and Stability in Surface Alloys
clustering] than in PtRu/Ru(0001) [random distribution] or a
less pronounced difference between Ru adsorption on Pd and
on Ru as compared to overgrowth on Pt and Ru. Based on the
present data, we can not rule out any of these contributions,
although a combination of the first two effects appears as
most likely.
A recent STM study of the processes occurring during PtRu/
Ru(0001) surface alloy formation at 850900 K had provided
convincing evidence that at these low temperatures surface
alloy formation starts by detachment of Pt atoms from the
edges of the Pt islands and step decorations, which were
formed during preceding Pt deposition (deposition at room
temperature), and the reversible exchange of the diffusing Pt
adatoms with terrace Ru atoms.[36] Because both, Ru and Pt
adatoms prefer to adsorb on Ru3 sites rather than on sites con-
taining Pt,[36,72] only Pt-free areas are overgrown under these
conditions. Lateral exchange at the interface between Pt step
decorations and former Ru steps was excluded at this tempera-
ture.[36] Since the temperature required for reaching a laterally
equilibrated surface alloy is much higher (1350 K) than the
temperatures used for studying the onset of surface alloy for-
mation, it cannot be excluded that at the higher temperature
also lateral PtRu exchange processes take place. But because
of the much lower kinetic barrier for the vertical exchange pro-
cess observed already at 850900 K, this process is likely to
dominate at higher temperatures as well. A similar scenario for
surface alloy formation was predicted also for PdRu/Ru(0001)
by Rougemaille et al. based on STM and low-energy electron
microscopy (LEEM) measurements.[14] Therefore, we expect that
the up-floating of buried, subsurface Pt (Pd) atoms to the out-
ermost layer (at the experimental temperatures of 1150 or
1350 K) occurs via a similar Pt(Pd)Ru place exchange, most
likely at Ru island edges or by exchange with diffusing Ru ad-
atoms detached from the Ru islands. This mechanism closely
resembles
that
predicted
earlier
for
surfactant
mediated
growth, such as for Sb-mediated Ag(111) homoepitaxy.[41,42]
Though we have no direct evidence for that, these exchange
processes may involve and be assisted by vacancies or fluctu-
ating pinhole defects in the Ru film covering the alloyed sub-
surface layer, as predicted previously for vertical surfactant
transport.[73,74]
The mechanistic information and conclusions are summar-
ized in the Scheme in Figure 5. At the respective annealing
temperatures, Ru atoms can detach from the island edges (a),
diffuse over the uncovered surface alloy (b) and exchange with
Pt atoms in the surface alloy layer (b,c). Upon detachment of
the edge atom, a Ru edge atom from the second layer will
drop down to the first island layer (a). Previous calculations by
Feibelman had shown that for diffusion of a Pt adatom across
a step edge on a stepped Pt(111) surface, a mechanism involv-
ing incorporation of the upper terrace adatom into the step
edge and simultaneous expulsion of the step edge atom to
the lower terrace is energetically favored compared to direct
migration of the Pt adatom across the step edge.[75] Therefore
we expect a similar mechanism also in the present case, for
the detachment of a second layer edge atom of the bilayer Ru
islands. The subsequent exchange processes are already possi-
ble at 500700 K.[71] The resulting mobile Pt adatoms may un-
dergo reversible exchange with other surface atoms or attach
at existing island edges or steps (c). The same may happen
also with Ru adatoms (d), which results in the pronounced
island growth observed experimentally (on sufficiently large
terraces, Figure 1e) or attachment at ascending steps (on
smaller terraces, Figure 1e,Figure 2e). Similar exchange pro-
cesses may happen also directly at the island edge (e,f), if over-
grown Pt atoms are present in the surface alloy layer at these
positions, and at the ascending edge of fluctuating pinholes in
the Ru film. With decreasing Pt content in the overgrown sur-
face alloy layer, the energetic stabilization of the bilayer islands
disappears.[71] At the end, the overgrown Pt atoms are com-
pletely transferred into the new surface layer, and the remain-
ing islands are of monolayer height (f). A similar scheme is pro-
posed also for Ru/PdRu/Ru(0001), with the exception that
there is no decay of bilayer islands.
3. Summary and Conclusions
We have investigated the stability and segregation behavior of
monolayer PdRu/Ru(0001) and PtRu/Ru(0001) surface alloys by
atomically resolved STM imaging with chemical contrast and
AES measurements. Using Pd0.44Ru0.56/Ru(0001) and Pt0.70Ru0.30/
Ru(0001) surface alloys as examples, we could demonstrate, by
overgrowing the equilibrated surface alloys with a Ru film of
slightly more than one monolayer in thickness and subsequent
annealing to temperatures required for initial surface alloy for-
mation, that after the second annealing step the outermost
surface layer is again transformed to PdRu/Ru(0001) and PtRu/
Ru(0001) monolayer surface alloys with Pt or Pd contents very
close (Pt) or essentially identical (Pd) to the initial ones. Fur-
thermore, also the 2D distribution of the surface species close-
ly resembles those in the initial surface alloys, with distinct 2D

clustering for Pd0.44Ru0.56/Ru(0001) and a random distribution
for Pt0.70Ru0.30/Ru(0001). This confirms that the surface alloys
indeed represent stable surface configurations, metastable
only towards entropically favored bulk dissolution, and that
there is a distinct driving force for surface segregation of Pd
and Pt guest species in Ru(0001) subsurface regions. The ob-
servation of a distinct bilayer island growth of Ru on the
Pt0.70Ru0.30/Ru(0001) surface alloy at 500 K, in contrast to the
layer-by-layer Ru growth on Pd0.44Ru0.56/Ru(0001) under similar
growth conditions, may be attributed to the lower Pd content,
the different 2D distribution of the components in the latter
surface alloy with more Ru3 surface sites as compared to
Pt0.70Ru0.30/Ru(0001), or to a less pronounced difference be-
tween RuRu bonding and RuPd bonding. In an atomistic
picture, the initial formation of the surface alloys and their re-
covery after overgrowth by Ru can both be explained by ex-
change processes between adatoms and underlying surface
atoms in combination with a preferential overgrowth of Ru
areas as opposed to Pt- or Pd-containing or dominated re-
gions, due to the stronger bonding of both Pt and Pd as well
as Ru to Ru than to Pt or Pd.
Since these findings represent general properties of PdRu/
Ru(0001) and PtRu/Ru(0001) surface alloys, they are representa-
tive for a wide range of compositions. Furthermore, we sug-
gest that the surface alloy formation process and the floating
effect are generic for many surface alloys that are stabilized by
a sufficiently negative surface segregation energy of guest
metal atoms within the subsurface or bulk region of the host
metal.
Experimental Section
The measurements were carried out in a stainless steel ultrahigh
vacuum (UHV) system containing standard facilities for sample
preparation and characterization and a home-built STM.[76] Details
about the Ru(0001) substrate preparation have been published
earlier.[29;36;77] In short, on a used sample this included Ar+ bom-
bardment (1015 min, 0.5 keV, 5 mAcm2), a sequence of flash an-
nealing runs (typically 3 runs, 16501700 K), oxygen exposure (1
10 Langmuir) below 800 K, followed by 24 final flash annealing
runs (16501700 K). Sample temperatures were measured by opti-
cal pyrometers (IMPAC IGA140 and KELLER PB50AFS13). Pt and Ru
were deposited using electron beam evaporators (Omicron EFM 3),
while deposition of Pd was performed via a resistively heated
Knudsen cell (WA Technology/Tectra). During evaporation, the pres-
sure stayed below 61010 mbar for Pt and Ru, and below 5
109 mbar for Pd. In all cases, the evaporation rate was between
0.11 and 0.14 MLmin1. The respective sample temperatures are
given in the text. Atomically resolved STM imaging with chemical
contrast[3,5,6] allowed to unambiguously identify different surface
species (for constant current mode, tunnel parameters see figure
captions). In these images Pt and Pd appear as dark atoms, while
Ru surface atoms turn out as bright features. The difference is
caused by the different electronic properties of the surface atoms.
