Steam reforming of ethanol/gasoline mixtures: Deactivation, regeneration and stable performance
Abstract
The steam reforming of 85% pure ethanol, 15% gasoline (E85) with and without sulfur was studied over a bimetallic precious metal (Rh/Pt) catalyst deposited on a ceramic monolith. Tests performed at low space velocities (22,000 h1) confirmed that the catalyst could achieve 100% ethanol and gasoline conversion to equilibrium concentrations of H2, CO, CO2 and CH4 with no signs of deactivation for at least 110 h reforming a sulfur-free E85 fuel. In the presence of 5 ppm sulfur the catalyst maintained 100% ethanol and 100% gasoline conversion for approximately 22 h before rapid deactivation resulted in ethanol conversion values below 21%. TPO analysis established large carbon deposits had formed on the catalyst surface demonstrating that sulfur promoted carbon formation. Following such extensive deactivation full activity was recovered after treating the catalyst with air; however subsequent deactivation occurred more rapidly indicating that some amount of permanent damage had occurred. A process with preemptive regeneration via air treatment was studied and it was found to extend the period of stable activity.

Highlights
 Small amounts of sulfur deactivate the catalyst.  Air regeneration restores activity but subsequent deactivation occurs more rapidly.  Sulfur is not the sole cause of irreversible deactivation.  Catalyst chemistry altered with extended periods of time reforming.  Intermediates of acetaldehyde and ethylene detected during deactivation.
1. Introduction
Increasing concerns about the environmental impact of vehicles with gasoline powered combustion engines have increased efforts to find technologies to reduce emissions and reduce fossil fuel consumption. Recently there has been an increased focus on generating transportation fuels from renewable resources, in particular on efforts to convert cellulosic feedstock into ethanol via conventional fermentation routes and next generation genomic modification routes. Ethanol has a lower vapor pressure relative to gasoline and therefore ethanol/gasoline blends such as E85 (85% ethanol) or E15 (15% ethanol) are more likely to be available then 100% ethanol within the current infrastructure. If hydrogen fuel cell vehicles or hydrogen powered combustion engines are transitioned into the transportation sector hydrogen will initially be produced from fuels available at local service stations. Thus it is important to understand the reforming capabilities of these mixed transportation fuels for hydrogen production.
Previously we reported on steam reforming of pure ethanol with a Rh/Pt catalyst on a zirconia containing carrier
[1]
. In this previous study both non-catalytic and catalytic performance were investigated and two kinetic regimes were identified
[1]
. The current work focuses on studying the reforming of ethanol/gasoline blends. There has been extensive research on the reforming of conventional transportation fuels of gasoline, diesel, or jet fuel and additionally there are many published studies on the reforming of pure ethanol, however, literature on ethanolgasoline blends is limited. Swartz et al. reported on auto-thermal reforming of E85 at 800 C and steam/carbon ratio's of 5:1 and 6:1
[2]
. Assuming gasoline is represented by iso-octane the E85 reforming reaction normalized to 1 mol of fuel is:

A major challenge in steam reforming liquid transportation fuels is catalyst deactivation. It has been found that the presence of higher hydrocarbons in a fuel, specifically aromatics, increase deactivation due to carbon deposition
[3]
. In addition, sulfur, which is also present in many transportation fuels is a known catalyst poison and typically has a detrimental effect on catalyst stability
[4]
. The impact of sulfur on catalyst performance for autothermal reforming transportation fuels has been studied for both synthetic fuels

however, papers by both Wang et al. and Strohm et al. researched the catalytic steam reforming of commercial grade JP8
[15]
,
[21]
.
Noble metal catalysts have been found to be more sulfur tolerant than Ni-based catalysts
[15]
. Several papers that have investigated sulfur tolerance studied the effect of using bimetallic catalysts rather than monometallic; Strohm et al. used a bimetallic NiRh catalyst on CeO2-modified Al2O3 and found that Ni would act as a sacrificial site by adsorbing sulfur preferentially allowing slower deactivation
[15]
, Lakhapatri also found that Ni improved performance when added to rhodium using a RhNi/Al2O3 catalyst
[19]
. Reforming sulfur-free simulated gasoline, Kaila et al. found that the addition of rhodium to platinum on zirconia reduced carbon formation and that the stability of the bimetallic catalyst was improved by increasing the Rh/Pt ratio
[22]
. It has been found that increasing the temperature for reformation reactions or increasing the concentration of steam will reduce catalyst deactivation due to either sulfur poisoning or due to coke deposition
[12]
,
[17]
. However, to optimize the energy efficiency of the reactor, lower temperatures and lower steam concentrations are preferred; therefore a tradeoff typically exists between catalyst stability and efficiency. In this paper deactivation, regeneration and stability of a Rh/Pt catalyst on a zirconia containing carrier is studied for the steam reforming of ethanol/gasoline blends at an energy efficient condition with steam/fuel ratio's slightly higher than stoichiometric (steam/carbon = 1.8) and with temperatures at or near 650 C.
Not many catalyst deactivation studies focus on catalyst regeneration, particularly for reforming of transportation fuels. Pereira et al. observed deactivation due to coke formation during the reforming of pure ethanol with a Co/SiO2 catalyst and studied the regeneration of this catalyst with and without the addition of Rh and Ru
[23]
. They found that air exposure removed carbon deposits and resulted in the return to initial performance with the bimetallic RhCo/SiO2 or RuCo/SiO2 catalysts but did not regenerate the monometallic Co/SiO2 catalyst
[23]
. Cheekatamarla and Ferrandon looked at whether catalyst regeneration could occur by removing sulfur from the feed
[6]
,
[12]
,
[24]
. Ferrandon found that while autothermal reforming of gasoline with 34 ppm sulfur at 800 C activity of a Rh/LaAl2O3 catalyst could be fully recovered after deactivation by switching to a sulfur-free fuel; the same procedure performed at 700 C resulted in 50% recovery of activity
[12]
. Cheekatamarla found that autothermal reforming synthetic diesel with and without the addition of 150 ppm H2S the activity of the Pt/CeO2 catalyst could be partially recovered after switching to reforming the sulfur-free fuel
[6]
.
The objective of this study is to understand catalyst deactivation in order to develop a process for reforming E85 at less energy intensive conditions. The process of regeneration and preemptive air treatment is studied as a method for maintaining catalyst stability.
2. Experimental
2.1. Catalyst preparation
A commercially available BASF Rh/Pt reforming catalyst (RM-75ST) consisting of 4 wt% precious metal on a zircona-based support was used for all catalytic tests; its preparation is described elsewhere
[1]
. In the catalyst's fresh state the surface rhodium was found by XPS analysis to be purely oxidized and thus the precious metal is likely in a segregated state. The catalyst was deposited on cordierite monoliths (Corning) which were 1.90 cm (0.75 in.) in diameter and 1.27 cm (0.5 in.) long. Two washcoat loadings were used: one with standard loading of 0.12 g/cm3 (2.0 g/in.3) and one with reduced loading of 0.015 g/cm3 (0.25 g/in.3). Two sulfur-containing fuels were studied: a commercial grade E85 with 28 ppm sulfur, and a simulated E85 made by combining 85% liquid volume pure ethanol (Sigma Aldrich, 99.9% purity) with 15% liquid volume commercial gasoline. The commercial gasoline contained 32 ppm sulfur and therefore the simulated E85 had a total sulfur concentration of 5 ppm. Both the E85 and the gasoline were purchased from a local service station, and the sulfur content of each was determined by Herguth Laboratories by X-Ray Flourescense (ASTM D4294). In addition to the two sulfur containing fuels, a sulfur-free E85 was prepared by combining 85% liquid volume pure ethanol (Sigma Aldrich, 99.9%) with 15% liquid volume sulfur-free gasoline provided by Conoco Chevron.
The reduced loading washcoat had a BET surface area of 227 m2/g and a metal dispersion of 31.83%, as assessed by CO chemisorptions with a Micrometrics Autochem 2910. The CO chemisorption was carried out by reducing the catalyst with H2 at 400 C prior to a pulse CO chemisorption measurement at room temperature. A 1:1 ratio was assumed between CO and Pt and also between CO and Rh. Due to varying stoichiometry between CO and Rh, the metal dispersion was understood to be an approximate measure.
2.2. Reactor apparatus and procedure
Recent experiments in our laboratory showed decomposition of ethanol on the walls of a stainless steel reactor and coking under reforming conditions
[1]
. To avoid this, all currently described tests were conducted in a quartz tube reactor with an experimental set-up described elsewhere
[1]
. A Razel model R-99 syringe pump was added to the apparatus to inject liquid gasoline into a stream of nitrogen, steam, and ethanol vapor. A steam/carbon ratio of 1.8 was maintained in all experiments, and the total gas flow was adjusted to either a low space velocity of 22,000 h1 or a high space velocity of 44,000 h1. The reactor was heated with an electric furnace to 650 C. Reactor temperature was monitored by thermocouples placed 3.2 mm upstream and 3.2 mm downstream from the monolith. The reactor effluent was sampled using a micro gas chromatograph (Agilent Micro GC 3000) equipped with inlet heaters and four columns: two molecular sieve columns for measuring H2, N2, CH4, and CO; and both a PlotQ column and an OV-1 column for measuring CO2, C2H4, H2O, C2H5OH, and C2H4O. Nitrogen was used as an internal standard to establish the molar flow rate and carry out atom balances. The product distributions of all tests were normalized for nitrogen content. Heat balance calculations were performed by comparing the measured temperature difference between the inlet and outlet thermocouples with an adiabatic temperature differential based on the enthalpies of the products at the outlet temperature.
2.3. Catalyst characterization
A Thermo Fisher K Alpha XPS equipped with AL K(alpha) monochromatic source was used for XPS testing. Intact washcoated monolith sections were removed from the radial center of the sample and were taken both from the inlet and outlet end of the monolith and were mounted on carbon tape for analysis. Additionally, washcoat samples were scraped from the monolith, ground with a mortar, and placed on double sided tape for analysis. The run conditions were as follows: pass energy = 40 eV (high resolution analysis) and pass energy = 150 eV for low resolution survey scan analysis. Vacuum conditions were 9 × 108 torr or better and spot size = 400 μm with 90 analyses angle. Data was analyzed using Thermo Fisher Avantage software and Scofield sensitivity factors
[25]
. Binding energies were referenced to the ubiquitous C1s = 285.0 eV.
Thermogravimetry (TG) and differential thermoanalysis (DTA) were performed with a TGDTA/DSC apparatus (Netzsch STA 409 PC Luxx). Ultra high purity nitrogen was used as a purge and protective gas for all tests. For temperature programmed oxidation (TPO) experiments, the temperature was ramped at 5 C/min from 25 C to 900 C with gas flow rates of 80 mL/min (50% dry air, 50% dry N2). The effluent of the TPO tests was analyzed with an Agilent 5973 mass spectrometer (MS). ICP sulfur analysis was completed with a Perkin Elmer 2001 DV ICP spectrometer after acid digestion with HClO4 and HF.
2.4. Thermodynamic calculations
Equilibrium product distributions at specified temperatures and pressures were calculated by minimizing the Gibbs free energy using GASEQ, which is a graphical user interface to the STANJAN equilibrium program. The product species included in the analysis were those that had been identified during experimental tests. The temperature and pressure parameters used in the calculations were taken from experimental readings at the inlet of the monolith. Inlet temperatures were used because outlet temperatures varied among some of the tests which had significant catalyst deactivation.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Sulfur-free E85: effect of space time
Aging tests were performed with sulfur-free E85 under two sets of experimental conditions where the space velocities and catalyst loadings differed. At both the low and high space velocity condition a steam/carbon ratio of 1.8 was maintained (stoichiometric steam/carbon ratio is 1.6 according to Eq.
(1)
). For the low space velocity condition and high catalyst loading (washcoat loading 0.12 g/cm3 and GHSV 22,000 h1) it was found that the catalyst reformed the ethanol/gasoline mix to equilibrium product distribution with no change in activity for at least 110 h on stream. The results of the test are shown in
Fig. 1
. During this run ethanol was not detected in the effluent, thus ethanol conversion was maintained at 100% and atom balances indicated that both the ethanol and gasoline were fully converted to the major product species shown in
Fig. 1

The sulfur-free E85 was then tested with a lower catalyst washcoat loading (0.015 g/cm3) and higher GHSV (44,000 h1). The result of a 4 h run at these conditions is shown in
Fig. 2
. Deactivation was measured immediately upon introducing reactants. After 4 h on stream the ethanol conversion had dropped from 100% to 97% and hydrogen production rates had decreased by 14%. Selectivity to both hydrogen and carbon dioxide decreased whereas selectivity towards methane and carbon monoxide increased. Thus for the low space velocity condition no deactivation was measured for at least 110 h on stream whereas for the high space velocity condition deactivation was measured immediately.

During the high space velocity test, in addition to the major gas species, C2 species of ethylene, acetaldehyde and ethane were observed in the effluent. It was reported in previous work that reforming pure ethanol at high space velocity produced both acetaldehyde and ethylene with the same catalyst used in this study
[1]
at high space velocity conditions through Reactions

(3)
Once produced, the ethylene may undergo hydrogenation to yield ethane:
(4)
C2H4 + H2  C2H6
These C2 species, specifically ethylene, may be precursors to coke formation and thus be responsible for the change in catalyst stability for high space velocity. Ethylene is a known coke precursor
[3]
. Alternatively Noronha et al. propose that the higher stability at low space velocities is due to the ability of the coke to fully gasify from the catalyst surface under these conditions
[26]
. Noronha et al. studied the impact of space velocity on catalyst stability for pure ethanol oxidative reforming and found that coking was favored at intermediate space velocity conditions and not at either the high or low space velocity conditions
[26]
. Thus it is possible that either carbon is more easily formed at high space velocity conditions by the presence of intermediate species or that carbon is not able to fully gasify from the surface at these conditions. Given either of these conclusions it is possible that deactivation only occurs at the high space velocity condition. However, it is also possible that the deactivation for the low space velocity test has not yet been realized. Future work will confirm that deactivation does not occur during the low space velocity test (
Fig. 1
) by extending the run time, monitoring temperature throughout the catalyst bed and performing characterization of the used monolith following the reactor test.
3.2. E85 reforming with sulfur: the impact of sulfur
The reforming of E85 containing 5 ppm sulfur was studied at the low space velocity condition described in Section
3.1
(steam/carbon = 1.8, washcoat loading = 0.12 g/cm3 and GHSV = 22,000 h1). At these conditions, for which no deactivation was measured reforming the sulfur-free fuel, significant catalyst deactivation was measured with sulfur. The product distribution for major gas species is shown in
Fig. 3
. Initially, the catalyst reformed the sulfur containing fuel to equilibrium product distribution and full conversion, yielding the same result as the sulfur-free fuel. However, after 22 h on stream unreacted ethanol was detected and this coincided with changes in the measured concentrations of major gas species and with initial detection of ethylene, acetaldehyde and ethane in the effluent. After 60 h on stream higher hydrocarbons species such as benzene, isooctane, butadiene, were detected in trace amounts indicating that the catalyst was no longer reforming higher hydrocarbons present in the gasoline. Catalyst activity appeared to stabilize at conversions of approximately 21% after 105 h on stream. The initial and final product yields for this test are shown in
Table 1
. During the test outlet temperatures increased from 628 C to 654 C; thus the overall reaction became less endothermic with time on stream. Cheekatamarla found that during ATR of diesel fuel on a Pt/Ceria catalyst that outlet temperature increased during reforming of sulfur-containing diesel whereas it decreased during reforming of sulfur-free diesel and attributed this difference to the suppression of endothermic steam reforming reactions by the sulfur
[6]
. Mayne et al. found a similar result reforming isooctane with and without sulfur on a Ni/Ceriazirconia catalyst
[9]
. In
Table 1
equilibrium concentrations are given for 650 C and are calculated assuming gasoline as pure isooctane.

Following the 105 h test TPO was conducted on the deactivated washcoated monolith according to the protocol given in Section
2.3
. During the test, total mass loss amounted to approximately 8.7 wt% of monolith mass. The results of this test are shown in
Fig. 4
. The primary exothermic energy peak (not shown) and mass loss peak occurred between 500 and 650 C. Further, CO2 was measured with a mass spectrometer during the TPO test and it was verified that the burn-off was complete at 650 C as shown in
Fig. 4
. Significant carbon formation on the aged catalyst prior to TPO was confirmed by XPS (see Section
3.4
). Thus the product distribution at the end of the test (
Table 1
) was either produced on a heavily carbon covered surface or via thermal reactions. In previous work it was found that ethanol decomposition could occur due to non-catalytic thermal reactions
[1]
. A test was done in the absence of a catalyst at these conditions and ethanol conversion was 5% with the primary products being hydrogen and acetaldehyde, therefore the product distribution and conversion at 105 h shown (that include more ethylene) in
Table 1
is likely the result of reactions on the coke covered catalyst rather than thermal reactions. During the non-catalytic test only 0.028% of the ethanol was converted to ethylene whereas during the catalytic test, after 105 h 55% of the ethanol is converted to ethylene. The results suggest that ethylene can be produced on a coke covered surface. If coke simultaneously deactivates the catalyst and promotes coke production an exponential deactivation mechanism could result.

The results shown in
Fig. 3
and
Table 1
, in conjunction with the XPS and TPO analyses, demonstrate that sulfur promotes carbon formation, since deactivation was not measured under these conditions in the absence of sulfur. Strohm et al. found that increased sulfur coverage led to increased carbon formation on a RhNi/Ce-modified Al2O3 catalyst and suggested that sulfur was the primary cause of deactivation and carbon formation contributed to deactivation only after a specific SRh ratio was reached
[15]
. Other authors have also suggested that sulfur poisoning promotes carbon formation in studies on either ATR or steam reforming fuels with rhodium catalysts

[14]

[27]
or platinum catalysts

.
Despite the significant impact of sulfur, XPS tests on the aged catalyst did not measure sulfur indicating that the sulfur did not adsorb on the surface of the aged catalyst or that the amount was less than the XPS detection limits. ICP tests were done on the sample washcoat to compliment the XPS data and the analyses measured 382 ppm total sulfur (atomic fraction); therefore an atomic ratio of approximately 1:1000 sulfur to precious metal. Thus, although the catalyst had considerable exposure to sulfur only a small fraction of sulfur remained. It is likely that these small amounts of sulfur measured by ICP are not the sole cause of deactivation and rather that sulfur is able to temporarily adsorb to the surface and induce changes to the mechanism or catalyst surface. The exact mechanism or surface modification through which sulfur deactivates the catalyst is not explained in this study. Further, ICP will not indicate the form or the location of the sulfur thus it is unknown whether sulfur adsorbs on active sites or the catalyst support.
3.3. Aging tests at process conditions with sulfur and regeneration
The results in Section
3.2
indicate that ppm-range sulfur concentrations shortens the period of measured stable activity and deactivates the catalyst to a performance level which is unacceptable for industrial production of hydrogen. Given this, it was important to understand if any aspect of the deactivation was reversible, and if so, what methods were capable of regenerating the deactivated catalyst. To determine whether catalyst regeneration was possible, the catalyst was deactivated to various extents and regeneration was attempted in atmospheres of: 100% N2, 80% N2/20% steam and 50% N2/50% air. The initial regeneration tests were completed on catalysts used to reform the commercial grade fuel containing 28 ppm sulfur. The conditions for this test were the same as those for the 5 ppm simulated E85 used in Section
3.2
. Similar to the results for the 5 ppm sulfur fuel, the catalyst was capable of reforming the higher sulfur containing fuel to the estimated equilibrium product distribution and full conversion but measured deactivation occurred after some period of time on stream. Reforming the 28 ppm sulfur fuel, catalyst deactivation was measured after 14 h on stream. Thus the fuel with the lower sulfur concentration had a longer period of measured stable activity and selectivity.
After 33 h of reforming the 28 ppm sulfur fuel, ethanol conversion had dropped from 100% to 84% and hydrogen production rates had decreased by 29%. As shown in
Fig. 5
a and b, at this level of deactivation catalyst regeneration was attempted by air treatment with 50% N2, 50% air maintaining the furnace temperature of 650 C and constant GHSV of 22,000 h1 for 1 h. Following the air treatment the catalyst reformed the E85 to 100% conversion and equilibrium product distribution.

Although air treatment was effective at regenerating the catalyst to measured levels of initial activity, deactivation following the air treatment occurred more rapidly. After the first air treatment C2 species were detected and hydrogen production decreased after approximately 7 h on stream in contrast to 14 h for the fresh catalyst. Thus the measured period of stability was shortened. Nineteen hours after the initial air treatment the extent of deactivation was the same as that measured after the first 33 h on stream and a second air treatment was performed.
A total of three air treatments were conducted during this test and the results are shown in
Fig. 5
a and b. After both the second and third air treatments initial activity was achieved but no period of stability was measured; conversion values decreased and ethylene, acetaldehyde and ethane were detected in the effluent within 20 min of the introduction of reactants, as shown in
Fig. 5
b. The production rates of these C2 species were higher after the first and second regenerations. This indicated that although air treatments were effective at reproducing initial measured performance it did not return the catalyst to its initial chemical and/or structural state.
In addition to air treatment, at these conditions regeneration was attempted with both pure nitrogen and with nitrogen/steam. After an intermediate level of deactivation (85% ethanol conversion) neither the pure nitrogen nor the nitrogen/steam environment had any effect on the measured catalyst performance. In Section
3.2
it was found that coke was likely forming during the sulfur promoted catalyst deactivation. Therefore, it is likely that deactivation is occurring by coke deposition that is not being gasified by the steam at 650 C and must instead be removed with oxygen. This may occur because of the nature of the carbon or the experimental conditions (i.e. residence time). During the 1 h air treatments CO2 was measured in the effluent and exotherms were measured across the monolith. For this test gas chromatograph measurements were only taken every three minutes and therefore did not provide sufficient CO2 effluent measurements from which to determine the total carbon deposition on the monolith surface. Only catalyst regeneration via air treatment was investigated for the remainder of the study, however, it should be noted that regeneration via nitrogen/steam at other conditions may improve catalyst performance.
For the test shown in
Fig. 5
a and b, the fresh catalyst was initially able to achieve the anticipated equilibrium product distribution (
Table 1
) from the commercial grade E85 (28 ppm sulfur). Therefore, the number of catalytic sites available on the fresh catalyst was likely greater than the number required to obtain equilibrium. It is then possible that air treatments were effective at regenerating some, but not all, catalytic sites present on the fresh catalyst. To assess this theory, the same regeneration tests were performed on monoliths which had the lower washcoat loading (0.015 g/cm3) and had reached greater extents of deactivation. One of these tests examined a severely deactivated catalyst to the extent shown in
Table 1
and
Fig. 3
. The results of this test are shown in
Fig. 6
. After this catalyst was exposed to air treatment the catalyst reformed the fuel to the initial measured performance. Based on these results with substantially lower catalyst loading and more severe deactivation it is likely that the air treatments performed during the test shown in
Fig. 5
regenerated all or a large majority of deactivated sites. If air treatments regenerate all deactivated sites, however, the same catalytic performance would be expected following the air treatment; and as shown in both
Fig. 5
,
Fig. 6
the deactivation profiles following the air treatments are different. These results suggest that either air treatments regenerate all sites but do not fully return the catalyst to its initial fresh state (chemically or structurally) or that given these test conditions we were not able to measure the loss in sites.

Air regeneration condition = 50% air, 50% N2.
3.4. Irreversible nature of deactivation
In Section
3.3
it was shown that after various extents of deactivation, air treatments did not return the catalyst to its initial chemical and/or structural state because deactivation occurred more quickly following successive regenerations. The changes to the catalyst could either be due to the exposure of the catalyst to the reforming conditions or exposure to the regeneration conditions. Under the experimental conditions, coking and sulfur are the most likely causes of deactivation. As discussed earlier, coking was evidenced by substantial mass loss during TPO and the generation of CO2 in the effluent during both the TPO tests in Section
3.2
and the reactor tests in Section
3.3
. Sulfur is also suspected of causing deactivation since it often bonds strongly to catalytic sites
[4]
and causes site poisoning. It is possible that the air treatment is unable to fully reverse the effects of coking and sulfur. To determine whether deactivation from coking or sulfur poisoning was reversible, XPS studies were completed on a regenerated catalyst. The washcoated monolith exposed to reforming conditions for 105 h with sulfur containing fuel was placed in the TGA/DTA where it was exposed to 50% N2/50% air at 650 C. Despite the significant coking which occurred during the reforming condition, and the considerable exposure to sulfur, following the oxidative regeneration XPS results found neither sulfur, nor graphitic carbon on the catalyst surface. While XPS is a preferred technique for sulfur analysis because it can identify different sulfur species, as found in Section
3.2
, the amount of sulfur necessary for poisoning is frequently less than the detection limit
[27]
.
In Section
3.2
it had been shown that under high space velocity conditions the catalyst would deactivate while reforming the sulfur-free fuel. If irreversible deactivation was caused solely to sulfur, it was expected that catalyst deactivation as a result of reforming sulfur-free fuel would be readily reversible. To test this hypothesis, regeneration was performed on the catalyst which had undergone deactivation while reforming the sulfur-free fuel at the high space velocity condition (washcoat loading 0.015 g/cm3and GHSV 44,000 h1). Several catalyst regenerations were attempted via air treatment during this test and the results are shown in
Fig. 7
. Consistent with results for the sulfur containing fuel, full activity returned after each regeneration but catalyst performance worsened with successive regeneration attempts. As shown in
Fig. 7
conversion decreased more rapidly following air treatments. Therefore, the catalyst deactivation had an irreversible nature which was seen at both high and low space velocities, and both in the presence and absence of sulfur. These observations suggest that sulfur was not the sole cause of the irreversible aspects of deactivation. Meanwhile, neither the XPS nor TPO results implicate carbon as the primary cause for the irreversibility.

Fig. 7. Reforming sulfur-free E85 with steam/carbon = 1.8, washcoat loading = 0.015 g/cm3 (0.25 g/in.3) and GHSV = 44,000 h1, furnace temperature = 650 C, air regeneration condition = 50% air, 50% N2.
Regeneration conditions could also induce irreversible changes to the catalyst. During air treatment, high surface temperatures are possible when carbon is oxidized from the catalyst surface. It is feasible that these high temperatures during air treatments could cause catalyst sintering which is permanent. In order to test this a run was done under the same conditions as those shown in
Fig. 7
but with a high temperature pre-treatment, at 900 C in N2 for 3 h, to possibly simulate the temperatures experienced by the catalyst during regeneration. The pre-treatment, however, did not affect the behavior of the catalyst after the regenerations: catalyst performance still had different deactivation profiles before and after regeneration. Thus temperature-induced sintering was also not the sole cause of the irreversibility. Other scenarios that could bring about irreversible deactivation include a change in the catalyst chemistry caused by reforming or regeneration conditions; or dispersion changes of precious metal due to non-temperature related sintering, such as oxygen-induced sintering. These and other deactivation mechanisms will be explored in future investigations.

3.4 Irreversible nature of deactivation
it was shown that air treatment could regenerate the catalyst after various levels of deactivation. In an effort to prevent serious decline in catalyst performance, an attempt was made to incorporate periodic air treatments prior to any measured deactivation. This experiment was carried out by reforming commercial grade E85 with 28 ppm sulfur at low space velocity conditions (washcoat loading 0.12 g/cm3and GHSV 22,000 h1), and exposing the catalyst to one hour of air treatment after every 4 h of reforming time. Seven cycles of reforming and air treatment were carried out for a total runtime of 35 h. The product distribution for this test is shown in
Fig. 8
. No C2 species were detected during the duration of the run and 100% ethanol and gasoline conversion was maintained. Therefore, the catalyst exhibited initial activity levels with no sign of deactivation through 28 h steam reforming the E85 with 28 ppm sulfur, whereas the catalyst was able to sustain initial performance for less than 14 h without air treatments (
Fig. 5
). The results imply that a process may be developed with cyclic preemptive regenerations allowing the catalyst to efficiently operate in a stable regime at low temperatures and low water/fuel ratios
[29]
. ICP sulfur analysis was performed on both the cycled and non-cycled samples and it was found that there was 88 ppm and 50 ppm elemental sulfur respectively. The fresh catalyst through XRF analysis was found to have 94 ppm elemental sulfur. Thus it was found that the used catalyst did not have significant sulfur concentrations (in agreement with ICP analysis in Section
3.2
) nor was it found that the cyclic method reduced the extent of sulfur on the surface.

To further understand the mechanism by which these periodic air treatments prolong stable performance, XPS was performed on the catalyst used for 7 cycles of reforming and pre-emptive regeneration. These XPS results were compared with those from a catalyst on stream for 28 h reforming commercial grade E85 but receiving only one air treatment at the end of the 28 h. Thus both catalysts were removed from the reactor after high temperature air exposure and cooling under nitrogen, and both had been exposed to reforming conditions for a total of 28 h. These two samples were compared with a fresh catalyst (calcined in air at 550 C). None of the three samples showed any retained sulfur or carbon on the surface by XPS. The rhodium 3d 5/2 XPS peaks are shown in
Fig. 9
. Both the fresh sample and the cycled sample contained only oxidized rhodium; however it is clear from the XPS data that the sample which had been on stream continuously for 28 h is chemically different. Rhodium binding energies and surface atomic percentages are given in
Table 2
. This likely indicates that a chemical and/or structural change of the catalyst occurs during the reforming condition. This phenomenon would have a time dependent aspect, since it is seen more clearly on the sample which had been exposed to the reforming conditions continuously. This chemical change may also be associated with irreversible aspect of catalyst deactivation. The nature of these chemical changes and their effect on catalyst deactivation and regeneration behavior will be investigated in the future.

4. Conclusions
A Rh/Pt catalyst (BASF SR10D) was capable of reforming sulfur-free E85 to equilibrium concentrations with no signs of deactivation for at least 110 h on stream at low space velocity conditions. Under high space velocity conditions the catalyst was not stable reforming E85 with or without sulfur. It is possible that C2 intermediates, specifically ethylene contribute to the deactivation at these conditions by coking. The addition of 5 ppm sulfur to the fuel led to measured deactivation after 22 h on stream and deactivated the catalyst to an extent where hydrogen production would not be industrially feasible. Regardless of the extent of deactivation air treatment could regenerate the catalyst to initial activity but deactivation occurred more quickly following regeneration. Therefore the catalyst underwent some irreversible change which did not allow full activity to be recovered. Although it was found that sulfur was the primary cause of deactivation it was not the sole cause of the irreversibility in the catalyst deactivation/regeneration process.
A process utilizing preemptive regeneration was able to extend the period of stable activity reforming the sulfur containing fuel. XPS studies revealed that a shift in precious metal oxidation state occurs when the catalyst has been on stream continuously versus with periodic air treatments. Future work will study these changes to the precious metal chemistry.
