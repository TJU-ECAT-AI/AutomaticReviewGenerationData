[1] "Dehydrogenation of cyclohexane to benzene has been carried out over Ni supported on activated carbon cloth ACC (Ni/ACC) catalysts under spray-pulsed mode reactor to study hydrogen evolution for hydrogen storage and supply system applications."

[2] "A small amount of Pt (0.5 wt%) was added to the Ni based catalysts. A synergistic effect was observed in the case of the promoted catalysts the hydrogen production was enhanced by ca. 1.5 times as compared to the 20 wt% Ni only catalyst."

[3] "Selectivity towards dehydrogenation observed to be enhanced by addition of Pt into Ni/ACC catalysts."

The literature provided focuses on a specific case study of cyclohexane dehydrogenation over Ni-based catalysts supported on activated carbon, which is relevant to selective dehydrogenation reactions in hydrogen storage and supply systems. However, it does not provide comprehensive information to fully address the broader scope of the question regarding chemical production, fuel synthesis, and the comparison between reactor studies and UHV studies.

From the available information, we can note that:

1. Selective dehydrogenation reactions, such as cyclohexane to benzene, are significant for hydrogen storage and supply system applications.

2. Reactor studies, specifically using a spray-pulsed mode reactor in this case, contribute to understanding these processes by allowing researchers to measure hydrogen evolution rates and catalyst performance under realistic conditions.

3. The study investigates supported catalysts, specifically Ni on activated carbon cloth (ACC), which is relevant to the focus on supported catalysts mentioned in the question.

4. Key research methods include testing different metal loadings (e.g., 20 wt% Ni) and the addition of promoters (0.5 wt% Pt) to enhance catalyst performance.

5. Reaction conditions investigated include the use of a spray-pulsed reactor, though specific details on temperature, pressure, or other parameters are not provided in the given excerpt.

6. The study demonstrates how catalyst optimization can be informed by such experiments, as the addition of a small amount of Pt significantly enhanced hydrogen production and selectivity towards dehydrogenation.

However, the excerpt does not provide information on UHV studies, characterization techniques, or a broader discussion of C-H and N-H bond dehydrogenation. To fully address the question, additional literature covering these aspects would be necessary.

提供的文献主要关注了在活性炭负载的镍基催化剂上进行环己烷脱氢的具体案例研究，这与氢气储存和供应系统中的选择性脱氢反应相关。然而，它并未提供足够的全面信息来完整回答关于化学生产、燃料合成以及反应器研究与超高真空（UHV）研究比较的更广泛问题。

根据可用信息，我们可以注意到：

1. 选择性脱氢反应，如环己烷到苯的转化，对氢气储存和供应系统应用具有重要意义。

2. 反应器研究，特别是本案例中使用的喷雾脉冲模式反应器，通过允许研究人员在实际条件下测量氢气演化速率和催化剂性能，有助于理解这些过程。

3. 该研究调查了负载型催化剂，特别是活性炭布（ACC）负载的镍，这与问题中提到的对负载型催化剂的关注相关。

4. 关键研究方法包括测试不同的金属负载量（如20 wt%镍）和添加助剂（0.5 wt%铂）以提高催化剂性能。

5. 所研究的反应条件包括使用喷雾脉冲反应器，尽管在给定的摘录中没有提供温度、压力或其他参数的具体细节。

6. 该研究表明，通过这样的实验可以指导催化剂优化，因为添加少量的铂显著提高了氢气产量和脱氢选择性。

然而，摘录没有提供关于UHV研究、表征技术或更广泛的C-H和N-H键脱氢讨论的信息。要全面回答这个问题，还需要涵盖这些方面的额外文献。
