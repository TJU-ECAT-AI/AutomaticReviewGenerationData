The provided literature focuses on a specific case of selective dehydrogenation, namely the dehydrogenation of cyclohexane to benzene, which is relevant to hydrogen storage and supply systems. This study demonstrates the significance of selective dehydrogenation reactions in hydrogen storage applications.

The research method employed in this study involves using a spray-pulsed mode reactor to investigate hydrogen evolution from cyclohexane dehydrogenation. The catalysts used are Ni supported on activated carbon cloth (ACC), with some catalysts further promoted by a small amount of Pt.

Key findings from this reactor study include:

1. The maximum rate of hydrogen evolution using monometallic Ni/ACC catalysts was 8.5 mmol g⁻¹cat min⁻¹ for 20 wt% Ni loading.

2. Addition of a small amount of Pt (0.5 wt%) to Ni-based catalysts resulted in a synergistic effect, enhancing hydrogen production by about 1.5 times compared to the 20 wt% Ni-only catalyst.

3. The 20 wt% Ni-0.5 wt% Pt bimetallic catalyst showed approximately 60 times higher hydrogen production rates compared to a 0.5 wt% monometallic Pt catalyst.

4. The addition of Pt to Ni/ACC catalysts enhanced selectivity towards dehydrogenation.

These findings demonstrate how reactor studies contribute to our understanding of selective dehydrogenation processes, particularly in optimizing catalyst composition for improved performance in hydrogen production and storage applications.

However, this literature does not provide information on UHV studies or specific characterization techniques used. It also does not cover N-H bond dehydrogenation or discuss a wide range of reaction conditions. To fully address the question, additional literature on UHV studies, characterization techniques, and a broader range of dehydrogenation reactions would be necessary.

所提供的文献重点关注选择性脱氢的一个特定案例，即环己烷到苯的脱氢反应，这与氢气储存和供应系统相关。这项研究展示了选择性脱氢反应在氢气储存应用中的重要性。

这项研究采用的研究方法包括使用喷雾脉冲模式反应器来研究环己烷脱氢产生的氢气。使用的催化剂是负载在活性炭布(ACC)上的Ni，一些催化剂还进一步添加了少量的Pt进行改性。

这项反应器研究的主要发现包括：

1. 使用单金属Ni/ACC催化剂时，20 wt% Ni负载量下的最大氢气产生速率为8.5 mmol g⁻¹cat min⁻¹。

2. 向Ni基催化剂中添加少量Pt（0.5 wt%）产生了协同效应，与20 wt% 单Ni催化剂相比，氢气产量提高了约1.5倍。

3. 20 wt% Ni-0.5 wt% Pt双金属催化剂的氢气产生速率比0.5 wt%单金属Pt催化剂高约60倍。

4. 向Ni/ACC催化剂中添加Pt提高了脱氢反应的选择性。

这些发现表明反应器研究如何contributes to 我们对选择性脱氢过程的理解，特别是在优化催化剂组成以改善氢气生产和储存应用性能方面。

然而，这份文献并未提供关于UHV研究或使用的具体表征技术的信息。它也没有涉及N-H键脱氢或讨论广泛的反应条件。要全面回答这个问题，还需要有关UHV研究、表征技术和更广泛的脱氢反应的其他文献。
