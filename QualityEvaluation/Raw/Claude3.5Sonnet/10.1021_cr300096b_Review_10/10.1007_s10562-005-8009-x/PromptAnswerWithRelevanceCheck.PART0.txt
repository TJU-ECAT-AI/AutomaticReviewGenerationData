The provided literature focuses on a specific case of selective dehydrogenation, namely the dehydrogenation of cyclohexane to benzene, which is relevant to hydrogen storage and supply systems. This study demonstrates the significance of selective dehydrogenation reactions in hydrogen storage applications.

The research method employed in this study involves using a spray-pulsed mode reactor to investigate hydrogen evolution from cyclohexane dehydrogenation. The catalysts used are Ni supported on activated carbon cloth (ACC), with some catalysts further promoted by a small amount of Pt.

Key findings from this reactor study include:

1. The maximum rate of hydrogen evolution using monometallic Ni/ACC catalysts was 8.5 mmol g⁻¹cat min⁻¹ for 20 wt% Ni loading.

2. Addition of a small amount of Pt (0.5 wt%) to Ni-based catalysts resulted in a synergistic effect, enhancing hydrogen production by about 1.5 times compared to the 20 wt% Ni-only catalyst.

3. The 20 wt% Ni-0.5 wt% Pt bimetallic catalyst showed approximately 60 times higher hydrogen production rates compared to a 0.5 wt% monometallic Pt catalyst.

4. The addition of Pt to Ni/ACC catalysts enhanced selectivity towards dehydrogenation.

These findings demonstrate how reactor studies contribute to our understanding of selective dehydrogenation processes, particularly in optimizing catalyst composition for improved performance in hydrogen production and storage applications.

However, this literature does not provide information on UHV studies or specific characterization techniques used. It also does not cover N-H bond dehydrogenation or discuss a wide range of reaction conditions. To fully address the question, additional literature on UHV studies, characterization techniques, and a broader range of dehydrogenation reactions would be necessary.
