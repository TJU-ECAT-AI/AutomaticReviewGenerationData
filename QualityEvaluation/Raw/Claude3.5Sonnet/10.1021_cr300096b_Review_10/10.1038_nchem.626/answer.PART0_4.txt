[1] "The ammonia decomposition reaction has recently been subject to an increasing level of attention due to the possibility of ammonia being used as a hydrogen storage medium in a possible hydrogen economy."

[2] "Ammonia decomposition proceeds by means of dehydrogenation, followed by recombination of N and H to form N2 and H2, respectively."

[3] "TPD results following the desorption of hydrogen from the four surfaces as well as ammonia dosed at low temperatures are provided in the Supplementary Information."

[4] "HREELS was used to investigate the decomposition of ammonia on the NiPtPt surface. The HREELS results and the vibrational assignment of possible reaction intermediates are provided in the Supplementary Information."

The literature does not provide a comprehensive analysis of selective dehydrogenation reactions in chemical production, fuel synthesis, and hydrogen storage as requested in the question. However, it does focus on ammonia decomposition as a specific case of N-H bond dehydrogenation for hydrogen storage applications.

The study employs both computational methods (DFT calculations and microkinetic modeling) and experimental techniques (TPD and HREELS) to investigate ammonia decomposition on various catalytic surfaces. These methods contribute to understanding the process in the following ways:

1. Computational methods: DFT calculations and microkinetic modeling are used to predict catalytic activity based on nitrogen binding energies, allowing for the screening of potential catalysts.

2. Temperature Programmed Desorption (TPD): This UHV technique is used to study the decomposition of ammonia on different surfaces, providing information on reaction temperatures and product formation.

3. High-Resolution Electron Energy Loss Spectroscopy (HREELS): This technique is employed to investigate reaction intermediates during ammonia decomposition.

The study focuses on understanding the fundamental steps of ammonia decomposition, including N-H bond breaking and nitrogen recombination, under UHV conditions. While this provides valuable insights into the reaction mechanism, it's important to note that these conditions differ significantly from those in practical applications.

The research informs catalyst optimization by identifying key descriptors (such as nitrogen binding energy) that correlate with catalytic activity, and by demonstrating the potential of bimetallic catalysts to enhance performance compared to single-metal catalysts.

However, the study does not extensively cover C-H bond dehydrogenation or discuss a wide range of supported catalysts, limiting its direct applicability to other dehydrogenation processes in chemical production and fuel synthesis.

这篇文献并没有对化学生产、燃料合成和氢储存中的选择性脱氢反应进行全面分析,如问题所要求的那样。然而,它确实专注于氨分解作为一种特定的N-H键脱氢反应,用于氢储存应用。

该研究采用计算方法(DFT计算和微动力学建模)和实验技术(TPD和HREELS)来研究各种催化表面上的氨分解。这些方法通过以下方式有助于理解该过程:

1. 计算方法:使用DFT计算和微动力学建模基于氮结合能预测催化活性,从而筛选潜在的催化剂。

2. 程序升温脱附(TPD):这种超高真空技术用于研究不同表面上氨的分解,提供反应温度和产物形成的信息。

3. 高分辨电子能量损失谱(HREELS):这种技术用于研究氨分解过程中的反应中间体。

该研究着重于理解氨分解的基本步骤,包括在超高真空条件下的N-H键断裂和氮重组。虽然这为反应机理提供了宝贵的见解,但需要注意的是,这些条件与实际应用中的条件有显著差异。

该研究通过识别与催化活性相关的关键描述符(如氮结合能),以及展示双金属催化剂相比单金属催化剂提高性能的潜力,为催化剂优化提供了信息。

然而,该研究并未广泛涵盖C-H键脱氢或讨论广泛的负载型催化剂,限制了其对化学生产和燃料合成中其他脱氢过程的直接适用性。
