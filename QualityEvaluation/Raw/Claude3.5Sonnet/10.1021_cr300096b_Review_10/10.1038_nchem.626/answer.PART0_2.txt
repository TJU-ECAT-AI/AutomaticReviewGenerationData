[1] "The ammonia decomposition reaction has recently been subject to an increasing level of attention due to the possibility of ammonia being used as a hydrogen storage medium in a possible hydrogen economy."

[2] "Ammonia decomposition proceeds by means of dehydrogenation, followed by recombination of N and H to form N2 and H2, respectively."

[3] "TPD results following the desorption of hydrogen from the four surfaces as well as ammonia dosed at low temperatures are provided in the Supplementary Information."

[4] "HREELS was used to investigate the decomposition of ammonia on the NiPtPt surface. The HREELS results and the vibrational assignment of possible reaction intermediates are provided in the Supplementary Information."

The literature does not provide a comprehensive analysis of selective dehydrogenation reactions in chemical production, fuel synthesis, and hydrogen storage as requested in the question. However, it does offer some insights into ammonia decomposition as a potential hydrogen storage method, which involves N-H bond dehydrogenation.

The study primarily focuses on ammonia decomposition using both computational methods (DFT calculations and microkinetic modeling) and experimental techniques (TPD and HREELS) under UHV conditions. These methods are used to investigate the catalytic activity of various monometallic and bimetallic surfaces for ammonia decomposition.

Key research methods include:
1. DFT calculations to predict binding energies and catalytic activity
2. Microkinetic modeling to simulate reactor conditions
3. Temperature Programmed Desorption (TPD) to study desorption of reaction products
4. High-Resolution Electron Energy Loss Spectroscopy (HREELS) to identify surface intermediates

The study investigates reaction conditions such as temperature, surface composition, and adsorbate coverage. It focuses on optimizing catalytic activity by identifying surfaces with optimal nitrogen binding energies.

While this research provides valuable insights into ammonia decomposition for hydrogen storage, it does not extensively cover other selective dehydrogenation reactions or compare reactor studies to UHV studies. The study demonstrates how combining computational predictions with experimental validation can inform catalyst design and optimization for specific chemical processes.

文献并未提供关于化学生产、燃料合成和氢气储存中选择性脱氢反应的全面分析，正如问题所要求的那样。然而，它确实提供了一些关于氨分解作为潜在氢气储存方法的见解，这涉及N-H键的脱氢。

该研究主要关注氨分解，使用计算方法（DFT计算和微动力学建模）和实验技术（TPD和HREELS）在超高真空条件下进行。这些方法用于研究各种单金属和双金属表面对氨分解的催化活性。

主要研究方法包括：
1. DFT计算，用于预测结合能和催化活性
2. 微动力学建模，用于模拟反应器条件
3. 程序升温脱附（TPD），用于研究反应产物的脱附
4. 高分辨电子能量损失谱（HREELS），用于识别表面中间体

该研究调查了温度、表面组成和吸附剂覆盖率等反应条件。它侧重于通过识别具有最佳氮结合能的表面来优化催化活性。

虽然这项研究为氢气储存的氨分解提供了宝贵的见解，但它并未广泛涵盖其他选择性脱氢反应，也没有比较反应器研究和超高真空研究。该研究展示了如何将计算预测与实验验证相结合，以指导特定化学过程的催化剂设计和优化。
