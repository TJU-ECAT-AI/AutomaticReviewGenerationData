          [1] "The ammonia decomposition reaction has recently been subject to an increasing level of attention due to the possibility of ammonia being used as a hydrogen storage medium in a possible hydrogen economy."

[2] "Ammonia decomposition proceeds by means of dehydrogenation, followed by recombination of N and H to form N2 and H2, respectively."

[3] "A sensitivity analysis performed on each of the surfaces shows the rate-determining step to be the removal of the second hydrogen (from the NH2; reaction R5) for surfaces with a nitrogen binding energy less than 125 kcal mol1."

[4] "TPD results following the desorption of hydrogen from the four surfaces as well as ammonia dosed at low temperatures are provided in the Supplementary Information."

[5] "HREELS was used to investigate the decomposition of ammonia on the NiPtPt surface. The HREELS results and the vibrational assignment of possible reaction intermediates are provided in the Supplementary Information."

[6] "Our experimental findings support the proposed computational framework in which potential (complex) bimetallic catalysts can effectively be screened using a library of binding energies of bimetallic catalysts from DFT calculations guided from full, first-principles-based microkinetic models."

[7] "The binding energy of the nitrogen atom to the surface must be strong enough for dehydrogenation of the NHx species to occur, but sufficiently weak that the nitrogen recombines to desorb from the surface to complete the catalytic cycle."

          The literature primarily focuses on ammonia decomposition for hydrogen storage, which is a specific case of N-H bond dehydrogenation. While this doesn't cover the full scope of selective dehydrogenation reactions in chemical production and fuel synthesis, it provides valuable insights into the significance and study methods of dehydrogenation processes:

1. Significance: Ammonia decomposition is crucial for hydrogen storage in a potential hydrogen economy, highlighting the importance of selective dehydrogenation in energy applications.

2. Research methods and characterization techniques:
   - Computational methods: DFT calculations and microkinetic modeling for predicting catalytic activity and screening potential catalysts.
   - Experimental techniques: 
     a) Temperature Programmed Desorption (TPD) for studying product desorption and reaction temperatures.
     b) High-Resolution Electron Energy Loss Spectroscopy (HREELS) for investigating reaction intermediates.

3. Reaction conditions: The study examines ammonia decomposition under Ultra-High Vacuum (UHV) conditions at various temperatures, typically ranging from 150K to 850K.

4. Key findings:
   - The rate-determining step is identified as the removal of the second hydrogen from NH2 for certain surfaces.
   - Nitrogen binding energy is found to be a crucial descriptor for catalytic activity.
   - Bimetallic catalysts (e.g., NiPtPt) show promising activity compared to traditional catalysts.

5. Catalyst optimization: The study demonstrates a method for screening bimetallic catalysts based on binding energies, which could be applied to optimize catalysts for other dehydrogenation reactions.

6. Reactor vs. UHV studies: While the study primarily uses UHV techniques, it also employs microkinetic modeling to simulate reactor conditions, bridging the gap between fundamental surface science and practical applications.

This research provides a framework for studying selective dehydrogenation reactions, combining theoretical predictions with experimental validation. While focused on N-H bond dehydrogenation, similar approaches could be applied to investigate C-H bond dehydrogenation in other chemical production and fuel synthesis applications.
