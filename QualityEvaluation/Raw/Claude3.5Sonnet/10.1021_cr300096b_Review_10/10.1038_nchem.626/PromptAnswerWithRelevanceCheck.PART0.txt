[1] "The ammonia decomposition reaction has recently been subject to an increasing level of attention due to the possibility of ammonia being used as a hydrogen storage medium in a possible hydrogen economy."

[2] "Ammonia decomposition proceeds by means of dehydrogenation, followed by recombination of N and H to form N2 and H2, respectively."

[3] "A sensitivity analysis performed on each of the surfaces shows the rate-determining step to be the removal of the second hydrogen (from the NH2; reaction R5) for surfaces with a nitrogen binding energy less than 125 kcal mol1."

[4] "TPD results following the desorption of hydrogen from the four surfaces as well as ammonia dosed at low temperatures are provided in the Supplementary Information."

[5] "Our experimental findings support the proposed computational framework in which potential (complex) bimetallic catalysts can effectively be screened using a library of binding energies of bimetallic catalysts from DFT calculations guided from full, first-principles-based microkinetic models."

This literature focuses primarily on ammonia decomposition for hydrogen storage rather than broader selective dehydrogenation processes. However, it provides insights into studying dehydrogenation reactions that can be applied more broadly:

1. Research methods: The study combines computational modeling (DFT calculations, microkinetic modeling) with experimental techniques (TPD, HREELS) to investigate catalytic activity.

2. Characterization techniques: Temperature-programmed desorption (TPD) and high-resolution electron energy loss spectroscopy (HREELS) are used to study surface reactions and intermediates.

3. Reaction conditions: The study examines ammonia decomposition under UHV conditions at various temperatures, typically ranging from 150K to 850K.

4. Key findings: The rate-determining step is identified as the removal of the second hydrogen from NH2. Nitrogen binding energy is found to be a good descriptor for catalytic activity.

5. Catalyst optimization: The study demonstrates a method for screening bimetallic catalysts based on binding energies, which could be applied to optimize catalysts for other dehydrogenation reactions.

While this study focuses on N-H bond dehydrogenation, similar approaches could be used to investigate C-H bond dehydrogenation in other chemical production and fuel synthesis applications. The combination of computational screening and experimental validation provides a powerful framework for understanding and optimizing catalytic processes in selective dehydrogenation reactions.

The literature does not provide a comprehensive analysis of selective dehydrogenation reactions in chemical production, fuel synthesis, and hydrogen storage as requested in the question. However, it does focus on ammonia decomposition as a specific case of N-H bond dehydrogenation for hydrogen storage applications.

The study employs both computational methods (DFT calculations and microkinetic modeling) and experimental techniques (TPD and HREELS) to investigate ammonia decomposition on various catalytic surfaces. These methods contribute to understanding the process in the following ways:

1. Computational methods: DFT calculations and microkinetic modeling are used to predict catalytic activity based on nitrogen binding energies, allowing for the screening of potential catalysts.

2. Temperature Programmed Desorption (TPD): This UHV technique is used to study the decomposition of ammonia on different surfaces, providing information on reaction temperatures and product formation.

3. High-Resolution Electron Energy Loss Spectroscopy (HREELS): This technique is employed to investigate reaction intermediates during ammonia decomposition.

The study focuses on understanding the fundamental steps of ammonia decomposition, including N-H bond breaking and nitrogen recombination, under UHV conditions. While this provides valuable insights into the reaction mechanism, it's important to note that these conditions differ significantly from those in practical applications.

The research informs catalyst optimization by identifying key descriptors (such as nitrogen binding energy) that correlate with catalytic activity, and by demonstrating the potential of bimetallic catalysts to enhance performance compared to single-metal catalysts.

However, the study does not extensively cover C-H bond dehydrogenation or discuss a wide range of supported catalysts, limiting its direct applicability to other dehydrogenation processes in chemical production and fuel synthesis.
