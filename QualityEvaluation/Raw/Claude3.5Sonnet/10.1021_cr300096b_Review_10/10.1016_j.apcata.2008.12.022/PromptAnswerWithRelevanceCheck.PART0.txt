[1] "As industrial demand for propylene grows, its production via dehydrogenation (DH) of propane is assuming greater importance."

[2] "DH of propane is highly endothermic and therefore requires high reaction temperatures (around 600 8C). As a consequence of these high reaction temperatures, the process suffers from poor economy and rapid catalyst deactivation due to coke formation."

[3] "Pt-Sn catalysts are known for their high selectivity and stability in the propane DH reaction; they should therefore be able to catalyze both DH and SHC reactions."

[4] "Particular emphasis was placed on the ability of the catalyst to achieve a conversion higher than that of equilibrium for normal DH. The feasibility of the DH process combined with SHC was examined."

[5] "CO adsorption measurements were conducted at 25 8C to determine the number of surface Pt atoms based on the assumption that the ratio of adsorbed CO molecules and surface platinum atoms equals 1."

[6] "RAD-B system (Rigaku Corporation) and FT/IR350 (JASCO Corporation) were employed for X-Ray Diffraction (XRD) measurements and Fourier-Transformed Infrared (FT-IR) measurements of adsorbed carbon monoxide."

Selective dehydrogenation reactions are of significant importance in chemical production, particularly in the production of propylene from propane. The literature highlights the growing industrial demand for propylene and the increasing importance of propane dehydrogenation (DH) in meeting this demand.

Reactor studies contribute substantially to our understanding of these processes. The literature describes experiments conducted in fixed-bed flow reactors under various conditions to study propane dehydrogenation and selective hydrogen combustion (SHC). These studies allow researchers to evaluate catalyst performance, reaction kinetics, and process feasibility under conditions closer to industrial applications.

Key research methods include:
1. Catalyst preparation and optimization
2. Catalytic activity testing under various reaction conditions
3. Investigation of the effects of additives (e.g., Sn, Zn) on catalyst performance

Characterization techniques mentioned in the literature include:
1. CO adsorption measurements to determine the number of surface Pt atoms
2. BET surface area measurements
3. X-Ray Diffraction (XRD) for phase identification
4. Fourier-Transformed Infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy for studying adsorbed species

Typical reaction conditions investigated include:
1. High temperatures (around 600°C for propane DH)
2. Various feed compositions and ratios
3. Different contact times

These studies inform catalyst optimization by revealing the effects of additives, support materials, and reaction conditions on catalyst performance, selectivity, and stability. For example, the literature discusses how Sn and Zn additions to Pt catalysts improve selectivity and stability in propane dehydrogenation.

While the literature does not explicitly mention UHV studies or N-H bond dehydrogenation, the research methods and characterization techniques described are broadly applicable to studying various selective dehydrogenation reactions, including C-H and potentially N-H bond dehydrogenation over supported catalysts.

This study focuses on propane dehydrogenation (DH) combined with selective hydrogen combustion (SHC) over supported Pt-Sn bimetallic catalysts, rather than C-H and N-H bond dehydrogenation specifically. However, some insights can be drawn about selective dehydrogenation reactions in general:

1. Significance: Selective dehydrogenation is important for shifting reaction equilibrium towards desired products. In this case, SHC shifts the equilibrium of propane DH towards higher propylene yield.

2. Reactor studies: Fixed bed flow reactors were used to investigate normal propane DH and DH combined with SHC. These studies examined catalytic activity, selectivity, and stability under various reaction conditions.

3. Characterization techniques: CO adsorption measurements, BET surface area analysis, XRD, and FT-IR of adsorbed CO were used to characterize the catalysts. These techniques provide information about surface properties, metal dispersion, and catalyst structure.

4. Reaction conditions: Temperature (500°C), feed composition, and contact time were key variables investigated. Optimizing these conditions is crucial for maximizing conversion and selectivity.

5. Catalyst optimization: The study focused on optimizing Pt-Sn bimetallic catalysts by varying Sn loading and support material. This demonstrates the importance of catalyst composition in improving selectivity and stability.

While this study does not directly address UHV studies or C-H/N-H bond dehydrogenation, it illustrates how reactor studies and characterization techniques contribute to understanding and optimizing selective dehydrogenation processes. The methods and approaches used here could be applied to other dehydrogenation reactions, including those relevant to fuel synthesis and hydrogen storage.
