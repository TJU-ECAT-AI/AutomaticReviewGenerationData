[1] "As industrial demand for propylene grows, its production via dehydrogenation (DH) of propane is assuming greater importance."

[2] "DH of propane is highly endothermic and therefore requires high reaction temperatures (around 600 8C). As a consequence of these high reaction temperatures, the process suffers from poor economy and rapid catalyst deactivation due to coke formation."

[3] "Pt-Sn catalysts are known for their high selectivity and stability in the propane DH reaction; they should therefore be able to catalyze both DH and SHC reactions."

[4] "Particular emphasis was placed on the ability of the catalyst to achieve a conversion higher than that of equilibrium for normal DH. The feasibility of the DH process combined with SHC was examined."

[5] "CO adsorption measurements were conducted at 25 8C to determine the number of surface Pt atoms based on the assumption that the ratio of adsorbed CO molecules and surface platinum atoms equals 1."

[6] "RAD-B system (Rigaku Corporation) and FT/IR350 (JASCO Corporation) were employed for X-Ray Diffraction (XRD) measurements and Fourier-Transformed Infrared (FT-IR) measurements of adsorbed carbon monoxide."

Selective dehydrogenation reactions are of significant importance in chemical production, particularly in the production of propylene from propane. The literature highlights the growing industrial demand for propylene and the increasing importance of propane dehydrogenation (DH) in meeting this demand.

Reactor studies contribute substantially to our understanding of these processes. The literature describes experiments conducted in fixed-bed flow reactors under various conditions to study propane dehydrogenation and selective hydrogen combustion (SHC). These studies allow researchers to evaluate catalyst performance, reaction kinetics, and process feasibility under conditions closer to industrial applications.

Key research methods include:
1. Catalyst preparation and optimization
2. Catalytic activity testing under various reaction conditions
3. Investigation of the effects of additives (e.g., Sn, Zn) on catalyst performance

Characterization techniques mentioned in the literature include:
1. CO adsorption measurements to determine the number of surface Pt atoms
2. BET surface area measurements
3. X-Ray Diffraction (XRD) for phase identification
4. Fourier-Transformed Infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy for studying adsorbed species

Typical reaction conditions investigated include:
1. High temperatures (around 600°C for propane DH)
2. Various feed compositions and ratios
3. Different contact times

These studies inform catalyst optimization by revealing the effects of additives, support materials, and reaction conditions on catalyst performance, selectivity, and stability. For example, the literature discusses how Sn and Zn additions to Pt catalysts improve selectivity and stability in propane dehydrogenation.

While the literature does not explicitly mention UHV studies or N-H bond dehydrogenation, the research methods and characterization techniques described are broadly applicable to studying various selective dehydrogenation reactions, including C-H and potentially N-H bond dehydrogenation over supported catalysts.
