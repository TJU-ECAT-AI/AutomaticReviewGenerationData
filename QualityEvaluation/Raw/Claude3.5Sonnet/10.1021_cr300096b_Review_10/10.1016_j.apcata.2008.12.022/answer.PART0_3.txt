[1] "DH of propane (1) has been carried out in the presence of inert gas, hydrogen or steam (normal dehydrogenation) [1,2]."

[2] "As an alternative to ODH, a new method based on a combination of DH with selective hydrogen combustion (SHC) has been proposed. The reaction equilibrium can be shifted toward the desired products by selective combustion of hydrogen formed via DH."

[3] "The most challenging aspect is the selective combustion of hydrogen in the presence of propane and propylene, which are both easily combustible."

[4] "Pt-Sn catalysts are known for their high selectivity and stability in the propane DH reaction; they should therefore be able to catalyze both DH and SHC reactions."

[5] "CO adsorption measurements were conducted at 25 8C to determine the number of surface Pt atoms based on the assumption that the ratio of adsorbed CO molecules and surface platinum atoms equals 1."

[6] "RAD-B system (Rigaku Corporation) and FT/IR350 (JASCO Corporation) were employed for X-Ray Diffraction (XRD) measurements and Fourier-Transformed Infrared (FT-IR) measurements of adsorbed carbon monoxide."

The literature discusses selective dehydrogenation reactions, particularly focusing on propane dehydrogenation (DH) combined with selective hydrogen combustion (SHC). This process is significant for chemical production, as it aims to improve propylene yield by overcoming thermodynamic limitations.

Reactor studies contribute to understanding these processes by:

1. Evaluating catalyst performance under realistic conditions
2. Optimizing reaction parameters like temperature and feed composition
3. Assessing catalyst stability and selectivity over time

Key research methods include:

1. Fixed-bed flow reactor experiments
2. Gas chromatography for product analysis
3. Thermodynamic equilibrium calculations

Characterization techniques mentioned include:

1. CO adsorption measurements
2. BET surface area analysis
3. X-Ray Diffraction (XRD)
4. Fourier-Transformed Infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy

The study focuses on supported Pt-Sn catalysts, investigating the effects of additives like Zn and varying Sn loadings. Reaction conditions typically investigated include temperature, contact time, and O2/H2 feed ratio.

These studies inform catalyst optimization by:

1. Identifying optimal catalyst compositions (e.g., Pt-Sn ratio)
2. Understanding the role of support materials
3. Elucidating reaction mechanisms and the ensemble effect in bimetallic catalysts

While the document does not explicitly discuss UHV studies or N-H bond dehydrogenation, it demonstrates how reactor studies contribute to developing more efficient catalytic processes for selective dehydrogenation reactions.
