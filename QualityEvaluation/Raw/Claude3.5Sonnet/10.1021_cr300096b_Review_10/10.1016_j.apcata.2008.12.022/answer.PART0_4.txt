[1] "DH of propane (1) has been carried out in the presence of inert gas, hydrogen or steam (normal dehydrogenation) [1,2]."

[2] "As an alternative to ODH, a new method based on a combination of DH with selective hydrogen combustion (SHC) has been proposed. The reaction equilibrium can be shifted toward the desired products by selective combustion of hydrogen formed via DH."

[3] "Pt-Sn catalysts are known for their high selectivity and stability in the propane DH reaction; they should therefore be able to catalyze both DH and SHC reactions."

[4] "CO adsorption measurements were conducted at 25 °C to determine the number of surface Pt atoms based on the assumption that the ratio of adsorbed CO molecules and surface platinum atoms equals 1."

[5] "Additionally, RAD-B system (Rigaku Corporation) and FT/IR350 (JASCO Corporation) were employed for X-Ray Diffraction (XRD) measurements and Fourier-Transformed Infrared (FT-IR) measurements of adsorbed carbon monoxide."

This study focuses on propane dehydrogenation (DH) combined with selective hydrogen combustion (SHC) over supported Pt-Sn bimetallic catalysts, rather than C-H and N-H bond dehydrogenation specifically. However, some insights can be drawn about selective dehydrogenation reactions in general:

1. Significance: Selective dehydrogenation is important for shifting reaction equilibrium towards desired products. In this case, SHC shifts the equilibrium of propane DH towards higher propylene yield.

2. Reactor studies: Fixed bed flow reactors were used to investigate normal propane DH and DH combined with SHC. These studies examined catalytic activity, selectivity, and stability under various reaction conditions.

3. Characterization techniques: CO adsorption measurements, BET surface area analysis, XRD, and FT-IR of adsorbed CO were used to characterize the catalysts. These techniques provide information about surface properties, metal dispersion, and catalyst structure.

4. Reaction conditions: Temperature (500°C), feed composition, and contact time were key variables investigated. Optimizing these conditions is crucial for maximizing conversion and selectivity.

5. Catalyst optimization: The study focused on optimizing Pt-Sn bimetallic catalysts by varying Sn loading and support material. This demonstrates the importance of catalyst composition in improving selectivity and stability.

While this study does not directly address UHV studies or C-H/N-H bond dehydrogenation, it illustrates how reactor studies and characterization techniques contribute to understanding and optimizing selective dehydrogenation processes. The methods and approaches used here could be applied to other dehydrogenation reactions, including those relevant to fuel synthesis and hydrogen storage.

这项研究主要关注于负载型Pt-Sn双金属催化剂上丙烷脱氢(DH)与选择性氢燃烧(SHC)的结合,而不是专门研究C-H和N-H键的脱氢。然而,我们可以从中获得一些关于选择性脱氢反应的普遍见解:

1. 重要性:选择性脱氢对于将反应平衡向所需产物方向移动很重要。在这种情况下,SHC将丙烷DH的平衡向更高的丙烯产率方向移动。

2. 反应器研究:使用固定床流动反应器研究正常丙烷DH和结合SHC的DH。这些研究在各种反应条件下考察了催化活性、选择性和稳定性。

3. 表征技术:使用CO吸附测量、BET比表面积分析、XRD和吸附CO的FT-IR来表征催化剂。这些技术提供了关于表面性质、金属分散度和催化剂结构的信息。

4. 反应条件:温度(500°C)、进料组成和接触时间是研究的关键变量。优化这些条件对于最大化转化率和选择性至关重要。

5. 催化剂优化:研究重点是通过改变Sn负载量和载体材料来优化Pt-Sn双金属催化剂。这表明催化剂组成对提高选择性和稳定性很重要。

虽然这项研究没有直接涉及UHV研究或C-H/N-H键脱氢,但它说明了反应器研究和表征技术如何有助于理解和优化选择性脱氢过程。这里使用的方法和方式可以应用于其他脱氢反应,包括与燃料合成和氢储存相关的反应。
