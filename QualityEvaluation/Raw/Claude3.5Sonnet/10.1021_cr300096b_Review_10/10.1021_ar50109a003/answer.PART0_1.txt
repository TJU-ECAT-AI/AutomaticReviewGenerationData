Unfortunately, this scientific literature does not contain any relevant quotes to answer the specific question about selective dehydrogenation reactions, reactor studies, and UHV studies. The document appears to be about bimetallic catalysts and alloys in general, but does not discuss the particular topics mentioned in the question.

This document does not contain information specifically related to selective dehydrogenation reactions, reactor studies, or UHV studies of C-H and N-H bond dehydrogenation over supported catalysts. The text appears to be a general overview of bimetallic catalysts and alloys, but does not discuss the particular topics, research methods, characterization techniques, or reaction conditions mentioned in the question. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer based on the given literature.

这份文献并不包含与选择性脱氢反应、反应器研究或支持催化剂上C-H和N-H键脱氢的超高真空(UHV)研究相关的具体信息。文本似乎是对双金属催化剂和合金的一般性概述，但没有讨论问题中提到的特定主题、研究方法、表征技术或反应条件。因此，我无法根据给定的文献提供答案。
