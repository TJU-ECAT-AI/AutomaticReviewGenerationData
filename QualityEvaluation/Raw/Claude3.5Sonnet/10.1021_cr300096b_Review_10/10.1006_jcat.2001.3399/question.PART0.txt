The influence of pretreatment temperature on the metal func-
tion of a commercial Pt-Re/Al2O3 reforming catalyst was studied
by X-ray absorption spectroscopy. By simultaneously examining
the rhenium LIII and platinum LIII EXAFS data, the bimetal-
lic interaction and the metal-support interaction can be distin-
guished from the overall spectrum. The results show that if the
catalyst is dried in air at temperatures 500C before reduction at
480C, bimetallic particles of platinum and rhenium are formed.
Drying at higher temperatures and in absence of air inhibits the
transport of mobile (rhenium) species on the surface causing no
intimate contact between the two metals. Platinum LIII EXAFS
data show that the average particle size of the bimetallic parti-
cles on the alumina surface is less than 10 
A. The results from the
rhenium LIII EXAFS analysis confirm that rhenium is not com-
pletely reduced to metallic rhenium after reduction, with a sig-
nificant fraction of the rhenium present in low, positive oxidation
states and in intimate contact with the support. The EXAFS data
are consistent with a structural model of rhenium metal particles
13 nm wide with smaller platinum particles situated within or at
the boundary of the rhenium particles, and that moderate heat-
ing in presence of air (i.e., moist) provides the best conditions for
transport of mobile rhenium species on the surface, and hence alloy
formation.

INTRODUCTION
The catalytic reforming of naphtha is usually performed
using a bifunctional catalyst containing both a hydro-
genating metal and an acid function. The metal function
is platinum together with another component such as
rhenium, tin, iridium, or germanium. Chlorine-promoted
alumina with high surface area provides the acid function.
It has been demonstrated that the addition of rhenium

to Pt/Al2O3 leads to a catalyst with greater stability and
improved selectivity (1). However, the structure and exact
role of rhenium in platinum-rhenium catalysts have been
a matter of controversy. It has been proposed that metallic
rhenium provides sites for hydrogenolysis of coke deposits
(2) and that rhenium acts independently of platinum and is
able to convert coke precursors into harmless products (3).
Others state that rhenium anchors platinum to the alumina
support and thereby stabilises the platinum dispersion (4).
The structure-insensitive conversion of methylcyclohexane
(MCH) has been used as a measure of the platinum dis-
persion in the catalysts.
The most common explanation of the properties of the
catalyst is based on PtRe alloy formation (5) and the in-
teraction of such an alloy with sulphur (69). It has been
shown that the hydrogenolysis activity over bimetallic cata-
lysts is significantly higher than over its monometallic coun-
terparts (5, 10, 11) and also higher than for physical mix-
tures of Pt/Al2O3 and Re/Al2O3 (12). Hydrogenolysis is a
structure-sensitive reaction and has therefore been used as
a probe reaction to determine PtRe alloy formation. In
addition, TPR-studies (1315) have indicated possible re-
duction mechanisms leading to the formation of bimetallic
PtRe metal particles. Previous studies indicate that the
treatment of the catalyst prior to reduction strongly mod-
ifies the reducibility of rhenium and the extent of PtRe
alloy formation (1619). Varying degrees of alloy forma-
tion have been confirmed by both hydrogenolysis activity
measurements and hydrogen chemisorption experiments
(17). More direct evidence of alloy formation from phys-
ical characterisation techniques such as IR and XPS has
been difficult to obtain due to the low metal loading and
high metal dispersion in the PtRe reforming catalysts.
Studies using EDX and TEM (20, 21) conclude that no
rhenium can be detected in the platinum particles in the
bimetallic system after reduction at 400C, although the
yields from reforming experiments indicate that a signifi-
cant fraction of the rhenium must be present in the metallic

state. However, in a recent study (18) a high-resolution
combined STEM and EDX instrument were able to
detect bimetallic PtRe particles. It was established that
bimetallic interaction in PtRe/Al2O3 catalysts is highly
dependent on the pretreatment conditions. The highest
degree of PtRe interaction was found when the catalyst
was not dehydrated prior to reduction, while drying in N2
at high temperatures before reduction causes sintering of
platinum particles and low bimetallic interaction.
X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) is a powerful tech-
nique for obtaining detailed information about the metal
containing species in highly dispersed systems lacking long-
range order. Several XAS studies on PtRe/Al2O3 have
been reported dealing with different aspects concerning the
metal function of the catalyst system. Recent studies have
made use of TPR and binding energies from the XAS spec-
tra to establish the correlation between calcination temper-
atures and bimetallic interaction (22). It is reported that
rhenium is completely reducible to metallic rhenium if the
samples are calcined at low temperatures and that the re-
duction step involves a rhenium intermediate with oxida-
tion state close to +I (23) leading to complete alloying of
platinum and rhenium. Michel et al. (24) found that the
metal loadings and the Re/Pt ratio affect the reduction
kinetics of rhenium but do not affect the final oxidation
state of rhenium, and that even if the catalyst precursor
is dried, all of the rhenium is coreduced with platinum at
low temperatures when the catalyst contains ca. 1 wt%
chlorine.
Fung et al. (25) used EXAFS to characterise PtRe clus-
ters supported on γ -Al2O3 prepared from [Re2Pt(CO)12],
demonstrating that by using k0 weighting (k being the wave
vector) contributions from metal-support interactions and
bimetallic interaction (PtRe) may be distinguished in the
EXAFS data analysis. They conclude that the catalyst re-
duced at 400C in H2 contained a considerable fraction of
bimetallic particles consisting of Re4Pt2 entities and dis-
playinghighdispersion(averageparticlesizelessthan10

and strong interaction between rhenium atoms and the sup-
port. For further details, we refer to Xiao and Puddephatt
(26), who have published a comprehensive review on the
structure and reactivity of PtRe clusters.
There are several experimental obstacles associated
with XAS data collection on this catalyst system, with
the most important being low metal loading. Samples
with metal loadings as low as 0.3 wt% require the spectra
to be recorded in the fluorescence mode rather than
the transmission mode. Furthermore, interference from
overlapping EXAFS regions excludes part of the EXAFS
region associated with the platinum LIII and LII absorption
edges (27). Accordingly, one can either choose to use
the limited EXAFS region associated with the platinum
LIII and LII edge or use the EXAFS associated with the
platinum LI edge, which is not affected by intervening
rhenium edges but exhibits a considerably weaker signal
compared to the LIII edge. By comparing preliminary data
for all three platinum L edges, data associated with the
platinum LIII adsorption edge (11,565 eV) were found to be
most suitable for this EXAFS study. Due to the similarity
in backscattering properties for the two noble metals
involved, simultaneous investigations of data taken from
representative reference systems and the use of both k0 and
k3 weighting schemes are important for the deconvolution
of contributions from the different backscatterers (25). We
report here an examination of samples from four different
pretreatment procedures by the use of X-ray absorption
spectroscopy.
EXPERIMENTAL
Catalyst Pretreatment Procedure
The standard EUROPT-4 commercial catalyst (CK433)
containing 0.3 wt% platinum and 0.3 wt% rhenium sup-
ported on γ -Al2O3 was manufactured by Akzo, Holland.
The chlorine loading was 0.95 wt%. The precalcined
EUROPT-4 catalyst extrudates were finely grounded and
sieved to give a particle size fraction of 0.250.075 mm.
In order to use the allocated beam time at the ESRF
and Brookhaven laboratories as efficiently as possible the
samples were dried and reduced ex situ in our home labo-
ratory. After reduction, the samples were sealed in quartz
capillary tubes as described below to prevent exposure to
air. This procedure avoids time-consuming in situ pretreat-
ment at the synchrotron facility. In order to verify that the
sealing procedure was successful, some of the samples were
reduced in situ using an environmental cell developed by
Lytle et al. (28).
Pretreatment was carried out in a standard apparatus
equipped with Alltech molsieves and O2-traps for gas puri-
fication. Steady gas flows (30 ml/min) were maintained by
using mass-flow controllers. The catalyst was placed on a
quartz sinter inside a tubular flow-through quartz micro-
reactor with quartz capillary tubes (from Glas Technik &
Konstruktion, Germany) with outer diameter 23 mm and
wall thickness of 0.02 mm attached to the reactor wall. The
sample was heated to the desired temperatures using a fur-
nace equipped with a temperature controller. Four differ-
ent drying conditions prior to reduction at 480C for 1 h
using a heating rate of 0.8C/min were examined. One sam-
ple labelled PR-0 was reduced directly without any drying.
A second sample labelled PR-240/air was dried in air at
240C for 16 h before reduction. Another sample labelled
PR-500/air was dried in air at 500C for 16 h before re-
duction. The sample labelled PR-680/N2 was dried in dry
N2 at 680C for 16 h before reduction. After the reduc-
tion was finished the reactor was flushed with helium for
30 min and cooled down to room temperature. The reactor
was sealed off at both ends using stainless steel valves and
turned upside down to allow the powdered sample to enter

the capillary tubes. Using a relatively narrow sieve fraction
of the catalyst powder (0.250.075 mm), easy filling and
uniform distribution of the sample inside the capillary tube
are ensured. The quartz tube containing the sample was
sealed using a high-temperature gas flame, and detached
from the reactor. The inert atmosphere inside the reactor
and the relatively high flame temperature (>1200C due to
the high melting point for quartz) prevented oxidation of
the catalyst PR-500/air inside the capillary tube. In order
to reduce heat transfer to the sample in the capillary, the
length of sample material was such that 23 cm of empty
capillary separated the sample from the flame. A summary
of the samples involved and their characteristics are given
in Table 1. The volumetric hydrogen chemisorption mea-
surements were performed in a Micromeretics ASAP 2010
instrument at 25C.
XAS Measurements
XAS data were collected using the facilities of the
Swiss-Norwegian Beamline (SNBL) at the European Syn-
chrotron Radiation Facility (ESRF), France and at Beam-
line Station X11-A at the National Synchrotron Light
Source (NSLS), Brookhaven National Laboratory. All
spectra were collected at room temperature.
At SNBL, spectra were obtained on station EH1 at the
platinum LIII edge (11,564 eV) and the rhenium LIII edge
(10,535 eV). A channel-cut Si(111) monochromator with
an unfocussed beam was used to scan the X-ray spec-
tra. The beam currents ranged from 130 to 200 mA at
6.0 GeV. Higher order harmonics were rejected by means
of a chromium-coated mirror angled at 3.5 mrad to give
a cut-off energy of approximately 14 keV. The maximum
resolution (1E/E) of the Si(111) bandpass is 1.4 × 104
using a beam of size 0.6 × 7.2 mm as defined by the slits
in the station. Ion chamber detectors with their gases at
ambient temperature and pressure were used for measur-
ing the intensities of the incident (I0), transmitted (It), and
fluorescent (If) X rays. The detector gases were as follows:
I0, detector length 17 cm, 100% N2; It, length 31 cm, 35%
Ar, 65% N2; If (Lytle detector, see below), 100% Ar.
XAS data were also collected at Beamline Station X11-
A at Brookhaven National Synchrotron Light Source. The
station is equipped with a double crystal Si(111) monochro-
mator and the storage ring is operated at 2.5 GeV with a
ring current of 180350 mA. The beam size was defined to
be 0.5 × 10 mm and the resolution approximately 2.0 × 104
at the actual energies. Higher order harmonics were sup-
pressed by tuning the monochromator crystals to 50% of
maximum intensity.
The fluorescent radiation was collected using a detector
ofthetypedevelopedbyLytleetal.(28).Thesignal-to-noise
ratio was enhanced using a set of soller slits and Zn (3)
and Ga (3) filters for rhenium and platinum edges, respec-
tively. Due to the low metal loading, several scans were
taken and summed for each sample. The energy calibra-
tion was checked by measuring the spectrum of a platinum
foil (thickness 0.003 mm) and a rhenium foil (thickness
0.0125 mm) with the energy of the first inflection point be-
ing defined as the edge energy. The raw, unfiltered Re LIII
and Pt LIII EXAFS spectra of the four samples are shown
in Fig. 1.
EXAFS Data Analysis
The data were corrected for dark currents, converted to
k-space, and summed and the background was subtracted
to yield the EXAFS function χ(k) using the EXCALIB and
EXBACK programs (29). Model fitting was carried out with
EXCURV90 using curved-wave theory and ab initio phase
shifts (29, 30). During the least squares fitting it is important
to minimise correlation effects between the parameters that
strongly affect the EXAFS amplitude and those that influ-
ence the frequency of the EXAFS oscillations. Therefore,
the EXAFS spectra were least squares fitted in k space us-
ing k0 and k3 weighted data. By carrying out this procedure
on appropriate reference compounds as well as for the un-
known spectra, more accurate coordination numbers can
be obtained than what otherwise would be the case. The
errors in the refined parameters (3133) are estimated to
be 10% in coordination number (N), 1% in distance (R),
10% in DebyeWaller type factors (2σ 2), and 10% in the
photoelectron energy at zero wave vector (E0). As an indi-
cation on the quality of the fit, the residual index, Rχ(%) is

The k3 weighting scheme compensates for the diminishing
photoelectron wave at higher k values. Low k weighting
also enhances the contribution from lighter backscattering
atoms such as oxygen, and thereby allowing metal-support

to overlapping EXAFS regions for the platinum LIII and
rhenium LII edges, platinum LIII spectra have to be trun-
cated at approximately 9 
A1. Our approach to the data
analysis was similar to that used by Fung et al. (25). They
demonstrated that by analysing the XAFS data using k0
weighting, it is possible to distinguish PtRe from the PtPt
and ReRe interactions. The parameters obtained by Fung
et al. have been used as first guesses for the bimetallic in-
teractions due to the lack of suitable model compounds
for the PtRe and RePt scattering pairs. The preliminary
data analysis involved testing models that include contri-
butions from Pt, Re, and O scatterers for both platinum
and rhenium EXAFS data. Due to the narrow data range
