    "topic": "The significance, applications, and research methodologies of selective dehydrogenation reactions in chemical production, fuel synthesis, and hydrogen storage, with emphasis on C-H and N-H bond dehydrogenation over supported catalysts, as investigated through reactor and UHV studies.",
    "QuestionEnglish": "Analyze the significance of selective dehydrogenation reactions in chemical production, fuel synthesis, and hydrogen storage, and critically evaluate how reactor studies and UHV (Ultra-High Vacuum) studies contribute to our understanding of these processes, particularly focusing on C-H and N-H bond dehydrogenation over supported catalysts. In your discussion, address the key research methods, characterization techniques, and reaction conditions typically investigated, and explain how these studies inform the optimization of catalytic processes in this field.",
    "QuestionChinese": "分析选择性脱氢反应在化学品生产、燃料合成和氢储存中的重要性，并批判性地评估反应器研究和超高真空（UHV）研究如何有助于我们理解这些过程，特别是关注支撑催化剂上C-H和N-H键的脱氢反应。在讨论中，阐述通常研究的关键研究方法、表征技术和反应条件，并解释这些研究如何为该领域的催化过程优化提供信息。"
