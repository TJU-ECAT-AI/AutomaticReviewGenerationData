<EnglishVersionAnswer>

The given literature does not contain any information relevant to analyzing selective dehydrogenation reactions in chemical production, fuel synthesis, and hydrogen storage, or evaluating reactor and UHV studies of C-H and N-H bond dehydrogenation over supported catalysts. The document appears to focus on the roles of thrombin and protease-activated receptors in inflammation, which is unrelated to the topic of the question. Therefore, this question cannot be answered based on the provided literature.
