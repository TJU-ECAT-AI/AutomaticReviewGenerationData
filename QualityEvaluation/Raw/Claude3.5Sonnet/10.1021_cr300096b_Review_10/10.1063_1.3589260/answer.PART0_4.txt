The given literature does not contain any relevant information to answer the question about selective dehydrogenation reactions, their significance in chemical production, fuel synthesis, and hydrogen storage, or the contributions of reactor and UHV studies to understanding these processes. The text appears to be primarily about ammonia decomposition on bimetallic surfaces and does not discuss the specific topics mentioned in the question. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer based on this document.
