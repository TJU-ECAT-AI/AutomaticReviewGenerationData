The given literature does not contain information relevant to answering the question about selective dehydrogenation reactions, their significance in chemical production, fuel synthesis, and hydrogen storage, or the comparison between reactor studies and UHV studies. The text appears to be mainly about the structure of a scientific paper on ammonia decomposition on bimetallic surfaces, without providing detailed content that would address the specific topics mentioned in the question. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer based on this literature.

所给文献不包含有关选择性脱氢反应、它们在化学生产、燃料合成和氢气储存中的重要性，或反应器研究与超高真空研究之间比较的相关信息。这段文本似乎主要是关于双金属表面上氨分解的科学论文结构，没有提供能够解答问题中提到的具体主题的详细内容。因此，我无法根据这份文献提供答案。
