[1] "TPD results showed that the presence of Au on Pt promoted the selective dehydrogenation of cyclohexene to benzene."

[2] "Cyclohexene has several competitive reaction pathways, including decomposition, dehydrogenation, disproportionation (self-hydrogenation), and hydrogenation."

[3] "Different from Pt, the reaction of cyclohexene on Au/Pt bimetallic surfaces, in particular the 0.5 ML Au/Pt surface, is mainly dehydrogenation; the extent of carbon deposition on 0.5 ML AuPt is also significantly reduced."

[4] "The experiments were carried out in a two-level stainless steel ultra-high vacuum (UHV) chamber with a base pressure of 1 × 1010 Torr, as described previously"

[5] "The UHV system was equipped with a single-pass cylindrical mirror analyzer for Auger electron spectroscopy (AES) characterization and a quadrupole mass spectrometer (QMS) for temperature-programmed desorption (TPD) experiments"

Selective dehydrogenation reactions are significant in chemical production, fuel synthesis, and hydrogen storage due to their ability to produce valuable unsaturated compounds and hydrogen gas. The study of these processes, particularly C-H and N-H bond dehydrogenation over supported catalysts, is crucial for optimizing catalytic processes in various industries.

Reactor studies and Ultra-High Vacuum (UHV) studies contribute significantly to our understanding of these processes by providing complementary information. Reactor studies simulate real-world conditions and allow for the investigation of catalyst performance under industrially relevant pressures and temperatures. On the other hand, UHV studies, as demonstrated in this paper, enable the examination of fundamental surface chemistry and reaction mechanisms at the atomic level.

Key research methods in this field include:

1. Temperature-Programmed Desorption (TPD): This technique allows researchers to study the desorption of products from catalyst surfaces, providing information on reaction kinetics and binding energies.

2. Auger Electron Spectroscopy (AES): This surface-sensitive technique is used to analyze the elemental composition of catalyst surfaces before and after reactions.

3. Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations: These computational methods help predict binding energies and reaction pathways, complementing experimental results.

Characterization techniques typically employed include:

1. Mass spectrometry: Used in conjunction with TPD to identify and quantify reaction products.

2. Spectroscopic methods (e.g., XPS, FTIR): These provide information on the electronic and chemical state of catalysts and adsorbed species.

Reaction conditions investigated often include:

1. Temperature: Varied to study activation energies and reaction kinetics.
2. Pressure: UHV conditions allow for precise control and analysis of surface reactions.
3. Catalyst composition: In this study, the effect of Au/Pt bimetallic surfaces was explored.

These studies inform the optimization of catalytic processes by:

1. Identifying active sites and reaction mechanisms.
2. Understanding the effects of catalyst composition on selectivity and activity.
3. Elucidating the role of promoters or inhibitors in catalytic reactions.
4. Providing insights into catalyst deactivation mechanisms, such as coking or poisoning.

By combining reactor studies with UHV experiments and theoretical calculations, researchers can develop a comprehensive understanding of selective dehydrogenation processes. This knowledge can then be applied to design more efficient and selective catalysts for industrial applications, ultimately leading to improved chemical production, fuel synthesis, and hydrogen storage technologies.

2. 俄歇电子能谱（AES）：这种表面敏感技术用于分析反应前后催化剂表面的元素组成。

3. 密度泛函理论（DFT）计算：这些计算方法有助于预测结合能和反应途径，补充实验结果。

通常使用的表征技术包括：

1. 质谱法：与TPD结合使用，用于识别和量化反应产物。

2. 光谱方法（如XPS，FTIR）：这些方法提供有关催化剂和吸附物种电子和化学状态的信息。

1. 温度：变化以研究活化能和反应动力学。
2. 压力：UHV条件允许精确控制和分析表面反应。
3. 催化剂组成：在本研究中，探讨了Au/Pt双金属表面的效果。

这些研究通过以下方式为催化过程的优化提供信息：

1. 识别活性位点和反应机理。
2. 了解催化剂组成对选择性和活性的影响。
3. 阐明促进剂或抑制剂在催化反应中的作用。
4. 提供有关催化剂失活机制（如结焦或中毒）的见解。

通过将反应器研究与UHV实验和理论计算相结合，研究人员可以全面理解选择性脱氢过程。然后，这些知识可以应用于设计更高效和选择性的工业应用催化剂，最终导致改进的化学生产、燃料合成和氢气储存技术。
