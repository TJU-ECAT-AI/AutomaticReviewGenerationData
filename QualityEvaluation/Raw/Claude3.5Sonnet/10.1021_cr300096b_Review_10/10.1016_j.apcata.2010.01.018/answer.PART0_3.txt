[1] "TPD results showed that the presence of Au on Pt promoted the selective dehydrogenation of cyclohexene to benzene."

[2] "For benzene (C6H6, 78 amu) production on clean Pt, two desorption peaks are observed at 298 K and 375 K. The two peaks could be from the reaction of cyclohexene from the Pt (1 1 1) and Pt (1 0 0) facets in the polycrystalline foil."

[3] "The experiments were carried out in a two-level stainless steel ultra-high vacuum (UHV) chamber with a base pressure of 1 × 1010 Torr, as described previously"

[4] "After synthesizing the surfaces of interest, hydrogen (Matheson, 99.999%), carbon monoxide (CO) (Matheson, 99.999%), and cyclohexene (c-C6H10) (Aldrich, 99+ %) were dosed with the surface temperature at or below 145 K."

[5] "The TPD spectra were taken from 105 K to 800 K with a linear heating rate of 3 K/s."

The study of selective dehydrogenation reactions is significant in chemical production, fuel synthesis, and hydrogen storage due to its potential for efficient conversion of hydrocarbons and ammonia into valuable products and hydrogen. 

Reactor studies and Ultra-High Vacuum (UHV) studies contribute complementary information to our understanding of these processes. Reactor studies provide insights into catalytic performance under realistic operating conditions, while UHV studies allow for precise control of surface conditions and detailed mechanistic investigations.

In this particular study, UHV techniques were employed to investigate C-H bond dehydrogenation over supported catalysts, specifically focusing on cyclohexene dehydrogenation on Pt and Au/Pt surfaces. Key research methods included:

1. Surface preparation and characterization: Clean Pt surfaces were prepared by sputtering and annealing cycles. Au/Pt bimetallic surfaces were created by depositing Au onto Pt. Auger Electron Spectroscopy (AES) was used to characterize surface composition.

2. Temperature Programmed Desorption (TPD): This technique was central to the study, allowing for the analysis of reaction products and their desorption temperatures. TPD experiments were conducted from 105 K to 800 K with a heating rate of 3 K/s.

3. Reactant dosing: Cyclohexene and other gases were dosed onto the prepared surfaces at low temperatures (≤145 K) to ensure adsorption.

4. Complementary theoretical studies: Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations were performed to predict binding energies of atomic species on various surface configurations.

The reaction conditions investigated included different surface compositions (clean Pt vs. Au/Pt bimetallic surfaces) and the effect of pre-adsorbed hydrogen. The study focused on comparing the selectivity towards dehydrogenation (forming benzene) versus other pathways like hydrogenation or total decomposition.

These UHV studies inform the optimization of catalytic processes by:

1. Providing fundamental insights into reaction mechanisms and pathways.
2. Identifying the effects of surface composition on selectivity and activity.
3. Demonstrating how alloying (in this case, with Au) can modify catalytic properties to enhance desired reactions (dehydrogenation) while suppressing unwanted ones (decomposition leading to coking).

While UHV studies offer these detailed mechanistic insights, it's important to note that bridging the gap between UHV conditions and practical reactor conditions remains a challenge in catalyst development. Combining UHV studies with reactor studies and theoretical calculations provides a more comprehensive understanding for optimizing catalytic processes in selective dehydrogenation reactions.

选择性脱氢反应的研究在化学生产、燃料合成和氢储存方面具有重要意义，因为它有潜力将碳氢化合物和氨高效转化为有价值的产品和氢气。

反应器研究和超高真空（UHV）研究为我们理解这些过程提供了互补的信息。反应器研究提供了在实际操作条件下催化性能的见解，而UHV研究则允许精确控制表面条件并进行详细的机理研究。

在这项特定研究中，采用了UHV技术来研究支持型催化剂上的C-H键脱氢，特别关注了Pt和Au/Pt表面上环己烯的脱氢。主要的研究方法包括：

1. 表面制备和表征：通过溅射和退火循环制备干净的Pt表面。通过在Pt上沉积Au来创建Au/Pt双金属表面。使用俄歇电子能谱（AES）来表征表面组成。

2. 程序升温脱附（TPD）：这种技术是研究的核心，允许分析反应产物及其脱附温度。TPD实验在105 K到800 K的温度范围内进行，升温速率为3 K/s。

3. 反应物剂量：在低温（≤145 K）下将环己烯和其他气体吸附到准备好的表面上，以确保吸附。

4. 互补的理论研究：进行密度泛函理论（DFT）计算，以预测各种表面构型上原子物种的结合能。

研究的反应条件包括不同的表面组成（纯Pt与Au/Pt双金属表面）以及预吸附氢气的影响。研究重点比较了朝向脱氢（形成苯）与其他途径（如加氢或完全分解）的选择性。

这些UHV研究通过以下方式为催化过程的优化提供信息：

1. 提供关于反应机理和途径的基本见解。
2. 确定表面组成对选择性和活性的影响。
3. 展示合金化（在本例中，与Au）如何改变催化性能，以增强所需反应（脱氢）同时抑制不需要的反应（导致积碳的分解）。

虽然UHV研究提供了这些详细的机理见解，但值得注意的是，在催化剂开发中，将UHV条件与实际反应器条件联系起来仍然是一个挑战。将UHV研究与反应器研究和理论计算相结合，可以为优化选择性脱氢反应的催化过程提供更全面的理解。
