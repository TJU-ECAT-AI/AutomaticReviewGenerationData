Platinum and tin deposited on γ -Al2O3, MgO, and Mg(Al)O
supports were investigated by CO chemisorption and analytical
electron microscopy in the scanning transmission electron mi-
croscopy with energy-dispersive X-ray spectrometry (STEM/EDX).
Composition and size of individual particles in the 1-nm range
are presented and results are compared with dispersion measure-
ments obtained from volumetric chemisorption. We demonstrate
that dispersion determined by chemisorption measurements can
give unrealistically low values, possibly caused by metalsupport
interaction, while STEM/EDX reveals the correct size of metal par-
ticles. The metalsupport interaction seems not to be present on
γ -Al2O3 support but only on Mg(Al)O and MgO supports. The per-
formance of the catalyst in propane dehydrogenation is related to
the amount of Pt on the metal particle surface. It is shown that
there is a relationship between the composition of metal parti-
cles and the activity of the catalyst. The most active is a cata-
lyst that contains metal particles with high Pt content; however,
some Sn is necessary for reduced coking and probably for increased
stability.

INTRODUCTION
Catalytic dehydrogenation of light alkanes is an impor-
tant industrial process with potential for improvement. No-
bel metals, especially platinum, are key ingredients in most
dehydrogenation catalysts. It has become a common prac-
tice to incorporate a second metal into the catalyst (Sn, Ag,
Ge, Pb) (15) and/or add alkali metals (13). There have
been numerous studies on the effect of Sn in PtSn cata-
lysts, but this is still not completely understood (6, 7). The
promotion of monometallic Pt catalysts by Sn has several
advantages: it prevents the hydrogenolytic effect of plat-
inum, favors the selectivity of the dehydrogenation reac-
tions, mitigates the sintering effect, and decreases the de-

activation rate caused by carbon formation. Contradictory
results have been reported in the literature concerning the
state of Sn. Some studies suggest that Sn is not reduced
to zero valency (8); in other cases, at least part of the Sn
was found to be present as Sn0 after reduction (9, 10). It
also has been reported that intermetallic PtSn particles are
present (10, 11). The state of Sn depends on catalyst prepa-
ration, metal loadings and Pt : Sn ratio, support material,
and pretreatment procedures; therefore, contradictory re-
sults are not surprising. Moreover, Chojnacki and Schmidt
(12) found on PtSn/SiO2 with 2- to 20-nm particles that
Pt and Sn atoms within a single particle do not necessar-
ily form a uniform distribution. It also has been reported
that the metal particles contain less tin than is present over
the entire bulk catalyst (8, 13). It was suggested that the
remaining tin is probably in a highly dispersed state.
The dehydrogenation reactions proceed on small ensem-
bles of surface platinum atoms (14) while hydrogenolysis,
isomerization, and coking proceed through the formation
of highly dehydrogenated species over multiple adsorption
sites. Support materials can modify the selectivity by cata-
lyzing the lateral reactions, but they can also influence the
properties of the final metallic phase. The standard sup-
ports that are usually used are γ -Al2O3 and SiO2; however,
nonacidic supports result in less cracking, fewer polymer-
ization reactions, and remarkable stability. Magnesium alu-
minate (MgAl2O4) has been extensively studied recently
(1517) and is used in the Phillips Star process for dehydro-
genation of low-molecular-weight paraffins (18).
Anewlydevelopedatomic-resolutioninsitutransmission
electron microscopy (TEM) (19) can give insight into the lo-
cation and state of promoter under the reaction conditions
and, therefore, give better understanding of the influence of
the promoter on the catalytic activity. Analytical electron
microscopyscanning transmission electron microscopy
combined with microanalysis by energy-dispersive X-ray
spectrometryhas also proved to be a powerful technique
for studying highly dispersed bimetallic systems, providing
detailed metal particle size and composition information
(20, 21). However, detection of metallic tin species is very
difficult due to the lower electron scattering cross section of

Sn compared to that of Pt, making the Sn-rich particles al-
most indistinguishable from the support. There are several
studies of PtSn catalysts (8, 16, 2224), but none of them
reports detailed compositions of individual metal particles
in the range of 1 nm. However, this is the particle size that
is required for industrial catalysts; therefore, investigation
of such highly dispersed catalysts is important.
In this work, we have compared PtSn catalysts sup-
ported on γ -Al2O3, MgO, and Mg(Al)O. The coexistence
of different bimetallic phases in the catalyst makes it diffi-
cult to interpret data from conventional bulk characteriza-
tion methods such as temperature-programmed reduction
(TPR) or chemisorption. We characterized the catalysts
with the highest resolution analytical electron microscope
available, which provided direct evidence of the composi-
tions of individual metal particles as small as 0.5 nm (few
tens of atoms). Furthermore, we correlated the data with
volumetric chemisorption results to show that chemisorp-
tion can be suppressed due to metalsupport interactions.
Catalyst performance in propane dehydrogenation was
used to demonstrate that not only metal particle size but
also the compositions of individual particles are important
for this reaction.
EXPERIMENTAL
Catalysts
All samples were prepared by impregnation. A γ -Al2O3
(SBET = 308 m2/g) support material from Kaiser Chemicals
and MgO (SBET = 71 m2/g) support from Engelhard Indus-
tries were dried in air for 12 h at 120C. Supports were im-
pregnated to incipient wetness with Sn, using SnCl2 · 2H2O
(Merck, 98100%) and distilled water as solvent, dried in
air at 110C for 12 h, and wet calcined at 550C for 2.5 h,
followed by 2 h of calcination in dry air at the same tem-
perature. The purpose of the wet calcination was to remove
Cl left by the metal salt. Platinum impregnation to incipi-
ent wetness with H2PtCl6 · 6H2O (J. T. Baker; assay, 37.50%
Pt) using distilled water as solvent was followed by drying,

ditions as for the Sn impregnation step. Platinum and tin
contents were measured by atomic absorption spectrome-
try (AAS), which confirmed that neither metal was lost dur-
ing the preparation. The metal contents of the completed
specimens were 0.4 wt% Pt1.3 wt% Sn/γ -Al2O3 (sample
ALU) and 1.0 wt% Pt1.3 wt% Sn/MgO (sample MGO).
Both samples contained low amounts of chlorine, below
theamountdetectablebyionchromatography(0.2wt%).A
third sample on a calcined hydrotalcite, 0.3 wt% Pt1.3 wt%
Sn/Mg(Al)O (sample HT1), was obtained from SINTEF,
Oslo, Norway. In this sample, platinum and tin were im-
pregnated on a form of Mg(Al)O obtained by calcining
hydrotalcite (Mg/Al 2.4) according to published proce-
dures (25, 26). The aluminum atoms are used to stabilize
the support surface area at higher temperatures (27). Sam-
ples examined in a dedicated scanning transmission elec-
tron microscope were in the fresh state or after reduction
in hydrogen for 2 h at 600C (samples labeled F and R,
Table 1).
Volumetric Chemisorption
Volumetric chemisorption of CO was measured at 35C
using a Micromeritics ASAP2010 Chemi instrument. Sam-
ples were heated and reduced in hydrogen at 600C for 2 h
and analyzed. The values reported are related to the dif-
ference between two isotherms with an intermediate evac-
uation down to 105 bar in between for 30 min. It can be
assumed that the adsorption stoichiometry of CO/Pt is close
to 1. It was verified that pure Sn does not chemisorb CO at
35C. We refer to this measured dispersion as chemisorp-
tion dispersion.
Analytical Electron Microscopy
The specimens were examined in a dedicated scanning
transmission electron microscope (STEM) (VG HB-603)
equipped with an energy-dispersive spectrometer (EDX)
system employing a windowless Si(Li) detector (Oxford In-
struments model eXL) (28). The instrument was operated

at 300 kV. Quantitative X-ray analysis of bimetallic nano-
particles smaller than 5 nm requires a dedicated STEM/
EDX instrument with a cold-field emission electron source,
a gun lens, and an energy-dispersive X-ray detector with a
collection angle greater than about 0.1 steradians. Such an
instrument has been used to develop compositionsize dia-
grams for PtRh (21) and PtRe (20) bimetallic catalysts
and is used in this study.
Specimens were prepared for analysis by crushing the
catalyst material in a mortar and pestle and dry dispersing
the finest of the resulting shards on holey carbon films sup-
ported on Ti grids. For each examination a new specimen
was prepared and inserted into the microscope vacuum ap-
proximately 15 h before analysis to remove volatile species.
Images were obtained with the annular dark-field detector
(ADF), generally at magnifications of 25 Mx. The metal
particle size was determined by measuring with a ruler on
a stored digital image. The error in measuring the particle
size was estimated to be 0.2 nm. Shards of catalyst about
0.51 m were analyzed, as smaller ones were unstable on
the carbon film or broke easily into smaller pieces under
the beam. The analysis of metal particles was performed
only for particles on thin layers of support at the edges of
catalyst shards.
Metal particles were analyzed by EDX either in spot
mode or reduced area mode, depending on metal parti-
cle size, thickness of support, and distance from other metal
particles. Spot mode was used for larger metal particles,
metal particles on thicker pieces of support, or when metal
particles were close to one another; in other cases reduced
area mode was used. Examples of collected EDX-spectra

in Fig. 1. Figure 1c shows a spectrum from a 3-nm PtSn par-
ticle and a second spectrum from a region of the support
15 nm away. Note that the spectrum from the support shows
no evidence of Pt and only the slightest suggestion of Sn.
Thus, X-rays from metal particles can legitimately by used
to produce quantitative analyses. It was possible to distin-
guish in the ADF image between Pt-rich and Sn-rich parti-
cles: Pt-rich particles have high contrast and sharp particle
boundaries in annular dark-field images, whereas Sn-rich
particles have lower visibility and look more like blurry
patches with diffuse boundaries (Fig. 2). The smallest de-
tected particles were about 0.5 nm. For reliable analysis (29)
at least 400 counts had to be collected in the PtL(summed
PtLα and PtLβ lines) and SnL (unresolved SnLα and SnLβ
lines) peaks so that the relative counting error in a single
measurement was under 15%. About 30,000 counts in PtL
and SnL were accumulated for larger particles, which corre-
sponds to a counting error of 2%. To produce a meaningful
compositionsize diagram it was necessary to collect data
from about 100 particles on each sample. All EDX spectra
were processed with Desktop Spectrum Analyzer (DTSA)
software produced by the National Institute of Standards

where c is the mass fraction, I is net X-ray intensity, and
k is the CliffLorimer k-factor. X-ray absorption and fluo-
rescence effects were considered negligible in these small
particles. The weight fractions of Pt and Sn in all presented
results are based on
cPt + cSn = 1,

assuming only Pt and Sn exist within the metal particle. If
we substitute Eq. [1.2] into Eq. [1.1] and rearrange it, we
can write as follows:
cPt = k

ISn + k.IPt

[1.3]
A suitable PtSn standard was not available, so the k-factor
was calculated (32) for 300-kV accelerating voltage to be
1.4  0.3, with the error estimated according to Wood et al.
(33). The k-factor does not dramatically influence the cal-
culated composition of the particle. For instance, a particle
that contains 72 wt% Pt using k-factor 1.4 would have com-
position of 76 wt% Pt with k-factor 1.7, and 67 wt% Pt for
k-factor 1.1. This means that the composition of metal par-
ticles is within 5 wt% accuracy in the compositionsize
diagrams presented under Results.
Calculation of Pt Dispersion
An estimate of metal particle dispersion was calculated
from the size (ADF image) and composition (EDX analy-
sis) of each individual metal particle in a sampled popula-
tion of about 100 particles. Two methods were used.
(a) PtSn intermetallic phases.
It was assumed that
equilibrium was reached for the metal particles and that the
phase diagram could be applied. Each of the metal particles
was assigned a phase from the phase diagram correspond-
ing to its composition measured by EDX. A series of Pt,
Pt3Sn, PtSn, Pt2Sn3, PtSn2, and PtSn4 spherical particles,
with diameters corresponding to individual particles found
on the samples, was generated using the program ATOMS
(34). The surface energy of platinum is greater than tin; thus
platinum was used as the center atom of the particles. If tin
hadbeenusedasthecenteratom,thedispersionwouldhave
been about the same for particles larger than about 1.5 nm.
(b) Pt(fcc) structure.
It was assumed that all particles
have the (fcc) structure and that some Pt atoms are replaced
by Sn atoms. A series of spherical particles, with diameters
corresponding to individual particles found on the samples,
was generated using the program ATOMS (34).
The number of platinum atoms and surface platinum
atoms were counted manually for each simulated particle
by displaying it in 3-D. The program ATOMS does not
allow the user to relax the atomic configurations in the par-
ticles; however, we believe that the error this causes in the
number of surface atoms is negligible. A 0.8-nm Pt particle
generated by the program ATOMS was compared with a
particle of the same size in a fully relaxed structure (33).
The number of platinum surface atoms did not change, and
therefore, the same number of molecules could be adsorbed
on both relaxed and unrelaxed particles (Fig. 3). The num-
ber of platinum atoms in a particle obtained from ATOMS
was corrected by the actual composition of the metal parti-
cle. This means that for the first method, where we assume
metal particles have the structures of various PtSn inter-
metallic compounds, a certain number of Pt atoms in the
particle was exchanged for Sn atoms or some Sn atoms were
exchanged for Pt atoms so that the composition of the gen-
erated particle was the same as the composition of the metal
particle obtained by EDX. For instance, if there was a 2-nm
metal particle on the sample that was measured to be 58
wt% Pt (46 at% Pt), it would be closest to the Pt2Sn3 struc-
ture, according to the phase diagram. Program ATOMS
calculated that a 2-nm particle with the Pt2Sn3 structure
would contain 195 atoms with 72 Pt atoms, of which 35 are
Pt surface atoms. The composition of this generated parti-
cle is 37 at% Pt, and therefore, we exchanged 18 Sn atoms

for Pt (9 Pt surface atoms) to obtain 46 at% Pt. A similar
procedure was applied to the second method, where we as-
sumed that the metal particles have (fcc) structure. Finally,
the number of surface platinum atoms in the particles was
counted and the dispersion of each metal particle could be
calculated. We refer to this calculated dispersion as EDX
dispersion.
The results for calculated EDX dispersion using specific
PtSn phases or (fcc) structure are summarized in Table 2,
columns3and4.TheEDXdispersionscalculatedwiththese
two methods are very similar. We assume that the metal
particles are more likely to have the (fcc) structure; there-
fore, we use only EDX dispersion values calculated from
the (fcc) structure in this discussion. We did not attempt
to identify the crystal structure of the particles on diffrac-

a Metal particles with different crystallographic structures and sizes were generated assuming different PtSn phases (using a phase diagram)
according to composition obtained form EDX analysis. Dispersion of each particle was calculated from the total number of Pt atoms and number
of surface Pt atoms in the generated particles and corrected by actual composition of the individual particle.

crystal structure. However, using the (fcc) structure has two
advantages: (a) it is simpler and (b) it does not require the
tenuous assumption involved with the use of specific com-
poundsfromtheequilibrium-phasediagram.Moreover,the

particles across the composition range (Figure 49), with no

The surface composition of a bimetallic particle can differ
from its bulk composition. Even after reduction in hydro-
gen, the Pt : Sn ratio on the surface was found to be lower
than in the bulk, which means that the surface is Sn rich (8,
3638). The equilibrium segregation of Sn to the surface is
likely because Sn has a lower surface energy than Pt. The
surface and bulk compositions of different PtSn bimetal-
lic samples previously reported (8, 3638) indicate that the
Ptsurface : Ptbulk ratio of such samples is about 0.7 (Fig. 10).
This means that the chemisorption measurement will indi-

dispersion(largerapparentsizeofmetalparticles).Wehave
considered this fact by assuming that there are 30% fewer
Pt atoms on the particle surface. Since CO only adsorbs on
Pt we recalculated the EDX dispersion (Table 2, column 4)
values to obtain predicted EDX dispersion for volumetric
chemisorption (Table 2, column 5).
The EDX dispersion for the ALU R sample is 39%, and
the volumetric chemisorption gives a Pt dispersion of 35%
(Table 2). While the EDX dispersion is slightly higher, it
does not take into account those surface Pt atoms that are
inaccessible for CO chemisorption because they are in con-
tact with support (Fig. 11). Estimating from Fig. 11 that

Catalyst Activity
Pelletized samples were crushed and sieved to produce
particles in the range 0.631.00 mm, which were used for
catalytic testing. A fixed-bed titanium reactor was loaded
with approximately 2 g of catalyst. The catalyst was ac-
tivated in situ by five cycles of reduction in hydrogen at
600C, a 2-h propane dehydrogenation at 630C, and regen-
eration at 600C by air diluted with nitrogen. The oxygen
content was initially 2 mol% and was increased in steps up
to 21 mol% (100% air). The last step in pretreatment was
reduction in hydrogen at 600C.
The propane dehydrogenation was performed at a
total pressure in the reactor of 1.1 bar and the reaction
temperature was 600C. The weight hourly space velocity
(WHSV) during propane dehydrogenation was 4 h1 based
on propane, and the reaction mixture contained 4.5 mol%
hydrogen, 32.0 mol% propane, and 63.5 mol% steam.
The catalysts were tested for 10 h and the products were
analyzed with a gas chromatograph equipped with a flame
ionization detector (FID) and a thermal conductivity
detector (TCD). The samples were regenerated at 600C
by air diluted with nitrogen. The oxygen content was
initially 2 mol% and was increased in steps up to 21 mol%
(100% air).
RESULTS
STEM/EDX and Volumetric Chemisorption
The results from STEM/EDX are presented in Figs. 49.
Each point in these compositionsize diagrams represents
the particle size and Pt weight fraction of a single metal par-
ticle. The metal particle size is from the ADF image and the
Pt weight fraction in the metal particle is from EDX analy-
sis. The two inset figures (number of particles vs Pt weight
fraction; number of particles vs particle size) show more
clearly the distribution of values in composition (the up-
per figure) and particle size (the lower figure). These inset
figures allow the reader to distinguish easily single-mode
distributions (Fig. 7) from bimodal distributions (Figs. 4
and 5).
The dispersion results from volumetric chemisorption
are presented in Table 2, column 2. The next two columns
in Table 2 show calculated dispersions from EDX data
using either specific PtSn phases (column 3) or (fcc) struc-
ture (column 4) according to the composition of the metal
particles. We assumed that there are 30% fewer Pt atoms
on the particle surface (Fig. 10) and corrected the data
to obtain EDX dispersion for CO chemisorption (column
5). After correcting for support occlusion of Pt surface

atoms, the ALU R sample has a calculated EDX disper-
sion of 0.31 (column 6), which compares favorably with
the 0.35 dispersion from chemisorption (column 2). The
MGO R and HT1 R EDX dispersion still do not compare
well with chemisorption and reasons will be given in the
discussion.
The EDX dispersion is an averaged dispersion from the
individual metal particles measured. Some samples indi-
cate a bimodal distribution of metal particles, in which each
group has a characteristic particle size (e.g., Fig. 5) and av-
eraging is not appropriate. Metal particle size distribution
and composition on each sample will be presented sepa-
rately. We stress that the averaging of these data is only for
comparison with the chemisorption and activity data.
ALU sample.
The compositionsize diagram of sam-
ple ALU F (Fig. 4) indicates a phase separation. There ap-
pear to be two phases: (a) 0.752.00 nm, 60100 wt% Pt
and (b) 0.755.00 nm, 060 wt% Pt. A characteristic fea-
ture of these phases is that the distribution of metal parti-
cle sizes and compositions is quite large. The composition
of the metal particles changed after reducing the sample
(Fig. 5 compared to Fig. 4). There is still an indication of
two groups, but as shown in Fig. 5, the metal particles are
smaller in both groups and the average Pt content changed
slightlyaswell:(a)0.751.25nm,4590wt%Ptand(b)1.00
3.75 nm, 1045 wt% Pt. Moreover, the number of metal par-
ticles in the first group, Pt rich, increased dramatically. If the
compositions of all the metal particles were homogeneous
and the Pt : Sn ratio was according to nominal metal load-
ing, all the metal particles would contain about 22 wt% Pt
(Table 1). However, only about a half of the metal particles
on fresh sample have 1030 wt% Pt and about a fifth on the
reduced sample. The rest of the metal particles contained a
much higher amount of Pt. We were not able to locate the
remaining Sn with STEM/EDX.
MGO sample.
The number of visible metal particles on
sample MGO F was high, and the support and metal par-
ticles were not easily damaged under the electron beam.
However, the images were blurry, and it was difficult to
recognize metal particle boundaries. Some Sn was present
almost every place on the sample, even when no Sn parti-
cles/patches where visible. There were also several spots on
which Pt was detected but no metal particle was visible. The
compositionsize diagram shows that the observable metal
particles were in a range of 1.003.50 nm (Fig. 6). There is
a greater error in the metal particle size, as it was difficult
to determine the particle boundaries. Because of that and
the very blurry ADF images, only a small number of data
points on this sample was collected. Metal particles on this
sample contained 1580 wt% Pt. The number of metal par-
ticles across this composition range seemed fairly uniform
and formed only one group (one phase).
After reducing the sample, the number of visible metal
particles increased dramatically, and the particle bound-
aries became well-defined (MGO R). It was the only sam-
ple in which metal particles of about 1 nm were also visi-
ble in the bright-field image. The compositionsize diagram
(Fig. 7) shows that the size of the metal particles is between
0.75 and 2.00 nm and particles seem to form only one group,
as on the fresh sample. The composition of the metal par-
ticles is between 25 and 80 wt% Pt, and the distributions
of both composition and size have approximately a Gaus-
sian shape. The greatest number of metal particles is in the
range 5070 wt% Pt. The composition of metal particles is
about the same as for sample MGO F, while the metal par-
ticle size appears to have decreased slightly. There is some
uncertainty, since we are aware of larger errors in the metal
particle size on sample MGO F. According to the nominal
composition measurement, the metal particles on sample
MGO R should have about 44 wt% Pt (Table 1), but it can
be seen from the compositionsize diagram that the metal
particles contain slightly more Pt. We could not locate any
Sn-rich particles or patches that would account for the miss-
ing Sn.
HT1 sample.
The metal particles in the HT1 sample
were very difficult to image and analyze for at least the
following reasons. First, the support material is highly crys-
talline and the small crystallites often tend to bend or over-
lap. Because the crystallites are on the order of a few
nanometers, the bending causes strong Bragg diffraction,
which tends to look like a metal particle in both bright-
field (BF) and annular dark-field (ADF) images. In addi-
tion, when single crystals of support overlap, a bright spot
is observed in the ADF image that is often indistinguish-
able from a metal particle. Second, the Mg(Al)O support is
much more susceptible to electron beam damage than the
γ -Al2O3 or MgO supports. Thus, regardless of whether the
X-rays were collected when the beam was in spot mode or
in scanning mode at 5 Mx, the support material was rapidly
destroyed and the metal particle either moved away from
thebeam,waslostcompletely,orwasburiedinacontamina-
tion layer such that it could not be recognized after a short
analysis time. Third, metal particles smaller than 1 nm were
observed occasionally, but they could be analyzed in only
a few cases because they disappeared (due to contamina-
tion or beam damage) faster than data could be collected.
Fourth, metal particles rich in Sn were difficult to locate due
to their lower contrast and less visible boundaries.
The fresh sample (HT1 F) seems to have the bimodal
distribution: a group of metal particles in the range 0.50
4.00 nm and rich in Sn (045 wt% Pt); and a second group
of size 0.751.50 nm that have a Pt content of 45100 wt%
(Fig. 8). The number of metal particles visible after the
reduction increased. Data for approximately the same num-
ber of particles were collected, and visibility (contrast be-
tween metal particles and support) increased as well. The
reductionofsampleHT1 Falsochangedthecompositionof
metal particles dramatically. The compositionsize diagram
PtSn PARTICLES ON VARIOUS SUPPORTS
343
for HT1 R (Fig. 9) shows a group of metal particles with a
wide range of composition (3095 wt% Pt) and a fairly nar-
row metal particle size range, 0.752.50 nm. The Sn-rich
group that was present on sample HT1 F disappeared, and
the number of Pt-rich particles increased. The composition
of metal particles is very different from what would be ex-
pected from the bulk Pt : Sn ratio on the sample which was
1 : 4.9 (Table 1). It is not appropriate to calculate a Pt : Sn
ratio from the measured distributions. However, it should
be noted that the sample contains five times more Sn than
Pt, but we detected more Pt-rich particles. The fresh sample
had about 40% of its particles containing more than 50 wt%
Pt, while the reduced sample had about 85% of such metal
particles. This is a larger discrepancy than for the other two
samples.
Catalyst Testing
A comparison of catalyst performance at standard oper-
ating conditions typical for the propane dehydrogenation
process is shown in Fig. 12. The selectivity to propene was
close to 90% for all the samples. The initial selectivities to
by-products are listed in Fig. 13. The highest conversion of
propane is obtained from the HT1 R catalyst and the lowest
from the ALU R catalyst. The catalysts on basic supports
(MGO R, HT1 R) deactivated only slightly over the 10-h
dehydrogenation period, with a decrease in activity ((initial
activityfinal activity)/initial activity) of about 24%. How-
ever, the decrease in activity of the ALU R sample was
54% (Fig. 12).

DISCUSSION
Average composition from the particle distributions
measured by EDX are presented in Table 1. A majority
of the detected particles on all the samples were bimetal-
lic, containing both platinum and tin. It is known that Cl
affects the PtSn catalysts (39); thus one could argue that
the intimacy between Pt and Sn is caused by the presence
of Cl. However, the analysis of samples after preparation
indicated very low amount of Cl. Chlorine can also be re-
liably detected with EDS down to about 0.10.5 wt% in
a local region. The samples investigated in STEM/EDX
did not reveal a Cl peak at 2.42.6 keV (Cl K-line) above
background (Fig. 1); thus chlorine can only be present in
amounts less than 0.1 wt% (under the amount detectable
by STEM/EDX). But of course there are caveats. First, the
beam can cause a mobile element like Cl to move away from
under the beam. Thus, the best chance of detection would
be with the shorter collection times. Second, the analysis
performed with the STEM/EDX is very localized, and the
Cl (if present) may actually reside elsewhere on the sup-
port. However, Cl was not detected at short or long collec-
tion times on the metal particles and also not on the sup-
port. Third, Cl is ubiquitous and has been detected in the
STEM from specimens that picked up Cl vapor from the lab
environment.
The average Pt content measured in metal particles on
the MgO support is close to that introduced by impreg-
nation. However, the Pt content in particles is more than
twice nominal content when particles are on γ -Al2O3 and
Mg(Al)O supports. It is obvious that all the detected metal
particles on all the samples contain higher amounts of Pt
compared to the nominal loading (Table 1). There are at
least two possibile reasons for this observation: (a) part of
theSnevaporatedor(b)Snisspreadonthemonolayerlevel
over the whole sample and is not generally visible on ADF
images. These Sn-rich areas are only visible if the number
344

of Sn layers is high enough, and in such cases these areas
look like bright patches against darker support material.
The latter possibility is supported by the fact that Sn occa-
sionally could be detected on the support in regions with
no visible particle (Fig. 14), mainly on the ALU. There is
the possibility that electrons scattered from the beam loca-
tion could excite Sn X-rays from nearby particles; however,
in some locations no Sn was found on the support next to
Sn-rich particles. The fact that Sn could be spread on the
support would agree with Merlen et al. (8), who found that
bimetallic phases on γ -Al2O3 are more easily obtained for
larger metal particles than for small ones. In the latter case,
the metal particles may be too small to stabilize tin in the
metallic state. These authors suggest that tin probably mi-
grates onto the support and remains in an oxidized state in
the vicinity of the particle. This is also in agreement with
Schwank et al. (22), who found tin within close proxim-
ity of platinum particles supported on γ -Al2O3. They also
observed platinumtin alloy particles in a few instances.
However, most of the platinum in their case was present in
monometallic form, with some metal particles in intimate
contact with patches of ionic tin.
A comparison of fresh and reduced samples (Figs. 49)
shows that the composition and size of the metal parti-
cles changed after reduction. On samples with a bimodal
metal particle size distribution (ALU and HT1), the size of
Pt-rich particles decreased slightly during reduction, while
the size of Sn-rich particles tended to decrease noticeably.
Moreover, the number of measured Sn-rich particles was
smaller on the reduced samples (ALU R, HT1 R). Reduc-
tion seems to cause Sn migration from the metal particles
onto the support, and Sn could spread onto the support
in a monolayer (which was not detectable in our experi-
ments). The Sn migration from metal particles during re-
duction would show on the compositionsize diagrams as a
decrease in Sn-rich particle size and a shift toward high Pt
weight percent in all metal particles.
The method for calculating the dispersion from EDX
data (Table 2, column 6) is in good agreement with the ex-
perimental chemisorption result (Table 2, column 2) for the
ALU R sample: the EDX dispersion was 0.31 compared to
0.35 obtained from volumetric chemisorption. In contrast,
thechemisorptiondispersionfortheMGO Rsampleisonly
9%, although the predicted value from EDX data is 40%
(Table 2). This means that 78% of surface Pt atoms are
unable to chemisorb CO under the conditions used for vol-
umetric chemisorption (Table 2, column 7), and such a large
discrepancy cannot be ascribed to partial blockage of Pt sur-
face atoms by the support. Rather it could be caused by a
special PtO surface interaction, reported by other authors
(4043) on Pt/MgO and by Kazansky and Borovkov (44) on
Pt/Mg(Al)O. They suggest that Pt particles, are negatively
charged due to electron transfer from basic oxygen anions
to the Pt particles, thus preventing donation of the lone pair
on carbon to the metal. This may be the reason chemisorp-
tion measurements gave a lower dispersion than would be
expected from STEM results and activity tests. The total
amount of adsorbed CO is not effected dramatically by Sn.
However, microcalorimetric studies (45, 46) showed that
although the initial differential heat of adsoption is about
the same for Pt and PtSn catalysts, the apparent distribu-
tion of site strengths for the adsorption of CO on PtSn
catalysts is different compared to Pt catalysts. The adsorp-
tion sites that adsorb CO most strongly decrease substan-
tially on PtSn catalysts and the highest population of the
adsorption sites shifted to lower differential heats (lower
site strengths). It was also reported (4749) earlier that the
probe molecule (CO) can be removed by evacuation. The
removedmoleculescouldbephysicallyadsorbedand/ornot
very strongly chemisorbed on Pt. In this study, we suggest
that CO was not adsorbed strongly enough on Pt atoms
supported on Mg(Al)O and MgO and a 30-min evacuation
removed it. We showed that a large percentage of CO can
be removed by evacuation (50) on Mg(Al)O samples with
PtSn PARTICLES ON VARIOUS SUPPORTS
345
similar EDX dispersion, and that the amount of removed
CO depends on the preparation method. We also demon-
strated earlier (50) that dispersion calculated from the total
amount of adsorbed CO is close to EDX dispersion. The
presence of Sn does not have a strong effect on the fraction
of CO that is removed (50). It is the support material that
influences the adsorption properties of Pt.
Similarly, volumetric chemisorption for the HT1 R
sample yields a dispersion of only 18%, while the predicted
EDX dispersion is 39% (Table 2, column 2 and 6). This
means that 54% of surface Pt atoms are not able to chem-
isorb CO or chemisorb CO weakly (Table 2, column 7).
Thus, the number of Pt surface atoms that chemisorb CO
after evacuating the sample is between that for the ALU R
and the MGO R samples; it is higher than on MgO support
but lower than on γ -Al2O3. This supports the theory
of interaction between Pt and O on MgO-rich supports.
The strong metalsupport interaction is the weakest on
γ -Al2O3 support, if it occurs at all, and increases in the
order γ -Al2O3 < Mg(Al)O < MgO. Furthermore, it is clear
that CO chemisorption is not an applicable technique for
dispersion measurements of Pt on MgO-rich supports.
The propane conversions and selectivities to propene are
presented in Fig. 12. For purposes of comparison, we as-
sumed in Table 3 that the HT1 R catalyst had a relative
conversion of 100% and scaled the other conversions for
ALU R and MGO R catalysts. The catalysts regained their
original activity after the regeneration procedure, which in-
dicates that the deactivation was not permanent and that
carbon deposition is the main cause of the deactivation.
Catalyst activity is connected with the amount of Pt in
the metal particles. The variation in the number of active
Pt surface atoms is not due to the change in metal particle
size, as all Pt-rich particle diameters were around 1 nm, as
shown in the compositionsize diagrams. The ALU R sam-
ple contains two groups of metal particles (Fig. 5), and we
expect that the second group, larger Sn-rich particles, have
verylow,ifany,activityinpropanedehydrogenation.There-
fore, we assume that Pt surface atoms in this Sn-rich group
have no activity. It was reported by Dong et al. (51) that the
conversion can decrease over a catalyst with a low Pt : Sn
ratio, which presumably consists largely of Sn-rich particles.

We believe that a certain percentage of Sn in the Pt-rich
metal particles is essential to decrease the deactivation rate
(53) and that the rest of the Sn should be deposited on the
support, preventing sintering of Pt-rich particles (16). It is
generally assumed (54) that the rate of carbon formation is
comparable on Pt and PtSn catalysts; however, the pres-
ence of Sn increases the catalyst stability. Therefore, the
most active and stable catalyst would have Pt-rich particles
although not pure Pt.
It is very often assumed that it is the total number of Pt
surface atoms that is important and that determines the ac-
tivity of the catalyst. Our samples have fairly similar EDX
dispersion (Table 2); thus the conversion should be related
to the nominal loading of Pt on the sample. We can see from
Table 3 that the MGO R sample has the highest amount of
Pt per gram of catalyst. But it is not the most active catalyst.
The sample that gives the highest conversion is the one that
has in fact the lowest amount of Pt. That shows clearly that
the amount of Pt is not crucial. However, we can see from
Table 3 that there is a relationship between the conversion
ofpropaneandthefractionofPtinthemetalparticles.From
Fig. 9 it can be seen that sample HT1 R has the highest
population of Pt-rich particles, containing 6090 wt% Pt.
The second highest would be the MGO R sample, which
has metal particles with compositions in the range 4565
wt% Pt. The ALU R sample has the lowest number of Pt
surface atoms available for propane dehydrogenation be-
cause almost half of the Pt surface atoms are present in
Sn-rich particles (and thus are not counted as active). The
compositionsize diagrams and Table 3 show that the con-
version increases with increasing amount of Pt in the metal
particles. This is very important finding that would not be
possible to discover without detailed composition and size
of individual metal particles on PtSn catalysts.
The distribution of by-products in Fig. 13 shows that γ -
Al2O3 support results in more higher hydrocarbons formed
by polymerization reactions compared to the MgO and
Mg(Al)O supports. The latter catalysts produce more CO2,
which indicates that the supports help to gasify coke.
CONCLUSION
A detailed study of the composition and size of individ-
ual PtSn metal particles on γ -Al2O3, MgO, and Mg(Al)O
has been presented. A method for calculating dispersion
from STEM/EDX data for bimetallic catalysts was devel-
oped. Dispersion results by this method were in good agree-
ment with those obtained from volumetric chemisorption
for PtSn/γ -Al2O3. Poor correlation of dispersion results
for MgO and Mg(Al)O supports is attributed to interac-
tion between Pt and MgO (strong metalsupport interac-
tion). Thus, some platinum surface atoms may adsorb CO
weakly and thus CO can be removed during evacuation.
STEM/EDX is therefore a suitable method for evaluating

the PtSn catalysts. Metal particles contain more platinum
than would be expected from the Pt : Sn ratio that was de-
posited on the catalyst. Some samples contained at least two
groups of metal particles with characteristic size and com-
position. It was shown that the composition and the size of
metal particles can change dramatically after reduction: the
metal particle size tends to decrease and Sn-rich particles
either disappear or the percentage of them decreases. The
conversion of propane correlates well with the Pt fraction
in the metal particles. The most active is a catalyst that con-
tains metal particles with high Pt content; however, some
Sn is necessary for increased stability.
