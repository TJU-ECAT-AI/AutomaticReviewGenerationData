[1] "We have investigated how alloyed Sn at a Pt(111) surface alters the adsorption, desorption, and reactive chemistry of linear C6-hydrocarbon molecules containing an increasing degree of unsaturation: n-hexane, 1-hexene, and 1,5-hexadiene."

[2] "This chemistry was investigated on Pt(111) and two bimetallic surfaces, the (2 × 2)-Sn/Pt(111) and (3 × 3)R30-Sn/Pt(111) surface alloys, by using temperature-programmed desorption and Auger electron spectroscopy."

[3] "Alloying with Sn decreased the amount of irreversibly chemisorbed 1-hexene at monolayer coverage from 65% on Pt(111) to 18% on the (2 × 2) alloy, and dehydrogenation was eliminated on the (3 × 3)R30 alloy."

[4] "This work extends our understanding of hydrocarbon chemistry at PtSn alloy surfaces and may aid in understanding current catalysts used for hydrocarbon reforming and the development of new catalysts for selective hydrogenation."

[5] "Supported platinum catalysts are widely used to carry out skeletal reactions of alkanes, an important process in naphtha reforming."

Selective dehydrogenation reactions are significant in chemical production, fuel synthesis, and potentially hydrogen storage due to their ability to produce valuable unsaturated hydrocarbons and hydrogen. Both reactor studies and ultra-high vacuum (UHV) studies contribute to our understanding of these processes, particularly for C-H bond dehydrogenation over supported catalysts.

UHV studies, as demonstrated in this paper, allow for precise control and characterization of surface structures and reactions at the molecular level. The researchers used well-defined Pt(111) and PtSn alloy surfaces to investigate the adsorption, desorption, and reactivity of linear C6 hydrocarbons with varying degrees of unsaturation. This approach enables a fundamental understanding of how surface composition and structure affect reactivity.

Key research methods in UHV studies include temperature-programmed desorption (TPD) and Auger electron spectroscopy (AES). These techniques allow researchers to probe the energetics of molecular adsorption and desorption, as well as the extent of surface reactions such as dehydrogenation. By systematically varying the surface composition (e.g., different PtSn alloy structures), researchers can correlate atomic-scale surface properties with reactivity.

The study reveals how alloying Sn with Pt dramatically affects the dehydrogenation activity of the surface. For instance, the dehydrogenation of 1-hexene was reduced from 65% on Pt(111) to 18% on the (2x2)-Sn/Pt(111) alloy and completely eliminated on the (3x3)R30°-Sn/Pt(111) alloy. This demonstrates how precise control of surface composition can tune catalytic selectivity.

While UHV studies provide fundamental insights, reactor studies are crucial for understanding catalyst behavior under more realistic conditions. Reactor studies typically involve higher pressures, gas-phase reactants, and supported catalysts rather than single-crystal surfaces. These studies often focus on reaction kinetics, product distributions, and catalyst stability over time.

The combination of UHV and reactor studies informs the optimization of catalytic processes by bridging the gap between fundamental surface science and applied catalysis. Insights from UHV studies, such as the role of specific surface sites in dehydrogenation reactions, can guide the design of more selective and efficient catalysts for real-world applications like naphtha reforming or hydrogen production.

In conclusion, both UHV and reactor studies are essential for advancing our understanding of selective dehydrogenation reactions. UHV studies provide atomic-level insights into reaction mechanisms and surface-structure relationships, while reactor studies validate these findings under more realistic conditions and address practical concerns like catalyst stability and selectivity. Together, these approaches drive the development of improved catalysts for chemical production, fuel synthesis, and potentially hydrogen storage applications.

选择性脱氢反应在化学生产、燃料合成和潜在的氢储存方面具有重要意义，因为它们能够生产有价值的不饱和烃和氢气。反应器研究和超高真空(UHV)研究都有助于我们理解这些过程，特别是在负载型催化剂上的C-H键脱氢反应。

如本文所示，UHV研究允许在分子水平上精确控制和表征表面结构和反应。研究人员使用明确定义的Pt(111)和PtSn合金表面来研究具有不同不饱和度的线性C6烃的吸附、脱附和反应性。这种方法能够从根本上理解表面组成和结构如何影响反应活性。

UHV研究的关键研究方法包括程序升温脱附(TPD)和俄歇电子能谱(AES)。这些技术允许研究人员探测分子吸附和脱附的能量学，以及表面反应（如脱氢）的程度。通过系统地改变表面组成（例如，不同的PtSn合金结构），研究人员可以将原子尺度的表面性质与反应活性关联起来。

研究揭示了将Sn与Pt合金化如何显著影响表面的脱氢活性。例如，1-己烯的脱氢从Pt(111)上的65%减少到(2x2)-Sn/Pt(111)合金上的18%，并在(3x3)R30°-Sn/Pt(111)合金上完全消除。这表明精确控制表面组成可以调节催化选择性。

虽然UHV研究提供了基本见解，但反应器研究对于理解在更实际条件下的催化剂行为至关重要。反应器研究通常涉及更高的压力、气相反应物和负载型催化剂，而不是单晶表面。这些研究通常关注反应动力学、产物分布和催化剂随时间的稳定性。

UHV和反应器研究的结合通过桥接基础表面科学和应用催化之间的差距，为催化过程的优化提供了信息。UHV研究的见解，如特定表面位点在脱氢反应中的作用，可以指导设计更具选择性和效率的催化剂，用于实际应用，如石脑油重整或氢气生产。

总之，UHV和反应器研究对于推进我们对选择性脱氢反应的理解都是至关重要的。UHV研究提供了反应机理和表面结构关系的原子水平见解，而反应器研究则在更实际的条件下验证这些发现，并解决催化剂稳定性和选择性等实际问题。这两种方法共同推动了化学生产、燃料合成和潜在的氢储存应用中改进催化剂的发展。
