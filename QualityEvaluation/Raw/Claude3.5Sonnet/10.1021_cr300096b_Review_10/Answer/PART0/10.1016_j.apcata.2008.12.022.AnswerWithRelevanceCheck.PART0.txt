          [1] "As industrial demand for propylene grows, its production via dehydrogenation (DH) of propane is assuming greater importance."

[2] "DH of propane is highly endothermic and therefore requires high reaction temperatures (around 600 8C). As a consequence of these high reaction temperatures, the process suffers from poor economy and rapid catalyst deactivation due to coke formation."

[3] "As an alternative to ODH, a new method based on a combination of DH with selective hydrogen combustion (SHC) has been proposed. The reaction equilibrium can be shifted toward the desired products by selective combustion of hydrogen formed via DH."

[4] "The most challenging aspect is the selective combustion of hydrogen in the presence of propane and propylene, which are both easily combustible."

[5] "Pt-Sn catalysts are known for their high selectivity and stability in the propane DH reaction; they should therefore be able to catalyze both DH and SHC reactions."

[6] "CO adsorption measurements were conducted at 25 8C to determine the number of surface Pt atoms based on the assumption that the ratio of adsorbed CO molecules and surface platinum atoms equals 1."

[7] "RAD-B system (Rigaku Corporation) and FT/IR350 (JASCO Corporation) were employed for X-Ray Diffraction (XRD) measurements and Fourier-Transformed Infrared (FT-IR) measurements of adsorbed carbon monoxide."

[8] "It has been suggested by other research groups [15,18 21] that the decrease in the ratio of surface Pt due to Sn addition results from Pt-Sn alloy formation and surface Pt dilution with Sn"

[9] "Many efforts have been made to clarify the relationship between the structure of Pt-Sn catalysts and the effects of Sn addition on normal propane DH."

          Selective dehydrogenation reactions, particularly propane dehydrogenation (DH), are significant in chemical production due to the growing industrial demand for propylene. These reactions are important for fuel synthesis and potentially for hydrogen storage applications.

The significance of these reactions includes:
1. Meeting increasing demand for propylene
2. Overcoming thermodynamic limitations through innovative approaches like combining DH with selective hydrogen combustion (SHC)
3. Improving process efficiency and economics

Reactor studies contribute to our understanding by:
1. Evaluating catalyst performance under realistic conditions
2. Optimizing reaction parameters (temperature, feed composition, contact time)
3. Assessing catalyst stability and selectivity over time
4. Investigating novel process combinations (e.g., DH with SHC)

Key research methods and characterization techniques include:
1. Fixed-bed flow reactor experiments
2. CO adsorption measurements
3. BET surface area analysis
4. X-Ray Diffraction (XRD)
5. Fourier-Transformed Infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy

Typical reaction conditions investigated:
1. High temperatures (around 600°C for propane DH)
2. Various feed compositions and ratios
3. Different contact times

These studies inform catalyst optimization by:
1. Identifying effective catalyst compositions (e.g., Pt-Sn bimetallic catalysts)
2. Understanding the effects of additives (e.g., Sn) on catalyst performance
3. Elucidating reaction mechanisms and the role of catalyst structure in selectivity
4. Investigating the relationship between catalyst structure and performance

While the document doesn't explicitly discuss UHV studies or N-H bond dehydrogenation, the research methods and characterization techniques described are broadly applicable to studying various selective dehydrogenation reactions, including C-H and potentially N-H bond dehydrogenation over supported catalysts.
