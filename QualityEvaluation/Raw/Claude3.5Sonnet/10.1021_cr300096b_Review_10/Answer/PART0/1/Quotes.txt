"We have investigated how alloyed Sn at a Pt(111) surface alters the adsorption, desorption, and reactive chemistry of linear C6-hydrocarbon molecules containing an increasing degree of unsaturation: n-hexane, 1-hexene, and 1,5-hexadiene."

"This chemistry was investigated on Pt(111) and two bimetallic surfaces, the (2 × 2)-Sn/Pt(111) and (3 × 3)R30-Sn/Pt(111) surface alloys, by using temperature-programmed desorption and Auger electron spectroscopy."

"Experiments were performed in a three-level UHV chamber that has been described earlier."

"This work extends our understanding of hydrocarbon chemistry at PtSn alloy surfaces and may aid in understanding current catalysts used for hydrocarbon reforming and the development of new catalysts for selective hydrogenation."

"TPD results showed that the presence of Au on Pt promoted the selective dehydrogenation of cyclohexene to benzene."

"Cyclohexene has several competitive reaction pathways, including decomposition, dehydrogenation, disproportionation (self-hydrogenation), and hydrogenation."

"Different from Pt, the reaction of cyclohexene on Au/Pt bimetallic surfaces, in particular the 0.5 ML Au/Pt surface, is mainly dehydrogenation; the extent of carbon deposition on 0.5 ML AuPt is also significantly reduced."

"The experiments were carried out in a two-level stainless steel ultra-high vacuum (UHV) chamber with a base pressure of 1 × 1010 Torr, as described previously"

"The UHV system was equipped with a single-pass cylindrical mirror analyzer for Auger electron spectroscopy (AES) characterization and a quadrupole mass spectrometer (QMS) for temperature-programmed desorption (TPD) experiments"

"TPD experiments
After synthesizing the surfaces of interest, hydrogen (Matheson, 99.999%), carbon monoxide (CO) (Matheson, 99.999%), and cyclohexene (c-C6H10) (Aldrich, 99+ %) were dosed with the surface temperature at or below 145 K."

"The TPD spectra were taken from 105 K to 800 K with a linear heating rate of 3 K/s."

"Iso-butane dehydrogenation has also been studied over PtSn supported on silica, and on l-zeolite."

"Catalytic behaviour in iso-butane dehydrogenation was conducted using a stainless-steel apparatus and a glass, continuous-flow reactor."

"The catalysts have been characterised by temperature-programmed reduction (TPR), adsorption microcalorimetry of CO at room temperature and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy after in situ reduction at 773 K."

"Temperature-programmed reduction (TPR) measurements were carried out on a U-shaped quartz reactor under a 5%H2/He gas flow of 50 cm3 min1 and about 200 mg of sample. Hydrogen consumption was followed by on-line mass spectrometry."

"The chemical surface analysis of the catalysts, both in fresh and reduced states, was studied by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). Zinc in the bimetallic catalyst was also analyzed by Auger electron spectroscopy (AES), simultaneously to the XPS measurements."

"The improvement in catalytic properties (activity, selectivity and stability) of bimetallic catalyst with regards to the monometallic can be also explained in this case by the formation of PtZn bimetallic particles."

"Thus, the formation of PtZn bimetallic particles (based on TPR and microcalorimetry results) reduces the size of the surface Pt ensembles, suppresses the undesired reactions and enhances selectivity and stability."

[1] "Dehydrogenation of cyclohexane to benzene has been carried out over Ni supported on activated carbon cloth ACC (Ni/ACC) catalysts under spray-pulsed mode reactor to study hydrogen evolution for hydrogen storage and supply system applications."

[3] "Selectivity towards dehydrogenation observed to be enhanced by addition of Pt into Ni/ACC catalysts."

"Hydrogenation of methylacetylene to form propylene is the most favored reaction pathway on all three surfaces accounting for ca 20% of the adsorbed monolayer."

"Addition of Sn to the Pt(111) surface to form these two ordered surface alloys suppresses the decomposition of methylacetylene to surface carbon."

"The alloy surfaces also greatly increase the amount of reversibly adsorbed methylacetylene, from none on Pt(111) to 60% of the adsorbed layer on the (E3×E3)R30Sn/Pt(111) surface alloy."

"Experiments were performed in a stainless steel UHV chamber equipped with instrumentation for Auger electron spectroscopy (AES), low energy electron diffraction (LEED) and Ar+ ion sputtering. A shielded UTI 100C quadrupole mass spectrometer (QMS) was used for TPD."

"All TPD measurements were made using the QMS in line-of-sight with the sample surface and using a linear heating rate of 4 K s1."

"Increasing the concentration of Sn in the Pt(111) surface also changes the H2 desorption temperature from dehydrogenation during TPD."

[1] "Light olefins are widely employed in industry, as they are involved in processes such as production of polymers, ethers, nitriles, new gasolines, etc. Most of these olefins are obtained as by-products of both thermal and catalytic cracking processes, and so, the volume of gasoline required by the market determines the availability of olefins."

[2] "The dehydrogenation of light paraffins to olefins is an endothermic reaction; that it is why it requires the application of relatively severe operation conditions (temperature above 500 8C in the case of isobutane)."

[3] "Pt/g-Al2O3 catalysts are active in the paraffins dehydrogenation process, but they deactivate very quickly and have a poor selectivity towards olefins, mainly caused by the existence of cracking and isomerization reactions."

[5] "As a test method, the catalysts studied in this work were submitted to the dehydrogenation reaction of isobutane to isobutene."

[1] "As industrial demand for propylene grows, its production via dehydrogenation (DH) of propane is assuming greater importance."

[2] "DH of propane is highly endothermic and therefore requires high reaction temperatures (around 600 8C). As a consequence of these high reaction temperatures, the process suffers from poor economy and rapid catalyst deactivation due to coke formation."

[3] "As an alternative to ODH, a new method based on a combination of DH with selective hydrogen combustion (SHC) has been proposed. The reaction equilibrium can be shifted toward the desired products by selective combustion of hydrogen formed via DH."

[4] "The most challenging aspect is the selective combustion of hydrogen in the presence of propane and propylene, which are both easily combustible."

[4] "The dehydration of alkanes is an important part of industrial processes used to produce polymers, ethers, and gasoline. Another potential use of dehydrogenation is to store hydrogen in a chemical with a higher volumetric energy density than hydrogen and to subsequently dehydrogenate the chemical when hydrogen is needed."

[5] "Current high-temperature dehydration processes lead to sintering and rapid deactivation of catalysts, but by modifying Pt catalysts with a second metal, the selectivity, activity, and stability of the catalyst are maintained."

[6] "Reactor studies also show that adding only a small amount of Sn to Pt catalysts improves the dehydrogenation selectivity and reduces the deactivation rate."

[7] "The reforming of gasoline and diesel fuels has been proposed as a short-term option of H2 storage. Gasoline and diesel are both currently available, and using them as a hydrogen carrier instead of direct fuels could achieve some immediate reduction in greenhouse gas emissions."

[6] "Our experimental findings support the proposed computational framework in which potential (complex) bimetallic catalysts can effectively be screened using a library of binding energies of bimetallic catalysts from DFT calculations guided from full, first-principles-based microkinetic models."

[7] "The binding energy of the nitrogen atom to the surface must be strong enough for dehydrogenation of the NHx species to occur, but sufficiently weak that the nitrogen recombines to desorb from the surface to complete the catalytic cycle."
