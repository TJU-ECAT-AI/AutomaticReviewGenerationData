          "Hydrogenation of methylacetylene to form propylene is the most favored reaction pathway on all three surfaces accounting for ca 20% of the adsorbed monolayer."

"Addition of Sn to the Pt(111) surface to form these two ordered surface alloys suppresses the decomposition of methylacetylene to surface carbon."

"The alloy surfaces also greatly increase the amount of reversibly adsorbed methylacetylene, from none on Pt(111) to 60% of the adsorbed layer on the (E3×E3)R30Sn/Pt(111) surface alloy."

"Experiments were performed in a stainless steel UHV chamber equipped with instrumentation for Auger electron spectroscopy (AES), low energy electron diffraction (LEED) and Ar+ ion sputtering. A shielded UTI 100C quadrupole mass spectrometer (QMS) was used for TPD."

"All TPD measurements were made using the QMS in line-of-sight with the sample surface and using a linear heating rate of 4 K s1."

"Increasing the concentration of Sn in the Pt(111) surface also changes the H2 desorption temperature from dehydrogenation during TPD."

          This study provides insights into selective dehydrogenation reactions, particularly focusing on C-H bond dehydrogenation over supported catalysts. The research methods employed include ultra-high vacuum (UHV) studies, which allow for precise control and analysis of surface reactions. Key characterization techniques used were Auger electron spectroscopy (AES), low energy electron diffraction (LEED), and temperature programmed desorption (TPD).

The study examined the adsorption and reaction of methylacetylene on Pt(111) and Sn/Pt(111) surface alloys. Key findings include:

1. Hydrogenation of methylacetylene to propylene was the most favored reaction pathway on all surfaces, accounting for about 20% of the adsorbed monolayer.

2. Adding Sn to the Pt(111) surface suppressed the decomposition of methylacetylene to surface carbon.

3. Alloy surfaces greatly increased the amount of reversibly adsorbed methylacetylene, from none on Pt(111) to 60% on the (E3×E3)R30Sn/Pt(111) surface alloy.

4. Increasing the concentration of Sn in the Pt(111) surface changed the H2 desorption temperature during TPD, indicating changes in the C-H bond breaking process.

These UHV studies contribute to our understanding of selective dehydrogenation by providing detailed insights into surface reactions, adsorption behaviors, and the effects of alloying on catalytic properties. Such information is crucial for optimizing catalytic processes in chemical production and fuel synthesis.

However, it's important to note that UHV studies have limitations in directly representing industrial conditions. To fully optimize catalytic processes, these fundamental studies need to be complemented with studies under more realistic reaction conditions and on supported catalysts.

          这项研究为选择性脱氢反应提供了见解，特别关注了负载型催化剂上C-H键的脱氢。所采用的研究方法包括超高真空（UHV）研究，这允许对表面反应进行精确控制和分析。使用的主要表征技术包括俄歇电子能谱（AES）、低能电子衍射（LEED）和程序升温脱附（TPD）。

该研究考察了甲基乙炔在Pt(111)和Sn/Pt(111)表面合金上的吸附和反应。主要发现包括：

1. 甲基乙炔氢化生成丙烯是所有表面上最有利的反应途径，占吸附单层的约20%。

2. 将Sn添加到Pt(111)表面抑制了甲基乙炔分解为表面碳的过程。

3. 合金表面大大增加了可逆吸附的甲基乙炔量，从Pt(111)上的零增加到(E3×E3)R30Sn/Pt(111)表面合金上的60%。

4. 增加Pt(111)表面中Sn的浓度改变了TPD过程中H2的脱附温度，表明C-H键断裂过程发生了变化。

这些UHV研究通过提供表面反应、吸附行为以及合金化对催化性能影响的详细见解，有助于我们理解选择性脱氢。这些信息对于优化化学生产和燃料合成中的催化过程至关重要。

然而，需要注意的是，UHV研究在直接代表工业条件方面存在局限性。为了充分优化催化过程，这些基础研究需要与在更真实反应条件下和负载型催化剂上进行的研究相互补充。
