          "TPD results showed that the presence of Au on Pt promoted the selective dehydrogenation of cyclohexene to benzene."

"Cyclohexene has several competitive reaction pathways, including decomposition, dehydrogenation, disproportionation (self-hydrogenation), and hydrogenation."

"Different from Pt, the reaction of cyclohexene on Au/Pt bimetallic surfaces, in particular the 0.5 ML Au/Pt surface, is mainly dehydrogenation; the extent of carbon deposition on 0.5 ML AuPt is also significantly reduced."

"The experiments were carried out in a two-level stainless steel ultra-high vacuum (UHV) chamber with a base pressure of 1 × 1010 Torr, as described previously"

"The UHV system was equipped with a single-pass cylindrical mirror analyzer for Auger electron spectroscopy (AES) characterization and a quadrupole mass spectrometer (QMS) for temperature-programmed desorption (TPD) experiments"

"TPD experiments
After synthesizing the surfaces of interest, hydrogen (Matheson, 99.999%), carbon monoxide (CO) (Matheson, 99.999%), and cyclohexene (c-C6H10) (Aldrich, 99+ %) were dosed with the surface temperature at or below 145 K."

"The TPD spectra were taken from 105 K to 800 K with a linear heating rate of 3 K/s."

          Selective dehydrogenation reactions play a crucial role in chemical production, fuel synthesis, and hydrogen storage due to their ability to produce valuable unsaturated compounds and hydrogen gas. Both reactor studies and Ultra-High Vacuum (UHV) studies contribute significantly to our understanding of these processes, particularly for C-H and N-H bond dehydrogenation over supported catalysts.

UHV studies, as demonstrated in this research, enable the examination of fundamental surface chemistry and reaction mechanisms at the atomic level. The study employs ultra-high vacuum conditions to investigate the reactivity of cyclohexene on Pt and Au/Pt surfaces, allowing for precise control over surface conditions and reactant exposure.

Key research methods and characterization techniques used in this UHV study include:

1. Temperature-Programmed Desorption (TPD): Used to analyze reaction products and their desorption temperatures, providing information on binding energies and reaction pathways. TPD experiments were conducted from 105 K to 800 K with a heating rate of 3 K/s.

2. Auger Electron Spectroscopy (AES): Employed to characterize surface composition and monitor carbon deposition.

3. Mass Spectrometry: Used in conjunction with TPD to identify and quantify reaction products.

4. Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations: Used to predict binding energies of atomic species on different surface configurations.

The study investigates reaction conditions such as:
- Ultra-high vacuum (~10^-10 Torr)
- Temperature range from ~100 K to 800 K 
- Controlled dosing of reactants (cyclohexene, hydrogen, carbon monoxide) at low temperatures (≤145 K)
- Surface composition (Pt vs. Au/Pt)
- The presence of pre-adsorbed hydrogen

These UHV studies inform the optimization of catalytic processes by:
1. Providing fundamental insights into the effect of surface composition on reactivity and selectivity
2. Demonstrating how alloying (e.g., Au on Pt) can promote selective dehydrogenation while inhibiting undesired side reactions like coking
3. Identifying active sites and reaction mechanisms
4. Elucidating the role of promoters or inhibitors in catalytic reactions
5. Providing insights into catalyst deactivation mechanisms

While this study focuses on a model reaction (cyclohexene dehydrogenation) under UHV conditions, the insights gained can be valuable for understanding and optimizing more complex catalytic processes in practical applications. However, bridging the gap between UHV studies and real-world catalytic conditions often requires additional research under more realistic pressures and reaction environments.

          选择性脱氢反应在化学生产、燃料合成和氢气储存方面起着至关重要的作用，因为它们能够生产有价值的不饱和化合物和氢气。反应器研究和超高真空（UHV）研究都对我们理解这些过程做出了重大贡献，特别是对于负载型催化剂上的C-H和N-H键脱氢反应。

UHV研究，如本研究所示，能够在原子水平上检查基础表面化学和反应机理。该研究采用超高真空条件来研究环己烯在Pt和Au/Pt表面上的反应性，允许精确控制表面条件和反应物暴露。

这项UHV研究使用的主要研究方法和表征技术包括：

1. 程序升温脱附（TPD）：用于分析反应产物及其脱附温度，提供有关结合能和反应途径的信息。TPD实验在105 K到800 K的温度范围内进行，升温速率为3 K/s。

2. 俄歇电子能谱（AES）：用于表征表面组成和监测碳沉积。

3. 质谱法：与TPD结合使用，用于识别和量化反应产物。

4. 密度泛函理论（DFT）计算：用于预测不同表面构型上原子物种的结合能。

研究的反应条件包括：
- 超高真空（~10^-10 Torr）
- 温度范围从约100 K到800 K
- 在低温（≤145 K）下对反应物（环己烯、氢气、一氧化碳）进行受控剂量
- 表面组成（Pt vs. Au/Pt）
- 预吸附氢气的存在

这些UHV研究通过以下方式为催化过程的优化提供信息：
1. 提供关于表面组成对反应活性和选择性影响的基础认识
2. 展示合金化（如Pt上的Au）如何促进选择性脱氢，同时抑制不需要的副反应，如结焦
3. 识别活性位点和反应机理
4. 阐明促进剂或抑制剂在催化反应中的作用
5. 提供有关催化剂失活机制的见解

虽然这项研究集中在理想化UHV条件下的模型反应（环己烯脱氢），但获得的见解对于理解和优化实际应用中更复杂的催化过程可能很有价值。然而，要弥合UHV研究和实际催化条件之间的差距，通常需要在更接近真实压力和反应环境下进行额外的研究。
