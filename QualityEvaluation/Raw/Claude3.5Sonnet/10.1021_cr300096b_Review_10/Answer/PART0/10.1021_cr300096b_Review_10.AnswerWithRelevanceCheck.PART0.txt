          [1] "Selective dehydrogenation is important for the production of chemicals and fuels, as well as for hydrogen storage."

[2] "Table 5 summarizes selected reactor studies of dehydrogenation of CH and NH bonds over supported catalysts, including the synthesis methods, characterization techniques, and dehydrogenation temperatures. Selected UHV studies of dehydrogenation reactions are listed in Table 3."

[3] "Ammonia is regarded as an important hydrogen-storage medium in a hydrogen economy due to its facile decomposition to produce hydrogen."

[4] "The dehydration of alkanes is an important part of industrial processes used to produce polymers, ethers, and gasoline. Another potential use of dehydrogenation is to store hydrogen in a chemical with a higher volumetric energy density than hydrogen and to subsequently dehydrogenate the chemical when hydrogen is needed."

[5] "Current high-temperature dehydration processes lead to sintering and rapid deactivation of catalysts, but by modifying Pt catalysts with a second metal, the selectivity, activity, and stability of the catalyst are maintained."

[6] "Reactor studies also show that adding only a small amount of Sn to Pt catalysts improves the dehydrogenation selectivity and reduces the deactivation rate."

[7] "The reforming of gasoline and diesel fuels has been proposed as a short-term option of H2 storage. Gasoline and diesel are both currently available, and using them as a hydrogen carrier instead of direct fuels could achieve some immediate reduction in greenhouse gas emissions."

          Selective dehydrogenation reactions play a crucial role in chemical production, fuel synthesis, and hydrogen storage. Their significance is evident in several areas:

1. Chemical and fuel production: Dehydrogenation is essential for producing various chemicals, polymers, ethers, and high-octane gasoline from lower-value hydrocarbons.

2. Hydrogen storage: Dehydrogenation allows for the storage of hydrogen in chemicals with higher volumetric energy density, such as ammonia and hydrazine, which can be later dehydrogenated to release hydrogen when needed.

3. Environmental impact: Using dehydrogenation to convert gasoline and diesel into hydrogen carriers could lead to immediate reductions in greenhouse gas emissions.

Reactor studies and Ultra-High Vacuum (UHV) studies contribute significantly to our understanding of these processes by:

1. Providing insights into reaction mechanisms and kinetics under different conditions.
2. Allowing for the investigation of catalyst performance, selectivity, and stability.
3. Enabling the study of surface interactions between reactants and catalysts at the molecular level.

Key research methods, characterization techniques, and reaction conditions typically investigated include:

1. Synthesis methods: Impregnation, sol-gel, template synthesis, and reductive deposition.
2. Characterization techniques: TEM, XRD, TPR, TPO, H2 chemisorption, N2 adsorption, XPS, AES, FTIR, and XAS.
3. Reaction conditions: Varying temperatures (typically 300-900 K), flow or batch reactors, and different reactants (e.g., alkanes, ammonia, hydrazine).

These studies inform the optimization of catalytic processes by:

1. Identifying more effective catalyst compositions: For example, bimetallic catalysts like PtSn, PtNi, and PtRe have shown improved performance over monometallic catalysts.
2. Understanding the role of catalyst modifiers: Adding a second metal to Pt catalysts can enhance selectivity, activity, and stability.
3. Optimizing reaction conditions: Studies help determine optimal temperatures and reactor configurations for specific dehydrogenation reactions.
4. Addressing catalyst deactivation: Research has led to the development of catalysts with improved resistance to coking and sintering.
5. Exploring structure-function relationships: UHV studies provide insights into how surface structure affects catalytic performance.

By combining reactor studies with UHV investigations, researchers can develop a comprehensive understanding of dehydrogenation processes, leading to the design of more efficient and stable catalysts for industrial applications in chemical production, fuel synthesis, and hydrogen storage.

          选择性脱氢反应在化学品生产、燃料合成和氢储存方面发挥着至关重要的作用。它们的重要性体现在以下几个方面：

1. 化学品和燃料生产：脱氢反应对于从低价值烃类生产各种化学品、聚合物、醚类和高辛烷值汽油至关重要。

2. 氢储存：脱氢反应允许将氢储存在体积能量密度更高的化学物质中，如氨和肼，在需要时可以通过脱氢反应释放氢气。

3. 环境影响：利用脱氢反应将汽油和柴油转化为氢载体，可以立即减少温室气体排放。

反应器研究和超高真空（UHV）研究对理解这些过程做出了重大贡献：

1. 提供了不同条件下反应机理和动力学的洞察。
2. 允许研究催化剂的性能、选择性和稳定性。
3. 能够在分子水平上研究反应物和催化剂之间的表面相互作用。

通常研究的关键研究方法、表征技术和反应条件包括：

1. 合成方法：浸渍法、溶胶-凝胶法、模板合成法和还原沉积法。
2. 表征技术：TEM、XRD、TPR、TPO、H2化学吸附、N2吸附、XPS、AES、FTIR和XAS。
3. 反应条件：不同温度（通常300-900 K）、流动或批次反应器，以及不同的反应物（如烷烃、氨、肼）。

这些研究通过以下方式指导催化过程的优化：

1. 确定更有效的催化剂组成：例如，PtSn、PtNi和PtRe等双金属催化剂表现出比单金属催化剂更好的性能。
2. 理解催化剂改性剂的作用：向Pt催化剂中添加第二种金属可以提高选择性、活性和稳定性。
3. 优化反应条件：研究有助于确定特定脱氢反应的最佳温度和反应器配置。
4. 解决催化剂失活问题：研究导致了抗积炭和烧结能力更强的催化剂的开发。
5. 探索结构-功能关系：UHV研究提供了表面结构如何影响催化性能的见解。

通过将反应器研究与UHV研究相结合，研究人员可以全面理解脱氢过程，从而设计出更高效、更稳定的工业应用催化剂，用于化学品生产、燃料合成和氢储存。
