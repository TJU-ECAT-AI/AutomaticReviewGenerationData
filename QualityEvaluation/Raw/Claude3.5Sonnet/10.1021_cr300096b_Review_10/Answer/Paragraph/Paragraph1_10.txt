Selective dehydrogenation reactions play a crucial role in various industrial processes, including chemical production, fuel synthesis, and hydrogen storage. These reactions, particularly those involving C-H and N-H bond dehydrogenation over supported catalysts, have garnered significant attention due to their potential to improve efficiency and sustainability in numerous applications. Researchers employ a combination of reactor studies and ultra-high vacuum (UHV) techniques to investigate the fundamental mechanisms and optimize catalyst performance. Reactor studies provide insights into real-world reaction conditions, while UHV experiments allow for precise control and analysis of surface interactions at the atomic level. The significance of these reactions lies in their ability to produce valuable chemicals, such as alkenes and aromatics, from abundant feedstocks while potentially serving as a means for hydrogen storage and release. As the demand for cleaner energy sources and more sustainable chemical processes grows, understanding and improving selective dehydrogenation reactions becomes increasingly important for developing next-generation catalysts and reaction systems.
