[1] "The hydrogenation and dehydrogenation of cyclic hydrocarbons offer the possibility of using these molecules as organic hydrogen storage materials. However, this application requires active catalysts for low-temperature hydrogenation and dehydrogenation reactions."

[2] "Many investigations have combined fundamental surface science studies and theoretical calculations with the goal of correlating the electronic and catalytic properties of bimetallic surfaces [511]."

[3] "Both experimental and theoretical investigations have revealed that the Ni-Pt-Pt surface binds adsorbates more strongly than either Pt or Ni surfaces alone. The strong binding on the Ni-Pt-Pt surface structure leads to the facile production of H2 from the dehydrogenation of oxygenates [12] and ammonia [13]."

[4] "To correlate hydrogenation and dehydrogenation activities with binding energy, Table 2 and Fig. 3 show the results of the DFT calculations for 1,3-CHD on closed-packed surfaces of Pt(111) and Ni(111)."

[5] "The catalytic activities of 1,3-CHD hydrogenation and dehydrogenation for these three catalysts were evaluated using a batch reactor with FT-IR."

Selective dehydrogenation reactions play a crucial role in chemical production, fuel synthesis, and hydrogen storage. This significance is highlighted by the potential use of cyclic hydrocarbons as organic hydrogen storage materials, which requires efficient catalysts for low-temperature hydrogenation and dehydrogenation reactions.

Reactor studies and Ultra-High Vacuum (UHV) studies contribute significantly to our understanding of these processes, particularly for C-H and N-H bond dehydrogenation over supported catalysts. These studies provide complementary information:

1. Reactor studies: These involve evaluating catalytic activities under realistic reaction conditions. For instance, the literature mentions using a batch reactor with Fourier Transform Infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy to study the hydrogenation and dehydrogenation of 1,3-cyclohexadiene (1,3-CHD) over different catalysts. This approach allows researchers to monitor reaction progress and product formation in real-time.

2. UHV studies: While not explicitly mentioned in the given literature, UHV studies typically involve surface science techniques that provide atomic-level insights into catalyst surfaces and adsorbate interactions. These studies are often conducted under highly controlled conditions to isolate specific surface phenomena.

Key research methods and characterization techniques typically investigated include:

1. Catalyst preparation: Methods like incipient wetness impregnation for supported catalysts.
2. Catalyst characterization: Techniques such as CO chemisorption to determine the number of active sites.
3. Activity measurements: Using batch reactors or flow reactors coupled with analytical techniques like FT-IR.
4. Theoretical calculations: Density Functional Theory (DFT) to model adsorbate binding energies and surface structures.

Reaction conditions typically investigated include low temperatures (e.g., 308 K in the given study), various catalyst compositions (monometallic vs. bimetallic), and different reactant ratios.

These studies inform the optimization of catalytic processes by:

1. Identifying active catalyst structures: For example, the literature discusses the role of subsurface Pt-Ni-Pt and surface Ni-Pt-Pt structures in promoting hydrogenation and dehydrogenation, respectively.
2. Understanding structure-activity relationships: Correlating binding energies calculated from DFT with experimental reaction rates.
3. Elucidating reaction mechanisms: Combining experimental observations with theoretical calculations to propose reaction pathways.
4. Guiding catalyst design: Using insights from both experimental and theoretical studies to develop catalysts with desired properties for specific reactions.

By integrating reactor studies, UHV investigations, and theoretical calculations, researchers can gain a comprehensive understanding of dehydrogenation processes, leading to the development of more efficient and selective catalysts for various applications in chemical production, fuel synthesis, and hydrogen storage.

选择性脱氢反应在化学生产、燃料合成和氢储存中扮演着至关重要的角色。这一重要性体现在环状碳氢化合物可能被用作有机氢储存材料，这需要高效的低温氢化和脱氢反应催化剂。

反应器研究和超高真空（UHV）研究对理解这些过程，特别是负载型催化剂上C-H和N-H键脱氢过程，做出了重要贡献。这些研究提供了互补的信息：

1. 反应器研究：这涉及在实际反应条件下评估催化活性。例如，文献中提到使用配备傅里叶变换红外（FT-IR）光谱仪的批量反应器来研究不同催化剂上1,3-环己二烯（1,3-CHD）的氢化和脱氢反应。这种方法允许研究人员实时监测反应进程和产物形成。

2. UHV研究：虽然在给定的文献中没有明确提到，但UHV研究通常涉及提供催化剂表面和吸附质相互作用的原子级洞察的表面科学技术。这些研究通常在高度受控的条件下进行，以分离特定的表面现象。

通常研究的关键研究方法和表征技术包括：

1. 催化剂制备：如用于负载型催化剂的浸渍法。
2. 催化剂表征：如CO化学吸附技术，用于确定活性位点数量。
3. 活性测量：使用批量反应器或流动反应器，结合FT-IR等分析技术。
4. 理论计算：使用密度泛函理论（DFT）来模拟吸附质结合能和表面结构。

通常研究的反应条件包括低温（如给定研究中的308 K），各种催化剂组成（单金属vs双金属），以及不同的反应物比例。

这些研究通过以下方式指导催化过程的优化：

1. 识别活性催化剂结构：例如，文献讨论了亚表面Pt-Ni-Pt和表面Ni-Pt-Pt结构在促进氢化和脱氢反应中的作用。
2. 理解结构-活性关系：将DFT计算的结合能与实验反应速率相关联。
3. 阐明反应机理：结合实验观察和理论计算来提出反应途径。
4. 指导催化剂设计：利用实验和理论研究的见解来开发具有特定反应所需性质的催化剂。

通过整合反应器研究、UHV调查和理论计算，研究人员可以全面理解脱氢过程，从而开发出更高效、更具选择性的催化剂，用于化学生产、燃料合成和氢储存等各种应用。
