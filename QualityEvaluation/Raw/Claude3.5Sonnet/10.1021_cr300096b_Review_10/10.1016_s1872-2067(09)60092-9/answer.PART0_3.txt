[1] "Hydrogen is regarded as an ideal energy carrier because of its pollution-free and conversion efficiency characteristics and these are some of the reasons that it is used in fuel cells. The storage, transportation, and distribution of hydrogen are receiving an increasing amount of attention [1,2]. The hydrogenation and dehydrogenation of cyclic hydrocarbons offer the possibility of using these molecules as organic hydrogen storage materials."

[2] "Many investigations have combined fundamental surface science studies and theoretical calculations with the goal of correlating the electronic and catalytic properties of bimetallic surfaces [511]."

[3] "In this work, we used 1,3-cyclohexadiene (CHD), an intermediate in C6 cyclic hydrocarbon conversion, as a probe molecule to investigate the effect of bimetallic formation on hydrogenation and dehydrogenation activities."

[4] "The catalytic activities of 1,3-CHD hydrogenation and dehydrogenation for these three catalysts were evaluated using a batch reactor with FT-IR. The concentrations of the four main gas-phase species, 1,3-CHD, cyclohexene, cyclohexane, and benzene, were determined using the intensities of the vibrational features at 1 700, 1 139, 1 458, and 1 810 cm1, respectively."

[5] "To correlate hydrogenation and dehydrogenation activities with binding energy, Table 2 and Fig. 3 show the results of the DFT calculations for 1,3-CHD on closed-packed surfaces of Pt(111) and Ni(111)."

Selective dehydrogenation reactions are significant in chemical production, fuel synthesis, and hydrogen storage. The literature highlights the importance of these reactions, particularly in the context of using cyclic hydrocarbons as organic hydrogen storage materials. This is crucial for addressing the challenges of hydrogen storage, transportation, and distribution in the development of clean energy technologies like fuel cells.

Reactor studies and Ultra-High Vacuum (UHV) studies contribute to our understanding of these processes in complementary ways:

1. Reactor studies: The literature describes using a batch reactor with FT-IR to evaluate the catalytic activities of 1,3-cyclohexadiene (CHD) hydrogenation and dehydrogenation. This approach allows for the investigation of reaction kinetics and product distribution under more realistic conditions, closer to those used in industrial applications.

2. UHV studies: While not explicitly mentioned in the given text, UHV studies typically provide insights into the fundamental surface science aspects of catalysis. They allow for precise control of surface composition and structure, enabling the study of elementary reaction steps and adsorbate-surface interactions.

Key research methods and characterization techniques mentioned in the literature include:

1. Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FT-IR): Used to monitor the concentrations of reactants and products in the gas phase.
2. CO chemisorption: Employed to quantify the number of active sites on the catalyst surface.
3. Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations: Used to model the binding energies of reactants on various catalyst surfaces.

Typical reaction conditions investigated include low-temperature reactions (308 K in this study) and the use of supported catalysts (γ-Al2O3 supported Pt, Ni, and Pt-Ni catalysts).

These studies inform the optimization of catalytic processes by:

1. Correlating catalyst structure with activity: The research compares monometallic and bimetallic catalysts, revealing that the Pt-Ni bimetallic catalyst shows higher activity for both hydrogenation and dehydrogenation.
2. Understanding the role of electronic properties: DFT calculations help explain how the electronic structure of bimetallic surfaces influences binding energies and, consequently, catalytic activity.
3. Identifying structure-activity relationships: The study relates the subsurface Pt-Ni-Pt structure to enhanced hydrogenation activity and the Ni-Pt-Pt surface structure to improved dehydrogenation performance.

By combining reactor studies, surface science techniques, and theoretical calculations, researchers can develop a comprehensive understanding of catalytic processes, leading to the design of more efficient and selective catalysts for dehydrogenation reactions in various applications.
