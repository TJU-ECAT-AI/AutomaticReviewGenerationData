[1] "Hydrogen is regarded as an ideal energy carrier because of its pollution-free and conversion efficiency characteristics and these are some of the reasons that it is used in fuel cells. The storage, transportation, and distribution of hydrogen are receiving an increasing amount of attention [1,2]. The hydrogenation and dehydrogenation of cyclic hydrocarbons offer the possibility of using these molecules as organic hydrogen storage materials."

[2] "Many investigations have combined fundamental surface science studies and theoretical calculations with the goal of correlating the electronic and catalytic properties of bimetallic surfaces [511]."

[3] "The strong binding on the Ni-Pt-Pt surface structure leads to the facile production of H2 from the dehydrogenation of oxygenates [12] and ammonia [13]."

[4] "Herein, we compare the hydrogenation and dehydrogenation activities of 1,3-CHD over the Pt-Ni/γ-Al2O3 bimetallic with the corresponding monometallic Pt and Ni catalysts using a batch reactor equipped with a Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectrometer."

[5] "The catalytic activities of 1,3-CHD hydrogenation and dehydrogenation for these three catalysts were evaluated using a batch reactor with FT-IR. The concentrations of the four main gas-phase species, 1,3-CHD, cyclohexene, cyclohexane, and benzene, were determined using the intensities of the vibrational features at 1 700, 1 139, 1 458, and 1 810 cm1, respectively."

Selective dehydrogenation reactions are significant in chemical production, fuel synthesis, and hydrogen storage. The literature highlights the importance of these reactions, particularly in the context of using cyclic hydrocarbons as organic hydrogen storage materials. This is crucial for the development of clean energy technologies, such as fuel cells.

Reactor studies and UHV (Ultra-High Vacuum) studies contribute significantly to our understanding of these processes. Reactor studies, as demonstrated in this paper, allow for the evaluation of catalytic activities under realistic conditions. The use of a batch reactor equipped with FT-IR spectroscopy enables real-time monitoring of reaction progress and product formation. This provides insights into reaction kinetics and mechanisms under practical operating conditions.

UHV studies, while not explicitly detailed in this paper, are often used in conjunction with reactor studies to provide fundamental insights into surface reactions. They allow for precise control of surface composition and the study of elementary reaction steps. The paper mentions that many investigations have combined surface science studies with theoretical calculations to correlate electronic and catalytic properties of bimetallic surfaces.

Key research methods in this field include:
1. Catalyst preparation techniques (e.g., incipient wetness impregnation)
2. Catalyst characterization (e.g., CO chemisorption)
3. Reactor studies (e.g., batch reactor with FT-IR)
4. Theoretical calculations (e.g., DFT)

Characterization techniques typically include:
1. FT-IR spectroscopy for monitoring gas-phase species
2. CO chemisorption for determining the number of active sites
3. DFT calculations for predicting binding energies and surface structures

Reaction conditions investigated often include:
1. Temperature (e.g., low-temperature reactions at 308 K in this study)
2. Pressure (e.g., 3999 Pa in this study)
3. Feed composition (e.g., C6H8:H2:He = 1:4:5 in this study)
4. Catalyst composition (e.g., monometallic vs. bimetallic catalysts)

These studies inform the optimization of catalytic processes by:
1. Identifying more active catalyst compositions (e.g., Pt-Ni bimetallic vs. monometallic catalysts)
2. Understanding the relationship between surface structure and catalytic activity
3. Correlating binding energies with reaction rates
4. Elucidating reaction mechanisms and pathways

The combination of experimental results and theoretical calculations allows for a deeper understanding of the factors controlling catalytic activity and selectivity. This knowledge can be used to design more efficient catalysts for selective dehydrogenation reactions, ultimately leading to improved processes for chemical production, fuel synthesis, and hydrogen storage.
