          [1] "The hydrogenation and dehydrogenation of cyclic hydrocarbons offer the possibility of using these molecules as organic hydrogen storage materials."

[2] "Both experimental and theoretical investigations have revealed that the Ni-Pt-Pt surface binds adsorbates more strongly than either Pt or Ni surfaces alone. The strong binding on the Ni-Pt-Pt surface structure leads to the facile production of H2 from the dehydrogenation of oxygenates [12] and ammonia [13]."

[3] "To correlate hydrogenation and dehydrogenation activities with binding energy, Table 2 and Fig. 3 show the results of the DFT calculations for 1,3-CHD on closed-packed surfaces of Pt(111) and Ni(111)."

[4] "The DFT calculations were performed using the Vienna ab-initio simulations package (VASP) with spin polarization. A 3×3 slab with four metal layers was used to model the adsorption of 1,3-CHD (1 adsorbate per unit cell)."

[5] "Another interesting observation in Table 2 is that the binding energies of 1,3-CHD and atomic hydrogen are higher on the Ni-Pt-Pt(111) surface than on either Pt(111) or Ni(111) suggesting that the Ni-Pt-Pt surface structure should be more thermodynamically favored than the parent metals for the dehydrogenation reaction."

[6] "Hydrogen is regarded as an ideal energy carrier because of its pollution-free and conversion efficiency characteristics and these are some of the reasons that it is used in fuel cells. The storage, transportation, and distribution of hydrogen are receiving an increasing amount of attention [1,2]. The hydrogenation and dehydrogenation of cyclic hydrocarbons offer the possibility of using these molecules as organic hydrogen storage materials."

[7] "Many investigations have combined fundamental surface science studies and theoretical calculations with the goal of correlating the electronic and catalytic properties of bimetallic surfaces [511]."

[8] "Herein, we compare the hydrogenation and dehydrogenation activities of 1,3-CHD over the Pt-Ni/γ-Al2O3 bimetallic with the corresponding monometallic Pt and Ni catalysts using a batch reactor equipped with a Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectrometer."

[9] "The catalytic activities of 1,3-CHD hydrogenation and dehydrogenation for these three catalysts were evaluated using a batch reactor with FT-IR. The concentrations of the four main gas-phase species, 1,3-CHD, cyclohexene, cyclohexane, and benzene, were determined using the intensities of the vibrational features at 1 700, 1 139, 1 458, and 1 810 cm1, respectively."

[10] "Results from this study identify the critical requirements to synthesize supported bimetallic catalysts with uniform and stable Pt-Ni-Pt or Ni-Pt-Pt structures and to control the low temperature hydrogenation or dehydrogenation of cycloalkenes."

[11] "In this work, we used 1,3-cyclohexadiene (CHD), an intermediate in C6 cyclic hydrocarbon conversion, as a probe molecule to investigate the effect of bimetallic formation on hydrogenation and dehydrogenation activities."

[12] "Previous studies have confirmed that closed-packed monometallic and bimetallic surfaces are valid model systems to compare trends in binding energies [5,8]."

          Selective dehydrogenation reactions play a crucial role in chemical production, fuel synthesis, and hydrogen storage. The significance of these reactions lies in their potential to use cyclic hydrocarbons as organic hydrogen storage materials, offering a promising solution for hydrogen economy challenges. This is particularly important for addressing issues related to hydrogen storage, transportation, and distribution in the development of clean energy technologies like fuel cells.

Reactor studies and Ultra-High Vacuum (UHV) studies contribute significantly to our understanding of dehydrogenation processes, particularly C-H and N-H bond dehydrogenation over supported catalysts. These studies provide complementary insights:

1. Reactor studies: These investigate catalytic performance under more realistic conditions, allowing researchers to evaluate catalyst activity, selectivity, and stability. They help in understanding the behavior of supported catalysts in practical applications. For example, the literature describes using a batch reactor with FT-IR to evaluate the catalytic activities of 1,3-cyclohexadiene (CHD) hydrogenation and dehydrogenation.

2. UHV studies: While not explicitly detailed in the given quotes, UHV studies typically provide fundamental insights into surface reactions and adsorbate-substrate interactions at the atomic level. They allow for precise control of surface composition and structure, which is crucial for understanding the intrinsic properties of catalysts.

Key research methods and characterization techniques typically employed include:

1. Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations: Used to predict binding energies and optimize adsorbate configurations on catalyst surfaces. The Vienna ab-initio simulations package (VASP) is mentioned as a tool for these calculations.

2. CO chemisorption: Employed to quantify the number of active sites on catalyst surfaces.

3. Fourier Transform Infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy: Used to analyze reaction intermediates and products in situ. The concentrations of gas-phase species were determined using the intensities of specific vibrational features.

4. Batch reactor studies: Utilized to evaluate catalyst performance under controlled conditions.

Reaction conditions typically investigated include low temperatures (e.g., 308 K in this study) and varying pressures. The focus is often on comparing monometallic and bimetallic catalysts to understand the synergistic effects in bimetallic systems, particularly the performance of Pt-Ni bimetallic catalysts compared to monometallic Pt and Ni catalysts.

These studies inform the optimization of catalytic processes by:

1. Elucidating structure-activity relationships: Correlating catalyst structure with performance helps in designing more efficient catalysts. For example, the research identifies the critical requirements to synthesize supported bimetallic catalysts with uniform and stable Pt-Ni-Pt or Ni-Pt-Pt structures.

2. Understanding reaction mechanisms: Identifying rate-determining steps and intermediates guides process optimization.

3. Predicting catalyst behavior: DFT calculations can be used to screen potential catalyst compositions before experimental testing. The study shows that the Ni-Pt-Pt surface structure has higher binding energies for both 1,3-CHD and atomic hydrogen, suggesting it should be more thermodynamically favored for dehydrogenation reactions.

4. Optimizing reaction conditions: Reactor studies help in determining optimal temperature, pressure, and reactant ratios for desired products.

The combination of experimental results and theoretical calculations allows for a deeper understanding of the factors controlling catalytic activity and selectivity. This knowledge is critical for developing more efficient and selective catalysts for dehydrogenation reactions, which could lead to improved hydrogen storage technologies and more sustainable chemical production processes.

3. 预测催化剂行为：DFT计算可用于在实验测试之前筛选潜在的催化剂组成。研究表明，Ni-Pt-Pt表面结构对1,3-CHD和原子氢都具有更高的结合能，这表明它在脱氢反应中应该更具热力学优势。

4. 优化反应条件：反应器研究有助于确定所需产品的最佳温度、压力和反应物比例。

实验结果和理论计算的结合允许更深入地理解控制催化活性和选择性的因素。这些知识对于开发更高效和选择性的脱氢反应催化剂至关重要，这可能导致改进的氢储存技术和更可持续的化学生产过程。
