[1] "The hydrogenation and dehydrogenation of cyclic hydrocarbons offer the possibility of using these molecules as organic hydrogen storage materials."

[2] "Both experimental and theoretical investigations have revealed that the Ni-Pt-Pt surface binds adsorbates more strongly than either Pt or Ni surfaces alone. The strong binding on the Ni-Pt-Pt surface structure leads to the facile production of H2 from the dehydrogenation of oxygenates [12] and ammonia [13]."

[3] "To correlate hydrogenation and dehydrogenation activities with binding energy, Table 2 and Fig. 3 show the results of the DFT calculations for 1,3-CHD on closed-packed surfaces of Pt(111) and Ni(111)."

[4] "The DFT calculations were performed using the Vienna ab-initio simulations package (VASP) with spin polarization. A 3×3 slab with four metal layers was used to model the adsorption of 1,3-CHD (1 adsorbate per unit cell)."

[5] "Another interesting observation in Table 2 is that the binding energies of 1,3-CHD and atomic hydrogen are higher on the Ni-Pt-Pt(111) surface than on either Pt(111) or Ni(111) suggesting that the Ni-Pt-Pt surface structure should be more thermodynamically favored than the parent metals for the dehydrogenation reaction."

Selective dehydrogenation reactions play a crucial role in chemical production, fuel synthesis, and hydrogen storage. The document highlights the importance of these reactions, particularly in the context of using cyclic hydrocarbons as organic hydrogen storage materials. This application is significant as it addresses the growing need for efficient hydrogen storage solutions in the renewable energy sector.

The research methods employed in this field combine both reactor studies and theoretical calculations, particularly density functional theory (DFT). Reactor studies, such as those conducted in batch reactors with FT-IR spectroscopy, provide practical insights into catalyst performance under realistic conditions. These studies allow researchers to measure reaction rates, product distributions, and catalyst stability.

Ultra-High Vacuum (UHV) studies, while not explicitly mentioned in this document, are often used in conjunction with reactor studies to provide fundamental insights into surface reactions. UHV conditions allow for precise control of surface composition and adsorbate coverage, enabling researchers to study elementary reaction steps and identify active sites.

The document emphasizes the use of DFT calculations to model adsorbate binding energies on various metal surfaces. This theoretical approach complements experimental studies by providing atomic-level insights into reaction mechanisms and helping to predict catalytic trends. The Vienna ab-initio simulations package (VASP) is specifically mentioned as a tool for these calculations.

Characterization techniques mentioned in the document include CO chemisorption for measuring the number of active sites on catalysts, and Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy for analyzing reaction products and surface species. These techniques are crucial for understanding catalyst structure-activity relationships.

The reaction conditions investigated typically involve low temperatures (e.g., 308 K in this study) and atmospheric pressure. The use of model compounds, such as 1,3-cyclohexadiene, allows researchers to study specific reaction pathways and compare different catalyst formulations.

The combination of reactor studies, theoretical calculations, and surface characterization techniques informs the optimization of catalytic processes by:

1. Identifying promising catalyst compositions (e.g., Pt-Ni bimetallic catalysts)
2. Elucidating the role of surface structure in determining catalytic activity
3. Correlating binding energies with reaction rates to predict catalytic trends
4. Understanding the competition between hydrogenation and dehydrogenation pathways

The study of C-H and N-H bond dehydrogenation over supported catalysts is particularly relevant for hydrogen storage applications. The document mentions the dehydrogenation of oxygenates and ammonia as examples of reactions facilitated by specific surface structures (Ni-Pt-Pt).

Overall, these studies contribute to our understanding of dehydrogenation processes by revealing the complex interplay between surface structure, electronic properties, and catalytic activity. This knowledge is essential for designing more efficient and selective catalysts for chemical production, fuel synthesis, and hydrogen storage applications.
