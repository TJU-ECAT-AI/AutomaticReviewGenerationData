Dehydrogenation of cyclohexane to benzene has been carried out over Ni supported on activated carbon cloth ACC (Ni/ACC) catalysts under spray-pulsed mode reactor to study hydrogen evolution for hydrogen storage and supply system applications. The maximum rate of hydrogen evolution using monometallic Ni/ACC catalysts was 8.5 mmol  g−1cat min−1 for Ni loading of 20% by weight. A small amount of Pt (0.5 wt%) was added to the Ni based catalysts. A synergistic effect was observed in the case of the promoted catalysts the hydrogen production was enhanced by ca. 1.5 times as compared to the 20 wt% Ni only catalyst. As compared to 0.5 wt% monometallic Pt catalyst, the 20 wt% Ni–0.5 wt% Pt bimetallic catalyst exhibits ca. 60 times higher hydrogen production rates. Selectivity towards dehydrogenation observed to be enhanced by addition of Pt into Ni/ACC catalysts.
