The given scientific literature does not contain information directly relevant to answering this question about selective dehydrogenation reactions, their applications, and research methods. The document focuses on the adsorption of cyclopentene on platinum and platinum-tin alloy surfaces, which is not closely related to the topics mentioned in the question. Therefore, I cannot provide a meaningful answer based solely on the content of this document.
