The given literature does not contain information directly relevant to answering the question about selective dehydrogenation reactions, their significance in various industries, or comparisons between reactor studies and UHV studies. The document focuses on PtSn catalysts for isobutane dehydrogenation, but does not provide a broader discussion of dehydrogenation processes or research methods as requested in the question. The literature does not address C-H and N-H bond dehydrogenation specifically, nor does it compare reactor and UHV studies. Therefore, this question cannot be adequately answered based solely on the provided text.

所提供的文献并不包含直接相关的信息来回答关于选择性脱氢反应、它们在各行业中的重要性,或反应器研究与超高真空研究之间比较的问题。该文档主要关注异丁烷脱氢的PtSn催化剂,但没有提供问题所要求的关于脱氢过程或研究方法的更广泛讨论。文献没有具体讨论C-H和N-H键的脱氢,也没有比较反应器和超高真空研究。因此,仅基于所提供的文本无法充分回答这个问题。
