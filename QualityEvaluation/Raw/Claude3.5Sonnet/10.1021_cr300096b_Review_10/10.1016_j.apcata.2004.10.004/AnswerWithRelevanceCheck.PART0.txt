          [1] "Light olefins are widely employed in industry, as they are involved in processes such as production of polymers, ethers, nitriles, new gasolines, etc. Most of these olefins are obtained as by-products of both thermal and catalytic cracking processes, and so, the volume of gasoline required by the market determines the availability of olefins."

[2] "The dehydrogenation of light paraffins to olefins is an endothermic reaction; that it is why it requires the application of relatively severe operation conditions (temperature above 500 8C in the case of isobutane)."

[3] "Pt/g-Al2O3 catalysts are active in the paraffins dehydrogenation process, but they deactivate very quickly and have a poor selectivity towards olefins, mainly caused by the existence of cracking and isomerization reactions."

[4] "The addition of tin to Pt/g-Al2O3 catalysts notably increases the stability and selectivity for dehydrogenation of paraffins to olefins, inhibiting cracking and isomerization reactions and coke formation process"

[5] "As a test method, the catalysts studied in this work were submitted to the dehydrogenation reaction of isobutane to isobutene."

          The literature provides some relevant information about dehydrogenation reactions and catalysts, though it does not directly address all aspects of the question. Selective dehydrogenation reactions are significant in chemical production, particularly in the production of light olefins used for making polymers, ethers, nitriles, and new gasolines. The dehydrogenation of light paraffins to olefins is an important process but faces challenges due to its endothermic nature and the need for severe operating conditions (temperatures above 500°C for isobutane).

The study focuses on supported catalysts, particularly Pt/g-Al2O3 and PtSn/g-Al2O3, for the dehydrogenation of isobutane to isobutene. Research methods include catalyst preparation techniques such as surface organometallic chemistry on metals (SOMC/M), and characterization techniques like TEM, XPS, and EXAFS.

Key findings include:
1. Pt/g-Al2O3 catalysts are active but suffer from rapid deactivation and poor selectivity due to cracking and isomerization reactions.
2. Adding tin to Pt/g-Al2O3 catalysts significantly improves stability and selectivity, inhibiting undesirable side reactions and coke formation.

These findings contribute to catalytic process optimization by highlighting the importance of bimetallic catalysts and promoters like tin in improving performance. The study demonstrates how detailed characterization of catalyst structure and composition can inform the design of more effective and stable catalysts for dehydrogenation reactions.

While the study doesn't directly address C-H and N-H bond dehydrogenation or compare reactor studies with UHV studies, it provides valuable insights into the challenges and approaches in catalytic dehydrogenation research, relevant to the broader field of selective dehydrogenation reactions.

          虽然文献没有直接回答问题的所有方面，但它确实提供了一些关于脱氢反应和催化剂的相关信息。选择性脱氢反应在化学生产中具有重要意义，特别是在生产用于制造聚合物、醚类、腈类和新型汽油的轻烯烃方面。轻烷烃脱氢制烯烃是一个重要的过程，但由于其吸热性质和需要严苛的操作条件（异丁烷需要500°C以上的温度）而面临挑战。

该研究主要关注负载型催化剂，特别是Pt/g-Al2O3和PtSn/g-Al2O3催化剂，用于异丁烷脱氢制异丁烯。研究方法包括催化剂制备技术，如金属表面有机金属化学（SOMC/M），以及TEM、XPS和EXAFS等表征技术。

主要发现包括：
1. Pt/g-Al2O3催化剂具有活性，但由于裂化和异构化反应而导致快速失活和选择性差。
2. 向Pt/g-Al2O3催化剂中添加锡显著提高了稳定性和选择性，抑制了不良副反应和积炭形成。

这些发现通过强调双金属催化剂和锡等助剂在改善性能方面的重要性，为优化催化过程做出了贡献。该研究表明，对催化剂结构和组成的详细表征如何能够指导设计更有效和更稳定的脱氢反应催化剂。

虽然该研究没有直接涉及C-H和N-H键脱氢或比较反应器研究和超高真空研究，但它为催化脱氢研究中的挑战和方法提供了宝贵的见解，这些见解与选择性脱氢反应的广泛领域相关。
