2. 表征技术：TEM、XRD、TPR、TPO、H2化学吸附、XPS、FTIR和XAS经常用于分析催化剂性质。

3. 反应条件：研究通常考察各种温度（通常范围从298 K到873 K），不同的反应器类型（流动、批次），以及各种反应物（如丙烷、环己烷、氨）。

这些研究通过以下方式为催化过程的优化提供信息：

1. 确定最佳催化剂组成：例如，研究表明PtSn、PtNi和PtRe催化剂在各种脱氢反应中表现出improved性能。

2. 了解失活机理：研究揭示了碳沉积和烧结如何影响催化剂性能，从而制定提高催化剂稳定性的策略。

3. 阐明结构-活性关系：结合理论（如DFT）和实验方法有助于理解催化剂结构如何影响反应活性。

4. 开发新型合成方法：研究已经导致了创新的催化剂制备技术，例如使用聚丙烯酸模板控制Pt纳米粒子的形貌。

总之，反应器和UHV研究为脱氢过程提供了关键见解，使得在化学品生产、燃料合成和氢储存应用中能够开发出更高效、更稳定的催化剂。
