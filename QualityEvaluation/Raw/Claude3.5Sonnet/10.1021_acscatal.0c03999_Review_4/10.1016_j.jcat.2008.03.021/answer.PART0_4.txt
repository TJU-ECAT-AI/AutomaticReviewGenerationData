[1] "No diffraction lines assigned to other polymorphs of Ga2O3 were observed for all mixed Ga2O3Al2O3 oxide samples, although several phases of gallium oxide (e.g., α-, β-, and δ-Ga2O3) are known to be present depending on the treatment conditions"

[2] "All of the samples exhibited two desorption peaks: a broad peak at 393623 K and a smaller peak at 673800 K, corresponding to acid sites of weak and medium strength, respectively"

[3] "This demonstrates that despite its lower Ga2O3 content, a γ -Ga2O3Al2O3 solid solution with suitable composition can be even more active than bulk γ -Ga2O3."

[4] "Whereas the variation of surface weak acid site density demonstrated excellent correlation with the corresponding propane conversion rates, a negative correlation was identified between activity and medium-strong acid site density."

[5] "This indicates that weak surface acidity (specifically, weak Lewis acid site density of the surface), not medium-strong surface acidity, is crucial to achieving high activity and stability."

The literature does not provide a comprehensive comparison of different Ga2O3 polymorphs (α-, β-, γ-, and δ-) in CO2-ODHP reactions. However, it does offer some insights into the catalytic performance of γ-Ga2O3 and Ga2O3-Al2O3 solid solutions:

1. The study focuses primarily on γ-Ga2O3 and Ga2O3-Al2O3 solid solutions, with no direct comparison to other Ga2O3 polymorphs.

2. Surface acidity plays a crucial role in catalytic performance. The catalysts exhibit both weak and medium-strong acid sites, with weak acid sites being more important for activity and stability.

3. The density of weak Lewis acid sites on the surface correlates positively with propane conversion rates, while medium-strong acid sites show a negative correlation.

4. γ-Ga2O3-Al2O3 solid solutions with suitable compositions can be more active than bulk γ-Ga2O3, despite having lower Ga2O3 content. This suggests that the interaction between Ga2O3 and Al2O3 in the solid solution enhances catalytic performance.

5. The study does not provide detailed mechanisms for the observed activity trends and selectivity during initial and steady-state stages of the reaction.

6. The research does not specifically address CO2-ODHP reactions, but rather focuses on propane dehydrogenation in the presence or absence of CO2.

In conclusion, while the study provides valuable insights into the role of surface acidity and Lewis acid sites in γ-Ga2O3 and Ga2O3-Al2O3 solid solutions for propane dehydrogenation, it does not offer a comprehensive comparison of different Ga2O3 polymorphs or detailed mechanistic explanations for CO2-ODHP reactions.

该文献并未提供不同Ga2O3多晶型(α-、β-、γ-和δ-)在CO2-ODHP反应中的全面比较。然而，它确实对γ-Ga2O3和Ga2O3-Al2O3固溶体的催化性能提供了一些见解：

1. 该研究主要集中在γ-Ga2O3和Ga2O3-Al2O3固溶体上，没有与其他Ga2O3多晶型进行直接比较。

2. 表面酸性在催化性能中起着至关重要的作用。催化剂表现出弱酸性和中强酸性位点，其中弱酸性位点对活性和稳定性更为重要。

3. 表面弱Lewis酸位点的密度与丙烷转化率呈正相关，而中强酸性位点则呈负相关。

4. 具有适当组成的γ-Ga2O3-Al2O3固溶体可能比纯γ-Ga2O3更活跃，尽管其Ga2O3含量较低。这表明Ga2O3和Al2O3在固溶体中的相互作用增强了催化性能。

5. 该研究没有提供反应初始阶段和稳态阶段观察到的活性趋势和选择性的详细机理。

6. 该研究并不特别针对CO2-ODHP反应，而是集中在有无CO2存在下的丙烷脱氢反应。

总之，虽然该研究为γ-Ga2O3和Ga2O3-Al2O3固溶体在丙烷脱氢反应中表面酸性和Lewis酸位点的作用提供了有价值的见解，但它并没有提供不同Ga2O3多晶型的全面比较或CO2-ODHP反应的详细机理解释。
