[1] "No diffraction lines assigned to other polymorphs of Ga2O3 were observed for all mixed Ga2O3Al2O3 oxide samples, although several phases of gallium oxide (e.g., α-, β-, and δ-Ga2O3) are known to be present depending on the treatment conditions"

[2] "The 71Ga MAS NMR chemical shift is known to reflect the coordination state of the Ga3+ ion in oxide compounds"

[3] "With increasing aluminum content, a progressively increasing intensity of the line due to the tetrahedral Ga3+ ion (180 ppm) was observed for the GaxAl10xO15 samples, as opposed to the trend for the octahedral Ga3+ ion (10 ppm)."

[4] "The weak acid site density for the galliaalumina mixed oxides is an approximately linear function of the tetrahedral Ga3+ population. This result, in conjunction with much higher population of weak acid sites relative to medium sites, suggests the essential role of tetrahedral surface Ga3+ sites in creating the surface acidity of the mixed oxides"

[5] "Whereas the variation of surface weak acid site density demonstrated excellent correlation with the corresponding propane conversion rates, a negative correlation was identified between activity and medium-strong acid site density. This indicates that weak surface acidity (specifically, weak Lewis acid site density of the surface), not medium-strong surface acidity, is crucial to achieving high activity and stability."

The literature does not provide a comprehensive comparison of different Ga2O3 polymorphs in CO2-ODHP reactions. However, it does offer insights into the structural characteristics and surface properties of gallium-alumina mixed oxides that influence catalytic performance in propane dehydrogenation:

1. The study focused on γ-Ga2O3 and its mixed oxides with alumina, rather than comparing different Ga2O3 polymorphs.

2. The coordination state of Ga3+ ions, particularly the presence of tetrahedral Ga3+ sites, plays a crucial role in determining surface acidity and catalytic activity.

3. Increasing aluminum content in the mixed oxides led to a higher proportion of tetrahedral Ga3+ ions.

4. Weak Lewis acid sites, associated with tetrahedral Ga3+ ions, were found to be essential for high catalytic activity and stability in propane dehydrogenation.

5. A positive correlation was observed between weak acid site density and propane conversion rates, while medium-strong acid sites showed a negative correlation with activity.

The study does not provide specific information on the mechanisms of CO2-ODHP reactions or the performance trends during initial and steady-state stages of the reaction for different Ga2O3 polymorphs.

该文献并未对不同Ga2O3多形体在CO2-ODHP反应中的表现进行全面比较。然而，它提供了关于镓-铝混合氧化物的结构特征和表面性质如何影响丙烷脱氢催化性能的见解：

1. 该研究主要集中在γ-Ga2O3及其与氧化铝的混合氧化物上，而非比较不同的Ga2O3多形体。

2. Ga3+离子的配位状态，特别是四面体Ga3+位的存在，在决定表面酸性和催化活性方面起着至关重要的作用。

3. 混合氧化物中铝含量的增加导致四面体Ga3+离子比例的提高。

4. 与四面体Ga3+离子相关的弱Lewis酸位对于丙烷脱氢反应的高催化活性和稳定性至关重要。

5. 弱酸位密度与丙烷转化率之间观察到正相关，而中强酸位与活性之间显示负相关。

该研究未提供关于CO2-ODHP反应机理或不同Ga2O3多形体在反应初始和稳态阶段的性能趋势的具体信息。
