[1] "No diffraction lines assigned to other polymorphs of Ga2O3 were observed for all mixed Ga2O3Al2O3 oxide samples, although several phases of gallium oxide (e.g., α-, β-, and δ-Ga2O3) are known to be present depending on the treatment conditions"

[2] "The 71Ga MAS NMR chemical shift is known to reflect the coordination state of the Ga3+ ion in oxide compounds"

[3] "With increasing aluminum content, a progressively increasing intensity of the line due to the tetrahedral Ga3+ ion (180 ppm) was observed for the GaxAl10xO15 samples, as opposed to the trend for the octahedral Ga3+ ion (10 ppm)."

[4] "The weak acid site density for the galliaalumina mixed oxides is an approximately linear function of the tetrahedral Ga3+ population."

[5] "Whereas the variation of surface weak acid site density demonstrated excellent correlation with the corresponding propane conversion rates, a negative correlation was identified between activity and medium-strong acid site density."

The literature does not provide comprehensive information on how the structural characteristics, surface properties, and Lewis acid sites of different Ga2O3 polymorphs (α-, β-, γ-, and δ-) specifically influence their catalytic performance in CO2-ODHP reactions. The study mainly focuses on γ-Ga2O3 and its mixed oxides with Al2O3.

However, some insights can be drawn from the available information:

1. The study found that the formation of Ga2O3-Al2O3 solid solutions led to an increase in tetrahedral Ga3+ sites, which correlated with an increase in weak Lewis acid sites.

2. The weak Lewis acid sites, particularly those associated with tetrahedral Ga3+ ions, showed a positive correlation with catalytic activity in propane dehydrogenation.

3. Medium-strong acid sites showed a negative correlation with catalytic activity, suggesting that weaker acidity is preferable for this reaction.

4. The study does not directly compare different Ga2O3 polymorphs, but it suggests that the ability to form solid solutions with Al2O3 and create tetrahedral Ga3+ sites is crucial for catalytic performance.

5. No specific mechanisms are proposed to explain activity trends and selectivity during initial and steady-state stages of the reaction for different Ga2O3 polymorphs.

To fully answer the question, more research would be needed to compare the structural characteristics, surface properties, and Lewis acid sites of α-, β-, γ-, and δ-Ga2O3 polymorphs and their specific influences on CO2-ODHP reactions.

该文献并未提供关于不同Ga2O3多晶型（α-、β-、γ-和δ-）的结构特征、表面性质和Lewis酸位如何具体影响其在CO2-ODHP反应中的催化性能的全面信息。该研究主要集中在γ-Ga2O3及其与Al2O3的混合氧化物上。

然而，从可用信息中可以得出一些见解：

1. 研究发现，Ga2O3-Al2O3固溶体的形成导致四面体Ga3+位的增加，这与弱Lewis酸位的增加相关。

2. 弱Lewis酸位，特别是与四面体Ga3+离子相关的酸位，与丙烷脱氢的催化活性呈正相关。

3. 中强酸位与催化活性呈负相关，表明对于这种反应，较弱的酸性更为有利。

4. 该研究并未直接比较不同的Ga2O3多晶型，但它表明能够与Al2O3形成固溶体并创造四面体Ga3+位的能力对催化性能至关重要。

5. 没有提出具体的机制来解释不同Ga2O3多晶型在反应初始和稳态阶段的活性趋势和选择性。

要全面回答这个问题，需要进行更多研究来比较α-、β-、γ-和δ-Ga2O3多晶型的结构特征、表面性质和Lewis酸位，以及它们对CO2-ODHP反应的具体影响。
