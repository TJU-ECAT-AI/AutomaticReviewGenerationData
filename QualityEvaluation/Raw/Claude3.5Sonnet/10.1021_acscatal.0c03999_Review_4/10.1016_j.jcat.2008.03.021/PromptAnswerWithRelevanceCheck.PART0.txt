[1] "No diffraction lines assigned to other polymorphs of Ga2O3 were observed for all mixed Ga2O3Al2O3 oxide samples, although several phases of gallium oxide (e.g., α-, β-, and δ-Ga2O3) are known to be present depending on the treatment conditions [32]."

[2] "Despite the broadness, the diffraction maxima evidenced in the XRD patterns of the galliaalumina samples could be assigned to a single phase having the cubic spinel-type structure (space group Fd3m) [33], as shown by the indexing in Fig. 1."

[3] "The results show that pyridine adsorption on fresh catalysts at room temperature, followed by evacuation at 423 K, gave rise to three characteristic IR bands at 1614 cm1 (ν8a), 1490 cm+1 (ν19a), and ca. 1452 cm1 (ν19b), which can be assigned to pyridine species interacting with Lewis acid sites [34,40,42]."

[4] "Whereas the variation of surface weak acid site density demonstrated excellent correlation with the corresponding propane conversion rates, a negative correlation was identified between activity and medium-strong acid site density."

The literature does not provide a comprehensive comparison of different Ga2O3 polymorphs in CO2-ODHP reactions. However, it does offer some insights into the structural characteristics and surface properties of γ-Ga2O3 and Ga2O3-Al2O3 mixed oxides:

1. The study focused on γ-Ga2O3 and Ga2O3-Al2O3 mixed oxides with a cubic spinel-type structure. Other Ga2O3 polymorphs (α-, β-, and δ-) were not observed in the samples.

2. The catalysts exhibited Lewis acid sites, as evidenced by pyridine adsorption IR spectroscopy. These Lewis acid sites were attributed to coordinatively unsaturated Ga3+ or Al3+ ions in tetrahedral positions.

3. The catalytic activity in propane dehydrogenation correlated positively with the density of weak Lewis acid sites on the catalyst surface. Conversely, a negative correlation was observed between activity and medium-strong acid site density.

4. The formation of Ga2O3-Al2O3 solid solutions resulted in a higher population of tetrahedral Ga3+ sites, which contributed to the increased weak Lewis acidity and improved catalytic performance.

While the study does not directly address the mechanisms of CO2-ODHP reactions, it suggests that the presence of weak Lewis acid sites, particularly those associated with tetrahedral Ga3+ ions, plays a crucial role in the catalytic activity for propane dehydrogenation. The enhanced stability and activity of the Ga2O3-Al2O3 mixed oxides compared to pure γ-Ga2O3 were attributed to the favorable distribution of these active sites and improved thermal stability of the mixed oxide structure.

这篇文献并没有对不同Ga2O3多晶型在CO2-ODHP反应中的表现进行全面比较。但是，它确实提供了一些关于γ-Ga2O3和Ga2O3-Al2O3混合氧化物的结构特征和表面性质的见解：

1. 该研究主要集中在具有立方尖晶石型结构的γ-Ga2O3和Ga2O3-Al2O3混合氧化物上。在样品中没有观察到其他Ga2O3多晶型（α-、β-和δ-）。

2. 通过吡啶吸附红外光谱证实，这些催化剂表现出Lewis酸性位。这些Lewis酸性位被认为是由四面体位置上的配位不饱和Ga3+或Al3+离子引起的。

3. 在丙烷脱氢反应中，催化活性与催化剂表面弱Lewis酸性位的密度呈正相关。相反，活性与中强酸性位密度呈负相关。

4. Ga2O3-Al2O3固溶体的形成导致四面体Ga3+位的数量增加，这促进了弱Lewis酸性的增强和催化性能的改善。

虽然该研究没有直接讨论CO2-ODHP反应的机理，但它表明弱Lewis酸性位的存在，特别是与四面体Ga3+离子相关的酸性位，在丙烷脱氢的催化活性中起着关键作用。与纯γ-Ga2O3相比，Ga2O3-Al2O3混合氧化物表现出更高的稳定性和活性，这归因于这些活性位的有利分布以及混合氧化物结构的改善热稳定性。

[4] "All of the samples exhibited two desorption peaks: a broad peak at 393623 K and a smaller peak at 673800 K, corresponding to acid sites of weak and medium strength, respectively [23]."

The literature does not provide a comprehensive comparison of different Ga2O3 polymorphs in CO2-ODHP reactions. The study focuses mainly on γ-Ga2O3 and Ga2O3-Al2O3 solid solutions. However, some insights can be drawn:

1. Structural characteristics: The study mentions α-, β-, γ-, and δ-Ga2O3 polymorphs, but only γ-Ga2O3 was extensively studied. The γ-Ga2O3-Al2O3 solid solutions maintained a spinel-type structure.

2. Surface properties: The acidity of the catalysts was characterized by NH3-TPD, revealing weak and medium-strength acid sites. The formation of Ga2O3-Al2O3 solid solutions increased the density of weak Lewis acid sites, which was correlated with improved catalytic performance.

3. Lewis acid sites: 71Ga MAS NMR spectroscopy showed that Ga3+ ions occupy both tetrahedral and octahedral sites in the spinel structure. The tetrahedral Ga3+ sites were associated with weak Lewis acidity and were found to be crucial for catalytic activity.

4. Catalytic performance: The γ-Ga2O3-Al2O3 solid solutions, particularly Ga8Al2O15, showed higher activity and stability compared to pure γ-Ga2O3 in propane dehydrogenation reactions. This improved performance was attributed to the higher density of weak Lewis acid sites and better thermal stability of the solid solutions.

5. Mechanisms: The study suggests that low-coordinated Ga3+ cations (Lewis acid sites) play a key role in activating propane through proton abstraction, forming propyl-gallium adspecies. The dehydrogenation products are then formed by the decomposition of these species.

6. Activity trends and selectivity: The initial activity and propylene yield were highest for Ga8Al2O15, while Ga5Al5O15 showed significantly enhanced stability. The weak Lewis acid sites were found to be more important than medium-strong acid sites for achieving high activity and stability.

The study does not provide detailed information on the performance of α-, β-, and δ-Ga2O3 polymorphs in CO2-ODHP reactions, focusing instead on the advantages of γ-Ga2O3-Al2O3 solid solutions over pure γ-Ga2O3.

该文献并未对不同Ga2O3多晶型在CO2-ODHP反应中的表现进行全面比较。研究主要集中在γ-Ga2O3和Ga2O3-Al2O3固溶体上。但可以得出一些见解：

1. 结构特征：研究提到了α-、β-、γ-和δ-Ga2O3多晶型，但主要研究了γ-Ga2O3。γ-Ga2O3-Al2O3固溶体保持了尖晶石型结构。

2. 表面性质：通过NH3-TPD表征了催化剂的酸性，揭示了弱酸和中强酸位。Ga2O3-Al2O3固溶体的形成增加了弱Lewis酸位的密度，这与改善的催化性能相关。

3. Lewis酸位：71Ga MAS NMR光谱显示Ga3+离子在尖晶石结构中同时占据四面体和八面体位置。四面体Ga3+位与弱Lewis酸性相关，被认为对催化活性至关重要。

4. 催化性能：γ-Ga2O3-Al2O3固溶体，特别是Ga8Al2O15，在丙烷脱氢反应中表现出比纯γ-Ga2O3更高的活性和稳定性。这种改善的性能归因于更高密度的弱Lewis酸位和固溶体更好的热稳定性。

5. 机理：研究表明，低配位Ga3+阳离子（Lewis酸位）在通过质子抽取活化丙烷中起关键作用，形成丙基-镓吸附物种。脱氢产物随后通过这些物种的分解而形成。

6. 活性趋势和选择性：Ga8Al2O15的初始活性和丙烯产率最高，而Ga5Al5O15显示出显著增强的稳定性。弱Lewis酸位比中强酸位对实现高活性和稳定性更为重要。

该研究并未提供α-、β-和δ-Ga2O3多晶型在CO2-ODHP反应中性能的详细信息，而是集中讨论了γ-Ga2O3-Al2O3固溶体相对于纯γ-Ga2O3的优势。

The literature does not provide comprehensive information on how the structural characteristics, surface properties, and Lewis acid sites of different Ga2O3 polymorphs (α-, β-, γ-, and δ-) specifically influence their catalytic performance in CO2-ODHP reactions. The study mainly focuses on γ-Ga2O3 and its mixed oxides with Al2O3.

However, some insights can be drawn from the available information:

1. The study found that the formation of Ga2O3-Al2O3 solid solutions led to an increase in tetrahedral Ga3+ sites, which correlated with an increase in weak Lewis acid sites.

2. The weak Lewis acid sites, particularly those associated with tetrahedral Ga3+ ions, showed a positive correlation with catalytic activity in propane dehydrogenation.

3. Medium-strong acid sites showed a negative correlation with catalytic activity, suggesting that weaker acidity is preferable for this reaction.

4. The study does not directly compare different Ga2O3 polymorphs, but it suggests that the ability to form solid solutions with Al2O3 and create tetrahedral Ga3+ sites is crucial for catalytic performance.

5. No specific mechanisms are proposed to explain activity trends and selectivity during initial and steady-state stages of the reaction for different Ga2O3 polymorphs.

To fully answer the question, more research would be needed to compare the structural characteristics, surface properties, and Lewis acid sites of α-, β-, γ-, and δ-Ga2O3 polymorphs and their specific influences on CO2-ODHP reactions.
