[1] "No diffraction lines assigned to other polymorphs of Ga2O3 were observed for all mixed Ga2O3Al2O3 oxide samples, although several phases of gallium oxide (e.g., α-, β-, and δ-Ga2O3) are known to be present depending on the treatment conditions [32]."

[2] "The 71Ga MAS NMR chemical shift is known to reflect the coordination state of the Ga3+ ion in oxide compounds [31,34]."

[3] "According to the literature [31, 3437], these bands are assigned to the central transition of the Ga3+ ion occupying tetrahedral (GaIV) and octahedral (GaVI) sites, respectively."

[4] "All of the samples exhibited two desorption peaks: a broad peak at 393623 K and a smaller peak at 673800 K, corresponding to acid sites of weak and medium strength, respectively [23]."

[5] "This demonstrates that despite its lower Ga2O3 content, a γ -Ga2O3Al2O3 solid solution with suitable composition can be even more active than bulk γ -Ga2O3."

The literature does not provide a comprehensive comparison of different Ga2O3 polymorphs in CO2-ODHP reactions. The study focuses mainly on γ-Ga2O3 and Ga2O3-Al2O3 solid solutions. However, some insights can be drawn:

1. Structural characteristics: The study mentions α-, β-, γ-, and δ-Ga2O3 polymorphs, but only γ-Ga2O3 was extensively studied. The γ-Ga2O3-Al2O3 solid solutions maintained a spinel-type structure.

2. Surface properties: The acidity of the catalysts was characterized by NH3-TPD, revealing weak and medium-strength acid sites. The formation of Ga2O3-Al2O3 solid solutions increased the density of weak Lewis acid sites, which was correlated with improved catalytic performance.

3. Lewis acid sites: 71Ga MAS NMR spectroscopy showed that Ga3+ ions occupy both tetrahedral and octahedral sites in the spinel structure. The tetrahedral Ga3+ sites were associated with weak Lewis acidity and were found to be crucial for catalytic activity.

4. Catalytic performance: The γ-Ga2O3-Al2O3 solid solutions, particularly Ga8Al2O15, showed higher activity and stability compared to pure γ-Ga2O3 in propane dehydrogenation reactions. This improved performance was attributed to the higher density of weak Lewis acid sites and better thermal stability of the solid solutions.

5. Mechanisms: The study suggests that low-coordinated Ga3+ cations (Lewis acid sites) play a key role in activating propane through proton abstraction, forming propyl-gallium adspecies. The dehydrogenation products are then formed by the decomposition of these species.

6. Activity trends and selectivity: The initial activity and propylene yield were highest for Ga8Al2O15, while Ga5Al5O15 showed significantly enhanced stability. The weak Lewis acid sites were found to be more important than medium-strong acid sites for achieving high activity and stability.

The study does not provide detailed information on the performance of α-, β-, and δ-Ga2O3 polymorphs in CO2-ODHP reactions, focusing instead on the advantages of γ-Ga2O3-Al2O3 solid solutions over pure γ-Ga2O3.

该文献并未对不同Ga2O3多晶型在CO2-ODHP反应中的表现进行全面比较。研究主要集中在γ-Ga2O3和Ga2O3-Al2O3固溶体上。但可以得出一些见解：

1. 结构特征：研究提到了α-、β-、γ-和δ-Ga2O3多晶型，但主要研究了γ-Ga2O3。γ-Ga2O3-Al2O3固溶体保持了尖晶石型结构。

2. 表面性质：通过NH3-TPD表征了催化剂的酸性，揭示了弱酸和中强酸位。Ga2O3-Al2O3固溶体的形成增加了弱Lewis酸位的密度，这与改善的催化性能相关。

3. Lewis酸位：71Ga MAS NMR光谱显示Ga3+离子在尖晶石结构中同时占据四面体和八面体位置。四面体Ga3+位与弱Lewis酸性相关，被认为对催化活性至关重要。

4. 催化性能：γ-Ga2O3-Al2O3固溶体，特别是Ga8Al2O15，在丙烷脱氢反应中表现出比纯γ-Ga2O3更高的活性和稳定性。这种改善的性能归因于更高密度的弱Lewis酸位和固溶体更好的热稳定性。

5. 机理：研究表明，低配位Ga3+阳离子（Lewis酸位）在通过质子抽取活化丙烷中起关键作用，形成丙基-镓吸附物种。脱氢产物随后通过这些物种的分解而形成。

6. 活性趋势和选择性：Ga8Al2O15的初始活性和丙烯产率最高，而Ga5Al5O15显示出显著增强的稳定性。弱Lewis酸位比中强酸位对实现高活性和稳定性更为重要。

该研究并未提供α-、β-和δ-Ga2O3多晶型在CO2-ODHP反应中性能的详细信息，而是集中讨论了γ-Ga2O3-Al2O3固溶体相对于纯γ-Ga2O3的优势。
