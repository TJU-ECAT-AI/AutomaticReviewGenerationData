[1] "No diffraction lines assigned to other polymorphs of Ga2O3 were observed for all mixed Ga2O3Al2O3 oxide samples, although several phases of gallium oxide (e.g., α-, β-, and δ-Ga2O3) are known to be present depending on the treatment conditions [32]."

[2] "Despite the broadness, the diffraction maxima evidenced in the XRD patterns of the galliaalumina samples could be assigned to a single phase having the cubic spinel-type structure (space group Fd3m) [33], as shown by the indexing in Fig. 1."

[3] "The results show that pyridine adsorption on fresh catalysts at room temperature, followed by evacuation at 423 K, gave rise to three characteristic IR bands at 1614 cm1 (ν8a), 1490 cm+1 (ν19a), and ca. 1452 cm1 (ν19b), which can be assigned to pyridine species interacting with Lewis acid sites [34,40,42]."

[4] "Whereas the variation of surface weak acid site density demonstrated excellent correlation with the corresponding propane conversion rates, a negative correlation was identified between activity and medium-strong acid site density."

The literature does not provide a comprehensive comparison of different Ga2O3 polymorphs in CO2-ODHP reactions. However, it does offer some insights into the structural characteristics and surface properties of γ-Ga2O3 and Ga2O3-Al2O3 mixed oxides:

1. The study focused on γ-Ga2O3 and Ga2O3-Al2O3 mixed oxides with a cubic spinel-type structure. Other Ga2O3 polymorphs (α-, β-, and δ-) were not observed in the samples.

2. The catalysts exhibited Lewis acid sites, as evidenced by pyridine adsorption IR spectroscopy. These Lewis acid sites were attributed to coordinatively unsaturated Ga3+ or Al3+ ions in tetrahedral positions.

3. The catalytic activity in propane dehydrogenation correlated positively with the density of weak Lewis acid sites on the catalyst surface. Conversely, a negative correlation was observed between activity and medium-strong acid site density.

4. The formation of Ga2O3-Al2O3 solid solutions resulted in a higher population of tetrahedral Ga3+ sites, which contributed to the increased weak Lewis acidity and improved catalytic performance.

While the study does not directly address the mechanisms of CO2-ODHP reactions, it suggests that the presence of weak Lewis acid sites, particularly those associated with tetrahedral Ga3+ ions, plays a crucial role in the catalytic activity for propane dehydrogenation. The enhanced stability and activity of the Ga2O3-Al2O3 mixed oxides compared to pure γ-Ga2O3 were attributed to the favorable distribution of these active sites and improved thermal stability of the mixed oxide structure.

这篇文献并没有对不同Ga2O3多晶型在CO2-ODHP反应中的表现进行全面比较。但是，它确实提供了一些关于γ-Ga2O3和Ga2O3-Al2O3混合氧化物的结构特征和表面性质的见解：

1. 该研究主要集中在具有立方尖晶石型结构的γ-Ga2O3和Ga2O3-Al2O3混合氧化物上。在样品中没有观察到其他Ga2O3多晶型（α-、β-和δ-）。

2. 通过吡啶吸附红外光谱证实，这些催化剂表现出Lewis酸性位。这些Lewis酸性位被认为是由四面体位置上的配位不饱和Ga3+或Al3+离子引起的。

3. 在丙烷脱氢反应中，催化活性与催化剂表面弱Lewis酸性位的密度呈正相关。相反，活性与中强酸性位密度呈负相关。

4. Ga2O3-Al2O3固溶体的形成导致四面体Ga3+位的数量增加，这促进了弱Lewis酸性的增强和催化性能的改善。

虽然该研究没有直接讨论CO2-ODHP反应的机理，但它表明弱Lewis酸性位的存在，特别是与四面体Ga3+离子相关的酸性位，在丙烷脱氢的催化活性中起着关键作用。与纯γ-Ga2O3相比，Ga2O3-Al2O3混合氧化物表现出更高的稳定性和活性，这归因于这些活性位的有利分布以及混合氧化物结构的改善热稳定性。
