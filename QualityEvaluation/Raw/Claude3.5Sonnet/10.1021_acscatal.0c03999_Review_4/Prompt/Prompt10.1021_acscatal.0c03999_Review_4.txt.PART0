3.2. Nonredox-Type Catalysts: Gallium (Ga)
3.2.1. Identification of Active Ga2O3 Polymorphs
To establish the correlation between activity and Ga2O3 polymorphs, Zheng et al. have evaluated the activity performance of α-, β-, γ-, and δ-Ga2O3 polymorphs for CO2ODHP. (121) β- and γ-Ga2O3 outperform the rest in C3H8 conversion and C3H6 selectivity (Table 5). Surface titration experiments reveal that the surface acidity density decreases in the order of β > γ > δ > α, so does the surface basicity. The initial activity is dependent on the surface acid density and maximizes on β-Ga2O3. Both β- and γ-Ga2O3 contain tetrahedral Ga cations in the structure, on which the Lewis acid sites are coordinatively unsaturated Ga3+ sites. α- and δ-Ga2O3 are constituted by octahedral Ga3+, which are more coordinated with weaker acidity; the reconstruction from octahedral to tetrahedral Ga cations might occur, generating surface Lewis acid sites. Such differences in Lewis acidity explain the activity trend. On the other hand, surface basic sites are too few for CO2 adsorption and activation, thereby leading to lower CO2 conversion than C3H8. Nevertheless, the surface base site density shows the correlation with initial activity, demonstrating its promotional effect in the initial period of reaction. Combined with the weak reducibility of Ga2O3 (15 mol % of the fresh Ga2O3) and the presence of Ga+ and Ga3+ in catalysts (XPS), one can postulate that the reduction of Ga cations takes place and benefits DHP but only at the initial stage of the reaction. At the steady state, reaction is proposed to proceed via heterolytic dissociation on Ga oxide without the redox cycle, which is discussed in section 3.2.3.

3.2.2. Mixed Ga-Containing Oxide Catalysts
Ga2O3Al2O3 solid solutions are characteristic of unique surface acid properties and have shown promising reactivity in selective catalytic reduction (SCR) of NOx with hydrocarbons. (122124) Chen et al. have prepared mixed GaxAl10xO15 (i.e., x = 2, 5, and 8) oxides with high surface areas (e.g., 119147 m2 g1). (53) These solid solution catalysts enable the changes of Ga ions between tetrahedral Ga(IV) and octahedral Ga(VI) sites by tuning the Ga/Al ratios. The proportion of Ga(IV) sites correlates to weak acid sites, as shown in Figure 9A, implying the essential role of tetrahedral surface Ga3+ sites in creating the surface acidity. Ga8Al2O15 oxide exhibits the best catalytic performance among all solid solution catalysts, and far outperforms the benchmark γ-Ga2O3 in C3H8 conversion (Table 5). Furthermore, a positive correlation of surface area-based weak acid site density with initial C3H8 conversion is evident in Figure 9B. Combined with the fact that Brnsted acid sites are absent in these catalysts, these tetrahedral surface Ga3+ sites in the form of Al3+OGa3+ are weak Lewis acid sites that account for dehydrogenation reactions. (125) The Ga2O3Al2O3 solid solution catalysts also exhibit better stability than the benchmark γ-Ga2O3, which is attributed to the improved desorption of C3H6 on GaAl catalysts, as evidenced from transient responses of pulsed C3H6 adsorption.
Mixed Ga2O3ZrO2 oxides have also been prepared by a coprecipitation method for CO2ODHP. (126) The as-prepared catalysts present higher surface areas (e.g., 3459 m2 g1) than the bare ZrO2 (e.g., 19 m2 g1). Characterization results confirm the homogeneous mixing of Ga with Zr in the oxides with strong interactions, as well as the monotonic increase in Lewis acid sites with the increase in Ga content in the oxides. These features can be reflected from enhanced C3H8 conversion and C3H6 yield (Table 5). However, the C3H6 selectivity is not comparable to Ga2O3Al2O3 solid solution catalysts under isoconversional conditions (Table 5).
3.2.3. Effects of Support
The nature of the support and its interaction with gallium oxide are crucial to manipulate the reactivity, and can be reflected in the differences in H2 adsorption capacities and acidbase properties. (127) Early efforts have been put forth to modify the acidbase properties of Ga2O3 catalysts by introducing alkali metal oxides such as K. (23) However, the incorporated K covers the acid sites on Ga2O3, exerting a negative impact on both conversion and selectivity (Table 5)
Xu et al. have systematically investigated the support effect by using TiO2, Al2O3, ZrO2, SiO2, and MgO as support materials in DHP and CO2-DOHP, and studied the aspects of acidbase properties, adsorption properties, and metalsupport interactions. (127) TiO2-, ZrO2-, and Al2O3-supported Ga2O3 catalysts display higher activity than MgO- and SiO2-supported counterparts, again corroborating the crucial role of acid sites on Ga2O3 for C3H8 dehydrogenation (Table 5). Ga2O3/MgO shows the lowest activity and selectivity toward C3H6 production due to the strong basicity of MgO, which not only neutralizes the acid sites on Ga2O3 but also favors CO2 adsorption over C3H8. A similar negative impact on activity is also evident for the Li-promoted MgO catalyst. (128)
Since these catalysts show no reduction behavior as evidenced from H2-TPR profiles, the C3H6 formation on Ga2O3 should not proceed through redox mechanisms but rather by following the heterolytic dissociation pathway. Detailed steps in the absence and presence of CO2, as well as the conjugated effect of gallium oxide and the proton on DHP, are illustrated in Figure 10A. (129) For C3H8 heterolytic dissociation (eqs 3-6 and 3-7 in Figure 10) in DHP, eq 3-6 (Figure 10) proceeds slowly and is, therefore, proposed as the RDS. The presence of acid sites can facilitate eqs 3-10 and 3-11 (Figure 10), providing an alternative to promote C3H6 formation by bypassing eq 3-6 (Figure 10). Such a reaction path likely occurs in the cases of TiO2-, ZrO2-, and Al2O3-supported Ga2O3 catalysts with abundant acid sites. For CO2ODHP, dissociative chemisorbed H2 from eqs 3-6 and 3-10 (Figure 10) can be removed through eq 3-8 (i.e., RWGS), as well as eq 3-7(Figure 10). On Ga2O3/TiO2, eq 3-8 is faster than eq 3-7 (Figure 10). More produced H2 is consumed through RWGS, therefore, significantly boosting C3H6 formation by shifting the equilibrium because of the weak adsorption of H2. Eq 3-7 (Figure 10) is fast and still a dominant reaction for the cases of Al2O3-, ZrO2-, and MgO-supported catalysts. Therefore, the CO2-promoting effect on these catalysts is absent (Figure 10B). The promoting effect is not evident on Ga2O3/SiO2 either, resulting from its poor activity in RWGS (Figure 10B). The absence of the CO2-promoting effect is also reported for Ga2O3Al2O3 solid solution catalysts. (53) Another drawback of Ga2O3/TiO2 is that the presence of abundant reduced Gaδ+ on the surface is detrimental to C3H6 selectivity (Table 5), as it is known with high aromatization efficiency. (130)
3.2.4. Explorations to Prepare Ga2O3 with High Surface Area
β-Ga2O3 is the most active among all Ga2O3 polymorphs, yet its surface area (e.g., 30 m2 g1) limits its overall activity. For the DHP reaction, various methods have been developed to tune the textural properties of Ga2O3, such as the nanocasting technique using mesoporous carbon as a hard template (131) and the urea-based hydrothermal method using polyethylene glycol as a soft template agent. (132) The former method enables a significant increase in surface area up to 307 m2 g1, but it is tedious and time-consuming; the latter one exerts limited accessible area (29 m2 g1).
Wu et al. have demonstrated a method to synthesize mesoporous Ga2O3 with high surface area using a water-soluble, ecofriendly sucrose as a nonsurfactant template. (133) By increasing the sucrose/Ga2O3 molar ratio, the surface area of as-prepared β-Ga2O3 can be varied in the range of 6598 m2 g1. Among the catalysts, β-Ga2O3S4 (sucrose/Ga2O3 molar ratio = 4) exhibits the highest catalytic performance, and outperforms the thermal decomposition-prepared β-Ga2O3 (Table 5). Furthermore, nearly 90% initial activity can be recovered after regeneration, which surpasses the value (74%) reported by Zheng et al. (121)
To prepare Ga2O3 with high surface area and mesophase, other soft templating approaches have been undertaken. (134,135) However, these are rather challenging because the yielded surfactantGa2O3 mesophase often collapses during thermal treatment, resulting in poorly ordered mesoporous Ga2O3 with low surface area. A nanocasting technique using a hard template, on the other hand, provides avenues to improve the heat tolerance, which uses a well-ordered, mesoporous structured matrix as a hard template, such as siliceous (e.g., SBA-15, KIT-6) or carbonaceous (e.g., CMK-3) materials. Michorczyk et al. have used SBA-15 as a hard template to prepare mesoporous Ga2O3-m and mixed Ga2O3Al2O3 oxides (Ga/Al = 4/1 and 1/4) by the nanocasting method. (136) The as-prepared catalysts feature (i) high surface area, ranging from 231 to 322 m2 g1, wherein the mixed oxide catalysts even show higher surface area than Ga2O3-m, (ii) uniform mesopores in the range of 314 nm, and (iii) characteristic pore architectures analogous to SBA-15 (hexagonal structure). As listed in Table 5, Ga2O3-m and Ga2O3Al2O3(4/1) show comparable initial C3H8 conversion and C3H6 selectivity as the benchmark Ga2O3-t, which is produced by thermal decomposition of precursors. Notably, the nanocasting technique-prepared catalysts exert better stability, and all surpass the benchmark Ga2O3-t at TOS = 3.75 h, particularly for Ga2O3Al2O3(1/4). A short regeneration in air can help Ga2O3-m almost completely recover its activity.
Alternatively, Xiao et al. have prepared Ga2O3Al2O3 (GA) catalysts with high surface area (i.e., 234 and 220 m2 g1, respectively) by hydrothermal synthesis (HS) and coprecipitation method (CP). (137) GA-HS exhibits the highest C3H8 conversion and C3H6 selectivity (Table 5). In addition to high surface area, the HS-prepared catalyst also features large pore sizes and more tetrahedral Ga ions as Lewis acid sites, all of which give rise to the improved catalytic performance.
