 revealed
 that  the  chromium
 species
 anchored
 on  the surface
 of
mesoporous
 supports
 show  structural
 properties
 similar  to  those
 on  the
 conventional
 silicas,
 but  a  higher
dispersion
 of  chromium
 species
 could
 be achieved
 using  mesoporous
 supports
 due
 to
 their
 much  higher
SBET.  This  reflects  in  higher  content
 of
 Cr6+ species
 stabilized
 in  comparison
 with
 conventional
 silicas.
The
 Cr6+ species
 was  found
 to be  crucial
 for  high
 activity  in  the  dehydrogenation
 of  propane
 with  CO2
(DHPCO2).  The
 rate  of  propene
 formation
 increases
 almost
 proportionally
 to the  concentration
 of  Cr6+
species
 in  the  calcined
 catalysts.
 In  situ
 UVvis
 DRS  measurements
 during
 DHPCO2 process  evidences
that
 the  Cr6+ species
 are  reduced
 rapidly  (in  a stream
 of  CO2 +  propane)
 to Cr3+ and  Cr2+ species
 indicating
that
 the  Cr6+ species
 are  rather
 precursor
 than  active  sites,  similar
 as  in  nonoxidative
 dehydrogenation
of
 propane
 (DHP).
 The
 reduction
 of
 Cr6+ species
 generates
 dispersed
 Cr3+ and
 Cr2+ sites  at the beginning
of
 the  DHPCO2 that  participate
 in  nonoxidative
 pathway
 of  propene
 formation.
 In  the  presence
 of  CO2,
Cr3+ and  Cr2+ sites,  may  participate
 additionally
 in  an  alternative
 oxidative
 pathway
 of  propene  formation
and
 in  a consumption

 Introduction
Dehydrogenation
 of
 light
 alkanes
 in
 the
 presence
 of
 CO2 is
 con-
sidered
 to
 be
 one
 of
 the
 alternative
 methods
 of
 obtaining
 valuable
alkenes
 with
 a
 higher
 yield
 than
 in
 the
 non-oxidative
 dehydrogena-
tion
 variation,
 as
 well
 as
 a
 method
 of
 chemical
 CO2 utilization.
 Many
recent
 investigations
 have
 focused
 on
 dehydrogenation
 of
 propane
to
 propene
 in
 the
 presence
 of
 CO2.
 These
 investigations
 have
 been
encouraged
 by
 a
 strong
 demand
 for
 propene,
 which
 has
 become
one
 of
 the
 most
 important
 petrochemicals
 used
 for
 the
 produc-
tion
 of
 a
 variety
 of
 polymers
 and
 chemical
 intermediates,
 such
 as:
polypropylene,
 acrylonitile,
 OXO
 alcohols,
 isopropyl
 alcohol,
 acrylic
acid
 and
 propylene
 oxide.
So
 far,
 different
 bulk
 and
 supported
 oxide-based
 materials
 con-
taining
 active
 species,
 such
 as:
 Cr
 [114],
 Ga
 [6,1420],
 Zn
 [21],
 Fe
[22],
 V
 [10,23,24],
 In
 [25,26]
 and
 Mn  [27,28]
 have
 been
 investigated
as
 catalysts
 for
 dehydrogenation
 of
 propane
 in
 the
 presence
 of
 CO2.

The
 results
 of
 these
 investigations
 lead
 to
 the
 following
 general
conclusions:
(i)
 In
 the
 presence
 of
 CO2,
 propene
 is
 obtained
 simultaneously
with
 dehydrogenation
 and
 oxidative
 dehydrogenation
 path-
ways.
 The
 promoting
 effect
 of
 CO2 is
 explained
 either
 by
 its
participation
 in
 direct
 oxidation
 of
 propane
 to
 propene
 (1)
 or
the
 consumption
 of
 hydrogen
 in
 the
 reverse
 water-gas
 shift
reaction
 
 RWGS
 (2),
 which
 shifts
 the
 equilibrium
 of
 propane
dehydrogenation
 (3).

The
 first,
 direct
 oxidative
 pathway
 with
 CO2 was
 proposed
in
 the
 case
 of
 redox
 oxides
 (Cr,
 V
 and
 Fe),
 whereas
 in
 the
 case
of
 nonredox
 materials,
 such
 as
 gallium
 oxide-based
 catalysts,
CO2 participates
 mainly
 in
 the
 removal
 of
 H2 in
 the
 reverse
water-gas
 shift
 reaction.
(ii)
 The
 oxide
 catalysts
 which
 are
 active
 in
 the
 non-oxidative
 dehy-
drogenation
 of
 propane
 are
 also
 active
 in
 the
 process
 with
 CO2.

Among
 the
 investigated
 materials,
 those
 containing
 Cr
 or
 Ga
were
 found
 to
 be
 the
 most
 active
 and
 selective.
(iii)
 Depending
 on
 the
 nature
 of
 the
 support,
 CO2 has
 a
 promot-
ing
 or
 poisoning
 effect
 on
 its
 catalytic
 properties.
 This
 can
be
 seen
 most
 clearly
 in
 the
 case
 of
 supported
 chromium
 and
gallium
 oxide
 materials.
 CO2 has
 a
 negative
 effect
 on
 the
Cr2O3/Al2O3 catalyst,
 while
 a
 promoting
 effect
 is
 observed
 over
the
 Cr2O3/SiO2 catalyst
 [8,9,13].
 In
 the
 case
 of
 gallium
 oxide
materials,
 CO2 enhances
 the
 dehydrogenation
 activity
 of
 the
Ga2O3/TiO2 catalyst
 but
 suppresses
 that
 of
 the
 Ga2O3/Al2O3
and
 Ga2O3/ZrO2 catalysts
 [17].
The
 catalytic
 activity
 of
 silica-supported
 chromium
 oxide
 mate-
rials
 (Cr/silica)
 depends
 on
 several
 factors
 including
 oxidation
states,
 the
 structure
 of
 the
 Cr
 species
 and
 chromiumsilica
 interac-
tion.
 These
 factors
 are
 influenced
 by
 the
 type
 of
 the
 Cr
 precursor,
preparation
 conditions
 (e.g.,
 calcination
 temperature),
 Cr
 content
and
 the
 properties
 of
 the
 silica
 support
 (e.g.
 iso-electric
 point
 
IEP)
 [2931].  Cr
 species
 on
 3+,
 5+
 and
 6+
 oxidation
 states
 coexist
on
 the
 surface
 of
 oxidized
 Cr/silica
 catalysts.
 Below
 the
 monolayer
coverage
 of
 silica,
 Cr
 species
 in
 the
 higher
 oxidation
 states,
 mainly
as
 Cr6+ species
 in
 the
 form
 of
 mono-
 and
 polychromates,
 dominate.
These
 highly
 dispersed
 and
 fully
 accessible
 for
 reactants
 species
 are
believed
 to
 be
 the
 active
 sites
 or
 the
 precursors
 of
 the
 active
 sites
[2,4,3235].
 When
 the
 Cr
 content
 exceeds
 the
 monolayer
 coverage,
amorphous
 and
 crystalline
 -Cr2O3 are
 formed
 [35].
 The
 forma-
tion
 of
 crystalline
 -Cr2O3,
 which
 is
 the
 most
 thermodynamically
stable
 chromium
 oxide
 phase,
 is
 accelerated
 by
 high
 temperature
and
 by
 the
 excess
 of
 water
 [30].
 The
 presence
 of
 -Cr2O3 on
 the
surface
 of
 silica
 has
 a
 negative
 influence
 on
 the
 catalytic
 activity
as
 not
 all
 of
 the
 Cr
 atoms
 are
 accessible
 to
 the
 reactant
 molecules.
Moreover,
 crystalline
 -Cr2O3 is
 highly
 resistant
 to
 hydrogen
 and
oxygen
 what
 makes
 it
 useless
 as
 a
 catalyst
 [30].
The
 above
 general
 description
 concerning
 Cr/SiO2 systems
 indi-
cates
 that
 for
 obtaining
 a
 high
 activity,
 a
 high
 dispersion
 of
 Cr
species
 has
 to
 be
 achieved.
 Therefore,
 more
 attention
 has
 been
recently
 paid
 to
 using
 high
 surface
 area
 mesoporous
 materials
 as
the
 supports
 for
 dispersing
 of
 chromium
 species.
 These
 materi-
als
 possess
 a
 24
 times
 larger
 surface
 area
 than
 the
 commercial
silica
 gels
 and
 have
 a
 uniform
 pore
 structure.
 So
 far,
 different
Cr-containing
 mesoporous
 sieves
 (MCM-41,
 SBA-1,
 SBA-15
 and
MSU-x)
 prepared
 with
 various
 techniques
 have
 been
 investigated
in
 dehydrogenation
 of
 propane
 with
 CO2 [1,35,7,11,12].
In
 this
 work
 we
 presented
 a
 comparative
 study
 of
 the
 catalytic
performance
 of
 chromium
 oxide
 supported
 on
 different
 siliceous
supports
 including
 mesoporous
 sieves
 with
 cubic
 (SBA-1)
 and
hexagonal
 (SBA-15)
 pore
 structure
 and
 two
 commercially
 available
silica.
 Using
 various
 physicochemical
 characterization
 techniques
we
 investigated
 the
 influence
 of
 Cr
 loading
 and
 supports
 proper-
ties
 on
 the
 surface
 composition
 and
 Cr
 dispersion.
 Finally
 based
 on
the
 characterization
 results
 of
 catalysts
 we
 discussed
 the
 catalytic
performance
 in
 the
 DHPCO2 process.

 Experimental
2.1.
 Preparation
 of
 mesoporous
 supports
 and
 catalysts
Cetyltriethylammonium
 bromide
 (CTEABr)
 was
 synthesized
 by
reaction
 of
 1-bromohexadecane
 (97%,
 Aldrich)
 with
 an
 equimolar
amount
 of
 triethylamine
 (98%,
 Fluka)
 in
 ethanol
 (99.8%,
 Chempur)
under
 reflux
 for
 72
 h.
 The
 surfactant
 cetyltriethylammonium
bromide
 (CTEABr)
 was
 purified
 by
 recrystallization
 from
 chloro-
form/ethyl
 acetate
 mixture
 [36].
SBA-1
 was
 prepared
 under
 acidic
 conditions
 using
 CTEABr
 as
the
 surfactant
 and
 tetraethyl
 orthosilicate
 (TEOS)
 as
 the
 silica
source
 according
 to
 a
 literature
 procedure
 [37].
 In
 a
 typical
 syn-
thesis,
 10
 g
 of
 CTEABr,
 1157
 cm3 of
 distilled
 water
 and
 566
 cm3 of
hydrochloric
 acid
 (37%,
 Chempur)
 were
 combined
 to
 form
 a
 homo-
geneous
 solution,
 which
 was
 cooled
 to
 0 C
 and
 stirred
 (400
 rpm)
for
 30
 min.
 Then
 27.90
 cm3 of
 TEOS
 (98%,
 Aldrich)
 precooled
 to
 0 C
was
 added,
 while
 vigorous
 stirring.
 The
 molar
 composition
 of
 the
reaction
 mixture
 was
 TEOS:CTEABr:HCl:H2O
 =
 1:0.2:56:700.
 Stir-
ring
 was
 continued
 for
 4
 h
 until
 precipitation
 of
 the
 silica-surfactant
assemblies
 was
 complete.
 Next,
 the
 material
 formed
 at
 0 C
 was
aged
 in
 the
 reaction
 mixture
 by
 heating
 at
 100 C
 for
 1
 h,
 to
 improve
cross-linking
 of
 the
 silica
 framework.
 The
 resultant
 precipitate
 was
filtered
 off
 and
 dried
 (without
 washing)
 at
 60 C
 overnight.
 This
material
 was
 washed
 with
 ethanolwaterHCl
 mixture,
 dried
 and
then
 calcined
 in
 air
 by
 rising
 temperature
 from
 ambient
 to
 550 C
over
 9
 h
 period
 and
 then
 keeping
 it
 at
 550 C
 for
 another
 12
 h.
SBA-15
 was
 synthesized
 under
 acidic
 conditions
 using
 Pluronic
P123
 triblock
 copolymer
 (EO20PO70EO20,
 Mav =
 5800,
 from
 Aldrich)
and
 tetraethyl
 orthosilicate
 (TEOS)
 as
 the
 silica
 source.
 In
 a
polypropylene
 bottle,
 8
 g
 of
 Pluronic
 P123
 was
 dissolved
 in
 a
 solu-
tion
 containing
 60
 g
 of
 distilled
 water
 and
 120
 g
 of
 2
 M
 HCl
 at
 35 C.
The
 mixture
 was
 vigorously
 stirred
 until
 complete
 dissolution
 of
Pluronic
 P123.
 Next,
 17
 g
 of
 TEOS
 (98%,
 Aldrich)
 was
 added
 drop-
wise
 to
 the
 clear
 solution,
 while
 continues
 stirring
 (400
 rpm)
 at
35 C.
 Finally,
 the
 mixture
 was
 stirred
 (400
 rpm)
 for
 another
 20
 h
at
 35 C
 and
 then
 hydrothermally
 treated
 under
 static
 conditions
for
 24
 h
 at
 90 C.
 The
 resultant
 white
 precipitate
 was
 filtered
 off
without
 washing,
 dried
 overnight
 at
 60 C
 and
 calcined
 as
 SBA-1
material.
Catalysts
 with
 0.7,
 2.1,
 3.4
 and
 6.8
 wt.%
 of
 Cr
 were
 prepared
 by
the
 incipient
 wetness
 method
 using
 Cr(NO3)3·9H2O
 (Polish
 Chemi-
cal
 Reagents,
 POCh)
 as
 a
 chromium
 source.
 Before
 the
 impregnation
all
 of
 the
 silica
 supports
 were
 dried
 for
 12
 h
 at
 120 C.
 Typically,
1
 g
 of
 a
 mesoporous
 support
 (SBA-1
 or
 SBA-15)
 was
 treated
 with
4.0
 cm3 of
 an
 aqueous
 solution
 containing
 the
 desired
 amount
of
 Cr(NO3)3,
 while
 1
 g
 of
 a
 commercial
 silica
 material
 (SiO2-p
from
 POCh
 or
 SiO2-a
 from
 Aldrich)
 was
 treated
 with
 0.8
 cm3 of
the
 precursor
 solution.
 The
 impregnated
 samples
 were
 dried
 at
room
 temperature
 overnight,
 then
 for
 6
 h
 at
 60 C
 and
 finally
 cal-
cined
 at
 550 C
 for
 6
 h
 in
 air.
 According
 the
 above
 procedure,
 four
series
 of
 catalysts
 were
 obtained
 and
 were
 designated
 as
 Crx/SBA-
1,
 Crx/SBA-15,
 Crx/SiO2-a
 and
 Crx/SiO2-p,
 respectively,
 where
 x
expresses
 the
 establish
 Cr
 content
 in
 wt.%
 of
 Cr.
2.2.
 Characterization
Total
 Cr
 content
 (Crtot)
 in
 the
 catalysts
 was
 determined
 by
 ICP
spectrometry
 (Perkin
 Elmer
 ELAN
 6100).
 The
 catalysts
 samples
were
 dissolved
 in
 a
 mixture
 of
 HF
 and
 HNO3.
The
 amount
 of
 Cr6+ species
 in
 the
 fresh
 catalysts
 was
 determined
by
 chemical
 analysis
 (BunsenRupp
 method)
 [38].
 The
 method
relies
 on
 treating
 a
 sample
 of
 fresh
 catalyst
 with
 concentrated
 HCl
which
 leads
 to
 reduction
 of
 Cr6+ ions
 to
 Cr3+,
 according
 to
 the
 formal
reaction:
 Cr2O72+
 6Cl+
 14H+ =
 3Cl2 +
 2Cr3+ +
 7H2O.
 The
 evolved
Cl2 is
 quantitatively
 determined
 by
 iodometric
 titration.
 It
 should
be
 noted
 that
 in
 this
 method,
 Cr5+ species
 (if
 present
 in
 the
 sample)
are
 determined
 together
 with
 Cr6+ species.
 However,
 the
 amount
of
 the
 former
 species
 in
 the
 supported
 catalysts
 was
 assumed
 to
 be
small,
 typically
 below
 a
 few
 percent
 of
 the
 total
 Cr
 content
 [39,40].
The
 apparatus
 for
 performing
 the
 analysis
 was
 described
 by
 Dere 
n
et
 al.
 [41].
 In
 a
 typical
 procedure,
 200
 mg  of
 fresh
 catalysts
 was
placed
 into
 a
 vessel
 and
 after
 purification
 in
 argon
 flow,
 20
 cm3 of
HCl
 (36
 wt.%,
 POCh)
 was
 added.
 In
 order
 to
 accelerate
 evolving
 of
Cl2,
 the
 mixture
 was
 heated
 up
 to
 80 C
 for
 0.5
 h.
 During
 the
 heating,
the
 mixture
 of
 gases
 (Ar,
 Cl2,
 H2O
 and
 HCl)
 was
 passed
 through
 a
second
 vessel
 filled
 with
 0.1
 M
 solution
 of
 KI
 (100
 cm3).

 were
 measured
 at
196 C
 using
 a
 Quantachrome

 instrument.
 The

ples
 were
 degassed
 at

 before

 was
 calculated
 using
 the
 BrunauerEmmettTeller
 (BET)
method
 within
 the

 range
 P/P0 =

 Pore

 distribution
 was
 determined
 from
 the
 branch
 of
 the
 adsorption
curve,
 using
 the
 BarrettJoynerHalenda
 (BJH)
 model.
 Pore

was
 obtained
 from
 the
 volumes
 of
 nitrogen
 adsorbed
 at
 P/P0 =

or

<questions>


How do the structural characteristics, surface properties (particularly acidity and basicity), and Lewis acid sites of different Ga2O3 polymorphs (α-, β-, γ-, and δ-) influence their catalytic performance in CO2-ODHP reactions, and what mechanisms are proposed to explain the observed activity trends and selectivity during both initial and steady-state stages of the reaction?

First, you need to sequentially extract any quotes in the literature that are most relevant to each question, and print them in numbered order, separated by newlines. Quotes should be relatively brief. Do not attempt to summarize or answer questions at this stage, but simply repeat exactly what the corresponding part of the literature says.

Please enclose the full list of quotes in <quotes></quotes> XML tags. If there are no relevant quotes, write "No relevant quotes" instead.

Then, answer the question, starting with "Answer:".  Do not include or reference quoted content verbatim in the answer. Don't say "According to Quote [1]" when answering. Do not write reference number of quotes after answer. Put your answer to the user inside <EnglishVersionAnswer></EnglishVersionAnswer> XML tags. Output formatted text, with line breaks for each question.Separate quotes and answers with a blank line. Provide the answers to all questions in English. After completing the English answers, translate all those answers into Chinese and provide the Chinese version inside <ChineseVersionAnswer></ChineseVersionAnswer> XML tags.

Thus, the format of your overall response should look like what's shown between the <example></example> tags.  Make sure to follow the formatting and spacing exactly.
