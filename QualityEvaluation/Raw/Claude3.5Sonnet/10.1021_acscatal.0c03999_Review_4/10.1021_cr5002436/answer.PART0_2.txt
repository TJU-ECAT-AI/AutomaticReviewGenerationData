[1] "β-Ga2O3 has a monoclinic structure, in which gallium atoms are equally distributed between tetrahedral and octahedral configurations. This crystal structure has a high concentration of weak Lewis acid sites (coordinatively unsaturated tetrahedral ones on the surface of the material), which are deemed to be centers of dehydrogenation activity."

[2] "Chen et al., (232) who, by relating the results of NH3-TPD measurements with activity data for different GaxAl10xO15 mixed oxides, showed that a high concentration of Lewis acid groups in the form of coordinatively unsaturated tetrahedral Ga3+ cations is a prerequisite for dehydrogenation activity"

[3] "Several authors have performed DFT calculations in an effort to understand the dehydrogenation reaction mechanism on Ga2O3. Studies by Liu et al. regarding propane dehydrogenation on a perfect Ga2O3 (100) surface revealed that the CH bond is activated by a surface oxygen that abstracts an hydrogen from the propane molecule, thus forming a propyl species, which coordinates with a Ga surface site and a hydroxyl group."

[4] "Nakagawa et al. found that the addition of steam and CO2 decreased coke deposition on a Ga2O3/TiO2 catalyst by the Boudouart reaction, while also assisting ethylene desorption."

The literature does not provide comprehensive information on how different Ga2O3 polymorphs influence CO2-ODHP reactions specifically. However, some insights can be drawn from the available information on Ga2O3 catalysts in dehydrogenation reactions:

1. Structure and Lewis acidity: β-Ga2O3, with its monoclinic structure, contains a high concentration of weak Lewis acid sites in the form of coordinatively unsaturated tetrahedral Ga3+ cations on the surface. These sites are considered to be the centers of dehydrogenation activity.

2. Activity correlation: A high concentration of Lewis acid groups, specifically coordinatively unsaturated tetrahedral Ga3+ cations, is crucial for dehydrogenation activity. This suggests that polymorphs with more of these sites would likely perform better in CO2-ODHP reactions.

3. Reaction mechanism: On a Ga2O3 (100) surface, the C-H bond activation occurs when a surface oxygen abstracts a hydrogen from the propane molecule, forming a propyl species that coordinates with a Ga surface site and a hydroxyl group. This mechanism might be applicable to CO2-ODHP reactions as well, with variations depending on the specific polymorph structure.

4. CO2 effect: The addition of CO2 to Ga2O3 catalysts has been observed to decrease coke deposition and assist in product desorption. This suggests that CO2 plays a beneficial role in the reaction beyond being just an oxidant, potentially interacting differently with various Ga2O3 polymorphs.

While the literature doesn't explicitly compare different Ga2O3 polymorphs in CO2-ODHP reactions, it suggests that the polymorph with the highest concentration of coordinatively unsaturated tetrahedral Ga3+ sites would likely show the best catalytic performance. Further research specifically comparing α-, β-, γ-, and δ-Ga2O3 in CO2-ODHP reactions would be needed to fully answer the question.

文献中没有提供关于不同Ga2O3多晶型如何影响CO2-ODHP反应的全面信息。但是，从可获得的Ga2O3催化剂在脱氢反应中的信息可以得出一些见解：

1. 结构和路易斯酸性：β-Ga2O3具有单斜结构，表面含有高浓度的弱路易斯酸位，以配位不饱和的四面体Ga3+阳离子形式存在。这些位点被认为是脱氢活性的中心。

2. 活性相关性：高浓度的路易斯酸基团，特别是配位不饱和的四面体Ga3+阳离子，对脱氢活性至关重要。这表明具有更多这些位点的多晶型可能在CO2-ODHP反应中表现更好。

3. 反应机理：在Ga2O3 (100)表面上，C-H键的活化发生在表面氧从丙烷分子中提取氢原子时，形成与Ga表面位点和羟基配位的丙基物种。这种机理可能也适用于CO2-ODHP反应，但会因特定的多晶型结构而有所变化。

4. CO2的影响：向Ga2O3催化剂中添加CO2被观察到可以减少积碳沉积并协助产物脱附。这表明CO2在反应中除了作为氧化剂外还起到有益作用，可能与不同的Ga2O3多晶型有不同的相互作用。

虽然文献没有明确比较不同Ga2O3多晶型在CO2-ODHP反应中的表现，但它表明具有最高浓度配位不饱和四面体Ga3+位点的多晶型可能会表现出最好的催化性能。需要进一步专门比较α-、β-、γ-和δ-Ga2O3在CO2-ODHP反应中的研究才能完全回答这个问题。
