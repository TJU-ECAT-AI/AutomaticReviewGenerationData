The structural characteristics and surface properties of different Ga2O3 polymorphs significantly influence their catalytic performance in CO2-ODHP reactions. Among the polymorphs, β-Ga2O3 is reported to be the most stable and active in propane dehydrogenation. Its monoclinic structure features an equal distribution of gallium atoms between tetrahedral and octahedral configurations, resulting in a high concentration of weak Lewis acid sites on the surface.

These Lewis acid sites, specifically coordinatively unsaturated tetrahedral Ga3+ cations, are crucial for dehydrogenation activity. The concentration of these sites is directly correlated with catalytic performance, as evidenced by studies showing that catalysts with higher concentrations of these sites exhibit better dehydrogenation activity.

The acidity of the catalyst surface plays a vital role in the reaction mechanism. Acidic groups are believed to catalyze the dehydrogenation reaction, as demonstrated by experiments where the addition of basic promoters like potassium decreased catalytic activity.

The presence of CO2 in the reactant feed improves olefin yield through multiple mechanisms. CO2 acts as a mild oxidant, helping to remove hydrogen from the reaction mixture through the reverse water-gas shift reaction. This shifts the equilibrium towards olefin formation. Additionally, CO2 assists in decreasing coke deposition on the catalyst surface through the Boudouart reaction, which helps maintain catalyst activity over time.

The reaction mechanism likely involves the adsorption of the alkane on the Lewis acid sites, followed by C-H bond activation. The presence of CO2 not only helps shift the equilibrium but also assists in product desorption, particularly for ethylene, which enhances overall catalytic performance.

During the initial stages of the reaction, the catalyst may undergo some changes as it adapts to the reaction conditions. The steady-state performance is likely achieved once the balance between coke formation and removal (assisted by CO2) is established, and the surface Lewis acid sites reach a stable configuration.

While the literature provides insights into the general mechanisms and trends, more detailed studies comparing the different Ga2O3 polymorphs (α-, γ-, and δ-) in CO2-ODHP reactions would be needed to fully elucidate their specific influences on catalytic performance and selectivity throughout the reaction stages.

不同Ga2O3多形体的结构特征和表面性质显著影响其在CO2-ODHP反应中的催化性能。在这些多形体中，β-Ga2O3被报道为最稳定和最活跃的丙烷脱氢催化剂。其单斜结构特征是镓原子在四面体和八面体构型之间均匀分布，导致表面上存在高浓度的弱Lewis酸位点。

这些Lewis酸位点，特别是配位不饱和的四面体Ga3+阳离子，对脱氢活性至关重要。这些位点的浓度与催化性能直接相关，研究表明具有更高浓度这些位点的催化剂表现出更好的脱氢活性。

催化剂表面的酸性在反应机理中起着至关重要的作用。酸性基团被认为能催化脱氢反应，这一点通过添加碱性助剂（如钾）会降低催化活性的实验得到证实。

反应物料中CO2的存在通过多种机制改善烯烃产率。CO2作为温和的氧化剂，通过逆水气变换反应帮助从反应混合物中去除氢气。这使平衡向烯烃形成方向移动。此外，CO2通过Boudouart反应协助减少催化剂表面的积碳沉积，有助于长期保持催化剂活性。

反应机理可能涉及烷烃在Lewis酸位点上的吸附，随后发生C-H键活化。CO2的存在不仅有助于移动平衡，还协助产物脱附，特别是乙烯，从而提高整体催化性能。

在反应的初始阶段，催化剂可能会随着适应反应条件而发生一些变化。一旦建立了积碳形成和去除（在CO2的辅助下）之间的平衡，且表面Lewis酸位点达到稳定构型，就可能达到稳态性能。

虽然文献提供了关于一般机制和趋势的见解，但需要更详细的研究来比较不同Ga2O3多形体（α-、γ-和δ-）在CO2-ODHP反应中的具体影响，以全面阐明它们在整个反应阶段对催化性能和选择性的影响。
