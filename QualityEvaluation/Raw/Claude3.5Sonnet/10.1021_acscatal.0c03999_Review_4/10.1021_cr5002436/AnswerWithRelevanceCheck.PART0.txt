          "β-Ga2O3 has a monoclinic structure, in which gallium atoms are equally distributed between tetrahedral and octahedral configurations. This crystal structure has a high concentration of weak Lewis acid sites (coordinatively unsaturated tetrahedral ones on the surface of the material), which are deemed to be centers of dehydrogenation activity."

"Chen et al. reported that a high concentration of Lewis acid groups in the form of coordinatively unsaturated tetrahedral Ga3+ cations is a prerequisite for dehydrogenation activity"

"Michorczyk et al. concluded that acidic groups catalyze the reaction after observing that promotion with a base, such as potassium, resulted in a decrease in activity."

"The addition of CO2 to the reactant feed improves the olefin yield."

"Nakagawa et al. found that the addition of steam and CO2 decreased coke deposition on a Ga2O3/TiO2 catalyst by the Boudouart reaction, while also assisting ethylene desorption."

"CO2 competitively adsorbs on the surface, specifically on the basic sites of the catalyst materials, which can negatively affect their performance."

"Several authors have performed DFT calculations in an effort to understand the dehydrogenation reaction mechanism on Ga2O3. Studies by Liu et al. regarding propane dehydrogenation on a perfect Ga2O3 (100) surface revealed that the CH bond is activated by a surface oxygen that abstracts an hydrogen from the propane molecule, thus forming a propyl species, which coordinates with a Ga surface site and a hydroxyl group."

          The structural characteristics and surface properties of Ga2O3 polymorphs significantly influence their catalytic performance in CO2-ODHP reactions:

1. Structure: β-Ga2O3, with its monoclinic structure, has gallium atoms equally distributed between tetrahedral and octahedral configurations. This structure results in a high concentration of weak Lewis acid sites on the surface.

2. Lewis acid sites: Coordinatively unsaturated tetrahedral Ga3+ cations act as weak Lewis acid sites and are crucial for dehydrogenation activity. Higher concentrations of these sites correlate with improved catalytic performance.

3. Surface acidity: Acidic groups on the catalyst surface play a significant role in the reaction mechanism. The addition of basic promoters like potassium decreases catalytic activity, suggesting the importance of surface acidity.

4. CO2 influence: 
   a) CO2 improves olefin yield by acting as a mild oxidant and shifting equilibrium towards product formation.
   b) It assists in decreasing coke deposition through the Boudouart reaction.
   c) CO2 helps with product desorption, particularly ethylene.
   d) However, CO2 can also competitively adsorb on basic sites, potentially negatively affecting performance.

5. Reaction mechanism: On a Ga2O3 (100) surface, C-H bond activation occurs when a surface oxygen abstracts a hydrogen from the propane molecule, forming a propyl species that coordinates with a Ga surface site and a hydroxyl group.

While the literature provides insights into β-Ga2O3, it lacks comprehensive comparisons between different Ga2O3 polymorphs (α-, β-, γ-, and δ-) in CO2-ODHP reactions. More research is needed to fully understand the behavior of various Ga2O3 polymorphs and their performance over time, including initial and steady-state stages of the reaction.

          Ga2O3多形体的结构特征和表面性质显著影响其在CO2-ODHP反应中的催化性能：

1. 结构：β-Ga2O3具有单斜结构，镓原子均匀分布在四面体和八面体构型中。这种结构导致表面上存在高浓度的弱Lewis酸位点。

2. Lewis酸位点：配位不饱和的四面体Ga3+阳离子作为弱Lewis酸位点，对脱氢活性至关重要。这些位点的浓度越高，催化性能越好。

3. 表面酸度：催化剂表面的酸性基团在反应机理中起重要作用。添加碱性助剂（如钾）会降低催化活性，表明表面酸度的重要性。

4. CO2的影响：
   a) CO2作为温和的氧化剂改善烯烃产率，将平衡向产物形成方向移动。
   b) 通过Boudouart反应帮助减少积碳沉积。
   c) CO2有助于产物脱附，特别是乙烯。
   d) 然而，CO2也可能在碱性位点上竞争性吸附，潜在地对性能产生负面影响。

5. 反应机理：在Ga2O3 (100)表面上，C-H键活化发生在表面氧从丙烷分子中提取氢原子时，形成与Ga表面位点和羟基配位的丙基物种。

虽然文献提供了关于β-Ga2O3的见解，但缺乏在CO2-ODHP反应中不同Ga2O3多形体（α-、β-、γ-和δ-）之间的全面比较。需要进行更多研究以充分了解各种Ga2O3多形体的行为及其随时间的性能变化，包括反应的初始和稳态阶段。
