[1] "β-Ga2O3 has a monoclinic structure, in which gallium atoms are equally distributed between tetrahedral and octahedral configurations. This crystal structure has a high concentration of weak Lewis acid sites (coordinatively unsaturated tetrahedral ones on the surface of the material), which are deemed to be centers of dehydrogenation activity."

[2] "Chen et al., who, by relating the results of NH3-TPD measurements with activity data for different GaxAl10xO15 mixed oxides, showed that a high concentration of Lewis acid groups in the form of coordinatively unsaturated tetrahedral Ga3+ cations is a prerequisite for dehydrogenation activity"

[3] "Michorczyk et al. concluded that acidic groups catalyze the reaction after observing that promotion with a base, such as potassium, resulted in a decrease in activity."

[4] "CO2 competitively adsorbs on the surface, specifically on the basic sites of the catalyst materials, which can negatively affect their performance."

The literature provides some insights into how the structural characteristics and surface properties of Ga2O3 influence its catalytic performance in dehydrogenation reactions, though it does not specifically discuss CO2-ODHP reactions or compare different Ga2O3 polymorphs.

β-Ga2O3, which has a monoclinic structure, is noted to have a high concentration of weak Lewis acid sites on its surface. These sites, which are coordinatively unsaturated tetrahedral Ga3+ cations, are considered to be the centers of dehydrogenation activity. 

The importance of Lewis acidity is further emphasized by studies on GaxAl10xO15 mixed oxides, which showed that a high concentration of Lewis acid groups is crucial for dehydrogenation activity. This suggests that the Lewis acidity of the catalyst surface plays a key role in the reaction mechanism.

The literature also indicates that acidic groups in general catalyze the dehydrogenation reaction. This was demonstrated by an experiment where the addition of a base (potassium) decreased the catalyst's activity.

Regarding the influence of basic sites, the literature mentions that CO2 competitively adsorbs on these sites, which can negatively affect the catalyst's performance. This suggests that while acidic sites are important for the dehydrogenation activity, the presence of basic sites might be detrimental in CO2-involving reactions.

The literature does not provide specific information on the mechanisms during initial and steady-state stages of the reaction, nor does it compare the performance of different Ga2O3 polymorphs (α-, β-, γ-, and δ-) in CO2-ODHP reactions. More research would be needed to fully answer these aspects of the question.

文献为我们提供了一些关于Ga2O3的结构特征和表面性质如何影响其在脱氢反应中的催化性能的见解，但并未具体讨论CO2-ODHP反应或比较不同的Ga2O3多形体。

β-Ga2O3具有单斜结构，其表面有高浓度的弱Lewis酸位点。这些位点是配位不饱和的四面体Ga3+阳离子，被认为是脱氢活性的中心。

Lewis酸性的重要性通过对GaxAl10xO15混合氧化物的研究得到进一步强调，这些研究表明高浓度的Lewis酸基团对脱氢活性至关重要。这表明催化剂表面的Lewis酸性在反应机理中起关键作用。

文献还指出，酸性基团通常会催化脱氢反应。这一点通过一个实验得到证实，即添加碱（钾）会降低催化剂的活性。

关于碱性位点的影响，文献提到CO2会在这些位点上进行竞争性吸附，这可能会对催化剂的性能产生负面影响。这表明虽然酸性位点对脱氢活性很重要，但在涉及CO2的反应中，碱性位点的存在可能是有害的。

文献没有提供关于反应初始和稳态阶段机理的具体信息，也没有比较不同Ga2O3多形体（α-、β-、γ-和δ-）在CO2-ODHP反应中的性能。要充分回答这些问题还需要更多的研究。
