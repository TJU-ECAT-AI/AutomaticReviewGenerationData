[1] "β-Ga2O3 has a monoclinic structure, in which gallium atoms are equally distributed between tetrahedral and octahedral configurations. This crystal structure has a high concentration of weak Lewis acid sites (coordinatively unsaturated tetrahedral ones on the surface of the material), which are deemed to be centers of dehydrogenation activity."

[2] "Chen et al. reported that a high concentration of Lewis acid groups in the form of coordinatively unsaturated tetrahedral Ga3+ cations is a prerequisite for dehydrogenation activity"

[3] "Michorczyk et al. concluded that acidic groups catalyze the reaction after observing that promotion with a base, such as potassium, resulted in a decrease in activity."

[4] "The addition of CO2 to the reactant feed improves the olefin yield."

[5] "Nakagawa et al. found that the addition of steam and CO2 decreased coke deposition on a Ga2O3/TiO2 catalyst by the Boudouart reaction, while also assisting ethylene desorption."

The literature primarily discusses the β-Ga2O3 polymorph and does not provide detailed information on the structural characteristics and catalytic performance of other Ga2O3 polymorphs (α-, γ-, and δ-) in CO2-ODHP reactions. However, based on the available information, we can draw some conclusions about the influence of structural characteristics and surface properties on catalytic performance:

1. Crystal structure: The β-Ga2O3 polymorph has a monoclinic structure with gallium atoms distributed equally between tetrahedral and octahedral configurations. This structure is associated with a high concentration of weak Lewis acid sites, which are important for dehydrogenation activity.

2. Lewis acid sites: The presence of coordinatively unsaturated tetrahedral Ga3+ cations on the surface acts as weak Lewis acid sites. These sites are considered crucial for dehydrogenation activity. A higher concentration of these Lewis acid groups correlates with improved catalytic performance.

3. Surface acidity: Acidic groups on the catalyst surface appear to play a significant role in the reaction mechanism. The observation that promotion with a base (potassium) decreased activity suggests that surface acidity is important for catalytic performance.

4. CO2 influence: The addition of CO2 to the feed improves olefin yield. This could be due to several mechanisms:
   a) CO2 may assist in ethylene desorption, improving product yield.
   b) CO2 may help decrease coke deposition through the Boudouart reaction, thereby maintaining catalyst activity.
   c) CO2 could act as a mild oxidant, shifting the equilibrium towards product formation.

5. Steam influence: The addition of steam, along with CO2, helps decrease coke deposition and assists in product desorption.

The proposed mechanisms for the observed activity trends and selectivity include:

1. Lewis acid site catalysis: The coordinatively unsaturated Ga3+ cations act as active sites for the dehydrogenation reaction.
2. Coke reduction: CO2 and steam help reduce coke formation and assist in maintaining catalyst activity over time.
3. Product desorption: CO2 and steam facilitate the desorption of products, improving overall yield.

It's important to note that the literature does not provide specific information on the initial versus steady-state stages of the reaction or detailed comparisons between different Ga2O3 polymorphs. Further research would be needed to fully understand the behavior of various Ga2O3 polymorphs in CO2-ODHP reactions and their performance over time.

文献主要讨论了β-Ga2O3多晶型，并未提供其他Ga2O3多晶型（α-、γ-和δ-）在CO2-ODHP反应中的结构特征和催化性能的详细信息。然而，根据可用信息，我们可以得出一些关于结构特征和表面性质对催化性能影响的结论：

1. 晶体结构：β-Ga2O3多晶型具有单斜结构，其中镓原子均匀分布在四面体和八面体构型中。这种结构与高浓度的弱Lewis酸位相关，这对脱氢活性很重要。

2. Lewis酸位：表面上存在的配位不饱和的四面体Ga3+阳离子作为弱Lewis酸位。这些位点被认为对脱氢活性至关重要。这些Lewis酸基团的浓度越高，催化性能越好。

3. 表面酸度：催化剂表面的酸性基团似乎在反应机理中起着重要作用。观察到用碱（钾）促进会降低活性，这表明表面酸度对催化性能很重要。

4. CO2的影响：向反应物中添加CO2可以提高烯烃产率。这可能是由于几种机制：
   a) CO2可能有助于乙烯脱附，提高产品产率。
   b) CO2可能通过Boudouart反应帮助减少积碳，从而维持催化剂活性。
   c) CO2可能作为温和的氧化剂，将平衡向产物形成方向移动。

5. 蒸汽的影响：添加蒸汽和CO2有助于减少积碳并协助产物脱附。

观察到的活性趋势和选择性的提议机制包括：

1. Lewis酸位催化：配位不饱和的Ga3+阳离子作为脱氢反应的活性位点。
2. 积碳减少：CO2和蒸汽有助于减少积碳形成，并有助于维持催化剂活性。
3. 产物脱附：CO2和蒸汽促进产物的脱附，提高整体产率。

需要注意的是，文献没有提供关于反应初始阶段与稳态阶段的具体信息，也没有详细比较不同Ga2O3多晶型。需要进一步研究才能充分了解各种Ga2O3多晶型在CO2-ODHP反应中的行为及其随时间的性能变化。
