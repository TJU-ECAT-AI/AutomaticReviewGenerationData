[1] "β-Ga2O3 has a monoclinic structure, in which gallium atoms are equally distributed between tetrahedral and octahedral configurations. This crystal structure has a high concentration of weak Lewis acid sites (coordinatively unsaturated tetrahedral ones on the surface of the material), which are deemed to be centers of dehydrogenation activity."

[2] "Chen et al. reported that a high concentration of Lewis acid groups in the form of coordinatively unsaturated tetrahedral Ga3+ cations is a prerequisite for dehydrogenation activity"

[3] "Michorczyk et al. concluded that acidic groups catalyze the reaction after observing that promotion with a base, such as potassium, resulted in a decrease in activity."

[4] "CO2 competitively adsorbs on the surface, specifically on the basic sites of the catalyst materials, which can negatively affect their performance."

The literature does not provide comprehensive information on the catalytic performance of different Ga2O3 polymorphs in CO2-ODHP reactions. However, some insights can be drawn from the available information on Ga2O3 catalysts in dehydrogenation reactions:

1. Structure: β-Ga2O3, which has a monoclinic structure with gallium atoms distributed between tetrahedral and octahedral configurations, is mentioned as an active phase for dehydrogenation reactions.

2. Lewis acid sites: The catalytic activity is strongly associated with the presence of weak Lewis acid sites, specifically coordinatively unsaturated tetrahedral Ga3+ cations on the surface. A high concentration of these sites is considered crucial for dehydrogenation activity.

3. Surface acidity: Acidic groups on the catalyst surface are believed to catalyze the reaction. This is supported by the observation that adding a base (potassium) decreased the catalytic activity.

4. Effect of CO2: In CO2-ODHP reactions, CO2 competitively adsorbs on the basic sites of the catalyst, which can negatively impact performance. This suggests that the balance between acidic and basic sites is important for catalyst activity and selectivity.

5. Reaction mechanisms: While specific mechanisms for CO2-ODHP are not provided, it can be inferred that the reaction likely involves the interaction of the alkane with Lewis acid sites (Ga3+ cations), followed by C-H bond activation. The presence of CO2 may influence the reaction by competing for adsorption sites and potentially participating in the oxidation step.

6. Initial vs. steady-state performance: The literature does not provide specific information on how the catalyst performance changes from initial to steady-state conditions in CO2-ODHP reactions.

To fully answer the question, more research specifically focused on comparing different Ga2O3 polymorphs in CO2-ODHP reactions would be needed.

文献中并没有提供关于不同Ga2O3多形体在CO2-ODHP反应中催化性能的全面信息。但是，从可获得的Ga2O3催化剂在脱氢反应中的信息可以得出一些见解：

1. 结构：β-Ga2O3具有单斜结构，其中镓原子分布在四面体和八面体构型之间，被提及为脱氢反应的活性相。

2. 路易斯酸位点：催化活性与表面上存在的弱路易斯酸位点，特别是配位不饱和的四面体Ga3+阳离子密切相关。这些位点的高浓度被认为是脱氢活性的关键。

3. 表面酸度：催化剂表面的酸性基团被认为可以催化反应。这一点得到了观察到添加碱（钾）会降低催化活性的支持。

4. CO2的影响：在CO2-ODHP反应中，CO2与催化剂的碱性位点竞争性吸附，这可能会对性能产生负面影响。这表明酸性和碱性位点之间的平衡对催化剂的活性和选择性很重要。

5. 反应机理：虽然没有提供CO2-ODHP的具体机理，但可以推断反应可能涉及烷烃与路易斯酸位点（Ga3+阳离子）的相互作用，随后发生C-H键活化。CO2的存在可能通过与吸附位点竞争并可能参与氧化步骤来影响反应。

6. 初始vs稳态性能：文献没有提供关于催化剂性能在CO2-ODHP反应中从初始到稳态条件如何变化的具体信息。

要全面回答这个问题，需要进行更多专门比较不同Ga2O3多形体在CO2-ODHP反应中性能的研究。
