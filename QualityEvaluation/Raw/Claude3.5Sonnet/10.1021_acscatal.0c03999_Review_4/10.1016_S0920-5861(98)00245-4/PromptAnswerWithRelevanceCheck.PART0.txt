Read the questions and answers provided below. First, critically assess the overall relevance of the answers provided to the set of questions asked.

If, upon your assessment, you find that the answers do not contain information that is relevant to the questions asked, stop your review process immediately and respond with a single sentence: "※※※※※※※The provided answers are not relevant to the questions.※※※※※※※". Do not provide any additional explanation or background information, only this sentence should be given as a response in case of irrelevant answers.

If, however, the answers are relevant to the questions asked, proceed to compile answers for each question according to the instructions below. Ensure to aggregate all the relevant answers from the multiple answer results provided in the document, and organize them sequentially by their order number, compiling the corresponding quotes, English answers, and Chinese answers for each question.

If the provided answers' quotes are not differentiated by question, ensure to break them down and assign the quotes to each respective question, outputting them separately within each question's section.

To provide a comprehensive review, differentiate the responses into quotes, English answers, and Chinese answers for each question based on the details given in the 'Answer' XML tags. Structure your review using the XML format showcased below if the answers are relevant to the questions asked:

<questions>

How do the structural characteristics, surface properties (particularly acidity and basicity), and Lewis acid sites of different Ga2O3 polymorphs (α-, β-, γ-, and δ-) influence their catalytic performance in CO2-ODHP reactions, and what mechanisms are proposed to explain the observed activity trends and selectivity during both initial and steady-state stages of the reaction?

<EnglishVersionAnswer>

The given literature does not contain any information about Ga2O3 polymorphs or their catalytic performance in CO2-ODHP reactions. The text focuses on the effects of CO2 on propane dehydrogenation over chromium oxide (Cr2O3) catalysts supported on different materials, primarily SiO2. It does not discuss gallium oxide or its polymorphs. Therefore, this question cannot be answered based on the provided document.

</EnglishVersionAnswer>

<ChineseVersionAnswer>

所提供的文献不包含任何关于Ga2O3多晶型或它们在CO2-ODHP反应中的催化性能的信息。该文本主要关注CO2对不同载体上的氧化铬(Cr2O3)催化剂进行丙烷脱氢的影响，主要是SiO2载体。它没有讨论氧化镓或其多晶型。因此，无法根据提供的文档回答这个问题。
