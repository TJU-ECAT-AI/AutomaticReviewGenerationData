 Introduction
Mesoporous
 (250
 nm)
 structures
 can
 serve
 as
 robust
 templates
for
 incorporation
 of
 quantum-confined
 inorganic
 semiconductor
sensitizers
 [1],  and
 have
 been
 widely
 used
 in
 the
 area
 of
 molecu-
lar
 separation,
 sorption
 or
 as
 catalysts
 and
 catalyst
 supports
 [2].
Because
 of
 their
 uniquely
 larger
 specific
 surface
 area,
 continu-
ous
 pore
 channels,
 and
 multiple
 scattering
 structures,
 mesoporous
materials
 have
 been
 widely
 used
 as
 photocatalysts
 of
 high
 light
harvesting
 and
 fast
 mass
 transfer
 rate
 [3].
Wide
 bandgap
 metal
 oxide
 photocatalysts
 such
 as
 -Ga2O3
(Eg =
 4.9
 eV)
 [4]
 and
 ZnGa2O4 (Eg =
 4.45.0
 eV)
 [5]
 bear
 dispersive
conduction
 band,
 which
 can
 promote
 the
 mobility
 of
 the
 photo-
generated
 electrons
 and
 enhance
 the
 charge
 separation
 [6].  As
 a
result,
 these
 photocatalysts
 show
 exceptional
 performance
 in
 pho-
tocatalytic
 oxidation
 of
 volatile
 organic
 compounds
 (VOCs)
 into
harmless
 compounds
 such
 as
 carbon
 dioxide
 and
 water.
 Recently,
1-dimensional
 -Ga2O3 such
 as
 nanowires
 and
 nanorods
 has
attracted
 increasing
 attention
 for
 its
 unique
 nanostructure
 and
photocatalytic
 properties.
 Many
 synthesis
 methods
 have
 been
 pro-
posed,
 including
 microwave
 plasma
 [7],  arc
 discharge
 method
 [8],

thermal
 evaporation
 [9],  carbothermal
 reduction
 [10],
 hydrother-
mal
 method
 [11],
 and
 solgel
 method
 [4].  In
 particular,
 the
hydrothermal
 method
 has
 elicited
 great
 interest
 in
 preparing
 uni-
form
 and
 stable
 catalysts
 because
 it
 is
 a
 simple
 wet
 chemical
process
 and
 can
 be
 carried
 out
 at
 low
 temperatures
 [12].
High
 surface
 area
 mesoporous
 nano-
 or
 micro-structures
 are
believed
 to
 offer
 much
 improved
 photocatalytic
 activity
 than
conventional
 low-surface
 area
 counterparts,
 especially
 in
 multi-
phase
 photocatalytic
 systems
 [13].
 In
 such
 systems,
 the
 reaction
rate
 of
 gassolid
 heterogeneous
 photocatalysis
 is
 often
 limited
 by
mass-transfer
 processes
 on
 the
 catalyst
 surface
 [14].
 For
 instance,
mesoporous
 TiO2 [15]
 and
 zeolite-supported
 TiO2 with
 a
 larger
surface
 area
 showed
 efficient
 photocatalytic
 activity,
 especially
 for
gas
 phase
 reactions
 [16].
 Therefore,
 developing
 porous
 -Ga2O3
with
 a
 larger
 surface
 area
 is
 of
 great
 scientific
 and
 practical
 signi-
ficance.
Surfactant
 templating
 has
 provided
 a
 breakthrough
 methodol-
ogy
 for
 preparation
 of
 a
 number
 of
 mesoporous
 materials
 with
a
 variety
 of
 mesophases,
 2-
 or
 3-dimensional
 pore
 networks
and
 diverse
 tunable
 properties
 [17].
 Of
 various
 surfactants
 used,
polyethyl
 glycol
 (PEG)
 is
 an
 important
 templating
 reagent
 for
 syn-
thesizing
 mesoporous
 nanomaterials
 [18].
The
 overall
 goal
 of
 this
 study
 was
 to
 prepare
 and
 character-
ize
 a
 class
 of
 PEG-modified
 -Ga2O3 mesoporous
 nanorods
 by
 a
modified
 hydrothermal
 method
 toward
 the
 photocatalytic
 oxida-
tion
 of
 VOCs.
 The
 specific
 objectives
 were
 to:
 (1)

 of

 and
 the

 of

 Experimental
2.1.
 Materials
 and
 synthesis
All
 chemicals
 were
 used
 as
 purchased
 without
 further
 purifi-
cation
 in
 this
 study.
 The
 nanoscale
 -Ga2O3 rods
 were
 prepared
via
 the
 PEG
 assisted
 hydrothermal
 method.
 In
 a
 typical
 synthe-
sis
 process,
 1.6
 g
 Ga(NO3)3Â·9H2O
 (AR,
 Longjin
 Material,
 China),
2.64
 g
 urea
 (AR,
 Sinopharm
 Chemical
 Reagent,
 China),
 and
 20
 mL
PEG
 (AR,
 Gaonan
 Chemical
 Reagent,
 China)
 were
 dissolved
 into
70
 mL
 of
 deionized
 water
 and
 then
 stirred
 vigorously
 for
 2
 h
 at
25
 
 1 C.
 The
 solution
 was
 then
 transferred
 into
 a
 Teflon-lined
stainless
 steel
 autoclave
 (100
 mL
 in
 capacity)
 and
 hydrothermally
reacted
 at
 140 C
 for
 6
 h.
 After
 the
 reaction,
 the
 white
 precipitates
were
 filtrated
 and
 washed
 with
 deionized
 water
 and
 then
 absolute
ethanol
 for
 35
 times
 in
 order
 to
 remove
 any
 possible
 impurities.
The
 material
 was
 then
 calcined
 at
 800 C
 for
 2
 h
 in
 a
 muffle
 fur-
nace
 to
 acquire
 the
 desired
 nanostructured
 of
 -Ga2O3 nanorods.
Commercial
 P25
 TiO2 (Degussa,
 Germany)
 was
 used
 as
 the
 control
catalyst.
2.2.
 Characterizations
 and
 measurements
The
 morphologies
 of
 the
 samples
 were
 investigated
 by
 a
 scan-
ning
 electron
 microscopy
 (SEM)
 (Model
 S-570,
 Hitachi,
 Japan),
the
 nanostructure
 and
 crystalline
 of
 samples
 were
 examined
by
 a
 transmission
 electron
 microscopy
 (TEM),
 a
 high-resolution
transmission
 electron
 microscopy
 (HRTEM),
 and
 a
 selected
 area
electron
 diffraction
 (SAED)
 (JEM-2010,
 Jeol,
 Japan)
 at
 an
 accel-
erating
 voltage
 of
 200
 kV.
 The
 photoluminescence
 (PL)
 spectra
were
 measured
 at
 25
 
 1 C
 with
 a
 fluorospectrophotometer
(Fluorolog-3-Tau,
 France)
 using
 a
 Xe
 lamp
 as
 the
 excitation
source.
2.3.
 Online
 detection
 of
 photocatalytic
 oxidation
 intermediates
The
 photocatalytic
 oxidation
 intermediates
 were
 monitored
 in
 a
continuous
 flow-through
 reactor
 (30
 mL)
 made
 of
 Teflon
 and
 quartz
glass
 (transmittance
 wavelength
 >
 250
 nm)
 irradiated
 with
 three
4
 W
 monochrome
 UV-lamps
 (G4T5L,
 Yaguang,
 China)
 over
 quartz
glass
 at
 25
 
 1 C.
 The
 intermediates
 were
 analyzed
 online
 using
PTR-MS
 (Ionicon
 Analytik,
 Austria).
 See

 of
 Supplementary
Information
 for
 further

2.4.
 Photocatalytic
 activity
 tests
Photocatalytic
 oxidation
 of
 toluene,
 a
 typical
 indoor
 air
 pollu-
tant,
 was
 chosen
 as
 the
 probe
 reaction
 to
 characterize
 the
 activity
of
 the
 as-prepared
 samples
 [19].
 Another
 reactor
 was
 also
 equipped
with
 four
 2
 W
 monochrome
 UV-lamps
 (G2T5L,
 Yaguang,
 China)
with
 a
 light
 emission
 wavelength
 of
 254
 nm.
 The
 initial
 concen-
tration
 of
 toluene
 was
 controlled
 at
 160
 or
 200
 ppm
 taking
 into
account
 the
 adsorption
 equilibrium
 of
 toluene
 with
 the
 catalyst
 in
the
 reactor,
 and
 the
 concentration
 of
 toluene
 was
 analyzed
 by
 a
GC-FID
 (9790,
 Fuli,
 China).
 There
 was
 no
 degradation
 observed
 in
the
 absence
 of
 the
 catalyst.

 Results
 and
 discussion
3.1.
 Photocatalyst
 characterizations
The
 diffraction
 peaks
 in
 the
 XRD
 patterns
 (Fig.
 S1a
 and
 b)
 can
 be
indexed
 to
 the
 precursor
 GaOOH
 and
 monoclinic
 -Ga2O3 accord-
ing
 to
 JCPDS:
 06-0180
 and
 JCPDS:
 41-1103,
 respectively.
Fig.

 shows
 the
 morphology
 and
 structure
 of
 the
 as-prepared
 -
Ga2O3 with
 SEM
 and
 TEM
 (HRTEM).
 Fig.

 shows
 the
 SEM
 image
 of
the
 -Ga2O3 nanorods
 which
 exhibits
 a
 diamond
 crossing-section
with
 two
 60and
 two
 120angles.
 Also,
 there
 are
 many
 nanoscale
holes/cavities
 on
 the
 surface
 of
 the
 samples,
 which
 is
 similar
 to
the
 quadrilateral
 -Ga2O3 prisms
 reported
 by
 Zhang
 et
 al.
 [11].
 It
 is
also
 evident
 that
 the
 -Ga2O3 nanorod
 grew
 along
 the
 [1

 direc-
tion.
 Fig.
 1bd
 shows
 the
 TEM
 images
 of
 the
 -Ga2O3 nanorods.
The
 -Ga2O3 nanorods
 have
 an
 appearance
 of
 200300
 nm
 of
 each
side
 and
 1.01.2
 m
 in
 length
 with
 dense
 nanoholes
 whose
 average
diameter
 is
 ca.
 20
 nm.
 The
 HRTEM
 images

 the
clear

 and
 (4

 lattice
 fringes
 with
 the
 interplanar
spacing
 of
 0.25,
 0.37,
 and
 0.28
 nm,
 respectively.
 The
 SAED
 pattern
in
 Fig.
 1e
 (inset)
 shows
 intense
 electron
 diffraction
 rings,
 consis-
tent
 with
 the
 partial
 crystallinity
 of
 the
 -Ga2O3 walls
 as
 reported
by
 West
 et
 al.
 [20].
 The
 EDX
 spectrum
 (Fig.
 S2)
 indicates
 the
 peaks
of
 Ga,
 O,
 and
 N.
 The
 atomic
 ratio
 of
 gallium
 to
 oxygen
 is
 about
 2:
2.87.
 Compared
 to
 the
 stoichiometric
 of
 Ga2O3,
 there
 are
 4.3%
 oxy-
gen
 vacancies
 in
 the
 -Ga2O3 nanorods
 [21].
 A
 small
 amount
 of
N
 impurity
 comes
 from
 the
 urea,
 which
 is
 doped
 during
 sample
calcining
 at
 800 C.
 Although
 C
 dopant
 is
 expected
 to
 result
 from
urea
 and
 PEG
 during
 the
 hydrothermal
 process,
 it
 is
 not
 detected
possibly
 due
 to
 its
 relatively
 high
 detection
 limit
 (0.5%).
The
 surface
 area
 of
 the
 -Ga2O3 is
 determined
 to
 be
 28.98
 m2/g,
and
 the
 pore
 size
 of
 the
 sample
 predominantly
 falls
 in
 the
 meso-
porous
 range
 from
 10
 to
 50
 nm
 (Fig.
 S3).
The
 direct
 bandgap
 of
 the
 -Ga2O3 nanorods
 (Fig.
 S4)  is
 about
4.4
 eV,
 which
 is
 a
 little
 bit
 narrower
 than
 4.9
 eV
 reported
 by
 Hou
et
 al.
 [4].  N
 doping
 can
 form
 new
 states
 just
 above
 the
 valence
 band
for
 substitutional
 or
 interstitial
 nitrogen,
 which
 could
 narrow
 down
the
 bandgap
 of
 -Ga2O3 by
 mixing
 the
 N
 2p
 with
 O
 2p
 states,
 and
this
 is
 similar
 to
 the
 findings
 with
 N
 doped
 TiO2 in
 our
 previous
studies
 [19,22].
3.2.
 Intermediates
 of
 photocatalytic
 oxidation
 process
Fig.
 2
 shows
 the
 distribution
 of
 intermediates
 during
 TiO2 and
 -
Ga2O3 facilitated
 photocatalytic
 oxidation
 of
 toluene
 and
 the
 health
risk
 index
 (HRI)
 values.
 In
 order
 to
 evaluate
 adverse
 negative
 effects
of
 the
 intermediates,
 HRI
 for
 the
 intermediates
 was
 employed
 on
the
 model
 introduced
 by
 Mo  et
 al.
 [23].
 A
 health
 risk
 influence
 index
 can
 be
 deduced
 as
 follows:
 =
HRIi,outlet
HRIi,inlet
=
(Ci/RELi)outlet
(Ci/RELi)inlet
(1)
where
 HRIi,outlet and
 HRIi,inlet are
 the
 sum
 of
 HRI
 values
 of
the
 gaseous
 intermediates
 in
 the
 outlet
 and
 inlet
 gases,
 respec-
tively.
 The
 recommended
 exposure
 limit
 (REL)
 of
 compound
 i
 was
obtained
 from
 the
 toxicity
 database
 of
 Integrated
 Risk
 Information
System
 (IRIS)
 [24].
 The
 values
 of
 REL
 of
 different
 intermediates
 were
listed
 in
 Table
 S1.
 A
 value
 of
 
 >
 1,
 <1,
 and
 =1
 indicates
 that
 the
health
 risk
 of
 the
 intermediates
 formed
 in
 photocatalytic
 oxidation
is
 higher,
 lower,
 and
 equal
 to
 their
 parent
 compound,
 respectively.
Fig.
 2a
 shows
 the
 distribution
 of
 intermediates
 for
 both
 TiO2 and
-Ga2O3 (optimized
 with
 20
 mL
 PEG200)
 catalysts.
 The
 intermedi-
ates
 include
 formaldehyde,
 methanol,
 acetaldehyde,
 1,3-butadiene,
acraldehyde,
 acetone,
 and
 acetic
 acid.
 These
 intermediates
 are

 in
 the

to
 the
 gaseous
 phase.
 Formaldehyde
 and
 acetaldehyde
 are
 con-
sidered
 more
 toxic
 than
 toluene
 [24].
 It
 is
 evident
 that
 -Ga2O3
produced
 much
 less
 percentage
 of
 toxic
 intermediates
 such
 as
acetaldehyde
 and
 formaldehyde
 than
 the
 TiO2 counterpart.
 In
 fact,
-Ga2O3 resulted
 in
 more
 percentage
 of
 benign
 intermediates
 such
as
 methanol,
 1,3-butadiene,
 and
 acetic
 acid
 than
 TiO2.
 Methanol
 is
the
 predominant
 intermediate
 for
 -Ga2O3,
 accounting
 for
 36.1%
of
 the
 total
 intermediates.
 In
 contrast,
 acetaldehyde
 accounts
 for
60.0%
 of
 the
 intermediates
 for
 TiO2.
 Evidently,
 -Ga2O3 can
 lead
to
 more
 reduced
 production
 of
 acetaldehyde
 and
 formaldehyde
 in
the
 photocatalytic
 oxidation
 process
 than
 TiO2.
 Although
 -Ga2O3
modestly
 increases
 the
 percentage
 concentration
 of
 acraldehyde
and
 1,3-butadiene,
 this
 drawback
 is
 outweighed
 by
 the
 con-
version
 of
 much
 greater
 fractions
 of
 innocuous
 acetic
 acid
 and
alcohol.
Fig.
 2b
 shows
 the
 HRI
 and
 
 values
 increased
 from
 174
 and
 9.6
 for
-Ga2O3 to
 290
 and
 17.7
 for
 TiO2,
 respectively.
 Evidently,
 the
 wide
bandgap
 -Ga2O3 can
 serve
 as
 a
 cleaner
 photocatalyst
 than
 TiO2
based
 on
 the
 toxicity
 analysis
 of
 the
 intermediates.
 This
 difference
can
 be
 attributed
 to
 the
 difference
 in
 the
 band
 structures
 between
-Ga2O3 with
 TiO2.
Typically,
 photocatalytic
 processes
 are
 controlled
 by
 two
 path-
ways:
 hydroxyl
 radical
 (â¢OH)
 oxidation
 and
 photoinduced
 holes
oxidation
 [25,26]. The â¢OH
 produced
 from
 water
 is
 controlled
by
 the
 water
 molecular
 on
 the
 surface
 of
 the
 photocatalysts
 or
the
 RH
 of
 gas,
 while
 photoinduced
 holes
 oxidation
 properties
 are
strongly
 dependent
 on
 the
 structural
 and
 electronic
 properties
 of
the
 photocatalysts.
 The
 wider
 bandgap
 of
 -Ga2O3 endows
 the
 pho-
togenerated
 holes
 with
 stronger
 oxidation
 potentials
 [27,28]. The
electron
 holes
 can
 either
 react
 with
 surface
 adsorbed
 H2O
 to
 give
more â¢OH
 or
 directly
 transfer
 electrons
 from
 the
 target
 pollutants
to
 the
 holes,
 leading
 to
 highly
 oxidized
 compounds
 such
 as
 organic
acids
 or
 alcohol
 which
 are
 less
 toxic.

same
 hydrothermal

 but
 with
 PEGs
 of
 various
 M.W.
 The
samples
 prepared
 with
 PEG
 of
 different
 M.W.
 exhibit
 an
 obvious
PL
 signal
 with
 a
 similar
 curve
 shape,
 demonstrating
 that
 the
 PEGs
do
 not
 result
 in
 a
 new
 PL
 phenomenon.
 All
 of
 the
 PL
 spectra
 are
strong
 at
 the
 wavelength
 ranging
 from
 300
 to
 800
 nm,
 with
 three
obvious
 PL
 peaks
 at
 about
 455,
 690,
 and
 710
 nm,
 respectively.
 The
spectra
 are
 deconvoluted
 with
 four
 Gaussian
 curves
 with
 peaks
 at
450,
 520,
 695,
 and
 720
 nm.
 A
 strong
 blue
 PL
 emission
 is
 centered
 at
ca.
 450
 nm.
 The
 blue
 luminescence
 in
 -Ga2O3 can
 be
 attributed
 to
vacancies
 such
 as
 gallium
 vacancies
 (VGa),
 oxygen
 vacancies
 (VO),
and
 gallium-oxygen
 vacancy
 pairs
 (VO,
 VGa)
 [29].
 The
 EDX
 spectrum
of
 -Ga2O3 in
 Fig.
 S2
 proves
 that
 there
 are
 oxygen
 defects.
 There-
fore,
 the
 blue
 luminescence
 should
 be
 attributed
 to
 the
 oxygen
vacancies
 VO.
 The
 Gaussian
 curves
 with
 peaks
 at
 520
 nm
 should
 be
gallium-oxygen
 vacancy
 pairs
 (VO,
 VGa)
 [30,31]. Another
 two
 peaks
centered
 at
 695
 and
 720
 nm
 should
 be
 attributed
 to
 carbon
 and
nitrogen
 dopants
 resulting
 from
 urea
 and
 PEG
 in
 the
 hydrothermal
process,
 respectively.
 The
 carbon
 and
 nitrogen
 doping
 generates
deep
 acceptor
 levels
 in
 the
 bandgap
 of
 -Ga2O3,
 and
 the
 posi-
tion
 of
 the
 doping-induced
 sub-bands
 is
 around
 at
 the
 center
 of
the
 bandgap.
 The
 electron
 traps
 on
 a
 donor
 and
 the
 hole
 trapped
on
 an
 acceptor
 will
 recombine
 radiatively,
 emitting
 photons
 with
wavelength
 around
 695
 and
 720
 nm.
 It
 was
 reported
 that
 nitro-
gen
 dopants
 acted
 as
 electron
 acceptors
 in
 -Ga2O3 inducing
 holes
traps
 and
 it
 recombined
 with
 electrons
 trapped
 at
 oxygen
 vacancy
donors,
 generating
 red-light
 emission
 [32].
 The
 decrease
 in
 the
 rep-
resentative
 photoluminescence
 intensity
 at
 450
 nm
 indicates
 that
the
 intersystem
 crossing
 of
 excitons
 is
 hindered
 as
 a
 consequence
 of
weakening
 spin
 orbital
 coupling
 as
 the
 M.W.
 of
 PEG
 increases
 [33].
As
 a
 result,
 fewer
 electrons
 in
 the
 excited
 singlet
 jump
 into
 the
triplet
 state
 by
 the
 intersystem
 crossing,
 which
 leads
 to
 less
 effi-
cient
 photoluminescence.
 The
 PEG
 with
 higher
 M.W.
 should
 have
longer
 molecular
 chain,
 which
 makes
 the
 molecular
 itself
 coiled
or
 spiraled
 with
 other
 PEG
 molecules
 via
 hydrogen
 bonding
 in
 the
solution
 and
 leads
 to
 lessened
 effective
 number
 of
 PEG
 and
 surface
area
 that
 could
 interact
 with
 GaOOH.
 Consequently,
 fewer
 oxygen
vacancies
 would
 be
 produced,
 and
 thus
 the
 PL
 intensity
 decreases
with
 increasing
 M.W.
 of
 PEG
 template.
 However,
 the
 PL
 intensity
is
 not
 only
 related
 with
 the
 concentration
 of
 vacancies,
 but
 also
the
 distribution
 of
 vacancies.
 The
 uneven
 distribution
 of
 vacancies
may
 cause
 uneven
 absorption
 of
 photons,
 resulting
 in
 decreased
emission
 of
 luminescence.
Notably,
 as
 can
 be
 seen
 from
 Fig.
 S5,
 the
 samples
 prepared
 by
different
 M.W.
 of
 PEG
 are
 all
 diamond
 rodlike,
 indicating
 that
 there
is
 no
 obvious
 effect
 on
 the
 morphology
 of
 samples.
 The
 activity
 of
-Ga2O3 synthesized
 by
 PEG200
 (PEG
 of
 M.W.
 =
 200)
 shows
 the
biggest
 BET
 surface
 area
 (29.0
 m2/g)
 and
 the
 strongest
 catalytic
activity.
 The
 photocatalytic
 activity
 decreases
 with
 increasing
 M.W.
of
 PEG
 (see
 Fig.
 S6
 and
 the
 details).

surface
 area
 of
 -Ga2O3 nanorods
 prepared
 at
 various
 dosage
 of
PEG200.
 The
 crystallite
 size
 continuously
 decreases
 and
 the
 surface
area
 increases
 to
 the
 optimum
 value
 of
 29.0
 m2/g
 when
 the
 addition
of
 PEG200
 is
 increased
 to
 20
 mL.
 However,
 further
 increase
 of
 PEG
 to
60
 mL  sharply
 decreases
 the
 BET
 surface
 area
 to
 10.6
 m2/g,
 which
can
 be
 attributed
 to
 the
 unstable
 pore
 structure
 induced
 by
 the
burnout
 of
 PEG200
 at
 particularly
 high
 concentrations,
 where
 most
of
 the
 mesoporous
 framework
 could
 be
 easily
 damaged
 upon
 ther-
mal  treatment,
 resulting
 in
 considerable
 aggregation
 and
 structure
defects
 of
 crystals
 and
 a
 sharp
 decrease
 of
 surface
 area.
 Therefore,
the
 dosage
 of
 PEG
 is
 also
 an
 important
 factor
 to
 control
 the
 crystal
size
 and
 nanostructure
 of
 -Ga2O3 nanorods.
Fig.
 3b
 shows
 the
 PL
 spectra
 of
 -Ga2O3 nanorods
 synthesized
with
 different
 dosage
 of
 PEG200
 using
 the
 excitation
 light
 of
 260
 nm
at
 300
 K.
 It
 shows
 that
 the
 PEG
 dosage
 has
 a
 great
 effect
 on
 the
PL
 intensity
 of
 the
 -Ga2O3 nanorods.
 The
 PL
 intensity
 increases
with
 increasing
 PEG
 content
 and
 reaches
 the
 highest
 degree
 at
 PEG
dosage
 of
 20
 mL.
 When
 the
 PEG
 dosage
 is
 higher
 than
 60
 mL,
 the
PL
 intensity
 drops
 sharply,
 this
 is
 in
 accord
 with
 the
 XRD
 findings
in
 Fig.
 S7.
 The
 spectra
 are
 deconvoluted
 with
 three
 or
 four
 Gaus-
sian
 curves.
 Fig.
 3b
 shows
 that
 there
 are
 three
 Gaussian
 curves
with
 peaks
 at
 490,
 695,
 and
 730
 nm
 of
 PL
 spectra
 for
 the
 samples
synthesized
 without
 PEG200,
 which
 is
 different
 from
 those
 for
 sam-
ples
 synthesized
 with
 1
 and
 20
 mL  PEG200
 at
 450,
 510
 (530),
 695,
and
 730
 nm.
 For
 the
 sample
 without
 PEG,
 the
 weak
 peak
 at
 490
 nm
should
 be
 attributed
 to
 gallium-oxygen
 vacancy
 pairs
 (VO,
 VGa),
 as
this
 sample
 has
 a
 low
 concentration
 of
 oxygen
 vacancy.
 The
 two
Gaussian
 peaks
 at
 695
 and
 730
 nm
 in
 the
 PL
 spectra
 of
 the
 sam-
ple
 synthesized
 without
 PEG200
 indicate
 that
 urea
 can
 provide
 N
and
 C
 dopants.
 With
 the
 addition
 of
 PEG,
 the
 concentration
 of
 C
dopant
 in
 the
 samples
 increases,
 whereas
 the
 concentration
 of
 N
dopant
 remains
 constant.
 When
 the
 high
 dosage
 of
 PEG
 as
 60
 mL
of
 PEG200
 was
 added,
 it
 results
 in
 formation
 of
 micelles
 (the
 criti-
cal
 micelle
 concentration
 ca.
 20
 mL),
 which
 in
 turn
 lead
 to
 uneven
distribution
 of
 the
 vacancies,
 with
 weak
 vacancies
 being
 covered.
Consequently,
 only
 one
 Gaussian
 peak
 at
 720
 nm
 is
 evident.
 The
uneven
 distribution
 of
 vacancies
 can
 vary
 the
 Gaussian
 peaks
 which
are
 somewhat
 different
 showed
 in
 Fig.
 3b,
 and
 it
 makes
 some
Gaussian
 curves
 disappear
 or
 peaks
 shift.
 Therefore,
 the
 separation
abilities
 of
 photo-induced
 charges
 of
 -Ga2O3 can
 be
 improved
 by
modifying
 the
 content
 of
 PEG
 because
 the
 oxygen
 vacancies
 can
easily
 capture
 or
 bind
 photo-induced
 electrons.
Fig.
 4
 compares
 the
 photocatalytic
 activities
 of
 -Ga2O3 syn-
thesized
 with
 different
 dosage
 of
 PEG200
 at
 RH
 of
 45%
 and
 initial
toluene
 of
 200
 ppm.
 At
 the
 PEG200
 dosage
 of
 20
 mL,
 the
 activity
 of
-Ga2O3 is
 the
 highest
 (k
 =
 0.0785/min)
 which
 is
 in
 accord
 with
 the
results
 of
 PL
 spectra
 at
 450
 nm
 shown
 in
 Fig.
 3b.
 However,
 the
 PL
intensity
 of
 the
 sample
 with
 60
 mL  of
 PEG200
 is
 lower
 than
 that
without
 PEG200,
 but
 the
 photocatalytic
 activity
 of
 -Ga2O3 syn-
thesized
 with
 60
 mL  PEG200
 (k
 =
 0.0271/min)
 is
 higher
 than
 that
without
 PEG200
 (k
 =
 0.0086/min).
 Apparently,
 when
 the
 concen-
tration
 of
 oxygen
 vacancies
 is
 lower,
 the
 photocatalytic
 activity
correlates
 well
 with
 the
 PL
 intensity
 and
 oxygen
 vacancies.
 How-
ever,
 if
 the
 concentration
 of
 oxygen
 vacancies
 is
 higher,
 oxygen
vacancies
 become
 combination
 centers
 that
 decrease
 the
 photo-
catalytic
 activity.

 Formation
 mechanism
 of
 mesoporous
 -Ga2O3
According
 to
 the
 results
 above,
 the
 formation
 mechanism
 of
mesoporous
 -Ga2O3 nanorods
 is
 proposed
 in
 Fig.

 First,
 GaOOH
nanoparticles
 are
 produced
 when
 urea
 is
 slowly
 hydrolyzed
 into
 the
Fig.

weak
 base
 NH4OH
 and
 CO2 gas
 (Fig.
 S8).  The
 hydrophilic
 groups
 in
the
 polymeric
 chain
 of
 PEG
 are
 adsorbed
 on
 the
 surface
 of
 GaOOH
nanoparticles
 to
 minimize
 their
 surface
 energy,
 preventing
 rapid
aggregation
 of
 the
 particles.
 Consequently,
 GaOOH
 nanorods
 are
formed
 via
 oriented
 attachment
 [34].
 The
 SEM
 image
 (Fig.
 S5a)
shows
 that
 the
 -Ga2O3 particles
 can
 grow
 up
 into
 nonporous
nanorods
 without
 PEG,
 and
 mixed
 with
 miscellaneous
 shapes.
 PEG
plays
 an
 important
 role
 as
 a
 template
 in
 optimizing
 the
 growth
 ori-
entation
 and
 the
 growth
 rate
 in
 the
 formation
 of
 the
 crystallites.
Then,
 the
 crystallites
 grow
 further
 into
 diamond
 nanorods
 via
 Ost-
wald
 ripening
 [35].
 As
 the
 diamond
 nanorods
 grow
 mature,
 some
 of
the
 PEG
 and
 water
 molecules
 depart
 from
 the
 nanorods
 gradually.
After
 drying
 at
 80 C,
 the
 water
 molecules
 absorbed
 on
 the
 sur-
face
 of
 the
 products
 evaporate
 thoroughly,
 and
 later
 in
 the
 process
of
 calcination,
 PEG
 molecules
 evaporate
 completely
 at
 260270 C
leading
 to
 formation
 of
 the
 mesoporous
 nanorods.
 Then,
 the
 calci-
nation
 of
 the
 GaOOH
 nanorods
 results
 in
 -Ga2O3 by
 dehydration
at
 405 C,
 and
 then
 the
 perfect
 phase
 -Ga2O3 at
 800 C.
 Here
 the
high
 temperature
 can
 activate
 atoms
 in
 -Ga2O3,
 the
 remaining
PEG
 and
 urea
 molecules,
 so
 that
 N
 and
 C
 impurities
 with
 enough
energy
 could
 enter
 into
 the
 -Ga2O3 and
 replace
 the
 oxygen
 atoms.

 Conclusion
(1) Mesoporous
 -Ga2O3 diamond
 nanorods
 were
 synthesized
 via
a
 hydrothermal
 method
 using
 PEG
 as
 template.
 The
 PEG
 with
M.W.
 200
 and
 dosage
 of
 20
 mL  as
 the
 optimal
 condition
 gives
the
 largest
 BET
 surface
 area
 (29.0
 m2/g)
 and
 mean
 pore
 size
 of
30
 nm.
 Oxygen
 vacancies
 (VO),
 gallium-oxygen
 vacancy
 pairs
(VO,
 VGa),
 C
 and
 N
 dopants
 are
 the
 constituents
 of
 the
 PL
 peaks.

in
 
the

 The

 The
