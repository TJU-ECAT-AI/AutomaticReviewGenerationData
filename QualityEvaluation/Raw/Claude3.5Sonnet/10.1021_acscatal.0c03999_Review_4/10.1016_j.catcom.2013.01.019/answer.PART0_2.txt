[1] "It has been found that in DHP-CO2 process over the Ga-containing materials the selectivity to propene depends on two factors. The first factor is associated with the acidity which is determined either by the phase composition of Ga2O3 or by the properties of the support [13,15,16,19]. For example, over α- and β-Ga2O3 polymorphs propene was obtained with a higher selectivity in DHP-CO2 than over δ- and γ-Ga2O3 [15]."

[2] "The second factor is pore geometry which is important especially in the case of highly porous Ga-containing materials [19]."

The literature provides limited information on the specific influence of different Ga2O3 polymorphs on CO2-ODHP reactions. However, it does mention that the acidity and phase composition of Ga2O3 affect the selectivity to propene. Specifically, α- and β-Ga2O3 polymorphs showed higher selectivity to propene in DHP-CO2 reactions compared to δ- and γ-Ga2O3. 

The document does not provide detailed information on the structural characteristics, surface properties, or Lewis acid sites of different Ga2O3 polymorphs and their specific influence on catalytic performance. It also does not discuss proposed mechanisms to explain activity trends and selectivity during initial and steady-state stages of the reaction.

In addition to phase composition, the literature mentions that pore geometry is an important factor influencing catalytic performance, especially for highly porous Ga-containing materials. However, no specific mechanisms are proposed to explain these observations.

该文献对不同Ga2O3多形体在CO2-ODHP反应中的具体影响提供的信息有限。然而，它确实提到Ga2O3的酸度和相组成会影响对丙烯的选择性。具体而言，α-和β-Ga2O3多形体在DHP-CO2反应中表现出比δ-和γ-Ga2O3更高的丙烯选择性。

文献并未提供关于不同Ga2O3多形体的结构特征、表面性质或路易斯酸位点及其对催化性能的具体影响的详细信息。它也没有讨论解释反应初始和稳态阶段活性趋势和选择性的提议机制。

除了相组成外，文献还提到孔隙几何结构是影响催化性能的一个重要因素，特别是对于高孔隙度的含Ga材料。然而，没有提出具体的机制来解释这些观察结果。
