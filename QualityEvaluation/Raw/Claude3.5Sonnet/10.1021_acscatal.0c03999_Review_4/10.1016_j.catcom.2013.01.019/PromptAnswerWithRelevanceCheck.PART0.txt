How do the structural characteristics, surface properties (particularly acidity and basicity), and Lewis acid sites of different Ga2O3 polymorphs (α-, β-, γ-, and δ-) influence their catalytic performance in CO2-ODHP reactions, and what mechanisms are proposed to explain the observed activity trends and selectivity during both initial and steady-state stages of the reaction?

[1] "Over α- and β-Ga2O3 polymorphs propene was obtained with a higher selectivity in DHP-CO2 than over δ- and γ-Ga2O3 [15]."

[2] "It has been found that in DHP-CO2 process over the Ga-containing materials the selectivity to propene depends on two factors. The first factor is associated with the acidity which is determined either by the phase composition of Ga2O3 or by the properties of the support [13,15,16,19]."

</quotes>

<EnglishVersionAnswer>

The literature provides limited information on the specific influence of different Ga2O3 polymorphs on CO2-ODHP reactions. However, it does mention that α- and β-Ga2O3 polymorphs exhibit higher selectivity towards propene in DHP-CO2 reactions compared to δ- and γ-Ga2O3. The selectivity to propene in Ga-containing materials is influenced by acidity, which is determined by the phase composition of Ga2O3. 

The document does not provide detailed information on the structural characteristics, surface properties, or Lewis acid sites of different Ga2O3 polymorphs and their specific influence on catalytic performance. It also does not discuss proposed mechanisms to explain activity trends and selectivity during initial and steady-state stages of the reaction.

To fully answer this question, more detailed studies comparing the catalytic performance, structural characteristics, and surface properties of different Ga2O3 polymorphs in CO2-ODHP reactions would be needed.

文献对不同Ga2O3多形体在CO2-ODHP反应中的具体影响提供的信息有限。然而，它确实提到α-和β-Ga2O3多形体在DHP-CO2反应中表现出比δ-和γ-Ga2O3更高的丙烯选择性。在含Ga材料中，丙烯的选择性受酸度的影响，而酸度由Ga2O3的相组成决定。

文档没有提供不同Ga2O3多形体的结构特征、表面性质或Lewis酸位点及其对催化性能的具体影响的详细信息。它也没有讨论解释反应初始和稳态阶段活性趋势和选择性的提议机制。

要全面回答这个问题，需要更详细的研究来比较不同Ga2O3多形体在CO2-ODHP反应中的催化性能、结构特征和表面性质。

[1] "It has been found that in DHP-CO2 process over the Ga-containing materials the selectivity to propene depends on two factors. The first factor is associated with the acidity which is determined either by the phase composition of Ga2O3 or by the properties of the support [13,15,16,19]. For example, over α- and β-Ga2O3 polymorphs propene was obtained with a higher selectivity in DHP-CO2 than over δ- and γ-Ga2O3 [15]."

[2] "The second factor is pore geometry which is important especially in the case of highly porous Ga-containing materials [19]."

[3] "Since the XRD measurements prove that both Ga2O3m and Ga2O3-t have identical phase compositions (Table 1 and supplement Fig. 3S) we suspect that higher selectivity to propene over Ga2O3m is probably caused by its uniform mesopore structure with the higher order of pore size distribution."

</quotes>

<EnglishVersionAnswer>

The literature provides some insights into how structural characteristics and surface properties of different Ga2O3 polymorphs influence their catalytic performance in CO2-ODHP reactions:

1. Acidity, determined by the phase composition of Ga2O3, affects the selectivity to propene. α- and β-Ga2O3 polymorphs show higher selectivity to propene in DHP-CO2 compared to δ- and γ-Ga2O3.

2. Pore geometry is another important factor, especially for highly porous Ga-containing materials.

3. Uniform mesopore structure with a higher order of pore size distribution may lead to higher selectivity to propene, as observed in the case of Ga2O3m compared to Ga2O3-t with identical phase compositions.

The literature does not provide specific information on the influence of Lewis acid sites or detailed mechanisms to explain the observed activity trends during initial and steady-state stages of the reaction. More research would be needed to fully address these aspects of the question.

文献为不同Ga2O3多形体的结构特征和表面性质如何影响其在CO2-ODHP反应中的催化性能提供了一些见解：

1. 由Ga2O3的相组成决定的酸度影响了对丙烯的选择性。α-和β-Ga2O3多形体在DHP-CO2中表现出比δ-和γ-Ga2O3更高的丙烯选择性。

2. 孔隙几何结构是另一个重要因素，尤其对于高度多孔的含Ga材料。

3. 均匀的介孔结构和更高序的孔径分布可能导致更高的丙烯选择性，这在相组成相同的Ga2O3m和Ga2O3-t的比较中观察到。

文献没有提供关于Lewis酸位的影响或详细机制来解释在反应初始和稳态阶段观察到的活性趋势。需要进行更多研究以全面解答这些问题的方面。

The literature provides some insights into how different Ga2O3 polymorphs influence catalytic performance in CO2-ODHP reactions, but does not fully address all aspects of the question. 

The structural characteristics and acidity of different Ga2O3 polymorphs are reported to affect the selectivity to propene. Specifically, α- and β-Ga2O3 polymorphs show higher selectivity to propene compared to δ- and γ-Ga2O3 in the dehydrogenation of propane with CO2 (DHP-CO2). 

Pore geometry is also mentioned as an important factor for highly porous Ga-containing materials. Mesoporosity is suggested to facilitate the dehydrogenation reaction by allowing rapid diffusion of products, which may prevent side reactions and improve selectivity to propene.

However, the document does not provide detailed information on surface properties (particularly basicity), Lewis acid sites, or proposed mechanisms to explain activity trends and selectivity during initial and steady-state stages of the reaction for different Ga2O3 polymorphs. The influence of these factors on catalytic performance is not explicitly discussed in the given literature.

文献提供了一些关于不同Ga2O3多晶型如何影响CO2-ODHP反应中催化性能的见解，但并未全面涉及问题的所有方面。

据报道，不同Ga2O3多晶型的结构特征和酸性会影响丙烯的选择性。具体而言，在CO2存在下的丙烷脱氢（DHP-CO2）反应中，α-和β-Ga2O3多晶型表现出比δ-和γ-Ga2O3更高的丙烯选择性。

孔隙几何结构也被提及为高度多孔Ga含材料的一个重要因素。据推测，介孔结构通过允许产物快速扩散来促进脱氢反应，这可能会防止副反应并提高丙烯的选择性。

然而，该文献并未提供关于表面性质（特别是碱性）、Lewis酸位点的详细信息，也没有提出解释不同Ga2O3多晶型在反应初始和稳态阶段的活性趋势和选择性的机制。这些因素对催化性能的影响在给定的文献中并未被明确讨论。
