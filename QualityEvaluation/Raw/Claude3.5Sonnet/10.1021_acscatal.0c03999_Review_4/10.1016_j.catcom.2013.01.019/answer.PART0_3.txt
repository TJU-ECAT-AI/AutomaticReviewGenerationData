[1] "It has been found that in DHP-CO2 process over the Ga-containing materials the selectivity to propene depends on two factors. The first factor is associated with the acidity which is determined either by the phase composition of Ga2O3 or by the properties of the support [13,15,16,19]. For example, over α- and β-Ga2O3 polymorphs propene was obtained with a higher selectivity in DHP-CO2 than over δ- and γ-Ga2O3 [15]."

[2] "The second factor is pore geometry which is important especially in the case of highly porous Ga-containing materials [19]."

[3] "It is most likely that mesoporosity facilitates the dehydrogenation reaction due to the rapid diffusion of the products in the available space of the biggest pores preventing against side reactions, which could decrease the selectivity to propene."

The literature provides some insights into how different Ga2O3 polymorphs influence catalytic performance in CO2-ODHP reactions, but does not fully address all aspects of the question. 

The structural characteristics and acidity of different Ga2O3 polymorphs are reported to affect the selectivity to propene. Specifically, α- and β-Ga2O3 polymorphs show higher selectivity to propene compared to δ- and γ-Ga2O3 in the dehydrogenation of propane with CO2 (DHP-CO2). 

Pore geometry is also mentioned as an important factor for highly porous Ga-containing materials. Mesoporosity is suggested to facilitate the dehydrogenation reaction by allowing rapid diffusion of products, which may prevent side reactions and improve selectivity to propene.

However, the document does not provide detailed information on surface properties (particularly basicity), Lewis acid sites, or proposed mechanisms to explain activity trends and selectivity during initial and steady-state stages of the reaction for different Ga2O3 polymorphs. The influence of these factors on catalytic performance is not explicitly discussed in the given literature.

文献提供了一些关于不同Ga2O3多晶型如何影响CO2-ODHP反应中催化性能的见解，但并未全面涉及问题的所有方面。

据报道，不同Ga2O3多晶型的结构特征和酸性会影响丙烯的选择性。具体而言，在CO2存在下的丙烷脱氢（DHP-CO2）反应中，α-和β-Ga2O3多晶型表现出比δ-和γ-Ga2O3更高的丙烯选择性。

孔隙几何结构也被提及为高度多孔Ga含材料的一个重要因素。据推测，介孔结构通过允许产物快速扩散来促进脱氢反应，这可能会防止副反应并提高丙烯的选择性。

然而，该文献并未提供关于表面性质（特别是碱性）、Lewis酸位点的详细信息，也没有提出解释不同Ga2O3多晶型在反应初始和稳态阶段的活性趋势和选择性的机制。这些因素对催化性能的影响在给定的文献中并未被明确讨论。
