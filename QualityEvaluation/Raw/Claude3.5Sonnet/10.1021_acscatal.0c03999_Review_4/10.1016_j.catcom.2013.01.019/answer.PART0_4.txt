[1] "It has been found that in DHP-CO2 process over the Ga-containing materials the selectivity to propene depends on two factors. The first factor is associated with the acidity which is determined either by the phase composition of Ga2O3 or by the properties of the support [13,15,16,19]. For example, over α- and β-Ga2O3 polymorphs propene was obtained with a higher selectivity in DHP-CO2 than over δ- and γ-Ga2O3 [15]."

[2] "The second factor is pore geometry which is important especially in the case of highly porous Ga-containing materials [19]."

The literature provides limited information on the influence of different Ga2O3 polymorphs on CO2-ODHP reactions. However, it mentions that the acidity and phase composition of Ga2O3 affect the selectivity to propene. Specifically, α- and β-Ga2O3 polymorphs show higher selectivity to propene in DHP-CO2 reactions compared to δ- and γ-Ga2O3. Additionally, pore geometry is identified as another important factor influencing catalytic performance, especially for highly porous Ga-containing materials.

The document does not provide detailed information on the structural characteristics, surface properties (besides acidity), Lewis acid sites, or specific mechanisms to explain activity trends and selectivity during different stages of the reaction for various Ga2O3 polymorphs. More comprehensive research would be needed to fully address these aspects of the question.

文献对不同Ga2O3多形体在CO2-ODHP反应中的影响提供了有限的信息。但是，它提到Ga2O3的酸性和相组成会影响对丙烯的选择性。具体来说，在DHP-CO2反应中，α-和β-Ga2O3多形体对丙烯的选择性高于δ-和γ-Ga2O3。此外，孔隙几何结构被确定为另一个影响催化性能的重要因素，特别是对于高孔隙度的含Ga材料。

该文档没有提供关于各种Ga2O3多形体的结构特征、表面性质（除酸性外）、Lewis酸位点的详细信息，也没有提供解释反应不同阶段活性趋势和选择性的具体机制。要全面回答这些问题的各个方面，需要进行更深入的研究。
