          [1] "It has been found that in DHP-CO2 process over the Ga-containing materials the selectivity to propene depends on two factors. The first factor is associated with the acidity which is determined either by the phase composition of Ga2O3 or by the properties of the support [13,15,16,19]. For example, over α- and β-Ga2O3 polymorphs propene was obtained with a higher selectivity in DHP-CO2 than over δ- and γ-Ga2O3 [15]."

          [2] "The second factor is pore geometry which is important especially in the case of highly porous Ga-containing materials [19]."

          [3] "Since the XRD measurements prove that both Ga2O3m and Ga2O3-t have identical phase compositions (Table 1 and supplement Fig. 3S) we suspect that higher selectivity to propene over Ga2O3m is probably caused by its uniform mesopore structure with the higher order of pore size distribution."

          [4] "It is most likely that mesoporosity facilitates the dehydrogenation reaction due to the rapid diffusion of the products in the available space of the biggest pores preventing against side reactions, which could decrease the selectivity to propene."

          The literature provides insights into how structural characteristics and surface properties of different Ga2O3 polymorphs influence their catalytic performance in CO2-ODHP reactions:

          1. Acidity, determined by the phase composition of Ga2O3, affects the selectivity to propene. α- and β-Ga2O3 polymorphs show higher selectivity to propene in DHP-CO2 compared to δ- and γ-Ga2O3.

          2. Pore geometry is another important factor, especially for highly porous Ga-containing materials. Uniform mesopore structure with a higher order of pore size distribution may lead to higher selectivity to propene, as observed in the case of Ga2O3m compared to Ga2O3-t with identical phase compositions.

          3. Mesoporosity is suggested to facilitate the dehydrogenation reaction by allowing rapid diffusion of products, which may prevent side reactions and improve selectivity to propene.

          However, the document does not provide specific information on the influence of Lewis acid sites, basicity, or detailed mechanisms to explain the observed activity trends during initial and steady-state stages of the reaction. More research would be needed to fully address these aspects of the question.

          文献为不同Ga2O3多形体的结构特征和表面性质如何影响其在CO2-ODHP反应中的催化性能提供了一些见解：

          1. 由Ga2O3的相组成决定的酸度影响了对丙烯的选择性。α-和β-Ga2O3多形体在DHP-CO2中表现出比δ-和γ-Ga2O3更高的丙烯选择性。

          2. 孔隙几何结构是另一个重要因素，尤其对于高度多孔的含Ga材料。均匀的介孔结构和更高序的孔径分布可能导致更高的丙烯选择性，这在相组成相同的Ga2O3m和Ga2O3-t的比较中观察到。

          3. 据推测，介孔结构通过允许产物快速扩散来促进脱氢反应，这可能会防止副反应并提高丙烯的选择性。

          然而，该文献并未提供关于Lewis酸位点、碱性的影响或详细机制来解释在反应初始和稳态阶段观察到的活性趋势。需要进行更多研究以全面解答这些问题的方面。
