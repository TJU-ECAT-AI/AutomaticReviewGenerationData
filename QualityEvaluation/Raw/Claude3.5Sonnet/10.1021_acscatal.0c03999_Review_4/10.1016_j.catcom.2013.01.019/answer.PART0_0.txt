[1] "Over α- and β-Ga2O3 polymorphs propene was obtained with a higher selectivity in DHP-CO2 than over δ- and γ-Ga2O3 [15]."

[2] "It has been found that in DHP-CO2 process over the Ga-containing materials the selectivity to propene depends on two factors. The first factor is associated with the acidity which is determined either by the phase composition of Ga2O3 or by the properties of the support [13,15,16,19]."

The literature provides limited information on the specific influence of different Ga2O3 polymorphs on CO2-ODHP reactions. However, it does mention that α- and β-Ga2O3 polymorphs exhibit higher selectivity towards propene in DHP-CO2 reactions compared to δ- and γ-Ga2O3. The selectivity to propene in Ga-containing materials is influenced by acidity, which is determined by the phase composition of Ga2O3. 

The document does not provide detailed information on the structural characteristics, surface properties, or Lewis acid sites of different Ga2O3 polymorphs and their specific influence on catalytic performance. It also does not discuss proposed mechanisms to explain activity trends and selectivity during initial and steady-state stages of the reaction.

To fully answer this question, more detailed studies comparing the catalytic performance, structural characteristics, and surface properties of different Ga2O3 polymorphs in CO2-ODHP reactions would be needed.

文献对不同Ga2O3多形体在CO2-ODHP反应中的具体影响提供的信息有限。然而，它确实提到α-和β-Ga2O3多形体在DHP-CO2反应中表现出比δ-和γ-Ga2O3更高的丙烯选择性。在含Ga材料中，丙烯的选择性受酸度的影响，而酸度由Ga2O3的相组成决定。

文档没有提供不同Ga2O3多形体的结构特征、表面性质或Lewis酸位点及其对催化性能的具体影响的详细信息。它也没有讨论解释反应初始和稳态阶段活性趋势和选择性的提议机制。

要全面回答这个问题，需要更详细的研究来比较不同Ga2O3多形体在CO2-ODHP反应中的催化性能、结构特征和表面性质。
