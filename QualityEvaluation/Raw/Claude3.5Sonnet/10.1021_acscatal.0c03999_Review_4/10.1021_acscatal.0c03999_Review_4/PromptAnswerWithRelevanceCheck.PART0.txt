[1] "β- and γ-Ga2O3 outperform the rest in C3H8 conversion and C3H6 selectivity (Table 5). Surface titration experiments reveal that the surface acidity density decreases in the order of β > γ > δ > α, so does the surface basicity."

[2] "Both β- and γ-Ga2O3 contain tetrahedral Ga cations in the structure, on which the Lewis acid sites are coordinatively unsaturated Ga3+ sites. α- and δ-Ga2O3 are constituted by octahedral Ga3+, which are more coordinated with weaker acidity;"

[3] "Nevertheless, the surface base site density shows the correlation with initial activity, demonstrating its promotional effect in the initial period of reaction."

[4] "At the steady state, reaction is proposed to proceed via heterolytic dissociation on Ga oxide without the redox cycle, which is discussed in section 3.2.3."

The structural characteristics, surface properties, and Lewis acid sites of different Ga2O3 polymorphs significantly influence their catalytic performance in CO2-ODHP reactions:

1. Activity trend: β- and γ-Ga2O3 show superior performance in C3H8 conversion and C3H6 selectivity compared to α- and δ-Ga2O3.

2. Surface acidity and basicity: The surface acidity density decreases in the order β > γ > δ > α, with surface basicity following the same trend.

3. Lewis acid sites: β- and γ-Ga2O3 contain tetrahedral Ga cations, which form coordinatively unsaturated Ga3+ sites (Lewis acid sites). α- and δ-Ga2O3 have octahedral Ga3+, resulting in weaker acidity due to higher coordination.

4. Initial activity: The initial activity is dependent on the surface acid density and maximizes on β-Ga2O3. Surface base site density also correlates with initial activity, promoting the reaction in the initial period.

5. Steady-state mechanism: At steady state, the reaction is proposed to proceed via heterolytic dissociation on Ga oxide without a redox cycle.

These observations suggest that the presence of tetrahedral Ga cations and higher surface acidity contribute to improved catalytic performance in CO2-ODHP reactions. The initial stage of the reaction benefits from both acid and base sites, while the steady-state reaction relies on heterolytic dissociation without redox cycling.

不同Ga2O3多形体的结构特征、表面性质和Lewis酸位对CO2-ODHP反应的催化性能有显著影响：

1. 活性趋势：β-和γ-Ga2O3在C3H8转化和C3H6选择性方面表现优于α-和δ-Ga2O3。

2. 表面酸碱性：表面酸性密度按β > γ > δ > α的顺序递减，表面碱性也遵循相同趋势。

3. Lewis酸位：β-和γ-Ga2O3含有四面体Ga阳离子，形成配位不饱和的Ga3+位（Lewis酸位）。α-和δ-Ga2O3具有八面体Ga3+，由于配位数较高，导致酸性较弱。

4. 初始活性：初始活性取决于表面酸密度，在β-Ga2O3上达到最大。表面碱位密度也与初始活性相关，在反应初期起促进作用。

5. 稳态机理：在稳态下，反应被认为是通过Ga氧化物上的异裂解离进行，而不涉及氧化还原循环。

这些观察结果表明，四面体Ga阳离子的存在和较高的表面酸性有助于提高CO2-ODHP反应的催化性能。反应的初始阶段既受益于酸位又受益于碱位，而稳态反应则依赖于不涉及氧化还原循环的异裂解离。

The structural characteristics, surface properties, and Lewis acid sites of different Ga2O3 polymorphs significantly influence their catalytic performance in CO2-ODHP reactions:

1. Activity trend: The catalytic activity of Ga2O3 polymorphs follows the order β > γ > δ > α, which correlates with their surface acidity density.

2. Structural influence: β- and γ-Ga2O3 contain tetrahedral Ga cations, forming coordinatively unsaturated Ga3+ sites that act as strong Lewis acid sites. α- and δ-Ga2O3 have octahedral Ga3+ with weaker acidity, but may undergo reconstruction to form tetrahedral sites.

3. Lewis acidity: The strength and density of Lewis acid sites, particularly tetrahedral Ga3+ sites, play a crucial role in determining the catalytic activity and selectivity.

4. Initial stage mechanism: At the beginning of the reaction, reduction of Ga cations occurs, which benefits the dehydrogenation of propane (DHP).

5. Steady-state mechanism: As the reaction progresses to steady-state, the process is proposed to proceed via heterolytic dissociation on Ga oxide without involving a redox cycle.

These factors collectively contribute to the observed activity trends and selectivity in CO2-ODHP reactions, with β-Ga2O3 showing the highest performance due to its optimal structural and surface properties.

The structural characteristics, surface properties, and Lewis acid sites of different Ga2O3 polymorphs significantly influence their catalytic performance in CO2-ODHP reactions. β- and γ-Ga2O3 show superior performance in C3H8 conversion and C3H6 selectivity compared to α- and δ-Ga2O3. This is primarily due to their surface acidity, which decreases in the order of β > γ > δ > α.

The superior performance of β- and γ-Ga2O3 is attributed to their tetrahedral Ga cations, which form coordinatively unsaturated Ga3+ sites acting as Lewis acid sites. In contrast, α- and δ-Ga2O3 have octahedral Ga3+ with weaker acidity due to higher coordination. However, reconstruction from octahedral to tetrahedral Ga cations may occur, generating surface Lewis acid sites.

During the initial stage of the reaction, the reduction of Ga cations is proposed to benefit the dehydrogenation process. However, at steady-state, the reaction is believed to proceed via heterolytic dissociation on Ga oxide without involving a redox cycle.

The mechanism proposed to explain the observed activity trends and selectivity involves C3H8 heterolytic dissociation. The rate-determining step (RDS) is the slow dissociation of C3H8. The presence of acid sites provides an alternative pathway to promote C3H6 formation by facilitating certain reaction steps and bypassing the RDS. This mechanism explains why catalysts with higher surface acidity, particularly β- and γ-Ga2O3, show better catalytic performance in CO2-ODHP reactions.

不同Ga2O3多晶型的结构特征、表面性质和Lewis酸位显著影响了它们在CO2-ODHP反应中的催化性能。β-和γ-Ga2O3在C3H8转化和C3H6选择性方面表现优异，超过了α-和δ-Ga2O3。这主要是由于它们的表面酸性，酸性强度按β > γ > δ > α的顺序递减。

β-和γ-Ga2O3的优异性能归因于其四面体Ga阳离子，形成配位不饱和的Ga3+位作为Lewis酸位。相比之下，α-和δ-Ga2O3具有八面体Ga3+，由于配位数更高，酸性较弱。然而，八面体到四面体Ga阳离子的重构可能发生，生成表面Lewis酸位。

在反应的初始阶段，Ga阳离子的还原被认为有利于脱氢过程。但在稳态下，反应被认为通过Ga氧化物上的异裂解离进行，而不涉及氧化还原循环。

为解释观察到的活性趋势和选择性，提出了C3H8异裂解离的机理。速率决定步骤（RDS）是C3H8的缓慢解离。酸性位的存在提供了一条替代途径，通过促进某些反应步骤并绕过RDS来促进C3H6的形成。这一机理解释了为什么表面酸性较高的催化剂，特别是β-和γ-Ga2O3，在CO2-ODHP反应中表现出更好的催化性能。

1. Activity trend: The catalytic activity of Ga2O3 polymorphs decreases in the order of β > γ > δ > α, which correlates with their surface acidity density.

2. Structure and Lewis acidity: β- and γ-Ga2O3 contain tetrahedral Ga cations, forming coordinatively unsaturated Ga3+ sites that act as strong Lewis acid sites. α- and δ-Ga2O3 have octahedral Ga3+ with weaker acidity, but may undergo reconstruction to form tetrahedral sites.

3. Initial activity: The initial catalytic activity is primarily dependent on the surface acid density, with β-Ga2O3 showing the highest activity due to its strongest surface acidity.

4. Steady-state mechanism: At steady state, the reaction is proposed to proceed via heterolytic dissociation on Ga oxide without involving a redox cycle.

5. Surface basicity: Although surface basicity follows the same trend as acidity (β > γ > δ > α), it plays a minor role due to insufficient sites for CO2 adsorption and activation.

These findings suggest that the superior performance of β- and γ-Ga2O3 in CO2-ODHP reactions is primarily attributed to their structural features that promote the formation of strong Lewis acid sites, which are crucial for the initial dehydrogenation of propane and the overall catalytic process.

[3] "Combined with the weak reducibility of Ga2O3 (15 mol % of the fresh Ga2O3) and the presence of Ga+ and Ga3+ in catalysts (XPS), one can postulate that the reduction of Ga cations takes place and benefits DHP but only at the initial stage of the reaction. At the steady state, reaction is proposed to proceed via heterolytic dissociation on Ga oxide without the redox cycle"

[4] "The proportion of Ga(IV) sites correlates to weak acid sites, as shown in Figure 9A, implying the essential role of tetrahedral surface Ga3+ sites in creating the surface acidity."

[5] "Since these catalysts show no reduction behavior as evidenced from H2-TPR profiles, the C3H6 formation on Ga2O3 should not proceed through redox mechanisms but rather by following the heterolytic dissociation pathway."
