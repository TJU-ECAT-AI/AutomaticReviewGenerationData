[1] "β- and γ-Ga2O3 outperform the rest in C3H8 conversion and C3H6 selectivity (Table 5). Surface titration experiments reveal that the surface acidity density decreases in the order of β > γ > δ > α, so does the surface basicity."

[2] "The initial activity is dependent on the surface acid density and maximizes on β-Ga2O3. Both β- and γ-Ga2O3 contain tetrahedral Ga cations in the structure, on which the Lewis acid sites are coordinatively unsaturated Ga3+ sites."

[3] "α- and δ-Ga2O3 are constituted by octahedral Ga3+, which are more coordinated with weaker acidity; the reconstruction from octahedral to tetrahedral Ga cations might occur, generating surface Lewis acid sites. Such differences in Lewis acidity explain the activity trend."

[4] "At the steady state, reaction is proposed to proceed via heterolytic dissociation on Ga oxide without the redox cycle, which is discussed in section 3.2.3."

The structural characteristics, surface properties, and Lewis acid sites of different Ga2O3 polymorphs significantly influence their catalytic performance in CO2-ODHP reactions:

1. Activity trend: The catalytic activity of Ga2O3 polymorphs decreases in the order of β > γ > δ > α, which correlates with their surface acidity density.

2. Structure and Lewis acidity: β- and γ-Ga2O3 contain tetrahedral Ga cations, forming coordinatively unsaturated Ga3+ sites that act as strong Lewis acid sites. α- and δ-Ga2O3 have octahedral Ga3+ with weaker acidity, but may undergo reconstruction to form tetrahedral sites.

3. Initial activity: The initial catalytic activity is primarily dependent on the surface acid density, with β-Ga2O3 showing the highest activity due to its strongest surface acidity.

4. Steady-state mechanism: At steady state, the reaction is proposed to proceed via heterolytic dissociation on Ga oxide without involving a redox cycle.

5. Surface basicity: Although surface basicity follows the same trend as acidity (β > γ > δ > α), it plays a minor role due to insufficient sites for CO2 adsorption and activation.

These findings suggest that the superior performance of β- and γ-Ga2O3 in CO2-ODHP reactions is primarily attributed to their structural features that promote the formation of strong Lewis acid sites, which are crucial for the initial dehydrogenation of propane and the overall catalytic process.

不同Ga2O3多晶型的结构特征、表面性质和Lewis酸位对CO2-ODHP反应的催化性能有显著影响：

1. 活性趋势：Ga2O3多晶型的催化活性按β > γ > δ > α的顺序递减，这与它们的表面酸性密度相关。

2. 结构和Lewis酸性：β-和γ-Ga2O3含有四面体配位的Ga阳离子，形成配位不饱和的Ga3+位，作为强Lewis酸位。α-和δ-Ga2O3具有八面体配位的Ga3+，酸性较弱，但可能会重构形成四面体位。

3. 初始活性：初始催化活性主要取决于表面酸密度，β-Ga2O3由于具有最强的表面酸性而表现出最高的活性。

4. 稳态机理：在稳态下，反应被认为是通过Ga氧化物上的异裂解离进行，不涉及氧化还原循环。

5. 表面碱性：虽然表面碱性遵循与酸性相同的趋势（β > γ > δ > α），但由于CO2吸附和活化的位点不足，碱性在反应中起到的作用较小。

这些发现表明，β-和γ-Ga2O3在CO2-ODHP反应中的优异性能主要归因于它们的结构特征，这些特征促进了强Lewis酸位的形成，对丙烷的初始脱氢和整个催化过程至关重要。
