[1] "β- and γ-Ga2O3 outperform the rest in C3H8 conversion and C3H6 selectivity (Table 5). Surface titration experiments reveal that the surface acidity density decreases in the order of β > γ > δ > α, so does the surface basicity."

[2] "Both β- and γ-Ga2O3 contain tetrahedral Ga cations in the structure, on which the Lewis acid sites are coordinatively unsaturated Ga3+ sites. α- and δ-Ga2O3 are constituted by octahedral Ga3+, which are more coordinated with weaker acidity;"

[3] "Nevertheless, the surface base site density shows the correlation with initial activity, demonstrating its promotional effect in the initial period of reaction."

[4] "At the steady state, reaction is proposed to proceed via heterolytic dissociation on Ga oxide without the redox cycle, which is discussed in section 3.2.3."

The structural characteristics, surface properties, and Lewis acid sites of different Ga2O3 polymorphs significantly influence their catalytic performance in CO2-ODHP reactions:

1. Activity trend: β- and γ-Ga2O3 show superior performance in C3H8 conversion and C3H6 selectivity compared to α- and δ-Ga2O3.

2. Surface acidity and basicity: The surface acidity density decreases in the order β > γ > δ > α, with surface basicity following the same trend.

3. Lewis acid sites: β- and γ-Ga2O3 contain tetrahedral Ga cations, which form coordinatively unsaturated Ga3+ sites (Lewis acid sites). α- and δ-Ga2O3 have octahedral Ga3+, resulting in weaker acidity due to higher coordination.

4. Initial activity: The initial activity is dependent on the surface acid density and maximizes on β-Ga2O3. Surface base site density also correlates with initial activity, promoting the reaction in the initial period.

5. Steady-state mechanism: At steady state, the reaction is proposed to proceed via heterolytic dissociation on Ga oxide without a redox cycle.

These observations suggest that the presence of tetrahedral Ga cations and higher surface acidity contribute to improved catalytic performance in CO2-ODHP reactions. The initial stage of the reaction benefits from both acid and base sites, while the steady-state reaction relies on heterolytic dissociation without redox cycling.

不同Ga2O3多形体的结构特征、表面性质和Lewis酸位对CO2-ODHP反应的催化性能有显著影响：

1. 活性趋势：β-和γ-Ga2O3在C3H8转化和C3H6选择性方面表现优于α-和δ-Ga2O3。

2. 表面酸碱性：表面酸性密度按β > γ > δ > α的顺序递减，表面碱性也遵循相同趋势。

3. Lewis酸位：β-和γ-Ga2O3含有四面体Ga阳离子，形成配位不饱和的Ga3+位（Lewis酸位）。α-和δ-Ga2O3具有八面体Ga3+，由于配位数较高，导致酸性较弱。

4. 初始活性：初始活性取决于表面酸密度，在β-Ga2O3上达到最大。表面碱位密度也与初始活性相关，在反应初期起促进作用。

5. 稳态机理：在稳态下，反应被认为是通过Ga氧化物上的异裂解离进行，而不涉及氧化还原循环。

这些观察结果表明，四面体Ga阳离子的存在和较高的表面酸性有助于提高CO2-ODHP反应的催化性能。反应的初始阶段既受益于酸位又受益于碱位，而稳态反应则依赖于不涉及氧化还原循环的异裂解离。
