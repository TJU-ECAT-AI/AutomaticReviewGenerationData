[1] "β- and γ-Ga2O3 outperform the rest in C3H8 conversion and C3H6 selectivity (Table 5). Surface titration experiments reveal that the surface acidity density decreases in the order of β > γ > δ > α, so does the surface basicity."

[2] "Both β- and γ-Ga2O3 contain tetrahedral Ga cations in the structure, on which the Lewis acid sites are coordinatively unsaturated Ga3+ sites. α- and δ-Ga2O3 are constituted by octahedral Ga3+, which are more coordinated with weaker acidity; the reconstruction from octahedral to tetrahedral Ga cations might occur, generating surface Lewis acid sites."

[3] "At the steady state, reaction is proposed to proceed via heterolytic dissociation on Ga oxide without the redox cycle, which is discussed in section 3.2.3."

[4] "The reduction of Ga cations takes place and benefits DHP but only at the initial stage of the reaction."

The structural characteristics, surface properties, and Lewis acid sites of different Ga2O3 polymorphs significantly influence their catalytic performance in CO2-ODHP reactions:

1. Activity trend: The catalytic activity of Ga2O3 polymorphs follows the order β > γ > δ > α, which correlates with their surface acidity density.

2. Structural influence: β- and γ-Ga2O3 contain tetrahedral Ga cations, forming coordinatively unsaturated Ga3+ sites that act as strong Lewis acid sites. α- and δ-Ga2O3 have octahedral Ga3+ with weaker acidity, but may undergo reconstruction to form tetrahedral sites.

3. Lewis acidity: The strength and density of Lewis acid sites, particularly tetrahedral Ga3+ sites, play a crucial role in determining the catalytic activity and selectivity.

4. Initial stage mechanism: At the beginning of the reaction, reduction of Ga cations occurs, which benefits the dehydrogenation of propane (DHP).

5. Steady-state mechanism: As the reaction progresses to steady-state, the process is proposed to proceed via heterolytic dissociation on Ga oxide without involving a redox cycle.

These factors collectively contribute to the observed activity trends and selectivity in CO2-ODHP reactions, with β-Ga2O3 showing the highest performance due to its optimal structural and surface properties.

不同Ga2O3多形体的结构特征、表面性质和Lewis酸位对CO2-ODHP反应的催化性能有显著影响：

1. 活性趋势：Ga2O3多形体的催化活性顺序为β > γ > δ > α，这与它们的表面酸性密度相关。

2. 结构影响：β-和γ-Ga2O3含有四面体配位的Ga阳离子，形成配位不饱和的Ga3+位，作为强Lewis酸位。α-和δ-Ga2O3具有八面体配位的Ga3+，酸性较弱，但可能会重构形成四面体位。

3. Lewis酸性：Lewis酸位的强度和密度，特别是四面体配位的Ga3+位，在决定催化活性和选择性方面起着关键作用。

4. 初始阶段机理：在反应开始时，Ga阳离子发生还原，有利于丙烷脱氢（DHP）。

5. 稳态机理：当反应进入稳态时，过程被认为是通过Ga氧化物上的异裂解离进行，而不涉及氧化还原循环。

这些因素共同造就了CO2-ODHP反应中观察到的活性趋势和选择性，其中β-Ga2O3由于其优化的结构和表面性质而表现出最高的性能。
