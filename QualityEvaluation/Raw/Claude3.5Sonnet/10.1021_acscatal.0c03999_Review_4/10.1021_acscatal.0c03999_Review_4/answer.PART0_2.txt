[1] "β- and γ-Ga2O3 outperform the rest in C3H8 conversion and C3H6 selectivity (Table 5). Surface titration experiments reveal that the surface acidity density decreases in the order of β > γ > δ > α, so does the surface basicity."

[2] "Both β- and γ-Ga2O3 contain tetrahedral Ga cations in the structure, on which the Lewis acid sites are coordinatively unsaturated Ga3+ sites. α- and δ-Ga2O3 are constituted by octahedral Ga3+, which are more coordinated with weaker acidity; the reconstruction from octahedral to tetrahedral Ga cations might occur, generating surface Lewis acid sites."

[3] "At the steady state, reaction is proposed to proceed via heterolytic dissociation on Ga oxide without the redox cycle, which is discussed in section 3.2.3."

[4] "For C3H8 heterolytic dissociation (eqs 3-6 and 3-7 in Figure 10) in DHP, eq 3-6 (Figure 10) proceeds slowly and is, therefore, proposed as the RDS. The presence of acid sites can facilitate eqs 3-10 and 3-11 (Figure 10), providing an alternative to promote C3H6 formation by bypassing eq 3-6 (Figure 10)."

The structural characteristics, surface properties, and Lewis acid sites of different Ga2O3 polymorphs significantly influence their catalytic performance in CO2-ODHP reactions. β- and γ-Ga2O3 show superior performance in C3H8 conversion and C3H6 selectivity compared to α- and δ-Ga2O3. This is primarily due to their surface acidity, which decreases in the order of β > γ > δ > α.

The superior performance of β- and γ-Ga2O3 is attributed to their tetrahedral Ga cations, which form coordinatively unsaturated Ga3+ sites acting as Lewis acid sites. In contrast, α- and δ-Ga2O3 have octahedral Ga3+ with weaker acidity due to higher coordination. However, reconstruction from octahedral to tetrahedral Ga cations may occur, generating surface Lewis acid sites.

During the initial stage of the reaction, the reduction of Ga cations is proposed to benefit the dehydrogenation process. However, at steady-state, the reaction is believed to proceed via heterolytic dissociation on Ga oxide without involving a redox cycle.

The mechanism proposed to explain the observed activity trends and selectivity involves C3H8 heterolytic dissociation. The rate-determining step (RDS) is the slow dissociation of C3H8. The presence of acid sites provides an alternative pathway to promote C3H6 formation by facilitating certain reaction steps and bypassing the RDS. This mechanism explains why catalysts with higher surface acidity, particularly β- and γ-Ga2O3, show better catalytic performance in CO2-ODHP reactions.

不同Ga2O3多晶型的结构特征、表面性质和Lewis酸位显著影响了它们在CO2-ODHP反应中的催化性能。β-和γ-Ga2O3在C3H8转化和C3H6选择性方面表现优异，超过了α-和δ-Ga2O3。这主要是由于它们的表面酸性，酸性强度按β > γ > δ > α的顺序递减。

β-和γ-Ga2O3的优异性能归因于其四面体Ga阳离子，形成配位不饱和的Ga3+位作为Lewis酸位。相比之下，α-和δ-Ga2O3具有八面体Ga3+，由于配位数更高，酸性较弱。然而，八面体到四面体Ga阳离子的重构可能发生，生成表面Lewis酸位。

在反应的初始阶段，Ga阳离子的还原被认为有利于脱氢过程。但在稳态下，反应被认为通过Ga氧化物上的异裂解离进行，而不涉及氧化还原循环。

为解释观察到的活性趋势和选择性，提出了C3H8异裂解离的机理。速率决定步骤（RDS）是C3H8的缓慢解离。酸性位的存在提供了一条替代途径，通过促进某些反应步骤并绕过RDS来促进C3H6的形成。这一机理解释了为什么表面酸性较高的催化剂，特别是β-和γ-Ga2O3，在CO2-ODHP反应中表现出更好的催化性能。
