[1] "β- and γ-Ga2O3 outperform the rest in C3H8 conversion and C3H6 selectivity (Table 5). Surface titration experiments reveal that the surface acidity density decreases in the order of β > γ > δ > α, so does the surface basicity."

[2] "Both β- and γ-Ga2O3 contain tetrahedral Ga cations in the structure, on which the Lewis acid sites are coordinatively unsaturated Ga3+ sites. α- and δ-Ga2O3 are constituted by octahedral Ga3+, which are more coordinated with weaker acidity; the reconstruction from octahedral to tetrahedral Ga cations might occur, generating surface Lewis acid sites."

[3] "Combined with the weak reducibility of Ga2O3 (15 mol % of the fresh Ga2O3) and the presence of Ga+ and Ga3+ in catalysts (XPS), one can postulate that the reduction of Ga cations takes place and benefits DHP but only at the initial stage of the reaction. At the steady state, reaction is proposed to proceed via heterolytic dissociation on Ga oxide without the redox cycle"

[4] "The proportion of Ga(IV) sites correlates to weak acid sites, as shown in Figure 9A, implying the essential role of tetrahedral surface Ga3+ sites in creating the surface acidity."

[5] "Since these catalysts show no reduction behavior as evidenced from H2-TPR profiles, the C3H6 formation on Ga2O3 should not proceed through redox mechanisms but rather by following the heterolytic dissociation pathway."

The structural characteristics, surface properties, and Lewis acid sites of different Ga2O3 polymorphs significantly influence their catalytic performance in CO2-ODHP reactions:

1. Activity trend: β- and γ-Ga2O3 show superior performance in C3H8 conversion and C3H6 selectivity compared to α- and δ-Ga2O3.

2. Surface acidity and basicity: The surface acidity density decreases in the order of β > γ > δ > α, which correlates with the catalytic activity trend. The surface basicity follows the same order.

3. Lewis acid sites: β- and γ-Ga2O3 contain tetrahedral Ga cations, which form coordinatively unsaturated Ga3+ sites acting as Lewis acid sites. α- and δ-Ga2O3 have octahedral Ga3+ with weaker acidity, but reconstruction to tetrahedral sites may occur, generating surface Lewis acid sites.

4. Mechanisms:
   - Initial stage: The reduction of Ga cations (Ga3+ to Ga+) occurs, benefiting the dehydrogenation of propane (DHP).
   - Steady-state: The reaction proceeds via heterolytic dissociation on Ga oxide without a redox cycle.

5. Role of tetrahedral Ga3+ sites: These sites are essential in creating surface acidity, which correlates with catalytic activity.

6. Reaction pathway: C3H6 formation on Ga2O3 follows a heterolytic dissociation pathway rather than redox mechanisms.

The superior performance of β- and γ-Ga2O3 can be attributed to their higher surface acidity density and the presence of tetrahedral Ga3+ sites, which act as Lewis acid sites. These structural characteristics and surface properties facilitate the heterolytic dissociation of propane, leading to improved catalytic activity and selectivity in CO2-ODHP reactions.

不同Ga2O3多形体的结构特征、表面性质和Lewis酸位对CO2-ODHP反应的催化性能有显著影响：

1. 活性趋势：β-和γ-Ga2O3在C3H8转化和C3H6选择性方面表现优于α-和δ-Ga2O3。

2. 表面酸度和碱度：表面酸度密度按β > γ > δ > α的顺序递减，这与催化活性趋势相关。表面碱度遵循相同的顺序。

3. Lewis酸位：β-和γ-Ga2O3含有四面体Ga阳离子，形成配位不饱和的Ga3+位，作为Lewis酸位。α-和δ-Ga2O3具有八面体Ga3+，酸性较弱，但可能发生重构形成四面体位，产生表面Lewis酸位。

4. 机理：
   - 初始阶段：Ga阳离子还原（Ga3+到Ga+）发生，有利于丙烷脱氢（DHP）。
   - 稳态：反应通过Ga氧化物上的异裂解离进行，不涉及氧化还原循环。

5. 四面体Ga3+位的作用：这些位点对创造表面酸性至关重要，与催化活性相关。

6. 反应途径：Ga2O3上的C3H6形成遵循异裂解离途径，而非氧化还原机制。

β-和γ-Ga2O3的优越性能可归因于其较高的表面酸度密度和四面体Ga3+位的存在，这些位点作为Lewis酸位。这些结构特征和表面性质有助于丙烷的异裂解离，从而提高CO2-ODHP反应的催化活性和选择性。
