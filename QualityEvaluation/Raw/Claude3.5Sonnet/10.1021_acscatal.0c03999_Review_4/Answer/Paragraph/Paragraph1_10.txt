The structure-property-performance relationships of Ga2O3 polymorphs in CO2-ODHP catalysis present a fascinating area of study, offering valuable insights into the complex interplay between catalyst structure and catalytic performance. By examining the various polymorphs of Ga2O3, researchers can uncover how subtle differences in crystal structure influence surface properties and, consequently, catalytic activity and selectivity in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) using CO2. This investigation delves into the unique structural characteristics of each polymorph, such as crystal lattice arrangements and surface defects, and their impact on adsorption sites and reaction mechanisms. Understanding these relationships allows for the rational design of more efficient catalysts, potentially leading to improved propylene yields and reduced carbon footprint in industrial processes. Moreover, exploring the interplay between Ga2O3 polymorphs and CO2 activation provides valuable insights into the development of sustainable catalytic systems that can effectively utilize greenhouse gases as oxidants.
