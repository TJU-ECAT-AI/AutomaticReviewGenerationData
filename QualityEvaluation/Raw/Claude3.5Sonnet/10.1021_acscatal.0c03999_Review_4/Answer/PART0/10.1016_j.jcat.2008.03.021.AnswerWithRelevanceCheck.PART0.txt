          [1] "No diffraction lines assigned to other polymorphs of Ga2O3 were observed for all mixed Ga2O3Al2O3 oxide samples, although several phases of gallium oxide (e.g., α-, β-, and δ-Ga2O3) are known to be present depending on the treatment conditions"

[2] "The 71Ga MAS NMR chemical shift is known to reflect the coordination state of the Ga3+ ion in oxide compounds"

[3] "With increasing aluminum content, a progressively increasing intensity of the line due to the tetrahedral Ga3+ ion (180 ppm) was observed for the GaxAl10xO15 samples, as opposed to the trend for the octahedral Ga3+ ion (10 ppm)."

[4] "The weak acid site density for the galliaalumina mixed oxides is an approximately linear function of the tetrahedral Ga3+ population."

[5] "Whereas the variation of surface weak acid site density demonstrated excellent correlation with the corresponding propane conversion rates, a negative correlation was identified between activity and medium-strong acid site density."

[6] "All of the samples exhibited two desorption peaks: a broad peak at 393623 K and a smaller peak at 673800 K, corresponding to acid sites of weak and medium strength, respectively"

[7] "This demonstrates that despite its lower Ga2O3 content, a γ -Ga2O3Al2O3 solid solution with suitable composition can be even more active than bulk γ -Ga2O3."

[8] "This indicates that weak surface acidity (specifically, weak Lewis acid site density of the surface), not medium-strong surface acidity, is crucial to achieving high activity and stability."

          The literature does not provide a comprehensive comparison of different Ga2O3 polymorphs (α-, β-, γ-, and δ-) in CO2-ODHP reactions. However, it offers insights into the structural characteristics, surface properties, and Lewis acid sites of γ-Ga2O3 and Ga2O3-Al2O3 solid solutions that influence their catalytic performance in propane dehydrogenation:

1. Structural characteristics: The study focused primarily on γ-Ga2O3 and its mixed oxides with alumina. No other Ga2O3 polymorphs were observed in the mixed oxide samples.

2. Surface properties: The catalysts exhibited both weak and medium-strength acid sites. The weak acid sites were found to be crucial for high activity and stability.

3. Lewis acid sites: The coordination state of Ga3+ ions, particularly the presence of tetrahedral Ga3+ sites, plays a crucial role in determining surface acidity and catalytic activity. Increasing aluminum content in the mixed oxides led to a higher proportion of tetrahedral Ga3+ ions.

4. Catalytic performance: γ-Ga2O3-Al2O3 solid solutions with suitable compositions showed higher activity than bulk γ-Ga2O3, despite having lower Ga2O3 content. This suggests that the interaction between Ga2O3 and Al2O3 in the solid solution enhances catalytic performance.

5. Activity trends: A positive correlation was observed between weak acid site density and propane conversion rates, while medium-strong acid sites showed a negative correlation with activity. This indicates that weak surface acidity, specifically weak Lewis acid site density, is crucial for achieving high activity and stability.

The study does not provide specific information on the mechanisms of CO2-ODHP reactions or the performance trends during initial and steady-state stages of the reaction for different Ga2O3 polymorphs. To fully answer the question, more research would be needed to compare the structural characteristics, surface properties, and Lewis acid sites of α-, β-, γ-, and δ-Ga2O3 polymorphs and their specific influences on CO2-ODHP reactions.

          该文献并未提供不同Ga2O3多晶型（α-、β-、γ-和δ-）在CO2-ODHP反应中的全面比较。然而，它提供了关于γ-Ga2O3和Ga2O3-Al2O3固溶体的结构特征、表面性质和Lewis酸位如何影响其在丙烷脱氢反应中的催化性能的见解：

1. 结构特征：研究主要集中在γ-Ga2O3及其与氧化铝的混合氧化物上。在混合氧化物样品中没有观察到其他Ga2O3多晶型。

2. 表面性质：催化剂表现出弱酸性和中强酸性位点。弱酸性位点被发现对高活性和稳定性至关重要。

3. Lewis酸位：Ga3+离子的配位状态，特别是四面体Ga3+位的存在，在决定表面酸性和催化活性方面起着至关重要的作用。混合氧化物中铝含量的增加导致四面体Ga3+离子比例的提高。

4. 催化性能：具有适当组成的γ-Ga2O3-Al2O3固溶体表现出比纯γ-Ga2O3更高的活性，尽管其Ga2O3含量较低。这表明Ga2O3和Al2O3在固溶体中的相互作用增强了催化性能。

5. 活性趋势：弱酸位密度与丙烷转化率之间观察到正相关，而中强酸位与活性之间显示负相关。这表明弱表面酸性，特别是弱Lewis酸位密度，对于实现高活性和稳定性至关重要。

该研究未提供关于CO2-ODHP反应机理或不同Ga2O3多晶型在反应初始和稳态阶段的性能趋势的具体信息。要全面回答这个问题，需要进行更多研究来比较α-、β-、γ-和δ-Ga2O3多晶型的结构特征、表面性质和Lewis酸位，以及它们对CO2-ODHP反应的具体影响。
