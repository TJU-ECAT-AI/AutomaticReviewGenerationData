          [1] "For all of the Ga2O3 samples the major phase was confirmed to be -Ga2O3 which is the only stable form of Ga2O3 known."

[2] "Ga2O3-based catalysts have been proved to be active in dehydrogenation or amortisation of light alkanes [10] and in selective catalytic reduction of NOx by hydrocarbons in the presence of oxygen [11]. It is well known that the catalytic activity of gallium oxide catalysts is strongly influenced by their acidity/basicity properties."

[3] "On the other hand, the Lewis acid sites are suspected to be active in ethane dehydrogenation [8]."

[4] "The reaction seems to proceed on acidic sites of the catalyst, since potassium promoted Ga2O3 catalysts do not exhibit high activity."

[5] "Probably, the acidic sites of gallium oxide were the active sites of the dehydrogenation of propane."

[6] "The decrease in the catalytic activity is partly correlated with the decrease in the specific surface area of the catalyst."

[7] "The promoting role of carbon dioxide was only observed in the initial stage of reaction. However, CO2 does not suppress the fast deactivation of the catalyst during the reaction."

          The literature provides limited information on the specific influence of different Ga2O3 polymorphs on CO2-ODHP reactions. However, it offers some insights into the catalytic properties of Ga2O3:

1. β-Ga2O3 is identified as the only stable form of Ga2O3 and was the major phase detected in all samples studied.

2. The catalytic activity of gallium oxide catalysts is strongly influenced by their acidity/basicity properties. Acidic sites on the catalyst surface appear to be crucial for the reaction, particularly for propane and ethane dehydrogenation.

3. Lewis acid sites are believed to play an active role in alkane dehydrogenation reactions, specifically mentioned for ethane dehydrogenation.

4. Surface properties, particularly surface area, influence catalytic performance. A decrease in specific surface area correlates with decreased catalytic activity.

5. The promoting effect of CO2 is only observed in the initial reaction stage, suggesting it may play a role in activating the catalyst surface or removing initial carbon deposits. However, CO2 does not prevent catalyst deactivation over time.

The literature does not provide detailed information on the mechanisms explaining activity trends and selectivity during different stages of the reaction. It also doesn't discuss the structural characteristics and surface properties of different Ga2O3 polymorphs in depth. More comprehensive research would be needed to fully address how these factors influence catalytic performance in CO2-ODHP reactions.

          这篇文献对不同Ga2O3多形体在CO2-ODHP反应中的具体影响提供的信息有限。但它确实提供了一些关于Ga2O3催化性质的见解：

1. β-Ga2O3被确定为Ga2O3唯一稳定的形式，并且是所有研究样品中检测到的主要相。

2. 氧化镓催化剂的催化活性受其酸碱性质的强烈影响。催化剂表面的酸性位点似乎对反应至关重要，特别是对丙烷和乙烷的脱氢反应。

3. 路易斯酸位被认为在烷烃脱氢反应中起着活跃作用，特别提到了乙烷脱氢。

4. 表面性质，特别是比表面积，影响催化性能。比表面积的减少与催化活性的降低相关。

5. CO2的促进作用仅在反应初期观察到，这表明它可能在活化催化剂表面或去除初始碳沉积物方面发挥作用。然而，CO2并不能防止催化剂随时间推移而失活。

该文献没有提供详细解释反应不同阶段活性趋势和选择性的机制信息。它也没有深入讨论不同Ga2O3多形体的结构特征和表面性质。需要进行更全面的研究才能充分了解这些因素如何影响CO2-ODHP反应中的催化性能。
