          [1] "β- and γ-Ga2O3 outperform the rest in C3H8 conversion and C3H6 selectivity (Table 5). Surface titration experiments reveal that the surface acidity density decreases in the order of β > γ > δ > α, so does the surface basicity."

[2] "Both β- and γ-Ga2O3 contain tetrahedral Ga cations in the structure, on which the Lewis acid sites are coordinatively unsaturated Ga3+ sites. α- and δ-Ga2O3 are constituted by octahedral Ga3+, which are more coordinated with weaker acidity; the reconstruction from octahedral to tetrahedral Ga cations might occur, generating surface Lewis acid sites."

[3] "At the steady state, reaction is proposed to proceed via heterolytic dissociation on Ga oxide without the redox cycle, which is discussed in section 3.2.3."

[4] "The initial activity is dependent on the surface acid density and maximizes on β-Ga2O3. Nevertheless, the surface base site density shows the correlation with initial activity, demonstrating its promotional effect in the initial period of reaction."

[5] "Combined with the weak reducibility of Ga2O3 (15 mol % of the fresh Ga2O3) and the presence of Ga+ and Ga3+ in catalysts (XPS), one can postulate that the reduction of Ga cations takes place and benefits DHP but only at the initial stage of the reaction."

[6] "For C3H8 heterolytic dissociation (eqs 3-6 and 3-7 in Figure 10) in DHP, eq 3-6 (Figure 10) proceeds slowly and is, therefore, proposed as the RDS. The presence of acid sites can facilitate eqs 3-10 and 3-11 (Figure 10), providing an alternative to promote C3H6 formation by bypassing eq 3-6 (Figure 10)."

[7] "The proportion of Ga(IV) sites correlates to weak acid sites, as shown in Figure 9A, implying the essential role of tetrahedral surface Ga3+ sites in creating the surface acidity."

          The structural characteristics, surface properties, and Lewis acid sites of different Ga2O3 polymorphs significantly influence their catalytic performance in CO2-ODHP reactions:

1. Activity trend: β- and γ-Ga2O3 outperform α- and δ-Ga2O3 in C3H8 conversion and C3H6 selectivity.

2. Surface acidity and basicity: The surface acidity density decreases in the order of β > γ > δ > α, with surface basicity following the same trend. This correlates with the catalytic activity trend.

3. Lewis acid sites: β- and γ-Ga2O3 contain tetrahedral Ga cations, forming coordinatively unsaturated Ga3+ sites that act as strong Lewis acid sites. α- and δ-Ga2O3 have octahedral Ga3+ with weaker acidity, but may undergo reconstruction to form tetrahedral sites.

4. Initial activity: Dependent on surface acid density, maximizing on β-Ga2O3. Surface base site density also correlates with initial activity, promoting the reaction in the initial period.

5. Mechanisms:
   - Initial stage: Reduction of Ga cations (Ga3+ to Ga+) occurs, benefiting the dehydrogenation of propane (DHP).
   - Steady-state: The reaction proceeds via heterolytic dissociation on Ga oxide without a redox cycle.

6. Role of acid sites: They facilitate certain reaction steps, providing an alternative pathway to promote C3H6 formation by bypassing the rate-determining step in C3H8 heterolytic dissociation.

7. Tetrahedral Ga3+ sites: Essential in creating surface acidity, which correlates with catalytic activity.

The superior performance of β- and γ-Ga2O3 can be attributed to their higher surface acidity density and the presence of tetrahedral Ga3+ sites, which act as Lewis acid sites. These structural characteristics and surface properties facilitate the heterolytic dissociation of propane, leading to improved catalytic activity and selectivity in CO2-ODHP reactions.

          不同Ga2O3多形体的结构特征、表面性质和Lewis酸位对CO2-ODHP反应的催化性能有显著影响：

1. 活性趋势：β-和γ-Ga2O3在C3H8转化和C3H6选择性方面优于α-和δ-Ga2O3。

2. 表面酸碱性：表面酸性密度按β > γ > δ > α的顺序递减，表面碱性也遵循相同趋势。这与催化活性趋势相关。

3. Lewis酸位：β-和γ-Ga2O3含有四面体Ga阳离子，形成配位不饱和的Ga3+位，作为强Lewis酸位。α-和δ-Ga2O3具有八面体Ga3+，酸性较弱，但可能会重构形成四面体位。

4. 初始活性：取决于表面酸密度，在β-Ga2O3上达到最大。表面碱位密度也与初始活性相关，在反应初期起促进作用。

5. 机理：
   - 初始阶段：Ga阳离子还原（Ga3+到Ga+）发生，有利于丙烷脱氢（DHP）。
   - 稳态：反应通过Ga氧化物上的异裂解离进行，不涉及氧化还原循环。

6. 酸位作用：促进某些反应步骤，提供替代途径以促进C3H6形成，绕过C3H8异裂解离中的速率决定步骤。

7. 四面体Ga3+位：对创造表面酸性至关重要，与催化活性相关。

β-和γ-Ga2O3的优越性能可归因于其较高的表面酸度密度和四面体Ga3+位的存在，这些位点作为Lewis酸位。这些结构特征和表面性质有助于丙烷的异裂解离，从而提高CO2-ODHP反应的催化活性和选择性。
