More research is needed to fully understand the behavior of various Ga2O3 polymorphs and their performance over time, including initial and steady-state stages of the reaction.", "Chinese": "Ga2O3多形体的结构特征和表面性质显著影响其在CO2-ODHP反应中的催化性能：\n\n1. 结构：β-Ga2O3具有单斜结构，镓原子均匀分布在四面体和八面体构型中。这种结构导致表面上存在高浓度的弱Lewis酸位点。\n\n2. Lewis酸位点：配位不饱和的四面体Ga3+阳离子作为弱Lewis酸位点，对脱氢活性至关重要。这些位点的浓度越高，催化性能越好。\n\n3. 表面酸度：催化剂表面的酸性基团在反应机理中起重要作用。添加碱性助剂（如钾）会降低催化活性，表明表面酸度的重要性。\n\n4. CO2的影响：\n   a) CO2作为温和的氧化剂改善烯烃产率，将平衡向产物形成方向移动。\n   b) 通过Boudouart反应帮助减少积碳沉积。\n   c) CO2有助于产物脱附，特别是乙烯。\n   d) 然而，CO2也可能在碱性位点上竞争性吸附，潜在地对性能产生负面影响。\n\n5. 反应机理：在Ga2O3 (100)表面上，C-H键活化发生在表面氧从丙烷分子中提取氢原子时，形成与Ga表面位点和羟基配位的丙基物种。\n\n虽然文献提供了关于β-Ga2O3的见解，但缺乏在CO2-ODHP反应中不同Ga2O3多形体（α-、β-、γ-和δ-）之间的全面比较。需要进行更多研究以充分了解各种Ga2O3多形体的行为及其随时间的性能变化，包括反应的初始和稳态阶段。", "Doi": "10.1021/cr5002436"},
