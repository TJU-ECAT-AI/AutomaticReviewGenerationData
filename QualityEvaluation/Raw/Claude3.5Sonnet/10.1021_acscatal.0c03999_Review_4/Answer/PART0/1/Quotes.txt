[1] "β- and γ-Ga2O3 outperform the rest in C3H8 conversion and C3H6 selectivity (Table 5). Surface titration experiments reveal that the surface acidity density decreases in the order of β > γ > δ > α, so does the surface basicity."

[2] "Both β- and γ-Ga2O3 contain tetrahedral Ga cations in the structure, on which the Lewis acid sites are coordinatively unsaturated Ga3+ sites. α- and δ-Ga2O3 are constituted by octahedral Ga3+, which are more coordinated with weaker acidity; the reconstruction from octahedral to tetrahedral Ga cations might occur, generating surface Lewis acid sites."

[3] "At the steady state, reaction is proposed to proceed via heterolytic dissociation on Ga oxide without the redox cycle, which is discussed in section 3.2.3."

[4] "The initial activity is dependent on the surface acid density and maximizes on β-Ga2O3. Nevertheless, the surface base site density shows the correlation with initial activity, demonstrating its promotional effect in the initial period of reaction."

[5] "Combined with the weak reducibility of Ga2O3 (15 mol % of the fresh Ga2O3) and the presence of Ga+ and Ga3+ in catalysts (XPS), one can postulate that the reduction of Ga cations takes place and benefits DHP but only at the initial stage of the reaction."

[6] "For C3H8 heterolytic dissociation (eqs 3-6 and 3-7 in Figure 10) in DHP, eq 3-6 (Figure 10) proceeds slowly and is, therefore, proposed as the RDS. The presence of acid sites can facilitate eqs 3-10 and 3-11 (Figure 10), providing an alternative to promote C3H6 formation by bypassing eq 3-6 (Figure 10)."

[7] "The proportion of Ga(IV) sites correlates to weak acid sites, as shown in Figure 9A, implying the essential role of tetrahedral surface Ga3+ sites in creating the surface acidity."

[1] "It has been found that in DHP-CO2 process over the Ga-containing materials the selectivity to propene depends on two factors. The first factor is associated with the acidity which is determined either by the phase composition of Ga2O3 or by the properties of the support [13,15,16,19]. For example, over α- and β-Ga2O3 polymorphs propene was obtained with a higher selectivity in DHP-CO2 than over δ- and γ-Ga2O3 [15]."

          [2] "The second factor is pore geometry which is important especially in the case of highly porous Ga-containing materials [19]."

          [3] "Since the XRD measurements prove that both Ga2O3m and Ga2O3-t have identical phase compositions (Table 1 and supplement Fig. 3S) we suspect that higher selectivity to propene over Ga2O3m is probably caused by its uniform mesopore structure with the higher order of pore size distribution."

          [4] "It is most likely that mesoporosity facilitates the dehydrogenation reaction due to the rapid diffusion of the products in the available space of the biggest pores preventing against side reactions, which could decrease the selectivity to propene."

"Zheng et al. investigated dehydrogenation of propane to propylene in the presence of CO2 (DHP-CO2) over four polymorphs of gallium oxides. They thought that the superior performance of β-Ga2O3 catalyst was ascribed to an abundance of surface medium-strong Lewis acid sites related to the unsaturated Ga3+ cations and the conjugated effect of proton and oxide."

"Michorczyk et al. prepared ordered mesoporous Ga2O3 and Ga2O3-Al2O3 by nanocasting, which were used as effective catalysts for DHP-CO2. The results revealed that the pure mesoporous gallium and gallium-aluminum oxides (Ga/Al = 4:1) exhibited a promising catalytic performance in the DHP-CO2."

"Many researchers drew their attention to investigating the influence of surface Ga3+ in Ga2O3-containg catalysts on dehydrogenation of propane. And their results suggested that hydrocarbon activation proceeded on low-coordinated Ga3+ cations, accordingly forming propyl-Ga species, and the dehydrogenation products were then generated via subsequent decomposition of the resulting propyl-Ga species."

"Specifically speaking, the low-coordinated Ga3+ sites over gallium oxide were highly effective in the heterolytic dissociative adsorption of propane, because of the very strong polarizability of the CH bonds resulted from perturbation of propane on the low-coordinated Ga3+ sites."

"Chen et al. studied the effect of preparation method and treatment process on the activity and stability of Ga2O3-containg catalysts for the dehydrogenation of propane. The results suggested that larger amount of surface Ga3+ sites with weak Lewis acidity were presented on gallia-alumina solid solution prepared using coprecipitation method than that on the Ga2O3Al2O3 oxide catalysts prepared using physical mixture method, thereby leading to its better performance in propane dehydrogenation with CO2."

"Chen et al. reported that surface acidity (specifically Lewis acid sites density of surface) on the Ga2O3Al2O3 catalysts is crucial to obtain high activity and stability in propane dehydrogenation. Wherein, the surface acidity is attributed to the surface tetrahedral Ga3+ ions."

[1] "The superior performance of the Ga2O3-based system for PDH has been attributed to the unique structural characteristics of coordinatively unsaturated surface (cus) Ga3+ sites [9], which is believed to be crucial for hydrocarbon activation in CO2 atmosphere [10]."

[2] "Over the years, a number of studies have established that the population of the catalytically relevant (cus) Ga species is a strong function of the surface area of Ga2O3 among different Ga2O3 polymorphs [1012]."

[3] "Previous studies on the surface property of β-Ga2O3 have revealed that the Lewis acid centers comprise mainly the structurally defective Ga sites characteristics of (cus) nature [9,22]."

[4] "Therefore, in line with the broad literature documenting the PDH reaction over Ga-based materials, it appears that a high abundance of surface Lewis acid Ga sites is the key factor in achieving high catalytic activity of sucrose-derived Ga2O3 catalysts [11,22]."

[1] "For all of the Ga2O3 samples the major phase was confirmed to be -Ga2O3 which is the only stable form of Ga2O3 known."

[2] "Ga2O3-based catalysts have been proved to be active in dehydrogenation or amortisation of light alkanes [10] and in selective catalytic reduction of NOx by hydrocarbons in the presence of oxygen [11]. It is well known that the catalytic activity of gallium oxide catalysts is strongly influenced by their acidity/basicity properties."

[3] "On the other hand, the Lewis acid sites are suspected to be active in ethane dehydrogenation [8]."

[4] "The reaction seems to proceed on acidic sites of the catalyst, since potassium promoted Ga2O3 catalysts do not exhibit high activity."

[5] "Probably, the acidic sites of gallium oxide were the active sites of the dehydrogenation of propane."

[6] "The decrease in the catalytic activity is partly correlated with the decrease in the specific surface area of the catalyst."

[7] "The promoting role of carbon dioxide was only observed in the initial stage of reaction. However, CO2 does not suppress the fast deactivation of the catalyst during the reaction."

[1] "No diffraction lines assigned to other polymorphs of Ga2O3 were observed for all mixed Ga2O3Al2O3 oxide samples, although several phases of gallium oxide (e.g., α-, β-, and δ-Ga2O3) are known to be present depending on the treatment conditions"

[2] "The 71Ga MAS NMR chemical shift is known to reflect the coordination state of the Ga3+ ion in oxide compounds"

[3] "With increasing aluminum content, a progressively increasing intensity of the line due to the tetrahedral Ga3+ ion (180 ppm) was observed for the GaxAl10xO15 samples, as opposed to the trend for the octahedral Ga3+ ion (10 ppm)."

[4] "The weak acid site density for the galliaalumina mixed oxides is an approximately linear function of the tetrahedral Ga3+ population."

[5] "Whereas the variation of surface weak acid site density demonstrated excellent correlation with the corresponding propane conversion rates, a negative correlation was identified between activity and medium-strong acid site density."

[6] "All of the samples exhibited two desorption peaks: a broad peak at 393623 K and a smaller peak at 673800 K, corresponding to acid sites of weak and medium strength, respectively"

[7] "This demonstrates that despite its lower Ga2O3 content, a γ -Ga2O3Al2O3 solid solution with suitable composition can be even more active than bulk γ -Ga2O3."

[8] "This indicates that weak surface acidity (specifically, weak Lewis acid site density of the surface), not medium-strong surface acidity, is crucial to achieving high activity and stability."

"β-Ga2O3 has a monoclinic structure, in which gallium atoms are equally distributed between tetrahedral and octahedral configurations. This crystal structure has a high concentration of weak Lewis acid sites (coordinatively unsaturated tetrahedral ones on the surface of the material), which are deemed to be centers of dehydrogenation activity."

"Chen et al. reported that a high concentration of Lewis acid groups in the form of coordinatively unsaturated tetrahedral Ga3+ cations is a prerequisite for dehydrogenation activity"

"Michorczyk et al. concluded that acidic groups catalyze the reaction after observing that promotion with a base, such as potassium, resulted in a decrease in activity."

"The addition of CO2 to the reactant feed improves the olefin yield."

"Nakagawa et al. found that the addition of steam and CO2 decreased coke deposition on a Ga2O3/TiO2 catalyst by the Boudouart reaction, while also assisting ethylene desorption."

"CO2 competitively adsorbs on the surface, specifically on the basic sites of the catalyst materials, which can negatively affect their performance."

"Several authors have performed DFT calculations in an effort to understand the dehydrogenation reaction mechanism on Ga2O3. Studies by Liu et al. regarding propane dehydrogenation on a perfect Ga2O3 (100) surface revealed that the CH bond is activated by a surface oxygen that abstracts an hydrogen from the propane molecule, thus forming a propyl species, which coordinates with a Ga surface site and a hydroxyl group."
