Read the questions and answers provided below. First, critically assess the overall relevance of the answers provided to the set of questions asked.

If, upon your assessment, you find that the answers do not contain information that is relevant to the questions asked, stop your review process immediately and respond with a single sentence: "※※※※※※※The provided answers are not relevant to the questions.※※※※※※※". Do not provide any additional explanation or background information, only this sentence should be given as a response in case of irrelevant answers.

If, however, the answers are relevant to the questions asked, proceed to compile answers for each question according to the instructions below. Ensure to aggregate all the relevant answers from the multiple answer results provided in the document, and organize them sequentially by their order number, compiling the corresponding quotes, English answers, and Chinese answers for each question.

If the provided answers' quotes are not differentiated by question, ensure to break them down and assign the quotes to each respective question, outputting them separately within each question's section.

To provide a comprehensive review, differentiate the responses into quotes, English answers, and Chinese answers for each question based on the details given in the 'Answer' XML tags. Structure your review using the XML format showcased below if the answers are relevant to the questions asked:

<questions>

How do the structural characteristics, surface properties (particularly acidity and basicity), and Lewis acid sites of different Ga2O3 polymorphs (α-, β-, γ-, and δ-) influence their catalytic performance in CO2-ODHP reactions, and what mechanisms are proposed to explain the observed activity trends and selectivity during both initial and steady-state stages of the reaction?

<EnglishVersionAnswer>

The given literature does not contain information about the structural characteristics, surface properties, or Lewis acid sites of different Ga2O3 polymorphs and their influence on CO2-ODHP reactions. The document focuses on Ga2O3 supported on HZSM-48 zeolites for propane dehydrogenation, but does not discuss the specific polymorphs of Ga2O3 or their individual catalytic properties. Therefore, this question cannot be answered based solely on the information provided in the given literature.

<ChineseVersionAnswer>

给定的文献中没有关于不同Ga2O3多晶型的结构特征、表面性质或Lewis酸位及其对CO2-ODHP反应影响的信息。该文档主要讨论了负载在HZSM-48沸石上的Ga2O3用于丙烷脱氢反应，但没有涉及Ga2O3的具体多晶型或它们各自的催化性能。因此，仅凭给定文献中提供的信息无法回答这个问题。

The given literature does not contain information specifically addressing the influence of different Ga2O3 polymorphs on CO2-ODHP reactions. The study focuses on Ga2O3 supported on HZSM-48 zeolites for propane dehydrogenation, but does not compare different Ga2O3 crystal structures or discuss their Lewis acidity in detail. The mechanisms and performance trends for α-, β-, γ-, and δ-Ga2O3 polymorphs in CO2-ODHP are not covered in this paper.
