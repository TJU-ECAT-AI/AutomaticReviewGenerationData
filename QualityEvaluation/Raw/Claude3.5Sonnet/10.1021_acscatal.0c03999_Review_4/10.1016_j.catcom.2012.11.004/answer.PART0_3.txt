[1] "The superior performance of the Ga2O3-based system for PDH has been attributed to the unique structural characteristics of coordinatively unsaturated surface (cus) Ga3+ sites [9], which is believed to be crucial for hydrocarbon activation in CO2 atmosphere [10]."

[2] "Over the years, a number of studies have established that the population of the catalytically relevant (cus) Ga species is a strong function of the surface area of Ga2O3 among different Ga2O3 polymorphs [1012]."

[3] "Previous studies on the surface property of β-Ga2O3 have revealed that the Lewis acid centers comprise mainly the structurally defective Ga sites characteristics of (cus) nature [9,22]."

[4] "Therefore, in line with the broad literature documenting the PDH reaction over Ga-based materials, it appears that a high abundance of surface Lewis acid Ga sites is the key factor in achieving high catalytic activity of sucrose-derived Ga2O3 catalysts [11,22]."

The catalytic performance of different Ga2O3 polymorphs in CO2-ODHP reactions is primarily influenced by the abundance of coordinatively unsaturated surface (cus) Ga3+ sites, which act as Lewis acid centers. These sites are crucial for hydrocarbon activation in a CO2 atmosphere. The population of these catalytically relevant (cus) Ga species is strongly correlated with the surface area of Ga2O3, which varies among different polymorphs.

β-Ga2O3, in particular, has been shown to have superior performance due to its unique structural characteristics. The Lewis acid centers in β-Ga2O3 mainly comprise structurally defective Ga sites with (cus) nature. A higher abundance of these surface Lewis acid Ga sites leads to improved catalytic activity.

The mechanism proposed to explain the observed activity trends involves the interaction between the (cus) Ga3+ sites and the hydrocarbons. These sites facilitate the activation of C-H bonds, which is a crucial step in the dehydrogenation process. The presence of CO2 in the reaction atmosphere further enhances this process by acting as a mild oxidant and helping to suppress coke formation.

While the literature does not provide specific information on the initial versus steady-state stages of the reaction or the selectivity trends for different polymorphs, it suggests that catalysts with higher surface areas and more abundant (cus) Ga3+ sites generally exhibit better overall performance in terms of both activity and stability.

不同Ga2O3多形体在CO2-ODHP反应中的催化性能主要受配位不饱和表面(cus) Ga3+位点丰度的影响,这些位点作为Lewis酸中心。这些位点对CO2气氛中的碳氢化合物活化至关重要。这些具有催化相关性的(cus) Ga物种的数量与Ga2O3的表面积强相关,而表面积在不同多形体之间有所不同。

特别是β-Ga2O3由于其独特的结构特征而表现出优异的性能。β-Ga2O3中的Lewis酸中心主要由具有(cus)性质的结构缺陷Ga位点组成。这些表面Lewis酸Ga位点的丰度越高,催化活性就越好。

解释观察到的活性趋势的机理涉及(cus) Ga3+位点与碳氢化合物之间的相互作用。这些位点促进C-H键的活化,这是脱氢过程的关键步骤。反应气氛中CO2的存在通过作为温和的氧化剂并有助于抑制积炭形成,进一步增强了这一过程。

虽然文献没有提供关于反应初始阶段与稳态阶段的具体信息,或不同多形体的选择性趋势,但它表明具有更高表面积和更丰富(cus) Ga3+位点的催化剂通常在活性和稳定性方面表现出更好的整体性能。
