The structural characteristics, surface properties, and Lewis acid sites of different Ga2O3 polymorphs significantly influence their catalytic performance in CO2-ODHP reactions. The superior performance of Ga2O3-based systems is attributed to the unique structural characteristics of coordinatively unsaturated surface (cus) Ga3+ sites, which are crucial for hydrocarbon activation in a CO2 atmosphere.

The population of catalytically relevant (cus) Ga species is strongly dependent on the surface area of Ga2O3 among different polymorphs. Higher surface area generally leads to a greater number of these active sites. The Lewis acid centers in β-Ga2O3 primarily consist of structurally defective Ga sites with (cus) nature.

A high abundance of surface Lewis acid Ga sites is the key factor in achieving high catalytic activity for Ga2O3 catalysts in propane dehydrogenation reactions. This explains why sucrose-derived Ga2O3 catalysts with higher surface areas and more abundant Lewis acid sites show improved catalytic performance.

While the literature does not provide specific information on the mechanisms for all Ga2O3 polymorphs or details on the initial vs. steady-state stages of the reaction, it suggests that the catalytic activity trends are primarily governed by the abundance and accessibility of (cus) Ga3+ sites. These sites likely facilitate the activation of propane and interaction with CO2, leading to improved conversion and selectivity in the CO2-ODHP reaction.

不同Ga2O3多形体的结构特征、表面性质和Lewis酸位显著影响其在CO2-ODHP反应中的催化性能。Ga2O3基系统的优异性能归因于配位不饱和表面(cus) Ga3+位点的独特结构特征，这些位点对CO2气氛中的烃类活化至关重要。

在不同多形体中，具有催化相关性的(cus) Ga物种的数量与Ga2O3的表面积密切相关。通常，更高的表面积会导致更多的这些活性位点。β-Ga2O3中的Lewis酸中心主要由具有(cus)性质的结构缺陷Ga位点组成。

表面Lewis酸Ga位点的高丰度是Ga2O3催化剂在丙烷脱氢反应中获得高催化活性的关键因素。这解释了为什么具有更高表面积和更丰富Lewis酸位点的蔗糖衍生Ga2O3催化剂表现出更好的催化性能。

虽然文献没有提供所有Ga2O3多形体的具体机制信息或反应初始与稳态阶段的详细信息，但它表明催化活性趋势主要由(cus) Ga3+位点的丰度和可及性决定。这些位点可能促进丙烷的活化和与CO2的相互作用，从而提高CO2-ODHP反应的转化率和选择性。

The literature focuses primarily on β-Ga2O3 and does not provide a comprehensive comparison of different Ga2O3 polymorphs in CO2-ODHP reactions. However, some general insights can be drawn:

1. Coordinatively unsaturated surface (cus) Ga3+ sites are crucial for the superior catalytic performance of Ga2O3-based systems in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions with CO2. These sites are believed to be important for hydrocarbon activation in a CO2 atmosphere.

2. The population of catalytically relevant (cus) Ga species is strongly influenced by the surface area of Ga2O3. This relationship holds true across different Ga2O3 polymorphs, suggesting that increasing surface area generally leads to more active sites.

3. In β-Ga2O3, Lewis acid centers primarily consist of structurally defective Ga sites with (cus) characteristics. This indicates that the acidity of the catalyst is closely linked to its surface defects and structural properties.

4. A high abundance of surface Lewis acid Ga sites is key to achieving high catalytic activity in Ga2O3 catalysts. This principle likely applies across different polymorphs, though the study focuses on β-Ga2O3.

The mechanism proposed to explain the observed activity trends involves the interaction between propane and the (cus) Ga3+ sites, facilitated by CO2. The higher density of these sites, achieved through increased surface area and structural defects, leads to improved catalytic performance. However, the study does not provide detailed information on the initial vs. steady-state behavior or on the specific mechanisms for different Ga2O3 polymorphs.

该文献主要集中于β-Ga2O3，没有提供不同Ga2O3多形体在CO2-ODHP反应中的全面比较。然而，可以得出一些一般性的见解：

1. 配位不饱和表面(cus) Ga3+位点对于Ga2O3基系统在CO2存在下的丙烷脱氢(PDH)反应中表现出优越的催化性能至关重要。这些位点被认为对CO2气氛中的烃类活化很重要。

2. 具有催化相关性的(cus) Ga物种的数量强烈受Ga2O3表面积的影响。这种关系在不同的Ga2O3多形体中都成立，表明增加表面积通常会导致更多的活性位点。

3. 在β-Ga2O3中，Lewis酸中心主要由具有(cus)特征的结构缺陷Ga位点组成。这表明催化剂的酸性与其表面缺陷和结构特性密切相关。

4. 表面Lewis酸Ga位点的高丰度是实现Ga2O3催化剂高催化活性的关键。这一原理可能适用于不同的多形体，尽管该研究主要集中在β-Ga2O3上。

解释观察到的活性趋势的proposed机制涉及丙烷与(cus) Ga3+位点之间的相互作用，这种相互作用由CO2促进。通过增加表面积和结构缺陷实现的这些位点的更高密度导致了改善的催化性能。然而，该研究没有提供关于初始vs稳态行为或不同Ga2O3多形体具体机制的详细信息。

The catalytic performance of different Ga2O3 polymorphs in CO2-ODHP reactions is strongly influenced by their structural characteristics and surface properties, particularly the presence of coordinatively unsaturated surface (cus) Ga3+ sites. These sites act as Lewis acid centers and are crucial for hydrocarbon activation in a CO2 atmosphere.

The catalytic performance of different Ga2O3 polymorphs in CO2-ODHP reactions is primarily influenced by the abundance of coordinatively unsaturated surface (cus) Ga3+ sites, which act as Lewis acid centers. These sites are crucial for hydrocarbon activation in a CO2 atmosphere. The population of these catalytically relevant (cus) Ga species is strongly correlated with the surface area of Ga2O3, which varies among different polymorphs.

β-Ga2O3, in particular, has been shown to have superior performance due to its unique structural characteristics. The Lewis acid centers in β-Ga2O3 mainly comprise structurally defective Ga sites with (cus) nature. A higher abundance of these surface Lewis acid Ga sites leads to improved catalytic activity.

The mechanism proposed to explain the observed activity trends involves the interaction between the (cus) Ga3+ sites and the hydrocarbons. These sites facilitate the activation of C-H bonds, which is a crucial step in the dehydrogenation process. The presence of CO2 in the reaction atmosphere further enhances this process by acting as a mild oxidant and helping to suppress coke formation.

While the literature does not provide specific information on the initial versus steady-state stages of the reaction or the selectivity trends for different polymorphs, it suggests that catalysts with higher surface areas and more abundant (cus) Ga3+ sites generally exhibit better overall performance in terms of both activity and stability.

解释观察到的活性趋势的机理涉及(cus) Ga3+位点与碳氢化合物之间的相互作用。这些位点促进C-H键的活化,这是脱氢过程的关键步骤。反应气氛中CO2的存在通过作为温和的氧化剂并有助于抑制积炭形成,进一步增强了这一过程。

虽然文献没有提供关于反应初始阶段与稳态阶段的具体信息,或不同多形体的选择性趋势,但它表明具有更高表面积和更丰富(cus) Ga3+位点的催化剂通常在活性和稳定性方面表现出更好的整体性能。

The catalytic performance of different Ga2O3 polymorphs in CO2-ODHP reactions is strongly influenced by their structural characteristics and surface properties, particularly the presence of coordinatively unsaturated surface (cus) Ga3+ sites. These cus Ga3+ sites act as Lewis acid centers and are crucial for hydrocarbon activation in a CO2 atmosphere.

The population of catalytically relevant cus Ga species is directly related to the surface area of Ga2O3, which varies among different polymorphs. Higher surface area generally leads to a greater number of cus Ga sites, resulting in improved catalytic activity.

The β-Ga2O3 polymorph, especially when prepared using methods that enhance surface area and defect sites (such as sucrose-templating), shows superior catalytic performance. This is attributed to the higher abundance of structurally defective Ga sites with cus nature, which function as Lewis acid centers.

The mechanism proposed to explain the observed activity trends involves the activation of hydrocarbons on these Lewis acid sites. The high abundance of surface Lewis acid Ga sites is considered the key factor in achieving high catalytic activity for propane dehydrogenation.

While the literature does not explicitly discuss the selectivity mechanisms or compare the performance during initial and steady-state stages of the reaction for different polymorphs, it does mention that sucrose-templated β-Ga2O3 samples show slightly higher propylene selectivity compared to conventional β-Ga2O3. This suggests that the increased surface area and abundance of Lewis acid sites may also contribute to improved selectivity.

β-Ga2O3多形体，特别是使用能增强表面积和缺陷位点的方法（如蔗糖模板法）制备的β-Ga2O3，表现出优异的催化性能。这归因于具有cus性质的结构缺陷Ga位点数量更多，这些位点充当Lewis酸中心。

解释观察到的活性趋势的机制涉及碳氢化合物在这些Lewis酸位点上的活化。表面Lewis酸Ga位点的高丰度被认为是实现丙烷脱氢高催化活性的关键因素。

虽然文献没有明确讨论不同多形体在反应初始和稳态阶段的选择性机制或性能比较，但确实提到蔗糖模板法制备的β-Ga2O3样品相比传统β-Ga2O3表现出略高的丙烯选择性。这表明增加的表面积和Lewis酸位点的丰度可能也有助于提高选择性。
