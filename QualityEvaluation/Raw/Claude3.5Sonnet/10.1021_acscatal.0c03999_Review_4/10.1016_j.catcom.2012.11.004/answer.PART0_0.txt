The structural characteristics, surface properties, and Lewis acid sites of different Ga2O3 polymorphs significantly influence their catalytic performance in CO2-ODHP reactions. The superior performance of Ga2O3-based systems is attributed to the unique structural characteristics of coordinatively unsaturated surface (cus) Ga3+ sites, which are crucial for hydrocarbon activation in a CO2 atmosphere.

The population of catalytically relevant (cus) Ga species is strongly dependent on the surface area of Ga2O3 among different polymorphs. Higher surface area generally leads to a greater number of these active sites. The Lewis acid centers in β-Ga2O3 primarily consist of structurally defective Ga sites with (cus) nature.

A high abundance of surface Lewis acid Ga sites is the key factor in achieving high catalytic activity for Ga2O3 catalysts in propane dehydrogenation reactions. This explains why sucrose-derived Ga2O3 catalysts with higher surface areas and more abundant Lewis acid sites show improved catalytic performance.

While the literature does not provide specific information on the mechanisms for all Ga2O3 polymorphs or details on the initial vs. steady-state stages of the reaction, it suggests that the catalytic activity trends are primarily governed by the abundance and accessibility of (cus) Ga3+ sites. These sites likely facilitate the activation of propane and interaction with CO2, leading to improved conversion and selectivity in the CO2-ODHP reaction.

不同Ga2O3多形体的结构特征、表面性质和Lewis酸位显著影响其在CO2-ODHP反应中的催化性能。Ga2O3基系统的优异性能归因于配位不饱和表面(cus) Ga3+位点的独特结构特征，这些位点对CO2气氛中的烃类活化至关重要。

在不同多形体中，具有催化相关性的(cus) Ga物种的数量与Ga2O3的表面积密切相关。通常，更高的表面积会导致更多的这些活性位点。β-Ga2O3中的Lewis酸中心主要由具有(cus)性质的结构缺陷Ga位点组成。

表面Lewis酸Ga位点的高丰度是Ga2O3催化剂在丙烷脱氢反应中获得高催化活性的关键因素。这解释了为什么具有更高表面积和更丰富Lewis酸位点的蔗糖衍生Ga2O3催化剂表现出更好的催化性能。

虽然文献没有提供所有Ga2O3多形体的具体机制信息或反应初始与稳态阶段的详细信息，但它表明催化活性趋势主要由(cus) Ga3+位点的丰度和可及性决定。这些位点可能促进丙烷的活化和与CO2的相互作用，从而提高CO2-ODHP反应的转化率和选择性。
