The literature focuses primarily on β-Ga2O3 and does not provide a comprehensive comparison of different Ga2O3 polymorphs in CO2-ODHP reactions. However, some general insights can be drawn:

1. Coordinatively unsaturated surface (cus) Ga3+ sites are crucial for the superior catalytic performance of Ga2O3-based systems in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions with CO2. These sites are believed to be important for hydrocarbon activation in a CO2 atmosphere.

2. The population of catalytically relevant (cus) Ga species is strongly influenced by the surface area of Ga2O3. This relationship holds true across different Ga2O3 polymorphs, suggesting that increasing surface area generally leads to more active sites.

3. In β-Ga2O3, Lewis acid centers primarily consist of structurally defective Ga sites with (cus) characteristics. This indicates that the acidity of the catalyst is closely linked to its surface defects and structural properties.

4. A high abundance of surface Lewis acid Ga sites is key to achieving high catalytic activity in Ga2O3 catalysts. This principle likely applies across different polymorphs, though the study focuses on β-Ga2O3.

The mechanism proposed to explain the observed activity trends involves the interaction between propane and the (cus) Ga3+ sites, facilitated by CO2. The higher density of these sites, achieved through increased surface area and structural defects, leads to improved catalytic performance. However, the study does not provide detailed information on the initial vs. steady-state behavior or on the specific mechanisms for different Ga2O3 polymorphs.

该文献主要集中于β-Ga2O3，没有提供不同Ga2O3多形体在CO2-ODHP反应中的全面比较。然而，可以得出一些一般性的见解：

1. 配位不饱和表面(cus) Ga3+位点对于Ga2O3基系统在CO2存在下的丙烷脱氢(PDH)反应中表现出优越的催化性能至关重要。这些位点被认为对CO2气氛中的烃类活化很重要。

2. 具有催化相关性的(cus) Ga物种的数量强烈受Ga2O3表面积的影响。这种关系在不同的Ga2O3多形体中都成立，表明增加表面积通常会导致更多的活性位点。

3. 在β-Ga2O3中，Lewis酸中心主要由具有(cus)特征的结构缺陷Ga位点组成。这表明催化剂的酸性与其表面缺陷和结构特性密切相关。

4. 表面Lewis酸Ga位点的高丰度是实现Ga2O3催化剂高催化活性的关键。这一原理可能适用于不同的多形体，尽管该研究主要集中在β-Ga2O3上。

解释观察到的活性趋势的proposed机制涉及丙烷与(cus) Ga3+位点之间的相互作用，这种相互作用由CO2促进。通过增加表面积和结构缺陷实现的这些位点的更高密度导致了改善的催化性能。然而，该研究没有提供关于初始vs稳态行为或不同Ga2O3多形体具体机制的详细信息。
