          [1] "The superior performance of the Ga2O3-based system for PDH has been attributed to the unique structural characteristics of coordinatively unsaturated surface (cus) Ga3+ sites [9], which is believed to be crucial for hydrocarbon activation in CO2 atmosphere [10]."

[2] "Over the years, a number of studies have established that the population of the catalytically relevant (cus) Ga species is a strong function of the surface area of Ga2O3 among different Ga2O3 polymorphs [1012]."

[3] "Previous studies on the surface property of β-Ga2O3 have revealed that the Lewis acid centers comprise mainly the structurally defective Ga sites characteristics of (cus) nature [9,22]."

[4] "Therefore, in line with the broad literature documenting the PDH reaction over Ga-based materials, it appears that a high abundance of surface Lewis acid Ga sites is the key factor in achieving high catalytic activity of sucrose-derived Ga2O3 catalysts [11,22]."

          The catalytic performance of different Ga2O3 polymorphs in CO2-ODHP reactions is strongly influenced by their structural characteristics and surface properties, particularly the presence of coordinatively unsaturated surface (cus) Ga3+ sites. These sites act as Lewis acid centers and are crucial for hydrocarbon activation in a CO2 atmosphere.

The population of catalytically relevant (cus) Ga species is directly related to the surface area of Ga2O3, which varies among different polymorphs. Higher surface area generally leads to a greater abundance of these active sites, resulting in improved catalytic activity.

The β-Ga2O3 polymorph, especially when prepared using methods that enhance surface area and create structural defects, shows superior performance due to a higher density of Lewis acid sites. These sites are primarily composed of structurally defective Ga sites with (cus) characteristics.

While the literature does not provide specific information on the α-, γ-, and δ- polymorphs, it emphasizes that a high abundance of surface Lewis acid Ga sites is the key factor in achieving high catalytic activity for Ga2O3-based catalysts in propane dehydrogenation reactions.

The mechanism proposed to explain the observed activity trends involves the activation of hydrocarbons on these Lewis acid sites, facilitated by the presence of CO2. However, the literature does not provide detailed information on the selectivity during initial and steady-state stages of the reaction or on the specific mechanisms for different polymorphs.

          不同Ga2O3多晶型在CO2-ODHP反应中的催化性能strongly受其结构特征和表面性质的影响，特别是配位不饱和表面(cus) Ga3+位点的存在。这些位点作为Lewis酸中心，对CO2气氛中的碳氢化合物活化至关重要。

具有催化相关性的(cus) Ga物种的数量与Ga2O3的表面积直接相关，而表面积在不同多晶型之间有所不同。较高的表面积通常会导致这些活性位点的丰度增加，从而提高催化活性。

β-Ga2O3多晶型，尤其是使用能够增加表面积和创造结构缺陷的方法制备时，由于Lewis酸位点密度较高而表现出优越的性能。这些位点主要由具有(cus)特征的结构缺陷Ga位点组成。

虽然文献没有提供关于α-、γ-和δ-多晶型的具体信息，但强调表面Lewis酸Ga位点的高丰度是Ga2O3基催化剂在丙烷脱氢反应中实现高催化活性的关键因素。

解释观察到的活性趋势的proposed机制涉及在这些Lewis酸位点上活化碳氢化合物，这一过程由CO2的存在促进。然而，文献并未提供关于反应初始和稳态阶段的选择性或不同多晶型的具体机制的详细信息。
