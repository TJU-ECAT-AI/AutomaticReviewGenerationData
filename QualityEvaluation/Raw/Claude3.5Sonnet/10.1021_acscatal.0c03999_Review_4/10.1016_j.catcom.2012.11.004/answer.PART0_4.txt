[1] "The superior performance of the Ga2O3-based system for PDH has been attributed to the unique structural characteristics of coordinatively unsaturated surface (cus) Ga3+ sites [9], which is believed to be crucial for hydrocarbon activation in CO2 atmosphere [10]."

[2] "Over the years, a number of studies have established that the population of the catalytically relevant (cus) Ga species is a strong function of the surface area of Ga2O3 among different Ga2O3 polymorphs [1012]."

The catalytic performance of different Ga2O3 polymorphs in CO2-ODHP reactions is strongly influenced by their structural characteristics and surface properties, particularly the presence of coordinatively unsaturated surface (cus) Ga3+ sites. These cus Ga3+ sites act as Lewis acid centers and are crucial for hydrocarbon activation in a CO2 atmosphere.

The population of catalytically relevant cus Ga species is directly related to the surface area of Ga2O3, which varies among different polymorphs. Higher surface area generally leads to a greater number of cus Ga sites, resulting in improved catalytic activity.

The β-Ga2O3 polymorph, especially when prepared using methods that enhance surface area and defect sites (such as sucrose-templating), shows superior catalytic performance. This is attributed to the higher abundance of structurally defective Ga sites with cus nature, which function as Lewis acid centers.

The mechanism proposed to explain the observed activity trends involves the activation of hydrocarbons on these Lewis acid sites. The high abundance of surface Lewis acid Ga sites is considered the key factor in achieving high catalytic activity for propane dehydrogenation.

While the literature does not explicitly discuss the selectivity mechanisms or compare the performance during initial and steady-state stages of the reaction for different polymorphs, it does mention that sucrose-templated β-Ga2O3 samples show slightly higher propylene selectivity compared to conventional β-Ga2O3. This suggests that the increased surface area and abundance of Lewis acid sites may also contribute to improved selectivity.

不同Ga2O3多形体在CO2-ODHP反应中的催化性能strongly受其结构特征和表面性质的影响，特别是配位不饱和表面(cus) Ga3+位点的存在。这些cus Ga3+位点充当Lewis酸中心，对CO2气氛中的碳氢化合物活化至关重要。

催化相关的cus Ga物种的数量与Ga2O3的表面积直接相关，而表面积在不同多形体之间有所不同。通常，较高的表面积会导致更多的cus Ga位点，从而提高催化活性。

β-Ga2O3多形体，特别是使用能增强表面积和缺陷位点的方法（如蔗糖模板法）制备的β-Ga2O3，表现出优异的催化性能。这归因于具有cus性质的结构缺陷Ga位点数量更多，这些位点充当Lewis酸中心。

解释观察到的活性趋势的机制涉及碳氢化合物在这些Lewis酸位点上的活化。表面Lewis酸Ga位点的高丰度被认为是实现丙烷脱氢高催化活性的关键因素。

虽然文献没有明确讨论不同多形体在反应初始和稳态阶段的选择性机制或性能比较，但确实提到蔗糖模板法制备的β-Ga2O3样品相比传统β-Ga2O3表现出略高的丙烯选择性。这表明增加的表面积和Lewis酸位点的丰度可能也有助于提高选择性。
