[1] "Zheng et al. investigated dehydrogenation of propane to propylene in the presence of CO2 (DHP-CO2) over four polymorphs of gallium oxides. They thought that the superior performance of β-Ga2O3 catalyst was ascribed to an abundance of surface medium-strong Lewis acid sites related to the unsaturated Ga3+ cations and the conjugated effect of proton and oxide."

[2] "Already published research has shown that hydrocarbon activation proceeded on low-coordinated Ga3+ cations, accordingly forming propyl-Ga species, and the dehydrogenation products were then generated via subsequent decomposition of the resulting propyl-Ga species."

[3] "Specifically speaking, the low-coordinated Ga3+ sites over gallium oxide were highly effective in the heterolytic dissociative adsorption of propane, because of the very strong polarizability of the CH bonds resulted from perturbation of propane on the low-coordinated Ga3+ sites."

[4] "Its obvious that more active catalysts for propane dehydrogenation can be obtained by getting a higher population of low-coordinated surface Ga3+ sites in the Ga2O3-containg catalysts."

[5] "As proposed, propane activation firstly proceeds on these low-coordinated Ga3+ cations, forming propyl-Ga species, and then the dehydrogenation products are generated by subsequent decomposition of the resulting propyl-Ga species."

The structural characteristics and surface properties of different Ga2O3 polymorphs significantly influence their catalytic performance in CO2-ODHP reactions. Among the polymorphs, β-Ga2O3 shows superior performance due to its abundance of surface medium-strong Lewis acid sites related to unsaturated Ga3+ cations. 

The key mechanism proposed to explain the activity trends involves the low-coordinated Ga3+ sites on the catalyst surface. These sites are highly effective in the heterolytic dissociative adsorption of propane due to the strong polarizability of C-H bonds when propane interacts with these sites. The reaction proceeds through the following steps:

1. Propane activation occurs on low-coordinated Ga3+ cations, forming propyl-Ga species.
2. The resulting propyl-Ga species then decompose to generate dehydrogenation products.

The activity and selectivity of the catalysts are directly related to the population of low-coordinated surface Ga3+ sites. Catalysts with a higher number of these sites show improved performance in propane dehydrogenation.

During both initial and steady-state stages of the reaction, the presence of these Lewis acid sites plays a crucial role in maintaining catalyst activity. The conjugated effect of proton and oxide also contributes to the overall performance of the catalyst.

To optimize catalyst performance, efforts should focus on increasing the population of low-coordinated surface Ga3+ sites in Ga2O3-containing catalysts. This can be achieved through various synthesis methods and treatments that promote the formation of these active sites on the catalyst surface.

不同Ga2O3多形体的结构特征和表面性质显著影响其在CO2-ODHP反应中的催化性能。在这些多形体中，β-Ga2O3由于其表面中强Lewis酸位点丰富，这些酸位点与不饱和Ga3+阳离子有关，因此表现出优异的性能。

解释活性趋势的关键机制涉及催化剂表面的低配位Ga3+位点。这些位点在丙烷的异裂解离吸附中非常有效，这是由于丙烷与这些位点相互作用时C-H键的强极化能力。反应通过以下步骤进行：

1. 丙烷在低配位Ga3+阳离子上活化，形成丙基-Ga物种。
2. 随后，生成的丙基-Ga物种分解产生脱氢产物。

催化剂的活性和选择性与表面低配位Ga3+位点的数量直接相关。具有较多这些位点的催化剂在丙烷脱氢反应中表现出更好的性能。

在反应的初始阶段和稳态阶段，这些Lewis酸位点的存在对维持催化剂活性起着至关重要的作用。质子和氧化物的共轭效应也contributes to the overall performance of the catalyst。

为了优化催化剂性能，应该focus on increasing the population of low-coordinated surface Ga3+位点。这可以通过各种合成方法和处理来实现，这些方法和处理可以促进这些活性位点在催化剂表面的形成。
