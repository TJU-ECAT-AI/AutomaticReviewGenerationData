[1] "Zheng et al. investigated dehydrogenation of propane to propylene in the presence of CO2 (DHP-CO2) over four polymorphs of gallium oxides. They thought that the superior performance of β-Ga2O3 catalyst was ascribed to an abundance of surface medium-strong Lewis acid sites related to the unsaturated Ga3+ cations and the conjugated effect of proton and oxide."

[2] "Bingjun Xu et al. found that Ga2O3/TiO2, Ga2O3/Al2O3, and Ga2O3/ZrO2 showed a stronger ability for the dehydrogenation of propane than Ga2O3/SiO2 and Ga2O3/MgO, due to the abundant medium-strong Lewis acid sites on these catalysts surface and special interactions between the support and Ga2O3."

[3] "Chen et al. studied the effect of preparation method and treatment process on the activity and stability of Ga2O3-containg catalysts for the dehydrogenation of propane. The results suggested that larger amount of surface Ga3+ sites with weak Lewis acidity were presented on gallia-alumina solid solution prepared using coprecipitation method than that on the Ga2O3Al2O3 oxide catalysts prepared using physical mixture method, thereby leading to its better performance in propane dehydrogenation with CO2."

[4] "Many researchers drew their attention to investigating the influence of surface Ga3+ in Ga2O3-containg catalysts on dehydrogenation of propane. And their results suggested that hydrocarbon activation proceeded on low-coordinated Ga3+ cations, accordingly forming propyl-Ga species, and the dehydrogenation products were then generated via subsequent decomposition of the resulting propyl-Ga species."

The structural characteristics, surface properties, and Lewis acid sites of different Ga2O3 polymorphs significantly influence their catalytic performance in CO2-ODHP reactions. Among the polymorphs, β-Ga2O3 shows superior performance due to an abundance of surface medium-strong Lewis acid sites related to unsaturated Ga3+ cations. The mechanism proposed to explain the observed activity trends and selectivity involves the following steps:

1. Hydrocarbon activation occurs on low-coordinated Ga3+ cations, forming propyl-Ga species.
2. Dehydrogenation products are generated through subsequent decomposition of the resulting propyl-Ga species.

The presence of medium-strong Lewis acid sites on the catalyst surface is crucial for enhancing catalytic activity. Supported Ga2O3 catalysts (e.g., Ga2O3/TiO2, Ga2O3/Al2O3, and Ga2O3/ZrO2) show stronger ability for propane dehydrogenation compared to Ga2O3/SiO2 and Ga2O3/MgO due to abundant medium-strong Lewis acid sites and special interactions between the support and Ga2O3.

The preparation method and treatment process also affect the activity and stability of Ga2O3-containing catalysts. Coprecipitation methods tend to produce gallia-alumina solid solutions with a larger amount of surface Ga3+ sites with weak Lewis acidity, leading to better performance in propane dehydrogenation with CO2 compared to catalysts prepared using physical mixture methods.

During both initial and steady-state stages of the reaction, the abundance and strength of Lewis acid sites, particularly those associated with low-coordinated Ga3+ cations, play a crucial role in determining catalytic performance. The interaction between the Ga2O3 and the support material also contributes to the overall activity and selectivity of the catalyst system.

不同Ga2O3多形体的结构特征、表面性质和路易斯酸位显著影响了它们在CO2-ODHP反应中的催化性能。在这些多形体中，β-Ga2O3由于表面上与不饱和Ga3+阳离子相关的中强路易斯酸位丰富，表现出优异的性能。提出的解释观察到的活性趋势和选择性的机理包括以下步骤：

1. 烃类活化发生在低配位Ga3+阳离子上，形成丙基-Ga物种。
2. 脱氢产物通过随后分解所形成的丙基-Ga物种而产生。

催化剂表面上中强路易斯酸位的存在对于提高催化活性至关重要。负载型Ga2O3催化剂（如Ga2O3/TiO2、Ga2O3/Al2O3和Ga2O3/ZrO2）由于丰富的中强路易斯酸位和载体与Ga2O3之间的特殊相互作用，表现出比Ga2O3/SiO2和Ga2O3/MgO更强的丙烷脱氢能力。

制备方法和处理过程也会影响Ga2O3含有催化剂的活性和稳定性。共沉淀法倾向于产生具有更多弱路易斯酸性表面Ga3+位点的镓-氧化铝固溶体，与使用物理混合法制备的催化剂相比，在CO2存在下的丙烷脱氢中表现更好。

在反应的初始和稳态阶段，路易斯酸位的丰度和强度，尤其是与低配位Ga3+阳离子相关的路易斯酸位，在决定催化性能方面起着至关重要的作用。Ga2O3与载体材料之间的相互作用也有助于催化剂系统的整体活性和选择性。
