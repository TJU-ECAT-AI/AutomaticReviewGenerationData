[1] "Zheng et al. investigated dehydrogenation of propane to propylene in the presence of CO2 (DHP-CO2) over four polymorphs of gallium oxides. They thought that the superior performance of β-Ga2O3 catalyst was ascribed to an abundance of surface medium-strong Lewis acid sites related to the unsaturated Ga3+ cations and the conjugated effect of proton and oxide."

[2] "Michorczyk et al. prepared ordered mesoporous Ga2O3 and Ga2O3-Al2O3 by nanocasting, which were used as effective catalysts for DHP-CO2. The results revealed that the pure mesoporous gallium and gallium-aluminum oxides (Ga/Al = 4:1) exhibited a promising catalytic performance in the DHP-CO2."

[3] "Chen et al. studied the effect of preparation method and treatment process on the activity and stability of Ga2O3-containg catalysts for the dehydrogenation of propane. The results suggested that larger amount of surface Ga3+ sites with weak Lewis acidity were presented on gallia-alumina solid solution prepared using coprecipitation method than that on the Ga2O3Al2O3 oxide catalysts prepared using physical mixture method, thereby leading to its better performance in propane dehydrogenation with CO2."

[4] "Its apparently plausible that large amount of Lewis acid sites over GA-HS play a key role in improving the catalytic performance for propane dehydrogenation."

[5] "Chen et al. reported that surface acidity (specifically Lewis acid sites density of surface) on the Ga2O3Al2O3 catalysts is crucial to obtain high activity and stability in propane dehydrogenation. Wherein, the surface acidity is attributed to the surface tetrahedral Ga3+ ions."

The structural characteristics, surface properties, and Lewis acid sites of different Ga2O3 polymorphs significantly influence their catalytic performance in CO2-ODHP reactions. Among the different polymorphs, β-Ga2O3 has shown superior performance due to an abundance of surface medium-strong Lewis acid sites related to unsaturated Ga3+ cations. The presence of these Lewis acid sites, particularly surface tetrahedral Ga3+ ions, is crucial for obtaining high activity and stability in propane dehydrogenation.

The mechanism proposed to explain the observed activity trends and selectivity involves the activation of propane on low-coordinated Ga3+ cations, forming propyl-Ga species. These species then decompose to generate the dehydrogenation products. The density of surface Lewis acid sites, which is attributed to the surface tetrahedral Ga3+ ions, plays a key role in improving catalytic performance.

Different preparation methods and treatments affect the distribution and quantity of these active sites. For example, coprecipitation methods have been shown to produce a larger amount of surface Ga3+ sites with weak Lewis acidity compared to physical mixture methods, leading to better performance in propane dehydrogenation with CO2.

During both initial and steady-state stages of the reaction, the presence and stability of these Lewis acid sites continue to influence the catalyst's performance. Mesoporous structures and the incorporation of aluminum (e.g., in Ga2O3-Al2O3 catalysts) have also been shown to contribute to promising catalytic performance in DHP-CO2 reactions.

不同Ga2O3多形体的结构特征、表面性质和Lewis酸位显著影响其在CO2-ODHP反应中的催化性能。在不同的多形体中，β-Ga2O3由于表面中强Lewis酸位的丰富性（与不饱和Ga3+阳离子有关）而表现出优越的性能。这些Lewis酸位的存在，特别是表面四面体Ga3+离子，对于在丙烷脱氢反应中获得高活性和稳定性至关重要。

解释观察到的活性趋势和选择性的机理涉及在低配位Ga3+阳离子上活化丙烷，形成丙基-Ga物种。这些物种随后分解生成脱氢产物。表面Lewis酸位的密度（归因于表面四面体Ga3+离子）在提高催化性能方面起关键作用。

不同的制备方法和处理方式会影响这些活性位点的分布和数量。例如，共沉淀法与物理混合法相比，已被证明能产生更多具有弱Lewis�idity的表面Ga3+位点，从而在CO2存在下的丙烷脱氢反应中表现出更好的性能。

在反应的初始和稳定阶段，这些Lewis酸位的存在和稳定性继续影响催化剂的性能。介孔结构和铝的引入（例如在Ga2O3-Al2O3催化剂中）也被证明有助于在DHP-CO2反应中获得良好的催化性能。
