[1] "Zheng et al. investigated dehydrogenation of propane to propylene in the presence of CO2 (DHP-CO2) over four polymorphs of gallium oxides. They thought that the superior performance of β-Ga2O3 catalyst was ascribed to an abundance of surface medium-strong Lewis acid sites related to the unsaturated Ga3+ cations and the conjugated effect of proton and oxide."

[2] "Michorczyk et al. prepared ordered mesoporous Ga2O3 and Ga2O3-Al2O3 by nanocasting, which were used as effective catalysts for DHP-CO2. The results revealed that the pure mesoporous gallium and gallium-aluminum oxides (Ga/Al = 4:1) exhibited a promising catalytic performance in the DHP-CO2."

[3] "Its apparent that large amount of Lewis acid sites over GA-HS play a key role in improving the catalytic performance for propane dehydrogenation."

[4] "The characterization data suggested that hydrothermal conditions such as generated self-pressure, hydrothermal temperature and time (170 C for 24 h) played significant roles in improving the dispersion and distribution of surface gallium sites. Through the hydrothermal process, more tetrahedral Ga3+ sites gallium sites were exposed on the surface of GA-HS, thus contributing to formation of surface Lewis acid sites."

The structural characteristics and surface properties of different Ga2O3 polymorphs significantly influence their catalytic performance in CO2-ODHP reactions. Among the polymorphs, β-Ga2O3 shows superior performance due to an abundance of surface medium-strong Lewis acid sites related to unsaturated Ga3+ cations. The mesoporous structure of Ga2O3 and Ga2O3-Al2O3 catalysts also contributes to promising catalytic performance.

The mechanism proposed to explain the observed activity trends involves the formation of Lewis acid sites, particularly tetrahedral Ga3+ sites, on the catalyst surface. These sites play a key role in improving catalytic performance for propane dehydrogenation. The dispersion and distribution of surface gallium sites, which can be enhanced through hydrothermal synthesis conditions, contribute to the formation of these active sites.

During the initial and steady-state stages of the reaction, the abundance and strength of Lewis acid sites appear to be the primary factors influencing catalyst activity and selectivity. The hydrothermal synthesis method is particularly effective in creating catalysts with a high number of tetrahedral Ga3+ sites exposed on the surface, leading to improved catalytic performance.

While the literature does not provide specific information on the α-, γ-, and δ-Ga2O3 polymorphs or detailed mechanisms for the initial and steady-state stages of the reaction, it emphasizes the importance of Lewis acidity and the structural characteristics of the catalyst in determining its performance in CO2-ODHP reactions.

不同Ga2O3多形体的结构特征和表面性质显著影响其在CO2-ODHP反应中的催化性能。在这些多形体中，β-Ga2O3由于表面中强Lewis酸位点丰富（与不饱和Ga3+阳离子有关），表现出优越的性能。Ga2O3和Ga2O3-Al2O3催化剂的介孔结构也有助于提高催化性能。

提出的机理解释观察到的活性趋势涉及催化剂表面Lewis酸位点的形成，特别是四面体Ga3+位点。这些位点在提高丙烷脱氢的催化性能中起关键作用。表面镓位点的分散和分布（可通过水热合成条件增强）有助于这些活性位点的形成。

在反应的初始和稳态阶段，Lewis酸位点的丰度和强度似乎是影响催化剂活性和选择性的主要因素。水热合成方法特别有效，可以创建表面暴露大量四面体Ga3+位点的催化剂，从而提高催化性能。

虽然文献没有提供关于α-、γ-和δ-Ga2O3多形体的具体信息，或反应初始和稳态阶段的详细机理，但它强调了Lewis酸性和催化剂的结构特征在决定其CO2-ODHP反应性能中的重要性。

[4] "Many researchers drew their attention to investigating the influence of surface Ga3+ in Ga2O3-containg catalysts on dehydrogenation of propane.

The structural characteristics, surface properties, and Lewis acid sites of different Ga2O3 polymorphs significantly influence their catalytic performance in CO2-ODHP reactions. Among the polymorphs, β-Ga2O3 shows superior performance due to an abundance of surface medium-strong Lewis acid sites related to unsaturated Ga3+ cations. The mechanism proposed to explain the observed activity trends and selectivity involves the following steps:

1. Hydrocarbon activation occurs on low-coordinated Ga3+ cations, forming propyl-Ga species.
2. Dehydrogenation products are generated through subsequent decomposition of the resulting propyl-Ga species.

The presence of medium-strong Lewis acid sites on the catalyst surface is crucial for enhancing catalytic activity. Supported Ga2O3 catalysts (e.g., Ga2O3/TiO2, Ga2O3/Al2O3, and Ga2O3/ZrO2) show stronger ability for propane dehydrogenation compared to Ga2O3/SiO2 and Ga2O3/MgO due to abundant medium-strong Lewis acid sites and special interactions between the support and Ga2O3.

The preparation method and treatment process also affect the activity and stability of Ga2O3-containing catalysts. Coprecipitation methods tend to produce gallia-alumina solid solutions with a larger amount of surface Ga3+ sites with weak Lewis acidity, leading to better performance in propane dehydrogenation with CO2 compared to catalysts prepared using physical mixture methods.

During both initial and steady-state stages of the reaction, the abundance and strength of Lewis acid sites, particularly those associated with low-coordinated Ga3+ cations, play a crucial role in determining catalytic performance. The interaction between the Ga2O3 and the support material also contributes to the overall activity and selectivity of the catalyst system.

不同Ga2O3多形体的结构特征、表面性质和路易斯酸位显著影响了它们在CO2-ODHP反应中的催化性能。在这些多形体中，β-Ga2O3由于表面上与不饱和Ga3+阳离子相关的中强路易斯酸位丰富，表现出优异的性能。提出的解释观察到的活性趋势和选择性的机理包括以下步骤：

1. 烃类活化发生在低配位Ga3+阳离子上，形成丙基-Ga物种。
2. 脱氢产物通过随后分解所形成的丙基-Ga物种而产生。

催化剂表面上中强路易斯酸位的存在对于提高催化活性至关重要。负载型Ga2O3催化剂（如Ga2O3/TiO2、Ga2O3/Al2O3和Ga2O3/ZrO2）由于丰富的中强路易斯酸位和载体与Ga2O3之间的特殊相互作用，表现出比Ga2O3/SiO2和Ga2O3/MgO更强的丙烷脱氢能力。

制备方法和处理过程也会影响Ga2O3含有催化剂的活性和稳定性。共沉淀法倾向于产生具有更多弱路易斯酸性表面Ga3+位点的镓-氧化铝固溶体，与使用物理混合法制备的催化剂相比，在CO2存在下的丙烷脱氢中表现更好。

在反应的初始和稳态阶段，路易斯酸位的丰度和强度，尤其是与低配位Ga3+阳离子相关的路易斯酸位，在决定催化性能方面起着至关重要的作用。Ga2O3与载体材料之间的相互作用也有助于催化剂系统的整体活性和选择性。

The structural characteristics, surface properties, and Lewis acid sites of different Ga2O3 polymorphs significantly influence their catalytic performance in CO2-ODHP reactions. Among the polymorphs, β-Ga2O3 shows superior performance due to its abundance of surface medium-strong Lewis acid sites related to unsaturated Ga3+ cations. The catalytic activity is closely linked to the population of low-coordinated surface Ga3+ sites.

The proposed mechanism for the reaction involves hydrocarbon activation on low-coordinated Ga3+ cations, forming propyl-Ga species. These species then decompose to generate the dehydrogenation products. This mechanism explains the observed activity trends, as catalysts with a higher number of low-coordinated Ga3+ sites show improved performance.

The mesoporous structure of Ga2O3 and Ga2O3-Al2O3 catalysts also contributes to their promising catalytic performance in DHP-CO2 reactions. This suggests that both the chemical nature (Lewis acidity) and physical structure (mesoporosity) play important roles in determining catalyst efficiency.

While the literature doesn't explicitly discuss the initial vs. steady-state stages of the reaction or the selectivity trends for different polymorphs, it's clear that the abundance and accessibility of low-coordinated Ga3+ sites are crucial factors throughout the reaction process.

反应的提议机制涉及在低配位Ga3+阳离子上活化烃类，形成丙基-Ga物种。这些物种随后分解生成脱氢产物。这一机制解释了观察到的活性趋势，因为具有更多低配位Ga3+位点的催化剂表现出更好的性能。

Ga2O3和Ga2O3-Al2O3催化剂的介孔结构也有助于其在DHP-CO2反应中表现出良好的催化性能。这表明化学性质（Lewis酸性）和物理结构（介孔性）在决定催化剂效率方面都起着重要作用。

虽然文献没有明确讨论反应的初始阶段与稳态阶段，或不同多形体的选择性趋势，但很明显，低配位Ga3+位点的丰度和可及性是整个反应过程中的关键因素。

The structural characteristics and surface properties of different Ga2O3 polymorphs significantly influence their catalytic performance in CO2-ODHP reactions. Among the polymorphs, β-Ga2O3 shows superior performance due to its abundance of surface medium-strong Lewis acid sites related to unsaturated Ga3+ cations. 

The key mechanism proposed to explain the activity trends involves the low-coordinated Ga3+ sites on the catalyst surface. These sites are highly effective in the heterolytic dissociative adsorption of propane due to the strong polarizability of C-H bonds when propane interacts with these sites. The reaction proceeds through the following steps:

1. Propane activation occurs on low-coordinated Ga3+ cations, forming propyl-Ga species.
2. The resulting propyl-Ga species then decompose to generate dehydrogenation products.

The activity and selectivity of the catalysts are directly related to the population of low-coordinated surface Ga3+ sites. Catalysts with a higher number of these sites show improved performance in propane dehydrogenation.

During both initial and steady-state stages of the reaction, the presence of these Lewis acid sites plays a crucial role in maintaining catalyst activity. The conjugated effect of proton and oxide also contributes to the overall performance of the catalyst.

To optimize catalyst performance, efforts should focus on increasing the population of low-coordinated surface Ga3+ sites in Ga2O3-containing catalysts. This can be achieved through various synthesis methods and treatments that promote the formation of these active sites on the catalyst surface.

解释活性趋势的关键机制涉及催化剂表面的低配位Ga3+位点。这些位点在丙烷的异裂解离吸附中非常有效，这是由于丙烷与这些位点相互作用时C-H键的强极化能力。反应通过以下步骤进行：

1. 丙烷在低配位Ga3+阳离子上活化，形成丙基-Ga物种。
2. 随后，生成的丙基-Ga物种分解产生脱氢产物。

催化剂的活性和选择性与表面低配位Ga3+位点的数量直接相关。具有较多这些位点的催化剂在丙烷脱氢反应中表现出更好的性能。

在反应的初始阶段和稳态阶段，这些Lewis酸位点的存在对维持催化剂活性起着至关重要的作用。质子和氧化物的共轭效应也contributes to the overall performance of the catalyst。

为了优化催化剂性能，应该focus on increasing the population of low-coordinated surface Ga3+位点。这可以通过各种合成方法和处理来实现，这些方法和处理可以促进这些活性位点在催化剂表面的形成。

The structural characteristics, surface properties, and Lewis acid sites of different Ga2O3 polymorphs significantly influence their catalytic performance in CO2-ODHP reactions. Among the different polymorphs, β-Ga2O3 has shown superior performance due to an abundance of surface medium-strong Lewis acid sites related to unsaturated Ga3+ cations. The presence of these Lewis acid sites, particularly surface tetrahedral Ga3+ ions, is crucial for obtaining high activity and stability in propane dehydrogenation.

The mechanism proposed to explain the observed activity trends and selectivity involves the activation of propane on low-coordinated Ga3+ cations, forming propyl-Ga species. These species then decompose to generate the dehydrogenation products. The density of surface Lewis acid sites, which is attributed to the surface tetrahedral Ga3+ ions, plays a key role in improving catalytic performance.

Different preparation methods and treatments affect the distribution and quantity of these active sites. For example, coprecipitation methods have been shown to produce a larger amount of surface Ga3+ sites with weak Lewis acidity compared to physical mixture methods, leading to better performance in propane dehydrogenation with CO2.

During both initial and steady-state stages of the reaction, the presence and stability of these Lewis acid sites continue to influence the catalyst's performance. Mesoporous structures and the incorporation of aluminum (e.g., in Ga2O3-Al2O3 catalysts) have also been shown to contribute to promising catalytic performance in DHP-CO2 reactions.
