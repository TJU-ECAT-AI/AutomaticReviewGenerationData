[1] "Zheng et al. investigated dehydrogenation of propane to propylene in the presence of CO2 (DHP-CO2) over four polymorphs of gallium oxides. They thought that the superior performance of β-Ga2O3 catalyst was ascribed to an abundance of surface medium-strong Lewis acid sites related to the unsaturated Ga3+ cations and the conjugated effect of proton and oxide."

[2] "Michorczyk et al. prepared ordered mesoporous Ga2O3 and Ga2O3-Al2O3 by nanocasting, which were used as effective catalysts for DHP-CO2. The results revealed that the pure mesoporous gallium and gallium-aluminum oxides (Ga/Al = 4:1) exhibited a promising catalytic performance in the DHP-CO2."

[3] "Many researchers drew their attention to investigating the influence of surface Ga3+ in Ga2O3-containg catalysts on dehydrogenation of propane. And their results suggested that hydrocarbon activation proceeded on low-coordinated Ga3+ cations, accordingly forming propyl-Ga species, and the dehydrogenation products were then generated via subsequent decomposition of the resulting propyl-Ga species."

[4] "Its obvious that more active catalysts for propane dehydrogenation can be obtained by getting a higher population of low-coordinated surface Ga3+ sites in the Ga2O3-containg catalysts."

The structural characteristics, surface properties, and Lewis acid sites of different Ga2O3 polymorphs significantly influence their catalytic performance in CO2-ODHP reactions. Among the polymorphs, β-Ga2O3 shows superior performance due to its abundance of surface medium-strong Lewis acid sites related to unsaturated Ga3+ cations. The catalytic activity is closely linked to the population of low-coordinated surface Ga3+ sites.

The proposed mechanism for the reaction involves hydrocarbon activation on low-coordinated Ga3+ cations, forming propyl-Ga species. These species then decompose to generate the dehydrogenation products. This mechanism explains the observed activity trends, as catalysts with a higher number of low-coordinated Ga3+ sites show improved performance.

The mesoporous structure of Ga2O3 and Ga2O3-Al2O3 catalysts also contributes to their promising catalytic performance in DHP-CO2 reactions. This suggests that both the chemical nature (Lewis acidity) and physical structure (mesoporosity) play important roles in determining catalyst efficiency.

While the literature doesn't explicitly discuss the initial vs. steady-state stages of the reaction or the selectivity trends for different polymorphs, it's clear that the abundance and accessibility of low-coordinated Ga3+ sites are crucial factors throughout the reaction process.

不同Ga2O3多形体的结构特征、表面性质和Lewis酸位显著影响其在CO2-ODHP反应中的催化性能。在多形体中，β-Ga2O3由于其表面中强Lewis酸位与不饱和Ga3+阳离子相关的丰富性而表现出优异的性能。催化活性与低配位表面Ga3+位点的数量密切相关。

反应的提议机制涉及在低配位Ga3+阳离子上活化烃类，形成丙基-Ga物种。这些物种随后分解生成脱氢产物。这一机制解释了观察到的活性趋势，因为具有更多低配位Ga3+位点的催化剂表现出更好的性能。

Ga2O3和Ga2O3-Al2O3催化剂的介孔结构也有助于其在DHP-CO2反应中表现出良好的催化性能。这表明化学性质（Lewis酸性）和物理结构（介孔性）在决定催化剂效率方面都起着重要作用。

虽然文献没有明确讨论反应的初始阶段与稳态阶段，或不同多形体的选择性趋势，但很明显，低配位Ga3+位点的丰度和可及性是整个反应过程中的关键因素。
