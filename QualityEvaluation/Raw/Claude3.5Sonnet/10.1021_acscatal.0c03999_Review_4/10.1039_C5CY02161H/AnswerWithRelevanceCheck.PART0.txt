          "Zheng et al. investigated dehydrogenation of propane to propylene in the presence of CO2 (DHP-CO2) over four polymorphs of gallium oxides. They thought that the superior performance of β-Ga2O3 catalyst was ascribed to an abundance of surface medium-strong Lewis acid sites related to the unsaturated Ga3+ cations and the conjugated effect of proton and oxide."

"Michorczyk et al. prepared ordered mesoporous Ga2O3 and Ga2O3-Al2O3 by nanocasting, which were used as effective catalysts for DHP-CO2. The results revealed that the pure mesoporous gallium and gallium-aluminum oxides (Ga/Al = 4:1) exhibited a promising catalytic performance in the DHP-CO2."

"Many researchers drew their attention to investigating the influence of surface Ga3+ in Ga2O3-containg catalysts on dehydrogenation of propane. And their results suggested that hydrocarbon activation proceeded on low-coordinated Ga3+ cations, accordingly forming propyl-Ga species, and the dehydrogenation products were then generated via subsequent decomposition of the resulting propyl-Ga species."

"Specifically speaking, the low-coordinated Ga3+ sites over gallium oxide were highly effective in the heterolytic dissociative adsorption of propane, because of the very strong polarizability of the CH bonds resulted from perturbation of propane on the low-coordinated Ga3+ sites."

"Chen et al. studied the effect of preparation method and treatment process on the activity and stability of Ga2O3-containg catalysts for the dehydrogenation of propane. The results suggested that larger amount of surface Ga3+ sites with weak Lewis acidity were presented on gallia-alumina solid solution prepared using coprecipitation method than that on the Ga2O3Al2O3 oxide catalysts prepared using physical mixture method, thereby leading to its better performance in propane dehydrogenation with CO2."

"Chen et al. reported that surface acidity (specifically Lewis acid sites density of surface) on the Ga2O3Al2O3 catalysts is crucial to obtain high activity and stability in propane dehydrogenation. Wherein, the surface acidity is attributed to the surface tetrahedral Ga3+ ions."

          The structural characteristics, surface properties, and Lewis acid sites of different Ga2O3 polymorphs significantly influence their catalytic performance in CO2-ODHP reactions. Among the polymorphs, β-Ga2O3 shows superior performance due to an abundance of surface medium-strong Lewis acid sites related to unsaturated Ga3+ cations. The mesoporous structure of Ga2O3 and Ga2O3-Al2O3 catalysts also contributes to promising catalytic performance.

The mechanism proposed to explain the observed activity trends and selectivity involves the following steps:
1. Hydrocarbon activation occurs on low-coordinated Ga3+ cations, forming propyl-Ga species.
2. Dehydrogenation products are generated through subsequent decomposition of the resulting propyl-Ga species.

The low-coordinated Ga3+ sites are highly effective in the heterolytic dissociative adsorption of propane due to the strong polarizability of C-H bonds when propane interacts with these sites.

The preparation method and treatment process affect the activity and stability of Ga2O3-containing catalysts. Coprecipitation methods tend to produce gallia-alumina solid solutions with a larger amount of surface Ga3+ sites with weak Lewis acidity, leading to better performance in propane dehydrogenation with CO2 compared to catalysts prepared using physical mixture methods.

During both initial and steady-state stages of the reaction, the abundance and strength of Lewis acid sites, particularly those associated with surface tetrahedral Ga3+ ions, play a crucial role in determining catalytic performance and stability. The interaction between the Ga2O3 and the support material (e.g., Al2O3) also contributes to the overall activity and selectivity of the catalyst system.

          不同Ga2O3多形体的结构特征、表面性质和Lewis酸位显著影响其在CO2-ODHP反应中的催化性能。在这些多形体中，β-Ga2O3由于表面中强Lewis酸位点丰富（与不饱和Ga3+阳离子有关），表现出优越的性能。Ga2O3和Ga2O3-Al2O3催化剂的介孔结构也有助于提高催化性能。

提出的解释观察到的活性趋势和选择性的机理包括以下步骤：
1. 烃类活化发生在低配位Ga3+阳离子上，形成丙基-Ga物种。
2. 脱氢产物通过随后分解所形成的丙基-Ga物种而产生。

低配位Ga3+位点在丙烷的异裂解离吸附中非常有效，这是由于丙烷与这些位点相互作用时C-H键的强极化能力。

制备方法和处理过程影响Ga2O3含有催化剂的活性和稳定性。共沉淀法倾向于产生具有更多弱Lewis酸性表面Ga3+位点的镓-氧化铝固溶体，与使用物理混合法制备的催化剂相比，在CO2存在下的丙烷脱氢中表现更好。

在反应的初始和稳态阶段，Lewis酸位的丰度和强度，尤其是与表面四面体Ga3+离子相关的Lewis酸位，在决定催化性能和稳定性方面起着至关重要的作用。Ga2O3与载体材料（如Al2O3）之间的相互作用也有助于催化剂系统的整体活性和选择性。
