[1] "Zheng et al. investigated dehydrogenation of propane to propylene in the presence of CO2 (DHP-CO2) over four polymorphs of gallium oxides. They thought that the superior performance of β-Ga2O3 catalyst was ascribed to an abundance of surface medium-strong Lewis acid sites related to the unsaturated Ga3+ cations and the conjugated effect of proton and oxide."

[2] "Michorczyk et al. prepared ordered mesoporous Ga2O3 and Ga2O3-Al2O3 by nanocasting, which were used as effective catalysts for DHP-CO2. The results revealed that the pure mesoporous gallium and gallium-aluminum oxides (Ga/Al = 4:1) exhibited a promising catalytic performance in the DHP-CO2."

[3] "Its apparent that large amount of Lewis acid sites over GA-HS play a key role in improving the catalytic performance for propane dehydrogenation."

[4] "The characterization data suggested that hydrothermal conditions such as generated self-pressure, hydrothermal temperature and time (170 C for 24 h) played significant roles in improving the dispersion and distribution of surface gallium sites. Through the hydrothermal process, more tetrahedral Ga3+ sites gallium sites were exposed on the surface of GA-HS, thus contributing to formation of surface Lewis acid sites."

The structural characteristics and surface properties of different Ga2O3 polymorphs significantly influence their catalytic performance in CO2-ODHP reactions. Among the polymorphs, β-Ga2O3 shows superior performance due to an abundance of surface medium-strong Lewis acid sites related to unsaturated Ga3+ cations. The mesoporous structure of Ga2O3 and Ga2O3-Al2O3 catalysts also contributes to promising catalytic performance.

The mechanism proposed to explain the observed activity trends involves the formation of Lewis acid sites, particularly tetrahedral Ga3+ sites, on the catalyst surface. These sites play a key role in improving catalytic performance for propane dehydrogenation. The dispersion and distribution of surface gallium sites, which can be enhanced through hydrothermal synthesis conditions, contribute to the formation of these active sites.

During the initial and steady-state stages of the reaction, the abundance and strength of Lewis acid sites appear to be the primary factors influencing catalyst activity and selectivity. The hydrothermal synthesis method is particularly effective in creating catalysts with a high number of tetrahedral Ga3+ sites exposed on the surface, leading to improved catalytic performance.

While the literature does not provide specific information on the α-, γ-, and δ-Ga2O3 polymorphs or detailed mechanisms for the initial and steady-state stages of the reaction, it emphasizes the importance of Lewis acidity and the structural characteristics of the catalyst in determining its performance in CO2-ODHP reactions.

不同Ga2O3多形体的结构特征和表面性质显著影响其在CO2-ODHP反应中的催化性能。在这些多形体中，β-Ga2O3由于表面中强Lewis酸位点丰富（与不饱和Ga3+阳离子有关），表现出优越的性能。Ga2O3和Ga2O3-Al2O3催化剂的介孔结构也有助于提高催化性能。

提出的机理解释观察到的活性趋势涉及催化剂表面Lewis酸位点的形成，特别是四面体Ga3+位点。这些位点在提高丙烷脱氢的催化性能中起关键作用。表面镓位点的分散和分布（可通过水热合成条件增强）有助于这些活性位点的形成。

在反应的初始和稳态阶段，Lewis酸位点的丰度和强度似乎是影响催化剂活性和选择性的主要因素。水热合成方法特别有效，可以创建表面暴露大量四面体Ga3+位点的催化剂，从而提高催化性能。

虽然文献没有提供关于α-、γ-和δ-Ga2O3多形体的具体信息，或反应初始和稳态阶段的详细机理，但它强调了Lewis酸性和催化剂的结构特征在决定其CO2-ODHP反应性能中的重要性。
