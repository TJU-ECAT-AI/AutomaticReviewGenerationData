[1] "Ga2O3ZrO2 catalysts exhibit different catalytic behavior for the two dehydrogenation reactions."

[2] "The nature of acid sites present on the 15GZ catalyst as a representative was measured in situ by FTIR spectra of pyridine adsorption (not shown). It can be seen that Lewis (characteristic at 1445, 1490 and 1606 cm1) acid sites are present on the catalyst."

[3] "As the Ga2O3 content is increased, the number of total base sites present on GZ catalysts first increases and then decreases. A maximum value appears at a Ga2O3 content of 15%."

[4] "According to this reaction mechanism, both acid and base sites are necessary for the reaction. The medium to strong acid sites would enhance the adsorption and activation of EB molecules, and the availability of adjacent basic OH groups on the catalyst would promote the abstraction of a-hydrogen from EB molecules to form water."

[5] "After the incorporation of gallium oxide into ZrO2, the catalyst becomes much more active, suggesting that Ga2O3 is the major active component for propane dehydrogenation in the presence of CO2."

The literature does not provide detailed information about different Ga2O3 polymorphs and their specific influences on CO2-ODHP reactions. However, it does discuss some general trends for Ga2O3-ZrO2 catalysts:

1. The catalysts exhibit different behaviors for ethylbenzene and propane dehydrogenation reactions.

2. Lewis acid sites are present on the catalysts.

3. The number of base sites first increases then decreases with increasing Ga2O3 content, reaching a maximum at 15% Ga2O3.

4. Both acid and base sites are necessary for the ethylbenzene dehydrogenation reaction. Medium to strong acid sites enhance adsorption and activation of ethylbenzene, while basic OH groups promote hydrogen abstraction.

5. Ga2O3 is identified as the major active component for propane dehydrogenation in the presence of CO2.

The study does not provide information on reaction mechanisms during initial and steady-state stages or discuss different Ga2O3 polymorphs. More specific research would be needed to address these aspects of the question.

该文献并未提供有关不同Ga2O3多晶型及其对CO2-ODHP反应的具体影响的详细信息。但是，它确实讨论了Ga2O3-ZrO2催化剂的一些一般趋势：

1. 这些催化剂在乙苯和丙烷脱氢反应中表现出不同的行为。

2. 催化剂上存在Lewis酸位。

3. 随着Ga2O3含量的增加，碱性位点的数量先增加后减少，在15%Ga2O3含量时达到最大值。

4. 乙苯脱氢反应需要酸性和碱性位点。中强酸性位点增强乙苯的吸附和活化，而碱性OH基则促进氢的脱除。

5. Ga2O3被确定为CO2存在下丙烷脱氢的主要活性组分。

该研究没有提供反应初始和稳态阶段的反应机理信息，也没有讨论不同的Ga2O3多晶型。要解答这些问题的方面，需要进行更具体的研究。
