    "QuestionEnglish": "How do the structural characteristics, surface properties (particularly acidity and basicity), and Lewis acid sites of different Ga2O3 polymorphs (α-, β-, γ-, and δ-) influence their catalytic performance in CO2-ODHP reactions, and what mechanisms are proposed to explain the observed activity trends and selectivity during both initial and steady-state stages of the reaction?",
    "QuestionChinese": "不同Ga2O3多形体（α-、β-、γ-和δ-）的结构特征、表面性质（特别是酸度和碱度）以及Lewis酸位点如何影响它们在CO2-ODHP反应中的催化性能，并且提出了哪些机制来解释在反应的初始和稳态阶段观察到的活性趋势和选择性？"
