[1] "For all of the Ga2O3 samples the major phase was confirmed to be -Ga2O3 which is the only stable form of Ga2O3 known."

[2] "Probably, the acidic sites of gallium oxide were the active sites of the dehydrogenation of propane."

[3] "The decrease in the catalytic activity is partly correlated with the decrease in the specific surface area of the catalyst."

The literature does not provide comprehensive information about different Ga2O3 polymorphs and their influence on CO2-ODHP reactions. It only mentions β-Ga2O3 as the major and only stable form. The document suggests that acidic sites on gallium oxide are likely the active sites for propane dehydrogenation. The catalytic activity is partly correlated with the specific surface area of the catalyst. However, the paper does not discuss detailed mechanisms or compare different Ga2O3 polymorphs. More research would be needed to fully answer the question about how structural characteristics, surface properties, and Lewis acid sites of various Ga2O3 polymorphs affect their catalytic performance in CO2-ODHP reactions.

这篇文献没有提供关于不同Ga2O3多形体及其对CO2-ODHP反应影响的全面信息。它只提到β-Ga2O3是主要的且唯一稳定的形式。文档表明，氧化镓的酸性位点可能是丙烷脱氢的活性位点。催化活性部分与催化剂的比表面积相关。然而，该论文没有讨论详细的机理或比较不同的Ga2O3多形体。需要进行更多的研究才能全面回答关于各种Ga2O3多形体的结构特征、表面性质和Lewis酸位如何影响它们在CO2-ODHP反应中的催化性能的问题。
