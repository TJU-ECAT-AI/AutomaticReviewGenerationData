[1] "For all of the Ga2O3 samples the major phase was confirmed to be -Ga2O3 which is the only stable form of Ga2O3 known."

[2] "Probably, the acidic sites of gallium oxide were the active sites of the dehydrogenation of propane."

[3] "The decrease in the catalytic activity is partly correlated with the decrease in the specific surface area of the catalyst."

The literature does not provide comprehensive information about the influence of different Ga2O3 polymorphs on CO2-ODHP reactions. It only mentions that β-Ga2O3 is the only stable form known and was the major phase detected in all samples. The study focuses mainly on β-Ga2O3.

The acidity of the catalyst appears to play a crucial role in its catalytic performance. The acidic sites of gallium oxide are suggested to be the active sites for propane dehydrogenation. This is supported by the observation that potassium promotion, which likely decreases acidity, leads to a loss of catalytic activity.

Surface properties, particularly surface area, also influence catalytic performance. The decrease in catalytic activity was partly correlated with a decrease in the specific surface area of the catalyst.

The study does not provide detailed information about Lewis acid sites or proposed mechanisms to explain activity trends and selectivity during different stages of the reaction. More comprehensive research would be needed to fully address these aspects of the question.

该文献并未提供不同Ga2O3多形体对CO2-ODHP反应影响的全面信息。它只提到β-Ga2O3是唯一已知的稳定形式，并在所有样品中检测到的主要相。该研究主要集中在β-Ga2O3上。

催化剂的酸性似乎在其催化性能中起着关键作用。氧化镓的酸性位点被认为是丙烷脱氢的活性位点。这一观点得到了钾促进导致催化活性下降的观察结果的支持，因为钾促进可能会降低酸性。

表面性质，特别是比表面积，也影响催化性能。催化活性的降低部分与催化剂比表面积的降低相关。

该研究没有提供关于Lewis酸位点的详细信息，也没有提出解释反应不同阶段活性趋势和选择性的机理。需要更全面的研究才能完全回答这些问题的各个方面。
