The literature does not provide comprehensive information about different Ga2O3 polymorphs and their influence on CO2-ODHP reactions. It only mentions β-Ga2O3 as the major and only stable form. The study focuses primarily on β-Ga2O3.

The acidic sites on gallium oxide appear to be the active sites for propane dehydrogenation. This is supported by the observation that potassium promotion, which likely reduces surface acidity, leads to a loss of catalytic activity.

Surface properties, particularly surface area, influence catalytic performance. A decrease in specific surface area correlates with decreased catalytic activity.

The promoting effect of CO2 is only observed in the initial reaction stage, suggesting it may play a role in activating the catalyst surface or removing initial carbon deposits. However, CO2 does not prevent catalyst deactivation over time.

The mechanisms for initial and steady-state activity are not explicitly described. However, the data suggests initial activity may involve CO2 activation of the surface or removal of carbon deposits, while steady-state activity is likely limited by coke formation and deactivation of acid sites.

The literature does not provide sufficient information to compare the performance of different Ga2O3 polymorphs or to fully explain the mechanisms of their catalytic behavior in CO2-ODHP reactions.

该文献并未提供关于不同Ga2O3多形体及其对CO2-ODHP反应影响的全面信息。它仅提到β-Ga2O3是主要且唯一稳定的形式。该研究主要集中在β-Ga2O3上。

氧化镓的酸性位点似乎是丙烷脱氢的活性位点。这一观点得到了以下观察的支持：钾的添加可能降低了表面酸度，导致催化活性的损失。

表面特性，特别是表面积，影响催化性能。比表面积的减少与催化活性的降低相关。

CO2的促进作用仅在反应初期观察到，这表明它可能在活化催化剂表面或去除初始碳沉积物方面发挥作用。然而，CO2并不能防止催化剂随时间推移而失活。

文献并未明确描述初始和稳态活性的机理。然而，数据表明初始活性可能涉及CO2活化表面或去除碳沉积物，而稳态活性可能受到焦炭形成和酸性位点失活的限制。

该文献没有提供足够的信息来比较不同Ga2O3多形体的性能，或充分解释它们在CO2-ODHP反应中的催化行为机理。
