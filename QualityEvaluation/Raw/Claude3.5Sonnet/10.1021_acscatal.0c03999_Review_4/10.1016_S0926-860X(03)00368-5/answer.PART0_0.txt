[1] "For all of the Ga2O3 samples the major phase was confirmed to be -Ga2O3 which is the only stable form of Ga2O3 known."

[2] "Ga2O3-based catalysts have been proved to be active in dehydrogenation or amortisation of light alkanes [10] and in selective catalytic reduction of NOx by hydrocarbons in the presence of oxygen [11]. It is well known that the catalytic activity of gallium oxide catalysts is strongly influenced by their acidity/basicity properties."

[3] "On the other hand, the Lewis acid sites are suspected to be active in ethane dehydrogenation [8]."

[4] "The introduction of potassium to the gallium oxide leads to loss of the catalytic activity. The reaction seems to proceed on acidic sites of the catalyst, since potassium promoted Ga2O3 catalysts do not exhibit high activity."

The literature does not provide comprehensive information about different Ga2O3 polymorphs and their influence on CO2-ODHP reactions. However, it does offer some insights into the catalytic properties of Ga2O3:

1. The β-Ga2O3 phase is identified as the only stable form of Ga2O3 and was the major phase in all samples tested.

2. The catalytic activity of gallium oxide catalysts is strongly influenced by their acidity/basicity properties. 

3. Lewis acid sites are thought to be active in dehydrogenation reactions, specifically mentioned for ethane dehydrogenation.

4. The reaction appears to proceed on acidic sites of the catalyst. This is supported by the observation that introducing potassium (which would increase basicity) leads to a loss of catalytic activity.

The literature does not provide detailed information on the mechanisms explaining activity trends and selectivity during different stages of the reaction. It also doesn't discuss the structural characteristics and surface properties of different Ga2O3 polymorphs in depth. More research would be needed to fully answer the question about how these factors influence catalytic performance in CO2-ODHP reactions.

该文献没有提供关于不同Ga2O3多形体及其对CO2-ODHP反应影响的全面信息。但是，它确实提供了一些关于Ga2O3催化性质的见解：

1. β-Ga2O3相被确定为Ga2O3唯一稳定的形式，是所有测试样品中的主要相。

2. 氧化镓催化剂的催化活性受其酸碱性质的强烈影响。

3. 路易斯酸位被认为在脱氢反应中是活性的，特别提到了乙烷脱氢。

4. 反应似乎在催化剂的酸性位点上进行。这一点得到了以下观察的支持：引入钾（会增加碱性）会导致催化活性的丧失。

该文献没有提供关于反应不同阶段活性趋势和选择性的详细机制解释。它也没有深入讨论不同Ga2O3多形体的结构特征和表面性质。需要进行更多研究才能全面回答这些因素如何影响CO2-ODHP反应中的催化性能这一问题。
