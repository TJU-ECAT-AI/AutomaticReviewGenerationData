[1] "Ga2O3-based catalysts have been proved to be active in dehydrogenation or amortisation of light alkanes [10] and in selective catalytic reduction of NOx by hydrocarbons in the presence of oxygen [11]. It is well known that the catalytic activity of gallium oxide catalysts is strongly influenced by their acidity/basicity properties."

[2] "On the other hand, the Lewis acid sites are suspected to be active in ethane dehydrogenation [8]."

[3] "For all of the Ga2O3 samples the major phase was confirmed to be -Ga2O3 which is the only stable form of Ga2O3 known."

[4] "The reaction seems to proceed on acidic sites of the catalyst, since potassium promoted Ga2O3 catalysts do not exhibit high activity."

The literature provides limited information on the specific influence of different Ga2O3 polymorphs on CO2-ODHP reactions. However, it does offer some insights into the general catalytic properties of Ga2O3:

1. The catalytic activity of gallium oxide catalysts is strongly influenced by their acidity/basicity properties.

2. Lewis acid sites are believed to play an active role in alkane dehydrogenation reactions.

3. β-Ga2O3 is identified as the only stable form of Ga2O3 and was the major phase detected in the catalysts studied.

4. Acidic sites on the catalyst surface appear to be crucial for the reaction, as evidenced by the loss of catalytic activity when potassium (a basic promoter) was added to Ga2O3.

The literature does not provide detailed information on the mechanisms explaining activity trends and selectivity during different stages of the reaction. However, it suggests that the presence of acidic sites, particularly Lewis acid sites, on the Ga2O3 surface is important for catalytic performance in dehydrogenation reactions.

To fully answer the question, more research would be needed on the specific structural characteristics and surface properties of different Ga2O3 polymorphs and their influence on CO2-ODHP reactions.

这篇文献对不同Ga2O3多形体在CO2-ODHP反应中的具体影响提供的信息有限。但它确实提供了一些关于Ga2O3一般催化性质的见解：

1. 氧化镓催化剂的催化活性受其酸碱性质的强烈影响。

2. 路易斯酸位被认为在烷烃脱氢反应中起着活跃作用。

3. β-Ga2O3被认为是Ga2O3唯一稳定的形式，并且是研究的催化剂中检测到的主要相。

4. 催化剂表面的酸性位点似乎对反应至关重要，这一点从向Ga2O3中加入钾（一种碱性促进剂）后催化活性降低可以得到证实。

文献没有提供详细解释反应不同阶段活性趋势和选择性的机制信息。然而，它表明Ga2O3表面上存在酸性位点，特别是路易斯酸位点，对脱氢反应的催化性能很重要。

要全面回答这个问题，还需要对不同Ga2O3多形体的具体结构特征和表面性质及其对CO2-ODHP反应的影响进行更多研究。
