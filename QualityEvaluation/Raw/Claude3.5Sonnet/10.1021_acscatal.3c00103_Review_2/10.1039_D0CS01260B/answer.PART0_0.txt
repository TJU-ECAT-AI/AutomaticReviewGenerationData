[1] "Advanced synthesis strategies, including but not limited to ALD and SOMC approaches, are necessary to finely control the structure of Pt- or oxide-based active sites in the DH catalysts."

[2] "By localizing, using proper supports such as oxides and zeolites through the SMSI effect and confinement effect, the subnanometric or SA/SAA Pt-related metal sites exhibit unique catalytic performances in comparison with the larger metal ensembles."

[3] "The electronic properties of metallic Pt and other active metals or metal oxides can be finely modified by the promoters or supports; for instance, the Sn-shifted d-band center of the Pt atom and the N-doped carbon matrix-tuned 3d orbit energy of the single-atom V site consequently reduce the interaction between catalysts and olefin intermediates for the easy desorption of olefin products."

[4] "The geometric modification on the active sites through isolation effects is also useful to prevent the strong adsorption of coke precursors or their polymerization, and thus to reduce the formation of coke species."

[5] "For the selected support, the elimination of the possible active sites responsible for coking is necessary. The alkaline additives are widely used for the oxide-based supports, while the high-silica or pure-silica zeolites are also adopted as the supports, in view of their lower surface acidity."

Recent strategies to enhance catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts in direct dehydrogenation processes include:

1. Advanced synthesis methods like ALD and SOMC to precisely control active site structures.

2. Using proper supports (oxides, zeolites) to create subnanometric or single-atom/single-atom alloy sites through SMSI and confinement effects.

3. Electronic modification of active metals/oxides using promoters or supports to reduce interaction with olefin intermediates and facilitate product desorption.

4. Geometric modification via isolation effects to prevent coke precursor adsorption and polymerization.

5. Support selection and modification to eliminate coking sites, such as using alkaline additives for oxide supports or high/pure-silica zeolites with lower acidity.

These advancements address challenges in catalyst design and performance by enabling precise control over active site structure and properties, enhancing stability and selectivity, and mitigating coking issues. This allows for the development of more efficient and durable catalysts for industrial dehydrogenation applications.

最近为提高直接脱氢过程中负载金属催化剂的催化稳定性而开发的策略包括：

1. 采用先进的合成方法，如ALD和SOMC，精确控制活性位点结构。

2. 利用适当的载体（氧化物、分子筛）通过SMSI和限域效应创造亚纳米级或单原子/单原子合金位点。

3. 使用助剂或载体对活性金属/氧化物进行电子修饰，减少与烯烃中间体的相互作用，促进产物脱附。

4. 通过隔离效应进行几何修饰，防止焦炭前体吸附和聚合。

5. 选择和修饰载体以消除焦炭形成位点，如对氧化物载体使用碱性添加剂或采用低酸度的高硅/纯硅分子筛。

这些进展通过实现对活性位点结构和性质的精确控制、增强稳定性和选择性以及缓解焦炭问题，解决了催化剂设计和性能方面的挑战。这使得能够开发出更高效、更耐用的工业脱氢应用催化剂。
