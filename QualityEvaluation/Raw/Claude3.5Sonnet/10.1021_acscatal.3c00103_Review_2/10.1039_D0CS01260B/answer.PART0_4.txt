[1] "Advanced synthesis strategies, including but not limited to ALD and SOMC approaches, are necessary to finely control the structure of Pt- or oxide-based active sites in the DH catalysts."

[2] "Benefiting from the utilization of the high-resolution characterization techniques, e.g., in situ XAS and HAADF-STEM, the effective structural information of the catalysts can be observed allowing us to establish the real relationships between the adsorption and catalytic properties."

[3] "The localization of metallic atoms or ions on the metal oxide matrix or the zeolite framework may induce the formation of new active sites to be involved in a synergetic reaction mechanism or an undesired pathway."

[4] "The electronic properties of metallic Pt and other active metals or metal oxides can be finely modified by the promoters or supports; for instance, the Sn-shifted d-band center of the Pt atom and the N-doped carbon matrix-tuned 3d orbit energy of the single-atom V site consequently reduce the interaction between catalysts and olefin intermediates for the easy desorption of olefin products."

[5] "The geometric modification on the active sites through isolation effects is also useful to prevent the strong adsorption of coke precursors or their polymerization, and thus to reduce the formation of coke species."

[6] "For the selected support, the elimination of the possible active sites responsible for coking is necessary. The alkaline additives are widely used for the oxide-based supports, while the high-silica or pure-silica zeolites are also adopted as the supports, in view of their lower surface acidity."

[7] "Although the SMSI effects can effectively stabilize the active sites against the high reaction temperature and reductive atmosphere in the DH reactions, overly strong interactions cause the active metals to be embedded into subsurface, lattice layers or the framework, and therefore reduces the accessibility or even the intrinsic activity of the active sites."

Recent strategies to enhance catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts in direct dehydrogenation processes include:

1. Advanced synthesis methods like ALD and SOMC to precisely control active site structures.

2. Use of high-resolution characterization techniques like in situ XAS and HAADF-STEM to understand catalyst structure-property relationships.

3. Localization of metal atoms/ions on oxide or zeolite supports to create synergistic active sites.

4. Electronic modification of active metals using promoters or supports to reduce interactions with intermediates and facilitate product desorption.

5. Geometric isolation of active sites to prevent coke precursor adsorption and polymerization.

6. Elimination of coking-prone sites on supports through use of alkaline additives or high-silica/pure-silica zeolites.

7. Careful tuning of metal-support interactions to stabilize active sites without over-embedding them and reducing accessibility.

These advancements address challenges in catalyst design and performance by providing greater control over active site structures and properties, improving stability against coking and sintering, and optimizing metal-support interactions for enhanced activity and selectivity. The use of advanced characterization enables deeper understanding of working catalysts to guide rational design. Overall, these strategies aim to develop more efficient, selective and durable catalysts suitable for industrial dehydrogenation applications.
