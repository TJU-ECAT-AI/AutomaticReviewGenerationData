[1] "Advanced synthesis strategies, including but not limited to ALD and SOMC approaches, are necessary to finely control the structure of Pt- or oxide-based active sites in the DH catalysts."

[2] "By localizing, using proper supports such as oxides and zeolites through the SMSI effect and confinement effect, the subnanometric or SA/SAA Pt-related metal sites exhibit unique catalytic performances in comparison with the larger metal ensembles."

[3] "The localization of metallic atoms or ions on the metal oxide matrix or the zeolite framework may induce the formation of new active sites to be involved in a synergetic reaction mechanism or an undesired pathway."

[4] "Several strategies have been performed to solve this problem. The electronic properties of metallic Pt and other active metals or metal oxides can be finely modified by the promoters or supports"

[5] "The geometric modification on the active sites through isolation effects is also useful to prevent the strong adsorption of coke precursors or their polymerization, and thus to reduce the formation of coke species."

[6] "For the selected support, the elimination of the possible active sites responsible for coking is necessary. The alkaline additives are widely used for the oxide-based supports, while the high-silica or pure-silica zeolites are also adopted as the supports, in view of their lower surface acidity."

[7] "The reaction atmosphere is another factor affecting the formation of coke species, and the co-feeding of steam vapor and hydrogen is a reported method able to reduce the coke amount."

Recent key strategies to enhance catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts in direct dehydrogenation processes include:

1. Advanced synthesis methods like ALD and SOMC to precisely control active site structures.

2. Using proper supports (oxides, zeolites) to create subnanometric or single-atom/single-atom alloy sites through strong metal-support interactions and confinement effects.

3. Modifying electronic properties of active metals/oxides using promoters or supports.

4. Geometric modification through isolation effects to prevent coke precursor adsorption and polymerization.

5. Eliminating coking-prone sites on supports by using alkaline additives or high-silica/pure-silica zeolites.

6. Optimizing reaction atmosphere by co-feeding steam or hydrogen to reduce coke formation.

These approaches address challenges in catalyst design and performance by:

- Enabling precise control over active site structure and properties
- Enhancing metal dispersion and stability  
- Modifying electronic properties to improve selectivity
- Preventing coke formation through various mechanisms
- Optimizing support properties and reaction conditions

Overall, they aim to create more efficient, selective and stable catalysts by rationally designing catalyst structures from the atomic to macro scale and optimizing reaction engineering aspects.
