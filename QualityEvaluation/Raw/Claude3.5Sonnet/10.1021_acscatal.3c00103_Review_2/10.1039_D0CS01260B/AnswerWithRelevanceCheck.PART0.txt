          [1] "Advanced synthesis strategies, including but not limited to ALD and SOMC approaches, are necessary to finely control the structure of Pt- or oxide-based active sites in the DH catalysts."

[2] "By localizing, using proper supports such as oxides and zeolites through the SMSI effect and confinement effect, the subnanometric or SA/SAA Pt-related metal sites exhibit unique catalytic performances in comparison with the larger metal ensembles."

[3] "The electronic properties of metallic Pt and other active metals or metal oxides can be finely modified by the promoters or supports; for instance, the Sn-shifted d-band center of the Pt atom and the N-doped carbon matrix-tuned 3d orbit energy of the single-atom V site consequently reduce the interaction between catalysts and olefin intermediates for the easy desorption of olefin products."

[4] "The geometric modification on the active sites through isolation effects is also useful to prevent the strong adsorption of coke precursors or their polymerization, and thus to reduce the formation of coke species."

[5] "For the selected support, the elimination of the possible active sites responsible for coking is necessary. The alkaline additives are widely used for the oxide-based supports, while the high-silica or pure-silica zeolites are also adopted as the supports, in view of their lower surface acidity."

[6] "Benefiting from the utilization of the high-resolution characterization techniques, e.g., in situ XAS and HAADF-STEM, the effective structural information of the catalysts can be observed allowing us to establish the real relationships between the adsorption and catalytic properties."

[7] "The reaction atmosphere is another factor affecting the formation of coke species, and the co-feeding of steam vapor and hydrogen is a reported method able to reduce the coke amount."

[8] "Although the SMSI effects can effectively stabilize the active sites against the high reaction temperature and reductive atmosphere in the DH reactions, overly strong interactions cause the active metals to be embedded into subsurface, lattice layers or the framework, and therefore reduces the accessibility or even the intrinsic activity of the active sites."

          Key strategies and approaches recently developed to enhance the catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts in direct dehydrogenation processes include:

1. Advanced synthesis methods: Techniques like Atomic Layer Deposition (ALD) and Surface Organometallic Chemistry (SOMC) are used to precisely control the structure of active sites.

2. Optimized support selection: Proper supports such as oxides and zeolites are used to create subnanometric or single-atom/single-atom alloy (SA/SAA) Pt-related metal sites through Strong Metal-Support Interaction (SMSI) and confinement effects.

3. Electronic modification: The electronic properties of active metals or metal oxides are finely tuned using promoters or supports to reduce interaction with olefin intermediates and facilitate product desorption.

4. Geometric modification: Isolation effects are employed to prevent strong adsorption of coke precursors and their polymerization, thus reducing coke formation.

5. Support modification: Alkaline additives are used for oxide-based supports, while high-silica or pure-silica zeolites are adopted to reduce surface acidity and eliminate coking-prone sites.

6. Advanced characterization: High-resolution techniques like in situ XAS and HAADF-STEM are used to observe catalyst structures and establish structure-property relationships.

7. Reaction atmosphere optimization: Co-feeding of steam vapor and hydrogen is used to reduce coke formation.

8. Careful tuning of metal-support interactions: SMSI effects are optimized to stabilize active sites without over-embedding them, maintaining accessibility and activity.

These advancements address challenges in catalyst design, fabrication, and performance optimization by:

- Enabling precise control over active site structure and properties
- Enhancing stability against sintering and coking
- Improving selectivity and activity
- Providing deeper understanding of working catalysts to guide rational design
- Optimizing reaction conditions to minimize deactivation

Overall, these strategies aim to develop more efficient, selective, and durable catalysts suitable for industrial dehydrogenation applications by addressing key issues such as active site control, coking resistance, and long-term stability under reaction conditions.
