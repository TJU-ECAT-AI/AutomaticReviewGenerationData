[1] "Advanced synthesis strategies, including but not limited to ALD and SOMC approaches, are necessary to finely control the structure of Pt- or oxide-based active sites in the DH catalysts."

[2] "By localizing, using proper supports such as oxides and zeolites through the SMSI effect and confinement effect, the subnanometric or SA/SAA Pt-related metal sites exhibit unique catalytic performances in comparison with the larger metal ensembles."

[3] "The electronic properties of metallic Pt and other active metals or metal oxides can be finely modified by the promoters or supports; for instance, the Sn-shifted d-band center of the Pt atom and the N-doped carbon matrix-tuned 3d orbit energy of the single-atom V site consequently reduce the interaction between catalysts and olefin intermediates for the easy desorption of olefin products."

[4] "The geometric modification on the active sites through isolation effects is also useful to prevent the strong adsorption of coke precursors or their polymerization, and thus to reduce the formation of coke species."

[5] "For the selected support, the elimination of the possible active sites responsible for coking is necessary. The alkaline additives are widely used for the oxide-based supports, while the high-silica or pure-silica zeolites are also adopted as the supports, in view of their lower surface acidity."

Recent strategies to enhance catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts in direct dehydrogenation processes include:

1. Advanced synthesis methods like ALD and SOMC to precisely control active site structures.

2. Using proper supports (oxides, zeolites) to achieve SMSI effects and confinement, enabling unique performances of subnanometric or single-atom/single-atom alloy Pt sites.

3. Electronic modification of active sites using promoters or supports to reduce interaction with olefin intermediates and facilitate product desorption.

4. Geometric modification through isolation effects to prevent coke precursor adsorption and polymerization.

5. Careful support selection and modification, such as using alkaline additives for oxide supports or high/pure-silica zeolites, to eliminate coking-prone sites.

These advancements address challenges in catalyst design and performance by:

- Enabling precise control over active site structure and properties
- Enhancing stability against sintering and coking
- Improving selectivity and activity 
- Optimizing support-metal interactions for better performance
- Tailoring electronic and geometric properties for desired catalytic behavior

Overall, these strategies aim to create more efficient, selective, and stable catalysts for industrial dehydrogenation applications by addressing key issues of active site control, coking resistance, and long-term stability.
