[1] "Advanced synthesis strategies, including but not limited to ALD and SOMC approaches, are necessary to finely control the structure of Pt- or oxide-based active sites in the DH catalysts."

[2] "By localizing, using proper supports such as oxides and zeolites through the SMSI effect and confinement effect, the subnanometric or SA/SAA Pt-related metal sites exhibit unique catalytic performances in comparison with the larger metal ensembles."

[3] "The electronic properties of metallic Pt and other active metals or metal oxides can be finely modified by the promoters or supports; for instance, the Sn-shifted d-band center of the Pt atom and the N-doped carbon matrix-tuned 3d orbit energy of the single-atom V site consequently reduce the interaction between catalysts and olefin intermediates for the easy desorption of olefin products."

[4] "The geometric modification on the active sites through isolation effects is also useful to prevent the strong adsorption of coke precursors or their polymerization, and thus to reduce the formation of coke species."

[5] "Although the SMSI effects can effectively stabilize the active sites against the high reaction temperature and reductive atmosphere in the DH reactions, overly strong interactions cause the active metals to be embedded into subsurface, lattice layers or the framework, and therefore reduces the accessibility or even the intrinsic activity of the active sites."

Key strategies and approaches recently developed to enhance the catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts in direct dehydrogenation processes include:

1. Advanced synthesis strategies like atomic layer deposition (ALD) and surface organometallic chemistry (SOMC) to precisely control the structure of active sites.

2. Using proper supports such as oxides and zeolites to create subnanometric or single-atom/single-atom alloy (SA/SAA) Pt-related metal sites through strong metal-support interaction (SMSI) and confinement effects.

3. Modifying the electronic properties of metallic Pt and other active metals or metal oxides using promoters or supports to reduce interaction with olefin intermediates and facilitate product desorption.

4. Geometric modification of active sites through isolation effects to prevent coke precursor adsorption and polymerization.

5. Optimizing the strength of metal-support interactions to balance stability and accessibility of active sites.

These advancements address challenges in catalyst design, fabrication, and performance optimization by:

1. Enabling precise control over active site structure and dispersion.
2. Enhancing catalyst stability against sintering and coking.
3. Improving selectivity by facilitating product desorption.
4. Reducing coke formation through isolation of active sites.
5. Balancing the need for stability with maintaining catalyst activity and accessibility.

These strategies aim to develop more efficient, selective, and stable catalysts for industrial dehydrogenation processes by addressing key issues such as active site control, coke formation, and long-term stability under reaction conditions.
