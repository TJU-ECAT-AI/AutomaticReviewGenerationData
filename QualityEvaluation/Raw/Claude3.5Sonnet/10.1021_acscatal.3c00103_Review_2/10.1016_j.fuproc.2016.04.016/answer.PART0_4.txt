[1] "Bell et al. show that the use of calcined hydrotalcite (Al/Mg  0.1) supported on bimetallic PtGa or PtSn gave very high alkene selectivity and stability, comparable to Pt/Na[Fe]-ZSM-5."

[2] "Elimination of the proton sites of zeolites is critical for obtaining a high alkene selectivity and stability in dehydrogenation catalysts."

[3] "Pt/Na-[Fe]ZSM-5 catalyst with outstanding stability for dehydrogenation of light alkanes. They found that the catalyst deactivation rate of Pt/Na[Fe]-ZSM-5 was lower than for any other Pt-based catalysts in refractory oxide support."

[4] "The unprecedented performance of Pt/Na[Fe]-ZSM-5 was attributed to its high Pt dispersion (cluster size < 1 mm) on zeolite through ion-exchange."

Recent strategies to enhance catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts for direct dehydrogenation include:

1. Using calcined hydrotalcite (Al/Mg ratio ~0.1) as a support for bimetallic PtGa or PtSn catalysts, which provides high alkene selectivity and stability.

2. Eliminating proton sites on zeolite supports to improve alkene selectivity and catalyst stability.

3. Developing Pt/Na[Fe]-ZSM-5 catalysts, which show outstanding stability and lower deactivation rates compared to Pt catalysts on traditional refractory oxide supports.

4. Achieving high Pt dispersion (cluster size < 1 mm) on zeolites through ion-exchange, which contributes to improved catalyst performance and stability.

These advancements address challenges in catalyst design by focusing on support modification, metal dispersion, and reduction of undesired side reactions. They aim to optimize catalyst performance for industrial applications by improving selectivity, stability, and resistance to deactivation in dehydrogenation processes.

最近为提高直接脱氢过程中负载金属催化剂的催化稳定性而开发的策略包括：

1. 使用煅烧的水滑石（Al/Mg比约为0.1）作为双金属PtGa或PtSn催化剂的载体，提供高烯烃选择性和稳定性。

2. 消除沸石载体上的质子位点，以提高烯烃选择性和催化剂稳定性。

3. 开发Pt/Na[Fe]-ZSM-5催化剂，与传统耐火氧化物载体上的Pt催化剂相比，这种催化剂表现出优异的稳定性和更低的失活率。

4. 通过离子交换在沸石上实现高Pt分散度（簇大小<1毫米），这有助于提高催化剂性能和稳定性。

这些进展通过关注载体改性、金属分散和减少不需要的副反应来解决催化剂设计中的挑战。它们旨在通过提高脱氢过程中的选择性、稳定性和抗失活能力来优化催化剂在工业应用中的性能。
