[1] "Pt is the most versatile noble metal catalyst for alkane reactions. Although Pt is expensive, the choice of Pt is often justified by its higher activity, stability and selectivity for these reactions compared to less expensive alternative transition metals."

[2] "Waku et al. exploited the unique property of zeolite as a support for achieving high metal dispersion through cation exchange sites to create a Pt/Na[Fe]-ZSM-5 catalyst with outstanding stability for dehydrogenation of light alkanes."

[3] "They found that the catalyst deactivation rate of Pt/Na[Fe]-ZSM-5 was lower than for any other Pt-based catalysts in refractory oxide support. The unprecedented performance of Pt/Na[Fe]-ZSM-5 was attributed to its high Pt dispersion (cluster size < 1 mm) on zeolite through ion-exchange."

[4] "Promotion of Pt with metals, such as Sn, Ga, Zn, Re, etc., improves catalyst stability, but also leads to faster deactivation rates than Pt/Na[Fe]-ZSM-5."

[5] "Recent reports by Bell et al. show that the use of calcined hydrotalcite (Al/Mg  0.1) supported on bimetallic PtGa or PtSn gave very high alkene selectivity and stability, comparable to Pt/Na[Fe]-ZSM-5."

Recent strategies to enhance catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts for direct dehydrogenation include:

1. Using zeolites as supports to achieve high metal dispersion through cation exchange sites. For example, Pt/Na[Fe]-ZSM-5 showed outstanding stability due to high Pt dispersion (cluster size < 1 mm).

2. Promoting Pt with metals like Sn, Ga, Zn, and Re to improve stability, though this can lead to faster deactivation compared to Pt/Na[Fe]-ZSM-5.

3. Using calcined hydrotalcite (Al/Mg ≈ 0.1) as a support for bimetallic PtGa or PtSn catalysts, which showed high alkene selectivity and stability comparable to Pt/Na[Fe]-ZSM-5.

These advancements address challenges in catalyst design and performance optimization by:

1. Improving metal dispersion to enhance stability and activity.
2. Utilizing promoters to modify catalyst properties.
3. Exploring novel support materials to optimize catalyst performance.

These strategies aim to develop more efficient and stable catalysts for industrial applications, balancing factors like activity, selectivity, and longevity.

最近提高直接脱氢过程中负载金属催化剂催化稳定性的策略包括：

1. 使用沸石作为载体，通过阳离子交换位点实现高金属分散度。例如，由于Pt高度分散（簇大小 < 1 mm），Pt/Na[Fe]-ZSM-5表现出优异的稳定性。

2. 用Sn、Ga、Zn和Re等金属促进Pt以提高稳定性，尽管这可能导致比Pt/Na[Fe]-ZSM-5更快的失活。

3. 使用煅烧的水滑石（Al/Mg ≈ 0.1）作为双金属PtGa或PtSn催化剂的载体，显示出与Pt/Na[Fe]-ZSM-5相当的高烯烃选择性和稳定性。

这些进展通过以下方式解决了催化剂设计和性能优化的挑战：

1. 提高金属分散度以增强稳定性和活性。
2. 利用助剂修改催化剂性质。
3. 探索新型载体材料以优化催化剂性能。

这些策略旨在开发更高效、更稳定的工业应用催化剂，平衡活性、选择性和寿命等因素。
