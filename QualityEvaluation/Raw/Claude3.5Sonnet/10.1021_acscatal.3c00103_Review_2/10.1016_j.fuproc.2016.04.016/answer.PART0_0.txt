[1] "Pt is the most versatile noble metal catalyst for alkane reactions. Although Pt is expensive, the choice of Pt is often justified by its higher activity, stability and selectivity for these reactions compared to less expensive alternative transition metals."

[2] "Waku et al. exploited the unique property of zeolite as a support for achieving high metal dispersion through cation exchange sites to create a Pt/Na[Fe]-ZSM-5 catalyst with outstanding stability for dehydrogenation of light alkanes."

[3] "They found that the catalyst deactivation rate of Pt/Na[Fe]-ZSM-5 was lower than for any other Pt-based catalysts in refractory oxide support. The unprecedented performance of Pt/Na[Fe]-ZSM-5 was attributed to its high Pt dispersion (cluster size < 1 mm) on zeolite through ion-exchange."

[4] "There is a tendency to generate some Brnsted protons on the zeolite during the exchange process, but the choice of Fe3+ as an isomorphous cation in place of Al3+ led to weaker Brnsted sites in [Fe]-ZSM compared to [Al]-ZSM. The weaker acidity minimizes the tendency of side reactions (cracking of oligomerization, aromatisation, and coke), which translates into higher alkene selectivity and catalyst stability."

[5] "Although Pt with conventional refractory oxides (Al2O3, SiO2, ZrO2, etc.) used for dehydrogenation of alkanes has similar conversion rates to Pt/Na[Fe]-ZSM-5, deactivation rates are also rapid due to coke formation."

[6] "Promotion of Pt with metals, such as Sn, Ga, Zn, Re, etc., improves catalyst stability, but also leads to faster deactivation rates than Pt/Na[Fe]-ZSM-5."

[7] "Recent reports by Bell et al. show that the use of calcined hydrotalcite (Al/Mg  0.1) supported on bimetallic PtGa or PtSn gave very high alkene selectivity and stability, comparable to Pt/Na[Fe]-ZSM-5."

Recent strategies to enhance catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts in direct dehydrogenation processes include:

1. Using zeolites as supports to achieve high metal dispersion through cation exchange sites. This approach was demonstrated with Pt/Na[Fe]-ZSM-5, which showed outstanding stability due to high Pt dispersion.

2. Choosing Fe3+ as an isomorphous cation in zeolites instead of Al3+, leading to weaker Brønsted sites. This minimizes side reactions and improves alkene selectivity and catalyst stability.

3. Promoting Pt with metals like Sn, Ga, Zn, and Re to improve stability, although this strategy may lead to faster deactivation compared to Pt/Na[Fe]-ZSM-5.

4. Using calcined hydrotalcite (Al/Mg ≈ 0.1) as a support for bimetallic PtGa or PtSn catalysts, which has shown high alkene selectivity and stability comparable to Pt/Na[Fe]-ZSM-5.

These advancements address challenges in catalyst design by focusing on metal dispersion, acidity control, and bimetallic systems. They aim to minimize coke formation and side reactions while maintaining high activity and selectivity. The use of zeolites and hydrotalcite supports represents innovations in catalyst fabrication, while the promotion with various metals demonstrates efforts to optimize performance for industrial applications.

最近提高直接脱氢过程中负载金属催化剂稳定性的策略包括：

1. 使用沸石作为载体，通过阳离子交换位点实现高金属分散度。这种方法在Pt/Na[Fe]-ZSM-5中得到了证实，由于高铂分散度而显示出优异的稳定性。

2. 选择Fe3+作为沸石中的同晶阳离子而不是Al3+，从而产生较弱的布朗斯特酸位点。这最大限度地减少了副反应，提高了烯烃选择性和催化剂稳定性。

3. 用Sn、Ga、Zn和Re等金属促进Pt以提高稳定性，尽管这种策略可能导致比Pt/Na[Fe]-ZSM-5更快的失活。

4. 使用煅烧的水滑石（Al/Mg ≈ 0.1）作为双金属PtGa或PtSn催化剂的载体，已显示出与Pt/Na[Fe]-ZSM-5相当的高烯烃选择性和稳定性。

这些进展通过关注金属分散、酸度控制和双金属系统来解决催化剂设计中的挑战。它们旨在最大限度地减少焦炭形成和副反应，同时保持高活性和选择性。沸石和水滑石载体的使用代表了催化剂制备的创新，而各种金属的促进则展示了为工业应用优化性能的努力。
