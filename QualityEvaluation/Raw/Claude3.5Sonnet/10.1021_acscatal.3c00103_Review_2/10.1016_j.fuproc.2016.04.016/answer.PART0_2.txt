[1] "Pt is the most versatile noble metal catalyst for alkane reactions. Although Pt is expensive, the choice of Pt is often justified by its higher activity, stability and selectivity for these reactions compared to less expensive alternative transition metals."

[2] "Waku et al. exploited the unique property of zeolite as a support for achieving high metal dispersion through cation exchange sites to create a Pt/Na[Fe]-ZSM-5 catalyst with outstanding stability for dehydrogenation of light alkanes."

[3] "The unprecedented performance of Pt/Na[Fe]-ZSM-5 was attributed to its high Pt dispersion (cluster size < 1 mm) on zeolite through ion-exchange. There is a tendency to generate some Brnsted protons on the zeolite during the exchange process, but the choice of Fe3+ as an isomorphous cation in place of Al3+ led to weaker Brnsted sites in [Fe]-ZSM compared to [Al]-ZSM."

[4] "Gaab et al. investigated the kinetics and mechanisms for ODH of ethane using the catalysts Li/Dy/Mg/O/and Li/Dy/Mg/O/(Cl). The catalysts were prepared by impregnation of Dy2O3Mg/O with LiNO3 and LiCl, leading to Li/Dy/Mg/O/and Li/Dy/Mg/O/(Cl), respectively."

Recent strategies to enhance catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts for direct dehydrogenation include:

1. Using platinum as the active metal due to its superior activity, stability and selectivity compared to cheaper alternatives.

2. Employing zeolites as supports to achieve high metal dispersion through cation exchange sites. For example, Pt/Na[Fe]-ZSM-5 showed outstanding stability due to high Pt dispersion.

3. Careful selection of zeolite framework composition, such as using Fe3+ instead of Al3+ to create weaker Brønsted acid sites and improve stability.

4. Impregnation with alkali and alkaline earth metals like Li, Mg, and Dy to modify catalyst properties.

5. Addition of halides like chloride to create active sites and enhance performance.

These advancements address challenges in catalyst design by:

- Optimizing metal-support interactions 
- Controlling acidity/basicity of the support
- Tailoring the electronic properties of active sites
- Improving dispersion and preventing sintering of metal particles
- Creating novel active sites through promoter addition

The strategies aim to develop more stable and selective catalysts that can withstand the harsh conditions of industrial dehydrogenation processes while maintaining high activity over extended periods.

最近为提高直接脱氢过程中负载金属催化剂的催化稳定性而开发的关键策略包括：

1. 使用铂作为活性金属，因为与较便宜的替代品相比，它具有更高的活性、稳定性和选择性。

2. 利用沸石作为载体，通过阳离子交换位点实现高金属分散度。例如，Pt/Na[Fe]-ZSM-5由于高铂分散度而表现出优异的稳定性。

3. 仔细选择沸石骨架组成，例如使用Fe3+代替Al3+来创造较弱的Brønsted酸位点并提高稳定性。

4. 用碱金属和碱土金属如Li、Mg和Dy进行浸渍，以改变催化剂性质。

5. 添加卤化物如氯化物来创造活性位点并增强性能。

这些进展通过以下方式解决了催化剂设计中的挑战：

- 优化金属-载体相互作用
- 控制载体的酸度/碱度
- 调整活性位点的电子性质
- 改善金属粒子的分散度并防止烧结
- 通过添加助剂创造新型活性位点

这些策略旨在开发更稳定、更选择性的催化剂，能够在保持高活性的同时withstand工业脱氢过程的苛刻条件长时间运行。
