[1] "Waku et al. exploited the unique property of zeolite as a support for achieving high metal dispersion through cation exchange sites to create a Pt/Na[Fe]-ZSM-5 catalyst with outstanding stability for dehydrogenation of light alkanes."

[2] "They found that the catalyst deactivation rate of Pt/Na[Fe]-ZSM-5 was lower than for any other Pt-based catalysts in refractory oxide support. The unprecedented performance of Pt/Na[Fe]-ZSM-5 was attributed to its high Pt dispersion (cluster size < 1 mm) on zeolite through ion-exchange."

[3] "Although Pt with conventional refractory oxides (Al2O3, SiO2, ZrO2, etc.) used for dehydrogenation of alkanes has similar conversion rates to Pt/Na[Fe]-ZSM-5, deactivation rates are also rapid due to coke formation."

[4] "However, recent reports by Bell et al. show that the use of calcined hydrotalcite (Al/Mg  0.1) supported on bimetallic PtGa or PtSn gave very high alkene selectivity and stability, comparable to Pt/Na[Fe]-ZSM-5."

Recent strategies to enhance catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts for direct dehydrogenation include:

1. Using zeolites as supports to achieve high metal dispersion through cation exchange sites. Pt/Na[Fe]-ZSM-5 shows outstanding stability due to high Pt dispersion (cluster size < 1 mm).

2. Employing bimetallic catalysts. PtGa and PtSn supported on calcined hydrotalcite exhibit high alkene selectivity and stability.

3. Modifying support materials. Using Fe-substituted zeolites instead of conventional refractory oxides reduces deactivation rates from coke formation.

4. Optimizing metal-support interactions. Ion-exchange of Pt onto zeolites creates stronger interactions than impregnation on oxide supports.

These advancements address challenges in catalyst design by:

- Improving metal dispersion to increase active site accessibility 
- Enhancing resistance to coking and sintering
- Tuning electronic properties of active sites through bimetallic formulations
- Optimizing support acidity/basicity to control side reactions

For industrial applications, these strategies offer improved catalyst lifetime, higher alkene yields, and potentially milder operating conditions. However, further work is needed to scale up production of these advanced catalysts and evaluate their long-term stability under industrial conditions.

最近为提高直接脱氢过程中负载金属催化剂的催化稳定性而开发的关键策略包括：

1. 使用沸石作为载体，通过阳离子交换位实现高金属分散度。Pt/Na[Fe]-ZSM-5由于高Pt分散度(簇大小<1mm)而表现出优异的稳定性。

2. 采用双金属催化剂。负载在煅烧水滑石上的PtGa和PtSn表现出高烯烃选择性和稳定性。

3. 改性载体材料。使用Fe取代的沸石代替传统的耐火氧化物可减少因积碳造成的失活率。

4. 优化金属-载体相互作用。Pt通过离子交换到沸石上比浸渍到氧化物载体上创造了更强的相互作用。

这些进展通过以下方式解决了催化剂设计中的挑战：

- 提高金属分散度以增加活性位点的可及性
- 增强抗积碳和烧结能力
- 通过双金属配方调节活性位点的电子性质
- 优化载体酸碱性以控制副反应

对于工业应用，这些策略提供了改进的催化剂寿命、更高的烯烃产率，并可能实现更温和的操作条件。然而，仍需进一步工作来扩大这些先进催化剂的生产规模，并评估它们在工业条件下的长期稳定性。
