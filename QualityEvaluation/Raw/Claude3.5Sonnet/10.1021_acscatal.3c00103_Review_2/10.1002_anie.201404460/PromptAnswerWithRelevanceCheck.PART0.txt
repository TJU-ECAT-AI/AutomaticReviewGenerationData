[1] "A novel catalyst material for the selective dehydrogenation of propane is presented. The catalyst consists of 1000ppm Pt, 3wt% Ga, and 0.25wt% K supported on alumina. We observed a synergy between Ga and Pt, resulting in a highly active and stable catalyst."

[2] "The catalysts show somewhat higher values for conversion at the start of a dehydrogenation cycle, which then slowly drop during the 15min cycle."

[3] "After the first PDH cycle, the conversion and selectivity of the catalysts does not drop, verifying that the catalysts are not deactivated."

[4] "For the eighth cycle, the values of propane conversion and propene selectivity have dropped for all catalysts. The deactivation is the least severe for those catalysts containing both Pt and Ga."

[5] "Long-term stability experiment with the Pt3GaK catalyst, which was cycled for ca. 150 times over a 14day period. During the first two days both the conversion and selectivity drop, after which the catalyst performance remains stable for 12days on stream."

[6] "As Table1 shows, the presence of K results in less darkening of the catalyst material, due to less coke being deposited."

[7] "We postulate that the Pt assists in the recombination of the hydrogen atoms on the catalyst, making the active sites available for the following dehydrogenation cycle."

Key strategies and approaches recently developed to enhance the catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts in direct dehydrogenation processes include:

1. Synergistic combination of metals: The study presents a novel catalyst combining Pt, Ga, and K supported on alumina, which shows high activity and stability due to the synergy between Ga and Pt.

2. Optimized metal loadings: The catalyst uses low Pt content (1000 ppm) combined with higher Ga content (3 wt%), resulting in improved stability and activity.

3. Addition of promoters: Incorporating K (0.25 wt%) into the catalyst helps reduce coke deposition and improve selectivity.

4. Bifunctional active phase: The catalyst design utilizes Ga as the primary active species for dehydrogenation, with Pt serving as a promoter to assist in hydrogen recombination and active site regeneration.

5. High-temperature regeneration: The study employs a cyclic process with high-temperature (750°C) regeneration steps, which helps maintain catalyst activity over multiple cycles.

6. Mixed oxide formation: The preparation method leads to the formation of a mixed Al-Ga oxide, which enhances the stability of Ga species and prevents reduction under reaction conditions.

These advancements address challenges in catalyst design and performance optimization by:

1. Improving long-term stability: The Pt-Ga-K catalyst maintains stable performance over extended periods (12 days) after an initial break-in period.

2. Reducing coking: The addition of K and the synergistic effect of Pt and Ga help minimize coke formation on the catalyst surface.

3. Enhancing selectivity: The combination of metals and promoters results in high selectivity towards the desired propene product.

4. Maintaining high activity: The catalyst design allows for high propane conversion rates close to equilibrium values.

5. Resistance to deactivation: The synergistic effect between Pt and Ga results in less severe deactivation compared to catalysts containing only one of these metals.

These improvements contribute to better catalyst performance and longevity in industrial applications, potentially leading to more efficient and economical propane dehydrogenation processes.
