[1] "Here we present a new family of very stable, active, and selective catalyst materials for the dehydrogenation of propane to propene based on PtGa/Al2O3."

[2] "A clear synergistic effect is observed between both components, which results in a very stable catalyst material that is highly resistant to deactivation, e.g., by coking."

[3] "Alkali metal dopants, such as K, are known to increase the propene selectivity and decrease coke deposition by poisoning the Brnsted acid sites present in the PDH catalysts."

[4] "When K is present on the catalyst, these sites are poisoned, inhibiting the formation of coke."

[5] "We postulate that the Pt assists in the recombination of the hydrogen atoms on the catalyst, making the active sites available for the following dehydrogenation cycle."

Recent strategies to enhance catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts in direct dehydrogenation processes include:

1. Developing synergistic multi-component catalysts: The study presents a PtGa/Al2O3 catalyst that shows high stability and resistance to deactivation due to the synergy between Pt and Ga.

2. Adding alkali metal dopants: Incorporation of potassium (K) increases propene selectivity and decreases coke deposition by poisoning Brønsted acid sites on the catalyst surface.

3. Optimizing metal combinations: The combination of Pt and Ga creates a bifunctional catalyst where Ga performs the dehydrogenation and Pt acts as a unique promoter.

4. Controlling metal dispersion and interaction: The presence of Pt affects the distribution of Ga on the catalyst surface, leading to more active tetrahedral Ga3+ species.

5. Designing stable mixed oxide supports: A mixed Al-Ga oxide support is formed, which is resistant to reduction and maintains catalyst stability.

6. Facilitating hydrogen management: Pt assists in the recombination of hydrogen atoms, regenerating active sites for subsequent dehydrogenation cycles.

These advancements address challenges in catalyst design by improving stability, selectivity, and resistance to coking, which are crucial for industrial applications. The approach of combining multiple components (Pt, Ga, K) on a modified support (Al2O3) demonstrates a comprehensive strategy for optimizing catalyst performance in propane dehydrogenation.

最近在直接脱氢过程中提高负载金属催化剂稳定性的关键策略包括：

1. 开发协同多组分催化剂：研究提出了一种PtGa/Al2O3催化剂，由于Pt和Ga之间的协同作用，显示出高稳定性和抗失活性。

2. 添加碱金属掺杂剂：通过在催化剂表面毒化Brønsted酸性位点，掺入钾(K)可以提高丙烯选择性并减少积碳。

3. 优化金属组合：Pt和Ga的组合创造了一种双功能催化剂，其中Ga执行脱氢反应，Pt作为独特的促进剂。

4. 控制金属分散和相互作用：Pt的存在影响了Ga在催化剂表面的分布，产生更多活性四面体Ga3+物种。

5. 设计稳定的混合氧化物载体：形成了抗还原性的Al-Ga混合氧化物载体，保持了催化剂的稳定性。

6. 促进氢气管理：Pt协助氢原子的重组，为后续脱氢循环再生活性位点。

这些进展通过提高稳定性、选择性和抗积碳性能解决了催化剂设计中的挑战，这对工业应用至关重要。将多个组分（Pt、Ga、K）结合在改性载体（Al2O3）上的方法展示了一种优化丙烷脱氢催化剂性能的全面策略。
