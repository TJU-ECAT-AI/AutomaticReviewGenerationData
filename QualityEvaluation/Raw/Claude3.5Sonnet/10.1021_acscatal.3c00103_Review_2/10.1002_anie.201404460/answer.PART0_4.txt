[1] "Here we present a new family of very stable, active, and selective catalyst materials for the dehydrogenation of propane to propene based on PtGa/Al2O3."

[2] "A clear synergistic effect is observed between both components, which results in a very stable catalyst material that is highly resistant to deactivation, e.g., by coking."

[3] "Alkali metal dopants, such as K, are known to increase the propene selectivity and decrease coke deposition by poisoning the Brnsted acid sites present in the PDH catalysts."

[4] "We postulate that the Pt assists in the recombination of the hydrogen atoms on the catalyst, making the active sites available for the following dehydrogenation cycle."

[5] "The catalyst is highly resistant to coking and remains active for prolonged reaction times."

Recent strategies to enhance catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts for direct dehydrogenation processes include:

1. Developing synergistic multi-component catalysts, such as PtGa/Al2O3, which show improved stability and resistance to deactivation compared to single-component catalysts.

2. Adding alkali metal dopants like potassium to increase selectivity and decrease coke deposition by neutralizing acidic sites on the catalyst surface.

3. Optimizing the interaction between different catalyst components, such as using platinum to assist in hydrogen recombination and regeneration of active sites.

4. Designing catalysts with resistance to coking and long-term stability under reaction conditions.

5. Carefully controlling the dispersion and interaction of active components on the support material to maintain catalyst performance over time.

These advancements address challenges in catalyst design by creating more robust and efficient catalysts that can withstand harsh reaction conditions and maintain activity for longer periods. This helps optimize performance for industrial applications by reducing the need for frequent catalyst regeneration or replacement, improving selectivity towards desired products, and enhancing overall process efficiency.

最近为提高直接脱氢过程中负载金属催化剂的催化稳定性而开发的策略包括：

1. 开发协同多组分催化剂，如PtGa/Al2O3，与单组分催化剂相比，这种催化剂表现出更好的稳定性和抗失活能力。

2. 添加碱金属掺杂剂（如钾），通过中和催化剂表面的酸性位点来提高选择性并减少积碳沉积。

3. 优化不同催化剂组分之间的相互作用，例如使用铂来协助氢气重组和活性位点的再生。

4. 设计具有抗积碳能力和长期稳定性的催化剂，以适应反应条件。

5. 仔细控制活性组分在载体材料上的分散和相互作用，以长期维持催化剂性能。

这些进展通过创造更加稳健和高效的催化剂来解决催化剂设计中的挑战，使其能够承受苛刻的反应条件并长期保持活性。这有助于优化工业应用的性能，减少频繁的催化剂再生或更换需求，提高对目标产物的选择性，并提升整体过程效率。
