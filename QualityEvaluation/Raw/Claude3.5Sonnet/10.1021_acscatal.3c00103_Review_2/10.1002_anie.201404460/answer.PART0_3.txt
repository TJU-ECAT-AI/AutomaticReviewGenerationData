[1] "Here we present a new family of very stable, active, and selective catalyst materials for the dehydrogenation of propane to propene based on PtGa/Al2O3."

[2] "A clear synergistic effect is observed between both components, which results in a very stable catalyst material that is highly resistant to deactivation, e.g., by coking."

[3] "Alkali metal dopants, such as K, are known to increase the propene selectivity and decrease coke deposition by poisoning the Brnsted acid sites present in the PDH catalysts."

[4] "For the eighth cycle, the values of propane conversion and propene selectivity have dropped for all catalysts. The deactivation is the least severe for those catalysts containing both Pt and Ga."

[5] "We postulate that the Pt assists in the recombination of the hydrogen atoms on the catalyst, making the active sites available for the following dehydrogenation cycle."

Recent strategies to enhance catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts in direct dehydrogenation processes include:

1. Developing synergistic multi-component catalysts: The study presents a PtGa/Al2O3 catalyst that shows high stability and resistance to deactivation due to the synergy between Pt and Ga components.

2. Incorporating alkali metal dopants: Addition of potassium (K) increases propene selectivity and decreases coke deposition by poisoning Brønsted acid sites.

3. Optimizing metal combinations: Catalysts containing both Pt and Ga show the least severe deactivation over multiple cycles, indicating improved stability.

4. Promoting hydrogen recombination: Pt is postulated to assist in recombining hydrogen atoms, keeping active sites available for subsequent dehydrogenation cycles.

5. Creating mixed metal oxides: Formation of a mixed Al-Ga oxide structure contributes to catalyst stability by making Ga less reducible.

These advancements address challenges in catalyst design by improving resistance to coking, maintaining activity over multiple cycles, and optimizing metal interactions for enhanced stability and selectivity. The novel PtGa/Al2O3 catalyst with K dopant demonstrates superior performance compared to traditional catalysts, showing promise for industrial applications in propane dehydrogenation.

最近在直接脱氢过程中提高负载金属催化剂催化稳定性的策略包括：

1. 开发协同多组分催化剂：该研究提出了一种PtGa/Al2O3催化剂，由于Pt和Ga组分之间的协同作用，表现出高稳定性和抗失活性。

2. 引入碱金属掺杂剂：添加钾（K）通过毒化Brønsted酸位来提高丙烯选择性并减少积碳沉积。

3. 优化金属组合：含有Pt和Ga的催化剂在多个循环中表现出最轻微的失活，表明稳定性得到提高。

4. 促进氢气重组：推测Pt有助于重组氢原子，使活性位点可用于后续脱氢循环。

5. 创建混合金属氧化物：形成Al-Ga混合氧化物结构通过使Ga更难被还原来提高催化剂稳定性。

这些进展通过改善抗积碳性能、保持多个循环的活性以及优化金属相互作用以提高稳定性和选择性，解决了催化剂设计中的挑战。新型PtGa/Al2O3催化剂与K掺杂剂相比传统催化剂表现出优越的性能，显示出在丙烷脱氢工业应用中的潜力。
