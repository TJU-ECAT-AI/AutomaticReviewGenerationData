[1] "To alleviate these problems, Sn is introduced to form an alloy with Pt nanoparticles and thereby dilute the Pt surface with inactive Sn atoms and break up coke-generating Pt ensembles."

[2] "Our search for a highly active and more durable PDH catalyst has focused on using a siliceous MFI zeolite with a hierarchical micro-/mesoporous structure as a replacement for the alumina support."

[3] "We intentionally generated silanol nests by synthesizing a mesoporous gallosilicate zeolite and subsequently removing the framework Ga atoms using nitric acid"

[4] "The formation of the Pt3La and Pt3Y nanoparticles on the degallated zeolite brought a striking enhancement in all aspects of the PDH catalytic performance, including activity, selectivity and durability"

[5] "The high PDH catalytic performance of PtLa/mz-deGa and PtY/mz-deGa can be ascribed to the critical role of surface silanol nests that enabled atomistic alloying of La and Y into Pt nanoparticles."

Recent strategies to enhance catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts in direct dehydrogenation processes include:

1. Alloying Pt with other metals like Sn to dilute the Pt surface and reduce coke formation.

2. Using hierarchical micro-/mesoporous zeolites as supports instead of traditional alumina.

3. Generating silanol nests in zeolite supports through synthesis of gallosilicate zeolites followed by degallation.

4. Formation of intermetallic compounds like Pt3La and Pt3Y nanoparticles on degallated zeolite supports.

5. Utilizing surface silanol nests to enable atomistic alloying of rare earth elements like La and Y with Pt.

These advancements address challenges in catalyst design and performance by:

- Improving resistance to coking and deactivation
- Enhancing metal dispersion and stability 
- Enabling formation of novel intermetallic compounds
- Providing better control over alloy composition and structure
- Significantly increasing catalyst lifetime, activity and selectivity

The use of engineered zeolite supports with silanol nests allows for precise control over metal alloying at the atomic level, opening up new possibilities for catalyst design and optimization for industrial dehydrogenation processes.
