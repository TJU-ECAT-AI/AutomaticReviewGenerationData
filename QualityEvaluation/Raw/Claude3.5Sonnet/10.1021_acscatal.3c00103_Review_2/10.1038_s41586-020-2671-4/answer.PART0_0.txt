[1] "To alleviate these problems, Sn is introduced to form an alloy with Pt nanoparticles and thereby dilute the Pt surface with inactive Sn atoms and break up coke-generating Pt ensembles."

[2] "Our search for a highly active and more durable PDH catalyst has focused on using a siliceous MFI zeolite with a hierarchical micro-/mesoporous structure as a replacement for the alumina support."

[3] "We incorporated La and Y along with Pt into this mesoporous zeolite to improve the Pt catalyst dispersion, as these rare-earth element (REE) oxides are known for their strong metalsupport interactions with Pt that stabilize the latter in the form of small nanoparticles"

[4] "We intentionally generated silanol nests by synthesizing a mesoporous gallosilicate zeolite and subsequently removing the framework Ga atoms using nitric acid"

[5] "The formation of the Pt3La and Pt3Y nanoparticles on the degallated zeolite brought a striking enhancement in all aspects of the PDH catalytic performance, including activity, selectivity and durability"

Recent strategies to enhance catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts in direct dehydrogenation processes include:

1. Alloying Pt with other metals like Sn to dilute the Pt surface and reduce coke formation.

2. Using hierarchical micro-/mesoporous zeolites as catalyst supports instead of traditional alumina.

3. Incorporating rare-earth elements like La and Y with Pt to improve dispersion and stability through strong metal-support interactions.

4. Generating silanol nests in zeolites by synthesizing gallosilicate zeolites and removing framework Ga atoms.

5. Forming intermetallic compounds like Pt3La and Pt3Y nanoparticles on degallated zeolites.

These advancements address challenges in catalyst design by:

- Improving resistance to coking and deactivation
- Enhancing metal dispersion and stability
- Enabling formation of novel alloy structures
- Optimizing support properties for better catalytic performance
- Significantly increasing catalyst lifetime and durability

The use of zeolites with tailored porosity and surface chemistry, along with precise control of metal-support interactions and alloy formation, allows for more efficient and longer-lasting catalysts for industrial dehydrogenation processes.
