[1] "To alleviate these problems, Sn is introduced to form an alloy with Pt nanoparticles and thereby dilute the Pt surface with inactive Sn atoms and break up coke-generating Pt ensembles."

[2] "Our search for a highly active and more durable PDH catalyst has focused on using a siliceous MFI zeolite with a hierarchical micro-/mesoporous structure as a replacement for the alumina support."

[3] "We incorporated La and Y along with Pt into this mesoporous zeolite to improve the Pt catalyst dispersion, as these rare-earth element (REE) oxides are known for their strong metalsupport interactions with Pt that stabilize the latter in the form of small nanoparticles"

[4] "With these assumptions, we intentionally generated silanol nests by synthesizing a mesoporous gallosilicate zeolite and subsequently removing the framework Ga atoms using nitric acid"

[5] "The formation of the Pt3La and Pt3Y nanoparticles on the degallated zeolite brought a striking enhancement in all aspects of the PDH catalytic performance, including activity, selectivity and durability"

Recent advancements in enhancing catalytic stability for direct dehydrogenation processes include:

1. Alloying Pt with Sn to dilute the Pt surface and reduce coke formation.

2. Using hierarchical micro-/mesoporous MFI zeolites as support materials instead of traditional alumina.

3. Incorporating rare-earth elements (REEs) like La and Y with Pt to improve catalyst dispersion and stability through strong metal-support interactions.

4. Intentionally creating silanol nests in zeolite supports by synthesizing gallosilicate zeolites and removing framework Ga atoms.

5. Forming intermetallic compounds like Pt3La and Pt3Y nanoparticles on degallated zeolites.

These strategies address challenges in catalyst design and performance optimization by:

1. Reducing coke formation and improving catalyst longevity.
2. Enhancing reactant and product diffusion through hierarchical porous structures.
3. Stabilizing small metal nanoparticles and improving their dispersion.
4. Enabling the formation of novel intermetallic compounds that were previously difficult to synthesize.
5. Significantly improving catalytic activity, selectivity, and durability in reactions like propane dehydrogenation.

These advancements pave the way for more efficient and stable catalysts in industrial applications, potentially reducing the need for frequent catalyst regeneration and improving overall process economics.
