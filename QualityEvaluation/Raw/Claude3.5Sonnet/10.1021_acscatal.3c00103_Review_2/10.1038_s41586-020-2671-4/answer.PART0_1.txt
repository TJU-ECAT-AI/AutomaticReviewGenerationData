[1] "To alleviate these problems, Sn is introduced to form an alloy with Pt nanoparticles and thereby dilute the Pt surface with inactive Sn atoms and break up coke-generating Pt ensembles."

[2] "Our search for a highly active and more durable PDH catalyst has focused on using a siliceous MFI zeolite with a hierarchical micro-/mesoporous structure as a replacement for the alumina support."

[3] "We incorporated La and Y along with Pt into this mesoporous zeolite to improve the Pt catalyst dispersion, as these rare-earth element (REE) oxides are known for their strong metalsupport interactions with Pt that stabilize the latter in the form of small nanoparticles"

[4] "We intentionally generated silanol nests by synthesizing a mesoporous gallosilicate zeolite and subsequently removing the framework Ga atoms using nitric acid"

[5] "The formation of the Pt3La and Pt3Y nanoparticles on the degallated zeolite brought a striking enhancement in all aspects of the PDH catalytic performance, including activity, selectivity and durability"

Recent strategies to enhance catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts in direct dehydrogenation processes include:

1. Forming alloys with Pt nanoparticles: Introducing elements like Sn to dilute the Pt surface and break up coke-generating Pt ensembles.

2. Using hierarchical micro-/mesoporous zeolites as supports: Replacing traditional alumina supports with siliceous MFI zeolites that have both micro- and mesopores.

3. Incorporating rare-earth elements: Adding elements like La and Y along with Pt to improve catalyst dispersion through strong metal-support interactions.

4. Generating silanol nests: Creating framework defects in zeolites by synthesizing gallosilicate zeolites and then removing Ga atoms, resulting in silanol nest sites.

5. Forming intermetallic compounds: Developing Pt3La and Pt3Y nanoparticles on degallated zeolites, which significantly enhance catalytic performance in terms of activity, selectivity, and durability.

These advancements address challenges in catalyst design by improving coke resistance, enhancing metal dispersion, and creating more stable and active catalytic sites. They also optimize performance by leveraging novel support materials and intermetallic compounds, potentially leading to more efficient and long-lasting catalysts for industrial applications.

最近提高直接脱氢过程中负载金属催化剂稳定性的策略包括：

1. 形成铂纳米粒子合金：引入锡等元素来稀释铂表面并打破生成积炭的铂集合体。

2. 使用具有微孔/介孔层级结构的沸石作为载体：用具有微孔和介孔的硅质MFI沸石替代传统的氧化铝载体。

3. 掺入稀土元素：加入镧、钇等元素与铂一起，通过强金属-载体相互作用改善催化剂分散性。

4. 生成硅羟基巢：通过合成镓硅沸石然后去除镓原子来在沸石中创造框架缺陷，形成硅羟基巢位点。

5. 形成金属间化合物：在脱镓沸石上开发Pt3La和Pt3Y纳米粒子，显著提高催化性能，包括活性、选择性和耐久性。

这些进展通过改善抗积炭性能、增强金属分散性和创造更稳定、更活跃的催化位点来解决催化剂设计中的挑战。它们还利用新型载体材料和金属间化合物优化性能，有可能带来更高效、更持久的工业应用催化剂。
