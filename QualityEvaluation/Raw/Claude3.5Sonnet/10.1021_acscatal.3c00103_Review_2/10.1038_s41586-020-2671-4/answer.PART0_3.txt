[1] "To alleviate these problems, Sn is introduced to form an alloy with Pt nanoparticles and thereby dilute the Pt surface with inactive Sn atoms and break up coke-generating Pt ensembles."

[2] "We incorporated La and Y along with Pt into this mesoporous zeolite to improve the Pt catalyst dispersion, as these rare-earth element (REE) oxides are known for their strong metalsupport interactions with Pt that stabilize the latter in the form of small nanoparticles"

[3] "With these assumptions, we intentionally generated silanol nests by synthesizing a mesoporous gallosilicate zeolite and subsequently removing the framework Ga atoms using nitric acid"

[4] "The formation of the Pt3La and Pt3Y nanoparticles on the degallated zeolite brought a striking enhancement in all aspects of the PDH catalytic performance, including activity, selectivity and durability"

[5] "The high PDH catalytic performance of PtLa/mz-deGa and PtY/mz-deGa can be ascribed to the critical role of surface silanol nests that enabled atomistic alloying of La and Y into Pt nanoparticles."

Recent key strategies to enhance catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts in direct dehydrogenation processes include:

1. Alloying Pt with other metals: Introducing elements like Sn to form alloys with Pt nanoparticles helps dilute the Pt surface and break up coke-generating Pt ensembles.

2. Using rare-earth elements (REEs): Incorporating REEs like La and Y with Pt improves catalyst dispersion due to strong metal-support interactions that stabilize small Pt nanoparticles.

3. Employing mesoporous zeolites: Using mesoporous zeolites as supports, especially those with intentionally generated silanol nests, enables better dispersion and stabilization of metal nanoparticles.

4. Creating intermetallic compounds: Forming Pt3La and Pt3Y nanoparticles on degallated zeolites significantly enhances activity, selectivity, and durability in propane dehydrogenation (PDH).

5. Utilizing silanol nests: Surface silanol nests play a critical role in enabling atomistic alloying of REEs into Pt nanoparticles, leading to high catalytic performance.

These advancements address challenges in catalyst design and performance optimization by:

- Reducing coke formation and improving catalyst longevity
- Enhancing metal dispersion and stability
- Enabling formation of novel intermetallic compounds
- Improving overall catalytic performance in terms of activity, selectivity, and durability

These strategies offer promising directions for developing more efficient and stable catalysts for industrial dehydrogenation processes.
