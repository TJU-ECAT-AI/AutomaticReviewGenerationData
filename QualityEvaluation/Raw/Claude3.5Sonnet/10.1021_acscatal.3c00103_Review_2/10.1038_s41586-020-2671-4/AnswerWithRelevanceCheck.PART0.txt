          [1] "To alleviate these problems, Sn is introduced to form an alloy with Pt nanoparticles and thereby dilute the Pt surface with inactive Sn atoms and break up coke-generating Pt ensembles."

[2] "Our search for a highly active and more durable PDH catalyst has focused on using a siliceous MFI zeolite with a hierarchical micro-/mesoporous structure as a replacement for the alumina support."

[3] "We incorporated La and Y along with Pt into this mesoporous zeolite to improve the Pt catalyst dispersion, as these rare-earth element (REE) oxides are known for their strong metalsupport interactions with Pt that stabilize the latter in the form of small nanoparticles"

[4] "We intentionally generated silanol nests by synthesizing a mesoporous gallosilicate zeolite and subsequently removing the framework Ga atoms using nitric acid"

[5] "The formation of the Pt3La and Pt3Y nanoparticles on the degallated zeolite brought a striking enhancement in all aspects of the PDH catalytic performance, including activity, selectivity and durability"

[6] "The high PDH catalytic performance of PtLa/mz-deGa and PtY/mz-deGa can be ascribed to the critical role of surface silanol nests that enabled atomistic alloying of La and Y into Pt nanoparticles."

          Recent key strategies and approaches to enhance the catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts in direct dehydrogenation processes include:

1. Alloying Pt with other metals: Introducing elements like Sn to form alloys with Pt nanoparticles helps dilute the Pt surface, break up coke-generating Pt ensembles, and reduce coke formation.

2. Using hierarchical micro-/mesoporous zeolites: Employing siliceous MFI zeolites with hierarchical pore structures as supports instead of traditional alumina enhances reactant and product diffusion.

3. Incorporating rare-earth elements (REEs): Adding REEs like La and Y along with Pt improves catalyst dispersion and stability through strong metal-support interactions that stabilize small Pt nanoparticles.

4. Generating silanol nests: Intentionally creating silanol nests in zeolite supports by synthesizing gallosilicate zeolites and removing framework Ga atoms enables better dispersion and stabilization of metal nanoparticles.

5. Forming intermetallic compounds: Creating Pt3La and Pt3Y nanoparticles on degallated zeolites significantly enhances activity, selectivity, and durability in propane dehydrogenation (PDH).

These advancements address challenges in catalyst design, fabrication, and performance optimization for industrial applications by:

- Reducing coke formation and improving catalyst longevity
- Enhancing metal dispersion and stability
- Enabling formation of novel intermetallic compounds
- Improving overall catalytic performance in terms of activity, selectivity, and durability
- Providing better control over alloy composition and structure at the atomic level
- Potentially reducing the need for frequent catalyst regeneration and improving process economics

These strategies offer promising directions for developing more efficient, stable, and long-lasting catalysts for industrial dehydrogenation processes.
