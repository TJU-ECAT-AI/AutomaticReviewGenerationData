[1] "Many strategies have been suggested to reduce the formation of coke by doping additional promoters including Sn, In, Ga, Mn, Cu and Zn to Pt, which can effectively increase the electron density of Pt atoms and weaken the adsorption of the product alkene, thus reducing coke deposition."

[2] "To improve the stability of Pt-based catalysts, many efforts have been dedicated to strengthen metal–support interactions by using various methods including the nanopore-encaged metal strategy, wet-chemistry approach and modification of supports."

[3] "Herein, highly stable Pt/Sn-Si-beta catalysts were prepared via an improved post-synthesis method and used for PDH, which exhibited high catalytic activity, good selectivity and excellent stability."

[4] "The influence of the interaction between Pt and Sn confined in the Si-beta framework on the catalytic performance of the Pt/Sn-Si-beta catalyst was investigated in detail."

[5] "The strong Pt–Sn interactions and the confinement effect of Sn in the Si-beta framework inhibit the coke and sintering of Pt clusters, thereby achieving good stability of dehydrogenation and regeneration with almost unchanged catalytic activity during four cycles at 550 °C."

Recent key strategies and approaches developed to enhance the catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts in direct dehydrogenation processes include:

1. Doping additional promoters: Elements like Sn, In, Ga, Mn, Cu, and Zn are added to Pt catalysts to increase electron density of Pt atoms and weaken product alkene adsorption, reducing coke deposition.

2. Strengthening metal-support interactions: Methods such as nanopore-encaged metal strategy, wet-chemistry approach, and modification of supports are used to improve catalyst stability.

3. Improved post-synthesis methods: Highly stable catalysts like Pt/Sn-Si-beta are prepared using advanced synthesis techniques, resulting in high catalytic activity, good selectivity, and excellent stability.

4. Confinement of promoter elements: Confining promoter elements (e.g., Sn) in zeolite frameworks (e.g., Si-beta) enhances interactions with the active metal (e.g., Pt) and improves overall catalyst performance.

5. Optimizing metal-promoter interactions: Investigating and optimizing interactions between the active metal and promoter (e.g., Pt-Sn interactions) within the support structure to inhibit coke formation and metal sintering.

These advancements address challenges in catalyst design, fabrication, and performance optimization for industrial applications by:

1. Reducing coke formation and improving catalyst longevity.
2. Enhancing metal dispersion and preventing sintering.
3. Increasing catalytic activity and selectivity.
4. Improving catalyst regenerability and stability over multiple cycles.
5. Providing a deeper understanding of metal-support and metal-promoter interactions for better catalyst design.
