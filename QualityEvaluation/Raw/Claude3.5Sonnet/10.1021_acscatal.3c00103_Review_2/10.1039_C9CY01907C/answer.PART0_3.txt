[1] "Many strategies have been suggested to reduce the formation of coke by doping additional promoters including Sn, In, Ga, Mn, Cu and Zn to Pt, which can effectively increase the electron density of Pt atoms and weaken the adsorption of the product alkene, thus reducing coke deposition."

[2] "To improve the stability of Pt-based catalysts, many efforts have been dedicated to strengthen metal–support interactions by using various methods including the nanopore-encaged metal strategy, wet-chemistry approach and modification of supports."

[3] "Herein, highly stable Pt/Sn-Si-beta catalysts were prepared via an improved post-synthesis method and used for PDH, which exhibited high catalytic activity, good selectivity and excellent stability."

[4] "The strong Pt–Sn interactions and the confinement effect of Sn in the Si-beta framework inhibit the coke and sintering of Pt clusters, thereby achieving good stability of dehydrogenation and regeneration with almost unchanged catalytic activity during four cycles at 550 °C."

Recent key strategies to enhance catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts in direct dehydrogenation processes include:

1. Doping additional promoters (e.g. Sn, In, Ga, Mn, Cu, Zn) to increase electron density of Pt atoms and reduce coke deposition.

2. Strengthening metal-support interactions through methods like nanopore-encaged metal strategy, wet-chemistry approach, and modification of supports.

3. Using improved post-synthesis methods to prepare highly stable catalysts, as demonstrated with Pt/Sn-Si-beta catalysts.

4. Confining promoter elements (e.g. Sn) in zeolite frameworks to create strong metal-promoter interactions and inhibit coke formation and metal sintering.

These advancements address challenges in catalyst design and performance by:

- Reducing coke formation and improving catalyst regenerability
- Enhancing metal dispersion and preventing sintering
- Increasing catalytic activity, selectivity and stability
- Enabling longer catalyst lifetimes and improved process economics for industrial applications

The Pt/Sn-Si-beta catalyst system described demonstrates how these strategies can be combined to achieve excellent stability, activity and selectivity in propane dehydrogenation reactions.

直接脱氢过程中支持金属催化剂的催化稳定性增强的最新关键策略包括：

1. 掺杂额外的助剂（如Sn、In、Ga、Mn、Cu、Zn）以增加Pt原子的电子密度并减少焦炭沉积。

2. 通过纳米孔封装金属策略、湿化学方法和改性支撑体等方法加强金属-载体相互作用。

3. 使用改进的后合成方法制备高度稳定的催化剂，如Pt/Sn-Si-beta催化剂所示。

4. 将助剂元素（如Sn）限制在沸石骨架中，以创造强烈的金属-助剂相互作用，并抑制焦炭形成和金属烧结。

这些进展通过以下方式解决了催化剂设计和性能方面的挑战：

- 减少焦炭形成并提高催化剂再生能力
- 增强金属分散度并防止烧结
- 提高催化活性、选择性和稳定性
- 延长催化剂寿命，改善工业应用的过程经济性

所描述的Pt/Sn-Si-beta催化剂系统展示了如何结合这些策略，在丙烷脱氢反应中实现出色的稳定性、活性和选择性。
