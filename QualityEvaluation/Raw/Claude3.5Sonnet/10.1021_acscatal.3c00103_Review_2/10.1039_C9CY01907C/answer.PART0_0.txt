[1] "Many strategies have been suggested to reduce the formation of coke by doping additional promoters including Sn, In, Ga, Mn, Cu and Zn to Pt, which can effectively increase the electron density of Pt atoms and weaken the adsorption of the product alkene, thus reducing coke deposition."

[2] "To improve the stability of Pt-based catalysts, many efforts have been dedicated to strengthen metal–support interactions by using various methods including the nanopore-encaged metal strategy, wet-chemistry approach and modification of supports."

[3] "Herein, highly stable Pt/Sn-Si-beta catalysts were prepared via an improved post-synthesis method and used for PDH, which exhibited high catalytic activity, good selectivity and excellent stability."

[4] "The unique structure of the Pt/Sn-Si-beta catalyst is expected to show good reactivity and stability for PDH."

[5] "The strong interaction between Pt and Sn is investigated using XPS. As shown in Fig. 8a, it can be observed that the binding energy of Sn in 0.3Pt/0.5Sn-Si-beta is increased by 0.5 eV compared to that in 0.5Sn/Si-beta. Simultaneously, a 0.4 eV shift of Pt0 4f7/2 toward a lower binding energy is also observed in 0.3Pt/0.5Sn-Si-beta."

Recent strategies to enhance catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts in direct dehydrogenation processes include:

1. Doping additional promoters: Elements like Sn, In, Ga, Mn, Cu, and Zn are added to Pt catalysts. This increases the electron density of Pt atoms and weakens product alkene adsorption, reducing coke deposition.

2. Strengthening metal-support interactions: Methods such as nanopore-encaged metal strategy, wet-chemistry approach, and modification of supports are used to improve catalyst stability.

3. Improved post-synthesis methods: For example, highly stable Pt/Sn-Si-beta catalysts were prepared using an improved post-synthesis method, showing high catalytic activity, good selectivity, and excellent stability for propane dehydrogenation (PDH).

4. Creating unique catalyst structures: The Pt/Sn-Si-beta catalyst's unique structure contributes to its good reactivity and stability in PDH.

5. Enhancing metal-promoter interactions: Strong interactions between Pt and Sn, as evidenced by XPS studies, contribute to improved catalyst performance and stability.

These advancements address challenges in catalyst design and performance optimization by:
- Reducing coke formation and metal sintering
- Improving catalyst longevity and regenerability
- Enhancing selectivity towards desired products
- Optimizing metal-support and metal-promoter interactions for better stability and activity

These strategies aim to develop more efficient and durable catalysts for industrial dehydrogenation processes, potentially leading to improved process economics and reduced environmental impact.
