[1] "Many strategies have been suggested to reduce the formation of coke by doping additional promoters including Sn, In, Ga, Mn, Cu and Zn to Pt, which can effectively increase the electron density of Pt atoms and weaken the adsorption of the product alkene, thus reducing coke deposition."

[2] "To improve the stability of Pt-based catalysts, many efforts have been dedicated to strengthen metalsupport interactions by using various methods including the nanopore-encaged metal strategy, wet-chemistry approach and modification of supports."

[3] "Herein, highly stable Pt/Sn-Si-beta catalysts were prepared via an improved post-synthesis method and used for PDH, which exhibited high catalytic activity, good selectivity and excellent stability."

[4] "The unique structure of the Pt/Sn-Si-beta catalyst is expected to show good reactivity and stability for PDH."

[5] "The influence of the high propene selectivity and catalytic stability could be explained by strong interaction between Pt and Sn confined in the Si-beta framework."

Recent strategies to enhance the catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts in direct dehydrogenation processes include:

1. Doping additional promoters: Elements like Sn, In, Ga, Mn, Cu, and Zn are added to Pt to increase the electron density of Pt atoms and weaken product alkene adsorption, thus reducing coke deposition.

2. Strengthening metal-support interactions: Methods such as nanopore-encaged metal strategy, wet-chemistry approach, and modification of supports are used to improve catalyst stability.

3. Developing novel catalyst structures: The Pt/Sn-Si-beta catalyst was prepared via an improved post-synthesis method, exhibiting high catalytic activity, good selectivity, and excellent stability for propane dehydrogenation (PDH).

4. Confining promoter elements in zeolite frameworks: The strong interaction between Pt and Sn confined in the Si-beta framework contributes to high propene selectivity and catalytic stability.

These advancements address challenges in catalyst design and performance optimization by:

1. Reducing coke formation and metal sintering, which are major causes of catalyst deactivation.
2. Enhancing metal dispersion and stability through stronger metal-support interactions.
3. Improving selectivity towards desired products by modifying the electronic properties of active metal sites.
4. Developing catalysts with better regeneration capabilities and longer lifetimes for industrial applications.

最近提高直接脱氢过程中负载金属催化剂稳定性的策略包括：

1. 掺杂额外的助剂：向铂中添加锡、铟、镓、锰、铜和锌等元素，以增加铂原子的电子密度并减弱产物烯烃的吸附，从而减少积碳沉积。

2. 加强金属-载体相互作用：采用纳米孔封装金属策略、湿化学方法和载体改性等方法来提高催化剂稳定性。

3. 开发新型催化剂结构：通过改进的后合成方法制备Pt/Sn-Si-beta催化剂，在丙烷脱氢(PDH)反应中表现出高催化活性、良好的选择性和优异的稳定性。

4. 将助剂元素限制在沸石骨架中：铂与限制在Si-beta骨架中的锡之间的强相互作用有助于提高丙烯选择性和催化稳定性。

这些进展通过以下方式解决了催化剂设计和性能优化的挑战：

1. 减少积碳形成和金属烧结，这是催化剂失活的主要原因。
2. 通过更强的金属-载体相互作用增强金属分散性和稳定性。
3. 通过修改活性金属位点的电子性质来提高对目标产物的选择性。
4. 开发具有更好再生能力和更长寿命的催化剂，以适应工业应用。
