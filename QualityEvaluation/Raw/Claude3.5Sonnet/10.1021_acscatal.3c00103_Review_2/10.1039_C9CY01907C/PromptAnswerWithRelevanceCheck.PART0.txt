[1] "Many strategies have been suggested to reduce the formation of coke by doping additional promoters including Sn, In, Ga, Mn, Cu and Zn to Pt, which can effectively increase the electron density of Pt atoms and weaken the adsorption of the product alkene, thus reducing coke deposition."

[2] "To improve the stability of Pt-based catalysts, many efforts have been dedicated to strengthen metal–support interactions by using various methods including the nanopore-encaged metal strategy, wet-chemistry approach and modification of supports."

[3] "Herein, highly stable Pt/Sn-Si-beta catalysts were prepared via an improved post-synthesis method and used for PDH, which exhibited high catalytic activity, good selectivity and excellent stability."

[4] "The unique structure of the Pt/Sn-Si-beta catalyst is expected to show good reactivity and stability for PDH."

[5] "The strong interaction between Pt and Sn is investigated using XPS. As shown in Fig. 8a, it can be observed that the binding energy of Sn in 0.3Pt/0.5Sn-Si-beta is increased by 0.5 eV compared to that in 0.5Sn/Si-beta. Simultaneously, a 0.4 eV shift of Pt0 4f7/2 toward a lower binding energy is also observed in 0.3Pt/0.5Sn-Si-beta."
