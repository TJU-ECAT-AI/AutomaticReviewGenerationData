[1] "Many strategies have been suggested to reduce the formation of coke by doping additional promoters including Sn, In, Ga, Mn, Cu and Zn to Pt, which can effectively increase the electron density of Pt atoms and weaken the adsorption of the product alkene, thus reducing coke deposition."

[2] "To improve the stability of Pt-based catalysts, many efforts have been dedicated to strengthen metal–support interactions by using various methods including the nanopore-encaged metal strategy, wet-chemistry approach and modification of supports."

[3] "Herein, highly stable Pt/Sn-Si-beta catalysts were prepared via an improved post-synthesis method and used for PDH, which exhibited high catalytic activity, good selectivity and excellent stability."

[4] "The unique structure of the Pt/Sn-Si-beta catalyst is expected to show good reactivity and stability for PDH."

[5] "These results indicate a superior anti-sintering ability for Pt clusters supported on Sn-Si-beta."

Recent strategies to enhance catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts in direct dehydrogenation processes include:

1. Doping additional promoters (Sn, In, Ga, Mn, Cu, Zn) to Pt to increase electron density and reduce coke formation.

2. Strengthening metal-support interactions through methods like nanopore-encaged metal strategy, wet-chemistry approach, and modification of supports.

3. Developing improved post-synthesis methods, as demonstrated by the Pt/Sn-Si-beta catalysts which showed high activity, selectivity and stability.

4. Creating unique catalyst structures, like Pt clusters supported on Sn-Si-beta, which exhibit superior anti-sintering ability.

These advancements address challenges in catalyst design and performance by:

- Reducing coke deposition and improving catalyst longevity
- Enhancing metal-support interactions to prevent sintering
- Optimizing synthesis methods for better control over catalyst structure and properties
- Developing novel support materials that can stabilize active metal species

The Pt/Sn-Si-beta catalyst presented in this study exemplifies how these strategies can be combined to create a highly stable and selective catalyst for industrial dehydrogenation applications. Its unique structure, with Pt clusters strongly interacting with Sn sites confined in the Si-beta framework, demonstrates the potential for significant improvements in catalyst stability and performance through careful design and synthesis.
