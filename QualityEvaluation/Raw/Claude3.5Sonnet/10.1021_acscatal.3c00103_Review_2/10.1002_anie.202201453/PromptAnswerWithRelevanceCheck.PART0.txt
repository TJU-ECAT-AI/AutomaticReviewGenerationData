[1] "The modification of metal oxides by noble metals has been proved to be an effective strategy to improve the low reactivity of metal oxides in catalyzing PDH."

[2] "Researchers have proposed various regulatory mechanisms of noble metals on metal oxides. Gong and co-workers revealed that ZnO was promoted to be a stronger Lewis acid through the electron transfer from metal oxide to Pt, which attenuated the reduction of ZnO and enhanced the stability."

[3] "Kondratenko and co-workers suggested that low hydrogen adsorption energy barrier on Rh was favorable for H2 dissociation into H atoms and spillover onto the surface of ZrO2. Thus, the lattice oxygen was removed from ZrO2 to generate more coordinately unsaturated Zr4+ sites for PDH reaction."

[4] "With trace amounts (<0.15wt%) of noble metals, PDH reaction performance on zirconia can be enhanced prominently."

[5] "The low deactivation rate (kd=0.03h1) at 550C demonstrates its high stability"

Recent key strategies and approaches to enhance catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts in direct dehydrogenation processes include:

1. Modification of metal oxides with noble metals: This has been shown to improve the low reactivity of metal oxides in catalyzing propane dehydrogenation (PDH).

2. Promoting metal oxides to be stronger Lewis acids: For example, ZnO can be promoted through electron transfer from the metal oxide to Pt, which attenuates ZnO reduction and enhances stability.

3. Facilitating H2 dissociation and spillover: Noble metals like Rh can lower the hydrogen adsorption energy barrier, promoting H2 dissociation and spillover onto the oxide surface. This can remove lattice oxygen and generate more active sites.

4. Using trace amounts of noble metals: Even very small amounts (<0.15 wt%) of noble metals can significantly enhance PDH performance on supports like zirconia.

5. Optimizing metal-support interactions: The right combination of metal and support can lead to low deactivation rates and high stability, as demonstrated by some catalysts achieving low deactivation rates at high temperatures.

These advancements address challenges in catalyst design and performance optimization by enhancing activity, stability, and efficiency of PDH catalysts. They provide strategies to overcome limitations of pure metal oxide catalysts while minimizing the use of expensive noble metals, making them more suitable for industrial applications.

Thus, the lattice oxygen was removed from ZrO2 to generate more coordinately unsaturated Zr4+ sites for PDH reaction."

[2] "The modification of metal oxides by noble metals has been proved to be an effective strategy to improve the low reactivity of metal oxides in catalyzing PDH."

[3] "Optimally, 0.03Pt3Ga2O3 catalyst obtains about 97mmolg1h1 of propylene formation rate, which exceeds 25% of the summed contribution of individual 0.03Pt and 3Ga2O3, and achieves the most noticeable synergistic effect. It achieves 12% of propane conversion, 88% of total propylene selectivity and 95% of propylene gas phase selectivity (FigureS1a,b).
