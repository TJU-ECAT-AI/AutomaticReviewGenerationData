[1] "The modification of metal oxides by noble metals has been proved to be an effective strategy to improve the low reactivity of metal oxides in catalyzing PDH."

[2] "Weckhuysen and co-workers4a have found that with 1000ppm Pt modification, propane conversion was doubled in comparison with pure Ga2O3."

[3] "The presence of Pt promotes H2 dissociation and surface coverage of hydrogen species, which is beneficial for the activation of CH in propane."

[4] "Optimally, 0.03Pt3Ga2O3 catalyst obtains about 97mmolg1h1 of propylene formation rate, which exceeds 25% of the summed contribution of individual 0.03Pt and 3Ga2O3, and achieves the most noticeable synergistic effect."

[5] "The low deactivation rate (kd=0.03h1) at 550C demonstrates its high stability"

Recent strategies to enhance catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts in direct dehydrogenation processes include:

1. Modification of metal oxides with noble metals: This strategy has been shown to improve the reactivity of metal oxides in propane dehydrogenation (PDH). For example, adding small amounts of platinum to gallium oxide significantly increases propane conversion.

2. Optimizing metal loading: Studies have found that an optimal amount of noble metal (e.g., 0.03 wt% Pt on Ga2O3) can achieve the most notable synergistic effect, leading to higher propylene formation rates than individual components.

3. Promoting hydrogen dissociation and spillover: The presence of noble metals like Pt promotes H2 dissociation and increases surface coverage of hydrogen species, which is beneficial for C-H activation in propane.

4. Creating synergistic effects: The interaction between noble metals and metal oxides can lead to performance improvements beyond the sum of their individual contributions.

5. Controlling surface species: Maintaining an optimal concentration of certain surface species (e.g., Gaδ+H in Pt-Ga2O3 systems) can enhance catalyst activity and stability.

These advancements address challenges in catalyst design by:

- Improving catalyst activity and selectivity
- Enhancing stability and reducing deactivation rates
- Optimizing metal-support interactions
- Controlling surface chemistry for better performance

These strategies provide a foundation for developing more efficient and stable catalysts for industrial PDH applications, though further research is needed to fully optimize these systems for large-scale use.

最近为提高直接脱氢过程中负载金属催化剂的催化稳定性而开发的关键策略和方法包括：

1. 用贵金属改性金属氧化物：这种策略已被证明可以提高金属氧化物在丙烷脱氢(PDH)中的反应活性。例如，向氧化镓中添加少量铂可显著提高丙烷转化率。

2. 优化金属负载量：研究发现，适量的贵金属（如在Ga2O3上负载0.03 wt%的Pt）可以实现最显著的协同效应，导致比单独组分更高的丙烯生成速率。

3. 促进氢气解离和溢流：贵金属（如Pt）的存在促进了H2解离，增加了表面氢物种的覆盖率，有利于丙烷中C-H键的活化。

4. 创造协同效应：贵金属和金属氧化物之间的相互作用可以带来超出其个别贡献总和的性能改进。

5. 控制表面物种：保持某些表面物种的最佳浓度（例如Pt-Ga2O3系统中的Gaδ+H）可以提高催化剂的活性和稳定性。

这些进展通过以下方式解决了催化剂设计中的挑战：

- 提高催化剂活性和选择性
- 增强稳定性并降低失活率
- 优化金属-载体相互作用
- 控制表面化学以获得更好的性能

这些策略为开发更高效、更稳定的工业PDH应用催化剂奠定了基础，尽管还需要进一步研究以充分优化这些系统以供大规模使用。
