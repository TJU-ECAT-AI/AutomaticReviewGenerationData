Recent strategies to enhance catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts for direct dehydrogenation include:

1. Modification of metal oxides with noble metals: This approach has been shown to improve the low reactivity of metal oxides in propane dehydrogenation (PDH).

2. Use of trace amounts of noble metals: Adding small quantities (<0.15 wt%) of noble metals to zirconia can significantly enhance PDH performance.

3. Optimizing metal loading: For example, 0.03Pt3Ga2O3 catalyst showed optimal performance, achieving a 25% increase in propylene formation rate compared to individual components.

4. Synergistic effects: Proper combination of metals and metal oxides can lead to synergistic effects, enhancing overall catalytic performance.

5. Temperature control: Operating at appropriate temperatures (e.g., 550°C) can result in low deactivation rates, improving catalyst stability.

These advancements address challenges in catalyst design by optimizing metal-support interactions, enhancing activity and selectivity, and improving stability for industrial applications. The research focuses on finding the right balance of components and operating conditions to maximize performance while minimizing catalyst deactivation.

最近为提高直接脱氢过程中负载金属催化剂的催化稳定性而开发的关键策略和方法包括：

1. 用贵金属改性金属氧化物：这种方法已被证明可以提高金属氧化物在丙烷脱氢(PDH)中的低反应活性。

2. 使用微量贵金属：向氧化锆中添加少量（<0.15 wt%）贵金属可显著提高PDH性能。

3. 优化金属负载量：例如，0.03Pt3Ga2O3催化剂显示出最佳性能，其丙烯生成率比单个组分提高25%。

4. 协同效应：金属和金属氧化物的适当组合可产生协同效应，提高整体催化性能。

5. 温度控制：在适当的温度下操作（如550°C）可导致低失活率，提高催化剂稳定性。

这些进展通过优化金属-载体相互作用、提高活性和选择性以及改善工业应用的稳定性来解决催化剂设计中的挑战。研究重点是找到组分和操作条件的正确平衡，以最大化性能，同时最小化催化剂失活。
