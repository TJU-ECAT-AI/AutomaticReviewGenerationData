[1] "Kondratenko and co-workers6b suggested that low hydrogen adsorption energy barrier on Rh was favorable for H2 dissociation into H atoms and spillover onto the surface of ZrO2. Thus, the lattice oxygen was removed from ZrO2 to generate more coordinately unsaturated Zr4+ sites for PDH reaction."

[2] "The modification of metal oxides by noble metals has been proved to be an effective strategy to improve the low reactivity of metal oxides in catalyzing PDH."

[3] "Optimally, 0.03Pt3Ga2O3 catalyst obtains about 97mmolg1h1 of propylene formation rate, which exceeds 25% of the summed contribution of individual 0.03Pt and 3Ga2O3, and achieves the most noticeable synergistic effect. It achieves 12% of propane conversion, 88% of total propylene selectivity and 95% of propylene gas phase selectivity (FigureS1a,b). The low deactivation rate (kd=0.03h1) at 550C demonstrates its high stability (FigureS1d)."

Recent strategies to enhance catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts in direct dehydrogenation processes include:

1. Modification of metal oxides with noble metals: This approach has been shown to improve the reactivity of metal oxide catalysts in propane dehydrogenation (PDH).

2. Utilizing synergistic effects: Combining metals like Pt with metal oxides like Ga2O3 can create catalysts with enhanced performance compared to individual components.

3. Optimizing metal loading: Finding the optimal metal content (e.g. 0.03 wt% Pt on Ga2O3) can maximize catalytic activity and stability.

4. Promoting hydrogen spillover: Noble metals like Rh can facilitate H2 dissociation and spillover onto metal oxide supports, creating more active sites.

5. Generating coordinately unsaturated metal sites: Removal of lattice oxygen can create more active metal sites for the dehydrogenation reaction.

These advancements address challenges in catalyst design by:

- Improving activity and selectivity
- Enhancing stability and reducing deactivation rates
- Optimizing metal-support interactions for synergistic effects
- Creating more active sites through structural modifications
- Balancing metal loading to maximize performance

While further research is needed, these strategies show promise for developing more efficient and stable catalysts for industrial dehydrogenation processes.
