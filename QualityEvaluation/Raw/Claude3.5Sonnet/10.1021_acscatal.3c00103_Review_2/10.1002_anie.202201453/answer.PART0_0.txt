[1] "The modification of metal oxides by noble metals has been proved to be an effective strategy to improve the low reactivity of metal oxides in catalyzing PDH."

[2] "Researchers have proposed various regulatory mechanisms of noble metals on metal oxides. Gong and co-workers revealed that ZnO was promoted to be a stronger Lewis acid through the electron transfer from metal oxide to Pt, which attenuated the reduction of ZnO and enhanced the stability."

[3] "Kondratenko and co-workers suggested that low hydrogen adsorption energy barrier on Rh was favorable for H2 dissociation into H atoms and spillover onto the surface of ZrO2. Thus, the lattice oxygen was removed from ZrO2 to generate more coordinately unsaturated Zr4+ sites for PDH reaction."

[4] "With trace amounts (<0.15wt%) of noble metals, PDH reaction performance on zirconia can be enhanced prominently."

[5] "The low deactivation rate (kd=0.03h1) at 550C demonstrates its high stability"

Recent key strategies and approaches to enhance catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts in direct dehydrogenation processes include:

1. Modification of metal oxides with noble metals: This has been shown to improve the low reactivity of metal oxides in catalyzing propane dehydrogenation (PDH).

2. Promoting metal oxides to be stronger Lewis acids: For example, ZnO can be promoted through electron transfer from the metal oxide to Pt, which attenuates ZnO reduction and enhances stability.

3. Facilitating H2 dissociation and spillover: Noble metals like Rh can lower the hydrogen adsorption energy barrier, promoting H2 dissociation and spillover onto the oxide surface. This can remove lattice oxygen and generate more active sites.

4. Using trace amounts of noble metals: Even very small amounts (<0.15 wt%) of noble metals can significantly enhance PDH performance on supports like zirconia.

5. Optimizing metal-support interactions: The right combination of metal and support can lead to low deactivation rates and high stability, as demonstrated by some catalysts achieving low deactivation rates at high temperatures.

These advancements address challenges in catalyst design and performance optimization by enhancing activity, stability, and efficiency of PDH catalysts. They provide strategies to overcome limitations of pure metal oxide catalysts while minimizing the use of expensive noble metals, making them more suitable for industrial applications.

最近提高直接脱氢过程中负载金属催化剂催化稳定性的关键策略和方法包括：

1. 用贵金属修饰金属氧化物：这已被证明可以提高金属氧化物在催化丙烷脱氢（PDH）中的低反应活性。

2. 促进金属氧化物成为更强的路易斯酸：例如，通过从金属氧化物到铂的电子转移可以促进氧化锌，这减弱了氧化锌的还原并增强了稳定性。

3. 促进H2解离和溢出：像铑这样的贵金属可以降低氢吸附能垒，促进H2解离和溢出到氧化物表面。这可以除去晶格氧并产生更多活性位点。

4. 使用微量贵金属：即使非常少量（<0.15 wt%）的贵金属也能显著提高氧化锆等载体上的PDH性能。

5. 优化金属-载体相互作用：正确的金属和载体组合可以导致低失活率和高稳定性，一些催化剂在高温下表现出低失活率就证明了这一点。

这些进展通过提高PDH催化剂的活性、稳定性和效率，解决了催化剂设计和性能优化方面的挑战。它们提供了克服纯金属氧化物催化剂局限性的策略，同时最大限度地减少了昂贵贵金属的使用，使它们更适合工业应用。
