[1] "Alternatively, supported vanadium oxide is a promising catalyst compared with Pt and CrOx for its competitive performance, low cost and low toxicity."

[2] "The propane conversion and propylene selectivity exhibit little change during six cycles, implying outstanding regeneration stability."

[3] "We discovered that VOx/ZrO2, a well-known catalyst for ODH, has a much more superior PDH performance than commonly used VOx/Al2O3."

[4] "We propose the enhanced CH activation on VZr results from the facile reduction of VO, VOV and VOZr bonds, thus producing deeply reduced and lower coordinated V species."

The literature discusses several strategies to enhance the catalytic stability and performance of supported metal catalysts for direct dehydrogenation processes:

1. Using supported vanadium oxide as an alternative to Pt and CrOx catalysts, offering competitive performance with lower cost and toxicity.

2. Employing ZrO2 as a support for VOx instead of commonly used Al2O3, which significantly improves catalytic performance in propane dehydrogenation.

3. Facilitating the reduction of VO, VOV, and VOZr bonds through the interaction between VOx and ZrO2, resulting in deeply reduced and lower coordinated V species that enhance CH activation.

4. Optimizing the catalyst structure to achieve excellent regeneration stability, as demonstrated by the minimal changes in propane conversion and propylene selectivity over multiple reaction-regeneration cycles.

These advancements address challenges in catalyst design and performance optimization by improving activity, selectivity, and stability while reducing costs and environmental impact. The research provides new insights into developing high-performance VOx-based catalysts for industrial propane dehydrogenation applications.

该文献讨论了几种提高直接脱氢过程中负载金属催化剂催化稳定性和性能的策略：

1. 使用负载钒氧化物作为Pt和CrOx催化剂的替代品，提供具有竞争力的性能，同时降低成本和毒性。

2. 采用ZrO2作为VOx的载体，而不是常用的Al2O3，这显著提高了丙烷脱氢的催化性能。

3. 通过VOx和ZrO2之间的相互作用，促进VO、VOV和VOZr键的还原，产生深度还原和低配位的V物种，从而增强CH活化。

4. 优化催化剂结构以实现优异的再生稳定性，这通过多个反应-再生循环中丙烷转化率和丙烯选择性的微小变化得到证实。

这些进展通过提高活性、选择性和稳定性，同时降低成本和环境影响，解决了催化剂设计和性能优化方面的挑战。该研究为开发用于工业丙烷脱氢应用的高性能VOx基催化剂提供了新的见解。
