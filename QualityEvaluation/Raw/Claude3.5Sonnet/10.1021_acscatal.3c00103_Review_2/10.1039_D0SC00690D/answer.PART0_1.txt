[1] "In addition, we performed 120 min of the on stream reaction and studied the reactionregeneration cycles over 1VZr (Fig. S2b and S3). The propane conversion and propylene selectivity exhibit little change during six cycles, implying outstanding regeneration stability."

[2] "The facile reduction nature of VO bonds in the VZr catalyst can be interpreted by the lower electronegativity of Zr compared with Al, which causes the difference of the interaction between VOx and the support."

[3] "As more VO bonds are reduced in the VZr catalyst, we could deduce that lower coordinated V sites are more active for the CH activation."

The literature does not directly address comprehensive strategies for enhancing catalytic stability in direct dehydrogenation processes. However, it does provide some insights into a specific catalyst system that shows promising stability:

1. The use of ZrO2 as a support for VOx catalysts in propane dehydrogenation shows improved performance compared to traditional Al2O3 supports.

2. The VOx/ZrO2 catalyst exhibits excellent regeneration stability, with little change in propane conversion and propylene selectivity over six reaction-regeneration cycles.

3. The improved performance is attributed to the weaker interaction between VOx and ZrO2, which facilitates the reduction of VO bonds and creates more active, lower-coordinated V sites.

4. The lower electronegativity of Zr compared to Al plays a role in this enhanced reducibility and subsequent catalytic activity.

While these findings are specific to VOx catalysts for propane dehydrogenation, they suggest that careful selection of support materials and understanding of metal-support interactions can lead to more stable and active catalysts. This approach of tuning the electronic properties of the catalyst through support selection could potentially be applied more broadly to other metal catalysts and dehydrogenation processes.

虽然这篇文献并未直接讨论提高直接脱氢过程中催化剂稳定性的全面策略，但它确实为一个具有良好稳定性的特定催化剂系统提供了一些见解：

1. 在丙烷脱氢反应中，使用ZrO2作为VOx催化剂的载体比传统的Al2O3载体表现出更好的性能。

2. VOx/ZrO2催化剂表现出优异的再生稳定性，在六个反应-再生循环中，丙烷转化率和丙烯选择性几乎没有变化。

3. 性能的提升归因于VOx与ZrO2之间较弱的相互作用，这促进了VO键的还原，并创造了更多活性的、低配位的V位点。

4. 与Al相比，Zr较低的电负性在这种增强的可还原性和随后的催化活性中起到了重要作用。

虽然这些发现特定于用于丙烷脱氢的VOx催化剂，但它们表明，仔细选择载体材料并理解金属-载体相互作用可以带来更稳定和更活跃的催化剂。这种通过载体选择来调节催化剂电子性质的方法可能会更广泛地应用于其他金属催化剂和脱氢过程。
