[1] "The initial conversion of 1VZr is approximately five times higher than that of 1VAl and pure ZrO2, which shows a significant support effect."

[2] "The propane conversion and propylene selectivity exhibit little change during six cycles, implying outstanding regeneration stability."

[3] "We propose the enhanced CH activation on VZr results from the facile reduction of VO, VOV and VOZr bonds, thus producing deeply reduced and lower coordinated V species."

[4] "Considering the dramatic performance achieved through the interaction between VOx and ZrO2, our work provides a new insight into high-performance VOx-based catalysts for propane dehydrogenation."

The literature does not directly address recent strategies for enhancing catalytic stability in direct dehydrogenation processes. However, it does present some insights that could be relevant:

1. The use of ZrO2 as a support for VOx catalysts shows significant improvement in catalytic performance compared to Al2O3 support.

2. The VOx/ZrO2 catalyst demonstrates excellent regeneration stability over multiple reaction-regeneration cycles.

3. The enhanced performance is attributed to the facile reduction of VO, VOV, and VOZr bonds, which produces deeply reduced and lower coordinated V species.

4. The interaction between VOx and ZrO2 is key to achieving dramatic performance improvements.

While these findings don't directly answer the question about recent strategies for enhancing catalytic stability, they do provide insights into potential approaches for improving catalyst design and performance optimization. The use of appropriate support materials (like ZrO2) and understanding the interaction between the active metal and support could be crucial in developing more stable and efficient catalysts for industrial applications in direct dehydrogenation processes.

虽然文献没有直接讨论最近提高直接脱氢过程中催化剂稳定性的策略，但它确实提供了一些相关的见解：

1. 使用ZrO2作为VOx催化剂的载体比使用Al2O3载体显示出显著的催化性能改善。

2. VOx/ZrO2催化剂在多个反应-再生循环中表现出优异的再生稳定性。

3. 性能的提高归因于VO、VOV和VOZr键的容易还原，这产生了深度还原和低配位的V物种。

4. VOx和ZrO2之间的相互作用是实现显著性能改进的关键。

虽然这些发现没有直接回答关于最近提高催化稳定性策略的问题，但它们确实为改进催化剂设计和性能优化提供了见解。使用适当的载体材料（如ZrO2）并理解活性金属与载体之间的相互作用，可能对开发更稳定、更高效的直接脱氢过程工业应用催化剂至关重要。
