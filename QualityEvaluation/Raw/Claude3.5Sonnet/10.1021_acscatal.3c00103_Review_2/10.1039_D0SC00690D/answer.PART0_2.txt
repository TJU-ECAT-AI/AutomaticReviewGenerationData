[1] "It is generally accepted that the support could affect reactivity by stabilizing the active sites and/or altering the electron state of active sites."

[2] "We performed 120 min of the on stream reaction and studied the reactionregeneration cycles over 1VZr (Fig. S2b and S3). The propane conversion and propylene selectivity exhibit little change during six cycles, implying outstanding regeneration stability."

The literature does not directly address strategies for enhancing catalytic stability in direct dehydrogenation processes. However, it does mention some relevant aspects:

1. The support material can affect catalyst reactivity by stabilizing active sites and altering their electronic state.

2. The VOx/ZrO2 catalyst demonstrated good regeneration stability over multiple reaction-regeneration cycles, maintaining propane conversion and propylene selectivity.

3. The interaction between VOx and ZrO2 led to dramatically improved performance, suggesting that optimizing metal-support interactions could be a promising strategy for developing high-performance catalysts.

While the paper doesn't provide a comprehensive overview of recent developments in catalytic stability, it highlights the importance of metal-support interactions and demonstrates an example of a catalyst with good regeneration stability. Further research in this direction could potentially lead to more stable and efficient catalysts for industrial dehydrogenation processes.

该文献并未直接讨论提高直接脱氢过程中催化剂稳定性的策略。然而，它提到了一些相关方面：

1. 载体材料可以通过稳定活性位点和改变其电子态来影响催化剂的反应活性。

2. VOx/ZrO2催化剂在多个反应-再生循环中表现出良好的再生稳定性，保持了丙烷转化率和丙烯选择性。

3. VOx与ZrO2之间的相互作用导致性能显著改善，这表明优化金属-载体相互作用可能是开发高性能催化剂的一个有前景的策略。

虽然这篇论文没有全面概述催化稳定性的最新发展，但它强调了金属-载体相互作用的重要性，并展示了一个具有良好再生稳定性的催化剂例子。在这个方向上进行进一步研究可能会导致更稳定、更高效的工业脱氢过程催化剂。
