[1] "VOx/ZrO2, a well-known catalyst for ODH, has a much more superior PDH performance than commonly used VOx/Al2O3. The turnover frequency (TOF) is six times higher by loading VOx on ZrO2 than on Al2O3."

[2] "Combining H2-temperature programmed reduction, in situ Raman spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and theoretical studies, we find that the interaction between VOx and ZrO2 can facilitate the reduction of VO bonds, including VO, VOV and VOZr."

[3] "The promoting effect could be attributed to the formation of low coordinated V species in VOx/ZrO2 which is more active in CH activation."

[4] "We performed 120 min of the on stream reaction and studied the reaction–regeneration cycles over 1VZr (Fig. S2b and S3). The propane conversion and propylene selectivity exhibit little change during six cycles, implying outstanding regeneration stability."

The literature discusses several key strategies and approaches to enhance the catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts in direct dehydrogenation processes:

1. Support selection: Using ZrO2 as a support for VOx catalysts instead of commonly used Al2O3 dramatically improves catalytic performance. The VOx/ZrO2 catalyst shows six times higher turnover frequency compared to VOx/Al2O3.

2. Facilitating reduction of metal-oxygen bonds: The interaction between VOx and ZrO2 promotes the reduction of VO, VOV, and VOZr bonds. This leads to the formation of low-coordinated V species, which are more active in C-H activation.

3. Optimizing metal-support interactions: The weaker interaction between VOx and ZrO2 compared to VOx and Al2O3 allows for easier reduction of VO bonds, resulting in improved catalytic performance.

4. Regeneration stability: The VOx/ZrO2 catalyst demonstrates excellent regeneration stability, maintaining consistent propane conversion and propylene selectivity over multiple reaction-regeneration cycles.

These advancements address challenges in catalyst design and performance optimization by:

1. Improving activity and selectivity through careful selection of support materials.
2. Enhancing the formation of active sites through facilitated reduction of metal-oxygen bonds.
3. Optimizing metal-support interactions to achieve desired catalytic properties.
4. Ensuring long-term stability and regenerability of the catalyst for industrial applications.

While the literature doesn't explicitly discuss fabrication methods, these findings provide valuable insights for designing more efficient and stable catalysts for direct dehydrogenation processes in industrial applications.

该文献讨论了几种提高直接脱氢过程中负载金属催化剂催化稳定性的关键策略和方法：

1. 载体选择：使用ZrO2作为VOx催化剂的载体，而不是常用的Al2O3，大大提高了催化性能。VOx/ZrO2催化剂的转化频率比VOx/Al2O3高6倍。

2. 促进金属-氧键的还原：VOx与ZrO2之间的相互作用促进了VO、VOV和VOZr键的还原。这导致了低配位V物种的形成，它们在C-H活化中更活跃。

3. 优化金属-载体相互作用：与VOx和Al2O3相比，VOx和ZrO2之间较弱的相互作用允许VO键更容易还原，从而提高催化性能。

4. 再生稳定性：VOx/ZrO2催化剂表现出优异的再生稳定性，在多次反应-再生循环中保持稳定的丙烷转化率和丙烯选择性。

这些进展通过以下方式解决了催化剂设计和性能优化的挑战：

1. 通过仔细选择载体材料来提高活性和选择性。
2. 通过促进金属-氧键的还原来增强活性位点的形成。
3. 优化金属-载体相互作用以获得所需的催化性能。
4. 确保催化剂在工业应用中的长期稳定性和可再生性。

虽然文献没有明确讨论制造方法，但这些发现为设计更高效、更稳定的直接脱氢过程催化剂提供了宝贵的见解，可用于工业应用。
