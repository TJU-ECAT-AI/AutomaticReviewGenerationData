[1] "Ceria has wide applications in numerous catalytic processes, including CO oxidation, NOx reduction, and steam reforming. Owing to its high oxygen storage capacity (OSC), CeO2 tends to suppress coke formation using mobile oxygen released from the lattice to oxidize carbon deposits."

[2] "Doping metal cations into ceria is considered to be an effective way to regulate the structural and chemical properties of pure ceria."

[3] "The Ga addition markedly reduces the deactivation rate of catalyst and hence enhances the catalytic stability. The prominent impact of Ga addition is primarily attributed to the formation of PtGa alloys."

[4] "The influence of forming PtGa alloy on the catalytic performance could be attributed to a combination of geometric and electronic effects of metal promoter."

[5] "The enhanced reducibility of CeO2 is indicative of higher capability to eliminate the coke deposition and thus is beneficial to the improvement of catalytic stability."

Recent strategies to enhance catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts in direct dehydrogenation processes include:

1. Using ceria (CeO2) as a support material due to its high oxygen storage capacity, which helps suppress coke formation by oxidizing carbon deposits.

2. Doping metal cations into ceria to regulate its structural and chemical properties, enhancing its oxygen storage capacity and mobility.

3. Adding promoter metals like gallium (Ga) to form alloys with the active metal (e.g., PtGa alloys), which reduces catalyst deactivation rates.

4. Utilizing the geometric and electronic effects of metal promoters to modify catalyst performance. The geometric effect involves decreasing the size of metal ensembles or blocking low-coordinated defect sites, while the electronic effect lowers the desorption barrier of alkenes and coke precursors.

5. Enhancing the reducibility of the support material (e.g., CeO2) to improve its capability to eliminate coke deposition, thereby improving catalytic stability.

These advancements address challenges in catalyst design by focusing on suppressing coke formation, improving selectivity, and enhancing overall stability. They optimize performance for industrial applications by tailoring the catalyst composition and structure to resist deactivation and maintain high activity over extended periods.

最近提高直接脱氢过程中负载金属催化剂稳定性的策略包括：

1. 使用氧化铈(CeO2)作为载体材料，利用其高氧储存能力，通过氧化碳沉积物来抑制焦炭形成。

2. 将金属阳离子掺杂到氧化铈中，调节其结构和化学性质，提高其氧储存能力和移动性。

3. 添加促进剂金属如镓(Ga)，与活性金属形成合金(如PtGa合金)，减少催化剂失活速率。

4. 利用金属促进剂的几何和电子效应来改善催化剂性能。几何效应涉及减小金属集合体的尺寸或阻塞低配位缺陷位点，而电子效应降低烯烃和焦炭前体的脱附势垒。

5. 增强载体材料(如CeO2)的可还原性，提高其去除焦炭沉积的能力，从而提高催化稳定性。

这些进展通过专注于抑制焦炭形成、提高选择性和增强整体稳定性来解决催化剂设计中的挑战。它们通过调整催化剂组成和结构以抵抗失活并在长期内保持高活性，从而优化工业应用的性能。
