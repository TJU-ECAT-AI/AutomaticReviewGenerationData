[1] "Ceria has wide applications in numerous catalytic processes, including CO oxidation, NOx reduction, and steam reforming. Owing to its high oxygen storage capacity (OSC), CeO2 tends to suppress coke formation using mobile oxygen released from the lattice to oxidize carbon deposits."

[2] "We have presented an investigation into doping the Pt/CeO2-Al2O3 catalysts with Ga element to simultaneously enhance the redox property of CeO2 and modify the catalytic property of Pt nanoparticles."

[3] "The addition of Ga improves the catalytic performance of Pt catalysts in PDH, including increasing propylene selectivity and enhancing the catalytic stability."

[4] "The enhanced reducibility of CeO2 is indicative of higher capability to eliminate the coke deposition and thus is beneficial to the improvement of catalytic stability."

[5] "Simultaneously, the addition of Ga is prone to decorate Pt nanoparticles via the formation of PtGa alloys. The influence of forming PtGa alloys on the catalytic performance can be attributed to a combination of geometric and electronic effects."
