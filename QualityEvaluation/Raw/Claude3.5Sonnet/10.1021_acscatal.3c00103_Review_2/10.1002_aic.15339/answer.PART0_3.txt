[1] "Ceria has wide applications in numerous catalytic processes, including CO oxidation, NOx reduction, and steam reforming. Owing to its high oxygen storage capacity (OSC), CeO2 tends to suppress coke formation using mobile oxygen released from the lattice to oxidize carbon deposits."

[2] "Recently, gallium has also been considered to be an efficient promoter in Pt-based catalysts for alkane dehydrogenation to alkenes. In accordance with other metal promoters such as Sn, Cu, Zn, Re, and Ge, the introduction of Ga results in pronounced enhancement of dehydrogenation catalytic stability and selectivity toward desired products."

[3] "The influence of PtGa alloy on the catalytic performance could be attributed to the combination of geometric and electronic effects. The geometric effect contributes to decreasing the size of Pt ensembles or blocking the low-coordinated defect active sites by Ga atoms, thereby attenuating the structure-sensitive side reactions, including hydrogenolysis and deep dehydrogenation."

[4] "The electronic effect of the promoter is to lower the desorption barrier of alkene and coke precursors by donating electron to Pt atoms. As shown in Figure 9, the binding of surface intermediates becomes weaker along with the increase of Ga content in the alloy."

[5] "We have presented an investigation into doping the Pt/CeO2-Al2O3 catalysts with Ga element to simultaneously enhance the redox property of CeO2 and modify the catalytic property of Pt nanoparticles. The addition of Ga improves the catalytic performance of Pt catalysts in PDH, including increasing propylene selectivity and enhancing the catalytic stability."

Recent strategies to enhance catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts in direct dehydrogenation processes include:

1. Utilizing ceria (CeO2) as a support or component due to its high oxygen storage capacity, which helps suppress coke formation by oxidizing carbon deposits.

2. Introducing gallium as an efficient promoter for Pt-based catalysts, which enhances dehydrogenation catalytic stability and selectivity.

3. Forming PtGa alloys, which improves performance through geometric and electronic effects:
   - Geometric effect: Decreases Pt ensemble size or blocks low-coordinated defect sites, reducing side reactions.
   - Electronic effect: Lowers desorption barriers for alkenes and coke precursors, improving selectivity and stability.

4. Doping Pt/CeO2-Al2O3 catalysts with Ga to simultaneously enhance CeO2's redox properties and modify Pt nanoparticles' catalytic properties.

These advancements address challenges in catalyst design by:
- Improving coke resistance and catalyst longevity
- Enhancing selectivity towards desired products
- Optimizing metal-support interactions
- Tuning electronic properties of active sites

The combination of these strategies results in catalysts with improved stability, selectivity, and overall performance for industrial dehydrogenation applications.
