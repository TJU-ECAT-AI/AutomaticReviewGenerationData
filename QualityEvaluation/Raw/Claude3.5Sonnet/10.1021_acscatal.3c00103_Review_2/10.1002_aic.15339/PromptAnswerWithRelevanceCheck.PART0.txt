[1] "Ceria has wide applications in numerous catalytic processes, including CO oxidation, NOx reduction, and steam reforming. Owing to its high oxygen storage capacity (OSC), CeO2 tends to suppress coke formation using mobile oxygen released from the lattice to oxidize carbon deposits."

[2] "Doping metal cations into ceria is considered to be an effective way to regulate the structural and chemical properties of pure ceria."

[3] "The Ga addition markedly reduces the deactivation rate of catalyst and hence enhances the catalytic stability. The prominent impact of Ga addition is primarily attributed to the formation of PtGa alloys."

[4] "The influence of forming PtGa alloy on the catalytic performance could be attributed to a combination of geometric and electronic effects of metal promoter."

[5] "The enhanced reducibility of CeO2 is indicative of higher capability to eliminate the coke deposition and thus is beneficial to the improvement of catalytic stability."

Recent strategies to enhance catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts in direct dehydrogenation processes include:

1. Using ceria (CeO2) as a support material due to its high oxygen storage capacity, which helps suppress coke formation by oxidizing carbon deposits.

2. Doping metal cations into ceria to regulate its structural and chemical properties, enhancing its oxygen storage capacity and mobility.

3. Adding promoter metals like gallium (Ga) to form alloys with the active metal (e.g., PtGa alloys), which reduces catalyst deactivation rates.

4. Utilizing the geometric and electronic effects of metal promoters to modify catalyst performance. The geometric effect involves decreasing the size of metal ensembles or blocking low-coordinated defect sites, while the electronic effect lowers the desorption barrier of alkenes and coke precursors.

5. Enhancing the reducibility of the support material (e.g., CeO2) to improve its capability to eliminate coke deposition, thereby improving catalytic stability.

These advancements address challenges in catalyst design by focusing on suppressing coke formation, improving selectivity, and enhancing overall stability. They optimize performance for industrial applications by tailoring the catalyst composition and structure to resist deactivation and maintain high activity over extended periods.
