Recent advancements in enhancing the catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts for direct dehydrogenation processes include:

1. Doping with promoter elements: The study focuses on doping Pt/CeO2-Al2O3 catalysts with Ga to improve both the redox properties of CeO2 and the catalytic properties of Pt nanoparticles.

2. Enhancing redox properties: Ga doping increases the reducibility of CeO2, which helps eliminate coke deposition and improves catalytic stability.

3. Formation of alloys: The addition of Ga leads to the formation of PtGa alloys, which modifies the catalytic properties of Pt nanoparticles.

4. Geometric effects: The promoter element (Ga) decreases the size of Pt ensembles or blocks low-coordinated defect active sites, suppressing unwanted side reactions like hydrogenolysis and deep dehydrogenation.

5. Electronic effects: Ga donates electrons to Pt atoms, lowering the desorption barrier for alkenes and coke precursors. This hinders alkene adsorption on metal sites and reduces the likelihood of hydrogenolysis and coking.

These strategies address challenges in catalyst design by targeting multiple aspects of catalyst performance, including selectivity, stability, and resistance to coking. The combination of these approaches helps optimize catalyst performance for industrial applications by enhancing propylene selectivity and improving catalytic stability in propane dehydrogenation processes.
