[1] "Although supported Pt catalysts show high activity, the catalyst deactivation due to coke formation remains a challenging issue."

[2] "Besides the production of propylene, the activation of the CH bond in methane is also an important but challenging process."

[3] "Previous experimental studies have shown that the selectivity towards propylene during propane dehydrogenation on Pt particles can be increased by alloying late transition metals or main-group metals such as Cu and Sn."

[4] "DFT calculations indicate that at low coverage (1/9 ML), the conversion prefers a mechanism via two consecutive dehydrogenation steps to form CH2CH and then CH2C, with a final hydrogenation step to form CH3C."

[5] "The robustness against coking can be increased with additional promoters, such as late transition metals, main-group metals including Sn and Ga, alkali-metal oxides and rare-earth metal oxides."

Recent strategies to enhance catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts in direct dehydrogenation processes include:

1. Alloying with other metals: Adding metals like Cu or Sn to Pt catalysts has been shown to increase selectivity towards desired products like propylene and reduce coking.

2. Using promoters: Late transition metals, main-group metals (Sn, Ga), alkali-metal oxides, and rare-earth metal oxides can be added as promoters to increase resistance to coking.

3. Controlling reaction conditions: Optimizing parameters like coverage and temperature can influence the reaction mechanism and reduce unwanted side reactions.

4. Designing catalyst structure: Creating catalysts with specific surface structures or particle sizes can enhance stability and selectivity.

5. Understanding reaction mechanisms: Detailed computational studies of reaction pathways help identify rate-limiting steps and guide catalyst design.

These approaches address challenges in catalyst design by:
- Reducing coking and deactivation
- Improving selectivity towards desired products
- Enhancing catalyst longevity 
- Optimizing activity-selectivity trade-offs
- Providing fundamental insights to guide rational catalyst development

By combining theoretical studies with experimental work, researchers are developing more stable and selective catalysts for industrial dehydrogenation processes. However, challenges remain in translating these advances to large-scale applications while balancing performance, cost, and practicality.
