[1] "Although supported Pt catalysts show high activity, the catalyst deactivation due to coke formation remains a challenging issue."

[2] "Thus, the development of strategies to avoid coke formation is an important field of research. The robustness against coking can be increased with additional promoters, such as late transition metals, main-group metals including Sn and Ga, alkali-metal oxides and rare-earth metal oxides."

[3] "Previous experimental studies have shown that the selectivity towards propylene during propane dehydrogenation on Pt particles can be increased by alloying late transition metals or main-group metals such as Cu and Sn."

[4] "For example, Han et al. have shown that the selectivity towards propylene increases from <80% achieved on supported Pt catalyst to about 90% after Cu is added to Pt during the catalyst preparation. The PtCu catalyst inhibits the adsorption of formed propylene, and thus suppresses the secondary cracking reactions from propylene towards lighter hydrocarbons."

[5] "Indeed, DFT calculations have shown that the binding energy of propylene is weakened by at least 8 kJ mol1 after alloying different amounts of Sn in Pt(111). Meanwhile, all the dehydrogenation barriers shift up, including deep dehydrogenation from propylene."

Recent strategies to enhance the catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts in direct dehydrogenation processes focus on addressing the challenge of coke formation, which is a major cause of catalyst deactivation. Key approaches include:

1. Addition of promoters: Late transition metals, main-group metals (e.g., Sn and Ga), alkali-metal oxides, and rare-earth metal oxides are used to increase robustness against coking.

2. Alloying: Combining Pt with other metals like Cu or Sn has shown to improve selectivity towards desired products (e.g., propylene) and inhibit secondary reactions that lead to coke formation.

3. Modifying surface properties: Alloying changes the binding energy of intermediates and products on the catalyst surface. For example, adding Sn to Pt weakens propylene binding, which helps prevent further unwanted reactions.

4. Adjusting reaction barriers: Alloying also affects the energy barriers of various reactions. In the case of PtSn, it increases the barriers for dehydrogenation steps, including deep dehydrogenation that can lead to coke formation.

These advancements address challenges in catalyst design by tailoring the electronic and chemical properties of the catalyst surface. They improve fabrication processes by incorporating specific promoters or alloying elements. In terms of performance optimization, these strategies aim to balance activity and selectivity while minimizing deactivation, which is crucial for industrial applications where catalyst longevity and product yield are key economic factors.

最近提高直接脱氢过程中负载金属催化剂稳定性的策略主要集中在解决积碳形成这一导致催化剂失活的主要挑战上。主要方法包括：

1. 添加助剂：使用后过渡金属、主族金属（如Sn和Ga）、碱金属氧化物和稀土金属氧化物来增强抗积碳能力。

2. 合金化：将Pt与Cu或Sn等其他金属结合，已证明可以提高对目标产物（如丙烯）的选择性，并抑制导致积碳的次级反应。

3. 修改表面性质：合金化改变了催化剂表面对中间体和产物的结合能。例如，向Pt中添加Sn会减弱丙烯的结合，有助于防止进一步的不需要反应。

4. 调整反应能垒：合金化还会影响各种反应的能量障碍。在PtSn的情况下，它增加了脱氢步骤的能垒，包括可能导致积碳的深度脱氢。

这些进展通过调整催化剂表面的电子和化学性质来解决催化剂设计中的挑战。它们通过引入特定的助剂或合金元素改进了制造工艺。在性能优化方面，这些策略旨在平衡活性和选择性，同时最大限度地减少失活，这对于催化剂寿命和产品产率是关键经济因素的工业应用至关重要。
