[1] "Previous experimental studies have suggested both the single coordinated111 and the di-coordinated112 surface O atoms to be the active site of ODH of propane."

[2] "It is generally accepted that this catalytic process proceeds via a two-step mechanism:110 (1) reduction of the oxide surface by dehydrogenation of hydrocarbon and (2) re-oxidation of the surface by gas-phase O2."

[3] "Different approaches have been proposed to encounter the coking problem. It could be shown that the adsorption of C atoms on the closed packed surface of a NiAu surface alloy is thermodynamically less favoured, by 23 kJ mol1 or more, than the analogous process on a pure Ni(111) surface."

[4] "A cheaper alternative is to alloy Ni with Sn which hinders the CC bond formation and enhances the CO bond formation leading to the removal of surface C centers as carbon monoxide."

[5] "Since the step sites play an essential role in the growth of the graphene islands, as mentioned above, additives such as potassium,66 sulfur,66 gold66 or boron131 have been proposed.66 Computational calculations have shown that these elements tend to occupy the step sites and thus avoid the formation of graphene islands."

Recent strategies to enhance catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts in direct dehydrogenation processes include:

1. Alloying with other metals: Adding metals like Au or Sn to Ni catalysts can reduce carbon deposition and coking. NiAu alloys make C adsorption less favorable, while NiSn alloys hinder CC bond formation and promote CO bond formation to remove surface carbon.

2. Adding promoters: Elements like potassium, sulfur, gold or boron can occupy step sites on catalyst surfaces, preventing graphene island formation that leads to deactivation. 

3. Optimizing active sites: Identifying the most active and selective sites, such as specific coordinated oxygen atoms in oxide catalysts, allows for more targeted catalyst design.

4. Controlling reaction mechanism: Understanding the two-step mechanism of oxidative dehydrogenation on oxide catalysts enables better control of the reduction and re-oxidation steps.

5. Tuning electronic properties: Modifying the d-band center of metal catalysts through alloying or promoters can optimize binding strengths of intermediates and transition states.

These approaches aim to address challenges in catalyst design by reducing coking, improving selectivity, and prolonging catalyst lifetime for industrial applications. They demonstrate how fundamental mechanistic insights from computational and experimental studies can guide rational catalyst development.

最近提高直接脱氢过程中负载金属催化剂稳定性的策略包括：

1. 合金化：向镍催化剂中添加金或锡等金属可以减少碳沉积和结焦。镍-金合金使碳吸附不利，而镍-锡合金抑制碳-碳键形成并促进碳-氧键形成，从而去除表面碳。

2. 添加助剂：钾、硫、金或硼等元素可以占据催化剂表面的台阶位，防止导致失活的石墨烯岛形成。

3. 优化活性位点：识别最活跃和选择性的位点，如氧化物催化剂中特定配位的氧原子，允许更有针对性的催化剂设计。

4. 控制反应机理：了解氧化物催化剂上氧化脱氢的两步机理，能够更好地控制还原和再氧化步骤。

5. 调节电子性质：通过合金化或助剂修饰金属催化剂的d带中心，可以优化中间体和过渡态的结合强度。

这些方法旨在通过减少结焦、提高选择性和延长催化剂寿命来解决工业应用中催化剂设计的挑战。它们展示了计算和实验研究中获得的基本机理洞察如何指导合理的催化剂开发。
