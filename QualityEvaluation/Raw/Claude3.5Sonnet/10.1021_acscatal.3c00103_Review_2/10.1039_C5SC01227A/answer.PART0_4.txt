[1] "Previous experimental studies have shown102,103 that the selectivity towards propylene during propane dehydrogenation on Pt particles can be increased by alloying late transition metals or main-group metals such as Cu and Sn."

[2] "Indeed, DFT calculations104106 have shown that the binding energy of propylene is weakened by at least 8 kJ mol1 after alloying different amounts of Sn in Pt(111). Meanwhile, all the dehydrogenation barriers shift up (Fig. 12), including deep dehydrogenation from propylene."

[3] "Different approaches have been proposed to encounter the coking problem. It could be shown that the adsorption of C atoms on the closed packed surface of a NiAu surface alloy is thermodynamically less favoured, by 23 kJ mol1 or more, than the analogous process on a pure Ni(111) surface."

[4] "A cheaper alternative is to alloy Ni with Sn which hinders the CC bond formation and enhances the CO bond formation leading to the removal of surface C centers as carbon monoxide."

[5] "Since the step sites play an essential role in the growth of the graphene islands, as mentioned above, additives such as potassium,66 sulfur,66 gold66 or boron131 have been proposed.66 Computational calculations have shown that these elements tend to occupy the step sites and thus avoid the formation of graphene islands."

Recent strategies to enhance catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts in direct dehydrogenation processes include:

1. Alloying with late transition or main group metals: Adding metals like Cu or Sn to Pt catalysts increases selectivity towards propylene by weakening propylene binding and raising dehydrogenation barriers.

2. Preventing coke formation: NiAu alloys reduce carbon adsorption compared to pure Ni. NiSn alloys hinder CC bond formation and promote CO bond formation to remove surface carbon as CO.

3. Blocking step sites: Adding elements like potassium, sulfur, gold or boron occupies step sites on catalyst surfaces, preventing graphene island growth that leads to coking.

4. Tailoring subsurface composition: Adding elements like boron to subsurface sites can prevent carbon diffusion and carbide formation.

5. Optimizing reaction conditions: Controlling H2:alkane pressure ratios can balance dehydrogenation activity with coke formation.

These approaches aim to improve catalyst selectivity, prevent deactivation from coking, and optimize activity for industrial applications through careful design of catalyst composition and structure at the atomic level. The advancements address key challenges in maintaining long-term stability and desired product selectivity for commercial dehydrogenation processes.

最近提高直接脱氢过程中负载金属催化剂稳定性的策略包括：

1. 合金化与后过渡金属或主族金属：向铂催化剂中添加铜或锡等金属可以通过减弱丙烯的结合力和提高脱氢反应能垒来提高对丙烯的选择性。

2. 防止积碳形成：镍-金合金相比纯镍可以减少碳的吸附。镍-锡合金则可以抑制CC键的形成，并促进CO键的形成，从而将表面碳以一氧化碳的形式去除。

3. 阻塞台阶位点：添加钾、硫、金或硼等元素可以占据催化剂表面的台阶位点，从而防止导致积碳的石墨岛生长。

4. 调整亚表面组成：向亚表面位点添加硼等元素可以防止碳的扩散和碳化物的形成。

5. 优化反应条件：控制氢气与烷烃的压力比可以平衡脱氢活性和积碳形成。

这些方法旨在通过在原子水平上精心设计催化剂的组成和结构，来提高催化剂的选择性，防止因积碳而失活，并为工业应用优化活性。这些进展解决了商业脱氢过程中保持长期稳定性和所需产品选择性的关键挑战。
