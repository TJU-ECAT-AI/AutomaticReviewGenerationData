Recent strategies to enhance catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts for direct dehydrogenation include:

1. Adding promoters like late transition metals, main-group metals (Sn, Ga), alkali-metal oxides and rare-earth metal oxides to improve coking resistance.

2. Alloying Pt with metals like Cu and Sn to increase selectivity towards desired products like propylene.

3. Using alloying to weaken binding of products (e.g. propylene) and increase dehydrogenation barriers, which suppresses deep dehydrogenation and coking.

4. Incorporating elements that preferentially occupy step sites on catalyst surfaces to prevent formation of graphene-like coke deposits.

These approaches address challenges in catalyst design by modifying electronic and geometric properties to balance activity and stability. They optimize performance by suppressing undesired side reactions and coking while maintaining conversion of reactants. For industrial applications, these strategies can potentially extend catalyst lifetime and improve selectivity, addressing key issues in process economics and efficiency.

[1] "Previous experimental studies have suggested both the single coordinated111 and the di-coordinated112 surface O atoms to be the active site of ODH of propane."

[2] "It is generally accepted that this catalytic process proceeds via a two-step mechanism:110 (1) reduction of the oxide surface by dehydrogenation of hydrocarbon and (2) re-oxidation of the surface by gas-phase O2."

[3] "Different approaches have been proposed to encounter the coking problem. It could be shown that the adsorption of C atoms on the closed packed surface of a NiAu surface alloy is thermodynamically less favoured, by 23 kJ mol1 or more, than the analogous process on a pure Ni(111) surface."

[4] "A cheaper alternative is to alloy Ni with Sn which hinders the CC bond formation and enhances the CO bond formation leading to the removal of surface C centers as carbon monoxide."

[5] "Since the step sites play an essential role in the growth of the graphene islands, as mentioned above, additives such as potassium,66 sulfur,66 gold66 or boron131 have been proposed.66 Computational calculations have shown that these elements tend to occupy the step sites and thus avoid the formation of graphene islands."

[4] "For example, Han et al. have shown that the selectivity towards propylene increases from <80% achieved on supported Pt catalyst to about 90% after Cu is added to Pt during the catalyst preparation. The PtCu catalyst inhibits the adsorption of formed propylene, and thus suppresses the secondary cracking reactions from propylene towards lighter hydrocarbons."

Recent strategies to enhance the catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts in direct dehydrogenation processes focus on addressing the challenge of coke formation, which is a major cause of catalyst deactivation. Key approaches include:

1. Addition of promoters: Late transition metals, main-group metals (e.g., Sn and Ga), alkali-metal oxides, and rare-earth metal oxides are used to increase robustness against coking.

2. Alloying: Combining Pt with other metals like Cu or Sn has shown to improve selectivity towards desired products (e.g., propylene) and inhibit secondary reactions that lead to coke formation.

3. Modifying surface properties: Alloying changes the binding energy of intermediates and products on the catalyst surface. For example, adding Sn to Pt weakens propylene binding, which helps prevent further unwanted reactions.

4. Adjusting reaction barriers: Alloying also affects the energy barriers of various reactions. In the case of PtSn, it increases the barriers for dehydrogenation steps, including deep dehydrogenation that can lead to coke formation.

These advancements address challenges in catalyst design by tailoring the electronic and chemical properties of the catalyst surface. They improve fabrication processes by incorporating specific promoters or alloying elements. In terms of performance optimization, these strategies aim to balance activity and selectivity while minimizing deactivation, which is crucial for industrial applications where catalyst longevity and product yield are key economic factors.
