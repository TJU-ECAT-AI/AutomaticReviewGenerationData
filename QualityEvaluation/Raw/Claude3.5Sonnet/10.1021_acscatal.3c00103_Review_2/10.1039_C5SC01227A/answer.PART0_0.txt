[1] "Although supported Pt catalysts show high activity, the catalyst deactivation due to coke formation remains a challenging issue."

[2] "The robustness against coking can be increased with additional promoters, such as late transition metals, main-group metals including Sn and Ga, alkali-metal oxides and rare-earth metal oxides."

[3] "Previous experimental studies have shown that the selectivity towards propylene during propane dehydrogenation on Pt particles can be increased by alloying late transition metals or main-group metals such as Cu and Sn."

[4] "DFT calculations indicate that the binding energy of propylene is weakened by at least 8 kJ mol1 after alloying different amounts of Sn in Pt(111). Meanwhile, all the dehydrogenation barriers shift up, including deep dehydrogenation from propylene."

[5] "Calculations have shown that these elements tend to occupy the step sites and thus avoid the formation of graphene islands."

Recent strategies to enhance catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts for direct dehydrogenation include:

1. Adding promoters like late transition metals, main-group metals (Sn, Ga), alkali-metal oxides and rare-earth metal oxides to improve coking resistance.

2. Alloying Pt with metals like Cu and Sn to increase selectivity towards desired products like propylene.

3. Using alloying to weaken binding of products (e.g. propylene) and increase dehydrogenation barriers, which suppresses deep dehydrogenation and coking.

4. Incorporating elements that preferentially occupy step sites on catalyst surfaces to prevent formation of graphene-like coke deposits.

These approaches address challenges in catalyst design by modifying electronic and geometric properties to balance activity and stability. They optimize performance by suppressing undesired side reactions and coking while maintaining conversion of reactants. For industrial applications, these strategies can potentially extend catalyst lifetime and improve selectivity, addressing key issues in process economics and efficiency.

最近提高直接脱氢反应中负载金属催化剂稳定性的策略包括：

1. 添加后过渡金属、主族金属（Sn、Ga）、碱金属氧化物和稀土金属氧化物等助剂来提高抗结焦能力。

2. 将Pt与Cu和Sn等金属合金化，以提高对目标产物（如丙烯）的选择性。

3. 利用合金化减弱产物（如丙烯）的结合强度并增加脱氢反应势垒，从而抑制深度脱氢和结焦。

4. 引入优先占据催化剂表面台阶位的元素，以防止形成类石墨烯的积炭沉积。

这些方法通过调节电子和几何性质来平衡活性和稳定性，从而解决了催化剂设计中的挑战。它们通过抑制不良副反应和结焦，同时保持反应物转化来优化性能。对于工业应用，这些策略可能延长催化剂寿命并提高选择性，解决了工艺经济性和效率方面的关键问题。
