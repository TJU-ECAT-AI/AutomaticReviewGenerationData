[1] "Extensive research efforts have been made to inhibit deactivation and improve propene selectivity of Pt-based catalysts by doping promoters of Sn, In, Ga and Cu to form bimetallic catalysts."

[2] "Besides promoters, another method is to modify Al2O3 support with ZnO, La2O3 or TiO2 or replace Al2O3 support with ZnAl2O4, ZSM-5 or Mg(Al)O oxide."

[3] "Whether as promoters or supports, an important aim of using them is to obtain highly and stably dispersed Pt-based catalysts so that improving PDH performance."

[4] "Additionally, calcined HT-like compounds are regarded as a good way to obtained supported metal catalysts with high surface area and atomic-scale uniform distribution of metal species due to the topotactic transformation."

[5] "Given that the small Pt NPs and hierarchical microstructure may provide more stable and easily accessible active sites for PDH reaction, a promising design for obtaining the desired size of active Pt and hierarchical pore morphology was proposed."

Recent strategies to enhance catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts in direct dehydrogenation processes include:

1. Doping with promoters like Sn, In, Ga, and Cu to form bimetallic catalysts, which inhibits deactivation and improves propene selectivity.

2. Modifying or replacing traditional Al2O3 supports with materials like ZnO, La2O3, TiO2, ZnAl2O4, ZSM-5, or Mg(Al)O oxide.

3. Using calcined hydrotalcite-like compounds to achieve high surface area and atomic-scale uniform distribution of metal species.

4. Designing catalysts with small Pt nanoparticles and hierarchical microstructures to provide more stable and accessible active sites.

5. Focusing on achieving highly and stably dispersed Pt-based catalysts to improve performance in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions.

These advancements address challenges in catalyst design by targeting key issues such as metal sintering, carbon deposition, and propane cracking. They aim to optimize catalyst performance through improved metal dispersion, enhanced stability, and increased selectivity. The use of promoters and modified supports helps to create more robust catalysts that can withstand the harsh conditions of industrial dehydrogenation processes. Additionally, the development of hierarchical microstructures and controlled nanoparticle sizes allows for better control over catalytic properties, potentially leading to longer catalyst lifetimes and improved efficiency in industrial applications.
