[1] "Extensive research efforts have been made to inhibit deactivation and improve propene selectivity of Pt-based catalysts by doping promoters of Sn, In, Ga and Cu to form bimetallic catalysts."

[2] "Besides promoters, another method is to modify Al2O3 support with ZnO, La2O3 or TiO2 or replace Al2O3 support with ZnAl2O4, ZSM-5 or Mg(Al)O oxide."

[3] "Additionally, it has been verified that the single Pt atom sites on Pt-Sn/γ-Al2O3 with a sandwich structure are more favorable for PDH reaction than Pt ensembles."

[4] "Given that the small Pt NPs and hierarchical microstructure may provide more stable and easily accessible active sites for PDH reaction, a promising design for obtaining the desired size of active Pt and hierarchical pore morphology was proposed."

[5] "The promoted effects of HT reconstruction on the microstructure and morphology of the 3D oxide nanosheet array catalyst, and the subsequently superior PDH performance, were profoundly discussed."
