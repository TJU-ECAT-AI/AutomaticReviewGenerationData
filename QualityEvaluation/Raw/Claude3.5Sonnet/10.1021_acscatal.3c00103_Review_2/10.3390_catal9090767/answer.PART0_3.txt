[1] "Extensive research efforts have been made to inhibit deactivation and improve propene selectivity of Pt-based catalysts by doping promoters of Sn [9,10], In [11,12], Ga [13,14] and Cu [15] to form bimetallic catalysts."

[2] "Besides promoters, another method is to modify Al2O3 support with ZnO [19], La2O3 [20] or TiO2 [21] or replace Al2O3 support with ZnAl2O4 [22], ZSM-5 [23] or Mg(Al)O oxide [8,24]."

[3] "Additionally, it has been verified that the single Pt atom sites on Pt-Sn/γ-Al2O3 with a sandwich structure are more favorable for PDH reaction than Pt ensembles [25,26]."

[4] "Given that the small Pt NPs and hierarchical microstructure may provide more stable and easily accessible active sites for PDH reaction, a promising design for obtaining the desired size of active Pt and hierarchical pore morphology was proposed."

[5] "The ball-flower-like PtIn/Mg(Al)O catalyst exhibited high activity, excellent propene selectivity and superior durability as well as excellent resistance to the carbon deposition and Pt-sintering in the propane dehydrogenation to propene, which were mainly arising from its multi-level hierarchical microstructure with low specific surface area, and a large amount of strong and stable PtIn interactions."

Recent strategies to enhance catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts in direct dehydrogenation processes include:

1. Doping promoters like Sn, In, Ga, and Cu to form bimetallic catalysts, which inhibits deactivation and improves propene selectivity.

2. Modifying or replacing traditional Al2O3 supports with materials like ZnO, La2O3, TiO2, ZnAl2O4, ZSM-5, or Mg(Al)O oxide.

3. Developing single atom catalysts, such as single Pt atom sites on Pt-Sn/γ-Al2O3 with a sandwich structure, which show improved performance compared to Pt ensembles.

4. Designing catalysts with small metal nanoparticles and hierarchical microstructures to provide more stable and accessible active sites.

5. Creating multi-level hierarchical microstructures with low specific surface area and strong metal-support interactions, as demonstrated by the ball-flower-like PtIn/Mg(Al)O catalyst.

These advancements address challenges in catalyst design, fabrication, and performance optimization by:

1. Improving catalyst stability and resistance to deactivation.
2. Enhancing propene selectivity.
3. Reducing carbon deposition and metal sintering.
4. Optimizing metal dispersion and accessibility of active sites.
5. Strengthening metal-support interactions for improved durability.

These strategies contribute to the development of more efficient and long-lasting catalysts for industrial applications in direct dehydrogenation processes.

最近在直接脱氢过程中提高负载金属催化剂催化稳定性的策略包括：

1. 掺杂Sn、In、Ga和Cu等助剂形成双金属催化剂，抑制失活并提高丙烯选择性。

2. 用ZnO、La2O3、TiO2、ZnAl2O4、ZSM-5或Mg(Al)O氧化物等材料改性或替代传统的Al2O3载体。

3. 开发单原子催化剂，如具有三明治结构的Pt-Sn/γ-Al2O3上的单Pt原子位点，比Pt团簇表现更好。

4. 设计具有小金属纳米颗粒和分层微观结构的催化剂，提供更稳定和易接近的活性位点。
