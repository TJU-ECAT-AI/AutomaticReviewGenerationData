[1] "Extensive research efforts have been made to inhibit deactivation and improve propene selectivity of Pt-based catalysts by doping promoters of Sn [9,10], In [11,12], Ga [13,14] and Cu [15] to form bimetallic catalysts."

[2] "Besides promoters, another method is to modify Al2O3 support with ZnO [19], La2O3 [20] or TiO2 [21] or replace Al2O3 support with ZnAl2O4 [22], ZSM-5 [23] or Mg(Al)O oxide [8,24]."

[3] "Additionally, it has been verified that the single Pt atom sites on Pt-Sn/γ-Al2O3 with a sandwich structure are more favorable for PDH reaction than Pt ensembles [25,26]."

[4] "Given that the small Pt NPs and hierarchical microstructure may provide more stable and easily accessible active sites for PDH reaction, a promising design for obtaining the desired size of active Pt and hierarchical pore morphology was proposed."

[5] "The ball-flower-like PtIn/Mg(Al)O catalyst exhibited high activity, excellent propene selectivity and superior durability as well as excellent resistance to the carbon deposition and Pt-sintering in the propane dehydrogenation to propene, which were mainly arising from its multi-level hierarchical microstructure with low specific surface area, and a large amount of strong and stable PtIn interactions."

Recent strategies to enhance catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts in direct dehydrogenation processes include:

1. Doping promoters like Sn, In, Ga, and Cu to form bimetallic catalysts, improving deactivation resistance and propene selectivity.

2. Modifying or replacing traditional Al2O3 supports with alternatives like ZnO, La2O3, TiO2, ZnAl2O4, ZSM-5, or Mg(Al)O oxide.

3. Developing single atom catalysts, such as single Pt atom sites on Pt-Sn/γ-Al2O3 with a sandwich structure.

4. Creating hierarchical microstructures with small metal nanoparticles to provide stable and accessible active sites.

5. Designing catalysts with multi-level hierarchical microstructures and low specific surface areas, combined with strong metal-promoter interactions.

These advancements address challenges in catalyst design by improving resistance to deactivation, enhancing selectivity, and increasing durability. They optimize performance through better metal dispersion, stronger metal-support interactions, and tailored pore structures. For industrial applications, these strategies aim to create catalysts with longer lifetimes, higher yields, and improved resistance to carbon deposition and metal sintering.
