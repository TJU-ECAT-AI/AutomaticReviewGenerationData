[1] "Extensive research efforts have been made to inhibit deactivation and improve propene selectivity of Pt-based catalysts by doping promoters of Sn [9,10], In [11,12], Ga [13,14] and Cu [15] to form bimetallic catalysts."

[2] "Besides promoters, another method is to modify Al2O3 support with ZnO [19], La2O3 [20] or TiO2 [21] or replace Al2O3 support with ZnAl2O4 [22], ZSM-5 [23] or Mg(Al)O oxide [8,24]."

[3] "Additionally, it has been verified that the single Pt atom sites on Pt-Sn/γ-Al2O3 with a sandwich structure are more favorable for PDH reaction than Pt ensembles [25,26]."

[4] "In this paper, PtIn/Mg(Al)O catalyst in a flower-like nanosheet array (PtInHT-FR) was fabricated by reductionfollowed by calcination of the flower-like PtIn-HT precursor (PtInHT-F) with a hierarchical microstructure, which produced from a sodium dodecyl sulfate-assisted hydrothermal synthesis, followed by thermal decomposition and structural reconstruction."

[5] "The ball-flower-like PtIn/Mg(Al)O catalyst exhibited high activity, excellent propene selectivity and superior durability as well as excellent resistance to the carbon deposition and Pt-sintering in the propane dehydrogenation to propene, which were mainly arising from its multi-level hierarchical microstructure with low specific surface area, and a large amount of strong and stable PtIn interactions."

Recent strategies to enhance catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts in direct dehydrogenation processes include:

1. Doping promoters like Sn, In, Ga, and Cu to form bimetallic catalysts, which inhibits deactivation and improves propene selectivity.

2. Modifying or replacing traditional Al2O3 supports with materials like ZnO, La2O3, TiO2, ZnAl2O4, ZSM-5, or Mg(Al)O oxide.

3. Developing single atom catalysts, such as single Pt atom sites on Pt-Sn/γ-Al2O3 with a sandwich structure, which show improved performance compared to Pt ensembles.

4. Creating hierarchical microstructures, exemplified by the flower-like nanosheet array PtIn/Mg(Al)O catalyst, which is fabricated through a multi-step process involving hydrothermal synthesis, thermal decomposition, and structural reconstruction.

5. Optimizing catalyst design to achieve multi-level hierarchical microstructures with low specific surface area and strong, stable metal-support interactions.

These advancements address challenges in catalyst design, fabrication, and performance optimization by:

1. Improving catalyst durability and resistance to deactivation.
2. Enhancing propene selectivity and overall catalytic activity.
3. Reducing carbon deposition and metal sintering.
4. Optimizing metal dispersion and accessibility of active sites.
5. Tailoring support materials and morphologies for better catalyst performance.

These strategies contribute to the development of more efficient and stable catalysts for industrial applications in direct dehydrogenation processes.
