[1] "Extensive research efforts have been made to inhibit deactivation and improve propene selectivity of Pt-based catalysts by doping promoters of Sn, In, Ga and Cu to form bimetallic catalysts."

[2] "Besides promoters, another method is to modify Al2O3 support with ZnO, La2O3 or TiO2 or replace Al2O3 support with ZnAl2O4, ZSM-5 or Mg(Al)O oxide."

[3] "Additionally, it has been verified that the single Pt atom sites on Pt-Sn/γ-Al2O3 with a sandwich structure are more favorable for PDH reaction than Pt ensembles."

[4] "Given that the small Pt NPs and hierarchical microstructure may provide more stable and easily accessible active sites for PDH reaction, a promising design for obtaining the desired size of active Pt and hierarchical pore morphology was proposed."

[5] "The promoted effects of HT reconstruction on the microstructure and morphology of the 3D oxide nanosheet array catalyst, and the subsequently superior PDH performance, were profoundly discussed."

Recent key strategies to enhance catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts in direct dehydrogenation processes include:

1. Doping promoters like Sn, In, Ga, and Cu to form bimetallic catalysts, which helps inhibit deactivation and improve selectivity.

2. Modifying or replacing traditional Al2O3 supports with alternatives like ZnO, La2O3, TiO2, ZnAl2O4, ZSM-5, or Mg(Al)O oxide.

3. Developing single atom catalysts, such as single Pt atom sites on Pt-Sn/γ-Al2O3 with a sandwich structure, which have shown improved performance compared to Pt ensembles.

4. Designing catalysts with small metal nanoparticles and hierarchical microstructures to provide more stable and accessible active sites.

5. Utilizing hydrotalcite (HT) reconstruction to create 3D oxide nanosheet array catalysts with improved microstructure and morphology.

These advancements address challenges in catalyst design by focusing on improving metal dispersion, enhancing metal-support interactions, and creating more stable and selective active sites. The hierarchical structures and pore designs aim to optimize mass transfer and increase catalyst longevity. By combining these strategies, researchers are working towards developing more efficient and durable catalysts for industrial dehydrogenation processes.
