A combined in situ time-resolved UVVis, Raman and high-energy resolution X-ray absorption spectroscopy study on the deactivation behavior of Pt and PtSn propane dehydrogenation catalysts under industrial reaction conditions
Abstract
The catalytic performances of Pt/Al2O3 and PtSn/Al2O3 catalysts for the dehydrogenation of propane through consecutive reactionregeneration cycles have been studied under realistic reaction conditions. A 10-fold successive dehydrogenationregeneration cycling study, similar to that employed in an industrial propane dehydrogenation reactor, was performed in order to examine the catalyst activity and stability as well as the propene selectivity. Combined in situ UVVis/Raman spectroscopy measurements were taken in order to follow the coke formation processes during propane dehydrogenation. This approach allowed correlating propane conversion and propene formation with the on-line determined Raman D over G band intensity ratio and amount of coke formed. These in situ measurements on coke formation and related catalyst deactivation were supplemented by in situ high-energy resolution fluorescence detected (HERFD) XANES measurements in order to characterize the structural and electronic properties of the supported Pt and PtSn nanoparticles during the successive dehydrogenationregeneration cycles. This combination of powerful spectroscopic techniques revealed unique information regarding the activity behavior and deactivation mechanism of Pt- and PtSn-based propane dehydrogenation catalysts, enabling us to identify important structure-electronic-performance relationships as well as fundamental insight into the dynamics of PtSn alloy formation processes in Pt nanoparticles at elevated temperatures.

1. Introduction
The catalytic dehydrogenation of light alkanes, such as propane, is of great commercial interest due to the growing demand of propene as an important base chemical intermediate
[1]
,
[2]
,
[3]
,
[4]
. Pt-based catalysts have been widely used for alkane dehydrogenation reactions due to their excellent activity
[5]
. However, this catalyst system suffers from fast deactivation due to coke formation. There are several strategies to improve the catalytic behavior of Pt, including its promotion with a second metal
[6]
,
[7]
. Sn is often added to alter the product distribution for hydrocarbon conversion through the inhibition of hydrogenolysis, isomerisation, cracking and coke formation, thereby enhancing the catalyst selectivity and stability
[7]
,
[8]
. However, the mechanism by which Sn as promoter modifies the catalytic behavior of Pt remains a matter of debate due to the complicated nature of the PtSn alloy system. On the other hand, even though Sn is one of the most efficient promoters, deactivation due to coke formation is not avoidable and results in catalyst materials still exhibiting short lifetimes. As such, coked catalysts need to undergo a regeneration process (i.e., coke burning) in order to restore the activity. The regeneration treatment typically consists of exposing the coked catalyst to air or oxygen at high temperatures to burn the deposits, followed by a reduction step to bring back the active form of the catalyst (i.e., metallic Pt). Thus, it is important to consider that the exposure of the catalyst material to such oxidation and reduction cycles modifies the catalysts properties (both structural and electronic), which affects the behavior of the catalysts for subsequent dehydrogenation cycle(s). However, to the best of our knowledge, the majority of literature work mainly concentrates on the characterization of catalyst systems before and after only one dehydrogenation cycle; the study of Padro et al. in which multiple regeneration steps were employed is the only notable exception
[9]
. Therefore, unfortunately to date, it has not been possible to extract conclusive information regarding the basic principles of catalyst operation/deactivation of this important catalyst system under real reaction conditions.
In this work, the catalytic performance of Al2O3-supported Pt and PtSn catalysts has been investigated and compared for the selective dehydrogenation of propane to propene under industrially relevant conditions. The work makes use of two separate in situ reactor setups: one that utilizes a powder-containing, plug-flow reactor setup that combines on-line activity measurements with the simultaneous recording of in situ UVVis and Raman spectroscopy data and a second setup consisting of a flow-through cell using a pressed pellet sample that has been developed so that it is possible to perform catalytic reactions with on-line product monitoring at the outlet (mass spectrometer) while performing in situ high-energy resolution fluorescence detected (HERFD) X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) measurements
[10]
,
[11]
. The results obtained from these innovative real-time characterization studies show a difference in behavior for the catalyst materials (in the presence/absence of Sn as promoter) with regard to both propane dehydrogenation/activation and coke formation (in both the amount and type of coke formed). Differences in the oxidation state and the electronic properties and the local structures of Pt and Sn in PtSn catalysts during successive activationreactionregeneration cycles that affect the propane activation mechanism were also followed and have been correlated with the extent of alloy formation. In addition, we observed that during the regeneration process in oxygen to burn-off the formed coke on the catalyst, sintering or segregation of the metals also takes place, causing irreversible deactivation of the catalyst. Based on these new insights, a comprehensive working model for the short- and long-term deactivation of PtSn dehydrogenation catalysts is proposed.
2. Materials and methods
2.1. Catalyst preparation and physicochemical characterization
A series of Al2O3-supported Pt and PtSn (Pt: 0.5 wt.% and Sn: 1.5 wt.%) catalysts have been prepared. The proportion of both metals was chosen similar to that employed for PtSn-based industrial catalysts used in the dehydrogenation of propane in order to establish a close correspondence between the model and real systems. The catalyst materials have been synthesized making use of the incipient wet co-impregnation method of a commercial alumina carrier (Norton, 89 m2/g). Solutions containing the metal precursors were prepared containing 1.27 g H2PtCl6 (39.96% Pt; Degussa) and 2.91 g SnCl22H2O (Merck, p.a.) diluted in 600 ml ethanol 99.9%. Hundred grams of the carrier material was impregnated with the solution. The ethanol was then evaporated by using a rotavap (50 C, 20 mbar). The obtained catalyst materials were calcined for 3 h at 560 C. After propane dehydrogenation, the coke contents of a selection of catalyst samples have been determined using thermogravimetrical analysis in artificial air using a Perkin-Elmer Pyris 1 TGA instrument.
2.2. In situ X-ray absorption spectroscopy
Experiments at the Sn K edge and Pt L3 edge during H2 reduction were conducted using an in situ cell, which allows the investigation of the catalyst materials using X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) for sample temperatures from 25 to 500 C. This was integrated with a gas flow system in order to switch between different gas atmospheres. EXAFS measurements were taken at the DUBBLE (BM26A) beamline of the European Synchrotron Research Facility (ESRF, Grenoble, France). The beamline was equipped with a double Si(1 1 1) crystal monochromator. Measurements were taken in fluorescence mode using a 9-element germanium detector. The samples were prepared by hand pressing 0.1 g of powder into a self-supporting wafer. This wafer was then placed in a treatment cell and reduced in a flow of 10% H2 in He for 30 min at 450 C, the temperature ramp-up rate being 5 C/min. Afterward, the cell was cooled down and Pt L3 edge EXAFS scans were acquired at liquid N2 temperature. Each measurement was repeated two times. The EXAFS data analysis was carried out with the EXCURV program. The EXAFS data were extracted from the averaged absorption spectra through pre-edge subtraction using a modified Victoreen curve and then through background subtraction employing cubic spline routines with a continuously adjustable smoothing factor. Finally, the average spectrum was normalized by dividing the data by the absorption intensity at 50 eV after the edge. The obtained chi (χ) function was analyzed by multiple shells data fitting in k-space with a k3-weighting. From the EXAFS analysis, the obtained first-shell PtPt coordination numbers were used to evaluate the average Pt particle size.
2.3. Model calculations for ideal Pt and PtSn nanoparticle geometries
In order to extract particle morphology/bimetal distribution information from the XAFS results, we performed a series of numerical simulations to determine coordination numbers for the first two coordination (Pt and Sn) shells, for different theoretical bimetal particle morphologies. Details on these calculations can be found elsewhere
[12]
. Bimetal structures were created using the nanocluster building function of the Materials Studio software package based on a Pt unit cell and substituting some Pt atoms for Sn. Various structures were simulated with differing bimetal arrangements including spherical, hemispherical and cubic structures with decorated, coreshell, hemi-sphere and random alloy distributions. The final structures proposed were based on fits (coordination number variability of 0.1) to the obtained coordination numbers from the experimental EXAFS analysis.
2.4. CO temperature-programmed desorption infrared spectroscopy
Infrared (IR) measurements were taken on self-supporting catalyst wafers (ϕ = 7 mm) that were pressed from 0.01 g to 0.02 g of sample material. A pressure of no more than 2 bar was applied during a period of 10 s to prevent the destruction of the pore structure of the support. The wafer was placed in an IR transmission cell equipped with CaF2 windows. The cell was connected to a gas handling system, which allowed measurements under low pressure (106 bar) as well as under gas flow. The cell was evacuated to 106 bar at 50 C for 30 min prior to reduction by 60 ml/min flow of H2 (quality 5.0; Hoekloos). During reduction, the temperature was raised from 50 C to 450 C at 3 C/min and maintained for 30 min at 450 C. The system was then switched back to vacuum for 30 min at 450 C, before being cooled down to 50 C at a rate of 3 C/min. A first spectrum was taken under vacuum and served as background reference for the catalyst wafer. Next, 10% CO (quality 4.7; Linde AG) in He (quality 4.6; Linde AG) was introduced in the cell until a stable pressure of ca. 0.06 bar was reached. After 30 min of static CO exposure, the cell was evacuated to a pressure of 2 × 106 bar for 30 min at 50 C before Temperature-programmed desorption (TPD) was started by increasing the temperature up to 450 C at a rate of 3 C/min. IR spectra were recorded every 2 min on a Perkin-Elmer 2000 FT-IR instrument with an optical resolution of 4 cm1 and an accumulation of 25 scans with wavenumbers ranging from 4000 cm1 to 1300 cm1. The data acquisition was performed automatically using the Perkin-Elmer Time-Base software. The reproducibility of all IR-TPD measurements was verified by repeating the experiments in two different ways: (1) On two different wafers from the same sample and (2) on the same wafer by applying the same procedure two times in a row without opening the IR cell. Band positions and corresponding area data were estimated from the baseline-corrected spectra using the Perkin-Elmer Time-Base software package.
2.5. Catalytic activity and coke formation measurements
The catalytic activity testing was carried out in an in situ combined UVVis/Raman setup with on-line gas chromatography (GC) analysis. Details of this experimental setup can be found elsewhere
[11]
. A cylindrical quartz reactor with a square section which was made out of optical grade quartz windows was placed in an oven; the optical grade windows allow for the collection of high-quality Raman and UVVis data. A Kaiser Optical Systems Inc. Raman spectrometer was placed on one side of the reactor. Spectra were recorded in Holograms 4.0 with an exposure time of 7 s and 11 accumulations. On the other side of the reactor, a high-temperature UVVis probe was positioned detecting every 2 min (5 s, 10 accumulations) in situ UVVis spectra. Since the reflectance properties of the catalyst material (i.e., catalyst darkening) changed during the reaction due to the formation of coke on the catalyst, a correction on the observed Raman intensity was made by UVVis. Details of this procedure can be found elsewhere
[13]
; 0.5 g of catalyst was placed in the reactor as packed bed on quartz wool. A variable gas feed was introduced in the reactor. The quantification of the gas products was possible by an on-line Interscience compact GC equipped with two detectors, namely a FID and TCD with a Porabond-Q and a Carboxan column, respectively. At the outlet of the reactor, the gas stream was diluted with He for GC analysis. Chromatograms were acquired every 5 min. Different conditions were employed for the activity measurements:
(a)
Pre-treatment: The samples were pre-activated in the same reactor before C3H8 dehydrogenation reaction was carried out. A H2 flow (9.5 ml min1) was introduced, while the temperature was increased from room temperature up to 590 C with a temperature ramp of 10 C min1. After the reduction, the reactor was purged with He for 5 min.
(b)
Dehydrogenation reaction: After reduction, a gas stream of pure propane (9 ml min1) humidified with 9 v/v% of steam was introduced in the reactor. The reaction proceeded for 6 h at 590 C, and after this treatment, the system was purged with He for 5 min.
(c)
Regeneration process: The sample was regenerated at the same temperature in an oxygen environment to burn the coke from the catalyst material. The regeneration process consisted of a moderate reoxidation in 7% of O2 for 1 h and a more severe reoxidation in 20% of O2 at 590 C. After this time, no CO2 was detected in the GC, which suggests that the burn-off of the coke was complete. The system was purged with He for 5 min.
(d)
Re-activation of the catalyst: Without modifying the temperature, a reduction step was first performed to activate the catalyst material. This time a gas flow of 20% of H2 in He was used. After a He purge, the dehydrogenation reaction was started again and considered as a new cycle. This cycle was repeated 10 times and after the reactor was cooled down in He to RT.
2.6. In situ high-energy resolution fluorescence detected X-ray absorption spectroscopy
Measurements were taken at the ID26 beamline of ESRF (Grenoble, France). High-energy resolution fluorescence detected (HERFD) X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) at the L3 (11.5637 keV) edges was performed on the Pt/Al2O3 and PtSn/Al2O3 catalysts under the same gas conditions and reaction temperatures as discussed above for the combined in situ UVVis/Raman spectroscopy measurements. For these HERFD-XAS measurements, we used the horizontal plane Rowland circle spectrometer tuned to the Pt Lα1 (9.442 eV) fluorescence line. The (660) Bragg reflection of four spherically bent Ge wafers with R = 1 m and a diameter of 89 mm was required. Approximately, 40 mg of catalyst was pressed to a self-supporting wafer, which fits in the sample holder.
An in situ cell provided by the Sample Environment Support Service (SESS) of the ESRF was used. It is specially designed for the use of pelleted samples and allows for the measurement of fluorescence data
[10]
. The maximum working temperature can go up to 1000 C. The gas cell included cooling loops, thermal couples and heaters all built-in. It was also equipped with a gas flow control (from the ID26 ESRF beamline) to use different gas atmosphere. The experimental runs consist of an in situ pre-reduction at 600 C (20% H2/He) followed by continuous propane dehydrogenation (10% C3H8/He) until the temperature reaches 600 C. Then, subsequent step changes in the gas mixture under isothermal conditions were applied; i.e., cycles of propane dehydrogenation (10% C3H8/He), regeneration in O2 atmosphere and re-reduction in H2, similar to the catalytic study described above. An on-line mass spectrometer provided a measure of the global catalytic process at hand through monitoring the composition of the gaseous feedstock, ensuring reproduction, on the ESRF beamline of a reaction environment and of catalytic performances similar to those present in the in situ UVVis/Raman setup described above.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Catalytic activity studies of supported Pt and PtSn nanoparticles
Fig. 1
shows an overview of the catalytic performances of the Pt and PtSn/Al2O3 catalyst materials during 10 successive dehydrogenationregeneration cycles. Although the fresh Pt/Al2O3 catalyst exhibits the highest initial reaction activity, after 6 h of reaction, the catalyst deactivates very fast with propane conversions decreasing from 40% to 5%. After this first reaction and subsequent isothermal regeneration process, the catalytic activity is observed to be much lower during the second and third reaction cycles, resulting in almost no net conversion after three dehydrogenationregeneration cycles.

In contrast, the presence of Sn as a promoter drastically improves the catalytic behavior. The PtSn/Al2O3 catalyst material possesses both a higher propane conversion and propene selectivity, which is maintained throughout the duration of the first dehydrogenation step. As with the Pt/Al2O3 catalyst, a decrease in the catalytic activity is also observed after the first regeneration treatment. However, this happens more gradually than for the Pt/Al2O3 catalyst. Further deactivation occurs during subsequent dehydrogenationregeneration cycles although a steady state is reached after 56 cycles. Interestingly, despite this gradual catalyst deactivation, the net conversion during the experiment is always higher for the PtSn/Al2O3 catalyst than for the Pt/Al2O3 catalyst. This is illustrated in
Fig. 1
A.
The corresponding propene selectivities of the Pt/Al2O3 and PtSn/Al2O3 catalysts are shown in
Fig. 1
B. It is clear that for the fresh Pt/Al2O3 catalyst, the propene selectivity decreases with reaction time. However, in contrast, the PtSn/Al2O3 catalyst not only shows higher overall propene selectivity, but also the selectivity increases gradually throughout the experiment. After the first regeneration process, the PtSn/Al2O3 catalyst still presents high selectivity, which remains constant during the cycle. Nevertheless, for the following dehydrogenation cycles, a decrease in selectivity was observed during the reaction time which became more acute after 56 cycles. The hydrocarbon distribution for the Pt/Al2O3 and PtSn/Al2O3 catalysts during the multiple reaction cycles is given in
Fig. S1
, indicating that besides propene also ethane, ethene and some methane are formed.
3.2. Analysis of coke deposit formation and its relation to catalyst performance
The amount of coke deposited on the catalyst materials after propane dehydrogenation for 6 h was measured by using thermogravimetrical analysis. The amount of coke on the Pt/Al2O3 and PtSn/Al2O3 catalysts was 8.2 and 7.3% w/w, respectively. The formation of coke on a PtSn/Al2O3 catalyst was only a bit lower than on a Pt/Al2O3 catalyst; however, the influence on the propane dehydrogenation activity and propene selectivity appears to be much more significant and merited a more detailed spectroscopic investigation of the coke formed.
As a result, we have on-line monitored the formation of coke during propane dehydrogenation using a combined in situ UVVis/Raman setup. The in situ UVVis spectra were used to perform a correction of the decrease in the Raman signal caused by the darkening of the catalyst as coke deposits gradually formed on the catalyst surface. Detailed information about this procedure can be found elsewhere
[13]
, and the coke amount from the TGA analysis was used to quantify the in situ Raman data. As an example,
Fig. 2
shows the raw in situ Raman spectra for the Pt/Al2O3 catalyst during the first propane dehydrogenation cycle measured at 590 C.

Fig. 2. In situ Raman spectra of the Pt/Al2O3 catalyst acquired along the first dehydrogenation of propane cycle for 6 h at 590 C.
Two distinct Raman bands at around 1584 and 1321 cm1 were observed. These Raman bands can be ascribed to coke G and D modes, respectively. Single crystal graphite has a single Raman active mode, (the zone-center mode) at 1580 cm1 of E2g symmetry and is labeled G for graphite. Disordered graphite has a second mode around 1350 cm1 of A1g symmetry labeled D for disorder. It corresponds to a breathing vibration of rings at the K zone boundary
[14]
,
[15]
. An unusual and significant fact is that the Raman spectra of most disordered carbons remain dominated by these two G and D modes of graphite, even when the carbons do not have a particular graphitic ordering
[16]
. The G mode is actually the stretching vibration of any pair of sp2 sites, whether in CC chains or in aromatic rings
[16]
. This mode is then also seen in ethylene as well as in graphite but is blue-shifted to higher wavenumbers. Thus, G in this instance does not only mean graphite. The D mode is the breathing mode of those sp2 sites only in rings, not in chains. Therefore, these bands provide information not only on the amount of coke present on the catalyst, but also on its nature. Ferrari and Robertson
[16]
found that it is possible to classify the Raman spectra of carbons, using the intensity ratio of the D and G bands, within a three-stage model of disorder degree as follows: (1) sp3 amorphous carbons (a-C) to sp2 a-C, (2) a-C sp2 to nano-crystalline graphite and (3) nano-crystalline graphite to more perfect graphite.
The Raman intensity profile of the coke band located at 1584 cm1 after UVVis correction is shown in
Fig. S2
. It was noted that the amount of coke in the Pt/Al2O3 and PtSn/Al2O3 catalysts gradually increases during propane dehydrogenation, but after regeneration treatment the total amount of coke decreases in the successive cycles. This behavior parallels the propane conversion profiles. For the PtSn/Al2O3 catalyst, the presence of Sn not only reduces the amount of coke formed during a propane dehydrogenation run but also modifies its rate of formation.
The intensity ratio of the D and G Raman bands at around 1321 and 1584 cm1, respectively, provides information on the type of coke that is formed on the surface. The results are displayed in
Fig. 3
for cycle 1, 2 and 10, together with the activity data for the Pt/Al2O3 and PtSn/Al2O3 catalysts. For Pt/Al2O3, an initial D over G ratio of 0.4 is observed. This ratio increases with time on stream until reaching a value of around 1 where it remains constant even after one hour of reaction. These results suggest that at the beginning of the catalytic reaction, a more disordered aliphatic type of coke forms and after 1 h the amount of coke increases but without changing its nature. A similar trend is observed in the following additional propane dehydrogenation cycles. In the case of the PtSn/Al2O3 catalyst, the initial D over G ratio is around 0.7 and remains almost constant during the cycle, indicating that no changes take place in the nature of the coke. However, after the first regeneration process, the coke formed at the beginning of the next dehydrogenation cycle seems more disordered and with reaction time, the D over G ratio first increases, but after one hour-on-stream the D over G ratio decreases. This indicates that the nature of coke becomes more graphitic; the propene would initially form oligomers (or polymers) and aromatics, but after a while, these surface species would lose hydrogen and become more graphitic.
Fig. 3
also shows that the change in the nature of the coke deposits coincides with a maximum in propane conversion. Apparently, then the type of coke influences the activity of the propane dehydrogenation reaction. In the 10th dehydrogenation cycle, the same behavior is observed showing a clear relation between the deactivation of the catalyst material and the formation of more graphitic coke.

The Pt/Al2O3 catalyst exhibits a higher initial propane conversion than the PtSn/Al2O3 catalyst. However, the initial selectivity to propene is much lower (60%) when compared to the PtSn/Al2O3 catalyst (90%) (
Fig. 1
B). The high selectivity toward cracking products, namely methane and ethane, for the Pt/Al2O3 catalyst, as illustrated in
Fig. S1
, indicates that the supported Pt nanoparticles in this catalyst are very active for CC bond activation
[17]
,
[18]
,
[19]
. From the above observation, it can be suggested that a reaction mechanism involving common surface intermediates, which form activated/partly dehydrogenated propane, can either desorb as C3H6 or further undergo cracking to C1, C2 and even to surface carbon deposits. The fast decrease in conversion points to a rapid deactivation of the catalyst probably caused by the blocking of active Pt sites by coke formation.
During the first dehydrogenation cycle, the PtSn/Al2O3 catalyst shows lower initial propane conversion and a higher rate of coke formation when compared to the Pt/Al2O3 catalyst. In the presence of Sn, the light products that are produced are ethane and methane in equimolar amounts, which is typical for a metal-catalyzed hydrogenolysis reaction (
Fig. S1
). The selectivity to light products is much lower and decreases with time, suggesting that the hydrogenolysis reaction is inhibited by coke formation on the metal particles
[7]
. However, despite the amount of coke formed, PtSn/Al2O3 exhibits a much higher selectivity to propene and the amount of propene increases together with propane conversion with time on stream, displaying better catalyst stability than the Pt/Al2O3 catalyst.
The results indicate that the presence of Sn not only modifies the electronic properties of the Pt nanoparticles and therefore the activation of propane but also produces a drain-off effect. This drain-off effect keeps the Pt sites clean by removing the coke precursors from the vicinity of active sites to the support. This hypothesis was first proposed by Lieske et al. and has been discussed in the context of a particle ensemble effect
[20]
. It suggests that coke precursors such as olefinic species adsorb less strongly on the PtSn bimetallic catalyst due to an ensemble effect of Sn. Therefore, coke precursors are mobile and easily migrate to the support where they finally deposit as coke. In recent work, Kumar et al.
[21]
proposed a modified drain-off effect, which is based on a combination of the electronic and drain-off effects. After one regeneration process, although the Pt/Al2O3 catalyst exhibits lower propane conversion, the same catalytic behavior and coke evolution is observed. On the other hand, the PtSn/Al2O3 catalyst material possesses both different activity and different coke formation with respect to the initial dehydrogenation cycle, which suggests a modification of the properties of the active sites.
3.3. Electronic and structural characterization of Pt and PtSn nanoparticles
3.3.1. XANES-EXAFS analysis
The normalized L3 XANES spectra obtained for the Pt/Al2O3 catalyst after H2 reduction display a characteristic Pt(0) spectrum with the same edge position as a Pt foil reference. However, while the spectrum shape of the PtSn/Al2O3 catalyst also resembles that of the Pt foil, the absorption edge is shifted to higher energy (
Fig. S3
). This points to a clear electronic interaction between the Sn and Pt and in particular that Sn withdraws electron density from Pt. Also a clear red shift is visible for the 5f Continuum Resonance (CR), located at ca. 11,592 eV, with respect to the Pt/Al2O3 sample (
Fig. S3
). This red shift indicates an increase in the PtPt nearest distance most likely associated with the dissolution of Sn atoms in the Pt fcc structure and the incipient formation of an alloy phase
[22]
.
The Sn K edge was also measured during H2 treatment. XANES analysis shows that Sn is presented initially as SnO2 and reduction to SnO takes place during the ramp of temperature in H2 (
Fig. S4
). From Pt XAS results, it is clear that an interaction between both metals exists and PtSn alloy formation is detected. However, it is not possible to extract the same conclusions from Sn K edge data, as X-ray absorption is a bulk technique and there are three times more Sn than Pt in the sample and EXAFS results for Pt indicates that only a small fraction of Sn comes into the alloy. Therefore, it is not possible to distinguish this phenomenon of alloy formation in the data from Sn K edge as for the most part SnO is detected.
