[1] "Adding a promoter such as tin, which dilutes the platinum surface, is a commonly used strategy to boost the platinum catalyst efficiency in the industrial dehydrogenation reaction."

[2] "Further improvement in the platinum utilization efficiency can be achieved by preparing small-sized clusters or even single-atom catalysts using various methods."

[3] "The geometry of the Pt/Cu cluster together with the metallic platinum ensemble stabilized on the top layer of the copper cluster is verified to be responsible for the improvement in the catalytic efficiency."

[4] "The strong bonding interaction between copper and edge BO defects maintained low-crystallized cluster geometry, accordingly promoting both the dispersion and stability of catalytically active species, while the small platinum ensembles stabilized on the top layer of the copper cluster provided accessible platinum ensembles in the metallic state, which are recognized as ideal dehydrogenation sites."

[5] "Different from other supports, h-BN-sheet provides abundant stacking fault edges terminating with the BO defects. These BO defects include unpaired electrons, which can strongly interact with metal active species; meanwhile, the high affinity of the BO defects for electrons helps strengthen the interaction between the metal and support."

Recent strategies to enhance the catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts in direct dehydrogenation processes include:

1. Adding promoters like tin to dilute the platinum surface, improving catalyst efficiency.

2. Preparing small-sized clusters or single-atom catalysts to increase platinum utilization efficiency.

3. Using bimetallic systems, such as Pt/Cu clusters, where the geometry and electronic state are optimized for improved catalytic performance.

4. Employing supports with unique properties, like h-BN nanosheets, which provide strong bonding interactions with metal species.

5. Utilizing supports with abundant defect sites, such as BO defects in h-BN, which can strongly interact with and stabilize metal active species.
