          [1] "Adding a promoter such as tin, which dilutes the platinum surface, is a commonly used strategy to boost the platinum catalyst efficiency in the industrial dehydrogenation reaction."

[2] "Further improvement in the platinum utilization efficiency can be achieved by preparing small-sized clusters or even single-atom catalysts using various methods."

[3] "The geometry of the Pt/Cu cluster together with the metallic platinum ensemble stabilized on the top layer of the copper cluster is verified to be responsible for the improvement in the catalytic efficiency."

[4] "The strong bonding interaction between copper and edge BO defects maintained low-crystallized cluster geometry, accordingly promoting both the dispersion and stability of catalytically active species, while the small platinum ensembles stabilized on the top layer of the copper cluster provided accessible platinum ensembles in the metallic state, which are recognized as ideal dehydrogenation sites."

[5] "Different from other supports, h-BN-sheet provides abundant stacking fault edges terminating with the BO defects. These BO defects include unpaired electrons, which can strongly interact with metal active species; meanwhile, the high affinity of the BO defects for electrons helps strengthen the interaction between the metal and support."

[6] "The unique strong bonding interaction between copper and the edge BO defects integrated with metallic platinum ensembles stabilized on the top layer of the copper clusters is the crucial factor that determines the catalytic performance of the Pt/Cu/h-BN-sheet catalyst in the dehydrogenation of propane."

[7] "Herein, we report that a Pt/Cu cluster catalyst containing 100 ppm platinum using hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) nanosheets as a support significantly promotes the catalytic activity (>7 molC3H6 molPt1 s1, 520 C) for the dehydrogenation of propane to propylene."

          Recent strategies and approaches to enhance the catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts in direct dehydrogenation processes include:

1. Adding promoters like tin to dilute the platinum surface, improving catalyst efficiency.

2. Preparing small-sized clusters or single-atom catalysts to increase platinum utilization efficiency.

3. Designing bimetallic clusters (e.g., Pt/Cu) with specific geometries, where platinum ensembles are stabilized on top of copper clusters.

4. Using supports with unique properties, such as hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) nanosheets, which provide abundant edge defects (BO) that strongly interact with metal species.

5. Leveraging strong metal-support interactions to maintain low-crystallized cluster geometry, promoting dispersion and stability of active species.

6. Integrating the strong bonding interaction between copper and support defects with metallic platinum ensembles on top of copper clusters.

These advancements address challenges in catalyst design, fabrication, and performance optimization for industrial applications by:

1. Maximizing catalytic activity while minimizing platinum usage.
2. Improving catalyst stability through strong metal-support interactions.
3. Enhancing selectivity and activity by optimizing the geometry and electronic structure of active sites.
4. Developing supports that can better disperse and stabilize metal clusters.
5. Creating ideal dehydrogenation sites through careful control of catalyst geometry and composition.
6. Enabling lower reaction temperatures while maintaining high activity and selectivity.

These strategies aim to develop more efficient, stable, and cost-effective catalysts for industrial dehydrogenation processes, potentially reducing costs and improving process sustainability.
