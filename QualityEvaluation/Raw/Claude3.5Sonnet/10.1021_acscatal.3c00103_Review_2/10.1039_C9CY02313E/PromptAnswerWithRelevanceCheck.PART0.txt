[1] "Adding a promoter such as tin, which dilutes the platinum surface, is a commonly used strategy to boost the platinum catalyst efficiency in the industrial dehydrogenation reaction."

[2] "Herein, we report that a Pt/Cu cluster catalyst containing 100 ppm platinum using hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) nanosheets as a support significantly promotes the catalytic activity (>7 molC3H6 molPt1 s1, 520 C) for the dehydrogenation of propane to propylene."

[3] "The geometry of the Pt/Cu cluster together with the metallic platinum ensemble stabilized on the top layer of the copper cluster is verified to be responsible for the improvement in the catalytic efficiency."

[4] "Different from other supports, h-BN-sheet provides abundant stacking fault edges terminating with the BO defects. These BO defects include unpaired electrons, which can strongly interact with metal active species; meanwhile, the high affinity of the BO defects for electrons helps strengthen the interaction between the metal and support."

[5] "The unique strong bonding interaction between copper and the edge BO defects integrated with metallic platinum ensembles stabilized on the top layer of the copper clusters is the crucial factor that determines the catalytic performance of the Pt/Cu/h-BN-sheet catalyst in the dehydrogenation of propane."

Recent strategies to enhance catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts in direct dehydrogenation processes include:

1. Using promoters like tin to dilute the platinum surface, improving catalyst efficiency.

2. Employing novel support materials, such as hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) nanosheets, which can significantly promote catalytic activity even with very low platinum content.

3. Optimizing the geometry of bimetallic clusters, such as Pt/Cu clusters, where the metallic platinum ensemble is stabilized on the top layer of the copper cluster.

4. Utilizing supports with unique structural features, like h-BN sheets with abundant stacking fault edges terminated with BO defects. These defects can strongly interact with metal active species and strengthen the metal-support interaction.

5. Leveraging the strong bonding interaction between the metal (e.g., copper) and the support's defects (e.g., BO defects on h-BN edges) to stabilize the catalytic clusters and improve performance.

These advancements address challenges in catalyst design and performance optimization by:

- Minimizing platinum usage while maximizing catalytic activity
- Improving metal dispersion and stability on the support
- Enhancing metal-support interactions to prevent sintering and deactivation
- Optimizing the electronic and geometric structure of the active sites
- Providing a more stable and active catalyst system for industrial applications

These strategies contribute to the development of more efficient, stable, and cost-effective catalysts for direct dehydrogenation processes in industrial settings.
