Recent strategies to enhance catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts in direct dehydrogenation processes include:

1. Adding promoters like tin to dilute the platinum surface, improving catalyst efficiency.

2. Preparing small-sized clusters or single-atom catalysts to increase platinum utilization efficiency.

3. Optimizing the geometry of bimetallic clusters (e.g., Pt/Cu) with metallic platinum ensembles stabilized on the top layer.

4. Utilizing supports with strong interactions with metal clusters, such as h-BN nanosheets with edge defects.

5. Exploiting strong bonding interactions between metal species and support defects to maintain low-crystallized cluster geometry, promoting dispersion and stability of active species.

These advancements address challenges in catalyst design by:

1. Minimizing platinum usage while maximizing catalytic activity.
2. Improving catalyst stability through strong metal-support interactions.
3. Optimizing the geometric and electronic structure of active sites.
4. Enhancing metal dispersion and preventing sintering.
5. Enabling lower reaction temperatures and improved selectivity.

These strategies contribute to developing more efficient and stable catalysts for industrial dehydrogenation applications, potentially reducing costs and improving process sustainability.
