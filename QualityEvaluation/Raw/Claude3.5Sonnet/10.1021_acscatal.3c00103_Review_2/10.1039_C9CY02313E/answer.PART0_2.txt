[1] "Adding a promoter such as tin, which dilutes the platinum surface, is a commonly used strategy to boost the platinum catalyst efficiency in the industrial dehydrogenation reaction."

[2] "Further improvement in the platinum utilization efficiency can be achieved by preparing small-sized clusters or even single-atom catalysts using various methods."

[3] "The geometry of the Pt/Cu cluster together with the metallic platinum ensemble stabilized on the top layer of the copper cluster is verified to be responsible for the improvement in the catalytic efficiency."

[4] "The strong bonding interaction between copper and edge BO defects maintained low-crystallized cluster geometry, accordingly promoting both the dispersion and stability of catalytically active species, while the small platinum ensembles stabilized on the top layer of the copper cluster provided accessible platinum ensembles in the metallic state, which are recognized as ideal dehydrogenation sites."

[5] "The unique strong bonding interaction between copper and the edge BO defects integrated with metallic platinum ensembles stabilized on the top layer of the copper clusters is the crucial factor that determines the catalytic performance of the Pt/Cu/h-BN-sheet catalyst in the dehydrogenation of propane."

Recent strategies to enhance catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts in direct dehydrogenation processes include:

1. Adding promoters like tin to dilute the platinum surface, improving catalyst efficiency.

2. Preparing small-sized clusters or single-atom catalysts to increase platinum utilization efficiency.

3. Utilizing the geometry of Pt/Cu clusters with metallic platinum ensembles stabilized on top of copper clusters.
