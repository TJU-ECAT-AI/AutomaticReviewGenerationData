[1] "Adding a promoter such as tin, which dilutes the platinum surface, is a commonly used strategy to boost the platinum catalyst efficiency in the industrial dehydrogenation reaction."

[2] "Herein, we report that a Pt/Cu cluster catalyst containing 100 ppm platinum using hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) nanosheets as a support significantly promotes the catalytic activity (>7 molC3H6 molPt1 s1, 520 C) for the dehydrogenation of propane to propylene."

[3] "The geometry of the Pt/Cu cluster together with the metallic platinum ensemble stabilized on the top layer of the copper cluster is verified to be responsible for the improvement in the catalytic efficiency."

[4] "Different from other supports, h-BN-sheet provides abundant stacking fault edges terminating with the BO defects. These BO defects include unpaired electrons, which can strongly interact with metal active species; meanwhile, the high affinity of the BO defects for electrons helps strengthen the interaction between the metal and support."

[5] "The unique strong bonding interaction between copper and the edge BO defects integrated with metallic platinum ensembles stabilized on the top layer of the copper clusters is the crucial factor that determines the catalytic performance of the Pt/Cu/h-BN-sheet catalyst in the dehydrogenation of propane."

Recent strategies to enhance catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts in direct dehydrogenation processes include:

1. Using promoters like tin to dilute the platinum surface, improving catalyst efficiency.

2. Employing novel support materials, such as hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) nanosheets, which can significantly promote catalytic activity even with very low platinum content.

3. Optimizing the geometry of bimetallic clusters, such as Pt/Cu clusters, where the metallic platinum ensemble is stabilized on the top layer of the copper cluster.

4. Utilizing supports with unique structural features, like h-BN sheets with abundant stacking fault edges terminated with BO defects. These defects can strongly interact with metal active species and strengthen the metal-support interaction.

5. Leveraging the strong bonding interaction between the metal (e.g., copper) and the support's defects (e.g., BO defects on h-BN edges) to stabilize the catalytic clusters and improve performance.

These advancements address challenges in catalyst design and performance optimization by:

- Minimizing platinum usage while maximizing catalytic activity
- Improving metal dispersion and stability on the support
- Enhancing metal-support interactions to prevent sintering and deactivation
- Optimizing the electronic and geometric structure of the active sites
- Providing a more stable and active catalyst system for industrial applications

These strategies contribute to the development of more efficient, stable, and cost-effective catalysts for direct dehydrogenation processes in industrial settings.

最近为提高直接脱氢过程中负载金属催化剂的催化稳定性而开发的策略包括：

1. 使用锡等促进剂来稀释铂表面，提高催化剂效率。

2. 采用新型载体材料，如六方氮化硼（h-BN）纳米片，即使在铂含量很低的情况下也能显著提高催化活性。

3. 优化双金属簇的几何结构，如Pt/Cu簇，其中金属铂集合体稳定在铜簇的顶层。

4. 利用具有独特结构特征的载体，如具有丰富堆垛缺陷边缘的h-BN片，这些边缘以BO缺陷终止。这些缺陷可以与金属活性物种强烈相互作用，增强金属-载体相互作用。

5. 利用金属（如铜）与载体缺陷（如h-BN边缘上的BO缺陷）之间的强键合相互作用来稳定催化簇并提高性能。

这些进展通过以下方式解决了催化剂设计和性能优化方面的挑战：

- 最小化铂的使用量，同时最大化催化活性
- 改善金属在载体上的分散性和稳定性
- 增强金属-载体相互作用，防止烧结和失活
- 优化活性位点的电子和几何结构
- 为工业应用提供更稳定和活性更高的催化剂系统

这些策略有助于开发出更高效、更稳定和更具成本效益的催化剂，用于工业环境中的直接脱氢过程。
