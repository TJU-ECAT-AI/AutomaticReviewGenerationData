[1] "Adding a promoter such as tin, which dilutes the platinum surface, is a commonly used strategy to boost the platinum catalyst efficiency in the industrial dehydrogenation reaction."

[2] "Further improvement in the platinum utilization efficiency can be achieved by preparing small-sized clusters or even single-atom catalysts using various methods."

[3] "The geometry of the Pt/Cu cluster together with the metallic platinum ensemble stabilized on the top layer of the copper cluster is verified to be responsible for the improvement in the catalytic efficiency."

[4] "The strong bonding interaction between copper and edge BO defects maintained low-crystallized cluster geometry, accordingly promoting both the dispersion and stability of catalytically active species, while the small platinum ensembles stabilized on the top layer of the copper cluster provided accessible platinum ensembles in the metallic state, which are recognized as ideal dehydrogenation sites."

[5] "Different from other supports, h-BN-sheet provides abundant stacking fault edges terminating with the BO defects. These BO defects include unpaired electrons, which can strongly interact with metal active species; meanwhile, the high affinity of the BO defects for electrons helps strengthen the interaction between the metal and support."

Recent strategies to enhance catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts in direct dehydrogenation processes include:

1. Adding promoters like tin to dilute the platinum surface, improving catalyst efficiency.

2. Preparing small-sized clusters or single-atom catalysts to increase platinum utilization efficiency.

3. Designing bimetallic clusters (e.g., Pt/Cu) with specific geometries, where platinum ensembles are stabilized on top of copper clusters.

4. Using supports with unique properties, such as h-BN nanosheets, which provide abundant edge defects (BO) that strongly interact with metal species.

5. Leveraging strong metal-support interactions to maintain low-crystallized cluster geometry, promoting dispersion and stability of active species.

These advancements address challenges in catalyst design by:

1. Maximizing platinum utilization while minimizing its usage.
2. Improving catalyst stability through strong metal-support interactions.
3. Enhancing selectivity and activity by optimizing the geometry and electronic structure of active sites.
4. Developing supports that can better disperse and stabilize metal clusters.

These strategies aim to optimize catalyst performance for industrial applications by increasing activity, selectivity, and stability while reducing costs associated with precious metal usage.
