[1] "The anti-coking ability and propylene selectivity can be enhanced by alloying Pt with Cu, Sn, Ga, In, Ge, etc. via combined geometric and electronic effects."

[2] "With the addition of Sn, the steps of Pt3Sn become inert, because the steps tend to be decorated with Sn, thus they suppress further dehydrogenation of propylene and coke formation."

[3] "The surface enriched Sn divides large surface Pt ensembles into small pieces, which can further suppress the CC scission step, since it normally requires larger Pt ensembles than CH dissociation."

[4] "The introduction of Sn downshifts the d-band center of surface Pt atoms which lowers the binding strength of propylene, promotes its desorption and results in higher propylene selectivity."

[5] "The geometric effect of In is attributed to the creation of separated Pt atoms, which leads to the transformation from strong di-σ propylene adsorption mode to weak π adsorption mode. Moreover, the In atoms will cover low coordinated Pt atoms that tend to cause further dehydrogenation."

Recent strategies to enhance catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts in direct dehydrogenation processes include:

1. Alloying platinum with other metals like Cu, Sn, Ga, In, and Ge to improve anti-coking ability and selectivity through geometric and electronic effects.

2. Decorating step sites with secondary metals (e.g. Sn on Pt) to suppress further dehydrogenation and coke formation.

3. Using surface-enriched secondary metals to divide large metal ensembles into smaller pieces, inhibiting undesired C-C bond breaking.

4. Modifying the electronic structure of the primary metal (e.g. downshifting Pt d-band center) to weaken reactant binding and promote product desorption.

5. Creating separated active metal atoms and covering low-coordinated sites prone to over-dehydrogenation.

These advancements address challenges in catalyst design by optimizing both geometric and electronic effects to balance activity and selectivity. They aim to suppress side reactions and coking while maintaining sufficient activity for the desired dehydrogenation pathway. The approaches focus on rational design of bimetallic systems, controlled surface structures, and tuning of electronic properties to achieve more stable and selective catalysts for industrial applications.

最近提高直接脱氢过程中负载金属催化剂稳定性的策略包括：

1. 将铂与铜、锡、镓、铟和锗等其他金属合金化，通过几何和电子效应提高抗积炭能力和选择性。

2. 用次要金属（如在铂上添加锡）装饰台阶位点，以抑制进一步脱氢和积炭形成。

3. 使用表面富集的次要金属将大的金属团分割成较小的部分，抑制不需要的C-C键断裂。

4. 修改主要金属的电子结构（如降低铂的d带中心），以减弱反应物结合并促进产物脱附。

5. 创造分离的活性金属原子并覆盖容易过度脱氢的低配位位点。

这些进展通过优化几何和电子效应来平衡活性和选择性，解决了催化剂设计中的挑战。它们旨在抑制副反应和积炭，同时保持足够的活性以进行所需的脱氢途径。这些方法集中于双金属系统的理性设计、可控表面结构和电子性质的调节，以实现更稳定和选择性的工业应用催化剂。
