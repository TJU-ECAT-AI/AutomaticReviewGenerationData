[1] "The anti-coking ability and propylene selectivity can be enhanced by alloying Pt with Cu, Sn, Ga, In, Ge, etc. via combined geometric and electronic effects."

[2] "From the geometric perspective, low coordinated surface Pt atoms such as step sites are more active but less selective. With the addition of Sn, the steps of Pt3Sn become inert, because the steps tend to be decorated with Sn, thus they suppress further dehydrogenation of propylene and coke formation."

[3] "The introduction of Sn downshifts the d-band center of surface Pt atoms which lowers the binding strength of propylene, promotes its desorption and results in higher propylene selectivity."

[4] "The geometric effect of In is attributed to the creation of separated Pt atoms, which leads to the transformation from strong di-σ propylene adsorption mode to weak π adsorption mode. Moreover, the In atoms will cover low coordinated Pt atoms that tend to cause further dehydrogenation."

[5] "The addition of In lowers the d-band center of surface Pt and facilitates the desorption of propylene. Meanwhile, it brings a loss of catalytic activity for the PDH reaction."

Recent strategies to enhance catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts in direct dehydrogenation processes include:

1. Alloying platinum with other metals like copper, tin, gallium, indium, and germanium. This combines geometric and electronic effects to improve anti-coking ability and selectivity.

2. Modifying the surface structure by decorating low-coordinated sites (e.g. steps) with alloying elements. This suppresses further dehydrogenation and coke formation at these highly active but less selective sites.

3. Tuning the electronic properties of the catalyst surface. For example, adding tin or indium lowers the d-band center of surface platinum atoms, which weakens propylene binding and promotes its desorption.

4. Creating separated active metal atoms through alloying. This changes the adsorption mode of reactants/products from strong to weak binding.

5. Covering highly active low-coordinated sites with alloying elements to prevent over-dehydrogenation.

These advancements address challenges in catalyst design by:

- Improving selectivity while maintaining acceptable activity
- Enhancing resistance to coking and deactivation
- Allowing fine-tuning of surface electronic and geometric properties
- Providing a fundamental understanding of structure-performance relationships

This enables more rational design of industrial catalysts with optimized stability, activity and selectivity for direct dehydrogenation processes.

最近直接脱氢过程中提高负载金属催化剂稳定性的策略包括：

1. 将铂与铜、锡、镓、铟和锗等其他金属合金化。这结合了几何和电子效应，提高了抗积炭能力和选择性。

2. 通过用合金元素装饰低配位位点（如台阶）来修饰表面结构。这抑制了这些高活性但选择性较低的位点上的进一步脱氢和积炭形成。

3. 调节催化剂表面的电子特性。例如，添加锡或铟降低了表面铂原子的d带中心，这削弱了丙烯的结合并促进其脱附。

4. 通过合金化创造分离的活性金属原子。这改变了反应物/产物的吸附模式，从强结合变为弱结合。

5. 用合金元素覆盖高活性的低配位位点，以防止过度脱氢。

这些进展通过以下方式解决了催化剂设计中的挑战：

- 在保持可接受活性的同时提高选择性
- 增强抗积炭和失活的能力
- 允许对表面电子和几何特性进行精细调节
- 提供结构-性能关系的基本理解

这使得可以更合理地设计工业催化剂，为直接脱氢过程优化稳定性、活性和选择性。
