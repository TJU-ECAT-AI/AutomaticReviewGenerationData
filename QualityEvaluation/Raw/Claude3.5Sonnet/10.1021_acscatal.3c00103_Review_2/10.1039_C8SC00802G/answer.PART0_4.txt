[1] "The anti-coking ability and propylene selectivity can be enhanced by alloying Pt with Cu, Sn, Ga, In, Ge, etc. via combined geometric and electronic effects."

[2] "With the addition of Sn, the steps of Pt3Sn become inert, because the steps tend to be decorated with Sn, thus they suppress further dehydrogenation of propylene and coke formation."

[3] "The surface enriched Sn divides large surface Pt ensembles into small pieces, which can further suppress the CC scission step, since it normally requires larger Pt ensembles than CH dissociation."

[4] "The introduction of Sn downshifts the d-band center of surface Pt atoms which lowers the binding strength of propylene, promotes its desorption and results in higher propylene selectivity."

[5] "The geometric effect of In is attributed to the creation of separated Pt atoms, which leads to the transformation from strong di-σ propylene adsorption mode to weak π adsorption mode. Moreover, the In atoms will cover low coordinated Pt atoms that tend to cause further dehydrogenation."

Recent strategies to enhance catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts in direct dehydrogenation processes include:

1. Alloying Pt with other metals like Cu, Sn, Ga, In, and Ge to improve anti-coking ability and propylene selectivity through geometric and electronic effects.

2. Decorating step sites with secondary metals (e.g. Sn on Pt) to suppress further dehydrogenation and coke formation.

3. Using surface-enriched secondary metals to divide large surface ensembles of the primary metal into smaller pieces, inhibiting undesired side reactions.

4. Modifying the electronic structure of the primary metal (e.g. downshifting Pt d-band center) to reduce binding strength of intermediates and promote product desorption.

5. Creating separated active metal atoms and covering low-coordinated sites prone to over-dehydrogenation through geometric effects of the secondary metal.

These approaches address challenges in catalyst design by tuning both the geometric structure and electronic properties of the active sites to optimize activity, selectivity and stability. They aim to balance the catalyst's ability to activate the reactant while preventing unwanted side reactions and coking, which are key issues for industrial applications.

最近提高直接脱氢过程中负载金属催化剂稳定性的策略包括：

1. 将铂与铜、锡、镓、铟和锗等其他金属合金化，通过几何和电子效应提高抗积碳能力和丙烯选择性。

2. 用次要金属（如锡在铂上）装饰台阶位点，抑制进一步脱氢和积碳形成。

3. 使用表面富集的次要金属将主要金属的大表面集合体分割成更小的部分，抑制不需要的副反应。

4. 修改主要金属的电子结构（如下移铂的d带中心），以减少中间体的结合强度并促进产物脱附。

5. 通过次要金属的几何效应创建分离的活性金属原子，并覆盖容易过度脱氢的低配位位点。

这些方法通过调整活性位点的几何结构和电子性质来解决催化剂设计中的挑战，以优化活性、选择性和稳定性。它们旨在平衡催化剂活化反应物的能力，同时防止不需要的副反应和积碳，这是工业应用中的关键问题。
