          [1] "The anti-coking ability and propylene selectivity can be enhanced by alloying Pt with Cu, Sn, Ga, In, Ge, etc. via combined geometric and electronic effects."

          [2] "From the geometric perspective, low coordinated surface Pt atoms such as step sites are more active but less selective. With the addition of Sn, the steps of Pt3Sn become inert, because the steps tend to be decorated with Sn, thus they suppress further dehydrogenation of propylene and coke formation."

          [3] "The introduction of Sn downshifts the d-band center of surface Pt atoms which lowers the binding strength of propylene, promotes its desorption and results in higher propylene selectivity."

          [4] "The geometric role of In is not only separating the Pt atoms, but also covering the step Pt atoms while the electronic effect can be attributed to the electron transfer from In to Pt."

          [5] "The geometric effect of In is attributed to the creation of separated Pt atoms, which leads to the transformation from strong di-σ propylene adsorption mode to weak π adsorption mode. Moreover, the In atoms will cover low coordinated Pt atoms that tend to cause further dehydrogenation."

          [6] "The surface enriched Sn divides large surface Pt ensembles into small pieces, which can further suppress the CC scission step, since it normally requires larger Pt ensembles than CH dissociation."

          Recent strategies to enhance catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts in direct dehydrogenation processes include:

          1. Alloying platinum with other metals (Cu, Sn, Ga, In, Ge) to improve anti-coking ability and propylene selectivity through combined geometric and electronic effects.

          2. Modifying catalyst surface structure by decorating low-coordinated sites (e.g., steps) with secondary metals to suppress further dehydrogenation and coke formation. For example, adding Sn to Pt makes step sites inert.

          3. Tuning the electronic properties of the catalyst surface. For instance, introducing Sn or In downshifts the d-band center of surface Pt atoms, weakening propylene binding and promoting its desorption, resulting in higher selectivity.

          4. Creating separated active metal atoms through alloying. This changes the adsorption mode of propylene from strong di-σ to weak π, improving selectivity.

          5. Using surface-enriched secondary metals to divide large surface ensembles of the primary metal into smaller pieces, inhibiting undesired side reactions like C-C bond breaking.

          6. Covering highly active low-coordinated sites with alloying elements to prevent over-dehydrogenation.

          These advancements address challenges in catalyst design by optimizing both geometric and electronic effects to balance activity, selectivity, and stability. They aim to suppress side reactions and coking while maintaining sufficient activity for the desired dehydrogenation pathway, enabling more rational design of industrial catalysts for direct dehydrogenation processes.

          最近提高直接脱氢过程中负载金属催化剂稳定性的策略包括：

          1. 将铂与其他金属（铜、锡、镓、铟、锗）合金化，通过结合几何和电子效应来提高抗积碳能力和丙烯选择性。

          2. 通过用次要金属装饰低配位位点（如台阶）来修饰催化剂表面结构，抑制进一步脱氢和积碳形成。例如，向铂中添加锡使台阶位点变得惰性。

          3. 调节催化剂表面的电子性质。例如，引入锡或铟降低表面铂原子的d带中心，减弱丙烯的结合并促进其脱附，从而提高选择性。

          4. 通过合金化创造分离的活性金属原子。这改变了丙烯的吸附模式，从强di-σ变为弱π，提高了选择性。

          5. 使用表面富集的次要金属将主要金属的大表面集合体分割成更小的部分，抑制不需要的副反应，如C-C键断裂。

          6. 用合金元素覆盖高活性的低配位位点，以防止过度脱氢。

          这些进展通过优化几何和电子效应来平衡活性、选择性和稳定性，解决了催化剂设计中的挑战。它们旨在抑制副反应和积碳，同时保持足够的活性以进行所需的脱氢途径，使得可以更合理地设计直接脱氢过程的工业催化剂。
