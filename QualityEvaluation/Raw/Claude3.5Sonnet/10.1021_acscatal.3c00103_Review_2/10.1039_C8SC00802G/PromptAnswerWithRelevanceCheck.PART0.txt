[1] "The anti-coking ability and propylene selectivity can be enhanced by alloying Pt with Cu, Sn, Ga, In, Ge, etc. via combined geometric and electronic effects."

[2] "From the geometric perspective, low coordinated surface Pt atoms such as step sites are more active but less selective. With the addition of Sn, the steps of Pt3Sn become inert, because the steps tend to be decorated with Sn, thus they suppress further dehydrogenation of propylene and coke formation."

[3] "The introduction of Sn downshifts the d-band center of surface Pt atoms which lowers the binding strength of propylene, promotes its desorption and results in higher propylene selectivity."

[4] "The geometric role of In is not only separating the Pt atoms, but also covering the step Pt atoms while the electronic effect can be attributed to the electron transfer from In to Pt."

Recent strategies to enhance catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts in direct dehydrogenation processes include:

1. Alloying platinum with other metals like copper, tin, gallium, indium, and germanium. This approach combines geometric and electronic effects to improve anti-coking ability and propylene selectivity.

2. Modifying the surface structure of catalysts. For example, adding tin to platinum decorates the step sites, making them inert. This suppresses further dehydrogenation of propylene and coke formation on these highly active but less selective sites.

3. Tuning the electronic properties of the catalyst surface. The introduction of alloying elements like tin can downshift the d-band center of surface platinum atoms, which weakens propylene binding, promotes its desorption, and increases selectivity.

4. Optimizing the distribution and coordination of active metal sites. For instance, indium not only separates platinum atoms but also covers step platinum atoms, altering the catalyst's surface properties.

These advancements address challenges in catalyst design by providing strategies to balance activity and selectivity, improve stability by reducing coke formation, and optimize electronic properties for better performance. They offer pathways to develop more efficient and durable catalysts for industrial applications in direct dehydrogenation processes.

最近提高直接脱氢过程中负载金属催化剂稳定性的策略包括：

1. 将铂与铜、锡、镓、铟和锗等其他金属合金化。这种方法结合了几何和电子效应，以提高抗积碳能力和丙烯选择性。

2. 修改催化剂的表面结构。例如，向铂中添加锡可以装饰台阶位，使其变得惰性。这抑制了在这些高活性但选择性较低的位点上丙烯的进一步脱氢和焦炭形成。

3. 调节催化剂表面的电子性质。引入锡等合金元素可以降低表面铂原子的d带中心，从而减弱丙烯的结合，促进其脱附，并提高选择性。

4. 优化活性金属位点的分布和配位。例如，铟不仅分离铂原子，还覆盖台阶铂原子，改变催化剂的表面性质。

这些进展通过提供平衡活性和选择性的策略、通过减少焦炭形成来提高稳定性、以及优化电子性质以获得更好的性能，解决了催化剂设计中的挑战。它们为开发直接脱氢过程中更高效和更耐用的工业应用催化剂提供了途径。

5. Covering highly active low-coordinated sites with alloying elements to prevent over-dehydrogenation.

These advancements address challenges in catalyst design by:

- Improving selectivity while maintaining acceptable activity
- Enhancing resistance to coking and deactivation
- Allowing fine-tuning of surface electronic and geometric properties
- Providing a fundamental understanding of structure-performance relationships

This enables more rational design of industrial catalysts with optimized stability, activity and selectivity for direct dehydrogenation processes.
