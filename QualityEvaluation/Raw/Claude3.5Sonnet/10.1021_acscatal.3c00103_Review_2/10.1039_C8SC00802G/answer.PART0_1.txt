[1] "The anti-coking ability and propylene selectivity can be enhanced by alloying Pt with Cu, Sn, Ga, In, Ge, etc. via combined geometric and electronic effects."

[2] "From the geometric perspective, low coordinated surface Pt atoms such as step sites are more active but less selective. With the addition of Sn, the steps of Pt3Sn become inert, because the steps tend to be decorated with Sn, thus they suppress further dehydrogenation of propylene and coke formation."

[3] "The introduction of Sn downshifts the d-band center of surface Pt atoms which lowers the binding strength of propylene, promotes its desorption and results in higher propylene selectivity."

[4] "The geometric role of In is not only separating the Pt atoms, but also covering the step Pt atoms while the electronic effect can be attributed to the electron transfer from In to Pt."

Recent strategies to enhance catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts in direct dehydrogenation processes include:

1. Alloying platinum with other metals like Cu, Sn, Ga, In, and Ge to improve anti-coking ability and propylene selectivity through geometric and electronic effects.

2. Modifying catalyst surface structure by decorating low-coordinated sites (e.g. steps) with secondary metals to suppress further dehydrogenation and coke formation.

3. Tuning the electronic properties of the catalyst surface, such as downshifting the d-band center, to weaken propylene binding and promote its desorption.

4. Optimizing metal ratios and distributions to balance activity and selectivity, as demonstrated with the Pt3In catalyst identified through computational screening.

5. Using probability-based computational screening methods to identify promising catalyst compositions while accounting for uncertainties in DFT calculations.

These advancements address challenges in catalyst design by providing strategies to simultaneously improve activity, selectivity and stability. They offer guidance for rationally designing catalysts with optimized surface properties and compositions for industrial dehydrogenation applications.

最近为提高直接脱氢过程中负载金属催化剂的催化稳定性而开发的策略包括：

1. 将铂与铜、锡、镓、铟和锗等其他金属合金化，通过几何和电子效应来提高抗积碳能力和丙烯选择性。

2. 通过用次要金属装饰低配位位点（如台阶）来修饰催化剂表面结构，抑制进一步脱氢和积碳形成。

3. 调节催化剂表面的电子性质，如下移d带中心，以减弱丙烯的结合并促进其脱附。

4. 优化金属比例和分布以平衡活性和选择性，如通过计算筛选确定的Pt3In催化剂所示。

5. 使用基于概率的计算筛选方法来识别有前景的催化剂组成，同时考虑DFT计算中的不确定性。

这些进展通过提供同时提高活性、选择性和稳定性的策略来解决催化剂设计中的挑战。它们为合理设计具有优化表面性质和组成的工业脱氢应用催化剂提供了指导。
