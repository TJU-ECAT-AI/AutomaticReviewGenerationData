          [1] "Alloying of Pt with one or more TMs, such as Sn, Ti, Ga, Cu, Co, Zn, Ir, and In, is an effective way to improve the catalytic performance in PDH."

[2] "The addition of Sn into Pt(111) can lower the energy barrier for propylene desorption and simultaneously increase the activation energy for propylene dehydrogenation"

[3] "The dopants can promote the dispersion of Pt particles and thus prevent their sintering, suppress the structure-sensitive side reactions including hydrogenolysis and deep dehydrogenation to reduce the rate of carbon deposition, and promote the migration of carbon deposition from active metal components to the carrier, etc."

[4] "Selecting suitable catalyst supports is also an effective way to modify the catalytic performance of metal catalysts for PDH."

[5] "The addition of an appropriate amount of TiO2 in Pt/TiO2Al2O3 catalysts can improve propylene selectivity and catalyst stability. The reasons are that the electrons could be transferred from the partially reduced TiOx (x < 2) to the Pt atoms, and the partial coverage of the metal surface by TiOx species, and thus the increased electron density of Pt can hinder propylene adsorption on active metal sites and facilitate coke migration from the active sites to the carrier."

[6] "Atomic layer deposition (ALD) of alumina on Pt step edge sites significantly suppresses unselective deep dehydrogenation and coke formation"

[7] "Some novel coreshell Pt-based catalysts can not only improve the catalytic performance but also effectively increase the utilization efficiency of precious metals."

[8] "The addition of Sn can help Pt re-disperse in the catalyst regeneration by providing nucleation sites on the γ-Al2O3 surface to achieve superior catalyst stability."

          Recent key strategies and approaches to enhance the catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts in direct dehydrogenation processes include:

1. Alloying Pt with transition metals (TMs) such as Sn, Ti, Ga, Cu, Co, Zn, Ir, and In. This improves overall catalytic performance by modifying electronic and geometric properties of the catalyst surface.

2. Using dopants to promote metal dispersion, prevent sintering, suppress side reactions, reduce carbon deposition, and promote carbon migration from active sites to the support.

3. Optimizing catalyst supports, such as using TiO2-Al2O3 mixed oxides. The addition of TiO2 can improve propylene selectivity and catalyst stability by modifying electron transfer and surface coverage.

4. Employing atomic layer deposition (ALD) techniques, like depositing alumina on Pt step edges to suppress undesired deep dehydrogenation and coking.

5. Developing novel core-shell Pt-based catalysts to improve catalytic performance and increase the utilization efficiency of precious metals.

6. Adding Sn to help Pt re-disperse during catalyst regeneration by providing nucleation sites on supports like γ-Al2O3.

These advancements address challenges in catalyst design, fabrication, and performance optimization for industrial applications by:

- Enhancing selectivity towards desired products
- Improving resistance to coking and deactivation
- Increasing catalyst lifetime and stability
- Optimizing precious metal utilization
- Enabling more efficient catalyst regeneration
- Balancing activity, selectivity, and stability requirements

Overall, these strategies aim to develop more stable, selective, and long-lasting catalysts suitable for industrial dehydrogenation processes by fine-tuning the electronic and geometric properties of active sites at the atomic and molecular level.

          最近用于提高直接脱氢过程中负载金属催化剂催化稳定性的关键策略和方法包括：

1. 将铂与过渡金属（TMs）如锡、钛、镓、铜、钴、锌、铱和铟合金化。这通过修改催化剂表面的电子和几何性质来提高整体催化性能。

2. 使用掺杂剂来促进金属分散、防止烧结、抑制副反应、减少碳沉积，并促进碳从活性位点向载体迁移。

3. 优化催化剂载体，如使用TiO2-Al2O3混合氧化物。添加TiO2可以通过调节电子转移和表面覆盖来提高丙烯选择性和催化剂稳定性。

4. 采用原子层沉积（ALD）技术，如在铂台阶边缘沉积氧化铝，以抑制不需要的深度脱氢和积碳。

5. 开发新型铂基核壳结构催化剂，以提高催化性能并提高贵金属的利用效率。

6. 添加锡以帮助铂在催化剂再生过程中重新分散，在γ-Al2O3等载体上提供成核位点。
