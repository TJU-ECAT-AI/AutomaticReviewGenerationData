[1] "The optimal 10Zn0.1Pt/HZ catalyst (consisting of 1000 ppm Pt and 10 wt% Zn) shows a high propylene yield (about 46%) and extraordinary dehydrogenation stability over 65 h at 525 C without any regeneration procedure or H2 as auxiliary gas."

[2] "It is revealed that this catalyst has two kinds of active centers which work corporately: (i) Lewis acidic sites created by framework Zn species and (ii) small-sized PtZn particles."

[3] "The stable state of the active species and strong carbon resistance of 10Zn0.1Pt/HZ related to the interaction effect between Pt and Zn are confirmed, accounting for the admirable reaction stability of PDH."

[4] "Both the small-sized PtZn particles and Lewis acidic framework Zn species make contributions to the high catalytic activity of PDH, following a metalacid bifunctional mechanism, and a balance between the metal and acid functions can be realized on the 10Zn0.1Pt/HZ catalyst."

[5] "The surface interactions between Pt and Zn are revealed by the H2-TPR and XPS measurements, leading to the strong coke resistance and the stable state of Pt and Zn of 10Zn0.1Pt/HZ which are responsible for the ultra-stable activity for PDH over 65 h at 525 C."

[6] "As a result, the supported Zn and a trace amount of Pt work corporately and result in high catalytic activity and great stability at 525 C, and this sheds a bright light on the design of other hyperstable dehydrogenation catalysts."

[7] "A high Zn/Pt ratio can lead to high dispersion and great thermal stability of metal phases"

[8] "The synergistic effect between Pt and Zn is proved by the H2-TPR results, in which the co-reduction peak of partial Pt and Zn is in between the reduction temperatures of platinum oxides and zinc oxides."

[1] "Pt-based catalysts are widely used in propane dehydrogenation reaction for the production of propylene. Suppressing irreversible deactivation caused by the sintering of Pt particles under harsh conditions and regeneration process is a significant challenge in this catalyst."

[2] "The coordinatively unsaturated pentacoordinate Al3+ (Al3+penta) can strongly anchor Pt atoms via a formation of Al-O-Pt bond, and thus stabilize the Pt-based particles at the surface of Al2O3."

[3] "The stability and regenerability of Pt-Sn2/meso-Al2O3 are strongly dependent on the content of Al3+penta sites in the Al2O3 structure, and a high level of Al3+penta sites can effectively prevent the agglomeration of Pt-Sn2 clusters into large Pt nanoparticles in the consecutive dehydrogenation-regeneration cycles."

[4] "The Pt-Sn2/meso-Al2O3-600 with the highest level of Al3+penta (50.8%) delivers the best performance in propane dehydrogenation, which exhibits propane conversion of 40% and propylene selectivity above 98% at 570 C with 10 vol% C3H8 and 10 vol% H2 feed."

[5] "A slow deactivation in this catalyst is ascribed to the formation of coke, and the catalytic performance can be fully restored in the consecutive dehydrogenation-regeneration cycles via a simple calcination treatment."

[1] "Zeolites with well-defined microporous channel structures and excellent thermal stability are considered as ideal supports for stabilizing metal species. In particular, zeolite-encaged metal catalysts possess unique and remarkable catalytic stability, which is very attractive in heterogeneous catalysis"

[2] "Recently, Pt and PtM catalysts (M = Zn, Sn) have been encapsulated into zeolites, and the reports have shown that the zeolite-encapsulated supported catalysts with excellent stability are valuable in practical applications"

[3] "Herein, highly dispersed Ga-Pt bimetallic clusters encapsulated within a purely siliceous silicalite-1 zeolite (S-1, MFI zeotype) were prepared by an in situ method of hydrothermal process and subsequent ligand-protected direct H2 reduction."

[4] "Notably, the resulting GaPt@S-1 catalyst displays excellent catalytic performance and high stability during PDH."

[1] "The anti-coking ability and propylene selectivity can be enhanced by alloying Pt with Cu, Sn, Ga, In, Ge, etc. via combined geometric and electronic effects."

          [2] "From the geometric perspective, low coordinated surface Pt atoms such as step sites are more active but less selective. With the addition of Sn, the steps of Pt3Sn become inert, because the steps tend to be decorated with Sn, thus they suppress further dehydrogenation of propylene and coke formation."

          [3] "The introduction of Sn downshifts the d-band center of surface Pt atoms which lowers the binding strength of propylene, promotes its desorption and results in higher propylene selectivity."

          [4] "The geometric role of In is not only separating the Pt atoms, but also covering the step Pt atoms while the electronic effect can be attributed to the electron transfer from In to Pt."

          [5] "The geometric effect of In is attributed to the creation of separated Pt atoms, which leads to the transformation from strong di-σ propylene adsorption mode to weak π adsorption mode. Moreover, the In atoms will cover low coordinated Pt atoms that tend to cause further dehydrogenation."

          [6] "The surface enriched Sn divides large surface Pt ensembles into small pieces, which can further suppress the CC scission step, since it normally requires larger Pt ensembles than CH dissociation."

[1] "We synthesize γ-alumina-supported platinum/copper SAA catalysts by incipient wetness co-impregnation method with a high copper to platinum ratio."

[2] "Single platinum atoms dispersed on copper nanoparticles dramatically enhance the desorption of surface-bounded propylene and prohibit its further dehydrogenation, resulting in high propylene selectivity (90%)."

[3] "Unlike previous reported SAA applications at low temperatures (<400C), Pt/Cu SAA shows excellent stability of more than 120h of operation under atmospheric pressure at 520C."

[4] "Our DFT calculations suggest that Pt/Cu SAA indeed breaks the PtM alloy scaling relationship, which is different from the scaling for conventional Pt alloys during the PDH"

[5] "The Pt/Cu SAA catalyst with the low loading of Pt (0.1wt%) displays propylene selectivity of 90% with the high formation rate of 10.6molg1Pth1 under the conditions of atmospheric pressure, 520C, WHSV=4h1, C3H8/N2=1/1 and shows excellent stability for at least 120h on stream."

[6] "Herein, we report that Pt/Cu single atom alloy (SAA) breaks the PtM alloy scaling relationship during the PDH, with a great improvement of propylene selectivity and a slight loss of intrinsic dehydrogenation activity."

[7] "During the PDH at 520C, the propylene formation rate dramatically dropped from 3.7 to 1.6molg1Pth1 for 0.1Pt/Al2O3 after 12h on stream. As a contrast, we did not observe deactivation for 0.1Pt10Cu/Al2O3 upon 12h on stream and the propylene formation rate only slightly decreased from 10.6 to 10.3molg1Pth1 even after 120h on stream."

[8] "The low deactivation rate of 0.0005h−1 for 0.1Pt10Cu/Al2O3 quantitatively demonstrates its high stability when compared to 0.07h−1 for 0.1Pt/Al2O3"

[9] "The variation trend of CO adsorption behavior is highly consistent with that of the initial activities of the catalysts as the Cu content increases."

[1] "To alleviate these problems, Sn is introduced to form an alloy with Pt nanoparticles and thereby dilute the Pt surface with inactive Sn atoms and break up coke-generating Pt ensembles."

[2] "Our search for a highly active and more durable PDH catalyst has focused on using a siliceous MFI zeolite with a hierarchical micro-/mesoporous structure as a replacement for the alumina support."

[3] "We incorporated La and Y along with Pt into this mesoporous zeolite to improve the Pt catalyst dispersion, as these rare-earth element (REE) oxides are known for their strong metalsupport interactions with Pt that stabilize the latter in the form of small nanoparticles"

[4] "We intentionally generated silanol nests by synthesizing a mesoporous gallosilicate zeolite and subsequently removing the framework Ga atoms using nitric acid"

[5] "The formation of the Pt3La and Pt3Y nanoparticles on the degallated zeolite brought a striking enhancement in all aspects of the PDH catalytic performance, including activity, selectivity and durability"

[6] "The high PDH catalytic performance of PtLa/mz-deGa and PtY/mz-deGa can be ascribed to the critical role of surface silanol nests that enabled atomistic alloying of La and Y into Pt nanoparticles."

[1] "Pt is the most versatile noble metal catalyst for alkane reactions. Although Pt is expensive, the choice of Pt is often justified by its higher activity, stability and selectivity for these reactions compared to less expensive alternative transition metals."

[2] "Waku et al. exploited the unique property of zeolite as a support for achieving high metal dispersion through cation exchange sites to create a Pt/Na[Fe]-ZSM-5 catalyst with outstanding stability for dehydrogenation of light alkanes."

[3] "They found that the catalyst deactivation rate of Pt/Na[Fe]-ZSM-5 was lower than for any other Pt-based catalysts in refractory oxide support. The unprecedented performance of Pt/Na[Fe]-ZSM-5 was attributed to its high Pt dispersion (cluster size < 1 mm) on zeolite through ion-exchange."

[4] "There is a tendency to generate some Brnsted protons on the zeolite during the exchange process, but the choice of Fe3+ as an isomorphous cation in place of Al3+ led to weaker Brnsted sites in [Fe]-ZSM compared to [Al]-ZSM. The weaker acidity minimizes the tendency of side reactions (cracking of oligomerization, aromatisation, and coke), which translates into higher alkene selectivity and catalyst stability."

[5] "Promotion of Pt with metals, such as Sn, Ga, Zn, Re, etc., improves catalyst stability, but also leads to faster deactivation rates than Pt/Na[Fe]-ZSM-5."

[6] "Recent reports by Bell et al. show that the use of calcined hydrotalcite (Al/Mg  0.1) supported on bimetallic PtGa or PtSn gave very high alkene selectivity and stability, comparable to Pt/Na[Fe]-ZSM-5."

[7] "Elimination of the proton sites of zeolites is critical for obtaining a high alkene selectivity and stability in dehydrogenation catalysts."

[1] "Alloying of Pt with one or more TMs, such as Sn, Ti, Ga, Cu, Co, Zn, Ir, and In, is an effective way to improve the catalytic performance in PDH."

[2] "The addition of Sn into Pt(111) can lower the energy barrier for propylene desorption and simultaneously increase the activation energy for propylene dehydrogenation"

[3] "The dopants can promote the dispersion of Pt particles and thus prevent their sintering, suppress the structure-sensitive side reactions including hydrogenolysis and deep dehydrogenation to reduce the rate of carbon deposition, and promote the migration of carbon deposition from active metal components to the carrier, etc."

[4] "Selecting suitable catalyst supports is also an effective way to modify the catalytic performance of metal catalysts for PDH."

[5] "The addition of an appropriate amount of TiO2 in Pt/TiO2Al2O3 catalysts can improve propylene selectivity and catalyst stability. The reasons are that the electrons could be transferred from the partially reduced TiOx (x < 2) to the Pt atoms, and the partial coverage of the metal surface by TiOx species, and thus the increased electron density of Pt can hinder propylene adsorption on active metal sites and facilitate coke migration from the active sites to the carrier."

[6] "Atomic layer deposition (ALD) of alumina on Pt step edge sites significantly suppresses unselective deep dehydrogenation and coke formation"

[7] "Some novel coreshell Pt-based catalysts can not only improve the catalytic performance but also effectively increase the utilization efficiency of precious metals."

[8] "The addition of Sn can help Pt re-disperse in the catalyst regeneration by providing nucleation sites on the γ-Al2O3 surface to achieve superior catalyst stability."

[1] "VOx/ZrO2, a well-known catalyst for ODH, has a much more superior PDH performance than commonly used VOx/Al2O3. The turnover frequency (TOF) is six times higher by loading VOx on ZrO2 than on Al2O3."

[2] "Combining H2-temperature programmed reduction, in situ Raman spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and theoretical studies, we find that the interaction between VOx and ZrO2 can facilitate the reduction of VO bonds, including VO, VOV and VOZr."

[3] "The promoting effect could be attributed to the formation of low coordinated V species in VOx/ZrO2 which is more active in CH activation."

[4] "We performed 120 min of the on stream reaction and studied the reaction–regeneration cycles over 1VZr (Fig. S2b and S3). The propane conversion and propylene selectivity exhibit little change during six cycles, implying outstanding regeneration stability."

[5] "Alternatively, supported vanadium oxide is a promising catalyst compared with Pt and CrOx for its competitive performance, low cost and low toxicity."

[6] "We propose the enhanced CH activation on VZr results from the facile reduction of VO, VOV and VOZr bonds, thus producing deeply reduced and lower coordinated V species."

[7] "It is generally accepted that the support could affect reactivity by stabilizing the active sites and/or altering the electron state of active sites."

[8] "Considering the dramatic performance achieved through the interaction between VOx and ZrO2, our work provides a new insight into high-performance VOx-based catalysts for propane dehydrogenation."

[1] "When Sn is added to a Pt/Al2O3 catalyst, the Ptalkene interaction is weakened and side reactions are suppressed [13,14,15,16,17]. Thus, Sn may enhance the propylene selectivity of the PDH reaction [18,19]."

[2] "It has also been reported that Sn plays important roles in preventing Pt sintering, lowering the acidity of the oxide support, and removing the coke generated during the PDH process [4,20]."

[3] "Deng and coworkers [10,21,22] used a direct reduction method to prepare PDH catalysts, which did not include a calcination step, unlike the conventional protocol for catalyst preparation involving drying, calcination, and reduction."

[4] "The direct reduction method yielded a catalyst with much higher performance than the conventionally calcined catalyst considering propane conversion, as well as propylene selectivity."

[5] "We suspect that the interaction between propane and the PtSn alloys is greater for the Pt3Sn alloy than the PtSn alloy. Thus, the greater number of interactions enhances the PDH reaction and more coke is formed."

[6] "When coke accumulates, the metal sites become covered, which could inhibit the PDH reaction. If drain-off occurs, the active sites of catalysts are recovered."

[7] "Zhu et al. [9] reported a Sn-surface-enriched PtSn bimetallic nanoparticle catalyst prepared on a MgAl2O4 support using an organometallic chemistry concept, and the catalyst exhibited high selectivity and stability during the PDH reaction."

[8] "In our previous study [23], we reported that oxychlorination treatment was effective in regenerating PtSn/Al2O3 catalysts after the PDH reaction, and we observed that catalysts containing Pt3Sn alloys after oxychlorination treatment showed improved PDH activity."

[9] "As shown in Figure 2, the propylene selectivity values determined after 1 h were in the order of SR500 > SR550 > SR600 > Cal600 > SR450 > SR800 > SR900."

[10] "We can propose that the synergistic effect of the interaction of Pt and Sn covering the surface of Pt, as well as the accessible Pt sites, could improve the dehydrogenation performance of the catalyst prepared by the direct reduction method."

[1] "The modification of metal oxides by noble metals has been proved to be an effective strategy to improve the low reactivity of metal oxides in catalyzing PDH."

[2] "Researchers have proposed various regulatory mechanisms of noble metals on metal oxides. Gong and co-workers revealed that ZnO was promoted to be a stronger Lewis acid through the electron transfer from metal oxide to Pt, which attenuated the reduction of ZnO and enhanced the stability."

[3] "Kondratenko and co-workers suggested that low hydrogen adsorption energy barrier on Rh was favorable for H2 dissociation into H atoms and spillover onto the surface of ZrO2. Thus, the lattice oxygen was removed from ZrO2 to generate more coordinately unsaturated Zr4+ sites for PDH reaction."

[4] "With trace amounts (<0.15wt%) of noble metals, PDH reaction performance on zirconia can be enhanced prominently."

[5] "The low deactivation rate (kd=0.03h1) at 550C demonstrates its high stability"

[6] "Optimally, 0.03Pt3Ga2O3 catalyst obtains about 97mmolg1h1 of propylene formation rate, which exceeds 25% of the summed contribution of individual 0.03Pt and 3Ga2O3, and achieves the most noticeable synergistic effect."

[7] "The presence of Pt promotes H2 dissociation and surface coverage of hydrogen species, which is beneficial for the activation of CH in propane."

[8] "Weckhuysen and co-workers4a have found that with 1000ppm Pt modification, propane conversion was doubled in comparison with pure Ga2O3."

[1] "Although supported Pt catalysts show high activity, the catalyst deactivation due to coke formation remains a challenging issue."

[2] "The robustness against coking can be increased with additional promoters, such as late transition metals, main-group metals including Sn and Ga, alkali-metal oxides and rare-earth metal oxides."

[3] "Previous experimental studies have shown that the selectivity towards propylene during propane dehydrogenation on Pt particles can be increased by alloying late transition metals or main-group metals such as Cu and Sn."

[4] "DFT calculations indicate that the binding energy of propylene is weakened by at least 8 kJ mol1 after alloying different amounts of Sn in Pt(111). Meanwhile, all the dehydrogenation barriers shift up, including deep dehydrogenation from propylene."

[5] "Calculations have shown that these elements tend to occupy the step sites and thus avoid the formation of graphene islands."

[6] "Different approaches have been proposed to encounter the coking problem. It could be shown that the adsorption of C atoms on the closed packed surface of a NiAu surface alloy is thermodynamically less favoured, by 23 kJ mol1 or more, than the analogous process on a pure Ni(111) surface."

[7] "A cheaper alternative is to alloy Ni with Sn which hinders the CC bond formation and enhances the CO bond formation leading to the removal of surface C centers as carbon monoxide."

[8] "Since the step sites play an essential role in the growth of the graphene islands, as mentioned above, additives such as potassium,66 sulfur,66 gold66 or boron131 have been proposed.66 Computational calculations have shown that these elements tend to occupy the step sites and thus avoid the formation of graphene islands."

[1] "Regarding the geometric effect, a catalyst design that is based on the alloying of Pt is generally applied. Furthermore, PDH is a structure-insensitive reaction, whereas, side reactions, such as hydrogenolysis, isomerization, and polymerization, are structure-sensitive reactions."

[2] "The ensemble effect can also be maximized by completely isolating the Pt atoms by the second metals, thus favoring the first and second CH scissions, whereas the subsequent CH scission would be successfully inhibited."

[3] "As well as the geometric property, the electronic properties of Pt contribute to the adsorption strength of propylene on the Pt site. For instance, an increase in the electron density of Pt induces its electrostatic repulsion to propylene, thereby promoting propylene desorption and improving stability."

[4] "In this study, we report a novel catalyst design concept, the double decoration of intermetallics, where PtGa was modified with Pb and Ca. This strategy enabled the synergy of the geometric and electronic promotion effects without changing the parent PtGa structure, thereby affording, for the first time, an innovative catalyst with outstandingly high catalytic stability in PDH for up to 1month at 600C."

[5] "Co-feeding H2 drastically decreased coke formation (Figure2b), thereby improving the catalytic stability. PtGaCaPb/SiO2 was barely deactivated for 1 month at least, thus highlighting its much greater stability compared with those of previously reported catalysts"

[1] "To recover the activity completely, the sintered Pt particles must be redispersed. Generally, simple coke burning-off by air cannot realize redispersion, but aggravates the sintering of Pt particles. For the commercial dehydrogenation units using supported Pt catalyst, the spent catalyst is regenerated by air in the presence of a halide (generally, chlorine), the role of which is to redisperse sintered Pt particles."

[2] "The addition of a second metal has been found to be highly effective for the sintering resistance of Pt particles. The introduced metal forms alloys with Pt around Pt particles, and the alloys anchor them on the surface of the carriers, making them not easy to migrate and coalesce."

[3] "The application of the carriers possessing a strong interaction with Pt is another way to retard the sintering. Al2O3 is the most common carrier of Pt catalyst, in which the coordinatively unsaturated pentacoordinate Al3+ can anchor Pt to make it not easy to migrate."

[4] "The Al2O3 overcoat has also proved to be efficient in preventing the sintering of Pt nanoparticles through atomic layer deposition."

[5] "Recently, Pt supported on CeO2 has attracted more attention because of the ability of CeO2 to trap Pt in an atomically dispersed state. The atomically dispersed Pt is most likely to be present in the form of Pt2+ bonded to the ubiquitous step edges of the CeO2 surface."

[6] "To improve the coking resistance of the catalyst is the most effective way to prolong the time between regenerations."

[7] "Introducing a small amount of H2O into the reactor can also reduce coke significantly, but it decreases the conversion due to the competitive adsorption with the feed."

[8] "The monometallic Pt/CeO2 catalyst is very stable even at 800 C, but only catalyzes the CC bond cleavage of hydrocarbons. The addition of Sn to form small PtSn clusters results in a highly selective catalyst in propane dehydrogenation. What is noticeable is that the deactivated PtSn/CeO2 catalyst can be regenerated fully by burning coke without oxychlorination to redisperse Pt."

[9] "To improve the coking resistance of the catalyst, Ba has been introduced. The coverage of surface tetrahedrally coordinated Ga by Ba leads to the decreased coke formation and increased ethylene selectivity."

[1] "Advanced synthesis strategies, including but not limited to ALD and SOMC approaches, are necessary to finely control the structure of Pt- or oxide-based active sites in the DH catalysts."

[2] "By localizing, using proper supports such as oxides and zeolites through the SMSI effect and confinement effect, the subnanometric or SA/SAA Pt-related metal sites exhibit unique catalytic performances in comparison with the larger metal ensembles."

[3] "The electronic properties of metallic Pt and other active metals or metal oxides can be finely modified by the promoters or supports; for instance, the Sn-shifted d-band center of the Pt atom and the N-doped carbon matrix-tuned 3d orbit energy of the single-atom V site consequently reduce the interaction between catalysts and olefin intermediates for the easy desorption of olefin products."

[4] "The geometric modification on the active sites through isolation effects is also useful to prevent the strong adsorption of coke precursors or their polymerization, and thus to reduce the formation of coke species."

[5] "For the selected support, the elimination of the possible active sites responsible for coking is necessary. The alkaline additives are widely used for the oxide-based supports, while the high-silica or pure-silica zeolites are also adopted as the supports, in view of their lower surface acidity."

[6] "Benefiting from the utilization of the high-resolution characterization techniques, e.g., in situ XAS and HAADF-STEM, the effective structural information of the catalysts can be observed allowing us to establish the real relationships between the adsorption and catalytic properties."

[7] "The reaction atmosphere is another factor affecting the formation of coke species, and the co-feeding of steam vapor and hydrogen is a reported method able to reduce the coke amount."

[8] "Although the SMSI effects can effectively stabilize the active sites against the high reaction temperature and reductive atmosphere in the DH reactions, overly strong interactions cause the active metals to be embedded into subsurface, lattice layers or the framework, and therefore reduces the accessibility or even the intrinsic activity of the active sites."

[1] "Many strategies have been suggested to reduce the formation of coke by doping additional promoters including Sn, In, Ga, Mn, Cu and Zn to Pt, which can effectively increase the electron density of Pt atoms and weaken the adsorption of the product alkene, thus reducing coke deposition."

[2] "To improve the stability of Pt-based catalysts, many efforts have been dedicated to strengthen metal–support interactions by using various methods including the nanopore-encaged metal strategy, wet-chemistry approach and modification of supports."

[3] "Herein, highly stable Pt/Sn-Si-beta catalysts were prepared via an improved post-synthesis method and used for PDH, which exhibited high catalytic activity, good selectivity and excellent stability."

[4] "The unique structure of the Pt/Sn-Si-beta catalyst is expected to show good reactivity and stability for PDH."

[5] "The strong Pt–Sn interactions and the confinement effect of Sn in the Si-beta framework inhibit the coke and sintering of Pt clusters, thereby achieving good stability of dehydrogenation and regeneration with almost unchanged catalytic activity during four cycles at 550 °C."

[1] "Many efforts have been made to improve the resistance to coke and to protect the active sites from aggregating, both of which are considered as the main reasons for catalyst deactivation."

[2] "Introduction of transition metal (Zn), alkaline metal (Na, K), alkaline earth metal (Mg, Ca), and rare earth metal (La, Ce), etc. into the catalysts as promotors offered another strategy to enhance the interaction between Pt and Sn and tune the acidbase property simultaneously."

[3] "The redox property, ability of antisintering, and the resistance to coke deposition exhibited integrated effects in achieving better catalytic stability."

[4] "The In additive was helpful to form larger amounts of surface Pt oxides, and it could also promote the reduction of them and stabilize the metallic Pt under the reaction conditions, although the Pt oxides were only partially reduced according to the combined findings from TPR, XPS, and XRD."

[5] "The results showed that such a preparation procedure could efficiently enhance the interaction between the support and Pt, and compared with the sample where Pt and Sn were coimpregnated, the catalytic activity of propane dehydrogenation was therefore improved."

[6] "Ce and In exhibited a super strong ability in stopping the Pt crystallite from growing under the reaction conditions, which evidently occurred over the La- and Fe-promoted catalysts from XRD results."

[7] "The In promotor helped the reaction stabilize in shorter time (3 h) and performed better in the long term catalytic stability test as the conversion lost only 12.8% and the selectivity of propylene was kept nearly constant in maximum of about 99.0% during 33 h time on stream."

[1] "Effectively regulating the active compounds in both Pt-based catalysts and metal oxide-based catalysts can be achieved by soundly introducing promoters."

[2] "Currently, adding metal promoters to form alloys or intermetallic compounds is one of the most effective methods to ameliorate central active components and inhibit catalytic deactivation in Pt-based catalytic systems."

[3] "Introducing another metal oxide to form an oxide compound is an effective approach to improve the dispersion of active species and enhance the catalytic stability under the applied conditions, showing advantages in modifying the coordination and electronic state of host metal oxide sites."

[4] "Another effective approach to improve the dehydrogenation performance is to regulate metal oxides with noble metals."

[5] "Subsurface regulation has been demonstrated as a promising method to tune the adsorptive properties with the aim of enhancing the catalytic performance of metal alloys."

[1] "Adding a promoter such as tin, which dilutes the platinum surface, is a commonly used strategy to boost the platinum catalyst efficiency in the industrial dehydrogenation reaction."

[2] "Further improvement in the platinum utilization efficiency can be achieved by preparing small-sized clusters or even single-atom catalysts using various methods."

[3] "The geometry of the Pt/Cu cluster together with the metallic platinum ensemble stabilized on the top layer of the copper cluster is verified to be responsible for the improvement in the catalytic efficiency."

[4] "The strong bonding interaction between copper and edge BO defects maintained low-crystallized cluster geometry, accordingly promoting both the dispersion and stability of catalytically active species, while the small platinum ensembles stabilized on the top layer of the copper cluster provided accessible platinum ensembles in the metallic state, which are recognized as ideal dehydrogenation sites."

[5] "Different from other supports, h-BN-sheet provides abundant stacking fault edges terminating with the BO defects. These BO defects include unpaired electrons, which can strongly interact with metal active species; meanwhile, the high affinity of the BO defects for electrons helps strengthen the interaction between the metal and support."

[6] "The unique strong bonding interaction between copper and the edge BO defects integrated with metallic platinum ensembles stabilized on the top layer of the copper clusters is the crucial factor that determines the catalytic performance of the Pt/Cu/h-BN-sheet catalyst in the dehydrogenation of propane."

[7] "Herein, we report that a Pt/Cu cluster catalyst containing 100 ppm platinum using hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) nanosheets as a support significantly promotes the catalytic activity (>7 molC3H6 molPt1 s1, 520 C) for the dehydrogenation of propane to propylene."

[1] "Pt-Sn bimetallic catalysts show the above mentioned characteristics to some extent more than the corresponding monometallic Pt catalysts"

[2] "Pt-Sn-SBA-15-IW exhibits higher selectivity to propylene and superior catalyst stability than that of Pt-SBA-15-IW due to weaker adsorption affinity of hydrocarbons on the surface Pt sites in Pt-Sn bimetallic particles."

[3] "Sn results in higher Pt dispersion by alloy formation in Pt-Sn-SBA-15-IW. This leads to the formation of smaller Pt particles in Pt-Sn-SBA-15-IW than in Pt-SBA-15-IW as evidenced by TEM, XRD and H2-chemisorption."

[4] "Sn might have preferentially located at highly coordinatively unsaturated surface Pt sites of bimetallic alloy Pt-Sn particles, as reported previously"

[5] "Sn acts as a scavenger to keep Pt sites clean from coke by draining-off the coke precursors from the vicinity of active sites to the support, which acts as a reservoir for coke deposits."

[6] "The nature and activity properties of surface Pt sites in the catalysts are different due to differences in surface roughness (i.e., surface site heterogeneity) of the particles. Additionally, catalytic properties of Pt sites are influenced by modification of electronic properties of the same sites by Sn in bimetallic PtSn alloy particles (Pt-Sn-SBA-15-IW)."

[1] "Pt-based catalysts are still regarded as the most effective catalysts for PDH process, especially when working with a promoter, such as In, Sn, Ga or Zn, which can further improve propylene selectivity"

[2] "The support materials, Al2O3, SiO2, ZrO2 and zeolite, can also affect catalytic performance on account of the significant differences in textural properties."

[3] "Especially, the Mg(Al)O oxides obtained by calcining hydrotalcite compounds (HT) have been studied extensively during the past years, owing to their suitable acidbase properties, high thermal stability, large surface area and memory effect"

[4] "Many works have been tried to stabilize the HT-based catalysts by combining with graphene networks, growing on metal (Al, Ni) or alloy substrates and loading on oxide materials (γ-Al2O3, ZnO, SnO2)"

[5] "The In0 has been proved to promote the transfer of coke from the active site to the support and the stabilization of the active metal species"

[6] "The formation of meixnerite can adjust the acidbase properties of the catalyst and improve its coke resistance"

[7] "The propane conversion and propylene selectivity of the catalyst reduced with H2/N2 can reach 51% and 97%, respectively, and even stabilize at 45% and 92% after running for 30 h. This is mainly attributable to its high Pt dispersion and In0/In3+ molar ratio, strong PtIn interaction and small metal particle size, which also result in a low content of coke deposits on the surface of the H2/N2-reduced catalyst."

[8] "The smaller metal particles are more active for propane dehydrogenation performance and beneficial to resist the coke deposition"

[9] "As a kind of HT with an interlayer -OH anion, the high crystallinity meixnerite may be helpful to keep the high dispersion and uniform distribution of surface metal active sites during reaction."

[1] "Ceria has wide applications in numerous catalytic processes, including CO oxidation, NOx reduction, and steam reforming. Owing to its high oxygen storage capacity (OSC), CeO2 tends to suppress coke formation using mobile oxygen released from the lattice to oxidize carbon deposits."

[2] "Doping metal cations into ceria is considered to be an effective way to regulate the structural and chemical properties of pure ceria."

[3] "The Ga addition markedly reduces the deactivation rate of catalyst and hence enhances the catalytic stability. The prominent impact of Ga addition is primarily attributed to the formation of PtGa alloys."

[4] "The influence of forming PtGa alloy on the catalytic performance could be attributed to a combination of geometric and electronic effects of metal promoter."

[5] "The enhanced reducibility of CeO2 is indicative of higher capability to eliminate the coke deposition and thus is beneficial to the improvement of catalytic stability."

[6] "We have presented an investigation into doping the Pt/CeO2-Al2O3 catalysts with Ga element to simultaneously enhance the redox property of CeO2 and modify the catalytic property of Pt nanoparticles."

[7] "The addition of Ga improves the catalytic performance of Pt catalysts in PDH, including increasing propylene selectivity and enhancing the catalytic stability."

[8] "The geometric effect of metal promoter contributes to decreasing the size of Pt ensembles or blocking the low-coordinated defect active sites and thereby suppressing the structure-sensitive side reactions, including hydrogenolysis and deep dehydrogenation."

[9] "The electronic effect of promoter is to lower the desorption barrier of alkenes and coke precursors by donating electron to Pt atoms, hindering alkenes adsorption on metal sites and consequently decreasing the likelihood of hydrogenolysis and coking."

[1] "Here we present a new family of very stable, active, and selective catalyst materials for the dehydrogenation of propane to propene based on PtGa/Al2O3."

[2] "A clear synergistic effect is observed between both components, which results in a very stable catalyst material that is highly resistant to deactivation, e.g., by coking."

[3] "Alkali metal dopants, such as K, are known to increase the propene selectivity and decrease coke deposition by poisoning the Brnsted acid sites present in the PDH catalysts."

[4] "When K is present on the catalyst, these sites are poisoned, inhibiting the formation of coke."

[5] "We postulate that the Pt assists in the recombination of the hydrogen atoms on the catalyst, making the active sites available for the following dehydrogenation cycle."

[6] "The catalysts show somewhat higher values for conversion at the start of a dehydrogenation cycle, which then slowly drop during the 15min cycle."

[7] "After the first PDH cycle, the conversion and selectivity of the catalysts does not drop, verifying that the catalysts are not deactivated."

[8] "For the eighth cycle, the values of propane conversion and propene selectivity have dropped for all catalysts. The deactivation is the least severe for those catalysts containing both Pt and Ga."

[9] "Long-term stability experiment with the Pt3GaK catalyst, which was cycled for ca. 150 times over a 14day period. During the first two days both the conversion and selectivity drop, after which the catalyst performance remains stable for 12days on stream."

[10] "As Table1 shows, the presence of K results in less darkening of the catalyst material, due to less coke being deposited."

[11] "The catalyst is highly resistant to coking and remains active for prolonged reaction times."

[1] "Extensive research efforts have been made to inhibit deactivation and improve propene selectivity of Pt-based catalysts by doping promoters of Sn, In, Ga and Cu to form bimetallic catalysts."

[2] "Besides promoters, another method is to modify Al2O3 support with ZnO, La2O3 or TiO2 or replace Al2O3 support with ZnAl2O4, ZSM-5 or Mg(Al)O oxide."

[3] "Additionally, it has been verified that the single Pt atom sites on Pt-Sn/γ-Al2O3 with a sandwich structure are more favorable for PDH reaction than Pt ensembles."

[4] "Given that the small Pt NPs and hierarchical microstructure may provide more stable and easily accessible active sites for PDH reaction, a promising design for obtaining the desired size of active Pt and hierarchical pore morphology was proposed."

[5] "The ball-flower-like PtIn/Mg(Al)O catalyst exhibited high activity, excellent propene selectivity and superior durability as well as excellent resistance to the carbon deposition and Pt-sintering in the propane dehydrogenation to propene, which were mainly arising from its multi-level hierarchical microstructure with low specific surface area, and a large amount of strong and stable PtIn interactions."

[1] "We developed a PDH catalyst that operates at thermodynamically limited conversion levels without the addition of hydrogen to the feed and exhibits excellent stability and selectivity to propylene (>99%). The catalyst is composed of silica-supported Pt1Sn1 NPs, synthesized and pretreated to ensure that the mixing of Pt and Sn is preserved during catalytic operation."

          [2] "The principle behind catalyst synthesis is to begin with a heterometallic Pt-Sn coordination complex in which Pt and Sn are in immediate contact, and this interaction is retained during the reduction and PDH reaction."

          [3] "This catalyst has three main features: (i) The PtSn NPs form an atomically mixed Pt-Sn precursor. (ii) Upon reduction, very small (less than 2 nm diameter) intermetallic PtSn NPs form. (iii) A benign interaction of these NPs with the SiO2 support avoids segregation of Pt and Sn and formation of a SnOx phase."

          [4] "We hypothesized that the performance and stability of the Pt1Sn1/SiO2 catalyst was derived from favorable interactions among the support (SiO2), promoter (Sn), and active metal (Pt), which allowed for a high degree of atomic mixing of Pt and Sn within very small intermetallic PtSn NPs."

          [5] "Even under these harsh, high-conversion and undiluted propane stream conditions, the Pt1Sn1/SiO2 catalyst was stable and operated at the thermodynamic conversion limit and >99% selectivity for at least 30 hours on stream, whereas the PtSn/γ-Al2O3 (commercial mimic) deactivated rapidly under these conditions"

          [6] "To alleviate this issue, large quantities of Sn are used in the catalyst preparation (the nominal atomic loading is Sn:Pt between 4 and 5), which increases the yield of intermetallic PtSn NPs (12). In addition, studies have shown that adding hydrogen to the reactant feed reduces the rate of catalyst deactivation (13)."

[1] "The addition of a second metal, such as tin, indium, or gallium, to platinum has been found to be effective in increasing ethene selectivity and suppressing coke formation"

[2] "Both geometric and electronic effects of the second metals have been proposed to explain their roles in modifying the catalyst surface and changing the surface chemistry involved in ethane dehydrogenation"

[3] "Deactivation decreased significantly with decreasing particle size and increasing Sn addition."

[4] "Operating at low residence time resulted in significantly lowered deactivation, attributable to lower coke formation from ethene, and allowed for measurement closer to the true initial activity."

[5] "For a fixed average particle size, the TOF and selectivity of these catalysts for ethene production increased with the content of Sn. These trends are attributed to a combination of geometric and electronic effects brought about by the presence of Sn on the surface of Pt nanoparticles"

[6] "Carbon deposition decreases with decreasing metal particle size and increasing Sn/Pt ratio."

[7] "To produce PtSn bimetallic particles, tin acetylacetonate (Sn(acac)2, 99.9%, Aldrich) was added together with Pt(acac)2 at the start of the procedure."

[8] "TOF was also found to increase with increasing particle size, a trend attributed to differences in the fraction of lower-coordinated surface atoms and in the electronic properties of the particles."

[9] "While ethane dehydrogenation may favor flatter surfaces, the gain in TOF is not significant enough to lose surface area by going to larger particles. Additionally, practical implementation of this system at high conversions suggests that small and Sn-promoted catalysts should be used to avoid coke formation."

[1] "To address this coke-induced deactivation, a regeneration step under an oxidative atmosphere has been incorporated to industrial dehydrogenation processes. This process is relatively straightforward, as coke is easily combusted in air at dehydrogenation reaction temperatures."

[2] "Several strategies have been applied to control coke formation. For example, coke deposition can be dramatically reduced by using a support with little to no Brnsted acidity, or by poisoning the acid sites. Changes in the reaction conditions, such as cofeeding steam, hydrogen, or CO2, can reduce coke formation, whereas high partial pressures of olefins and paraffins exacerbate coke deposition."

[3] "Alternatively, coke deposition can be reduced by adding a promoter element, the addition of Sn to Pt-based dehydrogenation catalysts being the best-known example."

[4] "The addition of Sn to the Pt-based catalyst facilitates this migration by weakening the binding of the hydrocarbon to the metal."

[5] "Tin is by far the most studied promoter, and all of the platinum-based catalyst formulations that are industrially applied include this post-transition metal, the addition of which modifies both the platinum active phase and the support. Essentially, Sn suppresses hydrogenolysis and isomerization reactions, minimizes metal sintering, neutralizes the acidity of the support, and facilitates the diffusion of the coke species from the metal surface to the support."

[6] "The addition of alkaline metals, such as Li, Na, and K, poisons these acid sites, suppressing the formation of coke on the support as shown in Figure 10."

[7] "Operando spectroscopy will provide the means for more sophisticated process control. Indeed, Raman/UVvis spectroscopy can be used to monitor noninvasively the amount and type of coke as the latter forms and accumulates on the catalyst surface."

[8] "An alternative solution lies in the use of solid oxygen carriers, such as CeO2, SbO4, In2O3, WO3, PbOx, Tl2O3, and BiO3, capable of selectively oxidizing the hydrogen evolved by the SHC reaction."

[9] "Another method of removing the hydrogen from the reaction mixture is the introduction of membranes to the reactor system. This approach allows hydrogen to diffuse out of the reactor, shifting the equilibrium toward the desired olefin product."

[1] "CoOx within dealuminated Beta (SiBeta) zeolite developing into ultrasmall-sized Co particles under H2 or reactant gas is highly efficient for catalyzing direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) to propylene reaction."

[2] "The dealumination of Beta zeolite developed by Dzwigaj et al. is a good way to further modify its structural and acidic properties, since the created T-vacant sites and low acidity are beneficial for many catalytic reactions"

[3] "After prereduction under optimum conditions, the 0.5CoSiBeta catalyst (Co loading is 0.5 wt%) showed propane conversion as high as 72% with propylene selectivity of around 92%."

[4] "The CoSiBeta catalysts with or without prereduction treatments show similar catalytic performance but different induction periods, implying that the metallic Co formed in situ during the reaction are the active sites."

[5] "After completion of the previous run, the catalysts were calcinated for 2 h in air at 600 C to remove the deposited coke for the next cycle without another reduction treatment. The catalytic activities of the regenerated 0.5CoSiBeta are almost the same as that obtained with the fresh catalyst over four cycles, indicating that deactivation is caused mainly by carbon deposits instead of sintering of cobalt."

[6] "Sulfate addition could lead to improved catalytic performance by dispersing cobalt species well and restraining the reduction to metallic Co"

[7] "Noticeably, the very weak acidity may be responsible for its superior propylene selectivity by boosting the propylene desorption."

[1] "Sn is often added to alter the product distribution for hydrocarbon conversion through the inhibition of hydrogenolysis, isomerisation, cracking and coke formation, thereby enhancing the catalyst selectivity and stability"

[2] "The presence of Sn as a promoter drastically improves the catalytic behavior. The PtSn/Al2O3 catalyst material possesses both a higher propane conversion and propene selectivity, which is maintained throughout the duration of the first dehydrogenation step."

[3] "The presence of Sn not only modifies the electronic properties of the Pt nanoparticles and therefore the activation of propane but also produces a drain-off effect. This drain-off effect keeps the Pt sites clean by removing the coke precursors from the vicinity of active sites to the support."

[4] "Kumar et al. proposed a modified drain-off effect, which is based on a combination of the electronic and drain-off effects."

[5] "It suggests that coke precursors such as olefinic species adsorb less strongly on the PtSn bimetallic catalyst due to an ensemble effect of Sn. Therefore, coke precursors are mobile and easily migrate to the support where they finally deposit as coke."

[1] "Extensive investigations have been performed to improve the catalytic performance and stability of Pt-based catalysts for PDH. The addition of promoters such as Sn, La, Ga and Zn species has been reported to be effective."

[2] "The addition of promoters is reported to facilitate propylene desorption in the bimetallic PtZn/Al2O3 catalyst and the metalmetal interaction is recognized as the origin of the enhanced performance in propane dehydrogenation."

[3] "PtCu/Al2O3 was examined by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and infrared spectroscopy of CO and propylene adsorption (CO-IR and C3H6-IR) to understand the interaction between Cu addition and the active sites of Pt."

[4] "The Cu addition results in an enhancement in propylene selectivity and catalyst stability, where PtCu0.5/Al2O3 exhibits the highest propylene selectivity with the lowest deactivation rate."

[5] "The Cu promoter plays a significant role in the reaction of PDH by inducing the metal interaction between Pt and Cu, which is the primary origin of the enhanced propylene selectivity and anti-coking ability of the PtCu/Al2O3 catalyst."

[6] "The facile desorption of propylene from the PtCu/Al2O3 catalyst guarantees the high propylene selectivity by diminishing the possibility of polymerization reactions for coke formation and other undesired side reactions such as thermal cracking reactions forming lighter hydrocarbons."

[7] "Zhang et al. studied a PtSn/ZSM-5 catalyst and inferred that Sn could change the interfacial characteristics between the Pt metal and the ZSM-5 support, which facilitated the desorption of carbon deposits from metal clusters to the carrier, resulting in improved stability."

[8] "An enhanced catalytic performance of a zinc-doped platinum catalyst was reported by Yu et al. The weakened adsorption of propylene on the metal surface of PtZn/Al2O3, caused by the change of electronic environment of Pt, was proposed as the reason for the good anti-coking ability and high propylene selectivity."

[1] "The optimal 10Zn0.1Pt/HZ catalyst (consisting of 1000 ppm Pt and 10 wt% Zn) shows a high propylene yield (about 46%) and extraordinary dehydrogenation stability over 65 h at 525 C without any regeneration procedure or H2 as auxiliary gas."

[2] "It is revealed that this catalyst has two kinds of active centers which work corporately: (i) Lewis acidic sites created by framework Zn species and (ii) small-sized PtZn particles."

[3] "The stable state of the active species and strong carbon resistance of 10Zn0.1Pt/HZ related to the interaction effect between Pt and Zn are confirmed, accounting for the admirable reaction stability of PDH."

[4] "Both the small-sized PtZn particles and Lewis acidic framework Zn species make contributions to the high catalytic activity of PDH, following a metalacid bifunctional mechanism, and a balance between the metal and acid functions can be realized on the 10Zn0.1Pt/HZ catalyst."

[5] "The surface interactions between Pt and Zn are revealed by the H2-TPR and XPS measurements, leading to the strong coke resistance and the stable state of Pt and Zn of 10Zn0.1Pt/HZ which are responsible for the ultra-stable activity for PDH over 65 h at 525 C."

[6] "As a result, the supported Zn and a trace amount of Pt work corporately and result in high catalytic activity and great stability at 525 C, and this sheds a bright light on the design of other hyperstable dehydrogenation catalysts."

[7] "A high Zn/Pt ratio can lead to high dispersion and great thermal stability of metal phases"

[8] "The synergistic effect between Pt and Zn is proved by the H2-TPR results, in which the co-reduction peak of partial Pt and Zn is in between the reduction temperatures of platinum oxides and zinc oxides."

[1] "Pt-based catalysts are widely used in propane dehydrogenation reaction for the production of propylene. Suppressing irreversible deactivation caused by the sintering of Pt particles under harsh conditions and regeneration process is a significant challenge in this catalyst."

[2] "The coordinatively unsaturated pentacoordinate Al3+ (Al3+penta) can strongly anchor Pt atoms via a formation of Al-O-Pt bond, and thus stabilize the Pt-based particles at the surface of Al2O3."

[3] "The stability and regenerability of Pt-Sn2/meso-Al2O3 are strongly dependent on the content of Al3+penta sites in the Al2O3 structure, and a high level of Al3+penta sites can effectively prevent the agglomeration of Pt-Sn2 clusters into large Pt nanoparticles in the consecutive dehydrogenation-regeneration cycles."

[4] "The Pt-Sn2/meso-Al2O3-600 with the highest level of Al3+penta (50.8%) delivers the best performance in propane dehydrogenation, which exhibits propane conversion of 40% and propylene selectivity above 98% at 570 C with 10 vol% C3H8 and 10 vol% H2 feed."

[5] "A slow deactivation in this catalyst is ascribed to the formation of coke, and the catalytic performance can be fully restored in the consecutive dehydrogenation-regeneration cycles via a simple calcination treatment."

[1] "Zeolites with well-defined microporous channel structures and excellent thermal stability are considered as ideal supports for stabilizing metal species. In particular, zeolite-encaged metal catalysts possess unique and remarkable catalytic stability, which is very attractive in heterogeneous catalysis"

[2] "Recently, Pt and PtM catalysts (M = Zn, Sn) have been encapsulated into zeolites, and the reports have shown that the zeolite-encapsulated supported catalysts with excellent stability are valuable in practical applications"

[3] "Herein, highly dispersed Ga-Pt bimetallic clusters encapsulated within a purely siliceous silicalite-1 zeolite (S-1, MFI zeotype) were prepared by an in situ method of hydrothermal process and subsequent ligand-protected direct H2 reduction."

[4] "Notably, the resulting GaPt@S-1 catalyst displays excellent catalytic performance and high stability during PDH."

[1] "The anti-coking ability and propylene selectivity can be enhanced by alloying Pt with Cu, Sn, Ga, In, Ge, etc. via combined geometric and electronic effects."

          [2] "From the geometric perspective, low coordinated surface Pt atoms such as step sites are more active but less selective. With the addition of Sn, the steps of Pt3Sn become inert, because the steps tend to be decorated with Sn, thus they suppress further dehydrogenation of propylene and coke formation."

          [3] "The introduction of Sn downshifts the d-band center of surface Pt atoms which lowers the binding strength of propylene, promotes its desorption and results in higher propylene selectivity."

          [4] "The geometric role of In is not only separating the Pt atoms, but also covering the step Pt atoms while the electronic effect can be attributed to the electron transfer from In to Pt."

          [5] "The geometric effect of In is attributed to the creation of separated Pt atoms, which leads to the transformation from strong di-σ propylene adsorption mode to weak π adsorption mode. Moreover, the In atoms will cover low coordinated Pt atoms that tend to cause further dehydrogenation."

          [6] "The surface enriched Sn divides large surface Pt ensembles into small pieces, which can further suppress the CC scission step, since it normally requires larger Pt ensembles than CH dissociation."

[1] "We synthesize γ-alumina-supported platinum/copper SAA catalysts by incipient wetness co-impregnation method with a high copper to platinum ratio."

[2] "Single platinum atoms dispersed on copper nanoparticles dramatically enhance the desorption of surface-bounded propylene and prohibit its further dehydrogenation, resulting in high propylene selectivity (90%)."

[3] "Unlike previous reported SAA applications at low temperatures (<400C), Pt/Cu SAA shows excellent stability of more than 120h of operation under atmospheric pressure at 520C."

[4] "Our DFT calculations suggest that Pt/Cu SAA indeed breaks the PtM alloy scaling relationship, which is different from the scaling for conventional Pt alloys during the PDH"

[5] "The Pt/Cu SAA catalyst with the low loading of Pt (0.1wt%) displays propylene selectivity of 90% with the high formation rate of 10.6molg1Pth1 under the conditions of atmospheric pressure, 520C, WHSV=4h1, C3H8/N2=1/1 and shows excellent stability for at least 120h on stream."

[6] "Herein, we report that Pt/Cu single atom alloy (SAA) breaks the PtM alloy scaling relationship during the PDH, with a great improvement of propylene selectivity and a slight loss of intrinsic dehydrogenation activity."

[7] "During the PDH at 520C, the propylene formation rate dramatically dropped from 3.7 to 1.6molg1Pth1 for 0.1Pt/Al2O3 after 12h on stream. As a contrast, we did not observe deactivation for 0.1Pt10Cu/Al2O3 upon 12h on stream and the propylene formation rate only slightly decreased from 10.6 to 10.3molg1Pth1 even after 120h on stream."

[8] "The low deactivation rate of 0.0005h−1 for 0.1Pt10Cu/Al2O3 quantitatively demonstrates its high stability when compared to 0.07h−1 for 0.1Pt/Al2O3"

[9] "The variation trend of CO adsorption behavior is highly consistent with that of the initial activities of the catalysts as the Cu content increases."

[1] "To alleviate these problems, Sn is introduced to form an alloy with Pt nanoparticles and thereby dilute the Pt surface with inactive Sn atoms and break up coke-generating Pt ensembles."

[2] "Our search for a highly active and more durable PDH catalyst has focused on using a siliceous MFI zeolite with a hierarchical micro-/mesoporous structure as a replacement for the alumina support."

[3] "We incorporated La and Y along with Pt into this mesoporous zeolite to improve the Pt catalyst dispersion, as these rare-earth element (REE) oxides are known for their strong metalsupport interactions with Pt that stabilize the latter in the form of small nanoparticles"

[4] "We intentionally generated silanol nests by synthesizing a mesoporous gallosilicate zeolite and subsequently removing the framework Ga atoms using nitric acid"

[5] "The formation of the Pt3La and Pt3Y nanoparticles on the degallated zeolite brought a striking enhancement in all aspects of the PDH catalytic performance, including activity, selectivity and durability"

[6] "The high PDH catalytic performance of PtLa/mz-deGa and PtY/mz-deGa can be ascribed to the critical role of surface silanol nests that enabled atomistic alloying of La and Y into Pt nanoparticles."

[1] "Pt is the most versatile noble metal catalyst for alkane reactions. Although Pt is expensive, the choice of Pt is often justified by its higher activity, stability and selectivity for these reactions compared to less expensive alternative transition metals."

[2] "Waku et al. exploited the unique property of zeolite as a support for achieving high metal dispersion through cation exchange sites to create a Pt/Na[Fe]-ZSM-5 catalyst with outstanding stability for dehydrogenation of light alkanes."

[3] "They found that the catalyst deactivation rate of Pt/Na[Fe]-ZSM-5 was lower than for any other Pt-based catalysts in refractory oxide support. The unprecedented performance of Pt/Na[Fe]-ZSM-5 was attributed to its high Pt dispersion (cluster size < 1 mm) on zeolite through ion-exchange."

[4] "There is a tendency to generate some Brnsted protons on the zeolite during the exchange process, but the choice of Fe3+ as an isomorphous cation in place of Al3+ led to weaker Brnsted sites in [Fe]-ZSM compared to [Al]-ZSM. The weaker acidity minimizes the tendency of side reactions (cracking of oligomerization, aromatisation, and coke), which translates into higher alkene selectivity and catalyst stability."

[5] "Promotion of Pt with metals, such as Sn, Ga, Zn, Re, etc., improves catalyst stability, but also leads to faster deactivation rates than Pt/Na[Fe]-ZSM-5."

[6] "Recent reports by Bell et al. show that the use of calcined hydrotalcite (Al/Mg  0.1) supported on bimetallic PtGa or PtSn gave very high alkene selectivity and stability, comparable to Pt/Na[Fe]-ZSM-5."

[7] "Elimination of the proton sites of zeolites is critical for obtaining a high alkene selectivity and stability in dehydrogenation catalysts."

[1] "Alloying of Pt with one or more TMs, such as Sn, Ti, Ga, Cu, Co, Zn, Ir, and In, is an effective way to improve the catalytic performance in PDH."

[2] "The addition of Sn into Pt(111) can lower the energy barrier for propylene desorption and simultaneously increase the activation energy for propylene dehydrogenation"

[3] "The dopants can promote the dispersion of Pt particles and thus prevent their sintering, suppress the structure-sensitive side reactions including hydrogenolysis and deep dehydrogenation to reduce the rate of carbon deposition, and promote the migration of carbon deposition from active metal components to the carrier, etc."

[4] "Selecting suitable catalyst supports is also an effective way to modify the catalytic performance of metal catalysts for PDH."

[5] "The addition of an appropriate amount of TiO2 in Pt/TiO2Al2O3 catalysts can improve propylene selectivity and catalyst stability. The reasons are that the electrons could be transferred from the partially reduced TiOx (x < 2) to the Pt atoms, and the partial coverage of the metal surface by TiOx species, and thus the increased electron density of Pt can hinder propylene adsorption on active metal sites and facilitate coke migration from the active sites to the carrier."

[6] "Atomic layer deposition (ALD) of alumina on Pt step edge sites significantly suppresses unselective deep dehydrogenation and coke formation"

[7] "Some novel coreshell Pt-based catalysts can not only improve the catalytic performance but also effectively increase the utilization efficiency of precious metals."

[8] "The addition of Sn can help Pt re-disperse in the catalyst regeneration by providing nucleation sites on the γ-Al2O3 surface to achieve superior catalyst stability."

[1] "VOx/ZrO2, a well-known catalyst for ODH, has a much more superior PDH performance than commonly used VOx/Al2O3. The turnover frequency (TOF) is six times higher by loading VOx on ZrO2 than on Al2O3."

[2] "Combining H2-temperature programmed reduction, in situ Raman spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and theoretical studies, we find that the interaction between VOx and ZrO2 can facilitate the reduction of VO bonds, including VO, VOV and VOZr."

[3] "The promoting effect could be attributed to the formation of low coordinated V species in VOx/ZrO2 which is more active in CH activation."

[4] "We performed 120 min of the on stream reaction and studied the reaction–regeneration cycles over 1VZr (Fig. S2b and S3). The propane conversion and propylene selectivity exhibit little change during six cycles, implying outstanding regeneration stability."

[5] "Alternatively, supported vanadium oxide is a promising catalyst compared with Pt and CrOx for its competitive performance, low cost and low toxicity."

[6] "We propose the enhanced CH activation on VZr results from the facile reduction of VO, VOV and VOZr bonds, thus producing deeply reduced and lower coordinated V species."

[7] "It is generally accepted that the support could affect reactivity by stabilizing the active sites and/or altering the electron state of active sites."

[8] "Considering the dramatic performance achieved through the interaction between VOx and ZrO2, our work provides a new insight into high-performance VOx-based catalysts for propane dehydrogenation."

[1] "When Sn is added to a Pt/Al2O3 catalyst, the Ptalkene interaction is weakened and side reactions are suppressed [13,14,15,16,17]. Thus, Sn may enhance the propylene selectivity of the PDH reaction [18,19]."

[2] "It has also been reported that Sn plays important roles in preventing Pt sintering, lowering the acidity of the oxide support, and removing the coke generated during the PDH process [4,20]."

[3] "Deng and coworkers [10,21,22] used a direct reduction method to prepare PDH catalysts, which did not include a calcination step, unlike the conventional protocol for catalyst preparation involving drying, calcination, and reduction."

[4] "The direct reduction method yielded a catalyst with much higher performance than the conventionally calcined catalyst considering propane conversion, as well as propylene selectivity."

[5] "We suspect that the interaction between propane and the PtSn alloys is greater for the Pt3Sn alloy than the PtSn alloy. Thus, the greater number of interactions enhances the PDH reaction and more coke is formed."

[6] "When coke accumulates, the metal sites become covered, which could inhibit the PDH reaction. If drain-off occurs, the active sites of catalysts are recovered."

[7] "Zhu et al. [9] reported a Sn-surface-enriched PtSn bimetallic nanoparticle catalyst prepared on a MgAl2O4 support using an organometallic chemistry concept, and the catalyst exhibited high selectivity and stability during the PDH reaction."

[8] "In our previous study [23], we reported that oxychlorination treatment was effective in regenerating PtSn/Al2O3 catalysts after the PDH reaction, and we observed that catalysts containing Pt3Sn alloys after oxychlorination treatment showed improved PDH activity."

[9] "As shown in Figure 2, the propylene selectivity values determined after 1 h were in the order of SR500 > SR550 > SR600 > Cal600 > SR450 > SR800 > SR900."

[10] "We can propose that the synergistic effect of the interaction of Pt and Sn covering the surface of Pt, as well as the accessible Pt sites, could improve the dehydrogenation performance of the catalyst prepared by the direct reduction method."

[1] "The modification of metal oxides by noble metals has been proved to be an effective strategy to improve the low reactivity of metal oxides in catalyzing PDH."

[2] "Researchers have proposed various regulatory mechanisms of noble metals on metal oxides. Gong and co-workers revealed that ZnO was promoted to be a stronger Lewis acid through the electron transfer from metal oxide to Pt, which attenuated the reduction of ZnO and enhanced the stability."

[3] "Kondratenko and co-workers suggested that low hydrogen adsorption energy barrier on Rh was favorable for H2 dissociation into H atoms and spillover onto the surface of ZrO2. Thus, the lattice oxygen was removed from ZrO2 to generate more coordinately unsaturated Zr4+ sites for PDH reaction."

[4] "With trace amounts (<0.15wt%) of noble metals, PDH reaction performance on zirconia can be enhanced prominently."

[5] "The low deactivation rate (kd=0.03h1) at 550C demonstrates its high stability"

[6] "Optimally, 0.03Pt3Ga2O3 catalyst obtains about 97mmolg1h1 of propylene formation rate, which exceeds 25% of the summed contribution of individual 0.03Pt and 3Ga2O3, and achieves the most noticeable synergistic effect."

[7] "The presence of Pt promotes H2 dissociation and surface coverage of hydrogen species, which is beneficial for the activation of CH in propane."

[8] "Weckhuysen and co-workers4a have found that with 1000ppm Pt modification, propane conversion was doubled in comparison with pure Ga2O3."

[1] "Although supported Pt catalysts show high activity, the catalyst deactivation due to coke formation remains a challenging issue."

[2] "The robustness against coking can be increased with additional promoters, such as late transition metals, main-group metals including Sn and Ga, alkali-metal oxides and rare-earth metal oxides."

[3] "Previous experimental studies have shown that the selectivity towards propylene during propane dehydrogenation on Pt particles can be increased by alloying late transition metals or main-group metals such as Cu and Sn."

[4] "DFT calculations indicate that the binding energy of propylene is weakened by at least 8 kJ mol1 after alloying different amounts of Sn in Pt(111). Meanwhile, all the dehydrogenation barriers shift up, including deep dehydrogenation from propylene."

[5] "Calculations have shown that these elements tend to occupy the step sites and thus avoid the formation of graphene islands."

[6] "Different approaches have been proposed to encounter the coking problem. It could be shown that the adsorption of C atoms on the closed packed surface of a NiAu surface alloy is thermodynamically less favoured, by 23 kJ mol1 or more, than the analogous process on a pure Ni(111) surface."

[7] "A cheaper alternative is to alloy Ni with Sn which hinders the CC bond formation and enhances the CO bond formation leading to the removal of surface C centers as carbon monoxide."

[8] "Since the step sites play an essential role in the growth of the graphene islands, as mentioned above, additives such as potassium,66 sulfur,66 gold66 or boron131 have been proposed.66 Computational calculations have shown that these elements tend to occupy the step sites and thus avoid the formation of graphene islands."

[1] "Regarding the geometric effect, a catalyst design that is based on the alloying of Pt is generally applied. Furthermore, PDH is a structure-insensitive reaction, whereas, side reactions, such as hydrogenolysis, isomerization, and polymerization, are structure-sensitive reactions."

[2] "The ensemble effect can also be maximized by completely isolating the Pt atoms by the second metals, thus favoring the first and second CH scissions, whereas the subsequent CH scission would be successfully inhibited."

[3] "As well as the geometric property, the electronic properties of Pt contribute to the adsorption strength of propylene on the Pt site. For instance, an increase in the electron density of Pt induces its electrostatic repulsion to propylene, thereby promoting propylene desorption and improving stability."

[4] "In this study, we report a novel catalyst design concept, the double decoration of intermetallics, where PtGa was modified with Pb and Ca. This strategy enabled the synergy of the geometric and electronic promotion effects without changing the parent PtGa structure, thereby affording, for the first time, an innovative catalyst with outstandingly high catalytic stability in PDH for up to 1month at 600C."

[5] "Co-feeding H2 drastically decreased coke formation (Figure2b), thereby improving the catalytic stability. PtGaCaPb/SiO2 was barely deactivated for 1 month at least, thus highlighting its much greater stability compared with those of previously reported catalysts"

[1] "To recover the activity completely, the sintered Pt particles must be redispersed. Generally, simple coke burning-off by air cannot realize redispersion, but aggravates the sintering of Pt particles. For the commercial dehydrogenation units using supported Pt catalyst, the spent catalyst is regenerated by air in the presence of a halide (generally, chlorine), the role of which is to redisperse sintered Pt particles."

[2] "The addition of a second metal has been found to be highly effective for the sintering resistance of Pt particles. The introduced metal forms alloys with Pt around Pt particles, and the alloys anchor them on the surface of the carriers, making them not easy to migrate and coalesce."

[3] "The application of the carriers possessing a strong interaction with Pt is another way to retard the sintering. Al2O3 is the most common carrier of Pt catalyst, in which the coordinatively unsaturated pentacoordinate Al3+ can anchor Pt to make it not easy to migrate."

[4] "The Al2O3 overcoat has also proved to be efficient in preventing the sintering of Pt nanoparticles through atomic layer deposition."

[5] "Recently, Pt supported on CeO2 has attracted more attention because of the ability of CeO2 to trap Pt in an atomically dispersed state. The atomically dispersed Pt is most likely to be present in the form of Pt2+ bonded to the ubiquitous step edges of the CeO2 surface."

[6] "To improve the coking resistance of the catalyst is the most effective way to prolong the time between regenerations."

[7] "Introducing a small amount of H2O into the reactor can also reduce coke significantly, but it decreases the conversion due to the competitive adsorption with the feed."

[8] "The monometallic Pt/CeO2 catalyst is very stable even at 800 C, but only catalyzes the CC bond cleavage of hydrocarbons. The addition of Sn to form small PtSn clusters results in a highly selective catalyst in propane dehydrogenation. What is noticeable is that the deactivated PtSn/CeO2 catalyst can be regenerated fully by burning coke without oxychlorination to redisperse Pt."

[9] "To improve the coking resistance of the catalyst, Ba has been introduced. The coverage of surface tetrahedrally coordinated Ga by Ba leads to the decreased coke formation and increased ethylene selectivity."

[1] "Advanced synthesis strategies, including but not limited to ALD and SOMC approaches, are necessary to finely control the structure of Pt- or oxide-based active sites in the DH catalysts."

[2] "By localizing, using proper supports such as oxides and zeolites through the SMSI effect and confinement effect, the subnanometric or SA/SAA Pt-related metal sites exhibit unique catalytic performances in comparison with the larger metal ensembles."

[3] "The electronic properties of metallic Pt and other active metals or metal oxides can be finely modified by the promoters or supports; for instance, the Sn-shifted d-band center of the Pt atom and the N-doped carbon matrix-tuned 3d orbit energy of the single-atom V site consequently reduce the interaction between catalysts and olefin intermediates for the easy desorption of olefin products."

[4] "The geometric modification on the active sites through isolation effects is also useful to prevent the strong adsorption of coke precursors or their polymerization, and thus to reduce the formation of coke species."

[5] "For the selected support, the elimination of the possible active sites responsible for coking is necessary. The alkaline additives are widely used for the oxide-based supports, while the high-silica or pure-silica zeolites are also adopted as the supports, in view of their lower surface acidity."

[6] "Benefiting from the utilization of the high-resolution characterization techniques, e.g., in situ XAS and HAADF-STEM, the effective structural information of the catalysts can be observed allowing us to establish the real relationships between the adsorption and catalytic properties."

[7] "The reaction atmosphere is another factor affecting the formation of coke species, and the co-feeding of steam vapor and hydrogen is a reported method able to reduce the coke amount."

[8] "Although the SMSI effects can effectively stabilize the active sites against the high reaction temperature and reductive atmosphere in the DH reactions, overly strong interactions cause the active metals to be embedded into subsurface, lattice layers or the framework, and therefore reduces the accessibility or even the intrinsic activity of the active sites."

[1] "Many strategies have been suggested to reduce the formation of coke by doping additional promoters including Sn, In, Ga, Mn, Cu and Zn to Pt, which can effectively increase the electron density of Pt atoms and weaken the adsorption of the product alkene, thus reducing coke deposition."

[2] "To improve the stability of Pt-based catalysts, many efforts have been dedicated to strengthen metal–support interactions by using various methods including the nanopore-encaged metal strategy, wet-chemistry approach and modification of supports."

[3] "Herein, highly stable Pt/Sn-Si-beta catalysts were prepared via an improved post-synthesis method and used for PDH, which exhibited high catalytic activity, good selectivity and excellent stability."

[4] "The unique structure of the Pt/Sn-Si-beta catalyst is expected to show good reactivity and stability for PDH."

[5] "The strong Pt–Sn interactions and the confinement effect of Sn in the Si-beta framework inhibit the coke and sintering of Pt clusters, thereby achieving good stability of dehydrogenation and regeneration with almost unchanged catalytic activity during four cycles at 550 °C."

[1] "Many efforts have been made to improve the resistance to coke and to protect the active sites from aggregating, both of which are considered as the main reasons for catalyst deactivation."

[2] "Introduction of transition metal (Zn), alkaline metal (Na, K), alkaline earth metal (Mg, Ca), and rare earth metal (La, Ce), etc. into the catalysts as promotors offered another strategy to enhance the interaction between Pt and Sn and tune the acidbase property simultaneously."

[3] "The redox property, ability of antisintering, and the resistance to coke deposition exhibited integrated effects in achieving better catalytic stability."

[4] "The In additive was helpful to form larger amounts of surface Pt oxides, and it could also promote the reduction of them and stabilize the metallic Pt under the reaction conditions, although the Pt oxides were only partially reduced according to the combined findings from TPR, XPS, and XRD."

[5] "The results showed that such a preparation procedure could efficiently enhance the interaction between the support and Pt, and compared with the sample where Pt and Sn were coimpregnated, the catalytic activity of propane dehydrogenation was therefore improved."

[6] "Ce and In exhibited a super strong ability in stopping the Pt crystallite from growing under the reaction conditions, which evidently occurred over the La- and Fe-promoted catalysts from XRD results."

[7] "The In promotor helped the reaction stabilize in shorter time (3 h) and performed better in the long term catalytic stability test as the conversion lost only 12.8% and the selectivity of propylene was kept nearly constant in maximum of about 99.0% during 33 h time on stream."

[1] "Effectively regulating the active compounds in both Pt-based catalysts and metal oxide-based catalysts can be achieved by soundly introducing promoters."

[2] "Currently, adding metal promoters to form alloys or intermetallic compounds is one of the most effective methods to ameliorate central active components and inhibit catalytic deactivation in Pt-based catalytic systems."

[3] "Introducing another metal oxide to form an oxide compound is an effective approach to improve the dispersion of active species and enhance the catalytic stability under the applied conditions, showing advantages in modifying the coordination and electronic state of host metal oxide sites."

[4] "Another effective approach to improve the dehydrogenation performance is to regulate metal oxides with noble metals."

[5] "Subsurface regulation has been demonstrated as a promising method to tune the adsorptive properties with the aim of enhancing the catalytic performance of metal alloys."

[1] "Adding a promoter such as tin, which dilutes the platinum surface, is a commonly used strategy to boost the platinum catalyst efficiency in the industrial dehydrogenation reaction."

[2] "Further improvement in the platinum utilization efficiency can be achieved by preparing small-sized clusters or even single-atom catalysts using various methods."

[3] "The geometry of the Pt/Cu cluster together with the metallic platinum ensemble stabilized on the top layer of the copper cluster is verified to be responsible for the improvement in the catalytic efficiency."

[4] "The strong bonding interaction between copper and edge BO defects maintained low-crystallized cluster geometry, accordingly promoting both the dispersion and stability of catalytically active species, while the small platinum ensembles stabilized on the top layer of the copper cluster provided accessible platinum ensembles in the metallic state, which are recognized as ideal dehydrogenation sites."

[5] "Different from other supports, h-BN-sheet provides abundant stacking fault edges terminating with the BO defects. These BO defects include unpaired electrons, which can strongly interact with metal active species; meanwhile, the high affinity of the BO defects for electrons helps strengthen the interaction between the metal and support."

[6] "The unique strong bonding interaction between copper and the edge BO defects integrated with metallic platinum ensembles stabilized on the top layer of the copper clusters is the crucial factor that determines the catalytic performance of the Pt/Cu/h-BN-sheet catalyst in the dehydrogenation of propane."

[7] "Herein, we report that a Pt/Cu cluster catalyst containing 100 ppm platinum using hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) nanosheets as a support significantly promotes the catalytic activity (>7 molC3H6 molPt1 s1, 520 C) for the dehydrogenation of propane to propylene."

[1] "Pt-Sn bimetallic catalysts show the above mentioned characteristics to some extent more than the corresponding monometallic Pt catalysts"

[2] "Pt-Sn-SBA-15-IW exhibits higher selectivity to propylene and superior catalyst stability than that of Pt-SBA-15-IW due to weaker adsorption affinity of hydrocarbons on the surface Pt sites in Pt-Sn bimetallic particles."

[3] "Sn results in higher Pt dispersion by alloy formation in Pt-Sn-SBA-15-IW. This leads to the formation of smaller Pt particles in Pt-Sn-SBA-15-IW than in Pt-SBA-15-IW as evidenced by TEM, XRD and H2-chemisorption."

[4] "Sn might have preferentially located at highly coordinatively unsaturated surface Pt sites of bimetallic alloy Pt-Sn particles, as reported previously"

[5] "Sn acts as a scavenger to keep Pt sites clean from coke by draining-off the coke precursors from the vicinity of active sites to the support, which acts as a reservoir for coke deposits."

[6] "The nature and activity properties of surface Pt sites in the catalysts are different due to differences in surface roughness (i.e., surface site heterogeneity) of the particles. Additionally, catalytic properties of Pt sites are influenced by modification of electronic properties of the same sites by Sn in bimetallic PtSn alloy particles (Pt-Sn-SBA-15-IW)."

[1] "Pt-based catalysts are still regarded as the most effective catalysts for PDH process, especially when working with a promoter, such as In, Sn, Ga or Zn, which can further improve propylene selectivity"

[2] "The support materials, Al2O3, SiO2, ZrO2 and zeolite, can also affect catalytic performance on account of the significant differences in textural properties."

[3] "Especially, the Mg(Al)O oxides obtained by calcining hydrotalcite compounds (HT) have been studied extensively during the past years, owing to their suitable acidbase properties, high thermal stability, large surface area and memory effect"

[4] "Many works have been tried to stabilize the HT-based catalysts by combining with graphene networks, growing on metal (Al, Ni) or alloy substrates and loading on oxide materials (γ-Al2O3, ZnO, SnO2)"

[5] "The In0 has been proved to promote the transfer of coke from the active site to the support and the stabilization of the active metal species"

[6] "The formation of meixnerite can adjust the acidbase properties of the catalyst and improve its coke resistance"

[7] "The propane conversion and propylene selectivity of the catalyst reduced with H2/N2 can reach 51% and 97%, respectively, and even stabilize at 45% and 92% after running for 30 h. This is mainly attributable to its high Pt dispersion and In0/In3+ molar ratio, strong PtIn interaction and small metal particle size, which also result in a low content of coke deposits on the surface of the H2/N2-reduced catalyst."

[8] "The smaller metal particles are more active for propane dehydrogenation performance and beneficial to resist the coke deposition"

[9] "As a kind of HT with an interlayer -OH anion, the high crystallinity meixnerite may be helpful to keep the high dispersion and uniform distribution of surface metal active sites during reaction."

[1] "Ceria has wide applications in numerous catalytic processes, including CO oxidation, NOx reduction, and steam reforming. Owing to its high oxygen storage capacity (OSC), CeO2 tends to suppress coke formation using mobile oxygen released from the lattice to oxidize carbon deposits."

[2] "Doping metal cations into ceria is considered to be an effective way to regulate the structural and chemical properties of pure ceria."

[3] "The Ga addition markedly reduces the deactivation rate of catalyst and hence enhances the catalytic stability. The prominent impact of Ga addition is primarily attributed to the formation of PtGa alloys."

[4] "The influence of forming PtGa alloy on the catalytic performance could be attributed to a combination of geometric and electronic effects of metal promoter."

[5] "The enhanced reducibility of CeO2 is indicative of higher capability to eliminate the coke deposition and thus is beneficial to the improvement of catalytic stability."

[6] "We have presented an investigation into doping the Pt/CeO2-Al2O3 catalysts with Ga element to simultaneously enhance the redox property of CeO2 and modify the catalytic property of Pt nanoparticles."

[7] "The addition of Ga improves the catalytic performance of Pt catalysts in PDH, including increasing propylene selectivity and enhancing the catalytic stability."

[8] "The geometric effect of metal promoter contributes to decreasing the size of Pt ensembles or blocking the low-coordinated defect active sites and thereby suppressing the structure-sensitive side reactions, including hydrogenolysis and deep dehydrogenation."

[9] "The electronic effect of promoter is to lower the desorption barrier of alkenes and coke precursors by donating electron to Pt atoms, hindering alkenes adsorption on metal sites and consequently decreasing the likelihood of hydrogenolysis and coking."

[1] "Here we present a new family of very stable, active, and selective catalyst materials for the dehydrogenation of propane to propene based on PtGa/Al2O3."

[2] "A clear synergistic effect is observed between both components, which results in a very stable catalyst material that is highly resistant to deactivation, e.g., by coking."

[3] "Alkali metal dopants, such as K, are known to increase the propene selectivity and decrease coke deposition by poisoning the Brnsted acid sites present in the PDH catalysts."

[4] "When K is present on the catalyst, these sites are poisoned, inhibiting the formation of coke."

[5] "We postulate that the Pt assists in the recombination of the hydrogen atoms on the catalyst, making the active sites available for the following dehydrogenation cycle."

[6] "The catalysts show somewhat higher values for conversion at the start of a dehydrogenation cycle, which then slowly drop during the 15min cycle."

[7] "After the first PDH cycle, the conversion and selectivity of the catalysts does not drop, verifying that the catalysts are not deactivated."

[8] "For the eighth cycle, the values of propane conversion and propene selectivity have dropped for all catalysts. The deactivation is the least severe for those catalysts containing both Pt and Ga."

[9] "Long-term stability experiment with the Pt3GaK catalyst, which was cycled for ca. 150 times over a 14day period. During the first two days both the conversion and selectivity drop, after which the catalyst performance remains stable for 12days on stream."

[10] "As Table1 shows, the presence of K results in less darkening of the catalyst material, due to less coke being deposited."

[11] "The catalyst is highly resistant to coking and remains active for prolonged reaction times."

[1] "Extensive research efforts have been made to inhibit deactivation and improve propene selectivity of Pt-based catalysts by doping promoters of Sn, In, Ga and Cu to form bimetallic catalysts."

[2] "Besides promoters, another method is to modify Al2O3 support with ZnO, La2O3 or TiO2 or replace Al2O3 support with ZnAl2O4, ZSM-5 or Mg(Al)O oxide."

[3] "Additionally, it has been verified that the single Pt atom sites on Pt-Sn/γ-Al2O3 with a sandwich structure are more favorable for PDH reaction than Pt ensembles."

[4] "Given that the small Pt NPs and hierarchical microstructure may provide more stable and easily accessible active sites for PDH reaction, a promising design for obtaining the desired size of active Pt and hierarchical pore morphology was proposed."

[5] "The ball-flower-like PtIn/Mg(Al)O catalyst exhibited high activity, excellent propene selectivity and superior durability as well as excellent resistance to the carbon deposition and Pt-sintering in the propane dehydrogenation to propene, which were mainly arising from its multi-level hierarchical microstructure with low specific surface area, and a large amount of strong and stable PtIn interactions."

[1] "We developed a PDH catalyst that operates at thermodynamically limited conversion levels without the addition of hydrogen to the feed and exhibits excellent stability and selectivity to propylene (>99%). The catalyst is composed of silica-supported Pt1Sn1 NPs, synthesized and pretreated to ensure that the mixing of Pt and Sn is preserved during catalytic operation."

          [2] "The principle behind catalyst synthesis is to begin with a heterometallic Pt-Sn coordination complex in which Pt and Sn are in immediate contact, and this interaction is retained during the reduction and PDH reaction."

          [3] "This catalyst has three main features: (i) The PtSn NPs form an atomically mixed Pt-Sn precursor. (ii) Upon reduction, very small (less than 2 nm diameter) intermetallic PtSn NPs form. (iii) A benign interaction of these NPs with the SiO2 support avoids segregation of Pt and Sn and formation of a SnOx phase."

          [4] "We hypothesized that the performance and stability of the Pt1Sn1/SiO2 catalyst was derived from favorable interactions among the support (SiO2), promoter (Sn), and active metal (Pt), which allowed for a high degree of atomic mixing of Pt and Sn within very small intermetallic PtSn NPs."

          [5] "Even under these harsh, high-conversion and undiluted propane stream conditions, the Pt1Sn1/SiO2 catalyst was stable and operated at the thermodynamic conversion limit and >99% selectivity for at least 30 hours on stream, whereas the PtSn/γ-Al2O3 (commercial mimic) deactivated rapidly under these conditions"

          [6] "To alleviate this issue, large quantities of Sn are used in the catalyst preparation (the nominal atomic loading is Sn:Pt between 4 and 5), which increases the yield of intermetallic PtSn NPs (12). In addition, studies have shown that adding hydrogen to the reactant feed reduces the rate of catalyst deactivation (13)."

[1] "The addition of a second metal, such as tin, indium, or gallium, to platinum has been found to be effective in increasing ethene selectivity and suppressing coke formation"

[2] "Both geometric and electronic effects of the second metals have been proposed to explain their roles in modifying the catalyst surface and changing the surface chemistry involved in ethane dehydrogenation"

[3] "Deactivation decreased significantly with decreasing particle size and increasing Sn addition."

[4] "Operating at low residence time resulted in significantly lowered deactivation, attributable to lower coke formation from ethene, and allowed for measurement closer to the true initial activity."

[5] "For a fixed average particle size, the TOF and selectivity of these catalysts for ethene production increased with the content of Sn. These trends are attributed to a combination of geometric and electronic effects brought about by the presence of Sn on the surface of Pt nanoparticles"

[6] "Carbon deposition decreases with decreasing metal particle size and increasing Sn/Pt ratio."

[7] "To produce PtSn bimetallic particles, tin acetylacetonate (Sn(acac)2, 99.9%, Aldrich) was added together with Pt(acac)2 at the start of the procedure."

[8] "TOF was also found to increase with increasing particle size, a trend attributed to differences in the fraction of lower-coordinated surface atoms and in the electronic properties of the particles."

[9] "While ethane dehydrogenation may favor flatter surfaces, the gain in TOF is not significant enough to lose surface area by going to larger particles. Additionally, practical implementation of this system at high conversions suggests that small and Sn-promoted catalysts should be used to avoid coke formation."

[1] "To address this coke-induced deactivation, a regeneration step under an oxidative atmosphere has been incorporated to industrial dehydrogenation processes. This process is relatively straightforward, as coke is easily combusted in air at dehydrogenation reaction temperatures."

[2] "Several strategies have been applied to control coke formation. For example, coke deposition can be dramatically reduced by using a support with little to no Brnsted acidity, or by poisoning the acid sites. Changes in the reaction conditions, such as cofeeding steam, hydrogen, or CO2, can reduce coke formation, whereas high partial pressures of olefins and paraffins exacerbate coke deposition."

[3] "Alternatively, coke deposition can be reduced by adding a promoter element, the addition of Sn to Pt-based dehydrogenation catalysts being the best-known example."

[4] "The addition of Sn to the Pt-based catalyst facilitates this migration by weakening the binding of the hydrocarbon to the metal."

[5] "Tin is by far the most studied promoter, and all of the platinum-based catalyst formulations that are industrially applied include this post-transition metal, the addition of which modifies both the platinum active phase and the support. Essentially, Sn suppresses hydrogenolysis and isomerization reactions, minimizes metal sintering, neutralizes the acidity of the support, and facilitates the diffusion of the coke species from the metal surface to the support."

[6] "The addition of alkaline metals, such as Li, Na, and K, poisons these acid sites, suppressing the formation of coke on the support as shown in Figure 10."

[7] "Operando spectroscopy will provide the means for more sophisticated process control. Indeed, Raman/UVvis spectroscopy can be used to monitor noninvasively the amount and type of coke as the latter forms and accumulates on the catalyst surface."

[8] "An alternative solution lies in the use of solid oxygen carriers, such as CeO2, SbO4, In2O3, WO3, PbOx, Tl2O3, and BiO3, capable of selectively oxidizing the hydrogen evolved by the SHC reaction."

[9] "Another method of removing the hydrogen from the reaction mixture is the introduction of membranes to the reactor system. This approach allows hydrogen to diffuse out of the reactor, shifting the equilibrium toward the desired olefin product."

[1] "CoOx within dealuminated Beta (SiBeta) zeolite developing into ultrasmall-sized Co particles under H2 or reactant gas is highly efficient for catalyzing direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) to propylene reaction."

[2] "The dealumination of Beta zeolite developed by Dzwigaj et al. is a good way to further modify its structural and acidic properties, since the created T-vacant sites and low acidity are beneficial for many catalytic reactions"

[3] "After prereduction under optimum conditions, the 0.5CoSiBeta catalyst (Co loading is 0.5 wt%) showed propane conversion as high as 72% with propylene selectivity of around 92%."

[4] "The CoSiBeta catalysts with or without prereduction treatments show similar catalytic performance but different induction periods, implying that the metallic Co formed in situ during the reaction are the active sites."

[5] "After completion of the previous run, the catalysts were calcinated for 2 h in air at 600 C to remove the deposited coke for the next cycle without another reduction treatment. The catalytic activities of the regenerated 0.5CoSiBeta are almost the same as that obtained with the fresh catalyst over four cycles, indicating that deactivation is caused mainly by carbon deposits instead of sintering of cobalt."

[6] "Sulfate addition could lead to improved catalytic performance by dispersing cobalt species well and restraining the reduction to metallic Co"

[7] "Noticeably, the very weak acidity may be responsible for its superior propylene selectivity by boosting the propylene desorption."

[1] "Sn is often added to alter the product distribution for hydrocarbon conversion through the inhibition of hydrogenolysis, isomerisation, cracking and coke formation, thereby enhancing the catalyst selectivity and stability"

[2] "The presence of Sn as a promoter drastically improves the catalytic behavior. The PtSn/Al2O3 catalyst material possesses both a higher propane conversion and propene selectivity, which is maintained throughout the duration of the first dehydrogenation step."

[3] "The presence of Sn not only modifies the electronic properties of the Pt nanoparticles and therefore the activation of propane but also produces a drain-off effect. This drain-off effect keeps the Pt sites clean by removing the coke precursors from the vicinity of active sites to the support."

[4] "Kumar et al. proposed a modified drain-off effect, which is based on a combination of the electronic and drain-off effects."

[5] "It suggests that coke precursors such as olefinic species adsorb less strongly on the PtSn bimetallic catalyst due to an ensemble effect of Sn. Therefore, coke precursors are mobile and easily migrate to the support where they finally deposit as coke."

[1] "Extensive investigations have been performed to improve the catalytic performance and stability of Pt-based catalysts for PDH. The addition of promoters such as Sn, La, Ga and Zn species has been reported to be effective."

[2] "The addition of promoters is reported to facilitate propylene desorption in the bimetallic PtZn/Al2O3 catalyst and the metalmetal interaction is recognized as the origin of the enhanced performance in propane dehydrogenation."

[3] "PtCu/Al2O3 was examined by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and infrared spectroscopy of CO and propylene adsorption (CO-IR and C3H6-IR) to understand the interaction between Cu addition and the active sites of Pt."

[4] "The Cu addition results in an enhancement in propylene selectivity and catalyst stability, where PtCu0.5/Al2O3 exhibits the highest propylene selectivity with the lowest deactivation rate."

[5] "The Cu promoter plays a significant role in the reaction of PDH by inducing the metal interaction between Pt and Cu, which is the primary origin of the enhanced propylene selectivity and anti-coking ability of the PtCu/Al2O3 catalyst."

[6] "The facile desorption of propylene from the PtCu/Al2O3 catalyst guarantees the high propylene selectivity by diminishing the possibility of polymerization reactions for coke formation and other undesired side reactions such as thermal cracking reactions forming lighter hydrocarbons."

[7] "Zhang et al. studied a PtSn/ZSM-5 catalyst and inferred that Sn could change the interfacial characteristics between the Pt metal and the ZSM-5 support, which facilitated the desorption of carbon deposits from metal clusters to the carrier, resulting in improved stability."

[8] "An enhanced catalytic performance of a zinc-doped platinum catalyst was reported by Yu et al. The weakened adsorption of propylene on the metal surface of PtZn/Al2O3, caused by the change of electronic environment of Pt, was proposed as the reason for the good anti-coking ability and high propylene selectivity."
