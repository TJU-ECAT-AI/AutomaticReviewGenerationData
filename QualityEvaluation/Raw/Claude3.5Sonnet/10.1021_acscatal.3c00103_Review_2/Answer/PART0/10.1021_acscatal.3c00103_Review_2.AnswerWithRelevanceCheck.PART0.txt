          Recent key strategies and approaches developed to enhance the catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts in direct dehydrogenation processes include:

1. Introduction of promoters: This involves adding metal promoters to form alloys or intermetallic compounds in Pt-based catalysts, and introducing other metal oxides to form oxide compounds in metal oxide-based catalysts. These strategies help regulate active compounds, improve dispersion of active species, and enhance catalytic stability.

2. Noble metal regulation: For metal oxide-based catalysts, the addition of noble metals (e.g., Pt) can improve dehydrogenation performance by modifying the properties of the metal oxide active sites.

3. Subsurface regulation: This method involves tuning the adsorptive properties of metal alloys by manipulating their subsurface composition, which enhances catalytic performance.

4. Multipromoter systems: Some researchers have developed catalysts with multiple promoters to achieve synergistic effects and further improve stability.

5. Structural modifications: Strategies such as creating surface defects on supports or designing specific nanostructures have been employed to stabilize active species and improve catalyst durability.

These advancements address challenges in catalyst design, fabrication, and performance optimization by:

1. Enhancing dispersion and stability of active sites
2. Modifying electronic and geometric properties of catalysts
3. Improving resistance to coking and sintering
4. Increasing selectivity towards desired products
5. Prolonging catalyst lifetime and reducing deactivation rates

These strategies aim to develop more efficient, stable, and selective catalysts for industrial applications in direct dehydrogenation processes, potentially leading to improved process economics and sustainability.
