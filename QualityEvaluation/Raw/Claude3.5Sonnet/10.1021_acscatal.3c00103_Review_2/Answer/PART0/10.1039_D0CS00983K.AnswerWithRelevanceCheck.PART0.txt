          [1] "To recover the activity completely, the sintered Pt particles must be redispersed. Generally, simple coke burning-off by air cannot realize redispersion, but aggravates the sintering of Pt particles. For the commercial dehydrogenation units using supported Pt catalyst, the spent catalyst is regenerated by air in the presence of a halide (generally, chlorine), the role of which is to redisperse sintered Pt particles."

[2] "The addition of a second metal has been found to be highly effective for the sintering resistance of Pt particles. The introduced metal forms alloys with Pt around Pt particles, and the alloys anchor them on the surface of the carriers, making them not easy to migrate and coalesce."

[3] "The application of the carriers possessing a strong interaction with Pt is another way to retard the sintering. Al2O3 is the most common carrier of Pt catalyst, in which the coordinatively unsaturated pentacoordinate Al3+ can anchor Pt to make it not easy to migrate."

[4] "The Al2O3 overcoat has also proved to be efficient in preventing the sintering of Pt nanoparticles through atomic layer deposition."

[5] "Recently, Pt supported on CeO2 has attracted more attention because of the ability of CeO2 to trap Pt in an atomically dispersed state. The atomically dispersed Pt is most likely to be present in the form of Pt2+ bonded to the ubiquitous step edges of the CeO2 surface."

[6] "To improve the coking resistance of the catalyst is the most effective way to prolong the time between regenerations."

[7] "Introducing a small amount of H2O into the reactor can also reduce coke significantly, but it decreases the conversion due to the competitive adsorption with the feed."

[8] "The monometallic Pt/CeO2 catalyst is very stable even at 800 C, but only catalyzes the CC bond cleavage of hydrocarbons. The addition of Sn to form small PtSn clusters results in a highly selective catalyst in propane dehydrogenation. What is noticeable is that the deactivated PtSn/CeO2 catalyst can be regenerated fully by burning coke without oxychlorination to redisperse Pt."

[9] "To improve the coking resistance of the catalyst, Ba has been introduced. The coverage of surface tetrahedrally coordinated Ga by Ba leads to the decreased coke formation and increased ethylene selectivity."

          Recent strategies and approaches to enhance the catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts in direct dehydrogenation processes include:

1. Redispersion of sintered Pt particles: For commercial dehydrogenation units, spent catalysts are regenerated using air in the presence of halides (typically chlorine) to redisperse sintered Pt particles, as simple coke burning is ineffective and can worsen sintering.

2. Addition of a second metal: Forming alloys with Pt helps anchor particles to the carrier surface, preventing migration and coalescence, thus improving sintering resistance.

3. Use of carriers with strong metal-support interactions: Carriers like Al2O3, with coordinatively unsaturated Al3+ sites, can anchor Pt particles and reduce migration.

4. Application of overcoats: Al2O3 overcoats applied through atomic layer deposition have proven effective in preventing Pt nanoparticle sintering.

5. Novel support materials: CeO2 supports have gained attention for their ability to trap Pt in an atomically dispersed state, likely as Pt2+ bonded to step edges on the CeO2 surface.

6. Improving coking resistance: This is considered the most effective way to prolong time between regenerations. Strategies include:
   a. Introducing small amounts of H2O into the reactor, although this may decrease conversion due to competitive adsorption.
   b. Adding promoters like Ba to cover active sites, reducing coke formation while maintaining selectivity.

7. Development of stable and selective catalysts: PtSn/CeO2 catalysts have shown high stability and selectivity in propane dehydrogenation, with the added benefit of full regeneration through simple coke burning without the need for oxychlorination.

These advancements address challenges in catalyst design, fabrication, and performance optimization for industrial applications by:
- Improving sintering and coking resistance
- Enhancing metal dispersion and stability
- Simplifying regeneration processes
- Maintaining high activity and selectivity over longer periods
- Reducing the frequency of regeneration cycles

The strategies aim to prolong catalyst lifetime, improve process efficiency, and enhance overall economic viability of direct dehydrogenation processes in industrial settings.

          最近在直接脱氢过程中提高负载金属催化剂催化稳定性的策略和方法包括：

1. 烧结Pt颗粒的重新分散：对于商业脱氢装置，在含卤素（通常是氯）的空气中再生失效催化剂，以重新分散烧结的Pt颗粒，因为简单的积碳燃烧无效且可能加剧烧结。

2. 添加第二种金属：与Pt形成合金有助于将颗粒锚定在载体表面，防止迁移和聚集，从而提高抗烧结能力。

3. 使用具有强金属-载体相互作用的载体：如Al2O3这样的载体，具有配位不饱和的Al3+位点，可以锚定Pt颗粒并减少迁移。

4. 应用覆盖层：通过原子层沉积技术应用的Al2O3覆盖层已被证明能有效防止Pt纳米颗粒烧结。

5. 新型载体材料：CeO2载体因其能够以原子分散状态捕获Pt而受到关注，可能以Pt2+的形式结合在CeO2表面的台阶边缘。

6. 提高抗积碳能力：这被认为是延长再生周期的最有效方法。策略包括：
   a. 向反应器中引入少量H2O，尽管这可能由于竞争吸附而降低转化率。
   b. 添加如Ba等助剂覆盖活性位点，减少积碳形成，同时保持选择性。

7. 开发稳定和高选择性催化剂：PtSn/CeO2催化剂在丙烷脱氢中表现出高稳定性和选择性，并且具有通过简单的积碳燃烧即可完全再生的额外优势，无需氧氯化。

这些进展通过以下方式解决了催化剂设计、制备和性能优化在工业应用中的挑战：
- 提高抗烧结和抗积碳能力
- 增强金属分散度和稳定性
- 简化再生过程
- 在更长时间内保持高活性和选择性
- 减少再生周期的频率

这些策略旨在延长催化剂寿命，提高工艺效率，并增强直接脱氢过程在工业环境中的整体经济可行性。
