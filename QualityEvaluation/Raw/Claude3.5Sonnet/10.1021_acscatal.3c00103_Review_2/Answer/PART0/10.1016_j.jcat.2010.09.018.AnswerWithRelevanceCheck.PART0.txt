          [1] "Sn is often added to alter the product distribution for hydrocarbon conversion through the inhibition of hydrogenolysis, isomerisation, cracking and coke formation, thereby enhancing the catalyst selectivity and stability"

[2] "The presence of Sn as a promoter drastically improves the catalytic behavior. The PtSn/Al2O3 catalyst material possesses both a higher propane conversion and propene selectivity, which is maintained throughout the duration of the first dehydrogenation step."

[3] "The presence of Sn not only modifies the electronic properties of the Pt nanoparticles and therefore the activation of propane but also produces a drain-off effect. This drain-off effect keeps the Pt sites clean by removing the coke precursors from the vicinity of active sites to the support."

[4] "Kumar et al. proposed a modified drain-off effect, which is based on a combination of the electronic and drain-off effects."

[5] "It suggests that coke precursors such as olefinic species adsorb less strongly on the PtSn bimetallic catalyst due to an ensemble effect of Sn. Therefore, coke precursors are mobile and easily migrate to the support where they finally deposit as coke."

          Recent strategies and approaches to enhance the catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts in direct dehydrogenation processes include:

1. Addition of promoters: Sn is commonly added to Pt catalysts to inhibit side reactions and coke formation, thereby improving selectivity and stability.

2. Bimetallic catalyst development: PtSn bimetallic catalysts show higher conversion, selectivity, and stability compared to monometallic Pt catalysts.

3. Electronic property modification: Sn modifies the electronic properties of Pt nanoparticles, affecting propane activation and catalyst performance.

4. Drain-off effect utilization: This effect keeps active sites clean by facilitating the migration of coke precursors from active sites to the support.

5. Modified drain-off effect: Combines electronic effects with the drain-off effect to further enhance catalyst performance.

6. Ensemble effect exploitation: In PtSn catalysts, the presence of Sn weakens the adsorption of coke precursors, making them more mobile and easier to migrate to the support.

These advancements address challenges in catalyst design, fabrication, and performance optimization by:
- Improving selectivity towards desired products
- Enhancing catalyst stability and longevity
- Reducing deactivation due to coking
- Optimizing the electronic and structural properties of active sites
- Maintaining catalyst activity over multiple reaction-regeneration cycles

The strategies aim to create more robust and efficient catalysts suitable for prolonged use in industrial dehydrogenation applications.

          最近为提高直接脱氢过程中负载金属催化剂的催化稳定性而开发的策略和方法包括：

1. 添加助剂：通常向Pt催化剂中添加Sn以抑制副反应和积碳形成，从而提高选择性和稳定性。

2. 双金属催化剂开发：与单金属Pt催化剂相比，PtSn双金属催化剂表现出更高的转化率、选择性和稳定性。

3. 电子性质修饰：Sn改变Pt纳米粒子的电子性质，影响丙烷活化和催化剂性能。

4. 利用排出效应：该效应通过促进积碳前体从活性位点向载体迁移，保持活性位点清洁。

5. 改进的排出效应：结合电子效应和排出效应，进一步提高催化剂性能。

6. 利用集合效应：在PtSn催化剂中，Sn的存在削弱了积碳前体的吸附，使其更容易移动并迁移到载体上。
