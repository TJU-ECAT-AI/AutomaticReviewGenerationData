          [1] "Many efforts have been made to improve the resistance to coke and to protect the active sites from aggregating, both of which are considered as the main reasons for catalyst deactivation."

[2] "Introduction of transition metal (Zn), alkaline metal (Na, K), alkaline earth metal (Mg, Ca), and rare earth metal (La, Ce), etc. into the catalysts as promotors offered another strategy to enhance the interaction between Pt and Sn and tune the acidbase property simultaneously."

[3] "The redox property, ability of antisintering, and the resistance to coke deposition exhibited integrated effects in achieving better catalytic stability."

[4] "The In additive was helpful to form larger amounts of surface Pt oxides, and it could also promote the reduction of them and stabilize the metallic Pt under the reaction conditions, although the Pt oxides were only partially reduced according to the combined findings from TPR, XPS, and XRD."

[5] "The results showed that such a preparation procedure could efficiently enhance the interaction between the support and Pt, and compared with the sample where Pt and Sn were coimpregnated, the catalytic activity of propane dehydrogenation was therefore improved."

[6] "Ce and In exhibited a super strong ability in stopping the Pt crystallite from growing under the reaction conditions, which evidently occurred over the La- and Fe-promoted catalysts from XRD results."

[7] "The In promotor helped the reaction stabilize in shorter time (3 h) and performed better in the long term catalytic stability test as the conversion lost only 12.8% and the selectivity of propylene was kept nearly constant in maximum of about 99.0% during 33 h time on stream."

          Recent key strategies and approaches to enhance the catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts in direct dehydrogenation processes include:

1. Improving resistance to coke formation and preventing active site aggregation, which are major causes of deactivation.

2. Introducing promoter metals such as transition metals (Zn), alkaline metals (Na, K), alkaline earth metals (Mg, Ca), and rare earth metals (La, Ce) to enhance interaction between active metals (e.g., Pt and Sn) and tune acid-base properties.

3. Optimizing catalyst preparation methods to strengthen metal-support interactions, leading to improved catalytic activity.

4. Focusing on the integrated effects of redox properties, anti-sintering ability, and coke resistance to achieve better stability.

5. Using specific promoters like indium (In) to:
   a. Form larger amounts of surface Pt oxides
   b. Promote reduction of Pt oxides
   c. Stabilize metallic Pt under reaction conditions
   d. Help reactions stabilize faster (e.g., in 3 hours)
   e. Improve long-term catalytic stability (e.g., only 12.8% conversion loss and nearly constant propylene selectivity of about 99.0% over 33 hours)

6. Employing promoters like Ce and In to prevent Pt crystallite growth under reaction conditions.

These advancements address challenges in catalyst design, fabrication, and performance optimization for industrial applications by targeting key deactivation mechanisms, enhancing metal-support interactions, and fine-tuning catalyst properties for improved activity, selectivity, and long-term stability.

          最近为提高直接脱氢过程中负载金属催化剂的催化稳定性而开发的关键策略和方法包括：

1. 提高抗积碳能力并防止活性位点聚集，这是导致失活的主要原因。

2. 引入促进剂金属，如过渡金属（Zn）、碱金属（Na，K）、碱土金属（Mg，Ca）和稀土金属（La，Ce）等，以增强活性金属（如Pt和Sn）之间的相互作用并调节酸碱性质。

3. 优化催化剂制备方法以加强金属-载体相互作用，从而提高催化活性。

4. 关注氧化还原性能、抗烧结能力和抗积碳性能的综合效应，以实现更好的稳定性。

5. 使用特定的促进剂，如铟（In），以：
   a. 形成更多的表面Pt氧化物
   b. 促进Pt氧化物的还原
   c. 在反应条件下稳定金属Pt
   d. 帮助反应更快稳定（例如，在3小时内）
   e. 改善长期催化稳定性（例如，33小时内转化率仅损失12.8%，丙烯选择性保持在约99.0%的近乎恒定水平）

6. 使用Ce和In等促进剂来防止Pt晶粒在反应条件下生长。

这些进展通过针对关键失活机制、增强金属-载体相互作用以及精细调节催化剂性能来解决工业应用中催化剂设计、制造和性能优化的挑战，从而提高活性、选择性和长期稳定性。
