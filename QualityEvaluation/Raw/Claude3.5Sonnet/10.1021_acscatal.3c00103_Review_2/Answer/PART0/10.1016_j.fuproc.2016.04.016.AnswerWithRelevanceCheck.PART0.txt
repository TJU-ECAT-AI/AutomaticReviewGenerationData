          [1] "Pt is the most versatile noble metal catalyst for alkane reactions. Although Pt is expensive, the choice of Pt is often justified by its higher activity, stability and selectivity for these reactions compared to less expensive alternative transition metals."

[2] "Waku et al. exploited the unique property of zeolite as a support for achieving high metal dispersion through cation exchange sites to create a Pt/Na[Fe]-ZSM-5 catalyst with outstanding stability for dehydrogenation of light alkanes."

[3] "They found that the catalyst deactivation rate of Pt/Na[Fe]-ZSM-5 was lower than for any other Pt-based catalysts in refractory oxide support. The unprecedented performance of Pt/Na[Fe]-ZSM-5 was attributed to its high Pt dispersion (cluster size < 1 mm) on zeolite through ion-exchange."

[4] "There is a tendency to generate some Brnsted protons on the zeolite during the exchange process, but the choice of Fe3+ as an isomorphous cation in place of Al3+ led to weaker Brnsted sites in [Fe]-ZSM compared to [Al]-ZSM. The weaker acidity minimizes the tendency of side reactions (cracking of oligomerization, aromatisation, and coke), which translates into higher alkene selectivity and catalyst stability."

[5] "Promotion of Pt with metals, such as Sn, Ga, Zn, Re, etc., improves catalyst stability, but also leads to faster deactivation rates than Pt/Na[Fe]-ZSM-5."

[6] "Recent reports by Bell et al. show that the use of calcined hydrotalcite (Al/Mg  0.1) supported on bimetallic PtGa or PtSn gave very high alkene selectivity and stability, comparable to Pt/Na[Fe]-ZSM-5."

[7] "Elimination of the proton sites of zeolites is critical for obtaining a high alkene selectivity and stability in dehydrogenation catalysts."

          Recent key strategies and approaches to enhance catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts in direct dehydrogenation processes include:

1. Using platinum as the primary active metal due to its superior activity, stability, and selectivity compared to cheaper alternatives.

2. Employing zeolites as supports to achieve high metal dispersion through cation exchange sites. For example, Pt/Na[Fe]-ZSM-5 showed outstanding stability due to high Pt dispersion (cluster size < 1 mm).

3. Careful selection of zeolite framework composition, such as using Fe3+ instead of Al3+ to create weaker Brønsted acid sites. This minimizes side reactions and improves alkene selectivity and catalyst stability.

4. Promoting Pt with metals like Sn, Ga, Zn, and Re to improve stability, although this can lead to faster deactivation compared to Pt/Na[Fe]-ZSM-5.

5. Using calcined hydrotalcite (Al/Mg ≈ 0.1) as a support for bimetallic PtGa or PtSn catalysts, which showed high alkene selectivity and stability comparable to Pt/Na[Fe]-ZSM-5.

6. Eliminating proton sites on zeolite supports to improve alkene selectivity and catalyst stability.

These advancements address challenges in catalyst design, fabrication, and performance optimization for industrial applications by:

- Improving metal dispersion to increase active site accessibility and stability
- Controlling support acidity to minimize side reactions and coking
- Tailoring electronic properties of active sites through bimetallic formulations
- Optimizing metal-support interactions for enhanced stability
- Exploring novel support materials and compositions to balance activity, selectivity, and longevity

These strategies aim to develop more efficient and stable catalysts that can withstand the harsh conditions of industrial dehydrogenation processes while maintaining high activity and selectivity over extended periods.

          最近为提高直接脱氢过程中负载金属催化剂的催化稳定性而开发的关键策略和方法包括：

1. 使用铂作为主要活性金属，因为与较便宜的替代品相比，它具有更高的活性、稳定性和选择性。

2. 利用沸石作为载体，通过阳离子交换位点实现高金属分散度。例如，Pt/Na[Fe]-ZSM-5由于高铂分散度（簇大小<1毫米）而表现出优异的稳定性。

3. 仔细选择沸石骨架组成，例如使用Fe3+代替Al3+来创造较弱的Brønsted酸位点。这最大限度地减少了副反应，提高了烯烃选择性和催化剂稳定性。

4. 用Sn、Ga、Zn和Re等金属促进Pt以提高稳定性，尽管这可能导致比Pt/Na[Fe]-ZSM-5更快的失活。

5. 使用煅烧的水滑石（Al/Mg ≈ 0.1）作为双金属PtGa或PtSn催化剂的载体，显示出与Pt/Na[Fe]-ZSM-5相当的高烯烃选择性和稳定性。

6. 消除沸石载体上的质子位点，以提高烯烃选择性和催化剂稳定性。

这些进展通过以下方式解决了工业应用中催化剂设计、制造和性能优化的挑战：

- 提高金属分散度以增加活性位点的可及性和稳定性
- 控制载体酸度以最大限度地减少副反应和积碳
- 通过双金属配方调节活性位点的电子性质
- 优化金属-载体相互作用以增强稳定性
- 探索新型载体材料和组成以平衡活性、选择性和寿命

这些策略旨在开发更高效、更稳定的催化剂，能够在保持高活性和选择性的同时withstand工业脱氢过程的苛刻条件长时间运行。
