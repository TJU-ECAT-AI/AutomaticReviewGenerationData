          [1] "Here we present a new family of very stable, active, and selective catalyst materials for the dehydrogenation of propane to propene based on PtGa/Al2O3."

[2] "A clear synergistic effect is observed between both components, which results in a very stable catalyst material that is highly resistant to deactivation, e.g., by coking."

[3] "Alkali metal dopants, such as K, are known to increase the propene selectivity and decrease coke deposition by poisoning the Brnsted acid sites present in the PDH catalysts."

[4] "When K is present on the catalyst, these sites are poisoned, inhibiting the formation of coke."

[5] "We postulate that the Pt assists in the recombination of the hydrogen atoms on the catalyst, making the active sites available for the following dehydrogenation cycle."

[6] "The catalysts show somewhat higher values for conversion at the start of a dehydrogenation cycle, which then slowly drop during the 15min cycle."

[7] "After the first PDH cycle, the conversion and selectivity of the catalysts does not drop, verifying that the catalysts are not deactivated."

[8] "For the eighth cycle, the values of propane conversion and propene selectivity have dropped for all catalysts. The deactivation is the least severe for those catalysts containing both Pt and Ga."

[9] "Long-term stability experiment with the Pt3GaK catalyst, which was cycled for ca. 150 times over a 14day period. During the first two days both the conversion and selectivity drop, after which the catalyst performance remains stable for 12days on stream."

[10] "As Table1 shows, the presence of K results in less darkening of the catalyst material, due to less coke being deposited."

[11] "The catalyst is highly resistant to coking and remains active for prolonged reaction times."

          Recent strategies and approaches to enhance catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts in direct dehydrogenation processes include:

1. Developing synergistic multi-component catalysts: PtGa/Al2O3 catalysts show high stability and resistance to deactivation due to the synergy between Pt and Ga components.

2. Incorporating alkali metal dopants: Addition of potassium (K) increases propene selectivity and decreases coke deposition by poisoning Brønsted acid sites.

3. Optimizing metal combinations: Catalysts containing both Pt and Ga show the least severe deactivation over multiple cycles, indicating improved stability.

4. Promoting hydrogen recombination: Pt is postulated to assist in recombining hydrogen atoms, keeping active sites available for subsequent dehydrogenation cycles.

5. Creating mixed metal oxides: Formation of a mixed Al-Ga oxide structure contributes to catalyst stability by making Ga less reducible.

6. Controlling metal dispersion and interaction: The presence of Pt affects the distribution of Ga on the catalyst surface, leading to more active tetrahedral Ga3+ species.

7. Implementing cyclic regeneration processes: High-temperature (750°C) regeneration steps help maintain catalyst activity over multiple cycles.

These advancements address challenges in catalyst design, fabrication, and performance optimization for industrial applications by:

1. Improving long-term stability: The Pt-Ga-K catalyst maintains stable performance over extended periods (12 days) after an initial break-in period.

2. Reducing coking: The addition of K and the synergistic effect of Pt and Ga help minimize coke formation on the catalyst surface.

3. Enhancing selectivity: The combination of metals and promoters results in high selectivity towards the desired propene product.

4. Maintaining high activity: The catalyst design allows for high propane conversion rates close to equilibrium values.

5. Increasing resistance to deactivation: The synergistic effect between Pt and Ga results in less severe deactivation compared to catalysts containing only one of these metals.

6. Optimizing regeneration processes: The cyclic nature of the process with high-temperature regeneration steps helps maintain catalyst activity over multiple cycles.

These improvements contribute to better catalyst performance and longevity in industrial applications, potentially leading to more efficient and economical propane dehydrogenation processes.

3. 提高选择性：金属和助剂的组合导致对目标产物丙烯的高选择性。

4. 保持高活性：催化剂设计允许接近平衡值的高丙烷转化率。

5. 增强抗失活性：Pt和Ga之间的协同作用导致失活程度比仅含有这些金属之一的催化剂更轻微。

6. 优化再生过程：具有高温再生步骤的循环过程有助于在多个循环中维持催化剂活性。

这些改进有助于提高工业应用中催化剂的性能和寿命，可能导致更高效和经济的丙烷脱氢过程。
