          [1] "VOx/ZrO2, a well-known catalyst for ODH, has a much more superior PDH performance than commonly used VOx/Al2O3. The turnover frequency (TOF) is six times higher by loading VOx on ZrO2 than on Al2O3."

[2] "Combining H2-temperature programmed reduction, in situ Raman spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and theoretical studies, we find that the interaction between VOx and ZrO2 can facilitate the reduction of VO bonds, including VO, VOV and VOZr."

[3] "The promoting effect could be attributed to the formation of low coordinated V species in VOx/ZrO2 which is more active in CH activation."

[4] "We performed 120 min of the on stream reaction and studied the reaction–regeneration cycles over 1VZr (Fig. S2b and S3). The propane conversion and propylene selectivity exhibit little change during six cycles, implying outstanding regeneration stability."

[5] "Alternatively, supported vanadium oxide is a promising catalyst compared with Pt and CrOx for its competitive performance, low cost and low toxicity."

[6] "We propose the enhanced CH activation on VZr results from the facile reduction of VO, VOV and VOZr bonds, thus producing deeply reduced and lower coordinated V species."

[7] "It is generally accepted that the support could affect reactivity by stabilizing the active sites and/or altering the electron state of active sites."

[8] "Considering the dramatic performance achieved through the interaction between VOx and ZrO2, our work provides a new insight into high-performance VOx-based catalysts for propane dehydrogenation."

          Recent strategies and approaches to enhance the catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts in direct dehydrogenation processes include:

1. Support selection: Using ZrO2 as a support for VOx catalysts instead of commonly used Al2O3 significantly improves catalytic performance. The VOx/ZrO2 catalyst shows six times higher turnover frequency compared to VOx/Al2O3.

2. Optimizing metal-support interactions: The interaction between VOx and ZrO2 facilitates the reduction of VO, VOV, and VOZr bonds, leading to the formation of low-coordinated V species that are more active in C-H activation.

3. Facilitating reduction of metal-oxygen bonds: The weaker interaction between VOx and ZrO2 compared to VOx and Al2O3 allows for easier reduction of VO bonds, resulting in improved catalytic performance.

4. Enhancing regeneration stability: The VOx/ZrO2 catalyst demonstrates excellent regeneration stability, maintaining consistent propane conversion and propylene selectivity over multiple reaction-regeneration cycles.

5. Using alternative metals: Supported vanadium oxide is proposed as a promising alternative to Pt and CrOx catalysts, offering competitive performance with lower cost and toxicity.

These advancements address challenges in catalyst design, fabrication, and performance optimization for industrial applications by:

1. Improving activity and selectivity through careful selection of support materials.
2. Enhancing the formation of active sites through facilitated reduction of metal-oxygen bonds.
3. Optimizing metal-support interactions to achieve desired catalytic properties.
4. Ensuring long-term stability and regenerability of the catalyst for industrial applications.
5. Reducing costs and environmental impact while maintaining competitive performance.

The research provides new insights into developing high-performance VOx-based catalysts for industrial propane dehydrogenation applications, emphasizing the importance of understanding and optimizing metal-support interactions for improved catalyst design.

          最近提高直接脱氢过程中负载金属催化剂催化稳定性的策略和方法包括：

1. 载体选择：使用ZrO2作为VOx催化剂的载体，而不是常用的Al2O3，显著提高了催化性能。VOx/ZrO2催化剂的转化频率比VOx/Al2O3高6倍。

2. 优化金属-载体相互作用：VOx与ZrO2之间的相互作用促进了VO、VOV和VOZr键的还原，导致形成在C-H活化中更活跃的低配位V物种。

3. 促进金属-氧键的还原：与VOx和Al2O3相比，VOx和ZrO2之间较弱的相互作用允许VO键更容易还原，从而提高催化性能。

4. 提高再生稳定性：VOx/ZrO2催化剂表现出优异的再生稳定性，在多次反应-再生循环中保持稳定的丙烷转化率和丙烯选择性。

5. 使用替代金属：提出负载钒氧化物作为Pt和CrOx催化剂的有前景替代品，提供具有竞争力的性能，同时降低成本和毒性。

这些进展通过以下方式解决了催化剂设计、制造和性能优化在工业应用中的挑战：

1. 通过仔细选择载体材料来提高活性和选择性。
2. 通过促进金属-氧键的还原来增强活性位点的形成。
3. 优化金属-载体相互作用以获得所需的催化性能。
4. 确保催化剂在工业应用中的长期稳定性和可再生性。
5. 在保持竞争性能的同时降低成本和环境影响。

该研究为开发用于工业丙烷脱氢应用的高性能VOx基催化剂提供了新的见解，强调了理解和优化金属-载体相互作用对改进催化剂设计的重要性。
