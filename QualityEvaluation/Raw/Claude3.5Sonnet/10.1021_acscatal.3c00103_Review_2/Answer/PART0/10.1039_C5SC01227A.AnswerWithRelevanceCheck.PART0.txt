          [1] "Although supported Pt catalysts show high activity, the catalyst deactivation due to coke formation remains a challenging issue."

[2] "The robustness against coking can be increased with additional promoters, such as late transition metals, main-group metals including Sn and Ga, alkali-metal oxides and rare-earth metal oxides."

[3] "Previous experimental studies have shown that the selectivity towards propylene during propane dehydrogenation on Pt particles can be increased by alloying late transition metals or main-group metals such as Cu and Sn."

[4] "DFT calculations indicate that the binding energy of propylene is weakened by at least 8 kJ mol1 after alloying different amounts of Sn in Pt(111). Meanwhile, all the dehydrogenation barriers shift up, including deep dehydrogenation from propylene."

[5] "Calculations have shown that these elements tend to occupy the step sites and thus avoid the formation of graphene islands."

[6] "Different approaches have been proposed to encounter the coking problem. It could be shown that the adsorption of C atoms on the closed packed surface of a NiAu surface alloy is thermodynamically less favoured, by 23 kJ mol1 or more, than the analogous process on a pure Ni(111) surface."

[7] "A cheaper alternative is to alloy Ni with Sn which hinders the CC bond formation and enhances the CO bond formation leading to the removal of surface C centers as carbon monoxide."

[8] "Since the step sites play an essential role in the growth of the graphene islands, as mentioned above, additives such as potassium,66 sulfur,66 gold66 or boron131 have been proposed.66 Computational calculations have shown that these elements tend to occupy the step sites and thus avoid the formation of graphene islands."

          Recent strategies to enhance catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts in direct dehydrogenation processes include:

1. Alloying: Combining Pt or Ni with metals like Cu, Sn, or Au to improve selectivity, reduce coking, and modify surface properties. For example:
   - PtCu and PtSn alloys increase selectivity towards propylene and inhibit secondary reactions.
   - NiAu alloys make carbon adsorption less favorable.
   - NiSn alloys hinder CC bond formation and promote CO bond formation to remove surface carbon.

2. Adding promoters: Incorporating late transition metals, main-group metals (Sn, Ga), alkali-metal oxides, and rare-earth metal oxides to increase coking resistance.

3. Modifying surface properties: Alloying changes binding energies of intermediates and products, and affects reaction barriers. For instance, adding Sn to Pt weakens propylene binding and increases dehydrogenation barriers.

4. Blocking step sites: Adding elements like potassium, sulfur, gold, or boron to occupy step sites on catalyst surfaces, preventing graphene island formation that leads to coking.

5. Optimizing catalyst structure: Designing catalysts with specific surface structures or particle sizes to enhance stability and selectivity.

These approaches address challenges in catalyst design by:
- Reducing coking and deactivation
- Improving selectivity towards desired products
- Enhancing catalyst longevity
- Optimizing activity-selectivity trade-offs
- Providing fundamental insights to guide rational catalyst development

For industrial applications, these strategies aim to extend catalyst lifetime, improve selectivity, and optimize performance by balancing activity and stability. They demonstrate how combining theoretical studies with experimental work can lead to more efficient and durable catalysts for dehydrogenation processes.

          最近提高直接脱氢过程中负载金属催化剂稳定性的策略包括：

1. 合金化：将铂或镍与铜、锡或金等金属结合，以提高选择性、减少积碳和改变表面性质。例如：
   - 铂铜和铂锡合金提高了对丙烯的选择性并抑制了次级反应。
   - 镍金合金使碳吸附不利。
   - 镍锡合金抑制碳-碳键形成并促进碳-氧键形成，从而去除表面碳。

2. 添加助剂：引入后过渡金属、主族金属（锡、镓）、碱金属氧化物和稀土金属氧化物以增加抗积碳能力。

3. 修改表面性质：合金化改变了中间体和产物的结合能，并影响反应能垒。例如，向铂中添加锡会减弱丙烯的结合并增加脱氢反应能垒。

4. 阻塞台阶位点：添加钾、硫、金或硼等元素占据催化剂表面的台阶位点，防止导致积碳的石墨烯岛形成。

5. 优化催化剂结构：设计具有特定表面结构或粒径的催化剂，以提高稳定性和选择性。

这些方法通过以下方式解决了催化剂设计中的挑战：
- 减少积碳和失活
- 提高对目标产物的选择性
- 增强催化剂寿命
- 优化活性-选择性权衡
- 提供基础洞察以指导合理的催化剂开发

对于工业应用，这些策略旨在延长催化剂寿命、提高选择性，并通过平衡活性和稳定性来优化性能。它们展示了如何将理论研究与实验工作相结合，可以为脱氢过程开发更高效和更耐用的催化剂。
