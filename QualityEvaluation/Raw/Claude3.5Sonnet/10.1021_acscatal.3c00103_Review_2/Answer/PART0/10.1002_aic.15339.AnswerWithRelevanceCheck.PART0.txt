          [1] "Ceria has wide applications in numerous catalytic processes, including CO oxidation, NOx reduction, and steam reforming. Owing to its high oxygen storage capacity (OSC), CeO2 tends to suppress coke formation using mobile oxygen released from the lattice to oxidize carbon deposits."

[2] "Doping metal cations into ceria is considered to be an effective way to regulate the structural and chemical properties of pure ceria."

[3] "The Ga addition markedly reduces the deactivation rate of catalyst and hence enhances the catalytic stability. The prominent impact of Ga addition is primarily attributed to the formation of PtGa alloys."

[4] "The influence of forming PtGa alloy on the catalytic performance could be attributed to a combination of geometric and electronic effects of metal promoter."

[5] "The enhanced reducibility of CeO2 is indicative of higher capability to eliminate the coke deposition and thus is beneficial to the improvement of catalytic stability."

[6] "We have presented an investigation into doping the Pt/CeO2-Al2O3 catalysts with Ga element to simultaneously enhance the redox property of CeO2 and modify the catalytic property of Pt nanoparticles."

[7] "The addition of Ga improves the catalytic performance of Pt catalysts in PDH, including increasing propylene selectivity and enhancing the catalytic stability."

[8] "The geometric effect of metal promoter contributes to decreasing the size of Pt ensembles or blocking the low-coordinated defect active sites and thereby suppressing the structure-sensitive side reactions, including hydrogenolysis and deep dehydrogenation."

[9] "The electronic effect of promoter is to lower the desorption barrier of alkenes and coke precursors by donating electron to Pt atoms, hindering alkenes adsorption on metal sites and consequently decreasing the likelihood of hydrogenolysis and coking."

          Recent key strategies and approaches developed to enhance the catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts in direct dehydrogenation processes include:

1. Using ceria (CeO2) as a support material: Ceria's high oxygen storage capacity helps suppress coke formation by oxidizing carbon deposits.

2. Doping metal cations into ceria: This regulates the structural and chemical properties of ceria, enhancing its performance as a support material.

3. Adding promoter metals like gallium (Ga): Ga addition reduces catalyst deactivation rates and enhances catalytic stability, primarily through the formation of PtGa alloys.

4. Utilizing geometric and electronic effects of metal promoters:
   - Geometric effect: Decreases the size of metal ensembles or blocks low-coordinated defect sites, suppressing side reactions like hydrogenolysis and deep dehydrogenation.
   - Electronic effect: Lowers the desorption barrier of alkenes and coke precursors, hindering their adsorption on metal sites and reducing the likelihood of hydrogenolysis and coking.

5. Enhancing the reducibility of support materials: Improved reducibility of CeO2 increases its capability to eliminate coke deposition, benefiting catalytic stability.

6. Developing multi-functional catalysts: Doping Pt/CeO2-Al2O3 catalysts with Ga simultaneously enhances the redox properties of CeO2 and modifies the catalytic properties of Pt nanoparticles.

These advancements address challenges in catalyst design, fabrication, and performance optimization for industrial applications by:
- Improving coke resistance and catalyst longevity
- Enhancing selectivity towards desired products (e.g., propylene in propane dehydrogenation)
- Suppressing undesired side reactions
- Optimizing metal-support interactions
- Tuning electronic properties of active sites

The combination of these strategies results in catalysts with improved stability, selectivity, and overall performance for industrial dehydrogenation applications.

          最近在直接脱氢过程中提高负载金属催化剂催化稳定性的关键策略和方法包括：

1. 使用氧化铈（CeO2）作为载体材料：氧化铈的高氧储存能力有助于通过氧化碳沉积物来抑制积碳形成。

2. 将金属阳离子掺杂到氧化铈中：这调节了氧化铈的结构和化学性质，提高其作为载体材料的性能。

3. 添加促进剂金属如镓（Ga）：Ga的添加减少了催化剂失活速率并增强了催化稳定性，主要通过形成PtGa合金实现。

4. 利用金属促进剂的几何和电子效应：
   - 几何效应：减小金属集合体的尺寸或阻塞低配位缺陷位点，抑制副反应如氢解和深度脱氢。
   - 电子效应：降低烯烃和积碳前体的脱附势垒，阻碍它们在金属位点的吸附，减少氢解和积碳的可能性。

5. 增强载体材料的可还原性：提高CeO2的可还原性增加了其消除积碳沉积的能力，有利于催化稳定性。

6. 开发多功能催化剂：用Ga掺杂Pt/CeO2-Al2O3催化剂同时增强了CeO2的氧化还原性能并修饰了Pt纳米颗粒的催化性能。

这些进展通过以下方式解决了催化剂设计、制造和性能优化方面的挑战：
- 提高抗积碳能力和催化剂寿命
- 增强对目标产物的选择性（如丙烷脱氢中的丙烯）
- 抑制不需要的副反应
- 优化金属-载体相互作用
- 调节活性位点的电子性质

这些策略的组合产生了稳定性、选择性和整体性能更佳的催化剂，适用于工业脱氢应用。
