          [1] "We synthesize γ-alumina-supported platinum/copper SAA catalysts by incipient wetness co-impregnation method with a high copper to platinum ratio."

[2] "Single platinum atoms dispersed on copper nanoparticles dramatically enhance the desorption of surface-bounded propylene and prohibit its further dehydrogenation, resulting in high propylene selectivity (90%)."

[3] "Unlike previous reported SAA applications at low temperatures (<400C), Pt/Cu SAA shows excellent stability of more than 120h of operation under atmospheric pressure at 520C."

[4] "Our DFT calculations suggest that Pt/Cu SAA indeed breaks the PtM alloy scaling relationship, which is different from the scaling for conventional Pt alloys during the PDH"

[5] "The Pt/Cu SAA catalyst with the low loading of Pt (0.1wt%) displays propylene selectivity of 90% with the high formation rate of 10.6molg1Pth1 under the conditions of atmospheric pressure, 520C, WHSV=4h1, C3H8/N2=1/1 and shows excellent stability for at least 120h on stream."

[6] "Herein, we report that Pt/Cu single atom alloy (SAA) breaks the PtM alloy scaling relationship during the PDH, with a great improvement of propylene selectivity and a slight loss of intrinsic dehydrogenation activity."

[7] "During the PDH at 520C, the propylene formation rate dramatically dropped from 3.7 to 1.6molg1Pth1 for 0.1Pt/Al2O3 after 12h on stream. As a contrast, we did not observe deactivation for 0.1Pt10Cu/Al2O3 upon 12h on stream and the propylene formation rate only slightly decreased from 10.6 to 10.3molg1Pth1 even after 120h on stream."

[8] "The low deactivation rate of 0.0005h−1 for 0.1Pt10Cu/Al2O3 quantitatively demonstrates its high stability when compared to 0.07h−1 for 0.1Pt/Al2O3"

[9] "The variation trend of CO adsorption behavior is highly consistent with that of the initial activities of the catalysts as the Cu content increases."

          Key strategies and approaches recently developed to enhance catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts in direct dehydrogenation processes include:

1. Development of Single Atom Alloy (SAA) catalysts: Specifically, Pt/Cu SAA catalysts have been designed to break the PtM alloy scaling relationship, improving propylene selectivity while maintaining good dehydrogenation activity.

2. Atomic dilution method: γ-alumina-supported Pt/Cu SAA catalysts are synthesized using incipient wetness co-impregnation with a high copper to platinum ratio. This allows for single platinum atoms to be dispersed on copper nanoparticles.

3. Optimizing metal interactions: The isolated Pt atoms on Cu nanoparticles enhance propylene desorption and inhibit further dehydrogenation, leading to high selectivity (90%).

4. High-temperature stability: Unlike previous SAA applications limited to low temperatures, these Pt/Cu SAA catalysts show excellent stability for over 120 hours at 520°C under atmospheric pressure.

5. Low metal loading: Utilizing a low loading of platinum (0.1wt%) in combination with higher copper content to achieve high catalytic performance.

6. Improved coke resistance: The Pt/Cu SAA catalysts demonstrate significantly better resistance to deactivation compared to traditional Pt catalysts, maintaining high propylene formation rates over extended periods.

7. Breaking the scaling relationship: DFT calculations suggest that Pt/Cu SAA breaks the conventional PtM alloy scaling relationship during propane dehydrogenation (PDH), allowing for simultaneous improvement in activity and selectivity.

8. Characterization techniques: Using advanced characterization methods like CO-DRIFTS to correlate CO adsorption behavior with initial catalyst activities, allowing for optimization of catalyst composition.

These advancements address challenges in catalyst design, fabrication, and performance optimization by:

1. Improving selectivity and stability simultaneously.
2. Enhancing catalyst stability at industrially relevant high temperatures.
3. Optimizing precious metal utilization through atomic-level dispersion and low loading.
4. Balancing activity and selectivity by breaking traditional trade-offs.
5. Providing insights into structure-performance relationships for targeted catalyst development.
6. Potentially reducing the frequency of catalyst regeneration or replacement in industrial processes due to improved stability and coke resistance.

          最近开发的提高直接脱氢过程中负载金属催化剂催化稳定性的关键策略和方法包括：

1. 开发单原子合金（SAA）催化剂：特别是，设计Pt/Cu SAA催化剂以打破PtM合金的定标关系，提高丙烯选择性的同时保持良好的脱氢活性。

2. 原子稀释方法：通过使用高铜铂比的浸渍共浸渍法合成γ-氧化铝负载的Pt/Cu SAA催化剂。这允许单个铂原子分散在铜纳米粒子上。

3. 优化金属相互作用：铜纳米粒子上的孤立铂原子增强了丙烯的脱附并抑制进一步脱氢，从而导致高选择性（90%）。

4. 高温稳定性：与之前仅限于低温应用的SAA不同，这些Pt/Cu SAA催化剂在520°C、大气压下表现出120多小时的优异稳定性。

5. 低金属负载：利用低铂负载（0.1wt%）结合较高的铜含量来实现高催化性能。

6. 提高抗积碳能力：与传统Pt催化剂相比，Pt/Cu SAA催化剂表现出显著更好的抗失活能力，在长时间内保持高丙烯生成率。

7. 打破标度关系：DFT计算表明，Pt/Cu SAA在丙烷脱氢（PDH）过程中打破了传统PtM合金的标度关系，实现了活性和选择性的同时提高。

8. 表征技术：使用先进的表征方法（如CO-DRIFTS）来关联CO吸附行为与催化剂初始活性，从而优化催化剂组成。

这些进展通过以下方式解决了催化剂设计、制造和性能优化方面的挑战：

1. 同时提高选择性和稳定性。
2. 提高催化剂在工业相关高温下的稳定性。
3. 通过原子级分散和低负载优化贵金属利用。
4. 通过打破传统权衡来平衡活性和选择性。
5. 提供结构-性能关系的见解，用于有针对性的催化剂开发。
6. 由于改善的稳定性和抗积碳能力，可能减少工业过程中催化剂再生或更换的频率。
