          [1] "To address this coke-induced deactivation, a regeneration step under an oxidative atmosphere has been incorporated to industrial dehydrogenation processes. This process is relatively straightforward, as coke is easily combusted in air at dehydrogenation reaction temperatures."

[2] "Several strategies have been applied to control coke formation. For example, coke deposition can be dramatically reduced by using a support with little to no Brnsted acidity, or by poisoning the acid sites. Changes in the reaction conditions, such as cofeeding steam, hydrogen, or CO2, can reduce coke formation, whereas high partial pressures of olefins and paraffins exacerbate coke deposition."

[3] "Alternatively, coke deposition can be reduced by adding a promoter element, the addition of Sn to Pt-based dehydrogenation catalysts being the best-known example."

[4] "The addition of Sn to the Pt-based catalyst facilitates this migration by weakening the binding of the hydrocarbon to the metal."

[5] "Tin is by far the most studied promoter, and all of the platinum-based catalyst formulations that are industrially applied include this post-transition metal, the addition of which modifies both the platinum active phase and the support. Essentially, Sn suppresses hydrogenolysis and isomerization reactions, minimizes metal sintering, neutralizes the acidity of the support, and facilitates the diffusion of the coke species from the metal surface to the support."

[6] "The addition of alkaline metals, such as Li, Na, and K, poisons these acid sites, suppressing the formation of coke on the support as shown in Figure 10."

[7] "Operando spectroscopy will provide the means for more sophisticated process control. Indeed, Raman/UVvis spectroscopy can be used to monitor noninvasively the amount and type of coke as the latter forms and accumulates on the catalyst surface."

[8] "An alternative solution lies in the use of solid oxygen carriers, such as CeO2, SbO4, In2O3, WO3, PbOx, Tl2O3, and BiO3, capable of selectively oxidizing the hydrogen evolved by the SHC reaction."

[9] "Another method of removing the hydrogen from the reaction mixture is the introduction of membranes to the reactor system. This approach allows hydrogen to diffuse out of the reactor, shifting the equilibrium toward the desired olefin product."

          Recent strategies and approaches to enhance catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts in direct dehydrogenation processes include:

1. Incorporating regeneration steps: Using oxidative atmospheres to combust coke deposits at dehydrogenation reaction temperatures.

2. Controlling coke formation:
   a. Using supports with minimal Brønsted acidity or poisoning acid sites.
   b. Modifying reaction conditions by cofeeding steam, hydrogen, or CO2.
   c. Adding promoter elements like Sn to Pt-based catalysts.

3. Optimizing catalyst composition:
   a. Adding Sn to Pt catalysts to weaken hydrocarbon binding, suppress side reactions, minimize sintering, and facilitate coke migration.
   b. Incorporating alkaline metals (Li, Na, K) to poison acid sites and suppress coke formation.

4. Advanced monitoring and control:
   Using operando spectroscopy (e.g., Raman/UV-vis) to monitor coke formation in real-time for more sophisticated process control.

5. Novel reactor designs:
   a. Using solid oxygen carriers (e.g., CeO2, In2O3, WO3) to selectively oxidize hydrogen and shift equilibrium.
   b. Introducing membranes to remove hydrogen from the reactor, shifting equilibrium toward olefin products.

These advancements address challenges in catalyst design, fabrication, and performance optimization by targeting the main causes of deactivation (particularly coke formation), modifying catalyst composition and structure, and altering reaction conditions to improve stability and selectivity. They aim to extend catalyst lifetime, increase olefin yields, and enhance overall process efficiency for industrial applications. However, further research is still needed to develop catalysts with even better long-term stability and selectivity for large-scale industrial use.

          最近为提高直接脱氢过程中负载金属催化剂的催化稳定性而开发的策略和方法包括：

1. 引入再生步骤：在脱氢反应温度下使用氧化性气氛燃烧焦炭沉积物。

   a. 使用具有最小Brønsted酸性的载体或毒化酸性位点。
   b. 通过共进料蒸汽、氢气或CO2来改变反应条件。
   c. 向Pt基催化剂中添加Sn等促进剂元素。

3. 优化催化剂组成：
   a. 向Pt催化剂中添加Sn，以减弱碳氢化合物的结合、抑制副反应、最小化烧结，并促进焦炭迁移。
   b. 加入碱金属（Li、Na、K）以毒化酸性位点并抑制焦炭形成。

4. 先进的监测和控制：
   使用原位光谱技术（如拉曼/紫外-可见光谱）实时监测焦炭形成，实现更复杂的过程控制。

5. 新型反应器设计：
   a. 使用固体氧载体（如CeO2、In2O3、WO3）选择性氧化氢气，改变平衡。
   b. 引入膜以从反应器中去除氢气，将平衡转向烯烃产物。

这些进展通过针对主要的失活原因（特别是焦炭形成）、修改催化剂组成和结构、以及改变反应条件来提高稳定性和选择性，从而解决了催化剂设计、制备和性能优化方面的挑战。它们旨在延长催化剂寿命、提高烯烃产率，并提高工业应用中的整体过程效率。然而，仍需进一步研究开发具有更好长期稳定性和选择性的催化剂，以用于大规模工业应用。
