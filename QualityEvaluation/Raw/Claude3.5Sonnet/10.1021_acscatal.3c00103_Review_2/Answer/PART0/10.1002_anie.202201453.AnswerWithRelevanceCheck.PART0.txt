          [1] "The modification of metal oxides by noble metals has been proved to be an effective strategy to improve the low reactivity of metal oxides in catalyzing PDH."

[2] "Researchers have proposed various regulatory mechanisms of noble metals on metal oxides. Gong and co-workers revealed that ZnO was promoted to be a stronger Lewis acid through the electron transfer from metal oxide to Pt, which attenuated the reduction of ZnO and enhanced the stability."

[3] "Kondratenko and co-workers suggested that low hydrogen adsorption energy barrier on Rh was favorable for H2 dissociation into H atoms and spillover onto the surface of ZrO2. Thus, the lattice oxygen was removed from ZrO2 to generate more coordinately unsaturated Zr4+ sites for PDH reaction."

[4] "With trace amounts (<0.15wt%) of noble metals, PDH reaction performance on zirconia can be enhanced prominently."

[5] "The low deactivation rate (kd=0.03h1) at 550C demonstrates its high stability"

[6] "Optimally, 0.03Pt3Ga2O3 catalyst obtains about 97mmolg1h1 of propylene formation rate, which exceeds 25% of the summed contribution of individual 0.03Pt and 3Ga2O3, and achieves the most noticeable synergistic effect."

[7] "The presence of Pt promotes H2 dissociation and surface coverage of hydrogen species, which is beneficial for the activation of CH in propane."

[8] "Weckhuysen and co-workers4a have found that with 1000ppm Pt modification, propane conversion was doubled in comparison with pure Ga2O3."

          Recent key strategies and approaches to enhance catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts in direct dehydrogenation processes include:

1. Modification of metal oxides with noble metals: This has been proven to improve the reactivity of metal oxides in propane dehydrogenation (PDH). Even trace amounts (<0.15 wt%) of noble metals can significantly enhance PDH performance on supports like zirconia.

2. Promoting metal oxides to be stronger Lewis acids: For example, ZnO can be promoted through electron transfer from the metal oxide to Pt, which attenuates ZnO reduction and enhances stability.

3. Facilitating H2 dissociation and spillover: Noble metals like Rh and Pt can lower the hydrogen adsorption energy barrier, promoting H2 dissociation and spillover onto the oxide surface. This can remove lattice oxygen and generate more active sites, beneficial for C-H activation in propane.

4. Optimizing metal loading and creating synergistic effects: For instance, 0.03Pt3Ga2O3 catalyst showed optimal performance, achieving a 25% increase in propylene formation rate compared to individual components.

5. Temperature control: Operating at appropriate temperatures (e.g., 550°C) can result in low deactivation rates, improving catalyst stability.

These advancements address challenges in catalyst design and performance optimization by:
- Enhancing activity, selectivity, and stability of PDH catalysts
- Optimizing metal-support interactions for synergistic effects
- Creating more active sites through structural modifications
- Controlling surface chemistry for better performance
- Balancing metal loading to maximize performance while minimizing the use of expensive noble metals

While further research is needed, these strategies show promise for developing more efficient and stable catalysts for industrial dehydrogenation processes.

          最近提高直接脱氢过程中负载金属催化剂催化稳定性的关键策略和方法包括：

1. 用贵金属修饰金属氧化物：这已被证明可以提高金属氧化物在催化丙烷脱氢（PDH）中的反应活性。即使是微量（<0.15 wt%）的贵金属也能显著提高氧化锆等载体上的PDH性能。

2. 促进金属氧化物成为更强的路易斯酸：例如，通过从金属氧化物到铂的电子转移可以促进氧化锌，这减弱了氧化锌的还原并增强了稳定性。

3. 促进H2解离和溢出：像铑和铂这样的贵金属可以降低氢吸附能垒，促进H2解离和溢出到氧化物表面。这可以除去晶格氧并产生更多活性位点，有利于丙烷中C-H键的活化。

4. 优化金属负载量并创造协同效应：例如，0.03Pt3Ga2O3催化剂显示出最佳性能，其丙烯生成率比单个组分提高25%。

5. 温度控制：在适当的温度下操作（如550°C）可导致低失活率，提高催化剂稳定性。

这些进展通过以下方式解决了催化剂设计和性能优化方面的挑战：
- 提高PDH催化剂的活性、选择性和稳定性
- 优化金属-载体相互作用以产生协同效应
- 通过结构改性创造更多活性位点
- 控制表面化学以获得更好的性能
- 平衡金属负载量以最大化性能，同时最小化昂贵贵金属的使用

虽然还需要进一步研究，但这些策略为开发更高效、更稳定的工业脱氢过程催化剂显示了前景。
