          [1] "The addition of a second metal, such as tin, indium, or gallium, to platinum has been found to be effective in increasing ethene selectivity and suppressing coke formation"

[2] "Both geometric and electronic effects of the second metals have been proposed to explain their roles in modifying the catalyst surface and changing the surface chemistry involved in ethane dehydrogenation"

[3] "Deactivation decreased significantly with decreasing particle size and increasing Sn addition."

[4] "Operating at low residence time resulted in significantly lowered deactivation, attributable to lower coke formation from ethene, and allowed for measurement closer to the true initial activity."

[5] "For a fixed average particle size, the TOF and selectivity of these catalysts for ethene production increased with the content of Sn. These trends are attributed to a combination of geometric and electronic effects brought about by the presence of Sn on the surface of Pt nanoparticles"

[6] "Carbon deposition decreases with decreasing metal particle size and increasing Sn/Pt ratio."

[7] "To produce PtSn bimetallic particles, tin acetylacetonate (Sn(acac)2, 99.9%, Aldrich) was added together with Pt(acac)2 at the start of the procedure."

[8] "TOF was also found to increase with increasing particle size, a trend attributed to differences in the fraction of lower-coordinated surface atoms and in the electronic properties of the particles."

[9] "While ethane dehydrogenation may favor flatter surfaces, the gain in TOF is not significant enough to lose surface area by going to larger particles. Additionally, practical implementation of this system at high conversions suggests that small and Sn-promoted catalysts should be used to avoid coke formation."

          Recent strategies and approaches to enhance the catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts in direct dehydrogenation processes include:

1. Addition of second metals: Incorporating metals like tin, indium, or gallium with platinum increases ethene selectivity and suppresses coke formation. This is attributed to both geometric and electronic effects that modify the catalyst surface and change the surface chemistry involved in ethane dehydrogenation.

2. Particle size control: Decreasing particle size helps reduce deactivation and carbon deposition. However, there's a trade-off as TOF increases with increasing particle size due to differences in the fraction of lower-coordinated surface atoms and electronic properties of the particles.

3. Composition optimization: Increasing the content of the second metal (e.g., Sn in PtSn catalysts) improves turnover frequency (TOF), selectivity, and reduces carbon deposition. The Sn/Pt ratio is a key factor in catalyst performance.

4. Controlled synthesis of bimetallic nanoparticles: Precise methods for producing PtSn bimetallic particles have been developed, allowing for better control over catalyst composition and properties.

5. Operating conditions adjustment: Using low residence time reduces deactivation by minimizing coke formation from ethene and allows for more accurate measurement of true initial catalyst activity.

These advancements address challenges in catalyst design, fabrication, and performance optimization for industrial applications by:

1. Improving selectivity towards desired products and suppressing unwanted side reactions
2. Reducing coke formation and subsequent catalyst deactivation
3. Enhancing catalyst activity (TOF) and stability
4. Providing a better understanding of how particle size, composition, and surface properties affect catalyst performance
5. Offering insights for practical implementation at industrially relevant high conversion conditions

The research suggests that for practical implementation at high conversions, small and Sn-promoted catalysts should be used to balance the trade-offs between activity, selectivity, and resistance to coke formation.

          最近直接脱氢过程中提高负载金属催化剂催化稳定性的策略和方法包括：

1. 添加第二种金属：将锡、铟或镓等金属与铂结合，可以提高乙烯选择性并抑制积碳形成。这归因于几何和电子效应，它们改变了催化剂表面并改变了乙烷脱氢涉及的表面化学性质。

2. 控制粒子尺寸：减小粒子尺寸有助于减少失活和碳沉积。然而，由于低配位表面原子比例和粒子电子性质的差异，TOF随着粒子尺寸的增加而增加，因此存在权衡。

3. 优化组成：增加第二种金属的含量（如PtSn催化剂中的Sn）可以提高转化频率（TOF）、选择性，并减少碳沉积。Sn/Pt比例是催化剂性能的关键因素。

4. 控制双金属纳米粒子的合成：开发了制备PtSn双金属粒子的精确方法，可以更好地控制催化剂的组成和性能。

5. 调整操作条件：使用低停留时间可以通过最小化乙烯形成的积碳来减少失活，并允许更准确地测量真实的初始催化剂活性。

这些进展通过以下方式解决了工业应用中催化剂设计、制造和性能优化的挑战：

1. 提高了对目标产品的选择性并抑制了不需要的副反应
2. 减少了积碳形成和随之而来的催化剂失活
3. 提高了催化剂活性（TOF）和稳定性
4. 提供了对粒子尺寸、组成和表面性质如何影响催化剂性能的更好理解
5. 为工业相关高转化率条件下的实际应用提供了见解

研究表明，对于高转化率的实际应用，应使用小型和Sn促进的催化剂，以平衡活性、选择性和抗积碳能力之间的权衡。
