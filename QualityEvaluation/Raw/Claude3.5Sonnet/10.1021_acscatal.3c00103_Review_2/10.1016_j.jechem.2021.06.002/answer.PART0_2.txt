[1] "Pt-based catalysts are widely used in propane dehydrogenation reaction for the production of propylene. Suppressing irreversible deactivation caused by the sintering of Pt particles under harsh conditions and regeneration process is a significant challenge in this catalyst."

[2] "The coordinatively unsaturated pentacoordinate Al3+ (Al3+penta) can strongly anchor Pt atoms via a formation of Al-O-Pt bond, and thus stabilize the Pt-based particles at the surface of Al2O3."

[3] "The stability and regenerability of Pt-Sn2/meso-Al2O3 are strongly dependent on the content of Al3+penta sites in the Al2O3 structure, and a high level of Al3+penta sites can effectively prevent the agglomeration of Pt-Sn2 clusters into large Pt nanoparticles in the consecutive dehydrogenation-regeneration cycles."

[4] "The Pt-Sn2/meso-Al2O3-600 with the highest level of Al3+penta (50.8%) delivers the best performance in propane dehydrogenation, which exhibits propane conversion of 40% and propylene selectivity above 98% at 570 C with 10 vol% C3H8 and 10 vol% H2 feed."

[5] "A slow deactivation in this catalyst is ascribed to the formation of coke, and the catalytic performance can be fully restored in the consecutive dehydrogenation-regeneration cycles via a simple calcination treatment."

Recent strategies to enhance catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts in direct dehydrogenation processes focus on addressing the challenge of irreversible deactivation caused by sintering of metal particles. One key approach involves the use of highly ordered mesoporous Al2O3 supports with high levels of Al3+penta sites to anchor Pt-Sn2 clusters.

The Al3+penta sites strongly anchor Pt atoms through Al-O-Pt bonds, stabilizing Pt-based particles on the Al2O3 surface. This anchoring mechanism effectively prevents the agglomeration of Pt-Sn2 clusters into larger Pt nanoparticles during dehydrogenation-regeneration cycles, thus maintaining catalyst stability and regenerability.

The content of Al3+penta sites in the Al2O3 structure plays a crucial role in determining the stability and regenerability of the catalyst. Higher levels of Al3+penta sites lead to better performance, with the Pt-Sn2/meso-Al2O3-600 catalyst (containing 50.8% Al3+penta) demonstrating the best results in propane dehydrogenation.

This catalyst design addresses industrial challenges by achieving high propane conversion (40%) and propylene selectivity (above 98%) under realistic conditions (570°C, 10 vol% C3H8, 10 vol% H2 feed). The slow deactivation due to coke formation can be fully reversed through a simple calcination treatment, allowing for multiple dehydrogenation-regeneration cycles without significant loss of performance.

These advancements in catalyst design and fabrication offer promising solutions for improving the stability, performance, and longevity of supported metal catalysts in industrial direct dehydrogenation processes.

最近在直接脱氢过程中提高负载金属催化剂催化稳定性的策略主要集中在解决金属颗粒烧结导致的不可逆失活问题。一个关键方法是使用具有高水平Al3+penta位点的高度有序介孔Al2O3载体来锚定Pt-Sn2簇。

Al3+penta位点通过Al-O-Pt键强烈锚定Pt原子，从而稳定Al2O3表面上的Pt基颗粒。这种锚定机制有效防止了Pt-Sn2簇在脱氢-再生循环过程中聚集成更大的Pt纳米颗粒，从而保持催化剂的稳定性和再生能力。

Al2O3结构中Al3+penta位点的含量在决定催化剂的稳定性和再生能力方面起着关键作用。更高水平的Al3+penta位点会带来更好的性能，其中Pt-Sn2/meso-Al2O3-600催化剂（含50.8%的Al3+penta）在丙烷脱氢中表现最佳。

这种催化剂设计通过在实际条件下（570°C，10 vol% C3H8，10 vol% H2进料）实现高丙烷转化率（40%）和丙烯选择性（98%以上）来解决工业挑战。由于焦炭形成导致的缓慢失活可以通过简单的煅烧处理完全逆转，允许多次脱氢-再生循环而不会显著损失性能。

这些在催化剂设计和制造方面的进展为改善工业直接脱氢过程中负载金属催化剂的稳定性、性能和寿命提供了有前景的解决方案。
