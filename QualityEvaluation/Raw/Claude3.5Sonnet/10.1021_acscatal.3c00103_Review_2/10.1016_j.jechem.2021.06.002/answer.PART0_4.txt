[1] "Pt-based catalysts are widely used in propane dehydrogenation reaction for the production of propylene. Suppressing irreversible deactivation caused by the sintering of Pt particles under harsh conditions and regeneration process is a significant challenge in this catalyst."

[2] "The coordinatively unsaturated pentacoordinate Al3+ (Al3+penta) can strongly anchor Pt atoms via a formation of Al-O-Pt bond, and thus stabilize the Pt-based particles at the surface of Al2O3."

[3] "The stability and regenerability of Pt-Sn2/meso-Al2O3 are strongly dependent on the content of Al3+penta sites in the Al2O3 structure, and a high level of Al3+penta sites can effectively prevent the agglomeration of Pt-Sn2 clusters into large Pt nanoparticles in the consecutive dehydrogenation-regeneration cycles."

[4] "The Pt-Sn2/meso-Al2O3-600 with the highest level of Al3+penta (50.8%) delivers the best performance in propane dehydrogenation, which exhibits propane conversion of 40% and propylene selectivity above 98% at 570 C with 10 vol% C3H8 and 10 vol% H2 feed."

[5] "A slow deactivation in this catalyst is ascribed to the formation of coke, and the catalytic performance can be fully restored in the consecutive dehydrogenation-regeneration cycles via a simple calcination treatment."

Recent advancements in enhancing the catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts for direct dehydrogenation processes focus on addressing the challenge of irreversible deactivation caused by sintering of metal particles under harsh conditions and during regeneration. Key strategies include:

1. Using highly ordered mesoporous Al2O3 supports with different levels of Al3+penta sites to disperse Pt-Sn2 clusters.

2. Leveraging coordinatively unsaturated pentacoordinate Al3+ (Al3+penta) to strongly anchor Pt atoms through Al-O-Pt bond formation, stabilizing Pt-based particles on the Al2O3 surface.

3. Optimizing the content of Al3+penta sites in the Al2O3 structure to prevent agglomeration of Pt-Sn2 clusters into large Pt nanoparticles during consecutive dehydrogenation-regeneration cycles.

4. Developing catalysts with high levels of Al3+penta sites, such as Pt-Sn2/meso-Al2O3-600, which demonstrates excellent performance in propane dehydrogenation.

5. Implementing simple calcination treatments to fully restore catalytic performance in consecutive dehydrogenation-regeneration cycles, addressing the slow deactivation caused by coke formation.

These advancements address challenges in catalyst design, fabrication, and performance optimization by improving stability, regenerability, and overall catalytic performance, making them more suitable for industrial applications in propane dehydrogenation processes.

最近在提高直接脱氢过程中负载金属催化剂的催化稳定性方面的进展主要集中在解决金属颗粒在苛刻条件下和再生过程中烧结导致的不可逆失活问题。主要策略包括：

1. 使用具有不同Al3+五配位位点含量的高度有序介孔Al2O3载体来分散Pt-Sn2簇。

2. 利用配位不饱和的五配位Al3+（Al3+penta）通过形成Al-O-Pt键强烈锚定Pt原子，从而稳定Al2O3表面的Pt基颗粒。

3. 优化Al2O3结构中Al3+penta位点的含量，以防止Pt-Sn2簇在连续脱氢-再生循环中聚集成大的Pt纳米颗粒。

4. 开发具有高含量Al3+penta位点的催化剂，如Pt-Sn2/meso-Al2O3-600，在丙烷脱氢反应中表现出优异的性能。

5. 实施简单的焙烧处理，以在连续脱氢-再生循环中完全恢复催化性能，解决由于焦炭形成导致的缓慢失活问题。

这些进展通过改善稳定性、再生能力和整体催化性能，解决了催化剂设计、制备和性能优化方面的挑战，使其更适合于丙烷脱氢过程的工业应用。
