[1] "Pt-based catalysts are widely used in propane dehydrogenation reaction for the production of propylene. Suppressing irreversible deactivation caused by the sintering of Pt particles under harsh conditions and regeneration process is a significant challenge in this catalyst."

[2] "The coordinatively unsaturated pentacoordinate Al3+ (Al3+penta) can strongly anchor Pt atoms via a formation of Al-O-Pt bond, and thus stabilize the Pt-based particles at the surface of Al2O3."

[3] "The stability and regenerability of Pt-Sn2/meso-Al2O3 are strongly dependent on the content of Al3+penta sites in the Al2O3 structure, and a high level of Al3+penta sites can effectively prevent the agglomeration of Pt-Sn2 clusters into large Pt nanoparticles in the consecutive dehydrogenation-regeneration cycles."

[4] "The Pt-Sn2/meso-Al2O3-600 with the highest level of Al3+penta (50.8%) delivers the best performance in propane dehydrogenation, which exhibits propane conversion of 40% and propylene selectivity above 98% at 570 C with 10 vol% C3H8 and 10 vol% H2 feed."

[5] "A slow deactivation in this catalyst is ascribed to the formation of coke, and the catalytic performance can be fully restored in the consecutive dehydrogenation-regeneration cycles via a simple calcination treatment."

The key strategies and approaches recently developed to enhance the catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts in direct dehydrogenation processes focus on addressing the challenge of irreversible deactivation caused by sintering of Pt particles under harsh conditions and during regeneration. The main advancements include:

1. Utilizing highly ordered mesoporous Al2O3 supports with different levels of Al3+penta sites to disperse Pt-Sn2 clusters.

2. Exploiting the strong anchoring ability of coordinatively unsaturated pentacoordinate Al3+ (Al3+penta) to stabilize Pt atoms through the formation of Al-O-Pt bonds.

3. Optimizing the content of Al3+penta sites in the Al2O3 structure to prevent the agglomeration of Pt-Sn2 clusters into large Pt nanoparticles during consecutive dehydrogenation-regeneration cycles.

4. Developing catalysts with high levels of Al3+penta sites, such as Pt-Sn2/meso-Al2O3-600 with 50.8% Al3+penta, which demonstrates excellent performance in propane dehydrogenation.

5. Implementing a simple calcination treatment to fully restore catalytic performance in consecutive dehydrogenation-regeneration cycles, addressing the slow deactivation caused by coke formation.

These advancements address challenges in catalyst design, fabrication, and performance optimization by improving stability, regenerability, and resistance to sintering, which are crucial for industrial applications in propane dehydrogenation reactions.
