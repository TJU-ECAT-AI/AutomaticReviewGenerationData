[1] "Pt-based catalysts are widely used in propane dehydrogenation reaction for the production of propylene. Suppressing irreversible deactivation caused by the sintering of Pt particles under harsh conditions and regeneration process is a significant challenge in this catalyst."

[2] "The coordinatively unsaturated pentacoordinate Al3+ (Al3+penta) can strongly anchor Pt atoms via a formation of Al-O-Pt bond, and thus stabilize the Pt-based particles at the surface of Al2O3."

[3] "The stability and regenerability of Pt-Sn2/meso-Al2O3 are strongly dependent on the content of Al3+penta sites in the Al2O3 structure, and a high level of Al3+penta sites can effectively prevent the agglomeration of Pt-Sn2 clusters into large Pt nanoparticles in the consecutive dehydrogenation-regeneration cycles."

[4] "The Pt-Sn2/meso-Al2O3-600 with the highest level of Al3+penta (50.8%) delivers the best performance in propane dehydrogenation, which exhibits propane conversion of 40% and propylene selectivity above 98% at 570 C with 10 vol% C3H8 and 10 vol% H2 feed."

[5] "A slow deactivation in this catalyst is ascribed to the formation of coke, and the catalytic performance can be fully restored in the consecutive dehydrogenation-regeneration cycles via a simple calcination treatment."

Recent strategies to enhance catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts in direct dehydrogenation processes focus on addressing the issue of sintering under harsh conditions and during regeneration. A key approach involves the use of highly ordered mesoporous Al2O3 supports with high levels of coordinatively unsaturated pentacoordinate Al3+ (Al3+penta) sites. These sites strongly anchor Pt atoms through Al-O-Pt bonds, stabilizing Pt-based particles on the Al2O3 surface.

The stability and regenerability of the catalyst (Pt-Sn2/meso-Al2O3) are directly related to the content of Al3+penta sites in the Al2O3 structure. A high level of these sites effectively prevents the agglomeration of Pt-Sn2 clusters into larger Pt nanoparticles during consecutive dehydrogenation-regeneration cycles.

The best performance in propane dehydrogenation was achieved with Pt-Sn2/meso-Al2O3-600, which had the highest level of Al3+penta (50.8%). This catalyst showed propane conversion of 40% and propylene selectivity above 98% under specific conditions.

Deactivation of the catalyst is primarily due to coke formation, but catalytic performance can be fully restored through simple calcination treatment in consecutive dehydrogenation-regeneration cycles.

These advancements address challenges in catalyst design and performance optimization by providing a sinter-resistant and regenerable catalyst for industrial applications in propane dehydrogenation.

最近在直接脱氢过程中提高负载金属催化剂催化稳定性的策略主要集中在解决在苛刻条件下和再生过程中的烧结问题。一个关键方法是使用具有高水平配位不饱和五配位Al3+（Al3+penta）位点的高度有序介孔Al2O3载体。这些位点通过Al-O-Pt键强烈锚定Pt原子，稳定了Al2O3表面的Pt基粒子。

催化剂（Pt-Sn2/meso-Al2O3）的稳定性和再生能力与Al2O3结构中Al3+penta位点的含量直接相关。高水平的这些位点可以有效防止Pt-Sn2簇在连续脱氢-再生循环中聚集成更大的Pt纳米粒子。

在丙烷脱氢中，最佳性能是由具有最高Al3+penta水平（50.8%）的Pt-Sn2/meso-Al2O3-600实现的。在特定条件下，该催化剂显示出40%的丙烷转化率和98%以上的丙烯选择性。

催化剂的失活主要是由于积碳形成，但通过简单的焙烧处理，可以在连续脱氢-再生循环中完全恢复催化性能。

这些进展通过提供一种抗烧结和可再生的催化剂，解决了催化剂设计和性能优化方面的挑战，适用于丙烷脱氢的工业应用。

最近在提高直接脱氢过程中负载金属催化剂的催化稳定性方面的进展主要集中在解决harsh条件下和再生过程中的烧结问题。一个关键策略是使用具有不同Al3+penta位点含量的高度有序介孔Al2O3作为载体来分散Pt-Sn2簇。

配位不饱和的五配位Al3+（Al3+penta）位点通过形成强Al-O-Pt键在稳定Al2O3表面的Pt基粒子方面起着至关重要的作用。催化剂的稳定性和可再生性与Al2O3结构中Al3+penta位点的含量直接相关。高含量的这些位点可以有效防止Pt-Sn2簇在连续脱氢-再生循环中聚集成更大的Pt纳米粒子。

在丙烷脱氢反应中，性能最佳的是含有最高Al3+penta含量（50.8%）的Pt-Sn2/meso-Al2O3-600。在特定反应条件下，该催化剂展现出40%的丙烷转化率和98%以上的丙烯选择性。

虽然由于焦炭形成导致的缓慢失活仍然是一个挑战，但通过简单的焙烧处理，可以在连续脱氢-再生循环中完全恢复催化性能。这种方法满足了工业对稳定、高性能催化剂的需求，这些催化剂能够承受harsh条件并在多次再生循环中保持其有效性。

One key approach involves the use of highly ordered mesoporous Al2O3 supports with high levels of Al3+penta sites to anchor Pt-Sn2 clusters.

The Al3+penta sites strongly anchor Pt atoms through Al-O-Pt bonds, stabilizing Pt-based particles on the Al2O3 surface. This anchoring mechanism effectively prevents the agglomeration of Pt-Sn2 clusters into larger Pt nanoparticles during dehydrogenation-regeneration cycles, thus maintaining catalyst stability and regenerability.

The content of Al3+penta sites in the Al2O3 structure plays a crucial role in determining the stability and regenerability of the catalyst. Higher levels of Al3+penta sites lead to better performance, with the Pt-Sn2/meso-Al2O3-600 catalyst (containing 50.8% Al3+penta) demonstrating the best results in propane dehydrogenation.

This catalyst design addresses industrial challenges by achieving high propane conversion (40%) and propylene selectivity (above 98%) under realistic conditions (570°C, 10 vol% C3H8, 10 vol% H2 feed). The slow deactivation due to coke formation can be fully reversed through a simple calcination treatment, allowing for multiple dehydrogenation-regeneration cycles without significant loss of performance.

These advancements in catalyst design and fabrication offer promising solutions for improving the stability, performance, and longevity of supported metal catalysts in industrial direct dehydrogenation processes.

最近在直接脱氢过程中提高负载金属催化剂催化稳定性的策略主要集中在解决金属颗粒烧结导致的不可逆失活问题。一个关键方法是使用具有高水平Al3+penta位点的高度有序介孔Al2O3载体来锚定Pt-Sn2簇。

Al3+penta位点通过Al-O-Pt键强烈锚定Pt原子，从而稳定Al2O3表面上的Pt基颗粒。这种锚定机制有效防止了Pt-Sn2簇在脱氢-再生循环过程中聚集成更大的Pt纳米颗粒，从而保持催化剂的稳定性和再生能力。

Al2O3结构中Al3+penta位点的含量在决定催化剂的稳定性和再生能力方面起着关键作用。更高水平的Al3+penta位点会带来更好的性能，其中Pt-Sn2/meso-Al2O3-600催化剂（含50.8%的Al3+penta）在丙烷脱氢中表现最佳。

这种催化剂设计通过在实际条件下（570°C，10 vol% C3H8，10 vol% H2进料）实现高丙烷转化率（40%）和丙烯选择性（98%以上）来解决工业挑战。由于焦炭形成导致的缓慢失活可以通过简单的煅烧处理完全逆转，允许多次脱氢-再生循环而不会显著损失性能。

这些在催化剂设计和制造方面的进展为改善工业直接脱氢过程中负载金属催化剂的稳定性、性能和寿命提供了有前景的解决方案。
