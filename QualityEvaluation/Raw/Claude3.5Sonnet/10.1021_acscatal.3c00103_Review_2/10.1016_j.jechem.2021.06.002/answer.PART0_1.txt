[1] "Pt-based catalysts are widely used in propane dehydrogenation reaction for the production of propylene. Suppressing irreversible deactivation caused by the sintering of Pt particles under harsh conditions and regeneration process is a significant challenge in this catalyst."

[2] "The coordinatively unsaturated pentacoordinate Al3+ (Al3+penta) can strongly anchor Pt atoms via a formation of Al-O-Pt bond, and thus stabilize the Pt-based particles at the surface of Al2O3."

[3] "The stability and regenerability of Pt-Sn2/meso-Al2O3 are strongly dependent on the content of Al3+penta sites in the Al2O3 structure, and a high level of Al3+penta sites can effectively prevent the agglomeration of Pt-Sn2 clusters into large Pt nanoparticles in the consecutive dehydrogenation-regeneration cycles."

[4] "The Pt-Sn2/meso-Al2O3-600 with the highest level of Al3+penta (50.8%) delivers the best performance in propane dehydrogenation, which exhibits propane conversion of 40% and propylene selectivity above 98% at 570 C with 10 vol% C3H8 and 10 vol% H2 feed."

[5] "A slow deactivation in this catalyst is ascribed to the formation of coke, and the catalytic performance can be fully restored in the consecutive dehydrogenation-regeneration cycles via a simple calcination treatment."

Recent advancements in enhancing the catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts for direct dehydrogenation processes focus on addressing the issue of sintering under harsh conditions and during regeneration. A key strategy involves the use of highly ordered mesoporous Al2O3 supports with different levels of Al3+penta sites to disperse Pt-Sn2 clusters.

The coordinatively unsaturated pentacoordinate Al3+ (Al3+penta) sites play a crucial role in stabilizing Pt-based particles on the Al2O3 surface by forming strong Al-O-Pt bonds. The stability and regenerability of the catalyst are directly correlated with the content of Al3+penta sites in the Al2O3 structure. A high level of these sites effectively prevents the agglomeration of Pt-Sn2 clusters into larger Pt nanoparticles during consecutive dehydrogenation-regeneration cycles.

The best performance in propane dehydrogenation was achieved by Pt-Sn2/meso-Al2O3-600, which contains the highest level of Al3+penta (50.8%). This catalyst demonstrated a propane conversion of 40% and propylene selectivity above 98% under specific reaction conditions.

While slow deactivation due to coke formation remains a challenge, the catalytic performance can be fully restored through simple calcination treatment in consecutive dehydrogenation-regeneration cycles. This approach addresses the industrial need for stable, high-performing catalysts that can withstand harsh conditions and maintain their effectiveness over multiple regeneration cycles.

最近在提高直接脱氢过程中负载金属催化剂的催化稳定性方面的进展主要集中在解决harsh条件下和再生过程中的烧结问题。一个关键策略是使用具有不同Al3+penta位点含量的高度有序介孔Al2O3作为载体来分散Pt-Sn2簇。

配位不饱和的五配位Al3+（Al3+penta）位点通过形成强Al-O-Pt键在稳定Al2O3表面的Pt基粒子方面起着至关重要的作用。催化剂的稳定性和可再生性与Al2O3结构中Al3+penta位点的含量直接相关。高含量的这些位点可以有效防止Pt-Sn2簇在连续脱氢-再生循环中聚集成更大的Pt纳米粒子。

在丙烷脱氢反应中，性能最佳的是含有最高Al3+penta含量（50.8%）的Pt-Sn2/meso-Al2O3-600。在特定反应条件下，该催化剂展现出40%的丙烷转化率和98%以上的丙烯选择性。

虽然由于焦炭形成导致的缓慢失活仍然是一个挑战，但通过简单的焙烧处理，可以在连续脱氢-再生循环中完全恢复催化性能。这种方法满足了工业对稳定、高性能催化剂的需求，这些催化剂能够承受harsh条件并在多次再生循环中保持其有效性。
