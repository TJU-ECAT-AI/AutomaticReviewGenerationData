The given literature does not directly address strategies for enhancing catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts in direct dehydrogenation processes. The text focuses on characterizing vanadia catalysts supported on alumina for n-butane dehydrogenation, but does not discuss recent advancements in improving catalyst stability or industrial applications. The document primarily examines the structure-activity relationships of different vanadia species on the catalyst surface, their transformation during reaction and regeneration, and effects on catalytic performance. It does not cover broader strategies for improving catalyst stability or industrial catalyst design.
