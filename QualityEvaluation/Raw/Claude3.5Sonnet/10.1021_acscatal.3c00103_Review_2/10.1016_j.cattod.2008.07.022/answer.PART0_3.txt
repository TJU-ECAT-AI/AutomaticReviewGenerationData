The given scientific literature does not directly address strategies for enhancing catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts in direct dehydrogenation processes. The text focuses on characterizing vanadium oxide catalysts supported on alumina for n-butane dehydrogenation, but does not discuss recent developments in improving catalyst stability or industrial applications. The document primarily examines the relationship between surface VOx species and catalytic activity, as well as changes in catalyst structure during calcination, reduction, and regeneration. Without additional information on recent advancements in catalyst design and stability enhancement for industrial dehydrogenation processes, this specific question cannot be fully answered based solely on the provided literature.

给定的科学文献并未直接讨论提高直接脱氢过程中负载金属催化剂稳定性的策略。该文本主要集中在表征用于正丁烷脱氢的氧化钒/氧化铝催化剂,但并未讨论近期在提高催化剂稳定性或工业应用方面的发展。该文档主要研究了表面VOx物种与催化活性之间的关系,以及在煅烧、还原和再生过程中催化剂结构的变化。由于缺乏关于工业脱氢过程中催化剂设计和稳定性提高的最新进展的额外信息,仅基于所提供的文献无法全面回答这个具体问题。
