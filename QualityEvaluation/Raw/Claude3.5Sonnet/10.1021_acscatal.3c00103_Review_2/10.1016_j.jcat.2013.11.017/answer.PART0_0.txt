[1] "The addition of a second metal, such as tin, indium, or gallium, to platinum has been found to be effective in increasing ethene selectivity and suppressing coke formation"

[2] "Both geometric and electronic effects of the second metals have been proposed to explain their roles in modifying the catalyst surface and changing the surface chemistry involved in ethane dehydrogenation"

[3] "Deactivation decreased significantly with decreasing particle size and increasing Sn addition."

[4] "Operating at low residence time resulted in significantly lowered deactivation, attributable to lower coke formation from ethene, and allowed for measurement closer to the true initial activity."

[5] "For a fixed average particle size, the TOF and selectivity of these catalysts for ethene production increased with the content of Sn. These trends are attributed to a combination of geometric and electronic effects brought about by the presence of Sn on the surface of Pt nanoparticles"

Recent strategies to enhance catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts in direct dehydrogenation processes include:

1. Addition of second metals: Incorporating metals like tin, indium, or gallium with platinum increases ethene selectivity and suppresses coke formation.

2. Particle size control: Decreasing particle size helps reduce deactivation.

3. Composition optimization: Increasing the content of the second metal (e.g., Sn in PtSn catalysts) improves turnover frequency (TOF) and selectivity.

4. Operating conditions adjustment: Using low residence time reduces deactivation by minimizing coke formation from ethene.

5. Leveraging geometric and electronic effects: The presence of a second metal on the surface of nanoparticles modifies catalyst surface properties and chemistry.

These advancements address challenges in catalyst design and performance optimization by:

1. Improving selectivity towards desired products
2. Reducing coke formation and subsequent catalyst deactivation
3. Enhancing catalyst activity (TOF)
4. Allowing for more accurate measurement of true initial catalyst activity
5. Providing a better understanding of how particle size and composition affect catalyst performance

These strategies contribute to developing more stable and efficient catalysts for industrial applications in direct dehydrogenation processes.
