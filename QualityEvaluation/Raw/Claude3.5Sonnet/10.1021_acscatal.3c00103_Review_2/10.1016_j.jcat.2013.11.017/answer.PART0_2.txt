[1] "The addition of a second metal, such as tin, indium, or gallium, to platinum has been found to be effective in increasing ethene selectivity and suppressing coke formation"

[2] "Carbon deposition decreases with decreasing metal particle size and increasing Sn/Pt ratio."

[3] "Deactivation decreased significantly with decreasing particle size and increasing Sn addition."

[4] "Operating at low residence time resulted in significantly lowered deactivation, attributable to lower coke formation from ethene, and allowed for measurement closer to the true initial activity."

[5] "While ethane dehydrogenation may favor flatter surfaces, the gain in TOF is not significant enough to lose surface area by going to larger particles. Additionally, practical implementation of this system at high conversions suggests that small and Sn-promoted catalysts should be used to avoid coke formation."

Recent strategies to enhance catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts for direct dehydrogenation include:

1. Addition of second metals: Incorporating metals like tin, indium or gallium with platinum increases ethene selectivity and suppresses coke formation.

2. Controlling particle size: Smaller metal particle sizes reduce carbon deposition and deactivation.

3. Optimizing metal ratios: Increasing the Sn/Pt ratio in bimetallic catalysts decreases carbon deposition and deactivation.

4. Low residence time operation: Operating at low residence times reduces deactivation by limiting coke formation from ethene.

5. Balancing particle size effects: While larger particles may have higher turnover frequencies, smaller particles are preferred to maximize surface area and minimize coking at industrially relevant conditions.

These advancements address challenges in catalyst design by providing strategies to suppress coking and deactivation while maintaining or improving activity and selectivity. The approaches allow for better control over catalyst properties and reaction conditions to optimize performance for industrial applications.

最近为提高直接脱氢过程中负载金属催化剂的催化稳定性而开发的策略包括：

1. 添加第二种金属：将锡、铟或镓等金属与铂结合，可以提高乙烯选择性并抑制积碳形成。

2. 控制粒子尺寸：较小的金属粒子尺寸可以减少碳沉积和失活。

3. 优化金属比例：在双金属催化剂中增加Sn/Pt比例可以减少碳沉积和失活。

4. 低停留时间操作：在低停留时间下操作可以通过限制乙烯的积碳形成来减少失活。

5. 平衡粒子尺寸效应：虽然较大的粒子可能具有更高的转化频率，但在工业相关条件下，较小的粒子更受青睐，以最大化表面积并最小化积碳。

这些进展通过提供抑制积碳和失活的策略，同时保持或改善活性和选择性，解决了催化剂设计中的挑战。这些方法允许更好地控制催化剂性质和反应条件，以优化工业应用的性能。
