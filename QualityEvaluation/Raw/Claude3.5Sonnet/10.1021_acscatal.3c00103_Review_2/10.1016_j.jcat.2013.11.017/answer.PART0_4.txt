[1] "The addition of a second metal, such as tin, indium, or gallium, to platinum has been found to be effective in increasing ethene selectivity and suppressing coke formation"

[2] "With decreasing particle size and Sn addition, deactivation decreased significantly, an effect more pronounced at high residence time conditions."

[3] "Operating at low residence time resulted in significantly lowered deactivation, attributable to lower coke formation from ethene, and allowed for measurement closer to the true initial activity."

[4] "TOF was also found to increase with increasing particle size, a trend attributed to differences in the fraction of lower-coordinated surface atoms and in the electronic properties of the particles."

[5] "While ethane dehydrogenation may favor flatter surfaces, the gain in TOF is not significant enough to lose surface area by going to larger particles. Additionally, practical implementation of this system at high conversions suggests that small and Sn-promoted catalysts should be used to avoid coke formation."

Key strategies and approaches recently developed to enhance catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts in direct dehydrogenation processes include:

1. Addition of a second metal (e.g. tin, indium, gallium) to platinum to increase ethene selectivity and suppress coke formation.

2. Decreasing particle size and adding Sn to reduce deactivation, especially at high residence times.

3. Operating at low residence times to lower deactivation by reducing coke formation from ethene.

4. Optimizing particle size: While larger particles show higher turnover frequency (TOF), smaller particles provide more surface area and resist coke formation better.

5. Using small, Sn-promoted catalysts for practical implementation at high conversions to avoid coke formation.

These advancements address challenges in catalyst design, fabrication and performance optimization by:

1. Improving selectivity and stability through bimetallic formulations.
2. Controlling particle size to balance activity and resistance to coking.
3. Optimizing reaction conditions (e.g. residence time) to minimize deactivation.
4. Providing insights into structure-performance relationships to guide rational catalyst design.

最近开发的提高直接脱氢过程中负载金属催化剂催化稳定性的关键策略和方法包括：

1. 向铂中添加第二种金属（如锡、铟、镓）以提高乙烯选择性并抑制积碳形成。

2. 减小颗粒尺寸并添加Sn以减少失活，尤其是在高停留时间条件下。

3. 在低停留时间下操作，通过减少乙烯的积碳形成来降低失活。

4. 优化颗粒尺寸：虽然较大的颗粒显示出更高的转化频率（TOF），但较小的颗粒提供更多的表面积并更好地抵抗积碳形成。

5. 在高转化率的实际应用中使用小型、Sn促进的催化剂以避免积碳形成。

这些进展通过以下方式解决了催化剂设计、制造和性能优化方面的挑战：

1. 通过双金属配方提高选择性和稳定性。
2. 控制颗粒尺寸以平衡活性和抗积碳能力。
3. 优化反应条件（如停留时间）以最小化失活。
4. 提供结构-性能关系的见解，指导合理的催化剂设计。
