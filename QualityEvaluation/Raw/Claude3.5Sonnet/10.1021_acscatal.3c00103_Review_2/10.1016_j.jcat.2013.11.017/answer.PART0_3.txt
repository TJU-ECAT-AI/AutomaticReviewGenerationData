[1] "The addition of a second metal, such as tin, indium, or gallium, to platinum has been found to be effective in increasing ethene selectivity and suppressing coke formation"

[2] "To produce PtSn bimetallic particles, tin acetylacetonate (Sn(acac)2, 99.9%, Aldrich) was added together with Pt(acac)2 at the start of the procedure."

[3] "With decreasing particle size and Sn addition, deactivation decreased significantly, an effect more pronounced at high residence time conditions."

[4] "Operating at low residence time resulted in significantly lowered deactivation, attributable to lower coke formation from ethene, and allowed for measurement closer to the true initial activity."

[5] "While ethane dehydrogenation may favor flatter surfaces, the gain in TOF is not significant enough to lose surface area by going to larger particles. Additionally, practical implementation of this system at high conversions suggests that small and Sn-promoted catalysts should be used to avoid coke formation."

Recent strategies to enhance catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts in direct dehydrogenation processes include:

1. Addition of promoter metals: Incorporating metals like tin, indium, or gallium into platinum catalysts has been shown to improve ethene selectivity and reduce coke formation.

2. Controlled synthesis of bimetallic nanoparticles: Precise methods for producing PtSn bimetallic particles have been developed, allowing for better control over catalyst composition and properties.

3. Optimization of particle size: Smaller particle sizes, combined with promoter metal addition, have been found to significantly decrease catalyst deactivation, especially under high residence time conditions.

4. Low residence time operation: Running reactions at low residence times reduces deactivation by minimizing coke formation from ethene, allowing for more accurate measurement of initial catalyst activity.

5. Balancing particle size and surface area: While larger particles may have higher turnover frequencies, the benefits are outweighed by the loss in surface area. For practical applications at high conversions, small and promoter-metal modified catalysts are recommended to minimize coke formation.

These advancements address challenges in catalyst design and performance by providing methods to control catalyst composition, particle size, and reaction conditions, ultimately leading to more stable and selective catalysts for industrial dehydrogenation processes.

最近在直接脱氢过程中提高负载金属催化剂催化稳定性的策略包括：

1. 添加助催化金属：将锡、铟或镓等金属掺入铂催化剂中，已证明可以提高乙烯选择性并减少积碳形成。

2. 控制双金属纳米粒子的合成：开发了制备PtSn双金属粒子的精确方法，可以更好地控制催化剂的组成和性能。

3. 优化粒子尺寸：较小的粒子尺寸与助催化金属的添加相结合，已被发现可以显著减少催化剂失活，特别是在高停留时间条件下。

4. 低停留时间操作：在低停留时间下进行反应可以减少失活，这是通过最小化乙烯形成的积碳来实现的，从而允许更准确地测量催化剂的初始活性。

5. 平衡粒子尺寸和表面积：虽然较大的粒子可能具有更高的转化频率，但这种优势被表面积的损失所抵消。对于高转化率的实际应用，建议使用小尺寸和添加助催化金属改性的催化剂，以最大程度地减少积碳形成。

这些进展通过提供控制催化剂组成、粒子尺寸和反应条件的方法来解决催化剂设计和性能方面的挑战，最终导致更稳定和选择性更高的工业脱氢过程催化剂。
