[1] "The addition of a second metal, such as tin, indium, or gallium, to platinum has been found to be effective in increasing ethene selectivity and suppressing coke formation"

[2] "Both geometric and electronic effects of the second metals have been proposed to explain their roles in modifying the catalyst surface and changing the surface chemistry involved in ethane dehydrogenation"

[3] "Deactivation decreased significantly with decreasing particle size and increasing Sn addition."

[4] "Operating at low residence time resulted in significantly lowered deactivation, attributable to lower coke formation from ethene, and allowed for measurement closer to the true initial activity."

[5] "While ethane dehydrogenation may favor flatter surfaces, the gain in TOF is not significant enough to lose surface area by going to larger particles. Additionally, practical implementation of this system at high conversions suggests that small and Sn-promoted catalysts should be used to avoid coke formation."

Recent strategies to enhance catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts in direct dehydrogenation processes include:

1. Addition of second metals: Incorporating metals like tin, indium, or gallium into platinum catalysts has been shown to increase ethene selectivity and suppress coke formation.

2. Optimizing particle size: Smaller particle sizes have been found to decrease deactivation significantly. 

3. Promotion with tin (Sn): Increasing the Sn content in PtSn catalysts has been demonstrated to reduce coke formation and improve catalyst stability.

4. Low residence time operation: Operating at low residence times reduces deactivation by minimizing coke formation from ethene.

5. Balancing particle size and surface area: While larger particles may show higher turnover frequencies (TOF), smaller particles are preferred for their increased surface area and reduced coke formation at high conversions.

These advancements address challenges in catalyst design and performance optimization by:

- Modifying surface chemistry through geometric and electronic effects of added metals
- Controlling particle size to balance activity and stability
- Enabling more accurate measurement of true initial catalyst activity
- Providing insights for practical implementation at industrially relevant high conversion conditions
