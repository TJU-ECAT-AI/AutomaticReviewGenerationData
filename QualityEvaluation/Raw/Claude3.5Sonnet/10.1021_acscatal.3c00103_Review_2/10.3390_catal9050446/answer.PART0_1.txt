[1] "The Pt catalyst used in the PDH process is often impregnated with Sn as a co-catalyst [7,8,9,10,11]. Because the Ptalkene interaction is stronger than the Ptalkane interaction, unwanted side reactions such as hydrogenolysis and isomerization often occur [12]. When Sn is added to a Pt/Al2O3 catalyst, the Ptalkene interaction is weakened and side reactions are suppressed [13,14,15,16,17]."

[2] "Deng and coworkers [10,21,22] used a direct reduction method to prepare PDH catalysts, which did not include a calcination step, unlike the conventional protocol for catalyst preparation involving drying, calcination, and reduction."

[3] "They applied a hydrogen reduction stage at high temperature (800 C) immediately after drying the catalyst without a calcination step. The direct reduction method yielded a catalyst with much higher performance than the conventionally calcined catalyst considering propane conversion, as well as propylene selectivity."

[4] "It has been reported [24] that the first peak near 417 C can be attributed to coke combustion on either Pt or PtSn alloy sites, whereas the second peak near 494.4 C is due to the "drain-off" effect. Here, drain-off is the case of the coke on metal sites migrating to the oxide support."

[5] "Zhu et al. [9] reported a Sn-surface-enriched PtSn bimetallic nanoparticle catalyst prepared on a MgAl2O4 support using an organometallic chemistry concept, and the catalyst exhibited high selectivity and stability during the PDH reaction."

Recent strategies to enhance the catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts in direct dehydrogenation processes include:

1. Addition of co-catalysts: Impregnating Pt catalysts with Sn as a co-catalyst helps weaken Pt-alkene interactions, suppressing unwanted side reactions like hydrogenolysis and isomerization.

2. Direct reduction method: This approach skips the calcination step in catalyst preparation, instead applying high-temperature hydrogen reduction immediately after drying. This method has shown to yield catalysts with higher performance in terms of propane conversion and propylene selectivity.

3. Controlling alloy formation: The direct reduction method can lead to the formation of different PtSn alloys (e.g., Pt3Sn), which can affect catalyst performance.

4. Coke management: Understanding and utilizing the "drain-off" effect, where coke migrates from metal sites to the oxide support, can help maintain catalyst activity over time.

5. Surface enrichment: Preparing Sn-surface-enriched PtSn bimetallic nanoparticle catalysts has shown promise in improving selectivity and stability during dehydrogenation reactions.

These advancements address challenges in catalyst design and performance optimization by focusing on improving metal dispersion, controlling alloy formation, managing coke deposition, and enhancing catalyst stability. They aim to create catalysts with higher activity, selectivity, and longer lifetimes for industrial applications.

最近提高直接脱氢过程中负载金属催化剂催化稳定性的策略包括：

1. 添加助催化剂：用Sn作为助催化剂浸渍Pt催化剂有助于减弱Pt-烯烃相互作用，抑制不需要的副反应，如氢解和异构化。

2. 直接还原法：这种方法跳过了催化剂制备中的焙烧步骤，而是在干燥后立即进行高温氢还原。这种方法已证明能产生具有更高丙烷转化率和丙烯选择性性能的催化剂。

3. 控制合金形成：直接还原法可导致不同PtSn合金（如Pt3Sn）的形成，这可能影响催化剂性能。

4. 焦炭管理：理解并利用"流失"效应，即焦炭从金属位点迁移到氧化物载体上，可以帮助长期维持催化剂活性。

5. 表面富集：制备Sn表面富集的PtSn双金属纳米粒子催化剂已显示出在提高脱氢反应的选择性和稳定性方面的前景。

这些进展通过关注改善金属分散、控制合金形成、管理焦炭沉积和提高催化剂稳定性，解决了催化剂设计和性能优化方面的挑战。它们旨在为工业应用创造具有更高活性、选择性和更长寿命的催化剂。
