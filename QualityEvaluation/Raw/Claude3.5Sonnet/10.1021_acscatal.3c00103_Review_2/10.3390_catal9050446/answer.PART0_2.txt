[1] "When Sn is added to a Pt/Al2O3 catalyst, the Ptalkene interaction is weakened and side reactions are suppressed [13,14,15,16,17]. Thus, Sn may enhance the propylene selectivity of the PDH reaction [18,19]."

[2] "It has also been reported that Sn plays important roles in preventing Pt sintering, lowering the acidity of the oxide support, and removing the coke generated during the PDH process [4,20]."

[3] "Deng and coworkers [10,21,22] used a direct reduction method to prepare PDH catalysts, which did not include a calcination step, unlike the conventional protocol for catalyst preparation involving drying, calcination, and reduction."

[4] "The direct reduction method yielded a catalyst with much higher performance than the conventionally calcined catalyst considering propane conversion, as well as propylene selectivity."

[5] "As shown in Figure 2, the propylene selectivity values determined after 1 h were in the order of SR500 > SR550 > SR600 > Cal600 > SR450 > SR800 > SR900."

Recent strategies to enhance catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts in direct dehydrogenation processes include:

1. Addition of Sn to Pt/Al2O3 catalysts: This weakens Pt-alkene interactions, suppresses side reactions, and enhances propylene selectivity. Sn also helps prevent Pt sintering, lowers support acidity, and assists in coke removal.

2. Direct reduction method: This approach omits the calcination step in catalyst preparation, instead using only drying followed by high-temperature reduction. This method has been shown to produce catalysts with higher performance in terms of propane conversion and propylene selectivity compared to conventionally calcined catalysts.

3. Optimization of reduction temperature: The study found that direct reduction at specific temperatures (e.g., 500-550°C) resulted in better catalyst performance. This suggests that careful control of the reduction process can lead to improved catalyst design.

4. Formation of specific alloys: The direct reduction method promotes the formation of Pt3Sn alloys, which are associated with improved catalytic activity. Controlling the Pt/Sn ratio and reduction conditions can help optimize the alloy composition for better performance.

5. Particle size control: The direct reduction method results in smaller, more uniformly distributed metal particles compared to conventional methods. This leads to increased metal-support interactions and better catalytic performance.

These advancements address challenges in catalyst design and fabrication by providing methods to better control metal particle size, distribution, and alloy formation. They also offer ways to enhance catalyst stability and selectivity, which are crucial for optimizing performance in industrial applications. The improvements in propane conversion and propylene selectivity directly address the need for more efficient and stable catalysts in dehydrogenation processes.

最近为提高直接脱氢过程中负载金属催化剂的催化稳定性而开发的关键策略和方法包括：

1. 向Pt/Al2O3催化剂中添加Sn：这种方法可以减弱Pt-烯烃相互作用，抑制副反应，并提高丙烯选择性。Sn还有助于防止Pt烧结，降低载体酸度，并协助去除积碳。

2. 直接还原法：这种方法省略了催化剂制备中的焙烧步骤，而只采用干燥后直接高温还原。这种方法已被证明可以生产出在丙烷转化率和丙烯选择性方面性能更高的催化剂，相比于传统焙烧的催化剂。

3. 优化还原温度：研究发现，在特定温度下（如500-550°C）进行直接还原可以获得更好的催化剂性能。这表明对还原过程的精确控制可以改进催化剂设计。

4. 形成特定合金：直接还原法促进了Pt3Sn合金的形成，这种合金与改善的催化活性相关。通过控制Pt/Sn比例和还原条件，可以帮助优化合金组成以获得更好的性能。

5. 粒子尺寸控制：与传统方法相比，直接还原法可以得到更小、分布更均匀的金属粒子。这导致金属-载体相互作用增强，催化性能更好。

这些进展通过提供更好地控制金属粒子尺寸、分布和合金形成的方法，解决了催化剂设计和制造中的挑战。它们还提供了增强催化剂稳定性和选择性的方法，这对于优化工业应用中的性能至关重要。丙烷转化率和丙烯选择性的提高直接解决了脱氢过程中对更高效、更稳定催化剂的需求。
