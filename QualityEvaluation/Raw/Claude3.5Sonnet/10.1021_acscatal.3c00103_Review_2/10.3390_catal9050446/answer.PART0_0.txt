[1] "When Sn is added to a Pt/Al2O3 catalyst, the Ptalkene interaction is weakened and side reactions are suppressed [13,14,15,16,17]. Thus, Sn may enhance the propylene selectivity of the PDH reaction [18,19]."

[2] "It has also been reported that Sn plays important roles in preventing Pt sintering, lowering the acidity of the oxide support, and removing the coke generated during the PDH process [4,20]."

[3] "Deng and coworkers [10,21,22] used a direct reduction method to prepare PDH catalysts, which did not include a calcination step, unlike the conventional protocol for catalyst preparation involving drying, calcination, and reduction."

[4] "The direct reduction method yielded a catalyst with much higher performance than the conventionally calcined catalyst considering propane conversion, as well as propylene selectivity."

[5] "We suspect that the interaction between propane and the PtSn alloys is greater for the Pt3Sn alloy than the PtSn alloy. Thus, the greater number of interactions enhances the PDH reaction and more coke is formed."

[6] "When coke accumulates, the metal sites become covered, which could inhibit the PDH reaction. If drain-off occurs, the active sites of catalysts are recovered."

Recent strategies to enhance catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts in direct dehydrogenation processes include:

1. Adding Sn to Pt/Al2O3 catalysts: This weakens Pt-alkene interactions, suppresses side reactions, and enhances propylene selectivity. Sn also helps prevent Pt sintering, lowers support acidity, and aids in coke removal.

2. Direct reduction method: This approach skips the calcination step, resulting in catalysts with higher performance in terms of propane conversion and propylene selectivity compared to conventional calcined catalysts.

3. Formation of Pt3Sn alloys: These alloys show stronger interactions with propane, enhancing the dehydrogenation reaction. However, this also leads to increased coke formation.

4. Coke management through "drain-off" effect: While coke accumulation can cover active sites and inhibit the reaction, the drain-off effect allows coke to migrate from metal sites to the support, helping to recover active sites.

5. Optimizing reduction temperature: The study found that direct reduction at 550°C produced the best-performing catalyst (SR550), suggesting that careful control of preparation conditions is crucial.

6. Improving metal dispersion: The direct reduction method results in smaller, more dispersed metal particles, which can increase catalyst activity.

These advancements address challenges in catalyst design by improving selectivity, enhancing coke resistance, and optimizing metal-support interactions. They also offer new fabrication methods that can potentially simplify production processes. For industrial applications, these strategies aim to improve catalyst longevity, increase yield, and potentially reduce costs associated with frequent catalyst regeneration or replacement.

最近为提高直接脱氢过程中负载金属催化剂的催化稳定性而开发的关键策略和方法包括：

1. 向Pt/Al2O3催化剂中添加Sn：这降低了Pt-烯烃相互作用，抑制了副反应，并提高了丙烯选择性。Sn还有助于防止Pt烧结，降低载体酸度，并有助于焦炭去除。

2. 直接还原法：这种方法跳过了煅烧步骤，与传统煅烧催化剂相比，能生产出在丙烷转化率和丙烯选择性方面具有更高性能的催化剂。

3. 形成Pt3Sn合金：这些合金与丙烷表现出更强的相互作用，增强了脱氢反应。然而，这也导致了焦炭形成的增加。

4. 通过"流失"效应管理焦炭：虽然焦炭积累会覆盖活性位点并抑制反应，但流失效应允许焦炭从金属位点迁移到载体上，有助于恢复活性位点。

5. 优化还原温度：研究发现，在550°C下直接还原产生了性能最佳的催化剂（SR550），这表明仔细控制制备条件至关重要。

6. 改善金属分散度：直接还原法产生了更小、分散性更好的金属颗粒，可以提高催化剂活性。

这些进展通过改善选择性、增强抗焦性能和优化金属-载体相互作用来解决催化剂设计中的挑战。它们还提供了可能简化生产过程的新制造方法。对于工业应用，这些策略旨在提高催化剂寿命，增加产率，并可能降低与频繁催化剂再生或更换相关的成本。
