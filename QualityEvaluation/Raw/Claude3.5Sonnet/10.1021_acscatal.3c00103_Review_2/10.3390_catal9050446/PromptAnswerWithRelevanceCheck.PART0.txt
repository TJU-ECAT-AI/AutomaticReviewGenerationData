[1] "When Sn is added to a Pt/Al2O3 catalyst, the Ptalkene interaction is weakened and side reactions are suppressed [13,14,15,16,17]. Thus, Sn may enhance the propylene selectivity of the PDH reaction [18,19]."

[2] "It has also been reported that Sn plays important roles in preventing Pt sintering, lowering the acidity of the oxide support, and removing the coke generated during the PDH process [4,20]."

[3] "Deng and coworkers [10,21,22] used a direct reduction method to prepare PDH catalysts, which did not include a calcination step, unlike the conventional protocol for catalyst preparation involving drying, calcination, and reduction."

[4] "The direct reduction method yielded a catalyst with much higher performance than the conventionally calcined catalyst considering propane conversion, as well as propylene selectivity."

[5] "We suspect that the interaction between propane and the PtSn alloys is greater for the Pt3Sn alloy than the PtSn alloy. Thus, the greater number of interactions enhances the PDH reaction and more coke is formed."

[6] "When coke accumulates, the metal sites become covered, which could inhibit the PDH reaction. If drain-off occurs, the active sites of catalysts are recovered."

Recent strategies to enhance catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts in direct dehydrogenation processes include:

1. Adding Sn to Pt/Al2O3 catalysts: This weakens Pt-alkene interactions, suppresses side reactions, and enhances propylene selectivity. Sn also helps prevent Pt sintering, lowers support acidity, and aids in coke removal.

2. Direct reduction method: This approach skips the calcination step, resulting in catalysts with higher performance in terms of propane conversion and propylene selectivity compared to conventional calcined catalysts.

3. Formation of Pt3Sn alloys: These alloys show stronger interactions with propane, enhancing the dehydrogenation reaction. However, this also leads to increased coke formation.

4. Coke management through "drain-off" effect: While coke accumulation can cover active sites and inhibit the reaction, the drain-off effect allows coke to migrate from metal sites to the support, helping to recover active sites.

5. Optimizing reduction temperature: The study found that direct reduction at 550°C produced the best-performing catalyst (SR550), suggesting that careful control of preparation conditions is crucial.

6. Improving metal dispersion: The direct reduction method results in smaller, more dispersed metal particles, which can increase catalyst activity.

These advancements address challenges in catalyst design by improving selectivity, enhancing coke resistance, and optimizing metal-support interactions. They also offer new fabrication methods that can potentially simplify production processes. For industrial applications, these strategies aim to improve catalyst longevity, increase yield, and potentially reduce costs associated with frequent catalyst regeneration or replacement.

[1] "The Pt catalyst used in the PDH process is often impregnated with Sn as a co-catalyst [7,8,9,10,11]. Because the Ptalkene interaction is stronger than the Ptalkane interaction, unwanted side reactions such as hydrogenolysis and isomerization often occur [12]. When Sn is added to a Pt/Al2O3 catalyst, the Ptalkene interaction is weakened and side reactions are suppressed [13,14,15,16,17]."

[2] "Deng and coworkers [10,21,22] used a direct reduction method to prepare PDH catalysts, which did not include a calcination step, unlike the conventional protocol for catalyst preparation involving drying, calcination, and reduction."

[3] "They applied a hydrogen reduction stage at high temperature (800 C) immediately after drying the catalyst without a calcination step. The direct reduction method yielded a catalyst with much higher performance than the conventionally calcined catalyst considering propane conversion, as well as propylene selectivity."

[4] "It has been reported [24] that the first peak near 417 C can be attributed to coke combustion on either Pt or PtSn alloy sites, whereas the second peak near 494.4 C is due to the "drain-off" effect. Here, drain-off is the case of the coke on metal sites migrating to the oxide support."

[5] "Zhu et al. [9] reported a Sn-surface-enriched PtSn bimetallic nanoparticle catalyst prepared on a MgAl2O4 support using an organometallic chemistry concept, and the catalyst exhibited high selectivity and stability during the PDH reaction."

Recent strategies to enhance the catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts in direct dehydrogenation processes include:

1. Addition of co-catalysts: Impregnating Pt catalysts with Sn as a co-catalyst helps weaken Pt-alkene interactions, suppressing unwanted side reactions like hydrogenolysis and isomerization.

2. Direct reduction method: This approach skips the calcination step in catalyst preparation, instead applying high-temperature hydrogen reduction immediately after drying. This method has shown to yield catalysts with higher performance in terms of propane conversion and propylene selectivity.

3. Controlling alloy formation: The direct reduction method can lead to the formation of different PtSn alloys (e.g., Pt3Sn), which can affect catalyst performance.

4. Coke management: Understanding and utilizing the "drain-off" effect, where coke migrates from metal sites to the oxide support, can help maintain catalyst activity over time.

5. Surface enrichment: Preparing Sn-surface-enriched PtSn bimetallic nanoparticle catalysts has shown promise in improving selectivity and stability during dehydrogenation reactions.

These advancements address challenges in catalyst design and performance optimization by focusing on improving metal dispersion, controlling alloy formation, managing coke deposition, and enhancing catalyst stability.
