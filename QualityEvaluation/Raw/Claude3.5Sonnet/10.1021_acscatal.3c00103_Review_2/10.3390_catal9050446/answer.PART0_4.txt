[1] "When Sn is added to a Pt/Al2O3 catalyst, the Ptalkene interaction is weakened and side reactions are suppressed [13,14,15,16,17]. Thus, Sn may enhance the propylene selectivity of the PDH reaction [18,19]."

[2] "It has also been reported that Sn plays important roles in preventing Pt sintering, lowering the acidity of the oxide support, and removing the coke generated during the PDH process [4,20]."

[3] "The direct reduction method yielded a catalyst with much higher performance than the conventionally calcined catalyst considering propane conversion, as well as propylene selectivity."

[4] "They reported that the Pt3Sn alloy formed by direct reduction was responsible for the observed enhancement in catalytic activity."

[5] "The SR550 catalyst has well-dispersed PtSn alloys, which are responsible for the high activity for the PDH reaction."

[6] "We suspect that the interaction between propane and the PtSn alloys is greater for the Pt3Sn alloy than the PtSn alloy. Thus, the greater number of interactions enhances the PDH reaction and more coke is formed."

[7] "We can propose that the synergistic effect of the interaction of Pt and Sn covering the surface of Pt, as well as the accessible Pt sites, could improve the dehydrogenation performance of the catalyst prepared by the direct reduction method."

Recent strategies to enhance catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts in direct dehydrogenation processes include:

1. Addition of Sn to Pt/Al2O3 catalysts: This weakens Pt-alkene interactions, suppresses side reactions, and enhances propylene selectivity. Sn also helps prevent Pt sintering, lowers support acidity, and aids in coke removal.

2. Direct reduction method: This approach yields catalysts with higher performance in terms of propane conversion and propylene selectivity compared to conventional calcination methods. 

3. Formation of Pt3Sn alloys: These alloys, formed through direct reduction, are responsible for enhanced catalytic activity.

4. Optimization of reduction temperature: For example, SR550 (directly reduced at 550°C) showed well-dispersed PtSn alloys leading to high activity.

5. Leveraging Pt3Sn alloy interactions: The stronger interaction between propane and Pt3Sn alloys (compared to PtSn) enhances the dehydrogenation reaction.

6. Surface engineering: Creating a synergistic effect between Pt and Sn, where Sn covers the Pt surface while maintaining accessible Pt sites, improves dehydrogenation performance.

These advancements address challenges in catalyst design by improving selectivity, stability, and coke resistance. They optimize performance through better metal dispersion, alloy formation, and surface interactions. For industrial applications, these strategies offer potential for more efficient and durable catalysts in direct dehydrogenation processes.

最近在直接脱氢过程中提高负载金属催化剂催化稳定性的关键策略和方法包括：

1. 向Pt/Al2O3催化剂中添加Sn：这可以减弱Pt-烯烃相互作用，抑制副反应，并提高丙烯选择性。Sn还有助于防止Pt烧结，降低载体酸度，并有助于除焦。

2. 直接还原法：与传统煅烧方法相比，这种方法制备的催化剂在丙烷转化率和丙烯选择性方面表现更好。

3. 形成Pt3Sn合金：通过直接还原形成的这些合金负责提高催化活性。

4. 优化还原温度：例如，SR550（550°C直接还原）显示出分散良好的PtSn合金，导致高活性。

5. 利用Pt3Sn合金相互作用：丙烷与Pt3Sn合金的相互作用比与PtSn更强，从而增强脱氢反应。

6. 表面工程：在Sn覆盖Pt表面的同时保持可接触的Pt位点，创造Pt和Sn之间的协同效应，提高脱氢性能。

这些进展通过提高选择性、稳定性和抗积碳能力解决了催化剂设计的挑战。它们通过更好的金属分散、合金形成和表面相互作用来优化性能。对于工业应用，这些策略为直接脱氢过程中更高效和更耐用的催化剂提供了潜力。
