[1] "When Sn is added to a Pt/Al2O3 catalyst, the Ptalkene interaction is weakened and side reactions are suppressed [13,14,15,16,17]. Thus, Sn may enhance the propylene selectivity of the PDH reaction [18,19]."

[2] "It has also been reported that Sn plays important roles in preventing Pt sintering, lowering the acidity of the oxide support, and removing the coke generated during the PDH process [4,20]."

[3] "Deng and coworkers [10,21,22] used a direct reduction method to prepare PDH catalysts, which did not include a calcination step, unlike the conventional protocol for catalyst preparation involving drying, calcination, and reduction."

[4] "The direct reduction method yielded a catalyst with much higher performance than the conventionally calcined catalyst considering propane conversion, as well as propylene selectivity."

[5] "In our previous study [23], we reported that oxychlorination treatment was effective in regenerating PtSn/Al2O3 catalysts after the PDH reaction, and we observed that catalysts containing Pt3Sn alloys after oxychlorination treatment showed improved PDH activity."

Recent strategies to enhance catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts in direct dehydrogenation processes include:

1. Adding Sn to Pt/Al2O3 catalysts: This weakens Pt-alkene interactions, suppresses side reactions, and enhances propylene selectivity. Sn also prevents Pt sintering, lowers support acidity, and aids in coke removal.

2. Direct reduction method: This approach skips the calcination step in catalyst preparation, resulting in higher performance in terms of propane conversion and propylene selectivity compared to conventional calcined catalysts.

3. Formation of Pt3Sn alloys: Catalysts containing these alloys have shown improved PDH activity.

4. Oxychlorination treatment: This has been effective in regenerating PtSn/Al2O3 catalysts after the PDH reaction.

5. Optimizing reduction temperatures: The study found that direct reduction at 550°C produced the best-performing catalyst (SR550).

These advancements address challenges in catalyst design and performance optimization by improving selectivity, stability, and activity. They also offer potential solutions to common issues like coke formation and catalyst deactivation. The direct reduction method, in particular, presents a simpler and potentially more cost-effective approach to catalyst fabrication for industrial applications.

最近提高直接脱氢过程中负载金属催化剂催化稳定性的策略包括：

1. 向Pt/Al2O3催化剂中添加Sn：这会削弱Pt-烯烃相互作用，抑制副反应，并提高丙烯选择性。Sn还能防止Pt烧结，降低载体酸性，并有助于去除积碳。

2. 直接还原法：这种方法在催化剂制备中跳过焙烧步骤，与传统焙烧催化剂相比，在丙烷转化率和丙烯选择性方面表现更佳。

3. 形成Pt3Sn合金：含有这些合金的催化剂显示出改善的PDH活性。

4. 氧氯化处理：这种方法在PDH反应后有效地再生PtSn/Al2O3催化剂。

5. 优化还原温度：研究发现，在550°C下直接还原产生了性能最佳的催化剂（SR550）。

这些进展通过提高选择性、稳定性和活性解决了催化剂设计和性能优化方面的挑战。它们还为常见问题如积碳形成和催化剂失活提供了潜在解决方案。特别是直接还原法为工业应用中的催化剂制造提供了一种更简单、可能更具成本效益的方法。
