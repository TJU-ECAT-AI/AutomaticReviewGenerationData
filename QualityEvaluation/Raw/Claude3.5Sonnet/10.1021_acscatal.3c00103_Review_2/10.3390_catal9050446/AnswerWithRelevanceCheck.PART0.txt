          [1] "When Sn is added to a Pt/Al2O3 catalyst, the Ptalkene interaction is weakened and side reactions are suppressed [13,14,15,16,17]. Thus, Sn may enhance the propylene selectivity of the PDH reaction [18,19]."

[2] "It has also been reported that Sn plays important roles in preventing Pt sintering, lowering the acidity of the oxide support, and removing the coke generated during the PDH process [4,20]."

[3] "Deng and coworkers [10,21,22] used a direct reduction method to prepare PDH catalysts, which did not include a calcination step, unlike the conventional protocol for catalyst preparation involving drying, calcination, and reduction."

[4] "The direct reduction method yielded a catalyst with much higher performance than the conventionally calcined catalyst considering propane conversion, as well as propylene selectivity."

[5] "We suspect that the interaction between propane and the PtSn alloys is greater for the Pt3Sn alloy than the PtSn alloy. Thus, the greater number of interactions enhances the PDH reaction and more coke is formed."

[6] "When coke accumulates, the metal sites become covered, which could inhibit the PDH reaction. If drain-off occurs, the active sites of catalysts are recovered."

[7] "Zhu et al. [9] reported a Sn-surface-enriched PtSn bimetallic nanoparticle catalyst prepared on a MgAl2O4 support using an organometallic chemistry concept, and the catalyst exhibited high selectivity and stability during the PDH reaction."

[8] "In our previous study [23], we reported that oxychlorination treatment was effective in regenerating PtSn/Al2O3 catalysts after the PDH reaction, and we observed that catalysts containing Pt3Sn alloys after oxychlorination treatment showed improved PDH activity."

[9] "As shown in Figure 2, the propylene selectivity values determined after 1 h were in the order of SR500 > SR550 > SR600 > Cal600 > SR450 > SR800 > SR900."

[10] "We can propose that the synergistic effect of the interaction of Pt and Sn covering the surface of Pt, as well as the accessible Pt sites, could improve the dehydrogenation performance of the catalyst prepared by the direct reduction method."

          Recent strategies and approaches to enhance the catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts in direct dehydrogenation processes include:

1. Addition of Sn to Pt/Al2O3 catalysts: This weakens Pt-alkene interactions, suppresses side reactions, and enhances propylene selectivity. Sn also helps prevent Pt sintering, lowers support acidity, and aids in coke removal.

2. Direct reduction method: This approach skips the calcination step in catalyst preparation, resulting in catalysts with higher performance in terms of propane conversion and propylene selectivity compared to conventional calcined catalysts.

3. Formation of specific alloys: The direct reduction method promotes the formation of Pt3Sn alloys, which are associated with improved catalytic activity. The stronger interaction between propane and Pt3Sn alloys enhances the dehydrogenation reaction.

4. Optimization of reduction temperature: Studies found that direct reduction at specific temperatures (e.g., 500-550°C) resulted in better catalyst performance.

5. Surface engineering: Creating a synergistic effect between Pt and Sn, where Sn covers the Pt surface while maintaining accessible Pt sites, improves dehydrogenation performance.

6. Coke management through "drain-off" effect: Understanding and utilizing the migration of coke from metal sites to the oxide support can help maintain catalyst activity over time.

7. Preparation of surface-enriched bimetallic nanoparticles: For example, Sn-surface-enriched PtSn bimetallic nanoparticle catalysts on MgAl2O4 support have shown high selectivity and stability.

8. Regeneration techniques: Oxychlorination treatment has been effective in regenerating PtSn/Al2O3 catalysts after the PDH reaction, with catalysts containing Pt3Sn alloys showing improved activity after treatment.

These advancements address challenges in catalyst design, fabrication, and performance optimization by improving selectivity, stability, and coke resistance. They offer methods to better control metal particle size, distribution, and alloy formation, enhancing catalyst efficiency and longevity for industrial applications.

          最近为提高直接脱氢过程中负载金属催化剂的催化稳定性而开发的关键策略和方法包括：

1. 向Pt/Al2O3催化剂中添加Sn：这可以减弱Pt-烯烃相互作用，抑制副反应，并提高丙烯选择性。Sn还有助于防止Pt烧结，降低载体酸度，并有助于去除积碳。

2. 直接还原法：这种方法省略了催化剂制备中的焙烧步骤，与传统焙烧的催化剂相比，能产生在丙烷转化率和丙烯选择性方面性能更高的催化剂。

3. 形成特定合金：直接还原法促进了Pt3Sn合金的形成，这种合金与改善的催化活性相关。丙烷与Pt3Sn合金之间更强的相互作用增强了脱氢反应。

4. 优化还原温度：研究发现，在特定温度下（如500-550°C）进行直接还原可以获得更好的催化剂性能。

5. 表面工程：在Sn覆盖Pt表面的同时保持可接触的Pt位点，创造Pt和Sn之间的协同效应，提高脱氢性能。

6. 通过"流失"效应管理焦炭：理解并利用焦炭从金属位点迁移到氧化物载体上的过程可以帮助长期维持催化剂活性。

7. 制备表面富集的双金属纳米粒子：例如，在MgAl2O4载体上制备的Sn表面富集的PtSn双金属纳米粒子催化剂显示出高选择性和稳定性。

8. 再生技术：氧氯化处理在PDH反应后有效地再生PtSn/Al2O3催化剂，含有Pt3Sn合金的催化剂在处理后显示出改善的活性。

这些进展通过提高选择性、稳定性和抗积碳能力解决了催化剂设计、制造和性能优化方面的挑战。它们提供了更好地控制金属粒子尺寸、分布和合金形成的方法，为工业应用提高了催化剂的效率和寿命。
