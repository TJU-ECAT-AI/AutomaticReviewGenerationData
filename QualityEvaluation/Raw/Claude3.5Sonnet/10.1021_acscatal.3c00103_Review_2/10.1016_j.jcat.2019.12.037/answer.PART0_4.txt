[1] "The CoSiBeta catalysts with or without prereduction treatments show similar catalytic performance but different induction periods, implying that the metallic Co formed in situ during the reaction are the active sites."

[2] "Noticeably, the very weak acidity may be responsible for its superior propylene selectivity by boosting the propylene desorption."

[3] "The recycling stability of the PDH reaction over the CoSiBeta catalyst is a prerequisite for practical application, and thus the reaction stability of 0.5CoSiBeta under forcing conditions was tested here."

[4] "After completion of the previous run, the catalysts were calcinated for 2 h in air at 600 C to remove the deposited coke for the next cycle without another reduction treatment."

[5] "The catalytic activities of the regenerated 0.5CoSiBeta are almost the same as that obtained with the fresh catalyst over four cycles, indicating that deactivation is caused mainly by carbon deposits instead of sintering of cobalt."

Recent strategies to enhance catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts for direct dehydrogenation include:

1. Using dealuminated zeolite supports like SiBeta to create silanols that can confine and stabilize metal species.

2. Optimizing metal loading to achieve highly dispersed active sites and prevent formation of large inactive particles.

3. Controlling reduction conditions to form small confined metallic particles that are highly active and selective.

4. Designing catalysts with very weak acidity to promote product desorption and improve selectivity.

5. Developing simple regeneration procedures like calcination in air to remove carbon deposits and restore activity.

These advancements address challenges by:

1. Improving metal-support interactions to enhance stability against sintering.

2. Optimizing active site structure and environment to achieve high activity and selectivity.

3. Enabling facile regeneration to maintain long-term performance.

4. Balancing metal loading and dispersion to maximize active site utilization.

5. Controlling acid-base properties to tune product selectivity.

Overall, these strategies aim to create more stable, active, and selective catalysts suitable for industrial dehydrogenation processes through careful control of catalyst composition, structure, and properties.
