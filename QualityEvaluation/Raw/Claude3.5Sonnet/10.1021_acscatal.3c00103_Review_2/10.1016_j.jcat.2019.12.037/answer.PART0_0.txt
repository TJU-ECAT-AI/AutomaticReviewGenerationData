[1] "Iglesia et al. found that alkane dehydrogenation over Co-ZSM-5 catalysts had reactivity similar to that over Ga-ZSM-5"

[2] "Recently Lis group gave new insight into the active phase of Co/Al2O3 catalyst in the PDH reaction. The Co/Al2O3 catalyst treated through a reductionreoxidization procedure showed high catalytic activity, indicating that small metallic Co particles were the active sites."

[3] "The dealumination of Beta zeolite developed by Dzwigaj et al. is a good way to further modify its structural and acidic properties, since the created T-vacant sites and low acidity are beneficial for many catalytic reactions"

[4] "CoOx within dealuminated Beta (SiBeta) zeolite developing into ultrasmall-sized Co particles under H2 or reactant gas is highly efficient for catalyzing direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) to propylene reaction."

[5] "After prereduction under optimum conditions, the 0.5CoSiBeta catalyst (Co loading is 0.5 wt%) showed propane conversion as high as 72% with propylene selectivity of around 92%."

Recent strategies to enhance catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts for direct dehydrogenation include:

1. Using dealuminated zeolites as supports: Dealumination creates T-vacant sites and low acidity, which are beneficial for catalytic reactions. This approach was used to develop CoSiBeta catalysts.

2. Confining metal species in zeolite frameworks: CoOx confined in dealuminated Beta zeolite developed into ultrasmall Co particles, which were highly efficient for propane dehydrogenation.

3. Optimizing metal loading: Low metal loading (e.g. 0.5 wt% Co) on SiBeta showed high conversion and selectivity.

4. Reduction-reoxidation treatments: This procedure was found to create small metallic Co particles that were active sites for the reaction.

5. In-situ reduction: CoOx species could be reduced to active metallic Co particles during the reaction itself.

These advancements address challenges in catalyst design by improving metal dispersion, enhancing metal-support interactions, and creating more stable active sites. They optimize performance by achieving high conversion and selectivity simultaneously, and improve stability by preventing metal sintering and coke formation. For industrial applications, these approaches offer more efficient use of metals, longer catalyst lifetimes, and potentially lower costs compared to traditional precious metal catalysts.

近期提高直接脱氢反应中负载金属催化剂稳定性的策略包括：

1. 使用脱铝沸石作为载体：脱铝创造了T位空位和低酸性，有利于催化反应。这种方法被用于开发CoSiBeta催化剂。

2. 将金属物种限制在沸石骨架中：限制在脱铝Beta沸石中的CoOx发展成超小Co颗粒，对丙烷脱氢高效。

3. 优化金属负载量：在SiBeta上低金属负载量（如0.5 wt% Co）显示出高转化率和选择性。

4. 还原-再氧化处理：这一程序被发现可以创造小的金属Co颗粒，作为反应的活性位点。

5. 原位还原：CoOx物种可以在反应过程中被还原为活性金属Co颗粒。

这些进展通过改善金属分散性、增强金属-载体相互作用和创造更稳定的活性位点，解决了催化剂设计中的挑战。它们通过同时实现高转化率和选择性来优化性能，并通过防止金属烧结和积碳来提高稳定性。对于工业应用，这些方法与传统贵金属催化剂相比，提供了更高效的金属利用、更长的催化剂寿命和潜在的更低成本。
