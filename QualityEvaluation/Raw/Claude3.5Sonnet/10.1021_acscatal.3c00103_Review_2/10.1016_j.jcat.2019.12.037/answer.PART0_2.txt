[1] "Sulfate addition could lead to improved catalytic performance by dispersing cobalt species well and restraining the reduction to metallic Co"

[2] "The 0.5CoSiBeta catalyst shows considerable catalytic activity with very high propylene selectivity, and the induction period is evidently shortened after reduction treatment."

[3] "After completion of the previous run, the catalysts were calcinated for 2 h in air at 600 C to remove the deposited coke for the next cycle without another reduction treatment."

[4] "The catalytic activities of the regenerated 0.5CoSiBeta are almost the same as that obtained with the fresh catalyst over four cycles, indicating that deactivation is caused mainly by carbon deposits instead of sintering of cobalt."

The literature discusses several strategies to enhance the catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts in direct dehydrogenation processes:

1. Sulfate addition: This approach improves catalytic performance by better dispersing cobalt species and inhibiting their reduction to metallic form.

2. Reduction treatment: Pre-reducing the catalyst shortens the induction period and improves initial activity.

3. Regeneration through calcination: Calcinating the used catalyst in air at 600°C for 2 hours effectively removes carbon deposits and restores activity.

4. Proper support selection: Using dealuminated beta zeolite (SiBeta) as a support helps confine cobalt species and maintain high dispersion.

These advancements address challenges in catalyst design and performance optimization by:

- Improving metal dispersion and stability
- Reducing deactivation caused by coking
- Enabling easy regeneration without loss of activity
- Optimizing the metal-support interaction for better performance and longevity

The ability to maintain high activity over multiple cycles through simple regeneration is particularly promising for industrial applications, as it can significantly extend catalyst lifetime and reduce operational costs.

文献讨论了几种提高直接脱氢过程中负载金属催化剂稳定性的策略：

1. 硫酸盐添加：这种方法通过更好地分散钴物种并抑制其还原为金属态来提高催化性能。

2. 还原处理：预先还原催化剂可缩短诱导期并提高初始活性。

3. 通过焙烧再生：在600°C下用空气焙烧使用过的催化剂2小时可有效去除碳沉积并恢复活性。

4. 适当选择载体：使用脱铝的Beta沸石（SiBeta）作为载体有助于限制钴物种并保持高度分散。

这些进展通过以下方式解决了催化剂设计和性能优化方面的挑战：

- 改善金属分散性和稳定性
- 减少由结焦引起的失活
- 实现简单再生而不损失活性
- 优化金属-载体相互作用以获得更好的性能和寿命

通过简单再生就能在多个循环中保持高活性的能力对工业应用特别有前景，因为它可以显著延长催化剂寿命并降低运营成本。
