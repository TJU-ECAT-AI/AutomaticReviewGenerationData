[1] "Iglesia et al. found that alkane dehydrogenation over Co-ZSM-5 catalysts had reactivity similar to that over Ga-ZSM-5"

[2] "Recently Lis group gave new insight into the active phase of Co/Al2O3 catalyst in the PDH reaction. The Co/Al2O3 catalyst treated through a reductionreoxidization procedure showed high catalytic activity, indicating that small metallic Co particles were the active sites."

[3] "The dealumination of Beta zeolite developed by Dzwigaj et al. is a good way to further modify its structural and acidic properties, since the created T-vacant sites and low acidity are beneficial for many catalytic reactions"

[4] "CoOx within dealuminated Beta (SiBeta) zeolite developing into ultrasmall-sized Co particles under H2 or reactant gas is highly efficient for catalyzing direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) to propylene reaction."

Recent strategies to enhance catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts for direct dehydrogenation include:

1. Using dealuminated zeolites as supports: Dealumination creates T-vacant sites and low acidity, which are beneficial for catalytic reactions. This approach was used to develop CoSiBeta catalysts.

2. Confining metal species in zeolite frameworks: CoOx confined in dealuminated Beta zeolite developed into ultrasmall Co particles, which were highly efficient for propane dehydrogenation.

3. Optimizing metal loading: Low metal loading (e.g. 0.5 wt% Co) on SiBeta showed high conversion and selectivity.

4. Reduction-reoxidation treatments: This procedure was found to create small metallic Co particles that were active sites for the reaction.

5. In-situ reduction: CoOx species could be reduced to active metallic Co particles during the reaction itself.

These advancements address challenges in catalyst design by improving metal dispersion, enhancing metal-support interactions, and creating more stable active sites. They optimize performance by achieving high conversion and selectivity simultaneously, and improve stability by preventing metal sintering and coke formation. For industrial applications, these approaches offer more efficient use of metals, longer catalyst lifetimes, and potentially lower costs compared to traditional precious metal catalysts.

[1] "Alternatively, several transition metals, void of shortcomings typical of CrOx and Pt catalysts, have been investigated for the PDH reaction"

[2] "The CoSiBeta catalysts with or without prereduction treatments show similar catalytic performance but different induction periods, implying that the metallic Co formed in situ during the reaction are the active sites."

[3] "The 0.5CoSiBeta catalyst shows considerable catalytic activity with very high propylene selectivity, and the induction period is evidently shortened after reduction treatment."

[4] "After completion of the previous run, the catalysts were calcinated for 2 h in air at 600 C to remove the deposited coke for the next cycle without another reduction treatment. The catalytic activities of the regenerated 0.5CoSiBeta are almost the same as that obtained with the fresh catalyst over four cycles, indicating that deactivation is caused mainly by carbon deposits instead of sintering of cobalt."

The literature discusses several strategies to enhance the catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts in direct dehydrogenation processes:

1. Sulfate addition: This approach improves catalytic performance by better dispersing cobalt species and inhibiting their reduction to metallic form.

2. Reduction treatment: Pre-reducing the catalyst shortens the induction period and improves initial activity.

3. Regeneration through calcination: Calcinating the used catalyst in air at 600°C for 2 hours effectively removes carbon deposits and restores activity.

4. Proper support selection: Using dealuminated beta zeolite (SiBeta) as a support helps confine cobalt species and maintain high dispersion.

These advancements address challenges in catalyst design and performance optimization by:

- Improving metal dispersion and stability

- Enabling easy regeneration without loss of activity
- Optimizing the metal-support interaction for better performance and longevity

The ability to maintain high activity over multiple cycles through simple regeneration is particularly promising for industrial applications, as it can significantly extend catalyst lifetime and reduce operational costs.
