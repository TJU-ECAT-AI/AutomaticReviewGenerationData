[1] "CoOx within dealuminated Beta (SiBeta) zeolite developing into ultrasmall-sized Co particles under H2 or reactant gas is highly efficient for catalyzing direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) to propylene reaction."

[2] "The dealumination of Beta zeolite developed by Dzwigaj et al. is a good way to further modify its structural and acidic properties, since the created T-vacant sites and low acidity are beneficial for many catalytic reactions"

[3] "The CoSiBeta catalysts with or without prereduction treatments show similar catalytic performance but different induction periods, implying that the metallic Co formed in situ during the reaction are the active sites."

[4] "After completion of the previous run, the catalysts were calcinated for 2 h in air at 600 C to remove the deposited coke for the next cycle without another reduction treatment. The catalytic activities of the regenerated 0.5CoSiBeta are almost the same as that obtained with the fresh catalyst over four cycles, indicating that deactivation is caused mainly by carbon deposits instead of sintering of cobalt."

Recent key strategies to enhance catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts for direct dehydrogenation include:

1. Using dealuminated zeolites as supports: Dealuminated Beta zeolite (SiBeta) creates vacant T-sites and low acidity, which are beneficial for confining metal species and improving catalytic performance.

2. Developing ultrasmall metal particles: CoOx confined in SiBeta develops into ultrasmall Co particles under reaction conditions, which are highly efficient for propane dehydrogenation.

3. In-situ formation of active sites: Metallic Co formed during the reaction serves as the active sites, eliminating the need for pre-reduction and improving stability.

4. Optimizing metal loading: Low Co loading (0.5 wt%) on SiBeta shows excellent performance and stability.

5. Simple regeneration process: Calcination in air at 600°C for 2 hours effectively removes coke deposits and restores catalytic activity over multiple cycles.

These advancements address challenges in catalyst design by improving metal dispersion, creating confined active sites, enhancing coke resistance, and enabling easy regeneration. This approach optimizes catalyst performance and stability for potential industrial applications in direct dehydrogenation processes.

最近提高直接脱氢反应中负载金属催化剂催化稳定性的关键策略包括：

1. 使用脱铝沸石作为载体：脱铝Beta沸石（SiBeta）创造了空缺的T位点和低酸度，有利于限制金属物种并提高催化性能。

2. 开发超小金属颗粒：限制在SiBeta中的CoOx在反应条件下发展成超小Co颗粒，对丙烷脱氢高度有效。

3. 原位形成活性位点：反应过程中形成的金属Co作为活性位点，消除了预还原的需求并提高了稳定性。

4. 优化金属负载量：在SiBeta上低Co负载量（0.5 wt%）显示出优异的性能和稳定性。

5. 简单的再生过程：在600°C下空气中煅烧2小时可有效去除积碳沉积物，并在多个循环中恢复催化活性。

这些进展通过改善金属分散、创造受限活性位点、增强抗积碳能力和实现简易再生，解决了催化剂设计中的挑战。这种方法优化了催化剂性能和稳定性，为直接脱氢过程的潜在工业应用提供了可能。
