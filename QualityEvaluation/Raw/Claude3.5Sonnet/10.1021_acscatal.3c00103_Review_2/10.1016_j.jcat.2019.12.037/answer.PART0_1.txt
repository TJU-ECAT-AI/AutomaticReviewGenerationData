[1] "Alternatively, several transition metals, void of shortcomings typical of CrOx and Pt catalysts, have been investigated for the PDH reaction"

[2] "The CoSiBeta catalysts with or without prereduction treatments show similar catalytic performance but different induction periods, implying that the metallic Co formed in situ during the reaction are the active sites."

[3] "The 0.5CoSiBeta catalyst shows considerable catalytic activity with very high propylene selectivity, and the induction period is evidently shortened after reduction treatment."

[4] "After completion of the previous run, the catalysts were calcinated for 2 h in air at 600 C to remove the deposited coke for the next cycle without another reduction treatment. The catalytic activities of the regenerated 0.5CoSiBeta are almost the same as that obtained with the fresh catalyst over four cycles, indicating that deactivation is caused mainly by carbon deposits instead of sintering of cobalt."

Recent strategies to enhance catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts for direct dehydrogenation include:

1. Using transition metals like cobalt instead of traditional CrOx and Pt catalysts to avoid their shortcomings.

2. Developing catalysts that form active metallic sites in-situ during the reaction, as demonstrated by CoSiBeta catalysts.

3. Employing pre-reduction treatments to shorten induction periods and improve initial activity.

4. Designing catalysts that can be easily regenerated by calcination to remove carbon deposits, allowing multiple reaction cycles without significant loss of activity.

5. Confining metal species within zeolite structures to create small, stable active sites.

These advancements address challenges in catalyst design by improving stability, selectivity, and regenerability while using more abundant, cost-effective metals. They optimize performance for industrial applications by maintaining high activity over multiple cycles and allowing easier regeneration.

最近用于增强直接脱氢过程中负载金属催化剂稳定性的策略包括：

1. 使用钴等过渡金属代替传统的CrOx和Pt催化剂，以避免它们的缺点。

2. 开发在反应过程中原位形成活性金属位点的催化剂，如CoSiBeta催化剂所示。

3. 采用预还原处理来缩短诱导期并提高初始活性。

4. 设计可通过煅烧轻松再生以去除碳沉积物的催化剂，允许多次反应循环而活性无明显损失。

5. 将金属物种限制在沸石结构内，以创造小而稳定的活性位点。

这些进展通过使用更丰富、更具成本效益的金属来提高稳定性、选择性和再生能力，从而解决了催化剂设计中的挑战。它们通过在多个循环中保持高活性并允许更容易再生来优化工业应用的性能。
