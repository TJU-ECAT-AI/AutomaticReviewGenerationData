          [1] "CoOx within dealuminated Beta (SiBeta) zeolite developing into ultrasmall-sized Co particles under H2 or reactant gas is highly efficient for catalyzing direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) to propylene reaction."

[2] "The dealumination of Beta zeolite developed by Dzwigaj et al. is a good way to further modify its structural and acidic properties, since the created T-vacant sites and low acidity are beneficial for many catalytic reactions"

[3] "After prereduction under optimum conditions, the 0.5CoSiBeta catalyst (Co loading is 0.5 wt%) showed propane conversion as high as 72% with propylene selectivity of around 92%."

[4] "The CoSiBeta catalysts with or without prereduction treatments show similar catalytic performance but different induction periods, implying that the metallic Co formed in situ during the reaction are the active sites."

[5] "After completion of the previous run, the catalysts were calcinated for 2 h in air at 600 C to remove the deposited coke for the next cycle without another reduction treatment. The catalytic activities of the regenerated 0.5CoSiBeta are almost the same as that obtained with the fresh catalyst over four cycles, indicating that deactivation is caused mainly by carbon deposits instead of sintering of cobalt."

[6] "Sulfate addition could lead to improved catalytic performance by dispersing cobalt species well and restraining the reduction to metallic Co"

[7] "Noticeably, the very weak acidity may be responsible for its superior propylene selectivity by boosting the propylene desorption."

          Recent key strategies and approaches to enhance the catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts in direct dehydrogenation processes include:

1. Using dealuminated zeolites as supports: Dealumination of Beta zeolite (SiBeta) creates T-vacant sites and low acidity, which are beneficial for confining metal species and improving catalytic performance.

2. Developing ultrasmall metal particles: CoOx confined in SiBeta develops into ultrasmall Co particles under reaction conditions, which are highly efficient for propane dehydrogenation.

3. Optimizing metal loading: Low Co loading (e.g., 0.5 wt%) on SiBeta shows excellent performance and stability, with high propane conversion and propylene selectivity.

4. In-situ formation of active sites: Metallic Co formed during the reaction serves as the active sites, eliminating the need for pre-reduction and improving stability.

5. Simple regeneration process: Calcination in air at 600°C for 2 hours effectively removes coke deposits and restores catalytic activity over multiple cycles.

6. Sulfate addition: This approach improves catalytic performance by better dispersing cobalt species and inhibiting their reduction to metallic form.

7. Controlling acidity: Very weak acidity may contribute to superior propylene selectivity by promoting propylene desorption.

These advancements address challenges in catalyst design, fabrication, and performance optimization for industrial applications by:

- Improving metal dispersion and stability
- Creating confined active sites
- Enhancing coke resistance
- Enabling easy regeneration
- Optimizing metal-support interactions
- Balancing metal loading and dispersion to maximize active site utilization
- Controlling acid-base properties to tune product selectivity

Overall, these strategies aim to create more stable, active, and selective catalysts suitable for industrial dehydrogenation processes through careful control of catalyst composition, structure, and properties.

          最近提高直接脱氢过程中负载金属催化剂催化稳定性的关键策略和方法包括：

1. 使用脱铝沸石作为载体：Beta沸石（SiBeta）的脱铝创造了T位空位和低酸性，有利于限制金属物种并提高催化性能。

2. 开发超小金属颗粒：限制在SiBeta中的CoOx在反应条件下发展成超小Co颗粒，对丙烷脱氢高度有效。

3. 优化金属负载量：在SiBeta上低Co负载量（如0.5 wt%）显示出优异的性能和稳定性，具有高丙烷转化率和丙烯选择性。

4. 原位形成活性位点：反应过程中形成的金属Co作为活性位点，消除了预还原的需求并提高了稳定性。

5. 简单的再生过程：在600°C下空气中煅烧2小时可有效去除积碳沉积物，并在多个循环中恢复催化活性。

6. 硫酸盐添加：这种方法通过更好地分散钴物种并抑制其还原为金属态来提高催化性能。

7. 控制酸度：非常弱的酸性可能通过促进丙烯脱附来贡献于优异的丙烯选择性。

这些进展通过以下方式解决了催化剂设计、制造和性能优化中的挑战，以适应工业应用：

- 改善金属分散性和稳定性
- 创造受限活性位点
- 增强抗积碳能力
- 实现简易再生
- 优化金属-载体相互作用
