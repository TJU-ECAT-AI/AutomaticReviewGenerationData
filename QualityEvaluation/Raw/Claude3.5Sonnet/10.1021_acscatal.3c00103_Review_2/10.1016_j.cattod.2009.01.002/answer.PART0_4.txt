[1] "Pt-Sn bimetallic catalysts show the above mentioned characteristics to some extent more than the corresponding monometallic Pt catalysts"

[2] "Sn results in higher Pt dispersion by alloy formation in Pt-Sn-SBA-15-IW. This leads to the formation of smaller Pt particles in Pt-Sn-SBA-15-IW than in Pt-SBA-15-IW as evidenced by TEM, XRD and H2-chemisorption."

[3] "Pt-Sn-SBA-15-IW exhibits higher selectivity to propylene and superior catalyst stability than that of Pt-SBA-15-IW due to weaker adsorption affinity of hydrocarbons on the surface Pt sites in Pt-Sn bimetallic particles. Thus, it creates a draining-off effect that keeps active sites clean from coking."

[4] "Sn might have preferentially located at highly coordinatively unsaturated surface Pt sites of bimetallic alloy Pt-Sn particles, as reported previously"

The key strategies and approaches recently developed to enhance the catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts in direct dehydrogenation processes include:

1. Using bimetallic catalysts: The addition of a second metal, such as Sn to Pt, has been shown to improve catalyst performance and stability compared to monometallic catalysts.

2. Increasing metal dispersion: Bimetallic catalysts like Pt-Sn result in higher dispersion of the active metal (Pt), leading to smaller metal particles and improved catalytic properties.

3. Modifying electronic properties: The interaction between the two metals in bimetallic catalysts modifies the electronic properties of the active sites, leading to weaker adsorption of hydrocarbons and improved selectivity.

4. Employing the drain-off effect: In bimetallic catalysts, the second metal (e.g., Sn) acts as a scavenger to keep active sites clean from coke by draining off coke precursors to the support.

5. Targeting specific surface sites: The second metal preferentially locates at highly coordinatively unsaturated surface sites of the primary metal, modifying their catalytic properties.

These advancements address challenges in catalyst design by improving metal dispersion, enhancing selectivity, and reducing coking. They optimize performance for industrial applications by increasing catalyst stability and longevity, which are crucial for continuous operation in industrial settings.

最近开发的提高直接脱氢过程中负载金属催化剂催化稳定性的关键策略和方法包括：

1. 使用双金属催化剂：添加第二种金属（如将Sn添加到Pt中）已被证明可以提高催化剂的性能和稳定性，相比于单金属催化剂。

2. 增加金属分散度：像Pt-Sn这样的双金属催化剂可以提高活性金属（Pt）的分散度，形成更小的金属颗粒，从而改善催化性能。

3. 修改电子性质：双金属催化剂中两种金属之间的相互作用改变了活性位点的电子性质，导致碳氢化合物吸附能力减弱，选择性提高。

4. 利用排出效应：在双金属催化剂中，第二种金属（如Sn）作为清除剂，将焦炭前体物排到载体上，保持活性位点清洁。

5. 针对特定表面位点：第二种金属优先定位于主要金属的高度不饱和配位表面位点，改变其催化性质。

这些进展通过改善金属分散度、提高选择性和减少结焦来解决催化剂设计中的挑战。它们通过增加催化剂的稳定性和寿命来优化工业应用的性能，这对于工业环境中的连续运行至关重要。
