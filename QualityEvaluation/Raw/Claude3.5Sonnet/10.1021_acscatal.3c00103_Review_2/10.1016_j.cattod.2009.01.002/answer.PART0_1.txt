[1] "Pt-Sn bimetallic catalysts show the above mentioned characteristics to some extent more than the corresponding monometallic Pt catalysts"

[2] "Pt-Sn-SBA-15-IW exhibits higher selectivity to propylene and superior catalyst stability than that of Pt-SBA-15-IW due to weaker adsorption affinity of hydrocarbons on the surface Pt sites in Pt-Sn bimetallic particles."

[3] "Sn results in higher Pt dispersion by alloy formation in Pt-Sn-SBA-15-IW. This leads to the formation of smaller Pt particles in Pt-Sn-SBA-15-IW than in Pt-SBA-15-IW as evidenced by TEM, XRD and H2-chemisorption."

[4] "Sn might have preferentially located at highly coordinatively unsaturated surface Pt sites of bimetallic alloy Pt-Sn particles, as reported previously"

[5] "Sn acts as a scavenger to keep Pt sites clean from coke by draining-off the coke precursors from the vicinity of active sites to the support, which acts as a reservoir for coke deposits."

Recent strategies to enhance catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts in direct dehydrogenation processes include:

1. Using bimetallic catalysts: Pt-Sn bimetallic catalysts show improved characteristics compared to monometallic Pt catalysts, including higher selectivity and stability.

2. Improving metal dispersion: Adding Sn to Pt catalysts results in higher Pt dispersion through alloy formation, leading to smaller Pt particles.

3. Modifying surface properties: Sn preferentially locates at highly coordinatively unsaturated Pt sites, modifying the electronic properties and catalytic behavior of Pt.

4. Employing the drain-off effect: Sn acts as a scavenger, keeping Pt sites clean by draining coke precursors away from active sites to the support.

5. Optimizing support materials: Using mesoporous supports like SBA-15 can provide a large surface area and act as a reservoir for coke deposits.

These advancements address challenges in catalyst design by improving selectivity, stability, and coke resistance. They optimize performance for industrial applications by maintaining catalyst activity over longer periods and reducing the frequency of regeneration cycles.

最近用于提高直接脱氢过程中负载金属催化剂催化稳定性的策略包括：

1. 使用双金属催化剂：与单金属Pt催化剂相比，Pt-Sn双金属催化剂表现出更好的特性，包括更高的选择性和稳定性。

2. 改善金属分散度：向Pt催化剂中添加Sn可通过合金形成提高Pt的分散度，从而形成更小的Pt颗粒。

3. 修改表面性质：Sn优先位于高度不饱和配位的Pt位点，改变Pt的电子性质和催化行为。

4. 利用排出效应：Sn作为清除剂，通过将焦炭前体从活性位点排到载体上，保持Pt位点的清洁。

5. 优化载体材料：使用如SBA-15等介孔载体可提供大的表面积，并作为焦炭沉积的储存库。

这些进展通过提高选择性、稳定性和抗焦炭能力解决了催化剂设计中的挑战。它们通过延长催化剂活性维持时间和减少再生周期频率，优化了工业应用性能。
