[1] "Pt-Sn bimetallic catalysts show the above mentioned characteristics to some extent more than the corresponding monometallic Pt catalysts"

[2] "Pt-Sn-SBA-15-IW exhibits higher selectivity to propylene and superior catalyst stability than that of Pt-SBA-15-IW due to weaker adsorption affinity of hydrocarbons on the surface Pt sites in Pt-Sn bimetallic particles. Thus, it creates a draining-off effect that keeps active sites clean from coking."

[3] "Sn results in higher Pt dispersion by alloy formation in Pt-Sn-SBA-15-IW. This leads to the formation of smaller Pt particles in Pt-Sn-SBA-15-IW than in Pt-SBA-15-IW as evidenced by TEM, XRD and H2-chemisorption."

[4] "The nature and activity properties of surface Pt sites in the catalysts are different due to differences in surface roughness (i.e., surface site heterogeneity) of the particles. Additionally, catalytic properties of Pt sites are influenced by modification of electronic properties of the same sites by Sn in bimetallic PtSn alloy particles (Pt-Sn-SBA-15-IW)."

Recent strategies to enhance catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts in direct dehydrogenation processes include:

1. Use of bimetallic catalysts: Pt-Sn bimetallic catalysts show improved characteristics compared to monometallic Pt catalysts, including higher selectivity and stability.

2. Controlling metal dispersion and particle size: Adding Sn results in higher Pt dispersion and smaller Pt particles, which affects catalyst performance.

3. Modifying electronic properties: The addition of Sn modifies the electronic properties of Pt sites in bimetallic particles, influencing catalytic behavior.

4. Exploiting surface roughness effects: Differences in surface roughness of catalyst particles impact the nature and activity of surface metal sites.

5. Implementing a "draining-off" effect: Weaker adsorption affinity of hydrocarbons on Pt-Sn bimetallic particles creates a draining-off effect that keeps active sites clean from coking, improving stability.

These advancements address challenges in catalyst design by optimizing metal dispersion, modifying electronic properties, and enhancing resistance to coking. They improve catalyst fabrication by guiding the synthesis of bimetallic particles with controlled size and composition. For industrial applications, these strategies offer pathways to develop more stable and selective catalysts for direct dehydrogenation processes.

最近为提高直接脱氢过程中负载金属催化剂的催化稳定性而开发的策略包括：

1. 使用双金属催化剂：Pt-Sn双金属催化剂相比单金属Pt催化剂表现出更好的特性，包括更高的选择性和稳定性。

2. 控制金属分散度和粒子尺寸：添加Sn可以提高Pt的分散度并形成更小的Pt粒子，这会影响催化剂的性能。

3. 修改电子性质：添加Sn修改了双金属粒子中Pt位点的电子性质，从而影响催化行为。

4. 利用表面粗糙度效应：催化剂粒子表面粗糙度的差异影响表面金属位点的性质和活性。

5. 实施"排出"效应：碳氢化合物在Pt-Sn双金属粒子上的吸附亲和力较弱，产生排出效应，保持活性位点免于积碳，提高稳定性。

这些进展通过优化金属分散度、修改电子性质和增强抗积碳能力来解决催化剂设计中的挑战。它们通过指导合成具有可控尺寸和成分的双金属粒子来改进催化剂制备。对于工业应用，这些策略为开发更稳定、更具选择性的直接脱氢过程催化剂提供了途径。
