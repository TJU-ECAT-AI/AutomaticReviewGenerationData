[1] "Pt-Sn bimetallic catalysts show the above mentioned characteristics to some extent more than the corresponding monometallic Pt catalysts"

[2] "Pt-Sn-SBA-15-IW exhibits higher selectivity to propylene and superior catalyst stability than that of Pt-SBA-15-IW due to weaker adsorption affinity of hydrocarbons on the surface Pt sites in Pt-Sn bimetallic particles."

[3] "Sn results in higher Pt dispersion by alloy formation in Pt-Sn-SBA-15-IW. This leads to the formation of smaller Pt particles in Pt-Sn-SBA-15-IW than in Pt-SBA-15-IW as evidenced by TEM, XRD and H2-chemisorption."

[4] "Sn might have preferentially located at highly coordinatively unsaturated surface Pt sites of bimetallic alloy Pt-Sn particles, as reported previously"

Recent strategies to enhance catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts in direct dehydrogenation processes include:

1. Using bimetallic catalysts, particularly Pt-Sn, which show improved characteristics compared to monometallic Pt catalysts.

2. Increasing metal dispersion through alloy formation, leading to smaller metal particles. This is achieved in Pt-Sn-SBA-15 catalysts.

3. Modifying the electronic properties of active metal sites. In Pt-Sn catalysts, Sn preferentially locates at highly coordinatively unsaturated Pt sites, altering their properties.

4. Weakening the adsorption affinity of hydrocarbons on metal sites. This is observed in Pt-Sn bimetallic particles, leading to higher selectivity and stability.

These advancements address challenges in catalyst design by improving metal dispersion, modifying surface properties, and optimizing interactions between the catalyst and reactants. They enhance selectivity and stability, which are crucial for industrial applications. The use of bimetallic systems and control over particle size and electronic properties represent key areas of focus in optimizing catalyst performance for dehydrogenation processes.

最近提高直接脱氢过程中负载金属催化剂稳定性的策略包括：

1. 使用双金属催化剂，特别是Pt-Sn，其特性优于单金属Pt催化剂。

2. 通过合金形成增加金属分散度，形成更小的金属颗粒。这在Pt-Sn-SBA-15催化剂中得以实现。

3. 修改活性金属位点的电子性质。在Pt-Sn催化剂中，Sn优先定位于高度配位不饱和的Pt位点，改变其性质。

4. 减弱碳氢化合物在金属位点上的吸附亲和力。这在Pt-Sn双金属颗粒中观察到，导致更高的选择性和稳定性。

这些进展通过改善金属分散度、修改表面性质和优化催化剂与反应物之间的相互作用来解决催化剂设计中的挑战。它们提高了选择性和稳定性，这对工业应用至关重要。双金属系统的使用以及对粒子大小和电子性质的控制代表了优化脱氢过程催化剂性能的关键研究领域。
