[1] "Pt-Sn bimetallic catalysts show the above mentioned characteristics to some extent more than the corresponding monometallic Pt catalysts"

[2] "Pt-Sn-SBA-15-IW shows higher activity and much superior selectivity to propylene than that by Pt-SBA-15-IW"

[3] "Despite higher amount of coke formation on Pt-Sn-SBA-15-IW, it still exhibits much higher selectivity to propylene and catalyst stability than its counter part Pt-SBA-15-IW"

[4] "Sn acts as a scavenger to keep Pt sites clean from coke by draining-off the coke precursors from the vicinity of active sites to the support, which acts as a reservoir for coke deposits."

[5] "Pt-Sn-SBA-15-IW exhibits higher selectivity to propylene and superior catalyst stability than that of Pt-SBA-15-IW due to weaker adsorption affinity of hydrocarbons on the surface Pt sites in Pt-Sn bimetallic particles."

Recent strategies to enhance catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts in direct dehydrogenation processes include:

1. Using bimetallic catalysts, particularly Pt-Sn, instead of monometallic Pt catalysts. Pt-Sn catalysts show improved activity, selectivity, and stability compared to Pt alone.

2. Optimizing metal particle size and dispersion. Smaller Pt-Sn particles formed by alloying lead to higher activity and selectivity.

3. Modifying the electronic properties of active metal sites. The addition of Sn alters the electronic configuration of Pt, weakening hydrocarbon adsorption and favoring selective dehydrogenation over coking.

4. Employing a "drain-off" effect. Sn acts as a scavenger, allowing coke precursors to migrate away from active sites to the support, preserving catalyst activity.

5. Careful selection of support materials. Mesoporous supports like SBA-15 provide high surface area and can act as reservoirs for coke deposits.

These advancements address challenges in catalyst design by tuning metal-support interactions, optimizing active site properties, and managing coke formation to prolong catalyst lifetime for industrial applications.

最近为提高直接脱氢过程中负载金属催化剂的催化稳定性而开发的策略包括：

1. 使用双金属催化剂，特别是Pt-Sn，而不是单金属Pt催化剂。与单独使用Pt相比，Pt-Sn催化剂显示出更好的活性、选择性和稳定性。

2. 优化金属粒子大小和分散度。通过合金化形成的较小Pt-Sn粒子导致更高的活性和选择性。

3. 修改活性金属位点的电子性质。添加Sn改变了Pt的电子构型，减弱了碳氢化合物的吸附，有利于选择性脱氢而不是结焦。

4. 采用"排出"效应。Sn作为清除剂，允许焦炭前体从活性位点迁移到载体上，从而保持催化剂活性。

5. 仔细选择载体材料。像SBA-15这样的介孔载体提供了高比表面积，可以作为焦炭沉积的储存库。

这些进展通过调节金属-载体相互作用、优化活性位点性质和管理焦炭形成来解决催化剂设计中的挑战，从而延长工业应用中催化剂的使用寿命。
