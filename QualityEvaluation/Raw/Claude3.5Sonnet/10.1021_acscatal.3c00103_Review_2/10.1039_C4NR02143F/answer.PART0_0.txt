[1] "The addition of promoters such as Sn,2,7,12,14 La,11,15 Ga16 and Zn17 species has been reported to be effective."

[2] "Veldurthi et al.19 investigated copper-modified Pt/Al2O3 and Pd/Al2O3 catalysts for n-butane dehydrogenation, which showed enhanced n-butane conversion, catalyst stability, as well as C4 olefin selectivity."

[3] "The Cu addition causes a decrease of metal dispersion to 65.3%. Consistent with the results of H2 uptakes shown in Table 1, Cu was reported to have a lower H2 adsorption ability owing to its filled 3d electrical orbital,24 resulting in a weak electrical interaction with hydrogen atoms."

[4] "The Cu addition alters the electronic environment of surface Pt atoms and weakens the interaction between Pt and adsorbed molecules, resulting in the final downward shift of the CO adsorption band."

[5] "The Cu promoter plays a significant role in the reaction of PDH by inducing the metal interaction between Pt and Cu, which is the primary origin of the enhanced propylene selectivity and anti-coking ability of the PtCu/Al2O3 catalyst."

Recent strategies to enhance catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts in direct dehydrogenation processes include:

1. Addition of promoters: Elements like Sn, La, Ga, and Zn have been found to improve catalyst performance.

2. Bimetallic catalysts: Copper modification of Pt/Al2O3 and Pd/Al2O3 catalysts has shown enhanced conversion, stability, and olefin selectivity.

3. Electronic environment modification: Cu addition alters the electronic structure of Pt surface atoms, weakening interactions with adsorbed molecules.

4. Metal-metal interactions: The PtCu interaction in bimetallic catalysts is key to improving propylene selectivity and anti-coking ability.

5. Dispersion control: While Cu addition decreases metal dispersion, it also modifies hydrogen adsorption properties.

These advancements address challenges in catalyst design by:

- Improving selectivity towards desired products
- Enhancing catalyst stability and lifetime
- Reducing coke formation and catalyst deactivation
- Modifying adsorption properties of reactants and products
- Optimizing electronic properties of active metal sites

For industrial applications, these strategies offer potential for developing more efficient and stable catalysts for dehydrogenation processes, potentially leading to improved yields, reduced downtime, and lower operational costs.
