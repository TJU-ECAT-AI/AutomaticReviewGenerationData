[1] "Extensive investigations have been performed to improve the catalytic performance and stability of Pt-based catalysts for PDH. The addition of promoters such as Sn, La, Ga and Zn species has been reported to be effective."

[2] "PtCu/Al2O3 was examined by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and infrared spectroscopy of CO and propylene adsorption (CO-IR and C3H6-IR) to understand the interaction between Cu addition and the active sites of Pt."

[3] "The Cu addition results in an enhancement in propylene selectivity and catalyst stability, where PtCu0.5/Al2O3 exhibits the highest propylene selectivity with the lowest deactivation rate."

[4] "The Cu promoter plays a significant role in the reaction of PDH by inducing the metal interaction between Pt and Cu, which is the primary origin of the enhanced propylene selectivity and anti-coking ability of the PtCu/Al2O3 catalyst."

[5] "The facile desorption of propylene from the PtCu/Al2O3 catalyst guarantees the high propylene selectivity by diminishing the possibility of polymerization reactions for coke formation and other undesired side reactions such as thermal cracking reactions forming lighter hydrocarbons."

Recent strategies to enhance catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts in direct dehydrogenation processes include:

1. Addition of promoters: Incorporating elements like Sn, La, Ga, and Zn has been shown to improve catalytic performance and stability of Pt-based catalysts.

2. Bimetallic catalysts: Developing bimetallic catalysts, such as PtCu/Al2O3, which exhibit enhanced propylene selectivity and stability compared to monometallic catalysts.

3. Optimizing metal interactions: Inducing metal interactions (e.g., between Pt and Cu) to enhance propylene selectivity and anti-coking ability.

4. Facilitating product desorption: Designing catalysts that promote facile desorption of products (e.g., propylene) to reduce unwanted side reactions and coke formation.

5. Controlling electronic properties: Modifying the electronic environment of active sites to weaken adsorption of reactants/products and increase energy barriers for undesired reactions.

These advancements address challenges in catalyst design by:

1. Improving selectivity towards desired products
2. Enhancing catalyst stability and longevity
3. Reducing coke formation and catalyst deactivation
4. Suppressing unwanted side reactions
5. Optimizing metal-support interactions for better performance

For industrial applications, these strategies contribute to developing more efficient and durable catalysts, potentially leading to improved process economics and reduced downtime for catalyst regeneration or replacement.
