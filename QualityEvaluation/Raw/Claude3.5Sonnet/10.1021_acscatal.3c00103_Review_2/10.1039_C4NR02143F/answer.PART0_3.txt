[1] "Extensive investigations have been performed to improve the catalytic performance and stability of Pt-based catalysts for PDH. The addition of promoters such as Sn, La, Ga and Zn species has been reported to be effective."

[2] "Zhang et al. studied a PtSn/ZSM-5 catalyst and inferred that Sn could change the interfacial characteristics between the Pt metal and the ZSM-5 support, which facilitated the desorption of carbon deposits from metal clusters to the carrier, resulting in improved stability."

[3] "An enhanced catalytic performance of a zinc-doped platinum catalyst was reported by Yu et al. The weakened adsorption of propylene on the metal surface of PtZn/Al2O3, caused by the change of electronic environment of Pt, was proposed as the reason for the good anti-coking ability and high propylene selectivity."

[4] "The addition of promoters is reported to facilitate propylene desorption in the bimetallic PtZn/Al2O3 catalyst and the metal–metal interaction is recognized as the origin of the enhanced performance in propane dehydrogenation."

[5] "The Cu promoter plays a significant role in the reaction of PDH by inducing the metal interaction between Pt and Cu, which is the primary origin of the enhanced propylene selectivity and anti-coking ability of the PtCu/Al2O3 catalyst."

Recent strategies to enhance catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts in direct dehydrogenation processes include:

1. Adding promoters: Incorporating elements like Sn, La, Ga, Zn, and Cu to improve catalyst performance and stability.

2. Modifying interfacial characteristics: Changing the interface between metal and support to facilitate desorption of carbon deposits, as seen with PtSn/ZSM-5 catalysts.

3. Altering electronic environment: Weakening adsorption of reactants/products on the catalyst surface by changing the electronic environment of active metal sites, as demonstrated in PtZn/Al2O3 catalysts.

4. Inducing metal-metal interactions: Creating bimetallic catalysts (e.g., PtCu, PtZn) to enhance propylene selectivity and anti-coking ability through metal-metal interactions.

5. Facilitating product desorption: Promoting the desorption of products (e.g., propylene) to reduce side reactions and coke formation.

These advancements address challenges in catalyst design by improving stability, selectivity, and resistance to coking. They optimize performance for industrial applications by enhancing catalyst longevity and product yield while minimizing unwanted side reactions and deactivation.

最近提高直接脱氢过程中负载金属催化剂催化稳定性的策略包括：

1. 添加助剂：加入Sn、La、Ga、Zn和Cu等元素以提高催化剂性能和稳定性。

2. 修改界面特性：改变金属和载体之间的界面，以促进碳沉积物从金属簇向载体的脱附，如PtSn/ZSM-5催化剂所示。

3. 改变电子环境：通过改变活性金属位点的电子环境，减弱反应物/产物在催化剂表面的吸附，如PtZn/Al2O3催化剂所展示的。

4. 诱导金属-金属相互作用：创建双金属催化剂（如PtCu、PtZn），通过金属-金属相互作用增强丙烯选择性和抗积碳能力。

5. 促进产物脱附：促进产物（如丙烯）的脱附，以减少副反应和积碳形成。

这些进展通过提高稳定性、选择性和抗积碳能力解决了催化剂设计中的挑战。它们通过增强催化剂寿命和产品产率，同时最小化不需要的副反应和失活，优化了工业应用的性能。
