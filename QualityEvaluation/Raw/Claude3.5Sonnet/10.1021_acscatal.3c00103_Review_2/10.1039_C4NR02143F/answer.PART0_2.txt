[1] "Extensive investigations have been performed to improve the catalytic performance and stability of Pt-based catalysts for PDH. The addition of promoters such as Sn, La, Ga and Zn species has been reported to be effective."

[2] "PtCu/Al2O3 was examined by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and infrared spectroscopy of CO and propylene adsorption (CO-IR and C3H6-IR) to understand the interaction between Cu addition and the active sites of Pt."

[3] "The Cu addition causes a decrease of metal dispersion to 65.3%. Consistent with the results of H2 uptakes shown in Table 1, Cu was reported to have a lower H2 adsorption ability owing to its filled 3d electrical orbital, resulting in a weak electrical interaction with hydrogen atoms."

[4] "The Cu addition results in a downward shift of the CO band to 2058 cm1 with the two resolved peaks shifted to 2059 and 2021 cm1, while a relatively weak CO adsorption at 2160 cm1 that can be assigned to CO/Cu bands is also observed in Fig. 3b."

[5] "The PtCu interaction increases the propylene selectivity and minimizes coke formation by suppressing the propylene adsorption on the metal."

Recent strategies to enhance catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts in direct dehydrogenation processes include:

1. Addition of promoters: Incorporating elements like Sn, La, Ga, and Zn has been shown to improve catalytic performance and stability of Pt-based catalysts.

2. Bimetallic catalyst design: Creating bimetallic catalysts, such as PtCu, can enhance stability and selectivity. The interaction between metals alters the electronic environment of active sites.

3. Optimizing metal dispersion: Controlling the dispersion of active metal particles on the support to balance activity and stability.

4. Modifying adsorption properties: Tailoring the catalyst surface to weaken the adsorption of reactants/products, facilitating desorption and reducing coke formation.

5. Understanding metal-support interactions: Utilizing techniques like TEM and IR spectroscopy to elucidate the nature of interactions between metal particles and support materials.

These advancements address challenges in catalyst design by:

- Improving selectivity towards desired products
- Reducing coke formation and catalyst deactivation
- Enhancing thermal stability
- Optimizing metal-support interactions for better performance

For industrial applications, these strategies aim to develop catalysts with longer lifetimes, higher yields, and improved resistance to deactivation, ultimately leading to more efficient and economical dehydrogenation processes.
