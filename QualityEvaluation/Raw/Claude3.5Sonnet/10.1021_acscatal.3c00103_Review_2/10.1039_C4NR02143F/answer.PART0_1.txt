[1] "Extensive investigations have been performed to improve the catalytic performance and stability of Pt-based catalysts for PDH. The addition of promoters such as Sn, La, Ga and Zn species has been reported to be effective."

[2] "The addition of promoters is reported to facilitate propylene desorption in the bimetallic PtZn/Al2O3 catalyst and the metalmetal interaction is recognized as the origin of the enhanced performance in propane dehydrogenation."

[3] "The Cu promoter plays a significant role in the reaction of PDH by inducing the metal interaction between Pt and Cu, which is the primary origin of the enhanced propylene selectivity and anti-coking ability of the PtCu/Al2O3 catalyst."

[4] "The facile desorption of propylene from the PtCu/Al2O3 catalyst guarantees the high propylene selectivity by diminishing the possibility of polymerization reactions for coke formation and other undesired side reactions such as thermal cracking reactions forming lighter hydrocarbons."

Recent strategies to enhance catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts in direct dehydrogenation processes include:

1. Addition of promoters: Elements like Sn, La, Ga, Zn, and Cu have been added to Pt-based catalysts to improve performance and stability.

2. Bimetallic interactions: Forming bimetallic catalysts, such as PtZn or PtCu, creates metal-metal interactions that enhance catalytic properties.

3. Facilitating product desorption: Promoters and bimetallic interactions help facilitate the desorption of products (e.g. propylene), which improves selectivity and reduces coke formation.

4. Modifying electronic properties: The addition of promoters alters the electronic environment of active metal sites, which can increase energy barriers for undesired side reactions.

5. Suppressing coke formation: By facilitating product desorption and modifying catalyst properties, these strategies reduce the formation of coke deposits that lead to deactivation.

These advancements address challenges in catalyst design by improving selectivity, stability, and resistance to coking. They optimize performance for industrial applications by enhancing propylene yield and extending catalyst lifetime.
