          [1] "Extensive investigations have been performed to improve the catalytic performance and stability of Pt-based catalysts for PDH. The addition of promoters such as Sn, La, Ga and Zn species has been reported to be effective."

[2] "The addition of promoters is reported to facilitate propylene desorption in the bimetallic PtZn/Al2O3 catalyst and the metalmetal interaction is recognized as the origin of the enhanced performance in propane dehydrogenation."

[3] "PtCu/Al2O3 was examined by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and infrared spectroscopy of CO and propylene adsorption (CO-IR and C3H6-IR) to understand the interaction between Cu addition and the active sites of Pt."

[4] "The Cu addition results in an enhancement in propylene selectivity and catalyst stability, where PtCu0.5/Al2O3 exhibits the highest propylene selectivity with the lowest deactivation rate."

[5] "The Cu promoter plays a significant role in the reaction of PDH by inducing the metal interaction between Pt and Cu, which is the primary origin of the enhanced propylene selectivity and anti-coking ability of the PtCu/Al2O3 catalyst."

[6] "The facile desorption of propylene from the PtCu/Al2O3 catalyst guarantees the high propylene selectivity by diminishing the possibility of polymerization reactions for coke formation and other undesired side reactions such as thermal cracking reactions forming lighter hydrocarbons."

[7] "Zhang et al. studied a PtSn/ZSM-5 catalyst and inferred that Sn could change the interfacial characteristics between the Pt metal and the ZSM-5 support, which facilitated the desorption of carbon deposits from metal clusters to the carrier, resulting in improved stability."

[8] "An enhanced catalytic performance of a zinc-doped platinum catalyst was reported by Yu et al. The weakened adsorption of propylene on the metal surface of PtZn/Al2O3, caused by the change of electronic environment of Pt, was proposed as the reason for the good anti-coking ability and high propylene selectivity."

          Recent strategies to enhance catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts in direct dehydrogenation processes include:

1. Addition of promoters: Incorporating elements like Sn, La, Ga, Zn, and Cu to improve catalyst performance and stability.

2. Bimetallic catalyst design: Creating bimetallic catalysts such as PtCu/Al2O3, PtZn/Al2O3, and PtSn/ZSM-5 to enhance stability, selectivity, and anti-coking ability through metal-metal interactions.

3. Modifying electronic properties: Altering the electronic environment of active metal sites to weaken adsorption of reactants/products, facilitating desorption and reducing coke formation.

4. Optimizing metal-support interactions: Tailoring the interface between metal particles and support materials to improve stability and facilitate carbon deposit removal.

5. Facilitating product desorption: Promoting the desorption of products (e.g., propylene) to reduce side reactions and coke formation.

6. Controlling metal dispersion: Balancing metal dispersion on the support to optimize activity and stability.

These advancements address challenges in catalyst design by:
- Improving selectivity towards desired products
- Enhancing catalyst stability and longevity
- Reducing coke formation and catalyst deactivation
- Suppressing unwanted side reactions
- Optimizing metal-support interactions for better performance

For industrial applications, these strategies aim to develop catalysts with longer lifetimes, higher yields, and improved resistance to deactivation, ultimately leading to more efficient and economical dehydrogenation processes with reduced downtime for catalyst regeneration or replacement.
