Recent strategies to enhance catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts in direct dehydrogenation processes include:

1. Alloying Pt with transition metals like Sn, Ti, Ga, Cu, Co, Zn, Ir, and In. This improves overall catalytic performance.

2. Modifying the electronic structure of Pt surfaces through alloying. For example, adding Sn to Pt(111) lowers the energy barrier for propylene desorption while increasing the activation energy for further dehydrogenation. This improves propylene selectivity.

3. Selecting appropriate catalyst supports to modify catalytic performance. For instance, adding TiO2 to Pt/Al2O3 catalysts can improve propylene selectivity and stability.

4. Developing novel coreshell structures for Pt-based catalysts. These can improve catalytic performance while increasing the utilization efficiency of precious metals.

5. Optimizing metal particle size and dispersion on supports to balance activity and stability.

These strategies address key challenges in catalyst design by:

- Improving selectivity towards desired products
- Enhancing resistance to coking and deactivation 
- Increasing catalyst lifetime and stability
- Optimizing precious metal utilization
- Balancing activity and selectivity requirements

By fine-tuning the electronic and geometric properties of active sites, researchers aim to develop more stable and selective catalysts suitable for industrial dehydrogenation processes. The approaches focus on rational design at the atomic and molecular level to overcome limitations of traditional catalysts.
