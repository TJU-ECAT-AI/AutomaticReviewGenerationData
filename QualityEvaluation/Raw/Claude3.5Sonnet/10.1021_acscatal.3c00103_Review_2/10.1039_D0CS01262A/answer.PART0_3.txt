[1] "Alloying of Pt with one or more TMs, such as Sn, Ti, Ga, Cu, Co, Zn, Ir, and In, is an effective way to improve the catalytic performance in PDH."

[2] "The addition of Sn into Pt(111) can lower the energy barrier for propylene desorption and simultaneously increase the activation energy for propylene dehydrogenation"

[3] "PtSn surface alloys with different site coverages of Sn and PtSn bulk alloy have been investigated for ethane dehydrogenation via DFT calculations. The addition of Sn into Pt increases the CH and CC bond cleavage barriers, which inhibits the catalyst activity but favors ethylene selectivity over carbon formation."

[4] "The dopants can promote the dispersion of Pt particles and thus prevent their sintering, suppress the structure-sensitive side reactions including hydrogenolysis and deep dehydrogenation to reduce the rate of carbon deposition, and promote the migration of carbon deposition from active metal components to the carrier, etc."

[5] "Selecting suitable catalyst supports is also an effective way to modify the catalytic performance of metal catalysts for PDH."

Recent key strategies to enhance catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts in direct dehydrogenation processes include:

1. Alloying with transition metals: Incorporating metals like Sn, Ti, Ga, Cu, Co, Zn, Ir, and In into Pt catalysts has shown to improve catalytic performance. This approach modifies the electronic structure and binding properties of the catalyst surface.

2. Tuning desorption and activation energies: By alloying, the energy barrier for product (e.g. propylene) desorption can be lowered while increasing the activation energy for undesired further dehydrogenation. This improves selectivity towards the desired products.

3. Controlling bond cleavage barriers: Addition of elements like Sn increases CH and CC bond cleavage barriers, which while reducing overall activity, favors selectivity towards desired products and reduces carbon formation.

4. Improving dispersion and reducing sintering: Dopants can promote better dispersion of active metal particles (e.g. Pt) and prevent sintering, maintaining catalyst surface area and activity over time.

5. Suppressing side reactions: Alloying helps suppress structure-sensitive side reactions like hydrogenolysis and deep dehydrogenation, reducing carbon deposition rates.

6. Optimizing support materials: Careful selection of catalyst supports can modify the performance of the active metal, influencing activity, selectivity, and stability.

These advancements address industrial challenges by enhancing catalyst longevity, improving product selectivity, and reducing deactivation due to coking. They provide pathways for designing more efficient and stable catalysts for dehydrogenation processes, potentially leading to more economical and sustainable industrial applications.

近期提高直接脱氢过程中负载金属催化剂稳定性的关键策略包括：

1. 与过渡金属合金化：将Sn、Ti、Ga、Cu、Co、Zn、Ir和In等金属掺入Pt催化剂中，已证明可以提高催化性能。这种方法改变了催化剂表面的电子结构和结合特性。

2. 调节脱附和活化能：通过合金化，可以降低产物（如丙烯）脱附的能量障碍，同时增加不需要的进一步脱氢的活化能。这提高了对所需产物的选择性。

3. 控制键断裂障碍：添加Sn等元素增加了CH和CC键断裂障碍，虽然降低了整体活性，但有利于提高对所需产物的选择性并减少碳的形成。

4. 改善分散性和减少烧结：掺杂剂可以促进活性金属粒子（如Pt）的更好分散并防止烧结，长期保持催化剂的表面积和活性。

5. 抑制副反应：合金化有助于抑制结构敏感的副反应，如氢解和深度脱氢，减少碳沉积速率。

6. 优化载体材料：仔细选择催化剂载体可以改变活性金属的性能，影响活性、选择性和稳定性。

这些进展通过提高催化剂寿命、改善产品选择性和减少由于结焦造成的失活来解决工业挑战。它们为设计更高效和稳定的脱氢过程催化剂提供了途径，可能导致更经济和可持续的工业应用。
