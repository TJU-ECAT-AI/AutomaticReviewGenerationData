[2] "Alloying of Pt with one or more TMs, such as Sn, Ti, Ga, Cu, Co, Zn, Ir, and In, is an effective way to improve the catalytic performance in PDH."

[3] "The addition of Sn can help Pt re-disperse in the catalyst regeneration by providing nucleation sites on the γ-Al2O3 surface to achieve superior catalyst stability."

[4] "The dopants can promote the dispersion of Pt particles and thus prevent their sintering, suppress the structure-sensitive side reactions including hydrogenolysis and deep dehydrogenation to reduce the rate of carbon deposition, and promote the migration of carbon deposition from active metal components to the carrier, etc."

Recent strategies to enhance catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts in direct dehydrogenation processes include:

1. Alloying Pt with transition metals or main-group metals like Sn, Ti, Ga, Cu, Co, Zn, Ir, and In. This improves catalytic performance by modifying the electronic and geometric properties of the catalyst surface.

2. Selecting appropriate catalyst supports. Different supports can affect the dispersion and stability of metal particles.

3. Using dopants to promote metal dispersion, prevent sintering, suppress side reactions, reduce carbon deposition, and promote carbon migration from active sites to the support.

4. Adding Sn to help Pt re-disperse during catalyst regeneration by providing nucleation sites on supports like γ-Al2O3.

5. Employing atomic layer deposition (ALD) techniques, such as depositing alumina on Pt step edge sites to suppress unselective deep dehydrogenation and coke formation.

These advancements address key challenges in catalyst design by:

- Improving catalyst stability and lifetime through better metal dispersion and resistance to sintering
- Enhancing selectivity by suppressing unwanted side reactions 
- Reducing coking and deactivation by modifying surface properties and promoting carbon migration
- Enabling more efficient catalyst regeneration

Overall, these strategies aim to optimize the balance between activity, selectivity, and stability for industrial applications, focusing on tuning the catalyst's electronic and structural properties at the molecular level.

最近用于提高直接脱氢过程中负载金属催化剂催化稳定性的策略包括：

1. 将铂与过渡金属或主族金属如锡、钛、镓、铜、钴、锌、铱和铟合金化。这通过修改催化剂表面的电子和几何性质来提高催化性能。

2. 选择适当的催化剂载体。不同的载体可以影响金属颗粒的分散性和稳定性。

3. 使用掺杂剂来促进金属分散、防止烧结、抑制副反应、减少碳沉积，并促进碳从活性位点向载体迁移。

4. 添加锡以帮助铂在催化剂再生过程中重新分散，在γ-Al2O3等载体上提供成核位点。

5. 采用原子层沉积（ALD）技术，如在铂的台阶边缘位点沉积氧化铝，以抑制非选择性深度脱氢和焦炭形成。

这些进展通过以下方式解决了催化剂设计中的关键挑战：

- 通过更好的金属分散性和抗烧结性提高催化剂稳定性和寿命
- 通过抑制不需要的副反应来提高选择性
- 通过修改表面性质和促进碳迁移来减少结焦和失活
- 实现更高效的催化剂再生

总的来说，这些策略旨在为工业应用优化活性、选择性和稳定性之间的平衡，重点是在分子水平上调节催化剂的电子和结构性质。
