[1] "Alloying of Pt with one or more TMs, such as Sn, Ti, Ga, Cu, Co, Zn, Ir, and In, is an effective way to improve the catalytic performance in PDH."

[2] "The addition of Sn into Pt increases the CH and CC bond cleavage barriers, which inhibits the catalyst activity but favors ethylene selectivity over carbon formation."

[3] "The dopants can promote the dispersion of Pt particles and thus prevent their sintering, suppress the structure-sensitive side reactions including hydrogenolysis and deep dehydrogenation to reduce the rate of carbon deposition, and promote the migration of carbon deposition from active metal components to the carrier, etc."

[4] "Selecting suitable catalyst supports is also an effective way to modify the catalytic performance of metal catalysts for PDH."

[5] "The addition of an appropriate amount of TiO2 in Pt/TiO2Al2O3 catalysts can improve propylene selectivity and catalyst stability. The reasons are that the electrons could be transferred from the partially reduced TiOx (x < 2) to the Pt atoms, and the partial coverage of the metal surface by TiOx species, and thus the increased electron density of Pt can hinder propylene adsorption on active metal sites and facilitate coke migration from the active sites to the carrier."

Recent strategies to enhance catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts in direct dehydrogenation processes include:

1. Alloying Pt with other transition metals like Sn, Ti, Ga, Cu, Co, Zn, Ir, and In. This improves overall catalytic performance, particularly selectivity and coke resistance.

2. Using dopants to promote Pt particle dispersion, prevent sintering, suppress side reactions, and facilitate carbon migration from active sites to the support.

3. Careful selection of catalyst supports. For example, adding TiO2 to Pt/Al2O3 catalysts can improve propylene selectivity and stability.

4. Modifying electronic properties of the catalyst surface. In the case of TiO2-doped catalysts, electron transfer from partially reduced TiOx to Pt atoms increases electron density on Pt, hindering propylene adsorption and facilitating coke migration.

5. Optimizing metal-support interactions. Partial coverage of metal surfaces by support species (e.g., TiOx) can modify catalyst properties beneficially.

These advancements address key challenges in catalyst design by balancing activity, selectivity, and stability. They aim to reduce coking and sintering while maintaining or improving desired product yields. The strategies focus on tuning electronic and geometric properties of catalysts through composition and structure optimization, providing pathways for developing more efficient and durable catalysts for industrial applications.

最近提高直接脱氢过程中负载金属催化剂稳定性的策略包括：

1. 将铂与其他过渡金属如锡、钛、镓、铜、钴、锌、铱和铟合金化。这提高了整体催化性能，特别是选择性和抗积碳能力。

2. 使用掺杂剂促进铂粒子的分散，防止烧结，抑制副反应，并促进碳从活性位点迁移到载体。

3. 仔细选择催化剂载体。例如，向Pt/Al2O3催化剂中添加TiO2可以提高丙烯选择性和稳定性。

4. 修改催化剂表面的电子性质。在TiO2掺杂的催化剂中，部分还原的TiOx向铂原子的电子转移增加了铂上的电子密度，抑制了丙烯吸附并促进了积碳迁移。

5. 优化金属-载体相互作用。载体物种（如TiOx）对金属表面的部分覆盖可以有益地改变催化剂性质。

这些进展通过平衡活性、选择性和稳定性解决了催化剂设计中的关键挑战。它们旨在减少积碳和烧结，同时保持或提高所需产品的收率。这些策略侧重于通过成分和结构优化来调整催化剂的电子和几何特性，为开发更高效、更耐用的工业应用催化剂提供了途径。
