Recent key strategies to enhance catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts in direct dehydrogenation processes include:

1. Alloying Pt with transition metals like Sn, Ti, Ga, Cu, Co, Zn, Ir, and In. This improves overall catalytic performance.

2. Modifying Pt surfaces to lower propylene desorption energy barriers while increasing activation energy for further dehydrogenation. This enhances selectivity and reduces coke formation.

3. Optimizing catalyst supports, such as using TiO2-Al2O3 mixed oxides. The addition of TiO2 can improve propylene selectivity and catalyst stability.

4. Employing atomic layer deposition techniques, like depositing alumina on Pt step edges. This suppresses undesired deep dehydrogenation and coking.

These advancements address key challenges in catalyst design by:

- Enhancing selectivity towards desired products
- Reducing coke formation and improving catalyst longevity  
- Optimizing metal-support interactions for improved stability
- Precisely controlling catalyst surface structure at the atomic level

Overall, these strategies aim to develop more stable, selective, and long-lasting catalysts suitable for industrial dehydrogenation processes. They demonstrate progress in rationally designing catalysts by manipulating their composition and structure at the molecular level.

近期提高直接脱氢过程中负载金属催化剂稳定性的关键策略包括：

1. 将铂与锡、钛、镓、铜、钴、锌、铱和铟等过渡金属合金化。这可以提高整体催化性能。

2. 改性铂表面以降低丙烯脱附能垒，同时提高进一步脱氢的活化能。这提高了选择性并减少了积碳形成。

3. 优化催化剂载体，如使用TiO2-Al2O3混合氧化物。添加TiO2可以提高丙烯选择性和催化剂稳定性。

4. 采用原子层沉积技术，如在铂台阶边缘沉积氧化铝。这抑制了不需要的深度脱氢和积碳。

这些进展通过以下方式解决了催化剂设计中的关键挑战：

- 提高对目标产物的选择性
- 减少积碳形成并提高催化剂寿命
- 优化金属-载体相互作用以提高稳定性
- 在原子水平上精确控制催化剂表面结构

总的来说，这些策略旨在开发更稳定、选择性更高、寿命更长的催化剂，适用于工业脱氢过程。它们展示了通过在分子水平上操纵催化剂的组成和结构来理性设计催化剂的进展。
