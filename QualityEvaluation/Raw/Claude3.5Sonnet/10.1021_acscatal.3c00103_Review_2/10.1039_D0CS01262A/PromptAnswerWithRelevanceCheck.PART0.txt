[1] "Alloying of Pt with one or more TMs, such as Sn, Ti, Ga, Cu, Co, Zn, Ir, and In, is an effective way to improve the catalytic performance in PDH."

[2] "The addition of Sn into Pt increases the CH and CC bond cleavage barriers, which inhibits the catalyst activity but favors ethylene selectivity over carbon formation."

[3] "The dopants can promote the dispersion of Pt particles and thus prevent their sintering, suppress the structure-sensitive side reactions including hydrogenolysis and deep dehydrogenation to reduce the rate of carbon deposition, and promote the migration of carbon deposition from active metal components to the carrier, etc."

[4] "Selecting suitable catalyst supports is also an effective way to modify the catalytic performance of metal catalysts for PDH."

[5] "The addition of an appropriate amount of TiO2 in Pt/TiO2Al2O3 catalysts can improve propylene selectivity and catalyst stability. The reasons are that the electrons could be transferred from the partially reduced TiOx (x < 2) to the Pt atoms, and the partial coverage of the metal surface by TiOx species, and thus the increased electron density of Pt can hinder propylene adsorption on active metal sites and facilitate coke migration from the active sites to the carrier."

Recent strategies to enhance catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts in direct dehydrogenation processes include:

1. Alloying Pt with other transition metals like Sn, Ti, Ga, Cu, Co, Zn, Ir, and In. This improves overall catalytic performance, particularly selectivity and coke resistance.

2. Using dopants to promote Pt particle dispersion, prevent sintering, suppress side reactions, and facilitate carbon migration from active sites to the support.

3. Careful selection of catalyst supports. For example, adding TiO2 to Pt/Al2O3 catalysts can improve propylene selectivity and stability.

4. Modifying electronic properties of the catalyst surface. In the case of TiO2-doped catalysts, electron transfer from partially reduced TiOx to Pt atoms increases electron density on Pt, hindering propylene adsorption and facilitating coke migration.

5. Optimizing metal-support interactions. Partial coverage of metal surfaces by support species (e.g., TiOx) can modify catalyst properties beneficially.

These advancements address key challenges in catalyst design by balancing activity, selectivity, and stability. They aim to reduce coking and sintering while maintaining or improving desired product yields. The strategies focus on tuning electronic and geometric properties of catalysts through composition and structure optimization, providing pathways for developing more efficient and durable catalysts for industrial applications.
