[1] "Indeed, dozens of new PDH projects have been announced in the past few years. The installations proposed or being built will employ either CrOx/Al2O3 (Catofin) or PtSn/Al2O3 (Oleflex) catalysts."

[2] "Nevertheless, current dehydrogenation technologies still offer room for improvement, and thus further advances are needed to lower noble metal loading, increase catalyst stability, and/or improve the energy efficiency of the dehydrogenation process."

[3] "The addition of Sn to the Pt-based catalyst facilitates this migration by weakening the binding of the hydrocarbon to the metal."

[4] "Several strategies have been applied to control coke formation. For example, coke deposition can be dramatically reduced by using a support with little to no Brnsted acidity, or by poisoning the acid sites. Changes in the reaction conditions, such as cofeeding steam, hydrogen, or CO2, can reduce coke formation,"

[5] "Operando spectroscopy will provide the means for more sophisticated process control. Indeed, Raman/UVvis spectroscopy can be used to monitor noninvasively the amount and type of coke as the latter forms and accumulates on the catalyst surface."

Recent strategies to enhance catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts in direct dehydrogenation processes include:

1. Using bimetallic catalysts like PtSn/Al2O3, where Sn weakens hydrocarbon binding to Pt, facilitating coke migration and reducing deactivation.

2. Controlling coke formation by using supports with low Brønsted acidity or poisoning acid sites.

3. Modifying reaction conditions by cofeeding steam, hydrogen, or CO2 to reduce coke formation.

4. Employing operando spectroscopy (Raman/UV-vis) to monitor coke formation in real-time, allowing for more sophisticated process control and optimization of regeneration cycles.

5. Ongoing efforts to lower noble metal loading while maintaining or improving catalyst performance.

These advancements address challenges in catalyst design and performance optimization by targeting the main causes of deactivation, particularly coke formation. They aim to extend catalyst lifetime, improve selectivity, and enhance overall process efficiency for industrial applications.

最近用于提高直接脱氢过程中负载金属催化剂稳定性的策略包括：

1. 使用双金属催化剂如PtSn/Al2O3，其中Sn弱化烃类与Pt的结合，促进焦炭迁移并减少失活。

2. 通过使用低Brønsted酸性的载体或毒化酸性位点来控制焦炭形成。

3. 通过共进料蒸汽、氢气或CO2来改变反应条件，以减少焦炭形成。

4. 采用原位光谱技术（拉曼/紫外-可见光谱）实时监测焦炭形成，实现更复杂的过程控制和再生周期优化。

5. 持续努力降低贵金属载量，同时保持或改善催化剂性能。

这些进展通过针对失活的主要原因（尤其是焦炭形成）来解决催化剂设计和性能优化方面的挑战。它们旨在延长催化剂寿命、提高选择性，并提高工业应用的整体过程效率。
