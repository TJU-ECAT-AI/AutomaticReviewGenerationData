[1] "The addition of Sn to the Pt-based catalyst facilitates this migration by weakening the binding of the hydrocarbon to the metal."

[2] "To address this coke-induced deactivation, a regeneration step under an oxidative atmosphere has been incorporated to industrial dehydrogenation processes."

[3] "Several strategies have been applied to control coke formation. For example, coke deposition can be dramatically reduced by using a support with little to no Brnsted acidity, or by poisoning the acid sites."

[4] "Changes in the reaction conditions, such as cofeeding steam, hydrogen, or CO2, can reduce coke formation, whereas high partial pressures of olefins and paraffins exacerbate coke deposition."

[5] "Alternatively, coke deposition can be reduced by adding a promoter element, the addition of Sn to Pt-based dehydrogenation catalysts being the best-known example."

Recent strategies to enhance catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts in direct dehydrogenation processes include:

1. Adding promoter elements like Sn to Pt catalysts to weaken hydrocarbon binding and facilitate coke migration.

2. Incorporating regeneration steps using oxidative atmospheres to remove coke deposits.

3. Using supports with low Brønsted acidity or poisoning acid sites to reduce coke formation.

4. Modifying reaction conditions by cofeeding steam, hydrogen or CO2 to inhibit coke deposition.

5. Optimizing catalyst composition and reactor design to control coke formation and improve stability.

These advancements aim to address challenges in catalyst deactivation and extend catalyst lifetime for industrial applications. By controlling coke formation and enabling effective regeneration, these strategies allow for more stable and efficient dehydrogenation processes. However, further research is still needed to develop catalysts with even better long-term stability and selectivity for large-scale industrial use.

最近提高直接脱氢过程中负载金属催化剂稳定性的策略包括：

1. 向Pt催化剂中添加Sn等促进剂元素，以减弱碳氢化合物的结合并促进积炭迁移。

2. 引入氧化性气氛下的再生步骤，以去除积炭沉积。

3. 使用具有低Brønsted酸性的载体或毒化酸性位点，以减少积炭形成。

4. 通过共进料蒸汽、氢气或CO2来改变反应条件，抑制积炭沉积。

5. 优化催化剂组成和反应器设计，以控制积炭形成并提高稳定性。

这些进展旨在解决催化剂失活的挑战，并延长催化剂在工业应用中的寿命。通过控制积炭形成并实现有效再生，这些策略允许更稳定和高效的脱氢过程。然而，仍需进一步研究开发具有更好长期稳定性和选择性的催化剂，以用于大规模工业应用。
