Here are the relevant quotes and answers to the question:

<quotes>

[1] "Notably, there is a similarly advantageous market situation for the dehydrogenation of butanes, because the same conditions apply. Increased demand, especially from the automotive industry, combined with a decrease in supply due to the high cost of naphtha cracking, has resulted in sharp increases in butadiene prices. This in turn has sparked investment in new butane dehydrogenation (BDH) installations in the United States, China, and Japan."

[2] "Contrarily, others believe that for hydrogenolysis to take place, carbon deposits need to be in the vicinity of adsorbed hydrogen, which is more likely to occur on large Pt ensembles than on small particles."

[3] "Consequently, the progressive loss in activity with increasing time-on-stream is counteracted by gradual increases in temperature to afford a constant dehydrogenation activity throughout the entire catalyst life span."

[4] "The Oleflex process by UOP uses a very different reactor design comprising fluidized bed reactors, a catalyst regeneration unit, and a product recovery section."

[5] "Fortunately, these side reactions are catalyzed by specific sites that are not required for dehydrogenation, which means that high olefin yields can be obtained by careful catalyst design."

[6] "Nevertheless, as the thermal stability of these membranes is limited, this approach is more suited for the dehydrogenation of isobutene."

</quotes>

<EnglishVersionAnswer>

Recent strategies and approaches to enhance catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts in direct dehydrogenation processes include:

1. Careful catalyst design to minimize side reactions by targeting specific active sites. This allows for higher olefin yields while maintaining stability.

2. Gradual temperature increases during operation to counteract progressive activity loss over time. This helps maintain constant dehydrogenation activity throughout the catalyst lifespan.

3. Use of fluidized bed reactor designs with integrated catalyst regeneration units, as in the Oleflex process. This allows for continuous catalyst regeneration during operation.

4. Controlling particle size and metal dispersion. Smaller metal particles may reduce hydrogenolysis and carbon deposition that lead to deactivation.

5. Development of membrane reactor systems to selectively remove hydrogen and shift equilibrium. However, thermal stability limitations currently restrict this approach mainly to isobutene dehydrogenation.

6. Investment in new butane dehydrogenation installations utilizing improved catalyst and process designs, particularly in the US, China and Japan.

These advancements aim to address key challenges in catalyst stability, selectivity, and process efficiency for industrial dehydrogenation applications. The focus is on prolonging catalyst lifetime, reducing coking and side reactions, and enabling continuous operation through innovative reactor and regeneration designs. However, further improvements are still needed, particularly for higher temperature processes.

[1] "Indeed, dozens of new PDH projects have been announced in the past few years. The installations proposed or being built will employ either CrOx/Al2O3 (Catofin) or PtSn/Al2O3 (Oleflex) catalysts."

[2] "Nevertheless, current dehydrogenation technologies still offer room for improvement, and thus further advances are needed to lower noble metal loading, increase catalyst stability, and/or improve the energy efficiency of the dehydrogenation process."

[3] "The addition of Sn to the Pt-based catalyst facilitates this migration by weakening the binding of the hydrocarbon to the metal."

[4] "Several strategies have been applied to control coke formation. For example, coke deposition can be dramatically reduced by using a support with little to no Brnsted acidity, or by poisoning the acid sites. Changes in the reaction conditions, such as cofeeding steam, hydrogen, or CO2, can reduce coke formation,"

[5] "Operando spectroscopy will provide the means for more sophisticated process control. Indeed, Raman/UVvis spectroscopy can be used to monitor noninvasively the amount and type of coke as the latter forms and accumulates on the catalyst surface."

[1] "For instance, Fiedorow et al. showed that Pt/Al2O3 catalysts more readily sinter in an oxygen-containing atmosphere than in a hydrogen-containing atmosphere at temperatures above 600 C."

[2] "However, Pt can be redispersed on the catalyst by the addition of low amounts of oxygen and chlorine in the feed at temperatures around 500 C, although this process can only occur when the interaction between the support and the PtOx and PtOxCly species formed is such that mobile surface complexes are produced."

[3] "The addition of alkaline metals, such as Li, Na, and K, poisons these acid sites, suppressing the formation of coke on the support as shown in Figure 10."

[4] "Tin is by far the most studied promoter, and all of the platinum-based catalyst formulations that are industrially applied include this post-transition metal, the addition of which modifies both the platinum active phase and the support. Essentially, Sn suppresses hydrogenolysis and isomerization reactions, minimizes metal sintering, neutralizes the acidity of the support, and facilitates the diffusion of the coke species from the metal surface to the support."

[5] "To address this coke-induced deactivation, a regeneration step under an oxidative atmosphere has been incorporated to industrial dehydrogenation processes. This process is relatively straightforward, as coke is easily combusted in air at dehydrogenation reaction temperatures."

</quotes>

<EnglishVersionAnswer>

Several key strategies have been developed to enhance the catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts in direct dehydrogenation processes:

1. Controlled atmosphere: Using a hydrogen-containing atmosphere instead of oxygen-containing atmosphere during high-temperature operations can reduce sintering of platinum catalysts.

2. Redispersion techniques: Adding low amounts of oxygen and chlorine to the feed at around 500°C can help redisperse platinum on the catalyst surface, provided the right interaction exists between the support and formed PtOx and PtOxCly species.

3. Alkaline metal addition: Incorporating alkaline metals like Li, Na, and K can poison acid sites on the support, suppressing coke formation.

4. Tin promotion: Adding tin as a promoter to platinum catalysts is widely used industrially. Tin suppresses side reactions, minimizes sintering, neutralizes support acidity, and aids in moving coke species from the metal to the support.

5. Regeneration cycles: Incorporating oxidative regeneration steps to burn off coke deposits has become standard in industrial processes. This can be done effectively at typical dehydrogenation temperatures.

These advancements address key challenges in catalyst design and performance optimization by:
- Mitigating sintering and maintaining metal dispersion
- Reducing coke formation and its negative impacts
- Suppressing unwanted side reactions
- Enabling longer catalyst lifetimes through regeneration
- Balancing acidity/basicity of the catalyst system

By combining these approaches, more stable and selective catalysts can be developed for industrial dehydrogenation applications, allowing for improved process economics and efficiency.

在直接脱氢过程中，已经开发了几种关键策略来提高负载金属催化剂的催化稳定性：

1. 控制气氛：在高温操作过程中使用含氢气氛而不是含氧气氛可以减少铂催化剂的烧结。

2. 重新分散技术：在约500°C下向进料中添加少量氧和氯可以帮助铂在催化剂表面重新分散，前提是载体与形成的PtOx和PtOxCly物种之间存在适当的相互作用。

3. 碱金属添加：加入锂、钠、钾等碱金属可以毒化载体上的酸性位点，抑制焦炭形成。

4. 锡促进：在铂催化剂中添加锡作为促进剂在工业上被广泛使用。锡抑制副反应，最大限度地减少烧结，中和载体酸性，并有助于将焦炭物种从金属转移到载体上。

5. 再生循环：在工业过程中加入氧化再生步骤以燃烧焦炭沉积已成为标准做法。这可以在典型的脱氢温度下有效进行。

这些进展解决了催化剂设计和性能优化方面的关键挑战：
- 减轻烧结并保持金属分散性
- 减少焦炭形成及其负面影响
- 抑制不需要的副反应
- 通过再生实现更长的催化剂寿命
- 平衡催化剂系统的酸碱度

通过结合这些方法，可以为工业脱氢应用开发出更稳定、更选择性的催化剂，从而改善工艺经济性和效率。
