Here are the relevant quotes and answers to the question:

<quotes>

[1] "To address this coke-induced deactivation, a regeneration step under an oxidative atmosphere has been incorporated to industrial dehydrogenation processes. This process is relatively straightforward, as coke is easily combusted in air at dehydrogenation reaction temperatures."

[2] "Several strategies have been applied to control coke formation. For example, coke deposition can be dramatically reduced by using a support with little to no Brnsted acidity, or by poisoning the acid sites. Changes in the reaction conditions, such as cofeeding steam, hydrogen, or CO2, can reduce coke formation, whereas high partial pressures of olefins and paraffins exacerbate coke deposition."

[3] "Alternatively, coke deposition can be reduced by adding a promoter element, the addition of Sn to Pt-based dehydrogenation catalysts being the best-known example."

[4] "An alternative solution lies in the use of solid oxygen carriers, such as CeO2, SbO4, In2O3, WO3, PbOx, Tl2O3, and BiO3, capable of selectively oxidizing the hydrogen evolved by the SHC reaction."

[5] "Another method of removing the hydrogen from the reaction mixture is the introduction of membranes to the reactor system. This approach allows hydrogen to diffuse out of the reactor, shifting the equilibrium toward the desired olefin product."

Recent strategies to enhance catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts in direct dehydrogenation processes include:

1. Incorporating a regeneration step using an oxidative atmosphere to combust coke deposits.

2. Using supports with minimal Brnsted acidity or poisoning acid sites to reduce coke formation.

3. Modifying reaction conditions by cofeeding steam, hydrogen, or CO2 to reduce coke formation.

4. Adding promoter elements like Sn to Pt-based catalysts to reduce coke deposition.

5. Using solid oxygen carriers (e.g. CeO2, In2O3, WO3) to selectively oxidize hydrogen and shift equilibrium.

6. Introducing membranes to remove hydrogen from the reactor, shifting equilibrium toward olefin products.

These advancements address challenges in catalyst design and performance by targeting the main cause of deactivation (coke formation), modifying catalyst composition and structure, and altering reaction conditions to improve stability and selectivity. They aim to extend catalyst lifetime, increase olefin yields, and enhance overall process efficiency for industrial applications.

最近提高直接脱氢过程中负载金属催化剂稳定性的策略包括：

1. 在氧化性气氛下引入再生步骤，以燃烧焦炭沉积物。

2. 使用具有最小Brnsted酸性的载体或毒化酸性位点，以减少焦炭形成。

3. 通过共进料蒸汽、氢气或CO2来改变反应条件，减少焦炭形成。

4. 向Pt基催化剂中添加Sn等促进剂元素，以减少焦炭沉积。

5. 使用固体氧载体（如CeO2、In2O3、WO3）选择性氧化氢气，改变平衡。

6. 引入膜以从反应器中去除氢气，将平衡转向烯烃产物。

这些进展通过针对主要的失活原因（焦炭形成）、修改催化剂组成和结构、以及改变反应条件来提高稳定性和选择性，从而解决了催化剂设计和性能方面的挑战。它们旨在延长催化剂寿命、提高烯烃产率，并提高工业应用中的整体过程效率。
