Here are the relevant quotes and answers to the question:

[1] "Notably, there is a similarly advantageous market situation for the dehydrogenation of butanes, because the same conditions apply. Increased demand, especially from the automotive industry, combined with a decrease in supply due to the high cost of naphtha cracking, has resulted in sharp increases in butadiene prices. This in turn has sparked investment in new butane dehydrogenation (BDH) installations in the United States, China, and Japan."

[2] "Contrarily, others believe that for hydrogenolysis to take place, carbon deposits need to be in the vicinity of adsorbed hydrogen, which is more likely to occur on large Pt ensembles than on small particles."

[3] "Consequently, the progressive loss in activity with increasing time-on-stream is counteracted by gradual increases in temperature to afford a constant dehydrogenation activity throughout the entire catalyst life span."

[4] "The Oleflex process by UOP uses a very different reactor design comprising fluidized bed reactors, a catalyst regeneration unit, and a product recovery section."

[5] "Fortunately, these side reactions are catalyzed by specific sites that are not required for dehydrogenation, which means that high olefin yields can be obtained by careful catalyst design."

[6] "Nevertheless, as the thermal stability of these membranes is limited, this approach is more suited for the dehydrogenation of isobutene."

Recent strategies and approaches to enhance catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts in direct dehydrogenation processes include:

1. Careful catalyst design to minimize side reactions by targeting specific active sites. This allows for higher olefin yields while maintaining stability.

2. Gradual temperature increases during operation to counteract progressive activity loss over time. This helps maintain constant dehydrogenation activity throughout the catalyst lifespan.

3. Use of fluidized bed reactor designs with integrated catalyst regeneration units, as in the Oleflex process. This allows for continuous catalyst regeneration during operation.

4. Controlling particle size and metal dispersion. Smaller metal particles may reduce hydrogenolysis and carbon deposition that lead to deactivation.

5. Development of membrane reactor systems to selectively remove hydrogen and shift equilibrium. However, thermal stability limitations currently restrict this approach mainly to isobutene dehydrogenation.

6. Investment in new butane dehydrogenation installations utilizing improved catalyst and process designs, particularly in the US, China and Japan.

These advancements aim to address key challenges in catalyst stability, selectivity, and process efficiency for industrial dehydrogenation applications. The focus is on prolonging catalyst lifetime, reducing coking and side reactions, and enabling continuous operation through innovative reactor and regeneration designs. However, further improvements are still needed, particularly for higher temperature processes.

最近为提高直接脱氢过程中负载金属催化剂的催化稳定性而开发的策略和方法包括：

1. 通过针对特定活性位点来仔细设计催化剂，以最大程度地减少副反应。这允许在保持稳定性的同时获得更高的烯烃产率。

2. 在操作过程中逐步提高温度，以抵消随时间推移的活性逐渐损失。这有助于在整个催化剂寿命期间保持恒定的脱氢活性。

3. 使用带有集成催化剂再生单元的流化床反应器设计，如Oleflex工艺。这允许在操作过程中连续再生催化剂。

4. 控制粒径和金属分散度。较小的金属颗粒可能会减少导致失活的氢解和碳沉积。

5. 开发膜反应器系统，选择性地去除氢气并改变平衡。然而，热稳定性限制目前将这种方法主要限制在异丁烯脱氢。

6. 投资新的丁烷脱氢装置，利用改进的催化剂和工艺设计，特别是在美国、中国和日本。

这些进展旨在解决工业脱氢应用中催化剂稳定性、选择性和工艺效率方面的关键挑战。重点是通过创新的反应器和再生设计来延长催化剂寿命，减少结焦和副反应，并实现连续操作。然而，仍然需要进一步的改进，特别是对于高温工艺。
