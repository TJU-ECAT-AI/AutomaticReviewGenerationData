[1] "Many efforts have been made to improve the resistance to coke and to protect the active sites from aggregating, both of which are considered as the main reasons for catalyst deactivation."

[2] "Introduction of transition metal (Zn), alkaline metal (Na, K), alkaline earth metal (Mg, Ca), and rare earth metal (La, Ce), etc. into the catalysts as promotors offered another strategy to enhance the interaction between Pt and Sn and tune the acidbase property simultaneously."

[3] "The results showed that such a preparation procedure could efficiently enhance the interaction between the support and Pt, and compared with the sample where Pt and Sn were coimpregnated, the catalytic activity of propane dehydrogenation was therefore improved."

[4] "The redox property, ability of antisintering, and the resistance to coke deposition exhibited integrated effects in achieving better catalytic stability."

[5] "The In promotor helped the reaction stabilize in shorter time (3 h) and performed better in the long term catalytic stability test as the conversion lost only 12.8% and the selectivity of propylene was kept nearly constant in maximum of about 99.0% during 33 h time on stream."

Recent strategies to enhance catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts for direct dehydrogenation processes include:

1. Improving resistance to coke formation and preventing aggregation of active sites, which are major causes of deactivation.

2. Introducing promoter metals (transition, alkali, alkaline earth, rare earth) to enhance interaction between active metals and tune acid-base properties.

3. Optimizing catalyst preparation methods to strengthen metal-support interactions.

4. Focusing on integrated effects of redox properties, anti-sintering ability, and coke resistance to achieve better stability.

5. Using specific promoters like indium to stabilize reactions faster and maintain high conversion and selectivity over longer periods.

These advancements address challenges in catalyst design and performance by targeting key deactivation mechanisms, optimizing metal-support interactions, and tuning catalyst properties. The use of promoters and improved preparation methods helps create more stable and selective catalysts suitable for industrial applications.
