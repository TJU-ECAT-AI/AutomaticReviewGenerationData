[1] "Many efforts have been made to improve the resistance to coke and to protect the active sites from aggregating, both of which are considered as the main reasons for catalyst deactivation."

[2] "Introduction of transition metal (Zn), alkaline metal (Na, K), alkaline earth metal (Mg, Ca), and rare earth metal (La, Ce), etc. into the catalysts as promotors offered another strategy to enhance the interaction between Pt and Sn and tune the acidbase property simultaneously."

[3] "The various metals promoted Pt/Sn-SBA-15 catalysts (MPt/SSF, M = Ce, In, La, and Fe) were prepared by a conventional coimpregnation method"

[4] "The results further implied that the lattice oxygen played an important role in determining the initial activity in propane dehydrogenation as a linear relationship was achieved, while the integrated impacts of redox property, antisintering ability, and resistance to coke deposition were responsible for catalytic stability."

[5] "The In additive was helpful to form larger amounts of surface Pt oxides, and it could also promote the reduction of them and stabilize the metallic Pt under the reaction conditions, although the Pt oxides were only partially reduced according to the combined findings from TPR, XPS, and XRD."

Recent strategies to enhance catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts in direct dehydrogenation processes include:

1. Improving resistance to coke formation and preventing active site aggregation.

2. Introducing promoter metals like Zn, Na, K, Mg, Ca, La, and Ce to enhance Pt-Sn interaction and tune acid-base properties.

3. Preparing catalysts with various metal promoters (Ce, In, La, Fe) via coimpregnation method.

4. Optimizing lattice oxygen content to improve initial activity, while enhancing redox properties, anti-sintering ability, and coke resistance for better stability.

5. Using indium as a promoter to increase surface Pt oxides, promote their reduction, and stabilize metallic Pt under reaction conditions.

These advancements address challenges in catalyst design and performance by tackling the main causes of deactivation, optimizing metal-support interactions, and fine-tuning catalyst properties for improved activity and stability in industrial applications.
