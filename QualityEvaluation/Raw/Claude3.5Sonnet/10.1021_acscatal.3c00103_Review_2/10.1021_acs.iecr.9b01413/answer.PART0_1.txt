[1] "Many efforts have been made to improve the resistance to coke and to protect the active sites from aggregating, both of which are considered as the main reasons for catalyst deactivation."

[2] "Introduction of transition metal (Zn), alkaline metal (Na, K), alkaline earth metal (Mg, Ca), and rare earth metal (La, Ce), etc. into the catalysts as promotors offered another strategy to enhance the interaction between Pt and Sn and tune the acidbase property simultaneously."

[3] "The In additive was helpful to form larger amounts of surface Pt oxides, and it could also promote the reduction of them and stabilize the metallic Pt under the reaction conditions, although the Pt oxides were only partially reduced according to the combined findings from TPR, XPS, and XRD."

[4] "The redox property, ability of antisintering, and the resistance to coke deposition exhibited integrated effects in achieving better catalytic stability."

Recent strategies to enhance catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts in direct dehydrogenation processes include:

1. Improving resistance to coke formation and protecting active sites from aggregating. These are considered the main causes of catalyst deactivation.

2. Introducing promoter metals such as transition metals (Zn), alkaline metals (Na, K), alkaline earth metals (Mg, Ca), and rare earth metals (La, Ce). This enhances interaction between active metals like Pt and Sn, and tunes acid-base properties.

3. Using additives like In to increase surface Pt oxides, promote their reduction, and stabilize metallic Pt under reaction conditions. 

4. Optimizing redox properties, anti-sintering ability, and coke resistance in an integrated approach.

These advancements address challenges in catalyst design by targeting the main deactivation mechanisms. They aim to optimize metal-support interactions, tune surface properties, and balance redox behavior to enhance stability. The integrated approach recognizes that multiple factors contribute to long-term performance. Industrial applications benefit from catalysts with improved resistance to deactivation, allowing for longer operation times and higher yields.

近期提高直接脱氢过程中负载金属催化剂稳定性的策略包括：

1. 提高抗积碳能力并防止活性位点团聚。这些被认为是催化剂失活的主要原因。

2. 引入过渡金属（Zn）、碱金属（Na，K）、碱土金属（Mg，Ca）和稀土金属（La，Ce）等促进剂。这增强了活性金属如Pt和Sn之间的相互作用，并调节了酸碱性质。

3. 使用如In等添加剂来增加表面Pt氧化物，促进其还原，并在反应条件下稳定金属Pt。

4. 以综合方法优化氧化还原性能、抗烧结能力和抗积碳性能。

这些进展通过针对主要失活机制来解决催化剂设计中的挑战。它们旨在优化金属-载体相互作用，调节表面性质，平衡氧化还原行为以提高稳定性。综合方法认识到多个因素共同影响长期性能。工业应用从具有改进的抗失活能力的催化剂中受益，允许更长的操作时间和更高的产率。
