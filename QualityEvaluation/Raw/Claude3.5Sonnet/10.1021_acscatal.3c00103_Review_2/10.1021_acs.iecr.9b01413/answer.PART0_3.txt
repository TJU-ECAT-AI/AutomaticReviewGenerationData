[1] "Many efforts have been made to improve the resistance to coke and to protect the active sites from aggregating, both of which are considered as the main reasons for catalyst deactivation."

[2] "Introduction of transition metal (Zn), alkaline metal (Na, K), alkaline earth metal (Mg, Ca), and rare earth metal (La, Ce), etc. into the catalysts as promotors offered another strategy to enhance the interaction between Pt and Sn and tune the acidbase property simultaneously."

[3] "The addition of promotor affected significantly the crystallite size. Bigger Pt crystallite was formed in Ce and In promoted samples compared with the unpromoted sample Pt/SSF, increasing by 26% from 14.6 to 18.4 nm and 90% from 14.6 to 27.8 nm, respectively. On the contrary, La and Fe could restrict the growth of Pt crystallite; a size around 13.0 nm was consequently obtained."

[4] "Ce and In exhibited a super strong ability in stopping the Pt crystallite from growing under the reaction conditions, which evidently occurred over the La- and Fe-promoted catalysts from XRD results."

[5] "The redox property, ability of antisintering, and the resistance to coke deposition exhibited integrated effects in achieving better catalytic stability."

Recent key strategies to enhance catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts for direct dehydrogenation include:

1. Improving resistance to coke formation and preventing active site aggregation, which are major causes of deactivation.

2. Adding promoter metals like Zn, Na, K, Mg, Ca, La, and Ce to enhance Pt-Sn interactions and tune acid-base properties. 

3. Controlling Pt crystallite size through promoter addition. Some promoters like La and Fe restrict Pt crystallite growth, while others like Ce and In show strong ability to prevent Pt sintering during reactions.

4. Optimizing redox properties, anti-sintering ability, and coke resistance in an integrated way to achieve better stability.

5. Using promoters like In that can stabilize surface Pt particles while also promoting reduction of Pt oxides, leading to more oxygen vacancies that improve propylene selectivity and stability.

These approaches aim to address key challenges in catalyst design by targeting the main deactivation mechanisms, tuning surface properties, and stabilizing the active metal particles. The integrated effects of different promoters on multiple catalyst properties are leveraged to optimize overall performance and longevity for industrial applications.

最近改善直接脱氢反应中负载金属催化剂稳定性的关键策略包括：

1. 提高抗积炭能力并防止活性位点聚集，这是催化剂失活的主要原因。

2. 添加Zn、Na、K、Mg、Ca、La和Ce等促进剂金属，以增强Pt-Sn相互作用并调节酸碱性质。

3. 通过添加促进剂控制Pt晶粒尺寸。La和Fe等一些促进剂可以限制Pt晶粒生长，而Ce和In则表现出在反应过程中防止Pt烧结的强大能力。

4. 以综合方式优化氧化还原性能、抗烧结能力和抗积炭能力，以获得更好的稳定性。

5. 使用如In等促进剂，它们能够稳定表面Pt颗粒，同时促进Pt氧化物的还原，从而产生更多氧空位，提高丙烯选择性和稳定性。

这些方法旨在通过针对主要失活机制、调节表面性质和稳定活性金属颗粒来解决催化剂设计中的关键挑战。利用不同促进剂对多种催化剂性质的综合影响，以优化工业应用中的整体性能和寿命。
