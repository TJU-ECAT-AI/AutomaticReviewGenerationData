[1] "Many efforts have been made to improve the resistance to coke and to protect the active sites from aggregating, both of which are considered as the main reasons for catalyst deactivation."

[2] "Introduction of transition metal (Zn), alkaline metal (Na, K), alkaline earth metal (Mg, Ca), and rare earth metal (La, Ce), etc. into the catalysts as promotors offered another strategy to enhance the interaction between Pt and Sn and tune the acidbase property simultaneously."

[3] "The redox property, ability of antisintering, and the resistance to coke deposition exhibited integrated effects in achieving better catalytic stability."

[4] "The In additive was helpful to form larger amounts of surface Pt oxides, and it could also promote the reduction of them and stabilize the metallic Pt under the reaction conditions, although the Pt oxides were only partially reduced according to the combined findings from TPR, XPS, and XRD."

[5] "All of these were good for improving the propylene selectivity and the catalytic stability."

Recent strategies to enhance catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts for direct dehydrogenation processes include:

1. Improving resistance to coke formation and protecting active sites from aggregating, which are main causes of deactivation.

2. Introducing promoter metals like Zn, Na, K, Mg, Ca, La, and Ce to enhance interaction between active metals (e.g. Pt and Sn) and tune acid-base properties.

3. Optimizing redox properties, anti-sintering ability, and coke resistance in an integrated way.

4. Using promoters like In to increase surface Pt oxides, promote their reduction, and stabilize metallic Pt under reaction conditions.

5. Carefully selecting promoters to improve both propylene selectivity and catalyst stability.

These approaches aim to address challenges in catalyst design by enhancing metal-support interactions, tuning surface properties, and improving resistance to deactivation mechanisms. For industrial applications, they offer potential for developing more stable and selective catalysts with longer lifetimes. However, further work is likely needed to optimize these strategies for large-scale implementation.

近期为提高直接脱氢过程中负载金属催化剂的催化稳定性而开发的策略包括：

1. 提高抗积碳能力并防止活性位点聚集，这两者是导致失活的主要原因。

2. 引入Zn、Na、K、Mg、Ca、La和Ce等促进剂金属，以增强活性金属（如Pt和Sn）之间的相互作用，并调节酸碱性质。

3. 综合优化氧化还原性能、抗烧结能力和抗积碳能力。

4. 使用In等促进剂来增加表面Pt氧化物，促进其还原，并在反应条件下稳定金属Pt。

5. 谨慎选择促进剂以同时提高丙烯选择性和催化剂稳定性。

这些方法旨在通过增强金属-载体相互作用、调节表面性质和提高抗失活机制的能力来解决催化剂设计中的挑战。对于工业应用，它们为开发更稳定、更具选择性和更长寿命的催化剂提供了潜力。然而，可能还需要进一步的工作来优化这些策略以实现大规模应用。
