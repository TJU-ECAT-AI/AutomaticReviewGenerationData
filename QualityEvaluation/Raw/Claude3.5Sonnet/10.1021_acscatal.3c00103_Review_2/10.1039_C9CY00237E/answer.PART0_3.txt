[1] "The optimal 10Zn0.1Pt/HZ catalyst (consisting of 1000 ppm Pt and 10 wt% Zn) shows a high propylene yield (about 46%) and extraordinary dehydrogenation stability over 65 h at 525 C without any regeneration procedure or H2 as auxiliary gas."

[2] "It is revealed that this catalyst has two kinds of active centers which work corporately: (i) Lewis acidic sites created by framework Zn species and (ii) small-sized PtZn particles."

[3] "In addition, the stable state of the active species and strong carbon resistance of 10Zn0.1Pt/HZ related to the interaction effect between Pt and Zn are confirmed, accounting for the admirable reaction stability of PDH."

[4] "The high coke resistance and the stable state of Pt and Zn of the 10Zn0.1Pt/HZ catalyst cooperatively lead to such a superior stability."

[5] "Both the small-sized PtZn particles and Lewis acidic framework Zn species make contributions to the high catalytic activity of PDH, following a metalacid bifunctional mechanism, and a balance between the metal and acid functions can be realized on the 10Zn0.1Pt/HZ catalyst."

Recent strategies to enhance catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts in direct dehydrogenation processes include:

1. Developing bimetallic catalysts with optimized metal ratios: The 10Zn0.1Pt/HZ catalyst with 1000 ppm Pt and 10 wt% Zn shows high activity and stability.

2. Creating bifunctional active sites: Combining Lewis acidic sites from framework Zn species with small-sized PtZn particles.

3. Promoting metal-support interactions: The interaction between Pt and Zn enhances carbon resistance and stability of active species.

4. Optimizing metal dispersion: Small-sized PtZn particles contribute to high catalytic activity and stability.

5. Balancing metal and acid functions: Achieving synergy between metallic and acidic sites improves overall performance.

6. Enhancing coke resistance: Strong carbon resistance contributes to long-term stability without regeneration.

7. Operating at lower temperatures: The catalyst shows high performance at 525°C, which can reduce energy consumption and thermal degradation.

These advancements address challenges in catalyst design by improving activity, selectivity, and stability simultaneously. They optimize performance for industrial applications by eliminating the need for frequent regeneration or hydrogen co-feeding, potentially reducing operational costs and complexity in large-scale processes.
