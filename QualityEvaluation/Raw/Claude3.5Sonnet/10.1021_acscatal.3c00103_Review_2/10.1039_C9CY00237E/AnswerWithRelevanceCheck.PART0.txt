          [1] "The optimal 10Zn0.1Pt/HZ catalyst (consisting of 1000 ppm Pt and 10 wt% Zn) shows a high propylene yield (about 46%) and extraordinary dehydrogenation stability over 65 h at 525 C without any regeneration procedure or H2 as auxiliary gas."

[2] "It is revealed that this catalyst has two kinds of active centers which work corporately: (i) Lewis acidic sites created by framework Zn species and (ii) small-sized PtZn particles."

[3] "The stable state of the active species and strong carbon resistance of 10Zn0.1Pt/HZ related to the interaction effect between Pt and Zn are confirmed, accounting for the admirable reaction stability of PDH."

[4] "Both the small-sized PtZn particles and Lewis acidic framework Zn species make contributions to the high catalytic activity of PDH, following a metalacid bifunctional mechanism, and a balance between the metal and acid functions can be realized on the 10Zn0.1Pt/HZ catalyst."

[5] "The surface interactions between Pt and Zn are revealed by the H2-TPR and XPS measurements, leading to the strong coke resistance and the stable state of Pt and Zn of 10Zn0.1Pt/HZ which are responsible for the ultra-stable activity for PDH over 65 h at 525 C."

[6] "As a result, the supported Zn and a trace amount of Pt work corporately and result in high catalytic activity and great stability at 525 C, and this sheds a bright light on the design of other hyperstable dehydrogenation catalysts."

[7] "A high Zn/Pt ratio can lead to high dispersion and great thermal stability of metal phases"

[8] "The synergistic effect between Pt and Zn is proved by the H2-TPR results, in which the co-reduction peak of partial Pt and Zn is in between the reduction temperatures of platinum oxides and zinc oxides."

          Recent key strategies and approaches to enhance catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts in direct dehydrogenation processes include:

1. Developing bimetallic catalysts with optimized metal ratios: The 10Zn0.1Pt/HZ catalyst with 1000 ppm Pt and 10 wt% Zn shows high activity and stability.

2. Creating dual active centers: Combining Lewis acidic sites from framework Zn species with small-sized PtZn particles.

3. Utilizing metal-metal interactions: The interaction between Pt and Zn enhances carbon resistance and stability of active species.

4. Balancing metal and acid functions: Achieving synergy between metallic and acidic sites improves overall performance.

5. Optimizing metal dispersion: Small-sized PtZn particles and high Zn/Pt ratios contribute to high dispersion and thermal stability of metal phases.

6. Enhancing coke resistance: Strong carbon resistance contributes to long-term stability without regeneration.

7. Promoting synergistic effects: Co-reduction of Pt and Zn improves catalyst performance.

8. Operating at lower temperatures: The catalyst shows high performance at 525°C, reducing energy consumption and thermal degradation.

These advancements address challenges in catalyst design, fabrication, and performance optimization by:

1. Improving long-term stability without regeneration procedures or auxiliary gases.
2. Enhancing propylene yield and selectivity at lower temperatures.
3. Reducing coking and catalyst deactivation through strong carbon resistance.
4. Optimizing metal dispersion and preventing sintering during reactions.
5. Balancing acidity and metallic functions for improved catalytic performance.
6. Minimizing the use of expensive noble metals (e.g., Pt) while maximizing catalytic efficiency.

These strategies contribute to the development of more efficient, stable, and cost-effective catalysts for industrial applications in direct dehydrogenation processes.
