[1] "The optimal 10Zn0.1Pt/HZ catalyst (consisting of 1000 ppm Pt and 10 wt% Zn) shows a high propylene yield (about 46%) and extraordinary dehydrogenation stability over 65 h at 525 C without any regeneration procedure or H2 as auxiliary gas."

[2] "It is revealed that this catalyst has two kinds of active centers which work corporately: (i) Lewis acidic sites created by framework Zn species and (ii) small-sized PtZn particles."

[3] "The stable state of the active species and strong carbon resistance of 10Zn0.1Pt/HZ related to the interaction effect between Pt and Zn are confirmed, accounting for the admirable reaction stability of PDH."

[4] "A high Zn/Pt ratio can lead to high dispersion and great thermal stability of metal phases"

[5] "The synergistic effect between Pt and Zn is proved by the H2-TPR results, in which the co-reduction peak of partial Pt and Zn is in between the reduction temperatures of platinum oxides and zinc oxides."

Recent key strategies and approaches to enhance catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts in direct dehydrogenation processes include:

1. Developing bimetallic catalysts with optimized metal ratios, such as the 10Zn0.1Pt/HZ catalyst with 1000 ppm Pt and 10 wt% Zn.

2. Creating two types of active centers that work cooperatively: Lewis acidic sites from framework Zn species and small-sized PtZn particles.

3. Utilizing the interaction effect between metals (e.g., Pt and Zn) to achieve stable active species and strong carbon resistance.

4. Maintaining a high Zn/Pt ratio to promote high dispersion and thermal stability of metal phases.

5. Leveraging synergistic effects between metals, as evidenced by H2-TPR results showing co-reduction of Pt and Zn.

These advancements address challenges in catalyst design, fabrication, and performance optimization by:

1. Improving long-term stability without regeneration procedures or auxiliary gases.

2. Enhancing propylene yield and selectivity at lower temperatures.

3. Reducing coking and catalyst deactivation through strong carbon resistance.

4. Optimizing metal dispersion and preventing sintering during reactions.

5. Balancing acidity and metallic functions for improved catalytic performance.

These strategies contribute to the development of more efficient and stable catalysts for industrial applications in direct dehydrogenation processes.
