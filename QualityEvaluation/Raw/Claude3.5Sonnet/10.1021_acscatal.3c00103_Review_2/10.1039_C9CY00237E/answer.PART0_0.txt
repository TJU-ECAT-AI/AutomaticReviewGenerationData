[1] "The catalyst consisting of 1000 ppm platinum, 10 wt% zinc and a high-silica HZSM-5 support showed much better catalytic performance at 525 C than the sole Zn/HZ and Pt/HZ as well as 10ZnyPt/HZ catalysts with other Zn/Pt ratios."

[2] "Both the small-sized PtZn particles and Lewis acidic framework Zn species make contributions to the high catalytic activity of PDH, following a metalacid bifunctional mechanism, and a balance between the metal and acid functions can be realized on the 10Zn0.1Pt/HZ catalyst."

[3] "The surface interactions between Pt and Zn are revealed by the H2-TPR and XPS measurements, leading to the strong coke resistance and the stable state of Pt and Zn of 10Zn0.1Pt/HZ which are responsible for the ultra-stable activity for PDH over 65 h at 525 C."

[4] "As a result, the supported Zn and a trace amount of Pt work corporately and result in high catalytic activity and great stability at 525 C, and this sheds a bright light on the design of other hyperstable dehydrogenation catalysts."

Recent advancements in enhancing catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts for direct dehydrogenation processes include:

1. Using a combination of metals: Incorporating zinc and a small amount of platinum on a high-silica HZSM-5 support has shown superior catalytic performance compared to single-metal catalysts.

2. Optimizing metal ratios: Finding the optimal ratio between metals (in this case, Zn and Pt) is crucial for achieving the best catalytic activity and stability.

3. Employing a metal-acid bifunctional mechanism: Utilizing both small-sized PtZn particles and Lewis acidic framework Zn species contributes to high catalytic activity.

4. Promoting surface interactions between metals: The interaction between Pt and Zn leads to strong coke resistance and stable metal states, resulting in ultra-stable activity.

5. Balancing metal and acid functions: Achieving the right balance between metal and acid functions on the catalyst surface is key to optimal performance.

6. Controlling particle size: Small-sized PtZn particles contribute to improved catalytic activity.

7. Utilizing high-silica supports: The use of high-silica HZSM-5 as a support material plays a role in enhancing catalyst performance.

These strategies address challenges in catalyst design by improving stability, reducing coke formation, and optimizing activity at lower temperatures. They also offer potential for industrial applications by eliminating the need for frequent regeneration and reducing platinum usage, thus lowering costs and improving process efficiency.
