[1] "The optimal 10Zn0.1Pt/HZ catalyst (consisting of 1000 ppm Pt and 10 wt% Zn) shows a high propylene yield (about 46%) and extraordinary dehydrogenation stability over 65 h at 525 C without any regeneration procedure or H2 as auxiliary gas."

[2] "It is revealed that this catalyst has two kinds of active centers which work corporately: (i) Lewis acidic sites created by framework Zn species and (ii) small-sized PtZn particles."

[3] "The stable state of the active species and strong carbon resistance of 10Zn0.1Pt/HZ related to the interaction effect between Pt and Zn are confirmed, accounting for the admirable reaction stability of PDH."

[4] "This catalyst contains much more Zn and less Pt than previously reported PtZn-based dehydrogenation catalysts, breaking the traditional understanding about PtZn catalysts and opening a wide avenue for the design of stable dehydrogenation catalysts."

[5] "The high coke resistance and the stable state of Pt and Zn of the 10Zn0.1Pt/HZ catalyst cooperatively lead to such a superior stability."

Recent strategies to enhance catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts in direct dehydrogenation processes include:

1. Developing bimetallic catalysts with optimized metal ratios, such as the 10Zn0.1Pt/HZ catalyst with high Zn content and low Pt loading.

2. Creating dual active centers: Lewis acidic sites from framework Zn species and small-sized PtZn particles.

3. Promoting strong interactions between metal components (e.g., Pt and Zn) to improve stability and carbon resistance.

4. Designing catalysts with high coke resistance to maintain long-term stability.

5. Optimizing metal dispersion and particle size to enhance catalytic performance and stability.

6. Utilizing high-silica zeolite supports like HZSM-5 to provide a stable framework for metal species.

These advancements address challenges in catalyst design by:

1. Improving catalytic activity and stability at lower temperatures (e.g., 525°C) without regeneration or H2 co-feeding.

2. Reducing the use of expensive noble metals like Pt while maintaining high performance.

3. Enhancing resistance to deactivation caused by coking and metal sintering.

4. Providing a new approach to design stable dehydrogenation catalysts for industrial applications, challenging traditional understanding of PtZn catalysts.
