[1] "The optimal 10Zn0.1Pt/HZ catalyst (consisting of 1000 ppm Pt and 10 wt% Zn) shows a high propylene yield (about 46%) and extraordinary dehydrogenation stability over 65 h at 525 C without any regeneration procedure or H2 as auxiliary gas."

[2] "It is revealed that this catalyst has two kinds of active centers which work corporately: (i) Lewis acidic sites created by framework Zn species and (ii) small-sized PtZn particles."

[3] "The stable state of the active species and strong carbon resistance of 10Zn0.1Pt/HZ related to the interaction effect between Pt and Zn are confirmed, accounting for the admirable reaction stability of PDH."

[4] "The co-impregnation of Zn and a trace amount of Pt greatly prolongs the lifetime of the PDH reaction with high catalytic performance."

[5] "Thus, the combination of Zn and extremely low Pt can result in a high catalytic activity and extraordinary stability in the PDH reaction at 525 C."

Recent strategies to enhance catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts in direct dehydrogenation processes include:

1. Developing bimetallic catalysts with optimized metal ratios, such as the 10Zn0.1Pt/HZ catalyst with 1000 ppm Pt and 10 wt% Zn.

2. Creating dual active centers: Lewis acidic sites from framework Zn species and small-sized PtZn particles.

3. Utilizing the interaction effect between metals (e.g., Pt and Zn) to improve carbon resistance and stability of active species.

4. Co-impregnation of metals in trace amounts (e.g., Zn with small amounts of Pt) to prolong catalyst lifetime.

5. Optimizing metal loadings to achieve a balance between catalytic activity and stability.

These advancements address challenges in catalyst design by:

1. Improving long-term stability without regeneration or auxiliary gases.
2. Enhancing propylene yield and selectivity.
3. Reducing coking and catalyst deactivation.
4. Lowering operational temperatures (e.g., 525°C) while maintaining high performance.
5. Minimizing the use of expensive noble metals (e.g., Pt) while maximizing catalytic efficiency.

These strategies contribute to the development of more efficient, stable, and cost-effective catalysts for industrial applications in direct dehydrogenation processes.
