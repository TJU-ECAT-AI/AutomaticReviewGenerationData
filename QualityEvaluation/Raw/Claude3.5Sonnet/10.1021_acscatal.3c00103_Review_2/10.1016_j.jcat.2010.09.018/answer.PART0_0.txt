[1] "Sn is often added to alter the product distribution for hydrocarbon conversion through the inhibition of hydrogenolysis, isomerisation, cracking and coke formation, thereby enhancing the catalyst selectivity and stability"

[2] "The presence of Sn as a promoter drastically improves the catalytic behavior. The PtSn/Al2O3 catalyst material possesses both a higher propane conversion and propene selectivity, which is maintained throughout the duration of the first dehydrogenation step."

[3] "The presence of Sn not only modifies the electronic properties of the Pt nanoparticles and therefore the activation of propane but also produces a drain-off effect. This drain-off effect keeps the Pt sites clean by removing the coke precursors from the vicinity of active sites to the support."

[4] "Kumar et al. proposed a modified drain-off effect, which is based on a combination of the electronic and drain-off effects."

Recent strategies to enhance catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts in direct dehydrogenation processes include:

1. Adding promoters like Sn to inhibit side reactions and coke formation, improving selectivity and stability.

2. Modifying the electronic properties of active metal nanoparticles (e.g. Pt) through promoter addition.

3. Utilizing the "drain-off effect" where promoters help keep active sites clean by facilitating migration of coke precursors away from active sites.

4. Combining electronic modification and drain-off effects, as proposed in the "modified drain-off effect".

These advancements address challenges in catalyst design by:
- Improving product selectivity 
- Enhancing catalyst stability and lifetime
- Reducing deactivation due to coking
- Optimizing the electronic properties of active sites

The strategies aim to create more robust catalysts suitable for prolonged use in industrial dehydrogenation processes.
