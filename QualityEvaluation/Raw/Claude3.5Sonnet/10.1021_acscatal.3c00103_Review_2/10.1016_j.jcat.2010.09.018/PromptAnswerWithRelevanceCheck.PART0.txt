[1] "Sn is often added to alter the product distribution for hydrocarbon conversion through the inhibition of hydrogenolysis, isomerisation, cracking and coke formation, thereby enhancing the catalyst selectivity and stability"

[2] "The presence of Sn as a promoter drastically improves the catalytic behavior. The PtSn/Al2O3 catalyst material possesses both a higher propane conversion and propene selectivity, which is maintained throughout the duration of the first dehydrogenation step."

[3] "The presence of Sn not only modifies the electronic properties of the Pt nanoparticles and therefore the activation of propane but also produces a drain-off effect. This drain-off effect keeps the Pt sites clean by removing the coke precursors from the vicinity of active sites to the support."

[4] "Kumar et al. proposed a modified drain-off effect, which is based on a combination of the electronic and drain-off effects."

[2] "The presence of Sn not only reduces the amount of coke formed during a propane dehydrogenation run but also modifies its rate of formation."

[3] "It suggests that coke precursors such as olefinic species adsorb less strongly on the PtSn bimetallic catalyst due to an ensemble effect of Sn. Therefore, coke precursors are mobile and easily migrate to the support where they finally deposit as coke."

[4] "Kumar et al. proposed a modified drain-off effect, which is based on a combination of the electronic and drain-off effects."

Recent strategies to enhance catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts in direct dehydrogenation processes include:

1. Adding promoters like Sn to inhibit undesired side reactions and coke formation. This improves catalyst selectivity and stability.

2. Developing bimetallic catalysts, such as PtSn, which modify the electronic properties and coke formation behavior compared to monometallic catalysts.

Recent strategies to enhance catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts in direct dehydrogenation processes include:

1. Addition of promoters like Sn to Pt catalysts. This alters product distribution by inhibiting unwanted side reactions and coke formation, thus improving selectivity and stability.

2. Utilizing bimetallic catalysts (e.g. PtSn) to modify electronic properties of active metal sites and create a "drain-off effect". This keeps active sites clean by facilitating migration of coke precursors to the support.

3. Exploiting ensemble effects in bimetallic catalysts. For example, Sn weakens adsorption of coke precursors on PtSn, allowing them to more easily migrate away from active sites.

4. Optimizing metal-support interactions to enhance coke resistance. The support acts as a sink for mobile coke precursors that migrate from active metal sites.

These advancements address catalyst deactivation challenges by mitigating coke formation and improving stability, while maintaining or enhancing activity and selectivity for industrial dehydrogenation applications.
