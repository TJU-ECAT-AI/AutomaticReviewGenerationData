[1] "Sn is often added to alter the product distribution for hydrocarbon conversion through the inhibition of hydrogenolysis, isomerisation, cracking and coke formation, thereby enhancing the catalyst selectivity and stability"

[2] "The presence of Sn as a promoter drastically improves the catalytic behavior. The PtSn/Al2O3 catalyst material possesses both a higher propane conversion and propene selectivity, which is maintained throughout the duration of the first dehydrogenation step."

[3] "The presence of Sn not only modifies the electronic properties of the Pt nanoparticles and therefore the activation of propane but also produces a drain-off effect. This drain-off effect keeps the Pt sites clean by removing the coke precursors from the vicinity of active sites to the support."

[4] "It suggests that coke precursors adsorb less strongly on the PtSn bimetallic catalyst due to an ensemble effect of Sn. Therefore, coke precursors are mobile and easily migrate to the support where they finally deposit as coke."

Recent strategies to enhance catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts in direct dehydrogenation processes include:

1. Adding promoters like Sn to Pt catalysts. This inhibits side reactions and coke formation, improving selectivity and stability.

2. Developing bimetallic catalysts like PtSn/Al2O3. These show higher conversion, selectivity, and durability compared to monometallic catalysts.

3. Utilizing electronic and ensemble effects. Sn modifies Pt's electronic properties and creates an ensemble effect, changing how reactants interact with the catalyst surface.

4. Implementing a "drain-off" effect. This keeps active metal sites clean by facilitating the migration of coke precursors away from active sites to the support.

5. Optimizing metal-support interactions. The support plays a role in coke deposition and catalyst stability.

These advancements address challenges in catalyst design by modifying the electronic and structural properties of active sites, controlling coke formation and deposition, and maintaining catalyst activity over longer periods. This helps optimize catalyst performance for industrial applications by improving conversion, selectivity, and longevity.

最近提高直接脱氢过程中负载金属催化剂催化稳定性的策略包括：

1. 向Pt催化剂中添加Sn等助剂。这抑制了副反应和积碳形成，提高了选择性和稳定性。

2. 开发PtSn/Al2O3等双金属催化剂。与单金属催化剂相比，这些催化剂表现出更高的转化率、选择性和耐久性。

3. 利用电子效应和集合效应。Sn改变了Pt的电子性质，并产生了集合效应，改变了反应物与催化剂表面的相互作用方式。

4. 实施"排出"效应。这通过促进积碳前体从活性位迁移到载体，保持活性金属位点的清洁。

5. 优化金属-载体相互作用。载体在积碳沉积和催化剂稳定性方面发挥作用。

这些进展通过修改活性位点的电子和结构性质、控制积碳形成和沉积以及维持催化剂长期活性来解决催化剂设计中的挑战。这有助于通过提高转化率、选择性和寿命来优化工业应用的催化剂性能。
