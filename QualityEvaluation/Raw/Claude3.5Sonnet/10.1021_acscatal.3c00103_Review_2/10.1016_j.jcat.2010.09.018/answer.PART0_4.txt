[1] "Sn is often added to alter the product distribution for hydrocarbon conversion through the inhibition of hydrogenolysis, isomerisation, cracking and coke formation, thereby enhancing the catalyst selectivity and stability"

[2] "The presence of Sn not only reduces the amount of coke formed during a propane dehydrogenation run but also modifies its rate of formation."

[3] "The presence of Sn not only modifies the electronic properties of the Pt nanoparticles and therefore the activation of propane but also produces a drain-off effect. This drain-off effect keeps the Pt sites clean by removing the coke precursors from the vicinity of active sites to the support."

[4] "It suggests that coke precursors adsorb less strongly on the PtSn bimetallic catalyst due to an ensemble effect of Sn. Therefore, coke precursors are mobile and easily migrate to the support where they finally deposit as coke."

Recent strategies to enhance catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts in direct dehydrogenation processes include:

1. Addition of promoters like Sn to Pt catalysts. This alters product distribution by inhibiting unwanted side reactions and coke formation, thus improving selectivity and stability.

2. Utilizing bimetallic catalysts (e.g. PtSn) to modify electronic properties of active metal sites and create a "drain-off effect". This keeps active sites clean by facilitating migration of coke precursors to the support.

3. Exploiting ensemble effects in bimetallic catalysts. For example, Sn weakens adsorption of coke precursors on PtSn, allowing them to more easily migrate away from active sites.

4. Optimizing metal-support interactions to enhance coke resistance. The support acts as a sink for mobile coke precursors that migrate from active metal sites.

These advancements address catalyst deactivation challenges by mitigating coke formation and improving stability, while maintaining or enhancing activity and selectivity for industrial dehydrogenation applications.

最近提高直接脱氢过程中负载金属催化剂的催化稳定性的策略包括：

1. 向Pt催化剂中添加如Sn等助剂。这通过抑制不需要的副反应和焦炭形成来改变产物分布，从而提高选择性和稳定性。

2. 利用双金属催化剂（如PtSn）来修改活性金属位点的电子性质并创造"排出效应"。这通过促进焦炭前体向载体迁移来保持活性位点清洁。

3. 利用双金属催化剂中的集合效应。例如，Sn削弱了焦炭前体在PtSn上的吸附，使它们更容易从活性位点迁移。

4. 优化金属-载体相互作用以增强抗焦炭能力。载体充当从活性金属位点迁移的移动焦炭前体的汇。

这些进展通过减轻焦炭形成和提高稳定性来解决催化剂失活挑战，同时保持或提高工业脱氢应用的活性和选择性。
