[1] "Sn is often added to alter the product distribution for hydrocarbon conversion through the inhibition of hydrogenolysis, isomerisation, cracking and coke formation, thereby enhancing the catalyst selectivity and stability"

[2] "The presence of Sn as a promoter drastically improves the catalytic behavior. The PtSn/Al2O3 catalyst material possesses both a higher propane conversion and propene selectivity, which is maintained throughout the duration of the first dehydrogenation step."

[3] "This drain-off effect keeps the Pt sites clean by removing the coke precursors from the vicinity of active sites to the support. This hypothesis was first proposed by Lieske et al. and has been discussed in the context of a particle ensemble effect"

[4] "Kumar et al. proposed a modified drain-off effect, which is based on a combination of the electronic and drain-off effects."

Recent strategies to enhance catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts for direct dehydrogenation include:

1. Addition of promoters: Adding Sn as a promoter to Pt catalysts improves catalytic behavior by inhibiting side reactions and coke formation, enhancing selectivity and stability.

2. Bimetallic catalysts: Using PtSn bimetallic catalysts instead of monometallic Pt catalysts shows higher conversion, selectivity, and stability.

3. Drain-off effect: This keeps active sites clean by removing coke precursors from metal sites to the support, maintaining catalyst activity.

4. Modified drain-off effect: Combines electronic effects with the drain-off effect to further improve catalyst performance.

These advancements address challenges in catalyst design by modifying the electronic and structural properties of active sites, reducing coking, and maintaining catalyst activity over longer periods. They aim to optimize catalyst performance for industrial applications by increasing selectivity, conversion, and stability.

最近用于提高直接脱氢过程中负载金属催化剂催化稳定性的策略包括：

1. 添加助剂：向Pt催化剂中添加Sn作为助剂可以通过抑制副反应和积碳形成来改善催化行为，提高选择性和稳定性。

2. 双金属催化剂：使用PtSn双金属催化剂代替单金属Pt催化剂表现出更高的转化率、选择性和稳定性。

3. 排流效应：这种效应通过将积碳前体从金属位点移除到载体上，保持活性位点清洁，维持催化剂活性。

4. 改进的排流效应：将电子效应与排流效应相结合，进一步提高催化剂性能。

这些进展通过修改活性位点的电子和结构特性、减少积碳、延长催化剂活性维持时间来解决催化剂设计中的挑战。它们旨在通过提高选择性、转化率和稳定性来优化催化剂在工业应用中的性能。
