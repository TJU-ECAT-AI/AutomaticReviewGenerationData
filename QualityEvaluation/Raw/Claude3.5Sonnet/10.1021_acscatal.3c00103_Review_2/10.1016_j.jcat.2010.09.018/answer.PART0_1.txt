[1] "Sn is often added to alter the product distribution for hydrocarbon conversion through the inhibition of hydrogenolysis, isomerisation, cracking and coke formation, thereby enhancing the catalyst selectivity and stability"

[2] "The presence of Sn not only reduces the amount of coke formed during a propane dehydrogenation run but also modifies its rate of formation."

[3] "It suggests that coke precursors such as olefinic species adsorb less strongly on the PtSn bimetallic catalyst due to an ensemble effect of Sn. Therefore, coke precursors are mobile and easily migrate to the support where they finally deposit as coke."

[4] "Kumar et al. proposed a modified drain-off effect, which is based on a combination of the electronic and drain-off effects."

Recent strategies to enhance catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts in direct dehydrogenation processes include:

1. Adding promoters like Sn to inhibit undesired side reactions and coke formation. This improves catalyst selectivity and stability.

2. Developing bimetallic catalysts, such as PtSn, which modify the electronic properties and coke formation behavior compared to monometallic catalysts.

3. Utilizing the "drain-off effect", where coke precursors adsorb less strongly on bimetallic surfaces and migrate to the support instead of deactivating active sites. 

4. Combining electronic effects and the drain-off effect in a "modified drain-off effect" to further enhance catalyst performance.

These advancements address challenges in catalyst design by modifying the active sites to reduce deactivation, improving selectivity towards desired products, and prolonging catalyst lifetime. They optimize performance for industrial applications by maintaining activity over multiple reaction-regeneration cycles.

最近为提高直接脱氢过程中负载金属催化剂的催化稳定性而开发的策略包括：

1. 添加如Sn等助剂以抑制不良副反应和积碳形成。这提高了催化剂的选择性和稳定性。

2. 开发双金属催化剂，如PtSn，与单金属催化剂相比，这种催化剂改变了电子性质和积碳形成行为。

3. 利用"流失效应"，其中积碳前体在双金属表面的吸附较弱，转而迁移到载体上，而不是使活性位点失活。

4. 结合电子效应和流失效应的"改进流失效应"，进一步增强催化剂性能。

这些进展通过修改活性位点以减少失活、提高对目标产物的选择性以及延长催化剂寿命来解决催化剂设计中的挑战。它们通过在多个反应-再生循环中保持活性来优化工业应用的性能。
