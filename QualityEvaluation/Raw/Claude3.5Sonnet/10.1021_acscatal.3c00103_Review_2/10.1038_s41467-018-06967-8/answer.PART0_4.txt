[1] "We synthesize γ-alumina-supported platinum/copper SAA catalysts by incipient wetness co-impregnation method with a high copper to platinum ratio."

[2] "Single platinum atoms dispersed on copper nanoparticles dramatically enhance the desorption of surface-bounded propylene and prohibit its further dehydrogenation, resulting in high propylene selectivity (90%)."

[3] "Unlike previous reported SAA applications at low temperatures (<400C), Pt/Cu SAA shows excellent stability of more than 120h of operation under atmospheric pressure at 520C."

[4] "Our DFT calculations suggest that Pt/Cu SAA indeed breaks the PtM alloy scaling relationship, which is different from the scaling for conventional Pt alloys during the PDH"

[5] "The variation trend of CO adsorption behavior is highly consistent with that of the initial activities of the catalysts as the Cu content increases."

The key strategies and approaches recently developed to enhance the catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts in direct dehydrogenation processes include:

1. Single Atom Alloy (SAA) catalysts: Synthesizing γ-alumina-supported platinum/copper SAA catalysts with a high copper to platinum ratio. This approach breaks the scaling relationship observed in conventional PtM alloys.

2. Atomic dispersion: Dispersing single platinum atoms on copper nanoparticles, which enhances propylene desorption and inhibits further dehydrogenation, resulting in high propylene selectivity.

3. High-temperature stability: Developing SAA catalysts that maintain excellent stability for extended periods (over 120 hours) at high temperatures (520°C), unlike previous SAA applications limited to lower temperatures.

4. Optimizing metal ratios: Carefully controlling the ratio of copper to platinum to achieve the desired catalytic properties and stability.

5. Characterization techniques: Using advanced characterization methods like CO-DRIFTS to correlate CO adsorption behavior with initial catalyst activities, allowing for optimization of catalyst composition.

These advancements address challenges in catalyst design, fabrication, and performance optimization by:

1. Breaking the activity-selectivity trade-off typically observed in conventional alloy catalysts.
2. Improving catalyst stability at industrially relevant high temperatures.
3. Enhancing propylene selectivity while maintaining reasonable dehydrogenation activity.
4. Providing a new approach to catalyst design that can be potentially applied to other industrially important reactions.
5. Offering insights into the relationship between catalyst structure and performance, enabling more targeted catalyst development for industrial applications.

最近开发的增强直接脱氢过程中负载金属催化剂稳定性的关键策略和方法包括：

1. 单原子合金（SAA）催化剂：合成具有高铜铂比的γ-氧化铝负载铂/铜SAA催化剂。这种方法打破了传统PtM合金中观察到的比例关系。

2. 原子分散：将单个铂原子分散在铜纳米粒子上，这增强了丙烯的脱附并抑制了进一步的脱氢，从而获得高丙烯选择性。

3. 高温稳定性：开发在高温（520°C）下长时间（超过120小时）保持优异稳定性的SAA催化剂，这与之前仅限于低温应用的SAA不同。

4. 优化金属比例：仔细控制铜与铂的比例，以实现所需的催化性能和稳定性。

5. 表征技术：使用先进的表征方法（如CO-DRIFTS）来关联CO吸附行为与催化剂初始活性，从而优化催化剂组成。

这些进展通过以下方式解决了催化剂设计、制造和性能优化方面的挑战：

1. 打破在传统合金催化剂中通常观察到的活性-选择性权衡。
2. 提高催化剂在工业相关高温下的稳定性。
3. 在保持合理脱氢活性的同时提高丙烯选择性。
4. 提供了一种新的催化剂设计方法，可能应用于其他工业重要反应。
5. 提供了催化剂结构与性能关系的见解，使得能够更有针对性地开发工业应用催化剂。
