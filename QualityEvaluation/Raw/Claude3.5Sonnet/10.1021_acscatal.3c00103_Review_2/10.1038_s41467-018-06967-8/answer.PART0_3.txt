The key strategies and approaches recently developed to enhance catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts in direct dehydrogenation processes include:

1. Development of single atom alloy (SAA) catalysts, specifically Pt/Cu SAA, which breaks the traditional PtM alloy scaling relationship. This results in greatly improved propylene selectivity with only a slight loss in intrinsic dehydrogenation activity.

2. Use of high copper to platinum ratio in catalyst synthesis, achieved through incipient wetness co-impregnation method on γ-alumina support.

3. Employing atomic dilution to disperse single Pt atoms on Cu nanoparticles, creating a stable structure that maintains performance at high temperatures (520°C) for extended periods (over 120 hours).

4. Optimization of metal ratios and synthesis methods to achieve isolated Pt atoms in the metallic state, which serve as promising active sites for high-temperature alkane dehydrogenation.

These advancements address challenges in catalyst design and performance optimization by:

1. Breaking the traditional scaling relationship that usually limits simultaneous improvements in activity and selectivity.

2. Significantly improving catalyst stability, as demonstrated by the much lower deactivation rate of the Pt/Cu SAA catalyst compared to conventional Pt catalysts.

3. Enabling high-temperature operation (520°C) with maintained stability, which is crucial for industrial applications.

4. Providing a new approach to catalyst fabrication that allows for precise control of active site structure at the atomic level.

These strategies collectively contribute to the development of more efficient, selective, and stable catalysts for direct dehydrogenation processes, potentially improving their viability for industrial applications.

最近开发的用于提高直接脱氢过程中负载金属催化剂催化稳定性的关键策略和方法包括：

1. 开发单原子合金（SAA）催化剂，特别是Pt/Cu SAA，打破了传统PtM合金的标度关系。这导致丙烯选择性大幅提高，同时仅略微降低了本征脱氢活性。

2. 在催化剂合成中使用高铜铂比，通过在γ-氧化铝载体上进行浸渍共浸渍法实现。

3. 采用原子稀释法将单个Pt原子分散在Cu纳米颗粒上，创造出一种在高温（520°C）下长时间（超过120小时）保持性能的稳定结构。

4. 优化金属比例和合成方法，实现金属态下的孤立Pt原子，这些原子作为高温烷烃脱氢的潜在活性位点。

这些进展通过以下方式解决了催化剂设计和性能优化方面的挑战：

1. 打破通常限制活性和选择性同时提高的传统标度关系。

2. 显著提高催化剂稳定性，这从Pt/Cu SAA催化剂比传统Pt催化剂低得多的失活率可以看出。

3. 实现高温（520°C）操作的同时保持稳定性，这对工业应用至关重要。

4. 提供了一种新的催化剂制备方法，允许在原子水平上精确控制活性位点结构。

这些策略共同促进了更高效、更选择性和更稳定的直接脱氢过程催化剂的开发，可能提高它们在工业应用中的可行性。
