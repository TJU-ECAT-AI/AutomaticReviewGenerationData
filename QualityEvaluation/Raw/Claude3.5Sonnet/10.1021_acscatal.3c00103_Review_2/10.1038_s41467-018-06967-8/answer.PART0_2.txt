[1] "Herein, we report that Pt/Cu single atom alloy (SAA) breaks the PtM alloy scaling relationship during the PDH, with a great improvement of propylene selectivity and a slight loss of intrinsic dehydrogenation activity."

[2] "Unlike previous reported SAA applications at low temperatures (<400C), Pt/Cu SAA shows excellent stability of more than 120h of operation under atmospheric pressure at 520C."

[3] "We synthesize γ-alumina-supported platinum/copper SAA catalysts by incipient wetness co-impregnation method with a high copper to platinum ratio."

[4] "Single platinum atoms dispersed on copper nanoparticles dramatically enhance the desorption of surface-bounded propylene and prohibit its further dehydrogenation, resulting in high propylene selectivity (90%)."

[5] "During the PDH at 520C, the propylene formation rate dramatically dropped from 3.7 to 1.6molg1Pth1 for 0.1Pt/Al2O3 after 12h on stream. As a contrast, we did not observe deactivation for 0.1Pt10Cu/Al2O3 upon 12h on stream and the propylene formation rate only slightly decreased from 10.6 to 10.3molg1Pth1 even after 120h on stream."

The key strategies and approaches recently developed to enhance catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts in direct dehydrogenation processes include:

1. Development of single atom alloy (SAA) catalysts: Specifically, Pt/Cu SAA catalysts have been designed to break the PtM alloy scaling relationship, improving propylene selectivity while maintaining good dehydrogenation activity.

2. Atomic dilution method: γ-alumina-supported Pt/Cu SAA catalysts are synthesized using incipient wetness co-impregnation with a high copper to platinum ratio. This allows for single platinum atoms to be dispersed on copper nanoparticles.

3. Optimizing metal interactions: The isolated Pt atoms on Cu nanoparticles enhance propylene desorption and inhibit further dehydrogenation, leading to high selectivity.

4. High-temperature stability: Unlike previous SAA applications limited to low temperatures, these Pt/Cu SAA catalysts show excellent stability for over 120 hours at 520°C under atmospheric pressure.

5. Improved coke resistance: The Pt/Cu SAA catalysts demonstrate significantly better resistance to deactivation compared to traditional Pt catalysts, maintaining high propylene formation rates over extended periods.

These advancements address challenges in catalyst design by improving selectivity, activity, and stability simultaneously. They optimize performance for industrial applications by maintaining high catalytic activity and selectivity over long periods at industrially relevant temperatures, potentially reducing the frequency of catalyst regeneration or replacement in industrial processes.

最近开发的提高直接脱氢过程中负载金属催化剂催化稳定性的关键策略和方法包括：

1. 开发单原子合金（SAA）催化剂：特别是，Pt/Cu SAA催化剂被设计用于打破PtM合金的定标关系，提高丙烯选择性的同时保持良好的脱氢活性。

2. 原子稀释方法：通过使用高铜铂比的浸渍共浸渍法合成γ-氧化铝负载的Pt/Cu SAA催化剂。这允许单个铂原子分散在铜纳米粒子上。

3. 优化金属相互作用：铜纳米粒子上的孤立铂原子增强了丙烯的脱附并抑制进一步脱氢，从而导致高选择性。

4. 高温稳定性：与之前仅限于低温应用的SAA不同，这些Pt/Cu SAA催化剂在520°C、大气压下表现出120多小时的优异稳定性。

5. 提高抗积碳能力：与传统Pt催化剂相比，Pt/Cu SAA催化剂表现出显著更好的抗失活能力，在长时间内保持高丙烯生成率。

这些进展通过同时改善选择性、活性和稳定性，解决了催化剂设计中的挑战。它们通过在工业相关温度下长时间保持高催化活性和选择性来优化工业应用性能，可能减少工业过程中催化剂再生或更换的频率。
