The key strategies and approaches recently developed to enhance the catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts in direct dehydrogenation processes include:

1. Development of single atom alloys (SAAs): The study focuses on Pt/Cu SAA catalysts, which show excellent stability at high temperatures (520°C) for extended periods (over 120 hours).

2. Synthesis method: The γ-alumina-supported platinum/copper SAA catalysts are synthesized using an incipient wetness co-impregnation method with a high copper to platinum ratio.

3. Breaking the scaling relationship: The Pt/Cu SAA breaks the PtM alloy scaling relationship, which is different from conventional Pt alloys during propane dehydrogenation (PDH). This allows for simultaneous improvement in activity and selectivity.

4. Atomic dispersion: Single platinum atoms dispersed on copper nanoparticles enhance the desorption of surface-bounded propylene and inhibit its further dehydrogenation, resulting in high propylene selectivity.

5. Low metal loading: The Pt/Cu SAA catalyst with low Pt loading (0.1wt%) demonstrates high propylene selectivity and formation rate under specific reaction conditions.

These advancements address challenges in catalyst design, fabrication, and performance optimization for industrial applications by:

1. Improving catalyst stability at high temperatures, which is crucial for industrial processes.
2. Enhancing selectivity towards desired products (propylene in this case) while maintaining high activity.
3. Utilizing low amounts of precious metals (Pt) through atomic dispersion, potentially reducing costs.
4. Developing a synthesis method that can be scaled up for industrial production.
5. Overcoming the traditional trade-off between activity and selectivity by breaking the scaling relationship.

These strategies demonstrate significant progress in creating more efficient and stable catalysts for direct dehydrogenation processes, potentially leading to improved industrial applications in the future.

最近开发的提高直接脱氢过程中负载金属催化剂催化稳定性的关键策略和方法包括：

1. 开发单原子合金（SAAs）：研究重点是Pt/Cu SAA催化剂，在高温（520°C）下长时间（超过120小时）表现出优异的稳定性。

2. 合成方法：使用浸渍共浸渍法合成γ-氧化铝负载的铂/铜SAA催化剂，铜与铂的比例较高。

3. 打破标度关系：Pt/Cu SAA打破了PtM合金的标度关系，这与常规Pt合金在丙烷脱氢（PDH）过程中的情况不同。这使得活性和选择性能够同时提高。

4. 原子分散：分散在铜纳米颗粒上的单个铂原子增强了表面结合丙烯的脱附，并抑制其进一步脱氢，从而获得高丙烯选择性。

5. 低金属负载：低Pt负载（0.1wt%）的Pt/Cu SAA催化剂在特定反应条件下表现出高丙烯选择性和生成速率。

这些进展通过以下方式解决了催化剂设计、制造和性能优化方面的挑战：

1. 提高催化剂在高温下的稳定性，这对工业过程至关重要。
2. 提高对目标产物（本例中为丙烯）的选择性，同时保持高活性。
3. 通过原子分散利用少量贵金属（Pt），可能降低成本。
4. 开发可用于工业生产的可放大合成方法。
5. 通过打破标度关系，克服了活性和选择性之间的传统权衡。

这些策略展示了在创造更高效、更稳定的直接脱氢过程催化剂方面的重大进展，有可能在未来改进工业应用。
