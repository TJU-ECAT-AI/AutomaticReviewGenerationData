The key strategies and approaches recently developed to enhance the catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts in direct dehydrogenation processes include:

1. Development of single atom alloys (SAAs): The study focuses on Pt/Cu SAA catalysts, which show excellent stability at high temperatures (520°C) for extended periods (over 120 hours).

2. Synthesis method: The γ-alumina-supported platinum/copper SAA catalysts are synthesized using an incipient wetness co-impregnation method with a high copper to platinum ratio.

3. Breaking the scaling relationship: The Pt/Cu SAA breaks the PtM alloy scaling relationship, which is different from conventional Pt alloys during propane dehydrogenation (PDH). This allows for simultaneous improvement in activity and selectivity.

4. Atomic dispersion: Single platinum atoms dispersed on copper nanoparticles enhance the desorption of surface-bounded propylene and inhibit its further dehydrogenation, resulting in high propylene selectivity.

5. Low metal loading: The Pt/Cu SAA catalyst with low Pt loading (0.1wt%) demonstrates high propylene selectivity and formation rate under specific reaction conditions.

These advancements address challenges in catalyst design, fabrication, and performance optimization for industrial applications by:

1. Improving catalyst stability at high temperatures, which is crucial for industrial processes.
2. Enhancing selectivity towards desired products (propylene in this case) while maintaining high activity.
