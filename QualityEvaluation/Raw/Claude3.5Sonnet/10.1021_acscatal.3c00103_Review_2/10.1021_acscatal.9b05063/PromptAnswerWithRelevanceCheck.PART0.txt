<EnglishVersionAnswer>

The provided literature does not contain any information about strategies or approaches to enhance the catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts in direct dehydrogenation processes. The text appears to be only the title, authors, and publication details of a research article about CrZrOx catalysts for propane dehydrogenation. It does not include any content about catalyst design, fabrication, or performance optimization for industrial applications. Without access to the full text of the article, it is not possible to answer the question based on the given information.
