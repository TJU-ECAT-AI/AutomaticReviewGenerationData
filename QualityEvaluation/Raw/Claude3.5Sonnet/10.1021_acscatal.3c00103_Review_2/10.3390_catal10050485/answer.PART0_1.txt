[1] "Pt-based catalysts are still regarded as the most effective catalysts for PDH process, especially when working with a promoter, such as In, Sn, Ga or Zn, which can further improve propylene selectivity"

[2] "ZnO was employed as the support for PtIn/Mg(Al)O catalytic system on account of its good stability."

[3] "The In0 has been proved to promote the transfer of coke from the active site to the support and the stabilization of the active metal species"

[4] "The formation of meixnerite can adjust the acidbase properties of the catalyst and improve its coke resistance"

[5] "The propane conversion and propylene selectivity of the catalyst reduced with H2/N2 can reach 51% and 97%, respectively, and even stabilize at 45% and 92% after running for 30 h. This is mainly attributable to its high Pt dispersion and In0/In3+ molar ratio, strong PtIn interaction and small metal particle size, which also result in a low content of coke deposits on the surface of the H2/N2-reduced catalyst."

Recent strategies to enhance catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts in direct dehydrogenation processes include:

1. Using promoters: Adding elements like In, Sn, Ga or Zn to Pt-based catalysts improves propylene selectivity.

2. Selecting stable supports: ZnO is used as a support due to its good stability.

3. Optimizing metal states: Increasing the In0/In3+ ratio promotes coke transfer from active sites to the support and stabilizes active metal species.

4. Modifying acid-base properties: Formation of meixnerite adjusts acid-base properties and improves coke resistance.

5. Controlling reduction atmosphere: H2/N2 reduction leads to high Pt dispersion, strong PtIn interaction, and small metal particle size, resulting in improved stability and low coke deposition.

These advancements address challenges in catalyst design by optimizing metal-support interactions, improving coke resistance, and enhancing overall stability and selectivity for industrial applications.

近期提高直接脱氢过程中负载金属催化剂稳定性的策略包括：

1. 使用助剂：向铂基催化剂中添加In、Sn、Ga或Zn等元素，提高丙烯选择性。

2. 选择稳定的载体：使用ZnO作为载体，因其具有良好的稳定性。

3. 优化金属状态：提高In0/In3+比例，促进焦炭从活性位转移到载体，并稳定活性金属物种。

4. 调节酸碱性质：形成meixnerite，调节酸碱性质，提高抗焦性能。

5. 控制还原气氛：使用H2/N2还原leads导致高Pt分散度、强PtIn相互作用和小金属颗粒尺寸，从而提高稳定性并降低焦炭沉积。

这些进展通过优化金属-载体相互作用、改善抗焦性能以及提高整体稳定性和选择性，解决了催化剂设计中的挑战，适用于工业应用。
