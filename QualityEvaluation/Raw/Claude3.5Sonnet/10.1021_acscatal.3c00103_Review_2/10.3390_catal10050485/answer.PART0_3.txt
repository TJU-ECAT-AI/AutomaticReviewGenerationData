Recent strategies to enhance catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts in direct dehydrogenation processes include:

1. Using promoters: Adding elements like In, Sn, Ga or Zn to Pt-based catalysts to improve propylene selectivity.

2. Optimizing support materials: Utilizing supports like Al2O3, SiO2, ZrO2, zeolites, and especially Mg(Al)O oxides obtained from hydrotalcite compounds (HT) due to their suitable acid-base properties, high thermal stability, large surface area, and memory effect.

3. Stabilizing HT-based catalysts: Combining with graphene networks, growing on metal or alloy substrates, and loading on oxide materials.

4. Promoting coke transfer: Increasing In0 content to facilitate the transfer of coke from active sites to the support, stabilizing active metal species.

5. Forming meixnerite: Encouraging the formation of high-crystallinity meixnerite to maintain high dispersion and uniform distribution of surface metal active sites during reaction.

6. Adjusting acid-base properties: The formation of meixnerite helps adjust the catalyst's acid-base properties, improving coke resistance.

These advancements address challenges in catalyst design, fabrication, and performance optimization by focusing on improving selectivity, stability, and coke resistance. They aim to maintain high catalytic activity over extended periods, which is crucial for industrial applications. The strategies involve careful selection and modification of both the active metal components and support materials to create synergistic effects that enhance overall catalyst performance and longevity.
