[1] "The support materials, Al2O3 [11], SiO2 [6], ZrO2 [12,13] and zeolite [3,14], can also affect catalytic performance on account of the significant differences in textural properties."

[2] "Especially, the Mg(Al)O oxides obtained by calcining hydrotalcite compounds (HT) have been studied extensively during the past years, owing to their suitable acidbase properties, high thermal stability, large surface area and memory effect [15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23]."

[3] "Simultaneously, the stability of support plays an important role in reactions. Many works have been tried to stabilize the HT-based catalysts by combining with graphene networks [17,24], growing on metal (Al, Ni) or alloy substrates [25,26] and loading on oxide materials (γ-Al2O3, ZnO, SnO2) [27,28,29]."

[4] "The In0 has been proved to promote the transfer of coke from the active site to the support and the stabilization of the active metal species [40,41]."

[5] "As a kind of HT with an interlayer -OH anion, the high crystallinity meixnerite may be helpful to keep the high dispersion and uniform distribution of surface metal active sites during reaction. As a result, the good stability of the H2/N2-reduced sample can arise from the formation of meixnerite to a certain extent [17]."

Recent strategies and approaches to enhance catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts in direct dehydrogenation processes include:

1. Careful selection of support materials: Different supports like Al2O3, SiO2, ZrO2, and zeolites can significantly impact catalytic performance due to their varied textural properties. Mg(Al)O oxides derived from calcined hydrotalcite compounds have gained attention for their suitable acid-base properties, high thermal stability, large surface area, and memory effect.

2. Stabilization of hydrotalcite-based catalysts: Researchers have explored various methods to improve the stability of HT-based catalysts, such as combining them with graphene networks, growing them on metal or alloy substrates, and loading them on oxide materials like γ-Al2O3, ZnO, and SnO2.

3. Promotion of coke transfer: Incorporating In0 species has been shown to promote the transfer of coke from active sites to the support, thereby stabilizing the active metal species and maintaining catalyst performance.

4. Formation of meixnerite: The high crystallinity meixnerite, formed during the reaction process, helps maintain high dispersion and uniform distribution of surface metal active sites, contributing to improved catalyst stability.

5. Optimization of reduction atmosphere: The study demonstrates that the reduction atmosphere significantly influences the physicochemical properties and catalytic performance of the catalyst. For example, H2/N2 reduction led to higher Pt dispersion, increased In0/In3+ ratio, stronger PtIn interaction, and smaller metal particle size, resulting in improved stability and coke resistance.

These advancements address challenges in catalyst design, fabrication, and performance optimization by focusing on support material selection, active site stabilization, coke management, and reduction process optimization. These strategies aim to enhance catalyst longevity, maintain high activity and selectivity, and improve overall performance for industrial applications in direct dehydrogenation processes.
