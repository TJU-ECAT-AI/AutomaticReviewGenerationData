[1] "The stability of support plays an important role in reactions. Many works have been tried to stabilize the HT-based catalysts by combining with graphene networks, growing on metal (Al, Ni) or alloy substrates and loading on oxide materials (γ-Al2O3, ZnO, SnO2)"

[2] "The smaller metal particles are more active for propane dehydrogenation performance and beneficial to resist the coke deposition"

[3] "The formation of meixnerite can adjust the acidbase properties of the catalyst and improve its coke resistance"

[4] "As compared with the diffraction strength of meixnerite, the only direct evidence is that the diffraction strength of graphite and the amount of deposited coke (see TG analysis below) show an opposite trend in accordance with the order from H2/N2- to C3H8/H2/N2- and C3H8-reduced catalysts."

[5] "The lowest coke formation on H2/N2-reduced catalyst should be related to the small metal particle size, strong PtIn interaction and suitable acidbase properties caused by the formation of meixnerite."

Recent strategies to enhance catalytic stability of supported metal catalysts in direct dehydrogenation processes include:

1. Stabilizing the support: Combining hydrotalcite-based catalysts with graphene networks, growing them on metal/alloy substrates, or loading them on oxide materials.

2. Optimizing metal particle size: Smaller metal particles are more active and resist coke deposition better.

3. Adjusting acid-base properties: Formation of meixnerite can improve coke resistance by modifying the catalyst's acid-base characteristics.

4. Controlling reduction atmosphere: H2/N2 reduction leads to smaller metal particles, stronger metal-support interactions, and formation of meixnerite, all contributing to improved stability and coke resistance.

5. Enhancing metal-support interactions: Strong interactions between the active metal (e.g., Pt) and promoters (e.g., In) or the support material can improve stability.

These advancements address challenges in catalyst design and performance optimization by focusing on support stability, metal dispersion, coke resistance, and tuning of surface properties. They aim to prolong catalyst lifetime, maintain high activity and selectivity, and reduce deactivation in industrial applications.

最近在直接脱氢过程中提高负载金属催化剂催化稳定性的策略包括：

1. 稳定载体：将水滑石基催化剂与石墨烯网络结合，在金属/合金基底上生长，或负载在氧化物材料上。

2. 优化金属粒子尺寸：较小的金属粒子活性更高，更能抵抗积炭沉积。

3. 调整酸碱性质：美斯奈特的形成可以通过改变催化剂的酸碱特性来提高抗积炭能力。

4. 控制还原气氛：H2/N2还原导致金属粒子更小，金属-载体相互作用更强，并形成美斯奈特，所有这些都有助于提高稳定性和抗积炭能力。

5. 增强金属-载体相互作用：活性金属（如Pt）与助剂（如In）或载体材料之间的强相互作用可以提高稳定性。

这些进展通过关注载体稳定性、金属分散度、抗积炭能力和表面性质调节来解决催化剂设计和性能优化方面的挑战。它们旨在延长催化剂寿命，保持高活性和选择性，并减少工业应用中的失活。
